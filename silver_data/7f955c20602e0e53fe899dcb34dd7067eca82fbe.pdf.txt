Actophorin consists of 138 amino acids ( calculated molecular weight of 15 543 ) and shares a high degree of sequence similarity to other low molecular weight actin monomer sequestering proteins , especially vertebrate cofilin , vertebrate actin depolymerizing factor / destrin , and echinoderm depactin . Actophorin is smaller and does not contain a nuclear localization sequence like the related vertebrate proteins . Southern blot analysis indicates that actophorin is a single - copy gene ; however , Northern blots show two distinct mRNA species of 1 and 0 . 9 kb in size . Homogeneous recombinant actophorin purified from Escherichia coli is indistinguishable from the native protein in its physical properties and in biochemical assays of its interaction with actin , but is less reactive with three monoclonal antibodies raised against the native protein . The NH2 terminus of native actophorin is blocked , while the initiating methionine residue is removed from recombinant actophorin . This difference has no measurable effect on activity . By fluorescent antibody staining of Acanthamoeba , actophorin colocalizes with actin filaments in the cortical cytoplasm , especially at the leading edge of the cell . Additionally , actophorin binds phosphatidylinositol 4 ' , 5 ' - bisphosphate . The recombinant actophorin forms X - ray diffraction quality crystals of superior quality in poly ( ethy1ene glycol ) / 2 - propanol and , like the native crystal form , belongs to space group P212121 . Acanthamoeba actophorin is a low molecular weight actin monomer binding / actin filament severing protein ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 ) that shares some functional properties with two vertebrate proteins , actin depolymerizing factor , ADF ( Bamburg et al . , 1980 ; Adams et al . , 1990 ; Abe et al . , 1990 ) , and destrin ( Nishida et al . , 1985 ; Moriyama et al . , 1990b ) , and with echinoderm egg depactin ( Mabuchi , 1981 ; Takagi et al . , 1988 ) . The vertebrate proteins are homologues of each other and of depactin . Surprisingly , all of these proteins are similar in sequence to cofilin ( Nishida etal . , 1984 ; Yonezawaet al . , 1985 ; Abeetal . , 1990 ; Matsuzaki et al . , 1990 ; Adams et al . , 1990 ; Moriyama et al . , 1990a ) , another vertebrate actin binding protein with distinct properties including time and place of expression ( Abe et al . , 1990 ; Ohta et al . , 1989 ) and high affinity for actin filaments ( Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ; Nishida , 1985 ) . Polyphosphoinositides inhibit the binding of cofilin and destrin to actin ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) . These proteins may regulate actin polymerization in the cell by severing actin filaments and / or by sequestering actin monomers , but their physiological functions are far from clear .

Actophorin isolated from Acanthamoeba castellanii is a 15 - kDa protein with two established biochemical activities . First , by forming a 1 : 1 complex with monomeric actin ( Cooper et al , 1986 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 ) , actophorin can regulate the pool of actin available for polymerization . Second , actophorin severs actin filaments in a dose - dependent manner . Both sequestering and severing are inhibited by orthophosphate ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . In the presence of the cross - linking protein a - actinin , actin filament severing by actophorin promotes the formation of rigid actin bundles that are visible by light microscopy ( Maciver et al . , 1991b ) . In this paper , we present the primary structure of actophorin , characterize recombinant actophorin isolated in high yield from Escherichia coli , and localize the protein in the cortex of Acanthamoeba with fluorescent antibodies . The sequence of actophorin is closer to that of cofilin than to the ADF group with which it shares more functional properties . Although recombinant actophorin lacks the modified NH2 - terminal methionine , it is indistinguishable from the native protein in its physical and functional properties except for reduced reactivity with three monoclonal antibodies . MATERIALS AND METHODS General Molecular and Biochemical Procedures . Unless otherwise noted , all procedures performed in this study are according to Maniatiset al . ( 1982 ) or Sambrooket al . ( 1989 ) , including bacteria and phage plating , agarose gel electro - phoresis , restriction endonuclease digestions , library screening , and Southern and Northern blotting . Chemical reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) unless specifically mentioned . Protein concentration was determined either by using the method of Bradford ( 1976 ) with bovine serum albumin as standard or by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm ( a 1 mg / mL solution of actophorin has an A280 value of 0 . 89 ; Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . 0006 - 2960 / 93 / 0432 - 8525 $ 04 . 00 / 0 0 1993 American Chemical Society 8526 Biochemistry , Vol . 32 , No . 33 , 1993 Native Protein Purification and Peptide Sequencing . Native actophorin was purified from Acanthamoeba castel - lanii according to Cooper et al . ( 1986 ) . Peptides were generated from actophorin by the method of Ampe et al . ( 1988 ) . Briefly , 200 pg of actophorin was cleaved with either trypsin , cyanogen bromide ( CNBr ) , or 2 - [ ( 2 - nitropheny1 ) - sulfenyl ] - 3 - methyl - 3 - bromoindolenine ( BNPS - skatole ) . The resulting peptides were separated by HPLC on a C4 reversed - phase column ( 0 . 46 X 25 cm ; Vydac Separations Group , Hesperia , CA ) . Peptides were eluted at 1 mL / min with a linear gradient of 0 - 7095 acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid . The gradient was started 5 min after sample loading . Peptides were detected by the absorbanceat 214 nm , collected manually in 1 . 5 - mL Eppendorf tubes , and dried in a Rotovac prior to storage at - 20 " C . Edman degradation was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Inc 470 A gas - phase sequenator , and the amino acids were determined with a 120 A phe - nylthiophydantoin amino acid analyzer following manufac - turer instructions . Isolation of an Actophorin cDNA Clone . An Acan - thamoeba XgtlO cDNA library ( Pollard & Rimm , 1991 ) was screened with two oligonucleotides based on the amino acid sequence of two peptides using the biased codon usage of Acanthamoeba ( Hammer et al . , 1987 ) . Oligonucleotide A AGGTGAT - 3 ' ) is complementary to nucleotides 238 - 273 ( amino acid residues 80 - 9 1 ) . Oligonucleotide B ( 5 ' - GC - 3 ' ) is complementary to nucleotides 187 - 222 ( amino acid residues 63 - 74 ) . These oligonucleotide probes were radio - labeled at their 5 ' ends with [ Y - ~ ~ P ] ATP using T4 polynu - cleotide kinase and used to select a clone ( X2 . 1 . 1 ) with a 900 bp insert . The insert was released with EcoRI , isolated from an agarose gel using the Glassmilk method ( BiolO 1 , La Jolla , Ca ) , and subcloned into pUC18 . The resulting construct , pSM 1 , was utilized for sequence analysis . Nucleotide Sequence Determination . Double - stranded DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy termination method ( Sanger et al . , 1977 ) using Sequenase version 2 . 0 ( USB ) . Sequencing was routinely carried out according to instructions provided by USB except that sequence labeling reactions were performed on ice . Both strands were fully sequenced using oligonucleotide primers constructed from sequence determined in the previous round of sequencing . Additional DNA sequencing was performed on X2 . 1 . 1 using the Applied Biosystems Inc . Model 373A automatic DNA sequencer . Sequence analysis and database searches were performed using the GCG package of computer programs from the University of Wisconsin running on a VAX 8530 computer . Construction of an Actophorin Expression Plasmid . The expression plasmid PACT was created using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) directed mutagenesis of X2 . 1 . 1 . A unique NdeI site was introduced prior to the initiation ATG codon using the oligonucleotide 5 ' - CGGAATTCATATGTCC - GGCATTGCTGTCTCTGACGA - 3 ' . This changed the two underlined base pairs in the 5 ' - noncoding region of the sequence but not the amino acid sequence . Similarly , a uniqueBamH1 site was introduced at the 3 ' end of the coding sequence immediately downstream from the TAG termination codon using the oligonucleotide S - AGAGGTGGGGACAGAGG - GATZCGTCTA - 3 ' . The final PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the expression vector pMW172 ( Rosenberg et al . , 1987 ) which had been digested with NdeI and BamHI and dephosphorylated . The sequence ( 5 ' - GGGGGCCGAGTCGGGGGCCCAGAGGATGA - CGTCCACCTGGAACTCGTAGTCGAAGATGGCGTA - Quirk et al . of the expression construct was verified by DNA sequencing . Expression and Purification of Recombinant Actophorin . Plasmid PACT containing BL21 ( DE3 ) cells ( Rosenberg et al . , 1987 ) was grown at 37 OC in Luria broth supplemented with 60 pg / mL ampicilin from a 2 % inoculum . IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM when the cells had reached an A595 value of 1 . 0 ( in approximately 3 - h post - inoculation ) . Cell growth continued for 5 additional h before harvesting . Typically , 3 g of cells was obtained per liter . Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at lOOOOg for 10 min and resuspended in 1 volume of 10 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 8 . 0 . The cells were respun as above and resuspended in 2 volumes of 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) / 1 mM EDTA / 1 mM sodium azide ( buffer I ) . The cells were disrupted by two passages through a French press . The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 12OOOg for 20 min , and the supernatant was designated as fraction I . Fraction I was diluted to a final concentration of 10 mg / mL with buffer I . Then 400 mg of solid ( NH4 ) zSOd was added slowly to each milliliter of solution at 4 " C with constant stirring . After 30 min on ice , the solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 12000g , and the supernatant was decanted . Recombinant actophorin was precipitated from the super - natant by the addition of 300 mg of solid ( NH & S04 per original milliliter of solution . The pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of buffer I and dialyzed versus 2 L of buffer I at 4 OC overnight . The dialysate was designated as fraction 11 . Fraction I1 was chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G - 75 ( 1 . 8 cm2 X 110 cm ) in buffer I . The major peak containing actophorin activity was pooled and concentrated to a final volume of 2 mL by pressure filtration through a semipermeable membrane ( Amicon YM - 3 ) . The concen - trated material constituted fraction 111 . Fraction I11 was applied to a Mono Q column ( 0 . 2 cmz X 6 cm ) in buffer I and eluted with a linear KCl gradient ( 0 - 60 mM ) using a Pharmacia FPLC system . Homogeneous actophorin eluted at approximately 45 mM KCI . The pooled peak , designated fraction IV , was used without further modification unless otherwise noted . Viscometry Assay . The apparent low - shear viscometry assay was performed essentially as described by Maclean - Fletcher and Pollard ( 1 980 ) . Briefly , 10 pM monomeric actin is polymerized in a 100 - pL capillary tube ( Corning Glass , New York , NY ) containing various amounts of recombinant or native actophorin in 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgS04 , 1 mM EGTA , and 10 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 8 . 0 . Once mixed , the tubes are incubated at room temperature ( approximately 25 " C ) for 1 h . A steel ball is dropped through the suspension , and the time required for the ball to traverse the length of the tube is measured and is here defined as apparent viscosity . A unit of actophorin is the amount of protein ( in micrograms ) required to reduce the apparent low - shear viscosity by 50 % . Actin Polymerization Assuy . Actin was labeled with N - ( 1 - pyreny1 ) iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes Inc . , Eugene , OR ) as described by Pollard ( 1984 ) . Additionally , the pyrenylactin was further purified by dialysis against 2 L of 2 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaClZ , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 3 mM sodium azide at 4 " C overnight followed by gel exclusion chromatography through Sephacryl S - 300 . Spon - taneous polymerization at 25 " C was initiated by mixing actin monomers ( 6 % pyrene labeled ) , actophorin , and concentrated salts to give a final buffer composition of 50 mM KCI , 1 mM MgS04 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaC12 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 10 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 8 . 0 . The increase in pyrenylactin fluorescence during polymerization was moni - Studies of Acanthamoeba Actophorin tored at an emission wavelength of 407 nm ( emission slit width of 10 nm ) postexcitation at 365 nm ( excitation slit width of 3 nm ) on a Perkin - Elmer 650 - 10s spectrometer . Monoclonal Antibodies and Antibody Assays . Monoclonal antibodies against native actophorin were produced and characterized according to Kiehart et al . ( 1984 ) . The mice were immunized with 100 pg of pure actophorin isolated from Acanthamoeba . Enzyme - linked immunoadsorbant assays ( ELISAs ) were performed by adsorbing 1 pg of antigen ( either native or recombinant actophorin ) to the surface of 96 - well microtiter plates ( Immulon 2 ; Dynatech Laboratories , Chan - tilly , VA ) . After the wells were blocked with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) supplemented with 10 % nonfat dry milk , monoclonal antibodies in blocking solution were added at various dilutions and allowed to react with the antigen at room temperature for 1 h . Following three washes in PBS , goat anti - mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish per - oxidase was added at a 1 : 2000 dilution ( in blocking buffer ) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature . After washing as above , color development is achieved by adding 100 pL of a solution containing 50 mM sodium citrate , 50 mM citric acid , 1 mg / mL o - phenylenediamine , and 0 . 006 % H202 . After suitable color development ( typically 5 - 10 min of incubation at room temperature ) , 50 pL of 2 M sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction and stabilize the product . Absorbance was measured using an automatic ELISA plate reader ( Bio - Tek Instruments , Inc . ) . Western blots ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) were made according to Kaiser et al . ( 1989 ) . Crystallization and X - ray Diffraction of Recombinant Actophorin . Purified recombinant actophorin ( fraction IV ) was dialyzed versus 4 L of 50 mM sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 9 , 2 mM DTT , and 1 mM sodium azide at 4 OC for 12 h . The dialyzed material was pressure - filtered as above to a final concentration of 5 mg / mL . Crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion through hanging drops at room temperature using poly ( ethy1ene glycol ) 8000 ( PEG 8000 ) as the precipitant . Alternatively , recombinant actophorin fraction IV was dia - lyzed versus 4 L of 100 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 mM DTT , and 1 mM sodium azide at 4 OC for 12 h and concentrated as above . Large isomorphous crystals were obtained as above using a combination of PEG 8000 and 2 - propanol as the precipitating agents . CuKa X - rays were generated with a Rigaku RU - 200 rotating - anode generator operating at 40 kV and 140 mA equipped with a graphite monochromator . Complete datasets were measured on single crystals at room temperature by w scans of 0 . 25 ' . Frames were recorded for 240 s each . Diffraction measurements were collected by a Siemens / Nicolet multiwire area detector mounted on a Huber four - circle goniostat and processed using XENGEN ( Howard et al . , 1987 ) . RESULTS Protein Sequence Analysis . We obtained much of the primary structure of actophorin by Edman degradation of purified peptide fragments produced by trypsin , CNBr and BNPS - skatole cleavage ( Figure 1 ) . Edman degradation of the intact native actophorin gave no yield , so that NH2 - terminus is blocked . We did not determine the blocking group . The peptide fragments gave a contiguous sequence spanning amino acid residues 14 - 135 ( Figure 1 ) . CNBr and BNPS - skatole fragments allowed us to order the tryptic peptides . CNBr - 9 allowed the ordering of peptides T15 - Tll - Tl9 , and CNBr - 6 was important in ordering peptides T6 - T2 and the COOH - terminus . The sequences of fragments derived from cleavage with 2 - [ ( 2 - nitrophenyl ) sulfenyl ] - 3 - methyl - 3 - bro - moindolenine yielded the alignment T20 - T6 .

Nucleotides and amino acids are numbered to the right of the sequence , starting from the A in the initiating codon for DNA and the initiating M for protein . The asterisk corresponds to the stop codon . The portion of the amino acid sequence confirmed by modified Edman degradation of purified recombinant actophorin is boxed .

This protein + hemical analysis covered the entire sequence except for the extreme NHz - terminal and COOH - terminal residues of the protein . We looked for but did not observe modified amino acids in this analysis ; furthermore , we could not assign cysteine residues . Cloning and Sequencing of an Acanthamoeba Actophorin cDNA . The nucleotide sequence of a full - length actophorin cDNA clone contained a 414 bp open reading frame corre - sponding to a protein of 138 amino acid residues , with a calculated mass of 15 543 Da . The deduced amino acid sequence confirms the amino acid sequence determined by peptide analysis ( Figure l ) , provides the sequence of the extreme amino and carboxyl termini , and establishes the cysteine positions that were not available from the peptide analysis . There are no sequence ambiguities between the two methods . The cDNA is GC - rich and has the same highly restricted codon usageas other Acanthamoebagenes ( Hammer et al . , 1987 ) . The cDNA sequence as illustrated in Figure 1 has been reported to Genbank and assigned Accession Number M93361 . The entire 5 ' - noncoding sequencing was refractory to complete sequence analysis , perhaps due to unusual secondary structure elements . The sequence of this region ( approxi - mately 300 bp ) could not be determined either by automatic 8528 Biochemistry , Vol . 32 , No . 33 , 1993 95 - Quirk et al .

After Southern blotting , the nitrocellulose filter is probed with the entire 32P - labeled actophorin cDNA and autoradiographed .

The size of the transcripts is indicated . sequencing or by sequencing with thermostable DNA poly - merases at elevated temperature ( data not shown ) . In addition , the 5 ' - noncoding region of the actophorin cDNA was unstable in plasmid constructs and was often found to be deleted . This was observed in several different plasmids and in several different genetic backgrounds ( data not shown ) . Sequence Similarity to Other Actin BindinglSevering Proteins . A FASTA search ( Pearson & Lipman , 1988 ) of the Genbank Release 70 database revealed that actophorin has significant amino acid sequence similarities to cofilin , ADF , destrin , and depactin ( Table I ) . Thirteen residues are identical in the eight proteins . The amino acid sequence of actophorin is closer to the cofilins than it is to destrin or ADF . Actophorin SouthernlNorthern Analysis . Digests of Acan - thamoeba genomic DNA with HindIII , EcoRI , BglI , or PstI all yielded single bands that hybridize with the entire actophorin coding region ( Figure 2A ) ; hence , actophorin is a single - copy , intronless gene . Two distinct RNA species hybridize equally well with the actophorin cDNA ( Figure 2B ) . The transcripts differ in size by about 100 bases The smaller message ( 0 . 9 kb ) probably results in the cDNA of X2 . 1 . 1 upon reverse transcription . overproduction and Isolation of Recombinant Actophorin . Bacteria with the expression plasmid PACT synthesize high levels of soluble and active actophorin ( Figure 3 , lane I ) . The solubility of the recombinant actophorin simplifies its puri - fication . The falling - ball viscometry assay can measure the 43 6ol 291 ' ' 1 FIGURE 3 : Purification of recombinant actophorin .

Protein loads are as follows : lane I , 20 pg ; lane 11 , 15 pg ; lanes 111 - V , 6 pg . Proteins are visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie brilliant blue . Molecular mass markers are indicated . specific activity of actophorin in crude bacterial extracts due to the absence of eukaryotic actin binding proteins that normally mask or inhibit actophorin activity in Acanthamoeba preparations . Nearly homogeneous material results from the ammonium sulfate fractionation ( Figure 3 , lane 11 ) . The few remaining contaminating bands are removed by size - exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G - 75 and by chromatography on Mono Q ( Figure 3 , lanes I11 and IV ) . Overproduction of recombinant actophorin in induced BL21 ( DE3 ) cells harboring PACT , coupled with our modified purification procedure , yields 1 . 3 mg of pure recombinant actophorin per gram of bacterial cell paste in less than 1 week ( Table I1 and Figure 3 ) . This yield per gram of cells is 100 times higher than the purification from Acanthamoeba ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . Edman degradation of the N - terminal region of purified recombinant actophorin ( Figure 1 ) confirms the identity of the overexpressed material as bona fide actophorin and reveals that the initiating methionine residue is removed by E . coli as a posttranslational modification . Physical Properties of Native and Recombinant Actophorin . The electrophoretic mobility of recombinant actophorin agrees with that predicted from the primary sequence and the native molecular weight established previously ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . Recombinant actophorin is chromatographically and elec - trophoretically ( Figure 3 , lane V ) indistinguishable from the native protein , including the observation that under nonre - ducing conditions the protein forms disulfide - linked dimers that elute from gel exclusion columns as a 30 - kDa species ( data not shown ) . By analytical gel filtration in Sephadex G75 ( Siege1 & Monty , 1966 ; data not shown ) , recombinant actophorin has a Stokes radius of 21 A and a frictional ratio ( flfo ) of 1 . 3 , values like the native protein ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . Native isoelectric focusing experiments in polyacry - lamide gels ( data not shown ) indicate that recombinant actophorin has a pl of 6 . 9 compared to a PI of 6 . 0 for native actophorin . This difference apparently arises from the lack of a blocked N - terminus in the recombinant protein . The stabilities of native and recombinant actophorin assessed by urea denaturation profiles are identical ( Figure 4 ) . Both spectra show a decrease in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence with increasing urea concentrations . The midpoint of the single transition occurs between 3 . 0 and 3 . 5 M urea .

The emission wavelength maximum shifts from 325 nm ( 0 . 0 M urea ) to 355 nm ( 8 . 0 M urea ) . Functional Comparisons of Native and Recombinant Actophorin . Both the native and recombinant actophorins decrease the low - shear viscosity of actin filament gels to the same extent ( Figure 5 ) . This suggests that the N - terminal modification of the native protein , which is absent in the recombinant material , is not required for actophorin function . Substoichiometric concentrations of recombinant actophorin accelerated the spontaneous polymerization of pyrenylactin ( Figure6 ) like the native protein ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ; Maciver 120 I I I I I 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time ( min ) FIGURE 6 : Spontaneous polymerization of pyrenylactin in the presence of recombinant actophorin .

Reactivity of Recombinant Actophorin with Monoclonal Antibodies . Recombinant and native actophorins differ in their reactivity for three different monoclonal antibodies raised to native actophorin ( one example is shown in Figure 7 ) . These monoclonal antibodies react with the recombinant protein , although compared with the native protein approximately 40 - fold more antibody is required to saturate the assay . All three anti - actophorin monoclonal antibodies were specific for actophorin on Western blots of crude protein extracts of Acanthamoeba ( one example is shown in Figure 7 , insert .

Recombinant actophorin at 60 pM was reacted with various amounts of phos - phatidylinositol 4’ , 5’ - bisphosphate , PIP2 ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , micelles in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris - HC1 ( pH 7 . 5 ) / 75 mM KC1 in a final reaction volume of 250 pL . Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 10 min , at which time the entire sample was loaded on a Sephadex G - 100 column ( 43 cm X 0 . 2 cm2 ) and chromatographed in the same buffer . Fractions ( 0 . 5 mL ) were collected and analyzed for protein content . Bound protein was determined by subtracting the calculated amount of free protein ( the area under the eluted actophorin peak ) from 60 pM . The open circle shows that recombinant actophorin does not intract with 200 pM phosphatidylserine . actophorin formed routinely in 3 - 5 days . Crystals are obtained using 18 - 20 % ( w / v ) PEG 8000 , a lower concentration than has been previously described ( Magnus et al . , 1988 ) . Like the crystallization of the native protein , the inclusion of a reducing agent ( DTT ) is required for proper crystal formation . Crysals form as thick prismatic needles with approximate dimensions of 1 . 0 mm X 0 . 08 mm X 0 . 04 mm . Thicker prismatic needle crystals can be obtained by using 20 % ( w / v ) PEG 8000 / 10 % ( v / v ) 2 - propanol buffered in 100 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) as precipitants . These crystals grow to approximate dimensions of 1 . O mm X 0 . 1 mm X 0 . 1 mm . The crystal habit of recombinant actophorin ( obtained by both precipitation methods ) is similar to that of native protein crystals . X - ray diffraction measurements confirm that the space group of the PEG 8000 / 2 - propanol recombinant actophorin crystals is P212121 , the same as the native crystal space group . The area detector data collection statistics presented in Table I11 show that the recombinant crystal form is better suited for structure determination studies than the native crystal form . The lower Rsym and B values for the recombinant actophorin crystals indicate that these crystals have higher internal order than do the native crystals . This may be due to the absence of N - terminal modifications present in the native material . The recombinant actophorin crystals diffract more intensely than the native protein crystals as evidenced by the almost doubling of the ( I ) / . value . Both the native and recombinant crystals diffract to approximately the same resolution , and the unit cell volumes differ by only 0 . 7 % . Binding of PIP2 to Recombinant Actophorin . PIP2 micelles interact with recombinant actophorin in a concentration - dependent fashion as assayed by small - zone gel filtration ( Figure 8 ) . This interaction is specific , as recombinant actophorin has no affinity for phosphatidylserine ( Figure 8 , open circle ) . Binding interactions are observed at PIP2 : actophorin ratios ranging from 1 . 7 : 1 to 3 . 3 : 1 . At the lower ratio , only 9 % of the protein is bound , while at the higher ratio 74 % of the protein is bound . By fitting the binding curve to a second - order polynomial and extrapolating , it is possible to bind all of the recombinant actophorin at a PIP2 concentration Table 111 : Crystal and X - ray Data Collection Statistics for Native and Recombinant Actophorin actophorin parameter native recombinant space group unit - cell parameters ( A ) a b C a ! = = Y ( del31 observations ( no . ) unique reflections ( no . ) completeness ( % ) to 2 . 6 8 , completeness ( 7 % ) to 2 . 5 A diffraction data ( I ) / @ B ( A2 ) b RwmC p2121 . 21 39 . 8 47 . 3 69 . 9 90 . 0 14822 3576 76 . 3 71 . 8 12 . 3 36 . 2 0 . 093 p212121 39 . 6 47 . 6 69 . 3 90 . 0 2304 1 4446 94 . 2 86 . 2 22 . 4 31 . 5 0 . 05 1 ( I ) / a is the average intensity divided by the standard deviation for all reflections .

Acto - phorin is concentrated in the cortex of Acanthamoeba ( Figure 9C , D ) together with rhodamine - phalloidin - stained actin filaments ( Figure 9E , F ) . The staining for both actophorin and actin filaments was most prominent at the part of the cell that appears by morphological criteria to be the leading edge during movement . In about 20 % of cells , the edge of a large internal vacuole is brightly stained with both anti - actophorin ( Figure 10A ) and rhodamine - phalloidin . Another 10 % of stained cells have an irregular cup - shaped surface appendage ( Diaz et al . , 199 1 ) that stained for both actophorin and actin filaments ( Figure 10B , C ) . There was no detectable nuclear staining .

Second antibody alone did not stain the cells ( data not shown ) . Additionally , all the labeling studies above were performed as single - label experiments ( data not shown ) to control for possible artifacts or fluorescence signal bleeding between the rhodamine and fluorescein channels . The fluorescent antibody staining was identical in the single - and double - label experiments . DISCUSSION The primary structure confirms that Acanthamoeba ac - tophorin is a member of the family of small monomer binding / filament severing proteins isolated from diverse species . Actophorin is over 60 % similar to the cofilins and actin depolymerizing protein ( e . g . , porcine destrin ) from vertebrates ( Table I and Figure 2 ) , including 13 amino acid residues that are positionally conserved in the entire family . The similarity is particularly striking around two sites implicated in the binding of cofilin to actin . The first is the DAIKKK amino acid sequence of cofilin ( amino acid residues 123 - 1 28 ) . This peptide competes with cofilin for binding to actin monomers ( Matsuzaki et al . , 1988 ) and is contained in actophorin as the sequence DSIKKK ( residues 103 - 109 ) . The second conserved sequence is in the region of the cofilin dodecapeptide WAPESAPLKSKM ( residues 104 - 1 15 ) . This sequence has been shown to be a site of actin monomer binding ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991 ) and corresponds to the actophorin peptide WAPDSAPIKSKM ( residues 85 - 96 ) . Point mutations of Lysll4 reduce the affinity of cofilin for F - actin with a parallel decrease in filament severing ( Moriyama et al . , 1992 ) . Substitutions of both Lysll2 and Lysll4 resulted in a complete lack of F - actin binding . The sequence of actophorin is closer to the amino acid sequence of cofilin than it is to the sequence of destrin or ADF . This is surprising considering that biochemical properites of actophorin are more similar to destrin / ADF . In particular , cofilin binds to actin filaments ( Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ; Nishida , 1985 ) while actophorin severs actin filaments but does not bind tightly to them . Atomic structures of these proteins will be required to understand the basis of these differences . The major difference between actophorin and all of the related proteins is that actophorin is shorter by approximately 30 residues . In general , there are five small internal regions in cofilin not represented in actophorin . One of the deletions removes an SV40 large T - antigen - type nuclear transport signal , PXXXKKRKAV ( Kalderon et al . , 1984 ) . It is not known whether the nuclear targeting of the actin - modulating proteins is important to cytoskeletal actin regulation in higher organisms or serves some other unrelated function . Accord - ingly , no actophorin was detected in the nucleus by fluorescent antibody staining . In contrast , despite sequence similarities , neither the monoclonal antibodies used in this study nor polyclonal antibodies cross - react with protein extracts of other species , including yeast ( data not shown ) . Additionally , there is no cross - reactivity of polyclonal antibodies between actophorin and depactin ( T . D . Pollard and I . Mabuchi , unpublished observations ) . Bamburg and Bray ( 1987 ) also found that antibodies against chicken embryonic brain ADF do not recognize Acanthamoeba proteins . Clearly , the 35 amino acids shared by destrin and actophorin are insufficient for antibody cross - reactivity . The purification procedure outlined in Table I1 yields a large amount of homogeneous actophorin that is indistin - guishable from the native protein in most ways . The identical stability in urea and the formation of crystals of the same space group with nearly identical unit - cell dimensions indicate very similar three - dimensional structures . The decrease in quantum yield upon denaturation in urea may indicate that the single tryptophan of actophorin is relatively isolated from side chain interactions in the folded molecule . Additionally , recombinant actophorin accelerates the rate of spontaneous pyrenylactin polymerization by severing actin filaments in a dose - dependent fashion . The kinetics of actin filament severing by recombinant actophorin observed by the pyrenylactin polymerization assay are in accord with similar experiments with the native material ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . Like native 8532 Biochemistry , Vol . 32 , No . 33 , 1993 actophorin ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) , recombinant actophorin has no effect on the lag period of the pyrenylactin polymer - ization process , or any significant effect on the steady - state concentration of actin filaments . Remarkably , although recombinant actophorin has chro - matographic , hydrodynamic , and stability properties similar to native actophorin , it reacts weakly with three different monoclonal antibodies by ELISA . The epitopes for these monoclonals have not been mapped , but a possible explanation is that the posttranslational modifications of the NH2 - terminus of the native protein , the only known modification of the native protein , might constitute part of a major epitope . The charge difference might also influence the adsorption of the proteins to the ELISA wells . Recombinant actophorin interacts with PIP2 , like related proteins [ e . g . , see Yonezawa et al . ( 1990 ) l . Yet the physi - ological implications of polyphosphoinositide binding are not clear . The interaction , however , does seem to be specific , as actophorin does not bind to phosphatidylserine in small - zone gel filtration assays . Studies to carefully determine kinetic binding constants between actophorin ( or any other member of the actophorin - like family ) and polyphosphoinositides are needed , The colocalization of actophorin and actin in the cortex of Acanthamoeba may provide some clues about the functions of actophorin . Given the low affinity of actophorin for actin filaments , we did not anticipate that they would be found together in the cytoplasm . Perhaps the concentration of actin in the cortex ( on the order of 1 mM ) is high enough to drive the binding of actophorin simply by mass action . If so , the actophorin may play an active role in limiting the length of the cortical actin filaments and promoting the assembly of actin filament bundles as demonstrated in vitro ( Maciver et al . , 1991 b ) . Severing of actin filaments without capping may also contribute to the rapid assembly and turnover of actin filaments observed in the cortex of other cells especially at the leading edge of locomoting cells [ e . g . , see Wang ( 1985 ) and Forscher and Smith ( 1988 ) ] . For example , if actophorin severed filaments once they reached some critical size , this would expose a new barbed end with ADP - actin which would tend to depolymerize . The existence of two actophorin transcripts may represent alternative splicing products or the processing of larger transcripts . Since we have no evidence for actophorin isomers from gel electrophoresis , isoelectric focusing , or protein sequencing , the two transcripts most probably code for the same protein . In contrast , Acanthamoeba express at least three isoforms of profilin ( Pollard & Rimm , 1991 ) . The cloning of the gene encoding actophorin , and the expression and purification of large amounts of the recom - binant protein , is an important step in our effort to determine its structure . The recombinant protein not only forms superior crystals but also has been modified with selenomethionine for phase determination . The three - dimensional structure of Acanthamoeba actophorinshould shed light on themechanism of action of the entire family of small actin monomer binding / actin filament severing proteins .
