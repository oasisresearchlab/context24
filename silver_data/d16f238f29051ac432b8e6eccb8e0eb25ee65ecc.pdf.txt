Cortactin is a substrate for Src and other protein tyrosine kinases involved in cell motility , where its phosphorylation on tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 in the carboxyl terminus is required for cell movement and metastasis . In spite of the importance of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in cell motility , little is known regarding the structural , spatial or signaling requirements regulating cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . Here we report that phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosine residues in the carboxyl terminus requires the amino terminal domain and Rac1 - mediated localization to the cell periphery . Phosphorylation - specific antibodies directed against tyrosine 421 and 466 were produced to study the regulation and localization of tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin . Phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosine 421 and 466 was elevated in response to Src , EGF receptor and Rac1 activation , and tyrosine 421 phosphorylated cortactin localized with F - actin in lamellipodia and podosomes . Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is progressive , with tyrosine 421 phosphorylation required for phosphorylation of tyrosine 466 . These results indicate that cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation requires Rac1 - induced cortactin targeting to cortical actin networks , where it is tyrosine phosphorylated in hierarchical fashion that is closely coordinated with its ability to regulate actin dynamics . 4 Introduction Cell movement involves coordination of multiple signaling pathways regulating cell - substratum adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics ( Mitichison and Cramer , 1996 ; Webb , et al . , 2002 ) . Initiation of motility requires cell polarization and formation of the leading edge at the migratory front . The main “organelle” at the leading edge responsible for motility is the lamellipodium , formed as a result of nascent polymerization and remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Small , et al . , 2002 ) . Lamellipodia formation requires activation of the small GTPase Rac1 , which occurs following engagement and activation of several growth factor and adhesion receptors ( Hall , 1998 ) . Rac1 signals regulating lamellipodia formation are mediated in part through multiple pathways that activate members of the WAVE / Scar protein family ( Miki , et al . , 2000 ; Eden , et al . , 2002 ) . WAVE / Scar proteins interact with F - and G - actin ( Suetsugu , et al . , 2001 ) , and with Arp2 / 3 complex , the molecular “machine” that nucleates the formation of branched actin networks ( Higgs and Pollard , 2001 ; Cooper , et al . , 2001 ) . Interaction of WAVE / Scar proteins with Arp2 / 3 complex leads to enhanced Arp2 / 3 complex actin nucleation activity , resulting in increased cortical actin polymerization and lamellipodia protrusion ( Borisy and Svitkina , 2000 ) . Rac1 targets WAVE / Scar along with several other actin - binding proteins that regulate actin dynamics in lamellipodia ( Miki , et al . , 1998 , Mishima and Nishida , 1999 ; Kessels , et al . , 2000 ) . Lamellipodia adhere through integrin - based adhesion complexes with the extracellular matrix . Adhesion complexes within lamellipodia ( focal “contacts” ) are formed concurrently with actin networks in response to Rac1 ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) and share many of the same proteins that are found in focal “adhesions” , larger , distally occurring cell - substratum contact sites regulated by RhoA ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . Assembly and regulation of focal contacts and 5 adhesions requires the activity of several tyrosine kinases , including Src ( Craig and Johnson , 1996 ) . Rac1 activation translocates Src into lamellipodia ( Fincham , et al . , 1996 ) , where its kinase activity is required for proper lamellipodia and focal contact formation ( Timpson , et al . , 2001 ; Prasad , et al . , 2002 ) , indicating that Src substrates in lamellipodia are important in regulating lamellipodia dynamics . Several Src substrates associated with the actin cytoskeleton are not components of cell - substratum adhesion complexes ( Brown and Cooper , 1996 ) . One of these is cortactin , a multi - domain protein enriched within lamellipodia ( Wu , et al . , 1991 ) . Cortactin interacts with Arp2 / 3 complex ( Weed , et al . , 2000 ; Uruno , et al . , 2001 ) and F - actin ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) , interactions that are required for Rac1 - induced cortactin translocation to the cortical actin network ( Weed , et al . , 2000 ; DiCiano , et al . , 2002 ) . Cortactin stimulates Arp2 / 3 actin nucleation activity and prevents disassembly of Arp2 / 3 - F - actin networks ( Weaver , et . al . , 2001 ; Uruno , et al . , 2001 ) , suggesting that cortactin plays a direct role in lamellipodia protrusion and integrity . Multiple signaling pathways that activate Rac1 also lead to cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Weed and Parsons , 2001 ) . Src phosphorylates murine cortactin on three tyrosine residues ( 421 , 466 and 482 ) within a proline - rich carboxyl terminal domain ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ) , residues that are also phosphorylated by the kinases Fer ( Kapus , et al . , 2000 ) and c - Met ( Crostella , et al . , 2001 ) . Phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 is required for efficient cell motility in several cell types , indicating that cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in cell migration ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ; Crostella , et al . , 2001 ) . However , the structural and temporal requirements , as well as the intracellular signaling pathways regulating cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation are unknown . 6 We have examined the domain requirements for cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation and determined that phosphorylation of cortactin by Src requires the Arp2 / 3 and F - actin binding domains . Site specific antibodies against cortactin phosphotyrosine 421 and 466 indicate that phosphorylation of these residues occurs in a hierarchical manner , is dependent on targeting to the cortical actin network and is regulated by the activation state of Rac1 . Tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin is enriched in lamellipodia . We propose that cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is coordinated with actin remodeling , where it may serve to integrate and transduce signals involved in cell migration . 7 Materials and Methods DNA Constructs The FLAG - tagged cytomegalovirus driven cortactin expression construct pcDNA3FLAG2AB cortactin ( FLAG - FL ) ( Du , et al . , 1998 ) was used as the template for production of cortactin constructs containing tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutations of codons 421 , 466 and 482 . Mutation of individual residues was conducted by site - directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) following the manufacturers’ protocol . All primers were designed as described ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ) , synthesized by Gibco / BRL ( Gaithersburg , MD ) and HPLC purified . Constructs with more than one mutation were created by successive rounds of mutagenesis . Mutation of each codon was confirmed individually by DNA sequencing . FLAG - N - term ( NT ) and FLAG - C - term ( CT ) cortactin constructs were as described ( Weed , et al . , 2000 ) . The FLAG - C - term construct with triple tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at codons 421 , 466 and 482 ( CT - T ) was generated as a KpnI - EcoRI fragment as described ( Weed , et al . , 2000 ) using FLAG - FL with the three phenylalanine mutations ( FL - T ) as a template , and subcloned into KpnI - EcoRI digested pcDNA3FLAG2AB ( Devarajan et al . , 1997 ) . FLAG - tagged coronin1 was generated by PCR amplification of the coronin1 cDNA in pCR2 . 1 ( Okumura , et al . , 1998 ) with the 5’ primer containing a KpnI restriction endonuclease site and the 3’ primer containing a stop codon followed by an EcoRI site . The amplified cDNA was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and subcloned into KpnI - EcoRI digested pcDNA3FLAG2AB . For production of the coronin1 - cortactin C - term hybrid construct ( FLAG - coronin1 - CT ) , a KpnI - BamHI PCR fragment spanning full length coronin1 cDNA lacking the stop codon was ligated in frame with a BamHI - EcoRI fragment from pRK5myc - C - term ( Weed , 8 et al . , 2000 ) and KpnI - EcoRI digested pcDNA3LFAG2AB . pRK5myc , pRK5myc Rac1N17 and pRK5myc Rac1L61 were described previously ( Lamarche , et al . , 1996 ) . All PCR - generated constructs were verified by DNA sequencing .

These rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunization of 13 - mer peptides surrounding the sites of phosphorylation for both pY421 and pY466 and were purified using both negative and positive affinity purification methods to optimize specificity for the targeted phosphoepitope . Specificity was demonstrated using peptide competition assays ( our unpublished results ) and through the analysis of site - directed mutants for each tyrosine as shown in Figure 3 A , B .

For immunofluoresence studies , transfected cells were plated onto coverslips coated with 40 µ g / ml fibronectin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and processed as described ( Weed , et al . , 1998 ) . For the production of motile cells , C3H 10T1 / 2 cells were plated onto glass coverslips and grown to confluence for 48 h . Monolayers were scraped with a plastic pipette tip and cells were cultured for 4 h before fixation and processing for immunofluoresence microscopy .

Immunofluoresence Microscopy Cells were fixed and immunolabeled as described ( Weed , et al . , 1998 ) except that IF buffer ( Schafer , et al . , 1998 ) was substituted for PBS . Epitope - tagged constructs were detected with M5 ( 5 µ g / ml ) or 9E10 ( 1 : 1000 ) . Endogenous cortactin was detected with either anti - N - term ( 1 µ g / ml ) or 4F11 ( 0 . 25 µ g / ml ) . Anti - cortactin pY421 was used at 1 - 2 µ g / ml . AlexaFlour 594 phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) was used at 1 : 1000 . Primary monoclonal antibodies were detected with anti - mouse AlexaFlour 594 for double labeling and anti - mouse AlexaFlour 647 for triple labeling experiments ; rabbit primary antibodies were detected with anti - rabbit AlexaFlour 488 . All secondary antibodies were used at 1 µ g / ml . Labeled coverslips were mounted with the 11 AntiFade kit ( Molecular Probes ) and cells were viewed using a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan Aprochromat 60X objective lens . Images were acquired with a Spot RT charge coupled cooled device ( Diagnostic Instruments , Sterling Heights , MI ) driven by native software and were processed on a Macintosh computer with Adobe Photoshop software . A minimum of 90 cells were evaluated for each condition , with at least 85 % of the cells demonstrating the represented effects except where noted . Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation For evaluation of anti - cortactin pY421 and 466 antibodies , 10T1 / 2 cells transfected with pcDNA3FLAG2AB , FLAG - FL , FLAG - 421F , FLAG - 466F or FLAG - FL - T were washed in PBS containing 1mM NaVO 4 and lysed in ice - cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer ( RIPA ) ( Du , et al . , 1998 ) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( 1 : 200 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14 , 000 g for 10 min , and 50 µ g of total cell protein was resolved by SDS - PAGE and assayed by Western blotting . EGF - mediated cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation was evaluated by treatment of serum - starved NeoR1 cells with 5ng / ml EGF for the indicated time periods . Cells were lysed in modified RIPA and 100 µ g of protein was analyzed by Western blotting with anti - pY421 , anti - pY466 , 4F11 , anti - activated EGFR and anti - EGFR antibodies ; 150 µ g of protein were used for Src analysis Cells expressing FLAG - cortactin constructs were lysed in modified RIPA and 1 mg of each clarified lysate was incubated with 25 µ l of FLAG M2 affinity resin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 2 h at 4°C . Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation , washed twice with modified RIPA , separated by SDS - PAGE , and Western blotted with antibodies as described . For precipitation of endogenous cortactin , 25 µ l of ImmunoPure Plus immobilized Protein A agarose 12 beads ( Pierce , 50 % slurry in PBS ) were precharged with 7 . 5 µ g of rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) in 500 µ l of PBS for 2 h . Beads were washed twice with PBS , resuspended in 500 µ l PBS and incubated with 5 µ g 4F11 overnight . After washing the beads twice with PBS , cortactin was immunoprecipitated from modified RIPA lysates ( 500 µ g protein ) of C3H 10T1 / 2 , NIH 3T3 527F and Rat1 v - src cells by incubation with 4F11 - charged beads for 2 h . Immune complexes were processed for Western blotting as described above . Protein concentrations were determined using the DC Protein Assay ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) with BSA as the standard . In vitro kinase assays For analysis of cortactin phosphorylation by Src , C3H 10T / 12 cells transfected with FLAG - cortactin constructs were lysed in modified RIPA and immunoprecipitated with FLAG M2 resin as described . Immune complexes were washed twice with modified RIPA buffer , once with PBS containing 2M KCl , and once with kinase buffer ( 50mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 , 5mM MnCl 2 ) . Complexes were incubated in kinase buffer containing 10 µ Ci [ γ - 32 P ] - ATP ( NEN / Perkin Elmer , Boston , MA ) with or without 1U of purified Src ( Upstate ) in a final volume of 50 µ l . Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 10 min , stopped with an equal volume of hot 2X SDS - PAGE sample buffer , resolved by SDS - PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes ( Amersham / Pharmacia ) . Following autoradiography , membranes were stripped as above , exposed to X - ray film overnight to ensure removal of all radiolabel , then blotted with anti - N - term and C - term cortactin antibodies . 13 Results The Amino - terminal Domain is Required for Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the Cortactin Carboxyl Terminus Previous work has demonstrated that Src phosphorylates murine cortactin primarily on tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 within the carboxyl - terminal proline rich domain ( Fig . 1A ; Huang , et al . , 1998 ) . To investigate the extent of phosphorylation of each individual tyrosine in response to c - Src activation in vivo , a panel of all possible combinatorial mutations of tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 to phenylalanine were produced in a FLAG - tagged wild type cortactin expression construct by successive rounds of site directed mutagenesis . Wild type FLAG - cortactin ( FL ) and mutant constructs were transfected into 5Hd47 fibroblasts , a non - transformed variant of C3H 10T1 / 2 cells that exhibits 10 fold c - Src overexpression ( Wilson and Parsons , 1990 ) . As shown in Figure 1B , FL ( wild type ) cortactin gave a robust signal when immunoprecipitated and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting with the pan - phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 . The single mutation of tyrosine 421 ( 421F ) to phenylalanine resulted in a significant reduction in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation compared to FL cortactin , whereas single mutations of either tyrosine 466 or tyrosine 482 to phenylalanine ( 466F and 482F , respectively ) had less of an effect , with phosphotyrosine levels reduced slightly below that of FL cortactin . Cortactin constructs containing the pairwise mutant combinations 421F / 466F and 421F / 482F exhibited diminished phosphotyrosine levels similar to that of 421F , while the 466F / 482F construct was still abundantly phosphorylated . A cortactin construct containing tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation of all three sites ( 421F / 466F / 482F ) resulted in further ( but not complete elimination of ) detectable phosphotyrosine levels . In agreement with previous results ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ) these data indicate that codons 421 , 466 and 482 are the tyrosine residues on murine cortactin 14 phosphorylated by c - Src , with tyrosine 421 being the primary site of Src - mediated cortactin phosphorylation in vivo . In vitro , Src directly phosphorylates a recombinant cortactin polypeptide encoding the proline - rich carboxyl terminal domain ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ) . To determine if Src - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin requires the presence of additional cortactin domains besides the proline - rich region in vivo , FLAG - tagged cortactin constructs , including constructs encoding either the amino - ( N - term ) or carboxyl - ( C - term ) cortactin domains ( Fig . 1 A ) were transfected into C3H 10T1 / 2 and 5Hd47 fibroblasts , and the overexpressed cortactin fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti - FLAG resin . Tyrosine phosphorylation of the expressed cortactin proteins was determined by Western blotting with RC - 20 ( Fig . 1C , top panels ) and expression of each cortactin peptide was verified by immunoblotting with anti - cortactin antibodies ( Fig . 1C , bottom panels ) . While full - length , wild type cortactin ( FL ) was tyrosine phosphorylated when expressed in C3H 10T1 / 2 cells , its phosphorylation was significantly enhanced when expressed in 5Hd47 fibroblasts ( Fig . 1C ; note lower expression levels of FL in 5Hd47 ) . Expression of FLAG - cortactin 421F / 466F / 482F ( FL - T ) displayed diminished but dectable tyrosine phosphorylation compared to wild - type cortactin when expressed in either C3H 10T1 / 2 or 5Hd47 cells . Interestingly , FLAG - N - term ( NT ) displayed a low but consistently reproducible ( n = 3 ) level of tyrosine phosphorylation in C3H 10T1 / 2 cells that was not elevated in 5Hd47 cells . Surprisingly , expression of FLAG - C - term ( CT ) , which contains the tyrosine residues targeted by Src , was not detectably tyrosine phosphorylated ( Fig . 1C ) , as was a FLAG - C - term construct with the triple tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at 421 , 466 and 482 ( CT - T ) . The lack of tyrosine phosphorylation in the CT construct suggested that Src - mediated 15 phosphorylation of the cortactin carboxyl - terminal domain requires the presence of the cortactin amino terminus . To verify that the lack of phosphorylation of the carboxyl - terminal domain was not due to misfolding and subsequent lack of recognition by Src , FLAG - cortactin constructs were expressed in C3H 10T1 / 2 cells , immunoprecipitated with anti - FLAG resin and washed with 2M KCL to remove associated proteins . Immune complexes were incubated with purified Src and [ γ - 32 P ] - ATP , and resolved by SDS - PAGE . Atuoradiography ( Fig . 1D , top ) demonstrated efficient phosphorylation of FLAG - FL and the FLAG - CT , with little phosphorylation of either FLAG - FL - T , FLAG - NT or FLAG - CT - T . Stripping and probing of the membrane with anti - cortactin antibodies confirmed precipitation of the FLAG - cortactin proteins ( Fig . 1D , bottom ) . These data support the conclusion that the amino - terminal cortactin domain is tyrosine phosphorylated independent of Src activity , and that phosphorylation of the C - terminal cortactin domain by Src requires the presence of the cortactin amino terminus . Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the Cortactin Carboxyl Terminus Requires Localization to the Cell Cortex The amino - terminal cortactin domain is required for Rac1 - mediated targeting of cortactin to the cell periphery , a process that involves direct association with F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Weed , et al . , 2000 ) . To determine if the inability of the cortactin C - terminal domain to become tyrosine phosphorylated required Rac1 - mediated localization of the cortactin carboxyl terminal domain to the cell cortex , a FLAG - tagged construct was created where the C - terminal cortactin domain was fused in frame to the C - terminus of the unrelated actin - binding and lamellipodia protein coronin1 ( Fig . 2A ) . Coronin1 also targets to the cortical actin cytoskeleton in a Rac1 - dependent manner and directly binds Arp2 / 3 complex , but is not tyrosine 16 phosphorylated ( Mishima and Nishida , 1999 ; Humphries , et al . , 2002 ) . We selected this strategy over examining cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation following direct perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasian D or latrunculin B since these drugs lead to robust Src activation , potentially resulting in aberrant cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Lock , et al . , 1998 ) . To determine whether the coronin1 - cortactin C - term ( coronin1 - CT ) construct restored the ability of the cortactin carboxyl terminal domain to become tyrosine phosphorylated , COS - 1 cells were transfected with FLAG - coronin1 and FLAG - coronin1 - CT , along with FLAG - FL , FLAG - CT and FLAG - CT - T as controls . FLAG - tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and tyrosine phosphorylation of recombinant proteins was analyzed by Western blotting with RC - 20 . Both FLAG - FL and FLAG - coronin1 - CT were tyrosine phosphorylated , whereas FLAG - CT , FLAG - CT - T and FLAG - coronin1 were not ( Fig . 2B , top ) . The blot was stripped and precipitation of the FLAG - tagged proteins was verified by immunoblotting blotting with anti - FLAG M5 ( Fig . 2B , bottom ) . These data indicate that fusion of the cortactin carboxyl terminus to coronin1 restores the ability of the carboxyl terminal cortactin domain to become tyrosine phosphorylated . To determine if the FLAG - coronin proteins targeted to the cell periphery in response to Rac1 activation , C3H 10T1 / 2 cells were cotransfected with constitutively active myc - RacL61 and FLAG - FL , FL - T , CT , CT - T , coronin1 and coronin1 - CT . Following transfection , cells were trypsinized and plated on fibronectin - coated coverslips . Under these conditions , C3H 10T1 / 2 cells expressing RacL61 exhibit a rounded morphology , and cortactin localization at the cell periphery is dependent on the presence of the amino - terminal domain ( Weed , et al . , 2000 ) . In agreement with these previous results , FLAG - FL and FL - T accumulated at the cell cortex with endogenous cortactin , while FLAG - CT and FLAG - CT - T failed to localize at the periphery and 17 remained cytoplasmic ( Fig . 2 C ) . FLAG - coronin1 and FLAG - coronin1 - CT also localized with cortactin at the cortex , although a large amount of both of these proteins was found in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2 C ) . In all cases , endogenous cortactin exhibited efficient cortical localization . Taken together , these data suggest that Rac1 - induced localization of cortactin to the cell cortex is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminal cortactin domain . Production and Specificity of Phosphorylation Specific Antibodies against Phosphorylated Tyrosine 421 and Tyrosine 466 of Murine Cortactin . Tyrosine 421 and 466 are the primary residues phosphorylated by c - and v - Src in murine cortactin ( Fig . 1B ; Huang , et al . , 1998 ) . In order to facilitate the analysis of these sites and to determine if these sites are phosphorylated in response to Rac1 - mediated cortical targeting , we developed antibodies specific to phosphotyrosine 421 and 466 of murine cortactin . To confirm the specificity of each antibody , C3H 10T1 / 2 cells were transfected with empty FLAG vector , FLAG - FL , FLAG - FL - T and either FLAG - FL with an individual tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at codon 421 for anti - pY421 analysis ( 421F ) or at codon 466 for anti - pY466 analysis ( 466F ) ( Fig . 3 A and B , respectively ) . Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with either anti - pY421 ( Fig . 3A ) or anti - pY466 cortactin antibodies ( Fig . 3 B ) . The anti - pY421 cortactin antibody detected endogenous cortactin as a doublet that migrated between 72 and 78 kDa by SDS - PAGE in lysates from cells expressing the empty FLAG vector ( V ) , FLAG - 421F and FL - T . However , an additional band migrating at approximately 80 kDa was detected in lysates from cells transfected with FLAG - FL ( Fig . 3 A ) , indicating that the anti - pY421 cortactin antibody selectively recognizes cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine 421 . Similar results were obtained with the anti - pY466 cortactin antibody , although two additional cross - reactive bands were 18 observed at approximately 125 and 47 kDa ( Fig . 3B ) . Nevertheless , the anti - pY466 antibody is specific for the cortactin epitope since it also detected FLAG - FL but failed to recognize either FLAG - 466F or FLAG - FL - T ( Fig . 3B ) . The additional band present in the FL lanes of the anti - 421 and 466 blots is FLAG - FL since this band is due to the slightly slower electrophoretic mobility caused by the presence of the FLAG - tag in the recombinant protein ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) . Stripping and reprobing of the blots with the anti - cortactin monoclonal antibody 4F11 resulted in a tight cortactin doublet in lysates containing FLAG - tagged cortactin proteins ( Fig . 3 A and B ) , with the recombinant FLAG - cortactin proteins constituting the slower migrating form of the two bands since this band was absent in lysates from cells transfected with the empty FLAG vector ( V ) . Immunoblotting of lysates with the anti - M5 monoclonal antibody ( anti - FLAG ) directly verified the expression of the FLAG - cortactin proteins , and equivalent loading of protein amounts was confirmed by stripping and immunoblotting for β - actin ( anti - β - actin ) ( Fig . 3 A and B ) . Collectively , these results show that the anti - pY421 and anti - pY466 cortactin antibodies specifically recognize their respective phosphoepitopes . To determine that the anti - phosphospecific cortactin antibodies detect tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin at codons 421 and 466 as a result of Src activation , cortactin was immunoprecipitated from murine fibroblasts with normal levels of c - Src activity ( C3H 10T1 / 2 ) , fibroblasts expressing a tyrosine to phenylalanine activating mutation in c - Src ( 3T3 527F ) and Rat1 fibroblasts expressing v - Src ( Rat1 v - Src ) . A substantial increase in cortactin phosphorylation was observed on tyrosine 421 and tyrosine 466 in cortactin from 3T3 527F and Rat1 v - Src fibroblasts compared to C3H 10T1 / 2 cells following immunoblotting with anti - pY421 and anti - pY466 antibodies ( Fig . 3 C ) . Stripping and reprobing of the blots with 4F11 indicated that equivalent amounts of cortactin were assayed ( Fig , 3 C ) , with the slower migrating 19 form of cortactin from Rat1 v - Src cells attributable to the larger size of cortactin in rat versus murine cells ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) . These results indicate that the anti - pY421 and anti - pY466 cortactin antibodies detect Src - mediated phosphorylation of murine cortactin at tyrosine 421 and 466 , and that these antibodies also detect phosphorylation of rat cortactin on these residues as expected from sequence analysis of both phosphorylation sites ( Fig . 8 ) . Given the specificity of the anti - pY421 and pY - 466 cortactin antibodies , we sought to determine if these sites were in part responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation within the cortactin carboxyl terminus observed in the cortical targeting of the FLAG - coronin1 - CT construct ( Fig . 2 B ) . C3H 10T1 / 2 cells were transfected with either empty FLAG vector , FLAG - FL , FLAG - FL - T , FLAG - NT , FLAG - CT , FLAG - CT - T , FLAG - coronin1 or FLAG - coronin1 - CT . Recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti - FLAG resin and tyrosine phosphorylation of FLAG - tagged proteins was analyzed by Western blotting with anti - pY421 and anti - pY466 cortactin antibodies . As shown in Figure 3 D , FLAG - FL and coronin1 - CT were the only proteins exhibiting phosphorylation of tyrosine 421 and 466 . All recombinant proteins were precipitated as determined by anti - FLAG M5 immunoblotting . Phosphorylation of tyrosine 421 and tyrosine 466 in the coronin1 - CT fusion protein therefore indicates that these two residues in the cortactin carboxyl terminus contribute to the tyrosine phosphorylation observed in this construct in Figure 2 B . Phosphorylation of Tyrosine 421 in Murine Cortactin is Required for Tyrosine 466 Phosphorylation . Several Src substrates containing multiple phosphorylation sites can be differentially regulated with respect to each other ( Guappone , et al . , 1998 ; Schaller and Schaefer , 2001 ; Ruest , 20 et al . , 2001 ) . To determine if phosphorylation of tyrosine 421 and 466 in cortactin occurs in an independent or interdependent manner in response to Src activation in vivo , 5Hd47 fibroblasts were transfected with the panel of FLAG - tagged cortactin constructs containing all possible tyrosine to phenylalanine mutational combinations of codons 421 , 466 and 482 ( Fig . 1 B ) . Expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti - FLAG resin , and tyrosine 421 and 466 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting with anti - pY421 and anti - pY466 cortactin antibodies ( Figure 4 ) . As expected , the anti - pY421 cortactin antibody detected all proteins where tyrosine 421 was not mutated to phenylalanine ( FL , 466F , 482F and 466F / 482F ) while cortactin constructs containing phenylalanine mutations at codon 421 ( 421F , 421F / 466F , 421F / 482F and 421F / 466F / 482F ) were not detected by anti - pY421 cortactin ( Fig . 4 ) . Interestingly , the anti - pY466 antibody only detected the FL and 482F proteins , failing to detect constructs where tyrosine 466 was intact in the context of a phenylalanine mutation at codon 421 ( 421F and 421F / 482F ) as well as constructs with phenylalanine present at codon 466 ( 466F , 421F / 466F , 466F / 482F and 421F / 466F / 482F ) ( Fig . 4 ) . This result indicates that the presence of a phosphorylated tyrosine residue at position 421 is required for phosphorylation of tyrosine 466 in murine cortactin in vivo , and that phosphorylation of tyrosine 421 and 466 is independent of tyrosine 482 phosphorylation . Localization of pY421 Cortactin with Cortical Actin Structures In non - transformed cells , cortactin localizes with the cortical F - actin network within lamellipodia and is also concentrated in a cytoplasmic pool near the perinucular region ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . In Src transformed fibroblasts , cortactin redistributes into cell - substratum contacts known as podosomes ( Wu , et al . , 1991 ) . To determine the subcellular localization of 21 tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin in normal and transformed cell types , C3H 10T1 / 2 and Rat1 vSrc fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of serum and immunolabeled with anti - pY421 cortactin ( Fig . 5 ) . In both motile ( Fig . 5 A ) and spreading ( Fig . 5 B ) C3H 10T1 / 2 cells , anti - pY421 cortactin labeling was concentrated primarily with F - actin and cortactin within lamellipodia , with labeling of the perinucular region observed to a lesser extent relative to the levels of total cortactin in the cytoplasm . Anti - pY421 cortactin exhibited strong labeling of podosomes in Rat 1 v - Src cells that also overlapped with F - actin and cortactin ( Fig . 5 C ) . Overlaying of individual images for F - actin , pY421 cortactin and total ( pan ) cortactin indicated that pY421 cortactin is enriched with the pool of cortactin that is associated with cortical actin in lamellipodia and podosomes ( Fig . 5 A - C ) . The anti - pY466 antibody failed to specifically label cortactin in cells ( data not shown ) , presumably due to the cross reactivity of this antibody with other cellular proteins ( Fig . 3 B ) . EGF Stimulates Phosphorylation of Cortactin on Tyrosine 421 and Tyrosine 466 EGF is known to stimulate cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in a Src - dependent manner ( Maa , et al . , 1992 ) . To determine if tyrosine 421 and tyrosine 466 of cortactin are phosphorylated in response to EGF , serum starved C3H 10T1 / 2 cells with 40 fold overexpression of EGFR ( NeoR1 ; Maa , et al . , 1995 ) , were treated with EGF and lysed at various time points over a 1 h period . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was subsequently analyzed by Western blotting of total cell extracts with anti - pY421 and anti - pY466 cortactin antibodies ( Fig . 6 A ) . Serum - starved NeoR1 cells exhibited low levels of pY421 and pY466 phosphorylation that was elevated by EGF treatment by 1min , increased after 5 min , decreased at 10 min and increased from 30 min to 1 h ( Fig . 6 A ) . The biphasic response of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in 22 NeoR1 cells in response to EGF is similar to that observed in cells overexpressing c - Src ( Maa , et al . , 1992 ) and in cells treated with FGF1 ( Zhan , et al . , 1993 ) . The changes in tyrosine 421 and 466 phosphorylation were not due to fluctuations in cortactin protein levels , since stripping and reprobing of the blots with 4F11 did not indicate a change in cortactin amounts over the course of the experiment ( representative cortactin blot shown in Fig . 6 A ) . Immunoblotting of lysates from stimulated NeoR1 cells at the same time points with antibodies against activated EGF receptor ( phospho EGFR ) and Src ( pY418 Src ) indicated that both enzymes attained rapid ( within 1 min ) and sustained activation over the course of the experiment ( Fig . 6 A ) . These data indicate that tyrosine 421 and 466 are phosphorylated in response to EGF treatment in NeoR1 cells with kinetics similar to that in other cell systems , and that the time course of cortactin tyrosine 421 and tyrosine 466 phosphorylation parallels the activation of both EGF receptor and Src . In addition to Src , EGF also activates Rac1 , which leads to cortical actin polymerization that results in the formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia ( Ridley , et al . , 1992 ; Bailly , et al . , 1999 ) . Since pY421 cortactin localizes to lamellipodia with cortical F - actin in cells cultured in serum ( Fig . 5 A , B ) the subcellular distribution of both cortactin and pY421 cortactin in NeoR1 cells was examined following EGF treatment ( Fig . 6 B ) . Serum starved NeoR1 cells ( 0 min ) were largely devoid of pY421 cortactin , with only faint labeling present in the cytoplasm where the majority of the cortactin pool was localized ( Fig . 6 B ) . Serum starved cells treated for 1 min with 20 ng / ml EGF demonstrated nearly exclusive labeling of pY421 cortactin within broad membrane ruffles , with very little staining of the perinuclear region in spite of the presence of abundant cytoplasmic cortactin ( Fig . 6 B ) . A similar pattern was observed after 5 min of EGF treatment , although the membrane ruffles containing cortactin and pY421 cortactin were 23 narrower ( Fig . 6 B ) , reminiscent of the phenotype exhibited by cells overexpressing activated Rac1 ( Fig . 2 B ) . By 30 min , the majority ( 60 % ) of cells were similar to the phenotype observed after 5 min of EGF stimulation . However , a significant number ( 34 % ) of cells exhibited a polarized phenotype indicative of motility , with a clearly defined leading and trailing edge . In these cells pY421 cortactin was enriched almost exclusively within leading edge lamellipodia as well as in the trailing edge , with little labeling of the cytoplasm despite the presence of an abundant cortactin pool in this region ( Fig . 6 B ) . These data indicate that pY421 cortactin selectively localizes to membrane ruffles and lamellipodia in response to EGF receptor activation . Phosphorylation of Cortactin Tyrosine 421 and Tyrosine 466 Requires Rac1 Activity Translocation of cortactin from the cytoplasm into membrane ruffles and lamellipodia requires Rac1 activity ( Weed , et al . , 1998 ) . Since pY421 cortactin was selectively localized to these regions as a result of EGF treatment in NeoR1 cells , we examined whether phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosine 421 and tyrosine 466 was regulated by the activation state of Rac1 . C3H 10T1 / 2 cells were cotransfected with FLAG - FL cortactin and with empty myc vector ( V ) , dominant negative myc - Rac1T17N ( N17 ) or constitutively active myc - Rac1Q61L ( L61 ) . FLAG - FL cortactin was immunoprecipitated with anti - FLAG resin , and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was assayed by immunoblotting with anti - pY421 and anti - pY466 antibodies . FLAG - FL cortactin was phosphorylated at basal levels on tyrosine 421 and tyrosine 466 when coexpressed with the myc vector . However , phosphorylation of FLAG - FL cortactin tyrosines 421 and 466 was inhibited when expressed with myc - Rac1N17 ( Fig . 7 A ) . Conversely , expression of myc - RacL61 enhanced FLAG - FL cortactin tyrosine 421 and 466 phosphorylation 24 compared to that of cells transfected with vector alone ( Fig . 7 A ) . Expression of myc - Rac proteins was verified by immunoblotting of cell lysates with an anti - Rac1 monoclonal antibody , which detects both endogenous Rac1 as well as the slower migrating myc - Rac1 proteins ( Fig . 7 A ) . These results indicate that the activity of Rac1 regulates phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosine 421 and 466 . To evaluate the subcellular distribution and degree of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in response Rac1 activity in vivo , C3H 10T1 / 2 cells transfected with empty myc vector ( vector ) , myc - Rac1N17 and myc - Rac1L61were trypsinized , plated onto fibronectin and allowed to spread for 2 h . Cells were immunostained with anti - pY421 cortactin and anti - myc 9E10 ( Fig . 7 B ) or anti - pY421 cortactin and anti - cortactin 4F11 ( Fig . 7 C ) . In cells transfected with myc vector , pY421 cortactin localized at the perinuclear region and within lamellipodia with endogenous cortactin ( Fig . 7 B , C ) as observed previously ( Fig . 5 A , B ) . Expression of myc - Rac1N17 inhibited the localization of cortactin to the cell periphery and resulted in the loss of pY421 immunolabeling from the cell cortex , and well as significantly reducing level of pY421 labeling in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 7 B , C ) . In contrast , myc - RacL61 expression resulted in the translocation of cortactin to the cell cortex ( Fig . 7 C ) along with increased pY421 cortactin immunolabeling that localized at both the cell periphery and the perinuclear region ( Fig . 7 B , C ) . These results suggest that Rac1 - induced translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery is required for phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosine 421 25 Discussion Previous work has established that tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 in murine cortactin as the central residues targeted by Src , Fer and c - Met kinases ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ; Kapus , et al . , 2000 ; Crostella , et al . , 2001 ) . While phosphorylation of these residues is required for efficient cell motility ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ; Crostella , et al . , 2001 ) , the spatial and temporal requirements for cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation were previously unknown . The results presented here demonstrate that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the carboxyl terminal cortactin domain requires the cortactin amino terminus . Site - specific antibodies against phosphotyrosine 421 and 466 , two sites of Src - mediated cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , demonstrate that both of these tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in response activation of Src , EGFR and Rac1 . Western blot analysis of cortactin point mutants indicates that tyrosine 421 phosphorylation is required for phosphorylation of tyrosine 466 . Cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine 421 is enriched in lamellipodia and podosomes where it colocalizes with cortical F - actin . Phosphorylation of tyrosine 421 and 466 is dependent on activation of Rac1 . Collectively , our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin requires Rac1 - mediated targeting to the cortical actin network within lamellipodia , where it is tyrosine phosphorylated at codons 421 and 466 in a hierarchical manner . We propose that phosphorylation of cortactin at tyrosine 421 and 466 serves to integrate tyrosine kinase based signals with signaling pathways that contribute to actin cytoskeletal assembly and lamellipodia formation . In agreement with previous results ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ) , expression of cortactin tyrosine point mutants in c - Src overexpressing cells indicates that tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 are phosphorylated in vivo as a result of Src activity , with tyrosine 421 as the primary site of phosphorylation . Although codons 421 , 466 and 482 are phosphorylated by Src , mutation of 26 these three sites to phenylalanine does not completely abolish cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . An additional tyrosine at codon 485 has been reported to be weakly phosphorylated by Src in vitro ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ) . Of the 27 tyrosine residues in murine cortactin , 12 are clustered within the carboxyl terminus ( Miglarese , et al . , 1994 ) with the remaining residues distributed throughout the amino terminus . Our analysis indicates that the amino terminal cortactin domain is tyrosine phosphorylated in a manner independent from Src and is phosphorylated at a low stoichiometry and / or at a single site . Tyrosine phosphorylation of the amino terminal domain is significantly enhanced following treatment of cells with several growth factors ( our unpublished results ) pointing to a potential physiological role . While the significance of this is currently unclear , one possibility is that tyrosine phosphorylation of the cortactin amino terminus may modulate its interaction with Arp2 / 3 complex and / or F - actin networks . The availability of phosphorylation site - specific antibodies against tyrosine 421 and 466 in murine cortactin allows for the specific analysis of these phosphorylation sites . Oncogenic transformation by v - Src results in increased cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Kanner , et al . , 1990 ; Wu , et al . , 1991 ) , and our results using site - specific antibodies indicates that tyrosines 421 and 466 are phosphorylated in v - Src transformed cells . Analysis of tyrosine point mutants with site - specific phosphorylation antibodies indicates that phosphorylation of tyrosine 421 is required for phosphorylation of tyrosine 466 ( Fig . 4 ) , a conclusion consistent the results shown in Figure 1 B using a general anti - phosphotyrosine antibody . The amino acid sequence distal to tyrosine 421 ( 421 YEDA 424 ) conforms to the consensus binding site for Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domains ( Songyan , et al . , 1993 ) and is conserved in all vertebrate cortactins identified to date ( Fig . 8 ) . Src coimmunoprecipitates with cortactin in multiple cell systems ( Zhan , et al . , 1994 ; Okamura and Resh , 1995 ; van Damme , et al . , 1997 ) , and the SH2 domain of Src can associate 27 with tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin ( Okamura and Resh , 1995 ) . Treatment of Csk - / - fibroblasts with the SH2 inhibitory compound AP22408 inhibits cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Violette , et al . , 2001 ) , pointing to a direct requirement for Src SH2 association with cortactin as a precursor event for cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . These results , taken together with our observations suggests that cortactin is phosphorylated by Src in a sequential manner involving initial phosphorylation of tyrosine 421 , potentially creating a binding site for the Src SH2 domain that would allow for Src association and subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine 466 . The involvement of tyrosine 482 in such a processive mechanism will require the development of phosphorylation specific antibodies against this site . Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation occurs concurrently with a multitude of signaling events that induce remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Weed and Parsons , 2001 and references therein ) . Our data herein suggest that the ability of cortactin to regulate the actin cytoskeleton is structurally coupled with phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the carboxyl terminus . The inability of the carboxyl terminal cortactin domain to become tyrosine phosphorylated when expressed alone suggests that localization and association with F - actin and / or Arp2 / 3 complex at the cell periphery mediated by the amino terminus is required for phosphorylation of this domain . The ability of coronin1 , a cortical actin and Arp2 / 3 complex binding protein implicated in lamellipodia formation ( Mishima and Nishida , 1999 ; Humphries , et al . , 2002 ) to rescue tyrosine phosphorylation of the cortactin carboxyl terminus supports a model whereby tyrosine phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus requires targeting of cortactin to and association with Arp2 / 3 complex and the cortical actin cytoskeleton , although the possibility exists that an actin - binding amino terminus ( from either cortactin or coronin1 ) is required for 28 proper conformational folding of the carboxyl terminus and subsequent recognition by Src and other tyrosine kinases in vivo . The enrichment of cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine 421 in lamellipodia and podosomes , dynamic sites of actin remodeling , supports a possible role for cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating actin dynamics . While the binding of cortactin to F - actin is not influenced by Src phosphorylation ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) , previous work has suggested that phosphorylation of Src by cortactin downregulates the ability of cortactin to bundle actin filaments ( Huang , et al . , 1997 ) , although other groups have not detected efficient bundling in the presence of cortactin ( Weaver , et al . , 2001 ) . Cortactin exists as a monomer ( Weaver , et al . , 2002 ) and possesses a single F - actin binding site ( Weed , et al . , 2000 ) , making the mechanism by which cortactin bundles F - actin unclear . Another possibility is that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin may influence the cortical actin cytoskeleton by creating binding sites for SH2 / SH3 adaptor molecules involved in actin remodeling . Tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin interacts with the SH2 domains of Nck and Crk ( Okamura and Resh , 1995 ) , two adaptor proteins that couple phosphotyrosine signals through interactions with their SH2 domains to Rac1 and Arp2 / 3 complex mediated actin reorganization by SH3 domain - mediated interactions ( reviewed in Li , et al . , 2001 ; Feller , 2001 ) . Phosphorylation of cortactin at tyrosine 421 and / or 466 may therefore serve as an indirect mechanism for regulating the cortical cytoskeleton in addition to the direct ability of the cortactin amino terminus to regulate Arp2 / 3 complex actin nucleation activity . In agreement with our findings , a recent report has suggested that Rac1 activation enhances cortactin translocation in cells exposed to hyperosmotic conditions ( Di Ciano , et al . , 2002 ) . This group reported that Rac1N17 inhibited cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in their system , although the level of inhibition of was not to the extent of that observed in our report . 29 This may be due to differences specific to hyperosmotic shock and the implicated kinase Fer ( Kapus , et al . , 2000 ) , which differs from the analysis preformed in our fibroblast system , as well as the phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues on cortactin that may not be regulated by the activation state of Rac1 . In addition to its association with the cortical actin cytoskeleton , cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine 421 was also present to a lesser extent within the cytoplasmic cortactin pool in motile and spreading cells ( Fig . 5 , A , B ) and this cytoplasmic distribution was enhanced in cells expressing Rac1 L61 ( Fig . 7 , B , C ) . DiCiano , et al ( 2002 ) speculate that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin may serve to stimulate the release of cortactin from Arp2 / 3 networks as a result of hyperosmolarity , and the presence of cytoplasmic cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine 421 in fibroblasts supports such a hypothesis . However , serum - starved cells treated with EGF , a potent Rac1 activator , led to the rapid and specific accumulation of cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine 421 at the cell cortex , with little phosphorylated cortactin present in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 6 , B ) . While our biochemical and localization data strongly suggest that Rac1 activation is the major determinant in the phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosine 421 and 466 in fibroblasts , the differential effects between EGF and serum in regulating the levels of cytoplasmic cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine 421 points to the potential participation of additional signaling pathways contributing to cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . In addition to their localization in lamellipodia , both cortactin and Src are present at significant levels in perinuclear vesicular compartments within the cytoplasm , where their distribution demonstrates a degree of overlap ( Maa , et al . , 1992 ; Okamura and Resh , 1995 ) . Previous work demonstrating the requirement for Rac1 activity in the translocation of cortactin and Src to lamellipodia ( Weed , et al . , 1998 ; Timpson , et al . , 2001 ) combined with the data 30 presented in this report suggests that a possible mechanism for Src - mediated cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation may involve Rac1 induced targeting of non - phosphorylated cortactin and Src from cytoplasmic compartments to the cortical actin cytoskeleton . This would allow for the compartmentalization of cortactin and Src in lamellipodia , where subsequent juxtaposition of cortactin to activated Src would result in the processive phosphorylation of cortactin on tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 . The requirement for phosphorylation of cortactin on these tyrosine residues in normal cell migration ( Huang , et al . , 1998 ; Crostella , et al . , 2001 ) and tumor cell metastasis ( Li , et al . , 2001 ) highlights the importance of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating normal and neoplastic cell movement . By controlling the subcellular localization of cortactin and Src , Rac1 may serve to integrate actin cytoskeletal signaling pathways through cortactin by regulating Arp2 / 3 complex activity with transmembrane receptor and non - receptor tyrosine phosphorylation pathways utilized during lamellipodia extension and subsequent cell motility . 31 Acknowledgements We thank Scott Lewis ( Biosource International ) for technical support , Andrew Kinley and Andrei Karginov ( University of Virginia ) for early assistance , Sarah Parsons and Mike Cox ( University of Virginia ) for helpful discussions , and the laboratory of Matt Thomas ( Washington University , St .
