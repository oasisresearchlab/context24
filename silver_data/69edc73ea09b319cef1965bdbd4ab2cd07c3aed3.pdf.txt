There is a need for a technique allowing studies of human mucosal specimens collected during different clinical conditions . This study elucidates if square wave pulse analysis discriminates between epithelial and transmural electrical resistance and if there is an association with transepithelial permeability of molecular probes . Methods . Mucosae from esophagus ( surgical resections : n = 14 ; endoscopic biopsies : n = 15 ) and jejunum ( n = 12 ) and Caco - 2 cell monolayers were investigated in Ussing chambers . Transmural and epithelial electrical resistance were recorded by the use of standardized current pulses . Permeability was assessed using two ﬂ uorescein - labeled probes ( weight 376 and 4000 Da ) . Results . Baseline epithelial electrical resistance was higher in esophageal mucosa ( ~ 280 W * cm 2 ) , than in jejunal ( ~ 10 W * cm 2 ) and Caco - 2 cells ( ~ 140 W * cm 2 ) . The subepithelial contribution to the transmural resistance was higher in jejunal preparations ( + 88 % ) and Caco - 2 cells ( + 75 % ) , than in esophageal ( + 30 % ) . During hypoxia the subepithelial resistance was unchanged , whereas the epithelial resistance decreased signi ﬁ cantly in jejunal mucosa and Caco - 2 cells . These ﬁ ndings coincided with increased transepithelial probe permeability and signs of disturbed morphology . Esophageal epithelia were resistant to hypoxia . However , exposure to deoxycholic acid and trypsin abolished the esophageal epithelial resistance and increased probe permeability . Endoscopic esophageal biopsies from patients with erosive re ﬂ ux disease exhibited signi ﬁ cantly lower epithelial resistance and higher current than healthy subjects . Conclusion . Square wave pulse analysis in Ussing chambers is suitable for assessment of epithelial electrical resistance that can re ﬂ ect transepithelial permeability of molecular probes with known size . Moreover , the technique discriminated between healthy and re ﬂ ux - diseased esophageal mucosal biopsies . Key Words : caco - 2 cells , epithelial electrical resistance , esophageal epithelium , jejunal epithelium , the Ussing pulse method , transmural electrical resistance Introduction Epithelial paracellular passage of potentially noxious agents has been proposed to play an important pathophysiological role in the initiation of a number of common gastrointestinal diseases , for example in gastroesophageal re ﬂ ux disease ( GERD ) [ 1 ] , in ﬂ am - matory bowel disease [ 2 , 3 ] and the metabolic syndrome [ 4 ] . Recent research has demonstrated tissue - speci ﬁ c composition of specialized proteins constituting the intercellular junctions , and also a linkage of these proteins to contractile elements of the cytoskeleton [ 5 ] . In order to be made useful in the context of clinical pathophysiology , it is essential that this new knowledge becomes con ﬁ rmed in human tissue and related to functionality . By necessity the availability of human mucosal samples are limited and particularly so with regard to certain patient cohorts . Ussing chamber experiments are attractive because they allow the use of endoscopic biopsies for Correspondence : Eleonora Björkman , Department of Gastrosurgical Research and Education , Institute of Clinical Sciences , Sahlgrenska Academy , University of Gothenburg , Bruna stråket 20 , S - 413 45 , Göteborg , Sweden .

Transepithelial electrical resistance , that by de ﬁ nition is reciprocal to electrical conduc - tivity ( G = 1 / R ) , assessed in Ussing chambers has long been used as a surrogate variable for paracellular transport capacity . The reason for this is because the transcellular resistance is much higher than the one existing between cells . Consequently , it is mainly the paracellular resistance that determines the total resistance of the tissue [ 5 ] . Furthermore , as electrical conductivity assumingly re ﬂ ects the intercellular tightness it also re ﬂ ects the paracellular permeability . However , the latter cannot be taken for granted because the electrical conductivity relates to the transport of small - sized ions of the tissue ﬂ uids and may be unrelated to the passage capacity of larger molecules . During clinical conditions , mucosal biopsy takings may reach different depths and therefore include various amounts of subepithelial structures making the additional resistance of this compartment quite unpredictable . The classical way of assessing tran - sepithelial resistance is based on Ohm ’ s law using the potential difference ( PD ) obtained when applying a known current across the mucosa ( the current clamp method ) . However , the ‘ transmural resistance ’ ( R trans ) obtained by current clamping cannot com - pensate for the resistance in the subepithelial tissue ( R subep ) . Impedance spectroscopy can be used to differentiate transmural from subepithelial resistance and , therefore , allows indirect estimation of the epithelial resistance [ 6 ] . Although this method allows detailed investigation of epithelial electrical characteristics , it is technically quite com - plicated [ 7 ] . In the present study , square wave current pulse analysis was used for directly asses - sing epithelial electrical resistance ( R ep ) in human gastrointestinal mucosae . This technique has been described in detail before [ 8 , 9 ] and for the sake of clarity it is designated as the Ussing pulse method ( UPM ; Stage , L . http : goto . glocalnet . net / medimet / ) . The aim of the present study was to elucidate if UPM discriminates epithelial and subepithelial resistance . Epithelia from human esophagus and jejunum , as well as Caco - 2 cell monolayers , all with different morphology and function , were investigated . Tests were performed during control conditions and when challenging the structural inte - grity and viability of the epithelium . A second aim was to investigate to what degree the UPM assessed epithelial electrical resistance re ﬂ ected the transe - pithelial permeability of molecular probes with known size . A third aim was to test if UPM is applicable also for small mucosal biopsies obtained during endoscopy . Methods Subjects and ethics Human mucosae from esophagus ( n = 14 , mean age 66 years , range 46 – 76 , 3 females ) and jejunum ( n = 12 , mean age 49 years , range 27 – 67 , 5 females ) were obtained from patients undergoing esophagect - omy for malignancy at the esophagogastric junction or Roux - en - Y Gastric Bypass for morbid obesity , respec - tively . The esophageal specimens were obtained from approximately 4 to 8 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter . Care was taken so that the resected tissue used in the experiment was collected as far as possible from any pathological area , that is neoplastic changes , and a normal histological appearance was con ﬁ rmed ( see below ) . Endoscopically acquired esophageal mucosal biopsies were obtained from both healthy volunteers ( = controls ; n = 7 , mean age 26 years , range 21 – 37 , 5 females ) and individuals with erosive re ﬂ ux disease ( ERD ; n = 8 , mean age 41 years , range 21 – 60 , 5 females ) . The enrolled ERD patients were scored to be Grade A according to the Los Angeles classi ﬁ - cation system for re ﬂ ux esophagitis . The patients were requested to abstain from medication with proton pump inhibitors for at least 2 weeks before endoscopy . The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Gothenburg as well as by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg . All subjects who participated in the study were informed verbally and in writing and signed a consent form . Cell culture Caco - 2 cells , a human epithelial colorectal adenocar - cinoma cell line ( passage no . 45 ; Sigma - Aldrich , Stockholm , Sweden ) , were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s Medium , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % non - essential amino acids and 100 IU / ml Penicillin – Streptomycin that was replaced every second day ( chemicals from Life Tech - nologies Invitrogen , Stockholm , Sweden ) [ 10 ] . The cells were incubated at 37 (cid:1) C in 5 % CO 2 and cultured in cell culture ﬂ asks ( BD Falcon (cid:3) 734 – 0010 , VWR Internationals , Stockholm , Sweden ) for approxi - mately 1 week before they were detached ( 0 . 25 % trypsin - EDTA , Life Technologies Invitrogen ) and seeded , 1 . 5 – 2 . 0 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / well , onto cell culture inserts ( Snapwell 1 . 12 cm 2 , 0 . 4 m m pore polyester membrane Corning (cid:3) Costar (cid:3) , Sigma - Aldrich ) . At con ﬂ uence , the culture medium was changed to FBS - free and to the lower compartment a mixture of 10 m l / ml insulin , 0 . 55 m g / ml transferrin and 1322 E . Björkman et al . 6 . 7 ng / ml selenium ( ITS 41400 – 045 , Life Technol - ogies Invitrogen ) was added to establish cell polarity and structural differentiation [ 11 ] . The cell mono - layers were cultivated for around 10 days prior to Ussing chamber experiments . Ussing chamber experiments Preparation and set up . The esophageal and jejunal tissues were immediately immersed in ice - cold oxygenated Krebs solution ( in mM : 118 NaCl , 4 . 7 KCl , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 1 . 2 MgSO 4 , 1 . 0 NaH 2 PO 4 , 25 NaHCO 3 and 11 glucose ) . The mucosa was gently dissected from the muscular layer and the samples mounted in vertical Ussing chambers with an opening of 0 . 29 cm 2 ( Navicyte vertical multi - channel Ussing chambers , Warner Instruments , Hamden , CT , USA ) . Depending on tissue availabi - lity , up to six Ussing chambers per individual were mounted . The detachable Caco - 2 cell culture inserts allowed direct mounting into the Ussing chambers ( EasyMount multichannel Ussing cham - bers P - 2300 series , Warner Instruments ) . Both the luminal and the serosal chamber side were bathed in 5 ml Krebs solution at 37 (cid:1) C and the solution was continuously oxygenated and stirred with a gas ﬂ ow of 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 . To be eligible for exper - imentation each preparation had to ful ﬁ ll certain viability criteria following a 15 min equilibration period . The criteria were based on previous experi - mental experiences and were for jejunal specimens set to a lumen negative PD of ‡ 3 mV and R ep of ‡ 6 W * cm 2 . The esophageal epithelium had to exhibit a negative PD of ‡ 1 mV , whereas the Caco - 2 cells had to have a lumen negative PD of ‡ 0 . 25 mV to become included in the experiment . Electrical recordings and calculations . All electrical recordings in the present study were collected using specially constructed ampli ﬁ ers connected to a com - puter with customized software developed in LabView ( National Instruments , Austin , TX , USA ) for online visualization , data storage and analysis ( Figure 1C ) . The different recordings were performed as following : ( 1 ) Transepithelial PD was continuously recorded using a pair of matched KCl - calomel electrodes ( REF401 , Radiometer Analytical , Copenhagen , Denmark ) connected to the Ussing chamber by NaCl - agar bridges . ( 2 ) Epithelial resistance ( R ep ) : The UPM is based on the conception of the epithelium behaving as a capacitor ( C ep ) and a resistor ( R ep ) coupled in parallel ( Figure 1A ) [ 12 ] . The capacitor represents the epithelial ability to store electrical charges and the resistor represents the epithelial leaking resistance determined mainly by the paracellular electrical conductance . By applying a short current pulse across the tissue the capac - itor will be charged . When the current ends , the retained charges of the epithelial capacitor will gradually be discharged through the epithelial resistor ( Figure 1B ) . The R ep is calculated by dividing the magnitude of the voltage de ﬂ ection ( Figure 1C ) with the magnitude of the applied current . It follows that the achieved resistance is constituted exclusively by epithelial resistance and independent of external resistances in the system . In order to optimize signal acquisition and analysis , the current pulse across the tissue was individualized for each specimen regarding amperage and duration ( range : 30 – 110 m A and 200 – 1000 m s ) . ( 3 ) Transmural resistance ( R trans ) was calculated from the magnitude of the current pulse and the produced net maximal voltage response by using Ohm ’ s law . Correction was made for the external resistance in the chamber ( in cablings , bath solutions , culture cup inserts , etc . ) , which was tested in the same way but without epithelial preparation . ( 4 ) Subepithelial resistance ( R subep ) was obtained by subtracting the epithelial resistance from the transmural resistance ( R trans - R ep = R subep ) . ( 5 ) The epithelial electrical current ( I ep ) was calculated from Ohm ’ s law by I = PD / R ep . ( 6 ) Epithelial capacitance ( C ep ) was assessed using the slope of the discharging curve . Transepithelial permeability . After a baseline period , either ﬂ uorescein sodium salt Mw - 376 ( FSS ) or ﬂ uorescein isothiocyanate - dextran Mw - 4000 ( FD4 ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to the luminal chamber side to a ﬁ nal concentration of 2 . 7 and 0 . 5 mM , respectively . Samples ( 200 m l ) from the serosal compartment were withdrawn at baseline and at 40 , 60 and 100 min and the concentration of each probe was spectrophotometrically assessed at excitation 480 nm and emission 535 nm ( TECAN , Salzburg , Austria ) . Probe permeability was expressed as the apparent permeability coef ﬁ cient ( P app ) according to the formula : P app = ( dc / dt ) ( V / ( AC 0 ) ) , where dc / dt is concentration change per time unit ( molar per second ) , V is serosal chamber volume ( cm 3 ) , A is exposed tissue area ( cm 2 ) and C 0 is initial probe concentration in the luminal compartment ( molar ) [ 13 , 14 ] . Due to initiation of tissue injury after 60 min ( see Results ) , P app for jejunal preparations was Epithelial resistance in human mucosae 1323 calculated for the period between 40 and 60 min , whereas the period 40 – 100 min was used for the better preserved esophageal epithelium and the Caco - 2 cell monolayers . Interventional procedures . Hypoxia : After the equilibra - tion and baseline period the gas composition was changed to 95 % N 2 and 5 % CO 2 in half of the chamber settings , whereas the rest acted as oxygenated time controls , corresponding to a nor - moxic situation in the Ussing chamber set up . Chemical aggression ( esophagus only ) : In a sepa - rate set of esophageal preparations , the epithelial integrity was challenged after baseline measurements by adding a combination of 0 . 04 mM trypsin ( bovine pancreas Type I , ~ 10 , 000 BAEE units mg / ml protein ) and 5 mM of the bile salt deoxycholic acid ( DCA ; Sigma - Aldrich ) to the luminal compartment .

Panel ( C ) displays the voltage decline ( corresponds to grey area in B ) as presented in the UPM analyzer program ( note the logarithmic scale on the y - axis ) .

Histology Samples of tissue specimens were ﬁ xed in neutral buffered 4 % formaldehyde , dehydrated , embedded in paraf ﬁ n , cut in 4 m m sections , mounted on slides and examined with white light microscopy by expe - rienced histologists blinded to the experimental protocol . Representative specimens from completed Ussing chamber experiments were examined with regard to epithelial thickness , surface area , edema , cell damage and amount of debris . Changes in surface area over experimental time were determined in a subset of jejunal preparations ( n = 4 , N = 14 ) by placing a ﬁ xed grid over the tissue and thereafter counting the intersections between gridlines and mucosal surface [ 15 ] . Endoscopically acquired mucosal specimens The usability of UPM in small biopsies obtained by a routine endoscopic procedure was tested on esophageal mucosae of healthy subjects and patients with ERD , outside their mucosal break area ( biopsies collected with forcep FB - 234U Olympus , Hamburg , Germany ) . These mucosal biopsies were mounted in vertical mini Ussing Chambers ( Warner Instru - ments ) containing a biopsy insert with a diameter of 1 . 5 mm resulting in the square area of 0 . 018 cm 2 . The biopsies were let to equilibrate for 30 min in the Ussing chambers before baseline measurements were performed over a period of 20 min . A lumen negative PD of at least 0 . 3 mV was set as an inclusion criterion to assure tissue viability . The Ussing chamber procedure was done in the same way as described above . Data analysis and statistics Comparisons of changes in the electrical para - meters were performed by Student ’ s t - test for paired or unpaired values when appropriate . Asso - ciations between R ep and P app were tested by Pearson correlation . Repeated measurements were taken into consideration , although no adjustment for the risk of mass - signi ﬁ cance was performed . Number of individuals was denoted by a ‘ n ’ and preparations by a ‘ N ’ and a p - value of £ 0 . 05 was considered signi ﬁ cant ( SPSS 18 . 0 , SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Results Electrical resistance characteristics in the three different types of epithelia As displayed in Table I , the UPM - based R ep differed considerably between the three studied epithelia with the esophageal exhibiting the highest value and the jejunal epithelium the lowest . As expected , the epithe - lial resistance was lower than the transmural tissue resistance in all settings . In the jejunal preparations and in the Caco - 2 cell layers , this difference was eight - and fourfold , respectively . The esophageal mucosal preparations demonstrated a more modest difference with UPM values being approximately 30 % lower than the resistance obtained from current clamping . The difference between the epithelial resistance as assessed with UPM and the transmural resistance was de ﬁ ned as the subepithelial resistance ( R subep ) and absolute values for each epithelium are given in Table I . Effects when challenging the epithelial viability Jejunal epithelium . The oxygenated jejunal prepara - tions had reasonably stable R ep over time ( Figure 2A ) , whereas both PD and I ep decreased gradually reach - ing approximately 50 % to 65 % of baseline after 60 min ( Figure 2C and D ) . Hypoxia induced a prompt reduction of both PD and I ep to levels of around 10 % of baseline after 60 min and thus signi ﬁ cantly below the values of corresponding time controls ( Figure 2C and D ) . Furthermore , the hypoxic procedure was followed by a R ep reduction of 30 – 45 % compared with controls ( Figure 2A ) , whereas the R subep was unchanged although somewhat Table I .

The oxygenated jejunal controls exhibited a normal histological appearance after the 100 min study period ( Figure 2E ) , not dif - fering considerably from corresponding unmounted tissue ( n = 7 , N = 14 ) . However , the specimens subjected to hypoxia displayed pronounced epithelial area loss after 100 min ( > 75 % ; Figure 2G ) and also minor after 60 min ( 13 % , Figure 2F ; n = 4 , N = 14 ) . Due to this hypoxia - induced structural derangement , the evaluation of transepithelial macromolecular permeability was limited to the period between 40 and 60 min . As expected , the permeability of the smaller FSS - probe was higher than that of the larger FD4 - probe ( Table II ) . Hypoxia was associated with higher permeability of both FSS and FD4 compared with oxygenated control preparations . Plotting data from the experiments revealed an inverse linear relationship between R ep and P app for FSS in jejunum ( R : - 0 . 61 and p : 0 . 009 ; Figure 2H ) . Also R trans was linearly related to P app for FSS ( R : - 0 . 56 and p : 0 . 019 ) , whereas R subep was not ( data not shown in ﬁ gure ) . Caco - 2 cell layer . During oxygenated control condi - tions , R ep as well as PD and I ep increased over time by 15 % to 20 % . Upon onset of hypoxia both PD and I ep decreased immediately to very low values , whereas R ep demonstrated a gradual decrease reaching 77 % of baseline after 100 min ( Figure 3A , C and D ) . Consequently , the hypoxia procedure reduced R ep by approximately 40 % when compared with the oxygenated time controls . This contrasted to R subep , which decreased slowly over time in all cell layers , independent on presence or absence of oxygen , to a level of around 87 % of baseline after 100 min ( Figure 3B ) . Histological evaluation displayed that oxygenated controls maintained normal cell shape , whereas Caco - 2 cells being subjected to hypoxia for 100 min displayed cell swelling although with an intact epithelial structure ( Figure 3E and F ; N = 6 ) . P app for FD4 was low in the oxygenated cell layers and signi ﬁ cantly higher in the hypoxia treated as shown in Table II . Furthermore , the permeability of FD4 showed an inverse linear relationship to R ep ( R : - 0 . 61 and p : 0 . 007 ; Figure 3G ) . FSS was not tested in the Caco - 2 cell layers due to previously reported non - linear ﬂ ux characteristics in this model [ 16 ] . Neither R trans nor R subep showed any linear relation to P app for FD4 ( data not shown in ﬁ gure ) . Esophageal epithelium . . In contrast to the jejunal epi - thelium and Caco - 2 cell layers , the R ep of the esoph - ageal epithelia was resistant to hypoxia ( Figure 4A ) , despite a pronounced reduction in the viability markers PD and I ep ( Figure 4C and D ) . The R subep and the permeability to both FSS and FD4 were in principal also unaffected by hypoxia ( Figure 4B , Table II ) . Microscopic examination did not reveal any signi ﬁ cant alterations in epithelial thickness or cellular morphology ( Figure 4E ) , although cell swell - ing was observed in a few specimens ( n = 7 , N = 17 ) . Since hypoxia did not signi ﬁ cantly alter R ep or chan - ged the histological appearance of the esophageal epithelia , an additional set of experiments was per - formed using combined exposure of the bile acid DCA ( 5 mM ) and the protease trypsin ( 0 . 04 mM ) to the apical side of the epithelium . During the ﬁ rst 10 min the PD and I ep rapidly increased in most preparations , where after both variables signi ﬁ cantly decreased to below baseline and almost became abol - ished as shown in Figure 4H ( I ep is not shown in ﬁ gure ) . In contrast to PD and I ep , the esophageal R ep started to decrease immediately upon exposure of DCA and trypsin and had at the end of the experiment decreased by 95 % compared with controls ( Figure 4F ) . The luminal aggressors did not statisti - cally alter the R subep , although a trend toward a decrease was observed . Microscopic examination revealed that exposure to DCA and trypsin induced cell swelling and occasionally shedding of apical cell layers ( Figure 4J , n = 7 , N = 14 ) . No difference of the intercellular spaces was observed when compared with control . Moreover , the aggressors induced clumping of chromatin centrally in the nuclei . As mentioned above , the hypoxic procedure did not alter FSS probe transport making the procedure insuf ﬁ cient for concluding the presence of a potential linear relationship to epithelial electrical resistance . However , in the specimens that were exposed to DCA and trypsin FSS permeability was markedly high and associated with low R ep values ( Table II , Figure 4I ) . The non - linear relation between P app - FSS and R ep becomes well illustrated when plotting all esophageal preparations in a single diagram ( Figure 4I ) . Electrical characteristics of ERD mucosae Interestingly , the epithelial electrical resistance was lower , while the ion currents were higher in ERD patients compared with healthy subjects ( Table III ) . Endoscopical biopsies from healthy volunteers mounted in the mini Ussing chambers presented considerably lower PD and R ep as compared with resected esophageal mucosae in conventional Ussing chambers ( Tables I and III ) .

The measurement principle was tested in conventional Ussing chambers using surgically resected mucosae and cultured intestinal cell layers , and the usability was con ﬁ rmed on smaller biopsies obtained from routine clinical endoscopy . UPM is based on a simpli ﬁ ed model where the electrical characteristics of the epithelium constitute a resistor , a capacitor and a current generator coupled in par - allel . The capacitance originates mainly from the cell membrane ’ s property of becoming polarized when positioned in an electrical ﬁ eld , as induced for exam - ple by a short - lasting transmural square wave current pulse [ 17 ] . Upon cessation of the current pulse , the rate of depolarization is dependent exclusively on the epithelial resistance allowing estimation of the epithe - lial electrical resistance ( R ep ) without any need of corrections [ 8 , 9 ] . Consistent with this theory , all three investigated mucosal types exhibited an epithelial resistance lower than that obtained by conventional transmural current clamping ( R trans ) . Furthermore , the R ep of the esophageal preparations was much higher compared with the jejunal ones and the Caco - 2 cell layers . This can partly be due to the fact that the layers of the squamous esophageal epithelium can be regarded as resistors coupled in series , thus adding to the total epithelial resistance . The Caco - 2 cells and the jejunal epithelium , on the other hand , are constituted of only one layer of cells and , as con ﬁ rmed in the present study , do not exert as much electrical resistance . The low subepithelial resistance ( R trans minus R ep ) of the human esophageal and jejunal samples was an expected ﬁ nding because the subepithelial compart - ments consist largely of a rather loose matrix of cells and connective elements . However , the R trans of the Caco - 2 cell layers was fourfold higher than the UPM assessed epithelial resistance ( mean values : 568 vs . 143 W * cm 2 ) . This was a surprisingly large difference considering the relatively tenuous structure of the subepithelial compartment of the cultured cell layers . Human intestinal Caco - 2 cell layers mounted in Ussing - type chambers are widely used as models for epithelial transport processes [ 18 , 19 ] . R trans of these preparations are reported to be in the order of several hundreds of W * cm 2 ( refer to [ 10 , 20 , 21 ] ) . Although technical limitations cannot be completely excluded , the present estimation of a modest R ep in the Caco - 2 cell layer is supported by previously published data obtained by impedance spectroscopy . Krug et al . showed that epithelial conductance of Caco - 2 cells was approximately 6 ms / cm 2 [ 16 ] which corresponds to a R ep of 167 W * cm 2 , thus close to the value obtained with UPM in this study ( Table I ) . Taken together these data indicate that the electrical resistance of the subepithelial extra - cellular ﬁ lter matrix is very high . Future studies are needed to con ﬁ rm this observation and also to eluci - date potential mechanisms , for example related to cell - clone line , growth duration and conditions as well as on adaptation to different cell - supporting materials [ 10 , 22 , 23 ] . The electrical resistance of an epithelial lining is mainly due to the paracellular conductivity , whereas the transcellular conductivity is small [ 5 ] . The para - cellular conductivity is determined mainly by two factors : the state of the intercellular junctional com - plexes and the dimension ( length and width ) of the intercellular spaces . It is intuitive that the multi - layered squamous esophageal epithelium has a more ‘ labyrinthic ’ organization of its intercellular spaces than a single columnar cell - lined epithelium and consequently the esophageal paracellular permeability is markedly restricted . The junctional complexes are located at the lateral surface of the epithelial cells and are , depending on their structural appearance , subdivided into tight junctions , mainly made up of occludin and various claudins ; the adherence junctions involving , for example E - cadherin and the desmosomes consisting of proteins like desmoglein and desmoco - llin .

Hence , the paracellular conductivity depends on the type of junction and cytoskeletal proteins being expressed , and also on their conformational state . Both the intercellular junction proteins and the reactive cytoskeleton are at least partly oxygen - dependent [ 24 – 26 ] and the hypoxic procedure used in the present study ( without any reoxygenation ) was expected to reduce the intercellular adherence , thereby increasing paracellular conductivity . The most convincing observation of that UPM exclusively measures the resistance of the epithelial compartment was obtained when exposing the jejunal epithelia to long - lasting hypoxia . Jejunal enterocytes are very oxygen - dependent and 100 min of hypoxia destroyed large sections ( > 75 % ) of the jejunal epithe - lium . In this situation , R ep was concomitantly reduced by about 60 % whereas the R subep , re ﬂ ecting the hypoxia - resistant basal membrane and lamina pro - pria , was relatively constant . Furthermore , during hypoxic conditions where the cellular morphology was distorted ( mainly cell swelling ) but where the epithelial structure still remained intact , both jejunal specimens ( i . e . up to 60 min ) and Caco - 2 cell layers demonstrated a maintained R subep while a clear - cut reduction was observed for R ep .

Björkman et al . permeability to well - known molecular probes , with a preferably paracellular route , increased in association with the reduced R ep . This ﬁ nding supports that epithelial resistance not only re ﬂ ects the electrical conductivity of small charged molecules , but also the transepithelial passage of larger molecules . However , despite marked reductions in both PD and I ep , con ﬁ rming interfered cellular viability , the esophageal R ep was unchanged during hypoxia . The reason for this could be due to that the hypoxic procedure induced cell swelling that in turn reduced the intercellular spaces and counteracted a potential decrease in intercellular junctional resistance . In addi - tion , the permeability of the two molecular probes was markedly low and the FSS permeability did not change until the epithelial integrity was challenged with bile acid and trypsin , which also signi ﬁ cantly affected the epithelial resistance , con ﬁ rming data from a similar experiment performed in rabbit esoph - agus [ 27 ] . The pronounced R ep effect could be due to the intercellular E - cadherins being sensitive to DCA , which has been shown in a recent study [ 28 ] , making this bile acid of interest regarding epithelial integrity . Furthermore , re ﬂ uxed bile acids and proteolytic enzymes are involved in mucosal injuries occurring in relation to GERD by in ﬂ uencing tissue resistance and permeability [ 29 – 32 ] . In that respect , the exper - imental challenge of the esophageal epithelial integrity using bile acids and trypsin has pathophysiological relevance and may be an attractive model in mecha - nistic research . However , it should be noted that the concentration DCA used in the present tests was high and in future studies both the concentration and the bile acid pro ﬁ le should be adjusted to resemble the re ﬂ uxate occurring in GERD patients . Direct assessment of epithelial electrical resistance has several advantages . In addition to the evident association with paracellular conductivity , it mini - mizes the risk for underestimating ion currents as compared with the more commonly used short circuit current technique [ 8 , 9 ] . Furthermore , clinical applicability also appears possible . For example , epithelial resistance has been shown to be more sen - sitive than transmural resistance for indicating pres - ence of colonic mucosal in ﬂ ammation [ 7 ] . In the literature , there are so far very few studies on human small intestinal and esophageal epithelial resistance [ 8 , 33 – 35 ] . The R ep of adult human jejunum in the present study was lower than reported previously in children when using impedance spectroscopy ( » 20 W * cm 2 ) [ 34 ] . This may be due to different age of the study subjects , but also to that the mucosae in the present study were acquired from obese patients that probably have increased mucosal per - meability [ 4 ] . Transmural impedance spectroscopy also utilizes the fact that the epithelium has capacitor characteristics but uses alternating currents at differ - ent frequencies to perform an impedance analysis allowing subepithelial resistance as well as transmural resistance to be separately assessed , whereafter epi - thelial resistance can be estimated by subtraction [ 6 , 36 ] . This elegant technique can also be combined with measures ( e . g . scavenging Ca 2 + and ﬂ ux mea - surements ) that allow division into transcellular and paracellular resistances of the epithelium [ 7 ] . The UPM - technique should be possible to combine with similar re ﬁ ned methods . Hence , transmural impedance analysis allows a detailed investigation of the bioelectrical properties but demand an advanced data - analysis algorithm and a complex tech - nical set - up , including adaptation of the Ussing cham - ber . The UPM , on the other hand , is a simple technique to handle and perform measurements with high time resolution , making it clinically appli - cable in vitro examining , for example endoscopical biopsies of various physiological conditions . Indeed , in a separate set of experiments UPM applied on a mini Ussing set up , using mucosal biopsies obtained during esophagoscopy , discriminated between healthy mucosa and mucosa from patients with ERD . Compared with epithelia from healthy subjects , the samples from patients with re ﬂ ux disease exhib - ited an increased epithelial current and a reduced resistance . This is interesting from a pathophysiolog - ical point of view and indicates epithelial disease in patients with ERD as previously suggested by Jovov et al . [ 37 ] . Hence , as endoscopy is a routine procedure and permits abundant mucosal biopsy takings the use of UPM in mini Ussing chambers may considerably facilitate future studies of Table III .

Epithelial resistance in human mucosae 1331 mechanisms related to various gastrointestinal dis - eases . It should be noted that the absolute values of PD and R ep in the present study differed between esophageal epithelia mounted in the conventional set up and in the mini Ussing chamber . Technical rea - sons could be the relatively larger risk for edge leaks and edge damages related to the small biopsies in the mini Ussing set up . Another reasonable explanation is that the examined epithelia originated from patient populations with different disease - associated mucosal electrical characteristics , that is patients with mucosal malignant disease with a likely history of gastroesoph - ageal re ﬂ ux , patients with benignant ERD and healthy subjects . When taken together the present evaluation supports that UPM allows direct assessment of epithelial resistance ( conductance ) omitting the subepithelial compartment . Furthermore , when performed during validated circumstances UPM - assessed R ep also re ﬂ ects the transepithelial molecular permeability . In addition , UPM can be used in mini Ussing chambers allowing for examination of samples acquired during clinical routine endoscopy . The latter increases the clinical applicability of the technique as exampled in the present study by demonstrating signi ﬁ cant differences in electrical behavior between esophageal mucosae from healthy subjects and patients with ERD .
