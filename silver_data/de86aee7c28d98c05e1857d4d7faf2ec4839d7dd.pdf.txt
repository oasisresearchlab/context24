To achieve this goal , minimizing the background signal originating from nontarget tissues is crucial . Here we achieve highly speciﬁc in vivo cancer visualization by using a newly designed targeted ‘activatable’ ﬂuorescent imaging probe . This agent is activated after cellular internalization by sensing the pH change in the lysosome . Novel acidic pH – activatable probes based on the boron - dipyrromethene ﬂuorophore were synthesized and then conjugated to a cancer - targeting monoclonal antibody . As proof of concept , ex vivo and in vivo imaging of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 – positive lung cancer cells in mice was performed . The probe was highly speciﬁc for tumors with minimal background signal . Furthermore , because the acidic pH in lysosomes is maintained by the energy - consuming proton pump , only viable cancer cells were successfully visualized . The design concept can be widely adapted to cancer - speciﬁc , cell surface – targeting molecules that result in cellular internalization . Genetic cell labeling techniques show the possibility of detecting or tracing a single cell in vivo 1 – 3 ; however , currently available injectable molecular imaging probes are limited in their ability to detect small volumes of viable cancer because of low target - to - background ratios . Generally , small molecular probes lack speciﬁcity and have low target accumulation ; in contrast , larger molecules shows prolonged high retention and background 4 . However , such large - molecule complexes are cleared slowly , and thus a considerable amount of unbound probe remains . These pharmacokinetic characteristics result in high back - ground signal ( Fig . 1a ) . To overcome this problem , we developed an activatable ﬂuorescence probe consisting of a cancer - targeting macromolecule and a small - molecule ﬂuorescent moiety activated only within cancer cells to minimize the background signal and maximize the tumor - to - normal tissue ( T / N ) ratio ( Fig . 1b ) . We targeted the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( HER2 ) with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab , which , after binding to HER2 , is internalized via the endosomal - lysosomal degra - dation pathway 5 . The lysosome is distinct from other cellular organelles because of its low pH ( pH 5 . 0 – 6 . 0 ) relative to the cytoplasm ( pH B 7 . 4 ) . By designing a probe that becomes activated in an acidic environment , the agent yields a highly tumor - speciﬁc signal with greatly reduced background signal ( Fig . 1c ) . RESULTSDevelopment of a tunable , pH - activatable ﬂuorescent moiety To achieve signal activation within the acidic environment of the lysosome , we looked for small - molecule ﬂuorescent molecules with the following characteristics : ( i ) they should be almost nonﬂuorescent in the extracellular environment , that is , at pH 7 . 4 ; ( ii ) they should become highly ﬂuorescent under acidic conditions , that is , pH o 6 ; ( iii ) they need to be excited by long - wavelength light ( Z 500 nm ) and emit a ﬂuorescent signal that overcomes autoﬂuorescence ; ( iv ) they must covalently bind the targeting ligand or antibody ; and ( v ) they must be tunable to different acid dissociation constant ( p K a ) values for maximizing the T / N ratio . For developing probes , we employed the concept of photoinduced electron transfer ( PeT ) . Brieﬂy , if a chemical substrate reacts speciﬁcally with the target analyte and if its highest occupied molecular orbital or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level changes markedly upon reaction , a ﬂuorescence probe can be developed for the analyte by conjugating the substrate with an appropriate ﬂuorophore 6 – 9 . To develop a series of acidic pH – sensitive ﬂuorescence probes suitable to tag proteins , we selected anilines as the reactive moiety toward protons and a 2 , 6 - dicarboxyethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 - tetramethyl Received 24 April ; accepted 7 July ; published online 7 December 2008 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nm . 1854 1 Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , The University of Tokyo , 7 - 3 - 1 Hongo , Bunkyo , Tokyo 113 - 0033 , Japan . 2 PRESTO , Japan Science and Technology Agency , 3 - 5 Sanbancho , Chiyoda , Tokyo 102 - 0075 , Japan . 3 Molecular Imaging Program , Center for Cancer Research , National Cancer Institute , US National Institutes of Health , Building 10 , Room 1B40 , Mail Stop Code 1088 , 10 Center Drive , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 - 1088 , USA . 4 Molecular Diagnostic Technology Group , Advanced Core Technology Department , Research and Development Division , Olympus Corporation , 2 - 3 Kuboyama - cho , Hachioji , Tokyo 192 - 8512 , Japan . 5 Present addresses : Department of Radiology , National Defense Medical College , 3 - 2 Namiki , Tokorozawa , Saitama 359 - 8513 , Japan ( Y .

BODIPYs are well known to show strong emission of wavelengths over 500 nm , and their ﬂuorescence is unaffected by solvent polarity and pH . Furthermore , 2 , 6 - dicarboxyethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 - tetramethyl - BODIPY has two carboxylic groups that can be used for coupling to proteins . N , N - dialkylated anilines have sufﬁciently high highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels to cause PeT toward the BODIPY ﬂuorophore , and substitution of the N - alkyl group causes a p K a shift , so that it should be possible to develop a series of p K a - tunable compounds . On the basis of these strategies , we developed a series of unique , acidic pH – sensitive ﬂuorescence probes bearing various anilines at the C8 position of the BODIPY ﬂuorophore ( Supplementary Methods online ) . These com - pounds were almost nonﬂuorescent ( ﬂuorescence quantum yield ( F ﬂ ) o 0 . 002 ) in the nonprotonated form , owing to PeT from the aniline moiety to the ﬂuorophore , but became highly ﬂuorescent ( F ﬂ ¼ 0 . 55 – 0 . 60 ) in the protonated form , showing a greater than 300 - fold increase in emission ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Table 1 online ) . Figure 2b shows the pH - dependent changes in emission intensity of acidic pH - sensitive probes , as well as the constant emission from pH - independent , ‘always - on’ BODIPY bearing benzene instead of aniline . The p K a values differed depending on the alkyl group on the nitrogen , ranging from 3 . 8 to 6 . 0 ( Fig . 2c ) . Next , we conjugated these ﬂuorescence probes to trastuzumab by using their mono - N - hydroxy - succinimidyl ( NHS ) ester derivatives to form an amide bond with lysine residues of the antibody . We selected conjugates with a degree of labeling ( DOL ) of 2 . 7 – 3 . 0 as optimal and evaluated their pH - dependent ﬂuorescence emission intensity . The resulting probe - antibody conjugates produced acid - sensitive , reversible ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Movie 1 online ) . The p K a values were 4 . 4 , 4 . 9 and 5 . 8 for N , N - dimethylaminophenyl BODIPY ( DiMeN - BDP ) - , N - ethyl - N - methylaminophenyl BODIPY ( EtMeN - BDP ) - and N , N - diethylaminophenyl BODIPY ( DiEtN - BDP ) - trastuzumab , respectively—almost identical to the values of the free probes .

Fluorescence was conﬁned to the plasma membrane on the image obtained immediately after addition of the always - on control probe ( Fig . 3a ) . After more than 2 h , small bright spots appeared inside the cells , prob - ably corresponding to endosomal uptake of the probe ( Fig . 3a ) . These results indicate that the control probe shows strong ﬂuorescence , regardless of its cellular location . In contrast , almost no ﬂuorescence was observed immediately after the addition of the pH - activatable probes ( Fig . 3a ) . Because all probes were initially outside of the cells at neutral pH , the probe was still almost non - ﬂuorescent . After 2 h , however , the probe conjugates were partially internalized by endocytosis , leading to the formation of endosomes . In the case of DiEtN - BDP – trastuzumab , some ﬂuorescent spots were observed within the cells , but not on the plasma membrane , presumably reﬂecting the lowered pH inside the endo - somes ( Fig . 3a ) . However , DiMeN - BDP – trastuzumab and EtMeN - BDP – trastuzumab produced few ﬂuorescent spots inside the cells , D i E t N B D P E t M e N B D P D i M e N B D P p H - a c t i v a t ab l e p r obe s P h B D P A l w a ys on 20 µ m 0 h 0 h 0 h 0 h 2 h 2 h 2 h 2 h 4 h 4 h 4 h 4 h 24 h 24 h 24 h 24 h a b D i E t N B D P P h B D P Transmitted BODIPY LysoTracker Merge 20 µ m A l w a ys on p H - a c t i v a t ab l e p r obe Figure 3 In vitro imaging of NIH3T3 HER2 + cells with Ph - BDP – , DiMeN - BDP – , EtMeN - BDP – or DiEtN - BDP – labeled trastuzumab .

After 4 h , all activatable probes showed strongly ﬂuorescent spots that co - localized with LysoTracker dyes within the cells ( Fig . 3b ) , and this activation lasted at least 1 d . These results show pH - dependent activation of the probe conjugates , and only the cells that internalized these probes became ﬂuorescent , whereas the background ﬂuorescence was minimal . Among a series of activatable probes , DiEtN - BDP - probe showed stronger signal than did DiMeN - BDP - and EtMeN - BDP - probes , and so we selected DiEtN - BDP – transtuzumab as a pH - activatable agent for further in vivo tumor imaging experiments . In vivo imaging of HER2 - positive lung metastases To examine the potential of our approach for in vivo imaging , we performed in situ and ex vivo spectrally resolved ﬂuorescence imaging of freshly resected lungs bearing metastatic genetically engineered NIH3T3 mouse ﬁbroblast tumors overexpressing HER2 receptors with an always - on control probe and a pH - activatable probe . The control probe produced signals from non – tumor - bearing lung tissue and the heart , whereas the pH - activatable agent only produced signals from HER2 - positive tumors , and the background ﬂuorescence was suppressed ( Fig . 4a ) . As a result , the tumor - to - heart ratio of the pH - activatable probe ( DiEtN - BDP – trastuzumab ) , which was calculated with 28 tumors of B 1 mm in diameter ( 254 ± 5 pixels ) , was 22 - fold higher than that of the control probe ( 193 . 0 versus 8 . 7 arbitrary units , Supplementary Table 2 online ) . To conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of this pH - activatable probe , we used a mixed metastatic lung tumor model of the HER2 + red ﬂuorescent protein ( RFP ) – tumor cells and a HER2 – cell line with constitutively expressed RFP ( RFP + HER2 – ) . The pH - activatable agent pro - duced ﬂuorescence only in HER2 + RFP – tumors and not in RFP + HER2 – tumors ( Fig . 4b ) . In contrast , the control agent produced ﬂuorescence not only in HER2 + RFP – tumors , but also in the surrounding tissues ( Fig . 4b ) . Additionally , the control agent produced yellow ﬂuorescence in the control RFP + HER2 – tumors , owing to the mixing of red and green probes in the blood pool and interstitium . Sensitivity and speciﬁcity determinations were made on the basis of evaluation of 22 mice with 940 tumors ( 468 and 472 with control and pH - activatable probes , respectively ) with a size range between 0 . 5 mm and 2 . 0 mm . Comparison was made between the RFP + HER2 – cell line and the BODIPY - based probe ( green ) targeting the HER2 + RFP – cell line . On green or red ﬂuorescence unmixed images , all 940 tumors were visible with the green , the red or both ﬂuorescent signals ( sensitivity 100 % for both probes ) . Forty - eight of 468 tumors exam - ined in mice with the control probe and three tumors of 472 tumors examined in mice with the pH - activatable probe showed both green and red ﬂorescence ( the speciﬁcity was 84 . 8 % and 99 . 1 % for control and pH - activatable probes , respectively ; see also Supplementary Table 3 online ) . In addition , a control humanized antibody , pH - activatable dacli - zumab speciﬁc for the human interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) receptor a sub - unit 11 , which has 4 98 % sequential homology to trastuzumab , did not show any ﬂuorescence from the tumors ( Fig . 4c ) . To show that pH - activatable probes produce ﬂuorescence only from living cells , we loaded cells or tumors with either control or pH - activatable agent and then treated them with alcohol . Under ﬂuores - cence microscopy , the signal from pH - activatable probe – loaded cells disappeared immediately after addition of 30 % ethanol , whereas the 104 160 109 193 108 243 291 774 20 µ m 104 160 109 193 108 243 291 774 30 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol treatment a b c 1 mm 1 mm Pre - ethanol 30 min after ethanol Always on pH activatable 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 Always on ( n = 25 ) pH activatable ( n = 21 ) P < 0 . 001 ( Tumor size = 1 . 0 ± 0 . 3 mm in white light images ) 1 . 01 ± 0 . 32 0 . 32 ± 0 . 13 R e l a t i v e c hange s o f f l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y be f o r e v e r s u s 30 m i n a ft e r e t hano l t r ea t m en t D i E t N B D P E t M e N B D P D i M e N B D P p H - a c t i v a t ab l e p r obe s P h B D P A l w a ys on Figure 5 The activatable probe can produce a ﬂuorescence signal only from living HER2 - positive cells and tumors and not from dead cells or ﬁxed tumors .

Moreover , the signal in tumors , visualized with the pH - activatable agent , signiﬁcantly decreased 30 min after the tissues were dipped in ethanol ( P o 0 . 001 ) , whereas the signal in tumors visualized with the control agent showed minimal change ( Fig . 5b , c ) . The ﬁndings indicate that the signal from pH - activatable probes reﬂects cell viability . To show the versatility of the method , we targeted mice reperesent - ing a peritoneal metastasis model of ovarian cancer with galacto - samine - conjugated serum albumin ( GSA ) conjugated to the pH - activatable BODIPY . The in vitro and in vivo studies for detection and therapeutic monitoring of micrometastasis performed with the HER2 – targeted probe in the lung metastasis model were repeated for the ovarian cancer model ( Supplementary Figs . 1 – 4 online ) . As we have shown in the HER2 - overexpressing lung metastasis model , GSA - based target - speciﬁc pH - activatable probe against ovarian cancer achieved highly speciﬁc detection of peritoneal micrometastasis with minimal background ﬂuorescence signal and successful real - time monitoring of anticancer therapeutic effects by decreasing ﬂuores - cence signal over time . Furthermore , in vivo ﬂuorescence microendo - scopic experiments in live mice bearing peritoneal ovarian cancer micrometastases were performed to show that the method is amenable to a laparoscopic approach ( Supplementary Movies 2 – 4 online ) . Micrometastatic nodules invisible in regular white light endoscopic images were clearly detected with minimal background signal in ﬂuorescence - guided endoscopic images enhanced with a GSA - based pH - activatable probe that facilitated the performance of endoscopic surgery and enabled validation of the resected tumors . DISCUSSION Fluorescence - based probes have the advantage that their signal is potentially switchable depending on local conditions and are now commonly used for visualizing cellular processes 12 . Nevertheless , few activatable ﬂuorescence probes exist for in vivo imaging . Another group has developed activatable cyanine - based ﬂuorescence probes based on cathepsin - mediated dequenching , resulting in a 12 - fold increase in signal 13 , 14 . Our approach differs in that a macromolecule is used to target the probe , and activation occurs after internalization in the low pH environment of the lysosome . The ﬂuorescence yield is higher and the process is reversible . A few pH - sensitive ﬂuorescence probes are commercially available ; however , most are poorly suited to in vivo imaging because they become activated with increasing pH 15 . Others become activated under acidic conditions , but their wavelengths are too short 16 , they are too hydrophobic and lack a tagging moiety for conjugation 17 or their background signal under neutral pH conditions is relatively high 18 . The probes described here are almost nonﬂuorescent at neutral pH and highly ﬂuorescent at acidic pH . This high sensitivity , com - bined with high - speciﬁcity targeting , allows for the selective detection and monitoring of viable cancer cells in vivo . Another advantage of our probe is that its activation is reversible , which enables the probe to produce signal only in viable cancer cells . Unlike previously reported irreversible activatable probes , our pH - activatable probes will lose signal upon leakage from the cell , as occurs with cell damage or death . Therefore , this method potentially permits real - time monitoring of therapy on living cancer cells 19 . In addition , this method could be useful to monitor the intracellular kinetics of receptor - ligand complexes . Unlike other activatable probes 13 , 20 , 21 , DiEtN - BDP – trastuzumab consists of two independently functioning components : a targeted macromolecule ( monoclonal antibody or GSA ) and a pH - sensitive small - molecule ﬂuorescence probe that is tunable and activatable . Therefore , this method could employ any antibody or cytokine that is internalized after receptor binding . In addition , not only can the pH threshold of the ﬂuorescence be precisely tuned , but also the color ( emission wavelength ) can be changed by choosing different ﬂuor - ophores , such as rhodamines 22 ( Supplementary Movie 5 online ) . Trastuzumab has a high binding afﬁnity for the cell surface marker HER2 / neu ( erbB2 or p185 ) 23 and , therefore , could be potentially useful in HER2 - expressing metastases 24 , 25 . After forming homodi - mers , receptor - bound trastuzumab migrates to the lysosome as early as 45 min after binding 5 ; however , the internalization rate is B 4 % of bound antibody per hour 26 . Therefore , the use of more rapidly internalizing receptor - ligand systems , including the D - galactose recep - tor system 20 , 27 ( Supplementary Figs . 1 – 4 ) , could yield more intense and earlier ﬂuorescence signal . This agent could be adapted for clinical use with endoscopy or laparoscopy 28 and is potentially useful as an aid to surgery to improve the completeness of resection 29 . In conclusion , we have developed small - molecule , pH - activatable ﬂuorescence probes and have targeted them to viable cancer cells using macromolecule conjugates . These probe conjugates can potentially be used as in vitro tools for evaluating intracellular receptor kinetics , cell viability and real - time monitoring of cell death , although their main potential application will be as a clinical tool for cancer detection and real - time monitoring of therapy . METHODS Materials . General chemicals were of the best grade available , supplied by Aldrich Chemical , Tokyo Chemical Industries and Kokusan Chemical Works . Antibodies . We purchased trastuzumab , a US Food and Drug Administration – approved humanized monoclonal antibody to HER - 2 , which has a compli - mentarity - determination region against an epitope of HER - 2 grafted onto a human IgG 1 framework , from Genentech ( Herceptin ) . We purchased daclizu - mab , a US Food and Drug Administration – approved humanized monoclonal antibody to human CD25 ( IL - 2 receptor a subunit , IL - 2R a ( Tac ) ) , which has a complimentarity determination region against an epitope of CD25 grafted onto a human IgG 1 framework , from Hoffmann - La Roche ( Zenapax ) . Instruments . We recorded nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectra on a JEOL JNM - LA300 instrument at 300 MHz for 1 H - NMR and 75 MHz for 13 C - NMR . We measured mass spectra with a JEOL JMS - T100LC AccuToF . We obtained ultraviolet - visible spectra on a JASCO V - 550 . We performed ﬂuores - cence spectroscopic studies on a JASCO FP - 6500 . High - performance liquid chromatography . We performed preparative HPLC on a system composed of a pump ( PU - 2080 , JASCO ) and a detector ( MD - 2015 , JASCO ) with an Inertsil ODS - 3 ( 10 . 0 mm (cid:1) 250 mm ) column ( GL Sciences ) . Fluorometric analysis . The slit width was 3 nm for emission . The photo - multiplier voltage was 300 V . We obtained the relative ﬂuorescence quantum efﬁciency of BODIPY derivatives by comparing the area under the emission spectrum of the test sample excited at 490 nm with that of a solution of ﬂuorescein in 0 . 1 N NaOH , which has a quantum efﬁciency of 0 . 850 according to the literature 30 . Cell culture . We grew NIH3T3 HER2 + and Balb3T3 HER2 – RFP + cell lines 31 in RPMI 1640 ( GIBCO ) containing 10 % FBS ( GIBCO ) , 100 U ml – 1 penicillin and 100 m g ml – 1 streptomycin at 37 1 C in humidiﬁed air containing 5 % CO 2 . Labeling of trastuzumab with boron - dipyrromethene – mono - N - hydroxy - succinimidyl ester . We dissolved BODIPY - mono - NHS derivatives in DMSO to obtain 10 mM stock solutions . We incubated trastuzumab with BODIPY - mono - NHS in 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 8 . 4 , at 22 1 C for 60 min in the dark . We separated the BODIPY - trastuzumab conjugate from free BODIPY by using a PD - 10 column ( GE Healthcare ) and PBS pH 7 . 4 ( GIBCO ) T E C H N I C A L R E P O R T S 108 VOLUME 15 [ NUMBER 1 [ JANUARY 2009 NATURE MEDICINE © 2009 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

Assuming that the protein was obtained without any loss at the separation step , we determined the DOL ratio ( BODIPY [ mol ] / trastuzumab [ mol ] ) by measuring the absorbance of the labeled trastuzumab at 520 nm . Confocal imaging of internalization of the boron - dipyrromethene – labeled trastuzumab into NIH3T3 HER2 + cells . We incubated NIH3T3 HER2 + cells on poly - L - lysine – coated dishes in RPMI 1640 without phenol red . We added a solution of BODIPY - labeled trastuzumab in PBS pH 7 . 4 into the medium at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nM IgG . We obtained confocal images at selected times with a U - LH100HG confocal laser - scanning unit coupled to an IY81FVBF inverted microscope with a PlanApo (cid:1) 60 objective lens ( Olympus ) . The excitation wavelength was 488 nm and the emission was ﬁltered with BA505IF ﬁlter . Tumor model . All procedures were carried out in compliance with the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal Resources ( 1996 ) and the National Research Councils of the US and Japan and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health or the University of Tokyo . We established the metastatic lung tumors by intravenous injection of 2 (cid:1) 10 6 tumor cells suspended in 200 m l of PBS in 8 - week - old female nude mice ( National Cancer Institute Animal Production Facility ) . We performed side - by - side comparative experiments with HER2 + lung metastatic tumor – bearing mice to directly compare always - on ﬂuoro - phore – conjugated trastuzumab with pH - activatable ﬂuorophore – conjugated trastuzumab for speciﬁcity and living cell monitoring at 19 d after injection of NIH3T3 HER2 + cells . We conducted two - color experiments with two injected cell lines of lung metastases in mice ( RFP - transfected Balb3T3 HER2 – RFP + and 3T3 HER2 + ) to evaluate the speciﬁcity of HER2 - expressing tumor detection at 12 d ( Balb3T3 HER2 – RFP + ) and19 d ( 3T3 HER2 + ) after injection of cells 31 . Fluorescence imaging in mice . We injected probes ( 50 nM ) in 0 . 066 M PBS through the tail vein into tumor - harboring mice and left the mice alone for 1 d . Then we anesthetized and killed the mice and opened the thorax . We captured ﬂuorescence images in the thorax with a Maestro In Vivo Imaging System ( CRI ) . The excitation wavelength was 480 – 520 nm , and we obtained emission spectra from 500 nm to 800 nm . We created unmixed images with the use of authentic spectral patterns of BODIPY , RFP and the background 32 . Note : Supplementary information is available on the Nature Medicine website .
