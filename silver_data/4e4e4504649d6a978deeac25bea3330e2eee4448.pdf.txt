In this review , we discuss various endogenous factors that can positively impact the EPR effect in tumor tissues . Further , we discuss ways to augment the EPR effect by use of exogenous agents , as well as practical methods available in the clinical setting . Some innovative examples developed by researchers to combat cancer by the EPR mechanism are also discussed . Cancer has been , and still remains , one of the most dreaded diseases and a major threat to human life . Most of the conven - tional cancer chemotherapy – the standard treatment – is not always successful , even after 50 years of research , although lymphocytic leukemia and Hodgkin’s lymphoma are treated rather successfully in this way [ 1 ] . Conventional chemotherapy delivers the toxic anticancer agent indiscriminately , to tumors or normal organs and tissues . Therefore , we need to devise cancer - selective drug delivery to avoid undesirable systemic side - effects . One way of tackling these problems is to deliver anticancer drugs selectively to the tumor site . Among the most effective strategies , in terms of drug delivery , is exploiting the anatomical and pathophysiological abnormalities of tumor tis - sue , particularly the tumor vasculature , utilizing the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect [ 2 ] . By harnessing this unique characteristic ( EPR effect ) of solid tumors , the selective delivery of macromolecular anticancer drugs to the tumor site , with pin - pointed accuracy , has become a reality . This approach can be compared to the ‘magic bullet’ concept put forward by Paul Ehrlich at the turn of the 20th century . This review dis - cusses the concept of the EPR effect and the factors inﬂuencing the EPR effect , as well as demonstrating examples of macromo - lecular tumor targeting and suggesting possible ways to further enhance this effect in vivo . Enhanced permeability and retention effect : theory , principles and consequence The theory behind enhanced permeability and retention , pathophysiology and anatomy of tumor vasculature When tumor cells multiply , cluster together and reach a size of 2 – 3 mm angiogenesis is induced , to cater for the ever - increasing nutrition and oxygen demands of the growing tumor [ 3 ] . This neovasculature differs greatly from that of normal tissues in microscopic anatomical architecture [ 4 ] . For instance , the blood vessels in the tumor are irregular in shape , dilated , leaky or defective , and the endothelial cells are poorly aligned or disorga - nized with large fenestrations . Also , the perivascular cells and the basement membrane , or the smooth - muscle layer , are frequently absent or abnormal in the vascular wall . Tumor vessels have a wide lumen , whereas tumor tissues have poor lymphatic drainage [ 2 , 4 – 7 ] . This anatomical defectiveness , along with functional abnorm - alities , results in extensive leakage of blood plasma components , such as macromolecules , nanoparticles and lipidic particles , into the tumor tissue . Moreover , the slow venous return in tumor tissue [ 8 , 9 ] and the poor lymphatic clearance mean that macromolecules are retained in the tumor , whereas extravasation into tumor interstitium continues . This phenomenon , termed the EPR effect , was described by us almost 20 years ago , and is the basis for the selective targeting of macromolecular drugs to the site of solid tumors [ 2 ] . It is possible to achieve very high local concentrations of polymeric drugs at the tumor site , for instance 10 – 50 - fold higher than in normal tissue within 1 – 2 days .

Interestingly , the EPR effect does not apply to low - mole - cular - weight drugs because of their rapid diffusion into the circu - lating blood followed by renal clearance [ 6 , 12 – 14 ] . Factors affecting the enhanced permeability and retention effect Vascular endothelial growth factor Vascular permeability factor ( VPF ) [ 15 ] , identical to vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , has a signiﬁcant role in tumor angiogenesis [ 16 , 17 ] . In addition to being a mitogen for endothe - lial cells , it plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and , perhaps , in metastasis because of its induction of vascular permeability [ 15 ] . Increased vascular permeability will lead to an enhanced extra - vasation of macromolecules . Besides VEGF , the EPR effect is further ampliﬁed by numerous other vascular mediators described below and listed in Table 1 [ 18 – 24 ] . Bradykinin and prostaglandins Bradykinin ( BK ) and prostaglandins ( PGs ) play an important role in enhanced vascular permeability in inﬂammatory and tumor tissue , and thus sustain tumor growth . We extensively studied the role of BK in infection , inﬂammation and cancer [ 18 – 21 , 25 – 28 ] , and reported that the signaling cascade upstream of BK is upre - gulated in tumor compartments and is involved in the EPR effect of tumors [ 28 ] . Moreover , overexpression of BK receptors in var - ious human and rodent solid tumors has been observed [ 27 – 29 ] . PGs are synthesized by cyclooxygenase ( COX ) - 1 and - 2 , and PGE 2 is produced in human and experimental tumor models [ 30 , 31 ] . It was found that the COX inhibitor indomethacin sig - niﬁcantly repressed vascular permeability in sarcoma S - 180 and other tumor models [ 18 ] . Beraprost Na 1 , the prostacyclin PGI 2 agonist , enhanced the EPR effect 2 - fold , which led to a decrease in tumor blood ﬂow of almost 70 % [ 32 ] . These vascular mediators did not affect the blood ﬂow much in healthy organs ( only (cid:2) 10 % ) , for example the kidney and the liver . Nitric oxide Nitric oxide ( NO ) is a well known mediator of vasodilatation , hypotension , angiogenesis , cell proliferation and extravasation ( EPR effect ) . For instance , NO synthesized from L - arginine by NO synthase ( NOS ) induces vascular permeability in tumors [ 18 , 19 , 24 ] . Consequently , inhibition of NO generation , for exam - ple using the NOS inhibitor N v - monomethyl - L - arginine ( NMMG ) , was found to suppress vascular permeability and , thereby , the EPR effect and , hence , tumor growth [ 18 , 23 , 24 ] . It was found that extravasation , assessed by an intravenous ( i . v . ) injection of Evans blue , could be suppressed by NO scavengers and NOS inhibitor ( see Figure 1 ) , which conﬁrms that NO is responsible for vascular permeability in solid tumors [ 22 , 24 ] . Peroxynitrite and matrix metalloproteinases ( collagenases ) Peroxynitrite ( ONOO (cid:3) ) , which is formed by a rapid reaction between superoxide radical ( O 2 (cid:1)(cid:3) ) and NO , is extensively pro - duced in tumor and inﬂammatory tissues , where it activates promatrix - metalloproteinases ( proMMPs ) [ 23 , 33 – 35 ] . On the one hand , MMPs are known to facilitate cancer metastasis by Drug Discovery Today (cid:1) Volume 11 , Numbers 17 / 18 (cid:1) September 2006 REVIEWS TABLE 1 Factors responsible for the enhanced permeability and retention effect of macromolecules in solid tumors Anatomical factors Extensive angiogenesis and high vascular density Lack of smooth - muscle layer , pericytes , sporadic blood ﬂow ! passive dilatation of vessels in the angiotensin - II ( AT - II ) - induced hypertensive state ! more leakage Defective vascular architecture ! extensive leakage Meager lymphatic clearance ! enhanced retention of macromolecular drugs and lipidic particles in the interstitium of tumors Slow venous return ! accumulation of macromolecules in the interstitium Generation of permeability - enhancing factors as follows Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF , or VPF ) Bradykinin ( BK ) and / or 3 hydroxypropyl BK Nitric oxide ( NO ) Peroxynitrite ( ONOO (cid:3) ) , a reaction product of superoxide radical and NO Prostaglandins ( PGs ) Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) ! proMMP is activated by ONOO (cid:3) Other proteinases ( e . g . kallikrein system ) ! involved in various protease cascades Other cytokines ( e . g . tumor necrosis factor , interleukin - 2 ) ! facilitate enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect FIGURE 1 Vascular permeability ( or enhanced permeability and retention effect ) as seen by Evans - blue – albumin complex uptake ( quantiﬁed by absorbance ) in sarcomaS - 180 tumors of various sizes in mice . Mice were administered with a nitric oxide ( NO ) scavenger 2 - phenyl - 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 - tetramethylimidazoline - 1 - oxyl 3 - oxide ( PTIO ) orally , or the NOSinhibitor L - N v - nitro - L - arginine methylester ( L - NAME ) intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) . Dose : PTIO , 125 mg / kg ( (cid:4) 4 ) in 8 h ; L - NAME , 1 . 05 mg / kg ( (cid:4) 4 ) in 8 h . Note that the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect is suppressed by PTIO and L - NAME ( a lower uptake of the Evans - blue – albumin complex , compared with control tumor ) . Further note that the larger the tumor size the lesser the contribution of NO to the EPR effect , implicating the importance of NO in the early phase of tumor growth . See Refs [ 18 , 20 ] for details . www . drugdiscoverytoday . com 813 R e v i e w s (cid:1) P O S T S C R EE N degrading the extracellular matrix , whereas , on the other hand , they also enhance the EPR effect , which helps to support the growing tumor . The EPR effect was found to be inhibited by many MMP inhibitors [ 18 , 23 ] . Several MMP inhibitors were developed over the past 10 – 15 years ; however , none of their clinical devel - opment was successful . The ﬁrst reason for this failure could be that a fraction of tumor cells remains viable , and can therefore resume growth when the drug treatment is suspended . The second reason could be that MMPs are vital proteases in cellular metabo - lism , and high doses of MMP inhibitors cause toxicity . This has led to the termination of the development of many anti - MMP drugs . Contribution of anatomical and microscopic defects of tumor vasculature to the enhanced permeability and retention effect Recently , it was shown that dextran ( as large as 2000 kDa ) , con - jugated to a dye ( cascade blue ) , readily entered and stained the tumor interstitium within 30 min of exposure [ 36 ] . A similar result was reported almost 20 years ago and , more recently , by us [ 2 , 6 ] . Lactobacillus bacteria , (cid:2) 2 m m in size , were found to localize more in tumor tissue than normal tissue after i . v . injection [ 37 ] . Simi - larly , polymeric drugs with a molecular weight above the renal threshold , namely > 40 kDa , accumulate in tumor tissue for pro - longed time periods [ 2 , 6 , 12 , 38 ] . The rate of accumulation of the macromolecules and lipids in tumors is not proportional to their clearance rate because of the impaired lymphatic system [ 12 , 13 , 39 – 43 ] . Another prerequisite for the EPR effect is that the plasma concentration of the drug , as measured by the area under the time - concentration curve ( AUC ) , must remain high for > 6 h in mice and rats [ 2 , 6 , 12 , 41 ] . In other studies on the transport of macromolecules into tumor tissues , it was demonstrated that the vascular pore size of the LS174T tumor , a human colon adenocarcinoma , could be as large as 400 nm [ 44 ] . Taken together , these studies indicate that abnormalities and disfunction of tumor vasculature leads to the EPR effect , which can be harnessed to deliver macromolecular drugs that will extravasate into the tumor tissue and stay there for long periods of time . In this context , the term ‘passive targeting’ does not imply intratumoral retention , in contrast to the EPR effect . Augmentation of drug delivery to tumors by modulating the enhanced permeability and retention effect Angiotensin - II - induced hypertension The vascular density of many , if not all , tumors is higher than that of normal tissues . Further , tumor blood vessels lack a smooth - muscle layer , which plays a vital role in regulating blood pressure and ﬂow . In normal blood vessels , the smooth - muscle layer responds to vascular mediators such as BK , acetylcholine , NO and calcium via receptors on vascular smooth - muscle cells , help - ing to maintain constant blood ﬂow volume . In normal tissues , when hypertension is induced by infusing angiotensin - II ( AT - II ) i . v . , constriction of the smooth - muscle layer results in higher blood pressure and higher ﬂow rate . Interestingly however , the blood ﬂow volume remains constant [ 5 , 45 – 47 ] . By contrast , in AT - II - induced hypertension , tumor blood vessels cannot regulate the blood ﬂow volume because of the absence of the smooth - muscle layer . Consequently , blood ﬂow volume will increase in propor - tion to elevated blood pressure . In tumor - bearing rats , raising the systolic blood pressure by infusing AT - II caused a selective increase in tumor blood ﬂow volume , (cid:2) 2 – 6 times depending on the blood pressure attained [ 5 ] . Therefore , we anticipated that the induction of the hypertensive state would augment the EPR effect and , hence , the delivery of macromolecular drugs . In fact , when 51 Cr - labeled styrene - co - maleic - acid polymer ( SMA ) conjugated to neocarzinostatin ( NCS ) , known as SMANCS , or 51 Cr - albumin was injected i . v . in rats , after the systolic blood pressure was raised from 100 to 150 mmHg using AT - II for 15 min , there was a 1 . 3 – 3 . 0 - fold increase in accumulation of macromolecular drugs in tumor tissue [ 41 ] ( see Figure 2 ) . At the same time , a signiﬁcant reduction in the amount of drug delivered to healthy organs ( e . g . the kidney and the bone marrow ) was observed because of vasoconstriction and tighter endothelial gap junctions , which curbed extravasation of polymeric drugs . Similar results were obtained with SMANCS – Lipiodol 1 , administered under the AT - II - induced hypertensive state , in many solid tumors in patients including hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , metastatic liver cancer , renal cancer , cholan - giocarcinoma , pancreatic cancer , among others [ 46 ] . It is known that low - molecular - weight anticancer agents should only be administered at the recommended dose because of dose - limiting toxicity . However , using macromolecular drugs in sub - jects under the hypertensive state , in animal models as well as in the clinic , it was possible to achieve a > 5 - fold higher concentra - tion of anticancer drugs in the tumor compared with normoten - sive conditions , even though the hypertension was maintained only for (cid:2) 20 min [ 41 , 46 ] ( Maeda , H . et al . upublished results ) . Use of nitric - oxide - releasing agent and angiotensin - converting - enzyme inhibitors Not only can vasoconstrictors ( AT - II ) be used to enhance vascular permeability , vasodilators are also suited to increase the EPR effect by widening the endothelial gaps of tumor - feeding arteries . In one such case , in humans , the NO - releasing agent isosorbide dinitrate ( ISDN ; Nitrol 1 ) was infused into the local tumor - feeding artery using a catheter ( local ) , whereas concomitantly AT - II was injected systemically . This permitted enhanced opening of the feeding artery , and more drug entered the tumor . This technique further enhanced the site - speciﬁc delivery of SMANCS – Lipiodol 1 to the tumor . In this context , PGI 2 agonist ( Beraprost Na 1 ) was also found to be useful , as discussed previously [ 32 ] . Also discussed earlier , BK is upregulated in many tumors ; it is also degraded by angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) . Thus , it is conceivable that inhibition of ACE will increase the local concen - tration of BK in the tumor . In experiments , the use of ACE inhibitors , such as temocapril , elevated the BK level and , hence , the EPR effect [ 26 , 47 ] . More importantly , even under normoten - sive conditions , ACE inhibitors facilitated the increased delivery of macromolecular drugs to tumors [ 47 ] . Pro - enhanced permeability and retention effect of anticancer agents affecting blood vessels While analyzing the EPR effect of macromolecular anticancer agents , it was important to record the inﬂuence that the vascular mediators or the drugs themselves had on the EPR effect . We have observed that proinﬂammatory anticancer agents that generate superoxide radical and NO ( or activate proMMP to MMP , for REVIEWS Drug Discovery Today (cid:1) Volume 11 , Numbers 17 / 18 (cid:1) September 2006 814 www . drugdiscoverytoday . com R e v i e w s (cid:1) P O S T S C R EE N example SMANCS , anthracyclins , mitomycin C and nitrosourea ) induce enhanced vascular permeability and , hence , a pro - EPR effect [ 19 , 48 , 49 ] . In this context , we observed an enhanced EPR effect for SMANCS in treated patients . It was recently reported that certain anticancer drugs , such as doxorubicin , upregulated VEGF , resulting in increased vascular permeability [ 50 ] . Advantages of polymer conjugates with regard to the enhanced permeability and retention effect Prolonging half - life , stealth - character and reduced antigenicity Because accumulation of macromolecules by the EPR effect is a progressive phenomenon , it is essential that the drugs are stable in plasma for long time periods . In addition to prolonging the half - life in plasma of low - molecular - weight drugs or proteins , polymer conjugation also guides the drugs to their target by the EPR effect [ 51 ] . It also confers stealth character and suppresses antigenicity of the proteinaceous drugs , as well as diminishing uptake by the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) or macrophages ( M f ) . Therefore , the half - life of polymeric drugs in the blood circulation can be extended greatly [ 6 , 52 – 54 ] . Immunopotentiation or biological - response modiﬁer Polymer conjugates , such as SMANCS for instance , have displayed various immunomodulating properties : M f activation [ 55 – 59 ] ; induction of interferon - g production [ 56 , 59 ] ; and augmentation of natural killer ( NK ) cells [ 57 , 59 ] , stimulating antitumor immu - nity to tumors in mice . Similar ﬁndings were also reported for pyran copolymer and other anionic polymers that can induce interferons and cytokines [ 60 , 61 ] . Enhancing solubility , cellular uptake and stability It is well known that many promising drugs cannot be used because of their poor water solubility . The conjugation of such drugs to water - soluble polymers often confers water solubility [ 53 , 54 , 62 ] . Micellar encapsulation can afford similar beneﬁts [ 40 , 63 ] . Moreover , many proteins and drugs that have poor intestinal absorption can be rendered orally active by conjuga - tion with a hydrophobic polymer in combination with an oily formulation [ 64 ] . Further , the stability ( and shelf - life ) of the drug or protein could be remarkably improved by using an oily formulation [ 65 ] . Receptor - mediated drug targeting Besides EPR - based targeting , we can enhance intracellular uptake of polymeric drugs by utilizing receptor - mediated internalization . To this end , ligands ( or targeting moieties ) can be attached to the polymer backbone , which will act as a secondary uptake mechan - ism following EPR - based primary accumulation . Epitope - depen - dent targeting based on antibody conjugates also initially depends on EPR - based primary targeting [ 11 ] . An example of ligand - depen - dent targeting is galactosamine ( targeting moiety ) attached to poly [ N - ( 2 - hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide ] ( HPMA ) copolymer bearing doxorubicin , targeted to the liver ( known as PK2 ) [ 66 ] . There are several other examples of receptor - mediated drug deliv - ery reported elsewhere [ 10 , 11 , 67 , 68 ] . Patient compliance and quality of life Owing to the prolonged retention of polymeric drugs by the EPR effect and enhanced plasma half - life , polymer - conjugated drugs require less - frequent administration compared with free drugs , which is a great beneﬁt to patients [ 69 ] . One such example is the use of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) – L - asparaginase ( Oncaspar 1 ) in the Drug Discovery Today (cid:1) Volume 11 , Numbers 17 / 18 (cid:1) September 2006 REVIEWS FIGURE 2 Diagrammatic representation of the enhanced permeability and retention effect . ( a ) Shows the diffusion of a low molecular weight ( Mw ) drug ( black spots ) in ( i ) and a high Mw drug ( green spots with yellow circles ) in ( ii ) , from the blood vessels into the interstitium of tumor tissue ( large pink circles ) . Note that low Mw drugs can diffuse freely in and out of the tumor blood vessels because of their small size and , hence , the effective concentration of the drug in the tumor diminishes after 1 h when the drug concentration in plasma becomes low ( a ; i ) , whereas the high Mw drug cannot diffuse back into the blood stream because of its large size . Thus , there is progressive accumulation of macromolecular drug in the tumor tissues with time by the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect ( a ; ii ) . In ( b ) , we show a diagrammatic representation of vascular leakage in response to angiotensin - II ( AT - II ) - induced hypertension and the subsequent contraction of the smooth - muscle layer . Note that normal blood vessels ( b ; i ) will constrict in the hypertensive state ( restricting the extravasation of macromolecular drugs to normal tissues or organs owing to tighter endothelial gap junctions ) , whereas in tumor blood vessels ( b ; ii ) there will be passive dilatation , because of the absence of a smooth - muscle layer , leading to enhanced extravasation of macromolecular drugs and , hence , augmentation of the EPR effect .

Limitations and a word of caution on the use of polymer conjugates With many researchers working with polymer drug conjugates , micellar drugs and nanoparticles ( on the basis of EPR effect for targeted delivery ) , it is essential to be aware of the fate of the polymer used ( i . e . its molecular weight , solubility , biocompatibil - ity , biodegradability and clearance from the body ) . For instance , the basic unit of the polymer used should preferably be smaller than the size of the renal excretion threshold ( < 40 kDa ) , or biodegradable . Hydrophobic polymers , if resistant to degradation in vivo , are mostly eliminated via the bile , although they occa - sionally localize in the skin . Therefore , the total amount of poly - mers to be administered could be important . Some polymers could illicit an immune response or allergic reactions , more so in second or subsequent injections , although these side - effects can be con - trolled by corticosteroid and antihistamine . When one devises micromachines or nanocapsules , or drugs encapsulated in carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) , the ultimate fate and speciﬁc site of accumulation must be clearly studied . For instance , many anticancer agents generate oxygen free - radicals in aqueous systems , and CNTs containing such agents , or transition metals , will behave in a similar way to asbestos , which can cause mesothe - lioma [ 72 , 73 ] . Also , large materials ( when administered i . v . ) will be preferentially deposited in the lung , because the ﬁrst - pass effect will capture such particles in the lung owing to physiological , anatomical reasons . However , under the adequate precautions , there are many synthetic and natural polymers that are totally safe materials for drug carriers . Polymeric drugs in tumor - targeted delivery based on the enhanced permeability and retention effect The SMANCS – polymer conjugate of copoly ( styrene maleic - acid ) with neocarzinostatin The ﬁrst prototype macromolecular anticancer agent , SMANCS , developed in our group , was approved for clinical use in Japan in 1993 . The plasma half - life of SMANCS is (cid:2) 20 times longer than that of native NCS [ 2 , 14 , 38 , 46 ] . Further , NCS increased lipid solubility after conjugation with SMA , which enabled administra - tion of SMANCS together with the lipid contrast agent Lipiodol 1 . SMANCS – Lipiodol 1 ( injected via the tumor - feeding artery ) resulted in drug retention > 2000 - fold higher in tumor tissue than in blood plasma , and the drug remained in the tumor for several weeks [ 7 , 14 , 38 ] . Under these circumstances , accurate quantiﬁca - tion of the drug ( in lipid contrast agent ) that accumulates in the tumor becomes possible using an X - ray computed tomography ( CT ) scan [ 74 ] . The uptake of SMANCS – Lipiodol 1 in the tumor is particularly high because the arterial injection into the tumor - feeding artery beneﬁts from the powerful ﬁrst - pass effect , in addi - tion to the EPR effect . Consequently , 90 % of the patients with HCC treated by this procedure ( Seldinger’s method ) exhibited remarkable tumor regression and a simultaneous decrease in a - fetoprotein levels ( a speciﬁc tumor marker for hepatoma ) [ 14 , 38 ] . Further , SMANCS – Lipiodol 1 , given intra - arterially under an AT - II - induced hypertensive state , showed a more intense drug uptake and clear tumor staining , and a faster rate of tumor regres - sion compared with administration in the normotensive state [ 38 ] . Moreover , it was observed that a lower dose of drug was enough for an adequate therapeutic effect . This was because increased hydro - dynamic pressure facilitated the opening up of the gaps between the endothelial cells , and extravasation of the drug occurred at the tumor vasculature only ( not in the normal vessels , see earlier section ) . PEG - conjugated oxidoreductases Production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) at the tumor site is another cancer - selective - toxicity approach . One such agent , xanthine oxidase ( XO ) , catalyzes the oxidation of purine and produces ROS , O 2 (cid:1)(cid:3) and H 2 O 2 . However , the high binding afﬁnity of native cationic XO to blood vessels causes systemic vascular damage . To overcome this shortfall , XO was chemically conju - gated to PEG [ 75 ] . Similarly , another ROS - producing redox enzyme , D - amino - acid oxidase ( DAO ) , was conjugated to PEG for tumor - targeting , taking advantage of the EPR effect [ 76 ] . When these conjugates were injected ( i . v . ) into tumor - bearing mice , much higher accumulation of the conjugates was seen in the tumor , as compared with native enzymes . The in vivo half - life and the AUC of PEG – DAO increased 2 . 6 - and 2 . 9 - fold , respectively , compared with native DAO . Accumulation of PEG – DAO was found in tumors , but not in healthy organs [ 76 ] . The advantage of this method is based on the fact that tumors are highly vulner - able to oxygen - radical stress owing to downregulation of catalase [ 76 ] , and DAO is an endogenous enzyme and our healthy body tissue can scavenge H 2 O 2 effectively ( catalase - mediated ) , in con - trast to tumor tissue . Thus , these results demonstrate the EPR effect and the tumor - selective antitumor effect of PEG – XO and PEG – DAO by the generation of ROS , therefore warranting further investigation . PK1 a HPMA copolymer – doxorubicin conjugate PK1 is a HPMA polymer conjugated to doxorubicin with a tetra - peptide linker , having an apparent molecular weight of 30 kDa . This polymer conjugate is stable in circulation , but cleaved by cathepsin B following endocytic uptake after EPR - mediated accu - mulation in tumor insterstitium . By using the polymer conjugated to doxorubicin , a 70 - times higher concentration of doxorubicin was found in mouse melanomas , compared with healthy tissues [ 10 , 77 ] . The maximum tolerable dose ( MTD ) of the conjugate increased ten times , compared with that of the free - drug ( non - conjugated ) . In Phase I trials , the MTD of PK1 was 320 mg / m 2 ( doxorubicin - equivalent ) , which was 4 – 5 - fold greater than the safe dose of free - drug . Despite cumulative doses up to 1680 mg / m 2 ( doxorubicin - equivalent ) , no cardiotoxicity ( a side - effect typical of antracyclines ) was observed . Antitumor activity in chemother - apy - resistant or refractory patients ( including breast cancer ) was also seen with the use of PK1 at doses of 80 – 320 mg / m 2 ( doxor - ubicin equivalent ) , consistent with tumor - targeting by the EPR effect . PK1 is currently in Phase II trials for breast , colon and non - small - cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ 10 , 77 ] . PEGylated liposomes : targeting tumor vasculature Liposomes have been used as carriers for the targeted delivery of anticancer drugs and several of them are already used clinically [ 78 ] . PEG - conjugated stealth liposomes have a long plasma half - REVIEWS Drug Discovery Today (cid:1) Volume 11 , Numbers 17 / 18 (cid:1) September 2006 816 www . drugdiscoverytoday . com R e v i e w s (cid:1) P O S T S C R EE N life and can avoid uptake by RES . In the clinical setting , liposomal antracycline Doxil 1 and DaunoXome 1 were successfully targeted to tumors by EPR . Targeted liposome ( PEG – APRPG ) conjugated to distearoyl - phosphatidyl - ethanolamine ( DSPE ) showed enhanced accumulation in tumors in vivo ( when tested in colon 26 NL - 17 carcinoma - bearing mice ) [ 79 ] . An adriamycin - encapsulated lipo - some modiﬁed with PEG – APRPG showed more - efﬁcient tumor growth - suppression than liposome modiﬁed with PEG only [ 80 ] , indicating that the secondary targeting via APRPG ( targeting moiety ) can enhance the primary targeting by the EPR effect . SMA anthracyclines : a new micellar platform technology Using an amphiphilic SMA polymer , micelles containing doxoru - bicin or pirarubicin were constructed through a noncovalent inter - action between SMA and the drugs [ 40 , 63 ] . The resulting micelles showed high solubility in water and were stable upon lyophiliza - tion , freeze – thawing and / or sonication ( 30 kHz ) . An in vivo anti - tumor assay of SMA – pirarubicin ( at doses of 20 mg / kg in mice bearing sarcomaS - 180 tumor ) revealed completetumor eradication in100 % oftestedanimals , andallsurvivedfor > 1year [ 40 ] . Thefree - drug - equivalent concentration of pirarubicin in the tumor after administration of SMA – pirarubicin was 13 - times higher than the concentration observed after administration of the free - drug alone . The plasma AUC of SMA – pirarubicin was > 200 - fold higher than non - conjugated pirarubicin in vivo . Similar results were observed withSMA – doxorubicinmicelles [ 63 ] . Thisremarkableresultcanalso be attributed to the EPR effect of these micellar drugs . Conclusion The EPR effect is commonly observed in most solid tumors , either primary or metastatic in nature . The EPR effect is modulated or mediated by various factors produced by tumor cells , inﬁltrating leukocytes or even tumor - surrounding normal cells . Obviously , many vascular mediators , such as BK , PGs and NO , also affect normal blood vessels near tumor tissue . Also , vascular density and microanatomical defects play important roles in this phenomenon . The EPR effect will confer most macromolecular and liposomal or micellar drugs with selective tumor - targeting characteristics , and once delivered to the tumor these macromo - lecular drugs will remain in the tumor tissues for long periods of time ( days to months ) . Even targeting drugs that are conjugated to monoclonal antibodies will rely on access to tumor tissue , mediated by the EPR effect . The EPR effect can be further aug - mented by elevating the systemic blood pressure using AT - II . Consequently , the delivery of macromolecular drugs will be facili - tated . The next step after EPR - driven tumor delivery will be to access target molecules in tumor cells , after liberation of drugs from their carriers . Intracellular access of drugs to molecular targets is frequently limited by the release rate or uptake rate of macromolecules by endocytosis , or by receptor - mediated uptake into the cells . Diffusion - dependent uptake of drugs can also take place after liberation from the carriers , although at a slower rate . However , dividing tumor cells are known to have a more active endocytic uptake than non - dividing normal cells . Thus far , the EPR effect is one of the most common character - istics that differentiate a tumor from normal healthy tissue . A judicious choice of drug carriers ( which can exploit the EPR effect ) and targeting moieties ( which can guide the drugs to , or into , the cells ) will be a good combination for better therapy . Augmentation of EPR - dependent uptake to a tumor is further possible by the use of an AT - II - induced hypertensive state , and this will be applicable for a wider range of solid tumors .
