Review article Integrins : dynamic scaffolds for adhesion and signaling in platelets Sanford J . Shattil and Peter J . Newman The major platelet integrin , (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 , is re - quired for platelet interactions with pro - teins in plasma and the extracellular ma - trices ( ECMs ) that are essential for platelet adhesion and aggregation during hemo - stasis and arterial thrombosis . Ligand binding to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 is controlled by inside - out signals that modulate receptor confor - mationandclustering . Inturn , ligandbind - ing triggers outside - in signals through (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 that , when disrupted , can cause a bleeding diathesis . In the past 5 years there has been an explosion of knowl - edge about the structure and function of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 and the related integrin , (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 . These developments are discussed here , and current models of bidirectional (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 signaling are presented as frameworks for future investigations . An understand - ing that (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 functions as a dynamic molecular scaffold for extracellular and intracellular proteins has translated into diagnostic and therapeutic insights rel - evant to hematology and cardiovascular medicine , and further advances can be anticipated . ( Blood . 2004 ; 104 : 1606 - 1615 ) © 2004 by TheAmerican Society of Hematology Introduction The platelet is a tightly regulated adhesion machine . Restrained in its functions while in the bloodstream , its adhesive , hemostatic , and proinﬂammatory capabilities are unleashed at sites of vessel injury to generate the primary hemostatic plug , catalyze ﬁbrin formation , and supply soluble and membrane - bound factors that promote wound healing . 1 While platelets can adhere to damaged endothelial cells , 2 their principle adhesive surface is the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , which becomes exposed in injured vessels and offers a panoply of ligands for platelet adhesion receptors . 3 Within this context , integrin adhesion receptors , and (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 in particular , play critical roles in platelet function . Integrins are heterodimeric ( (cid:1)(cid:2) ) type I transmembrane recep - tors , each subunit typically containing a relatively large extracellu - lar domain , a single - pass transmembrane domain , and a short cytoplasmic tail composed of 20 to 60 amino acids . 4 Platelets express several integrins ( (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 , also called glycoprotein IIb - IIIa [ GPIIb - IIIa ] ; (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 ; (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) 1 ; (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) 1 ; (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) 1 ) . Integrins are , in effect , “2 - faced” receptors , one face oriented to the extracellular space and interactive with cognate ECM ligands and the other oriented to the cell interior and interactive with cytoplasmic proteins . Ligand binding to either face can trigger information transfer , or signaling , across the plasma membrane to “activate” cellular functions at the other face . Figure 1 illustrates this bidirectional signaling using (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 as an example . Basic research conducted in the past 3 decades on many facets of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 structure and function has led to remarkable break - throughs culminating in the development of a chimeric anti - (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 monoclonal antibody and small - molecule receptor antagonists now used parenterally to limit the formation of occlusive platelet thrombi in acute cardiovascular indications . 5 , 6 On the other hand , clinical trials of oral (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 antagonists have been disappointing and suggest that long - term extracellular blockade of ligand binding to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 might even be dangerous . Conceivably , then , further basic studies of this proven therapeutic target , and of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 signaling in particular , might lead to newer and better ways to diagnose , prevent , or treat arterial thrombosis or other conse - quences of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 dysfunction . The purpose of this review is to highlight recent experimental and conceptual advances in the integrin ﬁeld that are particularly relevant to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 and platelets . It will draw from structural analyses of integrins and studies of human and mouse platelets , with the caution that platelets from these 2 species are similar but not identical . 7 - 9 Several excellent general reviews of integrin signaling are also available . 4 , 10 - 16 Structural basis of (cid:2) 3 integrin signaling Structure of the (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 extracellular domain Our ﬁrst glimpse into (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 structure was provided nearly 20 years ago when approximately 230 - kDa (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 complexes were puriﬁed from detergent - solubilized platelet membranes and visual - ized by electron microscopy . 17 Rotary - shadowed , negatively stained images revealed an approximately 23 - nm ( 230 - Å ) complex consist - ing of an approximately 8 - nm ( 80 Å ) globular head and 2 approximately 16 - nm ( 160 Å ) ﬂexible stalks . In the absence of detergent , (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 aggregated into rosettes that appeared to be contacting each other at the tips of their stalks ( Figure 2A - B ) . Following the cloning of (cid:1) IIb and (cid:2) 3 and using epitope - mapped antibodies , Weisel and colleagues 18 correctly deduced that the stalks contain the C - terminal , transmembrane domain – containing segment of each subunit , and the globular head contains the N - terminal portions . These investigators also found that ﬁbrinogen , von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) , and ﬁbronectin interact with the globular head ( Figure 2C - D ) , thus identifying this domain as From the Departments of Cell Biology and Molecular and Experimental Medicine , The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ; and the Blood Research Institute , theBloodCenterofSoutheastern Wisconsin , Milwaukee , WI .

These ﬁndings were corrobo - rated by the demonstration of ﬁbrinogen binding to a recombinant (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 head domain lacking the (cid:2) 3 stalk . 19 A number of early models of integrin structure , such as the one shown in the top left panel of Figure 3 , were developed based on electron microscopic images , peptide and epitope mapping , photo - afﬁnity and chemical cross - linking , and biochemical analyses of cysteine disulﬁde – bonding patterns . Portrayed were such structural features as ( 1 ) an (cid:1) IIb subunit composed of an approximately 120 - kDa heavy - chain disulﬁde bonded to an approximately 23 - kDa light chain ; ( 2 ) 4 (cid:1) IIb calcium - binding domains ; ( 3 ) a small N - terminal cysteine - rich domain in (cid:2) 3 attached by a disulﬁde bond to “cysteine - rich repeats” within the body of the molecule ; and ( 4 ) a large , protease - sensitive “disulﬁde - bonded loop” within (cid:2) 3 bounded by residues 121 and 348 and containing the major ligand - binding sites . Recent determination of the crystal structure of the extracellular segment of (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 has provided a major advance . 20 Remarkably , many of the structural and functional domains predicted in earlier models are recognizable in the 12 domains identiﬁed in the crystal , albeit with much higher resolution , and with some notable sur - prises . As shown in Figure 3 , the 4 Ca 2 (cid:3) - binding domains in (cid:1) V are part of a (cid:2) - propeller , the structure of which had been predicted . 21 A large immunoglobulin - like “thigh” domain comprises the remain - der of the (cid:1) V subunit’s contribution to the integrin headpiece . In (cid:2) 3 , the N - terminal cysteine - rich segment has become the plexin / Figure 1 . Integrin activation is bidirectional and reciprocal . The (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 equili - brates between resting and activated states , the resting state predominating in unstimulated platelets and the activated state in stimulated platelets . Conversion from resting to activated does not imply a single , abrupt change but rather a series of coordinated and linked conformational transitions . ( A ) Inside - out signaling . Agonist - dependent intracellular signals stimulate the interaction of key regulatory ligands ( such as talin ) with integrin cytoplasmic tails ( in this case the (cid:2) 3 tail ) .

Finally , the previously observed (cid:1) V stalk is now composed of 2 rigid “calf” modules , and the former cysteine - rich repeats of the (cid:2) 3 stalk have morphed into 4 endothelial growth factor ( EGF ) – like domains , which , together with a novel ﬂowerlike structure termed the (cid:2) - terminal domain ( (cid:2) TD ) , completes the stalk . Comparison of the predicted structures of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 with those actually found in the (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 crystal can be found in Table 1 . Several groups have attempted to reconcile the (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 crystal structure with electron microscopic images analyzed with reﬁned methods . 15 , 22 In one example , electron cryomicroscopy was used to derive a 2 - nm ( 20 - Å ) resolution Fourier shell transformation density map of hydrated (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 complexes frozen in a low - afﬁnity , unliganded state . Taking liberties to introduce a few kinks into the ﬂexible hinge regions within the 2 subunits , the authors were able to visually ﬁt the 12 domains of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 into the extracellular region of their 3 - dimensional contour map . They suggest that their model may represent the structure of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 as it exists in the surface membrane of resting platelets . 22 Structure of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains Since the short cytoplasmic tails of (cid:1) IIb and (cid:2) 3 play key roles in signaling , much attention has focused on whether they have an ordered 3 - dimensional structure and how they might interact with each other and with intracellular proteins . Vinogradova et al 23 were the ﬁrst to determine a nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) structure for a membrane - anchored form of an isolated (cid:1) IIb tail and found that it formed an N - terminal (cid:1) - helix followed by a turn predicted to straighten out upon integrin activation . Ulmer et al 24 employed NMR spectroscopy to analyze the (cid:1) IIb and (cid:2) 3 cytoplas - mic tails in aqueous solution and found them to be largely unstructured , with a tendency for the N - terminus of (cid:2) 3 to form a helix and the downstream NPLY 747 motif to form a reverse turn that could support talin binding . Interestingly , neither these authors nor Li and colleagues 25 could ﬁnd any evidence for interaction between the (cid:1) IIb and (cid:2) 3 tails themselves , despite the fact that the latter group expressed the tails in a relatively native state—that is , attached to their respective transmembrane domains buried in phospholipid . Rather , the transmembrane domains , which were present in a largely (cid:1) - helical conformation , actually promoted the formation of homodimers and homotrimers . Based on the observa - tion that certain mutations within the (cid:2) 3 transmembrane domain enhance the tendency to form (cid:1) IIb - (cid:1) IIb and (cid:2) 3 - (cid:2) 3 - (cid:2) 3 homomeric associations , while at the same time conferring constitutive ﬁbrino - gen - binding activity , these workers proposed that homomeric transmembrane helix associations might drive subunit reshufﬂing to increase receptor clustering and avidity for ligand . 26 On the other hand , cysteine scanning mutagenesis of the (cid:1) IIb and (cid:2) 3 transmem - brane domains in the context of the full - length integrin expressed in model cell systems suggests that interactions through a speciﬁc heterodimer interface help to maintain the default low - afﬁnity state of the integrin . Furthermore , separation of the transmembrane helices is linked to an increase in (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 afﬁnity for ligands . 27 Since a portion of the integrin residues involved in the transmission of bidirectional signals are embedded in the plasma membrane , 28 , 29 the structure and function of the (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 transmembrane domains clearly warrant further investigation . In contrast to the above studies , several others have found evidence that integrin cytoplasmic tails can and do interact with each other , and in some cases the nature of the interaction appears to change as a consequence of inside - out activation . A tightly packed approximately 3 - nm ( 30 - Å ) long cylindrical rod was observed in the region of the (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 transmembrane domain by electron cryomicroscopy , corresponding to a pair of tightly packed , parallel , right - handed (cid:1) - helical coils . 22 The cytoplasmic domains could be seen extending from the transmembrane (cid:1) - helix as a single , cohesive , heart - shaped density of approximately 7 kDa . Two recent NMR structures also show extensive , although some - what contradictory , interactions between (cid:1) IIb and (cid:2) 3 cytoplasmic tails near the membrane - proximal interface of each tail . 30 , 31 The latter structure showed intersubunit contacts composed of hydropho - bic and hydrostatic interactions mediated by amino acid residues highly conserved among integrins . Arecent study has shown that in the presence of membrane - mimetic micelles , the cytoplasmic faces of the (cid:1) IIb and (cid:2) 3 cytoplasmic tails and the NPLY region of (cid:2) 3 become embedded in the membrane , a conformation that differs Table 1 .

Heavy - / light - chain cleavage site NA Evident only upon reduced SDS - PAGE , posttranslational cleavage of the (cid:1) subunit takes place within the Golgi apparatus but appears inconsequential for integrin structure or function .

Furthermore , the binding of puriﬁed talin to (cid:2) 3 caused un - clasping of the tails and changes in tail - membrane interactions ( Figure 4A ) . 32 These in vitro results are largely consistent with ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) studies of green ﬂuorescence protein ( GFP ) – tagged (cid:1) L and yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) – tagged (cid:2) 2 subunits in living cells . 33 Based on changes in FRET , the cytoplasmic tails were calculated to be close to each other in resting cells but become separated by up to 10 nm ( 100 Å ) following either ligand binding to (cid:1) L (cid:2) 2 or agonist - induced cellular activation . Overall , these data provide compelling evidence that intersubunit cytoplasmic tail associations , and possibly heterodimeric transmembrane associations , function to maintain the (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 complex in a resting , nonadhesive conformation , while disruption of these interactions causes separation of the tails and propagated changes in the extracellular domains to increase (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 afﬁnity . Conformational changes associated with (cid:2) 3 integrin activation Several observations indicate that the extracellular domains of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 and (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 must undergo conformational transitions upon cellular activation or ligand binding . First , activation of platelets or endothelial cells induces the binding of arginine - glycine - aspartic acid ( RGD ) – containing antibody Fab fragments to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 and (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 , respectively . 34 , 35 In the case of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 , Fab binding requires discontinuous regions of the (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) - propeller and the (cid:2) 3 A domain . 36 Second , when platelets are activated by agonists , a change in FRET is observed between ﬂuorophore - conjugated antibodies bound to (cid:1) IIb and (cid:2) 3 . 37 Finally , anti - (cid:1) IIb or anti - (cid:2) 3 antibodies of the ligand - induced binding sites ( LIBS ) type preferen - tially recognize the ligand - occupied form of the integrin , and they in turn increase receptor afﬁnity . In terms of primary amino acid sequence , the epitopes for many of these LIBS antibodies are located a relatively long distance from the ligand - binding head - piece , suggesting that the integrin is subject to long - range confor - mational changes . 38 Differences in (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 structure have been visualized in nega - tively stained electron microscopic images of the integrin in apparent low - and high - afﬁnity states . 39 The low - afﬁnity , unligand - ed form was present as a compact , V - shaped structure highly reminiscent of the bent conformation found in the crystal structure of (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 ( Figure 3 ) , becoming extended upon ligand binding into the “head (cid:3) 2 tails” conﬁguration previously visualized by other investigators ( eg , Figure 2 ) . This transition has been described as analogous to a “switchbladelike” movement such that the extended form may represent the ligand - bound high - afﬁnity receptor . How - ever , a less drastic change may be all that is required for initial transformation of (cid:2) 3 integrins from low - to high - afﬁnity state . Coined the “deadbolt” model , 14 inside - out signals are postulated to transmit conformational changes through the transmembrane heli - ces into the immediately proximal (cid:2) TD . The CD loop of the (cid:2) TD , which in resting integrins acts like a deadbolt to pin the F / (cid:1) 7 loop of the (cid:2) A domain forward to obstruct contact with macromolecular ligands ( Figure 4B ) , then moves out of the way , allowing the F / (cid:1) 7 loop to swing away from the ligand contact site , making it available for productive , high - afﬁnity ligand binding . Experimental evidence that displacement of the F / (cid:1) 7 loop is involved in ligand binding comes from studies of (cid:1) L (cid:2) 2 , where mutational shortening of the (cid:2) 2 (cid:1) - helix by approximately one turn resulted in a constitutively active receptor . 40 One of the most attractive features of this model is that larger - scale structural changes are not required to convert (cid:2) 3 integrins into high - afﬁnity receptors . Furthermore , the model does not preclude switchblade - like straightening of the bent integrin or separation of the cytoplas - mic tails , both of which are likely to promote outside - in signaling in response to ligand binding . Additional studies are required to rigorously test and reﬁne existing models of integrin activation and , in particular , to fully understand coordinated transitions among the integrin extracellular , transmembrane , and cytoplasmic domains , molecular movements that will likely affect outside - in as well as inside - out signaling . Integrin clustering In addition to conformational changes , cell activation promotes the lateral mobility and clustering of integrins within the plane of the plasma membrane . 41 Initially , small oligomers or “microclusters” below the resolution of the light microscope may contribute to “avidity” or “valency” regulation of ligand binding . 15 , 42 Microclus - tering in native membranes or living cells has been difﬁcult to study , but new techniques are beginning to open up this area of investigation . 33 , 43 The (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 clustering may be promoted by several mechanisms , including the binding of multivalent li - gands , 43 , 44 ligand self - association , 45 , 46 lateral interactions of inte - grins with other membrane proteins , 47 reversible integrin linkages to the actin cytoskeleton , 48 and homomeric interactions of the transmembrane domains . 26 Integrin conformational change and clustering are not mutually exclusive ; they are complementary and may even be mechanistically linked . Each may be involved in different aspects of bidirectional signaling . For example , conforma - tional change seems to be the dominant way in which ligand binding to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 and (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 is regulated , while clustering is Figure 4 .

Under these conditions , talin is not bound to (cid:2) 3 . When cells and talin are activated ( right ) , the head domain of talin ( H ) isreleasedfrominhibitionbyitsroddomain ( R ) andbindsto (cid:2) 3 . Thisdisrupts the relatively weak integrin tail - tail and tail - membrane interactions , leading to splaying of the tails and bidirectional signaling . Changes similar to those induced by talin binding may be induced by the binding of ﬁbrinogen to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 . From Vino - gradova et al 32 with permission . ( B ) The deadbolt model of inside - out integrin activation . In the nonactivated integrin , the elongated CD loop of (cid:2) TD is in close proximity to the (cid:2) Adomain , allowing it to effectively “deadbolt” the F / (cid:1) 7 loop in place , preventing ligands ( transparent blue circle ) from making contact with (cid:2) A residues necessary for high - afﬁnity binding . Inside - out signaling is hypothesized to induce conformational changes in the cytoplasmic tails that when transmitted through the transmembranedomainswouldunlockthedeadbolt . Theresultinglossofconstraints imposed by the CD loop would allow the F / (cid:1) 7 loop to rock back ( exaggerated as shown ) from the ligand contact site , making the latter available for binding . Certain LIBS antibodies may also move the deadbolt , promoting ligand binding independent of inside - out signals . Adapted from Xiong et al 14 with permission .

For example , GPIb - IX - V function is most relevant under conditions of high shear typical of the arteriolar and capillary circulations and in stenotic arteries . 3 An important but under - studied process is inhibition or reversal of ligand binding to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 . Activation of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 is negatively regulated in a complex manner by cyclic adenosine monophos - phate ( AMP ) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( GMP ) , gener - ated by interaction of platelets with prostacyclin ( PGI 2 ) and nitric oxide ( NO ) , respectively , 9 and by an endothelial cell ecto - ADPase ( CD39 ) . 55 In mouse platelets , the excitatory function of GPVI and GPIb - IX - V is partly dependent on the associated FcR (cid:5) - chain , whose tyrosine - phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motifs ( ITAMs ) help recruit tyrosine kinases to these receptors . 53 , 54 Signaling through GPVI and GPIb - IX - V is damp - ened by platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 ( PECAM - 1 ) , an immunoglobulin superfamily receptor whose immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibitory motifs ( ITIMs ) recruit SHP - 1 ( Src homol - ogy 2 [ SH2 ] domain – containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 ) and SHP - 2 tyrosine phosphatases . 56 - 58 Signaling intermediates that link agonist receptors to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 Receptors couple to second messengers such as Ca 2 (cid:3) , cyclic nucleotides , and products of phospholipases and tyrosine ki - nases . 9 , 53 A major gap remains in how second messengers effect functional changes in (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 . For example , protein kinase C ( PKC ) , phosphatidylinositol 3 – kinase ( PI 3 - kinase ) , and Rap1b have been implicated as intermediates in promoting inside - out signaling , but the identities and activities of the relevant effectors of these enzymes remain to be determined . 9 , 59 Rap1b serves as a timely case in point . Rap1 is a member of the Ras family of small guanosine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) and has been implicated generally in promoting cell adhesion and migration through effects on afﬁnity and / or avidity modulation of integrins . 60 Rap1b , the predominant isoform in platelets , cycles from a guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) – bound inactive state to a GTP - bound active state upon addition of agonists to Gi - coupled receptors , 61 , 62 binding of collagen to GPVI , 63 and even binding of ﬁbrinogen to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 . 64 Rap1b associates with the actin cytoskeleton of activated platelets and is a substrate for protein kinase A , although the effect of this phosphor - ylation is unknown . 64 A link between Rap1b and afﬁnity modula - tion of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 has been established in primary murine megakaryo - cytes . 35 , 65 Overexpression of a constitutively active Rap1b mutant or of CalDAG - GEFI , a Rap exchange factor , potentiates agonist - induced ﬁbrinogen binding to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 , and this effect is blocked by inhibitors of actin polymerization . Overexpression of Rap1 – GTPase - activating protein ( Rap1 - GAP ) , which converts Rap1 - GTP to Rap1 - GDP , partially blocks agonist - induced ﬁbrinogen binding , suggesting that endogenous Rap1b promotes , but is not sufﬁcient for , inside - out signaling , perhaps through some effect on the actin cytoskeleton . This interpretation is consistent with the recent observation that Rap1b - deﬁcient mouse platelets undergo reduced aggregation responses to agonists . 66 Interestingly , CalDAG - GEFI contains a C1 domain that may bind diacylglycerol and an EF hand domain that binds Ca 2 (cid:3) . 60 Consequently , generation of these second messengers by phospho - lipase C could provide one means by which Rap1b activity is regulated in platelets . However , other exchange factors for Rap1b have been identiﬁed 60 and some may be expressed in platelets . Rap1b effectors involved in (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 signaling have yet to be identiﬁed . In this context , RAPL is a Rap1 - GTP – binding protein that reportedly coimmunoprecipitates with and clusters (cid:1) L (cid:2) 2 when T lymphocytes are activated by chemokines . 67 Its presence and function in platelets have not been determined . Proximal regulation of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 by integrin - binding proteins In theory , ligand binding to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 could be regulated by integrin interactions with intracellular , extracellular , or transmembrane molecules . RGD - containing ligands , even short peptides , can stabilize the high - afﬁnity conformation of puriﬁed (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 . 68 In platelets , MnCl 2 or LIBS antibodies convert (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 into a high - afﬁnity conformation . 69 Some have speculated that certain (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 antagonists or soluble CD40 ligand may exert similar effects in vivo 6 , 70 and that some drug - dependent anti - (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 antibodies may recognize LIBS epitopes exposed by binding of the drug . 71 , 72 Reducing agents such as dithioethreitol can activate puriﬁed or platelet (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 , as can mutation of single cysteines within the (cid:2) 3 EGF repeats . 73 The platelet surface and (cid:2) 3 integrins in particular are reported to possess thiol isomerase activity , 74 , 75 leading to the proposition that disulﬁde exchange may help to regulate (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 activation . 76 , 77 Also , a pool of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 may form complexes with CD9 ( a tetraspanin ) 47 or CD47 ( a thrombospondin receptor ) . 78 The relationship between CD47 and (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 appears particularly com - plex . Speciﬁc peptides from thrombospondin can bind to CD47 and activate platelet G proteins , providing one way for CD47 to regulate (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 . 78 In addition , platelet CD47 can interact with receptors in activated endothelial cells , leading to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 activa - tion . 79 Finally , the extracellular portion of CD47 bound to a thrombospondin peptide can directly modulate (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 activation state in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells . 80 Despite these observations , no platelet aggregation abnormalities have been reported in CD47 - deﬁcient mice . Evidence to date indicates that any role for extracellular or transmembrane molecules in afﬁnity modulation is secondary to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 regulation by intracellular proteins , and in particular talin , which engage the integrin cytoplasmic tails . Talin1 is an approxi - mately 270 - kDa antiparallel dimer composed of an approximately 50 - kDa N - terminal FERM domain , which contains F1 - 3 subdo - mains and assumes a phosphotyrosine - binding ( PTB ) domain – like fold , and an approximately 220 - kDa C - terminal rod domain ( Figure 5 ) . 81 - 83 F2 - 3 contains a major binding site for integrin (cid:2) cytoplasmic tails and several other proteins , including type I (cid:5) phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase ( PIPKI (cid:5) ) , an enzyme respon - sible for generating the lipid second messenger , PIP 2 . 84 The rod domain , separated from the FERM domain by a calpain cleavage site , contains the major binding sites for F - actin . 1610 SHATTILand NEWMAN BLOOD , 15 SEPTEMBER 2004 (cid:1) VOLUME 104 , NUMBER 6 For personal use only . on September 13 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Interest in talin as an integrin regulator comes from several lines of investigation . First , talin ( or F2 - 3 ) binds speciﬁcally to integrin (cid:2) tails in vitro , including (cid:2) 1 , (cid:2) 2 , and (cid:2) 3 . 82 , 85 - 88 Second , overexpres - sion of the FERM or F2 - 3 domains activates (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 in CHO cells . 82 , 86 , 88 Third , as depicted in Figure 4A , NMR , x - ray crystallo - graphic , and FRET analyses are consistent with the idea that talin interacts with the N - terminus and midportion of (cid:2) tails , thereby splaying the (cid:2) and (cid:1) tails and modifying their interactions with the membrane . 31 , 33 , 89 , 90 Fourth , mutations in talin F2 - 3 or (cid:2) tails predicted to disrupt their interaction also eliminate integrin activa - tion in CHO cells . 88 Thus , the inability to bind talin may explain the thrombasthenic phenotype of human platelets where the membrane - distal half of the (cid:2) 3 tail has been deleted . 91 Finally , knockdown of talin in CHO cells and megakaryocytes by RNA interference ablates energy - dependent activation of (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 3 integrins . 88 Important questions remain about the proximal regulation of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 . How is talin’s recruitment to the platelet membrane and to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 regulated by agonists ? 92 Perhaps talin transforms from a compact “autoinhibited” conformation to an open conformation in response to activation signals , analogous to several other proteins that inﬂuence the actin cytoskeleton , such as vinculin , Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , and PAK ( p21 - activated ki - nase ) . Signaling events hypothesized to regulate talin include PIP 2 binding , 93 serine - threonine phosphorylation , 94 and proteolysis by calpain . 95 In addition , Src - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKI (cid:5) may increase its ability to compete with integrin (cid:2) tails for talin , 96 and tyrosine phosphorylation of (cid:2) tails may reduce their binding to talin . 94 Does talin regulate integrin avidity as well as afﬁnity ? Talin’s role in linking integrins to actin ﬁlaments , in clustering of integrins into adhesion complexes , and in force generation at the cell - ECM interface certainly place it in a position to do so . 81 , 97 , 98 Finally , do other integrin cytoplasmic tail – binding proteins regulate (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 afﬁnity ? Both calcium and integrin binding protein ( CIB ) , which binds to (cid:1) IIb , and (cid:2) 3 endonexin , which binds to (cid:2) 3 , activate (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 in model cell systems . 99 - 101 However , (cid:2) 3 endonexin does not activate (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 in the absence of talin , 88 and determining the inside - out functions of this and other tail - binding proteins in platelets requires further study . Regulation of outside - in signaling Maximal secretory , procoagulant , and clot retraction responses of platelets generally require ligand binding to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 and close platelet - platelet contact . The term “contact - dependent signaling” has been used to describe this phenomenon , in which other ligand - receptor pairs have also been implicated , including ephrin / Eph receptor kinases , CD40 ligand / CD40 , and Gas6 / Axl - Sky - Mer receptor kinases . 70 , 102 - 104 The best understood example of contact - dependent signaling is outside - in signaling through (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 . 105 Platelet adhesion to ﬁbrinogen or VWF triggers morphologic changes ranging from ﬁlopodial and lamellipodial extension to full spreading . 106 - 109 As in nucleated cells , these changes are mediated by effectors of the Rho GTPases , cdc42 , Rac1 , and Rho A . 107 , 110 The morphologic changes are associated with dynamic modiﬁca - tions of the actin cytoskeleton that affect the polymerization state and organization of actin . 109 , 111 (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 participates in this process by nucleating signaling complexes at adhesion sites that regulate actin . 106 , 109 , 112 , 113 Platelets and (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 - expressing CHO cells adher - ent to ﬁbrinogen have frequently been used as model systems to study this process . In both cases , outside - in signaling occurs in a discrete pattern whereby ligand binding initiates integrin clustering and assembly of a nascent signaling complex proximal to the cytoplasmic tails of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 , followed by the growth of a larger actin - based signaling complex . Initiation of outside - in signaling Among the earliest detectable biochemical responses of platelets to ﬁbrinogen binding is activation of Src and Syk protein tyrosine kinases . 112 Occupancy of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 byﬁbrinogen causes integrin microclustering , 43 , 44 which appears necessary for this tyrosine kinase activation . 49 , 51 Although some monovalent ligands promote (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 homo - oligomerization in detergent solution , 114 there is no unequivocal evidence yet that they do so or trigger outside - in signaling in vivo . Soluble CD40 ligand can bind and induce outside - in signaling through (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 , but it is a trimer , suggesting even in this case that clustering of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 is required . 70 , 115 Components of a nascent (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 signaling complex have been identiﬁed in platelets and CHO cells based on their ability to coimmunoprecipitate with (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 or to become rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated by integrin - associated Src or Syk , even in the presence of inhibitors of actin polymerization . 112 Buttressed by studies with puriﬁed proteins as well as by detection of speciﬁc protein - protein interactions in living cells , 116 the following se - quence of events for assembly of the (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 signaling complex can be envisioned . ( 1 ) Src kinases constitutively bound to the (cid:2) 3 cytoplasmic tail become activated when ﬁbrinogen engages and clusters (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 51 , 112 ( Figure 6 ) . ( 2 ) Syk is recruited to the (cid:2) 3 tail and activated by Src . 112 , 117 ( 3 ) Src and / or Syk phosphorylate Figure 6 . Model for (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 regulation of Src . ( Left ) According to current structural models , 140 Src family kinases are membrane associated and maintained in a “clamped , ” inactive state through intramolecular interactions between the SH2 domain and a C - terminal phosphotyrosine motif at Tyr529 ( Y529 ) , and the SH3 domain and a polyproline motif in the linker region between the SH2 domain and the N - lobeofthecatalyticdomain . ( Middle ) Inplatelets , apoolofc - Src ( andseveralother Src family kinases ) is constitutively bound to (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 through interaction of the (cid:2) 3 cytoplasmictailwiththeSH3domain . ThismaymaintainSrcinapartiallyunclamped , primed state but not yet fully active , in part because Tyr529 remains phosphorylated by integrin - associated Csk . ( Right ) Upon (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 ligation , Src becomes clustered and Csk dissociates from the integrin complex . The net result is dephosphorylation of Tyr529 by an unidentiﬁed tyrosine phosphatase and autophosphorylation of Tyr418 ( Y418 ) in the Src activation loop . Consequently , Src is now unclamped and fully active to phosphorylate downstream effectors . From Arias - Salgado et al 51 and Obergfell et al 112 with permission . Figure 5 .

INTEGRIN SIGNALING IN PLATELETS 1611 BLOOD , 15 SEPTEMBER 2004 (cid:1) VOLUME 104 , NUMBER 6 For personal use only . on September 13 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From substrates , including SLP - 76 , ADAP and c - Cbl ( molecular adap - tors ) , and Vav ( a Rac GTPase ) , that are implicated in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton . 118 - 120 Propagation of outside - in signaling As the nascent complex assembles , many additional proteins are recruited that are capable of inﬂuencing actin dynamics and reorganization . These include Rac , Nck ( an adapter ) , PAK , PI 3 - kinase , and vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) , an actin - bundling protein ( Figure 7 ) . Although not all components of the signaling network have been identiﬁed , 3 proteins warrant particular discussion here because each is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src and / or Syk during platelet aggregation and spreading and each probably helps to morph nascent complexes into actin - based complexes . These proteins are (cid:2) 3 itself , phospholipase C (cid:5) , and (cid:1) - actinin . Phosphorylation of the (cid:2) 3 cytoplasmic tail at residues 747 and 759 may enhance post – ligand - binding events by generat - ing docking sites for SH2 - containing protein ( Shc ) , an adapter in Ras signaling , and myosin , a motor protein involved in clot retraction and stabilization of platelet aggregates . 121 , 122 Mice in which these tyrosines have been mutated to phenylalanine exhibit rebleeding from tail wounds and subtle defects in clot retraction and platelet aggregation . 105 , 123 Phospholipase C (cid:5) is a substrate of Src and Bruton tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) kinases , and its activation by tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 generates some of the diacylglycerol and inositol phosphate ( IP3 ) needed for maximal platelet aggregation and spreading . 113 Diacylglycerol and IP3 - dependent Ca 2 (cid:3) ﬂuxes activate conventional and novel isoforms of PKC discussed previously in the context of inside - out signaling . Preliminary studies show that certain PKC isoforms coimmunoprecipitate with (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 under some conditions , and broad - spectrum PKC inhibitors block platelet spreading on ﬁbrinogen ( Churito Buensuceso , Ales - sandra Soriani , Achim Obergfell , Koji Eto , and S . J . S . , unpublished observations , January 2004 ) . Thus , some integrin - associated pro - teins may regulate both phases of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 signaling . (cid:1) - actinin is a homodimeric actin - binding protein that localizes to integrin adhesion sites . The nonmuscle isoform found in platelets contains binding sites for vinculin , zyxin , and the mem - brane - proximal portions of (cid:2) 1 , (cid:2) 2 , and (cid:2) 3 integrin cytoplasmic tails . 124 Overexpression of full - length (cid:1) - actinin in ﬁbroblasts leads to stabilization of adhesion sites , while integrin - binding fragments disrupt actin stress ﬁbers , focal adhesions , and mechanotransduc - tion . 125 (cid:1) - actinin becomes tyrosine phosphorylated on a single N - terminal residue in response to platelet aggregation or spread - ing . 126 Phosphorylation may be mediated by focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , whose own activation is dependent on actin polymerization following platelet costimulation through agonist and (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 recep - tors . In a model system , tyrosine phosphorylation of (cid:1) - actinin reduced its cosedimentation with F - actin . 126 Therefore , phosphory - lation of (cid:1) - actinin during later stages of outside - in signaling might regulate (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 linkages with actin and the assembly / disassembly of actin - based signaling complexes . Many facets of outside - in (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 signaling remain to be explored . What are the identities and functions of the phosphatases that counterbalance the effects of the protein and lipid kinases that operate in integrin signaling ? What are the roles in platelets of other proteins , such as skelemin and integrin - linked kinase , reported to interact with the (cid:1) IIb or (cid:2) 3 cytoplasmic tails in model sys - tems ? 101 , 127 , 128 Disassembly of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 - based signaling complexes may be required to achieve full platelet spreading or to limit platelet adhesion and aggregation to the hemostatic plug . How is disassembly regulated ? Perhaps it involves (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 - dependent activation of FAK and its effectors . 129 , 130 Perhaps it involves speciﬁc protein or lipid phosphatases or proteases like calpain , which cleave (cid:2) 3 , Src , and other proteins upon platelet aggrega - tion . Do the other integrins in platelets engage in bidirectional signaling ? Recent investigations of (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 and (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) 1 suggest that they do . 53 , 131 - 133 How are they regulated ? Perspective (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 was identiﬁed as the platelet ﬁbrinogen receptor over 25 years ago . Ensuing investigations of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 and its relative , (cid:1) V (cid:2) 3 , have provided many key insights about integrin structure and function . Some of these have led to improvements in clinical practice , most notably the use of parental (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 antagonists to prevent arterial thrombosis . Future studies of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 signaling promise to yield additional information of clinical relevance . For example , while deﬁciency of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 is rare , speciﬁc defects in (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 - related signal transduction may account for many incom - pletely characterized bleeding disorders associated with defects in Figure 7 .

More generally , progress in integrin research can also be antici - pated in several other areas of interest to hematologists , among them elucidation of the relationships between integrin polymor - phisms , platelet function , and thrombotic risk ; the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenias ; the role of (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 in hematopoietic stem cells 136 ; and the development of drugs that modulate integrin signaling in inﬂammatory diseases and cancer .
