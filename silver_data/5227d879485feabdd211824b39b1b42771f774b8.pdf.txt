Whereas early data from symptomatic case confirmations suggested a lack of disease in children , subsequent contact tracing studies have found that children are likely to be infected . Governments are now facing immense pressure to weigh the public health benefit of interventions such as school closure against the significant economic disruption they impose . To motivate the discussion of age - stratified social distancing measures , we discuss potential biological mechanisms by which a skewed age distribution of cases may be generated and show through mathematical modelling how different age - targeted interventions are likely to affect the epidemic final size . We propose that identifying age - dependent transmissibility , in addition to susceptibility , will be essential to understand which social distancing measures are likely to be the most impactful going forward . Main Text Case reports associated with the pandemic SARS - CoV - 2 virus are strikingly skewed to older ages ( Figure 1B ) . This contradicts the role of social mixing in communicable disease dynamics : typically , age groups with high contact rates ( children ) experience higher rates of exposure than age groups with fewer contacts ( the elderly ) ( Figure 1C ) . Understanding why COVID - 19 ( the disease caused by SARS - CoV - 2 ) deviates from this expectation is crucial for implementing and subsequently relaxing appropriate interventions . If children are contributing to transmission , then school closure is likely to be impactful in slowing the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . If transmission is driven predominantly by adults , then focus should be on reducing their contacts . These critical decisions are being made now , and communities are enacting social distancing measures to varying degrees . Some countries now face the additional challenge of deciding which interventions should be relaxed to minimize economic disruption . We consider different hypotheses for the role of children in transmission and the extent to which social distancing among adults , with or without school closures , is expected to reduce the epidemic final size . The impact of social distancing measures will depend on the role of different age groups in transmission . There are several potential , non - mutually exclusive , explanations for the age profile of COVID - 19 cases : ( i ) contacts are far more frequent among adults than children in affected communities ; ( ii ) age groups demonstrate differential susceptibility to infection , either decreased in children or increased in the elderly ; ( iii ) children are acquiring and participating in transmission of the virus but are largely asymptomatic and thus not tested ; ( iv ) older individuals transmit significantly more than children per contact , leading to relatively skewed onward transmission . Intuitively , low contact rates in children and high rates in the elderly seem unlikely given that contact patterns are ubiquitously shown to feature highest rates among children ( Figure 1C ) ( 1 ) . However , in China , the coincident timing of the Lunar New Year followed by timely social distancing measures massively reduced contacts made between children ( i . e . , because of breaks from school ) , and possibly increased contacts between children and older age groups ( 2 ) . Although a likely contributor , this change in social structure is unlikely to explain the skewed age distribution on its own ( Figure 1D ) , particularly as these patterns have now been seen elsewhere . The second scenario ( children are less susceptible to acquisition ) may arise from pre - existing , cross - reactive immunity . Cross - protective immunity from previous seasonal coronavirus is a tempting but 3 unsupported hypothesis for children , wherein early - life exposure could afford antigenically broad , transient immunity . Alternatively , antibody - dependent enhancement ( ADE ) may arise through reactive but not neutralizing antibodies in older individuals that enhance viral entry and exacerbate disease . Although ADE is well described in terms of disease severity , it has not been considered in terms of enhancing susceptibility . Testing contacts of confirmed cases in China have found contrasting results : one not - yet - published study found that secondary attack rates were fairly uniform across all ages with a slight general increasing trend with age , whereas another found reduced risk of infection in younger individuals ( 2 , 3 ) . It is therefore currently unclear if children have superior protection from acquisition than adults given exposure to the same infectious dose . It is important to note that even if acquisition rates are lower in children than adults , overall transmission from infected children may still be significant . The third scenario ( children are asymptomatic ) is plausible given emerging case series data , which suggest that COVID - 19 disease is typically , but not exclusively , mild in children ( 4 ) . Milder cases are less likely to be picked up if detection depends on disease severity , lending support to this hypothesis . If this is the case , many of the conclusions on controlling transmission emerging from the large body of work attributable to pandemic influenza , including the impacts of school closures , will be portable to COVID - 19 control efforts . However , samples from influenza - like - illness surveillance suggested that the number of infected children may be genuinely low ( 5 ) . Clarification on the conclusions drawn by the WHO on these data will be important to understand if incidence in children truly is low , or an artefact of surveillance following substantial control measures . Increased transmissibility in older ages could result from transmissibility increasing as a function of disease severity . Individuals with more severe disease may shed more virus , or shed virus through a more transmissible route , increasing the likelihood that they infect susceptible contacts . Again , support for this hypothesis is limited , as early clinical findings suggest that children and asymptomatic individuals shed significant amounts of virus through respiratory and fecal routes ( 4 ) . However , the experience of the cruise ships , with an older demographic , shows that rapid spread in the absence of children is feasible . It will be important to consider this hypothesis should serosurveys find lower infection rates in children , as age - dependent transmissibility has profound implications for longer term control measures . Although we do not have definitive data to discriminate between these hypotheses , underreporting of infected children or age - dependent transmissibility currently seem the most plausible drivers of the age - distribution of COVID - 19 cases . It has been suggested that the apparent low rate of infection among children means school closures will have little impact ( 6 ) , but the true incidence in younger ages is likely greater than initial estimates which were skewed towards invasive disease ( 3 ) . If transmissibility does not vary by age , and only disease severity does , then school closures in addition to a substantial reduction in contacts made by adults would be necessary to reduce the effective reproductive number to below 1 ( Figure 2A & B ) . However , if transmission is being primarily driven by adults , then reducing contacts between these age groups becomes more important ( Figure 2C & D ) . Some viruses do demonstrate incidence that is highly skewed towards older ages ( e . g . , herpes zoster ) , though we are unaware of any such viral respiratory pathogen . Extremely low transmissibility in children that drastically increases in older adults is required to generate incidence patterns comparable to the distribution of COVID - 19 cases ( Figure 1D & E ) . Given the transmission route of SARS - CoV - 2 , a lack of transmission in children would be surprising . Distinguishing between these hypotheses will be achieved using a combination of serological surveillance , clinical observations and household studies . In the longer term , contact tracing studies to 4 discern the relative contributions of children and adults to overall transmission ( Figure 2E & F ) will also be important to understand when different interventions may be relaxed . Existing contact tracing data are limited in this regard , as the majority of index cases are clinically detectable infections and therefore predominantly adults . To understand if the probability of transmission per contact varies between infected children and adults , data are needed with younger index cases , many of whom may be asymptomatic . As SARS - CoV - 2 continues to gain traction at the community level , it will be important for epidemiologists and public health policy makers to reconcile epidemiological observations that deviate from expectation via an increased understanding of its biology .
