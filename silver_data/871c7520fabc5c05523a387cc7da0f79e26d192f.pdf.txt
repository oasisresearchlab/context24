This raises the question of whether CB1R regulates similar or distinct processes during the embryonic development of these two species . Here , we examined whether CB1R influences the migration and morphogenesis of neural crest cells and derivatives in both chicken and frog embryos . Early neurula stage chicken embryos were exposed to arachidonyl ‐ 2 ʹ ‐ chloroethylamide ( ACEA ; a CB1R agonist ) , N ‐ ( Piperidin ‐ 1 ‐ yl ) ‐ 5 ‐ ( 4 ‐ iodophenyl ) ‐ 1 ‐ ( 2 , 4 ‐ dichlorophenyl ) ‐ 4 ‐ methyl ‐ 1 H ‐ pyrazole ‐ 3 ‐ carboxamide ( AM251 ; a CB1R inverse agonist ) or Blebbistatin ( non - muscle Myosin II inhibitor ) in ovo and examined during migration of neural crest cells and at condensing cranial ganglia stage . Early tailbud stage frog embryos were bathed in ACEA , AM251 or Blebbistatin , and analyzed at late tailbud stage for changes in craniofacial and eye morphogenesis , and in patterning and morphology of melanophores ( neural crest ‐ derived pigment cells ) . In chicken embryos exposed to ACEA and Myosin II inhibitor , cranial neural crest cells migrated erratically from the neural tube , and the right , but not the left , ophthalmic nerve of the trigeminal ganglia was affected in ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated embryos . In frog embryos with inactivation or activation of CB1R , or inhibition of Myosin II , the craniofacial and eye regions were smaller and / or less developed , and the melanophores overlying the posterior midbrain were more dense , and stellate in morphology , than the same tissues and cells in control embryos . This data suggests that despite differences in the time of onset of expression , normal activity of CB1R is required for sequential steps in migration and morphogenesis of neural crest cells and derivatives in both chicken and frog embryos . In addition , CB1R may signal through Myosin II to J .

KEYWORDS craniofacial morphogenesis , eye , melanophores , Xenopus laevis and Gallus gallus embryos 1 | INTRODUCTION The endocannabinoid system ( known as the phytocannabinoid system in plants ) plays a wide range of functions in plants , fungi , and animals ( Gülck & Møller , 2020 ; McPartland et al . , 2006 ; Silver , 2019 ) . In plants , phytocannabinoid signaling is active in ultraviolet ( UV ) protection ( Arif et al . , 2021 ) . In vertebrates , endocannabinoid signaling has functions both in the embryonic period and in adulthood , including gametogene - sis ( Fonseca et al . , 2009 ; Oltrabella et al . , 2017 ; Taylor et al . , 2007 ) , neuronal circuit formation ( Berghuis et al . , 2007 ; Watson et al . , 2008 ) , immune response ( Almogi ‐ Hazan & Or , 2020 ) , and mood , learning and memory ( Kruk ‐ Slomka et al . , 2017 ) . The endocannabinoid signaling system involves the lipid cannabinoid ( CB ) CB1 and CB2 receptors , G ‐ protein coupled transmembrane receptors that can homodimerize or heterodimerize with each other ( Callén et al . , 2012 ) and with other proteins ( Mackie , 2005 ) . The CB receptors are activated extracellularly by the endogenous ligands anandamide or N ‐ arachidonoylethanolamine and 2 ‐ arachidonoylglycerol as well as exogenously , by delta ‐ 9 ‐ tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , and cannabidiol ( CBD ) . The cannabinoid 1 receptor ( CB1R ) and CB2R can signal through the intracellular calcium pathway ( Fan & Yazulla , 2003 ) or a variety of noncalcium cascades , including by regulating cytoskeletal actin remodeling ( Roland et al . , 2014 ) . Studies have demonstrated that cannabis or manipulation of CB signaling alters the embryonic development of various vertebrate animal models . In the 1960s and 1970s , cannabis injected intra - peritoneally or subcutaneously into pregnant rats , guinea pigs , and rabbits during early gestation induced teratogenic effects and congenital malformations in the offspring ( Persaud & Ellington , 1968 ) . In more chemically specific experiments , injection of THC or a synthetic “ herbal spice ” CB into pregnant mice resulted in increased frequency of cleft palate formation , and malformations in craniofacial complexes , eyes , and brains in fetuses ( Bloch et al . , 1986 ; Gilbert et al . , 2016 ) . Exposure of gastrula ‐ stage chicken Gallus gallus embryos to a water ‐ soluble THC analog resulted in defects in neural tube morphology , head process formation , and expression of neural markers ( Psychoyos et al . , 2008 ) . In Zebrafish , waterborne exposure to CBD or THC between blastula and larval stages induced eye , snout and jaw defects , as well as curved axes , tails and edema ( Carty et al . , 2018 ) . Finally , the knockdown of the main CB receptor CB1R in cleavage stage embryos of Xenopus laevis frogs led to smaller , less developed eyes in late tailbud stage embryos ( Zheng et al . , 2015 ) . Taken together , these studies demonstrate the impact of cannabis and CB signaling on neural , craniofacial and eye morphogenesis ( as well as overall body morphology ) during the embryonic development of various animal models . However , no previous studies , in any developing embryo , have directly addressed whether CB1R signaling specifically regulates the migration and morphogene - sis of the cranial neural crest or its derivatives , key embryological processes required for normal craniofacial and eye formation . In addition , the effects of both activating and inactivating CB1R signaling on craniofacial and eye morphogenesis were not examined in any one type of embryo in these earlier studies . The characteriza - tion and accessibility of neural crest migration and craniofacial morphogenesis in nonmammalian vertebrate embryos provide an opportunity to address these questions . In this study , we examined mechanisms for the main CB receptor , CB1R , in neural crest cell migration , craniofacial and eye morphogene - sis , and pigment cell density and morphology in chicken and frog embryos . Previous studies show that the time of onset of expression of CB1R is early ( during early neurulation ) in chicken embryos and late ( during early tailbud stage ) in frog embryos , making them complemen - tary models for the study of CB1R functions in sequential steps in migration and differentiation of neural crest cells and derivatives ( Cottone et al . , 2003 ; Psychoyos et al . , 2012 ; Zheng et al . , 2015 ) . 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 | Preparation of pharmacological reagents 2 . 1 . 1 | Chicken embryos Arachidonyl ‐ 2 ʹ ‐ chloroethylamide ( ACEA ) , a synthetic agonist of the CB1R , was obtained from Tocris and speed vacuumed to remove the ethanol solvent . The ethanol was substituted with dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) to prepare a 10mmolL − 1 stock solution . Stock solutions of N ‐ ( Piperidin ‐ 1 ‐ yl ) ‐ 5 ‐ ( 4 ‐ iodophenyl ) ‐ 1 ‐ ( 2 , 4 ‐ dichlorophenyl ) ‐ 4 ‐ methyl ‐ 1 H ‐ pyrazole ‐ 3 ‐ carboxamide ( AM251 ) , a CB1R antagonist ( Tocris ) and Blebbistatin ( Sigma ) , an inhibitor of Myosin II ATPase activity , were made by dissolving the reagents in DMSO to a 10mmolL − 1 concentration . 2 . 1 . 2 | Frog embryos For experiments with frog embryos , ACEA ( Tocris ) was considered a stock solution at the concentration provided by the manufacturer ( 13 mmol L − 1 in ethanol ) . Similar to the chicken embryo experiments , 10 mM stock solutions of AM251 ( Tocris ) and Blebbistatin ( Sigma ) were formed by dissolving the reagents in DMSO . 2 of 15 | MAHOMED ET AL . 2 . 2 | Obtaining and treating embryos 2 . 2 . 1 | Chicken embryos Fertile chicken eggs were obtained from a local farm and incubated at 37°C for 27 – 28h , to reach Stage 8 ( HH8 ; Hamburger & Hamilton , 1951 ) . Working concentrations ( 10µmol L − 1 ) of our reagents were made by dissolving the stock solutions in Howard ' s Ringer ' s saline ( Ringer ' s ) containing 1 : 100 penicillin / streptomycin solution . Using a gauge 18 needle , 3mL of egg white were drawn out of each egg , from the side , and each egg was opened by cutting a window at the surface of the egg , using sharp stainless ‐ steel scissors ( Fine Science Instru - ments , item 14060 ‐ 10 ) . All embryonic treatments consisted of applying 50µL of a 10µmolL − 1 solution of the appropriate reagent onto the dorsal aspect of HH8 embryos , in ovo . The eggs were resealed with tape and reincubated until the embryos reached HH13 or HH18 . To determine the potential effect of the vehicle , Ringer ' s control embryos were treated at HH8 with 50µL of Ringer ' s and collected at HH13 . Additional HH13 control embryos were collected without Ringer ' s pretreatment . Since Ringer ' s control did not result in a different phenotype than the untreated embryos , data from Ringer ' s controls and untreated controls were pooled . Treatment with ACEA or Blebbistatin essentially did not affect the survival of chick embryos to HH13 / 14 ( 75 % and 91 % survival , respectively ) compared to the control embryos , both with ( 83 % survival ) and without ( 58 % survival ) Ringer ' s treatment . The same was true for embryo survival to HH18 when treated with ACEA ( 61 % ) and AM251 ( 60 % ) , compared to con - trols ( 59 % ) . 2 . 2 . 2 | Frog embryos X . laevis frog embryos were generated by the natural mating of pairs of male and female adult frogs ( Nasco ) primed with human chorionic gonadotropin . Embryos were collected , dejellied , and cultured in 10 % modified Mark ' s Ringer ' s solution ( MMR ) and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber ( 1956 ) . All animal experiments were performed at Touro University California and were approved by the Touro University California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Early tailbud stage Xenopus embryos ( Stages 28 – 30 ) were transferred to Petri dishes containing 10 mL of 0 . 1X MMR solution alone , with 10 µL of vehicle ( ethanol or DMSO ) added , or with 10 µL of 1000X ACEA ( 13 mM ) , AM251 ( 10 mM ) or Blebbistatin ( 10 mmol L − 1 ) stock solutions in vehicle added . For experiments , this resulted in a 13 µmol L − 1 ( ACEA ) or 10 µmol L − 1 ( AM251 , Blebbistatin ) final bath concentration for the pharmacological reagents . These concentra - tions are similar to the concentrations used in previous studies that applied other pharmacological compounds to the bath of X . laevis embryos ( Chien et al . , 1993 ; Czesnik et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , the concentration of agonist ( ACEA ) we used was lower compared to a previous study that applied a synthetic THC analog ( at 110 – 320 µmol L − 1 ) to chicken embryos ( Psychoyos et al . , 2008 ) , but greater than theTHC concentrations present in fetuses of rat and monkey pregnant dams who were given THC in earlier experimental studies ( Bailey , 1987 ; Hutchings et al . , 1989 ) . The early tailbud stage 28 – 30 Xenopus embryos developed in the control or experimental solutions in an incubator for approximately 18 h at room temperature until they had become late tailbud stage embryos / young tadpoles ( developmental stages 39 – 40 ) . Essentially all embryos in a solution containing vehicle ( 96 % ) , or vehicle with ACEA ( 90 % ) , AM251 ( 95 % ) or Blebbistatin ( 96 % ) , survived at Stages 39 – 40 . In addition , for all the phenotypic features analyzed here , the late tailbud stage Xenopus embryos in MMR solution containing either vehicle compound ethanol or DMSO were not significantly different from the control embryos in MMR solution without vehicle . 2 . 3 | Fixation and antibody staining 2 . 3 . 1 | Chicken embryos Embryos collected posttreatment at HH13 were fixed for 1 day at 4°C , washed five times in large volumes of 1X phosphate ‐ buffered saline ( PBS ) and blocked at 4°C overnight in 1X PBS containing 0 . 5 % tween , 1 % bovine serum albumin , and 10 % donkey serum . HH13 embryos were then double ‐ stained with the primary antibodies Pax7 ( premi - gratory and migratory neural crest marker ) and HNK1 ( migratory neural crest marker ) . Both primary antibodies were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and used at 1 : 5 dilution in block , for 2 days at 4°C . Subsequently , five washes with 1X PBS were completed before incubation in secondary antibodies ( Alexa fluoro - phores from Thermo ‐ Fisher Scientific ) , applied at a 1 / 500 concentra - tion in block , for 1 – 2 days at 4°C . All embryos were washed extensively in 1X PBS before storage at 4°C and imaging . Immunohistochemistry with HH18 embryos followed the proce - dure detailed above with the difference that the primary antibody used to detect gangliogenesis wasTUJ1 ( marker of neuronal cell body and axon ; Covance ) dissolved 1 : 300 in block . 2 . 3 . 2 | Frog embryos When control and experimental frog embryos had developed to late tailbud stages ( developmental stages 38 – 40 ) , they were anesthetized in a 0 . 02 % tricaine solution and then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 1 – 2 h at room temperature . Following fixation , the embryos were rinsed three times in 1X PBS and stored in 1X PBS in vials at 4°C . 2 . 4 | Imaging 2 . 4 . 1 | Chicken embryos A Zeiss Stemi 305 microscope was used to examine and mount HH13 and HH14 embryos on slides , such that the brain vesicles of each embryo could be seen . HH18 embryos were plated on their right and MAHOMED ET AL . | 3 of 15 left sides to image both trigeminal ganglia . An upright , Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope accessorized with a HPX UV light source and an AxioCamMr3 _ 2 camera , was used to image each embryo using the software AxioVision Rel . 4 . 8 . 2 . 2 . 4 . 2 | Frog embryos Late tailbud stage ( developmental stages 38 – 40 ) X . laevis frog embryos were imaged with a Nikon SMZ500 dissecting microscope with fiber optic illumination , and either a Nikon color camera ( DS ‐ 5M ) with controller ( DS ‐ U1 ) driven by Nikon Elements Imaging software ( Version 3 . 1 ) , or a Scion Corporation monochrome camera ( CFW ‐ 1312M ) driven by micromanager software ( Version 1 . 4 ) . The frog embryos were first oriented to capture dorsal and lateral ( both left and right sides ) images . The heads of the late tailbud stage embryos were then transected from the bodies and oriented so that frontal images of the heads could be captured . 2 . 5 | Data analysis 2 . 5 . 1 | Chicken embryos stage 13 / 14 The FIJI software ( NIH ) was used to trace the border of the midbrain and the midbrain neural crest cells ( HNK1 ‐ positive ) of HH13 embryos . From these perimeters , the respective areas were computed . The ratio of midbrain neural crest cell area ( Figure 1a , orange dashes ) to midbrain area ( Figure 1a , green tracing ) was calculated in control and ACEA ‐ treated embryos . In HH14 embryos , the width of the embryonic head and the width of the field of migratory neural crest cells ( characterized by HNK1 expression ) were measured with FIJI software . The extent of the migrating neural crest cells was assessed using the following method : ( a ) a vertical line was drawn starting from the forming mandible using the posterior border of the eye as a reference point ( Figure 1b , orange arrow ) ; ( b ) for consistency , the shortest line was drawn from that point on the mandible to the top of the HNK1 field ( Figure 1b , green arrow ) ; ( c ) the same angle and reference point was used to extend a line from the mandible to the top of the head ( Figure 1b , sum of pink arrow and green arrow ) . The value from ( b ) was then divided by the value from ( c ) for control , ACEA ‐ and Blebbistatin ‐ treated embryos . These ratios were used to evaluate the proportion of head space occupied by migratory neural crest cells . 2 . 5 . 2 | Chicken embryos stage 18 For morphometric analysis of the trigeminal ganglia at HH18 , the area , perimeter , and circularity ( shape ) of each trigeminal ganglion in control , ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated embryos were measured . The area , perimeter , circularity , and length of the ganglion ' s maxilloman - dibular and ophthalmic lobes , with their associated nerves , were also measured ( Figure 2a ) . All measurements were taken separately on the right and left side of each embryo . 2 . 5 . 3 | Frog embryos ImageJ software ( NIH , Version 1 . 53 ) was used for morphometric measurements of frog embryos . In dorsal images of late tailbud stage embryos ( Stages 39 – 42 ) , the border of the head region was outlined , and perimeter and area were measured for this outline ( Figure 3a ) . In frontal images of the embryos , the distance between the eyes , and the distance between the center of the eyes to the top of the cement gland was measured ( Figure 3a ) . In lateral images of the embryos , the borders of the eyes were outlined , and their perimeter and area were measured ( Figure 3a ) . Pigmentation pattern and pigment cell morphology was analyzed from the posterior midbrain area in dorsal images of late tailbud stage frog embryos . The area and perimeter were measured for individual melanophores overlying the posterior midbrain . To obtain a pigment density measurement , the summed area of all pigment cells overlying the posterior midbrain was divided by the total area of the posterior midbrain . The circularity for individual melanophores was calculated using the formula 4 × π × area / perimeter 2 ( Figure 4 ) . 2 . 6 | Statistical analysis All data was stored in Excel spreadsheets . Due to the relatively small sample sizes , the Mann – Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis . A 95 % confidence interval was used to determine statistical significance of difference . 3 | RESULTS 3 . 1 | Over ‐ activating CB1R reduces the dispersion of cranial neural crest cells in the midbrain of chicken embryos To determine whether CB1R plays a role in the migratory behaviors of neural crest cells , chicken embryos were treated with ACEA , a CB1R agonist , at HH8 . At this stage , neural crest cells have not started migrating and are still found at the dorsal aspect of the neural tube ( Kulesa et al . , 2010 ; Kulesa & Fraser , 1998 ) . As cranial neural crest cells migrate , they disperse over the midbrain . Control embryos were either exposed to Ringer ' s ( vehicle ) or left untreated . Because both Ringer ' s and untreated groups gave similar results , these embryos were pooled and will be referred to as “ controls ” from this point . To observe neural crest migration after treatment , embryos were reincubated until HH13 , when cranial neural crest migration is in progress . Neural crest migration was assessed by normalizing the HNK1 ‐ positive domain ( neural crest domain ) area to the total midbrain area at HH13 ( Figure 1a ) . 4 of 15 | MAHOMED ET AL . Cranial neural crest cells in pharmacologically treated embryos dispersed differently in the midbrain than they did in control embryos . In ACEA ‐ treated embryos ( n = 11 ) , dramatically fewer HNK1 ‐ positive cells were seen migrating atop the midbrain , compared to the number of cells found in control embryos ( n = 11 ; Figure 1b , c ) . Furthermore , the neural crest cells present in ACEA ‐ treated embryos were collected in one area of the midbrain ( yellow outline ) ; this smaller distribution was reflected in a relatively small ratio of midbrain neural crest cell area ( yellow tracing ) to total midbrain area ( green tracing ; average ratio : 0 . 38 ; SE = 0 . 078 ; p < . 01 ; Figure 1d ) . The abnormal distribution of neural crest cells at the midbrain in HH13 chicken embryos treated with the CB1R agonist prompted us to investigate the impact of this disturbance on neural crest migration . As neural crest cells migrate , they remodel their actin cytoskeleton by altering Myosin II activity ( Berndt et al . , 2008 ) . Accordingly , we also performed experiments in which we treated HH8 embryos with Blebbistatin , a nonmuscle Myosin II ATPase inhibitor that interferes with actin ‐ dependent motility ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . Similarly , to the ACEA ‐ treated embryos , the neural crest cells present in Blebbistatin ‐ treated embryos ( n = 7 ) congre - gated in one area of the midbrain ( yellow tracing ) , producing a small ratio of midbrain neural crest cell area ( yellow outline ) to total midbrain area ( green outline ) ; average ratio : 0 . 60 ; SE = 0 . 151 ; p < . 01 ; Figure 1d ) . By contrast , midbrain neural crest in controls occupied almost the entirety of the midbrain area ( yellow outline ; average ratio : 0 . 86 ; SE = 0 . 078 ) . In brief , overactivation of signaling through CB1R inhibited cranial neural crest cells from spreading across the midbrain , as in control embryos .

Embryos were treated at premigratory neural crest stage 8 and collected at HH14 , when embryo turning offers a profile view of the head with neural crest cells having reached and accumulated at the edges of the forming jaw . We obtained a normalized migratory crest distance by calculating the ratio of the width of the HNK1 expression domain FIGURE 4 Perturbation of CB1R signaling impacts pigmentation pattern and pigment cell morphology in frog embryos .

( Figure 1b , green arrow ; Figure 1f – h , yellow arrows ) to total head width ( Figure 1b , sum of green plus pink arrows ; Figure 1f – h , green arrows ) , from a point on the jaw caudal to the eye ( Figure 1b , orange arrow ) . Both , overactivation of CB1R with ACEA , and inhibition of actomyosin interactions with Blebbistatin disturbed cranial neural crest migration patterns in HH14 embryos . In controls , the accumulation of the migratory neural crest cells at a greater distance from the midbrain resulted in a width of the HNK1 expression domain ( Figure 1f , yellow arrow ) with an average ratio : 0 . 49 ( SE = 0 . 014 ; n = 8 ; Figure 1j ) . By contrast , in embryos exposed to ACEA ( n = 8 ) , the HNK1 domain occupied a significantly smaller portion of the head ( average ratio : 0 . 44 ; SE = 0 . 029 ; p < . 05 ; Figure 1g , yellow arrow ; Figure 1j ) . Also reaching statistical significance , the larger width of the HNK1 field in embryos exposed to Blebbistatin ( 0 . 61 ; SE = 0 . 026 ; p < . 0001 ; n = 17 ) showed that cranial neural crest migration was decreased compared to controls ( Figure 1h , yellow arrow ; Figure 1j ) . These results support the notion that both overactivation of CB1R and inhibition of nonmuscle Myosin II perturb migratory behaviors in cranial neural crest cells . 3 . 3 | Overactivation and inactivation of CB1R disrupt trigeminal ganglion development in chicken embryos Neural crest cells are precursors of the peripheral nervous system ; as such , they contribute to all cranial nerves ( Le Douarin & Smith , 1988 ) . Since the migration of the cranial neural crest was dysregulated following the overactivation of CB1R , we asked whether the derivatives of those neural crest cells might also be affected . The largest sensory cranial nerve — the trigeminal ganglion ( Figure 2a ) — was examined at HH18 in chick embryos . Furthermore , to determine the potential effect of imbalance in CB1R signaling , in addition to overactivating CB1R in a test group with the agonist ACEA , we inhibited signaling through that receptor by applying the antagonist AM251 . Initial inspection and analysis showed that ACEA treatment decreased , whereas AM251 application increased , the proportion of the trigeminal ganglia displaying ophthalmic and maxillomandibular nerves ( Figure 2a ) . 40 % of ACEA ‐ treated embryos ( n = 20 ganglia in 10 embryos ) and 94 % of AM251 ‐ treated embryos ( n = 18 ganglia in 9 embryos ) displayed an ophthalmic nerve , compared to 80 % of controls ( n = 30 ganglia in 15 embryos ; Figure 2c , d ) . Similarly , whereas 60 % of maxillomandibular lobes in control embryos showed the beginning of axon formation , 40 % ( n = 20 ganglia ) and 83 % ( n = 18 ganglia ) of maxillomandibular lobes displayed nerve formation in ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated embryos , respectively . Morphometric analysis expanded our understanding of these phenotypic differences between experimental and control trigeminal ganglia , and showed that they stemmed from morphological changes occurring specifically on the right side of the embryo . The mean length , perimeter , and area of the right ‐ side ophthalmic lobe and its nerve were significantly smaller , and the mean circularity was significantly larger ( indicating a rounder shape ) , in ACEA ‐ exposed embryos than the same measure - ments from right ophthalmic lobes and nerves in controls ( Figure 2f – i and Table 1 ) .

MAHOMED ET AL . | 9 of 15 significantly smaller ( denoting a less round shape ) than control ophthalmic lobes with nerves ; however , the area and perimeter of the AM251 right ‐ side ophthalmic lobe with nerve were similar to controls ( Figure 2f and Table 1 ) . Similarly , the length of the right ‐ side maxillomandibular lobe with nerve was significantly shorter in the ACEA group than in the control group ( Figure 2f and Table 1 ) . However , in AM251 ‐ exposed embryos , all right ‐ side maxillomandib - ular parameters ( area , length , perimeter , circularity ) were similar to controls ( Figure 2f – i and Table 1 ) . As these measurements included both the lobes and the nerves of the trigeminal ganglia , the phenotypes could be due to differences between lobes rather than nerves . To confirm that these phenotypes were due to changes in the ophthalmic and maxillomandibular nerve projection and not in lobes , we also measured parameters for the lobes of the ganglia specifically , without their nerves . This analysis showed that in ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated embryos , length , perimeter , area , and circularity of the lobes were statistically similar to controls ( p < . 05 for all measurements ) . In brief , our data suggest that over ‐ activation and inactivation of signaling through CB1R oppositely modulate ophthalmic and max - illomandibular nerve formation in trigeminal ganglion . In addition , a discrepancy was observed between the right and left sides , as all left ‐ side trigeminal parameters were comparable to controls , with both pharmacological treatments . 3 . 4 | Manipulation of CB1R signaling perturbs craniofacial and eye morphogenesis in frog embryos The cranial neural crest gives rise directly to , and / or indirectly influences the differentiation of , the tissue in both the craniofacial and eye regions of vertebrate embryos ( Bryan et al . , 2020 ; Trainor , 2005 ) . Accordingly , we also examined whether morphogenesis of the craniofacial complex and eyes were altered by activation and / or inactivation of CB1R signaling activity . For these experiments , we used X . laevis frog embryos , which are more accessible than chicken embryos for examination of the craniofacial and eye regions . Frog embryos also express CB1R later than chicken embryos , beginning in the anterior neural ectoderm at the early tailbud stage ( Stage 25 ) and increasing in the developing craniofacial and eye regions at tailbud stages ( Stage 39 ; Zheng et al . , 2015 ) . The CB1R pharmacological agonist , ACEA , or inverse agonist AM251 , were applied to early ‐ to mid ‐ tailbud stage X . laevis frog embryos ( Stages 28 – 30 ) . The embryos developed in this solution for 18 h until they had reached the late tailbud / young tadpole stage ( developmen - tal stages 38 – 42 ) , at which point they were fixed . We then captured dorsal , frontal , and lateral images of control and experimental late tailbud stage X . laevis embryos and measured parameters of the craniofacial and eye tissues ( Figure 3 ) . The CB1R agonist ACEA was applied with ethanol as a vehicle , so we also performed control experiments in which we applied ethanol alone to frog embryos . However , all embryonic features shown here were not significantly different between control untreated and control ethanol conditions , so both ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated embryos were compared to control untreated embryos in Ringers ' solution . Observations and analyses of both dorsal and frontal images of late tailbud stage frog embryos indicated that the craniofacial regions in embryos exposed to either ACEA or AM251 were smaller than those of control embryos ( Figure 3a ) . In dorsal images , perimeters of heads in late tailbud stage embryos that were exposed to ACEA and AM251 were smaller ( 32 % ) than the head perimeters of control frog embryos at this stage ( Figure 3b and Table 2 ) . Mean head area was also decreased ( by 52 % ) by treatment with ACEA and AM251 , relative to control late tailbud stage frog embryos . Frontal images of ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated frog embryos showed analogous changes in craniofacial regions compared to controls . In ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ TABLE 2 Morphometric measurements of craniofacial and eye regions of frog embryos .

The similar magnitudes of decreases in the size of frog embryo craniofacial regions in dorsal and frontal images indicate that ACEA and AM251 uniformly altered head and face morphology in both these orientations . Examination of eyes in lateral images captured of ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated frog embryos suggested that they were also smaller and / or less developed than in control embryos at late tailbud stages ( Figure 3a ) . Approximately half of the experimental embryos ( 56 % of ACEA , 50 % of AM251 embryos ) displayed smaller eyes with open horseshoe morphology ( or with larger gray areas ) , characteristic of younger stage Xenopus embryos ( Figure 3a ) . In contrast , very few control late tailbud stage embryos ( 5 % ) displayed smaller eyes with open horseshoe morphologies ( Figure 3a ) . To better understand the effects of the pharmacological reagents on eye development in Xenopus embryos , we measured the perimeter and areas of the eyes . The mean perimeters of the eyes for ACEA and AM251 experimental embryos were 5 % and 12 % smaller than the mean perimeters of eyes in control embryos , ( Figure 3d and Table 2 ) . The mean areas of the ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated embryos were also decreased by 9 % and 25 % compared to eyes in control embryos ( Figure 3d and Table 2 ) , indicating that AM251 more strongly perturbed eye development than ACEA . In support of this , in many AM251 ‐ treated embryos , the lens did not develop , whereas in both control and ACEA ‐ treated embryos , lenses were present ( Figure 3a ) . These results show that application of both a pharmacological agonist and an inverse agonist of the main CB receptor , CB1R , led to smaller craniofacial regions in tailbud stage X . laevis frog embryos , suggesting that a finely tuned level of signaling through CB1R is required for normal development of the craniofacial region . ACEA and AM251 also resulted in smaller ( microphthalmia ) and less developed ( coloboma horseshoe ‐ shaped ) eyes in developing frog embryos , with the abrogation of CB1R signaling by AM251 inhibiting eye develop - ment more strongly than activation of CB1R signaling by ACEA . 3 . 5 | Myosin II inhibition phenocopies the effects of CB1R activation and inactivation on craniofacial and eye morphogenesis in frog embryos Given that inhibition of nonmuscle Myosin II by Blebbistatin impacted the same parameters of migration of neural crest cells in chicken embryos as treatment with the CB1R agonist ACEA , we next asked whether perturbation of Myosin II signaling activity would also alter craniofacial and eye morphogenesis in frog embryos , similar to ACEA and AM251 . If so , this would support the hypothesis that CB1R signaling impacts craniofacial and eye morphogenesis by regulating actomyosin ‐ based morphological changes and migration of neural crest derivatives . We first observed that craniofacial regions of late tailbud stage frog embryos exposed to Blebbistatin were smaller than those of control embryos , similar to embryos that were treated with CB1R activator ACEA and inactivator AM251 ( Figure 3a ) . In dorsal images of frog embryos treated with Blebbistatin , the mean perimeter and area of the craniofacial regions were 32 % and 53 % smaller than in control embryos , similar to the effects of ACEA and AM251 ( Figure 3b and Table 2 ) . In frontal images of Blebbistatin exposed embryos , the distance between the eyes and the distance between the center of the eyes and the cement glands were also impacted ( Figure 3a ) . For Blebbistatin ‐ treated embryos , the mean distance between the eyes , and between the eyes and cement glands , were 61 % and 35 % less than the same parameters for control embryos ( p < . 05 for both ; Figure 3c and Table 2 ) . Lastly , a large percentage ( 64 % ) of Blebbistatin ‐ treated embryos also showed smaller and open horseshoe ‐ shaped eyes in lateral images , similar to the percentage of experimental frog embryos treated with ACEA and AM251 that showed eye defects ( Figure 3a ) . The mean perimeter and area of eyes in frog embryos treated with the Myosin II inhibitor were 14 % and 25 % smaller than the mean perimeter and area of eyes in control , untreated frog embryos ( Figure 3d and Table 2 ) . Interestingly , in a small percentage ( 5 % ) of Blebbistatin ‐ treated frog embryos , only one eye was reduced in size whereas the other eye was normal sized or even larger than normal ( see Figure 3a ) . This data demonstrates that treatment of frog embryos with the Myosin II inhibitor , Blebbistatin , results in smaller and / or less developed craniofacial eye regions in frog embryos , similar to what we observed following the application of CB1R agonist ACEA and inverse agonist AM251 . 3 . 6 | Melanophore density and morphology are also altered in Xenopus embryos treated with CB1R agonists and antagonists Thus far our data on frog embryos show that the craniofacial regions and eyes are smaller and / or less developed in frog embryos exposed to CB1R agonists and antagonists than in control , untreated frog embryos . In addition , inhibition of nonmuscle Myosin II by application of Blebbistatin induced similar effects on the morphogenesis of the craniofacial and eye tissues of frog embryos as the CB1R reagents . This suggests that the craniofacial and eye phenotypes in ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated frog embryos may result from alterations in actin ‐ based migration and morphogenesis of neural crest cell derivatives during frog embryo development . To address this , we examined whether melanophores — an accessible neural crest ‐ derived cell type — were also altered in experimental late tailbud stage frog embryos . Determining the effects of the CB1R agonist and antagonist ACEA and AM251 on melanophore density and morphology will provide initial insights into the mechanisms of CB1R on neural crest ‐ derived cells in tailbud stage frog embryos . The morphology of melanophores is a reflection of their subcellular pigment distribution ( aggregated or dispersed ) , so any changes in the shape of these cells following treatment with ACEA and AM251 could additionally indicate whether CB1R regulates subcellular transport in this neural crest ‐ derived cell ( Dahora et al . , 2020 ) . MAHOMED ET AL . | 11 of 15 Close examination of dorsal images of late tailbud stage ( Stages 38 – 40 ) frog embryos showed that the pattern of melanophores in the head region was altered by treatment with both the CB1R agonist and antagonist ( Figure 4a ) . The pigment cells overlying the dorsal posterior midbrain ( located in the dura mater of the brain ) were more dense in ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated embryos than in control late tailbud stage frog embryos ( Figure 4a ) . To quantify this phenotype , we calculated the summed areas of all pigment cells overlying the posterior midbrain and normalized this by the total area of the posterior midbrain ( Figure 4a ) . This analysis showed that in control frog embryos , 31 % of the dorsal posterior midbrain area was covered by pigment cells ( SE = 2 . 7 , n = 6 control embryos ; Figure 4c ) . In contrast , in ACEA ‐ treated frog embryos , 53 % of the posterior midbrain was covered by melanophores ( SE = 4 . 8 , n = 5 embryos ; p < . 05 compared to control ) , and in AM251 animals , 38 % of the dorsal posterior midbrain region was covered by pigment cells ( SE = 5 . 4 , n = 5 embryos ; Figure 4c ) . The increased density of pigmentation in the dorsal head of the late tailbud stage frog embryos treated with pharmacological reagents against the CB1R receptor could be due to alterations in the morphology of these cells . Indeed , melanophores in ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated frog embryos appeared more stellate and intercon - nected than melanophores in control frog embryos , which were generally round and punctate ( Figure 4b ) . To quantify the changes in melanophore morphology , we calculated the circularity index for melanophores in control and experimental frog embryos . The mean circularity index for control melanophores was 0 . 9 ( SE = 0 . 05 , n = 278 melanophores ) indicating they were relatively round ( a perfect circle has a circularity of one ; Figure 4c ) . In contrast , the melanophores in ACEA ‐ treated frog embryos had an average circularity index of 0 . 5 ( SE = 0 . 06 , n = 72 melanophores ; p < . 05 compared to control ; Figure 4c ) . In AM251 exposed embryos , the mean circularity for the melanophores was similarly 0 . 5 ( SE = 0 . 06 , n = 121 melanophores ; p < . 05 compared to control ; Figure 4c ) . This analysis indicates that melanophores in the dorsal head region overlying the posterior midbrain are more densely arranged and stellate in morphology in ACEA ‐ or AM251 ‐ treated late tailbud stage frog embryos compared to the melanophores in control embryos . This suggests that CB1R signaling also regulates the migration and morphogenesis of neural crest cell derivatives in developing frog embryos . 4 | DISCUSSION Using pharmacological reagents , we show that normal signaling activity of the main CB receptor , CB1R , is required for neural crest migration and trigeminal ganglion formation in chicken embryos , and for craniofacial and eye morphogenesis and pigment cell patterning and morphology in frog embryos . The effects of disrupting CB1R signaling on neural crest migration and craniofacial and eye morphogenesis were mimicked by inhibition of nonmuscle Myosin II . These findings suggest that CB signaling is required for sequential stages in neural crest migration and morphogenesis in chicken and frog embryos , irrespective of the differential time of onset of expression of CB1R in these two species . Our results also imply that CB1R signals through Myosin II to regulate neural crest migration and craniofacial and eye morphogenesis in both chicken and frog embryos . 4 . 1 | CB receptor type 1 impacts neural crest migration and trigeminal ganglion formation in chicken embryos Results presented here suggest that CB1R signaling is required for normal migration of cranial neural crest cells in chicken embryos . Following the application of a CB1R pharmacological activator , ACEA , cranial neural crest cells in the midbrain of chick embryos migrated erratically , in smaller numbers and in clumps . In contrast , in controls , large numbers of neural crest cells migrated individually across the full area of the midbrain . The clumped , restricted distribution of neural crest cells with overactivated CB signaling suggests that CB1R may normally regulate cell ‐ to ‐ cell adhesion between neural crest cells , and thereby crest migration . This is the first study to demonstrate that CB signaling is required for the migration of neural crest cells in any type of embryo in vivo . Accordingly , this defines a novel function for CB1R in a significant cellular process during an intermediate developmental stage of embryogenesis . Although no previous studies have shown that CB signaling is required for neural crest migration , reports demonstrated that CB signaling regulates the migration of cells during earlier embryonic developmental stages . Tight regulation of CB signaling was required for spiral artery trophoblast giant cells to appropriately invade the maternal mesometrial pole during placentation ( Xie et al . , 2012 ) . CB1R has also been shown to modulate cell motility and morphology in pathological contexts . In cultured glioblastoma cells , CBs caused an abnormal distribution of actin cytoskeletal elements and , as a result , an abnormal cell shape ( Hohmann et al . , 2019 ) . Overactivation of the endocannabinoid signaling also suppressed the migration of metastatic breast cancer cells ( Qamri et al . , 2009 ) . The formation of the trigeminal ganglion and nerve requires epithelial ‐ to ‐ mesenchymal transition , migration , condensation , neu - ronal differentiation , and mixing and adhesion of both trigeminal placode cells and cranial neural crest cells ( Shiau et al . , 2008 ) . Those processes , and their underlying molecular regulations ( Gammill et al . , 2007 ; McCabe et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2017 ; Wu & Taneyhill , 2019 ) , seem to be relatively undisturbed in ACEA ‐ and AM251 ‐ treated embryos , since the trigeminal ganglia do form ( Figure 2 ) and their lobes show normal morphometric parameters ( perimeter , area , length , and circularity ) . Moreover , expression of the neuronal marker Tuj1 by the trigeminal ganglia suggests that differentiation is not impacted by the disruption of the CB pathway . These results support the notion that the endocannabinoid system does not play a role in gangliogenesis . 12 of 15 | MAHOMED ET AL . However , overactivation of CB1R with ACEA prevented , or at least delayed , nerve projection in the majority of ophthalmic lobes of the trigeminal ganglia in chick embryos , as evidenced by a shorter ophthalmic lobe with nerve . This result is reminiscent of the aberrant nerve projection from the optic nerve in frog embryos treated with ACEA ( Elul et al . , 2022 ) or disoriented axonal processes from cortical neurons in the mouse and the Rhesus monkey ( Morozov et al . , 2020 ) . AM251 treatment caused the trigeminal nerve to form more posteriorly than expected , closer to the otic pit . This hints to a caudal displacement of the trigeminal placode , a key player in trigeminal morphogenesis ( Shiau et al . , 2008 ) . As a result of this caudal slippage , the ophthalmic nerve projected to the eye at a more acute angle , accounting for the smaller circularity value . It is noteworthy that the ophthalmic nerve did reach the eye region by HH18 , suggesting that axonal extension may have occurred at an increased rate in AM251 , to bridge the larger distance to the eye in the same amount of time as controls . Furthermore , AM251 ophthalmic nerve was often overly defasciculated , showing mis - targeted axons ( Figure 2e ) . Supporting our in vivo results , another group showed that explanted trigeminal ganglia exposed to AM251 had mistargeted axons that turned back to innervate the midbrain ( Watson et al . , 2008 ) . Lastly , the maxillomandibular lobe and nerve in trigeminal ganglia were generally less affected than its ophthalmic counterpart , likely because nerve formation has not progressed very far by HH18 . Interestingly , there seems to be a right – left discrepancy in our results , with the ophthalmic or maxillomandibular lobes on the right side of the embryo being affected , while near ‐ normal development occurs on the left side , with both pharmacological treatments . Although we are unclear about the possible left – right mechanism , we note that CB1R expression displays a left – right asymmetric expres - sion in gastrulating chick embryos in the node ( Psychoyos et al . , 2012 ) by HH8 , and this may underpin the later differences in right versus left ganglionic nerve morphogenesis . 4 . 2 | CB1R impacts craniofacial and eye morphogenesis and pigmentation pattern in X . laevis frog embryos Our results also demonstrate that signaling of CB type 1 receptor , CB1R , influences and is required for normal craniofacial and eye morphogenesis in tailbud stage embryos of X . laevis frogs . Both pharmacological activation and inactivation of CB1R signaling led to smaller and / or less developed craniofacial complexes and eye regions in frog embryos . These findings confirm and extend the results of earlier studies that examined the impacts of cannabis and manipula - tion of CB signaling on the development of craniofacial and eye regions in embryos of other species . In early studies , cannabis injection into pregnant rabbits , rats , and guinea pigs , resulted in altered craniofacial and eye regions of the developing fetuses ( Persaud & Ellington , 1968 ) . In later studies , ingestion of THC or a synthetic “ herbal spice ” CB by pregnant mice induced craniofacial and eye defects in mouse fetuses , such as micrognathia ( small jaws ) and facial clefts , as well as microphthalmia ( smaller eyes ) , iridial coloboma and anopthalmia ( lack of eyes ; Bloch et al . , 1986 ; Gilbert et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , in zebrafish , waterborne exposure of animals to CBD and THC led to eye and snout defects ( Carty et al . , 2018 ) . Finally , the knockdown of the CB1R receptor in X . laevis cleavage stage embryos resulted in reduced eyes at late tailbud stages ( Zheng et al . , 2015 ) . Extending from these studies , our results are the first to show that both activation and inactivation of the CB receptor , CB1R , induce similar craniofacial and eye defects in one type of embryo . This suggests that tight homeostatic regulation of CB1R is required for normal craniofacial and eye morphogenesis in developing frog embryos . The data presented here suggest that CB1R is also required for proper patterning and morphology of melanophores ( neural crest cell derivatives ) overlying the posterior midbrain in the dorsal head of tailbud stage frog embryos . Both the agonist and antagonist for the CB receptor resulted in a denser distribution of melanophores , with the CB1R agonist more strongly increasing melanophore density . In addition , melanophores in frog embryos treated with ACEA and AM251 were more stellate in morphology compared to melano - phores in control frog embryos . Similar to neural crest cells in chicken embryos which showed a more clumped distribution following perturbation of CB1R signaling , the increase in melanophore density in frog embryos with pharmacological treatments against CB1R may result from an alteration of cell ‐ to ‐ cell adhesion ( Elul et al . , 2022 ) . In addition , the morphology of melanophores is thought to reflect their subcellular distribution of melanin ( aggregated or dispersed ; Dahora et al . , 2019 ) . Melanin is transported through the melanophores via melanosomes in an acto ‐ myosin ‐ dependent manner ( Dahora et al . , 2019 ) . Accordingly , the more stellate morphology of melanophores observed in frog embryos following modifications of CB1R signaling could , in turn , reflect increased dispersion of melanin in these cells due to alterations in acto ‐ myosin ‐ based transport processes . 4 . 3 | Myosin II exerts shared mechanisms with CB1R in the regulation of cranial neural crest migration and craniofacial and eye morphogenesis The application of Blebbistatin , a nonmuscle Myosin II inhibitor , impacted cranial neural crest cell migration in an opposite manner to ACEA , the CB1R agonist . By HH14 , in embryos exposed to ACEA or Blebbistatin , cranial neural crest cells had migrated significantly less far than their counterparts in control embryos . In addition , cranio - facial and eye morphogenesis were similarly impacted by Blebbistatin as by both the CB1R activator ACEA and inactivator AM251 . Treatment with Blebbistatin resulted in smaller and misshapen craniofacial regions and reduced eye regions as did ACEA and AM251 . Together , these results suggest that signaling of CBs through CB1R may regulate the activity of nonmuscle Myosin II to modulate neural crest migration from the neural tube in chicken embryos and migratory or morphogenetic processes of neural crest derivatives MAHOMED ET AL . | 13 of 15 that are required for craniofacial and eye morphogenesis in frog embryos . Other researchers have shown that CB1R , a G ‐ protein coupled receptor , signals through ROCK and Rho to regulate Myosin II activity in the growth cone motility of a developing neuronal circuit ( Roland et al . , 2014 ) . A similar molecular mechanism may be involved in the CB1R regulation of Myosin II to promote neural crest and derivative migration and morphogenesis in chicken and frog embryos . 5 | CONCLUSIONS We show that in chicken and frog embryos , sequential steps of neural crest cell migration and differentiation are perturbed by alterations in CB signaling . The time of onset of expression of CB1R is significantly earlier in chick ( G . gallus , during neurulation ) than in frog embryos ( X . laevis , at early tailbud stage ) . Accordingly , our results suggest that CB1R impacts the migration and morphogenesis of neural crest cells and neural crest derivatives through all developmental stages , in these different classes of animals . This data advances our under - standing of the functions of CB signaling on neural crest migration and differentiation of neural crest ‐ derived structures during embryo - nic development .
