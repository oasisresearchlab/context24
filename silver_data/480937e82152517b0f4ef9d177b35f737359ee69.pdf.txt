The effectiveness of new combinations with knowledge from different technical ﬁelds through the quantitative analysis of patent data related to NetZero Masayuki Hirose * Ph . D . Program , Graduate School of Business Administration , Hitotsubashi University , Tokyo , Japan This study showcases a technique to categorize NetZero - related patent applications into three technical ﬁelds according to the degree of proximity between claimed inventions and cited inventions by comparing technological classiﬁcations between the patent applications and cited applications thereof . In this technique , the author ﬁrst describes the existing methods used in previous studies . The technique proposed in this article is different from those of previous studies in that it is characterized by comparing the technical ﬁelds of not only the primary classiﬁcation but also the subsequent classiﬁcations . This is made possible by using two patent classiﬁcations without having a speciﬁc classiﬁcation corresponding to the middle hierarchy in between , rather than using three patent classiﬁcations with different hierarchies . This technique reduces the possibility that two applications , even if they are the same in their subsequent classiﬁcation , will be judged as applications in different technical ﬁelds because they are in different classes in the primary classiﬁcation . Using the proposed technique , the author examined the impact on the subsequent patent application of NetZero - related patent applications ﬁled in Japan . As a result of the analysis , the author found that approximately 33 % of subject applications , whose technical ﬁeld differs from the backward citations when comparing the primary classiﬁcation only , match one of the subsequent classiﬁcations when comparing them in consideration of the subsequent classiﬁcations as well . The author then found that these 33 % of subject applications had a greater impact on subsequent patent applications than the remaining applications .

NetZero refers to a state in which the greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal from the atmosphere . Achievement of NetZero is necessary to prevent further global warming because global warming is considered to be interlinked with climate change . In the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 26 ) held in November 2021 , the participating countries proposed an action to reduce emissions . The eﬀorts for NetZero in Japan have already started 30 years ago . Fujii and Managi ( 2016 ) reported that more than 10 , 000 patent applications related to environmental protection technology have been ﬁled every year since the 1990s with the increasing demands of the market and society for environmental protection and mitigation of climate change ( Fujii and Managi , 2016 , p . 4 ) . Furthermore , the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 spurred this trend of patent applications , and this trend seemed to continue . The OECD ( 2015 ) indicates that Japan has led the world in high - value invention in environmental technology ( Fujii and Shirakawa , 2015 , p . 3 ; Hašˇciˇci and Migotto , 2015 , p . 27 – 35 ) . However , after 2009 , when the global ﬁnancial crisis arising from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers began to aﬀect Japan , the number of Japanese patent applications gradually decreased until around 2015 . Figure 1 is a graph showing changes in the number of Japanese patent applications in which “carbon neutral” and its related terms 1 are described in the speciﬁcation of patent applications ﬁled over the 25 years from 1995 to 2020 . As can be seen from this graph , the number of applications has declined since peaking around 2009 and has been almost ﬂat since around 2015 2 . COP21 was held in 2021 against a background of 1 Thekeywordsusedinthesearchareasfollows . Theactualsearchformula was prepared using Japanese keywords . “carbon neutral + global warming + de - carbonization + de - carbonizing + de - plasticization + COP26 + United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change + net - zero emission + zero carbon emissions” . 2 Although the annual number of patent application ﬁled in Japan has remained at a high level of around 400 , 000 until 2008 , the number of total patent applications in Japan decreased by 10 . 8 % from 2008 to 2009 and has been gradually decreasing thereafter ( see , e . g . , JPO Annual Report , 2012 , international interest in environmental issues rising again . The Japanese government took this opportunity to declare in October 2020 that Japan would realize carbon neutrality by 2050 , and , in April 2021 , the government set a very ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 46 % by 2030 . Coping with the issue of global warming has become one of the most important tasks for companies as well . In Japan , the public and private sectors are currently working together to develop new technologies for NetZero . Achieving the goals set by the Paris Agreement will require innovation that brings more change . To address this challenge , the author focuses on two long - standing concepts in innovation . One is that recombination is one of the processes that leads to new innovations ( Shumpeter , 1934 ; Nelson and Winter , 1982 ; Hargadon and Sutton , 1997 ) . Schumpeter identiﬁed ﬁve cases of new combinations . 3 The other is that important innovation involves the transfer of knowledge from one technical ﬁeld to another . Fleming ( 2001 ) suggested that new combinations of distant knowledge may give rise to a path - breaking innovation . Miller et al . ( 2007 ) stated that obtaining a remote source of knowledge is important to revitalize existing knowledge and develop new capabilities . There are many studies suggesting that the use of distant knowledge leads to the development of breakthrough inventions ( e . g . , Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ; Katila and Ahuja , 2002 ) . By combining technological components from more distant technological domains , the degree of novelty goes up ( Keijl et al . , 2016 ) . However , with a further increase in novelty through the inclusion of components from more distant technological domains , the familiarity of the invention will commonly decrease as compared with combining within the same technical domain and building on existing knowledge ( Shane , 2000 ) . Fu et al . ( 2013 ) , who examined the eﬀect of the distance of such analogical design stimuli as “near” and “far” on design solution generation , showed that if the stimuli are too distant , they can become harmful to the design process . The use of “distant knowledge” has also been discussed in the context of corporate search in comparison to local knowledge ( e . g . , March , 1991 ; Rosenkopf and Almeida , 2003 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Local search is deﬁned as knowledge search in closely related , familiar , and similar technical areas , whereas distant search is deﬁned as a search for knowledge across diverse technical areas beyond the familiar technical area ( March and Simon , 1958 ; Nelson and Winter , 1982 ; Stuart and Podolny , 1996 ; Rosenkopf and Nerkar , 2001 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Distant search , in contrast to local knowledge , makes it possible to acquire new and external knowledge from distant technical ﬁelds ( Tushman , 1977 ) . Part 1 , p12 , Fig . 1 - 1 - 1 ; JPO Status Report , 2022 , Part 1 , Chapter 1 , p3 , Figs . 1 - 1 - 4 ) . Fujii and Managi ( 2016 , p . 15 ) pointed out that the main reason for this dramatic decline is the economic recession triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 . 3 Schumpeter identiﬁed ﬁve cases of new combinations : “ ( 1 ) The introduction of a new good—or of a new quality of a good . ( 2 ) The introduction of a new method of production… ( 3 ) The opening of new market… ( 4 ) The conquest of a new source of supply of raw materials or half manufactured goods… ( 5 ) The carrying out of new organization of any industry… . ” ( Shumpeter , 1934 , p . 66 ) . FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 02 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 On the other hand , it has also been pointed out that the accumulated capabilities of ﬁrms can limit the scope of searches and their ability to understand and apply new knowledge ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ; Miller et al . , 2007 ) . It has been also pointed out that barriers to the search and transfer of knowledge across organizational boundaries arise from the accumulated competencies of ﬁrms and the cognitive constraints of individuals ( Walsh , 1995 ; Miller et al . , 2007 ) and shared routines developed from the unique histories of organizations ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ; Leonard - Barton , 1992 ; Garud and Rappa , 1994 , Tripsas and Gavetti , 2000 ) . 4 Furthermore , recently , in addition to the well - known concepts of incremental and radical innovations , there is an idea to focus on adjacent innovations between them . Nagji and Tuﬀ ( 2012 , p . 4 ) who proposed this idea mentioned that “adjacent innovation” involves leveraging something established ﬁrms do well into a new area . The “adjacent innovation” is considered to be in line with a series of movements that have been attracting attention in Japan in recent years , in which Companies cross industry boundaries and enter various ﬁelds . They try to cultivate new ﬁelds by taking advantage of their own strengths in diﬀerent ﬁelds . 5 To make such an innovation that addresses the issue of global warming and promotes NetZero , should R & D managers refer to a more distant technical ﬁeld ? ( Research Question ) . In tackling this research question , the author believed that it would be useful to consider the concept of “adjacent innovation” as well . In other words , the author thought it would be beneﬁcial not only to divide a series of patent applications into two technical ﬁelds , namely , the “same” technical ﬁeld and the “distant” technical ﬁeld but also to consider and analyze the technical ﬁelds located in the “neighboring ﬁelds” . With this in mind , the author looked at previous literature showing previous methods of categorizing patent applications into 4 For example , Walsh ( 1995 ) pointed out that knowledge structures can restrict opportunities to acquire new knowledge and limit an individual’s ability to comprehend information . In addition , focusing on core capabilities , Leonard - Barton ( 1992 ) pointed out the existence of core rigidities behind them . Tripsas and Gavetti ( 2000 ) found that the beliefs and dominant logic that Polaroid has accumulated in the past have created structural inertia , which has become a factor that hinders adaptation to technological change . 5 For example , Fujiﬁlm Corporation , a manufacturer of cameras and ﬁlm , entered the cosmetics ﬁeld in 2006 by paying attention to the similarity between ﬁlm and skin , both of which are composed of mainly collagen . Idemitsu Kosan applied technology that had been cultivated in petrochemicals to a light - emitting material for organic EL , realizing high - efficiency , long - life pure blue light emission ( commonly known as “Idemitsu Blue” ) , which was considered the most difficult to develop at the time . In another case , Seiko Epson has redeﬁned the inkjet technology accumulated in the printer business as a micro liquid process technology and entered the organic EL display business using industrial production technology . In addition , Nitto Denko has been working on the development of “transdermal medication patches” , which are medical formulations , by making use of its advanced technological capabilities related to “adhesion technology” cultivated with adhesives . All of these cases have in common that they strive to develop new technology in different ﬁelds by making use of their own strengths . three technical ﬁelds . However , some common issues were found in the existing methods : since they focus on the primary patent classiﬁcation when comparing the technical ﬁelds of backward citations , the problem remains that even if the primary patent classiﬁcations are diﬀerent from each other , it is not possible to distinguish the possibility of matching one of the subsequent classiﬁcations . Therefore , to solve the problem raised earlier in this article , the author proposed a method of categorizing a set of patent applications into three technical ﬁelds according to the degree of proximity between claimed inventions and cited inventions ( backward citations ) . This article proceeds as follows . After reviewing the previous studies that categorize patent applications into three technical ﬁelds using the classiﬁcation of cited applications ( backward citations ) , the author addresses issues common to the previous methods in Section Previous literature . Next , after deriving a hypothesis in Section Hypothesis , the author showcases how the proposed technique works in Section Proposed measurement method , and describes the data and methods for analysis in Section Data and method for analysis . After testing the hypothesis in Section Results , the author discusses the analysis results in Section Discussion . Finally , the author presents the conclusion of this study in Section Conclusion with limitations and suggests future research directions . Previous literature There is one natural way to examine the technological proximity between a patent and its citations by using the technical classiﬁcations listed on them , the value of which was suggested by Trajtenberg et al . ( 1997 ) and has been shown to be useful for assessing the nature and impact of inventions for patent applications ( Fleming , 2001 ; Hall et al . , 2001 ; Harrigan et al . , 2017 ) . Trajtenberg et al . ( 1997 ) constructed a methodology for measuring the technical distance between a patent and its citations using a hierarchical structure of the U . S . patent classiﬁcation system that consisted of three - digit patent classes , two - digit categories , and six very broad ﬁelds . Applying this methodology , they attempted to compare the “originality” of universities and companies . On the contrary , this methodology can be applied to indicate ﬂows of knowledge from each cited patent to each focal patent . Next , the author focuses on previous studies that categorize the distance between the focal patent and its cited patents into three categories using backward citations and the patent classiﬁcation . A representative study is conducted by Nemet and Johnson ( 2012 ) . Previous literature on analyzing knowledge streams from three technology domains Nemet and Johnson ( 2012 ) referred to each citation from a focal patent to a previous patent as a citation pair and measured knowledge ﬂowing from one technical domain to another by comparing , for each pair , the technical classiﬁcation assigned to each cited patent with classiﬁcation for the citing patent . They axiomatically categorize each patent – citation pair into three categories by comparing their classiﬁcations at each level in the FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 03 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 hierarchy . For example , a pair is coded as “near” if they are in the same sub - class ; a pair is set as “internal” if they are in the same class ; a pair is set as “external” if they are in diﬀerent classes ; and a pair is set as “far external” if they are in diﬀerent super - classes . This coding scheme is used to develop three variables using counts of backward citation pairs for each patent : far external , external , and near ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 13 ) . They minimized truncation bias by imposing a 10 - year window on both forward and backward citations so that each patent has a similar weight ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 10 ) . The results of the measurements showed signiﬁcant eﬀect in the two most highly cited individual technology categories . They found that external citations had a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect on forward citations for the category of computers and communications ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 26 ) . They also found that external citations were much less eﬀective than other types of citations for the category of medical and drugs . The coeﬃcient for far external was not actually negative , but the ratio comparing it to other citations was very small ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 26 ) . Conversely , for these most highly cited individual technologies , citing technically closer prior art had a stronger eﬀect than far citations ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 28 ) . Their explanation does not explicitly state that they used not only the primary classiﬁcation but also the subsequent classiﬁcations . However , the phrase “our eﬀort to use only high - level classes to compare results across multiple classiﬁcation systems” ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 30 ) is considered to imply that only primary classiﬁcations were used . They also count the total number of patents that the patent cites to deﬁne the citations made ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 12 ) . By using counts of backward citation pairs for each patent together with the abovementioned coding scheme , they developed three variables ( far external i , external i , and near i ) ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 13 ) . The counts of backward citation pairs are also used to compute the counts of other citations . Therefore , it is considered that the number of backward citations is taken into account in the development of these three variables . It is also understood , from Figure 2 and Table 1 provided by them , that “super - class” corresponds to “Section” in the case of the IPC . In addition , it is understood , from the coding scheme , that the pair coded as “far external” is used as the primary indicator of external knowledge ﬂow and , thus , the IPC’s eight sections correspond to “far external” . Nemet ( 2012 ) used the same method of measurement as Nemet and Johnson ( 2012 ) , but in contrast to them , he showed that for energy technologies the integration of technologically distant prior art ( i . e . , distant knowledge ) has a stronger positive eﬀect on knowledge ﬂows than the integration of technologically near prior art ( i . e . , local knowledge ) . He found that coeﬃcients on external citations were positive and signiﬁcantly larger than those for other types of citations in the analysis of energy patents , whereas coeﬃcients on citations to prior art that is technologically near have a negative eﬀect on forward citation frequency ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 1268 ) . However , he found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between external citations and other citations in the analysis of all other patents including highly cited areas such as computers and medical patents , except for the category of electrical and electronics , which partially overlaps with energy technology ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 1268 ) . The energy technologies he FIGURE2 Hierarchical structure of classiﬁcation . targeted for patent analysis were deﬁned according to the list of energy patent classes in Popp and Newell ( 2009 , p . 1261 ) . Keijl et al . ( 2016 ) also measured the three knowledge ﬂows from local , adjacent , and distant domains . They tracked recombination patterns in biotechnology patent applications by weighting the number of backward citations with their relative distance from a patent’s focal domain . Although they showed that an intermediate level of recombination had the highest impact , the concept of “an intermediate level of recombination” they used is diﬀerent from the concept of the combination with technologies in the neighboring ﬁelds referred to in this article . Rather , it should be noted that the concept refers to a combination of local and distant domains or a combination of near - adjacent and distant technologies ( Keijl et al . , 2016 , p . 35 ) . They argued that “an intermediate level of recombination” consisting of these combinations had the highest impact because it combines both novelty and familiarity ( Keijl et al . , 2016 , p . 35 , 36 ) . The technological distance between a sampled patent and its cited patents was determined as follows : when they are assigned to one of the three - digit biotechnology classes , this citation is categorized as a “near” citation . When the backward - cited patent is not assigned to a three - digit biotechnology class , but assigned to another class within “chemicals” or “drugs and medical” , both of which were some of the categories aggregated by Hall et al . ( 2001 ) , this citation is categorized as an “adjacent” citation . When the backward - cited patent is not assigned to the “chemicals” or “drugs and medical” category , this citation is categorized as a “distant” citation . Next , the level of recombination was calculated by attaching diﬀerent weights , respectively , to the three kinds of citations with near citations as “1” , adjacent citations as “2” , and distant citations as “3” . The sum of these weighted backward citations is then divided by the number of backward citations ( Hall et al . , 2001 , p . 22 ) . They were aware that patents could be assigned to multiple patent classes , but only considered the number of patent classes as a controlling variable in their regression models . They controlled cross - reference classes other than the primary patent class used for the sampling strategy . This is because they viewed multiple FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 04 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 TABLE 1 Top 50 NetZero - related technical ﬁelds .

Therefore , this is diﬀerent from the aim of this article to consider not only the primary classiﬁcation but also the subsequent classiﬁcations of patents in order to analyze knowledge ﬂows from other technical ﬁelds ( Hall et al . , 2001 , p . 26 ) . Need for modiﬁed measurement methods of patent content proximity All of the previous studies discussed earlier have simultaneously considered multiple levels of technological aggregation . However , there is still room for further improvement in existing measurement methods when analyzing patent data using patent classiﬁcation and citation information . The issue is that when comparing the technical ﬁelds of backward citations , only the primary patent classiﬁcation assigned to them was considered and not the subsequent listed patent classes . Even if the primary classiﬁcations are diﬀerent , there are many backward citations that the subsequent classiﬁcations have in common . As previous methods focus on only the primary patent classiﬁcations assigned to patents , the challenge remains that two patents common to any of the subsequent classiﬁcations assigned to the patents cannot be distinguished even if the primary patent classiﬁcations are diﬀerent . After this problem was pointed out in other contexts by Thompson and Fox - Kean ( 2005 ) 6 and Benner and Waldfogel ( 2008 ) , subsequent studies began to consider the use of additional classiﬁcations beyond the primary classiﬁcation in order to reduce 6 Although the context is different , a similar indication was made by Thompson and Fox - Kean ( 2005 ) regarding Jaffe et al . ( 1993 ) , which found a corresponding “control” patent issued in the same primary U . S . patent class as the citing patent . FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 06 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 this problem in other measurement contexts ( e . g . , McNamee , 2013 ; Aharonson and Schilling , 2016 ; Kuhn , 2017 ) . This is a problem that could commonly occur in the International Patent Classiﬁcation ( “IPC” ) as well as the U . S . patent classiﬁcation ( “UPC” ) . As technology has become more complicated , there are many patent applications in which the two inventions diﬀer in the ﬁrst classiﬁcation but match in the subsequent classiﬁcations . Hypothesis Here , the author would like to return to the research question posed in Section Introduction . To make such innovation that addresses the issue of global warming and promotes NetZero , should R & D managers refer to a more distant technical ﬁeld as many existing studies emphasize ? The author believes that subsequent patent classiﬁcations , like the primary patent classiﬁcation , have some impact on subsequent patent applications . Then , it is considered that the results of the analysis considering the subsequent patent classiﬁcations shift the peak from the distant ﬁeld to the neighboring ﬁeld compared to the results of using only the primary patent classiﬁcations . Therefore , the author sets the following hypothesis . Hypothesis : There is a mountain - shaped relationship ( an inverted U - shaped relationship ) between the patent proximity between claimed invention and cited invention and the impact of the subject application on subsequent applications . In the next section , the author describes the proposed technique of this article , which makes it possible to consider the subsequent patent classiﬁcations . Proposed measurement method In this section , the author explains how the methodological challenges discussed in the ﬁrst section are solved by the technique proposed in this article . Methodology for judging the incorporation of technologies from other ﬁelds using backward citations and patent classiﬁcation To identify patent applications for inventions incorporating knowledge in diﬀerent technical ﬁelds , the author focuses on the possibility that “at least one” of the cited applications ( backward citations ) cited in the examination may be in a diﬀerent technical ﬁeld from the subject matter of the invention claimed in the subject patent application in the case that the invention incorporates technologies from other ﬁelds . This is based on the premise that the patent classiﬁcation represents the subject matter of the claimed invention ( Tsunoda , 2016 , p . 267 ) . This is not limited to Japan but is commonly seen in patent examinations overseas as well . For example , Shane ( 2001 ) stated the following regarding the relationship between claimed inventions of U . S . patents and patent classiﬁcations assigned thereto : “The assignment of a patent to a particular patent class represents the U . S . Patent and Trademark Oﬃce’s ( USPTO’s ) assessment that the patent belongs in a particular technical ﬁeld . Patent examiners also determine what previous inventions must be cited in a patent by searching prior patents . Because patents belong to technical classes and because they cite previous patents , citations to patents in particular technical ﬁelds represent the USPTO’s assessment that a particular invention builds upon ( cites ) knowledge in that technical ﬁeld . When a patent cites previous patents in classes other than the ones it is in , that pattern suggests that the invention builds upon diﬀerent technical paradigms from the one in which it is applied . ” ( Shane , 2001 , p . 210 ) What should be taken into consideration here is that inventions often consist of multiple technologies and that two or more patent classiﬁcations are often assigned to one patent application ( Tsunoda , 2016 , p . 266 ) . Therefore , according to the proposed technique , all patent classiﬁcations assigned to the present application ( including the primary classiﬁcation and the subsequent classiﬁcations ) are compared with all patent classiﬁcations assigned to its backward citations . Thus , it is checked whether there is “at least one” of the applications ( backward citations ) cited in the examination that is assigned a patent classiﬁcation diﬀerent from the patent classiﬁcation assigned to the present application . If there is such a backward citation , the hierarchical structure of the patent classiﬁcations is used to categorize the degree of proximity between the present invention and the cited application into three levels : “same , ” “neighboring , ” and “distant” . Furthermore , to characterize the proximities in the technological space deﬁned by the classiﬁcation scheme , the patent classiﬁcation must be a ruler that reﬂects the state of the current technology and shows a hierarchical structure with an appropriate number of classiﬁcations between layers . To achieve this , the author proposes to combine two existing technical classiﬁcations , which are explained later . IPC - based aggregated technology classiﬁcation In the measurement technique proposed in this article , the Aggregated Technology Classiﬁcation ( “ATC” ) based on the IPC is also used . This is described as one of the classiﬁcation systems used in the WIPO statistical reports and matched to top - level categories in the NBER Patent Database with six technology types ( Goto and Motohashi , 2005 , p . 46 ; Goto and Motohashi , 2007 , p . 1433 ) . The IPC classiﬁcation table is a set of classiﬁcation items and has a structure in which all technical ﬁelds are arranged in a hierarchical , tree - like structure in diﬀerent levels with codes , including sections , classes , and subclasses . In this article , the author proposes to use ATC , which does not have its own hierarchical structure , in combination with the IPC . There are two reasons for this . First , the ATC has an appropriate measurement range divided into 33 ﬁelds , as can be seen in Figure 2 , which is narrower in its focus than the section level of the IPC with 8 sections and wider in FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 07 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 its focus than the class level of the IPC with 118 classes . Second , the classiﬁcation of the ATC is closer to the current state of technology than the IPC . These reasons are supplemented with a comparative table ( refer to Appendix I ) that shows the relationship between the ATC and the IPC . In the table , the ATC technical ﬁeld numbers ( “ATC Nos” ) . One to Thirty - three are shown on the left , and the corresponding IPC sections and subclasses are shown on the right . In this table , pharmaceutical products ( A61K ) , which are classiﬁed into IPC Section A representing Human Necessities together with Agricultural and Marine Products ( A01 ) and pesticides / herbicides ( A01N ) , are indistinguishable from them at the level of IPC section . In addition , enzymes ( C12N9 / ) and genetic engineering ( C12N15 / ) are classiﬁed together into the subclass C12N that represents microorganisms , and it is not possible to distinguish between the two at the subclass level . While genetic engineering is a state - of - the - art technology that is often subject to analysis , enzymes are essential technologies for food and medicine that produce Koji , yeast , and lactic - acid bacteria . Koji is the “national fungus of Japan” that is indispensable for fermenting sake , producing miso , soy sauce , and a whole range of traditional Japanese foods . In this way , the hierarchical structure of the IPC does not necessarily reﬂect the current state of the art in Japan . 7 In contrast , the ATC has an independent classiﬁcation for pharmaceuticals ( No . 5 ) and separate classiﬁcations for biotechnology ( No . 16 ) and genetic engineering ( No . 17 ) . Therefore , the ATC is more reﬂect the current state of technology than other classiﬁcations . It is neither too broad like IPC sections nor too detailed like IPC classes . The proposed technique exempliﬁes the combination of the ATC and the IPC as classiﬁcations in diﬀerent layers , but it is not limited to this combination . Rather , the feature to be emphasized is , instead of using three patent classiﬁcations with diﬀerent hierarchies as in previous studies , the use of only two classiﬁcations consisting of the broadest patent class and the narrowest class . In the proposed technique , instead of using a speciﬁc classiﬁcation corresponding to the middle layer , the target applications can be categorized into three technical ﬁelds by considering not only the primary classiﬁcation but also the subsequent classiﬁcations . This point is a feature of the proposed technique . Although the author chooses the ATC and the ITC as the optimal combination for analyzing current technology in Japan , the combination can be changed depending on the times and the technology , and thus two classiﬁcations with appropriate spacing and hierarchical structure may be selected . Proposed measurement technique Using the hierarchical structure of the primary classiﬁcation and subsequent classiﬁcations given to patent applications , the author explains the proposed technique of categorizing a set 7 Similar examples are found in the case of “Insecticides / Herbicides ( IPC’s Class A01N ) ” classiﬁed as ATC No . 13 in combination with organic chemistry ( IPC Class C07 ) as well as the case of Explosives ( IPC Class C06 ) , which is separated from Chemistry ( IPC Section C ) and transferred to ATC No . 26 ( Weapons and Explosives ) . FIGURE3 Three categories of subject applications depending on technical ﬁelds of backward citations . of patent applications into three technical ﬁelds by comparing technological classiﬁcations between patent applications for an invention examined by an examiner ( “Subject Application” ) and prior applications cited by an examiner in the examination of subject application ( “Backward Citations” ) . Explanation of hypothetical examples Figure 3 shows hypothetical examples for explaining the measurement technique proposed in this article . In this ﬁgure , combinations of subject applications with three backward citations are shown as three patterns A – C . Each subject application is classiﬁed as ATC No . 7 , which corresponds to the primary IPC classiﬁcation assigned to each subject application . In contrast , the ATC classiﬁcation of backward citations diﬀers for each subject application . All backward citations of Pattern A are classiﬁed as the same ATC No . 7 as the subject application . For Patterns B and C , two of the three backward citations are classiﬁed as the same ATC No . 7 as subject application , but one backward citation is assigned a diﬀerent ATC classiﬁcation from its subject application . The diﬀerence between the ATC No . 3 and No . 5 classiﬁcation numbers does not make much sense here , and it is suﬃcient if they are diﬀerent from the ATC classiﬁcation of the subject application ( No . 7 in this pattern ) . Rather , the point to be emphasized here is that in Pattern B , any one of the IPC subclasses of the backward citation ( ATC No . 3 in this pattern ) matches any of the IPC subclasses of subject application , whereas in Pattern C , the IPC subclass of backward citation ( ATC No . 5 in this pattern ) does not match any of the IPC subclasses of the subject application . In summary , the diﬀerences between the three patterns are as follows . Pattern A is diﬀerent from Patterns B and C in that the ATC Nos of all backward citations are the same as those of the subject application . Patterns B and C , in contrast , are similar in that at least one ATC No . of a backward citation diﬀers from that of the subject application . However , Patterns B and C can be distinguished by comparing not only the primary classiﬁcation but also the subsequent classiﬁcations . FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 08 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 FIGURE4 Flow chart of two - ﬁltering processes . According to the technique proposed in this article , the group data of a subject application can be categorized into the three patterns by comparing a subject application and its citations using two patent classiﬁcations with diﬀerent hierarchies . Figure 4 shows the ﬂowchart of the proposed technique . This ﬁgure shows a two - stage ﬁltering process that compares a subject application and its backward citations using diﬀerent hierarchies of patent classiﬁcations . The upper half of the ﬁgure shows the ﬁrst ﬁltering process using the ATC No . corresponding to the primary classiﬁcation of the IPC subclass assigned in each application , and the lower half shows the second ﬁltering process using subclasses of the IPC classiﬁcation . In the second ﬁltering , not only the primary classiﬁcation but also all IPC classiﬁcations ( including subsequent classiﬁcations ) assigned to each application are targeted for comparison . Extraction of subject applications falling into the same ﬁeld First , the ﬁrst ﬁltering process extracts subject applications one by one from a set of patent applications and compares subject applications and backward citations ( usually multiple ) with the ATC . Speciﬁcally , as shown in the upper half of Figure 4 , comparisons are made using the ATC No . assigned to each application , and if they match ( that is , if the judgment of “non - coincidence” is “No” ) , subject application is categorized into the Same Field . In contrast , if the comparison reveals at least one unmatched backward citation ( that is , if the judgment of “non - coincidence” is “Yes” ) , analysis of the subject application can proceed to the second ﬁltering process . This ﬁrst ﬁltering process may be done by analyzing with MySQL using the citation data of the IIP patent database . 8 8 It may be necessary to separately create an ATC table corresponding to the data of the IPC subclass in order to perform the ﬁltering process because the ATC Nos information has been excluded from the IIP Patent Database since the data were extracted on August 31 , 2017 ( for unknown reasons ) . Distinguishing between subject applications falling into neighboring and distant ﬁelds Next , the second ﬁltering process is conducted for the set of applications extracted in the ﬁrst ﬁltering process . The second ﬁltering process is performed , as shown in the lower half of Figure 4 , by comparing “all IPC sub - classes including subsequent classes” assigned to the extracted subject applications and those assigned to backward citations . This is because , even if the subject application is diﬀerent from backward citations at the level of the ATC , there is a possibility that the subject application has close proximity with any one of the backward citations at the level of the IPC subclass . In Pattern B of Figure 3 , the subject application classiﬁed in ATC No . 7 diﬀers from at least one other backward citation as far as its ATC No . is concerned . However , when compared with the IPC subclass of its backward citations , its subject application classiﬁed in IPC subclass B24A is consistent with one of its backward Citations . To ﬁnd such a combination of pattern B , if there is at least one of the backward citations that match the subject application at the level of the IPC subclass ( that is , if the judgment of “non - coincidence” is “No” ) , the subject application is categorized into Neighboring Field . On the contrary , the subject application shown in Pattern C of Figure 3 is not only diﬀerent from one of the backward citations categorized in ATC No . 5 but also diﬀerent from its backward citation even when comparing with the IPC subclasses . The IPC subclasses A41B and B24A applied to this subject application do not match either of the IPC subclasses A21B and B01C applied to the backward citations . Thus , if there is no backward citation that matches the subject applications at the level of the IPC subclass ( that is , if the judgment of “non - coincidence” is “Yes” ) , the subject application is categorized into Distant Field . This second ﬁltering process is conducted using a commercial database with IPC patent classiﬁcation data containing not only the primary classiﬁcation but also subsequent classes of patent applications . From the explanation mentioned earlier , it is understood that the proposed technique is diﬀerent from those of previous studies in that it is characterized by ( a ) comparing the technical ﬁelds of not only the primary classiﬁcation but also the subsequent classiﬁcations and ( b ) the use of the ATC having 33 classiﬁcations that are ﬁner than IPC sections and broader than IPC classes . This is made possible by using two patent classiﬁcations without having a speciﬁc classiﬁcation corresponding to the middle hierarchy in between , rather than using three patent classiﬁcations with diﬀerent hierarchies . This proposed technique can be applied to compare not only between a subject application and backward citations but also between a subject application and forward citations ( Hirose , 2021 ) . Data and method for analysis In this section , after describing datasets , the author explains how the proposed technique to identify patent “proximity” to test the hypothesis . FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 09 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 Data Preparation of preliminary data To collect patent data related to inventions that promote NetZero , such as green technology and carbon neutrality , the author extracted the most frequently occurring natural languages and technical terms for NetZero from 5 , 249 articles published in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun from 2011 to 2021 . Then , a search formula was created using the extracted terms to search for the Japanese patent applications ﬁled in 2008 . The search formula is shown in Attachment II . As a result , 11 , 304 NetZero - related patent applications were extracted as preliminary data . In conducting the search , in order to prevent unintended search omissions due to the narrowing down of the IPC , the author avoided using patent classiﬁcations such as the IPC as much as possible . A method of searching a plurality of technical terms using proximity operators was adopted for the entire text of a patent speciﬁcation . Therefore , it is undeniable that the search results may contain some level of noise , but a high priority was put on extracting inventions related to NetZero from a wide range of technical ﬁelds . The preliminary data were grouped by IPC sections , and the grouped IPC sections were sorted in descending order of the number of patent applications ﬁled in 2008 . Therefore , IPC classes sorted in descending order of NetZero - related applications were prepared . Among the sorted IPC classes , those whose contents are related or close to each other are grouped together , and the top 50 NetZero - related technical ﬁelds are identiﬁed in descending order of the number of applications . Table 1 shows a list of the titles of the top 50 NetZero - related technical ﬁelds and the corresponding IPC classes . Dataset of subject applications Next , using the IPC classes corresponding to the top 50 NetZero - related technical ﬁelds , the patent applications that were ﬁled in 2008 and have already been examined were searched . As a result , 67 , 302 patent applications with those IPCs in the ﬁrst classiﬁcation data were extracted . These patent applications were merged into one data table , including data on patent classiﬁcations , citation information , applicant information , and forward citations updated by March 26 , 2022 . In this study , the analysis was carried out on Japanese patent applications ﬁled in 2008 . There are two reasons why this ﬁling year was chosen . First , the year 2008 is considered to be the latest year for which the Japanese Patent Oﬃce has completed most of the examinations requested under the examination - on - demand system . Second , analyzing forward citations requires suﬃcient time necessary to measure the impact on subsequent applications . The ﬁling year of 2008 refers to the actual ﬁling year of the subject application . Thus , the ﬁling year based on the priority date or the ﬁling date of the patent application is not included . In the case of an international application , the year of the international ﬁling date is adopted . FIGURE5 Percentage of publication types in citations . Dataset of backward citations The total number of backward citations in the 67 , 302 subject patent applications was 375 , 851 . Among them , Japanese patent publications including international patent publications accounted for the largest share at 91 % , and the remaining 9 % were utility model patent publications ( 4 % ) , general technical publications ( 3 % ) , and foreign patent publications ( 2 % ) , as can be seen in Figure 5 . As utility model publications and foreign patent publications have a certain proportion of old scan data from the time before patent system was digitized , and general technical publications are not classiﬁed , they were excluded from this survey on the premise that it is considered in Section “Discussion” . To reﬂect as much as possible the examiner’s evaluation of the invention in this analysis , prior patent publications that are mentioned as citations in the oﬃcial communication but are not cited as the basis for refusal are also included as backward citations in this study . 9 On the contrary , the number of backward citations cited in a patent application varies from patent application to patent application , and the number reaches nearly 50 at most . It is not necessarily desirable , however , to easily increase the number of citations when considering the eﬃciency of analysis . Figure 6 is a graph showing the distribution of the number of citations . The horizontal axis indicates the number of citations per application in order of citation , and the vertical axis indicates the number of patent applications . With reference to this ﬁgure , the average number of citations per application in this survey is calculated to be six . Since the database used in this search records the citations in the order of description of the oﬃcial actions , the citations mentioned by the examiner as the basis for refusal in the examination are recorded at the beginning , and the citations cited as reference tend 9 TheJPOExaminationGuidelinesstatethatifthereisapriorartdocument that the applicant ﬁnds useful , such as when making amendments , the examiner may include it in the prior art information ( see Guidelines , Part I ? , Chapter 2 , Section 2 . 3 ) . Although it does not serve as a basis for rejecting the claimed invention , it is considered to be useful information for determining the category of subject applications . FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 10 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 FIGURE6 Bar graphs showing the distribution of the number of citations . to be recorded later . For this reason , the analysis in this study limited citations to six per application . Method for analysis The author assumed that there is a mountain - shaped relationship ( inverted U - shaped relationship ) between the patent proximity of the claimed invention to the cited invention and the inﬂuence of the claimed invention on subsequent applications in Section Hypothesis . This means that a patent application in which a backward citation in Neighboring Field is cited in the examination is more cited in a subsequent examination than a patent application in which a backward citation in Distant Field or only the backward citation in Same Field is cited in the examination . To test the hypothesis , the author uses the patent “proximity” between claimed invention and cited invention as an independent valuable and the impact of the subject application on subsequent applications as a dependent valuable . The proximity is represented by three technical ﬁelds consisting of “same , ” “neighboring , ” and “distant” according to the degree of matching of the technical ﬁelds of combined inventions using this proposed technique . To investigate the impact of the subject application on subsequent applications , the author uses negative binomial regression for analysis of the value of the actual number of forward citations ( “F - Citations” ) . This is because linear regression by ordinary least squares assumes that there is a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables . However , in this analysis subjects , there is a possibility of non - linearity and , thus , it is necessary to deal with it . As a robustness check , the linear regression for the estimation of logarithm plus one of the dependent variable is performed . Furthermore , the number of claims in the patent application ( “Claims” ) and the number of pages in the patent speciﬁcation ( “Pages” ) were added as control variables indicating the degree of disclosure in the speciﬁcation . In Section “Discussion” , the author compares the proposed method with Nemet ( 2012 ) . Forward citations To consider whether the invention will be a seed for future technological development , the authors investigate the impact of the invention on subsequent patent applications . A number of studies have focused on the technological impact of inventions as a way to assess their importance for technological development ( Ahuja and Morris Lampert , 2001 ; Rosenkopf and Nerkar , 2001 ; Phene et al . , 2006 ) . The number of forward citations , widely used as an indicator of the value and quality of patents , is a value that indicates how much the patent is cited by subsequent patents , and the higher this value , the more inﬂuential the patent and the higher the value of the patent ( Carpenter et al . , 1981 ; Albert et al . , 1991 ; Harhoﬀ et al . , 1999 ) . Regarding forward citations , there are “applicant citations” that the applicant describes in his patent speciﬁcation and Information Disclosure Statement 10 and “examiner citations” that the examiner cites as the basis for reasons for refusal when examining an application . Although there have been some skeptical opinions about the usefulness of the examiner’s forward citation ( Meyer , 2000 ; Mihara , 2012 ) , it has been reported in the U . S . that “examiner citation” has a stronger inﬂuence on patent renewal than “applicant forward citation” ( Hegde and Sampat , 2009 ; Cotropia et al . , 2013 ; Yasukawa , 2016 ) or that the applicant’s citation and the examiner’s citation may not have been distinguished . 11 In Japan as well , it has been reported that “examiner citation” correlates with the importance of patents , rather than “applicant citation” 10 In the United States , there is a duty to disclose to the U . S . Patent and Trademark Office any known prior art that is material to the patentability of any claim of a pending U . S . patent application . Failure to disclose relevant priorartduringtheprosecutionofapatentapplicationmayleadtothepatent being unenforceable ( Code of Federal Regulations , Title 37 : 37C . F . R 1 . 56 ) . 11 It has been reported that the reason for this is that in the United States , “applicant citation” and “examiner citation” had not been distinguished as citationinformationcontainedinpatentgazettesuntil2001 ( Yasukawa , 2017 , p . 74 ) .

( Wada , 2010 ; Yamada , 2010 ; Yasukawa , 2016 , 2017 ) . Therefore , in this article that analyzes Japanese patent applications , “examiner forward citation” is used to investigate the eﬀect of the invention on subsequent patent applications . Deﬁnition of technical terms pertinent to the model In this article , the technical ﬁelds and the categories of subject application are deﬁned as follows in relation to backward Citations : Regarding patent applications and citations , “subject application” is deﬁned as a patent application ﬁled in 2008 and examined by the JPO and citing at least one patent application as prior art . “Backward citation” is deﬁned as a prior patent application cited by an examiner in the examination of the Subject application . Regarding the three technical ﬁelds , “Same Field” is deﬁned as a technical ﬁeld that is the same as that of the subject application in the ATC Nos . “Neighboring Field” is deﬁned as a technical ﬁeld that diﬀers from the ATC No . of the subject application but is the same as at least one of the IPC subclasses given to the subject application . “Distant Field” is deﬁned as a technical ﬁeld that diﬀers not only from the ATC No . of the subject application but also from any one of all IPC subclasses given to the subject application . Results In this section , the hypothesis was tested for the dataset consisting of 67 , 302 patent applications ( hereinafter referred to as “DATASET” ) belonging to the top 50 NetZero - related technical ﬁelds . Results for extracting subject applications falling into same ﬁeld As a result of the ﬁrst ﬁltering process shown in the upper half of Figure 4 , subject applications categorized in Same Field were separated from those categorized in Neighboring and Distant Fields . The number of subject applications categorized in Same Field reached 29 , 206 , which accounts for 43 % of the total applications of 67 , 302 , whereas the number of subject applications in Neighboring and Distant Fields reached 38 , 093 , which accounts for 57 % of the total applications , as shown in Figure 7A . Results for extracting subject applications falling into neighboring and distant ﬁelds Furthermore , as a result of the second ﬁltering process shown in the lower half of Figure 4 , subject applications categorized in Neighboring Field were separated from those categorized in Distant Fields . The number of subject applications categorized in Neighboring Field reached 21 , 995 , which accounts for 33 % of the total applications , whereas the number of subject applications in Distant Fields reached 16 , 098 , which accounts for 24 % of the total applications . This means that , considering only the primary classiﬁcation assigned to subject applications and their Cited Applications , the sum of Neighboring and Distant Fields accounts for 57 % of the total applications examined shown in Figure 7A . On the contrary , Neighboring Field accounts for 58 % of the 57 % when considering subsequent classiﬁcations as well , as shown in Figure 7B . Advantages of including subsequent classiﬁcations Table 2 shows the results of the subject applications categorized by the second ﬁltering process , after being extracted by the ﬁrst ﬁltering process . The columns show the groups of citations in each application , which are shown in sets ( Groups 1 – 6 ) , in order of their citation , with up to six citations covered in this analysis . Results are shown for each of the six groups . The results are shown for Neighboring and Distant Fields according to the conditions shown in Figure 3 for each of the six groups . The point of focus here is the results indicated by the bold frame which take the subsequent classiﬁcations into consideration . For the result of non - coincidence when comparing only the ﬁrst classiﬁcation , it becomes possible to divide into Neighboring Field ( 26 % of the total ) and Distant Field ( 31 % of the total ) by adding subsequent classiﬁcations to the target of comparison . The number shown in the total column becomes the number shown in the “Remove Duplicates” column by subtracting the counted number of duplicates in multiple references to the same application .

Examples of patent applications categorized into three technical ﬁelds Table 3 shows examples of patent applications categorized as “Same , ” “Neighboring , ” and “Distant” ﬁelds according to the proposed technique . The left - side columns show the patent applications ( “subject applications” ) , and the right - side columns show the backward citations cited in the prosecution of subject applications ( “backward citations” ) . The number of backward citations is listed in the order of citation of the examination and is limited to six . In each subject application and backward citation , the ﬁrst classiﬁcation in the given IPC sections and corresponding ATC Nos . are indicated by a bold border . To the right of the ATC column are all IPC subclasses assigned to each application and citation . Subject applications listed in rows Nos . 1 – 4 are examples of patent applications categorized as Same Field . A set of subject applications and backward citations that satisfy the conditions of Pattern A in Figure 3 is shown . This means that the ATC Nos . of all backward citations are the same as those of subject applications . Subject applications listed in rows Nos . 5 – 7 are examples of patent applications categorized as Neighboring Fields . According to the conditions of Pattern B in Figures 3 , 4 , combinations of applications and citations satisfying the following two conditions are shown : a ) At least one ATC No . of a Cited Application diﬀers from that of subject application . b ) In the combination that satisﬁes condition ( a ) , there is at least one of the backward citations that matches subject application at the level of the IPC subclass ( Corresponding IPC subclasses are indicated in blue ) . A clear example is given in row No . 6 . In this case , there are two citations , C2 and C3 ( Application Nos . 1998 - 53923 and 1998 - 145433 ) , both of which have the same ATC number ( No . 10 ) . They are diﬀerent from the ATC number ( No . 31 ) of the subject application ( Application No . 2008 - 020526 ) , but they are common in the level of IPC subclass ( B60L ) . Subject applications listed in rows Nos . 8 – 10 are examples of patent applications categorized as Distant Fields . According to the conditions of Pattern C in Figures 3 , 4 , combinations of applications and citations satisfying the following two conditions are shown : a ) At least one ATC No . of a Cited Application diﬀers from that of subject application . b ) In the combination that satisﬁes condition ( a ) , there is no backward citation that matches subject application even at the IPC subclass level ( Corresponding IPC subclasses are indicated in red ) . Row No . 9 provides a clear example of this . In this case , there are two citations , C5 and C6 ( Application Nos . 1998 - 53923 and 1998 - 145433 ) , both of which have the same ATC number ( No . 28 ) . They are diﬀerent not only from the ATC number ( No . 31 ) of the subject application ( Application No . 2008 - 184526 ) but also from subject application in the level of their IPC subclasses .

( Corresponding IPC subclasses are indicated in blue ) . These combinations were determined to be “Neighboring” ﬁelds by considering all subsequent classiﬁcations into consideration . All of these examples are combinations that would be categorized as “Distant” ﬁelds if judged only with the ﬁrst classiﬁcation . Nemet and Johnson ( 2012 ) allowed the use of the IPC in place of the U . S . System ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 14 ) . Even if IPC sections are used here , instead of ATC , as indicated by the black border in Table 3 , the problems in Neighboring Fields are not resolved . A solution to this is to consider subsequent classiﬁcations , as emphasized in this proposal . This is the reason why the proposed technique is better than the ones in the previous method . The quantitative eﬀect of using subsequent classiﬁcations is revisited in Section “Discussion” . Analysis of the entire dataset Table 4 shows the result of negative binomial regression ( “NB Regression” ) analysis in assessing the eﬀect of the combination with technology in Neighboring and Distant Fields on the actual number of forward citations ( “F - Citations” ) . Table 5 shows the summary of the variables used therein . The evaluation results show that the NB Regression coeﬃcient increases at the signiﬁcance level of 1 % or less as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Same Field to Neighboring Field , whereas it decreases as the technical ﬁeld shifts to Distant Field . In Table 4 , NB Regressions of Claims and Pages added as control valuables are also increased at a signiﬁcant level of 1 % . This is probably because the number of claims and the number of pages in the speciﬁcation aﬀect the degree of disclosure of the inventions . On the contrary , it is one order of magnitude smaller than the coeﬃcients of Neighboring and Distant Fields , and the author believes that the inﬂuence of changes in the technological ﬁeld is small .

This result of regression analysis can also be seen in the line graph of Figure 8 , which shows the relation between the NB Regression coeﬃcient and proximity between claimed invention and cited invention . The proximity is shown as three technical ﬁelds consisting of Same , Neighboring , and Distant along the horizontal axis . The NB Regression coeﬃcient is represented by the scale shown in the left vertical axis . As understood from the ﬁgure , the line graph of the NB Regression coeﬃcient shows a mountain - shaped pattern , increasing as the technical ﬁeld shifts from “Same Field” to “Neighboring Fields” and decreasing as the technical ﬁeld shifts from “Neighboring Fields” to “Distant Fields” . Therefore , from the overall perspective of the DATASET , the Hypothesis is aﬃrmed . As a robustness check , the author also performed linear regressions for the estimation of logarithm plus one of the dependent variables ( “F - Citations” ) . The results of this additional analysis are shown in Table 6 . Table 7 shows the summary of the variables used therein . The comparison of the additional analysis with the main analysis shows that the results tend to be robust as the results of the former are substantially similar to those of the latter and signiﬁcance levels remain stable . Analysis by technical ﬁeld Next , Hypothesis was tested using the NB Regression analysis on the DATASET divided by the top 50 technical ﬁelds to analyze the impact of the subject application on subsequent applications . The results of the NB Regression analysis are shown in Table 8 .

As understood from the comparison of the results for each of the ﬁelds of the IPC , the relationship between the results of the NB Regression analysis and the three technical ﬁelds shows unique tendencies for each subclass of the IPC . As a subject of veriﬁcation , 25 ﬁelds in which the coeﬃcient of either Neighboring or Distant Fields has a signiﬁcance level of 10 % or less were selected from Table 8 . Figures 9A – D are line graphs showing the change in the NB Regression coeﬃcient for the 25 selected ﬁelds . They are grouped by four patterns I – IV depending on the technical ﬁelds of “Same Field” through “Distant Fields” : Pattern I shown in Figure 9A is the upward inclined pattern . Pattern II shown in Figure 9B is the mountain - shaped pattern . Pattern III shown in Figure 9C is the valley - shape pattern , and Pattern—shown in Figure 9D is the downward inclined pattern . Among these patterns , Pattern II corresponds to the technical ﬁelds that satisfy Hypothesis . From the comparison results for Patterns I through IV , it can be seen that there are many mountain - shaped patterns ( Pattern II ) in the analysis of the NB Regression coeﬃcient . For example , the natural resins ( C09F ) listed as No . 42 , as shown in Figure 9F , and the wind motors ( F03D ) listed as No . 3 indicate that the NB Regression coeﬃcient increases at the signiﬁcance level of 1 % or less as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Same Field to Neighboring Field but decreases as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Neighboring Field to Distant ﬁeld . Twenty ATCs , including these two , are shown in Figure 9B as technology ﬁelds that demonstrate the mountain - shaped pattern ( Pattern II ) that satisﬁes the hypothesis . It can be seen that there is one example of an upward - inclined pattern ( Pattern I ) in Figure 9A . This is the cultivation of vegetable , rice , seaweed , forestry , and watering ( A01G ) listed as No . 43 , which shows that the NB Regression coeﬃcient increases at the signiﬁcance level of 5 % or less as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Same Field to Distant Field , as shown in Figure 9E . This A01G was the only classiﬁcation showing the upward - inclined pattern among the top 50 technical ﬁelds . As an example of the downward - inclined pattern ( Pattern IV ) , Figure 9H shows the alloys ( C22C ) listed as No . 21 where the NB Regression coeﬃcient decreases at the signiﬁcance level of 10 % or less as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Neighboring Field to Distant Field . As an example of the valley - shaped pattern ( Pattern III ) , Figure 9G shows the controlling combustion engines ( F02D ) listed as No . 28 where the NB Regression coeﬃcient decreases at the signiﬁcance level of 5 % or less as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Same Field to Neighboring Field . To conﬁrm the content of patent applications shown in the top 50 NetZero - related technical ﬁelds , the author reviewed several patent applications from them . A summary of 11 patent applications , taken as examples from six representative technical ﬁelds , is provided in Appendix V . There are two reasons for analyzing the results by patent classiﬁcations that represent the technical ﬁelds . First , when conducting empirical studies using patent information , it is generally agreed upon to take into account that diﬀerent technical ﬁelds have diﬀerent views on the value of patents . It is generally agreed upon to take into account that diﬀerent technical ﬁelds have diﬀerent views on the value of patents ( Mihara , 2012 , p . 740 ) . This is because there are technological ﬁelds such as chemistry and biotechnology where a small number of patents determine value and ﬁelds such as software and semiconductors where thousands of patents are intricately intertwined with a single product ( Mihara , 2012 , p . 740 ) . Second , it is for comparing the method proposed in this article with those of the three previous studies dealt with in the ﬁrst section . Nemet and Johnson ( 2012 ) mainly dealt with technical ﬁelds related to electricity and pharmaceuticals . Keijl et al . ( 2016 ) relied on the biopharmaceutical industry , and Nemet ( 2012 ) concerned energy technology , all of which target diﬀerent technical ﬁelds . Analysis by IPC sections Furthermore , Hypothesis was tested using the NB Regression analysis on the datasets divided into eight sections of IPC to analyze the impact of the subject application on subsequent applications . The results of the NB Regression analysis are shown in Table 9 . Table 10 shows the summary of the variables used therein . As understood from the comparison of the results for each section of the IPC , the relationship between the result of the NB Regression and the three technical ﬁelds shows unique FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 17 frontiersin . org H i r o s e 10 . 3389 / f r m a . 2023 . 978249 TABLE 8 Tables showing the results of negative binominal regression for hypothesis .

It can be seen from the ﬁgure that IPC Sections B ( performing operations and transporting ) , C ( chemistry and metallurgy ) , D ( textiles and paper ) , G ( physics ) , and H ( electricity ) demonstrate the mountain - shaped pattern ( Pattern II ) that satisﬁes the hypothesis . They show that the NB Regression coeﬃcient increases as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Same Field to Neighboring Field at the signiﬁcance level of 1 % or less but decreases as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Neighboring Field to Distant Field . Figures 10A – H are graphs showing the results in Table 9 . From these ﬁgures , it is understood that all IPC sections , except Section A , show the mountain - shaped pattern ( Pattern II ) that satisﬁes the hypothesis . Also , as mentioned earlier , the ﬁve IPC Sections B – D , G , and H have relatively small standard errors . Discussion In this section , after reviewing the results of testing the hypothesis , the author examines the diﬀerences between the previous studies mentioned in Section Previous literature and the proposed technique . Results of testing the hypothesis presented in this article The hypothesis was that there was a mountain - shaped relationship ( an inverted - U - shaped relationship ) between the patent proximity between claimed invention and cited invention and the impact of the subject application on subsequent applications . From the overall perspective of all patent applications ﬁled in 2008 ( refer Tables 4 , 6 ; Figure 8 ) , the hypothesis was supported . From the perspective of view of each IPC section , IPC Sections B – D , G , and H demonstrate the mountain - shaped pattern ( Pattern II ) that satisﬁes the hypothesis . The NB regression coeﬃcients tend to increase as the technology ﬁeld shifts from Same Field to Neighboring Field at the signiﬁcance level of 1 % or less for the abovementioned ﬁve sections of the IPC but tend to decrease as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Neighboring to Distant Field ( refer Table 9 ; Figures 10A – H ) . The hypothesis was also tested for the dataset divided by the top 50 NetZero - related technical ﬁelds to analyze the impact of the subject application on subsequent applications ( refer Table 8 ) . As a subject of veriﬁcation , it was found that there were 20 technical ﬁelds demonstrating the mountain - shaped pattern ( Pattern II ) that satisﬁes the hypothesis . The NB Regression coeﬃcient increases at the signiﬁcance level of 10 % or less as the technical ﬁeld shifts from Same Field to Neighboring Field but decreases as the technical ﬁeld shifts from ( refer Nos . 3 , 6 , 9 , 11 – 14 , 16 , 22 , 26 , 29 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 36 , 42 , 44 , 45 , 49 , and 50 of Table 8 ; Figure 9B ) . Comparison with previous method In considering the diﬀerences between the previous method mentioned in Section Previous literature and the technique proposed in this article , the author focuses on the study by Nemet ( 2012 ) . This is because Nemet ( 2012 , p . 1261 ) restricted the analysis to patents deﬁned as energy technologies according to the list of energy classes suggested by Popp and Newell ( 2009 ) .

FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 24 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 patents targeted by Nemet ( 2012 ) are included in the search conditions of this article . It is understood that Nemet ( 2012 ) followed the same method as Nemet and Johnson ( 2012 ) and used only the primary classiﬁcation and not the subsequent classiﬁcations . Nemet and Johnson ( 2012 ) coded each citation pair as “Far external , ” “External , ” and “Near” by comparing their classiﬁcation at each level in the hierarchy . Since they allow the use of the IPC in place of the U . S . System ( Nemet and Johnson , 2012 , p . 14 ) , IPC sections are used here as a superclass denoting “far external” and subclasses of the IPC as the converse denoting “near” . Therefore , using the analysis results of the technique proposed in this article , the author examines the diﬀerence in the results when analyzing using the IPC section and subsections . Comparison on “far external” Tables 11A , B show the results of the subject patent application categorized into Distant Fields by the second ﬁltering process ( refer Figure 5 ) . As shown in Table 2 , the groups of citations cited in each application are shown in sets ( Groups 1 – 6 ) , in order of their citation , with up to six citations covered in this analysis . Results are shown for each of the six groups . A patent application categorized into Distant Fields must have a citation whose ATC classiﬁcation is diﬀerent from that of the subject application and whose IPC subclasses do not match any of the IPC subclasses of the subject application . For patent applications satisfying this condition , the author searched for citations whose IPC section of the ﬁrst classiﬁcation showed a match between the subject application and the citations . As a result , it turned out that about 22 % corresponded as shown in Table 11A . This is mainly due to the diﬀerences in the hierarchical structure and breadth of classiﬁcation between the ATC with 33 classiﬁcations and the IPC sections with 8 classiﬁcations . Next , as a result of conducting a search that included the subsequent classiﬁcations of the citations , the matching rate of the IPC sections increased to 34 % as shown in Table 11B . This is obviously due to considering subsequent classiﬁcations as well as the ﬁrst classiﬁcations . This search result reveals that the superclass denoting the “far external” category of Nemet ( 2012 ) partially overlaps Neighboring Fields as well as Distant Fields deﬁned in the proposed technique . Comparison with “near” Tables 12A , B show the result of the subject patent application categorized into Neighboring Fields by the second ﬁltering process ( refer Figure 5 ) . As shown in Table 2 , the citations for each application are shown divided into the six groups covered in this analysis . A patent application categorized into Neighboring Fields must have a citation whose ATC classiﬁcation is diﬀerent from that of the subject application , but at least one of whose IPC subclasses matches any of the IPC subclasses of the subject application .

As a result , it turned out that only 1 % corresponded , as shown in Table 12A . Next , as a result of conducting a search that included the subsequent classiﬁcations of the citations , the matching rate of the IPC subsection increased from 1 to 62 % , as shown in Table 12B . This is obviously due to considering subsequent classiﬁcations as well as the ﬁrst classiﬁcations . This search result reveals that the IPC subclasses denoting the “near” category of Nemet ( 2012 ) partially overlap Same Field as well as Neighboring Fields deﬁned in the proposed technique . Potential impact on analytical results From the abovementioned two comparison results , it is considered that the superclass denoting “far external” and IPC subclasses denoting “near” shown in Nemet ( 2012 ) are shifted toward the Same Field side more than the Distant Fields and Neighboring Fields deﬁned in this proposal . This becomes clear by considering the subsequent classiﬁcations in the comparison , although it is not clear from the comparison of the ﬁrst classiﬁcations alone . Unlike Nemet and Johnson ( 2012 ) and Nemet ( 2012 ) showed that for energy technologies , the integration of technologically distant prior art ( i . e . , distant knowledge ) has a stronger positive eﬀect on knowledge ﬂows than the integration of technologically near prior art ( i . e . , local knowledge ) . However , considering the possibility that the analysis results will shift from the distant prior art to the near prior art , there is a possibility that the results of Nemet ( 2012 ) will be higher in the Neighboring Fields than in the Distant Fields , as in the analysis results of this proposal . Examination of backward citations excluded from analysis As mentioned in Section Data , this study does not analyze utility models , general technical documents , and foreign patent documents as backward citations . This subsection examines the proportion of these non - targeted publications in each technical ﬁeld . Figure 11 is bar graphs showing the proportion of these three types of non - targeted publications to the total for each ATC ﬁeld . From these graphs , it can be seen that in some technical ﬁelds , the proportion of non - targeted publications to the total is relatively high . For example , in ATC 13 ( organic chemistry ) and ATC 16 ( biotechnology ) , the proportion of citing general technical publications is comparatively high , reaching 10 and 29 % , respectively . In ATC 13 ( organic chemistry ) and ATC 16 ( biotechnology ) , the proportion of citing general technical publications is comparatively high , reaching 10 and 29 % , respectively . In addition , in ATC 1 ( agriculture ) , ATC 11 ( container and wrapping ) , and ATC 21 ( construction ) , the proportion of citing utility model patent publications is high , reaching 16 , 19 , and 10 % , respectively . Therefore , the author holds oﬀ on FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 26 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 FIGURE11 Bar graphs showing the percentage of each publication by ATC . drawing conclusions about the results of analysis in these ﬁve technical ﬁelds . Conclusion Summary This study showcases a technique to categorize NetZero - related patent applications into three technical ﬁelds according to the degree of proximity between claimed invention and cited inventions by comparing technological classiﬁcations between the patent applications and the cited applications thereof . In showing this method , the author explains the modiﬁed technique proposed by the author as well as the existing methods used in previous studies . The proposed technique is diﬀerent from those of previous studies in that it is characterized by comparing the technical ﬁelds of not only the primary classiﬁcation but also the subsequent classiﬁcations . This is made possible by using two patent classiﬁcations without having a speciﬁc classiﬁcation corresponding to the middle hierarchy in between , rather than using three patent classiﬁcations with diﬀerent hierarchies . This technique reduces the possibility that two applications , even if they are the same in their subsequent classiﬁcation , will be judged as applications in diﬀerent technical ﬁelds because they are in diﬀerent classes in the primary classiﬁcation . Using the proposed technique , the author examined the impact on the subsequent patent application of NetZero - related patent applications ﬁled in Japan . As a result of the analysis , the author found that approximately 33 % of subject applications , whose technical ﬁeld diﬀers from the backward citations when comparing the primary classiﬁcation only , match one of the subsequent classiﬁcations when comparing them in consideration of the subsequent classiﬁcations as well . The author then found that the 33 % of subject applications had a greater impact on the subsequent patent applications than the remaining applications . The evaluation results show that , looking at the top 50 NetZero - related technical ﬁelds as a whole , IPC Sections B – D , G , and H demonstrate the mountain - shaped pattern ( Pattern II ) that satisﬁes the hypothesis . They show that the NB Regression coeﬃcient increases as the technical ﬁeld shifts from the Same Field to the Neighboring Field at the signiﬁcance level of 1 % or less but decreases as the technical ﬁeld shifts from the Neighboring to Distant Field . Practical implications Japanese patent applications ﬁled in 2008 were selected for this study for two reasons explained in Section Data and method for analysis . However , it is noted that 2008 was only selected for the initial analysis . There was a need to ensure suﬃcient time to obtain the backward citations necessary to measure the proximities of the patents and the forward citations necessary to measure the impact on the subsequent applications . The author believes that the trend of a mountain - shaped pattern that was obtained by this study will have a certain degree of continuity even if the patent ﬁling year changes . Nevertheless , the need for multi - year surveys to supplement this single - year survey will be required . FrontiersinResearchMetricsandAnalytics 27 frontiersin . org Hirose 10 . 3389 / frma . 2023 . 978249 Using the technique proposed in this article , an R & D manager can obtain information to consider whether to search distant technologies , neighboring technologies , or combinations within the same ﬁelds in terms of their impact on forward citations in that ﬁeld of interest . According to the Japan Patent Oﬃce Annual Report published in 2022 , 72 % of patent applications ﬁled in 2015 have already been requested for examination . Considering that it is possible to apply for accelerated examination for the target of green innovation , it is thought that a considerable number of backward citations have been accumulated even in patent applications ﬁled in 2015 . The author believes that the proposed technique will be useful as support for an R & D manager in identifying / discovering technical ﬁelds to tackle the target issue in line with the COP 26 initiatives . Contribution of this article In modern society , where technology is becoming more and more complicated , it is diﬃcult to deﬁne technology with one technological classiﬁcation . An increasing number of patent applications are matching subsequent classiﬁcations , even though the two patents have diﬀerent initial classiﬁcations . This study makes contributions to the previous literature by showing the proposed technique , which makes it possible to reduce the possibility that two inventions common to any of the subsequent classiﬁcations cannot be distinguished even if the primary classiﬁcations are diﬀerent . Limitations In this study , only Japanese patent publications are targeted as backward citations , and utility model patent publications , general technical publications , and foreign patent publications are not included in the analysis . However , since there are technical ﬁelds in which these non - targeted publications account for a relatively high percentage of backward citations , the author withholds conclusions about the ﬁve technical ﬁelds mentioned in the previous section . Furthermore , in this article , the author deﬁned three technical ﬁelds , namely , “same , ” “neighboring , ” and “distant” in Section Hypothesis . However , it cannot be said that the deﬁnitions of these terms have been suﬃciently deﬁned and uniﬁed in comparison with multiple previous studies . These points remain to be addressed in a future study . Future research This study was conducted for patent applications ﬁled in 2008 only . There is still room to examine the hypothesis for patent applications ﬁled in a year other than 2008 . The author believes that the proposed technique can also be applied to the analysis of foreign patent applications . However , since there are important diﬀerences across jurisdictions in citation rules and practice as mentioned by Jaﬀe ( 2017 , p . 1360 ) , it is necessary to pay close attention to these diﬀerences when applying it . 12 Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article / Supplementary material , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author .
