Rouleau 1 † M irror movements ( MM ) are contralateral involuntary movements that mirror vol - untary ones . MM are occasionally found in young children , but persistence beyond age 10 is unusual except in certain disorders of nervous sys - tem crossing such as Klippel - Feil and Kallmann syndrome . The study of individuals with MM can provide important insights into the mechanisms of contralateral innervation . We recently described a large four - generation French Canadian ( FC ) family with isolated congen - ital MM ( CMM ) ( 1 ) . Pedigree analysis suggested autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance . We conducted a genome - wide link - age analysis and identified a single significant locus on chromosome 18q21 . 2 . Haplotype analysis indi - cated that all affected individuals share a com - mon risk haplotype ( figs . S1 and S2 ) . The region spans 2 . 5 Mb and contains three known genes , including DCC ( deleted in colorectal carcinoma ) . Sequencing of the 29 coding exons of DCC re - vealed a guanine to adenine substitution at the first intronic nucleotide after exon 6 , in the splice donor consensussequenceoftheexon ( c . 1140 + 1G > A , Fig . 1A left ) . The mutation segregated with the risk haplotype and was not found in 760 unrelated Caucasian controls , including 512 FC . Copy num - ber variation analysis in315 FC controlsdid not reveal any structural variants encompassing DCC exons . To assess the effect of this mutation on splic - ing , we extracted RNA from immortalized lym - phoblast cells derived from four mutation carriers and one noncarrier relative and performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . Amplification of the cDNA between exons 4 and 7 and subsequent gel electrophoresis identified a 408 – base pair ( bp ) fragment corresponding to the predictedampliconsizefoundinallindividualsanda253 - bp fragment found only in affected individ - uals ( Fig . 1B ) . Sequence analysis confirmed that the 253 - bp fragment corresponds to an aberrant tran - script lacking exon 6 . Abnormalskipping of exon 6 leads to a frameshift mutation from amino acid 329 andtheintroductionofastopcodon15aminoacidsfurtherdownthenewreadingframe ( p . V329GfsX15 ) . This mutation is predicted to result in a truncated DCC protein lacking most of its functional domains . ThismutantDCCdoesnotbindnetrin ( Fig . 1 , Cand D , and fig . S3 ) . To confirm the role of DCC in CMM , we se - quenced DCC in a previously described Iranian family with CMM ( 2 ) . We found a guanine inser - tion in exon 3 ( Fig . 1A right ) segregating with the disorder ( fig . S4 ) that results in a frameshift also predicted to result in a truncated DCC protein [ c . 571dupG ; p . V191GfsX35 ( Fig . 1D ) ] . This muta - tion was absent in 538 unrelated control individuals . DCC is a receptor for netrin - 1 , a diffusible ex - tracellular protein that helps guide axons of the de - veloping nervous system across the body ’ s midline ( 3 ) . ThefourthandfifthfibronectintypeIIIrepeatsin DCC are responsible for its binding to netrin - 1 ( 4 ) . Mice with homozygous null DCC mutations have severe defects of commissural development in the brain and spinal cord , with absent corpus callosum and decreased number and misrouting of commis - suralaxons ( 5 ) . “ Kanga ” micehavedeletionsof DCC exon 29 and exhibit mirror - type movements that result in a distinctive hopping gait ( 6 ) . The latter mutant also shows defects in the crossing of cortico - spinal tracts and persistence of ipsilateral cortico - spinal tracts in hindbrain and spinal cord . This is consistentwithhumanneurophysiologicalstudiesinwhichunilateralstimulationofthemotorcortexinpatientswithMMevokes , in contrast to normal par - ticipants , a bilateral response ( 7 ) ( fig . S5 ) , indicating a misdirected ipsilateral corticospinal connection . We propose that the DCC mutations in indi - viduals with CMM cause a reduction in gene dos - age and less robust midline guidance , which may lead to a partial failure of axonal fiber crossing and development of an abnormal ipsilateral connec - tion . Our genetic findings confirm that DCC has a central role in the development of human nervous system lateralization . References 1 . M . Srour et al . , Neurology 73 , 729 ( 2009 ) . 2 . N .
