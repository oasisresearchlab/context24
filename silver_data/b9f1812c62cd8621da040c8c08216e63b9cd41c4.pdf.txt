Methods : We analyzed the data of 7 , 758 children and adolescents with COVID - 19 and characteristics of secondary transmission generated by these cases using case information published by local governments . Ratio of pediatric and adolescent cases generating secondary transmission was calculated for various social settings . Results : The incidence of COVID - 19 was 24 . 8 cases per 10 5 population aged between 0 and 9 years , and 59 . 2 among those aged between 10 and 19 years , which was lower than that among individuals of all age groups ( 79 . 6 per 10 5 population ) between January 15 and October 31 , 2020 . The proportion of cases generating secondary cases was 8 . 3 % among infants and young children in nursery schools and kindergartens , 16 % among children and adolescents attending primary schools , 34 % among those attending junior high schools , 43 % among those attending high schools , 31 % among those attending professional training colleges , and 24 % in those attending universities . Households were the most common setting for secondary transmission . Conclusion : The risk of generating secondary cases might be limited among pediatric and adolescent cases with COVID - 19 , especially in settings outside households . Effectiveness of traditional mitigation measures ( e . g . , school closures ) to suppress COVID - 19 transmissions should be carefully evaluated .

COVID - 19 in Children and Adolescents FIGURE 1 | Temporal distribution of pediatric and adolescent cases with COVID - 19 in Japan , from January 15 to October 31 , 2020 . The numbers of COVID - 19 cases were plotted for ( A ) pediatric and adolescent cases and ( B ) total cases of all age groups based on date of onset . The date of onset was available for 5 , 037 out of 7 , 758 pediatric and adolescent cases , and 75 , 622 out of 100 , 436 cases of all age groups . A 7 - day moving average ( values of 3 days before and 3 days after the indicated date ) of the proportion of pediatric cases out of the total cases was also plotted in ( B ) . INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) generally causes mild or asymptomatic infections in children and adolescents compared to older age groups ( 1 ) . The incidence of COVID - 19 among children and adolescents is also lower than that among adults , potentially due to multiple factors , such as diﬀerent exposure patterns and gene expression proﬁles ( 2 , 3 ) . In seasonal and pandemic inﬂuenza , children and adolescents play a major role in spreading the virus in the community ; therefore , school closures are eﬀective in suppressing inﬂuenza transmission ( 4 , 5 ) . Conversely , their role in spreading COVID - 19 in the community is not fully understood due to the limited information about secondary transmission generated by them ( 6 – 8 ) . In this study , we aimed to reveal the secondary transmission rate of pediatric and adolescent cases with COVID - 19 in various settings and their role in transmission dynamics in the community . Abbreviations : COVID - 19 , coronavirus disease 2019 . METHODS A retrospective data analysis was conducted for patients with COVID - 19 aged < 20 years in Japan between January 15 and October 31 , 2020 . In Japan , it is mandatory to report every conﬁrmed COVID - 19 case , who were diagnosed by validated testing methods including polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using respiratory samples or saliva , quantitative antigen tests using respiratory samples or saliva , and point - of - care antigen tests using respiratory samples ( 9 ) . Information about these cases ( e . g . , demographics , date of onset , contact with previously conﬁrmed cases , places where contact with previously conﬁrmed cases occurred ) is posted on the local government website every day . The age of each patient is published in 10 - year incremental age groups . We retrieved this information and constructed a database as previously described ( Supplementary Table 1 ) ( 10 , 11 ) . In the study , the age of students in primary schools , junior high schools , and high schools was deﬁned as 7 – 12 years old , 13 – 15 years old , and 16 – 18 years old , respectively . The incidence of pediatric and adolescent cases was calculated for Frontiers in Pediatrics | www . frontiersin . org 2 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 705882 Imamura et al . COVID - 19 in Children and Adolescents those aged between 0 and 9 years and 10 and 19 years using the population data published by Statistics Bureau of Japan ( 12 ) . Five or more COVID - 19 cases with known contact with previously conﬁrmed cases in the same events or venues were deﬁned as a cluster , based on information about places of contacts and dates of onset / conﬁrmation , which were collected during case investigations by local public health authorities and summarized in our database . The secondary transmission rate was calculated for pediatric and adolescent cases who had no known contact with previously conﬁrmed cases . This is because individuals who had known contact with conﬁrmed cases before conﬁrmation were requested to be self - quarantined before conﬁrmation ( 9 ) . Deﬁnition of a pair of primary and secondary cases was described in Supplementary Figure 1 . Statistical analysis was conducted by using R ver . 3 . 5 . 0 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . A Student’s t - test was performed to compare continuous variables between 2 groups . A p < 0 . 05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant . RESULTS In the study , we identiﬁed 7 , 758 conﬁrmed cases among individuals aged 0 – 9 years and 10 – 19 years . The incidence of pediatric and adolescent cases in the study was 24 . 8 cases per 10 5 population ( 2 , 450 / 9 , 860 × 10 3 ) aged between 0 and 9 years , and 59 . 2 ( 6 , 608 / 11 , 170 × 10 3 ) among those aged between 10 and 19 years between January 15 and October 31 , 2020 . The numbers of pediatric and adolescent cases reached their peaks in mid - April and resurged from late - June , which was parallel to the increasing patterns of the total cases of all age groups ( Figure 1 ) . The median ( interquartile range ) of the duration between onset and conﬁrmation was 4 days ( 3 – 7 ) among pediatric and adolescent cases , which was signiﬁcantly shorter than that among the total cases of all age groups [ 6 days ( 3 – 9 ) , p < 0 . 001 ] . Among 7 , 758 cases , 4 , 734 ( 61 % ) cases had contact with previously conﬁrmed cases ( Table 1 ) . They were presumed to have acquired infection in various settings , however , the household was the most common setting ( 1 , 521 / 4 , 734 , 32 % ) ( Table 1 ) . Among 3 , 024 cases without known contact with previously conﬁrmed cases , 297 cases ( 9 . 8 % , 297 / 3 , 024 ) generated secondary cases ( Table 2 ) . Among these 297 cases , 168 cases ( 57 % , 168 / 297 ) generated only 1 secondary case , 118 cases ( 40 % , 118 / 297 ) generated 2 – 4 cases , and 11 cases ( 3 . 7 % , 11 / 297 ) generated 5 – 10 cases . The proportion of cases that generated secondary transmission was lower than 10 % among infants and young children not attending nursery schools and those attending nursery schools and kindergartens , and lower among those attending primary schools ( 16 % ) . Conversely , the proportion was higher than 20 % among students in universities and workers , and higher than 30 % among those attending junior high schools , high schools , and professional training colleges ( Table 2 ) . The proportion was 2 . 7 and 2 . 1 times higher among junior high school and high school children than TABLE 1 | Characteristics of children and adolescents with COVID - 19 .

Thirteen clusters , including 1 ( 13 % , 1 / 8 ) in a nursery school , 2 ( 67 % , 2 / 3 ) in primary schools , 1 ( 33 % , 1 / 3 ) in junior high schools , 6 ( 86 % , 6 / 7 ) in high schools , 1 ( 50 % , 1 / 2 ) in professional training colleges , and 2 ( 40 % , 2 / 5 ) in universities were considered to have been caused by pediatric and adolescent primary cases ( Table 3 ) . Other settings where clusters associated with pediatric and adolescent cases were identiﬁed included medical and social welfare facilities ( n = 14 ) , restaurants and bars ( n = 12 ) , oﬃces ( n = 5 ) , theaters ( n = 2 ) and gyms ( n = 2 ) . DISCUSSION We reported the secondary transmission rate of pediatric and adolescent cases with COVID - 19 and their roles in transmission of COVID - 19 in various settings . The incidence of pediatric and adolescent cases was lower than that of cases among individuals of all age groups ( 79 . 6 cases per 10 5 population [ 100 , 436 / 126 , 167 × 10 3 ) ] in our database , which was in line with previous studies in other countries ( 13 ) . In contrast to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic , in which children and adolescents were the most aﬀected age groups , their Frontiers in Pediatrics | www . frontiersin . org 5 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 705882 Imamura et al . COVID - 19 in Children and Adolescents risks of acquiring infection were assumed to be limited for COVID - 19 ( 14 ) . The signiﬁcantly shorter duration between onset and conﬁrmation than older age groups was potentially because most of the infected children and adolescents were identiﬁed as close contacts of previously conﬁrmed cases . This also might be contributing to high proportions of asymptomatic cases among children and adolescents with COVID - 19 . Furthermore , the most common setting where pediatric and adolescent cases generated secondary transmission was their households . Our results suggest their limited capacities to spread COVID - 19 in settings outside households . This ﬁnding was in consistence with previous reports of pediatric and adolescent COVID - 19 cases in Ireland and Singapore which described their minimal capacity to transmit the virus at schools ( 15 , 16 ) . Notably , the risk of generating secondary cases among children and adolescents appears to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between inﬂuenza and COVID - 19 . During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic , the relative risk of pediatric and adolescent cases transmitting the virus in households was highest among those aged between 6 and 10 years ( 5 ) . However , in this study , the proportion of cases that generated secondary cases was lowest among infants and young children and it was higher in those in primary schools . Furthermore , the proportion was distinctively higher among junior high school ( 13 – 15 years old ) and high school children ( 16 – 18 years old ) , which was signiﬁcantly higher than primary school children ( 7 – 12 years old ) . The proportions were also higher among students in professional colleges and universities and workers than primary school children , although there was no statistical signiﬁcance . The limitations of this study include a high proportion of pediatric and adolescent cases with unspeciﬁed backgrounds , potential inaccuracy in deﬁning primary and secondary cases based on comparison of onset / conﬁrmation dates , and limited information about contribution of control measures on transmission dynamics ( 13 ) . In addition , due to the high proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases among children and adolescents with COVID - 19 , it could not be ruled out that the incidence of pediatric and adolescent cases was potentially underestimated . In conclusion , this study highlighted the limited public health impact of children and adolescents in spreading COVID - 19 in settings outside households , especially among those younger than junior high school children . Careful observations are required to elucidate the eﬀectiveness of the traditional mitigation measures ( e . g . , school closures ) to suppress COVID - 19 transmissions related to children and adolescents . Further studies are required to reveal the underlying mechanisms ( e . g . , the angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 expression proﬁles , social activities ) for such limited roles of children and adolescents in the COVID - 19 transmission dynamics in the community .

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at : https : / / www . frontiersin . org / articles / 10 . 3389 / fped . 2021 . 705882 / full # supplementary - material Supplementary Figure 1 | Deﬁnition of the pair of primary cases and secondary cases . The concept of a pair of primary and secondary cases in the study is illustrated . Cases before being classiﬁed as either of primary or secondary cases were indicated in white symbols ( A ) . Cases who were classiﬁed as primary cases were indicated in gray symbols , and those classiﬁed as secondary cases were in black symbols ( B ) . Each secondary case was regarded to have only one primary case , and a primary case was regarded to have earlier date of onset than secondary cases . Information about places of contacts and dates of onset was collected during case investigations in local governments and were summarized in our database . If cases were asymptomatic or their date of onset was unknown , date of conﬁrmation was used to identify primary and secondary cases . If more than one suspected primary case had same date of onset , we regarded the case with the earliest date of conﬁrmation or the smallest identiﬁcation numbers assigned by local governments as the primary case . Date of onset of secondary cases were regarded to be within 7 days after the date of onset of primary cases . The white symbol 1 , without known contact with previously conﬁrmed cases , had earlier date of onset or conﬁrmation than white symbols 2 – 4 ( A ) . Therefore , the white symbol 1 was classiﬁed as the primary case ( gray symbol 1 ) , and the white symbols 2 – 4 were classiﬁed as his / her secondary cases ( black symbols 2 – 4 ) ( B ) .
