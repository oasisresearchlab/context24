BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS NATURE METHODS | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | 1 ensure that the model is not only reasonable but also well fitted to the map . However , simple correlation metrics tend to be domi - nated by low - resolution , high - signal features , which can render it difficult to assess the reliability of the highest - resolution features of EM maps , such as side chain or ligand conformations 11 , 12 . These problems can potentially be corrected through monitor - ing of the correlation in Fourier space at high frequency 9 or use of the real space correlation to band - pass – filtered maps as a cross - validation target for refinement 11 . An alternative solution for assessing the reliability of high - resolution models is to examine statistical signatures of the weaker , high - resolution data . Here , we extend Ringer , an approach that detects unmodeled alternative conformations in electron density maps generated by high - resolution X - ray crystallogra - phy 13 , 14 , to directly reveal the side chain information content of EM maps . This approach , EMRinger ( https : / / github . com / fraser - lab / EMRinger and Supplementary Software ) , interpolates the normalized value of the cryo - EM map at each potential position of the C (cid:71) position around the (cid:67) 1 dihedral angle , assuming the currently modeled N , C (cid:65) and C (cid:66) atomic positions ( Fig . 1a ) . We next plot the distribution of map values by dihedral angle ( Fig . 1b ) , which reveals local information about both the map and correctness of the backbone of the atomic model . The peak in the distribution represents the most probable position of the C (cid:71) atom of the side chain , even when it is not immediately obvi - ous ‘by eye’ . The position of C (cid:71) is constrained to avoid ‘eclipsed’ steric overlaps 15 . This bias is confirmed by high - resolution X - ray structures 8 , 16 . We therefore expected that high - quality EM maps with well - fit backbone models would be enriched in density peaks near the rotameric (cid:67) 1 dihedral ( N - C (cid:65) - C (cid:66) - C (cid:71) ) angles of 60° , 180° and 300° ( − 60° ) 17 . However , there are several reasons , including noise in the map or an inaccurate model , that a side chain peak might occur at a nonrotameric angle . For example , Gln519 of TrpV1 ( ref . 18 ) ( PDB 3J5P ) is modeled in a rotameric position but has a peak at a nonro - tameric angle in a 3 . 27 - Å resolution map ( EMDB 5778 ) ( Fig . 1a , b ) . We observed singular peaks for most side chains in the TrpV1 map , which further suggests that noise is not the main reason that the peak occurs in a nonrotameric position . Alternatively , a peak in a nonrotameric position can indicate that the model is incorrect . If the N , C (cid:65) and C (cid:66) atoms are positioned incorrectly in the strong potential surrounding the backbone , EMRinger will measure the map values in the wrong locations . It is important to note that this occurs even when the side chain is already modeled as rotameric .

We report EMRinger , a tool that assesses the precise ﬁtting of an atomic model into the map during reﬁnement and shows how radiation damage alters scattering from negatively charged amino acids . EMRinger ( https : / / github . com / fraser - lab / EMRinger ) will be useful for monitoring progress in resolving and modeling high - resolution features in cryo - EM . Recent computational and experimental developments in single - particle cryo - EM now make it possible , in some cases , to build atomic models of proteins and protein assemblies without using any reference structures 1 . Because such structures are often inac - cessible to X - ray crystallography or NMR 2 , it is important to determine the reliability of the resulting atomic models , and in particular side chain placement , for their eventual use in directing detailed mechanistic studies or drug development 3 . Validation of all - atom de novo cryo - EM models presents several unique challenges 4 . First , the Coulomb potential map must be validated through assessment of the ‘gold standard’ Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) between two independently refined half - maps 5 . The chemical reasonableness of the model must then be assessed with tools commonly applied in X - ray crystallography 6 . As in crystallography , it is essential to balance the agreement to experimental data with the deviation from ideal geometry while maintaining acceptable stereochemistry , Ramachandran statistics 7 , side chain rotamers 8 and clash scores 6 . The weighting between data and prior structural knowledge is key to the third step of model - to - map validation : determin - ing whether the structure is accurately fitted , but not over - fitted , to the map 9 .

In contrast , a small backbone adjustment places the C (cid:71) in the map value peak while maintaining a rotameric side chain model , excellent stereochemistry and a good map correlation ( Fig . 1e , f ) . To test the quality of model to map fit , we quantified the enrich - ment of EMRinger peaks in rotameric regions ( within 30° of 60° , 180° or 300° ) as a function of map value . We recorded the position and map value of the peak for each side chain (cid:67) 1 angle in the 3 . 2 - Å resolution 20S proteasome map ( EMDB 5623 , PDB 3J9I ) and observed that the distribution becomes more sharply peaked as the map value cutoff increases ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . At lower cutoffs , noise flattened the results , with less enrichment for peaks in rotameric regions . Although rotameric regions are sampled more at higher cutoffs , fewer residues had local map value peaks above these cutoffs , and noise from count - ing statistics dominated ( Fig . 2b ) . To quantify the relationship between sample size and rotameric enrichment , we used the normal approximation to the binomial distribution to generate a model - length independent validation statistic : the EMRinger score ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . For the 20S proteasome , the EMRinger score was maximized at the 0 . 242 normalized map value cutoff , and the signal was dominated by 1 , 547 rota - meric map value peaks , compared to 555 nonrotameric peaks ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . EMRinger scores are always calculated with a sampling angle of 5° to avoid inconsistent scoring and are for the most part independent of grid spacing changes owing to binning ( Supplementary Fig . 4b – d ) . We then sampled a series of cryo - EM maps deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank ( EMDB ) spanning a resolution range of 3 – 5 Å , with atomic models built into the map density ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Because a random distri - bution should produce an EMRinger score of 0 , the trend sug - gests that the (cid:67) 1 angle of side chains can be resolved at 4 . 5 - Å resolution or better . We observed similar trends in decreasing EMRinger score as maps of the T20S proteasome were progres - sively low - pass filtered ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . We observed a notable exception to the trend of increasing score with higher resolution in TrpV1 ( ref . 18 ) ( Fig . 2d ) , which had a low EMRinger score ( 0 . 56 ) despite its high - resolution map ( 3 . 27 Å ) . This de novo model was built manually and not subject to real - or reciprocal - space refinement . When we excluded the poorly resolved ankyrin domain of TrpV1 , the EMringer score increased to 1 . 17 , Original a b 121086 M ap v a l ue 420 0 60 120 180 (cid:1) 1 angle ( (cid:2) ) 240 300 360 Dihedral corrected c d 121086 M ap v a l ue 420 0 60 120 180 (cid:1) 1 angle ( (cid:2) ) 240 30 0 36 0 Backbone corrected f e 121086 M ap v a l ue 420 0 60 12 0 18 0 (cid:1) 1 angle ( (cid:2) ) 24 0 30 0 36 0 Figure 1 | EMRinger (cid:67) 1 map value sampling reports on backbone position and guides side chain conformation .

NATURE METHODS | ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION | 3 BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS as only the atoms modeled into the highest - resolution data remain ( Supplementary Fig . 1c and Supplementary Table 1 ) . We found that further rebuilding and refinement using Rosetta iterative local rebuilding 19 gradually improved the EMRinger score in most trials ( Supplementary Figs . 5 and 6a ) . The best Rosetta trajectory improved the EMRinger score to 2 . 58 , whereas the validation metrics for an independent reconstruction improved by a small margin ( Table 1 and Supplementary Figs . 5 and 6b ) . In contrast to existing measures , including real - space correlation or FSC 11 , the EMRinger score was sensitive to features at lower map values , amplifying improvements in the model that show only a minor impact in the agreement - to - density term used by Rosetta refinement ( Table 1 ) . These results demonstrate how small corrections of backbone position along secondary structures , introduced through independently scored refinement procedures , can lead to improvements in the EMRinger score and the accuracy of the resulting model ( Supplementary Fig . 6c , d ) . Recent motion - corrected analyses have indicated that high - resolution informa - tion degrades as a function of total elec - tron dose , probably as a result of radiation damage 20 , and that the signal in the 5 - Å shell degrades rapidly in the second half of data collection 21 . In addition to these global metrics , previous work has hypoth - esized that differential radiation damage causes negatively charged glutamate and aspartate residues to have weaker den - sity than neutral but similarly shaped glutamine and asparagine residues 20 , 22 , 23 . To quantify the effect of radiation damage on the high - resolution features of the map and to address whether effects vary by residue type , we applied EMRinger to analyze dose - fractionated maps of the T20S protea - some . The overall EMRinger score degraded as a function of dose , with a sharp loss of signal beginning around the fifteenth frame , corresponding to a total dose of ~ 18 e − / Å 2 ( Fig . 3a ) . Amino acids with charged side chains generally lost signal as a function of dose more quickly than average , whereas aromatic residues were much more resistant to degradation ( Fig . 3a ) . Most notably , negatively charged side chains lost signal much faster than positively charged side chains , with EMRinger score dropping to 0 by the map containing frames 6 – 10 . Because a map comprising only noise ( in the extreme of radiation damage ) should result in a score of 0 , differential damage is not sufficient to explain negative EMRinger scores observed in later frames . We observed that the initial map value peaks for some negatively charged residues inverted and became local minimums in later frames ( Fig . 3b , c ) . This behavior is in contrast to the flattening effect , where a peak slowly degrades into noise , seen generally for other residue types ( Fig . 3d , e ) . The inversion of the peak may result from the electron - scattering factors of negatively charged oxygen atoms , which are positive at high resolution but become negative at low resolution 24 . The net effect of the negative scattering behavior could therefore result in an enrichment of peaks Table 1 | Statistics before and after refinement Unreﬁned Unreﬁned ( transmembrane region ) Intermediate reﬁnement Final reﬁnement CC ( 3 . 27 - Å cutoff ) 0 . 676 0 . 726 0 . 715 0 . 728 CC ( training map ) 0 . 663 0 . 715 0 . 708 0 . 718 CC ( testing map ) 0 . 664 0 . 714 0 . 705 0 . 713 Integrated model - map FSC ( 15 – 3 . 4 Å ) 0 . 473 0 . 553 0 . 513 0 . 526 All - atom clash score ( MolProbity ) 77 . 90 100 . 78 2 . 32 2 . 09 Modeled rotamer outliers ( MolProbity ) 26 . 6 % 30 . 94 % 0 . 35 % 0 % EMRinger score 0 . 56 1 . 17 1 . 61 2 . 58 Cross - correlation , FSC mask19 , MolProbity scores and EMRinger scores for the full , unreﬁned TrpV1 model ( EMDB 5778 , PDB 3J5P ) , the transmembrane domain of the unreﬁned model , an intermediate model during reﬁnement of the transmembrane region and the ﬁnal reﬁned transmembrane region .

Recent dramatic advances in cryo - EM have created new challenges in building , refining and validating atomic models . EMRinger extends and complements existing cryo - EM validation procedures in multiple ways . Whereas current methods 6 test con - formational features independently of agreement with the map , EMRinger tests these features by querying the model and map together . The EMRinger score reports specifically on statistical signatures in high - resolution data . To validate the model - to - map correctness of atomic models from cryo - EM , refinement should result in EMRinger scores above 1 . 0 for well - refined structures with maps in the 3 - to 4 - Å range . EMRinger scores can be used in concert with cross - validation procedures 11 and other measures , such as gold - standard FSC - based resolution 4 and MolProbity statistics 6 . EMRinger scores can quantify improvements in the resolvability of atomic features owing to improvements to motion - correction algorithms , new data collection procedures that balance dose and radiation damage , and classification of particles representing distinct biochemical states 25 . Additionally , the high sensitivity of EMRinger suggests a natu - ral direction for model building and refinement . At the resolu - tions commonly used for model building in EM , many closely related backbone conformations can fit the map density with nearly equal agreement . Given a nearly finalized backbone posi - tion , side chains with nonrotameric peaks can be adjusted to fix the C (cid:71) atom in the peak density . Subsequently , the backbone conformation and closure to adjacent residues can be optimized to maintain a rotameric side chain conformation , similarly to the inverse rotamer approach used in some protein design applications 26 . Similar approaches to quantifying statistical signatures in weakly resolved data may also prove helpful for modeling of non – amino acid structures at lower resolutions , including glycans and nucleic acids 27 , 28 .

The scripts are also available in Supplementary Software . Map values . We loaded CCP4 - formatted maps using cctbx 29 and used the map voxel values without normalization , sharp - ening , filtering or other map manipulation . The wide range of normalization procedures used in constructing these maps explains the large differences in cutoff values used for differ - ent model - map pairs in our study . However , because EMRinger calculations are based on the relative values of a single map , we can compare EMRinger scores between maps without further normalization . EMRinger map sampling and analysis . EMRinger , as imple - mented in the Phenix software package 29 , is an extension of the Ringer protocol developed previously 13 , 14 . Ringer iteratively rotates side chain dihedral angles , interpolating the density at the terminal atom as it is rotated . We adapted EMRinger to work with real - space maps and to rotate the C (cid:71) atom by increments of 5° around the (cid:67) 1 dihedral angle ( starting at 0° relative to the amide nitrogen ) . EMRinger calculates and records the map value from a potential map at the position of the C (cid:71) atom at each increment using the eight - point interpolation function supplied by Phenix . From this scan , EMRinger records the peak map value and the angle at which it is achieved . These peak map values and angles are used for all further tools in the EMRinger package . EMRinger is available as phenix . emringer in Phenix ( version dev - 2016 or later ) .

We sampled all non - (cid:71) - branched , non - proline amino acids with a non - H (cid:71) atom , and measured the percent of map value peaks that are within at most 30° of 60° , 180° or 300° ( which we classify as rotameric ) . With map values sampled every 5° , this leads to a total of 39 angle bins that are considered rotameric and 33 that are considered nonrotameric . The extra rotameric bins are due to cases that are exactly 30° away from the central angle of a bin , which are considered rotameric . In order to separate the effects of peaks called from noise from peaks found in the density , we filtered peaks by a map value cutoff . If the map value of a peak is above this cutoff , it is interpreted as likely to be signal and therefore reporting correctly on the backbone position . Map values below this cutoff are discarded . Rather than relying on a user - selected map value cutoff , EMRinger chooses a range of 20 cutoffs , sampling linearly from the average map value across all scanned residues to the maximum map value measured across all scanned residues , and calculates statistics about the distribution for each possible cutoff . To determine the significance of this distribution , we calculated a Z - score based on a normal approximation to the binomial dis - tribution ( equation ( 1 ) ) . Z - score Number rotameric Number above threshold threshold (cid:29) (cid:13) (cid:114) 39 72 339 72 1 39 72 (cid:13) (cid:164)(cid:166) (cid:179)(cid:181) (cid:114) Number above threshold Number rotameric is the number of peaks above the cutoff that had rotameric chi angles , and number above cutoff is the total number of peaks above the cutoff . 39 / 72 is the distribution for the null hypothesis as predicted by the binomial distribution for 72 bins with 39 rotameric choices . To compare Z - scores between models of different structures , the Z - score is rescaled to the EMRinger score to account for the total number of amino acids in the model ( equation ( 2 ) ) . EMRinger score 10 - score Model length threshold threshold (cid:29) (cid:114) Z Z - score is the output of equation ( 1 ) . Model length is the total number of amino acids in the model that were scanned by EMRinger regardless of cutoff : all non – (cid:71) - branched , non - proline amino acids with a modeled non - H (cid:71) atom . EMRinger repeats these calculations across the range of map value cutoffs . The highest score calculated across this range of cutoffs is returned as the EMRinger score for the model - map pair . Because of this multiple testing and the correction to account for varying model length , the final EMRinger score should not be used as a Z - score for statistical purposes . EMRinger score does not change when the model and map are multiplied ( for example , in the case of a polymer with high symmetry ) , so that the score is definitive and no questions arise of how many monomers should be included in the analysis . An EMRinger score of 1 . 0 sets an initial quality goal for a model refined against a map in the 3 . 2 – 3 . 5 Å range , whereas very high - quality models at high resolution generate scores above 2 . 0 . Maps that are highly variable in resolution may have lower EMRinger scores unless poorly resolved regions of the map are masked out and excluded from the model . Calculation of the EMRinger score is performed by the emringer _ score . py script ( https : / / github . com / fraser - lab / EMRinger and Supplementary Software ) . Rolling window EMRinger analysis . In order to quantify the local contributions to the EMRinger score , we perform EMRinger analysis on rolling 21 - residue windows along the primary sequence of proteins . For each window , we calculated the fraction of residues whose peaks were rotameric . These values were plot - ted as a function of the window position and compared between different models of a protein to distinguish regions of improved model quality . Rolling window EMRinger analysis is performed by the emringer _ rolling . py script ( https : / / github . com / fraser - lab / EMRinger and Supplementary Software ) .

Refinement of TrpV1 used an iterative local rebuilding procedure to improve local backbone geometry as well as fit to the experi - mental density data 19 . Refinement began with the deposited PDB structure of TrpV1 ( PDB 3J5P ) . The model was trimmed to the transmembrane region ( residues 381 – 695 ) , and bond angles and bond lengths were given ideal geometry . During local rebuilding , five cycles of backbone rebuilding were run ; in each cycle , regions with poor fit to density or poor local geometry were automati - cally identified , and rebuilding focused on these regions . Each rebuilding cycle was followed by side chain rotamer optimization and all - atom refinement with a physically realistic force field . Following this protocol , 1 , 000 independent trajectories were run , and the final model was selected by filtering on two criteria : first , the 800 most nonphysical models were eliminated by assessing each model against the Rosetta all - atom force field ; second , fit - to - density was used to rank models and select the best model from these 200 . Table statistics . The cross - correlation was calculated using Chimera’s ‘fit in map’ tool across all contours and using a resolution cutoff for the calculated map . The integrated FSC was calculated between the model and an independent reconstruction over a masked region covering the protein only . The mask was truncated at 6 - Å resolution , and we report the integrated FSC mask over high - resolution shells only ( 15 to ~ 3 . 4 Å ) . MolProbity statistics were calculated using the validate tool in Phenix nightly build 1894 . Radiation damage analysis . To identify the degradation of map signal with radiation damage , we used EMRinger with a single model across multiple dose - fractionated maps . Individual recon - structions were calculated on the basis of each of the 24 frames of data collected using the alignments generated from the full reconstruction in Frealign 21 . Five - frame averages were generated by voxel - by - voxel averaging between each of the five frames using the CCP4 ‘mapmask’ tool . For each five - frame averaged dose - fractionated map , the EMRinger score is calculated for the full model . We additionally calculated EMRinger scores for subsets of the model comprising only the aromatic , positively charged or negatively charged residues to compare the differential radiation damage effects for different amino acid classes . Radiation damage can lead to a negative scattering contribution near the true ( rotameric ) position in subsequent maps . Because the rotameric peak of the original map can therefore be lowered below the baseline , EMRinger will then identify a new peak at a different local maximum in the damaged map . This new local maximum is more likely to occur at nonrotameric angles because the original rotameric angle is now suppressed by negative scattering contribu - tions in the damaged map . The results of the EMRinger analysis on dose - fractionated data suggest that reconstructions based on different doses may be required to maximize the resolvability of different sets of side chains , just as different degrees of sharpening are commonly used now during model building . Residue - specific sampling was performed by the emringer _ residue . py script ( https : / / github . com / fraser - lab / EMRinger and Supplementary Software ) . Grid spacing adjustment . In order to change the grid spacing of maps to test the effect of grid spacing on EMRinger scores , real - space maps were first Fourier transformed to structure factors using phenix . map _ to _ structure _ factors 29 . The maps were then transformed back into real space with specified grid spacing using phenix . mtz2map with variations in grid _ resolution _ factor 29 to vary the grid spacing without affecting the resolution . 29 .

Histogram of peak counts for EMRinger scan of T20S Proteasome ( EMDB 5778 , PDB 3J9I ) at a map value cutoff of 0 . 242 e - / Å 3 . At this threshold , which maximizes the EMRinger score , 1547 rotameric peaks ( blue ) greatly outnumber 555 non - rotameric peaks ( red ) . Nature Methods : doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3541 Supplementary Figure 4 Controls to demonstrate how EMRinger score is affected by low - pass filtering , changes to grid spacing and adjustment of the sampling frequency . ( a ) EMRinger Score degrades rapidly with decreasing resolution . The T20S proteasome map ( EMDB 5623 , PDB 3J9I ) is low - pass filtered to resolutions ranging from 3 . 2 to 7 Å . EMRinger scores for each of these filtered maps show a resolution dependence and that by 5 Å resolution side chains are no longer distinguishable from noise and the EMRinger score is near 0 . ( b ) EMRinger scores are largely robust to changes in grid spacing . The T20S proteasome map is modified to have a range of adjusted grid spacing , and EMRinger score is calculated for each map against the deposited models . The EMRinger score decreases by a maximum of 17 % with a maximum increase of grid spacing before lowering resolution due to the Nyquist limit . ( c ) EMRinger score decreases with increased sampling angle . The EMRinger score is calculated with different sampling angles from 1º to 15º , with a null hypothesis based on the correct number of bins that are rotameric for each sampling angle and with a standard fixed null hypothesis of 50 % . This shows that EMRinger score decreases with Sampling Angle as a result of the changes in null hypothesis rather than significant differences in enrichment . ( d ) Interpretation of EMRinger score is not affected by choice of standard sampling angle of 5º . EMRinger scores were calculated for structures from table S1 at sampling angles of 1º and 5º and the results were compared . The linear correlation between the two ( R 2 = 0 . 98 ) sampling angles indicates that the comparison of scores will be the same regardless of sampling angle , so long as a single sampling angle is used for comparison .

Nature Methods : doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3541 Supplementary Figure 6 EMRinger scores report on effective refinement of atomic models into EM maps . ( a ) The EMRinger score improves during refinement . Rosetta refinement 29 trajectories for 9 trials are shown in light green with the final refinement shown in dark green . ( b ) Map value cutoff scan for the unrefined model of TrpV1 ( red , EMDB 5778 , PDB 3J5P ) , the transmembrane region of the deposited TrpV1 model ( orange ) , and for the model of TrpV1 refined by Rosetta ( green , PDB 3J9J ) show the improvement during refinement . ( c ) Analyzing the unrefined ( red ) and refined ( green ) models in the transmembrane region highlights how portions of the model experience dramatic increases in rotameric peaks after refinement . ( d ) The unrefined ( red ) and refined ( green ) TrpV1 models are shown in density ( isolevel of 10 ) , revealing that small shifts in the placement of backbone of the alpha helix improves EMRinger statistics . Nature Methods : doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3541 Table S1 | EMRinger analysis of selected maps above 5 Å resolution with atomic models . For the transmembrane - only scan of the TrpV1 Channel ( EMDB 5778 ) , residues 381 - 695 of each chain of the deposited model ( PDB 3J5P ) were used . For EMDB 2787 , the two deposited half - models ( PDB 4V19 , 4V1A ) were combined and run as a single model . The top scoring maps have scores above 3 . 0 : the T20S proteasome , which used a crystallographic model with minimal refinement with MDFF 1 , and the hepatitis B viral capsid , which was built de novo and refined using real space refinement in Phenix 2 . Both maps are consistently better than 3 . 5 Å local resolution 3 , likely reflecting the underlying rigidity of the complexes . Recent mammalian ribosome structures 4 , 5 , which are dynamic and have more variability in resolution , used masking to reconstruct the highest resolution regions . Refmac reciprocal - space refinement of de novo atomic models of these components results in EMRinger scores above 1 . 85 6 .
