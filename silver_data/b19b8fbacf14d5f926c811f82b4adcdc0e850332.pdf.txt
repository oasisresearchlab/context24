REVIEW Open Access Helicobacter pylori vacuolating toxin A and apoptosis Joachim Rassow Abstract VacA , the vacuolating cytotoxin A of Helicobacter pylori , induces apoptosis in epithelial cells of the gastic mucosa and in leukocytes . VacA is released by the bacteria as a protein of 88 kDa . At the outer surface of host cells , it binds to the sphingomyelin of lipid rafts . At least partially , binding to the cells is facilitated by different receptor proteins . VacA is internalized by a clathrin - independent mechanism and initially accumulates in GPI - anchored proteins - enriched early endosomal compartments . Together with early endosomes , VacA is distributed inside the cells . Most of the VacA is eventually contained in the membranes of vacuoles . VacA assembles in hexameric oligomers forming an anion channel of low conductivity with a preference for chloride ions . In parallel , a significant fraction of VacA can be transferred from endosomes to mitochondria in a process involving direct endosome - mitochondria juxtaposition . Inside the mitochondria , VacA accumulates in the mitochondrial inner membrane , probably forming similar chloride channels as observed in the vacuoles . Import into mitochondria is mediated by the hydrophobic N - terminus of VacA . Apoptosis is triggered by loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential , recruitment of Bax and Bak , and release of cytochrome c . Keywords : Helicobacter pylori , vacuolating cytotoxin A , apoptosis , lipid rafts , endosomes , vacuoles , mitochondrial targeting , mitochondrial inner membrane , ion channel , cytochrome c Review VacA , the vacuolating cytotoxin A , is one of the major virulence factors released by Helicobacter pylori . VacA is a protein of about 88 kDa that easily assembles in defined oligomeric complexes , forming anion channels in target membranes . The name refers to the capability of the toxin to cause a formation of large vacuoles in cultured cells [ 1 , 2 ] . However , VacA is also implicated in other activities , including interactions with the immune system , modifications of the permeability of polarized epithelial cell monolayers , and induction of apoptosis [ 3 , 4 ] . The first observations of VacA - dependent apopto - sis were published more than 10 years ago [ 5 , 6 ] . Since then , numerous projects on VacA were carried out , but it was difficult to reconcile the divergent results . Only recently , a unifying model is emerging [ 7 , 8 ] , suggesting that VacA - induced cell death is essentially dependent on a peculiar traffic route of VacA inside the host cells . In this review , we will first ask for the evidence that VacA is of any relevance for the induction of cell death in the infected tissues . The next section gives a short summary on the structure and the molecular properties of the toxin . The following sections give a detailed description of the traffic route of VacA : I , binding to target cells , II , lipid rafts and endocytosis , III , vacuola - tion , IV , mitochondria . In the final section , we will dis - cuss the possible relation between mitochondrial targeting and VacA acting as a trigger of apoptosis . The cellular effect : VacA triggers apoptosis H . pylori has a unique capability to survive in the mucus layer of the stomach . In many cases , the infection is acquired early in childhood and persists throughout the entire life of the host [ 3 , 8 ] . About 80 - 90 % of the bacteria are mobile within the mucus , a fraction of 10 - 20 % is found in direct contact with the surface of the epithelial cells [ 9 ] . Some bacteria may even enter host cells and survive for some time in an intracellular compartment [ 8 , 10 ] . Under normal physiological conditions , the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa are constantly Correspondence : joachim . rassow @ ruhr - uni - bochum . de Ruhr - Universität Bochum , Institut für Physiologische Chemie , Medizinische Fakultät , Gebäude MA3 , D - 44780 Bochum , Germany Rassow Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 26 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 26 © 2011 Rassow ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd .

The cells undergo apoptosis , the remnants are exfoliating into the gastric lumen [ 11 , 12 ] . The rate of this process is significantly increased upon infection by H . pylori [ 13 - 15 ] . Remarkably , even excessive apoptosis of the epithelial cells is not necessarily a reason for ulcer for - mation . In most cases , the integrity of the epithelium is maintained by the induction of a secondary hyperproli - ferative response . The mucosal cells are replaced by cells migrating from the neck segments of the gastric glands [ 16 ] . In fact , about half of the world population is infected by H . pylori , but only in about 15 % of the cases the infection causes peptic ulceration [ 17 - 19 ] . What is the reason for the increased rate of cell death in the presence of H . pylori ? Initial studies concentrated on a possible involvement of the CD95 ( APO - 1 / FAS ) system [ 20 - 22 ] . It was observed that infection with H . pylori entailed an enhanced Fas receptor expression . However , the reason of this effect was not clear . More - over , data on other pathogens demonstrated that bac - teria are able to trigger apoptosis by many different means , including specific effector proteins that act inside the host cells [ 23 ] . VacA was already known to be one of the major virulence factors of H . pylori , and it had been observed that VacA is able to enter different target cells . It was therefore tested if this protein may be suffi - cient to trigger apoptosis . In fact , several independent studies confirmed that cells incubated with purified VacA showed all signs of apoptosis [ 5 , 6 , 24 - 26 ] . It is now generally assumed that several effects contribute to apoptosis in H . pylori - infected tissues , including a con - tribution of the extrinsic , receptor - mediated pathway [ 27 - 29 ] . However , it is clear that H . pylori - induced apoptosis is also possible independently of death recep - tors [ 5 , 6 , 24 - 26 , 30 ] , and the VacA toxin appears to be the most prominent mediator [ 4 , 31 ] . VacA - dependent effects are also observed with leuko - cytes and it is well possible that this activity is of much higher pathological significance as compared to the enhanced turnover of the epithelial cells . Infection of the mucosa by H . pylori is accompanied with a significant disruption of the epithelial barrier function , permitting access of VacA to the gastric sub - mucosa [ 3 , 32 , 33 ] . Already very low concentrations of VacA are sufficient to causes an efficient inhibition of the proliferation of the T cells due to down - regulation of Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) transcription [ 34 - 37 ] . Moreover , the number of T cells can also be reduced indepen - dently of IL - 2 , possibly by apoptotic depletion [ 38 - 40 ] . Similar as with epithelial cells , apoptosis of T cells was originally thought to be due to death receptor signalling but later shown to be mediated by the mitochondrial pathway [ 30 ] . Apoptosis was reported both for T - and B - cell lines [ 41 ] . Moreover , H . pylori is also able to cause apoptosis of human monocytes and macrophages . Again , cell death appears to depend on a participation of mitochondrial factors [ 42 , 43 ] . There is some indica - tion that all subsets of leukocytes , including granulo - cytes and dendritic cells , may be susceptible to VacA [ 36 ] . However , there are also some data suggesting that in particular granulocytes and dendritic cells may be resistant against VacA - dependent apoptosis [ 42 , 44 ] . Although there is compelling evidence that H . pylori virulence factors are able to trigger apoptosis of different leukocytes if applied in vitro , data are lacking to esti - mate the relevance of leukocyte apoptosis and the role of VacA in the infected tissues . It was questioned if the density of H . pylori in the mucus layer is sufficient to achieve a sufficient concentration of VacA to trigger apoptosis of leukocytes in the submucosa [ 33 ] . However , the bacteria are obviously successful in establishing a state of drastic immune suppression in their immediate vicinity . It may be speculated that inhibition of IL - 2 activities and induction of apoptosis correspond to two different lines of defence which allow the bacteria to survive in the immediate neighbourhood of a chronic inflammation . The structure : VacA forms hexameric anion channels What are the features that enable VacA to trigger cell death ? VacA is initially synthesized in the bacteria as a single polypeptide of about 140 kDa , in most cases com - prising 1 . 287 residues [ 45 - 48 ] . The protein is subse - quently released by type V - secretion . In this context , the N - terminal leader sequence of 33 residues and the C - terminal autotransporter domain of about 33 kDa are cleaved , yielding a mature toxin of 88 . 2 kDa [ 49 ] . The polypeptide can be further processed into an N - terminal fragment of 33 . 4 kDa ( named p34 or p37 , residues 1 - 311 ) and a C - terminal fragment of 54 . 8 kDa ( named p55 or p58 , comprising residues 320 - 821 ) , both parts stay associated by non - covalent interactions . The rele - vance of the cleavage is not clear , it is not required for VacA activity . However , many data have shown that the N - terminal domain is essential in the toxic activity of VacA while the C - terminal domain is essential in bind - ing to target membranes [ 3 , 4 ] . VacA is able to assemble in flower - shaped hexameric structures . These can form both free in solution and after insertion in membranes . The complexes can have a mass of nearly 1000 kDa , indicating that they may con - tain 12 VacA polypeptides [ 50 - 52 ] . The complexes prob - ably form by association of two donut - like hexamers . They dissociate into monomers at pH < 4 . 5 [ 51 ] . At least under some conditions , VacA also forms stable heptameric complexes , however , hexamers represent the dominant form of the toxin [ 52 ] . Rassow Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 26 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 26 Page 2 of 9 Probably the most important feature of the VacA toxin is its capability to form anion channels of low con - ductivity [ 53 - 55 ] . Oligomeric VacA can act as a chloride channel of about 10 pS . The conductivity is completely inhibited by the nonspecific chloride channel blocker NPPB ( 5 - nitro - 2 - ( 3 - phenylpropylamino ) benzoic acid [ 55 , 56 ] . N - terminal segments of p58 may be involved in pore formation [ 57 ] , however , we recently found that isolated p34 alone is sufficient to form the ion channel [ 58 ] . Unfortunately , so far no crystal structure of the holo - toxin was resolved . The N - terminal part of VacA is prone to aggregation , making it difficult to obtain crys - tals . The structure of the ion - conducting channel is therefore unknown . The C - terminal parts of VacA were crystallized separately some years ago , the structure revealed an impressive array of b - sheets [ 59 ] . Eventually , it should be noted that not only the precise structure of VacA is unknown , but also the topology of the VacA complexes in membranes . The determination of the VacA structure and membrane topology is still one of the big challenges in the field of VacA research . The traffic route : ( I ) Binding of VacA to target cells Electrophysiological studies showed a successful integra - tion of functional VacA into artificial membranes in the absence of any accessory proteins . However , targeting to host cells is obviously facilitated by distinct receptor structures [ 60 ] : Epithelial cells Association of VacA with epithelial cells was found to involve interactions with RPTP a and RPTP b , two struc - turally unrelated receptor - like protein tyrosine phospha - tases [ 61 - 65 ] . The relevance of VacA binding to these phosphatases was questioned because it is unclear if binding of VacA to RPTP a or RPTP b has a significant impact on subsequent signalling or protein traffic [ 66 ] . However , it was reported that mice deficient in RPTP b show a remarkable resistance to gastric ulcer induction by VacA [ 67 ] , suggesting that at least RPTP b may play a substantial role in VacA toxicity . Leukocytes Binding of VacA to T - cells and subsequent endocytosis were reported to be mediated by the integrin b 2 subunit CD18 [ 36 ] . Together with the integrin a subunit CD11a , CD18 forms a heterodimeric transmembrane receptor on T cells named LFA - 1 ( lymphocyte function - asso - ciated antigen - 1 ) . Interestingly , the same protein was also reported to bind the leukotoxin of the dental patho - gen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans [ 68 ] and the Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin ( CyaA ) [ 69 ] . LFA - 1 is also exposed on the surface of other leukocytes , including granulocytes , macrophages , dendri - tic cells , B cells and NK cells , suggesting that the affinity for LFA - 1 may be of general importance in the immun - suppressive effects of VacA [ 36 ] . However , also the functional consequences of VacA binding to LFA - 1 are a matter of debate . It was argued that it is not suffi - ciently clear if LFA - 1 primarily acts as a mediator of VacA endocytosis , or if LFA - 1 is merely a mediator of intracellular signalling pathways [ 8 ] . Interestingly , new data have recently shown that uptake of VacA by T cells requires phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of CD18 , catalyzed by members of the protein kinase C ( PKC ) family [ 37 ] . There is evidence that also RPTP a may be phosphorylated by PKCs , indicating the possibi - lity of a common mechanism of VacA internalization both in leukocytes and in epithelial cells [ 37 ] . Although both LFA - 1 and the phosphatases RPTP a and RPTP b are components of signal transduction sys - tems , there seems to be no direct participation in a sig - nalling pathway leading to VacA - dependent apoptosis . However , binding to receptor proteins may strongly facilitate the endocytosis of VacA ( Figure 1 ) . The traffic route : ( II ) Lipid rafts and endocytosis It has been known for a long time that after binding to a cell surface , VacA can efficiently be internalized [ 70 ] . The toxin is subsequently found in endosomes , the pro - cess is clathrin - independent [ 71 ] . In spite of uncertain - ties regarding the precise role of cellular receptor proteins , there is a general consensus with respect to lipid rafts as major site for uptake of VacA [ 8 , 60 , 65 , 72 , 73 ] . Sphingomyelin , a key component of the lipid rafts , was demonstrated to bind VacA directly and to facilitate its internalization [ 66 ] . VacA also binds to several glycosphingolipids , at least in vitro [ 74 ] , but the relevance of this affinity for VacA toxicity has not been clarified . Already in 2000 it was found that uptake of VacA depends on the presence of GPI - anchored proteins ( gly - cosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins ) in the membrane [ 71 ] . GPI - anchored proteins can be delivered to a special subset of endosomes via a distinct Cdc42 - dependent , clathrin - independent pinocytic pathway [ 75 ] . VacA was shown to follow this pathway and to accumu - late in the corresponding GPI - anchored proteins - enriched early endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) [ 76 - 78 ] . Most GPI - anchored are subsequently recycled back to the plasma membrane . VacA avoids this step and accumulates in early endosomes that are character - ized by their coating with the small GTPase Rab5 . Surprisingly , the VacA - containing early endosomes attract actin , and are subsequently moved inside the cytosol by F - actin comet tails [ 78 ] . The actin assembles preferentially at one side of an endosome , and the Rassow Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 26 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 26 Page 3 of 9 endosome is then propelled forward by the growth of the actin fibers . The principle of motility is similar to the mechanism of F - actin - dependent movements of Lis - teria monocytogenes inside the cytosol of host cells [ 79 ] . If the formation of F - actin is blocked , the mobility and all subsequent steps of toxicity are inhibited [ 78 ] . If actin - mediated mobility is permitted , VacA takes at least two different pathways : ( 1 . ) Most of VacA is subse - quently found in vesicles that are labelled by the small GTPase Rab7 and thus defined as late endosomes . Accumulation in late endosomes initiates the formation of the vacuoles that were the reason to name the toxin the “ vacuolating cytotoxin ” . ( 2 . ) In parallel , a smaller fraction of VacA can be transferred from the early endo - somes to mitochondria . By interactions with mitochon - dria , VacA eventually has the opportunity to trigger apoptosis . The traffic route : ( III ) Vacuolation If purified VacA is added to cells in culture medium , a high number of vacuoles emerge inside the cells [ 3 , 4 ] . It is conceivable that this drastic effect may significantly contribute to the toxicity of VacA in the infected mucosa , but surprisingly little is known about the impact of the vacuolation in vivo . The vacuoles resemble late endosomes , in particular they are covered with the small GTP - binding protein Rab7 and they contain V - type ATPases [ 80 - 83 ] . VacA was shown to primarily mediate an influx of chloride ions into the endosomes . The accumulation of negatively charged chloride ions inside the endosomes strongly facilitates the activity of the V - type ATPases . VacA thereby indirectly increases the ATP - dependent acidification of the endosomes . Due to the strong acidification , weak bases are easily trapped inside the endosomes , eventually causing an osmotic swelling of the organelles [ 83 ] . There are some data indicating that VacA may also act as a mediator of pyruvate transport [ 83 ] . However , the conductivity of the VacA ion channel is extremely low , suggesting that the inner diameter of the channel should be too small to accommodate complex molecules such as pyruvate or other organic acids [ 58 ] . Perhaps the discrepancies will be resolved once the precise struc - ture of the VacA complexes has been elucidated . The possible permeability of VacA for pyruvate is also of relevance with respect to the question if VacA in the plasma membrane is able to mediating a release of monomeric VacA binding to sphingomyelin of lipid rafts receptor protein Cl (cid:237) Cdc42 - dependent endocytosis GPI - anchored proteins - enriched compartment ( GEEC ) early endosome binding Rab5 , binding of actin motility in the cytosol formation of Rab7 - positive late endosomes containing V - type ATPases formation of vacuoles endosome - mitochondria juxtaposition formation of chloride channels in mitochondrial inner membrane loss of membrane potential , recruitment of Bax and Bak TOM Pathway to apoptosis Pathway to formation of vacuoles apoptosis Figure 1 Traffic of VacA . Uptake of VacA into host cells is initiated by binding to lipid rafts . This step can be facilitated by receptor proteins ( such as the receptor - like protein tyrosine phosphatases RPTP a and RPTP b , or - on the surface of leukocytes - by the integrin b 2 subunit CD18 ) . Inside the lipid rafts , VacA binds to sphingomyelin . Subsequent endocytosis is dependent on Cdc42 , a small GTPase of the Rho subfamily . The endocytosis is independent of clathrin . VacA accumulates in an early endosomal compartment enriched in GPI - anchored proteins ( GEEC ) . The endosomes recruit cytosolic actin which forms comet - like structures . Growth of the actin fibers causes a significant motility of the endosomes in the cell . Fractions of the endosomes bind the small GTPase Rab5 and are therefore classified as early endosomes . The early endosomes undergo maturation to late endosomes , releasing Rab5 and binding Rab7 . VacA in cooperation with V - type ATPases causes swelling of the endosomes and thereby a formation of vacuoles . In parallel , a fraction of the early endosomes attaches to the surface of mitochondria and VacA is transferred . VacA eventually accumulates in the mitochondrial inner membrane , forming chloride channels . Dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential causes recruitment of Bax and Bak , release of cytochrome c , and apoptosis .

Eventually , the perme - ability of VacA also determines the possible activities of VacA in mitochondria . The traffic route : ( IV ) Mitochondria For a long time , intracellular VacA was only detected in endosomes and in vacuoles . The first attempts to express VacA in the cytosol of HeLa cells confirmed this concept . VacA was found to co - localize with the V - ATPases in the membranes of vacuoles [ 84 ] . A few years later , the group of Patrice Boquet decided to express different fusion proteins of VacA containing a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) domain in HeLa cells and to determine their distribution . Surprisingly , the experiments indicated that VacA or parts of VacA may be transported to mitochondria [ 5 ] . It was found that the C - terminal part of VacA ( named p55 or p58 ) was retained in the cytosol . However , the N - terminal part of VacA ( named p34 or p37 ) localized to mitochondria , at least if a GFP moiety was attached to the N - terminus . Moreover , the experiments revealed that constructs of p34 carrying the GFP moiety at the C - terminus - and thus exposing a free N - terminus - triggered apoptosis of the cells . Apoptosis was initiated by release of cyto - chrome c , it could be inhibited by Bcl - 2 [ 5 ] . However , in these experiments , the VacA constructs were only shown to target mitochondria if synthesized in the cytosol . Unfortunately , it was completely unclear how VacA may ever encounter mitochondria if provided by bacteria , or if contained in endosomes . Independent studies then confirmed that purified VacA was an effi - cient mediator of apoptosis if added to intact cells from the outside [ 6 , 24 ] , and a series of carefully conducted studies demonstrated that externally added VacA was indeed transported to mitochondria , causing dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential , release of cytochrome c and apoptosis [ 25 , 26 , 85 ] . Although it was obvious that VacA can trigger apop - tosis by interactions with mitochondria , the molecular mechanisms continued to be enigmatic [ 4 , 31 ] . Several questions were completely unclear : What is the mito - chondrial targeting signal of VacA ? What is the target structure of VacA inside the mitochondria ? What is the pathway of VacA from the plasma membrane to the mitochondria ? What is the mechanism of cytochrome c release if VacA enters mitochondria ? These questions were recently addressed by several new studies . What is the mitochondrial targeting signal of VacA ? The biogenesis of endogenous mitochondrial proteins is very well characterized [ 86 , 87 ] . Several different mito - chondrial targeting signals have been identified . These can be located at the N - terminus or at the C - terminus of a protein , and also internal targeting signals are known [ 87 ] . No such signal sequence is contained in the primary structure of VacA . By testing different segments of VacA for mitochondrial targeting in intact cells and in a cell - free system in vitro , it turned out that the 32 amino acid residues of the VacA N - terminus are neces - sary and sufficient for targeting to mitochondria [ 58 ] . This part of VacA represents a new and peculiar mitochondrial targeting sequence , there are no obvious similarities to any endogenous mitochondrial proteins . The mitochondrial targeting sequence of VacA does not contain any charged residues , most residues are hydrophobic . The sequence targets VacA to the TOM complex of the mitochondrial outer membrane ( the translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane ) which mediates the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins from the cytosol . The VacA N - terminus had previously been known to be essential in the formation of vacuoles [ 3 , 4 ] , and it had been suggested that the N - terminus may form the ion channel in VacA oligo - mers [ 88 ] . However , the more recent data indicate that pore - formation by VacA is independent of the N - ter - minus . It was found that the N - terminal domain of VacA ( p34 , residues 1 - 311 ) is able to form the charac - teristic anion channel of low conductivity even if the N - terminal residues 1 - 32 are completely deleted [ 58 ] . It is therefore conceivable that the hydrophobic VacA N - terminus primarily serves as a targeting signal and as a mediator of membrane insertion . In fact , there is some experimental evidence that the VacA N - terminus is also in vacuoles primarily required for efficient membrane insertion and not for oligomerization or pore formation [ 89 ] . What is the target structure of VacA inside the mitochondria ? The hydrophobic N - terminus of the VacA toxin is not simply a mediator of unspecific insertion into the mito - chondrial outer membrane . Two independent studies found that VacA seems to exclusively accumulate in the mitochondrial inner membrane [ 58 , 90 ] . The mechanism that directs VacA specifically to the inner membrane is still unknown . However , the localization has important implications . Import of VacA into mitochondria quickly entails a dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential [ 5 , 25 ] . This effect is probably caused by the conductivity of the VacA ion channel in the inner mem - brane . In a first step , chloride ions should diffuse into the mitochondrial matrix , causing a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential . In a second step , the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain appears to be compromised , causing an irreversible loss of the mem - brane potential . Rassow Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 26 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 26 Page 5 of 9 What is the pathway of VacA from the plasma membrane to the mitochondria ? For 10 years it had been difficult to reconcile the actions of VacA on mitochondria with the obvious tendency of externally added VacA to accumulate in endosomes . The study of Gauthier et al . ( ref . [ 78 ] ) demonstrated a striking mobility of the endosomes in the cytosol , raising the question if VacA may be transferred from the endo - somes to mitochondria upon direct contact . Experimen - tal evidence supporting this possibility was provided only recently by a highly significant study [ 91 ] . The authors investigated the pathway of externally added VacA from the plasma membrane into the interior of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and determined the intra - cellular location of VacA at different time points . In these experiments , VacA - containing endosomes were observed in direct contact with mitochondria . The endo - some - mitochondria juxtaposition was strictly dependent on VacA , but surprisingly also on a recruitment of Bax and Bak to the endosomal membranes . After about 12 hours , significant amounts of VacA were detected in the mitochondrial fraction , clearly preceding the induction of apoptosis . The transfer to mitochondria was comple - tely blocked with mutant versions of VacA containing an amino acid exchange within the N - terminal 32 resi - dues ( P9A or G14A , respectively ) . Based on previous assumptions , the authors proposed that the transfer might be dependent on the VacA channel activity . How - ever , taking into account the notion of the VacA N - ter - minus acting as a targeting signal [ 58 ] , it is more likely that the N - terminus is involved in direct interactions with the mitochondrial protein import machinery [ 7 ] . Eventually , it is also remarkable that the authors showed a transfer of the entire holo - toxin to the mitochondria . In previous studies it had been unclear if the complete VacA , or possibly only the toxic N - terminal domain enters the mitochondria . The mechanism of cytochrome c release : VacA and apoptosis Why is apoptosis a consequence of VacA import into mitochondria ? As discussed in this review , there is now direct evidence of VacA targeting the mitochondrial inner membrane , and ample evidence of VacA forming anion channels . An enzymatic activity of VacA seems to be lacking , and there is no indication that VacA may act by direct interactions with cellular enzymes or protein complexes that are directly involved in the regulation of the cell cycle . Hence , the formation of an anion channel of low conductivity in the mitochondrial inner mem - brane is currently the only activity of VacA in mito - chondria that is supported by the available data . If this is true , VacA - dependent apoptosis should efficiently be blocked by reagents that block the VacA channel activity . Interestingly , experiments of this type have already been conducted . NPPB ( 5 - nitro - 2 - [ 3 - phenylpro - pylamino ] benzoic acid ) is a chloride channel blocker that completely inhibits the conductivity of VacA [ 58 , 92 , 93 ] . If cells are pre - incubated with this reagent , they are resistant against VacA - dependent apoptosis [ 25 ] . This correlation is currently the best evidence of an essential role of the VacA ion channel in VacA - dependent apoptosis . Strikingly , H . pylori itself is able to actively suppress the apoptotic action of its VacA toxin . Cells that receive the H . pylori CagA protein ( by type IV - secretion ; see the contribution of S . Backert in this issue ) are resistant against VacA . CagA initiates a signalling cascade that stops the uptake of VacA in an early step , probably in the GPI - anchored proteins - enriched early endosomal compartments [ 94 ] . The effect of CagA confirms the relevance of an unrestricted access of VacA to mito - chondria in VacA - induced apoptosis . Concerning the mechanistic relation of ion channel formation in the mitochondrial inner membrane to sub - sequent apoptosis , essentially three points have been clarified : ( i ) Import of VacA causes loss of the mito - chondrial membrane potential [ 5 , 25 , 85 ] , ( ii ) members of the Bcl - 2 family , including Bax and Bak are intrinsically involved in VacA - dependent apoptosis [ 5 , 26 , 29 , 30 , 91 , 95 ] , and ( iii ) cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins are released into the cytosol [ 5 , 26 , 29 , 31 , 85 ] . Unfortunately , data are lacking to explain why chlor - ide influx into the mitochondrial matrix causes Bax and Bak recruitment at the mitochondrial outer surface . The functional relation of these two events is currently the missing link in research on VacA - induced apoptosis . It is known that any dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential can be sufficient to cause dramatic structural changes within the mitochondria , including a significant redistribution of pro - apoptotic factors [ 96 - 98 ] . However , it seems to be difficult to explain these consequences in molecular terms . The difficulties are in part due to the fact that in general only very little is known about the communication between the mito - chondrial inner and outer membrane . Further research on the functions of the VacA toxin is required to eluci - date this relation . Conclusions The epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa undergo apop - tosis after a few days irrespective of any infection . In the beginning it was therefore difficult to determine if H . pylori interferes with this process by specific means or only as an unspecific mediator of inflammation . It is now well established that H . pylori can trigger apoptosis both by the death receptor pathway and by the Rassow Cell Communication and Signaling 2011 , 9 : 26 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 9 / 1 / 26 Page 6 of 9 mitochondrial pathway . In recent years , the mitochon - drial pathway received most attention after if had been found that the VacA toxin of H . pylori can efficiently trigger apoptosis by direct interactions with mitochon - dria . The pathway of VacA from the plasma membrane to the mitochondria of the host cells had been enigmatic for 10 years . Most data suggested that VacA should bypass the mitochondria and accumulate exclusively in late endosomes . Only very recently , in this respect sev - eral important questions could be answered ( Figure 1 ) : Following uptake at lipid rafts , VacA is contained in GPI - anchored proteins - enriched early endosomal com - partments . VacA appears to stay in endosomal mem - branes , there is no evidence that substantial amounts of VacA are released into the cytosol . However , early endo - somes containg VacA can recruit actin at their outer surface , tails of F - actin can form at one pole of the endosomes , and together with the endosomes , VacA has a remarkable motility inside the cell . VacA is transferred to mitochondria in direct contact between endosomes and mitochondria . Inside the mitochondria , VacA accu - mulates in the inner membrane , obviously forming an anion channel of low conductivity . Subsequent apoptosis is essentially a consequence of the formation of a chlor - ide channel in the mitochondrial inner membrane . Transfer to the mitochondria and insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane is mediated by the VacA N - terminus . Apotosis is initiated by dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential , recruitment of Bax and Bak , and release of cytochrome c and other pro - apoptotic proteins into the cytosol . The next three big questions to be answered are prob - ably the following : ( 1 . ) What exactly is the structure and the topology of the VacA complexes in the membranes ? ( 2 . ) What is the mechanism of the transfer of VacA from the endosomes to the mitochondria ? ( 3 . ) What is the mechanism that links the formation of the ion chan - nel in the mitochondrial inner membrane to the activa - tion of Bax and Bak and to the release of pro - apoptotic factors ? Perhaps it will again take 10 years to answer these questions . However , answers to these questions would not only clarify a central mechanism of H . pylori - induced gastro - duodenal diseases , they should also help to understand the mechanisms of apoptosis in general .
