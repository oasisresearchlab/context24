To understand how 27 this CLC diversity influences neuronal clathrin function , we characterised the biophysical 28 properties of clathrin comprising individual CLC variants for correlation with neuronal 29 phenotypes of mice lacking either CLC - encoding gene . CLC splice variants differentially 30 influenced clathrin knee conformation within assemblies , and clathrin with neuronal CLC 31 mixtures was more efficient in membrane budding than clathrin with single neuronal isoforms 32 nCLCa or nCLCb . Correspondingly , electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons 33 from mice lacking nCLCa or nCLCb were both defective in synaptic vesicle replenishment . 34 Mice with only nCLCb had a reduced synaptic vesicle pool and impaired neurotransmission 35 compared to wild - type mice , while nCLCa - only mice had increased synaptic vesicle 36 numbers , restoring normal neurotransmission . These findings highlight functional differences 37 between the CLC isoforms and show that isoform mixing influences tissue - specific clathrin 38 function in neurons . 39 40 KEY WORDS 41 Clathrin , membrane traffic , coated vesicle formation , protein isoforms , neuronal synapse 42 43 3 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT 44 45 This study reveals that diversity of clathrin light chain ( CLC ) subunits alters clathrin 46 properties and demonstrates that the two neuronal CLC subunits work together for optimal 47 clathrin function in synaptic vesicle formation . Our findings establish a role for CLC diversity 48 in synaptic transmission and illustrate how CLC variability expands the complexity of clathrin 49 to serve tissue - specific functions . 50 51 4 INTRODUCTION 52 53 Clathrin mediates vesicle formation from the plasma membrane and endosomal 54 compartments ( 1 ) . Recruited by cargo - recognising adaptor proteins , triskelion - shaped 55 clathrin proteins assemble into polyhedral lattices to capture membrane - associated cargo 56 and promote membrane bending into clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . Through sequestration 57 of a variety of cargo , CCVs play fundamental roles in general cellular physiology including 58 regulation of nutrient uptake and signalling , as well as in tissue - specific membrane traffic 59 such as synaptic vesicle ( SV ) generation ( 2 ) . This range of clathrin functions has been 60 attributed to adaptor and accessory protein variation ( 3 ) . However , functional diversity is also 61 generated by variability of clathrin subunits . Vertebrates have two types of clathrin heavy 62 chains with distinct functions ( 4 ) . The major vertebrate clathrin is formed from clathrin heavy 63 chain CHC17 ( herein referred to as CHC ) associated with clathrin light chains ( CLCs ) , which 64 do not bind the minor CHC22 clathrin isoform . Vertebrate CLCs are encoded by two different 65 genes CLTA and CLTB ( in humans ) , producing CLCa and CLCb isoforms of about 60 % 66 sequence identity ( 5 , 6 ) . Their sequence differences were conserved throughout evolution , 67 after their encoding genes arose through duplication , suggesting the two isoforms can 68 mediate distinct functions ( 7 , 8 ) . Expression levels of the CLCa and CLCb isoforms are 69 tissue - specific ( 9 ) , and further variation is created by alternative gene splicing during 70 development ( 10 ) and in brain ( 5 , 6 ) . Here we address how CLC diversity affects the 71 biophysical properties of clathrin and how the resulting variation affects the specialised 72 function of clathrin in synaptic vesicle ( SV ) replenishment . 73 74 Limited functional differences between CLCa and CLCb have been observed in cell culture 75 with respect to clathrin dynamics ( 11 ) , during focal adhesion formation ( 12 ) and during 76 cancer cell migration ( 13 ) , with mechanisms attributed to possible isoform - specific 77 differences in CLC binding proteins and post - translational modification ( 14 ) . Loss of CLCs in 78 culture and in vivo affects CCV uptake of some , but not all cargo , possibly reflecting 79 5 variability in mechanical demand for packaging different cargo into CCVs ( 9 , 14 , 15 ) . The 80 capacity for biophysical differences in clathrin comprising different CLC isoforms and their 81 splicing variants to influence tissue - specific clathrin functions has not yet been considered . 82 CLC variability has potential to affect clathrin function as CLCs interact with key domains of 83 the clathrin triskelion that contribute to clathrin - mediated membrane bending . They bind the 84 trimerisation domain ( TxD ) of the triskelion vertex where the three component CHCs interact 85 ( 16 , 17 ) , and extend along the triskelion leg to the bend at the knee where CLCs regulate 86 conformation ( 18 ) . Like various other endocytic proteins ( 3 ) , CLCs undergo neuron - specific 87 splicing ( 19 ) , which introduces one exon in CLCb ( encoding 18 residues ) and two exons 88 ( encoding 30 residues ) in CLCa at equivalent positions near the CLC C - termini , resulting in 89 higher molecular weight forms nCLCb and nCLCa ( 5 , 6 ) , and suggests neuron - specific 90 functions for these variants . In vitro , CLCs are required for efficient clathrin - mediated 91 membrane vesiculation at low temperature ( 20 ) . Thus , CLCs could affect clathrin - mediated 92 membrane deformation directly through their influence on clathrin lattice properties ( 20 , 21 ) , 93 as well as indirectly through cellular interaction with proteins that influence the actin 94 cytoskeleton ( 22 - 25 ) . 95 96 SV replenishment by membrane traffic following neuronal degranulation is critical for 97 sustained neurotransmission . Endocytosis is required to regulated synaptic plasma 98 membrane surface area and to retrieve SV proteins ( 26 ) , and SVs are generated from the 99 plasma membrane and endosome - like compartments ( 27 ) . The essential sites of clathrin 100 function in these pathways are debated ( 2 , 28 ) , but dysfunction of clathrin - associated 101 endocytic proteins is associated with neurological defects observed in Parkinson’s disease 102 ( 29 ) , Alzheimer’s disease ( 3 ) and in numerous animal models in which such proteins have 103 been genetically deleted ( 30 - 35 ) . 104 105 Here , we assess how clathrin lattices formed with neuronal and non - neuronal CLC variants 106 could differentially affect function by correlating their in vitro biophysical properties with in 107 6 vivo neuronal phenotypes of mice lacking CLC - encoding genes . We found that CLC 108 composition significantly influenced clathrin lattice properties and their ability to form vesicles 109 from liposome membrane in vitro . CLC splice variation influenced assembly curvature by 110 regulating CHC knee conformation , resulting in decreased ability of individual neuronal splice 111 variants to deform membrane in vitro . This effect was ameliorated for lattices formed from a 112 mixture of neuronal CLC isoforms . Mice lacking either CLCa or CLCb isoforms showed 113 corresponding differences in SV replenishment and synaptic neurotransmission compared to 114 their wild - type ( WT ) littermates expressing both isoforms , and to each other . Collectively , 115 these functional differences between CLC isoforms observed in vitro and in vivo establish a 116 role for CLC diversity in regulating clathrin function in neurons . 117 118 7 RESULTS 119 120 CLC splice variants differentially influence lattice curvature via the triskelion knee 121 Within clathrin lattices , the knee bending angle determines whether a hexagon ( non - 122 curvature inducing ) or pentagon ( curvature - inducing ) is formed ( 36 ) . In addition , the 123 characteristic pucker at the triskelion vertex and the crossing angle of interacting CHC legs 124 can further modulate lattice curvature ( 37 , 38 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . This versatility of clathrin assemblies 125 allows clathrin to sequester cargo of various sizes as well as to form stable , flat assemblies 126 that serve as signalling hubs ( 3 , 39 ) . For each closed cage , there is a fixed number of 12 127 pentagons , but a varying number of hexagons ( 40 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . Thus , larger cages ( i . e . lattices 128 of lower curvature ) have a smaller pentagon to hexagon ratio . CLCs maintain the puckered 129 conformation of triskelia in flat assemblies ( 20 ) and structural studies showed that nCLCb 130 can influence conformation of the triskelion knee up to a degree that inhibits assembly ( 18 ) . 131 Considering these effects on CHCs , we hypothesized that sequence differences between the 132 CLC isoforms and alterations due to splicing might modulate CLC influence on triskelion 133 conformation and lattice curvature . 134 135 To address this , we produced clathrin triskelia of defined CLC composition by reconstituting 136 tissue - derived CHC triskelia with recombinantly expressed CLCa , CLCb , nCLCa or nCLCb 137 ( Fig . S1a - d ) ( 41 ) . We then induced assembly of these different clathrins into closed cages 138 and analysed their diameters as a measure of lattice curvature by electron microscopy . 139 Previous studies showed that tissue - derived , CLC - bound clathrin ( native ) forms two major 140 size classes , while CHC - only triskelia predominantly form small - sized cages ( 42 - 45 ) . Our 141 results confirmed that without CLCs , CHC formed predominantly cages of less than 90 nm in 142 diameter with an average size of around 70 nm , representing cages of up to 60 triskelia ( 44 ) . 143 Clathrin with each of the CLC variants was further able to form larger cages with an average 144 diameter of around 110 nm ( 140 triskelia ) for those cages . The degree to which larger cages 145 8 were formed varied significantly between splice variants ( Fig . 1b , c ) , indicating that the 146 neuronal splice inserts regulate the influence of CLCs on lattice curvature . 147 148 To establish whether differences in larger cage formation resulted from CLC influence on the 149 triskelion vertex or on the CHC knee conformation or both , we dissected the effect of CLCs 150 separately for each domain . To test whether CLC diversity exerts influence through varying 151 CHC knee conformation , we produced clathrin cages from two CHC fragments that together 152 constitute a full - length clathrin triskelion “cut” at the knee ( Fig . 1d ) ( 46 ) . The Hub fragment 153 ( residues 1074 - 1675 ) was reconstituted with different CLCs ( 47 ) and combined with the 154 terminal - distal leg segment ( TDD , residues 1 - 1074 , Fig . S1e ) under conditions promoting 155 their co - assembly ( 46 ) . Cages produced when TDD was combined with CLC - reconstituted 156 Hub fragments were similar in size to fragment cages without CLCs , and the larger cages 157 observed for CLC variants associated with intact CHC did not form ( Fig . 1d , e ) . This result 158 demonstrates that for CLC diversity to exert an effect on lattice curvature , the CHC knee 159 must be intact , and shows that CLC splice variants differ in their influence on CHC knee 160 conformation . Formation of larger cages by neuronal CLCs suggests that the neuronal splice 161 inserts reduce the likelihood of knee conformation favouring pentagon formation and support 162 hexagon formation . To establish whether cage size differences also correlated with CLC 163 effects at the TxD , the different CLCs were compared for their ability to stabilise the TxD ( Fig . 164 S2 ) in an assay that measures triskelion dissociation . While dissociation differences were 165 observed between triskelia reconstituted with the different CLC isoforms and their splice 166 variants , these effects did not correlate with cage size differences , suggesting that CLC 167 influence at the vertex is not a major factor in lattice curvature . 168 169 CLC diversity modulates mechanical properties of the clathrin lattice 170 We next investigated whether the influence of CLCs on the CHC knee had mechanical 171 consequences for their ability to support membrane deformation . Mechanical properties of 172 clathrin lattices were previously shown to be CLC - dependent and reduced ability of CLC - free 173 9 clathrin to bend membranes in vitro was correlated with poorer planar lattice quality ( 20 ) . To 174 establish whether CLC diversity influences lattice quality , clathrins with different CLC 175 composition were assembled on electron microscopy ( EM ) grids coated with a clathrin - 176 binding fragment of epsin1 ( H 6 - ΔENTH - epsin 144 - 575 , Fig . S1f ) ( 48 ) . The flat lattices formed 177 were visualized by EM and their periodicity ( quality ) assessed by Fourier transform analysis . 178 Lattice quality was significantly reduced for clathrin with the neuronal splice variants of either 179 CLCa or CLCb compared to clathrin reconstituted with their respective non - neuronal variants 180 ( Fig . 2a , b ) . While lattice quality was not significantly different between clathrin with nCLCa or 181 nCLCb , nCLCb clathrin showed a tendency to form lattices of poorer quality ( Fig . 2c ) and 182 lattice quality was significantly improved if formed from a 1 : 1 mix of nCLCa clathrin and 183 nCLCb clathrin ( Fig . 2b ) . To visualise the nature of CLC distribution in these mixtures , 184 lattices were generated using His - tagged nCLCa clathrin or nCLCb clathrin combined with 185 the cognate untagged CLC and labelled with Ni - NTA - gold ( Figure S3 ) , confirming a uniform 186 distribution of each neuronal CLC within the mixed lattice . In contrast to the behaviour of the 187 neuronal CLCs , lattice quality was reduced in mixtures of CLCa clathrin and CLCb clathrin 188 compared to lattices formed by clathrin with only CLCa or CLCb . Notably , the lattice quality 189 resulting from neuronal and non - neuronal CLC compositions correlated with their influence 190 on cage size ( Table 1 ) , and suggests potential differential influence on membrane budding . 191 192 To determine whether CLC - related variation in lattice quality affects membrane bending , as 193 seen for complete absence of CLCs , we tested the function of the CLC - reconstituted 194 clathrins using a low temperature in vitro budding assay ( 20 ) . In this assay , H 6 - ΔENTH - 195 epsin 144 - 575 , coupled to liposomes via modified Ni - NTA lipids , captures clathrin at the 196 liposome surface . Lattice assembly on these liposomes generates buds , which remain 197 attached to the liposome due to lack of dynamin , needed for scission ( 20 , 48 ) . The efficiency 198 of clathrin with different CLC composition to form coated buds was assessed at 15°C , a 199 temperature permissive for budding by native clathrin but reduced for CLC - free clathrin ( 20 ) . 200 For each clathrin , we measured the diameter of clathrin - coated membrane profiles in thin - 201 10 section electron micrographs and assessed budding efficiency by the percentage of clathrin - 202 coated buds ( defined by a fitted diameter < 200 nm ) compared to all clathrin - coated 203 membrane profiles analysed ( Fig . 3a ) . In line with previous findings , we found that at 15°C 204 native clathrin was about twice as efficient in membrane deformation as CLC - free clathrin 205 ( 20 ) , and that budding efficiencies varied with the CLC composition of clathrin tested ( Fig . 206 3b ) . CLCa or CLCb clathrin lattices vesiculated membrane more efficiently than either 207 neuronal clathrin variant ( Fig . 3b ) , demonstrating that CLC splicing affects budding efficiency . 208 We found no statistically significant differences between CLCa and CLCb isoforms of the 209 neuronal or non - neuronal splice variants over the whole data set , yet differences within each 210 experiment indicate that in budding , clathrin with CLCb may be slightly more efficient than 211 CLCa clathrin , and nCLCb clathrin potentially less efficient than nCLCa clathrin ( Fig . 3c ) . 212 Visualising the clathrin - coated liposomes absorbed to EM grids confirmed that all clathrins 213 tested assembled into intact lattices or buds on the liposome surface ( Fig . S4 ) , suggesting 214 that the observed variation in budding efficiency was not due to impaired lattice formation , 215 but CLC - dependent lattice properties . Notably , mixing reconstituted neuronal clathrins 216 significantly improved budding efficiency ( Fig . 3d ) , overall reflecting the same pattern as 217 observed for both lattice quality and curvature ( Table 1 ) , suggesting all three parameters 218 result from differential CLC effects at the triskelion knee . Furthermore , all three assays 219 demonstrated that neuronal clathrin benefits from cooperative co - assembly of clathrin with 220 both isoforms . 221 222 Membrane deformation could result either from lattice formation at constant curvature or 223 through transitioning from flat to curved lattices ( Fig . 3e ) . To determine how budding was 224 generated in our in vitro system and how it was influenced by CLCs , we measured the angle 225 between the convex side of the coat and the coat - free membrane ( Fig . 3e ) , coat curvature 226 ( i . e . diameter of the clathrin - coated structure ) , coat length and neck width for all coated 227 membrane profiles ( 49 ) and then correlated these measurements . We observed a variety of 228 coat curvatures in our system ( Fig . 3f ) and found that while neck width decreased with 229 11 budding angle , as would be expected for both modes of deformation , coat curvature and 230 neck width correlated with the budding angle of the coated to the coat - free membrane ( Fig 231 3g , i ) . This indicates that lattices transition from flat to curved in our system , rather than 232 assembling with constant curvature , which would be independent of budding angle ( Fig . 3e ) . 233 In further support of this , we found no correlation between coat length and budding angle 234 ( Fig . 3h ) . Thus , we conclude that in our in vitro system , clathrin initially assembles into flat 235 lattices on the liposome membrane and then gradually deforms the underlying membrane 236 into coated buds , as observed by others in human SK - MEL - 2 cells ( 49 , 50 ) . Our results 237 suggest that CLC - mediated regulation is required for the transition of flat to curved lattices 238 and that CLC variants differ in their ability to promote this transition . Thus , collectively from 239 these in vitro studies , we conclude that CLC variants differentially regulate triskelion knee 240 conformation within the lattice , affecting the mechanical ability to deform membrane into 241 coated buds through varying the probability of pentagon formation via influence on the CHC 242 knee . In particular , single neuronal splice variants were less functional in these properties 243 and lattice quality compared to their non - neuronal splice variants , while a mixture of neuronal 244 variants appeared to improve their functionality to non - neuronal levels . 245 246 CLC composition affects SV pool size and replenishment 247 Our in vitro experiments indicate that clathrin lattices formed from a mixture of clathrin with 248 each neuronal CLC isoform efficiently support membrane deformation , while clathrin 249 comprising only one neuronal CLC isoform is attenuated for membrane budding . Therefore , 250 we predicted that neurons of animals with only one CLC isoform might be defective in 251 clathrin - mediated pathways that rely on SV formation . This hypothesis was investigated in 252 knock - out ( KO ) mice lacking the Clta or Cltb genes in all tissues ( CLCa KO and CLCb KO 253 mice ) . We previously generated CLCa KO mice ( 9 ) and have now produced CLCb KO mice . 254 Loss of Cltb in CLCb KO mice was confirmed by PCR , and no CLCb or nCLCb protein was 255 detected in all tissues analysed ( Fig . S5 ) . Whereas wild - type ( WT ) mice express a mixture of 256 CLCs in most tissues ( 9 ) , CLCa KO mice express only CLCb or nCLCb , and CLCb KO mice 257 12 express only CLCa or nCLCa , enabling functional analysis of clathrin with only one type of 258 CLC in neurons ( Fig . 4a ) . 259 260 Hippocampal neurons have frequently been used to study the function of endocytic proteins 261 in synaptic transmission ( 27 , 30 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 51 ) . H & E staining of the hippocampus showed 262 no morphological abnormalities in either KO strain , indicating that absence of either CLC 263 isoform does not affect gross hippocampus development in the CLC KO mice ( Fig . S6 ) . We 264 therefore used this system to evaluate the function of mature excitatory synapses in the CA1 265 region of the adult hippocampus , a region of well - defined neuronal architecture and 266 neurophysiological circuitry , in the CLC KO and WT mice . For electrophysiological recordings 267 at Schaffer collateral ( SC ) - CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices , a stimulating 268 electrode was placed in the SC fibres of the CA3 region and responses were then recorded 269 in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer ( Fig . 4b ) . 270 271 To determine the role of CLC diversity in SV pool replenishment in vivo , we recorded the 272 responses to a prolonged high - frequency stimulus , which maximally depletes presynaptic 273 terminals of the readily releasable pool ( RRP ) of SVs ( 52 - 54 ) . Under these conditions , initial 274 responses would draw from the pre - existing SV pool , while sustained neurotransmission 275 would rely on the efficiency of SV pool replenishment ( 53 ) . Using this approach , we were 276 able to assess CLC - dependency for different stages of SV exo - and endocytosis from these 277 recordings . We found that the initial fusion rate of SVs in either KO strain was similar to that 278 of their WT littermates , indicating that correct packaging of fusion - mediating cargo was not 279 affected by changes in CLC composition ( Fig . 4c , d and Fig . S7 ) . Instead , both KO models 280 had a decreased SV recycling rate characteristic of a defect in acute SV pool replenishment 281 ( Fig . 4c , d ) . This finding correlated with our expectation from in vitro properties of 282 reconstituted clathrin isoforms that showed clathrin lattices with only one type of neuronal 283 CLC were different from mixed lattices in their assembly properties ( Table 1 ) . 284 285 13 Further calculations based on data obtained from sustained trains of action potentials 286 indicated that the RRP was larger in the CLCb KO mice but reduced in the CLCa KO mice 287 when compared to WT littermates ( Fig . 4c , d and Fig . S7 ) , revealing a phenotype that we did 288 not expect from our in vitro data . To establish whether indeed the SV formation was altered 289 in the CLC KO mice rather than the ability to mobilise SVs from other SV pools , we assessed 290 the ultrastructure of excitatory synapses in the CLC KO mice and their WT littermates ( Fig . 291 4e ) . Indeed , SV density was significantly reduced in hippocampal neurons in the CLCa KO 292 animals . In contrast , SV density in equivalent neurons of the CLCb KO mice was significantly 293 increased compared to their WT littermates ( Fig . 4f , j ) , in line with our RRP estimates from 294 electrophysiological recordings ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Other parameters such as individual SV size 295 ( Fig . 4g , k ) , postsynaptic density ( PSD ) length ( Fig . 4h , l ) and excitatory synapse density 296 ( Fig . 4i , m ) were similar between both KO strains and respective WT littermates . Together , 297 these data show that CLCs are required for efficient and sustained synaptic function and 298 suggest that loss of either CLC decreases acute SV replenishment by affecting immediate 299 formation , correlating with expectations from reduced in vitro budding efficiency , but that the 300 KO strains differ in their ability to generally maintain SV pools . Thus , CLC composition 301 influences SV density in excitatory neurons of the hippocampus and indicates differential 302 functions for nCLCa and nCLCb in SV generation , such that mice with only nCLCa can 303 sustain a compensatory pathway for SV generation and mice with only nCLCb cannot . 304 305 CLCa KO and CLCb KO mice have distinct neurological and behavioural defects 306 To further investigate the differential consequences of CLCa or CLCb KO for synapse 307 function , we conducted additional electrophysiological experiments to characterise synaptic 308 transmission in our KO animals . Analyses of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic current 309 ( EPSC ) responses to stimuli of increasing magnitude revealed decreased EPSC response 310 amplitude in the CLCa KO mice compared to WT littermates , suggesting impaired basal 311 synaptic transmission in the CLCa KO mice ( Fig . 5a ) . In contrast , the evoked EPSC 312 response amplitude in hippocampal slices from the CLCb KO mice was of similar or higher 313 14 magnitude than that of their WT littermates , suggesting that basal synaptic transmission was 314 intact and even enhanced ( Fig . 5b ) . These differences in synaptic connectivity between 315 hippocampal function in the two KO strains could arise from defects in presynaptic 316 neurotransmitter release correlating with differences in SV pool size in the KO animals 317 relative to their WT littermates ( Fig . 4 ) . 318 319 Further , we performed paired - pulse ratio ( PPR ) recordings experiments , an approach that 320 allows assessment of defects in neurotransmitter release ( 55 , 56 ) . In excitatory neurons such 321 as those analysed here , a second stimulus pulse ( P 2 ) fired in short succession after an initial 322 pulse ( P 1 ) results in a larger response than the first stimulus . This facilitation is dependent on 323 changes in the probability of neurotransmitter release . PPR is inversely correlated with 324 release probability , as lower initial release probability leaves more fusion - competent vesicles 325 remaining at the terminal which are then released after the second stimulus ( 55 , 56 ) . We 326 observed that , compared to WT littermates , the PPR was increased in CLCa KO mice , 327 consistent with a reduction in release probability ( Fig . 5c ) . In contrast , no differences in PPR 328 were observed in CLCb KO mice compared to WT littermates ( Fig . 5d ) . Thus , specific loss of 329 nCLCa impairs presynaptic function compromising neurotransmitter release at the SC - CA1 330 synapse . Collectively , our electrophysiological data supports the morphological data ( Fig . 4 ) , 331 indicating that neurons with only nCLCa clathrin can compensate for defective SV 332 regeneration by expanding their SV pool from another pathway , while neurons with only 333 nCLCb clathrin cannot compensate and show decimated SV pools from impaired 334 replenishment . 335 336 Ongoing breeding of the CLCa KO colony confirmed a 50 % survival rate compared to that 337 expected for homozygous CLCa KO mice ( 9 ) , whereas homozygous CLCb KO mice had no 338 survival defects ( Fig . 5e ) . Survival phenotypes similar to the CLCa KO animals have been 339 reported for other genetic deletions in endocytic pathways , which also displayed neuronal 340 phenotypes ( 30 ) in the hippocampus and other regions of the brain ( 32 ) . Thus , we assessed 341 15 performance in the rotarod test for neuro - motor coordination for both CLC KO mice ( 57 ) . 342 Compared to their WT littermates , surviving CLCa KO mice displayed defects in rotarod 343 balance , whereas CLCb KO mice did not ( Fig . 5f ) . Further assessment of sensorimotor 344 function revealed that CLCa KO mice exhibited defects in a grid - walking test , ( Fig . 5g ) , but 345 not in grip strength ( Fig . 5h ) , suggesting neurological rather than muscular dysfunction in the 346 CLCa KO animals , supporting the notion that loss of nCLCa is less tolerable than loss of 347 nCLCb . Together , the phenotypes of the KO animals indicate that neuronal CLC isoforms are 348 differentially able to support compensatory mechanisms for adjusting SV pools hippocampal 349 synapses with impaired acute SV replenishment , and suggest that clathrin with only nCLCa 350 is more functional than clathrin with only nCLCb , while a mix of both neuronal CLCs is 351 necessary for optimal clathrin function in neurons , in keeping with their synergistic 352 contribution to clathrin function in vitro . 353 354 16 DISCUSSION 355 356 To understand the consequences of CLC diversity for clathrin function , we characterised the 357 biophysical properties of in vitro assemblies formed from clathrin comprising single CLC 358 isoforms and correlated these properties with neuronal phenotypes observed in KO animals 359 expressing single CLC isoforms . We found that neuronal CLC splicing affects lattice 360 properties ( Fig . 1b and Fig . 2b ) by diversifying the CLC influence on the CHC knee to 361 regulate lattice curvature ( Fig . 1c , d ) and deform membrane ( Fig . 3b ) . In particular , CLC 362 splicing apparently influences clathrin’s ability to introduce pentagons in order to transition 363 from flat to curved lattices ( Fig . 1a and Fig . 3e - i ) . Our in vitro studies further suggest that 364 lattices formed from mixtures of clathrin with nCLCa and nCLCb have different assembly 365 properties and are more efficient in membrane budding compared to clathrin with only one 366 type of neuronal CLC ( Fig . 2b , 3d ) . Consistent with this observation , neurons from both 367 CLCa and CLCb KO mice showed defects in synaptic transmission that indicated acute 368 clathrin - dependent SV replenishment was impaired ( Fig . 4c , d ) . However , the CLCa KO mice 369 had reduced numbers of SVs in their hippocampal synapses , while the CLCb KO mice had 370 more SVs than their WT littermates ( Fig . 4f , j ) . Thus , although acute SV replenishment was 371 impaired in both KO strains , clathrin with only nCLCa ( in the CLCb KO mice ) was able to 372 support a compensatory pathway of SV formation , while clathrin with only nCLCb ( in the 373 CLCa KO ) was not ( Fig . 5a - d ) . These findings establish functional differences between CLC 374 isoforms in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate how resulting clathrin diversity is important for 375 clathrin function in neurons . 376 377 Neuronal splicing predominates for CLCb in neurons ( 58 ) , while neuronal CLCs are not 378 present in other brain cells such as glial or Schwann cells ( 19 ) , indicating that the CLC splice 379 variants segregate within brain cell types to fulfil distinct functions . Neuronal CLC splicing 380 had a significant influence on lattice curvature and budding efficiency , decreasing the 381 likelihood of forming pentagons ( Table 1 ) , which was attributable to effects on the CHC knee 382 17 domain ( Fig . 1d ) . Given that the inserted sequences are located near the TxD where the C - 383 termini of CLCs are bound ( arrowheads , Fig . 6a ) , we propose that the splice inserts affect 384 the conformation of the adjacent knee of a neighbouring triskelion , which is closer than the 385 knee of the triskelion to which the CLC is bound ( Fig . 6b ) . This intermolecular influence could 386 involve splice inserts at the C - terminus ( stars , Fig . 6b ) interacting with the neighbouring CHC 387 or with the N - terminal domain of a CLC bound to the neighbouring knee ( Ns , Fig . 6b ) . 388 Considering the average 40 % sequence differences between CLCa and CLCb isoforms and 389 their even greater variation at the N - terminus , inter - CLC interactions could vary depending 390 on which splice isoform interacts with which CLC isoform N - terminus , thereby influencing 391 overall lattice properties . This imputed interaction may be lost from clathrin with non - neuronal 392 CLCs , which would explain why mixing non - neuronal CLC isoforms does not affect in vitro 393 budding to the same extent as mixing neuronal CLC isoforms ( Fig . 3d ) . 394 395 Here , we characterise the properties of homo - and hetero - assemblies of clathrin comprising 396 single CLC isoforms . In brain , CLC isoforms are apparently randomly distributed on triskelia 397 ( 59 ) , in which case neuronal inserted sequences could still influence lattice curvature via 398 interactions with an adjacent triskelion knee . The presence of nCLCb would serve as an 399 attenuator of nCLCa - specific interactions and vice versa . Further , in cells where CLCb 400 expression is transiently increased ( 60 ) , newly synthesized triskelia would be generally 401 occupied by a single CLC isoform as clathrin subunit turnover is slow ( 61 ) . The resulting 402 homotypic clathrins would then participate mixed in lattices , as we have studied here . Thus , 403 neuronal CLC isoform expression ratios ( and / or local abundance within cells ) could tailor 404 clathrin lattice properties specifically to particular needs . 405 406 There are several pathways involved in SV recycling in neurons and the role of clathrin has 407 been widely debated , possibly because the contribution of each pathway to SV formation is 408 variable between organisms , types of neurons and stimulus ( 51 , 62 , 63 ) . SV recycling can 409 either be achieved by direct regeneration of SVs through clathrin - mediated endocytosis from 410 18 the plasma membrane at low - frequency stimulus , or through clathrin - independent 411 mechanisms , which predominantly mediate retrieval of SV components from the plasma 412 membrane under high stimulus ( 2 , 27 , 28 , 33 , 51 ) . Rapid clathrin - dependent trafficking of SV 413 proteins from the endosomal pathway then leads to re - sorting and formation of SVs at high - 414 frequency stimulus ( 2 ) , which can occur in a timeframe of 1 - 3 seconds after stimulation ( 27 ) . 415 In our analysis of neurotransmission , SV recycling defects were detected by 416 electrophysiology within three seconds at high stimulus ( 20 Hz for 3s ) , suggesting the 417 defects detected were due to impaired clathrin - mediated regeneration of SVs from 418 endosomes . These findings are consistent with previously observed roles for CLCs in 419 recycling from non - neuronal endosomal compartments ( 60 , 64 ) . 420 421 That an acute SV pool replenishment defect was shared by neurons in both CLC KO strains 422 fits with our in vitro biophysical data that demonstrate single neuronal CLCs are not as 423 efficient in membrane deformation as a mixture of clathrin with both neuronal CLCs ( Fig . 3d ) . 424 In response to this defect , we found that clathrin with only nCLCa generated an increased 425 steady - state SV pool in CLCb KO neurons , while clathrin with only nCLCb could not ( Fig . 426 6b ) . CLCa seems to have preferential connection with the actin cytoskeleton compared to 427 CLCb ( 12 , 24 ) , which might account for the ability of nCLCa clathrin to function on its own 428 without nCLCb and benefit from involvement of actin and its accessory molecules to 429 compensate for defects in acute SV pool replenishment . It is possible that in the ( normal ) 430 presence of nCLCb , the actin interactions of nCLCa may be “diluted down” , so that nCLCb 431 works as an attenuating balancing mechanism to control SV pools at steady state . The 432 presence of nCLCb would simultaneously create lattice properties for efficient CCV budding 433 during neurotransmission . In its absence , the acute replenishment pathway would decrease 434 in efficiency but loss of the nCLCb attenuation effect enables a compensatory pathway with 435 nCLCa only . Thus , the budding defect resulting from a change in biophysical properties of 436 clathrin is detectable only under acute demand , and when demand is less acute , there are 437 19 mechanisms by which nCLCa clathrin can generate SVs that are not supported by nCLCb 438 clathrin . 439 440 Considering the whole animal phenotypes , including the increased mortality rate for CLCa 441 but not CLCb KO animals , CLCa seems to be the more functional CLC , while CLCb functions 442 mainly in conjunction with CLCa . This is in line with the observation that CLC expression 443 ratios vary with tissue , and while lymphoid cells almost exclusively express CLCa , no tissue 444 has been found to express exclusively CLCb ( 9 , 61 ) . In addition , CLC isoform splicing 445 changes during cell differentiation , development ( 10 , 58 ) and ratios of CLCb relative to CLCa 446 are modulated in tumour progression ( 13 ) and cell migration ( 60 ) . These observations , in 447 combination with the in vitro and in vivo data reported here , support the concept that , in 448 addition to influencing accessory protein interaction , the conserved CLC isoform and splicing 449 differences characteristic of vertebrates facilitate tissue - specific clathrin functions by directly 450 modulating clathrin lattice properties . In particular , CLC diversity regulates clathrin budding 451 efficiency , a property that we show here affects SV formation under acute demand , and is 452 likely to influence other pathways that rely on rapid clathrin - mediated membrane traffic . 453 454 20 MATERIALS AND METHODS 455 456 Protein expression and purification 457 CLCs in pET28a were expressed with a thrombin - cleavable , N - terminal His - tag and purified 458 by standard nickel affinity chromatography and further polished by size exclusion 459 chromatography on a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) . His - tags of CLC 460 constructs were removed by thrombin cleavage . His - tagged epsin1 in pET32c and His - 461 tagged ΔENTH - epsin 144 - 575 in pQE32 were expressed and purified as previously described by 462 standard nickel affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 463 200 10 / 300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) ( 65 ) . 464 465 CCVs were purified from porcine brain as described previously ( 45 ) and clathrin triskelia 466 purified by tris - extraction and size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 Increase 467 10 / 300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) . To generate CHC - only triskelia , endogenous CLCs were 468 removed using NaSCN and separated from CHC by size exclusion chromatography ( 41 ) . 469 470 For reconstitution of clathrin of defined CLC composition , CHC in buffer C ( 50 mM Tris - HCl 471 pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , 2mM EDTA , 1mM DTT ) at 0 . 8 - 1 . 0 mg / ml was incubated with purified 472 CLCs at 0 . 7 – 1 . 0 mg / ml in in the same buffer or in 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 200 mM NaCl at 473 a 1 : 6 . 6 ratio ( w / w ) for 1 h on ice . 474 475 Electron microscopy 476 Freshly glow - discharged , homemade , carbon - coated formvar films on copper grids ( Agar 477 Scientific ) were used for all EM applications . All specimens were observed using a Tecnai 478 G2 ( FEI ) electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV . Images were obtained 479 using a SIS Morada digital camera and TIA software ( FEI ) . 480 21 Cage size and lattice curvature determination 481 Samples were dialysed in assembly - promoting buffer A ( 100 mM MES , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM 482 MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 ) . Assembled cages were adsorbed to EM grids by placing grids on 10 μl 483 droplets of samples at 0 . 2 mg / ml on Parafilm for 90 s . Excessive liquid was removed using 484 filter paper and grids washed twice by transferring them sequentially onto two 15 μl droplets 485 of buffer A . Samples were then stained with 2 % uranyl acetate in water for 1 min and air - 486 dried before subjected to EM analysis . Diameters of clathrin cages were measured from 487 electron micrographs using ImageJ software ( NIH ) . Distribution of diameters was averaged 488 from the size distribution of 200 cages from three independent sets of experiments . For 489 quantification of the proportion of the two cage populations , grouped into cages smaller or 490 larger than 90nm in diameter , the proportions of the area under the curve for each population 491 and experiment were averaged and tested for statistically significant differences between 492 reconstituted clathrin isoforms using Prism 6 ( GraphPad ) . 493 494 Lattice assembly and quality assessment 495 For incubation , EM grids were placed on 5 - 15 μl droplets on Parafilm at room temperature . 496 Grids were firstly incubated with 0 . 04 mg / ml tag - free epsin 1 or H 6 - ΔENTH - epsin 144 - 575 in 497 buffer G ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 125 mM potassium acetate , 5 mM magnesium acetate ) for 498 30 min . Unbound protein was removed by transferring grids to two droplets of buffer G before 499 incubating grids with clathrin at 0 . 05 mg / ml in buffer G containing 0 . 1 % BSA for 30 min . 500 Lattices were fixed with 3 % glutaraldehyde in buffer G for 15 min and stained with 2 % or 5 % 501 uranyl acetate in water for 1 min . Lattice regularity was assessed from electron micrographs 502 of similar quality and various focuses for each specimen as a measure of lattice quality ( 20 ) . 503 For this , 2D Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) was produced using ImageJ software ( NIH ) . The 504 height of the peak corresponding to the periodicity of the lattice ( at ~ 0 . 036 nm - 1 ) served as a 505 measure for lattice quality – the higher the peak , the higher the quality of the lattice . 5 - 12 506 images were analysed for each reconstituted clathrin isoform within each of three 507 independent sets of experiments . 508 22 In vitro budding assay 509 In vitro budding was performed as previously described ( 48 ) . In brief , H 6 - ΔENTH - epsin 144 - 575 510 were bound to liposomes made from brain polar lipid extracts containing 5 % DGS - Ni - NTA 511 lipids ( Avanti ) . H 6 - ΔENTH - epsin 144 - 575 - coated liposomes were then chilled to 15 ° C and mixed 512 with clathrin triskelia stock solutions at 15 ° C , incubated for 30 min at 15 ° C and then 513 transferred on ice . Samples were then fixed at 4 ° C overnight and processed for EM analysis . 514 Diameter , coat length , budding angle and neck width of clathrin - coated membrane profiles 515 were measured from electron micrographs using ImageJ ( NIH ) and data processed using 516 Prism ( GraphPad ) . Between 150 and 200 coat profiles , randomly sampled across four thin 517 sections , were analysed for each sample ( > 60 000 nm total coat length per experiment per 518 sample ) . The proportion of curved lattices , defined by a diameter of less than 200 nm , of all 519 lattice profiles examined , was used as a measure of budding efficiency . Results from 3 - 5 520 independent sets of experiments were tested for statistical significance . 521 522 Generation of CLC KO mice 523 The Cltb ko / ko mouse strain used for this research project was created from ES cell clone 524 19159A - F4 , generated by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Inc . , and obtained from the KOMP 525 Repository ( www . komp . org ) . Methods used to create the CLCb - null ES cell clone have 526 previously been published ( 66 ) . In brief , the complete coding region of the Cltb gene was 527 completely deleted by homologous recombination using a large BAC - based targeting vector . 528 Targeted ES cells were then injected into albino C57BL / 6J - N blastocytes and transferred into 529 foster mothers . Chimeric offspring were mated with C57BL / 6J females ( Charles River ) , and 530 germ - line transmission of the Cltb - null allele ( Cltb ko ) was established . Heterozygote Cltb ko / + 531 mice were backcrossed on the C57BL / 6 background and bred to produce Cltb ko / ko 532 homozygous mice . CLCa KO mice were derived from C57BL / 6 WT mice ( 9 ) . 533 534 23 Analysis of protein expression in brain 535 Mouse brains were harvested from six 9 - 12 - month old C57BL / 6 WT and homozygous CLCa 536 and CLCb KO mice and quickly snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until 537 further use . Tissue were quickly thawed and homogenised in lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES 538 pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton - X 100 , 5 mM EDTA , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM PMSF , cOmplete ™ 539 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail mix ( Roche ) ) . The homogenate was further incubated on ice for 540 45 min before centrifugation at 21 000 g and 4°C for 2 x 10 min in an Eppendorf 5424 R 541 benchtop centrifuge ( Eppendorf ) . Protein content of the lysate was determined by BCA assay 542 ( Thermo Fisher ) . For analysis , 25 μg of sample were loaded on 4 - 15 % acrylamide gels ( Bio - 543 Rad ) and subjected to SDS - PAGE and western blotting . Primary antibodies used for 544 immunoblotting were T . D1 ( anti - CHC , made in - house ) , X16 ( anti - CLCa , made in - house ) , 545 CLTB ( anti - CLCb , Proteintech ) and anti - beta - actin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . 546 547 Electrophysiology 548 Experiments were performed in 8 - 10 - month - old mice . Both male and female mice were used 549 for electrophysiological experiments . Acute transverse hippocampal slices ( 300µm ) of 550 homozygous CLCa or CLCb KO and control mice were cut on a Leica VT - 1000 vibratome in 551 ice - cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) bubbled with 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 containing ( in 552 mM ) : NaCl ( 125 ) , KCl ( 2 . 4 ) , NaHCO 3 ( 26 ) , NaH 2 PO 4 ( 1 . 4 ) , D - ( + ) - Glucose ( 20 ) , CaCl 2 ( 0 . 5 ) 553 and MgCl 2 ( 3 ) . At 5 - minute intervals , slices were then transferred into a series of 3 different 554 chambers oxygenated ( 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 ) in the same base ACSF but with the following 555 temperature and component ( in mM ) variations : 1 . 21°C initially with MgCl 2 ( 1 ) and CaCl 2 556 ( 0 . 5 ) then allowed to heat gradually to 36°C ; 2 . 36°C with MgCl 2 ( 1 ) and CaCl 2 ( 1 ) ; and 3 . 557 36°C initially with MgCl 2 ( 1 ) and CaCl 2 ( 2 ) before cooling to 21°C . Slices were then left for at 558 least 1 hr before recordings commenced . 559 560 Evoked recordings were performed on an upright microscope continually perfused with 561 oxygenated recording solution at room temperature containing the same ACSF composition 562 24 as the third chamber and supplemented with 10 μM bicuculline . Pyramidal cells in the CA1 563 region were held at - 60mV in whole - cell voltage - clamp configuration using glass 564 microelectrodes ( resistance 3 - 8 MΩ ) filled with caesium gluconate intracellular solution 565 containing ( in mM ) : D - gluconic acid lactone ( 130 ) , HEPES ( 10 ) , EGTA ( 10 ) , NaCl ( 10 ) , CaCl 2 566 ( 0 . 5 ) , MgCl 2 ( 1 ) , ATP ( 1 ) and GTP ( 0 . 5 ) , QX314 ( 5 ) , pH to 7 . 2 with CsOH . To evoke 567 postsynaptic EPSCs , a bipolar concentric stimulation electrode ( FHC ) was placed in the SC 568 fibres of the CA3 region . For input - output recordings , the stimulus pulse was varied between 569 0 . 2 and 1mA with a pulse width of 0 . 1 ms and stimuli were delivered at a rate of 0 . 1 Hz . 570 Paired pulse stimuli were given at rate of 0 . 2 Hz with different inter - stimulus intervals , 571 ranging from 50 ms to 200 ms and a stimulation strength set to approximately 50 % of the 572 maximal response for each cell . PPR was calculated as the ratio of the peak amplitude of the 573 second response over the first response . Calculation of RRP size , initial fusion efficiency and 574 SV recycling rate was done on ESPC recordings that underwent 3 s duration trains of 575 stimulation at 20Hz and estimated as previously described ( 53 , 67 ) . Briefly , RRP , fusion 576 efficiency ( fe ) and vesicle recycling rate ( α ) were evaluated from the cumulative charge 577 during the stimulation train using the following two equations : 578 579 Equation 1 : 580 581 582 Equation 2 : 583 584 r ( 1 ) is the charge of the first EPSC in the train 585 r ( i ) the charge passed by the i th EPSC 586 r ( ∞ ) was calculated from the average charge of the last 10 EPSCs in the train 587 Δ t is the stimulus interval in the train 588 The RRP was estimated as RRP = r ( 1 ) / fe . 589 590 25 All currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier , filtered ( 1 kHz ) and digitised 591 ( 10 kHz ) . Data were monitored online and analysed offline using WinEDR and WinWCP 592 software ( available free online at http : / / spider . science . strath . ac . uk / sipbs / software _ ses . htm ) . 593 Stimulus artefacts in representative traces were digitally removed for clarity . 594 595 Electron microscopy of synapse ultrastructure 596 Experiments were performed in 4 - 12 - month - old mice . Female mice were used for 597 ultrastructural experiments . Brain hemispheres were collected from homozygous KO mice 598 and WT littermates and cut in sagittal orientation . Slices were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde 599 and 1 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and stained sequentially with 1 . 5 % potassium ferricyanide and 1 % 600 OsO 4 , 1 % thiocarbohydrazide , 2 % OsO4 , 1 % uranyl acetate , 0 . 66 % lead nitrate in aspartic 601 acid . Samples were then gradually dehydrated and embedded for electron microscopy . The 602 ultrastructure of excitatory synapses in four electron micrographs of the VI lobule of the 603 cerebellum or CA1 hippocampus perinuclear region per genotype were analysed for the 604 ultrastructure of excitatory synapses using ImageJ ( NIH ) and Prism 6 ( GraphPad ) software 605 ( n = 3 ) . To determine SV density , SVs in 300 nm vicinity to the centre of the PSD in each 606 synapse were counted . 607 608 Mouse behavioural tests 609 All experiments were performed in accordance with the Animals Scientific procedures Act UK 610 ( 1986 ) . Heterozygous Cltb ko / + mice were crossed to obtain homozygous Cltb ko / ko mice and 611 WT littermates . Heterozygous Clta ko / + mice were crossed to obtain homozygous Clta ko / ko mice 612 and WT littermates . Experiments were performed in 2 - 8 - month - old mice . Male mice only 613 were used for all behavioural experiments . 614 615 Rotarod latency ( Accelerating Rotarod ; Ugo - Basile 7650 model ) was used to assess motor 616 coordination . Mice were placed on the Rotarod , which was slowly accelerated from 3 to 30 617 26 rounds per minute over 5 minutes . Mice were given 3 trials per day for 2 days with at least 10 618 min inter - trial intervals . Time to fall from the rotarod ( latency ) was recorded for each trial . 619 Mice that remained on the Rotarod for the whole 5 min trial were assigned a 300 second 620 latency . 621 622 Grip strength ( grip strength meter ; Columbus Instruments ) was used to measure muscle 623 strength in the forepaws . The grip strength meter was positioned horizontally , and mice were 624 held by the tail and allowed to grasp the metal pull - bar . The animals were then pulled back 625 and the force applied to the bar and the moment the grasp was released was recorded . Mice 626 were given 5 trials with 1 min inter - trial intervals and were tested on 2 days . The mean of 627 results from 10 trials was assigned for the grip strength of each animal . 628 629 Grid - walking was used to assess spontaneous motor deficits and limb movements involved 630 in precise stepping , coordination , and accurate paw placement . Adult mice were required to 631 navigate over a wire mesh grid . After each trial , 70 % ethanol was used to clean the 632 apparatus . Mice were given 3 trials with 1 min inter - trial intervals and were tested on 2 days . 633 Behaviour on the grid was recorded on camera and was analysed later by an experimenter 634 who was blind to the genotype . A foot - slip was scored when the paw completely missed a 635 rung and the limb fell between the rungs . Counts of foot - slips for right forelimb , left forelimb , 636 right hindlimb and left hindlimb were obtained . Total footsteps were also recorded . The mean 637 of results from 10 trials was used for each animal . 638 639 Statistical analysis 640 All experiments were performed at least three times . All calculations and graphs were 641 performed with ImageJ , Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism software . P - values were 642 calculated using two - tailed Student’s unpaired or paired ( in vitro budding ) t - tests , two - way 643 ANOVA with repeated measures ( electrophysiology ) , one - way ANOVA followed by Holm - 644 Sidak correction for multiple comparison or one - way ANOVA for preselected pairs without 645 27 correction for multiple comparison ( clathrin biophysical properties ) . Detailed statistical 646 information including statistical tests used , number of independent experiments , p values and 647 definition of error bars is listed in individual figure legends . 648 649 28 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 650 This work was supported by grants to F .

Interaction between a neuronal splicing insert and the knee of an adjacent triskelion 943 and / or adjacent CLC N - terminus ( N ) could promote conformational change in the CHC knee . 944 As the formation of pentagons and hexagons requires different knee angles , this interaction 945 could consequently influence lattice curvature ( see Fig . 1a ) . c In WT mice ( centre ) , a mix of 946 39 nCLCa and nCLCb clathrin creates the appropriate biophysical properties to mediate SV 947 generation from endosomal compartments ( and possibly the plasma membrane , blue - green 948 arrows ) . Loss of nCLCa ( left ) creates nCLCb clathrin lattices that are defective in efficient SV 949 regeneration ( blue arrows ) , resulting in decimated SV pools . Loss of nCLCb ( right ) creates 950 nCLCa clathrin lattices , which are also less efficient in SV regeneration than WT , but able 951 maintain an overall increased SV pool by excess budding to compensate for reduced acute 952 SV pool replenishment efficiency ( green arrows ) . 953 954 40 955 Figure 1 956 41 957 Figure 2 958 42 959 Figure 3 960 43 961 Figure 4 962 963 44 964 Figure 5 965 966 45 967 Figure 6 968
