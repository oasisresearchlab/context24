However , cytoskeleton - associated proteins that modify membrane dynamics may also regulate the formation of the HIV - mediated fusion pore and hence viral infection . Because the effects of HDAC6 - tubulin deacetylase on cortical (cid:1) - tubulin regulate cell migration and immune synapse organization , we explored the possible role of HDAC6 in HIV - 1 - envelope - mediated cell fusion and infection . The binding of the gp120 protein to CD4 (cid:2) - permissive cells increased the level of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin in a CD4 - dependent manner . Furthermore , overexpression of active HDAC6 inhibited the acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin , and remarkably , prevented HIV - 1 envelope - dependent cell fusion and infection without affecting the expression and codistribution of HIV - 1 receptors . In contrast , knockdown of HDAC6 expression or inhibition of its tubulin deacetylase activity strongly enhanced HIV - 1 infection and syncytia formation . These results demonstrate that HDAC6 plays a signiﬁcant role in regulating HIV - 1 infection and Env - mediated syncytia formation . INTRODUCTION Human immunodeﬁciency virus ( HIV ) infection is initiated by the virus binding to the cell surface after CD4 engage - ment and HIV - 1 fusion with the plasma membrane ( Stein et al . , 1987 ; Maddon et al . , 1988 ; McClure et al . , 1988 ; Moore et al . , 1997 ) . The main coreceptors for HIV - 1 infection have been shown to be CXCR4 and CCR5 , which represented a major advance in understanding the mechanism of the HIV - 1 infection ( Cocchi et al . , 1995 ; Alkhatib et al . , 1996 ; Bleul et al . , 1996 ; Choe et al . , 1996 ; Deng et al . , 1996 ; Doranz et al . , 1996 ; Dragic et al . , 1996 ; Feng et al . , 1996 ) . As a result , it has been proposed that the sequential binding of gp120 viral protein to CD4 and to one coreceptor induces speciﬁc conformational changes in gp41 , facilitating viral fusion with cell membrane ( Clapham and McKnight , 2002 ) . The cell cytoskeleton is involved in the early events of viral infection , regulating viral penetration and genome un - coating , the movement of viral capsids , and integration of the viral genome . Accordingly , actin and microtubules are required for the efﬁcient entry of herpes simplex type 1 and simian virus 40 , respectively ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Marozin et al . , 2004 ) . It has been shown that disrupting the actin network can inhibit infection of HIV - 1 and fusion with the host cell ( Iyengar et al . , 1998 ; Jernigan et al . , 2000 ) , presum - ably by disrupting the colocalization of CD4 and CXCR4 ( Iyengar et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , the actin cytoskeleton seems to be necessary for activation of the reverse transcrip - tion complex ( Bukrinskaya et al . , 1998 ) . However , little is known about the role of cytoskeleton - related enzymes in the control of HIV fusion and infection . Histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) is exclusively located in the cytoplasm , and it regulates the acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin ( Hubbert et al . , 2002 ; Matsuyama et al . , 2002 ; Haggarty et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . Acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin is involved in stabilizing microtubules ( MTs ) ( Piperno et al . , 1987 ) , and stable MTs are known to regulate actin - dependent rufﬂe formation at the plasma membrane and cell motility through the activation of Rac - 1 or Rho ( Kaverina et al . , 1999 ; Water - man - Storer and Salmon , 1999 ) . Moreover , it has recently been shown that by acting on HDAC6 and mDia2 , Rho - GTPase can inﬂuence the levels of acetylated MTs and hence actin organization , thereby interfering with osteoclast mat - uration ( Destaing et al . , 2005 ) . Another substrate that can be deacetylated and inactivated by HDAC6 is the heat shock protein 90 , a chaperon that regulates structural maturation and the assembly of certain protein complexes ( Bali et al . , 2005 ; Kovacs et al . , 2005 ) . HDAC6 associates with MTs and colocalizes with the microtubule motor complex ( Smith et al . , 2000 ; Hubbert et al . , 2002 ; Matsuyama et al . , 2002 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , it is a cytoplasmic enzyme that promotes cell migration ( Hubbert et al . , 2002 ; Palazzo et al . , 2003 ; Saji et al . , 2005 ) and controls the membrane organization of CD3 and LFA - 1 , the translocation of the microtubule organizer center ( MTOC ) , and T - cell activation ( Serrador et al . , 2004 ) .

Thus , because HDAC6 is clearly an important regulator of membrane dynamics , we hypothesized that it might modu - late HIV - envelope ( Env ) - mediated cell fusion and infection . Here , we have studied the effect of inhibiting or of overex - pressing HDAC6 on the fusion activity of gp41 / gp120 and on the capacity of HIV - 1 to infect cells . Our data show that this cytoplasmic deacetylase exerts an important regulatory effect on these processes . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and Reagents The anti - CD4 HP2 / 6 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) ( mAb ; IgG1 ) that inhibits the gp120 / CD4 interaction has been described previously ( Carrera et al . , 1987 ) , and the anti - CD4 v4 - phycoerythrin ( PE ) mAb ( IgG1 ) , which does not react with the gp120 binding site , was obtained from BD Biosciences ( San Jose , CA ) . The PE - labeled anti - CXCR4 or - CCR5 mAb were from BD Biosciences , and the biotinylated mAbs against human CXCR4 and CCR5 were obtained from R & D ( Marina del Rey , CA ) . The sc - 5255 anti - HDAC6 polyclonal anti - serum was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) , and the anti - (cid:1) - tubulin B - 5 - 1 - 2 , anti - acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin 6 - 11B - 1 , and anti - vimentin mAbs were from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . Trichostatin A ( TSA ) and sodium butyrate ( NaBut ) were supplied by Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA ) , whereas stro - mal cell - derived factor - 1 (cid:1) ( SDF - 1 (cid:1) ) and regulated on activation normal T - cell expressed and secreted were obtained from R & D . The ﬂuorescent cell tracers Calcein - AM , CMTMR , and CMAC were from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) . Cells The human T - cell Jurkat J77 and MT - 2 lines and the Jurkat cell line expressing HIV - 1 - Env - Hxbc2 ( Jurkat Hxbc2 ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium sup - plemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) . HeLa P5 cells , stably transfected with human CD4 and CCR5 cDNA and with an HIV - LTR - driven (cid:2) - galacto - sidase ( (cid:2) - Gal ) reporter gene ( Pleskoff et al . , 1997 ) , were provided by Dr . M . Alizon ( Hoˆpital Cochin , Paris , France ) as well as the HeLa P4 cells stably transfected with human CD4 . HeLa 243 and HeLa ADA cells coexpressing the Tat and HIV - 1 - Env proteins were also provided by Dr . M . Alizon ( Schwartz et al . , 1994 ; Pleskoff et al . , 1997 ) . Human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) were isolated from healthy donors using Ficoll - Hypaque density gradient centrifugation ( GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom ) . The PBLs were activated over 3 d with 1 (cid:3) g / ml phytohemagglu - tinin ( Murex Diagnostics , Norcross , GA ) and then cultured with interleukin - 2 ( 6 U / ml ) . HDAC6 Recombinant DNA Constructs and Lipotransfection The wild - type ( wt ) - HDAC6 - GFP and the dead mutant ( dm ) - HDAC6 - GFP harboring a double point mutation ( H216A / H611A ) that causes deacetylase inactivation have been described previously ( Grozinger et al . , 1999 ; Serrador et al . , 2004 ) . These two expression vectors were transfected in HeLa P4 or P5 cells using Megafectin - 20 ( Qbiogene , Carlsbad , CA ) . Brieﬂy , HeLa P4 or P5 cells were seeded in 75 - cm 2 ﬂasks at a density that would reach 50 – 80 % conﬂuence 24 h later . Then , HeLa cells were lipotransfected with Megafec - tin - 20 liposomes bearing wt - HDAC6 - GFP , dm - HDAC6 - GFP , or green ﬂuo - rescent protein ( GFP ) cDNA constructs ( 5 (cid:3) g of cDNA / ﬂask ) for 4 h at 37°C in DMEM containing 3 % FCS but without antibiotics . The HeLa cells were then trypsinized and cultured in fresh DMEM for 24 h ( 10 % FCS and 1 % antibiotics ) , and GFP expression was monitored by ﬂuorescence . The HeLa P4 or P5 cells were assayed in Env - mediated cell fusion or HIV - 1 infection experiments 24 h after Megafectin - 20 transfection . In parallel , CD4 , CXCR4 , and CCR5 cell surface expression was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry . HDAC6 Retroviral Transduction of T - Cells MT - 2 and Jurkat J77 T - cells expressing GFP , wt - , or dm - HDAC6 - GFP were obtained by infection with a replication deﬁcient Moloney murine leukemia virus . Brieﬂy , GFP , wt - HDAC6 - GFP , and dm - HDAC6 - GFP constructs were cloned in the bicistronic pLZR - IRES / GHR vector ( kindly provided by Dr . Antonio Bernad , National Centre for Biotechnology , Madrid , Spain ) , and then retroviral production and cellular transduction were performed as described previously ( Abad et al . , 2002 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence and Flow Cytometry HeLa or T - cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized for 3 min in 2 % formaldehyde , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and immunostained for acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin , (cid:1) - tubulin , or HDAC6 as described previously ( Piperno et al . , 1987 ; Serrador et al . , 2004 ) . The cells were visualized using a Leica DMR photomicroscope and a Leica TCS - SP confocal microscope ( Leica , Heidelberg , Germany ) . To assess the expression of the HIV - 1 receptors ( CD4 , CXCR4 , or CCR5 ) , T - and HeLa cells that were untransfected or that were transfected with GFP and wt - HDAC6 or the dm - HDAC6 - GFP were stained for CXCR4 or CCR5 using speciﬁc biotinylated mAbs that were visualized with allophycocyanin - labeled streptavidin . CD4 was recognized with a PE - labeled mAb against CD4 . For drug treatments , untreated , TSA - or NaBut - treated cells were stained for CXCR4 , CCR5 , or CD4 using PE or ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate - labeled mAbs . The cells were then analyzed in a FACScalibur ﬂow cytometer ( BD Bio - sciences , San Diego , CA ) . Irrelevant isotype - matched mAbs were used as controls . Western Blot Analysis of (cid:1) - Tubulin Acetylation To study gp120 - induced (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation , either untransfected or MT - 2 cells transfected with wt - or dm - HDAC6 - GFP were incubated with recombi - nant soluble gp120 IIIB protein ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml / 1 (cid:1) 10 6 cells ) for the time periods indicated . The cells were resuspended in 60 (cid:3) l of MES buffer [ 10 mM 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid at pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , and 5 mM MgCl 2 ] containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) , sonicated twice for 30 s at 4°C , and boiled in sample buffer containing 5 % (cid:2) - mercapto - ethanol for 1 min at 100°C . Cell lysates were immunoblotted and probed for (cid:1) - tubulin and acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin as de - scribed previously ( Serrador et al . , 2004 ) . After treatment with TSA or NaBut , cells were resuspended in 60 (cid:3) l of MES buffer , and protein samples were prepared as described above . Cell lysates were immunoblotted for HDAC6 , (cid:1) - tubulin , acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin , and vimentin as described in Serrador et al . , 2004 . The protein bands were visualized and analyzed using the LAS - 1000 charge - coupled device system and Image Gauge 3 . 4 software ( Fuji Photo Film , Tokyo , Japan ) . The increase in (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation was quantiﬁed and expressed as the ratio of the intensities of the acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin and the total (cid:1) - tubulin bands ( Actub / tub ) . HDAC6 Knockdown Three 20 - nucleotide double - stranded short interference RNAs ( siRNAs ) were generated against the HDAC6 sequence spanning nucleotides 193 – 213 , 217 – 237 , and 284 – 304 ( Eurogentec , Hampshire , United Kingdom ) as described previously ( Serrador et al . , 2004 ) . HeLa P4 or P5 cells were transfected with the siRNAs at a ﬁnal concentration of 200 nM using Oligofectamine ( Invitro - gen ) . Mock transfection with a scrambled irrelevant double - stranded siRNA ( Eurogentec ) served as a negative control of mRNA interference . Cells were transfected twice over 3 d and collected 24 h later . To analyze HDAC6 silencing , whole cell lysates ( 40 (cid:3) g ) of transfected cells were analyzed by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody anti - HDAC6 and mAbs against acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin and (cid:1) - tubulin . HDAC6 - silenced cells were used in Env - mediated cell fusion or HIV - 1 infection experiments as described below . HIV - 1 - Env - mediated Cell – Cell Fusion A (cid:2) - galactosidase cell fusion assay was performed as described previously ( Valenzuela - Fernandez et al . , 2001 ) . Brieﬂy , HeLa 243 or HeLa ADA cells were mixed with untreated or treated HeLa P5 or P4 cells in 96 - well plates in a 1 : 1 ratio and incubated for 16 h . The fused cells were washed , lysed , and the enzymatic activity was evaluated by chemiluminescence ( (cid:2) - Gal reporter gene assay ; Roche Diagnostics ) . Syncytia formation was detected by ﬁxing cells with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and staining with the (cid:2) - galactosidase substrate X - Gal , as described previously ( Pleskoff et al . , 1997 ) . A dual ﬂuorescence cell fusion assay was also performed as described previously ( Valenzuela - Fernandez et al . , 2001 ) . Brieﬂy , CMTMR - loaded Env (cid:2) Jurkat - Hxbc2 cells were mixed with Calcein - AM - loaded parental or transfected J77 cells or with 2 - d PHA - activated PBLs . The double - labeled cells were detected 6 or 12 h later by ﬂow cytometry or ﬂuorescence microscopy . When indicated , the target T - cells ( CD4 (cid:2) / CXCR4 (cid:2) ) were preincubated with TSA or NaBut for 2 h at the concentrations indicated . The target cells were then washed extensively to remove the drugs before coculturing with Env - expressing cells . To assess the effects of Taxol or Nocodazole in Env - mediated fusion , these drugs were present throughout the experiment . Anti - CD4 mAb ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml for 30 min at 37°C ) was used as a control for the blockage of cell fusion . The extent of fusion was calculated as the percentage fusion (cid:3) ( number of bound cells positive for both dyes / number of bound cells positive for Calcein - labeled target cells ) (cid:1) 100 . Detection of (cid:1) - Tubulin Acetylation at Env (cid:2) Cell - to - Target Cell Contact Areas For the HeLa - based cell – cell fusion model , HeLa P5 and R5 - Env (cid:2) HeLa ADA cells were detached with PBS - EDTA ( 5 mM ) , washed , and cocultured on sterile glass coverslips at a 1 : 1 ratio in fresh DMEM for 3 h at 37°C . It is important to note that HeLa cells kept a spherical morphology during this short time in culture . After 3 h , the cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized for 3 min in 2 % formaldehyde , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS and immunostained for acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin as described above . For the T - cell - based fusion model , A . Valenzuela - Ferna´ndez et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 5446 Env (cid:2) - Hxbc2 cells were cocultured with J77 cells in suspension at a 1 : 1 ratio for 3 h at 37°C . The cells were then ﬁxed and permeabilized for 3 min in 2 % formaldehyde , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , and the acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin present was assessed by immunostaining as described above . In both cell - to - cell fusion models , accumulation of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin was monitored in indi - vidual target cells in contact with Env (cid:2) - formed syncytia . Cells were visual - ized using a Leica DMR photomicroscope and a Leica TCS - SP confocal microscope ( Leica ) . HIV - 1 Viral Preparation Highly infectious preparations of HIV - 1 NL4 . 3 and HIV - 1 BaL virus strains were generated by several consecutive passages of the original HIV - 1 isolates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ; see Valenzuela et al . , 1997 ) . Brieﬂy , PBMCs were infected with one synchronous dose of HIV - 1 NL4 . 3 or HIV - 1 BaL , andculturesupernatantswererecovered3dlaterandstoredat (cid:4) 70°C . Freshly thawed aliquots were ﬁltered through 0 . 22 - (cid:3) m ﬁlters before use . HIV - 1 Entry and Infection HIV - 1 NL4 . 3 entry and multiplicity of infection ( MOI , 1 ) was assayed in PHA - activated PBLs or MT - 2 T - cells over 90 min . When indicated , T - cells were pretreated with anti - CD4 mAbs ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml ) , SDF - 1 (cid:1) ( 300 nM ) , 3 (cid:5) - azido - 2 (cid:5) , 3 (cid:5) - dideoxythymidine ( AZT ) ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml ) , TSA ( dose response ) , or NaBut ( 500 (cid:3) M ) . HIV - 1 entry into parental or transfected MT - 2 cells was monitored 12 h after HIV - 1 infection by measuring proviral gag HIV - 1 DNA by PCR ( Zhao et al . , 2002 ) . HIV - 1 infection ( MOI , 0 . 1 ) of PHA - activated PBLs was assessed every 48 h by measuring the concentration of p24 in the culture supernatant by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( INNOTEST HIV - 1 antigen mAb ; Inno - genetic , Ghent , Belgium ) . HIV - 1 NL4 . 3 or HIV - 1 BaL infection ( MOI , 1 ) of HeLa P5 cells was performed in 96 - well plates for 5 h at 37°C before the cells were washed and cultured for 52 h . Finally , the cells were lysed , and the HIV - 1 infection was assessed by (cid:2) - galactosidase measurement . Where indicated , cells were pretreated with a mAb anti - CD4 before HIV - 1 infection . RESULTS HIV - 1 - Env - mediated (cid:1) - Tubulin Acetylation Is Abolished by HDAC6 Overexpression To study the possible role of HDAC6 in the control of HIV - 1 infection , we ﬁrst examined the capacity of the HIV - 1 - Env to induce the acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin . We found that gp120 IIIB , a X4 - tropic Env protein , triggered acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin both in permissive parental cells and in MT - 2 cells trans - fected with retroviral dm - HDAC6 . The maximal threefold increase observed was detected within 4 – 6 h of exposure ( Figure 1A , MT - 2 and dm - HDAC6 - MT - 2 , gp120 - III treated ) . Likewise , the gp120 SF2 protein also triggered acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin ( our unpublished data ) . In contrast , gp120 - medi - Figure 1 .

( A ) Kinetic analysis of gp120 - induced (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation in parental , dm - , and wt - HDAC6 - transfected MT - 2 cells ( gp120 - IIIB ) compared with untreated cells . Lys40 (cid:1) - tubulin acetyla - tion was quantiﬁed and presented in reference to the total (cid:1) - tubulin ( Actub / tub ) . ( B ) Involve - ment of CD4 in gp120 - mediated (cid:1) - tubulin acet - ylation . A neutralizing anti - CD4 mAb impairs gp120 - IIIB - mediated (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation , whereas the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 has no effect . Control lines indicate untreated and gp120 III - treated MT - 2 cells , respectively . To block CD4 or CXCR4 / gp120 III binding and sig - naling , MT - 2 cells were pretreated with mAb anti - CD4 ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml ) or AMD3100 ( 50 (cid:3) M ) dur - ing 30 min at 37°C , before gp120 III addition to the cells for 4 h at 37°C . ( C ) Redistribution of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin ( red ﬂuorescence , white arrowheads ) at cell – cell contact areas within the syncytia . Cells not in contact with the syn - cytia ( asterisks ) did not accumulate acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin . Black bars in differential interference contrast ( DIC ) images indicate 10 (cid:3) m . Data are representative of three independent experi - ments . HDAC6 Regulates HIV - 1 Infection Vol . 16 , November 2005 5447 ated (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation was not observed in MT - 2 cells that overexpressed HDAC6 ( Figure 1A , wt - HDAC6 - MT - 2 , gp120 - III treated ) . Untreated MT - 2 cells presented stable levels of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin ( Figure 1A ) . The wt - HDAC6 - MT - 2 cells contained (cid:6) 20 % of the acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin de - tected in MT - 2 cells ( Figures 1A and 2B ) and a normal cell surface expression of CD4 and CXCR4 was observed ( Figure 2D ) . Therefore , the deacetylase activity of HDAC6 seems to affect the capacity of gp120 to induce (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation . Soluble HIV - 1 gp120 protein can stimulate several signal - ing pathways due to the engagement of CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5 receptors ( reviewed in Perfettini et al . , 2005 ) . There - fore , it is conceivable that in MT - 2 CD4 (cid:2) / CXCR4 (cid:2) cells , gp120 IIIB - mediated (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation could occur through binding to either CD4 or CXCR4 . To ascertain the role played by CD4 or CXCR4 in gp120 - induced (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation , parental MT - 2 cells were pretreated with a neu - tralizing anti - CD4 mAb ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml ) or with the CXCR4 an - tagonist AMD3100 ( 50 (cid:3) M ) ( reviewed in De Clercq , 2003 ) for 30 min at 37°C before adding gp120 IIIB . The gp120 IIIB - in - duced (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation was only blocked by the neu - tralizing anti - CD4 mAb ( Figure 1B ) , indicating that gp120 IIIB - dependent (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation occurred through its interaction with CD4 . The localization of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin was assessed early in the process of HIV - 1 - Env - mediated cell fusion . Cocultures were established involving HeLa ADA ( R5 - tropic Env (cid:2) cells ) or J77 - Hxbc2 ( X4 - tropic Env (cid:2) cells ) with their respec - tive target cells ( CD4 (cid:2) / CXCR4 (cid:2) / CCR5 (cid:2) HeLa P5 or CD4 (cid:2) / CXCR4 (cid:2) J77 T - cells ) . After 3 h , acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin was mainly concentrated at cell – cell contacts formed be - tween individual target cells and the Env (cid:2) syncytia ( Figure 1C , arrowheads ) . Thus , in target cells that were not in con - tact with the Env (cid:2) cells acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin did not con - centrate at points of cell – cell contact ( Figure 1C , see asterisk - labeled cells in HeLa - based model of fusion ) . Furthermore , acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin did not accumulate at homotypic target cell – cell contacts , thereby indicating that the Env - CD4 inter - Figure 2 .

Acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin ( red ) was not readily detected in wt - HDAC6 - GFP MT - 2 cells ( arrowhead - labeled cells ) , whereas it was strongly visible in untreated or dm - HDAC6 - GFP - transfected cells and be - came reorganized during HIV - 1 infection .

( F ) Flow cytometry analysis of Env - mediated T - cell fusion after 6 h between pa - rental , wt - , or dm - HDAC6 - transfected J77 cells , and Hxbc2 - Env (cid:2) T - cells . When indi - cated , syncytia formation was blocked with an anti - CD4 mAb . The Western blot analysis of (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation levels in parental , GFP - , or wt - HDAC6 - transfected J77 cells is shown at the bottom . Values indicate (cid:1) - tubu - lin acetylation in relation to the total (cid:1) - tubu - lin ( Actub / tub ) . Data are representative of at least three independent experiments , and the values are means (cid:7) SEM ; n (cid:3) 3 . A . Valenzuela - Ferna´ndez et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 5448 action was required for the gp120 - induced acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin . In addition , we found that HDAC6 , acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin , and the MTOC were colocalized in T - cell pseu - dopodia at early stages during infection by HIV - 1 NL4 . 3 ( our unpublished data ) , indicating that HDAC6 is recruited at HIV - 1 / cell contact areas . HDAC6 Overexpression Impairs HIV - 1 Infection and Env - mediated Cell Fusion Because overexpression of HDAC6 prevented the HIV - 1 - gp120 - mediated acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin ( Figure 1A , wt - HDAC6 - gp120 - IIIB ) , we assessed the effect of HDAC6 deacetylase activity on HIV - 1 infection and fusion . Permis - sive MT - 2 cells were transduced by retroviral spinoculation with the wt or the dm form of HDAC6 - GFP ( Figure 2A , 70 – 75 % of cells expressed HDAC6 and (cid:6) 20 % of cells at high levels ) . These proteins were localized in the cytoplasm , a similar distribution to that of the endogenous HDAC6 ( Fig - ure 2C ; our unpublished data ) . Overexpression of functional HDAC6 - GFP diminished the acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin content of cells ( Figure 2C , diminished red ﬂuorescence in cells with arrowheads in wt - HDAC6 noninfected ) , whereas no changes in the levels of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin were seen in cells overex - pressing inactive HDAC6 - GFP ( Figure 2C , arrowhead in dm - HDAC6 noninfected ) . After HIV - 1 infection ( 1 h ) , acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin was only redistributed in parental or in dm - HDAC6 - MT - 2 cells ( Figure 2C , red ﬂuorescent capping in the cell la - beled with an arrowhead in dm - HDAC6 HIV - 1 NL4 . 3 ; our unpublished data ) . In contrast , acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin was not observed in MT - 2 cells expressing wt - HDAC6 - GFP ( Figure 2C , lack of red ﬂuorescence in cells labeled with an arrowhead in wt - HDAC6 , HIV - 1 NL4 . 3 ) . Remarkably , HIV - 1 infection in MT - 2 cells was strongly inhibited by overexpressing wt - HDAC6 but not in the pres - ence of dm - HDAC6 ( Figure 2E ) . Accordingly , wt - HDAC6 overexpression in J77 cells impaired Env - mediated cell – cell fusion with Env (cid:2) Hxbc2 cells ( Figure 2F , 6 h of fusion ) . The low levels of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin detected after overexpres - sion of wt - HDAC6 was correlated with the poor capacity of J77 cells in the fusion assays ( Figure 2F ) . As expected , very little acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin was detected in MT - 2 and J77 cells expressing wt - HDAC6 - GFP ( Figure 2 , B , C , and F , respec - tively ) . In contrast , MT - 2 cells expressing the dm - HDAC6 - GFP accumulated normal levels of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin ( Fig - ure 2 , B and C ) . MT - 2 cells expressing wt - HDAC6 - GFP or dm - HDAC6 - GFP did not undergo any signiﬁcant morpho - logical changes ( Figure 2C ) , and the expression of CD4 and CXCR4 remained unaltered ( Figure 2D ) . Similar results were obtained when we assessed the effect of HDAC6 activity on the gp120 / gp41 fusion capacity and on HIV - 1 infection in HeLa P5 or P4 cells ( Figure 3 ; our unpublished data ) . In these cells , wt - HDAC6 - GFP and dm - HDAC6 - GFP had a similar cytoplasmic distribution to the endogenous enzyme ( Figures 3A and 4A ) . The increase in wt - HDAC6 expression induced a signiﬁcant reduction in acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin , which was not observed with dm - HDAC6 overexpression ( Figure 3B ) . In agreement with the previous experiments , the expression of CD4 , CXCR4 , and CCR5 was not modiﬁed by the overexpression of HDAC6 in these cells ( Figure 3C ) . Under these conditions , wt - HDAC6 - GFP - transfected HeLa - permissive cells were much less sus - ceptible to infection by R5 - tropic ( Figure 3D , 79 % inhibition of infection in wt - HDAC6 - transfected HeLa P5 cells ) or X4 - tropic viral strains ( our unpublished data ) . Moreover , fusion with Env (cid:2) cells was inhibited by (cid:6) 80 % in wt - HDAC6 - transfected HeLa P5 cells ( Figure 3E , with R5 - tropic (cid:2) - HeLa ADA cells ) . These effects were not observed in dm - HDAC6 - GFP - transfected cells ( Figure 3 , D and E ) . These results indicate that the efﬁciency of HIV - 1 infection and Env - mediated cell fusion is inversely related to HDAC6 activity and directly related to the acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin cell content . HDAC6 Knockdown Enhances HIV - 1 Infection and Env - dependent Cell Fusion To further assess the role of HDAC6 on HIV - 1 infection and Env - dependent cell fusion , we analyzed the effects of silenc - ing HDAC6 expression . We found that a 50 % inhibition of HDAC6 expression obtained with the 217 siRNA oligo ( iRNA - 217 ) in HeLa P5 cells induced a three - to fourfold increase in acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin without affecting the levels of (cid:1) - tubulin , vimentin , CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CD4 ( Figure 4A ; our unpublished data ) . Immunostaining of endogenous HDAC6 and acetylated tubulin in cells with impaired HDAC6 expression showed that the strong increase of (cid:1) - tu - bulin acetylation was only observed in those cells where HDAC6 was knocked down ( Figure 4A , see cells labeled with an arrowhead ) . Thus , HDAC6 seems to regulate the cellular levels of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin . In addition , HeLa P5 cells in which HDAC6 expression was silenced were more permissive to infection with R5 - or X4 - tropic HIV - 1 viral particles ( Figure 4B ) . Moreover , HDAC6 silencing generated more fusogenic HeLa P5 cells ( Figure 4C ) , which formed larger syncytia ( Figure 4 , E and F , iRNA - 217 ) . To further corroborate the speciﬁcity of the func - tional knockdown of HDAC6 observed with the 20 nucleo - tides iRNA - oligo 217 , we assayed two other 20 - nucleotide oligos ( iRNA - 193 and iRNA - 284 ) speciﬁc for HDAC6 . When the effects of these oligos were compared with those of the iRNA - 217 oligo , all three effectively silenced endogenous HDAC6 expression in HeLa P4 ( Figure 4D ) and P5 cells ( our unpublished data ) , producing a three - to fourfold increase in the acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin ( Figure 4D ) . HDAC6 - silencing in HeLa P4 cells provoked an approximate increase of 80 % in the fusion with Env (cid:2) HeLa 243 cells ( Figure 4E , with iRNA - 193 , - 217 , and - 284 oligos ) . Furthermore , larger syncytia were formed ( Figure 4F , see large X - Gal - stained syncytia ) compared with untreated cells or cells treated with a scram - bled siRNA ( controls ) . These results conﬁrm the role played by endogenous HDAC6 in regulating the capacity of target cells to fuse with and to be infected by HIV - 1 . Furthermore , they rule out a possible transport effect of Tat on syncytia formation after siRNA treatment , because Tat might alter (cid:2) - Gal production but cannot affect the formation of large syncytia ( Figure 4F ) . Although these data prompt us to suggest that HDAC6 silencing enhances gp41 / gp120 fusion efﬁciency and HIV - 1 infection , additional effects on postentry processes cannot be excluded . HDAC6 Inhibition in PHA - activated PBL Enhances HIV - 1 Infection We also examined whether HDAC6 inhibition enhances HIV - 1 infection of primary lymphocytes . Due to the difﬁ - culty of silencing HDAC6 and then activating PBLs before HIV - 1 infection , we performed experiments with the chem - ical inhibitor of HDAC6 , TSA , and with NaBut , an inhibitor of nuclear HDACs that does not effect HDAC6 ( Hubbert et al . , 2002 ) . We found that a 2 - h exposure of PHA - activated PBLs to TSA ( 2 (cid:3) M ) enhanced HIV - 1 NL - 4 . 3 infection in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 5A ) . In contrast , high doses of NaBut had no effect on viral infection in these cells . Hence , increased TSA - mediated infection was correlated HDAC6 Regulates HIV - 1 Infection Vol . 16 , November 2005 5449 with the higher amounts of (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation stabilized by the drug ( Figure 5 , A – C , Western blot and immunoﬂuo - rescence with 2 (cid:3) M TSA ) . This enhancement was observed in assays where TSA was removed before the addition of HIV - 1 , whereas NaBut had no effect on viral infection under the same experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . The short incubation times used here rule out a possible effect of TSA on transcription in HIV - 1 replication ( Quivy et al . , 2002 ) . This conclusion was further supported in an Env - mediated cell – cell fusion model where PHA - activated PBLs were cocultured with Env (cid:2) - Hxbc2 cells for 12 h . For this purpose , PHA - activated PBLs were exposed to 2 (cid:3) M TSA or 500 (cid:3) M NaBut for 2 h , and the cells were then washed extensively to remove the drugs before coculturing for 12 h with Env (cid:2) - Hxbc2 cells at a ratio of 1 : 1 . TSA treatment strongly en - hanced the capacity of PHA - activated PBLs to fuse with R4 - tropic Env (cid:2) cells , producing a 94 % increase in fusion after exposure to TSA ( Figure 5D ) . In contrast , NaBut did not cause any change in Env - mediated fusion under the same experimental conditions ( Figure 5D ) . The effect of TSA on the fusion capacity of PHA - activated PBLs correlated with the ability of TSA to stabilize acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin ( Figure 5E , 5 - fold - increase ) , whereas NaBut did not induce (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation ( Figure 5E ) . As controls for the block - age of microtubule dynamics in Env - mediated fusion , Taxol and Nocodazole were used . Both drugs impaired the capacity of PHA - activated PBLs to fuse with Env (cid:2) - Hxbc2 cells but not the effects on (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation ( Figure 5E ) . On the other hand , TSA and NaBut did not alter the expres - sion of CD4 and CXCR4 in PHA - activated PBLs ( our unpub - lished data ) . Therefore , TSA seemed to enhance Env - mediated cell fu - sion and HIV - 1 infection through the inhibition of HDAC6 , as monitored by the increase in acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin ( Figure 5 , B and E ) . It is important to note that the effect of siRNA or TSA on HDAC6 and HIV - 1 infection could be inhibited by a neutralizing anti - CD4 mAb , by AZT , or with chemokines ( Figures 4B and 5A ) , indicating that HDAC6 silencing or Figure 3 . HDAC6 overexpression dimin - ishes the susceptibility of permissive HeLa cells to fuse and to be infected by HIV - 1 .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 5450 inhibition did not affect the ﬁrst Env / CD4 / coreceptor , or ligand / coreceptor interactions . Together , these results show a clear correlation between the silencing or inhibition of HDAC6 - tubulin deacetylase activity and an enhancement in the susceptibility of cells to fuse and to be infected by HIV - 1 . DISCUSSION The molecular events underlying HIV - mediated cell fusion play a key role in the process of HIV - 1 infection . Different reports suggest that each HIV - 1 - Env trimer interacts with multiple CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5 molecules ( Doms and Trono , 2000 ) and that multiple trimers are necessary for the formation of the fusion pore ( Layne et al . , 1990 ) . However , little information is available on the role of cytoskeleton in this process . Nevertheless , it has been reported that actin microﬁlaments regulate the clustering of CD4 and CXCR4 ( Iyengar et al . , 1998 ) and that actin and tubulin are involved in HIV - 1 transmission ( Pearce - Pratt et al . , 1994 ; Jolly et al . , 2004 ) and secretion ( Pearce - Pratt et al . , 1994 ) . How the dynamic state of the host plasma membrane regulates HIV - 1 virus infection is poorly understood . Exper - imental evidence indicates that short cortical microtubules are directly involved in controlling membrane dynamics ( Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1999 ) and cell migration , which in turn are controlled by HDAC6 - tubulin deacetylase activity ( Hubbert et al . , 2002 ) . Indeed , it has been shown that HADC6 regulates the redistribution of CD3 and LFA - 1 dur - ing immune synapse formation ( Serrador et al . , 2004 ) . In the present study , we show for the ﬁrst time that gp120 binding to CD4 in T lymphocytes induces acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin and that HDAC6 activity strongly inﬂuences the suscepti - bility of target cells to HIV - 1 infection , without affecting CD4 , CCR5 , and CXCR4 cell surface expression or distribu - tion . Quantitative analysis of (cid:1) - tubulin acetylation together with an enhancement of HIV - 1 fusion and infection when HDAC6 is silenced highlighted the inverse relationship be - tween susceptibility to HIV - 1 infection and HDAC6 - tubulin deacetylase activity . Remarkably , target cells that overexpress wt - HDAC6 - GFP and that are less permissive to fusion and infection by HIV - 1 display normal cell surface expression of CD4 and corecep - tor preferentially localized in the HIV - 1 - induced pseudo - podia . However , these cells contain reduced levels of acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin . Therefore , it is feasible that the redis - tribution of HDAC6 to the CXCR4 / CD4 capping regions diminishes the amount of cortical acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin at HIV - 1 / cell contact areas , resulting in changes in plasma membrane dynamics ( Hubbert et al . , 2002 ; Matsuyama et al . , 2002 ) and a diminished susceptibility to the changes induced Figure 4 .

HDAC6 Regulates HIV - 1 Infection Vol . 16 , November 2005 5451 by HIV - 1 . In this regard , acetylated (cid:1) - tubulin is a hydropho - bic form of tubulin that predominantly associates with the membrane by directly interacting with the transport protein Na (cid:2) , K (cid:2) - ATPase ( Nunez Fernandez et al . , 1997 ; Alonso et al . , 1998 ; Casale et al . , 2003 ) . Hence , we propose that the asso - ciation between the plasma membrane and acetylated (cid:1) - tu - bulin is strongly inﬂuenced by HDAC6 , regulating the dy - namic tension of the plasma membrane . This could conceivably be the mechanism by which HDAC6 regulates HIV - induced cell fusion and infection , affecting pore fusion formation by HIV - 1 - Env . In this respect , the binding of gp120 protein induces acetylation of (cid:1) - tubulin in permissive but not in wt - HDAC6 - transfected cells in a CD4 - dependent manner . In contrast with other HDAC class II enzymes , HDAC6 is mainly located in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells ( Verdel et al . , 2000 ; Hubbert et al . , 2002 ; Matsuyama et al . , 2002 ) . In - deed , it has been reported that HDAC6 possesses a potent nuclear - speciﬁc export signal at its N terminus ( Verdel et al . , 2000 ; Bertos et al . , 2004 ) , making it very unlikely that HDAC6 participates in histone deacetylation ( Verdel et al . , 2000 ; Bertos et al . , 2004 ) . Hence , our data indicate that cell signals that promote HDAC6 transcription and its subse - quent cytoplasmic export should induce a more protective phenotype to host cells against HIV - 1 infection . Accord - ingly , the different cellular levels of HDAC6 could account for the differential susceptibility shown by some cell types to HIV - 1 viral infection in vitro . However , it is also feasible that under certain conditions , HDAC6 could be located in the nucleus and participate in the control of HIV - 1 replication by repressing LTR activation . Cooperative interactions must take place among the viral envelope , cell receptors , and coreceptor molecules to permit viral entry ( Doms , 2000 ) . It has been shown that modifying the codistribution of CD4 and coreceptor molecules at the points of virus – cell contact may alter the process of pore fusion formation ( Dimitrov et al . , 1999 ; Xiao et al . , 2000 ) , thereby regulating HIV - 1 infection . However , our results indicate that the effect of HDAC6 on Env - mediated cell Figure 5 . HDAC6 inhibition enhances HIV - 1 infection and Env - mediated fusion in primary lymphocytes .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 5452 fusion and HIV - 1 infection is not exerted through altering the expression or colocalization of CD4 and CXCR4 . Taking into account all the experimental evidence , we conclude that HDAC6 regulates HIV - 1 infection , indepen - dently of the viral tropism . Although our data on Env - dependent cell fusion suggest a direct effect of HDAC6 on fusion pore formation , we cannot rule out any inﬂuence of HDAC6 on postentry events that regulate HIV - 1 infection . Therefore , it will be important to determine what cell signals regulate HDAC6 expression and its cytoplasmic distribution as well as to discover the speciﬁc HDAC6 - activating agents to design new anti - HIV - 1 therapeutic strategies .
