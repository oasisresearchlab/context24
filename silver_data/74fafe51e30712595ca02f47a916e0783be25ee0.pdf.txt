Coronin is a highly conserved actin - associ - ated protein that until now has had unknown biochemi - cal activities . Using microtubule affinity chromatogra - phy , we coisolated actin and a homologue of coronin , Crn1p , from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell extracts . Crn1p is an abundant component of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and binds to F - actin with high affinity ( K d 6 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 9 M ) . Crn1p promotes the rapid barbed - end as - sembly of actin filaments and cross - links filaments into bundles and more complex networks , but does not sta - bilize them . Genetic analyses with a crn1 (cid:68) deletion mutation also are consistent with Crn1p regulating fil - ament assembly rather than stability . Filament cross - linking depends on the coiled coil domain of Crn1p , suggesting a requirement for Crn1p dimerization . As - sembly - promoting activity is independent of cross - link - ing and could be due to nucleation and / or accelerated polymerization . Crn1p also binds to microtubules in vitro , and microtubule binding is enhanced by the pres - ence of actin filaments . Microtubule binding is medi - ated by a region of Crn1p that contains sequences ( not found in other coronins ) homologous to the microtu - bule binding region of MAP1B . These activities , con - sidered with microtubule defects observed in crn1 (cid:68) cells and in cells overexpressing Crn1p , suggest that Crn1p may provide a functional link between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in yeast . Key words : actin ¥ microtubule ¥ coronin ¥ cytoskele - ton ¥ yeast G ROWING evidence suggests that the actin and micro - tubule cytoskeletons function interdependently dur - ing a number of cellular processes , including cleav - age furrow positioning , neuronal growth cone steering , organelle transport , and nuclear migration ( Gavin , 1997 ) . In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , genetic ev - idence suggests that actin filaments and microtubules may function together during nuclear migration in mitotically dividing and mating cells ( Palmer et al . , 1992 ; Read et al . , 1992 ) . Nuclear and cytoplasmic microtubules in yeast ema - nate from spindle pole bodies , the yeast microtubule or - ganizing centers . Before mitosis , the nucleus rotates and migrates to a position near the bud neck . These nu - clear movements depend on cytoplasmic microtubules making transient attachments to the cell cortex ( reviewed in Stearns , 1997 ) . Although the molecular identities of the cortical attachment sites are unknown , genetic and micros - copy studies have led investigators to hypothesize that there may be multiple , functionally overlapping classes of attachment sites ( Shaw et al . , 1997 ) . Based on genetic data and their cellular locations , cortical actin patches are can - didates for microtubule attachment sites . In budding yeast , the actin cytoskeleton is composed of two classes of filamentous structures , cortical actin patches and cytoplasmic actin cables ( reviewed in Botstein et al . , 1997 ) . Throughout the mitotic cell cycle , the yeast actin cy - toskeleton is in a constant state of remodeling . These dy - namic changes in actin organization are regulated in part by actin - associated proteins , which modulate the nucle - ation , assembly , stabilization , cross - linking , and severing / depolymerization of actin filaments ( Pollard , 1993 ; Ay - scough , 1998 ) . We have isolated a novel component of the yeast corti - cal actin cytoskeleton , Crn1p ( coronin1p ) , which shares strong sequence homology with the conserved actin bind - ing protein coronin . Crn1p also contains an insert with two sequences ( not found in other coronins ) that share homol - Address correspondence to Dr .

Coronin was first identified as an actin - associated protein in Dictyostelium discoideum , where upon cell activation , it translocates to the cortical actin cy - toskeleton at crown - shaped cell surface projections ( de Hostos et al . , 1991 ; Gerisch et al . , 1995 ) . Deletion of the coronin gene in D . discoideum leads to defects in cell mi - gration , cytokinesis , phagocytosis , and fluid phase endocy - tosis ( de Hostos et al . , 1993 ; Maniak et al . , 1995 ; Hacker et al . , 1997 ) . More recently , homologues of coronin have been identified in C . elegans , sea urchin , and bovine tissues ( Suzuki et al . , 1995 ; Zaphiropoulos and Toftgard , 1996 ; Tera - saki et al . , 1997 ) , and a family of coronin genes has been identified in both mice and humans ( Okumura et al . , 1998 ) . Whereas some coronin isoforms are expressed ubiqui - tously , others show tissue - specific patterns of expression . Coronin also was localized recently to the actin filament tails of Listeria monocytogenes in infected mammalian cells ( David et al . , 1998 ) . This localization , as well as the localization of coronin to sites of dynamic actin assembly in migrating D . discoideum cells , suggests that coronin may be involved in regulating actin assembly . However , until now , the biochemical activities of coronin have been unknown . Here , we demonstrate that Crn1p promotes the rapid barbed - end assembly of actin filaments and cross - links them into bundles and networks . We also show that Crn1p binds to microtubules in vitro via its unique region and is capable of cross - linking actin filaments and microtubules . These activities , supported by genetic data presented here , raise the possibility that Crn1p may link functions of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in yeast . Materials and Methods Strains and Growth Conditions Yeast were grown using standard procedures and media as described in Guth - rie and Fink ( 1990 ) . The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I . Purification of Tubulin and Actin Bovine brain tubulin was purified as described in Mitchison and Kirschner ( 1984 ) by assembly and disassembly cycling . Tubulin was further purified by phosphocellulose and DEAE chromatography . Tubulin was eluted from the DEAE column with a linear salt gradient ( 0 . 1—0 . 6 M NaCl ) . Tu - bulin - containing fractions were pooled , desalted and concentrated at 4 (cid:56) C to 80 (cid:109) M in PME buffer ( 80 mM KOH - Pipes [ pH 6 . 8 ] , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA ) supplemented with 1 mM GTP using Centriprep 10 devices ( Ami - con ) . Tubulin was frozen in aliquots in liquid N 2 and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Yeast tubulin was purified and stored as described previously ( Barnes et al . , 1992 ) . Yeast actin was purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized DNase I and formamide as an eluant ( Zechel , 1980 ) . Fresh , commercially available yeast ( Red Star Yeast ) were washed once in 2 vol of H 2 O , resus - pended in 0 . 2 vol of H 2 O , frozen in liquid N 2 as 200—400 - (cid:109) l drops and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . To lyse cells , (cid:122) 40—100 g of frozen yeast were transferred to a stainless steel Waring blender ( 1 liter ) , to which liquid nitrogen was added to just cover the yeast . The frozen yeast were blended for 20—30 s on high speed , until all of the liquid nitrogen evaporated from the cham - ber . More liquid nitrogen was added to the blender to cover the yeast powder , and the blending cycle was repeated four more times . The lysed yeast cells can be stored as a frozen powder at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C for months without detectable degradation . A DNase I affinity column was constructed by coupling 200 mg of DNase I ( Boehringer ) to 20 ml of Affigel - 10 ( BioRad ) . The DNase I cou - pled resin was loaded into a 2 . 5 - cm - diam column ( BioRad ) and washed with 5 column volumes of G - buffer ( 10 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) . To prepare a yeast high speed supernatant ( HSS ) , (cid:122) 250 g of frozen , lysed yeast powder was mixed at a 1 : 1 ratio ( wt / vol ) with G - buffer supplemented with 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors ( 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [ PMSF ] and 1 (cid:109) g / ml each of anti - pain , leupeptin , pepstatin A , chymostatin , and aprotinin ) . The mixture was stirred continuously with a spatula at room temperature until all of the visible ice chunks were thawed . While still cold , the mixture was cen - trifuged at 45 , 000 rpm for 2 h in a Beckman 45Ti rotor at 4 (cid:56) C . The super - natant was carefully removed by pipetting , and was filtered through six layers of cheesecloth into a beaker on ice . The HSS ( (cid:122) 200 ml ) was loaded onto a DNase I affinity column at a flow rate of 2 ml / min . The column was washed sequentially with 40 ml of G - buffer , 40 ml of G - buffer plus 0 . 2 M NH 4 Cl , 40 ml of G - buffer plus 10 % deionized formamide , and 40 ml of G - buffer . The actin was eluted from the column with 40 ml of G - buffer plus 50 % deionized formamide . ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 was added to 0 . 35 g / ml and dissolved by gentle mixing . The actin was precipitated by overnight incu - bation on ice , followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12 , 000 g , 4 (cid:56) C . The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of G - buffer and dialyzed twice , 4 h each , against 1 liter of G - buffer . The yeast actin was precleared in a microfuge for 5 min at 4 (cid:56) C , concentrated at 4 (cid:56) C to 40—70 (cid:109) M in Centricon 10 devices , frozen in aliquots in liquid N 2 , and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Isolation of S . cerevisiae Proteins on a Microtubule Affinity Column Microtubule affinity columns were constructed using taxol - stabilized bo - vine microtubules as described ( Miller et al . , 1991 ; Barnes et al . , 1992 ) .

Regulation of Actin and Microtubule Functions by Yeast Coronin 85 Yeast extracts were prepared as follows : yeast were grown in YPD to an optical density of 1 at 600 nm , washed once in 2 vol of H 2 O , resuspended in 0 . 2 vol of H 2 O , frozen in liquid nitrogen as 200—400 - (cid:109) l drops , and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . The frozen yeast were lysed as described above . A HSS was prepared for the microtubule affinity column by mixing frozen lysed yeast powder at a 1 : 1 ratio ( wt / vol ) with room temperature buffer C ( 50 mM KOH - Hepes [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM EDTA ) , sup - plemented with 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors ( as above ) . The thawed mixture was centrifuged at 40 , 000 rpm for 60 min in a Beckman type 40 rotor at 4 (cid:56) C . The supernatant was removed by pipetting and fil - tered through six layers of cheesecloth . Then , 10 % glycerol ( vol / vol ) was added to the HSS to stabilize proteins as described in Miller et al . ( 1991 ) . At a flow rate of 2 ml / h , 20 ml of the HSS and glycerol was loaded onto either a 1 - ml microtubule or BSA control column ( (cid:122) 1 mg / ml protein at - tached to a 1 : 1 mixture of Affigel 10 [ BioRad ] and CL6B sepharose [ Phar - macia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ] ) at 4 (cid:56) C . The columns were washed with 40 ml buffer CX ( buffer C , supplemented with 1 mM DTT , protease inhib - itors and 10 % glycerol [ vol / vol ] ) . Proteins were eluted from the columns by sequential washes of 10 ml buffer CX plus 1 mM ATP and 1 mM GTP , 0 . 1 M KCl and 0 . 5 M KCl , collecting 1 - ml fractions . Half of each fraction was TCA precipitated ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining to identify microtubule column - spe - cific proteins . The remaining half of the relevant fractions were desalted and concentrated in Centricon 10 devices . Samples were digested with trypsin . The resulting peptides were analyzed by LC / MS / MS tandem mass spectrometry and matched to proteins in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ge - nome database as described in McCormack et al . ( 1997 ) . Plasmid Construction and Deletion of the CRN1 Gene The coding region of CRN1 ( YLR429w ) was amplified from S288C yeast genomic DNA using the Expand PCR kit from Boehringer with 5 (cid:57) and 3 (cid:57) primers ( GATGCGGCCGCCTCTTGACCAAATACGATGATTCT - TCC and AGAGAATCCGATTAAAATGATTCTTCAGCCATGTG - GCCG , respectively ) . The PCR products were digested with NotI and BamHI and ligated into the NotI and BamHI sites of the Bluescript KS (cid:49) vector ( Stratagene ) . The resulting plasmid is referred to as pBS - CRN1 . pcrn1 (cid:68) : : LEU2 was generated by replacing the 1 , 156 - bp MscI - BglII frag - ment of pBS - CRN1 with a 2 , 220—bp HindIII - BamHI LEU2 gene frag - ment . To construct GST - CRN1 fusion plasmids for expression in bacteria , DNA sequences encoding amino acids 1—651 , 1—599 , 1—400 , and 400—651 of yeast coronin were amplified from pBS - CRN1 by PCR using primers that generate BamHI and NsiI sites at the 5 (cid:57) and 3 (cid:57) ends , respectively . The PCR products were ligated into BamHI - NsiI digested pGAT2 vector ( a GST - fusion derivative of pBAT ; Per(cid:138)nen et al . , 1996 ) to generate pGAT2 - CRN ( 1—651 ) , pGAT2 - CRN ( 1—599 ) , pGAT2 - CRN ( 1—400 ) , and pGAT2 - CRN ( 400—651 ) . To construct a GFP - CRN1 fusion plasmid , the coding sequence of CRN1 was amplified from pBS - CRN1 by PCR using primers that generate BamHI and XbaI sites at the 5 (cid:57) and 3 (cid:57) ends , respec - tively . The PCR product was ligated into BamHI - XbaI cut pTS408 ( Car - minati and Stearns , 1997 ) to generate a CEN plasmid with a GFP - CRN1 fusion gene under control of the GAL10 promoter . To construct a GST - CRN1 fusion for expression in yeast , the BamHI - XbaI insert described above was ligated into BamHI - XbaI digested pEGKT vector ( Mitchell et al . , 1993 ) to generate pEGKT - CRN1 . All PCR - generated insertions were sequenced to insure that mutations were not introduced into the CRN1 se - quences . To generate disruptions of the CRN1 gene , pcrn1 (cid:68) : : LEU2 was linear - ized and used to transform the diploid strain DDY1090 . Leu (cid:49) transfor - mants were isolated on selective medium and deletion of the CRN1 gene was verified by PCR with primers to sequences in LEU2 and outside of the CRN1 coding region . Hemizygotes were sporulated and the resulting tetrads dissected . Tetrad progeny showed a 2 : 2 segregation of the LEU2 marker . Loss of CRN1 gene expression in Leu (cid:49) haploids was verified by immunoblotting with Crn1p antibodies . Recombinant Crn1p Expression and Purification Full - length and partial coding sequences of CRN1 were expressed as glu - tathione - S - transferase ( GST ) 1 fusion proteins in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells as described ( Per(cid:138)nen et al . , 1996 ) . Cells transformed with pGAT2 - CRN ( 1—651 ) , pGAT2 - CRN ( 1—599 ) , pGAT2 - CRN ( 1—400 ) , and pGAT2 - CRN ( 400 - 651 ) were grown in 2 , 000 ml of LB medium (cid:49) 100 (cid:109) g / ml ampi - cillin at 37 (cid:56) C . At an optical density of 0 . 5 at 600 nm , expression was induced by the addition of 0 . 4 mM isopropyl - thio - (cid:98) - D - galactoside ( IPTG ) . After 4 h , cells were pelleted , washed with 40 ml PBS , resuspended in 30 ml PBS plus 1 mM PMSF and lysed by sonication . The lysate was centrifuged at 10 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 (cid:56) C in an SA600 rotor ( Sorvall / DuPont ) . The GST fusion proteins were purified from the supernatants using glu - tathione - agarose beads ( 0 . 5 ml ) . The glutathione agarose - bound GST - Crn1p fusion proteins were incubated overnight in 1 ml PBS containing 0 . 02 mg / ml thrombin to release coronin into the supernatant . To remove the thrombin , the supernatant was mixed with 50 (cid:109) l of thrombin - binding p - aminobenzamidine - agarose ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) and tumbled for 30 min at 4 (cid:56) C . The beads were pelleted to remove thrombin , and the super - natant was loaded directly onto a 5 / 5 mono Q column ( Pharmacia ) equili - brated in buffer B ( 20 mM KOH - Hepes [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 50 mM KCl ) . The col - umn was washed with 10 ml buffer B and the proteins were eluted using a linear salt gradient ( 0 . 1—0 . 5 M KCl ) . Crn1p - containing fractions were identified by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . The desired frac - tions were pooled , concentrated to 20—30 (cid:109) M , desalted at 4 (cid:56) C in a Centricon 10 device , frozen in aliquots in liquid N 2 and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Generation of Anti - Crn1p Antibodies and Immunoblotting Three mice were immunized with recombinant full - length Crn1p to pro - duce polyclonal ascites antibodies . On days 1 , 8 , and 20 , each mouse re - ceived 25—50 (cid:109) g of Crn1p diluted in PBS to 100 (cid:109) l and mixed 1 : 1 with RIBI ( Ribi ImmunoChem ) . On day 27 , tailbleed immunoreactivity ( 1 : 500 dilution ) was tested on immunoblots of total wild - type and crn1 (cid:68) cell pro - teins . Two mice sera recognized Crn1p , and these mice were immunized again on day 28 . On day 33 , the mice were injected subcutaneously with sarcoma cells to induce the formation of ascites fluid , which was tapped on day 45 . The ascites fluid ( (cid:122) 10 ml from each mouse ) was centrifuged for 5 min at 13 , 000 rpm in a microfuge and the supernatant frozen in 1 - ml ali - quots in liquid N 2 and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Antibodies were used at 1 : 1 , 000 di - lution on immunoblots and 1 : 100 dilution for immunofluorescence . Immu - noblotting was performed by standard methods ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) using 1 : 1 , 000 dilutions of antibodies that recognize Crn1p and yeast actin . Actin Filament and Microtubule Cosedimentation Assays For actin filament cosedimentation assays , filaments were assembled from purified yeast actin in G - buffer by the addition of 0 . 1 - vol of 10 (cid:51) Initiation Mix ( IM ) buffer : ( 20 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 M KCl , 5 mM ATP ) and incubated for 30 min at 25 (cid:56) C . For microtubule cosedimentation assays , purified bo - vine brain tubulin was assembled in 30 % glycerol and 1 mM GTP for 30 min at 35 (cid:56) C , then stabilized by addition of 20 (cid:109) M taxol . Microtubules di - lutions were made in buffer C supplemented with 10 (cid:109) M taxol and 1 mM GTP . F - actin and microtubule cosedimentation assays both were per - formed using 40 - (cid:109) l reactions , containing variable concentrations of Crn1p fragments and actin filaments or microtubules . The reactions were incu - bated for 20 min at 25 (cid:56) C , and then centrifuged for 30 min at 25 (cid:56) C , 90 , 000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman ) . Equal portions of the pellets and su - pernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining or im - munoblotting with Crn1p antibodies . For determining the dissociation constant ( K d ) of the Crn1p : F - actin binding interaction , 10 (cid:109) M phalloidin was added to the reaction buffers to stabilize the actin filaments . Actin Filament Bundling Assays Three assays were used to test the effects of Crn1p on actin filament bun - dling : low speed pelleting assay , falling ball assay to measure apparent vis - cosity , and visualization of filaments by electron microscopy . For low speed pelleting assays , various concentrations of Crn1p were added to preassembled yeast actin filaments ( 2 (cid:109) M ) and incubated for 15 min at 25 (cid:56) C . The reactions were centrifuged at low speed ( 13 , 000 g ) for 3 min , and the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coo - massie staining . Actin filaments remain in the supernatant under these centrifugation conditions , whereas F - actin bundles pellet . The falling ball assay was used to measure apparent viscosity ( Pollard and Cooper , 1982 ) . These assays were performed using actin filaments at steady state . In one set of reactions ( see Fig . 3 ) , variable concentrations of Crn1p were added 1 .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 144 , 1999 86 to preassembled F - actin ( 7 (cid:109) M final concentration ) , and , after incubation at 25 (cid:56) C for 30 min , viscosity was measured . In a different set of reactions ( see Fig . 4 ) , variable concentrations of Crn1p were copolymerized with monomeric actin ( 7 (cid:109) M ) for 30 min at 25 (cid:56) C , and then viscosity was mea - sured . Aliquots from both sets of reactions were removed and spotted onto copper grids freshly coated with formvar , negatively stained with 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate , and examined using a transmission electron mi - croscope . Actin Filament Assembly and Disassembly Assays For light scattering assays , purified yeast actin ( 50 (cid:109) M ) in G - buffer was thawed overnight at 4 (cid:56) C and precleared by centrifugation for 60 min at 4 (cid:56) C , 90 , 000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor . Then , 80 (cid:109) l of monomeric actin ( 6 . 25 (cid:109) M ) was added to 10 (cid:109) l of 10 (cid:51) IM buffer and 10 (cid:109) l of Crn1p or buffer . The re - actions contained a final concentration of 5 (cid:109) M G - actin and 0 , 0 . 1 , or 0 . 5 (cid:109) M Crn1p . The reaction was mixed by pipetting and immediately transferred to a quartz fluorometer cuvette with 3 - mm light path ( Helma ) , marking time 0 . Actin filament assembly was monitored by increase in light scatter - ing at 400 nm in a F - 4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer ( Hitachi ) at 25 (cid:56) C . To prevent bubble formation , all solutions were brought to room temperature before use in the assay . To reduce noise in the spectra , solu - tions were precleared immediately before use by centrifugation for 5 min , 13 , 000 g . Steady state assembly of actin was reached by 20—25 min in all re - actions , as determined by light scattering and measurement of polymer mass . To measure polymer mass , samples at time points were centrifuged for 30 min at 25 (cid:56) C , 90 , 000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor and the actin levels in the supernatants and pellets were determined by SDS - PAGE and Coo - massie staining . For pyrene - actin assembly assays , variable concentrations of Crn1p were added to 5 (cid:109) M monomeric actin ( 4 (cid:109) M yeast actin (cid:49) 1 (cid:109) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin ; Cytoskeleton ) and assembly initiation salts at time 0 . Assembly was monitored by change in pyrene fluorescence at exci - tation 365 nm , emission 407 nm in a fluorometer . For F - actin disassembly assays , different concentrations of Crn1p , Sac6p or cytochalasin D were added to 5 (cid:109) M preassembled actin filaments ( 4 (cid:109) M yeast actin and 1 (cid:109) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin ) and incubated for 15 min at 25 (cid:56) C . Fil - ament disassembly was initiated at time 0 by the addition of 40 (cid:109) M latrun - culin A ( an actin monomer sequestering agent ) , and disassembly was monitored by change in pyrene fluorescence as above . Determination of Actin Critical Concentration To measure the effects of Crn1p on actin Cc , three different concentra - tions of purified yeast actin filaments ( 0 . 5 , 1 , or 2 (cid:109) M ) were mixed with Crn1p at four different stoichiometries of Crn1p : actin ( 0 : 1 , 1 : 10 , 1 : 3 , or 1 : 1 ) . After incubation at 25 (cid:56) C , the actin filaments were pelleted by centrifuga - tion for 30 min at 90 , 000 rpm , 25 (cid:56) C in a TLA100 rotor . The levels of actin in the supernatants were determined by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . Light Microscopy Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described in Ayscough and Drubin ( 1997 ) . To disrupt the actin cytoskeleton , log - phase yeast cultures were treated with 400 (cid:109) M latrunculin A for 5 min before chemical fixation ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . The localization of a green fluo - rescent protein ( GFP ) - Crn1p fusion protein under the expression of the GAL10 promoter was examined in living yeast cells . Cells transformed with pGFP - CRN1 were grown in synthetic selective media plus glucose to log - phase ( OD 600 0 . 2 ) , washed once and transferred to synthetic selective media plus 2 % galactose . After 12 h of growth at 25 (cid:56) C , cells were mounted on slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy . Fluid - phase endocytosis in wild - type ( DDY1088 ) and crn1 (cid:68) cells ( DDY1521 ) was as - sayed by uptake of the fluorescent dye lucifer yellow as described ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . Overexpression of GST - Crn1p was induced from the 2 (cid:109) plas - mid pEGKT - CRN1 , marked with both URA3 and leu2 - d . To achieve a high number of plasmids , wild - type cells ( DDY130 ) transformed with pEGKT - CRN1 were grown in minimal media lacking uracil and leucine . Induction of expression from the GAL10 promoter was achieved as de - scribed above . Results Isolation of Actin and the YLR429w Gene Product by Microtubule Affinity Chromatography In a previous report , we used LC / MS / MS tandem mass spectrometry to identify S . cerevisiae proteins purified from yeast extracts by cosedimentation with microtubules ( McCormack et al . , 1997 ) . Here , we used similar analyses and identified two proteins of 48 and 85 kD that were iso - lated from S . cerevisiae extracts by microtubule affinity chromatography . A fraction eluted from the microtubule column by 0 . 5 M KCl contains three prominent bands of apparent molecular masses 48 , 55 , and 85 kD ( Fig . 1 A ) . Different proteins , which are not shown , were eluted by 0 . 1 M KCl before the 0 . 5 M KCl elution . All of the pep - tides identified in this sample are listed in Fig . 1 A and were derived from either actin or the YLR429w gene product . Subsequent immunoblotting verified that the 48 - kD band is yeast actin , the 55 - kD band is bovine tubulin , which leaches off the column in high salt washes , and the 85 - kD protein is the product of the YLR429w gene . Bovine tubu - lin peptides were not identified by the mass spectrometry analysis because they are not present in the S . cerevisiae genome database . The YLR429w Gene Product Shares Sequence Homology with an Actin Binding Protein and a Microtubule - associated Protein The YLR429w gene is predicted to encode a 651—amino acid protein ( Fig . 1 B ) with a mass of 72 . 5 kD . BLAST searches ( Pearson and Lipman , 1988 ) revealed that YLR429w is homologous to members of the coronin family of actin - binding proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans , Dictyostel - ium discoideum , Bos taurus , and Homo sapiens ( deHostos et al . , 1991 ; Suzuki et al . , 1995 ; Zaphiropoulos and Toft - gard , 1996 ) . The YLR429w gene , which was named CRN1 ( coronin1 ) , does not show strong homology to any other genes in the S . cerevisiae database . Alignment of the pri - mary sequences of coronins from different species showed that they are highly conserved and have similar domain structures ( Fig . 1 C ) . The regions shaded in Fig . 1 C share (cid:122) 45 % amino acid identity . The NH 2 terminus ( amino ac - ids 1—400 in Crn1p ) contains five WD - repeats , structural motifs found in proteins of diverse function and which form a (cid:98) - propeller - like conformation in the (cid:98) subunit of het - erotrimeric G proteins ( Neer et al . , 1994 ; Wall et al . , 1995 ) . The COOH termini ( last 50 amino acids ) of all known coronins are strongly predicted ( a probability of 1 on Pro - site ) to form (cid:97) - helical coiled coil structures . Each coronin also contains a unique region that varies greatly in length and is distinct in sequence . The unique region of Crn1p ( boxed in Fig . 1 B ) shares no significant sequence homology with the unique regions of other coro - nins . However , two sequences in the Crn1p unique region ( amino acids 408—466 and 535—568 ; underlined in Fig . 1 B ) share 32 / 53 % and 33 / 58 % amino acid sequence identity / similarity , respectively , with a sequence in mammalian mi - crotubule - associated protein MAP1B ( amino acids 646—732 ) that has been shown to be sufficient for microtubule bind - ing in vitro and in vivo ( Noble et al . , 1989 ) . Fig . 1 D shows a sequence alignment between a segment of the MAP1B Goode et al . Regulation of Actin and Microtubule Functions by Yeast Coronin 87 microtubule binding region that contains a KKE / D microtu - bule binding motif and a short sequence in the Crn1p unique region . The Abundance of Crn1p in Yeast Cells Full - length Crn1p was expressed in E . coli and purified as described ( see Materials and Methods ) . The resulting pro - tein is soluble and has an apparent molecular mass of 85 kD on SDS - PAGE gels , similar to that of Crn1p identified on immunoblots of yeast extracts . Antibodies were generated against Crn1p . The immunoreactivity of the antibodies is highly specific on immunoblots ( Fig . 2 A ) . To estimate the abundance of Crn1p in yeast cells , total proteins from an asynchronously dividing culture of wild - type yeast ( DDY1090 ) were immunoblotted in parallel with known amounts of purified yeast actin and Crn1p . The blots were probed with actin and Crn1p antibodies and the signals from yeast extracts and purified proteins were compared ( not shown ) . Consistent with previous reports , actin com - prised (cid:122) 0 . 1 % of total cellular protein ( Karpova et al . , 1995 ) . Crn1p comprised (cid:122) 0 . 01 % of total cellular protein . Thus , Crn1p is (cid:122) 10 - fold less abundant than actin , and is similar in abundance to capping protein and cofilin in yeast ( Karpova et al . , 1995 ; P . Lappalainen , unpublished results ) . Crn1p Binds to Actin Filaments and Microtubules In Vitro Previous studies have shown that coronin from Dictyostel - ium discoideum and Bos taurus binds directly to actin fila - ments in vitro ( de Hostos et al . , 1991 ; Suzuki et al . , 1995 ) . First , we tested whether yeast coronin ( Crn1p ) binds to ac - Figure 1 . ( A ) Coisolation from yeast extracts of actin and Crn1p on a microtubule affinity column . Proteins were isolated from S . cerevi - siae extracts using an affinity column containing taxol - sta - bilized bovine microtubules ( see Materials and Methods ) . Shown is a Coomassie - stained gel of proteins eluted from the column by 0 . 5 M KCl . The proteins in this fraction were digested with trypsin , and the resulting peptides were identified by LC / MS / MS tandem mass spectrometry and matched to predicted gene products in the S . cerevisiae genome da - tabase . All of the yeast pep - tides identified in the column fraction shown were derived from actin or the product of the YLR429w gene . The pep - tide sequences are shown ad - jacent to the protein bands from which they were de - rived . ( B ) Predicted amino acid sequence of the YLR429w ( CRN1 ) gene product .

( C ) Alignment of the domain structures of S . cerevisiae , C . elegans , D . discoideum , B . taurus , and H . sapiens coronins . Each protein contains a conserved WD repeat region and COOH - terminal coiled - coil domain ( shaded regions ) . In addition , each coronin has a COOH - terminal unique region ( not shaded ) .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 144 , 1999 88 tin filaments in vitro . Initial cosedimentation assays with purified Crn1p and yeast actin filaments showed that Crn1p binds with high affinity to F - actin ( K d below 0 . 2 (cid:109) M ) . The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by the ability of excess recombinant Crn1p to compete with ra - dio - labeled in vitro translated Crn1p for F - actin binding ( not shown ) . To measure the strength of the Crn1p—F - actin binding interaction , it was necessary to reduce the Crn1p and F - actin concentrations in the reactions to nanomolar levels . Because F - actin disassembles under these condi - tions ( the critical concentration of yeast actin is 0 . 1—0 . 2 (cid:109) M ) , 10 (cid:109) M phalloidin was added to stabilize the actin fil - aments . A constant concentration of Crn1p ( 0 . 5 nM ) was added to variable concentrations of phalloidin - stabilized yeast actin filaments ( 0 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , and 128 nM ) in a cosedimentation assay . To control for nonspecific interac - tions that could occur at such low concentrations of actin filaments and Crn1p , 0 . 1 mg / ml BSA was included in these reactions . The pellets and supernatants were immuno - blotted and probed with Crn1p antibodies ( Fig . 2 B ) . At F - actin concentrations of 4 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 9 M and 8 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 9 M , (cid:122) 40 and 60 % of the Crn1p bound to F - actin , respectively . At higher concentrations , (cid:46) 80 % of the Crn1p bound to F - actin . From these data , we estimate that the apparent dissociation constant ( K d ) of the interaction is (cid:122) 6 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 9 M ( 6 nM ) , which indicates a very strong interaction in com - parison to other characterized actin binding proteins ( Pol - lard , 1993 ) . To determine the stoichiometry of binding at saturation , we used a constant concentration of actin filaments ( 1 (cid:109) M ) and variable concentrations of Crn1p ( 0 . 125 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , and 4 (cid:109) M ) in a cosedimentation as - say . F - actin binding saturated at a 1 : 1 molar ratio of Crn1p to F - actin ( not shown ) . To test the ability of Crn1p to bind to microtubules , variable concentrations of taxol - stabilized bovine microtu - bules were added to Crn1p ( 0 . 5 (cid:109) M ) in a cosedimentation assay ( Fig . 2 C ) . Crn1p bound weakly to microtubules , but in a concentration - dependent manner , suggesting a spe - cific binding interaction . Approximately 20 % of the Crn1p bound at 2 (cid:109) M microtubules , and (cid:122) 40 % bound at 10 (cid:109) M microtubules , suggesting a modest K d of 15—20 (cid:109) M . Simi - lar affinities were observed using yeast microtubules or in vitro translated Crn1p . Crn1p Cross - links Actin Filaments into Bundles Next , we tested the effects of Crn1p on actin filament cross - linking using a low speed pelleting assay ( Sandrock et al . , 1997 ) . Neither F - actin nor Crn1p alone pelleted upon centrifugation at low speeds ( 15 , 000 g ) . However , the addition of Crn1p to preassembled actin filaments caused low speed pelleting of a Crn1p—F - actin complex ( Fig . 3 A ) . This result suggests that Crn1p cross - links actin filaments , but does not reveal whether Crn1p forms actin bundles or more complex networks or gels . Therefore , we measured the effects of Crn1p on the apparent viscosity of actin solutions using the falling ball assay ( Pollard and Cooper , 1982 ) . In this assay , the formation of orthogonal networks or gels increases apparent viscosity , whereas the formation of F - actin bundles decreases apparent viscosity . As shown in Fig . 3 B , the addition of Crn1p to preassem - bled actin filaments led to a concentration - dependent de - crease in apparent viscosity , suggesting the formation of F - actin bundles . As a positive control for bundling , we measured the ef - fects of Sac6p / fimbrin on apparent viscosity . As shown in Fig . 3 B , purified yeast Sac6p / fimbrin caused a concentra - tion - dependent decrease in solution viscosity below con - centrations of 0 . 7 (cid:109) M Sac6p ( (cid:122) 1 Sac6p to 10 actin molar stoichiometry ) . However , at higher concentrations / molar ratios of Sac6p to actin , the apparent viscosity increased . Examination of these reactions by electron microscopy revealed large aggregates of bundled F - actin that likely impaired the mobility of the falling ball in capillary tubes . Similarly , we observed discontinuous falling ball migration in reactions containing concentrations of Crn1p above 2 . 5 (cid:109) M ( 5 and 10 (cid:109) M ) . These data are not shown in Fig . 3 B be - cause in these reactions the migration of the ball was highly sporadic ( often stalling ) , thus making measure - ments unreliable . Electron microscopy revealed similar tangles of actin filament bundles at these high concentra - tions of Crn1p ( not shown ) . Because Crn1p is present in yeast at a molar ratio of (cid:122) 1 Crn1p per 10 actin subunits , 1 : 10 ratios in viscosity assays may be most relevant in vivo . A 1 : 10 ratio of either Crn1p or Sac6p to actin caused a de - crease in viscosity and the formation of long actin filament bundles seen by electron microscopy ( Fig . 3 C ) . Figure 2 . Crn1p binds to actin filaments and microtubules . ( A ) Immunoblot of total wild - type ( WT ) and crn1 (cid:68) cell proteins probed with coronin antibodies . ( B ) Crn1p binds to actin fila - ments with high affinity . Crn1p ( 0 . 5 nM ) was mixed with variable concentrations of phalloidin - stabilized yeast actin filaments . Af - ter incubation , the actin filaments were pelleted , and the pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immuno - blotting with Crn1p antibodies . ( C ) Crn1p binds to microtubules with weak affinity . Full - length Crn1p ( 0 . 5 (cid:109) M ) was mixed with variable concentrations of taxol - stabilized bovine brain microtu - bules . After incubation , the microtubules were pelleted , and the pellets ( P ) and supernatants ( S ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . Goode et al . Regulation of Actin and Microtubule Functions by Yeast Coronin 89 Microtubules Cosediment with Crn1p—F - Actin Bundles The isolation of Crn1p on microtubule affinity columns suggested that Crn1p can form a stable complex with mi - crotubules , but as documented above ( Fig . 2 C ) , the in vitro binding interaction between microtubules and Crn1p is weak ( 15—20 (cid:109) M ) . To address the possibility that post - translational modifications of Crn1p might increase the Crn1p binding affinity for microtubules ( recombinant Crn1p was used for the studies described above ) , we performed cosedimentation assays by adding taxol - stabilized bovine brain microtubules to yeast extracts , and after Crn1p cosedimentation by immunoblotting . However , the mea - sured affinity was similar to that in Fig . 2 C ( not shown ) . This prompted us to test whether the third component of the complex isolated on the microtubule affinity column ( actin ) , might stabilize the Crn1p - microtubule binding in - teraction . First , we tested whether the presence of G - actin ( under nonpolymerizing conditions ) influenced the affin - ity of Crn1p for microtubules , but it did not ( not shown ) . Next , we tested the effects of F - actin on the Crn1p - micro - tubule interaction by assaying for microtubule cosedi - mentation with Crn1p—F - actin bundles at low speeds . The results are shown in Fig . 3 D , and were quantitated by scanning densitometry . Background levels of tubulin pelleting ( 12—18 % ) were observed in reactions that contained microtubules alone or microtubules in the presence of Sac6p / fimbrin , Crn1p , or F - actin alone ( Fig . 3 , lanes 1—6 ) . As expected , the addi - tion of Sac6p or Crn1p to actin filaments led to actin fila - ment bundling and pelleting of the actin at low speed ( lanes 7—10 ) . Importantly , microtubule pelleting did not in - crease above background in the presence of Sac6p—F - actin Figure 3 . Crn1p bundles actin filaments and can cross - link actin filaments and microtubules . ( A ) Low speed pelleting of Crn1p—F - actin complexes . Crn1p ( 0 . 5 (cid:109) M ) or Crn1p ( (cid:68) 600—651 ; 0 . 5 (cid:109) M ) was mixed with preassembled yeast actin filaments ( 2 (cid:109) M ) , incubated for 15 min at 25 (cid:56) C , and centrifuged for 3 min at low speed ( 13 , 000 g ) . The pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coo - massie staining . ( B ) Crn1p decreases the apparent viscosity of actin filament solutions in a concentration - dependent manner . Variable concentrations of Crn1p or yeast fimbrin / Sac6p ( 0 . 15—2 . 5 (cid:109) M ) were added to preassembled actin filaments ( 7 (cid:109) M ) , and apparent viscos - ity was measured by the falling ball assay . ( C ) Electron micrographs of Crn1p - actin filament bundles and fimbrin / Sac6p - actin filament bundles . Crn1p or Sac6p ( 0 . 5 (cid:109) M ) was added to preassembled yeast actin filaments ( 5 (cid:109) M ) , incubated for 30 min at 25 (cid:56) C , then nega - tively stained and examined by electron microscopy . ( D ) Cosedimentation of microtubules with Crn1p - F - actin bundles . 4 (cid:109) M taxol - sta - bilized microtubules , 4 (cid:109) M preassembled F - actin , 2 (cid:109) M Crn1p , and 2 (cid:109) M Sac6p were mixed in the combinations indicated in the figure and incubated for 30 min at 25 (cid:56) C . The reactions then were centrifuged at low speed ( 13 , 000 g ) for 3 min , and the pellets and superna - tants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE gels and Coomassie staining . Bar , 200 nm . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 144 , 1999 90 bundles ( 17 % ; lanes 9 and 10 ) . This reaction serves as a control for nonspecific trapping of microtubules by actin bundles . As shown in lanes 7 and 8 , there is a pronounced increase in microtubule pelleting ( 65 % ) in the presence of Crn1p—F - actin bundles . This result suggests that Crn1p can directly cross - link microtubules and actin filaments with an apparent affinity of (cid:122) 2 (cid:109) M , (cid:122) 10 - fold stronger than the interaction between Crn1p and microtubules in Figure 4 . Crn1p promotes the rapid barbed - end assembly and cross - linking of actin filaments into branched networks . ( A ) Effects of Crn1p on assembly kinetics of yeast actin by light scattering assay . Monomeric yeast actin ( 5 (cid:109) m ) in G - buffer was mixed with variable concentrations of Crn1p and assembly initiation salts at time 0 . Actin filament assembly was monitored by change in light scattering at 400 nm in a spectrophotometer . Steady state actin filament assembly was reached by 20 min in all reactions , and at this point reactions contained similar polymer levels ( see Materials and Methods ) . ( B ) Effects of Crn1p on the assembly kinetics of pyrene - actin . Variable concentrations of Crn1p ( 0 , 0 . 5 , or 1 (cid:109) M ) were added to 5 (cid:109) M actin ( 4 (cid:109) M yeast actin and 1 (cid:109) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin ) , and actin filament assembly was monitored by increase in pyrene fluorescence ( excitation 365 nm / excitation 407 nm ) . Fluorescence units are arbitrary . ( C ) Electron micrographs of actin assembly reactions containing 5 (cid:109) M yeast actin in the absence or presence of 0 . 5 (cid:109) M Crn1p . Samples were removed from the assembly reactions at 2 min and at steady state ( 30 min ) , fixed in 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , neg - atively stained , and examined by electron microscopy . ( D ) Crn1p causes a concentration - dependent increase in apparent viscosity when coassembled with actin . Variable concentrations of Crn1p ( 0 . 2—1 . 5 (cid:109) M ) were added to monomeric yeast G - actin ( 7 (cid:109) M ) , incubated for 20 min at 25 (cid:56) C , and apparent viscosity was measured by the falling ball assay . ( E ) Crn1p induces barbed - end actin filament assembly . The assembly of 5 (cid:109) M actin ( 4 (cid:109) M yeast actin and 1 (cid:109) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin ) was compared in the presence or absence of 100 nM cytochalasin D , which blocks barbed - end filament assembly , and in the presence or absence of 0 . 5 (cid:109) M Crn1p . Assembly was nucle - ated with preassembled , sheared yeast actin filament seeds ( 0 . 5 (cid:109) M ) . ( F ) Effects of Crn1p ( (cid:68) 600—651 ) on the kinetics of yeast actin fila - ment assembly measured by light scattering assay . The assembly of monomeric yeast actin ( 5 (cid:109) M ) was monitored by light scattering as above in the presence or absence of 0 . 5 (cid:109) M Crn1p ( (cid:68) 600—651 ) , which lacks filament cross - linking activity . ( G ) Effects of Crn1p ( (cid:68) 600— 651 ) on the kinetics of pyrene - actin assembly . Variable concentrations of Crn1p ( (cid:68) 600—651 ; 0 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , or 1 (cid:109) M ) were added to 5 (cid:109) M monomeric actin ( 4 (cid:109) M yeast actin and 1 (cid:109) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin ) , and actin filament assembly was monitored by in - crease in pyrene fluorescence as above . Bar , 200 nm . Goode et al . Regulation of Actin and Microtubule Functions by Yeast Coronin 91 the absence of actin filaments ( Fig . 2 C ) . These results can account for the isolation of a stable Crn1p - actin complex on microtubule affinity columns . Crn1p Promotes the Rapid Barbed - End Assembly of Actin Filaments and Cross - links Filaments into Complex Networks Next , we measured the effects of purified Crn1p on the ki - netics of yeast actin filament assembly using two different assays , light scattering and pyrene - actin fluorescence . The pyrene - actin assay can be more reliable than light scatter - ing assays because the signal is directly proportional to polymer level , whereas light scattering levels are influ - enced by filament lengths and bundling . However , the light scattering assay had an advantage because 100 % un - modified yeast actin was used , whereas the pyrene - actin assay uses a mixture of yeast actin and pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin . In both assays , actin alone exhibited a lag phase of assembly , followed by polymerization that reached steady state by 20 min ( Fig . 4 , A and B , curve A ) . The lag phase for actin assembly is attributed to the slow formation of actin dimers and / or trimers required to nu - cleate filament elongation ( Wegner and Engel , 1975 ; Pol - lard , 1990 ) . In both assays , the addition of 0 . 5 (cid:109) M Crn1p to 5 (cid:109) M monomeric actin caused a dramatic increase in the rate of actin filament assembly ( Fig . 4 , A , curve C and B , curve B ) . The reduction in the lag - phase caused by Crn1p suggests that it can nucleate filament assembly and / or accelerate filament elongation . These effects were concentration de - pendent , since the addition of 0 . 1 (cid:109) M Crn1p to 5 (cid:109) M actin caused a more subtle increase in assembly rate ( Fig . 4 A , curve B ) than did the addition of 0 . 5 (cid:109) M Crn1p ( curve C ) . The increased light scattering at steady state caused by Crn1p ( Fig . 4 A , curve C ) is expected due to the cross - link - ing of actin filaments . Minimal cross - linking appeared to occur at Crn1p concentrations of 0 . 1 (cid:109) M ( Fig . 4 A , curve B ) , consistent with the minimal effects on apparent viscos - ity at similar ratios of Crn1p to actin ( Fig . 3 B ) . Pelleting assays showed that (cid:46) 95 % of actin in all of the reactions shown in Fig . 4 , A and B was polymerized at steady state ( see Materials and Methods ) , indicating that Crn1p did not appreciably increase polymer mass at steady state . Re - actions containing Crn1p reached a higher final level of pyrene fluorescence at steady state . Because polymer mass was not affected by Crn1p , it is likely that the increased pyrene signal at steady state is either due to Crn1p - induced bundling of filaments or Crn1p binding to filaments , which might change the local environment of the pyrene . 1 (cid:109) M Sac6p / fimbrin caused a similar increase in final pyrene - actin fluorescence level without an appreciable increase in poly - mer mass ( not shown ) . We also examined by electron microscopy samples from actin assembly reactions at an early ( 2 min ) time point ( Fig . 4 C ) . No filaments were visible in reactions containing 5 (cid:109) M yeast actin alone at 2 min , consistent with the lag phase for assembly . In contrast , numerous short filaments The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 144 , 1999 92 that appeared bundled were visible in the reactions con - taining 0 . 5 (cid:109) M Crn1p and 5 (cid:109) M yeast actin . This result strongly supports the conclusion that Crn1p promotes rapid actin filament assembly . Interestingly , branching of the short filaments was evident by the 2 - min time - point of assembly ; this could be an important aspect of how coro - nin influences the formation of actin structures in vivo . Ex - amination of the same reactions at steady state ( 30 min ) revealed branched networks of bundled and cross - linked short filaments . The appearance of these actin networks contrasted markedly with the appearance of preassembled actin filaments to which Crn1p is added ( Fig . 3 D ) . This observed difference prompted us to measure the effects of Crn1p on apparent viscosity in coassembly reactions . As shown in Fig . 4 D , Crn1p caused a concentration - depen - dent increase in viscosity , consistent with the formation of the branched filament networks visualized by electron mi - croscopy . The effect is opposite to that observed when Crn1p was added to preassembled actin filaments , which led to a concentration - dependent decrease in viscosity ( Fig . 3 B ) . Thus , Crn1p has the capacity to form either smooth bundles of long actin filaments or networks of branched and bundled short filaments , with decreased or increased apparent viscosity , respectively . To determine from which end of the filament Crn1p - induced actin assembly occurs , we measured pyrene - actin assembly in the presence and absence of 100 nM cyto - chalasin D . At this concentration , cytochalasin D blocks barbed - end assembly , limiting polymerization to pointed ends ( Cooper , 1987 ) . We monitored the assembly of 5 (cid:109) M actin ( 4 (cid:109) M yeast actin and 1 (cid:109) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin ) in the presence or absence of 100 nM Cy - tochalasin D and the presence or absence of 0 . 5 (cid:109) M Crn1p . Assembly was nucleated by the addition of 0 . 5 (cid:109) M preassembled , sheared yeast actin filament seeds . As shown in Fig . 4 E , the addition of cytochalasin D to the re - actions led to a similar decrease in the rate of actin poly - merization with and without Crn1p . This shows that Crn1p induces barbed end assembly of actin filaments . Next , we tested the effects on actin assembly of a trun - cated Crn1p ( Crn1p (cid:68) 600—651 ) that binds to actin fila - ments but lacks cross - linking activity ( see Figs . 3 A and 6 ) . Crn1p (cid:68) 600—651 increased the rate of actin assembly in both light scattering ( Fig . 4 F ) and pyrene - actin assembly assays ( Fig . 4 G ) , significantly reducing the lag phase of ac - tin assembly . This demonstrates that assembly - promoting activity is independent of cross - linking activity . Crn1p Does Not Stabilize Actin Filaments or Change the Steady State Actin Critical Concentration To test whether Crn1p has any effects on filament stabil - ity , we first measured the effect of Crn1p on the critical concentration for actin assembly ( actin Cc ) . Actin Cc is defined as the concentration of actin above which it as - sembles into polymer . In sedimentation assays , this corre - sponds to the concentration of actin in the supernatant af - ter high speed centrifugation . As shown in Fig . 5 A , Crn1p caused no significant change in actin Cc at molar ratios of 1 : 10 and 1 : 3 Crn1p to actin . There was a small increase in the actin Cc ( less than twofold ) at 1 : 1 molar ratios . How - ever , this effect may not be relevant in vivo since Crn1p is present in yeast at a molar ratio of 1 Crn1p per 10 actin subunits . To measure the effects of Crn1p on filament stability , we assayed the disassembly of preassembled pyrene - actin filaments mixed with 0 . 5 or 1 (cid:109) M Crn1p , 1 (cid:109) M Sac6p ( a known F - actin stabilizing protein ) or 100 nM cytochalasin D , which blocks barbed ends . The filaments were then mixed with 40 (cid:109) M latrunculin A ( an actin monomer - seques - tering agent ) and filament disassembly was monitored by pyrene fluorescence . As shown in Fig . 5 B , fimbrin / Sac6p ( curve D ) and cytochalasin D ( curve E ) stabilized fila - ments , reducing their rates of depolymerization , but Crn1p did not affect the rate of filament depolymerization ( curves B and C ) . Crn1p Activities are Mediated by Distinct Domains To further dissect Crn1p function , we expressed fragments Figure 5 . Crn1p has no significant effects on actin critical concen - tration ( actin Cc ) at steady state or the rate of actin filament de - polymerization . ( A ) Crn1p does not affect significantly the actin Cc at steady state . Three different concentrations of preassem - bled yeast actin filaments ( 0 . 5 , 1 , or 2 (cid:109) M ) were mixed with four different molar ratios of Crn1p to actin ( 0 , 1 : 10 , 1 : 3 , 1 : 1 ) , incu - bated for 20 min , and the actin filaments in the reactions were pelleted by high speed centrifugation . Levels of unpolymerized actin ( actin in the supernatant ) were compared by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . ( B ) Crn1p does not affect the rate of ac - tin filament depolymerization . 5 (cid:109) M preassembled F - actin ( 4 (cid:109) M yeast actin and 1 (cid:109) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin ) was added to 0 . 5 (cid:109) M Crn1p , 1 (cid:109) M Crn1p , 1 (cid:109) M Sac6p / fimbrin , or 100 nM cytochalasin D . After incubation for 15 min at 25 (cid:56) C , fila - ment disassembly was induced by the addition of 40 (cid:109) M latrun - culin A at time 0 , and depolymerization was monitored by change in pyrene fluorescence as described in Fig . 4 b . Goode et al . Regulation of Actin and Microtubule Functions by Yeast Coronin 93 of Crn1p ( amino acids 1—600 , 1—400 , and 400—651 ) in E . coli and purified each fragment as described above for full - length Crn1p ( Fig . 6 A ) . Each fragment was tested in vitro for its ability to ( a ) cosediment with microtubules , ( b ) cosediment with actin filaments , ( c ) promote actin fila - ment assembly by light scattering assay and ( d ) bundle actin filaments by low speed pelleting assays and elec - tron microscopy . The results are summarized in Fig . 6 B . Two fragments missing COOH - terminal sequences , Crn1p ( (cid:68) 400—651 ) and Crn1p ( (cid:68) 600—651 ) , the later consisting of only the WD - repeat region , demonstrated F - actin binding and assembly - promoting activities . The COOH terminus ( 400—651 ) , which contains the MAP1B - homologous re - gion , is both required and sufficient for microtubule bind - ing . The COOH - terminal coiled - coil region ( 600—651 ) is required for actin bundling . This result suggests that actin filament cross - linking may depend on coiled coil mediated Crn1p dimerization . Crn1p Localizes to the Yeast Cortical Actin Cytoskeleton In Vivo Crn1p localization in wild - type yeast cells was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti - Crn1p anti - bodies ( Fig . 7 ) . Crn1p localized to punctate structures at the cell cortex throughout the cell cycle , and staining was absent in crn1 (cid:68) cells . Double label immunofluorescence microscopy with anti - actin antibodies showed that these punctate structures correspond to cortical actin patches . Furthermore , direct fluorescence microscopy of cells ex - pressing a GFP - Crn1p fusion protein showed a similar lo - calization pattern ( not shown ) and the GFP - Crn1p stain - ing patches were motile . The motility of cortical actin patches in S . cerevisiae has been established previously ( Doyle and Botstein , 1996 ; Waddle et al . , 1996 ) , and the variable motility rates of the GFP - Crn1p staining patches were similar to those observed for actin patches . Addition of latrunculin A to cells caused the rapid disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton and concomitant translocation of Crn1p staining to the cytoplasm ( not shown ) . Double label immunofluorescence microscopy showed that Crn1p local - ization to cortical actin patches is unaffected by a number of mutations in genes encoding actin cytoskeleton pro - teins , including abp1 (cid:68) , aip1 (cid:68) , cap2 (cid:68) , cof1 - 22 , pfy1 - 116 , sac6 (cid:68) , srv2 (cid:68) , rvs161 (cid:68) , rvs167 (cid:68) , sla1 (cid:68) , sla2 (cid:68) , and tpm1 (cid:68) ( not shown ) . Synthetic Defects in Actin Organization Between a CRN1 Gene Disruption Mutation and Mutations that Reduce Actin Filament Turnover Rates Deletion of the CRN1 gene resulted in no obvious defects in cell morphology or growth rate at 16 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 34 , and 37 (cid:56) C . Moreover , crn1 (cid:68) cells grew indistinguishably from wild - type cells on medium supplemented with 1 M NaCl , 1 M KCl , 0 . 1 M MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 M CaCl 2 , 1 M sorbitol , or 3 % formamide , and exhibited normal fluid phase endocytosis , Figure 6 .

Figure 7 . Localization of Crn1p in yeast cells . Actin and Crn1p localization in wild - type ( DDY1088 ) and crn1 (cid:68) ( DDY1521 ) strains was examined by double - label immunofluorescence mi - croscopy using Crn1p and actin antibodies . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 144 , 1999 94 as monitored by uptake of lucifer yellow dye . The actin cy - toskeletons of crn1 (cid:68) cells also appeared normal when ex - amined by actin immunofluorescence ( Fig . 7 ) . Given the high affinity of Crn1p for actin filaments in vitro and its dramatic effects on actin assembly , the absence of a de - tectable defect in actin organization or cell growth in crn1 (cid:68) cells suggested there may be proteins in yeast whose functions are redundant with Crn1p function . To test this possibility , we crossed crn1 (cid:68) strains to strains with mutations in genes encoding other actin - asso - ciated proteins ( abp1 (cid:68) , aip1 (cid:68) , cap2 (cid:68) , cof1 - 22 , las17 (cid:68) , pca1 (cid:68) , pfy1 - 116 , sac6 (cid:68) , rvs167 (cid:68) , tpm1 (cid:68) , and twf1 (cid:68) ) . Hap - loid progeny from crosses were compared for growth at 16 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 34 , and 37 (cid:56) C , and examined by rhodamine phal - loidin staining for defects in actin cytoskeleton organiza - tion . Only one mutant , cof1 - 22 , showed synthetic defects in combination with crn1 (cid:68) . cof1 - 22 is an allele of the cofi - lin gene that results in a partial defect in actin filament de - polymerization / severing , resulting in slower turnover of actin filaments ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . At 25 (cid:56) C , cof1 - 22 cells have normal morphologies , show a partial de - polarization of their cortical actin patches ( (cid:122) 25 % of cells ) , and their actin patches appear somewhat brighter than patches in wild - type cells ( Fig . 8 A ) . cof1 - 22 crn1 (cid:68) double mutant cells grew more slowly than cof1 - 22 cells and were generally larger and more rounded . In addition , many of the double mutant cells accumulated a large mass of fila - mentous actin near the bud neck ( Fig . 8 A , arrows ) . Some cells also had multiple buds , elongated necks , and / or ab - normal protrusions of actin staining ( Fig . 8 A , arrows ) . The crn1 (cid:68) cof1 - 22 genetic interaction prompted us to test for interactions between crn1 (cid:68) and act1 - 159 , a muta - tion that resides in the ATP binding pocket of actin . The act1 - 159 mutation shows genetic interactions with cof1 - 22 and reduces the turnover of actin filaments ( Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ) . At 25 (cid:56) C , act1 - 159 cells grow more slowly than wild - type cells , they show partially delocalized corti - cal actin patch staining , and have somewhat brighter actin Figure 8 . Synthetic defects in actin or - ganization in crn1 (cid:68) cof1 - 22 and crn1 (cid:68) act1 - 159 cells . Haploid segregants from crn1 (cid:68) (cid:51) cof1 - 22 and crn1 (cid:68) (cid:51) act1 - 159 genetic crosses were grown to log phase at 20 (cid:56) C , and actin organization was examined by rhodamine phalloidin staining . crn1 (cid:68) cells and wild - type cells had normal actin staining ( not shown ) . Actin staining is shown for cof1 - 22 and cof1 - 22 crn1 (cid:68) cells ( A ) and for act1 - 159 and act1 - 159 crn1 (cid:68) cells ( B ) . Ar - rows mark defects in actin organization specific to the double mutants . Goode et al . Regulation of Actin and Microtubule Functions by Yeast Coronin 95 patch and cable staining than wild - type cells ( Fig . 8 B ) . act1 - 159 crn1 (cid:68) double mutant cells grow more slowly than act1 - 159 cells and show severe defects in actin organiza - tion . The majority of act1 - 159 crn1 (cid:68) cells show a reduction in actin staining intensity of their cortical actin patches , and many cells accumulate a large filamentous actin mass near their bud necks ( Fig . 8 B , arrows ) . Defects in crn1 (cid:68) Cells Suggest a Microtubule Function for Crn1p Examination of microtubule staining in crn1 (cid:68) cells by im - munofluorescence revealed defects in cytoplasmic micro - tubule orientation and length ( Fig . 9 ) . Approximately 5 % of the medium - to large - budded crn1 (cid:68) cells showed un - usually long and misoriented cytoplasmic microtubules that extended from the SPB in the bud back towards or through the neck into the mother cell . This result is quite dramatic since similar defects were never seen in wild - type cells ( n (cid:46) 1 , 000 cells ) . Overexpression of GST - Crn1p Causes an Arrest of Cell Growth and Severe Defects in Actin and Microtubule Organization To test the effects of overexpression of Crn1p , a GST - Crn1p fusion protein was expressed in wild - type yeast ( DDY130 ) on a high copy plasmid under the regulation of the GAL10 promoter . Cells expressing GST alone showed normal morphologies and normal microtubule and actin organization . However , overproduction of GST - Crn1p led to an arrest of cell growth and to dramatic changes in cell morphology . Approximately 50 % of the cells became ex - tremely large and rounded , and almost every cell , normal in size or enlarged , showed severe defects in actin and mi - crotubule organization as shown by double label immu - nofluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 10 ) . In these cells , the cortical actin patches were depolarized , actin cables were not visible , and the majority of cells contained a single ab - normal actin bar - like structure located in or near the nucleus . Intriguingly , these abnormal structures often appeared to be coincident with or proximal to tubulin bar - like structures . These cell populations also showed a striking absence of medium or long spindles , raising the possibility that the ac - tivities of Crn1p at the cortical actin cytoskeleton help to regulate spindle elongation . Discussion Coronin Promotes the Rapid Assembly and Cross - linking of Actin Filaments Coronin is a highly conserved actin - associated protein that localizes to sites of dynamic actin assembly in D . discoi - deum and to the actin tails of Listeria in infected mamma - lian cells ( see Introduction ) . However , until now , no activ - ities other than actin binding had been demonstrated for coronin . Here , we have identified an S . cerevisiae homo - logue of coronin , Crn1p , and have shown that it ( a ) local - izes to the yeast cortical actin cytoskeleton , ( b ) binds to actin filaments with high affinity ( K d (cid:122) 6 nM ) , and ( c ) pro - motes the rapid barbed end assembly and cross - linking of actin filaments . These two activities ( assembly - stimulation and cross - linking ) are mediated by distinct domains in Crn1p . Because both domains are highly conserved , these activities are likely to be conserved in all members of the coronin family . We have shown that actin filament cross - linking de - pends on the coiled - coil domain of Crn1p , suggesting a re - quirement for Crn1p dimerization . This model is sup - ported further by the coimmunoprecipitation of native coronin from yeast extracts with an epitope - tagged Crn1p expressed in these cells ( B . L . Goode , D . G . Drubin , and G . Barnes , unpublished results ) . Crn1p is capable of cross - linking actin filaments in vitro into branched networks or smooth bundles of filaments , depending on whether Crn1p is present during the assembly of actin , or is added after actin assembly , respectively . One implication of this analy - sis is that coronin could organize actin filaments into dif - ferent higher order structures depending on cellular condi - tions or signals . Coronin Promotes the Rapid Barbed - End Assembly of Actin Filaments by a Novel Mechanism Crn1p significantly reduces the lag phase for actin filament assembly . This activity is independent of coronin(cid:213)s fila - ment cross - linking activity , since Crn1p ( (cid:68) 600—651 ) has full assembly activity , but does not cross - link filaments . Figure 9 . Deletion of the CRN1 gene causes pro - nounced defects in cytoplas - mic microtubules at a low frequency . Wild - type ( DDY - 1519 ) and crn1 (cid:68) ( DDY1518 ) cells were grown at 20 (cid:56) C to OD 600 (cid:53) 0 . 5 and examined by immunofluorescence mi - croscopy using tubulin anti - bodies . Approximately 5 % of the medium to large bud - ded crn1 (cid:68) cells had abnor - mally long cytoplasmic mi - crotubules ( marked by arrows ) that emanate from the microtubule organizing center in the bud and extend back towards or through the bud neck into the mother cell . Similar defects were never seen in the wild - type cells ( n (cid:46) 1 , 000 cells ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 144 , 1999 96 Further , we have shown that a different actin filament bundling protein ( yeast fimbrin / Sac6p ) has no effect on ac - tin assembly ( Goode , B . L . , D . G . Drubin , and G . Barnes , unpublished data ) . Thus , the effects of coronin on actin as - sembly are specific and unrelated to cross - linking . The assembly lag phase has been attributed to the slow and reversible formation of actin dimers and / or trimers ( Wegner and Engel , 1975 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ) . Crn1p might reduce the lag phase for assembly by increas - ing the rate of formation of dimers / trimers and / or free ends of filaments available for polymerization . An in - crease in available filament ends can be accomplished in vitro by severing of filaments , capping of filament ends to stabilize dimer / trimer formation , or binding to the sides of dimers / trimers to stabilize their formation . Our data argue strongly against a filament severing or capping mechanism for Crn1p . Severing proteins , including the gelsolin / villin / severin family and the ADF / cofilin family ( reviewed in Hartwig and Kwiatkowski , 1991 ; Carlier , 1998 ) , increase the rate of filament depolymerization , and when added to preassembled actin filaments , sever and / or depolymerize filaments to reduce the average length of filaments . In contrast , coronin has no detectable effects on the rate of filament depolymerization , and shows no indication of severing and / or inducing depolymerization when it is added to preassembled filaments . Coronin also does not have properties of a capping pro - tein . Barbed end capping proteins increase the actin criti - cal concentration and reduce the rate of filament depoly - merization , and do so at low stoichiometries of capping protein to actin ( Schafer et al . , 1996 ) . Pointed end capping proteins , such as the Arp2 / 3 complex , also dramatically re - duce the rate of depolymerization of filaments at low stoi - chiometries ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . In contrast , coronin has no significant effect on the actin critical concentration or the rate of depolymerization of filaments . Barbed - end capping proteins also reduce the rate of filament elonga - tion , since they limit polymerization to the pointed ends . However , Crn1p - induced filament assembly is rapid and occurs by addition of actin subunits at the barbed ends of filaments . These data argue strongly against coronin hav - ing capping and / or severing activities . Thus , if coronin does increase the number of free ends available for poly - merization , it likely does so by stabilization of actin di - mers / trimers via interactions with their sides . An alternate , but not mutually exclusive mechanism to explain the reduction in assembly lag phase by coronin is that it increases the rate of actin filament elongation . The rates of actin polymerization observed in neutrophil cell extracts suggest that there may be cellular factors that ac - celerate actin filament elongation ( Zigmond , 1998 ; Zig - mond et al . , 1998 ) . However , until now , no protein pos - sessing the appropriate biochemical activities to mediate this effect has been isolated . Although the Arp2 / 3 complex mixed with the ActA protein from Listeria monocytogenes promotes extremely rapid actin filament assembly in vitro ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) , it is not yet clear whether these effects are due to nucleation and / or increased rates of elongation . We speculate that Crn1p acts by binding to the sides of and stabilizing actin dimers / trimers , and / or accelerating filament elongation . That coronin binds to the sides of ac - tin filaments is supported by the 1 : 1 saturation stoichiome - try of coronin binding to actin and by mapping of the coro - nin binding site on actin ( Goode , B . L . , and D . G . Drubin , Figure 10 . Overexpression of GST - Crn1p causes severe defects in cell growth and microtubule and actin organi - zation . Wild - type cells ( DDY - 130 ) carrying the pEGKT - CRN1 plasmid were grown to log phase at 25 (cid:56) C in mini - mal selective medium ( lack - ing uracil and leucine ) with glucose . Cells were washed and transferred to minimal selective medium with 2 % raffinose for 12 h of growth at 25 (cid:56) C . Then 2 % galactose was added to induce the ex - pression of GST - Crn1p . Af - ter 4 h growth at 25 (cid:56) C , the cells were examined by dou - ble label immunofluores - cence microscopy using actin and tubulin antibodies . Bar , 10 (cid:109) M . Goode et al . Regulation of Actin and Microtubule Functions by Yeast Coronin 97 unpublished data ) . It is less clear how coronin might in - crease the rate of filament elongation . Genetic Analyses Are Consistent with a Role for Crn1p in Regulating the Assembly and Turnover of the Cortical Actin Cytoskeleton Although Crn1p has potent activities on actin in vitro , de - letion of the CRN1 gene causes no detectable defects in actin organization , endocytosis , or cell growth . The lack of a readily detectable null phenotype in cells could be ex - plained if Crn1p function is redundant with other proteins in yeast . This is not uncommon for yeast actin - associated proteins ( e . g . , Abp1p , Aip1p , Myo3p , Myo4p , Myo5p , and Twf1p ) . However , the crn1 (cid:68) mutation showed no obvious synthetic defects in combination with mutations in ABP1 , AIP1 , CAP2 , LAS17 , PFY1 , PCA1 , SAC6 , RVS167 , or TWF1 , suggesting that CRN1 may have functions distinct from those mediated by these genes . Specific genetic interactions were observed between a crn1 (cid:68) mutation and the cof1 - 22 ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) and act1 - 159 ( Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ) muta - tions . Given that cofilin promotes the rapid disassembly of actin filaments at their pointed ends ( Carlier , 1998 ) and that coronin promotes the rapid assembly of actin fila - ments at their barbed ends , we speculate that the genetic interaction between coronin and cofilin may result from a loss of complementary activities directed at opposite ends of the filament . The combination of reduced assembly - promoting activity and reduced filament disassembly ( and therefore , a reduced actin monomer pool ) may impair the capacity to form new filaments . Similarly , this might ex - plain the genetic interaction between the crn1 (cid:68) and act1 - 159 mutations , since act1 - 159 also reduces the rate of actin filament disassembly and turnover in vivo ( Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ) . The activities that we have demonstrated for coronin also raise the possibility of a functional interaction be - tween coronin and the Arp2 / 3 complex and / or WASP , two key regulators of actin assembly ( Symons et al . , 1996 ; Welch et al . , 1997 , 1998 ; Mullins et al . , 1998 ; reviewed in Zigmond , 1998 ) . The defects in actin organization in cof1 - 22 crn1 (cid:68) and act1 - 159 crn1 (cid:68) cells ( accumulation of a large mass of actin near the bud neck ) are similar to those in mutants of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( arp3 - 2 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) and mutants of the yeast WASP homologue , LAS17 / BEE1 ( Li , 1997 ; M . Duncan and D . G . Drubin , unpub - lished results ) . Further , coronin copurifies with the Arp2 / 3 complex from neutrophil extracts ( Machesky et al . , 1997 ) , suggesting a possible direct interaction . Crn1p May Help Link the Actin and Microtubule Cytoskeletons in Yeast Several observations lead us to consider that yeast coronin may have an additional role in linking functions of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in yeast . First , the unique region of Crn1p shares sequence homology with the microtubule binding region of MAP1B and is required for microtubule binding by Crn1p . Second , in the presence of actin filaments , the microtubule binding affinity of Crn1p is enhanced markedly . Despite the low penetrance of the microtubule phenotype , the defects are distinct and specific ; similar defects are never observed in wild - type cells . In addition , a different microtubule defect ( increase in the number of large - budded cells with short spindles ) recently was reported for coronin null mutants ( H . - Chap - delaine et al . , 1998 ) . To our knowledge , coronin is the first yeast actin binding protein that , when mutated , gives rise to microtubule defects . Coronin also is the first yeast actin binding protein that results in microtubule defects when overexpressed ( loss of medium and long spindles and for - mation of aberrant tubulin - staining structures ) . Taken to - gether , these biochemical and genetic observations suggest a microtubule function for Crn1p , possibly in attaching cy - toplasmic microtubules to cortical actin patches during spindle elongation and nuclear migration . The mild phe - notype in the coronin null mutant cells suggests that other factors must be involved in coronin functions , which we will attempt to identify in the future .
