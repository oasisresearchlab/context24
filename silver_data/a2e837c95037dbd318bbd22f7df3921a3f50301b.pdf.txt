Hyman 1 Coordination of multiple kinesin and myosin motors is required for intracellular transport , cell motility and mitosis . However , comprehensive resources that allow systems analysis of the localization and interplay between motors in living cells do not exist . Here , we generated a library of 243 amino - and carboxy - terminally tagged mouse and human bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome transgenes to establish 227 stably transfected HeLa cell lines , 15 mouse embryonic stem cell lines and 1 transgenic mouse line . The cells were characterized by expression and localization analyses and further investigated by afﬁnity - puriﬁcation mass spectrometry , identifying 191 candidate protein – protein interactions . We illustrate the power of this resource in two ways . First , by characterizing a network of interactions that targets CEP170 to centrosomes , and second , by showing that kinesin light - chain heterodimers bind conventional kinesin in cells . Our work provides a set of validated resources and candidate molecular pathways to investigate motor protein function across cell lineages . Actin and microtubules define polarized and dynamic cytoskeletal networks required for cell integrity , intracellular transport and faithful cell division . An important class of proteins that works together with these polymer systems is the structurally related , P - loop motor protein superfamily 1 . The human genome contains 39 myosin and 44 kinesin genes but the exact number varies widely across eukaryotes 2 , 3 . Gene targeting in vivo 4 – 6 , RNA - mediated interference ( RNAi ) analysis 7 – 9 and biochemical approaches 10 – 12 have provided insights into the generic functional roles for a number of motors . However , at present , there is no resource available that allows a comprehensive analysis of motor function in a given cell type or to trace the changes of a motor - specific activity across cell - fate transitions . Bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) transgenes provide an ideal platform for high - throughput analysis of gene function in cultured cells and in vivo 13 , 14 . This is because BACs contain the gene together with many cis - regulatory sequences required for native control of gene expression , the production of relevant isoforms and proper translational control through the cell cycle . Targeted recombination in Escherichia coli can be used to insert tagging cassettes or substitute nucleotide residues in its genomic context 15 , 16 .

Indeed , these methods have successfully generated resources to study the interplay between mitotic genes 13 , to characterize all components of a cellular organelle ( the centrosome ) 18 , to generate a genome - wide histone methylation map 19 and to perform targeted studies of individual proteins 15 , 20 , 21 . Here , we generate a transgeneOmics resource for motor proteins to investigate 71 of the 82 annotated human kinesin and myosin genes . Stable transfection of BACs generated 227 HeLa cell and 15 mouse embryonic stem cell ( mESC ) lines . To further show that this resource is readily adaptable to in vivo experiments , we established a transgenic mouse line expressing recombinant human KIF23 . We report localization patterns for previously uncharacterized motor proteins in HeLa cells and define candidate protein – protein interactions identified by systematic affinity - purification mass spectrometry ( AP – MS ) from transgenic HeLa cell lysates . We illustrate the use of our resource with two discoveries : a mechanism that regulates centrosome composition and a previously unknown light - chain organization in conventional kinesin .

( c ) A summary of HeLa BAC lines generated in this report superposed over a phylogenetic representation of human kinesin and myosin motors annotated with standardized motor class and gene names , as adapted from refs 2 , 3 . Genes normally expressed in HeLa cells are indicated with cyan ( see Supplementary Table S1 ) . For all combinations of N - and C - terminal tagging of human ( h ) - or mouse ( m ) - derived BACs , green indicates that a stably transfected HeLa BAC line is available ( see Supplementary Table S2 ) . RESULTS Microarray analysis of motor gene expression in cells We wanted to determine which motors are expressed in HeLa cells , and how this expression pattern varies between different cell types . To address this challenge , we performed a single - platform transcription profiling analysis in HeLa cells , a human cell line used for high - throughput BAC transfection 14 , and primary human immune cells before and after stimulation . We find that HeLa cells express more motor genes than either primary CD4 + T - lymphocytes or monocytes . Ex vivo T - cell activation increases the number of expressed motor genes to approximately that of HeLa cells , but we find fewer genes activated by monocyte differentiation ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Table S1 ) . A comparison of HeLa cells to resting immunocytes identified a core set of 21 ubiquitously expressed human motors and another 32 expressed in at least one cell type ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Table S1 ) . We enumerate the motor proteins endogenous to HeLa cells and highlight differencesinmotorgeneexpressionbetweenprimaryhumancells . Generating a motor BAC transgene and cell line collection To generate a comprehensive transgene resource to study motor function in cells , C - terminal LAP or N - terminal NFLAP tags were introduced into all commercially available BAC transgenes encoding motor proteins to provide uniform tags for immunofluorescence microscopy ( IFM ) , live - cell video microscopy and AP – MS ( ref . 14 ) . Murine and human genes were tagged as complementary gene sets with a nearly identical gene number for use as fluorescent transgenes or heterologous RNAi - resistance rescue factors 15 , 17 , depending on the species origin of the cultured cell line , or to study motor function in vivo inmice . ABACcollectionincluding59full - lengthhumanand72mouse motor genes was tagged by high - throughput recombination in E . coli ( see Supplementary Table S2 ) , transfected into HeLa cells and selected for stable incorporation of the transgene , as described previously 14 . The 86 % overall success rate produced 227 cell lines ( Fig . 1c ) that we characterized by IFM and western blotting of cell lysates ( see Supplementary Table S3 ) . In most cases , the cells represent transformed pools , but we also prepared GFP - positive cell pools and clones by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) for genes of interest , ( see Supplementary Table S3 ) and found levels of the recombinant human transgenes similar to the endogenous protein ( see Supplementary Fig . S1 ) , as previously noted for other BAC transgenes 15 , 20 . BAC transgene localization in cultured cells We confirmed known mitotic localizations of motor proteins ( see Supplementary Table S2 ) and performed an interphase localization 326 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2013 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

As predicted from previous work , many kinesin and myosin transgenes are targeted to recognizable interphase compartments that reflect a cellular function ( Fig . 2a ) . We also observed that regulation of protein abundance through the cell cycle for human ( see Supplementary Video S1 ) and mouse ( see Supplementary Video S2 ) motor proteins was similar in HeLa cells , as expected from previous reports of cross - species BAC transgene function 13 , 15 , 17 . As we had generated both N - and C - terminally tagged human - and mouse - derived transgenes , this allowed us to compare the localization of transgenes tagged at different ends as an indirect functional readout . We found that 15 ( 67 % ) of 23 previously characterized kinesins and myosins localize properly as either the N - or C - terminally tagged recombinant motor protein . Another 6 motors are properly localized when tagged at only one end ( Fig . 2b ) regardless of whether the mouse - or human - derived gene was used . This illustrates that the choice of tagging site is important for function , as previously shown in yeast 22 . A subset of BACs was also transfected into mESCs to compare localization of the resulting protein with that observed in HeLa cells . IFM analysis in fixed cells revealed motor transgene localization to be broadly similar in HeLa cells and mESCs ( see Supplementary Figs S2A , B and Table S3 ) . Analysis of live cells with tagged Kinesin - 2 , a heterodimeric complex of KIF3A and KIF3C , also showed targeting to dynamiccellextensions , asexpected 23 , inHeLacells ( seeSupplementary Fig . S2C and Supplementary Video S3 ) and mESCs ( see Supplementary Video S4 ) . Our analysis indicates which tagged motor BAC transgenes are properly localized in cells and may function across species .

( a ) Idealized comparison of KIF23 localization ( green ) relative to DNA ( blue ) and the apical membrane ( red ) in suspension and polarized epithelial cells , as adapted from ref . 29 . Schematic images , left to right , represent interphase , metaphase , anaphase ( suspension cell , top ) or cytokinesis ( epithelial cell , bottom ) and post - abscission . KIF23 is nuclear during interphase and cytoplasmic through early mitosis . From anaphase to cytokinesis it is concentrated at spindle midzone ﬁbres , then midbodies . In epithelial cells , the cytokinesis proceeds from the basolateral to apical side and midbodies accumulate at the apical membrane . ( b ) Neuro2a cells ﬁxed before ( left ) or after ( right ) differentiation with retinoic acid and stained for α - tubulin ( red ) , GFP ( green ) and DNA ( blue ) . In cycling Neuro2a cells , KIF23 – EGFP is targeted to the spindle midzone and a residual midbody during cytokinesis . For Neuro2a cells differentiated with retinoic acid , an image of a representative neurite ( arrow ) , and enlarged ( 2 × ) images ( composite and individual GFP and α - tubulin channels ) are shown . ( c ) Left , confocal section of the mouse embryonic neuroepithelium at embryonic day 14 . 5 ( mid - neurogenesis ) stained for DNA ( blue ) and ﬁlamentous actin ( red ) in KIF23 – EGFP transgenic mice .

Right , a magniﬁed view of a cell undergoing cytokinesis with GFP staining midzone ﬁbres between the basally - to - apically ingressing cleavage furrow and the apical surface of the cell . Scale bars , 10 µ M . KIF23 localization in multiple cell types BACs include native regulatory information , often conserved across species 24 , making them ideal for use in transgenic animals to characterize protein function in vivo . To illustrate this potential , we investigated the localization of recombinant human KIF23 in mouse cells and tissues . Of the kinesins required for cell division , some also have demonstrated interphase roles 25 , 26 . In human cells , KIF23 is required in the terminal stages of mitosis 27 and neurite outgrowth in post - mitotic neurons 28 . KIF23 labels the anaphase midzone and midbodies between cytokinesis and abscission ( Fig . 3a and ref . 27 ) , but its localization in neurites or native tissues is thus far undocumented by IFM . In light of the published requirement for KIF23 in neurite outgrowth , we chose to investigate KIF23 localization in Neuro2a cells , a mouse neuroblastoma cell line that exits the cell cycle on treatment with retinoic acid to generate neurite processes . KIF23 was targeted to mitotic structures in untreated cells , as previously described , and identical to the pattern observed in HeLa cells and mESCs ( ref . 29 ) . In cells treated with retinoic acid , we found KIF23 targeted at the tips of cellular processes ( Fig . 3b ) , consistent with a primarily mitotic motor localized in a functional interphase compartment . To analyse KIF23 in tissues , we established a transgenic mouse line by pronuclear injection ( see Supplementary Fig . S3a ) and analysed a panel of tissues from the resulting animals by thin - section IFM . KIF23 was undetectable in representative non - proliferating tissues such as liver , kidney and absorptive intestinal epithelia ( see Supplementary Figs S3B – D , respectively ) , suggesting that not all tissues have a post - mitotic role for KIF23 . Bright midbodies , in contrast , decorated the epithelial surfaces of proliferative zones such as the embryonic brain ( Fig . 3c ) and intestinal crypt ( see Supplementary Figs S3E , F ) . These same regions contained anaphase cells with spindle midzone staining ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . S3G , respectively ) , showing that the in vivo distribution of KIF23 recapitulates previous work in cultured cells 29 . The absence of midbodies outside intestinal crypts ( see Supplementary Fig . S3D ) further indicates that midbodies persist in zones of cell proliferation and are lost as cells differentiate . Our results demonstrate that the same human - derived BAC transgene is readily portable to model cells and organisms . Interaction screening for motor - speciﬁc binding proteins Protein interaction analysis is a targeted approach to infer protein function but there are relatively few known motor binding proteins . Therefore , a central goal of this project was to prove the significance of motor BACs for systematic interaction analysis . To this end , 63 HeLa BAC pools were analysed by AP – MS . To test the efficiency of recovering bait protein , clarified extracts from cycling and mitotically enriched cells were submitted for AP – MS . Overall , we recovered 61 ( 95 % ) of our transgenes from a total of 189 ( 87 % ) individual AP – MS experiments ( see Supplementary Fig . S4A and Table S4 ) . Label - free relative quantification of GFP - derived peptides ( see Supplementary Fig . S4B ) demonstrated a broad dynamic range for the recovery of motor transgenes from different samples ( see Supplementary Fig . S4C ) , often successfully identifying proteins undetectable by western blotting . AP – MS detected the expected transgene product in 189 samples , establishing a threshold for samples that can reveal interactions . Background subtraction against promiscuous binding proteins 30 – 32 identified 222 high - confidence interactions , including 45 ( 20 % ) that were previously characterized or had homologous interactions . Another 62 ( 28 % ) interactions are consistent with similar patterns of subcellular localization for the two proteins . Finally , genetic interactions support an extra 21 ( 10 % ) interactions ( see Supplementary Table S5 ) . The relatively small number of interactions and the high fraction ( 52 % ) supported by empirical data indicates that our background subtraction yielded high - confidence , high - affinity motor - selective interaction partners . Combined localization and interaction studies have proved a powerful approach to investigate protein function 13 , 18 . Figure 4 superimposes localization data for 22 ( 39 % ) transgenes and all 178 interactors identified by AP – MS . The subset of 86 pairwise interactions that were previously reported , or validated by co - localization , are 328 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2013 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Summary of localization and interaction data for motor - selective interaction partners identiﬁed by AP – MS of myosin and kinesin BAC transgenes , adapted from Supplementary Table S5 . Nodes representing proteins ( shaded grey for motor proteins ) and their subcellular localization ( concentric coloured circles ) are connected by edges that indicate previously reported ( orange ) or candidate ( black ) interactions . Annotated protein complexes are shaded ( grey ) . Myosins , nucleoporins and mitotic kinases are indicated . presented from three perspectives : interactions within a protein superfamily ( motor proteins ) , interactions between two protein superfamilies ( motors and protein kinases ) , and all other interactions that were previously reported or validated by co - localization . In a screen of 56 motor proteins , we found 7 motor – motor interactions , none previously reported . This is consistent with each motor defining a unique subcellular compartment and supports an evolutionary argument for motor protein diversity . These interaction partners , including four reciprocal interactions , are all targeted to mitotic organelles ( Fig . 5a ) . Global and local protein phosphorylation is an important control mechanism for cellular processes . Therefore , we searched for interactions between motors and protein kinases . Among the 518 human protein kinases 33 , 11 kinases and 3 accessory proteins bind 13 motors to define 25 protein – protein interactions . In 16 ( 64 % ) of the motor – kinase interactions , two mitotic proteins were linked . The interactions between KIF11 and TBK1 or KIF4A and casein kinase stand out because two primarily mitotic kinesins bind protein kinases with no clear link in mitosis . The remaining 7 pairwise interactions link non - mitoticproteinstocandidateregulatorymechanisms ( Fig . 5b ) . Figure 5c illustrates localization – interaction maps for 27 previously reported and 16 candidate pairwise interactions , the latter dominated by regulatory light chains . For clarity , 13 interactions linking nuclear localized kinesins to nucleoporins are omitted . Interaction screening of mitosis 13 or autophagy 34 proteins revealed networks consisting of linked multi - protein complexes that defined subnetworks functioning as protein machines .

Instead , motors bind light chains , protein kinases and nucleoporins . This observation suggests that motor proteins are most stably associated with regulatory factors , not their cognate organelles or cargoes . A kinesin network modulates CEP170 targeting to centrosomes The centrosome is the dominant microtubule - organizing centre in cells and is required for polarity , intracellular trafficking and accurate cell division . Although more than 300 centrosome - associated proteins have been identified 18 , 35 , the function and regulation of many centrosome components remains an open question . We identified three centrosome - associated kinesins ( KIF2A , KIF2C , KIFC3 ) that independently bind CEP170 ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Table S5 ) , a PLK1 - associated centrosomal protein with a role in microtubule organization 36 . In fixed cells , RNAi depletion of each kinesin or CEP170 caused no gross spindle defects , consistent with 37 , aside from a small , butsignificantincreaseinmetaphasespindlelength ( seeSupplementary Fig . S5A ) . These results suggest that CEP170 - associated proteins are important for metaphase spindle size control , but are not essential for spindle bipolarity . Next , we investigated the role of these proteins in CEP170 targeting through the cell cycle using a HeLa BAC line as a reporter system ( Fig . 6a ) . Qualitative analysis of fixed mitotic cells indicated that KIFC3 , a known CEP170 binding partner 13 , and KIF2C are individually required for proper CEP170 targeting to metaphase centrosomes ( see Supplementary Fig . S5B ) . This result is consistent with the known dynamic interplay of mitotic centrosome components 18 ; however , we also observed that KIF2A depletion enhanced the number of interphase cells with CEP170 - positive centrosomes ( Fig . 6b ) . To further investigate CEP170 dynamics , we used time - lapse fluorescence microscopy to improve the temporal resolution and quantification of CEP170 transgene fluorescence at centrosomes . Targeting of CEP170 – LAP to centrosomes occurs in two waves , immediately before and after mitosis ( see Supplementary Video S5 ) . The first wave involves a gradual accumulation of CEP170 up to mitotic rounding , when most centrosome staining is lost . The second wave involves rapid targeting of CEP170 following cytokinesis that dissipates over hours .

A similar analysis of cells treated with KIF2A or KIF2C RNAi revealed persistent CEP170 staining after mitosis ( Fig . 6d ) , consistent with the previously noted IFM phenotype of interphase cells depleted of KIF2A and a subtle effect of KIF2C depletion ( Fig . 6b ) . Overall , quantitative imaging of CEP170 localization to centrosomes confirmed the functional significance of three pairwise protein interactions discovered by physical interaction screening . Kinesin - 1 forms asymmetric motor complexes A central question in the study of intracellular trafficking is how a single motor protein sorts multiple cellular cargoes to their appropriate destination . The classic example is conventional kinesin , a complex of two KIF5B heavy chains and two kinesin light chains ( KLCs ) that regulate cargo binding and motor activity . KIF5B is a ubiquitously expressed microtubule plus - end - directed motor required to transport a variety of cargoes 10 , 12 , 34 , 38 , 39 . Mammalian genomes contain four KLC genes , each encoding multiple splice isoforms 40 . Biochemical analysis of tissue - derived conventional kinesin or engineered complementary DNA constructs for KLC1 and KLC2 in cultured cells suggests that KLC homodimers bind KIF5B exclusively 41 , 42 . However , it is unclear whether native KLCs uniquely form homodimers . We found that HeLa cells express all four KLC genes ( see Supplementary Tables S1 and S5 ) , permitting a re - evaluation of the KLC homodimer model by combining BAC transgenomics with the sensitivity of AP – MS . First , we investigated whether the soluble KIF5B pool was different from that associated with membrane - bound organelles ( MBOs ) . Light membranes were physically isolated from six different HeLa motor BAC lines for AP – MS using a simplified vesicle isolation protocol 43 to compare cytoplasmic and MBO - associated protein interactomes . KLC1 , KLC2 and KLC4 were the only KIF5B – LAP - specific proteins identified among the vesicle markers recovered from captured MBOs . Moreover , quantification of MS peptide intensities revealed no difference in the stoichiometry of KLC1 or KLC2 between cytosolic and MBO - associated pools of conventional kinesin ( Fig . 7a ) .

( d ) Western blot ( WB ) analysis of lysates ( L ) and anti - GFP immune pellets ( IP ) from HeLa hKLC4 – LAP cells . The arrows mark the expected positions of recombinant KLC4 ( green ) and native KLC1 ( black ) isoforms . Uncropped images of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . S7 . Therefore , we could not distinguish soluble from membrane - associated conventional kinesin . Expression of multiple KLC genes and their isoforms may lead to combinatorial assembly of conventional kinesin containing KLC hetero and homodimers with distinct cargo - binding properties . To investigate this potential , we first generated clonal HeLa BAC lines for each KLC gene tagged at its 3 (cid:48) - most stop codon . LAP - tagged KLC1 and KLC3 transgenes were expressed as single isoforms , whereas KLC2 and KLC4 produced multiple polypeptides , consistent with predicted splice isoforms ( see Supplementary Fig . S6A ) . As expected for functional KLCs , all four LAP - tagged transgenes bind native KIF5B ( see Supplementary Fig . S6B ) and KLC1 – LAP , like KIF5B – LAP , binds native MBOs in HeLa cells ( see Supplementary Fig . S6C ) . Having established that KLC1 – LAP binds KIF5B in HeLa cells , we further investigated which KLC1 isoform is recovered with KLC1 – LAP . Western blotting of whole lysates and anti - GFP immune pellets revealed that whereas the KIF5B – LAP transgene binds all native KLC1 polypeptides , theKLC1 – LAPtransgeneselectivelybindsashortisoform ( Fig . 7b ) . Follow - up analysis of the AP – MS peptide coverage maps identified isoform - specific peptides to show that two native transcripts were recovered with KLC1 – LAP ( see Supplementary Fig . S6D ) , the longerspliceproductbeingbarelyundetectablebywesternblotting . Systematic anti - GFP immunoprecipitation from KLC – LAP cell lines further supports the formation of asymmetric conventional kinesin in cells . Our AP – MS results indicated that KLC1 – LAP and KLC4 – LAP transgenes recover the products of other KLC genes ( Fig . 7c and Supplementary Table S5 ) and independently confirmed binding of KLC4 – LAP to KLC1 ( Fig . 7d ) . Quantification of KLC recovered with each KLC transgene , relative to the equivalent KIF5B , further revealed promiscuity of KLC1 and KLC4 , but not KLC2 and KLC3 , transgenes . We note with interest that KLC3 , the most divergent member of this protein family , does not recover other KLCs , and may form homodimers exclusively ( Fig . 7c ) . Our biochemical analysis clearly demonstrates the formation of asymmetric conventional kinesin by some KLC gene products in HeLa cells . DISCUSSION A central challenge in systems biology is integrating data from single - gene analyses spanning multiple phenotypic assays , cell lines , model organisms , and investigators . Complementary starting points such as localization , physical or genetic interactions provide functional hypotheses to probe our understanding of physiologically relevant processes . Therefore , the development of standardized resources allowing proteomic analysis of gene function across cell lines and in the whole organism is essential for the future of systems biology . In this report we present a set of resources to investigate all members of a protein superfamily : the structurally related myosin and kinesin superfamily of cytoskeletal motors . The use of recombinant BAC transgenes is a powerful , high - throughput approach to investigate motor protein function in multiple cell types as third alleles . In light of highly efficient BAC tagging ( 92 % ) and cell transfection ( 93 % ) , the main limitation remains the availability of BACs containing the complete human gene ( 69 % ) . The higher coverage for BACs containing orthologous mouse motor genes ( 87 % ) of similar size suggests that this will be remedied as more human - derived BAC libraries become available , with the possibility of BAC stitching to cover larger genes 44 . The generation of a transgenic mouse line expressing tagged KIF23 demonstrates that even essential genes can be studied in vivo using BAC transgenes . Tandem - affinity tags are excellent tools to isolate stable protein complexes that are relatively clean of contaminating proteins 13 . However , recent work shows that with modern quantitative MS , nonspecific proteins can be filtered out even when a single anti - GFP step is performed to capture the tagged protein complexes 20 . Therefore , we adopted a more general approach relying on a large number of immunoprecipitation experiments with related genes and a universal tag to identify common nonspecific interactions . Our AP – MS analysis identified over 180 protein – protein interactions in HeLa cells . In combination with multiple cell treatments for each 332 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2013 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . R E S O U R C E cell line , we discovered an extra 10 interactors for 5 motors with previously known interaction partners 13 . The high proportion of known interactions ( 20 % ) or co - localization of binding partners ( 35 % ) indicates a high - quality interaction set . Motor – motor interactions were mitosis specific , consistent with assembly of supramolecular structures such as the spindle midzone or the actomyosin cortex . Interaction nodes binding multiple motor proteins can either regulate , such as PLK1 ( ref . 45 ) and PRC1 ( ref . 46 ) , or be regulated by ( Fig . 5b – d ) their cognate binding partners . Mitotic protein complexes may be more soluble or stable , because transport motors ( KIF5B and KIF3C ) recovered known holoenzymes , but otherwise no cargo adaptors . Sucrose gradient analysis of conventional kinesin also indicates labile cargo binding ( see Supplementary Fig . S7C ) . Overall , this study elaborates a set of protein interactions and validates the functionality of our BAC transgenes for use in appropriate cell lines . The CEP170 localization network we describe illustrates how multiple motor proteins contribute to organelle assembly . Centrosome assembly involves organization of a complex protein mixture into a supramolecular structure , controlled by the cell cycle . Quantitative analysis of protein localization in live cells with BAC transgenes revealed changes in CEP170 targeting that were previously unclear using binary phenotypes or fixed time - point assays . The mechanism of CEP170 clearance by KIF2A and KIF2C reveals an active mechanism for post - mitotic centrosome remodelling . In this respect , CEP170 is a defined PCM marker whose epistatic relationship to other centrosome proteins can be investigated in greater detail . An important discovery of this report is the formation of asymmetric conventional kinesin motor complexes in HeLa cells . This may contribute to motor regulation at the composite interaction surfaces formed by KLC heterodimers 38 . However , this potential does not extend across metazoans as many genomes encode only a single KLC gene . Therefore , combinatorial assembly of conventional kinesin may be a mammalian solution to the problem of cargo discrimination . Multiple KLC genes are expressed in primary human immune cells ( see Supplementary Table S1 ) , and presumably other cell types , suggesting that research on the consequences of asymmetry in light - chain composition could be an important topic to further understand the specificity of intracellular trafficking .

DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb2689 M E T H O D S METHODS Cell culture and imaging . HeLa cells and mouse R1 embryonic stem cells 47 ( mESCs ) stably expressing tagged BACs were established and cultured as described previously 14 . Mouse Neuro2a ( ref . 48 ) neuroblastoma cell culture , transfection and selection were identical to HeLa cells . BI2536 ( Calbiochem , 100nM ) , thymidine ( Sigma - Aldrich , 2mM ) , S - trityl - l - cysteine ( Sigma - Aldrich , 2 µ M ) or nocodazole ( Sigma - Aldrich , 250ngml − 1 ) were added to the imaging medium , as required . Gene - specific PCR flanking the tagging site was used to confirm the identity and proper tagging of each BAC , as described previously 14 . Anti - GFP western blotting of lysate for each HeLa BAC pool was performed on nitrocellulose membranes ( GE Healthcare ) using mouse - anti - GFP clone 7 . 1 ( Roche Applied Sciences , catalogue number 11814460001 , 0 . 2 µ gml − 1 ) , goat - anti - mouse HRP conjugate ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) antibodies and the ECL Plus detection system ( GE Healthcare ) . Of 230 HeLa BAC pools , 116 ( 51 % ) had no detectable GFP signal , and 79 ( 33 % ) showedtheGFP - positivebandofexpectedsize . The32 ( 14 % ) BACpoolsexpressing truncated proteins included 28 tagged , heterologously expressed motors and 4 tagged , endogenously expressed motors ( see Supplementary Table S3 ) . Therefore , we expect that BACs encoding endogenous motors produce the correct gene product . ThefrequencyofGFP - positivecellsinHeLaBACpoolswasgenerallyhigherthan 10 % . Expression of recombinant protein varies between FACS - sorted HeLa BAC clones ( see Supplementary Fig . S1 ) , as previously reported 15 . When multiple bands appear in western blots of HeLa BAC pool lysates , those bands are also observed in FACS - sorted clones ( see Supplementary Fig . S6A ) . To image HeLa and mESC BAC lines , cells were grown overnight on 11 - mm glass coverslips for paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) or cold methanol fixation and staining , as described previously 13 . Primary antibodies included polyclonal goat - anti - GFP ( prepared by the MPI - CBG Protein Expression Facility , 1 µ gml − 1 ) , mouse anti - α - tubulin ( Sigma - Aldrich , clone DM1A , 0 . 5 µ gml − 1 ) and rabbit anti - APC ( Abcam , ab15270 , 1 : 2 , 000 ) . Secondary staining included Alexa - conjugated antibodies ( Invitrogen , catalogue numbers A21203 and A31573 , 1 µ gml − 1 ) as required , and Hoechst 33342 ( Calbiochem , 10 µ gml − 1 ) before mounting coverslips with Mowiol ( Calbiochem ) . Images were taken on a wide - field microscope ( Axioplan 2 ; Zeiss ) equipped with a CS4742 - 95 CCD ( charge - coupled device ) camera ( Hamamatsu GmbH ) and processed using Photoshop ( Adobe ) . For live - cell fluorescence imaging , cells were grown in 8 - well Lab - Tek II imaging chambers ( Nunc GmbH ) . Standard culture medium was exchanged for CO 2 - independent medium ( Invitrogen ) before imaging on a DeltaVision ( Applied Precision ) instrument equipped with a CoolSnap HQ CCD camera ( Princeton Instruments ) controlled by softWoRx software ( Applied Precision ) in a climate - controlled environment maintained at 37 ◦ C . Transgenic Neuro2a cells were seeded overnight on 11mm coverslips in 24 - well plates , differentiated , fixed , stained , as previously described 29 , and imaged on a DeltaVision system . We confirmed the phenotypic effects for mitotic enrichment protocols by imaging live HeLa cells expressing mCherry – Histone 2B and TUBB1 – LAP ( ref . 13 ; see Supplementary Fig . S4A ) . HeLa cells were 0 . 5 – 1 % mitotic in medium alone and 20 – 30 % mitotic following double thymidine synchronization and release 49 ( 10 – 12h ) . Prometaphase arrest using nocodazole 13 ( 18h ) or S - trityl - l - cysteine ( 18h ; ref . 50 ) resulted in 50 – 70 % rounded cells with the expected microtubule phenotypes . Endoribonuclease - prepared short interfering RNAs ( esiRNAs ) were prepared usingthefollowingprimers ( seeSupplementaryTableS6 ) , asdescribedpreviously 51 . Reverse - transfection with Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the modifications outlined below . For IFM , HeLa cells were reverse - transfected with 0 . 35 µ g esiRNA and 1 . 5 µ l Oligofectamine in 24 - well tissue culture dishes containing a glass coverslip in each well at a density of 40 , 000 cells per well . For live - cell imaging , a clonal ( mouse CEP170 – LAP ) HeLa cell line was reverse - transfected with 0 . 3 µ g esiRNA and 1 µ l Oligofectamine in 8 - well Lab - Tek II ( Nunc GmbH ) or µ - Slide 8 - well ( Ibidi GmbH ) imaging chambers . Two days after transfection , we exchanged the medium and began live - cell imaging , as described above . Contrary to the phenotype reported for U2OS cells 52 , but broadly consistent with a recent publication 37 , we observed no monopolar spindles in KIF2A - depleted HeLa cells . Fetalcalfserum ( FCS ) andhumanserum ( HS ) usedforimmunocyteculturewere heat - inactivatedandfilteredbeforeuse . Humanperipheralbloodmononuclearcells ( PBMCs ) wereisolatedfromthebuffycoatsofanonymousblooddonors ( RedCross blood donation service in Dresden ) by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI ( Invitrogen ) . Immune cell types were isolated with MACS MicroBeads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) , cultured and collected for flow cytometry or total RNA isolation . To prepare flow cytometry samples , 1 × 10 5 cells were incubated for 30min at 4 ◦ C with fluorescently conjugated antibodies ( BD Bioscience , 1 . 4 µ gml − 1 unless otherwise indicated ) , washed and resuspended in 1ml FACS buffer ( 1 % BSA and 0 . 1 % sodium azide in PBS ) and analysed within 24h on a BDLSRII Flow Cytometer System operated by FACS Diva ( BD Biosciences ) software . Raw flow cytometry data were analysed using FlowJo version 7 . 5 ( Tree Star ) . All cell types were > 95 % pure . Monocytes were isolated from PBMCs using MACS CD14 microbeads , seeded at a density of 2 . 5 × 10 6 cells per well in 6 - well dishes and differentiated , as described below . Macrophages were generated by culturing monocytes in DMEM GlutaMAX ( Invtirogen ) supplementedwith l - glutamine , penicillin / streptomycin , 20 % FCSand 10 % HS . Medium was replaced at days 1 and 5 . Cells were collected after 7 days . For flowcytometry , macrophageswerestainedwithCD14 – FITC ( cloneM5E2 , catalogue number 555397 ) , CD16 – PB ( clone 3G8 , catalogue number 558122 , 0 . 8 µ gml − 1 ) , CD45RO – PeCy7 ( clone UCHL1 , catalogue number 337168 ) , CD31 – PE ( clone WM59 , catalogue number 555446 ) , CD25 – APC – Cy7 ( clone M - A251 , catalogue number 557753 ) and CD69 – APC ( clone L78 , catalogue number 340560 ) . Immature dendritic cells were obtained by culturing monocytes for six days in RPMI supplemented with 3 % FCS , l - glutamine , penicillin / streptomycin , 50ngml − 1 GM - CSF ( R & D Systems ) and 10ngml − 1 IL - 4 ( R & D Systems ) . This medium was exchanged for RPMI supplemented with 5 % FCS , l - glutamine , 10ngml − 1 lipopolysaccharide and 100Uml − 1 interferon gamma ( R & D Systems ) and incubated for 24h to prepare the mature dendritic cells . For flow cytometry , dendritic cells were stained with CD14 – PeCy7 ( clone M5E2 , catalogue number 557742 ) , CD40 – APC ( clone 5C3 , catalogue number 555591 ) , CD45RA – PE ( clone HI100 , cataloguenumber555489 ) andCD1a – FITC ( cloneHI149 , cataloguenumber 555806 ) . CD4 + T - cells were isolated using a primary negative depletion of PBMCs using MACS Naïve CD4 + T Cell Isolation Kit II or Memory CD4 + T Cell Isolation Kit II , followed by secondary negative depletion with CD25 microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) to remove regulatory T - cells . The resulting naive or memory T - cells were resuspended in X - Vivo ( Lonza ) medium supplemented with 10 % HS , seeded at 200 , 000 cells per well in 96 - well plates ( Corning V - plates ) and stimulated with a Dynabeads CD3 / CD28 T - cell expander ( Invitrogen ) for 3 days . For flow cytometry , T - cells were stained with CD3 – APC ( clone UCHT1 , catalogue number 555335 ) , CD4 – PB ( clone RPA - T4 , catalogue number 558116 , 0 . 8 µ gml − 1 ) , CD8 – PerCP ( cloneSK1 , cataloguenumber345774 ) , CD45RO – PeCy7 , CD25 – APC – Cy7 , CD40L – PE ( clone 89 - 76 , catalogue number 340477 ) and CD69 – FITC ( clone FN50 , catalogue number 557049 ) . KIF23 – EGFP transgenic mouse analysis . Transgenic mice were prepared by pronuclear injection of purified BAC DNA into C57BL / 6 oocytes . Tail clippings from the resulting mice were genotyped using the C - terminal checking primers . For microscopy , adult mice and embryos were selected for tissue isolation . Midbody fluorescence signal in embryos was inherited from either male or female transgenic parents . A female mouse aged 32 weeks was euthanized to prepare tissue lysates for anti - GFP western blot analysis . Mouse brains from embryonic day 14 . 5 embryos or tissues from adult mice were fixed overnight at 4 ◦ C with 4 % PFA in 120mM phosphate buffer , at pH7 . 4 . The fixed samples were embedded ( 4 % agarose in PBS ) and sectioned ( 50 µ m ) with a Vibratome ( Leica Microsystems ) . Sections were permeabilized ( 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , 30min ) , quenched ( 100mM glycine , 30min ) , blocked ( 10min ) in antibody dilution buffer ( PBS , 300mM NaCl , 0 . 2 % gelatin ) , stained ( DAPI and phalloidin , 1h ) andmountedinMowiol . ImageswereacquiredonaZeissLSM510Meta , using a × 63 Plan - Apochromat 1 . 4 NA oil - immersion objective ( Carl Zeiss ) . Microarray transcription profiling . Total RNA was isolated from cell pellets using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Immune - cell - derived samples were analysed as biological triplicates . HeLa cell samples , parental HeLa cells and 13 HeLa BAC pools or clones were analysed as singles . The MPI - CBG microarray facility performed all RNA labelling , hybridization and microarray scanning following the Agilent One - Colour Microarray - Based Gene Expression Analysis ( Quick Amp ) protocol version 5 . 7 . Briefly , 1 . 65 µ g of Cy3 - labelled complementary RNA was hybridized to human whole transcriptome microarrays ( Agilent , 4x44K , AMADID : 014850 ) and scanned using the Agilent Microarray Scanner ( Agilent ) . Agilent kinesin or myosin ( 134 microarray probes ) and all KLC ( 8 probes ) genes . Raw image data were converted into numerical data using Agilent Feature Extraction Software , version 10 . 1 . Quantile normalization of data in two batches ( HeLa or immune cell samples ) was performed with Partek Genomics Suite 6 . 5 ( Partek ) . Comparison of microarray probe intensities to the published deep sequencing and proteome in HeLa cells 53 established 68 ( 48 % ) true positive and 28 ( 20 % ) true negative probes . For the remaining 21 ( 34 % ) probes , 18 were confirmed as true positives or true negatives on the basis of immunocyte - selective expression profiles in BioGPS ( ref . 54 ) , the Gene Expression Omnibus 55 ( GEO ) and the scientific literature ( see Supplementary Table S1 ) .

For AP – MS samples , HeLa BAC pools were cultured to 50 % confluent monolayers before treatment , collected , immunoprecipitated with polyclonal goat anti - GFP crosslinked to Sepharose protein G ( GE Healthcare ) and finallyelutedwithlow - pHglycine , asdescribedpreviously 56 . Eluatewasimmediately neutralized with 1M Tris – HCl ( pH 9 . 0 ) and submitted for trypsin digestion ( 90 % ) , as below , or quality control ( 10 % ) by western blotting and silver staining . Aprotocolforsubcellular - fractionation - andimmuno - adsorbentbasedisolation of vesicular membranes 43 was adapted for recovery of motor - protein - associated vesicles from HeLa cells at 4 ◦ C . The immuno - isolation matrix was prepared by conjugation of polyclonal goat anti - GFP antibodies with diazocellulose 57 and stored at 4 ◦ C in PBS - G ( PBS with 0 . 1 % gelatin ( EMD ) ) . Approximately 10 8 cells from each HeLa BAC pool were collected by scraping into MB ( 50mM HEPES – KOH ( pH7 . 4 ) , 150mMNaCl , 2mMMgCl 2 , 1mMEGTAand10 % sucrose ) and physically disrupted by passing through a narrow - gauge needle . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation ( 10min , 10 , 000 g ) and vesicles were isolated by pelleting the supernatant ( 90min , 180 , 000 g ) onto a 50 µ l 35 % ( w / w ) sucrose cushion . The cushion and membrane - rich interface were resuspended in a total volume of 500 µ l with PBS - G and gently clarified ( 5min , 1 , 000 g ) . The supernatant was incubated with the anti - GFP matrix ( 4 ◦ C , 4h ) on a rotating shaker . The matrix was recovered by centrifugation ( 2min , 1 , 500 g ) , rinsed 3 times and resuspended in PBS - G . The resultingmaterialwassplitevenlybetweentwoelutionprotocolsbeforeneutralizingwithTris – HCl , as above ; specific elution ( overnight , 4 ◦ C ) with TEV protease ( MPI - CBG Protein Expression Facility ) , or low - pH glycine 56 . To prepare microsomes for density gradient centrifugation , HeLa cells were collectedbyscrapinginMB , physicallydisruptedandclarified , asabove . Microsomes were pelleted ( 90min , 100 , 000 g ) , resuspended in MB and mixed with an equal volumeofiodixanol ( GEHealthcare ) . Astep - wise20 – 5 % iodixanoldensitygradient in MB was layered over the resuspended microsomes for centrifugation ( 4h , 100 , 000 g ) . Density gradient fractions were resolved by denaturing PAGE and analysed by western blotting . Direct analysis of protein complexes by mass spectrometry . Neutralized protein samples were digested overnight with 16ng µ l − 1 trypsin ( Promega ) at 39 ◦ C . The tryptic peptides were captured using a UltraMicroSpin - C18 ( The Nest Group ) cartridge and eluted with 4 : 1 acetonitrile ( ACN ) / water buffered with 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) , dried and dissolved in 10 µ l 0 . 1 % TFA . Of the resulting sample , 40 % was loaded onto a Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system ( Dionex ) , concentrated on a trapping microcolumn ( 5mm × 300mm i . d . ) packed with 5 µ m C18 PepMAP100 ( Dionex ) and resolved using a nanocolumn ( 15cm × 75 µ m i . d . ) packed with 3 µ m C18 PepMAP100 ( Dionex ) operating a 3h elution gradient of solvent A ( 95 : 5 H 2 O / ACN ( v / v ) , 0 . 1 % formic acid ) and solvent B ( 20 : 80 H 2 O / ACN ( v / v ) , 0 . 1 % formic acid ) , as follows : 73min ( 5 – 20 % B ) , 72min ( 20 – 50 % B ) , 5min ( 50 – 100 % B ) , 10min ( 100 % B ) , 10min ( 100 – 5 % B ) and 10min ( 5 % B ) . The nanoLC interfaced on - line with an LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) through a robotic nanoflow ion source TriVersa ( Advion BioSciences ) equipped with a liquid chromatography coupler and a 4 . 2 µ m nozzle diameter nanoESI chip operated at 1 . 7kV ionization voltage . Chipsoft 6 . 4 ( Advion Biosciences ) monitored electrospray current stability . One cycle of data - dependent acquisition mode MS / MS , under the control of Xcalibur 2 . 0 ( ThermoFisherScientific ) , consistedofonesurveymicroscan ( m / z = 300 – 1600 , target mass resolution = 60 , 000 full - width at half - maximum , target value = 10 6 ions ) in the Orbitrap analyser and then fragmentation of the four most abundant multiply charged precursors was acquired in one microscan ( normalized collision energy = 35 % , lineariontraptargetvalue = 10 4 ions , ionselectionthreshold = 400 counts , precursor ions isolation width = 2a . m . u . ) . Activation parameters ( q = 0 . 25 , activation time = 30ms and dynamic exclusion = 90s ) were applied . The . raw files were converted to . mgf ( MASCOT generic format ) format using the extract _ msn utility in Bioworks 3 . 1 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and searched against the International Protein Index — Human database ( 68360 sequence entries ) using MASCOT v . 2 . 4 ( Matrix Science ) . In the ESI - Trap instrument profile , precursor and fragment mass tolerances were 10 ppm and 0 . 6Da , respectively . One missed cleavage , methionine oxidation , N - terminal acetylation and phosphorylations ( serine , threonineandtyrosine ) wereallowed . MASCOTproteinidentificationshad a total score above 60 considering individual peptides with ion scores above 20 . The . raw files were first converted to mzXML format using ReAdW v 4 . 3 . 1 ( ref . 58 ) . MASCOT data files were separately processed through the Trans - Proteomic Pipeline 59 to generate a pep . xml file compatible with label - free quantification by SuperHirn v0 . 03 ( ref . 60 ) . Default settings were used with the following exceptions : MS1 retention time tolerance = 2 , MS2 PPM m / z tolerance = 15 , MS1 feature CHRG range min = 2 , MS1 data centroid data = 0 , MS1 feature signaltonoisethreshold = 3 . 0 . EachmzXMLanditscorrespondingpep . xmlpeptide identification file were individually processed using SuperHirn feature extraction and master map creation tools to calculate the integrated peptide intensity for each identified peptide in each MS acquisition . Unique peptides were mapped onto the recombinant tag and expected motor protein sequence . Candidate interaction partners were identified on the basis of the number of unique gene - specific peptides in the sample and their cumulative MASCOT score . We discarded candidate interactors appearing in control lines ( HeLa – GFP or HeLa ) or when the expected transgene was not detected , as previously described 30 – 32 . Finally , we discarded candidate interactors binding more than five motor proteins . The resulting pairwise interaction list was compared to protein – protein interactions in BioGRID ( 2011 version ) 61 , co - localization data and the scientific literature ( see Supplementary Table S5 ) .
