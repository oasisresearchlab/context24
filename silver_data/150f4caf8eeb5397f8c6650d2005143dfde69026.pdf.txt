Pfeffer School of Biological Sciences , Victoria University of Wellington , Kelburn Parade , Wellington 6010 , New Zealand PLP , 0000 - 0001 - 5933 - 9728 Using embryological data from 14 mammalian orders , the hypothesis is presented that in placental mammals , epiblast cavitation and polar tropho - blast loss are alternative developmental solutions to shield the central epiblast from extraembryonic signalling . It is argued that such reciprocal sig - nalling between the edge of the epiblast and the adjoining polar trophoblast or edge of the mural trophoblast or with the amniotic ectoderm is necessary for the induction of gastrulation . This article is part of the theme issue ‘ Extraembryonic tissues : exploring concepts , definitions and functions across the animal kingdom ’ . 1 . Introduction August Rauber noticed in 1875 that the epiblast of early rabbit embryos was covered by a thin layer of cells that subsequently dissolves [ 1 ] . He termed this the ‘ Deckschicht ’ , but it was Koellicker who realised that these cells were trophoblast and who named the layer after its discoverer [ 2 ] . That notation has henceforth been used in species where the trophoblast overlying the epi - blast is lost ( figure 1 ) . However , mentioning ‘ Rauber ’ s layer ’ may well meet with incomprehension even among developmental biologists . This can be explained by the brief existence and the perceived inconsequential nature of this tissue , even though half of all mammalian species possess it . I will here place Rauber ’ s layer in a new context , paradoxically emphasizing the importance of its disappearance rather than its existence . 2 . Events leading to the formation of polar trophoblast After fertilization , the proteinaceous zona pellucida surrounding the egg hard - ens and the mammalian zygote undergoes successive rounds of cleavage , that is , cell divisions without concomitant growth . In monotreme ( platypus and echidna ) and marsupial mammals , the developing embryo is further enclosed by a permeable egg shell layer and the dividing cells coalesce and then grow along the inside surface of these containing layers to eventually form a hollow single - layered spherical epithelium . When this sphere consists of several hundred cells , a patch of cells destined to form the pluriblast can be identified [ 3 ] . It is the pluriblast that will give rise to the fetus as well as most extraem - bryonic membranes [ 4 ] . During further development the pluriblast develops into ( i ) the epiblast , which is the progenitor layer of the embryo proper , and ( ii ) the underlying hypoblast ( also termed primitive endoderm ) , which mainly gives rise to the yolk sac . The non - pluriblast ( major ) part of the hollow spherical embryo is the trophoblast , which will form the outermost layer of the chorion [ 5 ] . Notably , in these two ancestral branches of mammals , the trophoblast does not cover the pluriblast , but abuts it in a planar fashion , creating a trophoblast – pluriblast epithelial border that is subsequently resolved into a trophoblast – epiblast border ( figure 2 ) . © 2022 The Author ( s ) Published by the Royal Society . All rights reserved . The third branch of mammals , the placental mammals , or eutherians , diverged over the last 100 Myr into four superor - dinal groups ( figure 2 ) , the oldest branches being the Xenarthrans ( two extant orders ; e . g . armadillo ) and Afrother - ians ( six orders ; e . g . elephants , elephant shrew , tenrec ) . The most recent branching led to the populous Laurasiatherians ( six orders including carnivores , most farm animals and bats ) and Euarchontoglirians ( five orders including primates , rodents , rabbits and cologu ) . Common and unique to all 19 orders is the formation of the blastocyst - embryo , a spherical structure consisting of a unilaminar trophoblast epithelium surrounding a fluid - filled cavity that is partially filled with a clump of pluriblast - like cells termed the inner cell mass ( ICM ) . Importantly , as the ICM cluster is located eccentrically within the blastocyst cavity , two types of trophoblast can be distinguished : the polar trophoblast overlying the ICM and the mural trophoblast that does not ( figure 1 ) . This eutherian - specific combination of tissues is fundamentally different from that in monotreme and marsupial mammals in that a novel cell population and interactive interface have been created , namely the polar trophoblast and the interaction of this layer with the entire outermost ( dorsal ) ICM surface . As we shall see , this novel configuration has led to alternate developmental strategies . Before following the polar trophoblast fate further , it is worth noting that this trophoblast arose because of the intern - alization of the pluriblast . Epiblast internalization is likely to have been an adaptation to cope with the loss of the amniote eggshell [ 41 ] , which in non - placental mammals is still present at early embryonic stages . Loss of the shell would result in more extensive and intimate cell contact between conceptus and maternal endometrium , which benefits efficient nutrient and oxygen transfer , but also requires differentiation of the interacting outside cells . Internalization of the pluriblast cells thus has two advantages . First , the inside cells would have been freed from the differentiative and epithelial polar - ization requirements placed on outer cells , allowing inside cells to follow alternative ( viz . pluripotent / ICM ) fates . Second , having only one cell type on the outside would minimize the number of antigens presented to the maternal immune system . 3 . Alternative trajectories of the polar trophoblast Somewhat unexpectedly , once formed , the fate of the polar tro - phoblast diverges dramatically among eutherians ( figures 1 and 2 ) . In roughly half the orders , the polar trophoblast layer is lost and hence is termed Rauber ’ s layer . In the other species , the polar trophoblast keeps proliferating and is some - times variably referred to as extraembryonic ectoderm ( murines ) or cytotrophoblast ( primates , bats ) . Both types of polar trophoblast fates are seen in species of all four superor - dinal groups ( figure 2 ) . Furthermore , in four mammalian orders ( rodents , primates , Eulipotyphlians ( hedgehog versus true shrew ) , Afrosorcidians ( tenrec versus golden mole ) ) , a mixture of Rauber ’ s layer and polar trophoblast - retaining species exist ( figure 2 ) . Together this suggests that a switch from one state to the other has occurred repeatedly during evolution . It is likely that the Rauber ’ s layer ( loss ) condition is the less derived one based on the observation that within the primates and rodents , species in the more primitive / ances - tral branches lose the polar trophoblast , as do their closest sister - orders , colugos and rabbits , respectively [ 20 ] . Preceding the bifurcation in polar trophoblast fate , the underlying ICM cells differentiate into either NANOG - and SOX2 - expressing epiblast cells or GATA6 - positive hypoblast cells as shown for mice [ 42 ] , rabbits [ 43 ] , cattle [ 44 ] , pigs [ 45 ] , marmoset monkeys [ 46 ] and humans [ 47 ] . In these species , the hypoblast and epiblast progenitors are initially interspersed within the ICM , but soon segregate into an ellip - soid of epiblast cells touching the polar trophoblast on the outside - facing surface , and a layer of hypoblast cells covering the blastocyst cavity - facing inner side ( figure 1 ) [ 48 ] . In ele - phant shrews , tenrecs and the lesser bulldog bat , ICM formation is delayed and hypoblast may be formed without a sorting phase , but no expression analyses have been under - taken [ 28 , 37 , 49 ] . Either way , in all cases the polar trophoblast initially overlays the early or ‘ naive ’ epiblast . ( a ) Rauber ’ s layer species At the naive epiblast stage , electron micrographs reveal a close apposition of polar trophoblast ( Rauber ’ s layer ) cells with the underlying epiblast in Rauber ’ s layer species such as the horse [ 25 ] , pig [ 50 ] , cattle [ 51 ] and rabbit [ 13 ] . While a basement membrane ( Reichert ’ s membrane ) is formed in regions where the mural trophoblast contacts the expanding hypoblast layer , no such matrix is formed between Rauber ’ s layer and the epiblast . Thus Rauber ’ s layer is exposed to sig - nals from the epiblast , but what the signals are that contribute to its disappearance , is not known . Potentially fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) signalling could be involved , because in pigs , Rauber ’ s layer expresses more FGF receptor 2 ( FGFR2 ) than the rest of the trophoblast [ 52 ] . The mode and mechanism of Rauber ’ s layer dis - appearance appears not to be conserved .

In polar trophoblast ( TB ) - main - taining mammals the epiblast develops a cavity termed the amniotic cavity or , if the roof ( shown in brown ) is lost / absent , a proamniotic cavity . Part of the hypoblast thickens to form the anterior hypoblast ( AH ) , also termed anterior visceral endoderm , which secretes inhibitors that pattern the epiblast . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il .

B 377 : 2021025 4 3 disappearance , the layer thins in some species , possibly because of stretching forces arising as the underlying epiblast morphs from a spheroid to a flatter shape while actively pro - liferating . While this may contribute to the multiple breaks appearing in Rauber ’ s layer as described for the rabbit [ 13 ] and horse [ 25 ] , such a mechanism would not be universal , as for example in cats , Rauber ’ s layer is lost before any change is detected in epiblast surface area [ 20 ] . Similarly , in cattle epiblast , expansion occurs in all three dimensions , while the proliferation rate is equal in Rauber ’ s layer and the epiblast , thus precluding the possibility of the epiblast outgrowing the trophoblast [ 53 ] . In the horse [ 25 ] , cattle [ 53 ] and rabbit [ 13 ] apoptosis is involved , while in pigs there is evidence for a combination of apoptosis and autopha - gocytosis [ 27 ] . Subsequently , polar trophoblast cell remnants are phagocytosed by the underlying epiblast cells in the rabbit [ 13 ] , horse [ 25 ] and pig [ 27 ] . By contrast , in the skunk ( order Carnivoria ) , peripheral displacement rather than cell death was suggested to underly Rauber ’ s layer disappearance [ 22 ] . The mode of Rauber ’ s layer loss varies too . In rabbits and horses , multiple breaks appear all over Rauber ’ s layer with surviving cells scattered across the expanding epiblast for a while [ 13 , 25 ] . In pigs and cattle , asymmetric holes develop that then merge , transiently leaving coalescent patches of polar trophoblast still adhered to epiblast [ 26 , 27 , 53 ] . In pigs , some of these Rauber ’ s layer cells are lost together with ( and while still adhering to ) the outside - most ( dorsal ) cells of the epiblast [ 27 ] . It is likely that these different modes of Rauber ’ s layer loss reflect the relative adhesion of polar trophoblast to themselves in comparison to epiblast cells . What is conserved however , is the maintenance of the embryo ’ s overall epithelial integrity . In other words , at the time that Rauber ’ s layer is lost , naive epiblast cells , particu - larly those closest to the inside , start forming junctional contacts with neighbouring epiblast cells as well as with the mural trophoblast cells located at the edge of the epiblast mass . This has been shown in rabbits [ 13 ] , cattle [ 51 , 54 ] , horses [ 25 ] and pigs [ 27 , 55 ] . These close contacts are the first indication of epiblast epithelialization and preserve the turgidity of the blastocyst as the junctional integrity of Rauber ’ s layer is lost . Hence an inward collapse of the blasto - cyst is prevented , and a barrier between the blastocyst cavity and the outside ( maternal ) environment is maintained [ 50 ] . The incumbent epithelialization process represents the tran - sition of naive to a ‘ formative ’ [ 56 ] or ‘ epitheloid ’ epiblast [ 57 ] . Further cell polarization leads to the embryonic ectoderm epithelium or ‘ primed epiblast ’ ( primed for embryonic line - age determination ; [ 58 ] ) , which is likely to be the ancestral amniote pluriblast - derived configuration for gastrulation to proceed [ 57 ] . Morphologically , these epithelialization changes are accompanied by the conversion of the ellipsoid early naive epiblast to a planar or indented disc - shaped ( some - times pseudostratified ) primed epithelium ( figure 1 ) . In Rauber ’ s layer species , the apical side of the epiblast thus always becomes exposed to the maternal environment . Later in development , after gastrulation has begun , this direct exposure to the maternal environment is terminated by the folding of the edges of the embryonic ectoderm ( the ‘ amniotic ’ ectoderm ) over the embryonic disc to form the enclosing amniotic cavity . This mode of amniotic cavity formation is shared by Rauber ’ s layer species with the non - eutherian mammals and represents the ancestral mode of amnion formation also seen in non - mammalian Sauropsid amniotes , that is , birds and reptiles [ 59 ] ( figure 2 ) . ( b ) Species maintaining the polar trophoblast In non - Rauber ’ s layer species , the polar trophoblast is not only maintained until at least post - gastrulation stages but may be more proliferative than mural trophoblast . Mice represent the most extreme example of such differen - tial proliferation in that mural trophoblast cells undergo DNA endoreduplication to form polyploid giant cells , which are non - replicative , terminally differentiated , invasive trophoblast cells . Polar trophoblast cells , by contrast , maintain diploidy and proliferate rapidly into a mass of cells termed the extraem - bryonic ectoderm , that displaces the epiblast - spheroid into the blastocyst cavity to cause the embryo to assume an ‘ egg - cylin - der ’ configuration [ 60 ] . The polar trophoblast is dependent for its proliferation on FGF4 and transforming growth factor beta ( TGF β ) - like growth factors ( probably nodal growth differen - tiation factor ( NODAL ) ) secreted from the underlying naive epiblast [ 61 – 64 ] . Signalling downstream of FGF can be visual - ized via extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) and AKT phosphorylation , and was found to be restricted to polar tro - phoblast [ 61 ] . An alternative assay , using mice genetically modified with an ERK - reporter , revealed a signalling gradient in the trophoblast , with highest activity in the polar region [ 65 ] . Similar to the mouse , in guinea pigs , belonging to the rodent suborder Hystricomorpha , the polar trophoblast requires signals from the epiblast to maintain cell division and to prevent premature differentiation into giant cells , as shown under in vitro culture conditions [ 66 ] . In higher primates ( parvorder Catarrhini ) such as humans and rhesus monkeys , both polar and mural tropho - blast proliferates but is more intense on the epiblast - containing ( embryonic ) polar side [ 8 , 67 , 68 ] . In human embryos cultured in two - or three - dimensions , increasing dis - tance from the OCT4 - positive epiblast resulted in progressive differentiation of polar trophoblast - like cytotrophoblast cells into syncytiotrophoblast and then extravillous trophoblast cells [ 69 – 71 ] . This suggests that epiblast - derived signals pre - vent differentiation . The signals preventing such trophoblast terminal differentiation may include epidermal growth factor and WNT while TGF β - like pathways may promote it , as suggested from in vitro studies aimed at isolating human trophoblast stem cells [ 72 ] . In both mice and humans , one target of such signals may be the transcription factor complex TEAD4 / YAP1 , which activates numerous cell cycle genes required for proliferation and once activated , can maintain its own transcription [ 73 ] . In the natal clinging bat ( Miniopteridae ) , the California leaf - nosed bat and the long - tongued bat ( Phyllostomidae ) , preferential proliferation is again seen in the trophoblast hemisphere containing the epiblast [ 32 , 74 , 75 ] . In armadillos , polar trophoblast proliferates , while mural trophoblast degenerates [ 76 ] . However , in this species , the proliferation of polar trophoblast may not depend on signals from the ICM , as evidenced by trophoblast mitotic figures seen in an embryo with a necrotic ICM [ 77 ] . In all of the above examples , the initial site of attachment of the blastocyst to the uterine epithelium and / or subsequent uterine invasion is on the more - proliferative polar tropho - blast side of the embryo [ 59 , 78 ] . By contrast , most Rauber ’ s layer mammals which lose their polar trophoblast implant r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 377 : 2021025 4 4 on their abembryonic side or circumferentially [ 59 ] . In spite of this correlation , polar trophoblast maintenance is neither necessary for implantation on the embryonic side nor does it preclude abembryonic implantation : ( i ) some Rauber ’ s layer animals do implant on the embryonic side . Examples include Rauber ’ s layer rodents such as kangaroo rats ( Heteromyidae family ) and squirrels ( suborder Sciuromorpha ) where implan - tation does occur on the side , where the polar trophoblast was [ 16 ] , rabbits ( Lagomorpha ) and primi - tive primates such as lorises ; and ( ii ) in some species maintaining the polar trophoblast , uterine attachment is not on the embryonic side , but circumferential , i . e . also occurring on the mural tro - phoblast side , and thus likely to be independent of the polar trophoblast and of the underlying epiblast . Interestingly in these species , no preferential prolifer - ation of polar trophoblast occurs relative to mural trophoblast . Examples are the short - tailed fruit bat ( Phyllostomidae family ) and the little brown bat ( Ves - pertilionidae ) [ 29 , 30 ] . While not necessary , the frequent correlation of maintenance of polar trophoblast — which often involves signalling from the underlying epiblast — with implantation occurring on the embryonic side , suggests that such an arrangement is of evol - utionary benefit [ 15 , 78 , 79 ] . The benefit is likely to lie in the adaptation of novel modes of implantation . This may be best seen in primates and rodents . In the more ancestral species of these mammalian orders , polar trophoblast is lost , whereas in the more modern ones it is retained ( figure 2 ) , with a parallel trend for implantation on the abembryonic to embryonic ( polar ) side . With the embryonic - side implantation mode typi - cal of polar trophoblast - retaining species , novel , more invasive ( interstitial ) modes of implantation became more prominent , as discussed eloquently for primates by James P . Hill in his Croonian lecture [ 10 ] . The driving force for implantation on the embryonic side is not known , but it may be that this is a particularly effective arrangement to bring the trophoblast - derived chorion closer to the allantoic vasculature that links the chorioallantoic placenta to the embryo . 4 . Effects of the polar trophoblast on the epiblast Interactions that may occur between polar trophoblast and the underlying epiblast have been studied almost exclusively in mice . In mice not only is polar trophoblast proliferation depen - dent on signals from the epiblast ( § 3b ) , but the polar trophoblast reciprocally affects epiblast proliferation and patterning ( figure 3 a ) . The epiblast initially ubiquitously expresses mRNA coding for NODAL . NODAL is secreted as a less - active PRO - NODAL precursor and requires cleavage by the convertases FURIN or PACE4 to be fully active . These con - vertases diffuse into the epiblast from the trophoblast . As the diffusion distance of the convertases is limited , NODAL is acti - vated most effectively closest to the epiblast – trophoblast border [ 80 ] . The proximal NODAL activation is then stabilized by an auto - regulatory loop involving a NODAL - responsive enhancer driving NODAL expression . NODAL causes increased epiblast proliferation but also diffuses into the adjacent polar trophoblast to maintain convertase expression and BMP4 tran - scription [ 81 ] . Bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( BMP4 ) from the polar trophoblast diffuses into the epiblast to turn on transcrip - tion of the NODAL cofactor CRIPTO / TDGF1 [ 80 ] as well as WNT [ 81 ] . WNT , together with the activated NODAL , then switch on gastrulation genes such as BRACHYURY / T [ 82 ] . Importantly the reciprocal requirement for factors expressed only in adjacent tissues means that the end - outcome — in this case gastrulation induction — occurs at , and is dependent on , a boundary , in this case , the polar trophoblast – epiblast boundary . In the mouse , this boundary is circular , as both the epiblast and the polar trophoblast masses cavitate with the cavities sub - sequently joining [ 83 ] , leaving only the rim of the cup - shaped epiblast touching the rim of the hollowed - out polar trophoblast . Gastrulation then occurs on only the posterior side of this rim due to the influence of NODAL , BMP and WNT inhibitors secreted from the anterior region of the enveloping hypoblast [ 84 ] . Importantly , the epiblast in the distal region of the egg cylinder ( the base of the epiblast - cup ) is protected from the inductive influences of the polar trophoblast , ensuring that gas - trulation does not occur ectopically ( figure 3 b ) . In human embryos , which also retain the polar tropho - blast , some information has been gleaned from growing primed embryonic stem cells in two dimensions on micropat - terned slides . While this system is a far cry from the in vivo situation , the same signalling pathways seen in the mouse — NODAL / WNT / BMP — were involved in turning on the mesoderm marker BRACHYURY [ 85 ] . In such sys - tems , boundaries are created by differential display of signalling receptors at the colony edges while direct cell - cell contacts were essential for establishing diffusion - mediated cross - regulatory interactions to establish territories of differential marker expressions [ 86 – 88 ] . This gives rise to a pivotal question . Given the key invol - vement of the polar trophoblast in gastrulation induction in the mouse , how can this be reconciled with the loss of this very tissue in Rauber ’ s layer mammals or indeed in the more ancestral mammalian groups such as monotremes and marsupials in which no polar trophoblast ever forms ? The answer lies in the observation that in these species , the epithelialized epiblast disc establishes close contacts along its rim with the mural trophoblast ( figure 3 b ) . Thus a tropho - blast – epiblast border with reciprocal interactions can be established , with the difference that the edge of the mural tro - phoblast takes over the function of the polar trophoblast . In line with this interpretation , in cattle , the polar as well as the mural trophoblast immediately adjacent to it , express FURIN , one of the important convertases restricting NODAL activity to the epiblast - trophoblast border [ 26 , 89 ] . This is also the case in other Rauber ’ s layer species such as pigs , rabbits and the musk shrew ( order Eulipotyphla ) [ 35 ] . Indeed the progressive restriction of Nodal expression in the epiblast to the edge , as seen in the mouse , seems to be conserved in these four Rauber ’ s layer mammals which are representative of three different mammalian orders [ 26 , 35 , 90 , 91 ] . Whether BMP signalling is also involved in gas - trulation induction via the trophoblast – epiblast border is less clear , partly because there are several BMP paralogues ( BMP2 , 4 , 8a , 8b ) that could fulfil this function [ 26 , 35 , 52 , 92 ] . If we accept the premise that the trophoblast – epiblast border is involved in restricting gastrulation to the rim of the epiblast , it follows as a corollary that distancing of the polar trophoblast from the central ‘ non - rim ’ regions of the r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 377 : 2021025 4 5 epiblast may be necessary to prevent widespread reciprocal interactions . This prediction was recently shown to be correct in a typical Rauber ’ s layer species , namely in cattle [ 53 ] . The authors overexpressed BCL2 , thereby reducing apoptosis , which delayed Rauber ’ s layer disappearance by about a day . Intriguingly , this resulted in embryos ectopically expressing the primitive streak and mesoderm marker BRACHYURY in the epiblast , indicating the continuous presence , and thus sig - nalling of the polar trophoblast overlying the central epiblast , was incompatible with normal development ( figure 3 c ) . While the causative Rauber ’ s layer - epiblast signalling mechanism underlying the ectopic Brachyury induction was not deter - mined , it is likely to involve some combination of the NODAL , WNT and BMP pathways as overstimulation in the mouse of NODAL [ 93 ] , WNT [ 94 , 95 ] or BMP signalling [ 96 ] leads to ectopic BRACHYURY activation and / or supernumer - ary gastrulation initiation sites . In summary , the polar trophoblast / Rauber ’ s layer is able to communicate with the underlying epiblast , leading to gas - trulation initiation . In mice , the everted cup - shape of the epiblast distances and thus shields the central / distal epiblast from the reciprocal trophoblast – epiblast interactions that lead to gastrulation . In Rauber ’ s layer animals such as cattle , central epiblast shielding is automatically achieved as a con - sequence of removal of the polar trophoblast , again restricting trophoblast – epiblast interactions to the epiblast edge . Thus , paradoxically , the importance of Rauber ’ s layer lies in its disappearance . 5 . Loss of the polar trophoblast in relation to epiblast cavity formation This brings us to a new question : if the central epiblast needs to be shielded from interactions with the trophoblast , how is this achieved in mammals ( including humans ) that maintain the polar trophoblast , but which , unlike the mouse , do not form a cup - shaped epiblast ? A potential answer is that the epiblast cavitates ( first proposed in [ 53 ] ) . By forming a cavity within the epiblast , the floor of the cavity , corresponding to the central epiblast , would be shielded from the polar trophoblast by the roof of the cavity as well as by the physical separation pro - vided by the cavity itself . For this to be relevant requires that ( i ) cavitation is highly linked to polar trophoblast maintenance , ( ii ) cavitation is less well linked to alternative functions and ( iii ) cavitation can develop relatively easily , in line with the observation that a switch to polar trophoblast maintenance occurred repeatedly during evolution ( § 3 ) . ( a ) Is epiblast cavitation correlated with polar trophoblast maintenance ? Interestingly , cavitation of the epiblast is not seen in the monotreme and marsupial sister - groups of eutherian mam - mals nor is it a feature of the pluripotent layers in evolutionary more distant amniotes [ 4 , 97 – 99 ] . Furthermore , nearly all Rauber ’ s layer animals similarly do not form a cavity within the epiblast ( figure 2 ) and those that do , such as cattle and pigs , form only a transient cavity or multiple small spaces between epiblast cells , which appears to be required for the transition to an epithelialized epiblast [ 26 , 27 ] . In notable contrast , ALL species that maintain the polar trophoblast , form a prominent cavity within the epiblast ( figures 2 and 4 ) . ( b ) Is amniotic formation the primary driver for epiblast cavitation ? In many trophoblast - maintaining species , the purpose of epiblast cavitation has always been ascribed to amnion mouse wild - type Brachyury ectopic Brachyury RL maintained BCL2 - tg ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) cup - shaped flat A H A H epiblast PRONODAL NOD A L NOD A L polar trophoblast primed epiblast BMP4 WNT CERLEFTY Brachyury FURIN cattle Figure 3 .

( b ) Imaginary ‘ opening up ’ of the cup - shaped mouse - like embryo leads to a Rauber ’ s layer mammal - like flat epiblast ( disc shaped if seen from above ) . Note that the distal epiblast is distanced and thus shielded ( star ) from the signal ( double arrow ) at the border and corresponds to the central epiblast of the flattened embryo .

B 377 : 2021025 4 6 formation , because the roof of the epiblast cavity expands to eventually form the inner ectodermal layer of the amniotic sac that envelops and protects the fetus from mechanical shock [ 15 , 59 ] . This type of epiblast cavity is thus termed the amniotic cavity ( figure 1 ) . However , in other polar tropho - blast - maintaining species ( mainly bats and rodents ; see figures 1 and 2 ) a proamniotic cavity is formed as the roof cells of the initial epiblast cavity disappear , creating a cavity bounded by the epiblast ventrally and trophoblast dorsally . In these cases the true amniotic cavity is formed only after gas - trulation has commenced via a folding process involving the margin of the epiblast [ 59 , 100 ] . Indeed , the folding mode of amnion formation , which is also used by all Rauber ’ s layer mammals , is the ancestral one , and is also seen in non - placen - tal mammals , birds and reptiles [ 101 ] . We can thus infer that epiblast cavitation has been adapted in some polar - trophoblast maintaining mammals as an alternate means of amnion for - mation . Note that this is a derived feature , a repurposing of a process that had evolved for a different reason . ( c ) Forming a cavity in the epiblast : how adaptable is the process ? Epiblast cavitation seems to have evolved from an inherent ten - dency of many types of epithelial cells to require a basement membrane for their survival [ 102 – 106 ] . Thus cells distant from a laminin - expressing membrane have to either reposition themselves or die , which can cause spaces and lumens to appear depending on the shape of the epithelializing epiblast ( spheroid to flat ellipsoid ) . In humans and mice , central cav - ities are formed via a process termed hollowing that involves epitheloid epiblast cells organizing into radial rosettes followed by lumen formation [ 106 , 107 ] . Interestingly even embryonic stem cells in culture , embedded in a lamina - like matrix , exhibit this behaviour as they transit from a naive to a primed state [ 102 , 106 , 108 ] . In some bats ( Noctilionidae , Phyllostomidae ) the process is different . Small irregular spaces developing between epiblast cells coalesce , and extensive apoptosis is evi - dent [ 28 , 29 ] . Interestingly , hollowing as well as apoptosis were seen in mouse embryos that had been manipulated to have twice the normal size [ 109 ] . This indicates that embryos can use both modes of cavitation ( hollowing versus apoptosis ) somewhat interchangeably depending on their morphology , indicative of the adaptability of the process of cavitation . Cavitation is further adaptable as it is influenced not only by epiblast shape but also by the extent that the epiblast is covered by a laminin - containing basement membrane . In mammals , a basement membrane is formed between hypo - blast and epiblast , though usually not between epiblast and trophoblast [ 51 , 67 , 102 ] . Hence , species where the hypoblast surrounds most of a sphere - shaped mass of epiblast cells would be predisposed to form a central lumen / amniotic cavity . Examples are polar trophoblast maintaining species such as armadillos [ 40 ] , elephant and jumping shrews [ 39 , 49 ] , tenrecs [ 37 ] , colugos [ 12 ] and some bats of the Ptero - podidae , Phyllostomidae and Thyropteridae families [ 28 , 110 ] , where the hypoblast and lamina nearly completely envelop the epiblast ( figure 2 ) . Similarly in cultured human embryos laminin was seen to envelop the entire epiblast on day 8 , just before amniotic cavity formation [ 71 ] . An evolutionarily dis - tinct central lumen - generating variation is seen in rhesus macaque monkeys [ 9 ] , the California leaf - nosed bat ( Phyllos - tomidae ) [ 74 ] and Noctilionidae bats [ 28 ] , where a lamina additionally forms between some of the polar trophoblast and epiblast , thus extending the basal lamina beyond the hypoblast to encircle most of the epiblast , again resulting in amniotic cavity formation . On the other hand , in species where the epiblast is only partially covered , a central lumen might be expected to break through the non - covered side to form a proamniotic cavity . This is seen in several rodents ( e . g . mice , field voles ; figure 1 on right ) , where the hypoblast is stretched only A H amnioticcavity amnioticcavity no Rauber’s layer shielding via : examples : amnion forms by : signalling by : folding up edge of mural TB polar TB polar TB amnion all RL - species : primitive primates rabbits , squirrels treeshrew , carnivores pangolin , horse ruminants , pig true shrews , A fr . mole rodents : CastorimorphaMyomorphabats : Vespertilionoidea ( free - tailed and vesper bats ) new W . monkeys colugo afr . shrews , tenrec bats : NoctilionoideaOld W . fruit bats hedgehog old W . monkeys guinea pig armadillo guinea pig armadillo human folding in expansion expansion signal - free area recipr . signals proamnioticcavity trophoblast hypoblast epiblast Figure 4 . Methods of central epiblast shielding from extraembryonic ( polar trophoblast or amniotic ectoderm ) signals . It is proposed that central epiblast shielding can be achieved via removal of Rauber ’ s layer ( RL ) or by the distancing of the central epiblast by formation of a proamniotic or amniotic cavity . In the latter case the possibility of the amniotic ectoderm ( the roof of the epiblast cavity ) substituting for the polar trophoblast or edge of the mural trophoblast to induce signalling leading to gastrulation seems particularly likely for the indicated species . The inset shows a 9 - day old guinea pig embryo just prior to epiblast cavitation .

B 377 : 2021025 4 7 around the sides of the cup - shaped epiblast and the roof of the epiblast cup abuts the polar trophoblast with no basement membrane in between [ 14 , 111 ] . Conversely , no cavity is usually seen , nor would it be expected , in most Rauber ’ s layer mammals , which generally have a flatter epiblast and a membrane - less close apposition to the polar trophoblast ( § 3a ) . In this situation epiblast cells can simply rearrange into an epithelium or pseudostratified epi - thelium guided by the underlying hypoblast - epiblast basement membrane with transient irregular cavities or spaces rarely — and then only very transiently — merging into a central cavity . One interesting transitional case is the tree shrew Tupaia belan - gerie which is a Rauber ’ s layer species that has a near - spherical epiblast surrounded by hypoblast except for the dorsal side . During epithelialization this species develops a slit - like cavity in the centre at the same time that Rauber ’ s layer disintegrates [ 19 ] ( figure 2 ) . The epiblast subsequently flattens out . It can be concluded that cavitation could repeatedly arise in multiple mammalian species owing to : ( i ) the interchange - ability in the mechanisms of cavity formation ( apoptosis versus hollowing ) , and ( ii ) the multiple possibilities for adapting the epithelialization requirement for a lamina to generate a cavity , by modulating the shape of the epiblast and / or its membrane coverage . ( d ) A novel role for epiblast cavitation Based on the above discussion , I propose ( figure 4 ) that epi - blast cavity formation is a mammalian prerequisite not primarily for amnion formation or epiblast epithelialization , but to allow embryos to maintain their polar trophoblast , thereby allowing them to explore new modes of implantation . In other words , the requirement for central epiblast shielding is evolutionarily closely coupled to epiblast cavity formation . Given that some polar trophoblast - maintaining species dis - card the roof of the epiblast cavity — forming a proamniotic cavity instead of an amniotic cavity — a corollary is that the cavity per se , as opposed to the roof of the cavity , is sufficient for providing shielding from the overlying trophoblast . 6 . Variations on a theme — the amniotic ectoderm equivalence to the polar trophoblast The idea that Rauber ’ s layer disappearance and distancing of the polar trophoblast through epiblast cavitation simply rep - resent two alternative mechanisms for restricting trophoblast signalling to the edge of the epiblast builds on the concept that boundaries between different tissues are critical for patterning . The reciprocal interaction between the extraem - bryonic trophoblast and the embryonic epiblast with factors required by one tissue originating from the neighbouring tissue ensures that patterning effects are realised only near the boundary , within the diffusion range of the signalling molecules [ 112 , 113 ] . However , there are mammals in which the epiblast - trophoblast boundary may not be involved at all in setting up a gastrulation - inducing circuit . The best example of this may be the guinea pig , in which the sphere of epiblast cells becomes physically distanced from the polar trophoblast by proliferation of the hypoblast ( figure 4 ) . This separation occurs well before gastrulation commences ( figure 4 ) . In spite of the absence of adjoining trophoblast , epiblast cavita - tion occurs , thus contradicting the idea that cavitation functions to shield the central epiblast from persisting polar trophoblast and indeed the very notion that trophoblast is involved in gastrulation induction at all ! A second example of trophoblast epiblast distancing occurring well before gastrulation commences is seen in the nine - banded armadillo , where a precocious exocoelum devel - ops [ 76 ] . Mesenchymal cells of unknown origin line the inside of a cavity above the amniotic cavity — the outer walls of this cavity appear to be hypoblast as opposed to trophoblast ( figure 4 , rightmost ) . A less drastic situation can be seen in humans and cyno - molgus macaque monkeys where the hypoblast - derived extraembryonic mesenchymal cells interpose themselves between the ( amniotic ectodermal ) roof of the epiblast cavity and the polar ( cyto - ) trophoblast . In these instances , direct contact between trophoblast and epiblast may be broken before gastrulation can be induced ( figure 4 ) . The mechanistic details of gastrulation induction in these species need to be examined in more detail . Increasing evidence suggests that , at least in humans and old world monkeys ( Cercopithecidae ) , the roof of the amniotic cavity , comprising the amniotic ectoderm , can substitute for the polar trophoblast . The evidence supporting this idea is as follows : ( i ) the gene expression profile of the epiblast roof ( amniotic ectoderm ) is distinct from the primed / epithelialized epi - blast as shown in human and cynomolgus monkey pre - gastrulation embryos [ 71 , 114 ] . Thus the contact zone represents a bona fide boundary between alternative tissues ; ( ii ) the primate amniotic ectoderm resembles the mouse polar trophoblast . The mouse trophoblast stem cell markers CDX2 and GATA3 are expressed respectively in cynomolgus and human amniotic ectoderm [ 71 , 115 ] . Indeed , human trophoblast and amniotic cell identity have often been confused owing to a similar transcriptional profile [ 116 ] . Importantly , the NODAL activator FURIN is transcribed in human amniotic ecto - derm , as indicated in the electronic supplementary material , table S2 . 1 of Xiang et al . [ 71 ] . The second tro - phoblast signal important for gastrulation induction in the mouse , namely BMP4 , is expressed in the amniotic ectoderm of monkeys and humans [ 71 , 114 ] . Thus the amniotic ectoderm is in principle equipped to execute the reciprocal signalling shown to be important in the mouse polar trophoblast ; and ( iii ) the best evidence comes from an in vitro study , where human primed embryonic stem cells ( ES ) were first differentiated into amniotic ectoderm - like cells using BMP4 , then BMP4 was withdrawn and the cells mixed with undifferentiated ES cells and cultured for 2 days [ 117 ] . This led to the induction of gastrulation markers , including BRACHYURY . These authors were also able to coax ES cells into epiblast cysts which in the presence of exogenous BMP4 formed sacs consisting of dorsal amniotic ectoderm and ven - tral epiblast epithelium . Interestingly these structures always commenced gastrulation at the boundary between these tissues , indicating that the ‘ amniotic ’ cavity is sufficient to shield the central epiblast from gastrulation - inducing effects . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 377 : 2021025 4 8 Thus cavitation would still be required as a shielding mechanism but from the amniotic ectoderm instead of the polar trophoblast . 7 . Conclusion As mammals faced the selection pressures of alternative modes of implantation , they needed to adapt to novel requirements . The transition to close contact with the endo - metrium consequent to the loss of the egg shell may have necessitated the enclosing of the pluriblast within the tro - phoblast . However , the resulting apposition of the trophoblast with central epiblast presented a problem in terms of regulating the initiation of gastrulation . Two sol - utions to this are seen , to either lose the polar trophoblast again or to develop a cavity within the epiblast . Cavitation is a simple adaptation of inherent epithelialization processes coupled to epiblast shape and lamina coverage . Complete cavitation with the development of a persistent cavity roof allowed the secondment of the cavity roof in directly forming the amnion ( as opposed to the ancestral folding process ) as well as for gastrulation induction ( and germ cell formation ) .
