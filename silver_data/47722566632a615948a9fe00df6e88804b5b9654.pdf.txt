INTRODUCTION Two - dimensional melting has been intensively studied in the past years , but it is still not completely understood [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . Melting in two dimensions is quite diﬀerent from its counterpart in three dimensions , for a true long - range positional order doesn’t exist in two - dimensional systems . The absence of a conventional long - range order at non - zero temperature was ﬁrst pointed out by Mermin and Wagner [ 4 ] . Nevertheless , another long - range order , which is called the bond orientational order , can be observed in the solid phase [ 5 ] . There exist several possible theoretical descriptions of melting in two - dimensional sys - tems . The KTHNY theory , developed by Halperin , Nelson and Young [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] , predicts that a third phase , the so - called hexatic phase , may exist between solid and liquid states in a portion of the phase diagram . The system ﬁrst melts from the solid state to the hexatic state due to the unbinding of dislocation at a temperature T m , and then melts from the hexatic state to the liquid state at the disclination unbinding temperature T i . Both transitions are Kosterlitz - Thouless phase transitions [ 9 ] . Naturally , the KTHNY theory only describes a possible scenario . It is also possible that anyone or both of the continuous transitions are of ﬁrst order , and even that there is a direct ﬁrst - order transition from the solid state to the isotropic liquid state . Even though quite some experiments supported the KTHNY theory [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ] , most early works of computer simulations on two - dimensional melting favored a ﬁrst - order phase transition , and the hexatic phase was not observed . For example , for the systems with dipole - dipole interactions , Kalia and Vashishta [ 18 ] observed a superheating and supercooling , as well as a latent heat in two - dimensional melting , and concluded that the phase transition is of ﬁrst order . Later , Bedanov , Gadiyak and Lozovik [ 19 ] found that both the positional and bond orientational order vanished simultaneously at the melting point , and the hexatic phase didn’t exist . Similar results have been found for other systems [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ] . Even for the simplest system , the hard disk model , there was no consensus about the melting mechanism [ 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ] . In 1996 , Bagchi et al . [ 28 ] carried out a ﬁnite - size scaling analysis of the bond orientational order parameter in a system interacting via a repulsive 1 / r 12 potential , and found that the results were in agreement with the KTHNY theory , even though no conclusive evidence 2 for the hexatic phase was observed . Later , extensive Monte Carlo simulations of the hard disk model were performed by Jaster [ 29 , 30 ] . Numerical behaviors of the susceptibility , spatial bond orientational correlation length and pressure , support the KTHNY theory . But the algebraic decay of the bond orientational correlation function was still not shown [ 31 ] . Recently , Monte Carlo simulations of a two - dimensional electron system with a 1 / r interacting potential have been performed by He et al . [ 32 ] . An algebraic decay of the bond orientational correlation function is observed , and it explicitly reveals the existence of the hexatic phase . In principle , however , the ﬁnite - size eﬀect and coexistence of liquid and solid phases may also lead to such an algebraic decay . One needs to carefully rule out these possibilities . On the other hand , in all these numerical simulations of the bond orientational order , the static behavior of the melting is mainly concerned , and the dynamics is not touched so much . Recently , more progress in computer simulations has been made in understanding two - dimensional melting , for example , on the roles of the polydispersity [ 33 , 34 ] and exter - nal ﬁelds [ 35 ] , and on the structural change during the melting [ 36 ] . Especially , some experiments show much interest in a two - dimensional system with dipole - dipole interactions [ 17 , 37 ] . The algebraic decay of the spatial and temporal correlation functions are observed and the dynamic behavior is found to be very relevant for two - dimensional melting . From the view of numerical simulations , the two - dimensional system with dipole - dipole interactions is not much understood . The purpose of this article is to present systematic computer simula - tions of two - dimensional melting with dipole - dipole interactions . Main results are obtained with molecular dynamics simulations , and Monte Carlo simulations are also performed in some cases and for conﬁrmation . Both static and dynamic behavior will be examined , and an emphasis is given to the algebraic decay of both the spatial and temporal bond orientational correlation functions in the hexatic phase . The article is organized as follows . In Sec . II , the model and numerical methods will be described . In Sec . III , numerical results will be presented for both static and dynamic behavior . Finally it comes the conclusion . 3 II . MODEL AND METHOD A . The model In this article , we consider a two - dimensional dipolar system whose Hamiltonian can be written as H = N X i p 2 i µ i + 1 2 N X i = 1 N X j 6 = i { −→ m i · −→ m j | −→ r ij | 3 − 3 ( −→ m i · −→ r ij ) ( −→ m j · −→ r ij ) | −→ r ij | 5 } , ( 1 ) where p i , µ i and −→ m i are the momentum , mass and magnetization of the i th dipole respec - tively , and N is the total number of particles . In order to mimic the experiments in Refs . [ 17 , 37 ] and to simplify the problem , we assume the dipoles are aligned perpendicular to the surface . Thus , Eq . ( 1 ) can be reduced to H = N X i p 2 i µ i + 1 2 N X i = 1 N X j 6 = i m i m j | −→ r ij | 3 . ( 2 ) For convenience in numerical simulations , we rewrite Eq . ( 2 ) as H = N X i p 2 i µ + 1 2 N X i = 1 N X j 6 = i ǫ ( σ r ij ) 3 , ( 3 ) where we have assumed the mass and magnitude of the magnetization of the dipoles are identical . For simpliﬁcation , the reduced units are adopted , in which the parameters ǫ and σ , Boltzmann constant k B , and mass µ of the dipoles are set to 1 . The thermodynamic observables are determined only by a dimensionless constant Γ = ǫσ 3 ( πn ) 3 / 2 / kT [ 38 ] , where n = N / V is the 2 D volume fraction of the dipoles . The reasons we choose this model are : ( i ) this model lacks extensive numerical study , and the existing results do not favor the KTHNY theory ; ( ii ) there are unambiguous experimental results of such system [ 17 , 37 ] , to which we may compare our results . B . Numerical methods In our simulations , particles are put in a rectangular box with a size ratio 2 : √ 3 , the density of the particles is ﬁxed to be 1 / ( 2 √ 3 ) , and the number of the particles is taken to be from 1024 to 32768 . The linear size L of the system is related to the total number N of particles by L = 2 √ N . Periodic boundary conditions are used in simulations , and the dipole - dipole potential is truncated at 10 . In two dimensions , such a truncation is reasonable . 4 Actually , the correction of the potential to the truncation is u c = R 2 π 0 R + ∞ r c g ( r ) ǫ ( σr ) 3 rdrdθ ; assuming g ( r ) = 1 , it leads to u c = 2 πǫσ 3 / r c , which decays to zero with r c . In fact , the main parts of the simulations are carried out in the hexatic and liquid phases where g ( r ) quickly stabilizes at a constant which is smaller than 1 ( see Fig . 4 ( b ) ) . In order to conﬁrm the truncating procedure , we have performed the simulations at dif - ferent truncating distances , and ﬁnd that the diﬀerence is negligibly small . In addition , extra simulations using the Ewald Summation technique [ 39 , 40 ] , which is known for trans - ferring long - range interactions to short - range ones , are also performed to further justify our truncation . Within statistical errors , the results for the global bond orientational order pa - rameter Ψ 6 and susceptibility χ 6 obtained with diﬀerent truncating distances and the Ewald Summation are in good agreement with each other . Relevant data with L = 64 are compiled in table I for comparison . Additional simulations with L = 128 , and measurements of the pair distribution function g ( r ) also conﬁrm the reliability of the truncation . In this paper , most simulations are performed with molecular dynamics . All results are obtained at a constant temperature with the NV T ensemble based on the Nos´e - Hoover Chain thermostat [ 41 , 42 ] . The equation of the motion is solved via the ﬁve - point Nordsieck - Gear predictor - corrector method . The time step ∆ t in all the simulations is set to 0 . 01 . A shift of the conserved total energy is within 0 . 0001 % . The initial conﬁgurations in our simulations consist of particles uniformly distributed over the system box on a triangular lattice . Before collecting data for the measurements of physical observables , the system is carefully equilibrated , especially in the critical regime . We monitor the global bond orientational order parameter , and begin our measurement after this order parameter reaches a steady value . For the larger system ( N = 16384 ) , for example , it takes 5 × 10 5 time steps to thermalize the system . Only the conﬁgurations in equilibrium are used for the measurements of observables , extending over 9 × 10 6 time steps . In order to obtain independent conﬁgurations , the autocorrelation function of the global bond orientational order parameter is measured , and the correlation time is estimated to be τ ≈ 2400 time steps in the critical regime . Then the measurement is performed every 2500 time steps . In order to conﬁrm our molecular dynamics simulations , standard Monte Carlo simu - lations are additionally performed . For example , The bond orientational correlation func - tions from both molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo simulations are shown in 5 Fig . 1 ( a ) . Both methods provide consistent curves , and it shows that our molecular dy - namics simulations indeed generate proper ensemble distributions . Furthermore , dynamic Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to extract the critical exponents for the positional order parameter at the dislocation unbinding temperature T m . C . Observables The bond orientational symmetry of a solid can be described by the six - fold global bond orientational order parameter Ψ 6 deﬁned as Ψ 6 = h | 1 N N X k = 1 ψ 6 , k | i , ( 4 ) where N is the total number of the particles , h· · ·i denotes the ensemble average or the time average in molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo simulations , and the ψ 6 , k is the local bond orientational order parameter deﬁned as ψ 6 , k = 1 N k X j exp ( i 6 θ kj ) . ( 5 ) Here the sum j is over the neighbors of the particle k , and θ kj is the angle between −→ r kj ( the relative position vector of the particle k and j ) and an arbitrarily ﬁxed reference axis . Neigh - bors are obtained with the Voronoi polygon [ 43 ] . The susceptibility of the bond orientational order is deﬁned as χ 6 = N h Ψ 26 i . ( 6 ) The hexatic phase is characterized by an algebraic decay of the bond orientational cor - relation function deﬁned as g 6 ( −→ r 1 − −→ r 2 ) = h ψ ∗ 6 , k ( −→ r 1 ) ψ 6 , k ( −→ r 2 ) i . ( 7 ) In order to obtain an accurate value of the bond correlation length , we smooth the bond orientational correlation function following Ref . [ 30 ] . We divide the volume of the system into stripes with a width of ∆ x and measure the bond orientational correlation between diﬀerent stripes . g 6 ( x ) = h ( 1 N ( x ) Z L 0 d y ′ Z x + ∆ x / 2 x − ∆ x / 2 d x ′ ψ 6 , k ( −→ r ′ ) ) ∗ × ( 1 N ( 0 ) Z L 0 d y ′ Z ∆ x / 2 − ∆ x / 2 d x ′ ψ 6 , k ( −→ r ′ ) ) i , ( 8 ) 6 where N ( x ) = Z L 0 d y ′ Z x + ∆ x / 2 x − ∆ x / 2 d x ′ ρ ( −→ r ′ ) , ( 9 ) ρ ( −→ r ) = N X i = 1 δ ( −→ r − −→ r i ) , ( 10 ) and L is the linear size of the system in the y direction . The temporal bond orientational correlation function characterizes the time correlation of the bond orientational order pa - rameter , and is deﬁned as g 6 ( t ) = h ψ ∗ 6 , k ( t 0 ) ψ 6 , k ( t 0 + t ) i , ( 11 ) where ψ 6 , k ( t 0 ) and ψ 6 , k ( t 0 + t ) are the local bond orientational order parameters measure at the time t 0 and t 0 + t respectively , and the average is over t 0 in equilibrium . In the hexatic phase , g 6 ( t ) also decays by a power law [ 37 ] . The positional symmetry of solid can be described by a positional order parameter deﬁned as Ψ pos = h 1 N N X j = 1 exp ( i −→ G · −→ r j ) i , ( 12 ) where G is a reciprocal - lattice vector which gives the ﬁrst Bragg peak . In practice , we average the order parameter over the six reciprocal vectors which correspond to the six vectors connecting the six neighbors from the lattice site j . The positional correlation function is deﬁned as g G ( | −→ r − −→ r ′ | ) = h exp ( i −→ G · ( −→ r − −→ r ′ ) ) i . ( 13 ) In the hexatic phase , the positional correlation function decays exponentially . Finally , the pair distribution function is deﬁned as g ( r ) = V N 2 X i , j 6 = i δ ( −→ r − −→ r ij ) , ( 14 ) where V is the volume of the system . III . COMPUTER SIMULATION In this article , we perform extensive simulations of two - dimensional melting in the NV T ensemble with system sizes up to 32786 atoms , and ﬁnd a strong evidence for the existence of the hexatic phase in the dipole - dipole interacting system . We ﬁrst measure the spatial bond orientational correlation function and susceptibility in the isotropic liquid phase and 7 compare the results with the predictions of the KTHNY theory . This gives us estimates of the isotropic - anisotropic transition temperature T i . With this critical temperature in hand , we further scan the parameter space , and observe an algebraic decay of the spatial bond orientational correlation . We also measure the temporal bond orientational correlation function , and its behavior is in good agreement with the KTHNY theory . In order to rule out a possible coexistence phase and the ﬁnite - size eﬀect , we perform a homogeneous test and ﬁnite - size scaling analysis of the bond orientational order parameter . The result is compatible with previous measurements . At last , with Monte Carlo methods we simulate the short - time dynamics of the positional order and estimate the exponent η m , and the value is also in agreement with the theoretical prediction . All our results are compatible with the experiments and KTHNY theory , and the hexatic phase is explicitly observed . A . Bond orientational order The bond orientational order parameter Ψ 6 oﬀers a direct description of the bond orienta - tional order [ 23 ] . Assuming T i is the transition temperature of the bond orientational order and T m is the transition temperature of the positional order , the bond orientational order parameter should vanish for T > T i . and take a ﬁnite value less than 1 for T < T m . The behavior of Ψ 6 at the temperatures between T i and T m depends on the underlying melting scenario . If the transition at T i is of ﬁrst order , Ψ 6 increases linearly from T i to T m . If the melting scenario is of KTHNY , i . e . , the transition at T i is a Kosterlitz - Thouless phase transtion , Ψ 6 then vanishes throughout the hexatic phase for there doesn’t exist a true long - range bond orientational order . However , the ﬁnite - size eﬀect in the simulations blurs this distinction and prevents us drawing a clear conclusion . Nevertheless , the measurement of the bond orientational order parameter Ψ 6 does give us an estimated value of T i ≈ 0 . 01250 . In the Fig . 1 ( b ) , Ψ 6 versus T is shown . To further understand the phase transition at T i , we measure the correlation length and susceptibility of the bond orientational order parameter in the isotropic liquid phase for diﬀerent temperature T . For the measurements are carried out in the isotropic liquid phase , the spatial bond orientational correlation function is independent of the spatial directions . We extract the correlation length ξ from the exponential decay of the bond orientational 8 correlation function smoothed with the technique described in Eq . ( 8 ) , g 6 ( x ) ∼ exp ( − x / ξ ) . ( 15 ) Subsequently , we compare our results with the predictions of the KTHNY theory , i . e . , an exponential singularity of the correlation length and susceptibility , ξ 6 ( τ ) = a ξ exp ( b ξ τ − 1 / 2 ) , ( 16 ) χ 6 ( τ ) = a χ exp ( b χ τ − 1 / 2 ) , ( 17 ) as τ = T − T i → 0 + . In Fig . 2 , the numerical data are ﬁtted to the above exponential forms . The best ﬁt of the correlation length and susceptibility gives T i = 0 . 01237 ( 16 ) and T i = 0 . 01243 ( 4 ) respectively . These two values are in agreement with each other within statistical errors , and are also consistent with the previous estimated value of T i from the global bond orientational order parameter . Therefore , our results support the KTHNY prediction , even though the statistical errors of the correlation length and susceptibility are relatively large . B . The hexatic phase According to the KTHNY theory , the hexatic phase is characterized by an algebraic decay of the bond orientational correlation function and an exponential decay of the positional correlation function . Therefore , we scan the parameter space between T i and T m , and measure the bond orientational correlation function and positional correlation function . The bond orientational correlation function is shown in Fig . 3 ( a ) . A clear evidence for the existence of the hexatic phase is observed . i ) In the solid phase ( T = 0 . 0119 ) , the correlation function rapidly stabilizes to a constant , and it indicates that there is a true long - range order of the bond orientational symmetry . ii ) In the hexatic phase ( T = 0 . 01252 and 0 . 01253 ) , the correlation function shows an algebraic decay , g 6 ( x ) ∼ x − η 6 , ( 18 ) and it indicates that there is a quasi - long - range order of the bond orientational symmetry . iii ) In the liquid phase ( T = 0 . 0127 ) , the correlation function decays exponentially , and it indicates an isotropic state . 9 After smoothing the correlation function at T = 0 . 01253 , we obtain an exponent η 6 = 0 . 252 ( 6 ) from the slope of the curve , and it is close to the value η 6 = 0 . 25 at the transition temperature T i predicted by the KTHNY theory . If we assume T = 0 . 01253 is just the transition temperature T i , it is quantitatively in agreement with the previous measurements in the preceding subsection . Nevertheless , to obtain a more accurate value of T i , we need to consider more carefully the ﬁnite - size eﬀect . In the next subsection , we will locate the transition temperature from the ﬁnite - size scaling . In Fig . 4 , the positional correlation function and pair distribution function are shown respectively . One may observe two diﬀerent behaviors . i ) In the solid phase ( T i = 0 . 0119 ) , the positional correlation function shows an algebraic decay , indicating a quasi - long - range positional order in a two - dimensional solid , while the oscillation in the pair distribution function persists over the entire range . ii ) In the hexatic phase ( T i = 0 . 01253 ) , the positional correlation function decays quickly to zero , indicating that there exists no positional order in the hexatic phase , and the os - cillation in the pair distribution function dies oﬀ rapidly . The behaviors of the positional correlation function and pair distribution function in the liquid phase are qualitatively the same as in the hexatic phase . The recent experiment reported in Ref . [ 37 ] shows that the dynamic behavior is also very important in understanding the melting mechanism in two dimensions . According to the KTHNY theory , in the solid phase the temporal bond orientation correlation function will rapidly stabilize to a constant , in the hexatic phase it shows an algebraic decay with an exponent equal to η 6 / 2 , g 6 ( t ) ∼ t − η 6 / 2 , ( 19 ) and in the liquid phase the temporal correlation function decays exponentially [ 44 ] . Such a behavior is indeed observed in experiments , and it provides a strong evidence for the exis - tence of the hexatic phase . To our knowledge , such measurements have not been performed in numerical simulations . In order to deepen our understanding of two - dimensional melting and further conﬁrm our observation in numerical simulations of static properties , the temporal bond orienta - tion correlation function is measured in our molecular dynamics simulations . The result is shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) . Obviously , as the temperature changes from T = 0 . 0119 to 0 . 01253 , then to 0 . 0131 , the temporal bond orientation correlation function follows the prediction of 10 the KTHNY theory , and are well consistent with the experimental observation [ 37 ] . The exponent measured from the slope of the curve at T = 0 . 01253 is 0 . 0843 , somewhat smaller than the theoretical prediction 0 . 125 at T i . This probably suggests that the anisotropic - isotropic transition temperature T i should be still slightly above the value 0 . 01253 , and our measurements of the spatial and temporal bond orientational correlation functions may still carry certain ﬁnite - size eﬀects . C . Finite - size scaling analysis Our measurements of the spatial and temporal bond correlation functions provide us an explicit evidence for the existence of the hexatic phase in two - dimensional melting . However , it is diﬃcult to extract an accurate transition temperature T i from the correlations functions . One may directly measure the correlation length in the isotropic liquid phase and then ﬁt the data to the ansatz in Eq . ( 16 ) and obtain the transition temperature T i . But this approach also suﬀers from the diﬃculty that one can not obtain the correlation length at the temperatures very close to T i [ 45 , 46 ] . Meanwhile , due to the ﬁnite - size eﬀect , distinguishing between an algebraic and an exponential decay might be problematic if the correlation length is ﬁnite but much larger than the system size . Therefore , to extract a more accurate disclination unbinding temperature T i and to conﬁrm the previous observation of the hexatic phase , we perform a ﬁnite - size scaling analysis of the bond orientational order parameter . From the ﬁnite - size scaling form , the second moment of the bond orientational order parameter can be written as h Ψ 26 i ∼ L − η 6 f ( L / ξ 6 ) , ( 20 ) where L = 2 √ N is the linear size of the system and ξ 6 is the bond correlation length . Since ξ 6 is divergent in the hexatic phase , h Ψ 26 i thus shows a power - law behavior with respect to L in the hexatic phase . In the liquid phase , the power - law behavior will be modiﬁed by the scaling function f ( L / ξ 6 ) . We measure the second moment of global bond orientational order parameter with system size L = 64 , 128 , 256 at T = 0 . 01257 and perform ﬁnite - size scaling analysis mentioned above . The open circles shown in Fig . 5 are the results . In order to save computation time , we use the subsystem method introduced by the authors of Refs . [ 23 , 28 ] . Here , a brief 11 comment about the above non - standard ﬁnite - size scaling analysis is needed . In principle , the subsystem procedure still carries a second - order ﬁnite - size eﬀect induced by the ﬁnite bulk system size L . But this second - order ﬁnite - size eﬀect is negligibly small in practical simulations [ 23 ] , and the procedure has been proved to be reliable and may reduce computer times [ 28 ] . We also carried out the ﬁnite - size scaling analysis using subsystem method at T = 0 . 01257 to further justify this procedure , the result is shown in Fig . 5 . It is easy to observe that within statistical errors , the data with periodic boundary conditions and from subsystems are well consistent . With the subsystem method , we measure h Ψ 26 i at diﬀerent temperatures with a bulk linear size L = 256 or 512 , and a total number of particles ranging from N = 16384 to 32768 . Then the system is divided into small subsystems with a linear size L S [ 23 ] and the bond orientational order parameter of each subsystem is measured . The result is shown in Fig . 5 . To locate T i , we assume η 6 = 1 / 4 . In other words , we search for a temperature which yields η 6 = 1 / 4 , and then assign this temperature to be T i . The requirement of η 6 = 1 / 4 yields the upper limit of T i [ 44 ] . Combining the results obtained in the preceding subsections , we conclude 0 . 01253 < T i < 0 . 01257 . To compare our results with those in literatures , we convert T i to the dimensionless parameter Γ i , and obtain 68 . 707 < Γ i < 68 . 927 . It improves the values T i = 62 ± 3 with a small system N = 256 [ 18 ] and T i = 67 . 750 with a relatively larger system N = 961 [ 47 ] . In Refs . [ 18 , 47 ] , the phase transition is supposed to be of ﬁrst order , and the values of T i are obtained from the hysteresis in the temperature dependence of energy , the existence of latent heat and the thermodynamic nucleation of the solid from the supercooled liquid . Our estimate of T i is based on the KTHNY theory , and is much less aﬀected by the ﬁnite - size eﬀect . D . Ruling out the coexistence phase In principle , the NV T molecular dynamics simulation can not obviate the coexistence phase , and the superposition of the solid and liquid phases may also produce the hexatic - like behavior . In order to exclude this possibility , we apply the homogeneous test . We divide the system into small subsystems and compute the susceptibility χ 6 for all subsystems [ 21 ] . If the system exhibits an inhomogeneous two - phase coexistence , the probability distribution of χ 6 at a suﬃciently small length scale could be modeled by a curve with two peaks , which 12 reﬂects a combination of solid and ﬂuid distributions . On the other hand , if the system is homogeneous , varying the size of the subsystems should not lead to any qualitative change in the probability distribution of χ 6 , i . e . , the curve should always remain with a single peak . We have measured the possibility distribution of χ 6 in the hexatic phase at T = 0 . 01257 , 0 . 01253 , 0 . 01252 , and in order to compare the result with that in the homogeneous phase , we also perform a simulation at an extra temperature T = 0 . 0100 corresponding to the cool solid phase . No qualitatively change is found at these temperatures . This test rules out the existence of a coexistence phase , and conﬁrms the observation of the hexatic phase in the previous subsections . The result at T = 0 . 01252 is shown in Fig . 6 . It is clearly seen that varying the system size doesn’t change the shape of distributions , but only shifts the peak of the probability distribution . E . Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations In the last decade , it has been discovered that already in a macroscopic short - time regime emerges the universal scaling behavior [ 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 ] . Measurements now are carried out at the early stage of the time evolution , therefore one does not suﬀer from critical showing down . The dynamic scaling form of the second moment of the positional order parameter below the dislocation unbinding transition temperature T m is Ψ 2 pos ( t , L ) = b − η m Ψ 2 pos ( b − z t , b − 1 L ) , ( 21 ) where t is the evolution time , z is the dynamic critical exponent , and b is an arbitrary rescaling factor . For a suﬃcient large L , this dynamic scaling form is reduced to Ψ 2 pos ( t ) ∼ t − η m / z . ( 22 ) From a ﬁnite - size scaling analysis of the time - dependent Binder cumulant [ 48 ] U pos ( t ) = Ψ 4 pos ( Ψ 2 pos ) 2 − 1 , ( 23 ) one obtains U pos ( t ) ∼ t d / z / L d , ( 24 ) where d is the dimension of the system . The dynamic critical exponent z can be estimated from Eq . ( 24 ) , and with z in hand , the static exponent η m can be obtained from Eq . ( 22 ) . 13 Now , we turn to locate the transition temperature T m . As the temperature increases , T m is characterized by the dislocation unbinding which breaks the quasi - long - range posi - tional symmetry . Therefore , one may measure the correlation function of the positional order parameter to estimate T m , for the positional correlation become short - range at T m . Nevertheless , this method suﬀers from the diﬃculty that one needs to do simulations in the critical region . Even for the hard disk model , in which the thermodynamic quantities are only determined by the density ρ of disks , it is still not easy to locate ρ m accurately . ρ m ≈ 0 . 933 is reported in Ref . [ 50 ] , while ρ m = 0 . 910 ( 2 ) is given in Ref . [ 52 ] . Alternatively , a dynamic technique for locating T m is applied in the experiments reported in Ref . [ 37 ] . In our computer simulations , we follow Ref . [ 37 ] and adopt the dynamic criterion for T m , since the method is relatively simple , and may provide direct comparison with experiments . We ﬁrst introduce the 2 D Lindemann parameter [ 17 , 53 ] γ m = h | −→ u ( −→ r + −→ a 0 ) − −→ u ( −→ r ) | 2 i × πn , ( 25 ) where −→ a 0 is the lattice spacing vector , −→ r is the positional vector , −→ u is the displacement ﬁeld and n is the 2 D volume fraction of particles . Initially , the system is set on a perfect trian - gular lattice . In numerical simulations , we gradually warm up the system with the velocity rescaling procedure . At each T , the system is equilibrated to the thermal equilibrium . Then we measure the Lindemann parameter at diﬀerent temperatures . In general , a sharp growth of γ m indicates vanishing of the positional symmetry . Such a Lindemann criterion in 3 D systems is a well - established and justiﬁed procedure for locating the melting temperature T m , although it was unclear in two dimensions [ 4 ] . In 1985 , Bedanov and Gadiyak improved the deﬁnition of the Lindemann parameter to the form in Eq . ( 25 ) and demonstrated in the simulations of electron and dipole systems that when γ m rises up to a critical value 0 . 12 , the melting takes place [ 53 ] . At the melting point T m , which is more clearly identiﬁed by the sudden drop of the positional correlation length , a sharp growth of γ m is induced by the leap of disclination number and self - diﬀusion constant . Therefore , this local quantity is relevant to the melting . Recently , Zahn et al . applied this criterion to their experiments [ 17 , 37 ] , and the results are in agreement with those from numerical simulations [ 53 ] . The Lindemann parameter may provide at least a ﬁrst estimate of the melting temperature T m . Due to its eﬃciency and simplicity , the Lindemann criterion has been applied to diﬀerent systems for locating the melting point [ 54 , 55 , 56 ] . 14 Here we locate T m with the Lindemann criterion . Four runs are performed in order to estimate T m . One of them is shown in Fig . 7 . We estimate T m = 0 . 0120 ( 2 ) . The hexatic phase of the dipolar system lies in a range of the phase diagram , between 0 . 01253 < T i < 0 . 01257 and T m = 0 . 0120 ( 2 ) . This is comparable with that of the hard disk model , ρ i = 0 . 899 ( 1 ) [ 30 ] , and ρ m ≈ 0 . 933 in Ref . [ 50 ] while ρ m = 0 . 910 ( 2 ) in Ref . [ 52 ] . T i and T m may overlap for small systems , and this is one reason why the hexatic phase was not observed in some previous studies . Now we perform dynamic Monte Carlo simulations at the transition temperature T m . The reason we perform Monte Carlo simulations is that the dynamic scaling forms in Eqs . ( 22 ) and ( 24 ) may not hold in the dynamic process of Nos´e - Hoover chain molecular dy - namics simulations . It seems that the Nos´e - Hoover Chain method is originally devised for equilibrium simulations and contains techniques violating the dynamic scaling behavior . In comparison to this , the dynamic scaling behavior in Monte Carlo simulations has been extensively justiﬁed . In Monte Carlo simulations , the system initially at an ordered state is released to the dynamic evolution with the Metropolis algorithm , and then the time - dependent Ψ 2 pos and U pos are measured . By ﬁtting Ψ 2 pos ( t ) and U pos ( t ) to Eqs . ( 22 ) and ( 24 ) , both the dynamic exponent z and static exponent η m can be determined . For comparison , we also perform the same simulations at another temperature T = 0 . 0115 . The results are shown in Fig . 8 ( a ) and ( b ) . From U pos ( t ) in Fig . 8 ( b ) , we estimate z = 1 . 910 ( 70 ) , and from Ψ 2 pos ( t ) in Fig . 8 ( a ) , we measure η m / z = 0 . 143 ( 5 ) . Combining these results , we deduce η m = 0 . 273 ( 20 ) . This value is also in agreement with the prediction ( 1 / 4 ≤ η m ≤ 1 / 3 ) based on the KTHNY theory [ 1 ] . IV . CONCLUSION We present molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of two - dimensional melting with dipole - dipole interactions . An algebraic decay is observed for both the spatial and temporal bond orientational correlation functions in an intermediate temperature regime , and this serves as an explicit evidence for the existence of the hexatic phase . To obtain a relatively accurate disclination unbinding temperature T i , we perform a ﬁnite - 15 size scaling analysis for the bond orientational order parameter . The result 0 . 01253 < T i < 0 . 01257 improves the value from a direct ﬁt of the correlation length to the exponential ansatz . In addition , by analyzing the probability distribution of the bond orientational susceptibility χ 6 , a possible coexistence phase is ruled out . At last , from dynamic behavior of the Lindemann parameter , the dislocation unbinding transition temperature is estimated to be T m = 0 . 0120 ( 2 ) . We also perform dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of the positional order parameter and the time - dependent cumulant . From the power - law behavior of these quantities , we determine the exponents η m = 0 . 273 ( 20 ) and z = 1 . 910 ( 70 ) . In summary , a clear evidence for the existence of the hexatic phase is observed for two - dimensional melting with dipole - dipole interactions , and all the static and dynamic behaviors of the system are compatible with recent experiments and the KTHNY theory .
