CritiCal Care MediCine ANESTHESIOLOGY , V 130 • NO 5 MAY 2019 767 I n patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , mechanical ventilation with high tidal volume ( V T ) pro - motes ventilator - induced lung injury and has been recog - nized as a major risk factor for organ failure and death . 1 , 2 High V T as well as static ( positive end - expiratory pressure [ PEEP ] , respiratory system plateau pressure , driving pressure ( ΔP , RS ] ) 3 and dynamic parameters ( respiratory rate [ RR ] , 4 inspiratory 5 and expiratory 6 peak flow ) have been implicated in venti - lator - induced lung injury causation . However , most inves - tigations of ventilator - induced lung injury have focused on the static characteristics of the individual tidal cycle , 7 whereas the dynamic characteristics and consequences of repetition intensity have been somewhat overlooked . 8 The knowledge that both dynamic and static respiratory variables may be injurious has led to the concept of damaging mechanical power transferred from the ventilator to the lungs . 9 , 10 Along this line , the absolute value of power itself is not the defining characteristic associated with ventilator - induced lung injury ; its hazard is conditioned by the maximum tidal strain associ - ated with that power level . 11 – 13 aBStraCt Background : This study hypothesized that , in experimental mild acute respiratory distress syndrome , lung damage caused by high tidal volume ( V T ) could be attenuated if V T increased slowly enough to progressively reduce mechanical heterogeneity and to allow the epithelial and endothelial cells , as well as the extracellular matrix of the lung to adapt . For this purpose , different strategies of approaching maximal V T were tested . Methods : Sixty - four Wistar rats received Escherichia coli lipopolysaccha - ride intratracheally . After 24 h , animals were randomly assigned to receive mechanical ventilation with V T = 6 ml / kg for 2 h ( control ) ; V T = 6 ml / kg during hour 1 followed by an abrupt increase to V T = 22 ml / kg during hour 2 ( no adaptation time ) ; V T = 6 ml / kg during the first 30 min followed by a gradual V T increase up to 22 ml / kg for 30 min , then constant V T = 22 ml / kg during hour 2 ( shorter adaptation time ) ; and a more gradual V T increase , from 6 to 22 ml / kg during hour 1 followed by V T = 22 ml / kg during hour 2 ( longer adapta - tion time ) . All animals were ventilated with positive end - expiratory pressure of 3 cm H 2 O . Nonventilated animals were used for molecular biology analysis . results : At 2 h , diffuse alveolar damage score and heterogeneity index were greater in the longer adaptation time group than in the control and shorter adaptation time animals . Gene expression of interleukin - 6 favored the shorter ( median [ interquartile range ] , 12 . 4 [ 9 . 1 – 17 . 8 ] ) adaptation time compared with longer ( 76 . 7 [ 20 . 8 to 95 . 4 ] ; P = 0 . 02 ) and no adaptation ( 65 . 5 [ 18 . 1 to 129 . 4 ] ) time ( P = 0 . 02 ) strategies . Amphiregulin , metalloproteinase - 9 , club cell secretory protein - 16 , and syndecan showed similar behavior . Conclusions : In experimental mild acute respiratory distress syndrome , lung damage in the shorter adaptation time group compared with the no adap - tation time group was attenuated in a time - dependent fashion by preemptive adaptation of the alveolar epithelial cells and extracellular matrix . Extending the adaptation period increased cumulative power and did not prevent lung damage , because it may have exposed animals to injurious strain earlier and for a longer time , thereby negating any adaptive benefit .

CritiCal Care MediCine For the individual patient , the stress and strain thresholds required to induce ventilator - induced lung injury are still unknown . They likely depend on the components and orga - nization of the extracellular matrix , as well as on the preex - isting degrees of epithelial and endothelial cell injury . 14 In acutely injured lungs , stepwise increases in V T begin to cause damage when strain exceeds a critical level ; injury is inten - sified with repetition of excessive stress . 11 , 15 In heteroge - neous lungs with varying regional aeration , tidal energy can concentrate on a small mass of pulmonary tissue , produc - ing , aggravating , or propagating lung injury with successive cycles . Nevertheless , when tidal strain is higher than normal but kept below this critical damage threshold , injury may be prevented , delayed , 16 or even quickly repaired . 17 In the clinical setting and in virtually all laboratory experiments to date , changes in V T are usually applied abruptly . However , both normal and preinjured lungs behave as a viscoelastic sys - tem 18 in which elements of the extracellular matrix require an adaptive “stress relaxation” time to mitigate the damaging strain associated with large tidal excursions . These internal adjustments occur over both short and extended time scales , 18 depending on the degree of lung injury . Based on the foregoing , we hypothesized that lung dam - age caused by an abrupt increase in V T would be attenu - ated if V T were increased slowly enough to reduce alveolar mechanical heterogeneity and to allow the epithelium , endothelium , and extracellular matrix to adapt to the ultimate high tidal volume level . To our knowledge , this intriguing possibility has not been investigated previously , and the time course of any adaptive potential has not been determined . Thus , the present study aimed to compare the nature and severity of lung damage incurred by different strategies of V T increase : abrupt ( no adaptation time ) , grad - ual ( shorter adaptation time ) , and even more gradual ( longer adaptation time ) . For this purpose , lung function , heteroge - neity index , diffuse alveolar damage score , and expression of genes related to inflammation , alveolar stretch , epithelial and endothelial cell injuries , and extracellular matrix dam - age were evaluated in a rodent model of mild ARDS . Materials and Methods This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Health Sciences Center , Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( Comissão de Ética no Uso de Animais 086 / 17 ) . The present study followed the ARRIVE guidelines for report - ing of animal research . 19 Detailed methods are described in Supplemental Digital Content 1 ( http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B863 ) . Animal Preparation and Experimental Protocol Sixty - four male Wistar rats ( weight 376 ± 52 g ) received Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide ( 200 µg ) intratracheally to induce ARDS . 20 At 24 h , 32 animals were anesthetized , par - alyzed , and mechanically ventilated ( V500 ; Dräger Medical , Germany ) in volume - controlled mode with V T = 6 ml / kg , PEEP = 3 cm H 2 O , RR adjusted to Paco 2 = 35 to 45 mmHg , and fraction of inspired oxygen = 0 . 4 ( fig . 1 ) . They were then randomly assigned to receive one of four ventilation strategies ( n = 8 / group ) : mechanical ventilation with pro - tective strategy ( V T = 6 ml / kg ) for 2 h ( control ) ; V T = 6 ml / kg during hour 1 followed by constant V T = 22 ml / kg ( high tidal volume ) until a 2 - h period was complete ( no adaptation time ) ; V T = 6 ml / kg during the first 30 min followed by a gradual slow V T ( 0 . 5 ml · kg −1 · min −1 ) increase up to 22 ml / kg for 30 min , then constant V T = 22 ml / kg during hour 2 ( shorter adaptation time ) ; and a more gradual V T increase from 6 to 22 ml / kg ( 0 . 25 ml · kg −1 · min −1 ) during hour 1 followed by constant V T = 22 ml / kg during hour 2 ( longer adaptation time ) . The V T size of 22 ml / kg was chosen because it has been shown to promote ventilator - induced lung injury and yet allow survival for 2 h in this rodent model . 21 The gradual increases in V T were done manually ( fig . 1 ) . Eight nonventilated animals served for comparison purposes in our molecular biology analyses ( n = 8 ) . Arterial blood gases and respiratory mechanics were measured . At the experi - ment’s end , the animals were euthanized , and their lungs were extracted for histologic and molecular biology analysis . To dissociate the effects of gradually increasing V T from those of longer exposure to higher tidal volumes , we also evaluated the effects of these mechanical ventilation strat - egies at 1 h . For this purpose , 24 animals were ventilated in control , shorter adaptation time , and longer adaptation time groups ( n = 8 / group ) and euthanized at 1 h . Heterogeneity index , diffuse alveolar damage score , and gene expression of biomarkers were then measured . Echocardiography Left ventricular ejection fraction , cardiac output , heart rate , and the ratio between pulmonary acceleration time and pulmonary ejection time ( an indirect index of pulmonary arterial hypertension ) were measured . Data Acquisition and Processing Airflow , airway ( P aw ) , esophageal ( P es ) , and transpulmonary ( P , L ) pressures were measured 22 every 30 min . Respiratory system ( ΔP , RS ) and transpulmonary ( ΔP , L ) driving pressures were calculated . Cumulative power exposure 12 , 13 was calcu - lated at 1 and 2 h . Histology Slices ( 4 μm thick ) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . The diffuse alveolar damage score was quanti - fied 23 as was the heterogeneity index ( β ) . 24 , 25 Biologic Markers The mRNA expression of interleukin - 6 , amphiregulin , 26 club cell secretory protein - 16 , vascular cell adhesion Copyright © 2019 , the American Society of Anesthesiologists , Inc .

CritiCal Care MediCine molecule - 1 , syndecan - 1 27 , metalloproteinase - 9 , 28 and decorin 29 in lung tissue was measured by reverse tran - scriptase - polymerase chain reactions . Primer sequences are listed in table 1 in Supplemental Digital Content 2 ( http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B865 ) . Each gene expres - sion was normalized to the housekeeping gene acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 ( 36B4 ) and expressed as fold change relative to nonventilated animals , using the 2 – ΔΔCt method , where ΔCt = Ct ( target gene ) – Ct ( reference gene ) . 30 Statistical Analysis Sample size calculation is provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1 ( http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B863 ) . The pri - mary outcome was the difference in gene expression of interleukin - 6 among ventilator strategies , whereas the sec - ondary outcomes were lung function , heterogeneity index , diffuse alveolar damage score , and expression of genes related to alveolar stretch , epithelial and endothelial cell injuries , and extracellular matrix damage . Functional and echocardiographic parameters were compared between groups and over time using a mixed linear model based on a random intercept for each ani - mal followed by Bonferroni’s test . Molecular parameters and diffuse alveolar damage scores were assessed with the Kruskal – Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test . The mixed linear models were constructed in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows , version 19 . 0 ( IBM Corp . , USA ) . All other tests were performed in GraphPad Prism version 6 . 00 ( GraphPad Software , USA ) . Significance was established at P < 0 . 05 . results All animals survived to the end of the experiment ( final time ) ; thus , there were no missing data of any kind . Mean arterial pressure remained at or above 70 mmHg throughout the experiments . At the final time , no statistically significant differences among groups were observed in the volume of fluids required to keep mean arterial pressure at or above 70 mmHg ( control , 13 . 1 ± 3 . 3 ml ; no adaptation time , 13 . 6 ± 2 . 5 ml ; shorter adaptation time : 10 . 3 ± 2 . 0 ml ; longer adapta - tion time , 11 . 5 ± 2 . 7 ml ) . Oxygenation increased over time in the following groups : no adaptation , shorter adaptation time , and longer adaptation time . At the final time , oxygen - ation was higher in the no adaptation and shorter adapta - tion time groups than in control . In the no adaptation and shorter adaptation time groups , Paco 2 declined during the course of mechanical ventilation and was lower in the shorter adaptation and longer adaptation time groups compared with control ( table 2 in Supplemental Digital Content 3 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B866 ) . V T increased as RR was adjusted , according to our experimental protocol , which targeted a constant minute ventilation ( table 3 in Supple men - tal Digital Content 4 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B867 ) . Respiratory system plateau pressure , ΔP , L , Energy , L and Power , L increased over time in the no adaptation , shorter adaptation time , and Longer adaptation time groups ( table 1 ) . Cumulative power was greater in the longer adap - tation time group than in the other groups at 2 h ( fig . 1 in Supplemental Digital Content 5 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B864 ; fig . 2 in Supplemental Digital Content 6 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B868 ) and 1 h ( fig . 3 in Supplemental Digital Content 7 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B869 ) . At 2 h , the diffuse alveolar damage score , which rep - resents the severity of atelectasis , ductal overdistension , interstitial edema , inflammation , and airway detachment , was increased in the longer adaptation time group compared with the control and shorter adaptation time groups due to statistically significant increases in atelectasis , interstitial edema , and detachment of airway epithelium ( table 2 ; fig . 4 in Supplemental Digital Content 8 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B870 ) . At 1 h , diffuse alveolar damage was higher in the longer adaptation time group than in the control and shorter adaptation time groups ( fig . 5 in Supplemental Digital Content 9 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B871 ; table 4 in Supplemental Digital Content 10 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B872 ) . Heterogeneity index ( β ) was greater in the longer adap - tation time group than in the control and shorter adaptation time groups at 2 h ( fig . 2 ) and at 1 h ( fig . 6 in Supplemental Digital Content 11 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B873 ) . Gene expression of biomarkers associated with inflam - mation ( interleukin - 6 ) , mechanical pulmonary stretch ( amphiregulin ) , and extracellular matrix damage ( metallo - proteinase - 9 ) in lung tissue were greater in the no adap - tation and longer adaptation time groups compared with both the control and shorter adaptation time groups ( fig . 3 ) . Gene expression of club cell secretory protein - 16 ( marker associated with epithelial cell damage ) was greater in the longer adaptation group than in the shorter adap - tation time group and decreased in the shorter adaptation time group as compared with the no adaptation time group . Gene expression of syndecan ( marker associated with extra - cellular matrix connection to epithelial cells ) was greater in the no adaptation time group than in control animals and reduced in longer adaptation and shorter adaptation time groups compared with the no adaptation time group . Decorin ( marker associated with fibrosis ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( marker associated with endothelial cell damage ) expression did not differ among groups ( fig . 7 in Supplemental Digital Content 12 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B874 ) . At 1 h , interleukin - 6 expression was increased in the longer adaptation time group compared with the control and shorter adaptation time groups . Club cell secretory protein - 16 , metalloproteinase - 9 , syndecan , decorin , and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expressions did not differ among groups ( fig . 8 in Supplemental Digital Content 13 , http : / / links . lww . com / ALN / B875 ) .

CritiCal Care MediCine attenuated lung injury , likely by preemptive adaptation of the epithelial cells and extracellular matrix . However , a more gradual increase in V T ( longer adaptation time ) com - pared with the shorter adaptation time led to more cumu - lative transfer of power and did not prevent lung damage , suggesting that the longer adaptation time strategy initiated injurious strain at an earlier time . In experimental and clinical studies , mechanical ven - tilation with high V T clearly promotes ventilator - induced lung injury . 13 , 17 , 31 In theory , excessive strain and ventilator - induced lung injury could be attenuated if V T were increased slowly enough to reduce lung heterogeneity progressively and to allow the extracellular matrix to adapt to high V T . This experimental study was designed to test that hypoth - esis by applying two potentially adaptive strategies in mild ARDS . In the ARDS model used herein , endotoxin was instilled intratracheally , 12 , 20 , 32 , 33 imposing a first hit with the intent of inducing or priming the lung for inflammation . ARDS animals allowed a longer adaptation time unex - pectedly experienced the converse , showing increased het - erogeneity index and interleukin - 6 gene expression when compared with those given a shorter adaptation time . The results of these experiments appear generally con - sistent with the unifying concepts of energy load , mechan - ical power , and repetitively excessive tidal stresses on the development of ventilator - induced lung injury . They also point to the potential for ventilator - induced lung injury to be attenuated or delayed ( despite greater exposure to cumulative power ) by a well sequenced , gradual approach to the maximum tidal stress and in so doing may offer insights into defining the root mechanical cause of venti - lator - induced lung injury . Although it is uncontested that tidal stresses and strains that exceed a rather sharp threshold hold potential to cause lung injury , 34 our results indicate that some degree of stress accommodation might occur if the application of high driving and plateau pressures were made gradually rather than abruptly . The exact mechanism of ventilator - induced lung injury at the cellular and extra - cellular matrix levels at different adaptation times remains to be precisely defined . 11 Both the absence of adaptation time and a longer run - up to high V T increased expression of interleukin - 6 and amphiregulin , which are early surrogates of inflammation 35 and alveolar stretch , 26 respectively . Amphiregulin expression is positively modulated by lung overdistension , and acti - vates chemokines , cytokines , and adhesion molecules . 12 , 26 , 34 In this study , amphiregulin expression was accompanied by ductal overdistension in animals with stepwise presenta - tion of high V T and , unexpectedly , by airway detachment in the Longer adaptation time group . Club cell secretory protein - 16 , a protein mainly produced and secreted by club cells in the respiratory or terminal bronchioles , has been proposed as a biomarker of lung epithelial injury , 36 and its expression was also increased in the longer adaptation time group . Interestingly , vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 , a marker of endothelial cell injury , did not vary among groups . Even though high V T resulted in endothelial cell damage in healthy lungs , 37 in the mild ARDS model used herein , the increase in V T led predominantly to greater epi - thelial cell injury . The damage caused using a longer adaptation time to reach high V T was not limited to epithelial cells ; it also affected extracellular matrix components . Repeated high stress and strain above a given threshold crossed before V T of more than 22 ml / kg may displace or rupture the extracel - lular matrix . 31 , 38 , 39 In the presence of an abrupt increase to high V T or of a protracted run - up time , metalloproteinase - 9 expression has been shown to increase statistically significantly . Metalloproteinase - 9 cleaves collagen and increases neutrophil influx , thus contributing to lung inflammation . 40 Expression of syndecan - 1 , a cell - surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan pri - marily elaborated by the lung epithelium and involved in reg - ulation of lung repair , remodeling , 27 and inflammation , 41 was higher only when V T increased abruptly . V T variations pre - dicted changes in syndecan - 1 expression , 13 highlighting the sensitivity of this biomarker to detect challenges to extracellu - lar matrix homeostasis .

Anesthesiology 2019 ; 130 : 767 – 77 773 Strain adaptation and Biotrauma inhibition and collagen synthesis , did not change to a statis - tically significant extent among groups . Our findings suggest that abrupt increases in V T may cause extracellular matrix fragmentation , 31 , 38 thus resulting in lung inflammation . To help explain the unanticipated disparity between adaptation strategies , we speculate that shorter adaptation time reduced heterogeneity index , overdistension , and matrix degradation without additional exposure to repeated injurious stresses and energy exposures that occurred in the more slowly ramped - up V T of the longer adaptation time group . The viscoelastic effects of stress redistribution , stress relaxation , and “creep” can be observed in the difference between pressure at zero flow and the steady - state pla - teau pressure when an end - inspiratory pause is sustained . 42 Although this process is quickly evident in injured lungs within the span of a single tidal cycle , complete accommo - dation requires longer to develop . 43 Our prior work showing that a slow approach to a high - pressure recruitment maneuver is associated with less injury 44 indicates a protracted time scale of adaptation in response to escalating PEEP . In the present study , however , PEEP was held constant , because the focus was on the accommodation to escalating V T . The integrative power exposure theory of ventilator - in - duced lung injury appears consistent with our findings 12 , 45 ; however , raw power can be applied in various ways . The Shorter adaptation time group encountered greater cumula - tive power exposure but developed less injury compared with the group with no adaptation , which suggests that the same level of mechanical power may be safely applied if delivered with tidal strains held below a certain level . Moreover , the span over which the rising energy load was building to reach its peak very likely allowed simultaneous stress relaxation to help disperse strain , improving tolerance . When comparing Fig . 3 .

CritiCal Care MediCine the shorter adaptation time ( less damage ) and longer adap - tation time ( greater damage ) groups , increased power expo - sure in the latter is a possible contributor but of itself seems unlikely to be the sole agent of injury . Despite marginal dif - ferences in cumulative power , there was a major difference in the degree of injury between these two adaptation groups . Recognizing that a sharp or indistinct tidal strain level must be crossed before injury develops , one possibility to explain these observations is that repetitive above - threshold strain - ing cycles were the main stimulus for injury and that the group with longer adaptation time sustained more of these over the time course of the experiments . It remains unclear whether it is the energy that is delivered above strain - injury threshold or repetitive excessive tidal strain cycling itself that progressively breaks down the extracellular matrix , damages epithelial cells , and degrades the structural microelements of the basement membrane in stepwise fashion . What is appar - ent after comparing shorter and longer adaptation time groups is that any initial accommodation to stress waned with duration of injurious stress . One attractive way to piece these observations into a coherent mechanism is to understand that injury and adap - tation proceeded along separate timelines : favorable influ - ences of stress relaxation and redistribution of air within the lungs were eventually overwhelmed by the accumulating number of damaging stress cycles in excess of the damag - ing threshold . An additional mechanism , alveolar – capillary barrier repair , may also have aided stress accommodation in the early phase of increasing V T . Repair of transient alveo - lar capillary permeability in rodents may occur in less than 5 min . 17 Moreover , lipid trafficking to and from the cellular plasma membrane , the incorporation of intracellular lipid vesicles in the existing plasma membrane , 46 and changes in cytoskeletal structure may also explain the differences between groups with shorter and longer adaptation times . 47 Limitations This study has noteworthy limitations . As a set of acute exper - iments conducted in a small - animal model of mild ARDS , these results clearly cannot be applied immediately to patient care . These findings apply to the specific experimental circum - stances and time intervals used herein . Furthermore , the dura - tion of experiments was not sufficient to determine whether injury was attenuated or simply delayed by the shorter adap - tation period . We cannot rule out that other variables or com - binations of variables might result in other outcomes . Future studies are required to confirm whether a hard threshold of transition to injury exists , to determine the level of any such threshold in this model of mild ARDS , and to evaluate strate - gies that slowly increase PEEP or respiratory rate . Nonetheless , apart from any mechanistic insights , these experimental data do have potential clinical relevance ; small V T values and restrained driving pressures are sometimes impossible to apply without initiating other aggressive measures to assure adequate pH and gas exchange . Our results should be considered evidence in support of a novel principle of lung protection—gradual appli - cation of a proposed increase in V T and stress with awareness of levels that approach the threshold of injury . Conclusions In experimental mild ARDS , lung damage in the shorter adaptation time compared with the no adaptation time group was attenuated by preemptive adaptation of the alve - olar epithelial cells and extracellular matrix . A longer adap - tation time compared with the shorter adaptation time was associated with increased cumulative power and did not prevent lung damage , perhaps because an injurious strain threshold was reached earlier , and such strain was imparted for longer ; this may have overcome the adaptation afforded by a briefer exposure to high - strain tidal cycles and out - weighed any benefit . The present data support the concept that ventilator - induced lung injury relates closely to repeti - tive cycling above a strain - injury level .

A year after co - discovering chloroform , Germany’s Justus Liebig synthesized its chemical cousin , the sedative chloral ( hydrate ) , in 1832 . Another German , apothecary Maximilian “Max” L . Frankenstein ( 1849 to 1898 ) , immigrated to Fort Wayne , Indiana , to practice as a pharmacist ( one of his Fort Wayne bottles , above ) . After then moving to Chicago to study at Rush Medical College , Frankenstein began sedating himself nightly , as a senior medical student , with chloral to combat insomnia . Discovered unconscious the morning of October 1 , 1898 , Frankenstein died less than 16 h later from his accidental chloral overdose . Could he have been saved , had he read Dracula ? That novel was published in London before Max died , but not in America until after his passing . Indeed , while writing Dracula , author Bram Stoker had created one character who cautioned chlo - ral users that they “should be careful not to let it grow into a habit . ” ( Copyright © the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ Wood Library - Museum of Anesthesiology . ) George S .
