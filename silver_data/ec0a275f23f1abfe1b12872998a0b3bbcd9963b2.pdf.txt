2301 Research Article Introduction The canonical transient receptor potential channels ( TRPCs ) are nonselective cation channels that are expressed in a variety of multicellular organisms with different functions ( Montell et al . , 2002 ) . The TRPC family can be divided by homology and function into four subfamilies : TRPC1 , TRPC2 , TRPC4 / 5 and TRPC3 / 6 / 7 ( Clapham , 2003 ) . They can form homomeric or heteromeric channels with distinct properties , such as current rectification and Ca 2 + permeability ( Clapham , 2003 ) . Some TRPC proteins are expressed in the CNS and function as important regulators during development ( Jia et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 1999 ) . TRPC1 is mainly localized to dendritic processes of dopaminergic neurons ( Martorana et al . , 2006 ) , whereas TRPC6 is localized to proximal dendrites and the axon hillock ( Giampa et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , TRPC5 is preferentially localized to the neuronal nuclei in the substantia nigra ( De March et al . , 2006 ) , and TRPC3 is mainly found in oligodendrocytes ( Fusco et al . , 2004 ) . TRPC1 participates in basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) - dependent neural stem cell proliferation ( Fiorio Pla et al . , 2005 ) . TRPC3 and TRPC6 are involved in brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) - mediated growth cone turning , neuron survival and spine formation ( Amaral and Pozzo - Miller , 2007 ; Jia et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2005 ) . TRPC5 inhibits neurite outgrowth in hippocampal cultures ( Greka et al . , 2003 ) . The establishment of dendritic morphology is critical for the development of neuronal circuits ( Cline , 2001 ) . Dendritic abnormalities are commonly associated with conditions resulting in mental retardation , such as Down syndrome ( Becker et al . , 1986 ) and Fragile X syndrome ( Dierssen and Ramakers , 2006 ) . A large amount of evidence demonstrates that Ca 2 + and its signaling control the development of dendrites ( Redmond and Ghosh , 2005 ; Redmond et al . , 2002 ; Wu and Cline , 1998 ) . Elevation in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration can lead to changes in dendritic morphology . The Ca 2 + influx through either voltage - sensitive Ca 2 + channels ( VSCCs ) or N - methyl - D - aspartate glutamate receptors ( NMDARs ) is important for activity - dependent dendritic growth ( Redmond et al . , 2002 ; Sin et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , transcription factors are involved in the Ca 2 + - mediated changes in dendrite morphology ( Aizawa et al . , 2004 ; Gaudilliere et al . , 2004 ; Redmond et al . , 2002 ) , among which , cAMP - response - element binding protein ( CREB ) is regulated by TRPC3 or TRPC6 ( Jia et al . , 2007 ) . Since TRPCs are Ca 2 + - permeable channels and their activation is less dependent on depolarization ( Venkatachalam and Montell , 2007 ) , we asked whether TRPC channels play a role in dendritic development . In the present study , we report that TRPC6 was highly expressed during the period of maximal dendritic growth and promoted dendritic growth through a CaMKIV - CREB - dependent pathway . TRPC6 transgenic mice showed upregulated phosphorylation of CaMKIV and CREB and more complicated dendrite structures . These findings revealed a novel role of TRPC6 during development of the CNS . Results Expression of TRPCs in rat hippocampus during development To explore the possible roles of TRPC channels during dendritic development , we first examined the expression of TRPC proteins in the developing rat hippocampus by western blot . TRPC1 and TRPC3 were detectable at postnatal day 14 and 7 , respectively ( Fig . 1A ) , and their expression levels remained high into adulthood . By The canonical transient receptor potential channels ( TRPCs ) are Ca 2 + - permeable nonselective cation channels with various physiological functions . Here , we report that TRPC6 , a member of the TRPC family , promotes hippocampal neuron dendritic growth . The peak expression of TRPC6 in rat hippocampus was between postnatal day 7 and 14 , a period known to be important for maximal dendritic growth . Overexpression of TRPC6 increased phosphorylation of Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent kinase IV ( CaMKIV ) and cAMP - response - element binding protein ( CREB ) and promoted dendritic growth in hippocampal cultures . Downregulation of TRPC6 by short hairpin RNA interference against TRPC6 suppressed phosphorylation of both CaMKIV and CREB and impaired dendritic growth . Expressing a dominant - negative form of CaMKIV or CREB blocked the TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth . Furthermore , inhibition of Ca 2 + influx suppressed the TRPC6 effect on dendritic growth . Finally , in TRPC6 transgenic mice , the phosphorylation of CaMKIV and CREB was enhanced and the dendritic growth was also increased . In conclusion , TRPC6 promoted dendritic growth via the CaMKIV - CREB pathway . Our results thus revealed a novel role of TRPC6 during the development of the central nervous system ( CNS ) .

During this period , the maximal dendritic growth is found in the cortex ( Miller and Peters , 1981 ) . Since TRPC5 inhibits neurite outgrowth ( Greka et al . , 2003 ) and TRPC4 , which belongs to the same subfamily of TRPC5 ( Vazquez et al . , 2004 ) , also inhibited the dendritic growth in our experiment ( supplementary material Fig . S1 ) , we further examined the spatial distribution of TRPC6 in rat hippocampus . In situ hybridization with a digoxigenin - labeled probe against the N - terminus of TRPC6 mRNA revealed that TRPC6 was highly expressed in all regions of P14 rat hippocampus ( Fig . 1B ) . Consistent with the mRNA result , the immunohistochemical study also showed that TRPC6 was expressed in all regions of hippocampus ( Fig . 1C ) . Our dual - labeling studies showed that TRPC6 immunoreactivity was colocalized with MAP2 staining in proximal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons ( Fig . 1D ) . These results suggested that TRPC6 might affect dendritic growth during the development of the brain . TRPC6 promotes dendritic growth We next studied whether TRPC6 affected dendritic growth . The hippocampal cultures were transfected with a TRPC6 construct together with GFP at 5 days in vitro ( DIV ) and the neuronal morphology was observed after 2 days . The protein level of exogenous TRPC6 was about 2 . 6 - fold higher than that of endogenous protein ( supplementary material Fig . S2 ) . As shown in Fig . 2A , B , the number of primary dendrites was similar in neurons transfected with TRPC6 ( 4 . 333±0 . 403 , n = 45 , P = 0 . 396 ) and those transfected with control vector ( 4 . 133±0 . 255 , n = 45 ) . However , the total number of dendritic tips was increased by 27 . 6 % in neurons transfected with TRPC6 ( 37 . 867±3 . 519 , n = 45 , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 2C ) compared with those transfected with control vector ( 29 . 667±2 . 534 , n = 45 ) . Similarly , as shown in Fig . 2D , the total dendritic length was increased by 45 . 1 % in neurons transfected with TRPC6 ( 1122 . 869±87 . 631 μ m , n = 45 , P < 0 . 0001 ) compared with that in neurons transfected with control vector ( 773 . 778±55 . 129 μ m , n = 45 ) . These results suggest that TRPC6 promoted dendritic growth . This notion was further tested in loss - of - function experiments . We made two short hairpin RNAi ( shRNAi ) sequences against rat TRPC6 : one was designed to target to both rat and human TRPC6 ( shTRPC6i - 1 ) and the other specifically to rat TRPC6 ( shTRPC6i - 2 ) . Both constructs suppressed the expression of rat TRPC6 in the primary hippocampal cultures ( Fig . 3A ) . In order to test the specificity of the RNAi constructs , we transfected HEK293 cells with these two constructs plus wild - type rat TRPC5 or wild - type human TRPC6 . The constructs did not affect TRPC5 expression , and as expected , shTRPC6i - 1 inhibited human TRPC6 expression , whereas shTRPC6i - 2 did not . The hippocampal neurons at 3 DIV were then transfected with a control RNAi vector targeting firefly luciferase , shTRPC6i - 1 or shTRPC6i - 2 , and neuronal morphology was examined 4 days after transfection . As shown in Fig . 3C , total dendritic tips in the neurons transfected with shTRPC6i - 1 ( 17 . 955±1 . 024 , n = 44 , P < 0 . 0001 ) or shTRPC6i - 2 ( 17 . 400±1 . 210 , n = 45 , P < 0 . 0001 ) were 37 . 4 % or 39 . 3 % less than those in the neurons transfected with control vector ( 28 . 679±1 . 556 , n = 45 ) . Moreover , neurons transfected with these RNAi constructs showed a 37 . 2 % or 38 . 1 % drop in the total dendritic length ( shTRPC6i - 1 , 500 . 471±20 . 895 μ m , n = 44 , P < 0 . 0001 ; shTRPC6i - 2 , 493 . 688±34 . 422 μ m , n = 45 , P < 0 . 0001 ) compared with those transfected with control vectors ( 798 . 218±25 . 445 μ m , n = 45 , Fig . 3D ) . We then performed the rescue experiment to make sure that the change in phenotype was not due to the nonspecific effect of RNAi . As shown in Fig . 3B , cotransfection with wild - type human TRPC6 and shTRPC6i - 2 eliminated the RNAi inhibitory effect on dendritic growth . However , introduction of human TRPC6 did not prevent shTRPC6i - 1 , which could also knock down human TRPC6 , from inhibiting dendritic growth . Together , these results suggested that TRPC6 promoted dendrite growth . Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 14 ) Fig . 1 . Expression pattern of TRPCs in hippocampal development .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 2303 TRPC6 promotes dendritic growth The effect of TRPC6 on dendritic growth is dependent on Ca 2 + influx It is known that Ca 2 + plays a critical role in regulating dendritic development ( Redmond and Ghosh , 2005 ; Redmond et al . , 2002 ; Wu and Cline , 1998 ) . We thus investigated whether Ca 2 + influx was necessary for TRPC6 - mediated dendritic growth . Treatment with 2 mM EGTA , known to chelate extracellular Ca 2 + and inhibit dendritic growth ( Redmond et al . , 2002 ) , caused a 28 . 5 % drop in total dendritic length and a 30 . 2 % drop in total dendritic tips compared with vehicle treatment ( Fig . 4A , B ) . Moreover , overexpression of TRPC6 in the presence of 2 mM EGTA failed to promote dendritic growth ( total dendritic length , 612 . 312±33 . 049 μ m , n = 45 , P = 0 . 073 ; total dendritic tips , 17 . 288±1 . 007 , n = 45 , P = 0 . 065 versus EGTA treatment ) , indicating that extracellular Ca 2 + was necessary for TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth . Then , we used Cd 2 + , known as a competitive inhibitor of Ca 2 + channels ( Swandulla and Armstrong , 1989 ) , to block Ca 2 + influx . As shown in Fig . 4A , B , treatment with 10 μ M Cd 2 + reduced total dendritic length by 39 . 2 % and total dendritic tips by 32 . 9 % . Moreover , the TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth was abolished by Cd 2 + ( total dendritic length , 451 . 952±26 . 746 μ m , n = 45 , P = 0 . 889 ; total dendritic tips , 13 . 669±1 . 001 , n = 45 , P = 0 . 693 versus Cd 2 + treatment ) . These results showed that Ca 2 + influx is critical for TRPC6 - mediated dendritic growth . We used OAG , an agent known to stimulate Ca 2 + influx through TRPC3 , TRPC6 and TRPC7 ( Hofmann et al . , 1999 ; Okada et al . , 1999 ; Venkatachalam et al . , 2001 ) , to examine whether Ca 2 + influx through TRPC6 was important for TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth . In response to OAG , the intracellular Ca 2 + level was elevated 1 . 5 - fold . This OAG - induced Ca 2 + elevation was attenuated by downregulation of TRPC6 ( Fig . 4C ) , indicating that TRPC6 was partially responsible for the OAG - induced Ca 2 + elevation . Consistently , OAG treatment also led to a 26 % increase in total dendritic tips and a 36 . 5 % increase in total dendritic length compared with results obtained with DMSO treatment . These OAG - induced increases in dendritic length and branching were abolished by downregulation of TRPC6 ( total dendritic tips , 18 . 272±0 . 707 , n = 45 , P = 0 . 4 ; total dendritic length , 689 . 048±27 . 473 μ m , n = 45 , P = 0 . 067 versus TRPC6 RNAi ) . Taken together , these results support the notion that the Ca 2 + influx through TRPC6 channels is necessary for TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth . TRPC6 promotes dendritic growth through CaMKIV The CaMKs play a critical role in dendritic development ( Fink et al . , 2003 ; Redmond et al . , 2002 ; Wayman et al . , 2006 ; Wu and Cline , 1998 ) . We therefore examined whether TRPC6 activates CaMKs to promote dendritic growth . Overexpression of TRPC6 increased phosphorylation of CaMKIV at Thr196 , a site known to be critical for its kinase activity ( Selbert et al . , 1995 ) , ( 1 . 592±0 . 323 , n = 3 , P = 0 . 042 , normalized to total CaMKIV ) ( Fig . 5A , B ) .

The two upper blots are total lysates of hippocampal cultures transfected with the shRNAi constructs targeting rat TRPC6 ( shRNA6i - 1 or shRNA6i - 2 ) and control shRNAi construct targeting firefly luciferase ( pPRIME - FF3 ) 96 hours after transfection using antibodies against TRPC6 and tubulin . The three lower blots show total lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with rat TRPC5 or human TRPC6 and shTRPC6i - 1 ( targeting both rat and human TRPC6 ) or shTRPC6i - 2 ( targeting only rat TRPC6 ) 48 hours after transfection detected using the indicated antibodies .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 2304 downregulating TRPC6 inhibited phosphorylation of CaMKIV at Thr196 normalized to total CaMKIV ( 0 . 693±0 . 153 , n = 4 , P = 0 . 029 ) . Changing the TRPC6 expression level did not affect the total CaMKIV protein level . Neither overexpression nor downregulation of TRPC6 affected CaMKII α at Thr286 ( supplementary material Fig . S3 ) , a site known to be important for its activation ( Colbran et al . , 1989 ) . These results indicated that activation of TRPC6 stimulated CaMKIV activity . Since activation of CaMKIV is required for dendritic growth ( Redmond et al . , 2002 ) , we asked whether TRPC6 affected dendritic growth through activation of CaMKIV . To address this question , we transfected hippocampal cultures with wild - type TRPC6 and CaMKIV - T200A ( DN - CaMKIV ) , which is a dominant - negative mutant of CaMKIV ( Lemrow et al . , 2004 ) . Expression of DN - CaMKIV reduced total dendritic tips by 28 . 89 % ( 16 . 733±1 . 322 , n = 45 , P < 0 . 0001 versus control ) and total dendritic length by 40 . 9 % ( 496 . 933±37 . 642 , n = 45 , P < 0 . 0001 versus control ) . As shown in Fig . 5D , DN - CaMKIV also abolished the TRPC6 - induced increases in dendritic branching and length ( total dendritic tips : 16 . 133±0 . 895 , n = 45 , P = 0 . 671 ; total dendritic length : 508 . 733±41 . 754 μ m , n = 45 , P = 0 . 813 versus DN - CaMKIV ) . However , transfection of the constitutive active form of CaMKIV ( CA - CaMKIV ) ( Yu and Malenka , 2003 ) rescued the change in phenotype induced by TRPC6 shRNAi . Transfection of TRPC6 shRNAi showed impaired dendritic arbors compared with control vectors ( Fig . 5E ) , whereas cotransfection of TRPC6 shRNAi and CA - CaMKIV ( total dendritic tips : 37 . 750±1 . 425 , n = 41 , P = 0 . 561 ; total dendritic length : 1089 . 833±36 . 979 μ m , n = 41 , P = 0 . 827 versus CA - CaMKIV ) showed no significant difference compared with transfection of CA - CaMKIV alone ( total dendritic tips : 39 . 091±1 . 749 , n = 45 ; total dendritic length : 1101 . 557±37 . 892 μ m , n = 45 ) . Thus , these data provide strong evidence that CaMKIV activity is required for TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth . Activation of CREB is essential for TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth Having established that activation of CaMKIV was required for TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth , we next investigated the downstream signals of CaMKIV . The best - characterized transcription factor target of CaMKIV in dendritic growth is CREB ( Matthews et al . , 1994 ; Sun et al . , 1994 ; Sun et al . , 1996 ) . It is also reported that TRPC6 induces phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 , a site required for CREB to associate with its coactivator CREB - binding protein ( CBP ) to promote dendritic growth ( Chawla et al . , 1998 ; Hu et al . , 1999 ; Jia et al . , 2007 ) . We therefore examined whether CREB was important for TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth . Downregulation of TRPC6 inhibited phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 normalized to total CREB ( 0 . 511±0 . 131 , n = 4 , P = 0 . 004 versus control ) ( Fig . 6A , B ) , suggesting that steady activation of TRPC6 regulated phosphorylation of CREB . In parallel with this result , overexpressing TRPC6 enhanced phosphorylation of CREB ( 1 . 809±0 . 378 , n = 4 , P = 0 . 048 versus control ) , further suggesting that CREB activity was indeed regulated by TRPC6 . The protein level of CREB was not changed in neurons overexpressing TRPC6 . We then asked whether TRPC6 affected dendritic growth through activation of CREB . As shown in Fig . 6C - E , TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth was completely blocked by KCREB , a dominant - negative mutant of CREB ( Walton et al . , 1992 ) . Neurons transfected with TRPC6 showed more complicated dendritic arborization than those transfected with control vector . However , cotransfection of TRPC6 and KCREB ( total dendritic tips : 13 . 474±0 . 889 , n = 45 , P = 0 . 086 versus KCREB ; total dendritic length : 570 . 669±34 . 562 μ m , n = 45 , P = 0 . 288 versus KCREB ) showed no significant difference compared with transfection of KCREB alone ( total dendritic tips : 12 . 330±0 . 616 , n = 45 ; total dendritic length : 496 . 072±26 . 318 μ m , n = 45 ) . Taken together , these results indicated the requirement for CREB activity in TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth . TRPC6 promotes dendritic growth in vivo Our culture results showed that TRPC6 promoted dendritic growth through a CaMKIV - CREB pathway . We then examined whether TRPC6 promoted dendritic growth in vivo . We overexpressed TRPC6 postnatally in the mouse forebrain neurons using the CaMKII α promoter ( Mayford et al . , 1995 ; Tsien et al . , 1996 ) . Western blot analysis revealed a 58 . 8 % increase of TRPC6 protein level in transgenic mice ( 1 . 588±0 . 297 , n = 5 , P = 0 . 028 ) ( Fig . 7A , B ) . Moreover , in the hippocampal lysates of TRPC6 transgenic mice , the phosphorylated forms of CaMKIV and CREB were increased Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 14 ) Fig . 5 .

To explore the changes in dendritic morphology , Golgi staining was performed at postnatal day 14 . Representative images of reconstructed CA1 pyramidal neurons from wild - type and transgenic mice were shown in Fig . 7C , D . Quantitative analysis revealed that there was a 28 . 9 % increase in total dendritic tips ( wild - type mice , 42 . 226±1 . 293 , n = 43 ; TRPC6 transgenic mice , 54 . 453±1 . 836 , n = 36 , P < 0 . 0001 versus wild - type mice ) and a 24 . 6 % increase in total dendritic length ( wild - type mice , 2899 . 617±84 . 171 μ m , n = 43 ; TRPC6 transgenic mice , 3612 . 216±92 . 813 μ m , n = 36 , P < 0 . 0001 versus wild - type mice ) . Both apical and basal dendrites in the transgenic mice were longer and more highly branched than those in the wild - type mice ( Fig . 7E , F ) . The dendritic tips of apical dendrites showed a 25 . 2 % increase and dendritic length a 29 . 3 % increase . Similarly , the dendritic tips of basal dendrites had a 28 . 2 % and dendritic length a 27 . 4 % enhancement . Taken together , these in vivo findings were consistent with the in vitro results , suggesting that TRPC6 induces CaMKIV and CREB activation to promote dendritic growth . Discussion TRPC channels participate in various physiological processes in the developing CNS ( Amaral and Pozzo - Miller , 2007 ; Fiorio Pla et al . , 2005 ; Greka et al . , 2003 ; Jia et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2005 ) . The present study revealed a novel role of TRPC6 in CNS development . Our results suggest that TRPC6 may act as a cellular sensor of environmental cues during dendritic development . Consistently , a recent study showed that hyperforin , a key constituent of St John’s Wort , could induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells by specifically activating TRPC6 ( Leuner et al . , 2007 ) . It is known that TRPC6 can be activated by either G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) or receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) through phospholipase C ( PLC ) - dependent mechanisms ( Hofmann et al . , 1999 ; Jia et al . , 2007 ; Venkatachalam and Montell , 2007 ) . As a result of PLC activation , phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is hydrolyzed to produce diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , which can directly activate TRPC6 , and inositol trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) , which can indirectly activate TRPC6 through the Ca 2 + release from internal Ca 2 + stores ( Venkatachalam and Montell , 2007 ) . These characteristics of activation make TRPC6 a candidate for an environmental sensor during dendritic development to translate Fig . 6 . TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth depends on CREB activity .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 2306 extracellular cues into intracellular signals . Since the establishment of the dendritic structure in the CNS is controlled by numerous extrinsic and intrinsic factors ( Riddle et al . , 1995 ; Rosso et al . , 2005 ; Whitford et al . , 2002 ) , exploring the role of TRPC6 in relaying these environmental factors into intracellular signal cascades will extend our understanding on dendritic growth . Previous studies have highlighted the important contribution of Ca 2 + influx , especially through NMDARs and VSCCs , to dendritic growth ( Redmond et al . , 2002 ; Sin et al . , 2002 ) . In agreement with this notion , we showed here that Ca 2 + influx through TRPC6 ( Fig . 4 ) is also critical for TRPC6 - induced dendritic growth . It is known that the activation of both NMDARs and VSCCs are depolarization dependent , whereas that of TRPC6 is less dependent on depolarization . This difference in activation mechanism implies that TRPC6 may have complementary functions in the regulation of dendritic growth . As shown in Fig . 1 , TRPC6 is already expressed in utero and in early postnatal days , a period when neuronal activity is relatively low . Given that the activation of TRPC6 is weakly associated with depolarization ( Vazquez et al . , 2004 ) , it is possible that TRPC6 promotes dendritic development when neurons are relatively quiescent , especially in the early postnatal days . Our results indicate that , in addition to NMDARs and VSCCs , TRPC6 acts as an additional channel to provide Ca 2 + in dendritic growth during the development . One interesting finding of the current study is that among the three TRPC channels including TRPC4 , TRPC5 and TRPC6 , which are expressed highly during the period of maximal dendritic growth , only TRPC6 promotes dendritic growth ( Fig . 2 , supplementary material Fig . S1 ) . The developing dendritic arbor is a dynamic structure , thus TRPC channels may participate in both promoting dendritic growth and pruning dendritic arborization , leading to the formation of proper neuronal circuits . Our present study cannot explain why only TRPC6 promotes dendritic growth . One possibility is that different TRPC channels may activate different signal cascades through different local signaling molecules . Alternatively , it is possible that the different Ca 2 + kinetics through these channels activate distinct Ca 2 + - sensing molecules , leading to different outcomes . Our results show that overexpression of TRPC6 enhances phosphorylation of CaMKIV , but not that of CaMKII α ( Fig . 5A ) . Activation of CaMKII α has been reported to inhibit dendritic growth and elevated CaMKII α activity can locally stabilize dendritic arbors ( Fink et al . , 2003 ; Wu and Cline , 1998 ) . It is possible that CaMKII α might be regulated by other TRPC channels . During development , dendrites dynamically change their growth phase , alternating between extension and retraction . It is possible that the dynamics of dendritic growth is regulated through different TRPC channels . In conclusion , we show that TRPC6 proteins are highly expressed in the period of maximal dendritic growth . TRPC6 promoted dendritic growth via the CaMKIV - CREB - dependent pathway . It is possible that TRPC6 plays a critical role in dendritic growth during early development , especially at the stages when neuronal activity is low .

The following primary antibodies were used : rabbit anti - EGFP ( Molecular Probes ) , mouse anti - MAP2 ( Chemicon ) , rabbit anti - TRPC6 ( Alomone Labs ) , rabbit anti - TRPC5 ( Sigma ) , rabbit anti - TRPC1 ( Alomone Labs ) , rabbit anti - TRPC3 ( from Craig Montell , Departments of Biological Chemistry and Neuroscience , Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD ) , rabbit anti - TRPC4 ( Alomone Labs ) , mouse anti - α - tubulin ( Sigma ) , rabbit anti - CaMKIV and mouseanti - CaMKII α ( Cell Signaling ) , rabbit anti - p - CaMKIV , rabbit anti - p - CaMKII α ( Santa Cruz ) . RNAi constructs The short hairpin RNA sequence together with a miRNA - 30 loop was inserted into pPRIME vector ( Stegmeier et al . , 2005 ) via Xho I and Eco RI sites . TRPC6 - shRNA sequences were designed to target rat TRPC6 mRNA ( NM _ 053559 . 1 ) corresponding to nucleotides 1485 - 1505 ( shRNA6i - 1 ) or 1158 - 1177 ( shRNA6i - 2 ) . The shRNA6i - 2 sequence also targeted against human TRPC6 mRNA ( NM _ 004621 . 4 ) corresponding to neucleotides 1915 - 1935 . The negative control was a hairpin sequence targeting the firefly luciferase inserted to the same plasmid by the same sites ( a gift from Stephen J . Elledge , Department of Genetics , Center for Genetics and Genomics , Harvard University Medical School , Boston , MD ) . Neuron cultures and transfection Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 ( E18 ) rat brains ( Shi et al . , 2004 ) . Cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly - D - lysine ( 50 μ g / ml ) at a density of 100 , 000 / cm 2 and cultured in Neurobasal A supplemented with B - 27 ( Gibco ) and 0 . 5 mM glutamine . At 3 or 5 DIV , neurons were transfected using the Ca 2 + phosphate method ( Ramos et al . , 2007 ) for 2 - 4 days . Briefly , DNA ( up to 5 μ g / well ) was mixed with 250 mM CaCl 2 and added to the same volume of HEPES ( 274 mM NaCl , 10 mM KCl , 1 . 4 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 15 mM D - glucose , 42 mM HEPES - free acid , pH 7 . 06 ) . The DNA mixture was incubated for 25 minutes in the dark and then added to the neurons in MEM without glutamine at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 for 15 minutes . For the RNAi verification experiments , transfection was done using the Nucleofector Device II and the Rat Neuron Nucleofector Kit ( Amaxa ) . Briefly , dissociated hippocampal neurons from E18 rat brain was mixed with 100 μ l Neuron Nucleofector Solution containing 2 μ g DNA . The mixture was transferred to the cuvette and program O - 003 was used . Cytosolic Ca 2 + measurements The intracellular Ca 2 + change was measured using the Ca 2 + - sensitive fluorescent dye Fura 2 - AM as described ( Jia et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , cells on 12 mm coverslips were incubated with 2 μ M Fura 2 - AM at 37°C for 20 minutes , washed 3 - 4 times with the extracellular solution ( 147 mM NaCl , 2 . 8 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES - free acid , pH 7 . 4 ) and imaged using a Nikon eclipse Te2000 - e microscope with dual excitations of Fura2 - AM at 340 nm and 380 nm and detection of fluorescent emissions at 500 nm . The 340 / 380 nm excitation ratio , which increases as a function of intracellular Ca 2 + , was captured at 6 second intervals . Immunoblotting Rabbit anti - TRPC1 antibody ( Alomone Labs , 1 : 200 ) , rabbit anti - TRPC3 antibody ( Montell , 1 : 500 ) , rabbit anti - TRPC4 antibody ( Alomone Labs , 1 : 500 ) , rabbit anti - TRPC5 antibody ( Sigma , 1 : 200 ) , rabbit anti - TRPC6 antibody ( AlomoneLabs , 1 : 500 ) , mouse anti - α - tubulin antibody ( Sigma , 1 : 1000 ) , rabbit anti - phosphoCaMKII α ( Thr286 ) antibody ( Santa Cruz , 1 ; 500 ) , mouse anti - CaMKII α antibody ( Cell Signaling , 1 ; 1000 ) , rabbit anti - phophoCaMKIV ( Thr 196 ) antibody ( Santa Cruz , 1 : 100 ) and rabbit anti - CaMKIV antibody ( Cell Signaling , 1 ; 500 ) were used as primary antibodies . HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit and goat anti - mouse antibodies ( Amersham , 1 : 5000 ) were used as secondary antibodies . For the signal detection , ECL Plus Detection System ( Amersham ) was used . Immunohistochemistry The brains of neonatal rats were embedded in OCT compound ( Tissue - Tek , Miles ) , and 30 μ m frozen sections were transferred to PBS . The sections were washed once with PBS and blocked with 3 % goat serum in PBST ( PBS plus 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ) for 1 hour . The sections were then incubated overnight with anti - TRPC6 antibody ( 1 : 100 , Alomone Labs ) and anti - MAP2 antibody ( 1 : 200 , Chemicon ) at 4°C . The sections were washed in PBST and incubated for 1 hour with Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibody ( Molecular Probes , 1 : 5000 ) and Texas - Red - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibody ( 1 : 5000 , Molecular Probes ) diluted in PBST . The fluorescent signals were examined using an LSM 5 PASCAl laser - scanning confocal microscope . In situ hybridization Nucleotides 1 - 1020 of rat TRPC6 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the T - easy vector . The vector was then digested with Bam HI or Eco RI to generate a template for the in vitro transcription of an antisense or sense cRNA probe , respectively . Digoxigenin - labeled cRNA was produced by T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase . In situ hybridization was then performed according to standard procedures ( Giger et al . , 1996 ) . Golgi staining Golgi staining was performed using Rapid GolgiStain Kit ( FD Neurotechnologies ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , the brain from postnatal day 14 mice was immersed in the impregnation solution for 2 weeks , then cut into 100 μ m sections using a vibratome . The sections were stained and dehydrated in graded Journal of Cell Science 121 ( 14 ) J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 2307 TRPC6 promotes dendritic growth ethanol , cleared in xylene and examined with the Neurolucida system ( MicroBrightField , Williston , VT ) with a 20 (cid:2) objective . Image analysis Confocal images of theneurons wereobtained using a LSM 5 PASCAl laser - scanning confocal microscope with sequential acquisition settings at the resolution of 1024 (cid:2) 1024 pixels . Each image was a z - series of 4 - 6 images at 2 μ m depth interval when 40 (cid:2) objective was used . The resultant stack was ‘flattened’into a single image using the maximal projection . Using the Neurolucida software ( MicroBrightField ) , the images were traced and reconstructed . The number of primary dendrites , total dendritic tips and total dendritic length was determined by the same software . Transfection experiments were carried out in duplicate wells and all experiments were repeated at least three times . More than 15 neurons per group were obtained each time . Data were mean ± s . e . m . The comparison of results between different sets of experiments was evaluated by Student’s t - test . We thank M . X . Zhu , T . Gudermann , D . Saffen , X . Yu , A .
