In this study , we demonstrate that CPPs comprised of nona - arginine ( R9 ) and a penetration accelerating peptide sequence ( Pas ) that facilitates escape from endocytic lysosomes , denoted as PR9 , greatly enhance the delivery of noncovalently associated quantum dots ( QDs ) into human A549 cells . Mechanistic studies , intracellular trafficking analysis and a functional gene assay reveal that endocytosis is the main route for intracellular delivery of PR9 / QD complexes . Endocytic trafficking of PR9 / QD complexes was monitored using both confocal and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . Zeta - potential and size analyses indicate the importance of electrostatic forces in the interaction of PR9 / QD complexes with plasma membranes . Circular dichroism ( CD ) spectroscopy reveals that the secondary structural elements of PR9 have similar conformations in aqueous buffer at pH 7 and 5 . This study of nontoxic PR9 provides a basis for the design of optimized cargo delivery that allows escape from endocytic vesicles .

Using this basic amino acid - rich sequence as a guide , many small peptides were designed that possess a similar membrane penetrating potential [ 2 ] . These peptides , dubbed cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) , may be amphipathic , hydrophobic or cationic [ 3 ] . CPPs can facilitate the delivery of cargoes , including DNAs , RNAs , proteins and nanoparticles , into living cells [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . More than 843 varieties of CPPs have been catalogued on a CPP site ( http : / / crdd . osdd . net / raghava / cppsite / ) [ 6 ] . Although CPPs have recently gained much attention as powerful tools to introduce exogenous molecules into cells , their cellular uptake pathways and subsequent intracellular trafficking are still not fully understood . Studies have suggested that CPPs utilize multiple pathways for cellular entry [ 7 – 9 ] . Endocytosis and direct membrane translocation appear to be two major uptake mechanisms for CPPs . Endocytosis is an energy - dependent pathway that includes two major categories : phagocytosis involv - ing uptake of large particles , and pinocytosis involving solute uptake [ 7 ] . Pinocytosis can be further subdivided into macro - pinocytosis , and clathrin - dependent , caveolin - dependent and clathrin / caveolin - independent pathways [ 10 ] . Endocytosis in - volves binding to membranes , accumulation in membrane - sunken vesicles , transfer to early and late endosomes , and fusion to become late endosomes / lysosomes [ 11 – 13 ] . The progress from binding to transport into early endosomes can be accomplished within 30 min [ 12 , 13 ] . Direct membrane translocation , also known as direct cell penetration , includes a variety of energy - independent pathways , such as pore formation , inverted micelle formation , carpet - like alternations and membrane thinning [ 7 , 9 ] . Various physical and pharmacological endocytic inhibitors can be used to identify pathways of CPP - mediated transduction . For instance , low temperature ( 4 u C ) treatment arrests all energy - dependent movement across the cell membrane [ 14 ] . The endocytic inhibitor cytochalasin D ( CytD ) , an F - actin polymeri - zation disrupter , perturbs endocytic processes that involve clathrin - , caveolae - dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis [ 15 , 16 ] . 5 - ( N - ethyl - N - isopropyl ) - amiloride ( EIPA ) specifically in - hibits macropinocytosis by inhibiting Na + / H + exchange proteins [ 16 , 17 ] . Filipin inhibits lipid raft dependent caveolae endocytosis , while nocodazole inhibits clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 15 , 16 ] . The destination of materials internalized by endocytosis is acidic lysosomes , where proteins and other molecules may be degraded by hydrolytic enzymes [ 18 ] . PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e67100 Since endocytosis is one of the primary membrane translocation mechanisms of CPPs , escape from endocytic vesicles is essential to preserve biological activity of endocytosed cargoes [ 7 – 9 , 11 ] . Chloroquine , a lysosomotropic agent , is commonly used to circumvent this problem [ 19 , 20 ] . Alternatively , peptides with certain sequences can be effective . For instance , the penetration accelerating sequence ( Pas ) is a synthetic peptide ( FFLIPKG ) derived from the cleavable sequence ( GKPILFF ) of cathepsin D enzyme , a lysosomal aspartyl protease [ 21 , 22 ] . Addition of Pas to octa - arginine ( R8 ) , denoted as PasR8 , enhances the efficiency of intracellular delivery of bioactive peptides by promoting endoso - mal escape [ 21 ] . Quantum dots ( QDs ) are colloidal , inorganic nanoparticles with unique chemical and physical properties [ 23 ] . They are excellent alternatives to fluorescent proteins due to their high photolumi - nescent quantum efficiency , photostability , tunability , narrow emission spectral band and prolonged fluorescence lifetime , and they have been extensively used in various cellular imaging applications [ 23 – 26 ] . Although QDs can be used to monitor cellular processes , they enter cells very slowly and become entrapped in endosomes [ 25 – 27 ] . To overcome these limitations , surface modified QDs by covalent [ 28 – 30 ] or noncovalent [ 16 , 31 – 37 ] linkages with CPPs ( referred to as CPP - QD or CPP / QD , respectively ) have been introduced . The aims of this study were to ( 1 ) demonstrate Pas nona - arginine ( PR9 ) - mediated cellular internalization of QDs , ( 2 ) elucidate the cellular uptake mechanism and subcellular localiza - tion of PR9 / QD complexes , ( 3 ) identify the molecular mecha - nisms of intracellular trafficking of PR9 / QD complexes and ( 4 ) identify the physical properties of PR9 and PR9 / QD complexes that affect uptake . To achieve these goals , we synthesized PR9 and examined transduction pathways and intracellular shuttling of PR9 / QD complexes using flow cytometry and live cell imaging . To identify the cellular uptake mechanisms of PR9 and PR9 / QD complexes , pharmacological and physical inhibitors were used to block specific uptake pathways . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) was used to monitor endocytic progress . Certain physical properties of PR9 and PR9 / QD complexes were characterized using zeta - potential analysis and circular dichroism ( CD ) spec - troscopy . The toxicity of PR9 and PR9 / QD complexes was assessed using the 1 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 3 , 5 - diphenylforma - zan ( MTT ) dye reduction assay . This study provides valuable mechanistic insights into how PR9s promote escape from endocytic vesicles and provides a basis for the design of optimized cargo delivery in cells . Materials and Methods Cell Culture Human lung carcinoma A549 cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA , USA ; CCL - 185 ) were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) 1640 medium ( Gibco , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) bovine serum ( Gibco ) [ 38 ] . Preparation of Plasmid DNA , Peptides and Nanoparticles The pEGFP - N1 plasmid contains the enhanced green fluores - cent protein ( EGFP ) coding sequence under the control of the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA , USA ) [ 39 , 40 ] . Three arginine - rich CPPs , nona - arginine ( SR9 ; RRRRRRRRR ) , histidine - rich nona - arginine ( HR9 ; CHHHHHRRRRRRRRRHHHHHC ) , and PR9 ( FFLIPKGRRRRRRRRR ) , were chemically synthesized [ 33 ] . CdSe / ZnS QDs ( denoted as QDs ) with a maximal emission peak wavelength at 525 nm ( carboxyl - functionalized eFluor 525NC ) were purchased from eBioscience ( San Diego , CA , USA ) . Carboxyl - functionalized InP / ZnS QDs ( denoted as QInP ) with a maximal emission peak wavelength at 525 nm were synthesized [ 41 ] . Protein Transduction and Mechanistic Assay To analyze the kinetics of protein transduction , A549 cells were seeded at a density of 1 6 10 5 per 35 - mm petri dish and then incubated overnight in 1 ml of complete growth medium [ 33 ] . Six m M CPPs was mixed with 100 nM QDs ( i . e . , at a molecular ratio of 60 ) at 37 u C for 2 h to form CPP / QD complexes . Cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) twice . The cells were then treated with PBS as a control , 100 nM QDs only , or CPP / QD complexes in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 % serum at 37 u C for a period of 0 – 6 h . Cells were washed with PBS five times to remove free CPP / QD complexes before analysis . To determine the cellular uptake mechanism of PR9 / QD complexes , cells were treated with PBS as a negative control , 100 nM QDs alone , or PR9 / QD complexes prepared at a molecular ratio of 60 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 % serum at 37 u C for 30 min in the absence or presence of various pharmacological and physical inhibitors [ 16 , 33 ] . Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 u C to arrest energy - dependent movement across the cell membrane [ 14 ] , then treated with 100 nM QDs or PR9 / QD complexes at 4 u C for 30 min . After this treatment , the cells were washed with PBS twice to remove free QDs or PR9 / QD complexes , followed by flow cytometric analysis . The influence of modulators on uptake processes was investigated by treating cells with 100 nM QDs or PR9 / QD complexes in the absence or presence of 100 m M EIPA , 10 m M CytD , 5 m g / ml filipin , 10 m M nocodazole at 37 u C for 30 min . Non - transduced QDs or PR9 / QD complexes were removed from cell surface by washing with PBS five times . To assess lysosomal escape , cells were treated with QDs or CPP / QD complexes as described above in the absence or presence of 25 m M chloroquine for 2 h . Free QDs or CPP / QD complexes were excluded by washing with PBS five times before uptake was determined by flow cytometry . Flow Cytometric Analysis Cells were seeded at a density of 1 6 10 5 per well in 24 - well plates and incubated overnight in 500 m l / well of complete culture medium . Cells in the control and experimental groups treated with QDs or CPP / QD complexes were harvested and counted using a Cytomics FC500 flow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , CA , USA ) [ 33 ] . To detect green fluorescent proteins ( GFP ) , excitation was set at 488 nm and emission at 515 – 545 nm with a FL1 filter . Data were analyzed using CXP software ( Beckman Coulter ) . Results are expressed as the percentage of the total cell population that displays fluorescence . Subcellular Colocalization Analysis Endocytic vesicles appear within 30 min , and transport of vesicles toward lysosomes is completed in approximately 2 h [ 12 , 13 ] . To examine subcellular localization of the delivered PR9 / QD complexes , cells were treated with 100 nM green fluorescent QDs alone or CPP / QD complexes in RPMI medium with 1 % serum at 37 u C for either 30 min or 2 h . Cells were washed with PBS five times to remove free CPP / QD complexes , followed by staining with organelle - specific fluorescent trackers [ 16 , 33 ] . Treatments with organelle trackers included 16 . 2 m M Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen ; in blue ) at 37 u C for 40 min , Texas Red - X phalloidin ( Invitrogen ; in red ) at 37 u C for 20 min , 50 nM Cellular Delivery of Nanoparticles by PR9 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e67100 LysoTracker DND - 99 ( Invitrogen ; in red ) at 37 u C for 30 min , 50 nM MitoTracker Deep Red FM ( Invitrogen ; in red ) at 37 u C for 30 min , and 1 m M ER - Tracker Red ( Invitrogen ; in red ) at 37 u C for 30 min to visualize subcellular colocalization with nuclei , actins , lysosomes , mitochondria and endoplasmic reticula ( ER ) , respectively . To investigate intracellular trafficking of PR9 / QD complexes , cells were treated with PR9 / QD complexes at 37 u C from 30 min to 5 h , and then stained with 1 , 000 6 diluted rabbit anti - human early endosome antigen 1 protein ( EEA1 ) antibody and goat Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody fragment ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) at 37 u C for 12 and 2 h , respectively , to visualize subcellular colocalization with early endosomes . Confocal and Fluorescent Microscopy Fluorescent and bright - field live cell images were recorded using a BD Pathway 435 bioimaging system ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) equipped with Olympus 20 6 and 60 6 oil objectives ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) [ 33 ] . This system includes both confocal and fluorescent microscopy sets . Excitation filters were set at 377 / 50 nm , 482 / 35 nm and 543 / 22 nm for blue ( BFP ) , GFP and red ( RFP ) fluorescent proteins , respectively . Emission filters were set at 435LP ( long - pass ) , 536 / 40 nm and 593 / 40 nm for BFP , GFP and RFP , respectively . Bright - field microscopy was used to assess cell morphology . Intensities of fluorescent images were quantified using BD Pathway software ( BD Biosciences ) . Intracellular Trafficking of Different PR9 / cargo Complexes A549 cells were seeded at a density of 1 6 10 4 per well in 96 - well plates . Cells were treated with PR9 / QInP complexes prepared at a molecular ratio of 30 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 % serum at 37 u C from 30 min to 5 h ( i . e . , all PR9 / QD complexes were prepared at a molecular ratio of 60 , while all PR9 / QInP complexes were formed at a molecular ratio of 30 ) . The solution was then removed , and the cells were washed three times with PBS . The cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and LysoTracker DND - 99 followed by observation using a BD Pathway 435 bioimaging system . To determine whether PR9 can deliver functional genes , cells were treated with either 3 m g the pEGFP - N1 plasmid DNA alone ( control ) or a pEGFP - N1 plasmid DNA mixed with PR9 ( 27 nmole ) at a nitrogen ( NH 3 + ) / phosphate ( PO 4 – ) ( N / P ) ratio of 3 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 % serum for 30 min to 24 h at 37 u C . The solution was then removed , and the cells were washed three times with PBS . The cells were supplemented with 100 m l full growth medium and incubated at 37 u C for 48 h . After two days , the cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and observed using a BD Pathway 435 bioimaging system . Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM ) Morphological examination of PR9 / QD - and PR9 / QD - trans - duced cells was performed using a Hitachi H - 7500 transmission electron microscope ( Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) . PR9 / QD complexes were dropped on Formvar / carbon coated copper grids with 300 mesh and dried at room temperature . Cells were treated with PR9 / QD complexes , washed five times with PBS to remove free CPP / QD complexes , and then pre - fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaralde - hyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 3 ) for 1 h . The cells were washed with 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer twice at a 15 - min interval . The cells were post - fixed with 1 % osmium for 1 h and washed with 5 % sucrose . The cells were stained with or without 2 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated in a graded ethanol - acetone series , embedded in Spurr’s resin ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA , USA ) [ 42 ] , and then sliced using a Ultracut - R ultramicrotome ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Finally , the cell sections were immobilized on single - well copper grids for TEM analysis . Zeta - potential and Particle Size Measurements QDs ( 100 nM ) , PR9 ( 6 m M ) or PR9 / QD complexes at a molecular ratio of 60 was dissolved in double deionized water at pH 7 or 5 , representing physiological or endosomal conditions , respectively [ 43 , 44 ] . Each solution was temperature - equilibrated at 25 u C for 2 min in a zeta cell . Sizes and zeta - potentials of complexes were measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS and analyzed using Zetasizer software 6 . 30 ( Malvern Instruments , Worcestershire , UK ) [ 34 , 45 ] . Circular Dichroism ( CD ) Spectroscopy Twenty m M PR9 was dissolved in doubly deionized water with pH 7 or 5 at room temperature . CD spectra of PR9 were analyzed in a cylindrical quartz cuvette with a 1 mm path - length using a Jasco J - 715 CD spectrometer ( Jasco , Easton , MD , USA ) at a scan speed of 50 nm / min [ 46 ] . The contents of secondary structures were calculated using CDPro software . Cytotoxicity Assay Cells were seeded at a density of 1 6 10 4 per well in 96 - well plates and incubated overnight in 200 m l / well of full growth medium . Cells were treated with PBS as a negative control , treated with 100 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) as a positive control or treated with 25 nM – 5 m M QInP in RPMI medium with 1 % serum at 37 u C for 24 h , washed with PBS , and cultured in full growth medium at 37 u C for 48 h . The cells were treated with various concentrations of PR9 , individual or combinations of 6 m M PR9 , 100 nM QDs , 25 m M chloroquine and 15 m M QInP , as indicated , in RPMI medium with 1 % serum at 37 u C for 24 h . The cells were washed with PBS and cultured in full growth medium at 37 u C for 24 h . Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay [ 16 , 47 ] . Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as mean 6 standard deviation ( SD ) . Mean values and SDs were calculated from at least three independent experiments of triplicates per treatment group . Comparisons between the control and treated groups were performed by the Student’s t - test using levels of statistical significance of P , 0 . 05 ( * ) and 0 . 01 ( * * ) , as indicated . Results PR9 Displays Cellular Internalization at a Relatively Longer Time To investigate the efficiency of PR9 mediated transport of QDs into cells , a time course experiment was conducted in human A549 cells . QDs were premixed with or without CPPs SR9 , HR9 or PR9 for 2 h , added to cells for up to 6 h , and then analyzed by flow cytometry . At 1 h , the extent of uptake displayed the following order : HR9 / QD . SR9 / QD . PR9 / QD ( Figure 1 ) , and uptake of all CPP / QD complexes was essentially complete by 4 h . The differences in uptake kinetics may reflect the involvement of different uptake mechanisms . Endocytosis is the Main Pathway for Intracellular Delivery of PR9 / QD Complexes Various pharmacological and physical inhibitors were used to shed light on the uptake mechanism of PR9 / QD complexes . A549 Cellular Delivery of Nanoparticles by PR9 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e67100 cells were treated with PBS ( negative control ) , QDs alone or PR9 / QD complexes in the absence or presence of endocytic inhibitors , followed by flow cytometric analysis . The fraction of cells containing PR9 / QD complexes ( positive cells ) was reduced to 47 . 5 % by incubation at 4 u C , to 66 . 2 % by CytD , to 60 . 7 % by filipin , and to 71 . 7 % by nocodazole . In contrast , EIPA treatment ( a macropinocytosis inhibitor ) did not decrease uptake ( Figure 2A ) . These results indicate that classical energy - dependent endocytosis is the major route for cellular internalization of PR9 / QD complexes . To further validate our findings , cells were treated with QDs or CPP / QD complexes with a lysosomotropic agent chloroquine . Chloroquine increased the cellular delivery of SR9 / QD and PR9 / QD complexes , but not HR9 / QD complexes ( Figure 2B ) . This further supports the notion that cellular internalization of PR9 / QD complexes involves endocytosis . Colocalization of PR9 / QD Complexes with Actin Filaments and Lysosomes To determine the subcellular localization of CPP / QD com - plexes , cells were treated with QDs or CPP / QD complexes and then stained with organelle - specific fluorescent markers , including Hoechst 33342 , Texas Red - X phalloidin , LysoTracker DND - 99 , MitoTracker Deep Red FM and ER - Tracker Red to visualize nuclei , actins , lysosomes , mitochondria and ER , respectively . Merged images revealed that some PR9 / QD complexes coloca - lized with actins ( Figure 3A ) and lysosomes ( Figure 3B ) at 30 min and 2 h . SR9 / QD complexes colocalized with actins at 2 h ( Figure 3A ) and with lysosomes ( Figure 3B ) at 30 min and 2 h . HR9 / QD complexes did not colocalize with any organelles examined ( Figure 3A – D ) . Furthermore , CPP / QD complexes were not associated with mitochondria ( Figure 3C ) , ER ( Figure 3D ) or nuclei ( Figure 3A – D ) at any time . These results indicate that cellular internalization of PR9 / QD complexes involves classical endocytosis , in agreement with the results presented in Figure 2 . Intracellular Trafficking of Different PR9 / cargo Complexes The data indicate that PR9 / QD complexes are endocytosed . We investigated intracellular trafficking and the fate of the complexes over a period of five hours using signal colocalization of fluorescent CPP / QD complexes with organelle - specific mark - ers . Cells were treated with PR9 / QD complexes for 30 min , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 h , followed by staining with anti - human EEA1 antibody , LysoTracker DND - 99 and Hoechst 33342 . CPP / QD complexes and early endosomes showed limited colocalization at 30 min , and colocalization gradually increased from 1 to 5 h ( Figure 4A ) . Figure 4B indicates that PR9 / QD complexes enter lysosomes ( see insets 1 , 2 , 3 obtained at 30 min ) , and most complexes are trapped in lysosomes at 2 – 3 h ( see insets 1 , 2 , 3 at 2 – 3 h ) . Partially overlapping images between PR9 / QD complexes and lysosomes were obtained following longer treatments ( insets 1 – 3 obtained at 4 and 5 h of Figure 4B ) , suggesting an escape of PR9 / QD Figure 1 . Time course analysis of CPP - mediated cellular internalization of QDs . CPPs , including SR9 , HR9 and PR9 , were premixed with QDs and then incubated with A549 cells for 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 h .

High green fluorescent intensity was noticed at the periphery of the nucleus following the longer incubation , indicating an accumulation of PR9 / QD complexes in this region ( GFP channel at 5 h of Figure 4B and 4 h of Figure 4C ) . Colocalization intensity of PR9 / QD complexes and lysosomes was maximal following a 2 h incubation , and then started to decrease ( Figure 4B and D ) , indicating lysosomal escape . Figure 4C and E show trafficking of PR9 / QD complexes toward nucleus . The complexes spread out near plasma membrane at an early stage and later condense near the nucleus . Localization of PR9 / QD complexes in the nucleus was observed from 3 to 5 h ( Figure 4B , C and E ) . Together , these data indicate that after being endocytosed , CPP / QD complexes move sequen - tially from endosome to lysosome to cytoplasm to nucleus . To study intracellular trafficking of different PR9 / cargo complexes , A549 cells were treated with PR9 / QInP complexes for 30 min to 5 h , followed by staining with LysoTracker DND - 99 and Hoechst 33342 . Trafficking routes of PR9 / QInP complexes were recorded at different times . Merged confocal images reveal a colocalization of PR9 / QInP complexes with lysosomes and nucleus ( Figure 5A ) . Most PR9 / QInP complexes were trapped in lysosomes at 2 h , but exited the lysosomes and translocated toward the nucleus at 2 – 5 h ( Figure 5A ) . To demonstrate delivery of PR9 / cargo complexes to the nucleus , a functional gene assay was carried out . Cells were treated with pDNA alone or PR9 / DNA complexes for 30 min , 1 – 5 and 24 h , followed by staining with Hoechst 33342 . After a 24 h incubation , no fluorescence was detected in the cells treated with pDNA only ( Figure 5B ) . In contrast , green fluorescence was apparent in cells treated with PR9 / DNA complexes at later times ( Figure 5B and C ) , indicating that plasmid DNA delivered by PR9s can be expressed . These results demonstrate that different cargoes delivered by PR9 follow a similar trafficking pattern in cells . The functional gene assay confirmed the colocalization of cargoes with the nucleus at a later stage . TEM The morphology of PR9 / QD complexes and PR9 / QD - transduced cells was observed using a Hitachi TEM . PR9 / QD complexes were spherical with an average diameter of 2 . 0 6 0 . 1 nm ( Figure 6A left ) . Electron - dense cores of PR9 / QD complexes were observed associated with the membranes of PR9 / QD - transduced cells following a 30 - min incubation ( Figure 6A middle ) . PR9 / QD complexes were observed in a lysosome after a 2 - h incubation ( Figure 6A right ) . The endocytic progress of PR9 / QD complexes was indicated by the appearance of labeled macropinosomes and lysosomes in PR9 / QD - transduced cells ( Figure 6B ) . PR9 / QD complexes on the membrane were observed enclosed in a clathrin - coated pit ( Figure 6C ) , and later enclosed within a vesicle ( early endosome ) ( Figure 6D ) . PR9 / QD complex - es - containing macropinosomes , which ultimately fuse with lyso - somes ( Figure 6E ) , were noted in lamellipodia - like membrane protrusions ( Figure 6F ) . These results indicate that PR9 transports QDs into cells by an endocytic pathway . Zeta - potential , Particle Size Measurements and CD Spectroscopy To characterize the physical properties of PR9 and PR9 / QD complexes , zeta - potential , particle size and secondary structure of PR9 were determined .

Zeta - potentials of QDs were electro - negative at pH 7 ( 2 25 . 1 6 2 . 2 mV ) and pH 5 ( 2 27 . 3 6 1 . 2 mV ) ( Figure 7A ) ; zeta - potentials of arginine - rich PR9 were 14 . 9 6 2 . 4 mV at pH 7 , and 15 . 6 6 3 . 4 mV at pH 5 . PR9 / QD complexes were even more positive : 21 . 7 6 1 . 1 mV at pH 7 and 17 . 4 6 4 . 2 mV at pH 5 , conditions favoring protein transduction . On the other hand , PR9 / QD complexes were of similar sizes : 16 . 9 6 1 . 4 and 17 . 1 6 2 . 6 nm at pH 7 and 5 , respectively , while PR9 / QD complexes were larger than QDs ( Figure 7B ) . These results agree with our recent report that the electrostatic interactions of CPP / cargo complexes can be a predictor of transduction efficiency within the charge range tested [ 48 ] , emphasizing the significance of zeta - potential for the transduction of PR9 / QD complexes .

PR9 conformations were very similar at pH 7 and 5 ( Figure 7C ) . Collectively , these results indicate that zeta - potentials of CPP / QD complexes are a key factor of transduction efficiency [ 48 ] , reflecting the importance of electrostatic interactions of PR9 / QD complexes with plasma membranes and endomembrane system . Cytotoxicity The MTT assay was used to determine the effect of PR9 - mediated cargo delivery on cell viability . Cells were treated with either individual or a combination of PR9s , QDs , chloroquine and QInP , as indicated . None of the materials used in this study caused cytotoxicity ( Figure 8 ) , indicating that arginine - rich PR9 would be a safe vehicle to carry cargo into cells . Discussion In this study , we demonstrate that classical energy - dependent endocytosis is the major route for cellular internalization of PR9 / QD complexes , and that chloroquine exerts a lysosomotropic effect on PR9 / QD complexes , allowing them to escape from endocytic vesicles into the cytoplasm . PR9 / QD complexes colocalize with actins , lysosomes , early endosomes and nucleus . TEM analysis revealed the endocytic trafficking of PR9 / QD complexes in cells . A reporter gene assay confirmed that plasmid DNA delivered by PR9s can be actively expressed by cells [ 49 ] . Zeta - potentials of CPP / cargo complexes correlated with trans - duction efficiency [ 48 ] , emphasizing the importance of electro - static interactions of PR9 / QD complexes with plasma mem - branes . Cell viability assay confirmed that none of the components of the PR9 / QD complexes are cytotoxic . CPP transduction of QDs into stem cells with high transduction efficiency and low cytotoxicity has been demonstrated [ 37 , 50 , 51 ] . Moreover , we have shown that PR9 and PR9 / cargo complexes are relatively nontoxic in A549 cells by SRB [ 33 ] and MTT [ 52 , 53 ] assays . Our present results with PR9 / QD complexes in human cells are consistent with these earlier results . It was reported that more than 80 % of adipose tissue - derived stem cells could be labeled by R8 / QD complexes prepared at a ratio of 10 , 000 within 1 h , and that the consequent fluorescent staining was maintained at least for 2 weeks [ 37 ] . No cytotoxicity was observed in cells transduced with less than 16 nM of QDs . In addition , the transduced cells could differentiate into adipogenic and osteogenic cells , indicating that the transduced cells maintained their stem cell potency [ 37 ] . Research on CPPs has focused on improving transduction efficiency . The hybrid PasR8 peptide markedly enhanced the translocation efficiency of active peptides by permitting endosomal escape in cells [ 21 ] . For instance , Pas conjugated with flock house virus ( FHV ) - derived arginine - rich peptide was attached to the p53 C - terminal 22 - amino - acid peptide ( p53C’ ) , a retro - inverso peptide that induces p53 - dependent autophagic cell death [ 54 ] . In another study , the growth of malignant glioma cells was inhibited by the triplex D - isomer peptides ( dPasFHV - p53C’ ) . Recently , the importance of hydrophobic sequences in the Pas segment , especially phenylalanine residues , in promoting cellular uptake of R8 was demonstrated [ 55 ] .

PasR8 working in a serum - containing medium was an additional advantage of the Pas segment , since serum - binding often decreases cytosolic internalization of CPPs . The promotion of cellular uptake by Pas addition is prominent when the molecular weight of cargoes is relatively small . Finally , the total hydrophobicity of PasR8 conjugates appears to be crucial for efficient cytosolic translocation [ 55 ] . TEM is a valuable tool for the morphological characterization of biological and nonbiological materials at high resolution [ 56 ] . Direct information on the intracellular distribution of transduced material comes from TEM , which reveals electron - dense cores of PR9 / QD complexes associated with plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm of PR9 / QD - transduced cells ( Figure 6 ) . While there are multiple types of endocytic pathways [ 15 ] , the endocytic progress of transport vesicles of the widely studied clathrin - dependent endocytosis of nanoparticles is from early endosomes to multive - sicular bodies / late endosomes and finally to lysosomes . TEM images of PR9 / QD - transduced cells obtained in the present study were generally in accord with this endocytic progression . PR9 / QD complexes were somewhat larger than QDs alone ( Figure 7B ) , suggesting that positively charged PR9s form stable complexes with carboxyl - functionalized QDs by electrostatic interactions [ 16 , 33 ] . Zeta - potential is a useful measure in nanoparticle applications that indicates the interaction energy on the particle - carrier surface [ 57 , 58 ] . Zeta - potential depends on nanoparticle size , methods of production and treatment , surface structure and the pH value of the environment [ 37 ] . The combined effects of both zeta - potential and particle size on nanoparticles provide insight into the stability of particles in solution [ 59 , 60 ] . We found that more electropositive zeta values of CPP / cargo complexes correlate well with protein transduction efficiency , presumably due to increased electrostatic interactions of PR9 / QD complexes with plasma membranes . In this study , the more electropositive PR9 / QD complexes had a higher transduction efficiency than PR9s or QDs . Qualitative secondary structure assignments of CD spectroscopy were based on the following : minima at both 208 and 222 nm , and maximum at 190 nm for a - helix ; minimum at 218 nm and maximum at 195 nm for b - sheet ; minimum at 198 nm and no positive peak for random coil [ 61 ] . We found that the secondary structural contents of PR9 have very similar conformations in aqueous buffers at pH 7 and pH 5 ( Figure 7C ) . These two patterns ( minimum at 198 – 222 nm and maximum ) of PR9 are similar to those of R9 , which is mostly unstructured in solution [ 62 ] . Binding of poly - L - arginine composed of 293 ( PLA239 ) and 554 ( PLA554 ) arginine - residues to an anionic phospholipid large unilamellar vesicle ( LUV ) was accompanied by a transition from random coil to a - helix structure ; however , a similar structural change was not observed with PLA69 and R8 [ 63 ] . Subcellular colocalization analyses revealed that HR9 / QD complexes do not colocalize with any organelles tested ; these complexes stay in the cytosol most of time ( Figure 3 ) . This result is consistent with our earlier demonstration that HR9 / QD com - plexes enter cells by direct membrane translocation [ 33 , 34 ] . In contrast , endocytosis appears to be the main route for intracellular delivery of PR9 / QD and SR9 / QD complexes [ 34 ] . However , SR9 / QD complexes entered cells by multiple pathways [ 64 ] . Among them , macropinocytosis , a lipid raft - dependent form of endocytosis , is a prominent route for SR9 / QD entry [ 65 ] . Actin forms microfilaments , one of key components of the cytoskeleton , participating in many cellular processes , including endocytosis . Macropinocytosis and classical endocytosis , such as clathrin - , caveolae - dependent , and clathrin - and caveolae - independent pathways , involve actin rearrangements . Therefore , the observed colocalization of PR9 / QD with actin , lysosomes and early endosomes , indicates that these complexes enter cells through an endocytic pathway . Numerous factors , including experimental conditions , physico - chemical properties of CPPs and their cargoes , cell type , temperature and serum level in the medium can influence the pathway of cellular uptake [ 7 , 11 , 66 – 70 ] . R9 , antennapedia peptide and Tat peptide use a combination of three endocytic pathways : macropinocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis and Figure 8 . Cytotoxicity of materials used for cargo delivery by PR9 as determined using the MTT assay . Cells were treated with QD , PR9 , chloroquine , PR9 / QD , QD / chloroquine , PR9 / QD / chloroquine , QInP alone and PR9 / QInP complexes for 24 h . Significant differences at P , 0 . 05 ( * ) and P , 0 . 01 ( * * ) are indicated . Data are presented as mean 6 SD from three independent experiments . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0067100 . g008 Cellular Delivery of Nanoparticles by PR9 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 10 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e67100 caveolae / lipid - raft - mediated endocytosis [ 66 ] . It seems likely that PR9s use the same three endocytic pathways ( Figure 2A and 3 – 6 ) . The chemical properties of the cargo molecules are a contributing factor of dodeca - arginine ( R12 ) peptide - mediated translocation [ 69 ] . R12 attached to hydrophobic cargoes stimulate dynamic morphological alternations in plasma membranes , and these structural changes allow R12 to permeate plasma membranes [ 69 ] . Conclusions PR9 / QD complexes comprised of a cell penetrating peptide ( nona - arginine ; R9 ) and a peptide penetration accelerating sequence ( Pas ) that promotes lysosomal escape noncovalently complexed with a quantum dot ( QD ) probe were evaluated as a cell transduction system . Histological results demonstrate that endocytosis is the main pathway for cellular uptake of PR9 / QD complexes . PR9 / QD complexes initially colocalize with actins , lysosomes and early endosomes , and later with the nucleus . Plasmid DNA delivered by PR9s was expressed by cells . Zeta - potential analysis revealed the importance of electrostatic interac - tions of PR9 / QD complexes with plasma membranes . PR9 / QD complexes were not toxic to the cells . Thus , PR9 may be an efficient and safe delivery vector for biomedical applications .
