Abbreviations used in this paper : NPF , nucleation - promoting factor ; V - ATPase , vacuolar ATPase ; WASH , WASP and SCAR homologue . Introduction Arp2 / 3 and nucleators The Arp2 / 3 complex is normally inactive , but when it binds to nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ; Pollard , 2007 ) , it becomes able to start new , growing actin filaments from the side of existing ones . Different NPFs initiate actin filaments in differ - ent locations . Most current research suggests that SCAR / WAVEs are principal drivers of lamellipodia and cell migration ( Steffen et al . , 2004 ) , whereas WASPs usually regulate endocytosis and the formation of structures such as podosomes ( Linder et al . , 1999 ) and invadopodia ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2005 ) . Recently , new families of NPFs have been discovered that generate actin at vesicular structures . WASP homologues associated with actin , membranes , and microtubules ( Campellone et al . , 2008 ) are im - portant for Golgi function but are only found in vertebrates . The WASP and SCAR homologue ( WASH ) , discovered as a gene in the subtelomeric region of human sex chromosomes , is essential for Drosophila melanogaster development through the larval stage ( Linardopoulou et al . , 2007 ) . WASH WASH , like SCAR / WAVEs ( Ibarra et al . , 2005 ) , is regulated as part of a protein complex ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . As with SCAR / WAVE and its regulatory complex , there are few clues about its function from protein sequences ; despite > 200 kD of protein , there are no known domains outside the Arp2 / 3 - and actin - binding WASH C terminus . The WASH complex is plainly important—all components are conserved , perhaps more widely than any other NPF ( Veltman and Insall , 2010 ) —but surprisingly little is understood about its precise function . It has roles in at least two different retrograde vesicle traffic pathways in mammalian cells : fast recycling from early endosomes ( Bear , 2009 ; Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Duleh and Welch , 2010 ) and retromer - mediated transport from recycling endosomes ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . W ASP and SCAR homologue ( WASH ) is a re - cently identified and evolutionarily conserved regulator of actin polymerization . In this paper , we show that WASH coats mature Dictyostelium dis­ coideum lysosomes and is essential for exocytosis of indigestible material . A related process , the expulsion of the lethal endosomal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans from mammalian macrophages , also uses WASH - coated vesicles , and cells expressing dominant negative WASH mutants inefficiently expel C . neoformans . D . discoideum WASH causes filamentous actin ( F - actin ) patches to form on lysosomes , leading to the removal of vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase ( V - ATPase ) and the neutralization of lyso - somes to form postlysosomes . Without WASH , no patches or coats are formed , neutral postlysosomes are not seen , and indigestible material such as dextran is not exocytosed . Similar results occur when actin polymerization is blocked with latrunculin . V - ATPases are known to bind avidly to F - actin . Our data imply a new mechanism , actin - mediated sorting , in which WASH and the Arp2 / 3 complex poly - merize actin on vesicles to drive the separation and re - cycling of proteins such as the V - ATPase .

T H E J O U R N A L O F C E L L B I O L O G Y JCB • VOLUME 193 • NUMBER 5 • 2011 832 the actin - binding proteins ABP120 ( Lee and Knecht , 2002 ) and coronin ( Drengk et al . , 2003 ) some time before indigestible mate - rial is exocytosed ( Rauchenberger et al . , 1997 ) . These vesicles are present in > 95 % of normal cells but completely lost from wshA  cells ( Fig . 1 c ) . Expression of a GFP - WASH fusion in wshA  cells fully res - cues the loss of these actin - coated vesicles ( Fig . 1 d ) . The GFP - WASH and actin coats localize to the same vesicles ( Fig . 1 d , green and red , respectively ) , suggesting that WASH directly in - duces the actin . We confirmed this using GFP - WASH in which the Arp2 / 3 - and the actin - binding VCA domains have been deleted ( Fig . 1 e , GFP - WASH  VCA ) . This localizes normally to the large vesicles but does not rescue the actin coats , implying that the actin coats are directly generated by WASH acting as an NPF for the Arp2 / 3 complex . Exocytosis is blocked in WASH mutants We measured the rate of fluid phase uptake in wshA  cells using fluorescent dextran ( Fig . 2 a ) . The initial rate of endocytosis was unaltered , although after incubations of > 1 h , the wshA – cells accumulated significantly more dextran than the parent ( Fig . 2 a , inset ) . Dextran is indigestible , and like the remains of food phagosomes ( Clarke et al . , 2002 ) , it is normally exocytosed  1 – 2 h after passing through the endocytic and lysosomal path - ways ( Maniak , 2001 ; Neuhaus et al . , 2002 ) , leading to a plateau in accumulation . Therefore , this implies a defect in exocytosis rather than during earlier traffic . Thus , we measured the rate at which fluorescent dextran was expelled after loading . As shown in Fig . 2 b , whereas wild - type cells expelled nearly everything within 2 h , wshA  cells were completely unable to exocytose dextran ( Fig . 2 b ) . Again , GFP - WASH rescued exocytosis near perfectly but had no effect when missing its VCA domain ( Fig . 2 c ) . Thus , WASH - stimulated actin polymerization is es - sential for exocytosis . This has serious consequences to cells that encounter indigestible material ( including , for example , bacterial cell walls ; Clarke et al . , 2002 ) , presumably explain - ing the growth defect on bacteria . When cells were grown in 20 % of 60 - kD dextran , which barely affects normal cells , wshA  cells became extremely distended with large fluid - filled vesi - cles ( Fig . 2 d ) and divided far more slowly ( Fig . 2 e ) . We loaded cells with BSA 15 - nm colloidal gold ( Neuhaus et al . , 2002 ) , washed them for 2 h , and examined them by trans - mission EM ( Fig . 2 f ) . Few wild - type cells contained BSA - containing vacuoles ; those few were usually single , contained few gold particles , and were often empty or filled with low - density material ( Fig . S1 c ) . However , 70 % of the wshA  cells contained BSA - gold ( Fig . 2 g ) , frequently at a high density and in densely stained vesicles . Single lysosomes often contained compacted deposits from several different endosomes , and fusion events were occasionally seen ( Fig . 2 g ) , suggesting that the wshA  lysosomes are a dynamic “trash bin” containing the indigestible remains of multiple endosomes . WASH in expulsion of Cryptococcus neoformans from macrophages Constitutive exocytosis of endocytosed material is rare in mammals . To test the generality of this pathway , therefore , It binds directly to the retromer complex , associating it with retrograde flow from endosomes to the trans - Golgi network . RNAi of WASH in mammalian cells causes a hard to interpret phenotype involving the dispersal of endosomes containing the mannose 6 – phosphate receptor and the tubulation of endosomal structures . The FAM21 complex subunit also associates with capping protein in mammals , suggesting a complex role in actin dynamics ( Hernandez - Valladares et al . , 2010 ) . Actin in Dictyostelium discoideum exocytosis In this paper , we discuss the role of WASH in generating F - actin coats in D . discoideum lysosome maturation . D . discoideum growing in axenic medium have a well - defined endocytic cycle using most of the components seen in mammalian cells but with a far more rapid transit time . One difference is in lysosome maturation . Wild - type D . discoideum grows by phagocytosing bacteria ; indigestible or inedible material is constitutively exo - cytosed between 90 and 120 min after endocytosis ( Clarke et al . , 2010 ) . This process involves a small proportion of total vesicu - lar traffic ; most liquid is extracted from vesicles early in the cycle , and most membrane is recycled between the endosomal and lysosomal stages . Constitutive exocytosis is rarely seen in mammalian cells , presumably because of a combination of the lower rate of flux through the endolysosomal system and a greater range of retrograde pathways . F - actin is polymerized on vesicles at two stages of the pathway . First , a fairly long - lived coat is seen between the lyso - somal and postlysosomal stages ( Drengk et al . , 2003 ) . A second phase of actin polymerization is seen immediately before neu - tralized vesicles are exocytosed ( Clarke et al . , 2010 ) . By comparison , this is short lived , involving multiple dynamic flashes of F - actin , and only occurs in the 2 – 4 min before expulsion . This process is thought to position postlysosomes for exocytosis . In this manuscript , we show that WASH is essential for the first phase of actin polymerization during lysosome maturation and that this actin is essential for the neutralization and recycling of the vacuolar ATPase ( V - ATPase ) . Results and discussion The D . discoideum WASH is well conserved , containing all the domains seen in human and D . melanogaster ( Fig . 1 a ) , and , like WASP and SCAR , is encoded by a single gene . We generated several disruptants of the gene ( wshA ) in an AX2 background , giving identical phenotypes . wshA  mutants grew at near - normal rates in liquid medium , though we observed slower growth on bacteria ( Fig . S1 a ) . They also showed no defects in cell migra - tion , moving , if anything , faster than parental cells ( Fig . S1 b ) . When wshA  cells were fixed and stained with phalloidin , there were also no visible changes in pseudopods or filopods at the leading edge . However , the large F - actin – coated intracellular vesicles seen in most normal cells were entirely absent from wshA  cells ( Fig . 1 b ) . These do not colocalize with WASP or SCAR and are distinct from early endocytic actin structures such as phagosomes and macropinosomes , which are seen at normal levels . They have been previously observed using GFP fused to 833 WASH , V - ATPase retrieval , and actin - mediated sorting • Carnell et al . in expulsion ( Fig . 2 i ) . Thus , WASH activity is important for C . neoformans expulsion in macrophages as well as D . discoi - deum postlysosomal exocytosis . WASH - and actin - driven lysosome neutralization When cells are loaded with a mixture of FITC - and TRITC - labeled dextran , neutral vesicles show yellow , but acidic vesicles are red because FITC loses fluorescence ( Jenne et al . , 1998 ) . Most intra - cellular vesicles are acidic , but they neutralize as they mature to postlysosomes ( Fig . 3 a , arrows ) . In wshA  cells , neutral post - lysosomes were never seen . Again , this phenotype was fully rescued by GFP - WASH but not GFP - WASH  VCA ( Fig . 3 d ) . This suggests that wshA  cells cannot exocytose dextran be - cause lysosomes are never able to neutralize and thus do not we examined macrophages containing the pathogenic yeast C . neoformans , which is expelled from endosomes by a similar process ( Alvarez and Casadevall , 2006 ; Ma et al . , 2006 ) that is potentiated by chloroquine , implying a role for vesicle neutral - ization ( Ma et al . , 2006 ) . Staining C . neoformans – laden J774 macrophages revealed a clear coat of WASH , similar to that seen in D . discoideum lysosomes , on the cytoplasmic face of the endosome , along with substantial accumulation of F - actin ( Fig . 2 h ) . We did not obtain satisfactory RNAi in macrophages . However , we have found that expression of WASH  VCA acts as a dominant negative in mammalian cells , for example by delaying recycling of transferrin ( Fig . S2 a ) , but did not affect overall cell morphology or motility ( not depicted ) . In macrophages , WASH  VCA expression did not affect uptake of C . neoformans but caused a substantive block Figure 1 .

Cells were transfected with full - length WASH or WASH  VCA , incubated with C . neoformans for 2 h , and then observed for 24 h . The difference is significant to P = 0 . 05 ( Fisher’s exact test ) . Error bars in each case show the SD . n = 3 in each case in a – c and e . 835 WASH , V - ATPase retrieval , and actin - mediated sorting • Carnell et al . loading , but this was still sufficient to block vesicle neutraliza - tion completely ( Fig . 3 b and Video 2 ) . The effect was rapidly reversible ; washing away latrunculin allowed neutralization to restart within a few minutes . Thus , actin polymerization is essential for vesicle neutralization . WASH and V - ATPase recycling The V - ATPase , which consists of a membrane channel ( V 0 ) and a cytoplasmic ATP - hydrolyzing proton pump ( V 1 ; Jefferies et al . , 2008 ) , mediates vesicle acidification . When it is removed , vesi - cles neutralize through proton leaks . It has been known for several years that subunits of V 1 have a surprisingly high affinity for actin . Each V 1 contains three B subunits , which have a sub - micromolar affinity for F - actin ( Holliday et al . , 2000 ) , and the single C subunit also binds actin ( Vitavska et al . , 2003 ) . Together , these imply an extremely high avidity for F - actin . We hypothe - sized that the WASH - derived F - actin coat on lysosomes was neu - tralizing them by binding and removing the V - ATPase . This was supported by coimmunoprecipitation from detergent lysates ( Fig . S3 ) . VatM and VatB subunits ( from V 0 and V 1 , respectively ) were identified with 100 % confidence from GFP - WASH pull - downs but not from GFP alone ( Fig . S3 ) . Thus , WASH can physically associate with V - ATPase either directly or as part of a larger protein assembly . However , our data suggest that this interaction results in V - ATPase recycling and is thus short lived . We simultaneously imaged VatB - RFP and GFP - WASH in cells that had been fed  2 - µm indigestible agarose beads , which made lysosomes large enough that they could be imaged continuously . As seen in Fig . 4 a and Video 3 , the V 1 subunit began dis - appearing from the lysosome as soon as puncta of GFP - WASH appeared . Quantitation shows V - ATPase levels start to drop within 1 or 2 min of the arrival of WASH ( Fig . 4 b ) . Unexpect - edly , however , WASH was only present in puncta , whereas the V - ATPase was removed ; all detectable V - ATPase had gone well before formation of the contiguous coat of WASH seen on postlysosomes . In yeast , V - ATPase is inactivated by dissociation of V 1 from the V 0 subunit ( Parra and Kane , 1998 ) , though it is un - clear how universal this mechanism is for metazoans . There - fore , we examined GFP - tagged VatM , a V 0 subunit ( Fig . 4 c ) , but both halves are recycled at a similar stage . The neutraliza - tion mediated by WASH , therefore , is not caused by a yeast - like mechanism in which V 1 is removed and V 0 is left on the vesicle . The implication is that the D . discoideum V - ATPase is recycled as an intact complex , but we have been unable to test this directly , as GFP - V 1 and RFP - V 0 appear to be impos - sible to coexpress . GFP - coronin , a marker for actin and the presence of the dynamic Arp2 / 3 complex ( Humphries et al . , 2002 ) , was recruited around the same time as WASH . GFP fused to vacuolin A , the D . discoideum flotillin homologue ( Wienke et al . , 2006 ) , accumulated earlier than WASH ( Fig . 4 b ) . This was surprising , as recruitment of vacuolin was thought to occur at the stage when lysosomes mature to postlysosomes ( Rauchenberger et al . , 1997 ; Jenne et al . , 1998 ) . Our data sug - gest that vacuolin is recruited more gradually , before the forma - tion of postlysosmes , and that WASH and WASH - induced actin are in fact the best available markers for the transition between mature to postlysosomes . It also suggests that the role of WASH and the actin coat it generates is to mediate lysosome neutral - ization and maturation . If this were true , lysosomal neutralization would be stopped by blocking actin polymerization . To test this hypothesis , we preloaded cells with FITC - dextran and counted the rate at which vesicles neutralized . As shown in Fig . 3 b and Video 1 , vesicle neutralization started  45 min after loading . We then used latrunculin A to block actin polymerization . To minimize sec - ondary effects , latrunculin was only added from 40 min after Figure 3 . WASH and actin polymerization are essential for vesicle neu - tralization . ( a ) Vesicle neutralization assay . Cells were loaded with FITC - and TRITC - dextran to distinguish between acidic and neutral vesicles . Neutral postlysosomes ( arrows ) are absent from WASH - null cells and are rescued by expression of GFP - WASH but not GFP - WASH  VCA ( GFP is not seen under these conditions ) . ( b ) Latrunculin A completely but reversibly blocks the neutralization of vesicles . AX2 cells were loaded with a pulse of FITC - dextran , and the appearance of neutral vesicles was monitored in the presence or absence of 10 µg / ml latrunculin A . The figure shows measure - ments of Videos 1 and 2 . The representative curves are from an experiment that was performed at least five times . JCB • VOLUME 193 • NUMBER 5 • 2011 836 Figure 4 .

Insets show a magnified view of the vesicle on which WASH is acting . ( b ) Quantification of various vesicular proteins during postlysosome formation . Graphs show that the loss of V - ATPase immediately follows the arrival of WASH and coronin , whereas the previously described ( Maniak , 2001 ) postlysosome marker vacuolin is present much earlier than neutralization and rises steadily . The representative curves are from an experiment that was performed at least five times .

Bar , 1 µm . 837 WASH , V - ATPase retrieval , and actin - mediated sorting • Carnell et al . The vesicle traffic and recycling pathways of metazoa are more complex than those of D . discoideum . However , it seems likely that the underlying physiological role is consistent . The functions of other NPFs are conserved across species . RNAi of WASH from mammalian cells causes a much less emphatic phenotype involving two or more recycling pathways at different stages of endocytic transport ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) , but each step involves retrograde path - ways , thus requiring neutralization . Although constitutive exo - cytosis of the D . discoideum kind is unusual in mammals , the example we have tested , the expulsion of C . neoformans , requires WASH , and expression of WASH -  VCA also al - tered the pattern of V - ATPase recruitment and recycling in C . neoformans – fed macrophages ( Fig . S2 b ) , again implying that these pathways are conserved . Actin - mediated sorting Overall , our data imply that the role of WASH and the Arp2 / 3 complex is to perform actin - mediated sorting , generating F - actin to sequester and remove specific proteins from vesicles . The V - ATPase has a particularly strong avidity for F - actin , but many other recycled proteins—in particular , growth factor receptors—have unexplained actin - binding activities that may in fact be tags for actin - mediated sorting . Furthermore , the un - usually clear , experimentally tractable phenotype we see in D . discoideum will enable genetic dissection of WASH function that would be impossible given the subtle phenotypes seen in mammalian cells . Materials and methods Cell culture and growth assessment D . discoideum cells were grown at RT in HL5 medium plus glucose ( Forme - dium ) either in Petri dishes or shaken in flasks . All subsequent experiments and imaging were also performed at RT . Measurement of generation time was performed in shaken culture with and without 20 % dextran ( wt / vol , molecular mass = 60 – 90 kD ) , with samples taken periodically and ana - lyzed for population density and cell size distribution using a cell counter ( CASY ; Roche ) . Cultures exceeding 2 × 10 6 cells / ml were diluted to 10 5 cells / ml . After 4 d of growth , differential interference contrast images of those cells that adhered to glass - bottomed dishes were taken using a micro - scope ( TE2000 - E ; Nikon ) with a 60× 1 . 4 NA objective fitted with a acidic lysosomes and neutral postlysosomes . To confirm this , we stained wshA  cells with antivacuolin ; the acidic lysosomes of the wshA  cells accumulated normal levels ( Fig . S1 f ) , confirm - ing that WASH is not involved in vacuolin recruitment . We imaged the beads at the highest possible spatial and temporal resolution ( Fig . 4 c and Video 4 ) . Lysosomes were rel - atively quiescent before the appearance of WASH . Soon after puncta of GFP - WASH were first visible , corrugations appeared on the edge of the lysosomes , and small vesicles containing puncta of both GFP - WASH and VatB - mRFP budded off . These vesicles are apparently the V - ATPase recycling vesicles pre - dicted by previous work ( Clarke et al . , 2002 ) and were recently directly observed ( Clarke et al . , 2010 ) . Our results show that these vesicles require WASH to function . Altogether , our data show that the role of WASH in D . discoideum is to cause new actin polymerization on mature lysosomes , and the role of this F - actin is to bind to the V - ATPase and sort it to recycling vesicles ( Fig . 5 ) . This allows the lyso - some to neutralize before being exocytosed . In the absence of WASH , the V - ATPase remains on the lysosome , which therefore remains acidic , immature , and unable to exocytose . The importance of actin to vesicle traffic is becoming increasingly clear ( Qualmann and Kessels , 2002 ) . Our work suggests that WASH , by sequestering vesicular proteins and connecting them to recycling vesicles , is a principal contributor . Our work raises several questions , in particular how the cells survive an apparently total block in their exocytic pathways . The block in exocytosis in wshA  mutants is near total , but only a very small proportion of either fluid or membrane is nor - mally exocytosed . Most fluid is removed along with nutrients early in the endocytic pathway . Nearly all of the membrane is also recovered ( Gotthardt et al . , 2002 ) , as shown in Fig . 4 . The accumulated lysosomes represent a very small fraction of the total throughput of the membrane . In cells not grown in indigest - ible material , the fraction is presumably even smaller . Thus , loss of WASH causes a relatively slight growth defect for cells grown in axenic medium . Indigestible material ( from bacteria or dex - tran in the medium ) ties up more of both and thus causes a seri - ous growth defect . Figure 5 .

For washout experiments , the dish was removed from the microscope , rinsed twice with fresh LoFlo medium , and immediately returned to the microscope . Images were acquired using Volocity software , and postlysosomes were quantified with ImageJ using its built - in Analyze Particles routine . Live cell imaging For imaging of cells expressing fluorescent fusion proteins , cells were placed in LoFlo medium at least 2 h before imaging . Cells were incu - bated for 20 min with agarose beads and then compressed under a layer of 1 % ( wt / vol ) agarose made using LoFlo medium . For quantitative microscopy , cells were imaged on an A1 confocal microscope ( GFP , 488 - nm excitation and 500 – 550 - nm emission ; mRFP , 561 . 4 - nm excita - tion and 570 – 620 - nm emission ) with a 60× 1 . 4 NA objective . For quali - tative high speed acquisition , cells were imaged on a TE2000 - U widefield microscope with a 100× 1 . 49 NA objective , with illumination provided by 473 - and 561 - nm solid - state lasers ( Deepstar ; Omicron Laserage Laserprodukte GmbH ) . Images were captured with a camera ( Cascade II ; Photometrics ) using Metamorph version 7 software ( Universal Imaging ) . ImageJ was used for the quantification of fluorescence around phago - cytosed particles using a doughnut - shaped region of interest to obtain mean intensity .

After phago - cytosis of Cryptococci , J774 macrophage cells were washed three times in DME without phenol red . Cells were imaged on a microscope ( TE2000 ) enclosed in a temperature - controlled and humidified environmental chamber ( okolab ) with 5 % CO 2 at 37°C . Time - lapse images were captured with a camera ( Digital Sight DS - Qi1MC ; Nikon ) with a 20× objective ( Ph1 PLAN APO 0 . 45 NA ) using NIS - Elements AR software . Fluorescence and phase - contrast images were captured every 2 min for 24 h . The occur - rence of expulsion was analyzed as described previously ( Ma et al . , 2006 ) . WASH and V - ATPase localization on C . neoformans – containing phagosomes J774 macrophages were fixed with formaldehyde 3 h after phagocytosis of C . neoformans and incubation at 5 % CO 2 and 37°C . After fixation , cells were labeled with anti - WASH antibody and TRITC phalloidin . RAW macrophages transiently expressing WASH or WASH  VCA were fixed with formaldehyde at the time points indicated after phagocytosis of C . neoformans and were labeled with anti - ATP6V1B2 . Images were cap - tured using a Digital Sight DS - Qi1MC camera with a 60× objective ( PLAN APO 1 . 4 NA ) using NIS - Elements AR software .

Gene disruption D . discoideum WASH - null cell lines were generated by targeted gene disrup - tion using homologous recombination . A plasmid was constructed contain - ing a floxed Blasticidin resistance cassette flanked with regions homologous to genes upstream ( dictyBase database accession no . DDB _ G0292876 ) and downstream ( dictyBase database accession no . DDB _ G0292972 ) of WASH ( dictyBase database accession no . DDB _ G0292878 ) . This con - struct was linearized and electroporated into AX2 cells . Blasticidin - resistant cells were screened by Western blotting using a peptide anti - WASH anti - body ( BioGenes GmbH ) for loss of WASH . Fluorescent fusion proteins Exogenously expressed proteins were cloned from cDNA by PCR . WASH and related genes were cloned into the extrachromosomal GFP fusion expression plasmid pDM351 ( Veltman et al . , 2009 ) . vatM and vatB ( without a stop codon ) were cloned into mRFPmars shuttle vectors pDM411 and pDM413 , respectively ( Veltman et al . , 2009 ) . These were then excised and inserted into a GFP - WASH extrachromosomal vector to create dual ex - pression constructs . Cell fixation Cells were seeded onto coverslips and allowed to adhere for 30 min . They were then fixed with 2 % ( wt / vol ) formaldehyde , 15 % ( vol / vol ) saturated picric acid , and 10 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 5 , for 15 min ( Hagedorn et al . , 2009 ) . Coverslips were washed in PBS before postfixation for 2 min with 70 % ethanol followed by sequential washes in PBS glycine . Cells were incubated with 33 nm Texas red phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) in PBS for 1 h . Coverslips were washed in PBS and mounted on glass slides using antifade reagent ( Prolong Gold ; Invitrogen ) . Cells were imaged using an inverted widefield micro - scope ( IX81 ; Olympus ) moved by a piezoelectric stage using a 100× 1 . 4 NA objective . Images were captured with a camera ( CoolSnap HQ2 ; Photometrics ) using Volocity software ( PerkinElmer ) . Iterative deconvolution was performed with a calculated point spread function using Volocity 3D image restoration software . Image contrast was adjusted using ImageJ soft - ware ( National Institutes of Health ) . Endocytosis / exocytosis assays Rates of endocytosis and exocytosis were assessed by measuring the intra - cellular level of FITC - dextran after its addition or removal from HL5 growth medium , respectively . For measuring rates of endocytosis , cells were sus - pended in 10 ml HL5 medium at 10 6 cells / ml and shaken at 120 rpm . Samples were taken to measure protein content before the start of the experiment to normalize results between replicas . 20 mg FITC - dextran was added to flasks , and 500 - µl samples were taken at 0 - , 15 - , 30 - , 45 - , 60 - , 90 - , 120 - , 180 - , 240 - , and 300 - min time points . To measure exocyto - sis , 10 - ml cultures at 5 × 10 6 cells / ml were incubated overnight with 20 mg FITC - dextran . Cells were pelleted and suspended in fresh HL5 me - dium , and samples were taken at the aforementioned time points . Samples were washed in ice - cold KK2 buffer and pelleted . Pellets were lysed in 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 9 . 3 , and 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 and measured on a fluorimeter ( 470 - nm excitation and 515 - nm emission ; Photon Technol - ogy International ) . Postlysosome visualization Visualization of D . discoideum postlysosomes was performed using FITC - and TRITC - conjugated dextran as previously described by Rivero and Maniak ( 2006 ) and Jenne et al . ( 1998 ) . Cells were seeded onto glass - bottomed dishes and incubated in LoFlo medium ( Formedium ) containing 4 mg / ml FITC - dextran and 40 mg / ml TRITC - dextran . After 1 h , dishes were imaged on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope ( FITC , 488 - nm excitation and 500 – 550 - nm emission ; TRITC , 561 . 4 - nm excitation and 570 – 620 - nm emission ) with a 60× 1 . 4 NA objective . Laser power and photomultiplier tube voltage were adjusted based on wild - type AX2 cells so that acidic lyso - somes and neutral postlysosomes could be visually distinguished . These settings were not changed between subsequent cell types or dishes . Images were acquired using NIS - Elements AR3 . 1 software ( Nikon ) . FITC - dextran pulse chase Wild - type AX2 cells were briefly incubated in LoFlo medium containing 4 mg / ml FITC for 20 min , after which the dish was rinsed twice with fresh LoFlo medium . After the pulse period , the dish was imaged by time - lapse microscopy on a widefield fluorescence microscope ( Olympus ) at low mag - nification ( 40× 0 . 75 NA objective ) using a camera ( QuantEM ; Photometrics ) . 839 WASH , V - ATPase retrieval , and actin - mediated sorting • Carnell et al .
