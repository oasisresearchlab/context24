Poster Abstracts • OFID 2017 : 4 ( Suppl 1 ) • S311 9 ) . Nasal specimens were used to detect clinical and colonizing pathogens using the Diatherix TEM - PCR Respiratory Panel . Results . A total of 90 recruits were enrolled in the study . Twelve recruits were lost due to training attrition in the first week of the study . The participants were male and the mean age was 23 yo ( SD 4 . 9 ) . There were 10 ( 13 % ) cases of ILI reported among the 78 remaining participants , 6 in week 1 , 3 in week 2 and 1 in week 9 . The most frequently detected pathogens in the 10 symptomatic cases were coronavirus ( 5 , 50 % ) , rhinovirus ( 4 , 40 % ) , other enterovirus ( 3 , 30 % ) , and influenza A ( 2 , 20 % ) . Pathogen co - detections were common , 8 out 10 cases were associated with 2 pathogens , repre - senting 7 unique combinations . While rhinovirus and coronavirus were most common among asymptomatic trainees , 10 % had detectable influenza A . Detection of multiple pathogens was common in the first two weeks of training ( 50 % among those who had viral detection ) . The study is still in progress . Conclusion . Symptomatic ILI was associated with coronavirus , rhinovirus , and enterovirus , in addition to influenza in the early weeks of training . Coronavirus and rhinovirus also circulated widely among healthy recruits , along with influenza . The findings will inform ILI control strategies for congregated military trainees . Disclosures . E .

Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and Safety of Intravenous ( IV ) Brincidofovir ( BCV ) in Healthy Adult Subjects Mary Beth Wire , PharmD ; Marion Morrison , MD ; Maggie Anderson , BS ; Thangam Arumugham , PhD ; John Dunn , PhD and Odin Naderer , PharmD ; Chimerix , Durham , North Carolina Session : 139 . Adult Viral Infection Friday , October 6 , 2017 : 12 : 30 PM Background . BCV is a lipid conjugate nucleotide that has shown rapid viral clear - ance in patients with adenovirus infection and improved survival in animal models of smallpox . In preclinical studies in rats , IV BCV dosed twice weekly for up to 29 days was not associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) , hematopoietic , hepatic , or renal toxicity . This study evaluated the safety and PK of IV BCV in healthy subjects . Methods . In this double - blind study , subjects were randomized 3 : 1 to receive IV BCV or placebo in sequential single ascending dose cohorts ( Table 1 ) . Plasma PK samples were collected over 7 days and assayed by HPLC - MS . Plasma BCV PK param - eters were determined by non - compartmental analysis and dose proportionality was assessed . Safety assessments were collected over 14 days . Results . Forty healthy male subjects ( 18 – 46 years , 83 % White ) were enrolled and completed the study . Plasma BCV Cmax and AUC∞ increased in proportion to dose ( Table 1 ) . AEs and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) elevations were dose - and infusion duration - related ( Table 1 ) . GI AEs were mild . All AEs and ALT elevations were tran - sient and no serious AEs occurred . Table 1 .

Adult Viral Infection Friday , October 6 , 2017 : 12 : 30 PM Background . In a Phase III randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of CMV - seropositive HCT recipients , letermovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of clinically significant CMV infections ( CS - CMVi ) through 24 weeks post - HCT . We investigated the impact of letermovir prophylaxis on mortality through Week 48 post - HCT . Methods . Adult CMV - seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA at screening who could initiate treatment by Week 4 post - HCT were eligible . Subjects stratified by high or low CMV disease risk were randomized 2 : 1 to leter - movir dosed at 480 mg / d ( 240 mg / d if on cyclosporine ) or placebo PO or IV through Week 14 post - HCT . Time to all - cause mortality and non - relapse mortality ( defined as death due to any reason other than the indication for HCT ) through Week 48 post - HCT are presented using Kaplan – Meier ( KM ) plots censored at study discontinuation for rea - sons other than death / non - relapse death or upon study completion . Distribution of time to mortality endpoints was tested by stratified log - rank tests using two - sided P - values . Results . This analysis included all 565 patients randomized and treated with ≥1 dose of study drug . Subjects began study drug a median of 9 days post - HCT ; 36 . 5 % started post - engraftment . The observed KM event rate for all - cause mortality was lower in the letermovir group ( 10 . 6 % ) than the placebo group ( 15 . 5 % ) at Week 24 post - HCT , and remained lower through Week 48 post - HCT ( 21 . 4 % vs . 26 . 2 % ) ( Figure 1 ) . The observed K – M event rate for all - cause mortality in subjects who devel - oped CS - CMVi was also lower in the letermovir group ( 4 . 6 % ) than the placebo group ( 17 . 1 % ) at Week 48 post - HCT . The observed KM event rate for non - relapse mortal - ity was lower in the letermovir group ( 6 . 9 % ) vs . the placebo group ( 11 . 2 % ) at Week 24 post - HCT , and remained lower in the letermovir group ( 13 . 9 % ) than the placebo group ( 17 . 5 % ) through Week 48 post - HCT ( Figure 2 ) . Conclusion . All - cause and non - relapse mortality were reduced in the letermo - vir group compared with the placebo group through Week 48 post - HCT ( relative risk reduction ~ 18 % and ~ 21 % , respectively ) . These results are consistent with a clinically meaningful survival benefit for letermovir prophylaxis . Disclosures . J .

Adult Viral Infection Friday , October 6 , 2017 : 12 : 30 PM Background . Human coronaviruses ( HCoV ) OC43 , 229E , NL63 and HKU1 commonly cause upper respiratory tract infections , but can also cause severe lower respiratory tract disease . Increased use of diagnostic assays for respiratory viruses has facilitated detection and , since 2014 , voluntary reporting of HCoV to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System ( NREVSS ) . Methods . We reviewed weekly aggregate test results for HCoV OC43 , 229E , NL63 and HKU1 voluntarily reported to NREVSS by U . S . hospital and clinical lab - oratories from July 1 , 2014‒April 30 , 2017 . Laboratories reporting any HCoV result using PCR were included , and the weekly percentage of positive HCoV tests by type was calculated . For a subset of HCoV detections reported to NREVSS via the Public Health laboratory Interoperability Project ( PHLIP ) , which collects individual - level demographic data , we described age distribution and sex . Age distribution by HCoV type was compared using the Kruskal – Wallis test . Results . 154 laboratories , across all 9 U . S . census divisions , reported 834 , 742 tests for HCoV ; 18 , 514 ( 2 . 2 % ) were positive for HCoV - OC43 , 8 , 363 ( 1 . 0 % ) for HCoV - NL63 , 6 , 828 ( 0 . 8 % ) for HCoV - 229E , and 5 , 170 ( 0 . 6 % ) for HCoV - HKU1 . The percentage of tests positive for HCoV generally peaked between December and March ( Figure 1 ) . HCoV - OC43 showed distinct annual peaks with variation in magnitude by year . HCoV - HKU1 and NL63 had similar patterns , each with notable peaks during winter 2016 compared with 2015 or 2017 . HCoV - 229E showed a discernable peak in 2017 compared with the previous 2 years . Of 20 , 533 individuals with HCoV test results reported via PHLIP , 1 , 589 ( 7 . 7 % ) tested positive for any HCoV ; 50 % of HCoV - positive individuals were male , and the median age was 22 ( range 0 – 96 ) years . Age distribution differed between HCoV types ( P < 0 . 01 , Figure 2 ) . Conclusion . Over approximately 3 seasons , peak positivity for HCoV occurred during winter months , and annual differences in circulation by HCoV type were observed . Continued testing and surveillance for HCoV will allow for further char - acterization of circulation trends over time and by geographic region , and improved understanding of the contribution of HCoV to the winter respiratory virus season .

PCR Array Profiling of Antiviral Genes in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells Expressing Human Coronavirus OC43 Structural and Accessory Proteins Meshal Beidas , MSc and Wassim Chehadeh , PhD ; Microbiology , Kuwait University , Kuwait , Kuwait Session : 139 . Adult Viral Infection Friday , October 6 , 2017 : 12 : 30 PM Background . Human coronavirus OC43 ( HCoV - OC43 ) causes common cold , and is associated with severe respiratory symptoms in infants , elderly and immu - nocompromised patients . HCoV - OC43 is a member of Betacoronavirus genus that includes also the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) coronaviruses . Both SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV were shown to express proteins with the potential to evade early innate immune responses . However , the ability of HCoV - OC43 to antagonise the intracellular antiviral defences has not yet been investigated . The objective of this study was to investigate the role of HCoV - OC43 structural ( membrane and nucleocapsid ) and accessory ( ns5a and ns2a ) proteins in the modulation of antiviral gene expression profile in human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK - 293 ) cells using PCR array analysis . Methods . HCoV - OC43 membrane ( M ) , nucleocapsid ( N ) , ns5a and ns2a mRNA were amplified and cloned into the pAcGFP1 - N expression vector ( Clontech ) , followed by transfection in HEK - 293 cells . Expression of M , N , ns5a and ns2a proteins were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence test . Three days post - transfection , the cells were challenged by Sendai virus . The Human Antiviral Response PCR array system ( Qiagen ) was used to profile the antiviral gene expression in HEK - 293 cells , using the fold regulation comparison and the manual normalisation methods . Results . Around 50 – 60 genes were downregulated by HCoV - OC43 proteins , the most prominent genes being those critical for the activation of transcription factors involved in the antiviral response like interferon regulatory factors ( IRFs ) and activator protein 1 ( AP - 1 ) . Among the most important downregulated genes were those coding for Interferons ( IFNs ) mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , pro - apoptotic and pyroptotic proteins ( Caspases , cathepsins , tumour necrosis factor ) , pro - inflammatory cytokines ( Interleukins ) , pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ; toll - like receptors and NOD - like receptors ) and their signaling transduction proteins ( TICAM1 , MAVS ) . Conclusion . This study shows for the first time that similarly to SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV , HCoV - OC43 has the ability to downregulate the transcription of genes critical for the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways .

Adult Viral Infection Friday , October 6 , 2017 : 12 : 30 PM Background . Human Coronaviruses ( CoV ) have been long recognized as a com - mon cause of respiratory tract disease including severe respiratory tract illness , yet there are few recent studies characterizing disease among adults in the United States . Here , we describe CoV infections and clinical characteristics among adults ( > 18 years ) presenting with respiratory illness in Cleveland , Ohio . Methods . Between February 1 , 2016 and April 30 , 2017 , 2949 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed by NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel in adults pre - senting with respiratory illness at MetroHealth Medical Center . Clinical data were collected on adults whose samples screened positive for CoV - HKU1 , CoV - OC43 , CoV - 229E or CoV - NL63 . Results . Coronaviruses were detected in 192 ( 6 . 5 % ) adults including 105 ( 3 . 5 % ) OC43 , 67 ( 2 . 3 % ) 229E , 13 ( 0 . 4 % ) HKU1 and 7 ( 0 . 2 % ) NL63 . The majority of adults with coronavirus infection were females ( 66 . 2 % ) with a median age of 53 years . Common comorbidities included smoking ( 40 . 0 % ) , asthma ( 38 . 0 % ) , COPD ( 35 . 4 % ) , and inhaled corticosteroid use ( 28 . 6 % ) . Eighty - five ( 46 . 4 % ) required admission to the hospital . Common presenting symptoms included shortness of breath ( 42 . 7 % ) and cough ( 31 . 0 % ) whereas fever was uncommon ( 12 . 5 % ) . Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in HKU1 and NL63 infected adults . Seventy - three percent of coronavirus disease occurred between the months of January and March . Despite the recognition of coronavirus infection , 70 ( 36 . 5 % ) received antibiotics for their disease . Conclusion . This study provides needed insight into clinical characteristics and severity associated with coronavirus infection in adults . Coronavirus infection should be considered in differential diagnosis of respiratory tract illness in adults including those that require hospitalization , have a history of smoking and have pulmonary comorbidities .
