Department of Medicine , Emory University , Atlanta , United States of America Siawpeng Er , MS Center of Operations Research in Medicine and Healthcare , NSF I / UCRC Center for Health Organization Transformation , Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta , United States of America Abstract — The rapidly increasing size of biomedical databases such as Medline requires the use of intelligent data mining methods for information extraction and summarization . Existing biomedical text - mining tools have limited capabilities for incorporating citation information during document ranking and for inferring topological and network relationships between biomedical terms . Often too much is returned during summarization leading to information overload . Furthermore , literature - based discoveries could be hard to interpret if the network is too complex . SEACOIN2 . 0 can incorporate citation information during document ranking and uses a unique association rule mining algorithm to generate multi - level k - ary trees . The multi - level trees facilitate efficient information retrieval , visual data exploration , summarization , and hypothesis generation . The system presents graphical summarization via multiple dynamic visualization panels and an interactive word cloud . LexRank algorithm is used to identify salient sentences in top abstracts related to the query . An average F - measure of 94 % was achieved for document retrieval , and an average precision of 88 % was obtained for identification of top co - occurrence terms . SEACOIN2 . 0 was also used to replicate previously published findings using the literature - based discovery and EMR - based PheWAS approaches . We present herein SEACOIN2 . 0 ( https : / / newton . isye . gatech . edu / SEACOIN2 / ) , an interactive visual mining tool for improved information retrieval , automated multi - level summarization of Medline abstracts , and literature - based discovery . SEACOIN2 . 0 addresses the problem of “information overload” and allows clinicians and biomedical researchers to meet their information needs . Corresponding author : Eva K Lee , eva . evalee . lee64 @ gmail . com Keywords—Information retrieval , visualization , data mining , knowledge discovery , hypothesis generation I . I NTRODUCTION Complex diseases such as cancer , diabetes , and cardiomyopathy involve multilevel interactions of cellular processes [ 1 ] . Knowledge and discovery of the multitude of interactions and relationships between genes , proteins , metabolites , mutations , epigenetic modifications and environmental factors are essential for understanding the pathophysiology of diseases [ 1 - 4 ] . Currently , over 26 million articles are available in PubMed ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pubmed ) . Studies have shown that it could take up to five years to keep up with the articles that are published per day [ 5 ] . To further scientific advances and to meet the information needs of the clinicians , intelligent tools and algorithms are required for rapid processing of the vast amount of information available in biomedical databases [ 6 ] . Biomedical text mining is a growing research area that involves information retrieval , information extraction , named entity recognition , knowledge discovery , and summarization from the scientific literature [ 7 , 8 ] . The concept of literature based discovery was established by Swanson based on his findings of the implicit relationship between fish oil and Raynaud’s disease [ 9 ] . Various text - mining tools have been developed since then for inferring gene - gene relationships , identifying semantic relations , gene - drug interactions , drug - disease relationships , gene - chemical - disease relationships , gene - disease interactions , protein - protein interactions , drug repurposing , and automated hypothesis generation [ 10 - 20 ] . However , the ability to summarize the large body of scientific literature and obtain a systems level overview of the interactions without running into the problem of “information overload” still remains a challenge . In a recent review , Lu et al . surveyed 28 text - mining tools for searching biomedical literature [ 21 ] . The authors categorized the existing systems based on features such as ranking search results , clustering search results into topics , extracting and displaying semantics and relations , and improving search interface and retrieval experience . Only 2 out of the 28 tools reviewed had graph - based visualization capabilities . Visual data mining facilitates exploration of large volumes of data by combining data mining methods with information visualization techniques . Previous studies have shown that the process of data exploration can be made more effective by including the human knowledge in the exploration process [ 22 ] . Although application of graph - based methods for summarization has been previously demonstrated , the complexity of graphs increases for large 1519 number of documents ( > 500 ) and the graphs become hard to interpret [ 23 , 24 ] . Our group has previously developed the SEACOIN system , S earch E xplore A nalyze CO nnect IN spire , as a proof - of - principle tool to address the problem of “information overload” by utilizing multi - level k - ary trees for summarization [ 25 ] . SEACOIN was designed to address various needs of biomedical researchers related to literature mining . The system allows users to control the depth of retrieved information , provides a familiar and simple - to - use interface , reduces the number of returned pages , and the result page format is conducive to users’ understanding of results . Its major summarization features include efficient information retrieval via navigational relationship networks and one - page summarization of abstracts related to a query . The system performance was compared with two other systems , Anne - O - Tate and Also Try ; and it was shown that SEACOIN provided most gradual and consistent filtering [ 26 , 27 ] . In this paper , we introduce SEACOIN2 . 0 , an improved system with a re - designed text mining framework and various new features as compared to the previous version such as : a ) ranking and selection of abstracts for downstream association mining based on relevance score , PubMed Central citation count or publication year ; b ) usage of a novel association rule mining algorithm based on pointwise mutual information , the term frequency - inverse document frequency , and domain knowledge ; c ) incorporation of a controlled vocabulary generated using PubTator , MeSH , and SNOMED - CT to restrict the terms in the k - ary relation trees to genes , proteins , biological processes , chemicals , species , mutations , microRNAs , histone modifications , diseases , and disorders ; d ) incorporation of multi - level “open” discovery association mining and summarization , an extension of the Swanson ' s ABC model for literature - based discovery ; e ) an improved text preprocessing workflow that incorporates stemming and stop words removal ; and f ) extractive summarization of the top 30 abstracts using the LexRank algorithm [ 28 - 33 ] . We evaluate the performance of the system using 1 , 112 abstracts from the BioCreative 2013 Track 3 learning corpus [ 34 ] . We also illustrate the utility of SEACOIN2 . 0 for literature - based discovery and literature - based Phenome - wide association studies ( Lit - PheWAS ) that could help identify novel associations between biomedical terms [ 9 , 35 ] . II . M ETHODS A . System Architecture SEACOIN2 . 0 is developed using PHP , Adobe FLEX , Java , Apache Lucene , RaVis Flex library ( https : / / code . google . com / p / birdeye / wiki / RaVis ) , and MySQL ( Fig 1 ) . Below we describe briefly the methods and implementation of some of the main components in SEACOIN 2 . 0 . B . Medline Data An indexed database of about 17 million abstracts from all articles in the Medline database published between 1975 and 2016 was initially created using Perl , Entrez e - utilities tools , and Apache Lucene . This database is updated automatically every month to reflect new published literature . Fig . 1 . SEACOIN2 . 0 System Architecture C . Controlled Vocabulary Dictionary and Stop Words A controlled vocabulary of roughly 3 . 2 million words was generated using biomedical / biological databases including MeSH , Snomed CT ( disorders , findings ) and the PubTator database ( a database that includes annotated list of genes , diseases , chemicals , mutations , and species in PubMed ) , and the databases in NCBI : Entrez Gene , Protein , PubChem compounds and substances , SNP , Epigenomics , and Taxonomy ( NCBI Resource Coordinators 2013 ) [ 30 - 32 ] . The WordNet database was used to filter words that did not overlap with any terms in PubTator and were not classified under the categories corresponding to biological processes , medical conditions / diseases , chemicals , body organs , and species : noun . state , noun . phenomenon , noun . artifact , noun . process , noun . animal , noun . body , noun . substance , and verb . body [ 36 , 37 ] . D . Text Preprocessing All abstracts were preprocessed in two stages : a ) tokenization ; and b ) filtering based on controlled vocabulary and stop words criteria [ 38 ] . A word probability distribution using the entire collection of PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2015 was generated . The top most commonly occurring words ( p > 0 . 005 ) along with the stop words used by PubMed ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / books / NBK3827 / table / pubmedh elp . T43 ) were removed from the abstracts . Additionally , words that were not included in the controlled vocabulary dictionary were also filtered from the abstracts . E . Document Indexing , Searching , and Ranking An information retrieval algorithm that uses the vector space model for retrieving relevant documents to the query was implemented To facilitate efficient document retrieval during various text - mining stages , the preprocessed PubMed abstracts were stored into an indexed database using the Apache Lucene package ( URL : http : / / lucene . apache . org / ) . Lucene is an open - source Java - based text search - engine library that includes highly 1520 efficient search and document scoring algorithms that allow querying based on phrases , wild cards and Boolean operators . Lucene scores the documents based on the term frequency - inverse document frequency ( TF - IDF ) scoring scheme as described in the software documentation available at : http : / / lucene . apache . org / core / 3 _ 6 _ 0 / api / core / org / apache / lucene / search / Similarity . html . The indexed documents are scored according to their relevance with respect to the query term . After relevance score assignment , the system allows users to rank and retrieve the top abstracts based on the relevance score , citation count in PubMed Central or year of publication for relation extraction . F . Statistical Association Analysis and k - ary Trees A k - ary tree is a rooted tree where each parent node has up to k child nodes . The maximum number of nodes , N , in a k - ary tree with h levels is given by (cid:1840) = ( (cid:1863) ( (cid:3035)(cid:2878)(cid:2869) ) (cid:3398) 1 ) / ( (cid:1863) (cid:3398) 1 ) ( 1 ) The system generates a 5 - ary tree for each query term with h = { 1 , 2 , 3 } levels . At each level , the information retrieval process within the system ( described above ) is performed in either open or closed discovery mode ( Fig 2 ) [ 19 ] . In the closed discovery mode , abstracts containing all ancestors ( e . g . : A and B at level 2 in Fig 2a ) in the query term ( AB ) are used to find the child nodes . In the open discovery mode , the abstracts containing the most immediate predecessor term ( e . g . : only term B at level 2 in Fig 2b ) in the query are returned . This allows discovery of both implicit and explicit relationships between biomedical entities and generate novel hypothesis as shown in Fig 3 for a 1 - ary tree scenario . Fig . 2 . Closed and open discovery modes . Illustration of the closed ( a ) and open ( b ) discovery modes for a 1 - ary relation tree with three levels An association rule mining algorithm based on pointwise mutual information ( PMI ) , TF - IDF , and domain knowledge is used to generate an ordered tree using the top co - occurring terms at each node ( query term ) as described below [ 28 , 29 ] . Fig . 3 . Multi - level summarization of abstracts related to “glutathione” in closed discovery mode . a ) level 1 : top 30 terms that co - occur with glutathione ; b ) level 2 : top salient terms in abstracts related to “glutathione AND reductase” , “glutathione AND cysteine” , “glutathione AND transferase” , “glutathione AND disulfide” , and “glutathione AND peroxidase” ; c ) level 3 : top salient terms in abstracts related to “glutathione” and salient terms from levels 1 and 2 ; d ) A sub - tree that shows the association of glutathione transferase mu1 ( gstm1 ) and glutathione transferase theta 1 ( gstt1 ) with different types of cancer . PMI between the query terms (cid:1872) (cid:2869) and (cid:1872) (cid:2870) is computed using equation ( 2 ) . If the probability of association of the two terms is greater than by chance , then a TF - IDF criterion is used to assign the association score shown in expression ( 3 ) . (cid:1842)(cid:1839)(cid:1835) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2869) , (cid:1872) (cid:2870) ) = (cid:1861) (cid:1499) (cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859) (cid:2870) (cid:4678)(cid:1868) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2869) (cid:1853)(cid:1866)(cid:1856) (cid:1872) (cid:2870) ) (cid:1868) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2869) ) (cid:1868) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2870) ) (cid:4679) ( 2 ) where i is a Boolean variable { 0 , 1 } such that i = 1 if term (cid:1872) (cid:2870) is present in the controlled vocabulary , 0 otherwise . p ( t 1 ) is the probability of term (cid:1872) (cid:2869) in the corpus , p ( t 2 ) is the probability of term (cid:1872) (cid:2870) in the corpus , and p ( t 1 and t 2 ) is the probability of co - occurrence of both terms (cid:1872) (cid:2869) and (cid:1872) (cid:2870) in the corpus . If PMI > 1 . 5 , then (cid:1871)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1870)(cid:1857) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2869) , (cid:1872) (cid:2870) ) = (cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859) (cid:2870) ( (cid:1872)(cid:1858) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2870) , (cid:1872) (cid:2869) ) ) (cid:1499) (cid:1835)(cid:1830)(cid:1832) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2870) ) ( 3 ) where tf ( t 2 , t 1 ) = frequency of term t 2 in documents related to term t 1 , D t1 , and (cid:1835)(cid:1830)(cid:1832) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2870) ) = 1 + (cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859) (cid:2870) (cid:4672) # (cid:3042)(cid:3033) (cid:3031)(cid:3042)(cid:3030)(cid:3048)(cid:3040)(cid:3032)(cid:3041)(cid:3047)(cid:3046) # (cid:3042)(cid:3033) (cid:3031)(cid:3042)(cid:3030)(cid:3048)(cid:3040)(cid:3032)(cid:3041)(cid:3047)(cid:3046) (cid:3050)(cid:3036)(cid:3047)(cid:3035) (cid:3047)(cid:3032)(cid:3045)(cid:3040) (cid:3047) (cid:3118) (cid:4673) else score ( t 1 , t 2 ) = 0 In the closed discovery mode , the same procedure is repeated at higher levels in the tree , but using equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , 1521 (cid:1842)(cid:1839)(cid:1835) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2869) , (cid:1872) (cid:2870) , … , (cid:1872) (cid:3040) ) = (cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859) (cid:2870) (cid:4678)(cid:1868) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2869) (cid:1853)(cid:1866)(cid:1856) (cid:1872) (cid:2870) (cid:1853)(cid:1866)(cid:1856) … (cid:1872) (cid:3040) ) (cid:1868) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2869) ) (cid:1868) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2870) ) … (cid:1868) ( (cid:1872) (cid:3040) ) (cid:4679) ( 4 ) (cid:1871)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1870)(cid:1857) ( (cid:1872) (cid:2869) , (cid:1872) (cid:2870) , … , (cid:1872) (cid:3040) ) = (cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859) (cid:2870) ( (cid:1872)(cid:1858) ( (cid:1872) (cid:3040) , … , (cid:1872) (cid:2870) , (cid:1872) (cid:2869) ) ) (cid:1499) (cid:1835)(cid:1830)(cid:1832) ( (cid:1872) (cid:3040) ) ( 5 ) where t m is the term at level h This multi - step approach conducts multiple dynamic searches and performs deep relation extraction . Furthermore , using PMI and TF - IDF criteria reduces the risk of incorporating random co - occurrences with commonly used words in the relation networks and allows prioritization of terms with respect to strength of association with the query [ 29 ] . G . Interactive Word / Topic Cloud An interactive word cloud is generated for the top 30 terms associated with query that are selected using the associating rule mining algorithm described above . The size of the terms in the word cloud is directly proportional to the strength of association [ 25 ] . Fig 3a shows a word cloud for “glutathione” as query term that includes different enzymes , amino acids , chemicals , biological processes , and other terms related to glutathione . Users can click on the terms to perform interactive filtering and update the list of retrieved Medline abstracts that contain both the query term and selected term , e . g . “glutathione and selenium” . H . Drill Down Summarization and Hypothesis Generation The k - ary trees allow systematic deep exploration and visual mining of the association pattern of co - occurring terms . The tree structure extends the original Swanson ' s ABC model to multiple levels , thereby making the hypothesis generation process more efficient while preventing information overload . The user interface includes a scroll bar that allows users to control the number of levels in the k - ary tree , h = { 1 , 2 , 3 } as illustrated in Fig 3 . This feature provides improved navigation of the relation trees as opposed to static graphs ; it also facilitates efficient visual mining of multi - level relations and hypothesis generation . Fig 3 shows the k - ary tree for “glutathione” at different levels . The association network includes genes , chemicals , enzymes , exposures , biological processes , and diseases / disorders . Fig 3a shows the top 30 terms found to be associated with glutathione at level one based on the association rule mining algorithm . Fig 3b shows level 2 associations using the updated search term that includes “glutathione” and the top 5 terms from level one , e . g . “glutathione AND transferase” , “glutathione AND reductase” , “glutathione AND peroxidase” . Fig 3c shows level 3 associations using “glutathione” and terms from levels 1 and 2 as search query . Fig 3d shows a sub - network for query “glutathione AND transferase AND cancer” . Exploring the relation network at deeper levels enhances the ability to discover “hidden” knowledge which is not feasible when using the single level association analysis . I . Query Based Extactive Summarization Summarization is the task of representing the information in the original text in fewer words [ 8 ] . The system first generates a meta - document using sentences from the top 30 ranked abstracts that include at least two words from the controlled vocabulary . The meta - document is then used as input for identifying relevant sentences using the LexRank algorithm . LexRank is a graph - based summarization method that uses cosine similarity and eigenvector centrality to determine the relevance of individual sentences [ 33 ] . The highest scoring sentence is assigned a score of 1 . The system uses the LexRank algorithm implemented in the PERL MEAD toolkit ( http : / / www . summarization . com / mead / ) . J . Web Interface All features are embedded within a web - based system ( https : / / newton . isye . gatech . edu / SEACOIN2 / ) . Fig 4 shows schematically the information and process flow within SEACOIN 2 . 0 . Specifically , the system takes as input a query term that triggers the search process to : (cid:120) Retrieve relevant abstracts according to the open or closed discovery mode criteria from the preprocessed indexed database , (cid:120) Process the relevant abstracts to generate a k - ary network , (cid:120) Generate a word cloud based on the top 30 co - occurring terms based on the query , (cid:120) Summarize the content of up to top 30 most relevant abstracts related to the query Fig . 4 . SEACOIN 2 . 0 . Information and Process Flow within SEACOIN 2 . 0 III . R ESULTS The annotated set of 1 , 112 abstracts from the BioCreative IV Track 3 CTD learning corpus was used to evaluate the performance of the system using standard text mining metrics such as precision , recall , and balanced F - measure [ 8 ] . The corpus includes curated annotations for each abstract such as chemical names , gene names , disease names , and action terms [ 34 ] . Each abstract in the corpus was preprocessed and indexed using the preprocessing and indexing workflow outlined in Materials and Methods . The following five highly represented biomedical terms corresponding to diseases / disorder , genes , and 1522 chemicals in the corpus were used for evaluating the document retrieval and relationship extraction : hypertension , schizophrenia , myocardial infarction , trpv1 , and cocaine ( Table 1 and 2 ) . A . Document Retrieval Evaluation Each abstract in the gold - standard corpus was annotated with genes , diseases , and chemicals . On average , a precision of 89 % , a recall of 100 % , and an F - measure of 94 % is achieved for document retrieval ( Table 1 ) . Table 1 .

Relationship Extraction Evaluation An average precision of 88 % is achieved for the top 10 co - occurring terms with the query term ( Table 2 ) , respectively . The list of terms found by SEACOIN 2 . 0 , but not present in the curated annotation list include names of enzymes ( hce1 ) , physical state ( hyperactivity ) and anatomical structures ( amygdala ) , demonstrating SEACOIN’s ability to detect biologically relevant information in an unsupervised fashion without manual intervention .

Hypothesis Generation Evaluation Using BioCorpus The search for “schizophrenia” in the evaluation corpus of 1 , 112 in the open discovery mode identified 11 abstracts related to schizophrenia and one of the subtrees includes schizophrenia ( level 0 ) - > bmy14802 ( level 1 ) - > dopa ( level 2 ) - > fosb ( level 3 ) as shown in Fig 5 . “fosb” was not mentioned in any of the abstracts matching “schizophrenia” or “BMY14802” , an anti - psychotic drug . Therefore , it can be hypothesized that the fosb gene and schizophrenia are possibly linked since our knowledgebase is restricted to the abstracts in the evaluation corpus . An independent PubMed search using “schizophrenia” and “fosb” resulted in 10 hits ( at the time of this writing ) . One of the articles supported the hypothesis that schizophrenia , fosb and BMY14802 are linked . In their recently published work , Dietz et al . showed that the fosb expression levels increased in schizophrenic patients who were prescribed antipsychotic drugs , while no effect in fosb levels was observed in patients who were medication free [ 39 ] . Fig . 5 . Illustration of literature - based discovery based on the evaluation corpus for “schizophrenia” . a ) A subtree / branch from the relation tree for “schizophrenia” generated by SEACOIN2 . 0 shows the relationship between schizophrenia , bmy14802 , dopa , and fosb ; b ) Conceptual representation of the implicit ( dotted lines ) and explicit ( bold lines ) relationships in a ) . The numbers on the edges correspond to the number of abstracts containing the connected terms ( nodes ) . D . Replication of Swanson’s discovery In 1986 , Swanson discovered an implicit relationship between fish oil and Raynaud’s disease based on the common link between the two , blood viscosity [ 9 ] . We restricted the Medline search to only articles published before 1986 and conducted a search for “fish oil” in the open discovery mode . One of the sub - trees in the network linked “fish oil” < - > “maxepa” < - > “viscosity” < - > “raynauds” ( Fig 6 ) . 1523 Fig . 6 . Literature - based discovery evaluation using “fish oil” as input query . Open discovery summarization graph for “fish oil” as parent query using Medline abstracts from articles published before 1986 . SEACOIN2 . 0 replicated Swanson’s fish oil < - > viscosity < - > Raynaud’s disease discovery E . Replication of EMR based PheWAS Results Recently , Denny et al . [ 35 ] published an electronic medical record ( EMR ) based PheWAS analysis where they studied associations between 1 , 358 phenotypes and 3 , 144 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in a population of 13 , 835 individuals . [ 35 ] The authors proposed several novel associations and reproduced previously known associations , e . g . “rs12203592” ( Acitinic keratosis , nonmelanoma skin cancer , brain damage , etc . ) and “rs2853676” ( seborrheic keratosis , glioma ) , ( Table 2 and Fig 3 in Denny 2013 [ 35 ] ) . We used SEACOIN2 . 0 to generate open discovery summarization graphs for rs12203592 and rs2853676 . The results are shown in Fig 7 . The associations that overlapped with the findings of Denny et al . are marked with green squares . Fig . 7 . Literature - based Phenotype - wide association analysis ( Lit - PheWAS ) . Open discovery summarization graphs for “rs12203592” and “rs2853676” using SEACOIN2 . 0 . a ) Top 30 terms associated with “rs12203592” ; b ) Multi - level 5 - ary tree for “rs12203592” showing its relationship with genes , SNPs , diseases / disorders ; c ) A sub - tree for “rs12203592” suggesting its association with skin cancer , eye , and brain . Related associations were seen by Denny et al . ; d ) A sub - tree for “rs2853676” suggesting its association with dyskeratosis , which overlaps with the association seen by Denny et al . with seborrheic keratosis . F . User Evaluation The results for the glutathione association network ( Fig 3 ) were independently reviewed by a leading expert in the field of redox biology ( Dr . Dean P Jones in Acknowledgements ) . The coverage of the top associated terms in the word cloud and the multi - level k - ary network were deemed to be satisfactory . IV . DI SCUSSION Many tools have been developed that aim to extract important information from biomedical literature . We have previously developed Search Explore Analyze COnnect INspire , SEACOIN , for easy and simple to understand summarization and visualization of medical literature [ 25 ] . SEACOIN 2 . 0 is an improved version that uses citation information in addition to relevance - to - query as criteria for retrieving documents and includes a novel association - mining framework based on point - wise mutual information and TF - IDF criteria for defining query - term associations and selecting top k terms for each parent query . The system facilitates “drill - down” hypothesis generation and summarization in both open discovery and closed discovery modes . This allows users to discover and explore both implicit and explicit relationships between genes , chemicals , proteins , diseases , and mutations as shown in Figs 3 , 5 , 6 and 7 . A controlled vocabulary is used to restrict the k - ary trees to biologically relevant terms . The new system also includes extractive summarization of the top abstracts . The system provides one - page summarization of the abstracts related to the query . A multi - level interactive topological visualization is used to present the k - ary relation network where each node represents biomedical / clinical terms associated with the query as shown in Fig 3 . Users can easily traverse the hierarchy of the network by changing the degree of separation . The system allows users to increase / decrease the depth of information retrieved as users can perform real - time filtering of the network and the corresponding documents by clicking on nodes of interest in the network . The word cloud is a visual representation of the words that are strongly associated with the query term . The terms included in the word cloud are representative of the search term . Users can click on any term in the cloud to update the network and the list of returned documents according to the k - ary string structure . This allows users to dynamically expand their queries and incorporate terms and topics related to the query for enhanced information retrieval . It also provides an alternative and an efficient search strategy to retrieve information as compared to those used by search engines like Google and PubMed . This flexible structure allows retrieval of large amount of complex information in a simple easy - to - understand manner . A table including the list of articles matching the search term is also presented . Users can choose to retrieve more information about each abstract from this table such as publication year , 1524 PubMed Central citation count , and relevance score . The evaluation of document retrieval and co - occurrence network extraction results from SEACOIN2 . 0 using the BioCreative IV corpus shows that the system can accurately retrieve most relevant documents related to the query without generating too many false positives . The results also show that the system can discover biologically meaningful query - term associations in both open and closed discovery modes . Fig 3 shows the network relationship of glutathione with genes , chemicals , enzymes , exposures , biological processes , and diseases / disorders generated using SEACOIN 2 . 0 in the closed discovery mode . Glutathione is a tripeptide ( cysteine , glutamate , glycine ) and is involved in various biological processes such as redox mechanism , immune response , and drug metabolism [ 40 - 43 ] . The sub - tree for query “glutathione AND transferase AND cancer” in Fig 3d shows the association of two glutathione transferase genes , gstt1 and gstm1 , with breast , colon , and bladder . Each sub - network represents a different theme providing a systems level coverage of the complex relationships between biomedical entities as compared to commonly used single level search strategies . As demonstrated in Figs 5 , 6 and 7 , SEACOIN2 . 0 allows users to discover previously unknown associations between diseases , genes , chemicals , etc . The system was able to replicate Swanson’s fish oil and Raynaud’s disease discovery when used on abstracts published before 1986 ( Fig 6 ) . We also demonstrate the ability of the system to facilitate literature - based PheWAS ( Fig 7 ) . Fig 7 shows a subset of associations that were found by SEACOIN2 . 0 for “rs12203592” ( a genetic variant of IRF4 gene ) and “rs2853676” ( a genetic variant of TERT gene ) . Some of the terms identified by our system overlapped with known and novel associations seen by Denny et al . in their EMR - based PheWAS study [ 35 ] . The results illustrate that SEACOIN2 . 0 could be useful for understanding the functional role or association patterns of genetic variants . The sub - trees in the multi - level relation network can help biologists generate novel hypothesis about how each SNP is associated with different diseases / disorders and other biomedical entities , which can be experimentally validated . For the two SNPs tested here , “mc1r” and “herc” genes were identified as intermediate common links between the query terms and various biomedical terms such as genes , diseases , disorders , organs , and biological processes . In a recently published article , the authors conclude that both IRF4 and MC1R genes are likely to be related to pigmentation and cancer [ 44 ] . These results show that the visual mining and “drill - down” hypothesis generation and summarization framework in SEACOIN2 . 0 allows extraction of hidden knowledge , can be useful for addressing the information needs of clinicians and biomedical researchers , and can assist with new research initiatives such as PheWAS . This is not feasible with simple PubMed searches . V . L IMITATIONS Currently , the individual terms in the relation trees are not mapped to concepts , which could potentially lead to ambiguity and redundancy . Second , the system uses an offline copy of the Medline database and updates once a week , which might not meet the information needs of all users . This can be amended readily . Third , currently the system generates 5 - ary trees with only three levels . Although this restricts the size of the tree to a manageable size , increasing the nodes and depth of the tree can improve summarization and discovery process . Fourth , the validation of the Lit - PheWAS was conducted for only a small set of genetic variants . Further validation is required to evaluate the generalizability of the system for Lit - PheWAS using more genetic variants . Future work will focus on increasing the scalability of the system to more complex tree structures ( more nodes , more levels ) and incorporation of PubTator BioConcepts for addressing the redundancy and ambiguity issues . We expect more sophisticated relational theory will also be explored to integrate the large amount of concepts and knowledge into meaningful summary . VI . CONCLUSIONS SEACOIN 2 . 0 includes improved methods for document retrieval , information extraction / relation mining , summarization , and generating co - occurrence networks to discover and visualize complex relationships among biomedical terms . We demonstrate herein that SEACOIN2 . 0 can be used to retrieve PubMed articles that are most relevant to a query of interest and to generate a collective summary of the previously published studies . The multi - level relation discovery and summarization steps allow visualization of direct and indirect relationships between genes , SNPs , chemicals , diseases , and other biomedical entities . We evaluate the performance of the system using the BioCreative IV Track 3 corpus . We also demonstrate the ability of the system to perform literature - based discovery and literature - based PheWAS . Hence , the updated SEACOIN system enhances the capacity to extract and summarize knowledge from different articles and helps generate hypotheses for future experiments , which is otherwise hard to accomplish using a simple PubMed search . Further studies will be conducted along with biologists in testing some of the potential new hypotheses identified by the system . A .
