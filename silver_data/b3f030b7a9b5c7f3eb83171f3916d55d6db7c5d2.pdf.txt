The cellular entry of JEV is poorly characterized in terms 19 of molecular requirements and pathways . Here we present a systematic study of the 20 internalization mechanism of JEV in fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells . To verify the role 21 of distinct pathways of cell entry , we used fluorescently labelled virus particles , a 22 combination of pharmacological inhibitors , RNA intereference ( RNAi ) and dominant 23 negative ( dn ) mutants of regulatory proteins involved in endocytosis . Our study demonstrates 24 that JEV infects fibroblasts in a clathrin dependent manner , but it deploys a clathrin 25 independent mechanism to infect neuronal cells . The clathrin independent pathway requires 26 dynamin and plasma membrane cholesterol . Virus binding to neuronal cells leads to rapid 27 actin rearrangements , and an intact and dynamic actin cytoskeleton , and the small GTPase 28 RhoA plays an important role in viral entry . Immunofluorescence analysis of viral 29 colocalization with endocytic markers showed that JEV trafficks through Rab5 positive early 30 endosomes and release of the viral nucleocapsid occurs at the level of the early and not the 31 late endosomes . 32 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 3 Introduction 33 Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) belongs to the genus Flavivirus in the family 34 Flaviviridae . Other members of the genus include Dengue virus ( DENV ) , West Nile virus 35 ( WNV ) , Yellow fever virus ( YFV ) , and Tick - borne encephalitis virus ( TBEV ) . Most 36 flaviruses are transmitted by mosquito or tick vectors and cause serious human and animal 37 disease ( 46 ) . JEV is a major cause of epidemic encephalitis worldwide , with a potential to 38 cause permanent neuropsychatric sequelae and is sometimes fatal in children living in 39 endemic areas such as Southeast Asia . JEV transmission has also been observed in the 40 Southern Hemisphere and has the potential to become a worldwide public health threat ( 49 , 41 69 ) . 42 JEV particles are small ( ~ 50 nm ) , in which a glycoprotein - containing lipid envelope 43 surrounds the capsid , which has a single - stranded positive - sense 11 - kb RNA genome . The 44 viral RNA encodes a single open reading frame carrying genes for three structural proteins - 45 capsid ( C ) , premembrane ( prM ) and envelope ( E ) , and seven non - structural ( NS ) proteins - 46 NS1 , NS2a , NS2b , NS3 , NS4a , NS4b , and NS5 ( 46 ) . The E glycoprotein is the major 47 antigenic determinant on flavivirus particles , which mediates binding and fusion during virus 48 entry ( 7 , 41 ) . After internalization , flaviviruses are trafficked to an endosomal compartment 49 where low pH induces conformational changes necessary for virus uncoating and capsid 50 disassembly ( 31 ) . 51 Clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is believed to be the major route of flavivirus 52 cell entry . The earliest evidence for this was obtained from ultrastructural studies showing the 53 presence of Kunjin and YFV in coated pits ( 32 , 63 ) . Subsequently DENV and WNV have 54 also been shown to infect mosquito cells via CME ( 3 , 18 , 55 ) . Single particle tracking of 55 dengue virus in live cells has demonstrated virus movement along the cell surface in a 56 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 4 diffusive manner before it is captured by a pre - existing clathrin coated pit ( 80 ) . Till date only 57 one study has reported an alternate clathrin independent infectious entry pathway for DENV - 58 2 in mammalian cells ( 1 ) . Using biochemical inhibitors and dominant negative mutants , entry 59 of DENV - 1 was demonstrated to be clathrin dependent , while that of DENV - 2 was clathrin , 60 cholesterol and caveolin independent in Vero cells . In contrast , DENV - 2 entry in A549 cells 61 was clathrin dependent , as previously reported for HeLa , C6 / 36 and BS - C - 1 cells ( 2 ) . It is 62 possible that the entry pathway ( s ) utilized by the virus maybe cell type dependent . Two 63 recent RNA interference studies for Dengue virus entry and multiplication into monocytes 64 and HepG2 cells show dependence on clathrin heavy chain and dyamin - 2 ( 5 , 6 ) . 65 The cell biology of JEV entry remains relatively unexplored . An electron - microscopy 66 study showed that JEV is transported across cerebral blood vessels and breaches the blood 67 brain barrier , and both coated and uncoated vesicles could be seen in the capillary 68 endothelium ( 47 ) . Data in support of a clathrin mediated pathway for JEV internalization is 69 limited mainly to pharmacological studies using the inhibitor chlorpromazine ( 62 ) and use of 70 dominant negative constructs of Eps15 , a key protein involved in CME ( 24 ) . It has also been 71 shown that Bafilomycin , a specific inhibitor of vaculoar type H + - ATPase , interfered with 72 JEV infection of Vero cells ( 61 ) . 73 In addition to CME , several endocytic pathways that do not use clathrin have also 74 been described ( 43 , 66 ) . At least three clathrin - independent internalization pathways have 75 been reported in mammalian cells , but they are not yet completely characterized ( 39 , 52 ) . 76 These pathways vary in cargoes they transport and in the protein machinery that facilitates 77 the endocytic process . Some of these pathways are constitutive , whereas others are triggered 78 by specific signals or are hijacked by viruses ( 50 ) . Considerable plasticity exists in these 79 endocytic mechanisms and certain components such as dynamin - 2 , Rho GTPases and actin 80 can participate in more than one pathway . The large GTPase dynamin - 2 was originally noted 81 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 5 for its role in severing clathrin - coated vesicles from the plasma membrane and was 82 subsequently found to be involved in a clathrin independent pathway mediated by caveolae 83 ( 66 ) . In addition , some members of the ADP - ribosylation factor ( Arf ) and Rho subfamilies of 84 small GTPases were recently suggested to play key roles in regulating clathrin independent 85 endocytic pathways ( 58 ) . Rho GTPases are also known to be involved in the control of actin 86 dynamics ( 33 ) . Dynamin - 2 and F - actin are crucial to most endocytic processes that coexist 87 within the cell . These common factors must be tightly controlled and perhaps differentially 88 regulated according to the endocytic mechanism . 89 It is now being increasingly appreciated that many viruses can utilize more than one 90 entry pathway to infect cells ( 34 , 50 ) . There have been many recent studies showing that 91 viruses can induce macropinocytosis for productive entry and infection ( 25 , 54 , 71 ) . Here , we 92 address the role of different endocytic molecules and pathways involved in JEV 93 internalization in Vero ( green monkey kidney fibroblasts ) , Neuro2a ( mouse neuroblastoma ) 94 and SH - SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) cells . Using a combination of pharmacological and 95 molecular approaches , we show that a clathrin independent pathway operates in neuronal 96 cells for JEV infection . Dynamin - 2 , membrane cholesterol and a dynamic actin cytoskeleton 97 are specifically required for neuronal cell entry and infection of JEV . In addition , the small 98 GTPase Rho A and myosin II motors aid JEV internalization . Immunofluorescence analysis 99 of viral colocalization with endocytic markers showed that JEV is trafficked to Rab5 positive 100 early endosomes where membrane fusion occurs . The infection process in both fibroblasts 101 and neuronal cells requires acid dependent fusion at the level of the early endosomes . 102 103 Materials and Methods 104 Cells , antibodies , inhibitors and plasmids 105 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 6 Mouse neuroblastoma ( Neuro2a ) and human neuroblastoma ( SH - SY5Y ) cells were grown in 106 Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal 107 bovine serum ( FBS ) ( HyClone ) . Porcine stable kidney ( PS ) cells ( National Center for Cell 108 Sciences , Pune , India ) and Vero ( African green monkey kidney ) cells were grown in Eagle’s 109 minimal essential medium ( MEM ) with 10 % FBS . All media was additionally supplemented 110 with 100µg / ml penicillin / streptomycin and 2mM L - glutamine . Antibodies to JEV - E , actin 111 ( loading control ) and myc were from Abcam . CHC antibody was from Cell Signaling 112 Technology , and CLC antibody from Santa Cruz . All inhibitors - chlorpromazine 113 hydrochloride , dynasore , EIPA ( 5 - N - ethyl - N - isoproamiloride ) , methyl - β - cyclodextrin , filipin , 114 cytochalasin D , latrunculin A , jasplakinolide , blebbistatin and bafilomycin were purchased 115 from Sigma . The chemical inhibitor for Rho A ( CT04 ) and the Rho , Rac , Cdc42 G - LISA 116 Activation Assay Biochem kits were purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc ( Denver , CO ) . All 117 chemical inhibitor stock solutions were prepared according to manufacturer’s directions . 118 Fluorescent dye - DiD , fluorophore coupled - transferrin , - phalloidin , - secondary anti - mouse 119 and anti - rabbit antibodies , and ProLong Gold anti - fade reagent with DAPI , were obtained 120 from Invitrogen Corporation . HRP coupled secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson 121 Immunochemicals . The Eps15 mutants : DIII δ 2 ( control ) , DIII all subcloned in pEGFP - C2 122 were kind gifts from Alexandre Benmerah ( Universite Paris , Paris , France ) ( 9 ) . Plasmids for 123 wild type ( wt ) , dominant active ( DA ) , dominant negative ( DN ) - Rho , Rac , Cdc42 , Rab5 , 124 Rab7 , and dyn - 2K44A were obtained from Addgene . The details are as follows - plasmids - 125 15899 , 15900 , 15901 , 15903 , 15904 , 15905 , 15906 , 15907 deposited by Alan Hall ( 64 ) ; 126 plasmids - 12660 , 12605 deposited by Richard Pagano ( 17 ) ; plasmid - 14437 deposited by Ari 127 Helenius ( 82 ) ; plasmid - 28045 deposited by Qing Zhong ( 78 ) ; plasmid - 34687 ( deposited by 128 Sandra Schmid ) . 129 Virus generation , purification and fluorescent labelling 130 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 7 For all studies JEV isolate Vellore P20778 generated in PS cells was used . The culture 131 supernatant was harvested when 75 % of the cells showed cytophatic effect , usually 36 - 48 h 132 after infection , and clarified by centrifugation at 1000xg for 30 min at 4 o C . Virus titres were 133 determined using monolayers of PS cells as described earlier ( 83 ) . Virus was further purified 134 over a 20 % sucrose cushion in a Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge ( Optima L - 100K ) at 80 , 000 135 x g for 4 hours at 4 o C . Purified virus was exchanged into PBS through cycles of 136 concentration by centrifugation ( 800 xg ) and dilution with PBS , using 50ml ultrafiltration 137 tubes ( 10kD , Amicon ) . Virus was labelled with DiD by injecting 2 nmol of dye into virus 138 stock under intensive vortexing for 10 min at RT . Excess dye was removed by purification 139 through Micro Spin TM G - 25 columns ( GE Healthcare ) . Labelling did not abolish viral 140 infectivity . Labelled virus was used immediately for experiments . 141 Cell transfection and transient expression 142 Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to manufacturers’ 143 protocols . For transfection , cells were grown to 60 - 70 % confluency on 18mm coverslips or 144 35mm coverslip dishes and transfected with 1µg DNA . Transfections were typically allowed 145 to proceed for 18 - 24 h before infection with JEV . 146 siRNA depletion experiments 147 Mouse specific clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) targeting shRNA plasmid DNAs 148 ( SHCLND _ NM _ 001003908 ) were purchased from Sigma . Best silencing efficiency was 149 observed with Clone NM _ 001003908 . 1 - 5688s1c1 containing the sequence - 150 CCGGGCCGACAAAGACAACACTAATCTCGAGATTAGTGTTGTCTTTGTCGGCTTT 151 TTG . Cells were transfected with shRNA plasmid and harvested at 24 , 48 , and 72 h to check 152 for protein knock - down . Significant depletion of CHC was observed at 72 h . For clathrin 153 light chain ( CLC ) depletion a shRNA construct was generated by cloning appropriate 154 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 8 oligonucleotides containing the targeting sequence in the pSIREN - RetoQZsGreen plasmid 155 ( Clontech ) . The sequence of the forward primer oligonucleotides designed for the CLC 156 shRNA was GATCCGGAGCCTGAAAGTATCCGTATTCAAGAGATACGGATACTTTC 157 AGGCTCTTTTTTGTCGACG . This sequence of the clathrin light chain targeted in the 158 shRNA construct is evolutionarily conserved from rodents to primates . The GFP - CLCshRNA 159 clone was used for gene silencing in both Neuro2a and Vero cells . This construct confers the 160 additional advantage that cells receiving the shRNA also express GFP . A time course of CLC 161 depletion was done and maximal protein knock - down was observed at 72 h . Cell lysates were 162 run on SDS - PAGE and western blotting was done for CLC , CHC and actin . For infection 163 experiments , cells were transfected with shRNA plasmids for either CHC or CLC for 72 h 164 following which they were infected with JEV . 165 Virus infection and cell treatment 166 Neuro2a cells seeded on 35mm coverslip dishes or 18mm coverslips were either transfected 167 as described above or treated with inhibitors prior to infection . The incubation time , dosage 168 and cell viability upon treatment was determined for each inhibitor . For all inhibitors the final 169 DMSO concentration never exceeded more than 0 . 2 % of the total culture medium . Cells were 170 infected with JEV at MOI 0 . 4 for 1 h at 37 o C with or without inhibitors . For experiments 171 involving dynasore , cells were grown in 10 % Nuserum ( BD Biosciences ) containing media . 172 For cholesterol depletion cells were washed four to five times with serum free medium before 173 addition of methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) or filipin . For Rho A inhibition , cells were serum 174 starved for 2 hours , and inhibitor - CT04 added to serum free media for 2 hours . For inhibitors 175 requiring serum free conditions infections were done using purified virus in PBS with 0 . 1 % 176 glucose . For experiments involving transfections cells were infected with JEV at MOI 1 177 ( results in about 30 % infection in GFP transfected cells ) for 1h at 37 o C . Following infection , 178 cells were washed twice with PBS and complete media was added . Cells were fixed 24 hours 179 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 9 post - infection ( hpi ) in 2 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilised using 0 . 4 % TritonX - 100 or 180 0 . 04 % saponin in PBS for 20 min at RT . Blocking was done with 2mg / ml BSA in PBS for 1 181 h prior to incubation with anti - JEV E antibody , followed by Alexa488 / 568 anti - mouse 182 secondary antibody . For transfection experiments using over - expression constructs of myc - 183 tagged Rho , Rac and Cdc42 , cells were processed for double immunostaining with antibodies 184 against Myc epitope tag and JEV E antigen . 185 Virus colocalization studies 186 For transferrin and JEV colocalization studies , labelled virus ( MOI 10 ) was allowed to bind 187 cells on ice for 1h . After virus binding , cells were incubated with labelled Tf for 5 , 10 , and , 188 15 min at 37 o C . For colocalization with dsRed - Rab5 , and GFP - Rab7 , labelled virus binding 189 to cells was done on ice for 1h , after which cells were warmed to 37 o C for the specified time 190 points . Cells were given a low pH wash ( 0 . 1M sodium acetate , 0 . 05M NaCl , pH5 . 5 , 5min ) to 191 remove cell sticking virus particles , fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde and imaged . 192 Immunofluorescence microscopy and image processing 193 Confocal microscopy was performed using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope . For 194 quantification of entry , images were acquired with 20X Plan Apo objective , NA 1 . 20 . Images 195 were acquired for 8 - 10 fields of view per coverslip . Quantification of JEV infection was done 196 by counting cells that were immune - stained versus non - stained for virus envelope ( E ) 197 antigen . For experiments involving transfections , quantitation was done by counting cells that 198 were both transfected and infected versus those that were transfected but remained 199 uninfected . The infection studies were normalized to either solvent treated or GFP expressing 200 controls . All experiments were done in duplicate or triplicate . Results are expressed as mean 201 ± SD . Significance was determined using a Student T - test . For colocalization experiments , 202 images were acquired with a 60X PlanApo objective lens ( NA 1 . 4 ) . Z - stacks were acquired at 203 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 10 0 . 25µm per slice by sequential scanning . FluoView software ( Olympus ) was used to generate 204 cross - sectional and maximum intensity projection images . 205 Quantitative real - time ( qRT ) PCR 206 Neuro2a cells were plated in 35mm dishes at a density of 0 . 5x10 6 cells / dish and were pre - 207 treated with inhibitors . Viral adsorption ( MOI 10 ) to cells was performed at 4 o C for 1h , 208 followed by one wash with cold PBS , and a shift to 37 o C for 1h in the presence of inhibitor . 209 Post incubation , cells were washed with chilled PBS and low pH buffer and lysed in Trizol 210 reagent ( Invitogen ) . qRT - PCR primers were procured from Sigma . JEV positive strand 211 cDNA was generated using the following primer - AATAAGTTGTAGTTGGGCACTCTG . 212 JEV was amplified using the following probes - Taqman probe : 213 CCACGCCACTCGACCCATAGACTG ( 5’ end FAM , 3’end TAMRA ) , 5’ primer : 214 AGAGCACCAAGGGAATGAAATAGT , 3’ primer : 215 AATAAGTTGTAGTTGGGCACTCTG . GAPDH was used as an internal control - Taqman 216 probe sequence : ACAACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTAGC ( 5’ end FAM , 3’end TAMRA ) , 5’ 217 primer : CCTGCCAAGTATGATGAC , 3’ primer : GGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTC . The PCR 218 conditions were as follows : 94 o C for 2min ( 1 cycle ) , 94 o C for 15 sec , 55 o C for 30sec and 219 72 o C for 1min ( 40 cycles ) . qPCR was done on Applied Biosystems ABI 7500 . 220 Quantification of Transferrin uptake by flow cytometry and microscopy 221 Transferrin internalization by cells after treatment with chlorpromazine was measured by 222 flow cytometry . Cells pre - treated with 25µM or 50µM chlorpromazine were given a 10 min 223 pulse of Alexa488 - Tf in labelling medium ( DMEM or MEM 10 % serum ) . After incubation , 224 excess label was washed off with chilled PBS and low pH buffer to remove surface bound 225 Tf . Cells were fixed , detached and Alexa488 fluorescence was analysed using a Becton 226 Dickinson ( BD ) FACSCantoII flow cytometer . The average of measured geometric means of 227 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 11 internalized Tf in control and inhibitor treated cells was calculated . For quantification of 228 transferrin uptake in cells transfected with different endocytic mutants / CLC shRNA , a pulse 229 of Alexa568 / 647 Tf was given for 10 min in labelling medium . Cells were processed as 230 described above , fixed and imaged at 20X . Total fluorescence intensity was calculated per 231 cell using Olympus FV1000 analysis software . In each experiment fluorescence was 232 calculated from 10 - 12 fields of view from duplicate slides for each transfection condition . 233 Integrated values of cell fluorescence were corrected for background autofluorescence . Tf 234 uptake is represented as Mean and standard error of the mean of integerated fluorescence 235 intensity from two independent experiments . 236 Rho GTPase activation assays 237 Neuro2a cells were transfected with Wt , DA , DN plasmids of Rho , Rac and Cdc42 . 238 Rho , and Cdc42 activation was measured 24h post - transfection with G - LISA activation kit 239 ( Kit # BK124 , Kit # BK 127 Cytoskeleton Inc . ) . To measure Rac activation , mock , Rac DA 240 and Rac DN transfected cells were serum starved for 24h , followed by addition of complete 241 media for 10min before washing with cold PBS and lysis ( Kit # BK125 ) . To measure Rho 242 activation in response to virus binding , JEV ( 10MOI ) was adsorbed to cells at 4 o C for 1h , 243 followed by one wash with cold PBS , and a shift to 37 o C to allow infection until indicated 244 times . Cells were washed with cold PBS , lysed and processed for ELISA . The activated form 245 of the G - protein was detected by incubation with specific primary antibody followed by a 246 secondary antibody conjugated to HRP and a detection reagent . The signal was read by 247 measuring absorbance at 490nm using a microplate reader . 248 249 Results 250 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 12 JEV internalization is dynamin - 2 dependent 251 Dynamin - 2 is a large GTPase which acts by mediating release of newly - formed 252 endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane . It thus plays a critical role in CME as well as 253 some of the non - clathrin dependent pathways ( 26 ) . To examine the role of dynamin - 2 in JEV 254 entry in different cell lines , the effect of dynasore , a potent and specific dynamin - 2 inhibitor 255 was tested ( 48 ) . Neuro2a , SH - SY5Y and Vero cells treated with 80µM dynasore showed 256 close to 90 % block in JEV infection ( Figure 1A , C , D ) . At 80µM , dynasore specifically 257 blocks dynamin - 2 function , which was confirmed via a significant inhibition in 258 internalization of transferrin ( Tf ) , a cargo that gets internalized via the dynamin and clathrin 259 dependent endocytic mechanism . To confirm that dynasore is blocking JEV endocytosis and 260 not inhibiting any downstream event necessary for infection , qRT - PCR of JEV positive 261 strand RNA was performed 1hpi to estimate viral entry in untreated and dynasore treated 262 Neuro2acells . There was a 70 % decrease in the viral load in dynasore treated cells relative to 263 control ( Figure 1B ) , implying that JEV endocytosis is likely to require functional dynamin . 264 We next tested the ability of a plasmid expressing the dominant - negative - K44A 265 mutant of dynamin - 2 ( dyn2K44A ( 22 ) ) to block JEV infection . Neuro2a cells were 266 transfected with either control GFP plasmid ( Figure 1E , left panel ) or GFPdyn2K44A ( Figure 267 1E , right panel ) and 24 h later infected with JEV . Infected cells were immunostained for 268 JEV - E protein . Whereas , cells expressing GFP alone were infected with JEV ( Figure 1E , left 269 panel ) , those expressing the dyn2K44A mutant showed nearly a 70 % block in infection 270 ( Figure 1E right panel & quantitation in Figure 1F ) . This observation was also confirmed in 271 SH - SY5Y and Vero cells ( Figure 1F ) . These experiments thus suggest that JEV 272 internalization in cells is dynamin - 2 dependent . 273 JEV internalization is independent of clathrin mediated endocytic cargo 274 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 13 Since JEV infection was dynamin dependent , we examined the role of clathrin in the 275 internalization process . Transferrin , which binds to the transferrin receptor , is a well 276 characterized cargo of clathrin coated pits , and served as a control in these studies . 277 As a first approach we used fluorescently labelled virus particles to follow endocytic 278 internalization of JEV . To detect single JEV particle entry events in Neuro2a cells , we 279 labelled virions with membrane - permeable liophilic dye DiD . This approach has been used 280 successfully with Dengue , Influenza and Hepatitis C virus ( 21 , 42 , 80 ) . A homogeneously 281 labelled particle suspension was obtained as indicated by confocal microscopy of labelled 282 particles attached to glass coverslips ( Figure 2A , left panel ) . A majority of the DiD - labelled 283 viral particles have uniform fluorescence emissions . To confirm that the DiD signal is 284 specific to labelled JEV particles , we immuno - stained DID - JEV with JEV - envelope antibody 285 ( Figure 2A , middle and left panel , insets ) . There was no significant loss in infectivity of DiD 286 labelled virus particles as tested by plaque assays ( Figure 2B ) . 287 DiD - JEV was allowed to bind to Neuro2a cells on ice for 1 h followed by pulse with 288 labelled Tf for different time points . By 10 min virus particles can be seen associated with the 289 cell body with several virus particles attached to filopodia ( Figure 2C , upper right panel , 290 arrowheads ) . At this time point no co - localization of the internalized virus particles is seen 291 with Tf ( Fig 2C , upper left panel , arrowheads ) . Virus internalization was a slow process and 292 the virus containing vesicles remained segregated from Tf endosomes till 15 min post entry . 293 ( Figure 2B , lower left panel , arrowheads ) . After 30 min of internalization there was about 294 50 % co - localization between virus and Tf endosomes and could this could imply presence of 295 the virus in Rab5 early endosomes ( Fig 2B , lower right panel , arrows ) . Virus entry in 296 Neuro2a cells appeared to be independent of Tf endocytosis , since most of the internalized 297 virus was seen in vesicles that did not co - localize with Tf endosomes at early time points . 298 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 14 JEV entry in Neuro2a cells is clathrin independent 299 The role of clathrin mediated endocytosis in JEV infection was further tested by 300 employing different strategies to disrupt the pathway . Chlorpromazine is commonly used to 301 inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis , however , this drug also elicits other secondary effects 302 on the cell , including inhibition of voltage gated potassium channels in neuronal cells , and 303 inhibition of lysosomal and cytosolic phospholipases ( 51 , 72 ) . Studies have shown that 304 chlorpromazine can inhibit JEV infection of Vero cells ( 62 ) . We tested this effect of 305 chlorpromazine on Neuro2a , SH - SY5Y and Vero cells . A concentration of 50µM was chosen 306 for infection studies as this dosage showed maximum ( nearly 50 % or more for Neuro2a , SH - 307 SY5Y and 35 % for Vero ) inhibition in Tf uptake in all three cell lines ( Figure 3A ) , and 308 exposure to higher drug concentrations lead to significant cell death . While there was greater 309 than 60 % block in JEV infection of Vero cells , there was no significant inhibition of infection 310 of Neuro2a and SH - SY5Y cells ( Figure 3B , D ) . Treatment of Neuro2a cells with 311 chlorpromazine also did not have any effect on the amount of JEV endocytosed as calculated 312 by qRT - PCR ( Figure 3C ) . This data suggests that JEV entry is likely to be cell type 313 dependent . 314 The role of clathrin mediated endocytosis was further tested by the expression of GFP 315 tagged dominant negative ( dn ) Eps15 mutants . Eps15 is a crucial component of clathrin - 316 coated pits where it interacts with adaptor protein ( AP ) - 2 , the major clathrin adaptor 317 complex . Clathrin mediated endocytosis can be blocked by overexpression of the dn Eps15 318 mutant - DIII , which has a large N - terminal deletion leaving only its C - teminal DIII domain 319 intact ( 9 ) . The DIII mutant with an additional deletion of its AP - 2 binding sites ( DIII δ 2 ) , was 320 used as a control to monitor over - expression effects . Overexpression of the dn Eps15 321 decreased transferrin internalization in Neuro2a cells by around 50 % ( Figure 4A vs 4B , 322 quantitation in Figure 4C ) . However , when cells over - expressing the dn Eps15 mutant and 323 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 15 control plasmids were infected with JEV , there was a significant block in infection in Vero 324 cells whereas Neuro2a and SH - SY5Y showed infection comparable to control ( Figure 4D , E ) . 325 These results imply that JEV internalization in neuronal cells can occur independently of the 326 clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway . 327 To further dissect the clathrin independent endocytic mechanism in neuronal cells we 328 focussed on the cell line Neuro2a along with Vero fibroblasts . The main components of 329 clathrin - coated pits and vesicles are clathrin triskelions , consisting of three heavy and three 330 light chains . To specifically inhibit clathrin mediated endocytosis , we used siRNA to 331 knockdown the expression of both clathrin light chain ( CLC ) and clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) 332 in independent experiments . Both siRNAs have been previously used to inhibit clathrin - 333 mediated endocytosis ( 56 ) . CLC was depleted by use of a GFP - tagged shRNA construct that 334 targets a evolutionarily conserved region of the gene . Over - expression of this construct in 335 Neuro2a cells showed a significant inhibition ( ~ 60 % ) of Tf internalization in GFP positive 336 cells by 72 hours ( Figure 5A , compare left panel - mock transfected vs right panel - CLC 337 shRNA transfected , quantitation in Figure 5B ) and nearly 90 % of CLC was depleted from 338 cells as tested by Western blotting in both Neuro2a and Vero cells ( Figure 5C ) . Neuro2a cells 339 depleted of CLC did not show any reduction in JEV infection , compared to cells transfected 340 with shRNA vector alone , whereas Vero cells showed close to 50 % inhibition of infection 341 ( Figure 5D , E ) . Depletion of CHC in Neuro2a cells ( Figure 5F ) also did not show any 342 significant decrease in JEV infection compared to mock transfected cells ( Figure 5G , H ) . 343 These experiments strongly suggest that JEV internalization in mouse neuroblastoma cells 344 can occur efficiently via a clathrin independent mechanism . 345 Cholesterol is required for JEV infection 346 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 16 Since a number of viral entry pathways depend on cholesterol , we next examined 347 whether JEV internalization was sensitive to lowering membrane cholesterol levels , which is 348 a major determinant of many endocytic processes ( 65 ) . Though several studies imply the 349 requirement of cholesterol to be an indicator of caveolar / lipid - raft endocytosis , cholesterol - 350 dependence of cell entry is an operational definition and does not imply a specific pathway of 351 entry ( 52 ) . Most endocytic pathways are sensitive to cholesterol perturbation , with both 352 clathrin - dependent ( 70 , 77 ) and clathrin - independent pathways ( 15 , 16 , 58 ) being inhibited by 353 removal of cholesterol . Also cargo like the virus SV40 and cholera toxin B that were earlier 354 believed to be markers for caveolar endocytosis , can be internalized via caveolin independent 355 pathways ( 23 , 38 ) . Thus the definition of a caveolar endocytic pathway in terms of its 356 specific cargo is now redundant . 357 For the Dengue and West Nile flaviviruses , cholesterol was shown to be required for 358 infection ( 44 , 53 , 68 ) . Mouse neural stem / progenitor cells depleted of cholesterol before JEV 359 infection also showed a reduction in viral load and infective virus particle production ( 24 ) . In 360 contrast , another study showed an increase in JEV infection upon treatment of Huh - 7 cells 361 with methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( 79 ) . 362 Our experiments demonstrated that membrane cholesterol was required for JEV 363 infection of both neuronal cells and fibroblasts . Cholesterol depletion was done by treating 364 cells with methyl - β - cyclodextrin , a drug that selectively extracts cholesterol from the plasma 365 membrane ( 37 ) , or with filipin , a compound that binds selectively to cholesterol , forming 366 complexes in the plasma membrane that sequester cholesterol and induce structural disorder 367 ( 10 ) . Cells were treated with 5mM and 7 . 5mM methyl - β - cyclodextrin , or with 0 . 5µM and 368 1µM filipin before infecting them with JEV . Both treatments resulted in a marked inhibition 369 ( 60 % or greater ) of JEV infection highlighting an essential role for cholesterol in both 370 clathrin dependent and clathrin independent endocytosis of JEV in different cell lines ( Figure 371 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 17 6A ) . Quantitative RT - PCR also showed an inhibition of JEV endocytosis in cholesterol 372 depleted Neuro2a cells ( Figure 6B ) . 373 JEV binding on cells leads to active actin rearrangements 374 The actin cytoskeleton is an important regulator of all membrane processes . Studies 375 have shown that upon interaction with filopodia , several viruses like HIV , MLV and VSVG 376 undergo rapid actin - and myosin II - driven transport , “surfing” to entry sites at the cell body 377 ( 45 ) . To test whether JEV binding and infection events lead to any global actin 378 rearrangements , virus was added to Neuro2a cells for different times and actin was observed 379 via phalloidin staining . Uninfected cell surfaces were smooth and showed a clear margin with 380 peripheral F - actin staining and random filopodial projections ( Figure 7A , upper left panel ) . 381 As early as 3 min post - infection several cells showed increased intensity of cortical actin 382 structures and filopodial projections ( Figure 7A , upper right panel ) , which increased with 383 time ( Figure 7A , lower panels ) . By 5 min post - infection several cells showed a dramatic 384 increase in the number of filopodia that showed a regular arrangement around the cell 385 periphery ( Figure 7A , lower left panel ) . This effect peaked at 10 min post - infection ( Figure 386 7A , lower right panel ) . This increased distribution of filopodia on cells is likely to represent 387 induction of an efficient infectious pathway brought about by some signalling event initiated 388 by virus binding . 389 JEV entry in neuronal cells is actin and myosin II dependent 390 The induction of actin - rich filopodia on cells after virus binding , imply that viral - 391 entry is likely to be an actin and motor - driven process . We further examined the role of the 392 actin cytoskeleton in JEV entry by using chemical inhibitors of actin polymerization and 393 depolymerization . Cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) reversibly targets barbed ends of F - actin , 394 inducing depolymerisation of existing filaments and increasing the cellular pool of ADP - 395 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 18 bound actin monomers ( 30 ) . Latrunculin A reversibly disrupts actin dynamics by targeting 396 monomeric G - actin and preventing actin polymerization ( 75 ) . Treatment of cells with CytoD 397 at a concentration of 5µM and 2 . 5µM , showed a 70 % block in JEV infection in Neuro2a 398 cells , and a 20 % decrease in Vero cells ( Figure 7B ) . Similarly , treatment with Latrunculin at 399 concentrations of 5µM and 2 . 5µM significantly reduced JEV infection in Neuro2a cells while 400 having a marginal effect in Vero cells ( Figure 7B ) . To block turnover of actin microfilament 401 we used a cell permable drug jasplankinolide , that selectively binds to F - actin , and 402 dramatically decreases rate of actin depolymerization ( 12 ) . Treatment with jasplankinolide at 403 concentrations ranging from 0 . 5 to 2µM resulted in about 80 % inhibition of JEV infection in 404 Neuro2a cells ( Figure 7B ) . We also confirmed that these drugs block JEV entry inside cells 405 by qPCR ( Figure 7C ) . Collectively , our pharmacological and immunofluorescence labelling 406 data strongly suggests that the dynamic reorganization ( depolymerization / reploymerization ) 407 of actin microfilaments is critical for JEV entry in neuronal cells . 408 We further examined whether myosin driven contractions would provide the 409 mechanical force for JEV infection process . It has been shown that myosin motors are 410 involved in movement of actin filaments in cell surface protrusions ( 67 ) , a process known as 411 rearward or retrograde F - actin flow . Nonmuscle myosin II is a plus - end motor that localizes 412 to the lamellum and retraction fibres , and is involved in viral surfing on filopodia . Since 413 myosin II is an important contributor to the cytoskeleton of neuronal cells , and may influence 414 the trafficking of JEV , we tested its involvement in viral entry by using its specific inhibitor 415 blebbistatin ( 76 ) . Blebbistatin interferes neither with binding of myosin to actin nor with 416 ATP - induced actomyosin dissociation , but blocks myosin II in an actin detached state . 417 Treatment of cells with blebbistatin ( 50µM ) resulted in about 50 % block in JEV infection in 418 Neuro2a cells and a 30 % block in Vero cells ( Figure 6B , C ) . These results suggest that 419 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 19 myosin is essential for infection and JEV entry may involve virus movement along filopodia 420 to the cell body utilizing the underlying actin - mysoin II machinery . 421 Role of the small GTPases in JEV infection 422 We next examined the role of the Rho family of small GTPases - Rho , Rac and Cdc42 423 that are involved in spatio - temporal control of actin polymerization and also play a regulatory 424 role in endocytic processes ( 27 ) . To dissect the effects of individual Rho family GTPases we 425 expressed wild - type , dominant - negative and dominant - active isoforms of RhoA , Rac1 and 426 Cdc42 and tested their activity in cells ( Figure 8A , B , C ) . While the dominant - active isoforms 427 showed several fold higher GTPase activity over wild - type , the dominant - negative isoforms 428 showed close to 50 % decrease in GTPase activity when over - expressed . These constructs 429 were expressed in Neuro2a cells and checked for their effect in the JEV infection process . 430 Cells expressing myc - tagged isoforms of RhoAwt , Cdc42wt , Cdc42N17 ( DN ) , 431 Cdc42L61 ( DA ) , Rac1L61 ( DA ) and Rac1N17 ( DN ) had roughly equal efficiency of JEV 432 infection . Only the RhoA - N19 ( DN ) isoform showed about a 50 % reduction in JEV infection 433 ( Figure 8D ) . The dominant active RhoA ( L63 ) had a minor effect and reduced JEV infection 434 by about 20 % . This could be because of decreased GTP - GDP turnover rates of endogenous 435 Rhowt protein in the background of over - expression of dominant active DA . As an 436 alternative we also tested the effect of CT04 , a specific RhoA inhibitor ( 8 , 13 ) . The active site 437 of CT04 is the exoenzyme C3 Transferase from Clostridium botulinum . CT04 specifically 438 inhibits RhoA , B and C proteins by ADP - ribosylation on asparagine 41 in the effector 439 binding domain of the GTPase ( 4 ) . Rho inhibition by CT04 was tested in Neuro2a cells by 440 cell morphology phenotypes and phalloidin staining . Cells treated with CT04 at a 441 concentration of 2µg / ml showed close to 60 % block in JEV infection and a 50 % block in 442 JEV entry , strongly suggesting the involvement of RhoA in the JEV endocytic internalization 443 process in neuronal cells ( Figure 8F , G ) . 444 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 20 Since RhoA appeared to play a critical role in viral infection , we investigated the 445 activation status of RhoA during the initial stages of JEV entry in Neuro2a cells . JEV 446 ( 10MOI ) was used to infect cells , and Rho activation was measured with the G - LISA Rho 447 activation kit following the maufacturer’s instructions . The results showed that Rho 448 activation is an immediate and robust event during JEV entry , reaching a maximum ( close to 449 2 fold ) at 10mpi compared to mock infected cells ( Figure 8E ) . This result further corroborates 450 that JEV entry induces RhoA activation in neuronal cells . 451 JEV infection requires passage through Rab5 positive early endosomes , but is 452 independent of Rab7 453 It is established that all flaviviruses require acidification in the endosome for 454 uncoating and release of the viral nucleic acid for replication ( 55 , 60 ) . We confirmed that 455 JEV entry in Neuro2a cells was acid dependent , as pre - treatment of cells with 100 - 200nM 456 Bafilomycin A1 - a drug that is a potent inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase and specifically 457 prevents acidification of endosomal vesicles ( 11 ) , led to about 95 % decrease in JEV infection 458 in both Neuro2a and Vero cells ( Figure 9B ) . 459 Rab proteins are known to orchestrate membrane traffic in the cell , and show distinct 460 localizations to specific subcellular compartments . Cargo from CME is sorted into early 461 endosomes that are marked by Rab5 and EEA1 . From the early endosomes molecules are 462 either sorted for recycling or directed to late endosomes that are Rab7 and LAMP1 positive . 463 Endosomes carrying cargo internalized via clathrin independent pathways also fuse with 464 Rab5 positive early endosomes ( 35 , 59 ) . Studies with Dengue virus have demonstrated that 465 the virus moves from Rab5 positive early endosomes to Rab7 positive late endosomes before 466 viral RNA is released in the cytoplasm ( 55 , 80 ) . West Nile virus was also shown to traffic 467 from EEA1 positive early endosomes to LAMP1 positive late endosomes where virus 468 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 21 uncoating finally occurred ( 18 , 19 ) . In contrast , another study based on RNA interference 469 showed entry of Dengue and West Nile virus to be dependent on Rab5 but not on Rab7 , 470 indicating that virus uncoating occurs at the level of early endosomes ( 40 ) . 471 To investigate the endocytic trail followed by JEV , DiD labelled virus was allowed to 472 bind to Neuro2a cells transfected with either dsRed - Rab5 or GFP - Rab7 , on ice for 1 hour , 473 and then incubated at 37 o C for different time points to follow virus internalization in the cell . 474 Virus internalization was a slow process and virus particles were seen in endosomes distinct 475 from Rab5 till 20 min of internalization ( Figure 8A , upper panels ) . After 30 min of uptake 476 virus containing vesicles had acquired / fused with Rab5 endosomes ( Figure 8A , lower left 477 panel , arrowheads ) . By 1h of internalization virus signal significantly decreased and was no 478 longer detectable inside the cell . Labelled virus particles were not detected in GFP - Rab7 479 positive late endosomes at any time point , indicating virus fusion is happening at a level 480 upstream of Rab7 late endosomes ( Figure 8A , lower right panel ) . 481 To further confirm this observation , Neuro2a and Vero cells were transfected with 482 GFP - dnRab5 or GFP - dnRab7 for 24 h and virus infection was monitored . Whereas cells 483 transfected with dnRab5 showed about 90 % block in JEV infection , cells transfected with 484 dnRab7 showed no significant inhibition . This indicates that JEV fusion occurs at the level of 485 the early endosome and not the late endosome ( Figure 9C ) . 486 Discussion 487 Current knowledge indicates that a complex network of diverse , continuing and 488 triggered pathways operate at the eukaryotic plasma membrane . Cargo specificity , coat 489 proteins and scission molecules are used to define most of these mechanisms . The orderly 490 transport of endocytic cargo is tightly regulated and requires the participation of numerous 491 lipids and accessory proteins . Endocytosis also requires alterations of fine cellular structures 492 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 22 and mechanical force to internalize a vesicle . Viruses are adept at exploiting these 493 mechanisms for gaining entry ( 50 ) . Nearly all viruses utilize an endocytic mechanism to gain 494 entry into a permissive cell and establish infection . These pathways serve to deliver viruses 495 to vesicles and compartments conducive to viral membrane fusion and release of the core into 496 the cell cytoplasm at a site permissive to replication . The route of virus entry can differ 497 between cell types . In addition to utilizing the already operational endocytic pathways , in 498 several cases viruses can induce pathways conducive to entry by receptor binding and 499 signalling events . 500 The results presented here indicate that entry of JEV in neuronal cells involves 501 strategies different from those described for many other flaviviruses . JEV internalization 502 occurs through a clathrin independent mechanism , and the cellular factors needed for entry 503 are dynamin , cholesterol , dynamic actin cytoskeleton , the small GTPase RhoA and myosin II 504 motors . After endocytosis , the virus trafficks through Rab5 positive early endosomes which 505 are possibly the sites for viral uncoating and genome release . 506 The information currently available suggests that flavivirus internalization is clathrin 507 dependent . Studies have shown that JEV infection of Vero and neural stem / progenitor cells 508 can be inhibited by chlorpromazine ( 24 , 62 ) . We also observed a clathrin dependent pathway 509 for JEV infection in Vero cells . By depleting the key coat proteins - clathrin heavy chain and 510 clathrin light chain , our study clearly demonstrates that a clathrin independent pathway is 511 operational for JEV entry in neuronal cells . Neuronal cells are highly relevant for 512 investigating JEV infection , since JEV is primarily a neurotropic virus . It is likely that the 513 endocytic route followed by the virus is cell type dependent . 514 Cholesterol dependence is often considered to be a marker of caveolar / lipid - raft 515 mediated pathway ( 29 ) . However , cholesterol is essential for most membrane processes . For 516 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 23 flaviviruses as well , membrane cholesterol is a requirement for entry ( 24 , 53 ) . Our study with 517 different cell types shows that membrane cholesterol is an absolute requirement for JEV 518 internalization . 519 JEV was seen associated with filopodia and the cell body . Virus binding induced 520 dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton at the early stages of infection . Several 521 viruses activate small GTPases to form lamellipodia and filopodia in cells ( 20 , 28 ) . Our data 522 from experiments with drugs that alter actin organization show that both actin polymerization 523 and depolymerization are required during the virus infection cycle . Filopodia are connected 524 to the cortical actin network which , in association with myosin II , controls their contractility 525 at their base , and the motor activity of myosin II could be required for JEV infection . Our 526 results point out to a greater role for the actin cytoskeleton in early viral entry events in 527 neuronal cells . 528 After receptor binding , viruses undergo a period of diffusive or directed motion on the 529 plasma membrane , until they become confined ( 14 ) . Some viruses can move along filopodia 530 to internalization sites by receptor interaction with the actin cytoskeleton and retrograde flow 531 within filopodia ( 45 , 73 ) . The actin cytoskeleton plays a structural role in endocytosis . Its 532 dynamic nature is essential for its function . Existing actin filaments undergo severing and 533 depolymerisation in response to cellular requirements and stimuli , while new actin filaments 534 are polymerized from monomeric actin subunits and by branching off from existing 535 filaments . These processes are regulated by the Rho GTPases . Studies on Herpes viruses have 536 shown that RhoA can induce filopodia in infected cells ( 20 ) . Kaposi’s sarcoma - associated 537 herpesvirus ( KSHV ) entry induces RhoA GTPase , and rearrangements of both microtubules 538 and the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts ( 74 ) , and RhoA GTPase is also important for virus 539 entry in HEK293 cells ( 81 ) . Our study also points to an important role for RhoA in virus 540 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 24 entry . The binding of JEV to its specific receptor is likely to activate signalling of cells via 541 RhoA activation . 542 Several viruses induce macropinocytosis and use it as a route for internalization and 543 infection ( 25 , 36 , 54 , 57 ) . JEV binding and uptake in Neuro2a cells did not show 544 characteristics of macropinocytic uptake . Further JEV internalization was not affected by 545 treatment of cells with amiloride , an inhibitor that specifically blocks Na + / H + exchange and 546 macropinocytois ( data not shown ) . 547 The present findings provide the first evidence for a clathrin - independent , actin - 548 dependent pathway utilized by JEV for infection of neuronal cells . At least three clathrin - 549 independent mechanisms have been described at the plasma membrane , primarily on the 550 basis of cargo , dynamin dependence / independence , role of cellular factors like Arf and Rho 551 GTPases , actin and cholesterol requirements ( 39 , 52 ) . It is still unclear whether JEV utilizes a 552 pre - existing clathrin independent endocytic pathway or a specific pathway is induced in 553 response to virus binding and downstream signalling . The receptor for JEV on neuronal cells 554 is still uncharacterized . It is possible that binding to a specific receptor and entry through a 555 clathrin independent pathway confers the virus with a greater advantage to establish infection 556 in neuronal cells . Like all viruses , JEV relies on host cell factors and physiological processes 557 for key steps of its replication cycle . Identification of these processes and factors will not 558 only allow a better insight into pathogenic mechanism , but may identify novel targets for 559 future therapeutic development . 560 561 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 b y g ue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 25 Acknowledgements 562 This work was supported by Department of Biotechnology ( DBT ) , Government of 563 India grant - BT / MB / 01 / VIDRC / 08 to SV . 564 We would like to thank Dr .
