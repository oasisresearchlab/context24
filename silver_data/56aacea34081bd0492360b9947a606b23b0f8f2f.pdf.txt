Two seemingly unrelated experimental treat - ments inhibit receptor mediated endocytosis : ( a ) deple - tion of intracellular K ÷ ( Larkin , J . M . , M . S . Brown , J . L . Goldstein , and R . G . W . Anderson . 1983 . Cell . 33 : 273 - 285 ) ; and ( b ) treatment with hypertonic media ( Daukas , G . , and S . H . Zigmond . 1985 . J . Cell Biol . 101 : 1673 - 1679 ) . Since the former inhibits the forma - tion of clathrin - coated pits ( Larkin , J . M . , W . D . Don - zell , and R . G . W . Anderson . 1986 . J . Cell Biol . 103 : 2619 - 2627 ) , we were interested in determining whether hypertonic treatment has the same effect , and if so , why . Fibroblasts ( human or chicken ) were in - cubated in normal saline made hypertonic with 0 . 45 M sucrose , then broken open by sonication and freeze - etched to generate replicas of their inner membrane surfaces . Whereas untreated cells display typical geo - desic lattices of clathrin under each coated pit , hyper - tonic cells display in addition a number of empty clathrin " microcages ' . At first , these appear around the edges of normal coated pit lattices . With further time in hypertonic medium , however , normal lattices largely disappear and are replaced by accumulations of microcages . Concomitantly , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptors lose their normal clustered distribu - tion and become dispersed all over the cell surface , as seen by fluorescence microscopy and freeze - etch elec - tron microscopy of LDL attached to the cell surface . Upon return to normal medium at 37°C , these changes promptly reverse . Within 2 min , small clusters of LDL reappear on the surfaces of cells and normal clathrin lattices begin to reappear inside ; the size and number of these receptor / clathrin complexes returns to normal over the next 10 min . Thus , in spite of their seeming unrelatedness , both K ÷ depletion and hyper - tonic treatment cause coated pits to disappear , and both induce abnormal clathrin polymerization into empty microcages . This suggests that in both cases , an abnormal formation of microcages inhibits endocy - tosis by rendering clathrin unavailable for assembly into normal coated pits . C LATHRIN coated pits are the primary plasma mem - brane specialization involved in the uptake of a wide variety of molecules by receptor - mediated endocyto - sis ( 4 , 38 ) . Two broad functions have been attributed to these regions of membrane : ( a ) molecular determinants associated with the clathrin lattice may cause receptors to become clus - tered ; and ( b ) the clathrin lattice may in some way control the invagination of the membrane to form endocytic vesicles . To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these two aspects of coated pit function , one approach is to search for treatments that inhibit endocytosis and then to character - ize the effects of these treatments on coated pit structure and receptor clustering . Currently , three experimental treatments are known to in - hibit receptor - mediated endocytosis : ( a ) depletion of intra - cellular potassium ( 22 , 24 - 26 , 29 , 30 , 34 , 40 ) , ( b ) exposure of cells to hypertonic media ( 10 ) , and ( c ) acidification of the cytoplasm ( 11 , 16 , 21 , 41 ) . Whereas potassium depletion ap - pears to inhibit the assembly of coated pits , causing the cell to have a plasma membrane virtually devoid of endocytic sites ( 24 , 26 , 34 ) , acidification appears not to affect assembly but to arrest the pinching off of coated pits to form coated vesicles ( 11 , 41 ) . Whether or not hypertonic treatment exerts its effects by interfering with one or another of these aspects of coated pit function has not been determined . Daukas and Zigmond ( 10 ) first showed that exposure of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to media containing 0 . 43 M sucrose caused the rapid and reversible inhibition of recep - tor - mediated internalization of chemotactic peptides , sug - gesting that coated pit function was inhibited by hypertonic - ity . We further analyze the effects of hypertonic media on coated pit function and architecture in cultured fibroblasts , taking advantage of the opportunity to obtain distinct en face images of coated pits via the quick - freeze / deep - etch method of preparing cells for electron microscopy ( 15 , 17 ) . This shows that hypertonic treatment rapidly and reversibly in - hibits the internalization of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) t and causes the receptors for this ligand to become randomly 1 .

Coordinately , coated pits become reduced in size and number , and many small " microcages " of clathrin appear on the inner membrane sur - face . These unusual polymers , sharply curved and devoid of membrane , become so abundant that they apparently deplete the cytoplasm of clathrin needed for normal coated pit as - sembly . In this sense , hypertonicity and potassium depletion appear to inhibit endocytosis in the same way . It remains to be seen , however , whether both treatments stimulate clathrin microcage formation by the same mechanism . Materials and Methods Materials DME ( No . 320 - 185 ) and MEM ( No . 180 - 173 ) were purchased from Gibco Laboratories ( Grand Island , NY ) . A mixture of insulin , transferrin , and selenium ( ITS Premix ) was purchased from Collaborative Research , Inc . ( Lexington , MA ) . Human LDL ( d = 1 . 019 - 1 . 063 g / ml ) and lipoprotein - deficient serum ( d > 1 . 215 g / ml ) were prepared by ultracentrifugation of plasma ( 12 ) . Fluorescent LDL ( designated r [ PMCA Oleate ] LDL ) was pre - pared as previously described ( 6 ) . Poly - L - lysine ( cat . No . I ) - 2636 ) and horseradish peroxidase Type VI ( cat . No . H - 1784 ) were from Sigma Chemi - cal Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Anti - mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothio - cyanate was from Zymed ( cat . No . 61 - 6511 ) . All fixatives were from Ladd , Inc . ( Burlington , VT ) . Monoclonal anti - clathrin heavy chain ( " x22 " ) was a generous gift from Francis Brodsky ( 7 ) . Other supplies were obtained from sources as previously reported ( 24 ) . Cell Culture Cultured human fibroblasts were derived from a skin biopsy obtained from a normal subject . Cells were grown in monolayer and set up for experiments according to a standard format ( 12 ) . On day zero , 3 - 4 x 104 cells were seeded in each petri dish ( 60 x 15 mm ) that contained a 22 - ram 2 coverslip , then cultured in 3 ml of DME supplemented with 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 mg / ml of streptomycin , and 10 % ( vol / vol ) FCS . Fresh medium of the same composition was added on day three . On day five of cell growth , each monolayer received 2 ml DME supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin , 5 t ~ g / ml insulin , 5 / ~ g / rnl transferrin , 5 mg / ml selenium , and 10 % ( vol / vol ) human lipoprotein - dcficient serum . ~ , 11 experiments were performed on day seven after 48 h of incubation in this lipoprotein - deficient serum . Cultured chicken fibroblasts were removed from primary culture with trypsin / EDTA and replated at l05 cells / ml into 35 - ram petri dishes contain - ing several 3 x 3 - ram pieces of No . I glass coverslips that were cleaned in hot chromic acid , washed extensively with water , and sterilized with etha - nol before use . The cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 100 U / ml of peniciUin , and 100 mg / mi of streptomycin . After one day of culture at 37°C , at a time when the cells had spread and reached sub - confluence on the small glass squares , they were removed from the CO2 in - cubator and washed four times at 37°C in Ringer ' s solution ( prepared ac - cording to a standard formula [ 19 ] ) before further experimental manipulation . Preparation of Carbon - Platinum Replicas of the Inner Cell Surface Cells on coverslips were subjected to various experimental treatments detailed in Results and the figure legends . At the end of each treatment , each coverslip was exposed for 5 s to 0 . 3 mg / ml poly - L - lysine ( molecular mass " , , 47 kD ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) dissolved in the experimental solution . The cells were then washed l0 s in hypotonic medium , prepared by mixing one part experimental solution with two parts distilled water . The cells were then transferred to buffer A ( 70 mM KCI , 30 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM MgCl2 , 3 mM EOTA ) and immediately broken open by placing an ultrasonic microprobe ( Kontcs Co . , Vineland , NJ ) 4 mm away from the surface of the coverslip and delivering 15 % maximum power for i s . Sonicated ceils were immediately transferred to 2 % glutaraldehyde in buffer A for 30 rain at room temperature . After fixation , the coverslips were washed four times with dis - tilled water in preparation for freeze - drying ( 18 ) . Thereafter , each coverslip was placed on a slab of aldehyde - fixed rabbit lung and attached to the plunger of the " Cryopress " freezing machine ( Med - Vac , Inc . , St . Louis , MO ) . Excess water was blotted from the coverslip just before it was brought into contact with a copper block cooled with liquid helium , as previously described ( 13 , 20 ) . The frozen coverslip was then transferred to a freeze - etch unit ( No . 301 or 400 ; Balzers S . E A . , Milan ) and freeze - dried at - 80°C for 15 rain . A rotary replica of its exposed surface was prepared by evaporat - ing 2 - 3 nm of platinum - carbon onto it at an angle of 24 ° above the horizon - tal , followed by 10 nm of pure carbon rotary evaporamd at a 75 ° angle . The replica was then separated from the coverslip by immersion in full strength hydrofluoric acid , washed twice in distilled water , and cleaned by flotation on household bleach ( 5 % sodium hypochlorite ) for 5 - 10 min . Finally , it was washed several times in distilled water , broken into small pieces , and picked up on 400 - mesh Formvar - coated grids for electron microscopy . Fluorescence Microscopy To monitor receptor - mediated endocytosis of LDL , fibroblast monolayers grown on glass cover , slips for 7 d were subjected to the experimental pro - tocols indicated in the appropriate figure legends . At the end of each experi - ment , 20 pg / ml of r ( PCMA oleate ) LDL was added to each dish and cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min . Then the cells were fixed for 20 rain at room temperature in 3 % ( wt / vo [ ) paraformaldehyde in buffer B ( 10 mM Na phosphate , 150 mM NaCI , and 2 mM MgCI2 at pH 7 . 4 ) . To localize clathrin distribution by indirect immunofluorescence , fibro - blast monolayers grown on glass coverslips were subjected to experimental treatments described in the figure legends and then fixed with 2 % ( wt / vol ) paraformaldehyde in buffer B . The cells were then washed briefly with 2 ml of 50 mM NH4CI in buffer B and twice more with buffer B . Each monolayer was then permeabilized with 2 ml of 0 . 01 % ( vol / vol ) Triton X - 100 in buffer B for 5 min at 10°C . Each coverslip was then placed in a petri dish ( cell side up ) , covered with 60 / ~ l of mouse anti - clathrin IgG ( 1 / ~ g / ml of monoclonal anti - heavy chain antibody [ ×22 ; reference 7 ] ) and incubated for 60 rain at 37°C . After four washes ( 15 rain each ) with buffer B , the cells were incubated with 60 # l of goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate ( 50 / ~ g / ml ) for 60 min at 37°C . The coverslips were finally washed and mounted on glass slides with DABCO media or with 0 . 1 M N - propyl gallatc ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) in 70 % glycerol / 30 % buffer B . All fluorescence samples were viewed with UV epi - illumination using the ap - propriate filter packages ( 5 , 6 ) . Figure I . ( a ) Control distribution of fluorescent LDL in human fibroblasts . Cells were grown in media that induce LDL receptors , then incubated in 50 # g / ml r ( PMCA Oleate ) LDL for 30 rain at 37°C ; this demonstrates normal LDL uptake into large endosomes via receptor - mediated endocytosis . ( b ) Fluorescent LDL in hyper - tonically treated fibroblasts . Cells were pretreated with HBSS con - taining 0 . 45 M sucrose for 15 min at 37°C , To this hypertonic medium , r ( PMCA Oleate ) LDL was added at 50 # g / ml and the cells were incubated for a further 30 min at 37°C before fixation . This demonstrates that hypcrtonicity stops LDL endocytosis and yields a diffuse distribution of LDL on the cell surface . Bar , 10 # m . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 108 , 1989 390 Internalization of Horseradish Peroxidase Horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) uptake was analyzed as previously described ( 19 ) . Cultured chick fibroblasts grown on full - sized , 22 - ram 2 coverslips were subjected to the indicated treatment and then fixed with 2 % formalde - hyde and 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde in Ringer ' s solution for 1 h . The cells were then processed for visualization of peroxidase with diaminobenzidine and H202 as previously described ( 19 ) . Surface Distribution of LDL Binding Sites To monitor the distribution of LDL receptors , replicas were prepared of freeze - dried human fibroblasts that had been incubated for various times with native LDL . Human fibroblasts grown in culture for 7 d as above were either chilled to 4°C in Hank ' s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) or prein - cubated for 45 min at 37°C in HBSS containing 0 . 43 M sucrose before chill - ing to 4°C . Both sets of cells were then incubated at 4°C for 1 h in HBSS containing 20 / ~ g / ml of LDL . Cells were then washed with I - 1BSS containing 1 % BSA according to standard procedures ( 12 ) and either fixed immediately or wanned up to 370C for the indicated periods of time before fixation . In all cases , cells were fixed with 2 % glutaraldebyde in HBSS for 30 rain at room temperature , washed in HBSS , and shipped to St . Louis by Federal Express . The next day , samples were subjected to quick - freezing , freeze - drying , and rotary replication with platinum at 24°C as described above . Electron Microscopy All electron micrographs were prepared using a JEOL 200CX electron mi - croscope operating at 100 KV . Stereo viewing and digitization and quanti - fication of the micrographs were carded out as previously described ( 13 , 17 ) . Results Hypertonic Media Inhibit Receptor - mediated Endocytosis of LDL and Bulk Uptake of HRP To determine if hypertonic media would inhibit endocytosis of LDL , endocytosis was monitored using fluorescent LDL ( 6 ) . Normal human fibroblasts exposed to fluorescent LDL for 30 min at 37°C internalized the ligand into numerous vacuoles located in the perinuclear area ( Fig . 1 a ) . In con - trast , cells pretreated with hypertonic medium for 15 min at 37°C and then incubated with fluorescent LDL in the same medium for 30 min at 37°C , displayed few or no fluorescent vacuoles inside ( Fig . 1 b ) ; instead , fluorescence appeared to be diffusely distributed on their surfaces . Likewise , HRP up - take into chick fibroblasts was inhibited by hypertonicity . Af - ter 20 min of incubation in 10 mg / ml HRP , the tracer was found in numerous vesicles within the cytoplasm of untreated ceils ( Fig . 2 a ) . In contrast , HRP accumulation was virtually absent in cells pretreated with hypertonic media for 10 min and then maintained in hypertonic media during a 30 - min ex - posure to the tracer ( Fig . 2 b ) . These data indicate that in fibroblasts , hypertonicity inhibits both receptor - mediated and bulk - phase endocytosis ( cf . reference 29 ) . This is in con - trast to leukocytes , where bulk phase uptake is apparently relatively unaffected ( 10 ) . Effects of Hypertonic Treatment on Coated Pits Human and chick fibroblasts processed for indirect immuno - fluorescence localization of clathrin normally displayed a characteristic punctate distribution of staining on their top and bottom membrane surfaces , as well as internal perinu - Figure 2 .

Cells were formaldehyde fixed , permeabilized , and processed for localization of clathrin heavy chain with a mono - clonal IgG ( 7 ) . In control cells ( a ) , anti - clathrin staining occurs at discrete spots on the top and bottom surface and as an internal perinuclear halo that presumably represents the Golgi apparatus . In cells treated with 0 . 45 M sucrose for 30 min at 37°C ( b ) , sub - surface staining of clathrin appears to be more irregular and less distinctly punctate than normal , while perinuclear staining is in - creased .

In normal ceils , various stages of clathrin lattice assembly and curvature are seen . In hypertonic cells , membrane - attached lattices are reduced to flat remnants ( such as the one at the asterisk ) and are replaced by numerous clathrin microcages ( one of which is indicated by the arrow ) .

In contrast , hyper - tonically treated cells displayed fewer and more irregular punctae of clathrin immunoreactivity at the cell surface ( Fig . 3 b ) . To some extent , this reduction in staining may have been only apparent , since hypertonically treated cells also displayed increased diffuse fluorescence , particularly around their nuclei . Higher resolution views of these changes in clathrin distri - bution were obtained from platinum replicas of the inner sur - faces of freeze - dried chick fibroblast membranes . Untreated cells had numerous clathrin lattices distributed on the inner membrane surface ( Fig . 4 a ) . Normally , these displayed a range of shapes , from almost flat to almost completely spher - ical ( Table I ) . Normal lattice diameter was 0 . 15 - 0 . 2 # m , hence each lattice was composed of several dozen clathrin polygons ( cf . references 15 and 17 ) . In contrast , when cells were incubated in hypertonic media for 30 min , the number of coated pits as well as their size was dramatically reduced ( Fig . 4 b and Table I ) . The remaining lattices averaged 0 . 08 # m in diameter , had a relatively planar configuration , and typically consisted of only 5 - 10 polygons . Also evident on the membranes of hypertonically treated chick fibroblasts were many extremely small ( 50 - - 70 - nm - diam ) and extremely round geodesic lattices ( Fig . 4 b ) . These unusual polymers we presume to be clathrin and hence - forth will term " microcages " . They were most abundant at the margins of the remaining flat lattices ( arrows in Fig . 5 ) , but also occurred elsewhere on the membrane , though in no par - ticular association with actin filaments or other plasma membrane features . These microcages looked exactly like the small lattices that form when purified clathrin triskelions are polymerized via exposure to low pH ( 9 , 23 ) . Also , they looked just like the smallest of the cages typically found in purified preparations of brain coated vesicles ( 8 , 37 ) . These Figure 5 . Two stereo views ofmi - crocages in association with re - sidual clathrin lattices from chick fibroblasts treated with hyper - tonic sucrose for 30 rain at 37°C .

Previous investigators have found that the smaller cages in brain coated vesicle preparations are devoid of internal mem - branes , as judged by negative staining ( 8 ) , deep - etch electron microscopy ( 17 ) , and whole - mount cryo - electron micros - copy ( 45 , 46 ) . Likewise , the microcages seen in hypertoni ? cally treated cells also appear to lack internal membranes . That is , when hypertonicaUy treated cells were subjected to freeze - fracture analysis , we saw no evidence of small plasma The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 108 , 1989 394 Figure 7 . Human fibroblasts depleted of potassium for 1 h at 37°C by the hypotonic shock , K - free incubation procedure ( 24 , 26 ) . The result is essentially identical to that of hypertonic treatment ( Fig . 4 b ) : numerous clathrin microcages are found amongst residual flat clathrin lattices . ( Why the flat lattices are not entirely gone , as reported in reference 26 , is not clear . ) At the asterisks are some examples of the broad reticulum of branched , anastomotic membrane tubules that characteristically adheres to the plasma membrane of human fibroblasts ( as opposed to chick fibroblasts ) .

Microcages Also Appear in K÷ - depleted Cells Previous studies by Larkin et al . ( 26 ) showed that small , round , vaguely polygonal structures also appear on the membrane of human fibroblasts after potassium depletion . However , this study used replicas of critical point dried membranes , which did not provide sufficient resolution to unanbiguously identify these new structures . We repeated these experiments and found that freeze dried membranes of K + - depleted human fibroblasts looked essentially identical to the membranes of hypertonically treated cells ( Fig . 7 ) . In addition to displaying a residuum of reduced and flattened clathrin lattices , they also displayed large numbers of un - usually small clathrin cages scattered across the inner mem - brane surface . Since freeze - fracture analysis again did not re - Effects of Hypertonicity on the Distribution of LDL Receptors Previous studies have shown that receptor - bound LDL on the surfaces of fibroblasts is readily visualized in freeze - etch replicas ( 15 ) . Therefore , we have used the native ligand to study the distribution of LDL receptors under various condi - tions . When untreated human fibroblasts were chilled to 4°C and incubated with LDL , their surfaces displayed numerous clusters of LDL particles ( Fig . 8 ) . Usually these clusters were locaW . d in relatively fiat indentations , although LDL clusters within deeper invaginations were also found ( Fig . 8 b ) . Curiously , the LDL particles in these clusters often ap - peared to be aggregated or aligned into beads - on - a - string patterns . By contrast , in hypertonically treated cells the LDL Heuscr and Anderson Hypertonicity on Clathrin Lattices 395 Figure 8 . Stereo views of LDL clusters on control human fibro - blasts , arranged to suggest the progress of invagination from a to b . Bar , 0 . 1 # m . particles were dispersed on the cell surface ; therefore , the receptors were not clustered in the absence of coated pits . Many of the LDL particles appeared to be present in groups of two particles ( circled in Fig . 9 a ) . By quantitative analysis , the density of particles was ~ 55 / # m 2 and 50 - 70 % of the particles were dimeric . A distinct reclustering of LDL receptors after the return to isosmotic buffer could also be followed in freeze dried cells . Thus , when hypertonically treated cells were incubated with LDL at 4°C and then shifted to 37°C in isosmotic buffer , clusters of particles reappeared within 2 min ( Fig . 9 b ) . These clusters initially contained fewer LDL particles than clusters found in control cells ( compare Fig . 9 b with Fig . 8 ) . Moreover , at these early times of recovery , many LDL dimers remained dispersed on the cell surface . With longer times at 37°C , progressively more LDL particles appeared in the clusters ( Fig . 9 c ) ; by 10 min at 37°C , the clusters were often found to be deeply invaginated ( Fig . 9 d ) . This time sequence of LDL particle clustering upon return to isotonic medium paralleled the recovery of coated pit lattices , as visualized on replicas of the inner cell surface ( Table I ) . Discussion Potassium depletion and hypertonic treatment both inhibit receptor - mediated endocytosis ( 10 , 24 ) . Here , we show that both also cause a drastic reduction in normal coated pits and produce numerous " microcages " beneath the plasma mem - brane ; e . g . , both create the same changes in the distribution of clathrin . These changes are analyzed in more detail below . The Formation of Microcages Why two treatments as seemingly disparate as K ÷ depletion and hypertonicity should lead to the same " salting out " of clathrin into microcages is not immediately obvious . How - ever , in the accompanying paper ( 16 ) , we show that ex - perimental acidification of the cytoplasm causes an even more prompt formation of microcages . Moreover , we have found that hypertonicity creates some degree of cytoplasmic acidification ( 16 ) and others have found that potassium deple - tion also does so ( 29 , 42 ) . Still , it is not clear that the degree of acidification achieved by either treatment is sufficient to reach the threshold for microcage formation ( pH 6 . 5 ; cf . reference 16 and Heuser , J . E . , P . H . Schlesinger , and A . Roos , manuscript in preparation ) . Nor have we been able to consistently prevent microcage formation by blocking the acidification that normally accompanies cell shrinkage ( per - sonal observations ) . Thus , other factors besides lowered pH may also cause cytoplasmic clathrin to form microcages ; ob - vious possibilities include the increases in protein and diva - lent - cation concentrations that accompany hypertonicity . We know of only two previous reports on the in vivo ac - cumulation of structures matching the description of micro - cages : one was in pancreatic acinar cells deprived of oxygen ( 33 , 36 ) and the other in mosquito oocytes deprived of their normal supply of blood lipoprotein ( 39 ) . Whether these con - ditions also involve some degree of cytoplasmic acidification remains to be seen , but seems quite likely . Furthermore , brain coated vesicle preparations such as those in Fig . 6 c contain a high proportion of microcages , and correspond - ingly , nerve cells are well - known to acidify postmortally . In any case , our current feeling is that microcage formation will The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 108 , 1989 396 Figure 9 .

Heuser and Anderson Hypertonicity on Clathrin Lattices 397 turn out to be a good indication of cytoplasmic acidification , and probably occurs via mechanisms similar to in vitro poly - merization of clathrin by dialysis into acidic solutions ( 23 , 38 , 44 , 47 ) . This is discussed in more detail in the accom - panying paper ( 16 ) . The Loss of Coated Pit Lattices Even prolonged treatment with hypertonic media did not cause all of the coated pits to disappear from the cell surface ( Table I ) . This differs from previous reports on the effects of potassium depletion ( 24 , 26 , 34 ) ; though in the current ex - periments , potassium depletion did not cause coated pits to disappear entirely either ( Fig . 7 ) . Nevertheless , we found that after either treatment the remaining coated pits were structurally abnormal in several respects . First , they were much smaller than normal , often consisting of only 5 - 10 hexagons . Second , they were much flatter than normal and often displayed no sign of curvature at all . Since these lattices remained present throughout hypertonic treatment ( up to 60 min ) , they clearly were not able to support further endocyto - sis ; but whether they were " residua " of arrested endocytosis or were involved in some entirely different function remains to be seen . For instance , since our analysis focused on por - tions of the plasma membrane that remained attached to the glass substratum , it was biased toward observing clathrin - undercoated attachment plaques ( cf . references 1 - 3 , 32 , 35 ) . If these in fact exist , they might be spots where clathrin could have an unusually high affinity for the plasma membrane , hence they might not depolymerize even in the face of severe loss of the clathrin involved in endocytosis . In any case , the present study agrees with previous reports in showing that big curved clathrin lattices , of the sort that look like they are involved in pinching off from the plasma membrane , essen - tially disappear during hypertonic treatment as well as dur - ing potassium depletion . How Microcage Formation Could Lead to Loss of Coated Pits Failure of clathrin lattices to form properly in hypertonic or potassium - depleted ceils could represent either a loss of the normal supply of necessary substrates for lattice formation or a disruption of the normal signals for polymerization . We favor the former possibility for two reasons . First , on simple intuitive grounds , the abrupt appearance of microcages in hypertonic cells would suggest that signals for clathrin poly - merization are in fact enhanced , not diminished . Normal cells maintain a pool of cytoplasmic clathrin that behaves as if it is soluble ( 14 , 28 ) ; there is no indication that the pool is normally in the form of small microcages . Indeed , there is immunological evidence that this pool is not polymerized ( 7 , 14 , 28 , 34 ) . Thus , the appearance of microcages in hyper - tonic cells appears to represent a shift toward polymeriza - tion , which might also have been manifest as an enhance - ment of coated pit formation , not a reduction . Second , on more quantitative grounds , the magnitude of microcage formation appears to be sufficiently great to con - sume the normal cytoplasmic pool ; this would of course in - terrupt further clathrin lattice formation and thereby halt receptor - mediated endocytosis . The quantitative basis for concluding that microcage formation consumes the cytoplas - mic pool of clathrin is as follows : ( a ) The normal size of the pool of unpolymerized clathrin in typical cultured cells ( e . g . , the portion that is Triton X - 100 - extractable ) is " o50 % of the total ( , o2 × 105 molecules ) ( 14 , 28 ) . ( b ) The normal size of the polymerized pool , based on the numbers of coated pits seen in normal cells ( but neglecting the contribution of Golgi - associated coated vesicles ) also approaches 2 x l0 s molecules . This has been measured ( 14 ) , but also can be de - rived as follows : coated pits represent 1 - 2 % of the cell sur - face ( 4 - 6 ) , so a typical fibroblast with a surface area of 2 , 500 / ~ m 2 will have " ol , 000 - 2 , 000 coated pits present at any one time . Its coated pits measure 0 . 18 - 0 . 24 / ~ m in diameter ( and correspondingly , the final coated vesicles in fibroblasts mea - sure 0 . 9 - 0 . 12 / ~ m in diameter ) a size range that would require 80 - 140 clathrin triskelia per coat ( cf . references 15 , 17 ) . The total number of triskelia thus tied up in all the coated struc - tures on any one fibroblast is 0 . 8 - 2 . 8 x 1 @ molecules ( 80 x 1 , 000 to 140 x 2 , 000 ) . ( c ) After hypertonic treatment , the total number of coated pits per cell diminishes by " o50 % ( Ta - ble I ) , while their average size diminishes to " o0 . 14 # m in diameter , equivalent to no more than " o50 triskelia per resid - ual coat . This represents a drop to " o0 . 5 - 0 . 75 x 10 S tri - skelia in lattices on the surfaces of hypertonic cells , equiva - lent to a release of " ol . 0 - 1 . 5 x 1 @ triskelia per cell . ( d ) The abundance of microcages in hypertonic cells , based solely on counts of the ones that stick to the plasma mem - brane during sonication and freeze - etching , is " o5 , 000 - 7 , 500 per cell ( ' o2 - 3 microcages / / zm 2 of cell surface ; cf . Fig . 4 b ) . Since each microcage measures 50 - 60 nm , each must contain between 28 and 36 triskelia ( 8 , 17 , 38 ) . This means that microcages tie up 1 . 4 - 2 . 7 x 1 @ triskelia per cell ( e . g . , 20 x 5 , 000 to 36 x 7 , 500 ) , more than enough to account for all the triskelia that are freed by lack of involvement in coated pits ( c above ) . ( Another way to appreciate this is to remem - ber that each normal coated pit involves " o120 triskelia while each microcage " o30 triskelia , so if one simply derived from the other , " o4 microcages should appear for every coated pit that disappears . In fact , coated pits do not completely disap - pear in hypertonic cells , yet microcages become more than four times as abundant as the original population of coated pits ( 2 - 3 microcages / # m 2 in hypertonic cells vs . 1 coated pit / 2 / zm 2 in normal cells ) . ( e ) The total number of micro - cages in hypertonic ceils is probably much greater than the number found on the plasma membrane after sonication ; im - munofluorescence data such as Fig . 3 strongly suggests this . Hence , microcages would seem to make major inroads into the soluble pool of clathrin , as well as consuming the tri - skelia normally involved in coated pits . There are a number of uncertainties in the above lines of reasoning , largely resulting from the degree of variability in these parameters seen from cell to cell . Not until individual ceils can be analyzed both before and after hypertonic treat - ment will the actual extent of clathrin lattice conversion be obvious . Nevertheless , our current impression is that micro - cages become sufficiently abundant to account for all loss of clathrin from normal lattices as well as to deplete the normal cytoplasmic pool . Hypertonicity ( and by analogy , potassium depletion ) would thus appear to arrest normal coated pit for - marion by creating an abnormally great amount of clathrin polymerization in the wrong place . The normal control of clathrin polymerization at receptor - rich sites on the plas - ma membrane is apparently overridden , and thus receptor - mediated endocytosis stops . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 108 , 1989 398 Dynamics of Receptor Clustering Previously , Larkin et al . ( 24 , 26 ) showed by thin sectioning that potassium depletion led to complete dispersion of LDL - ferritin on the surface of human fibroblasts . Hyper - tonic treatment produced the same receptor dispersion , as indicated by the distribution of LDL particles on the surface of the cells studied here . In the dispersed state , the LDL par - ticles were predominantly arranged into groups of two parti - cles . Since LDL particles adsorbed to mica were monomeric ( data not shown ) , most likely the dimeric LDL reflects the presence of receptors that are self associated into groups of two on the cell surface . Van Driel et ai . ( 43 ) used bivalent cross - linkers to show that a significant proportion of the LDL receptors on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells transfected with a cDNA for the normal human receptor exist as dimers . Similarly , the receptor for N - acelylglucos - amine - terminated glycoproteins in chickens appears to exist as multimers on the cell surface ( 27 ) . Whereas it is difficult to quantify the number of receptors that are self associated using cross - linking techniques ( 43 ) , our results indicates that in human fibroblasts > 50 % are dimeric . The first sign of receptor reclustering upon return to iso - tonic media turns out to be the appearance of broad depres - sions containing relatively few LDL particles ( Fig . 9 b ) . LDL particles reach their maximum concentration in these depressions only several minutes later ( Fig . 9 c ) . This tem - poral sequence suggests that as soon as nascent coated pits form , they gain an ability to sequester LDL receptors , but receptors move relatively slowly into the " sticky " loci they create in the plasma membrane . More definitive conforma - tion that this is the natural sequence of coated vesicle for - marion will await the development of a technique that will permit simultaneous visualization of receptor clusters and clathrin lattices on opposite sides of the membrane . With such a technique , the methods of blocking endocytosis de - scribed here should prove useful in dissecting apart the nat - ural sequence of clathrin lattice formation and receptor clus - tering .
