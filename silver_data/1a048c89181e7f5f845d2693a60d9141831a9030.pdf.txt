AM3 is known to interact directly with membrane sterols and permeabilize mem - branes by forming pores . Because AM3 binds to sterols such as cholesterol and ergosterol , it can be assumed that AM3 has some impact on lipid rafts , which are membrane domains rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol . Hence , we first examined the effect of AM3 on phase - separated liposomes , in which raft - like ordered and non - raft - like disordered domains are segregated . Consequently , AM3 disrupted the phase separation at 22 μ M , as in the case of methyl - β - cyclodextrin , a well - known raft - disrupter that extracts sterol from membranes . The surface plasmon resonance measurements and dye leakage assays show that AM3 preferentially recognizes cholesterol in the disordered membrane , which may reflect a weaker lipid - cholesterol interaction in disordered membrane than in ordered membrane . Finally , to gain insight into the AM3 - induced coalescence of membrane phases , we measured membrane fluidity using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy , demonstrating that AM3 significantly increases the order of disordered phase . Together , AM3 preferentially binds to the disordered phase rather than the or - dered phase , and enhances the order of the disordered phase , consequently blending the separated phases . 1 . Introduction Dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Amphidinium are a rich source of polyketide metabolites with unique and fascinating structures and bioactivities . In 1991 , amphidinol 1 , the very first member of the polyhydroxy - polyene metabolite family , was isolated from Amphidinium klebsii [ 1 ] . Since then , more than 20 closely related homologs , collec - tively termed amphidinols , have been reported [ 2 – 12 ] . In addition , numerous amphidinol analogs such as luteophanols [ 13 ] and karlotox - ins [ 14 ] were isolated both from Amphidinium and other dinoflagellate species . These natural compounds possess polyhydroxy and polyene chains , which are separated by two tetrahydropyran rings . This struc - tural feature confers them amphiphilic nature . The middle region of the molecule containing the tetrahydropyran rings is conserved among the amphidinols , while the structural variation mainly occurs on both the polyhydroxy and polyene chains [ 8 , 9 , 13 ] . Amphidinols exhibit antifungal and hemolytic actions , which arise from their interaction with lipid bilayers , ultimately enhancing mem - brane permeability [ 3 , 4 ] . Amphidinol 3 ( AM3 , Fig . 1 ) [ 4 , 5 , 15 ] has the most potent antifungal and hemolytic activities among amphidinols . It was reported that AM3 exhibits potent pore - forming activity on lipo - somes [ 4 , 15 ] , which absolutely depends on the presence of membrane sterol ; i . e . , its absence renders AM3 inactive [ 15 , 16 ] . Our previous study using surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) and solid - state 2 H NMR demonstrated that AM3 directly interacts with sterols in membranes [ 17 ] . In addition , more recent channel recording experiments further suggest that AM3 forms both barrel - stave and toroidal pores depending on the AM3 concentration ; a higher concentration of AM3 forms jumbo toroidal pores , while a lower concentration of AM3 forms a barrel - stave channel that shows a single channel property [ 18 ] . On the other hand , there are many sterol - binding bioactive natural products , such as polyenemacrolide antibiotics and saponins . Some of them are suggested to elicit their biological activities in association with lipid rafts , which are membrane micro - domains consisting of sphingo - lipids , sterols , and / or proteins [ 22 ] . For example , saponins are assumed to interact with cholesterol - enriched lipid rafts , either disrupting them or causing their miscibility [ 23 ] . Similarly , filipin III , a representative polyene macrolide , interacts with membrane sterol , causing disruption of lipid rafts or enhancement of membrane permeability [ 24 , 25 ] . Because it is believed that lipid rafts modulate the activity and location * Corresponding author . E - mail address : matsmori @ chem . kyushu - univ . jp ( N . Matsumori ) .

Hence as the first step of this study , we examined the effect of AM3 , a strong sterol - binder , on lipid membranes that have a mixture of liquid - ordered ( Lo ) and liquid - disordered ( Ld ) phases as a model for lipid rafts in cellular membranes . Subsequent experiments reveal that AM3 disrupts the membrane phase separation by preferentially binding to the disordered phase . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Materials Porcine brain sphingomyelin ( SM ) and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) . Cholesterol ( Chol ) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . Texas Red - DPPE ( TXred - DPPE ) was purchased from Invitrogen ( Eugene , OR ) . Fluorescent - labeled lipids , 488neg - SM , 488neg - DOPC , 594neg - SM , and 594neg - DOPC , were synthesized following our previous report [ 28 ] . 2 . 2 . Isolation of AM3 The culture of the dinoflagellate Amphidinium klebsii and the isolation of AM3 were performed as reported previously [ 15 ] . 2 . 3 . Giant unilamellar vesicle ( GUV ) preparation and fluorescence microscopy observation GUVs were obtained by electroformation as described by Angelova and Dimitrov [ 29 ] . In brief , SM , DOPC , and Chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 in molar ratio ) were dissolved in CHCl 3 – MeOH ( 4 : 1v / v ) to a final phospholipid con - centration of 1 mg mL (cid:0) 1 , to which TXred - DPPE and 488neg - SM ( 0 . 2 mol % of total lipids ) were added . Aliquots ( 10 μ L ) were subsequently deposited on parallel aligned electrodes ( Pt wires , 100 μ m in diameter ) attached to a glass slide ( 24 mm × 60 mm , 0 . 12 – 0 . 17 mm thickness ) , after which the solvent was evaporated under vacuum for more than 12 h . Milli - Q water ( 400 μ L , Simplicity UV ) was then added to completely immerse the electrodes , which were then sealed with another glass slide using a rubber spacer with a small fill port for AM3 injection . This chamber was maintained at 70 ◦ C on a temperature - controlled aluminum block ( Sahara 310 , Rocker Scientific Co . , Ltd . , Taipei , Taiwan ) , and an alternating current ( 10 V , 10 Hz ) was applied ( 20 MHz function / arbitrary waveform function generator , Agilent , Santa Clara CA ) for 60 min to form GUVs . The GUVs were then cooled to 25 ◦ C . Fluorescence microscopy observation was carried out using the BZ - X700 ( Keyence , Osaka , Japan ) with an air objective lens ( Plan Apo λ , 60 × , N . A . 0 . 95 , Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . The excitation ( 470 nm ) and detection ( 525 nm ) wavelengths were selected by dichroic mirrors , OP - 87763 ( Keyence , Osaka , Japan ) . After the GUVs without AM3 were observed , AM3 aqueous solution was added to the GUVs at the final concentrations of 11 , 22 , and 44 μ M , and the observation was continued for 50 min . 2 . 4 . SPR analysis SPR measurements were performed at 25 ◦ C using Biacore T100 system ( GE Healthcare , Chicago , IL , USA ) . LUVs ( DOPC , DOPC / Chol 9 : 1 and 7 : 3 , SM , SM / Chol 9 : 1 and 7 : 3 ) were prepared using HBS - N buffer [ 10 mM HEPES buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl ] and immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip surface , as previously described [ 17 ] . To compensate the difference in the immobilization amount of liposomes , the immo - bilization was normalized to 12000 RU . AM3 solutions in HBS - N buffer ( 30 , 40 , and 50 μ M ) were then injected at a flow rate of 10 μ L min (cid:0) 1 , and the association of AM3 was monitored for 300 s . Then HBS - N running buffer was injected at the same flow rate , and the dissociation of AM3 from the surface was monitored for 300 s . The sensor chip surface was regenerated after each analysis using our previously described protocol [ 17 ] . 2 . 5 . Calcein leakage experiments The extent of calcein leakage from liposomes was assessed as re - ported previously [ 15 ] . Large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) were prepared as follows : DOPC ( 10 mg ) or SM ( 10 mg ) , with or without sterol ( 10 or 30 mol % ) , was dissolved in CHCl 3 in a round - bottom flask . The solvent was removed by nitrogen gas flow and further dried in vacuo for 12 h . The lipid film obtained was rehydrated with 1 mL of 60 mM calcein in HBS - N [ 10 mM HEPES buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl ] and subjected to two cycles of vortexing ( 1 min ) and warming ( 65 ◦ C ) followed by five cycles of freezing ( (cid:0) 20 ◦ C ) and thawing ( 65 ◦ C ) to obtain multilamellar vesicles ( MLVs ) . Then , the suspension was passed through a poly - carbonate membrane filter ( pore size , 200 nm ) 19 times using a Mini - Extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc . ) to prepare LUVs of homoge - nous size . Excess calcein was removed by passing the suspension through a Sephadex G - 75 column ( Sigma - Aldrich ) with HBS - N buffer . The lipid concentration in the LUV fraction was quantified using phos - pholipid C - Test Wako ( Wako Pure Chemical Industries , Ltd . , Osaka , Japan ) . Resulting stock solution was stored at 4 ◦ C under nitrogen gas . Measurement of calcein leakage was performed on a JASCO FP 8300 spectrofluorometer ( JASCO Corp . , Tokyo , Japan ) with an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 517 nm . To monitor calcein leakage , the LUV suspension was diluted to 980 μ L with the HBS - N buffer , and a 20 - μ L aliquot of AM3 in HBS - N buffer was then added to give the final AM3 concentration of 0 , 1 , 5 , or 10 μ M . Subse - quently , 20 μ L of 10 % Triton X - 100 ( v / v ) ( Nacalai Tesque , Kyoto , Japan ) was added to obtain the condition of 100 % leakage . All measurements were performed at room temperature with a final lipid concentration of 27 μ M . 2 . 6 . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) The GUVs for FCS measurements were prepared in the manner as described above . For the observation of Fig . 5 , DOPC / Chol ( 9 : 1 ) and SM / Chol ( 9 : 1 ) GUVs containing 0 . 002 mol % 594neg - DOPC and 594neg - SM , respectively , were prepared . The GUVs used for Fig . 6 observation were composed of SM / DOPC / Chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) and contained 0 . 002 mol % 594neg - SM ( for the Lo phase observation ) and 594neg - DOPC ( for the Ld phase observation ) . FCS measurements started 15 min after AM3 dis - solved in HBS - N buffer was extraneously added to the GUVs . The mea - surements were performed at 25 ◦ C with a confocal microscope ( FV1000D , IX81 ; Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) , using an oil - immersion apochromat objective lens ( Olympus PLAPON60XO , 60 × , NA 1 . 4 ) . Diffusion coefficients were obtained following the protocol published previously [ 30 , 31 ] . The diffusion coefficient , D , was obtained by fitting the autocorrelation function of the time - dependent changes of the signal intensities of fluorescent probe molecules in diffraction - limited spots , G ( τ ) , with the following equation for two - dimensional simple Brownian diffusion : Fig . 1 . Chemical structure of AM3 . The stereochemistry was unambiguously elucidated by Oishi ’ s synthetic studies [ 19 – 21 ] . M . Hieda et al .

D is the diffusion coefficient , and τ is the delay time . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Effect of AM3 on phase - separated membranes To examine the effect of AM3 on Lo - Ld phase - separated membranes which mimic lipid rafts , we prepared giant unilamelar vesicles ( GUVs ) composed of SM , DOPC , and Chol ( Fig . 2 ) . In GUVs , the Lo and Ld phases are visualized with recently - developed 488neg - SM ( green fluorescence ) [ 28 ] and commercial TexRed - DPPE ( red fluorescence ) , respectively . The addition of 11 μ M of AM3 ( Chol : AM3 molar ratio is 1 : 1 ) did not coalesce the separated phases , although some constriction was observed around phase boundary . Meanwhile , at 22 and 44 μ M of AM3 , the separated phases became miscible after 45 min . The deformation of GUVs at 35 min in the presence of 22 and 44 μ M AM3 is probably the result of the increase of the outer leaflet surface area by AM3 binding . Although methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) , which extracts Chol from membrane and disrupts ordered domains , also mixed the separate phases at 4 mM , the efficiency is much lower than AM3 . This experiment clearly demon - strates that AM3 more effectively makes the separate phases miscible than M β CD . 3 . 2 . Interaction of AM3 towards ordered and disordered membranes To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the AM3 - induced disruption of phase separation , we performed surface plasmon reso - nance ( SPR ) experiments using liposomes that mimic ordered and disordered phases . A dodecylamine - modified CM5 sensor chip was prepared to immobilize the liposomes on the sensorchip as we previ - ously reported [ 16 , 32 ] . The sensorgrams ( Fig . 3 ) show that Chol significantly enhances the binding of AM3 on the membranes , which is consistent with our previous reports [ 16 , 17 ] . Taking account of the fact that AM3 directly binds to Chol in lipid bilayers [ 17 ] , the data clearly show that AM3 recognizes Chol existing in DOPC membrane better than the one in SM membrane . To evaluate the SPR data more quantitatively , we extracted kinetic parameters from the sensorgrams using the two - state reaction model , which was proved to be suitable for analysis of the binding of AM3 on membranes [ 16 ] . In this model , AM3 binding is assumed to be composed of two sequential steps ; the first step is binding of AM3 to the membrane surface , and the second step corresponds to the penetration of AM3 to the membrane interior to form more stable complexes probably with sterol . In Table 1 , k a1 and k d1 are association and dissociation rate constants of the first step , while k a2 and k d2 are association and disso - ciation rate constants for the second step . Accordingly , K D1 , K D2 , and K D represent the dissociation constants for the first step , the second step , and overall equilibriums , respectively . Notably , the overall dissociation constant K D for DOPC / Chol is remarkably smaller than that for SM / Chol , in line with the above conclusion that AM3 recognizes Chol in DOPC membrane better than the one in SM membrane . The kinetic data further demonstrate that although Chol promotes both the first and second steps of AM3 binding in both the DOPC and SM membranes , the Chol ’ s effect is more prominent in the DOPC membrane than in SM membrane , which will be discussed later . 3 . 3 . Pore formation of AM3 in ordered and disordered membranes To examine the channel formation of AM3 in ordered and disordered membranes , we next performed calcein leakage assays using SM or DOPC membranes in the presence and absence of Chol ( Fig . 4 ) . Although AM3 expectedly displays significant pore forming activity in the pres - ence of Chol , the activity is more prominent in DOPC / Chol system than in SM / Chol system . Because AM3 strictly requires Chol to form pores [ 4 , 15 – 17 ] , this data show that AM3 preferentially bind to Chol existing in a less ordered DOPC membrane , which is in agreement with the afore - mentioned SPR experiments . 3 . 4 . Membrane ordering effect of AM3 on ordered and disordered membranes Finally , to investigate the ordering effect of AM3 on ordered and disordered membranes , we measured diffusion coefficients of lipids using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) experiments . First , we prepared SM / Chol and DOPC / Chol membranes , which mimic the Fig . 2 . Fluorescence microscopy observation of phase - separated GUVs in the presence of AM3 and M β CD . GUVs were composed of SM / DOPC / Chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) . The disordered and ordered phases were labeled with 0 . 2 mol % TexRed - DPPE ( Ld marker , red ) and 488neg - SM ( Lo marker , green ) , respectively . The green fluorescence of 488neg - SM was hardly observed after the two phases became miscible at 22 and 44 μ M AM3 or 4 mM M β CD , because the green fluorescence was quenched by the FRET with TexRed - DPPE .

Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports 26 ( 2021 ) 100941 4 ordered and disordered phases , and labeled those membranes with 0 . 002 mol % 594neg - SM and 594neg - DOPC , respectively . These fluo - rescent lipids , which we recently developed , were shown to reproduce the diffusion properties of native lipids [ 28 ] . As a result , AM3 reduced the diffusion coefficients in the DOPC / Chol membrane more promi - nently than in the SM / Chol membrane ( Fig . 5 ) , suggesting that AM3 more effectively enhances the order of the disordered membrane than that of ordered membrane . It is reported that AM3 forms domain - like aggregate on the membrane [ 18 ] , which may increase the membrane order . We further examined the effect of AM3 on the order of phase - separated membranes . To do this , we prepared Lo - Ld phase - coexistent GUVs composed of SM / DOPC / Chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 in molar ratio ) and treated the GUVs with AM3 at a concentration lower than that it disrupts the phase separation . The Lo and Ld phases in the GUVs were labeled with 594neg - SM and 594neg - DOPC , respectively , and the respective diffusion coefficient was obtained by the FCS measurements ( Fig . 6 ) . As a result , although the addition of AM3 reduces the diffusion coefficients in both the Lo and Ld phases , the reduction is more prominent in the Ld phase than in the Lo phase . This confirms that the effect of AM3 on the membrane order is larger in the Ld phase than in the Lo phase . 4 . Discussion It was reported that AM3 ’ s pore formation is mediated by the direct interaction between AM3 and sterol in membranes [ 17 ] . This action seems to have some resemblance to polyene macrolide antibiotics such as amphotericin B , nystatin , and filipin III . For example , filipin III is known to bind to Chol in membrane and disrupt lipid rafts [ 24 , 25 ] as in the case with M β CD . In addition , because filipin III is reported to accumulate in Chol - rich lipid rafts , it is sometimes used as a raft marker [ 33 ] . Hence we first expected that AM3 also preferentially interacts with Fig . 3 . SPR sensorgrams for the binding of AM3 to the liposomes immobilized on a dodecylamine - modified CM5 sensor chip : DOPC liposomes in the absence or presence of 10 and 30 mol % Chol ( A , B , and C ) , and SM liposomes in the absence or presence of 10 and 30 mol % Chol ( D , E , and F ) . The concentrations of AM3 are 30 ( red ) , 40 ( blue ) , and 50 ( green ) μ M . The association of AM3 was monitored from 0 to 300 s , and its dissociation from the surface was recorded from 300 to 600 s .

In all cases , the final lipid concentration was 27 μ M .

Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports 26 ( 2021 ) 100941 5 raft - like ordered membrane . However , SPR and calcein leakage experi - ments unequivocally revealed that AM3 preferentially binds to Chol existing in a less - ordered DOPC membrane and consequently forms pores more effectively in the DOPC / Chol membrane than in the SM / Chol membrane . Here , the difference in the Chol content in the Lo and Ld phases should be taken into account . The Chol content in the Lo phase of the phase - separated membranes is more than 30 mol % , while that in the Ld phase is less than 20 mol % [ 34 ] . This means that the concentration of Chol is roughly twice larger in Lo phase than in Ld . Therefore , although AM3 preferentially binds to Chol of the Ld phase , the larger content of Chol in the Lo domain arises the concern that a larger amount of AM3 eventually binds to the Lo domain . Although membrane binding and pore formation of AM3 are significantly enhanced in SM / Chol ( 7 : 3 ) membrane compared in SM / Chol ( 9 : 1 ) ( Figs . 3 and 4 , Table 1 ) , those activities are still inferior to those in DOPC / Chol ( 9 : 1 ) . Hence , although Chol content is twice higher in the Lo domain than in the Ld , it can be said that the membrane binding and pore formation of AM3 is more prominent in the Ld domain . To evaluate the SPR data , we adopted two - reaction model following our previous report [ 16 ] . In this model , AM3 ’ s membrane binding is assumed to be composed of two sequential steps ; the first step is binding of AM3 to the membrane surface , and the second step corresponds to the penetration of AM3 to the membrane interior to form more stable complexes probably with sterol . Table 1 not only quantitatively verifies that the overall affinity of AM3 is higher to the DOPC / Chol membrane than to the SM / Chol , but also demonstrates that Chol promotes both the first and second binding steps more efficiently in DOPC membrane than in SM membrane . It is assumed that AM3 recognizes Chol at multiple sites [ 17 , 21 ] ; the tetrahydrofurane rings of AM3 recognizes the 3 - OH group of Chol and the polyene chain of AM3 binds to the hydrophobic sterol skeleton . Based on this multiple recognition between AM3 and Chol , the two - reaction model can be interpreted as follows ; the first process is the contact of AM3 with the Chol ’ s 3 - OH group residing at the water / membrane interface , and the second step corresponds to the interaction between AM3 polyene chain and Chol ’ s hydrophobic skel - eton in the membrane interior . It is known that Chol ’ s 3 - OH group is positioned more deeply in SM membrane than in PC membrane due to so - called umbrella effect [ 35 ] , which should retard the first process of AM3 binding in the SM / Chol membrane . In addition , the interaction between SM and Chol is believed to be much stronger than the PC - Chol interaction [ 36 ] , which would further hinder the second binding process between AM3 and Chol . In other words , AM3 - Chol multiple recognition both at the membrane surface and in the membrane interior proceeds more smoothly in the DOPC membrane than in the SM membrane . Another interesting finding in this study is that AM3 disrupts the Lo - Ld phase - separation of membranes ( Fig . 1 ) . The deformation of GUVs at 35 min in the presence of 22 and 44 μ M AM3 is probably the result of the increase of the outer leaflet surface area by AM3 binding . AM3 bound to the outer leaflet should give rise to asymmetric imbalance of the number of molecules between the outer and inner leaflets , which would increase the curvature in each phase , leading to the deformation of GUVs . After the Lo and Ld phases are merged , the asymmetric imbalance would be eliminated by either or both of the following two processes ; one is the internalization of AM3 , and the other is flip - flop of lipid molecules . Since AM3 can form toroidal - type pores [ 18 ] , it is thought that lipid and AM3 molecules can move easily between the outer and inner leaflets through the pores . Similarly , the disruption of the Lo and Ld phases was observed when phase - separated membranes are treated with Chol - binding re - agents such as M β CD , saponin [ 23 ] , and filipin III [ 24 ] . These reagents are frequently used as raft - disputers in biological studies , although detailed mechanism underlying the raft disruption by those reagents has not been fully disclosed . We recently reported that a local anesthetic dibucaine effectively destroys the Lo - Ld phase separation , which is induced by the reduction of the order of the Lo membranes [ 37 ] . In contrast , our current FCS experiments show that AM3 significantly en - hances the lipid order of disordered membranes ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) and consequently reduces the difference in membrane fluidity between Lo and Ld phases , which likely induces the raft disruption . As described above , AM3 is reported to form domain - like aggregate on the membrane [ 18 ] , which would increase the membrane order . On the other hand , AM3 exerted much less ordering effect on the ordered membranes ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) , probably because AM3 could not further solidify the ordered membrane , which is originally sufficiently rigid . Note that , although AM3 enhances the order of the Ld domains , the diffusion co - efficient of the AM3 - treated Ld phase is still much larger than that of Lo phase ( Fig . 6 ) , indicating that AM3 cannot enhance the order of the Ld phase to a comparable level to the Lo phase . Then how does AM3 disrupt the phase separation ? A possible explanation is that since membrane phase separation is based on a delicate balance of lipid compositions between the Lo and Ld phases , a slight increase in membrane order of the disordered phase would cause an irreversible change in lipid dis - tribution , triggering the disruption of phase separation . In conclusion , we found that AM3 disrupts membrane phase sepa - ration and disclosed its mechanism of action . As mentioned in the Introduction , lipid rafts are believed to play significant functions in signal transduction , and therefore it is not far - fetched to consider that Fig . 6 .

Although the biological activities of AM3 such as antifungal , hemolysis , and cytotoxicity can be mostly accounted for by its pore formation in membrane , the raft - disrupting activity of AM3 may be involved in its known and unknown activities . Since numerous sterol - and lipid - binding reagents are known to date [ 38 ] , the impacts of those reagents on lipid rafts and the subsequent physiological responses would be an interesting research perspective for the future .
