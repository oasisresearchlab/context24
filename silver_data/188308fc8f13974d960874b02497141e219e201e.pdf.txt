Information regarding virus - laden aerosol concentrations is still scarce in community indoors and what are the risks for general public and the efficiency of restriction policies . This work investigates , for the first time in Italy , the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in air samples collected in different community indoors ( one train station , two food markets , one canteen , one shopping centre , one hair salon , and one pharmacy ) in three Italian cities : metropolitan city of Venice ( NE of Italy ) , Bologna ( central Italy ) , and Lecce ( SE of Italy ) . Air samples were collected during the maximum spread of the second wave of pandemic in Italy ( November and December 2020 ) . All collected samples tested negative for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 , using both real - time RT - PCR and ddPCR , and no significant differ - ences were observed comparing samples taken with and without customers . Modelling average concentrations , using influx of customers ’ data and local epidemiological information , indicated low values ( i . e . < 0 . 8 copies m − 3 when cotton facemasks are used and even lower for surgical facemasks ) . The results , even if with some limitations , suggest that the restrictive policies enforced could effectively reduce the risk of airborne transmissions in the community indoor investigated , providing that physical distance is respected .

PCR Introduction The global pandemic due to COVID - 19 disease , related to the coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 , spread all around the world . By 31 December 2020 , infected cases reached 82 , 401 , 782 individ - uals and 1 , 801 , 239 deaths worldwide ( https : / / covid19 . who . int / ) ; 2 , 541 , 783 individuals were infected at the same date in Italy ( about 4 . 3 % of population ) with 88 , 279 deaths . In most countries , a second wave of pandemic was observed in autumn 2020 . In Italy , the second wave started roughly at the beginning of October 2020 and hit all regions contrarily to what happened during the first wave ( winter 2020 ) in which northern Italian regions were severely hit compared to southern regions . This convinced the government to enforce mitigation strategies both at national and regional levels according to the estimated risks in the different regions . Different mechanisms of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission are widely accepted , but the role of airborne transmission in the spread of COVID - 19 started a debate since the beginning of pandemic ( Contini and Costabile 2020 ; Domingo et al . 2020 ; Klompas et al . 2020 ; Morawska and Cao 2020 ; Prather et al . 2020 ; Ram et al . 2021 ) . Currently , even if a large number of studies are available , there are still several aspects not completely understood regarding risks of airborne Responsible Editor : Diane Purchase * Daniele Contini d . contini @ isac . cnr . it 1 Istituto di Scienze dell ’ Atmosfera e del Clima ( ISAC - CNR ) , Str .

Airborne transmission could be due to virus - laden particles emitted by infected individuals . Large droplets settle faster than they evaporate ; in contrast , small droplets leave droplet nuclei ( i . e . dry residuals after total or partial evaporation ) ( Asadi et al . 2020 ; Borouiba 2020 ) . Droplet nuclei , containing virus aggregates , are aero - sols that could stay suspended in air for long time , potentially contributing to airborne transmission ( Allen and Marr 2020 ; Martano 2020 ; Morawska and Cao 2020 ; Tang et al . 2021 ) . One of the most important parameters to ascertain risks of airborne transmission is the concentration of virus - laden particles of different sizes in air ( Chirizzi et al . 2021 ) . However , there is a limited number of studies that investi - gate this aspect in real outdoor and indoor conditions , so that modelling is often applied ( Buonanno et al . 2020 ; Feng et al . 2020 ; Lelieveld et al . 2020 ; Belosi et al . 2021 ) . In residential outdoor conditions , with the exclusion of crowded areas or location near important sources like hos - pitals or quarantine areas , there is a number of evidences that air samples tested negative ( i . e . concentrations under detection limits ) or showed low concentrations of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in atmospheric particles of different sizes ( Liu et al . 2020 ; Hu et al . 2020 ; Chirizzi et al . 2021 ; Dunker et al . 2021 ; Passos et al . 2021 ; Pivato et al . 2021 ) . This suggests that the risk of airborne transmission of COVID - 19 in out - doors is limited if physical distancing form relevant sources is maintained and crowds avoided . The same conclusion was obtained by the modelling results of outdoors concen - tration of virus - laden particles in Lombardy ( northern Italy ) during the first wave of pandemic ( Belosi et al . 2021 ) . In indoor environments , most of the research efforts have been focused on measuring airborne viral particle concentra - tions in hospitals , intensive care units , and quarantine areas showing that concentrations could be higher compared to out - door ( Borges et al . 2021 ; Chia et al . 2020 ; Ge et al . 2020 ; Hu et al . 2020 ; Jin et al . 2020 ; Lednicky et al . 2020 ; Liu et al . 2020 ; Razzini et al . 2020 ; Santarpia et al . 2020 ; Passos et al . 2021 ; Vosoughi et al . 2021 ) . However , other studies reported no detectable airborne viral RNA even in proximity of COVID - 19 patients ( Cheng et al . 2020 ; Faridi et al . 2020 ; Ong et al . 2020 ; Dumont - Leblond et al . 2021 ; Hemati et al . 2021 ) . This underlines that there are difficulties in comparison of results obtained in different studies for several reasons : ( i ) the strength of the source ( number of infected individuals ) ; ( ii ) the absence of a standard measurement protocol ( Borges et al . 2021 ; Pan et al . 2019 ; Robotto et al . 2021 ) ; ( iii ) the influence of specific mitigation strategies ; ( iv ) the role of mechanical ventilation in the different indoors environments and the size of the rooms . For efficient reduction of the spread rate of COVID - 19 , it is important to assess risks of airborne trans - mission in community indoor environments , such as department stores , shopping centres , food supermarkets , pub - lic transport vehicles , restaurants , pharmacies , hair salons , schools and universities , and cinemas and theatres . In addi - tion , it is relevant to understand if the COVID - 19 contrasting measures applied in the different indoor environments ( such as ventilation , filtration , use of facemasks , and limitations to the number of simultaneous customers ) could effectively re - duce these risks in different countries and different cities of the same country . These aspects are essential to plan future strat - egies or to correct ongoing strategies . Measurements of viral particle concentrations in real world conditions in these envi - ronments are very sparse so that , often , risks are evaluated with modelling approaches ( Buonanno et al . 2020 ; Lelieveld et al . 2020 ; Xu et al . 2021 ) . Recently , Xu et al . ( 2021 ) inves - tigated the airborne infection risk of SARS - CoV - 2 in 111 , 485 US public and private schools , evaluating the impacts of dif - ferent mitigation strategies . Results indicated that , among the considered strategies , air filtration was the most effective , with average infection risk over 30 % less than the risk levels esti - mated with the use of increased ventilation and hybrid learn - ing strategies . Some studies studied efficiency of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 using detection and concentration mea - surements of virus traces in air samples . A recent study on a bus , during normal operations in Chieti ( Central Italy ) , collected samples in the first wave of pandemic when re - strictions policies were enforced and reported that all sam - ples tested negative for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Di Carlo et al . 2020 ) . The authors interpreted these negative results as a consequence of the restrictions on the maximum number of passengers , and the use of open windows during bus operation to increase ventilation that effectively re - duced airborne transmission risks . In Moreno et al . ( 2021 ) , six PM 2 . 5 ( i . e . particles with aerodynamic diameter < 2 . 5 μ m ) samples were collected in subway trains in June 2020 . One sample was found positive for one of the three genetic targets of SARS - CoV - 2 searched with RT - PCR and one sample for two genetic targets . Maximum estimated concentration was 23 . 4 copies m − 3 . In the same period ( i . e . June 2020 ) , also six air samples were collected in buses during normal operation , and one sample was found positive for one of the three genetic targets with a concentration of 1 . 4 copies m − 3 . This would suggest that airborne transmission in public transport could be an issue mainly in underground services . Hadei et al . ( 2021 ) inves - tigated community indoor environments in Iran collecting 28 air samples , in different indoor sites that were found to be positive to the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in 64 % of the cases , but no details on viral particle concentrations were reported . Correlation of positivity rates with the use of masks and the number of people were not statistically sig - nificant even if it was observed a slight increase with the number of people suggesting that limitations of customers 13906 Environ Sci Pollut Res ( 2022 ) 29 : 13905 – 13916 allowed in indoors could reduce risk of airborne transmission . This work tries to fill this gap in knowledge of concentra - tions of SARS - CoV - 2 virus - laden particles in community in - doors environments , for the first time in Italy , using measure - ments in different regions of Italy during the second wave of pandemic based on samples collected between 16 November and 21 December 2020 . Measurements were compared with modelling results , done considering real conditions of the dif - ferent environments , estimating the efficiency of the restric - tive policies and of ventilation in reducing concentrations and , consequently , average risk of indoor airborne transmission . Materials and methods Sampling sites and measurement strategy Aerosol samples were collected in different indoor community environments in three Italian regions : Veneto ( North - Eastern Italy ) , Emilia - Romagna ( central Italy ) , and Puglia ( South - Eastern Italy ) during the second wave of COVID - 19 pandemic in the period between 16 November 2020 and 21 December 2020 . These environments have been chosen because they were open also during lockdown or when restrictive measures applied ( even if with some limitations ) and were usually frequented by the public for everyday needs . A summary of the samples col - lected at the different sites , for the determination of the SARS - COV - 2 genetic ( RNA ) material , is reported in Table 1 . At all sites analysed some restrictions were enforced to limit COVID - 19 spread . Specifically , it was compulsory to maintain the phys - ical distancing , there were limits to the maximum number of people simultaneously present indoor , and access was allowed only with body temperature < 37 . 5 °C . It was compulsory to wear masks in all sites , with the exclusion of the canteen ( site S4 ) in which masks were used to enter the premise and when - ever a customer leaves the table , but masks were not used during lunches . Samples were collected using active sampling on quartz filters . This choice was done because it allowed using the methodology already developed for outdoor sites in a previ - ous study ( Chirizzi et al . 2021 ) . In addition , sampling on filters is used in several studies that found both samples positive to SARS - CoV - 2 ( Kayalar et al . 2021 ; Setti et al . 2020 ) and sam - ples negative ( Chirizzi et al . 2021 ; Linillos - Pradillo et al . 2021 ; Passos et al . 2021 ; Pivato et al . 2021 . In Veneto , PM 10 samples were collected at three sites in the metropolitan city of Venice area using quartz fibre filters ( Whatman , 47 mm in diameter ) , pre - fired at 400 °C in a muf - fle furnace , in an automatic sequential low - volume ( 38 . 3 L min − 1 , according to the EN 12341 : 2014 method ) sampler ( Skypost PM - TCR Tecora ) . The site S1 was the internal gal - lery of the Venice - Mestre train station ( Fig . S1 , supplementary material ) in which samples were collected for about 12 h during the day ( roughly between 7am and 7pm ) and during the night ( between 7pm and 7am ) to compare periods with different numbers of travellers . During the pre - pandemic period , the train station was populated by about 80 , 000 people per day , and considering the decrease in the number of people ( about 90 % , data provided by Grandi Stazioni Rail ) , we can estimate a flow of 8000 people per day . The site S2 ( Fig . S2 , supplementary material ) was the supermarket Interspar , in the city centre of Mestre - Venice , in which PM 10 samples were collected during diurnal opening hours ( roughly between 8am and 8pm ) . The volume of the supermarket was 18 , 861 m 3 and the influx was about 2300 customers per day , with a total influx , during the sampling period , of 13 , 600 customers . The supermarket management estimated a decrease of the number of customers of about 25 % compared to the pre - pandemic period , mainly due to lack of tourists . The site S3 was the supermarket Punta Gialla ( A & O ) , located at Cavallino - Treporti , in the metropolitan city of Venice ( Fig . S3 ) , in which diurnal PM 10 samples were taken during opening hours , roughly between 8am and 8pm . The influx was about 1500 of customers per day ( total influx Table 1 Summary of samples collected in the three regions with indication of the measurement periods , of the samples collected , and of the average sampling volume .

The volume of the supermarket is 3520 m 3 ( 1100 m 2 of surface area for a height of 3 . 2 m ) , and it is equipped with a mechanical ventilation system . In Emilia - Romagna , total suspended particle ( TSP ) sam - ples were taken using quartz fibre filters ( 47 mm in diameter ) with a low - volume ( 61 . 7 L min − 1 ) sampler ( Zambelli Explorer pump ) . Mass and particle number concentrations were obtain - ed by means of an optical particle counter ( Grimm , mod . 11 - A ) . Measurements were taken in the canteen of the National Research Council ( CNR ) , an environment ( Fig . S4 ) of about 1700 m 3 ( 500 m 2 of surface area for a height of 3 . 4 m ) equipped with a ventilation system with an airflow of 6250 m 3 / h able to perform about 3 . 7 air exchange per hour ( AER ) . The average number of customers in the sampling period was 159 per day ( range 144 – 172 per day ) . Access is allowed to a maximum of 28 people every 15 min . Each sample was taken for 2 . 5 h during distribution of lunches between 12am and 2 : 30pm , in addition , two background samples were taken be - tween 9am and 12am ( duration 2 . 5 h like the others ) when the canteen was open , but before distribution of lunches . In Puglia , samples were taken using quartz fibre filters ( Whatman ) , pre - fired at 400 °C in a muffle furnace . The site S5a and S5b are the same indoor environment ( commercial centre of Cavallino in Lecce ) in which PM 10 samples were collected with a low - volume ( 38 . 3 L min − 1 ) sequential sam - pler ( Zambelli Explorer Plus ) in two different periods . The two measurement periods correspond to two different restric - tive policies for containment of COVID - 19 spread ( see the “ Epidemiological information and restriction policies during the measurements ” section ) . In this site , samples were taken during diurnal opening hours ( roughly between 9am and 9pm ) and during nocturnal closure hours ( between 9pm and 9am ) . The shopping centre includes 25 shops , 2 eating places , and 1 supermarket for a total volume of 14 , 448 m 3 . Mechanical ventilation insured a flow rate of 72 , 000 m 3 h − 1 with about 5 exchange of air per hour . The sampler was located in the gallery in front of the main entrance / exit of the supermarket ( Fig . S5 ) where most of the customers are passing through . The shopping centre had a total influx of about 30 , 000 cus - tomers during the sampling period S5a that raised to about 80 , 000 in the sampling period S5b . The maximum number of people simultaneously inside was of about 1400 customers . The site S6 ( Fig . S6 ) was a hair salon ( Lounge Parrucchieri Philosophy ) in Lecce with a volume of 280 m 3 relying on natural ventilation ( also maintaining the doors open during pandemic ) and with a maximum number of three customers simultaneously allowed inside . During the measurement peri - od , it had an average of 4 customers per day with an estimated reduction of 30 % compared to the pre - pandemic period . In this site , samples were collected with an in - house built manual TSP sampler operating at low - volume ( 13 . 4 L min − 1 ) during opening hours roughly between 9 : 30am and 5pm . The site S7 was a pharmacy ( Fig . S7 ) in Lecce ( Moschettini ) with a vol - ume of 410 m 3 and a maximum number of six customers simultaneously allowed inside . Mechanical ventilation in - sured 920 m 3 h − 1 for about 2 . 2 air exchanges per hour . In site S7 , samples were taken during opening hours , roughly be - tween 9 : 30am and 5 : 30pm . The average number of daily cus - tomers during the measurements was 280 ( range 252 – 305 ) with no significant changes compared to the same period of the year 2019 . In some previous studies , indoor sampling was done for different size fractions . Liu et al . ( 2020 ) collected air samples in indoor environments in hospitals in China and detected SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in the size range 0 . 25 – 1 μ m and in the range > 2 . 5 μ m . The indoor measurements in Singapore hos - pitals ( Chia et al . 2020 ) showed that the smallest aerodynamic size fraction that contained detectable levels of SARS - CoV - 2 was 1 – 4 μ m but the virus was detectable also in particles of sizes > 4 μ m . Stern et al . ( 2021 ) collected samples in a Boston ( Massachusetts , USA ) hospital in three size ranges ( > 10 μ m , 10 – 2 . 5 μ m , and < 2 . 5 μ m ) finding that SARS - CoV - 2 genetic material was present in all size fractions . Therefore , the choice to sample PM 10 and TSP , that includes all size ranges men - tioned , appears to be adequate to detect eventual presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in air . The sampling volume is different from site to site depend - ing on both , the flow - rate of the sampler used and the opening hours of the site studied . The average sampling volumes used at the different sites ( Table 1 ) are comparable , or even larger , with the values used in several other studies focused on deter - mination of airborne SARS - CoV - 2 in indoor environments . For example , Stern et al . ( 2021 ) sampled different size frac - tions at 5 L min − 1 for 14 . 4 m 3 of total volume ; Moreno et al . ( 2021 ) sampled PM 2 . 5 at 10 L min − 1 for volume ranging be - tween 5 . 2 m 3 and 6 . 2 m 3 ; Di Carlo et al . ( 2020 ) used 24 L min − 1 to sample 18 . 7 m 3 of TSP ; Razzini et al . ( 2020 ) sampled TSP at 50 L min − 1 for total volumes of 2 m 3 ; Hadei et al . ( 2021 ) used two samplers at different flow rate for TSP sam - pling between 0 . 2 and 3 . 5 m 3 ; Passos et al . ( 2021 ) used low - volume and high - volume samplers in different sites with sam - pled volumes ranging from 0 . 12 up to 120 m 3 . After sampling , all samples were frozen , at − 25 °C for the site in Emilia - Romagna region and at − 80 °C for the sites in Veneto and Puglia regions , immediately after sampling for conservation until the successive analysis . Analytical method for RNA detection The approach and methodology used is essentially the same used for a previous study on outdoor samples ( Chirizzi et al . 2021 ) . RNA extraction was done using Total RNA Purification Kit ( Norgen Biotek Corp . ) with a modified pro - tocol to increase yield . Each filter was cut and placed inside a 13908 Environ Sci Pollut Res ( 2022 ) 29 : 13905 – 13916 2 - mL centrifuge tube containing 1 - mL of phosphate buffer solution ( PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) . The tube was sealed and treated in a sonicator bath for 30 min . Particle deposit was separated by centrifugation using a mini syringe placed in a collection tube . The pellet obtained was resuspended in 350 μ L of superna - tant , according to the manufacture ’ s protocol . The final eluted solutions ( between 60 and 70 μ L in total ) were frozen at − 80 ± 2 °C and stored until analysis . Molecular analysis for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 was carried out using real - time RT - PCR and droplet digital PCR ( ddPCR ) technologies . According to World Health Organization ( WHO ) , real - time RT - PCR represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 ; however , ddPCR has demonstrated the best performance to detect SARS - CoV - 2 , because it reduces the false negatives with a high sensitivity and accuracy of 95 . 5 % ( Suo et al . 2020 ; Dong et al . 2021 ) . In the present study , real - time RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 was carried out on a CFX96 TM Real - Time system ( Bio - Rad , Italy ) using GeneFinder TM COVID - 19 Plus Real Amp Kit ( OSANG Healthcare , Korea ) . The GeneFinder TM COVID - 19 Plus Real Amp Kit is a One - Step real - time reverse transcription ( RT - PCR ) multiplex assay based on fluorescent - labelled probe used to confirm the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA by amplifi - cation of RdRp , N , and E genes . The kit provides all the reagents required for the analysis , PCR positive and PCR negative controls included . Five microliters of extracted RNA was added to 15 μ L of master mix for each sample and analysed according to kit instructions . Undiluted and 1 : 10 diluted samples were tested . In each run , two negative controls ( molecular grade water ) and a positive control were added . The interpretation of the sample results was done according to kit instructions . In detail , a sample was considered positive for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 when the Ct for at least one or both of the RdRp or N genes was ≤ 40 . The limit of detection ( LOD ) of the GeneFinder TM COVID - 19 Plus Real Amp Kit was declared by the manu - facturer in 10 copies / reaction , equal to 2 copies / μ l for all genes . The ddPCR assay was performed according to the protocol described by Alteri et al . ( 2020 ) on QX200TM Droplet Digital TM PCR system ( Bio - Rad , Italy ) . The assay is a home - made reverse transcription ( RT ) droplet digital PCR ( ddPCR ) protocol designed for the quantitative detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA with the One - Step RT - ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes ( Bio - Rad , Italy ) . The method consists in a du - plex targeting the RNA dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp ) of SARS - CoV - 2 and the housekeeping gene RNAse P , as reported by CDC , into a single assay multiplex to enable a one - well reaction . The reaction mixtures were separated into approximately 20 , 000 droplets using a QX200 Droplet Generator TM ( Bio - Rad , Italy ) with random dispersal of target nucleic acids into the droplets . The PCR assays were performed in a C1000 Touch TM Thermal Cycler ( Bio - Rad , Italy ) . After amplification , the droplets were individually assayed using the QX200 TM Droplet Reader TM . The fluores - cence data were then analysed by the QuantaSoft v1 . 7 Software ( Bio - Rad , Italy ) to determine the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in the specimen . The LOD of the ddPCR assay was previously estimated by Alteri et al . ( 2020 ) in 2 . 9 copies / reaction , equal to 0 . 58 copies / μ L . For comparison , the methodology used by Liu et al . ( 2020 ) had a LOD of 2 . 18 copies / reaction and that used by Pivato et al . ( 2021 ) had a LOD of 2 . 5 copies / μ L . Analysis of RNA recovery The efficiency of the extraction and sample conservation procedures was estimated evaluating the recovery of a pro - cess control ; a virus appositely added on filters prior to acid nucleic extraction . Mengovirus strain MC 0 , supplied by Istituto Superiore di Sanità ( ISS , Rome , Italy ) , was used as process control . The efficiency of the extraction method was evaluated comparing the Ct values obtained for Mengovirus on samples extracts with a reference . In detail , 10 μ L of Mengovirus was added to ( i ) 1 mL of PBS ( refer - ence sample ) ; ( ii ) 1 mL of PBS with a blank filter ; and ( iii ) 1 mL of PBS in an environmental filter . The detection of Mengovirus was done using a CFX96 TM Real - Time system ( Bio - Rad , Italy ) using amplification conditions , primers , and probe and reagents RNA UltraSense TM One - Step Quantitative RT - PCR System ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) ( Pintó et al . 2009 ) . Different cases were analysed for recovery analysis : one set of filters were spiked with Mengovirus in laboratory and di - rectly extracted ; a second set of filters were spiked and frozen at − 25 °C and successively extracted with the other samples ; a third set of filters were spiked and mounted in one of the samplers ( the PM 10 sampler in Lecce without effective sam - pling on them ) . Results indicate a recovery of 69 % ( ± 8 % standard error ) for the first set of filters immediately extracted after spiking ( with no effects of sample conservation ) . The recovery of the second set of filters , those conserved at − 25 °C , gave a recovery of 62 % ( ± 14 % standard error ) , thereby comparable with the first set . This means that conservation at − 25 °C did not significantly change the recovery . The third set gave a slightly lower recovery , equal to 54 % ( ± 13 % standard error ) , suggesting that the use of filters inside the sampler reduces the recovery . This value is in agreement with that observed in a previous study ( Chirizzi et al . 2021 ) . Our recovery is lower than the recovery ( almost 100 % ) claimed in Passos et al . ( 2021 ) after a test on different sampling substrates that behaved similarly ( cellulose nitrate filters , PTFE filters , and quartz filters ) . On the other hand , it is larger than the recovery ( about 20 % ) observed in Hadei et al . ( 2021 ) with sampling on PTFE filters . It must be said 13909 Environ Sci Pollut Res ( 2022 ) 29 : 13905 – 13916 that the relatively large standard errors in our data indicate a variability likely due to a matrix effect , for example resid - ual fibres of the filters extracted during the procedure . Another aspect is that conservation at room temperature seems to significantly decrease the recovery , even if sys - tematic tests are not available . Therefore , in order to im - prove detection of SARS - CoV - 2 genetic material and to make more comparable results obtained in different studies , it would be necessary to test recovery in different condi - tions and over different substrates developing an opportune protocol for sampling and conservation of samples . The necessity of a standardised protocol for sampling , conser - vation of samples , and analysis , is also mentioned by Yun et al . ( 2020 ) , Borges et al . ( 2021 ) , and by Robotto et al . ( 2021 ) . Epidemiological information and restriction policies during the measurements During autumn 2020 , starting roughly at the beginning of October , a second wave of pandemic hit Italy . It spread all over Italy even if with different intensity in the different re - gions . This leads to the introduction of restrictive policies at national and regional levels in different periods ( Fig . 1 ) in addition to the social distancing and no crowd measures al - ready enforced since winter 2020 . Specifically , on 13 October , at national level , the use of facemasks in outdoor and indoor environments , the closure of gyms and pools , the closure of congresses and limitations for parties and religious ceremo - nies , and the closure of discos were enforced . Limitation for restaurants and pub were enforced favouring delivery and take away . In addition , limitation to schools and university activi - ties with use of distance learning was enforced . On 3rd November , regional restrictions were enforced on the basis of three “ colours ” ( i . e . yellow , orange , and red ) that corre - spond to different risk of the spread of contagion . In red re - gions ( i . e . maximum risk ) , movements of people were not allowed ( with exception for work , health , and emergency rea - sons ) ; shops were closed with the exclusion of necessary shops ( such as food markets ) ; and restaurants were closed being allowed only delivery of take away until 10pm . In or - ange regions ( i . e . intermediate risk ) , movements of people were allowed in the same municipality between 5am and 10pm , and shops were opened with the exclusion of restau - rants ( could operate only with delivery or take away ) and commercial centres that are closed during weekends ( and holydays ) . In yellow regions ( i . e . low risk ) , the movements of peoples were allowed between 5am and 10pm , shops were opened including restaurants and bars ( but limited to 6pm , afterwards only delivery or take away ) , and commercial cen - tres closed during weekends and holydays with the exclusion of food markets . Figure 1 reports the daily number of new contagions ( source , Italian Ministry of Health ) in the three regions ( bars ) and in the three metropolitan areas ( lines ) in which samples were taken . The colour of the bars indicates the re - strictions that were active during the different periods . Measurements in Venice ( for sites S1 , S2 , and S3 ) were done in yellow periods ; the site S4 in Bologna was studied in or - ange period ; samples in site S5 in Lecce were taken in both orange period ( S5a ) and yellow period ( S5b ) for comparison . Site S6 was studied in orange period and site S7 in yellow period . Discussion of results All collected samples tested negative for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 genetic material , with both analysis real - time RT - PCR and ddPCR , either for samples collected during opening hours and for samples collected during closure hours ( i . e . absence of customers ) . This means either that the SARS - CoV - 2 genetic material is absent in the samples taken or that the concentrations are lower than the detection threshold of the methodology used . The LOD ( genome copies μ L − 1 ) was transformed in detection thresholds for atmospheric concen - trations of viral particles ( expressed in copies m − 3 ) estimating the threshold of viral particles contained in a single filter ( i . e . RNA copies per filter ) . This was done considering the total volume of extraction solutions . Results were successively nor - malised by the average sampled volume in each condition to obtain the thresholds . In sites S1 , S2 , and S3 , located in Venice area , the estimated concentrations of virus - laden par - ticles in PM 10 were < 1 . 3 copies m − 3 . In site S4 in Bologna area , the estimated concentrations of virus - laden particles in TSP were < 4 copies m − 3 . In site S5a and S5b in Lecce area the estimated concentrations of virus - laden particles were < 1 . 5 copies m − 3 and < 5 . 5 copies m − 3 for sites S6 and S7 . The differences in the thresholds of the various sites ( summarised in Table 2 ) are due to the different sampling times and flow rates being the LOD constant . Thresholds are not often report - ed in previous studies ; however , these values are comparable , for example , with the detection limit of 1 . 2 copies m − 3 report - ed by Pivato et al . ( 2021 ) . To better understand if the conditions at the different sites , including the epidemiological situations of the different areas , are compatible with negative results , the average expected concentrations in the different indoor environments were in - vestigated making some assumptions on emission rate ( E ) of virus - laden aerosol from infected individuals , on the number of expected infected customers ( n ) , and on the distribution of particles in the different environments considering their vol - umes and their ventilation characteristics . When a continuous source of particles is activated at time t = 0 , in an otherwise clean room of volume V , having a ventilation airflow equal 13910 Environ Sci Pollut Res ( 2022 ) 29 : 13905 – 13916 to Q , the concentration C ( t ) could be expressed , neglecting dry deposition , by Bhagat et al .

When the source is turned off , for exam - ple the infected individuals leave the room , the concentration will decrease from the initial value C i that has been reached before the cutoff of the source : C t ð Þ ¼ C i e − t τ ð 2 Þ Previous equations are based on the assumption that the air is well - mixed within the modelled space and particles are instantaneously and evenly distributed in the room ( Gammaitoni and Nucci 1997 ) . This approach is reasonable when details of geometries and airflows in the different mi - croenvironments are not known , and it has been previously applied to study indoor risk of airborne SARS - CoV - 2 ( Buonanno et al . 2020 ) . There could be some uncertainties associated with the assumption that the air is well - mixed and particles are instantaneously and evenly distributed in the room , because , for example , concentrations might be higher in poorly ventilated parts of the room . The emission E of viral RNA copies , without use of masks , can be estimated using a mass balance approach between the viral load in mouth ( C V ) and the volume of particles emitted during respiration and speaking , as done in previous studies ( Buonanno et al . 2020 ; Belosi et al . 2021 ) . An average E of 7000 copies h − 1 is evaluated assuming Cv = 10 9 copies mL − 1 ( Buonanno et al . 2020 ) ; and assuming the size distribution of respiration droplets , divided in four size ranges ( Morawska et al . 2009 ) and averaged between unmodulated vocalization and voiced counting ; the inhalation rate for light exercise , averaged between male and female , equal to 1 . 38 m 3 h − 1 ( Adams 1993 ) . The emission rate used in these simulations is an average value already used in several other studies ; there could be a high variability of the viral load and a strong de - pendency on the day of detection compared to the onset of COVID - 19 . In addition , there could be super - spreaders which have much higher emission rate that can create more critical situation sin indoor environments . The results of Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are linearly dependent on the emission rates so that the calculated concentrations will linearly increase with average emission rate . This emission rate is reduced by the use of facemasks . The filtration efficiency , for removal of particles , of every - day masks depends on eventual leakages , on the type of mask , and on the size of particles . We consider two types of masks , widely used by the public in everyday life : surgical masks and cotton masks . For surgical masks , the efficiency ( Balachandar et al . 2020 ) for the four size ranges of respiratory particles considered here ( i . e . the same range from 0 . 9 ( at diameter of 0 . 8 μ m ) to 0 . 99 ( at diameter of 5 . 5 μ m ) ; for cotton masks the efficiency ranges from 0 . 1 to 0 . 7 in the same size ranges ( Balachandar et al . 2020 ) . The reduction on emitted viral load depends also on content of virus - laden aerosol in each one of the four size range that could be evaluated with the mentioned mass balance approach ( Buonanno et al . 2020 ) . Considering the viral load in each of the four size ranges , the cumulative efficiency in reduction of E would be 98 % for surgical masks and 58 % for the cotton masks . Equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) could be used for estimating expected concentra - tions in the sites studied , taking into account the epidemiolog - ical conditions of the three cities at the time of sampling , in order to compare with the results obtained in collected air samples . The epidemiological analysis of the Venice area indicates an average number of currently infected people per thousand of inhabitants roughly equal to 12 during the sampling period ( source , Regional Health Agency of Veneto ) . Considering the average daily number of customers at site S2 , about 2300 distributed in the opening hours , it is reasonable to assume an average of about 2 . 3 infected individuals per hour inside . Details on ventilation are not known for this site ; however , it could be estimated a reasonable airflow considering the guide - line UNI10339 of 2014 in which an airflow for medium ven - tilation of 7 L min − 1 per person is suggested for these envi - ronments calculated using an occupancy of 0 . 2 person m − 2 . For the case of sites S2 and S3 , an air exchange rate of 1 . 6 per hour is obtained . The expected steady - state average concen - trations for site S2 will be 0 . 01copies m − 3 using surgical masks and 0 . 2 copies m − 3 using cotton masks . The expected average concentration will rise to 0 . 5 copies m − 3 if use of facemasks would not be enforced . For site S3 , using the same value of the air exchange rate of site S2 and the average ex - pected number of 1 . 5 infected individuals per hour inside , a steady state average concentration of 0 . 04 copies m − 3 is ob - tained considering surgical masks and of 0 . 8 copies m − 3 con - sidering cotton masks . The expected average concentration will rise to 1 . 8 copies m − 3 if use of facemasks would not be enforced . These are low concentrations , especially consider - ing that surgical masks are the most diffused in Italy , compat - ible with the negative results found on collected samples . The epidemiological data of Emilia - Romagna region indi - cated an average number of currently infected people per thousand of inhabitant equal to 16 during the sampling period at site S4 ( source , Regional Health Agency of Emilia - Romagna ) . This regional data has been preferred in compari - son to metropolitan value , for this site , because the canteen is used by CNR employees and a relevant fraction of them live in different towns and provinces of Emilia - Romagna region . Considering the average number of customers ( 159 per day ) , it is reasonable to expect , on average , 2 infected customers per day . Taking into account an average permanence time of 30 min , it is possible to think at two scenarios : the first is with two infected customers present in the same shift ; the second is with one infected customer in two successive shifts . Using previous equations in the first scenario , the average concentrations in the sampling period will be 0 . 6 copies m − 3 ( the maximum will 13912 Environ Sci Pollut Res ( 2022 ) 29 : 13905 – 13916 be 1 . 9 copies m − 3 ) ; in this case , concentrations are obtained without use of facemasks . The maximum concentration is evaluated at the end of the concentration growing period ( Eq . 1 ) equal to 30 min ( i . e . the permanence time in scenario 1 ) . The second scenario has a similar average but a lower maximum ( 1 . 1 copies m − 3 after 60 min ) . In both cases , the average concentrations are quite low and compatible with the negative results obtained in collected samples . Size distribu - tions at site S4 during opening hours and background periods are compared in Fig . 2 that shows an increase of particles concentration mainly for particles with D > 1 μ m . By com - parison , the average concentration of these large particles in the different sampling periods ranges between 158 , 000 m − 3 and 225 , 000 m − 3 ( average 190 , 000 m − 3 ) , as shown in Fig . 2 . The epidemiological data of Lecce municipality indicated an average number of currently infected people per thousand of inhabitants equal to 2 . 9 during the sampling period S5a and equal to 2 . 2 during the sampling period S5b ( source , Regional Health Agency of Lecce ) . These numbers are essentially the same at province level . In the worst conditions at the commer - cial centre studied in Lecce ( S5a and S5b ) , 1400 customers were counted simultaneously present inside with an average permanence time variable between 30 and 60 min . This time is significantly larger than the time constant of the structure ( about 12 min ) so that it is reasonable to assume that an equi - librium concentration will be reached in these conditions . This will be 0 . 01 copies m − 3 when surgical masks are considered , about 0 . 16 copies m − 3 when cotton masks are considered , and 0 . 4 copies m − 3 when facemasks are not used . These are very low concentrations , even if evaluated in the worst conditions , compatible with the negative tests found on PM 10 collected samples . The number of daily customers for the hair salon ( site S6 ) is small ; the probability to have an infected person during the sampling period is about 4 % ; thereby , it is reason - able to think that the negative results could also be due to the absence of infected people inside during the measurement period . It has also to be mentioned that customers are usually received with an agreed scheduling so that the probability to have two people inside simultaneously is essentially negligi - ble . In site S7 , considering the average number of customers per day , there is a probability of 70 % to have one infected customer in each day of measurements . Assuming an average permanence time of 10 min , this will give an estimated average concentration , in the period of 90 min necessary to reach maximum concentration ( 10 min ) and decreasing back to 5 % of the maximum ( 80 min ) of 0 . 02 copies m − 3 when surgical masks are considered , 0 . 3 copies m − 3 for cotton masks , and 0 . 8 copies m − 3 if facemasks are not used . These concentrations are effectively low and compatible with the negative results found on collected samples . Results of measurements and simulations for the different sites are summarised in Table 2 to allow a better comparison . Limitations and uncertainties of this study Currently , there is not a standard protocol for the study of airborne SARS - CoV - 2 , and this leads to limited ability to compare results from different studies . The protocol used in this work was developed based on previous experience on outdoor detection of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Chirizzi et al . 2021 ) and Fig . 2 Size distributions of particles in site S4 during opening hours and during background conditions ( absence of customers ) . Number concentrations of particles with D > 1 μ m during the four sampling periods at site S4 and the average background value . The number of daily customers is included 13913 Environ Sci Pollut Res ( 2022 ) 29 : 13905 – 13916 on the expertise of available studies published since the be - ginning of pandemic . The negative results found on collected samples are not uncommon also in other published indoor studies ; the recent review by Borges et al . ( 2021 ) , on detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in indoor environments , shows that negative results were found in 10 studies ( out of 25 ) , while 15 of the studies showed positive results in at least one sample . Our results mean that concentrations of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in the studied sites and in the specific sampling periods are lower that the detection limits ( LODs ) reported in Table 2 . It is possible that , lowering the detection limits , for example with larger sampling vol - umes , the virus could have been detected ; however , concen - trations would have been lower that the indicated LODs . We do not know exactly how many infected customers were present at the different sites during sampling , and it is also possible that no infected people were present . However , the epidemiological situations of the different studied area , together with the detected number of customers , would sug - gest that the possibility to have some infected customers is not negligible ( Table 2 ) . In addition , it should be mentioned that samples were collected in a limited number of indoor environ - ments and in specific periods so that they do not exclude that there could be other indoors , for example small and poorly ventilated , or other periods more critical regarding airborne concentrations of SARS - CoV - 2 . Conclusions The presence of airborne SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was investi - gated in different community indoor environments ( one train station , one commercial centre , two supermarkets , one canteen , one hair salon , and one pharmacy ) in three Italian metropolitan areas : Venice ( Veneto Region , NE of Italy ) , Bologna ( Emilia - Romagna region , central Italy ) , and Lecce ( Puglia region , SE of Italy ) . During the sampling periods at the different sites , national and regional measures to contrast COVID - 19 spreads were enforced . In the differ - ent sites , 59 air samples were collected during diurnal hours when customers were present in the different indoor envi - ronments , and 23 background samples were taken in ab - sence of customers . All collected air samples tested nega - tive for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 , and no significant differences were observed comparing samples taken with and without customers in the different indoor environments studied , meaning that SARS - CoV - 2 RNA concentrations were lower than the detection limits of the protocols used ( Table 2 ) . Modelling of expected average concentrations in the different environments , done using influx of customers data and local epidemiological information , indicated low values ( i . e . < 0 . 04 copies m − 3 when surgical masks are used and < 0 . 8 copies m − 3 when cotton masks are used ) for the different sites with the exclusion of the canteen in which no facemasks are used during the lunch and average concen - tration of 0 . 6 copies m − 3 could be estimated . These values are compatible with the negative results obtained in collect - ed samples . The results , even if with the limitation stated in the previous section , suggest that mechanical ventilations and limitation to the number of customers are very important aspects for reduc - ing airborne concentrations of SARS - CoV - 2 and the same apply for the use of facemasks . These are aspects targeted by restrictive measures adopted at both national and regional levels , and results suggest that they are important for reducing virus - laden particle concentrations in the studied community indoor environments , reducing , consequently , the risks for air - borne transmission , providing that physical distance is maintained . However , further studies are needed to improve air sam - pling technologies that can detect the presence of aerosolized viruses , effectively collect them and maintain their viability , and determine their distribution in aerosol particles .
