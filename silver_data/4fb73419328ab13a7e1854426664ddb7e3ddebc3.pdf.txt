The Measurement of Diversity Diversity is a measure of the spread of capital across an equity index or market . Diversity is lower when capital is concentrated mostly into a few large stocks , and is higher when capital is spread more uniformly . Changes in diversity are caused by the ebb and ﬂow of capital between larger and smaller stocks . Diversity is measured by a function D p of the cap weights of the index . Suppose we have an index of n stocks with cap weights w 1 , . . . , w n , so w 1 + · · · + w n = 1 . The diversity of this index is D p ( w 1 , . . . , w n ) = (cid:181) n p − 1 n (cid:88) i = 1 w pi (cid:182) 1 / p , where p is a constant 0 < p < 1 . D p reaches its maximum value of 1 if all the weights are equal , and it reaches its minimum value when all the capital is concentrated into a single stock . The value of p used for the S & P 500 Index is p = . 76 , and we shall use this value in the illustrations that follow . In Figure 1 we see the cap weight distribution of a hypothetical index of 20 stocks . ( The distribution in Figure 1 actually corresponds to the percentiles of the cap - weighted S & P 500 on December 31 , 1997 . ) The diversity of this 20 - stock index , as measured by D . 76 , is . 8396 . 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 Figure 1 : 20 - Stock index , D . 76 = . 8396 .

The next two ﬁgures show modiﬁcations of this index with higher and lower diversity . 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 Figure 2 : More diverse distribution , D . 76 = . 8676 . 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 Figure 3 : Less diverse distribution , D . 76 = . 8105 . In Figure 2 , some of the capital has been removed from the larger stocks and redis - tributed among the smaller stocks : for example , the weight of the largest stock has declined from about 34 % to about 29 % . The logarithmic increase in diversity when going from the distribution in Figure 1 to that of Figure 2 is 3 . 28 % . Figure 3 has more capital in the larger 2 stocks and less in the smaller stocks , so it has lower diversity : the change in diversity in going from Figure 1 to Figure 3 is − 3 . 53 % . This means that the diversity of the distribution in Figure 2 is 6 . 81 % higher than the diversity of the distribution in Figure 3 . As can be seen from these charts , changes in diversity represent the movement of capital between larger stocks and smaller stocks . Historically , the diversity of the market has been variable over the short term , but stable and mean reverting over the long term . Figure 4 shows the cumulative changes in diversity for the Center for Research in Security Prices ( CRSP ) U . S . equity market database over the period from 1927 to 1997 . The chart shows only changes caused by capital gains or losses among the stocks . Changes in diversity caused by changes in the composition of the market or by corporate actions such as takeovers or spinoﬀs are not included . % - 20 - 10 0 10 20 27 30 33 36 39 42 45 48 51 54 57 60 63 66 69 72 75 78 81 84 87 90 93 96 Figure 4 : Cumulative changes in D . 76 , 1927 – 1997 .
