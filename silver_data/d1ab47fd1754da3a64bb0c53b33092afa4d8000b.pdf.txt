PicoTales : Collaborative Authoring of Animated Stories using Handheld Projectors Simon Robinson , Elina Vartiainen , Matt Jones , Gary Marsden Photo : http : / / www . ﬂickr . com / photos / kodomut / 3616896096 / Mobile Stories ( Fails et al . ) TellTable ( Cao et al . ) KidPad ( Druin et al . ) UbiSketch ( Weibel et al . ) { Background • Handheld projector interaction – Cao et al . • Multi - user handheld projection – Willis et al . • Projected collaboration – Shilkrot et al . • Flashlights , lasers – Ghali et al . , Olsen et al . • Sensor - based mobile spatial interaction – Williamson et al . Pico projector Nokia 5800 Sensor pack Our approach : PicoTales ( interaction video ) ( interaction video ) Beneﬁts • Sketch storytelling anywhere • No extra tracking systems required • Automatic recording & rendering of projected content for later reuse • Projection as input Research questions • 1 : Technical : Can we track story authors’ positions and movements accurately enough ? • 2 : Authoring : How do people use the system to animate stories ? • 3 : Viewing : To what extent can other people understand the stories that are created ? Technical evaluation • Q1 : Can we track story authors’ positions and movements accurately enough ? • 16 participants ( 8M ; 8F ) , working in pairs • Calibration tasks : • 3 distances from a wall ; 5 distances from each other • Tracking tasks : • 3 distances from a wall ; 14 target markers Technical : results Primary position estimation accuracy 0 . 0 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 D i s t a n c e f r o m s u r f a c e ( m ) 0 . 5 median mean min , max Projection surface Actual distances Distance estimates • Closer = more accurate Authoring evaluation • Q2 : How do people use the system to animate stories ? • 6 pairs of story authors • Sketch a story ; move to animate • No pre - planning • Narrate while authoring • Think aloud during playback Authoring : results ( animation video ) Authoring : results ( animation video ) ( animation video ) Authoring : results ( animation video ) ( animation video ) Authoring : results ( animation video ) Authoring : results • Projection technique appreciated • Simple interface can be a beneﬁt • But : tracking accuracy improvements needed “The simplicity is a good thing , because it takes away the focus on the technology rather than the story” “Overall the drawing was ﬁne but the positioning was slightly off ” “I liked it ; I wanted to draw more than one character at once” “The likeness is spot on but they’re not quite in unison” Viewing • Q3 : To what extent can other people understand the stories that are created ? • 79 participants ; web - based ; subtitled video • Rate : • understanding ; utility ; sketches , interaction Viewing : results Measure Result Understanding 4 . 7 ( sd : 1 . 7 ) Do sketches match story 4 . 7 ( sd : 1 . 5 ) Usefulness of animations 4 . 0 ( sd : 1 . 7 ) Were interactions meaningful 4 . 0 ( sd : 1 . 6 ) Was low resolution a problem 3 . 3 ( sd : 1 . 8 ) Viewing : results • Story understanding & meaningful sketched interactions depended on sketch quality vs . Summar y • Sensor - based tracking shows potential • Accuracy improvements needed for more effective authoring • Stories are still understandable by other people who have no experience of the system Future work • Technical : • Accuracy improvements • Interface enhancements • Authoring : • Post - storytelling editing • Performative projection Thank you Contact : cssimonr @ swan . ac . uk Research funded by EPSRC projects EP / J000604 / 1 and EP / I001778 / 1 .
