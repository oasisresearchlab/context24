METHODS : Nationwide case series of 2143 pediatric patients with COVID - 19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16 to February 8 , 2020 were included . The epidemic curves were constructed by key dates of disease onset and case diagnosis . Onset - to - diagnosis curves were constructed by fitting a log - normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates . RESULTS : There were 731 ( 34 . 1 % ) laboratory - confirmed cases and 1412 ( 65 . 9 % ) suspected cases . The median age of all patients was 7 years ( interquartile range : 2 - 13 ) , and 1213 cases ( 56 . 6 % ) were boys . Over 90 % of all patients were asymptomatic , mild , or moderate cases . The median time from illness onset to diagnoses was 2 days ( range : 0 to 42 days ) . There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic and then there was a gradual and steady decrease . Disease rapidly spread from Hubei Province to surrounding provinces over time . More children were infected in Hubei province than any other province . CONCLUSIONS : Children at all ages appeared susceptible to COVID - 19 , and there was no significant gender difference . Although clinical manifestations of children’s COVID - 19 cases were generally less severe than those of adults’ patients , young children , particularly infants , were vulnerable to infection . The distribution of children’s COVID - 19 cases varied with time and space , and most of the cases concentrated in Hubei province and surrounding areas . Furthermore , this study provides strong evidence for human - to - human transmission . Key words : 2019 coronavirus disease ; acute respiratory disease ; mortality ; transmission by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics In early December 2019 , a number of pneumonia cases of unknown origins emerged in Wuhan , Hubei province , China . 1 , 2 Most of these patients reported exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market selling many species of live animals . The disease has rapidly spread , domestically , to other parts of China , and globally , to many countries across 6 continents . On 3 January 2020 , a novel member of enveloped RNA coronavirus was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and subsequently confirmed as the cause of this disease by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( China CDC ) . 3 - 5 On 7 January 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) named it as the 2019 novel coronavirus ( i . e . , 2019 - nCoV ) . On 11 February 2020 , WHO named the illness associated with 2019 - nCoV as the 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) . Emergence of 2019 - nCoV has attracted global attention , and WHO has declared the COVID - 19 a public health emergency of international concern ( PHEIC ) . 6 Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) in Guangdong , China , in 2003 , WHO has declared 5 PHEICs : H1N1 ( 2009 ) , polio ( 2014 ) , Ebola in West Africa ( 2014 ) , Zika ( 2016 ) , and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( 2019 ) . Declaring a PHEIC is an urgent call , at the highest level , for the international community to launch a global coordinated effort to stop the outbreak , which requires strong public health response , high - level political commitment and sufficient funding . As of 2 March 2020 , a total of 80174 COVID - 19 cases in China and 8774 cases in 64 countries ( and regions ) have been confirmed . 7 Despite the worldwide spread , the epidemiological and clinical patterns of the COVID - 19 remain largely unclear , particularly among children . In this study , we explored the epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns of 2143 pediatric patients with COVID - 19 in mainland China . Methods by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics Data Sources We conducted a retrospective study on the epidemiological characteristics of 2143 pediatric patients with COVID - 19 . Children were defined as being less than 18 years old . The cases were initially diagnosed on the basis of clinical manifestations and exposure history . 8 , 9 Within the last 2 weeks , if a child exposed to a COVID - 19 case , or lived in an epidemic area ( i . e . , Hubei province ) or community where COVID - 19 case ( s ) were reported , or in a non - epidemic area where no COVID - 19 case ( s ) were reported , s / he was defined as having high , medium or low risk , respectively , based on the possibility of contracting the disease . Suspected cases were identified if a child at high risk had two of the following conditions : 1 ) fever or respiratory symptoms or digestive symptoms ( e . g . , vomiting , nausea and diarrhea ) or fatigue ; 2 ) laboratory test : white blood cell count is normal or decreased or with lymphocyte count or increased level of C - reactive protein ; 3 ) abnormal chest X - ray imaging . For a child at medium or low risk , similar diagnostic criteria were applied after excluding influenza and other common respiratory infections . Suspected cases who met any one of the following criteria were defined as confirmed cases : 1 . Nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens or blood samples tested positive for 2019 - nCoV nucleic acid using real - time reverse - transcriptase polymerase - chain - reaction ( RT - PCR ) assay ; 2 . Genetic sequencing of respiratory tract or blood samples is highly homologous with 2019 - nCoV . The severity of COVID - 19 was defined based on the clinical features , laboratory testing and chest X - ray imaging , including asymptomatic infection , mild , moderate , severe and critical cases . The diagnostic criteria were as follows : 8 by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics 1 . Asymptomatic infection : without any clinical symptoms and signs and the chest imaging is normal , while the 2019 - nCoV nucleic acid test is in a positive period . 2 . Mild : symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection , including fever , fatigue , myalgia , cough , sore throat , runny nose , and sneezing . Physical examination shows congestion of the pharynx and no auscultory abnormalities . Some cases may have no fever , or have only digestive symptoms such as nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain and diarrhea . 3 . Moderate : with pneumonia , frequent fever and cough , mostly dry cough , followed by productive cough , some may have wheezing , but no obvious hypoxemia such as shortness of breath , and lungs can hear sputum or dry snoring and / or wet snoring . Some cases may have no clinical signs and symptoms , but chest CT shows lung lesions , which are subclinical . 4 . Severe : Early respiratory symptoms such as fever and cough , may be accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea . The disease usually progresses around 1 week , and dyspnea occurs , with central cyanosis . Oxygen saturation is less than 92 % , with other hypoxia manifestations . 5 . Critical : Children can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) or respiratory failure , and may also have shock , encephalopathy , myocardial injury or heart failure , coagulation dysfunction , and acute kidney injury . Organ dysfunction can be life threatening . Both the laboratory - confirmed and suspected cases were included in the analysis . The datasets were extracted from the electronic master database at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( China CDC ) . Data were entered into a computer and secured with a by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics password at Shanghai Children’s Medical Center . Cross - check and data cleaning was performed before the data analysis . Statistical Analysis We firstly described case characteristics , including age , sex , dates of disease onset and diagnosis , and location where the case was notified . Chi - square tests and Fisher’s exact tests were used for categorical variables as appropriate and Mann - Whitney U test was used for comparing median values of non - normally distributed variables . The epidemic curves were constructed by key dates of disease onset , and case diagnosis . Due to the data unavailability ( i . e . , no detailed exposure data ) , we were unable to estimate the incubation period . Onset - to - diagnosis curves were constructed by fitting a log - normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates . All analyses were conducted with the use of Statistical Product and Service Solutions ( SPSS 22 . 0 ) software and distribution maps were plotted using ArcGIS version 10 . 2 . Ethics Due to the nature of aggregated data and the ongoing public health response to control the outbreak , as well as the importance of sharing the research findings and bridging the knowledge gaps , an ethical approval was considered to be waived by institutional review board . Results By Feb 8 , 2020 , 2143 pediatric patients with COVID - 19 were reported to China CDC ( Table 1 ) . Of them , 731 ( 34 . 1 % ) patients were identified as laboratory - confirmed cases , and by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics 1412 ( 65 . 9 % ) were suspected cases . The median age of all patients was 7 years ( Interquartile range : 2 - 13 ) . Among those patients , 1213 cases ( 56 . 6 % ) were boys and there was no statistically significant difference in the number of pediatric patients between boys and girls . For the severity of patients ( including both confirmed and suspected cases ) , 94 ( 4 . 4 % ) , 1091 ( 50 . 9 % ) and 831 ( 38 . 8 % ) patients were diagnosed as asymptomatic , mild or moderate cases , respectively , totally accounted for 94 . 1 % of all cases . About a half of patients were from Hubei province ( 984 , 45 . 9 % ) , while 397 ( 18 . 5 % ) cases were from Anhui , Henan , Hunan , Jiangxi , Shanxi and Chongqing which border Hubei province . Table 2 shows the severity of illness by age and it reveals that young children , particularly infants , were vulnerable to 2019 - nCoV infection . The proportion of severe and critical cases was 10 . 6 % , 7 . 3 % , 4 . 2 % , 4 . 1 % and 3 . 0 % for the age group of < 1 , 1 - 5 , 6 - 10 , 11 - 15 and ≥ 16 years , respectively . Besides , a 14 - year - old boy from Hubei province died on Feb 7 , 2020 . In the temporal distribution , among the 2143 pediatric patients , there was a trend of the rapid increase of disease onset in the early stage of the epidemic , and then , a gradual and steady decrease ( Fig 1 ) . The total number of pediatric patients increased remarkably between mid - January and early February , peaked around Feb 1 , and then declined since early February 2020 . The number of diagnoses had been rising every day from January 20 when the first case was diagnosed . Similar trends of onset and diagnoses were found in confirmed ( Fig 2 & Fig 3 ) and suspected cases ( Supplementary Fig 1 & Fig 2 ) . The earliest date of illness onset was Dec 26 , 2019 , while the earliest date of diagnoses was Jan 20 , 2020 . The median days from illness onset to diagnoses was 2 days ( range : 0 to 42 days ) . Fig 4 shows that most cases were diagnosed in the 1 st week after illness onset occurred . by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics In the spatial distribution , there was a clear trend that disease rapidly spread from Hubei Province to surrounding provinces and cities over time . There were more children infected in the areas around Hubei province than areas farther away except for Heilongjiang Province ( Fig 5 ) . Discussion To the best of our knowledge , this is the first retrospective study on the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics of children’s COVID - 19 in China . As most of these children were likely to expose themselves to family members and / or other children with COVID - 19 , it clearly indicates person - to - person transmission . Supportive evidence of such a transmission pathway has also been reported from studies on adult patients . 10 - 12 As of 8 February 2020 , of the 2143 pediatric patients included in this study , only one child died and most cases were mild , with much fewer severe and critical cases ( 5 . 9 % ) than adult patients ( 18 . 5 % ) . 13 It suggests that , compared with adult patients , clinical manifestations of children’s COVID - 19 may be less severe . Coronaviruses are large , enveloped , positive strand RNA viruses that can be divided into 4 genera : alpha , beta , delta , and gamma , of which alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans , which is called human coronaviruses ( HCoVs ) . 14 Four HCoVs ( HCoV 229E , NL63 , OC43 , and HKU1 ) are endemic globally and account for 10 % to 30 % of upper respiratory tract infections in adults . 15 Although HCoVs have long been regarded inconsequential pathogens due to their mild phenotypes in humans , in the early 21 st century , two large - scale epidemics with alarming morbidity and mortality – i . e . , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) , have changed that view . by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics During December 2019 - February 2020 ( when the paper is writing ) , 2019 - nCoV , another highly pathogenic HCoV , has caused tens of thousands of illnesses and over 2000 deaths . 16 The epidemic is ongoing and rapidly evolving , and the ultimate scope and impact of this event is still unclear . Genomic analyses suggest that the 2019 - nCoV may originally come from bats , because of the similarity of its genetic sequence to those of other known coronaviruses , but the pathogen was probably transmitted to humans by other animals which may serve as intermediate hosts , facilitating recombination and mutation events with expansion of genetic diversity . 3 - 5 On 7 February 2020 , researchers in Guangzhou , China , identified the pangolin as one of the potential sources of 2019 - nCoV on the basis of a genetic comparison of CoVs in the samples taken from the animals and from humans infected in the outbreak and other findings . 17 , 18 Genetic sequences of viruses isolated from the scaly animals are 99 % similar to that of the circulating virus . Why most of the children’s COVID - 19 cases were less severe than adults’ cases is puzzling . This may be related to both exposure and host factors . Children were usually well cared for at home and might have relatively less opportunities to expose themselves to pathogens and / or sick patients . Angiotensin converting enzyme II ( ACE2 ) was known as cell receptor for SARS - CoV . 19 2019 - nCoV has some amino acid homology to SARS - CoV and may be able to use ACE2 as a receptor . Recent evidence indicates that ACE2 is also likely the cell receptor of 2019 - nCoV . 20 , 21 It is speculated that children were less sensitive to 2019 - nCoV because the maturity and function ( e . g . , binding ability ) of ACE2 in children may be lower than that in adults . 22 Additionally , children often experience respiratory infections ( e . g . , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) ) in winter , and may have higher levels of antibody against virus than adults . Furthermore , by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics children’s immune system is still developing , and may respond to pathogens differently to adults . However , we found that the proportion of severe and critical cases was 10 . 6 % , 7 . 3 % , 4 . 2 % , 4 . 1 % and 3 . 0 % for the age group of ˂ 1 , 1 - 5 , 6 - 10 , 11 - 15 and > 15 years , respectively . These results suggest that young children , particularly infants , were vulnerable to 2019 - nCoV infection . Therefore , the mechanisms for the difference in clinical manifestations between children and adults remain to be determined . There were more severe and critical cases in the suspected than confirmed category in this study . However , it remains to be determined whether these severe and critical cases in the suspected group were caused by 2019 - nCoV or other pathogens ( e . g . , RSV ) . It may become clearer as the epidemic is quickly unfolding . We observed slightly more boys than girls ( 56 . 6 % vs 43 . 4 % ) affected in the COVID - 19 outbreak , which is similar to the two recent epidemiological studies . 13 , 23 However , no significant gender difference was observed in this study . The median age of all children’s COVID - 19 cases was 7 years ( Interquartile range : 11 ) , but it ranged from 1 day to 18 years . It suggests that all ages at childhood were susceptible to 2019 - nCoV . Temporal distribution of children’s COVID - 19 cases shows that , in the early stage of the epidemic ( i . e . , between Dec . , 2019 and early Feb . , 2020 ) , there was a trend of the rapid increase of disease onset . Since early February 2020 , the number of children’s COVID - 19 cases has been declining . It indicates that the disease control measures implemented by the government were effective , and it is likely that this epidemic will continue to decline , and finally stop in the near future unless sustained human - to - human transmissions occur . Most of the children’s COVID - 19 cases concentrated in Wuhan , but spread to other areas of Hubei province and further to other by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics areas of China . It seems that the closer to Wuhan , the more cases in that area , which suggests that population mobility is an important factor for the spread of 2019 - nCoV . Heilongjiang province is an exception , which may be because many visitors went there , including those from Wuhan , due to the Ice Sculpture Festival in Harbin , the provincial capital . This study has several strengths . First , this is the first nationwide study , to date , with a major focus on the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics of children’s COVID - 19 in China . It shows that , compared with the adults’ cases , the severity of children’s COVID - 19 cases was milder , and the case fatality rate was much lower . 13 , 23 Second , the large number of children’s COVID - 19 cases enabled us to conduct detailed stratified analyses on sex , age , and spatiotemporal distribution . Finally , we included both confirmed and suspected COVID - 19 cases , and it may reveal a comprehensive picture of pediatric patients with COVID - 19 in China . This study also has a number of limitations . First , we were unable to assess clinical characteristics of children’s COVID - 19 as these data were unavailable at the time of analysis . As an important and urgent issue , clinical features of children’s COVID - 19 need to be analyzed in further research . It appeared to have more severe and critical cases in the suspected than confirmed group ( Table 1 ) , which suggests that some suspected cases might be caused by other respiratory infections ( e . g . , RSV ) . Second , we did not have information on children’s exposure history , and thus , the incubation period was not examined in this study . Finally , since the epidemic of COVID - 19 is on - going and rapidly evolving , many children affected still remain hospitalized . To gain a better understanding of children’s COVID - 19 , more detailed patient information , particularly clinical outcomes ( e . g . , discharge , transferred to intensive care unit , or death ) , should be collected in future studies . by guest on March 16 , 2020 www . aappublications . org / news Downloaded from Pre - publication Release ©2020 American Academy of Pediatrics Conclusions Children at all ages were sensitive to COVID - 19 , and there was no significant gender difference . Clinical manifestations of children’s COVID - 19 cases were less severe than those of adults’ patients . However , young children , particularly infants , were vulnerable to 2019 - nCoV infection . The distribution of children’s COVID - 19 cases varied with time and space , and most of the cases concentrated in Wuhan and surrounding areas . Furthermore , the results of this study provide strong evidence for human - to - human transmission as children were unlikely to visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market where the early adult patients were reported to obtain 2019 - nCoV .
