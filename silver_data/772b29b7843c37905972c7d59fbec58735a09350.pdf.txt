These domains are characterized by their strong ability to transform globular liposomes as well as flat plasma membranes into elongated membrane tubules both in vitro and in vivo . Biochemical studies on the structures of these proteins have revealed the importance of the amphipathic helix , which potentially intercalates into the lipid bilayer to induce and / or sense membrane curvature . Among such membrane - deforming domains , BAR and F - BAR / EFC domains form crescent - shaped dimers , suggesting a preference for a curved membrane , which is important for curvature sensing . Bioinformatics in combination with structural analyses has been identifying an increasing number of novel families of lipid - binding domains . This review attempts to summarize the evidence obtained by recent studies in order to gain general insights into the roles of membrane - deforming domains in a variety of biological events .

Introduction Cellular membranes have unique shapes that are defined by various factors including different lipid compositions between leaflets , cross - linked transmembrane protein , pulling or protruding force by the cytoskeleton ( and associated motors ) , and scaffolding effects by cytosolic coat proteins [ 1 , 2 ] . Intracellular membrane traffic is initiated by vesicle formation in which dynamic shape change of the membrane takes place . Namely , it is a sequential process of ―budding , ‖ where the flat membrane is deformed to an invaginated dome ; ―vesicle growth , ‖ where the invaginated membrane becomes a globular vesicle by narrowing its neck ; and ―fission , ‖ where mechanical forces by associated protein ( s ) pinch off the membrane neck to complete vesicle formation . Recent findings have revealed an increasing number of cytosolic proteins that actively control the shape of the membrane at every stage of this process . A notable feature of such proteins is their intrinsic ability to transform globular liposomes into long and narrow membrane tubules [ 3 - 6 ] . Two types of proteins induce membrane tubulation . One is mediated by the overall protein structure as exemplified by dynamin , a membrane - associated GTPase essential for the tubulation and fission steps of endocytosis [ 7 - 9 ] . The other is achieved solely by part of a protein , structurally defined as a ―domain . ‖ A growing number of ―membrane - tubulating domains‖ shared by various proteins implicated in membrane trafficking have been emerging . In this review , we start by describing the BAR domain , the first of the membrane - tubulating domains reported . Recent findings have further extended this particular domain family by including structurally identified new members such as Arfaptin , sorting nexins , and FCH - domain - containing F - BAR / EFC domains . We then discuss the role of ENTH domains , another membrane - deforming domain family involved in the early onset of endocytosis . Finally , we describe the new concept for membrane deformation or curvature sensing by ALPS motifs or tandem C2 domains . Structural studies on these domain families have started to dissect the mechanism by which an interaction with lipid molecules in the bilayer eventually bends the membrane . We aim to present an emerging picture of the cellular membrane whose shape is dynamically controlled by membrane - deforming domains in a wide range of cellular events such as endocytosis , exocytosis , and cytoskeletal regulation . 2 . BAR domain 2 . 1 . BAR domain is a membrane - tubulating module The BAR domain was originally found as an N - terminal region highly conserved in mammalian and yeast amphiphysins , and is thus named after these proteins ( Bin1 , amphiphysin , and Rvs161 / 167p ) . In yeast , RVS161 and RVS167 genes are essential for cell viability and BAR domains are required to suppress the mutant phenotype [ 10 ] . Initially , the biochemical role of the BAR domain was thought to be a heterodimerizaton or homodimerization interface of amphiphysin or endophilin [ 11 - 13 ] . Consistently , the secondary structure of this domain was predicted to be highly  - helical and to even form a coiled - coil structure . Despite these findings , together with the fact that amphiphysin and endophilin are involved in clathrin - dependent endocytosis by forming a complex with dynamin or synaptojanin [ 14 - 16 ] , the exact role of the BAR domain was unclear . The understanding of the BAR domain as a membrane - bending module comes from the context of its binding partner—dynamin . Dynamin has a strong ability to deform liposomes into membrane tubules , in vitro , on which it polymerizes with a characteristic striation pattern [ 5 , 6 ] . When pre - incubated with amphiphysin , the dynamin – amphiphysin complex shows a wider striation , indicating a hybrid coat on the tubule generated by both proteins [ 4 ] . Surprisingly , amphiphysin by itself has the ability to induce membrane tubulation with a diameter of similar range to that of dynamin - induced tubules [ 4 ] . Deletion experiments have identified the N - terminal 284 amino acids to be the region sufficient for this tubulation activity , corresponding to the BAR domain of amphiphysin . Subsequently , similar membrane - tubulating activity was found in another major dynamin - binding protein—endophilin [ 3 ] . A careful search of the amphiphysin and endophilin sequences identified a highly homologous region of 30 amino acids at the N - termini of both proteins . Helical wheel modeling of this region revealed an amphipathic property , in which hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues align on the opposite sides of the helix , respectively [ 3 ] . One of the hydrophobic amino acids in this helix , Phe10 , was shown to be essential for tubulation when a point mutant of this residue , F10E , lost its activity [ 3 ] . This hydrophobicity in the amphipathic helix is believed to be important for membrane curvature formation by penetrating into the lipid bilayer , expanding the surface area of the cytosolic leaflet . This eventually led to an interpretation of the mechanism by which the epsin ENTH domain deforms the plasma membrane at the onset of clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 17 ] , as discussed later . An immunofluorescent study of the muscle - specific isoform of amphiphysin2 ( M - amph2 ) revealed a T - tubule structure in skeletal muscle [ 18 ] . In Drosophila , amphiphysin was also shown to localize at the T - tubule , and the disruption of amph gene resulted in an abnormal structure and function of the T - tubule / sarcoplasmic reticulum system [ 19 ] . Consistently , overexpression of M - amph2 in CHO cells resulted in a robust membrane tubulation invaginated from the plasma membrane [ 20 ] , indicating its direct role in the formation and maintenance of the T - tubule network . 2 . 2 . Structure of BAR domain—a banana - shaped dimer The crystal structure of the BAR domain of Drosophila amphiphysin ( dAmph ) as well as mammalian endophilin has been solved [ 21 - 24 ] . It consists of three long helices with no strands , forming a dimer at a certain angle with each other . This angled association and the kinked shape of helices 2 and 3 make the dimer resemble a banana . Electrostatic surface modeling revealed that positively charged amino acids , such as K137 and R140 as well as K161 and K163 , were located at the concave surface of the dAmph BAR dimer . Point mutants of these positive residues resulted in a loss of membrane binding as well as tubulation activity . These findings indicate that the concave surface of the banana attaches onto the membrane and also suggest that the banana - like structure is suitable for interaction with the curved membrane . The diameter of the best - fitted membrane tubules or vesicles was calculated to be 22 nm [ 21 ] , consistent with that of the dynamin - induced tubular membrane neck [ 25 ] . A curvature - dependent membrane binding was shown for the amphiphysin BAR domain , which preferably co - sedimented with 50 - nm - sized liposomes but not with larger ones [ 21 ] . 2 . 3 . Growing family of the BAR domain The preceding study helped highlight the structural neighbors of the dAmph BAR domain [ 21 ] . The most striking similarity was found in the Arfaptin structure , an Arf - and Rac - binding protein previously implicated in Golgi functions and actin cytoskeleton regulation [ 26 , 27 ] . Intensive database searches of distantly related sequences unveiled vast numbers of proteins of this family [ 21 , 28 ] , including centaurins ( Arf GAPs ) , oligophrenins ( Rho GAPs ) , and sorting nexins ( PX domain - containing proteins ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Similar to the dAmph BAR domain , Arfaptin bound and even tubulated liposomes when incubated at higher concentrations [ 21 ] . Newly found BAR domains of centaurin , oligophrenin , and sorting nexin also preferred high curvature in membrane binding [ 21 , 29 , 30 ] , indicating that curvature sensing is an evolutionarily conserved property of the BAR domain . 3 . F - BAR / EFC domain 3 . 1 . F - BAR / EFC domain , a novel BAR - related domain A two - hybrid screen identified a protein that binds to the active form of Cdc42 , a Rho subfamily of small GTPase [ 31 ] . This protein , named CIP4 ( Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ) , had an N - terminal region highly conserved in several other proteins such as tyrosine kinase Fes and Fer , SH3 - containing protein syndapin / PACSIN , and Rho GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) WRP / srGAPs [ 32 - 38 ] ; thus , it was named the FCH domain ( for FER – CIP4 homology ) [ 31 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . Fer tyrosine kinase is known to participate in the regulation of cell – cell adhesion through interaction with p120 - catenin [ 39 , 40 ] . Syndapin1 was initially identified as a dynamin - binding protein [ 35 ] and was found to be involved in endocytosis [ 41 ] . It also binds to N - WASP , an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex , to coordinate the actin functions in endocytosis [ 42 ] . WRP was identified as a binding protein for WAVE1 , another Arp2 / 3 activator family member related to N - WASP [ 33 ] , and srGAP1 is a Cdc42 GAP involved in the slit - robo pathway , which controls neuronal migration [ 36 ] . The FCH domain is also found in yeast proteins such as Cyk2p / Hof1p , Bzz1p , and Rgd1 - 2p in budding yeast , and Cdc15p , Imp2p , YB65 ( pombe Bzz1p ) , and Rga7 - 9p in fission yeast ( Fig . 2 ) [ 43 - 49 ] . Most of these are functionally linked to actin polymerization and cytokinesis . All these findings strongly support the view that FCH proteins are involved in the cellular events dependent on the actin cytoskeleton and its regulatory machinery . 3 . 2 . Membrane - tubulating activity of F - BAR / EFC domain When overexpressed in the cell , some of the FCH - containing proteins induced , and localized at , a filamentous structure seemingly reminiscent of the microtubule [ 50 - 52 ] . Dual - color immunofluorescence studies clearly demonstrated that this structure did not overlap any cytoskeleton ( microtubules , F - actin , or intermediate filament ) . Interestingly , it was connected to the outer space and thus represented an invaginated plasma membrane [ 53 ] , similar to the membrane tubules induced by the overexpression of M - amph2 [ 20 ] . The membrane - tubulating activity of FBP17 was directly demonstrated by incubating its recombinant protein with liposomes [ 54 ] . A secondary structure prediction anticipated a larger structure composed of three long  - helices , covering the FCH domain up to the following coiled - coil region , which is always found at the C - terminal side of almost all FCH domains . This means that the conventionally defined FCH domain is only part of a larger domain—the F - BAR / EFC domain ( F - BAR for FCH and BAR , and EFC for extended FCH ) [ 54 , 55 ] . Many of the F - BAR / EFC - domain - containing proteins also have at their C - termini SH3 domains that bind to dynamin . FBP17 and CIP4 not only induced robust membrane tubulation when overexpressed , but also recruited dynamin onto these tubules [ 25 , 53 , 54 ] . Treatment with LatrunculinB , a blocking agent of actin polymerization , enhanced the growth of membrane tubules [ 54 ] . This effect was found to be reversible as wash out of the drug promoted fission of tubules into small vesicles [ 54 ] . These results suggest a close interplay between the F - BAR / EFC - induced membrane tubulation and actin cytoskeleton by which dynamin – FBP17 / CIP4 complexes could utilize the actin cytoskeleton for fission at the vesicular neck in endocytosis . 3 . 3 . Structure of the F - BAR / EFC domain The crystal structure of the F - BAR / EFC domains from FBP17 , CIP4 , and FCHo2 comprises six - helix bundles , which also form banana - shaped dimers as formed by BAR domains [ 56 , 57 ] . They also have conserved basic patches on their concave surfaces to interact with acidic lipids . A marked difference from the BAR domain structure is that the curvature is much shallower , making the F - BAR / EFC structure fit the membrane surface with diameter of ~ 60 nm . When viewed from the convex face , the dimer forms a tilde ( ~ ) shape , which is suitable for lateral interactions [ 57 ] . This lateral interaction involves several hydrophobic and charge interactions between monomers , believed to ―coat‖ the surface of the membrane tubule and provide it with some rigidity [ 58 , 59 ] . Another feature of the F - BAR / EFC structure is the ―tip - to - tip‖ interaction , which is believed to be important for the formation of filamentous structures surrounding the membrane tubule [ 54 , 56 ] . However , this mode of interaction seems to be canceled out when narrower tubules are formed [ 58 ] , indicating a regulatory mechanism of tubule diameter by controlling the tip - to - tip interactions . 4 . ENTH domain 4 . 1 . ENTH domain in clathrin - dependent endocytosis and actin function A 94 kDa protein was identified as a major binding partner of the EH domain of Eps15 , an important regulatory protein in endocytosis [ 60 ] . This protein , named epsin ( after Eps15 - interacting protein ) , had NPF motifs at its C - terminal region , consistent with its strong binding affinity for EH domains [ 60 , 61 ] . In addition , epsin also contained DPW motifs at its central region that bind to the appendage domain of  - adaptin , a subunit of the AP - 2 complex [ 60 , 61 ] , as well as clathrin - binding motifs that bind to the terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain [ 62 , 63 ] , indicating its function as an adaptor in the formation of endocytic machinery complex . Besides these short peptide motifs at the center of the C - terminal region , the N - terminal ~ 180 amino acids were anticipated to form a globular structure evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammal [ 60 , 64 ] —the ENTH domain ( for epsin N - terminal homology ) . The ENTH domain is mainly found in epsin family members such as mammalian epsin1 - 3 , epsinR , and budding yeast proteins Ent1 - 5p . Yeast genetics has indicated an essential role for the ENTH domain of Ent1p and Ent2p , two of at least five epsin homologs in budding yeast [ 65 ] . Double deletion of both ENT1 and ENT2 genes resulted in a lethal phenotype , concomitant with an aberrant actin structure and growth arrest . Exogenous expression of either gene in this double - mutant cell suppressed these phenotypes , although ENTH - domain - deleted forms could not . Furthermore , an error - prone PCR approach , which introduces random point mutations in the ENT1 and ENT2 genes , identified eight of nine mutations in the ENTH domain that failed to reverse the ent1 / 2 double - deletion phenotype [ 65 ] , indicating an essential role of this domain in epsin function . 4 . 2 . ENTH domain binds phosphoinositides At the molecular level , an explanation for the role of the ENTH domain was provided by the finding that the epsin 1 ENTH domain interacts with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a phosphoinositide mainly localized at the plasma membrane [ 66 ] . Overexpression of epsin 1 K76A , which lost the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding affinity of ENTH , as well as that of epsin 1  ENTH , in which the entire ENTH domain was deleted , efficiently blocked EGF internalization [ 66 , 67 ] . This finding indicated an essential role of the ENTH – PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction in endocytosis . It also provided important information about the molecular mechanism of endocytosis that occurs at the plasma membrane , where PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 acts as a key regulator in recruiting endocytic machinery under the control of phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes such as PIP 5 - kinases ( PIP5K I  ) and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatases ( synaptojanin ) [ 68 - 70 ] . EpsinR ( also called enthoprotin or Clint ) is a unique member of the epsin family in that it only shares with other epsin members an ENTH domain and clathrin - binding motifs but not DPW or NPF motifs [ 71 - 74 ] . Instead , it binds through its DFxDW / F motifs to the  - ear domain of AP - 1 , an adaptor complex implicated in vesicular trafficking from the Golgi membrane . Knockdown experiments demonstrated that epsinR is required for retrograde transport of Shiga toxin , TGN38 / 46 , and mannose 6 - phosphate receptor from the early and / or recycling endosomes to the trans - Golgi network [ 75 ] . The ENTH domain of epsinR was also found to bind phosphoinositides , with the highest affinity for PI4P [ 73 , 74 ] . This preference seems consistent with the established function of PI4P on the Golgi membrane , where it recruits effector proteins such as AP - 1 and FAPP1 PH domain for the budding of cargo - containing vesicles [ 76 , 77 ] . Different specificities in phosphoinositide binding were reported for the ENTH domains of yeast epsin Ent1 - 5p . The Ent1p ENTH domain shows a broad specificity for most of the phosphoinositides and other acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylserine [ 78 ] . On the contrary , the ENTH domain of Ent3p , as well as Ent5p , binds almost exclusively to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 [ 79 - 81 ] ; this interaction is thought to mediate protein transport into the multivesicular body ( MVB ) but not endocytosis at the plasma membrane . The study by Wendland et al . [ 65 ] demonstrated that although ENT1 and ENT2 genes are mutually redundant , the ent1 / ent2 double mutant showed a lethal phenotype , indicating their distinct roles from those of other ENT genes such as ENT3 or ENT5 . This distinction may , at least in part , be explained by the difference in phosphoinositide - binding specificities of ENTH domains between Ent1 / 2p and Ent3 / 5p . 4 . 3 . Structure of ENTH domain and membrane deformation Both the crystal and NMR structures of the epsin ENTH domain were solved [ 66 , 82 , 83 ] and revealed to consist only of  - helices . The N - terminal 14 residues were not ordered in both studies , indicating their labile structural nature in solution . Comparisons of chemical shift values in the absence or the presence of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , the head group of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , manifested a large structural change at the N - terminal region upon phosphoinositide binding [ 66 ] . In fact , deletion of N - terminal 18 residues , as well as alanine substitution of Arg8 in this region , abolished phosphoinositide binding [ 66 ] . These results clearly indicated the key role of the N - terminal region in lipid binding , which was subsequently supported by the crystal structure of the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - bound state of the epsin ENTH domain [ 17 ] . The results revealed that the N - terminal region actually forms an extra  - helix ( helix 0 ) , forming a concave surface where positively charged residues such as R63 and H73 are coordinated with the phosphates of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . More interestingly , helix 0 also retained an amphipathic property , as had been proposed for BAR domains [ 3 ] . Consistently , the epsin ENTH domain can also change the shape of liposomes into tubules [ 17 ] , in a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent manner on the liposome . A hydrophobic residue , Leu6 , is not only located at the putative membrane - embedded side of the helix but was also shown to be necessary for tubulation . The tubulating activity of ENTH is believed to reflect its ability to deform a flat plasma membrane into an invaginated membrane at the onset of endocytosis , as observed for invaginated clathrin - coated pits reconstituted on a lipid monolayer in vitro [ 17 ] . This idea was supported by the consideration that in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , the rigidity of the clathrin triskelion is not sufficiently high to bend the flat membrane and thus needs an additional force ( by the epsin ENTH domain ) for membrane deformation [ 84 , 85 ] . 5 . Two faces of amphipathic helix 5 . 1 . Amphipathic helix as a curvature driver As has been discussed for both the BAR and ENTH domains , the key structural factor for membrane deformation is the presence of the amphipathic helix ( Fig . 3A ) . An amphipathic helix is formed in the epsin ENTH domain structure only when bound to Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 [ 17 ] . On study found that the N - terminal region of the dAmph BAR domain was not ordered in the crystal structure [ 21 ] , probably because the protein was not in association with its ligand , phospholipids . However , circular dichroism spectra indicated that there is significant increase in  - helicity in the BAR structures of both dAmph and rat endophilin [ 21 , 23 ] . Furthermore , specific spin labeling and subsequent electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the N - terminal region indeed becomes ordered upon lipid binding [ 23 ] . Further , the amphipathic helix is also utilized by small GTPases involved in other membrane - deforming processes . Arf1 is a small GTPase that controls the budding and uncoating cycle of the COPI coat at the Golgi membrane . In its GDP - bound state , N - terminal 17 amino acids apply a helical conformation at the central core of the protein , and then become exposed upon GTP binding [ 86 - 88 ] . The same structural transition was observed for Sar1 , which controls the COPII coat assembly [ 89 ] . Interestingly , N - terminal helices of both GTPases retain amphipathic properties and were also shown to be necessary for membrane binding . In fact , Arf1 as well as Sar1 can tubulate liposomes in vitro , and the hydrophobic residues in the N - terminal helices were important [ 90 - 93 ] . 5 . 2 . Amphipathic helix as a curvature sensor—ALPS motifs The banana - shaped dimer is not the sole structure that could be a curvature sensor . ArfGAP1 , which negatively regulates Arf GTPase and is thus involved in coatomer disassembly after the formation of the cargo - containing vesicle , is activated by diacylglycerol . Interestingly , the lipid with unsaturated carboxyl chains was most efficient in activating ArfGAP1 [ 94 ] . In theory , unsaturated lipids are less packed and therefore provide a larger space in the bilayer into which membrane - binding proteins can penetrate . This is highly reminiscent of the situation at the surface of the highly curved membrane , which resulted in smaller vesicles . Indeed , ArfGAP1 activation was shown to depend on liposome size ; that is , the degree of membrane curvature [ 95 ] . The minimal region responsible for this curvature dependency was identified to be the central 40 amino acids with amphipathic property when modeled as a helix , called the ALPS motif for ArfGAP1 lipid - packing sensor [ 96 ] . Circular dichroism spectra showed that the ALPS motif actually forms a helical structure only when bound to the membrane [ 96 ] . These findings collectively indicate that the amphipathic helix could be another mechanism of curvature sensing ( Fig . 3B ) . In a database search utilizing an algorithm that specifically picks up amphipathic peptide sequences , Drin et al . [ 97 ] found a large number of potential ALPS motifs . Among such candidates , including the sterol transporter Kes1p and nucleoporin Nup13 , the team further demonstrated a membrane - tethering ability of golgin GMAP - 210 in a manner dependent on vesicular size [ 98 ] . 6 . Curvature toward the extracellular space The topology of membrane bending is also an interesting question to be explored . In the cell , there could be two types of membrane deformations : invagination and evagination . Most of the membrane - tubulating domains identified so far concern membrane invagination , where positive curvature is generated on the side protein attachments , exemplified by endocytosis from the plasma membrane or vesicular budding from the organellar membrane . By contrast , evagination is a process in which positive curvature is formed on the opposite side of the cytosol , which eventually pushes the membrane toward the outside of the cell or the inner space of organelles . This ―reverse deformation‖ is typically observed in several important cellular events including cell movement , which is accompanied by ―pushing‖ of the plasma membrane . 6 . 1 . I - BAR domain in membrane evagination A branch of the BAR domain family is characterized by a structure that is not a banana - like dimer rather straight and more like a zeppelin . This subfamily , called the I - BAR domain for inverse BAR or IMD after the names of representative proteins such as IRSp53 and MIM [ 99 , 100 ] , induces robust plasma membrane protrusion when overexpressed in various cell types [ 101 , 102 ] . More interestingly , the I - BAR domain is able to reproduce such membrane protrusion when incubated with liposomes in vitro , resulting in the formation of a tubular membrane elongating toward the inner space of globular liposomes [ 103 ] . This may be mediated by the highly conserved positively charged residues located at the extreme ends of the I - BAR structure that simultaneously interacts with Rac GTPase and the membrane [ 102 ] . The combination of this type of membrane - deforming and actin - polymerizing activities seems to be important for the pushing force of the plasma membrane during cell migration . 6 . 2 . Snf7 , a new player for membrane evagination through circular array of filamentous structures Another group for membrane evagination , which is more vesicular , has been observed in viral budding or MVB formation . Although studies had revealed the involvement of several molecules such as ESCRT proteins , little was known about the mechanism of the membrane evagination process because of the lack of information on their membrane interaction properties . Recently , a study utilizing electron microscopy has revealed a novel mode of membrane evagination by one of the components of the ESCRT - III complex—hSnf7 [ 104 ] . Also called CHMP4 , hSnf7 is localized both at endosomes and the plasma membrane when overexpressed . Visualizing the inner surface of the plasma membrane of the expressing cell by ―deep etch‖ electron microscopy , it was found that a filamentous structure aligns in a circular pattern . More interestingly , when co - expressed with a mutant form of Vps4 , an ATPase involved in disassembly of the ESCRT - III complex , hSnf7 filaments form thicker bundles and apparently push the plasma membrane outward , resulting in a tubular protrusion of the plasma membrane [ 104 ] . This finding is quite important because it has provided the first evidence for membrane protrusion toward the outer space of the cytosol , simultaneously corresponding to the inner space of organelles , which may drive the formation of inner vesicles of MVB . 7 . Tandem C2 domains in membrane bending and fusion Membrane fusion takes place during a variety of physiological events such as synaptic transmission , myotube differentiation , and viral entry . It is believed to occur through the state of ―hemifusion‖ in which each outer leaflet of opposing lipid bilayer is intermixed . To achieve hemifusion , the high - energy barrier must be overcome by membrane - bending forces , which may pull lipid molecules out of the opposing outer leaflet . Such activity was reported for synaptotagmin , a transmembrane protein localized at the synaptic vesicle with tandem C2 domains , a Ca 2 + - dependent lipid - binding module . When the tandem C2 domains of synaptotagmin I was incubated with liposomes in the presence of Ca 2 + , membrane tubules with very small diameter ( ~ 17 nm ) were induced [ 105 ] . This activity was not observed if the two C2 domains were structurally separated , indicating that changes in their steric state upon Ca 2 + binding is important . Considering the large number of proteins containing tandem or multiple C2 - domain - containing proteins , this mode of membrane deformation will potentially be found in wider range of physiological events . 8 . Conclusion Recent findings about novel interactions between proteins and lipids have revealed a more dynamic picture of cellular membrane based on the powerful tubulating and / or deforming activity inherent to a special group of lipid - binding domain . The domain species described in this review would be just a fraction of a more diverse family of domains that control and / or recognize the shape of the membrane . More careful reexamination of already known lipid - binding domains , as well as extensive search for novel domains , seems necessary to precisely understand the mechanism of membrane dynamics in the cell . This new paradigm proposed for protein – lipid interactions is clearly at the dawn of an explosive growth in cell biology . To obtain a sound basis for this new concept , a much comprehensive approach will be necessary . Acknowledgement We are grateful to Dr . Masahiro Nishijima for encouraging us to write this review .

Figure 3 Mechanisms of curvature - generation and - sensing ( A ) Amphipathic helix in a protein ( depicted as a ―wedge‖ - like structure ) can penetrate into the lipid bilayer , increasing the surface area of the inner leaflet ( upper side of the bilayer ) thus inducing curvature . ( B ) Different membrane curvatures could be sensed by amphipathic helices ( upper ) or banana - shaped dimers ( lower ) . The difference of the sensed curvature would be attributed to the volumes of the helices that could penetrate into the bilayer , or the depths of the concave surface of banana that interacts with the membrane .
