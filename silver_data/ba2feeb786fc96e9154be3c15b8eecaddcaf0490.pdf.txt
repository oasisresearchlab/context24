Using Aspergillus nidulans , we show that AP - 2 has a clathrin - independent essential role in polarity maintenance and growth . This is in line with a sequence analysis showing that the AP - 2 b subunit ( b 2 ) of higher fungi lacks a clathrin - binding domain , and experiments showing that AP - 2 does not co - localize with clathrin . We provide genetic and cellular evidence that AP - 2 interacts with endocytic markers SlaB End4 and SagA End3 and the lipid flippases DnfA and DnfB in the sub - apical collar region of hyphae . The role of AP - 2 in the maintenance of proper apical membrane lipid and cell wall composition is further supported by its functional interaction with BasA ( sphingolipid biosynthesis ) and StoA ( apical sterol - rich membrane domains ) , and its essentiality in polar deposition of chitin . Our findings support that the AP - 2 complex of dikarya has acquired , in the course of evolution , a specialized clathrin - independent function necessary for fungal polar growth . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 . 001 Introduction The five distinct Adaptor Protein ( AP or adaptin ) complexes are heterotetrameric adaptors that recruit membrane cargoes and coat proteins during vesicle formation at various subcellular locations for membrane trafficking in eukaryotes ( Nakatsu and Ohno , 2003 ; Robinson , 2004 , 2015 ) . AP - 1 is necessary for the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles that traffic between the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and early endosomes . AP - 2 is involved in the formation of clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane ( PM ) . AP - 3 is involved in , apparently , clathrin - independent vesicle for - mation in the Golgi for traffic to endosomes and lysosomes or vacuoles . AP - 4 and AP - 5 seem to have more specialized roles in vesicle transport of specific cargoes from the TGN to endosomes and / or the cell surface ( Hirst et al . , 2013 ) . All AP complexes are composed of two different subunits of high molecular weight ~ 100 kDa ( called a , b or g adaptins ) , one subunit of medium size ( m , 47 – 50 kDa ) , and one low - molecular - weight subunit ( s , 17 – 19 kDa ) . The five AP complexes have been shown to have a wide eukaryote distribution , supporting that all were present in the Last Eukaryote Common Ancestor ( LECA ) ( Barlow et al . , 2014 ) . Noticeably , however , each AP complex , except AP - 1 , has been lost in various lineages . Fungi possess homologues of all AP - 1 , AP - 2 and AP - 3 subu - nits , but the great majority of them , have lost AP - 4 and AP - 5 . This loss concerns all Dikarya ( Ascomy - cetes and Basidiomycetes ) and most primitive fungi . AP - 4 or AP - 5 subunits are however present in the glomeromycete Rhizophagus irregularis and chytrid fungi Spizellomyces punctatus and Martzoukou et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e20083 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 1 of 26 RESEARCH ARTICLE Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , as well as , the sister group of all fungi , Fonticula alba . Notably , all eukaryotes studied possess clathrin , except for the Microsporidia intracellular parasites . Interestingly , the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi maintains AP subunits without having clathrin ( Barlow et al . , 2014 ) , suggesting an unknown clathrin - independent role of AP complexes . The role of the AP - 2 complex in clathrin - mediated endocytosis is well established in mammals . By contrast , its role in endocytosis in unicellular eukaryotes , such as the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevi - siae , Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida albicans has been questioned . An early systematic biochemical and genetic characterization of AP complexes in S . cerevisiae provided evidence that AP complexes are dispensable for clathrin function ( Yeung et al . , 1999 ) . Similarly , Huang et al . ( 1999 ) have shown that AP deletion strains did not display the phenotypes associated with clathrin deficiency , including slowed growth and endocytosis , defective late Golgi protein retention and impaired cytosol to vacuole / autophagy function . Subsequently however , AP - 2 has been localized to endocytic sites that are associated with clathrin , and have a cargo - specific function in killer toxin K28 endocytosis , making it likely that AP - 2 functions with clathrin ( Carroll et al . , 2009 , 2012 ) . Further - more , AP - 2 has been shown to be critical for hyphal growth in C . albicans and polarized cell responses in S . cerevisiae , and in particular to be necessary for relocalization of the cell wall stress sensor Mid2 to the tip of a mating projection following pheromone addition ( Chapa - y - Lazo et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , an interaction between the mu ( m ) subunit of AP - 2 and the cell wall integrity pathway component Pkc1 was reported to affect recruitment of the AP - 2 complex to endocytic sites ( Chapa - y - Lazo and Ayscough , 2014 ) . In another systematic screen to identify proteins required for cargo internalization , clathrin was shown to have a critical role for synaptobrevin homologue Snc1 endocytosis , but the role of AP - 2 was not investigated ( Burston et al . , 2009 ) . In a more recent study it has been shown that clathrin contributes to the regularity of vesicle scission and vesicle size , but is not required for elongating or shaping the endocytic membrane invagination , but again the role of AP - 2 was not studied ( Kukulski et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , in S . pombe , the AP - 2 a component ( Apl3p ) was shown to interact physically with clathrin light chain ( Clc1p ) , and genetically with both Clc1p and the endocytic factor Sla2p and additionally apl3 D null mutants showed altered dynamics of endocytic sites associated with abnormal cell wall synthesis and morphogenesis ( de Leo´n et al . , 2016 ; de Leo´n and Valdivieso , 2016 ) . The apparently moderate role of AP - 2 for growth in yeasts might reflect the fact that endocytosis in general is not essential for growth in unicellular fungi . In contrast to yeasts , the extreme polar growth of filamentous fungi , taking place by apical extension , is absolutely dependent on efficient and continuous endocytosis . Seminal studies on endocytosis and its relationship to growth have been performed in the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis ( Steinberg , 2014 ) and the ascomycete Asper - gillus nidulans ( Pen˜alva , 2010 ) , two emerging cell biology model systems . Two aspects of endocytosis have been studied in detail in A . nidulans . The first relates to the essential role of apical endocytosis in hyphal tube extension and polar growth ( Araujo - Baza´n et al . , 2008 ; Taheri - Talesh et al . , 2008 ; Hervas - Aguilar and Penalva , 2010 ; Pen˜alva , 2010 ) . It has been rigorously shown that polar growth maintenance is based on the spatial and functional coupling of rapid and continuous apical secretion and endocytosis in the hyphal tip region . Apically localized car - goes , as exemplified by the v - SNARE synaptobrevin homologue SynA , are internalized from a ‘collar’ region immediately below the hyphal tip and sorted in early endosomes ( EEs ) . EEs can mature into Late Endosomes ( LE ) or Multivesicular Bodies ( MVB ) and be sorted into vacuoles , or recycle back , apparently via the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) onto the PM . These post - endocytic trafficking pro - cesses taking place at the hyphal tips seem to be essential for the normal rate of secretion and proper growth . SlaB End4 and actin polymerization are major factors for apical endocytosis . A second aspect of endocytosis in A . nidulans is related to its role in PM transporter down - regula - tion in response to physiological or stress signals ( Gournas et al . , 2010 ; Karachaliou et al . , 2013 ) . Unlike endocytosis related to apical cargoes taking place mostly at hyphal tips , transporter internali - zation takes place homogenously all along the hyphal membrane and necessitates cargo ubiquitina - tion . Transporter ubiquitination requires a group of cargo - specific a - arrestin like proteins , acting as adaptors of the HECT - type ubiquitin ligase HulA Rsp5 . Transporter ubiquitination is followed by inter - nalization and sorting into EEs and the MVB / vacuolar pathway for terminal degradation . Transporter internalization , similar to apical endocytosis , requires actin polymerization and functional endocytic factors SagA End3 or SlaB End4 . Martzoukou et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e20083 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 2 of 26 Research article Cell Biology Curiously , the role of clathrin or AP - 2 in apical or transporter endocytosis had not , until very recently , been investigated in A . nidulans , or other filamentous fungi . An exception is a very recent report that studied clathrin dynamics in A . nidulans , following basically the subcellular localization and role in growth , of the clathrin heavy chain , ClaH ( Schultzhaus et al . , 2017b ) . This report showed that ClaH is localized mostly in late ( trans ) Golgi and secondarily to tentative endocytic sites , and although absolutely essential for growth , it does not seem to be involved in endocytosis . The later conclusion was , however , solely supported by studies concerning the internalization of the FM4 - 64 lipophilic marker , rather than specific endocytic cargoes . This report did not investigate the role of AP - 2 , or any AP complex , in relation to clathrin or to A . nidulans growth . In this work , we investigate the role of the AP - 2 complex and clathrin in polar growth and endocy - tosis in A . nidulans . We present evidence that the roles of AP - 2 and clathrin are distinct , apparently due to an evolutionary truncation of the clathrin - binding domain in the b subunit of AP - 2 in all higher fungi . We further provide evidence that AP - 2 has a specialized , clathrin - independent role related to maintaining proper apical lipid and cell wall composition and thus promoting polar growth . Results Fungal AP complexes possess evolutionary truncated b subunits A recent evolutionary analysis studied the distribution and origin of all AP complex subunits in fungi ( Barlow et al . , 2014 ) . The conclusion from this thorough study was that all fungi possess AP - 1 , AP - 2 or AP - 3 subunits , but most , and apparently all Dikarya , have lost AP - 4 or AP - 5 . Given our interest on the role of AP1 - 3 complexes in membrane traffic and particularly of AP - 2 in endocytosis in A . nidu - lans , we carried out a similar analysis with particular emphasis on Aspergillus species . Figure 1—fig - ure supplement 1 shows that all Aspergilli possess highly similar homologous AP1 - 3 subunits , which can be unambiguously assigned into the distinct AP complexes . Aspergillu s AP subunits are also phylogenetically highly related to homologues from all major fungal groups , as well as , selected model organisms ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Importantly , AP subunits of a given complex are more similar to those of the orthologous complex in distantly related species , than to subunits of other AP complexes of the same species , in line with the acquisition of different functional roles of AP - 1 , – 2 or (cid:0) 3 complexes in cargo membrane traffic . A major and somehow surprising finding concerning the b subunits of not only Aspergillus spe - cies , but most fungi ( all dikarya ) came from the sequence analyses we performed . We observed that the b subunits of all three AP complexes do not contain the C - terminal part , of approximately 332 amino acid residues , which however is present in some primitive fungi , such as the chytrids Rozella allomycis , Allomyces macrogynus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , Spizellomycetales punctatus and Macrophomina phaseolina and in the fungal sister group Fonticula alba ( all sharing 35 – 40 % identity with human b subunits ) ( Figure 1A ) . The C - terminal domain of the b subunit is conserved in several Amoebozoa ( 25 – 36 % identity ) , Rhizaria ( 31 % identity ) , Alveolata ( 29 % identity in Plasmodium or Toxoplasma species ) , Choanoflagellates ( 34 – 44 % identity ) , Mesomycetozoea ( 44 – 50 % identity ) , Algae ( 30 % identity ) , and in the great majority of plants ( 38 % identity ) and Metazoa ( 58 – 60 % iden - tity ) ( Figure 1B and data not shown ) . Some prominent losses , except fungi , were identified in Trypa - nosoma and Leishmania species and in Excavata . Importantly , the lost part corresponds to an essential part of b appendage , which includes two C - terminal domains ( pfam02883 and pfam09066 ) involved in clathrin binding and polymerization , and consequently necessary for the translocation of endocytic accessory proteins to a membrane bud site ( Mousavi et al . , 2004 ; Lemmon and Traub , 2012 ) . A hydrophobic patch present in the lost domain also binds to a subset of D F [ F / W ] motif - con - taining proteins that are bound by the alpha - adaptin appendage domain ( epsin , AP180 ) ( Lemmon and Traub , 2012 ) . Thus , fungal AP complexes might be incapable of interacting , at least via a ‘canonical’ association , with clathrin . Microsporidia , which are probably the only known eukar - yotes lacking clathrin , also lack the clathrin binding domains in their AP complexes ( Barlow et al . , 2014 ) . A major prediction from these observations is that , in fungi , clathrin - dependent processes , such as endocytosis and vesicle budding , might be AP - complex independent , while any role of the AP complexes might in turn be clathrin - independent . Obviously this prediction does not exclude that AP - 2 or AP - 1 complexes might still have the potential to interact with clathrin through unknown binding sequences in the b subunit or domains in other subunits , as for example reported for AP - 1 Martzoukou et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e20083 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 3 of 26 Research article Cell Biology in S . cerevisiae ( Yeung and Payne , 2001 ) . However , subsequent experimental evidence presented herein strongly support a clathrin - independent role of AP - 2 in A . nidulans polar growth . AP - 1 and AP - 2 , but not AP - 3 , complexes are critical for polarity maintenance and A . nidulans growth To investigate the role of AP complexes in cargo membrane traffic and endocytosis in A . nidulans we constructed three null mutants , each carrying a deletion of the gene encoding the s subunit of AP - 1 ( AN7682 ; apa S ) , AP - 2 ( AN0722 ; apbS ) or AP - 3 ( AN5519 ; apcS ) ( http : / / www . aspergillusge - nome . org / and Osmani and Goldman , 2008 ) . Our primary interest was to examine the role of AP - 2 in endocytosis , which however also necessitated the knock - out of the s subunits of AP - 1 and AP - 3 in addition to that of AP - 2 , for excluding any possible functional complementation due to the similarity Figure 1 . The b subunit of fungal AP complexes lacks clathrin - binding domains . ( A ) Cartoon depicting the absence in the b subunits of AP complexes of higher fungi ( A . nidulans , S . cerevisiae or S . pombe ) of a C - terminal region that includes putative clathrin binding domains . The cartoon includes the human AP1 - 3 b subunits as examples of canonical AP complexes , as well as , selected primitive fungi ( Rozella allomycis and Spizellomycetales punctatus ) and F . alba , as examples of lower eukaryotes conserving degenerate versions of putative clathrin binding domains . One signifies the N - terminal adaptin domain ( pfam01602 , ~ 534 amino acids ) common in b subunits of all AP complexes . Two is the a - adaptin C2 domain ( pfam02883 , ~ 111 amino acids ) present in the b subunits of AP - 2 and AP - 1 . Three is the b 2 - adaptin appendage ( pfam09066 , ~ 112 amino acid residues ) present in the b subunits of AP - 2 and AP - 1 , required for binding to clathrin . Four is the so - called clathrin adaptor protein complex b 1 subunit domain , found in AP - 3 complexes , probably required for Golgi association ( pfam14796 , ~ 148 amino acids ) .

Genetic disruption of the s subunits , similarly to disruption of any of the four AP subunits , has been reported to inactivate the function of the full adaptor complex ( Robin - son , 2004 , 2015 ) . Isogenic null mutants were constructed and named thiA p - ap1 s , ap2 s D or ap3 s D ( see Materials and methods ) . For the ap1 s gene , given its knock - out proved lethal ( results not shown ) , we constructed a conditional knock - down strain using the thiamine - repressible promoter , thiA p ( Apostolaki et al . , 2012 ) . The s subunit null mutant strains were analyzed phenotypically and microscopically . Knocking - down ap1 s or deleting ap2 s severely affected growth rate and colony morphology , whereas the ap3 s D mutant exhibited only a very minor delay in growth rate ( inserts in Figure 2A ) . The double mutant strains ap2 s D thiA p - ap1 s and ap2 s D ap3 s D , constructed via standard genetic crossing , had growth rates similar to the single thiA p - ap1 s or ap2 s D mutant , showing that the defect in ap2 s D is independent of AP - 1 or AP - 3 complexes . All mutants tested remained sensitive to selected antifungals , such as 5 - flourouracil , 5 - fluorocytosine or 8 - azaguanine , similar to wild - type iso - genic controls , suggesting that the expression and / or turnover of transporters specific for these anti - fungals is not affected ( not shown ) .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 5 of 26 Research article Cell Biology We examined the microscopic morphology of the mutants constructed . thiA p - ap1 s and ap2 s D , but not ap3 s D , showed altered hyphal morphology , characterized by anomalous polar tube hyper - branching and shorter coenocytic compartments , that is , reduced septa distances ( Figure 2A ) . This effect was confirmed by quantification of the distinct microscopic morphological phenotypes and septa frequencies , as shown in Figure 2B and C . We also tested calcofluor deposition at the apex of polar tips in AP complex mutants , relatively to wild - type . Calcofluor stains chitin and the absence of intense calcofluor - staining at the tip indicates abnormal cell wall synthesis , related to problematic recycling of chitin synthases . This has been observed in mutants blocked in apical endocytosis ( Higuchi et al . , 2009 ) . Calcofluor localization was totally depolarized in thiA p - ap1 s and ap2 s D , similar to what was observed in the endocytic mutant SagA ( Figure 2D ) . Thus , the overall picture obtained with thiA p - ap1 s and ap2 s D mutants was that of defective maintenance of polarity ( Momany , 2002 ; Steinberg , 2014 ) . AP complexes are dispensable for membrane traffic and endocytosis of transporters We investigated the role of the AP complexes on membrane cargo traffic and endocytosis by follow - ing the subcellular localization of a GFP - tagged transporter , namely UapA . UapA is an extensively studied uric acid - xanthine / H + symporter , which has been used as a model cargo for studying the regulation of exocytosis and endocytosis of polytopic membrane proteins in A . nidulans ( Pantazopoulou et al . , 2007 ; Gournas et al . , 2010 ; Karachaliou et al . , 2013 ) . After synthesis and translocation in the ER , fully functional GFP - tagged UapA molecules follow a vesicular secretion pathway to localize homogenously and stably in the PM of hyphal cells . However , UapA molecules undergo ubiquitylation - dependent endocytosis and vacuolar degradation in response to substrate excess or to the presence of rich nitrogen sources ( NH 4 + or glutamine ) . This picture remained unaf - fected when we followed the subcellular localization of UapA - GFP in isogenic thiA p - ap1 s , ap2 s D or ap3 s D mutant backgrounds ( Figure 3A ) . The same picture is obtained under conditions of de novo or continuous UapA - GFP synthesis , or when signals triggering endocytosis are imposed after repres - sion of UapA - GFP synthesis ( data not shown ) . The non - essentiality of the AP - 1 and AP - 3 complexes in UapA traffic was somehow expected , because transporter exocytosis occurs by direct fusion of post - Golgi vesicles with the PM , and seemingly does not involve sorting from the Golgi to the endo - somal compartment . However , the dispensability of AP - 2 , an adaptor involved in the formation of endocytic vesicles in other systems , for UapA - GFP endocytosis was somehow unexpected and con - trasted the picture observed in standard endocytic mutants ( sagA D or thiA p - slaB ) , where UapA inter - nalization from the PM was totally blocked ( see right panels in Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 for the construction of thiA p - slaB ) . The non - involvement of AP - 2 in UapA endocytosis was further confirmed by time - lapse experiments , performed in the ap2 s D mutant strain and an iso - genic wild - type control ( ap2 s + ) , which showed that UapA - GFP internalization initiates at 15 min and becomes more prominent 20 – 30 min after NH 4 + addition in both strains ( Figure 3B ) . The non - involvement of AP - 2 in UapA endocytosis raised issues worthy to be investigated . Firstly , we tested whether the endocytosis of other evolutionary , structurally and functionally distinct trans - porters is also AP - 2 independent . Figure 3C , E and F show that this is indeed the case , as all six transporters tested are internalized with the same efficiency and rate , in both ap2 s D and ap2 s + backgrounds , in response to endocytic signals ( Tavoularis et al . , 2001 ; Vlanti and Diallinas , 2008 ; Apostolaki et al . , 2009 ; Krypotou et al . , 2015 ) . Noticeably , different transporters exhibit different stabilities and endocytic ‘sensitivities’ , but as quantification confirmed ( Figure 3E and F ) , in all cases AP - 2 proved dispensable for their proper internalization rate and turnover . We also examined whether the genetic elimination of a different AP - 2 subunit , other than s 2 , also leads to similar results in respect to transporter endocytosis . We deleted the gene encoding the m 2 subunit of the AP - 2 complex , and subsequently constructed ap2 s D ap2 (cid:22) D double mutants and strains expressing UapA - GFP in the ap2 (cid:22) D background . The ap2 s D , ap2 (cid:22) D and ap2 s D ap2 (cid:22) D mutants had identical phenotypes , characterized by loss of polarity maintenance and poor growth rate ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . UapA - GFP endocytosis operated normally in the ap2 (cid:22) D background , similar to what was observed in the ap2 s D or wild - type isogenic backgrounds ( Figure 3D ) . Overall , these results confirmed that AP - 2 is dispensable for transporter endocytosis . Martzoukou et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e20083 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 7 of 26 Research article Cell Biology Clathrin and AP - 2 have distinct roles in A . nidulans growth and transporter endocytosis We showed that AP - 2 is essential for polarity maintenance , but dispensable for transporter traffick - ing and endocytosis . To investigate the role of clathrin in these processes , we constructed relevant null or conditional mutants of the heavy ( ClaH ) and light ( ClaL ) chains of clathrin . The ClaH null mutant ( claH ) was not viable as it could only be rescued in heterokaryotic transformants ( Osmani et al . , 2006 ) . The ClaL null mutant ( claL ) was viable , but severely affected in growth ( Figure 4A ) . The corresponding conditional mutants were based on the use of the highly repressible thiA p promoter ( Apostolaki et al . , 2012 ) . In the absence of thiamine ( repressor ) , strains expressing thiA p - claH or thiA p - claL grew similar to wild - type isogenic control strains ( not shown ) , whereas in the presence of thiamine thiA p - claH did not grow to form colonies , while thiA p - claL formed very small compact colonies , compatible with a severe growth defect ( Figure 4A ) . Schultzhaus et al . ( 2017b ) , recently reported very similar growth phenotypes . We further examined the thiamine - repressible mutants under the microscope ( Figure 4B ) . The thiA p - claL strain showed normal hyphae morphology and polar growth in the absence of thiamine , but prominent hypha tip swelling under ab initio repression of ClaL , that is , in the continuous presence of thiamine , especially at 37 ˚ C . This pheno - type , which was confirmed by quantification ( Figure 4C – E ) , might be associated with genetic blocks in apical endocytosis of specific cargoes . Knock - down of ClaL did not however modify the polar dep - ositioning of calcofluor staining , which suggests normal chitin synthesis ( Higuchi et al . , 2009 ; Takeshita et al . , 2012 ) , and neither affected polarity maintenance . The thiA p - claH strain also showed normal hyphae morphology and polar growth in the absence of thiamine , but contrastingly , hyphae morphology was severely affected in the continuous presence of thiamine , becoming flat - tened and often showing swelling of tips or conidiospore heads , or becoming thinner and smaller in overall size , an indication of progressive lethality ( Figure 4B and F ) . Still however , polarity mainte - nance was preserved when ClaH was repressed . Thus , in no case the phenotypes resulting from the absence of clathrin , either ClaH or ClaL , resembled those obtained in the absence of AP - 2 . We also asked whether clathrin has a role in transporter endocytosis . Knockdown of ClaL expres - sion blocked ammonium - elicited endocytosis of the UapA transporter , but knockdown of ClaH expression showed a more complex picture ( Figure 4G ) . More specifically , in the latter case , when thiamine was added from the beginning of growth , UapA - GFP showed a rather diffuse and cyto - plasmic appearance , instead of the normal cortical marking of the PM ( notice the magnified area in the relevant insert in Figure 4G ) . This picture was obtained independently from the presence or absence of the endocytic trigger . Under the light of the recent publication of Schultzhaus et al . ( 2017b ) , which showed that ClaH is principally localized in the late Golgi , but also based on our own independent results on the effect of ClaH on other apical markers , described later in this work , it seems that ab initio knockdown of ClaH severely affects secretion of cargoes , including transporters . This leads to apparent Golgi and endosome collapse and progressive lethality , which could easily explain why we detect UapA - GFP in cytosolic structures , rather than in the PM . In addition , a block in transporter secretion would also create a cellular stress signal resulting in further internalization and turnover of transporters .

Notice that repression of claL expression ( o / n thiamine ) blocks UapA - GFP endocytic turnover , ab initio repression of claH expression ( o / n thiamine ) severely blocks UapA - secretion to the PM , whereas claH repression ( 10 hr thiamine ) after pre - secretion of UapA - GFP into the PM ( 14 hr ) leads to an apparent block in secretion , but a fraction of UapA - GFP still remains in the PM .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 9 of 26 Research article Cell Biology To allow secretion and proper localization of UapA - GFP to the PM to take place , and subse - quently to check the role of ClaH in endocytosis , we decided to repress claH expression by adding thiamine after a period of pre - growth ( 14 hr ) in the absence of thiamine . For this , we directly tested whether 5 or 10 hr repression of claH via the thiA promoter is sufficient for depleting ClaH , by per - forming and quantifying immunoblot assays using anti - GFP or anti - actin antibodies against total pro - tein extracts from a strain expressing ClaH - GFP . Results shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 confirmed that addition of thiamine for (cid:21) 10 hr dramatically reduced ClaH . In contrast , 5 hr addition of thiamine had no effect on ClaH steady state levels , apparently because the relevant polypeptide is quite stable . Based on these immunoblots , we examined the effect of ClaH on UapA - GFP endocy - tosis by using at least a 10 hr period of claH repression , after pre - secretion of UapA - GFP into the PM . In this case , a significant fraction of UapA - GFP remained PM - associated despite the appearance of UapA - specific cytoplasmic structures and increased vacuolar degradation , which are however expected outcomes resulting from a block in Golgi functioning and transporter secretion ( Figure 4G , extreme right panel ) . Overall , our results strongly suggest that although both chains of clathrin seem essential for trans - porter ( UapA - GFP ) endocytosis , they do have distinct roles in transporter secretion . ClaL is dispens - able for Golgi functioning and transporter secretion towards the PM , while ClaH seems absolutely essential for Golgi functioning and cargo secretion . These results further support that clathrin and the AP - 2 complex have distinct roles in respect to both cargo secretion and transporter endocytosis . Notably , we also found that FM4 - 64 endocytosis is not affected by deletions of genes encoding AP - 2 complex subunits , clathrin or the endocytic factors SagA and SlaB , suggesting still another pathway of endocytosis in A . nidulans ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . AP - 2 , but not clathrin , is essential for the polar localization of lipid flippases DnfA and DnfB Guided by the fact that lack of a functional AP - 2 complex ( ap2 s D or ap2 (cid:22) D mutants ) leads to defec - tive polarity maintenance and dramatically reduced growth , we tested whether AP - 2 has a specific role in the polar localization of well - studied apical cargoes , such as the v - SNARE SynA ( Valdez - Taubas and Pelham , 2003 ; Pantazopoulou and Pen˜alva , 2011 ) or the DnfA and DnfB flippases ( Schultzhaus et al . , 2015 ) . These are the only presently known recycling cargoes of the endocytic collar shown rigorously to be involved in polar growth ( Pen˜alva , 2015 ) . In parallel , we examined the role of AP - 2 in the polar localization of the endocytic markers , SlaB ( Araujo - Baza´n et al . , 2008 ; Her - vas - Aguilar and Penalva , 2010 ) and SagA ( Karachaliou et al . , 2013 ) , or of AbpA , which marks the sites of actin polymerization ( Araujo - Baza´n et al . , 2008 ) . Appropriate strains were constructed by standard genetic crossing . Figure 5A shows that in the ap2 s D genetic background there is total depolarization of DnfA and DnfB , as these proteins now mark the hyphal PM rather homogenously ( see also Figure 5E , Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast , absence of a functional AP - 2 did not detectably affect the polar localization of SagA , SlaB , SynA or AbpA . Quantification of polarized versus non - polarized localization of these markers confirmed our conclusions ( Figure 5B ) . The same overall results were obtained when we used the ap2 (cid:22) D mutant rather than ap2 s D ( results not shown ) . We tested the role of clathrin ( ClaL ) in the polar localization of DnfA , SlaB and SagA . Figure 5C shows that in a thiA p - claL strain repressed ab initio for ClaL expression , all markers tested remain polarly localized , marking principally the collar region behind the tip ( see also Figure 5E ) . We also tested the role of ClaH in DnfA or DnfB localization ( Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . In a thiA p - claH genetic background , ab initio ( that is , o / n ) addition of thiamine led to cyto - plasmic distribution of DnfA - GFP or DnfB - GFP , which in this case mark large , often bulbous , bodies and a membrane - like network ( upper and lower left panels in Figure 5D ) , resembling the picture obtained when we followed UapA - GFP in the absence of ClaH ( see Figure 4G ) , or when Golgi / endo - somes collapse in response to the presence of Brefeldin A ( BFA ) ( middle panels in Figure 5D ) . We further showed that addition of BFA in the culture medium of a strain expressing ClaH ( de - repressed thiA p - claH ) leads to reversible de - polarization of DnfA - GFP ( lower panel in Figure 5—figure supple - ment 2 ) , but to irreversible de - polarization of DnfA - GFP and progressive apparent hyphae death ( that is , hyphae cells become thinner ) when ClaH expression is repressed ( upper panel in Figure 5— figure supplement 2 ) . This picture is in very good agreement with the reversibility of the negative effect of BFA on Golgi function , which has been rigorously studied in Pantazopoulou and Penalva Martzoukou et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e20083 .

Subcellular localization of DnfA - GFP or DnfB - GFP in wild - type , ap2 s D , thiA p - claL or thiA p - claH isogenic backgrounds .

Importantly , our results show that normal Golgi secretion is necessary for maintaining the polar localization of DnfA - GFP . When ClaH was depleted , by thiamine addition for 10 hr , following a period of pre - growth ( 16 hr ) that allows a fraction of DnfA - GFP or DnfB - GFP to be secreted and polarly localized , a degree of polarization of both flippases was preserved in some hyphae , but in general the polar localization of DnfA - GFP or DnfB - GFP was disrupted ( see upper and lower right panels in Figure 5D and also Fig - ure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . This picture , however , did not constitute a surprise , given the effect of BFA in DnfA - GFP polar localization . It is rather compatible with the idea that a severe block in conventional cargo secretion , obtained either by BFA or by the depletion of ClaH , leads to an inabil - ity to maintain the apical localization of markers , such as DnfA , and apparently DnfB . In summary , our results strongly suggest that the depletion of clathrin does not directly affect the pre - established polarization of flippases . While the dispensability of ClaL in apical cargo localization is clear , the non - essential role of ClaH on flippase polarization establishment is more difficult to for - mally confirm because depletion of ClaH affects Golgi function and secretion , and thus polarization maintenance . Our results are in agreement with results reported in Schultzhaus et al . ( 2017a ) ; ( 2017b ) , which establish that ClaH is localized principally in late Golgi , only weakly in the apical col - lar region and is excluded from the hyphal tip . Overall , these results further showed that AP - 2 and clathrin have distinct roles in cargo subcellular localization in A . nidulans . AP - 2 co - localizes with DnfA , DnfB , AbpA , SagA and SlaB , but not with clathrin or UapA We performed a series of co - localization studies examining the subcellular positioning of AP - 2 in relationship to several membrane cargoes , including endocytic proteins ( SagA and SlaB ) , actin poly - merization markers ( AbpA ) , apical markers ( DnfA , DnfB and SynA ) or transporters ( UapA ) . For that we constructed strains expressing functional Ap2 s - GFP or Ap2 s - mRFP , and crossed these with strains expressing GFP - or RFP - tagged apical markers . Figure 6A shows that , in a wild - type back - ground , Ap2 s - GFP or Ap2 s - mRFP has a polar cortical distribution , marking mostly the endocytic col - lar of growing tips , but also the septa . The apical and cortical localization of Ap2 s - GFP was ‘replaced’ by a rather diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescent signal in an ap2 (cid:22) D genetic background , show - ing that disruption of the full AP - 2 complex by deleting a single subunit also disrupts its physiologi - cal localization . Noticeably , apical localization of Ap2 s - GFP remained unaffected in a genetic background lacking clathrin light chain ( repressed thiA p - claL ) . Kymograph analysis further showed that the AP - 2 complex marking the apical region , including the collar , is rather static . This also sug - gests that AP - 2 is not localized in highly motile early endosomes ( EEs ) . Additionally , no significant co - localization of Ap2 s - GFP was obtained with a marker of the TGN ( PH OSBP ) ( Figure 6—figure sup - plement 1 ) . AP - 2 co - localized cortically , with a high statistical significance ( p < 0 . 001 ) , with SagA ( 80 . 7 % ) , SlaB ( 77 . 4 % ) , DnfA ( 70 . 1 % ) , DnfB ( 77 . 0 % ) , AbpA ( 75 . 8 % ) and SynA ( 68 . 8 % ) . We also quantified and statis - tically confirmed that co - localization of AP - 2 with apical markers ( DnfA and SynA ) occurs basically in the collar region , rather than the apical tip ( lower panel in Figure 6C ) . Noticeably , co - localization of AP - 2 / SlaB or AP - 2 / SagA was modified in genetically deleted sagA D or thiA p - slaB backgrounds , respectively , becoming less polarized and more extending away from the tip ( Figure 6D ) . Impor - tantly , AP - 2 did not co - localize with clathrin ( ClaL ) or UapA ( Figure 6B , C ) . In fact ClaL and UapA , in contrast to all other apical markers , do not localize significantly in the collar region , where apical endocytosis occurs . Given the importance of confirming the non - colocalization of AP - 2 and clathrin for the present work , we obtained additional evidence to support this finding . Figure 6—figure supplement 2 , panel A , shows that strains expressing the chimeric ClaL - mRFP or ClaL - GFP proteins grow similar to wild - type , contrasting the severe growth defects associated with the lack of ClaL expression . This Figure 5 continued Figure supplement 2 . Time course of Brefeldin A effect on DnfA - GFP subcellular localization in a thiA p - claH mutant .

Figure 6 continued on next page Martzoukou et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e20083 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 13 of 26 Research article Cell Biology constitutes good evidence that GFP - or RFP - tagged versions of ClaL are functional . Additionally , panel B shows that the localization of ClaL - GFP or ClaL - mRFP is identical and compatible with the expected localization for clathrin , as in both cases ClaL marks Golgi - like structures and cortical foci . Panel C further shows a rather weak association of ClaL with subcortical patches close to the collar endocytic region . The apparent prominent localization of ClaL in Golgi - like structures is in full agree - ment with results in Schultzhaus et al . ( 2017b ) , who have shown that ClaH - GFP localizes principally in the late Golgi , and has only a weak association with the sub - apical collar region . In the same arti - cle , the authors have further shown that ClaH and ClaL co - localize . Finally , the functionality of ClaL - mRFP was also confirmed by showing that strains expressing ClaL - mRFP are fully active in respect to UapA - GFP endocytosis ( panel D ) , contrasting the block of UapA endocytosis when ClaL is not func - tional ( see Figure 4G ) . To further test the distribution of AP - 2 and clathrin between plasma membrane and internal vesicles , as well as , to assess more rigorously the degree of possible co - localization between these two protein complexes , we analysed the localization of Ap2 s - GFP and ClaL - mRFP by TIRF micros - copy , followed by relevant quantification analysis ( Figure 7 ) . Practically no co - localization of the two polypeptides was observed ( PPC = 0 . 12 ) in the PM . Only a minor fraction of the two polypeptides colocalized ( PPC = 0 . 34 ) intracellularly . These data are in perfect line with the rest of our findings , confirming that the function of AP - 2 in apical endocytosis is clathrin - independent . Overall , our results are also in line with the following notions . First , AP - 2 seems to synergize with endocytic factors SlaB and SagA at the endocytic collar , at sites of actin polymerization , marked by AbpA . Second , disruption of SagA or SlaB , but not of AP - 2 , somehow depolarizes the localization of this endocytic complex . Third , AP - 2 is very probably the cargo - recognition ( for example , DnfA and DnfB ) partner of this complex . Finally , AP - 2 and clathrin are involved in mutually exclusive endocytic or secretion pathways , also supporting a cargo - centric view of membrane trafficking ( Maldonado - Ba´ez et al . , 2013 ) . Further genetic and cellular evidence that AP - 2 is involved in apical lipid maintenance To further establish the role of AP - 2 we tested its genetic interactions with SagA , DnfA and DnfB , but also with proteins involved in apical lipid maintenance , namely StoA and BasA . StoA is a stoma - tin homologue involved in the maintenance of apical sterol - rich membrane domains ( SRDs ) and polarity in A . nidulans ( Takeshita et al . , 2012 ) . In metazoa , stomatins are oligomeric , lipid raft - asso - ciated proteins with scaffolding functions necessary for the maintenance of specific lipid composition in membranes , but their molecular function is still unclear ( Lapatsina et al . , 2012 ) . BasA is required for phytosphingosine biosynthesis and is essential for fungal viability .

For the present work , we used null mutants of SagA ( Karachaliou et al . , 2013 ) , DnfA , DnfB ( Schultzhaus et al . , 2015 ) and StoA ( Takeshita et al . , 2012 ) , and either basA1 or a conditional knock - down mutant of basA , constructed herein using the thiA p promoter . These mutants were all crossed with the ap2 s D strain . Growth phenotypes of the resulting double mutants compared to single mutants are shown in Figure 8A and D . In all cases , double mutants showed reduced growth compared to single mutants ( that is , synthetic negative pheno - types ) , strongly suggesting that the function of AP - 2 is related to that of SagA , DnfA and DnfB , as expected based on the subcellular localization experiments , but also to StoA and BasA . Microscopic examination of the morphology of the mutants confirmed that the defects in AP - 2 and SagA , DnfA , DnfB , StoA or BasA were additive ( Figure 8B , C and E ) . Finally , Figure 8F shows that the localization of AP - 2 s - GFP in a basA1 genetic background is not anymore in the collar region , but instead marks internal structures just behind the tip . All above observations were confirmed by relevant quantita - tive analysis , as shown in Figure 8G and H . Given that AP - 2 was related to BasA , and thus sphingolipid localization , we tested whether AP - 2 also affects the localization of ergosterol , the partner of sphingolipids in lipid rafts . To do so , we used filipin III , an established fluorescent ergosterol marker ( Van Leeuwen et al . , 2008 ) . In wild - type A . nidulans and other filamentous fungi , filipin stains the PM , but with a predominant polar deposi - tion at the hyphal apex ( Li et al . , 2006 ) . We observed significant depolarization , often associated with the appearance of discrete cortical foci and abnormal filipin staining in the ap2 s D , as well as , in thiA p - slaB , stoA D and thiA p - basA mutant backgrounds . In contrast , we observed a polar localization of filipin in thiA p - claL , dnfA D , dnfB D and sagA D mutant strains , similar to wild - type ( Figure 9A ) . Quantification of these results , by measuring the strength of the filipin fluorescent signal along the tip , confirmed the critical role of AP - 2 , as well as , of BasA , SlaB or StoA , in the apical depositioning of ergosterol ( Figure 9B ) . These results further supported that AP - 2 has a specific role in lipid apical localization , distinct from clathrin , necessary polar growth . Figure 7 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 16 of 26 Research article Cell Biology Discussion In mammals , the AP - 2 appendages of a 2 and b 2 subunits orchestrate endocytosis through hierarchi - cal interactions with clathrin , other endocytic proteins and PM lipids . The appendage of the b 2 sub - unit specifically interacts with clathrin ( Keyel et al . , 2008 ; Thieman et al . , 2009 ) . Lower eukaryotes , like free living filamentous fungi , face the challenge of rapid and polarized growth via apical exten - sion , a process that is absolutely dependent on efficient endocytosis and recycling of chaperones and enzymes , related to PM and cell wall deposition at the growing tip ( Pen˜alva , 2010 , 2015 ; Pen˜alva et al . , 2012 ) . Fungi also need both basal and conditionally elicited endocytosis all along their hyphal PM , serving the renewal or modification of membrane components in response to changing nutritional or stress conditions , best exemplified by the endocytic turnover of transporters ( Gournas et al . , 2010 ; Karachaliou et al . , 2013 ; Diallinas , 2014 ) . The role of AP - 2 and that of cla - thrin in the endocytosis of apical cargoes or transporters had not been studied in filamentous fungi , until recently . Here we showed that AP - 2 is dispensable for transporter endocytosis and conventional apical secretion , but essential for polarity maintenance and the polar localization of membrane lipid or cell wall components . In parallel , we showed that clathrin ( both ClaH and ClaL ) is also essential for A . nidulans growth and that ClaH has a critical role in Golgi function and cargo secretion , which is prob - ably the main reason why the ClaH null mutation is lethal . The importance of ClaH in conventional secretion via the Golgi was also recently reported by Schultzhaus et al . ( 2017b ) . An essential role of clathrin in the endocytosis of transporters is also well supported by our results . Importantly , we also showed that the function of ClaL is unrelated to polarity maintenance or the polar localization of lipid or cell wall - related apical cargoes , which contrasts its essential role in transporter endocytosis . Our results also supported that the effect of ClaH depletion in maintaining the polar localization of apical cargoes is due to malfunctioning of Golgi - dependent secretion , rather than a direct effect on the polar localization establishment , similarly to what is observed when BFA is added to growing cells . These results , together with the absence of any significant overlap in the PM localization of Figure 9 . AP - 2 is critical for ergosterol membrane localization .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 17 of 26 Research article Cell Biology clathrin and AP - 2 , and the distinct phenotypes of clathrin and AP - 2 mutants , confirmed that clathrin and AP - 2 are recruited in distinct , cargo - dependent , trafficking pathways . Led by the observation that genetic knock - out of AP - 2 resulted in phenotypes compatible with loss of polarity maintenance , we followed the effect of deleting AP - 2 on the subcellular localization of well - established apical markers . We thus showed that AP - 2 co - localizes apically with endocytic factors SlaB and SagA at sites of actin polymerization in the sub - apical collar region . Subsequently , we provided direct evidence that AP - 2 has a role on the apical localization and function of DnfA and DnfB flippases , and affects ergosterol ( filipin ) and cell wall ( calcofluor ) deposition at the tip . We finally showed that AP - 2 interacts functionally with other proteins involved in apical lipid mainte - nance and scaffolding ( BasA and StoA ) . The key role of AP - 2 in apical endocytosis is in line with pre - vious results showing that proper membrane lipid and cell wall composition is essential for fungal polar growth ( Cheng et al . , 2001 ; Takeshita et al . , 2012 ) . A speculative model on the role of AP - 2 and other relevant factors in apical endocytosis and polarity maintenance is shown in Figure 10 . This model also considers recent findings on the recycling of apical markers described in Schultzhaus et al . ( 2015 ) ; ( 2016 ) ; ( 2017b ) and Pen˜alva ( 2015 ) . An AP - 2 independent role of clathrin in endocytosis is not novel , as it has been reported before in mammals and yeast ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Motley et al . , 2003 ; Sorkin , 2004 ; Traub , 2009 ; Brach et al . , 2014 ) . To our knowledge , however , the opposite is a novel finding , as no other report has shown a major clathrin - independent role of the AP - 2 complex . A role , albeit minor , for AP - 2 in maintaining normal post - endocytic trafficking of major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHCI ) pro - teins and beta1 integrin is the only reported case of a clathrin - independent role of AP - 2 ( Lau and Chou , 2008 ) . Interestingly , Microsporidia possess AP complexes , but not clathrin , which further shows that AP complexes can function without clathrin . The fact that no canonical clathrin binding domains were identified in the b 1 and b 2 subunits of primitive fungi supports the notion that Dikarya have lost clathrin - binding domains during their evolution . The experimental support of a clathrin - independent role of AP - 2 in endocytosis was in good agreement with the in silico observation that the b 2 subunit of AP - 2 of all higher fungi lacks the entire C - terminal b appendage , which includes known clathrin binding domains . Interestingly , clathrin binding domains are also missing from the AP - 1 b subunit ( b 1 ) of all Dikarya , suggesting that in fungi AP - 1 might also function independently of clathrin , very probably being involved in the recycling via the TGN compartment of specific apical proteins . Thus AP - 2 and AP - 1 might function in the same pathway for apical cargo recycling . Inter - estingly , AP - 1 has been reported to function independently of clathrin in phagocytosis in murine macrophages ( Braun et al . , 2007 ) . This has been correlated with the presence of two isoforms of the g - adaptin subunit of AP - 1 in macrophages ( Santambrogio et al . , 2005 ) , and it has been pro - posed that the cleaved form of AP - 1 is the one associated with vesicles present under phagocytic cups ( Braun et al . , 2007 ) . Our findings strongly suggest the existence of clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) related to polar growth in A . nidulans . Over the last years , there has been an increasing interest concerning CIE , not only because it is the mode of entry of bacterial toxins and cell surface proteins ( Maldo - nado - Ba´ez et al . , 2013 ; Mayor et al . , 2014 ) , but also because it has raised strong debates concern - ing its physiological significance . In a recent report , Bitsikas et al . ( 2014 ) , provided evidence that clathrin - independent pathways do not , in fact , contribute significantly to endocytic flux . However , in cases where it has been supported experimentally , CIE seems to be specialized for the maintenance of PM lipid composition ( Shvets et al . , 2015 ) and the endocytosis of proteins anchored to the mem - brane by glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) ( Nichols , 2009 ; Bitsikas et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , in some cases CIE has also been reported to depend on specific PM lipid rafts and / or microdomains , such as caveolae or flotillins ( Glebov et al . , 2006 ) , despite some recent contradicting reports sup - porting that caveolae and flotillins function in organizing PM domains , rather being bona fide endo - cytic factors ( Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ) . Finally , some CIE pathways also depend on dynamin ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) . An apparent conclusion from the above and other studies is that distinctions and variations in both clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( CME ) or CIE seem to arise from the endocytic cargo being examined ( Maldonado - Ba´ez et al . , 2013 ) . Our work suggests that AP - 2 is a key cargo - specific recognition factor in apical CIE in fungi . For long , yeasts were thought to depend solely on CME . However , recent evidence demon - strated the existence of a CIE pathway that depends on the GTPase Rho1 , Rom1 / 2 , formin Bni1 and a - arrestins ( Prosser and Wendland , 2012 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 , 2015 ) . In addition , a CIE pathway Martzoukou et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e20083 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 18 of 26 Research article Cell Biology Figure 10 . A speculative model highlighting the role of AP - 2 in DnfA and DnfB endocytosis at the apical region of A . nidulans growing hyphal cells . After reaching the PM , DnfA and DnfB diffuse laterally to the collar region where they are recognized by AP - 2 and undergo actin polymerization - dependent endocytosis with the help of SagA and SlaB . Endocytic vesicles are sorted in the Early Endosomes ( EEs ) and from there DnfA and DnfB undergo retrograde traffic to the TGN , the Spitzenko¨rper ( a vesicle sorting region in filamentous ascomycetes ; Pantazopoulou et al . , 2014 ) and eventually reach the PM ( Schultzhaus et al . , 2015 ; Pen˜alva , 2015 ) . Extrapolating from the observation that AP - 1 loss - of - function mutants are severely defective in polarity maintenance and growth , similar to AP - 2 mutants , we predict that AP - 1 is involved in the retrograde exocytosis ( green arrows ) of DnfA , DnfB and other cargoes essential for lipid or cell wall ( for example , chitin synthases ) maintenance . The model does not exclude that a fraction of DnfA and DnfB and other cargoes endocytosed by the AP - 2 pathway would undergo degradation after being sorted into degradative EEs that are destined to the vacuole . The model also depicts that transporters and possibly other non - polar membrane proteins are not cargoes of the AP - 2 pathway , but instead undergo clathrin - and a - arrestin - dependent endocytosis , followed by sorting into degradative EEs and eventual degradation in the vacuole ( Vac ) . The model also suggests that SlaB Figure 10 continued on next page Martzoukou et al . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e20083 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20083 19 of 26 Research article Cell Biology was discovered in Candida albicans ( Epp et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , in yeast , a - arrestins are impor - tant for cargo selection in both the CME and CIE , but seem to function by distinct mechanisms in each pathway , as in the CIE pathway , unlike CME , their function is independent of the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase ( Lin et al . , 2008 ; Nikko et al . , 2008 ; Prosser et al . , 2015 ) . Although the involvement of AP - 2 in CIE in yeast has not been examined , the involvement of a - arrestins differentiates it from the apical CIE pathway we identify herein , as none of the A . nidulans arrestin knock - out mutants shows defects in polarity maintenance and growth ( Karachaliou et al . , 2013 ) . This however does not exclude the possibility that the apical CIE pathway in A . nidulans shares other factors of the CIE pathway identi - fied in yeast ( for example , Rho1 , Rom1 / 2 or formin Bni1 ) . In fact , SepA ( orthologue of Bni1 ; Harris et al . , 1997 ; Sharpless and Harris , 2002 ) , is necessary for septum formation and polarity maintenance , and RhoA Rho1 plays a role in polarity , proper branching pattern , and cell wall deposi - tion ( Guest et al . , 2004 ) , phenotypes related to the proposed AP - 2 function . The present work does not intend to explore the mechanistic details of the AP - 2 pathway in A . nidulans or identify the entire set of factors involved . However it shows , for the first time , the exis - tence of a clathrin - independent pathway related to polarity maintenance in filamentous fungi , and most importantly identifies AP - 2 as a key factor for the apical recycling of enzymes , lipids and cell wall components necessary for fungal growth . From the evolutionary point of view , our work sug - gests that in higher fungi the function of the AP - 2 complex has been uncoupled , probably via a spe - cific gene truncation , from clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and that this uncoupling seems to serve specific cellular challenges of fungal polar growth . Materials and methods Media , strains , growth conditions and transformation Standard complete and minimal media ( MM ) for A . nidulans were used . Media and supplemented auxotrophies were at the concentrations given in FGSC ( http : / / www . fgsc . net . ) ( RRID : SCR _ 008143 ) . Media and chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich ( Life Science Chemilab SA , Hellas ) or AppliChem ( Bioline Scientific SA , Hellas ) . Glucose 1 % ( w / v ) was used as a carbon source . NaNO 3 at 10 mM was used as a nitrogen source . Thiamine hydrochloride was used at a final concentration of 5 – 10 m M . A . nidulans transformation was performed as described previously in Koukaki et al . ( 2003 ) . An nkuA DNA helicase deficient strain ( TNO2A7 ; Szewczyk et al . , 2007 ; Nayak et al . , 2006 ) was the recipient strain for generating ‘in locus’ integrations of tagged gene fusions , or gene deletions by the A . fumigatus markers orotidine - 5’ - phosphate - decarboxylase ( AF pyrG , Afu2g0836 ) or GTP - cyclohydrolase II ( AF riboB , Afu1g13300 ) , resulting in complementation of auxotrophies for uracil / uridine ( pyrG89 ) or riboflavin ( riboB2 ) respectively . Transformants were verified by PCR and Southern analysis . Combinations of mutations were constructed by standard genetic crossing . A . nidulans strains used are listed in Supplementary file 1 . Standard nucleic acid manipulations and plasmid constructions Genomic DNA extraction from A . nidulans was as described in FGSC ( http : / / www . fgsc . net ) ( RRID : SCR _ 008143 ) . Plasmid preparation from E . coli strains and DNA bands gel extraction were done using the Nucleospin Plasmid kit and the Nucleospin Extract II kit ( Macherey - Nagel , Lab Supplies Scientific SA , Hellas ) . DNA sequences were determined by VBC - Genomics ( Vienna , Austria ) . South - ern blot analysis using specific gene probes and upstream or downstream fragments in the case of verifying gene deletions , was performed as described in Sambrook et al . ( 1989 ) . [ 32 P ] - dCTP labeled molecules of gene specific probes were prepared using a random hexanucleotide primer kit follow - ing the supplier’s instructions ( Takara Bio , Lab Supplies Scientific SA , Hellas ) and purified on Figure 10 continued and SagA endocytic factors might have roles in both the AP - 2 and clathrin endocytic pathways . Finally , the model shows that SynA ( V - Snare ) is not a cargo of the AP - 2 pathway . The roles of some other factors in exocytosis ( Sec4 , Rab11 , Rab1 , Rab6 and RabE ) or sorting ( RabB ) of cargoes , is based on the work of the group of M . A . Pen˜alva ( Pen˜alva , 2015 ) .

Conventional PCR reactions , high fidelity amplifica - tions and site - directed mutagenesis were performed with KAPA Taq DNA and Kapa HiFi polymer - ases respectively ( Kapa Biosystems , Lab Supplies Scientific SA , Hellas ) . Gene deletions and ‘in locus’ integrations of tagged gene fusions were generated by one step ligations or sequential cloning of the relevant fragments in the plasmids pBluescript SKII , or pGEM - T using oligonucleotides carrying additional restriction sites . These plasmids were used as templates to amplify the relevant linear cas - settes by PCR . For primers and information related to these constructs see Supplementary file 2 . Total protein extraction and western blot analysis Cultures for total protein extraction were grown in MM supplemented with NaNO 3 at 25 o C . Thia - mine hydrochloride was used at a final concentration of 5 – 10 m M . Total protein extraction was per - formed as previously described ( Galanopoulou et al . , 2014 ) . Equal sample loading was estimated by Bradford assays . Total proteins ( 30 – 50 m g ) were separated in polyacrylamide gels ( 8 – 10 % w / v ) and electroblotted ( Mini PROTEAN Tetra Cell , BIORAD ) onto PVDF membranes ( Macherey - Nagel , Lab Supplies Scientific SA , Hellas ) . Immunodetection was performed with a primary mouse anti - GFP monoclonal antibody ( Roche Diagnostics ) , a mouse anti - actin monoclonal ( C4 ) antibody ( MP Bio - medicals Europe ) and a secondary goat anti - mouse IgG HRP - linked antibody ( Cell Signaling Technol - ogy Inc , Bioline Scientific SA , Hellas ) .

Quantification of ClaH - GFP or actin levels using ImageJ were esti - mated separately and relative to each other and are given as ratios , where in each case the lowest value was arbitrarily set as 1 . Phylogenetic analysis BLASTp searches were performed on the NCBI database ( RRID : SCR _ 004870 ) to identify which organisms acquire a C - terminal domain on b AP - 2 subunit , with H . sapiens b AP - 2 as query . The selected sequences were retrieved and , with the use of UniProt database ( RRID : SCR _ 002380 ) , the C - terminal domains were identified and selected from each sequence . The phylogenetic tree recon - struction of the C - terminal domains was performed on MEGA6 software ( RRID : SCR _ 000667 ) ( Tamura et al . , 2013 ) with the maximum - likelihood method and bootstrap testing for 150 replica - tions .
