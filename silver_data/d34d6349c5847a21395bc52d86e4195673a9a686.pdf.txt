Lower attack rates were described in children , but the importance of age in household transmission dynamics remains to be clarified . Methods : During the first month of the outbreak , we enrolled 112 households ( 291 participants ) in a prospective case - ascertained study , collecting demographic and clinical data from index cases and household members . Sera were collected 6 - 8 weeks after index case symptom onset , to measure SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibodies . Findings : T Local Ethics Committee ( # 118664 ) . he overall household attack rate was 45 % assessed by seroconversion , and 47 % when also including RT - PCR positives . Serology identified a significantly higher number of infected household members than RT - PCR . Attack rates were equally high in children ( 43 % ) and young adults ( 46 % ) , but highest among household members aged ≥60 years ( 72 % ) . The attack rate was 16 % in asymptomatic household members , and 42 % in RT - PCR negative household members . Older adults generally had higher antibody titres than younger adults . The risk of household transmission was higher when the index case had fever or dyspnoea during acute illness but not associated with cough . Interpretation : Serological assays provide more accurate estimates of household secondary attack rate than RT - PCR , especially among children who have a lower RT - PCR positivity rate . Children are equally susceptible to infection as adults , but elderly show higher attack rates . Negative RT - PCR or lack of symptoms are not sufficient to rule out infection in household members .

As of 5 th September 2020 , there were more than 26 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , including over 870 , 000 deaths ( 1 ) . In Norway , the first confirmed case of COVID - 19 was identified on 26 th February 2020 ( 2 ) . To combat further spread of the virus in the community , the government implemented comprehensive infection control measures on 12 th March 2020 . However , quarantine of suspected cases and isolation of confirmed cases was practised from late February ( 3 ) . As of 4 th September 2020 , there have been 11 , 200 confirmed cases and 264 deaths in Norway ( 4 ) . Current testing for SARS - CoV - 2 relies on amplification of the viral RNA genome from respiratory specimens , which can generally only be detected during acute infection . Whereas serological assays can determine exposure or infection over a longer time period , and are less dependent on the timing of sampling . Furthermore , with a high proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections ( 5 ) , it is unlikely that data restricted to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) provide the true infection rate of SARS - CoV - 2 . The SARS - CoV - 2 is a novel virus , and there are negligible levels of pre - existing antibodies in the population against the virus ( 6 , 7 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibodies appear in the early convalescent phase approximately two weeks after infection and are maintained for at least four months ( 8 , 9 ) . Therefore , serological assays can provide valuable information on the real infection rate in a community . SARS - CoV - 2 binds to the surface receptors of cells in the respiratory tract through the receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) on its spike protein , and neutralising antibodies prevent infections by blocking viral entry . The secondary attack rate of SARS - CoV - 2 from index cases to household contacts reflects the natural spread of infection in immunologically naive populations with limited preventive measures to control transmission . Respiratory tract infections have been documented to give varying secondary attack rates in families , particularly in influenza , where previous pandemics have reported rates from 4 % to 20 % or higher ( 10 ) . With no immunity in the population , a higher household secondary attack rate would be expected with SARS - CoV - 2 . Previous studies on the household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 have reported attack rates , ranging from 7·6 % to 38 % , based on RT - PCR of either single or repeated respiratory samples from household contacts of SARS - CoV - 2 cases ( 11 - 20 ) . However , sensitive serological assays are likely to give more accurate estimates of attack rates ( 21 ) , regardless of whether household members are asymptomatic or RT - PCR negative . Here , we estimated the secondary household attack rate of SARS - CoV - 2 and identified the determinants of household transmission by measuring SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibodies in household members of RT - PCR confirmed cases during the first month of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Norway .

Testing for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR from throat swabs was centralized at Bergen Municipality Emergency Clinic for the city . All RT - PCR confirmed cases tested at the clinic during the start of the local outbreak ( 28th February – 4th April 2020 ) , and their household members were eligible for the study . Household members were defined as individuals who resided in the same household as a confirmed case , termed as index case hereafter . Index cases and their household members were contacted by telephone and asked to participate in the study . In households with > 1 case , the member first diagnosed with COVID - 19 was defined as the index case , and non - primary cases were defined as household members . Households where a case resided alone or no household members were willing to participate in the study , were excluded from the analysis . The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee ( # 118664 ) . All participants and / or their guardians provided written informed consent before inclusion in the study . Clinical information Electronic case report forms ( eCRF ) were developed using REDCap® ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) ( Vanderbilt University , Nashville , Tennessee ) . The eCRF for index cases contained demographics , COVID - 19 - like symptoms , recent travel history , recent close contact with confirmed COVID - 19 cases , as well as household size and number of household members that had been ill with similar symptoms . Household members were contacted individually to register information on gender , age , RT - PCR test result ( if available ) , and COVID - 19 - like symptoms . Serological assays Serum samples from index cases and household members were collected 6 - 8 weeks after symptom onset in the index case . Sera were stored at - 80°C and heat - inactivated for one hour at 56°C before use in serological assays . Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) A two - step ELISA was used for detecting SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibodies , initially by screening with receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) and then confirming seropositivity by spike IgG ( 6 ) ( see supplementary methods ) . Endpoint titres were calculated as the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving an optical density ( OD ) value = 3 standard deviations above the mean of historical pre - pandemic serum samples ( n = 128 ) ( supplementary figure 1 ) . Individuals with no antibodies were assigned a titre of 50 for calculation purposes . Since the historical serum samples were defined as seronegative , and recruitment was initiated from the first case , we assume that all participants were seronegative at baseline and the term seroconversion is used for participants with seropositive spike - specific IgG . Neutralisation assays The neutralisation assays were used to quantify SARS - CoV - 2 - specific functional antibodies ( see supplementary methods ) . The assays were performed in a certified Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory using a Norwegian clinical SARS - CoV - 2 virus at 2000 tissue culture infectious All rights reserved .

In the microneutralisation ( MN ) assay , virus infectivity was measured by detecting the amount of nucleoprotein after 24 hours incubation in Vero cells . The MN titre ( IC 50 ) was determined as the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving 50 % inhibition of virus infectivity . In the virus neutralisation ( VN ) assay , the cytopathic effect ( CPE ) in Vero cells was recorded after 4 - 5 days . VN titres were determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution giving no CPE . Negative titres ( < 20 ) were assigned a value of 10 for calculation purpose . Statistical methods Risk factors for seroconversion , including household member’s age , gender , RT - PCR - status and symptoms , the size of the household , and characteristics of the index case , were presented as proportions and assessed in univariable analysis by chi - square test for binary explanatory variables , and by logistic regression for factors with multiple levels , using the level with most observations as reference . A p - value of < 0·05 was defined as the cut - off for statistical significance . Comparison of continuous variables , such as antibody titres , was performed by Mann - Whitney U test . Analyses were performed in R 4·0·2 ( www . R - project . org ) . Graphs were drawn in Prism 7 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA ) . Role of the funding sources The funding bodies had no role in study design , collection , analysis and interpretation of data , in writing the manuscript , and in the decision to submit this paper for publication . Results Participants Between 28th February and 4th April 2020 , 223 out of 3319 RT - PCR tested individuals were identified as SARS - CoV - 2 positive in Bergen , and deemed eligible for the study . All positive cases were contacted , of which 194 cases were enrolled in the study . Among 258 eligible household members , 148 were enrolled in the study . In households where more than one case resided , the primary case was defined as the index case and 31 non - primary cases were redefined as household members . Fifty - one cases of single - person households were excluded from the analysis . The final sample used for analysis consisted of 112 index cases and 179 household members ( figure 1 and 2B ) . Overall , there was an equal distribution of males and females in both index cases and household members , although household members were younger than the index cases ( table 2 ) . A large proportion ( 73 % , 130 / 179 ) of household members reported having COVID - 19 compatible symptoms ( supplementary table 1 ) . Attack rate defined by seroconversion To calculate the attack rate , we measured SARS - CoV - 2 - specific IgG in household members using the spike protein ELISA to confirm seroconversion . The overall attack rate in households was 45 % , with no significant gender difference ( table 1 ) . Attack rates varied between 25 % and 72 % among the different age cohorts . The elderly ( > 60 years old ) had a significantly higher attack rate ( 72 % ) than adults < 60years old ( 46 % , p = 0·045 ) . Interestingly , the attack rate in children ( 43 % ) was similar to that of adults ( 46 % ) . Similar trends were observed when using 10 - year age cohorts with significantly higher attack rate in the oldest household members ( supplementary table 2 ) . Titres of spike - specific IgG among seropositive children < 10 years old were significantly higher ( p = 0 . 03 ) than in adults ( 21 - 31 years old ) All rights reserved .

The presence of any COVID - 19 symptoms among household contacts significantly increased the likelihood of infection ( p < 0 . 01 ) , with seroconversion occurring in 56 % of symptomatic and 16 % of asymptomatic household members ( table 1 ) . At a household - level , household size was not convincingly associated with household transmission . Attack rates were highest in two - person households , but household size varied between age groups , with the majority of the oldest household members living in two - person households ( table 1 ) . Comparison of RT - PCR and seroconversion The seroconversion and RT - PCR positivity rates were further compared in the 70 household members who were RT - PCR tested during acute illness . We found that serological assays detected a higher number of infected household members than RT - PCR ( 44 / 70 vs 32 / 70 ) , and thus are more sensitive than RT - PCR in detecting infected individuals ( figure 4 ) . Of the 32 household members who tested positive by RT - PCR during acute illness , only four ( 13 % ) did not seroconvert ( table 1 ) . If infection is defined by seroconversion or RT - PCR positivity , the overall attack rate was 47 % among household members . As only symptomatic people were tested , RT - PCR positivity among asymptomatic household members was not assessed . Interestingly , among the household members who were RT - PCR tested , as many as 43 % of the negatives seroconverted ( table 1 ) . Spike antibody titres were also compared between RT - PCR negative and RT - PCR positive members ( figure 5D ) . Among RT - PCR tested household members who seroconverted , the spike antibody response was equally strong regardless of RT - PCR results . Interestingly , among children with symptoms compatible with COVID - 19 , only 11 % ( 1 / 9 ) of those tested with RT - PCR were positive , while 60 % ( 12 / 20 ) seroconverted . In contrast , among symptomatic persons ³ 60 years , 89 % ( 8 / 9 ) of those tested were RT - PCR positive , while 81 % ( 13 / 16 ) seroconverted . Neutralising antibody responses Neutralising antibodies can prevent reinfection with SARS - CoV - 2 and we further analysed the neutralising antibody response by using the sensitive microneutralisation assay and the virus neutralisation assay to measure sterilising immunity . Significantly higher neutralisation titres were found in adults 60 years old ( figure 3 ) . Although children had higher spike - specific IgG than adults ( 21 - 30 years ) , they had similar titres of neutralising antibodies and some children did not have neutralising antibodies , particularly virus neutralising antibodies ( figure 3 ) . Interestingly , the levels of spike - specific antibodies and microneutralising antibodies were similar among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals ( figure 5A - B ) . There was a trend of higher virus neutralising antibodies among symptomatic household members , although not statistically significant ( figure 5C ) . Among the household members who were RT - PCR tested , the levels of neutralising antibodies were equally high among RT - PCR positive and RT - PCR negative participants ( figure 5E - F ) . Risk factors for transmission The risk factors for household transmission are presented in table 2 and supplementary table 2 . Household - members ³ 60 years old ( p = 0·045 ) , and those reporting symptoms ( p < 0·001 ) had higher risk of acquiring infection . Index - cases of seroconverting household - members had significantly higher titres of spike - specific IgG ( p = 0 . 044 ) and virus neutralisation ( p = 0 . 004 ) All rights reserved .

Whereas attack rates did not increase when the index case had a cough ( p = 0·9 ) , transmission was more likely when the index cases had fever ( p = 0·002 ) or dyspnoea ( p = 0·02 ) . Discussion Studies on household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 provide crucial knowledge about the transmission dynamics of the virus in immunologically naïve individuals in a home environment characterized by limited personal protection . Norway contained community transmission at an early phase of the pandemic’s first wave by prompt implementation of measures to reduce contact between people in society . This ensured that our study was conducted with low levels of community transmission and negligible baseline immunity among the participants , which can otherwise confound household transmission studies . To investigate household transmission , we recruited the initial 112 households of RT - PCR confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 index cases during the first month of the outbreak in Bergen , in a prospective , case - ascertained study . Our study was explicitly designed to measure household secondary attack rates based on the serological evaluation of SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibodies . We found higher rates of transmission within households than previously reported ( 11 - 20 ) , particularly in young children and elderly ( > 60 years old ) . The overall household attack rate as measured by seroconversion among household members of RT - PCR confirmed , home - isolated cases was 45 % . Currently , there are only two other studies that have estimated household attack rates based on seropositivity , 37·4 % in Spain ( 7 ) and 35 % in Brazil ( 22 ) . Although both studies had large sample sizes in the early phase of the pandemic , they are population - based serosurveillance surveys which had high levels of community transmission and they cannot confirm that subjects were infected by a household member . Our study was specifically designed to assess household attack rates as measured by seropositivity in household members 6 - 8 weeks after onset of symptoms in the index case , with low prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 virus in the community . Thus , our data provide a more accurate estimate of attack rates . We calculated attack rates based on SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibodies in household members , whereas the majority of previous studies have ascertained transmission based on RT - PCR , with estimates of 7·6 % to 38 % ( 11 - 20 ) . RT - PCR can only detect SARS - CoV - 2 during the acute phase , and has been reported to have an unsatisfactory positivity rate ( 23 , 24 ) . Thus , the household secondary attack rates in RT - PCR - based studies is likely underestimated . This is supported by our finding that the seroconversion rate among RT - PCR negative household members ( 43 % ) , was as high as the overall seropositivity rate among all household members ( 45 % ) . Although we have a relatively small subgroup of RT - PCR negative household members during the inclusion period , our findings have two major implications . Firstly , using RT - PCR among household contacts of confirmed cases has a low predictive value , and solely relying on RT - PCR could consequently cause further transmission from false - negative cases to new individuals in both the household and the community . Secondly , our findings highlight that serological testing is equally or more effective than RT - PCR in confirming a final diagnosis of COVID - 19 , especially among household contacts . This is supported by several studies demonstrating the importance of serological testing to confirm cases ( 25 , 26 ) . However , among the household members in our study who had a positive RT - PCR test at the time of symptoms , 12 % did not seroconvert . Extrapolation of this finding to our total cohort gives a total attack rate of 51 % . Thus , the true attack rate in our study is likely higher than All rights reserved .

Our data also show that neutralisation assays seem to be less sensitive to detect attack rates than spike - specific IgG . Children have been reported to be less affected by COVID - 19 ( 27 ) and previous studies have reported a secondary attack rate of 4 % to 23·1 % among children ( 13 , 14 , 17 ) . However , our study indicates that a larger proportion of children aged 0 - 12 years were infected ( 43 % ) in a household setting . The lower attack rates in previous studies may be due to the use of RT - PCR as a diagnostic method , consequently underestimating the number of secondary cases among children . Indeed , our data show a far lower positivity rate on RT - PCR among symptomatic children compared to serological testing , which contrasts with older age cohorts . Due to the low number of RT - PCR tested children in our study , this observation needs to be confirmed in larger studies , but suggests careful consideration of especially negative RT - PCR results in children . Age cut - offs as well as the testing criteria probably also play an important role in variations in reported SARS - CoV - 2 infection risk in children . Estimates of transmission to children are also likely to be lower since children often present with milder symptoms , possibly resulting in lower testing rates . We conducted serological testing of all children among the household members , regardless of symptoms . With an attack rate above 40 % as measured by seroconversion , our results show that children may have higher infection rates than has been previously reported ( 7 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 , 28 ) . The youngest index case was 15 years old in our study , and further studies of the role of children in transmission of the virus are urgently needed . In our study , household members ³ 60 years old appeared to have the highest attack rate ( 72 % , table 1 ) . Our study thus confirms findings from other studies on household transmission among older age groups ( 12 , 15 ) , while two studies have showed lower transmission to the oldest age cohort ( 13 , 19 ) . Moreover , we found neutralising antibodies in all but one of the seropositive participant aged ³ 60 years ( figure 3 ) . As old age is strongly associated with morbidity and mortality , one may speculate that strong , neutralising antibody responses may be harmful . The finding that index cases with fever and dyspnoea were more likely to transmit infection to others , is not surprising as patients with more severe symptoms may require closer follow - up and care , incurring increased risk of transmission . Similarly , the higher antibody - titres found in index cases of seroconverters may be a surrogate marker for higher and / or prolonged virus loads . It may appear counterintuitive that cough in the index case was not a significant risk factor for transmission . A likely explanation for this would be that , due to widespread awareness of this transmission route , cough would trigger household - members to use precautions such as distancing and mask use , while a person with other symptoms such as fever and dyspnoea may not be perceived as equally infectious . According to a recent meta - analysis ( 5 ) , an average of 15 % of RT - PCR confirmed cases are asymptomatic . We found that 17 % of asymptomatic household contacts seroconverted , and in addition , 43 % of RT - PCR negative household members seroconverted . Thus , our findings show that close contacts of confirmed cases are potentially contagious , irrespective of being asymptomatic or having a negative RT - PCR result . Whilst self - isolation of cases and good hygiene may prevent infection within a household , pre - existing immunity may also be important . Recently , pre - existing cross - reactive T - cell immunity derived from infection with human coronaviruses has been speculated to protect from infection ( 29 ) . Although , the immune response to the SARS - CoV - 2 virus is multifaceted and the correlates of protection from COVID - 19 disease have yet to be defined . The presence All rights reserved .

No neutralising antibodies were found in the household members who did not have spike - specific IgG ( supplementary figure 3 ) . When comparing the different assays , we found the highest attack rates measured by spike - specific antibodies , and lower numbers of household members developed neutralising antibodies . We did not specifically study the immunological mechanism of protection from infection household members who were not infected , and future studies on the impact of pre - existing cross - reactive immunity will be important in understanding the groups at highest risk for infection . The strengths of our study are the centralized testing facility which allowed for the identification of all RT - PCR test positive cases in Bergen , the low levels of community spread and the stringent use of serological assays to define infected people , firstly by screening all subjects for RBD - specific antibodies , then confirming infection by SARS - CoV - 2 spike ELISA . The study was specifically designed to identify household attack rate , and inclusion started with the first RT - PCR positive case in the city , followed by detailed interviews to differentiate between index cases and household members . The interpretation of our findings has several limitations which may influence our estimation of attack rates . Despite high participation rates , there may have been a bias in who consented to participate , limiting and influencing our interpretation of results . There was also a risk that the index case was not correctly identified , although to minimize this , extensive telephone interviews were conducted once a positive case was identified . Likewise , we cannot exclude the possibility that some cases and household members had a common source of exposure outside the household , although the national shutdown appears to have eliminated the transmission of respiratory viruses in general , as evidenced by the abrupt drop in influenza cases . Lastly , the screening algorithm used by the municipality changed mid - March , with prioritisation of health - care workers and patients with underlying chronic conditions , potentially limiting the identification of patients . In conclusion , we found a higher household attack rate of SARS - CoV - 2 than previous studies , and show that serological testing is superior to RT - PCR - testing in assessing attack rates . Children are far more susceptible to household - transmission than previously reported , and relying on RT - PCR for diagnosis may miss the majority of infected children . This highlights the importance of including children when considering measures to reduce spread of SARS - CoV - 2 virus . The risk of transmission was highest from index cases with dyspnoea , fever and high titres of neutralising antibodies , all potential surrogate markers for severity of disease , illustrating that transmission risk increases with the need for close care .

We expressed and purified the RBD as previously described ( 6 ) . After clarifying cell culture medium by centrifugation , the supernatant was loaded into a HiFliQ Ni Advance column ( ProteinArk ) , and we determined protein concentration with Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay using BSA as standards ( Bio - Rad ) . Initially , we prepared spike trimer according to Staldbauer et al . 2020 with the exception that we captured spike trimer as above . We gradually shifted for expression in ExpiCHO cell following manufacturers protocols and recommendations ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) in Optimum Growth flask ( Thomson Instrument Company ) . In later batches , we found that extended expression time in 32°C ExpiCHO or Expi293F cells gave higher yields and less lower molecular weight contaminations in Corning Erlenmeyer or Optimum Growth flasks ( Esposito et al . 2020 , Herrera et al . 2020 ; PMID : 32504802 ; preprint PMID : 32587972 ) . Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) The ELISA for detecting SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - specific antibodies was performed as previously described ( 6 ) and used to screen all index case and household members serum samples for RBD - specific antibodies . ELISA plates ( Thermo Fisher ) were coated with 50 μL of SARS - CoV - 2 RBD protein ( 2 μg / mL ) in PBS at 4°C overnight and sera tested at 1 : 100 dilution , followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) labeled goat anti - human IgG ( Sigma ) and development with 3 , 3´ , 5 , 5´ - tetramethylbenzidine ( TMB ) ( BDbiosciences , E - 2886 ) for 10 minutes . Plates were read at 450 nm and 620 nm ( background ) using a synergy H1 plate reader ( BioTek ) . A negative cut - off OD < 0·5036 was defined by using historical serum samples collected before 2020 ( n = 128 ) . A confirmation spike ELISA was performed to quantify the SARS - CoV - 2 spike - specific antibodies in subjects with positive screening results , as described for the screening ELISA , with the following modification . Plates were coated with 2 μg / mL of spike protein . Serum samples were 5 - fold serially diluted from 1 : 100 . Plates were incubated for 15 minutes with TMB before stopping . The endpoint titres were calculated using Prism 8 . Endpoint titre was defined as the highest serum dilution to give an OD value > 3 standard deviations above the historical serum samples collected before the pandemic ( n = 128 ) . Individuals with undetectable levels of antibodies were assigned an endpoint titre of 50 for plotting and calculation purposes . Historical serum samples collected before 2019 were defined as seronegative in the RBD ELISA , which was confirmed with RT - PCR negative healthcare worker sera collected during the pandemic ( unpublished results ) . As recruitment was initiated with the very first case of SARS - CoV - 2 identified in Bergen municipality , we assume all participants were assumed seronegative at baseline and seropositivity with spike - specific IgG is termed seroconversion . SARS - CoV - 2 Virus A clinical SARS - CoV - 2 strain was isolated in - house from a throat swab of a Norwegian RT - PCR confirmed patient , propagated in Vero cells , and named as SARS - CoV - 2 / Human / NOR / Bergen1 / 2020 . Microneutralisation assay The microneutralisation ( MN ) assay was used to investigate the microneutralising titres , which can prevent infection . The assay was performed in a certified Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory . Serum samples were tested against clinical isolated virus : SARS - CoV - 2 / Human / NOR / Bergen1 / 2020 ( GISAID accession number pending ) . Two or more biological replicates were performed . Briefly , serum samples were heat inactivated at 56°C for 60 minutes , analysed in serial dilutions ( duplicated , starting from 1 : 20 ) , and mixed with 100 TCID50 viruses in 96 - well plates and incubated for one hour at 37 °C . Mixtures were transferred to 96 - well plates seeded with Vero cells . The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours . Cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol and 0 . 6 % H 2 O 2 , and incubated with rabbit monoclonal IgG against SARS - CoV2 NP ( Sino Biological ) . Cells were further incubated with biotinylated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( H + L ) ( Southern Biotech ) , and Extravidin - peroxidase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The reactions were developed with o - phenylenediamine dihydrochloridec ( OPD ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The MN titre was determined as the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving 50 % inhibition of virus infectivity . Negative titres ( < 20 ) were assigned a value of 10 for calculation purposes .

Recruitment procedure of study participants . 1 The first case was diagnosed on 28 th February in Bergen , Norway (cid:182)(cid:86) second largest city . Between 28 th 2 February and 4 th April 2020 , 223 SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR cases were identified among 3319 SARS - 3 CoV - 2 suspected cases that were tested at the Bergen Municipality Emergency Clinic , out of which 4 194 RT - CPR positive individuals were included in the study . There were 258 eligible household 5 members in total , out of which 148 were included . In households with more than one RT - PCR positive 6 case , 31 non - primary cases were redefined as household members . In total , we included 291 people 7 comprising 112 index cases living with others and their 179 household members . Fifty - one cases were 8 not included in the analyses as they lived alone or were defined as single person households because 9 they did not have household members who wished to participate in the study . 10 11 Figure 2 . The course of the first wave of the pandemic in Bergen and period of recruitment of 12 index cases and household members . 13 ( A ) The daily number of SARS - CoV - 2 - positive cases ( shown in orange ) from the centralised testing 14 centre at Bergen Municipality Emergency Clinic covering a population of 284 · 000 people and the daily 15 number of COVID - 19 deaths ( shown in purple ) in Bergen , Norway ( left Y axis ) . The number of 16 hospitalised patients from SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Bergen is shown in blue ( right Y axis ) . Lockdown 17 was initiated in Norway on 12 th March , and a gradual reopening starting on 20 th April 2020 . ( B ) The 18 number of household members recruited ( shown in red ) during the recruitment period ( gray shaded 19 area ) . Clinical information was collected from the index case and their household members at the time 20 of recruitment . Blood samples were collected 6 - 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms in the index case 21 ( for one case serum was collected 3 weeks after inclusion , and for one case serum was collected 10 22 weeks after inclusion ) . Sera from all household members were tested against the receptor - binding 23 domain ( RBD ) of spike protein in a screening ELISA . RBD - specific IgG are shown as the optical 24 density ( OD ) at 1 / 100 dilution of sera ( shown in blue , right Y axis ) . Each symbol represents one 25 subject . The horizontal dotted line indicates OD 0 . 5 as the cut - off defined by a panel of 128 pre - 26 pandemic sera . Duplicates were performed in ELISA . 27 28 Figure 3 .
