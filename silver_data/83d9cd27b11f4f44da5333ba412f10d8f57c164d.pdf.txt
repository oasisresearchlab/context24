HCI research has explored the complexities of tasks and challenges character - ising home - based unpaid carers , as they manage end - to - end care , alone and without support [ 9 , 16 , 28 , 51 , 74 ] , where citizens find themselves forced to assemble personal infrastructures that tie to - gether the multiple , siloed healthcare service providers they depend upon [ 30 ] . Research in this area has focused on developing care - ful design of technologies that ‘work’ for these ‘seldom heard’ 3 populations , traditionally considered at the margins , with explicit attempts to support their empowerment [ 31 ] . Scholars have also paid significant attention to mitigating potential negative ( unin - tended ) consequences ensuing from socio - technical interventions and fostering caring relations [ 44 ] . One important strategy in this area has focused on the inclusion of disabled citizens and their unpaid carers in the design of systems that are to benefit them , and for these to be centred around matters of concerns [ 6 , 7 , 37 , 43 , 73 ] . Yet , research in this area faces key challenges . HCI has high - lighted issues of access , equity and power dynamics when working with marginalised communities in design processes [ 2 , 18 , 19 , 37 , 48 ] ; it has also problematised the extent to which interventions can be deemed sustainable [ 5 , 70 , 76 , 82 ] . This latter aspect is signifi - cant , given that universities’ research cultures are characterised by short - term projects bounded by research funding , that sees re - searchers dipping in and out of contexts [ 63 , 85 ] and focusing on the design of novel products , rather than questions of sustainabil - ity and democratic considerations for the learning and empower - ment of participants [ 13 ] . These challenges are foregrounded with marginalised populations , where the researchers , often ‘external’ to the contexts they study or operate in , can struggle to understand complex ecosystems , leading to false assumptions and unhelpful interventions that can have negative consequences , leaving par - ticipants feeling powerless [ 75 , 80 , 90 ] . Building on this body of 1 We employ identify - first language as it is the established norm in the locale of this study ( the United Kingdom ) and consistent with how our participants referred to themselves and their children . We recognise this is a personal preference deserving of respect , with differing and fluctuating positions across individuals , groups , and regions . 2 Alternative terms are seen in literature for individuals that are not paid for their caring of a family member or friend , including ‘informal carers’ , ‘parent carers’ , and ‘caregivers’ . We use ‘unpaid carers’ as used by our participants and the United Kingdom government [ 29 , 59 ] , rejecting ‘informal’ as a term that infers non - professional or casual [ 91 ] . 3 We avoid use of the term ‘hard to reach’ as it can imply marginalised populations bear the responsibility for engagement in research . Instead , we use the emergent term of ‘seldom heard’ , denoting “those who are often not included in recruitment” [ 25 ] due to their marginalisation and experiences of adverse health experiences and outcomes [ 77 ] . CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Peter Glick and Clara Crivellaro work , we ask how co - creating socio - technical responses with disabled citizens and their unpaid carers can sustainably help address some of their immediate needs , while fostering critical reflections on questions of governance , trust and responsibility in digital innovations and their design ? We report on a study that involved a collaboration with 23 dis - abled citizens , unpaid carers and a third sector care organisation in the United Kingdom ( UK ) . The study aimed to build safe design spaces to enable a citizens - led co - design of a digital intervention that leveraged the whole life skills of participants [ 37 , 81 , 88 , 90 ] , while attending to questions of values , responsibility , and sustain - ability . In a context characterised by increasing individualisation and fragmentation of healthcare service provision due to neoliber - alism [ 30 , 66 ] , we describe how our participatory process leveraged the authors’ skills alongside the participants’ situated knowledge arising from , but not limited to , their care practices [ 35 ] . Employing novel configurations of participatory design methods and tools that were devised to support remote and asynchronous participation , given our participants’ unpredictable lives due to their priorities of care — the collaboration co - created a digital commons , “My - CareBudget” 4 , that responded to the challenges they face in man - aging personalised healthcare infrastructures . We show how our co - design methods and process enabled the collective identification of risks and consequences in a digital intervention’s design and outcome , critical for a population with complex healthcare needs [ 15 , 57 , 67 ] . Anticipating ethical implications , complexities , and costs associated with the long - term maintenance of novel computer systems , we describe how the co - creation of a digital commons [ 76 ] facilitated consideration of democratic questions of sustainability , governance , risks and responsibility in digital interventions and community - driven activism [ 5 , 37 , 55 , 69 , 89 ] . This clarifying de - sign , financial and administrative commitments and roles upfront in the co - design process . Our study responds to Bødker and Kyng’s call for “PD that mat - ters” , where participants are positioned as research partners , and researchers work with them as activists to achieve meaningful and sustainable outcomes , and sustained democratic control over technology [ 13 ] . Sitting at the intersection of healthcare and so - cial justice , our case study contributes to critical disability studies [ 14 ] , health activism [ 68 , 84 ] , and HCI concerned with developing sustainable interventions through digital commons [ 55 , 86 ] in the context of personal healthcare infrastructures . The work shows how participatory methods can configure effective co - creation part - nerships and collective action with marginalised populations to seek social change [ 68 ] through the co - design of a sustainable digi - tal commons that delivered mutual aid - used by over 5 , 000 people worldwide . We contribute insights from an asynchronous and remote co - design process with a community of disabled citizens and unpaid carers , configured to enable participation and examine issues of trust , ownership , risk , and responsibility in the design of digital interventions . This study was conducted in the UK , however , our insights and methods are relevant to HCI researchers worldwide who study the design of digital infrastructures with and for disabled citizens and their carers . 4 www . MyCareBudget . org 2 RELATED WORK Building healthcare infrastructures with and for unpaid carers is a growing area of interest in HCI research . This is partly due to the increasing number of unpaid carers across the global north [ 74 ] , who are engaged in the mentally , emotionally and physically demanding work of caregiving , with limited resources for support [ 16 , 17 ] . Indeed , studies over the last decade have examined the work and challenges of providing care in a home setting for those with complex long - term health conditions [ 9 , 16 , 28 , 51 , 74 ] . Across these studies , citizens were found to be operating within a siloed set of healthcare service providers offering little support in managing care , each citizen forced to assemble their individual care infras - tructures [ 17 , 30 , 31 , 71 ] . The work required of citizens to connect , configure , and navigate infrastructures and relational practices between the forms of care provided by hospitals , clinicians , paid carers , pharmacies , support agencies , financial organisations , fam - ilies , and friends , is essential — yet unpaid and invisible [ 17 ] . In response , HCI has offered differing approaches to alleviating and ameliorating the lives of disabled citizens and their unpaid carers as they build personal healthcare infrastructures . For example , Chen et al . [ 16 ] suggested how integrating technology responses could improve carers’ productivity vis - a - vis their invisible and high work - loads , and related stresses . Yet , Gui et al . [ 31 ] called to expand the scope of design for this population , identifying the navigation of healthcare infrastructures as a critical part of their care work . Gui et al . further urged the HCI community to consider how the de - sign of online platforms might benefit unpaid carers by supporting knowledge sharing and empowerment . Building on these studies , Schurgin et al . [ 74 ] found that access to resources was critical to their infrastructuring work , asking HCI to consider the complex roles and relationships of the unpaid carer . Echoing this appeal , Kaziunas et al . [ 44 ] problematised tendencies to techno - solutionism when designing for and with this marginalised population , asking HCI to engage with the complexities of social and political contexts of healthcare systems . Movements such as disability justice [ 14 ] and health activism [ 68 , 84 ] in HCI , have advocated for the need to conduct research that foregrounds participants’ lived experience , repositioning them as active co - creators of research [ 6 , 7 , 37 , 43 , 73 ] , best encapsu - lated by the statement , “Nothing About Us , Without Us” [ 14 , 75 , 90 ] . Challenging narrow understandings of disabled communities as a population with ‘deficiencies’ and needs [ 4 , 56 , 81 , 90 ] , this body of research calls for collaborative research endeavours to recog - nise disabled citizens’ expertise as extending far beyond that of , for example , their care practice [ 8 , 52 , 88 ] . However , collaborative design and collective action with marginalised and underserved populations present challenges for both HCI researchers and cit - izens . The citizens’ participation in face - to - face workshops and other group activities is inhibited by both social barriers that force their isolation , and the unpredictability of their lives due to care responsibilities [ 28 , 30 , 68 ] . Opening up spaces for participatory en - gagements between marginalised populations and their authorities , also demands careful consideration , as existing power dynamics between these groups can inhibit input from the citizen who fears reprisal when criticising services [ 2 , 19 , 28 ] . MyCareBudget : Co - creating a Healthcare Digital Commons CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany The domain of citizen healthcare brings with it heightened ethi - cal responsibility when considering the “enormous challenge” [ 39 ] of developing interventions that are politically relevant and sus - tainably beneficial in the long term . Participatory processes and in particular PD are seen to play an important role here , as they promote political engagement , ownership , mutual learning , and development of participants’ skills [ 32 , 53 , 70 , 78 , 85 ] . In particular , the recent shift in PD from a focus on the development of products , to the processes that foster the infrastructuring of publics around matters of concerns [ 21 , 23 ] , is seen as an attempt to renew PD’s original democratic and political aims of supporting power redis - tribution and conflict negotiation - these challenging hegemonic forces in society . This work often favouring social innovation over technology innovation [ 6 , 7 , 21 , 87 ] . More recently , Bødker and Kyng [ 13 ] call for a “new PD” , advocating for collaborations be - tween researchers and publics that enact equitable allocation of power and resources , moving PD to a more political stance . In this regard , emergent research in PD and HCI has looked at the potential of peer - to - peer production such as digital commons as a response to these issues , as well as questions of sustainability [ 32 , 34 , 53 , 76 , 82 , 85 ] . Digital commons - common - pool resources ( CPR ) that share artefacts for communal appropriation - are seen as a potential response to issues of responsibilities tied to the required skills and resources needed to develop and maintain digital innova - tions [ 76 ] . This is because processes of co - creating and sustaining digital commons , termed ‘commoning’ [ 50 , 55 ] , embed upfront in the design process questions of governance that promote sustain - ability . Digital commons are therefore understood as a collective endeavour based on democracy , not hierarchies , serving as a hub for the distribution of social capital [ 41 , 86 ] . A critical aspect of com - moning is that it is not simply about the co - design of the technology itself but also about responding to PD’s original democratic aims , through nurturing processes of considering how technology is to be governed in the short and long run [ 37 ] . This includes the col - lective identification and ownership of risks and co - responsibilities between researchers and participants [ 40 ] , these shifting in scope and ownership as the design progresses from the conceptual to an operating intervention [ 49 ] . While commoning work is arguably emergent in HCI , fewer studies have explored the benefits that such processes can deliver in community healthcare settings . The co - creation of digital com - mons offers the potential for guiding PD practices and collaborative processes that embrace the need for research partnerships with marginalised populations , while attending to questions of sustain - ability and responsible innovation that benefit those they are meant to support . In what follows , we report on a study that explored a collaboration with a public of disabled citizens and unpaid carers , leveraging the remote co - creation of a digital commons that sup - ported their workload of accessing the benefits of self - directed care budgets , extending past design and into a sustainable operation . 3 CASE STUDY : PERSONALISED CARE OF LONG - TERM COMPLEX HEALTH NEEDS IN THE UK Our case study unfolded in the UK , where significant changes in healthcare services for disabled citizens who require 24 / 7 care for their long - term complex health needs , such as profound learning disability , cerebral palsy , genetic disorders , and multiple sclerosis , have taken place over the last ten years . Until recently , disabled citizens’ care was delivered by care agencies funded and commis - sioned by local healthcare authorities . This , however , resulted in a transactional ‘one size fits all’ model of service provision , which had significant shortcomings for disabled citizens and their unpaid carers , evidenced by a lack of choice , control and independent living [ 24 , 58 ] . Recognising these limitations and the demand to better respond to the heterogeneous needs of disabled populations , the UK Na - tional Health Service ( NHS ) has reformed its healthcare system by adopting what is known as a ‘personalised care’ model and para - digm [ 42 ] . This model , also adopted in other countries in the global north , seeks to enable citizens’ choice and control in their lives of care [ 24 ] , where those with complex health needs can arrange their own care through ‘self - directed care budgets’ . These are known as Personal Health Budgets ( PHBs ) in the UK , where the NHS has forecasted 200 , 000 PHBs will be active by 2024 [ 60 ] . The budgets can be handed directly to the disabled citizen or their unpaid carer , often a family member , providing them with agency over their care services . For example , allowing them to recruit paid carers that align with the budget holder’s values , personal preferences , and life choices [ 24 ] . Yet , while the underlying concept of PHBs is well - meaning and motivated , prior research has shown how PHB holders ( disabled citizens or their unpaid carers ) may not achieve the autonomy they seek if the state fails to support them with the responsibilities of management and legal liabilities [ 47 , 66 ] . Similar issues have been found in other countries , where in the name of personalisation , disabled citizens and their unpaid carers are left without support to manage their caregiving duties [ 16 , 17 , 26 ] . 4 APPROACH 4 . 1 Background The study we report on is part of an extended longitudinal research project that began in 2019 . The study was aimed at engaging dis - abled citizens and unpaid carers to explore the challenges that PHB holders were facing and the role of HCI in this space . The initial and primary motivation for conducting the study project stemmed from the lead author’s lived experience in assisting with the management of a PHB for a family member , and informal discussions with other PHB holders . We adopted PD as an approach that incorporates Action Research ( AR ) methodologies [ 1 , p . 277 ] and that seeks to address issues that participants deem significant , with researchers acting as activists on their behalf , while acknowledging the com - plexity of social issues , conflict , and power relations in any design process , as described by Bødker and Kyng [ 13 ] . AR is characterised by open - ended and iterative ‘Plan - Act - Reflect’ cycles , where re - searchers and participants co - devise and deliver interventions or actions in response to a particular context [ 38 ] . Then , reflect on the results of the intervention , and based on these , devise a new action within a subsequent cycle [ 45 ] , aiming towards sustainable change [ 85 ] . We next provide an overview of our first AR cycle , followed by AR cycle 2 which this paper reports on , where we describe its CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Peter Glick and Clara Crivellaro Figure 1 : AR cycles 1 ( previous study ) , 2 ( this paper ) and 3 ( future study ) aims , objectives , and co - design . A third , future , AR cycle , will aim to evaluate the digital commons . See Figure 1 . 4 . 2 AR Cycle 1 Spanning a period of over 18 months , our first AR cycle involved the lead author planning and then recruiting participants - enlisting disabled citizens , unpaid carers , a third sector care organisation , and state healthcare officers . The ‘Act’ stage of this first cycle invited this group to take part in research as active participants within a series of online / offline participatory research engagements . These aimed at uncovering the barriers and challenges they faced when accessing and managing PHBs , and fostering discussion and reflection through the collab - orative analysis of the data gathered . A set of guiding questions were prepared for one - to - one semi - structured interviews , includ - ing , “Can you talk me through the process of gaining and running your PHB” , “What do you need to do to run your PHB ? ” , “Where did you go to get information or support ? ” . The research surfaced complex issues related to power relations at play . Citizens viewed their officers with fear , reporting their care funding being withdrawn without notice ; whilst the healthcare officers believed their actions were justified given their responsibil - ities for public funds . The participatory research also surfaced how PHB holders , while achieving a degree of choice and control over their care , effectively become unpaid ‘managers’ of a residential care home , carrying all the associated burdens and responsibilities , but receiving minimal training or support from their healthcare authorities , impacting on their ability to realise benefits from their PHBs [ 28 ] . 4 . 3 Aims and Objectives of AR Cycle 2 Our AR cycle 1 generated collective understandings and reflection , feeding into AR cycle 2 , which is at the centre of this paper . Here we respond to the first AR cycle by continuing to work with the citizens and the care organisation to co - create digital responses to the critical issues they reported . A key objective was to ensure equity in the engagement process , such that all participants would have opportunities to participate fully in shaping ideas and potential responses . This was challenging as the citizens were time - poor due to their care responsibilities and disabilities , experienced unpredictable lives due to their priorities of care , and were distributed throughout the UK . A second objective was for the process to leverage the personal motivation of partici - pants to co - create a response they deemed worthwhile for them - selves and their peers , this requiring their long - term engagement . A final objective was to foster spaces where participants would feel safe to freely express criticisms of their state’s services and of each other’s views , if they wished to , and to promote their individual opinions , leveraging their implicit and explicit situated knowledge including , but not limited to , their care practice [ 8 , 37 , 88 ] . 4 . 4 Recruitment Our AR cycle 1 and its participatory research generated significant enthusiasm for those involved , who found meaning in the collective process of sharing and understanding common challenges , finding empowerment and peer support , as much as engaging in the re - search [ 28 ] . Because of this , participants wanted to continue to be involved as they were motivated to ‘do something’ about the com - mon issues that emerged from the participatory research . Therefore , all the citizen and third sector participants involved in AR cycle 1 remained involved with the research and this study’s AR cycle 2 . Our participants comprised adult disabled citizens who received PHBs to provide care for themselves , unpaid carers who received these budgets to provide care for their disabled children , and di - rectors of a third sector organisation that specialised in PHBs - one as a disabled citizen ( referenced as such in this study ) and one referenced as third sector staff . Table 1 provides information on participant demographics .

No children or other vulnerable groups took part in this study , easing the approval . Microsoft Forms were used as an online Consent Form , with Participant Information Sheets either emailed as PDFs or hosted on the digital commons . 4 . 6 Positionality As stated , the lead author’s motivation to conduct the research was grounded in direct experience . Hence , his positionality played a role in the recruitment of participants and the building of rapport and understanding in engagements , as he was situated in the con - text characterising the participants’ lives of care [ 37 , 46 , 80 ] . The lead author engaged in reflexive discussions with the second au - thor throughout the longitudinal study , in order to engage critically with his subjectivity and positionality in the research . This acknowl - edging the ‘entanglement’ of a researcher with their communities [ 5 , 22 ] , subjectivity in this study viewed as a positive knowledge resource that is “partial , situated and contextual” [ 11 ] . 4 . 7 Configuring Co - design The objectives described above directed the lead author to configure the participatory design process in ways that would be sensitive to the contextual realities of participants , constrained by the priority of their care , this forming the ‘Plan’ stage of this second AR cycle . Participants found it difficult to travel , either hindered by societal hurdles to disability , or the need to schedule specialist carers for their disabled children , and so could not commit to group session start times due to their care obligations . Therefore , in line with ‘re - spectful design’ as discussed by Rajapakse et al . [ 72 ] , we considered ways to maximise inclusivity and respect through non - traditional engagement methods and tools that supported participation . Our co - design process demanded different tools to enable the dif - fering forms of engagement . The lead author created a set of criteria that allowed for : a range of technical literacy ; smartphone - only us - age , as some participants lacked laptops and tablets ; no large down - loads as older smartphones may not have free capacity and to reduce costs of mobile data ; and re - use of tools for subsequent research . We noted that disabled participants could already access technol - ogy using specialist tools . Open - source tools were sought , but none matched the criteria , hence a fallback of leveraging proprietary tools that were available free of use , either by restricting usage to a free plan or by leaning on their corporate responsibility to provide free access . ‘Collabito’ ( www . collabito . com ) was used for the text - based engagements , ‘ProvenByUsers’ ( www . provenbyusers . com ) for the drag - and - drop sessions , and InVision ( www . invisionapp . com ) for building prototypes . Early in the process , participants raised concerns over the sus - tainability of any interventions they may co - create , with partici - pants suggesting the creation of a “wiki” , a digital common - pool resource ( CPR ) , or the use of available , easy - to - use technologies . Therefore , we considered questions of ethics , accountability , and sustainability as part of the co - design process . Specifically , we sought to incorporate in our process Ostrom’s design principles for the sustainable governance of a commons [ 64 ] , Bettaga et al . ’s [ 5 ] tactics that support digital communing , and responses to Taylor et al . ’s [ 85 ] challenges to sustainability . 4 . 8 Engagements and Co - design We conducted eight distinct design engagements as listed in Table 2 . These engagements , together with our Insights in the following section , are located within the ‘Act’ stage of our second AR cycle . Our Discussions section formed the ‘Reflect’ stage . 4 . 8 . 1 Item 1 – Issues and Responses : Participants were invited to a focus group that extended over 14 days . In the first session of this focus group , participants were presented with ‘scenarios of care’ that the lead author created using data from our AR cycle 1 . Over the 14 - day period , the lead author used data from the on - going discussions to create new scenarios of care and in this way fostered further discussions and helped shape ideas . The new sce - narios included participants’ quotes from discussions , such as , “I can get advice , what I need is stuff done” and “If I did give this work to someone else , they would have to go through one hell of an education programme before they’re able to do it . ” Conversations pointed to a common need of PHB holders for what we term ‘care artefacts’ - documents used to manage the PHB and the paid carers , for ex - ample , staff management , payroll , health and safety , and duties of care ( see Figure 2 ) ; the majority comprised of one - page documents ( see Figure 3 ) , but others , including care plans and staff contracts , extended to 20 pages . The challenge here was a lack of provision from their healthcare authorities , the third sector , commercial or - ganisations , or availability on the internet - requiring each PHB holder to determine the need for each care artefact and then create them without support . An anonymous survey followed this session to capture partici - pants’ reflections on the engagement method . 4 . 8 . 2 Item 2 - Requirements Elicitation : This focus group was con - structed around a care scenario in which participants were encour - aged to reflect on when they first gained their PHB and how an online resource could have most effectively supported them . At this time , a decision was made regarding a name for the digital commons , the lead author suggesting “MyCareBudget” , which was agreed by the participants .

To accomplish this , an online drag - and - drop activity was developed in which participants individually selected each care artefact and dragged it to a category they considered it most closely matched . 4 . 8 . 4 Item 4 - Rapid Prototyping : A clickable , low - fidelity , text - based prototype was created and then discussed in a focus group , with the comments received leading to the building of a graphics - based prototype used as further input to the focus group . 4 . 8 . 5 Item 5 - Gathering of Care Artefacts : All the participants were requested by email to forward the care artefacts they used , regardless of their form – digital , or photographs of handwritten documents . Assurance was given that they would be anonymised . 4 . 8 . 6 Item 6 - Commons Governance : The purpose of this session was to explore governance , with the lead author prompting par - ticipants to discuss issues and mechanisms including conflict res - olution , monitoring , and end - users’ rights . This being a new and abstract subject to the participants , they were sensitised using two drag - and - drop activities in which participants worked alone . The first activity sought to capture end - user roles , entitled “What can users do ? ” , where participants were given end - user actions includ - ing ‘Delete pages’ , ‘Add comments’ , ‘Download’ , to be dragged and dropped over the types of end - users : guests , registered end - users , and administrators . The second activity purposed to elicit reflection on the graduated sanctions [ 64 ] that should be given to end - users when they use MyCareBudget inappropriately or in error , this en - titled “Crime and Punishment” . Participants were presented with possible end - user actions , including “Posting violent or sexual im - ages” , “Continued bad behaviour after a warning” , “Spelling errors” and so on – these to be dragged over the sanctions of “Leave as is” , “No penalty but an administrator is to edit” , “Warn user but no penalty” , and “Block user” . Following the two activities , a focus group discussion took place with the lead author prompting partici - pants to discuss issues and processes of governance , and to consider promotion and maintenance beyond the research process . 4 . 8 . 7 Item 7 - Pre - Deployment Checks : A focus group was hosted with a question that asked , “ You have had a look around the website . What do you think ? Let me know all your negative points please . ” This question specifically asked for their negative comments , as by now there was a sense of community in the group , so there was a need to guard against participants being unwilling to criticise the work of one another . 4 . 8 . 8 Item 8 - Promotion : Twitter was selected to promote My - CareBudget as there were hashtags linked to personalised care , unpaid carers , and healthcare authorities . A Twitter account was established for the project , where the lead author posted tweets highlighting the capabilities of MyCareBudget , with participants then promoting MyCareBudget following a single prompt . Cur - rently ( January 2023 ) , MyCareBudget has been accessed by over 5 , 000 people in its first 16 months , now gaining over 200 people per month , 80 % from the UK and the remainder worldwide . 4 . 9 Data Analysis The 354 textual comments from all the group discussions , outputs from the drag - and - drop activities , the survey , and the care artefacts , were analysed by the lead author using reflexive Thematic Analysis [ 10 ] . This method was selected as the research questions were aimed at actionable outcomes , data was sourced from differing engagement methods , and the sample size was more than ten [ 12 ] . The comments were loaded into NVIVO data analysis software ( www . qsrinternational . com ) , and following a first read - through by the lead author , an initial set of codes was created using open coding . This first set was validated by rereading the comments until no more codes were created .

Of all these themes , the ones that best responded to this paper’s research question were selected : the issues within the practice of managing a PHB ; responses to these issues ; unintended consequences ; and facets of the co - design pro - cess . This initial set of themes was iteratively refined , defined , and validated with the second author until saturation and agreement were reached . 4 . 10 Overview of MyCareBudget MyCareBudget is a digital commons of resources that resembles Wikipedia ( www . wikipedia . org ) in presentation , menus , and navi - gation , as well as compatibility with smartphones , tablets , laptops , and desktops . A difference in use is that Wikipedia’s digital articles are typically found by entering search parameters , whereas the digital resources on MyCareBudget are discovered by browsing , as a newcomer to PHBs is unlikely to know the care artefacts they require . The MyCareBudget homepage reflects this by providing two browsing options : lists of care artefacts for more experienced PHB holders ; and a guided tour for newcomers . After selecting a care artefact , it can be downloaded as a Microsoft Word document , an Adobe PDF , or a link to Google Docs . Figure 4 depicts a partial screenshot of the MyCareBudget page for care artefacts used to log care , showing links to a ‘starting out’ page , accessibility options , and a list of staffing policies .

One concern pertained to the hosting of servers and domain names . Whilst the authors’ university would have provided these by default , the transference to external service providers at the end of the research would have incurred a loss of reputation gained , due to the forced change in the domain name . Hence the lead author used external organisations from the outset . In terms of software used to build and host the website - open - source was purposedly selected [ 5 , 62 ] . MediaWiki ( www . mediawiki . org ) was chosen due to its use for Wikipedia and thousands of other digital commons , with its large support network and corpus of literature . Virtual servers were selected as they can be readily scaled to match traffic demands , this furthering sustainability . The development and operational roles for technical , admin - istrative and support functions during the research were owned by the lead author , as although at least one participant had the skillset required , the tasks would have been a significant demand on their time . Ownership of these tasks following the research was discussed within the commons governance engagement ( see Item 6 above ) . 5 INSIGHTS Our insights describe : ( i ) Personalised Needs and Mutual Aid explor - ing how participants navigated the challenges of personalisation in PHBs and deliberated on how they could support their peers ; ( ii ) Delivering Trustworthy Content exploring participants’ consid - erations of issues of trust for an online resource of care artefacts ; ( iii ) Taking Responsibility describing participants’ concerns on how their innovation could impact their peers , its potential misuse , and sustainability ; ( iv ) Benefits of Participation reports on participants’ perspectives on the benefits of our co - design process . Pseudonyms are used throughout . 5 . 1 Personalised Needs and Mutual Aid At the start of our co - design process , all participants felt free to voice how they had been tasked by their healthcare authorities to recruit and manage a care team , but without training , documentation , or advice . To fill this gap , the majority of participants wished they had received support from their peers , ideally through one - to - one conversations with a peer mentor . Orla , a third sector company director who had sustained a spinal injury in her early twenties , lamented the lack of access to a mentor , “It would have made a big difference to me to have had anyone else [ to ] speak to who had a PHB . . . My [ healthcare authority ] didn’t offer to put me in touch with anyone . ” Yet , in discussions , they each considered such a possibility as unattainable , so they turned to the internet to seek the ‘care arte - facts’ they needed to perform this management . Kayla , a national disability advocate who has a muscle disease , realised that her peers possessed the knowledge on PHBs , the issue was how to access it , “The knowledge is out there , it’s just getting it to the right people in the right way . ” Several participants explained how they searched for , but failed to find care artefacts , which forced them to create these themselves , Kayla continuing with “ . . . I was kind of hoping that I’d be able to find [ care artefacts ] on the internet . . . and that didn’t really exist . ” In this way , a few of the participants began to envisage an online resource for sharing their care artefacts , the first design session acting as a creative space for participants to imagine responses to MyCareBudget : Co - creating a Healthcare Digital Commons CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany their issues with PHBs . A discussion that began with a vague idea for a technology that could hold their working documents , moved on to describe what this technology would need to contain , how it could be accessed , and its functionalities . Amelia , a healthcare professional and parent of a profoundly disabled young adult , was the first to raise the concept , saying , “For me , there should be a piece of technology or a resource somehow , that has all the bits that you need . . . when you’re setting up [ a PHB ] . ” Maria , mother to a child with 24 / 7 physical care needs , put forward that the care artefacts would need to be downloaded to a local device and any changes broadcast , “ . . . downloaded from a regularly updated website , with update alerts to anyone registered . ” Maria’s seemingly unremarkable statement triggered a discus - sion regarding the meaning of taking collective action to provide care artefacts that needed to be individualised for each person – something they considered to be an apparent contradiction . For ex - ample , Amelia considered that , “ . . . [ care artefacts are ] to be adapted for your own needs . ” This discussion took place over several days , the engagement design allowing participants time to reflect and re - spond . Here , participants envisaged their artefacts could be useful as a starting point for their peers , as something they could cus - tomise . They considered how multiple versions of a single type of care artefact could be offered online , showing the variety of ways different people had personalised them . Julie , who has used a wheelchair for over a decade , saw the need for different versions of a care artefact , “I think multiple examples [ of each artefact ] with the pros and cons of each . ” This call for diverse care artefacts was evidenced in the care artefacts sourced from participants , where 13 types of artefacts had up to four versions that differed in style and content . For example , an ‘Accident Log’ varied from documents that asked for a wealth of detail for each accident event , to others that recorded a simple list of events . Thus , in the process of working out how they could respond to the challenges they and their peers face when running a PHB , considering the practicalities of what it should contain , and how it should be delivered , participants reconsidered the value of sharing multiple versions of care artefacts for people to draw from . Concur - rently they reconsidered the value of multiple versions in which care can be performed , and the need to foreground that . Deliberat - ing ideas and options , participants discerned between personalised care and ‘individualised’ need . In the process , catering for mul - tiplicity didn’t seem much of a contradiction but rather a value underpinning their potential design response and collective action . 5 . 2 Delivering Trustworthy Content In the co - design process , initial conversations included consider - ations and discussions over the viability of a potential resource , issues of trust related to the hosting platform , and sources of care artefacts , as well as moderation and presentation of advice . Col - lating and disseminating ‘trustworthy’ content appeared to be a critical aspect of this work , given the potential consequences that ‘harmful’ content could have on the care practices of disabled citi - zens and their unpaid carers . In early discussions , social media was dismissed immediately as a platform through which they could disseminate advice . Participants considered that social media would have demanded significant work to validate content for ‘trustworthiness’ . It was seen as a poor choice as a hosting platform for care artefacts , viewed as a transient medium where documents appeared and disappeared , could only be shared in read - only form , and overall was not considered ‘objective’ . For example , Jasmin , mother of a young adult demanding 24 / 7 care , stated , “I haven’t got enough time to deal with social media . . . seen as what’s posted isn’t fact / law” . Several participants voiced that the artefacts needed to be hosted on an online platform where documents could be stored perma - nently . This in their views , would provide their peers with oppor - tunities to participate in discussions as well as edit , correct and improve artefacts , and , in this way , add value and trust . Colin , a former project manager and now a disability advocate with multiple sclerosis , suggested , “Allow templates to be changeable or added to” , and Amelia “ . . . it would be nice if [ people ] could interact , edit or make suggestions . ” In this way , participants began to see their work as a kind of ‘living archive’ of common - pool resources . Participants also discussed where the care artefacts should come from . They considered their peers as a more trustworthy source of information compared to their local health authorities or other bodies . For example , individuals that would be considered ‘experts’ in this area , including state healthcare authorities , were dismissed due to their lack of accurate , situated knowledge on setting up care infrastructures at home with a PHB . This point being an example of where the citizens’ voices would likely have been inhibited if their health authorities had been present in the design engagements . Instead , those with lived experience of running a PHB were valued as trustworthy . Margot , a healthcare professional and parent of a severely disabled child , said , “Families are the best resource . Having and managing a small budget [ in an organisation ] is very different to employing staff 24 / 7 [ in your home ] . There is a vast amount of information that professionals do not know . ” Having settled on who should contribute care artefacts for public benefits , participants moved on to consider questions of how to maintain trust in such a ‘living archive’ . This led to considerations on the role of moderation of content and input - the ‘commons governance’ drag - and - drop activity designed to achieve just this . It appeared clear that all participants wanted to protect MyCare - Budget from potentially harmful content such as online abuse that they had witnessed on the internet , believing this would demand significant time . Collectively , they decided that those who spammed or posted hate messages were to be permanently blocked as they were viewed as vandals . However , forgiveness was granted to those authoring content that included swearing or venting anger at their healthcare service providers . The participants perhaps recognised this frustration in their own lives or wanted the online space they were creating to also cater for opportunities to discuss broader is - sues in current healthcare provision . In any case , most participants placed little trust in internet users as a population . For example , Amelia suggested that “If you did nothing , I think the usual internet idiots would wreck it . ” Sandra , a third sector director , agreed , seeing moderation as a need , “I do think that having a moderator to monitor content and a way to check anything new before it is published is going to be necessary . ” As to who would perform the moderation , there was agreement that moderators should be their peers , as they would possess the knowledge to verify content . This was also seen as a way of building CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Peter Glick and Clara Crivellaro a community of peer moderators around the care artefacts . Here , Sandra continued with , “ [ Moderators ] need to have good knowledge of Personal Health Budgets , preferably by lived experience of having one . ” Erin , mother to a profoundly disabled teenager needing 24 / 7 care , adding , “Having a democratic moderator system where fellow moderators engage with each other . ” The rapid prototyping design session offered the participants contrasting choices over the look and feel of their website : a simplis - tic text - based version versus a graphics - based version - the differing styles promoting a discussion around ‘trust’ . The graphics - based version was viewed as professional - looking , this denoted commer - cialisation to participants , implying a financial aim underpinning the website , rather one of care . However , they also discussed that the website should not appear too amateurish , as in the text - based version , as that suggested the website had been built lacking care or knowledge , and hence lose trust . Gabrielle , who parented a disabled adult , expressed a need for a balance between care , professionalism , and commercialism , “It’s got to be slick without feeling commercial . ” Thus , during design sessions , participants explored who or what can be considered trustworthy in terms of resources and modera - tion , including the role that aesthetics can play in delivering the ‘right’ message to their communities of peers . 5 . 3 Taking Responsibility Co - creating MyCareBudget offered opportunities for participants to exercise their agency . This in turn generated significant discussions around the responsibilities and risks that come with ‘publicising’ and sharing their care - artefacts online , as well as creating and making visible peer - to - peer communities around PHBs . Participants perceived MyCareBudget as exposing their invisible work to their healthcare authorities , seen as risky to themselves and their peers . For example , they were concerned that ‘showing’ how they manage their PHBs ( for example , how they deal with legal and safeguarding needs or personal choices around staff contracts and safety assessments ) through the sharing of their care artefacts , could offer opportunities for their healthcare authorities to judge their work . The fear here was that their healthcare authorities might eventually demand PHB holders chronicle all aspects of their care , not only imposing institutional - like procedures onto their private homes but exposing the citizens’ private lives to surveillance . Penelope , who was a wheelchair user of 19 years , stated , “ There is the right to not have extra paperwork . To not turn your home into an institution . . . I think the greatest risk is that we create some kind of panopticon in our own homes . ” All participants felt that their PHBs had given them choice and control in managing their care , and they did not want to risk relin - quishing this back to their authorities . This was broadly connected to a lack of understanding and dialogue between state healthcare organisations and PHB holders , as well as power asymmetries at play . This is best encapsulated in Sandra’s statement “ . . . big or - ganisations suck power back . ” However , as discussions unfolded , it appeared that the benefits that MyCareBudget could deliver would offset any potential risk , with participants consciously accepting and embracing the responsibility of creating an online repository . Sandra concluded with , “ . . . it feels like a helpful , informative , useful website is going to outweigh downsides” . Questions and concerns regarding the sustainability of MyCare - Budget were at the forefront of our co - creation process . The com - mons governance session was designed as a focal point for discus - sions on this topic and as part of this , the participants believed that active governance would be essential to achieve sustainability . Even prior to this session , the participants voiced concern about how the care artefacts could be kept up to date with changes such as in employment legislation , Colin stated , “ . . . things change all the time . [ MyCareBudget ] needs to be kept updated . " Looking ahead , they wondered whether the website could be monetised to ensure MyCareBudget longevity , though they questioned whether this would be desirable . Here , Paula , mother to her profoundly disabled son , stated , “I think there should be some kind of money involved , [ governance ] could easily be a full - time job and it seems unfair that disabled people are expected to educate and support without compen - sation . ” Colin disagreed , “For me it’s giving back to the community , so that we all benefit . ” As a response to this discussion around sustainability , the two directors of the third sector organisation who participated in this study offered to both fund and administer MyCareBudget once the research funding ended , seeing the benefits and authority of MyCareBudget arising from it being designed by PHB holders . Orla , one of the directors , stressed its value as a community - led initiative “And we feel that it started off as a user - led project [ so it ] should stay a user - led project . ” These conversations demonstrated that the participants created MyCareBudget as a political act that would support campaigns arguing for more support from their state healthcare organisation . Also as an expression of their lives of care ( and related challenges ) , extending outwards to their unknown peers in a philanthropic sense , owning the risks that their actions would incur . 5 . 4 Benefits of Participation During the commons governance activity , participants reflected on their experiences of co - creating MyCareBudget , unprompted . In these discussions , they considered how the co - design process enabled them to create a community of practice , feeling the process also helped them express and take an activist stance to disseminate knowledge , with a sense of excitement and ownership developing as ideas started to take shape . Several participants found pleasure in co - creating something that would support those who may consider getting a PHB , Amelia saying , “It just feels like a good thing to do , to help make it easier for people coming after you . ” Kayla considered how the co - design process enriched her and the other participants beyond creating something that might benefit society - her social capital had devel - oped in taking part , also seeing this in other participants , saying , “This meets our need to feel productive in society and to expand our knowledge and skills . It has therefore developed us as people . ” Several participants placed themselves back to when they started with a PHB , wishing they had access to MyCareBudget , Margot saying , “I love [ MyCareBudget ] . It would have been so helpful to start with . ” Beyond this , several participants stated that reading how other participants managed their PHBs , helped them improve their own management , and articulate and make sense of their own implicit knowledge . Here , Erin reflected on how the process was “ . . . also a MyCareBudget : Co - creating a Healthcare Digital Commons CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany way of exercising your brain and knowledge which may otherwise be inaccessible . In the case of this PHB project , I feel I’m learning as I contribute . ” A community of action appeared to form early in the co - design process , surfacing a sense of empowerment as the participants were collectively gaining confidence and developing a socio - digital in - novation that could support their peers . Several participants felt strongly about the value of what they were doing as a political act . In this sense , the exclusion of state authorities or officials from the process was considered important , as it enabled their autonomy and reduced dependency on healthcare authorities . In Sandra’s words , “ . . . [ we are ] part of a collective movement , to be more empowered , and less at the mercy of statutory systems . ” Many concurred with Sandra’s statement . Jez , an international disability advocate who had sustained a spinal injury in his late teens , also expressed how the process helped them seek and create meaning , purpose and belief in something beyond their own selves , “Being a part of some - thing bigger than [ our ] selves and wanting to help others go through a slightly better / easier experience than [ we ] may have gone through . ” An anonymous survey took place at the end of the first focus group to elicit responses on the tools and methods , with all par - ticipants welcoming the asynchronous and remote co - design , and appreciating the text - only interactions . Respondent # 1 saying , “I found it an enjoyable experience and probably easier than a face - to - face or Zoom focus group where technical hitches can occur and where commitments at home can mess up the best - laid plans . ” Re - spondent # 2 preferred our non - video method with people they did not know , as it avoided social awkwardness , “With a group that you have never met , I would have been less keen [ on video conferencing ] . ” Our design process and dialogical approach appeared to have enabled the above benefits . In the co - design process , participants felt they could safely criticise both the healthcare services they had received and the comments from their fellow participants , feeling able to share insights about their lived experiences of care and professional careers . 6 DISCUSSION Drawing from our insights and learning gained from the design and delivery of our participatory process , we discuss implications for HCI . We examine the role of HCI in redistributing access to the resources required to support personal healthcare infrastructuring , how co - creating a digital commons can promote responsible digital citizenship , and recommendations to HCI when configuring co - creation with marginalised communities . 6 . 1 Redistributing Access to Healthcare through Infrastructuring During our co - design process , we learnt about the importance of personalised healthcare that can cater for diverse abilities , lifestyles , values , contexts and needs . Given people’s challenges and efforts to connect a siloed set of healthcare service providers , incurring costs of time and stress [ 30 , 31 ] , the co - design process and resulting digital commons illustrated two forms of infrastructuring . Firstly , the digital commons and its care artefacts supported future PHB holders to realise the benefits of PHBs , these arising from choice and control in their lives of care [ 24 ] . Secondly , the design process enabled the bringing together of a group of citizens to form a ‘public of action’ around common issues – much in line with the infrastructuring discussed by Le Dantec and DiSalvo [ 21 ] and others [ 20 , 89 ] . Yet our co - design process was less about the “discovery of unknown issues” [ 21 ] – rather it served to create spaces where issues which were felt as an individualised struggle could be safely voiced , to enable the surfacing and discovery of common , collective issues , which our participants and lead author wanted to redress as mutual aid . As Spade described [ 78 ] , mutual aid exposes gaps and failings in the system , illustrating how personal health budgets within the UK neoliberal healthcare system have materialised into an ‘individualised’ matter , where responsibility for care work is offloaded onto the individual , becoming invisible , with the state providing only minimal support . Previous work on infrastructuring has shown the benefits and tensions of supporting socio - material relations and collaborative dialogue between civics , public institutions , and authorities [ 61 , 65 ] . In this study , local health authorities were excluded due to the worries voiced by our participants – these insights developed in our previous AR cycle that highlighted unpaid carers’ fears of retaliation for speaking up , with the risk of losing their care funding [ 28 ] . Further , participants sharing their care - artefacts and hence making their work visible to healthcare authorities was a source of worries and anxiety for our participants . These tensions are not uncommon – for example , even when risks are less personal as in highway maintenance , Harding et al . [ 36 ] reported how citizens felt fear and vulnerability when providing information to their civic authorities . The authorities’ exclusion from this study was both productive and a missed opportunity . Productive , as it enabled us to create safe design spaces for our participants to connect to one another and gain social capital , expertise ( evidenced by the way they spoke about the process ) , and ultimately co - create a digital resource that over 5 , 000 people around the world currently use . A missed opportunity , as the officers’ presence may have invigorated dialogical spaces – in the way that other research within HCI and beyond have described [ 2 , 61 , 65 ] — where co - creative dialogue between civics and author - ities can end “cycles of hostility” through improved communication [ 65 ] ; it can also help sensitise frontline civic officers to the needs and desires of citizens [ 61 ] . Yet , opening discursive spaces that can lessen the ‘distance’ between citizens and institutions brings signif - icant risks arising from the uneven power dynamics . Björgvinsson characterised this risk as “research responsibilities” [ 7 ] that includes researchers’ abilities to foster agonistic public spaces but also to protect the people within these spaces . We believe that creating safe design spaces for our participants ultimately delivered the greater benefit in our context , as our par - ticipants were empowered by the possibility of helping their future peers . MyCareBudget enacted a start of a societal reconfiguration – in the manner that Le Dantec and DiSalvo discuss [ 21 ] . However , this benefit was at the expense of broader systemic service transfor - mation , in that MyCareBudget addressed immediate needs , rather than more profound systemic issues within the broader landscape of neoliberal care service provision in the global north . This points to the challenges of fostering broader systemic change , more so where priorities in healthcare are driven by profit rather than public well - being and public value . Paradoxically , by reducing dependence on an absent state , MyCareBudget could be at risk of justifying and CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Peter Glick and Clara Crivellaro reinforcing their absence ( the status quo ) [ 78 ] . Our hope is that the visibility of what the state is not providing will generate insights and accountability in this regard . We have located this study in the UK , with its free access to healthcare , but see transferability based on the global healthcare infrastructuring work of HCI authors [ 16 , 17 ] . For example , Gui and Chen [ 30 ] described a similar neoliberalist offloading in the US , where the authors reported on the healthcare industry who “secretly move the burden of labor onto individual health consumers” . Future work within HCI could explore how community - led in - novation can respond to current injustices in healthcare provision and infrastructures , while being mindful of the complex power dynamics at play . Clearly , working towards social justice goals for disabled citizens demands the transformation of the institutions that deliver their services . As a response to this , the lead author is planning a future , fourth , AR cycle to work in collaboration with citizens , third sector organisations , and healthcare authorities . We see technology playing a role here , potentially allowing the citizen to be distant yet involved in conversations . The implications of this approach delivering insights into how HCI can support citizens to engage with their civic and state when adversarial relationships exist . 6 . 2 Nurturing Responsible Digital Citizenship through Co - creating Sustainable Digital Commons In our co - design process , responsibilities for our socio - technical intervention ( its design , deployment , publicity , and maintenance ) were shared between researchers , the participants , and the third sector organisation collaborating with us . Through the collabo - ration , we came to appreciate the relationship between trust and responsibility — where trust manifested as less a matter of shared responsibility between parties , and more about a process of becom - ing together . In turn , responsibility emerged as a matter that is co - constructed and defined within a collective of interdependent individuals . Our participants have created a digital commons where they took responsibility for caring for one another and change polit - ical conditions by building relationships that were more ‘survivable’ [ 78 ] . In the process , responsibility shifted dynamically between re - searcher and participants - and on to their unknown peers who form the imagined future beneficiaries and contributors of MyCareBud - get . Our participants took responsibility for sharing their multiple care artefacts but also recognised their unknown peers’ responsi - bilities to personalise them . This view on trust and responsibility extends Jansen et al . ’s study [ 40 ] of healthcare responsibilities be - tween patient , clinician and technology , where co - responsibility is discussed as more static and simply assigned to people ; and Karasti’s and Baker’s work [ 43 ] that describes how participants take collective responsibility when their decisions impact on their communities . Responsibility for the sustainability of the intervention was seen as critical by both researchers and participants from the concep - tion of this study . Participants were concerned about who would update and maintain the resource . Researchers had an ethical im - perative that any intervention delivering value to the lives of this marginalised and underserved population , must not be withdrawn as the research funding ends . HCI authors have written on the criticality of sustainability in our interventions , seeing the design methods to achieve this being fundamental to PD , deeming it in - sufficient to just ‘abandon’ technology in its context , no matter its worth [ 34 ] . Taylor et al . [ 85 ] also explored this issue , adamant that researchers own the responsibility to at least examine the potential for sustainability , the authors recognising challenges of resource , usage , and technology . In response to these challenges , we adopted a low - cost operational model , leveraged a digital commons for its openness to content generation , and used open - source software to promote stability . However , as stated by Manuel and Crivellaro [ 53 ] and Hamm et al . [ 32 ] , the use of open - source software cannot imply that non - technical citizens have the ability to update it . The skill set demanded impedes accessibility to perform online edits , delimiting the ownership of such public technology by citizens and their communities . We join the call from Manuel and Crivellaro for HCI to develop open - source software that is more widely accessible to those with low IT skills . We are conscious that opting for a more sustainable option for our participants came with trade - offs between social innovation against technical innovation , as discussed by Björgvinsson et al . , Le Dantec and Carl DiSalvo , and Teli et al . [ 7 , 21 , 87 ] . Others have acknowledged digital commons often entail the same trade - off [ 35 , 44 ] . In HCI , Teli and colleagues [ 86 , 87 ] detail the value of co - creating commons as a collaborative production , or as described by Bødker and Kyng [ 13 ] - “democratic control of IT” . From our study , we see sustainability in social innovation outweighing that of technical innovation . Further , as a digital commons , the intervention excludes by de - fault those without internet access , the authors seeing value in face - to - face engagements once COVID - 19 permits access to these populations who are at high risk of infection . Our process was conceived to maximise our participants’ agency and sustainability - to avoid potentially harmful consequences that may come from delivering a short - lived digital innovation . We also witnessed the use of a digital commons as a novel way of distribut - ing the resources of our participants and their peers , as a collective response to care for one another . This use of a digital commons allows for scaling out of this mutual aid to a wider population [ 33 , 54 ] , whereby the care artefacts are intended to be changed to suit individuals whether they are funded by PHBs in the UK , or their equivalents in other nations - evidenced by the worldwide use of MyCareBudget . 6 . 3 Configuring Co - creation with Marginalised Communities HCI has developed important methodological considerations when co - researching with marginalised populations [ 2 , 56 , 68 , 72 , 83 ] . Researchers have foregrounded how PD processes are usually pred - icated and configured with particular populations in mind , typically eloquent , affluent and from privileged backgrounds [ 37 ] . Thus , re - searchers have called for the inclusion of those less privileged , and more specifically , for closer collaborations with disabled popula - tions [ 37 , 79 ] . MyCareBudget : Co - creating a Healthcare Digital Commons CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Our co - design process was configured from a disability justice approach , to deliver access , inclusion , equity , and meaningful par - ticipation . This was achieved by configuring engagements from the outset , utilising the authors’ skills in research methods to leverage the participants’ whole - life expertise [ 3 , 88 ] , whilst promoting their agency to ensure they could participate in developing responses [ 27 ] . Further , we adopted Bettega et al . ’s [ 5 ] five tactics that support digital commoning : foster self - reflection in participants ; understand and respond to needs ; respond to participants as a group ; problema - tise the standard toolset ; and offer technologies suited to average capabilities . A temporal configuration of our engagements meant that sessions spanned between 7 to 14 days and were conducted asyn - chronously . This allowed participants to participate at their conve - nience and without time constraints , over several days , allowing them to evaluate their own comments and those from others , care - fully . Yet , the delivery of the process required significant efforts from the lead researcher , who felt responsible to attend all the extended sessions throughout the day and evening . Furthermore , the dialogical nature of the design of the sessions – whereby the lead researcher would analyse data from discussions to construct scenarios to promote further discussions in the following sessions , added further pressure . Future work would benefit from consider - ing the advantages of a temporal configuration of engagements , however , this would have to be carefully considered to mitigate against participants losing focus , and stress on the researchers . We considered how a spatial configuration of our engagements could mitigate barriers to participation including participants’ time - poor lives and their financial and mobility issues . We configured our engagement to be entirely remote , with input as typed or mouse - driven format and no video meetings . This appeared to be received positively by most participants – removing the social awkwardness that can arise in video calls . However , our overriding concerns regarding the participants’ time - poor lives meant we missed oppor - tunities for synchronous , discursive sessions . Future research might consider a mixed approach of remote asynchronous sessions that allow people the time to reflect and consider their own and other comments , interspersed by face - to - face video conferencing that supports small groups’ discussion and feedback . Yet , as reported in this paper , we struggled to find open - source design tools that would suitably cater for our process and that would work for our participants . Hence , future research should also look to develop tools that respond to marginalised populations’ needs and require - ments , leveraging open - source software for commoning [ 55 , 86 ] and making them widely available , thus removing financial barriers and aligning with the community - driven ethos of digital commons . Finding appropriate ways to challenge participants step - by - step . In our study we exposed our participants to unfamiliar designs and technologies such as online bulletin boards and drag - and - drop activities , but also unfamiliar concepts , for example , the governance of a digital commons . In this sense , we have configured our participatory process in ways that gradually challenged our participants ‘step - by - step’ over the course of the engagements . This careful configuration sensitised participants to use the tools as they gradually gained confidence and proficiency . Thus , besides attend - ing to the “ average capability of the group members” as Bettega et al . put it [ 5 ] , we recommend future work in this space to consider how exposing participants to gradual , appropriate , and carefully planned technical and conceptual challenges can ultimately be more productive in the course of co - design . A safe and respectful configuration . Considerations of safety are essential when conducting work with marginalised populations [ 7 ] . As discussed above , excluding healthcare officers promoted participants’ emotional well - being and enabled the voicing of ser - vice issues without fear of reprisal . Insights from months of prior work ( AR cycle 1 ) and the positionality of the lead author , meant we were aware of the anxiety and stress that the presence of au - thorities would have caused . We respected and carefully attended to participants’ unpredictable lives arising from their priorities of care , and their associated barriers to participation in face - to - face workshops and other group activities [ 30 , 68 , 72 ] . While the lead author’s positionality may have played a role in accelerating trust building and understanding the complexities of our participants’ lives – we invite other researchers working in this space to ensure they have an in - depth comprehension of the political and power dynamics at play , supported by disabled citizens and unpaid car - ers as collaborators in the research , before crafting participatory spaces . Participants’ continued participation in the shaping of the direc - tions of this study , their increased social capital , enthusiasm and rich output generated from the engagements , and that thousands of people have accessed MyCareBudget since its deployment , shows this work is clearly critical and valuable , and is clear evidence of the success of our configuration . More broadly , we believe future work should consider the methods , tools and configurations we developed in this study , further configuring them in ways that cater for diverse populations , abilities and complex lifestyles in order to foster and ensure meaningful participation . 7 CONCLUSION We collaborated in Participatory Design with disabled citizens , un - paid carers and a care organisation to deliver a sustainable social innovation in the form of a digital commons . This commons cur - rently supports personal healthcare infrastructures to over 5 , 000 people worldwide , growing by 200 each month . The co - design pro - cess delivered insights that exposed issues of trust , ownership and distribution of responsibility , pointing to the benefits and chal - lenges of this approach for value and sustainability , and for the participants’ benefits . These have significance due to the increasing numbers of unpaid carers , the rising popularity of Personal Health Budgets and their self - directed care budget equivalents throughout the global north . Our case study responded to the call from Bødker and Kyng for a more activist stance for Participatory Design , by involving our participants as partners , addressing “the Big Issues” of importance to our participants , and for sustainable democratic control over technology , whilst ensuring their safe participation . The insights further contribute novel configurations of methods and tools for HCI to research alongside underserved and marginalised popu - lations , offering co - design implications for a sustainable digital commons that provides for democracy in both its design and as an intervention . We add to the corpus of HCI literature that leverages CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Peter Glick and Clara Crivellaro Participatory Design to deliver social justice for disabled communi - ties , working alongside participants in the spirit of “Nothing About Us , Without Us” .
