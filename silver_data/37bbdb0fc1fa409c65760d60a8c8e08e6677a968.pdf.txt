KEY WORDS : reproductive cloning ; therapeutic cloning ; diag - nostic cloning ; pharmaceutical cloning ; mammalian embryo ; trans - genetics ; assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) . INTRODUCTION The concept of “cloning” comes originally from the Greek and in the medical sense means asexual gen - eration , that means copying of the same individuals , reproduction of the same cells , same molecules and thus of the same living beings . The concept of cloning applies to uni - cellular organisms , plants , animals , and to human beings as well . Cloned siblings can only be either all females or all males , and are of the same sex as the donor . Monozygotes , that is , twins or multi - ple siblings arising from a single fertilized egg cell are considered human clones that nature itself is creating , although very rarely . CLONING AND REPRODUCTION From a biological and technical point of view , the cloning of mammals—unlike in plants—cannot be es - 1 Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics , University of Innsbruck , Anichstrasse 35 , A - 6020 , Innsbruck , Austria ; e - mail : johanna . ulmer @ uibk . ac . at tablished exclusively from individual somatic cells in order to create directly from these cells a living being . In mammals , cloning requires the egg cell or oocyte and early blastomeres ( embryonic cells ) . So far , only these cells are in a position to ensure the origin of mammalian life . The nuclear genome must be re - moved from the egg cell , thus being “enucleated” by microsurgical procedure . What remains is the cyto - plasmic envelope of this egg cell into which the nu - cleus from an embryonic or adult cell is transferred by different methods . The cloning procedure can be repeated several times . In mammals , one of the lim - iting factors is the small number of oocytes available . Enucleated oocytes with donor genomes can be cultured in vitro for several days . The cloned embryos are then implanted in the uterus of surrogate females . The surrogate mothers give birth to offspring which are genetically identical with the original donor cells . Reproductive cloning in mammalian animals can be traced back to 1981 when such experiments were performed successfully in mice using embryonic cell nuclei from the inner cell mass of blastocysts for their tranplantation into enucleated egg cells ( 1 ) . At that time , this discovery sparked a worldwide dispute with arguments for and against cloning . In 1984 , further ex - periments on cloning mice with embryonic cells as nu - clear donors from preimplantation stages gave nega - tive results . For this reason , the authors argued against the feasibility of cloning mammals via nuclear trans - plantation , concluded that “the cloning of mammals by simple nuclear transfer is biologically impossible” and ﬁnally hypothesized that “the inability of cell nu - clei from these stages ( preimplantation ) to support development reﬂects rapid loss of totipotency” ( 2 ) . These negative ﬁndings inﬂuenced profoundly and stagnated temporarily further progress in the ﬁeld of reproductive cloning . “Many people were deterred by this statement from pursuing mammalian cloning further” ( 3 ) . In 1986 , however , cloned sheep that derived from embryonic cell nuclei transferred into 451 1058 - 0468 / 01 / 0800 - 0451 $ 19 . 50 / 0 C (cid:176) 2001 PlenumPublishingCorporation P1 : VENDOR / GDW / GOQ / GEE P2 : LMD / QC : GCQ Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics PP196 - 341682 July 14 , 2001 17 : 8 Style ﬁle version Oct . 14 , 2000 452 ILLMENSEE enucleated oocytes demonstrated very impressively the applicability of cloning procedures for farm ani - mals ( 4 ) . Consequently , in 1987 , reproductive cloning procedures have been introduced to bovines ( 5 ) ; in 1989 , to pigs ( 6 ) ; and in 1991 , to goats ( 7 ) . Since then , steady progress in improving the cloning pro - cedures has been achieved by the use of unfertil - ized and activated oocytes rather than fertilized egg cells , by the application of electrofusion for transfer of donor cell nuclei instead of their microsurgical injection into enucleated oocytes and by modiﬁca - tion of culture medium and culture conditions for in vitro growth of cloned preimplantation embryos . In addition , furtherprogressinmicrosurgicalprocedures Fig . 1 . During the period of preimplantation development in vitro , the mammalian egg and embryo up to the blastocyst stage is amenable to multiple microsurgical , biomole - cular , and diagnostic interventions . on mammalian preimplantation embryos has opened up new avenues for a wide range of applications in reproductive medicine ( Fig . 1 ) . In 1993 , cloning of human embryos was initiated via embryo splitting into individual blastomeres ( 8 ) . For their protection these early embryonic cells were sur - rounded by Na - alginate , a polysaccharide , as artiﬁcial zona pellucida . The individual blastomeres divided and developed further into morula - like structures during a few days in culture . These cloning exper - iments were carried out with nonviable , chromoso - mally abnormal ( triploid ) human embryos obtained rarely after in vitro fertilization in assisted repro - duction programs .

Mammalian embryos at the 2 - to 4 - cell stage can be divided into individual blastomeres for their further development into cloned ( monozygotic ) embryos for the purpose of uterine transfer , biochemical analysis , karyotyping , and cryoprotection , as well as stem cell engineering . splitting following in vitro fertilization implies sev - eral novel and adventageous options . One embryo can be taken for uterine transfer whereas its cloned twin embryo can be cryopreserved for future stem cell production or another uterine transfer . The twin embryo may also be examined molecularly and cyto - genetically for genetic and chromosomal anomalies or for its sex ( Fig . 2 ) . Furthermore , a combination of reproductive cloning procedures may be envisaged by creating—through nuclear transfer from a donor cell into an enucleated oocyte—a cloned early em - bryo and then splitting it to obtain multiple cloned embryos . Future application of such technology to human reproduction remains extremely controversial from a scientiﬁc and ethical point of view . Let us return to the history of mammalian cloning . In 1993 , the birth of mice was reported following transplantation of early cell - cycle stage embryonic nuclei into enucleated oocytes ( 9 ) . In 1994 , the ﬁrst cloned calves originated from bovine inner cell mass cells as donor nuclei ( 10 ) . In 1996 , sheep were cloned by nuclear transfer from cells of a cultured cell line ( 11 ) . In 1997 , the same Scotish research group re - ported the birth of a mammal cloned for the ﬁrst time from a somatic cell of an adult animal ( 12 ) . The cloned sheep “Dolly” originated genetically from an ewe’s udder cell . In the meantime , Dolly has given birth to viable and healthy offspring . Also in 1997 , cloned lambs were produced from an established embryonic cell line using its cells as nuclear donors between pas - sages 8 and 16 of in vitro culture ( 13 ) . In the same year , rhesus monkeys were cloned from embryonic stem cells functioning as nuclear donors ( 14 ) . In 1998 , it was reported in mice that embryonic cell nuclei from the inner cell mass and trophoblast were able to induce development in enucleated oocytes and promote dif - ferentiation up to the adult stage ( 15 ) . Again in 1998 , the same Japanese research group reported that eight cloned calves were born and originated from somatic cells of a single cow ( 16 ) . Most impressively out of 10 embryos transferred to uteri of surrogate cows eight calves were born viable and normal . Three of them derived from oviductal cells and ﬁve of them from cumulus cells . In the same year , similar results were obtainedinmiceusingsuccessfullyadultcumuluscells as nuclear donors for cloning adult murine offspring Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics , Vol . 18 , No . 8 , 2001 P1 : VENDOR / GDW / GOQ / GEE P2 : LMD / QC : GCQ Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics PP196 - 341682 July 14 , 2001 17 : 8 Style ﬁle version Oct . 14 , 2000 454 ILLMENSEE ( 17 ) . These results in sheep , bovines , and mice clearly demonstrated that nuclei from some adult cells retain their full genetic potential to bring about develop - ment of viable offspring . In 1999 , the ﬁrst interspecies mammalian embryos were cloned ( 18 ) . Skin ﬁbroblast cells from cattle , sheep , pig , monkey , and rat were used as sources of donor nuclei for their transplantation into enu - cleated bovine oocytes . Although some of the inter - species karyo - cytoplasmic hybrids developed into late preimplantation embryos and induced preg - nancies in surrogate females , none of them ad - vanced to fetal stages . Nevertheless , these ﬁrst at - tempts to create interspecies clones document that early developmental mechanisms underlying and regulating early embryogenesis seem to be conserved among mammalian species . Future application of closely related mammalian interspecies cloning might be envisaged to substantially help saving or recreating endangered or almost extinct mammalian species . At the beginning of 2000 , results were published on the cloning of calves derived from nuclei of adult ﬁbroblast cells cultured in vitro for 3 months ( 19 ) . These cells , when cultured over such a long period of time , still maintained their normal ( diploid ) set of chromosomes . This represented a signiﬁcant progress for cloning procedures with established cell cultures . One caveat for the use of cultured cells in reproduc - tive cloning is linked to the ﬁnite number of mitotic cell divisions leading to replicative senescence . It was proposed that among other factors the shortening of telomeres at the end of chromosomes is respon - sible for cellular aging and is causing chromosomal rearrangement ( 20 ) . Usually , the length of telomeric TTAGGG repeats is controlled and maintained by telomerase , a reverse transcriptase , by the telomeric protein TRF1 and tankyrase , a poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( 21 , 22 ) . In recent experiments on human cell cultures , it was impressively demonstrated that after transfecting cells with human catalytic telomerase , chromosomal ends became extended by their telomeric repeats resulting in cells that continued to devide and exceeded their normal lifespan by at least 20 additional doublings ( 23 ) . As pointed out for future opportunities in therapeutic medicine , the ability to rejuvenate human cells with telomerase may provide new applications in the context of therapeutic cloning . It is important to mention that the rate of success for viable adult mammalian clones using adult cells as nuclear donors is rather low and usually does not ex - ceed 8 % . Further insight into the complex biological and molecular interactions between donor cell and re - cipient egg cytoplasm following nuclear transfer into enucleatedooplastsormitoticcytoplastsisrequiredtoimprovereproductivecloning ( 24 ) . In this respect sev - eral criteria such as karyoplast – cytoplast volume ratio ( 25 ) , remodelling of transplanted donor nuclei under the inﬂuence of recipient cytoplasm and its effect on reprograming the donor genome ( 26 , 27 ) , coordina - tion of cell cycle and expression of its control proteins ( 28 , 29 ) are of utmost importance for the outcome of cloning . Recently , modiﬁed culture conditions for donor cells as well as cloned embryos have shown to profoundly inﬂuence the cloning efﬁciency . It has been proposed that sheep donor cells arrested and synchronized in GO phase of the mitotic cell cycle via serum starvation may provide a more efﬁcient source of cells for nuclear transfer due to a more readily fa - cilitated reprograming of the nuclear genome in egg cytoplasm ( 30 ) . In comparative cloning studies using either starved or nonstarved bovine ﬁbroblast cells , it was found that nuclei from starved donor cells sup - ported signiﬁcantly better the development of cloned embryos when compared with those from nonstarved cells , thus leading to higher pregnancy rates ( 31 ) . In addition , cloning efﬁciency could be increased by us - ing the cloned bovine embryos for another recloning procedure . Along these lines it was shown in goat that several recloning events using early embryonic cell nuclei from already cloned embryos for another trans - fer into enucleated oocytes improved signiﬁcantly the developmental potential of cloned embryos up to the adult stage ( 32 ) . By applying this cloning technique the authors reported the birth of 45 normal goats de - rived from 141 serially cloned embryos , a truly impres - sive result . Historically speaking , such serial nuclear transfers have been successfully pioneered in cloning experiments of Amphibia ( 33 ) . The biological effects of mitochondrial contri - butions from recipient egg cytoplasm and nuclear donor cell on further development have so far rarely been investigated on cloned domestic animals . It has been suggested that mitochondrial heteroplasmy may be partially responsible for the elevated death rate in animal clones . Interestingly , quite variable and unpredictable proportions of mitochondrial heteroplasmy was recently reported for the recipient to donor mtDNA ratio in healthy cloned calves , ranging from about 0 . 4 to 4 % with respect to donor mtDNA contributions , utilizing allele - speciﬁc nu - cleotide polymorphism to distinguish between both Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics , Vol . 18 , No . 8 , 2001 P1 : VENDOR / GDW / GOQ / GEE P2 : LMD / QC : GCQ Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics PP196 - 341682 July 14 , 2001 17 : 8 Style ﬁle version Oct . 14 , 2000 CLONING IN REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE 455 mtDNAs ( 34 ) . These results clearly demonstrate that mitochondrial heteroplasmy does not neces - sarily impede normal mammalian development . In other investigations , mitochondrial homoplasmy was revealed in several cloned sheep that contained exclusively mtDNA from the recipient egg cytoplast and none of the mtDNA from the nuclear donor cell ( 35 ) . The molecular events leading to such preferential mtDNA loss during cloning are still unknown . It was proposed that multiple passaging of donor cells during their in vitro culture may cause a continuous depletion of mtDNA . However , the process of loosing mtDNA of the donor cell type is not comparable to the process proposed to exclude sperm - derived mtDNA during fertilization ( 36 ) . Several factors at risk have been associated with in vitro culture and reproductive cloning of embryos from domestic animals ( 37 ) . Immunohistochemical and cytogenetic studies on in vitro - cultured cattle and swine embryos showed a high incidence of develop - mental aberrations in comparison to in vivo devel - opment , thus signaling adverse effects of the in vitro procedures ( 38 ) . Culture conditions have shown to profoundly inﬂuence the developmental behavior of sheepandbovineembryosculturedinvitroforseveraldays . After their uterine transfer some of them gave rise to fetal oversize ( 39 , 40 ) . Similarly , some of the embryos from these farm animals when co - cultured with somatic cells for several days again developed into large - sized fetuses ( 41 ) . When sheep and bovine embryos were cultured in medium supplemented with human serum and then transferred in uteri , a signiﬁ - cant incidence of fetal and placental anomalies , dys - tocia and neonatal death , limb deformation , and or - gan dysfunction was observed in the resulting large offspring ( 42 ) . Furthermore , postnatal growth lead - ing to large offspring ( LO syndrome ) was reported to be greater in sheep originating from embryo cul - ture including serum in comparison to naturally - bred controls ( 43 ) . Morphological investigations on some of the cultured embryos have revealed structural changes at the cellular level ( 44 ) as well as alterations in their kinetics of development ( 45 ) . It has been ar - gued that embryonic abnormalities due to in vitro culture and developmental asynchrony between the transferred embryo and the uterine environment are causing elevated abortion rates . Consequently , cul - ture conditions had been modiﬁed and improved to reduce or avoid some of these detrimental effects on fetal and postnatal development ( 46 ) . It should be emphasized that comparable pre - or postnatal devel - opment malformations and increased abortion rates have not been observed in human assisted reproduc - tion , neither in IVF nor ICSI ( 47 ) . Analogously and in this context , another example of discrepancy is re - ferring to progesterone treatment for sustaining uter - ine embryo implantation in reproduction . Whereas in sheep , administeredprogesteroneduringtheﬁrstdays of pregnancy triggered enhanced fetal growth ( 48 ) , such effects have not been observed during human fe - tal life despite the fact that progesterone is routinely administered to patients in assisted reproduction to improve uterine implantation after embryo transfer . Concerning risk factors related to reproductive cloning of farm animals ( Fig . 3 ) , it was reported from several groups that a signiﬁcant proportion of cloned offspring showed abnormally elevated birth weights leading to the so - called large offspring ( LO ) syn - drome ( 49 , 50 ) . However , the incidence of this syn - drome remains neither predictable nor reproducible . Among other biological parameters such as devel - opmental asynchrony between the cloned embryo and the uterine environment , nonphysiological em - bryo culture conditions seem to be associated with and responsible for the LO syndrome . An increased rate of joint and limb abnormalities was seen on cloned animals with LO syndrome , most likely due to the oversize of fetuses that were cramped in uteri . Fetal overgrowth might also result from al - tered expression of imprinted genes ( 51 ) . However , the molecular mechanism underlying the LO syn - drome in assisted animal reproduction is not analo - gous to human fetal overgrowth accompanied with the Beckwith – Wiedemann syndrome ( 52 ) . Inappropriate culture conditions for some livestock embryos may cause epigenetic changes in genomic imprinting , thus leading to developmental anomalies . Similar for cloning procedures , inappropriate culture conditions for somatic donor cells and inefﬁcient re - programing of nuclear donor genome in recipient egg cytoplasm may lead to long - lasting epigenetic changes in gene expression . Recently , it was demonstrated in sheep that LO fetuses showed a signiﬁcantly reduced expression of IGF2R concomitantly associated with reduced methylation ( 53 ) . In particular , IGF2R ex - pression in various tissues of LO fetuses was reduced by 30 – 60 % in comparison to tissues from normal fe - tuses . Complete loss of methylation of the second in - tron ( DMR2 ) region was found in most of the LO fetuses . Loss of DMR2 methylation in mice is causing a comparable reduction in IGF2R expression with a similar overgrowth phenotype , most likely induced by Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics , Vol . 18 , No . 8 , 2001 P1 : VENDOR / GDW / GOQ / GEE P2 : LMD / QC : GCQ Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics PP196 - 341682 July 14 , 2001 17 : 8 Style ﬁle version Oct . 14 , 2000 456 ILLMENSEE Fig . 3 . Presumed factors at risk that may cause detrimental effects on normal develop - ment of cloned mammals . increased circulating levels of IGF2 ( 54 ) . Biomedical studies on some newborn domestic clones with phe - notypic alterations led to the assumption that most likely organic abnormalities of energy metabolism in uteri had created abnormal fetal growth and poor physiological conditions for extrauterine life . It has been suggested that the metabolic dysfunctions ob - served in some of the cloned siblings may result from deleterious adaptations of the conceptus to abnormal placentalfunctionsandanomaliesinplacentalsize . As a consequence of this , elevated rates of late abortion , perinatal mortality and early postnatal death has been associated with the cloning of domestic animals . Or - ganic defects such as heart and liver failures , cerebel - lar and lymphoid hypoplasia were diagnosed on some cloned livestock ( 55 ) . Until now it is still unclear and unsolved to what extent various embryo culture con - ditions , embryo cloning procedures , embryo transfer techniques , somatic donor cell treatment , and cell cul - ture from adult tissue are causally related to artiﬁcial genomic imprinting and to particular developmental failures observed in domestic animal cloning . It is puzzling to observe in the farm animal system accumulated fetal and adult malformations including the LO syndrome after embryo culture in medium supplemented with serum and / or co - culture with feeder cells . Further research is needed to re - veal plausible mechanisms for understanding and di - agnosing these developmental anomalies observed in some livestock offspring . Recent improvements in hu - man embryo culture using modiﬁed and serum - free media enhanced impressively the growth rate of hu - man embryos up to the blastocyst stage ( 56 ) . In ad - dition it was found that changing the medium during human embryo culture further improved the results in vitro , thereby adopting effectively the respective Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics , Vol . 18 , No . 8 , 2001 P1 : VENDOR / GDW / GOQ / GEE P2 : LMD / QC : GCQ Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics PP196 - 341682 July 14 , 2001 17 : 8 Style ﬁle version Oct . 14 , 2000 CLONING IN REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE 457 and sequential medium to the different physiological conditions required for embryonic growth ( 57 ) . This seems rather logical because during development in vivo , the embryo is getting exposed to different nu - tritional environments during its migration from the oviduct to the uterus . It should again be reinforced that during all the past years of worldwide human embryo culture for assisted reproduction , no ele - vated developmental abnormalities have been ob - served in the newborn IVF or ICSI offspring be - yond and above the usual rate generally obtained among spontaneously born infants . It is therefore cur - rently neither appropriate nor justiﬁed to extrapolate possible culture - induced fetal and adult malforma - tions in farm animals to the human system . A pos - sible extension of reproductive cloning to humans , however , seems highly controversial for biological and ethical reasons and is currently under worldwide debate . CLONING AND THERAPY Recently , it has become possible to successfully cul - ture embryonic cells from 5 to 6 days old human preimplantation embryos and primordial germ cells from 5 to 9 weeks old human embryos in suitable nu - tritional media ( 58 ) . Embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and primordial germ ( PG ) cells remain diploid and con - serve their embryonic and proliferative characteris - tics over many cell divisions in culture . ES cells are derivedfromtheinnercellmass ( ICM ) ofculturedhu - man blastocysts produced by in vitro fertilization for clinicalpurposesinassistedreproductionanddonatedbypatients . When blastocysts hatch from the zona pel - lucida and outgrow with their externally surrounding trophoblast cells , internal clusters of ICM cells can be isolated and cultured separately . Human ES cell lines can be established by selecting and expanding indi - vidual ICM colonies of uniform and undifferentiated morphology . Human embryo - derived ES cells may be employed for future therapeutic purposes to reconsti - tute defective organ systems since they are capable of differentiating into a variety of tissues and possess a largeregenerativepotential . Therapeuticcloningwith the aid of assisted reproduction technologies for the extraction and expansion of human ES cells will open up novel and quite controversial applicabilities for transplantation medicine . Therapeutic cloning may be performed by utilizing donated preimplantation embryos from IVF and ICSI programs ( Fig . 4 ) or by creating embryos via nuclear transfer from patients’ somatic cells into enucleated oocytes ( Fig . 5 ) . The latter concept would offer a unique opportunity to establish patient - speciﬁc stem cells for regenerative therapy . Human ES and PG cell lines express alkaline phos - phatase and several cell surface markers inducing stages - peciﬁc antigens characteristic for embryonic and undifferentiated cells . In addition , human ES cells synthesize high level of telomerase that is required for adding telomeric repeats to chromosomal ends and maintaining the mitotic activity of cells . Somatic cells usually show low level of telomerase , contain shortened telomeres after prolonged culture in vitro and ﬁnally terminate their proliferative divisions . The high level of telomerase activity in ES cells contrary to cultured somatic cells supports their capacity for elevated replicative life - span . Although the human ES cell lines were not estab - lished clonally from individual cells but rather from morphologically homogenous cell populations , nev - ertheless they all expressed consistently the various cellular markers unique to ES cells , thereby providing strong evidence for functionally homogenous cell populations . When ES cells started to pile up under crowded culture conditions , they spontaneously dif - ferentiated and synthesized ﬁ - fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin . When human ES cells were transplanted to immune - suppressed SCID - mice , they developed teratomas that contained a variety of tissue derivations from all three germ layers . These teratomas included gut epithelium , cartilage , bone , smooth and striated muscle , neural and stratiﬁed squamous epithelium , and enclosed clusters of undifferentiated stem cells , so - called embryonal car - cinoma ( EC ) cells . In mice , teratomas are composed of a comparable variety of differentiated tissues and may also include EC cells . When these EC cells were transplanted individually into recipient mouse blastocysts , they populated clonally the developing embryos and participated normally to fetal growth giving rise to healthy chimeric mice ( 59 , 60 ) . When nuclei from these EC cells were transplanted into enucleated mouse egg cells and oocytes , some of them were capable of inducing and promoting embryogen - esis up to the blastocyst stage and showed a remark - able potential for embryonic development . These EC - clone embryos , however , were not transferred in uteri for further development but rather investigated biochemically and cytologically for the proof of suc - cessful nuclear transfer ( 61 ) .

In the nonhuman primate system , EC cells from rhesus monkey blastocysts were successfully established prior to human ES cells and showed sim - ilar morphological , biochemical , and developmental features including a quite comparable variety of dif - ferentiated cell types ( 62 ) .

Having safely developed the various strategies for therapeutic cloning in model systems ( 65 ) , there will be envisaged for the future a wide range of applications for human reproductive medicine that ultimately will help estab - lish novel approaches for the treatment of patients via stem cell therapy ( 66 , 67 ) . CLONING AND DIAGNOSIS Withtheintroductionandﬁrstapplicationofpreim - plantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) about a decade ago , reproductive medicine has reached new frontiers for medical diagnostic interventions ( 68 , 69 ) . For cou - ples with inherited defective genes or chromosomal anomalies and being enrolled in assisted reproduc - tion programs , PGD has been developed to detect such heritable aberrations . If there is genetic and medical indication for the performance of PGD , the severity of the disease in question , available therapy options , the prognosis of the hereditary disease as well as the presumed risk of the diseased gene being inherited by the offspring must be thoroughly investigated and clariﬁed by ge - netic counselling . The application of PGD lies in the area of assisted reproduction and should be made available to couples with an elevated risk of having children with severe diseases of heritable origin . An - other potential application of PGD might be envis - aged for older women with signiﬁcantly elevated and age - related risk for chromosomal aneuploidy during oocyte – meiosis . Undoubtedly , PGD has also its ap - plicability in ethnic groups with an accumulated high frequency of speciﬁc types of gene mutations . In the Eurasian population cystic ﬁbrosis ( CF ) and spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) with a 1 in 50 ratio for heterozygotic carriers are the most frequent autoso - mal recessive gene defects , in the Mediterranean re - gion thalassemia and hemophilia show an elevated frequency , in the Jewish population the heritable Tay - Sachs disease is preferentially elevated , and in the African - American population sickle cell anemia with an elevated frequency of about 8 % carrier status is a severe progressive disease and one of the most common genetic disorders . PGD offers the early examination of genetic de - fects on biopsied polar bodies of the egg cells and biopsied blastomeres of the developing preimplanta - tion embryos ( 70 ) . In addition , biopsied trophoblast cells from blastocysts can be submitted to PGD ( 71 ) . The great advantage of PGD resides in the early embryonic detection of parentally transmitted ge - netic and chromosomal anomalies before embryo transfer in utero . Only maternally contributed de - fects can be examined on the polar bodies of oocytes and fertilized eggs , whereas paternally and mater - nally derived defects can be both detected on blas - tomeres or trophoblast cells of preimplantation em - bryos ( Fig . 6 ) . Without PGD , these defects can certainly be detected on cells of biopsied chori - onic villus sampling during the 11th week of preg - nancy or on harvested cells from amniocentesis about 4 weeks later . The presence of genetic and chromo - somal anomalies represents a medical implication for legal abortion . With PGD , however , this physiological and psychological trauma of an induced abortion for couples with inborn errors at risk for heritable trans - mission and enrolled in assisted reproduction pro - grams can almost entirely be prevented , since only the healthy and not the genetically defective embryo will be transferred in utero following IVF or ICSI treatment . Sexing of embryos via PGD might be useful for those ICSI - enrolled couples with an infertile male partner carrying Y chromosome deletions that are responsible for his infertility . This defective Y chro - mosome will be transmitted to the ICSI sons becom - ing again infertile but not to the daughters . PGD should also be performed in those cases where Kline - felter ( XXY ) patients are enrolled in the assisted reproductionprogramtoavoidthetransmissionofsexchromosomalaneuploidytotheoffspring ( 72 ) . PGD performed on polar bodies for cytogenetic screening ofcommonaneuploidieshasledtothebirthofhealthychildren ( 73 ) . With highly sophisticated micromolec - ular cloning techniques such as polymerase chain re - action ( PCR ) or ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) methods , the biopsied cells can be analyzed within a few hours in order to determine the presence or absence of the hereditary gene defects or chro - mosomal alterations . Using molecular probes for X and Y chromosomes it is possible to reveal the sex of the embryos . In case of hereditary diseases where the defective genes are located on the maternal chro - mosomes , it is important to sex embryos since male ( XY ) embryos may carry the genetic defects on the maternally inherited X chromosome in a hemizygous fashion , leading to the phenotypic expression of the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics , Vol . 18 , No . 8 , 2001 P1 : VENDOR / GDW / GOQ / GEE P2 : LMD / QC : GCQ Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics PP196 - 341682 July 14 , 2001 17 : 8 Style ﬁle version Oct . 14 , 2000 CLONING IN REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE 461 Fig . 6 .

Female ( XX ) embryos , on the other hand , can be considered as balanced carriers since they may contain the defective maternal X chromo - some together with the inherited normal paternal X chromosome . Concerning structural chromosomal anomalies , balanced reciprocal translocations are quite fre - quently observed in one of every 500 live births . Phenotypically , normal carriers of such translocations may have an elevated risk of transmitting unbal - anced chromosomal segments to the offspring . New screening techniques have been developed for PGD to visualize the translocated region on metaphase chromosomes using breakpoint - speciﬁc probes or sub - telomeric probes for the segments involved in a given translocation ( 74 ) .

The same holds true for molecular probes that speciﬁcally rec - ognize genetic alterations . Currently , quite a number of heritable diseases and inborn metabolic dysfunc - tions caused by a single gene defect can be examined via PGD and this diagnostic repertoire will certainly be increased over the next years ( Fig . 7 ) . PGD is be - coming a powerful technique in assisted reproduction and provides a unique opportunity for carrier couples with the desire for a healthy child to avoid the painful decision of whether to abort a genetically or chromo - somally affected fetus . Future application of PGD can be projected to farm animal cloning to diagnose cells from cloned em - bryos for molecular defects of epigenetic changes that lead to developmental malformations . In this regard , early diagnosis of aberrant methylation of imprinted genes in cloned embryos from livestock can be taken as unequivocal criteria for their uselessness to trans - fer them in uteri . This diagnostic strategy should al - low to signiﬁcantly reduce the percentage of pre - and postnatal malformations and help to improve the de - velopmental quality of cloned livestock offspring .

Some of these new molecular technologies in ge - netic engineering have been successfully combined with farm animal cloning in order to create trans - genic animals carrying an integrated foreign gene in its genome that can heritably be transmitted in a Mendelian fashion to subsequent generations of progeny . Over the past years , several strategies have been developed to produce transgenic livestock ( 75 ) . Historically viewed , the ﬁrst successful attempts to transfect sheep and pigs with clonally derived for - eign genes were achieved by microinjection of the for - Fig . 8 . Cloned genes ( DNA solution ) can be microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized mammalian eggs . The foreign genes may by integrated during embryonic development , expressed during adult life of the transgenic mammals , and even transmitted heritably to their offspring . eign DNA sequences into pronuclei of fertilized eggs ( 76 , 77 ) . This technique enables to selectively inject the DNA into either the male or female pronucleus for chromosomal integration in either the paternal or maternal genome ( Fig . 8 ) . The drawbacks of this strat - egy of transgenetics , however , have turned out to give a low rate of stable genomic integration , a random process of chromosomal insertion , undesirable inser - tional mutagenesis and variable expression of the for - eign transgenes depending on their site if integration . Using the approach of DNA microinjection into the perivitelline space of metaphase II oocytes , following their fertilization , the births of transgenic cattle and rhesus monkeys have been reported recently ( 78 , 79 ) . Another route of transfection has been chosen to introduce foreign DNA into sperm which after fertil - ization will be integrated into the developing embryo and maintained in transgenic animals . However , the percentage of stable DNA integration into sperm is rather low and unpredictable , and random - insertion seemstobetherule ( 80 ) . Nevertheless , transgenicpigs Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics , Vol . 18 , No . 8 , 2001 P1 : VENDOR / GDW / GOQ / GEE P2 : LMD / QC : GCQ Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics PP196 - 341682 July 14 , 2001 17 : 8 Style ﬁle version Oct . 14 , 2000 464 ILLMENSEE carrying the human decay accelerating factor have re - cently been produced via sperm - mediated gene trans - fection ( 81 ) . A more promising but rather complex approach to cloning of transgenic farm animals is referring to the transfection of cultured somatic cells with for - eign genes and their clonal selection and expansion in vitro . The transfected cells can be analyzed for the presence and integration site of the particular transgene within their genome . Such cells can then be used for nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes to produce clonally derived transgenic animals . De - pending on the sex - chromosomal composition of the Fig . 9 . A variety of cloned human genes have been integrated into transgenic farm animals for pharmaceutical harvest and medical application of the synthesized human gene products . culturednucleardonorcells , theclonedtransgenicoff - spring will be entirely either females or males . This of course means , as an example , that cultured XX cells will be required for their genomic transfection if the biopharmaceutical protein is supposed to be har - vested from the milk of cloned cows ( 82 ) . This strat - egy has already been applied successfully to create cloned transgenic sheep , goat , and cattle in utilizing genetically transfected cells for cloning ( 83 ) . Several recombinant human proteins are efﬁciently produced in cloned livestock and can be taken as biologically functional components for a wide range of human pharmaceutical applicabilities ( Fig . 9 ) .

Quite a number of human gene prod - ucts are already being synthesized in cloned livestock for pharmaceutical and therapeutic purposes and are already tested in various phases of clinical trials . This biomedical repertoire will certainly increase over the next years as the demands on human pharmaceutical proteins , vaccines , drugs , and hormones will steadily begrowingworldwide . Geneticallyengineeredorgans and tissues from transgenic farm animals designed for xenotransplantations may be envisaged for future therapeutic applications in human medicine . As far as future applications of nonhuman pri - mate cloning are concerned , cloned monkeys with targeted gene defects will become useful and invalu - able models for studying human diseases and devel - oping new strategies for therapy . Future progress in cloning transgenic monkeys from genetically engi - neered ES cells in culture will signiﬁcantly help to in - crease our knowledge in biomedicine . With respect to human therapeutic cloning in reproductive medicine , a novel discipline of biomedical treatments dedicated to stem cell therapy for a variety of human diseases will emerge for the beneﬁt of patients’ health . Our so - ciety will have to set up the medical , legal , and ethical rules concerning human cloning ( 84 ) . It is fairly pre - dictable that the future will bring a wealth of exciting new applicabilities in the area of medical , therapeu - tic , and pharmaceutical biotechnology which in the ﬁrst instance should prove to be advantageous for pa - tients and which at the same time will result in further progress of reproductive medicine .
