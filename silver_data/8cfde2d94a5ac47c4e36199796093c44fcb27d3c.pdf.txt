Introduction Caveolae are smooth invaginations of the plasma membrane that were ﬁrst described in endothelial cells ( Palade , 1953 ; Yamada , 1955 ) . They represent a subdomain of glycolipid rafts , cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich membrane domains that are speciﬁcally associated with the cholesterol - binding caveolin proteins ( Anderson , 1998 ; Galbiati et al . , 2001 ; Kurzchalia and Parton , 1999 ) . The endocytosis of cholera toxin ( CTX ) - bound GM1 ganglioside and SV40 to the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) was originally attributed to caveolae on morphological grounds ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1989 ; Montesano et al . , 1982 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ; Tran et al . , 1987 ) . The use of cholesterol sensitivity , dynamin dependence and clathrin independence has expanded the repertory of caveolae / raft endocytic ligands to include sphingolipids , GPI - anchored proteins , the autocrine motility factor ( AMF ) , endothelin , growth hormone and IL2 receptors , as well as bacteria ( Benlimame et al . , 1998 ; Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Le et al . , 2000 ; Le et al . , 2002 ; Lobie et al . , 1999 ; Nichols et al . , 2001 ; Okamoto et al . , 2000 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ; Puri et al . , 2001 ; Shin et al . , 2000 ; Sukumaran et al . , 2002 ) . However , in hippocampal neurons , CTX bound to GM1 is found in detergent - insoluble membranes at the cell surface , but CTX endocytosis was blocked by inhibitors of clathrin - dependent endocytosis and not by ﬁlipin or m b CD ( Shogomori and Futerman , 2001a ) . M b CD rather blocks the cholesterol - dependent delivery of CTX from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus ( Shogomori and Futerman , 2001b ) , as previously reported for GPI - anchored folate receptor ( Mayor et al . , 1998 ) . These studies therefore describe a clathrin - dependent , endosome - mediated pathway for CTX to the Golgi . They further indicate that cholesterol sensitivity is not necessarily an indicator of caveolae - or raft - mediated internalization to the Golgi . Both clathrin - and caveolae / raft - dependent endocytosis are dynamin dependent ( Damke et al . , 1994 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ; Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; Le et al . , 2002 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ) . The fact that expression of mutant dynK44A inhibited only 40 - 50 % of CTX uptake in HeLa cells and that neither ﬁlipin nor caveolin - 1 overexpression inhibited CTX internalization in conﬂuent CaCo - 2 cells led to the suggestion that CTX also follows the dynamin - insensitive non - clathrin pathway ( Torgersen et al . , 2001 ) . However , in human skin ﬁbroblasts and in subconﬂuent CaCo - 2 cells , cholesterol - disrupting agents inhibit CTX internalization whereas agents that inhibit clathrin - dependent endocytosis , such as chlorpromazine and potassium depletion , do not affect CTX endocytosis ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ; Puri et al . , 2001 ) . Depletion of membrane cholesterol prevents CTX entry into the cells , transport to the Golgi and induction of chloride secretion ( Wolf et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , inhibition of dynamin function by either dynK44A expression or microinjection of anti - dynamin antibodies has been shown to qualitatively inhibit CTX endocytosis ( Henley et al . , 1998 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ) . These data from multiple studies in multiple cell types argue strongly for a role of caveolae in the internalization 1059 Internalization of autocrine motility factor ( AMF ) into the endoplasmic reticulum is sensitive to the cholesterol - extracting reagent methyl - b - cyclodextrin , inhibited by the dynamin - 1 K44A mutant and negatively regulated by caveolin - 1 . Thus , AMF internalization requires a caveolae - mediated endocytic pathway . Similarly , we show here that endocytosis of cholera toxin ( CTX ) in NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts is inhibited by adenoviral expression of the dynamin - 1 K44A mutant but only partially by expression of the clathrin hub . Treatment with methyl - b - cyclodextrin and overexpression of caveolin - 1 , but not the clathrin hub , selectively diminishes CTX endocytosis to the Golgi apparatus but not to endosomes . CTX is therefore targeted via a caveolin - 1 - regulated caveolae - mediated pathway to the Golgi . Disruption of Golgi - , caveosome - or endosome - mediated trafficking with brefeldin A , nocodazole or a 20°C temperature block , respectively , inhibit CTX endocytosis to the Golgi but do not affect AMF delivery to the endoplasmic reticulum . Following an incubation of only ﬁve minutes in the presence of the clathrin hub , AMF and CTX are not cointernalized , and AMF is delivered to the AMF - R - positive smooth ER . The internalization of both ligands is nevertheless sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein , conﬁrming that they are both internalized via caveolae / raft pathways . Two distinct caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways therefore exist , including a novel direct pathway to the ER from the plasma membrane .

However , a single study in a single cell type demonstrating the clathrin - independent , dynamin - dependent , cholesterol - sensitive , caveolae - mediated endocytosis of CTX has yet to be performed . CTX delivery to the Golgi apparatus in Cos - 7 cells is ﬁlipin sensitive but is not blocked by inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis with the eps15 mutant or inhibition of endosome function with a rab5 mutant . Therefore , a cholesterol - sensitive non - endosomal pathway is used for CTX delivery to the Golgi apparatus ( Nichols et al . , 2001 ) . CTX is delivered instead to a caveolin - 1 – GFP - positive transferrin receptor ( TfR ) - negative endocytic intermediate prior to delivery to the Golgi , implicating caveolae in this pathway ( Nichols , 2002 ) . Similarly , SV40 has previously been shown to be internalized to the ER via a caveolin - 1 – GFP - positive intermediate , named the caveosome ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . SV40 delivery via caveolae to the caveosome is associated with tyrosine kinase activation , the breakdown of actin ﬁlaments and the recruitment of dynamin II , whereas passage from the caveosome to the ER is blocked by treatment of the cells with nocodazole and is therefore microtubule dependent ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) . The recent demonstration that BFA ( brefeldin A ) and a 20°C temperature block , as well as mutants of arf1 and sar1 and antibodies to b - cop , block SV40 internalization and infectivity as well as the internalization of CTX suggests that both caveolar ligands follow a similar internalization route ( Norkin et al . , 2002 ; Richards et al . , 2002 ) . Although a role for the Golgi apparatus in SV40 delivery to the ER remains to be established ( Kartenbeck et al . , 1989 ; Norkin et al . , 2002 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ; Richards et al . , 2002 ) , SV40 and CTX appear to follow a similar , if not identical , pathway via the caveosome to the ER . We have previously proposed the caveolae - mediated endocytosis of AMF to the ER on the basis of its sensitivity to m b CD , its inhibition by the dynamin - 1 K44A mutant ( dynK44A ) and its negative regulation by overexpression of caveolin - 1 ( Benlimame et al . , 1998 ; Le et al . , 2000 ; Le et al . , 2002 ) . AMF - R is localized to a smooth ER subdomain , and we have no evidence from multiple EM studies that AMF - R is localized to the Golgi or that endocytosed AMF traverses the Golgi ( Accola et al . , 2002 ; Benlimame et al . , 1998 ; Benlimame et al . , 1995 ; Le et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 1997 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) . In order to compare the caveolae - mediated endocytosis of AMF and the retrograde pathway of CTX via the Golgi to the ER , we ﬁrst undertook to deﬁne the endocytic pathway of CTX in NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts . We show here that in NIH - 3T3 cells , 80 % of CTX uptake is blocked by adenoviral expression of the dynK44A mutant , but inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis with the dominant - negative hub fragment of the clathrin heavy chain has only a limited effect on CTX endocytosis . M b CD treatment and overexpression of caveolin - 1 selectively reduce CTX endocytosis to the Golgi apparatus but not to endosomes . In NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , the majority of CTX is therefore internalized via a caveolae - dependent mechanism to the Golgi with a minor part targeted via a clathrin - dependent mechanism to the endosome . Of particular interest is the fact that although BFA , nocodazole or a 20°C temperature block inhibit CTX delivery to the Golgi apparatus , they do not affect AMF delivery to the ER . Furthermore , although genistein inhibits the caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis of both CTX and AMF to the Golgi and smooth ER , respectively , after ﬁve minutes of endocytosis in the presence of the clathrin hub the two ligands do not cointernalize and AMF is targeted , apparently directly , to the AMF - R - labeled smooth ER . The caveolae - mediated endocytic pathway of AMF is therefore distinct from that of CTX and SV40 . Two caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways therefore exist that target either the Golgi or the ER from the plasma membrane . Materials and Methods Antibodies , reagents and cells A monoclonal rat antibody against AMF - R was used in the form of a concentrated hybridoma supernatant ( Nabi et al . , 1990 ) . Mouse anti - GM130 , polyclonal anti - caveolin antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories ( Mississauga , ON ) , mouse anti - TfR from Zymed Laboratories Inc . ( San Francisco , CA ) , mouse anti - T7 tag from Novagen ( Madison WI ) and mouse anti - c - Myc from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . Mouse anti - hemagglutinin ( HA ) was a gift from Luc Desgroseillers ( Department of Biochemistry , Université de Montréal ) . Alexa - 488 - , 568 - and 647 - conjugated secondary antibodies and anti - FITC antibody were purchased from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) and rhodamine - red - X anti - rat IgM and Texas Red anti - mouse secondary antibodies from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories ( West Grove , PA ) . M b CD , BFA , nocodazole , genistein , poly - L - lysine , FITC - conjugated B - subunit of CTX , tetramethylrhodamine - conjugated transferrin ( Rh - Tf ) and rabbit phosphohexose isomerase ( referred to as AMF ) were purchased from Sigma ( Oakville , ON ) and the Alexa - 594 - conjugated B - subunit of CTX was purchased from Molecular Probes . AMF was conjugated to ﬂuorescein with the Fluorescein - EX protein labeling kit ( Molecular Probes ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . An NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblast clone ( Benlimame et al . , 1998 ) was grown in complete medium consisting of DME supplemented with 10 % calf serum , non - essential amino acids , vitamins , glutamine and a penicillin - streptomycin antibiotic mixture ( Invitrogen Canada Inc . , Burlington , ON ) . Viral infection Recombinant adenoviruses expressing the tetracycline - regulated chimeric transcription activator ( tTA ) , HA - tagged wild - type dynamin - 1 , HA - tagged dynK44A mutant , T7 - tagged clathrin hub and myc - tagged caveolin - 1 under the control of the tetracycline - regulated promoter were as previously described ( Altschuler et al . , 1998 ; Altschuler et al . , 1999 ; Le et al . , 2002 ; Zhang et al . , 2000 ) . To enhance infection rates , viral stocks of the tTA and the indicated adenoviruses were diluted in 100 m l sterile PBS and pre - incubated with 18 m l of 1 m g / ml polylysine for 30 minutes at room temperature . 50 , 000 NIH - 3T3 cells were plated on 35 mm dishes for 10 hours and rinsed once with PBS before the addition of the adenovirus / polylysine mixture in 0 . 7 ml serum - free media . The cells were then incubated with the adenoviruses for 1 hour at 37°C . After removal of the adenovirus mixture , the cells were rinsed twice with serum - free media and then incubated for 36 hours in regular culture media . For the immunoﬂuorescence studies , viral titres were used such that 25 - 50 % of the cells were infected . For some experiments , the degree of infection with the clathrin hub adenovirus was assessed by labeling paraformaldehyde ﬁxed cells on parallel coverslips with monoclonal anti - T7 tag antibodies to ensure that at least 90 % of the cells expressed the clathrin hub . Immunoﬂuorescence NIH - 3T3 cells were incubated with 5 m g / ml FITC - CTX alone or coincubated with 5 m g / ml FITC - CTX and with 15 m g / ml Rh - Tf for Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 6 ) 1061 Distinct caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways 30 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C , washed ﬁve times with culture medium and ﬁxed with 3 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 . Alternatively , cells were incubated with 50 m g / ml of AMF - FITC alone or coincubated with 5 m g / ml Alexa 594 - CTX at 37 (cid:176) C for the indicated time , washed ﬁve times with culture medium and then ﬁxed with precooled ( – 80 (cid:176) C ) methanol / acetone ( Le et al . , 2000 ) . The cells were then labeled for GM130 , TfR , AMF - R , caveolin , T7 , Myc or HA tags with appropriate primary antibodies and Alexa - 568 - or - 647 - conjugated secondary antibodies , as indicated . Cell - surface FITC - CTX labeling was performed by incubating the cells at 4 (cid:176) C with 5 m g / ml FITC - CTX in bicarbonate - free DMEM - HEPES containing 0 . 5 % BSA ( cold DMEM ) for 30 minutes ( Benlimame et al . , 1998 ) . The cells were then rinsed three times with cold DMEM / HEPES / BSA , ﬁxed with 3 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 prior to labeling for the appropriate tags as described previously . Where indicated , cells were pretreated for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C with 5 mM m b CD ( Le et al . , 2002 ) , 10 m g / ml BFA , 10 m M nocodazole or 100 m g / ml genistein , and the drugs were maintained during incubation with the endocytic ligands . AMF - FITC endocytosis at 20 (cid:176) C was performed in bicarbonate - free DMEM - HEPES containing 0 . 5 % BSA . Fluorescently labeled cells were visualized with a Leica TCS - SP1 confocal microscope using 63 · or 100 · planapochromat objectives . To quantify endocytosis of FITC - CTX and Rh - Tf , the ﬂuorescence intensity within the perinuclear region of the cell was quantiﬁed from confocal images with Northern Eclipse imaging software ( Empix Imaging , Mississuaga , Ontario ) . Cell - surface FITC - CTX was quantiﬁed by measuring the ﬂuorescence intensity of the entire cell . Speciﬁc FITC - CTX internalization to the Golgi or endosomes and AMF - FITC internalization to smooth ER tubules were quantiﬁed using Northern Eclipse mask overlay software ( Empix Imaging ) as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . The intensity of FITC - CTX - labeled pixels within a mask region deﬁned by either the GM130 - labeled Golgi or TfR - labeled endosomes was determined relative to total cellular FITC - CTX labeling . Owing to the complex pattern of endocytosed AMF , including multivesicular bodies and ﬁbronectin ﬁbrils , in addition to the AMF - R - labeled smooth ER ( Le et al . , 2000 ) , the absolute intensity of AMF - FITC - labeled pixels within a mask region deﬁned by smooth ER AMF - R labeling was measured . Each measurement represents the quantiﬁcation of at least 30 cells from three distinct experiments . Results CTX is internalized via caveolae to the Golgi apparatus in NIH - 3T3 cells Following incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes , FITC - CTX is internalized by NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts into the perinuclear region . Double labeling with antibodies against either the TfR or the Golgi marker GM130 shows that FITC - CTX is delivered to both recycling endosomes and the Golgi apparatus ( Fig . 1A - F ) . Infection of cells with adenoviruses coding for the dynK44A mutant blocked the internalization of FITC - CTX and the clathrin - speciﬁc internalization of Rh - Tf ( Fig . 1G - J ) . FITC - CTX is therefore predominantly internalized in NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts via dynamin - dependent clathrin - or caveolae / raft - mediated pathways . Quantitative analysis shows that dynK44A mutant expression signiﬁcantly inhibits ( by > 80 % ) both FITC - CTX and Rh - Tf endocytosis into the perinuclear region , whereas the dynamin wildtype exhibits no effect ( Fig . 2A ) . Clathrin hub expression inhibits > 75 % of Rh - Tf endocytosis and < 25 % of Fig . 1 . DynK44A inhibits CTX internalization into endosomes and the Golgi apparatus . FITC - CTX internalized for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C ( A , D ) is localized to both endosomes labeled for TfR ( B ) and the Golgi apparatus labeled for GM130 ( E ) . The merged confocal images present FITC - CTX in green ( C , F ) and TfR ( C ) or GM130 ( F ) in red and colocalization in yellow . Alternatively , NIH - 3T3 cells were infected with both the tTA and dynK44A adenoviruses ( G - J ) , and after 36 hours , the cells were coincubated with FITC - CTX ( H ) and Rh - Tf ( I ) for 30 minutes at 37°C prior to ﬁxation . HA - tagged dynK44A - infected cells ( arrows ) were identiﬁed by postﬁxation labeling with anti - HA antibodies followed by Alexa647 anti - mouse secondary antibodies ( G ) . The merged confocal image presents FITC - CTX in green , Rh - Tf in red and colocalization in yellow ( J ) . Dramatic reduction in CTX and Rh - Tf internalization was observed in the dynK44A expressing cell .

To ensure that infection of NIH - 3T3 cells with the various adenoviruses did not affect FITC - CTX binding to cell - surface GM1 , cell - surface binding of FITC - CTX at 4°C was quantiﬁed in non - infected and infected cells . As shown in Fig . 2B , cells infected with the various adenoviruses did not present a reduction of cell - surface FITC - CTX labeling ( Fig . 2B ) , indicating that infection with the various adenoviruses did not affect accessibility of exogenous FITC - CTX to cell - surface GM1 .

Caveolae mediate CTX endocytosis . FITC - CTX ( empty bars ) and Rh - Tf ( ﬁlled bars ) were endocytosed for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C in cells infected with wild - type dynamin , dynK44A , clathrin hub and caveolin - 1 adenoviruses . Endocytosis into the perinuclear region was quantiﬁed in uninfected cells and in infected cells identiﬁed ( as indicated ) by postﬁxation labeling for the appropriate epitope marker . The degree of endocytosis is presented as the percentage of ﬂuorescence intensity relative to uninfected control cells ( A ) . Cell - surface FITC - CTX binding at 4 (cid:176) C was quantiﬁed in the adenovirus - infected cells and is presented as the percentage of ﬂuorescence intensity relative to uninfected control cells ( B ) . The data represent the average of three different experiments ( ±s . e . m . ) . The ability of dynK44A , but not the clathrin hub , to inhibit CTX endocytosis together with its reduction in caveolin - 1 infected cells demonstrates the existence of a caveolae - mediated CTX endocytic pathway . Fig . 3 . M b CD blocks CTX delivery to the Golgi but not to endosomes . NIH - 3T3 cells were either left untreated ( A - C ) or pretreated with 5 mM of m b CD ( D - L ) for 30 minutes then pulse labeled with FITC - CTX ( A , D , G ) and Rh - Tf ( B , E , H ) for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:176) C . Images presenting FITC - CTX internalization in the absence or presence of m b CD ( A , D ) were obtained using the same acquisition parameters . A smaller pinhole ( 0 . 6 Airy units ) and increased zoom ( G - L ) were used to assess the overlap between internalized FITC - CTX ( G ) , Rh - Tf - labeled endosomes ( H ) and the GM130 - labeled Golgi apparatus ( I ) . Merged confocal images present FITC - CTX in green and either Rh - Tf in red ( C , F , K ) or GM130 in red ( L ) and colocalization in yellow . A triple merge shows FITC - CTX in green , Rh - Tf in red and GM130 in blue ( J ) . In m b CD - treated cells , cell - surface FITC - CTX labeling is signiﬁcantly increased , and CTX is still internalized with transferrin to endosomes but not to the Golgi . Bars : A - F in F , 20 m m ; G - L in L , 8 m m . 1063 Distinct caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways ( P < 0 . 05 ) in cell - surface labeling was observed following infection with dynK44A , which is consistent with its ability to inhibit both the caveolae - and clathrin - mediated endocytosis of FITC - CTX . In NIH - 3T3 cells , the majority of FITC - CTX is therefore internalized via a caveolin - dependent pathway and a minor portion via a clathrin - dependent pathway . Caveolae - mediated endocytosis of CTX selectively targets the Golgi and not endosomes Treatment of NIH - 3T3 cells with 5 mM m b CD resulted in the signiﬁcantly increased cell - surface binding of FITC - CTX , owing to the release of sequestered GM1 from closed caveolae , but did not inhibit the endocytosis of FITC - CTX or Rh - Tf to endosomes ( Fig . 3A - F ) . In confocal sections obtained with a reduced pinhole ( 0 . 6 Airy units ) to exclude the increased cell - surface FITC - CTX labeling from the image , internalized FITC - CTX exhibited extensive colocalization with Rh - Tf - positive endosomes ( Fig . 3G , H , K ) . Within the crowded perinuclear region , the GM130 - labeled FITC - CTX - unlabeled Golgi could be clearly seen to intercalate between FITC - CTX - and Rh - Tf - positive endosomes ( Fig . 3J , L ) . Golgi delivery of CTX is therefore signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of m b CD . We subsequently infected cells with the caveolin - 1 adenovirus and assessed FITC - CTX delivery to either the GM130 - labeled Golgi or TfR - labeled endosomes . In caveolin - 1 - overexpressing cells , identiﬁed with a polyclonal anti - caveolin antibody , delivery of FITC - CTX to the Golgi was signiﬁcantly reduced ( Fig . 4A - D ) . Perinuclear FITC - CTX was localized predominantly to TfR - positive endosomes that were not labeled for caveolin , whereas peripheral FITC - CTX labeling colocalized extensively with caveolin , apparently at the cell surface ( Fig . 4E - J ) . Using mask overlay image analysis software ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) , we quantiﬁed the delivery of FITC - CTX to either GM130 - positive Golgi or TfR - positive endosomes in caveolin - 1 - infected and in - uninfected cells . Caveolin - 1 overexpression resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction ( ~ 50 % ) in the delivery of FITC - CTX to the Golgi but did not affect delivery of FITC - CTX to endosomes ( Fig . 4K , L ) . The fact that caveolin - 1 overexpression selectively reduces CTX delivery to the Golgi but not transferrin - positive endosomes provides direct evidence for a caveolae - mediated endocytic pathway to the Golgi apparatus . To conﬁrm that CTX internalization to the Golgi is caveolae - mediated , FITC - CTX was added to NIH - 3T3 cells infected Fig . 4 . Caveolin - 1 overexpression negatively regulates CTX internalization to the Golgi apparatus but not to endosomes . NIH - 3T3 cells were infected with the tTA and caveolin - 1 adenoviruses and after 36 hours pulse labeled with FITC - CTX ( A ) for 30 minutes at 37°C prior to ﬁxation . Cells were then triple labeled with anti - caveolin antibodies and Alexa 568 anti - rabbit antibodies ( B ) and anti - GM130 and Alexa 647 anti - mouse antibodies ( C ) . The infected cell is indicated by an arrow , and the merged confocal image ( FITC - CTX in green and GM130 in red ) shows reduced FITC - CTX internalization to the Golgi in the caveolin - 1 - infected cell ( D ) . Increased zoom of a caveolin - 1 - overexpressing cell ( E - J ) shows internalized FITC - CTX ( E ) and postﬁxation caveolin ( F ) and TfR ( G ) labeling . Merged confocal images present TfR in green and caveolin in red ( H ) and FITC - CTX in green and either caveolin ( I ) or TfR ( J ) in red . Quantiﬁcation by mask overlay of FITC - CTX internalization to the GM130 - positive Golgi ( K ) or to TfR - positive endosomes ( L ) shows that in cells overexpressing caveolin - 1 , FITC - CTX delivery to the Golgi apparatus is reduced . Bars : A - D in D , 20 m m ; E - J in J , 8 m m . 1064 with the clathrin hub adenovirus ( Fig . 5 ) . Five minutes after its addition , FITC - CTX colocalizes extensively with caveolin and after 30 minutes , FITC - CTX is associated predominantly with the Golgi apparatus . The fact that the clathrin hub only blocks a minor portion of CTX endocytosis ( Fig . 2 ) together with its inability to inhibit CTX delivery to the Golgi demonstrates clearly that in NIH - 3T3 cells , the majority of CTX is targeted via a clathrin - independent , caveolin - regulated pathway to the Golgi apparatus . Caveolae mediate distinct endocytic pathways to the Golgi and ER AMF - R is a marker for a mitochondria - associated smooth ER subdomain ( Benlimame et al . , 1998 ; Benlimame et al . , 1995 ; Wang et al . , 1997 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) , and in NIH - 3T3 cells , AMF - R is speciﬁcally localized to smooth and not rough ER tubules ( Benlimame et al . , 1998 ) . We have previously reported , using quantitative electron microscopy , that caveolin - 1 overexpression reduces the caveolae - mediated endocytosis of AMF to the ER in NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts as well as in ras and abl - transformed NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts that express little caveolin - 1 ( Le et al . , 2002 ) . Quantiﬁcation using a mask overlay assay revealed a 42 . 0±2 . 4 % reduction in AMF - FITC delivery to the AMF - R - labeled smooth ER in NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts that overexpress Myc - tagged caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 6 ) . These results are equivalent to those previously obtained by quantitative EM ( Le et al . , 2002 ) . The tubular distribution of the AMF - R - labeled smooth ER , a reﬂection of its interaction with mitochondria , can be disrupted by ilimaquinone or low cytosolic calcium ( Wang et al . , 1997 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) . In caveolin - 1 - infected cells , the AMF - R - labeled smooth ER exhibits a more diffuse distribution ( Fig . 6B , arrow ) , suggesting that regulation of caveolae - mediated endocytosis to this ER subdomain may inﬂuence the extent of its association with mitochondria . The fact that overexpression of caveolin - 1 reduces the internalization of AMF to the ER and of CTX to the Golgi demonstrates that they are both mediated by a similar caveolae - based endocytic mechanism . Entry of CTX is sensitive to BFA ( Donta et al . , 1993 ; Lencer et al . , 1993 ; Morinaga et al . , 2001 ; Nambiar et al . , 1993 ; Orlandi et al . , 1993 ) , and BFA has recently been shown to prevent delivery of CTX to the Golgi but not to endosomes ( Richards et al . , 2002 ) . In cells treated with nocodazole , SV40 entry is blocked at the level of the caveosome , and it is not delivered to the ER ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , a 20°C temperature block and BFA treatment inhibit early entry steps of SV40 , preventing its delivery to the ER ( Norkin et al . , 2002 ; Richards et al . , 2002 ) . As seen in Fig . 7 , BFA treatment of NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts inhibits FITC - CTX delivery to the fragmented Golgi but not to endosomes ( Fig . 7A - F ) . By contrast , BFA does not affect AMF - FITC delivery to the AMF - R - labeled smooth ER ( Fig . 7G - I ) . In the presence of nocodazole , FITC - CTX is not present in the Golgi apparatus although extensive colocalization is observed with caveolin and with TfR ( Fig . 8A - H ) . By contrast , AMF - FITC is delivered efficiently to the Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 6 ) Fig . 5 . CTX endocytosis in clathrin - hub - expressing cells . NIH - 3T3 cells infected for 36 hours with the tTA and clathrin hub adenoviruses were incubated at 37°C with FITC - CTX for 5 ( A - D ) or 30 minutes ( E - H ) . The distribution of FITC - CTX was visualized directly ( A , E ) and post - ﬁxation labeling with anti - caveolin ( B , F ) and anti - GM130 ( C , G ) antibodies revealed with the appropriate Alexa - 568 - and Alexa - 647 - conjugated secondary antibodies , respectively . Merged confocal images ( D , H ) present FITC - CTX in green , caveolin in red and GM130 in blue . After ﬁve minutes of endocytosis , CTX is primarily associated with caveolae and with time accumulates in the perinuclear region , where , after 30 minutes , it colocalizes extensively with the Golgi apparatus . Bar , 8 m m . 1065 Distinct caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways smooth ER in the presence of nocodazole as well as at 20°C ( Fig . 8I - N ) . The ability of BFA , nocodazole and a 20°C block to inhibit the targeting of CTX to the Golgi but not of AMF to the ER indicates that caveolae - internalized ligands can follow distinct intracellular targeting pathways . To determine whether the sorting of caveolae - internalized CTX and AMF occurred at the plasma membrane or intracellularly , clathrin - hub - infected NIH - 3T3 cells were incubated with AMF - FITC and Alexa - 594 – CTX for only 5 minutes ( Fig . 9A - F ) . Essentially no colocalization between the two caveolar ligands could be detected and , interestingly , internalized AMF colocalized with AMF - R - labeled smooth ER tubules . After 30 minutes , although CTX is colocalized predominantly to the Golgi apparatus , internalized AMF remains colocalized with the smooth ER and is excluded from the Golgi ( Fig . 9G - J ) . AMF and CTX would therefore appear to be segregated at the plasma membrane into different caveolae - mediated internalization pathways . To reconﬁrm that caveolae truly mediate delivery of both CTX to the Golgi and AMF to the smooth ER , we treated the cells with genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the caveolae - mediated endocytosis of SV40 and the transcytosis of albumin across the endothelial cell ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) . As seen in Fig . 10 , in the presence of genistein , CTX delivery to the Golgi but not to TfR positive endosomes was inhibited , conﬁrming that CTX delivery to the Golgi is caveolae mediated . Genistein also inhibited the delivery , detected after 5 minutes of incubation , of AMF - FITC to the smooth ER ( Fig . 10G - L ) . Discussion Caveolae mediate CTX endocytosis to the Golgi apparatus The ability of dynK44A expression to inhibit essentially all CTX endocytosis demonstrates that CTX is predominantly internalized via dynamin - dependent clathrin - and caveolae - mediated pathways in NIH - 3T3 cells ( Figs 1 , 2 ) . Adenoviral expression of the clathrin hub ( Altschuler et al . , 1999 ) only slightly reduces CTX uptake , which indicates that a minor proportion of CTX is entering NIH - 3T3 cells via the clathrin - dependent pathway . The differential inhibition of CTX endocytosis by dynK44A and the clathrin hub demonstrates clearly that in NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , the majority of CTX is internalized via a caveolae / raft pathway . Although we cannot exclude the possibility that some CTX is endocytosed via the dynamin - independent non - clathrin pathway ( Torgersen et al . , 2001 ) , it must be a relatively minor route for CTX entry in NIH - 3T3 cells . Our ability to inhibit CTX endocytosis with the dynK44A mutant may be because of the superior dynK44A expression levels obtained using adenoviral infection . Treatment of NIH - 3T3 cells with m b CD selectively inhibited CTX delivery to the Golgi but not to transferrin - positive endosomes ( Fig . 3 ) . Although these results could be explained by intracellular m b CD inhibition of CTX delivery to the Golgi from the endosome ( Mayor et al . , 1998 ; Shogomori and Futerman , 2001b ) , overexpression of caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 4 ) and treatment with genistein ( Fig . 10 ) , an inhibitor of caveolae - mediated endocytosis ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Tiruppathi et al . , 1997 ) , also selectively inhibit Golgi delivery but not endosomal delivery of CTX . Caveolin - 1 overexpression affects neither the cell - surface expression of GM1 nor the endocytosis of CTX to endosomes and therefore does not reduce Golgi delivery of CTX by reducing clathrin - mediated endocytosis to the endosome . These data provide direct evidence for the existence of a caveolae - mediated endocytic route to the Golgi and are consistent with and support previous studies describing the caveolae - mediated endocytosis of CTX to the Golgi ( Nichols , 2002 ; Nichols et al . , 2001 ) . CTX can therefore be endocytosed via both caveolae - and clathrin - mediated pathways . Differential rates of clathrin - or caveolae - mediated endocytosis and differential affinities of GM1 for endocytosis - competent raft domains may Fig . 6 . Caveolin - 1 overexpression reduces delivery of AMF - FITC to the smooth ER . NIH - 3T3 cells were infected with the tTA and caveolin - 1 adenoviruses and after 36 hours pulse labeled with AMF - FITC for 60 minutes at 37°C prior to ﬁxation . AMF - FITC was revealed with rabbit anti - FITC followed by Alexa 488 anti - rabbit antibodies ( A ) and the smooth ER labeled with anti - AMF - R mAb followed by Alexa 647 - anti - rat IgM antibodies ( B ) . The caveolin - 1 - overexpressing cell ( arrow ) was detected with anti - c - Myc antibodies followed by Texas - Red anti - mouse antibodies ( C ) . The merged confocal image presents AMF - FITC in green , the AMF - R - labeled smooth ER in red and colocalization in yellow ( D ) . Quantiﬁcation of AMF endocytosis to AMF - R - positive smooth ER tubules ( E ) shows that caveolin - 1 - expressing cells exhibit a signiﬁcant decrease in the caveolae - mediated endocytosis of AMF . Bar , 20 m m . 1066 inﬂuence the choice of endocytic pathway of CTX in different cell types . Caveolin - 1 - and caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis In cells expressing caveolin - 1 – GFP , a caveolin - positive endocytic intermediate , the caveosome , has been implicated in caveolae - mediated endocytosis , including that of both CTX and SV40 ( Mundy et al . , 2002 ; Nichols , 2002 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . In our study , expression of perinuclear caveolin - positive , TfR - negative vesicular structures was observed , particularly after caveolin - 1 overexpression , and some were positive for internalized CTX . Cell - associated CTX exhibited signiﬁcant colocalization with caveolin - 1 , primarily to peripheral cell - surface regions but also to some perinuclear structures ( Figs 4 , 5 ) . It was , however , difficult to ascertain whether these caveolin - positive structures are indeed intracellular endocytic vesicles and equivalent to caveosomes . The reduced endocytosis of CTX in caveolin - 1 - expressing cells corroborates our previous report of the negative regulation by caveolin - 1 of the caveolae - mediated delivery of AMF to the ER ( Le et al . , 2002 ) . As reported for the ER delivery of AMF in ras - and abl - transformed NIH - 3T3 cells expressing little caveolin ( Le et al . , 2002 ) , CTX is internalized via a cholesterol - sensitive raft pathway in CaCo - 2 cells that do not express caveolin ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) . Furthermore , reduction of caveolin - 1 levels using RNAi did not affect the internalization of CTX to the Golgi ( Nichols , 2002 ) . The fact that the caveolae - mediated endocytosis of AMF and CTX to the smooth ER and Golgi , respectively , occurs independently of caveolin - 1 expression argues that caveolae - and raft - mediated endocytosis are essentially equivalent processes deﬁned by cholesterol sensitivity , tyrosine kinase activation , dynamin - dependence and regulation by caveolin - 1 . The role of caveolin - 1 as a negative regulator of caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis is consistent with recent reports describing the immobilization of caveolin - 1 at the cell surface ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Thomsen et al . , 2002 ) . Caveolin - 1 expression may serve to stabilize the mobility of raft domains in and out of the plane of the membrane . The role of caveolin - 1 as a regulator and not as an essential component of the caveolae / raft endocytic machinery does not question its importance in deﬁning this endocytic pathway . Caveolin - 1 remains a critical determinant of caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis as a negative regulator of caveolae budding from the plasma membrane , a recruiter of cargo to endocytic caveolar domains or as a component of caveolae - speciﬁc endosomal intermediates . Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 6 ) Fig . 7 . BFA treatment inhibits the caveolae - mediated endocytosis of CTX to the Golgi apparatus but not of AMF to the smooth ER . NIH - 3T3 cells were pretreated with 10 m g / ml BFA for 30 minutes at 37°C and then incubated in the presence of BFA with 5 m g / ml FITC - CTX for 30 minutes at 37°C ( A - F ) or with 50 m g / ml AMF - FITC for 60 minutes at 37°C ( G - I ) . Cells incubated with FITC - CTX were labeled with either anti - GM130 ( B ) or anti - TfR ( E ) antibodies and merged confocal images present FITC - CTX in green and GM130 ( C ) or TfR ( F ) in red and colocalization in yellow . Internalized AMF - FITC was revealed with rabbit anti - FITC ( G ) and AMF - R tubules with anti - AMF - R mAb ( H ) followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies . The merged confocal image ( I ) presents the AMF in green and AMF - R in red and colocalization in yellow . In the presence of BFA , CTX is delivered to the endosomes but not to Golgi fragments , whereas AMF is still delivered to AMF - R - labeled smooth ER ( arrows ) . Bar , 8 m m . 1067 Distinct caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways Existence of two distinct caveolae / raft - mediated pathways BFA and a 20°C incubation , classic inhibitors of CTX delivery to the Golgi ( Donta et al . , 1993 ; Lencer et al . , 1993 ; Morinaga et al . , 2001 ; Nambiar et al . , 1993 ; Nichols et al . , 2001 ; Orlandi et al . , 1993 ; Richards et al . , 2002 ) , also inhibit SV40 endocytosis ( Norkin et al . , 2002 ; Richards et al . , 2002 ) . We further show here that nocodazole treatment , shown to prevent SV40 endocytosis past the caveosome ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) , also prevents CTX delivery to the Golgi . SV40 targeting to the ER may follow a similar retrograde pathway to that of CTX via the caveosome and potentially the Golgi apparatus before delivery to the ER . In contrast to CTX endocytosis to the Golgi and SV40 delivery to the ER , BFA , nocodazole and a 20°C incubation did not prevent the caveolae - mediated delivery of AMF to the ER ( Figs 7 , 8 ) . Furthermore , following incubations of both 5 and 30 minutes in the presence of the clathrin hub , the vast majority of AMF and CTX did not colocalize ( Fig . 9 ) . AMF is therefore internalized via a caveolae - mediated endocytic route distinct from that of either CTX or SV40 . The fact that AMF could be detected in AMF - R - positive smooth ER tubules after only 5 Fig . 8 . Nocodazole treatment and a 20°C temperature block inhibit the caveolae - mediated endocytosis of CTX to the Golgi but not of AMF to the smooth ER . NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts pretreated with 10 m M nocodazole at 37°C ( A - K ) were pulse labeled with either 5 m g / ml FITC - CTX for 30 minutes at 37°C ( A - H ) or with 50 m g / ml AMF - FITC for 60 minutes at 37°C ( I - K ) in the presence of nocodazole . Alternatively , cells were incubated with 50 m g / ml AMF - FITC for 60 minutes at 20°C ( L - N ) . Overlap of endocytosed FITC - CTX ( A , D ) with anti - GM130 ( B ) , anti - caveolin ( E ) or anti - TfR ( F ) labeling and of AMF - FITC ( I , L ) with anti - AMF - R ( J , M ) labeling was determined . The merged confocal images ( C , G , H , K , N ) present the indicated labels in red and green and colocalization in yellow . In the presence of nocodazole FITC - CTX is not delivered to the fragmented Golgi ( A - C ) but remains associated with caveolin and TfR - positive endosomes ( D - H ) . Neither nocodazole treatment ( I - K ) nor a 20°C temperature block ( L - N ) prevent AMF delivery to the smooth ER ( arrows ) . Bar , 8 m m . 1068 minutes argues strongly that this pathway is a direct pathway to the ER . We have no evidence for the involvement of a caveolin - positive vesicular intermediate in the endocytosis of AMF . Since nocodazole does not inhibit AMF delivery to the ER , any such endosomal intermediate would necessarily be distinct from the caveosome that mediates SV40 endocytosis ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . Distinct endosomal populations are apparently targeted by clathrin , non - clathrin and caveolar vesicles ( Nichols , 2002 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . The demonstration here that caveolae - derived vesicles can target different organelles shows that intracellular targeting in endocytosis is more complex than ‘one vesicle one endosome’ . The functional signiﬁcance of an alternative , apparently direct , endocytic pathway to the ER remains to be determined . Such a pathway could be involved in the recovery of Golgi or ER proteins mistargeted to the plasma membrane or in the targeting of proteins for degradation in the ER . Caveolin redistributes to the ER in the presence of cholesterol oxidase ( Conrad et al . , 1995 ) , and cholesteryl ester is transported to the ER from the plasma membrane ( Uittenbogaard et al . , 2002 ) ; however , these pathways appear to be non - vesicular and distinct from the endocytic pathway of AMF - R . AMF - R is localized to a mitochondria - associated subdomain of the smooth ER , whose association with mitochondria is calcium Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 6 ) Fig . 9 . AMF and CTX do not cointernalize . NIH - 3T3 cells were coincubated with 50 m g / ml of AMF - FITC and 5 m g / ml of Alexa 594 - CTX at 37°C for 5 minutes ( A - F ) or 30 minutes ( G - J ) prior to ﬁxation with precooled methanol / acetone . The distributions of AMF - FITC , revealed with rabbit anti - FITC followed by Alexa 488 anti - rabbit antibodies ( A and G ) , and of Alexa - 594 – CTX ( B , H ) were compared after ﬁve minutes with the smooth ER labeled with anti - AMF - R mAb and Alexa 647 anti - rat IgM antibodies ( C ) or at 30 minutes with the Golgi apparatus labeled with anti - GM130 mAb and Alexa 647 anti - mouse antibodies ( I ) . Merged confocal images present AMF - FITC in green and either AMF - R ( D ) or Alexa 594 - CTX ( E ) in red . Triple merges show AMF - FITC in green , Alexa 594 - CTX in red and either AMF - R ( F ) or GM130 ( J ) in blue . Bar , 8 m m . 1069 Distinct caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways dependent ( Wang et al . , 2000 ) . A direct endocytic pathway to this smooth ER subdomain may function to maintain its integrity and functionality . The IP3R is also localized to caveolae and smooth ER ( Fujimoto et al . , 1992 ; Ross et al . , 1989 ; Sharp et al . , 1992 ) , implicating these two organelles and any interaction between them in the regulation of calcium homeostasis . The existence of two caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways implies the existence of distinct endocytosis - competent caveolae populations at the cell surface ( Maxﬁeld , 2002 ) . AMF and CTX may be either segregated in different caveolae / raft domains at the plasma membrane or their segregation may occur upon internalization of these domains . In endothelial cells of the rete mirabel , albumin and insulin were localized to distinct caveolae populations , which demonstrates the segregation of caveolar endocytic cargo ( Bendayan and Rasio , 1996 ) . The existence of distinct rafts and segregation of raft components has been demonstrated by the distribution of GM1 to the uropod and GM3 to the lamellipodia of migrating T lymphocytes ( Gomez - Mouton et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , immunoisolation techniques have allowed the separation of caveolin - 1 - positive rafts from caveolin - 1 - negative rafts , which suggests the existence of at least two , and potentially multiple , distinct classes of rafts at the plasma membrane ( Badizadegan et al . , 2000 ; Matveev and Smart , 2002 ; Riddell et al . , 2001 ; Stan et al . , 1997 ) . The composition of raft domains is a determinant of their endocytic potential . As shown here for CTX and previously for AMF ( Le et al . , 2002 ) , caveolin - 1 is a regulator of caveolae / raft endocytosis that may act to segregate endocytic and non - endocytic raft domains . However , the caveolin - 1 - independent internalization of CTX ( Nichols , 2002 ; Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) , AMF ( Le et al . , 2002 ) and the IL2 receptor in lymphocytes ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) argues that regulation of caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis is more complex than just caveolin . The ability of SV40 to induce a signaling cascade that regulates its internalization demonstrates a role for ligand binding and receptor - mediated signal transduction in the Fig . 10 . Targeting of AMF to the ER and CTX to the Golgi apparatus is tyrosine kinase dependent . NIH - 3T3 cells were pretreated with genistein ( 100 m g / ml ) for 30 minutes during ligand incubation ( A - I ) or left untreated ( J - L ) . Cells were pulse labeled with FITC - CTX for 30 minutes at 37°C ( A , D ) and labeled with monoclonal anti - GM130 ( B ) or anti - TfR antibodies ( F ) following by Alexa 568 anti - mouse secondary antibody . The merged confocal images present FITC - CTX in green and either GM130 ( C ) or TfR ( F ) in red and colocalization in yellow ( C , F ) . Genistein selectively inhibits CTX delivery to the Golgi but not to TfR - positive endosomes . Alternatively , NIH - 3T3 cells were pulse labeled with AMF - FITC for 5 minutes at 37°C . AMF - FITC was revealed with rabbit anti - FITC followed by Alexa 488 anti - rabbit antibodies ( G , J ) and the smooth ER labeled with anti - AMF - R followed by rhodamine - red - X anti - rat IgM antibodies ( H , K ) . The merged confocal images present AMF - FITC in green and AMF - R in red and colocalization in yellow ( I , L ) . The image of AMF endocytosis in the presence of genistein ( G ) was acquired at the same intensity level as the control in the absence of genistein ( J ) , clearly demonstrating that genistein inhibits AMF delivery to the smooth ER .

Although common denominators of caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis include cholesterol sensitivity , dynamin - mediated internalization , tyrosine kinase activation and regulation by caveolin - 1 , other factors may sort cargo to diverse plasma membrane caveolae / raft domains , segregate endocytic cargo within caveolae / raft domains and regulate the invagination and intracellular targeting of caveolae / raft - derived caveolar vesicles .
