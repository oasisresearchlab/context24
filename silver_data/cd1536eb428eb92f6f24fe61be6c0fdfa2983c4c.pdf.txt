Received 21 April 2016 ; Revised 4 January 2017 ; Accepted 24 January 2017 Abstract Phenotype - driven mutagenesis is an unbiased method to identify novel genes involved in sper - matogenesis and other reproductive processes . Male repro29 / repro29 mice generated by the Re - productive Genomics Program at the Jackson Laboratory were infertile with deformed sperm and poor motility . Using selected exonic capture and massively parallel sequencing technologies , we identiﬁed a nonsense mutation in the exon 6 of coiled - coil domain - containing 62 gene ( Ccdc62 ) , which results in a formation of a premature stop codon and a truncated protein . Among the tissues examined , CCDC62 was found to be expressed at the highest level in mouse testis by re - verse transcriptase - PCR ( RT - PCR ) and Western blot analysis . With immunoﬂuorescent staining , we demonstrated that CCDC62 was expressed in the cytoplasm and the developing acrosome in the spematids of mouse testis , and was speciﬁcally localized at the acrosome in mature sperm . The complementation analysis by mating repro29 / + mice with Ccdc62 - / - mice ( generated by CRISPR - Cas9 strategy ) further provided genetic proof that the infertility of repro29 / repro29 mice was caused by Ccdc62 mutation . Finally , it was found that intracellular colocalization and interaction of CCDC62 and Golgi - associated PDZ and coiled - coil motif - containing protein may be important for acrosome formation . Taken together , this study identiﬁed a nonsense mutation in Ccdc62 , which directly results in male infertility in repro29 / repro29 mice . C (cid:3) The Authors 2017 .

Key words : repro29 , spermiogenesis , CCDC62 , acrosome , male infertility . Introduction Male infertility is a global medical problem affecting at least 1 in 20 men of reproductive age according to reports from the World Health Organization [ 1 ] . Previous studies have found that many different factors are involved in male infertility , such as genetic , bi - ological , and sexual problems ; however , the molecular mechanisms are still unknown [ 2 – 5 ] . For many men , assisted reproductive tech - niques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection , while not offering a cure to infertility , do offer the hope of fathering children [ 5 ] . Spermiogenesis is a highly regulated process by which germ cells undergo a series of complex and dramatic morphological changes that lead to the formation of the highly specialized spermatozoon [ 6 , 7 ] . Spermatids exhibit complex and speciﬁc patterns of gene expres - sion during spermatogenesis [ 8 ] . These changes are characterized by the expression of genes coding for testis - speciﬁc proteins , or coding for proteins synthesized in the somatic cells . Although more than 50 % of mouse genome is activated during spermatogenesis , only 4 % of the genome is exclusively expressed in the postmeiotic male germ cells [ 9 ] . It has been estimated that more than 2000 genes participate in the process of spermatogenesis [ 10 ] . Many of these genes encode proteins involved in acrosome formation , sperm – egg interactions and fertilization , but the functions of a large number of these genes remains unclear . Identiﬁcation of these genes and stud - ies on the features of their spatial and chronological expression are essential for understanding the mechanisms of male infertility . Most of the current understanding of the genetics of male infer - tility has come from studies of gene - targeted mutations in mice [ 2 – 4 , 11 ] . Despite progress in deﬁning mouse fertility genes using targeted mutagenesis technology , many genes required for spermiogenesis re - main to be modeled and identiﬁed [ 12 – 14 ] . The ReproGenomicsPro - gram was founded as a “phenotype - based” rather than “expression - based” strategy for the discovery of novel genes involved in fertility using N - ethyl - N - nitrosourea ( ENU ) - induced mutagenesis and fertil - ity screening at the Jackson Laboratory ( JAX ) [ 15 , 16 ] . From this program , the repro29 / repro29 male mice were reported to be infer - tile due to disruption of spermiogenesis [ 17 ] . In the present study , we identiﬁed a nonsense mutation in coiled - coil domain - containing 62 gene ( Ccdc62 ) , a previously uncharac - terized vertebrate - speciﬁc gene in repro29 / repro29 mice by sequenc - ing of candidate genes . Phenotypic characterization revealed that the sperm shape was abnormal and motility was low in repro29 / repro29 mice . Importantly , intracellular distribution of CCDC62 during the four stages of acrosome formation indicated its potential role in spermiogenesis , which was possible mediated by colocalization and interaction with Golgi - associated PDZ and coiled - coil motif - containing protein ( GOPC ) . Materials and methods Animals Repro29 mice were obtained from the JAX ( Bar Harbor , ME , USA ) . All animals were treated according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the Institute of Labora - tory Animal Resources for the National Research Council . This study was also approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking Univer - sityShenzhenHospital . Themicewerehousedinanspeciﬁcpathogen free ( SPF ) animal facility with a 12 - h light – dark cycle and were free to access standard diet and water . Genetic mapping and sequencing Adult B6 male mice were induced with ENU , and the fertility of repro29 mice was analyzed with a standard three - generation breed - ing approach . To build chromosomal linkage of the repro29 gene mutation , genome scans were conducted on affected ( infertile ) and unaffected ( fertile ) G3 mice using two to three polymorphic satel - lite markers per autosomal chromosome . A region of approximately 29 Mb on Chromosome 5 ( Chr5 ) , located between D5Mit240 and D5Mit98 , was identiﬁed as the candidate position for the repro29 gene mutation [ 17 ] . For sequencing of the candidate genes , mouse genomic DNA was isolated from the tail tips of wild type ( WT , + / + ) , heterozygous ( repro29 / + ) , and homozygous ( repro29 / repro29 ) mutant mice . To identify the mutated gene in this candidate region , selected exonic se - quence capture and massively parallel sequencing technologies were designed at Roche NimbleGen ( USA ) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Platform . The data were analyzed by BGI ( Shenzhen , China ) and veriﬁed by Sanger DNA sequencing . Bioinformatic analysis Bioinformatics related to the genome , chromosome , mRNA , and protein products of Ccdc62 were obtained using the National Center for Biotechnology Information , the Mouse Genome Informatics , and UCSC Genome bioinformatics ( UCSC ) . Multiple sequence alignment of identiﬁed orthologs was assessed using MegAlign ( Demonstra - tion System DNASTAR , Inc . , Madison , USA ) . The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics ( SIB ) Bioinformatics Resource Portal ( ExPASy ) was applied to analyze the domains and motifs of the CCDC62 protein . Quantitative reverse transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , CA , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s protocols . The ﬁrst - strand cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT Master kit ( Takara , Japan ) . The primers used for ampliﬁcations of Ccdc62 : 5 (cid:4) - ACATTTCAGACTGCTCGGGTA - 3 (cid:4) ( forward ) ; 5 (cid:4) - GACTTCAATCCTAAGTGCCTTC - 3 (cid:4) ( reverse ) . The quantitative reverse transcriptase - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) was detected using the SYBR Premix EX Taq II PCR Kit ( Takara , Dalian , Japan ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions on the Roche lightcycler 480 Real - Time PCR System . The reaction was performed as follows : 95˚C for 2 min , 95˚C for 10 s , 60˚C for 30 s , for 35 cycles , and ﬁnally , held at 12˚C . The Gapdh gene was used as an internal control . The data were cal - culated according to the Applied Biosystems comparative Ct method . CCDC62 is associated with spermiogenesis , 2017 , Vol . 96 , No . 3 589 Histology and immunoﬂuorescence staining Testes were ﬁxed with Bouin’s solution ( Danvers , MA , USA ) , and followed by dehydration , parafﬁn embedding , and sectioning to 3 – 5 - μ m thickness using an Ultrathin Semiautomatic Microtome ( Le - ica , Bensheim , Germany ) . Next , sections were deparafﬁnized with xylene solution and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) ac - cording to standard procedures . The result was visualized using a Leica microscope and analyzed with Leica FireCam software ( Leica , Bensheim , Germany ) . For immunoﬂuorescence staining ( IF ) , testes were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 – 20 h . Parafﬁn sections were prepared as described above . After blocking in 10 % goat serum , samples were incubated with anti - CCDC62 antibody ( 1 : 50 , Santa Cruz Biotech - nology , # sc - 240210 ) and PNA ( peanut agglutinin , a speciﬁc marker of outer acrosome membrane , 1 : 300 ) overnight at 4˚C . The appro - priate Alexa Fluor secondary antibody was added , and slides were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 ( 1 μ g / ml , Invitrogen , CA , USA ) and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent ( Invitrogen , CA , USA ) [ 18 ] . The results were visualized using Laser Scanning Confo - cal Microscopy ( Zeiss , Germany ) and analyzed using Image - Pro Plus 5 . 1 software . Scanning electron microscopy Adult mouse sperm were ﬁxed using 2 – 3 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 2 M cacodylate solution overnight at 37˚C and then washed with phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) and immersed in 1 . 5 % OsO4 in 0 . 2M cacodylate solution for 2h at 37˚C . The samples were processed with standard procedure as previously reported [ 19 ] , and then visualized using Hitachi S - 4800 scanning electron microscope ( Ibaraki , Japan ) . Western blot analysis Proteins were extracted using RIPA Lysis Buffer ( Beyotime Biotech - nology , Shanghai , China ) and quantiﬁed using the Pierce BCA Pro - tein Assay Kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , Waltham , USA ) . After denaturing at 105˚C for 15 min , the proteins were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE ( sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ) and transferred onto PVDF ( polyvinylidene ﬂuoride ) membranes ( Billerica , MA , USA ) . The membranes were blocked with 5 % ( w / v ) low - fat milk in TBST ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) and incubated with anti - CCDC62 antibody ( 1 : 500 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , # sc - 240210 ) overnight at 4˚C . The mem - branes were incubated with corresponding HRP - labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature . Positive bands were detected using the ECL kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , Waltham , USA ) . Generation of Ccdc62 knockout mice by CRISPR - Cas9 The Ccdc62 knockout mice ( B6 background ) were generated at the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University ( Nanjing , China ) using CRISPR - Cas9 technology as previously described [ 20 ] . The sequences used to synthesize sgRNA for generating exon 2 drop out allele are as follows : CCDC62 - S1a ( AGGAACTTCAGCTGCT CATC ) ( PAM : GGG ) , CCDC62 - S1b ( CTTCCGCTGCTTCTCAA TAG ) ( PAM : TGG ) , CCDC62 - S2a ( GAGCGCTGCAGCAAGCT CGA ) ( PAM : AGG ) , CCDC62 - S2b ( CCAGGGTCAGCACTTTCT GC ) ( PAM : CGG ) . Cas9 - mRNA ( 20 – 200 ng / μ l ) and sgRNA ( 20 – 50 ng / μ l ) were microinjected into the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs from B6 mice . Thirty - seven pups were born from 50 injected em - bryos , and four of them ( No . 7 , No . 10 , No . 12 , and No . 26 mice ) contained disrupted Ccdc62 as veriﬁed by PCR / Sanger sequencing . In order to integrate Ccdc62 mutation into germ line , No . 7 male Table 1 . The genotype and fertility of repro29 mice .

The sequences of the primers for ampliﬁcation are as follows : 5 (cid:4) - GCAGACCGTGCGACAGGCTT - 3 (cid:4) ( forward ) , 5 (cid:4) - TGGACAAGGATGGAGG CAGA - 3 (cid:4) ( reverse ) . Coimmunoprecipitation assay Coimmunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) wasperformedusingmagneticDyn - abeads protein G ( # 10003D , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc . , MA , USA ) loaded with anti - CCDC62 antibody ( 1 : 500 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , # sc - 240211 ) , anti - PICK1 antibody ( 1 : 500 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , # sc - 9539 ) , or anti - GOPC ( 1 : 1000 , Abcam , # ab37036 ) antibody according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After crosslinking , the unbounded antibodies were washed with 0 . 1 M Glycine HCl buffer ( pH 3 . 0 ) . Testes lysates isolated from WT or Ccdc62 knockout mice were lysed on ice with lysis buffer [ 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 2 mM EGTA or CaCl2 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % ( v / v ) NP - 40 , protease inhibitor cocktail ( P8340 , Sigma ) ] for 20 – 30 min . After centrifuged at 13 , 000 g at 4 ◦ C for 15 min , the supernatants were pretreated with Protein A / G PLUS - Agarose ( # sc - 2003 , Santa Cruze ) at room temperature for 30 min , in order to re - duce nonspeciﬁc immunoglobulin binding . Then , the above prepared Dynabeads - Ab complexes were incubated with pretreated samples at 4 ◦ C overnight . Finally , the eluted immunoprecipitated complexes were washed twice with 0 . 1 M Glycine HCl buffer ( pH 3 . 0 ) and prepared with SDS - PAGE loading buffer for the following Western blot analysis as described above . Statistical analysis All assays were repeated at least three times . Statistical analysis was evaluated using SPSS19 . 0 . The data are presented as mean ± SD . The statistical signiﬁcance of the differences in mean values was assessed using Student t - test . P - values < 0 . 05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant . Results The N - ethyl - N - nitrosourea - induced repro29 mutation causes male infertility in mice Initial phenotypic analysis revealed that repro29 / repro29 mice were apparently normal and presented no obvious phenotypic differences ofgrosswhencomparedwithWTand repro29 / + mice . However , the male repro29 / repro29 mice failed to produce offspring after natural mating with normal WT or repro29 / + mice for more than 2 months , while plugs were normally observed in mated WT and heterozygous females ( Table 1 ) . In addition , male repro29 / + mice and female re - pro29 / repro29 mice were fully fertile with an average litter size of 6 . 7 ± 2 . 1 and 7 . 4 ± 1 . 4 ( mean ± SD ) , respectively ( Table 1 ) . On the other hand , there were no signiﬁcant differences in testis appear - ance ( Figure 1A ) , weight ( Figure 1B ) , and morphology ( Figure 1C ) 590 Y .

( D ) Sequence alignment of CCDC62 among different species . The mutant amino acids are boxed , and the asterisk ( ∗ ) indicates conserved residue . between WT and repro29 / repro29 mice . Moreover , scanning elec - tron microscopy analysis showed that the repro29 / repro29 mouse sperm has outer dense ﬁbers with the middle piece ( MP ) wrapped around the sperm head . The head and middle piece is enclosed within a bag of cytoplasm , and the principal piece of the ﬂagellum is visible ( Figure 1D ) . To investigate how the repro29 mutation leads to male infer - tility , we also evaluated the sperm count , motility , and morphol - ogy in the three types of mice . The total number of sperm from a single cauda epididymis of adult repro29 / repro29 mice was about 12 × 10 6 , which was similar to that of WT and heterozygous mice ( Figure 1E ) . However , the sperm motility was severely affected in the repro29 / repro29 mice . The number of motile sperm from re - pro29 / repro29 mice was less than 5 % of those from WT mice , and the percentage of deformed sperm was almost 100 % in re - pro29 / repro29 mice ( Figure 1F and G ) . The above results indicate a strong disruption of spermiogenesis in repro29 / repro29 mice . Mapping the repro29 mutation and sequencing of the candidate gene To identify the location of the causative mutation for the observed phenotypes , mouse genome scans were performed on DNA from repro29 mice using two to three polymorphic microsatellite markers on the B6 mouse autosomal chromosomes . A 29 - Mb genomic region on Chr5 between D5Mit240 and D5Mit98 , which contains 522 known and hypothetical genes , was identiﬁed as the candidate site for the ENU - induced mutation in all infertile repro29 / repro29 males [ 21 ] .

( B ) CCDC62 protein expression was detected by Western blot in + / + , repro29 / + , and re - pro29 / repro29 mouse testes ( 8 weeks ) . A truncated fragment of 32 kDa , in - stead of 79 kDa band of CCDC62 , was detected in repro29 / repro29 mice . GAPDH was used as an internal control . With selected exonic sequence capture and massively parallel sequencing , we identiﬁed a point mutation in exon 6 of Ccdc62 gene ( Figure 2A and B ) . The result was further conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing . MyHits motif scan analysis ( http : / / myhits . isb - sib . ch / cgi - bin / motif scan ) demonstrated that CCDC62 contained two coiled - coil domains and two motifs ( Leu - Xaa - Xaa - Leu - Leu , LXXLL ) ( Figure 2C ) . This mutation converts a cytosine ( C ) into a thymine ( T ) , thereby replacing an arginine ( R ) with a stop codon 592 Y . Li et al . , 2017 , Vol . 96 , No . 3 Figure4 . TemporalexpressionproﬁleofCCDC62duringmousetestisdevelopment . Thedistributionof Ccdc62 mRNA ( A ) andprotein ( B ) indifferenttissuesfrom adult WT mice ( 8 weeks ) was detected by qRT - qPCR and Western blot , respectively . The relative expression of Ccdc62 mRNA in different tissues was compared to that in the testis , after normalizing to Gapdh . The mRNA ( C ) and protein ( D ) expression of CCDC62 in mouse testes at the indicated ages was determined using qRT - PCR and Western blot . ( E ) The localization of CCDC62 in mouse and human sperm was examined by immunoﬂuorescence analysis . CCDC62 protein was labeled with CCDC62 antibody ( green ) . Cell nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33258 ( blue ) . n = 5 . Scale bars : 50 μ m . in the highly conserved second coiled - coil domain of CCDC62 ( Fig - ure 2D ) . After searching EST databases , GEO proﬁles , and related articles , we speculated that the nonsense mutation in the Ccdc62 gene might be responsible for the male infertility of repro29 / repro29 mice . The nonsense mutation affected the expression of CCDC62 in mouse testis We performed qRT - PCR and Western blot to determine whether the nonsense mutation has any effect on the mRNA and protein expression levels of CCDC62 in the testes of WT , repro29 / + and re - pro29 / repro29 mice . As shown in Figure 3A , Ccdc62 mRNA expres - sion was signiﬁcantly downregulated in the testes of repro29 / repro29 mice , when compared to WT group . Moreover , a smaller band of approximately 32 kDa , instead of a 79 - kDa protein , was detected in the testes of repro29 / repro29 mice ( Figure 3B ) . The result suggests that a truncated form of CCDC62 is expressed in repro29 / repro29 mice . Tissue and temporal expression proﬁles of Ccdc62 during mouse testis development High - throughput gene expression proﬁling reported at BioGPS . org ( http : / / biogps . org ) indicates that the Ccdc62 transcript is only ex - pressed in the testis . To verify the testis - speciﬁc expression pattern of Ccdc62 , qRT - PCR and Western blot were performed to detect its expression in various tissues of adult mice ( 8 weeks ) . Unlike the gene expression databases , we found that Ccdc62 mRNA were widely ex - pressed in several tissues , including testis , epididymis , lung , spleen , CCDC62 is associated with spermiogenesis , 2017 , Vol . 96 , No . 3 593 Figure 5 . CCDC62 was involved in acrosome formation . The intracellular distribution patterns of CCDC62 during spermiogenesis were determined by IF . In WT mouse testes , CCDC62 ( green ) was mainly distributedin theGolgi duringGolgi phase , and indevelopingacrosomeduringcapphase . In repro29 / repro29 mouse testes , the truncated CCDC62 was not localized to the developing acrosome , and presented in a new pattern of larger cytoplasmic aggregates . The acrosome structure was not intact and the nucleus was somewhat condensed in the spematids of maturation phase from repro29 / repro29 mouse testis . The intact acrosomes were labeled by PNA ( red ) , and the cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 ( blue ) . Scale bars : 5 μ m . etc . , with the highest levels in mouse testis ( Figure 4A ) . Among the tissues examined , Western blot analysis showed that CCDC62 pro - tein was only detectable in testis ( Figure 4B ) . Next , Ccdc62 expression levels at different time points during postnatal testis development were detected using qRT - PCR and Western blot . As shown in Figure 4C , the expression of Ccdc62 mRNA was detectable from ﬁrst week , and increased dramatically and linearly from second week until eighth week . The expression lev - els between eighth week and sixth month were similar . Consistent with mRNA expression pattern , the protein level of CCDC62 was also enhanced linearly during testicular development ( Figure 4D ) . CCDC62 is associated with acrosome formation in mice To determine the subcellular distribution of CCDC62 in sperm , we conducted IF and found that the CCDC62 protein was localized in the acrosome of both mouse and human sperms ( Figure 4E ) . This phenomenon prompted us to investigate the role of CCDC62 in acro - some formation . Peanut agglutinin was used to visualize acrosome at different stages of acrosome formation . The different distribution patterns of CCDC62 in seminiferous tubules between WT and re - pro29 / repro29 mice were revealed by IF . In WT group , the CCDC62 signal was localized to the Golgi apparatus during the Golgi phase , and gradually expanded to form a cap - like structure that covered one pole of the nuclei in round spermatids during the cap phase . Ultimately , the signal turned into a crescent moon - shaped structure ( acrosome ) during the elongating and maturation phases ( Figure 5 , left panel ) . However , the CCDC62 signal was absent and did not colocalize with PNA in testes from repro29 / repro29 mice ( Figure 5 , right panel ) . The morphology of the spermatid nuclei was similar between WT and repro29 / repro29 mice during the Golgi , cap , and elongating phases , while the nuclei of repro29 / repro29 mice became condensed in the maturation phases ( Figure 5 ) . The ﬁnding that na - tive CCDC62 is colocalized with acrosome very well while the trun - cated protein not implies that the amino acids lost from the truncated CCDC62 protein may be important for acrosomal localization . Characterization of Ccdc62 knockout mice Ccdc62 knockout ( referred to as Ccdc62 − / − ) mice was generated by deleting the exon 2 of Ccdc62 gene with CRISPR - Cas9 technology ( Figure 6A ) . The genotypes of offspring mice were identiﬁed by PCR ( Figure 6B ) and further conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing ( Figure 6C ) . A fragment of 146 basepairs in exon 2 of Ccdc62 gene was deleted ( Figure 6C ) , which also results in a reading frame shift at 64th aa and a stop codon at 71st aa in CCDC62 protein . Sperm morphology , count , and motility analysis revealed that Ccdc62 − / − males displayed similar phenotype to repro29 / repro29 males ( Figure 7 ) . To further conﬁrm that the Ccdc62 mutation was responsible for male infertility in repro29 / repro29 mice , we designed and conducted a genetic complementation approach . Ccdc62 + / − males were mated with repro29 / repro29 females , or Ccdc62 + / − fe - males were mated with the repro29 / + males to produce compound heterozygous progeny ( referred to as Ccdc62 repro29 / – ) . To test their fertility , 8 - week - old Ccdc62 repro29 / – male mice were bred with WT females over a 2 - month period . Consistent with our prediction , Ccdc62 repro29 / – male mice were also sterile ( Table 2 ) . These data further conﬁrmed that the Ccdc62 mutation is a cause of the male - speciﬁc sterility in repro29 / repro29 mice and indicate that the non - sense mutation generates a loss - of - function of Ccdc62 gene . CCDC62 interacts with GOPC in mouse testis It is intriguing to notice that CCDC62 and the two acrosomal pro - teins , GOPC and protein interacting with C kinase 1 ( PICK1 ) , all 594 Y .

Both GOPC − / − [ 22 ] and PICK − / − mice [ 23 ] display male infertility , aberrant sperm phenotypes , and severely impaired sperm motility , which have previously been shown to be due to defects in acrosome biogenesis . This similarity prompted us to hypothesize that CCDC62 might interact with PICK1 and / or GOPC to regulate the formation of acrosome . We performed IF and Co - IP assays to investigate any protein – protein interactions between them . As shown in Figure 8A , CCDC62 was partially colocalized with PICK1 and GOPC in the testes of WT mice . For Co - IP experiments , the results showed that GOPC was coimmuno - precipitated with CCDC62 in the testes samples prepared from WT mice ( Figure 8B , lower panel ) , whereas no interaction be - tween PICK1 and CCDC62 protein was observed ( Figure 8B , up - per panel ) . These data suggest that CCDC62 interacts with GOPC , but not PICK1 , and the interactions may be important for acrosome biogenesis . Discussion The repro29 mice were previously generated by ENU mutagenesis , which is a nonbiased genetic approach to discover novel genes in male and female infertility . In the present study , we found that ENU treatment resulted in a C → T transition in the exon 6 of Ccdc62 gene of repro29 mice . It is in line with reported evidence that the occur - rence rate of G / C → A / T transition in germ line induced by ENU is 8 % , although it predominantly modiﬁes A / T base pairs [ 24 ] . Both repro29 / repro29 and Ccdc62 − / − mice are male infertile , and the sperm display poor motility and abnormal phenotypes , with exces - sive cytoplasm wrapped around the head . By mating repro29 mice with Ccdc62 knockout mice , the infertility of repro29 / repro29 mice caused by Ccdc62 mutation was further conﬁrmed by complemen - tation analysis . Although many genes have been characterized in different phase of spermiogenesis ( e . g . , Gopc and Pick1 ) , deﬁning the function of all of the genes involved in this important process is still of great signiﬁcance . In this study , we made our effort to identify a non - sense mutation in Ccdc62 gene of repro29 mice . Human Ccdc62 has two transcripts , called Ccdc62 - 1 and Ccdc62 - 2 . CCDC62 was reported as a novel cancer / testis antigen in human [ 25 ] . Functional experiments suggested that CCDC62 was a coactivator to promote estrogen receptor beta - mediated transactivation and regulated gene expression in prostate cancer cell lines [ 26 , 27 ] . Ccdc62 mutation was recently demonstrated to be associated with Parkinson’s disease in a Han Chinese population [ 28 – 30 ] . The mouse Ccdc62 mRNA is 3920 bp in size , encoding 701 aa with a deduced Mw 79 . 32 kDa . Until now , the function of Ccdc62 in the mouse remains unclear . We found that the mRNA expression level was signiﬁcantly reduced in repro29 / repro29 mice , which might be caused by nonsense - mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) [ 31 ] . When there exits a premature termina - tion codon in mRNA , NMD will be initiated to avoid accumulation of truncated protein in cells . Many proteins containing coiled - coil domain were reported to play a role in male fertility . For example , CCDC172 ( coiled - coil domain - containing 172 ) functions as a ﬂagella component pre - dominantly associated with mitochondria in the MP of ﬂagella [ 32 ] . CCDC135 ( coiled - coil domain - containing 135 ) mediates Pkd2 - dependent processes in the sperm ﬂagellum and other motile cilia [ 33 ] . These ﬁndings may shed some light on potential roles of CCDC62 in male fertility . GOPC and PICK1 are present at the Golgi apparatus and have roles in Golgi structure maintenance and vesicle trafﬁcking . They can interact with each other , and depletion of either protein re - sults in malformation of sperm [ 23 ] . These similarities , including protein structure , location , and phenotypes of deﬁcient mice , raise the possibility that there may exist interaction between CCD62 and GOPC / PICK1 . Thus , we did immunoﬂuoresence staining to display intracellular distribution of CCDC62 , which showed that CCDC62 was partially colocalized with GOPC and PICK1 . Further , Co - IP study exhibited that CCDC62 can interact with GOPC in mouse testis . Acrosome are completely lost in spermatids of GOPC knock - out mice due to failed vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus [ 22 ] , thereby suggesting CCDC62 may regulate acrosome formation via modulation the function of GOPC . However , the detailed under - lying mechanism is still unknown , and potential candidates which may interact with CCDC62 also need to be validated . Cytoplasmic removal is the last cellular reconstruction process during spermiogenesis , while its genetic and molecular mechanism remains poorly understood . It was documented that lacking of CCDC62 is associated with spermiogenesis , 2017 , Vol . 96 , No . 3 595 Figure 7 . Phenotypic analyses of Ccdc62 knockout mice .

The similar phenotypes of deformed sperm observed in Spem1 − / − and Ccdc62 − / − mice raise the possibility that cytoplasmic distributed - CCDC62 may be involved in the regulation of cytoplasm removal . In addition , a portion of sperms in several lines of nuclear protein ( e . g . , Tnp1 & 2 [ 35 ] , Prm1 & 2 [ 36 ] , Csnk2a2 [ 37 ] ) deﬁcient mice also show failure of cytoplasmic removal and display bent head and wrapping tail . These ﬁndings suggest that CCDC62 might affect cytoplasm removal via the pathways involved in nuclear packaging and condensation as well . Aberrant retention of excess cytoplasm leads to impaired sperm motility [ 12 ] . In this way , the extremely low sperm motility of re - pro29 / repro29 mice or Ccdc62 − / − mice is possibly caused by “the bag of cytoplasm” surrounding the head . It was strongly suggested that the disruption of F - actin organization is responsible for the failed cytoplasm removal in repro32 mice [ 12 ] . To gain a more comprehensive understanding of CCDC62’s function on cytoplasm removal , we searched the literature for the interaction of coiled - coil domains and F - actin . We found that coiled - coil domain - containing proteins not only colocalizes with F - actin but also have an impor - tant role in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton [ 38 – 40 ] . Still , the relationship between CCDC62 and F - actin remains an open question . 596 Y . Li et al . , 2017 , Vol . 96 , No . 3 Figure 8 . CCDC62 interacted with GOPC but not PICK1 in mouse testis . ( A ) CCDC62 was partially colocalized with GOPC and PICK1 in the perinuclear region of round spermatids . Testis from the mouse was ﬁxed , parafﬁn embedded , and subjected to IF . The nuclei were stained with Hoechst ( 1 μ g / ml ) . Scale bars : 5 μ m . ( B ) CCDC62 interacted with GOPC as demonstrated by Co - IP . CCDC62 , GOPC , or PICK1 in the extracts of testis from the WT or Ccdc62 − / - mice were pulled down by Dynabeads bound with speciﬁc antibodies . The eluted immunoprecipitates were then resolved on SDS - PAGE and detected with anti - CCDC62 , anti - GOPC , or anti - PICK1 as indicated in the ﬁgure . The results showed that CCDC62 was bound with GOPC , but not PICK1 in the testis from WT mice . This interaction was absent in the testis of Ccdc62 − / - mice . Taken together , our ﬁnding suggests that ( 1 ) the repro29 pheno - type is caused by a nonsense mutation in Ccdc62 gene ; ( 2 ) CCDC62 is required for maintenance for normal spermiogenesis and male fer - tility ; ( 3 ) CCDC62 is found to be interacted with GOPC , thereby playing a potential role in the acrosome formation ; ( 4 ) CCDC62 may have a role in several other events of spermiogenesis as well , including cytoplasm removal , tail stretching , and motility facilita - tion . The results also raise the question that the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying CCDC62 - mediated role in spermiogenesis is still under research .
