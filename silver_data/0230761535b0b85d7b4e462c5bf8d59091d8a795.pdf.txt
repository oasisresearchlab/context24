Phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - Bisphosphate Regulation of N - Methyl - D - aspartate Receptor Channels in Cortical Neurons Madhuchhanda Mandal and Zhen Yan Department of Physiology & Biophysics , State University of New York at Buffalo , Buffalo , New York Received June 19 , 2009 ; accepted September 18 , 2009 ABSTRACT The membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) has been implicated in the regulation of several ion channels and transporters . In this study , we exam - ined the impact of PIP 2 on N - methyl - D - aspartate receptors ( NMDARs ) in cortical neurons . Blocking PIP 2 synthesis by in - hibiting phosphoinositide - 4 kinase , or stimulating PIP 2 hydro - lysis via activation of phospholipase C ( PLC ) , or blocking PIP 2 function with an antibody caused a significant reduction of NMDAR - mediated currents . On the other hand , inhibition of PLC or application of PIP 2 caused an enhancement of NMDAR currents . These electrophysiological effects were accompanied by changes in NMDAR surface clusters induced by agents that manipulate PIP 2 levels . The PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR currents was abolished by the dynamin inhibitory peptide , which blocks receptor internalization . Agents perturbing actin stability pre - vented PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR currents , suggesting the actin - dependence of this effect of PIP 2 . Cofilin , a major actin depolymerizing factor , which has a common binding sequence for actin and PIP 2 , was required for PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR currents . It is noteworthy that the PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR channels was impaired in a transgenic mouse model of Alzhei - mer’s disease , probably because of the amyloid - (cid:1) disruption of PIP 2 metabolism . Taken together , our data suggest that con - tinuous synthesis of PIP 2 at the membrane might be important for the maintenance of NMDARs at the cell surface . When PIP 2 is lost , cofilin is released from the PIP 2 complex and is rendered free to depolymerize actin . With the actin cytoskeleton no longer intact , NMDARs are internalized via a dynamin / clathrin - dependent mechanism , leading to reduced NMDAR currents . The N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) , one of the major glutamate receptor channels in central neurons , plays a key role in multiple neuronal functions , including synapse formation , synaptic plasticity , learning , and memory . Dys - regulation of NMDARs has been implicated in ischemia , ep - ilepsy , and neuropsychiatric disorders ( Dingledine et al . , 1999 ; Lau and Zukin , 2007 ) . Synaptic targeting and incorpo - ration of NMDA receptors are dynamically regulated ( Wenthold et al . , 2003 ) . After being released from the endo - plasmic reticulum , NMDARs are rapidly transported along microtubule tracks in dendritic shafts ( Washbourne et al . , 2002 ; Yuen et al . , 2005 ) , followed by being delivered to actin - rich dendritic spines . NMDARs are tethered to actin cy - toskeleton via scaffolding and adaptor proteins , such as (cid:2) - ac - tinin and postsynaptic density - 95 ( Wyszynski et al . , 1997 ; Pak et al . , 2001 ) . Several mechanisms have been proposed to be important for stabilizing and / or promoting surface NMDA receptor expression , including the PDZ domain - mediated in - teractions between NR2 subunits and postsynaptic den - sity - 95 ( Kornau et al . , 1995 ; Roche et al . , 2001 ; Lin et al . , 2004 ) and tyrosine dephosphorylation of NR2 subunits that triggers clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Vissel et al . , 2001 ; Prybylowski et al . , 2005 ) . Actin dynamics also plays a key role in controlling NMDAR trafficking and function , because actin depolymerization reduces NMDA channel activity ( Rosenmund and Westbrook , 1993 ) , decreases the number of synaptic NMDAR clusters ( Allison et al . , 1998 ) , and triggers long - term depression of NMDA synaptic responses in hip - pocampus ( Morishita et al . , 2005 ) .

Although present in very small quan - tities , accounting for only 1 % of the total acidic membrane lipid , the dynamic change of PIP 2 concentration is known to affect many membrane proteins , including transporters and ion channels ( Suh and Hille , 2005 ) . Much evidence of this regulation has been obtained from studies on voltage - gated ion channels . K (cid:2) channels are most extensively studied in this respect : ATP - sensitive K ATP channels , inward rectifying K (cid:2) channels , G protein - gated inwardly rectifying channels , and members of the KCNQ family all require the constant synthesis of PIP 2 at the membrane for their full functionality ( Hilgemann and Ball , 1996 ; Huang et al . , 1998 ; Kobrinsky et al . , 2000 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . Voltage - gated Ca 2 (cid:2) channels , epithelial Na (cid:2) channels , and sensory transduction channels of the TRP family are also regulated by PIP 2 ( Wu et al . , 2002 ; Prescott and Julius , 2003 ; Kunzelmann et al . , 2005 ; Liu and Qin , 2005 ; Albert et al . , 2008 ) . Despite numerous reports on PIP 2 regulation of voltage - gated ion channels , the impact of PIP 2 on ligand - gated ion channels is largely unknown . It has been found that NMDAR activation during synaptic plasticity stimulates PIP 2 hydro - lysis by PLC , causing the loss of PSD scaffolding proteins and actin depolymerization in dendritic spines ( Horne and Dell’Acqua , 2007 ) , but it is unclear whether the increase or decrease of cellular PIP 2 content affects NMDAR trafficking and function . By mainly using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system , it has been shown that PIP 2 modulates NMDAR activity through (cid:2) - actinin ( Michailidis et al . , 2007 ) , whose actin - regulating function requires PIP 2 ( Fukami et al . , 1992 ) . In this study , we have provided evidence showing that PIP 2 facilitates NMDAR surface expression in native neu - rons , and loss of PIP 2 enhances clathrin / dynamin - dependent NMDAR internalization by promoting cofilin depolymeriza - tion of actin cytoskeleton . Moreover , we have found that the PIP 2 regulation of NMDARs is impaired by (cid:1) - amyloid , sug - gesting that the altered PIP 2 metabolism in AD ( Berman et al . , 2008 ) may contribute to the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline via aberrant NMDAR signaling . Materials and Methods Materials . Purified PIP 2 was obtained from Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA ) . Anti - PIP 2 antibody was from Assay Designs ( Ann Arbor , MI ) , and anti - cofilin antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology ( Danvers , MA ) . Latrunculin B , phalloidin , wortmannin , phenyl ar - sine oxide ( PAO ) , and carbachol were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . U73122 , U73343 , and dynamin inhibitory peptide were obtained from Tocris Cookson ( Ellisville , MO ) . Concentrated stocks of the reagents were made in DMSO or water and stored at (cid:3) 20°C . Stocks were thawed and diluted immediately before the experiment . The final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0 . 1 % . PIP 2 was diluted in distilled water ( 1 mg / ml ) and sonicated for 15 min to form liposomes ( 20 – 200 nm ) before application ( Liu and Qin , 2005 ) . AD Model and A (cid:1) Oligomer Preparation . (cid:1) - Amyloid precur - sor protein ( APP ) transgenic mice carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670N , M671L ) were purchased from Taconic ( Germantown , NY ) . Eight - week - old transgenic male mice ( on B6SJLF1 hybrid back - ground ) were bred with mature B6SJLF1 female mice . Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction according to the man - ufacturer’s protocol . Oligomeric A (cid:1) 1 – 42 was prepared as described previously ( Dahl - gren et al . , 2002 ) . In brief , the A (cid:1) 1 – 42 peptide ( AnaSpec Inc . , San Jose , CA ) was dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol to 1 mM . Hexaflu - oroisopropanol was then removed under vacuum . The remaining A (cid:1) 1 – 42 peptide was then resuspended in DMSO to 5 mM and diluted in H 2 O to 100 (cid:3) M . The oligermeric A (cid:1) was formed by incubating at 4°C for 24 h . Acute Dissociation Procedure . Frontal cortical neurons were dissociated from young adult ( 3 – 4 weeks old ) Sprague - Dawley rats or APP - transgenic mice ( 1 - year - old ) using procedures as described pre - viously ( Wang et al . , 2003 ; Gu et al . , 2009 ) . All experiments were performed with the approval of the State University of Buffalo Ani - mal Care Committee ( Buffalo , NY ) . Brain slices were incubated in NaHCO 3 - buffered saline , and then frontal cortex was dissected out and placed in an oxygenated chamber containing papain ( 0 . 8 mg / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) in Hanks’ balanced salt solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . After 40 - min enzyme digestion at room temperature , the tissue was rinsed three times with low Ca 2 (cid:2) , HEPES - buffered saline and me - chanically dissociated with a graded series of fire - polished Pasteur pipettes . Immediately after dissociation , the cell suspension was plated into a 35 - mm Lux Petri dish , which was then placed on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Ionic currents were measured 5 min after the initiation of whole - cell recordings . Each cell was recorded for 20 to 30 min . Primary Neuronal Culture . Rat frontal cortical cultures were prepared by methods described previously ( Gu et al . , 2009 ) . In brief , frontal cortex was dissected from 18 - day rat embryos , and cells were dissociated using trypsin and trituration through a Pasteur pipette . Neurons were plated on coverslips coated with poly ( L - lysine ) in Dul - becco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10 % fetal calf serum with a density of 3 (cid:4) 10 4 cells / cm 2 . When neurons were attached to the coverslip within 24 h , the medium was changed to Neurobasal me - dium with B27 supplement . Neurons were maintained for 3 to 4 weeks before being used for immunostaining . Whole - Cell Recording of Ionic Currents . Recordings of whole - cell NMDA - elicited ionic currents used standard voltage - clamp tech - niques ( Wang et al . , 2003 ) . The internal solution consisted of 180 mM N - methyl - D - glucamine , 40 mM HEPES , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM BAPTA , 12 mM phosphocreatine , 3 mM Na 2 ATP , 0 . 5 mM Na 2 GTP , and 0 . 1 mM leupeptin , pH 7 . 2 to 7 . 3 ( adjusted with H 2 SO 4 ) , 265 to 270 mOsm . The external solution consisted of 127 mM NaCl , 20 mM CsCl , 10 mM HEPES , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM BaCl 2 , 12 mM glucose , 0 . 001 mM tetrodotoxin , and 0 . 02 mM glycine , pH 7 . 3 to 7 . 4 , 300 to 305 mOsm . Recordings were obtained with an Axopatch 200B patch - clamp amplifier ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) that was con - trolled by an IBM personal computer running pCLAMP ( version 8 ) with a DigiData 1320 series interface ( Molecular Devices ) . Electrode resistances were typically 2 to 4 M (cid:5) in the bath . After seal rupture , series resistance ( 4 – 10 M (cid:5) ) was compensated ( 70 – 90 % ) and period - ically monitored . The cell membrane potential was held at (cid:3) 60 mV . NMDA ( 100 (cid:3) M ) was applied for 2 s every 30 s to minimize desen - sitization - induced decrease of current amplitude . Drugs were ap - plied with a gravity - fed “sewer pipe” system . The array of application capillaries ( 150 (cid:3) m inner diameter ) was positioned a few hundred microns from the cell under study . Solution changes were affected by the SF - 77B fast - step solution stimulus delivery device ( Warner In - struments , Hamden , CT ) . Recordings were performed at room tem - perature . Data analyses were performed with AxoGraph ( Molecular Devices ) and KaleidaGraph ( Albeck Software , Reading , PA ) . Student t tests or ANOVA tests were performed to compare the differential degrees of current modulation between groups subjected to different treatment . Electrophysiological Recordings in Slices . NMDAR - medi - ated synaptic currents in cortical slices were recorded using the whole - cell voltage - clamp recording technique ( Wang et al . , 2003 ; Gu et al . , 2009 ) . The slice ( 300 (cid:3) m ) was placed in a perfusion chamber attached to the fixed - stage of an Olympus upright microscope ( Olym - pus , Tokyo , Japan ) and submerged in continuously flowing oxygen - ated artificial cerebrospinal fluid . Cells were visualized with a 40 (cid:4) 1350 Mandal and Yan water - immersion lens and illuminated with near infrared light , and the image was detected with an infrared - sensitive charge - coupled device camera . A Multiclamp 700A amplifier was used for these recordings ( Molecular Devices ) . Tight seals ( 2 – 10 G (cid:5) ) from visual - ized pyramidal neurons were obtained by applying negative pres - sure . The membrane was disrupted with additional suction , and the whole - cell configuration was obtained . The access resistances ranged from 13 to 18 M (cid:5) . For NMDAR - EPSC recording , cells were bathed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 6 - cyano - 2 , 3 - dihydroxy - 7 - ni - troquinoxaline ( 20 (cid:3) M ) and bicuculline ( 10 (cid:3) M ) to block (cid:2) - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid / kainate receptors and GABA A receptors , respectively . Electrodes ( 5 – 9 M (cid:5) ) were filled with the following internal solution : 130 mM cesium - methanesulfonate , 10 mM CsCl , 4 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 2 . 2 mM QX - 314 , 12 mM phosphocreatine , 5 mM Mg - ATP , 0 . 2 mM Na 2 - GTP , and 0 . 1 mM leupeptin , pH 7 . 2 to 7 . 3 , 265 to 270 mOsm . Evoked currents were generated with a 0 . 6 - ms pulse from a stimulation isolation unit controlled by an S48 pulse generator ( As - tro - Med , West Warwick , RI ) . A bipolar stimulating electrode was positioned (cid:6) 100 (cid:3) m from the neuron under recording . Before stim - ulation , cells ( voltage - clamped at (cid:3) 70 mV ) were depolarized to (cid:2) 60 mV for 3 s to fully relieve the voltage - dependent Mg 2 (cid:2) block of NMDAR channels . Slice recordings were performed at room temper - ature . Clampfit Program ( Molecular Devices ) was used to analyze evoked synaptic activity . For electrophysiological data , the drug - induced percentage change was calculated in each cell , and the average ( mean (cid:7) S . E . ) of the percentage change in a sample of cells tested in each condition was given in the text . Immunocytochemical Staining . Cultured neurons on cover - slips ( days in vitro 21 – 30 ) were treated with drugs as described in the text . After treatment , the drugs were washed off , and cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and washed three to five times with PBS . Neurons were then incubated with 5 % bovine serum albumin for 1 h to block nonspecific staining . Next , neurons were labeled for surface NR1 clusters by incubating overnight at 4°C with anti - NR1 antibody directed against the extra - cellular loop ( amino acids 660 – 811 ) of NR1 ( clone 54 . 1 , 1 : 500 ; Milli - pore Corporation , Billerica , MA ) . This NR1 antibody gave a single band at (cid:6) 110 kDa in Western blot assays ( Yuen et al . , 2008 ) and gave punctated signals on dendritic spines of cultured cortical neu - rons in immunocytochemical studies ( Gu et al . , 2009 ) . Cells were then washed in PBS three times and incubated with Alexa - Fluor - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 200 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h at room temperature . After washing with PBS three times , the cover - slips were mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting media ( Vec - tor Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) . Labeled cells were imaged using a 100 (cid:4) objective lens with a cooled charge - coupled device camera mounted on a Nikon micro - scope . All specimens were imaged under identical conditions and analyzed using identical parameters . Surface NR1 clusters were measured using the ImageJ software ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . To define dendritic clusters , a single threshold was chosen manually so that clusters corresponded to puncta of 2 - fold greater intensity than the diffuse fluorescence on the dendritic shaft . Three to four inde - pendent experiments were performed . On each coverslip , the cluster density , size , and fluorescent intensity of four to six neurons ( two to three dendritic segments of 30 (cid:3) m length per neuron ) were mea - sured . Quantitative analyses were conducted blindly ( without knowl - edge of experimental treatment ) . Results Blocking PIP 2 Synthesis Inhibits NMDAR - Mediated Currents . To test whether changes in the concentration of PIP 2 at the cell membrane can affect NMDARs , we investi - gated the effects of pharmacological agents that interfere with PIP 2 synthesis on NMDAR - mediated currents in acutely dissociated cortical pyramidal neurons . PIP 2 in the plasma membrane is synthesized by the progressive phos - phorylation of phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) by phosphatidylino - sitol - 4 kinase ( PI - 4 kinase ) , and inhibition of this enzyme can potentially suppress the cellular synthesis of PIP 2 ( Nakan - ishi et al . , 1995 ; Meyers and Cantley , 1997 ) . As shown in Fig . 1 , A and B , dialysis with the PI - 4 kinase inhibitor wortmannin ( 10 (cid:3) M ) caused a progressive decrease of NMDAR current amplitudes ( I 3min , 2114 . 3 (cid:7) 303 . 6 pA ; Fig . 1 .

Regulation of NMDAR Channels by PIP 2 1351 I 15min , 1337 . 4 (cid:7) 155 . 6 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ) . The reduction reached a steady and significant ( p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) level after 15 min of dialysis ( average reduction , 35 . 1 (cid:7) 2 . 5 % ; Fig . 1E ) compared with dialysis with DMSO control ( I 3min , 2081 . 2 (cid:7) 375 . 2 pA , I 15min , 1968 . 3 (cid:7) 360 . 4 pA ; n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 6 . 0 (cid:7) 1 . 4 % ) . Because a high concentration of wortmannin blocks both PI - 3 and PI - 4 kinases ( Nakanishi et al . , 1995 ; Balla et al . , 1997 ) , we also dialyzed neurons with a low concentration ( 1 (cid:3) M ) of wortmannin , at which it inhibits only PI - 3 but not PI - 4 kinase . At this concentration , wortmannin caused little reduction of NMDAR current amplitudes ( I 3min : 1991 . 2 (cid:7) 287 . 1 pA ; I 15min , 1905 . 7 (cid:7) 279 . 8 pA ; n (cid:9) 6 ; average reduction , 4 . 4 (cid:7) 1 . 3 % ; Fig . 1E ) , which was similar to DMSO control . We also examined the effect of wortmannin on NMDAR current decay time constant ( (cid:4) ) . Dialysis with DMSO caused a significant ( p (cid:8) 0 . 01 ) decrease of (cid:4) over time ( (cid:4) 3min , 717 . 5 (cid:7) 94 . 1 ms ; (cid:4) 15min , 572 . 6 (cid:7) 78 . 2 ms , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 24 . 0 (cid:7) 3 . 7 % ) , which is presumably due to the inactivation of NMDAR channels caused by Ca 2 (cid:2) influx and calmodulin activation ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . A similar decrease of (cid:4) was found with 1 (cid:3) M wortmannin dialysis ( (cid:4) 3min , 838 . 6 (cid:7) 76 . 8 ms ; (cid:4) 15min , 644 . 6 (cid:7) 64 . 0 ms , n (cid:9) 6 ; average reduction , 23 . 1 (cid:7) 3 . 6 % ) or 10 (cid:3) M wortmannin dialysis ( (cid:4) 3min , 826 . 8 (cid:7) 102 . 8 ms ; (cid:4) 15min , 611 . 5 (cid:7) 100 . 6 ms , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 26 . 3 (cid:7) 6 . 1 % ) . No significant difference in the decrease rate of (cid:4) ( (cid:4) 15min / (cid:4) 3min ) was observed between the control groups and groups dialyzed with wortmannin , suggesting that wortman - nin did not alter the kinetics of NMDAR current . Wortmannin is also known to inhibit myosin light chain kinase ( Nakanishi et al . , 1992 ) ; thus , to ensure the specific involvement of PI - 4 kinase , we tested another chemically distinct inhibitor of PI - 4 kinase , PAO . PAO inhibits the syn - thesis of PIP 2 from PI , thus lowering the membrane concen - tration of PIP 2 ( Wiedemann et al . , 1996 ; Va´rnai and Balla , 1998 ) . As shown in Fig . 1C , bath application of PAO ( 10 (cid:3) M ) caused a significant ( p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) reduction of NMDAR current amplitudes ( I control , 2746 . 7 (cid:7) 234 . 4 pA ; I PAO , 1991 . 8 (cid:7) 191 . 9 pA , n (cid:9) 12 ; average reduction , 28 . 2 (cid:7) 1 . 2 % ; Fig . 1E ) . This effect of PAO was only partially reversible . Hydrolyzable ATP is required for the continuous synthesis of PIP 2 at the membrane ( Suh and Hille , 2002 ) ; thus , we tested whether a lack of ATP affects NMDAR currents . As shown in Fig . 1D , NMDAR currents recorded with an ATP - lacking internal solution showed a marked decrease ( I 3min , 1553 . 7 (cid:7) 265 . 3 pA ; I 15min , 465 . 3 (cid:7) 93 . 8 pA ; n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 69 . 5 (cid:7) 2 . 9 % ; Fig . 1E ) , whereas dialysis with nor - mal internal solution containing 3 mM ATP produced stable NMDAR currents ( I 3min , 1941 . 8 (cid:7) 365 . 0 pA ; I 15min , 1761 . 6 (cid:7) 299 . 1 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 7 . 3 (cid:7) 1 . 9 % ) . This is consistent with a previous study showing the requirement of intracellular ATP for cortical neuronal NMDA responses ( MacDonald et al . , 1989 ) . Because whole - cell NMDAR currents in isolated neurons are mediated by both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors , we further investigated the effect of PIP 2 on synaptic NMDAR responses . Excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked by stimulation of synaptic NMDARs ( NMDAR - EPSCs ) were recorded in cortical slices . As shown in Fig . 1F , PAO appli - cation induced a significant ( p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) reduction of the NMDAR - EPSC amplitude ( EPSC control , 250 . 5 (cid:7) 25 . 1 pA ; EPSC PAO , 146 . 5 (cid:7) 12 . 1 pA , n (cid:9) 9 ; average reduction , 40 . 1 (cid:7) 2 . 4 % ) . This effect of PAO was robust and only partially re - versible ( 30 – 40 % ) after prolonged washing , suggesting that inhibition of PIP 2 synthesis can produce a long - lasting effect on synaptic NMDA receptors . Stimulating PIP 2 Hydrolysis Inhibits NMDAR Cur - rents . To further explore the role of PIP 2 , we examined the effect of PIP 2 hydrolysis on NMDAR currents . M1 muscarinic receptors couple to the heterotrimeric G - protein G q / 11 and subsequently activate PLC - (cid:1) ( Peralta et al . , 1988 ; Rebecchi and Pentyala , 2000 ; Suh and Hille , 2002 ) . PLC - (cid:1) hydrolyzes PIP 2 into two second messengers , diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( IP 3 ) ( Lajat et al . , 1998 ; Rebecchi and Pentyala , 2000 ) . Given the wide distribution of M1 mus - carinic receptors in cortical neurons ( Levey et al . , 1991 ; Wei et al . , 1994 ) , we used the M1 muscarinic agonist carbachol to trigger PIP 2 hydrolysis and therefore decrease the PIP 2 con - tent . As shown in Fig . 2A , application of carbachol ( CCh , 20 (cid:3) M ) caused a significant ( p (cid:8) 0 . 01 ) reduction of NMDAR currents ( I control , 1873 . 8 (cid:7) 293 . 3 pA ; I CCh , 1328 . 9 (cid:7) 194 . 3 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 28 . 5 (cid:7) 2 . 9 % ; Fig . 2C ) . As with PAO , the effect of carbachol was only partially reversible . It sug - gests that once PIP 2 is broken down by activated PLC - (cid:1) , it produces a long - lasting effect on NMDAR currents and does not recover until PIP 2 is resynthesized at the membrane . To confirm the involvement of PLC , we applied the PLC inhibitor U73122 . As shown in Fig . 2 , B and C , U73122 ( 10 (cid:3) M ) caused a significant ( p (cid:8) 0 . 01 ) increase of NMDAR currents ( I control , 1098 . 8 (cid:7) 206 . 3 pA ; I U73122 , 1562 . 2 (cid:7) 309 . 0 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average increase , 41 . 6 (cid:7) 3 % ) , whereas its inactive analog U73343 ( 10 (cid:3) M ) failed to change NMDAR currents ( I control , 1108 . 7 (cid:7) 155 . 1 pA ; I U73343 , 1145 . 0 (cid:7) 166 . 8 pA , n (cid:9) 5 ; average increase , 2 . 9 (cid:7) 0 . 8 % ) .

PIP 2 Facilitates NMDAR Currents . To directly exam - ine the role of PIP 2 in the regulation of NMDAR channels , we measured the effect of exogenous application of PIP 2 on NMDAR currents . As shown in Fig . 3 , A and B , dialysis with PIP 2 ( 20 (cid:3) M ) caused a significant ( p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) increase of NMDAR currents ( I 3min , 1016 . 9 (cid:7) 118 . 2 pA ; I 20min , 1505 . 4 (cid:7) 199 . 2 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average increase , 46 . 7 (cid:7) 6 . 3 % ; Fig . 3C ) , whereas stable currents were obtained in the absence of PIP 2 within the same time frame ( I 3min , 1065 . 1 (cid:7) 163 . 2 pA ; I 20min , 932 . 3 (cid:7) 29 . 7 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 11 . 5 (cid:7) 2 . 2 % ; Fig . 3C ) . Next , we examined NMDAR currents when endogenous PIP 2 is blocked with a specific antibody ( Huang et al . , 1998 ; Liou et al . , 1999 ; Liu and Qin , 2005 ) . As shown in Fig . 3 , A and B , dialysis with PIP 2 antibody ( 28 . 5 (cid:3) g / ml ) caused a significant ( p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) decrease of NMDAR currents ( I 3min , 1402 . 6 (cid:7) 212 . 3 pA ; I 20min , 698 . 7 (cid:7) 96 . 5 pA , n (cid:9) 6 ; average reduction , 49 . 9 (cid:7) 1 . 3 % ; Fig . 3C ) compared with heat - inacti - vated PIP 2 antibody ( I 3min , 1982 . 6 (cid:7) 308 . 6 pA ; I 20min , 1756 . 0 (cid:7) 302 . 3 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 12 . 7 (cid:7) 1 . 5 % ; Fig . 3C ) . We also examined the effect of PIP 2 or PIP 2 antibody on NMDAR current decay time constant . A similar decrease of (cid:4) over time was observed in cells dialyzed with the control solution ( (cid:4) 3min , 804 . 1 (cid:7) 96 . 4 ms ; (cid:4) 20min , 612 . 4 (cid:7) 64 . 4 ms , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 21 . 7 (cid:7) 4 . 8 % ) , PIP 2 ( (cid:4) 3min , 812 . 4 (cid:7) 103 . 5 ms ; (cid:4) 20min , 585 . 8 (cid:7) 50 . 9 ms , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 23 . 9 (cid:7) 6 . 2 % ) , or PIP 2 antibody ( (cid:4) 3min , 784 . 7 (cid:7) 82 . 5 ms ; (cid:4) 20min , 570 . 3 (cid:7) 62 . 3 ms , n (cid:9) 6 ; average reduction , 25 . 8 (cid:7) 6 . 3 % ) , suggesting the lack of effect of PIP 2 on NMDAR current kinetics . To confirm the role of PIP 2 on synaptic NMDARs , we also tested the effects of PIP 2 and PIP 2 antibody on NMDAR - EPSCs in PFC slices . As shown in Fig . 3 , D and E , dialysis with PIP 2 significantly ( p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) enhanced NMDAR - EPSC ( EPSC 3min , 202 . 5 (cid:7) 35 . 3 pA ; EPSC 20min , 260 . 1 (cid:7) 42 . 4 pA , n (cid:9) 6 ; average increase , 28 . 7 (cid:7) 1 . 9 % ; Fig . 3F ) compared with control ( EPSC 3min , 234 . 7 (cid:7) 47 . 1 pA ; EPSC 20min , 221 . 0 (cid:7) 44 . 1 pA , n (cid:9) 6 ; average reduction , 5 . 8 (cid:7) 4 . 0 % ; Fig . 3F ) . Dialysis with PIP 2 antibody significantly ( p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) decreased NMDAR - EPSC ( EPSC 3min , 227 . 5 (cid:7) 21 . 3 pA ; EPSC 20min , 104 . 9 (cid:7) 21 . 4 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 51 . 2 (cid:7) 5 . 2 % ; Fig . 3F ) , similar to what was found on NMDAR - mediated ionic currents in isolated neurons . It suggests that the continuous presence of PIP 2 facilitates NMDAR responses at synapses . PIP 2 Regulates the Number of Surface NMDAR Clus - ters on Neuronal Dendrites . To determine whether PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR currents is caused by changes in NMDAR trafficking , we performed quantitative immuno - staining of surface NMDARs in cultured cortical neurons . Neurons were incubated with PAO ( 10 (cid:3) M ) or carbachol ( 20 (cid:3) M ) for 30 min . Surface NMDAR channels were assessed by immunostaining with an antibody against the NR1 extracel - lular N - terminal domain in nonpermeable conditions . As shown in Fig . 4 , A to C , surface NR1 punctated fluorescence on dendrites were observed in control neurons , whereas these puncta were noticeably reduced in neurons treated with PAO or carbachol . Quantitative analyses ( Fig . 4D ) showed that PAO significantly reduced the surface NR1 cluster density ( number of clusters / 25 (cid:3) m dendrite ) ( control , 14 . 1 (cid:7) 1 . 25 , n (cid:9) 14 ; PAO , 5 . 9 (cid:7) 1 . 4 , n (cid:9) 12 ; p (cid:8) 0 . 005 ) , and cluster size ( measured in square micrometers ) ( control , 0 . 38 (cid:7) 0 . 05 ; PAO , 0 . 14 (cid:7) 0 . 06 ; p (cid:8) 0 . 005 ) . The fluorescence intensity of surface NR1 clusters remained largely unchanged ( control , 93 . 8 (cid:7) 0 . 9 ; PAO , 89 . 9 (cid:7) 1 . 0 ) . Likewise , carbachol signifi - cantly diminished the surface NR1 cluster density ( 7 . 2 (cid:7) 1 . 8 , Fig . 3 . PIP 2 increases channel activity .

Regulation of NMDAR Channels by PIP 2 1353 n (cid:9) 11 ) and size ( 0 . 16 (cid:7) 0 . 02 , n (cid:9) 11 ) but not fluorescence intensity ( 91 . 1 (cid:7) 1 . 0 , n (cid:9) 11 ) . These data suggest that a loss of PIP 2 at the cell membrane , either by inhibiting its synthe - sis or by increasing its hydrolysis , reduces the surface ex - pression of NMDARs . PIP 2 Regulation of NMDAR Currents Involves Clath - rin / Dynamin - Dependent Internalization of NMDARs . Surface NMDA receptors are internalized via the clathrin / dynamin - dependent mechanism ( Roche et al . , 2001 ) . To de - termine whether the decrease of NMDAR channel currents and surface expression by loss of PIP 2 occurs as a result of enhanced NMDAR internalization , we dialyzed neurons with a dynamin inhibitory peptide , QVPSRPNRAP . This peptide is known to interfere with the binding of amphiphysin with dynamin , thereby preventing endocytosis ( Gout et al . , 1993 ) . As shown in Fig . 5 , A and B , the reducing effect of PAO on NMDAR currents was largely blocked in neurons dialyzed with 50 (cid:3) M dynamin inhibitory peptide ( I control , 1208 . 5 (cid:7) 167 . 6 pA ; I PAO , 1141 . 8 (cid:7) 146 . 6 pA , n (cid:9) 9 ; average reduction , 4 . 9 (cid:7) 1 . 7 % ; Fig . 5C ) , whereas a scrambled control peptide , RNPAQRPVPS , failed to alter the effect of PAO ( I control , 1568 (cid:7) 328 . 0 pA ; I PAO , 1168 . 5 (cid:7) 247 . 8 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 24 . 9 (cid:7) 1 . 8 % ; Fig . 5C ) . It suggests that PIP 2 regu - lation of NMDAR currents is caused by a change in clathrin / dynamin - dependent endocytosis of surface NMDARs . PIP 2 Regulates NMDAR Internalization through an Actin / Cofilin - Dependent Mechanism . Emerging evi - dence suggests that cytoskeletal molecules , such as actin and mictrotubules , are critically involved in the trafficking of membrane proteins ( Rogers and Gelfand , 2000 ) . It has been found that NMDAR channels are strongly regulated by the integrity of F - actin , and actin depolymerization reduces the number of functional NMDARs on the surface and at syn - apses ( Rosenmund and Westbrook , 1993 ; Allison et al . , 1998 ) . On the other hand , it has been found that PIP 2 plays a key role in restructuring and maintaining actin cytoskeleton by promoting actin branching , impairing actin severing pro - teins , uncapping actin filaments for the addition of new monomers , and regulating proteins that promote anchoring of actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane ( Sechi and Wehland , 2000 ; Yin and Janmey , 2003 ) . Thus , we tested whether the PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR internalization is through an actin - dependent mechanism . First , we compared the effect of PAO on NMDAR currents in the presence of agents that alter actin depolymerization . As shown in Fig . 6A , in neurons pretreated with the actin depolymerizer latrunculin B ( 5 (cid:3) M , 30 min ) , PAO had a much smaller effect on NMDAR currents ( I control , 684 . 9 (cid:7) 102 . 0 pA ; I PAO , 672 . 9 (cid:7) 102 . 6 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 1 . 6 (cid:7) 1 . 5 % ; Fig . 6B ) compared with untreated neurons ( I control , 1368 . 0 (cid:7) 179 . 6 pA ; I PAO , 984 . 3 (cid:7) 132 . 5 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 28 . 2 (cid:7) 1 . 6 % ; Fig . 6B ) . Note that the basal current amplitude of latrunculin - treated neurons was signif - icantly ( p (cid:8) 0 . 01 ) smaller than that of untreated neurons , suggesting that a loss of F - actin results in a loss of functional NMDARs . Consistent with this , when latrunculin B was directly applied to neurons under recording , it reduced NMDAR currents by (cid:6) 50 % , and subsequent addition of PAO did not cause any further reduction ( data not shown ) . On the other hand , dialysis with the F - actin stabilizer phalloidin ( 2 (cid:3) M ) largely blocked the effect of PAO on NMDAR currents ( Fig . 6C ) ( I control , 1492 . 0 (cid:7) 300 . 2 pA ; I PAO , 1416 . 5 (cid:7) 289 . 9 pA , n (cid:9) 8 ; average reduction , 4 . 9 (cid:7) 1 . 1 % ; Fig . 6D ) compared with dialysis with the normal internal solution ( Fig . 6C ) ( I control , 1652 . 2 (cid:7) 310 . 2 pA ; I PAO , 1232 . 5 (cid:7) 234 . 3 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 25 . 0 (cid:7) 2 . 3 % ; Fig . 6D ) . Actin depolymerization is regulated by multiple proteins , one of which is cofilin , a major actin depolymerizing factor ( Sarmiere and Bamburg , 2004 ; DesMarais et al . , 2005 ) . It is noteworthy that actin and PIP 2 have been demonstrated to bind to cofilin at the same site ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) . PIP 2 competitively inhibits actin binding to cofilin ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991a , b ) , and cofilin remains preferentially bound to PIP 2 when PIP 2 is present ( Kusano et al . , 1999 ) . We speculate that the loss of PIP 2 enables actin depolymerization by releasing the bound cofilin , leading to NMDAR current reduction . To test this , we dialyzed neurons with an antibody against cofi - lin to block the function of endogenous cofilin ( Chan et al . , 2000 ; Pendleton et al . , 2003 ) . As shown in Fig . 6E , the effect of PAO on NMDAR currents was significantly attenuated by the 50 (cid:3) M cofilin antibody ( I control , 1611 . 7 (cid:7) 343 . 2 pA ; I PAO , 1447 . 9 (cid:7) 309 . 1 pA , n (cid:9) 8 ; average reduction , 10 . 6 (cid:7) 1 . 4 % ; Fig . 6F ) but not by the heat - inactivated cofilin antibody ( I control , 1795 . 7 (cid:7) 198 . 1 pA ; I PAO , 1317 . 3 (cid:7) 121 . 0 pA , n (cid:9) 9 ; average reduction , 25 . 6 (cid:7) 1 . 9 % ; Fig . 6F ) . These results sug - gest that the PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR trafficking is through a mechanism depending on the cofilin - regulated ac - tin dynamics . PIP 2 Regulation of NMDAR Currents Is Impaired by A (cid:1) . Reduced levels of PIP 2 have been found in the frontal cortex of AD brains ( Stokes and Hawthorne , 1987 ; Berman et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , oligomeric amyloid - (cid:1) ( A (cid:1) ) peptide is Fig . 4 . Blocking PIP 2 synthesis or stimulating PIP 2 hydrolysis decreases the surface NMDAR clusters on dendrites .

Thus , we examined whether the PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR channels is altered in AD - related conditions . As shown in Fig . 7 , A and B , in neurons treated with A (cid:1) ( 1 (cid:3) M , 60 min ) , PAO failed to reduce NMDAR currents ( I control , 1047 . 9 (cid:7) 151 . 7 pA ; I PAO , 1008 . 0 (cid:7) 145 . 8 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 3 . 1 (cid:7) 1 . 4 % ; Fig . 7C ) in contrast to the effect of PAO in untreated neurons ( I control , 1434 . 4 (cid:7) 125 . 5 pA ; I PAO , 1085 . 0 (cid:7) 117 . 4 pA , n (cid:9) 7 ; average reduction , 25 . 0 (cid:7) 2 . 9 % ; Fig . 7C ) . These results are in agreement with our expectation that A (cid:1) pretreatment disrupts basal levels of cellular PIP 2 Fig . 5 .

Regulation of NMDAR Channels by PIP 2 1355 ( Berman et al . , 2008 ) , which might explain why no further modulation by PAO is observed . We further validated these in vitro findings in an animal model of AD , with the transgenic mice overexpressing mu - tant APP . As shown in Fig . 7 , D and E , PAO failed to cause a reduction of NMDAR currents in cortical neurons from APP transgenic mice ( I control , 1334 . 8 (cid:7) 177 . 6 pA ; I PAO , 1291 . 1 (cid:7) 178 . 8 pA , n (cid:9) 11 ; average reduction , 3 . 6 (cid:7) 1 . 1 % ; Fig . 7F ) , which was significantly ( p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) different from the effect of PAO in neurons from wild - type mice ( I control , 1636 . 0 (cid:7) 213 . 5 pA ; I PAO , 1221 . 3 (cid:7) 149 . 8 pA , n (cid:9) 8 ; average reduction , 24 . 6 (cid:7) 1 . 5 % ; Fig . 7F ) . These results suggest that the PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR channels is lost in AD , probably be - cause of the disrupted PIP 2 metabolism by A (cid:1) . Discussion In this study , we have provided electrophysiological evi - dence demonstrating that the NMDAR response is regulated by the increase or decrease of PIP 2 concentrations in cortical neurons . Blocking PIP 2 synthesis or stimulating PIP 2 hydro - lysis reduces NMDAR - mediated currents , whereas inhibition of PLC or exogenous application of PIP 2 enhances NMDAR currents . The PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR responses seems to be attributable to NMDAR internalization via the clathrin / dynamin - dependent mechanism . We have further demon - strated that the PIP 2 - induced change in NMDAR endocytosis is probably caused by the change in actin depolymerization that is regulated by cofilin . Based on these results , we propose a model ( Fig . 8 ) that schematically represents the potential mechanism by which PIP 2 influences the number of surface NMDA receptors in native neurons . Under basal conditions , PI ( 4 ) P5 kinase uses cellular ATP to convert PI ( 4 ) P to PIP 2 . As long as the rate of PIP 2 synthesis is unperturbed and PIP 2 concentration in the plasma membrane is high , cofilin remains bound to PIP 2 preferentially over actin , and thus is unable to depolymerize F - actin . With the actin cytoskeleton intact at the PSD , NMDAR channels are stabilized at the synaptic membrane by binding to adaptor proteins like (cid:2) - actinin ( Wyszynski et al . , 1997 ; Michailidis et al . , 2007 ) . Activation of PLC causes the hydrolysis of PIP 2 into DAG and IP 3 , leading to the release of cofilin , which now becomes available to bind to F - actin and depolymerize it . With the actin cytoskeleton dis - integrated , NMDA receptors are internalized via clathrin - coated pits , causing the reduction of NMDAR responses . Ac - tivation of many G q - coupled receptors , such as M1 muscarinic receptors ( mAChRs ) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors , trigger PLC activation and PIP 2 hydro - lysis ; thus , these receptors may suppress NMDAR responses via the common PIP 2 - dependent mechanism . It provides a potential explanation for mAChR - and metabotropic gluta - mate receptors - mediated inhibition of NMDA component of glutamatergic transmission in ventral tegmental area neu - rons ( Zheng and Johnson , 2003 ; Levy et al . , 2006 ) . There is the possibility that cholinergic agonists like carbachol mod - ulate NMDAR currents via intracellular Ca 2 (cid:2) release and PKC activation . However , it has been demonstrated that PIP 2 hydrolysis by stimulation of PLC - coupled receptors still inhibits NR1 / NR2A currents even in cells pretreated with thapsigargin , the drug that depletes Ca 2 (cid:2) from intracellular stores and suppresses NR1 / 2C currents , which are insensi - tive to regulation by PKC ( Michailidis et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , the effect of carbachol on NMDAR currents is probably caused by PIP 2 hydrolysis . Because reducing PIP 2 levels causes the internalization of NMDARs from the plasma membrane , PIP 2 must act to Fig . 7 . PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR channels is abolished by A (cid:1) and in APP transgenic mice .

Actin is a likely candidate because of its involve - ment in maintaining the surface / synaptic localization and function of NMDARs ( Rosenmund and Westbrook , 1993 ; Al - lison et al . , 1998 ; Morishita et al . , 2005 ) . Moreover , PIP 2 has been found to play a critical role in modulating actin dynam - ics ( Takenawa and Itoh , 2001 ; Yin and Janmey , 2003 ) . In - creased cellular PIP 2 by overexpression of PI ( 4 ) 5 - kinase in heterologous systems can induce the formation of actin fila - ment bundles , whereas the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin disrupts them ( Allison et al . , 1998 ; Janmey et al . , 1999 ) . PIP 2 facilitates actin polymerization by inhibiting actin capping proteins ( e . g . , CapZ and gelsolin ) , nucleotide exchange proteins ( e . g . , profilin ) , and actin filament - severing proteins ( e . g . , cofilin ) ( Janmey et al . , 1999 ; Sechi and Weh - land , 2000 ) . In addition , PIP 2 activates cross - linking proteins ( e . g . , (cid:2) - actinin ) and proteins that bind the actin cytoskeleton to plasma membrane ( e . g . , vinculin and ezrin / radixin / moe - sin ) ( Sechi and Wehland , 2000 ; Takenawa and Itoh , 2001 ) . Our data suggest the involvement of cofilin in PIP 2 regu - lation of NMDARs in cortical neurons . The importance of cofilin in regulating actin dynamics cannot be undermined because it is the major actin depolymerizing factor abun - dantly distributed in the soma , axons , and dendrites of cen - tral and peripheral neurons ( Sarmiere and Bamburg , 2004 ) . Cofilin , which acts to enhance actin monomer dissociation and reduce actin - actin interactions ( DesMarais et al . , 2005 ) , is tightly regulated . Apart from its regulation by phosphor - ylation / dephosphorylation ( Huang et al . , 2006 ; Endo et al . , 2007 ) , a separate membrane - bound pool of cofilin is regu - lated by its binding status to PIP 2 ( Sarmiere and Bamburg , 2004 ; Hosoda et al . , 2007 ; van Rheenen et al . , 2007 ) . Cofilin has a short sequence at the N terminus that is the common binding site for both PIP 2 and actin ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991a , b ) . Biochemical studies show that in the presence of PIP 2 , cofilin binds preferentially to PIP 2 , which inhibits its actin - binding activity ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991a ; DesMarais et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , we speculate that active cofilin is bound to PIP 2 in an inhibitory “caged” complex in resting conditions ; upon PIP 2 hydrolysis , it is “uncaged” to become available to bind to F - actin and depolymerize it . Consistent with this , it has been found that epidermal growth factor - induced PLC activation causes the release of cofilin , leading to F - actin disintegration in carcinoma cells ( van Rheenen et al . , 2007 ) . The current knowledge about NMDAR - PIP 2 interactions is largely based on the work of Michailidis et al . ( 2007 ) , who discovered that PIP 2 affects NMDAR channels through (cid:2) - ac - tinin in the X . laevis oocyte expression system . Our present study has investigated the intracellular mechanism underly - ing the regulation of native NMDARs by PIP 2 in cortical neurons . Both Michailidis et al . ( 2007 ) and we have found that PIP 2 inhibition leads to the suppression of NMDAR currents . There are a few differences between the two stud - ies . Michailidis et al . ( 2007 ) found that PLC - catalyzed PIP 2 hydrolysis ( by stimulation of epidermal growth factor recep - tor or M1 mAChRs ) only elicited a transient inhibition of NMDAR currents , although we found that the mAChR ago - nist carbachol caused a sustained inhibition of NMDAR cur - rents and only partially recovered upon washing off the drug ( Fig . 2 ) . This indicates that the effect of PIP 2 hydrolysis is long - lasting , and the NMDAR channels do not become fully functional until another biosynthetic cycle of PIP 2 is com - pleted . As to the mechanism underlying PIP 2 regulation of NMDARs , Michailidis et al . ( 2007 ) suggest that (cid:2) - actinin tethers to C - terminal regions of NMDARs and PIP 2 in the plasma membrane to keep the channel fully open ; when PIP 2 is hydrolyzed by PLC , (cid:2) - actinin is detached from the mem - brane and is no longer able to keep the channel “open , ” resulting in the shift of NMDAR conformation to a “re - strained” state , which accounts for the suppression of the current . Our model ( Fig . 8 ) , on the other hand , demonstrated that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is directly linked to PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR channels . We propose that depletion of membrane PIP 2 affects the polymerization state of F - actin via cofilin , therefore affecting the membrane traf - ficking of NMDARs . Because F - actin is required for anchor - ing NMDARs at the surface / synapses ( Rosenmund and West - brook , 1993 ; Allison et al . , 1998 ) , decreased actin cytoskeletal support should be accompanied by enhanced internalization of NMDAR channels . This is consistent with our findings that blocking the clathrin / dynamin - dependent internaliza - tion prevents PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR currents ( Fig . 5 ) . Fig . 8 . A schematic model demonstrating the potential mechanism for PIP 2 regulation of NMDAR channels . A , PIP 2 is being constantly synthesized at the membrane by phosphor - ylation of PIP by PI ( 4 ) P5 - kinase at the expense of ATP hydrolysis . The presence of membrane PIP 2 binds to cofilin and holds it in an inactive “caged” state , preventing its binding to F - actin . Intact actin helps maintain NMDARs at the synaptic membrane . B , when PIP 2 is hydrolyzed ( step 1 ) to DAG and IP 3 by activa - tion of PLC , cofilin is free to bind ( step 2 ) to actin , causing depolymerization and severing ( step 3 ) of actin filaments . With the cytoskeleton support lost , NMDAR channels are in - ternalized ( step 4 ) , thus caus - ing a reduction of NMDAR currents . Regulation of NMDAR Channels by PIP 2 1357 Thus , PIP 2 may affect the functionality of NMDAR channels in more than one way , because both PIP 2 and NMDARs are known to interact with a diverse array of molecules . It must be noted that even though our model predicts that cofilin directly binds to PIP 2 , the possibility of an intermediary binding partner cannot be ignored . The potential correlation between reduced levels of phos - phoinositides in the brain and symptoms of Alzheimer’s dis - ease has been established ( Stokes and Hawthorne , 1987 ; Landman et al . , 2006 ; Berman et al . , 2008 ) . With the level of PIP 2 diminished by A (cid:1) , it is not surprising that a subsequent application of PI - 4 kinase inhibitors to block PIP 2 synthesis fails to exert a strong influence on NMDAR currents . Because PIP 2 concentration on the cytosolic leaflet at the plasma membrane undergoes a constant cycle of regenera - tion and breakdown ( Toker , 1998 ; Suh and Hille , 2005 ) , it is conceivable that any perturbation of this pathway is likely to affect the functioning of ion channels that are directly or indirectly regulated by this phospholipid . Overall , our study has identified one possible mechanism by which PIP 2 regu - lates NMDAR channel trafficking and function in central neurons . Acknowledgments We thank Dr . Eunice Yuen , Dr .
