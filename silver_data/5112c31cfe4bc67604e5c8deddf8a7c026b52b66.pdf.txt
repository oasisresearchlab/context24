Extradural decompression of osseous as well as soft tissue components has historically been the principal objective of surgi - cal procedures . Nevertheless , this particular surgical procedure fails to tackle the intradural compressive alterations that contribute to secondary SCI . Here , we propose an early intrathecal decompression strategy and evaluate its role on function outcome , tissue sparing , inflammation , and tissue stiffness after SCI . Durotomy surgery significantly promoted recovery of hindlimb locomotor function in an open - field test . Radiological analysis suggested that lesion size and tissue edema were significantly reduced in animals that received durotomy . Relative to the group with laminectomy alone , the animals treated with a duro - tomy had decreased cavitation , scar formation , and inflammatory responses at 4 weeks after SCI . An examination of the mechanical properties revealed that durotomy facilitated an expeditious restoration of the injured tissue’s elastic rigidity . In general , early decompressive durotomy could serve as a significant strategy to mitigate the impairments caused by secondary injury and estab - lish a more conducive microenvironment for prospective cellular or biomaterial transplantation .

The worldwide incidence of SCI is estimated to be between 250 , 000 and 500 , 000 persons annually . 1 – 3 Despite numerous fundamental scientific and clinical breakthroughs in the treatment of SCI , currently , there is a deficiency of a solitary efficient therapeutic strategy to avert the severe paralysis linked with this type of injury . SCI frequently occurs in two stages . The initial stage involves the immediate obliteration of cells and tissues due to a single traumatic incident , including a car crash or sports - related accident . The subsequent stage , known as the secondary phase , involves various cellular and molec - ular consequences of the initial injury , such as swelling , bleeding , inflammation , degeneration of nerve fibers , for - mation of scar tissue , and the development of cysts . These secondary effects lead to the enlargement of the initial injury site over a longer period of time , ranging from days to weeks . 4 – 6 The injured spinal cord may become swollen inside the thecal sac due to the edema and hemorrhage , contributed to occlusion of the subarachnoid . 7 Intraspinal pressure ( ISP ) is increased when the rigid dural sleeve is compressed against the enlarged , injured cord . 8 The condition , which has been observed in pigs , 9 humans , 10 and rats 11 is known as “spinal compartment syndrome . ” 12 Elevated ISP leads to a decline in self - regulation of blood vessels and ineffective uneven blood flow in the injured spinal cord , worsening the impact of oxidative stress and subsequent harm . 9 Recently , heightened ISP has been linked to adverse neurological consequences in individ - uals with SCI . 13 – 16 Moreover , the meticulous handling of escalated ISP following SCI seems to align with enhanced functional outcomes . 17 , 18 Through a deeper comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of acute SCI , it is believed that surgical decompression may help mitigate the impact of subse - quent injuries . 19 The primary approach in current surgical procedures typically includes relieving pressure on the bone canal through laminectomies , correcting the defor - mity , and stabilizing the spine . 20 Osseous decompression alleviates pressure from edema and hemorrhage and pre - vents blood or oxygen shortages . However , this particular surgical procedure does not relieve elevated ISP , which is witnessed in roughly 50 % of individuals with SCI . 10 There - fore , to efficiently reduce immediately heightened ISP after SCI , it is imperative to perform a durotomy by open - ing the dural lining of the spinal cord . Moreover , based on a thorough examination of existing preclinical data , the timing of spinal cord compression emerges as a cru - cial factor influencing the recuperation process following SCI . 21 , 22 Following acute SCI , the first 24 h after injury are critical for achieving optimal neurological recovery with decompressive surgery . 22 , 23 Presently , there is ongoing debate regarding the prospec - tive neurological benefits of durotomy . Smith et al . 24 examined the recovery implications of durotomy with duroplasty in 72 rodents suffering from cervical SCI . The rats that underwent a dural incision and got a dural graft exhibited less cavitation , inflammation , and scar formation , as well as superior functional recovery in com - parison with the group that only received contusion . Similarly , Zhang et al . 25 conducted a recent study where they performed durotomy on rats . The researchers found that intrathecal decompression , achieved through a dural incision , led to enhanced neurological function . Micro - scopic investigations indicated that the rats exhibited more preservation of white matter , as well as a reduced pres - ence of vacuoles and less damage to axons . Nevertheless , Jalan et al . 26 suggested that surgical decompression did not yield any advantages in terms of neurological enhance - ment in rats with severe thoracic spinal cord contusion injury 24 h after the injury occurred . Overall , these find - ings only assessed the behavior test and / or conducted a single histological examination ( without quantitative ver - ification ) , but they did not offer enough information to elucidate the significance of early surgical decompression of the intradural region following SCI . Therefore , further investigation is recommended . In the current study , we propose to comprehensively ascertain the potential implications of surgical decompres - sion with early durotomy in the treatment of acute thoracic SCI and its impacts on functional recovery , edema , inflam - mation , scar formation , cystic cavitation , and tissue elastic stiffness based on a combination of behavioral analyses , radiological assessment , histopathological examination , and mechanical indentation testing ( Figure 1 ) . The study hypothesized that durotomy conducted 24 h postinjury would enhance functional , histological , radiological , and tissue mechanical property outcomes in an animal model of acute severe thoracic SCI . 2 RESULTS 2 . 1 Durotomy improved locomotor function and bladder recovery after SCI There were no notable variations in the preinjury Basso – Beattie – Bresnahan ( BBB ) scores between the groups , as depicted in Figure 2A . Throughout the duration of the study , there were no observed alterations in hindlimb loco - motor function among the sham control group . The BBB JIN et al . 3 of 16 FIGURE 1 Schematic representation of experimental design . ( A ) Clip - compression model for SCI .

( E ) BASIC scoring system upon axial T2 - weighted MRIs .

( F ) Experimental setup for ex vivo spinal cord 4 of 16 JIN et al . scoring performed 7 days following SCI manifested that the animals that had received a durotomy had better but not statistically significant motor functional recovery than those that had received a laminectomy alone ( 5 . 1 ± 1 . 6 com - pared with 4 . 5 ± 1 . 5 , p = 0 . 694 ) . The variation between SCI + durotomy and SCI + laminectomy groups was sig - nificant at 14 days ( 10 . 6 ± 1 . 9 compared with 7 . 8 ± 1 . 1 , p = 0 . 001 ) , 21 days ( 11 . 2 ± 2 . 0 compared with 8 . 8 ± 1 . 4 , p = 0 . 007 ) , and 28 days ( 11 . 9 ± 2 . 0 compared with 9 . 5 ± 1 . 3 , p = 0 . 005 ) ( Figure 2A ) . None of the animals in either group fully recovered their baseline levels . A common characteristic of thoracic crush models is that rats are unable to voluntarily empty the bladder fol - lowing an injury . During the initial 14 - day period , we assessed the remaining urine quantities in all animals fol - lowing laminectomy and durotomy procedures . The urine volume of the SCI + laminectomy group was signifi - cantly greater than the SCI + durotomy group at 3 days ( 2 . 29 ± 0 . 45 compared with 0 . 84 ± 0 . 22 , p < 0 . 001 ) and 7 days ( 1 . 47 ± 0 . 37 compared with 0 . 42 ± 0 . 15 , p < 0 . 001 ) . No significant variation between SCI + laminectomy and SCI + durotomy groups at 14 days ( 0 . 07 ± 0 . 08 com - pared with 0 . 03 ± 0 . 05 , p = 0 . 202 ) . Interestingly , the results demonstrated that durotomy plus laminectomy led to significantly faster recovery of bladder function than laminectomy alone ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 2B ) . 2 . 2 Durotomy reduced lesion size and tissue edema after SCI Different lesion regions ( i . e . , edema [ high signal intensity ] and / or subdural hemorrhage [ low signal intensity ] ) of the spinal cord in the SCI + laminectomy and SCI + duro - tomy groups were found in sagittal and axial T2 - weighted images ( Figure 3A ) . Quantitative analysis revealed that lesion length , lesion width , and the metrices of the lesion area were significantly less in the group that had durotomy compared with the SCI + laminectomy group on days 7 and 28 postinjury ( p < 0 . 05 ; Figures 3B – D ; Table S1 ) . Fur - thermore , four distinct patterns of intramedullary signals ( i . e . , Brain and Spinal Injury Center [ BASIC ] 1 − 4 ) were identified on the axial T2 - weighted sequence at the injury epicenter . No statistically significant difference was found in the BASIC score between the two groups on days 7 and 28 postinjury ( p > 0 . 05 ; Figure 3E ) . Edema is suggested by the presence of fluid accumu - lation in the white matter surrounding the lesion site throughout the acute phase after the initial injury , as indi - cated by the increased T2 signals . We reasoned that local tissue edema was alleviated by early intrathecal decom - pression . To test this , we compared the percent water content of the ∼ 20 . 0 mm cord segment centered over the lesion center between the SCI + laminectomy and SCI + durotomy groups and found that SCI gave rise to significantly pronounced tissue edema compared with baseline in both groups . On day 3 , the water content of the lesion center in the SCI + laminectomy group had increased to an average of 76 . 4 ± 3 . 5 % , which was notably higher than that in the SCI + durotomy group ( 71 . 0 ± 2 . 5 % , p = 0 . 011 ; Figure 3F ; Table S2 ) . By day 7 , tissue edema at the lesion center in rats that had received a crush SCI alone was still significantly higher than that in rats that had received an early decompression ( 72 . 2 ± 2 . 4 % compared with 68 . 5 ± 1 . 3 % , p = 0 . 007 ; Figure 3F ; Table S2 ) . 2 . 3 The impact of durotomy on reactive astrogliosis , macrophage accumulation , as well as extracellular matrix deposition following SCI After a period of 28 days following SCI without any addi - tional treatments , there was a significant presence of CD68 - positive macrophages observed through stereologi - cal quantification in the area surrounding the lesion site ( Figure 4 ) . Furthermore , a great number of macrophages were observed near and far from the injury site along the white matter pathways undergoing anterograde ( Wal - lerian ) degeneration ( Figures 4A and B ) . Figure 4C shows that there were considerably fewer CD68 - positive macrophages in the SCI + durotomy group contrasted with the SCI + laminectomy group , both within and around the lesion ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The presence of microglial acti - vation was further confirmed by double staining using immunostaining for CD68 and CD11b , two widely rec - ognized markers of active microglia . The results showed that most of the CD68 - positive cells in the epicenter and surrounding the cystic cavities simultaneously expressed CD11b , indicating that they were activated microglial cells ( Figures 4D and E ) . The study also examined the effect of durotomy on the degree of reactive astrogliosis , which was quantified by staining glial fibrillary acidic protein . On the 28th day after the injury , a significant number of hypertrophic astro - cytes expressing GFAP protein were observed around the tissue indentation testing .

The control lesions in the SCI + laminectomy group were sur - rounded by reactive astrocytes , as indicated by the strong expression of GFAP around the cystic cavities ( Figure 5A ) . While the occurrence of cystic cavitation was reduced in the spinal cords treated with durotomy , the presence of perilesional GFAP was still detected . The quantitative analysis revealed no significant disparity in the quantity of GFAP - positive astrocytes between the two groups . This suggests that durotomy may not have an impact on reactive astrogliosis following SCI ( p = 0 . 192 ; Figure 5E ) . Fibronectin was used to characterize the spatiotempo - ral distribution of extracellular matrix and fibrous scars in the injured region of the spinal cord after durotomy . Twenty - eight days postinjury , there was a notable pres - ence of fibronectin in all spinal cord lesions , as well as in a widespread connective tissue matrix in both the SCI + durotomy and SCI + laminectomy groups . In the SCI + laminectomy group , a fibronectin connective tis - sue band was discovered , which connected the dural leaflets and spanned across the two sides of the initial crush injury ( Figure 5C ) . In the SCI + durotomy group , marked fibronectin - positive areas became more concen - trated toward the central core lesion because of the dural defect ( Figure 5D ) . Moreover , fibronectin expression in the SCI + laminectomy group was much heightened compared with the durotomy treatment group ( p < 0 . 001 ; Figure 5F ) , indicating less dense fibrous scar formation after early intrathecal decompression . 2 . 4 Durotomy reduces cavity formation after SCI Stereological analysis was conducted on crush injuries , both with and without durotomy , to assess the degree of cystic cavitation and investigate the potential impact of early intrathecal decompression on the formation of cystic cavities . After 28 days of SCI , a histological examination showed a concentrated cellular infiltration in the spinal cord lesion . Throughout the area represented by the dorsal columns and dorsal spinal gray matter , Figure 6A revealed extensive cystic cavities with many septae in the tissues of the spinal cords of patients with SCI . In contrast , durotomy led to a noticeable reduction in cystic cavitation , with only a few small microcystic formations remaining at the site of the lesion ( Figure 6B ) . Quantitative comparative analysis of the LAs revealed that the spinal cord cavity area in the SCI + durotomy group was significantly smaller than that in the SCI + laminectomy group ( p < 0 . 001 ; N = 5 per group ; Figure 6C ) , suggesting that early intrathe - cal decompression may reduce cavity formation after SCI . 2 . 5 Effect of durotomy on tissue elastic properties of the spinal cord after SCI The tissues were categorized into two segments based on their visual characteristics : the injury region ( IR ) , which had a width of roughly 2 . 0 mm and encircled the central part of the lesion , and the area outside the injury region ( AFIR ) . Throughout all the time points analyzed following the injury , there was no discernible disparity in mechanical 6 of 16 JIN et al .

Indentation stiffness maps of the IR on day 3 following injury demonstrated a significant decline in tissue elastic - ity in the SCI + laminectomy and SCI + durotomy groups , with a decline of over twofold the amount of the uninjured region or control animals ( p < 0 . 001 ; Figures 7A and S2 ; Tables S3 and S4 ) . The morphology of the injured lesion with a diffuse margin was shown in the elastic modulus mapping . Following that , the spinal cord tissue in the injured region of both groups exhibited a gradual rise in flexibility in comparison with the unaffected area on the seventh day after the injury ( p < 0 . 001 ; Figures 7B and S2 ; Tables S3 and S4 ) . On the 14th day , there was still a notable disparity in the elastic modulus between the injured tissue JIN et al . 7 of 16 FIGURE 4 Effects of durotomy on macrophage accumulation after SCI .

Animals that underwent durotomy showed similar results in the ex vivo specimens and stiffness maps . Although there were visible faint red marks and beginning scar development in the lesion core and rim areas of the damaged tissue , the stiffness maps did not indicate a significant disparity ( p = 0 . 467 ; Figures 7C and S2 ; Table S4 ) . On day 28 , the measured elastic moduli of IR in the SCI + laminectomy group had increased , but tissue in AFIR remained stiffer than injured tissue ( p < 0 . 001 ; Figure 7D ; Figure S2 ; Table S3 ) . However , we observed no significant difference in tissue elastic stiffness between the IR and AFIR tissues in the SCI + durotomy group ( p = 0 . 734 ; Figures 7D and S2 ; Table S4 ) . As illustrated in Figure 7E , the elasticity evolution of the IR tissue displayed a nonlinear increasing trend in the two groups from day 3 to day 28 postinjury . Within the first week after SCI , days 3 and 7 were selected to observe and compare the extent of tissue elastic property recovery between the two groups ; the findings revealed 8 of 16 JIN et al .

Surprisingly , the spinal cord tissue recov - ered to basal levels more quickly over time in animals that had received durotomy treatment than in laminectomy - only animals . The statistical analysis indicated that the elastic moduli of injured spinal cord tissue in SCI + duro - tomy group recovered toward 9733 . 5 ± 816 . 2 Pa at day 14 postinjury , with no notable difference compared with that of the control animals ( p = 1 . 000 ; Figure 7F ) but signifi - cantly higher compared with that of the SCI + laminec - tomy group ( 9733 . 5 ± 816 . 2 vs . 7657 . 4 ± 1141 . 3 Pa , p < 0 . 001 ; Figure 7E ; Table S5 ) . Little change was observed in tissue elasticity in the SCI + durotomy group for the following 14 days . No significant disparity between the sham - controlled animals and durotomy - treated animals was found ( p = 0 . 933 ; Figure 7F ) . However , the tissue stiffness in the SCI + durotomy group remained stiffer than that of the laminectomy - only animals at day 28 post - SCI ( 9955 . 0 ± 1087 . 2 vs . 7889 . 8 ± 1039 . 2 Pa , p < 0 . 001 ; Figures 7E and F ; Table S5 ) .

Our experimen - tal data suggest that decompression with laminectomy , followed by durotomy , provides significant functional ben - efits . Furthermore , based on a comprehensive analysis of radiographic , histological , and mechanical data , we found that early surgical decompressing of the intradural space limited the development of local edema and cystic cavita - tion , attenuated secondary inflammatory infiltration , and fibrous scar formation and promoted rapid recovery of the elastic properties of injured tissue . Secondary SCI in animals and humans is commonly attributed to edema . 27 – 30 Vasogenic edema is characterized by the disruption of the blood - brain barrier , resulting in the escape of plasma fluid into the extracellular space . 31 Following SCI , the enlarged spinal cord might exert pres - sure on the dural components , leading to elevated cord pressure within the tissue ( due to the thicker and stiffer pial - glial zone in the spinal cord contrasted with the brain , the cord is more susceptible to pressure effects ) . 30 The animals that received early decompressive durotomy exhibited significant parenchymal edema , as the spinal cord partly ruptured via the durotomy site during decom - pression , which was visible to the naked eye . Further , the findings of percentage water content showed that SCI resulted in notable tissue swelling , which was particularly evident compared with the initial state for both groups dur - ing the initial 2 - week period following the injury . Despite the absence of a notable distinction on day 14 , the initial phases of SCI resulted in detrimental impacts on the recu - peration of behavior due to the severity of tissue damage and compression of interstitial edema . These effects can be detected through BBB evaluation and were more pro - nounced compared with the SCI + durotomy group . The results demonstrated that early intrathecal decompression may play a more significant role in preventing secondary injury caused by compression of a swollen spinal cord . Clip - compression damage to the spinal cord may lead to the infiltration of both acute and chronic inflammatory cells . The initiation of posttraumatic cystic cavitation has been demonstrated to occur when peripheral macrophages and resident microglia infiltrate and become activated after SCI . 32 In the present investigation , the occurrence of cys - tic cavitation was almost non - existent in instances where durotomy was employed , potentially due to a significant hindrance in the buildup of macrophages at the injury site . Extensive infiltration of macrophages occurred in the SCI + laminectomy group , potentially leading to the development of sizable cystic cavities at the site of injury . As far as we know , there has been no investigation into the alteration of the elastic rigidity of damaged cord tissue following durotomy . During the initial 14 days after the injury , we noticed a significant decrease in stiffness 10 of 16 JIN et al . FIGURE 7 Effects of durotomy on tissue elastic properties of spinal cord after SCI .

The stiffness reached its minimum on the 3rd day following the injury , potentially attributable to the development of tissue swelling at the location of the acute phase . This significant observation largely corroborated previous findings by Moeendarbary et al . , 33 who also documented a substantial decrease in the rigidity of rat spinal cord tissue roughly 1 . 5 weeks after the traumatic lesion . Our results also indicated that 14 days after the injury , the stiffness of the damaged tissue in animals that underwent early durotomy eventually approached levels similar to those of the uninjured tissue , which were higher than those in animals that underwent SCI plus laminectomy . Remarkably , on day 28 , the stiff - ness levels in the SCI + durotomy group exhibited no JIN et al . 11 of 16 statistically significant difference compared with the SCI and control groups and remained similar to the baseline values . These findings are captivating due to several factors . The mechanical features of the microenvironment can affect the behavior and characteristics of nearby cells . Stiffness , for instance , modifies the process of cell differentiation , 34 proliferation , 35 and migration . 36 – 38 The physical features of a substrate or tissue , such as its mechanical characteristics , can have an impact on the behavior of neurons . These qualities can affect many features , such as the rate at which neurites extend , 39 the direction of axonal outgrowth , 40 and the degree of branching in neurites . 41 Furthermore , on a larger scale , any excessive forces that occur at the interface of tissues can disturb the overall structure and impede the movement of cells or axons . Furthermore , the impact of injury on the mechanical properties of central nervous system ( CNS ) tissue may have substantial implications for neuronal regeneration despite the fact that a complete characterization of these effects is still lacking . 42 In the present study , the behavioral results showed a pronounced difference between the two groups from day 14 postinjury , suggesting that earlier recovery of injured tissue stiffness resulted in better recovery of motor function . The rats that had undergone dural decompression showed clear functional indications of neuroprotection . Thus far , there have been inconsistent reports about the impact of durotomy or duroplasty on functional outcomes . 24 – 26 , 43 Animal investigations have demon - strated the beneficial impact of durotomy and duroplasty . The research investigation carried out by Smith et al . 24 investigated the impact of performing a surgical procedure known as durotomy with duroplasty on the recuperation of rats with cervical SCI . The rats that underwent a dural incision and dural graft showed less inflammation , scar formation and cavitation compared with the group that just had a contusion . Additionally , they demonstrated enhanced functional recovery . Nevertheless , numerous research studies have documented adverse outcomes . According to Jalan et al . , 26 they carried out durotomy and duroplasty procedures in rats but found no enhancement in mobility . The analysis of the rats’ catwalk gait revealed a decrease in limb coordination . Furthermore , the dural transplant group exhibited greater lesions , heightened white matter , and additional compression following the placement of the graft . Camlar et al . 43 analyzed the effects of durotomy on neurological function . The groups did not show any significant differences in Tarlov test scores , and the results of duroplasty were not positive . Even though expansile duroplasty is a commonly performed clinical procedure involving an alloderm graft that is sewn in , its standardization in experimental SCI literature has not been established . Although technically possible , expansile duroplasty with primary dural closure is generally not car - ried out in rats . This article utilizes a fat pad as an epidural graft , similar to the dural closure procedure used in pitu - itary surgery . Prior studies with rodents have utilized fibrin sealants , allografts , or collagen matrices . Complications in rodent experiments have been associated with many occurrences of dural closures . For example , Jalan et al . 26 discovered that the utilization of readily accessible dural sealant can lead to substantial compression of the spinal cord in approximately 50 % of the animals . Hence , it is inad - visable to utilize these sealants for the purpose of healing dural lesions in a rodent model of SCI . Despite numerous studies highlighting the beneficial impacts of duroplasty on functional outcomes , there remains a prevailing per - ception of its potential risks , leading certain surgeons to opt against conducting such procedures . It is worth men - tioning that there is a lack of adequate clinical data , and it will be necessary to conduct a randomized controlled study in the future to ascertain the efficacy of durotomy . This study has several important limitations . First , the small number of experimental animals is not enough to avoid selection bias . Second , prior to the production of crush SCI , the SCI protocol necessitated decompressive laminectomy ; however , this does not accurately replicate a genuine clinical SCI scenario where a displaced spinal column could lead to initial injury and subsequent cord compression . Third , despite the extensive use of ex vivo measurement methods to gather most of the information regarding the mechanical properties of spinal cord tissue , this study has limitations due to the inability of ex vivo analyses to accurately reflect in vivo circumstances . 44 – 47 Variation in the viscoelastic characteristics of ex vivo tis - sues , as compared with in vivo tissues , may arise due to variations in cerebrospinal fluid pressure and tissue degradation . These disparities can occur even when the tis - sues are stored under ideal conditions for preservation . 48 , 49 Nevertheless , this should not impact the assessment of the relative behaviors of damaged and undamaged spinal tissues . In addition , this study did not investigate any par - ticular mechanism of durotomy . Further investigation is necessary to examine the underlying mechanisms that elu - cidate the impact of early decompressive physiology on apoptosis , blood flow , and inflammatory changes in the chronic entry phase . In summary , the findings suggested that prompt intrathecal decompression had a significant positive impact on the mobility of rats with thoracic SCI . More - over , performing surgical durotomy following crush SCI led to a significant and enduring hindrance in the infiltration of activated macrophages inside and around the injury site , which was linked to an almost complete reduction of posttraumatic cystic cavitation . In conclu - sion , our findings demonstrate that durotomy significantly 12 of 16 JIN et al . restricts the formation of fibrous scar tissue , as evidenced by a reduction in fibronectin deposition , and enhances the swift restoration of tissue elasticity . Performing an early surgical decompressive durotomy could potentially reduce secondary damage and establish a more favorable microenvironment for the potential transplantation of cells or biomaterials in the treatment of spinal cord injuries . 4 MATERIALS AND METHODS 4 . 1 Study design All experimental techniques were carried out in accor - dance with the United Kingdom Animals ( Scientific Proce - dures ) Act of 1986 . The animal experimentation techniques were authorized by the Animal Welfare Committee at Tongji Hospital , which is affiliated with Tongji Univer - sity in Shanghai , China . Figure 1 depicts the study’s design . This study involved the selection of 142 mature female Sprague – Dawley rats , aged 11 − 12 weeks and weigh - ing between 240 and 260 g . The rats were allocated into three groups through a random process : the sham control group ( N = 16 ) , which underwent only laminec - tomy ; the SCI + laminectomy group ( epidural decom - pression , N = 63 ) , which experienced clip - compression injury along with laminectomy alone ; and the SCI + duro - tomy group ( intrathecal decompression , N = 63 ) , which underwent clip - compression injury along with laminec - tomy and decompressive durotomy . Rats were evaluated by behavioral testing , bladder function analysis , tissue water content analysis , histology analysis , MRI measurements , and mechanical indentation testing at different time points postinjury . 4 . 2 Surgical procedure of rat SCI model Aseptic protocols were enforced for each surgical proce - dure . Anesthesia was initiated with the use of isoflurane ( 4 . 0 % oxygen ) and sustained at a concentration of 1 . 5 – 2 . 0 % in oxygen delivered via a facemask . A surgical cut was created along the middle line of the body to access the thoracic vertebrae , and then a procedure called T8 - T10 laminectomy was performed . In order to avoid harm to the adjacent nerve roots , an aneurysm clip ( 50 . 0 g ; Fine Sci - ence Tools , Heidelberg , Germany ) was passed extradurally anterior to the cord , while still in its open position . Due to the rapid discharge of the clip from the applicator , an acute dorsoventral impact - compression injury was established . The spinal cord was fully crushed at the T9 spinal - cord level for 30 s ( Figure 1A ) . Separate sham control animals were subjected to T8 – T10 laminectomy ; nevertheless , no sustained compressive injury was induced . Perform man - ual bladder expression twice daily until normal bladder function is restored . In this paper , the term “postinjury” will be employed to measure the amount of time that has passed for the procedures outlined above , including those performed on animals in the sham control group . 4 . 3 Surgical procedure of durotomy After 24 h of injury , the sutures were removed in order to reveal the location of the compressed injury . Rats in both the control and SCI + laminectomy groups underwent the same procedure of having their incisions restitched and closed , following which they were given postopera - tive bladder expression , as previously mentioned . Rats that were randomized and assigned to undergo a decompres - sive durotomy had their surgical sites exposed again . The dura was incised using a # 11 blade under high magnifi - cation , creating a durotomy with a diameter of around 5 . 0 mm . The dural opening was then gently expanded using two Dumond # 5 forceps . Careful evacuation was per - formed to examine the exposed intradural spinal cord and remove any remaining bleeding or blood clots . In order to decrease excessive adhesion , a small adipose tissue frag - ment was placed on the top of the spinal cord . The incisions were closed , and care was provided as described above . 4 . 4 Behavioural analysis The BBB open - field locomotor rating scale is a highly responsive assessment of hindlimb locomotor behavior , which is evaluated by an observer . 50 Ten rats randomly selected from each group were evaluated for blinded rat - ing by two well - trained observers on days 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , and 28 postinjury . 4 . 5 Bladder function analysis After thoracic SCI , manual bladder expression was nec - essary for all animals . For the purpose of maintaining records , each bladder expression was categorized based on its size , with observations varying from being empty to being of considerable size . Ten rats , randomly selected from each group , were evaluated for bladder function recovery . Urine from the first bladder expression of the day was collected and measured with a serological pipette on days 3 , 7 , and 14 postinjury . The average residual urine volumes were then calculated over a period of time to determine the recovery time of relative bladder function for each group in the experiment . JIN et al . 13 of 16 4 . 6 Water content analysis After the surgery , a combined number of 48 creatures ( SCI + laminectomy group [ N = 24 ] ; SCI + durotomy group [ N = 24 ] ) were put to sleep on the 3rd , 7th , and 14th days . A ∼ 20 . 0 mm long sample was obtained by cutting their spinal cords 10 . 0 mm toward the head and 10 . 0 mm toward the tail from the lesion site , after which it was isolated and removed . The cord segments were placed into Eppendorf tubes that had been preweighed and then weighed on an analytical scale to determine their wet weight . The sections of cord were placed in an oven at a temperature of 105 . 0 ◦ C for a duration of 24 h . After - ward , they were reweighed ( as dry weight ) to ascertain the amount of water that had evaporated . The water con - tent percentage was determined by applying the Elliot equation : Percent water content = wet weight − dry weight wet weight × 100 ( 1 ) 4 . 7 MRI experiment All MRI measurements were performed on a dedicated small bore animal 11 . 7 - T scanner ( Biospec 117 / 16 ; Bruker , Ettlingen , Germany ) ( Figure 1C ) . The detailed MRI param - eters were presented in the Supplementary Material ( Method S1 ) . 4 . 8 MRI analysis and statistics Figure 1D displays the measurement of lesion indicators on a sagittal T2 - weighted image . The lesion area refers to the proportion of the lesion region in the T8 – T10 spinal cord , whilst the lesion length and breadth reflect the largest longitudinal and transverse diameters of the lesion area , respectively . BASIC scoring was conducted based on the observations made on an axial T2 - weighted picture as depicted in Figure 1E . 51 , 52 4 . 9 Tissue processing , hematoxylin – eosin staining , and immunohistochemistry Coronal histological slices of the cord segments were prepared at a thickness of 4 . 0 mm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) to examine the tissue’s histological structure after the injury . To evaluate the presence of inflammatory infiltration and the formation of scars , immunohistochemistry was conducted . Following three washes in PBS , the sections were then blocked with normal goat serum for a dura - tion of 30 min and subsequently washed again using PBS . The sections were then left to incubate overnight with different primary antibodies : ( 1 ) rabbit anti - CD68 ( Servicebio ; GB113109 , 1 : 1000 ) for systemic macrophages , ( 2 ) rabbit anti - CD11b ( Servicebio ; GB11058 , 1 : 500 ) for macrophages / activated microglia , ( 3 ) rabbit anti - GFAP ( Servicebio ; GB11096 , 1 : 1000 ) for astrocytes , and ( 4 ) rab - bit antifibronectin ( Servicebio ; GB13091 , 1 : 100 ) for potent inhibitors of CNS regeneration . The primary antibodies were rinsed in PBS ( 3 × 5 min ) . Subsequently , the sections were exposed to goat anti - rabbit horseradish peroxidase ( Servicebio ; GB23303 , 1 : 500 ) , goat anti - rabbit Cy3 ( Service - bio ; GB21303 , 1 : 300 ) , and goat anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 ( Servicebio ; GB25303 , 1 : 400 ) secondary antibodies for a duration of 50 min . The slides were then treated with a solution of 4′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) at ambi - ent temperature ( ∼ 24 . 0 ◦ C ) for a duration of 10 min while being stored in a light - free environment . The sections were then rinsed with PBS ( 3 × 5 min ) , affixed using antifade mounting media , and secured with a coverslip . Fluores - cence microscopy was employed to photograph sagittal slices of the spinal cord . 4 . 10 Morphological quantification The quantification of CD68 stained regions was per - formed to evaluate the presence of inflammatory cells ( Method S4 ) . Immunofluorescence labelling with GFAP and fibronectin was used to assess the extent of scar for - mation at the site of injury ( Method S4 ) . Cavity areas were analyzed using serial sections stained with H & E ( Method S4 ) . 4 . 11 Indentation setup Figure 1F depicts a diagram illustrating the indentation experiments . The mechanical elastic characteristics of the tissue were quantified using a Mach - 1 Model V500css device ( Biomomentum Inc . , Laval , QC , Canada ) . The detailed device parameters were presented in the Supple - mentary Material ( Method S2 ) . 4 . 12 Tissue preparation and indentation measurements The spinal cord tissue was dissected and prepared using standard procedures before indentation testing , as previ - ously described ( Method S3 ) . 53 14 of 16 JIN et al . Indentation measurements were utilized to generate stiffness maps for the purpose of analyzing the spatial orga - nization of the elastic modulus of the spinal cord . A total of 54 rats were used in the studies , with 24 rats in the SCI + laminectomy group , 24 rats in the SCI + durotomy group , and six rats in the control group . The indenter was given a spherical tip with a diameter of 0 . 50 mm . Ani - mals with spinal crush injuries displayed inconsistent and dispersed borders , indicating different degrees of tissue injury . The Mach - 1 acquisition program was deployed to capture the force – displacement curves for every region of interest encompassed by a grid of indentation points . The indentation rate was 0 . 10 mm / s , and the measured depth was 0 . 25 mm . Sequential indentations were initi - ated at the front edge of the affected area ( ∼ 10 . 0 mm ) and progressed toward the tail , with a spacing of 0 . 5 mm between each indentation , until the undamaged portions of the specimen , confirmed by visual examination , were reached . Each specimen had an average of around 39 recorded measures ( Figure S3 ) . Significantly , in the assess - ment of a nonlinear specimen response using a spherical indenter tip , it is of utmost importance to consistently and accurately determine the interaction between the inden - ter tip and soft tissue , as it has been observed that visually estimating the contact conditions is not dependable or precise . 54 Therefore , a more organized method was cre - ated to avoid incorrect identification and consider minor changes in force ( Figure S4 ) . 4 . 13 Indentation data analysis The determination of the elastic modulus was accom - plished using the indentation technique and a spherical indenter , as illustrated in Figure 1G . As mentioned before , the Mach - 1 analysis software was employed to adapt the elastic model ( Hayes’s model ) for indentation to the force – displacement curve . 55 The elastic moduli at each place were determined , employing a Poisson’s ratio of 0 . 5 . The mean thickness of 3 . 0 mm ( with a range of 2 . 8 – 3 . 2 mm ) was determined using a digital caliper . 56 – 59 The mechanical characterization of the samples affixed to a level inflexible backing was highly appropriate for this framework ( at minimum 10 times more rigid than the sam - ple ) . The formula below was used to calculate the elastic modulus : Elastic modulus = 𝑃 𝐻 × 1 − 𝑣 2 2𝑎𝑘 ( 𝑎 ℎ , 𝑣 ) ( 2 ) The variables in the equation are as follows : 𝑃 represents the force applied , 𝐻 represents the displacement caused by indentation , 𝑣 represents Poisson’s ratio , 𝑎 represents the radius of the contact region , 𝑘 determined by the 𝑎 / ℎ and 𝑣 , and ℎ represents the thickness of the specimen . 4 . 14 Statistical analysis The data analysis was conducted using both SPSS and GraphPad Prism software . Utilizing a two - tailed Student’s t - test to assess the disparities between the two groups and employing the Shapiro – Wilk normality assessment test to determine the normality of the data correspondingly . The Mann – Whitney – Wilcoxon test was utilized to compare results that deviated from a normal distribution . When the variances were equal , multiple group comparisons were performed using a one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) together with Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis . The Kruskal – Wallis ANOVA with Games - post hoc analysis was used in all other scenarios . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , and * * * p < 0 . 001 . AU T H O R C O N T R I B U T I O N S C . J . , L .
