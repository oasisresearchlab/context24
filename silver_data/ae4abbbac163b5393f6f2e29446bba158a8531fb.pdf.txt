Despite the disease 15 relevance of PC2 , the physiological agonist that activates PC2 has remained elusive . As 16 one of the earliest symptoms in PKD is a urine concentrating deficiency , we hypothesized 17 that shifts in osmolarity experienced by the collecting duct cells would activate PC2 and 18 loss of PC2 would prevent osmosensing . We found that mice with inducible PC2 knocked 19 out ( KO ) in renal tubules had dilute urine . Hyperosmotic stimuli induced a rise in 20 endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) - mediated cytosolic calcium which was absent in PC2 KO 21 mice and PC2 KO cells . A pathologic point mutation that prevents ion flux through PC2 22 inhibited the calcium rise , pointing to the centrality of PC2 in the osmotic response . To 23 understand how an extracellular stimulus activated ER - localized PC2 , we examined 24 microtubule - ER dynamics , and found that the osmotically induced calcium increase was 25 preceded by microtubule destabilization . This was due to a novel interaction between 26 PC2 and the microtubule binding protein MAP4 that tethers the microtubules to the ER . 27 Finally , disruption of the MAP4 - PC2 interaction prevented incorporation of the water 28 channel aquaporin 2 following a hyperosmotic challenge , in part explaining the dilute 29 urine . Our results demonstrate that MAP4 - dependent microtubule stabilization of ER - 30 resident PC2 is required for PC2 to participate in the osmosensing pathway . Moreover , 31 osmolarity represents a bona fide physiological stimulus for ER - localized PC2 and loss 32 of PC2 in renal epithelial cells impairs osmosensing ability and urine concentrating 33 capacity . 34 35 36 2 Graphical Abstract : 37 38 39 40 Introduction 41 42 Mechano - transduction pathways couple extracellular cues , such as fluid flow and 43 stretch to a signaling response that enable a cell to adequately respond to changes in the 44 environment . These extracellular cues can be transmitted via ion channels on the plasma 45 membrane such as piezo or transient receptor potential ( TRP ) channels [ 1 , 2 ] . One such 46 environment where extracellular cues must be rapidly converted into intracellular signals 47 is the kidney , where urine is concentrated . The concentration of urine requires the 48 selective salt and water permeabilities of the renal epithelial cells within the tubule . The 49 active pumping of salts combined with the urea recycling help to generate the osmotic 50 gradient that can reach up to ~ 1 , 200 mOsm in the depth of the medulla in humans [ 3 ] . 51 However , the osmolarity of the tubular fluid ( i . e . urine ) flowing through the renal tubules 52 varies depending on a body’s demands . The final osmolarity of the urine as it exits the 53 collecting duct varies between ~ 50 to 1 , 200 mOsm [ 3 ] . Thus , medullary collecting duct 54 cells need to quickly adapt to changes in tubular fluid osmolarity to maintain the medullary 55 gradient . Disruption in the ability of the cell to adapt to these responses impair the kidney’s 56 ability to concentrate urine [ 4 ] . 57 58 A lack of urine concentrating ability is observed in many renal disorders including 59 Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ADPKD ) , the leading genetic cause of 60 renal failure which has no cure [ 5 ] . Although ADPKD is characterized by the formation of 61 renal cysts throughout the nephron , including in the collecting duct , impaired urine 62 concentration is an early symptom of the disease [ 6 ] . As urine flows , water is reabsorbed 63 in the collecting duct which is partially mediated by aquaporin 2 ( AQP2 ) which allows for 64 water flux into the cell across the apical membrane [ 3 , 7 ] . Expression and trafficking of 65 AQP2 is canonically activated by arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) [ 8 ] . AVP binds to the 66 vasopressin receptor type 2 ( V2R ) on the basolateral side of the membrane leading to 67 3 increased cAMP inducing translation and vesicular trafficking of AQP2 [ 8 ] . Despite the 68 physiological importance of urine concentration , the mechanosensitive signaling 69 pathways that allow for collecting duct epithelial cells to respond to changes in urine 70 osmolarity and how these pathways affect AQP2 insertion into the membrane in ADPKD 71 models is not fully understood . 72 73 Polycystin 2 ( PC2 ) is one of the two main genes which when mutated results in 74 ADPKD [ 9 ] . PC2 is a non - selective cation channel that belongs to the TRP polycystin 75 channel family and can reside on the primary cilia , plasma membrane and endoplasmic 76 reticulum ( ER ) [ 10 ] . In the ER , PC2 can mediate calcium release either directly or via 77 interactions with other calcium release channels [ 11 - 13 ] . Electrophysiological approaches 78 have demonstrated that PC2 can mediate flux of sodium , potassium , and calcium across 79 the ciliary or plasma membrane [ 14 - 18 ] . In primary cilia , PC2 , either by itself or in complex 80 with its interacting partner polycystin 1 ( PC1 ) , can act as a mechanosensitive channel 81 that opens in response to changes to fluid flow [ 19 ] . Recent work demonstrated that in 82 nodal cilia , PC2 is activated upon multiple bending of the cilia and is required for left - right 83 patterning [ 20 , 21 ] . However , a high number of ciliary bends are required to elicit the 84 calcium signal . As there is no consensus for the agonist for PC2 in renal epithelial cells , 85 it is unclear whether the bending experienced by the primary cilia under fluid flow of urine 86 is the true physiologic signal required to activate a calcium signal from the PC2 complex . 87 88 As the majority of PC2 resides in the ER , we examined the contribution of PC2 to 89 calcium signaling responses arising from the primary cilia , the plasma membrane , and 90 the ER upon osmotic changes . We hypothesized that shifts in extracellular tonicity would 91 act as a natural agonist for ER - localized PC2 in renal epithelial cells and that loss of PC2 , 92 as would be expected in the setting of ADPKD , would impair urine concentrating ability . 93 Compared to the control ( CTL ) mice , we found that deletion of PC2 in the tubules of pre - 94 cystic mice resulted in dilute urine . Hyperosmotic stimuli induced a calcium response in 95 isolated kidney tubules and in a variety of cell lines . This response was absent in kidney 96 tubules from pre - cystic PC2 KO mice and in cultured cell lines . Re - expression of full - 97 length PC2 but not a pathogenic variant , restored the cytosolic calcium response . The 98 calcium response was found to originate in the ER and not the primary cilia or plasma 99 membrane . Mechanistically , we identified a novel molecular mechanism by which the 100 osmotic stimuli activated PC2 calcium release . PC2 associated with the microtubule 101 binding protein MAP4 , which upon hyperosmotic stimuli , dissociated from the microtubule 102 allowing for PC2 calcium release . The biological necessity of the interaction between PC2 103 and MAP4 to transduce osmotic stimuli was shown as trafficking of the AQP2 was 104 abolished in the PC2 KO cells , which ultimately contributes to diminished urine 105 concentration . 106 107 Materials and methods 108 109 Animal model . Pkd2 floxed mice [ 22 ] ( gift from Dr . Stefan Somlo , Yale University ) were 110 crossed with TetO - Cre and Pax8 - rtTA mice ( Jackson laboratories strain # 006234 and 111 # 007176 ) to generate Pkd2 FF TetO - Cre - Pax8 mice and TetO - Cre - Pax8 control mice . 112 Some mice were further crossed with LSL - Salsa6f mice ( Jackson laboratories strain 113 4 # 031968 ) to generate mice that expressed gCaMP6F and tdTomato upon Cre induction . 114 At 6 weeks of age , mice were fed doxycycline chow ( 625 mg / kg ) for 7 days to induce Cre 115 expression . Male and female mice , 13 - 20 weeks of age ( 1 . 5 - 3 months post induction ) 116 were used in the subsequent experiments . All animal studies performed were done under 117 approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) protocols at Loyola 118 University Chicago . 119 120 Urine analysis , metabolic cages : Animals provided with ad lib water were moved to a 121 hydrophobic surface and urine collected in the morning within the first 3 min of the animal 122 being removed from the cage . Urine volumes were between 50 to 100 µ L . Urine was 123 measured with a vapor osmometer ( Wescor 5520 Vapor Pressure Osmometer ) . A subset 124 of animals had body measurements conducted by NMR spectroscopy followed by 125 metabolic cage analysis ( TSE Systems ) to measure energetic expenditure , food , and 126 water intake over 5 days . 127 128 Imaging of kidney sections . Animals were sedated with isoflurane and perfused with 129 saline via the left ventricle . The kidneys were rapidly excised and dissected into ~ 1mm 130 coronal sections in ice cold PBS and then transferred to kidney tubule solution ( mM : 120 131 NaCl ; 3 KCl ; 2 CaCl 2 ; 2 KH 2 PO 4 2 ; 5 Glucose ; 10 HEPES ; pH 7 . 3 ) . Sections were either 132 incubated in Fluo4 ( 5 µ M ) for 30 min at room temperature ( RT ) or incubated without Fluo4 - 133 AM in gCaMP expressing kidneys . Sections were washed 2 times with fresh kidney tubule 134 solution . Medullary tubules were identified by visual inspection based on anatomical 135 landmarks . Images were acquired by incubating the tubules at 250 mOsm ( 5 min ) 136 followed by 400 mOsm stimuli ( 10 min ) . To ensure distal and collecting duct tubules were 137 being assessed , only tubules that responded to exogenously applied vasopressin were 138 included in the analysis . Ionomycin was added at the completion of the experiment . 139 140 Cell culture and maintenance . Murine C2C12 myoblasts and Human Embryonic Kidney 141 ( HEK293T ) cells were purchased from ATCC . HEK293 cells that contain all the isoforms 142 of the InsP 3 R knocked out ( known as 3KO - HEK cells ) were a gift from Dr . David Yule 143 from the University of Rochester [ 23 ] . Immortalized murine collecting duct cells ( imCD3 ) 144 cells were a gift from Indra Chandrasekar from Sanford Health . C2C12 and HEK293T 145 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) while imCD3 cells 146 were cultured in F - 12 media . All media was supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine essence 147 ( FBE ) and antibiotics at 37°C and incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 and 148 95 % air . Cell cultures were kept to passages no higher than P12 . 149 150 Generation of PC2 and MAP - 4 CRISPR KO cell lines . We tested two different 151 CRISPR / Cas9 knockout All - In - One ZsGreen pClip lentivirus plasmids each containing a 152 separate guide sequence directed at different Pkd 2 and MAP4 loci , along with a control 153 template ( Transomic Technologies ) . The lentiviruses were made by co - transfecting 154 pRSV , pMDLg and pMD2 . G along with pClip into HEK293T cells . The supernatant 155 containing virus particles was harvested and used to transduce C2C12 , imCD3 , or 156 HEK293T cells . Following 48 hours of transduction , ZsGreen fluorescent C2C12 , imCD3 157 or HEK293T cells were sorted by flow cytometry and Pkd2 single cell clones expanded . 158 Selection of MAP4 from the mixed population was obtained by supplementing the media 159 5 with 10 µ M of blastocidin . Following expansion , the different cell lines were validated by 160 western blot , qPCR and immunofluorescent assay . 161 162 Measurement of intracellular calcium . We measured changes in calcium in the 163 following cellular compartments : cytosol , ER , plasma membrane and cilia . Calcium 164 measurements were measured using the following plasmids : gCAMP6F ( cytosolic 165 calcium ) , R - cepia ( ER calcium , gift of Dr . Aleskey Zima ) [ 24 ] , CAAX - gCaMP7s ( plasma 166 membrane , gift of Dr . Jordan Beach ) and Arl13B - gCaMP6F ( cilia , gift of Dr . Aldebaran 167 Hofer and made by the Yubin Zhao’s lab ) . Cells were plates on glass coverslips 48 hours 168 prior to imaging . Cells were transiently transfected 24 hours after plating with 2 µ g of the 169 DNA of interest and 25 µ L of PEI ( concentration 1 µ g / µ l stock ) diluted in OPTI - MEM and 170 incubated overnight . Regions of interest were drawn on individual cells to quantify calcium 171 measurements in at least 3 independent biological replicates . Cells were perfused with a 172 Warner gravity exchange fluid system ( Warner instruments ) for 2 min at 3ml / mn with 300 173 mOsm solution ( mM : 130 NaCl ; 2 CaCl 2 ; 1 MgCl ; 2 K 2 PO 4 2 ; 5 Glucose ; 10 HEPES ; 0 . 1 174 EGTA ; pH 7 . 3 ) prior to imaging . Cells were then perfused with the specified osmolarity . 175 Increase of osmolarity was done by increasing the concentration of NaCl or mannitol as 176 described in results . The osmolarity of solutions was measured by a vapor osmometer 177 ( Wescor 5520 Vapor Pressure Osmometer ) . gCaMP6F was excited with a 488nM LED 178 ( Lumnecor Spectra X Lamp ) and emitted fluorescence filtered with a band pass filter ( 515 - 179 530 , Chrom . Images were acquired with a sCMOS camera ( Orca Flash , Hamamatsu ) on 180 a wide - field fluorescence Zeiss microscope . Images were acquired at 15ms for a total of 181 3 - 6 minutes at RT . 182 183 Western blot analysis . Total protein extracts were collected after incubating cells under 184 the different osmotic conditions during 1 hour at 37 o C and prepared by lysing cells with 185 RIPA buffer ( in mM : 10 Tris - Cl , 1 EDTA , 0 . 5 EGTA , 1 % Triton - X , 0 . 1 % sodium 186 deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 140 NaCl ) containing protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - 187 Aldrich ) , and phosphatase inhibitors NaF and sodium orthovanadate ( Alfa Aesar ) . Protein 188 concentrations of the resulting supernatants were measured using the Pierce BCA 189 Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) . Equal amounts of protein ( 15 - 20 µ g ) were 190 separated by SDS - PAGE ( Bio - Rad , 4 - 20 % gradient gels ) and transferred to PVDF 191 membranes via wet transfer . Membranes were probed overnight with the following 192 primary antibodies : ⍺ - tubulin ( 1 : 1 , 000 , # 2125S ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , GAPDH 193 ( 1 : 1 , 500 , # 6004 - Ig ; ProteinTech ) , PC2 ( D - 3 , 1 : 500 , sc - 28331 ; Santa Cruz 194 Biotechnology ) , MAP4 ( 1 : 1000 ; # 11229 - 1 - AP ; ProteinTech ) , p - MAP4 ( 1 : 1000 , A51201 ; 195 antibodies . com ) , CLIMP63 ( CKAP4 , 1 : 1 , 200 , A302 - 257A ; Fortis Life Science ) , AQP2 196 ( 1 , 1000 , # 3487 ; CST ) . HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies were applied ( Immun - Star 197 Goat Anti - Mouse , 1 : 20 , 000 , 1705047 and Immun - Star Goat Anti - Rabbit , 1 : 20 , 000 , 198 1705046 , Biorad ) , and then activated with Clarity Max western ECL ( Bio - Rad ) . 199 Chemiluminescence was imaged with a ChemiDoc MP imager ( Bio - Rad ) ; signal intensity 200 of each protein was measured with ImageLab software ( Bio - Rad , v . 6 . 0 ) and normalized 201 to levels of ⍺ - tubulin or total protein ( Ponceau S ) . At least 3 - 5 biological replicates were 202 analyzed . 203 6 Immunofluorescence microscopy 204 Cells were grown on coverslips and cultured in media for 24 hours . Cells subjected to 205 osmotic stimulus were incubated in the specified osmotic buffer for 5 - 10 min and 206 immediately fixed . Cells were fixed in 2 % PFA for 20 min at room temperature , washed 207 three times in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and blocked for 45 min in 2 % BSA 208 blocking solution with 0 . 2 % triton X . The cells were incubated with antibodies against PC2 209 YCE2 ( 1 : 100 , sc - 47734 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , MAP4 ( 1 : 100 ; # SC - 390286 ; Santa 210 Cruz ) , CLIMP63 ( CKAP4 , 1 : 2 , 000 , A302 - 257A ; Fortis Life Science ) , AQP2 ( 1 , 1000 , 211 # 3487 ; CST ) , Arl13b ( 1 : 100 , # 17711 - 1 - AP ; ProteinTech ) overnight at 4°C , followed by 212 the appropriate secondary antibody ( Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 1000 , 213 A21202 , Invitrogen ) , Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 800 , A10040 , Invitrogen ) , 214 for 1 hr , then washed three times in PBS . Some slides were co - incubated with 647 - 215 phalloidin ( 1 : 1000 , 20555 , Cayman Chemicals ) during the secondary incubation step . 216 Coverslips were mounted with Prolong - Diamond mounting media with DAPI ( Invitrogen ) . 217 After curing , cells were imaged with a 43X oil ( N . A . 1 . 2 ) or 63X oil ( N . A . 1 . 4 ) objective on 218 an 880 Zeiss laser - scanning microscope with Airyscan ( Zeiss , Germany ) . Images were 219 post - processed with Zen Black software ( Zeiss , Germany ) and FIJI ( NIH ) [ 25 ] . 220 221 Live - cell imaging of microtubules and plus - end microtubules . Cells were plated on 222 glass coverslip 48 hours prior to imaging . Imaging of microtubules was performed by 223 staining the microtubules with ViaFluor Live Cell Microtubule Stain 647 ( Biotium ) following 224 the manufacturer’s protocol . Tracking of the plus - end side of the microtubules was 225 performed by transiently transfecting the cells with EB3 - tdTomato ( Addgene # 50708 ) 24 226 hours after plating following the protocol described in the previous section . Cells were 227 imaged with a 63x oil objective in an 880 Zeiss laser - scanning microscope with Airyscan . 228 Analysis of live - cell imaging . Calcium imaging movies were analyzed using FIJI and 229 the Time Series Analyzer V3 plugin . Quantification of the velocity , duration , and length of 230 EB3 - tdTomato comets was performed using the MtrackJ plugin in FIJI [ 26 ] . 231 232 Immunoprecipitation and Mass spectrometry . Protein ( 100 µ g ) isolated from the 233 kidney ( cortical and medullary ) and left ventricle of wild - type C57 Bl6 mice was incubated 234 with PC2 antibody ( 10 ug , Alomone laboratories ) overnight complexed to magnetic 235 protein G beads ( Biorad ) . Following 3 rounds of washing , the bound protein was eluted 236 and run , alongside flow - through on 4 - 12 % polyacrylamide gels . Silver stain ( Biorad ) was 237 used to identify bands for excision . Gel bands were excised and desiccated under hivac . 238 Gel fragments ( corresponding to 20 , 30 , 40 , 70 , 110 , 200 and 250 kDa ) were sent for LC - 239 MS / MS analysis using an LTQ Orbitrap Elite at Rosalind Franklin University ( Facility run 240 by Dr . Charlie Yang ) . In - gel tryptic digestion was followed by the identification of proteins 241 with the UniProt mouse database and PEAKS 8 . 5 software . Data were filtered based on 242 - 10 lgP , FDR , unique peptide , and de novo ALC % . As an internal control , six bovine 243 standard proteins were identified with high scores under the same conditions , to ensure 244 that LC - MS / MS was running well . 245 246 Statistical analysis . Data was plotted using GraphPad PRISM 9 . Data were tested for 247 normality using a normality and distribution test . For parametrically distributed data 248 7 comparing two independent groups student’s t - test was used . For nonparametric data , 249 Mann - Whitney analyses were conducted . Comparison of multiple groups with parametric 250 distribution were analyzed through One or Two - Way ANOVA followed Sidak’s multiple 251 comparison test . Comparison of multiple groups with non - parametric distribution were 252 analyzed through One or Two - Way ANOVA followed by Kruskal - Wallis test . Conditions 253 were considered statistically significant when p values were < 0 . 05 . For live imaging 254 experiments , quantifications were conducted using 10 - 20 cells per experimental condition 255 from 3 - 5 biological replicates . Error bars indicate Standard Error of the Mean ( SEM ) . 256 257 Results 258 259 Polycystin 2 tubule specific knock out mice have decreased urine osmolarity and impaired 260 calcium response to hyperosmotic stimuli 261 ADPKD patients have decreased ability to concentrate urine , however , it is unclear 262 if this defect is due to renal cysts or a signaling pathway impacted by the loss of functional 263 polycystin proteins [ 6 ] . At a stage when cyst burden was not high [ 22 ] , we analyzed 264 whether urine osmolarity ( i . e . urine concentration ) was impaired in adult mice with 265 induced PC2 kidney tubule - specific knock out ( PC2 KO ) versus the CTL ( Fig . 1A ) . Two 266 months after cre induction with doxycycline , the urine osmolarity of PC2 KO mice with ad 267 lib water access was significantly reduced compared to CTL mice ( Fig . 1B ) . Analysis of 268 drinking , food intake , bodily free fluid , and energy expenditure did not reveal any 269 differences between the CTL and PC2 KO mice ( Fig . S1A - D ) leading to the conclusion 270 that decreased urine osmolarity was not due to changes in water and food consumption 271 or the presence of renal cysts . 272 273 Extracellular osmolarity is known to induce increase of cytosolic calcium [ 27 , 28 ] 274 and deletion of PC2 impairs calcium signaling in renal cells [ 29 ] . However , it has not been 275 shown whether shifts in extracellular osmolarity stimulate PC2 - mediated calcium release . 276 To test if hyperosmotic shifts cause calcium release via a PC2 pathway , we tracked 277 changes to cytosolic calcium of kidney sections in Salsa mice or incubated with the 278 calcium sensor Fluo - 4AM . An extracellular osmolarity shift ( 250 mOsm to 400 mOsm ) in 279 renal tubules from CTL mice stimulated an increase of cytosolic calcium ( Fig . 1C - D , Video 280 1 ) . In contrast , tubules from the PC2 KO mice had no increase in intracellular calcium 281 after hyperosmotic stimuli ( Fig . 1C - D ) . Note that the tubules from the PC2 KO mice were 282 not cystic , and only showed mild dilation . Therefore , we consider these mice “pre - cystic” 283 [ 22 ] . Quantification of the area under the curve ( AUC ) was significantly decreased in the 284 tubules of the PC2 KO mice in comparison to the CTL ( Fig . 1E ) . We identified medullary 285 collecting duct tubules based on anatomical landmarks and ensured that these tubules 286 responded to exogenously applied vasopressin in both CTL and PC2 KO mice ( Fig . 1F ) . 287 288 Deletion of Polycystin 2 abolished calcium signaling to osmotic changes 289 To dissect the role of PC2 in the osmosensing pathway in renal epithelial cells , we 290 generated PC2 KO immortalized murine collecting duct cells ( imCD3 ) using the 291 CRISPR / Cas9 system . Validation of the PC2 deletion in the imCD3 cells was 292 demonstrated with western blot ( Fig . S2A - B ) and immunofluorescence assay ( Fig . S2C ) . 293 Then both CTL and PC2 KO imCD3 cells were transfected with the genetic calcium 294 8 reporter gCaMP6F to test whether PC2 was required for the cytosolic calcium signal after 295 hyperosmotic challenge . We perfused cells with isosmotic solution ( 300 mOsm ) for 3 296 minutes ( at 3ml / min ) to ensure there was no contribution of fluid flow or sheer stress . 297 Extracellular osmolarity was then increased to 400 mOsm in both cell lines and the flow 298 rate kept the same . In CTL cells , the hyperosmotic stimulus induced an increase of 299 cytosolic calcium , which was absent in the PC2 KO cells ( Fig . 2A , Video 2 ) . 300 Representative tracings of cytosolic calcium changes in both CTL and PC2 KO cells are 301 shown in Fig . 2B and Video 2 . Quantification of area under the curve and peak cytosolic 302 calcium were significantly decreased in the PC2 KO cells ( Fig . 2C - D ) . 303 304 To demonstrate that the hyperosmotically induced cytosolic calcium increase was 305 indeed mediated by PC2 , and were reproducible in another cell line , we performed the 306 same experiment in C2C12 myoblast cells , with PC2 knocked out [ 30 ] . We observed that 307 like the renal tubules and the imCD3 cells , the C2C12 CTL cells had increased cytosolic 308 calcium in response to extracellular osmotic changes ( Fig . 2E , black line ) whereas the 309 response was absent in the C2C12 PC2 KO cells ( Fig . 2E - G ) . To test that the cytosolic 310 calcium increase was due to the osmotic pressure and not the salt gradient , we increased 311 extracellular osmolarity with mannitol . This increase of extracellular osmolarity through 312 mannitol still elicited a cytosolic calcium response in the C2C12 CTL cells which was 313 absent in the PC2 KO cells ( Fig . S3A - B ) . Thus , we found that the cytosolic calcium 314 increase induced by hyperosmotic changes in the different tissues and cell lines analyzed 315 was absent where PC2 was deleted ( i . e . isolated kidney tubules , imCD3 and C2C12 316 myoblast cells ) . These results suggest that the calcium signaling induced by 317 hyperosmotic changes is mediated by PC2 . As the observed response was similar in the 318 tubules and two cell lines analyzed , we continued to dissect the osmosensing mechanism 319 in C2C12 cells to determine how ER localized PC2 senses extracellular changes . 320 321 The osmotically induced calcium signal does not originate from the plasma membrane or 322 cilia . 323 PC2 has been reported to localize to the primary cilia , plasma membrane and the 324 ER in different tissues [ 10 ] . To determine which localization the osmotically induced 325 calcium signal originated from , we first conducted experiments in the absence of 326 extracellular calcium . Even in the absence of extracellular calcium , an increase of 327 extracellular osmolarity still elicited a calcium response in CTL cells which was absent in 328 the C2C12 PC2 KO cells ( Fig . S3C - D ) . These results suggest that the calcium response 329 due to osmotic changes comes from intracellular calcium release and not calcium entry . 330 We then dissected the kinetics of the calcium responses in different cellular 331 compartments where PC2 is known to reside , namely the ER , the plasma membrane , 332 and the primary cilia using a variety of genetically encoded calcium indicators ( Fig . 3A ) . 333 We co - expressed R - cepia ( ER calcium indicator ) and gcamp7s - CAAX ( a plasma 334 membrane calcium indicator ) to simultaneously measure changes in the ER and plasma 335 membrane . Hyperosmotic stimulus first induced a reduction in ER calcium ( R - cepia ) 336 indicating calcium release from the ER ( Fig . 3B - C , region “a” ) , subsequently followed by 337 an increase in plasma membrane calcium ( Fig . 3B - C , region ‘b” ) . This observation 338 suggests that hyperosmotic changes induced ER calcium release which subsequently 339 stimulated calcium influx . Consistent with the previous finding , in the presence of 340 9 extracellular calcium , CTL cells elicited plasma membrane calcium sparks which were 341 absent in the C2C12 PC2 KO cells ( Fig . 3D ) . The lack of plasma membrane calcium 342 sparks in the C2C12 PC2 KO cells is interpreted to be due to the inability to activate 343 calcium activated calcium influx upon hyperosmotic changes . 344 345 A substantial amount of previous work has demonstrated that PC2 localizes to 346 primary cilia , where it can participate in calcium influx [ 14 - 16 , 18 ] . We therefore asked 347 whether osmotic changes were inducing a ciliary response amplified by the cytosolic 348 response . Using an Arl13B antibody we quantified the percentage of cells with cilia and 349 found that there was no significant difference between C2C12 CTL and PC2 KO cells 350 ( Fig . S4A - B ) . We then used a ciliary calcium indicator , gCaMP6f - Arl13B , and found that 351 osmotic stimuli did not stimulate ciliary calcium response ( Fig . 3E and Fig . S4C ) . We 352 ensured that the ciliary sensor is functional by applying ionomycin after the hyperosmotic 353 stimuli and observed robust ciliary calcium increases ( Fig . 3E ) . Taken together , we 354 demonstrated that hyperosmotic stimuli induced ER - localized PC2 calcium release which 355 further activates calcium influx from the plasma membrane to maintain the cytosolic 356 calcium response . These experimental results strongly suggest that neither ciliary PC2 357 nor plasma membrane localized PC2 contributes to the initial osmotically driven calcium 358 response . 359 360 Expression of the PC2 channel dead mutant acts as dominant negative in control cells 361 To validate that the initial calcium response is mediated by PC2 , we over - 362 expressed full length PC2 and a pathogenic variant ( D511V ) that does not allow ion flux 363 through PC2 . Expression of the PC2 - D511V variant in the CTL cells abolished the calcium 364 response , demonstrating that the mutation acted as a dominant negative ( Fig . 3F , blue 365 line ) . Expression of PC2 - D511V in the PC2 - KO cells did not restore the calcium response 366 upon hyperosmotic stimuli ( Fig . 3F , orange line ) . Importantly , over - expression of the full 367 length PC2 restored the calcium response ( Fig . 3G ) . Quantification of the AUC is shown 368 in Figure 3G for each of the conditions ( summary of response shown in Fig . 3H ) . These 369 data suggest that the osmotically induced calcium response requires not only the 370 expression of PC2 , but also a functional ion conducting PC2 to activate calcium release . 371 372 Polycystin 2 recruits InsP 3 R to sustain increase of cytosolic calcium due to osmotic stimuli 373 Although the previous experiments suggested that the calcium signal originated 374 from ER - localized PC2 , it seemed unlikely that PC2 was acting by itself to sustain the 375 calcium release . Previous work has demonstrated that PC2 can regulate the activity of 376 other ER - localized calcium channels like the InsP 3 R [ 11 - 13 ] . To determine if the lack of 377 observed calcium response was due to the absence of an interaction between PC2 and 378 InsP 3 R , we used a cell line , with the three isoforms of the InsP 3 R knocked out ( hereby 379 called 3KO - HEK generated from Human Embryonic Kidney ( HEK ) cells ) [ 23 ] . We 380 compared the HEK cells with PC2 KO we generated via CRISPR / Cas9 and validated 381 through western blot and quantitative real - time PCR ( RT - PCR ) ( Fig . S5A - C ) . After 382 increasing extracellular osmolarity , we observed a reduced cytosolic calcium increase in 383 the 3KO - HEK cells ( Fig . 3I - J ) . Quantification of the AUC in the 3KO - HEK cells showed 384 there was ~ 50 % less compared with the HEK CTL cells ( Fig . 3J ) . Moreover , the 385 osmotically induced response in the HEK CTL cells was composed of two different types 386 10 of calcium peaks : a sharp and fast response ( green line in Fig . 3K ) and a sustained 387 cytosolic calcium response ( black line in Fig . 3K ) . However , only the sharp and fast 388 response ( green line ) was observed in the 3KO - HEK cells . These data suggest that the 389 osmotic stimuli induce an initial calcium release mediated by ER - localized PC2 then 390 further recruited calcium channels , like the InsP 3 R , to sustain the cytosolic calcium 391 response ( Fig . 3K ) . 392 393 Microtubules aid in mediation of the osmosensing response 394 The data presented indicates that ER - localized PC2 initiates the calcium increase 395 in response to changes in extracellular osmolarity . These data raise the question , how is 396 an external osmotic stimulus being transmitted to the ER ? Osmolarity induces volumetric 397 changes that are mediated by rapid changes to the cytoskeleton [ 31 ] . Microtubules 398 directly link the cytoskeleton to the ER [ 32 ] . To determine if the microtubules mediate the 399 osmotic response , we tested the effects of the microtubule inhibitors paclitaxel ( Taxol ) 400 and nocodazole on the osmotic response ( Fig . 4A ) . Taxol stabilizes microtubules , 401 preventing depolymerization [ 33 ] , whereas nocodazole induces depolymerization of the 402 microtubules , causing destabilization and collapse of the microtubules [ 34 ] . We incubated 403 the cells with the microtubule inhibitors in isosmotic solution ( 300 mOsm ) and increased 404 extracellular osmolarity with the inhibitors . Application of the isosmotic solution with 405 nocodazole ( 5 µ M ) induced an initial calcium increase ( Fig . 4B , turquoise line ) , which we 406 interpret as the ER - localized PC2 calcium release upon depolymerization of the 407 microtubules . However , upon increase of extracellular osmolarity , there was no rise in the 408 cytosolic calcium in the presence of either nocodazole or Taxol ( Fig . 4B , D ) . The absence 409 of the cytosolic calcium response was due to prevention of the microtubules to relay the 410 extracellular changes ; this was confirmed as the addition of thapsigargin ( inhibitor of the 411 sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase ( SERCA ) which allows leakage of the ER 412 into the cytosol ) in the presence of hyperosmotic stimuli induced calcium release ( Fig . 413 4C ) . These data suggest that the ability to release intracellular calcium after hyperosmotic 414 stimuli is coupled to the integrity of the microtubules . 415 416 To assess the integrity of microtubules and determine if hyperosmolarity caused 417 depolymerization of the microtubules , we stained the microtubules with ViaFluor 647 . At 418 baseline conditions ( 300 mOsm ) , we observed that the structure of the microtubules was 419 different in C2C12 CTL versus PC2 KO cells ( Fig . 4E ) . Microtubules in the CTL cells were 420 linear and stretched across the whole cell whereas in the PC2 KO cells , microtubules 421 were dispersed and disorganized ( Fig . 4E , first panel of CTL and PC2 KO cells ) . The 422 degree of dispersion of the microtubules throughout the cells was significantly increased 423 in the PC2 KO cells ( Fig . 4F ) . A higher degree of dispersion is interpreted as less 424 directional and more dispersed distribution from the microtubules throughout the cell . 425 Increase in extracellular osmolarity caused retraction of the microtubules in the CTL cells 426 ( Fig . 4E , inset top panels ) . However , in the PC2 KO cells microtubules remained stable 427 after hyperosmotic change ( Fig . 4E , inset bottom panel ) . 428 429 We then examined microtubule growth dynamics by expressing EB3 - tdTomato 430 which binds to the plus - end of microtubules ( Fig . 4G , Video 3 ) . In CTL cells , the length of 431 EB3 comets in isosmotic conditions was approximately 3 µm ( Fig . 4H , black bars in CTL 432 11 cells ) . In CTL cells under hyperosmotic stimulus , the length of the EB3 comets was 433 decreased to ~ 1 . 5 µm ( Fig . 4H , blue bars in CTL cells ) . In PC2 KO cells , EB3 length 434 under isosmotic conditions was significantly shorter ( ~ 1 . 5 µm ) and remained the same 435 length under hyperosmotic conditions ( Fig 4H ) . Additionally , the velocity of the EB3 436 comets under hyperosmotic conditions in CTL cells was significantly increased , indicating 437 microtubule growth ( Fig . 4I ) . In contrast , the mean velocity of EB3 comets was 438 significantly increased at 300 mOsm but decreased upon hyperosmotic conditions in PC2 439 KO cells ( Fig . 4I ) . EB3 comet dynamics for C2C12 CTL and PC2 KO cells before and 440 after hyperosmotic changes are described in Table 1 . 441 442 To dissect the coupling of the microtubule rearrangement to the calcium signal 443 induced by hyperosmolarity , we co - expressed gCaMP6F and EB3 - tdTomato , to 444 simultaneously measure cytosolic calcium increase and microtubule dynamics ( Fig . 4J ) . 445 Following the hyperosmotic change , the length of the EB3 comets quickly decreased to 446 ~ 1 . 5 µm ( Fig . 4F ) . The decreased length of the EB3 comets was taken to indicate 447 microtubule collapse , which was then followed by an increase of cytosolic calcium ( Fig . 448 4F , red dots vs green line ) . These data strongly suggest that hyperosmolarity first induces 449 microtubule depolymerization , which then leads to intracellular calcium release from ER 450 localized PC2 . The absence of calcium signals from PC2 KO cells is likely due to the 451 combined effect of impaired microtubules organization and dynamics leading an inability 452 to relay external stimuli to intracellular signals like calcium release . 453 454 PC2 interacts with microtubule components 455 To identify how PC2 interacts with microtubules in the osmosensitive pathway , we 456 performed immunoprecipitation assays and mass spectrometry with PC2 from kidney 457 tissue . The identified list of proteins included new potential interactors such as 458 Microtubule Associated Protein ( MAP ) 4 ( Supp . Table 1 ) . We focused on MAP4 as it is 459 known to bind to microtubules to promote stabilization [ 35 ] . We validated the reciprocal 460 interaction between PC2 and MAP4 by immunoprecipitation in C2C12 myoblast cells ( Fig . 461 S6A ) . Staining of PC2 and MAP4 in C2C12 CTL cells showed partial colocalization of 462 these proteins ( Fig . S6B ) . We also stained CTL cells and PC2 KO cells to determine the 463 distribution of MAP4 in the cells . We observed that in PC2 KO cells , distribution of MAP4 464 appears evenly distributed throughout the cell in comparison to the CTL cells ( Fig . S6C ) . 465 Localization of MAP4 in the CTL cells closely resembled the distribution of the ER , labeled 466 with CLIMP63 ( Fig . S6D ) . 467 468 Deletion of PC2 affects ER morphology 469 Association of the microtubules with organelles [ 36 ] , including the ER , leads to 470 coordinated movement of MTs and ER [ 36 ] . The association formed by the MT - ER can 471 also dictate and regulate ER morphology [ 32 ] . As such , we explored whether the 472 disruption of the PC2 - MAP4 interaction affected ER morphology . In comparison to the 473 CTL cells , the PC2 KO cells had a higher ratio of cisternae to tubules ( Fig . S7A - B ) . Higher 474 cisternae ratio indicates a less motile and less dynamic ER . We examined CLIMP63 475 expression to visualize the ER in fixed cells ( Fig . S7C ) . In CTL cells , the ER was spread 476 throughout the cells , whereas the ER was confined to the nuclear area in PC2 KO cells . 477 Additionally , CLIMP63 particle size was significantly lower in PC2 KO cells , suggesting 478 12 that the ER covered less surface area than in the CTL cells . ( Fig . S7D ) . Re - expression of 479 full - length PC2 in the C2C12 PC2 KO cells restored the tubular conformation in the ER 480 ( Fig . S7E ) . 481 482 Deletion of PC2 collapsed and confines the ER to the nuclear area , therefore we 483 quantified the area between the plasma membrane and the ER . We transfected ER - 484 mCherry along with a gCaMP7s - CAAX membrane marker and observed that in PC2 KO , 485 the space between the ER membrane and plasma membrane was significantly increased 486 ( Fig . S7F - G ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that disruption of the tethering of 487 the ER and the microtubules is mediated by PC2 and MAP4 , and that this interaction not 488 only regulates ER morphology but as shown in Fig . 3 , microtubule dynamics . Moreover , 489 the increased spacing between the ER and plasma membrane in PC2 KO cells means 490 that under external stimulus PC2 contributes to more dynamic intracellular movement and 491 adaptation by altering ER morphology . 492 493 PC2 affects expression and phosphorylation of MAP4 494 Next , we aimed to ask how do PC2 and MAP4 mechanistically interact upon 495 hyperosmotic stimuli . It has been shown that binding of MAP4 to microtubules promotes 496 stabilization , and upon phosphorylation , MAP4 disassociates from the microtubules , 497 which destabilizes and promotes depolymerization of the microtubules [ 37 ] . Consistent 498 with the literature , we found that phosphorylation of MAP4 to total protein was significantly 499 increased upon hyperosmotic change in CTL cells ( Fig . 5A - B ) . In PC2 KO cells , 500 phosphorylated MAP4 , was increased in isosmotic conditions and remained unchanged 501 after hyperosmotic change ( Fig . 5A - B ) . After hyperosmotic stimuli , we observed that total 502 MAP4 remained unchanged in CTL cells after 1 hour ( Fig . 5C - D ) . In contrast , deletion of 503 PC2 significantly decreased expression of total MAP4 , to ~ 50 % less and remained 504 unchanged upon hyperosmotic stimulus ( Fig . 5C - D ) . To demonstrate that these changes 505 were specific to the MAP4 pathway , we measured the expression of another protein which 506 binds to microtubules and localizes to the ER , CLIMP63 . Expression of CLIMP63 507 remained unchanged upon increase of extracellular osmolarity or deletion of PC2 ( Fig . 508 5F ) . 509 510 To determine if the decreased expression of MAP4 was dependent on the calcium 511 activity of PC2 or the interaction with PC2 , we overexpressed WT PC2 and the calcium 512 dead channel variant ( D511V ) in the PC2 KO cells . Under hyperosmotic stimulation , 513 increase expression of MAP4 was restored in the presence of either the full - length PC2 514 or the D511 variant ( Fig . S8A ) . These results suggest that upon increase of extracellular 515 osmolarity MAP4 is phosphorylated and disassociates from the microtubules , leading to 516 unstable microtubules . Depolymerization of the microtubules then “tugs” on PC2 allowing 517 for PC2 mediated calcium release . Deletion of PC2 disrupts the connection between the 518 microtubules and the ER through its association with MAP4 , which further decreases the 519 expression of MAP4 . 520 521 Deletion of MAP4 phenocopies PC2 KO cells 522 We then confirmed that an interaction between PC2 and MAP4 is critical in 523 allowing the cell to mediate osmotic responses . Using CRISPR / Cas9 , we transfected 524 13 C2C12 cells with MAP4 specific guide RNA to generate a polyclonal knockout of MAP4 . 525 We validated that MAP4 expression was decreased 75 % through western blot ( Fig . 6A - 526 B ) and by immunofluorescence assay ( Fig . 6C ) . Expression of PC2 in the MAP4 - KO was 527 significantly increased ( Fig . S9A - B ) but the localization of PC2 remained unchanged in 528 the MAP4 - KO cells ( Fig . S9C ) . We examined CLIMP63 expression to determine if the 529 MAP4 - KO affected the distribution of the ER ( Fig . S9C ) . In CTL cells , CLIMP63 was 530 evenly distributed throughout the cell and co - localized with MAP4 ( Fig . 6C ) . However , in 531 the MAP4 - KO cells we observed that the ER remained closer to the nuclear area , like the 532 phenotype observed in the PC2 KO cells ( Fig . 6C ; Fig . S7C ) . Then , using the gCaMP6F , 533 we monitored changes to the cytosolic calcium upon increase of extracellular osmolarity 534 and found that deletion of MAP4 abolished the cytosolic calcium increase ( Fig . 6D ) . AUC 535 was significantly reduced in the MAP4 - KO cells compared to CTL cells ( Fig . 6E ) . Addition 536 of thapsigargin increased cytosolic calcium in the MAP4 - KO , indicating the cells were 537 able to respond to calcium agonists ( Fig . 6F ) . Earlier data suggested the deletion of PC2 538 affected the microtubules dynamics ; we examined if MAP4 - KO has a similar effect by 539 measuring the length of EB3 comets at baseline and after hyperosmotic stimuli ( Fig . 6G ) . 540 In comparison to the CTL cells , the length of EB3 comets was significantly shorter in the 541 MAP4 - KO ( Fig . 6H ) . Taken together , deletion of MAP4 phenocopied the PC2 KO cells in 542 the osmotically induced response . These results further validate that the association of 543 MAP4 and PC2 are responsible for the osmosensing pathway . 544 545 Biological implications of the PC2 - MAP4 osmosensing pathway 546 Earlier in this study , we showed that the urine osmolarity in the kidney tubule 547 specific PC2 KO mice were significantly decreased compared to the CTL mice ( Fig . 1B ) . 548 Urine concentration , in part , depends on the uptake of water through AQP2 . Trafficking 549 and regulation of AQP2 into the membrane occurs through the activation of the 550 vasopressin receptor or hyperosmotic increase [ 38 ] . Upon activation , vesicles travel 551 through the microtubules and are inserted in the apical membrane [ 39 ] . So far , we have 552 shown that deletion of PC2 disrupts the tethering of the microtubule to the ER and impairs 553 microtubules dynamics ( Fig . 4 ) . To determine the physiological effect of the PC2 - MAP4 554 osmosensing pathways , we examined AQP2 distribution after hyperosmotic challenge . 555 At baseline in CTL cells , AQP2 resided in the cytosol with minimal labeling in the 556 membrane ( Fig . 7A , 0 min ) . After stimulating the cells for 10 min with hyperosmotic 557 solution , AQP2 puncta moved to the apical membrane ( Fig . 7A , 10 min ) . Additionally , 558 hyperosmotic stimuli caused MAP4 co - localization with AQP2 in the membrane of CTL 559 cells . In contrast , there was minimal labeling of AQP2 and MAP4 in the membrane of PC2 560 KO cells , and this was unchanged during the hyperosmotic challenge ( Fig . 7B ) . Increase 561 of extracellular osmolarity significantly increased AQP2 cytosolic vesicle size in imCD3 562 CTL cells 10 min after exposure ( Fig . 7C ) . In contrast , AQP2 cytosolic vesicles were 563 already increased at baseline in imCD3 PC2 KO cells and remained unchanged after 564 osmotic stimuli ( Fig . 7C ) . As a control , we stimulated the cells with AVP ( 100nM ) to 565 activate the canonical pathway of AQP2 trafficking into the membrane . In CTL cells , both 566 AQP2 and MAP4 co - labeled in the membrane after 10 min with AVP ( Fig . 7D ) . 567 Interestingly , in PC2 KO cells , half of the cells showed labeling of AQP2 in the membrane , 568 but not of MAP4 ( Fig . 7D ) . We confirmed these results by examining the localization of 569 AQP2 in the collecting ducts of CTL and PC2 KO mice ( Fig . 7E - F ) . Labeling of AQP2 and 570 14 MAP4 in CTL mice localized in the membrane ( Fig . 7E ) . In comparison , to the tubule PC2 571 KO mice , there was diffuse cytosolic staining of AQP2 and MAP4 ( Fig . 7F ) . In conclusion , 572 we observed that the tethering of the cytoskeleton and the ER mediated by PC2 and 573 MAP4 have biological relevance as the disruption of these interactions impaired the 574 trafficking of AQP2 channel into the membrane , therefore impacting the ability to 575 concentrate urine . 576 577 Discussion 578 579 The physiological function of the polycystin TRP channel , PC2 , has been 580 contentious . Although the clinical importance of PC2 is well established , as mutations to 581 PC2 result in the genetic disorder ADPKD , the functional role and the identification of a 582 specific agonist that activates PC2 has been unclear . Many studies have established that 583 PC2 localizes to primary cilium where it appears to mediate ciliary signaling by itself or in 584 complexes with PC1 or with other TRP channels like TRPM3 [ 10 , 17 ] . However , whether 585 ciliary PC2 conducts calcium under physiological conditions has been debated . More 586 importantly , a bigger question that remains unanswered is the conditions that lead to the 587 activation of PC2 channel activity , either in the cilia , or the ER , where its role remains 588 poorly understood . Our study provides a model that provides answers to both questions : 589 what is a physiological stimulus that activates PC2 , and what is the role of PC2 within the 590 ER . We demonstrate that hyperosmotic shifts activate calcium release through PC2 591 channels in the ER by a novel mechano - transduction pathway that links the microtubules 592 to the ER through the interaction of PC2 and MAP4 . Our data demonstrates that 593 hyperosmotic stimuli induce microtubule depolymerization which in turn “tugs” on PC2 594 allowing for calcium release [ 40 ] . The initial calcium release by PC2 recruits other ER 595 localized calcium channels , most likely the InsP 3 R , which sustain the cytosolic calcium 596 response . Functionally , this osmosensing pathway allows for the insertion of AQP2 in the 597 membrane of collecting duct cells in an AVP - independent manner , which is of high 598 physiologic relevance as pre - cystic PC2 KO mice , like humans with ADPKD , have 599 decreased urine concentrating ability . 600 601 PC2 and its partner protein PC1 have been described as mechanosensory 602 proteins , in part due to its localization in the primary cilia [ 19 ] , which can bend in response 603 to changes in fluid flow or sheer stress . It has been thought that this bending can open 604 the PC2 channel , or the PC1 / PC2 complex in cilia , and presumably flux calcium , but as 605 a non - selective ion channel , it is possible that monovalent ions like sodium can be 606 conducted . Although electrophysiological approaches have tried to discern the ionic 607 preference of PC2 in the primary cilia , the conditions required to activate PC2 do not 608 resemble physiological conditions that the cell will experience [ 14 - 16 , 18 ] . Therefore , the 609 activation of the channel activity of PC2 to determine its ionic preference , although 610 important , has become disconnected from the physiological conditions that could 611 potentially activate PC2 and provide insight into the physiological roles these proteins 612 play in renal cells . We therefore chose to use a mild hyperosmotic stimulus ( 400 mOsm ) , 613 which represents a condition that normal collecting duct epithelial cells would be expected 614 to experience . Surprisingly , although the collecting duct can experience a wide range in 615 osmolarities ( between 50 - 1200 mOsm ) , there have been no comprehensive studies as to 616 15 whether polycystin proteins are activated by osmotic shifts . Although prior literature has 617 demonstrated that osmotic shifts within renal epithelial cells cause a rise in intracellular 618 calcium , this has not been connected to the polycystin proteins [ 41 ] . We show that 619 isolated kidney sections and renal epithelial cells ( and a variety of different cell lines ) with 620 PC2 deletions , were unable to increase their cytosolic calcium in response to extracellular 621 osmotic shifts . Importantly , for the wider discussion on the function of PC2 in the cilia , we 622 found that hyperosmotic stimuli by itself was incapable of eliciting a ciliary calcium 623 increase ( Fig . 3 ) . Moreover , the increase of cytosolic calcium that we did see by the 624 hyperosmotic stimuli does not back - propagate to the cilia ( which has been a scenario 625 proposed by other investigators ) . The very tight regulation of the calcium response to 626 hyperosmotic shifts highlights the distinction of ER - localized PC2 versus ciliary - localized 627 PC2 . It is possible that ciliary PC2 is required to sense other environmental cues such as 628 changing fluid flow , where repeated bending of the cilia might allow for calcium influx 629 through PC2 [ 20 , 21 ] . Thus , our proposed model is in harmony with the ciliary hypothesis 630 as it appears that the two localizations of PC2 - on the cilia , and on the ER - can 631 discriminate between the extracellular cues that the cells are experiencing ( Fig 8 ) . 632 Therefore , PC2 in the ER can respond to changes of osmolarity , whereas PC2 in the cilia 633 can be activated by multiple bending of the cilia . This would be congruent with previous 634 data where 30 bends are required to induce a nodal ciliary calcium response via PC2 [ 20 , 635 21 ] . However , we cannot discount the fact that osmotic changes can activate signaling 636 pathways within the cilia that are calcium independent , like Wnt , Notch and Hedgehog 637 signaling [ 42 ] . Therefore , the fact that ciliary calcium does not increase upon osmotic 638 changes , does not necessarily indicate that other signaling pathways are being activated . 639 Future studies would require the combination of both fluid flow and osmotic changes to 640 determine whether PC2 in the cilia acts as a coincident detector of osmolarity and fluid 641 flow . 642 643 Another question that arises from our findings is the role of TRP channels that are 644 activated by osmolarity and are present in renal cells . Hypoosmotic stimulus has been 645 shown to lead to calcium influx through both TRPC3 and TRPV4 [ 41 , 43 , 44 ] . It is possible 646 that hypoosmotic stimuli ( which presumably would have a very different mechanistic 647 pathway of activation than the hyperosmotic stimuli tested here ) could elicit activation of 648 a different set of TRP channels . However , recent work proposed that hyperosmotic 649 changes can also lead to the activation of calcium influx via TRPV4 [ 43 ] . Nonetheless , 650 the activation of calcium influx via hyperosmotic stimuli was not comparable to the calcium 651 influx activated by TRPV4 specific agonists [ 43 ] . More importantly , the authors suggested 652 that the cytosolic calcium increase induced by hyperosmolarity can be due to other 653 calcium channels . As PC2 has been shown to heterodimerize with TRPV4 [ 45 ] it is 654 possible that the requirement for TRPV4 in hyperosmotic stimuli also necessitates PC2 . 655 656 Our results also reveal a novel mechanosensation pathway whereby the 657 hyperosmotic stimuli reduce tension on the microtubules . Prior studies in the literature 658 have suggested that hyperosmotic changes induce fast changes in membrane tension 659 ( order of seconds to minutes ) followed by a volumetric change which is a separate and 660 longer process ( on the order hours ) [ 46 ] . The speed of the response that we characterize 661 in this study is driven by changes in membrane tension which demonstrate that the 662 16 organization of the microtubules and dynamics are significantly impaired and decreased 663 in PC2 KO cells ( Fig . 3 ) . This could suggest that the microtubules in the PC2 KO cells are 664 unable to sense changes in tension which can transmit the message to the plasma 665 membrane opening additional channels to allow for calcium influx . Therefore , although 666 other TRP channels may be involved in mediating hypoosmotically induced calcium 667 signaling , our data demonstrate that ER - localized PC2 in concert with the microtubules 668 are responsible for mediating the intracellular calcium release in response to 669 hyperosmolarity . It remains to be determined if ER - localized PC2 also contributes to 670 hypoosmotically driven calcium responses . 671 672 Osmotic changes induce the activation of cellular processes that are required for 673 cell adaptation , not just for renal epithelial cells but cells in other environments [ 47 ] . 674 Previous work on the PC2 homologue in fission yeast , Pkd2 , was previously shown to be 675 activated via osmotic stimuli [ 48 ] . Additionally , it has been shown that interaction of PC2 676 with cytoskeletal components can regulate PC2 channel activity [ 49 - 52 ] . Why is the 677 activation of ER - localized PC2 by hyperosmotic stimuli in renal epithelial cells important ? 678 In ADPKD patients , one of the early symptoms experienced is decreased urine 679 concentrating abilities [ 53 ] . Urine concentration in part occurs by the uptake of water into 680 the cells through the incorporation of AQP2 into the membrane through canonical ( AVP - 681 dependent ) and non - canonical pathways ( like hyperosmolarity ) [ 54 ] . Previous work has 682 pointed to the higher expression of AQP2 in ADPKD models , which were not based on 683 mutations or loss of polycystin proteins [ 55 , 56 ] . Therefore , how this pathway is affected 684 in ADPKD model remains unknown . In this study , we provide a mechanism by which the 685 tethering of the microtubules to the ER , mediated by PC2 and MAP4 , is disrupted by 686 phosphorylation of MAP4 with hyperosmotic stimulus , enabling AQP2 trafficking to the 687 membrane through a non - AVP pathway and that this mechanism of AQP2 trafficking is 688 impaired in a pre - cystic PC2 KO ADPKD model . Previous work has demonstrated that in 689 addition to stabilizing microtubules , MAP4 regulates the directionality of the cargo being 690 transported through the microtubules [ 57 - 59 ] . We demonstrate that there is a reciprocal 691 dependence in MAP4 / PC2 expression . When PC2 is knocked out , MAP4 expression is 692 decreased , whereas deletion of MAP4 increases PC2 expression ( Supp . Fig . 9 ) . 693 Therefore , both phosphorylation and decreased MAP4 expression not only affects 694 stability of the microtubules but the ability of cargo , like AQP2 vesicles , to be transported . 695 Moreover , the transport machinery that allows for these vesicles to travel through the 696 microtubules are calcium dependent [ 60 ] . Therefore , the absence of calcium signals in 697 the PC2 KO cells could additionally impair the transport machinery further exacerbating 698 the urine concentration deficiency as AQP2 channels are unable to be incorporated into 699 the membrane . Collectively , loss of these functions would lead to dilute urine , which is 700 seen in both our study here and in a pre - cystic PC1 KO mouse [ 61 ] as well as ADPKD 701 patients . 702 703 In this study we provide a physiological role of ER - localized PC2 in renal cells . We 704 demonstrate that the interaction between the ER and microtubules , mediated by PC2 and 705 MAP4 , are critical for signaling pathways like the incorporation of AQP2 into the 706 membrane of renal cells ( Fig . 8 ) . The novel interaction between PC2 and MAP4 provides 707 not only structural support for organelles , but the mechanism by which these external 708 17 cues are transmitted to intracellular signals . Here we demonstrate the physiological 709 implications of these interactions by linking how deletion of PC2 leads to decreased urine 710 osmolarity . These findings may also provide a contributing mechanism by which 711 circulating vasopressin levels are higher in ADPKD patients , as the collecting duct cells 712 have impaired water uptake , which in turn , will drive higher levels of circulating 713 vasopressin . Indeed , the only approved treatment for ADPKD that halts cyst growth is 714 tolvaptan which targets the V2R [ 62 , 63 ] , and for which AQP2 is the downstream target . 715 Thus , our findings provide foundational insights into PC2 biology by which impairment of 716 urine concentration can contribute to cyst development . In conclusion , hyperosmolarity is 717 a natural agonist that activates calcium release from ER - localized PC2 in the 718 osmosensing pathway by its interaction with the microtubules . 719 720 721 Acknowledgements : 722 We thank Dr .
