Methods : Data collected from a sample of twenty office - based urban / suburban general pediatricians consisted of : ( a ) a demographic survey about participants ' practice and computer use , ( b ) semi - structured interviews on their use of different types of information resources and ( c ) semi - structured interviews on perceptions of information needs and resource preferences in response to clinical vignettes representing cases in Genetics and Infectious Diseases . Content analysis of interviews provided participants ' perceived use of resources and their perceived questions and preferred resources in response to vignettes . Results : Participants ' average time in practice was 15 . 4 years ( 2 – 28 years ) . All had in - office online access . Participants identified specialist / generalist colleagues , general / specialty pediatric texts , drug formularies , federal government / professional organization Websites and medical portals ( when available ) as preferred information sources . They did not identify decision - making texts , evidence - based reviews , journal abstracts , medical librarians or consumer health information for routine office use . In response to clinical vignettes in Genetics and Infectious Diseases , participants identified Question Types about patient - specific ( diagnosis , history and findings ) and general medical ( diagnostic , therapeutic and referral guidelines ) information . They identified specialists and specialty textbooks , history and physical examination , colleagues and general pediatric textbooks , and federal and professional organizational Websites as information sources . Participants with access to portals identified them as information resources in lieu of texts . For Genetics vignettes , participants identified questions about prenatal history , disease etiology and treatment guidelines . For Genetics vignettes , they identified patient history , specialists , general pediatric texts , Web search engines and colleagues as information sources . For Infectious Diseases ( ID ) vignettes , participants identified questions about patients ' clinical status at presentation and questions about disease classification , diagnosis / therapy / referral guidelines and sources of patient education . For ID vignettes , they identified history , laboratory results , colleagues , specialists and personal experience as information sources . Conclusion : Content analysis of office - based general pediatricians ' responses to clinical vignettes provided a qualitative description of their perceptions of information needs and preferences for information resource for cases in Genetics and Infectious Diseases . This approach may provide complementary information for discovering practitioner ' s information needs and resource preferences in different contexts .

Collectively , these studies demon - strate distinctions in information resource preferences by pediatric practitioners in different clinical environments . A systematic review of information seeking behaviors of physicians in general [ 6 ] found wide variation of informa - tion resource preferences , distributed among colleagues , text sources and electronic databases , from which the authors inferred a need for further categorization of infor - mation needs and resources . Published studies on pediatricians ' information use have focused on hospital - based practitioners and house staff , although most pediatricians practice in office settings , away from medical libraries , librarians and hospital - based specialists [ 7 ] . Office - based practitioners have perspec - tives distinct from hospital - based practitioners that may influence their information needs and resource prefer - ences . Among these perspectives may be practical con - straints , such as the need to transport ( rather than manage ) unstable patients or the cost and space needed to maintain onsite repositories of information . In contrast to these constraints has been the increasing adoption of information and communication technolo - gies ( ICT ) into practice [ 8 ] . In addition to patient manage - ment tools such as electronic medical records ( EMRs ) , electronic prescribing and secure messaging , pediatric practitioners have a growing number of traditional and new electronic knowledge resources available by subscrip - tion and for free , from medical center libraries [ 9 , 10 ] , gov - ernment agencies [ 11 ] , professional organizations [ 12 ] and medical publishers . With increasing availability of telemedicine services [ 13 ] and marketing of inpatient spe - cialty services as " product " [ 14 ] , the information environ - ment of the academic medical center is expanding to include community physicians ' offices . Domain competencies for US pediatricians have tradi - tionally been defined by formal training curricula and board certification [ 15 ] , but information management competencies linked to professional certification mainte - nance for continuous professional development ( CPD ) [ 16 ] and evidence - based practice improvement [ 17 ] are evolving . The day - to - day management of knowledge and incorporation of evidence into care have not been well defined [ 18 ] and are part of an informal practitioner cur - riculum [ 19 ] , based on personal experience , availability and reputations of resources and local organizational cul - tures [ 20 ] that may influence what is and is not used . This pilot study explores information needs and resource preferences of ( a ) a characterized group of practitioners ( general pediatricians ) within ( b ) a characterized clinical workflow ( office - based practice ) for ( c ) problems in char - acterized domains ( genetics and infectious diseases ) using short clinical vignettes . Vignettes [ 21 ] have been used to teach and evaluate problem - solving skills and to elicit practitioners ' information needs [ 22 ] . Their advantages include cost effectiveness and case - mix control for new or rare conditions . Genetics and Infectious Diseases were chosen as two representative domains in which pediatri - cians receive formal training and clinical experience . In this study , we explore several questions : • Can vignettes be used to elicit information needs and resource preferences from a group of practitioners with common attributes , clinical environments and patient problems ? (cid:127) What are information needs and resource preferences of office - based general pediatricians , and are there commo - nalities with pediatricians in other settings ? Methods Design We conducted semi - structured interviews of twenty office - based general pediatricians to elicit their : ( a ) demo - graphic and computer use data , ( b ) verbalized uses of specified information resources and ( c ) " think aloud " per - ceptions of questions and identification of information resource preferences in response to short vignettes repre - senting clinical cases in genetics and infectious diseases . This study was approved by the appropriate institutional review board . Setting Participants were interviewed individually by telephone by one of the authors ( GRK ) . Subjects A sample of twenty general pediatricians was recruited from urban / suburban office - based practices responding to general calls for subjects through two professional pedi - atric group newsletters ( Winter - Spring 2004 ) , through hospital pediatric department and joint community prac - tice affiliations and through direct telephone / e - mail solic - itation . Participants were enrolled by telephone . Vignette creation Sixteen short vignettes [ See Additional file 1 ] representing hypothetical patients with problems in Genetics ( 8 ) or Infectious Diseases ( 8 ) were created to provide a variety of cases reflecting different combinations of familiarity , acu - ity and information problem ( diagnosis or therapy ) to BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2005 , 5 : 34 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1472 - 6947 / 5 / 34 Page 3 of 8 ( page number not for citation purposes ) general pediatricians . Domain experts in general pediat - rics reviewed all vignettes ( GRK , ELB , HPL ) for presenta - tion . Data collection The vignettes were randomized into non - repeating sequential groups of four vignettes and presented to par - ticipants by telephone in a standardized fashion . Partici - pants ' verbal responses were recorded and transcribed immediately post - interview for content analysis . Inter - views lasted approximately 30 minutes each . One partici - pant was replaced after it was discovered post - interview that the audio recorder had malfunctioned . For each of the twenty participants , after a standard intro - duction to the study and consent , data was collected in a continuous three - part fashion : 1 . In response to each of four sequential , randomized vignettes , the participant was asked to state perceptions of the questions presented by the vignette and how s / he would approach the problems in a " think - aloud " fashion [ 23 ] , indicating information resources that s / he would consult in managing or approach the vignette . For each information resource indicated , the participant was asked what s / he would do if the resource consulted did not have the answer , until the problem was " resolved " . 2 . In response to a list of medical and pediatric informa - tion resources , the participant was asked to state the types of questions , problems or information needs for which s / he would use each resource type . 3 . Information about demographics ( practice type , years in practice , computer and Internet availability ) was elic - ited . Data analysis Demographic information was tabulated for descriptive analysis [ see Results : Demographics ] . Indicated use of specific information resource types and their relative frequencies of indicated use ( using the par - ticipant - resource pair as the unit of analysis ) were tabu - lated for descriptive analysis [ see Additional file 2 and Results : Information resources survey ] . Transcribed responses to vignettes were coded consecu - tively according to the constant comparison method using open coding [ 24 ] to identify questions and information resources using the participant - vignette pair as the unit of analysis . Content analysis of interview transcripts was per - formed ( GRK , HPL ) using a combination of open - source software ( AnSWR [ 25 ] from the Centers for Disease Con - trol and Prevention ) and desktop relational database / spreadsheet tools . Discrepancies were resolved through discussion ( GRK , ELB ) . Codes representing questions perceived from vignettes were sorted into nine categories forming two broad cate - gories of Question Types about patient - specific and gen - eral medical information [ see Additional file 3 ] . Question Types involving general medical knowledge were mapped to the closest entity from a published taxonomy of Generic Questions [ 26 ] . Codes representing information resource preferences were sorted into Information Resource Types describing patient - specific and general medical information sources [ see Additional file 4 ] . Rela - tive frequencies of perceived Question Types [ see Addi - tional file 5 ] and identified Information Resource preferences for all vignettes and for vignettes according to domain ( genetics or infectious diseases ) [ see Additional file 6 ] were tabulated [ see Results : Responses to vignettes ] . Validation Validation of the results was by member - checking . A sum - mary of the results [ see Results ] was presented to all par - ticipants with a 90 % return . All returns concurred with the summary . Results Demographics Participants and work environments Twenty pediatricians ( 11 male , 9 female ) in urban / subur - ban pediatric practice participated . Average time in prac - tice was 15 . 4 yrs ( range 2 – 28 yrs , median 17 years ( male mean 17 . 5 yrs , median 19 yrs ; female mean 12 . 7 yrs , median 16 yrs ; t - test NS ) ) . Twelve participants classified their practices as private practice , 4 as managed care and 4 as free clinic / federally qualified health center . All 20 clas - sified their clinical work as general pediatrics , with 7 add - ing adolescent medicine , 2 adding adult medicine and 1 adding developmental pediatrics . Thirteen worked in pri - vate offices , 4 in multiple specialty settings , 2 in multi - site clinics and 1 in an expanded urgent care ( with limited well child care ) . Information resources and computer availability All participants shared office computers with Internet access in clinical areas . All had billing functions per - formed by separate computer systems . Twelve had access to a private networked computer , 10 used handheld com - puters , 6 had wireless access , 4 had mobile computers and 4 used electronic prescribing . Three used an EMR , 4 had access to an EMR that provided read - only capability . Three used computers in consultation rooms . Two had computers for other projects ( research and patient educa - tion ) . Twelve had the capability to communicate with their patients by e - mail , but only 2 did so more than very rarely .

Professional organization and federal health Websites ( in particular the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) were identified as sources of guidelines and other information . When com - mercial medical portals were available ( usually through institutional affiliation ) , they were frequently identified as a consulted information resource . Resources rarely or not identified as sources of informa - tion in the office included : algorithmic / flow - chart deci - sion - making texts , evidence - based medical reviews , medical journal abstracts , medical librarians or consumer health information . Several participants identified evi - dence - based medicine resources for specific problems or for self - education . Identified uses of resources Pediatric handbooks ( such as the Harriet Lane Handbook [ 27 ] ) were identified for drug dosing , cardiology informa - tion ( electrocardiogram interpretation , blood pressure / pulse normal values ) and disease - specific protocols . Gen - eral pediatric texts were identified as first resources for resolving differential diagnosis and management ques - tions , for general review and for self - education . Specialty texts were identified for domain - specific questions , with infectious disease ( AAP Red Book [ 28 ] ) , genetics ( Smith ' s Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation [ 29 ] ) and dermatology resources identified most frequently . Formu - laries were identified for questions on drug dosages , adverse reactions , packaging information , and for general information about drugs with which a participant had lit - tle or no experience . Guidelines and organizational policy statements , in particular those from the American Acad - emy of Pediatrics [ 30 ] , were identified for questions on disease management , for continuing education and for reference in policy - making . Generalist colleagues were identified for confirmation of findings and for discussion of diagnostic and manage - ment decisions . Specialists were identified as information resources in anticipation of referral . Contact with general - ist colleagues was usually face - to - face ( in the office ) while contact with specialists was via telephone and with a per - son or institution with which the participant had prior interaction or contact through an established referral net - work . The CDC Travel Health Website [ 31 ] was the most fre - quently identified online resource for current immuniza - tion and travel health information . The CDC Website [ 11 ] was also identified for general immunization informa - tion . The American Academy of Pediatrics general Website [ 12 ] was identified for policy statements , current profes - sional news and consumer health information . Commer - cial medical portals , when available , were identified in lieu of print textbooks . Responses to vignettes Frequently perceived question types Patient - specific question types Collectively , patient - specific Question Types regarding details about history , findings ( symptoms , signs , test results ) , diagnosis , and treatment plans were the most fre - quently perceived , followed by Question Types regarding current patient state ( stability , general appearance / condi - tion ) , social support and patient / family understanding of a condition . Participants also perceived pragmatic ques - tions about legal and insurance issues regarding minors in non - custodial care . Patient - specific questions about maternal , prenatal and birth history were perceived more frequently in response to Genetics vignettes and questions about patients ' appearance / condition were perceived more frequently in Infectious Disease vignettes . General medical question types Collectively , general medical Question Types regarding etiology , and treatment / diagnosis guidelines for a condi - tion were the most frequently perceived . General medical questions about disease etiology occurred more frequently in response to Genetics vignettes and questions about diagnosis / referral criteria and disease classification were perceived more frequently in Infectious Disease vignettes . Most general medical Question Types posed by partici - pants had correspondences to Generic Medical Questions in the taxonomy developed by Ely et al [ 26 ] , however , there were two for which there were no explicit matches : (cid:127) " What are the classifications of a disease ? " ( to decide on an approach to management ) : (cid:127) " . . . what type of sickle cell [ the patient ] has , if he has SS [ a type of sickle cell disease ] or one of the more favorable ones . . . " (cid:127) " . . . what type of school failure , is it in one area , speech ? " (cid:127) " What is available treatment ? " ( to locate new and uncommon resources ) : BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2005 , 5 : 34 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1472 - 6947 / 5 / 34 Page 5 of 8 ( page number not for citation purposes ) (cid:127) " . . . what treatments are available , what ' s experimental ? If it exists , where is it provided ? Would [ the patient ] qualify for participation in a study ? " (cid:127) " What is the latest therapy available for patients with a disease X ? " Frequently identified information resources Collectively , specialists were the most frequently identi - fied Information Resource Type . They were also the most frequently identified last resource when an answer could not otherwise be found . Patient - specific resources The most frequently identified patient - specific resources were patient history and examination , followed records from and communication with previous providers and institutions ( inpatient hospital or nursery ) , which were similar for both Genetics and Infectious Diseases vignettes . General medical resources After specialists , the most frequently identified general medical resources were specialty and general pediatric texts and colleagues ( pediatric generalists ) , although par - ticipants with access to medical portals indicated them as resources in lieu of texts . Participants also identified Web search engines , guidelines from professional organiza - tions ( American Academy of Pediatrics ) and local institu - tions ( hospitals , social services , health departments , schools ) . For Genetics vignettes , genetic specialists , dysmorphology texts / atlases and genetic databases ( Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ( OMIM ) [ 32 ] ) were more frequently identified than for Infectious Diseases vignettes , for which specialists in infectious disease and other domains , infec - tious disease texts and guidelines ( in particular the AAP Red Book ) , federal and local government resources ( CDC Website and local health departments , schools and social services ) and their own experience and training were more frequently identified . Discussion Emerging model The information process of physicians in patient care has been described as iterations of inquiries / interventions ( history , examination , diagnostic testing , treatment ) and responses to updates of a patient ' s clinical status and / or a practitioner ' s information state [ 33 ] . Parallel to this proc - ess is the process by which decisions are made about fur - ther inquiries / interventions , for which the practitioner may need to consult external resources [ 34 ] . Practitioners anticipate information needs by organizing and maintaining " personal information collections , defined as subsets of . . . information . . . that individuals [ build ] conceptually and physically over time " [ 35 ] , including " sources and channels . . . that can be located again easily . " These preferences follow a principle of " least effort " [ 36 ] , in which selection of resources ( tools ) are optimized to meet needs ( jobs ) in terms of the effort and cost to maintain and use them . Characterization of such collections and their use by prac - titioners may be helpful on several fronts . First , it can help plan placement of resources to promote their effective use . It has recently been suggested that the way to promote evi - dence - based medical practice is to promote information management [ 37 ] . Second , it may help to determine prac - titioner training needs ( knowing what questions to ask and what resources to use ) in problems of new awareness . A recent systematic review [ 38 ] suggests that the longer physicians are practice , the greater their need for quality improvement interventions . Third , it may help practition - ers develop and maintain situational awareness ( SA ) of information as it relates to patient care , practice improve - ment and professional development . SA of clinical infor - mation has been described within an intensive care unit ( ICU ) [ 39 ] , but not within physician offices . Lastly , it may help determine factors that influence practitioners to use specific resource types . Participants ' information needs In response to vignettes , patient - specific questions focused on patient history , examination and manage - ment . General medical questions focused on etiology , diagnostic / therapeutic management and guidelines . For Genetics vignettes , participants perceived questions about disease etiology more frequently than for Infectious Dis - ease vignettes , for which they perceived questions about diagnostic and referral guidelines , disease classification and sources of patient education materials . In comparison to an analysis of patient care questions asked at an academic medical center ( AMC ) , the office - based ( OB ) participants perceived a higher relative fre - quency of questions about diagnosis and no questions about drugs . Reasons to explain this may include : 1 ) the OB group used hypothetical patients whereas the AMC - derived group used actual patients , 2 ) the OB group used only outpatient settings ( where patient diagnoses are usu - ally not known prior to the encounter ) whereas more than half ( 58 . 8 % ) of the AMC - derived questions were gener - ated from inpatient settings ( where patients ' admitting diagnoses are known ) , 3 ) the OB group used hypothetical encounters ( where details of therapy may not be speci - fied ) , whereas the AMC - derived group used actual patient cases and 4 ) the vignettes elicited questions about hypo - BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2005 , 5 : 34 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1472 - 6947 / 5 / 34 Page 6 of 8 ( page number not for citation purposes ) thetical cases in genetics and infectious diseases , whereas the AMC - derived questions came from patients from a number of different domains . Question taxonomies As noted in the AMC study of pediatricians ' questions , the participants ' questions fell within a few Generic Ques - tions from the taxonomy derived from ethnographic observation of family practitioners . Interestingly , partici - pants perceived two Question Types that did not have spe - cific matches within the taxonomy : questions about disease classifications and about sources of the best and latest care for a disease . One suggestion that has been made is that pediatricians may have different information needs from family practitioners [ 1 ] . To express information needs of a group of practitioners , a question taxonomy should : a ) match their perspectives ( Example : parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluids are largely inpatient , not outpatient objects ) , the inventory ( of objects / relationships ) relevant to that perspective ( Exam - ple : nutrition and immunizations may be therapy , but are not drugs ) and the granularity ( of knowledge ) needed ( Example : parenteral nutrition , infant formula and breast - feeding are distinct and important forms of nutrition ) to express concepts and information needs easily and clearly [ 40 ] . The Generic Question taxonomy , while important , may not sufficiently express the practical information needs of pediatricians . Participants ' information resources Within the context of Genetics and Infectious Diseases ( as represented in these vignettes ) , participants identified a relatively small , but common set of defined resource types ( general and specialty pediatric texts , generalist col - leagues ) . They named a few specific , trusted online resources , although some were comfortable with " open " Web searching . They identified trusted and established sources of specialty care ( frequently through a medical center ) , reachable by phone . In comparison to AMC pediatricians , office - based general pediatricians have similar resource preferences , but also identified community resources , including the patient ' s family and social environment ( school , etc . ) . Participants identified specific Websites ( CDC , AAP ) and medical por - tals when available ( through academic affiliations ) as trusted sources . In contrast to AMC - defined roles of " fac - ulty " and " resident , " participants identified in - office col - leagues as informal consultants and specialists ( by phone ) as formal consultants . Specialists were frequently identi - fied as " last " resource if an answer could not otherwise be found . The use of vignettes The described use of vignettes can generate a description of information resource use , but it does not provide infor - mation on what users actually do . It also does not provide information on barriers to pursuing answers to questions . It is not intended to supplant other methods of discover - ing information needs ( such as surveys , interviews and ethnographic observations ) , but as a way of exploring information needs and resource preferences in a flexible and low - cost fashion . It may be useful in " fine - tuning " exploration of information needs and resource prefer - ences : (cid:127) Vignettes about rare or new conditions may be used to identify practitioners ' unrecognized information needs and / or to guide the development and deployment of new information resources to fulfill needs (cid:127) Vignettes about new morbidities may be used to identify the unrecognized practitioner information needs and / or to guide the development of practitioner education and awareness programs In addition to the qualitative frequency analyses described in this paper , exploratory factor analysis of the results may be used to discover categories of resources that may help determine their selection by practitioners in different cir - cumstances ( using a Hierarchy of Abstraction Model [ 41 ] ) . Conclusion Using content analysis of semi - structured responses to short clinical vignettes in the domains of genetics and infectious diseases , we have explored information needs and resource preferences of office - based general pediatri - cians . This approach yielded descriptive information that demonstrates commonalities and distinctions with other studies on the information needs of general pediatricians .
