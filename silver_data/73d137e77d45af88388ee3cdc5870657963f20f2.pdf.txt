Ferguson Personality Social Psychology and Health ( PSPH ) Group , School of Psychology , University of Nottingham , Nottingham , UK Received : 8 April 2013 , revised 10 July 2013 , accepted 13 August 2013 , published online 9 October 2013 Background and Objectives While blood donation is traditionally described as a behaviour motivated by pure altruism , the assessment of altruism in the blood donation literature has not been theoretically informed . Drawing on theories of altruism from psychology , economics and evolutionary biology , it is argued that a theoretically derived psychometric assessment of altruism is needed . Such a measure is developed in this study that can be used to help inform both our understanding of the altruistic motives of blood donors and recruitment interven - tion strategies . Materials and Methods A cross - sectional survey ( N = 414 ) , with a 1 - month behavioural follow - up ( time 2 , N = 77 ) , was designed to assess theoretically derived constructs from psychological , economic and evolutionary biological theories of altruism . Theory of planned behaviour ( TPB ) variables and co - operation were also assessed at time 1 and a measure of behavioural co - operation at time 2 . Results Five theoretical dimensions ( impure altruism , kinship , self - regarding motives , reluctant altruism and egalitarian warm glow ) of altruism were identi - ﬁed through factor analyses . These ﬁve altruistic motives differentiated blood donors from non - donors ( donors scored higher on impure altruism and reluctant altruism ) , showed incremental validity over TPB constructs to predict donor intention and predicted future co - operative behaviour . Conclusions These ﬁndings show that altruism in the context of blood donation is multifaceted and complex and , does not reﬂect pure altruism . This has implication for recruitment campaigns that focus solely on pure altruism . Key words : altruism , blood donors , motivation , reciprocity , recruitment . Introduction Without volunteer blood donors , a large proportion of health service provision ( e . g . elective surgery ) would not be possible . However , only around 5 % of the eligible population donates blood at any one time [ 1 ] with short - ages often reported [ 2 ] making blood donor recruitment vital . Recruitment campaigns generally focus on altruism [ 3 , 4 ] as ( 1 ) blood donation is considered an archetypal altruistic act [ 4 ] and ( 2 ) altruism is the most common self - reported motive for blood donation [ 5 ] . However , while altruism reﬂects a number of related theoretical processes ( e . g . reciprocity , warm glow ) identiﬁed in psy - chology [ 6 ] , economics [ 7 ] and evolutionary biology [ 8 , 9 ] , in blood donor researcher , it is typically assessed as a single construct . Moreover , generic altruism - based slo - gans , such as ‘Do something amazing : save a life . Give blood’ , do not reﬂect these processes , and therefore , the motivational focus of recruitment campaigns may not match donor motives [ 10 , 11 ] . The main aim of this study , therefore , is to develop more substantive , theoretically informed multidimensional index of blood donors’ altruistic motivations .

Altruism and blood donation Although theory indicates that altruistic acts are based on a number of motives , no multidimensional measure of motives underlying altruism exists for blood dona - tion . Seven theory - driven motives for altruistic behav - iour can be identiﬁed from psychological , economic and evolutionary biological literatures . First , pure altru - ism describes an individual’s ultimate desire to help others at a personal cost , without reward [ 6 ] . Second , warm glow describes the personal beneﬁt arising through positive emotional gains from the act of dona - tion [ 7 ] . Combining warm glow and pure altruism results in impure altruism , whereby the individual donates both to attain warm glow and to beneﬁt others [ 7 ] . Psychometric [ 12 ] and behavioural economic [ 13 ] evi - dence shows that warm glow motivations underlie blood donor helping preferences . Third , reluctant altru - ism describes when co - operation occurs due to a lack of trust that others will donate [ 12 ] . Fourth , social responsibility [ 14 ] reﬂects a sense of duty to donate blood , which may overcome tendencies to free riding that economic theory proposes occurs with respect to providing public goods like blood [ 7 ] . Fifth , hedonism is an egoistic motive , whereby helping is used to increase personal gains without concern for the recipi - ent’s welfare [ 6 ] . The desire to receive a gift for donat - ing or get free health checks may represent hedonistic motives for blood donation [ 15 ] . Sixth , reputation building operates via indirect reciprocity , with people more likely to help those who have a good reputation for helping [ 8 , 9 ] . Finally , kin selection suggests that individuals show preferential helping towards family members [ 9 ] . These seven motives may be differentially related to blood donation . Pure altruism is believed to be the archetypal motivation for blood donation [ 4 ] . However , Ferguson et al . [ 12 , 16 ] have shown that warm glow is also a predictor for blood donation . Donations may not be sustained by reputation , as only a small proportion of blood donors seeking social recognition [ 5 , 17 ] . However , this does not preclude that reputation is part of the multidimensional space for blood donor’s altruis - tic motivations . Kinship , although reported by blood donors as a motive [ 14 ] , is also unlikely to sustain donation because blood cannot be donated directly to relatives . With respect to hedonism , the typical small rewards ( e . g . tea and biscuits ) may be insufﬁcient to outweigh the high costs of donation . Consistent with this , Ferguson et al . [ 16 ] found that such hedonistic motives were not correlated with intentions to donate blood . Finally , moral norms for social duty have been linked directly to the intention to donate blood [ 18 ] . However , while blood donors endorse multiple motives [ 19 ] , motives such as reputation building have never been assessed , due to the lack of a suitable measure - ment tool . As such , hypotheses concerning reputation building and blood donation cannot be directly tested . While proposed as seven distinct processes , these motives may not be distinct . For example , a sense of social and moral duty may be linked to a sense of warm glow as people may also derive warm glow from meeting societies needs as well as their own [ 12 , 16 ] . Duty and reluctant altruism may seem similar , with donors acting in the face of others inaction , with both driven by a sense of moral worth in terms of what should be done . However , reluctant altruism is more likely also driven by a sense of frustration with others inaction , whereas duty is likely dri - ven by a sense of pleasing others by doing the right thing . Thus , while correlated they should be distinct motivations . The multidimensional measure of altruism for blood donors will enable such hypotheses to be examined . Theory of planned behaviour , blood donation and altruism The theory of planned behaviour ( TPB ) [ 20 ] has been the main psychological framework applied to study blood donation behaviour [ 1 ] . TPB suggests that behaviour is determined by intentions to act , with intentions predicted by subjective norms , attitudes , and perceived behavioural control ( PBC ) [ 20 ] . Intention is the key determinant of blood donation [ 1 , 21 ] . Evidence suggests that incorporat - ing a single altruistic motive within a TPB framework improves the prediction of blood donor intentions [ 18 ] . Therefore , this study aims to extend previous work by ( i ) examining the associations between multiple motivations underlying altruism and the components of the TPB and ( ii ) examine whether the various altruistic motives show incremental validity over TPB variables with respect to blood donation intentions . Summary This study aims to develop a theory - driven index of motivations underlying altruism associated with blood donation and examines its validity by demonstrating its ability to ( i ) show meaningful correlations with TPB vari - ables , especially intentions , ( ii ) show meaningful differ - ences between blood donors and non - donors , ( iii ) predict future co - operative behaviour and ( iv ) show incremental validity over TPB variables with respect to predicting behavioural intentions to donate blood . Secondly , this study aims to explore the impact of recruitment slogans © 2013 The Authors . Vox Sanguinis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . Altruism and blood donation 119 ( altruism vs . benevolence vs . control ) on intentions , altru - istic motives and co - operative behaviour . 1 Materials and methods Participants and design The cross - sectional survey design also incorporated a lon - gitudinal component with participants completing mea - sures of altruism and TPB ( including intentions ) at time 1 ( T1 ) and a measure of intention at time 2 ( T2 ) , 1 month later . At T1 , 414 participants provided data ( 91 % response rate : 36 participants either did not return the question - naire or did not complete the consent form or left a whole section blank ) . All participants were university stu - dents selected through convenience sampling and aged between 17 and 39 years [ M = 20 (cid:1) 06 , SD = 2 (cid:1) 38 , 254 ( 62 % women ) and one with sex unspeciﬁed ] . Two hun - dred and sixty - six participants provided emails at T1 to be contacted at T2 , and at T2 , 77 participants responded to the email request [ age range = 18 – 27 , M = 19 (cid:1) 93 , SD = 1 (cid:1) 84 , 55 ( 71 % women ) ] . Those who replied at T2 were not signiﬁcantly different in terms of age , sex or donor status from those who did not reply ( all P s > 0 (cid:1) 05 ) . Participants self - reported their ethnicity ( 9 (cid:1) 5 % not pro - viding a description ) to the question ‘What is your ethnic - ity ? ’ This resulted in 41 different descriptions ( coded verbatim ) . The majority ( 43 (cid:1) 7 % ) described themselves as White people British , followed by 19 (cid:1) 4 % describing them - selves as White . We recoded the data as White ( = 1 ) if par - ticipants explicitly described themselves as White and others ( = 0 ) if not . However , this meant that participants describing themselves as just Australian ( N = 1 ) or British ( N = 65 ) for example were classed as ‘other’ but could potentially be White . Given the self - report nature of these data and these types of coding concerns , they offer a pri - marily descriptive account of the sample . 2 Measures ( Time 1 ) Blood donor status : Past blood donation behaviour was assessed by asking participants ‘Have you ever success - fully donated blood ? ’ ( Yes / No ) [ 1 , 17 ] , which is a com - monly used and reliable measure of blood donor status [ 3 , 23 ] . Motives for blood donation : To assess the seven altru - istic motives , participants indicated on a seven - point Lik - ert - type scale ( 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree ) how much they agreed with 24 statements that began with the stem ‘ I would donate blood because … ’ Pure altruism : Pure altruism was measured by three items ( e . g . ‘by donating blood I could save someone’s life’ ) [ 16 ] . Warm glow : Four items provided a measure of warm glow ( e . g . ‘I would feel good about myself after donat - ing ) [ 12 ] . Reluctant altruism : Reluctant altruism was measured by three items ( e . g . ‘I cannot trust others to donate blood’ ) [ 12 ] . Social responsibility : The strength of social responsi - bility was measured by four items ( e . g . ‘if I gave blood I would be fulﬁlling my duty to society’ ) [ 16 ] . Hedonism : Hedonism was measured by four items ( e . g . ‘I can take time off work or lectures’ ) [ 18 ] . Reputation : Three items were used to measure reputa - tion building ( e . g . ‘I would want to let members of the opposite sex know I am a good , kind person’ ) [ 24 ] . Kinship : Three items measured kinship ( e . g . ‘if I gave blood there is more of a chance of close relatives receiving it if they need it’ ) [ 16 ] . TPB constructs : The TPB constructs were scored such that high scores equated to higher intention , positive attitudes , subjective norm and PBC ( all items were scored on seven - point Likert - type scales ) . Intentions : Four items measured intention ( e . g . ‘I plan to donate blood at the next possible opportunity’ ) . Attitudes : Attitudes were measured by four bipolar adjectives with the stem ‘ My donating blood at the next possible opportunity would be … ’ ( e . g . ‘ bad – good ’ ) [ 18 ] . Subjective norm : Subjective norm composed of two items ( e . g . ‘It is expected of me that I donate blood at the next possible opportunity’ ) . PBC : PBC was measured by two items ( e . g . ‘My donat - ing blood at the next possible opportunity is up to me’ ) . 1 A secondary aim of this study was to explore experimentally , if manipulating an altruistic recruitment slogan inﬂuenced inten - tions to donate blood . As such , participants were randomly allo - cated to one of three conditions ( control , altruism slogan and benevolence slogan : 150 per cell ) . The altruism slogan [ 22 ] stated ‘Do something amazing : save a life . Give blood’ and the warm - glow slogan [ 12 , 13 ] ‘So save a life : give blood . It will make you feel good’ [ 14 , 19 ] , and the control condition no slogan . Chi - square tests revealed that the participants in the control , altruism and benevolence condition did not signiﬁcantly differ in terms of sex ( woman = 58 % , 66 % and 61 (cid:1) 7 % ) or blood donor status ( blood donor = 26 (cid:1) 6 % , 24 (cid:1) 4 % and 26 (cid:1) 2 % ) , all P s > 0 (cid:1) 05 . Manipu - lation checks revealed that participants in the standard ( altruism ) condition reported that the slogan focused more on saving a life ( M = 6 (cid:1) 05 , SE = 0 (cid:1) 09 ) than those in the benevolence condition [ M = 5 (cid:1) 25 , SE = 0 (cid:1) 12 , t ( 254 (cid:1) 23 ) = 5 (cid:1) 29 , P < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) . As there were no signiﬁcant effects of recruitment slogans on either TPB variables or altruism motives , these results are not reported here and the sample collapsed across conditions . 2 When we entered the White vs other categories into the analyses reported , it did not signiﬁcantly alter the results . © 2013 The Authors . Vox Sanguinis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . 120 R . Evans & E . Ferguson Co - operative Behaviour : A validated behavioural index of co - operation was assessed [ 25 ] in terms of a positive response to the request to leave an email to be contacted for the follow - up ( email co - operation ) ( coded 1 if they left and email and 0 if they did not ) . Follow - up at 1 month ( Time 2 ) Intentions : Participants who provided their email were contacted 1 month later and asked ‘ To what extent do you intend to give blood in the future ? ’ measured on a seven - point Likert scale from 1 = not likely to 7 = highly likely . Co - operative Behaviour : A positive behavioural response ( reply ) to the email request 1 month later ( behavioural co - operation ) indexed behavioural co - operation [ 25 ] . This was coded 1 if they replied to the email and 0 if they did not . Thus , all those who pro - vided an email but did not reply were coded as zero . Procedure Participants were approached to take part individually or in groups , by a single experimenter ( blind to condition and donor status ) at lecture halls , cafes and social spaces . The study gained approval from the university ethics board . Statistical analysis Imputation procedures were used to deal with any miss - ing data [ 26 , 27 ] . If less than 10 % of the data are missing and no more than 10 % of data are missing for a single variable , then single imputation ( SI ) is sufﬁcient [ 28 ] . A sensitivity analysis will be conducted comparing the analyses on the imputed data with the data set with miss - ing data listwise - deleted . If the results are the same and conform to the theoretical predictions , then conﬁdence can be expressed in the results [ 29 ] . A number of the altruism scales have only three items as such the mean interitem correlations ( MICs ) are the appropriate index of reliability and should be > 0 (cid:1) 30 [ 30 ] . Results Missing data For the 24 altruistic motives , there was 0 (cid:1) 2 – 0 (cid:1) 7 % missing data on any one variable . For TPB variables , the ﬁgures were 0 (cid:1) 5 – 5 (cid:1) 1 % . These data were not missing completely at random [ Little’s v 2 ( 1181 , N = 410 ) = 1322 (cid:1) 01 , P < 0 (cid:1) 05 ] . However , the pattern of missingness was not signiﬁcantly associated with the auxiliary variables of age and sex , indicating that these data were potentially missing at random [ 28 ] . With < 10 % missing data , a single imputation was conducted for the altruism motives ﬁrst . To achieve this , fully conditional speciﬁcation MI was used with 10 replications ( age and sex as auxiliary variables ) and one of the ten MI replications data sets chosen at ran - dom . This single data set was then used to MI the missing TPB variables ( again 10 replications ) and again one of the 10 data sets selected at random . While the results based on the imputed data are reported in this study , they are the same for the list - wise - deleted data . Descriptive Statistics Of the 414 participants , four incorrectly answered a knowledge question , pertaining to the slogan manipula - tion . These were excluded from data analysis . 3 In the ﬁnal sample of 410 , 75 % had never donated blood ( N = 307 ) and 25 % reported having donated blood ( N = 103 ) . At T1 , 266 ( 65 % ) of participants left their email address , of these 219 were contacted 1 month later ( not all were contactable due to illegible email addresses or emails that no longer were operational ) for follow - up questions , with 77 ( 35 % ) replying to the email . Consistent with previous research , [ 16 , 31 ] blood donors were more likely than non - blood donor to leave their email address , v 2 ( 1 , N = 410 ) = 4 (cid:1) 79 , P < 0 (cid:1) 05 . There were no signiﬁ - cant differences between blood donors and non - blood donors in terms of sex , v 2 ( 1 , N = 410 ) = 1 (cid:1) 86 , P > 0 (cid:1) 05 ( 56 (cid:1) 3 % vs . 63 (cid:1) 8 % ) or age ( 20 (cid:1) 47 vs . 19 (cid:1) 93 ) . Exploratory factor analysis The suitability of the 24 altruistic motives for EFA ( prin - cipal axis factoring with oblique rotation ) was indicated by a Kaiser – Meyer – Olkin of 0 (cid:1) 84 and a signiﬁcant Bartlett’s test of sphericity [ v 2 ( 276 ) = 4606 (cid:1) 82 , P < 0 (cid:1) 01 ] . Parallel analysis , with 100 replications , indicated a ﬁve - factor solution ( Table 1 ) . The ﬁrst factor reﬂected a blend of items measuring pure altruism , social responsi - bility and warm glow . This factor was termed ‘impure altruism’ . The second factor included all the items mea - suring reputation and hedonism ; thus , it was termed ‘self - regarding’ . All three items measuring kinship and friendship loaded onto the third factor . The fourth factor included all three items measuring reluctant altruism . 3 This is so the sample contained only those who were deemed to have engaged with the study , including these subjects did not alter the results . © 2013 The Authors . Vox Sanguinis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . Altruism and blood donation 121 The ﬁfth factor was a blend of the remaining items from the social responsibility and warm glow scales . This factor was termed ‘egalitarian warm glow’ . The coefﬁ - cient alphas and MICs ( Table 1 ) indicate that these were reliable factors . Donor history Three logistic regression analyses ( Table 2 ) examined the associations between donor history and TPB variables and the altruistic motives . The initial analyses explore the TPB variable on their own , the second explore the motives on their own , and the third examined their joint effect . Across these analyses , intentions and attitudes from TPB and impure and reluctant altruism from the motives are positively associated with being a blood donor . Associations with TPB variables at time 1 Table 3 shows that for non - donors intention to donate blood at time 1 was positively correlated with impure altruism , egalitarian warm glow and kinship . For blood donors , intentions were positively correlated with impure altruism and reluctant altruism . Intentions at T1 was also positively correlated with intentions at T2 ( r = 0 (cid:1) 80 , Impure altruism Self - regarding Kinship Reluctant altruism Egalitarian warm glow Save someones life 0 (cid:1) 76 - 0 (cid:1) 07 - 0 (cid:1) 05 - 0 (cid:1) 06 - 0 (cid:1) 02 Help others 0 (cid:1) 74 - 0 (cid:1) 07 - 0 (cid:1) 01 - 0 (cid:1) 10 0 (cid:1) 06 Right thing to do 0 (cid:1) 62 0 (cid:1) 04 - 0 (cid:1) 02 0 (cid:1) 18 - 0 (cid:1) 10 Feel proud by helping 0 (cid:1) 62 0 (cid:1) 11 - 0 (cid:1) 03 - 0 (cid:1) 16 - 0 (cid:1) 32 Responsible for helping others 0 (cid:1) 60 0 (cid:1) 01 - 0 (cid:1) 11 0 (cid:1) 21 - 0 (cid:1) 04 World would be a better place if everyone who could gave blood 0 (cid:1) 50 - 0 (cid:1) 01 - 0 (cid:1) 13 0 (cid:1) 35 - 0 (cid:1) 07 Feel good about myself 0 (cid:1) 38 0 (cid:1) 30 - 0 (cid:1) 06 - 0 (cid:1) 21 - 0 (cid:1) 20 Show people that I am a good , kind person 0 (cid:1) 08 0 (cid:1) 80 - 0 (cid:1) 07 - 0 (cid:1) 26 - 0 (cid:1) 04 Let my friends know that I am a good , kind person 0 (cid:1) 05 0 (cid:1) 79 - 0 (cid:1) 04 - 0 (cid:1) 16 - 0 (cid:1) 10 Free tea and biscuits 0 (cid:1) 04 0 (cid:1) 65 0 (cid:1) 08 0 (cid:1) 16 0 (cid:1) 12 Let members of the opposite sex know I am a good , kind person - 0 (cid:1) 21 0 (cid:1) 63 0 (cid:1) 02 0 (cid:1) 05 - 0 (cid:1) 11 Receive stickers , badges and pins - 0 (cid:1) 05 0 (cid:1) 60 0 (cid:1) 01 0 (cid:1) 15 0 (cid:1) 03 Time off work or lectures - 0 (cid:1) 33 0 (cid:1) 46 - 0 (cid:1) 04 0 (cid:1) 10 - 0 (cid:1) 10 Free blood tests / blood typing 0 (cid:1) 08 0 (cid:1) 44 - 0 (cid:1) 04 0 (cid:1) 14 0 (cid:1) 03 Chance of family receiving it - 0 (cid:1) 06 - 0 (cid:1) 03 - 0 (cid:1) 99 - 0 (cid:1) 07 0 (cid:1) 08 Close relatives receive it - 0 (cid:1) 04 - 0 (cid:1) 01 - 0 (cid:1) 87 - 0 (cid:1) 01 - 0 (cid:1) 03 Friends receiving it 0 (cid:1) 05 0 (cid:1) 00 - 0 (cid:1) 77 0 (cid:1) 07 0 (cid:1) 02 Someone has to 0 (cid:1) 11 - 0 (cid:1) 05 - 0 (cid:1) 11 0 (cid:1) 63 - 0 (cid:1) 20 Other people cant , I would have to 0 (cid:1) 12 0 (cid:1) 19 - 0 (cid:1) 08 0 (cid:1) 47 - 0 (cid:1) 01 Cannot trust others - 0 (cid:1) 17 0 (cid:1) 12 - 0 (cid:1) 03 0 (cid:1) 38 - 0 (cid:1) 06 Personally rewarding experience 0 (cid:1) 30 0 (cid:1) 02 0 (cid:1) 03 - 0 (cid:1) 10 - 0 (cid:1) 65 Make me feel physically good - 0 (cid:1) 16 0 (cid:1) 05 - 0 (cid:1) 05 0 (cid:1) 03 - 0 (cid:1) 63 Duty to society 0 (cid:1) 04 - 0 (cid:1) 01 - 0 (cid:1) 02 0 (cid:1) 22 - 0 (cid:1) 62 Give back to the community 0 (cid:1) 32 - 0 (cid:1) 12 - 0 (cid:1) 12 0 (cid:1) 02 - 0 (cid:1) 54 a 0 (cid:1) 83 0 (cid:1) 83 0 (cid:1) 89 0 (cid:1) 64 0 (cid:1) 75 MIC 0 (cid:1) 44 0 (cid:1) 41 0 (cid:1) 74 0 (cid:1) 38 0 (cid:1) 45 Coefﬁcients greater than 0 (cid:1) 30 ( in bold ) indicate that the item loads on the designated factor .

Ferguson P < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) , indicating a high degree of stability in behavioural intentions . Incremental validity : behavioural co - operation at times 1 and 2 Logistic regression ( Table 4 ) was used to explore whether blood donor altruistic motives predict who is likely to perform a behavioural act of co - operation ( 1 ) leaving their email address for follow - up ( N = 266 who did vs . 144 who did not ) and ( 2 ) of those who left their email who actually responded to the email at T2 ( 219 were con - tacted and 77 replied ) . 4 These analyses explore whether motives have effects over and above sex and intentions assessed at T1 . Analyses were conducted separately for donors and non - donors . The results show that intentions predict initial co - operation at time 1 but not at time 2 . However , at T2 , behavioural co - operation was positively associated with both self - regarding motives and egalitar - ian warm glow for blood donors . Incremental validity : intentions at time 1 Table 5 shows the results for incremental validity of the altruism motivations over TPB variables , with respect to predicting intentions for blood donors and non - donors . For non - donors , all TPB variables predicted intention at time 1 . There was no signiﬁcant improvement in prediction when altruistic motives were added in step two . For blood donors , all three TPB variables predicted intentions at time 1 . At step two , there was a signiﬁcant improvement in prediction by altruistic motives , with impure altruism positively contributing to the prediction of intentions to donate and kin motives inhibiting inten - tions . Discussion This study identiﬁed ﬁve motives underlying altruism associated with blood donation : reluctant altruism , kin - ship , impure altruism , self - regarding motives and egali - tarian warm glow . These ﬁve altruistic motives not only showed factorial validity , but differentiated blood donors from non - donors , showed incremental validity over TPB constructs and predicted future co - operative behaviour . As such , the measure shows good initial psychometric properties . Furthermore , these altruistic motives were differentially related to intentions to donate blood , with a different pattern shown for blood donors and non - donors . Blood donation and altruism The ﬁnding that blood donation is not motivated solely by pure altruism is not to imply that the act of blood donation is selﬁsh . Indeed , impure altruism , whereby individuals donate to both beneﬁt others and gain emo - tional warm glow , was a predictor of blood donation intentions [ 7 , 12 , 13 , 16 ] . The additional pairing of ‘warm glow’ with ‘social responsibility’ is compatible with the conception of an egalitarian blood donor [ 13 ] , with the blood donor driven by a desire to contribute to society , coupled with a sense of personal satisfaction from donating . This combination of motives represents unconditional helping [ 32 ] , where it is the act of helping , to gain warm glow , that is crucial , rather than the char - acteristics of the recipient . This type of helping motiva - tion , based on warm glow , is a key concept for blood Table 2 Logistic regression predicting blood donor status Donor status Donor status Donor status Step 1 R 2 = 0 (cid:1) 16 , Step v 2 = 48 (cid:1) 36 ( P < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) R 2 = 0 (cid:1) 16 , Step v 2 = 48 (cid:1) 38 ( P < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) Intentions 0 (cid:1) 06 * * 0 (cid:1) 06 * * Attitudes 0 (cid:1) 10 * * 0 (cid:1) 10 * * Subjective norm 0 (cid:1) 03 0 (cid:1) 03 PBC 0 (cid:1) 01 0 (cid:1) 01 Step 2 R 2 = 0 (cid:1) 08 , Step v 2 = 23 (cid:1) 67 ( P < 0 (cid:1) 001 ) R 2 = 0 (cid:1) 20 , Step v 2 = 9 (cid:1) 93 ( P = 0 (cid:1) 07 ) Impure altruism 0 (cid:1) 10 * * * 0 (cid:1) 06 * Self - regarding - 0 (cid:1) 01 - 0 (cid:1) 002 Kinship - 0 (cid:1) 04 - 0 (cid:1) 03 Reluctant altruism 0 (cid:1) 08 * * 0 (cid:1) 07 * Egalitarian warm glow - 0 (cid:1) 02 - 0 (cid:1) 05 * P < 0 (cid:1) 05 , * * P = < 0 (cid:1) 01 , * * * P = < 0 (cid:1) 001 .

Vox Sanguinis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . Altruism and blood donation 123 donation , as the characteristics of recipients are always unknown to the donor . For non - donors , both egalitarian warm glow and impure altruism were associated with the intention to donate ; how - ever , for blood donors , only the latter was a signiﬁcant pre - dictor . This is generally consistent with previous work [ 12 ] and indicates that different motivates associated with altru - ism have different predictive value for donors and non - donors . Indeed , reluctant altruism ( i . e . the desire to donate blood due to a lack of trust that others will donate ) is a newly deﬁned aspect of altruism with speciﬁc rele - vance to blood donation and requires further study [ 12 ] . The dimensions of impure altruism and kinship added incremental predictive power , with respect to intentions for blood donors only . Interestingly , believing that kin / friends would beneﬁt reduces intention to donate . Thus , potentially educating people to correct this erroneous belief may help sustain blood donation .

Ferguson These results indicate that a more complete under - standing of the psychological antecedents of blood donation requires consideration of the multidimensional nature of altruistic motives . This will beneﬁt not just in terms of measurement but also the interpretation of motives and how they are linked to interventions . For example , Farrugia et al . [ 33 ] suggest that nine of the American Red Cross’s ‘Top 10 Reasons to Donate Blood’ focus on benevolence ( impure altruism ) . However , items such as ‘you will get free juice and cookies’ and ‘you will be someone’s hero’ may represent hedonistic and reputation building motives rather than benevolence . Furthermore , increasing the correspondence between the motive advocated by recruitment campaigns and the primary motive of the target audience is important to increase the effectiveness of recruitment campaigns [ 10 ] . This clearly emphasizes why it is important to understand and differentiate motivations / processes underlying altru - ism to ensure that the appropriate motivation is being tar - geted . The multiitem index developed here provides a reliable and valid measurement tool to support such work . Caveats The primary limitation of this study is a convenience sampling of university students , which means that the ﬁndings cannot be generalized to the wider population [ 18 ] . However , the theory - driven nature of these altruistic motivations and their overlap and correspondence with motives reported in both qualitative [ 14 , 34 ] and quanti - tative work [ 12 , 16 ] with blood donors suggests that these ﬁve altruistic motives should have generality for blood donation . A second limitation concerns the cross - sectional nature of the data pertaining to motivations , blood donor status and intentions . This precludes any statement about cau - sality [ 35 ] . However , the study was designed to be descriptive and explore structure and initial psychometric properties of blood donors’ altruistic motives . We feel that this aim is achieved .
