Knockdown of Five Genes Encoding Uncharacterized Proteins Inhibits Entamoeba histolytica Phagocytosis of Dead Host Cells Adam Sateriale , a , b Peter Miller , a Christopher D . Huston a , b Department of Medicine a and Cellular , Molecular , and Biomedical Sciences Program , b University of Vermont College of Medicine , Burlington , Vermont , USA Entamoeba histolytica is the protozoan parasite that causes invasive amebiasis , which is endemic to many developing countries and characterized by dysentery and liver abscesses . The virulence of E . histolytica correlates with the degree of host cell engulf - ment , or phagocytosis , and E . histolytica phagocytosis alters amebic gene expression in a feed - forward manner that results in an increased phagocytic ability . Here , we used a streamlined RNA interference screen to silence the expression of 15 genes whose expression was upregulated in phagocytic E . histolytica trophozoites to determine whether these genes actually function in the phagocytic process . When ﬁve of these genes were silenced , amebic strains with signiﬁcant decreases in the ability to phagocytose apoptotic host cells were produced . Phagocytosis of live host cells , however , was largely unchanged , and the defects were surpris - ingly speciﬁc for phagocytosis . Two of the ﬁve encoded proteins , which we named E . histolytica ILWEQ ( EhILWEQ ) and E . his - tolytica BAR ( EhBAR ) , were chosen for localization via SNAP tag labeling and localized to the site of partially formed phago - somes . Therefore , both EhILWEQ and EhBAR appear to contribute to E . histolytica virulence through their function in phagocytosis , and the large proportion ( 5 / 15 [ 33 % ] ) of gene - silenced strains with a reduced ability to phagocytose host cells vali - dates the previously published microarray data set demonstrating feed - forward control of E . histolytica phagocytosis . Finally , although only limited conclusions can be drawn from studies using the virulence - deﬁcient G3 Entamoeba strain , the relative speciﬁcity of the defects induced for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells but not healthy cells suggests that cell killing may play a rate - limiting role in the process of Entamoeba histolytica host cell engulfment . E ntamoeba histolytica infection , which causes dysentery and ame - bic liver abscesses , is an enormous public health problem in de - veloping countries ( 1 , 2 ) . In areas where the infection is highly en - demic , such as the Mirpur region of Dhaka , Bangladesh , over 50 % of children may become infected by 5 years of age ( 3 ) , yet only about 10 % ofallinfectionsbecomesymptomatic ( 4 , 5 ) . Isolatedstrainsof E . histolytica have been shown to have different levels of virulence both invivo and invitro ( 6 – 8 ) , whichmayinpartdeterminewhetherornot a particular infection becomes invasive . Multiple mechanisms contribute to the ability of E . histolytica to destroy the host intestinal mucosa and cause disease ( 9 ) . Following excystation within the small intestinal lumen , trophozoites attach to host mucous and epithelial cells in the colon , largely through the multisubunit amebic GalNAc lectin ( 10 , 11 ) . Trophozoites also se - crete multiple cysteine proteases , which degrade mucin and the ex - tracellular matrix ( 12 – 14 ) , and they kill resident host cells through a contact - dependent process that remains poorly understood ( 15 – 17 ) . Host cells appear to suffer from a disruption of the cell membrane with rapid changes in intracellular calcium levels ( 18 ) . This leads to changes in the host cell that closely resemble apoptosis with mem - brane blebbing , DNA digestion , and activation of caspase 3 ( 17 , 19 , 20 ) . Finally , E . histolytica trophozoites phagocytose red blood cells and nucleated host cells , and the ability to phagocytose host cells is strongly associated with virulence ( 21 – 23 ) . Two forms of amebic phagocytosis have been described : a fast variant in which entire cells are taken up intact and a slow variant in which target cells are progressively deformed and torn apart , followed by ingestion of cell fragments ( 24 , 25 ) . In vitro , most intact engulfed cells are apoptotic ( 26 ) , suggesting that host cell apoptosis facilitates what was previously termed fast amebic phagocytosis . Similarly , intact ingested apoptotic cells and eryth - rocytes are readily observed in vivo ( 26 – 28 ) . This process is par - tially mediated by exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of dying nucleated cells and erythrocytes ( 26 , 29 ) . It is also stim - ulated by host C1q , which binds to the surface of apoptotic cells and to amebic cell surface calreticulin ( 30 , 31 ) . On the other hand , it is now clear that slow amebic phagocytosis corresponds to the phenomenonrecentlytermedtrogocytosis , aprocessthatcontrib - utes to cell killing , during which E . histolytica bites off and engulfs pieces of viable cells ( 32 ) . By modeling of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells through inges - tion of C1q - coated particles , our laboratory previously showed that E . histolytica trophozoites have a program of gene expression changes that is initiated through the act of phagocytosis and that actually increases their phagocytic ability ( 33 ) . Stimulation with host cells also enhances trogocytosis ( 32 ) , likely through the same changes in gene expression .

Silencing of 5 of 15 genes signiﬁcantly de - creased the ability of E . histolytica to phagocytose apoptotic host cells . Two of these ﬁve genes were labeled with a SNAP tag to allow localization . Both proteins localized to the site of host cell phago - cytosis and also to extending pseudopodia . MATERIALS AND METHODS Gene silencing . Selected E . histolytica genes were cloned into the pCR8 / GW / TOPO entry vector ( Invitrogen ) and then shuttled into a custom Gateway destination vector version of the silencing plasmid , psAP - 2 ( 34 ) . This vector was created by inserting a Gateway destination cas - sette into the existing multiple - restriction site of psAP - 2 ( Invitrogen ) ( shown in Fig . S1 in the supplemental material ) . All primers used for the cloning of vector constructs can be found in Supplemental Infor - mation S1 in the supplemental material . G3 strain trophozoites were harvested during mid - log growth and transfected with a silencing plas - mid using the Attractene transfection reagent ( Qiagen ) and M199S medium ( M199 medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES , 5 . 7 mM cysteine , and 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin ) according to a protocol adapted from that of Petri and colleagues ( 35 ) . Transfected amoebae were then selected with G418 ( Sigma ) over a 3 - week period , starting with 1 . 5 (cid:2) g / ml and ending with 24 (cid:2) g / ml . Silencing was assessed in these strains using quantitative reverse transcription - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) . All primers for qRT - PCR can be found in Supplemental Infor - mation S1 in the supplemental material . Once gene silencing was con - ﬁrmed , the G418 selection was removed , and then silencing was again conﬁrmed and quantiﬁed prior to phenotypic assays . Cell monolayer adherence assay . CHO cells were grown to conﬂu - ence over a 48 - h period in 24 - well plates . Cell monolayers were washed three times with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ; ﬁxed with 4 % parafor - maldehyde , which was quenched with 250 mM glycine ; and then washed twice with PBS . Amoebae were incubated on ice for 15 min and resus - pended at 2 . 5 (cid:3) 10 5 cells per ml in M199S medium , 1 ml of which was applied to the cell monolayer in each well . The plates were then incubated for 30 min at 37°C . Nonadherent amoebae were washed away with 1 ml of coldPBS ( twice ) , andthenadherentamoebaewereﬁxedtothecellmono - layer with 4 % paraformaldehyde . This reaction was quenched with 250 mM glycine , and each well was washed twice with PBS . Amoebae were then labeled using an anti - serine - rich E . histolytica protein ( anti - SREHP ; clone 10D11 ) mouse monoclonal antibody ( originally described by Teix - eira and Huston [ 36 ] ) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - mouse IgG ( Molec - ular Probes ) . The plates were imaged using a Nikon eTi - 2000 microscope with a programmable , motorized stage . Twenty images per well were taken at a magniﬁcation of (cid:3) 200 , and the motorized stage was pro - grammed to randomly chose images from within the central 60 % of each well . Adherent cells were then quantiﬁed by batch processing using NIH ImageJ software as follows : the images were converted to 8 bits , thresh - olded , and binarized , and a watershedding algorithm was used to separate individual objects . Automated counts were then obtained by using size exclusion ( see Fig . S2 in the supplemental material ) . Cellsuspensionadherenceassay . AdherencetoJurkatTlymphocytes was measured using a modiﬁed version of a previously described assay ( 10 ) . G3 trophozoites in which genes were silenced were incubated on ice for 15 min and then washed twice with M199S medium and resuspended at 10 5 amoebae per ml in M199S medium . Jurkat T lymphocytes were grown to conﬂuence in T - 25 ﬂasks ( Corning ) and then washed twice with M199S medium and resuspended at 2 (cid:3) 10 6 cells per ml in M199S me - dium . Amoebae ( 10 4 ) were added to 2 (cid:3) 10 5 Jurkat T lymphocytes in sterile borosilicate glass culture tubes ( Fisher ) . Each sample was centri - fuged at 900 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and then incubated on ice for 60 min to allow adherence to target cells . Following another centrifugation at 900 rpm for 5 min at 4°C , samples were vortexed brieﬂy and the cells were quantiﬁed using a hemocytometer . Trophozoites with three or more ad - herent Jurkat T lymphocytes were counted as adherent . Results represent combined data from six biological replicates performed . Cytotoxicity assay . 2 = , 7 = - Bis - ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) - 5 ( and - 6 ) - carboxy - ﬂuorescein ( BCECF ) release from Jurkat T lymphocytes was used to mea - sure E . histolytica cytotoxicity using a protocol derived from that of Bern - inghausen and Leippe ( 37 ) . Jurkat T lymphocytes were labeled using 10 (cid:2) M BCECF acetoxymethyl ester ( Calbiochem ) in PBS for 20 min at 37°C . The cells were then washed three times with PBS and resus - pended at 3 (cid:3) 10 6 cells per ml in PBS . Amoebae were incubated on ice for 15 min , washed once with PBS , and then resuspended at 3 (cid:3) 10 5 cells per ml in PBS . Next , 3 (cid:3) 10 5 Jurkat T lymphocytes were moved into a polypropylene tube ( 12 by 75 mm ) with 3 (cid:3) 10 4 amoebae . Samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 150 (cid:3) g and then incubated for 30 min at 37°C . The supernatant was collected following centrifuga - tion at 400 (cid:3) g for 10 min , and ﬂuorescence was measured using a BioTek PowerWave XS plate reader . Background ﬂuorescence was de - termined using a lymphocyte - only control , complete lysis was deter - mined using cells lysed with sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , and per - cent speciﬁc lysis ( cytotoxicity ) was calculated according to the following formula : percent cytotoxicity (cid:4) [ ( ﬂuorescence experimental (cid:5) ﬂuorescence spontaneous ) / ( ﬂuorescence detergent lysed (cid:5) ﬂuorescence spontaneous ) ] (cid:3) 100 , where ﬂuorescence experimental is the experimental ﬂuorescence , ﬂuorescence spontaneous is the spontaneous ﬂuorescence , and ﬂuorescence detergent lysed is the ﬂuorescence of detergent - lysed cells . Re - sults represent combined data from six biological replicates . Apoptotic phagocytosis assay . Phagocytosis assays were performed using ﬂow cytometry as previously described ( 26 ) . Jurkat T lymphocytes were ﬁrst exposed to UV light ( using a Fotodyne UV box ) for 15 min to induceapoptosis . ImmediatelyfollowingUVexposure , cellswereﬂuores - cently labeled by resuspension in 2 ml of 28 (cid:2) M carboxyﬂuorescein suc - cinimidyl ester ( Sigma ) in PBS . Labeling proceeded for 15 min at 37°C , at which time 2 ml of fetal bovine serum was added to quench the labeling reaction . Jurkat cells were resuspended in 35 ml of RPMI medium and incubatedat37°Cfor4htoallowapoptoticmaturation .

Live phagocytosis assays were performed in the same manner as the apoptotic phagocytosis assay , but without UV exposure and incubation of amoebae and Jurkat T lymphocytes for 25 min at 37°C . Results represent combined data from six biological replicates . SNAP vector construction . E . histolytica ILWEQ ( EhILWEQ ; EHI _ 003930 ) and E . histolytica BAR ( EhBAR ; EHI _ 105240 ) were cloned ( see Supplemental Information S1 in the supplemental material for PCR primers ) into the E . histolytica SNAP ( EhSNAP ) vector ( shown in Fig . S1 in the supplemental material ) for expression as fusion proteins with an N - terminal SNAP tag .

E . histolytica trophozoites were grown in 15 - ml glass tubes with trypsin yeast extract - iron - sulfur - 33 ( TYI - S - 33 ) medium and induced with 1 mg / ml tetracycline ( Sigma ) for 24 h prior to addition of SNAP substrate . Six hours prior to use , 100 , 000 trophozoites were moved into a 2 - ml glass tube and SNAP - Cell TMR - Star substrate ( New England BioLabs ) was added directly to the medium at 500 nM . Thirty minutes prior to use , this medium was replaced with fresh TYI - S - 33 medium . Amoebae were then resuspended in M199S medium and ap - plied to a 35 - mm glass - bottom dish ( Mattek ) containing a conﬂuent mono - layer of human ileocecal carcinoma cells ( HCT - 8 cells ; courtesy of ATCC ) stained with Hoechst 33342 ( Sigma ) .

All ﬁgures were prepared using the Adobe Illustrator ( version 10 . 0 . 3 ) program . RESULTS Large - scale silencing of E . histolytica genes found to be upregu - lated in phagocytic trophozoites . Nineteen genes that were pre - viously found to be overexpressed in phagocytic trophozoites were chosen for silencing to determine which ones , if any , had a measurable impact on phagocytosis . Using a custom Gateway vec - tor system based on the psAP - 2 vector ( 34 ) , silencing vectors for all 19 genes were cloned and used to transfect G3 trophozoites . AmoebaDB gene identiﬁers and the outcomes of gene silencing and preliminary phagocytosis assays for these 19 genes are sum - marized in Table S1 in the supplemental material . Three transfec - tants were repeatedly not viable , and one gene was not sufﬁciently silencedtoenablefurthercharacterizationonthebasisoftheqRT - PCR results . Of the strains transfected with a plasmid designed to silence 1 of the remaining 15 genes , 6 were identiﬁed to have altered phenotypes , on the basis of the preliminary phagocytosis and adherence phenotypic screens . Table 1 shows the decrease in mRNA expression for each of these six strains compared to the level of mRNA expression for empty vector - transfected amoebae . The reduction in gene expression determined using the Gateway silencing vector ranged from 4 - to 20 - fold . While this degree of gene silencing is adequate for phenotypic characterization , it should be noted that silencing with this plasmid was less robust than it was in prior studies and our own experience using the psAP - 2 Gunma vector ( 34 , 40 , 41 ) . This may be due to the addi - tion of att recombination sites ( each approximately 124 nucleo - tides in length ) , which are necessary for Gateway recombination , on either side of the target sequence ( 42 ) . Phagocytosis of live and apoptotic host cells . Entamoeba his - tolytica phagocytoses apoptotic cells more rapidly than healthy cells ( 26 ) . Thus , to facilitate the comparison of results using apop - totic versus healthy target cells , assay conditions were established to achieve a comparable phagocytic index for engulfment of each during the allotted incubation time . When assayed for the ability to phagocytose apoptotic Jurkat T lymphocytes , ﬁve of the six strains showed a clear and statistically signiﬁcant decrease ( Fig . 1A ) . The reduction in the uptake of apoptotic lymphocytes ranged from roughly 25 % ( in the strain in which EHI _ 098510 was si - lenced ) to 50 % ( in the strain in which EHI _ 150430 was silenced ) in E . histolytica gene - silencedtrophozoites , asdeterminedbymea - surement of the uptake of ﬂuorescently labeled host cells during 10 min of incubation . In contrast , the same gene - silenced strains showed less of a decrease in uptake when assayed for phagocytosis of live Jurkat T lymphocytes ( Fig . 1B ) . Although trophozoites were allowed to phagocytose live lymphocytes for 25 min , which is longer than the amount of time that they were allowed to phago - cytose apoptotic lymphocytes , the phagocytic index for the live lymphocytes was decreased with statistical signiﬁcance for only two strains in which genes were silenced by RNA interference ( the strains in which EHI _ 003930 and EHI _ 105240 were silenced ) . Adherence and cytotoxicity assays . The method by which host cells are killed and phagocytosed by E . histolytica may follow a sequential process of adherence , cell killing , and phagocytosis ( reviewed in reference 9 ) ( 15 , 26 , 29 , 43 ) . In order to characterize our silenced E . histolytica strains more fully , therefore , we also tested for defects in adherence and cytotoxicity using previously established methods . Strains of trophozoites in which genes were silenced were assayed for the ability to adhere to a monolayer of cells ( Fig . 2A ) , for the ability to adhere to host cells in suspen - sion ( Fig . 2B ) , and for a cytotoxic effect on labeled Jurkat T lymphocytes ( see Fig . S4 in the supplemental material ) . Two strains of trophozoites , amoebae in which either EHI _ 003930 or EHI _ 189500 was silenced , showed an increase in monolayer adherence compared to that for trophozoites transfected with the TABLE 1 Reduction in gene expression measured by qRT - PCR AmoebaDB gene identiﬁer AmoebaDB product name (cid:6)(cid:6) C Ta Mean fold change in expression c Biological replicates b Mean (cid:6)(cid:6) C T SD (cid:6)(cid:6) C T EHI _ 003930 I / LWEQ domain protein 4 . 396 , 4 . 288 4 . 342 0 . 076 (cid:5) 20 . 28 EHI _ 007640 Hypothetical protein 4 . 349 , 4 . 099 4 . 224 0 . 177 (cid:5) 18 . 68 EHI _ 098510 Hypothetical protein 2 . 575 , 3 . 510 3 . 042 0 . 662 (cid:5) 8 . 24 EHI _ 105240 BAR / SH3 domain - containing protein 2 . 540 , 1 . 603 2 . 071 0 . 663 (cid:5) 4 . 20 EHI _ 150430 Villidin , putative 3 . 107 , 3 . 113 3 . 110 0 . 004 (cid:5) 8 . 64 EHI _ 189500 Calponin homology domain protein , putative 4 . 854 , 3 . 536 4 . 195 0 . 932 (cid:5) 18 . 32 a C T , threshold cycle . b Results are from two biological replicates of E . histolytica G3 trophozoites in which the indicated gene was silenced .

The former strain also showed increased adherence to host cells in suspension . Regarding cytotoxicity , it should be noted that the G3 E . histolytica strain used to facilitate silencing of the expression of numerous genes does not express the genes for amoebapores A and B , which are believed to be involved in host cell killing ( 44 ) . Despite this limitation , approximately 17 % of cells were killed by G3 strain trophozoites transfected with the empty vec - tor control , as deﬁned by the detection of cell membrane disruption by vital dye release . None of the tested strains in which genes were silenced had a further decrease in cytotoxic ability . Fluorescent microscopy . We selected EHI _ 003930 and EHI _ 105240 for the localization of their products , because si - lencing of these two E . histolytica genes produced the largest re - ductions in phagocytosis and sequence analysis of each indicated the presence of well - conserved protein domains with plausible roles in adherence and / or the control of membrane dynamics . We assigned names on the basis of their predicted domains ( Fig . 3 ; see also Table S3 in the supplemental material for domain E values ) and ﬂuorescently labeled them to determine the cellular location of their protein products . EhILWEQ ( EHI _ 003930 ) and EhBAR ( EHI _ 105240 ) were both cloned into an E . histolytica - speciﬁc SNAP tag expression vector , which expresses each as a fusion with a codon - optimized SNAP protein ( 39 ) . Trophozoites were then ﬂuorescently labeled using a cell - permeant O 6 - benzylguanine - de - rivative SNAP protein substrate , which irreversibly binds to the SNAP protein . To model parasite infection , labeled trophozoites were applied to a conﬂuent monolayer of human ileocecal carci - nomacells . Trophozoitesproceededtoattackthecellmonolayerand phagocytose the host cells . In contrast to a recent report that E . his - tolytica rejects cell corpses that it has killed ( 32 ) , we observed both slow and fast phagocytosis under these conditions , with engulfment of cell pieces ( i . e . , trogocytosis ) and frequent engulfment of appar - ently intact cells ( see Movie S1 in the supplemental material ) . Both EhILWEQ and EhBAR localized to the majority of par - tially formed phagosomes ( Fig . 4 , yellow arrows ) ( 6 / 6 and 10 / 12 observed events , respectively ) but were typically not enriched in areas surrounding fully formed phagosomes ( 1 / 13 and 1 / 36 ob - served events , respectively ) .

DISCUSSION In this study , we used a moderate - throughput gene silencing method in combination with a battery of phenotypic assays to identify E . histolytica genes encoding proteins that function in amebic phagocytosis . A speciﬁc role for EhBAR and EhILWEQ during early stages of phagocytosis is implied by the localization of each to the early phagosome but not fully formed phagosomes , as well as by signiﬁcant reductions in amebic phagocytosis following gene silencing . On the other hand , silencing of expression of either EhBAR or EhILWEQ did not affect amebic cytotoxicity .

The genes selected for silencing were not randomly chosen from among those previously shown to be expressed at higher levels in phagocytic cells but , rather , were handpicked on the basis of functional annotation via the use of the NIH DAVID bioinfor - maticsresourceandthepredictionofhomologousdomainsbytheuseofPfam ( 45 , 46 ) . Three of the genes chosen for silencing pro - duced nonviable E . histolytica strains following two attempts at transfection , and it should be noted that these genes might be essential for E . histolytica survival . The six genes that resulted in viable strains after they were silenced and whose silencing showed a signiﬁcant effect on the phenotype during preliminary screens are described below ( Fig . 3 and Table 2 ) . EhBAR ( EHI _ 105240 ) is predicted to have both an N - terminal Bin - amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) domain and a C - terminal src ho - mology 3 ( SH3 ) domain . BAR - domain proteins are highly con - served among eukaryotes ( Pfam family BAR , Pfam accession no . PF03114 ] ) . Proteins with N - terminal amphipathic helical BAR ( N - BAR ) domains are thought to function as dimers , binding to - gether to both drive and sense membrane curvature . N - BAR - con - taining proteins , such as the endophilins and the amphiphysins , function in endocytosis ( 47 , 48 ) . The human N - BAR - containing Bin2 protein was recently shown to affect motility , adhesion , and phagocytosis in leukocytes ( 49 ) . SH3 domains have been shown to bind proline residues and are commonly found in proteins in - volved in tyrosine kinase signaling ( 50 ) . E . histolytica contains 55 putative tyrosine kinases , 44 of which are putative receptor ty - rosine kinases ( 51 ) . In our earlier microarray analysis comparing gene regulation between phagocytic and nonphagocytic popula - tions of E . histolytica trophozoites , the SH3 domain was found to be enriched in genes upregulated in phagocytic trophozoites ( 33 ) . EhILWEQ ( EHI _ 003930 ) is predicted to have both I / LWEQ and ANTH domains . On the basis of a TBLASTN search of the translated NCBI nonredundant nucleotide database , proteins with high degrees of homology and the same domain structure are present in other Entamoeba and Dictyostelium species and numer - ous fungi . The I / LWEQ domain is conserved in proteins from single - celled eukaryotes to mammals and is capable of binding F actin invivo . Itiscommonlyfoundinthetalinfamilyofeukaryotic proteins that function in cell adhesion ( 52 ) . The ANTH domain is known to bind the cell membrane and is commonly found in proteins that function in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 53 ) . Al - though microscopic evidence shows that EhILWEQ localizes to the site of phagocytosis and shows no pattern of vesicular labeling ( Fig . 4 ) , we cannot rule out the possibility that EhILWEQ func - tions in trafﬁcking of proteins within trophozoites . EHI _ 150430 is a recently classiﬁed homolog of the Dictyoste - lium discoideum ﬂightless - like 1 protein ( FLIL1 ) ( 54 ) . The puta - tive protein contains seven gelsolin domains , a leucine - rich repeat domain , and a villidin headpiece domain . While the overall pro - tein structure and arrangement of the domains is variable , villidin proteins are ubiquitous among eukaryotes ranging from single - celled organisms to humans . Gelsolin homology domains are found exclusively in actin binding proteins , so it appears that EHI _ 150430 also plays a role in cytoskeleton organization . Our gene silencing screen also identiﬁed two hypothetical pro - teins , EHI _ 007640 and EHI _ 098510 , that are potentially involved in phagocytosis . The former , EHI _ 007640 , is highly conserved and has homologous C2 , pleckstrin , LIM , and calponin domains . C2 domains function in targeting proteins to the cell membrane and bind intracellular calcium , a second messenger shown to be critical in Entamoeba virulence and phagocytosis ( 55 – 58 ) . The pleckstrin homology domain is understood to function in phos - phoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3 kinase ) signaling through binding of phosphatidylinositol lipids ( 59 ) . Ghosh and Samuelson showed that treatment of E . histolytica with wortmannin , a fungal inhibi - tor of PI3 kinase , inhibited the phagocytosis of bacteria , red blood cells , and mucin - coated beads , strongly implicating PI3 kinase signaling in E . histolytica phagocytosis ( 60 ) . In addition , Nakada - Tsukui et al . ( 61 ) and Byekova et al . ( 62 ) have demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate , a PI3 kinase product , is present in phagosomal cups . LIM domains , which are ubiquitous in eukaryotes , consist of two zinc ﬁnger motifs separated by a short linker ( 63 ) . The E . histolytica protein LimA ( EhLimA ) has been shown to localize to the plasma membrane and bind actin via its LIM domain ( 64 ) . The calponin homology domain is also re - ported to bind F actin and microtubules ( 65 ) . The other hypothet - ical protein , EHI _ 098510 , appears to be speciﬁc to Entamoeba species and has no signiﬁcant homologous domains . However , it is the only gene with a predicted signal peptide and a transmem - brane domain that was silenced ( predicted via the SignalP and TMHMM programs , respectively ) ( 66 ) . EHI _ 098510 was identi - ﬁed within E . histolytica phagosomes in two prior proteomics studies ( 67 , 68 ) . EHI _ 189500 encodes a calponin homology domain containing a protein that is speciﬁc to Entamoeba species . This protein has a domain with weak homology to the aforementioned calponin do - main . Silencing of EHI _ 189500 resulted in a strain of trophozoites with an increase in host cell adhesion but no detectable change in host cell engulfment . One caveat of the microscopy studies demonstrating the local - ization of EhBAR and EhILWEQ to early phagosomes is that each protein was localized by expressing a SNAP - tagged protein using an episomal system . It is therefore conceivable that either the SNAP tag or protein overexpression caused aberrant protein lo - calization . When these data are considered in the context of the effect of gene silencing on the phenotype ( i . e . , reduced phagocy - TABLE 2 Summary of phenotypes resulting from silencing of expression of each E . histolytica gene AmoebaDBidentiﬁer Phenotype a Phagocytosis Adherence Cytotoxicity Apoptoticcells Livecells Cellmonolayer Cellsuspension EHI _ 003930 (cid:2) (cid:2) Œ — — EHI _ 007640 (cid:2) — — — — EHI _ 098510 (cid:2) — — — — EHI _ 105240 (cid:2) (cid:2) — — — EHI _ 150430 (cid:2) — — — — EHI _ 189500 — — Œ — — a (cid:2) , downregulation ; Œ , upregulation ; — , no change in phenotype .

Although none of the silenced strains chosen for phenotypic characterization displayed a signiﬁcant change in cytotoxicity , these results must also be interpreted with caution . The G3 strain of trophozoites used for silencing was originally described by Bra - cha et al . to be a unique strain of E . histolytica HM - 1 : IMSS capable of gene silencing through a then - unknown mechanism ( 34 , 69 ) . Zhang et al . then demonstrated that G3 trophozoites silence gene expression through both chromatin remodeling and activation of an RNA - induced transcriptional silencing complex ( 70 ) . This method has proven invaluable for E . histolytica research , yet the G3 strain differs from the original HM - 1 : IMSS strain in that amoebapore proteins , small amphipathic proteins that form holes in target host cell membranes , are permanently silenced in the G3 strain . Speciﬁcally , amoebapores A and B are silenced , but amoe - bapore C is not . As a result , the G3 strain has decreased cytotox - icity compared to that of the HM - 1 : IMSS strain of E . histolytica , and therefore , any decrease in cytotoxicity would be in addition to the previous reduction ( 34 ) . Nevertheless , G3 strain trophozoites retain some cytotoxic ability . In the current study , incubation of controlG3straintrophozoiteswithvitaldye - labeledJurkatTlym - phocytes resulted in the speciﬁc release of approximately 17 % of the total ﬂuorescent signal after 30 min ( see Fig . S4 in the supple - mental material ) . This dye release reﬂects the cell membrane dis - ruption that presumably occurs via an amoebapore - independent mechanism and may be due to the process of trogocytosis , during which host cell pieces are torn off and engulfed ( 32 ) . Given that each system has limitations , the G3 strain proved invaluable when it was coupled with the custom Gateway silencing vector , which allowed us to silence many candidate genes over a short period of time . Interestingly , we did not see the same decrease in phagocytosis rates when the uptake of live cells was compared to that of apop - totic host cells . If cell killing is to be considered a sequential pro - cess , then an assay of live cell phagocytosis measures the rate of cell adherence , cell killing , and initiation of phagocytosis and then the rate of cell engulfment via a common ﬁnal pathway . In our in vitro assay , to induce contact , Jurkat T lymphocytes were centrifuged with E . histolytica , which facilitates adherence by putting cells in close proximity . Therefore , our in vitro assay of live cell phagocy - tosis measures the rate of cell killing , initiation of phagocytosis , and engulfment . In contrast , our assay of apoptotic phagocytosis measures only the rate of initiation of phagocytosis and engulf - ment . If the rate of cell killing is low compared to the rate of phagocytosis , cell killing may act as the rate - limiting step in the process of host cell killing and phagocytosis . Under these condi - tions , trogocytosis , which was previously described to be slow E . histolytica phagocytosis but which is essentially a mechanism of cell killing , likely predominates . On the other hand , previous work has shown that phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer cell membrane ( a signal of host cell death ) stimulates the phagocytosis of Jurkat T lymphocytes and host erythrocytes , and under these conditions , largely intact cells are rapidly engulfed ( 26 , 29 ) . Had initiation of phagocytosis been the rate - limiting step , one would expect that phosphatidylserine exposure would not affect the rate of lymphocyte or erythrocyte uptake . In the context of this previ - ous work , we believe that our results concerning live and apop - totic host cell phagocytosis support cell killing as the rate - limiting step in the process of E . histolytica cell killing and phagocytosis ( 26 , 29 ) . Finally , our results highlight the redundancy in the E . histo - lytica phagocytic machinery , since not one of the ﬁve strains in which genes were silenced and which showed defects in phagocy - tosis showed a complete lack of phagocytosis . Trophozoites in which EHI _ 150430 was silenced had the greatest defect at a 50 % phagocytic index compared to that for the empty vector - trans - fected control . Despite this redundancy , said pathways appear to share a program of feed - forward regulation in response to phago - cytosis , in which phagocytosis stimulates the expression of genes that enhance the phagocytic ability ( 33 ) .
