The organization of the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in cell physiology in motile and non - motile organisms . Nonetheless , the function of the actin based motor molecules , members of the myosin super - family , is not well understood . Deletion of MY03 , a yeast gene encoding a " classic " myosin I , has no detect - able phenotype . We used a synthetic lethality screen to uncover genes whose functions might overlap with those of MY03 and identified a second yeast myosin I gene , MY05 . MY05 shows 86 and 62 % identity to MY03 across the motor and non - motor regions . Both genes contain an amino terminal motor domain , a neck region containing two IQ motifs , and a tail domain con - sisting of a positively charged region , a proline - rich re - gion containing sequences implicated in ATP - insensi - tive actin binding , and an SH3 domain . Although myo5 deletion mutants have no detectable phenotype , yeast strains deleted for both MY03 and MY05 have severe defects in growth and actin cytoskeletal organization . Double deletion mutants also display phenotypes asso - ciated with actin disorganization including accumula - tion of intracellular membranes and vesicles , cell rounding , random bud site selection , sensitivity to high osmotic strength , and low pH as well as defects in chitin and cell wall deposition , invertase secretion , and fluid phase endocytosis . Indirect immunofluorescence stud - ies using epitope - tagged Myo5p indicate that Myo5p is localized at actin patches . These results indicate that MY03 and MY05 encode classical myosin I proteins with overlapping functions and suggest a role for Myo3p and Myo5p in organization of the actin cyto - skeleton of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . T HE myosin superfamily of molecular motors encom - passes at least eleven different classes of proteins ( Cheney et al . , 1993 ; Sellers and Goodson , 1995 ) . While the conventional myosin ( myosin II ) has been stud - ied in great detail in both muscle and nonmuscle cells , comparatively little is known about most unconventional myosin proteins . Myosin I proteins were the first uncon - ventional myosins discovered ( Pollard and Korn , 1973 ; Hammer et al . , 1986 ) . Members of the myosin I class have now been identified in phylogenetically diverse organisms ( for review see Sellers and Goodson , 1995 ) , suggesting that they are ubiquitous , ancient proteins with a central role in eukaryotic cell biology . Myosin I proteins can be divided into at least two sub - classes based on homologies in motor and tail domains ( Hasson and Mooseker , 1995 ) .

These pro - teins possess tail domains containing a positively charged region implicated in membrane binding , a proline - rich re - gion , and an SH3 domain ( for review , see Hammer , 1991 ) . The proline - rich region contains sequences implicated in ATP - insensitive actin binding ( Lynch et al . , 1986 ; Dober - stein and Pollard , 1992 ; Jung and Hammer , 1994 ; Rosen - feld and Rener , 1994 ) . Between the motor and tail do - mains is a " neck " region containing one or two " IQ " motifs , sequences expected to bind to calmodulin or calmodulin - related myosin light chains ( Cheney and Mooseker , 1992 ) . In contrast , the brush border myosin I ' s and related pro - teins have tails with only the putative membrane binding region and necks with 3 - 6 IQ motifs . Proteins clearly re - lated to the brush border myosins have been found only in metazoans , although similar proteins exist in ameboid cells ( reviewed by Sellers and Goodson , 1995 ) . The function of myosin I proteins is not well under - stood . One model proposes that myosin I proteins bind to both microfilaments and organelles and use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive organelle movement along actin tracks ( Adams and Pollard , 1989 ) . Alternatively , myosin I proteins could act to connect the plasma membrane to the © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 96 / 06 / 1277 / 15 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , Number 6 , June 1996 1277 - 1291 1277 actin cytoskeleton and drive movements of the cytoskeleton against the membrane . A classic myosin - I - specific vari - ation of this model proposes that the second , ATP - insensi - tive , actin - binding site in the tail could be used to cross - link actin filaments and allow myosin - I to drive F - actin sliding on actin filaments , thus altering actin organization at the membrane interface . Experimental observations obtained thus far are consis - tent with all of these proposed functions . In Dictyostelium , myosin I proteins have been implicated in cell motility , pha - gocytosis , and pseudopod formation ( Jung and Hammer , 1990 ; Wessels et al . , 1991 ; Jung et al . , 1993 ; Titus et al . , 1993 ) . Syringe loading of inhibitory antibodies indicates that one myosin I protein , Acanthamoeba IC , is essential for the function of the Acanthamoeba contractile vacuole ( Doberstein et al . , 1993 ) . Finally , recent studies in As - pergillus nidulans indicate that the MyoA gene encodes an essential myosin I required for secretion and polarized growth ( McGoldrick et al . , 1995 ) . Previous studies identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a gene that encodes a classic myosin I protein , MY03 . Dele - tion of this gene had no discernible phenotypic effects under laboratory conditions , presumably for reasons of func - tional redundancy ( Goodson and Spudich , 1995 ) . How - ever , deletion of MY03 in combination with mutations of other known yeast myosin genes ( MYO1 , a myosin II , MY02 , a myosin V , or MY04 , a myosin V ) has no detect - able effect ( Goodson and Spudich , 1995 ; Haarer et al . , 1994 ; Lillie , S . L . , and S . S . Brown , unpublished results ) . These findings indicate that the redundant protein is not one of the known yeast myosins . We used a genetic screen to identify mutations that create a requirement for MY03 . This strategy , termed a synthetic lethality screen , has been useful for identification of genes that are involved in a common process ( for example , see Bender and Pringle , 1991 ) . We present results of such a screen and demon - strate that it identifies a new yeast myosin I gene , MY05 . We demonstrate that yeast strains deleted for both MY03 and MY05 have a severe defect in growth , actin polariza - tion , and actin - dependent processes including secretion , endocytosis , and polarity establishment . We suggest that the primary defect in the mutants bearing classic myosin I deletions is abnormal polarization of the actin cytoskeleton . Materials and Methods Yeast And Bacterial Manipulations Yeast manipulations including cell culture , transformation , and tetrad analysis were carried out according to Guthrie and Fink ( 1991 ) . Bacterial manipulations were carried out according to Sambrook et al . ( 1989 ) . Synthetic Lethality Screen myo5 mutants were isolated using a synthetic lethal strategy based on se - lection against the URA3 gene . A yeast strain ( HA10 - 1c ) containing a de - letion of MY03 ( Table I ) was transformed with a centromere - based , pRS316 - derived plasmid ( P316SRMYO3 ) which contains the URA3 marker and the full coding region of MY03 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . Transformants were mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate ( EMS ) 1 until only ~ 25 % of the cells were viable ( Lawrence , 1991 ) . Transformants were replica plated to uracil - free plates and to plates containing 5 - fluoro - 1 . Abbreviations used in this paper : 5 - FOA , 5 - fluoroorotic acid ; EMS , eth - ylmethane sulfonate ; SH3 , Src Homology 3 . orotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) . Since 5 - FOA kills cells expressing the URA3 gene , this method distinguishes colonies that require the MYO3 - containing plasmid from those that do not . From 10 , 000 mutagenized colonies screened , ~ 120 grew poorly on unbuffered 5 - FOA containing media after incubation at 30°C . Three of these strains ( Cll , 37 , and D2 ) uniformly maintained the URA3 marker under nonselective conditions and were kept for further examination . Cloning and Sequence Analysis The MY05 gene was cloned by complementation of mutant 37 with a plasmid library . The library consisted of genomic yeast DNA partially di - gested with Sau3A and sub - cloned into a centromere - based , LEU2 - con - taining shuttle vector derived from YCP50 ( Christianson et al . , 1992 ; American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ; ATCC No . 77162 ) . Of ~ 12 , 000 Leu + transformants , 46 colonies were no longer dependent upon retention of p316SRMY03 ( the MYO3 - containing plasmid marked by URA3 ) as assayed by survival of these colonies at 30°C on solid , unbuff - ered minimal medium ( SD ) containing 5 - FOA . Library plasmids were iso - lated from 40 of these colonies ( Ward , 1990 ) . 29 contained the MY03 gene and 11 contained a different set of overlapping inserts which con - ferred 5 - FOA resistance to synthetic lethal mutants . The DNA sequence of this insert was determined as described previously ( Goodson and Spu - dich , 1995 ) . Sequence analysis of the region which conferred FOA resis - tance revealed a new myosin I gene , MY05 . Similar results were obtained by complementation of mutant Cll with the same library . Sequences were analyzed with the GCG Package ( Genetics Computer Group , Inc . , Madi - son , WI ) . Disruption of MY05 A strain of yeast missing all of the MY05 coding sequence ( as well as 95 bases of 5 ' noncoding sequence ) was created by a " delta deletion " ( Sikor - ski and Hieter , 1989 ) . 3 ' and 5 ' noncoding sequence of the MY05 locus were inserted into the integrating plasmid pRS304 in a direct orientation to create the plasmid p304KO3 ( see Fig . 1 ) . p31MKO3 was linearized with SpeI to cut between the 3 ' and 5 ' inserts and transformed into the diploid yeast strains CRY3 and HA20 . Southern blot analysis revealed that se - quences between the 5 ' and 3 ' inserts on one chromosome of the transfor - mant were replaced by the plasmid DNA . Haploid strains bearing the MY05 deletion were isolated by tetrad dissection . The Trp + phenotype marking the deletion segregated 2 : 2 in both the CRY3 and HA20 trans - formants and was tightly linked to growth defects in the HA20 transfor - mants ( data not shown ) . Construction of Epitope - tagged Myo5p MyoSp was epitope tagged by insertion of three copies of the 11 amino acid epitope from human c - myc ( Evan et al . , 1985 ) at the extreme COOH terminus of the protein . To do so , the stop codon of MY05 was replaced with a BamHI site using PCR . The 3 ' end of the modified MY05 gene was then excised using BamHI and BstEII . This product was ligated to a 4 . 8 - kb SpeI - BstEII fragment which consists of the remainder of the MY05 gene and 1 . 8 kb of its 5 ' noncoding region containing the MY05 promoter re - gion . The ligated products were digested with SpeI and BamHI , and sub - cloned into the KS Bluescript vector ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Three copies of the myc tag coding sequence were excised from the pKK - 1 plas - mid with BamHI and inserted in frame at the BamHI site at the 3 ' end of the MY05 gene . An NheI linker ( New England Biolabs Inc . , Beverly , MA ) containing a stop codon in all three reading frames was inserted im - mediately downstream from the myc tag . The entire construct was excised with SacI and XhoI and sub - cloned into the centromere - based yeast shut - tle vector , pRS - Y2 , a derivative of pRS316 which contains the multiple cloning site of pYES2 ( InVitrogen , San Diego , CA ) . This construct is re - ferred to as pRS - Y2 - myc - MY05 . A construct containing untagged MY05 and 1 . 8 kb of its 5 ' noncoding region ( pRS - Y2 - MY05 ) was produced us - ing a similar approach . Light Microscopy Actin cytoskeletal structure and chitin deposition were visualized using rhodamine - phalloidin , a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against yeast actin ( Druhin et al . , 1988 ) , and Calcofluor ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) according to published procedures ( Adams et al . , 1991 ; Pringle et al . 1991 ) . Cell viability was determined using the FUN - 1 cell stain ( Molecular The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , 1996 1278 Table I .

Other methods ( fixation , mounting , DAPI staining ) were as described by Pringle et al . ( 1991 ) . Photomicroscopy was performed on a Leitz Dialux micro - scope using a 100× ( NA 1 . 4 ) objective ( Rockleigh , NJ ) . Images were col - lected using a cooled CCD camera ( model # Star - l ; Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) . Light output from the 100W Mercury Arc lamp was controlled using a shutter driver ( model # Uniblitz D122 ; Vincent Associates , Rochester , NY ) and attenuated using neutral density filters ( Omega Optical Corpo - ration , Brattleboro , VT ) . Image enhancement and analysis were per - formed on a Macintosh Quadra 800 computer ( Cupertino , CA ) using the public domain program NIH Image 1 . 55 . Images were stored on a mag - netic optical disk drive ( Peripheral Land Inc . , Fremont , CA ) . Confocal images of cells were obtained with a laser scanning confocal microscope ( model # MRC 600 ; Bio - Rad Microscience , Cambridge , MA ) on a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope ( Oberkochen , Germany ) using a 63× ( NA 1 . 4 ) Zeiss Plan - Apo infinity corrected objective . The illumina - tion sources were the 488 - and 514 - nm lines from a 25 - mW argon laser . Rhodamine - phalloidin was visualized with a 514 - nm bandpass excitation filter , a 540 - nm dichroic mirror and a 550 - nm - long pass emission filter . Light was attenuated using neutral density filters in the excitation path . Each field of cells was sectioned three dimensionally by recording images from a series of 0 . 36 I ~ m optical sections . Movement from one focal plane to the next was achieved using a stepper motor attached to the fine focus control of the microscope . Each optical section collected was the average of 15 scans at the confocal microscope ' s normal scan rate ( 1 frame / s ) . All images were processed and enhanced using the COMOS program ( Bio - Rad Microscience , Cambridge , MA ) and Adobe Photoshop 2 . 5 ( Moun - tain View , CA ) . Electron Microscopy Preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopy was carried out according to Stevens ( 1977 ) . Yeast were fixed by addition of glutaral - dehyde ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) to growth medium to a final concentration of 5 % . After incubation for 3 h at room temperature , cells were concen - trated by centrifugation ( 10 , 000 g , 10 min , room temperature ) , and washed two times with 0 . 9 % NaC1 . Samples were resuspended in 4 % KMnO4 in 0 . 1 M Na - cacodylate , pH 7 . 4 ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Fort Wash - ington , PA ) , and incubated at 4°C for 1 h with gentle rotation . After two washes with 0 . 9 % NaCl , samples were resuspended in 2 % uranyl acetate ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) and incubated for 1 h at room tempera - ture . Samples were washed three times , dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions , infiltrated with propylene oxide for 10 min , and embed - ded in Epon - 812 ( Tousimis Research Co . , Rockville , MD ) . Ultrathin sec - tions were stained for 5 min with 1 % lead citrate before viewing with a JEOL 1200 transmission electron microscope . Invertase Secretion Assay Secreted invertase was assayed as described ( Goldstein and Lampen , 1975 ) in intact cells . Cells were grown to log phase in YEP media contain - ing 2 % glucose . Cultures were washed with YEP supplemented with 0 . 05 % glucose , resuspended in this media , and incubated at 30°C with constant shaking . At the times indicated , cell densities were determined by OD600 measurements , and aliquots were removed from the culture . Cells were washed with ice cold 10 mM NAN3 , resuspended in 10 mM NaN 3 , and stored on ice until all aliquots had been collected . A portion of each aliquot containing equal numbers of cells was added to 100 mM so - dium acetate , pH 5 . 1 , and 125 mM sucrose and incubated for 20 min at 37°C . Reactions were terminated by addition of 2 . 5 volumes 200 mM K2HPO4 and stored on ice . An aliquot from each terminated reaction was diluted with 4 volumes 200 mM K2HPO4 and boiled for 5 min to destroy invertase activity . The quantity of glucose in each sample was determined by addition of Glucostat reagent ( 100 mM KPi , pH 7 . 0 , 20 ~ Lg / ml glucose oxidase , 2 . 5 p . g / ml peroxidase , and 15 p ~ g / ml O - diaisidine ) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min . Color development was initiated by addition of one volume 6 M HC1 and measured using a spectrophotometer ( model DU - 50 ; Beckman Instruments , Fullerton , CA ) at 540 nm . Levels of glucose re - leased were calculated by comparing absorption readings to a standard curve . Units of invertase activity are defined as micromoles of glucose re - leased / min / 10 mg cell ( dry weight ) , assuming that 10D600 equals 0 . 19 mg cells / ml . Lucifer Yellow Uptake Assay The uptake of Lucifer yellow CH was performed according to Riezman ( 1985 ) with slight modifications . Cells were grown to log phase in YEP + 2 % glucose and Lucifer yellow CH ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) was added to 4 mg / ml . After 60 min incubation at 30°C with constant agitation , cells were washed three times with ice cold 50 mM succinate , pH 5 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , 20 mM NAN3 . An aliquot of each sample was embedded in 0 . 8 % low melt agarose on a glass slide and placed under a cover slip . Opti - cal images were collected using the Leitz Dialux microscope as described above . Cells were scored as positive if the vacuole was clearly stained with Lucifer yellow . Goodson et al . Myosin I Function in Yeast 1279 Results Synthetic Lethality Screen Identifies a New Yeast Myosin Gene , MY05 Yeast deleted for the classic myosin I gene MY03 have no discernible defects , suggesting that another protein ( s ) has overlapping function with Myo3p ( Goodson and Spudich , 1995 ) . We conducted a synthetic lethality screen to iden - tify such proteins . This genetic screen is based on the prin - ciple that yeast bearing mutations of either of two genes with overlapping function will remain viable . However , yeast mutated at both genes should have a defect in a basic bio - logical function and are expected to die ( Huffaker et al . , 1987 ) . Yeast carrying a chromosomal deletion of MY03 and a plasmid which contains a functional MY03 gene were mutagenized . Mutants which die if forced to lose the plas - mid - borne MY03 were then identified by replica plating mutagenized colonies onto solid media containing 5 - FOA . 5 - FOA kills cells expressing the URA3 gene , a nutritional marker present on the MYO3 - containing plasmid . There - fore , cells that cannot lose the MYO3 - containing plasmid will not grow on 5 - FOA . Three mutant strains ( Cll , 37 , and D2 ) which were dependent on the MY03 plasmid were produced using this synthetic lethal screen . Dependence of these strains on MY03 was demonstrated in three ways . First , the mutants were transformed with a second plasmid ( p314SRMY03 ) containing the MY03 gene and a different selectable marker ( TRP1 ) . These strains were now able to grow on 5 - FOA . In addition , plasmid loss assays indicate that these transformants could lose either MYO3 - bearing plasmid , but not both . Second , mutants containing the MY03 gene under control of the galactose promoter displayed a galac - tose dependence for growth . Finally , a mutant form of p314SRMY03 containing a MY03 gene with a frame shift in the tail of MY03 ( Fig . 1 ) will not support growth of the mutant . Backcrossing of the synthetic lethal mutants to the parent strain indicated that the mutations were recessive . Complementation tests indicated that all three synthetic lethal strains were in the same complementation group . A new yeast myosin gene , MY05 , was cloned by com - plementation of the synthetic lethal phenotype . In comple - mentary studies , this gene was also identified by PCR us - ing degenerate , myosin I - specific oligonucleotides . The sequence of Myo5p ( Fig . 2 ) shows that MY05 encodes a classic myosin I protein , like MY03 . It is 76 . 6 % identical to MY03 over the whole protein , 87 and 62 % identical in the head and tail , respectively . All of the motor and tail domains expected from a classic myosin I and identified in the tail of MY03 are also found in MY05 , including a ba - sic ( putative membrane - binding ) region , an SH3 domain ( Src Homology 3 ; see Hammer , 1991 for review ) , and a hy - per - proline - rich region 10 amino acids before the SH3 do - main ( Goodson and Spudich , 1995 ) . The region 100 amino acids amino terminal to the SH3 domain contains a higher proline content than that of the corresponding region in MY03 ( 25 vs 17 % proline , respectively ) . In this respect , MY05 is more similar to other classical myosin I proteins than MY03 . Like MY03 , MY05 contains two IQ motifs , which are putative light chain binding sites ( Cheney and Mooseker , 1992 ) . The stretch of acidic residues followed Figure 1 .

Aliquots were removed periodically from all cultures and the cells were soni - cated briefly to disrupt cell clumps . Cell densities were determined by OD6co measure - ments and apparent doubling times were calculated . Figure 2 . Derived amino acid sequence of Myo5p . This sequence is based on the DNA sequence of the MY05 gene . The MY05 DNA sequence shows 99 % identity to sequence SC9718 . 08 ob - tained by the yeast genome sequencing project . The ATP binding site ( underlined ) ; IQ motifs ( 11 ) ; and SH3 motif ( D ) . by a tryptophan which is found at the end of both MY03 and Aspergillus nidulans MYOA ( McGoldrick et al . , 1995 ) is also found in MY05 . The functional significance of this sequence is not known . Sequence analysis of complement - ing genomic yeast DNA in regions adjacent to the MY05 gene indicate that this gene is located adjacent to ILV2 , a gene required for amino acid biosynthesis previously mapped to chromosome XIII by classic genetic techniques ( Falco and Dumas , 1985 ; Falco et al . , 1985 ) . Mutants Bearing Deletions in MY03 and MY05 Display Slow Growth MY05 mutants obtained from the synthetic lethal screen were found after backcrossing to be viable under standard growth conditions ( YPAD , pH 5 . 5 , 30°C ) , but display se - vere growth defects . Therefore , the role of myosin I pro - teins in yeast cell function was studied in mutant yeast strains bearing deletions in one or both of the myosin I genes . Deletion of one myosin I gene has no significant ef - fect on growth rates : myo3A and myo5za single mutants display doubling times equivalent to isogenic wild - type cells ( Table II ; Goodson and Spudich , 1995 ) . In contrast , cells bearing deletions in MY03 and MY05 show greatly lengthened doubling times ( Table II ) . Approximately 10 % of the cells in an exponentially growing myo3 & rnyo5za mutant culture are inviable , as determined using the fun - gal viability dye Fun - 1 . However , mathematical modeling of cell doubling indicates that this loss of cell viability con - tributes to but is not solely responsible for low growth rates ( data not shown ) . Double mutants are sensitive to cold ( 15°C ) and ele - vated ( 37°C ) temperature ( Fig . 3 ) . Double mutants did not accumulate at a particular point in the cell cycle after shift to cold ( data not shown ) . During exponential growth at 30°C , they displayed a similar proportion of unbudded , small , medium , and large budded cells as the wild - type pa - rental strain . Double mutants were defective for growth on solid rich media with high osmotic strength ( 0 . 75 M NaC1 ) or low pH ( 3 . 5 ) . Tetrad analysis revealed that sensi - tivity to cold , elevated temperature , high osmotic strength , and low pH showed 2 : 2 segregation and segregated with deletion of both MY03 and MY05 ( Fig . 3 ) . Transforma - tion of myo3A , myo5A mutants with a centromeric plasmid bearing MY05 under its own promoter restores the wild - type growth rates at 30°C ( Table II ) , as well as growth at low and high temperatures , low pH , and high osmotic strength ( data not shown ) . Thus , the low growth rate , sen - sitivity to cold , acidic pH , and high osmolarity observed in the myo3A , myo5za double mutants are due to the loss of both type I myosins . To evaluate the localization of Myo5p in yeast ( see be - low ) , we constructed epitope - tagged Myo5p by insertion of three copies of the myc tag ( Evan et al . , 1985 ) at the ex - treme COOH terminus of the protein , myc - tagged Myo5p was expressed in the myo3 & myo5A mutant using a low copy plasmid under control of the endogenous MY05 pro - moter , myc - tagged Myo5p restored normal growth rates in the myosin I double deletion mutant ( Table II ) . This ob - servation indicates that myc - tagged Myo5p is functional in living yeast . Actin Patches and Cables Are Depolarized in the Double Mutant , myo3 A , myo5 A The actin cytoskeleton of exponentially growing cultures of a wild - type haploid strain , a myo5A single mutant , and a myo3A , myo5A double deletion strain were visualized us - ing rhodamine - phalloidin . The wild - type isogenic strain ( HA10 - 1b ) exhibits a typical polarized arrangement of ac - tin patches ( Fig . 4 B ) . 95 % of wild - type cells with small - and medium - sized buds have actin patches exclusively in the buds . These actin patches appear to be invaginations in the plasma membrane which are invested with F - actin ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) and are thought to be involved in Goodson et al . Myosin 1 Function in Yeast 1281 Figure 3 . Growth characteristics of the myo3A , rnyo5A mutant . HA31 , a diploid bearing deletion of both chromosomal copies of MY03 and of one chromosomal copy of MY05 , was sporulated . Haploid cells were isolated by tetrad dissection and were grown at 30°C on rich media ( YPD ) . These cells were replica plated onto vari - ous media and grown at the temperatures shown . SC - trp was used to select for cells bearing disrup - tion of MY05 and insertion of a TRP1 marker . Sensitivity to cold , elevated temperatures and high osmotic strength were evaluated by growth on YPD at 14°C , 37°C and YPD supplemented with 0 . 75 M KC1 at 30°C . A representative tetrad is shown . late steps of secretion and / or early steps of endocytosis ( Novick et al . , 1981 ; Ktibler and Riezman , 1993 ) . Asym - metric arrangement of actin patches is lost in the double deletion strain ( Fig . 4 D ) . The patches of cortical actin are distributed randomly over the surface of both mother and bud : polarization of actin patches exclusively in buds oc - curs in only 8 % of the rnyo3A , myo5A mutants studied . This finding suggests that yeast myosin I proteins are re - quired for polarized arrangement of actin patches . Consis - tent with this observation , proper cortical actin polariza - tion can be fully restored by replacing MY05 on a low copy ( centromere ) plasmid under the control of its own promoter ( Fig . 4 F ) . Actin cables are the other major component of the yeast actin cytoskeleton . These cables are bundles of filamen - tous actin that are believed to function as tracks for polar - ized transport of organelles and vesicles from the mother cell to the bud ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . In wild - type cells and in rnyo5A single mutants , actin cables are ar - ranged in radial arrays that extend throughout the mother cell and converge at the bud neck ( Fig . 4 B ) . The presence of brightly stained cortical actin patches in the mother cell of rnyo3A , myo5A mutants precluded resolution of actin cables by conventional fluorescence microscopy . How - ever , these structures are readily detectable by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 5 ) . Some actin cables are observed to ex - tend along the mother bud axis in the double mutant , as in the wild - type cell . However , many cables appear to be dis - organized in the myo3A , myo5A double mutant : these ca - bles are observed to extend across the mother cell rather than toward the bud neck . Our findings indicate that dele - tion of yeast myosin I genes results in loss of actin cable and patch polarization without qualitatively affecting the total staining intensity of these cytoskeletal elements . Mitochondrial and Nuclear DNA Inheritance Occurs in the Double Mutant , myo3 A , myoS A Previous studies indicate that mutations in the actin - encod - ing ACT1 gene result in defects in nuclear migration dur - ing cell division , aggregation of mitochondria , as well as defects in mitochondrial motility and inheritance ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Drubin et al . , 1993 ; Lazzarino et al . , 1994 ; Simon et al . , 1995 ) . The arrangement of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in wild - type cells and in the myo3A , myo5A mutant was examined using the fluorescent DNA binding dye DAPI . In wild - type cells , DAPI staining reveals threads of mitochondria in both the mother cell and bud and accumulation of mitochondria in the bud tip ( Fig . 4 A ) . Nuclear staining is quite prominent . In some cases , nuclei were observed to extend from a mother cell to the bud and were therefore fixed during transport of nuclei into a bud ( Fig . 4 A ) . In myo3A , myo5A mutant cells , mitochondria show low levels of aggregation but extended tubular mitochondrial structures are clearly visible ( Fig . 4 C ) . Transformation of the myo3A , myo5A mutant strain with a centromeric plas - mid containing MY05 fully rescues the wild - type mito - chondrial phenotype ( Fig . 4 E ) . Thus , deletion of both of these yeast myosin I genes causes some defects in mito - chondrial spatial arrangement . However , transport of mi - tochondria into buds is not significantly affected in the double mutant . In mutant and wild - type strains , mitochon - drial tubules were observed traversing the bud neck and accumulating at the bud tip . In addition , mitochondrial DNA was observed to be transferred to buds in greater than 90 % of cells bearing small - to medium - sized buds . Nuclear inheritance also appears to be normal in myo3A , myo5A , mutants : fewer than 3 % of cells examined display multinucleation ( data not shown ) . The myo3 A , myo5 A Mutant Displays Defects in Chitin Deposition and Cell Shape Shortly before bud emergence , a ring of chitin is formed in the yeast cell wall . The bud then emerges within the con - fines of this chitin ring . After cell - cell separation , a chitin - containing ring is left on the surface of mother cells . Thus , chitin localization is an indicator of the polarity of bud site selection : haploid cells typically show an axial budding pat - tern and produce buds to previous bud sites . In contrast , diploid cells display a bipolar budding pattern and pro - duce buds either adjacent to or at the pole opposite from previous bud sites ( Roberts et al . , 1983 ) . Since polarization of actin cables and patches is disrupted in myo3A , myo5A double mutants , it was of interest to determine whether the polarized bud site selection and chitin deposition might also be affected . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , 1996 1282 Figure 4 . Actin , mitochondrial , and nuclear structure in wild - type cells , myo3A , myo5A double mutants and in double deletion mutants rescued with MY05 gene . Wild - type HA10 - 1b ( A and B ) , myo3zl , myo5za double deletion strain ( HA31 - 9c ; C and D ) , and myo3A , myo5A mutants rescued with MY05 on a low copy plasmid ( E and F ) were grown to mid - log phase at 30°C , fixed with paraformalde - hyde , converted to spheroplasts , and stained with DAPI ( A , C , and E ) and rhodamine phalloidin ( B , D , and 17 ) . DAPI staining reveals threads of mitochondria are inherited in all three strains ( A , C , and E ) , but only the double mutant strain shows aggregation of mito - chondria ( C ) . Wild - type parental strain and MY05 rescued myo3A , myo5A double mutants show cortical actin patches polarized to the bud and actin cables prevalent in mother cells ( B and F ) . Actin patches are randomly distributed over the surface of mother and bud in a large majority of myo3A , myo5A double mutant cells ( D ) . b , bud ; m , mitochondria ; n , nucleus . Bar , 2 ixm . Goodson et al . Myosin 1 Function in Yeast 1283 Figure 5 . The rnyo3A , myo5A mutant displays defects in organiza - tion of yeast actin cables . Mid - log phase wild - type yeast ( HA10 - lb ; A ) and a myo3A , myo5A double mutant ( HA31 - 9c ; B ) were stained with rhodamine - phalloidin as for Fig . 4 . Actin cable struc - ture was examined by confocal microscopy . The direction of the arrows illustrates the orientation of actin cables . Bar , 2 ~ m . In wild - type cells , chitin rings are resolved as brightly stained rings using Calcofluor white ( Fig . 6 A ) . These rings are normally restricted to one pole of the cell in haploid yeast . HA10 - 1b , a wild - type strain isogenic with myosin I single and double mutants , does not display the highly se - lective budding pattern expected of haploid yeast : bud site selection occurs both adjacent and distal to previous bud sites ( Goodson and Spudich , 1995 ) . The bud site selection pattern of haploid , myosin I single mutants is indistin - guishable from that of HA10 - 1b ( Fig . 6 , B and C ) . 72 % of cells have chitin rings that are restricted to the poles of the long axis of a mother cell . The Calcofluor white staining pattern of the myo3A , rnyo5A double mutant is markedly different from that seen in wild - type or either single mutant ( Fig . 6 D ) . Approxi - mately 40 % of budded cells display diffuse chitin deposi - tion over the surface of the mother cell . Bright Calcofluor - stained patches , which are never detected in wild - type cells or in myo3A and myo5A single mutants , are present on 64 % of double mutant cells . Chitin rings , which are dis - tinct from chitin patches , are also detected in myo3A , myo5A mutants . However , only 23 % of the double mu - tants contained chitin rings at polar regions of the cell . Thus , these mutants display defects in bud site selection during polarized cell growth and division . Finally , the di - ameter of bud scars is variable in myo3A , myo5A mutants with many of the scars being enlarged with respect to wild - type cells ( data not shown ) . Defects in size and shape of myo3A , myo5A mutants are also revealed by Calcofluor white stain . In wild - type yeast , early stages of bud growth are polarized and directed to the bud tip . Thereafter , growth is directed over the entire bud surface ( Farkas et al . , 1974 ) . This pattern of bud growth produces oval shaped cells ( Fig . 6 A ) . The length to width ratio of wild - type HA10 - 1b haploid yeast is 1 . 137 _ _ _ 0 . 109 ( n = 179 ) . Enlarged cells ( > 7 ~ m ) are rare in wild - type cultures , accounting for < 7 % of the population dur - ing mid - log growth . Single mutations in either MY03 or MY05 lead to slightly rounder cells with a length to width ratio of 1 . 085 _ _ + 0 . 087 ( n = 144 ) and 1 . 065 _ _ _ 0 . 101 ( n = 158 ) , respectively , but there is no apparent accumulation of enlarged cells ( Fig . 6 , B and C ) . In contrast , > 80 % of double mutant cells are spherical or nearly spherical ( Fig . 6 D ) , and a small but significant minority of cells ( 15 % ) are enlarged in comparison to wild - type cells ( > 7 ~ m in length ) . Electron Microscopy Reveals Asymmetrically Thickened Cell Walls and IntraceUular Membrane Accumulation in the myo3A , myoS A Mutant The ultrastructure of myo3A mutant cells and myo5A mu - tant cells is similar to that of wild - type yeast cells ( Fig . 7 , A - C ) . A single large vacuole occupies a considerable por - tion of the cytoplasm , and a nucleus , mitochondria , and tu - bules of endoplasmic reticulum can be distinguished in most cells . When a mother - daughter pair is sectioned such that both cells and their bud neck are visible , all identifi - able organelle structures are detected in transit through the bud neck into the daughter cell . Cell walls are resolved as an electron translucent inner portion 100 - 300 - nm - thick surrounded by an electron dense shell of mannoproteins ( reviewed in Klis , 1994 ) . The ultrastructure of vacuoles , mitochondria , ER , and nucleus is not significantly affected by deletion of MY03 and MY05 . However , 65 % of budded myo3A , myo5A mu - tant cells accumulate multilamellar structures ( Figs . 7 D and 8 B , arrow ) . These multilamellar organelles are ~ 200 - 500 nm in diameter and are often enriched in the bud . These structures resemble the " Berkeley Bodies " which have been previously described in late secretory mutants ( Novick et al . , 1981 ) . Similar structures are not seen in wild - type cells or either single type I myosin mutant . Smaller vesicles ( 50 - 80 - nm diam ) also appear to accumu - late in rnyo3A , myo5A mutants . These smaller vesicles are much less abundant than the multilamellar structures ( Fig . 8 B , arrowhead ) . myo3A , myo5A also display thickened cell walls . The cell walls of HA10 - 1b , the wild - type cell , and of myo3A and myo5A single mutant cells are 210 _ _ 38 , 202 _ + 34 , and 212 _ _ 48 nm thick , respectively , and never exceeded a thickness of 500 nm . In contrast , 34 % of myo3A , myo5A cells exam - ined displayed cell walls which exceeded 500 nm ; in some cells , wall thicknesses greater than i I ~ m were observed . A pattern of concentric rings can be seen in many of the cells with extremely thick cell walls , suggesting that they are built through repeated deposition of cell wall material . In addi - tion , virtually all cell wall thickening was detected in the mother cell : most buds display normal cell wall thickness . To address whether defects in cell wall deposition and The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , 1996 1284 Figure 6 . The myo3A , myo5A mutant displays defects in chitin deposition , cell size , and cell shape .

Arrow ( A ) points to chitin rings which are localized at the poles of the mother cell in wild - type cells and single mutants , and randomly distributed in the myo3A , myo5A double mutant .

Bar , 2 ixm . membrane accumulation observed in the myo3A , myo5A double mutant are consequences of long term perturba - tion of the actin cytoskeleton , we studied a mutant bearing defects in the actin - encoding ACT1 gene . The tempera - ture sensitive act1 - 3 mutant used undergoes loss of actin cables at all conditions and temperature - dependent depo - larization of actin patches ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . At permissive temperature ( 22°C ) , act1 - 3 cells display cell wall thickness similar to that of wild - type cells ( Fig . 8 C ) . After short - term shift of the act1 - 3 cells to 37°C , we ob - serve modest cell wall thickening ( Fig . 8 D ) . Moreover , we observe extensive cell wall thickening in act1 - 3 mutants propagated at semi - permissive temperatures ( 30°C ) for multiple generations ( data not shown ) . These observations are consistent with a previous report that cell wall thicken - ing occurs in actin mutants incubated at restrictive temper - atures for prolonged time periods ( Gabriel and Kopeck ~ , 1995 ) . The actin mutant also displays abnormal intracellular membrane accumulation . At 22°C , actl - 3 cells display some small vesicle accumulation ( Fig . 8 C ) . After shift to restric - tive temperature ( 37°C ) for 45 min , these mutants show accumulation of both small vesicles and multilamellar ves - icles ( Fig . 8 D ) . The levels of accumulated membranes dif - fer in the actin mutant compared to the myosin I double deletion mutant . In the myo3A , myo5A double mutant multilamellar structures are abundant and small vesicles are rare . In contrast , small vesicles are abundant and mul - tilamellar structures are rare in act1 - 3 cells after short term shift to 37°C . However , upon propagation of the actin mu - tant at a semi - restrictive temperature ( 30°C ) , the amount of multilamellar structures and 50 - 80 nm vesicles in the actl - 3 strain is similar to that in the myosin I double dele - tion mutant ( data not shown ) . These findings suggest that defects in cell wall deposition and membrane accumula - tion observed in the myo3A , myo5A double mutant are consequences of long - term perturbation of actin cytoskel - etal organization . myo3 A , myo5 A Mutants Display Defects in Invertase Secretion and Fluid Phase Endocytosis Accumulation of intracellular membranes in the myo3A , myo5A double mutants suggests possible defects in mem - brane trafficking . Therefore , we examined the effect of myo - sin I gene deletion on invertase secretion and fluid phase en - docytosis of Lucifer yellow . Invertase is a highly glycoslyated , secretory protein which catalyzes cleavage of a - glycosidic Goodson et al . Myosin I Function in Yeast 1285 Figure 7 . The myo3A , myo5A mutant displays cell wall thickening and intracellular accumulation of membranes . Wild - type ( HA10 - 1b ; A ) , myo3A mutant ( HA31 - 9a ; B ) , myo5A mutant ( HA51 - 1a ; C ) , and myo3A , myo5A mutant ( HA31 - 9c ; D ) cells were grown to mid - log phase at 30°C . Cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde , stained with KMnO4 , embedded , and sectioned . Arrows indicate large multilamellar vesicles ; Arrowheads indicate small vesicles ; n , nucleus ; v , vacuole . Bar , 1 Ixm . linkages and is required for growth using many di - and trisaccharides as a carbon source . The myo3 & myo5A dou - ble mutant displays low but detectable growth on medium containing the trisaccharide raffinose . While poor growth on raffinose is consistent with a defect in invertase secre - tion , this result is difficult to interpret because the double mutant also displays poor growth on galactose and glyc - erol ( data not shown ) . However , defects in the rate of in - vertase secretion can also be shown biochemically ( Fig . 9 ) . Wild - type cells secrete invertase immediately after induc - tion of invertase expression and display a maximal level of external invertase within 90 min . In contrast , myo3A , myo5A mutants display a delay in the onset of invertase secretion after induction . Analysis of intracellular invertase re - vealed accumulation of partially processed glycosylation intermediates during this initial lag phase ( data not shown ) . Thus , the double mutant is capable of responding to induc - tion , but displays defects in the invertase secretion path - way . Invertase secretion is detected within 60 min after in - duction of the myosin I double mutant and occurs at rates similar to that of isogenic wild - type strains up to 180 min after induction . The maximum level of invertase secretion in the mutant is 25 % greater than that of the wild - type cell . It is possible that the thickened cell wall of the myosin double deletion mutant retains greater levels of secreted invertase . Lucifer yellow is a hydrophilic fluorescent dye which is excluded from cells by their plasma membrane . Yeast take up Lucifer yellow by fluid phase endocytosis and target the dye to their vacuole ( Riezman , 1985 ) . Mutations af - fecting actin or the actin binding protein Sac6p perturb this process ( Ktibler and Riezman , 1993 ) . Lucifer yellow uptake into the vacuole is observed in > 90 % of wild - type HA10 - 1b cells after 30 min of incubation . In contrast , Lu - cifer yellow uptake and accumulation in the vacuole was observed in only 10 % of myo3A , myo5A mutants under the same experimental conditions ( Fig . 10 ) . After 120 min of incubation with Lucifer yellow , the percentage of double mutant cells with labeled vacuoles was unchanged . Thus , deletion of myosin I genes compromises fluid phase en - docytosis in yeast . Myo5p Co - localizes with Actin Patches To determine the subcellular localization of Myo5p , the wild - type MY05 gene was tagged with three copies of the myc epitope , and expressed in the myo3A , myo5A mutant . To insure that myc - tagged Myo5p was expressed at levels The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , 1996 1286 Figure 8 .

As described above , expression of the epitope - tagged Myo5p in the myo3A , myo5A mutant restores normal growth rates ( Table II ) . Therefore , addition of the myc tag to the COOH terminus of Myo5p does not appear to have a del - eterious effect on Myo5p function . The expression and detection of the tagged protein was evaluated using Western blot analysis ( Fig . 11 a ) and indi - rect immunofluorescenee ( Fig . 11 b ) . We find that the anti - myc monoclonal antibody 9El0 ( Evan et al . , 1985 ) recognizes a single band in whole cell extracts of myc - Myo5p - expressing cells ( Fig . 11 A ) . The antibody does not recognize any protein in the myo3A , myo5A mutant or in a myo3A , myo5A mutant expressing untagged Myo5p . The electrophoretic mobility of the band detected in myc - Myo5p - expressing cells , 135 kD , is in good agreement with the size predicted from the DNA sequence of the MY05 gene . Double label indirect immunofluorescence experiments indicate that mye - tagged Myo5p localizes with actin patches ( Fig . 11 B ) . Within the bud , myc - tagged Myo5p is detected in some , but not all , of the actin patches . In addition , we observe co - localization of myc - tagged Myo5p with actin patches that accumulate at the site of bud emergence , myc - tagged Myo5p was not de - tected in actin cables . Discussion Myosin I ' s are ubiquitous proteins expected to play an im - portant role in cytoskeletal function . In a previous study , the first yeast myosin I was identified ( Goodson and Spu - dich , 1995 ) . This classic myosin I protein is encoded by the MY03 gene . Deletion of this gene has no obvious effect . This raised the possibility that yeast contain other pro - tein ( s ) with redundant function ( s ) . Our approach to study myosin I function was to use a synthetic lethality screen to identify yeast proteins which are functionally redundant with Myo3p . This screen revealed a new classic myosin ! gene , MY05 . MY05 is 75 . 4 % identical to MY03 . Both genes contain coding regions for motor and tail sub - domains typical of a classic myosin I including a basic ( possible mem - brane - binding ) region , an SH3 domain , and a proline - rich Goodson et al .

Aliquots were taken at the indicated times and assayed for external invertase . region ( for review see Hammer , 1991 ) . Deletion of either MY03 or MY05 has no obvious phenotype . However , we show that a yeast strain bearing deletions of both MY03 and MY05 displays severe growth defects , enlarged cell size , delocalized and disorganized chitin deposition , asym - metrically thickened cell walls , disruption in the normal polar distribution of actin , accumulation of abnormal membrane bound structures and growth defects under conditions of osmotic stress , low pH , low temperature and elevated temperature . Our findings indicate that yeast MY03 and MY05 genes encode classic myosin I proteins with overlapping function . These results are the first ge - netic demonstration that myosin I proteins are required for normal cell function in yeast . The phenotype of the myosin I double deletion mutant is similar to that of yeast strains bearing mutations that perturb the actin cytoskeleton . For example , mutation of actin ( ACT1 ) or the actin - binding proteins fimbrin ( SAC6 ) , capping protein ( CAP1 - 2 ) , profilin ( PFY1 ) , or myosin V ( MY02 ) leads to most or all of the following phenotypes : partial or complete loss of actin cables , actin patch depo - larization , rounded cell shape , random bud site selection , vesicle and membrane accumulation , cell wall thickening , sensitivity to high osmotic strength , defects in chitin depo - sition , invertase secretion , endocytosis , and mitochondrial organization ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Haarer et al . , 1990 ; Rodriguez and Patterson 1990 ; Adams et al . , 1991 ; Johnston et al . , 1991 ; Amatruda et al . , 1992 ; Chowdhury et al . , 1992 ; Liu and Bretscher , 1992 ; Kiibler and Riezman , 1993 ; Drubin et al . , 1993 ; Lazzarino et al . , 1994 ; Simon et al . , 1995 ) . One distinguishing feature of the myosin I dou - ble deletion mutant is that the depolarization of actin structures occurs without a significant reduction in the amount of either actin cables or patches . This , coupled with the observation that the phenotype of the myosin I double deletion mutant is similar to that of strains with mutations in actin or actin - binding proteins , supports a role for Myo3p and Myo5p in control of actin cable and patch polarization . At present , this myosin I double dele - tion mutant and cells bearing mutations in the SLA1 , RVS161 , or RVS167 genes are the only yeast mutants de - fective specifically in actin organization ( Bauer et al . , 1993 ; Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; and Silvadon et al . , 1995 ) . However , since actin cables are difficult to detect in myo3A , myo5A mutants by epifluorescence microscopy , it is possible that other mutants thought to have a significant reduction in actin cables may instead have a similar loss of actin organi - zation . Since myosin I proteins have been implicated in control of membrane - actin interactions , it is possible that Myo3p and Myo5p serve as organelle motors for vesicle move - ment during endocytosis and secretion . This interpretation is consistent with the postulated function of classic myosin I proteins in Aspergillus ( McGoldrick et al . , 1995 ) . How - ever , actin organization is altered upon deletion of yeast myosin I genes . In addition , actin is known to be necessary for secretion and endocytosis in yeast . Therefore , we favor the interpretation that the primary function of yeast myo - sin I proteins is control of actin organization , and we pro - pose that the observed defects in secretion , endocytosis , and osmotic sensitivity are secondary effects due to loss of actin organization . This interpretation is supported by the finding that Myo5p is present in actin patches . Indirect immunofluo - rescence and epitope - tagging were used to determine the localization of Myo5p . We find that the myc - tagged pro - tein is fully functional and observe co - localization of myc - tagged Myo5p with actin patches under conditions where the tagged protein was expressed at levels similar to wild - type Myo5p . Previous studies suggest that ( a ) actin patches are invaginations in the plasma membrane that are associ - ated with F - actin ( Mullholland et al . , 1994 ) , and ( b ) actin nucleation and assembly occur at actin patches in the bud of small - budded cells . This nucleation activity requires the SLA1 and SLA2 gene products and may be regulated by Cdc42p , a Rho - like GTP binding protein ( Li et al . , 1995 ) . Thus , the finding that Myo5p is localized at actin patches is consistent with a model whereby myosin I proteins are re - quired for polarization of the actin cytoskeleton . In princi - Figure 11 .

For example , the temperature - sensitive act1 - 3 mutant displays severe defects in mitochondrial organization and motility , accumulation of high levels of 50 - nm vesicles , and only lim - ited accumulation of multilamellar structures which resem - ble Berkeley bodies ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Drubin et al . , 1993 ; Lazzarino et al . , 1994 ; Simon et al . , 1995 ) . In con - trast , deletion of both yeast myosin I genes results in accu - mulation of high levels of multilamellar structures and only minor defects in mitochondrial organization and 50 - nm vesicle accumulation . We observe that some of these dif - ferences are due to chronic versus acute actin disorgani - zation . However , it is also possible that the variation in phenotype severity reflects differential dependence of dif - ferent processes on actin cables and actin patches . As de - scribed above , deletion of MY03 and MY05 results in de - fects in polarization of actin cable and patch structures without significantly affecting the number of actin patches and cables . In contrast , act1 - 3 mutants show complete loss of actin cables under all conditions and depolarized actin patches only at restrictive temperature . Therefore , it is possible that mitochondria , which co - localize with actin cables ( Drubin et al . , 1993 ; Lazzarino et al . , 1994 ) , may be more severely compromised in mutants like act1 - 3 which do not contain these actin structures . In contrast , the rela - tively strong effect of the deletion of MY03 and MY05 on endocytosis may reflect a dependence of this process on the specific organization of cytoskeletal elements , possibly at a very local level . The conservation of classic myosin I proteins in evolu - tionarily divergent organisms ( Goodson and Spudich , 1993 ; Cheney et al . , 1993 ) suggests that they have a significant role in many eukaryotic cell types . It has long been postu - lated that myosin I proteins play a role in the generation of cell motility ( for review , see Pollard et al . , 1991 ; Spudich and Warrick , 1991 ) . Results from analysis of Dictyostelium myosin I mutants support this idea ( Titus et al . , 1993 ) . Here , we show that two classic myosin I proteins are im - portant for cell growth in an organism which does not move . Similar results were obtained recently in Aspergillus ( McGoldrick et al . , 1995 ) . These results demonstrate that classic myosin I proteins are fundamentally important to the function of non - motile cells and suggest that they have a key role in cytoskeletal processes common to both mo - tile and non - motile cells . More specifically , we provide ev - idence that ( a ) MY03 and MY05 encode myosin I pro - teins with overlapping function , and ( b ) these classic myosin I proteins are necessary for control of actin polar - ity in yeast . Our results in yeast , together with recent re - sults in Dictyostelium ( Novak et al . , 1995 ) , suggest that myosin I proteins play an important organizational role in the actin cytoskeleton in many eukaryotes .
