This comes from analysing the path - lengths between the initiation point of CME ( cargo binding ) and the node of interest or the number of links required to get from one protein to another ( protein complexes such as AP2 are treated as a single node and this type of analysis discounts the effects of protein concentration and affinities ) . To have a component work later in a pathway then an extra path - length / link gives a molecular - clock delay to this event . We can give the approximate time line of events in CME by concentrating on path - lengths in the pathway protein interactome ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . There is one path - length between cargo and AP2 , there are two path - lengths connecting cargo to accessory proteins and clathrin , and there are three path - lengths to dynamin and Hsc70 . Dynamin is connected into the network through accessory proteins such as snx9 , intersectin and amphiphysin ( amphiphysin shown in Fig . 4a ) and not via the clathrin hub , as dynamin function is spatially separated from clathrin ( dynamin acts at the neck of the nascent vesicle ) . In vivo fluorescence studies of clathrin coated pit dynamics validate the time line ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) where dynamin and auxilin / Hsc70 are seen to act just before clathrin spots leave the visualisation field in total internal reflection microscopy experiments . The actin machinery comes into play after this , where actin modulators in our pathway protein interactome would have a path - length of three to four from cargo binding . While overexpression of labelled proteins can give much information about the pathway , there are limitations of these visualisation approaches . Here we can be informed by the pathway protein interactome . Firstly , the pathway protein interactome time line gives information on early events that are difficult to probe with fluorescent markers . Clathrin is generally the marker used to identify coated pit formation , and so events occurring before clathrin begins to polymerise may well be difficult to identify , since in early stages of network assembly AP2 may not be as highly concentrated and may be much more dynamic . Even after clathrin is detected as a spot the ability to detect AP2 in this spot will depend on the labelling efficiency 1 . Secondly , the pathway protein interactome tells us doi : 10 . 1038 / nature0 6031 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION www . nature . com / nature 2 that overexpression of nodes will frequently cause the system to work sub - optimally if is able to disrupt a hub and so the resulting data should be treated with care . Part 2 : Interactomes aid in experimental interpretations Network diagrams can help biologists in interpreting or even predicting experimental outcomes . We argued in the main text that effects of depletion or overexpression of proteins depend on their status in the network ( hub vs . node ) . Hub proteins are predicted to not have a major phenotype when overexpressed but depletion of hubs has disastrous effects and vice versa for node proteins . We see this in the overexpression of clathrin and AP2 components having no effects on transferrin endocytosis while depletions of these hubs do 2 - 4 . Deletion of only one AP2 appendage will lead to a clustered AP2 hub zone with fewer appendages . This will only show an effect if one looks for internalisation of specific cargo that is dependent on an alternative cargo adaptor which is specific for the now missing appendage . Precise examples for this are the combined data from the following references 5 - 7 . AP2 complexes without the (cid:1) - appendage showed no effect in transferrin uptake in HeLa cells . Depletion of (cid:1) - ear in Drosophila on the other hand showed a severe phenotype on notch uptake which is dependent on the alternative cargo adaptor numb that is only recruited via the (cid:1) - but not the (cid:2) - appendage . Depletions of many accessory proteins have a minimal phenotype while overexpression is much more effective at producing phenotypes 7 - 10 . Overexpression of any individual cargo molecule would automatically lead to a reduced incorporation of other components that bind to the same cargo adaptor . This could easily have devastating consequences on vesicles that require multiple cargos to function ( like synaptic vesicles ) . Overexpression of a protein not directly linked to the hubs in the pathway , like dynamin , will also have few consequences 11 as these do not titrate out the organising centres . Depletion of dynamin has significant effects on CME because it needs to oligomerise to function and it has significant effects on a cell 8 because the protein is positioned between pathways . The further one moves away from the hubs in a pathway the more difficult it is to predict phenotypes . Although we have only considered proteins , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 could also be considered to be a hub ( see Fig . 3bii ) , as many of the adaptors and accessory proteins doi : 10 . 1038 / nature0 6031 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION www . nature . com / nature 3 bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Like dynamin , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is on the boundary between many different processes and manipulation will give widespread effects . A word of caution : a negative result from siRNA could mean that the protein is a node , but one also needs to be sure that there was sufficient depletion and no functional redundancy . Also , when overexpressing proteins one needs to make sure there is sufficient overexpression to test if the network can be distorted and overexpressed proteins can also have indirect consequences ( for example if one inhibits exocytosis of a receptor then there will consequently be none available for endocytosis ) . In summary a pathway protein interactome gives a rational basis for predictable and testable phenotypes from RNAi versus overexpression experiments and helps them to be appropriately interpreted . Part 3 : Clustered - hubs Clustered - hubs are a new subtype of hubs not previously described . Proteins with multiple interaction surfaces have previously been recognised as a distinct type of hub that can interact with multiple partners simultaneously 12 . However in our pathway network we find hubs that can be composed of clustered proteins each with multiple interaction surfaces that can interact with multiple proteins simultaneously ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . There is also another possible type of clustered - hub composed of proteins with one interaction surface that might be able to interact with multiple proteins , but only at different times or locations ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . This second type of protein is likely to contain an interaction domain like an SH3 domain , SH2 domain , EH domain , PTB domain or adaptor appendage domain , that can bind to short sequence motifs dispersed in the interaction partners . From a pathway - centric viewpoint we do not consider proteins with sequential interactions as functional hubs unless they are clustered . Supplementary Figure 3 illustrates the different oligomerised hub possibilities . Part 4 : Hub conservation and tissue specificity We mentioned in the main text that a hub - centric pathway has the advantage of easily being able to add additional modules to the system . In CME , introducing alternative cargo adaptors was such an example . Moreover , addition of such alternative adaptors doi : 10 . 1038 / nature0 6031 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION www . nature . com / nature 4 could also be an evolutionary consideration , to ensure that the retrieval of some ligands is less dependent on adaptors like AP2 which could well be partially occupied by other activated receptors 13 , 14 . It has been noted previously by network biologists that alternative routes provide robustness and account for apparent redundancy in networks 15 - 17 . We investigated the conservation of the CME network across species in great detail and observed that conservation of endocytic proteins through the animal kingdom was high and the connectivity of accessory proteins is also mostly conserved ( Supplementary Table 1 and 2 ) . In lower organisms there is less duplication of proteins and thus less redundancy and so knock - out phenotypes tend to be stronger . It has to be mentioned that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the core proteins and many of the accessory proteins are present but it appears that the process is not as dependent on clathrin and actin may play a more important role 18 . The network would consequently look different and thus is not included here . There is a trend for higher eukaryotes to have brain - specialised isoforms as well as ubiquitous forms of many proteins , while one form of the protein seems to suffice in other multicellular organisms with nervous systems such as Drosophila melanogaster , Caenorhabtidis elegans , and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ( sea urchin ) . It is tempting to suggest that these specialised forms of many node proteins may have allowed the development of the brain as we know it , and would appear to have arisen from gene duplication events in higher organisms . It is interesting that there is also a duplication of genes for exocytic components and synaptic vesicle proteins ( unpublished observation ) . It would be interesting to know if these specialised proteins form a transcriptional cluster to make it easier to turn on all these proteins in the brain . Accessory protein splice variants involved in different pathways When organising a pathway into a network diagram and identifying hub proteins some caution needs to be applied . In higher eukaryotes many proteins have multiple splice variants and these often lead to their involvement in different interaction networks . One example in the clathrin pathway is amphiphysin which in some tissues has a splice form that has clathrin and AP2 interactions motifs and so the protein functions in CME . In other tissues like in muscle the expressed splice form does not contain clathrin and AP2 interaction motifs and the protein does not function in CME but is instead involved in T - tubule formation 19 . Thus we need to be very careful in extrapolating from interactomes doi : 10 . 1038 / nature0 6031 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION www . nature . com / nature 5 which will depict the multiple pathways that amphiphysin is involved in together . Amphiphysin should not be described as a date - hub in the sense that it is the connection between these processes ( especially since these splice variants are expressed in different tissues ) . CME interactome : brain versus peripheral tissues Epsin1 , dynamin1 , dynamin3 , AP180 , amphiphsin1 , amphiphysin2 , intersectin1 and NECAP1 are all brain enriched and other isoforms of these proteins are also found in other tissues . There are differences , in that AP180 in the brain is replaced by CALM in the periphery and brain - enriched amphiphysins are generally replaced by sorting - nexin9 in the periphery . This means that the CME interactome has a conserved architecture , but the accessory adaptors ( add - ons ) do vary widely with cell type . Supplementary Figure 1 ‘Frequency plot’ of endocytic interactions . This shows that the majority of proteins involved in CME interact with up to five protein partners , whereas only two proteins have the ability to interact with significantly more proteins and are thus hubs ( clathrin has 12 interactors and AP2 has 21 interactors ) . Interactions were taken from the network diagram in Figure 1b . doi : 10 . 1038 / nature0 6031 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION www . nature . com / nature 6 Supplementary Figure 2 Time line and hub progression for CME . a ) The path - lengths between membrane cargo and downstream proteins give an approximate time course of events . Thus AP2 has a path length of 1 ( cargo – AP2 ) , while clathrin has a path length of 2 ( cargo – AP2 / accessory protein – clathrin ) and dynamin and hsc70 ( cargo – AP2 – amphiphysin / clathrin – dynamin / hsc70 ) have a path length of 3 . Further downstream event may have longer path lengths and thus will occur with a greater molecular - clock delay . b ) In vivo imaging using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy has given us a time course for the recruitment of AP2 , clathrin , dynamin and auxilin to coated pits which agrees well with the time - line derived from the interactome . These data come from the following papers : ( AP2 , clathrin ) 1 , 20 , ( dynamin , clathrin ) 21 , 22 , ( auxilin , clathrin ) 23 , 24 , ( actin , clathrin ) 25 , 26 . AP2 is seen to be present at the same time as clathrin spots leave the visualisation field in one study 1 but leaves before clathrin in another 27 . This difference is indicated by the dotted line in the AP2 time - line . doi : 10 . 1038 / nature0 6031 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION www . nature . com / nature 7 Supplementary Figure 3 Representation of ‘hub’ - possibilities . Clustered hubs are a new subtype of hubs that we find in CME . These can be composed of proteins with multiple interaction surfaces or a single interaction surface that can bind to different proteins . doi : 10 . 1038 / nature0 6031 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION www . nature . com / nature 8 Supplementary Figure 4 Directionality through changing interaction modes . Affinity - driven interactions have equal on - and off - rates whereas in avidity - driven interactions the off - rates are significantly reduced due to multiple interaction points . The third form of interactions , matricity - driven interactions , involve a rigid matrix which leads to a further reduction in off - rates or the absence of off - rates altogether ( in our case polymerised clathrin has much less flexibility than any of the accessory proteins ) . Supplementary Table 1 Domain structures and functions of CME proteins and their presence in different species . A list of proteins involved in CME was generated using published information , primarily the following papers 28 - 32 . The list is not exhaustive but includes the main components . The domain structure is illustrated and the descriptions of each domain and their occurrences in different proteins can be found at http : / / www . sanger . ac . uk / cgi - bin / Pfam / dql . pl . Clathrin interaction motifs ( marked as ‘x’ ) are incomplete as they are difficult to detect given their sequence variations . Homologues were found by NCBI blast searches and http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / genome / seq / BlastGen / BlastGen . cgi ? taxid = 7668 for sea urchin sequences . We have not given the protein conservation percentage as the interaction regions of most accessory proteins are not folded domains , but weakly conserved regions containing interaction motifs . Thus we have searched for the conservation of overall domain structure combined with key interaction motifs . The details can be found in the expanded supplementary table . Mammalian brain enriched proteins were identified using http : / / symatlas . gnf . org / SymAtlas / and immunoblotting 33 and are shaded in grey . Where only one form of a protein is found in a genome then it is doi : 10 . 1038 / nature0 6031 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION www . nature . com / nature 9 10 frequently difficult to assign it as closer to one homologue over another . In other cases we can assign this , for example AP180 versus CALM can be distinguished through the presence of NPF motifs in CALM only , showing that the brain specialised form is absent in lower organisms . When we do not find clathrin or adaptin interaction motifs in homologues then we generally assume that the protein in not involved in CME . In the case of amphiphysin we know that a Drosophila form of amphiphysin does not have any clathrin or adaptor interaction and does not function in CME and so is not annotated in this table ( see asterisk ) .
