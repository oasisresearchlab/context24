Over the last ten years , single - molecule techniques and structural studies have led to rapid progess in understanding how these biological motors operate . How do they move ? How do they generate force ? How much fuel do they consume , and with what efficiency ? Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton brings these new findings together . This book is for biology , physics , and engineering students who want to learn about the principles of protein mechanics and how it applies to the morphology and motility of cells . Understanding how motors and the cytoskeleton operate requires mechanical concepts such as force , elasticity , http : / / www . sinauer . com / detail . php ? id = 3344 ( 1 of 8 ) [ 11 . 06 . 2003 16 : 11 : 20 Uhr ] Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton - Sinauer Associates , Inc . damping , and work . Introductory physics textbooks address these concepts , yet they are concerned primarily with macroscopic systems , whose motions are qualitatively different from the highly damped , diffusive motion of individual molecules . Mechanics of Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton provides a physical foundation for molecular mechanics . Part I explains how small particles like proteins respond to mechanical , thermal , and chemical forces , Part II focuses on cytoskeletal filaments , and Part III focuses on motor proteins . The treatments are unified in the respect that they are organized around principles rather than proteins : chapters are centered on topics such as structure , chemistry , and mechanics , and different filaments or motors are discussed together . The book assumes a rudimentary knowledge of cell biology as well as freshman physics , though all concepts are introduced from first principles , and numerous boxed examples and figures aid the non - mathematical reader . For the mathematically inclined , detailed proofs of important results are included in the Appendix . About the Author ( s ) Jonathon Howard is currently a Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Washington in Seattle . In July , 2001 , his research group will move to Dresden , Germany , where he is a Director of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics . He earned a Ph . D . in Neurobiology at Australian National University , doing postdoctoral research there as well as at the University of Bristol and the University of California , San Francisco . Dr . Howard ' s current research interests include the mechanics of motor proteins and the cytoskeleton and mechanoelectrical transduction by sensory receptors . The recipient of several scholarships and fellowships , he most recently received a MERIT Award from the National Institutes of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases .

Back to top Reviews and Commentary " The cytoskeleton is an area of intense research and we are in danger of drowning in a sea of facts . What should we try to teach our students about it ? . . . a textbook is needed which starts from first principles and leads to an understanding of the dynamics of the system . And here is that book . " —Edwin Taylor , Nature " The book is a great launching point for gaining a biophysical understanding of the current detailed literature of motility which is increasingly filled with mathematical models describing motility data . As such , it will benefit students of a wide range of biological and physical backgrounds who are interested in understanding the nuts - and - bolts of cellular motility . " —Stephen J .
