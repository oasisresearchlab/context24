REVIEW The convergent evolution of neural substrates for cognition Onur Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n Received : 17 March 2011 / Accepted : 19 August 2011 / Published online : 1 September 2011 (cid:2) Springer - Verlag 2011 Abstract This review describes a case of convergence in the evolution of brain and cognition . Both mammals and birds can organize their behavior ﬂexibly over time and evolved similar cognitive skills . The avian forebrain dis - plays no lamination that corresponds to the mammalian neocortex ; hence , lamination does not seem to be a requirement for higher cognitive functions . In mammals , executive functions are associated with the prefrontal cor - tex . The corresponding structure in birds is the nidopallium caudolaterale . Anatomic , neurochemical , electrophysio - logic and behavioral studies show these structures to be highly similar , but not homologous . Thus , despite the presence ( mammals ) or the absence ( birds ) of a laminated forebrain , ‘prefrontal’ areas in mammals and birds con - verged over evolutionary time into a highly similar neural architecture . The neuroarchitectonic degrees of freedom to create different neural architectures that generate identical prefrontal functions seem to be very limited . Convergent evolution of brain and behavior Organisms change during the process of evolution by modiﬁcations of already existing organisms . When a spe - cies splits into two new ones , the two groups of descen - dants share many common features . They usually can easily be recognized as being relatives due to common characteristics of their morphology and their behavior . Also the various groups of animals that are the further descendants of these two species retain a number of the shared features that reﬂect their common heritage . If a shared trait of two species can be traced back to a common ancestor without interruption , we have a case of homology . The eyes of vertebrates are such a case : Despite all dif - ferences that can be seen between the eyes of , say , a coral snake and a human , it is possible to show that indeed the eyes of snakes and humans derive from a common ancestor that lived nearly 300 million years ago and that already possessed a similar eye structure ( Gehring , 2005 ) . At ﬁrst glance , the eyes of octopus might also look very similar to the human eye : it is constituted by a lens that functions identically to that of humans ; it has a vitreous humor and a retina that resemble ours in several aspects . But human and octopus eyes share no common ancestor . Thus , the last common ancestor of humans and octopus had no eyes that are comparable with the condition in each of these lines of animals . The similarity of the eyes of octopus and humans is , therefore , due to convergent evolution . Convergent evolution describes the acquisition of the same biologic trait in unrelated lineages of organisms due to a similar selection pressure . Convergent evolution can explain how the selection pressure for excellent object vision in the lines leading to humans and octopus caused a similar series of changes that then resulted in a similar design of the eye ( Wake , Wake , & Specht , 2011 ) . Thus , in the two lineages of life which led to humans and octopus , a similar eye was invented twice because both lineages needed it . During the evolutionary time not only bodies are subject to change , but also behavior and cognitive skills . There - fore , we can see convergent evolution also in the realm of behavioral traits . For example , some Tetragnatha spiders of the Hawaiian Archipelago have independently evolved similar web building behaviors due to a common selection pressure in comparable ecological niches ( Blackledge & O . Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n ( & ) Department of Biopsychology , Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience , Faculty of Psychology , 44780 Bochum , Germany e - mail : onur . guentuerkuen @ rub . de 123 Psychological Research ( 2012 ) 76 : 212 – 219 DOI 10 . 1007 / s00426 - 011 - 0377 - 9 Author ' s personal copy Gillespie , 2004 ) . Since the behavior is organized by neural structures , it is possible that also the brains of these spider species have converged at certain levels . But what exactly happens in the brains when two groups of animals con - verge with respect to their cognitive skills ? Do their brains then also assume a very similar neural architecture ? Or are differently organized brains able to produce the same kind of cognitive output ? In the following , a case of convergent evolution of cognitive skills between mammals and birds will be discussed . I will ﬁrst show how similar the cogni - tive capabilities of these two classes of vertebrates are ( Kirsch , Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , & Rose , 2008 ) and then outline the neural structures that enable these skills ( Rose , Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , & Kirsch , 2009 ) . Behavioral skills of birds and mammals The class of mammals to which we belong is phyloge - netically very successful . Mammals spread over the whole world and captured most ecological niches . In virtually every niche , mammals represent top predators . This suc - cess story is , at least in part , due to the ability of mam - mals to adjust their behavior ﬂexibly to changing demands . Mammals like humans , macaques or rats are quickly able to learn new behavioral choices and abandon old ones ; they successfully select appropriate responses according to contextual information and withhold actions until a suitable situation occurs ( Allen & Bekoff , 1997 ) . In short , they optimally organize their behavior over time . Birds represent an about equally successful vertebrate class and a vast literature testiﬁes that birds are able to generate many of the same cognitive functions as mam - mals ( Emery & Clayton , 2004 ) . Corvids like the European magpie are able to recognize themselves in the mirror ( Prior et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 1 ) , and have an understanding of object permanence similar to humans ( Pollok , Prior , & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 2000 ) . Other corvids like blue jays display episodic - like memory ( Clayton , Bussey , & Dickinson , 2003 ) , and crows demonstrate behavior that resembles theory - of mind ( Bugnyar & Heinrich , 2005 ) , and show highly sophisticated ability for causal understanding in tool use ( Bird & Emery , 2009 ) . Even the lowly pigeon is able to memorize up to 725 different visual patterns ( Fersen & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 1990 ) , learns to categorize complex images ( Yamazaki , Aust , Huber , & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 2007 ) or ranks patterns using transitive inference logics ( Fersen von , Wynne , Delius , & Staddon , 1990 ) . The evolution of these abilities is an example of convergent evolution that enables birds and mammals to utilize a very similar repertoire of behavioral skills . These skills were not inherited from a common ancestor , however , but rather evolved independently ( Jarvis et al . , 2005 ) . Neuroarchitecture of birds and mammals Although mammals and birds are highly similar at the behavioral level , their evolutionary lines separated nearly 300 million years ago . Due to this great evolutionary dis - tance , the anatomic organizations of their forebrains differ substantially . The most notable difference is the lack of a laminated cortex in the avian telencephalon ( Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 2005 ) . In recent years , our understanding of the evolution of vertebrate brains and the homologies between the avian and the mammalian brains has advanced substantially . To reﬂect this new understanding , the Avian Brain Nomen - clature Consortium , a group of leading experts in the ﬁeld , has proposed a radically new view on the homologies Fig . 1 Self - recognition in the mirror in magpies . a Magpie with a mark in the throat region ; b , c schematic depictions of focus movements toward the throat which were counted as attempts to remove the mark . Based on Prior , Schwarz , and Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n ( 2008 ) Psychological Research ( 2012 ) 76 : 212 – 219 213 123 Author ' s personal copy between the avian and the mammalian brains ( Reiner et al . , 2004 ) . The classical view on the avian brain dated back to the 1900s and it was based on Edinger ’ s model of brain evolution ( Edinger , Wallenberg & Holmes , 1903 ) . According to his formulation , the vertebrate brain evolu - tion consisted of a series of additions of new brain entities , with the mammalian neocortex being the last and the most advanced step . In mammals , the cortex constitutes the largest part of the forebrain pallium . The mammalian pal - lium mainly follows a laminar organization , whereas the avian pallium is organized in nuclei . The absence of a laminated component within the avian forebrain led Lud - wig Edinger to assume that birds have virtually no pallium , but an enormously hypertrophied striatum instead . Based on neurochemical , histologic , behavioral , embryological and genetic studies , this view is meanwhile rejected ( Reiner et al . , 2004 ) . Birds do indeed possess a large pal - lium , but this pallium is not laminated . In Fig . 1 , a monkey and a pigeon forebrains are shown with the subpallium ( mostly basal ganglia ) highlighted differently . It is obvious that pigeons have a large pallium that stretches above the subpallium ( Fig . 2 ) . At ﬁrst glance , we have a case of cognitive , but not of neural convergent evolution : birds and mammals have independently evolved highly similar cognitive skills , but achieve these abilities with vastly different forebrain architectures : while mammalian pallium is laminated that of birds is not . In the following , we will see that this is too simple a view . I will outline that the evolution of mam - malian and avian forebrains differs in lamination , but shows remarkable similarities in their allometric properties , as well as in the microarchitecture of their associative pallial structures . Allometry : big brains for smart animals Allometry is the study of the relationship between the size of an animal and the size of any of its parts , for example its brain . Animals with bigger bodies have bigger brains ( Jerison , 1979 ) . A large number of studies also show that higher cognitive abilities correlate with relatively larger brain sizes in mammals ( Harvey & Krebs , 1990 ) . For example , social learning , innovation , and tool use are all positively correlated with large brain size across primate species ( Reader & Laland , 2002 ) . Similarly , Deaner , van Schaik , and Johnson ( 2006 ) also found a similar trend of positive correlations over primate genera for up to 30 dif - ferent cognitive tests . The very same is true for birds . Here , innovation rate , tool use , and reversal learning are posi - tively correlated with larger pallial brain sizes ( Lefebvre , Reader , & Sol , 2004 ) . Also , brain size facilitates survival in novel regions of the world in birds ( Sol , Duncan , Black - burn , Cassey , & Lefebvre , 2005 ) and mammals ( Lefebvre & Sol , 2008 ) . Large brains can result from a mosaic - like pattern of selective relative growth of brain components ( Iwaniuk , Dean , & Nelson , 2004 ) . In song birds , brain growth is mainly driven by an increase of the pallium . Especially , corvids with their impressive cognitive skills possess much larger associative pallial areas than other birds ( Rehka¨mper , Frahm , & Zilles , 1991 ) . Among corvids , especially New Caledonian crows dis - play extraordinary skills in making and using an impressive range of tools ( Hunt & Gray , 2003 ) . They also are able to bend unfamiliar material like wire into functional tools ( Weir , Chappell , & Kacelnik , 2002 ) , can use one tool to get another ( metatool use ) ( Taylor , Hunt , Holzhaider , & Gray , 2007 ) , and solve complex physical cognition tasks that Fig . 2 Comparison of the forebrain organization of representatives of mammals and birds . a Magniﬁcation of the primary visual cortex of the macaque .

Note the absence of a clear lamination 214 Psychological Research ( 2012 ) 76 : 212 – 219 123 Author ' s personal copy require causal and analogic reasoning ( Taylor , Hunt , Medina , & Gray , 2009 ) that rival those of apes ( Emery & Clayton , 2004 ) . New Caledonian crows have one of the largest avian brains for their body size ( Cnotka , Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , Rehka¨mper , Gray & Hunt , 2008 ) . In fact , their relative brain / body - ratio ( not their encephalization ) is higher than that of humans ( Cnotka et al . , 2008 ) . More interestingly , the relative size of their associative forebrain and their striatopallidal complex is disproportionally enlarged ( Mehlhorn , Rehka¨mper , Hunt , Gray , & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 2010 ) . This is also the case for primates : they also display an over proportionally enlarged associative forebrain and striatum compared with other non - primate mammals ( Stephan , Baron , & Frahm , 1988 ; Rehka¨mper et al . , 1991 ; Keverne , Martel , & Nevison , 1996 ; Barton & Harvey , 2000 ; Sol , Bacher , Reader , & Lefebvre , 2008 ) . These data from corvids , in general , and New Caledonian crows , in special , reveal an important insight into the evo - lution of cognitive functions : despite a radically different structure of the pallium ( laminated vs . non - laminated ) , an evolutionary increase of cognitive skills goes along with a volume increase of associative forebrain structures and their striatal termination ﬁelds . In other words , the enlargement of associative forebrain structures seems to be the default option in the evolution of high - cognitive skills like selective and sustained attention , categorization , episodic memory , spatial cognition , tool use , prospection , social cognition , problem solving , and self - recognition . The avian ‘‘Prefrontal Cortex’’ To date , I discussed the allometric properties of associative forebrain structures of mammals and birds with respect to differences of cognitive skills among taxa . In the following , I will focus on the microarchitecture of one of the associative forebrain areas . The focus structure in mammals will be the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) . The PFC is ﬁrmly associated with the generation of executive functions , a cluster of cognitive functions that describe the ability to spontaneously generate efﬁcient strategies when relying on self - directed task - spe - ciﬁc planning . The functional equivalent of the PFC is the avian nidopallium caudolaterale ( NCL ) Hartmann and Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n ( 1998 ) ( Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 2005 ; Kirsch et al . , 2008 ) . As outlined below , NCL and PFC are the crucial structures in the mediation of executive functions and share a large number of anatomic , physiologic , and functional similarities ( Fig . 3 ) . The PFC of mammals is densely innervated by dopa - minergic ﬁbers from the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra . This dopaminergic innervation was usu - ally taken as a characterizing element of the PFC ; but the NCL is also densely innervated by dopaminergic ﬁbers from the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra ( Wynne & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 1995 ) . Additionally , the architec - ture of the dopaminergic terminals within the NCL closely resembles that of the PFC ( Schnabel et al . , 1997 ; Durste - witz , Kro¨ner , Hemmings Jr , & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n 1998 ; Metzger , Jiang , & Braun , 2002 ) . The NCL is also comparable with the PFC in that it is a center of higher - order sensory inte - gration . Sensory input reaches the NCL via a set of inter - connected pathways that show a considerable overlap of different modalities ( Kro¨ner & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 1999 ) . In addition , the NCL projects to most parts of the somatic and limbic striatum , as well as to motor output structures that then project to brainstem areas that process incoming sensory information ( Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n & Remy , 1990 ) . Thus , identically to PFC , the avian NCL is a convergence zone between the ascending sensory and the descending motor systems . In addition , the NCL and PFC resemble each other in terms of their connections with the amygdala , nucleus accumbens , visceral structures , and diverse chemically deﬁned afferent systems ( Kro¨ner & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 1999 ) . Thus , a comparison of the anatomic network deﬁning the NCL and PFC shows a large number of sim - ilarities with only a few differences . As the PFC , the avian NCL is a multimodal forebrain area , located at the con - vergence zone from sensation to action , is modulated by dopaminergic ﬁbers and tightly interrelated with structures serving limbic , visceral , and memory - related functions ( Rose et al . , 2009 ) .

The pigeon brain in the lower middle part of the ﬁgure is to the same scale as the human brain . Based on Gu ¨ ntu ¨ rku ¨ n ( 2005 ) Psychological Research ( 2012 ) 76 : 212 – 219 215 123 Author ' s personal copy The cellular machinery for working memory in birds and mammals Working memory is a critical component of executive functions and it has been deﬁned in parallel and rather independently in pigeons and humans . The ‘human’ ( Baddeley & Hitch , 1974 ) and the ‘pigeon’ deﬁnitions of working memory ( Honig , 1978 ) differ only with respect to the presence of a language - component in humans . Not only is working memory very similar between mammals and birds , but , as outlined below , also the neural processes generating working memory seem to be identical in both orders . During delay periods of working memory tasks , a memory trace of the relevant information has to be held active . PFC neurons in macaques ( Machens , Romo , & Brody , 2005 ) and NCL neurons in pigeons ( Diekamp , Kalt , & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 2002a ; Browning , Bruce Overmier , & Colombo , 2011 ) display a sustained activity during delay that possibly hold online a memory trace for the subsequent response or an expected outcome associated with each sample . If this activity within NCL breaks down , the ani - mal is likely to err ( Rose & Colombo , 2005 ) . Conse - quently , PFC - lesions in rats ( Dunnett , Nathwani , & Brasted , 1999 ) and NCL - lesions in pigeons ( Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 1997 ; Diekamp , Gagliardo , & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 2002b ) always disrupt delay - task performance . Delay time - speciﬁc activations of PFC neurons are modulated by the dopaminergic system via D1 - receptors ( Sawaguchi , 2001 ; Vijayraghavan , Wang , Birnbaum , Williams , & Arnsten , 2007 ) . Consequently , blockade of dopaminergic D1 - receptors in the NCL of pigeons ( Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n & Durstewitz , 2001 ) or the PFC of macaques ( Sawaguchi & Goldman - Rakic , 1991 ) disrupts working memory performance . Possibly , dopamine stabilizes active prefrontal neural representations against interfering input ( Durstewitz , Kelc , & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 1999 ) by altering ionic and synaptic conductances which enhance spike frequen - cies of preactivated assemblies ( Durstewitz , Seamans , & Sejnowski , 2000 ; Seamans , Durstewitz , Christie , Stevens , & Sejnowski , 2001 ) . Thus , dopamine release in PFC / NCL could result in self - sustained activity being more robust to distracting stimuli and keeping the system focused on a particular goal state ( Durstewitz et al . , 1999 ) . The cellular properties for these effects were described in mammals ( Seamans & Yang , 2004 ) and they are likely to also exist in a similar way in pigeons ( Kro¨ner , Gottmann , Hatt , & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 2002 ) . For dopamine to play a stabilizing role in working memory , it has to be released during delay tasks . Indeed , both in monkeys ( Watanabe , Kodama , & Hikosaka , 1997 ) and pigeons ( Karakuyu , Herold , Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , & Diekamp , 2007 ) , an increase of dopamine efﬂux in PFC and NCL , respectively , has been observed in working memory tasks . Neurochemical studies show that dopamine release in the PFC favors a diffusion - mediated volume transmission . This characteristic sluggishness of dopamine - reuptake within the PFC probably plays a key role in integrating stimulus - driven input and dopamine release : when dopa - mine is only slowly removed from extracellular space and thus spreads far from its release site , its presence is less precise with respect to time and synaptic location . As a consequence , it enables associative forebrain structures to easily integrate stimulus - driven events and dopamine releases ( Schultz , 1998 ) . Thus , volume transmission rep - resents a key feature of the dopaminergic control of pre - frontal functions . An in vivo microdialysis study of the extracellular values of dopamine and its metabolites within the pigeon’s NCL revealed indeed a volume transmission mode ( Bast , Diekamp , Thiel , Schwarting , & Gu¨ntu¨rku¨n , 2002 ) : Dopamine release in the NCL was associated with a lower reuptake by the dopamine transporter and could correspondingly accumulate in extracellular space . Thus , the mode of dopamine - utilization was identical in the mammalian PFC and the avian NCL . Taken together , the mammalian PFC and the avian NCL show an astonishing degree of structural , cellular , and biochemical resemblances in the neuronal mechanisms with which the working memory is generated . Since the whole pallium is homologous between mammals and birds ( Reiner et al . , 2004 ) , does this mean that also the PFC and NCL are homologous pallial ﬁelds ? Probably not . Based on topographic and genetic arguments ( Puelles et al . , 2000 ; Medina & Reiner , 2000 ) , PFC and NCL are possibly not homologous as pallial ﬁelds , but represent a case of evo - lutionary convergence . Thus , non - homologous ﬁelds within a homologous pallium converged over 300 million years into a mammalian and an avian version of a pre - frontal entity to subserve highly similar functions . In the end , both areas acquired highly similar cellular properties to generate working memory . This evolutionary scenario offers a sobering lesson : there seem to be the only limited degrees of freedom to generate neural structures for cog - nitive operations like working memory . Concluding remarks Function before form Birds and mammals have independently evolved the highest cognitive skills . Within the class of mammals , it is the primate order that stands out in cognitive terms . Within the class of birds , corvids and parrots take a similar posi - tion . Comparative cognitive analyses show that especially corvids reach cognitive skills that are on par with apes . 216 Psychological Research ( 2012 ) 76 : 212 – 219 123 Author ' s personal copy Despite these similarities in cognitive terms , birds and mammals have vastly different organized forebrains . Although their pallia are homologous , the mammalian dorsal pallium ( cortex ) is laminated while that of birds is not . Thus , lamination cannot be a structural requirement for the highest cognitive abilities . Big brains for smart creatures Both for birds and mammals , cognitive skills go along with an increase in brain size . This increase is especially evident in the associative areas of the pallium and their striatal termination ﬁelds . Thus , cognition needs associative space , irrespective how the brain is organized otherwise . The more cognitive ﬂexibility is required for an animal , the larger its associative pallium has to grow . Limited degrees of freedom Avian and mammalian pallia are homologous as a whole entity , but this does not necessarily hold for one - to - one comparisons between different pallial ﬁelds ( areas ) . PFC and NCL of mammals and birds , respectively , are both key ﬁelds for the generation of executive functions , but PFC and NCL are very likely not homologous . But despite this evolutionary difference , these two structures show an astonishing degree of similarity in terms of connectivity , neurochemistry , function , and electrophysiology . These similarities are most evident in the case of stimulus maintenance , as required for the short - term memory com - ponent of working memory . Thus , the establishment of certain cognitive operations seems to require a certain neural microcircuit . Even in forebrains that importantly differ in terms of the presence or the absence of a lami - nated architecture , there seem to be very limited degrees of freedom in establishing different microcircuits for identical cognitive operations .
