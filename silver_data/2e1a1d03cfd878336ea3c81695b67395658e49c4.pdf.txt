More recently , physiological roles for ROS in cellular signalling have been described . These include the control of cell proliferation , differentiation and metabolism , regulat - ing stem - cell quiescence and cell - fate commitment . Similarly , ROS influence wound healing in zebrafish , including fin and skin inner - vation , whole body regeneration in planarians as well as neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons and cell lines 3 – 14 . Cells produce ROS through NADPH oxidases ( NOXs ) , mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation , xanthine oxidase , cyclooxygenases , cytochrome p450 enzymes and lipoxygenases . NOXs mediate redox signal - ling through direct reversible oxidation of proteins on cysteine or methionine residues 15 , 16 . The specific ROS that is produced , their amount , half - life and diffusion distance as well as the intracellular localization dictate their biological outcomes 17 . Neurons have a high metabolic demand with substantial oxygen and ATP consumption . Additionally , the long axonal and dendritic processes require compart - mentalized signalling , and transportation of molecules and organ - elles across long distances , including during axonal development and regeneration following a lesion 18 , 19 . ROS may be ideally suited to meet these signalling needs , especially after an injury after which an inflammatory response surrounds the axon and increases the local level of oxidants . Interestingly , tissue repair after injury , including heart or brain ischaemia as well as spinal cord damage , can be increased by a pre - vious subclinical injury , the so - called conditioning lesion , which enhances survival , regeneration and functional recovery 20 – 22 . The conditioning nerve injury paradigm is well - described by the axonal regeneration that follows a spinal injury when this is associated with a sciatic nerve lesion 23 , 24 . Soon after a lesion , injured axons experience an inflammation - dependent extremely oxidative environment that contributes to the initial growth cone collapse and retraction , which occurs via ROS - dependent oxidation of actin by MICAL proteins that produce superoxide 25 . However , because ROS are known to participate in cellular signalling , including tissue repair , we hypothesized that an axonal injury triggering inflammation would release ROS that affect axonal signalling , potentially supporting the regenerative program after nerve injury and a conditioning lesion . Results ROS are required for neurite outgrowth and axonal regenera - tion of sensory neurons . We hypothesized that damage to dor - sal root ganglia ( DRG ) neurons generates ROS and causes redox stress , after which ROS signalling supports axonal regeneration , Reactive oxygen species regulate axonal regeneration through the release of exosomal NADPH oxidase 2 complexes into injured axons Arnau Hervera 1 , 2 , Francesco De Virgiliis 1 , 3 , 4 , Ilaria Palmisano 1 , Luming Zhou 3 , Elena Tantardini 1 , Guiping Kong 3 , Thomas Hutson 1 , Matt C .

Shah 7 , Mike Fainzilber 6 and Simone Di Giovanni 1 , 3 * Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) contribute to tissue damage and remodelling mediated by the inflammatory response after injury . Here we show that ROS , which promote axonal dieback and degeneration after injury , are also required for axonal regen - eration and functional recovery after spinal injury . We find that ROS production in the injured sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia requires CX3CR1 - dependent recruitment of inflammatory cells . Next , exosomes containing functional NADPH oxidase 2 complexes are released from macrophages and incorporated into injured axons via endocytosis . Once in axonal endosomes , active NOX2 is retrogradely transported to the cell body through an importin - β 1 – dynein - dependent mechanism . Endosomal NOX2 oxidizes PTEN , which leads to its inactivation , thus stimulating PI3K – phosporylated ( p - ) Akt signalling and regenerative outgrowth . Challenging the view that ROS are exclusively involved in nerve degeneration , we propose a previously unrecog - nized role of ROS in mammalian axonal regeneration through a NOX2 – PI3K – p - Akt signalling pathway . © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

NATuRE CELL BIoLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CEll BIOlOgy including after a sciatic ‘regenerative’ conditioning lesion that pre - cedes a ‘non - regenerative’ central spinal injury . Therefore , we first assessed fluorescence of oxidized dihydroethidium ( DHE ) as a sur - rogate marker of redox stress and local ROS production ex vivo in DRGs , spinal cord and sciatic nerve after injury . DHE fluorescence increased within 2 h after sciatic nerve injury near the injury site and 1 mm below the outer rim of the spinal cord injury site ( Fig . 1a , e ) , and the signal was detectable in DRGs 12 h after sciatic , but not spinal , injury ( Fig . 1f – i , p ) . This increase lasted up to 24 h after the injury to return to baseline at later time points ( three and seven day timepoints ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . Application of N - acetyl - cysteine ( NAC ) , an oxidant scavenger that modulates redox tone , to the nerve injury site immediately before crush blocked the increase in DHE signal in both the nerve ( Fig . 1c ) and DRGs at all assessed time points ( Fig . 1m – o , q , Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . Additionally , redox stress induced by administration of H 2 O 2 to an uninjured nerve increased DHE fluorescence to similar levels as seen with nerve injury ( Fig . 1j – l , q ) . These data show that the level of DHE fluorescence is increased not only locally in the proximity of the site of tissue injury , but also proximally in DRGs , only after a regen - erative ( sciatic nerve ) but not after a non - regenerative ( spinal cord ) lesion . To support the specificity of these findings , we validated the increase in ROS levels with a hydrocyanine – Cy3 probe , which is a pan - ROS probe . We also inhibited ROS with the non - selective inhibitor of ROS - producing flavoenzymes , diphenyleneiodonium ( DPI ) . Indeed , DPI produced comparable results to those obtained with DHE and NAC ( Supplementary Fig . 1c , d ) . Next , we measured axon outgrowth in cultured DRGs after administration of H 2 O 2 to the sciatic nerve or after a conditioning sciatic lesion combined with NAC administration or vehicle . We found that neurite outgrowth induced by a conditioning lesion was blocked by administration of NAC immediately before crush , which was phenocopied by admin - istration of H 2 O 2 into the sciatic nerve ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . However , mitochondrial ROS scavenging at the site of the crush did not affect DRG outgrowth ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . Next , we analysed whether ROS originating from the axon are sufficient for DRG outgrowth . We cultured DRGs in microfluidic chambers separating the axons from the cell bodies and adminis - tered either H 2 O 2 or vehicle in the axonal compartment . Indeed , administration of H 2 O 2 in the micromolar range to axons was suf - ficient to increase neurite outgrowth ( Supplementary Fig . 2c , d ) , whereas higher concentrations ( 1 mM ) did not , which are likely to reflect toxic levels . We then investigated whether ROS - induced changes in the neural redox state were required for nerve regenera - tion by first using axotomy and re - anastomosis , a clinically relevant model of sciatic nerve injury that allows partial regeneration 26 . We found that NAC delivered to the sciatic nerve at the time of axotomy and re - anastomosis substantially inhibited regeneration ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Indeed , in line with the ex vivo and the nerve regeneration experi - ments , delivery of NAC inhibited conditioning - dependent axonal regrowth into the spinal lesion site , whereas H 2 O 2 reduced axonal dieback and promoted growth past the lesion site , mimicking the conditioning effect , which was assessed at two weeks after injury ( Fig . 2c – e ) . Similarly , administration of H 2 O 2 onto the sciatic nerve resulted in significantly increased regenerative outgrowth in cul - tured DRGs ( Supplementary Fig . 2e , f ) . Importantly , we found that H 2 O 2 conditioning preceding a spinal cord injury induces a faster and more pronounced recovery of function compared to vehicle - treated mice ( Fig . 2f – h ) . Together , these data show that the redox state is altered in DRGs after a regenerative nerve lesion and that non - mitochondrial ROS sources are necessary and sufficient for axonal outgrowth and regeneration of sensory axons . NOX signalling is needed for redox - dependent DRG outgrowth and axonal regeneration .

NATuRE CELL BIoLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CEll BIOlOgy nerve and spinal cord injury . Similarly , we used the sciatic nerve axotomy ( SNA ) group that was treated with NAC to exclude genes that were differentially regulated by SNA and H 2 O 2 that did not change after inhibition of redox signalling . Gene expression analy - sis showed that genes and pathways expected to be controlled by injury and redox signalling were indeed differentially regulated in each experimental condition . Finally , we selected genes that were differentially regulated both by SNA and H 2 O 2 , but that were not similarly differentially expressed after either SNA and NAC or DCA . Analysis of sciatic nerve injury - specific changes showed that although most injury - related genes were shared by NAC and vehicle ( Fig . 3b , c , Supplementary Table 1 ) , NAC - associated genes were also present ( Fig . 3c , 2 , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Whereas inflammation - related signalling was induced after peripheral injury and H 2 O 2 ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 3d , e , Supplementary Tables 2 , 3 ) , a central spinal injury showed much less prominent inflammatory changes in DRGs ( Supplementary Tables 1 – 3 ) . Interestingly , in addition to the expected increase in inflammatory genes , a number of regen - eration - associated transcripts were induced by both sciatic nerve injury and by H 2 O 2 , including SPRR1a , galanin receptor , ATF3 , GADD45a , JUN , KLF6 and MYC , which suggests that H 2 O 2 mimics certain aspects of a conditioning lesion . Signalling pathways and biological processes related to injury - dependent nerve regeneration were reduced with the addition of NAC at the time of sciatic injury compared to vehicle . This included neurotrophin – Trk , cAMP , STAT3 , calcium - signalling , interleu - kin ( IL - ) 10 , IL - 6 and PI3K – MAPK – ERK - dependent pathways ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 3d ) . Interestingly , injury and ROS - dependent pathways that were overrepresented included factors that are activated by inflammatory chemokines , support integrin - mediated transendothelial migra - tion , endo - and exocytosis , as well as PI3K and MAPK , which are all influenced by and converge on NOX signalling 27 ( Fig . 3f and Supplementary Tables 2 – 4 ) . NOX enzymes are major sources of ROS , with the membrane - bound NOX2 complex typically coupling inflammatory stimula - tion with intracellular signalling cascades . We used a quantitative high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) - based assay to investigate whether NOX - derived superoxide was increased after nerve injury via quantification of 2 - hydroxyethidine ( EOH ) . We found that both membrane - bound superoxide generation and overall superoxide levels were significantly increased in DRGs after nerve injury in wild - type mice , but not in Ncf1 − / − mice that lack Ncf1 , which encodes p47phox , an essential subunit of the NOX2 complex ( Fig . 3g , h ) . Importantly , delivery of the pan - NOX inhibitor VAS2870 28 at the site of a sciatic nerve injury blocked DRG neurite outgrowth that was induced by a conditioning lesion ( Fig . 3i , j ) , suggesting that NOX signalling may be required for nerve injury - dependent DRG outgrowth . p47phox expression depends on CX3CR1 after nerve injury and is required for oxidative signalling in DRGs , neurite out - growth and axonal regeneration . The NOX2 complex translates inflammatory signals into increases in superoxide , and the assem - bly of the oxidase , a prerequisite for NOX activation , requires the phosphorylation - dependent membrane translocation of its cyto - solic subunits , p47phox . Although RNA - seq data did not show changes in mRNA of NOX components after sciatic injury , we found marked upregulation of p47phox and the active form , phos - phorylated ( p - ) p47phox , as well as the catalytic subunit , gp91phox , within 2 h after nerve injury ( Supplementary Figs . 3a – f and 4a , b ) . This upregulation extended along the axon , to reach the DRG by 6 h after injury ( Supplementary Fig . 3h – j ) , whereas p47phox expression was very low in the absence of injury ( Supplementary Fig . 3g – i ) . Importantly , as expected after a tissue injury , we found that p - p47phox was expressed in CD11b + inflammatory cells near the lesion site ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . p - p47phox expression was also present in ICAM + endothelial cells lining the nerve after injury ( Supplementary Fig . 3c – f ) . In line with the lack of an increase in DHE fluorescence after a central spinal injury ( Fig . 1 ) , levels of p - p47phox were increased until the dorsal root entry zone , but not in the nerve or DRGs ( Supplementary Fig . 4c – e ) . However , p - p47phox was increased in the proximity of the spinal injury ( Supplementary Fig . 5a – h ) , which suggests that there is a differ - ence in retrograde signalling between the peripheral and central DRG branches . We hypothesized that disruption of NOX2 signalling by dele - tion of the p47phox ( Ncf1 ) subunit would impair ROS - dependent neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration . Unlike wild - type lit - termates , Ncf1 − / − mice 29 did not display conditioning - dependent DRG outgrowth ex vivo ( Fig . 4a , b ) and they exhibited reduced axo - nal regeneration after SNA followed by re - anastomosis ( Fig . 4c , d ) , phenocopying what was observed after delivery of NAC ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Furthermore , DRGs from Ncf1 − / − mice did not display the increase in DHE fluorescence after sciatic injury seen in DRGs from wild - type mice ( Fig . 4e , f ) . The fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 , which showed significantly increased expression after H 2 O 2 treatment in the RNA - seq data ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , is a chemo - attractant for leukocytes and macrophages after nerve injury - induced ROS and therefore a can - didate for oxidase activation that supports DRG outgrowth after injury . We thus investigated whether deletion of Cx3cr1 impaired post - injury expression of p - p47phox as prerequisite of NOX2 acti - vation and DRG neurite outgrowth . Indeed , mice lacking CX3CR1 displayed reduced p - p47phox expression in the nerve and DRGs ( Supplementary Fig . 6a – c ) and impaired ex vivo neurite outgrowth after a conditioning injury ( Supplementary Fig . 6d , e ) . However , we found no difference in neuronal number and survival between wild - type and Cx3cr1 – / – or Ncf1 – / – mice . Axonal NOX2 originates from immune cells and is retrogradely transported in axonal endosomes after injury depending upon importin - β 1 and dynein . The temporal and spatial distribution of p47phox protein expression and its dependence on CX3CR1 suggest that NOX2 enters axons from extrinsic cells , such as mac - rophages , which are recruited and activated after nerve injury . To test this hypothesis , we cultured DRGs from wild - type , Ncf1 − / − , or Nox2 − / − ( also known as Cybb − / − or Gp91phox − / − ) mice in micro - fluidic chambers separating cell bodies from neurites , in the pres - ence or absence of Ncf1 − / − , Nox2 − / − or wild - type activated bone marrow - derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) in the axonal compart - ment . Co - culture with wild - type , but not Ncf1 − / − or Nox2 − / − , macrophages led to increased neurite outgrowth compared to neurons without macrophages ( Fig . 5a , b ) . However , when Ncf1 − / − or Nox2 − / − DRGs were co - cultured with wild - type BMDMs , increased neurite outgrowth was maintained , suggesting that macrophage NOX2 and / or p47phox is required for neurite out - growth ( Fig . 5a , b ) . We then transfected BMDMs with a plasmid containing GFP - tagged , wild - type or constitutively active NOX2 - mutant p47phox 30 and plated them in the DRG axonal compart - ment in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore or vehicle . Although wild - type p47phox does not modify outgrowth compared to the GFP empty vector , we found that delivery of con - stitutively active p47phox increases neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 5c ) . Importantly , p47phox localization in DRGs and outgrowth were strongly inhibited when endocytosis was blocked by the dynamin inhibitor dynasore ( Fig . 5c , Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . Dynasore , however , did not affect cell survival , as the number of pyknotic nuclei and apoptotic bodies did not differ between dynasore ( 6 . 37 ± 1 . 2 % ) and vehicle ( 4 . 26 ± 0 . 97 % ) treatment ( P > 0 . 05 , Student’s t - test , n = 6 independent experiments ) . p47phox is expressed in BMDMs ( Supplementary Fig . 7B ) and is translocated © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

NATuRE CELL BIoLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CEll BIOlOgy to axons and cell bodies of DRGs ( Fig . 5d , e ) , where it localizes mainly in RAB7 + ( 96 . 0 ± 1 . 18 % of p47phox + RAB7 + double - posi - tive vesicles ; Fig . 5d , e ) and TRK ( 94 . 9 % ± 0 . 76 of p47phox + TRK + double - positive vesicles ) signalling endosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . Importantly , when we incubated BMDM - conditioned medium from macrophages previously transfected with GFP or NCF1 – GFP in the axonal compartment of cultured DRGs in the presence of dynasore , the internalization of p47phox – GFP in neu - rites was strongly reduced compared to vehicle ( Supplementary Fig . 7d – f ) . As expected and in line with these findings , dyna - sore inhibited endocytosis of fluorescently labelled transferrin ( Supplementary Fig . 7g ) . Together , these experiments suggest that the NOX2 complex originates from activated macrophages and enters axons by endocytosis , where it localizes to neuronal endosomes and is required for stimulation of DRG outgrowth . Indeed , we found that BMDMs produce extracellular vesicles that are later internalized into the neuron via endocytic pathways , as shown by the ability of BMDMs to generate extracellular vesicles after incubation with the membrane dye PKH67 ( Supplementary Fig . 8h ) . These extracellular vesicles were then characterized after internalization and shown to express exosomal markers ( CD9 and CD63 ; Fig . 6 ) . Next , we found that wild - type , but not Nox2 − / − , exosomes exhibit NOX activity and superoxide production ( Fig . 5f ) and that delivery of wild - type , but not Ncf1 − / − or Nox2 − / − , purified exosomes or condi - tioned medium strongly promoted outgrowth ( Figs . 5g , h and 6a , b ) , suggesting that the NOX2 complex is required for exosome - depen - dent DRG outgrowth . We then confirmed the presence of an active complete NOX2 complex in activated BMDM - derived exosomes . We found the main components of the activated NOX2 complex : active ( GTP - bound ) RAC1 , p47phox , NOX2 ( that is , gp91phox ) , p22phox , p67phox and p - p47phox in exosomes from lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - activated BMDMs , which also expressed the exosome markers CD9 , CD63 and TSG101 ( Fig . 6c – f ) . However , our frac - tion was free of other membrane - derived organelles ( Fig . 6c – f ) . Additionally , we performed morphological and size character - ization of the purified fraction by transmission electron micros - copy ( Fig . 6g – j ) . The size and shape of vesicles that were isolated matched those described for exosomes ( 104 . 55 ± 6 . 92 nm , n = 53 vesicles from three independent fractions ) . We also deter - mined the presence of the NOX - subunit p22phox in CD63 + vesicles using double immunogold transmission electron microscopy ( Fig . 6g – j ) . To conclusively show the necessity of immune - derived NOX2 for axonal regeneration of sensory neurons , we performed sciatic nerve crush in Lysm - cre ; Nox2 fl / fl mice lacking NOX2 ( gp91phox ) specifi - cally in macrophages , as we have recently reported 31 . We found that three days after sciatic nerve crush the number of regenerating axons ( SCG10 + ) was strongly reduced in Lysm - cre ; NOX2 fl / fl mice compared to wild - type ( wild - type Nox2 fl / fl ) littermates , demon - strating that immune - derived NOX2 is required for sensory axonal regeneration ( Fig . 6k , l ) . 2 Next , we investigated where and how the NOX2 complex is transported within the axon from the injury site to the cell body . Confocal imaging showed that the active phosphorylated form of p47phox localizes in RAB7 + endosomes both in the nerve and DRG cell body after injury ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) . Importantly , when we administered the membrane - impermeable ROS dye Oxyburst - BSA to the lesion site at the time of injury , we observed that it localized in RAB7 + endosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 8c ) , suggesting an active ROS - producing state of the NOX2 complex in these organelles . Although p - p47phox + Rab7 + endosomes were more obvious in the proximity of the sciatic nerve injury early after injury ( 2 h ) , they could be seen at later time points ( 6 and 12 h ) as far away as the cell body ( at 20 mm from the lesion site ) , suggesting that they were ret - rogradely transported ( Supplementary Fig . 8d ) . Next , we investigated the role of axonal trafficking mechanisms in the transfer of the NOX2 complex from the injury site to the cell body . Given that axonal retrograde transport is mainly supported by dynein and associated cargo proteins , including importin - β 1 , we first tested the of the dynein inhibitor ciliobrevin D ( CbD ) in wild - type mice . We injected the sciatic nerve with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B ( CtB ) followed by CbD or vehicle injection imme - diately before sciatic nerve crush . Subsequent experiments used knockout mice carrying an axonal importin - β 1 deletion ( Impnb ( also known as Kpnb1 ) 3 ′ UTR − / − ) 32 to investigate whether this inhibited transport of activated NOX2 . Analysis of DHE + DRGs after crush demonstrated that the increase in oxidative signalling in DRGs and increase in p - p47phox levels in the axon and DRG of CbD - treated ( Fig . 7a – d ) or Impnb 3 ′ UTR − / − mice ( Fig . 7e – g ) is sig - nificantly reduced compared to control . Lastly , we found that CbD injection immediately before sciatic nerve crush reduced DRG out - growth compared to vehicle ( Fig . 7h , i ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the increase in NOX - dependent oxidative signalling in DRGs after nerve lesion depends on CX3CR1 and activated NOX2 derived from macrophages , and that the axonal retrograde trans - port machinery is required for transit of the NOX2 complex from the lesion site to the DRG cell body . Nerve injury - dependent oxidative signalling and NOX2 are required for PTEN oxidation and PI3K – p - Akt signalling in DRGs . To identify putative targets of NOX - induced signalling , we performed a KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes , http : / / www . genome . jp / kegg / pathway . html ) pathway analysis of dif - ferentially regulated genes from the RNA - seq experiment , by select - ing for pathways and transcription hubs that were enriched in the differentially regulated genes after SNA and / or H 2 O 2 treatment but not after SNA and NAC treatment . Next , we selected key regulatory proteins from these pathways for which activity can be regulated through cysteine ( Cys ) oxidation , leading to a short list of six pro - teins : two protein kinases ( SRC and SSH3 ) , two inositol phospha - tases ( IMPA1 and PTEN ) , and two protein phosphatase subunits ( PP1C and PPP1R12 ) . We then carried out biotin - tagging of oxi - dized Cys to measure differential protein oxidation after administra - tion of H 2 O 2 versus NAC or vehicle in differentiated F11 DRG - like cell lines . Of the six proteins tested , PTEN was the most differen - tially oxidized protein ( Fig . 8a , b ) , although H 2 O 2 did not change PTEN protein expression ( Fig . 8c , d ) . Therefore , we measured the oxidation state of PTEN in DRGs after sciatic injury . Notably , we found that PTEN was significantly oxidized in DRGs after sci - atic nerve injury ( Fig . 8e , f ) . We then investigated whether NOX2 oxidizes PTEN by measuring PTEN expression after labelling of oxidized Cys following overexpression of p47phox – GFP , a constitu - tively active p47phox mutant with S303D , S304D and S328D muta - tions ( p47phox3 × ) or of a control GFP plasmid . These analyses revealed that expression of constitutively active p47phox3 × led to the oxidation of PTEN ( Fig . 8g – i ) . Given that the NOX2 complex is highly expressed in axonal endosomes after injury ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , we investigated whether PTEN was found in sciatic nerve endosomes . Indeed , immunoblotting from RAB7 immunoisolated fractions showed that PTEN was present in endosomes along with NOX2 complex subunits p47phox , gp91phox and superoxide dis - mutase 1 , which converts superoxide to the biologically active H 2 O 2 ( Fig . 8j ) . Purity of the immunoisolated fraction was tested by immu - noblotting for proteins expressed by non - endosomal membrane organelles ( Supplementary Fig . 8e ) . Cys oxidation of PTEN leads to the formation of a disulfide bond with consequent enzymatic inactivation 33 . Because PTEN antagonizes the PI3K – Akt signal - ling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides , we assessed levels of phosphorylation of the PI3K target Akt after sciatic injury © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

We found that p - Akt expression was increased in wild - type but not in Ncf1 − / − DRGs after sciatic injury ( Fig . 8k , l ) . To test whether PI3K signalling was required for DRG outgrowth after nerve injury , we delivered LY294002 , a PI3K pharmacological inhibitor , in vivo at the time of sciatic injury in wild - type mice . LY294002 , which had no effect in uninjured mice , impaired the injury - dependent conditioning effect upon DRG outgrowth in wild - type mice , phenocopying deficient outgrowth observed in Ncf1 − / − mice ( Fig . 8m , n ) . Finally , in vivo inhibition of PTEN activity with the PTEN inhibitor SF1670 in wild - type and Ncf1 − / − mice stimulates DRG outgrowth similarly to a conditioning lesion and is able to overcome the lack of DRG outgrowth after con - ditioning lesion observed in Ncf1 − / − mice ( Fig . 8m , n ) . In summary , our findings demonstrate that an axonal injury trig - gers exosome - mediated release of an active NOX2 complex from activated macrophages ( Fig . 8o ) . NOX2 is subsequently incorpo - rated in endosomes and is retrogradely transported to the cell body ( Fig . 8o ) . Then , NOX2 causes oxidation - induced inactivation of PTEN , which enables activation of PI3K – p - Akt signalling and leads to DRG axonal outgrowth ( Fig . 8o ) . Discussion We describe a mechanism by which post - injury inflammatory sig - nals positively influence axonal oxidative signalling to promote axonal outgrowth and regeneration of sensory neurons . Moreover , H 2 O 2 sciatic conditioning preceding a spinal injury promotes recov - ery of function . H 2 O 2 mimics conditioning injury - dependent axo - nal regeneration as well as regenerative gene expression as shown by the induction of the expression of several classical regeneration - associated genes . Mechanistically , we found that after nerve injury , a CX3CR1 - dependent inflammatory response triggers the release of exosomes from macrophages that transfer the NOX2 complex into the axon via endocytosis . These findings introduce a class of signalling molecules that are essential for nerve regeneration , sug - gesting that post - injury axonal regeneration is not only supported by the classical immunomodulatory role of the immune cells , including macrophages 34 , 35 , but also that a CX3CR1 - dependent oxi - dative immune response is needed for the regenerative phenotype . Internalized axonal NOX2 leads to an increase in oxidative signal - ling that is in turn required for DRG neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration . NOX2 is retrogradely transported in RAB7 + axonal endosomes depending on the expression and activity of importin - β 1 and dynein in axons . Finally , NOX2 oxidizes PTEN , which down - regulates its activity and increases the activation of the PI3K – p - Akt pathway , which is required for DRG outgrowth and for regenerative reprogramming after nerve injury . As PTEN loss of function sub - stantially promotes axonal regeneration in the mammalian central nervous system 36 , 37 , our discovery of PTEN oxidation after nerve injury supports the central role of protein oxidation for the con - trol of nerve regeneration and provides a physiological post - injury context for the modulation of PTEN pathways . It has been shown that ROS and NOX oxidative signalling can be activated by intracel - lular signalling pathways , such as PI3K or MAPK 38 , and that NOX downstream signalling may affect the phosphorylation of several transcription factors 39 . However , how axonal ROS may specifi - cally affect phosphorylation cascades , including neurotrophins and transcription - dependent axonal regenerative signals , as well as how phosphorylation signals can activate NOX signalling after nerve injury remains unknown . Our results , which show that NOX2 acti - vates PI3K signalling via PTEN oxidation , might indicate the pres - ence of a positive feedback loop between PI3K and NOX2 , leading to the sustained activation of NOX2 to support a long - lasting axonal regeneration program . Our data also suggest caution in the use of indiscriminate anti - oxidant therapies after nerve injury , as these may hinder oxida - tive regenerative signalling and therefore limit nerve regeneration . Appropriate timing and level of ROS inhibition after injury will likely need to be tailored to provide maximal efficacy avoiding unwanted effects . An additional intriguing implication is the pos - sibility to modulate oxidative signalling to achieve axonal regen - eration and functional recovery following nerve and spinal injuries . Here , we also found lack of axonal transport of the NOX2 complex beyond the dorsal root entry zone as suggested by the fact that key components of the complex are not transported back from the spinal injury site to DRGs . This suggests that perturbed axonal transport of signalling molecules may underlie the differential regenerative ability conferred by a central versus a peripheral lesion . Further investigation and characterization of neuronal oxidative signalling elicited by nerve injury may increase our understand - ing of the molecular causes of regenerative failure and may enable the future design of therapeutic strategies to foster nerve regen - eration and functional recovery both in the central and peripheral nervous system .

For generation of Lysm - cre ; Nox2 fl / fl and littermate controls , Nox2 fl / fl females were crossed with male Lysm - cre transgenic mice as previously described 31 . Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane ( 3 % induction , 2 % maintenance ) and buprenorphine ( 0 . 1 mg kg − 1 ) and carprophen ( 5 mg kg − 1 ) was administered peri - operatively as analgesic . DCA . Surgeries were performed as previously reported 41 . In brief , mice were anaesthetized and a T9 laminectomy was performed ( approximately 20 mm from L4 – L6 DRGs ) , the dura mater was removed , taking care not to damage the spinal cord . A dorsal hemisection until the central canal was performed with fine forceps ( FST ) . For laminectomy surgery , the dura mater was removed but the dorsal hemisection was not performed . Sciatic nerve crush ( SNC ) and SNA . In brief , the biceps femoris and the gluteus superficialis were separated by blunt dissection , and the sciatic nerve was exposed . Sciatic injury was performed by crushing the nerve for 2 × 20 seconds orthogonally on the common segment of the nerve , approximately 20 mm distally from L4 – L6 DRGs . Alternatively to the crush , a sharp axotomy was performed . Sham - operated mice that underwent exposure of the sciatic nerve without crush or axotomy were used as surgery controls . Local delivery of compounds on the sciatic nerve . 2 . 5 µ l of each compound or its corresponding vehicle ( saline or dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) ) were slowly poured onto the nerve with a pipette to avoid damage to the nerve and allowed to penetrate the tissue for 20 s prior to performing the injury or suturing the wound . Lack of complete internalization of the administered compound and diffusion / spreading of it along the nerve dilute the administered stock concentration . Considering tissue swelling , we estimated that the actual concentration on the nerve is around 30 times lower than the administered stock for every compound , for which the efficacy has been individually validated . For retrograde transport experiments , 3 µ l of AlexaFluor - 488 - conjugated CtB ( Invitrogen ) was injected into the nerve prior to SNC . Drugs . H 2 O 2 , NAC , DPI , SF1670 , VAS2780 and MitoTEMPO were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich , LY294002 and CbD from Calbiochem . Stock solutions of H 2 O 2 ( 0 . 25 mg ml − 1 , 13 mM ) and NAC ( 5 mg ml − 1 , 30 mM ) were dissolved in saline . Stock solutions of DPI ( 100 µ M ) , SF1670 ( 20 mM ) , VAS2780 ( 3 mM ) , MitoTEMPO ( 3 mM ) , LY294002 ( 13 mM ) and CbD ( 100 µ M ) were dissolved in DMSO . Behavioral assessment of sensory functional improvement . Grid walk . Mice were allowed to run the grid walk ( 50 × 5 cm plastic grid ( 1 × 1 cm ) placed between two vertical 40 - cm - high wood blocks ) three times per session . The total number of steps and missteps per run for each hindpaw was analysed by a blinded investigator . Adhesive removal . Small adhesive stimuli ( 6 - mm round adhesive labels ) were placed on both hindpaws of the mouse , the time to make first contact with both forepaws , as well as the time to completely remove the adhesive were recorded for each paw . Each mouse received three trials . All testing was performed in the animal’s home cage by a blinded investigator . Quantitative superoxide measurement and NOX activity . Superoxide levels were measured using HPLC - based detection of 2 - hydroxyethidine ( EOH ) , the specific oxidation product of dihydroethidium ( DHE , Invitrogen ) , as previously described 42 . Tissue samples were incubated with DHE ( 100 µ M in PBS ) at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of PEG - superoxide dismutase ( PEG - SOD , 25 U ml − 1 ) . DHE oxidation products were extracted with acetonitrile . Supernatants were dried under vacuum and pellets were stored at – 20 °C in the dark until analysis . NADPH oxidase activity was measured in 20 µ g of protein from membrane or exosomal fractions , incubated with DHE ( 50 µ M ) at 37 °C in the dark and superoxide production stimulated by the addition of NADPH ( 300 µ M ) in PBS with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic ( PBS – DTPA ) . For HPLC , samples were dissolved in PBS – DTPA and injected . Quantification of EOH was performed by comparison of the peak signal of the samples and standard solutions under identical chromatographic conditions . Results are expressed as the ratio of EOH generated per DHE consumed ( initial DHE concentration minus remaining DHE ; EOH / DHE ) per mg tissue or protein . Western blot . Proteins from L4 – L6 DRGs , F11 cells ( Sigma - Aldrich , see Reporting Summary ) , exosomes or cultured BMDMs were extracted using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails ( Roche ) , lysed for 30 min on ice followed by 30 min centrifugation at 4 °C . Protein concentration was quantified using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit ( ThermoScientific ) . Subsequently , 10 – 50 μ g protein was loaded in SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes for 2 h . Membranes were blocked with 5 % BSA or milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with gp91phox ( 1 : 200 , BD biosciences ) , p47phox ( Santa Cruz ) , p - p47phox ( S345 ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , p67phox ( Abcam ) , p22phox ( Abcam ) , CD63 ( Biolegend ) , CD9 ( BD ) , TSG101 ( GeneTex ) , PDI ( StressGene ) , LAMP2 ( SantaCruz ) , CD71 ( BD ) , α - actinin 4 ( Abcam ) , H3 ( Abcam ) , SOD1 ( Abcam ) , RAB7 ( Abcam ) , GFP ( Abcam ) , IMPA1 ( CST ) , SSH3 ( CST ) , PPP1R12 ( Abcam ) , SRC ( CST ) , PP1c ( Abcam ) or PTEN ( CST ) antibodies at 4 °C overnight . Following HRP - linked secondary antibody ( GE Healthcare ) incubation for 1 h at room temperature , membranes were developed with ECL substrate ( ThermoScientific ) . Detailed antibody - related information is provided in Supplementary Table 6 . RAC1 – GTP levels . The Active RAC1 Pull - Down and Detection kit ( ThermoScientific ) was used for the detection of RAC1 – GTP level . The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . In brief , exosome pellets or BMDM cell lysates were resuspended in lysis buffer and 500 µ g of protein lysates were incubated with GST – PAK1 beads . Levels of bead - bound GTP – RAC1 and total RAC1 proteins were analysed by immunoblot using an anti - RAC1 antibody ( ThermoScientific ) . Immunoisolation of endosomal vesicles . Sciatic nerves from three mice were pooled and homogenized with micropestles . The post - nuclear supernatant was obtained using the NE - PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents ( ThermoScientific ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Subsequently 300 µ g of post - nuclear supernatant was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 10 µ g of RAB7 antibody ( Santa Cruz ) or rabbit IgG ( Jackson ) that had been preconjugated with M - 500 Tosylactivated Dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Immunoisolated proteins were washed five times with PBS , resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer , and analysed by western blotting according to standard procedures . Membranes were developed with Veriblot anti - IgG secondary antibody ( Abcam ) , to avoid the bands from IgG . Protein thiol oxidation labelling . Cells or L4 – L6 DRGs were collected by scraping or dissected ex vivo , respectively , before centrifugation , lysed using micropestles and proteins precipitated with trichloroacetic Acid ( TCA ) – acetone . Reduced protein thiols were blocked with lysis buffer ( 200 mM Tris , 6 M Urea , 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 05 % SDS ) containing 20 mM of methyl methanethiosulfonate ( MMTS , Sigma - Aldrich ) for 20 min at 50 °C . To remove excess MMTS , proteins were precipitated with TCA – acetone . Oxidized thiols were then reduced with lysis buffer with 20 mM of tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP , Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min at 30 °C . To remove the excess of TCEP , proteins were precipitated with TCA – acetone . Oxidized thiols were then labelled with 4 mM of N - [ 6 - ( Biotinamido ) hexyl ] - 3´ - ( 2´ - pyridyldithio ) propionamide ( HPDP – biotin , Sigma - Aldrich ) for 2 h at room temperature , negative controls were generated by not adding HPDP – biotin . Proteins were precipitated with TCA – acetone to remove excess HPDP – biotin , resuspended in lysis buffer and quantified . Subsequently , 1 mg protein per condition was incubated with neutravidin agarose resin ( ThermoScientific ) , and biotinylated proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer , and analysed using western blotting . DRG culture . Adult L4 – L6 DRGs were dissected and collected in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution ( HBSS ) on ice and digested according to standard procedures . Cultures were maintained in medium containing B27 and penicillin – streptomycin in DMEM : F12 . Preparation of conditioned medium from L929 cells . L929 - cell ( Sigma - Aldrich , see Reporting Summary ) conditioned medium ( LCCM ) was used as a source of macrophage colony stimulating factor ( M - CSF ) . A confluent monolayer of L929 cells was incubated with DMEM : F12 supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated FBS for seven days . The cell - free supernatant was then collected from the confluent monolayer , passed through a 0 . 22 - μ m membrane filter and kept at − 80 °C until use . BMDMs . BMDMs were obtained and cultured as described previously 43 . Differentiated BMDMs were activated by adding 100 ng ml − 1 LPS ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . At day 7 , cells were washed with PBS and collected by gently scraping . For transfection experiments , 2 × 10 7 cells per condition were electroporated with the Neon system ( Invitrogen ) at 1 , 300 V , 35 ms 1 pulse , with 1 µ g of GFP , p47phox wild - type or p47phox3 × expression plasmids . Exosome preparation . Medium from BMDMs was collected 24h after stimulation , centrifuged 5 min at 3 , 000 g to remove cells , and analysed by exosome precipitation from supernatants performed with Exoquick - TC Exosome precipitation solution ( System Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines . Exosomal protein extracts were resuspended in the appropriate buffer for each further analysis . BMDM - conditioned medium . Medium ( DMEM : F12 with penicillin – streptomycin ) was conditioned for 24 h in wild - type , Ncf1 − / − or Nox2 − / − LPS - activated BMDM standard cultures , as described when detailing the exosome © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Microfluidic chambers . 5 × 10 4 DRGs were plated onto the neuronal side of a Standard Neuron Device ( 150 - µ m microgroove barrier , Xona Microfluidics ) , through which a microfluidic current was forced towards the axonal side , according to the manufacturer’s guidelines . The axonal side was treated with vehicle , H 2 O 2 or BMDM - conditioned medium , or alternatively seeded with 5 × 10 5 BMDMs . When indicated , 100 µ M dynasore or DMSO was added . Neurons were then allowed to grow their axons across the grooves for 72 h , before cultures were fixed and stained . In vitro conditioned medium or / exosome administration on DRG cultures . The equivalent of 30 µ g of protein extracts of intact active exosomes from wild - type , Ncf1 − / − or Nox2 − / − LPS - activated BMDMs or PBS alone ( vehicle ) , were administered to DRGs , and DRGs were allowed to grow for 24 h . Alternatively , DRGs were seeded directly on BMDM - conditioned medium from GFP - or p47phox3 × – GFP - expressing BMDMs , and allowed to grow for 24 h , and when indicated 100 µ M dynasore or DMSO was added to the culture , transferrin - AlexaFluor - 594 ( 25 µ g ml − 1 , Invitrogen ) was added as endocytosis control . PKH67 staining . Membranes from BMDMs or exosomes were stained using the PKH67 kit ( Sigma - Aldrich ) according to the manufacturers’ guidelines . Electron microscopy . Exosome pellets were placed directly on the grids and allowed to settle for 5 min , fixed and washed before being loaded onto carbon - coated Formvar 200 mesh EM grids ( TAAB , UK ) . After incubation for 5 min ( without drying ) , samples were fixed for 5 min in 2 % glutaraldehyde and washed three in glass - distilled water . The grids were then stained for 20 min with 3 % aqueous uranyl acetate : 2 % methyl cellulose 1 : 9 ( for negative staining ) or with CD63 ( mouse , Biolegend ) and p22phox ( Rabbit , Abcam ) antibodies , and 6 or 12 - nm gold particle - conjugated secondary antibodies before analysis on a JEM 1400Plus electron microscope ( JEOL , Japan ) operated at 120 kV . Sciatic nerve regeneration . The sciatic nerve was exposed according to standard procedures and crush was performed as detailed above or a complete transection performed using iris microscissors ( FST ) , followed by stitching of the proximal and distal stump using polypropilene 9 - 0 sutures ( Ethicon ) . Three ( for the crush ) or seven days later ( for the complete transection ) , mice were transcardially perfused . Sciatic nerves were dissected and post - fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h and transferred into 30 % sucrose overnight . Subsequently , the samples were frozen in liquid N 2 , embedded in Tissue - Tek OCT compound , and cut in 10 - µ m sagittal sections . Tissue sections were immunostained for SCG10 ( rabbit , Novus ) , a marker for regenerating axons 44 . The number of regenerating axons caudal to the axotomy and their distance from the lesion epicentre were analysed in 4 – 6 sections per mouse using a fluorescence Axioplan 2 ( Zeiss ) microscope . Spinal cord injury . In brief , to perform the dorsal column crush , THY1 – YFP - H mice underwent a T10 laminectomy similar to what was performed before the dorsal column axotomy . Here , a dorsal column crush between bilateral dorsal root entry zones and deep until the central canal was performed with fine forceps ( FST ) . Additionally , the mice received a conditioning sciatic nerve lesion 12 h before spinal surgery . Fourteen days after spinal cord injury , mice were transcardially perfused . Spinal cords were dissected and post - fixed in 4 % PFA in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h and transferred to 30 % sucrose overnight , flash - frozen in liquid N 2 and embedded in Tissue - Tek OCT compound , and cut in 18 - µ m sagittal sections . Staining for GFAP ( rat , Invitrogen ) was performed following standard protocols 4 . Plasmids . pCDNA6 . 2emGFP ( Invitrogen ) , pEGFPc1 - human p47phox was a gift of N . Saito 45 .

In vivo redox state detection in tissue sections . In vivo oxidative levels were detected using DHE ( 5 mg kg − 1 ; Invitrogen ) . DHE was administered intraperitoneally 1 hour before euthanization . Alternatively , 3 µ l of 2 % oxyburst - BSA ( Invitrogen ) was injected in the nerve prior to SNC . For hydrocyanine – Cy3 ( ROSstar550 , LICOR ) , DRGs were freshly extracted and washed in ice - cold PBS – DTPA , and subsequently incubated with 100 µ M hydrocyanine – Cy3 in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C , washed once with PBS – DTPA , and fixed in 4 % PFA . Immunohistochemistry . Immunohistochemistry on tissue sections was performed according to standard procedures . For all antibodies used , antigen retrieval was performed with 0 . 1 M citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 2 ) at 98 °C , blocked for 1 h with 8 % BSA , 1 % PBS – Triton - X100 or 0 . 3 % PBS – Triton - X100 , and then incubated with NF200 ( mouse , Millipore ) , p47phox ( rabbit , SantaCruz ) , p - p47phox ( S345 , rabbit , Sigma - Aldrich ) , gp91phox ( 1 : 200 , mouse , BD Biosciences ) , ICAM1 ( mouse , Abcam ) , CD11b / c ( mouse , Novus ) , RAB7 ( rabbit , Abcam ) , GFAP ( rabbit , Millipore ) , SCG10 ( rabbit , Novus ) and / or p - Akt ( S473 ) ( rabbit , Cell Signaling ) antibodies at 4 °C overnight .

Photomicrographs were taken with an Axio Imager . Z1 / Apotome ( Zeiss ) microscope as 0 . 800 µ m z - stacks at 20 × or 40 × magnification and processed with the software AxioVision ( Zeiss ) . Alternatively , for confocal imaging , a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope was used and confocal images were taken at 60 × magnification and processed with the LAS - AM Leica software ( Leica ) . RNA - seq . RNA from L4 – L6 DRGs was immediately extracted using RNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) , according to the manufacturer’s guidelines . DNA contamination was removed by treating the spin column with 40 units of RNase - free DNase I ( Qiagen ) for 15 min at 23 °C prior to RNA elution . RNA concentrations and purity were verified following elution with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent ) . RNA with a RIN factor above 7 . 5 was used for library preparation . cDNA libraries were generated using the TruSeq stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit A ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) according to the recommended low - sample TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Guide protocol . cDNA was generated through reverse - transcriptase PCR using Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . cDNA was purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads ( Beckman - Coulter ) . Following ligation of unique adapter sequences , the DNA was enriched by 15 cycles of PCR amplification . Ligation and library integrity was verified using a DNA chip on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent ) with clean elution profiles at the correct size peak of about 260 bp . The Illumina TruSeq kit A adapter sequences were ligated to each sample in each group to allow for sequencing multiplexing . Sample libraries ligated with unique adapter sequences were multiplexed six per lane and were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 100 - cycle , single - end sequencing . Sequence alignment and differential expression analysis . Sequence reads were aligned to the mm10 mouse reference genome sequence using TopHat v . 2 . 0 . 12 ( http : / / genomebiology . com / 2013 / 14 / 4 / R36 ) running Bowtie2 v . 2 . 2 . 3 ( http : / / bowtie - bio . sourceforge . net / bowtie2 / index . shtml ) . Gene structure annotations corresponding to the Ensembl ( https : / / www . ensembl . org / index . html ) annotation of the mm10 genome sequence were used to build a transcriptome index and provided to TopHat during the alignment step . The aligned reads were sorted using samtools v . 0 . 1 . 19 ( https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pubmed / 19505943 ) , and read counts per gene were obtained from mapped reads using HTSeq v . 0 . 6 . 1 ( https : / / pypi . python . org / pypi / HTSeq / 0 . 6 . 1 ) . EdgeR v . 3 . 8 . 6 ( http : / / bioinformatics . oxfordjournals . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1093 / bioinformatics / btp616 ) ( using limma v . 3 . 22 . 7 ; https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pubmed / 25605792 ) in R v . 3 . 1 . 1 was used to identify differentially expressed genes . Differential expression testing was performed on the normalized output from EDASeq using edgeR . Read - level quality checking was performed using fastqc v . 0 . 10 . 1 and the fastqc - aggregator ( https : / / github . com / staciaw / fastqc _ aggregator ) and gene - level quality checking was performed using RSeQC - 2 . 6 . 1 ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pubmed / 22743226 ) . Further data filtering and processing was performed in MATLAB R2014b and R v . 3 . 1 . 1 , including creating visualizations with cummerbund v . 2 . 8 . 2 ( Goff , L . , Trapnell , C . and Kelley , D . , unpublished software package ) . The cut - off criteria for the differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) were set at P < 0 . 05 and log 2 ( fold change ) > 0 . 58 . Gene Ontology and pathway analysis of DEGs . DEG lists were separated into upregulated and downregulated genes for each comparison . SNA , NAC and H 2 O 2 DEG lists were uploaded to Venny ( http : / / bioinfogp . cnb . csic . es / tools / venny / ) to create Venn diagrams with the common DEGs between lists . DEGs present in SNA and H 2 O 2 , but not in NAC groups , were selected as ROS - dependent DEGs . Gene ontology ( GO ) , KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) and Ingenuity pathway analysis were then performed on those lists of DEGs . The DEGs were submitted to DAVID ( Database for Annotation , Visualization , and Integrated Discovery ( http : / / david . abcc . ncifcrf . gov / ) ) to find significantly enriched biological process terms , molecular function terms , and cellular component terms based on the GO database , as well as pathways based on the KEGG database . The thresholds for the significant associated GO functional category and pathways were set at P < 0 . 05 . Immunocytochemistry . Glass coverslips were coated with 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 PDL , washed and coated with mouse laminin 2 μ g ml − 1 ( Millipore ) . For myelin experiments , they were additionally coated with 4 μ g cm − 2 rat myelin . Cells were plated on coated coverslips for 36 h , and fixed with 4 % PFA – 4 % sucrose . Immunocytochemistry was performed by incubating fixed cells with anti - β III tubulin ( TUJ1 , mouse , Promega ) , RAB7 ( rabbit , Abcam ) , pan - TRK ( rabbit , Abcam ) or GFP ( mouse , Abcam ) antibodies at 4 °C overnight . This was followed by incubation with AlexaFluor - conjugated goat secondary antibodies according to standard protocols ( Invitrogen ) . All cells were counterstained with Hoechst ( Molecular Probes ) . Detailed antibody - related information is provided in Supplementary Table 6 .

NATuRE CELL BIoLoGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CEll BIOlOgy a constant fluorescence intensity threshold was set across samples . On the basis of this threshold , for each picture the intensity density of pixels was calculated in each channel and then divided by the respective number of cells ( about 225 cells per picture ) . This was done in triplicate and the investigator was blinded to the experimental group . Neurite length analysis . Immunofluorescence was detected using an Axiovert 200 microscope ( Zeiss ) and pictures were taken at 10 × magnification using a CDD camera ( Axiocam MRm , Zeiss ) . Five fields per coverslip were included in the analysis . All analyses were performed blinded . Neurite analysis and measurements were performed using the Neurite J plugin for ImageJ . In total , 30 – 50 cells were analysed per replicate . Quantification of axonal regeneration . 4 – 6 sections per mouse were analysed with a fluorescence Axioplan 2 ( Zeiss ) microscope . The lesion epicentre ( GFAP ) was identified in each section at 40 × magnification . The total number of labelled axons rostral to the lesion site was normalized to the total number of labelled axons caudal to the lesion site counted in all analysed sections for each mouse , obtaining a ratio that was comparable between mice . Distance from the axonal tip to the caudal margin of the lesion was also measured and averaged per mouse . Sprouting and regrowing fibres were defined following established anatomical criteria 47 .
