McConnell , Stanford University , Stanford , CA , and approved January 18 , 2005 ( received for review November 4 , 2004 ) The existence of lipid rafts in biological membranes in vivo is still debated . In contrast , the formation of domains in model systems has been well documented . In giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) prepared from ternary mixtures of dioleoyl - phosphatidylcholine (cid:1) sphingomyelin (cid:1) cholesterol , a clear separation of liquid - disordered and sphingomyelin - enriched , liquid - ordered phases could be ob - served . This phase separation can lead to the ﬁssion of the liquid - ordered phase from the vesicle . Here we show that in cholesterol - containing GUVs , the phase separation can involve dynamic redistribution of lipids from one phase into another as a result of a cross - linking perturbation . We found that the molecular structure of a sterol used for the preparation of GUVs determines ( i ) its ability to induce phase separation and ( ii ) the curvature ( positive or negative ) of the formed liquid - ordered phase . As a consequence , the latter can pinch off to the outside or inside of the vesicle . Remarkably , some mixtures of sterols induce liquid - ordered domains exhibiting both positive and negative curvature , which can lead to a new type of budding behavior in GUVs . Our ﬁndings could have implications for the role of sterols in various cell - biological processes such as budding of secretory vesicles , endocytosis , or formation of multivesicular bodies . giant unilamellar vesicles (cid:2) lipid rafts (cid:2) ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy A ccording to the raft hypothesis , cellular membranes are not a homogenous mixture of lipids but contain dynamic entities enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol ( rafts ) floating in the sea of glycerophospholipids ( 1 , 2 ) . It is assumed that the presence of long and saturated acyl chains in sphingolipids should allow cholesterol to become tightly intercalated with such lipids , resulting in the organization of liquid - ordered ( l o ) phases ( 3 – 5 ) . In contrast , unsaturated phospholipids are loosely packed and form a disordered state [ usually indicated as liquid crystalline or liquid - disordered ( l d ) ] . The difference in packing ability leads to phase separation ( 6 ) . The hypothesis postulates that distinct proteins can selectively partition into lipid rafts , indicating that rafts could serve as specific sites for molecular sorting and polarized transport . A vast number of papers have been dedi - cated to the investigation of the involvement of rafts in different vital cellular processes . These processes include intracellular and intercellular signaling , protein sorting , formation of caveolae , and endocytic pathways . Detection and investigation of rafts in vivo appeared to be so complicated that some recent papers challenged their existence ( 7 , 8 ) . Rafts have been operationally defined as detergent - resistant membranes ( DRMs ) , obtained by the treatment of membranes with mild detergents ( 9 , 10 ) . The correlation be - tween DRMs and rafts in vivo requires further clarification . In contrast to in vivo studies , model membranes provide an excel - lent opportunity to investigate short - and long - range organiza - tion within the membrane plane . For instance , studies carried out on ternary mixtures of cholesterol with phospholipids and sphingolipids show that l o phase domains , enriched in sphingo - lipids , can separate from l d phase , enriched in unsaturated phospholipids in the presence of cholesterol ( 11 ) . Presently , model systems are considered reasonable approximations for raft - containing cell membranes , although they remain artificial and crude . More recently , along with a number of techniques used to address questions on rafts , important contributions have come from different microscopical approaches ( 12 , 13 ) . Direct visu - alization of domains in model membranes has provided a tangible proof for the coexistence of liquid - ordered and liquid - disordered phases ( 14 ) . However , rafts are by no means static structures . If it is true that their main function consists in forming platforms to concentrate certain proteins , then a detailed char - acterization of lipid and protein dynamics in the different phases is essential to understand mobility - dependent protein organiza - tion . Single - particle and single - dye tracking ( tracing ) have been applied to follow raft - associated protein and lipid mobility in vitro and in vivo ( 15 , 16 ) . Additional contributions have come from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( 17 ) and flu - orescence resonance energy transfer ( 18 ) . Application of confocal fluorescence microscopy and fluores - cence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) allowed investigating the lipid spatial and dynamic organization in giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) prepared from ternary mixtures of 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) (cid:1) sphingomyelin ( SM ) (cid:1) cholesterol ( 19 , 20 ) . For a certain range of cholesterol concen - tration , formation of domains was observed . Strikingly , the lipophilic probe 1 , 1 (cid:1) - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 (cid:1) , 3 (cid:1) - tetramethylindocar - bocyanine perchlorate ( DiI - C 18 ) was largely excluded from these sphingomyelin - rich regions , in which the raft marker ganglioside GM1 was localized when visualized with cholera toxin B subunit . Cholesterol was shown to promote lipid segregation into two phases : a liquid - disordered , dioleoyl - phosphatidylcholine - rich phase exhibiting high probe mobility and a dense , liquid - ordered , sphingomyelin - rich phase . The latter exhibited between 6 - and 50 - fold lower probe mobility , depending on cholesterol concen - tration . Recently , Baumgart et al . ( 21 ) have used similarly composed cholesterol - containing GUVs and found that they adopt shapes that are in a good agreement with a theory proposed by Ju¨licher and Lipowsky ( 22 , 23 ) . The basic concept of this theory is that the tendency of the borderline around a domain to become shorter ( line tension ) makes the domain bulge out and finally bud off . The process is postulated to be controlled by the line This paper was submitted directly ( Track II ) to the PNAS ofﬁce .

In this article , we further investigated the process of phase separation in GUVs and describe several observations that could have implications for cellular processes . Firstly , we found that the phase separation is a highly dynamic process . GM1 , an accepted raftmarker , appears to reside in the l d phase and only upon the addition of its natural ligand cholera toxin is relocated to the l o phase . Secondly , sterols different from cholesterol are able to induce liquid - liquid phase separation . Although other methods have been used to study the effects of different sterols on lipid chain packing and domain formation ( 24 – 27 ) , this phase sepa - ration has not previously been directly visualized in GUVs . Thirdly , we show that the structure of sterols used for the preparation of GUVs determines not only the phase separation per se but also the positive or negative curvature of the formed , sterol - dependent phase and , thus , causes pinching off to the outside or inside of the vesicle . Finally , some mixture of sterols in GUVs can lead to a new type of budding behavior . Although there are still many open questions concerning the organization of biological membranes , it appears that both proteins and lipids ( e . g . , lysobisphosphatidic acid ; ref . 28 ) are involved . We specu - late that changes in the contents of different sterols could also play a role in shaping biological membranes , for example in the budding of secretory vesicles , in endocytosis , and in organelle formation . Materials and Methods Chemicals . DOPC , N - stearoyl - D - erythrosphingosylphosphoryl - choline ( a form of SM ) , and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids . GM1 was from Calbiochem . DiI - C 18 , cho - lesteryl 4 , 4 - difluoro - 5 , 7 - dimethyl - 4 - bora - 3a , 4a - diaza - s - inda - cene - 3 - dodecanoate ( cholesteryl BODIPY FL C 12 , BODIPY - Chol ) , BODIPY FL C 5 GM1 , and the Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate of cholera toxin B subunit ( CtxB - 488 ) were from Molecular Probes . Perylene was purchased from Fluka ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . 3 - ketocholesterol , lanosterol , and cholesterol sulfate ( CS ) were from Sigma - Aldrich . Lophenol was purchased from Research Plus ( Manasquan , NJ ) . Cholesteryl sulfonate was a kind gift of Christoph Thiele ( Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biol - ogy and Genetics ) . Sterol purity was checked by TLC . All other chemicals were of reagent grade . Preparation of GUVs and Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy . Details of the preparation of GUVs from ternary mixtures of DOPC , SM , and cholesterol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) plus 0 . 1 % GM1 by electroformation and imaging by confocal microscopy were described in ref . 19 . Because the composition with 33 % cholesterol is close to the upper boundary of coexistence in the phase diagram , sterol concentration was lowered to 28 % ( at a constant SM : DOPC ratio of 1 : 1 ) , if no domains could be observed at 33 % sterol . For CS and ketocholesterol , a series of sterol concentrations ( 16 % , 20 % , 24 % , 28 % , and 33 % ) was tested for their ability to induce visible phase separation , where the SM : DOPC ratio was always 1 : 1 . Vesicles may vary slightly in composition . Compositions indicated throughout this study refer to lipids in organic solvent before GUV formation ( 29 ) . DiI - C 18 and perylene were added in the amount of 0 . 1 mol % where indicated . BODIPY - Chol concentrations were individually adjusted for FCS , but they always were (cid:2) 0 . 1 % . GUVs were produced in 12 mM sucrose . The addition of 1 mM DTT as a precaution against oxidation did not influence results . CtxB was added at 5 (cid:1) g (cid:1) ml in the same solution that the GUVs were produced . To increase the number of vesicles undergoing fission , hypertonic solution ( 26 mM sucrose ) was injected into the flow chamber . Confocal imaging and FCS measurements were performed on an LSM 510 and a ConfoCor 2 combination setup ( Zeiss ) with a 40 (cid:3) 1 . 2 N . A . water immersion objective at room temperature as described in ref . 30 . For FCS , the 488 - nm laser line was attenuated to 5 (cid:1) W , the pinhole set to 90 (cid:1) m , and only one channel was recorded ( autocorrelation ) . The 1 (cid:1) e 2 lateral radius of the detection volume was (cid:2) o (cid:4) 0 . 15 (cid:1) m . The diffusion time , (cid:3) diff , was obtained from fitting the correlation curve to G ( (cid:3) ) (cid:5) N (cid:6) 1 (cid:1) ( 1 (cid:7) F (cid:1) ( 1 (cid:6) F ) exp ( (cid:6) (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:3) trip ) ) ( 1 (cid:7) (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:3) diff ) (cid:6) 1 (cid:7) c , where N is the number of particles in the effective detection volume , (cid:3) trip is the relaxation time of a fast blinking process , F is the dark fraction due to blinking , and c is an offset to account for slow fluctuations . The diffusion time can also be read directly from the FCS curves as the half - value decay time indicated in the normalized graphs . It is related to the diffusion coefficient by D (cid:5) (cid:2) o 2 (cid:1) ( 4 (cid:1) (cid:3) diff ) . Results Redistribution of GM1 from Liquid - Disordered into Liquid - Ordered Phase upon Addition of Cholera Toxin . In our studies we used the visualization of the phase separation in GUVs prepared from SM (cid:1) DOPC (cid:1) sterol (cid:1) GM1 by using confocal fluorescence micros - copy ( 19 ) . As markers of l d and l o phases , we used DiI - C 18 and CtxB - 488 , respectively . Previously , it was shown that the fluo - rescent marker DiI - C 18 is excluded from the sphingolipid - rich phase and favors the DOPC - rich phase . Upon incubation of GUVs with CtxB - 488 , for which GM1 is the natural binding partner , the complex GM1 – CtxB was detected only in areas from which DiI - C 18 was strongly excluded ( SM - enriched ) . We first investigated the dynamics of the staining of GUVs with CtxB - 488 . Fig . 1 A shows an image of a GUV immediately after the addition of CtxB - 488 . Unexpectedly , the distribution of GM1 initially coincides with that of DiI - C 18 ( compare with Fig . 1 B ) . Thus , the former is preferentially localized to l d before the addition of cholera toxin . With increased time , the fluorescence becomes stronger ( Fig . 1 C and E ) . More remarkable , however , is that the distribution of GM1 between phases changes dramat - ically . At intermediate times , it is evenly distributed between l d Fig . 1 .

Note that at any time of observation , there are regions excluding DiI - C 18 . Thus , the previously observed distribution of GM1 between l d and l o phase ( 19 ) was induced by the ligand ( CtxB - 488 ) . Interestingly , this relocation only takes place if the lipid tails have the potential to be associated with the ordered domain : synthetic BODIPY FL C 5 GM1 , which contains a BODIPY - fluorophore in place of one of the saturated carbon chains , remains in the liquid - disordered domain upon cholera toxin B binding ( data not shown ) . Our results are in line with the data provided by Dietrich et al . ( 14 ) , showing that on supported lipid bilayers , cross - linking by an antibody can change the location of a lipid . Molecular Structure of a Sterol Determines the Phase Separation . It is widely accepted that in model systems cholesterol promotes the phase separation . We investigated the influence of other sterols on this process by preparing GUVs that contained the same amount of DOPC and sphingomyelin and a variety of sterols . Some sterols , for example 3 - ketocholesterol , could not induce the phase separation at any of the concentrations tested ( see e . g . , Fig . 2 B ) . Similar images were obtained with CS ( see below ) . In contrast , the methylated sterols lanosterol ( a multiple - methylated cholesterol precursor ) and lophenol were able to induce the domain formation ( Fig . 2 C and D ) . Interestingly , cholesteryl sulfonate , despite its charged headgroup and struc - tural similarity to CS , yielded an unambiguous phase separation ( Fig . 2 E ) . Our observation of lanosterol , but not CS promoting phase separation , is in qualitative agreement with fluorescence quenching data by Xu et al . ( 26 ) . However , by employing direct visualization in GUVs , we can deduce here that for the sterols that induce phase separation , both phases are actually in a fluid state because domain shapes are circular ( data not shown ; similar as seen in Fig . 4 A and B ) . To further compare the phases formed by the different sterols to the phase formed by cholesterol , we characterized them by using FCS . As evident from Fig . 3 , the marker mobilities for all of the sterols in the sterol - rich phase are at least one order of magnitude slower than in the DOPC - rich phase . We conclude that the domains induced by these phase - separating sterols are more densely packed and ordered , making them clearly distin - guishable from the surrounding disordered phase . Nevertheless , the FCS data confirms that both phases are fluid . Diffusion in a gel phase should be much slower ( D (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 11 to 10 (cid:6) 16 cm 2 (cid:1) s ; ref . 31 ) . The diffusion coefficients measured for the phase of higher probe enrichment and faster diffusion ( D (cid:5) 5 to 7 (cid:3) 10 (cid:6) 8 cm 2 (cid:1) s ) are always close to that in pure DOPC ( D (cid:5) 8 (cid:3) 10 (cid:6) 8 cm 2 (cid:1) s ) . In contrast , the slower diffusion measured in the other phase depends strongly on the type of sterol ( cholesterol , D (cid:5) 5 (cid:3) 10 (cid:6) 9 cm 2 (cid:1) s ; cholesteryl sulfonate , D (cid:5) 8 (cid:3) 10 (cid:6) 10 cm 2 (cid:1) s ; lophenol , D (cid:5) 2 (cid:3) 10 (cid:6) 9 cm 2 (cid:1) s ; lanosterol , D (cid:5) 4 (cid:3) 10 (cid:6) 9 cm 2 (cid:1) s ) . We call these phases l d and l o , respectively . However , molecular order parameters in the ‘‘l o ’’ phase remain to be investigated . Taken together , the sterol structure determines whether phases are separated and tunes diffusional mobility of a probe in the l o phase , which suggests differential lipid packing and ordering . Fission of Entire l o Domains from GUVs : Sterol Structure Determines Curvature and Direction of Budding . Remarkably , the type of sterol used to prepare GUVs determined not only the dynamic prop - erties but also the preferred curvature of the l o phase and , ultimately , the direction of budding . GUVs composed of DOPC , SM , and cholesterol have been previously observed to possess a change in curvature at the boundary between the l d and the l o phase ( 21 ) . The protruding domain can spontaneously undergo fission from the vesicle , resulting in a vesicle differing in lipid composition from the mother vesicle ( see Fig . 2 A Right ) . Under increased hypertonic conditions , the number of vesicles under - going fission is augmented and the process is accelerated . In the case of cholesterol , the CtxB - labeled l o phase ( green ) typically exhibits a higher positive curvature , leading to budding to the outside ( Fig . 2 A ) . Interestingly , lophenol was similar to cholesterol with respect to the positive curvature and outward budding of the l o phase ( Fig . 2 D ) . However , different effects were obtained with lanosterol and cholesteryl sulfonate ( Fig . 2 C and E ) . Lanosterol and cholesteryl sulfonate typically formed l o phases with negative curvature that budded to the inside of the mother vesicles . As a consequence , small green vesicles within red GUVs were detected ( Fig . 2 C and E ) . Fig . 2 . The molecular structure of a sterol determines separation of phases inGUVsandthecurvatureofthel o phase . ConfocalimagesofGUVsproduced from DOPC : SM : sterol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) in 12 mM sucrose . The sterols used were choles - terol , 3 - ketocholesterol , lanosterol , lophenol , or cholesteryl sulfonate . GUVs in Left images are labeled with DiI - C 18 ( red ) only . Center images were taken (cid:4) 30 minutes after cholera toxin ( green ) has been added . Right images were takendirectlyafterinjectionof26mMsucrosesolution . Sameasinthecaseof cholesterol , DiI - C 18 labeling marks the l d phase and cholera toxin labeling marks the l o phase for all sterols that induce phase separation ( see Figs . 3 and 6 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . ( Scale bar : 10 (cid:1) m . ) The ratio of vesicles showing outward bulging ( or budding ) behavior to vesicles showing an inward preference was at least 10 for choles - terol and lophenol , and (cid:2) 1 (cid:1) 10th for lanosterol and cholesteryl sulfonate , as judged from overview scans with many vesicles . 3274 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0408215102 Bacia et al . Fission of the l o Phase Is Not Induced by the Addition of Cholera Toxin . To exclude the possibility that the process of bulging and fission of the l o phase is induced by the addition of CtxB - 488 ( Fig . 1 ) , a fluorescent marker that could detect the l o phase autono - mously was used . For this purpose , we tested both perylene ( Fig . 5 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) and BODIPY - Chol . These dyes partitioned between l d and l o phases more evenly than DiI - C 18 . Hence , they could reveal both phases ( Fig . 5 ; perylene , blue channel ) . Combined labeling with DiI - C 18 ( red ) allowed the distinction of l o and l d phases ( overlays ) . Curvatures and directions of budding in GUVs labeled with perylene were found to be the same as in GUVs labeled with cholera toxin . Thus , the fission is an intrinsic property of the l o phase and does not depend on the redistri - bution of GM1 to this phase induced by the addition of CtxB . Small Amounts of CS Are Sufficient to Tune Curvature of Cholesterol Containing GUVs . Because a living cell contains many different types of sterols , we set out to investigate the behavior of GUVs containing a mixture of sterols . As an example , we have chosen a mixture of cholesterol and CS . In contrast to cholesterol , CS as the sole sterol did not induce phase separation at any of the concentrations tested . Moreover , CS is a naturally occurring sterol that is found in high amounts in many tissues ( 32 ) . The total sterol content in the mixture was kept constant at 16 % , whereas cholesterol was substituted by CS in steps of 2 % ( Fig . 4 , composition bars ) . As expected , at 0 % , CS phases were completely separated ( Fig . 4 A ) , whereas at 16 % CS , no phase separation was detected ( Fig . 4 C ) . The addition of CS to cholesterol containing GUVs had two effects . First , it influenced the size of the formed l o phase . In the range of 0 – 8 % CS , the average size of domains decreased . Fig . 4 B shows an example of a GUV with medium - and small - sized domains that did not fuse to produce a single large domain typical of the cholesterol samples ( timescale (cid:4) 1 h ) . At high concentrations of CS , GUVs showed no detectable phase sep - aration ( Fig . 4 C ) . However , an increase in green ( CtxB ) back - ground was observed . This background might arise from tiny , CtxB - stained l o domains , which may have budded off . The variations in domain sizes observed in the quaternary system DOPC (cid:1) SM (cid:1) CS (cid:1) cholesterol as a function of CS - to - cholesterol ratio are to some extent similar to observations in ternary lipid systems upon changes of temperature ( see ref . 29 ) . Another remarkable effect of the partial CS substitution was the dramatic change of the membrane curvature ( Fig . 4 D – G ) . With pure cholesterol , GUVs typically showed bulging l o do - mains of only positive curvature ( Fig . 4 D ) . With increasing CS , GUVs showed bell - shaped l o domains ( Fig . 4 E ) . These domains consist of a central area with positive curvature , surrounded by a ring with negative curvature . Interestingly , the negative cur - vature ring led to budding of small vesicles to the inside of the GUV ( Fig . 4 F ) . This behavior is in contrast to the budding - out of entire l o domains observed with cholesterol alone . Finally , at 16 % CS , no domains but many multivesicular , tubular , and reticular structures were observed ( for example , Fig . 4 G ) . Discussion Our data raise once again the issue of the sensitive character of the l o phase and the influence of experimental procedures on the observation of raft association . The correlation between the sphingomyelin - rich l o phase detected in model membranes and lipid rafts , as assessed by the detergent insolubility assay ( DRMs ) , remains puzzling . Because both of them show similar enrichment in sphingolipids and cholesterol , and because the liquid - ordered state conveys detergent resistance , l o phase and DRMs were thought to be identical . In this study we show that GM1 , an established marker for rafts , is localized in the liquid - disordered phase before the addition of cholera toxin . On the one hand , the detergent treatment might artificially relocate a membrane constituent to rafts . However , the relocation to this phase could also be a natural process . Using confocal imaging , we have directly observed how GM1 sorts from the l d to the l o phase upon binding of its pentavalent ligand . This finding strongly supports the opinion that cross - linking , a common mode of receptor activation in the cell , could induce an association with rafts . Early experiments already indicated that the extent of GM1 association with DRMs can shift with the addition of cholera toxin for detection ( ref . 33 ; compare also refs . 34 and 35 ) . Our observations stress this detail in the biochemical data and suggest that simple amplification of interactions by oligomeriza - tion is sufficient to shift localization in favor of the l o phase . In line with this result , the use of significantly higher concentrations of GM1 ( 1 % ) , which favors the formation of clusters even in the absence of cholera toxin , leads to GM1 cluster localization inside the l o domains ( 13 ) . It has been previously described that domains in GUVs can spontaneously undergo fission from the rest of the vesicle ( 21 ) . Our observation of sterol - rich domains budding from GUVs confirms this finding . It appears , however , that l o and l d domains are not interchangeable with respect to properties that are relevant for budding and that the process is not only controlled by the line tension at the phase boundary . Rather , the structure of the sterol ( s ) in the l o phase can play a decisive role . The mechanism of how sterol structure can control the direction of budding remains uncertain . A tentative explanation Fig . 3 . Sterol structure determines the dynamic properties of the l o phase . FCS measurements of BODIPY - Chol in the more strongly labeled phase ( black curves ) and in the phase of lower probe enrichment ( gray curves ) of GUVs composed of DOPC : SM : sterol ( 1 : 1 : 1 : ) , where the sterol is cholesterol , cho - lesteryl sulfonate , lophenol , or lanosterol . Diffusion times (cid:3) diff can be read fromtheintersectionsofthebrokenlineswiththeabscissaeanddemonstratethattheprobemobilitydependsbothonthetypeofphaseandontheparticularsterol . Diffusion is in all cases faster in the more strongly labeled phase ( l d ) and slower in the other phase ( l o ) . BODIPY - Chol and DiI - C 18 exhibit the same qualitative partitioning ( see Fig . 6 ) . Hence , the DiI - C 18 - enriched domains correspond in all cases to the l d phase . Despite the qualitative resemblance , BODIPY - Chol partitioning was less pronounced than DiI - C 18 partitioning . BODIPY - Chol was therefore preferred for FCS measurements because a dye with more extreme partitioning ( e . g . , DiI - C 18 ) is more likely to produce artifacts in the correlation curve , in the event of a tiny vesicle of the brighter phase diffusing through the focus . Bacia et al . PNAS (cid:2) March 1 , 2005 (cid:2) vol . 102 (cid:2) no . 9 (cid:2) 3275 B I O C H E M I S T R Y might be inferred based on existing models ( 22 , 23 , 36 ) by additionally assuming a differential ability of sterols to flip - flop between the membrane leaflets . Phospholipids with their very polar headgroups flip - flop extremely slowly across the mem - brane ( half - time of several hours ; ref . 37 ) , whereas cholesterol having as a polar group only a hydroxyl group , flip - flops moderately fast ( half - time (cid:4) 1 sec ; refs . 38 and 39 ) . Cholesteryl sulfonate , with its charged bulky sulfonate group , could be expected to flip - flop considerably more slowly than cholesterol . The Ju¨licher & Lipowsky model of budding under the control of boundary line tension in cholesterol - containing vesicles as - sumes that the molecular number differences between the inner and outer leaflet are immediately adjusted by fast sterol flip - flop ( 22 , 23 ) . Budding in this case would be expected to proceed preferably to the outside because only an increase in positive domain curvature is able to relieve line tension immediately . This model explains the outward budding seen for cholesterol and lophenol . If one assumes that the flip - flop rate of cholesteryl sulfonate and lanosterol is slow , the required relative increase in the area of the outer leaflet would be impeded , and protrusion to the outside would be prevented . In this case , when GUV shape transformations are driven by osmotic deflation , protrusion to the inside ( stomatocyte shape formation ) should be favored in the way that it has already been modeled for pure phospholipid vesicles , where flip - flop is negligible ( 36 ) . The mechanism proposed here is supported by the remarkable observation of ‘‘budding - in , bulging - out’’ sequences ( Fig . 5 ; lanosterol ) . Bud - ding - in ( arrow ) removes more area from the inner than from the outer leaflet of the mother vesicle . The mother vesicle then bulges out ( arrowhead ) to accommodate the excess area in the outer leaflet . To summarize , the proposed flip - flop mechanism may explain how sterol type determines the directions of budding observed in the GUVs . More generally , the ability of cholesterol to flip - flop might endow the l o phase with an intrinsic budding capability . The l o phase appears to have a higher bending rigidity than the l d phase ( 40 , 41 ) , a property that should per se give it a lower propensity to bud . Nevertheless , rafts are believed to be effective sites for budding ( 42 ) , e . g . , in endocytosis ( 43 ) . By alleviating leaflet area restrictions , cholesterol flip - flop could compensate for the higher bending rigidity and facilitate l o domain budding . Our finding that various sterols have different abilities to form ordered phases or to determine their curvature might have cell - biological implications . Many processes in the cell , e . g . , secretion and endocytosis , depend on membrane curvature , budding , or pinching of vesicles ( 42 ) . Moreover , during endo - cytosis , multivesicular bodies are formed with vesicles engulfed by a large membrane structure . Several mechanisms of the formation of these structures involving specific lipid and protein components have been suggested ( 28 ) . The concentration or Fig . 4 .

A transition from clear phase separation ( A ; 16 % cholesterol ) to no observable domains ( C ; 0 % cholesterol ) occurs . At 8 % cholesterol and 8 % CS , a majority of GUVs show small domains that do not fuse to yield larger ones ( B ) . At more CS , GUVs look mostly uniform ( C ) . Confocal sections in D – G represent curvatures of GUVs at the cholesterol and CS concentrations indicated . At 16 % cholesterol , curvature is predominantly positive . With an increasing fraction of CS , bell - shapedl o domainswithanegativecurvatureclosetotheborderswiththel d domainsareobserved ( E and F ) . Asseeninthetimeseries ( F ) , attheedges , small l o phase vesicles bud inward ( arrow ) . At higher CS concentrations ( G ) , no domains but many tubular and reticular structures , are observed .

The cell has a plethora of various sterols that are intermediates in cholesterol biosynthesis or its degradation . These sterols might have specific functions in budding processes that have not yet been revealed . Two findings described in this article suggest that this process could be regulated by the sterol composition of a vesicle . For instance , lanosterol , which is a major intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway , has an opposite effect on budding than cholesterol . Even more intriguing is a putative role of CS in the regulation of cellular processes of budding and fusion . CS is a natural sterol occurring in many tissues in high amounts ( 32 ) . In the stratum corneum of epidermis , the CS - to - cholesterol ratio is as high as 1 : 10 or 1 : 5 ( even 1 : 1 in patients with X - linked ichthyosis ; ref . 44 ) . Involvement of CS in the stabilization of membranes , e . g . , protecting erythrocytes from osmotic lysis and regulating sperm capacitation , is well documented ( 45 , 46 ) . We show that the addition of small amounts of CS to cholesterol - containing GUVs can modulate domain size and curvature . It is tempting to speculate that enzymes involved in the synthesis or degradation of CS could be regulating the process of budding . Interestingly , a deficiency in cholesteryl sulfatase is associated with X - linked ichthyosis ( 47 ) . The possibility of a connection between this degenerative disease and the cellular process of vesicular bud - ding needs further investigation .
