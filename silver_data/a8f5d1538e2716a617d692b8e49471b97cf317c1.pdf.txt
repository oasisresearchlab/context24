Free energy proﬁle and kinetics of the formation of membrane invaginations by membrane - bending peripheral proteins Mohsen Sadeghi 1 , ∗ 1 Department of Mathematics and Computer Science , Freie Universit¨at Berlin , Arnimallee 12 , 14195 Berlin , Germany Curvature - inducing peripheral proteins have been observed to spontaneously remodel bilayer mem - branes , resulting in membrane invaginations and formation of membrane tubules . In case of proteins such as cholera and Shiga toxin that bend the membrane with locally isotropic curvatures , the result - ing membrane - mediated interactions are rather small . Thus , the process in which these proteins form dense clusters on the membrane and collectively induce invaginations is extremely slow , progressing over several minutes . This makes it virtually impossible to directly simulate the pathway leading to membrane tubulation even with highly coarse - grained models . Here , we present a steered molecular dynamics protocol through which the peripheral proteins are forced to gather on a membrane patch and form a tubular invagination . Using thermodynamic integration , we obtain the free energy proﬁle of this process and discuss its different stages . We show how protein stiffness , which also determines local membrane curvature , affects the free energy landscape and the organization of proteins in the invaginated region . Furthermore , we estimate the kinetics of the described pathway modeled as a Markovian stochastic process , and compare the implied timescales with their experimental counter - parts . I . INTRODUCTION Transport of material between living cells and their environment involves their passage through the cell membrane . While small molecules and ions can ei - ther directly permeate the membrane or be trans - ported through designated channels , larger molecules , biomolecular assemblies , and particulate substances usually rely on endo / exocytosis , for which the mem - brane undergoes signiﬁcant remodeling [ 1 ] . This can be mediated by scaffolding proteins such as clathrin and caveolin [ 2 – 5 ] , or be accomplished by the active cellular machinery , such as actin and dynamin assem - blies , capable of directly exerting force on the membrane [ 6 ] . On the other hand , toxins such as Shiga , cholera and ricin can internalize in the absence of both mech - anisms [ 7 – 10 ] . These toxins usually comprise of dis - tinct pathogenic and membrane - bending subunits . The latter , through a collaborative effort by several protein copies gathered in a dense cluster , can bend the mem - brane into long tubules necessary for the internalization of the former ( the glycolipid - lectin ( GL - Lect ) hypothesis ) [ 11 , 12 ] . Apart from its toxicological importance , this pathway can potentially be manipulated to deliver drugs or antigens to the living cells [ 12 ] . Spontaneous formation of tubular membrane invagi - nations can in general occur due to different physical mechanisms . For example , adsorption of molecules that change the spontaneous curvature of the membrane due to asymmetric tension can result in spontaneous tubulation [ 13 ] . Protein - protein crowding is also a sig - niﬁcant driver of membrane tubulation [ 14 ] . Osmotic pressure resulting in volume reduction , or a growth in ∗ mohsen . sadeghi @ fu - berlin . de membrane area can also lead to the formation of sta - ble membrane tubules [ 15 ] . We direct the interested reader for more examples to see [ 16 ] and references within . To understand how membrane budding and tubu - lation can progress under the inﬂuence of membrane - bending peripheral proteins , the most reliable approach is to estimate the free energy landscape of this process . Several studies have previously addressed this problem . Ewers et al . offered a theoretical model that included the local curvature induced ( and preferred ) by each pro - tein and its corresponding energy in an interplay with the large energy barrier due to neck formation ; to in - vestigate the tubulation free energy proﬁle and the pos - sibility of spontaneous tubule nucleation [ 17 ] . Tourdot et al . used a continuum membrane model with curva - ture ﬁelds and monitored the change in excess chemi - cal potential of membrane - bending proteins to mark the tubulation threshold [ 18 ] . Mathijs et al . considered a Ginzburg - Landau - type free energy for the protein coat and discussed the stability of the cylindrical tubes cov - ered with proteins [ 19 ] . Mahapatra and Rangamani de - veloped a theoretical model to estimate the free energy of membrane tubulation due to bound BAR - domain pro - teins with anisotropic curvature , and showed the snap - through characteristics in the dome - to - cylinder transi - tions [ 20 ] . While these studies are quite illuminating , they usually ignore membrane - protein interplay in a dy - namical setup , and thus , provide limited information on the kinetics of the tubulation process . Here we offer a fresh take on this problem , using a mesoscopic dynamical membrane model [ 21 ] . We had previously shown this model to reproduce realistic ki - netics attributed to membrane ﬂuctuations [ 22 , 23 ] as well as lateral diffusion of membrane - bound peripheral proteins [ 24 ] . While the dynamical nature of this model allows for the kinetics of the proposed pathway to be studied , it also limits the timescales available to unbi - 2 ased simulations . To remedy the latter , while beneﬁt - ing from the former , we lay out a scheme for steered simulations , in which peripheral proteins are artiﬁcially directed along the tubulation pathway . We show how the free energy proﬁle of all stages of this process can be recovered , and kinetics of its different steps approx - imated . We discover that the difference in protein stiff - ness ( which affects how it imprints its curvature on the membrane ) plays a deciding role in the spontaneous for - mation of membrane invaginations . II . THEORY Free energy estimation from steered simulations : Considering the deﬁnition of the Gibbs free energy as G = U + pV − TS , where U , p and V are the internal energy , pressure and the volume of the system , and T and S are the temperature and entropy , the free energy change in an isothermal reversible process is given as , dG = dU + d ( pV ) − TdS = δW rev + d ( pV ) ( 1 ) where δW rev is the reversible work done on the system during the process , excluding the work exchanged in vol - ume change . The right hand side follows the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics plus the fact that TdS is the heat re - versibly transferred to the system . Thus , the free energy difference between two thermodynamic states A and B depends on the external work done on the system to evolve it between the two states in a slow transition . The transition should be slow enough that thermodynamic equilibrium can be reasonably assumed for the interme - diate states . The free energy difference between the two states can be written as G B − G A = λ B (cid:90) λ A f ext ( λ ) dλ + B (cid:90) A d ( pV ) ( 2 ) where λ denotes a speciﬁc ( macroscopic ) parametriza - tion of the path taken from A to B , and f ext ( λ ) repre - sents the external force exerted on the system at each step along the transition path . We consider the microscopic state of the system to be fully described by the phase vector z = ( q , p ) , where components of q are positions of particles , plus any other degrees of freedom necessary to the sys - tem’s conﬁguration , and components of p are the con - jugate momenta . We aim to connect the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of the transition by relat - ing f ext ( λ ) , to an ensemble average over the gener - ally time - dependent distribution of microscopic forces corresponding to an instantaneous value of λ . With the assumption of slow transition , we may describe any macrostate tagged by a value of λ with the ( equilibrium ) Boltzmann distribution of microstates with the partition function Q ∝ (cid:82) exp ( − βu λ ( z ) ) d z and β = 1 / kT , where k is the Boltzmann constant . To simplify the formula - tion , we have used the notion of generalized potential u λ , which , for example , in the isothermal - isobaric en - semble would be u λ ( z ) = H ( s ; L ) + pV , where p is the surrounding pressure , V the system volume , and H ( s ; L ) is the system’s Hamiltonian , with s = z / L be - ing the phase vector scaled down by the system size , L [ 25 , 26 ] . Equilibrium free energy of a thermodynamic state is simply G = − kT ln Q , resulting in , G B − G A = λ B (cid:90) λ A ∂G ∂λ dλ = − 1 β λ B (cid:90) λ A 1 Q ∂Q ∂λ dλ = λ B (cid:90) λ A (cid:68) ∂u λ ∂λ (cid:69) λ dλ = λ B (cid:90) λ A (cid:20)(cid:68) ∂ H ( s ; L ) ∂λ (cid:69) λ + (cid:68) ∂ ( pV ) ∂λ (cid:69) λ (cid:21) dλ ( 3 ) which should be familiar as the thermodynamic integra - tion scheme . Comparing eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 2 ) , suggests the relationship f ext ( λ ) = (cid:104) ∂ H ( s ) / ∂λ (cid:105) λ = −(cid:104) f int ( s ) (cid:105) λ . This relation can be understood as the balance between the ( macroscopic ) external force f ext , and the ensemble average of microscopic internal forces , f int . Reaction coordinate and the external force : In this study , we have performed steered simulations in which peripheral proteins on the surface of the membrane are drawn toward the center of the membrane patch ( ﬁgure 1A ) . This happens under the inﬂuence of two - dimensional centripetal forces that have constant mag - nitude ˜ f , but change directions to always point to the central axis ( ﬁgure 1A ) . For the macroscopic parameter λ that describes the transition of the system ( i . e . the re - action coordinate ) , we have chosen the mean in - plane radial distance of protein particles from the center of the simulation box , λ = r c = 1 N p N p (cid:88) i = 1 r c , i ( 4 ) where r c , i is the two - dimensional radial distance of parti - cle i ( which represents one protein ) from the center and N p is the total number of proteins on the membrane sur - face . Simulations are done in an orthogonal box with its extents along the X , Y , and Z directions arranged in the vector L = ( L X , L Y , L Z ) . The membrane lies initially ﬂat in the XY plane , and is laterally coupled to a baro - stat controlling the XY in - plane pressure components . Thus , we write the generalized potential in this speciﬁc ensemble as u ( z ) = H ( s ; L ) + 1 2 ( p X + p Y ) A L Z ( 5 ) where A = L X × L Y is the projected area of the mem - brane patch ( that may ﬂuctuate due to the action of the barostat ) , and p X and p Y are the in - plane components of the pressure tensor by isotropically scaling both L X 3 and L Y ( the ratio L X / L Y is preserved ) . Using the chain - rule of differentiation , we have , ∂u λ ∂λ = (cid:20) ∂ ∂λ H ( s ; L ) (cid:21) A + ∂u λ ∂A ∂A ∂λ = (cid:104) N p ˜ f (cid:105) ∗ A + 1 λ ( p X + p Y ) A L Z ( 6 ) Care is to be taken in evaluating the ﬁrst term on the right hand side marked by an asterisk such that the con - tributions to the external work are only included due to changes in λ occurring under the inﬂuence of the force , and not scaling by the barostat . For the second term , and in order to obtain ∂A / ∂λ , we model the si - multaneous scaling of the simulation box in the X and Y direction with an instantaneous “strain” (cid:15) , such that L X = ( 1 + (cid:15) ) L X , 0 and L Y = ( 1 + (cid:15) ) L Y , 0 , in which L X , 0 and L Y , 0 are the box dimensions before the scaling . We would thus have , ∂λ / ∂(cid:15) = λ 0 and ∂A / ∂(cid:15) = 2 ( 1 + (cid:15) ) A 0 , where similarly , λ 0 and A 0 correspond to the state be - fore the scaling . This results in lim (cid:15) → 0 ∂A / ∂λ = 2 A 0 / λ 0 . Using eq . ( 6 ) , and by keeping the magnitude of the ra - dial external forces constant , while monitoring the pres - sure tensor during the simulation , we can use eq . ( 3 ) to obtain free energies . Kinetics : Given that the free energy proﬁle as a func - tion of the reaction coordinate λ is available , one simple approach to estimating the kinetics of spontaneous pro - cesses is to consider a diffusion process on this one - dimensional energy landscape [ 27 ] . To estimate the timescales of slow processes in such a description , we take two different approaches . The ﬁrst approach , which is less accurate but more intuitive , is based on the ap - proximate model of diffusion over a double - well poten - tial . Transition time from a harmonic potential basin , with the minimum energy of E A = E ( λ A ) , to another basin with E C = E ( λ C ) , when the two basins are separated by a barrier of maximum energy E B = E ( λ B ) , can be estimated by the Kramers equation [ 28 – 31 ] , (cid:104) τ A → C (cid:105) = 2 πkT D (cid:112) | E (cid:48)(cid:48) ( λ A ) E (cid:48)(cid:48) ( λ B ) | exp (cid:18) E B − E A kT (cid:19) ( 7 ) where E (cid:48)(cid:48) ( λ ) is the second derivatives of the energy function with respect to the one - dimensional reaction co - ordinate , and D is the appropriate diffusion coefﬁcient for the random walk on the energy landscape . The as - sumption in Kramers model is that there exists a sepa - ration of timescales between the fast local dynamics in each potential basin , and the slow dynamics of barrier - crossing . In our case , we can identify several double - well - like regions in the free energy landscape and ap - ply eq . ( 7 ) sequentially between them . This would be an approximation , as for each double - well , we would ig - nore all transitions other than the intermediate barrier crossing . While there exist models in which transitions between multiple energy basins have been considered [ 32 ] , they also come with other sets of simplifying as - sumptions that do not hold in our case . The second , and more reliable approach is to use the transfer operator that describes the evolution of prob - ability densities through diffusion on the whole energy landscape . Considering the time - dependent probabil - ity density P t ( x ) , and its weighted counterpart ˜ P t ( x ) = P t ( x ) / µ ( x ) with µ ( x ) being the equilibrium ( stationary ) probability density , the transfer operator T τ with the lag - time τ is deﬁned as [ 33 , 34 ] , ˜ P t + τ ( y ) = T τ ◦ ˜ P t ( y ) = 1 µ ( y ) (cid:90) P ( x , y ; τ ) µ ( x ) ˜ P t ( x ) dx ( 8 ) where P ( x , y ; τ ) is the transition probability density be - tween states x and y ( i . e . P ( x , y ; τ ) dxdy is the prob - ability of transitioning between states in [ x , x + dx ] to states in [ y , y + dy ] ) . Eigenvalues of the transfer oper - ator ( ω i ’s ) are related to the timescales of transitions as t i = − τ / ln ω i [ 34 , 35 ] . Making the assumption of over - damped diffusion in the reaction - coordinate space , we can estimate the transition probabilities from Brownian dynamics , P ( x , y ; τ ) ∝ exp (cid:34)(cid:0) ( y − x ) + D τ kT E (cid:48) ( x ) (cid:1) 2 4 Dτ (cid:35) ( 9 ) where − E (cid:48) ( x ) is the effective force at position x . III . MODELING AND SIMULATION All simulations have been performed using the mem - brane model developed by the author [ 21 – 24 , 36 ] . In this model , the membrane comprises of a series of particle dimers , with each particle representing a patch of lipids on one leaﬂet . Particle dimers interact with their near - est neighbors via Morse - type bond - stretching and har - monic angle - bending potentials . In - plane bond - ﬂipping moves are implemented to mimic the ﬂuidity of the bi - layer [ 21 ] . More recently , we showed how peripheral proteins can be incorporated in the model via force ﬁeld masking [ 24 , 36 ] . Here we have used the same set of parameters as presented in [ 24 , 36 ] . We have modeled two types of proteins with the stiffness values of Y p = 100 MPa and Y p = 200 MPa . Both proteins are considered to have a geometry of the membrane - binding subunit similar to Shiga toxin sub - unit B ( STxB ) . We have used this geometric represen - tation to connect the stiffness values of a solid model of the protein to their elastic contribution to the membrane - protein energy landscape ( see [ 24 ] and its supplemen - tary information ) . Protein stiffness has a distinct ef - fect on the distributions of local membrane curvature . This is reﬂected in the data we obtained from unbiased simulations with the two protein types ( ﬁgure 1A ) . The range of curvatures obtained here can be compared with previously reported values , ( i ) membrane curva - ture of 0 . 055 ± 0 . 012 nm − 1 measured in curvature sort - ing study of Cholera toxin subunit B ( CTxB ) [ 37 ] , ( ii ) 4 curvature of 0 . 02 nm − 1 extrapolated from the change in area per molecule when STxB binds to gel - phase monolayers [ 38 ] , and ( iii ) molecular dynamics simulation of STxB binding to membranes containing the receptor Gb3 , which predicts curvatures of 0 . 034 ± 0 . 004 nm − 1 or 0 . 035 ± 0 . 003 nm − 1 , depending on acyl chain saturation [ 39 ] . Flat membrane patches of 300 nm lateral size with a number of bound peripheral proteins randomly scattered on the surface are used as initial conﬁguration of each simulation . For each of the two protein types , 10 dif - ferent realizations of the steered simulations that start from different initial conﬁguration are performed ( ﬁgure 1B ) . External forces with the magnitude of 0 . 5 pN , and the direction continually passing through the central axis of the simulation box , are applied to each protein ( ﬁgure 1A ) . The centripetal forces cause a drift in the stochastic motion of the proteins , guiding them toward clustering in the center of the box within the time limit of each real - ization . Simulations are allowed to run until no further development in the membrane remodeling is observed . In some cases , the simulations were terminated prema - turely due to instabilities caused in the coarse - grained model under the inﬂuence of the external force . In the end , all the stable parts of trajectories were cropped and used together . During each simulation , particle positions have been propagated using anisotropic over - damped Langevin dynamics that includes hydrodynamic interactions be - tween nearest neighbors [ 22 , 23 ] . Water , with the dy - namic viscosity of 0 . 7 mPa s , has been used as the sur - rounding ﬂuid environment . Simulation box is later - ally coupled to a zero - pressure bath via a stochastic Langevin - piston barostat [ 40 , 41 ] . All simulations have been performed at constant 310 K temperature . IV . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Under the inﬂuence of the centripetal external forces , proteins cluster in the center of the membrane patch and eventually induce a pit that may further develop into an invagination ( ﬁgures 1B and 1C and supplementary movies ) . Before moving forward with the free energy es - timation procedure , we need to verify that the steered simulations are indeed performed slow enough for the membrane system to be considered at quasi - equilibrium throughout . As a ﬁrst step , we can check simulation times against the physical timescales of the system . Fluctuations of the membrane , with the wave vector q , have a hydrodynamic dissipation timescale of 4 η / κq 3 , where η is the viscosity of the solvent and κ ≈ 20 kT is the bending rigidity of the membrane . This gives the hydrodynamic dissipation timescale to be in the 0 . 01 ms range . One consideration in this derivation is the fact that the organization of membrane - bending proteins can decrease the effective bending rigidity of the membrane [ 42 ] , in effect increasing the hydrodynamic relaxation timescale . However , in our case , it still leaves it far smaller than other timescales in the system estimated next . The proteins in the present model have a lateral dif - fusion constant of D p ≈ 0 . 3 µ m 2 s − 1 [ 24 ] . The average time for proteins to diffuse the mean distance ∆ r be - tween nearest neighbors can be estimated as ∆ r 2 / 4 D p . With the surface density of proteins used in these sim - ulations , we arrive at an upper limit of 0 . 1 ms for the timescale of protein diffusion . As the next step , and to get a more reliable estimate of the timescale of slow dif - fusive processes , we consider unbiased simulations of proteins diffusing on the membrane in the absence of external forces . We used a similar collective variable r c , measured with respect to the center of mass of pro - teins scattered on the membrane patch . By looking at the initial decay in the time - correlation function of r c , we estimated timescales between 0 . 05 ms and 0 . 11 ms , de - pending on the protein stiffness and their surface con - centration ( ﬁgure 1B ) . Thus , in comparison , our steered simulations that progress for several milliseconds ( ﬁgure 1 ) , are at least one order of magnitude slower than the slowest process involved in our system . This justiﬁes the quasi - equilibrium picture used in the thermodynamic in - tegration scheme . Finally , from a different perspective , we can compare the magnitude of the external forces on the proteins in our simulations with more relatable bi - ological examples . Using optical traps , the unidirectional force that the molecular motor kinesin produces to move cargo along microtubules has been measured to be as large as 6 . 5 pN [ 43 ] . Another example is the forces gen - erated by the growth of a single actin ﬁlament , which has been estimated to be 0 . 8 pN [ 44 ] . Thus , the forces used in our steered simulation are one order of magni - tude smaller than the force exerted by the motor protein , and comparable with the action of the cytoskeleton ( ﬁg - ure 1B ) . We have used eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) to estimate the free energy proﬁle of the formation of membrane invagina - tions . Figure 2A shows the estimated ensemble aver - ages (cid:104) ∂u λ / ∂λ (cid:105) λ for the two proteins , obtained by bin - ning trajectories from all realizations along r c and apply - ing eq . ( 6 ) . The free energy values are obtained form eq . ( 3 ) via numerical integration of (cid:104) ∂u λ / ∂λ (cid:105) λ using the trapezoid rule . The uncertainty in (cid:104) ∂u λ / ∂λ (cid:105) λ ensem - ble averages has been estimated via bootstrapping , with the resampling repeated 2000 times for each bin . The estimated errors in (cid:104) ∂u λ / ∂λ (cid:105) λ have been propagated through the thermodynamic integration . For that , we have recorded the distribution of (cid:104) ∂u λ / ∂λ (cid:105) λ values for each bin , and resampled each discrete value along the integration path . Numerical integration of thus produced stochastic trajectories are repeated until the mean val - ues converge . Integration and error estimation is also done for both directions ( λ A to λ B and vice versa ) ( ﬁg - ure 2B ) . Overall , the free energy proﬁles reveal that the forma - tion of a membrane pit or invagination is energetically fa - 5 vorable for both proteins ( ﬁgure 2B ) . To put the range of free energies into perspective , we may refer to estimates of free energy of membrane conformations relevant to the invagination process . For that , we can use the Hel - frich Hamiltonian H = (cid:82) [ 2 κ ( H − H 0 ) 2 + ¯ κK ] dA , where H , H 0 and K are the mean , spontaneous and Gaussian curvatures and κ and ¯ κ are the corresponding elastic constants [ 45 , 46 ] . Using the differential geometry of surfaces of revolution [ 47 ] , we have estimated the mean membrane curvature along the wall of the invagination formed by the 200 MPa proteins in the ﬁnal stages of the longest simulation ( ﬁgure 2C ) . Our results points to the fact that the neck region is a minimal surface ( in this case a catenoid ) with zero mean curvature ( ﬁgure 2C ) . But the region covered by proteins has in general non - zero mean curvature . Using the Helfrich functional , we found the total bending energy of the membrane in the invaginated region to be 475 kT . For comparison , for - mation of a hemispherical cap from a ﬂat membrane re - quires an energy of 4 πκ , which for κ = 20 kT [ 48 ] , gives a value of 251 kT . Or a cylindrical membrane tubule of length L and radius R would have an energy of 4 πκL / R , which for the approximate maximum length of 150 nm and mean tube radius of 50 nm observed in our simula - tions , would result in a value as high as 750 kT . The high energy cost of bending the membrane should be com - pensated through the interplay with the ﬂexible proteins . The dip in free energy occurs when the proteins suc - cessfully coat the pits , and thus compensate the rather large energies needed to deform the membrane . We observe signiﬁcant free energy barriers at the on - set of pit formation ( 3 → 4 → 5 transitions for the 100 MPa and 4 → 5 → 6 transitions for the 200 MPa pro - teins in ﬁgure 2B ) . Heights of these barriers are compa - rable to the 30 − 90 kT range of excess chemical poten - tials estimated by Tourdot et al . for the onset of mem - brane tubulation ( ﬁgure 3B ) [ 18 ] . While the curved re - gion of the pit complies with the preferred curvature of peripheral proteins , and reduces the overall elastic en - ergy , presence of the proteins in the connecting neck region is unfavorable with respect to their elastic energy , and contributes to the barrier [ 9 ] . It is reasonable to ex - pect the organization of proteins in dense clusters on the membrane to also have an effect . We observe the 200 MPa proteins to experience a signiﬁcantly smaller barrier at the onset of pit formation compared to their less stiff counterpart ( ﬁgure 2B ) . Comparing snapshots along the reaction coordinate ( ﬁgure 2B ) , as well as ob - serving the trajectories of steered simulations ( supple - mentary movies ) reveals that stiffer 200 MPa proteins have a higher tendency for forming clusters as they drift closer together . We had previously observed the same trend in unbiased simulations [ 24 ] . We also measured larger pairwise attractions between these proteins [ 36 ] . We can therefore argue that the stiffer proteins can be organized in a pit with less energy expenditure , and ex - perience an overall smaller barrier at the onset of pit for - mation . While simulations with 100 MPa proteins progress to smaller r c values , this progression mostly corresponds to the formation of a shallow pit densely covered by pro - teins ( ﬁgure 2B and supplementary movie 1 ) . Thus , the seemingly lower free energy values are the result of having less deformation in the membrane ( consider the large difference in the calculated membrane ener - gies between a hemispherical cap and the membrane in - vagination with 200 MPa proteins or a cylindrical tubule ) . With the 200 MPa proteins , on the other hand , a deep invagination at larger r c values is fully formed ( ﬁgure 2B and supplementary movie 2 . Notice the 1 / r c scaling on the x - axis of ﬁgure 2B ) . The 200 MPa proteins also dis - perse over the invaginated area less densely . This may be attributed to the fact that these proteins have to navi - gate the curvature landscape of the membrane invagina - tion toward regions best matching their preferred mean curvature ( compare curvature distributions in ﬁgure 1A with 2C ) . Considering the free energy differences be - tween the invaginated and ﬂat states , it can be stated that while formation of tubular invaginations is a slow process governed by large energy barriers , it is essen - tially irreversible in the current setup , unless other pa - rameters such as the membrane tension are changed . To estimate the kinetics of the stages of the invagina - tion process , as highlighted with the free energy land - scape , we used the two approaches described in sec - tion II . For both approaches , we needed an estimate of D r c . This value is generally not constant and depends on r c . Also , as was shown in ﬁgure 1B , the assump - tion of Markovian dynamics in r c space ( equivalent to the over - damped dynamics described in eq . ( 9 ) ) only holds over a large lag - time of ≈ 0 . 1 ms . Thus , we ap - proached this by binning the trajectories along r c and us - ing asymptotic ﬁts to the mean squared displacements in each bin to obtain long - time estimates to the diffusion coefﬁcient . The result is an estimate of D r c accompa - nied by the uncertainties resulting from limited sample sizes in each bin ( ﬁgure 3A ) . The local double - well approximation of the free en - ergy proﬁle yields transition times that depict a path severely hindered by the intermediate high barriers ( ﬁg - ure 3B ) . While the maximum estimated barrier height for the 200 MPa proteins in transition from ﬂat membrane and dispersed protein to the pit formation is 25 kT , for 100 MPa proteins , this value can reach 43 kT . Such a high energy barrier in effect renders it impossible for these proteins to spontaneously form an invagination ( ﬁgure 3B ) . The more accurate analysis is possible using the transfer operator approach ( eq . ( 8 ) ) . We have used the same lag - time of 0 . 1 ms to build discretized transi - tion matrices ( ﬁgure 3C ) . A spatial grid of 500 bins is built over the range of r c . The lag - time is divided into 1400 sub - steps , and the transition matrix for the whole lag - time is simply obtained as the product of transition matrices of the sub - steps . In each sub - step , we esti - mate the transition probabilities as one step Brownian 6 motion ( eq . ( 9 ) used with the timestep τ / N s where N s is the number of sub - steps ) . Number of sub - steps are cho - sen large enough to ensure the convergence of eigen - values of the transfer operator , while preventing under - ﬂow in numerical implementation of eq . ( 9 ) . In order to preserve the probability within the solution domain , we have introduced harmonic walls as extensions of the free energy landscape on the both boundaries . Additionally , the transition probability is also normalized in each sub - step . Comparing the spectrum of eigenvalues of the trans - fer operator for the two cases reveals the presence of several slow processes ( ﬁgure 3C ) . Noteworthy is that the timescales implied by these transition modes also include the reverse process of going from invaginated states to the ﬂat conﬁguration , and hence the num - ber of eigenvalues close to one . We can distinguish which transition is represented by a speciﬁc eigenvalue by looking at the corresponding eigenfunction [ 34 ] . The eigenfunctions of the transfer operator highlight the ﬂow of probability along the reaction coordinate . This pro - cedure has the added beneﬁt of being independent of the admittedly arbitrary choice of intermediate states in the previous approach . For the two protein types stud - ied here , we have selected the three eigenfunctions that best match the dynamics of ﬁnal barrier crossing be - fore a pit is successfully formed ( ﬁgure 3C ) . The implied timescale for the slowest transition for the 100 MPa pro - teins is prohibitively large , while for 200 MPa proteins we arrive at an estimate of about 6 min ( ﬁgure 3C ) . We may compare this timescale with the time it takes STxB pro - teins to induce tubules when incubated with giant unil - amellar vesicles ( GUV’s ) . In these experiments , tubu - lation had been observed after 5 min [ 8 ] . Uncertainties in the estimated free energies and diffusion coefﬁcients render it difﬁcult to make a strong statement about this result . Although , considering the fact that the exponen - tial dependence causes each kT of barrier energy to al - most triple the timescale , we have achieved remarkably comparable estimates . V . CONCLUSION We have used a particle - based membrane model in - cluding particles representing curvature - inducing pro - teins to study the formation of membrane tubular invagi - nations using steered simulations . We obtained the free energy proﬁle of this process from thermodynamic in - tegration ( ﬁgure 2 ) . Formation of similar invaginations have been observed with dynamically triangulated mem - brane models in Monte Carlo simulations [ 18 , 39 ] . Com - pared to that , our work has two distinctive features : ( i ) our model reproduces the long - range effects of the cur - vatures induced by peripheral proteins and the resulting static and dynamic membrane - mediated interactions in - trinsically and without the need for explicit enforcement [ 24 , 36 ] , and ( ii ) using steered molecular dynamics , we get a glimpse of a candidate process of proteins cluster - ing on the membrane , followed by a pit being formed and developed into a membrane invagination . Our steered simulations not only highlighted the rather rough free en - ergy landscape stretching between the ﬂat to the invagi - nated conﬁgurations , but also made it possible to con - sider the kinetics of this process in details . Previously , we exhaustively validated the kinetics of this model [ 22 – 24 ] . We also took great care in establishing the protocol for the steered simulations in this work . This , as a result , lends credence to the kinetic predictions of the model , and allowed us to compare the resulting timescales with the experimental observations . However , in order to boost evidence for the validity of the obtained free en - ergy landscapes , reverse steered simulations , in which a formed invagination is ﬂattened out via the action of ex - ternal forces can also be performed . As reliably perform - ing these would require major modiﬁcations of our sim - ulation protocol , we leave it to future works ; yet strongly emphasize its necessity for validation of the quantiﬁed data . Also , we should point out that one common un - certainty overshadowing this and similar analyses is the effect that the particular choice of collective variable has on the free energy estimation . In worst cases , energy barriers might be overlooked by projecting the dynamics along a speciﬁc direction . In our simulations , we considered proteins with two different stiffness values of 100 MPa and 200 MPa , which corresponds to the elastic model we previously devel - oped for these peripheral proteins [ 24 , 36 ] . The free energy proﬁles that we obtained for these two proteins share the general trend of energy barriers before spon - taneous aggregation and formation of shallow pits . How - ever , stiffer 200 MPa proteins experience signiﬁcantly lower barriers , and they also lead to successful develop - ment of the pit into a membrane invagination . From the perspective of the theoretical treatment of membrane - mediated interactions , proteins that induce same - sign isotropic curvatures should repel each other [ 49 , 50 ] . On the other hand , stiff - binding proteins that locally sup - press membrane ﬂuctuations experience attractive inter - actions , in what has been dubbed the thermal Casimir effect [ 50 – 52 ] . Both these pictures are idealized theoret - ical models pertaining to dilute systems of proteins , ne - glecting multi - body effects and contributions due to pro - teins being in close vicinity . In a dynamic and dense as - sembly of stiff - binding proteins , signiﬁcant forces lead - ing to aggregation may be present [ 36 , 53 ] . This seems to be the case in our simulations as well , with 200 MPa proteins having a higher tendency of forming pits that ultimately develop into invaginations . We have modeled the invagination process as occur - ring under the inﬂuence of proteins already bound to the membrane and not being adsorbed during the de - formation . This follows the experimental observation of STxB’s binding to GUV’s and forming dense clus - ters before any invaginations are observed [ 8 ] . The recruitment and binding of toxins such as Shiga and 7 Cholera with pentameric membrane - binding subunits is in itself a process worthy of detailed study [ 54 ] , and can be addressed in mesoscopic simulations with other free energy methods [ 55 ] . It is imaginable that includ - ing a reservoir of proteins ready to be recruited [ 56 ] or performing grand canonical simulations can lead to smoother energy landscapes and faster kinetics . We can imagine the general approach laid out in this work to be applicable to a variety of similar systems , es - pecially including BAR - domain proteins with anisotropic curvatures . Our approach to estimating the free energy of these complex membrane and protein systems re - sults in detailed landscapes across a very wide range of protein aggregation and membrane deformation . Thus , it can help provide mechanistic understanding of pro - cesses such as clathrin - independent endocytosis [ 57 ] , or endoplasmic reticulum reorganization [ 58 ] at their na - tive scale . Besides using more realizations of steered simulations and improving estimation accuracies , our approach is amenable to further improvement in the fu - ture via : ( i ) using more realistic models of peripheral pro - teins interacting with the membrane , ( ii ) including mem - brane tension as an important factor in the invagination process , and ( iii ) including effects due to the presence of cytoskeletal structures . We believe the tools developed in our modeling framework and the introduced methods for free energy estimation and kinetics analysis pave the way forward for including these effects and investigat - ing the mentioned scenarios to offer powerful means of quantitatively understanding membrane - protein inter - play at biologically interesting spatiotemporal scales .
