Quax , PhD Background - — In order to identify factors that stimulate arteriogenesis after ischemia , we followed gene expression pro ﬁ les in two extreme models for collateral artery formation over 28 days after hindlimb ischemia , namely “ good - responding ” C57BL / 6 mice and “ poor - responding ” BALB / c mice . Methods and Results - — Although BALB / c mice show very poor blood ﬂ ow recovery after ischemia , most known proarteriogenic genes were upregulated more excessively and for a longer period than in C57BL / 6 mice . In clear contrast , chemokine genes Ccl19 , Ccl21a , and Ccl21c and the chemokine receptor CCR7 were upregulated in C57BL / 6 mice 1 day after hindlimb ischemia , but not in BALB / C mice . CCL19 and CCL21 regulate migration and homing of T lymphocytes via CCR7 . When subjecting CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) / LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice to hindlimb ischemia , we observed a 20 % reduction in blood ﬂ ow recovery compared with that in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Equal numbers of a - smooth muscle actin – positive collateral arteries were found in the adductor muscles of both mouse strains , but collateral diameters were smaller in the CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) / LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) . Fluorescence - activated cell sorter analyses showed that numbers of CCR7 + T lymphocytes ( both CD4 + and CD8 + ) were decreased in the spleen and increased in the blood at day 1 after hindlimb ischemia in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . At day 1 after hindlimb ischemia , however , numbers of activated CD4 + T lymphocytes were decreased in the draining lymph nodes of LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared with CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) / LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Conclusions - — These data show that CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis facilitates retention CD4 + T lymphocytes at the site of collateral artery remodeling , which is essential for effective arteriogenesis .

Whereas angiogenesis , the hypoxia - induced sprouting of new capillaries from the existing microvasculature , can only improve distribution of the available blood through ischemic tissues , arteriogenesis can restore the actual blood supply to tissues downstream of an arterial occlusion . Arteriogenesis is de ﬁ ned as the maturation of preexisting arterioles into fully functional mature collateral arteries . 1 Arteriogenesis is triggered by increased shear stress and subsequent in ﬂ ammatory processes in arterioles . Under healthy conditions , blood ﬂ ow through the arteriole network is extremely low . But , when an artery becomes occluded , blood is redirected through the arterioles , drasti - cally increasing blood ﬂ ow , ﬂ uid shear stress , and circumfer - ential stretch on the arteriole wall . Increased shear stress stimulates endothelial cells in the arteriole wall to express adhesion molecules and secrete chemokines and cytokines . This leads to the attraction , adhesion , and invasion of monocytes / macrophages , 2 – 7 but also of other circulating From the Department of Surgery ( A . Y . N . , A . J . N . M . B . , E . A .

They produce growth factors and matrix metalloproteases to enable rearrangement of the extracellular matrix , providing space for the maturing collat - erals to grow . Smooth muscle cells change their phenotype from contractile to proliferative , causing expansion and growth of the vessel wall . The subsequent increase in vessel diameter eventually causes a decrease in ﬂ uid shear stress and circumferential stretch , which results in cessation of the arteriogenic process . Smooth muscle cells in the newly formed tunica media and activated ﬁ broblasts in the adven - titia secrete matrix components such as collagen and elastin to reconstitute the vessel wall . Arteriogenesis often fails to fully restore tissue perfusion in patients with peripheral arterial disease . Identi ﬁ cation of novel targets to stimulate arteriogenesis may offer new therapeutic opportunities for patients with severe peripheral arterial disease and critical limb ischemia . It is well - established that there are large differences in postischemic blood ﬂ ow recovery between C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice . 8 , 12 In 2007 , Chalothorn et al 13 ﬁ rst showed that both the number of preexisting collateral arterioles present and their capacity to remodel into mature collateral arteries varies greatly between different mouse strains . C57BL / 6 mice have a high density of preexisting collateral arteries and possess excellent remodeling capacity , when triggered . BALB / c mice , on the other hand , have virtually no preexisting collateral arteries and , on top of that , display a severely hampered response when triggered . 13 , 14 By whole genome expression analysis , we made use of the difference between both mouse strains to identify pathways that are crucial for collateral artery remodeling after induction of ischemia . Via the chemokine receptor CCR7 , chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 regulate migration and homing of dendritic cells and T lymphocytes to lymphoid and peripheral tissues during in ﬂ ammatory reactions . 15 – 17 In the current study , we show that the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis is differentially regulated at the site of arteriogenesis between C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice after hindlimb ischemia ( HLI ) . We further demonstrate that the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis is an important contributor to effective arteriogenesis after ischemia by facilitating appro - priate tissue retention of CCR7 + T lymphocytes at the site of collateral arteriole remodeling . Methods HLI Model All animal experiments were approved by the committee on animal welfare of the Leiden University Medical Center ( Leiden , The Netherlands ) . Mice ( BALB / c , C57BL / 6 , C57BL / 6 - LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) or C57BL / 6 - LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) , all male , aged 8 – 12 weeks ) were anes - thetized by intraperitoneal injection of midazolam ( 8 mg / kg , Roche Diagnostics ) , medetomidine ( 0 . 4 mg / kg , Orion ) , and fentanyl ( 0 . 08 mg / kg , Janssen Pharmaceuticals ) . Unilateral HLI was induced by electrocoagulation of the left femoral artery proximal to the super ﬁ cial epigastric arteries . After surgery , anesthesia was antagonized with ﬂ umazenil ( 0 . 7 mg / kg , Fresenius Kabi ) , atipamezole ( 3 . 3 mg / kg , Orion ) , and buprenorphine ( 0 . 2 mg / kg , MSD Animal Health ) . Blood ﬂ ow recovery to the paw was measured over time using laser Doppler perfusion imaging ( LDPI ) ( Moore Instru - ments ) . Mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of midazolam ( 8 mg / kg ) and medetomidine ( 0 . 4 mg / kg ) . Mice were placed in a double - glazed pot and perfused with water at 37 ° C for 5 minutes prior to each measurement . After LDPI , anesthesia was antagonized by subcutaneous injection of ﬂ umazenil ( 0 . 7 mg / kg ) and atipamezole ( 3 . 3 mg / kg ) . LDPI measurements in the treated paw were normalized to measurements of the untreated paw , as internal control . Serum cholesterol levels were determined before surgery ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Aortic Ring Assay Mouse aortic ring assays were performed as previously described . 18 In brief , the thoracic aorta was removed from 8 - to 10 - week - old mice and transferred to a petri dish containing Opti - MEM ( Gibco ) . The surrounding fat and branching vessels were carefully removed and the aorta was ﬂ ushed with Opti - MEM ( Gibco ) . Aortic rings of 0 . 5 to 1 mm were transferred to fresh Opti - MEM and serum - starved overnight . Collagen ( type I , Millipore ) was diluted to a concentration of 1 mg / mL with 1x DMEM ( Gibco ) and pH was adjusted with 5 N NaOH . Ninety - six well - plates were coated with 75 l L collagen matrix . Rings were transferred into the wells and after 1 hour , 150 l L Opti - MEM supplemented with 2 . 5 % FBS ( PAA , Austria ) , penicillin - streptomycin ( PAA , Austria ) , and 30 ng / mL vascular endothe - lial growth factor ( in - house production and puri ﬁ cation ) was added to each well . The medium was changed ﬁ rst on day 3 , then every other day . Microvessel outgrowth was quanti ﬁ ed after 7 days by live phase - contrast microscopy ( Axiovert 40C , Carl Zeiss ) . Starting from a speci ﬁ c point on the ring , each microvessel emerging from the ring was counted as a sprout and individual branches arising from each microvessel counted as a separate sprout , working around the ring clockwise . An in vivo angiogenesis analysis was previously described . 19 Cold ( 4 ° C ) growth factor reduced Matrigel ( 0 . 5 mL ) ( BD Biosciences ) was injected into the subcutaneous space on the dorsal side of LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) or LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice on both the left and right ﬂ ank under anesthesia induced DOI : 10 . 1161 / JAHA . 116 . 005281 Journal of the American Heart Association 2 CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 in Arteriogenesis Nossent et al O R I G I N A L R E S EA R C H by iso ﬂ urane inhalation . Mice were sacri ﬁ ced 7 days postim - plantation . Matrigel plugs were excised and processed for histological analysis . Paraf ﬁ n sections ( 5 l m ) were stained with hematoxylin - phloxine - saffron or anti - CD31 ( PECAM , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) . Vascular ingrowth was scored by measuring the maximum ingrowth depth of capillary struc - tures in 6 hematoxylin - phloxine - saffron – stained sections per plug ( 1 plug per mouse , 7 mice per group , expressed in l m ) . Quanti ﬁ cation was performed in a double - blinded fashion by 2 individuals using morphometric image analysis methods ( Qwin , Leica Imaging Systems ) . The endothelial nature of the in ﬁ ltrating cells was con ﬁ rmed by staining for CD31 . Gene Expression C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice were sacri ﬁ ced by cervical dislocation and the adductor muscle group medial to the femur was excised en bloc before ( pretreatment = pt ) and at different time points ( days 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , and 28 ) after induction of HLI . The tissue was snap - frozen , crushed using mortar and pestle , and homogenized over a Qiashredder ( Qiagen ) . Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy ﬁ brous tissue minikit ( Qiagen ) and RNA integrity was checked by NanoDrop ( NanoDrop Technologies ) and Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies ) . For whole - genome expression pro ﬁ ling , ampli ﬁ ed biotiny - lated RNA was generated using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Ampli ﬁ cation Kit . For array analysis , MouseWG - 6 v2 . 0 Expression BeadChips ( Illumina ) , which contain more than 45 200 transcripts , were used . Expression levels were log2 - transformed and quantile normalized . Transcripts showing background intensity ( log2 expression of < 6 . 75 ) both at baseline and after induction of HLI , were removed from the analysis . Genes were collapsed on gene symbol , thus averaging transcript variants . To detect differences in fold change expression relative to pt between the two mouse strains , values were expressed as ratios relative to pt and all samples were compared with all other samples by Bayes - regularized 1 - way ANOVA ( developed for microArray data with multiple conditions ) , with additional Tukey ’ s honest signi ﬁ cant difference post hoc multiple comparisons test to determine which pairs of groups showed differential expression , applying a P value of 0 . 05 . 20 Statistical Analysis of MicroArray Data 21 was used for a multiclass analysis on all time points within each mouse strain to detect signi ﬁ cant changes in expression at 1 or more time points . The immune responses of BALB / c and C57BL / 6 mice were compared by selecting all gene names containing at least 1 of the following terms : inter - leukin , chemokine , interferon , transforming growth factor , and tumor necrosis factor . For individual gene expression , total RNA was reverse - transcribed using High - Capacity RNA - to - cDNA Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . Quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) was performed on the ABI 7500 Fast system , using commer - cially available TaqMan gene expression assays for murine CCL19 , CCL21a , and CCR7 ( Applied Biosystems ) . Cycle threshold values were normalized against HPRT1 . Preexisting Collateral Density Methods for measurement of collateral density between the anterior cerebral artery , middle cerebral artery , and posterior cerebral artery were described elsewhere . 14 , 22 , 23 Brie ﬂ y , animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of midazolam ( 8 mg / kg , Roche Diagnostics ) , medetomidine ( 0 . 4 mg / kg , Orion ) , and fentanyl ( 0 . 08 mg / kg , Janssen Phar - maceutica ) and heparinized systemically . Maximal vasodilation was accomplished by canulation of the thoracic aorta and infusion of sodium - nitroprusside ( 30 l g / mL ) and papaverine ( 40 l g / mL ) in PBS at (cid:3) 100 mm Hg prior to vascular casting . Yellow Micro ﬁ l ( Flow Tech Inc . ) with adjusted viscosity , preventing capillary and venous ﬁ lling , was infused under a stereomicroscope after craniotomy . The dorsal cerebral circu - lation was ﬁ xed with topical application of 4 % paraformalde - hyde to prevent any reduction in vessel dimensions after Micro ﬁ l injection . Whole brains were ﬁ xed overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde and subsequently incubated in Evans Blue ( 2 l g / mL in 4 % paraformaldehyde ) for several days to improve contrast for visualization of the vasculature . Digital images were obtained of the dorsal brain surface and processed with ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) . Collateral density was calculated by determining the total number of pial collaterals between the anterior cerebral artery – middle cere - bral artery , anterior cerebral artery – posterior cerebral artery , and middle cerebral artery – posterior cerebral artery and dividing by the dorsal surface area of the cerebral hemispheres . Areas that sustained damage , were incompletely ﬁ lled , or were otherwise uncountable , were excluded from analysis . Immunohistochemistry For harvesting tissues , C57BL / 6 , LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) , and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injec - tion of midazolam ( 8 mg / kg , Roche Diagnostics ) , medeto - midine ( 0 . 4 mg / kg , Orion ) , and fentanyl ( 0 . 08 mg / kg , Janssen Pharmaceutica ) . Mice were sacri ﬁ ced by exsan - guination . The adductor muscle group and gastrocnemius muscle were harvested and snap - frozen or ﬁ xed in 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde . CCR7 Adductor muscle groups of wild - type C57BL / 6 mice before and 1 day after induction of HLI were used for histological analysis of CCR7 + cells using anti - CCR7 ( Abcam ) . Randomly photographed images were used to quantify the number of DOI : 10 . 1161 / JAHA . 116 . 005281 Journal of the American Heart Association 3 CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 in Arteriogenesis Nossent et al O R I G I N A L R E S EA R C H CCR7 + cells per section ( total of 9 images of 3 sections per mouse ) . Anti – a - smooth muscle actin Serial 5 - l m - thick paraf ﬁ n - embedded sections were used for histological analysis of collateral artery number and size . Vessels at the midpoint of the adductor muscle group , stained using anti – a - smooth muscle actin ( anti – a - SMA ) ( DAKO ) , are likely composed of collaterals but may also include arterioles of the opposing tree . Randomly photographed images through the central part of the adductor muscle group were used to quantify the number and lumen diameter of a - SMA + vessels using ImageJ software ( total of 9 images of 3 sections per limb per mouse ) . To correct for nonperpendicularly cut sections , the circular lumen area of a - SMA + vessels was calculated from the lumen diameter measured at the narrowest point . CD31 Serial frozen sections ( 6 l m ) of ligated and nonligated gastrocnemius muscle ( 10 days after HLI ) were ﬁ xed in ice - cold acetone and used for histological analyses of capillary density . Sections were stained using anti - CD31 ( BD Bio - sciences ) . Randomly photographed images through the gas - trocnemius muscles were used to quantify the number of CD31 + vessels per section using ImageJ software ( total 6 sections per limb per mouse ) . Fluorescent triple staining a - SMA / CCL19 / lymphatic vascular endothelial hyaluronan receptor - 1 Serial frozen sections ( 6 l m ) were ﬁ xed in ice - cold acetone after air drying . Before each staining , the tissue was blocked with a PBS solution of 3 % BSA and 2 % FCS to minimize nonspeci ﬁ c labeling . Sections were stained in the dark using anti – a - SMA antibody conjugated with a Cy3 ﬂ uorochrome ( Sigma ) , goat anti - CCL19 antibody ( R & D systems ) with secondary anti - goat antibody conjugated with an Alexa 488 ﬂ uorochrome ( Molecular Probes ) , rat anti – lymphatic vascular endothelial hyaluronan receptor - 1 ( LYVE - 1 ) antibody ( eBio - sciences ) with secondary anti - rat antibody conjugated with an APC - labeled ﬂ uorochrome ( eBiosciences ) , and Vectashield ( Vector Labs ) for cell nuclear staining . Randomly pho - tographed images through the distal part of the adductor muscle group were taken on a , LSM700 microscope and contrast - stretched using Zen 2009 software ( Carl Zeiss ) . Flow Cytometry Blood , spleen , peritoneal leukocytes , and mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested from C57BL / 6 , BALB / c , and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Blood , spleen , bone marrow , and nondraining lymph nodes were harvested before ( pt ) and 1 day after induction of HLI in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Draining lymph nodes were dissected from the ipsilateral inguinal region , nondraining form the contralateral iguinal region . Total circulating leukocytes were measured using a KX - 21N Hema - tology Analyzer ( Sysmex ) . Tissues were minced through a 40 - l m cell strainer ( BD Biosciences ) to obtain single - cell suspensions , which were resuspended in Iscove ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Dulbecco ’ s Medium ( Lonza ) with 2 % FCS . For DC - speci ﬁ c cell surface staining , the spleen and lymph nodes were ﬁ rst perfused with collagenase ( 1 mg / mL ) and DNase ( 0 . 02 mg / mL ) for 10 minutes and minced . Erythrocytes were lysed and samples for intracellular staining were permeabilized . Fluo - rochrome - conjugated monoclonal antibodies speci ﬁ c for CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD11c , CD11b , CD19 , CD25 , CD86 , CD115 , FoxP3 , Ly6C , Ly6G , B220 , DX5 , MHCII , CCR7 , CCR2 , F4 / 80 , CD62L , IL12 , IL10 , NK1 . 1 , and Tbet were used . Statistical Analyses Results are presented as mean (cid:4) SEM . Comparisons between groups were performed using Student t test or 1 - way ANOVA . As LDPI measurements were performed on the same LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice over time , these data were also analyzed using a repeated measures two - way ANOVA . Statis - tical analyses were performed using SPSS 17 . 0 software ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL ) and GraphPad Prism 6 ( La Jolla , CA ) . P < 0 . 05 values were considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . Results Blood Flow Recovery in C57BL / 6 and BALB / c Mice HLI was induced in C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice by single coagulation of the left femoral artery and blood ﬂ ow recovery was measured by LDPI ( Figure 1A and 1B ) . As was previously reported , 8 , 12 – 14 blood ﬂ ow recovery was heavily impaired in BALB / c mice directly after HLI ( Figure 1C , P < 0 . 001 ) and did not recover at all before termination at 28 days . C57BL / 6 mice , on theother hand , madea full recovery within 7 days . The observed difference in residual ﬂ ow between the 2 strains directly after femoral artery ligation con ﬁ rms the previously reported differ - ences in the number of preexisting collateral arterioles . 13 , 14 The difference in recovery rates further demonstrates the difference in remodeling capacity between the two strains . Postischemic Gene Expression In the HLI model , arteriogenesis takes place mainly in the adductor muscle . To include collateral arterial tissue , but also in ﬁ ltrating leukocytes , but not the draining lymph nodes , we performed microarray whole - genome expression analyses on DOI : 10 . 1161 / JAHA . 116 . 005281 Journal of the American Heart Association 4 CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 in Arteriogenesis Nossent et al O R I G I N A L R E S EA R C H total adductor muscle mRNA of C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice before ( pt ) and at days 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , and 28 after induction of HLI ( Figure 2 ) . Of the 20 . 910 genes that were expressed above background signal , 3 . 729 genes were signi ﬁ cantly upregulated or downregulated over time in C57BL / 6 mice ( signi ﬁ cance analysis of microarrays , q < 5 % ) , of which 786 genes were upregulated already at day 1 after induction of HLI . In BALB / c mice , we observed a more exaggerated response ; 6 . 876 genes were upregulated or downregulated over time , of which 809 genes were upregulated at day 1 ( q < 5 % ) . Looking at the heatmap of those genes that are upregulated at day 1 in either C57BL / 6 or BALB / c mice , or in both , it becomes apparent that there is great overlap in gene sets between the two strains ( Figure 3A ) . However , where this upregulation is fast and transient in the C57BL / 6 , mice a delayed and prolonged response is observed in BALB / c mice . As arteriogenesis is an in ﬂ ammation - driven process , we selected genes related to in ﬂ ammation that signi ﬁ cantly changed over time in either C57BL / 6 mice or BALB / c mice or in both ( Figure 3B ) . As shown before , 24 – 27 BALB / c and C57BL / 6 mice demonstrated several differences in their immune response over time . Similar to what is described above , the in ﬂ ammatory response of the C57BL / 6 mice was fast but transient , whereas this response was prolonged in BALB / c mice . However , we observed that chemokine genes Ccl19 , Ccl21a , and Ccl21c were upregulated in C57BL / 6 but not BALB / c mice . Expression of the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 Axis To verify at which time points the expression of Ccl19 , Ccl21a , and Ccl21c was more induced in the adductor muscle of C57BL / 6 mice compared with BALB / c mice , we performed a Bayesian ANOVA analysis on all expressed genes at all time points , relative to baseline expression levels . After only 1 day of HLI , the expression of the 3 chemokines was signi ﬁ cantly more induced in C57BL / 6 versus BALB / C adductor muscle ( P = 0 . 00002 , 0 . 0017 , and 0 . 019 , respectively ; data not shown ) . We con ﬁ rmed these ﬁ ndings by real - time qPCR ( RT / qPCR ) in the adductor muscle ( Figure 4A through 4C ) . RT / qPCR showed that Ccr7 was also upregulated in the Figure 1 .

This response was transient and levels had normalized by day 3 . In the ischemic gastrocnemius muscle , this pattern was not observed , but Ccl19 and Ccr7 showed delayed and prolonged upregulation in BALB / c mice ( Figure 4D through 4F ) . When staining for CCR7 in the perivascular space around remodeling collateral arterioles in the adductor muscle of C57BL / 6 , 1 day after induction of ischemia , we observed a trend towards increased numbers of CCR7 + cells , compared with before the induction of ischemia ( Figure 4G , P = 0 . 07 ) . Because of the involvement in migration of lymphocytes from the circulation , through the peripheral tissue into lymphoid vessels , we then performed a triple staining for CCL19 with a - SMA and LYVE - 1 as a marker of lymphoid vessels . CCL19 did not colocalize with lymphoid vessels , but was observed predominantly in the muscle tissue , in close proximity to a - SMA + arterioles ( Figure 4H ) . Blood Flow Recovery in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) Mice To further establish the role of the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis , we studied blood ﬂ ow recovery after HLI in CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . These mice were bred on a C57BL / 6 / LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) background and , therefore , we used C57BL / 6 / LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice as controls . The mice were kept on a normal chow diet and plasma total cholesterol levels were similar in both groups ( Figure 5A ) . In both groups , mice appeared healthy and did not show signi ﬁ cant weight loss over the course of the experiment ( Figure 5B ) .

In LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , however , blood ﬂ ow recovery was signi ﬁ cantly hampered from day 10 onward ( LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) 0 . 95 (cid:4) 0 . 04 versus LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) 0 . 76 (cid:4) 0 . 04 , P = 0 . 003 ) and full recovery was not reached before sacri ﬁ ce at day 21 ( Figure 6A and 6B ) . Over the whole time period , blood ﬂ ow recovery was signi ﬁ cantly impaired in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) compared with LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( P = 0 . 0186 ) . Directly after ligation , however , perfusion was similar in both groups ( Figure 6C ) . This indicates that numbers of preexisting collat - eral arterioles are similar between both mouse strains . Indeed , when we quanti ﬁ ed the collateral circulation of the pia mater , which has been shown to be representative for collateral densities in muscle tissues , 14 , 22 , 23 similar numbers of collateral arterioles were counted in both strains ( Figure 6D and 6E ) . Arteriogenesis in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) Mice The impaired blood ﬂ ow recovery in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice was con ﬁ rmed by measuring the a - SMA + arterioles in the adductor muscle group 10 days after HLI ( Figure 6F ) . As predicted by the collateral densities of the pia mater , the number of a - SMA + arterioles was similar between LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figure 6G ) . Also , the lumen area of the a - SMA + vessel in the adductor muscle group of nonligated limbs was similar . However , the mean lumen area per a - SMA + vessel ( Figure 6H ; LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) 279 (cid:4) 31 l m 2 versus LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) 143 (cid:4) 8 l m 2 , P = 0 . 001 ) and total lumen area of a - SMA + vessels per section ( Figure 6I ; LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) 746 (cid:4) 90 l m 2 versus LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) 384 (cid:4) 36 l m 2 , P = 0 . 003 ) had increased more in the adductor muscle group of the ligated paw of LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice than in the LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Thus , CCR7 de ﬁ ciency results in impaired outward remodeling of collateral arterioles after induction of HLI . Angiogenesis in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) Mice We also quanti ﬁ ed the number of CD31 + capillaries in the gastrocnemius muscles ( Figure 6J ) . Unlike the effects of CCR7 de ﬁ ciency on arteriogenesis , angiogenesis was not severely affected in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Even though the ratio of capillary densities in the ischemic over the nonischemic calf appeared lower in the LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared with the LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , indicating decreased ischemia - induced angiogenesis , this difference was not signi ﬁ cant ( Figure 6K ; ratio of ischemic to nonischemic gastrocnemius : 1 . 31 (cid:4) 0 . 20 in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) versus 0 . 95 (cid:4) 0 . 19 in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) , P = 0 . 22 ) . We further observed that in an in vivo angiogenesis model , LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice showed similar ingrowth of CD31 + endothelial cells into the subcutaneous matrigel plug as LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . However , in an ex vivo aortic ring assay , we observed a decrease in the number of sprouts growing out of LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) aortas compared with LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) aortas . These data imply that CCR7 does affect arterial but not venous remodeling and growth ( Figure 7 ) . Baseline Leukocyte Phenotype The CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis plays a crucial role in migra - tion , homing , and retention of DCs and T lymphocytes . As the CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice used for this study were bred on an LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) background , we ﬁ rst compared baseline leukocyte pro ﬁ les in peripheral blood , spleen , and lymph nodes of C57BL / 6 - LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice with those of wild - type C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice . When looking at DCs , we observed several differences in numbers of DCs in the various compartments between C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice and between LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) and BALB / c mice . For instance , total DCs , CCR7 + DCs , and MHCII high / CCR7 + DCs were lower in the lymph nodes of BALB / c mice than in the other two strains ( Figure 8A through 8C ) , whereas the MHCII high / CCR7 + DCs were particularly Figure 5 .

CD4 + / CCR7 + T lymphocytes , but not CD8 + / CCR7 + T lymphocytes , were also increased in the spleen of BALB / c mice ( Figure 8E and 8F ) . Furthermore , Foxp3 + / CD4 + T regulatory lymphocytes were also increased in both the spleen and lymph nodes of BALB / c mice , compared with the other two strains ( Figure 8G and 8H ) . However , no differences in either DCs or T lymphocytes were observed between the C57BL / 6 and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice in any tissue . With regards to the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis , we concluded that wild - type C57BL / 6 and C57BL / 6 LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) have a similar leukocyte phenotype at baseline . However , we did observe an increase in CD14 + / CCR7 + monocytes and F4 / 80 + / CCR7 + macrophages in the peritoneum of LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared with both C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice at baseline ( Figure 8I and 8J ) but not in other tissues including the blood , spleen , and lymph nodes ( Figure 9 ) . Postischemic Leukocyte Mobilization Although they play a major role in arteriogenesis , we observed no differences in monocytes and macrophages between LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice after HLI ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we focused on the mobilization of T lymphocytes and DCs after induction of HLI . Total numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes did not differ between both mouse strains ( data not shown ) . When we looked at activated and nave T lymphocytes separately , we noticed that for both CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes , numbers of activated cells in the spleen dramatically decreased after induction of HLI , whereas the naive cells increased in numbers . This was true for both the LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figure 10A through 10D ) . Similarly , for CD4 + T lymphocytes , the number of activated cells in the peripheral blood increased , where the number of naive cells decreased , in both mouse strains ( Figure 10E and 10F ) . For CD8 + T lymphocytes , however , this was only true in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , whereas in the LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , numbers of both activated and naive CD8 + T lymphocytes remained unaltered after induction of HLI ( Figure 10G and 10H ) . However , even though the pool of activated T lymphocytes in the spleen was drained at day 1 after HLI , a decrease of activated CD4 + and CD8 + T lympho - cytes , in particular , was observed in the lymph nodes of LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . These effects were most outspoken for activated CD4 + T lymphocytes in the draining lymph nodes , indicating that these are cells being retained in the affected tissue , enabling them to exert their function in arteriogenesis . In the LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , these effects were not observed , which indicates an impaired retention of T lymphocytes at the site of collateral remodeling ( Figure 10I through 10L ) . The fraction of in ﬂ ammatory DCs also decreased in the spleen of LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) but not LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice at 1 day after induction of ischemia , whereas the fraction of tolero - genic DCs was unchanged in the spleen in both mouse strains ( Figure 10M and 10N ) . Numbers of DCs in the peripheral blood were too low to generate reliable data on changes in DC numbers after HLI ( data not shown ) . The fraction of activated in ﬂ ammatory and tolerogenic DCs also increased in lymph nodes , but the increase was more outspoken in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , indicating that DCs also failed to retain in adductor muscle of these mice . However , in contrast to activated CD4 + T lymphocytes , these effects were observed in both draining and nondraining lymph nodes . Therefore , DC retention is most likely not speci ﬁ c to remodeling collateral arterioles ( Figure 10O and 10P ) . Discussion In this study , we show that the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis is essential for effective arteriogenesis in a murine HLI model . We made use of the large differences in collateral arteriole remodeling capacities between C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice , which led to the identi ﬁ cation of the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis as one of the “ missing links ” in arteriogenesis in BALB / c mice .

The C57BL / 6 mouse has an extensive preexisting network of collateral arterioles and , when triggered , these arterioles rapidly remodel into functional collateral arteries . The BALB / c mouse on the other hand , has only a few preexisting collateral arterioles and these arterioles have a very limited capacity to remodel into functional collateral arteries . 8 , 12 – 14 This striking difference between the two strains triggered the group of James Faber to perform in - depth studies into the genetic makeup of these and other mouse strains . They have linked up to 40 % of the variation in collateral arteriole formation to a single locus , Canq1 , on murine chromosome 7 . 22 , 23 , 28 When looking at differences in gene expression , however , in the adductor muscles of both mouse strains , we observed that the response to HLI is much more outspoken in BALB / c mice than in C57BL / 6 mice . More genes are regulated in BALB / c mice and for a more prolonged period of time . The response in BALB / c mice is delayed compared with that in the C57BL / 6 mice ; however , that would only explain a slightly delayed recovery of blood ﬂ ow , but not the complete absence of recovery over 28 days . Therefore , it seems more likely that , although the BALB / c mice appear to “ try their best , ” by activating all proarteriogenic and proangiogenic gene pro - grams , one or several factors are missing , which leads to the ultimate failure in blood ﬂ ow recovery . A previous study by Lee et al 29 showed that there is a large in ﬂ ammatory component to postischemic gene regulation in C57BL / 6 mice . In a model for acute cerebral stroke in C57BL / 6 mice , Offner et al 30 also showed rapid and broad activation of the peripheral immune system . Just as we observed in the C57BL / 6 mice , CCR7 was upregulated in the ischemic tissue at (cid:3) 1 day ( 22 hours ) after Figure 7 . Angiogenesis assays in vivo and ex vivo .

Upregulation of CCR7 in the spleen was already observed within 6 hours . Correspondingly , 2 studies in humans showed depletion of CCR7 expression in the acute phase in the peripheral blood of patients with ischemic stroke , likely due to in ﬁ ltration of circulating CCR7 + cells into the cerebral tissue . 31 One week after stroke , however , the number of CCR7 + T lymphocytes dramatically increased in the peripheral blood of stroke patients . 32 Similar effects were observed following acute myocardial infarction , where CCR7 + T lymphocytes were rapidly depleted from the peripheral blood of patients directly after reperfusion , only to increase again in the hours after intervention . 33 . For the ﬁ rst time , we report increased expression of CCR7 ligands Ccl19 and Ccl21 in the affected adductor muscle of C57BL / 6 but not BALB / c mice . When we costained CCL19 expression in adductor muscle tissue at day 1 after induction of HLI with both a - SMA and LYVE - 1 , we noticed that the upregulation of CCL19 predominantly occurred in the perivas - cular tissue itself , not in the lymphoid vessels . This corre - sponds to the increase in the number of CCR7 + cells in the perivascular space at day 1 after HLI that we observed in the adductor muscles of C57BL / 6 mice , but also with the depletion of activated CD4 + T lymphocytes speci ﬁ cally in the draining lymph nodes of LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared with LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice at day 1 after HLI .

In atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction , the axis has been shown to play an important role . However , whereas on an ApoE (cid:1) / (cid:1) background , CCR7 de ﬁ ciency aggravates atherosclerosis in hypercholes - terolemic mice , CCR7 de ﬁ ciency reduces plaque formation in mice with an LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) background . 37 – 39 In human patients with atherosclerosis , CCR7 and its ligands CCL19 and CCL21 have been shown to be increased in both coronary and carotid artery lesions . 40 , 41 The main difference between atherosclero - sis and arteriogenesis with respect to the in ﬂ ammatory response is that while in ﬂ ammation is chronic in atheroscle - rosis , it is only transient in effective arteriogenesis . Different types of immune cells in ﬁ ltrate the affected tissues in a tightly registered order and the in ﬂ ammatory response is ceased again within days . 42 However , when arteriogenesis is not effective , like in BALB / c , the in ﬂ ammatory reaction is prolonged and more chronic in character .

DOI : 10 . 1161 / JAHA . 116 . 005281 Journal of the American Heart Association 15 CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 in Arteriogenesis Nossent et al O R I G I N A L R E S EA R C H and Ccl21 , and the retention of CCR7 + in the adductor muscle tissue , are only transient in C57BL / 6 and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . A weakness of this study is that technical restrictions in immunohistochemistry did not allow us to con ﬁ rm that the CCR7 + cells in the adductor muscle at day 1 are indeed activated CD4 + T lymphocytes . CCR7 is expressed on many types of leukocytes , but mainly on the various subtypes of T lymphocytes and ( matured ) DCs , of which CD4 + T lympho - cytes play a con ﬁ rmed role in arteriogenesis . 8 More impor - tantly , this is the only cell type that is depleted speci ﬁ cally from the draining lymph nodes at day 1 . This depletion is more outspoken in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) than in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , which lack the ability to retain cells in the tissue via CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 interactions . An additional weakness is that we cannot rule out the effects of CCR7 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells . We did not observe accumu - lation of any type of leukocyte in the blood in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared with LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , which indi - cates that there is no defect in leukocyte extravasation . However , the aortic ring assay shows that angiogenic sprouting from aorta segments is enhanced by the presence of CCR7 , without an external stimulus . Therefore , an additional role of smooth muscle cells is not unlikely . In correspondence to the upregulation of the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis in the good - responding C57BL / 6 mice , we found that CCR7 de ﬁ ciency leads to a hampered recovery of blood ﬂ ow after HLI . As both LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) and LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice had a similar number of preexist - ing collateral arterioles in the pia mater and in the adductor muscle of the contralateral paw , the decrease in blood ﬂ ow recovery in LDLR (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CCR7 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice was caused solely by the decrease in arteriogenic capacity , not by changes in embryonic collateral arteriole formation . Although several studies have shown that CCR7 , via CCL21 , can increase angiogenesis in models for rheumatoid arthritis and cancer , 43 , 44 we did not observe decreases in angiogenesis in CCR7 - de ﬁ cient mice . Blood ﬂ ow recovery was hampered in CCR7 - de ﬁ cient mice , but the phenotype is not nearly as dramatic as it is in BALB / c mice . Part of this may be explained by the fact that CCR7 - de ﬁ cient animals do have an extensive preexisting collateral network , in contrast to BALB / c mice . However , looking at the maximal recovery of blood ﬂ ow , the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis is most likely only one of several crucial differences between the good - and poor - responding C57BL / 6 and BALB / c strains . Conclusions We found that most known in ﬂ ammatory genes are upregu - lated more strongly and for a prolonged period of time in the poor - responding BALB / c mouse strain in response to HLI . When looking for missing links in these mice , we found a lack of upregulation of the CCR7 - CCL19 / CCL21 axis , which we did observe in good - responding C57BL / 6 mice . CCR7 de ﬁ ciency indeed leads to a hampered blood ﬂ ow recovery after HLI , due to a decrease in arteriogenesis , but not in angiogenesis . Early and transient upregulation of Ccl19 and Ccl21 around remodeling collateral arterioles in the affected muscle tissue , not in the lymphoid vessels , leads to a transient retention of , what are most likely , CD4 + T lymphocytes in the tissue , allowing them to exert a positive role in the initial phase of arteriogenesis .
