Au - Yeung 1 and Winnie Yu 6 Abstract Background : Healthcare workers ( HCWs ) use personal protective equipment ( PPE ) in Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) situations . However , preventing the contamination of HCWs and the environment during PPE removal crucially requires improved strategies . This study aimed to compare the efficacy of three PPE ensembles , namely , Hospital Authority ( HA ) Standard Ebola PPE set ( PPE1 ) , Dupont Tyvek Model , style 1422A ( PPE2 ) , and HA isolation gown for routine patient care and performing aerosol - generating procedures ( PPE3 ) to prevent EVD transmission by measuring the degree of contamination of HCWs and the environment . Methods : A total of 59 participants randomly performed PPE donning and doffing . The trial consisted of PPE donning , applying fluorescent solution on the PPE surface , PPE doffing of participants , and estimation of the degree of contamination as indicated by the number of fluorescent stains on the working clothes and environment . Protocol deviations during PPE donning and doffing were monitored . Results : PPE2 and PPE3 presented higher contamination risks than PPE1 . Environmental contaminations such as those originating from rubbish bin covers , chairs , faucets , and sinks were detected . Procedure deviations were observed during PPE donning and doffing , with PPE1 presenting the lowest overall deviation rate ( % ) among the three PPE ensembles ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Conclusion : Contamination of the subjects ’ working clothes and surrounding environment occurred frequently during PPE doffing . Procedure deviations were observed during PPE donning and doffing . Although PPE1 presented a lower contamination risk than PPE2 and PPE3 during doffing and protocol deviations , the design of PPE1 can still be further improved . Future directions should focus on designing a high - coverage - area PPE with simple ergonomic features and on evaluating the doffing procedure to minimise the risk of recontamination . Regular training for users should be emphasised to minimise protocol deviations , and in turn , guarantee the best protection to HCWs . Introduction Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) is a severe infectious disease with a high fatality rate of approximately 50 % [ 1 ] . The virus in the blood and body fluids of a patient can enter another person ’ s body through skin lesions or mucous membranes of the eyes , nose or mouth . Therefore , health care workers ( HCWs ) should wear protective gear and adopt strict infection control measures when caring for suspected patients [ 2 , 3 ] . The EVD outbreak has recently prompted interest in personal protective equipment ( PPE ) apparel and their use [ 4 ] . PPE comprise gowns , gloves , hood , face shield , boots , masks or respirators , which are used to protect HCWs from contact with infectious agents . However , although equipped with protective clothing , HCWs can be contam - inated if the PPE apparel is improperly removed [ 3 ] .

Several healthcare organisations developed PPE protocols based on the best locally available components . However , HCWs may be hesitant to use a PPE with no empirical val - idation [ 4 ] . Thus , crucial precautions during PPE removal must be determined to effectively protect HCWs [ 6 ] . The Hospital Authority ( HA ) of Hong Kong is a statu - tory body that manages Hong Kong ’ s public hospital ser - vices [ 7 ] . The HA recommends a PPE ensemble with a neck - to - ankle overall without skin exposure to meet the current recommendations of the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention ( CDC ) on the PPE to be used by HCWs during management of patients with confirmed EVD [ 5 ] . A waterproof hood and a water - resistant gown were designed to cover the head , neck and body of HCWs . Previous studies [ 8 , 9 ] reported that a water - resistant gown can provide a good physical barrier via preventing the absorption of liquid contaminants , and thus , confer - ring protection to HCWs who come in contact with body fluids and secretions of patients with EVD . Our previous study has shown that the barrier protection performance and usability of PPEs are affected by the covered area and ergonomic features [ 8 ] . However , systematic data on the risk of self - contamination of different PPE types for Ebola prevention remain lacking . In the present study , three types of PPEs , namely , Hospital Authority Standard Ebola PPE set ( PPE1 ) , Dupont Tyvek Model , style 1422A ( PPE2 ) and HA isolation gown for routine patient care and per - forming aerosol - generating procedures ( PPE3 ) , were tested . We compared the PPE ensembles used to prevent EVD transmission in terms of protocol deviations during usage and the degree of contamination during doffing . Materials and methods This research was an experimental study of one group using multiple comparisons . Study participants A total of 59 HCWs were recruited for this study . The sample size was determined as previously described by Guo et al . [ 8 ] , who have examined body - contamination rates and environmental - contamination levels during doffing of different PPE types in accordance with the protocol recommended by the HA . Pregnant females and participants suffering from upper respiratory tract infection and respiratory diseases requiring treatment were excluded . Among the participants , 57 . 60 % ( n = 34 ) were female with an age range of 21 – 60 years old . The participants were either registered nurses ( n = 50 , 84 . 80 % ) , advanced prac - ticing nurses ( n = 4 , 6 . 80 % ) , nursing officers ( n = 3 , 5 . 10 % ) or nurse educators ( n = 2 , 3 . 40 % ) . The participants worked in units with high infection risk , including the intensive care unit , emergency department , infection control units and respiratory wards , accounting for 47 . 50 % ( n = 28 ) , whilst the rest worked in units with relatively low infection risk ( i . e . , other clinical units apart from the units mentioned above [ n = 31 , 52 . 50 % ] ) . All the participants have not yet worn PPE2 because this ensemble is generally not adopted in local hospitals for HCWs . Participants who are currently working in high - infection - risk units have more opportun - ities to wear PPE1 and PPE3 in daily practice . PPE ensembles under testing Three PPE ensembles were tested ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1 , Additional file 2 : Figure S2 , Additional file 3 : Figure S3 , Additional file 4 : Figure S4 , Additional file 5 : Figure S5 , Additional file 6 : Figure S6 ) . ( 1 ) HA standard Ebola PPE set ( PPE1 ) is a neck - to - ankle overall with an overlying water - resistant gown ( Halyard , AAMI Level 4 Liquid Barrier Standard ) , double and long nitrate gloves , boots , hood , disposable face shield and N95 respirator . A bow was tied at the lateral of the waist to minimise the risk of front contamination . ( 2 ) DuPont ™ Tyvek® , Model 1422A ( PPE2 ) is commonly adopted in clinical settings to prevent Ebola transmission in countries , such as the US [ 10 , 11 ] and South Korea [ 3 ] . Its protective clothing is also fluid resistant , but the design is a one - piece head - to - ankle overall with a zipper on the front . The whole outfit includes double gloves , boots , disposable face shield and an N95 respirator . A plastic apron was used to cover up the front zipper before use . ( 3 ) PPE3 is a HA isolation gown ( Medicom® ) for routine patient care and performing aerosol - generating proce - dures . PPE3 was selected as the reference PPE in the present study . A commercially available pure cotton sur - gical scrub suit ( upper and lower working clothes ) was worn inside the individual PPE ensembles during testing . Participants were free to select the appropriate size of gowns and gloves and the known best - fitted respirator model ( 3 M 1860 , 1860s and 1870 ) . Table 1 shows the comparison of the three PPE ensembles . Procedures Data collection was performed in an air - conditioned room with an average temperature of 23 °C ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 60 % ± 3 % . Information about the purpose and procedures of the study was provided to the participants , and written consent was obtained prior to the study . The participants ’ socio - demographic data , including gender , age , educational background , specialty , working units and clinical experience , were collected . Each subject received a 30 min briefing from a trained research personnel . The donning and doffing procedures for PPE1 and PPE3 were designed based on the recommendations by the HA , whilst the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) Suen et al . Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control ( 2018 ) 7 : 157 Page 2 of 9 protocol was followed for PPE2 doffing [ 12 ] . On the test - ing day , the participants watched a video about donning and doffing of the PPE ensembles to familiarise themselves with the procedures . The total duration for donning and doffing of PPEs in the videos was 8 . 74 , 10 . 68 and 4 . 59 min for PPE1 , PPE2 and PPE3 , respectively . Posters related to donning and doffing procedures were pinned up in the venue . Participants with long hair were asked to tie up their mane . Watch and jewellery were removed to minim - ise the risk of exposure during the procedures . Afterwards , the participants donned and doffed the three PPEs in a random order as decided by a computer - generated rando - mised table . The experiment was sequentially conducted in three areas . Area A was the ‘ clean zone ’ , where the participants donned the working clothes and clean PPE ensemble in front of a mirror . Area B was the ‘ preparation zone ’ , where the PPE of the participants was contaminated with a fluor - escent solution ( UV GERM Hygiene Spray , Glow Tec Ltd . , London , England ) that mimics contaminated bodily fluids or secretions spread via contact route . Fluorescent solution was sprayed onto the face shield , two upper limb / gloves and anterior surfaces of the gown at a distance of 60 cm from the participants , which represents the length of a stethoscope , simulating the usual working distance between a patient and an HCW [ 8 ] , with an average of 1 . 99 g fluorescent solution / per stroke [ 9 ] . This value was determined using an electronic analytical balance with a precision of 0 . 1 g ( NJW - 3000 , Xiangxin , Taipei , Taiwan ) via obtaining the average of 20 trial cases . A standard of three strokes was sprayed on each body part with a total of 12 strokes made for each case . The weight of the splash in 1 stroke was 1 . 99 g in this study when the density of the solution was assumed as 1 . Area C is the ‘ degown and test zone ’ , wherein the participants were required to doff the PPE . A video camera with a high - density capability was set up for subsequent evaluation of protocol deviations during donning and doffing . Protocol deviations are defined as accidental or noncompliance with the donning and doffing procedures of the PPEs under testing . The performance of the participants was monitored using a checklist . The participants were notified immediately of any deviation being committed . For evaluation , all proto - col deviations were recorded . The participants were timed and videotaped whilst donning and doffing the PPE . The timer was stopped when the participants removed the final item of the protective clothing . During the procedures , hand washing with liquid soap and water was performed according to the procedures of individual PPEs . Immediately after doffing , the partici - pants were scanned for the presence of fluorescent solu - tion . The participants ’ body ( hair and head , face , anterior / posterior neck , left / right arms , hands or wrists , upper / lower working clothes and clogs ) and the surrounding en - vironment ( rubbish bin cover , chair , faucet and sink ) were examined using an ultraviolet lamp ( CheckPoint , 220 – 240 V / 50 Hz ; Glow Tec Ltd . , London , England ) under dim light . Areas of contamination were counted and measured in square centimetres , and the fluorescent patches of different sizes were counted . Contaminated stains were defined as either small - ( ≤ 1cm 2 ) , medium - ( 1cm 2 to < 3cm 2 ) , large - ( ≥ 3cm 2 to 5cm 2 ) or extra - large patch ( ≥ 5cm 2 ) [ 8 , 13 , 14 ] . The number of contaminated patches and the time consumed by the participants during don - ning and doffing were recorded . The environment was thoroughly cleaned , and the areas were rechecked for any contamination with the ultraviolet lamp before the next trial . A 15 min break was given , and water was provided to the participants before testing the next PPE to prevent fatigue , which may affect performance . Statistical analyses All data were analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 . Descriptive statistics were used for all independent Table 1 Comparison of the three PPE ensembles Hospital Authority Standard Ebola PPE set ( PPE1 ) DuPont ™ Tyvek® , Model 1422A ( PPE2 ) Hospital Authority isolation gown for routine patient care and performing aerosol - generating procedures ( PPE 3 ) [ As a reference ] Neck - to - ankle outfit Head - to - ankle coverall Neck - to - ankle outfit N95 respirator N95 respirator N95 respirator Hood ( Kimberly Clark , model no . 25797 ) Hood with elasticated facial opening No hood Disposable face shield Disposable face shield Disposable face shield MICROCOOL Breathable High Performance Surgical Gown ( Halyard , AAMI Level 4 Liquid Barrier Standard ) a Tyvek , a brand of flash spun high - density polyethylene fibers , a synthetic material .

The contamination sites among the PPEs were compared with χ 2 or Fisher ’ s exact test as required . The degree of con - tamination during doffing and the time for PPE donning and doffing were compared using one - way ANOVA . Protocol deviations were expressed as the deviation rate ( % ) . All differences reported were considered significant at the p < 0 . 05 level . Results Degree of contamination during doffing Contamination by small patches on the working clothes of the wearers occurred less frequently during PPE1 removal than during PPE2 and PPE3 removal ( median : 5 . 00 versus 7 . 00 versus 7 . 00 , p < 0 . 05 ) . The degree of contamination by large patches occurred less frequently during the re - moval of PPE1 and PPE2 than during the removal of PPE3 ( median : 1 . 00 versus 1 . 00 versus 2 . 00 , p < 0 . 05 ) . No signifi - cant difference in medium - contaminated patches and number / area of extra - large contaminated patches was ob - served among the three PPEs . The older staff ( aged 41 – 50 and 51 – 60 years old ) featured significantly less - small con - taminated patches than that of the younger staff ( aged 21 – 30 and 31 – 40 years old ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) . No gender differ - ences were observed in the degree of contamination among the ensembles under testing . Moreover , HCWs working in units with relatively low infection risk showed significantly less small contaminated patches than those working in units with high infection risk ( median : 5 . 00 versus 8 . 00 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Contamination sites during doffing Table 2 shows the distribution of contaminated sites on the body and the surrounding environment during doff - ing . The overall contamination of PPE1 during doffing is relatively less than those of PPE2 and PPE3 , as indicated by either small - or extra - large contaminated patches . PPE2 is relatively more heavily contaminated than PPE1 during doffing in sites , such as hands and wrists , work - ing clothes and the environment ( chair ) . Meanwhile , PPE3 is more easily contaminated in the neck regions , clogs and arms than PPE1 . Donning and doffing protocol deviations Procedure deviations during donning and doffing of the PPEs were observed , with PPE1 exhibiting the lowest overall deviation rate among the three PPE ensembles during doffing ( 2 . 95 , 9 . 48 and 3 . 52 % for PPE1 , PPE2 and PPE3 , respectively ) . The top three highest deviation per - centages in each type of PPE are in bold ( Table 3 ) . Par - ticipants working in units with high infection risk presented significantly lower deviation rate than those working in units with low infection risk during donning of PPE1 and PPE2 , but no significant differences in the deviation rates can be observed among the groups dur - ing doffing of the three PPEs . Timing for PPE donning and doffing On the average , the participants used the longest time to don and doff PPE2 , followed by PPE1 and PPE3 . Don - ning PPE1 , PPE2 and PPE3 required an average of 6 . 61 ( range : 4 . 00 – 14 . 41 min ) , 7 . 29 ( range : 4 . 48 – 14 . 52 min ) and 3 . 28 min ( range : 1 . 34 – 7 . 36 min ) , respectively , whereas doffing required 6 . 97 ( range : 3 . 28 – 14 . 33 min ) , 10 . 37 ( range : 5 . 43 – 23 . 53 min ) and 4 . 42 min ( range : 2 . 08 – 12 . 23 ) . The HCWs working in units with relatively low infection risk showed significantly longer donning time when wearing PPE2 and PPE3 than those working in units with high infection risk . However , no significant differences were observed in the time used for doffing all PPEs under testing ( Table 4 ) . Discussion Self - contamination during doffing Our study demonstrated considerable self - contamination during doffing . This result raised concerns on pathogen contamination of the skin or clothes of HCWs during PPE removal , which may result in self - inoculation and spread of the virus to patients and other HCWs through contam - inated body fluids , including blood , urine , vomitus and stool . Gastrointestinal fluid losses of patients with EVD can be massive ( 5 – 10 L / day ) , droplet dispersion can be greater than 10 ft . and serum viral loads of dying patients with EVD can reach 10 billion copies / mL [ 15 ] . Given that no licensed vaccines nor proven effective antiviral therap - ies for EVD are currently available , PPE plays a cru - cial role in mitigating the risk of HCW exposure to contaminated body fluids in the care of patients with EVD [ 16 ] . The frequent occurrence of self - contamination during PPE doffing is also consistent with the findings of previ - ous studies [ 6 – 8 , 13 – 21 ] . The most likely contaminated areas include the neck , hands and fingers , arms and wrists and face [ 14 , 17 ] . A study conducted in South Korea that estimated the degree of contamination during PPE doffing of HCWs reported that the most vulnerable processes comprise the removal of the respirator , shoe cover and hood [ 3 ] . The current study indicated that contamination of the working clothes occurred less frequently during PPE1 removal than during the removal of PPE2 and PPE3 , which may be due to the ergonomic features of individ - ual PPEs under testing . PPE1 consists of a neck - to - ankle outfit and includes a hood covering the neck . PPE2 is a head - to - ankle overall , and is a PPE ensemble frequently used in overseas settings to prevent Ebola transmission [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] . However , PPE removal is complicated because Suen et al . Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control ( 2018 ) 7 : 157 Page 4 of 9 of the head - to - ankle , one - piece design and the elastication in the facial opening , wrists and ankles . HCWs have to take off the hood , unzip the front zipper , remove the over - all and outer gloves together and place the trousers on the chair , thereby resulting in easy contamination of the hair and head , hands , working clothes , clogs and chair [ 17 ] . The elasticated one - piece coverall hood creates a potential contamination risk because the elastic contracts and pulls the outer part of the hood inwards and towards the partic - ipants ’ hair and neck during removal [ 22 ] . The zipper and its flap are also placed along the PPE2 centre front . There - fore , a plastic apron is worn to minimise the risk of body fluids being trapped in the zipper region . Herlihey et al . [ 22 ] also reported that when the subjects unzip the cover - all , the zipper is stuck in the surrounding fabric or the gloves are stuck to the adhesive of the PPE , while unseal - ing the flaps covering the zipper results in ripping [ 22 ] . The WHO protocol requires the overall to be removed from top to bottom , followed by the removal of outer gloves whilst pulling the arms out of the sleeves of the overall . Special caution is needed to prevent self - contamination . PPE3 is recommended by HA for rou - tine patient care , in which the neck , lower part of the legs and shoes are incompletely covered . Compared with PPE 1 , additional sites , including the neck , arms , working clothes and clogs , were heavily contaminated when wear - ing PPE3 because it cannot provide adequate protection for HCWs caring for patients with EVD . These contaminated regions may be caused by self - contamination during doffing and contamination when the fluorescent solution was sprayed . Considering the possible underclothing contamination during doffing , the working clothes worn under the PPE ensembles should be frequently changed , especially when contamin - ation is suspected . During PPE1 or PPE2 doffing , the participants have to wear the clean clogs after removing their boots . However , the clogs may be possibly contaminated by the gowns or the environment in some cases . Hence , using footwear covers is an unideal option . During boot cover removal , HCWs struggle to balance their legs in the air [ 20 ] . Shoe covers are also difficult to doff , thereby often requiring as - sistance and increasing the risk of cross - contamination among workers [ 22 ] . The CDC and WHO recommend the use of double gloving with at least the outer pair possessing an extended cuff that reaches beyond the wrist [ 6 ] to decrease the incidence of hand contamination and pro - vide improved protection for HCWs during PPE removal [ 16 , 23 ] . Although double gloving is incorporated into the protocols for PPE use , the removal of the outer and inner gloves should be done with caution , followed by proper hand hygiene . Previous studies defined contamination as small fluores - cent stains ( < 1cm 2 ) and large patches ( > 1cm 2 ) [ 8 , 13 , 14 ] and revealed that fluorescent stain sizes are affected Table 2 Sites of contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment Small sized contaminated patches ( < 1 cm 2 ) , median Extra large sized contaminated patches ( ≥ 5 cm 2 ) , median Location PPE1 PPE2 PPE3 p - value PPE1 PPE2 PPE3 p - value Hair and head 1 . 00 2 . 00 2 . 50 0 . 68 0 . 00 17 . 00 0 . 00 N / A Face 1 . 00 4 . 00 2 . 00 0 . 602 0 . 00 0 . 00 8 . 00 N / A Neck ( anterior ) 2 . 50 5 . 00 11 . 00 0 . 095 0 . 00 0 . 00 24 . 00 N / A Neck ( posterior ) 2 . 00 1 . 00 18 . 50 0 . 824 0 . 00 0 . 00 0 . 00 N / A Arms ( right ) 3 . 50 1 . 00 4 . 00 0 . 414 0 . 00 0 . 00 28 . 00 N / A Arms ( left ) 2 . 00 2 . 00 1 . 00 0 . 909 0 . 00 0 . 00 49 . 00 N / A Hands or wrists 1 . 00 1 . 00 6 . 00 0 . 414 8 . 00 61 . 00 0 . 00 N / A Working clothes ( upper ) 8 . 50 9 . 00 7 . 00 0 . 997 21 . 00 48 . 50 42 . 00 0 . 690 Working clothes ( lower ) 2 . 00 2 . 50 6 . 00 0 . 111 12 . 00 46 . 00 17 . 50 0 . 276 Clogs 3 . 00 5 . 00 13 . 50 < 0 . 001 * 121 . 00 55 . 00 133 . 00 0 . 397 Environment ( rubbish bin cover ) 2 . 00 7 . 00 2 . 50 0 . 254 20 . 00 14 . 00 23 . 00 0 . 737 Environment ( chair ) 3 . 00 6 . 50 2 . 00 0 . 053 0 . 00 36 . 00 0 . 00 N / A Faucet 2 . 00 2 . 00 1 . 50 0 . 659 0 . 00 16 . 00 14 . 00 N / A Sink 12 . 50 14 . 00 10 . 00 0 . 072 75 . 50 66 . 50 44 . 00 0 . 649 Overall 5 . 00 7 . 00 7 . 00 0 . 05 * 39 . 00 43 . 00 47 . 00 < 0 . 001 * * significant p values N / A : There are fewer than two groups for the dependent variables , so no inferential statistics are computed using ANOVA PPE1 : Hospital Authority Standard Ebola PPE set PPE2 : DuPont ™ Tyvek® , Model 1422A PPE3 : Hospital Authority isolation gown for routine patient care and performing aerosol - generating procedures Suen et al . Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control ( 2018 ) 7 : 157 Page 5 of 9 during gown removal [ 8 ] . In the present study , a precise estimation of the contaminated regions was performed in terms of the size of patches , that is , small ( ≤ 1cm 2 ) , medium ( 1cm 2 to < 3cm 2 ) , large ( ≥ 1cm 2 to 5cm 2 ) , or extra large ( ≥ 5cm 2 ) . The stain sizes can be associated with either inadequate PPE coverage or because of self - contamination during PPE removal . For example , PPE3 cannot fully cover the neck of the participants , which resulted in many small or extra - large patches in the anterior and posterior neck region after spraying of the fluorescent solution onto the face shield and anterior sur - faces of the gown . Meanwhile , PPE2 offers a high coverage area during fluorescent solution spraying . However , the hair / head , hands or wrists of the participants were heavily Table 3 The deviation rate ( % ) during donning and doffing of personal protective equipment Steps Donning of PPE1 Donning of PPE2 Donning of PPE3 Procedure Error ( % ) Procedure Error ( % ) Procedure Error ( % ) 1 .

Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control ( 2018 ) 7 : 157 Page 6 of 9 contaminated with extra - large patches during PPE re - moval . Similarly , medium - sized patch contamination can be due to either the PPE design or self - contamination . Therefore , a PPE with a high coverage area and simple ergonomic features that can minimise the risk of recon - tamination during doffing should be designed . In this study , the older staff showed significantly less small - sized contaminated patches on their working clothes than the younger staff . This result may be due to the additional cautiousness of the older staff , whilst working than the younger staff . However , this finding cannot be generalised because of the low number of older staff ( n = 4 ) who participated in this study . Environmental contamination In addition to self - contamination of HCWs during PPE doffing , environmental contaminations , such as those in the lid of the rubbish bin , chair , faucet and sink , were observed . Human - to - human transmission of EVD is also possible via indirect contact with the environment con - taminated with such fluids [ 24 ] . The virus can survive for several hours on dry surfaces , such as doorknobs and countertops , to several days at room temperature in body fluids , such as blood [ 25 ] ; virus - positive samples were still observed 7 days post - mortem [ 16 ] . Considering that hand hygiene methods using alcohol hand sanitiser fail to remove the fluorescent solution , handwashing with soap and water was performed by the participants . Thus , the sink may be contaminated because of handwashing , and the working clothes that came in contact with the sink may be contaminated because of the repeated handwashing . These results suggested that the height and width of the sink must be at a good working level of HCWs to prevent self - contamination during handwashing . Although alcohol gel is commonly used nowadays during PPE donning / doffing , hand cleansing with soap and water is recommended in cases of visible contamination in various situations , such as when areas are contaminated by vomitus , respiratory secretions , or fecal matter . Discarding used PPEs should be given much attention because of frequent contamination of rubbish bin covers [ 13 ] . Protocol deviations and importance of training Deviations of the donning procedure may increase the risk of self - contamination whilst doffing [ 20 ] . Although the participants watched a video on PPE donning and doffing to familiarise themselves with the steps on the day of testing , they can also refer to the posters related to the procedures available in the venue . PPE1 exhibited the lowest overall deviation rate among the three PPE ensembles during doffing ( 2 . 95 , 9 . 48 and 3 . 52 % for PPE1 , PPE2 and PPE3 , respectively ) . This finding was expected because of the complexity of PPE2 , as de - scribed above . The highest deviation rate ( 58 . 33 % ) was observed during the simultaneous removal of the overall and outer gloves in PPE2 . As mentioned above , this re - sult agrees with the WHO protocol for doffing overall [ 12 ] . This protocol requires the participants to remove the inner gloves , which were covered by the coverall . This procedure is difficult for many participants because they can only ‘ feel ’ the inner gloves during removal and cannot see them . Therefore , several participants cannot remove the overall and outer gloves together , or in cer - tain situations , they removed both the inner and outer gloves simultaneously . Apart from the emphasis on regular training for HCWs to perform the procedure smoothly , the doffing procedure should be evaluated to increase its practicability for the users . Being an international aviation hub , Hong Kong is fre - quently visited by travellers from all around the world . Moreover , contacts between Mainland China and African Table 4 Time ( in minutes ) required for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment All participants Mean ( sd ) n = 59 High - risk group Mean ( sd ) n = 28 Low - risk group Mean ( sd ) n = 31 p - value # ( t - test , high risk vs low risk ) Time required for donning ( min ) PPE1 6 . 59 ( 1 . 67 ) 6 . 19 ( 1 . 13 ) 6 . 94 ( 1 . 99 ) 0 . 086 PPE2 7 . 26 ( 2 . 06 ) 6 . 63 ( 1 . 77 ) 7 . 83 ( 2 . 16 ) < 0 . 05 * PPE3 3 . 28 ( 1 . 15 ) 2 . 90 ( 0 . 98 ) 3 . 63 ( 1 . 25 ) < 0 . 05 * P < 0 . 001 * Time required for doffing ( min ) PPE1 6 . 95 ( 2 . 59 ) 6 . 79 ( 2 . 42 ) 7 . 10 ( 2 . 77 ) 0 . 659 PPE2 10 . 31 ( 3 . 93 ) 10 . 24 ( 3 . 85 ) 10 . 38 ( 4 . 07 ) 0 . 893 PPE3 4 . 44 ( 1 . 87 ) 4 . 30 ( 1 . 38 ) 4 . 56 ( 2 . 23 ) 0 . 594 P < 0 . 001 * # t - test , participants working in units with higher infection risk versus working with lower infection risk * significant p values PPE1 : Hospital Authority Standard Ebola PPE set PPE2 : DuPont ™ Tyvek® , Model 1422A PPE3 : Hospital Authority isolation gown for routine patient care and performing aerosol - generating procedures Suen et al . Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control ( 2018 ) 7 : 157 Page 7 of 9 countries are becoming increasingly frequent . Although most HCWs in Hong Kong possess inadequate experience in handling EVD cases , providing regular training for HCWs is necessary to fill the gap between the desired PPE performance and actual practice . Contamination errors caused by unfamiliarity with the procedures , complexity with PPE ensembles and unconscious habits can be pre - vented through repeated practice and training . Evidence shows that traditional learning methods ( e . g . , watching educational videos and learning PPE guidelines ) are infer - ior to immersive learning methods , including audio - visual devices and active learning involvement using simulation training that includes feedback on performance for clinical management of EVD cases , in guiding the PPE procedures [ 3 , 17 , 26 , 27 ] . On the average , participants used the longest time for donning and doffing PPE2 , followed by PPE1 and PPE3 . A study reported that HCWs may show poor compli - ance with proper PPE removal protocol because of time constraints [ 28 ] . The most time - consuming processes in - clude removing the shoe covers , putting on gloves and removing the outer gloves [ 3 ] . Thus , a short duration of doffing PPE is important for the faultless completion of removal protocol . Familiarisation of the HCWs with the procedures via frequent training and improved ergo - nomic features is necessary for the PPE design not only to prevent HCWs from self - contamination but also to shorten PPE donning and doffing time . Limitations of study This study has several limitations . Results showed the pos - sibility of Hawthorne effect because the participants knew that they were being observed during the study . Therefore , compared with previous findings , real - life contamination rates or protocol deviations can be poorer than the findings presented in this study . Result generalisation is limited given the small number of participants , most of which are relatively young staff . A larger sample size with a better bal - ance of staff seniority than that of the present study should be considered in future trials to evaluate whether clinical experiences influence the PPE performance . The fluorescent solution used in this study was intended to mimic the mechanical effects of body fluids or secre - tions of patients with EVD . Although this method can provide a visualisation of contamination , it cannot provide information about viral load and shows no response to alcohol - based hand sanitiser , similar to EVD . Future stud - ies may consider using surrogate viruses , such as MS2 ( a surrogate for non - enveloped human viruses ) and bacterio - phage ϕ 6 ( a surrogate for enveloped viruses such as Ebola ) to allow researchers to obtain quantitative data on virus transfer events and risks to HCWs without exposing par - ticipants to the risk of infection [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . Conclusion Our study demonstrated considerable self - contamination during PPE doffing of HCWs . Use of the head - to - ankle one - piece overall ( PPE2 ) may result in a higher contamin - ation risk than that of the neck - to - ankle outfit with a hood covering the neck ( PPE1 ) . Environmental contaminations , such as those in rubbish bin cover , chair , faucet and sink were detected . Procedure deviations during donning and doffing of the PPEs were observed , with PPE1 exhibiting the lowest overall deviation rate ( % ) among the three PPE ensembles during doffing . Although PPE1 showed the best performance in terms of low risk of self - contamination compared with PPE2 and PPE3 during doffing and protocol deviations , the design of PPE1 can be still further improved . Future directions should focus on designing a PPE with a high coverage area and simple ergonomic features . Evaluat - ing the doffing procedure is also necessary to minimise the risk of recontamination during doffing . Regular training for users should be emphasised to minimise protocol devia - tions and in turn guarantee the best protection of HCWs . Additional files Additional file 1 : Figure S1 .
