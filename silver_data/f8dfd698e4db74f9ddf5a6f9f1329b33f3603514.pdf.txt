202 Research Paper Human p21 - activated kinase ( Pak1 ) regulates actin organization in mammalian cells Mary Ann Sells * , Ulla G . Knaus † , Shubha Bagrodia ‡ , Diane M . Ambrose * , Gary M . Bokoch † and Jonathan Chernoff * Background : The Rho family GTPases Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA regulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton induced by extracellular signals such as growth factors . In mammalian cells , Cdc42 regulates the formation of filopodia , whereas Rac regulates lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling , and RhoA regulates the formation of stress fibers . Recently , the serine / threonine protein kinase p65 pak was isolated by virtue of its ability to bind to activated Cdc42 and Rac1 . Upon binding , p65 pak autophosphorylates , thereby increasing its catalytic activity towards exogenous substrates . This kinase is therefore a candidate effector for the changes in cell shape induced by growth factors . Results : Here , we report that the microinjection of activated Pak1 protein into quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells induces the rapid formation of polarized filopodia and membrane ruffles . The prolonged overexpression of Pak1 amino - terminal mutants that are unable to bind Cdc42 or Rac1 results in the accumulation of filamentous actin in large , polarized membrane ruffles and the formation of vinculin - containing focal complexes within these structures . This phenotype resembles that seen in motile fibroblasts . The amino - terminal Pak1 mutant displays enhanced binding to the adaptor protein Nck , which contains three Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains . Mutation of a proline residue within a conserved SH3 - binding region at the amino terminus of Pak1 interferes with SH3 - protein binding and alters the effects of Pak1 on the cytoskeleton . Conclusions : These results indicate that Pak1 , acting through a protein that contains an SH3 domain , regulates the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian cells , and may serve as an effector for Cdc42 and / or Rac1 in promoting cell motility . Background Many growth factors , in addition to stimulating cell division , also cause rapid changes in cell shape . The Rho family of small GTPases , which includes Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA , seems to be essential in directing actin - reor - ganization pathways that result in these changes in cell morphology , characterized by the formation of filopodia , lamellipodia , membrane ruffles and stress fibers [ 1 – 4 ] . Similar proteins are required for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in budding and fission yeast [ 5 , 6 ] . The molecular details of how these Rho family GTPases are regulated are not well understood , although several candidate regulatory proteins have been identi - fied [ 7 , 8 ] . Even less is known about the mechanism by which the activated GTPases transmit signals to the actin cytoskeleton . Recently , two protein kinases were isolated by virtue of their ability to bind to activated Rac1 . Both human p120 ack [ 9 ] and rat p65 pak [ 10 ] bind preferentially to activated ( GTP - bound ) Rac1 and Cdc42 , inhibit subsequent GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) activity on these proteins , and , at least in the case of p65 pak , autophosphorylate upon binding — thereby increasing their catalytic activity towards exogenous sub - strates [ 10 ] . These kinases are therefore candidate effec - tor proteins that cause cell shape changes in response to growth factors . Results In order to test whether p65 pak or related proteins are part of the signaling apparatus for cell morphogenesis , we examined the effects of a human p65 pak protein on actin reorganization . We used the polymerase chain reaction to identify Pak - like gene fragments from a human lympho - cyte cDNA library , and subsequently cloned the full - length cDNAs from the same library . One of the clones encoded a 544 amino - acid protein , Pak1 , which has 98 % identity to rat p65 pak and which is expressed primarily in brain , skeletal muscle and spleen . A second clone encoded a ubiquitously expressed , 525 amino - acid protein , termed Pak2 , with 78 % identity to rat p65 pak ( data not shown ) . Pak1 has been well - characterized biochemically [ 10 , 11 ] , and so we chose to examine in detail the function of this Addresses : * Fox Chase Cancer Centre , 7701 Burholme Avenue , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 1911 , USA . † Departments of Immunology and Cell Biology , Research Institute of Scripps Clinic , La Jolla , California 92037 , USA . ‡ Department of Pharmacology , Cornell University , Ithaca , New York 14853 , USA .

We first expressed Pak1 in Swiss 3T3 cells , and assessed the effects on cell morphology . Quiescent cells were microinjected with a fusion protein of Pak1 and glutathione - S - transferase ( GST – Pak - 1 ) , and studied by time - lapse microscopy . GST – Pak1 is constitutively active in vitro [ 11 ] , possibly because of conformational changes induced at the amino terminus of Pak1 by fusion with GST ( see below ) . Cells injected with GST – Pak1 rapidly developed filopodia and lamellipodia at a leading edge and retraction fibers at a trailing edge , suggesting that GST – Pak1 stimulates cell movement ( Fig . 1 ) . These effects were observed in more than 80 % of injected cells . The simultaneous development of filopodia and retraction fibers has also been reported in Cdc42 - injected cells [ 3 ] . The injection of GST or buffer alone had no discernible effect on cell morphology . These effects were not inhib - ited by co - injection of GST – Pak1 with dominant - negative ( N17 ) forms of Cdc42 or Rac1 ( data not shown ) , consistent with the idea that Pak1 functions downstream of these GTPases in an actin - reorganization signaling pathway . This notion is supported by the observation that endoge - nous Pak1 colocalizes with filamentous ( F ) actin to filopo - dia , lamellipodia and membrane ruffles in Swiss 3T3 cells treated with platelet - derived growth factor ( S . Dharmawardhane , R . H . Daniels and G . M . B . , unpublished observations ) ; increased physical association of Pak1 with F - actin is also observed under these conditions . As GST – Pak1 is susceptible to proteolytic degradation during production and storage [ 11 ] , we asked whether the sustained expression of Pak1 from a plasmid vector induced similar effects on cell morphology , and which fea - tures of the protein were required for these events . We made Pak1 with point mutations that abolish binding to Cdc42 and Rac1 and / or alter kinase activity ( Fig . 2 ) . Pak1 L83 , L86 , with leucine residues were substituted for two highly conserved histidine residues within the p21 - binding domain ( PBD ) , was unable to bind to Cdc42 or Rac1 and had enhanced kinase activity towards itself ( Fig . 2 ) and exogenous substrates ( data not shown ) . A catalytically inactive form of this PBD mutant ( Pak1 L83 , L86 , R299 ) was constructed by replacing an essential lysine in the protein kinase subdomain II with arginine . A second activated form of Pak1 ( Pak1 E423 ) was generated by replacing a threonine Figure 1 GST – Pak1 induces the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia in Swiss 3T3 cells .

Anti - Myc immunoprecipitates were assayed for the presence of Pak1 by immunoblot , for binding to Rac1 and Cdc42 by an overlay assay , and for autokinase activity .

Similar activating mutations have been made in other serine / threonine kinases [ 12 ] , and imply that this residue may serve as a regulatory phosphorylation site . The ability of Pak1 E423 to bind to Cdc42 and Rac1 was unimpaired . We compared the morphological effects of expressing Rho family GTPases or Pak1 in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells . In agreement with previous reports [ 1 – 4 ] , cells expressing constitutively active mutants of Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA pre - dominantly formed filopodia , circumferential lamellipodia and increased stress fibers , respectively ( Fig . 3f – h ) . Expres - sion of wild - type Pak1 ( tagged with a Myc epitope ) had little effect on actin distribution ( Fig . 3b ) , whereas expres - sion of Myc - tagged Pak1 L83 , L86 induced a distinct pheno - type , characterized by increased stress fibers and large , protruding , ruffle - like structures positioned at one side of the cell ( Fig . 3c ) . This distinctive morphology , similar to that of motile fibroblasts , was observed in more than 70 % of the transfected cells , and identical results were obtained using a different cell type ( REF52 ) and a different transfec - tion method ( plasmid microinjection ) . Omission of the small , amino - terminal epitope tag gave equivalent results ( data not shown ) . Confocal imaging revealed that a substan - tial fraction of the Pak1 L83 , L86 mutant protein was concen - trated within these ruffle - like structures , where it colocalized with F - actin ( Fig . 4 ) and vinculin in focal com - plexes ( data not shown ) . The remainder of the Pak1 L83 , L86 appeared to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm , most prominently in the perinuclear region . As Pak1 L83 , L86 does not bind to Rac1 or Cdc42 , the observed effects on actin distribution are unlikely to be caused by increased p21 – GTP levels resulting from the protection of these GTPases from GAPs [ 10 ] . The subcellular distributions of wild - type Pak1 and the PBD mutant were grossly similar ( data not shown ) , and so the effects of these proteins on cytoskeletal architecture may instead be due to differences in kinase activity , or to dif - ferences in the conformation of the amino terminus , as reflected by the inability of Pak1 L83 , L86 to bind p21 GTPases ( Fig . 2 ) . In order to distinguish between these possibilities , we tested the effects of expressing the acti - vated Pak1 E423 mutant , which can bind p21 . Cells express - ing Pak1 E423 were flattened and occasionally showed filopodia ( 1 – 2 per cell ) and complete loss of stress fibers ( Fig . 3d ) , but were otherwise similar to untransfected qui - escent cells ( Fig . 3a ) . In contrast , the kinase - dead Pak1 L83 , L86 , R299 mutant , which cannot bind p21 , induced the formation of unipolar ruffles ( Fig . 3e ) , similar to those observed in cells expressing Pak1 L83 , L86 ( Fig . 3c ) , although the cells expressing Pak1 L83 , L86 , R299 were more elongated and crescent - shaped . In Swiss 3T3 cells , therefore , Pak1 - mediated actin reorgani - zation appears to have two components : a generalized effect on cell shape that is dependent on the protein kinase activ - ity of Pak1 ; and an effect on F - actin accumulation in local - ized , ruffle - like structures which requires conformational changes at the amino terminus of Pak1 , but which is largely 204 Current Biology , Vol 7 No 3 Figure 3 Effect of Pak1 on filamentous actin distribution .

Scale bar equals 10 (cid:109) m . Research Paper Pak1 regulates actin organization Sells et al . 205 independent of its protein kinase activity . For wild - type Pak1 , such conformational changes presumably occur in vivo upon binding to activated Cdc42 or Rac1 . Microin - jected GST – Pak1 protein , which has no mutation in the PBD , does induce actin remodeling ( Fig . 1 ) ; this effect may be related to unfolding of the amino terminus result - ing from fusion to the bulky GST moiety , a possibility supported by the finding that GST – Pak1 is constitutively active in vitro [ 11 ] . Which non - kinase domain on Pak1 might be affected by binding to Rac1 or Cdc42 ? Amino - terminal to the PBD , all known mammalian Paks , as well as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans Pak1 , have a highly conserved , proline - rich motif which directs interactions with proteins that contain a Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain , such as Nck [ 13 – 15 ] . We compared the ability of wild - type Pak1 and the Pak1 L83 , L86 PBD mutant to bind to Nck in vitro . Lysates from cells expressing wild - type and mutant Pak1 were overlayed on nitrocellulose filters containing defined amounts of GST – Nck , and then analyzed for bound Pak1 by western immunoblotting . Pak1 L83 , L86 bound much more avidly than wild - type Pak1 to GST – Nck , as judged by the intensity of the signal on the immunoblots ( Fig . 5a ) . No binding of Pak1 was detected when GST alone was spotted on the filter in place of GST – Nck . When the lysates were preincubated with activated recombinant Rac1 , the binding of wild - type Pak1 to GST – Nck increased about four - fold , whereas the binding of Pak1 L83 , L86 was unaffected ( data not shown ) . Similar results were obtained in vivo ( Fig . 5b ) . Endogenous Nck was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with either wild - type Pak1 or Pak1 L83 , L86 ( both were tagged with a hemagglutinin ( HA ) - epitope ) , and the immunoprecipi - tates were examined by anti - HA immunoblotting . Although the wild - type and mutant Pak1 were expressed at approximately equal levels , approximately four - fold more of the mutant Pak1 co - immunoprecipitated with Nck . These data suggest that the proline - rich domain at the amino terminus of Pak1 becomes more accessible to SH3 proteins following the activation of Pak1 by Rac1 , and that this phenomenon can be elicited in the absence of Rac1 by mutations within the nearby PBD . In order to determine whether the amino - terminal , proline - rich region of Pak1 mediates any of its effects on the cytoskeleton , we compared actin organization and focal complex formation in cells transfected with the PBD mutant Pak1 L83 , L86 or with Pak1 A13 , L83 , L86 ; this latter form of Pak1 has an additional mutation within the amino - terminal , proline - rich region that completely abol - ishes binding to Nck [ 14 , 15 ] and to several other proteins that contain SH3 domains ( J . C . , unpublished observa - tions ) . When expressed in Swiss 3T3 cells , Pak1 A13 , L83 , L86 caused an increase in stress fibers , but failed to induce polarized membrane ruffles in the major - ity of cells ( Fig . 6k ) . These data indicate that the forma - tion of polarized membrane ruffles requires the amino - terminal , proline - rich region of Pak1 . As the sub - cellular distribution of both Pak1 mutants was similar ( data not shown ) , the lack of membrane ruffling in cells expressing Pak1 A13 , L83 , L86 does not appear to be due to a gross mislocalization of this protein . It is possible , however , that a subtle mislocalization of Pak1 would be missed in these analyses , as the high level of expression used might obscure such differences . The expression of either Pak1 L83 , L86 or Pak1 A13 , L83 , L86 induced the formation of vinculin - containing focal com - plexes , but these complexes were much more prominent in cells expressing Pak1 L83 , L86 , and were concentrated within the ruffles of such cells ( Fig . 6j , l ) . The vinculin - containing focal complexes in cells expressing Pak1 L83 , L86 were comparable in size and shape to those seen in cells expressing Cdc42 or Rac1 ( Fig . 6b , d ) , but were distinct from the larger , arrow - head shaped adhe - sion complexes induced by RhoA ( Fig . 6f ) . Interestingly , the increase in stress fibers could be blocked by co - expression of dominant - negative ( N19 ) RhoA ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that the increase in stress fibers seen with these Pak1 mutants is mediated by the activation of endogenous Rho . Discussion The results reported here indicate that Pak1 modulates the structure of the actin cytoskeleton and may serve as a morphogenic effector for Cdc42 and / or Rac1 in vivo . This Figure 4 Co - localization of Pak1 and F - actin . Swiss 3T3 cells were transfected with pCMV6 encoding Myc – Pak1 L83 , L86 and processed as described in the legend to Figure 3 . The distribution of ( a ) F - actin and ( b ) Myc epitope was examined by indirect immunofluorescence , using confocal microscopy . A combined image , shown in color ( c ) , indicates areas of colocalization in yellow . Scale bar equals 10 (cid:109) m . conclusion is based on the ability of Pak1 mutants , when introduced into cells , to stimulate the formation of polarized lamellipodia , membrane ruffles and filopodia . These effects are independent of the action of Rac1 and / or Cdc42 , as dominant - negative ( N17 ) forms of these GTPases were unable to block Pak1 - induced cytoskeletal responses . Also , like Rac and Cdc42 , Pak1 induces the formation of vin - culin - containing focal complexes . Although we and others have shown that mammalian Paks mediate activation of stress - activated protein kinase cas - cades by Rac1 / Cdc42 [ 16 – 19 ] , probably via a MEKK , the relevance of this activation to cytoskeletal rearrangements or cell motility is not clear . In this study , we have shown that the ability of Pak1 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton is in part independent of its intrinsic serine / threonine kinase activity . Pak1 constructs with a modified amino terminus have dramatic effects on the polarity of the cytoskeleton in Swiss 3T3 cells , whether or not they have an active catalytic domain . Conversely , Pak1 that is not modified at the amino terminus , but that has high levels of constitutive kinase activity , lacks these effects . The ability of Pak1 to regulate polarized actin assembly appears to depend on an amino - terminal , proline - rich domain in Pak1 which has a predicted SH3 - binding motif , PXXP ( single - letter amino - acid code , X indicating any amino acid ) ; mutation of this SH3 - binding domain inhibits the ability of Pak1 to induce the formation of polarized membrane ruffles and focal complexes . The importance of the amino - terminal PXXP domain for cytoskeletal regulation by Pak1 is shown by the enhanced binding of the highly active Pak1 L83 , L86 mutant and Cdc42 - activated , wild - type Pak1 to the SH3 - containing Nck . Fur - thermore , it has been established that this domain serves as a functional SH3 - binding site in vivo , interacting with the second SH3 domain of the Nck adaptor protein [ 14 , 15 ] . Our data suggest that Pak1 binds a protein which contains an SH3 domain and which regulates its localization and / or affects actin dynamics . Interestingly , an analogous situation has been described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 20 ] . In this species , a protein known as Bem1p binds to the yeast Pak homolog , Ste20p , through an SH3 domain present on Bem1p ( [ 20 ] and E . Leberer , personal communication ) . This interaction with Bem1p mediates a physical associa - tion of Ste20p with F - actin and contributes to the regula - tion of cell morphology in yeast . Although no mammalian Bem1p homologs are known , a fission yeast homolog , Scd2p / Ral3p [ 21 ] , binds to fission yeast Pak1p ( J . C . , 206 Current Biology , Vol 7 No 3 Figure 5 Effect of Pak1 PBD mutations on binding to Nck . ( a ) The indicated amounts ( in (cid:109) g ) of GST – Nck SH3 domain 2 were spotted onto nitrocellulose .

To the left , an anti - Myc immunoblot is shown of the Pak1 - containing lysates used for the overlay .

Therefore , it is plausible that mammalian Paks are linked to the cytoskeleton via a Bem1p - like protein . This physical association with actin - binding proteins might give Pak access to key substrates , perhaps within focal adhesions . Alternatively , as suggested by the cytoskeletal activity of the kinase - dead Pak - 1 protein ( Fig . 3e ) , this enzyme might serve as a scaffold to assemble additional molecules that affect actin structure . From these other observations and our current data , we hypothesize that the binding of activated Rac1 – GTP or Cdc42 – GTP to Pak1 changes the conformation of its amino terminus such that the SH3 - binding domain is exposed and / or has higher affinity for SH3 - containing target proteins . These putative target proteins , perhaps serving as the func - tional equivalent of Bem1p in budding yeast , would enable Pak1 to associate with and / or regulate F - actin . In this model , Pak1 acts as a bifunctional regulatory molecule , with the amino - terminal PXXP motifs primarily regulating polarization of the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with SH3 - containing proteins , and the catalytic carboxyl ter - minus primarily mediating activation of the stress - activated protein kinase cascades by Rac1 / Cdc42 ( Fig . 7 ) . However , as the phenotypes elicited by expression of kinase - active and kinase - dead Pak1 L83 , L86 are not completely equivalent ( compare Fig . 3c , e ) , the kinase activity of this protein may also influence some aspect of F - actin assembly , perhaps indirectly via the phosphorylation of myosin . The established morphogenic roles of Pak homologs in budding and fission yeast [ 20 , 22 – 26 ] , as well as the effects of Pak expression in mammalian cells ( [ 27 ] and this study ) , suggest that Paks regulate cytoskeletal structure . Are Paks , then , cytoskeletal effectors for Cdc42 and / or Figure 6 Focal complex formation in cells expressing wild - type or mutant forms of Pak1 .

Scale bar equals 10 (cid:109) m . Rac ? Expression of Pak1 in Swiss 3T3 cells induces a phe - notype that differs from that elicited by Rac1 and Cdc42 . Pak1 - induced filipodia and lamellipodia are polarized to the leading edge of the cell , rather than symmetrically dis - tributed , as is the case for Cdc42 and Rac1 . The resulting appearance of such cells is similar to that seen in motile fibroblasts . In addition , recent mutational analyses of Cdc42 and Rac1 have cast doubt on the roles of Pak or other PBD - containing proteins in mediating the cytoskeletal effects of these GTPases . Mouse fibroblasts expressing Rac1 or Cdc42 mutants that cannot activate Pak nevertheless form filopodia and circumferential mem - brane ruffling , respectively [ 28 , 29 ] . Furthermore , a second set of Rac1 or Cdc42 mutants that are expected to retain the ability to activate Pak fail to induce formation of these structures . However , neither of these experiments pre - clude the possibility that Paks regulate the organization of cortical actin and influence focal complex assembly . For example , while Rac1 A37 , L61 and Cdc42 A37 , L61 ( which fail to induce ruffles or filopodia , respectively ) were shown to be capable of binding Pak1 in vitro , and of activating the Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway in transfected COS cells , there is as yet no evidence that endogenous Pak1 is actually activated by these mutant GTPases in murine fibroblasts . In addition to the three known mammalian Paks , Rac1 and Cdc42 bind several other PBD - containing protein kinases , such as ‘mixed lineage’ kinases , many of which also can activate the JNK pathway [ 30 – 33 ] . Therefore , it is possible that the activation of JNK induced by Rac1 A37 , L61 or Cdc42 A37 , L61 in COS cells is mediated through a kinase other than Pak1 . Indeed , the relative levels of Paks versus mixed - lineage kinases have not been described in COS cells or in murine fibroblasts . Thus , activated Pak1 could mediate some of the cytoskeletal effects of Rac1 or Cdc42 in specific cell types . A similar argument has been proposed by Lamarche et al . [ 22 ] to account for the actin - reorganizing activity of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , which , like Pak1 , binds to Cdc42 via a conserved PBD [ 34 ] . It is also possible that , in some circumstances , Pak1 can reg - ulate the actin cytoskeleton independently of activation by GTPases — for example , by recruitment to the plasma membrane in response to Nck translocation stimulated by growth factors [ 14 , 35 ] . The phenotype of Swiss 3T3 cells expressing Pak1 L83 , L86 most closely resembles that seen during cell locomotion , and preliminary data indicate that such cells in fact display altered motility ( M . A . S . and J . C . , unpublished observa - tions ) . The mechanism for some of these effects appears to involve the interaction of Pak1 with an as yet uncharac - terized SH3 - containing actin regulatory protein , perhaps related in structure or function to budding yeast Bem1p . It is also possible that some of the effects of Pak1 on the actin cytoskeleton are mediated indirectly through myosin . In Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium , Pak homo - logues have recently been shown to phosphorylate myosin heavy chain , stimulating its Mg (cid:215) ATPase activity [ 36 , 37 ] . Myosin I contains an SH3 domain , which might provide a binding site for Pak1 [ 38 ] . Although vertebrate myosin I proteins lack an equivalent activating phosphorylation site [ 39 ] , a related isoform , myosin VI , does contain this site [ 38 ] . It is also interesting to note that certain forms of myosin II [ 40 ] and Pak1 ( S . Dharmawardhane , R . H . Daniels and G . M . B . , unpublished observations ) have been localized to the leading edge of polarized cells . Finally , a known Pak1 - binding SH3 protein , such as Nck , may be involved in the accumulation of F - actin in mammalian cells ( J . Y . Bu , R . Pappu , B . Mayer , J . C . , D . Straus , and A . C . Chan , unpublished observations ) . The Cdc42 - binding protein WASP also binds to Nck , and thus , with Pak1 , potentially forms part of a morphogenic signaling apparatus in some cell types [ 34 , 41 ] . The identification of proteins that interact with Pak1 promises to extend our understanding of the role of these enzymes in eukaryotic cell morphogenesis . Conclusions In Swiss 3T3 cells , the expression of Pak1 proteins bearing mutations at the amino terminus induces the polarized redistribution of F - actin and the formation of focal complexes — a phenotype similar to that seen in motile fibroblasts . Many of these effects appear to be mediated by an SH3 - binding motif located at the amino terminus of Pak1 . We propose that these mutant forms of 208 Current Biology , Vol 7 No 3 Figure 7 A model for Pak1 activity . Upon binding to Cdc42 or Rac1 , a conformational change in Pak1 may unmask its amino - terminal proline - rich domain as well as cause increased kinase activity . The exposed proline - rich domain may then engage in productive interactions with SH3 - containing proteins which dictate localization and / or mediate some of the cytoskeletal effects of Pak1 . The kinase domain of Pak1 may also affect cytoskeletal structure through phosphorylation of targets such as myosin , as well as mediate the activation of stress - activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) cascades , probably via a MEKK .

Materials and methods Cell Culture COS1 and Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % FBS . COS1 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine and Swiss 3T3 cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate method [ 42 ] . Protein preparation and microinjections Human Pak1 and Pak2 were cloned by standard methods from a human lymphoblastoid cDNA library [ 43 ] ( GenBank accession numbers : Pak1 , U24152 ; Pak2 , U24153 ) . Bacterial expression vectors were created by subcloning cDNAs into pGEX - 2T [ 44 ] , and GST fusion proteins were purified by standard techniques , and dialyzed against phosphate - buffered saline . Cells were injected with 100 (cid:109) g ml – 1 GST – Pak1 , with or without 500 (cid:109) g ml – 1 N17 - Rac1 , N17 - Cdc42 , or N19 - RhoA , and 500 (cid:109) g ml – 1 rat immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) . For time - lapse experiments , the cells were photographed at the indi - cated intervals . In co - injection experiments , the cells were fixed 15 min post - injection , and stained for the presence of IgG and for F - actin . Eukaryotic expression vectors cDNAs encoding Pak1 and p21 GTPases were subcloned into the epitope tag expression vectors pJ3M and pJ3H , respectively [ 45 ] , then subcloned as Sal I – Eco RI fragments into pCMV6 ( a modified version of pCMV5 ) [ 46 ] . For some experiments , HA - tagged Pak1 was also used . Immunofluorescence Cells were fixed in 3 . 5 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , and blocked with 3 % BSA . In Figure 1 , cells were stained for the presence of IgG ( Lissamine - Rhodamine B - conjugated goat anti - rat IgG ) and for filamentous actin ( 0 . 1 (cid:109) M FITC - phalloidin ) for 45 min . In Figure 3 , cells were stained with mouse anti - epitope tag antibodies , followed by Lissamine - Rhodamine - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibodies and FITC - conjugated phalloidin . In Figure 6 , cells were stained with with rabbit anti - epitope tag and mouse anti - vinculin antibodies , followed by Lissamine Rhodamine - conjugated anti - rabbit antibodies ( to localize cells expressing recombinant protein ) , 0 . 1 (cid:109) M FITC - conjugated phalloidin , and AMCA - conjugated anti - mouse antibodies ( to localize vinculin ) . Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio - Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal micro - scope . Binding studies COS1 cells ( maintained in DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ) were transfected with control or protein - encoding plasmid DNA . 48 h post - transfection , the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 137 mM NaCl , 1 % NP40 , 10 % glycerol , 10 mM (cid:98) - glycerol phosphate , 1 mM Naávanadate , 1 mM PMSF , 10 (cid:109) g ml – 1 aprotinin . A portion of the lysate was boiled in an equal volume of 2× SDS / PAGE sample buffer , and the remainder was used either for in vitro binding studies , by incubation with GST – p21 beads for 2 h at 4°C , or immuno - precipitated with either anti - HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 ( BabCO ) or anti - Nck polyclonal sera ( a gift from Ed Skolnik ) . Lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblot following SDS / 10 % PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidine flouride ( Immo - bilon ) membranes . Signals were detected using enhanced chemilumi - nescence ( Pierce ) . Rac1 and Cdc42 overlay assays ( Fig . 2 ) were performed essentially as described in [ 47 ] using 2 (cid:109) g ml – 1 (cid:103) - [ 35 S ] GTP - loaded Cdc42 or Rac1 for 20 min at 4°C , then 10 min at room temperature . After washing to remove non - specific binding , the blots were exposed to Kodak XAR film at – 70°C for 24 h . Pak1 overlay binding assays ( Fig . 5a ) were carried out by spotting the indicated amount of GST – Nck - SH3 domain 2 ( amino acids 101 – 166 ) onto a nitrocellulose membrane , blocking with 5 % non - fat milk , then incubating the membrane at 4°C for 30 min with lysates from COS1 cells transfected with Myc - tagged Pak1 or Pak1 L83 , L86 . The membrane was then washed extensively and immunoblotted with anti - Myc anti - bodies . Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence . Kinase assays Kinase activity was assessed by incubating anti - Myc immunoprecipi - tates in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 (cid:109) M (cid:103) - [ 32 P ] ATP ( 5 000 cpm pmol – 1 ) for 20 min at 30°C . The reac - tion was terminated with SDS / PAGE sample buffer , separated by 10 % SDS / PAGE , blotted to a PVDF membrane and autoradiographed at – 70°C for 16 h .
