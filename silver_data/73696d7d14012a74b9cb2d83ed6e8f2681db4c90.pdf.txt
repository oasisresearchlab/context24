Thus , how cells sense and respond to the external topography is not well understood . A bottleneck to address this question demands to conciliate the time - consuming and limited access to top - down nanofabrication techniques with cell biology and advance microscopy approaches . Here , we have engineered 1D SiO 2 nanopillar arrays of defined sizes and shapes on high - performance coverslips by soft - gel nanoimprint lithography ( soft - NIL ) 4 , which is a cost - effective , customizable , large - scale fabrication and benchtop equipment - based method . By this novel fabrication of nanostructured substrates , we were able to perform super - resolution microscopy and to demonstrate that large membrane morphologies favor the formation of stable clathrin / AP - 2 structures , a process that is assisted by the formation of functional actin networks . The key interface mediating the first interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix is the plasma membrane . The ability of the plasma membrane to reshape in response to external mechanical stimuli and to trigger biochemical signals through the recruitment and / or disassembly of membrane - associated proteins is a fundamental feature to preserve cellular hemostasis 3 . Thus , the plasma membrane is no longer considered as a passive barrier but as a mechanosensing structure connecting the cell with its environment . A powerful approach to investigate the response of living cells to topography changes of the external milieu consist on the engineering of vertical nanostructures such as nanopillars 1 , nanoneedles 5 or nanocones 2 , among others , primary obtained by top - down procedures , such as focused ion beam ( FIB ) . By using these devices , it was shown that topography - induced curvature is able to modulate cellular processes such as membrane trafficking 1 , cytoskeleton organization 6 and nuclear mechanotransduction 6 . Indeed , the recruitment of curvature - sensing proteins implicated in the formation of “canonical” clathrin - coated structures was shown to be enhanced by seeding living cells on nanostructures with a curvature diameter below 400 nm 1 , 2 .

Indeed , the actin cytoskeleton is implicated in the force - generation and remodeling of membranes during cell morphological changes , as a result of the attachment of the actin cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane at the cell cortex and the regulation of the cortical tension 9 . To investigate how actin organization and the localization of endocytic proteins is affected by the shape of large membrane structures , we engineered arrays of 1D SiO 2 nanopillars of defined dimensions ( D ) and shape : D ~ 400 nm ( circular shape ) , D ~ 600 nm ( circular shape ) , D ~ 850 nm ( square shape ) , as determined from scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) ( see Supplementary Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Briefly , we customized soft Nano - Imprint Lithography ( NIL ) of epitaxial a - quartz ( SiO 2 ) thin films 10 , 11 by combining top - down and bottom - up ( sol - gel ) approaches to fabricate nanostructured SiO 2 layers of controlled shape , diameter and periodicity on high - performance coverslips made of borosilicate glass , which are the substrate of choice for super - resolution microscopy applications 12 . Our experimental process included the combination of dip - coating method to synthetize sol - gel silica films of controlled thicknesses on borosilicate glass coverslips with Laser Interference Lithography ( LIL ) 13 and NIL lithographic techniques . In a first top - down fabrication step , extensive Si ( 100 ) masters made of nanopillars arrays were obtained by using LIL and transferred by reactive ion etching at low pressure ( see details in the methods section ) . Then , a second step involved the preparation of high quality PolyDiMethylSiloxane ( PDMS ) molds from Si ( 100 ) masters ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) that produce perfectly imprinted silica nano - pillars with controlled diameter and height on silicon , as illustrated in Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 and 3 . We confirmed that our substrates induce controlled plasma membrane deformations by seeding HeLa cells on vertical SiO 2 nanocolumns coated with poly - L - lysine , as revealed from All rights reserved .

Membrane shape induced by vertical nanopillars was also confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) , as shown in Fig . 1 . Altogether these results confirm that soft - NIL engineered vertical SiO 2 nanopillar’s arrays are suitable setups to exert controlled plasma membrane deformations on adherent cells . Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the nanostructuration of SiO 2 substrates by soft Nano - Imprint Lithography to modulate the shape of cellular membranes . The main steps in the fabrication of 1D vertical SiO 2 nanopillar arrays consisted in 1 ) dip - coating of a thin SiO 2 sol - gel layer on high - performance coverslips , 2 ) stamping of the sol - gel layer with a PDMS mold , previously generated by LIL , 3 ) consolidation of the SiO 2 sol - gel layer at high temperature ( 140 ° C ) to create solid 1D vertical SiO 2 nanostructures , as revealed by the SEM image . 4 ) Seeding of adherent cells on nanostructured SiO 2 substrates allows to exert nanopillar - induced membrane deformations , as visualized by either SEM ( right and central panel ) or fluorescence microscopy of cell membrane lipids ( red , left panel ) .

Z - projection images of the entire pillar’s length in Fig . 2a show that the actin cytoskeleton is organized around 1D nanopillars but not enriched with respect to other regions of the cell ( away from pillars ) , as revealed by a median enrichment index ( E , see the methods section ) of E ~ 1 for any of the dimensions tested in this study and displayed in Fig . 2b . The 3D reconstruction of HeLa cells seeded on nanopillars arrays of D ~ 600 nm ( circular shape ) and co - immunostained against key endocytic proteins such as clathrin and AP - 2 14 and the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) 15 displayed in Fig . 2c shows a distinct 3D localization of the four cellular markers . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is found all over the membrane that wraps up the nanopillar structure , whereas actin , clathrin and AP - 2 preferentially localize at the base of nanopillar , although clathrin is also organized all along the pillar’s length . The profile analysis of the actin , clathrin , and AP - 2 signals suggests that the three proteins are predominantly associated around the nanopillars ( Fig . 2d ) . To confirm that the organization of actin , clathrin and AP - 2 at the cell membrane is well imposed by the topography of substrate , we analyzed the 2D autocorrelation of the three fluorescent signals on HeLa cells seeded on 1D nanopillar’s displaying two different shapes : circular shape ( D ~ 400 nm ) and square shape ( D ~ 850 nm ) , as shown in Fig 2e and f , respectively . We obtained a periodic distribution of 1086 ± 70 nm , 1047 ± 50 nm , and 1041 ± 60 nm for cells seeded on pillars of D ~ 400 nm , and 2409 ± 4 nm , 2374 ± 10 nm and 2405 ± 20 nm ( mean ± s . d . , N ³ 5 ) for cells seeded on pillars of D ~ 850 nm , for actin , AP - 2 and clathrin , respectively ( arrowheads , Fig . 2e - f ) , in agreement with the distribution of the engineered SiO 2 nanopillar’s arrays ( Supplementary table 1 ) . Moreover , we found a long - range patterning for either actin , AP - 2 and clathrin signals , suggesting that the transduction of topographical cues by the cell is not a discrete process . The distribution of the autocorrelation amplitude was of ~ 20 % for all the three proteins on the circular shape pillar and shifted to lower values for AP - 2 as compared to the ~ 25 % amplitude obtained for actin and All rights reserved .

High magnification of long - range 2D periodic lattices showed ring - like isotropic organization of actin around nanopillars irrespective of the pillar’s shape , whereas clathrin and AP - 2 display an isotropic organization on circular shape pillars and anisotropic in the case of square shape nanopillars ( insets , Fig . 2e and f ) . The different behaviors observed might reflect the distinct nature of membrane association of these proteins and the different supra - molecular organization , as a result of their intrinsic ability to form semi - flexible polymers , such as actin 16 , or to oligomerize into a lattice - like structures , as in the case of clathrin 17 . Collectively , these results indicate a topography - mediated organization of clathrin and AP - 2 at the plasma membrane that is associated to the presence of the actin cytoskeleton around the nanopillar’s base .

Next , we assessed if the range of membrane shapes selected in this study and imposed by the underlying 1D nanopillar’s arrays where the cells are seeded might enhance the accumulation of endocytic proteins , for instance as previously reported by in cellulo studies during cell - cell fusion 7 . The immunostaining of AP - 2 and clathrin on HeLa cells seeded on vertical nanopillars of D ~ 400 nm , D ~ 600 nm and , D ~ 850 nm revealed that both proteins preferentially accumulate at the plasma membrane - nanopillar interface compared to regions of the cell membrane that are adhered to the flat substrate ( not on pillars ) , as shown in Fig . 3a - b . Indeed , we estimated in all cases a median value of E ≥ 2 , which was steady at E ~ 2 . 5 for AP - 2 , irrespective of the nanopillar’s dimensions , and 2 ≤ E ≤ 3 . 5 in the case of clathrin . This behavior was specific of clathrin - associated proteins , as revealed by a preferential enrichment of the endocytic protein caveolin - 1 18 on nanopillar’s arrays of D ~ 600 nm with an E ~ 4 but not on other pillar’s dimensions ( E ≤ 1 . 5 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) .

This behavior agrees with the fact that dynamin - 2 was also localized together with clathrin in large membranes protrusion during osteoclast cell - cell fusion 7 . Finally , the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , which is a clathrin - internalized cargo responsible for gene expression regulation 19 , showed a size - dependent enrichment with a preferential accumulation of the receptor for nanopillars of D ~ 400 nm ( E ~ 2 . 5 ) but not for dimensions D ≥ 600 nm ( E ~ 1 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . This observation is consistent with the strong preference of endocytic “canonical” clathrin - coated structures for positive curvatures with a diameter < 400 nm . A possible explanation for the steady accumulation of clathrin and AP - 2 at the plasma membrane - pillar interphase , irrespective of the pillar’s dimensions , might rely on the local membrane lipid composition . Indeed , plasma membrane phosphoinositides ( PIs ) are key regulators of the clathrin - coat assembly and maturation during endocytosis 15 and are implicated in actin polymerization 20 . The endogenous localization of the main PIs present at the plasma membrane - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - of HeLa cells seeded on vertical nanopillars of different dimensions was revealed by immunostaining using fluorescent recombinant PI - binding motifs 21 and showed an absence of significant enrichment of PIs due to the pillar’s topographical stimuli with an E ≤ 1 . 5 ( Supplementary Fig . 8a - b ) . Thus , the steady accumulation of clathrin and AP - 2 due to topography features is not likely to rely on the local segregation of PIs , although we could not exclude that a moderate but local fold increase of 1 ≤ E ≤ 1 . 5 might be enough to trigger an acute PI - mediated response and thus , future experiments should be conducted in this direction . The consistent organization of actin around vertical nanopillars irrespective of their dimensions and the linear correlation that we found between the enrichment of clathrin and AP - 2 with the presence of F - actin ( Fig . 3c ) , led us wonder if the sustained accumulation of endocytic proteins might be an actin - mediated process . To test this hypothesis , we subjected HeLa cells previously seeded on nanopillar’s arrays of D ~ 600 nm to two actin modulating drugs : Cytochalasin D All rights reserved .

We found that CytoD treatment did lead to an absence of difference in the accumulation of clathrin and AP - 2 on pillars , possibly as a result of the formation of actin patches around nanopillars that we observed on cells treated with this drug . This was not the case of cells treated with jasplakinolide , which showed a 2 - fold increase in the median enrichment value , E , for both AP - 2 and clathrin . These results suggest that the accumulation of AP - 2 and clathrin in response to a topographical stimulus would rely on the formation of actin networks , typically occurring at the base of vertical nanopillars ( Fig . 2 and Fig . 3e ) .

The strong coupling of the plasma membrane to the underlying actin cortex is an essential regulator of the mechanical state of the cell membrane 9 . As a result , we reasoned that the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton that we observed in response to the topography of 1D vertical nanopillars might be transduced by a change in the plasma membrane tension . We estimated the tension of the plasma membrane - pillar interface of HeLa cells seeded on 1D vertical nanopillars by using the fluorescent membrane tension sensor FliptR , which provides a direct estimation of the membrane tension of living cells by using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) , as previously reported 22 . The resulting mean FliptR lifetime showed that plasma membrane tension increases by decreasing the nanopillar’s dimension , i . e . τ = 4 . 19 ± 0 . 34 , τ = 4 . 05 ± 0 . 38 τ = 3 . 97 ± 0 . 19 ( mean ± s . d . ) , for D ~ 400 nm , D ~ 600 nm , D ~ 850 nm , respectively ( Fig . 4a - b ) , therefore suggesting that for an equivalent projected area the force generated by the actin network organization around nanopillars of different dimensions and transmitted to the cell cortex should have a different contribution on the apparent plasma membrane tension .

This observation suggests that on large membrane deformations induced by vertical nanostructures the membrane - association of clathrin and AP - 2 would be dominated by the force generated by functional actin networks over the contractility - independent mechanotransduction that was previously reported for clathrin - coated structures 24 , at least under relatively high substrate rigidly conditions . Next , we wonder whether different modes of dynamics might be associated to the clathrin and AP - 2 structures present on nanopillars compared to conventional flat glass substrates . Spinning disk confocal analysis of genome edited SUM - 159 cells expressing the s 2 subunit of the AP - 2 complex fused to EGFP showed a homogenous distribution of AP - 2 along the basal cell membrane of cells seeded on conventional glass substrates compared to the accumulation of stable AP - 2 at the membrane - pillar interface ( Fig . 4d ) . Moreover , AP - 2 structures associated to nanopillars display a 1 . 5 - fold increase in both the maximum intensity and mean lifetime as well as the appearance of a population of structures shifted towards longer lifetimes to those expected for “canonical” coated pits , i . e . > 60 s 25 , as compared to flat substrates . Collectively , these results suggest that topographical cues imposed by the large vertical nanostructures , D > 400 nm , drive the formation of stable clathrin / AP - 2 structures , with a similar dynamic to that reported for long - lived and large clathrin lattices 25 .

In conclusion our work shows the potential of a straight - forward and cost - effective nanostructuration method based on soft - NIL to engineer well - defined arrays of vertical nanostructures to investigate the effect of sustained external topographical cues on the mechanochemical response of the cell plasma membrane . This novel strategy of high - performance glass nanostructuration combined to super - resolution microscopy technique has provided unprecedented insight on the mechanistic behind the topography - driven organization of the actin cytoskeleton and a subset of endocytic proteins . Our results show that the membrane morphology imposed by the topography of vertical nanostructures larger than 400 nm templates the organization of stable clathrin / AP - 2 structures , a process that is assisted by the force - generated and remodeling of functional actin networks at the base of nanopillars . Therefore , cells might engage a morphology - dependent response to the topographical features of the external environment : by privileging a curvature - sensing response and the formation of clathrin - coated hotspots at diameters < 400 nm 1 , 2 or a local force - sensing response with the formation of stable clathrin - coated structures at larger membrane shapes , > 400 nm , as we showed in this study .

Gel films by dip - coating : layer gel films on high - performance coverslips made of borosilicate glass of the first hydrolytic class with precision thickness No . 1 . 5 ( 0 . 170 ± 0 . 005 mm ) at room temperature were prepared with a ND - DC300 dip - coater ( Nadetech Innovations ) equipped with an EBC10 Miniclima Device to control the surrounding temperature and relative humidity . During the dip - coating , we fixed the ambient temperature and relative humidity as 20ºC and 45 - 50 % and the thickness of film was controlled by the withdrawal rate . In this study , all the films were made at withdrawal rate of 300 mm / min i . e . 200 nm thick to ensure the nanoimprint process . After dip - coating , as - prepared gel films were consolidated with a thermal treatment of 5 min at 430 ºC under air atmosphere . Silica thin film nanostructuration Molds preparation : Si masters were elaborated using LIL Lithography as previously reported 10 , 11 . Briefly , this procedure allows to quickly obtain periodic patterns on silicon substrates of controlled shape ( square and circular , as previously described 26 , diameter and periodicity over a large surface ( ∼ cm 2 ) without the need of a lithographic mask 13 . PDMS ( polydimethylsiloxane ) reactants ( 90 w % RTV141A ; 10 w % RTV141B from BLUESIL ) were transferred onto the master and dried at 70 °C for 1 h before unmolding . Then , a first silica layer seed was deposited at a constant relative humidity of 45 - 50 % at 20ºC with controlled withdrawal speeds of 300 mm min − 1 in order to adjust the final thickness to 200 nm , and was consolidated at 430ºC for 5 min . Importantly , this film has an important functionality as an adhesion layer to faultlessly replicate the columnar shape from the PDMS mold . Then , a new layer of the same solution was deposited under the same conditions for printing . Imprinting of sol – gel films with a PDMS mold involves the following steps . First , molds were degassed under vacuum ( 10 mbar ) for 20 min before direct application on the as - prepared xerogel films kept in a controlled environment , without additional pressure .

Next , the sol – gel replicas were annealed at 430 °C for 10 min for consolidation . Notice that , a new multiple replication process to reduce the dimensions of silica nanopillars in a controlled manner has been developed . This method consisted of producing PDMS molds from each sol - gel replica successively as illustrated in supplementary figure 3 , then the silica nanopillar reduces their dimension of 40 % each NIL process which correspond around 200 nm less in height from the original silicon master , after consolidation at 430 °C during 10 min .

A 0 . 15 μ m z - step was used to cover all the nanopillars length in every z - stack acquisition . Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of live cells FLIM measurement of FliptR lifetime on living cells were performed as previously reported 22 . Briefly , Hela cells were seeded on nanostructured SiO 2 structures overnight as stated above . Then , the culture medium was replaced with the same medium containing 1 . 5 µM of the FliptR probe and incubated for 10 min . FLIM imaging was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti A1R microscope equipped with a Time Correlated Single - Photon Counting module from PicoQuant . Excitation was performed using a pulsed 485nm laser ( PicoQuant , LDH - D - C - 485 ) operating at 20 MHz , and emission signal was collected through a bandpass 600 / 50 nm filter using a gated PMA hybrid detector and a TimeHarp 260 PICO board ( PicoQuant ) . SymPhoTime 64 software ( PicoQuant ) was then used to fit the fluorescence decay data ( from either full images or regions of interest ) to a dual exponential model after deconvolution for the instrument response function . Data analysis and processing The preferential localization of each cellular component of interest at the plasma membrane interface with the vertical nanopillars was determined by estimating an enrichment ( E ) , as detailed as follows , E = ( I p / I f ) SOI / ( I p / I f ) membrane , which reports the ratio between a signal of interest ( SOI ) , at the plasma membrane bent by the pillars ( Ip ) versus the SOI at the flat membrane surface ( If , not on pillar ) . This ratio was then normalized by an unspecific plasma membrane marker ( e . g . mCherry - MyrPalm ) on pillars and not on pillars to correct for topographical artifacts on our estimations . We considered that an E > 1 reports that the SOI has a preference for the plasma membrane that is at the interface with the nanopillar . Thus , the higher the E , the larger the tendency of a SOI to be localized on All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Conversely , an E of 1 or below would indicate that there is no preferential localization of a SOI for either the membrane that is bent over the pillar or the plasma membrane that is adhered on the flat substrate . The enrichment ( E ) was obtained from maximum intensity projection of z - stack images acquired by Airyscan imaging . Each acquisition was treated by using a semi - automatic detection of each SOI on pillars and not on pillars using built - in macro functions and the ImageJ software 31 . 2D autocorrelation analysis of maximum intensity projection of z - stack images acquired by Airyscan imaging was performed using Gwyddion ( http : / / gwyddion . net / ) . Data representation and statistical analysis 3D representations of airyscan images were generated with the 3 / 4D visualization and analysis software Imaris ( Oxford Instruments ) .
