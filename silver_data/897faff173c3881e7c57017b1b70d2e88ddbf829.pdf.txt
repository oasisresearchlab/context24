Information needs in office practice : Are they being met ? Covell DG , Uman GC , Manning PR We studied the self - reported information needs of 47 physicians during a half day of typical office practice . The physicians raised 269 questions about patient management . Questions related to all medical specialties and were highly specific to the individual patient’s problem . Subspecialists most frequently asked questions related to other subspecialties . Only 30 % of physicians’ information needs were met during the patient visit , usually by another physician or other health professional . Reasons print sources were not used included the age of textbooks in the office , poor organization of journal articles , inadequate indexing of books and drug information sources , lack of knowledge of an appropriate source , and the time required to find the desired information . Better methods are needed to provide answers to questions that arise in office practice . Abstract in Annals of Internal Medicine 1985 ; 103 ( 4 ) : 596 - 9 .
