A growing body of evidence suggests that the dynamic lymphocyte microvilli , with their highly curved membranes , play an important role in signal transduction leading to immune responses . Nevertheless , challenges in modulating local membrane curvature and monitoring the high dynamicity of microvilli hampered the investigation of the curvature - generation mechanism and its functional consequences in signaling . These technical barriers have been partially overcome by recent advancements in adapted super - resolution microscopy . Here , we review the up - to - date progress in understanding the mechanisms and functional consequences of microvillus formation in T cell signaling .

A variety of membrane protrusions have been identiﬁed on the cell surface , including microvilli , ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia , and cilia ( see Table 1 ) . Those structures play a classical function in sensing the environmental cues as well as facilitating cell migration . Meanwhile , accumulating evidence suggests that membrane protrusions also play an active role in regulating biochemical reactions that transduce membrane - proximal signaling ( 1 – 3 ) , and dysregulation of their formation has been associated with diseases like Huntington’s disease , PAPA syndrome , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , and renal dysfunction ( 4 – 6 ) . In the immune system , microvilli are among the most common types of membrane protrusions found on lymphocytes . Although they have been well - described by electron microscopy ( EM ) studies ( 7 ) , the biochemical and signaling functions of microvilli remained neglected until recently . In this review , we discuss the potential of physical feature of microvilli in regulating chemical reactions that transduce membrane - proximal signaling . We also summarize the development of new techniques for imaging cell surface topography at high spatial or temporal resolutions , and for modulating membrane curvature in a precision manner , which could provide powerful tools for investigating the signaling function of microvilli .

They are supported by actin ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) that are organized in parallel bundles of 10 – 30 ﬁlaments ( 12 , 13 ) , which resemble the actin network that constitutes ﬁlopodia ( 14 ) . However , ﬁlopodia often protrude from the lamellipodial and lamellar actin network ( 15 ) , while the microvilli actin network does not ( 16 , 17 ) . In the case of lymphocytes , EM studies showed the presence of microvilli on the surface of both T cells and B cells ( 18 ) . The diameter of the microvilli ranges from 50 to 550 nm , as revealed by EM and ﬂuorescence microscopy studies , while their length varies between 100 nm to several microns ( Figure 1 ) ( 7 , 13 , 19 , 20 ) . Thus , microvilli dramatically increase the cell surface area , while having a negligible eﬀect on the cytosolic volume . Furthermore , actin depolymerizing toxin Latrunculin A ( LatA ) eliminates most microvilli within 1 min in a reversible manner , suggesting that microvilli are highly dynamic structures ( 13 ) . Recent technological advances in lattice light - sheet microscopy allow 3D real - time tracing of such dynamic microvilli ( 20 ) . It was discovered that microvilli move laterally on the plasma membrane and survey antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) within 1 min , which is , coincidently or not , the half - life of T cell – APC contact duration in vivo ( 20 ) . Therefore , the dynamics of microvilli ﬁts well into their function in searching antigens . Despite a handful of studies on microvilli morphology , our knowledge on the regulatory mechanism of microvilli size , structure , and dynamics is still limited . Evidently , their fate following the formation of immunological synapse is still a matter of debate . Cai et al . ( 20 ) demonstrated that there is no change in the microvilli density before and after the immunological synapse is formed . In contrast , Kim et al . ( 21 ) showed that at an early stage of synapse development microvilli polarize toward the synapse , but as the synapse matures , most of the microvilli disappear . The later was further supported by a recent study by Ghosh et al . ( 22 ) , showing the loss of the microvilli after T cell receptor ( TCR ) stimulation . The microvilli are also regulated by cytokines and chemokines . Westerberg et al . ( 23 ) found that CD40 antibody together with IL - 4 induces microvilli on the surface of B cells . On the other hand , the chemokines stromal derived factor 1 α ( SDF - 1 α ) and B lymphocyte chemokine ( BLC ) induce resorption of microvilli ( 24 , 25 ) , which promotes B cell homing by transition from rolling adhesion to integrin - mediated adhesion . Not surprisingly , members of the ezrin - radixin - moesin ( ERM ) family , which link the cortical F - actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane , were found to regulate microvilli assembly , namely , dephosphorylation of ERM proteins ( ezrin , T567 ; radixin , T564 , moesin , T558 ) , induced by chemokines , results in resorption of microvilli within a few seconds ( 25 , 26 ) . Because ERM dephosphorylation can be triggered by TCR activation ( 27 ) , ERM could mediate TCR - induced microvilli resorption ( 22 ) . Interestingly , changes in the microvilli shape and density are also linked to several diseases . Uneven distribution of long microvilli was observed on B cells from hairy cell leukemia patients ( 28 – 31 ) . Moreover , changes in microvilli morphology were observed in WAS , a severe immunodeﬁciency disorder that is caused by defective or missing Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) . WASp activates Arp2 / 3 complex by inducing a conformational change of Arp2 / 3 and by delivering the ﬁrst actin monomer of the nascent ﬁlament ( 32 – 36 ) .

It has been demonstrated that lymphocytes derived from patients with WAS , either in resting or activated states , exhibit various microvillar morphological abnormalities . These abnormalities include a decrease in microvilli density and length , as well as formation of dysmorphic structures ( 5 , 24 , 38 – 42 ) . However , knockdown of Arp2 in Jurkat T cells caused no signiﬁcant eﬀect on microvilli assembly ( 43 ) , which suggests that WASp might regulate microvilli formation independent of Arp2 / 3 . Meanwhile , further studies are required to conﬁrm the Arp2 phenotype in primary T cells . CAN MICROVILLI SERVE AS A SIGNALING CENTER ? The notion that microvilli could serve as a signaling center was primed by studies showing that certain signaling proteins are enriched in microvilli . Immunogold EM studies demonstrated the enrichment of various receptors and adhesion molecules on the microvilli , including insulin receptors , selectin , integrin , and the T cell co - receptor CD4 ( 44 – 49 ) . Mass - spectrometry analysis was also implemented to compare the protein composition between isolated microvilli and whole cell , from both human peripheral blood T - lymphocytes and a mouse pre - B lymphocyte line ( 50 ) . It revealed that microvilli are enriched of GTP - binding proteins , cytoskeletal proteins , and transmembrane proteins as compared to the cell body ( after removing the nucleus ) . This study provides the ﬁrst global mapping of the microvilli proteome . However , it should be noted that using the cell body as a control could lead to the identiﬁcation of membrane - associated proteins rather than microvilli - speciﬁc proteins , because the surface - to - volume ratio is much higher in microvilli as compared to the cytoplasm . It should be also noted that the identiﬁcation of membrane proteins by mass - spectrometry remains as a challenge because of the proteins limited solubility in aqueous buﬀer ( 51 ) . Therefore , certain hits might be missing in the dataset . Thus , orthogonal approaches will be needed to verify the microvilli - enriched proteins . For many years the dynamic nature of microvilli together with their small dimensions have hindered the structural and functional characterization of microvilli . Although EM provides high spatial resolutions , understanding the signaling function of microvilli requires characterizing microvilli morphology and signaling protein localization with high temporal resolutions . The advancement of ﬂuorescence microscopy techniques in the past decades has enabled an investigation of membrane morphology and protein localization in microvilli at either high temporal or spatial resolutions , though the combination of both is still technically challenging ( 19 – 22 , 52 , 53 ) . The Haran group comprehensively characterized the localization of TCR signaling proteins on the microvilli by a unique imaging technique that allows accurate mapping of membrane protein localization . By combining variable - angle total internal reﬂection microscopy and stochastic localization nanoscopy , the authors reconstructed 3D topographical maps of T cells ( 19 , 22 ) . They have shown that TCR , co - receptor FIGURE 2 | TCR localizes to the microvilli tip . Jurkat T cells expressing GFP - V5G and TCR ζ - tdTomato were imaged at the terminal stage of T cell activation . Reproduced from Kim et al . ( 21 ) licensed under Creative Commons ( CC BY 4 . 0 ) . CD4 , kinase Lck , adaptor LAT , and adhesion receptor CD2 are highly enriched in the microvilli . On the sub - microvilli scale , the Jun group , using Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , showed that TCR is speciﬁcally enriched on the microvilli tip ( Figure 2 ) ( 21 ) . Thus , the tip localization of TCR could promote searching of antigens and establishing contacts with APCs ( 20 ) . The Haran group also found that treatment with LatA or expressing a dominant negative form of ezrin , both of which reduce microvilli , leads to a random distribution of TCR throughout the plasma membrane . Intriguingly , the authors showed that following TCR stimulation , T cells lose their microvilli , which consequently leads to an even distribution of TCR αβ throughout the plasma membrane ( 22 ) . This result suggests that microvilli - dependent TCR enrichment could be regulated by TCR triggering . The “kinetic - segregation” model serves as one of the prevalent mechanisms explaining TCR triggering ( 54 – 57 ) . A key part to this model is the segregation of the large tyrosine phosphatase CD45 from the TCR - pMHC contact zone . Therefore , multiple groups have investigated the localization of CD45 in the context of microvilli and showed that the segregation between TCR and CD45 occurs a few seconds after contacts are established ( 58 – 61 ) . Interestingly , although it has been assumed and supported by experimental data that CD45 is evenly distributed on the cell surface in resting T cells ( 19 , 60 ) , a new study revealed , using expansion microscopy , that CD45 is excluded from the microvilli tip even before contacts are established with APC ( 53 ) . These discrepancies could be caused by diﬀerences in T cell subtypes , activation methods , and resolution of individual imaging techniques . Summarizing localization studies above , key components mediating TCR - proximal signaling reside in microvilli . These include TCR itself , kinase Lck , and adaptor LAT . It is expected that cytosolic proteins that are associated with these membrane proteins , including ZAP70 , Grb2 , Sos1 , PLC γ 1 , Gads , and SLP76 , are likely to be enriched in microvilli as well . The physical proximity of these molecules could increase the rate of chemical reactions and eﬃciency of signal transduction . Microvilli , therefore , could serve as a compartment to enrich Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 3 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 2187 ﬁmmu - 11 - 02187 September 9 , 2020 Time : 19 : 38 # 4 Orbach and Su Lymphocyte Microvilli for Signaling FIGURE 3 | Schematic of the microvilli and the organization of different signaling proteins on the microvilli . Many of the signaling molecules that are involved in T cell activation preferentially localize to the microvilli . Yet , their organization within the microvilli is not known ( marked in question mark ) . Green , microvilli tip region ; red , microvilli body ; black , plasma membrane . signaling proteins to promote TCR signaling ( Figure 3 ) . In this regard , T cell microclusters are another entity that has been proposed for promoting TCR signaling ( 62 , 63 ) . Because both microvilli - localized proteins and T cell microcluster components display a puncta - like structure on the cell membrane , it raises an interesting question on the relationship between the two . Current evidence suggests that these two entities are diﬀerent but related structures . The microvilli - enriched proteins are mostly characterized in resting T cells and microvilli disappear , at least in some studies , after TCR activation ( 22 ) . In contrast , T cell microclusters are formed after TCR activation ( 62 , 63 ) . They also displayed limited mobility as compared to the highly mobile microvilli ( 20 ) . Meanwhile , the “pre - enrichment” of signaling components in microvilli could facilitate T microcluster formation upon TCR activation . Besides a potential signaling function in T cells , microvilli have also been proposed by the Jun Lab to serve as precursors for generating TCR - enriched extracellular vesicles ( or synaptosomes ) that activate dendritic cells ( 21 ) . It remains to be determined whether the synaptosomes are similar or diﬀerent to other TCR - enriched microvesicles ( synaptic ectosomes ) that were described by the Dustin Lab ( 64 ) . Ectosomes are generated by the ESCRT complex , of which TSG101 facilitates the sorting of TCR into the ectosomes whereas Vps4 facilitates the scission of ectosomes from the plasma membrane . Interestingly , CD40L , a key eﬀector delivered by helper T cells to activate APC , is also enriched in the microvilli and ectosomes , though CD40L is spatially segregated from TCR in ectosomes ( 65 ) . This probably suggests that TCR and CD40L are independently sorted into microvilli , whereas the exact mechanism needs to be determined . It also remains as an intriguing question on how many microvilli and their associated TCRs end up in synaptosomes or ectosomes . Is ESCRT , a general membrane - shaping machinery , involved in microvilli dynamics regulation and resorption ? Answering these questions will help to generate a complete picture of the microvilli life cycle during T cell activation ( 65 ) . MECHANISMS FOR INDUCING MEMBRANE CURVATURE AND PROTEIN ENRICHMENT Highly curved membranes represent a unique feature of microvilli , which could also serve as a platform for enriching proteins in microvilli . Several mechanisms have been proposed for generating curved membranes . Polymerization of actin Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 4 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 2187 ﬁmmu - 11 - 02187 September 9 , 2020 Time : 19 : 38 # 5 Orbach and Su Lymphocyte Microvilli for Signaling ﬁlaments drives membrane protrusion ; in parallel , membrane - associated proteins can also induce membrane curvature by the insertion of conical transmembrane proteins or hydrophobic protein domains into the membrane ( 66 , 67 ) . Intriguingly , intrinsically disordered domains , when attached to membranes , can drive membrane protrusion either with a positive or negative curvature ( 68 – 70 ) . The Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) superfamily is a key player involved in regulation , formation , and detection of cell membrane curvature ( 71 ) . In this superfamily , the N - BAR and the F - BAR are associated with positive curvatures ( e . g . , membrane invagination or endocytic pits ) . In contrast , the I - BAR subfamily of proteins is associated with negative curvatures as found in various membrane protrusions ( 72 ) . Many members of the BAR superfamily contain the structurally conserved SH2 or SH3 domains that recruit their binding partners to the curved membranes ( 73 ) . One particular interesting example is the I - BAR protein IRSp53 ( also known as BAIAP2 ) that binds cytoskeletal eﬀectors such as N - WASP through its SH3 domain ( 74 ) . In an in vitro biochemical assay , IRSp53 induces tubular membrane protrusions with similar dimensions of microvilli ( 75 ) . IRSp53 is localized to ﬁlopodia when ectopically expressed in neuronal NSC34 cells ( 76 ) and regulates ﬁlopodia dynamics ( 77 ) . Interestingly , IRSp53 is also expressed in T cells ( 78 ) , raising its possible role in regulating microvilli formation . Surprisingly , the N - BAR protein sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) , which is expected to recognize positive curvatures , is involved the biogenesis of ﬁlopodia ( 79 ) . In a cell - free system for reconstituting actin bundles of ﬁlopodia ( 80 ) , immunodepletion of SNX9 resulted in shorter actin bundles . Moreover , SNX9 localizes to the ﬁlopodial tip and shaft in RPE - 1 cells ( 79 ) . The positive role of SNX9 in ﬁlopodia formation is dependent on its activity in stimulating N - WASp and Arp2 / 3 ( 81 ) , which probably overrides the curvature - sensing function of the N - BAR domain . In terms of the function of SNX9 in T cells , SNX9 was found to interact with WASp , p85 , and CD28 to form a signaling complex on endocytic vesicles when T cells are activated by soluble CD3 / CD28 antibodies ( 82 ) . It remains to be determined if SNX9 can regulate microvilli when T cells are activated by surface or bilayer - presented stimuli because stimuli with a physical support could cause diﬀerent outcomes as compared to those in a soluble format . Previous reports showed that TCR is internalized through endocytosis when T cells are treated with soluble MHC tetramer ( 83 ) , whereas TCR is sorted into extracellular microvesicles when T cells are activated by supported lipid bilayer ( SLB ) - presented pMHC ( 64 ) . While the BAR proteins sense membrane curvature within the nanometer scale , there are proteins that can also sense a larger length scale . Septins and stage V sporulation protein M ( SpoVM ) sense positive micron - scale curvatures ( 84 , 85 ) . It was suggested that these nanometer - sized proteins sense micron - scale curvature by polymerization into micro - scale ﬁlaments . In contrast , the protein machinery that directly senses micron - or submicron - scale negative curvatures remains to be determined . What is the cellular function of membrane deformation ? Various studies have highlighted the role of membrane curvature in regulating sorting of transmembrane proteins ( 86 – 89 ) . Using patterned nanostructure surfaces , Zhao et al . ( 90 ) found that the protein machinery mediating clathrin - mediated endocytosis prefers a positive curvature with a radius below 200 nm . Liang et al . ( 91 ) discovered that small GTPase Ras senses membrane curvatures in an isoform - dependent manner . One isoform binds to membranes with low curvatures , whereas the other binds to membranes with high curvatures . The eﬀect of local membrane curvature may also inﬂuence cell polarization . For many years it had been assumed that cell polarization is induced exclusively by a gradient of a chemoattractant . A recent report revealed that chemical signaling is not suﬃcient for inducing cell polarization of neutrophils and CD8 + T cells ( 92 ) . Instead , the authors found that polarization initiates with the formation of curved membranes , which recruits BAR domain protein SRGAP2 , activates PI4KA , and results in PtdIns4P polarization . Furthermore , to understand the mechanism by which membrane curvature aﬀects actin - dependent processes , such as endocytosis , focal adhesion maturation , and stress ﬁber organization , Lou et al . ( 93 ) have used patterned nanostructure surfaces to study actin rearrangement . Intriguingly , the authors found that the actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 and its regulators N - WASP and cortactin are recruited by BAR proteins to membranes with positive curvatures ( with radii < 200 nm ) . Consequently , branched actin networks assemble around curved membranes , depleting the monomeric actin pool for assembling stress ﬁbers and mature focal adhesions . Interestingly , members of the formin family , which promote the polymerization of linear F - actin , showed no preferential localization to curved membranes . The lipid composition of the plasma membrane also inﬂuences membrane geometry and protein localization . The size of the lipid headgroups , their charge , as well as the saturation state of acyl chains determines lipid shapes , and consequently the local membrane curvature ( 66 , 94 ) . Lipids with small headgroups such as cardiolipin , phosphatidylethanolamine , ceramide , diacylglycerol , and phosphatic acid induce negative membrane curvatures , whereas lipids with large headgroups like lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol phosphate induce positive curvatures ( 95 ) . Some of these lipids can also recruit proteins to the membrane . For example , the negatively charged lipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate recruit positively charged proteins by electrostatic interactions ( 96 – 98 ) . Sphingomyelin was found to selectively localize to the microvilli of epithelial cells and to induce microvilli formation through the indirect recruitment of ERM proteins ( 99 ) . Whether this is also the case in lymphocytes and what the role of sphingomyelinase is in regulating microvilli formation need to be further explored . On the other hand , lipids can mediate the exclusion of proteins from curved membranes . A recent intriguing study from Jung et al . showed that CD45 is excluded out of the tip of microvilli in a cholesterol - dependent manner ( 53 ) . Although the localization of cholesterol needs to be determined in the context of microvilli , cholesterol was previously reported to be enriched in the negative curved membranes in vitro or in silico ( 100 , 101 ) , where it , together with sphingomyelin , also thickens the membrane ( 102 , 103 ) . The thickened membrane caused by the accumulation of cholesterol was suggested to exclude CD45 of which the transmembrane domain is not long enough to be integrated into the thickened membrane . Depletion of cholesterol by cyclodextrin reduced the Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org 5 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 2187 ﬁmmu - 11 - 02187 September 9 , 2020 Time : 19 : 38 # 6 Orbach and Su Lymphocyte Microvilli for Signaling exclusion of CD45 from the tip , accompanied by a decrease in the membrane thickness and number of microvilli ( 53 , 104 ) . Besides the contribution from individual lipids , membrane tension , by serving as a physical barrier , can antagonize actin based - protrusion ( 105 ) . The composition and organization of the glycocalyx layer , which covers the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane , also contributes to cell morphology and membrane protrusions ( 106 ) . Mucins are ﬂexible transmembrane glycoprotein polymers within the glycocalyx that are enriched on the surface of many membrane protrusions , such as epithelial microvilli ( 107 ) . A recent study has demonstrated the role of the mucins in generating forces driving the tubularization of the plasma membrane ( 108 ) . In contrast , rigid glycoproteins have not shown similar phenomenon as the mucins . In the case of T cells , many cell surface proteins are highly glycosylated , among which CD43 and CD45 are the most abundant glycoproteins ( 109 , 110 ) . Notably , diﬀerent isoforms of CD45 are expressed at diﬀerent T cell development stages , and these isoforms diﬀer signiﬁcantly in their extracellular domain sizes ( 58 , 111 ) . It remains as an interesting question whether these isoforms contribute diﬀerently to microvilli formation . APPROACHES TO MANIPULATE MICROVILLI AND MEMBRANE CURVATURE Investigation of the microvilli function can be extremely challenging due to limited tools to speciﬁcally manipulate them in cells without perturbing other actin - based processes . Moreover , their small dimensions ( r < 200 nm ) and unique architecture ( i . e . , negative membrane curvature viewed from inside of microvilli ) hamper the application of traditional in vitro reconstitution approach to the study of microvilli . Nevertheless , methods for studying ﬁlopodia , which present similar structural properties as the microvilli , as well as other recent technological advances that enable the accurate shaping of membranes , can be implemented to interrogate microvilli . Genetic Approaches In microvilli the actin ﬁlaments are organized in parallel bundles ( 13 ) . Various crosslinkers such as fascin , ﬁmbrin , and espin promote the formation of actin bundles ( 112 – 115 ) . While direct evidence is required , these actin crosslinkers can be attractive targets for speciﬁcally modulating microvilli shape and density , as demonstrated in ﬁlopodia ( 113 ) . The ERM family , another component involved in microvilli formation , plays a major role in connecting actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane . Overexpressing a dominant - negative form of ezrin dramatically reduces microvilli formation ( 24 ) . Yet , a recent ﬁnding suggests that the enrichment of ezrin around membrane protrusions is facilitated by I - BAR - domain proteins ( 116 ) . Pharmacological Approaches Complementing genetic manipulations , pharmacological treatments perturbing membrane composition or cytoskeleton can modulate microvilli in a rapid fashion . Greicius et al . ( 104 ) reported a decrease in microvilli density by depleting cholesterol using cyclodextrin . A similar eﬀect could be achieved by using the actin depolymerizing toxin LatA ( 13 , 19 ) . However , both drugs are expected to aﬀect the whole membrane structure , actin network , and surface presence of many signaling proteins , all of which may complicate the interpretation of the results regarding microvilli - speciﬁc functions . Recently , an inhibitor of the crosslinker protein fascin has been identiﬁed , which could be potentially used to manipulate microvilli . This inhibitor blocks the activity of fascin to bundle actin ﬁlaments in vitro , and ﬁlopodial formation in multiple cell lines . Furthermore , it blocks cancer cell metastasis , potentially by inhibiting ﬁlopodia formation ( 117 ) . Physical Approaches In vitro assays have been developed to isolate the eﬀect of membrane curvature from complex cellular environment . Yet , while methods to generate positive membrane curvature are well established , it is not the case with negative membrane curvatures , especially in the range of microvillus sizes ( r < 200 nm ) . In one approach , a giant unilamellar vesicle ( GUV ) is held by a micropipette at one side and pulled , on the other side , by a polystyrene bead holding by optical traps ( Figure 4A ) . A membrane nanotube can be generated with controlled radii , ranging from 7 to 100 nm , by adjusting the micropipette pressure ( 118 ) . Similarly , an optical trap has been used to pull short tethers ( r < 100 nm ) from the cell membrane ( 119 ) . Meanwhile , these manipulations are technically challenging and may be time - consuming . GUVs are also sensitive to osmotic changes and therefore can bring diﬃculty to long - duration experiments . Alternative approaches to study negative curvature FIGURE 4 | Methods to physically manipulate membrane curvature .

Focused ion beam has been applied to etch an array of invaginations with a radius of 100 nm on a glass surface ( 120 ) . The fabricated substrate can then be covered with SLB to mimic the highly curved membranes in microvilli . Another promising means to induce membrane curvature is by using nanofabricated substrates ( 90 , 121 ) . Yet , the diﬀusion of membrane components may be aﬀected by the substrate ( 122 , 123 ) , which should be carefully evaluated beforehand . OUTLOOK Looking forward , signiﬁcant questions remain to be addressed in terms of the mechanism and signaling function of T cell microvilli : ( 1 ) What are the mechanisms that regulate microvilli formation and dynamics ? Besides identifying the key protein and lipid components regulating microvilli , it will also be necessary to understand the relationship between microvilli and other membrane structures , for example , the recently identiﬁed CD2 Corolla which seems to be devoid of microvilli ( 124 ) . ( 2 ) How do microvilli regulate the localization and oligomerization state of proteins and lipids ? Phase separation , or the formation of liquid - like microclusters , emerges as a new principle in regulating TCR signaling ( 125 , 126 ) . The unique membrane topology in microvilli could play an important role in regulating the assembly of signaling microclusters . On the other hand , microvilli could bring proteins physically close even if there are no direct interactions between those proteins . Future co - localization studies should be best performed in the context of microvilli to understand the exact nature of the entities that are examined . In addition , many other tiny and transient proteo - lipid nanodomains have been identiﬁed on the plasma membrane ( 127 – 130 ) . It remains as an open question on the relationship between these structures and the microvilli - localized proteins . ( 3 ) How do microvilli modulate chemical reactions ? The src - family kinase Lck has been shown to be enriched in microvilli ( 22 ) . Future studies are expected to reveal the microvilli localization or even sub - microvilli localization ( tip , side , or base ) of other enzymes in the TCR signaling ( e . g . , PLC γ 1 , ZAP70 , SHP1 , CBL ) , together with their corresponding substrates . Elegant reconstitution approaches will be needed to recapitulate the essential physical and chemical environment of microvilli to understand how curved membranes in microvilli aﬀect the speciﬁc activity of kinases , phosphatases , and lipases . ( 4 ) How do microvilli regulate TCR signal transduction ? As protrusive structures that search the surrounding space and make contacts with the APCs , microvilli are constantly experiencing mechanical forces from the environment ( 131 ) . These forces may be involved in the regulation of cell recognition and calcium ﬂux , as found in the microvillar photoreceptor cells ( 132 ) . Moreover , TCRs on the tip of the microvilli receive stimuli from APCs . Meanwhile , what happens after antigen recognition remains unclear . How is signal transduced from the tip of microvilli to the cell body ? Do microvilli participate in kinetic proof - reading since microvilli are enriched with proteins mediating multiple steps along the TCR pathway ? Do microvilli serve as a signaling unit that integrates signals from TCR and co - receptors ﬁrst before sending them to the cell body , or are diﬀerent signals transduced individually across the microvilli ? With these questions being addressed , the current map of T cell membrane signaling is likely to be signiﬁcantly expanded from a 2D surface to a 3D world .
