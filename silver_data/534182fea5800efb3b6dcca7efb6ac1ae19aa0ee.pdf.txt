Genre information can serve as a means to measure and enhance the diversity of recommenda - tions and is readily available in domains such as movies , mu - sic or books . In this work we propose a new Binomial frame - work for deﬁning genre diversity in recommender systems that takes into account three key properties : genre coverage , genre redundancy and recommendation list size - awareness . We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity – including those adapted from search result diversiﬁcation – fail to address adequately these three properties . We also propose an ef - ﬁcient greedy optimization technique to optimize Binomial diversity . Experiments with the Netﬂix dataset show the properties of our framework and comparison with state of the art methods .

INTRODUCTION Recommender Systems [ 1 ] are intelligent personalized In - formation Retrieval tools where the information need of a user is fully or partially expressed by means of her proﬁle or history rather than a query . The Recommender Systems literature has mostly focused on optimizing the accuracy of their results , either by predicting the preference for an item by a user ( rating prediction task ) or by selecting a list of items to present to the user ( top - N recommendation task ) . Focusing solely on accuracy involves the risk of producing dull recommendations that do not capture all the facets of interest to the users . Additional properties such as diversity , novelty , explicability and context - awareness are key to ex - pand the users’ options and make recommendations more informative and useful . This paper tackles the diversity problem for recommendations . Most users have quite diverse tastes even within the same domain such as movies or books . For example , in the movie ∗ Work conducted during research stay at Telef´onica Re - search .

Standard recommender systems , especially content based al - gorithms [ 1 ] , fail to address this diversity of tastes . Rec - ommendation list diversiﬁcation techniques can solve the user’s need for more varied recommendations and help her discover new products ( music , movies , apps ) . Diversity is a list - wise property that has been shown to enhance the user satisfaction with respect to the recommendations [ 14 ] . Sev - eral notions of diversity have been proposed in the ﬁeld and , although they are closely related , they are not equivalent . In this paper we focus on the notion of intra - list diversity [ 22 ] , i . e . , providing a list of varied recommendations that covers the diﬀerent interests of the user . We deﬁne the notion of diversity using genres , which are used in domains such as books , movies and music . We analyze the properties of genres and their utility in pro - viding diverse recommendations . We postulate three impor - tant properties that genre - based diverse recommendations should fulﬁll : 1 ) genre coverage , that is , each genre should be represented in a recommendation list according to both the interest of the user and its speciﬁcity ; 2 ) redundancy : while it is important that all genres are represented it is equally important not to over - represent a particular genre – this is particularly important in domains where items can have more than one genre ; and 3 ) recommendation list size - awareness , which focuses on the common screen space limi - tation to oﬀer recommendations , and how it inﬂuences genre coverage and redundancy . Our analysis of state of the art diversiﬁcation methods and metrics shows that they do not properly or fully address these three properties . We pro - pose a new Binomial framework that takes into account all the aforementioned properties . The framework consists of a metric to assess the diversity of recommendations and a greedy re - ranking strategy to optimize the diversity of rec - ommendations . We report experiments on a widely - known dataset for recommendation – Netﬂix 1 – showing the prop - erties of our framework , and comparing it to state of the art methods . 2 . RELATED WORK We start by reviewing the related work and positioning our research with respect to the state - of - the - art . First , we present diversity as a key dimension of recommendation util - ity , and compare it to notions of diversity developed in the ﬁeld of Information Retrieval . Second , we present the cur - rent state - of - the - art techniques for modeling recommenda - tion diversity that our work compares to . 2 . 1 Diversity in Recommender Systems Along with the progress targeting accuracy in Recom - mender Systems , researchers have realized that improving 1 http : / / www . netflixprize . com / recommendations’ usefulness and user satisfaction may re - quire more than being accurate . In particular , Herlocker et al . [ 10 ] stated that accuracy alone may not give users of recommender systems an eﬀective and satisfying experience . McNee et al . [ 13 ] further speciﬁed that there are properties other than accuracy that have an eﬀect on user satisfaction , namely coverage , diversity , novelty or serendipity . Diversity in Recommender Systems , that is , addressing the user’s varied tastes and his / her need for diverse recom - mendations , has been shown to help improve the attractive - ness and usefulness of recommendations [ 14 ] . In this paper we focus on the so - called intra - list distance as deﬁned by Ziegler et al . [ 22 ] , i . e . , how diﬀerent are the items in a rec - ommendation list with respect to each other . In [ 22 ] , Ziegler et al . propose taxonomies of products that are used to deﬁne a similarity metric between items , although other sources of diversity could be considered . For instance , in our previous work [ 19 ] we used movie genres as the source of diversity . On the other hand , Kabutoya et al . [ 12 ] and Shi et al . [ 17 ] extract latent topic models from the users’ interactions with the system in order to create diverse recommendations . The problem of intra - list diversity in Recommender Sys - tems is related to search result diversiﬁcation [ 7 ] . Users of general - purpose commercial search engines tend to submit short queries to represent their information needs . Such brevity in queries tends to lead to ambiguity – the query could have many possible interpretations – and underspeci - ﬁcation , – the topic the query refers to may have diﬀerent facets . A way to cope with this problem is the diversiﬁca - tion of web search results i . e . , presenting lists of documents that cover as many interpretations or facets as possible of the original query as early as possible in the ranking [ 15 ] . The term subtopic is a commonly used word in this area for referring to query interpretations or facets altogether . 2 . 2 Measuring and enhancing diversity Diﬀerent frameworks for measuring and enhancing the di - versity of recommendation lists have been proposed in the Recommender Systems and Information Retrieval literature . We brieﬂy recall here the most closely related and relevant research to the scope of our work . Based on diﬀerent princi - ples , most of them propose re - ranking an initial recommen - dation list so that diverse items can be shown early in the list . The most common approach is based on greedy selec - tion , which tends to achieve a good and eﬃcient approxi - mation to an optimal re - ranking . Methods of this type ﬁt in the algorithmic structure described in Algorithm 1 . The algorithm depends on the speciﬁc deﬁnition of an objective function f obj which deﬁnes the marginal utility of an item with respect to items ranked above it . Algorithm 1 A greedy selection of the items in recommen - dation list R to produce a re - ranked list S . S = ∅ while | R | > 0 do i ∗ = arg max i ∈ R \ S f obj ( i ; S ) R = R \ { i ∗ } S = S ∪ { i ∗ } end while return S One of the earliest and best - known proposals for diversity in Recommender Systems is the “topic list diversiﬁcation” from Ziegler et al . [ 22 ] , to which we will refer as pair - wise framework throughout this paper . This framework deﬁnes a diversity metric called intra - list similarity ( ILS ) , as the sum of similarities between all pairs of items in the recom - mendation : ILS = X i , j ∈ R sim ( i , j ) ( 1 ) where sim is a similarity measure between items . In previ - ous work [ 18 ] , we deﬁned an extension to this metric known as expected intra - list diversity ( EILD ) , which allows to con - sider the relevance and position of the recommended items . Ziegler et al . also proposed a greedy re - ranking strategy to optimize ILS which is structurally equivalent to the max - imal marginal relevance ( MMR ) by Carbonell and Gold - stein [ 5 ] : f MMR ( i ; S ) = ( 1 − λ ) rel ( i ) + λ min j ∈ S dist ( i , j ) ( 2 ) where λ is a trade - oﬀ parameter between the original ranking and the diversity component and rel ( i ) is the relevance of the item i . Zhang and Hurley [ 21 ] also considered the problem of optimizing ILS as a quadratic optimization problem . Another major line of work in measuring and enhancing diversity comes from search result diversiﬁcation . In partic - ular , the intent - aware framework [ 2 ] considers the sum of the weighted marginal relevance of each subtopic s of a query , as it is the case of the intent - aware version of the ERR metric [ 6 ] : ERR − IA = X s p ( s ) | R | X k = 1 1 krel ( i k ) i − 1 Y l = 1 ( 1 − rel ( i l ) ) ( 3 ) where p ( s ) is the probability of s being the intended subtopic behind the query . Santos et al . [ 15 ] proposed the explicit query aspect diversiﬁcation ( xQuAD ) , a re - ranking approach that optimizes intent - aware metrics by enhancing the cover - age of the diﬀerent subtopics while minimizing their redun - dancy : f xQuAD ( i ; S ) = ( 1 − λ ) p ( i ) ( 4 ) + λ X s p ( s ) p ( i | s ) Y j ∈ S ( 1 − p ( j | s ) ) where p ( i | s ) is the probability of choosing item i given the subtopic s . The IA - Select re - ranking approach of Agrawal et al . [ 2 ] , with minor diﬀerences , can be considered as a sub - case of xQuAD with λ = 1 . 0 . This intent - aware framework was adapted to Recommender Systems in [ 19 ] , by translating the concept of query subtopic to user aspects . A third approach is the more recent proportionality framework by Dang and Croft [ 9 ] for search result diversiﬁ - cation . They emphasize the need for covering each subtopic of the search query by oﬀering a number of relevant docu - ments proportional to the interest of the subtopic they cover . The basis for measuring this proportionality is the so - called disproportionality metric , deﬁned as : DP = X s 1 v s ≥ k Rs ( v s − k Rs ) 2 + 1 2 n 2 NR ( 5 ) where v s is the expected number of documents that cover the subtopic s , k Rs the actual number of documents , and n NR the number of non relevant documents . On top of DP , Dang and Croft propose a cumulative proportionality metric ( CPR ) that is the basis of their study . Analogously to the other proposals they deﬁne a greedy re - ranking approach , the proportionality method ( PM ) , inspired on a seat assign - ment system for legislative elections in some countries : f PM ( i ; S ) = λ v s ∗ 1 + 2 P j ∈ S p ( j | s ∗ ) P s ′ p ( j | s ′ ) p ( i | s ∗ ) ( 6 ) + ( 1 − λ ) X s 6 = s ∗ v s 1 + 2 P j ∈ S p ( j | s ) P s ′ p ( j | s ′ ) p ( i | s ) where s ∗ indicates the least - covered subtopic in S . Note that this proportionality framework admits a straightfor - ward adaptation to recommendation similar to that of the intent - aware framework . 3 . CHARACTERIZING GENRES As deﬁned in the Merriam - Webster dictionary 2 , a genre is “a category of artistic , musical , or literary composition characterized by a particular style , form , or content” . We argue that genres can be used as the source for deﬁning diversity as they : • explicitly deﬁne a conventional style of an item that has a common interpretation among users , • have the potential of representing the diﬀerent tastes of individual users , • are well accepted for media categorization and are already available in most online media catalogs for movies , litera - ture , music , etc . • and it is safe to assume that the user will perceive the di - versity of the recommendation list if the genres are diver - siﬁed among the recommended items . Other alternatives such as using item - to - item distance based on consump - tion patterns may have an eﬀect on the inherent diversity of the recommendation , although this may not directly translate to a user perception of diversity . Genres , nonetheless , present some particularities that need to be addressed to be used eﬀectively . First , genres can have diﬀerent levels of generality : for example , in the movie domain “Drama” represents a very broad and vaguely de - ﬁned style with many diverse movies belonging to this genre . On the other hand , “Western” is a quite speciﬁc movie type which is usually devoted to telling stories in the American Wild West . This generality is also reﬂected in the number of items for each genre . See Table 1 for the number of movies in each genre in the Netﬂix data set . We observe that the generality of each genre is also related to the perception of redundancy in a recommendation list . For example , three random westerns in a short recommendation list of ﬁve items feels more redundant than three random dramas . We will ex - ploit this observation when deﬁning our probabilistic model . Genre Count Action 1 , 464 Adult 54 Adventure 996 Animation 381 Biography 384 Comedy 3 , 025 Crime 1 , 319 Documentary 779 Drama 4 , 408 Family 772 Genre Count Fantasy 651 Film - Noir 70 Game - Show 2 History 317 Horror 900 Music 568 Musical 418 Mystery 709 News 1 Reality - TV 15 Genre Count Romance 1 , 887 Sci - Fi 819 Short 237 Sport 284 Talk - Show 2 Thriller 1 , 989 War 422 Western 285 Table 1 : Genre distribution in Netﬂix . Second , genres do not usually deﬁne disjoint or isolated categories in their domains , and it is generally diﬃcult to es - tablish a precise hierarchy among them . For example , “The Lord of the Rings” by Tolkien can be classiﬁed as Adven - ture , Fiction , High fantasy and British literature all at once . Moreover , careless use of sub - genres can lead to lower per - ceived diversity . For example , heavy metal and white metal – two closely related sub - genres – share the same musical techniques , modes of dress and performance and could be perceived as similar by a listener . In order to illustrate the aforementioned properties of gen - res , we present the case of movie recommendations of the Netﬂix dataset . This dataset contains one hundred million ratings ( from 1 to 5 stars ) from 480 , 000 to 17 , 770 diﬀerent movies . Using IMDb 3 , we found genre information for 9 , 320 movies in the dataset accounting for 83 % of the ratings in the dataset . 2 http : / / www . merriam - webster . com 3 http : / / www . imdb . com / As seen in Table 1 the number of movies for each genre varies greatly , from 4 , 408 movies in“Drama”to only 1 movie in“News” . Genres do not form disjoint categories , as seen in Figure 1 , which shows the overlap between the top 5 genres by a Venn diagram . One can see that , for instance , there are only 76 pure “Romance” movies , and the other 96 % of movies in this genre overlap with at least one other genre . Other genres also have a high degree of overlap . In fact , there is no clear hierarchical structure between the genres . It also seems that overlaps between genres do not follow any particular distribution . Furthermore , pairwise overlaps be - tween genres are not wide enough as to establish any clear sub - genre relationship between one another ; even the nar - rowest and most speciﬁc genres ( for example , Crime ) have only partial overlaps ( < 60 % ) with more general genres such as Drama . 1622 1223 303 463 76 20 624 584 488 478 157 196 317 68 36 16 49 104 42 379 29 34 219 59 20 7 25 7 12 18 2 Drama ( 4408 ) Comedy ( 3025 ) Action ( 1464 ) Thriller ( 1989 ) Romance ( 1887 ) Figure 1 : Venn diagram for the 5 most frequent gen - res in the Netﬂix dataset . 4 . MEASURING GENRE DIVERSITY IN RECOMMENDATION LISTS We all have an intuitive idea of what genre diversity means for a list of movies . Yet when it comes to translating the intuition to a mathematical expression that reﬂects degrees of diversity by a numeric value , one has to be more speciﬁc about what the value should reﬂect . In particular , drawing from the IR diversity literature [ 2 , 5 , 20 ] , two diﬀerent di - mensions should be considered to this respect , namely genre coverage and redundancy . We take them as required prop - erties that a genre - based recommendation diversity metric should capture . Furthermore , we argue that these dimen - sions should be captured in a way that takes into account the properties of genres discussed and exempliﬁed in Section 3 . Moreover , we add to these a third and new requirement , size - awareness , which has not been explicitly considered in prior work . We brieﬂy discuss each of these three properties next . Coverage is the simplest and most obvious property . Since most users enjoy items from a variety of genres , it is impor - tant that the recommendation list covers as many of them as possible . Moreover , this coverage should be proportional : even when a user is interested in several genres , the person - alized importance of each genre is not equal . Therefore , the more a user is interested in a given genre , the more impor - tant it is that it is covered in the recommendation list . Second , redundancy should also be considered . It is not enough to have a high coverage of genres in order to have a diverse recommendation list . We may put it this way : it is as important to present items that cover a certain genre as to present other items that do not cover it . This notion of redundancy should take into account the preferences for the user as well as how general each genre is . Consider the extreme example shown in Table 2 where three movies are recommended to a user . Even if these 3 movies cover a total of 6 genres , the diversity is not quite perceivable . This is because all three movies cover a very narrow Western genre which makes the recommendation list highly redundant . Finally , size - awareness . Coverage and redundancy should depend on the length of the recommendation list . Since the rise of mobile devices , the issue of having limited screen real estate to show recommendations requires a careful selection of what to display in that list . We also improve over existing diversity enhancing techniques by speciﬁcally addressing the recommendation list size . For example , when generating a short recommendation list one should only recommend items from the most relevant genres . In a longer list we could have higher genre redundancy depending on the generality of the involved genres . To the best of our knowledge this kind of adaptation has not been explored in prior work on search or recommendation diversity . The reviewed techniques in Section 2 . 2 do not satisfy all these properties , in particular : • The intra - list similarity of Ziegler et al . [ 22 ] is deﬁned as a pairwise property of elements in a list . A pair - wise property does not translate however as directly as we may expect to a list - wise property as we are stating . Further , it is not trivial to consider a similarity measure that takes into account by itself the generality of diﬀerent genres and the user - speciﬁc importance of each of them . Essentially equivalent to the approach by Ziegler et al , the MMR scheme [ 5 ] displays the same limitations . • The intent - aware framework ( IA - metrics , IA - select and xQuAD ) [ 2 , 15 ] considers coverage and redundancy , but as to the latter , the scheme does not fully capture the view that it is equally important to present items that cover a certain genre as to present other items that do not cover it . Speciﬁcally , the redundancy component of ERR - IA and xQuAD reduces the contribution of items that cover redundant genres , rather than discounting them as neg - ative from the list diversity value . Thus , items covering a redundant genre will contribute positively to the diver - sity even though the contribution diminishes with each additional occurrence of the genre . Furthermore , this re - dundancy does not detract at all from the contribution of additional genres the items can have in addition to the redundant one – that is , the genres are assumed to be totally independent from each other . The example in Ta - ble 2 illustrates this eﬀect : it is ﬁne ( diversity - wise ) in the context of this framework that all the movies in the recommendation list be westerns , as long as they cover also other genres . As a consequence , the diversiﬁcations are biased to retrieve items that cover many genres . We may reasonably question the implicit assumption in this scheme that multiple genres in the same item will pro - cure the same diversity perception as multiple genres over diﬀerent items . • The work by Dang and Croft [ 9 ] does cover an idea of user - centric proportionality , but redundancy is not penalized and therefore , it may also suﬀer from the same problems as xQuAD for genre diversity . • None of the prior search or recommendation diversiﬁca - tion methods takes into account the size of the retrieved list that will be presented to ( or browsed by ) the user . The diversiﬁcation schemes have therefore no means to consider this information to enhance diversity at a partic - ular rank cutoﬀ .

A BINOMIAL FRAMEWORK FOR GENRE DIVERSITY A na¨ıve approach for creating diverse recommendations consists in making a random selection of items . This ap - proach oﬀers highly diverse recommendations , but it tends to approximate the poorest possible output in terms of the relevance of recommendations for the user interests , which makes it an option of little practical use . Still , the nature of the selection of genres in a random recommendation pro - vides a meaningful basis to build a revised notion of diver - sity upon it . In particular , we propose to use a binomial distribution to model how a personalized recommendation would match a random recommendation in terms of the di - versity of genres , using the binomial distribution to model the likelihood that a given genre will appear by chance in a recommendation , and take this as a reference to assess the diversity value of a given genre distribution among recom - mended items . In essence , this approach means considering random item recommendation as the optimal approach in terms of pure genre diversity , and using a binomial distribu - tion as the model for the genre distribution resulting from random item sampling . 5 . 1 The Binomial Diversity Metric The binomial distribution is the discrete probability dis - tribution of the number k of successes in a sequence of N independent Bernoulli trials with the same probability of success p . A random variable that follows this distribution , X ∼ B ( N , p ) , has the following probability mass function : P ( X = k ) = N k ! p k ( 1 − p ) N − k ( 7 ) We base our deﬁnition of a genre diversity metric on top of this as follows . For each genre , we measure its coverage and redundancy using binomial distributions . We consider the selection of an item covering each genre as a Bernoulli trial , whereby for each genre , a recommendation list can be viewed as a sequence of Bernoulli trials . It must be noticed that these trials are not independent : a recommendation list is actually a selection without replacement . However , given that the typical recommendation list size is usually much smaller than the set of movies covering each genre , we can treat these trials as if they were independent , and therefore use the binomial distribution to model how likely is a genre to appear in a recommendation list . More formally , for an item i and a set of genres G ( i ) covered by the item i , we consider the Bernoulli experi - ment of whether a randomly sampled genre g belongs to G ( i ) . Given a set of items S , we denote the number of items belonging to that genre – the number of successes – as k S g = | { i ∈ S : g ∈ G ( i ) } | . Given a recommendation list R of size N , we take the probability of a genre p g as a mea - sure of how “adequate” is the number k Rg of items covering a genre g in that recommendation . As required in Section 4 , this probability should take into account the generality of a genre and also the relevance of each genre for the user .

Each of the four postulates shows two rankings ( displayed horizontally ) with better or worse diversity . Each item in the ranking is represented by the genres ( a , b , c ) that it belongs to . We show in the table the diversity score that each of the metric assigns to the lists . In the computation of the metric values , we assume for simplicity there are only three genres in the dataset , with prior probabilities , as an example , p ( a ) = 0 . 5 , p ( b ) = 0 . 25 , p ( c ) = 0 . 25 . For ERR - IA we use the same deﬁnition as in the TREC diversity task ( as computed by the ndeval script ) , generalized to support non - uniform aspect distributions . propose to combine global genre distribution statistics and personalized user preferences to estimate p g as follows . On one side , the relevance of a genre for the user u can be estimated by using historical data , i . e . , considering the local proportion p ′′ g of the items the user has had some interaction with , denoted as I u . On the other side , the generality of the genre can be estimated by the global proportion p ′ g of items in the user preferences covering it . To join both global and local probabilities , we propose a simple linear combination : p ′′ g = k I u g | I u | p ′ g = P u k I u g P u | I u | p g = ( 1 − α ) p ′ g + α p ′′ g ( 8 ) With all the components of genre - based binomial distribu - tions , we now deﬁne scores for the coverage and redundancy of a recommendation list R . We measure coverage as a prop - erty deﬁned by the genres that are present in the recommen - dation list and those that are not . The maximum coverage would be achieved when all the genres of interest are covered in the recommendation list . However , this maximum is not always reachable , especially in small recommendation lists . Therefore , when some genres cannot be covered , the cover - age should reﬂect the loss caused by their absence , which should be proportional to their importance . We thus deﬁne the coverage score as the product for the genres not repre - sented in the recommendation list of their probabilities of not being randomly selected according to X g , normalized by the | G | - th root : Coverage ( R ) = Y g / ∈ G ( R ) P ( X g = 0 ) 1 / | G | ( 9 ) We deﬁne redundancy , in turn , only by the genres covered in the recommendation list . The moment one genre appears more than once in a recommendation list , it can be poten - tially redundant , although not all genres will be equally af - fected . We model the redundancy of a genre appearing k times in a recommendation list by a “remaining tolerance” score that reﬂects how probable it would be that the genre appeared at least k times in a random list : P ( X g ≥ k | X g > 0 ) = 1 − k − 1 X l = 1 P ( X g = l | X g > 0 ) ( 10 ) Some examples of this “remaining tolerance” score are il - lustrated in Figure 2 . The non - redundancy score is conse - quently deﬁned as the product of the “remaining tolerance” scores for each covered genre , normalized by the | G ( R ) | - th root : NonRed ( R ) = Y g ∈ G ( R ) P ( X g ≥ k Rg | X g > 0 ) 1 / | G ( R ) | ( 11 ) Finally , the Binomial Diversity metric is deﬁned as the product of both components : BinomDiv ( R ) = Coverage ( R ) · NonRed ( R ) ( 12 ) The previous deﬁnition can be adapted to consider only the relevant recommended items by re - deﬁning k Rg as the num - ber of relevant items covering the genre g and the number of trials N as the number of relevant recommended items . Note that binomial relevance satisﬁes all the properties de - scribed in Section 4 . It maximizes the coverage of the genres according to their p g .

In our experiments we do so by transforming them to z - scores , that is , we subtract their mean and divide by the standard devi - ation : norm X ( x ) = x − µ X σ X . 5 . 3 Qualitative analysis In addition to the empirical behavior of the proposed scheme , the Binomial Diversity metric fulﬁlls qualitative properties that further specify the requirements stated ear - lier in Section 4 . These properties can be formalized by four postulates shown in Table 3 , which we propose as a basis on which diversiﬁcation metrics can be analyzed and compared to each other , providing a clear way to show properties of each metric , identify and report the diﬀerences , in a similar perspective as proposed in [ 3 ] . Each postulate presents a rule , which expresses a simple idea on how we can reason about the genre - based diversity . We represent each of the postulates by providing two ranked lists of items ( displayed horizontally in the table ) with minimal diﬀerences . The ranked list denoted by “Better” should have strictly higher diversity that the one denoted by“Worse” . For example , the ﬁrst postulate expresses the idea that a ranked list of two items that cover two genres ( a and b ) is more diverse than a list of two items that cover only one genre ( a ) . We mark a method with “Yes” only if the metric complies with the postulate , otherwise we indicate to what extent the metric fails to satisfy the postulated inequality ( either the metric yields the opposite inequality , or is insensitive to the diﬀer - ence between the two lists ) . We can see that all of the state of the art methods fail at least one of the tests , and only our proposed Binomial Diversity that combines Coverage and NonRed properties complies with all the postulates . For illustration , we show in the same table the diversity score that each of the analyzed diversiﬁcation metric assigns to the prototypical lists . In order to further illustrate how the diversiﬁcation metric works and to show the beneﬁts of the genre - based approach , we may examine the working example shown in Table 4 . The example shows the top 20 recommended movies by the item - based kNN method ( R 0 ∪ R 1 ) for a sample user from the Netﬂix dataset , and the re - ranking of this list by the bino - mial diversiﬁcation ( R 0 ∪ R 2 ) , shown by the movies that are removed ( R 1 ) and added ( R 2 ) as a result of the re - ranking . The ﬁrst row of the table summarizes the user taste proﬁle ( p ′′ g ) , i . e . what fraction of movies of each genre he has rated . We see that the user is inclined towards Drama , Comedy and Action movies . We may also notice that the user sel - dom watched War movies . Both recommendation lists have an overlap of 11 movies ( R 0 ) that are shown below the user proﬁle information . If we compare the diﬀerences between both recommendation lists – the kNN baseline R 0 ∪ R 1 and its diversiﬁcation by the binomial scheme R 0 ∪ R 2 , we see that the baseline promotes Action and War movies that are over - represented in the ﬁnal list of 20 movies , thus creat - ing a highly redundant recommendation . The recommender under - represents other genres such as Comedy which plays a major part in the user proﬁle . The binomial diversiﬁca - tion , on the other hand , uses the p ′′ g and the list size as the reference for how many movies of each genre it should select to avoid redundancy . There are already 7 Action movies in the list and , therefore , it promotes several Comedies in - stead . Moreover , it includes new genres such as Animation , Children’s and Mystery that help improve the coverage score . This leads to a signiﬁcant increase of the diversiﬁcation score for the diversiﬁed list . 6 . EXPERIMENTS In order to show the properties of the Binomial Diver - sity framework , we have carried out two experiments on two common datasets for movie recommendation : the Movie - Lens1M 4 collection and the data from the Netﬂix Prize .

Discarding the movies for which we could not ﬁnd genres , the resulting dataset includes 83 million ratings ( on a 1 - 5 scale ) by 480 , 000 users for 9 , 320 movies classiﬁed into 28 diﬀerent genres . Due to the similarities between the re - sults for both datasets and the space limit , we only report and discuss the results for the Netﬂix dataset . 6 . 1 Setup We split the rating data into training and test in a 5 - fold cross validation . We followed a common evaluation proce - dure [ 4 , 8 ] in which for each target user the recommenders are required to rank a list which includes both relevant and non - relevant items . The relevant items include all those hav - ing a test rating for the target user , where the rating value is above a threshold . In the set of irrelevant items we include all movies with a test rating value below the threshold , plus a set of 1000 randomly sampled movies . We take for our experiment two baseline collaborative ﬁl - tering ( CF ) algorithms : an item - based nearest neighbors rec - ommender [ 16 ] ( Item - kNN ) and the implicit Matrix Factor - ization algorithm ( iMF ) by Hu et al . [ 11 ] . We additionally include two non - personalized systems for further reference : recommendation by item popularity ( PopRec ) and random recommendation ( Random ) . On each of the CF baselines , we applied the diversiﬁcation approaches described in Sec - tion 2 . 2 ( MMR , PM and xQuAD ) and our Binomial diver - siﬁcation . The optimal value of the λ parameter in these diversiﬁers is set by a grid search in the [ 0 , 1 ] interval by steps of 0 . 1 . We additionally report as a reference the ef - fects of random re - ranking . We evaluate the diversity of the recommendations with respect to genres by our proposed Binomial Diversity met - ric ( BinomDiv ) , plus the diversity metrics presented in Sec - tion 2 . 2 : EILD , ERR - IA and CPR .

For diversiﬁcations , the parameter chosen ( in parenthesis ) is the one that achieves the best result with respect to its relevance - aware objective metric . Bold indicates the best result for a given baseline and metric . Italics indicate non statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences to the corresponding baseline ( Wilcoxon p < 0 . 05 ) . tional simple diversity metrics : subtopic recall [ 20 ] ( S - recall ) , which is the total number of returned genres ( as a ratio on the total number of genres in the collection ) in a recom - mendation ; and the average number of subtopics ( genres ) per item ( SPI ) , which will serve as a reference to study the bias discussed in Section 4 for the intent - aware framework . We consider two variants for the BinomDiv , EILD , CPR and S - recall metrics : one , denoted as all , where the genres of all recommended items are taken into account to mea - sure the diversity of the list , and another , denoted as rel , in which only those items relevant to the user are taken into ac - count . Complementarily to the diversity metrics , we report the normalized discount cumulative gain ( nDCG ) to check the relevance - based eﬀectiveness ( regardless of diversity ) of all conﬁgurations . 6 . 2 Results for Baseline Diversity Table 5 shows the results for all the recommender base - lines without any diversiﬁcation step . All the metrics are evaluated at a 20 ranking cut - oﬀ . The algorithms are sorted by their nDCG score . We omit in this table the rel variants since they strongly correlate with nDCG when comparing recommendation algorithms with very diﬀerent levels of ac - curacy , and thus they are not informative . For the metrics BinomDiv and CPR we show three alternatives ( see Equa - tion 8 ) : global or non - personalized ( α = 0 . 0 ) , intermediate ( α = 0 . 5 ) and fully personalized ( α = 1 . 0 ) . As we can see , the random recommender , as expected , has a very low accuracy , but scores very high for all diver - sity metrics , especially the non - personalized ones ( BinomDiv and CPR with α = 0 . 0 , EILD and S - recall ) . The popularity - based recommendation has a much higher accuracy than the random recommendations , but has generally lower scores for diversity metrics , specially in BinomDiv , where it is in gen - eral the worst alternative . The personalized recommenders , which have a higher accuracy than the non - personalized rec - ommenders , tend to score low in terms of non - personalized diversity metrics ( BinomDiv and CPR with α = 0 . 0 , EILD and S - recall ) , but clearly improve in BinomDiv and CPR when the user history is considered ( α > 0 . 0 ) . The results from Table 5 show consistent results , show - ing that random recommendations are diverse in nature , and personalized recommendations may beneﬁt from a re - ranking diversiﬁcation step . 6 . 3 Results for Diversiﬁed Results We present in Table 6 the results of diversifying the iMF recommendation baseline . Diversiﬁcations of the other per - sonalized recommendation ( Item - kNN ) were also carried out with similar outcomes , but we omit them because of the space limit . All the metrics are computed again at a 20 ranking cut - oﬀ . The α parameter in BinomDiv ( metric and diversiﬁer ) and CPR is set to 0 . 5 . As mentioned before , the λ parameter value ( shown in parenthesis ) for the bino - mial , PM , MMR and xQuAD diversiﬁcations is the one that maximizes the corresponding objective metric : BinomDiv - rel , CPR - rel , EILD - rel and ERR - IA , respectively . A ﬁrst overall trend we may observe is that , in terms of nDCG , all the diversiﬁcations involve a decrease in the ac - curacy of the recommendations , showing an also expectable trade - oﬀ between relevance and diversity . Second , each di - versiﬁer is always the best option with respect to its target metric , with the exception of PM , which is outperformed by BinomDiv in CPR - all and by xQuAD in CPR - rel . This can be explained because PM does not optimize directly the formulation of CPR ( see Equations 5 and 7 ) , while the rest of the diversiﬁers optimize directly their target met - ric . Third , for CPR - rel the improvements over the baseline are almost imperceptible , and restricted to xQuAD . This shows that a diversiﬁcation algorithm ( and the metric it is intended to target ) devised for a search task may not get the expected results in a recommendation setting with a diﬀer - ent subtopic - document ( in our case , genre - item ) distribution patterns , which is one of the motivations for our framework . As to the intent - aware framework – the xQuAD diversiﬁer and the ERR - IA metric – and the proportionality framework – the PM diversiﬁer and the CPR metric – , the results evi - dence one of the problems pointed out in Section 4 , namely the accumulation of genres without any penalization for re - dundancy . The SPI values show how the xQuAD and PM strategies notably increase the average number of genres per item in the diversiﬁed recommendations , which , as discussed in Section 4 , does not necessarily ﬁt well with an eﬀective notion of diversity in recommendation . Regarding the met - rics , ERR - IA and CPR - rel show a clear correlation with SPI , a bias that narrows the informativeness of this metric in a recommendation setting .

Bold indicates the best diversiﬁcation cut - oﬀ for a each metric cut - oﬀ in each dataset . Another key observation in the diversity - speciﬁc analysis concerns the relation between the frameworks . To facilitate the analysis of the results of Table 6 , we show in Figure 3 the relative improvements over the baseline . The cross - wise rela - tionships between diversiﬁcations and metrics from diﬀerent frameworks show interesting ﬁndings . Overall , we can see in the ﬁgure that the binomial diversiﬁer improves over the baseline when measured with BinomDiv , CPR - all and EILD , showing that the binomial framework is able to promote the proportionality of CPR - all and the dissimilarity of items of EILD by improving the coverage and non - redundancy of the recommendations . In turn , the proportionality of PM does not seem suﬃcient to promote the diversity when measured with BinomDiv , while the dissimilarity of MMR improves the coverage and non - redundancy of BinomDiv . The intent - aware framework shows some relation with the proportional - ity framework , most probably caused by the aforementioned accumulation of genres without penalization of redundancy , and does not oﬀer improvements in the other frameworks . All these observations support our postulation that the bi - nomial framework is able to capture and procure coverage while avoiding redundancy , uncovering a diversity angle be - yond what the other frameworks can capture . Finally , in order to evaluate the size - awareness of our Bi - nomial framework , Table 7 shows the correspondence , using the iMF baseline , between the cut - oﬀ of the binomial diver - siﬁcation algorithm ( the N in 13 ) and the cut - oﬀ of the bi - nomial diversity metric . For each diversiﬁcation cut - oﬀ , the results correspond to the best λ of the objective function . As expected , the best diversiﬁcation cut - oﬀ always agrees with the cut - oﬀ of the diversity metric , in both all and rel variants . This shows that our approach is able to leverage knowledge of the desired result set size in order to bring an additional made - to - ﬁt improvement at the targeted cut - oﬀ , a feature that is not supported in any prior framework . 7 . CONCLUSIONS We tackle in this paper the problem of diversity using genre information in Recommender Systems . An analysis of the properties of genres helps us deﬁne the requirements that a genre - based deﬁnition of diversity in recommenda - tion should satisfy , namely coverage , non - redundancy and recommendation list size - awareness . We propose a binomial framework that satisﬁes these properties . A metric is de - ﬁned upon this framework , and a greedy re - ranking algo - rithm that optimizes it . Experiments on two movie recom - mendation datasets validate the consistency of our frame - work , illustrate its properties , and show they comply with the stated requirements . As future work , we will extend our experiments to other datasets , such as music and books , and carry out user studies to further analyze and contrast the behavior and properties of the proposed framework . 8 .
