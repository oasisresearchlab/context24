Lim ∗ brianlim @ comp . nus . edu . sg National University of Singapore Singapore ABSTRACT AI - driven Action Quality Assessment ( AQA ) of sports videos can mimic Olympic judges to help score performances as a second opin - ion or for training . However , these AI methods are uninterpretable and do not justify their scores , which is important for algorithmic accountability . Indeed , to account for their decisions , instead of scoring subjectively , sports judges use a consistent set of criteria — rubric — on multiple actions in each performance sequence . There - fore , we propose IRIS to perform Interpretable Rubric - Informed Segmentation on action sequences for AQA . We investigated IRIS for scoring videos of figure skating performance . IRIS predicts ( 1 ) action segments , ( 2 ) technical element score differences of each seg - ment relative to base scores , ( 3 ) multiple program component scores , and ( 4 ) the summed final score . In a modeling study , we found that IRIS performs better than non - interpretable , state - of - the - art mod - els . In a formative user study , practicing figure skaters agreed with the rubric - informed explanations , found them useful , and trusted AI judgments more . This work highlights the importance of using judgment rubrics to account for AI decisions .

This is especially im - portant where judgements are performed automatically . One such area is sports analytics or action quality assessment ( AQA ) , where many AI - based computer vision techniques have been developed to assess the quality of performances from videos [ 5 , 18 , 19 , 26 – 28 , 34 , 42 , 43 , 45 ] . This can mimic Olympic judges to help score performances as a second opinion , help spectators understand how certain sports are judged , and help athletes get access to cheaper and faster feedback . However , these techniques mostly predict scores and do not provide more information on how the scores were derived . They are inscrutable and uninterpretable . There are some prior work to explain predictions in AQA . For example , Yu et al . explained scoring diving performances [ 44 ] us - ing Grad - CAM saliency maps [ 33 ] . Although saliency maps can be useful in some applications [ 1 ] , these explanations were originally designed for model debugging , and are overly technical and unlikely to be usable by practicing athletes . One way to increase relevance is to make the explanations concept - based [ 16 , 17 ] or more relat - able [ 47 ] , but these may be too simplistic and generic for skilled activities . Several researchers have argued that AI explanations should be tailored to end users and relevant contexts [ 20 , 22 , 40 ] . Wang and Yin identified several important desiderata of XAI for non - experts [ 41 ] and Dodge et al . demonstrated the benefit of XAI on fairness decisions [ 10 ] , but there has been limited work on pro - viding XAI to domain experts [ 21 , 23 ] . Pirsiavash et al . developed diving feedback proposals by calculating gradients of scores relative to pose estimation joints [ 29 ] , but is only data - driven , rather than driven by how athletes or judges make decisions . Instead , we argue that XAI developers should study the scoring rubrics used in the application domain to identify requirements for justifications . Indeed , to account for their decisions , instead of scoring subjectively , sports judges use a consistent set of criteria — rubric — on multiple actions in each performance sequence . For example , in figure skating , judges refer to a score sheet that is standardized by the ISU Judging System [ 37 , 38 ] to include multiple criteria and methods for scoring . It is important for the AI to adhere to these rubrics to be as accountable as human judges . See Fig . 1 for conceptual overview , and Fig . 3 for demo . Towards this end , we propose IRIS , an I nterpretable R ubric - I nformed S egmentation method to predict and explain video - based action quality assessment ( AQA ) . It is interpretable to explain how it derived its judgement score . It is informed by a rubric to deter - mine what to consider when calculating its judgement . It performs a r X i v : 2303 . 09097v1 [ c s .

We propose rubric - informed explainable AI ( XAI ) judges to use rubrics from domain experts to judge with accountability . segmentation to locate specific sections of a performance to judge specific criteria . We implemented this for the application domain of figure skating , but the high - level approach is generalizable to other video - based AQA ( e . g . , diving , dancing , cooking ) with prede - fined criteria rubrics . IRIS provides four key features to predict and explain its judgement : Score , Sequence , Segments , and Subscores . Being rubric - informed , IRIS is more accurate to predict scores due to rule guidance , and is more accountable to justify its decisions based on domain - established criteria . We evaluated IRIS in multiple studies : 1 ) a demonstration study of the interpretability of IRIS with a visualization of ice skating , 2 ) a quantitative modeling study to compare IRIS against the base - line models , and 3 ) a formative user study with experienced figure skaters to qualitatively investigate the usefulness and trustworthi - ness of various rubric - informed features in IRIS . In summary , our contributions are : • The introduction of a rubric - informed approach to identify inter - pretability requirements for AI based on scoring rubrics . • The development of IRIS , an interpretable deep learning model that is more useful , understandable , and trustworthy than other state - of - the - art models for action quality assessment . • An evaluation of rubric - informed interpretability for figure skat - ing with domain experts in a formative study . 2 RELATED WORK We summarize related works on predicting and explaining AQA . 2 . 1 Action Quality Assessment ( AQA ) Many AI - driven action quality assessment ( AQA ) systems have been proposed for sports [ 5 , 18 , 19 , 26 – 28 , 34 , 42 , 43 , 45 ] and other fields [ 11 , 12 , 46 ] . AI - based AQA extracts video features trains a regression model to predict scores . The feature extraction methods generally use three - dimensional convolutional neural networks ( 3DCNN ) , such as C3D [ 36 ] and I3D [ 7 ] . These networks convert short segments of video into feature vectors by convolving in both 2D spatial and 1D temporal dimensions . To handle longer videos with longer - term behaviors , Parmar et al . combined the 3DCNN with recurrent LSTM to propose C3D - LSTM [ 28 ] . Zheng et al . devel - oped a hybrid approach of video and image features and proposed a context - aware AQA based on a Graph Convolutional Network ( GCN ) [ 45 ] . They modeled static posture and dynamic movement to capture the short and long - term temporal relationships . Nekoui et al . [ 26 ] proposed a CNN - based approach that captures both fine and coarse - grained temporal dependencies . Using both video fea - tures and pose estimation heatmaps [ 25 ] , they stacked CNN - based modules of various kernel sizes to capture patterns at different time resolutions . For figure skating AQA , Xu et al . [ 42 ] proposed a multi - scale and skip - connected CNN - LSTM method to capture short - term time dependencies with variously - sized CNN kernels , and LSTM with self - attention for longer - term time dependencies . 2 . 2 Explaining Action Quality Assessment While the aforementioned research on AQA focused on high pre - diction performance ( e . g . , Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between AI and human judges ) , they neglected how users would use and interpret the score predictions . Explainable AI ( XAI ) tech - niques could help . They are widely used in prediction tasks , such as computer vision [ 1 , 2 , 33 ] , and natural language [ 8 , 24 , 30 , 31 ] . For example , Yu et al . explained the scoring of diving performances [ 44 ] using Grad - CAM saliency maps [ 33 ] . Unfortunately , these expla - nations were primarily designed for model debugging , are overly technical , and unlikely to be usable by practicing athletes . It re - mains unclear how practicing athletes , not data scientists , would use and understand the AI - based AQA systems . Therefore , it is important to study how we can show or explain the AQA results to practitioners . Pirsiavash et al . developed feedback for the sport of diving by calculating the gradients of scores relative to pose estimation joints [ 29 ] . This is highly relevant to the diving activity , but is only data - driven , rather than driven by how athletes or judges make de - cisions . Instead , we argue that XAI for AQA in sports should adhere to the rubrics that are used in the sport , which is our approach with IRIS . Khan et al . [ 15 ] developed a method for analyzing batting in cricket using wearable sensors and further proposed a visualization inspired by TV shows of cricket games . They classified various low - level sub - actions identified from careful analysis of how play - ers move when playing cricket . Thompson et al . [ 35 ] proposed a visualization for dressage ( horse riding ) , where they quantified scoring criteria inspired from score cards in the sport . We drew our rubrics from score cards in the sport of figure skating . Both aforementioned methods used locomotion data of IMU sensors , and implemented heuristically or with shallow machine learning models ( e . g . , SVM , kNN , decision tree ) . With IRIS , we imbued a deep learning meta - architecture with rubric - informed features to be generalizable and can apply to the more ubiquitous video data . 3 BACKGROUND : RUBRIC FOR FIGURE SKATING ACTION QUALITY ASSESSMENT In this section , we describe how rubrics are critical for formal and accountable judgement of many performances , our application use case of figure skating and its judging rubric . This background guides the subsequent design of our proposed explainable system . 3 . 1 Rubrics In many situations where judgements affect many people’s lives , scoring rubrics have been developed to formalize how performance IRIS : Interpretable Rubric - Informed Segmentation for Action Quality Assessment IUI 2023 , Mar 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , Australia LADIES SHORT PROGRAM JUDGES DETAILS PER SKATER ISU European Championships 2014 Rank Name Total Deductions Nation Total Segment Score Total Element Score Total Program Component Score ( factored ) Starting Number 26 . 76 53 . 02 GER Nathalie WEINZIERL # Executed Elements Base Value GOE Scores of Panel 1 4 . 10 - 1 . 90 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 3 - 3 Ref 2 . 20 10 The Judges Panel ( in random order ) 26 . 26 3T + COMBO I n f o 34 0 . 00 6 . 50 0 . 50 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 6 . 00 2 3Lz 3 . 34 0 . 64 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 . 70 3 LSp4 x 3 . 63 0 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 1 0 0 . 00 3 . 63 4 2A 5 3 . 00 0 . 29 1 3 . 29 1 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 FSSp4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 . 80 1 0 . 50 3 . 30 6 StSq3 3 . 50 0 . 50 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 4 . 00 CCoSp4 26 . 23 Program Components Skating Skills 6 . 50 7 . 00 6 . 75 6 . 75 6 . 50 6 . 50 7 . 25 6 . 50 7 . 25 Factor 0 . 80 6 . 75 26 . 76 Transition / Linking Footwork 0 . 80 6 . 25 6 . 50 6 . 00 6 . 50 6 . 00 6 . 00 6 . 75 6 . 25 6 . 75 6 . 32 Performance / Execution 0 . 80 6 . 50 6 . 00 6 . 50 6 . 50 6 . 25 6 . 50 7 . 25 6 . 75 7 . 00 6 . 57 Choreography / Composition 6 . 75 6 . 75 6 . 00 6 . 75 6 . 25 6 . 00 6 . 75 6 . 50 6 . 75 0 . 80 6 . 54 Interpretation 6 . 50 6 . 75 7 . 00 6 . 75 6 . 00 6 . 25 6 . 75 6 . 50 7 . 00 0 . 80 6 . 64 Judges Total Program Component Score ( factored ) 26 . 26 Deductions : 0 . 00 x Credit for highlight distribution , base value multiplied by 1 . 1 Rank Name Total Deductions Nation Total Segment Score Total Element Score Total Program Component Score ( factored ) Starting Number 26 . 49 52 . 55 SWE Viktoria HELGESSON # Executed Elements Base Value GOE Scores of Panel 1 4 . 10 - 1 . 30 - 3 - 2 0 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 1 Ref 2 . 80 11 The Judges Panel ( in random order ) 26 . 06 3T I n f o 27 0 . 00 6 . 60 0 . 20 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 . 40 2 3Lo + 2T 2 . 90 0 . 50 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 1 0 2 . 40 3 LSp3 x 4 . 34 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 0 . 71 3 . 63 4 2A 5 2 . 30 - 0 . 51 - 2 1 . 79 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 1 - 1 FSSp2 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 2 - 1 3 . 46 0 - 0 . 04 3 . 50 6 CCoSp4 3 . 90 0 . 70 1 1 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 7 4 . 60 StSq4 26 . 23 Program Components Skating Skills 6 . 25 7 . 00 7 . 25 6 . 50 6 . 50 6 . 75 6 . 75 6 . 75 6 . 75 Factor 0 . 80 6 . 71 26 . 49 Transition / Linking Footwork 0 . 80 6 . 00 6 . 50 7 . 00 6 . 25 6 . 00 6 . 00 6 . 25 6 . 50 6 . 25 6 . 25 Performance / Execution 0 . 80 6 . 50 6 . 75 7 . 25 6 . 25 6 . 00 6 . 50 6 . 50 6 . 75 7 . 00 6 . 61 Choreography / Composition 6 . 00 6 . 50 7 . 00 6 . 50 6 . 00 6 . 50 6 . 50 6 . 50 6 . 50 0 . 80 6 . 43 Interpretation 6 . 50 6 . 50 7 . 50 6 . 25 6 . 25 6 . 00 6 . 75 6 . 75 7 . 00 0 . 80 6 . 57 Judges Total Program Component Score ( factored ) 26 . 06 Deductions : 0 . 00 x Credit for highlight distribution , base value multiplied by 1 . 1 Rank Name Total Deductions Nation Total Segment Score Total Element Score Total Program Component Score ( factored ) Starting Number 28 . 39 50 . 42 FIN Juulia TURKKILA # Executed Elements Base Value GOE Scores of Panel 1 8 . 20 0 . 90 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 Ref 9 . 10 12 The Judges Panel ( in random order ) 22 . 03 3T + 3T I n f o 16 0 . 00 2 . 70 - 1 . 50 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 2 - 3 4 . 20 2 3S 2 . 76 - 0 . 04 0 0 0 0 - 1 - 1 0 0 0 2 . 80 3 FCSp3 x 3 . 63 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 00 3 . 63 4 2A 5 3 . 00 0 . 43 1 3 . 43 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 CCoSp3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 . 80 1 0 . 50 3 . 30 6 StSq3 2 . 40 0 . 57 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 7 2 . 97 LSp3 27 . 53 Program Components Skating Skills 5 . 50 5 . 25 5 . 75 5 . 75 5 . 00 6 . 00 5 . 50 6 . 00 6 . 00 Factor 0 . 80 5 . 68 28 . 39 Transition / Linking Footwork 0 . 80 5 . 00 5 . 00 5 . 25 5 . 50 4 . 50 5 . 50 5 . 25 5 . 25 5 . 50 5 . 25 Performance / Execution 0 . 80 5 . 25 5 . 00 5 . 50 5 . 75 5 . 00 6 . 00 5 . 50 6 . 00 5 . 75 5 . 54 Choreography / Composition 5 . 25 4 . 75 5 . 50 6 . 25 4 . 75 6 . 00 5 . 75 5 . 50 5 . 75 0 . 80 5 . 50 Interpretation 5 . 50 4 . 75 5 . 75 6 . 00 4 . 75 5 . 75 5 . 75 5 . 75 5 . 75 0 . 80 5 . 57 Judges Total Program Component Score ( factored ) 22 . 03 Deductions : 0 . 00 x Credit for highlight distribution , base value multiplied by 1 . 1 Table 1 : Example score sheet showing the total score , TES , PCS , executed elements ( actions that the figure skater performed ) , base values ( difficulty scores for each action ) , and PCS components . Judges use the score sheet to guide their judging . Figure skaters and spectators see the score sheets to understand the result of contests . is judged . This is especially used in education to evaluate qualitative assessments , such as essays and presentations [ 9 ] , and in subjective sports [ 6 ] . Rubrics can help judges focus on specific aspects for evaluation , and make judging more objective , rather than based on inscrutable , subjective opinions . This also helps students and trainees know what to aim for to score highly . Herman et al . [ 14 ] identified four elements that make up scoring rubrics , which we clarify as two key points with corresponding elaboration points : 1 ) One or more traits or dimensions that serve as the basis for judging the student response . • Definitions and examples to clarify the meaning of each trait or dimension . 2 ) A scale of values on which to rate each dimension . • Standards of excellence for specified performance levels ac - companied by models or examples of each level . Therefore , a rubric needs to have dimensions ( also known as criteria ) on which to judge the performance , and a scale rating ( or score ) for each criteria . We focus on the high - level key points , since we are leveraging a known rubric , rather than developing them and training new judges or trainees . We assume that users of rubric - informed explainable AI ( XAI ) will have the implicit knowledge of definitions and examples , and know how to score each criteria . 3 . 2 Scoring figure skating Figure skating is an competitive sport where athletes skate to music , to demonstrate their technical athletic and qualitative artistic skills . It is a key winter sport in many championships , including the Winter Olympic Games . While many spectators enjoy watching the sport , it is often a mystery to understand how skater performances are judged . Instead of being subjective or counterintuitive , judges actually use a formal process — the International Skating Union ( ISU ) Judging System [ 37 ] — to score the performance of each skater . Judges use a score sheet to inform and guide their scoring . Formally , this score sheet is a rubric with multiple criteria with separate rating scores that are additive . For this work , we focus on the single - skating short - program event , where each skater performs for about three minutes , and is subjected to more rules and restrictions on their actions to execute , compared to free - form skating . Table 1 shows an example score sheet with judgement results from human judges during the 2014 European Figure Skating Championships . The total score consists of a combined Technical Element Score ( TES ) and a combined Program Component Score ( PCS ) . Skaters perform a sequence of elements ( actions ) in a schedule that is known ahead of the performance . The chosen elements and how well each was executed affects the TES . For example , a skater may choose a sequence with easier elements , but would be expected to earn fewer points than another skater with a more complex sequence . This determines the Base score . For each element , the skater may execute it very well or poorly , receiving a positive or negative Grade of Execution ( GOE ) score accordingly . GOE spans − 5 to 5 . Each technical element is thus scored by adding Base and GOE . There are three main types of elements — Jumps , Spins , and Step Sequences — and the Transition between them . A jump is an action for which a skater leaps into the air , rotates at high speed , and lands after one or more revolutions . There are 6 types of jumps : Toe Loop ( T ) , Salchow ( S ) , Loop ( Lo ) , Flip ( F ) , Lutz ( Lz ) , and Axel ( A ) , which are distinguished by the way they take off and land when entering each jump . Different types are variously difficult and will affect the expected score for the element . Furthermore , each type of jump is assessed by the number of rotations ; higher number of rotations are IUI 2023 , Mar 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , Australia Matsuyama , Kawaguchi , and Lim more difficult to execute . A spin is a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation on ice with either foot on the rink . There are three basic types of spins : Upright ( USp ) , Sit ( SSp ) , and Camel ( CSp ) . Spins can be performed individually or as a sequence combining different spin types with a change of position or foot , e . g . , Change Foot Sit Spin ( CSSp ) . For spins , judges see the difficulty , smoothness , and stability of movements . For example , a difficult entrance to the spin and continuous spins with stable posture will earn the skater a higher score . A step sequence is a technique that uses the entire rink for continuous footwork and performance . Skaters show steps and turns in a pattern , e . g . , Rocker turn and Bracket turn , on the ice while fully utilizing the ice skating rink in accordance with the character of the music . There are three types of step sequences : Straight line step sequence ( SISt ) , Circular step sequence ( CiSt ) , and Serpentine step sequence ( SeSt ) . Step sequences must match the music , be performed effortlessly throughout with good energy , flow and execution , and must have deep edges , clean turns and steps . Other than scoring specific elements in the sequence , the skater is graded on overall qualities of her performance . This is indicated in the PCS score to judge various components : Skating Skills , Tran - sition / Linking Footwork , Performance / Execution , Choreography / Composition , and Interpretation . Skating Skills score the over - all cleanness , sureness , edge control , and flow over the ice surface demonstrated by a command of the skating vocabulary ( edges , turns , steps , etc . ) , the clarity of technique , and the use of effortless power to accelerate and vary speed . Transitions / Linking Footwork scores the varied and purposeful use of intricate footwork , positions , move - ments , and holds linking all elements . Although this criterion may overlap with the TES for a step sequence , which include transitions and footwork , judges look at the entire performance to measure the quality to score this PCS component . Performance / Execution scores the involvement of the skater physically , emotionally , and in - tellectually as she delivers the intent of the music and composition . Choreography / Composition scores how intentionally developed and original is the arrangement of all types of movements according to the principles of the musical phrase , space , pattern , and structure . Interpretation scores the personal , creative , and genuine translation of the rhythm , character , and content of the music to movement . 4 TECHNICAL APPROACH We introduce IRIS , an I nterpretable R ubric - I nformed S egmentation method to predict and explain video - based action quality assess - ment ( AQA ) . It is ante - hoc interpretable [ 32 , 47 ] to explain how it derived its judgement score . It is informed by a rubric to determine what to consider when calculating its judgement . It performs seg - mentation to specify moments of a performance to judge specific criteria . We implemented this for the application of figure skating , but the high - level approach is generalizable to other video - based AQA with established rubrics ( e . g . , diving , dancing , cooking ) . IRIS provides four key rubric features ( Score , Sequence , Seg - ments , and Subscores ) to predict and explain its judgement . Score is the final judgement , Sequence describes the actions to be judged ( for technical elements ) , Segments identify when each action was judged based on specific criteria , and Subscores indicate how each specific criteria was judged ( for TES and PCS ) . Fig . 2 illustrates the architecture of IRIS , in the following subsections . 4 . 1 Data preparation Before modeling , we collected and processed data to gather neces - sary information for IRIS . We obtained video data of figure skating from the MIT - Skate dataset [ 29 ] which includes 150 videos of short - event figure skating from various championships in 2008 , 2010 , 2012 , and 2014 . Each video is about three minutes long , which we converted to 4D tensors with 2D for x - y pixels , 1D for time , and 1D for color channels . We collected rubric data as score sheets for each figure skater from online sources of the championship re - sults maintained by ISU ( e . g . , ISU European Championships 2014 1 ) . The score sheets are in PDF format , which we parsed with optical character recognition using Adobe Acrobat Pro v21 . From this , we obtained the skater name , TES base , GOE and total subscores , and PCS subscores and linked them to each skating performance video . To train segmentation ( described later ) , we manually annotated when each element was performed . This was done by researchers , with advice from practicing figure skaters . With the data prepared , we can model the prediction for automatic judgment , which we describe next . Finally , for simplicity and to provide sufficient data per class , we aggregated technical elements into broad categories of Jump , Spin , Step Sequence and Transition . Future work can train to recognize more specific action labels with more data . 4 . 2 Base embedding for implicit knowledge The first step in IRIS is to predict a vector representation of the video . As is common for video data , we train a 3D CNN 𝑀 0 , specifically I3D [ 7 ] , to take a video tensor input 𝒙 and predict an embedding ˆ 𝒛 𝑡 of the video to represent information in the video . It predicts a vector embedding for each 0 . 534 - sec time window ( 16 frames at 29 . 97 fps like in [ 34 , 45 ] ) . Each video has up to 356 windows with zero - padding , i . e . , all videos are no longer than 3min 10s . Hence , ˆ 𝒛 𝑡 is a 2D tensor with vectors across time . Much prior work use these embeddings to predict the judgement score by inputting them into a feedfoward neural network [ 28 ] . We compare against this baseline in our modeling study later . 4 . 3 Sequence of foreknown actions With IRIS , we extract sequence information 𝒂 𝜏 from the score sheet of each skater . This sequence of actions ( technical elements ) de - scribes which actions to expect in sequence , but not specifically at what times . Nevertheless , assuming that the skater does not change her schedule , this sequence will be very informative to guide the overall scoring . Indeed , human judges know ahead of time what actions to expect from the skater and can judge more accurately . Furthermore , their judgement of each action leverages knowledge of whether the scheduled action is easy or difficult ( affecting the base TES score ) , and helps the judge to narrow down their com - parison of the action against similar ones ( e . g . , jumps against other jumps ) . Surprisingly , this crucial information has been neglected in prior work , and our modeling study evaluation shows its strong effectiveness to improve score prediction performance . Thus , we employed Sequence information for our predictions in IRIS . Specifically , we used it to improve our Segmentation ( described in the next section ) , and to improve TES subscore prediction . 1 http : / / www . isuresults . com / results / ec2014 / IRIS : Interpretable Rubric - Informed Segmentation for Action Quality Assessment IUI 2023 , Mar 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , Australia + + + + ො𝒛 𝑡 ෝ𝒚 𝜋 ෝ𝒚 Δ𝜏 ෝ𝒚 𝜏 ො𝑦 𝒚 𝜏 0 ෝ 𝒂 𝑡 𝒂 𝜏 𝒙 ො𝒛 𝜏 Segments Subscores ( PCS ) Base Subscores ( TES ) Δ Subscores ( TES ) Subscores ( TES ) Score 𝒚 𝜋 𝒚 𝜏 Sequence Figure 2 : Architecture of IRIS showing how it leverages rubric information ( Sequence ˆ 𝑎 𝑡 and base Subscores ˆ 𝒚 𝜏 0 ) to provide explanations ( Segments , TES GOE Δ Subscores ˆ 𝒚 Δ 𝜏 , and TES ˆ 𝒚 𝜏 and PCS ˆ 𝒚 𝜋 subscores ) to predict the Score ˆ 𝒚 of a figure skating performance in a video 𝒙 .

This is a sequence - to - sequence model that hierarchically convolves over time , consid - ering short - term and long - term historical data . We trained 𝑀 𝑡 using supervised learning with manually annotated segments as ground truth labels ; e . g . , we annotated when a jump starts and ends . TCN prediction suffers from over - segmentation , where there are more segments predicted than the true segments ; e . g . , segment la - bels may flip - flop between different labels instead of being a contin - uous one . First , as in [ 13 ] , we used a smoothing loss regularization using the truncated mean squared error : 𝐿 𝜇 = 1 𝑇 (cid:205) 𝑇𝑡 max ( 𝜖 𝑡 , 𝜖 ) , where 𝜖 𝑡 = ( log ˆ 𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) − log ˆ 𝑚 ( 𝑡 − 1 ) ) 2 is the squared of log differ - ences and 𝜖 is the truncation hyperparameter . This merges small segments into fewer , larger ones . Next , we employed a heuristic approach by i ) counting the expected number of each action type 𝑎 known from the score card sequence information 𝑛 𝑎 , and ii ) se - lecting the longest 𝑛 𝑎 segments for each action type . All remaining unselected segments were re - labeled as transitions . This results in reasonable segmentation performance ( see Fig . 5 ) . With the time series action labels , we partition the time series embeddings ˆ 𝒛 𝑡 based on when specific actions started and ended . These are the action sequence embeddings ˆ 𝒛 𝜏 . We zero - pad all embeddings to the same length for standardized processing next . 4 . 5 Subscores of multiple specific criteria IRIS predicts several subscores , 7 TES subscore for separate tech - nical elements , and 5 PCS subscores for the overall performance . Having identified each sequence element , we can predict a TES subscore for each element . Noting that the score cards used by human judges split TES subscores into Base and GOE , where Base is pre - determined , we realize that only GOE needs to be predicted . Knowing the Base score is highly informative , thus predicting GOE is a much simpler problem which would be more accurate than pre - dicting the full TES subscore . Furthermore , knowing the expected element being performed at the sequence helps the judge to narrow the scope of judging . Hence , for each sequence step 𝜏 , we train a conditional convolutional neural network ( c - CNN ) 𝑀 Δ 𝜏 that takes the sequence embedding ˆ 𝒛 𝜏 with its corresponding actual action label 𝑎 𝜏 to predict the GOE ˆ 𝑦 Δ 𝜏 for that sequence . To obtain the total subscore for this element , we add the Base and GOE subscores , i . e . , ˆ 𝑦 𝜏 = ˆ 𝑦 𝜏 0 + ˆ 𝑦 Δ 𝜏 . The total TES subscore for all technical elements are simply added together , i . e . , ˆ 𝑦 Σ 𝜏 = (cid:205) 𝜏 ˆ 𝑦 𝜏 . We predict PCS subscores differently , since they are based on overall performance instead of specific actions . Using the time series embeddings of the whole video ˆ 𝒛 𝑡 , we train a multi - task CNN model 𝑀 𝜋 to predict multiple PCS subscores ˆ 𝒚 𝑝 𝑖 together . Training a multi - task model instead of multiple , independent models improves accuracy due to correlations between the predictions . The PCS subscores are combined into a total PCS subscore , i . e . , ˆ 𝑦 Σ 𝜋 = (cid:205) 𝜋 ˆ 𝑦 𝜋 . 4 . 6 Score Finally , the total Score is predicted by simply adding the TES and PCS scores together , i . e . , ˆ 𝑦 = ˆ 𝑦 Σ 𝜏 + ˆ 𝑦 Σ 𝜋 . In summary , IRIS exploits knowledge that judges already know from rubric score cards , and adheres to the criteria that human judges use to guide and account for their decisions . These meth - ods help IRIS to be 1 ) significantly more accurate , 2 ) intrinsically interpretable to show its working to derive its final score , and 3 ) trustworthy since it uses the domain - standard rubric for judging . 4 . 7 Implementation We implemented IRIS using PyTorch and trained on an Nvidia RTX A6000 GPU , with a learning rate of 0 . 0005 , batch size 60 , and the Adam optimizer . Training converged within 300 epochs . We trained IRIS to predict Segments ˆ 𝒂 𝑡 , TES Δ Subscores ˆ 𝒚 Δ 𝜏 , PCS Subscores ˆ 𝒚 𝜋 with uniform training loss hyperparameters , i . e . , all 1 .

First , we demonstrate its in - terpretability with a visualization of an ice skating performance . Second , we conducted a quantitative modeling study comparing it against the baseline models . Third , we conducted a formative user study with experienced figure skaters to qualitatively investigate the usefulness and trustworthiness of its rubric - informed features . 5 . 1 Demonstration Study We presented the four key rubric - informed features in a unified visualization user interface ( UI ) shown to participants ( see Fig . 3 ) . The key aspects of the user interface are a video player on the left , and score sheet on the right . The total Score is displayed on the top - right corner . To show Segments information , we augment the video player by overlaying a color - annotated timeline over the seek bar . The colors indicate which of the four action types ( transition , jump , spin , and step sequence ) were automatically identified , and when they occurred . Users can examine specific actions by tracking the seek bar to the annotated location , and playing the video . To present the Sequence and Subscores information , we leverage the score sheet layout typical of the ISU Judging System ( IJS ) [ 37 ] . We simplified the table to minimally include the elements ( to be ) ex - ecuted , Technical Elements Scores ( TES ) , and Program Components Scores ( PCS ) . The TES subscores are calculated for each element , and further subdivided into a Base score which is standard for the scheduled element , and known ahead of time , the AI predicted Grade of Execution ( GOE ) to judge how much the skater’s perfor - mance was above or below average , and total TES subscore which is Base + GOE . The PCS is also divided into separate program com - ponents ( e . g . , skating skills , choreography ) , which are determined across the whole skating performance . There is a factor multiplied on the PCS subscores , which is 1 . 00 for male skaters and 0 . 80 for female skaters . The bold numbers at the bottom of columns indicate sums across elements or components . Finally , experienced figure skaters know that the Score = TES + PCS . 5 . 2 Modeling Studies We conducted two modeling studies on the performance of IRIS : 1 ) an ablation study to examine how each rubric - informed feature improves the model prediction performance , and 2 ) a benchmark - ing study to evaluate whether IRIS performs better than baseline models . Just like prior studies , all models were trained on randomly chosen 120 videos , and evaluated with a test set of 30 videos . We describe the evaluation metrics , models compared , and results . 5 . 2 . 1 Evaluation metrics . For all comparisons , we evaluated how well each model can predict the human score in the dataset . Most prior work evaluated using the Spearman rank correlation coeffi - cient that indicates whether the ranking of skaters were preserved based on actual and predicted scores . However , this neglects how much the score may have changed . We further calculated the Pear - son correlation coefficient to see how well IRIS can preserve the linearity in score predictions . We also add to prior work by exam - ining how well IRIS can predict TES and PCS subscores separately . To evaluate segmentation performance , we calculated the Dice coefficient which indicates how much the predicted segment ˆ 𝒂 overlaps with the actual segment 𝒂 , i . e . , 2 ( 𝒂 · ˆ 𝒂 ) / ( | 𝒂 | 2 + | ˆ 𝒂 | 2 ) . 5 . 2 . 2 Comparison models . For the ablation study , we evaluated different variants of the IRIS model to predict combinations of base and explanatory information : Score ˆ 𝑦 , TES + PCS ( ˆ 𝑦 Σ 𝜏 , ˆ 𝑦 Σ 𝜋 ) , Subscores ( ˆ 𝒚 𝜏 , 𝒚 𝜋 ) , Δ Subscores ( ˆ 𝒚 Δ 𝜏 , 𝒚 𝜋 ) , Segments ˆ 𝒂 𝑡 . For the benchmarking study , we evaluated IRIS against the fol - lowing state - of - the - art models : 1 ) 3DCNN - LSTM [ 28 ] puts video embeddings into an LSTM to predict the total scores with long - duration patterns . 2 ) 3DCNN - BiLSTM [ 28 ] uses Bi - directional LSTM instead of plain LSTM to capture time patterns forwards and backwards in the video . This reduces early forgetting . 3 ) 3DCNN - ResNet - GCN [ 45 ] uses a video 3DCNN model with graph convolutional network to model cross - dependencies be - tween video segments .

Fig . 4 ( Left ) and Appendix Table 2 shows the results from our ablation study . As expected , combining all interpretability features led to the best performing model . Predicting with subscores helped IRIS to improve its total score prediction performance , indi - cating that decomposed analysis was beneficial . Leveraging the TES base subscores helped to significantly improve the performance for predicting TES . Segmentation helped to improve TES subscore prediction performance significantly , TES Δ subscore prediction per - formance slightly , but not necessarily for PCS . The segmentation in IRIS had good a Dice coefficient of 0 . 79 . Fig . 5 shows an example segmentation . Better segmentation with higher IoU also generally resulted in better TES score prediction as shown in Fig . 6 . Fig . 4 ( Right ) and Appendix Table 3 shows the results from our benchmarking study . The basic 3DCNN and multi - task predictions in simpler IRIS models were weaker than other baselines , but IRIS was better when it modeled with TES base subscores and segmenta - tion . This indicates that being informed with rubrics and including interpretability can be more beneficial than using esoteric , generic time - series features that other baselines have .

Error bars indicate standard error . 5 . 3 Formative User Study Having shown that IRIS improves model prediction performance , we next evaluated whether the explanations provided by IRIS are useful . We did so with practicing figure skaters who have domain expertise to meaningfully interpret the explanations . Our research objective is to determine the usefulness and trustworthiness of vari - ous rubric - informed explanations for automatic action quality as - sessment in figure skating videos . We investigated why users found each explanation feature useful and how they used the feature . The study was approved by our institution’s institutional review board . 5 . 3 . 1 Experiment Method . We conducted a formative user study to collect user opinions and experiences on different features of IRIS by implementing different variants of the IRIS visualization . Each variant progressively adds more UI features : • Score ( S ) that shows the AI prediction to judge the performance . • S + Sequence ( SS ) that also shows the sequence of technical elements that the performer planned to execute . This is what human judges know ahead of each judging session . It does not include any subscore information for each technical element . • SS + Segments ( SSS ) that also shows the AI prediction of the time segments when each technical element was executed . • SSS + Subscores ( SSSS ) that also shows all TES ( base and GOE ) and PCS subscores . This is the most comprehensive UI . IUI 2023 , Mar 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , Australia Matsuyama , Kawaguchi , and Lim For simplicity , we implemented the UI variants in presentation slides , though the data is computed by the IRIS model , and thus realistic of the model behavior . We presented all variants within - subjects to the participant , with fixed order : S , SS , SSS , SSSS . This was not counterbalanced , since each latter variant contains more information and would confound with a learning effect . We priori - tized a qualitative formative study instead of a larger - scale summa - tive study to gather nuanced insights regarding the use of rubric - informed explanations , and because of the difficulty to recruit a large number of trained domain experts ( practicing figure skaters ) . 5 . 3 . 2 Experiment Procedure . The procedure each participant was : 1 ) Introduction about the experiment objective and procedure , and description about the figure skating videos . 2 ) Consent to participate with their voice and interactions recorded . 3 ) Two video sessions with : i ) Video is played lasting about 3 minutes . ii ) Score ( S ) prediction is displayed after the video is played , fol - lowed by several interview questions discussed ( details later ) . iii ) Sequence ( SS ) information of the technical elements is next displayed and questions posed again . iv ) Segments ( SSS ) of when each action was performed are next displayed and questions posed again . v ) Subscores ( SSSS ) are displayed and questions posed again . vi ) Interview questions to ask about : 1 ) Do you agree or disagree with the AI judgement score ? [ 7 - pt Likert ] . Why or why not ? 2 ) How do you think the AI scored the performance ? Do you agree or disagree with its method ? Why or why not ? 3 ) Do you agree or disagree that you understand how AI pre - dicts scores ? ( Perceived Understanding ) [ 7 - pt Likert ] 4 ) Would you score differently ? How so ? 5 ) Which part of the UI did you find ( not ) useful ? Why ( not ) ? 6 ) Any suggestions for improvement ? 5 . 3 . 3 Findings . We recruited 10 participants through snowball sampling from two university figure skating clubs and one orga - nization in Japan . Discussions were conducted in Japanese and translated to English . We acknowledge the sample limitation due to the challenge of recruiting rare expertise , yet benefited from very interesting expert feedback . Their average age was 23 . 8 ( SD = 8 . 6 ) years old and 8 were female . All had experience in figure skating spanning 2 - 13 years ( M = 6 . 6 ) . We determined participant expertise by asking their Skill Test Level [ 39 ] . One participant had not taken the test , thus we considered her a novice . Others were skilled with M = 2 . 6 out of 5 ( SD = 1 . 7 ) , and max = 5 . Due to Covid - 19 restrictions , the experiment was conducted remotely over Zoom with screen sharing and audio recording . The interview sessions took 81 . 8min on average ( SD = 10 . 5 ) with $ 20 USD compensation . Figure 7 shows the quantitative results of participant ratings . Participants somewhat agreed with the AI prediction score ( M = 1 . 05 ) , though there was no difference among UI variants . They found the full UI variant with all explanations easiest to understand ( M SSSS = 1 . 05 ) , followed by the UI with Segments ( M SSS = − 0 . 05 ) , but did not understand how the AI worked when only viewing the Score ( M S = − 0 . 85 ) and Sequence variants ( M SS = − 0 . 70 ) . Next , we analyzed the recorded sessions and performed a the - matic analysis in terms of our research objective to understand the helpfulness and trustworthiness of each rubric - informed feature . Themes were generated and refined by the first and last authors . Score only . Participants mostly depended on their own expe - rience and intuition to judge how the score was derived , or were clueless about how the AI could perceive and make judgements . P4 mentioned that she " didn’t know and didn’t have a clue " . P5 saw that the skater " was off - balance on the first jump , so [ he ] was going to drop [ the score ] a little more [ than what the AI scored ] " . P10 " felt that it was difficult to understand the scoring method from the images and scores alone , and felt that it would be most convincing if we could come up with a protocol like the scoring table used in competitions " . Some participants attributed advanced capabilities to the AI , even though this was not implemented . P2 " thought the AI was scoring the number of jump rotations , the flow after landing , and so on " . Sequence . With the sequence information , many participants realized that the AI considered specific actions in its judgement . P2 remarked that " by knowing the elements in advance , I knew approx - imately how many points the basic score would be , which made it easier to predict the score , and I thought [ the AI’s score ] was reason - able . " . P3 noted that he had interpreted the AI reasoning in the Score condition " by guessing earlier , but had suspected that [ the AI ] was calculating based on the basic points of each element . " The Sequence enabled participants to discuss the scoring more carefully . P5 saw that the skater " was doing 3T + 3T with low score for a triple - turn combo , but I thought [ the score ] could have be a little higher . " Segments . Participants highly appreciated seeing the action seg - mentation explanations from the AI . This allowed them to perceive what the AI could notice . P8 " was amazed that the steps were properly recognized . I thought that if it could recognize them , it must be able to judge the movements of the feet as well . " Several participants felt that the segments would be helpful for less - knowledgeable spectators . " Jumps and spins can be understood even by people who don’t know skating , but some people don’t know about steps , so it may be useful for them " ( P10 ) . P2 " was impressed to see that the jumps , spins , and steps were detected " . However , he also remarked " on the other hand , it is difficult to judge whether the score is appropriate because it is not clear at what step and for what reason the score is given . " Thus , he and other participants still wondered how each segment was scored . Some participants also noticed inaccuracies in the segmentation . P5 " thought the spin detection was a little fast . It appeared that the step had started before the step sequence was detected . " P6 noted that " the end of spin detection was early . " Nevertheless , these participants remained positive about the AI segmentation capability . Subscores . With the subscores , participants found the AI most useful . P3 felt that " it is easier to be convinced if you can see the detailed scores . I thought it was more convincing when I could see the completion of each element ( e . g . , first jump , fifth spin , etc . ) , and the points for possible mistakes were minus . " . P9 felt that the AI " can be evaluated objectively without human error . It is useful to visualize how much points are added or subtracted from the base score . " The subscores stimulated much discussion about the judging correctness . P1 argued that " fewer points should have been deducted for [ the ] 3Lo [ technical element ] , but everything else seems to be OK . " P2 remarked that " 3T3T looked very well put together , so more points should be awarded . I thought FCSp3 deserved a higher score because [ the skater ] was doing something more difficult than the usual Camel spin . The ( high ) score for Choreography was surprisingly satisfactory .

Error bars indicate 95 % confidence interval . Participants also requested for more details . P3 wanted to " know the type of jump . " , rather than just knowing that one was observed . " It would be nice to know the types of spins , postures , deformations , as well as the types and difficulties of spins . This would be useful for judging the level of the skaters " ( P3 ) . P9 " I would also like to know the height of the spin , and whether 3D expression is achieved . " Participants were mostly positive about the TES subscore pre - dictions , but had varying opinions about the more qualitative PCS subscores . P5 identified that " the PCS scores , such as Skating skills , were all in the 6 - point range . The top scorers get about 7 points , so I thought [ the AI’s score ] was reasonable . " P7 found " the difference in PCS scores is disconcerting . I don’t think it would be like this if a person gave it . " The nuance and subjectivity in judging PCS also raised questions . P1 commented that " even if [ the PCS score ] is de - composed , I wonder how it is determined . " Participants also needed more information to help to properly assess some PCS aspects . P8 found that " it is hard to know how the expressiveness of the music , which is one of the best aspects of figure skating , was scored . " In summary , participants found that the latter explanation fea - tures aligned well with their expected criteria for judging figure skating , and highly appreciated the increasing details to account for the final score . The potential of IRIS is neatly expressed by P9 : " I think that the introduction of AI will be beneficial to the players because it will eliminate bias and subjectivity in this area , as I believe that human preferences have various influences . " 6 DISCUSSION We have shown that IRIS performed better than the current methods to automatically judge figure skating , and is perceived as more understandable and trustworthy by domain experts . We discuss limitations and generalizations of IRIS for interpretable AQA . 6 . 1 Generalizing rubric - informed AQA In this work , we studied figure skating as a representative example of sports that are qualitatively judged , yet have established rubrics for consistency . We believe that IRIS can be used to automatically score other qualitative sports or performances that are guided by rubrics , such as , dancing , skiing , diving . Note that while some sports activities are very brief , they can still contain a sequence of actions . For example , a diving action consists of jumping from a diving board , performing an acrobatic sequence in the air , and entering the water . Appropriate labeling of these steps would provide more detailed information to divers and audiences and improve their understanding of the performance . IRIS is not meant for sports that use other scoring methods , such as counting goals ( e . g . , soccer , basketball , golf , fencing , boxing ) . IRIS is not designed to generate a rubric ; decision tree or rule mining approaches can already do this , albeit with the risk of learning spurious relationships . 6 . 2 Need for interpretability of artistic quality In this work , we provided detailed information on the technical and artistic criteria of figure skating by revealing additive segments and subscores . In our user study , our participants requested for more justification on how each technical element or overall qualities are considered high or low scoring . Future work can provide two approaches to address this . 1 ) Use XAI saliency map techniques ( e . g . , [ 33 ] ) to highlight important pixels or poses that the model focused on for predicting each TES or PCS score . However , without properly constraints ( e . g . , on pose joints ) , the highlights may be spurious . 2 ) Use heuristic methods based on meaningful movement features , such as Laban Movement Analysis ( LMA ) [ 4 ] that interprets the artistic movement with four dimensions ( Body , Effort , Shape , and Space ) to describe the quality of movement , body posture and shape , and how the body is using the space . A good quality as defined with LMA should correspond to a high technical or artistic score . 7 CONCLUSION We proposed IRIS , an I nterpretable R ubric - I nformed S egmentation method to predict and explain video - based action quality assess - ment ( AQA ) . IRIS is : 1 ) interpretable to account for its judgement process , 2 ) informed by a rubric to judge by specific criteria , and 3 ) performs segmentation to locate specific sections to judge each criteria . We implemented IRIS for the application domain of figure skating to predict a Score and explain with Sequence , Segments , and Subscores . As a result , by being rubric - informed , IRIS is better guided to make more accurate score predictions , is more account - able by justifying its decisions based on domain - accepted criteria , and hence more trustworthy to practicing figure skaters .
