Woese , University of Illinois , Urbana , IL , and approved May 28 , 2010 ( received for review January 27 , 2010 ) Endocytosis is a process by which extracellular material such as macromolecules can be incorporated into cells via a membrane - traf ﬁ cking system . Although universal among eukaryotes , endocyto - sis has not been identi ﬁ ed in Bacteria or Archaea . However , intra - cellular membranes are known to compartmentalize cells of bacteria inthephylum Planctomycetes , suggestingthepotentialforendocyto - sis and membrane traf ﬁ cking in members of this phylum . Here we show that cells of the planctomycete Gemmata obscuriglobus have the ability to uptake proteins present in the external milieu in an energy - dependent process analogous to eukaryotic endocytosis , and that internalized proteins are associated with vesicle mem - branes . Occurrence of such ability in a bacterium is consistent with autogenous evolution of endocytosis and the endomembrane sys - tem in an ancestral noneukaryote cell . eukaryotes | evolution | endocytosis | bacteria | planctomycetes A major unsolved problem in biology is how the many unique characteristics of the eukaryote cell evolved , including endo - membranes and their dynamic features , such as endocytosis ( 1 ) . Endocytosis is known as a eukaryote - speci ﬁ c process by which cells internalize molecules from the plasma membrane and recycle them back to the surface or sort them to lysosomes for degradation ( 2 ) . There is evidence that endocytosis must have been present in cells as far back as the last eukaryotic common ancestor ( LECA ) ( 3 , 4 ) , but it has never been reported to occur in members of the domains Bacteria and Archaea . Recent hypotheses have placed the origin of endocytosis - like mechanisms as a primary step toward evolution of compartmentalization ( 3 , 4 ) . Surprisingly , subcellular compartmentalization is not a unique feature of the eukaryote cell : it has been discovered that a restricted group of bacteria belonging to the phyla Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia possess such compartmentalization ( 5 – 8 ) . The planctomycetes are classi ﬁ ed in Bacteria on phylogenetic and genomic grounds ( 9 – 11 ) and form a divergent group , reported to branch deeply within the Bacteria when slowly evolving alignment positions are used for generating 16S rRNA - based phylogenetic trees , although not necessarily when other methods are used . Phylogenetic and other data in - dicate that the planctomycetes are related most closely to bacterial phyla Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae ( 12 , 13 , 14 ) . However , planctomycetes possess unusual properties such as budding re - production ( 15 – 17 ) , sterol biosynthesis ( 18 ) , permanently con - densednucleoidsdifferentfromuncondensed “ corraline ” nucleoids of other bacteria but similar to those of chlamydial elementary bodies ( 19 ) , absence of cell wall peptidoglycan ( 20 – 22 ) , and most strikingly , formation of intracellular membrane - bounded com - partments ( 7 ) . Some planctomycetes such as Gemmata obscuriglo - bus are compartmentalized into a nucleoid containing DNA , a ribosome - containing cytoplasm ( riboplasm ) , and a ribosome - free cytoplasm ( paryphoplasm ) ( 5 ) . A single intracytoplasmic mem - brane ( ICM ) separates the riboplasm from the paryphoplasm , with the paryphoplasm de ﬁ ned as a compartment between the cyto - plasmic membrane and ICM ( 5 ) . Planctomycetes are also excep - tional among Bacteria because they carry genes homologous to those coding for membrane coat ( MC ) proteins central to eukary - otic endocytosis ( 23 ) . Taken together , the unusual characteristics of planctomycetes suggest that these bacteria might possess a simple form of endocytosis . Results and Discussion G . obscuriglobus Cells Are Able to Internalize GFP via an Energy - Dependent Process . To investigate the possibility of an endocyto - sis - like mechanism in the planctomycete bacterium G . obscuriglo - bus , we incubated cells with GFP and examined them via confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) . Remarkably , the protein was detected inside the cells ( Fig . 1 A ) , usually within 5 min . Location of GFP inside the cells rather than on the cell surface was indicated by the optical sectioning inherent with CLSM . The uptake of GFP seemed to be energy - dependent , because if incubated at 0 °C or in the presence of sodium azide , an inhibitor of respiration and oxi - dative phosphorylation , cells did not take up GFP ( Fig . 1 B and Fig . S1 A ) . Temperature sensitivity of GFP uptake was also demon - stratedbyitsinhibitionat37°C ( Fig . S1 A ) , a temperature above the maximum growth temperature of G . obscuriglobus ( 24 ) . ATP sup - pressedtheinhibitoryeffectof sodiumazide ( Fig . 1 B andFig . S1 B ) , con ﬁ rming that GFP uptake is an energy - dependent process . The uptakeoffull - lengthGFPbycellsof G . obscuriglobus wascon ﬁ rmed by Western blot analysis ( Fig . 1 C ) . As expected , nonplanctomycete bacterium Escherichia coli , acting asa negativecontrol , did not take up GFP ( Fig . 1 C ) . Such an uptake process is saturable , as expected for a receptor - mediated process , the concentration of proteins at which the uptake process reaches saturation corresponding to ≈ 10 μ g / mL ( Fig . S2 ) . This ﬁ nding demonstrates the internalization of proteins in a bacterium . Internalization of intact external macro - molecules , and more speci ﬁ cally proteins , has not been recorded in members of domains Bacteria or Archaea . Some bacteria , such as Lactococcus lactis , can use proteins only by degrading them at the cellsurfaceusingproteasesandincorporatingtheresultingpeptides ( 25 ) . A 35 - aa oligopeptide is so far the longest shown to bind to a bacterial receptor ( 26 ) . We next tested whether the mechanism of uptake is receptor mediated . Coincubation of GFP with unequal ratios of Cy3 - labeled Ig resulted in dominant internalization of the protein in excess , whereas equal internalization was detected when a 1 : 1 ratio was used ( Fig . S3 ) . This implied that different proteins can be internalized by G . obscuriglobus and that they are competing for Author contributions : T . G . A . L . , E . S . , and J . A .

Such assumption was further supported by the fact that an excess of BSA , ovalbumin , or GST greatly di - minished uptake of GFP ( Fig . 1 D and Fig . S4 ) . Additionally , plasmid DNA did not affect GFP uptake ( Fig . 1 D ) . A Cy3 - labeled 25 - mer oligonucleotide was not internalized by G . obscuriglobus ( Fig . S5 ) , demonstrating that in contrast to proteins , DNA is not internalized by this bacterium . Considered together , these results are consistent with a receptor - mediated protein uptake mecha - nism in G . obscuriglobus . Proteins Internalized by G . obscuriglobus Are Compartmentalized and Degraded in the Paryphoplasm Cell Region . To gain more in - formation about the mechanism of uptake , we investigated the subcellular localization of different proteins after their inter - nalization . Coincubation of Cy5 - labeled ﬂ uorescent streptavidin or Cy3 - labeled Ig with GFP resulted in colocalization of the two dis - tinct proteins to the same compartment ( Fig . S6 ) . The proteins were found to be restricted to an outer region of the cell cytoplasm , within the external cytoplasmic membrane indicated by Synap - toRed stain , and distinct from the DAPI - stained region containing DNA ( Fig . 2 A ) . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) exami - nation of thin sections of G . obscuriglobus cells preincubated with GFP de ﬁ ned this region as the paryphoplasm ( Fig . 2 B and sche - matic diagram Fig . 2 C ) . This suggests a functional role for par - yphoplasm as a protein - segregating compartment where exogenous proteins can be accumulated . We next tested whether the in - ternalized proteins are proteolysed in this compartment . Cells were incubated with DQ Green BSA ( DQBSA ) , ﬂ uorescence of which appears only upon proteolysis , and with IgG - Cy3 , the latter added shortly before examination and serving as a marker for the par - yphoplasm . The ﬂ uorescent DQBSA proteolysis product colo - calized with IgG - Cy3 in the paryphoplasm ( Fig . S7 A ) , illustrating the role of this compartment in degradation of internalized pro - teins . The con ﬁ rmation that internalized proteins are degraded was obtained by ﬁ rst incubating G . obscuriglobus with a mouse IgG and then monitoring its fate — proteolysis of the Ig was detected by Western blot analysis ( Fig . S7 B ) . GFP was not suitable for this assay because it is highly resistant to proteolysis ( 27 ) .

Internalized Proteins Are Associated with Vesicles . We next used immunogold labeling of high - pressure frozen cells to investigate whether the internalized GFP was associated with any speci ﬁ c intracellular structures . Gold particles indicating presence of GFP in the paryphoplasm were often seen lining vesicle - like entities ca . 50 – 200 nm wide bounded by a single bilayer membrane ( Fig . 3 A , Insets 2 – 4 ) . In some cases , gold particles were seen lining an infolding of the cytoplasmic membrane ( Fig . 3 B ) , perhaps repre - senting an initial stage in the process of GFP internalization . An invagination of cytoplasmic membrane was also seen during up - take of HRP - conjugated antibody , the reaction product of which was surrounded by an infolding membrane showing continuity with the cytoplasmic membrane ( Fig . 3 C ) . These results suggest formation of vesicle structures in the cells allowing extracellular molecules to be internalized . Remarkably , proteins possessing structural features of eukaryotic MC proteins have been recently described in planctomycetes ( 23 ) . MC proteins are related to the clathrin and coat protein families , all members of which are as - sociated with vesicle formation or membrane curvature , and some of which ( e . g . , clathrin ) are necessary for receptor - mediated en - docytosis . The similarity in secondary and tertiary structure be - tween gp4978 , an MC - like protein of G . obscuriglobus , and clathrin heavy chain of yeast is illustrated in Fig . S8 . An antibody had been previously raised against G . obscuriglobus gp4978 ( 23 ) . In our study this anti - gp4978 antibody reacted with vesicle - like structures within the paryphoplasm ( Fig . 3 D ) . In some cases , gp4978 - reactive material was associated with cytoplasmic membranes apparently in the ﬁ rst stages of membrane invagination ( Fig . 3 D , Inset 3 ) . To con ﬁ rm that the internalized proteins are associated with membranes and vesicles , G . obscuriglobus cells were lysed by sonication and subjected to subcellular fractionation . After cen - trifugation at 100 , 000 × g , GFP was detected in the insoluble pellet consisting of membranes , cell walls , and other insoluble cell components , but it was excluded from the supernatant ( Fig . S9 A , step 1 ) . The GFP - positive fraction was then separated via a series of sucrose steps and linear density gradient ultracentrifugations ( Fig . S9 ) . The maximum GFP signal was found to be associated with one fraction of ca . 60 % sucrose density ( Fig . S9 A , step 3 ) . TEM examination of this fraction demonstrated that it consisted of broken membranes and small membrane - bounded vesicles . Immunogold labeling showed that some membranes and vesicles in this preparation were positive for GFP ( Fig . 4 A ) and MC - like protein ( Fig . 4 B ) . The association of GFP and MC - like protein with fractionated membranes from lysed cells is consistent with the invariable association of GFP with membranes in the par - yphoplasm of sectioned G . obscuriglobus cells . It is unlikely that properly folded GFP could pass through a membrane pore be - cause the size limit for molecules that can enter via bacterial membrane pores is much smaller [ e . g . , 600 Da for E . coli ( 28 ) ] . It is also unlikely that GFP could pass through a membrane pore as an unfolded polypeptide because ( i ) this protein forms a highly stable structure of 30 – 40 Å diameter that is resistant to unfolding owing to a high folding / unfolding energy barrier ( 27 , 29 ) , and ( ii ) cytoplasmic components for protein secretion and / or associated ribosomal machinery are not present in the external milieu . However , to exclude the possibility of uptake of unfolded GFP through a membrane pore , we incubated G . obscuriglobus with a cross - linked protein ( mouse IgG ) that is expected to retain much of its tertiary structure during the uptake . This experiment demonstrated that the cross - linked protein was taken up by G . obscuriglobus and that it colocalized with MC - like protein in the same step gradient membrane fraction ( Fig . S10 ) . TEM of negatively stained fractions demonstrated their purity ( Fig . S11 ) . In summary , the observed results are compatible with an endocytosis - like mechanism but not with a channel - mediated mechanism in which unfolding of proteins is needed for import . An endocytosis - like mechanism is also consistent with our immunogold labeling results showing both GFP protein and MC A 2 3 4 V V V 2 4 3 1 V D V 3 2 2 1 3 C B Fig . 3 .

Implications for Evolution . Receptor - mediated endocytosis is uni - versal among eukaryotes : it has been established in animal cells ( 30 , 31 ) , plant cells ( 32 ) , fungi ( 33 ) , and protozoa ( 34 ) . Our dis - covery of a similar mechanism in a bacterium is of major signi ﬁ - cance to understanding evolution of cell complexity . There are two major types of hypotheses concerning the origin of eukaryote cell organization and its endomembranes . One postulates an an - cient endosymbiosis involving archaea and bacteria , another proposes an autogenous origin involving internal membrane in - vagination and digestion of engulfed material ( 1 , 35 , 36 ) . Our ﬁ nding of an endocytosis - like process in a bacterium provides support for the latter possibility . On the basis of our ﬁ ndings , an evolutionary scenario of au - togenous endomembrane system development can be considered in which endocytosis may have ﬁ rst evolved before eukaryote separation as a distinct lineage . That is consistent with phyloge - netic studies indicating that many components needed for endo - cytosis must have evolved before the LECA ( 3 ) . Development of endocytosis could have been followed by or be simultaneous with development of an endomembrane sorting system correlated with formation of the nucleus . If the evolution of endocytosis predated the formation of the three Domains , retention of such a system might have occurred only in Domain Eucarya members and some isolated phyla in Bacteria . In this view , planctomycete endocytosis may represent a related process conserved in both eukaryotes and some bacteria during evolution from a common ancestor . Endocytosis as found in planctomycetes may also be an ex - ample of a parallel evolutionary development of an analog of the eukaryote process . Evolution of a eukaryote - like cell plan may have occurred more than once from this point of view . The event which gave rise to the compartmentalized planctomycete cell plan enabling endocytosis - like abilities could be unrelated to eukaryote evolution in a direct phylogenetic sense . Planctomy - cete compartmentalization and endocytosis - like processes are nevertheless signi ﬁ cant for models of eukaryote origins , because their occurrence makes it unnecessary to invoke endosymbiosis between an archaeon and a bacterium to explain eukaryogenesis . The possibility of horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) events as an explanation for endocytosis in a bacterium is not excluded and would be somewhat consistent with evidence that eukaryote genes of signi ﬁ cance to cell biology ( e . g . , actin and pro ﬁ lin ) have ap - parently been transferred to bacteria over evolutionary time ( 37 ) . However , given the high complexity of the endocytotic system , it seems unlikely that HGT from eukaryotes is responsible for this phenomenon in G . obscuriglobus ; the possibility of recent HGT is unlikely on the basis of codon usage and GC content ( 23 ) . The remoteness of the detected homology of Gemmata MC - like proteins and eukaryote MC proteins including clathrins , distant enough to be revealed only by secondary and tertiary structure , is also consistent with the improbability of HGT as an explanation . It is also signi ﬁ cant for consideration of potential origins of an endomembrane system that G . obscuriglobus possesses an analog of the eukaryote nucleus , because the nuclear envelope is formed from endoplasmic reticulum in metazoans and most likely in other eukaryotes . In view of our ﬁ ndings with planctomycetes , an endomembrane system and compartmentalized cell organization in an ancestral protoeukaryote could have developed without the need for con - tributions from cells of other Domains of life . Our results imply that fusion between Archaea and Bacteria is not necessary to account for complex cell structure ; internal membrane systems could have developed within a simple cell and without in - volvement of fusion of unrelated cells . G . obscuriglobus may be viewed as a snapshot of a possible stage in the autogenous origin of eukaryotes . This bacterium may exhibit an ancestral stage in the evolution of endocytosis and represent a unique in vivo model for a major stage in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell . The nature and extent of the endocytotic machinery in this organism should now be investigated at both structural and functional levels . Materials and Methods Material .

GST was expressed from expression vector pGEX - KG ( 1 ) and puri ﬁ ed by af ﬁ nity chromatography on a glutathione - agarose col - umn according to the manufacturer ’ s instruction ( Scienti ﬁ x ) . Mouse monoclonal anti - GFP IgG ( Roche ; catalog no . 11814460 - 001 ) was used for dot - blots , Western blots , protein degradation , and protein cross - linking experiments , as an immunochemically detectable molecule for uptake . Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti - mouse antibody ( Molecular Probes ) was used as secondary antibody . DQ Green BSA was obtained from Invitrogen . DQ Green BSA Proteolysis Experiment . CellswereincubatedwithDQ Green BSA ( DQBSA ; 0 . 02 μ g / μ L ) in incubation buffer ( IB ) for 3 h and washed once with IB . The pellet was then resuspended in IB containing IgG - Cy3 ( 0 . 02 μ g / μ L ) , and cells were incubated for a further hour . After washing once and resuspending in IB , cells were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) . For control experiments ( see Insets ) , DQBSA ( 0 . 02 μ g / μ L ) in IB was incubated with 0 . 002 μ g / μ L of trypsin ( positive control ) or without trypsin ( negative control ) for 1 h , and solutions were ex - amined by CLSM with the same settings as used for monitoring DQBSA in Gemmata obscuriglobus cells . Fractionation Experiments . Cells were collected from two to three M1 - agar plates , washed once , and resuspended in 500 μ L of bt - DMSO buffer [ 10 mM bis - Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 20 % DMSO ] supplemented with 10 μ L of protease inhibitor mix ( Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set 3 ; Merck ) , 10 μ g of DNase , and 10 μ gofRNase . Cellswerethensonicated usingaBransonSoni ﬁ er 250 , andunbrokencells werespundowninamicrofugeat5 , 000 × g for 10 min . Supernatant was centrifuged at 100 , 000 × g in a Beck - man Coulter tabletop ultracentrifuge ( Optima TLX ) . The pellet was resuspended in 500 μ L of bt - DMSO buffer , loaded onto a ﬁ ve - step sucrose gradient ( Fig . S9 ) , and centrifuged in an SW60 rotor on a Beckman Coulter L8 - 60M ultracentrifuge at 215 , 000 × g for 4h . Fractionswerecollectedfromthebottomofthetube , andeach of them contained ≈ 500 μ L of material . Five microliters from each fraction were used for dot - blot analysis for presence of GFP . Fraction 3 ( positive for GFP ) was centrifuged using the same rotor and ultracentrifuge at 100 , 000 × g , and the pellet resuspended in 500 μ L of bt - DMSO was loaded onto a 20 – 60 % sucrose / bt - DMSO gradient . After centrifugation using the same rotor and centrifuge for 16 h at 215 , 000 × g , fractions were collected from the top ( ≈ 400 μ L each ) . GFP - positive fraction 10 from the 20 – 60 % su - crose / bt - DMSO gradient was used as a load material for a 40 – 70 % sucrose / bt - DMSO gradient centrifugation using the same con - ditions . This fractionation was performed in a similar way as the previous step . A schematic diagram of the fractionation experi - ments is presented in Fig . S9 A . Quality of fractionation experi - ments was monitored by transmission electron microscopy using uranyl acetate - stained samples ( Fig . S11 ) . Saturation Experiment . The experiment was carried out in three replicates using the same batch of G . obscuriglobus cells . Cells were grown on plates and prepared as described for experiments testing GFP uptake in the main text ( Materials and Methods ) . G . obscuriglobus cells were resuspended in 850 μ L of IB and ali - quoted into eight Eppendorf tubes , each containing 100 μ L of cell suspension . IB ( 1 . 9 mL ) containing different concentrations of GFP was added to cell suspensions to reach a ﬁ nal concentration of GFP ranging from 2 to 40 μ g / mL ( Fig . S2 ) . Samples were con - tinuously mixed on a vertical rotating wheel . After 2 h of in - cubation at 28 °C , samples were immediately cooled on ice and centrifuged for 2 min at 5 °C at maximum speed ( 20 , 000 × g ) . After careful removal of the supernatant , cells were resuspended in 200 μ L of ice - cold IB and centrifuged again . The supernatant was re - moved , and cells were resuspended in 100 μ L of ice - cold IB . The cells were transferred into a black 96 - well plate ( Greiner Cellstar ) , and GFP ﬂ uorescence was measured using a ﬂ uorescence plate reader , POLARStar OPTIMA ( Imgen Technologies ) ( excitation ﬁ lter set to A - 405 , emission ﬁ lter set to 520 ) . Competition Experiment . The experiment was carried out in three replicates using the same batch of G . obscuriglobus cells . Cells grown on plates were resuspended in 350 μ L of IB and aliquoted in three Eppendorf tubes , each containing 100 μ L of cell suspen - sion . One of the aliquots was not incubated with GFP and served to monitor the ﬂ uorescence background . GFP ( 10 μ g / mL ) alone , GFP ( 10 μ g / mL ) and ovalbumin ( 100 μ g / mL ) , or GFP ( 10 μ g / mL ) and GST ( 100 μ g / mL ) were added to cell suspensions , and samples were continuously mixed on a vertical rotating wheel . After 90 min of incubation at 28 °C , samples were immediately cooled on ice . The samples were then centrifuged and treated in the same way as for the saturation experiment . The reported ﬂ uorescence data were obtained by subtracting background values corresponding to auto ﬂ uorescence of cells . TestingProteolysisofMouseIgG ( Anti - GFPAntibody ) in G . obscuriglobus Cells . Cells grown on plates were resuspended in 350 μ L of IB containing 1 μ g / mL of mouse IgG . After 1 h incubation at 28 °C , cells were washed three times with 1 mL of IB buffer and re - suspended in 350 μ L of IB buffer . Aliquots of 100 μ L were sam - pled immediately after resuspension and after 2 h and 16 h in - cubation at 28 °C . Incubation was terminated by cooling on ice . Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 50 μ L of SDS / PAGE loading buffer , and the lysate was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel . Proteins contained in 10 μ L of each sample were resolved by SDS / PAGE ( 4 – 20 % gradient gel ) and characterized by Western blot analysis using Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti - mouse antibody ( Molecular Probes ) . Detection was performed by using an Od - yssey infrared imaging system ( Li - COR ) . Cross - Linking of Mouse IgG ( Anti - GFP Antibody ) and Testing Uptake of Cross - Linked Ig . Mouse IgG ( 20 μ g ) was incubated in 100 μ L of 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , containing 1 % formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature . Formaldehyde solution was then substituted with 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , using Vivaspin 500 concentrators ( 3 kDa exclusion limit ; GE Healthcare ) . Cells grown on plates ( G . obscuriglobus or Escherichiacoli ) were resuspended in50 μ Lof IB containing ≈ 5 μ g / mL of cross - linked mouse IgG . After 1 h of incubation at 28 °C , cells were washed three times with 0 . 5 mL of IB buffer and resuspended in 50 μ L of SDS / PAGE loading buffer . The samples were resuspended in sample buffer without mer - captoethanol and loaded onto the SDS / PAGE gel , without heat - ing , so as not to disrupt formaldehyde - linked bonds . Proteins were resolved by SDS / PAGE ( 4 – 20 % gradient gel ) and characterized by Western blot analysis using Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti - mouse antibody ( Molecular Probes ) . Detection was performed by using an Odyssey infrared imaging system ( Li - COR ) . Mass Spectrometry . Anti - GFP IgG treated with or without formal - dehyde was digested overnight with trypsin ( 1 : 25 ) in 25 mM ammo - nium bicarbonate .

Alignment and secondary structure comparison of gp4978 and yeast clathrin heavy chain ( Uniprot ID : P22137 - CLH _ YEAST ) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Protein pro ﬁ les were aligned with the hhalign program available from the HHPred package ( 1 ) . Secondary structures ( α - helices and β - strands ) were predicted with the PSI - PRED program ( 2 ) and are represented as pink cylinders ( α - helices ) and cyan arrows ( β - strands ) above and below the aligned sequences , respectively . Where regions containing either β - sheets or α - helices conform to domains corresponding to β - propellor or α - solenoid domains , the predicted ( for gp4978 ) and known ( for clathrin ) domains of these β - propellers and α - solenoids are highlighted by a gray shading of the secondary structures . Fig . S8 Fig . S9 . GFP cofractionates with membrane coat ( MC ) - like protein gp4978 . ( A ) Diagram of fractionation of G . obscuriglobus cells preincubated with GFP . G . obscuriglobus cells were sonicated , and the insoluble material was separated by differential centrifugation ( step 1 ) . The insoluble material from step 1 was further fractionated via sucrose density gradient centrifugations ( steps 2 , 3 , and 4 ) . Dot - blots from successive fractionations were performed with mouse IgG to detect GFP - positive fractions . A Western blot with mouse IgG was carried out to con ﬁ rm the dot - blot results of the last fractionation ( step 4 ) . As an example a Western blot with fractions 2 and 9 is shown ; M , molecular mass marker . Con ﬁ rming dot - blot results , GFP was present in fraction 9 and largely absent in fraction 2 . ( B ) Dot - blot and Western blot of fractions from the 40 – 70 % sucrose density gradient centrifugation run corresponding to step 4 , using anti - gp4978 antibody . Western blot result shows a reacting band of ≈ 125 kDa corresponding to the expected length of the MC - like protein gp4978 . Fig . S9 Fig . S6 . Internalized proteins colocalize in G . obscuriglobus cells . CLSM of G . obscuriglobus cells incubated with mixtures of both Cy5 - labeled streptavidin and GFP or Cy3 - labeled Ig and GFP , at equimolar concentrations ( 10 μ g protein / mL ) . Cy5 - labeled streptavidin and GFP ( Upper ) or Cy3 - labeled Ig and GFP ( Lower ) were coincubated with G . obscuriglobus cells for 1 h at 28 °C . Streptavidin - Cy5 and IgG - Cy3 indicate the signals for Cy5 and Cy3 only , GFP indicates signal for GFP ﬂ uorescence , and “ merge ” indicates merger of both Cy5 and GFP or Cy3 and GFP signals , respectively ; the merge images show colocalization of the corresponding proteins .

Transmission electron micrographs of negatively stained preparations of fractions from density gradient centrifugations . Fraction 7 ( Top ) from the step gradient ( negative for reaction with anti - GFP antibody via Western blot ) contains mostly ﬂ agella as well as membranous debris ; fraction 9 ( Middle ) from the 20 – 60 % continuous gradient ( negative for reaction with anti - GFP antibody via Western blot ) contains mainly membrane sheets covered with characteristic pore - like structures ; fraction 10 ( Bottom ) from the 20 – 60 % continuous gradient ( positive for reaction with anti - GFP antibody via Western blot ) contains mostly membrane vesicles and small pieces of broken membranes . When this fraction 10 was further subjected to another sucrose density gradient fractionation ( 30 – 70 % ) it resulted in only one visible band , corresponding to fraction 9 positive for anti - GFP antibody reactivity .
