138 VOLUME 12 NUMBER 2 FEBRUARY 2005 NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY The yeast DASH complex forms closed rings on microtubules JJ L Miranda 1 , Peter De Wulf 2 , Peter K Sorger 2 , 3 & Stephen C Harrison 4 The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DASH complex is an essential microtubule - binding component of the kinetochore . We coexpressed all ten subunits of this assembly in Escherichia coli and purified a single complex , a ∼ 210 - kDa heterodecamer with an apparent stoichiometry of one copy of each subunit . The hydrodynamic properties of the recombinant assembly are indistinguishable from those of the native complex in yeast extracts . The structure of DASH alone and bound to microtubules was visualized by EM . The free heterodecamer is relatively globular . In the presence of microtubules , DASH oligomerizes to form rings and paired helices that encircle the microtubules . We discuss potential roles for such collar - like structures in maintaining microtubule attachment and spindle integrity during chromosome segregation . Chromosome segregation requires the attachment of spindle microtu - bules ( MTs ) to kinetochores , multiprotein complexes that assemble on centromeric DNA . Faithful segregation also requires that sister chroma - tids establish bipolar MT attachments in which one kinetochore binds a MT emanating from one spindle pole and the sister kinetochore binds a MT emanating from the opposite pole . Kinetochores remain bound to the ends of growing and shrinking MTs and can transduce energy released by MT depolymerization into pulling forces . Bipolar kineto - chore - MT attachment imposes sufficient tension on sister chromatids to stretch centromeric chromatin during metaphase and disjoin chro - matids at anaphase . Kinetochore architecture is best understood in the budding yeast S . cerevisiae , which has the smallest known centromeres . Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochores contain 60 or more protein subunits organized into at least 14 distinct multiprotein complexes 1 . The entire assembly forms a bridge between the DNA of a centromere and a single spindle MT . Dam1p , a MT - binding component of yeast kinetochores that also localizes to spindle MTs 2 – 5 , is part of a ten - protein complex , variously called Dam1 complex or DASH , which also contains Duo1p , Dad1p , Dad2p , Spc19p , Spc34p , Ask1p , Dad3p , Dad4p and Hsk3p 6 – 10 . All ten are essential proteins . Mutations in DASH subunits prevent the for - mation and maintenance of bipolar kinetochore - MT attachments 7 , 11 and destabilize the spindle 2 – 10 , 12 . Ipl1p , a spindle assembly checkpoint kinase required for resolving syntelic kinetochore - MT attachments formed early in mitosis 13 , seems to regulate association of DASH with other kinetochore complexes 9 , 14 , suggesting a possible mechanism for the establishment of bipolarity . DASH isolated from yeast binds MTs 6 . Understanding how it does so may help explain how kinetochores attach to the spindle and how these attachments are maintained during rounds of MT polymerization and depolymerization . We have produced DASH by recombinant methods in E . coli and examined its structural properties using EM . We find that DASH forms a ring - like structure that encircles MTs . This collar might be one component of a proposed sleeve that has been suggested on theoretical grounds as a means by which kinetochores could hold onto dynamic MTs 15 . RESULTSRecombinant coexpression Attempts to express individual components of DASH in E . coli as soluble proteins for reconstitution were largely unsuccessful . Rather than conducting refolding experiments , we attempted coexpression of the entire complex . A modular approach using a polycistronic vector has been successful for coexpression of the three - protein VHL – elongin C – elongin B complex from one bacterial plasmid 16 . To accommodate the ten subunits of DASH , we enhanced that system by constructing new vectors that increase the capacity of each polycistron to five open reading frames ( ORFs ) and allow the transcription of two messages from one plasmid . One of the ten subunits was fused to a C - terminal His 6 - tag to facilitate purification . All ten subunits were coexpressed from one vector ( Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) , and the resulting assembly was purified by metal affinity , ion exchange , and gel filtration chromatography . Escherichia coli DnaK , a common chaperone contaminant in bacteria 17 , binds to the complex during purification , and a competitor peptide 18 was added at multiple steps in the preparation to release the chaperone . We obtained ∼ 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 mg of purified DASH from each liter of bacterial culture . Purified , recombinant DASH is a heterodecamer containing the ten expressed proteins ( Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) .

Substoichiometric bands , one below Duo1p and two below Dad1p , were identified by mass spectrometry as degradation products of components of the complex . Coexpression of all ten subunits seems necessary for formation of complex . For example , in the absence of Hsk3p , two separate subcomplexes form , one comprising Ask1p , Dad2p and Dad4p , and the other comprising Dad1p , Dad3p , Dam1p , Duo1p , Spc19p and Spc34p ( data not shown ) . All results presented here were obtained with DASH containing His 6 - tagged Spc34p , but these were reproduced with preparations containing a His 6 - tag on different com - ponent proteins ( data not shown ) . Heterodecamer characterization To compare recombinant and native DASH , we carried out size - exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity ultracentrifuga - tion with our purified preparations and whole - cell yeast extracts side by side ( Fig . 1 ) . Fractionation of DASH was traced by western hybridization using antibodies generated against Spc34p and Hsk3p . Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and gel filtration chromatography indi - cate a tendency for recombinant DASH to aggregate in a concentration - , salt - , and pH - dependent manner ( data not shown ) , but aggregation could be reduced substantially at dilute concentrations . At ∼ 1 – 10 µ M , the diffusion coefficient , 2 . 8 ± 0 . 1 × 10 – 7 cm 2 s – 1 , and sedimentation coefficient , 7 . 4 ± 0 . 3 × 10 – 13 , of the complex yield a calculated molec - ular mass of 211 ± 16 kDa , consistent with the predicted molecular mass of 204 kDa , assuming one copy of each subunit and one His 6 - tag . The Stokes radius of 76 ± 2 Å is larger than 40 and 50 Å , the ideal minimum and experi - mentally expected radii , respectively , for a 200 - kDa protein . The calculated frictional coefficient of 1 . 90 ± 0 . 03 suggests either an elongated shape or the presence of unstruc - tured extensions . The hydrodynamic proper - ties of the recombinant and native complexes were indistinguishable , arguing that recombi - nant DASH is similar to the complex present in vivo . EM of rotary shadowed recombinant DASH revealed the presence of globular species , often oblong rather than circular , and sometimes tri - angular ( Fig . 2 ) . Each particle is ∼ 170 ± 20 Å ( n = 116 ) in diameter without correction for the platinum - carbon grain size , which we esti - mate as 20 Å on all sides . Thus , EM and hydro - dynamic measurements yield similar diameters for the complex , 130 and 150 Å , respectively . Both techniques show that the heterodecamer is relatively globular in solution . Microtubule decoration Recombinant DASH cosediments with paclitaxel - stabilized MTs ( Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) , and the decorated MTs have a characteristic appearance when visualized by negative staining EM . Whereas MTs alone appear as ∼ 250 Å – wide fibers ( Fig . 3a ) , MTs decorated with DASH have prominent trans - verse striations ( Fig . 3b ) . The striations are more or less perpendicular to the MT axis , although the tilt of successive striations varies slightly , as does axial spacing . Each striation appears as a continuously contrasted mass , 50 ± 10 Å ( n = 117 from seven MTs ) thick and 480 ± 30 Å ( n = 267 from ten MTs ) in diameter . The striations extend 110 ± 10 Å ( n = 267 from ten MTs ) beyond the MT on each side . Their diameter varies slightly , depending on the degree of MT flattening , and perhaps on the number of MT protofilaments and the angle relative to the MT axis . The termination points of striations are not seen , arguing against the binding of extended , linear species to MTs . Thus , the observed bands represent the projection of either a closed circular ring or a filamentous helix . Figure 1 Hydrodynamic analysis of recombinant and native DASH .

At a 1 : 10 molar ratio of DASH to tubulin heterodi - mer , isolated striations could be observed ( Fig . 4a ) . In certain cases , the contrasted structure could be followed along the edge of a MT and even around its complete circumference , revealing a single closed ring . The radial thickness of the ring appeared to be similar to the thickness of the striations perpendicular to the MT axis , leaving ∼ 60 Å between the outer diameter of the MT and the inner diameter of the ring . Negative stain did not reveal any clear mass of protein directly bridging the MT and the ring . Based on the diameter of the ring and the dimensions of the heterodecamer obtained by hydrodynamic analysis and rotary shad - owing measurements , we estimate that the number of heterodecamers required to fully encircle a MT is between 10 and 15 . MTs polymerized in vitro under our conditions predominantly contain 13 – 15 protofila - ments , and MTs in vivo contain 13 protofilaments . The actual binding stoichiometry could therefore correspond to one heterodecamer per MT protofilament . Adjacent striations tend to pair with similar tilts relative to the MT axis when the MT is saturated with DASH . Examination of decorated MTs at equimolar concentrations of DASH and tubulin heterodimer sometimes reveals the presence of paired helices , a structural variation of a ring ( Fig . 4b ) . The path of these helices could also be traced around the circumference of the MT . The spacing between paired strands is 100 ± 10 Å ( n = 69 from 13 helical stretches on 9 MTs ) , slightly longer than the spacing corresponding to the tubulin heterodimer repeat , and the helical pitch is 250 ± 20 Å ( n = 13 helical stretches from 9 MTs ) . Tubulin itself can form both rings and spirals around MTs in the presence of polycations 19 – 22 . Immunogold labeling experiments show that the decoration we observe is indeed DASH , not tubulin . We used a monoclonal primary antibody specific for the C - terminal His 6 - tag , which was on Spc34p . In the presence of this antibody , protein A con - jugated to 5 - nm gold particles localized specifically to rings on the MTs ( Fig . 5a ) , and undecorated MTs remained unlabeled . We also observed frequent pairing of rings in this experiment , a result consistent with crosslinking by bivalent antibodies . In the absence of primary antibody , we detected no selective gold localization ( Fig . 5b ) . Figure 3 Decoration of MTs with DASH .

DISCUSSIONMode of microtubule binding We have shown that DASH is a relatively globular heterodecamer in solution that oligomerizes in the presence of MTs to form closed rings and paired helices that encircle the MTs ( Fig . 6 ) . Rings and helices do not form in the absence of MTs , suggesting that MT binding is neces - sary for ring and helix formation and that the MTs template or seed this assembly . Rings form even at low molar ratios of DASH relative to tubulin , suggesting that ring formation is cooperative , with comple - tion of a ring being more favorable than initiation of a new ring . MT encirclement by DASH is distinct from the modes of binding observed for other MT - associated proteins . MAP2 and tau contain three or four intramolecular repeats of a MT - binding motif that bind to successive tubulin heterodimers longitudinally along a protofilament 23 . In the case of kinesin - like proteins , each motor domain binds a single tubulin het - erodimer 24 , but kinesin dimers span adjacent tubulin heterodimers , also longitudinally along a protofilament 25 . MAP2 , tau and kinesin do not oligomerize laterally to form closed rings or filaments . In negatively stained preparations , there is a gap between the MT and DASH rings or helices that is not spanned by any strongly con - trasted structure . Flattening of the decorated MT may artificially enhance this property , but we find that the diameters of striations observed on MTs in vitreous ice , where flattening does not occur , is similar ( data not shown ) . The lack of a large contact area may be explained by a binding interface consisting of extensions of a flexible peptide rather than a globular domain . Such extensions might not be detected in images of negatively stained samples . DASH decorates subtilisin - cleaved MTs in a manner similar to untreated MTs ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the flexible C termini of tubulin subunits are not essential for binding . The binding interface may thus consist A R T I C L E S © 2005 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n s m b NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VOLUME 12 NUMBER 2 FEBRUARY 2005 141 of extended polypeptide projecting from DASH associated with the globular core of tubulin . Formation of both rings and helices by DASH on MTs is consistent with a ring - to - lockwasher transition as seen in some symmetrical , oligomeric assemblies . The helicase domain of the bacteriophage T7 helicase - primase crystallizes as both a hexameric ring with P 6 symmetry and a helical filament with P 6 1 symmetry 26 , 27 . The GTPase dynamin self - assembles into oligomers of both rings and helices in vitro 28 . In the case of DASH , helices represent a propagated , ordered state of the ring , but are only observed at high binding stoichiometry in vitro . The lack of obvious contacts between adjacent rings and the observation of single rings at low molar ratios of DASH relative to tubulin suggest that the ring is the basic architectural unit of the assembly on MTs . Genome - wide analysis of yeast protein abundance estimates the copy number of seven DASH components at ∼ 1 , 000 per cell 29 , and our own quantitative western blotting experiments calibrated by protein A yield an estimated 650 ± 50 copies of TAP - tagged Dam1p per cell , corre - sponding to ∼ 1 µ M ( data not shown ) . At this concentration , an average of one or two rings could form on each of the 32 kinetochore MTs and 8 interpolar MTs in haploid yeast . This arithmetic suggests that helices are unlikely to form in vivo , and we therefore propose that rings are the biologically functional unit of DASH assembly on MTs . Implications for kinetochore function Loss of functional DASH prevents kinetochores from forming and maintaining stable bipolar attachments to MTs , and destabilizes the spindle . Imaging of yeast cells show the complex primarily at kineto - chores , with some additional localization on part of the spindle 11 . If each MT contains only one or two rings , however , DASH cannot function by coating the length of the MT . Instead , DASH may func - tion primarily at the ( + ) - ends of MTs . MAP2 and tau are thought to protect MTs against depolymerization by bridging tubulin subunits longitudinally and stabilizing the straight form of the protofilament , thus preventing the transition to the curved , depolymerizing form 23 . Doublecortin is thought to stabilize interactions both longitudinally between tubulin monomers and laterally between protofilaments by providing additional contacts in a fenestration between four tubulin monomers 30 . DASH may function similarly by encircling MTs and laterally bridging protofilaments , thereby stabilizing interprotofila - ment association and constraining the bending and splaying that occurs at depolymerizing ends . The presence of a ring - like structure at the kinetochore has implica - tions for the mechanism of kinetochore - MT attachment . During meta - phase and anaphase , kinetochores must remain bound to the ( + ) - ends of dynamic MTs , a process that is topologically challenging . The pres - ence of a sleeve has been proposed previously as a mechanical solution for this problem 15 . DASH collars at the kinetochore could be part of such a sleeve . Because depolymerization at the MT ( + ) - end proceeds by protofilament splaying , a ring will be retained on the MT and induced to slide longitudinally , ensuring sustained attachment and helping to couple depolymerization to translation . In DNA metabolism , protein rings that slide along DNA confer processivity to different functions that require prolonged tracking 31 . The ring - like structures provide a topological link with DNA , maintaining attachment even as DNA is polymerized , unwound or depolymerized . The same structural solution may have evolved for the problem of MT attachment . In the absence of a stable MT collar , kinetochores might retain their ability to capture MTs , but attachment would be weaker and subject to breakage . Mutations in DASH subunits indeed produce such effects in vivo . METHODS Plasmids . A modular system for coexpression of four proteins in bacteria from a single polycistron 16 was modified to coexpress ten proteins from two polycistrons on the same plasmid . The sequence GAGCTCCAATTGGAATTCGCTAGC was inserted between the MluI and XbaI sites of pET21a + ( Novagen ) to generate pET21aTr . This new transfer vector allows insertion of a fifth ORF between the MluI and XhoI sites of pST39 . The sequence GACCTGCTAGCATGACTGGTG GACAGAAATGGGTCTGCAGCG was inserted into the RsrII site of pST39 to generate pST39Dual . This plasmid serves as the new backbone for coexpression . One polycistron containing five ORFs from pST39 may be inserted as a NsiI - SpeI fragment into the new PstI and NheI sites . A second polycistron containing another five ORFs from a different pST39 plasmid may then be inserted between the original NsiI and SpeI sites . The two polycistrons are antiparallel to one another and under the control of separate T7 promoters and terminators . Cloning . DASH component genes were cloned from S . cerevisiae W303 and inserted into PCR4Blunt - TOPO ( Invitrogen ) with flanking NdeI and BamHI sites . Silent mutations were introduced to remove internal NdeI and BamHI sites using the QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) , and all genes were subcloned into pET3aTr as NdeI - BamHI fragments . Additional mutagenesis to remove restriction sites necessary for further subcloning was carried out in pET3aTr . ASK1 and HSK3 were subcloned into pET21aTr as NdeI - BamHI frag - ments . One polycistron was constructed as follows : DAD4 , DAD3 and DAD2 were sequentially subcloned from pET3aTr into the compatible restriction sites of the first three cassettes in pST39 as NheI - BamHI , EcoRI - HindIII , and SacI - KpnI Figure 5 Immunogold labeling of MTs decorated with DASH .

SPC19 from pET3aTr as a BspEI - MluI fragment and ASK1 from pET21aTr as a MluI - XhoI fragment were inserted into BspEI - XhoI - digested pST39 containing DAD4 , DAD3 and DAD2 . The second polycistron was constructed in a similar fashion . DAD1 was subcloned from pET3aTr into the first cassette of pST39 as a XbaI - BamHI fragment . DUO1 was subcloned from pET3aTr to the second cassette of a different pST39 plasmid as a MfeI - HindIII fragment , and then inserted as a BsrGI - HindIII fragment into BsrGI - HindIII - digested pST39 containing DAD1 . SPC34 was subcloned from pET3aTr into the third cassette of pST39 containing DAD1 and DUO1 as a SacI - KpnI fragment . DAM1 from pET3aTr as a BspEI - BssHII fragment and HSK3 from pET21aTr as a MluI - XhoI fragment were inserted into BspEI - XhoI - digested pST39 containing DAD1 , DUO1 , and SPC34 . The DAD4 / DAD3 / DAD2 / SPC19 / ASK1 polycistron was inserted into NheI - PstI - digested pST39Dual as a NsiI - SpeI fragment . The DAD1 / DUO1 / SPC34 / DAM1 / HSK3 poycistron was inserted as a NsiI - SpeI frag - ment into NsiI - SpeI - digested pST39Dual containing the other polycistron . This procedure was repeated to generate similar plasmids with ASK1 , DAD1 , DAD2 , DAD3 , DAD4 , HSK3 , SPC19 and SPC34 encoding a C - terminal His 6 - tag . Expression and purification . Coexpression plasmids were transformed into E . coli BL21 - AI ( Invitrogen ) harboring the pRARE plasmid ( Novagen ) and grown for 3 – 5 h at 37 ° C after induction with 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) arabinose at an A 600 of 0 . 4 . Cells were lysed in 50 mM phosphate , 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , 5 mM mercap - toethanol , 1 mM PMSF and Complete protease inhibitors without EDTA ( Roche ) , pH 7 . 5 . The supernatant was bound to Ni - NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) , washed in the same buffer without protease inhibitors , and eluted with 200 mM imidazole . The eluant was exchanged into 50 mM phosphate , 25 mM NaCl , 1 mM mercapto - ethanol , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 5 by concentration . ATP was added to 1 mM and the synthetic peptide NRLLLTG was added to 250 - fold molar excess relative to the DASH . The mixture was incubated for 1 h and purified on a MonoQ 5 / 50 column ( Amersham ) with a gradient of 25 – 415 mM NaCl . The eluant was concentrated , mixed with ATP and the NRLLLTG peptide again , and purified on a Superose 6 10 / 300 column ( Amersham ) equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM mercaptoethanol , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 . All steps were carried out at 4 ° C . Antibody production . pET3aTr plasmids containing SPC34 or HSK3 encoding a C - terminal His 6 - tag were transformed into E . coli BL21 - AI ( Invitrogen ) harbor - ing the pRARELysS plasmid ( Novagen ) and grown as described above . Cells were lysed in the same buffer supplemented with 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 . The pellet was washed three times in buffer without protease inhibitors and redissolved in buffer with 6 M guanidine substituting for 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 . The supernatant was bound to Ni - NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) , washed in the same buffer , and eluted with 200 mM imidazole . The eluant was injected into rabbits for the production of polyclonal antibodies ( Covance ) . Hydrodynamic analysis . Size - exclusion chromatography was carried out on a HiPrep 16 / 60 Sephacryl S - 500 HR column ( Amersham ) equilibrated in 100 mM bis - tris - propane , 150 mM KCl , 10 mM EDTA , 50 mM β - glycerophosphate , pH 7 . 5 at 4 ° C . Calibration was done with the known diffusion constants 32 , 33 of thyroglobulin , ferritin , catalase , aldolase and albumin ( Amersham , Boehringer Mannheim ) . Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303 was grown in YPD to an A 600 of 1 . 0 – 1 . 2 , spun down , and ground in liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle 34 . Total cell extract protein ( 500 µ g ) or recombinant DASH ( 750 ng ) was loaded onto the column . Fractions of 1 ml were collected , precipitated with 1 M trichloroacetic acid , rinsed with acetone , and examined by western blotting using 1 : 750 dilutions of polyclonal anti - Spc34p or anti - Hsk3p . Sedimentation velocity ultracentrifuga - tion was done with a 10 % – 40 % ( v / v ) 5 - ml glycerol density gradient made in size - exclusion buffer and layered in 13 × 51 mm open - top Polyclear centrifuge tubes ( Seton Scientific ) using the Biocomp Gradient Master ( Biocomp Instruments ) . Yeast extract was made as described above , and 150 µ g total cell extract protein or 750 ng recombinant DASH was loaded onto the gradient . The gradients were centrifuged at 370 , 000 g for for 12 h at 4 ° C in a SW55Ti swinging bucket rotor and Optima L - 80 Ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Instruments ) . Fractionation was carried out robotically using a Biocomp Piston Gradient Fractionator ( Biocomp Instruments , version 5 . 60 ) by removing 20 fractions of 1 . 9 mm from the top . Calibration was done with the known sedimentation constants 35 of ribonuclease A , chymotrypsinogen A , ovalbumin , albumin , aldolase and catalase ( Amersham ) . The Stokes radius , molecular mass and frictional coefficient of DASH was deter - mined using the Stokes - Einstein equation . Microtubule decoration . Bovine tubulin ( Cytoskeleton ) was polymerized at 5 mg ml – 1 in 74 mM PIPES , 1 mM GTP , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 100 µ M paclitaxel , 5 – 7 . 5 % ( v / v ) DMSO , pH 6 . 9 for 30 min at 35 ° C . MTs were diluted to 0 . 055 mg ml – 1 in 25 mM HEPES , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM GTP , 10 µ M pacli - taxel , 1 % ( v / v ) DMSO , pH 7 . 4 . Binding was carried out by diluting 5 µ l of 1 mg ml – 1 DASH with 45 µ l of MT solution . Control samples were treated with buffer instead of DASH . All samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature . Partial decoration for observation of single rings was achieved by diluting the DASH concentration in the reaction ten - fold . Immunogold labeling was done by adding 0 . 3 µ l of 1 . 2 mg ml – 1 monoclonal anti - His ( C - terminal ) ( Invitrogen ) and 0 . 6 µ l of protein A conjugated with 5 - nm gold particles ( University of Utrecht ) at A 520 of 6 to partially decorated microtubules . Control samples were treated with buffer instead of monoclonal antibody . All samples were incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature . Electron microscopy . Negatively stained preparations were made by adsorbing decorated MTs onto freshly glow - discharged grids coated with parlodion and car - bon . In some cases with 0 . 1 mg ml – 1 DASH , the sample was spun at 18 , 000 g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in the same buffer before adsorption to reduce protein background . The grid was washed and stained with 0 . 7 % ( w / v ) uranyl formate . For rotary shadowing experiments , 0 . 1 to 0 . 5 mg ml – 1 DASH was diluted five - fold into 112 mM ammonium bicarbonate , 45 % ( v / v ) glycerol , pH 7 . 5 , sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica , dried , and shadowed with platinum . Images of negatively stained and rotary shadowed samples were obtained on a JOEL - 1200EX microscope operating at 80 kV with a nominal magnification of 30 , 000 × and 45 , 000 × , respectively . Measurements were taken on digitized negatives with distances calibrated by replica gratings ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) .
