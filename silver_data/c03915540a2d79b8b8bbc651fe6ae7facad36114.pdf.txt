OPEN ORIGINAL ARTICLE Genome - wide screen for differentially methylated long noncoding RNAs identi ﬁ es Esrp2 and lncRNA Esrp2 - as regulated by enhancer DNA methylation with prognostic relevance for human breast cancer K Heilmann , R Toth , C Bossmann , K Klimo , C Plass and C Gerhauser The majority of long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) is still poorly characterized with respect to function , interactions with protein - coding genes , and mechanisms that regulate their expression . As for protein - coding RNAs , epigenetic deregulation of lncRNA expression by alterations in DNA methylation might contribute to carcinogenesis . To provide genome - wide information on lncRNAs aberrantly methylated in breast cancer we pro ﬁ led tumors of the C3 ( 1 ) SV40TAg mouse model by MCIp - seq ( Methylated CpG Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing ) . This approach detected 69 lncRNAs differentially methylated between tumor tissue and normal mammary glands , with 26 located in antisense orientation of a protein - coding gene . One of the hypomethylated lncRNAs , 1810019D21Rik ( now called Esrp2 - antisense ( as ) ) was identi ﬁ ed in proximity to the epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 ( Esrp2 ) that is signi ﬁ cantly elevated in C3 ( 1 ) tumors . ESRPs were shown previously to have a dual role in carcinogenesis . Both gain and loss have been associated with poor prognosis in human cancers , but the mechanisms regulating expression are not known . In - depth analyses indicate that coordinate overexpression of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as inversely correlates with DNA methylation . Luciferase reporter gene assays support co - expression of Esrp2 and the major short Esrp2 - as variant from a bidirectional promoter , and transcriptional regulation by methylation of a proximal enhancer . Ultimately , this enhancer - based regulatory mechanism provides a novel explanation for tissue - speci ﬁ c expression differences and upregulation of Esrp2 during carcinogenesis . Knockdown of Esrp2 - as reduced Esrp2 protein levels without affecting mRNA expression and resulted in an altered transcriptional pro ﬁ le associated with extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , cell motility and reduced proliferation , whereas overexpression enhanced proliferation . Our ﬁ ndings not only hold true for the murine tumor model , but led to the identi ﬁ cation of an unannotated human homolog of Esrp2 - as which is signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in human breast cancer and associated with poor prognosis . Oncogene ( 2017 ) 36 , 6446 – 6461 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / onc . 2017 . 246 ; published online 31 July 2017 INTRODUCTION The importance of long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) for the regulation of both developmental as well as tumorigenic processes is increasingly recognized . LncRNAs in ﬂ uence expres - sion or stability of protein - coding RNAs , and act as hosting genes encoding for microRNAs or as microRNA decoys . 1 – 4 LncRNAs also affect translation and stability of proteins . 2 , 5 They can control expression of genes in a localized , gene - speci ﬁ c fashion 6 or by targeting large chromosomal regions . 1 – 4 LncRNAs in ﬂ uence DNA methylation or the chromatin landscape by interacting with modi ﬁ ers of epigenetic marks , thereby recruiting these modi ﬁ ers to speci ﬁ c DNA loci , and subsequent gene silencing or activation . 5 , 7 , 8 Identi ﬁ cation and functional evaluation of lncRNAs has become an area of substantial scienti ﬁ c interest , for example by analyzing differential expression for de novo identi ﬁ cation of lncRNAs . 9 , 10 In addition , information on chromatin marks for active transcrip - tion ( H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 ) was combined with tiling microarray data to locate novel lncRNAs . 11 RNA - seq allows the detection of lncRNAs at a genome - wide scale . 9 , 10 Elucidation of biological functions of lncRNAs is aided by bioinformatic strategies , for example , by analyzing the genomic context of the lncRNAs , or by placing them in a network of coexpressed genes . 10 Experimentally , immunoprecipitation of RNAs is used to detect interaction partners . 9 Despite these achievements in the discovery of novel lncRNAs , regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA expression are poorly understood , and especially genome - wide studies for epigenetic regulation of lncRNAs are still scarce . In the present study , we hypothesized that epigenetic dereg - ulation of lncRNA expression might contribute to carcinogenesis . We performed a genome - wide screen for differentially methylated lncRNA promoters in tumor samples of a mouse model for human breast cancer vs normal mammary tissue and identi ﬁ ed a series of candidate regions in antisense orientation to protein - coding genes . One of the hypomethylated lncRNAs was 1810019D21RIK ( termed Esrp2 - antisense ( as ) ) located in vicinity of the epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 ( Esrp2 ) , which was upregulated in C3 ( 1 ) tumors . ESRP2 and its closely related isoform ESRP1 are crucial to maintain an epithelial - speci ﬁ c RNA splicing program . Loss of these splicing factors leads to epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , 12 – 14 which is an important process involved in Division of Epigenomics and Cancer Risk Factors , German Cancer Research Center ( DKFZ ) , Heidelberg , Germany .

Both isoforms have been found up - or downregulated in human cancers , and both high and low expression levels were associated with poor prognosis . 17 – 19 We here report that coordinate expression of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as from a bidirectional promoter is regulated by differential methylation of a proximal enhancer . Knockdown and over - expression studies suggest that Esrp2 - as is important to maintain Esrp2 protein expression and function . Our results are not limited to the mouse model , but led to the discovery of a novel human homolog of Esrp2 - as with elevated levels in human breast cancer , associated with elevated risk of cancer recurrence . RESULTS Genome - wide screen to identify differentially methylated lncRNAs For the detection of lncRNAs with aberrant methylation during carcinogenesis , we made use of the transgenic C3 ( 1 ) SV40TAg ( C3 ( 1 ) ) transgenic mouse model of human breast cancer . 20 , 21 We performed a genome - wide screen by ‘ Methylated CpG Immuno - precipitation ’ to enrich for highly methylated DNA fragments , 22 followed by next generation sequencing ( MCIp - seq ) . Comparison of tumor samples with mammary glands of age - matched wildtype ( WT ) control animals identi ﬁ ed 6570 differentially methylated regions ( DMRs ) ( Figure 1 ) . By overlapping DMRs with promoters of mouse Refseq annotated lncRNAs , we identi ﬁ ed 37 hyper - and 32 hypomethylated lncRNA promoters ( Table 1 ) . RNA - seq analyses of M6 and M27 H4 tumor cell lines derived from the C3 ( 1 ) mouse model 23 and 3T3 - L1 murine adipocytes indicated that about half of the identi ﬁ ed lncRNAs were expressed ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . We further focused on lncRNA candidates with neighboring mRNAs in antisense orientation and thus identi ﬁ ed 26 pairs of protein - coding and noncoding RNAs with signi ﬁ cant correlation of expression levels ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Except for two lncRNA / mRNA pairs ( Foxd2os / Foxd2 , F730043M19Rik / Atxn7l1 ) , coding genes were up to 2800 - fold higher expressed than their antisense lncRNAs ( Supplementary Fig S1B ) . Using published microarray data for the C3 ( 1 ) mouse model , 24 we found Pcdh7 , Gabrg3 , and Hoxa11 signi ﬁ cantly downregulated , and Otud7a , Lsr , and Esrp2 ( Supplementary Figure S1C ) upregulated in tumors vs normal mammary glands . We selected the Esrp2 / Esrp2 - as pair for further analysis of epigenetic gene regulation , owing to the functional role of ESRP2 in regulation of epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition . Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as are coordinately overexpressed in C3 ( 1 ) mammary gland tumors Esrp2 - as is expressed as four annotated transcripts with a length between 1 . 2 and 1 . 6 kb ( Figure 2a ) . Three long transcript variants ( v1 - 3 ) share a common TSS approximately 1 . 6 kb downstream of the Esrp2 TSS . In contrast , the TSS for the short variant ( v4 ) is about 100 bp upstream of the Esrp2 TSS . RT – qPCR analyses with primers detecting variants v1 - 4 or v1 + 2 revealed that all variants together were about 20 - fold higher expressed than the long variants v1 + 2 , suggesting that the short variant v4 represents the major transcript . Publicly accessible FANTOM5 CAGE - seq data 32 , 33 ( Cap Analysis of Gene Expression ) con ﬁ rmed transcription initiation for both the short and the long variants of Esrp2 - as ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) , underlining expression of all transcript variants in mouse mammary glands . In tumor tissue , Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as v1 - 4 levels were signi ﬁ cantly 3 - and 2 - fold elevated , whereas the long variants v1 + 2 were not differentially expressed ( Figure 2b ) . Expression of Esrp2 and the antisense transcripts v1 - 4 were highly correlated in tumors and normal tissues from the mouse model and in various mouse cell lines ( Figure 2c ) . Similarly , expression of Esrp2 - as v1 + 2 and v1 - 4 were highly correlated ( Supplementary Figure S3 and S4 ) . These results pointed either to a mutual regulation of expression between the coding and noncoding transcripts , or to a common control mechanism . Esrp2 CpG island shores are differentially methylated in C3 ( 1 ) tumors and cell lines The CGI located in the Esrp2 promoter region was generally unmethylated in normal mouse tissues , whereas CGI shores ( regions of 2 kb on either side of a CGI ) displayed variable methylation between tissues that express Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as ( liver , kidney , stomach , lung ) and those that do not ( spleen and heart ; Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Thus , we designed EPITYPER amplicons covering the DMR ( Figure 3a , Amplicon A1 ) , the CGI ( A6 - A8 ) , as well as the CGI shore regions ( A2 - A5 , A9 - A14 ) for quantitative methylation analyses . The central region spanning the CGI ( A6 - A8 ) was unmethylated in both tumor and normal tissue , whereas the DMR ( A1 ) and individual CpG units in the shore regions covered by amplicons A3 - A5 and A9 - A11 were hypomethylated in tumor tissue ( Figure 3b ) . Analysis of spleen and liver samples of the C3 ( 1 ) model con ﬁ rmed good concordance of EPITYPER data with published whole genome bisul ﬁ te sequencing ( WGBS ) data ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes and MC38 colon carcinoma cells were 70 – 90 % methylated in the analyzed region , DMRs in promoter of Refseq lncRNAs 69 candidates Protein coding RNA antisense to lncRNA 26 candidate pairs Protein coding RNA covered on gene expression micorarray 23 candidate pairs Genome - wide screen for DMRs in C3 ( 1 ) mouse model of breast cancer 1614 hyper - , 4956 hypomethylated DMRs Significant expression difference tumor vs . normal mammary gland 6 candidate pairs Literature search for gene functions Figure 1 .

Consistent with a gene silencing function of promoter methylation , 3T3 - L1 and MC38 cell lines had lowest expression levels of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as ( Supplementary Figure S4A ) . We observed strong negative correlation between sense / antisense transcript expression and methylation levels in tumor samples and normal tissue ( Figure 3d ) as well as in cell lines ( Figure 3e ) . These results con ﬁ rmed that the region around the Esrp2 TSS is differentially methylated , and methylation inversely correlated with expression of both the protein - coding and the noncoding RNA . Demethylation induces reexpression of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as To functionally test the correlation of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as methylation and gene expression , we performed demethylation experiments in M27 H4 cells by treatment with 1 μ M Decitabine ( DAC ) . DNA methylation levels decreased by 10 - 30 % in amplicons that were 4 20 % methylated in the DMSO solvent control ( Figure 4a ) . Both Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as v1 - 4 transcript levels increased by 3 - and 4 - fold , whereas the increase in Esrp2 - as v1 + 2 levels was only marginal ( Figure 4b ) . These results suggested concomitant regulation of Esrp2 and the short Esrp2 - as variant v4 expression by methylation . The long Esrp2 transcript variants might be regulated independently . Luciferase reporter assays con ﬁ rm a bidirectional promoter and an enhancer region To explore in more detail the genomic regions involved in regulation of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as expression we performed dual luciferase reporter assays using promoter constructs ( P ) of Esrp2 and the long variants of Esrp2 - as v1 - 3 ( Figure 4c ) .

Epigenetic control of coordinate Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as expression K Heilmann et al 6451 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 6446 – 6461 gene ( sense to the Esrp2 - as v4 transcript ) revealed almost equally high luciferase activity as for the Esrp2 P1 fragment ( Figure 4e ) , indicating that the Esrp2 P1 region has bidirectional promoter activity for expression of both Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as . ChIP - seq data available for murine liver and kidney 34 demon - strated occupancy by enhancer marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in the region next to the TSS of the long Esrp2 - as variants v1 - 3 , suggesting that this region might have enhancer functions . We thus analyzed Esrp2 - as E1 – E4 regions in luciferase vectors to test for enhancer activity . The E4 region led to strongest activation of the reporter construct with a minimal promoter ( Figure 4f ) , but not with the Esrp2 P1 promoter ( Supplementary Fig S7 ) . These data explain coordinate expression of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as from a bidirectional promoter in cooperation with an enhancer region . Knockdown of Esrp2 - as reduces Esrp2 protein expression without affecting the mRNA level LncRNAs have been reported to target gene activating or repressive functions to speci ﬁ c DNA loci . 2 , 5 , 8 This prompted us to analyze whether Esrp2 - as might epigenetically control expres - sion of Esrp2 by a similar mechanism . Knockdown of Esrp2 - as with two locked nucleic acid antisense Gapmers ( LNAs ) targeting the last exon of the Esrp2 - as variants ef ﬁ ciently reduced antisense transcript levels by 60 – 80 % , but did not in ﬂ uence Esrp2 mRNA levels ( Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure S8 ) . Equally , transient overexpression of Esrp2 - as v4 in M27 H4 cells did not affect Esrp2 transcript levels ( Figure 5b ) . Additional knockdown or over - expression attempts in various other cell lines produced similar results ( Supplementary Figure S8 ) . To exclude the possibility that expression of the coding transcript regulates noncoding RNA levels , we also generated a M27 H4 cell population that stably overexpressed Esrp2 . Under these conditions , Esrp2 - as levels were not affected . This was also true for an Esrp2 - overexpressing 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte population ( Supplementary Figure S9 ) . From these data we concluded that Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as do not transcription - ally regulate expression of the transcript on the other strand . Besides in ﬂ uencing transcriptional regulation , lncRNAs have been reported to affect protein translation or stability . 2 , 3 , 5 By western blotting experiments , we could demonstrate that knock - down of Esrp2 - as led to a signi ﬁ cant 40 % reduction of Esrp2 protein levels in the M6 cell line ( Figure 5c ) . Overexpression of the short variant v4 was however not suf ﬁ cient to induce detectable Esrp2 protein levels in M27 H4 and 3T3 - L1 cells , in which the gene is silenced by promoter methylation ( Supplementary Figure S10 ) . Knockdown of Esrp2 - as induces extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and EMT regulators and reduces cell proliferation To further investigate the function of Esrp2 - as , we assessed genome - wide changes in gene expression by RNA - seq after knockdown and overexpression . Overexpression of the short Esrp2 - as v4 had only minor in ﬂ uence on gene expression in M27 H4 and 3T3 - L1 cells , with signi ﬁ cant transcriptional changes ( FDR - adjusted P - value o 0 . 05 ) of only 1 and 5 genes , respectively ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . This argues against regulatory potential in trans . Reducing the level of the noncoding RNA by about 80 % in the M6 cell line by LNA # 2 led to signi ﬁ cant alterations in expression of 185 genes , with the majority of genes ( 76 % ) being upregulated ( Figure 5d , Supplementary Table S2 ) . For further analyses we focused on the knockdown effects . Differentially expressed genes were signi ﬁ cantly enriched in extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins , including collagens and glycoproteins , ECM regulators , and secreted factors ( collectively de ﬁ ned as the matrisome 36 ) . Further enriched gene ontologies include tissue development , locomotion and motility , regulation of cell death and cell proliferation , and cellular response to stimuli and stress ( Figure 5e and Supplementary Table S3 ) . A strong in ﬂ uence of Esrp2 - as knockdown on ECM and cell motility was con ﬁ rmed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ; www . qiagen . com / ingenuity ) ( Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Figure S11 ) . The top # 1 network represents many ECM proteins as well as the ECM receptor integrin B2 and Zeb1 , a transcriptional repressor and inducer of EMT . Top # 2 and # 3 networks were associated with ‘ Cell Morphology , Connective Tissue Development and Function ’ and ‘ Cell Cycle and Cancer ’ with p53 central to the network ( Supplementary Figure S11 ) . We veri ﬁ ed signi ﬁ cant upregulation of several ECM and EMT - associated factors including Zeb1 and consequent downregulation of E - cadherin by RT – qPCR analyses . The pattern of expression changes induced by Esrp2 - as knockdown recapitulated the expression differences observed in primary murine mammary epithelial cells ( Mecs ) versus mammary ﬁ broblasts . mRNA levels of Esrp2 , Esrp2 - as and the epithelial marker Cdh1 were high in Mecs , but barely detectable in ﬁ broblasts , which instead highly expressed MMP9 , Plau , Prl2c3 and Zeb1 ( Supplementary Figure S12A ) . RNA - seq data revealed reduced expression of luminal cell differentiation markers after Esrp2 - as knockdown in M6 cells , whereas expression of additional EMT transcription factors 37 and cancer stem cell makers 38 was increased ( Supplementary Figure S12B ) . All of these results point to the activation of EMT after Esrp2 - as knockdown and are consistent with the loss of Esrp2 protein expression . As a functional consequence of the altered gene expression pro ﬁ les , knockdown of Esrp2 - as led to 40 % reduced cell proliferation detectable from day 3 post transfection ( Figure 5f ) . Figure 5 . Knockdown of Esrp2 - as reduces Esrp2 protein levels , globally alters expression of genes involved in cellular motility and inhibits cell proliferation .

Epigenetic control of coordinate Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as expression K Heilmann et al 6452 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 6446 – 6461 Concomitantly , we observed downregulation of cell proliferation markers Ki67 and Pcna , and signi ﬁ cant upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and several targets of p53 that are associated with tumor - suppressive or cell growth - inhibitory function ( S11 Network # 3 and Supplementary Figure S12B ) . Conversely , over - expression of the short Esrp2 - as v4 resulted in slight ( albeit not signi ﬁ cant ) induction of cell growth in both M27 H4 and 3T3 - L1 cell lines ( Figure 5f ) . Collectively , these data indicate that knockdown of Esrp2 - as and the concomitant loss in Esrp2 protein expression lead to alterations in gene expression suggestive of a more mesenchy - mal / ﬁ broblast - like phenotype with enhanced cell migratory Knockdown Esrp2 - as ( M6 ) Overexpression Esrp2 - as ( M27 H4 ) no i sse r p xe ANR l r t c . g e n o t . l e r Esrp2 - as ( v1 - 4 ) Esrp2 neg . ctrl LNA # 2 LNA # 2 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 * ns neg . ctrl no i sse r p xe ANR VE o t . l e r EV v4 EV v4 0 . 1 1 10 100 1000 ns . l e r no i t a r e f il o r P ) 5 ya d ( l r t c . g e n o t 0 50 100 150 * * Time ( days ) . l e r no i t a r e f il o r P ) 5 ya d ( l r t c . g e n o t 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 50 100 150 neg . ctrl LNA # 2 * * . l e r no i t a r e f il o r P ) 5 ya d ( VE o t EV v4 EV v4 0 50 100 150 200 ns ns neg . ctrl LNA # 2 M6 M6 M27 H4 . r p xe n i e t o r p 2 p r s E l r t c . g e n o t . l e r 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 * neg . ctrl LNA # 2 M6 - log ( adj . p - value ) 0 5 10 15 GO _ Negative regulation of response to stimulus GO _ Positive regulation of multicellular organismal process GO _ Cell motility GO _ Localization of cell GO _ Regulation of cell proliferation GO _ Regulation of response to stress ONDER _ CDH1 targets 2 dn GO _ Movement of cellular or subcellular component GO _ Regulation of cell death GO _ Extracellular space GO _ Cellular response to organic substance GO _ Positive regulation of response to stimulus GO _ Locomotion GO _ Tissue development NABA _ Matrisome 3T3 - L1 Epigenetic control of coordinate Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as expression K Heilmann et al 6453 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 6446 – 6461 potential and reduced cell proliferation capacity , whereas Esrp2 - as overexpression promotes proliferation . ESRP2 and ESRP2 - AS are hypomethylated and overexpressed in human breast cancer , and indicate poor prognosis A human homolog of Esrp2 - as has not been annotated yet , but various lines of evidence indicate its existence . ( i ) CAGE - seq data for MCF7 human breast cancer cells ( FANTOM5 , 32 ) suggested transcription initiation at locations corresponding to the TSSs of mouse Esrp2 - as ( Figure 6a ) . ( ii ) Strand - speci ﬁ c RNA - seq datasets of polyA - enriched MCF7 RNA ( provided by ENCODE 39 in the UCSC genome browser 40 ) indicated transcription of a human ESRP2 - AS homolog ( Figure 6a ) . ( iii ) Alignment analyses of the mouse Esrp2 - as v1 and the putative human ESRP2 - AS ( red bar in Figure 6a ) revealed 67 . 75 % identity of both transcripts , especially at the 5 ′ - end that showed a higher degree of conservation than the 3 ′ - end ( Supplementary Figure S13 ) . ( iv ) We were able to detect ESRP2 - AS expression in four human tumor cells lines by RT – qPCR ( Figure 6b ) . We observed highest expression in estrogen receptor - positive MCF7 breast cancer cells and in HepG2 human hepatoma cells , and lower expression levels in the basal - like breast cancer cell lines MDA - MB231 and MCF10a . The pattern of expression using four different primer pairs was similar in all cell lines , supporting the notion that the human ESRP2 antisense transcript is expressed . ( v ) DAC treatment of MCF7 and MDA - MB231 cells led to a 1 . 8 - to 4 . 4 - fold increase in expression levels of both ESRP2 and ESRP2 - AS transcripts , corroborating epigenetic regulation in human breast cancer cell lines ( Figure 6b ) . To compare expression of ESRP2 and ESPR2 - AS in human breast tumors , we obtained RNA - seq read counts for 1002 tumor samples and 45 normal controls from ‘ The Cancer Genome Atlas ’ consortium ( TCGA , http : / / cancergenome . nih . gov ) . ESRP2 was signi ﬁ cantly overexpressed in tumor samples compared to normal breast tissue ( Figure 6c ) . Since bioinformatic tools did not recognize ESPR2 - AS as a novel transcript , we computed normal - ized read counts for the 4 . 6 kb region spanning the putative transcript in MCF7 cells ( Figure 6a ) . Expression of ESPR2 - AS was about 40 - fold lower than that of the ESRP2 mRNA , but signi ﬁ cantly elevated in tumor tissue vs normal breast tissue . Consistently , ESRP2 and ESRP2 - AS expression levels highly correlated ( Figure 6c ) . WGBS data provided by TCGA demonstrated that the CGI covering the upstream promoter region of ESRP2 was lowly methylated , whereas the region overlapping with the mouse EPITYPER amplicons A4 - A6 was hypomethylated in tumor samples compared to adjacent normal tissue ( Figure 6a ) . The methylation patterns were very similar to those observed in the C3 ( 1 ) mouse model ( Figure 3b ) . We extracted 450 k DNA methylation data for 636 breast tumors and 35 normal controls from TCGA . Breast tumors were signi ﬁ cantly hypomethylated compared to normal breast tissue in the region covered by CpG sites 3 - 7 , downstream of the ESRP2 TSS ( Supplementary Figure S14A ) . Methylation and expression levels of both transcripts inversely correlated , with highest anti - correlation in normal breast tissue , especially at CpG sites 3 - 6 , 13 and 15 . Inverse correlation in tumor tissue was weaker than in normal tissue and spread over the CGI from CpG sites 3 - 16 ( Supplementary Figure S14B ) . High expression of both ESRP2 and ESRP2 - AS was signi ﬁ cantly associated with lower disease - free survival in the TCGA breast cancer cohort , based on the analysis of 814 informative cancer cases with a total of 107 events and a follow - up time up to 281 months ( Figure 6d ) . Using the Kaplan – Meier plotter survival analysis tool , 41 we could con ﬁ rm that high ESRP2 mRNA levels reduce the fraction of relapse - free survival , overall survival , and distant metastasis - free survival of breast cancer cases analyzed together or when cases were subdivided into breast cancer subtypes ( Supplementary Figure S15 ) . DISCUSSION The present study aimed to identify lncRNAs epigenetically regulated during breast carcinogenesis in the C3 ( 1 ) mouse model . 20 , 24 A recent study by Li et al . followed a similar approach in human breast cancer . 42 The authors identi ﬁ ed several hundred differentially expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs with aberrantly methylated promoters . These ncRNAs had high diagnostic potential and were involved in several pathways dysregulated in human breast cancer . EVX1 - AS , MAGI2 - AS , FOXD2 - AS , FENDRR and HOXA11 - AS were among the 69 differentially methylated lncRNAs identi ﬁ ed in our study , emphasizing the relevance of the mouse model for human breast cancer . 43 , 44 Histological , transcriptomic and miRNA expression analyses have shown that this model best re ﬂ ects the aggressive Luminal B and basal - like subtypes , 24 , 45 , 46 which are associated with high mortality and poor prognosis . 47 , 48 Few of the differentially methylated lncRNAs have been functionally analyzed , with the exception of Haglr , Fendrr , and Hoxa11as that regulate expression of protein - coding genes . 49 – 52 Interestingly , RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing identi ﬁ ed that in embryonic stem cells , 17 of the 69 lncRNAs ( indicated in Table 1 ) were associated with EZH2 , an important member of the PRC2 Polycomb repressive complex . 31 This observation suggests that these lncRNAs might be actively involved in the recruitment of the PRC2 complex . Genes near hypermethylated lncRNAs were enriched in members of the homeobox family of developmental regulators . 53 Hypermethyla - tion of homeobox genes has been identi ﬁ ed as an early epigenetic event in human breast cancer , 54 , 55 acting in parallel with Polycomb repression to reduce the regulatory plasticity of these key regulatory genes . 56 Accordingly , gene set enrichment analyses ( GSEA ) 35 , 57 revealed that eight of the 17 genes located close to hypermethylated lncRNAs were targets of the PRC2 or marked by the repressive histone modi ﬁ cation H3K27me3 in differentiated or progenitor cells . 58 – 60 Our study now adds epigenetic regulation of lncRNAs located close to these genes as an additional layer of regulation . Nine of the hypomethylated lncRNAs were associated with protein - coding genes in their vicinity . These genes were ampli ﬁ ed ( Hoxa11 , Hoxa2 ) or silenced by methylation ( Irs2 , Thbs1 ) in human breast cancer , 61 , 62 or downregulated in metastases from malig - nant melanoma compared to primary tumors ( Esrp2 , Palmd , Lsr ) . 63 LSR levels were shown to correlate with ER α expression in human breast cancer , with lower expression in patient samples with lymph node invasion and distant metastases . 30 We were interested in investigating whether epigenetic regulation of lncRNAs might in ﬂ uence expression of protein - coding genes in their vicinity , using the Esrp2 / Esrp2 - as pair as an example . We veri ﬁ ed hypomethylation and coordinate upregulation of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as in tumors of the C3 ( 1 ) model compared to normal mammary glands . Demethylation experiments as well as luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that co - expression of Esrp2 and the short Esrp2 - as variant v4 is regulated by methylation of a putative enhancer region proximal to a bidirectional promoter , which was generally lowly methylated . Reporter assays also con ﬁ rmed that fragment E4 ( corresponding to amplicon A1 ) had enhancer activity ( Figure 4 ) . These results are consistent with the observation that enhancer methylation often correlates even better with gene expression than promoter methylation . 64 , 65 To analyze whether the long Esrp2 - as variants v1 - 3 are expressed from an independent promoter , we performed reporter assays using constructs covering the putative promoter region of the long variants . The results were inconclusive ( Figure 4 ) . This might be due to a lack of essential transcription factors in the Hepa1 . 6 cell line used for transfection , indicated by 400 - fold lower expression levels of Esrp2 - as v1 + 2 relative to v1 - 4 compared to Epigenetic control of coordinate Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as expression K Heilmann et al 6454 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 6446 – 6461 20 - fold lower levels in most other cell lines ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . Expression of Esrp2 - as v1 + 2 highly correlated with v1 - 4 and Esrp2 in various tissues and cell lines ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . However , the fact that different from v1 - 4 , the long variants v1 + 2 were not overexpressed in C3 ( 1 ) mouse tumors ( Figure 2b ) and also did not get re - expressed after DAC treatment ( Figure 4b ) suggests that additional factors contribute to regulation of expression of these long variants .

Epigenetic control of coordinate Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as expression K Heilmann et al 6455 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 6446 – 6461 Comparison of WGBS and RNA - seq data for various murine tissues suggested that differential methylation in the putative promoter region of the long variants ( covered by amplicons A3 - A5 ) might contribute to cell type - and tissue - speci ﬁ c expression of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Differential methylation was veri ﬁ ed in spleen versus liver ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . We also con ﬁ rmed low expression of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as in murine mammary ﬁ broblast versus Mecs . The long variants v1 + 2 were undetectable in ﬁ broblasts , whereas expression levels of Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as v1 - 4 were 13 - and 10 . 5 - fold higher in primary murine Mecs than in ﬁ broblasts ( Supplementary Figure S12 ) . The preferential epithelial expression of Esrps was noted previously 66 and led to their designation as epithelial splicing regulatory proteins . 66 Earlier work also indicated that induction of EMT by TGFB1 , ( ref . 13 ) overexpression of EMT - inducing TFs or knockdown of E - cadherin completely abrogated Esrp expression . 66 Knockdown or overexpression experiments did not support a role of Esrp2 - as in transcriptional regulation of Esrp2 ( Figure 5 , Supplementary Figure S8 ) . Rather , knockdown of Esrp2 - as led to a signi ﬁ cant reduction in Esrp2 protein levels . LncRNAs can alter translation of protein - coding genes without affecting mRNA levels , for example , by formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex with RNA - binding proteins , as shown for the regulation of E - cadherin by translational regulatory lncRNA ( treRNA ) with tumor - and metastasis - promoting properties . 67 LncRNAs can also in ﬂ uence the association of mRNAs with active polysomes , such as lincRNA - p21 regulating β - catenin and JUNB levels , 68 GAS5 interacting with MYC mRNA to reduce its translation , 69 or lncRNA - Uchl1 controlling Ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase - L1 ( Uchl1 ) translation in mice . 70 Alternatively , direct lncRNA - protein interaction can in ﬂ uence protein stability , as reported for the interaction of BMI1 , a member of the PRC1 repressive complex , with oncogenic FAL1 ( ref . 6 ) and for lncRNA PVT1 interacting with MYC , thus preventing MYC phosphorylation and degradation . 71 , 72 Further analyses have to clarify how Esrp2 - as contributes to enhancing Esrp2 translation or protein stability . Knockdown of Esrp2 - as in M6 cells resulted in signi ﬁ cant differential expression of 185 genes , many of which code for ECM core proteins ( collagens , Multimerin - 2 , Netrin - G2 ) , ECM remodelers 15 ( MMP9 , Plau , Serpins ) , or secreted factors regulating the ECM 36 , 73 ( Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Table S3 , Supplementary Figure S12 ) . Alterations in the ECM facilitate cell migration , and consistently , we observed upregulation of several transcription factors controlling EMT , 16 such as Zeb1 , Zeb2 , Snail2 , and Twist2 , resulting in reduced expression of E - cadherin . Knockdown of Esrp2 - as also induced a more cancer stem cell - like transcriptional pro ﬁ le , with reduced expression of differentiation markers ( Epcam , Gata3 ( ref . 74 ) ) and upregulation of stem cell markers , such as Sca - 1 ( ref . 75 ) , Lgr6 ( ref . 76 ) and Procr . 77 It is currently thought that ESRPs are repressed by EMT regulators such as Zeb1 ( ref . 13 ) , and subsequent alternative splicing events contribute to EMT . 17 Here we show that downregulation of Esrp2 - as and loss of Esrp2 protein increased expression of the EMT regulators . These ﬁ ndings suggest more complex regulatory circuits and feedback loops between up - and downstream factors involved in regulation of EMT than currently anticipated . Lineage tracing 78 , 79 and conditional knockin and knockout mouse models might be a tool to delineate causes and consequences of Esrp2 - as expression during carcinogenesis . 80 , 81 Knockdown of Esrp2 - as in the M6 cell line resulted in reduced cell proliferation and reduced expression of proliferation markers Pcna and Ki67 concomitant with upregulation of genes with anti - proliferative or tumor - suppressive properties , including the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p21 , TP53Inp1 ( ref . 82 ) , Ass1 ( ref . 83 ) , Inka2 ( ref . 84 ) , and Edar2r . 85 Conversely , overexpression of Esrp2 - as in M27 H4 and 3T3 - L1 cells weakly induced cell proliferation ( Figure 5f ) . Since Esrp2 - as acts at the translational level or directly targets Esrp2 protein , and these cell lines do not express detectable levels of Esrp2 protein , the effects of Esrp2 - as overexpression might be underestimated . Collectively , our data support the described context - dependent dual function of ESRP2 in cancer progression . 19 Elevated levels maintain an epithelial phenotype and proliferative capacity , whereas low levels , as observed at the invasive front in oral squamous cell carcinoma 86 and at the resection border in colon cancer 87 facilitated EMT , migration , and invasion into the ECM . Both up - and downregulation of ESRP2 could therefore contribute to tumor progression . In addition , ESRP2 expression might be subject to intra - tumor heterogeneity , with higher levels in the center and reduced expression at the periphery in response to signals from the ECM , 13 consistent with the plastic expression in oral cancers . 86 In clear cell renal carcinoma , ESRP2 splicing function , but not mRNA levels , was an important indicator of prognosis , and splicing was facilitated by ubiquitination of ESRP2 by the ubiquitin ligase Arkadia . 88 In this context , it will be interesting to investigate whether the regulatory role of Esrp2 - as on Esrp2 protein might involve an in ﬂ uence on post - translational modi ﬁ cations , as described for the interaction of PVT1 and MYC . 71 LncRNAs generally show less interspecies conservation than protein - coding genes . 89 , 90 Nonetheless , using an in silico approach we identi ﬁ ed a novel , unannotated human homolog of Esrp2 - as that shares 67 . 5 % identity with the long Esrp2 - as v1 ( Supplementary Figure S13B ) . We con ﬁ rmed expression and epigenetic regulation by RT – qPCR analyses and DAC treatment of human cancer cell lines . Using public data from TCGA we detected that ESRP2 and ESRP2 - AS expression is upregulated in human breast tumors and that DNA methylation inversely correlated with expression . Upregulation of both transcripts is associated with a signi ﬁ cantly elevated hazard ratio for tumor relapse . These ﬁ ndings support the value of mouse models for investigations of human diseases and in providing clinically relevant results . 43 , 45 , 91 Taken together , we here present a resource of lncRNAs that are epigenetically regulated during mammary carcinogenesis in the C3 ( 1 ) mouse model of breast cancer . Several of the transcripts have been identi ﬁ ed as differentially methylated in human breast cancer . We provide novel evidence for the coordinated epigenetic regulation of the splicing regulator Esrp2 and its antisense transcript Esrp2 - as by differential methylation of a proximal enhancer region . Esrp2 - as affects Esrp2 translation or protein stability , and loss of function experiments indicate a role in the transcriptional regulation of EMT and cell proliferation . These ﬁ ndings are highly relevant for human breast cancer , as our analyses led to the identi ﬁ cation of a novel human homolog of Esrp2 - as , which is upregulated in human breast cancer and indicates poor prognosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Mouse handling and sample collection The FVB / N C3 ( 1 ) SV40TAg mouse model of human breast cancer was previously described . 20 , 21 , 23 Mice were housed and bred in the animal facility of the German Cancer Research Center . Genotyping of mice was conducted by PCR with the following primer pairs ( C3 ( 1 ) : fwd : 5 ′ - GGACAAACCACAACTAGAATGCAG - 3 ′ , rev : 5 ′ - CAGAGCAGAATTGTGGA GTGG ; WT : fwd 5 ′ - GTCAGTCGAGTGCACAGTTT - 3 ′ rev : 5 ′ - CAAATGTTGCTT GTCTGGTG - 3 ′ ) . Animals were sacri ﬁ ced by CO 2 at 20 and 24 weeks of age , and tumors and mammary glands of age - matched WT mice were resected and immediately ﬂ ash frozen in liquid nitrogen . The study was approved by the state Animal Care and Use Committee ( Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe ) as regulated by German federal law for animal welfare under the registration number 35 - 9185 . 82 / A - 15 / 08 . Epigenetic control of coordinate Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as expression K Heilmann et al 6456 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 6446 – 6461 Nucleic acid isolation DNA and RNA from tissue samples and cell lines were isolated using the DNA & RNA allPrep Kit or the RNeasy Mini Kit ( both Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) following the manufacturer ’ s instructions , including an on - column DNAse I digest for RNA isolation ( RNase - free DNAse set , Qiagen ) . DNA and RNA were quality checked by Agilent Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) and quanti ﬁ ed by Nano Drop spectrophotometry and Qubit ﬂ uorimetry ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , Wilmington , USA ) . MCIp - seq MCIp - seq 92 , 93 was used for genome - wide DNA methylation analysis as in Sonnet et al . 92 with minor modi ﬁ cations . In brief , 5 μ g DNA in 120 μ l EB buffer was sheared to ≈ 150 bp using a S2 sonicator ( Covaris , Woburn , MA , USA ) for 6 cycles ( duty cycle 20 % , intensity 5 , burst per cycle 200 , time : 60 s ) . Size distribution was con ﬁ rmed on a DNA High sensitivity Chip ( Agilent Bioanalyzer ) , before proceeding with MCIp reaction using a SX8G - V52 robot ( Diagenode , Liège , Belgium ) for automated processing . 60 μ g of MBD2 - Fc protein and 40 μ l of protein A coated paramagnetic beads ( Diagenode ) were used for the reaction . DNA eluted with the highest salt concentration was submitted to the DKFZ Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility for library preparation and next generation sequencing on an Ilumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer ( single read 50 bp ) . We processed DNA from 3 tumors and 3 WT mammary glands each for the 20 and 24 week age groups for MCIp analysis . Alignment of reads to the mouse reference genome mm10 was performed with Burrows Wheeler aligner ( BWA ) 94 and duplicate as well as bad quality reads were removed with Picard ( https : / / broadinstitue . github . io / picard ) and Samtools . 95 Saturation ef ﬁ ciency and CG - coverage by the R - MEDIPs package 96 provided an additional control step . Data can be accessed under Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) accession number GSE77096 . DMR calling and candidate selection For calling of DMRs , reads for animals of the same age group and genotype were combined and analyzed with Homer ( ﬁ ndPeaks : FDR o 0 . 001 , P - value o 0 . 0001 , size 150 bp , minDist 300 bp ) . 97 Co - ocurrence of DMRs was calculated by the mergePeaks command ( - d 300 – venn ) and DMRs were overlapped with promoter regions of 3639 Refseq lncRNA ( + 2 kb , - 0 . 5 kb TSS ) ( GRCm38 / mm10 , http : / / genome . ucsc . edu , 98 ) by Bedtools intersectBed . 99 We selected lncRNAs with a neighboring protein - coding RNA in antisense orientation , and the TSSs should be maximally 2 kb apart . We requested that gene expression in the C3 ( 1 ) mouse model 24 was signi ﬁ cantly different ( P o 0 . 05 , two - sided , unpaired Student ’ s t - test ) between tumor samples and mammary glands for the protein - coding RNAs . cDNA synthesis and RT – qPCR Five hundred nanogram to 1 μ g of RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Life Technologies , Darmstadt , Ger - many ) using 200 ng random hexamers . Real - time qPCR analysis was performed using the Universal Probe Library system ( Roche , Penzberg , Germany ) using a program of 15 min at 95 °C followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C , 20 s at 55 °C and 10 s at 72 °C on a Lightcycler480 Real - Time PCR System ( Roche ) .

For dual luciferase reporter assays , sequences covering regions upstream of the Esrp2 and the Esrp2 - as TSS were PCR ampli ﬁ ed from genomic DNA attaching HindIII and / or NheI restriction sites . Fragments were inserted into the respectively cut pGL4 . 10 and pGL4 . 23 vectors ( Promega Madison , WI , USA ) for assessment of promoter or enhancer activity . Correct sequences of clones were ascertained by Sanger sequencing ( GATC biotech , Konstanz , Germany ) . Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S7 . Dual luciferase reporter assays Hepa1 . 6 cells were reverse transfected with 40 ng of pGL4 . 10 or pGL4 . 23 ﬁ re ﬂ y luciferase reporter constructs using 0 . 2 μ l GenJet ( Ver . II - LnCAP ) ( SignaGen Laboratories , Rockville , MD , USA ) and 10 ng CMV - Renilla luciferase as a transfection normalization control . The plasmids were separately adjusted to 5 μ l with plain DMEM and incubated for 5 min before mixing . The transfection reagent was diluted in 5 μ l DMEM and after short mixing immediately added to the plasmids . After incubation for 15 min , the transfection mixture was added to the wells of a 384 well plate with ≈ 6000 cells per well . Luciferase activity was measured after 48 h on a Spectramax microplate reader as previously described . 108 Measurements were taken for 8 technical transfection replicates of 4 independent experiments and normalized to the respective pGL4 . 10 or pGL4 . 23 EV . LNA antisense Gapmer - mediated knockdown Custom designed antisense oligos ( Exiqon , Vedbaek , Denmark ) against Esrp2 - as and the negative control oligo A were reverse transfected into cell lines M6 , M28 N2 and NMuMG with Dharmafect 1 solution ( GE Healthcare , Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom ) . For transfections , LNAs at 20 n M and Dharmafect1 ( 2 μ l per well for 12 - plates ) were mixed in serum - free DMEM according to manufacturer ’ s instructions . The transfection mix was added to the cells and incubated for 72 h ( M6 , NMuMG ) or 96 h ( M6 , M28 N2 ) . In M6 cells , a long - term knockdown series was performed by repeatedly transfecting cells for four times in 96 h intervals . Esrp2 - as and Esrp2 expression was analyzed by RT – qPCR and RNA - seq . Overexpression of Esrp2 - as and Esrp2 For overexpression of Esrp2 - as in M27 H4 , Hepa 1 . 6 , and 3T3 - L1 cells , constructs ( v1 or v4 ) were diluted in serum - free DMEM and mixed with Epigenetic control of coordinate Esrp2 and Esrp2 - as expression K Heilmann et al 6457 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 6446 – 6461 respectively diluted TransIT - Lt1 transfection reagent ( Mirus Bio LLC , Madison , WI , USA ) at a ratio of 3 : 1 Transfection reagent to plasmid DNA . 20 – 30 min after mixing , the transfection mix was evenly distributed to cells , which were seeded 18 – 24 h before ( ≈ 1×10 5 cells per well in six - well plates ) . Cells were harvested after 72 h ( M27 H4 , 3T3 - L1 ) or 48 h ( Hepa 1 . 6 and 3T3 - L1 ) and analyzed by RT – qPCR or RNA - seq . The retroviral vector pMXs - IRES - Blast - Esrp2 - FF 109 and the corresponding empty vector with GFP were a gift from Russ P Carstens ( University of Pennsylvania ) . Retroviral infection of M27 H4 and 3T3 - L1 cells was performed as in , 110 followed by selection with Blasticidin S ( Sigma - Aldrich , Taufkirchen , Germany ) at 5 μ g / ml for stable incorporation . Protein extraction and western blot analysis Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing washed cells in RIPA buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl pH7 . 5 , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 25 % sodium deoxycholate , 150 m M sodium chloride , 2 m M magnesium chloride , 0 . 1 % sodiumdodecylsulfate ) on ice for 10 min with 2 – 3 steps of thorough vortexing . Protein content was determined using the Bicinchoninic acid assay ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Dreieich , Germany ) . Equal amounts of proteins were supple - mented with 4x TruPage Lithium dodecyl sulfate ( LDS ) loading buffer ( Sigma , Germany ) and denatured by boiling at 95 °C for 20 min . Lysates were loaded onto precasted 4 - 20 % Bis - Tris polyacrylamide TruPage gels ( Sigma , Germany ) . Electrophoresis , blotting , detection and quanti ﬁ cation were performed as described in Pappa et al . 111 For detection of Esrp2 , anti - Esrp2 monoclonal antibody ( 210 - 301 - C32S , Rockland Immunochem - icals , USA ) was used at 1 : 250 dilution . Equal loading was ensured by detecting β - actin ( sc - 47778 , 1 : 10 000 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . , Heidelberg , Germany ) . RNA Ribodepletion and RNA - seq Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) from two to three independent replicates each of M6 cells after knockdown of Esrp2 - as using LNA # 2 or transfected with negative control LNA for 72 h , and M27 H4 / 3T3 - L1 cells after overexpression of Esrp2 - as v4 or transfected with EV for 72 h . Ribosomal RNA was removed from the RNA samples using the Ribo - Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit ( MRZG12324 , Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) following the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Ribodepleted RNA was puri ﬁ ed using the RNAeasy MinElute Kit ( Qiagen ) . Ribodepleted RNA ( 10 ng ) was subjected to strand - speci ﬁ c library preparation with the SureSelect Strand - Speci ﬁ c Library Preparation Kit ( G9691A , Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . For high - throughput RNA sequencing , six samples were multiplexed on one lane and a 100 base - pair paired - end protocol was applied on the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform ( Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility of the DKFZ , Heidelberg , Germany ) . After quality control and adapter trimming with fastqc and cutadapt , 112 the sequences were aligned using HISAT2 ( ref . 113 ) with the following parameters : — rna - strandness RF , — max - intronlen 20000 , — no - unal , — dta .
