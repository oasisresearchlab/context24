scattering realization . Also plotted in Fig . 3 for comparison are results from effective me - dium theories ( 22 , 23 ) , which depend only on the porosity and refractive index ratio . The morphology of the scattering material deter - mines which effective medium model is ap - plicable ( 22 ) . Maxwell Garnett theory was developed for spherical scatterers in a homo - geneous dielectric background ( 22 ) , whereas Bruggeman’s approach ( 16 ) treats both di - electric components on a symmetrical basis and seems to be the better choice for porous GaP . Both the porosity and the refractive index ratios of our samples are known . The two effective medium theories are compared with experimental results without any adjust - able parameters . As can be seen , our mea - surements are not quantitatively described by existing effective medium models , which prompts the need to develop new theories . In fact , an effective medium approach is not expected to apply , because it was developed for weakly scattering media with s , , l and relatively small m . It is therefore not surpris - ing that the discrepancy between theory and experiment is largest for the most strongly scattering material , PA - GaP . As observed , a relatively small decrease in refractive index ratio , from 3 . 26 to 2 . 12 , leads to a large modification of the scattering efficiency , es - tablishing the importance of the refractive index ratio for strongly photonic materials .

Marshak 1 , 2 Human mesenchymal stem cells are thought to be multipotent cells , which are present in adult marrow , that can replicate as undifferentiated cells and that have the potential to differentiate to lineages of mesenchymal tissues , including bone , cartilage , fat , tendon , muscle , and marrow stroma . Cells that have the characteristics of human mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from marrow aspirates of volunteer donors . These cells displayed a stable phenotype and remained as a monolayer in vitro . These adult stem cells could be induced to differentiate exclusively into the adipocytic , chondrocytic , or osteocytic lin - eages . Individual stem cells were identi(cid:222)ed that , when expanded to colonies , retained their multilineage potential . Recently , pluripotent stem cells have been cultured from human fetal tissue and have shown the ability to give rise to a variety of differentiated cell types found in embryonic germ layers ( 1 ) . Many adult tissues contain populations of stem cells that have the capac - ity for renewal after trauma , disease , or aging . The cells may be found within the tissue or in other tissues that serve as stem cell reservoirs . For example , although bone marrow is the major source of adult hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) that renew circulating blood elements , these cells can be found in other tissues ( 2 ) . The adult bone marrow also con - tains mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) , which contribute to the regeneration of mesenchy - mal tissues such as bone , cartilage , muscle , ligament , tendon , adipose , and stroma ( 3 – 5 ) . In vitro and animal implant studies ( 5 – 10 ) have indicated that there is either a multipo - tent MSC or the populations are mixtures of committed progenitor cells , each with re - stricted potential . We report the isolation , expansion , and characterization of the multi - potent human MSC ( hMSC ) . We characterized an isolated population of homogeneous human mesenchymal cells from bone marrow taken from the iliac crest ( 5 ) ( see Web Fig . 1 , available at www . sciencemag . org / feature / data / 983855 . shl ) . Previous studies have identified selection cri - teria for fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) that allows the expansion of a marrow cell population with MSC potential after implantation ( 5 , 11 ) . The mesenchymal cells described here were characterized by their ability to prolif - erate in culture with an attached well - spread morphology ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) , by the pres - ence of a consistent set of marker proteins on their surface ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) ( 12 – 14 ) , and by their extensive consistent differentiation to multiple mesenchymal lineages under con - trolled in vitro conditions ( Fig . 2 ) . A density gradient was used in the isola - tion procedure to eliminate unwanted cell types that were present in the marrow aspi - rate . A small percentage ( estimated at about 0 . 001 to 0 . 01 % ) of cells isolated from the density interface of 1 . 073 g / ml attached and grew as fibroblastic cells that developed into 1 Osiris Therapeutics , 2001 Aliceanna Street , Balti - more , MD 21231—3043 , USA . 2 Johns Hopkins Univer - sity , School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD 21205 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

HSCs and nonadher - ent cells were removed with changes in me - dium . The isolated cultured mesenchymal cells comprised a single phenotypic popula - tion ( 95 and 98 % homogeneous at passages 1 and 2 , respectively ) by flow cytometric anal - ysis of expressed surface antigens ; whether or not trypsin was used to remove the cells from the substrate did not change the results . These expanded attached mesenchymal cells were uniformly positive for SH2 , SH3 , CD29 , CD44 , CD71 , CD90 , CD106 , CD120a , CD124 , and many other surface proteins . Im - munofluorescence microscopy evaluation showed no unlabeled cells . No subpopula - tions of marrow - derived mesenchymal cells could be discerned morphologically by mi - croscopic observation or by fluorescence cy - tometry , size , and granularity criteria , or with more than 50 available antibodies ( 11 , 13 , 14 ) ( see Web Fig . 1 ) . Several of these anti - bodies were used to routinely characterize the expanded mesenchymal cell population . In contrast , the mesenchymal cells were negative for other markers of the hematopoietic lineage , including the lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14 , CD34 , and the leukocyte common anti - gen CD45 ( Fig . 1D ) . Hematopoietic cells were never identified in the expanded cultures . The mesenchymal cells appear to be different from marrow fibroblastic cells isolated by other cells that remained positive for the CD34 surface antigen ( 15 ) . As many as 50 million to 375 million cells were generated by passage 2 from a 10 - ml marrow aspirate that was obtained from 19 - to 57 - year - old donors ( see Web Fig . 1 ) . This range of yield is expected for the expan - sion of primary cells . We isolated these cells from the marrow of over 350 donors , and the expanded mesenchymal cells from at least 50 donors were tested in three lineage assays , with all tested donors responding positively in these assays . The cells did not differentiate spontane - ously during culture expansion . Similarly iso - lated marrow mesenchymal cells maintained a normal karyotype and telomerase activity , even at passage 12 ( see Web Fig . 1 ) . The differentiation potential of the mes - enchymal cells from three adult donors were compared to two strains of human fibroblasts ( 16 ) , which are other cells of mesenchymal lineage , by culturing the cells under condi - tions that were favorable for adipogenic , chondrogenic , or osteogenic differentiation . After 1 to 3 weeks in lineage - specific culture conditions , the expanded cells from the three donors were highly differentiated ( the pheno - type of lineage - specific cell types was easily distinguished ) , without evidence of the other lineages ( Fig . 2 , A through I ) . Adipogenic differentiation was induced in the expanded mesenchymal cell cultures by treatment with 1 - methyl - 3 - isobutylxanthine , dexamethasone , insulin , and indomethacin ( 17 ) . Induction was apparent by the accumu - lation of lipid - rich vacuoles within cells ( Fig . 2 , A , D , and G ) . These adipocytes expressed peroxisome proliferation - activated receptor g 2 ( PPAR g 2 ) , lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) , and the fatty acid – binding protein aP2 ( 18 ) ( see Web Fig . 2 , available at www . sciencemag . org / feature / data / 983855 . shl ) . Multiple induc - tion treatments resulted in more than 95 % of the cells committing to this lineage , and the lipid vacuoles continued to develop over time , coalesced , and eventually filled the cell . These adipocytes remained healthy in culture for at least 3 months . To promote chondrogenic differentiation , we gently centrifuged the isolated mesenchy - mal cells to form a pelleted micromass and cultured the cells without serum and with transforming growth factor – b 3 ( 19 ) . The cell pellets developed a multilayered matrix - rich morphology and histologically showed an in - creased proteoglycan - rich extracellular ma - trix during culture . Type II collagen ( Fig . 2 , B , E , and H ) , which is typical of articular cartilage , was detected at 10 to 14 days with monoclonal C4F6 ( 20 ) . For each donor , the cells showed a positive stain for chondrocytic markers over an increasing proportion of the pellet from 10 to 21 days , and this persisted without decreasing . Similar cultures have been maintained for 3 months . Chondrocyte - like lacunae were evident in histological sec - tions , and the extensive extracellular matrix was rich in aggrecan and type II collagen ( see Fig . 1 .

Cells were cultured from marrow after density fractionation and are shown ( A ) at 48 hours after plating and ( B ) at 10 days af - ter plating . ( C ) Flow cytometry shows the enrichment of these cells as they were cul - tured . Results shown were obtained at days 2 , 5 , and 14 of culture with antibodies SH2 and SH3 , which were raised against surface markers ( 11 ) . At 14 days , the cells were 95 to 99 % homoge - neous and were neg - ative for reactivity to antigens CD14 , CD34 ( Becton - Dickinson ) , or CD45 ( Pharmin - gen ) , which are com - mon on cells of the hematopoietic lineag - es .

The osteogenic differentiation of cultured human mesenchymal cells that were derived from adult bone marrow has been character - ized ( 3 , 21 ) . Under the influence of dexa - methasone , b - glycerol phosphate , and ascor - bate and in the presence of 10 % v / v FBS , the isolated mesenchymal cells formed aggre - gates or nodules and increased their expres - sion of alkaline phosphatase ( Fig . 2 , C , F , and I ) . Quantitative assays revealed a 4 - to 10 - fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity , and calcium accumulation was evident after 1 week and increased over time ( see Web Fig . 4 , available at www . sciencemag . org / feature / data / 983855 . shl ) . As differentiation to the three lineages occurred , there was no evidence of necrosis or apoptosis ; it is apparent when groups of dead cells are present because there are no scavenger cells to remove them . However , we cannot rule out the fact that apoptosis may occur on a single - cell basis . In contrast , cultured normal skin fibro - blasts did not undergo any such differentia - tion when cultured for as long as 28 days , although the cells appeared healthy and non - necrotic in these different conditions ( Fig . 2 , K and N ) . Cultured hMSCs , therefore , had a differentiation capacity that was not present in primary fibroblasts , which are mature mes - enchymal cells . The entire culture of expanded mesenchy - mal cells appeared to progress to the desired lineage , on the basis of phenotypic character - ization and histological analysis . Multiple lineages were not present . To further test the possibility that a barely detectable population of cells could differentiate to lineages other than those desired in the in vitro assays , we isolated RNA from cells after differentiation , and reverse transcriptase – polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) was used to amplify ex - pressed transcripts from multiple genes whose expression is restricted to the adipo - cytic ( PPAR g 2 and aP2 ) , chondrocytic ( type II and IX collagens ) , or osteocytic ( osteopon - tin and alkaline phosphatase ) lineage ( see Web Fig . 5 , available at www . sciencemag . org / feature / data / 983855 . shl ) . The sensitive RT - PCR assays , in addition to the immuno - logical and histochemical data , showed that neither the adipogenic nor the osteogenic cul - tures were composed of cells of multiple lineages . The chondrogenic cultures did not appear histologically to contain cells that were of the other lineages , but they did ex - press osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase . These experiments showed that the isolated expanded hMSC culture would differentiate , in a controlled manner , to multiple lineages . To test the hypothesis that marrow contains indi - vidual hMSCs that could differentiate to all three of the lineages and to rule out that marrow contains only committed progenitor cells , we performed the same experiments with expand - ed colonies of cells derived from single cells . For this , the Percoll - isolated marrow cells were plated at 1 . 5 million to 6 million cells per 150 - mm dish . Individual adherent cells were identified at 24 hours and grown into colonies of 30 to 100 cells , and the colonies were iso - lated with cloning rings . Isolated colonies were treated with trypsin and transferred to individ - ual wells of a 24 - well tissue culture plate and then transferred to a 75 - cm 2 flask as they ex - panded . Approximately 800 , 000 to 1 , 500 , 000 cells were obtained from the flasks at harvest , representing 19 to 21 in vitro population dou - blings from the original cell . The cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis and in vitro differentiation assays . Flow analysis of the colonies revealed the same surface molecules as those found on the cultured undifferentiated hMSCs from which they were derived ( Fig . 3 ) and on the other donors that were studied ( Fig . 1 ) . Of the six colonies derived from clonal cells , all under - went osteogenic differentiation , five under - went adipogenic differentiation , and two also underwent chondrogenic differentiation ( Fig . 4 ) . One other colony was weakly but clearly positive for the chondrocytic phenotype . The fact that some of the marrow - derived adult human mesenchymal cells , which were grown and expanded as individual colonies , possessed a multipotent capacity for lineage differentiation supports our conclusion that these cells represent human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs ) . The observation that some colonies displayed limited differentia - tion under these experimental conditions has several possible interpretations . For example , the clonal cell isolation , 19 to 21 population doublings , and in vitro culture conditions may have caused some loss of multilineage potential that was originally present in these cells . Another interpretation is that some of these cells might represent progenitor cells , with restricted differentiation potential , that are present in adult marrow . The specific environmental cues to initiate the proliferation and differentiation of hMSCs in vivo are not understood . The ability to isolate , expand the culture , and direct the differentiation of hMSCs in vitro to particular lineages provides the opportunity to study events associated with commitment and dif - Adipo Chondro Osteo A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O Fig . 2 .

Donors ( A through C ) 158 , ( D through F ) 177 , and ( G through I ) 260 were each shown to differ - entiate appropriately to the adipogenic ( Adipo ) , chondrogenic ( Chondro ) , and osteo - genic ( Osteo ) lineages .

From the different assay condi - tions required for efficient differentiation , we conclude that basal nutrients , cell density , spatial organization , mechanical forces , and growth factors and cytokines have a profound influence on hMSC differentiation . The hMSCs cultured in each of the differentiation condi - tions may also produce autocrine and para - crine factors that are essential for lineage progression . As for the differentiation to oth - er mesenchymal lineages , expanded mesen - chymal cells have been shown to function as stromal cells for the in vitro support of HSCs ( 13 ) , and rabbit MSCs have been shown to be effective for the regeneration of a severed tendon in a rabbit model ( 8 ) . The hMSCs described here have the abil - ity to proliferate extensively , and they main - tain the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types in vitro , establishing their stem cell nature . Their cultivation and selective differ - entiation should provide further understand - ing of this important progenitor of multiple tissue types and the potential of new thera - peutic approaches for the restoration of dam - aged or diseased tissue .

The endothelial monocyte—activating polypeptide II—like carboxy - terminal domain has potent leukocyte and monocyte chemotaxis activity and stimulates production of myeloperoxidase , tumor necrosis factor - a , and tissue factor . The catalytic amino - terminal domain binds to the interleukin - 8 type A receptor and functions as an interleukin - 8—like cytokine . Under apoptotic conditions in cell culture , the full - length enzyme is secreted , and the two cytokine activities can be generated by leukocyte elastase , an extracellular protease . Se - cretion of this tRNA synthetase may contribute to apoptosis both by arresting translation and producing needed cytokines . Aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases are ancient proteins that are essential for decoding genet - ic information in translation . In higher eu - karyotes , nine aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases associate with at least three other polypep - tides to form a supramolecular multienzyme complex ( 1 ) . Each of these nine eukaryotic tRNA synthetases has an additional domain appended to the NH 2 - or COOH - terminal end of the core enzyme , which itself is closely related to the respective prokaryotic counter - part ( 2 ) . In most cases , the appended domains appear to contribute to the assembly of the multienzyme complex ( 2 ) . However , the presence of an extra domain is not strictly correlated with the association of a synthetase into the multienzyme complex . For example , human tyrosyl - tRNA synthetase ( TyrRS ) has an extra domain at the COOH - terminus com - pared to prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic TyrRSs ( Fig . 1 ) ( 3 ) , and bovine and rabbit TyrRSs are also suggested to contain an extra domain ( 4 ) . Yet , higher eukaryotic TyrRS is not a component of the multienzyme complex ( 1 ) . Interestingly , the COOH - terminal do - main of human TyrRS has 51 % sequence identity to the mature form of human endo - thelial monocyte – activating polypeptide II ( EMAP II ) ( 3 ) . TyrRS is the only higher eukaryotic aminoacyl - tRNA synthetase known to contain an EMAP II – like domain . In initial experiments , we found that this domain was dispensable for aminoacylation in vitro and in yeast ( 5 – 7 ) . EMAP II is a proinflammatory cytokine that was initially identified as a product of murine methylcholanthrene A – induced fibro - sarcoma cells ( 8 ) . Pro – EMAP II is cleaved and is secreted from apoptotic cells to pro - duce a biologically active 22 - kD mature cy - tokine ( 8 , 9 ) . The mature EMAP II can in - duce migration of mononuclear phagocytes ( MPs ) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) ; it also stimulates the production of tumor necrosis factor - a ( TNF a ) and tissue factor by MPs and the release of myeloper - oxidase from PMNs ( 8 ) . We investigated each of these five activ - ities with the cloned COOH - terminal domain of human TyrRS and with the full - length enzyme that contains the COOH - terminal do - main fused to the catalytic core ( 5 ) . The COOH - terminal domain induced migration of human MPs from peripheral blood ( 10 ) to an extent comparable to that seen with mature human EMAP II ( Fig . 2A ) . In contrast , no chemotaxis was observed with the full - length TyrRS . The COOH - terminal domain of TyrRS also stimulated TNF a and MP tissue factor activities ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , induced release of PMN myeloperoxidase activity in the peroxidase generation assay ( Fig . 2B ) , and induced PMN migration in chemotaxis chambers ( Fig . 2C ) . The induction of PMN migration by the COOH - terminal domain and mature EMAP II showed the bell - shaped con - centration dependence that is characteristic of chemotactic cytokines ( 7 , 11 ) . Human full - length TyrRS had none of these properties ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . We also investigated the NH 2 - terminal catalytic domain ( mini TyrRS ) in the same assays . Human “mini” TyrRS did not induce migration of MPs and did not stimulate TNF a and tissue factor production by MPs ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Surprisingly , incubation of PMNs with mini TyrRS induced PMN migra - tion ( Fig . 2C ) , and this activity showed a bell - shaped concentration dependence ( 7 ) .
