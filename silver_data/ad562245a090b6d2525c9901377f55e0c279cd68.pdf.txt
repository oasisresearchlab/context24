Participants were 62 youth campers ( Age M = 13 . 45 years , SD = 2 . 41 ) with a variety of chronic illnesses . For youth who began camp low in hope about future goal attainment , participation in optional camp activities negatively predicted post - camp hope about future goal attainment . This relation was nonsigni ﬁ cant for campers who began camp high in hope . We found no signi ﬁ cant changes in attitude toward illness or perceptions of illness bene ﬁ t or bur - den . This study provides an important contribution to burgeoning research on summer camps designed for chil - dren with varying chronic illnesses . Findings were inconsistent with previous studies on chronic illness summer camp outcomes . Further work is needed to identify camp components that are related to desirable psychosocial outcomes for youth with chronic illnesses . © 2018 Elsevier Inc . All rights reserved . Keywords : Chronic illness Psychosocial factors Children Summer camps Introduction Researchers estimate that 15 – 18 % of children have a chronic illness ( Judson , 2004 ; van der Lee , Mokkink , Grootenhuis , Heymans , & Offringa , 2007 ) . Although advances in diagnostic accuracy and medical treatments have improved long - term survival rates for many childhood chronic illnesses , a signi ﬁ cant subset of children with chronic illness are at risk for long - term psychosocial adjustment dif ﬁ culties ( Zashikhina & Hagglof , 2007 ) . Health professionals have utilized a variety of preven - tion and intervention programs to improve psychosocial adjustment in youth with chronic illnesses . Summer camps designed speci ﬁ cally for youth who have chronic illnesses have received increased attention as a potential context in which to improve youths ' social , physical , and emotional wellbeing ( Epstein , Stinson , & Stevens , 2005 ) . Yet , few stud - ieshaveempiricallyevaluatedpsychosocialoutcomesofsummercamps designed for chronically - ill youth . Additionally , studies that have evaluated camp outcomes have fo - cused almost exclusively on camps designed for speci ﬁ c illness popula - tions . Recent healthcare reform highlights the need for more ef ﬁ cient use of resources and a greater emphasis on preventative care ( Zirui & Lee , 2013 ) . Because camps designed to serve a variety of illness populations may provide a more ef ﬁ cient use of resources compared to illness - speci ﬁ c camps , systematic evaluations of nonspeci ﬁ c - illness summer camps are needed ( Epstein et al . , 2005 ; Woods , Mayes , Bartley , Fedele , & Ryan , 2013 ) . This study evaluated changes in hope , at - titude toward illness , and perceptions of illness bene ﬁ t and burden fol - lowing participation in a summer camp designed for youth with a variety of chronic illnesses . Our ﬁ ndings juxtapose ﬁ ndings from previ - ous research and highlight the need for further evaluation and re ﬁ ne - ment of youth chronic - illness summer camp curriculum . Summer Camps for Youth With Chronic Illnesses Children and adolescents , herein ‘ youth , ’ with chronic illnesses can face limited opportunities to participate in traditional summer camps because of their increased need for medical monitoring and their phys - ical limitations ( Sawin , Lannon , & Austin , 2001 ) . In response to exclu - sion from traditional summer camps , a number of patient advocate groups and medical service providers have developed summer camps designedspeci ﬁ callyforchildrenwhohavechronicillnesses . Inaddition to using therapeutic recreation to improve campers ' quality of life ( Jamison , Lewis , & Burish , 1986 ; Moola , Faulkner , White , & Kirsh , 2014 ) , many chronic illness camps also include activities designed to enhance disease - related knowledge and skills , self - esteem , social en - gagement , and overall psychosocial functioning in a recreational and age - normative context ( Hunter , Rosnov , Koontz , & Roberts , 2006 ; Rimmer et al . , 2007 ; Walker & Pearman , 2009 ) .

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Pediatric Nursing youth attendance at chronic illness summer camps has steadily increased over the past several years ( Epstein et al . , 2005 ; Hunter et al . , 2006 ; Maslow & Lobato , 2009 ; Nicholas , Williams , & MacLusky , 2009 ) , with over 280 accredited camps for children with chronic illnesses in existence today ( Wu , Prout , Roberts , Parikshak , & Amylon , 2011 ) . Despitetheorizedbene ﬁ tsofcampattendance , fewstudieshaveem - pirically evaluated whether summer camps designed for youth with chronic illnesses meet their stated goals ( Woods et al . , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2011 ) . Of studies that have evaluated outcomes of chronic illness summer camps , most have focused on camps designed for speci ﬁ c ill - ness populations . For example , Pulgaron , Salamon , Patterson , and Barakat ( 2010 ) found that youths who attended an asthma - speci ﬁ c summer camp demonstrated improved problem - solving and asthma knowledge at the end of camp and at three - months follow - up . Shepanski et al . ( 2005 ) evaluated a camp for children with in ﬂ amma - tory bowel disease and found camp attendance was related to campers ' improved overall health - related quality of life , social functioning , and bowel symptoms . Several studies evaluating summer camps designed for children and adolescents with cancer and their siblings found that camp attendance is associated with improvements in overall distress , social competence , health - related quality of life , and perceived peer ac - ceptance among both patients and siblings ( Meltzer & Rourke , 2005 ; Packman et al . , 2005 ; Sidhu , Passmore , & Baker , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2011 ) . Few published studies have evaluated youth outcomes after attend - ing a summer camp designed for children who have a variety of chronic illnesses . Woods et al . ( 2013 ) evaluated pre - camp to post - camp changes in self - reported health - related quality of life for youth attend - ing such a summer camp . Campers in that study included youth with cancer , renal disease , hematological disorders , gastrointestinal disor - ders , and other chronic illnesses . Woods and colleagues found that campers demonstrated improvements in hope but did not demonstrate statistically signi ﬁ cantchanges in self - reported health - related quality of life . Further investigation is warranted to further explain these ﬁ ndings . AccordingtoEpsteinetal . ( 2005 ) , chronicillnesssummercampsim - prove campers ' social , physical , and emotional well - being via two pro - cesses : ( 1 ) by providing opportunities for campers to interact with each other , and ( 2 ) by allowing participation in modi ﬁ ed but age - normative summer activities ( Epstein et al . , 2005 ) . Some researchers have suggested that camp attendance can improve campers ' sense of mastery and self - esteem , which could also lead to youths ' enhanced hope about the future ( Warady , Carr , Hellerstein , & Alon , 1992 ; Woods et al . , 2013 ) . Further study is warranted to more fully under - stand the associations between opportunities for social engagement and participation in age - normative activities at camp and psychosocial factors associated with healthy adjustment . Because chronic - illness camps aim to promote wellbeing among campers , there is bene ﬁ t in examining cognitive and emotional changes amongcamperswhoexperiencethesocialandbehavioralopportunities at camp . Hope theory was established by Snyder ( 1995 ) as a process of conceptualizing goals into cognitive and emotional components that constitute overall hope . Snyder , Irving , andAnderson ( 1991 , p . 287 ) fur - ther de ﬁ ne hope as “ a positive motivational state that is based on an in - teractively derived sense of successful ( a ) agency ( goal directed energy ) , and ( b ) pathways ( planning to meet goals ) . ” Based on this def - inition , the agency component of hope is identi ﬁ ed asanindividual ' s be - liefs about his or her ability to attain goals and the pathways component of hope is de ﬁ ned as an individual ' s con ﬁ dence in his or her ability to identify strategies to accomplish goals ( Snyder et al . , 1997 ) . In this sense , hope is identi ﬁ ed as “ a cognitive appraisal of one ' s goal - related capabilities ” ( Snyder , 1995 ) . Previous research has found that hope is inversely related to symptoms of depression and anxiety and positively related to adaptive coping strategies in youth who have chronic ill - nesses ( Lewis & Kliewer , 1996 ; Maikranz , Steele , Dreyer , Stratman , & Bovaird , 2007 ) . Youth cognitive appraisals about their chronic illness are related to psychosocial adjustment , and such ﬁ ndings have led to the development of speci ﬁ c measures for evaluating cognitive ap - praisals about pediatric chronic illness , speci ﬁ cally attitude toward ill - ness and perceptions of illness bene ﬁ t and burden ( Currier , Hermes , & Phipps , 2009 ; Ramsey et al . , 2016 ) . The Current Study Burgeoning evidence suggests that youth bene ﬁ t from attending illness - speci ﬁ c summer camps ( Meltzer & Rourke , 2005 ; Packman et al . , 2005 ; Sidhu et al . , 2006 ; Pulgaron et al . , 2010 ; Shepanski et al . , 2005 ; Woods et al . , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2011 ) ; yet , literature assessing psy - chosocial outcomes of summer camps designed for youth with a variety of chronic illnesses remains scant . Healthcare reform in the United States promotes more ef ﬁ cient use of resources and greater emphasis on serving larger patient populations ( Zirui & Lee , 2013 ) . Non - speci ﬁ c illness camps have the potential to provide an economical approach to addressing psychosocial needs in a variety of illness populations com - pared to illness - speci ﬁ c camps ; thus , researchers have recommended further evaluation of psychosocial outcomes associated with non - speci ﬁ c illness camps ( Hunter et al . , 2006 ; Plante , Lobato , & Engel , 2001 ) . The current study evaluated psychosocial changes associated with attendance at a summer camp designed for youth with a variety of chronic illnesses . Speci ﬁ cally , this study evaluated changes in campers ' hope , attitude toward illness , and perceptions of illness - related bene ﬁ t and burden . Additionally , campers ' participation in camp activities , which were designed to promote camp goals , was eval - uated . We hypothesized that campers ' hope , attitude toward illness , and perceptions of illness bene ﬁ ts would improve following camp at - tendance . We expected campers ' perceptions about illness burden to decrease following camp . Because we theorized that campers ' success - ful participation in camp activities would allow for the greatest im - provements in campers ' sense of mastery and self - ef ﬁ cacy , we expected that number of activities would predict increases in hope , at - titudes about illness , and perceptions of illness bene ﬁ ts , and a decrease in perceptions of illness burden . Method Participants Participants included 62 children and adolescents ( mean age ( SD ) = 13 . 45 ( 2 . 41 ) ; 48 . 4 % male ) who attended a 5 - day summer camp in the Midwest United States designed for youth with chronic illnesses . All campers were invited to participate . Of the 84 eligible campers , 8 campers ' parents declined to participate in this study . To be included in analyses , campers must have completed pre - and post - camp mea - sures for at least one dependent variable . Based on this criteria , an addi - tional 14 youth were excluded from analyses due to not completing a pre - or post - camp questionnaire packet ( resulting in total N = 62 ) . Par - ticipating youths ' illnesses included cancer or brain tumor ( 34 . 4 % ) , sickle cell disease ( 13 . 1 % ) , renal disease ( 26 . 2 % ) , heart disease ( 6 . 6 % ) , and other chronic illnesses ( 19 . 7 % ) . Additional demographic informa - tion is provided in Table 1 . Compliance With Ethical Standards All procedures performed were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and / or national research commit - tee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards . Informed consent and child / adoles - cent assent were obtained from all individual participants included in the study . This study was approved by the af ﬁ liated university ' s institu - tional review board . 57 M . A . Faith et al . / Journal of Pediatric Nursing 44 ( 2019 ) 56 – 62 Measures Demographic Form Oneparentperchild completed a demographicquestionnairedevel - oped for this study . The questionnaire contains 9 items assessing child demographics ( e . g . , age , race , education level , prior camp attendance ) and4 items assessingparentdemographics ( e . g . , maritalstatus , parents ' educational levels ) . Children ' s Hope Scale ( CHS ; Snyder et al . , 1997 ) The CHS is a 6 - item self - report measure of dispositional hope in youth ages 8 to 19 years . The CHS is based on Snyder ' s ( 1995 ) hope the - ory and consists of two subscales : agency and pathways . The agency subscale assesses youths ' beliefs about their ability to accomplish goals . The pathways subscale assesses youths ' con ﬁ dence that their ac - tions will help them to achieve their goals . Because hope theory differ - entiates these as constructs , the subscales were analyzed as separate variables . Youth rate each item on a 6 - point scale ( 1 = none of the time , 6 = all of the time ) , with higher scores indicating greater levels of hope . Subscale scores are computed by summing the three items that load on each subscale . The CHS has yielded good reliability in pre - vious studies ( Snyder et al . , 1997 ; Woods et al . , 2013 ) . Subscale internal consistency estimates were adequate to good in this study ( agency time 1 α = 0 . 81 , time2 α = 0 . 76 ; pathwaystime1 α = 0 . 87 , time2 α = 73 ) . Child Attitude Toward Illness Scale ( CATIS ; Austin & Huberty , 1993 ) The CATIS is a 13 - item self - report questionnaire designed to assess youths ' feelings about having a chronic illness ( Austin & Huberty , 1993 ) . Respondents are asked to rate , using a 5 - point scale ( 1 = never , 5 = very often ) , how often they have negative and positive thoughts abouttheir illness . ThetotalCATIS score is computed by taking the arithmetic average of all items , with higher scores indicating a more positive attitude toward illness . The CATIS has demonstrated moderate to high internal reliability ( Iobst , Nabors , Brunner , & Precht , 2007 ; LeBovidge , Lavigne , & Miller , 2005 ; Ramsey , Bonner , Ryan , Mullins , & Chaney , 2013 ; Shore , Buelow , Austin , & Johnson , 2009 ) and test - retest reliability ( Ramsey et al . , 2013 ) in previous studies . The CATIS demon - strated good internal consistency in this study ( time 1 α = 0 . 83 ; time 1 α = 0 . 87 ) . Bene ﬁ t and Burden Scale for Children ( BBSC ; Currier et al . , 2009 ) The BBSC is a 20 - item self - report questionnaire designed to assess perceptions of bene ﬁ t and burden related to havinga childhood chronic illness . Respondents are asked to rate each item on a 5 - point scale ( 1 = not at all ; 5 = very much ) . The BBSC contains two subscales : Bene ﬁ t ( 9 items ) and Burden ( 11 items ) . Subscale scores are computed by sum - ming items that load on each subscale ; higher subscale scores indicate greater perceptions of bene ﬁ t or burden , respectively . The Bene ﬁ t and Burden subscales yielded good concurrent validity and internal consis - tency in the BBSC initial validation study ( Currier et al . , 2009 ) . The sub - scales demonstrated good internal consistency in this study ( Bene ﬁ t Finding time 1 α = 0 . 89 , time 2 α = 0 . 92 ; Burden time 1 α = 0 . 83 , time 2 α = 0 . 92 ) . Items were summed to compute subscale scores . Number of Camp Activities Children completed a measure developed for this study to assess participation in optional activities at camp . Campers were presented with a list of possible camp activities and were asked to indicate whether they participated ( 1 = yes , 2 = no ) in each activity . In this study , we indexed each camper ' s participation in camp activities by summing the number of optional activities in which campers reported participating . Procedure Specialty clinic medical teams within the children ' s hospital were encouraged to refer campers . Eligibility criteria for camp attendance in - cluded having a chronic illness ( as determined by the specialty clinic medical team ) and the ability to function independently ( e . g . , toileting , followingspeci ﬁ cdietaryrequirements , capacitytointer - act acceptably with others ) and an age range of 9 to 18 years . The camp ishostedbyanon - pro ﬁ tagencyaf ﬁ liatedwiththehospitalandclinicsat the hospital are provided with information and encouraged to invite their patients . Anyone in the community who has a child with a life threatening or chronic illness may be eligible , regardless of whether they receive treatment at the local hospital or not . No incentives were offered for participation in the study . Campers were provided informa - tion about the study during the camp enrollment process and given the opportunity to complete forms and provide consent and assent to par - ticipate and for parental data collection when campers arrived for camp . The campers completed their study questionnaires on the bus ride to camp ( approximately 2 . 5 h in duration ) or at camp check - in for campers arriving directly at the camp . Parents completed the demo - graphic form at the camp registration . Youth completed the CHS , BBSC , and CATIS at two time points ( i . e . , on the bus while riding to camp ) and in their cabins on the last evening of camp ( prior to the camp dance ; camp was concluded mid - day of the following day ) . Youth also com - pleted the activity participation self - report form during the allotted time on the last night of camp . Counselors provided assistance with questionnaire completion as needed to accommodate any physical or cognitive de ﬁ cits . The activity participation self - report form was based on scheduled camp activities . Every day during camp , all campers met as a group for seminars about illness acceptance , bene ﬁ t - ﬁ nding , and goal - setting . All campers also participated in two ﬁ shing trips , two talent shows , an in ﬂ atable water - slide carnival , and a social dance at scheduled times duringcamp .

Each day of camp , youth were given 3 to 5 h of free time during which they could choose to participate in one or more additional activities . Optional activities in - cluded social and recreational activities ( e . g . , jewelry making , Table 1 Demographic information .

Campers could also chooseto stayintheir camp cabin duringfree timeinstead of participat - ing in optional activities or to focus on one or two activities rather than engaging in many optional camp activities . Data Analytic Plan Data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 24 . Data were screened for multivariate normal distribution , linearity , and outliers . No statistical assumption violations were found . We used paired - samples t - tests to compare youths ' hope subscale scores ( i . e . , agency and pathways ) , attitude toward illness , and perceptions of illness bene ﬁ t and burden from the beginning of camp to the end of camp . Consistent with Judd , Kenny , and McClelland ' s ( 2001 ) recom - mendations for testing moderation in repeated measures , we used ﬁ ve separate hierarchical regression analyses to examine whether campers ' participation in optional camp activities predicted changes in the ﬁ ve dependent variables . In all planned regression analyses , campers ' num - ber of optional activities was regressed on difference scores ( post camp score – precampscore ) fortheprimaryvariable . Weexaminedbivariate correlations between dependent variables and the following possible covariates : age , gender , diagnosis . Only gender and diagnosis were sig - ni ﬁ cantly correlated with any dependent variables , so regression analy - ses controlled for gender and diagnosis . Number of activities was centered before being entered into the regression equations . Order of entry for independent variables was as follows : ( Step 1 ) gender and di - agnosis , and ( Step 2 ) number of optional activities in which the youth reported participating . We interpreted p b . 05 as statistically signi ﬁ cant in a priori planned analyses . Results Pre - post Changes in Hope , Attitude Toward Illness , and Perceptions of Ill - ness Bene ﬁ t and Burden Table 2 presents means and standard deviations for campers ' hope scores ( i . e . , agency and pathways ) , attitude toward illness , and percep - tions of illness bene ﬁ t and burden at the beginning and end of camp . Table 2 also includes the results of paired - groups t - tests comparing pre - and post - scores . Attitude toward illness signi ﬁ cantly declined from pre - to post - camp with a large effect size ( Cohen , 1988 ) . We found no signi ﬁ cant changes in hope agency or pathways , or percep - tions of illness bene ﬁ t or burden from pre - to post - camp . Number of Activities as a Moderator of Change Table 3 presents results of planned hierarchical regression analyses . Number of activities positively predicted post - camp hope agency with small effect size ( Cohen , 1988 ) . Number of activities did not predict changes in campers ' hope pathways , attitude toward illness , or percep - tions of illness bene ﬁ t or burden . Exploratory Post - hoc Analyses Number ofactivities didnot explainchanges inhope agencyorpath - ways , attitudes toward illness , or perceptions of illness bene ﬁ t or bur - den . Thus , we also considered whether an overall effect of participatinginoptionalactivitieswassuppressedduetomanycampers beginning camp with relatively positive attitudes and beliefs . Due to a potentialceilingeffectforcamperswhobegancampwithrelativelypos - itive beliefs about illness and the future , we hypothesized that partici - pating in optional camp activities might predict changes in psychosocial functioning only for campers who began camp with rela - tively poor attitudes toward illness , lower levels of hope , and fewer per - ceptions of illness bene ﬁ t or with relatively strong perceptions of illness burden . To test this posthoc hypothesis , we conducted ﬁ ve separate ex - ploratory hierarchical regression analyses to provide insight for future hypothesis testing in other camp settings . Predictor variables were cen - tered before being entered into the regression equation and before in - teraction terms were computed . Order of entry was as follows : ( Step 1 ) pre - camp score on the dependent variable , ( Step 2 ) number of op - tional activities in which the youth reported participating , and ( Step 3 ) the interaction between pre - camp score on the dependent variable and number of optional activities . Because of the exploratory post - hoc nature of these regression analyses , we interpreted ﬁ ndings with p b . 05 as statistically signi ﬁ cant and p b . 10 as approaching statistical signi ﬁ cance . The interaction between number of activities and pre - camp hope agency was a positive predictor of post - camp hope agency , explaining an additional 7 % of the variance . We used Holmbeck ' s ( 2002 ) recom - mendations to probe the signi ﬁ cant interaction . For youth who began camp relatively high in hope agency ( N 1 SD above the mean ) , number of activities was negatively but nonsigni ﬁ cantly predictive of post - camp hope agency scores , β = − 0 . 46 , t ( 48 ) = − 1 . 55 , p = . 13 . For youth who began camp relatively low in hope agency ( N 1 SD below the mean ) , number of activities approached statistical signi ﬁ cance as a negative predictor of post - camp hope agency scores , β = − 0 . 95 , t ( 48 ) Table 2 Summary of t - tests predicting changes in hope and perceptions of illness .

Discussion Summer camps for youth who have chronic illnesses are becoming more prominent in the United States ( Epstein et al . , 2005 ) . Most camps are designed with the intention of enhancing campers ' social in - teractions and self - con ﬁ dence by providing opportunities to expand their social networks , to interact with other youth with chronic ill - nesses , and to gain mastery of camp activities ( Hunter et al . , 2006 ; Jamison et al . , 1986 ; Rimmer etal . , 2007 ; Walker & Pearman , 2009 ) . No - tably , summercampsforyouthwithchronicillnessrequirealargenum - berofresources ( e . g . , medicalpersonnelandequipment , transportation , facilities , activity materials and equipment ) . Given the popularity of chronic - illness summer camps and the high cost associated with these programs , it is imperative that researchers systematically evaluate the extent to which these camps meet stated goals . Severalpreviousstudieshavedemonstratedpositiveoutcomesasso - ciated with illness - speci ﬁ c youth summer camps ; however , few studies have examined youth outcomes of a summer camp designed for youth with various chronic illnesses , and even fewer have done so in the unique medical care climate of the United States ( e . g . , Békési et al . , 2011 ; Kiernan , Gormley , & MacLachlan , 2004 ) . Camps that include a va - riety of illness populations could provide a cost - effective use of re - sources , making a comparison of outcomes for illness - speci ﬁ c and illness non - speci ﬁ c camps a particularly important endeavor ( e . g . , Békési et al . , 2011 ; Kiernan et al . , 2004 ; Woods et al . , 2013 ) . The camp in this study was comparable in duration ( Pulgaron et al . , 2010 ) , structure ( Békési et al . , 2011 ; Kiernan et al . , 2004 ; Warady et al . , 1992 ; Woods et al . , 2013 ) , activity availability ( Hunter et al . , 2006 ; Jamison et al . , 1986 ; Pulgaron et al . , 2010 ; Rimmer et al . , 2007 ; Walker & Pearman , 2009 ; Warady et al . , 1992 ; Wu et al . , 2011 ) , and extent of vol - unteer versus paid staff ( Epstein et al . , 2005 ) to numerous other pediat - ric illness camps that have been associated with campers ' improved psychosocial adjustment in previous studies . While a number of studies have demonstrated positive outcomes associated with illness - speci ﬁ c summer camps , to our knowledge , this study is one of few to evaluate child outcomes of an illness non - speci ﬁ c youth summer camp . The purpose of the current study was to examine associations be - tween opportunities for social engagement and participation in age - normative activities at camp and psychosocial factors associated with healthy adjustment . Speci ﬁ cally , we sought to determine whether youths ' hope , attitude toward illness , and perceptions of illness bene ﬁ t and burden changed after attending a summer camp in the United States for youth with a variety of chronic illnesses . This study also eval - uated whether the number of optional activities in which campers par - ticipated predicted changes in dependent variables . Summer camps for youth with chronic illness require a large number of resources ( e . g . , medical personnel and equipment , transportation , facilities , activ - ity materials and equipment ) . Given the popularity of chronic - illness summer camps and the high cost associated with these programs , it is imperative that researchers systematically evaluate the extent to whichthesecampsmeetstatedgoals . Campsthatincludeavarietyofill - nesspopulationscould provide a cost - effective use of resources , making a comparison of outcomes for illness - speci ﬁ c and illness non - speci ﬁ c camps a particularly important endeavor . A number of studies have demonstrated positive outcomes associated with illness - speci ﬁ c sum - mer camps . To our knowledge , this study is one of few to evaluate child outcomes of an illness non - speci ﬁ c youth summer camp within the United States . Contrary to expectations , our hypotheses were rejected . We found no overall changes in campers ' hope ( agency and pathways ) , attitude toward illness , or perceptions of illness bene ﬁ t or burden . This ﬁ nding is perhaps surprising given previous results that attendance at an illness - speci ﬁ c summer camp is related to positive psychosocial changes ( Meltzer & Rourke , 2005 ; Packman et al . , 2005 ; Sidhu et al . , 2006 ; Pulgaron et al . , 2010 ; Shepanski et al . , 2005 ; Woods et al . , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2011 ) . We assessed varying constructs than those measured in most previous camps and our camp differed from many of those pre - viously studied in that our camp included youth with a variety of diag - noses . Despite these differences , our camp did share common features with illness - speci ﬁ c camps . Like illness - speci ﬁ c camps , our camp was designed to improve perceptions of social support and social inclusion byofferingyouthopportunitiestointeractwithpeersduringmealtimes , cabin times , and optional activities . Also like speci ﬁ c - illness summer camps , our camp was designed to provide opportunities for campers to experience developmentally - normative autonomy from their pri - mary caregiver that may not be possible at home ( Hullmann et al . , 2010 ) . The development of autonomyfor children with a chronic illness is important but can be complicated by family factors ( Beacham & Deatrick , 2013 ) . The camp experience aims to provide opportunities for promoting autonomy . Still , our camp did differ from illness - speci ﬁ c camps in potentially important ways . The overall mission of the camp is to provide an expe - rience for children and adolescents with a range of chronic illnesses to and to foster character , connection , and coping amongthecampers . Un - like illness - speci ﬁ c summer camps , our camp may have provided campers opportunities to compare their own illness burdens with bur - den associated with other chronic illnesses . For campers who view their illness more burdensome or interfering than other illnesses , per - haps attending camp is not likely to be related to positive changes in at - titude toward illness or perceptions of illness bene ﬁ t or burden . One goal of our camp was to decrease campers ' sense of illness burden by providing campers opportunities to successfully participate in positive social experiences and developmentally - normative camp activities ; however , unlike illness - speci ﬁ c summer camps , our camp may not have provided campers with as many opportunities to socialize with youth who have shared similar illness - related experiences . Anotherpossibility for our ﬁ ndings isthatevencampers whobene ﬁ t from social experiences and camp activities while in the camp setting may continue to believe their illness is a burden at home , at school , and in other social contexts . While the current study was not intended to evaluate speci ﬁ c camp components , the group camp activities may have been an unanticipated variable that in ﬂ uenced our ﬁ ndings . For example , the addition of camp components designed to help campers recognize illness bene ﬁ ts and identify how to participate in desired ac - tivities outside of camp could improve campers ' expectations of gener - alizing camp experiences to their everyday lives . Campers may also bene ﬁ t from camp components designed to help campers recognize ill - ness bene ﬁ ts and identify ways to participate in desired activities out - side of camp . Another potential confounding variable is the role of camper ' s previous participation in this or other camps . Additional fac - tors that may have contributed to our ﬁ ndings involve practical aspects 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Low Activities High Activities Low Pre - Camp Agency High Pre - Camp Agency P o s t - C a m p A g e n c y Fig . 1 .

Faith et al . / Journal of Pediatric Nursing 44 ( 2019 ) 56 – 62 of participation in activities . For example , youth who engaged in fewer activities may have been spending more time building social relationships , which demonstrates less overall camp involvement but better exempli ﬁ es the goals of the camp . Alternatively , some campers may have engaged in a high number of camp activities with little engagement or enjoyment of these activities , demonstrat - ing seeming participation , but in a manner that is less consistent with the overall camp mission . We found that participation in camp activities positively predicted post - camp hope agency ; however , this ﬁ nding was quali ﬁ ed by our ﬁ nding that youths ' pre - camp beliefs about their ability to attain future goals ( i . e . , agency ) moderated the relation between participation in op - tional camp activities and post - camp agency . Speci ﬁ cally , for campers who began camp relatively low in agency , participation in optional camp activities negatively predicted post - camp agency . Number of camp activities did not signi ﬁ cantly predict post - camp agency for campers whobegancamp relatively high in agency . Because our sample size was small and posthoc analyses revealed ﬁ ndings that only approached statistical signi ﬁ cance , the moderating role of pre - camp hope agency beliefs should be interpreted with caution . Nevertheless , it is possible that posthoc ﬁ ndings could have reached the threshold of statistical signi ﬁ cance with a larger sample size . A possible explanation for the moderating role of pre - camp hope agency could be the role of campers ' expectations of success in how they approached camp activi - ties . According to self - veri ﬁ cation theory ( Swann , 2012 ) , individuals in - terpret ambiguous social , environmental , and task - related interactions in a manner that is consistent with their beliefs about themselves . Fol - lowing from this standpoint , it is possible that youth who lack con ﬁ - dence in their ability to succeed could garner additional opportunities to con ﬁ rm these beliefs as they participate in additional camp activities . Forcamperswhobegincamplowinagency , perceptionsofunsuccessful participation in camp activities could be especially salient because campers can observe other youth with chronic illnesses participating successfully . This study had several strengths . First , our sample was diverse in campers ' race , ethnicity , and socioeconomic status . Participant diversity increases generalizability of study ﬁ ndings . Campers also had a variety of medical diagnoses , making this study a unique contribution to litera - ture that evaluates chronic illness summer camps . This study evaluated the role of campers ' participation in optional camp activities in predicting changes in psychosocial functioning , allowing us to begin dismantling our summer camp program to determine whether optional camp activities predict additional change . Also , the camp in this study was comparable in duration ( Pulgaron et al . , 2010 ) , to numerous other pediatric illness camps that have been associated with campers ' improved psychosocial adjustment in previous studies , allowing for generalizability . As with all studies , this study also had some limitations . We did not collect follow - updata after camp , sowe cannot ascertain whether camp experiences were related to changes over time or if changes in hope persisted over time . Most of our campers had previously attended camp , so we were unable to consider prior camp attendance as a mod - erator . Further analyses can help to determine if repeat - camp atten - dance changed perceptions and responses and future studies should evaluate this variable . We also did not compare campers to a control groupofchildrenwithchronicillness , sowecannotbesurethatchanges inbeliefsarenottheresultofnormalmaturation . Internalconsistencyof the CHS subscales decreased from good to adequate from pre - to post - camp . Camp components may have targeted some components of the hope subscales more than others . Finally , we used only campers ' self - reports to assess camper changes , which limited the scope of this study to campers ' beliefs and attitudes instead of to objective , observ - able behaviors . An important next step in dismantling active components of sum - mer camps is conducting studies to determine which camp activities are most associated with psychosocial improvements . Of particular importance will be studies comparing outcomes for illness speci ﬁ c and illness non - speci ﬁ c summer camps that have identical curriculums . If the moderating role of pre - camp perceptions of hope agency is repli - cated in future studies , work is needed to improve outcomes for youth who begin camp low in hope about the future . Research is also needed to determine whether extending camp length or engaging in explicit discussions about generalizing camp skills to other contexts could im - prove campers ' perceptions of illness bene ﬁ t and burden . One reason campers ' participation in optional activities did not moderate changes in attitudes about illness could be that number of activities does not ac - count for campers ' investment in individual activities . Even campers whoparticipated in a small number of activitiesmay have chosen to en - gage in those activities for longer durations or in greater depth than campers who engaged in many optional activities during camp . Future studies should evaluate the degree to which campers ' investment in or enjoyment of camp activities predicts changes in psychosocial functioning . Future studies should also systematically evaluate whether speci ﬁ c components of camp ( e . g . , sharing cabins with other campers ) or improved perceptions of social support , task mastery , and perceptions of autonomy mediate changes in psycho - social functioning . To that end , youth in our study were placed in camp cabins based on age and irrespective of camper diagnosis . Fu - ture studies should evaluate whether placing youth in cabins with campers who have similar diagnoses is related to more positive so - cial experiences or a greater sense of mastery over camp activities . Finally , future studies should compare outcomes for youth who at - tend illness non - speci ﬁ c camps to youth who attend illness - speci ﬁ c camps or no camp at all . This study provides an important increment to extant literature by systematically evaluating a summer camp designed for youth with chronic illnesses . Our ﬁ ndings contrast previous ﬁ ndings and suggest future research is needed to determine whether youth can bene ﬁ t from attending non - speci ﬁ c illness camps and to identify camp components that are necessary to effect change . Given restricted ﬁ scal resources , time , and volunteer commitments , many agencies may ﬁ nd implementing a single summer camp for youth with a variety of illnesses more feasible than administrating separate camps for different disease populations . However , non - speci ﬁ c illness camps must be predicated on an understanding of program ef ﬁ cacy and speci ﬁ c mechanisms of change . Further studies are needed to continue evaluating whether summer camps for youth with a variety of illnesses meet their stated goals . Practice Implications Our study provides implications for possible outcomes associated with attendance at a summer camp designed for youth with chronic ill - ness . Findings indicate a contrast from previous research of summer camps designed for youth with other chronic illnesses suggesting that attendinganillness - speci ﬁ csummercamp is relatedto positivepsycho - social changes ( Meltzer & Rourke , 2005 ; Packman et al . , 2005 ; Sidhu et al . , 2006 ; Pulgaron et al . , 2010 ; Shepanski et al . , 2005 ; Woods et al . , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2011 ) . The results of this study found no overall changes in campers ' hope , attitude toward illness , or perceptions of ill - ness bene ﬁ t or burden . Future investigations are warranted to deter - mine whether youth can bene ﬁ t from attending non - speci ﬁ c illness camps and to identify camp components that are necessary to effect change .
