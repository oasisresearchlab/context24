The transmissibility of novel Coronavirus in the early stages of the 2019 - 20 outbreak in Wuhan : Exploring initial point - source exposure sizes and durations using scenario analysis [ version 1 ; peer review : Wellcome Open Research 2020 , : 17 ( ) awaiting peer review ] 5 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 12688 / wellcomeopenres . 15718 . 1 03 Feb 2020 , : 17 ( ) First published : 5 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 12688 / wellcomeopenres . 15718 . 1 Page 2 of 8 Wellcome Open Research 2020 , 5 : 17 Last updated : 03 FEB 2020 Introduction The ongoing outbreak of novel Coronavirus appears to have originated from an initial point - source exposure event at Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan , China , which was closed on the 31st of December 2019 1 , 2 . As of the 26th of January 2020 there have been over 2000 confirmed cases with the majority in China 3 . Globally , countries are on high alert , with wide imple - mentation of airport checks and contact tracing find and quar - antine infected individuals . In China , officials have restricted travel across a wide area . There is still uncertainty around the precise scale and duration of the initial exposure event 4 . The nature of the initial exposure has implications for estimates of the transmissibility of the coronavirus , as such it is important that these potential scenarios are further explored . We used a stochastic branching process model to simulate the Wuhan outbreak , parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by outbreaks of other coro - naviruses , such as the 2002 – 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) and multiple outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) . We considered a realistic range of parameters where data were not available , quantifying how likely these sce - narios were to occur using reported cases . We focused on the size and duration of the initial exposure event in particular , and the impact that this has on the estimated level of human - to - human transmission . We aimed to provide decision makers , and research - ers , with probability estimates for each scenario considered , along with estimates of the reproduction number ( R0 ) across all scenarios . Methods Branching process model We modelled the outbreak using a stochastic branching proc - ess model comparable to those used elsewhere to model the dynamics of this outbreak 4 . We assumed that cases from the initial transmission event were uniformly distributed over the duration of the event . Each case then resulted in a subsequent generation of cases with the number of cases that each case generated being drawn from a negative binomial distribution , to account for overdispersion , with a dispersion parameter k of 0 . 16 ( assuming SARS - like dispersion ) 5 . The mean number of cases generated by each case ( R0 ) was sampled from a uni - form distribution once per model simulation with a lower and upper bound determined by the scenario being evaluated . New generations of cases were then sampled iteratively until the maximum simulation time was reached . We used three sce - narios for the serial interval distribution informed by previous outbreaks of coronaviruses : SARS - like , with a mean of 8 . 4 days and standard deviation of 3 . 8 days 5 ; SARS - like before interven - tions , with a mean of 10 days and standard deviation of 2 . 8 days ; and MERS - like , with a mean of 6 . 8 days and standard deviation of 4 . 1 days 6 . Both SARS - like serial interval scenarios used a Weibull distribution , whilst the MERS - like serial interval sce - nario used a Gamma distribution 5 , 6 . After the simulation of the branching process , reporting delays were added as reported in a line - list of cases compiled from media and other reports 7 . We fitted a geometric , Poisson , and a negative binomial distribution to these observed delays and selected the best fit using the Chi - squared statistic . If no good fit was determined using a p - value threshold of 0 . 05 , then the reporting delay was instead sampled from the empirical delays in the line - list . Scenario analysis We simulated the branching process model 10 , 000 times for all combinations of the following parameters : number of con - firmed cases resulting from the initial exposure ( 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 200 , 400 ) , initial exposure event duration ( 1 day , 7 days , 14 days , 21 days , and 28 days ) , the serial interval distribution ( SARS - like , initial SARS - like and MERS - like ) , and R0 ( lower and upper bounds of a uniform distribution : 0 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 2 - 3 , 3 - 4 ) . We ran the model from the beginning of the outbreak for each scenario until the 25th of January 2020 . The start date was determined by combining the duration of the transmis - sion event with the date the fish market in Wuhan , the source of the outbreak , closed ( 31st of December 2019 ) . We evaluated the samples from each scenario based on how closely their trajectories matched the 1 , 975 confirmed cases observed on the 25th of January 7 . Samples were rejected if their simu - lated cumulative case estimates were outside a 5 % interval on either side of this ( 1 , 876 - 2 , 074 ) . Outbreak simulation was stopped if a sample exceeded the upper bound on the number of observed cases . Analysis We visually compared the percentage of samples that were accepted for each combination of transmission event size , trans - mission event duration , mean serial interval , and R0 using a heat map . We then compared the distribution of R0 for accepted samples by transmission event size , transmission event duration and mean serial interval . We reported 90 % credible intervals ( CrI ) for R0 , stratified by the transmission event size , transmission event duration and the assumed mean serial interval . Implementation All analysis was carried out using R version 3 . 6 . 2 8 . The branch - ing process model was implemented using the bpmodels 0 . 1 . 0 package 9 . The analysis is available as an open - source R package 10 . A dockerfile has been made available with the code to ensure reproducibility 11 . Results Percentage of outbreak simulations accepted Overall , the highest acceptance rate was for scenarios with a large event size ( 200 ) , short duration ( 1 day ) , an R0 between 3 and 4 , and a pre - intervention SARS - like serial interval ( Figure 1 ) . Scenarios with a SARS - like serial interval , an R0 bounded between 2 and 3 , a short duration , and a relatively large event size ( 100 ) also had a high acceptance rate . Across all sce - narios a higher acceptance rate was correlated with a larger event size , a shorter event duration , and a larger mean serial interval . This may be related to the influence these parameters have on the degree of volatility in outbreak simulations . Based on this , trends in Figure 1 should be interpreted with care using prior knowledge . For example , if the event size , serial Page 3 of 8 Wellcome Open Research 2020 , 5 : 17 Last updated : 03 FEB 2020 Figure 1 . Heatmaps of the percentage of samples accepted for each combination of parameters . Within each heatmap , the x - axis represents the duration of the initial seeding event and the y - axis represents the size of the initial seeding event . The figure is stratified by the R0 scenario ( columns ) and the serial interval distribution ( rows ) . interval , and event duration is assumed , then the percentage of acceptance may be used to infer the most likely R0 scenario . There were very few scenarios where an R0 smaller than 1 resulted in scenarios that were accepted after conditioning on observed data , this was true regardless of the corresponding serial interval distribution , event size , or event duration . A very large event size ( 400 ) was required for scenarios with an R0 upper bound of 2 to have a moderate percentage of samples accepted if they had a short duration . Acceptance rates increased as the duration of the initial transmission event increased , and as the mean serial interval increased . For a MERS - like serial interval , the percentage of accepted samples was low for all scenarios , with the highest accepted proportion for scenarios Page 4 of 8 Wellcome Open Research 2020 , 5 : 17 Last updated : 03 FEB 2020 with an upper bound on the R0 of 3 and a moderate event size , or an R0 upper bound of 2 and a larger event size . Estimated reproduction numbers Uncertainty in the R0 estimate increased both as the event size decreased , and decreased as the mean serial interval increased ( Figure 2 ) . Large event sizes resulted in the lowest R0 estimates across all scenarios evaluated . The estimated R0 decreased as the event size decreased and duration increased for all serial interval scenarios ( Table 1 , Table 2 , and Table 3 ) . The most likely scenario with a MERS - like serial interval had an event size of 80 and a duration of a day , resulting in an esti - mated R0 between 2 – 3 ( 90 % CrI , Table 1 ) . For the SARS - like interval the most likely scenario had an event size of 200 and a duration of a day ( Figure 1 ) , this resulted in an estimated R0 between 2 – 2 . 7 ( 90 % CrI , Table 2 ) .

Assuming a MERS - like serial interval resulted in an approximate decrease of 0 - 0 . 5 in the R0 estimates across all scenarios when compared to the SARS - like serial interval . Assuming a pre - intervention SARS - like serial interval resulted in an approximate increase of 0 . 5 - 1 in the R0 estimates across all scenarios when com - pared to the SARS - like serial interval . Across all serial interval scenarios R0 estimates were comparable when event size was decreased and event duration was increased in tandem . Discussion In this study , we explored a range of scenarios for the initial event size and duration of the exposure event which initiated the 2019 – 20 Wuhan novel coronavirus outbreak . We conditioned on observed cases to establish the probability of each scenario , given our model , and then estimated the R0 of coronavirus from the accepted simulations . We found that there was a very low probability that the reproduction numbers was less than 1 for any scenario considered . Across all serial interval scenarios larger exposure events over a shorter time horizon were most plausible . The most probable SARS - like serial interval sce - narios resulted in an estimated R0 of 2 - 2 . 7 ( 90 % CrI ) , whilst the most probable pre - intervention SARS - like serial interval scenarios resulted in an estimated R0 of 2 . 8 - 3 . 8 ( 90 % CrI ) . MERS - like serial interval scenarios were less plausible , but the most plausible resulted in an estimate R0 of 2 - 3 ( 90 % CrI ) . Reducing the event size led to estimates of the R0 increas - ing but also reduced the proportion of samples accepted . Simi - larly , increasing the event duration reduced the estimated R0 whilst decreasing the proportion of accepted samples . Decreas - ing the event size whilst increasing the duration resulted in R0 estimates that were comparable to those from the most plausible scenarios and reduced the acceptance rate the least . Our study used a stochastic model to capture the transmis - sion dynamics of the outbreak with parameters informed from data were possible , if there was no data available then parameters were assumed to be similar to those estimated for SARS 5 . We only fitted to the cumulative data at one time point , on 25 January 2020 , as time - resolved data of onsets was not available at this point in time . It has also been reported that it is likely that the efforts to confirm suspected cases have changed over time , which also precludes fitting to earlier data points . As the outbreak progresses time - resolved data of reported cases or disease onsets are likely to become available , with suffi - ciently consistent data reporting it is likely that other approaches will become superior to the one presented here . More data on the serial interval distribution , on variability of transmission and possible superspreading events , as well as on the timing and impact of interventions , is likely to become available dur - ing the course of the outbreak . This will make it possible to estimate the R0 with greater precision with less risk of bias due to unknown parameters . The number of scenarios that need to be evaluated may also be reduced as additional informa - tion about cases connected to the initial exposure event becomes available . Though our estimates had wide credible intervals it is possible that we could not fully account for the numerous sources of bias and uncertainty present in the available data . This means that our model estimates may be both spuriously precise and potentially biased . There is some evidence of this in our results as the scenarios with the highest acceptance rate were on the edge of our scenario grid both for event size , event dura - tion , and mean serial interval . This may be the result of these scenarios reducing volatility and therefore having narrower distributions of estimated cases . Indeed , we found that R0 esti - mates were comparable as event size decreased and event duration increased . Expert knowledge relating to the size and duration of the initial event may help clarify this issue . Alternatively , other estimates of R0 may be used to indicate which event size and event duration scenarios are most plausible . A previous study also looked at varying the event size and the impact that this had on R0 estimates using a branch - ing process 4 . Our work builds on this by also looking at event duration , including reporting delays , and using a different approach to condition on observed cases . For comparable scenarios , our results were similar to those previously published but we found that R0 estimates were highly sensitive to varia - tion in the assumed serial interval , event size , and event duration . We made use of a highly reproducible framework ( an R pack - age ) and have released all of our code as open - source 10 . This means that this analysis may be repeated - both by the authors and others - as more data becomes available . In addition , subject area experts may be able to adapt our analysis using this open - source code to reduce the potential for bias using their expert knowledge or privately held data . The R package we have developed alongside our analysis may be generalisable to other point source outbreaks when time series data on cases is unavailable or difficult to verify . Additional work is needed to ensure the robustness of this tool but this may allow this analysis to be repeated during future outbreaks with little additional overhead . This analysis used a stochastic branching process to explore sce - narios around the duration and size of the initial exposure event at the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan . Despite the scarcity of data currently available our estimates may be used to rule out some scenarios and to assess the likelihood of others . Our results indicate that it is very unlikely that the infec - tious agent responsible for the Wuhan outbreak has a R0 of less than 1 , unless the size of the transmission event was much greater than currently reported . We also found that a large ini - tial exposure event was likely , combined with a short duration . These scenarios resulted in R0 estimates that are comparable to those estimated during the 2002 – 2003 SARS outbreak . However , with the available data we could not identify whether scenarios with a SARS - like or pre - intervention SARS - like serial inter - val were more likely . As more information becomes available it may be possible to further refine our results and establish the value of R0 . Providing clear quantitative information for deci - sion makers on the transmissibility of coronavirus is of clear public health importance . Our work to make this process Page 7 of 8 Wellcome Open Research 2020 , 5 : 17 Last updated : 03 FEB 2020 reproducible may reduce the time these estimates take to be made available in future outbreaks and increase knowledge sharing across response teams .
