Although the molecular properties of 28 myosin II are well known , there is still debate about the collective work of the motors : is there 29 cooperativity between myosin motors while binding to the actin filaments ? In this study , we 30 used high - speed AFM to evaluate this issue . We observed that the initial binding of small 31 arrays of myosin heads to the non - regulated actin filaments did not affect the cooperative 32 probability of subsequent bindings to neighboring sites and did not lead to an increase in the 33 fractional occupancy of the actin binding sites . These results suggest that myosin motors are 34 independent force generators when connected in small arrays , and that the binding of one 35 myosin does not alter the kinetics of other myosins . In contrast , the probability of binding of 36 myosin heads to regulated thin filaments under activating conditions ( at high Ca 2 + 37 concentration and with 2 μM ATP ) was increased with the initial binding of one myosin , 38 leading to a larger occupancy of neighboring available binding sites . The result suggests that 39 myosin cooperativity is defined by the activation status of the thin filaments . 40 41 3 eLife digest 42 43 Muscle contraction is the result of large ensembles of the molecular motor myosin II working 44 in coordination while attached to actin . Myosin II produces the power stroke , responsible for 45 force generation . In this paper , we used High - Speed Atomic Force Microscopy ( HS - AFM ) to 46 determine the potential cooperativity between myosin motors bound to non - regulated and 47 regulated thin filaments . Based on the direct visualization of myosin - actin interaction , 48 probability of myosin binding , and the myosin fractional occupancy of binding sites along non - 49 regulated and regulated actin filaments , our results show no cooperative effects over ~ 100 50 nm of the actin filament length . In contrast , there is myosin cooperativity within the activated 51 thin filament , that induces a high affinity of myosin heads to the filaments . Our results support 52 the independent behaviour of myosin heads while attached to actin filaments , but a 53 cooperative behavior when attached to regulated thin filaments . 54 55 56 4 Introduction 57 Myosin II is a non - processive molecular motor that binds to actin filaments to produce 58 mechanical work , using the chemical free energy of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . After an 59 initial attachment to actin , the myosin motor domain undergoes conformational changes 60 associated with release of the ATP hydrolysis products inorganic phosphate ( P i ) and ADP 61 from the active site of myosin . In this process , a force - generating power stroke , with swing of 62 the myosin lever arm , is generated and there is a transition of myosin from the weak to the 63 strong actin - binding states ( Rayment et al . , 1993 ; Fisher et al . , 1995 ; Mansson et al . , 2018 ; 64 Robert - Paganin et al . , 2020 ) . 65 66 Myosin II molecules form bipolar filaments in skeletal , cardiac and smooth muscles and this 67 filamentous form of myosin II allows the motors to collectively produce high forces during 68 muscle contraction despite a low duty ratio ( Finer et al . , 1994 ; Ishijima et al . , 1994 ; Yanagida 69 & Ishijima , 1995 ; Kaya & Higuchi , 2010 ; Kaya et al . , 2017 ; Pertici et al . , 2018 ; Cheng et al . , 70 2019 ; Cheng et al . , 2020 ) . The actin - attached fraction of the ATP turnover time , the duty 71 ratio , is ~ 5 % ( Howard , 1997 ) , which enables high speeds of shortening ( Pertici et al . , 2018 ; 72 Cheng et al . , 2020 ) . Although most studies looking to the mechanics of isolated myosin II 73 have been performed with single molecules , assemblies of myosin II have been investigated 74 in arrays developed with a small number of motors adsorbed to silica beads ( Debold et al . , 75 2005 ) , optical fiber surfaces ( Pertici et al . , 2018 ) or with the native thick filaments ( Cheng et 76 al . , 2020 ) . These small ensemble studies show a load dependence and force - velocity relation 77 that is similar to that observed in myofibrillar ( Lowey et al . , 2018 ) and cellular preparations 78 ( Edman & Hwang , 1977 ) . Furthermore , these force - velocity relationships can be modelled 79 using single molecule properties ( Mansson et al . , 2018 ; Mansson , 2019 ) , and experimental 80 5 data from single molecules ( Kaya & Higuchi , 2010 ; Capitanio et al . , 2012 ; Sung et al . , 2015 ) 81 suggesting that myosin II motors are independent force generators , as postulated decades 82 ago ( Huxley , 1957 ) , even when they are attached to a common thick filament . 83 84 However , there are also suggestions that myosin molecules work cooperatively , and the work 85 produced by motor assemblies is different from individual motors ( Kaya et al . , 2017 ) . 86 Accordingly , the attachment of one motor would interfere with the kinetics and attachment 87 mechanics of other motors when working in arrays . The result casts doubt on the concept of 88 independent force generators in motor assemblies . Cooperativity could also arise in double - 89 headed molecules ( Huxley & Tideswell , 1997 ; Brunello et al . , 2007 ) or myosin motors that 90 bind to adjacent actin sites ( Caremani et al . , 2013 ; Rahman et al . , 2018 ) . X - ray diffraction 91 studies using muscle fibre preparations provide evidence that the coordinated movements of 92 myosin heads may indeed regulate force generation ( Irving et al . , 1992 ; Linari et al . , 2015 ) . 93 Finally , this form of cooperativity may arise from allosteric changes of the actin filament itself 94 so that binding of one myosin molecule modifies the kinetics of myosin binding to nearby 95 sites ( Orlova et al . , 1993 ; Tokuraku et al . , 2009 ; Prochniewicz et al . , 2010 ) . 96 97 Other forms of cooperativity between myosin motors involve activation of the thin filament 98 where several cooperative phenomena have been described ( Gordon et al . , 2000 ) . In skeletal 99 muscle sarcomeres , actin – myosin interactions are regulated by Ca 2 + through the regulatory 100 proteins troponin ( Tn ) and tropomyosin ( Tm ) , that form the thin filament complex with actin . 101 Each of the Tm molecules contact seven actin monomers and is associated with the three Tn 102 subunits : Tn - T , Tn - I and Tn - C . Upon Ca 2 + binding to Tn - C , conformational changes are 103 triggered in the Tn – Tm complex resulting in a displacement of Tm that allows for myosin 104 6 binding to actin ( Galinska - Rakoczy et al . , 2008 ; Lehman et al . , 2009 ) . We previously have 105 shown that under relaxing conditions , thin filaments presented a combination of activated and 106 non - activated segments along their lengths , and were not blocked from myosin ; the 107 equilibrium between blocked and closed states was defined by Ca 2 + - induced Tn - Tm 108 conformational changes ( Matusovsky et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , myosin binding to actin is also 109 required for full activation , or to induce the open state of activation of the thin filament 110 ( McKillop and Geeves , 1993 ; Smith & Geeves , 2003 ; Desai et al . , 2015 ) . When myosin binds 111 to actin , it may directly affect the regulatory system by changing the conformation of Tm , such 112 that other myosin heads can attach to thin filaments ( Geeves & Holmes ; 1999 ; Gordon et al . , 113 2000 ) . Furthermore , the question remains if one or two myosin heads in a molecule are 114 required for the full activation of the thin filament . 115 116 Therefore , cooperativity during myosin II - actin interactions can conceptually arise from at 117 least two sources : cooperativity among myosin molecules within the thick filaments due to 118 structural changes in the actin filament or cooperativity through activation of the regulated , 119 thin filaments . Each cooperativity source may present different mechanisms . In this study , we 120 used High - Speed Atomic Force Microscopy ( HS - AFM ) to evaluate the potential cooperativity 121 of double - headed heavy meromyosin fragments ( HMM ) of myosin II that were connected 122 through the S2 tail regions , while attaching between non - regulated actin filaments , or 123 regulated thin filaments . Because HS - AFM allows the investigation of protein dynamics with 124 nanometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolutions ( Kodera et al . , 2021 ; Heath & 125 Scheuring , 2018 ; Matusovsky et al . , 2021 ) our experimental approach allows us to 126 investigate important aspects of myosin cooperativity , with a better resolution than previous 127 fluorescence microscopy studies ( spatial resolution limitation of > 100 nm ) ( Desai et al . , 128 7 2015 ) . Specifically for this study , we developed a method in which HMM motors , attached by 129 their S2 regions to form a structure with up to 8 - 10 individual myosin heads ( 4 - 5 HMM 130 molecules ) bound to nearby sites along two actin filaments or two thin filaments ( Fig . 1 and 131 Fig . S1 ) . The benefit of this approach is the ability to monitor the behavior of each of the 132 HMM heads over the time of an experiment to evaluate the potential cooperative binding of 133 HMM heads with either actin or thin filaments during the ATPase cycle . The approach also 134 allows investigation of aspects of inter - head cooperativity as well as the potential to 135 investigate cooperative changes along actin or thin filaments at spatial resolution similar to 136 the inter - monomer distance along the filaments . 137 138 Results 139 Experimental design to study myosin cooperativity by HS - AFM 140 In order to track the cooperativity behavior of the myosin heads within a sequence of 141 successive HS - AFM images , we used an experimental approach in which pairs of HMM 142 heads are attached to two actin filaments ( Fig . 1 , Fig . S1 ) , as explained in details in a 143 previous study from our laboratory ( Matusovsky et al . , 2021 ) . Briefly , we aimed for an 144 experimental situation in which two non - regulated actin filaments ( F - actin ) or two regulated 145 cardiac thin filaments ( cTFs ) were bound to an underlying mica - supported lipid bilayer ( SLB ) 146 surface , in parallel to each other , and with enough space for binding of double - headed HMM 147 molecules between them . A cross - section analysis showed that the distance between two 148 actin filaments during the experiments was 40 . 56 ± 9 . 65 nm , and the distance between cTFs 149 was 67 . 69 ± 15 . 92 nm ( Fig . S2 ) . The observed difference in distance ( 27 . 1 ± 6 . 1 nm ) between 150 non - regulated F - actin and regulated cTFs did not affect the HMM binding and displacement 151 analysis ( Figs 1f , 2c ) . 152 8 153 Once the filaments were found in a parallel orientation , HMM fragments were added into the 154 HS - AFM chamber filled with an experimental solution or placed on the top of the mica - SLB 155 surface , in a solution containing 0 . 2 - 10 μM of NPE - caged or non - caged ATP . We then 156 searched for events where each of the two HMM heads would interact with two parallel 157 filaments . Immediately after both HMM heads were bound between parallel actin filaments , 158 we activated the NPE - caged ATP in the solution by photolysis using a UV laser ( 340 nm ) 159 installed into the HS - AFM system ( see Materials and Methods ) . The HS - AFM snapshots of 160 two parallel non - regulated F - actins or regulated cTFs showed regularly bound HMM 161 molecules between them in the absence or in the presence of ATP ( Figs S1 , S2 ) . The 162 globular upper and lower heads of each HMM molecule were bound in ~ 30 - 37 nm proximity 163 from each other , along the actin half - helical pitch structure ( Fig . 1 , Fig . S2 ) . HMM heads were 164 not bound to all the available actin - binding sites along the filaments at various experimental 165 conditions , including rigor or in the presence of ADP in similarity to electron microscopy 166 studies ( Orlova et al . , 1993 ) . This observation may be related to the immobilization of S2 167 regions of each HMM molecule to the underlying lipid bilayer , allowing it to reach a maximum 168 of ~ 2 - 3 binding spots between neighboring actin monomers , i . e . , 11 nm or 2 × 5 . 5 nm 169 ( Fig . 1b ) . The ~ 37 nm arrangement of myosin heads in our HS - AFM experiments is similar to 170 the preferable binding sites of myosin heads along actin filaments ( Steffen et al . , 2001 ) and 171 relate to the ~ 37 nm hotspots for myosin head bindings along the thin filaments in the A - band 172 of the sarcomere ( Wang et al . , 2021 ) . 173 174 9 175 Figure 1 .

Related to Movies S1 - S3 . 194 195 196 Kinetics of actin - myosin interaction in the non - regulated and regulated systems 197 We characterized functional parameters of the myosin heads bound between two parallel 198 non - regulated F - actins or regulated cTFs , including the average backward and forward 199 10 displacements ( d ) of myosin heads in the presence of ATP ( and high Ca 2 + = pCa 4 . 5 in the 200 case of cTFs ) . The HMM displacements calculated as a change in the center of mass ( COM ) 201 of the myosin head at the given time during the experiment ( Fig . 1c , see also Materials and 202 Methods ) were in the range of 6 - 8 nm . The backward ( towards minus end of the filament ) and 203 forward ( towards plus end of the filament ) HMM displacements were calculated . The size 204 distribution of HMM displacements revealed two distinct peaks in F - actin - HMM and cTFs - 205 HMM complexes that most likely represent the events occurring through ADP ( 1 - 3 nm 206 displacements ) and P i releases ( over 3 nm displacements as previously described 207 ( Matusovsky et al . , 2021 ) . The sum of two peaks for backwards and forward displacements of 208 HMM molecules were 5 . 5 ± 1 . 68 nm and 7 . 8 ± 1 . 96 nm on the non - regulated actin filaments , 209 and 7 . 4 ± 1 . 73 nm and 7 . 6 ± 1 . 95 nm on the regulated cTFs ( Figs . 1f and 2c ) . 210 211 The evaluation of displacement and working stroke of myosin heads in the HS - AFM was 212 described in details in the Materials and Methods . Briefly , the working stroke is viewed as a 213 transition from the weak to the strong - binding states evaluated by the changes in the lever 214 arm movement . The change in the lever arm considers a defined polarity of the actin filament . 215 In the presence of Mg . ATP , myosin heads detach from the filament and re - attach to the same 216 or a new binding site , allowing us to determine the displacement of the myosin head by the 217 change in COM . The calculated displacement in our study is slightly larger than the working 218 stroke size of 5 nm reported for S1 ( Capitanio et al . , 2006 ) and slightly smaller than the 219 values obtained from structural studies with single - headed myosin ( ~ 10 - 12 nm ) ( Geeves et 220 al . , 2005 ) . It is comparable with studies performed with myosin molecules evaluated with 221 laser tweezers ( Finer et al . , 1994 ; Tyska et al . , 1999 ) and single fiber mechanics ( Piazzesi et 222 al . , 2002 ) . 223 11 224 The representative binomial binding traces of the individual upper and lower myosin heads in 225 the F - actin - HMM ( Fig . 1d , Movies S1 - S3 ) and in the cTFs - HMM ( Fig . 2a , Movie S4 ) revealed 226 that binding of one HMM head is not necessarily accompanied by the binding of the second 227 HMM head for the given HMM molecule ( M1 - M4 , Figs 1d and 2a ) . To specifically investigate 228 the coordination between two heads in a molecule we analyzed the binding events at the 229 different ATP concentrations . Tellingly , the binding events of two heads of given HMM 230 molecule bound between two filaments was higher at lower ATP concentrations . At the higher 231 ATP concentrations , the binding of either one head or two heads was approximately equally 232 distributed ( Fig . S3 ) . 233 234 235 12 Figure 2 . The kinetics of double - headed myosin motors bound to regulated cTFs . ( a - b ) 236 Representative time course of binomial binding ( a ) and heads displacements ( b ) calculated for the 237 individual HMM molecules ( M1 - M4 ) at the given time for upper and lower heads of each HMM 238 molecule in the presence of 0 . 5 μ M ATP and high Ca 2 + concentrations . ( c ) The backward and forward 239 myosin displacements in the cTFs - HMM complex ( n = 5 , 911 events , ~ 35 HMM molecules ) ; data sets 240 were fitted by sum of two Gaussians ( r 2 = 0 . 99 and r 2 = 0 . 99 , respectively ) . 241 242 243 Probability of HMM binding to the non - regulated and regulated actin filaments 244 To monitor the probability of binding events between individual myosin heads we applied a 245 probability analysis based on a binary combination : HMM bound to the filaments equals to “1” 246 and HMM detached from the filaments equals to “0” . To use this analysis , we need to 247 evaluate if there is any directional bias in the myosin bindings along the F - actin and cTFs , 248 either towards the barbed plus end or the pointed minus end of the filaments . Therefore , the 249 polarity of F - actin and cTFs complexed with HMM was determined by using the morphology 250 of the myosin heads bound to the filaments ( Ngo et al . , 2015 ) . The bound myosin heads 251 observed in the presence of Mg . ATP , Mg . ADP or in the rigor state allowed us to determine 252 the polarity of the filaments ( see Figs S1 , S2 - S5 ) . According to our observations the most 253 frequent myosin head orientation in the weak binding state ( presence of Mg . ATP - γ - S ) or 254 strong binding state ( rigor state ) is the one where the heads of HMM molecules are 255 positioned toward the minus end of the filament ( Fig . 1h , Fig . 3a - b , Fig . 4b - d , Fig . S5 ) . 256 Therefore , binding events that occurred towards to the plus end of the filament ( M n  M n + 1 ) 257 for individual upper and lower myosin heads at ATP concentrations ranging from 0 . 2 - 10 μM 258 were used in the analysis . 259 260 Initially , we tested binding of HMM between two filaments in rigor conditions , i . e . , in the 261 absence of ATP and Ca 2 + , or in the presence of ATP - γ - S , a slowly hydrolyzed analog of ATP 262 ( Fig . S5 ) . At these conditions the HMM heads were tightly bound between two filaments with 263 13 high fractional occupancies : ~ 95 % for the non - regulated F - actin and ~ 79 % for the native 264 cTFs . The latter observation is consistent with the idea that the binding sites on cTFs in the 265 absence of Ca 2 + and ATP are present in an equilibrium between the blocked , closed and 266 open states ( Movie S4 ) ( Matusovsky et al . , 2019 ; Risi et al . , 2017 ; Risi et al . , 2021 ) . 267 268 269 Figure 3 .

The average fractional 276 occupancies by HMM heads for all of the sites for each of the ATP conditions showed a decrease in 277 the occupancy with time ( right panels in c - e , n = 4 ) . ( f ) Frequency distributions for the number of 278 myosin heads attached to 4 neighboring binding sites along a given actin filament or thin filament over 279 time ( n = 8 experiments , ~ 35 HMM molecules , 898 events ) . Mean number ( ± 95 % CI ) of attached 280 myosin heads relative to the 4 available binding sites given in the inset text . Full lines and dashed 281 lines in the right panels in ( c - f ) represent the regression lines and 95 % confidence intervals , 282 suggesting a decline in the number of myosin molecules in time . 283 284 285 14 The probability analyses revealed that binding of M n myosin head to the non - regulated actin 286 filaments did not affect the subsequent bindings of the next M n + 1 molecule ( towards the plus 287 end of the filament ) in the presence of different ATP concentrations ( Fig . 3 , Movies S1 - S3 ) . 288 While we can observe some random increase in the binding probabilities with 0 . 2 μM ATP or 289 2 μM ATP concentrations ( Fig . 3c - d ) towards the plus end of the filament , the average 290 fractional occupancy indicates a constant decrease in the occupancy of the binding sites with 291 time , in all ATP concentrations used in this study ( Fig . 3c - e , right panels ) . These data are 292 consistent with the results pooled from 8 different experiments , suggesting that in the F - actin - 293 HMM complex the most frequently observed events represent occupation of one binding site 294 or no binding with the average number of occupied sites calculated as 1 . 27 ± 0 . 07 ( Fig . 3f ) . 295 These results suggest that HMM molecules are frequently detached from actin in the 296 presence of ATP due to a lower affinity of myosin to actin in comparison to the affinity to the 297 thin filaments ( Fig . S4 ) . This idea is consistent with the different time evolutions of the 298 number of HMM molecules with actin and thin filaments ( Figs . 3f and 4h ) in the presence of 299 ATP . It is also consistent with findings that the fractional occupancy of actin - binding sites in 300 the absence of ATP ( rigor ) or presence of slowly hydrolyzed ATP - γ - S did not change with 301 time ( Fig . S5 ) when HMM is bound to both actin and the thin filaments all the time , 302 suggesting that the myosin heads did not detach from the filaments over the time of the 303 experiment due to interaction with the scanning cantilever tip . 304 305 At the non - activating conditions with thin filaments in the blocked state ( 0 . 5 µM ATP , pCa 306 9 . 0 ) , myosin heads revealed a similar decrease in the binding probability and fractional 307 occupancy ( Fig . 4e ) compared to the bare F - actin - HMM complex . In contrast , the probability 308 of myosin heads binding to cTFs in the closed state under activating conditions ( 0 . 5 µM ATP , 309 15 pCa 4 . 5 ) was increased ( Fig . 4f - g , Movie S4 ) compared to myosin heads binding to actin 310 filaments ( Fig . 3c - d ) . This feature is reflected in the increased average number of attached 311 myosin heads in the cTFs - HMM complex under activating conditions , almost doubling the 312 average number of bound heads ( Fig . 4h ) compared to the situation with the F - actin - HMM 313 complex ( Fig . 3f ) . The increase in probability of binding of the myosin heads to the cTFs is 314 also matched in the kymograph images of cTFs - HMM complex at the high [ Ca 2 + ] and different 315 ATP concentrations , when compared to the kymograph images obtained from F - actin - HMM 316 complex at the various ATP concentrations ( Fig . S4 ) . The random presence of activated and 317 non - activated sites across cTFs at the relaxing ( pCa > 8 ) or activating ( pCa 4 . 0 - 4 . 5 ) 318 conditions ( Risi et al . , 2017 ; Matusovsky et al . , 2019 ) complicated the analysis and can 319 explain the pattern of varied mean probabilities between HMM molecules ( Fig . 4f - g ) . 320 321 322 16 Figure 4 .

Full lines and 335 dashed lines in the right panels in ( e - h ) represent regression lines and 95 % confidence intervals . The 336 analysis suggested a decline in the number of myosin molecules with time , but to a lower degree 337 compared to the F - actin - HMM complex .

( 𝑛−𝑘 ) ! ( see Supplementary Table 1 ) . 349 350 Following this analysis , we found no change in the probability of cooperative binding of the 351 HMM heads to the non - regulated actin filaments . It suggests that the interaction in the F - 352 actin - HMM complex is largely random . The linear regression slope of the cooperative 353 probability binding between neighboring myosin heads in the F - actin - HMM complex showed 354 no significant deviation from zero ( p = 0 . 295 ) with the Pearson’s r = 0 . 766 and r 2 = 0 . 59 . In 355 contrast , the linear regression slope of the cooperative probability binding between 356 17 neighboring myosin heads in the cTFs - HMM complex showed significant deviation from zero 357 ( p = 0 . 022 ) with the Pearson’s r = 0 . 953 and r 2 = 0 . 91 ( Fig . 4i ) . In accordance with these 358 results , the individual fitting for each experiment demonstrated an increase in the cooperative 359 probability of binding of the HMM heads to the regulated cTFs in comparison to that of in F - 360 actin - HMM complex ( Figs S6 and S7 ) . This is broadly consistent with cooperativity , although 361 the degree of cooperative binding in the cTFs - HMM was variable between experiments as 362 can be noticed from confidence intervals ( Fig . 4i ) . 363 364 365 Discussion 366 In this study , we used a binomial probability analysis to evaluate the potential cooperativity 367 between myosin motors while attached to actin or regulated thin filaments . Our experimental 368 approach – using myosin motors that can attach between two filaments positioned in parallel 369 on the surface - is particularly well - suited for this analysis , and we could visualize several 370 different motors at the same time . Despite this approach has geometrical features that are 371 distinct from those of the actin - myosin arrays operating within a muscle sarcomere , it has 372 been recently shown that each of the double myosin heads can acquire different lever arm 373 confirmations and bound two different thin filaments in rigor ( Wang et al . , 2021 ) . This is also 374 true when myosin attaches to actin and thin filaments in the presence of ATP , when each 375 head may be in a different state , at a given time of the ATPase cycle ( Matusovsky et al . , 376 2021 ) . This feature may enable myosin double heads to interact with two different thin 377 filaments within the sarcomere , potentially maximizing muscle power and efficiency . Of 378 particular interest , is the fact that myosin motors can be assumed as the independent force 379 generators even when connected in small assemblies . 380 18 The displacements produced by each individual myosin head within a given HMM molecule in 381 our experimental conditions were in the range of ~ 6 - 8 nm , slightly larger than the working 382 stroke size of 5 nm reported for myosin S1 ( Capitanio et al . , 2006 ) and slightly smaller than 383 the values obtained from structural studies with single - headed myosin ( ~ 10 - 12 nm ) ( Geeves 384 et al . , 2005 ) . It is comparable with studies performed with myosin molecules evaluated with 385 laser tweezers and single fiber mechanics ( Finer et al . , 1994 ; Tyska et al . , 1999 ; Piazzesi et 386 al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , our results are consistent with studies utilizing different techniques . 387 388 Cooperativity between myosin motors 389 There are several studies suggesting that myosin molecules work cooperatively ( Vilfan & 390 Duke , 2003 ; Hilbert et al . , 2013 ; Kaya et al . , 2017 ; Hwang et al . , 2021 ) , and that the work 391 produced by assemblies of motors is different from individual motors . For instance , a study 392 using synthetic myosin filaments measured 4 nm stepwise actin displacements at a high load 393 ( > 30 pN ) . Due to the fact that the mechanical work of 4 × 30 pN nm = 120 pN nm ≈ 30 k B T 394 ( k B : Bolzmann constant ; T absolute temperature ) is greater than the free energy of Mg . ATP 395 turnover ( 25 k B T ) , the authors concluded that the steps they observed could not be produced 396 by single motors but potentially due to coordinated force generation by several myosin 397 motors ( Kaya et al . , 2017 , Hwang et al . , 2021 ) . Despite the fact that theoretical analysis 398 ( Duke , 1999 ; Månsson , 2020 ) suggests that this finding is consistent with previous models of 399 independent force generators as proposed previously ( Huxley , 1957 ; Huxley , 1988 ; Hill , 400 1974 ) , it casted some doubt on this concept when motors work in arrays . In this regard , the 401 present study is consistent with fully independent force - generators along the actin filaments . 402 Importantly , the HS - AFM approach allows us to demonstrate that this applies for neighboring 403 actin target zones separated by ~ 37 nm , appreciably shorter than possible to resolve under 404 19 dynamic conditions using fluorescence microscopy ( e . g . Desai et al , 2015 ) . This result does 405 not seem to be consistent with previous findings suggesting that binding of a myosin head 406 allosterically affects the properties of the entire actin filament with potential changes of 407 myosin affinity at other sites ( Tokuraku et al . , 2009 ) . However , because we have only 408 performed our studies under a limited number of specific conditions , we cannot completely 409 exclude that such allosteric effects occur under certain conditions , e . g . at submicromolar 410 concentrations of Mg . ATP as in some of the experiments of Tokuraku et al 2009 . In contrast 411 to the results with pure F - actin we found strong evidence for cooperativity between 412 neighboring thin filament target zones as further considered in detail below . 413 414 Another form of cooperativity has been suggested by X - ray diffraction studies using muscle 415 fibre preparations , indicating that the two heads of a given myosin molecule may bind 416 sequentially to resist stretch of the active muscle ( Brunello et al . , 2007 ) . Such sequential 417 actions of the two heads have also been suggested ( Edman et al . , 1997 , Huxley & Tideswell , 418 1997 ; Conibear & Geeves , 1998 ) to occur during shortening to account for rapid repriming of 419 the myosin power - stroke after a quick release , high power output during shortening and other 420 phenomena . To the best of our knowledge interhead cooperativity has , however , not 421 previously been observed experimentally under dynamic conditions in the presence of ATP . 422 Our demonstration that binding of one myosin head increases the probability for binding of 423 the second head is thus unique by demonstrating the potential for inter - head cooperativity 424 where binding of one head increases the probability of binding of the second head to another . 425 The demonstration for this potential is of interest despite the fact that the distance between 426 neighboring , roughly parallel actin filaments in our study is appreciably larger than in the 427 muscle sarcomere . On the other hand , the inter - filament distance in our experiments is not 428 20 very different from the next - neighbour inter - filament distance between actin filaments in the 429 hexagonal arrangement of thin filaments that surround each thick filament in the sarcomere . 430 In contrast to the inter - head cooperativity involving binding each of the HMM heads between 431 two filaments , we did not study cooperativity of the double - head HMM binding to a filament 432 ( similar to in vitro motility or laser - trapping ) , due to the uncertainty to recognize the binding of 433 specific HMM molecules in subsequent HS - AFM frames ( Matusovsky et al . , 2021 ) . 434 435 Cooperativity between myosin motors that involves activation of the thin filament 436 Studies have shown that myosin binding to actin is required for full activation of the thin 437 filament ( McKillop and Geeves 1993 , Smith & Geeves , 2003 ; Desai et al . , 2015 ) . When 438 myosin binds to actin , it may directly affect the regulatory system by changing the 439 conformation of Tm , such that other myosin heads can attach to thin filaments ( Geeves & 440 Holmes , 1999 ; Gordon , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2003 ) . According to this model , with the transition 441 from weak to strong actin – myosin binding , the myosin heads transfer Tm to an open state , 442 making neighboring myosin binding sites on actin available for myosin binding . Our data are 443 consistent with this model , as we observed that the binding of one motor to the activated thin 444 filament ( pCa 4 . 5 ) has changes the attachment kinetics of neighboring motors compared to 445 non - activated thin filaments ( pCa 9 . 0 ) in the blocked state or the bare actin filaments . Most 446 specifically , when one motor is bound to the activated thin filament at the pCa 4 . 5 , it moves 447 the thin filament from the closed to the open state , which allows for further motor binding at 448 nearby sites . 449 450 In a previous study , we showed that the interaction of HMM with cTFs caused a change in 451 the thin filament conformation , both in the absence and presence of Ca 2 + , and in the absence 452 21 and presence of different concentrations of ATP ( Matusovsky et al . , 2019 ) . Our new data 453 strengthen those findings and corroborate the idea that cooperativity of myosin heads in 454 striated muscles is defined by thin filaments and their state of activation . We evaluated 455 whether one head in a HMM molecule could activate the thin filament in the presence of ATP 456 at low or high Ca 2 + concentrations . Under non - activating conditions ( presence of ATP , pCa 457 9 . 0 ) when cTFs were in the blocked state , myosin heads were able to bind to cTFs but not 458 able to switch the filaments from the blocked to the closed state , showing a similar decrease 459 in the binding probability and fractional occupancy ( Fig . 4e ) when compared to the F - actin - 460 HMM complex ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , binding of the two myosin heads are required for the transition 461 of a thin filament from the blocked to the close state ( Fig . 4 ) . However , the situation is 462 changed if myosin heads bind to cTFs under activation conditions ( presence of ATP and pCa 463 4 . 5 ) , showing an increase in the probability of binding and the relative number of motors 464 attached to thin filaments , as a result of a first myosin binding ( Figs 3 and 4g , Movies S3 , S4 ) . 465 These results suggest that one head ( upper or lower heads of a given HMM molecule bound 466 between two filaments ) is able to switch a thin filament from the closed to the open state . 467 468 In addition to the cooperative phenomena considered above , our results also demonstrate 469 higher affinity of myosin heads to the thin filaments in comparison to the actin filaments . This 470 follows from the higher average number of the HMM heads bound ( 2 . 32 ± 0 . 06 ) to cTFs ( Fig . 471 4h ) than to the non - regulated actin filaments ( 1 . 27 ± 0 . 07 ; Fig . 3f ) and the slower decline in 472 the total number of available heads in the former case . These findings are broadly consistent 473 with previous observations that both tension and the average number of attached cross - 474 bridges was increased in actin - reconstituted skinned muscle fibres after furhter reconstitution 475 with thin filament regulatory proteins ( Fujita et al , 2002 ) . 476 22 477 To summarize , our data suggest that cooperativity between neighboring myosin molecule 478 along a filament is primarily defined by the state of thin filament activation . In contrast , we find 479 no evidence for cooperative effects attributed to allosteric changes along pure actin filaments . 480 481 482 Materials and Methods 483 Proteins 484 Native thin filaments were purified from rabbit right and left ventricular cardiac muscle that 485 had been glycerinated and actin was purified from acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle 486 ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , following a protocol previously used in our laboratory ( Matusovsky et 487 al . , 2019 ) . The double - headed skeletal myosin II was purified from rabbit psoas muscle and 488 HMM fragments were prepared by proteolysis of the myosin with α - chymotrypsin ( Oakville , 489 Ontario , Canada ) as previously described ( Cheng et al . , 2019 ) . Prior of the HS - AFM 490 experiments , HMM , F - actin and thin filaments were tested for their functionality using in - vitro 491 motility and Mg 2 + - ATPase activity assays , as previously described ( Matusovsky et al . , 2019 ) . 492 493 The lipid bilayer template surface and experimental design 494 The lipid composition for HS - AFM imaging contained 1 , 2 - Dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - 495 phosphocholine ( DPPC , Avanti Polar Lipids ) , 1 , 2 - Dipalmitoyl - 3 - trimethylammonium - propane 496 ( DPTAP , Avanti Polar Lipids ) and 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( cap 497 biotinyl ) ( biotin - cap - DPPE , Avanti Polar Lipids ) . DPPC : DPTAP : biotin - cap - DPPE were mixed 498 in a weight ratio of 89 : 10 : 1 . The preparation of lipid vesicles and deposition on mica substrate 499 23 to form a mica - supported lipid bilayer surface ( mica - SLB ) has been previously described 500 ( Matusovsky et al . , 2021 ) . 501 The mica - SLB surface was rinsed with the buffer A , containing 25 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 502 0 . 25 mM EGTA , 1 . 25 mM Imidazole - HCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT , ( pH 7 . 0 ) . Subsequently , 2 . 8 µl of 503 either 7 µM non - regulated actin filaments or 1 . 0 µM regulated cTFs diluted in the buffer A 504 were deposited on the mica - SLB surface and incubated for 10 minutes in a wet chamber . At 505 these conditions , many filaments were attached to the surface in close proximity to each 506 other . The distance distributions between two parallel non - regulated actin filaments and 507 regulated cTFs are shown in Fig . S2 . The observed distances were enough for binding the 508 HMM heads between two parallel filaments , allowing counting of the exact number of HMM 509 molecules at the given time of the experiment . We studied cooperativity of binding of the 510 myosin heads in F - actin - HMM or cTF - HMM complexes using the following experimental 511 conditions : i ) nucleotide - free ( NF ) state ; ii ) presence of ATP analogs ( ATP - γ - S ) ; iii ) presence 512 of ATP and Ca 2 + . 513 514 HS - AFM imaging of F - actin - HMM complex 515 After rinsing unbound actin filaments with buffer A , 3 . 0 µl of 8 nM HMM diluted in buffer A 516 was placed on top of non - regulated actin filaments on the mica - SLB surface , and incubated 517 for an additional 3 minutes . The F - actin - HMM complex in nucleotide - free ( NF ) conditions was 518 rinsed by 10 μl of buffer A , containing either NPE - caged ATP , non - caged ATP ( 0 . 5 , 2 or 10 519 µM ) or 0 . 5 µM non - hydrolyzable ATP - γ - S . NPE - caged ATP ( adenosine 5’ - triphosphate , P3 - 520 ( 1 - ( 2 - nitrophenyl ethyl ) ester ) ( Invitrogen ) dissolved in attachment buffer was photolyzed in 521 the AFM chamber using an UV light source at 340 nm . A delay of ~ 5 - 10 seconds was found 522 after activation of caged ATP , likely because caged ATP molecules were in solution and 523 24 required this time to attach to and get hydrolyzed in the motor domain of HMM . To ensure 524 nucleotide free conditions 1 U / µl of apyrase was added to the solution . Further , 1 U / ml of 525 hexokinase and 10 mM glucose were added to the ADP solutions to remove contaminating 526 ATP . The F - actin - HMM complex was formed on the mica - SLB surface in the buffer A with 527 low ( pCa 9 . 0 ) or high ( pCa 4 . 5 ) Ca 2 + concentrations to ensure similar experimental conditions 528 as for cTFs - HMM complex . 529 530 HS - AFM imaging of cTFs - HMM complex 531 The procedure for imaging the cTFs - HMM complex was similar to that explained above for 532 non - regulated actin filaments . Imaging of the cTFs - HMM complex at low Ca 2 + ( pCa 9 . 0 ) or 533 high Ca 2 + ( pCa 4 . 5 ) concentrations , using skeletal muscle HMM was performed in the 534 following way : 2 - 20 μL of TFs ( 1 μM ) in the buffer A ( relaxing conditions , absence of Ca 2 + ) 535 were placed on a mica - SLB surface for 10 min in the wet chamber and unbound cTFs were 536 removed by exchanging for the buffer B , containing low or high Ca 2 + concentrations . Then , 537 3 . 0 μL of skeletal muscle HMM ( 8 nM ) in buffer A was placed on top of the mica - SLB surface 538 with bound cTFs for 10 min in the wet chamber . Unbound HMM was washed out by buffer A 539 followed by washing several times with appropriate buffer B with low or high Ca 2 + 540 concentrations containing 0 . 5 - 2 μM of caged or non - caged ATP as desired . 541 542 Probability of binding , fractional occupancies and cooperativity analysis 543 Probability of the HMM heads binding to the non - regulated or regulated actin filaments was 544 calculated by binomial distribution evaluated in HS - AFM experiments . This assumes that the 545 binding situation in each frame is treated as an independent event because each myosin 546 head is assumed to undergo independent cycling ( possibly several times per frame ) . The 547 25 bound and unbound events ( 0 – no binding , 1 – binding ) were visualized directly to compute 548 probabilities for the binding - unbinding process as a ratio of the binding events to the total 549 number of events in each independent frame . Our experimental design allows to visualize 4 - 6 550 HMM molecules ( or 8 - 12 individual heads ) bound between two filaments . Two typical 551 scanning views and rates were used : 150 × 75 nm 2 ( 80 × 40 pixels 2 ) at the 6 . 7 - 10 frame per 552 second ( fps ) and 200 × 200 nm 2 ( 120 × 120 pixels 2 ) at the 2 fps . 553 554 Fractional Occupancy ( θ ) is the ratio of the actin - binding sites occupied by HMM heads to the 555 total number of the actin binding sites experimentally observed in the given time of the 556 experiment and calculated from : 557 558 θ = [ bound sites ] [ bound sites ] + [ unbound sites ] 559 Cooperative probability which is related to the probability of binding was calculated from : 560 561 𝐶 = ( 𝑛𝑘 ) 𝑝 𝑘 ( 1 − 𝑝 ) 𝑛−𝑘 562 where C denotes cooperative probability of binding , n = number of total events or subsequent 563 frames of the experiment ; k = number of binding events in the experiment , p = probability of 564 binding , 1 - p = probability of unbinding and ( 𝑛𝑘 ) represents the combination of the total and 565 binding events expressed as : 𝑛 ! 𝑘 ! ( 𝑛−𝑘 ) ! . 566 567 The events for each myosin head calculated from the reference frame , i . e . a moment when 568 the head was bound to the filament until the end of image acquisition . The total events 569 26 included both binding events ( head was bound to actin filament ) and unbinding events ( head 570 was unbind from actin filament ) . 571 572 Analysis of the myosin displacements 573 To analyze the HMM displacement , each of the HMM heads bound between two parallel non - 574 regulated or regulated actin filaments were tracked individually in successive HS - AFM 575 frames . The tracked parameters included the height of the HMM head used for subsequent 576 determination of the center of mass ( COM ) in each myosin head . The height of the HMM 577 heads was determined in semi - automatic mode using the x , y , and z data of the HS - AFM 578 frames in Kodec software ( v . 4 . 4 . 7 . 39 ) ( Ngo et al . , 2015 ) . The x and y data correspond to the 579 lateral coordinates , while the observed z values correspond to the highest point in the center 580 of the HMM heads . To obtain the z values for the highest point in HMM head ( s ) the image 581 was automatically searched within a 5 × 5 pixels area . Next , the obtained height values and 582 x , y positions within the 5 × 5 pixels area were used to automatically calculate the COM . To 583 obtain the accurate COM values , the height of the surface outside of the actin - HMM position 584 was subtracted from the average COM of the HMM heads . The displacement size was 585 calculated as a difference in the COM position of HMM head in the reference frame and the 586 next frame , in successive HS - AFM frames . The forward and backward displacements were 587 calculated for each myosin head , plotted and fitted by sum of two Gaussians . The 588 displacement size of the upper and lower HMM heads did not differ between each other , 589 although the frequency and binding events were not correlated between two heads within one 590 HMM molecule . The displacement size was also not affected by the range of the ATP 591 concentrations used in our experiments ( 0 . 2 μM , 0 . 5 μM , 2 μM , 10 μM ) , thus we averaged the 592 27 data with the sampling rate of 589 events for the non - regulated actin filaments and 911 593 events for the regulated cTFs . 594 595 Cross - sectional analysis 596 Cross - sectional analysis was performed by Kodec software ( Ngo et al . , 2015 ) to calculate the 597 distance between two filaments ( Fig . S2 ) . 598 HS - AFM system and cantilevers 599 The experiments were performed on a tapping - mode HS - AFM system ( RIBM ) ( Ando et al . , 600 2001 ) , equipped with an additional UV laser . Olympus cantilevers BL - AC10DS - A2 with the 601 following parameters were used : spring constant 0 . 08 - 0 . 15 N / m ; quality factor in water ~ 1 . 4 - 602 1 . 6 ; resonance frequency in water 0 . 6 - 1 . 2 MHz . The additional carbon probe tip was 603 fabricated on the tip of a cantilever by electron - beam deposition and sharped by plasma 604 etcher , giving a ~ 4 nm tip apex . The tip – sample loading force can be modulated and 605 decreased by the free oscillation peak - to - peak amplitude ( A 0 ) of the cantilever set to ~ 2 . 0 nm 606 and the amplitude set point adjusted to more than 0 . 9 A 0 . 607 608 Data analysis and processing of HS - AFM images 609 To remove spike noise and to make the xy - plane flat , the HS - AFM images were processed 610 with low - pass filtering using Kodec software ( 4 . 4 . 7 . 39 ) . The COM and cross - correlation 611 analyses were performed in Kodec software . Fittings of equations to the observed data were 612 performed in GraphPad Prism software ( v . 9 . 3 . 0 ) . Values are reported as mean ± Standard 613 Deviation or 95 % Confidential Intervals throughout the paper as indicated . Number of n 614 equals to independent experiments . A level of significance of p < 0 . 05 was used for all 615 analyses . 616 28 617 Data availability 618 All data required for evaluation of the conclusions in the paper are present in the main body 619 of the paper and / or in the Supporting Information . 620 621 Acknowledgments 622 This work was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of 623 Canada ( to D .
