If the load of the membrane controlled the rates of endocytosis , exocytosis or of lamellipodial retraction and extension , the cell would ‘automatically’adjust the mem - brane area to compensate for changes in morphology , growth or secretory activity . For example , if the membrane area was too small , the increased resistance to movement of membrane into an endocytic vesicle would decrease the rate of endocytosis but would allow exocytosis to proceed normally , the result being a net increase in the membrane area . So , the physical load involved in moving membranes will naturally set the balance of membrane transport in the endocytic and exocytic pathways , and the balance of process extension and retraction in a physical feed - back control system 1 . What determines the load of the plasma membrane ? In almost all cells , the plasma membrane bilayer is an inelastic , two - dimensional fluid ; therefore , for membrane to flow laterally into new areas , bonds to old areas must be broken . Resistance to the movement of membrane would come from tension in the membrane if the cell was round and had no cytoskeletal support . However , most animal cells have complex morphologies because the membrane adheres strongly to the cytoskeleton . In ani - mal cells , movement of membrane into an endocytic vesicle or lamellipodium requires movement of bilayer away from mem - brane – cytoskeleton bonds . Thus , much of the load of forming a vesicle or a lamel - lipodium should be the energy of mem - brane – cytoskeleton adhesion . Biophys . Res . Commun . 272 , 586 – 590 ( 2000 ) . 39 . Walker , M .

Sheetz OPINION The rates of mechanochemical processes , such as endocytosis , membrane extension and membrane resealing after cell wounding , are known to be controlled biochemically , through interaction with regulatory proteins . Here , I propose that these rates are also controlled physically , through an apparently continuous adhesion between plasma membrane lipids and cytoskeletal proteins . Many cellular processes have important mechanochemical components . These include some obvious mechanical activities such as endocytosis , cell motility and mem - brane resealing , but also others , such as repli - cation and transcription . Taking the motor proteins as an example of mechanochemical enzymes , it is clear that both physical and bio - chemical controls can modify the rate of motor movement . For all motors , an inverse relationship exists between the rate of move - ment and the force resisting movement , called ‘load’ . Above a certain load , the motor force cannot overcome the resisting force , and the motor stops . An analogous situation probably exists for membrane mechanochemical activ - ities . For example , the endocytic machinery has to generate sufficient force to bend the membrane bilayer and form an endocytic vesicle . If the resistance of the plasma mem - brane — the load — is stronger than the force exerted by the endocytic machinery , no vesi - Endocytosis a Tether formation b B B γ γ T m T m Figure 1 | The energetics of endocytic vesicle formation are similar to those of tether formation . This diagram illustrates that the factors that contribute to the load of forming a vesicle are the same as those that contribute to forming a tether . The major factor is the membrane – cytoskeleton adhesion energy , γ , which must be overcome to separate membrane from cytoskeleton . A secondary term is the tension in the bilayer plane , T m , which resists deformation of the membrane . Because the curvature of vesicles and tethers are similar , the force needed to bend the membrane should be similar ( membrane bending stiffness , B , defines the force for a given radius of curvature 39 ) . See Box 1 for details . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd P E R S P E C T I V E S vate stretch channels 4 . Conversely , in hip - pocampal growth cones , separation of the membrane from the end of the filopodia with laser tweezers , which lowers the load of the membrane , stimulates the rate of assembly of actin in the filopodia ( D . Wayne and M . S . , unpublished results ) . Thus , the rate of actin polymerization seems to depend directly on the membrane load . Load - dependent effects might also pro - vide a simple mechanism to control cell mor - phology . During mitosis , cells round up , and the change in morphology could be explained by the fall in the rate of exocytosis at metaphase and the subsequent rise at cytoki - nesis . At metaphase , the decreased rate of exo - cytosis measurably increases the load on the plasma membrane . This , in turn , probably inhibits membrane extension , causing cells to round up 2 . When the cells enter cytokinesis and secretion resumes , the measured drop of the load back to interphase levels might be what allows cells to extend processes again to spread and assume a more irregular shape . Endocytosis Endocytosis ( we are considering total endo - cytosis rate , both receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis ) is important for many cell functions because nutrients are endocytosed for growth and receptors are endocytosed in signalling . For active cells , an area of membrane equal to the plasma membrane is endocytosed in about an hour and , under steady - state conditions , the endocytosis rate must match the exocytosis rate . From the point of view of energetics , the formation of an endocytic vesicle can be compared to the formation of a membrane tether — a cylindrical tube of membrane that can be pulled out by applying a force orthogonal to a small area of membrane bilayer ( FIG . 1 ) . Indeed , both processes involve the separation of a portion of the membrane from the cytoskeleton and strong bending of the membrane . Therefore , the energy needed to form a vesicle per unit area should be related to the energy needed to pull a tether per unit area 2 . So , we should be able to calculate a meaningful index of membrane load by measuring the force nec - essary to pull a tether ( BOX 1 ) . This prediction has been verified experi - mentally for situations in which the rate of endocytosis undergoes important changes : stimulated secretion and mitosis . In rat basophilic leukaemia ( RBL ) cells , an increase in stimulated secretion is accompanied by a decrease in tether force and a rise in endocy - tosis rate 3 . Agents that inhibit secretion also inhibit the drop in tether force and rise in endocytosis rate . In mitosis , there is a marked rise in the membrane tether force , which parallels the drop in endocytosis rate 2 . The addition of amphiphilic compounds including detergents , lipids and solvents , results in a parallel decrease in tether force and rise in endocytosis rate 2 , 4 . During mito - sis , therefore , endocytosis rates are modulat - ed physically by changes in apparent mem - brane tension ( BOX 1 ) , either in parallel with the biochemical inhibition of key regulators of the endocytic machinery 5 , or through an entirely different mechanism . Process extension The extension of leading lamellipodia depends on the assembly of actin filaments in a complex process that involves many pro - tein components 6 – 8 . Actin filaments with similar characteristics can also be assembled in vitro on the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes or on inert beads 9 . Membranes that contain the highly charged inositol lipid phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) are particu - larly active in creating actin filament tails in vitro and a role has been proposed for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in catalysing the assembly of actin through the recruitment of Cdc42 and Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) 10 , 11 . Although many proteins have been implicated in the in vivo process of actin filament assembly , the mechanism by which the overall rate of assembly is con - trolled is unclear . Because extension of the leading edge by actin polymerization involves the movement of bilayer from the mass of the cytoplasm to the lamellipodium and possibly away from the spectrin – actin cytoskeleton 12 , the resis - tance to extension might be similar to the resistance to tether formation 13 . So , it is per - haps not surprising that as the rate of leading edge extension in 3T3 cells increases , the teth - er force decreases 14 . Moreover , when these cells are swollen osmotically to increase artifi - cially the load of the plasma membrane , filopodia retract at forces well below the forces needed to lyse the membrane or acti - NATURE REVIEWS | MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 2 | MAY 2001 | 393 Box 1 | Measuring the tether force An experimental parameter that correlates well with endocytic and lamellipodial extension rates is the tether force ( the force needed to hold a plasma membrane tether at constant length with laser tweezers ) 22 . This tether force depends on membrane bending stiffness , tension in the membrane bilayer plane , and membrane – cytoskeleton adhesion 39 , but not on the initial length of the tether 40 . When tether force increases as a result of perturbation of the cell , there is normally a proportional decrease in tether diameter , which is expected if the membrane bending stiffness is constant ( EQN 1 ) . The membrane in - plane tension term seems to be nearly constant for the whole cell membrane even across the junctions of epithelial cells ( FIG . 2b ) , or on blebs of the plasma membrane , where the membrane has separated from the cytoskeleton 24 ( FIG . 2b ) and can increase markedly with hypotonic swelling . Under normal conditions , the main changes in tether force result from changes in cytoskeleton – membrane adhesion 22 , 24 . It is useful to relate tether force ( F o ) to other membrane parameters such as the adhesion energy per unit area ( γ ) , and the level of in - plane tension ( T m ) . The mathematical relationship between these parameters and the membrane bending stiffness ( B ) ( on average 3 × 10 – 12 dyne . cm ) has been tested experimentally and verified for lipid vesicles . The in - plane tension and cytoskeleton adhesion terms are difficult to separate and are therefore combined into a single term , apparent membrane tension ( T ) . To separate adhesion and in - plane tension , we can measure the tether force on blebs lacking cytoskeleton support ( F b ) , where the adhesion term ( γ ) equals 0 . Under these conditions , ( EQN 1 ) becomes : If we assume that the in - plane tension is a constant over smooth regions of the cell surface , then a measurement of tether force on a cytoskeletally supported region of a cell ( where EQN 1 applies ) and a bleb ( where EQN 2 applies ) can be use to calculate the adhesion energy : Experimentally , the tether force on blebs is less than half that on regions supported by the cytoskeleton ( F b < 0 . 5 F o ) . Applying this inequality to equation ( EQN 3 ) , we see that over 75 % of the apparent membrane tension term is from adhesion . Therefore , large changes in apparent membrane tension as measured by tether force primarily reflect changes in adhesion .

Furthermore , the membrane rebinds to the cytoskeleton just as rapidly after the tether moves on . Similar conclusions can be reached when studying the formation of blebs . Normally , cells have a small outward pres - sure , which is probably generated by con - traction of the cortical cytoskeleton 24 . When the membrane bilayer separates from the cytoskeleton , it normally extends outward rapidly to form a hemispherical protrusion or bleb ( FIG . 2 ) . Although excessive bleb for - mation is a hallmark of cell death , blebs will also form on occasions near lamellipodia , cleavage furrows 25 , and in cells that are missing the actin binding protein , filamin 26 . The membrane forms a bleb when the bilayer is not supported by adhesion to the cytoskeleton for a 1 – 2 µ m 2 area . If a cell is to remain viable , actin filaments must rapidly assemble in a bleb so that the mem - brane bilayer will once again be supported by the cytoskeleton . Molecular basis of adhesion The rapid dynamics of membrane – cytoskeleton adhesion are better explained by many weak bonds between membrane lipids and cytoskeletal proteins than by a few strong bonds between membrane glycopro - teins and cytoskeletal proteins ( FIG . 3 ) . Apart from the discrete cell – cell and cell – extracel - lular - matrix ( ECM ) binding sites , there seem to be relatively few sites of membrane protein – cytoskeleton attachment , particu - larly on the non - adherent surfaces of cells in culture . For non - adherent membrane , multitude of rapidly changing morphologies like a dynamic tight - fitting glove . This aspect of bilayer – cytoskeleton adhesion is well illus - trated by the behaviour of tethers . When tethers ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 µ m in diameter ) are formed on neuronal growth cones , they can be dragged laterally 20 over long distances at rapid rates ( > 2 µ ms – 1 ) with low forces ( ~ 7 pN ) . Because 7 pN is insufficient to extract Membrane resealing Resealing of plasma membranes after mechanical lysis is a crucial process for pre - serving cell viability . Initially , many experi - menters correlated vesicle movement and membrane fusion to resealing , and concluded that secretion is required for resealing 15 . Further studies related resealing to secretion after Ca 2 + entry 16 , 17 . Recent studies have shown that the rate of membrane resealing after mechanical lysis inversely correlates with static tether force 18 . This raises the possibility that secretion might in fact be required to lower the membrane tension . Indeed , decreasing the load of the plasma membrane by depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin is sufficient to allow mem - brane resealing and , under these conditions , neither secretion nor Ca 2 + entry is required 19 . So , a decrease in membrane – cytoskeleton adhesion can favour the resealing process , either in parallel with other factors or by an independent mechanism .

In epithelial cells , blebs form on both apical and basolateral surfaces . When measured after ATP depletion in kidney epithelial cells , tether force ( t f ) was 7 pN on blebs . On adjacent regions of the basolateral membrane that were supported by the cytoskeleton , the tether force was 14 pN . In the apical region , the presence of a dense cortical actin network correlated with an even higher tether force of 22 pN ( REF . 24 ) .

Most important for this discussion is the experimental finding that adhesion seems to be a continuum property of the membrane . Previous models of membrane structure have depicted adhesion as discrete mem - brane protein – cytoskeleton bonds that are discontinuously spaced on a scale larger than tethers and presumably have slower dynam - ics than observed with lateral tether move - ments . Because many PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 adhesive interactions occur in a membrane surface area of the size of a tether , endocytic vesicle or filopodium , they appear as a continuum as opposed to individual binding sites . Both physical and biochemical controls are important for regulating cellular func - tions through the plasma membrane . I have emphasized the physical and chemical aspects of the plasma membrane and par - ticularly the membrane – cytoskeleton adhe - sion and in - plane tension because many recent experiments show a strong correla - tion between membrane mechanical func - tions and adhesion . In approaching the molecular basis of adhesion , the cytoplas - mic surface of the plasma membrane is very crowded , and how the level of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and the affinities of the many PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding proteins are controlled is very much a mystery . It is surprising how rapidly an actin cytoskeleton forms beneath blebs and invaginations 26 , 38 in healthy cells and creates a cytoskeleton to support the mem - brane . Although it is attractive to think that adhesion and tension provide a simple mechanism to set the surface area - to - vol - ume ratio of cells automatically in response to cellular changes , we need a better under - standing of the links between physical para - meters and biochemical functions . What our estimates are in the range of about 1 µ m between attachments 27 , but even the highest estimates of contact density are only 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 µ m between attachments ( A . Kusumi and K . Jacobson , personal communication ) . Conversely , there are many cytoskeleton – lipid interaction sites . For example , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is present at a concentration of 1 , 000 – 10 , 000 molecules per µ m 2 of mem - brane . Although individual binding interac - tions between PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cytoskeletal proteins are weak ( for example , pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains have K a ’s of 10 4 – 10 6 M – 1 ) , the high density of interacting components and their localization in two dimensions along the surface of the mem - brane assure that the effective concentra - tions are high , and so the bilayer and cytoskeleton adhere seemingly continuously . Membrane lipids interact with many cytoskeletal proteins ( reviewed by REF . 28 ) and some of the in vitro interactions of pro - teins with lipid surfaces have been charac - terized ( for example , REFS 29 – 31 ) . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 seems to be important for strengthening membrane – cytoskeleton interactions . Blebs form readily when PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is sequestered by high levels of a chimera between green fluorescent protein and the PH domain of phospholipase C δ or when PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is hydrolysed by a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatase 22 , 32 . The strongest in vitro interactions are between the phosphorylated inositol lipids and cationic protein domains , such as the PH domains , or the lipid - binding domains of pipmodulins ( reviewed in REF . 33 ) , such as MARCKS ( REF . 29 ) . However , it is difficult to predict how these lipids and proteins will interact in vivo because many proteins com - pete for access to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane ( FIG . 4 ) ; in the ery - throcyte membrane , the density of protein in the 5 - nm area adjacent to the membrane surface is estimated to be greater than 600 mg ml – 1 ( REF . 34 ) . Changes in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels are implicated in many physiological changes in adhesion between the membrane and the cytoskeleton . In the case of stimulated secre - tion in mast cells , one of the early events is the hydrolysis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( REF . 35 ) . A drop in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration corre - lates temporally with the rapid and marked drop in membrane – cytoskeleton adhesion that precedes secretion 3 . There is also con - siderable evidence that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has a role in cell motility . Many of the hormonal stimuli that activate cell motility also acti - vate phospholipase C , which hydrolyses PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and this correlates with the observed drop in tether force 14 . Many of the proteins involved in actin dynamics ( for example , small GTPases of the Rac / Rho family ) are modulated by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding proteins 8 , and cytoskeletal proteins that have PH domains are either associated with vesicles or located close to the plasma membrane . Physical controls of cellular processes In this article , I have described how mem - brane – cytoskeleton adhesion could alter the rate of various cell functions over the whole cell surface . Secretion events on one side of the cell can be compensated by increased endocytosis on the other side and the block of secretion in mitosis can automatically cause a decrease in endocytosis rate . So the level of membrane cytoskeleton adhesion can control the general form of a cell through its effect on motility and surface area to volume ratio 36 , 37 . Membrane – cytoskeleton adhesion at the biochemical level seems to depend strongly on the level of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which has dual functions , stimulating actin polymerization and bind - ing to cytoskeleton - attached proteins that have cationic domains . Other physical chemical properties of cell plasma mem - branes , such as membrane potential or bilayer asymmetry , can control or influence NATURE REVIEWS | MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 2 | MAY 2001 | 395 Figure 4 | Competition for membrane - binding sites . The cytoplasmic membrane surface is crowded with many more proteins wanting access to the surface than can bind there . A signal that causes an increase in the affinity or avidity of one protein ( for example , a cytoskeleton - bound protein ) for the membrane would result in an increase in the concentration of that protein at the surface and a decrease in the concentration of other proteins ( for example , a soluble phosphatidylinositol kinase ) at the surface .
