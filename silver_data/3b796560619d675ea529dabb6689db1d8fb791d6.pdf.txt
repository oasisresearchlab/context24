These earlier reports mostly character - ized actin filament assembly , gelation kinetics , and ensuing changes in their mechanical properties induced by a single F - actin crosslinker . However , in cells , these auxiliary proteins often localize in the same subcellular areas . The close spatial proximity of different crosslinking proteins suggests that these proteins may cooperate to organize F - actin stuctures to drive complex cellular functions during cell adhesion , motility and division . Here we hypothesize that a - actinin and filamin , two major F - actin cross - linking proteins that are both present in the lamella of adherent cells [ 4 – 8 ] , display synergistic mechanical functions . Filamin and a - actinin are critical to structural functions of skeletal and smooth muscle cells [ 6 , 7 , 9 ] . Both a - actinin and filamin are involved in cell signaling by connecting integrins to the cytoskeleton [ 10 , 11 ] . There is no evidence that filamin and a - actinin interact directly , but they simultaneously interact with F - actin , with similar association and dissociation rates , at different actin binding regions with little evidence of competition [ 12 ] , while other auxiliary proteins such as tropomyosin [ 13 ] and talin [ 10 ] compete for these sites . FATZ and myozenin are Z - line proteins that each individually both bind and form complexes with both a - actinin and filamin in skeletal muscles to help promote F - actin function and regulate cytoskeletal arrangements [ 9 , 14 ] . Both a - actinin and filamin have two actin - binding sites separated by a relatively flexible molecular arm . Therefore , a - actinin and filamin mediate the formation of orthogonal actin filament networks at low concentration [ 3 , 15 – 20 ] . At high concentrations , they induce the formation of bundles above a crosslinking - to - bundling threshold concentration , which are relatively disorganized com - pared to F - actin bundles formed by bona fide F - actin bundling protein fascin [ 19 ] . Our previous work has shown that F - actin bundling protein fascin and F - actin crosslinking protein a - actinin can work together to enhance the mechanical properties of F - actin networks more efficiently than these proteins alone [ 21 , 22 ] . Here we use quantitative rheology to investigate whether combining two bona fide crosslinking proteins , a - actinin and filamin , may affect the mechanical properties and dynamics of networks differently than a - actinin and filamin alone . Results a - actinin and filamin synergistically enhance the stiffness of F - actin networks We monitored the gelation of actin solutions in the presence of either a - actinin or filamin or both using a cone - and - plate PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 February 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 2 | e4411 rheometer . A strain - controlled rheometer measures the elastic modulus , G’ ( defined as the propensity of the polymers to rebound after shear deformation ) , and the viscous modulus , G’’ ( defined by how much the specimen can flow under stress ) , of the protein solutions following the onset of actin filament assembly . Upon addition of polymerizing salt , solutions of monomeric actin rapidly formed filamentous networks that exhibited an elasticity of , 6 dynes / cm 2 in the absence of crosslinking proteins ( Fig . 1 ) . In the presence of equimolar concentrations of a - actinin and filamin at 0 . 03 m M , 0 . 06 m M , and 0 . 12 m M each , the actin filament network elasticity increased in 3 h to 15 dynes / cm 2 , 45 dynes / cm 2 and 68 dynes / cm 2 , respectively ( Fig . 1 ) . It is no surprise that the network elasticity increased with increasing concentration of crosslinking proteins a - actinin and filamin ( Fig . 1 ) . However for the same total molar ratio of actin to auxiliary protein , the effect of combining a - actinin and filamin on F - actin network elasticity was much stronger than the separate effects of either a - actinin or filamin ( Fig . 2 ) . The elastic modulus of the networks normalized to the network modulus of F - actin alone was plotted as a function of total auxiliary protein concentration ( Fig . 2 ) . At a concentration of 0 . 12 m M , a - actinin and filamin alone increased the elasticity of F - actin by 2 - fold . In contrast , combining 0 . 06 m M a - actinin with 0 . 06 m M filamin resulted in a 8 - fold increase in network elasticity ( Fig . 2 ) . For higher auxiliary protein concentrations , this effect was qualitatively similar , but quantitatively different . Combining 0 . 12 m M of both a - actinin and filamin increased the elasticity , 12 - fold while adding 0 . 24 m M a - actinin alone only resulted in a 4 - fold increase ( Fig . 2 ) . Solutions containing 0 . 24 m M filamin is above the crosslinking - to - bundling threshold of filamin in F - actin solutions and , therefore , resulted in an elasticity that was , 22 - fold higher than that of F - actin alone ( Fig . 2 ) . Combining a - actinin and filamin drastically reduce the mobility of actin filaments in networks After the elastic modulus reached a steady state value , we measured the rheological response of F - actin networks to oscillatory shear deformations of small amplitude and increasing frequency v . Such measurements probe the ability of filaments to move and , therefore , relax mechanical stresses inside the networks [ 23 ] . The elasticity , G’ ( v ) , of F - actin networks increased with frequency in the presence and absence of auxiliary proteins ( Fig . 3A ) . The slope of this increase is dependent on the ability of filaments to move and relax mechanical stresses within the network . Filament movement can be restricted by entanglements formed by topologically overlapping filaments and / or by the crosslinking activity between filaments , which can also impede filament movements . The elasticity of F - actin networks containing 0 . 12 m M of either a - actinin or filamin increased steadily with frequency ( Fig . 3A ) . However , the elasticity of F - actin containing both a - actinin and filamin was significantly less dependent on frequency ( Fig . 3A ) . This result indicates that actin filaments inside networks containing both a - actinin and filamin are less mobile and , therefore , less inclined to relax mechanical stresses due to enhanced interfilament interactions than in networks containing only a - actinin or filamin . The frequency - dependent elasticity profiles ( Fig . 3A ) were fit to power laws of frequency , G’ ( v ) , v a , with an exponent , a , that describes the steepness of the frequency dependence of G’ ( v ) . The exponent , a , for networks of F - actin containing both a - actinin and filamin was significantly lower than for networks containing either a - actinin or filamin alone ( Fig . 3B ) . This result suggests that actin filaments in networks containing both a - actinin and filamin can slide less readily and , therefore , relax mechanical stresses than actin filaments in networks containing only a - actinin or filamin .

By comparison , the average phase angle of a glycerol solution and a 24 m M F - actin network is 90 u and 30 u , respectively . This result indicates that F - actin networks containing a - actinin and filamin are , from a rheological point of view , more solid - like than networks containing only a - actinin or filamin . F - actin networks are mechanically more resilient in the presence of both a - actinin and filamin So far we have investigated the mechanical response of F - actin networks subjected to deformations of amplitude small enough that these perturbations do not structurally change the organiza - tion of the networks . In this regime of small deformations , the magnitude of the stress induced in the network increases linearly with the input deformation and the elastic modulus is independent of the magnitude of the deformation . Here we investigate the rheological response of actin filament networks subjected to large deformations , which describes non - linear rheology . Actin filament networks containing a - actinin and filamin were subjected to step deformations of increasing amplitude ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . The step deformation ( strain ) of amplitude c 0 induces a stress , s , which eventually relaxes due to the movements of the filaments in solution . The modulus , G ( t , c 0 ) = s ( t , c 0 ) / c 0 , of the network is measured and a resulting yield strain , c c is calculated . c c is defined as the strain required for G ( t , c 0 ) to be reduced by 10 % .

For c 0 . c c , the modulus steadily decreased over all time scales probed presumably due to breakage or rearrangement of filaments within the network ( Fig . 4C ) . Solutions containing either 0 . 12 m M a - actinin or 0 . 12 m M filamin had similar profiles with the modulus reducing with applied deformation with c c of , 5 % and 8 % , respectively ( Fig . 4C ) . On the other hand , solutions with both a - actinin and filamin present , exhibited strain - hardening , a phenomenon in which the modulus , G ( t , c 0 ) , increases with increasing applied shear deformation ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) . The modulus increased from 70 to 150 dyn / cm 2 and then rapidly declined with a c c of , 2 % . Although networks containing both a - actinin and filamin display higher elasticity and increased resilience than networks formed by individual auxiliary proteins , they also break at a lower shear deformation ( Fig . 4C ) . Discussion Filamin and a - actinin are vital to structural functions of cells [ 6 ] ; they are localized to both the leading edge lamelipodia as well as the trailing stress fibers [ 5 , 7 ] . At the leading edge , in addition to fast remodeling of F - actin , both filamin and a - actinin can crosslink actin filaments to provide sufficient stiffness required for cells to protrude ; while in stress fibers of adherent cells , where significant mechanical strength is required , filamin and a - actinin bundle actin Figure 4 .

Previous rheological studies showed that they crosslink actin filaments up to the threshold concentration and then begin to bundle these filaments [ 15 , 17 ] . While these proteins can individually perform these functions , they may not be present is sufficient molar quantities to provide the mechanical integrity required by the cell . Despite a relatively similar molecular architecture – two actin - binding sites separated by a long flexible molecular arm – and similar affinity for F - actin crosslinking / bundling proteins filamin and a - actinin modulate the mechanical properties of F - actin networks differently . F - actin networks in the presence of low concentrations of filamin form mostly orthogonal structures ( i . e . no filament bundles are present ) and soften ( reduces their elastic modulus ) under shear stresses of increasing magnitude . F - actin / filamin networks display a relatively high phase angle , similar to that shown by F - actin network without crosslinking proteins [ 17 ] . Moreover , filaments in F - actin / filamin networks with low filamin concentrations display a mobility similar to filaments in F - actin networks . However , past a critical crosslinking - to - bundling transition concentration , F - actin / filamin networks strain - harden under shear stresses and display a small phase angle , i . e . these networks feature a much more solid - like rheological character than F - actin networks and F - actin / filamin networks at low filamin concentrations [ 17 ] . In striking contrast , F - actin networks containing a - actinin strain - harden under increasing shear stresses over a wide range of a - actinin concentrations . They also display a phase angle that decreases steadily for increasing a - actinin concentration , through the crosslinking - to - bundling transition concentration [ 18 ] . Our results suggest that combining these structurally similar , but functionally different F - actin crosslinking proteins create a novel hybrid mechanical behavior . Our results show that actin filaments polymerized in the presence of both filamin and a - actinin form a network that is stiffer than networks formed by either protein . At a molar concentration below the bundling threshold ( approximately 1 : 200 and 1 : 150 for filamin and actinin , respectively ) for either protein [ 15 , 17 ] , actin filaments form loose , orthogonal networks . However when both proteins are present even at a combined concentration less than their bundling threshold , they form F - actin networks that are less labile and exhibit a network strain - hardening under large forces similar to networks formed in the presence of bundling proteins such as fascin [ 17 , 19 , 20 , 24 ] . Above its critical concentration , filamin bundles actin filaments form networks that are stiffer than networks of mixed auxiliary proteins below their threshold concentration . Our results complement our previous studies that showed that auxiliary proteins synergistically enhance the mechanical proper - ties of F - actin networks to promote complex cellular functions during cell adhesion , polarization , motility and division [ 21 , 22 , 25 ] . Earlier studies suggested that the functions of cytoskeleton regulatory proteins may be redundant or not essential ; evidence of the synergistic mechanical effect of combining these proteins presented here infers that these proteins function cooperatively to provide the cell with the necessary optimal mechanical integrity . Since these two cytoskeleton proteins are localized in stress fibers of adherent cells and to the lamellipodium of protruding cells [ 5 ] , it is suggestive that a - actinin and filamin do not have redundant mechanical functions . Materials and Methods Purification of the proteins Unless specified , all reagents were obtained from Sigma . Actin was prepared from chicken breast [ 22 ] . Mg 2 + - actin filaments were generated by adding 0 . 1 volume of 10 - X KMEI ( 500 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , and 100 mM imidazole , pH 7 ) polymerizing salt to 0 . 9 volume of G - actin in buffer G ( 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1mM sodium azide , and 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 ) . Filamin and a - actinin were purified from chicken gizzard as described [ 26 , 27 ] . Quantitative rheology The mechanical properties of actin filament networks in the presence and absence of a - actinin and filamin were measured using a strain - controlled rheometer ( ARES - 100 TA Instrument , Piscataway , NJ ) [ 28 , 29 ] . A rheometer consists of a 50 - mm diameter cone and plate that form a space in which the specimen is placed . The deadtime for specimen loading in the rheometer is 30 s . The bottom plate applies oscillatory shear deformations of controlled amplitude and frequency and the induced stress is measured . The in - phase and out - of - phase components of the stress divided by the amplitude of the input deformation ( 1 % ) , i . e . the elastic modulus ( or elasticity ) , G’ , and the viscous modulus , G’’ , as well as the phase angle , d = tan 2 1 ( G’’ / G’ ) are computed . To measure the frequency - dependent elastic and viscous moduli of the actin filament networks , G’ ( v ) and G’’ ( v ) , oscillatory deformations of 1 % shear deformation and frequency between 0 . 01 and 100 rad / s are applied , respectively . Finally , step deformations of amplitude between 0 . 1 % and 100 % are applied to measure compute the shear modulus G ( t , c 0 ) as a function of time after shear application and deformation amplitude c 0 and compute the mechanical resilience of the networks . Statistics Statistical analysis was performed and mean values and standard error of measurement ( SEM ) were calculated and plotted using Graphpad Prism ( Graphpad Software , San Diego , CA ) . Two - tailed unpaired t tests were conducted to determine significance of differences in elastic modulus , phase angle , and exponent a . Significance was indicated using the standard Michelin Guide scale ( * * * for P , 0 . 001 , * * for P , 0 . 01 , and * for P , 0 . 05 ) .
