subjected to restricted diets during gestation . Meikle et al . ( 1984 ) observed that low - ranking female rhesus monkeys , Macaca mulatta , produced fewer offspring and fewer sons than high - ranking monkeys . Also , hamsters of advancing age and / or increasing parity produce smaller , more female - biased litters ( Huck et al . , 1988 ) . Therefore , it appears that the differential vulnerability of males in utero is exaggerated by various forms of mater - nal stress . The physiological mechanism by which this occurs is unknown at this time . Sex ratio modification by means of sex - differen - tial prenatal mortality can be considered adaptive if the alternative is to invest heavily in offspring which have a low probability of ever reproducing . Stressed females producing smaller , female - biased litters could still invest as much in each surviving male offspring as non - stressed females with larger litters . Huck et al . ( 1986 ) showed that females who were food restricted early in life produced reduced sex ratios but normal litter sizes when bred as adults . This suggests that early nutritional stress may influence lifetime reproductive potential via some other mechanism which allows facultative sex ratio modification without differential mortality in this species . It seems , however , that subordination stress during pregnancy has a more immediate effect on that particular litter , and that this effect involves the inflation of a pre - existing differential male mortality in this species .

Guilford & Dawkins ( 1987 ) have re - examined the search rate / search image hypotheses of animals searching for cryptic prey and highlighted two critical predictions which should distinguish between the two . The search rate hypothesis implies a general increase in detection accuracy and a predator is thought to learn to see cryptic prey by reducing its search rate . A predator that adopts a search image is thought to increase its detection accuracy by concentrating on a specific configu - ration of stimuli of a single prey type . The search rate hypothesis predicts ( 1 ) that learning to see one cryptic prey type will enhance the ability to detect other equally cryptic types ( the search image hypothesis predicts that this will interfere with the ability to detect other equally cryptic types ) ; and ( 2 ) that learning to see cryptic prey will be achieved by learning to spend longer looking at each patch of the environment . In my previous papers ( Lawrence 1985a , b ) I tested the search image hypothesis by calculating an indirect measure of how much time wild and captive European blackbirds , Turdus merula , spent looking at the background ( termed the residual search time ) . Guilford & Dawkins ( 1987 ) point out that a reduction in the average residual search time fails to exclude the search rate
