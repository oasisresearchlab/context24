Activation of T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) induces tyrosine phosphorylations that mediate the assembly of signaling protein complexes . Moreover , cholesterol - sphingolipid raft membrane domains have been implicated to play a role in TCR signal transduc - tion . Here , we studied the assembly of TCR with signal transduction proteins and raft markers in plasma mem - brane subdomains of Jurkat T leukemic cells . We em - ployed a novel method to immunoisolate plasma mem - brane subfragments that were highly concentrated in activated TCR – CD3 complexes and associated signal - ing proteins . We found that the raft transmembrane protein linker for activation of T cells ( LAT ) , but not a palmitoylation - deﬁcient non - raft LAT mutant , strongly accumulated in TCR - enriched immunoisolates in a ty - rosine phosphorylation – dependent manner . In con - trast , other raft - associated molecules , including protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn , GM1 , and cholesterol , were not highly concentrated in TCR - enriched plasma membrane immunoisolates . Many downstream signal - ing proteins coisolated with the TCR / LAT - enriched plasma membrane fragments , suggesting that LAT / TCR assemblies form a structural scaffold for TCR sig - nal transduction proteins . Our results indicate that TCR signaling assemblies in plasma membrane subdomains , rather than generally concentrating raft - associated membrane proteins and lipids , form by a selective pro - tein - mediated anchoring of the raft membrane protein LAT in vicinity of TCR . Key words : membrane protein assemblies • signal trans - duction • membrane rafts • palmitoylation • cholesterol Introduction The T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) 1 is activated by engage - ment with a cognate peptide – MHC complex expressed on the surface of an antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) . This trig - gers tyrosine phosphorylation cascades leading to a physi - ological response of activated T lymphocytes ( Weiss and Littman , 1994 ; Chan and Shaw , 1996 ; Wange and Samel - son , 1996 ) . After TCR / CD3 engagement , tyrosine - based activating motifs ( ITAMs ) of the CD3 - subunits and TCR z - chains become phosphorylated by Lck and , to lesser ex - tent , by Fyn protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) . PTK ZAP - 70 binds , via dual SH2 domains , to phosphorylated ITAMs ( Chan and Shaw , 1996 ) and phosphorylates the transmem - brane protein linker for activation of T cells ( LAT ; Zhang et al . , 1998a ) . LAT forms complexes with many signaling proteins ( for example GADs , Grb2 , and PLC - g 1 ) and , therefore , links TCR triggering to the Grb2 / SOS / ras path - way and the induction of Ca 2 1 fluxes ( Finco et al . , 1998 ; Zhang et al . , 1998a ; Zhang and Samelson , 2000 ) . In addition , a role of membrane microdomains ( rafts ) has been implicated in TCR signaling ( Horejsi et al . , 1999 ; Xavier and Seed , 1999 ; Ilangumaran et al . , 2000 ; Janes et al . , 2000 ) . Raft membrane domains are envisioned as lat - eral assemblies of sphingolipids and cholesterol that form liquid - ordered membrane phases ( Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ; Brown and London , 1998 ) . A detergent - resistant membrane fraction ( DRM ) is currently used to define rafts biochemically ( Parton and Simons , 1995 ; Brown and London , 1997 ) . After TCR stimulation phosphorylated TCR z - chain and cytoplasmic signaling proteins including Grb2 and PLC - g were shown to partition into DRMs ( Montixi et al . , 1998 ; Xavier et al . , 1998 ; but see also Zhang et al . , 1998b ; Janes et al . , 1999 ) . Src kinases Lck and Fyn and the linker protein LAT are recovered from DRMs independently of TCR triggering , suggesting that they are constitutively associated to raft membrane do - mains in T cells ( Zhang et al . , 1998b ; Resh , 1999 ) . DRM association of LAT and Lck depends on S - acylation , most probably by palmitic acid moieties , which are believed to Address correspondence to Thomas Harder , Basel Institute for Immunol - ogy , Grenzacherstrasse 287 , CH - 4005 , Basel , Switzerland .

Lck and LAT require membrane an - choring via palmitoylation to transduce TCR - elicited sig - nals ( Kabouridis et al . , 1997 ; Lin et al . , 1999 ; Zhang et al . , 1999 ) . Moreover , cross - linking of immunoreceptors like TCR and Fc e RI by soluble antibodies or multivalent anti - gens leads to the formation of patches that are in a highly ordered membrane phase and accumulate raft - associated molecules and signaling proteins ( Thomas et al . , 1994 ; Janes et al . , 1999 ; Sheets et al . , 1999b ) . Similar large stabi - lized raft patches form in Jurkat T leukemic cells by cross - linking the raft lipid ganglioside GM1 using choleratoxin B - subunit . These GM1 patches accumulate tyrosine - phos - phorylated proteins , LAT , Lck , as well as TCR / CD3 , sug - gesting that they form foci of TCR signal transduction ( Harder and Simons , 1999 ; Janes et al . , 1999 ) . Hence , it was proposed that coalescence of large raft domains in the vicinity of ligand – cross - linked TCR leads to activation by concentrating raft - associated signaling proteins while ex - cluding negatively regulating proteins such as the CD45 phosphatase ( for reviews see Horejsi et al . , 1999 ; Xavier and Seed , 1999 ; Janes et al . , 2000 ) . To specifically address the spatial organization of raft - associated signaling proteins in the plasma membrane ( PM ) environment of TCR , we employed a novel method to immunoisolate PM fragments highly enriched in acti - vated TCR . Analysis of the immunoisolates showed a se - lective accumulation of the raft - associated transmembrane protein LAT , but not a nonpalmitoylatable LAT variant , in the plasma membrane environment of TCR . In con - trast , other raft - associated molecules , including Lck / Fyn PTKs and glycosphingolipid GM1 , were not strongly con - centrated . Our findings indicate a selective protein - medi - ated formation of LAT - TCR signaling scaffolds and are counter to the view that raft lipid – mediated interactions stably couple raft - associated signaling proteins to acti - vated TCR . Materials and Methods Cells and Reagents Jurkat T leukemic cells were obtained from American Type Culture Col - lection ; ANJ3 and JCaM2 LAT – deficient Jurkat derivatives were pro - vided by Laurence Samelson ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) and Arthur Weiss ( University of California San Francisco [ UCSF ] , San Francisco , CA ) , respectively . Jurkat cells and their derivatives were grown in RPMI medium , 7 % FCS , penicillin ( 100 m g / ml ) / streptomycin ( 100 U / ml ) , and 2 mM glutamine ( all from GIBCO BRL ) at 37 8 C in 5 % CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere .

Immunoisolation of PM fragments M - 450 goat a - mouse magnetic beads ( Dynal ) were coated with TR66 a - CD3 mAb or B3 / 25 a - TfR mAb following the instructions of the manu - facturers . 1 – 4 3 10 7 Jurkat cells per data point were incubated with a - CD3 beads ( 1 : 2 ratio of beads / cells ) in 200 m l RPMI and 1 % FCS at 0 8 C for 2 min and subsequently pelleted with the beads at 2 , 000 rpm for 10 s at 4 8 C in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge . The bead – cell conjugates were incu - bated at 37 8 C for 0 , 3 , and 7 min , respectively . Cell conjugates were subse - quently washed once in H buffer ( 10 mM sodium Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 250 mM sucrose , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM NaF , and 1 mM vanadate ) and suspended in 1 ml H buffer containing CLAP protease inhibitors ( chymostatin , leupep - tin , antipain , and pepstatin [ Sigma Chemical Co . ] 100 m M each ) and 0 . 2 mM pervanadate . The cells were nitrogen - cavitated using a nitrogen cavi - tation bomb ( model 4639 ; Parr Instrument Company ) equilibrated at 4 8 C , 50 bar for 10 min . The homogenate was filled to 10 ml with H buffer , and the beads were subsequently retrieved with a magnet ( Dynal ) and washed three times in 10 ml of H buffer for 1 min each at 0 8 C . Homogenates were pelleted by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g at 4 8 C for 20 min in a TL100 table - top ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Coulter ) . Beads and cell pellets were ana - lyzed by Western blotting using ECL chemiluminescence ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . In some experiments , a nonreducing SDS - PAGE was used . ECL - exposed X - ray films were scanned and images were mounted using Adobe Photoshop™ software . For metabolic labeling , cells were kept for 16 h in low Met / Cys ( 1 . 5 mg / liter Met and 5 mg / liter Cys ) RPMI and 7 % FCS supplemented with 0 . 5 mCi / ml 35 S - Cys , 35 S - Met ( Promix ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Immunofluorescence and DiIC16 Loading For immunofluorescence analysis , Jurkat cell bead conjugates were ad - hered to poly - L - lysine ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) – coated microscope slides for 30 s and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temper - ature . Cells were permeabilized for 1 min in 0 . 1 % saponin in PBS at room temperature , blocked with PBS , 0 . 2 % BSA , and incubated with the anti - bodies diluted in PBS and 0 . 2 % BSA for 1 h at room temperature . After the antibody incubations , the cells were rinsed twice for 5 min in PBS , 0 . 2 % BSA and mounted in fluoromount G ( Southern Biotechnologies ) . For a - CD3 patching , 10 6 Jurkat cells were suspended and incubated in 100 m l RPMI , 10 mM Hepes ( RPMI - Hepes ) medium , pH 6 . 95 , at 4 8 C with 2 m g / ml TR66 a - CD3 mAb . Subsequently , cells were washed twice and in - cubated in 100 m l RPMI - Hepes with 5 m g / ml FITC - conjugated goat a - rab - bit at 37 8 C for 5 min . DiIC16 labeling of Jurkat cells was performed as described previously for RBL 2H3 cells ( Thomas et al . , 1994 ) . In brief , 5 3 10 6 cells were washed twice and suspended in 1 ml RPMI - Hepes . 4 m l of a 1 mg / ml DiIC16 ( Molecular Probes ) methanolic stock solution was added and the suspension was rapidly mixed . After washing in RPMI - Hepes , DiIC16 - labeled cells were conjugated to Ab - coated beads , incubated at 37 8 C for 7 min , plated on poly - L - lysine – coated coverslips and directly inspected us - ing rhodamine optics . Epifluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope . Digital images were obtained using a 12 - bit Hamamatsu C4742 - 95 CCD camera . Images were mounted using Openlab™ ( Improvision ) and Adobe Photoshop™ software . [ 3 H ] Cholesterol Labeling of Cells and Cholesterol Depletion 2 3 10 7 cells were washed in serum - free RPMI and incubated for 3 h at 37 8 C in 20 ml of serum - free RPMI with 85 m Ci 1 a , 2 a [ 3 H ] cholesterol ( 47 Ci / mmol ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) and added 1 : 200 as an ethanolic solution . Subsequently , cells were washed in RPMI 7 % FCS and incu - bated for 16 h at 37 8 C in full medium . 3 H radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using a 200CA Packard liquid scintillation an - alyzer . Before extraction with methyl b cyclodextrin ( M b CD ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) , the Jurkat cells were washed twice with RPMI - Hepes and 1 mg / ml BSA . 10 7 cells / ml were extracted with 10 mM and 4 mM M b CD for the in - dicated times in RPMI - Hepes and 1 mg / ml BSA at 37 8 C on a rocking plat - form . Viability of the cells was tested by trypan blue ( GIBCO BRL ) ex - clusion . The extent of cholesterol depletion was measured using [ 3 H ] cholesterol - labeled Jurkat cells and expressed as mean 6 SD from three measurements . Harder and Kuhn TCR - LAT Signaling Assemblies in Membrane Subdomains 201 Transfection and Generation of Stable JCaM2 Cell Lines LAT expression constructs in pcdef3 for wt LAT , Lck - LAT , and C26 / 29S LAT were provided by Joseph Lin and Arthur Weiss ( UCSF , San Fran - cisco , CA ) . The plasmids were purified using a QIAGEN column and lin - earized with ScaI . 1 . 8 3 10 7 JCaM2 cells were electroporated at 250V , 960 m F with 50 m g of the respective plasmid DNA in PBS , 2 mM ATP , 5 mM reduced glutathione ( both Fluka ) in 0 . 4 - cm cuvettes using a Gene pulser™ electroporation device ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Resistant clones were selected in 96 - well plates ( 10 , 000 cells / well ) in full medium contain - ing 2 mg / ml G418 ( GIBCO BRL ) . Clones with equal LAT and CD3 sur - face expression , which was determined by FACS analysis , were chosen for subsequent analysis . PP2 Treatments and Biotinylation 1 . 5 3 10 7 Jurkat cells were washed once in RPMI - Hepes and treated with PP2 ( 100 m M ; 1 : 350 dilution from stock in DMSO ; Calbiochem ) at 37 8 C for 1 h in 1 . 4 ml serum - free RPMI - Hepes medium . 5 3 10 6 cells per data point were used for immunoisolation . Jurkat cells were biotinylated in PBS 2 1 ( PBS , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM KCl , and 2 mM MgCl 2 ) at 4 8 C using 0 . 5 mg / ml Sulfo - NHS - biotin ( Pierce Chem - ical Co . ) for 30 min at 4 8 C following the instructions of the manufacturer . PM was detected using HRP - avidin ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) by Western blot analysis and ECL detection ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) follow - ing the instructions of the manufacturer . Detergent - insoluble Membrane Fractions 2 3 10 7 cyclodextrin - or mock - treated Jurkat cells were homogenized in 300 m l ice - cold HNE ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , and 5 mM EDTA ) and 1 % Triton X - 100 by passage through a 22G syringe and incu - bated for 15 min on ice . The extract , adjusted to 40 % Optiprep™ ( Ny - comed Pharma ) , was transferred to an SW55 centrifuge tube ( Beckman Coulter ) and overlaid with 1 ml of 35 , 30 , 25 , and 0 % Optiprep in HNE , and 1 % Triton X - 100 . The gradients were spun at 40 , 000 rpm for 7 h at 4 8 C . 600 - m l fractions were TCA - precipitated and analyzed by Western blotting . Results We developed an immunoisolation procedure for PM sub - fragments that are highly enriched in activated TCR and associated signaling proteins . Molecular analysis of these immunoisolates served as an assay for the accumulation of signaling molecules in the vicinity of activated TCR . Enrichment of TCR and Signaling Proteins in TCR / CD3 Immunoisolates To define PM fragments enriched in activated TCR , we formed conjugates between a - CD3 antibody – coated mag - netic beads and Jurkat cells at 0 8 C . These were warmed to 37 8 C for 0 , 3 , and 7 min , inducing TCR signaling as de - scribed previously ( Hashemi et al . , 1996 ; Lowin - Kropf et al . , 1998 ) . Subsequently , the conjugates were homoge - nized using nitrogen cavitation , and the beads were re - trieved and washed . The immunoisolated membrane frag - ments bound to the antibody - coated beads were analyzed biochemically ( Fig . 1 ) . Western blot analysis showed a strong accumulation of TCR z - chain ( and CD3 e ; data not shown ) in the immu - noisolates in the course of the incubation at 37 8 C ( Fig . 1 ) , possibly reflecting an active transport of TCR to the bead – cell interface or increased mobility of TCR in the PM at 37 8 C . Very low amounts of TCR and signaling proteins were recovered at 0 8 C incubation , showing that the amount of TCR that binds to a - CD3 beads after homogenization is negligible . Approximately 1 / 10 of the TCR z - chain present in the 100 , 000 - g – pelleted homogenate was recovered after a 7 - min incubation ( Fig . 1 ) . We determined an z 50 - fold enrichment of TCR z - chain over protein of the 100 , 000 - g homogenate pellet ( Table I ) . Importantly , the raft - associ - ated transmembrane protein LAT was equally strongly enriched in the immunoisolates as TCR z - chain . Other TCR signaling proteins are enriched in immunoisolates , most probably as a consequence of binding to TCR and LAT . Accordingly , the enrichment of ZAP - 70 is due to its association to phosphorylated ITAMs in the TCR com - plex ( Chan and Shaw , 1996 ) . A strong representation of Shc and Cbl may be caused by interaction with CD3 / TCR subunits and ZAP - 70 , respectively ( Ravichandran et al . , 1993 ; Fournel et al . , 1996 ; van Leeuwen and Samelson , Figure 1 .

Protein amounts were determined by measuring sulfur - 35 metabolically labeled protein . Recovery of cholesterol was determined by [ 3 H ] cholesterol labeling of the cells . The amount of TCR / LAT and biotinylated cell surface recovered in the immunoisolates was estimated by comparison with dilutions of the total homogenate ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Each determination was repeated at least three times . Cholesterol yields are determined from six measurements each . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 151 , 2000 202 1999 ) . In addition , we observed a strong enrichment of sig - naling molecules PLC - g and Grb2 , which both bind to phosphorylated LAT ( Zhang et al . , 1998a ) . Thus , LAT co - enriches with TCR in the a - CD3 immunoisolates together with the signaling proteins involved in TCR - evoked re - sponses such as ras activation and induction of Ca 2 1 fluxes . In contrast to the raft - transmembrane protein LAT , raft - associated Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases as well as Ha - ras did not appear in high amounts in the isolated TCR signal - ing complexes . Likewise , SLP - 76 as well as the p85 regula - tory subunit of PI3 kinase , both recovered from immuno - precipitations of LAT from detergent - solubilized cells ( Zhang et al . , 1998a ) , were not highly enriched in the im - munoisolated membrane fractions . LAT Is Specifically Concentrated in a - CD3 – immunoisolated Plasma Membrane Fragments LAT and TCR are enriched z 50 - fold over total pelletable protein in the a - CD3 immunoisolated PM fragments ( Ta - ble I ) . Next , we tested whether they specifically accumu - late in the a - CD3 isolated PM fragments . As a measure for PM recovery , we used biotinylated cell surface probed on a Western blot with avidin - HRP ( Fig . 2 ) . a - Transferrin re - ceptor ( TfR ) antibody – coated beads were employed to isolate control PM fragments . The a - TfR beads did not elicit Ca 2 1 fluxes , whereas a - CD3 beads efficiently trig - gered a sustained rise in intracellular Ca 2 1 ( data not shown ) . The amounts of PM retrieved by a - CD3 and a - TfR beads after different times of incubation at 37 8 C were sim - ilar , corresponding to 1 – 2 % of the total biotinylated cell surface ( Fig . 2 , Table I ) . As expected , TfR was enriched in a - TfR bead isolates . The presence of TfR in the a - CD3 isolates indicates a background that corresponded to the amount of isolated PM . Likewise , the a - TfR beads con - tained background amounts of LAT . However , the amounts of LAT , PLC - g , and Grb2 in a - CD3 immunoiso - lates was much higher , demonstrating that these proteins specifically accumulate in a - CD3 – immunoisolated PM fragments together with the TCR z - chain . In contrast , a - CD3 , a - TfR immunoisolates , and dilutions of cell ho - mogenate , normalized to comparable amounts of PM , contained similar amounts of Lck and of Fyn ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus , Lck and Fyn were not detectably concentrated in the a - CD3 immunoisolated PM fragments . Next , we as - sayed recovery of raft glycolipid GM1 and cholesterol in the immunoisolates using an overlay with the choleratoxin B subunit or [ 3 H ] cholesterol - labeled cells , respectively . Neither GM1 nor cholesterol significantly accumulated in PM fragments immunoisolated with a - CD3 beads ( Fig . 2 and Table I ) . Moreover , we did not detect an enrichment of GPI - anchored proteins using an overlay with the GPI probe bacterial toxin proaerolysin ( data not shown ; Abrami et al . , 1998 ) . The biochemical analysis was complemented by fluores - cence microscopy of bead – cell conjugates ( Fig . 3 ) . Immu - nofluorescence microscopy showed a specific LAT accu - mulation at the a - CD3 bead – cell contact area ( Fig . 3 A , arrows ) but not at the a - TfR control beads . In contrast , Lck was not specifically concentrated in the PM region contacting a - CD3 beads ( Fig . 3 C ) . Increased Lck staining was visible in membrane ruffles and microvilli forming at the cell pole facing the a - CD3 bead ( Fig . 3 C , arrows ) . This strongly supports our biochemical data that Lck is , if at all , only weakly concentrated in the PM region contact - ing the TCR activating beads . The fluorescent lipid dye DiIC16 preferentially parti - tions into membrane domains in a highly ordered lipid state , which form in patches of Fc e RI IgE receptor cross - linked by soluble antigen ( Thomas et al . , 1994 ) . Therefore , we followed the distribution of DiIC16 lipid dye in a - CD3 and a - TfR bead – cell conjugates by fluorescence micros - copy . DiIC16 staining was neither detectably increased nor excluded in the Jurkat PM in contact with a - CD3 beads or a - TfR beads ( Fig . 3 , E and F ) , whereas antibody – cross - linked TCR clusters were strongly labeled with DiIC16 ( Fig . 3 , G and H ) . The PM fragments recovered by the beads are shown in Fig . 3 ( E and F ) and are z 0 . 5 – 1 m M in size . Taken together , these data show that a - CD3 beads do not generate large raft - like patches in the PM re - sembling those that form upon cross - linking of Fc e RI and TCR using soluble antigens or antibodies , respectively . Accumulation of LAT in TCR PM Environment Depends on Tyrosine Phosphorylation We examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation by Lck / Fyn is required for accumulation of LAT and signaling proteins in the TCR vicinity . We performed a - CD3 immu - noisolation using Jurkat cells treated with PP2 , a specific and potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn ( Fig . 4 ; Hanke et al . , 1996 ) . This treatment had little effect on the enrichment of TCR z - chain in the immu - Figure 2 .

Recovery of biotinylated cell surface was monitored by Western blot with HRP - avidin . 1 : 100 ( A ) and 1 : 50 ( B ) dilutions of pel - leted homogenate were loaded . The positions of molecular mass markers ( in kilodaltons ) are shown . Closed circles mark the posi - tion of the Ab light chain . Harder and Kuhn TCR - LAT Signaling Assemblies in Membrane Subdomains 203 noisolates . However , recovery of LAT as well as other sig - naling proteins , ZAP - 70 , Grb2 , and PLC - g , was strongly inhibited . Thus , accumulation of LAT and other signaling proteins in the a - CD3 immunoisolates depended on ty - rosine phosphorylations mediated by the PTKs Lck / Fyn . LAT Requires Palmitoylation To Be Anchored in the TCR Environment Next , we tested whether LAT requires raft association for its accumulation in the TCR microenvironment . We used the LAT - deficient Jurkat derivative ANJ3 cells either re - constituted with wild - type LAT or with LAT lacking palmitoylation sites , i . e . , a non - raft LAT mutant ( Fig . 5 A ; Zhang et al . , 1998b ; Lin et al . , 1999 ) . a - CD3 immunoiso - lates from ANJ3 contained TCR z - chain , albeit at a re - duced immunoisolation efficiency , but lacked LAT and as - sociated PLC - g and Grb2 . Importantly , LAT , PLC - g , and Grb2 were efficiently coisolated in a - CD3 – immunoiso - lated PM from wt LAT - reconstituted ANJ3 cells . In con - trast , a LAT variant mutated in the S - palmitoylation sites Cys 26 and Cys 29 was not recruited into the a - CD3 iso - lates and failed to reconstitute PLC - g and Grb2 recruit - ment into a - CD3 immunoisolates . Palmitoylation - defi - cient LAT mutant as well as wild - type LAT are both located in the PM ( Zhang et al . , 1998b ) . Thus , in addi - tion to Lck / Fyn tyrosine kinase activity , LAT requires palmitoylation for its accumulation in the vicinity of trig - gered TCR . Lck is anchored in the inner leaflet of the PM via an NH 2 - terminal myristoyl group and dual S - acylation , whereas LAT has a transmembrane domain and two S - acylation sites . It is possible that these different modes of raft anchoring cause the distinct behavior of Lck and LAT in our immunoisolation experiments . Therefore , we Figure 3 .

Assembly of TCR signaling complexes depends on Lck / Fyn activity . Control cells or cells treated with specific Lck / Fyn inhibitor PP2 were conjugated with a - CD3 beads . After incuba - tion at 0 , 3 , and 7 min , a - CD3 immunoisolation was performed as described , and the isolates were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against the indicated proteins . Asterisks mark the po - sition of heavy chain ; closed circles mark the position of the light chain of the antibody used for the immunoisolation . The posi - tions of molecular mass markers ( in kilodaltons ) are shown . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 151 , 2000 204 tested whether a Lck - LAT chimera that is anchored in the PM via Lck’s NH 2 - terminal membrane region ( Lin et al . , 1999 ) concentrates like wt LAT in a - CD3 immunoisolates ( Fig . 5 B ) . Starting from the JCaM2 Jurkat derivative that , like ANJ3 cells , essentially lacks LAT expression ( Finco et al . , 1998 ) , we generated stable cell lines that express wt LAT and a LAT mutant that harbors the NH 2 - terminal membrane – anchoring domain of Lck ( Lin et al . , 1999 ) . We found that the LAT construct with an Lck anchor was equally strongly enriched in a - CD3 immunoisolates as WT LAT . Immunoisolation efficiencies from JCaM2 and ANJ3 cells that did not express signaling - competent LAT were slightly reduced , as indicated by the lower TCR z - chain recovery . However , the reduction of LAT mutants and signaling proteins in immunoisolates from these cells is much more pronounced and , therefore , is not caused by the slightly reduced efficiency of immunoisolation . Taken together , our results show that the different behavior of Lck and LAT in our experiments are not caused by their distinct raft anchors but are functions of their respective cytoplasmic domains . Effects of Cholesterol Depletion on a - CD3 Immunoisolations Disruption of raft domains using cholesterol depletion has been used to study the role of raft domains in TCR signal - ing ( Xavier et al . , 1998 ; Kabouridis et al . , 2000 ) . Impor - tantly , Kabouridis et al . ( 2000 ) showed that cholesterol de - pletion of Jurkat cells with 10 mM M b CD abrogated DRM association of Lck and LAT within the first 20 min of ex - traction and , in parallel , stimulated tyrosine phosphoryla - tions and the ras pathway ( Kabouridis et al . , 2000 ) . There - fore , we studied the effects of these cholesterol depletion conditions on the recovery of TCR signaling proteins in our immunoisolation procedure . Extraction with 10 mM Figure 5 . ( A ) TCR - LAT assembly formation requires palmitoy - lation of LAT . LAT - deficient ANJ3 cells and ANJ3 cells recon - stituted with WT or palmitoylation - deficient C26 / 29A LAT were used for a - CD3 immunoisolation .

Harder and Kuhn TCR - LAT Signaling Assemblies in Membrane Subdomains 205 M b CD for 20 min reduced the amount of cholesterol in Jur - kat cells to 35 6 2 % SD of the control value . Moreover , it strongly reduced DRM association of Lck and LAT in Tri - ton X - 100 Jurkat lysates , suggesting a reduction of raft as - sociation ( Fig . 6 A ) . Interestingly , the a - CD3 immunoiso - lates of Jurkat cells treated for 20 min with 10 mM M b CD contained the same set of tyrosine - phosphorylated signal - ing proteins as the isolates from the control cells . Indeed , the recovery of TCR - LAT signaling assemblies from these cells was slightly enhanced ( Fig . 6 B ) . This showed that TCR signaling protein assemblies form after M b CD ex - traction when raft domains are disrupted but tyrosine phosphorylations are increased and deregulated . This strongly supports the view that LAT - TCR assemblies are stably connected via tyrosine phosphorylation – dependent protein – protein interactions and are not coupled by cho - lesterol - dependent raft lipid domains . Extraction with 10 mM M b CD for longer than 30 min resulted in significant cell death during conjugate forma - tion and incubation at 37 8 C . Therefore , we tested lower M b CD concentrations and extended the extraction times . We found that depletion with 4 mM M b CD for 40 min re - duced the cholesterol to 45 6 4 % SD and led to reduced DRM association of Lck and LAT ( Fig . 6 A ) . Jurkat cells , extracted under these conditions , are viable and fully re - cover in medium containing 10 % FCS . Retrieval of TCR and signaling proteins in the a - CD3 immunoisolates from cells treated with 4 mM M b CD for 40 min was clearly re - duced . The tyrosine - phosphorylated p23 form of TCR z - chain tyrosine phosphorylation was relatively reduced over the less phosphorylated p21 form . We also observed a strong reduction of ZAP - 70 amounts in the isolates , which is consistent with an inhibition of TCR z ITAMs phos - phorylation and reduced recruitment of ZAP - 70 . A shorter ( 20 min ) extraction with 4 mM M b CD had little effect on the recovery of signaling proteins in a - CD3 immunoiso - lates ( not shown ) . Therefore , an inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation was observable only after longer choles - terol extraction times . Using our novel immunoisolation procedure , we de - scribe signaling protein assemblies in TCR - enriched PM subdomains . These assemblies accumulated the raft - associ - ated transmembrane protein LAT and signaling proteins , including ZAP - 70 , Grb2 , PLC - g , and Shc , which mediate and regulate biochemical reactions leading to TCR - evoked signal transduction ( Wange and Samelson , 1996 ; van Leeu - wen and Samelson , 1999 ) . In contrast , we did not detect an accumulation of other raft - associated markers tested , in - cluding Lck / Fyn tyrosine kinases , raft - lipid GM1 , and cho - lesterol and raft DiIC16 lipid dye showing a selective en - richment of LAT over other raft - associated molecules . Discussion To define the role of raft membrane domains in TCR sig - naling , it is important to understand how rafts , raft - associ - ated signal transduction proteins , and TCR are spatially organized in the plane of the plasma membrane . We ad - dressed this question using a novel immunoisolation proce - dure for PM subdomains highly enriched in activated TCR complexes . By this approach , we found that the raft - associ - ated transmembrane linker protein LAT selectively accu - mulated in the membrane environment of activated TCR , whereas other raft markers were not detectably concen - trated . Taken together , our observations question the view that assemblies of membrane proteins involved in TCR signaling form by coalescence of raft domains and strongly indicate that protein - mediated interactions mediate a se - lective accumulation of the raft - associated membrane pro - tein LAT in the PM environment of activated TCR . Protein - and Raft Lipid – mediated Interactions in TCR - LAT Assembly We found that selective LAT accumulation in TCR - enriched PM immunoisolates required tyrosine phos - phorylations and , therefore , is most likely mediated by protein – protein interactions . This raft lipid – independent element of TCR - LAT assembly is corroborated by choles - terol depletion experiments . Using the cholesterol extrac - tion conditions described by Kabouridis et al . ( 2000 ) , at which DRM association of LAT and Lck were abolished but tyrosine phosphorylations were strongly induced , LAT was efficiently recovered in TCR - enriched immunoiso - lates . The molecular mechanism of LAT accumulation in TCR’s PM environment is currently under investigation . Possibly , LAT becomes laterally cross - linked by signaling molecules and / or it is anchored by interaction with cyto - skeletal elements . Moreover , we show that a nonpalmitoylatable LAT mu - tant does not accumulate in the PM environment of TCR , suggesting the importance of LAT’s raft association in the formation of TCR - LAT assemblies . Importantly , raft - tar - geting sequences of Lck are sufficient for mediating an ac - cumulation of LAT in the membrane environment of TCR . This enforces the view that the distinct behavior of Lck and LAT in our immunoisolation experiments is not due to their different raft - membrane anchor but is a func - tion of their cytoplasmic domains . This is in line with the finding that LAT requires membrane anchoring via S - palmitoylations for its ability to transduce TCR - evoked signals ( Zhang et al . , 1998b , 1999 ; Lin et al . , 1999 ) . It is possible that S - palmitoylation and raft targeting of LAT is directly required for its interaction with the TCR environment . Similar to our observations for LAT – TCR interactions , the association of Fyn with TCR z - chain ITAMs required , in addition to Fyn’s acylations , SH2 do - main – phosphotyrosine interactions ( van’t Hof and Resh , 1999 ) . These findings as well as our observations may be explained by relatively transient palmitoylation - depen - dent encounters with TCR or TCR - associated targets , fol - lowed by phosphorylation - dependent protein - mediated stabilization . Alternatively , it is possible that LAT does not directly require S - palmitoylation for its interaction with TCR but for an interaction with another raft - associ - ated regulatory protein or for the formation of LAT homo - oligomers . Last , the involvement of an adaptor pro - tein that specifically interacts with S - palmitoyl groups can - not be excluded . Tyrosine phosphorylation induced by cholesterol deple - tion ( Kabouridis et al . , 2000 ) as well as the efficient immu - noisolation of TCR / LAT signaling assemblies from cho - lesterol - depleted cells , described here , suggest a negative regulatory role of raft domains . Possibly , the segregation The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 151 , 2000 206 of nonengaged TCR and raft - associated signaling proteins in distinct membrane phases suppress tyrosine phosphory - lations and signaling . Enrichment of Signaling Proteins in a - CD3 Immunoisolates Enrichment of cytoplasmic signaling proteins ZAP - 70 , grb2 , and PLC - g in our a - CD3 immunoisolates indicate the formation signaling protein complexes around a scaf - fold of TCR - LAT . Surprisingly , some proteins that have been recovered from immunoprecipitations of LAT , such as SLP - 76 and p85 PI3 kinase subunit ( Zhang et al . , 1998a ) , were not detectably enriched in our a - CD3 immu - noisolates . It is possible that these proteins interact with LAT molecules that are not part of TCR - LAT assemblies isolated here . Moreover , protein complexes of low stoichi - ometry may not be detectable as enrichment in our immu - noisolates . This may occur when signaling proteins com - pete for binding sites in the isolates . For example binding of Fyn , via its SH2 domains , to phosphorylated TCR z - chain ITAMs of the TCR complex ( van’t Hof and Resh , 1999 ) may be reduced by the occupation of these ITAMs by ZAP - 70 . Last , it cannot be excluded that some cytoplas - mic proteins , which may , for example , be anchored to the actin cytoskeleton , are selectively shorn from the signaling complexes during the homogenization procedure . Structure of Membrane Domains Generated by Soluble Ligand and a - CD3 Beads We showed that Jurkat PM domains bound by a - CD3 – coated dynabeads do not strongly accumulate raft lipid dye DiIC16 and , except for LAT , other raft markers . In contrast , high affinity IgE receptor Fc e RI and TCR , cross - linked by soluble multivalent ligands , formed membrane patches in a highly ordered phase that accumulate DiIC16 and raft - associated PTKs ( Thomas et al . , 1994 ; Janes et al . , 1999 ; Sheets et al . , 1999a ; and this study ) . This difference could be due to higher densities of TCR or Fc e RI in clus - ters formed by soluble oligomeric ligands leading to the formation of large continuous patches of highly ordered membrane domains that concentrate raft markers . It is im - portant to note that a low level of oligomerization into dimers or trimers is a sufficient stimulus for TCR signaling ( Boniface et al . , 1998 ; Cochran et al . , 2000 ) . Moreover , un - der physiological conditions , the number of cognate pep - tide – MHC ligands for TCR on an APC is low ( 10 – 100 / APC ; Germain , 1997 ) . Therefore , the formation of mi - crometer scale patches of cross - linked TCR are unlikely to be required for TCR triggering . Raft Involvement in T Cell Activation : Accessory Molecular Interactions LAT and Lck associate with CD4 and CD8 T cell corecep - tors for MHC ( Weiss and Littman , 1994 ; Bosselut et al . , 1999 ) and are , thus , concentrated in the proximity of MHC - engaged TCR . However , this CD4 or CD8 - medi - ated concentration is not required for TCR triggering and T cell activation using a - CD3 antibodies or potent pep - tide – MHC complexes ( Viola et al . , 1997 ) . Raft may also be involved in CD4 / CD8 function as suggested by their DRM association ( Cerny et al . , 1996 ; Parolini et al . , 1996 ; Xavier et al . , 1998 ; Horejsi et al . , 1999 ; Millan et al . , 1999 ) . Moreover , CD8 b is palmitoylated and this is required for its targeting to DRMs and for the association of the CD8 complex with Lck ( Arcaro et al . , 2000 ) . T cell activation is supported by coengagement of raft molecules in the contact zone between a T cell and an APC or TCR - activating beads ( Moran and Miceli , 1998 ; Leyton et al . , 1999 ; Viola et al . , 1999 ) . Moreover raft lipid GM1 was shown to polarize towards beads coated with TCR and CD28 - activating antibody ( Viola et al . , 1999 ) , possibly mediated by an actin / myosin - mediated plasma membrane transport that , likewise , depends on CD28 co - stimulation ( Wülfing and Davis , 1998 ) . Formation of larger raft - like membrane domains may be required for sustained TCR signaling and the activation of resting T lymphocytes . Likewise , the formation of defined of plasma membrane domains in the immunological synapse at the APC / T cell contact zone may support compartmentalizing principles required for T cell activation ( Monks et al . , 1998 ; Grakoui et al . , 1999 ; van der Merwe et al . , 2000 ) . However , the relationship of these membrane domains and liquid - ordered raft membrane phases remain to be to defined . Our observations point to the important role of protein – protein interactions in the formation of TCR - LAT signal - ing assemblies . Using our novel approach it will be inter - esting to analyze how signaling proteins assemble into multimolecular complexes and to define how their struc - ture links to TCR signaling . Moreover , our results indicate that the role of raft domains may go beyond the formation of TCR signaling platforms . The key challenge is to under - stand how rafts behave upon TCR engagement and how potentially highly dynamic raft lipid – dependent interac - tions control TCR signal transduction .
