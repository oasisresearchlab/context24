Elings Digital Instruments , Santa Barbara , California 93117 (cid:126) Received 22 October 1997 ; accepted for publication 13 March 1998 (cid:33) A method is presented to measure the energy dissipated by the tip – sample interaction in tapping - mode atomic force microscopy (cid:126) AFM (cid:33) . The results show that if the amplitude of the cantilever is held constant , the sine of the phase angle of the driven vibration is then proportional to changes in the tip – sample energy dissipation . This means that images of the cantilever phase in tapping - mode AFM are closely related to maps of dissipation . The maximum dissipation observed for a 4 N / m cantilever with an initial amplitude of 25 nm tapping on a hard substrate at 74 kHz is about 0 . 3 pW . © 1998 American Institute of Physics . (cid:64) S0003 - 6951 (cid:126) 98 (cid:33) 01620 - 9 (cid:35) Students of classical dynamics are taught that there are often two ways to study a mechanical system : through forces or energy . Considering the name of the ﬁeld , it is not sur - prising that in atomic force microscopy (cid:126) AFM (cid:33) the dominant viewpoint has always been the Newtonian one . There has been much interest in imaging material properties by mea - suring the phase of a tapping cantilever relative to the drive , 1 – 4 and recent modeling of tapping - mode AFM 5 has all centered on writing down a force - based equation of motion for the cantilever that includes nonlinear terms to account for the tip – sample interaction and then solving the differential equation (cid:126) usually numerically (cid:33) . See Refs . 6 – 11 for some re - cent work in this area . In this letter , we show that by taking advantage of the observed steady - state motion of the canti - lever and calculating the energy inputs and outputs , the phase of the oscillating cantilever can be directly related to the energy loss in the tip – sample junction , and a numerical value for the power being lost can be extracted . Our interest in the energy viewpoint came about because of a few surprises in some computer modeling of tapping - mode AFM done by one of the authors and co - workers . 6 , 12 The model qualitatively reproduced several of the features seen in experimental amplitude and phase versus distance curves even though the only energy loss in the model corre - sponded to air damping of the body of the cantilever . Also , like the experimental data (cid:126) Fig . 1 (cid:33) , the steady - state solution of the tapping cantilever was nearly sinusoidal 13 even though a (cid:126) conservative (cid:33) highly nonlinear force dependence was in - troduced to model the tip – sample interaction . This led us to analyze the role energy dissipation plays in tapping - mode AFM and to the realization that the energy inputs and out - puts can be easily accounted for as long as the motion stays nearly sinusoidal . In equilibrium the average rate at which energy is fed into the cantilever must equal the average rate at which en - ergy is dissipated by the cantilever and the tip . It is conve - nient to break the dissipated power into two pieces , so that P in (cid:53) P 0 (cid:49) P tip . The ﬁrst piece of the dissipated power P 0 , can be thought of as ‘‘background’’ dissipation that is present but that we are not interested in directly . In most cases , P 0 covers power dissipated by the body of the canti - lever (cid:126) e . g . , air damping (cid:33) and is well modeled by simple vis - cous damping , while P tip includes sources of dissipation lo - calized to a small volume including the tip and sample . We ﬁrst calculate the input power , P in term for a canti - lever with spring constant k whose base position z d ( t ) is driven sinusoidally with amplitude A d and a frequency (cid:118) . Assuming a sinusoidal steady - state response , the deﬂection from equilibrium of the end of the cantilever , z ( t ) , can be written as A cos ( (cid:118) t (cid:49) (cid:119) ) where A is the amplitude of the cantilever and (cid:119) is the phase of the cantilever relative to the driver . The instantaneous power delivered by the driver is the force on the driver times the velocity of the driver : 14 P in (cid:53) Fz˙ d (cid:53) k (cid:64) z ( t ) (cid:50) z d ( t ) (cid:35) z˙ d . Integrating over a complete cycle , the average power yields P in (cid:53) 12 kA d A (cid:118) sin (cid:119) . (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) This contains the familiar result that the maximum power is delivered to an oscillator when the response is 90° out of phase with the drive . Now let us address the power leaving the cantilever . Assuming that the background dissipation P 0 is well mod - eled by viscous damping of the cantilever body , F damping (cid:53) bz˙ , a similar analysis yields the average background power P 0 (cid:53) 12 bA 2 (cid:118) 2 . (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) We can now solve for the power dissipated by the tip , since experimentally , it is easiest to measure b by measuring the cantilever spring constant k , and then measuring the quality factor Q cant and natural resonant frequency (cid:118) 0 from the shape and frequency of the free - cantilever resonance , we use Q cant (cid:53) k / b (cid:118) 0 to get P tip (cid:53) 1 2 kA 2 (cid:118) Q cant (cid:70) Q cant A d sin (cid:119) A (cid:50) (cid:118) (cid:118) 0 (cid:71) . (cid:126) 3 (cid:33) Note that the reason that Q cant and (cid:118) 0 appear in Eq . (cid:126) 3 (cid:33) is to express the viscous damping coefﬁcient b in terms of experi - mentally accessible quantities . Equation (cid:126) 3 (cid:33) does not imply that the resonant frequency or Q of the interacting cantilever remains the same , it only assumes that the viscous damping coefﬁcient describing the damping of the body of the lever remains unchanged . a (cid:33) Electronic mail : jc @ di . com b (cid:33) Also at Physikalisches Institut , Universita¨t Mu¨nster , D - 48149 Mu¨nster , Germany . c (cid:33) Also at Polymer Technology , ETH Zu ¨ rich , 8092 Zu ¨ rich , Switzerland .

In this case , further simpliﬁcation occurs because we can deﬁne the free amplitude of the cantilever as A 0 (cid:53) Q cant A d (cid:126) this is true even for Q cant (cid:44) 1 (cid:33) , yielding P tip (cid:53) 1 2 kA 2 (cid:118) 0 Q cant (cid:70) (cid:83) A 0 A (cid:68) sin (cid:119) (cid:50) 1 (cid:71) . (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) The computer model provided a speciﬁc case in which expression (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) could be veriﬁed . Since the modeled tip – sample interaction was conservative (cid:126) i . e . , P tip (cid:53) 0 (cid:33) , the ex - pression in square brackets in Eq . (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) was expected to be zero , or equivalently (cid:119) (cid:53) arcsin ( A / A 0 ) . This relationship was well obeyed in the modeling data . One of the most important consequences of Eq . (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) is that , if the tip loses no energy , then the amplitude and the phase are not independent . Experimentally , phase imaging is performed with the amplitude held constant by a feedback loop , so it is only when the tip – sample interaction losses vary that phase contrast will be observed . Some recent mod - eling by our group 15 and by Tamayo and Garcia 16 agrees with this . The one exception in which phase contrast is not due to dissipation arises because it is the sin (cid:119) rather than (cid:119) itself that appears in Eq . (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) . Since sine is a symmetric func - tion about 90° , phase changes symmetric about 90° are al - lowed even if there are no losses in the tip – sample interac - tion . Such symmetric jumps from attractive ( (cid:46) 90° ) to repulsive phases ( (cid:44) 90° ) are observed in the modeling data when conservative tip – sample interactions are used . 6 , 16 In standard phase imaging , the phase angle is plotted , so phase contrast observed where the phase jumps from attractive phases to repulsive phases is not due to dissipation , but is instead due to competition between the attractive and repul - sive forces . Equation (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) tells us how we can interpret phase images taken on resonance at constant amplitude . The sin (cid:119) is sim - ply proportional to the power being lost by the tip plus a constant . As long as the phase stays on one side of 90° (cid:126) the microscope is always operating in the attractive or the repul - sive regime (cid:33) , then any changes in the phase image are di - rectly due to changes in the energy being dissipated in the tip – sample junction . In fact , if a few parameters are mea - sured , a phase image can be directly converted into a quan - titative image of dissipation . We used expression (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) to evaluate the energy dissipated by a 225 (cid:109) m silicon cantilever 17 tapping on a silicon wafer in ambient conditions . The k , Q cant , and (cid:118) 0 (cid:126) 4 . 0 N / m , 130 , and 2 (cid:112) (cid:149) 73881 Hz (cid:33) of the ‘‘free’’ cantilever were evaluated by measuring and ﬁtting the thermal noise . 18 , 19 Ideally , k is measured far enough from the sample that there is no inter - action and Q cant is measured close enough to include squeeze ﬁlm damping effects . 20 Then , amplitude and phase versus distance curves were recorded (cid:126) Fig . 1 (cid:33) and Eq . (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) was used to calculate the power being dissipated . There are a couple of features of Fig . 2 (cid:126) c (cid:33) that are im - mediately interesting . One is the maximum power dissipated of about 0 . 3 pW . This corresponds to about 25 eV per tap of the cantilever . Although this is sufﬁcient energy to break several covalent bonds , if the contact area is just a few na - nometers across , the energy per atom becomes a fraction of an electron volt , explaining the ability of tapping - mode AFM to image many samples nondestructively . The other is the fact that in the repulsive phase region the energy dissipation is independent of sample position (cid:126) i . e . , amplitude (cid:33) . This is consistent with the modeling , which showed that the peak force on the sample was fairly constant after the transition to repulsive phases . 6 The 0 . 45 pW peak in the retract curve occurs just before the tip breaks free of the capillary force . The maximum noise in the dissipation data due to amplitude and phase noise is 20 fW (cid:126) 1 kHz bandwidth (cid:33) ; however , sys - tematic errors can be larger . A precise determination of (cid:118) 0 is important because this is used to determine the offset in the phase data . For high Q cantilevers , errors of several Hz can translate into absolute phase errors of a few degrees . For the data presented here , the error due to this effect is estimated to be 50 fW . The assumptions in the derivations are , that the steady - state motion of the cantilever is sinusoidal , and the damping on the body of the lever is described by a simple viscous damping coefﬁcient that remains unchanged when the tip begins interacting with the sample . Also , only the ﬁrst mode FIG . 1 . Spectra of the motion of the cantilever taken at different amplitudes showing that the motion remains nearly sinusoidal . (cid:126) a (cid:33) The free cantilever with the tip about 100 nm above the surface . (cid:126) b (cid:33) – (cid:126) d (cid:33) , taken at positions corresponding to the lettered arrows in Fig . 2 . The top scale has been nor - malized to the drive frequency to make it easier to identify harmonics of the cantilever motion at 2 (cid:118) , 3 (cid:118) , etc . Higher harmonics are visible in (cid:126) b (cid:33) – (cid:126) d (cid:33) as well as a broadening of the fundamental peak into sidebands . However , the total amplitude of the nonsinusoidal motion is 100 – 1000 times smaller than the fundamental peak (cid:126) including higher harmonics not shown in the ﬁgure (cid:33) , so the motion stays sinusoidal to a good approximation . There is very little energy carried in the second cantilever resonance at 475 kHz ; over 50 % of the power there is due to thermal excitation of the mode . 2614 Appl . Phys .

Note that no assumptions have been made concerning the nature of the tip – sample interaction , although only certain tip – sample interactions will yield nearly sinusoidal steady - state motion . The measured motion was very close to sinusoidal for both silicon and polyethyl - ene samples with cantilevers ranging from 4 to 100 N / m in stiffness . The fact that the steady - state oscillation is nearly sinusoidal does not imply the system is linear . In fact , obser - vation of the transients shows highly nonlinear behavior . Some insight into why the system can evolve into a nearly sinusoidal steady state is provided by the study of grazing impact oscillators . 21 , 22 Although the data presented here were for a cantilever tapping at a surface , the analysis presented works in any case where the cantilever oscillation remains close to sinusoidal . For noncontact microscopies such as electric force micros - copy (cid:126) EFM (cid:33) or magnetic force microscopy (cid:126) MFM (cid:33) , it can be more convenient to feedback on the frequency to keep the lever on resonance . In that case , the phase is held constant and changes in P tip appear in the cantilever amplitude . Gru¨t - ter et al . have recently measured dissipation in MFM by such a method . 23 In some earlier work , Denk and Pohl 24 measured electrical dissipation by measuring the width of the cantile - ver resonance . One important thing to note is the method presented here will only provide the total energy lost in the tip – sample in - teraction , not how or where it is lost . Figuring out speciﬁc places the energy is going will require modeling and creative experimentation . A similar problem arises in AFM force curves . The force on the tip can be the total of several forces acting simultaneously on the tip (cid:126) e . g . , capillary forces , van der Waals forces , magnetic forces (cid:33) , but we only get one mea - sured quantity : the total force on the tip . Yet , by looking at how this total force depends on distance , or what happens when we add salt to the solvent , we can start to guess the separate contributions to this force . The same thing should be possible with energy dissipation . In conclusion , we have shown a means for measuring the energy dissipated by the tip of an oscillating AFM cantilever . The ability to measure the energy dissipated in nanometer - sized contacts should prove to be useful in many respects , but the most important practical result of the work is that tapping - mode AFM phase images can now be interpreted in terms of energy dissipation .
