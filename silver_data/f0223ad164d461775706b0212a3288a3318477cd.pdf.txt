In plants , the evolutionarily ancient TSET / TPLATE complex ( TPC ) plays an essential , but not well - defined role in CME . Here , we show that two highly disordered TPC subunits , AtEH1 and AtEH2 function as scaffolds to drive biomolecular condensation of the complex . These condensates specifically nucleate on the plasma membrane through interactions with anionic phospholipids , and facilitate the dynamic recruitment and assembly of clathrin , early - , and late - stage endocytic accessory proteins . Importantly , clathrin forms ordered assemblies within the condensate environment . Biomolecular condensation therefore acts to promote dynamic protein assemblies throughout clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Furthermore , the disordered region sequence properties of AtEH1 regulate the material properties of the endocytic condensates in vivo and alteration of these material properties influences endocytosis dynamics , and consequently plant adaptive growth . Highlights • AtEH subunits are endocytic scaffolds which drive condensation of the TPC • AtEH1 condensates nucleate on the plasma membrane via lipid interactions • Condensation of AtEH1 / TPC facilitates clathrin re - arrangement and assembly • AtEH1 IDR1 composition controls condensate properties to regulate endocytosis Keywords Phase separation , Biomolecular condensate , Endocytosis , Membrane trafficking , Arabidopsis thaliana , TPLATE complex , clathrin 2 Introduction Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is an essential cellular internalisation pathway necessary for many cellular processes , including cell signalling , immune responses , and nutrient uptake ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Paez Valencia et al . , 2016 ) . Endocytosis is initiated through a network of transient interactions between cargo , adaptor proteins , membrane lipids , and the coat protein clathrin on the plasma membrane . Following initiation , clathrin polymerises into a lattice which bends as the membrane invaginates , leading to dynamin - dependent scission and release of the formed clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) . The assembly of these clathrin lattices is highly dynamic , and depends on a network of early accessory proteins which interact with the adaptor protein complex AP - 2 to stabilise clathrin - coated pits ( Chen and Schmid , 2020 ; Sochacki and Taraska , 2019 ) . Core endocytic machinery , including clathrin and AP - 2 was present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor ( Dacks and Robinson , 2017 ; Rout and Field , 2017 ) , suggesting that the underlying principles that facilitate clathrin - coat formation during endocytosis are largely conserved between eukaryotes . One key evolutionary difference is that the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and plants retained an ancient endocytic complex termed TSET , or TPLATE complex ( TPC ) , which was lost from metazoan and fungal lineages ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Hirst et al . , 2014 ) . TPC is essential for plant life , as viable knock - out mutants have not been identified ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Van Damme et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2019 ) . Recent studies have established the critical role of TPC during endocytosis by demonstrating its interaction with many essential endocytic components , including anionic phospholipids ( Yperman et al . , 2021a ; Yperman et al . , 2021b ) , the AP - 2 complex ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2023 ) , clathrin ( Van Damme et al . , 2011 ) , and ubiquitinated cargo ( Grones et al . , 2022 ) . Furthermore , destabilisation of TPC leads to impaired endocytic internalisation , and disrupts membrane bending during clathrin - coated pit formation ( Johnson et al . , 2021 ; Wang et al . , 2021 ) . TPC is present throughout endocytosis progression , from the earliest detectable phase until vesicle scission and uncoating ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Narasimhan et al . , 2020 ) . Collectively , these studies support a multi - functional role for TPC during endocytosis . While TPC shares structural homology with COPI and AP - complexes ( Rout and Field , 2017 ; Yperman et al . , 2021b ) , TPC subunits do not have direct orthologs to human and fungal proteins . However , TPC subunits contain common vesicle trafficking related domains and motifs which has provided insight into their molecular function ( Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . Notably , the plant specific TPC subunits AtEH1 / Pan1 ( AtEH1 ) and AtEH2 / Pan1 ( AtEH2 ) share partial homology to the Eps15 homology ( EH ) domains proteins Eps15 and Intersectin in humans , and Ede1p and Pan1p in yeast . A conserved function in autophagy of AtEH proteins ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) , and Ede1p and Pan1p in yeast ( Liu et al . , 2022 ; Wilfling et al . , 2020 ) support the idea that they are functional homologs . We previously showed that AtEH1 co - purifies with AP - 2 ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2023 ) , and AtEH1 interacts with anionic phospholipids and cargo ( Yperman et al . , 2021a ) . Interactomics and live cell imaging suggest TPC assembles as an octameric complex on the membrane during the initiation of endocytosis ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) , with the lipid binding proteins AtEH1 , AtEH2 , and the muniscin - like protein TML forming an interface with the plasma membrane ( Yperman et al . , 2021b ) . In comparison , human Eps15 , intersectin and the muniscin FCHo mediate multivalent interactions between themselves , anionic phospholipids ( Alaoui et al . , 2022 ; Day et al . , 2021 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ) , and AP - 2 ( Hollopeter et al . , 2014 ; Ma et al . , 2015 ; Partlow et al . , 2022 ) to promote the initiation and growth of 3 clathrin coated pits during endocytosis ( Bhave et al . , 2020 ; Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Lehmann et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , AtEH1 , AtEH2 and TML may be plant endocytic initiation components . Recently , membraneless organelles ( or biomolecular condensates ) , which can be assembled through phase separation has emerged as a fundamental mechanism to compartmentalise cellular functions ( Banani et al . , 2017 ; Choi et al . , 2020 ; Snead and Gladfelter , 2019 ; Zhao and Zhang , 2020 ) . In animal and yeast , Eps15 / FCHo and Ede1 have been shown to promote the formation of condensates during the early phase of endocytosis ( Day et al . , 2021 ; Kozak and Kaksonen , 2022 ) . Here , we demonstrate that in plants , AtEH proteins form condensates on the plasma membrane to recruit cytosolic proteins throughout endocytosis . Moreover , using CLEM - ET we found that clathrin forms lattices within the liquid - like assemblies generated by AtEH1 / TPC . Evolutionarily analysis revealed that the physical properties of TPC condensates are determined from the sequence chemistry of the intrinsically disordered region 1 ( IDR1 ) of AtEH1 . Changes to these properties alter endocytic kinetics in vivo . Our findings provide general insight on how collective interactions shape endocytosis in eukaryotes . Results AtEH1 and AtEH2 phase separate in vivo and in vitro Yeast Ede1 and human Eps15 are key endocytic components containing EH domains and intrinsic disordered regions , and have been shown to phase separate ( Day et al . , 2021 ; Kozak and Kaksonen , 2022 ; Wilfling et al . , 2020 ) . Sequence analysis revealed that AtEH1 and AtEH2 are highly disordered compared to other TPC subunits ( Figures S1A and S1B ) , containing three intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) and prion - like regions ( Figure 1A ) , common features of proteins which phase separate ( Alberti et al . , 2019 ) . Because phase separation is concentration dependent , we tested whether AtEH1 and AtEH2 may form condensates when over - expressed in cells . We observed punctate cytosolic and membrane associated puncta after transient overexpression of AtEH proteins in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) , or stable overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Figure 1B ) , consistent with previous studies ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) . Similar compartments were observed by heterologous expression of AtEH proteins in fission yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) ( Figure 1B ) . We next asked whether these punctate assemblies have physical properties consistent with biomolecular condensates . At very high expression levels we observed the dynamic growth and shrinking of puncta consistent with Ostwald ripening ( Figure 1C ) , as well as fusion of puncta ( Figure 1D ) . Furthermore , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments indicate that AtEH1 - GFP molecules are rapidly exchanged between the puncta and the cytosolic pool of proteins ( Figure 1E ) . Collectively , these properties are consistent with protein phase separation , and indicate that AtEH1 and AtEH2 have the capacity to form biomolecular condensates in vivo . Consequently , our results indicate that the previously identified co - localisation between AtEH1 and ATG8 in N . benthamiana ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) indicates partitioning of ATG8 with AtEH1 condensates , rather than induction of autophagosomes in that system . Since AtEH1 and AtEH2 have a similar structure and ability to phase separate , we focused our work on AtEH1 due to its more central connection to TML and TPLATE in TPC compared to AtEH2 ( Yperman et al . , 2021b ) . We next examined whether AtEH1 can phase separate in vitro . We generated three AtEH1 constructs fused to MBP - TEV - GFP : full length ( AtEH1 FL ) , an IDR3 truncation ( AtEH1 ∆ IDR3 ) , and a coiled - coil ( CC ) and IDR3 truncation ( AtEH1 ∆CC∆IDR3 ) ( Figure 1F ) . We expressed and purified these proteins 4 recombinantly in E . coli ( Figure 1G ) , and then performed in vitro phase separation assays under different salt and protein concentrations ( Figure 1H ) . AtEH1 FL underwent phase separation at relatively low protein concentrations ( ≤ 0 . 1 µM ) , but showed relatively limited fluorescence recovery ( Figure S1C ) . This may suggest that intra - molecular interactions promote phase separation but limit molecular re - arrangement in the absence of other TPC components . Additionally , phase separation was drastically reduced when the IDR3 was truncated ( AtEH1 ∆ IDR3 ) , and abolished when the coiled - coil domain was further truncated ( AtEH1 ∆CC∆IDR3 ) ( Figure 1H ) , indicating that the coiled - coil and IDR3 are important domains promoting phase separation in the absence of other factors . Condensation of AtEH1 is controlled by multiple regions , including IDR1 We next asked whether we could determine the region ( s ) which promote condensation of AtEH1 in vivo . To test this , we systematically removed each intrinsically disordered region ( IDR ) and structured domain in AtEH1 and quantified the relative concentration of protein in the cytosol ( light phase ; C L ) , as a proxy for protein saturation concentration ( C sat ) ( Figures 2A - B and S1A ) . Deletion of all domains resulted in significantly increased C L , implying that both IDRs and structured domains promote condensation in vivo . Notably , deletion of IDR1 resulted in abnormally formed condensates , suggesting that IDR1 may function as a regulatory region ( Figures 2A ) . To investigate the function of AtEH1 IDRs , we first conducted a sequence alignment of 128 EH / Pan1 homologs throughout 700 million years of evolution . Conservation analysis revealed that IDR1 and IDR2 are relatively divergent at the single amino acid level ( Figure S2B ) . Conversely IDR3 , which contains putative short linear motifs that may facilitate protein interactions , had higher sequence conservation . Furthermore , analysis of homologous IDR1 sequences indicated that the proportion of amino acid classes was relatively conserved among plant EH / Pan1 homologs ( Figure . S2C ) . Therefore , we infer that the sequence composition , but not the order of residues in IDR1 is functionally relevant . To test this , we scrambled the IDR1 sequence of AtEH1 , or replaced it with a corresponding IDR sequence from moss ( Marchantia polymorpha ; MpEH1 ) , yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; ScPan1 , ScEde1 ) , or humans ( Homo sapiens ; HsITSN1 ) . Scrambling , or replacement with MpEH1 , HsITSN1 , or ScEde1 IDRs resulted in cells with mostly regularly distributed condensates ( Figures 2C and D ) . However , replacement with ScPan1 IDR caused irregularly distributed condensates which frequently accumulated in cell lobes ( Figures 2C ) . Sequence composition analysis revealed that ScPan1 had an unusually low proportion of basic residues ( 1 . 7 % ) , compared to AtEH1 ( 4 . 9 % ) ( Figures 2E ) . These results suggest that the amino acid composition of IDR1 is critical for condensate formation . To investigate the influence of specific residues on condensate properties , we mutated aromatic , basic , acidic , and proline residues in the IDR1 of AtEH1 . Exchanging tyrosine and phenylalanine residues for tryptophan ( 12YF > W ) , or serine ( 12YF > S ) to increase or decreasing aromatic interaction strength respectively , caused the formation of abnormally large or unusually shaped condensates ( Figures 2F and G ) . Mutation of proline ( 26P > G ) , or acidic ( 6DE > A ) residues had no visible effect , while mutation of basic ( 8KR > G ) residues caused an aberrant condensate accumulation in cell lobes similar to those observed with the IDR of ScPan1 . Taken together , our results show that the composition , rather than the sequence order of residues is important for controlling AtEH1 condensate properties , and that there is likely selective pressure to maintain the IDR sequence composition within an optimal range . 5 AtEH1 condensates are nucleated through interactions with anionic phospholipids on the plasma membrane Membrane surfaces have been shown to dramatically lower the concentration threshold required for protein condensates to form ( Snead and Gladfelter , 2019 ) . As AtEH1 is recruited to the plasma membrane during the early phase of endocytosis simultaneously with other TPC subunits ( Wang et al . , 2020 ) , we reasoned that the plasma membrane could act as a surface to preferentially nucleate AtEH1 condensates . Supporting this hypothesis , we observed individual nucleation events on the plasma membrane in N . benthamiana , with condensates gradually increasing in size before dissociating from the membrane ( Figure 3A and Video S1 ) . These nucleation events had intensity profiles inconsistent with endocytic foci ( Johnson et al . , 2021 ; Narasimhan et al . , 2020 ) , and likely represent the transient accumulation of AtEH1 molecules on the membrane in this system . Condensate movement can be explained by the interaction of AtEH1 with actin ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) , as treatment with the actin polymerising inhibitor Latrunculin B abolished condensate movement ( Figure S3A ) . Furthermore , without IDR3 , AtEH1 formed evenly spaced , immobile membrane - associated condensates which did not appear to coarsen ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . This finding is consistent with reports that membrane tethered condensates are restricted in size and rapidly arrest ( Snead et al . , 2022 ) . Together , these data indicate that the plasma membrane acts as a surface to nucleate AtEH1 condensates . As AtEH proteins bind negatively charged anionic phospholipids via their EH domains ( Yperman et al . , 2021a ) , we asked whether AtEH1 condensates could be nucleated by interaction with anionic phospholipids on the plasma membrane . To test this , we mutated the three positively charged arginine and lysine residues that mediate lipid binding in each individual EH domain ( Yperman et al . , 2021a ) , and examined the effect on condensate formation using full length ( AtEH1 FL ) and truncated ( AtEH1 ∆ IDR3 ) reporters ( Figure 3D ) . Mutation of individual EH domains significantly increased the cytosolic protein concentration and lead to the formation of irregular condensates ( Figures 3D and 3E ) , indicating that functional lipid interactions are required for normal condensate formation and properties . Moreover , combined mutation of both EH domains completely abolished condensate formation in the AtEH1 FL reporter , although a few condensates were observed in the truncated AtEH1 ∆ IDR3 reporter . Thus , AtEH1 condensates are primarily nucleated via phospholipid interactions , while additional cues , such as membrane - bound protein partners may act as additional nucleation factors . Endocytosis requires the activity of multiple anionic phospholipids in the plasma membrane ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . In plants , this includes phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) , and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) ( Noack and Jaillais , 2017 ; Noack and Jaillais , 2020 ) . To determine whether specific lipids are required for condensate nucleation expressed AtEH1 in Nicotiana tabacum pollen tubes which maintain a distinctive lipid signature ( Figure S3B ) ( Potocký et al . , 2014 ) . AtEH1 preferentially formed condensates at the sub - apical region of growing pollen tubes , which correlated with PA and PI4P biosensors , but not with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figure S3B ) . These findings are consistent with our previous report that EH domains strongly bind PA ( Yperman et al . , 2021a ) . Furthermore , the TPC components TPLATE and TML show similar localisation patterns in pollen tubes when expressed at endogenous levels ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Van Damme et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that the lipid - dependent nucleation of AtEH1 condensates and the recruitment of TPC to membranes during endocytosis are analogous events . 6 AtEH1 is a scaffold protein which selectively sequesters endocytic proteins Condensate assembly is often driven by highly multivalent proteins , called scaffolds , which passively recruit lower valency proteins , known as clients , to form condensates ( Banani et al . , 2016 ) . Since AtEH subunits are multivalent proteins which initiate condensate formation , we asked whether they act as scaffolds to selectively recruit other endocytic proteins . To identify potential client proteins , we performed proximity labelling proteomics in A . thaliana cell culture using AtEH1 - TurboID as a bait ( Figure 4A ) . We also used TPLATE - TurboID ( Arora et al . , 2020 ) as a control to differentiate TPC - dependent endocytic clients from proteins identified due to AtEH1 overexpression . The endocytic proteins common to both datasets include TOM - 1LIKE ( TOL ) proteins TOL6 and TOL9 , members of an ancestral ESCRT - 0 complex which function as ubiquitin receptors at the plasma membrane ( Figure 4B ) ( Blanc et al . , 2009 ; Herman et al . , 2011 ; Korbei et al . , 2013 ; Moulinier - Anzola et al . , 2020 ) . We also identified late phase endocytic proteins , including dynamins ( DRP1B , DRP2A , DRP2B ) which mediate vesicle scission ( Fujimoto et al . , 2010 ; Konopka and Bednarek , 2008 ) , and AUXILIN - LIKE ( AUXL ) proteins , which function in vesicle uncoating ( Adamowski et al . , 2018 ) . We tested client recruitment using a partitioning assay in N . benthamiana ( Figure 4C ) , focusing on client proteins containing disordered regions which could potentially mediate weak - multivalent interactions with AtEH1 ( Figures S4A and 4B ) . TOL6 , TOL9 and AUXL1 readily partitioned into AtEH1 condensates in N . benthamiana , independently of the IDR3 . Conversely , DRP2a required IDR3 for partitioning ( Figures 4D and 4E ) , indicating that IDR3 can facilitate protein interactions . PICALM3 did not partition , and may require additional factors , such as membrane curvature ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) . Additionally , we demonstrated a direct interaction between AtEH1 and TOL6 / TOL9 by partitioning assays in vitro ( Figures 4F and 4G ) . We next asked if we could identify the sequence features of TOL6 which facilitate its interaction with AtEH1 . Intriguingly , we found that the AtEH1 - TurboID dataset was enriched with disordered proteins , specifically proteins containing prion - like domains such as TOL6 ( Figures S6A - 6B ) . This suggests that AtEH1 mediates weak , multivalent interactions with specific prion - like domains . Supporting this , we observed partitioning of nuclear prion - like proteins identified as highly enriched in the AtEH1 - TurboID dataset ( Figures S4C ) . To specifically test whether the prion - like domain of TOL6 interacts with AtEH1 , we performed a chimera experiment by transplanting the prion - like domain ( PrLD ) of TOL6 onto TOL3 , which lacks a prion domain and does not interact with AtEH1 ( Figures S4D ) . This TOL3 - PrLD TOL6 chimera readily partitioned into AtEH1 condensates ( Figures S4D ) , showing that prion - like domain recruitment is one mechanism facilitating partitioning . Collectively , our data demonstrate that AtEH1 is an endocytic scaffold which selectively recruits cytosolic adaptor proteins throughout endocytosis via multivalent interactions . AtEH1 condensates facilitate clathrin recruitment and re - arrangement Endocytosis involves the ordered assembly of cytosolic adaptors and the coat protein clathrin to basket - like assemblies on the plasma membrane . Because condensation of AtEH1 is sufficient for the recruitment of multiple cytosolic endocytic accessory proteins , we asked if we could observe structural arrangements within AtEH1 condensates . To achieve this , we combined correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) with electron tomography ( ET ) to examine the ultrastructure of AtEH1 - GFP condensates in a stable A . thaliana overexpression line ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . We observed large cytosolic AtEH1 condensates which had remarkably similar electron density as nearby clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) ( Figure S5C ) . Tomography reconstruction revealed the presence of electron dense 7 deposits and ordered polygonal cage - like assemblies which resemble clathrin triskelia and partial clathrin cages ( Figure 5A , Video S2 ) . These observations suggest that clathrin molecules can organise into higher ordered assemblies within the liquid - like environment generated by AtEH1 . We therefore examined the localisation of clathrin light chain ( CLC2 ) in AtEH1 - GFP seedlings . Similar to previous work in N . benthamiana ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) , clathrin readily partitioned into AtEH1 condensates ( Figure 5B ) , supporting our view that these condensates are composed of assembled clathrin molecules . Furthermore , we observed substantial clathrin accumulation around some condensates ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that clathrin has an inherent affinity for these assemblies . These findings show that condensation of AtEH1 is sufficient to recruit and concentrate clathrin , and facilitate its re - arrangement into ordered assemblies . Concentration of TPC on a membrane is sufficient for condensate formation and clathrin assembly Our previous work suggests TPC exists as a stable octameric complex in the cytosol , which is recruited collectively to the plasma membrane during the initiation of endocytosis ( Wang et al . , 2020 ; Yperman et al . , 2021b ) . Further supporting this , all TPC subunits ( except LOLITA ) were enriched in a large scale biotinylated isoxazole ( b - isox ) precipitation experiment which selectively precipitates disordered proteins ( Zhang et al . , 2022 ) ( Figure S6A ) . We independently confirmed these findings by b - isox precipitation and immunoblotting against AtEH1 ( highly disordered TPC subunit ) and TPLATE ( low disorder TPC subunit ) , which showed enrichment of both proteins ( Figure 6A ) . Furthermore , highly disordered endocytic client proteins , including TOL6 , TOL9 , AUXL1 , AUXL2 , and DRP2a were also identified as enriched in the b - isox fraction ( Figure S6A ) , while structured proteins like clathrin , tubulin and AP - 2 were not ( Figure 6A and S6A ) . Our previous experiments relied on overexpression of AtEH1 to generate condensates . However , to be functionally relevant for endocytosis , condensation must occur via TPC as a whole on the membrane . We therefore asked whether the concentrated assembly of TPC at endogenous stoichiometric ratio on a membrane is sufficient to generate condensates . Because it is not possible to examine the ultrastructure of endocytic pits in planta due to poor membrane preservation , we used an inducible FRB - FKBP rapamycin - based interaction system to concentrate TPC on mitochondrial membranes ( Figure 6B and S6B - C ) ( Robinson et al . , 2010 ; Winkler et al . , 2021 ) . Using this system , we inducibly re - localised TPLATE to mitochondria clusters ( Figure 6C and Video S3 ) . These clusters contained AtEH1 and clathrin , confirming that other TPC subunits and interacting proteins were recruited ( Figure S6D ) . Next , we employed a CLEM - ET and segmentation approach to characterise the 3D ultrastructure of these TPC - mitochondria clusters ( Figure S6E ) . We observed distinct ribosome exclusion zones in the interior of the mitochondria clusters after rapamycin treatment , which were not observed in the untreated control ( Figure 6D and S6E ) . This zone contained ordered , clathrin - lattice - like assemblies which spanned the entirety of the area ( Figure 6D and Video S4 ) . We also observed clathrin coated vesicles ( CCVs ) and electron dense accumulations on the edges of the mitochondria clusters ( Figure 6D and S6E ) . These observations were reminiscent of our CLEM - ET ultrastructural data of condensates driven by AtEH1 alone . Together , these data indicate that concentration of TPC on a membrane is sufficient to generate condensates which promote clathrin recruitment and re - arrangement . Thus , AtEH1 and AtEH2 promote condensation as part of TPC . 8 The physical properties of TPC driven condensates are important for endocytosis progression Since TPC recruits clathrin and other endocytic machinery , we asked whether condensation of TPC is essential for functional endocytosis , for example by enabling the recruitment and re - arrangement of endocytic machinery throughout the process . We reasoned that we could manipulate the properties of TPC condensates by altering the aromatic interaction strength of the IDR1 of AtEH1 , since aromatic residues have been shown to promote phase separation of prion - like domain proteins ( Brangwynne et al . , 2015 ; Martin et al . , 2020 ) . We created modified AtEH1 reporters by substituting phenylalanine and tyrosine residues with serine ( 12YF > S ) or tryptophan ( 12YF > W ) to decrease or increase IDR interaction strength , respectively ( Figure 2F ) . Because AtEH1 condensates are motile , we could infer the material properties of AtEH1 IDR1 mut condensates by high speed 4D imaging . Surface renderings reveal that AtEH1 YF > W condensates were highly dynamic and irregular shaped , suggesting a gel - like material state ( Figure 7A - 7B , and Video S5 ) . Comparatively , AtEH1 YF > S and AtEH1 WT condensates were more spherical , indicating a more liquid - like material state ( Figure 7A - B ) . To further assess the molecular properties of AtEH1 IDR1 mutants , we performed a ratiometric FRAP assay by expressing both AtEH1 WT and AtEH1 mut constructs from an individual T - DNA locus , and comparing the FRAP half recovery time ( t 1 / 2 ) . Recovery of AtEH1 YF > S was significantly faster than the AtEH1 WT control , indicating a decrease in intramolecular interaction strength between AtEH1 molecules ( Figure 7C and 7D ) . Conversely , AtEH1 YF > W showed a delayed recovery , indicating an increase in intramolecular interaction strength . Our results demonstrate that altering the IDR1 interaction strength of AtEH1 can modulate the dynamics and material properties of AtEH1 condensates . Finally , we aimed to understand how altering the properties of TPC condensates affects endocytosis . To achieve this , we generated native promoter ( pAtEH1 : AtEH1 - mGFP ) wild type ( FL ) , and aromatic mutant ( YF > S , YF > W ) A . thaliana reporters . These lines were functional as they rescued the A . thaliana male sterile eh1 - 1 mutant ( Figure S7A and S7C ) . We identified multiple complementation lines for each construct containing close to endogenous levels of AtEH1 fusion protein ( Figure S7B ) . To determine if these plants had defects in bulk endocytic flux , we assayed AtEH1 WT and AtEH1 mut A . thaliana seedlings using an FM4 - 64 dye internalisation assay ( Figure S7D ) . Bulk internalisation was not significantly different in control AtEH1 WT lines to WT Col - 0 seedlings , but was slightly reduced in AtEH1 YFS lines , and vastly reduced in AtEH1 YFW lines Figure S7D and S7E . Thus , alteration of condensate properties impairs endocytosis . To test whether these defects are due to an alteration in endocytosis dynamics , we performed live - cell imaging of endocytic foci in A . thaliana root cells ( Figure 7E ) . Initial kymograph analysis showed that the decreased intramolecular interaction strength in AtEH1 YFS seedlings corresponded to a reduction in endocytosis lifetime , while increasing intramolecular interaction strength in AtEH1 YFW extended endocytosis lifetime ( Figure 7E ) . We further assessed this quantitatively using an automated analysis of endocytosis lifetime using an automated detected and analysis pipeline ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ; Johnson et al . , 2020 ) . Consistent with the kymograph analysis , analysis of > 14 , 000 endocytic events from each genotype revealed a reduction in endocytic lifetime in AtEH1 YFS seedlings compared to the AtEH1 WT control ( Figure 7F ) , and an increase in lifetime of AtEH1 YFW mutant seedlings . Thus , the molecular re - arrangement and material properties of condensates driven by AtEH1 / TPC influences the underlying progression of endocytosis . The altered endocytic progression also had a physiological effect , as we observed delayed root gravitropism responses in AtEH1 YFW lines , a process which requires TPC - dependent endocytic activity ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ) . Taken together , our results show that condensate physical properties modulate endocytosis and subsequently impact plant adaptive 9 growth , and that the IDR sequences which determine these properties likely converge on an evolutionary optimal code . Discussion The formation of clathrin coated pits during endocytosis requires the dynamic re - arrangement of a meshwork of proteins including clathrin , adaptors , and accessory proteins ( Chen and Schmid , 2020 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Here , we discovered that AtEH proteins drive biomolecular condensation of the TPLATE complex during clathrin - mediated endocytosis in plants . We show that these condensates enable the recruitment and assembly of clathrin and accessory proteins , from the initiation of endocytosis to vesicle scission . The biophysical properties of these condensates are partially derived from the sequence chemistry of the IDR of the AtEH proteins , which share strong similarity with their human and yeast counterparts . We demonstrate in vivo , that alteration of condensate properties impairs the basic progression of endocytosis and adaptive plant growth . Therefore , biomolecular condensation is an essential biophysical mechanism which can help explain how collective interactions between endocytic machinery generate a clathrin coated pit . Plasma membrane recruitment nucleates AtEH1 / TPC condensation Our work highlights a link between the nucleation of TPC condensates on the membrane and the initiation of endocytosis . Our in vivo CLEM data shows that concentration of TPC on a membrane is sufficient to trigger condensation , likely by limiting molecular diffusion to a two - dimensional plane which lowers the nucleation energy barrier ( Snead and Gladfelter , 2019 ; Snead et al . , 2022 ) . In our model , TPC is initially recruited to the membrane by direct interactions with phospholipids via AtEH subunits . These initial assemblies are self - reinforced by recruitment of additional TPC units through multivalent interactions mediated by AtEH subunits . Once TPC is sufficiently concentrated on the membrane , this promotes the downstream recruitment of adaptors and clathrin to initiate endocytosis and the assembly of clathrin - coated pits . In this way condensation functions as an organisational hub ( Shin and Brangwynne , 2017 ) . This model is consistent with work in humans and yeast , where initiator proteins Eps15 / FCHo and ScEde1 promote condensation and recruitment of endocytic accessory proteins to the membrane via interactions with the phospholipid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Day et al . , 2021 ; Kozak and Kaksonen , 2022 ) . How does condensation of TPC promote endocytosis initiation at specific sites ? AtEH1 remains at the plasma membrane upon destabilisation of TPC ( Wang et al . , 2021 ) , indicating a high affinity for membranes . Specifically , AtEH1 interacts with PA and phosphoinositides ( Yperman et al . , 2021a ) , two key phospholipids implicated in endocytosis in plants ( Noack and Jaillais , 2020 ; Platre et al . , 2018 ) . These lipids may act as a molecular signature to specify the recruitment and condensation of TPC . Interaction of TPC with PI4P via the muniscin - like subunit TML may further enhance recruitment specificity ( Yperman et al . , 2021b ) , or could promote complex stability at the membrane , similar to the role of FCHo ( Bhave et al . , 2020 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ; Lehmann et al . , 2019 ) . We also identified a link between AtEH1 and TOM1 - LIKE ( TOL ) proteins , which function in plants as ubiquitin receptors , analogous to the ESCRT - 0 complex ( Korbei et al . , 2013 ; Mosesso et al . , 2019 ; Moulinier - Anzola et al . , 2020 ) . We speculate that recognition of TOL proteins by AtEH subunits promote condensation and endocytosis initiation at membrane regions enriched for ubiquitinated cargo , possibly in co - operation with the TPC subunit TASH3 ( Grones et al . , 2022 ) . This coupling of TPC recruitment and condensation to the co - operative recognition of lipids and ubiquitinated cargo would ensure the highly regulated assembly of clathrin - coated vesicles on the plasma membrane . Similar , lipid — or receptor — mediated nucleation mechanisms may exist to drive the selective assembly of other membrane associated condensates , for example during autophagy ( Fujioka et al . , 2020 ) . However , direct observations of 10 nucleation events on the membrane in vivo remains challenging , owing to the transient and small size of such assemblies , especially during endocytosis ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . Condensation of TPC promotes clathrin and accessory protein assembly During the dynamic growth phase of clathrin coated pits , clathrin molecules are rapidly deposited at the edge of the growing lattice ( Robinson , 2015 ; Sochacki and Taraska , 2019 ) . Eps15 , FCHO , Intersectin and ScEde1 partition to the lattice edge , and are continuously displaced from entering the inner lattice ( Mund et al . , 2018 ; Partlow et al . , 2022 ; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) . A similar model has been proposed with TPC confined to the lattice edge in plants ( Johnson et al . , 2021 ) . Our CLEM - ET experiments reveal that condensation of AtEH1 / TPC promotes the recruitment and re - arrangement of clathrin molecules in a liquid - like environment . TPC is well positioned to catalyse the sustained assembly of clathrin molecules into the growing lattice , and could explain why TPC arrives before clathrin on the membrane ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Narasimhan et al . , 2020 ) . How clathrin is recruited into these condensates is not clear , but this could involve direct interaction with TPC subunits ( Gadeyne et al . , 2014 ; Van Damme et al . , 2011 ) . However , these interactions alone are not sufficient for the co - purification of clathrin with TPC in b - isox precipitation experiments . Clathrin recruitment and assembly in condensates is therefore likely driven by a combination of transient , low - affinity interactions , and relatively stable , high - affinity interactions between clathrin , TPC , and other clathrin - interacting molecules , such as AP - 2 . These collective interactions may occur within an ideal physiochemical generated by condensation of TPC , resulting in the efficient assembly of clathrin at the edge of growing lattices . Furthermore , condensation could help explain mechanistically how clathrin is rapidly turned over throughout endocytosis ( Avinoam et al . , 2015 ) , which is a key requirement to build an expanding clathrin cage . Besides clathrin , our data suggest that TPC facilitates the assembly and re - arrangement of dynamin and auxilin , likely at the neck of invaginated clathrin coated pits . Condensation of dynamin has been shown to enhance its scission activity ( Imoto et al . , 2022 ) , supporting our model that condensation enables TPC to act as an organisational hub to assemble cytosolic endocytic proteins throughout endocytosis . Our work also highlights evolutionary differences between endocytosis across kingdoms , as condensation of ScEde1 and Eps15 - FCHo is coupled to endocytosis initiation , as these components are disassembled from the membrane before scission ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Given that middle - late arriving proteins ScSla1 ( Bergeron - Sandoval et al . , 2021 ) , and human endophilin can phase separate ( Mondal et al . , 2022 ) , condensation throughout endocytosis in these systems may be driven by discrete modules , rather than a stable complex . IDR composition is a hidden regulator of endocytic dynamics The physical properties of condensates are controlled by multivalent , co - operative interactions which form a physically cross - linked network ( Boeynaems et al . , 2018 ) . Our data indicates that the sequence composition of the IDR1 of AtEH1 plays a significant role in controlling the properties of TPC driven condensates . Modification of IDR1 interaction strength influences the material state and molecular exchange rate of these condensates , presumably by affecting the degree of cross - linking between AtEH1 molecules . Importantly , we show that divergence from this evolutionarily ideal composition reduces endocytosis efficiency in vivo . Given that the IDR composition of AtEH / homologs is similar throughout evolution , there is likely an optimal physiochemical environment derived from IDR properties which provide a balance between ordered , solid - like , and flexible , liquid - like network assemblies . Notably , artificially strengthening Eps15 dimerisation during early clathrin coated pit formation impairs endocytosis in human cells ( Day et al . , 2021 ) , highlighting that multivalency driven by scaffold dimerisation or IDR interactions is an essential aspect of endocytosis . 11 It is unclear how the biophysical properties and selectivity of protein interactions are encoded into the sequence chemistry of the IDRs of AtEH proteins ( Choi et al . , 2020 ; Martin and Mittag , 2018 ) . Furthermore , whether these IDR - derived condensate properties are unique to endocytosis , and how they have been evolutionarily tuned is unknown . Given that AtEH1 and AtEH2 are not redundant , and most land plants contain at least two EH / Pan1 homologs , independent proteins may mediate differential protein recruitment to reprogram endocytosis in an environmentally responsive manner . In summary , our study identifies biomolecular condensation as a fundamental organisation principle promoting the assembly of clathrin and other key molecules throughout endocytosis . TPC functions as a central organiser for endocytosis in plants , and achieves this through using core principles which appear common between eukaryotic organisms . Our findings have implications for understanding how condensates form on membranes , and how they act as an organisation hub to generate selective and dynamic interaction networks to facilitate vesicle trafficking .

clem / Biorender https : / / www . biorender . com / Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia - 0 ( Col - 0 ) plants were used for all experiments . Seeds were surface sterilised by chlorine gas and grown on ½ strength Murashige and Skoog ( ½ MS ) medium containing 0 . 6 % ( w / v ) agar , pH 5 . 8 , without sucrose . Seedlings were stratified for 48 h at 4°C in the dark , and transferred to continuous light conditi ons ( 68 μE m−2 s−1 photosynthetically active radiation ) at 21 °C in a growth chamber . Imaging was performed on 4 – 5 - day old seedlings unless otherwise indicated . β - Estradiol induction of the pRPS5A : XVE lines was performed by transferring 3 – day - old seedlings to ½ MS medium containing 1 µM β - estradiol . Chemical treatments β - Estradiol ( 20 mM stock in DMSO ) , Latrunculin B ( 4 mM stock in DMSO ) , and Rapamycin ( 10mM stock in DMSO ) were used at the concentrations indicated . Molecular cloning All constructs were cloned and assembled using the Green Gate cloning system unless otherwise indicated ( Lampropoulos et al . , 2013 ) , and are detailed in Table S1 . Entry vectors were assembled by Gibson assembly using NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly . For generation of mutated constructs , gene fragments were synthesised using Twist Bioscience . To generate the constructs used for heterologous expression in yeast cells , AtEH1 and its variants coding sequences were amplified and cloned into pDUAL - Pnmt1 - yeGFP vector by the ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit ( Vazyme , C112 ) . The constructs for in vitro protein expression were cloned by 15 inserting AtEH1 ( FL ) , AtEH1 ( ∆ IDR3 ) and AtEH1 ( ∆ CC ∆ IDR3 ) coding sequences into MBP - HIS - GFP vector , with maltose binding protein ( MBP ) at N - terminus following a TEV cleavage site and a green fluorescence protein ( GFP ) at C - terminus . The sequences of TOL6 and TOL9 were amplified and inserted into the pRSFduet - 6×His - mCherry vector to generate mCherry - TOL6 and mCherry - TOL9 constructs for in vitro protein expression . To prepare the PA marker construct ( pLat52 : : mRFP : NES - 2xSpo20p - PABD ) , NES - Spo20p - PABD was first amplified using P1 and P2 primers and YFP : Spo20p - PABD ( Potocký et al . , 2014 ) as a template and introduced into mRFP : 2xSpo20p - PABD ( Pejchar et al . , 2020 ) using XbaI / SpeI sites to make mRFP : NES - 2xSpo20p - PABD . To prepare the PI4P marker construct ( pLat52 : : mRFP : 2xP4M - SidM ) , 2xP4M - SidM was first amplified using P3 and P4 primers and GFP : P4M - SidM2x ( a gift from Prof . Tamas Balla , Addgene plasmid # 51472 ) as a template and introduced into the vector pHD22 , kindly provided by Prof . Benedikt Kost , using XbaI / ApaI sites to make mRFP : 2xP4M - SidM . The construct for the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 marker , mRFP : 2xPHPLC ẟ 1 , was described previously ( Scholz et al . , 2022 ) . Generation of A . thaliana reporter lines To generate the pEH1 : EH1 - GFP reporters , 2356 bp promoter and 5’UTR were fused to the CDS of AtEH1 and mGFP using Golden Gate cloning . Transformed via floral dip ( Clough and Bent , 1998 ) into plants heterozygous for the eh1 - 1 T - DNA ( SALK 083997 ) . Positive transformants were selected by spraying with Basta solution on seedlings grown in soil . Heterozygous eh1 - 1 plants were selected , and in the following generation seedlings homozygous for eh1 - 1 were identified by genotyping and confirmed via Western blot . To generate the pH3 . 3 - MITOTagBFP2 - FRB pLAT52 - TPLATE - mCherryFKBP tplate line , plants heterozygous for the tplate T - DNA ( SALK 0030086 ) were transformed with pLAT52 - TPLATE - mCherryFKBP by floral dip . T1 Plants were selected with 25 mg / L hygromycin for presence of pLAT52 : : TPLATE - mCherry - FKBP , and genotyped to select tplate ( + / - ) . T2 plants were screened to identify tplate ( - / - ) plants . The following T3 seedlings were transformed with pH3 . 3 : : MITO - TagBFP2 - FRB * ( Winkler et al . , 2021 ) . T1 plants were selected with 10 mg / L Basta , and plants homozygous for pH3 . 3 - MITOTagBFP2 - FRB , pLAT52 - TPLATE - mCherryFKBP , and tplate were identified in the following generations . Gravitropism assay 5 day old A . thaliana seedlings were grown on ½ MS media . Seedlings of similar sizes were first transferred to a fresh ½ MS plate to reduce variability due to potential germination rate differences , and then gravistimulated by turning the plate 90° . Images were acquired every 15 minutes using a Canon EOS camera . The time point of 8 hours was chosen for analysis as this is when we observed near complete bending of WT Col - 0 plants . The root tip angle was calculated in Fiji using the angle tool , and the results were placed into 22 . 5° bins . Transient expression in Tobacco epidermis N . benthamiana plants were grown in a greenhouse under long - day conditions ( 6 – 22 h light , 100 PAR , 21 °C ) in soil ( Saniflor osmocote pro NPK : 16 - 11 - 10 + magnesium and trace elements ) . Transient expression was performed by leaf infiltration according to ( Sparkes et al . , 2006 ) using GV3101 Agrobacterium strains containing plasmids of interest . To reduce silencing , an agrobacterium strain containing the p19 silencing inhibitor was co - infiltrated for all experiments . Transiently transformed N . benthamiana were imaged three to four days after infiltration . 16 Pollen tube transformation , imaging , and analysis Experiments were performed step by step according to the protocol described in ( Noack et al . , 2019 ) . Transformed tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) pollen grains were observed 6 hours after transformation with a Zeiss LSM900 laser scanning microscope ( Axio Observer 7 , inverted ) with Airyscan 2 multiplex 4Y mode . A 40x W 1 . 2 NA Plan Apochromat objective was used during image acquisition . Images were acquired in ZEN blue using the smart set up configured the light paths for TagYFP and mCherry . Time - lapse of tobacco pollen tubes was acquired for 30 - 90s . Analysis of plasma membrane intensities was performed in Fiji . A region of interest ( ROI ) was selected with the “Segmented line” tool over the plasma membrane region of the middle section of the pollen tube for each time point . For each time point , the AtEH1 ( green ) and biosensor ( red ) channel intensities were plotted . An offset distance value was manually calculated for each time point to align each time point to the centre of the pollen tube tip . The combined average of each channel was calculated from a total of 10 images . Yeast expression Fission yeast strain LD328 was used in this study and general methods to transform into fission yeast cells were as previously described ( Gietz , 2014 ) . Briefly , the plasmids were linearized with NotI restriction enzyme . Yeast cells were cultured by YES medium at 30°C , 200 rpm until OD 600 to 0 . 4 - 0 . 8 , harvested the cells by centrifugation and washed three times with sterile water . Transformation mix ( 240 µL 50 % PEG3350 , 36 µL 1 . 0 M LiAc , 50 µL single - stranded carrier DNA ( 2 . 0 mg / mL ) ) was added to 34 µl linearized plasmid DNA , cells were resuspended by vortexing , and were incubated in a 42°C water bath for 40 min . Transformants were plated on EMM + HT medium ( EMM medium supplemented with 45mg / L histidine and 15 µM thiamine ) . After 3 days , colonies were transferred to EMM + H ( EMM medium supplemented with 45mg / L histidine ) plates and observed by Zeiss LSM880 confocal laser microscope using a 100× objective . In vitro protein expression and purification All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells . Briefly , protein expression was induced by 0 . 5 mM isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 18 h at 18 ℃ . Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed with buffer A ( 40 mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol ) . The bacteria were lysed by sonication and the supernatant was flowed through a column packed with Ni - NTA . Proteins were eluted with buffer B ( 40 mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl , 500 mM Imidazole ) and purified with a Superdex 200 increase 10 / 300 column . Proteins were stored in buffer C ( 40 mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) at - 80°C . For the phase separation experiments in vitro , MBP - EH1 ( FL ) - GFP , MBP - EH1 ( ∆ IDR3 ) - GFP and MBP - EH1 ( ∆ CC ∆ IDR3 ) - GFP was cleaved with TEV protease for 3 hours to remove MBP tag . Proteins were diluted to the desired concentrations in different concentration of NaCl . Droplets in 384 - well plate were observed by Zeiss LSM880 confocal laser microscope using a ×63 objective . For the co - localization experiments in vitro , 5 µM EH1 ( FL ) - GFP after MBP cleaved and 5 µM mCherry - TOL6 were mixed with buffer ( 40 mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl ) and incubated on ice for 30 min . Droplets in 384 - well plate were observed as described previously . GFP was excited at 488 nm and detected at 491 - 535 nm , mCherry was excited at 561 nm and detected at 579 - 650 nm . 17 TurboID proximity labelling PSB - D A . thaliana cell suspension cultures were transformed with the AtEH1 - linker - TurboID and experiments were performed as previously described ( Arora et al . , 2020 ) . The TPLATE - linker - TurboID dataset was described before ( Arora et al . , 2020 ) . To calculate enrichment scores , the datasets were compared to a large set of in - house TurboID experiments using unrelated baits performed using the same conditions . Proteins identified in at least two experiments , which did not occur in the background list , and showed a high ( at least 20 - fold ) enrichment score ( NSAF ratio × −log ( P value ) ) versus the large dataset were considered enriched . Analysis of disorder and prion - like regions For sequence analysis of individual proteins ; prion - like residues were obtained using the PLAAC online tool with a core length of 60 and ‘relative weighting of background probabilities’ of 100 . Prediction of disordered residues ( MobiDB consensus scores ) were obtained for the A . thaliana proteome ( NCBI taxon ID 3702 ) on 2021 - 08 - 31 . The A . thaliana proteome of prion - like sequences was obtained from previous work ( Chakrabortee et al . , 2016 ; Powers et al . , 2019 ) . For the classification of endocytic proteins ( Figure 4B ) ; proteins were considered disordered if they had a MobiDB consensus score above 0 . 15 ( 15 % disordered residues ) , and prion - like if they contained a prion - domain ( ≥ 60 amino acids ) identified in either of the previous published datasets ( Chakrabortee et al . , 2016 ; Powers et al . , 2019 ) . CLEM - ET The CLEM approach was performed similarly to previously described with minor modifications ( Chambaud et al . , 2022 ) . For the CLEM - ET of AtEH1 condensates , a small part from the bottom of the hypocotyl was cut from 4 - day old A . thaliana seedlings stably expressing 35S : AtEH1 - GFP . For the rapamycin experiments , seedlings were first treated with 2 . 5 µM rapamycin for 2 hours in 6 well plates with gentle shaking , and then a small region of the root tip was excised . Root or hypocotyl samples were quickly frozen in a Leica EM - PACT high - pressure freezer using 20 % BSA as a cryoprotectant . Freeze - substitution was performed with a Leica AFS 2 in acetone containing 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate . Samples were embedded in HM20 Lowicryl resin . 150nm ultra - thin sections were cut using a Leica Ultracut microtome with a diamond knife ( Biel , Switzerland ) and placed on copper mesh grids . EM grids were imaged before ET by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan confocal microscope with a 63× apochromatic N . A 1 . 4 oil objective . Transmission electron microscopy observations were carried out on a FEI TECNAI Spirit 120 kV electron microscope equipped with an Eagle 4Kx4K CCD camera . Correlation between fluorescence and electron microscope images was performed using the ec - CLEM plugin in Icy software . For hypocotyl samples , chloroplasts and vacuoles were used as landmarks for registration . For the root samples , cell edges were used as landmarks . Electron tomography was performed as previously described ( Nicolas et al . , 2018 ) . Briefly , 5 nm gold beads were briefly applied to grids on both sides and used as fiducials for tomography . Tilt series were acquired from - 65° to 65° at 1 - degree increments . Pixel size was 0 . 28 nm or 0 . 39 nm at 4096x4096 for AtEH1 - GFP condensates and rapamycin experiments , respectively . To acquire dual axis tomograms the grid was rotated 90° . The raw tilt series were aligned and reconstructed using the fiducial alignment mode with the eTomo software in IMOD . 10 to 25 fiducials were selected to accurately align images . Reconstruction was performed using the back - projection with SIRT - like filter ( 10 - 50 iterations ) in IMOD . 18 Segmentation and visualisation of EM tomograms Ribosomes were segmented from tomograms using a pixel and object classification workflow in Ilastik . Ribosomes were manually annotated in 3D using the pixel classification with all available features selected . The resulting probability map was smoothed in 3D ( σ = 3 . 5 ) , and a size filter was applied to remove incorrectly annotated ribosomes . The probability map was further refined using object classification with object features selected ( excluding location features ) to remove incorrectly classified ribosomes . Because of slight differences between contrast between different samples , we performed the segmentation process for individual samples , and applied the resulting classification model to other tomograms using batch processing . Ribosome object predictions were imported into Amira as 8 - bit labels together with ET tomography files . Mitochondria and clathrin - coated vesicles were manually segmented in Amira . Confocal microscopy Unless otherwise indicated , all images were acquired using a PerkinElmer Ultraview spinning - disk system , attached to a Nikon Ti inverted microscope , and operated using the Volocity software package . Images were acquired on an ImagEM CCD camera ( Hamamatsu C9100 - 13 ) using frame - sequential imaging with a 60x water immersion objective ( NA = 1 . 20 ) . Specific excitation and emission were performed using a 488 nm laser combined with a single band pass filter ( 500 - 550 nm ) for GFP in single camera mode . RFP was visualized using 561 nm laser excitation and a 570 - 625 nm band pass filter . Exposure time was between 25 - 500 ms . For the analysis of AtEH1 truncations or mutations in tobacco the relative saturation concentration was obtained by quantifying the mean cytosolic signal after subtraction of background signal . The partitioning assay quantification was performed using the MitoTally script using regions of interests determined from AtEH1 positive foci ( Winkler et al . , 2021 ) . Whole - mount immunofluorescence imaging Roots from 4 - day - old Arabidopsis seedlings were analysed by immunofluorescence as previously described using an InsituPro Vsi II ( Intavis ) automated system ( Sauer et al . , 2006 ) . Antibody dilutions were used as follows : rabbit anti - AtEH1 [ 1 : 600 ] , rabbit anti - CHC [ 1 : 300 ] , mouse anti - RFP [ 1 : 300 ] , Alexa488 - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG [ 1 : 600 ] , Cy3 - conjugated anti - mouse IgG [ 1 : 600 ] . FM4 - 64 uptake imaging and analysis Whole 5 - day - old seedlings were incubated with 2 µM FM4 - 64 ( Invitrogen ) solution in half - strength MS liquid medium without sucrose at room temperature for 15 min . Samples were briefly washed twice with ½ MS before imaging . Images were acquired using the Leica SP8X system using a ×40 W 1 . 2 NA objective using 488 nm laser excitation , and collection from 650nm - 750nm . The ratio of plasma membrane signal and cytosolic signal were calculated using an automated detection macro in ImageJ ‘detect _ membrane _ and _ cytoplasm _ from _ a _ roi . ijm’ ( Grones et al . , 2022 ) , using a threshold set to 60 . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) Tobacco cells transiently expressing proteins were incubated with Latrunculin B ( 4 μM ) for 30 minutes prior to imaging to inhibit condensate movement . FRAP was performed on the spinning disk system using the Ultraview PhotoKinesis unit . Three individual spots were bleached simultaneously , using the ‘stamp’ tool in Volocity to select a square region of 6x6 µm . Bleaching was performed using 100 % of the 488 laser for 3s , and post - bleach acquisition was performed every 0 . 6 seconds for 120 seconds . Fluorescence intensity signal from the condensate was measured by tracking using Trackmate to correct for minor sample drift in x and y axis . Samples which drifted in the z - axis were excluded from 19 analysis . Analysis was performed using the easyFRAP online web tool , using the condensate signal as the ‘region of interest’ , an unbleached region as the ‘whole cell area’ , and a background region as the ‘background’ . The full scale normalisation method was used , and curves were fitted using the double exponential equation . For the 2in1 ratiometric FRAP experiment , AtEH1 WT and mutant reporters were expressed from a single T - DNA . FRAP image acquisition parameters were the same as above , except images were acquired sequentially at 1 second per two - channel frame . The t 1 / 2 times from easyFRAP from GFP and mCherry were divided to get a t 1 / 2 ratio ( GFP / mCherry ) . The absolute t 1 / 2 values obtained from tobacco experiments are highly variable between samples due to differences in expression levels and cell concentrations . However , the t 1 / 2 ratio was relatively consistent despite large differences in absolute t 1 / 2 times . To generate visually comparable FRAP curves ( Figure 7C ) , we therefore selected 8 samples from each condition binned to a t 1 / 2 time of 17 . 2 seconds and plotted the resulting curve using easyFRAP . For the FRAP experiments in vitro , MBP - EH1 ( FL ) - GFP was cleaved with TEV protease for 3 hours to remove MBP tag . EH1 - FL protein was diluted into 10 µM at 100 mM NaCl . After 30 min of incubation on ice , droplets were bleached with a 488 - nm laser pulse ( 3 repeat , 100 % intensity ) on Zeiss LSM880 confocal laser microscope using a ×63 objective . Fluorescence recovery was recorded every 2 s for 400 s after bleaching . Images were acquired using ZEN software . Using Fiji / ImageJ to analyse the fluorescence intensity of recovery . Condensate tracking Tracking of condensate fusion ( Figure 1D ) , FRAP ( Figure 1E , 7C ) and mobility ( Figure 3C and S3A ) was performed using the Trackmate using the DoG detection algorithm . For the FRAP assay , the ‘extract track stack’ feature in Trackmate was used to generate the individual images . Endocytosis imaging and quantification of lifetime Endocytosis dynamics were imaged on UltraView spinning - disk system using a Nikon Perfect Focus System ( PFSIII ) for Z - drift compensation . Images of root epidermal cells of 4 - day old seedlings expressing pEH1 : EH1 - GFP were acquired using a 100x oil - immersion objective ( Plan Apo , NA = 1 . 45 ) , with scan settings set at ‘High Speed’ . Movies were acquired at 2 frames per second for a duration of 5 minutes . We excluded cells with very high density , or high background signal as the signal - to - noise ratio was too low for automated quantitative analysis . We imaged epidermal cells within 1 - 4 cells from the root hair initiation , due to having best S / N ratio here . For post - processing images in ImageJ were first combined to 1 frame / second using a grouped Z - projection ( SUM intensity ) , cropped to include only the plasma membrane region in focus , contrast adjusted using the ‘auto’ function , then converted to 8bit . Quantitation of images using a modified cmeAnalysis script ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) ( Johnson et al . , 2021 ) . Tracking parameters ( cmeAnalysisTrackingAndDetection ) were modified from default parameters as follows to improve tracking accuracy : TrackingGapLength [ 1 ] , TrackingRadius [ 1 2 ] . Surface rendering of condensates Time - lapse images of AtEH1 IDR mutant condensates in N . benthamiana were acquired with the spinning disk system using a 60x objective using a 1 . 5x additional zoom with scan settings set at ‘High 20 Speed’ . Z - stacks were acquired using 15 slices ( 0 . 5 µm spacing ) at 2 . 54 seconds per stack , for a total duration of 4 minutes . Sa mple drift was corrected in 3D using the ‘Correct 3D drift’ plugin in Fiji . Images were imported into Imaris , and condensates were segmented using the ‘spots’ tool , coloured by ‘Sphericity’ . Note that the condensates in N . benthamiana have reduced sphericity in 3D due to being pressed between the plasma membrane and the vacuole ( which occupies the majority of the cellular volume ) . b - isox enrichment 5 - day old Col - 0 seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen , and total proteins extraction and subsequent b - isox enrichment were performed as previously described ( Zhang et al . , 2022 ) . SDS – PAGE and immunoblotting For pEH1 - AtEH1 - GFP samples : Samples with 1× Laemmli loading buffer ( BioRad ) and 1× NuPage reducing agent ( Invitrogen ) were heated for 10 min at 95 °C . Samples were loaded and separated on a 4 – 20 % SDS – PAGE TGX gel ( BioRad ) and subsequently blotted on polyvinylidenedifluoride ( PVDF ; BioRad ) . Membranes were blocked overnight at 4C in 5 % skimmed milk in PBS - T . Next , the blots were incubated with the primary antibodies ( α - TPLATE ( Yperman et al . , 2021b ) , 1 : 1000 ] , α - AtEH1 / Pan1 ( Grones et al . , 2022 ) , 1 : 1000 ] , α - CHC [ Agrisera , AS 10690 , 1 : 2000 ] , α - Tubulin [ Sigma - Aldrich , T5168 , 1 : 5000 ] and secondary antibodies ( α - rabbit - HRP [ Cytiva , NA934 , 1 : 10000 ] , α - mouse - HRP [ Cytiva , NA931 , 1 : 10000 ] ) in 3 % skimmed milk in PBST for 1 h . HRP - conjugated antibodies were detected using western lighting plus - ECL reagent ( Perkin elmer ) . Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis To identify AtEH1 / Pan1 homologues , predicted proteins of selected genomes from the Phytozome v13 database were searched using the BLASTP algorithm with Arabidopsis AtEH1 as an input sequence . Multiple sequence alignment was constructed with the MAFFT algorithm in the einsi mode . Phylogenetic analysis was carried out utilizing PhyML v3 . 0 with the smart model selection . The phylogenetic tree was visualized using iTOL v6 . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism . Data was tested for normality for analysis . Significance criterion was set at a p value of < 0 . 05 .
