Pollard , Yale University , New Haven , CT , and approved September 6 , 2007 ( received for review May 21 , 2007 ) Vesicular trafﬁcking and actin dynamics on Golgi membranes are both regulated by ADP - ribosylation factor 1 ( ARF1 ) through the recruitment of various effectors , including vesicular coats . Actin assembly on Golgi membranes contributes to the architecture of the Golgi complex , vesicle formation , and trafﬁcking and is medi - ated by ARF1 through a cascade that leads to Arp2 / 3 complex activation . Here we addressed the role of Golgi actin downstream of ARF1 by using a biomimetic assay consisting of liposomes of deﬁned lipid composition , carrying an activated form of ARF1 incubated in cytosolic cell extracts . We observed actin polymeriza - tion around the liposomes resulting in thick actin shells and actin comet tails that pushed the ARF1 liposomes forward . The assay was used to characterize the ARF1 - dependent pathway , leading to actin polymerization , and conﬁrmed a dependency on CDC42 and its downstream effector N - WASP . Overall , this study demonstrates that actin polymerization driven by the complex multicomponent signaling cascade of the Golgi apparatus can be reproduced with a biomimetic system . Moreover , our results are consistent with the view that actin - based force generation at the site of vesicle formation contributes to the mechanism of ﬁssion . In addition to its well established function in coat recruitment , the ARF1 machin - ery also might produce movement - and ﬁssion - promoting forces through actin polymerization . transport vesicle (cid:2) Golgi (cid:2) membrane scission (cid:2) motility (cid:2) CDC42 I ntracellular traffic is mediated by transport vesicles that bud from a donor membrane through the assembly of specific coat proteins and are then transported and fused with the acceptor organelle ( 1 , 2 ) . One important , yet not fully understood , step of vesicle formation is the fission and separation of the transport carrier from the donor compartment . Extensive studies mostly focusing on the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles during endocytosis from the plasma membrane revealed the facilitating role of actin polymerization for the pinching off of vesicles and their movement away from the donor membrane ( 3 ) . In the secretory pathway , it is not yet clear whether actin fulfills the same role . However , fundamental similarities between the reg - ulation of actin assembly at the plasma membrane and on Golgi subcompartments have been uncovered ( 4 , 5 ) . Besides its im - plication in the maintenance of Golgi architecture , the actin cytoskeleton might play a role in the biogenesis of Golgi - derived transport vesicles ( 6 – 8 ) , just as actin dynamics is coupled to the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles and cargo exit from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) ( 9 , 10 ) and subsequent trafficking in the early secretory pathway ( 11 – 13 ) . Roles for Golgi coat proteins , namely coat protein I ( COPI ) and clathrin coats , in the control of actin cytoskeleton dynamics have been documented , connecting the mechanism of vesicle formation to the actin cytoskeleton ( 9 , 11 , 12 ) . Recruitment of COPI and clathrin coat – protein complexes on Golgi subcom - partments is regulated by the small GTP - binding protein ADP - ribosylation factor 1 ( ARF1 ) , and ARF1 has been shown to regulate actin dynamics on Golgi membranes ( 14 ) . ARF1 - mediated recruitment of COPI on cis - medial Golgi compart - ments triggers Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin polymerization in a cascade that involves the Rho GTPase CDC42 and its downstream effector , N - WASP ( 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 ) . Although not completely understood , the mechanism of CDC42 association to Golgi membranes may involve the binding of CDC42 to the COPI (cid:1) - subunit ( 15 ) . In addition , it was recently found that GTP - ARF1 on the Golgi complex recruits a CDC42 GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) , ARHGAP21 , which further regulates CDC42 activity and Arp2 / 3 complex dynamics on Golgi mem - branes ( 17 , 18 ) . Whether and how ARF1 - mediated assembly of clathrin - coated vesicles is coupled to actin dynamics on the TGN is less clear . It was recently reported that activated ARF1 triggers the recruitment of a cortactin / dynamin - 2 complex to Golgi membranes with consequences for post - Golgi transport ( 10 ) . This pathway downstream of ARF1 would couple Arp2 / 3 com - plex activation by cortactin to the stimulation of vesicle fission by dynamin - 2 ( 10 ) . In addition , ARF1 is known to promote the production of phosphoinositides , PtdIns 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) , and PtdIns 4 , 5 - biphosphate ( PI4 , 5P2 ) at the Golgi complex and , hence , to affect both actin dynamics and membrane traffic ( 19 ) . These observations suggest that ARF1 - regulated actin dynamics contribute to the trafficking of Golgi - derived vesicles by facili - tating the formation and possibly the dissociation of transport carriers from Golgi subcompartments . Here we designed an in vitro reconstituted system analyzing the role of ARF1 - dependent actin dynamics on liposomes . This system is composed of lipid vesicles of defined composition , to which ARF1 is bound . GDP - ARF1 is soluble , but it binds to membrane in its GTP - bound form by its myristoylated amphi - pathic helix , allowing liposomes to be readily functionalized by GTP - ARF1 in vitro . In practice , GTP - (cid:1) - S , a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP , was used to stabilize the association of ARF1 to liposomes . These liposomes were incubated in HeLa cell ex - tracts , as opposed to purified protein mixes , because the required components of ARF1 - dependent actin dynamics are not yet fully identified . Under these conditions , liposomes promoted actin assembly at their surface in an ARF1 - dependent manner and moved by the polymerization of an actin comet tail . This assay allowed for the characterization of the biochemical pathway Authorcontributions : P . C . andC . S . contributedequallytothiswork ; P . C . andC . S . designed research ; J .

Results ARF1 Liposomes . Liposomes were prepared from a mixture of synthetic lipids for a simple and well controlled system . Unless otherwise indicated , they consisted of 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) with 1 % 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - biphosphate ( PIP2 ) because PIP2 is known to regulate the architecture of the Golgi complex down - stream of ARF1 ( 20 , 21 ) . Liposomes of different sizes were obtained by using two different techniques . Giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) , 1 to 20 (cid:2) m in diameter , formed by the gentle swelling method ( 22 ) were used for microscopy observations and quantification of actin polymerization by epifluorescence . Large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) , 0 . 8 (cid:2) m in diameter , formed by the extrusion method ( 23 ) were generally used for biochemical characterization . To bind ARF1 to liposomes , we made use of its natural property to insert into membranes upon GTP loading ( 24 ) . For this purpose , recombinant - purified , myristoylated GDP - ARF1 was loaded with the nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP , GTP - (cid:1) - S , at a low - Mg 2 (cid:1) concentration in the presence of liposomes , and insertion was verified by sedimentation analysis [ see supporting information ( SI ) Fig . 4 ] . GTP - ARF1 Induces Actin Shell and Comet Formation . GUVs loaded with GTP - (cid:1) - S - ARF1 ( ARF1 - GUVs ) were incubated in HeLa cell extract supplemented with G - actin ( including 5 % fluores - cently labeled actin ) and ATP . An actin shell , visible as a dark ring by phase - contrast microscopy or a fluorescent ring by epifluorescence microscopy , was detected around the liposomes as early as 5 min after adding liposomes to the extract . The thickness of the actin gel increased progressively around the GUVs as a function of time ( Fig . 1 A – C ) . In some cases , after 2 to 3 h , the actin gel growth led to the disappearance of the vesicle , producing a homogeneous ball of actin gel ( Fig . 1 D ) . Because (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) M residual - free GTP - (cid:1) - S was present in the liposome preparation , a control was performed by using GUVs that were preincubated in GTP - (cid:1) - S without ARF1 . These GUVs never developed an actin gel ( Fig . 1 E and F ) ( the exposure of the fluorescent images is enhanced 10 times compared with Fig . 1 A – D ) , although faint patches of fluorescent actin could be seen at the periphery of some of these GUVs ( Fig . 1 F ) . To quantify the extent of actin polymerization around ARF1 - GUVs , the mean actin fluorescence intensity in the fluorescent ring around randomly selected GUVs was measured 30 – 45 min after mixing with the extract , as described in Material and Methods ( Fig . 2 ) . Then (cid:2) 95 % of ARF1 - GUVs displayed a pronounced fluores - cent signal ( Fig . 2 A1 ) , contrasting with control GUVs preincu - bated with GTP - (cid:1) - S without ARF1 ( Fig . 2 A2 ) . We conclude that the residual GTP - (cid:1) - S left in the assay is not sufficient to trigger actin polymerization in the absence of ARF1 . Actin comets visible by phase - contrast microscopy were ob - served on 18 % of ARF1 - GUVs ( 66 comets for 376 GUVs ) and correlated with movement of these GUVs ( Fig . 1 G ) . Of note , comets were never observed for GUVs of (cid:2) 2 (cid:2) m in diameter , an observation that is consistent with experiments on beads ( 25 ) . The average speed of rocketing liposomes was 0 . 52 (cid:3) 0 . 30 (cid:2) m / min ( n (cid:4) 20 ) , comparable to Arp2 / 3 - mediated movement in other in vitro systems ( 26 ) . Actin comet - based movement was similarly observed with LUVs , on which ARF1 was bound ( Fig . 1 H ) . To confirm that the formation of actin shells and comets was the result of de novo barbed - end actin polymerization , and not because of recruitment of preexisting actin filaments from the extract , the assay was carried out in the presence of 0 . 1 to 2 (cid:2) M cytochalasin D , which is an inhibitor of actin polymerization at barbed ends in this concentration range ( 27 ) . The amount of actin present around ARF1 - GUVs was significantly reduced in the presence of the drug at (cid:4) 0 . 5 (cid:2) M ( P (cid:5) 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 2 B ) . This inhibition , together with the observed propulsion of small lipo - somes by actin tails , showed that barbed - end actin polymeriza - tion , and not recruitment of preexisting filaments , was occurring around ARF1 liposomes , and that actin dynamics were able to generate a propulsive force . To address whether the presence of PIP2 was important for the production of actin at the membrane , we used ARF1 - GUVs composed of 96 % DOPC and 4 % phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) . Thus , these vesicles lacked PIP2 , but bore the same electrostatic charge as the standard 1 % PIP2 - containing ARF1 - GUVs . When DOPC - PI liposomes were mixed with HeLa cell extracts , we observed a shell of actin , although it was markedly reduced compared with standard 1 % PIP2 - containing ARF1 - GUVs ( compare Fig . 2 A3 and A1 ) , demonstrating that PIP2 is required for optimal ARF1 - dependent polymerization of actin around liposomes . When standard ( 1 % PIP2 ) ARF1 - GUVs were incu - bated in buffer containing G - actin and ATP without extract , no Fig . 1 . ActinpolymerizingaroundARF1liposomesproducesactinshellsand comets .

Thus far , these results indicate that the presence of activated ARF1 on synthetic liposome membranes triggered actin poly - merization and movement . To provide additional evidence for the dependency of ARF1 in our system , we made use of our recent finding that ARHGAP21 , a CDC42 GAP regulating actin dynamics on Golgi , associates with Golgi membranes through the interaction of its central ARF - binding domain ( ARFBD ) with GTP - bound ARF1 ( 17 ) . Addition of 0 . 1 or 1 (cid:2) M purified recombinant GST - tagged ARFBD to the assay resulted in a dose - dependent inhibition of actin polymerization on ARF1 - GUVs , compared with 1 (cid:2) M GST alone ( Fig . 2 C ) . Our inter - pretation of these data are that ARHGAP21 - ARFBD , which binds GTP - bound ARF1 with a high affinity ( K d (cid:6) 50 nM ) ( 18 ) , prevents further activation of effector pathways involved in actin polymerization downstream of ARF1 . Overall , our data demonstrate the absolute requirement of GTP - ARF1 for actin polymerization around liposomes and the necessity of cytosolic factors , most probably proteins , to support actin polymerization downstream of ARF1 . ARF1 - Dependent Actin Polymerization Requires CDC42 and N - WASP . Although the machinery regulating actin dynamics on Golgi membranes is far from understood , it is now clear that ARF1 plays a critical role in Golgi actin assembly through the control of a cascade leading to CDC42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex acti - vation ( 11 , 12 , 28 ) . We checked that this activation was at work in our assay by immunoblotting for CDC42 on liposomes sedi - mented by centrifugation . This experiment revealed that , com - pared with naked LUVs , ARF1 - LUVs recruited significantly higher amounts of CDC42 from the cytosolic extract , and this finding correlated with increased association of F - actin with LUVs ( SI Fig . 5 ) . Because CDC42 has been shown to play a role in actin polymerization downstream of ARF1 on isolated Golgi mem - branes ( 11 , 12 ) , we characterized the role of CDC42 in our ARF1 - liposome assay as follows . Specific inhibitors of the CDC42 cascade were added to the polymerization assay , and the actin shell around ARF1 - GUVs was quantified as before . Se - cramine , a recently described specific inhibitor of CDC42 shown to block traffic of secreted proteins out of the Golgi complex ( 29 ) , was first added to the assay at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 (cid:2) M . The addition of 1 (cid:2) M secramine was sufficient to significantly reduce ARF1 - dependent actin polymerization ( P (cid:5) 0 . 006 ) ( Fig . 3 A ) . In addition , the CDC42 / Rac interactive binding ( CRIB ) region of PAK - 1 , which binds GTP - bound CDC42 ( and Rac1 ) ( 30 ) , was purified as a GST - fusion protein and added to the assay at concentrations ranging from 0 . 25 to 2 (cid:2) M . Signif - icant inhibition of actin polymerization around ARF1 - GUVs was already observed at the lowest concentration of PAK - CRIB domain used ( 0 . 25 (cid:2) M ) ( Fig . 3 B ) . These results revealed that GTP - bound ARF1 on liposomes was able to trigger a cascade leading to CDC42 activation and , hence , to actin polymerization . In its GTP - bound state , CDC42 binds directly to N - WASP , relieving N - WASP autoinhibition and allowing N - WASP to activate the actin polymerization nucleating capacity of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 31 ) .

Addition of 10 (cid:2) M Wiskostatin significantly inhibited actin polymerization at the surface of ARF1 - GUVs ( P (cid:5) 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 3 C ) , indicating that ARF1 acts upstream of a well established CDC42 / N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 cascade ( 33 ) , leading to actin polymerization . These findings demonstrate that membrane - bound ARF1 is competent for triggering CDC42 recruitment and activity , leading to N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin polymerization . Role of Actin Dynamics in Membrane Remodeling in Vitro . Because our ARF1 - reconstitution assay reproduced the signaling cascade dissected in cellular systems , it provided a good tool for studying membrane deformations induced by the presence of ARF1 . Two types of membrane reorganization were observed : liposomes carrying a comet tail or balls of actin with no enclosed volume ( see Fig . 1 D – F ) . Liposomes with comets were observed 30 to 45 min after the start of actin polymerization and underwent motion by actin comet growth during the 30 min . Balls of actin appeared upon longer incubation times ( (cid:4) 2 h ) and were pre - ceded by actin shell growth around the liposomes . Note that balls of actin were in the range of several micrometers in diameter and were thus bigger than the liposomes supporting comet growth ( (cid:5) 2 (cid:2) m in diameter ) . Liposome separation ( i . e . , one part of the vesicle moving away from the other part by the growth of an actin comet ) was observed on ARF1 - GUVs on rare occasions ( see SI Movie 1 ) . These events occurred on vesicles with an unusual oblate shape and an asymmetric actin shell . Discussion Our data demonstrate that the ARF1 cascade leads to actin polymerization by CDC42 activation and further triggering of N - WASP and likely the Arp2 / 3 complex at the cytosol / membrane interface . In addition , GTP - ARF1 appears to be indispensable for actin polymerization on DOPC / PIP2 GUVs , somewhat contrasting with previous findings that liposomes containing phosphoinositides could produce actin comets in cell extracts ( 34 ) . However , it should be noted that these experiments used liposomes with different lipid composition ( equal amounts of PI and PC and 4 – 33 % PIP2 ) incubated in different extracts ( Xenopus eggs instead of HeLa cells ) ( 34 ) . Another important finding from our study is that the effect of several CDC42 inhibitors , including the Golgi - associated , CDC42 - specific GAP , ARHGAP21 ( 17 ) , clearly demonstrates that activation of CDC42 ( GTP - loading ) downstream of ARF1 is indispensable for actin polymerization , and that this step can be reconstituted at the surface of liposomes incubated in cytosolic extracts in vitro . This finding is interesting given that the mechanisms leading to CDC42 activation on Golgi subcompartments downstream of ARF1 are not understood . The COPI could provide a link between ARF1 and CDC42 because it is recruited on the Golgi by binding to ARF1 and it is known to interact with GTP - bound CDC42 ( 11 , 15 ) . However , COPI alone is probably not directly responsible for CDC42 activation because replacement of GDP for GTP on Rho proteins requires specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) . The larger family of Rho GEFs is the Dbl - related GEFs that comprise 69 distinct members in humans ( 35 ) .

Whether these or other Rho GEFs are involved in CDC42 activation and regulation of actin dynamics on Golgi subcom - partments is presently unknown . Moreover , the inhibition of ARF1 - dependent actin polymerization by secramine ( Fig . 3 A ) is a further indication that this in vitro system is able to reconstitute the full activation cascade of Cdc42 . Indeed , in vitro secramine was shown to inhibit binding of Cdc42 to membranes in a RhoGDI - dependent manner ( 29 ) . Therefore , this drug is thought to inhibit RhoGDI - dependent shuttling of GDP - bound Cdc42 between the cytosol and the target membrane , where GEF - assisted GDP / GTP exchange takes place . Finally , the inhibition of actin polymerization on GUVs we observed in the presence of the ARF1 - binding domain of ARHGAP21 ( ARFBD ) is likely due to binding to GTP - ARF1 and compet - itive displacement of cytosolic ARF1 effectors required for actin assembly . We previously reported that expression of ARFBD in cells displaces ARF1 effectors such as AP - 1 and COPI from the Golgi complex ( 17 ) . This assumption also is supported by the nanomolar - range binding affinity of ARFBD for GTP - bound ARF1 ( K d (cid:6) 50 nM ) ( 18 ) . In addition , we observed a further significant inhibition of actin polymerization in the presence of ARFBD fused with the RhoGAP domain of ARHGAP21 ( see SI Fig . 6 ) . This effect might be due to RhoGAP - stimulated GTP hydrolysis on CDC42 associated with ARF1 - GUVs and hence inhibition of CDC42 - dependent actin polymerization . Our findings that an unidentified CDC42 - GEF is involved downstream of ARF1 in activating CDC42 on Golgi membranes , together with our previous observations that ARF1 recruits the CDC42 - GAP ARHGAP21 protein on the Golgi complex ( 17 ) , indicate that ARF1 is able to control the full GDP / GTP cycle of CDC42 , and hence regulates actin dynamics on Golgi mem - branes . The availability of an in vitro system supporting a complex multicomponent signaling cascade leading to CDC42 activation downstream of ARF1 should help to clarify the implication of upstream regulators in the activation of CDC42 on Golgi membranes . It is important to note that the positive influence of COPI on the recruitment of CDC42 could only account for actin poly - merization on cis - medial Golgi cisternae , and not on the trans - side of the Golgi complex , the TGN , where ARF1 is known to control vesicle budding through clathrin and adaptor proteins , APs and GGAs ( 14 ) . However , roles for CDC42 for exit of cargos out of the TGN also have been described ( 38 ) , and additional mechanisms must exist to ensure CDC42 - dependent actin polymerization on the TGN . In the endocytic pathway , CDC42 activity is regulated by the intersectin families of CDC42 GEFs , which also bind to N - WASP and are part of a core complex composed of dynamin , cortactin , ABP1 , and syndapin involved in clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( 3 , 39 , 40 ) . A homo - logue complex consisting of syndapin II and dynamin II pro - motes vesicle formation at the TGN ( 41 ) . Whether this complex is linked to the ARF1 / cortactin / dynamin pathway regulating post - Golgi transport ( 5 , 10 ) and to CDC42 activity is presently unknown . Analyzing the stresses and forces developed during actin polymerization allows us to understand the formation of either actin comet tails or balls of actin in our assay ( see SI Discussion for a more complete analysis ) . We know from previous studies on polystyrene beads that the growth of an actin gel through Arp2 / 3 nucleation generates stresses inside the gel that lead to gel rupture and bead rocketing ( 42 ) . On liposomes , which are water - permeable , forces developed during actin polymerization create an osmotic pressure difference that can lead to membrane rupture and solute leakage . Two scenarios can be imagined : Either the stress in the actin gel produces a comet - propelled liposome before pressure is too high to create solute leakage or the liposome leaks and shrinks slowly while actin continues polymerizing , thus producing balls of actin with no detectable liposome . The osmotic pressure at which the vesicle leaks depends inversely on the radius ( see SI Discussion ) . Therefore , larger liposomes are more likely to leak , whereas smaller lipo - somes are more stable and allow comet formation to occur , which is what we see in our experiments . Although balls of actin are probably not relevant in the Golgi , smaller liposomes propulsed by comets are reminiscent of what is observed when vesicles bud from the Golgi . We show in our assay that movement of liposomes carrying ARF1 can be trig - gered by actin polymerization . The force generated during this process has been well characterized in Arp2 / 3 - based assays ( 43 – 46 ) , and this force can lead to membrane separation , as observed in other Arp2 / 3 - based liposome reconstitution assays where actin - associated vesicles were observed budding from larger membrane masses ( 43 , 44 ) . Actin polymerization might not be the sole factor responsible for vesicle separation . How - ever , we propose that actin polymerization mediated by ARF1 might help vesicles to transiently pinch off and move away from donor compartments , reminiscent of models proposed for en - docytosis ( 47 , 48 ) . The reconstitution of ARF1 - dependent actin polymerization in a model system paves the way for a better understanding of the mechanism of vesicle dynamics on Golgi membranes . Materials and Methods Materials . Rabbit muscle actin was from Cytoskeleton ( Denver , CO ) , cytochalasin D and GTP - (cid:1) - S were purchased from Sigma – Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) , and Wiskostatin was from Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA ) . Lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) , Alexa Fluor 594 rabbit muscle actin was from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) , and anti - PIP2 antibody fluo - rescein conjugate was from Echelon ( Salt Lake City , UT ) . Secramine was a gift from Eric Macia ( Institut de Pharmacologie Mole´culaire et Cellulaire , Valbonne , France ) . HeLa cell extracts were prepared as described in SI Materials and Methods . Total protein concentration of the extract , as measured by Bradford assay with a BSA standard , was 14 mg / ml . Myristoylated ARF1 was prepared from Escherichia coli - coexpressing bovine ARF1 and yeast N - myristoyltransferase by a procedure described previously ( 24 ) . Purification of GST - fusion protein of the PAK - CRIB and indicated domains of ARHGAP21 has been described previously ( 17 ) . Liposome Preparation . One - to 20 - (cid:2) m - diameter GUVs were pre - pared by the gentle hydration method ( 22 , 49 ) . Three hundred micrograms of lipids solubilized in organic solvent was deposited on a Teflon disk and dried under vacuum for 2 h to ensure complete evaporation of the solvent . The Teflon disk was placed in a beaker , and 10 ml of a 0 . 28 M sucrose solution was carefully added . The liposomes grew spontaneously during an overnight incubation . The (cid:5) 0 . 80 - (cid:2) m - diameter LUVs were prepared by extrusion ( 23 ) . When noted , 2 % NBD - PC was added to the lipids as a fluorescent probe . The difference in optical index between the sucrose solution inside the liposomes and the outside buffer solutions permitted the observation of the liposomes with phase - contrast microscopy . The osmolarity of these solutions was checked to prevent the bursting of the liposomes . Because PIP2 is notoriously difficult to mix with other lipids , we verified its presence by incubating the GUV with fluorescein - labeled anti - PIP2 antibody . ARF1 Binding on Membranes . To bind myr - ARF1 on GUVs , we used a modification of the procedure described in ref . 24 . Thirty microliters of the liposome stock solution were mixed with 30 (cid:2) l of Glu buffer [ 50 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 180 mM D - glucose ] supplemented with 1 . 5 mM final DTT , 350 (cid:2) M final GTP - (cid:1) - S , 1 . 6 (cid:2) M final of purified myr - ARF1 , and 2 . 6 mM 16932 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:3) cgi (cid:3) doi (cid:3) 10 . 1073 (cid:3) pnas . 0704749104 Heuvingh et al . EDTA . GDP / GTP exchange and myr - ARF1 insertion on GUVs were allowed for 45 – 60 min at room temperature , and then 2 . 6 mM MgCl 2 was added . We washed the GUV with Glu buffer by 200 (cid:7) g centrifugation for 20 min to reduce the concentration of free GTP - (cid:1) - S that could interact with other G proteins ( residual GTP - (cid:1) - S concentration (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) M ) . When theARHGAP21 effect was tested , a second centrifugation step was added ( residual GTP - (cid:1) - S final concentration (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) M ) . We prepared ARF1 - LUVs in the same way , except that the concentration of lipo - somes was 0 . 25 mg / ml and centrifugation was omitted ( residual GTP - (cid:1) - S concentration (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) M ) . Motility and Polymerization Assay . For motility and polymerization assays , 1 - (cid:2) l extracts were mixed with 1 (cid:2) l of G - actin ( partly labeled ) in G buffer , 1 (cid:2) l of a solution containing ATP , creatin - phosphate and 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ( DABCO ) , and 4 (cid:2) l of ARF1 - GUVs washed in Glu buffer . When drugs or peptide were added to the assay , it was diluted in 1 (cid:2) l of Glu buffer , and 1 (cid:2) l of ARF1 - GUVs was omitted instead . Final concentrations were 2 mg / ml extracts , 3 . 8 (cid:2) M rabbit muscle G - actin , 290 nM Alexa Fluor 594 G - actin , 1 mM ATP , 20 mM creatin - phosphate , and 135 (cid:2) M 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ( DABCO ) . Final salinity was equiv - alent to 80 mM KCl . A higher salinity ( 150 mM KCl ) did not significantly affect the assay ( see SI Fig . 7 ) . GUVs were observed with an IX70 Olympus inverted microscope and an Olympus (cid:7) 100 / N . A . 1 . 35 phase - contrast objective ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . Fluorescent - labeled molecules were excited by a 200 - W mercury lamp ( OSRAM , Munich , Germany ) . Images were recorded with a CCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Trenton , NJ ) driven by Meta - Morph software ( Universal Imaging Corporation , Downingtown , PA ) . Quantification of Actin Polymerization Around GUVs . Fluorescent images were analyzed by using ImageJ software ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) to quantify the amount of fluorescently la - beled actin present around the membrane of the GUVs . Using the plug - in ‘‘Oval Profile Plot , ’’ the maximum intensity value along a radius starting from the center of the GUV was taken . This measure was repeated 360 times by rotating the radius , producing a circumferential profile . The mean value of this profile was taken as a measure of the quantity of actin around a GUV . For each experimental condition , 40 – 70 GUVs were analyzed , and results were gathered in a histogram . Because the distribution of actin quantity was similar to a log - normal law , we used a logarithmic scale for the fluorescence intensity ( i . e . , we distributed the data into bins of exponentially increasing size ) . Different experimental conditions were compared by using a Wilcoxon rank - sum test . Because of some variability in the assay , statistical analysis was performed only on data sets obtained on the same day with the same batch of ARF1 - GUVs and extracts .
