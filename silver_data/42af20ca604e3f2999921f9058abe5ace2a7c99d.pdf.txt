Harrison Gibbs Laboratory Harvard University Cambridge , Massachusetts 02138 Summary We have prepared a homogeneous , soluble 8 . 6s species ( “8 . 6s clathrin” ) from calf - brain coated vesicles . Crosslinking experiments show that this 8 . 6s clathrin is composed of three heavy chains ( molecular weight 180 , 000 ) and three light chains ( molecular weights 33 , 000 and 36 , 000 ) . Each heavy chain is in close contact with a single light chain , and the light chains appear not to be in contact with each other . Intact 8 . 6s clathrin can reassemble into cages without participation of additional protein species . Introduction Clathrin is the principal protein of coated vesicles ( Pearse , 1975 ; 1976 ) . It forms the cagelike coat , a network of hexagons and pentagons about 140 A on a side , that surrounds an internal membrane vesicle ( Crowther et al . , 1976 ) . Several investigators have shown that clathrin , defined as a species of apparent molecular weight 180 , 000 , can be dissociated from the surface of coated vesicles by high concentrations of primary amines ( Keen et al . , 1979 ) urea ( Blitz et al . , 1977 ) or high pH ( Woodward and Roth , 1978 ) . The solubilized protein may be reassembled into cage - like structures with a morphology similar to the exte - rior of intact coated vesicles ( Woodward and Roth , 1978 ; Keen et al . , 1979 ; Schook et al . , 1979 ) . This reassembly constitutes in effect an assay for “native” clathrin . Electron micrographs of the solubilized pro - tein shadowed with platinum and carbon have been obtained by Ungewickell and Branton ( 1981 ) showing images of a threefold symmetric structure with a pin - wheellike shape . This structure appears to be the assembly unit of the cage . We show here by crosslinking experiments that this assembly unit is composed of three heavy chains ( molecular weight 180 , 000 ) and three light chains ( of which there are at least two species , with molecular weights 33 , 000 and 36 , 000 ) . That is , each heavy chain has one tightly bound light chain , and the com - plete unit is a trimer of such pairs . Intact trimeric units seem to be required for rapid assembly of cages . Results Preparation of Homogeneous , 8 . 6s Clathrin Lane 1 of Figure 1 shows the SDS - PAGE pattern of purified clathrin isolated from coated vesicles accord - ing to the procedure described in Experimental Pro - cedures . It shows three bands : a heavy chain ( MO ) with a calculated molecular weight of 180 , 000 , in agreement with previously reported values , and two light chains ( LC , and LC , ) with molecular weights of 36 , 000 and 33 , 000 . No other species is present in significant amount . The same electrophoretic pattern is observed without / 3 - mercaptoethanol ( Figure 1 , lane 2 ) suggesting the absence of interchain disulfide links . The ratio of strength of LC , to LCb is approxi - mately 1 : 2 in all preparations examined . The sedimentation profile in a 5 - 20 % linear sucrose gradient of an aliquot of the same clathrin sample is shown in Figure 2a . There is a single , symmetrical peak . Its sedimentation coefficient is approximately 8 . 6S , as calibrated with bromelain - cleaved hemaglu - tinin and catalase ( 9 . 3s and 11 . 25 respectively , indi - cated by the arrows in Figure 2a ) , and the material is denoted “8 . 6s clathrin” below . This sedimentation profile is characteristic of samples in which all divalent cations have been chelated with either 1 mM EGTA or EDTA , and as a general rule the profile is independent of ionic strength ( up to 1 M NaCI ) , pH ( between 6 . 0 and 8 . 5 ) and buffer ( Na acetate , Tris , MES , PIPES , imidazole , ammonium carbonate and triethanolamine ) . Assembly of Cages from 8 . 6s Clathrin At pH 6 . 2 and at low ionic strength ( such as , 20 mM imidazole or MES ) addition of 2 mM Ca2 + to protein at a concentration of about 0 . 5 mg / ml transforms the 8 . 6s species into a rapidly sedimenting complex ( Fig - ure 2b ) . Electron microscopy shows cagelike struc - tures , varying in diameter from 650 to 1250 A ( Figure 3a ) . A similar association occurs without Ca2 + . if the protein is concentrated fivefold . These cages are evi - dently similar to the exterior of coated vesicles . Above about pH 6 . 7 , Ca’ + IS ineffective in inducing cage formation , and clathrin remains as a 8 . 6s species . Formation of such cages from solubilized clathrin has been described , but without consideration of the light chains , by Keen and collaborators ( 1979 ) . Electron Microscopy of 8 . 6s Clathrin Examples of negatively stained images of individual 8 . 6s clathrin molecules appear in Figure 4 . The struc - ture is composed of three arms , bent at their centers in a uniform way and radiating from a single point of contact with an apparent threefold symmetry . The images show a consistent handedness , indicating that these clathrin molecules tend to adsorb to the carbon film on a single side . The inner part of an arm is about 140 A in length , the outer part about 110 A , and some views show an additional , short stretch at the apical end ( see Figures 4c - 4f ) . The arms appear to be of relatively uniform thickness , between 20 and 40 A . Each arm is about twice the length of a cage , and the angle at the bend is approximately 120” . Striking images of these structures have been obtained by Ungewickell and Branton ( 1981 ) who shadowed mol - ecules deposited from finely divided droplets . They point out that such a pinwheellike shape is called a “triskelion . ” Cell 756 Figure 1 .

The results are qualitatively the same with any of the three reagents although with DTSP they require a lower ratio of reagent / protein for the same extent of crosslinking . Most of the experiments were carried out at pH 8 . 0 - 8 . 5 , and the pattern of crosslinked forms was similar to that observed at pH 6 . 2 with DTSP . Figure 5 displays an example of the crosslinked bands determined by reacting 8 . 6s clathrin with in - creasing amounts of DMS . We refer to these bands as Ml , DO , Di , D2 and T . Ml is readily observed at low concentrations of crosslinker ; its mobility indi - cates a molecular weight of 215 , 000 . The following observations show that this band corresponds to an association of one heavy chain ( MO ) and one light chain ( LCa or L & I . First , there are no bands between the 36 , 000 and 180 , 000 regions of the gel , suggest - ing the absence of dimers or trimers of the light chains . It is therefore unlikely that Ml is an aggregate com - posed solely of light chain ( for example , pentamer or hexamer ) . Second , the appearance of Ml is simulta - neous with the disappearance of the light and heavy chains ( see , for example , Figure 5a line 21 , strongly suggesting a crosslinking event between them . Fi - nally , Ml can be regenerated into light and heavy chains in a ratio similar to that found in noncrosslinked BC c bait orn Figure 2 .

This experiment was done by crosslinking with DTSP ; after separation by SDS - PAGE under nonreducing conditions , it was eluted for 24 hr in sample buffer in the presence of 4 M urea , 3 % / I - mercaptoethanol and 10 mM dithio - threitol and again submitted to electrophoresis , this time in reducing conditions . The molecular weights of bands with lower mobili - ties were estimated by extrapolation of the mobilities of “known” markers : MO , Ml and crosslinked trimers and tetramers of catalase ( 189 , 000 and 252 , 000 re - spectively , see Figure 5b ) . DO , Dl and D2 behave as species of molecular weight 360 , 000 , 395 , 000 and 430 , 000 , suggesting that these forms correspond to the three possible dimer species generated from MO and Ml ( two heavy chains with 0 , 1 and 2 light chains respectively ) . By measuring the relative amounts of DO , Dl and D2 , for any given degree of crosslinking of heavy chains to light chains , we can determine the total number of light chains in an 8 . 6s unit . As de - scribed in the caption to Table 1 , the ratio of stain in the dimer bands can be used , together with the ratio of stain in the monomer bands , to estimate the fraction of heavy chains that have a light chain bound . This method is in principle equivalent to measuring staining ratios of heavy to light chain in a second dimension of electrophoresis after reversal of crosslinking . It has , however , the decisive advantage of using bands of comparable strength and of similar polypeptide com - position ( principally heavy chain , either as monomer or dimer ) rather than bands of very unequal strength and of different composition ( heavy to light chain in Protein Organization in Clathrin Trimers 757 Figure 3 .

Optical density traces of four stained SDS - PAGE gels from independent crosslinking experi - ments with increasing amounts of DMS are given in Figure 5c , and the corrected areas of peaks in Table 1 . Relative amounts of the different dimers agree well with a model in which each heavy chain is in contact with one light chain . T behaves as a species of molecular weight 640 , 000 , that is , a trimer of Mi . No additional bands of lower mobility can be detected with higher amounts of DMS ( see , for example , Figure 5a lane ! ? I ) , even when most of the 8 . 6s clathrin has been crosslinked to T ( in this case we have used DTSP for the extensive crosslinking ; gel not shown ) . Selective Proteolysis of the Light Chains It is possible to digest the light chains completely into peptides smaller than 10 , 000 with elastase in low molar ratio , as given in Figure 1 lane 3 . Under the conditions outlined in the figure caption , the heavy chain remains undigested . Crosslinking of elastase - treated 8 . 6s clathrin ( Figure 5a lane 6 ) shows that heavy - chain contacts in the trimer are still maintained . Band Ml ( one heavy chain linked to one light chain ) has disappeared , and Dl and D2 are absent ; only DO ( dimer of heavy chains ) and T ( trimer ) are clearly seen . Elastase - treated clathrin aggregates in the presence of Ca” , but it appears to have lost the ability to form regular cages ( electron micrograph , Figure 3b ) . Elas - tase treatment of intact cages has no apparent effect on their morphology ( Figure 3c ) , although the light chains have been completely digested ( Figure 1 lane 4 ) . Discussion Purification and Composition of 8 . 6s Clathrin Previous reports of clathrin purification identify a se - ries of bands on gel electrophoresis , many of which can be separated from solubilized clathrin by gel filtration or by centrifugation ( Woodward and Roth , 1978 ; Keen et al . , 1979 ) . The experiments described here show clearly that under all nondenaturing con - ditions examined , only two classes of components are tightly associated : the 180 , 000 molecular weight heavy chain originally designated as clathrin by Pearse ( 1975 ) and the 33 , 000 and 36 , 000 light chains , also observed by Pearse ( 1978 ) in cholate - extracted vesicles . These two components appear to be sufficient for reformation of stable , coated vesiclelike cages in the low ionic strength ( ca 20 mM ) , Ca’ + - containing buffers we employ . No other protein species appear , even in overloaded SDS gels . Moreover , our results suggest that light chains may be required for correct reassembly , since elastase treatment of solubilized clathrin prevents formation of regular cages . We can - not , however , rule out that cleavage of a significant small peptide from one end of the heavy chain , rather than loss of light chains , is responsible for the effect of elastase on reassembly . Our reassembly buffers are essentially the same as those used by Keen et al . ( 1979 ) but these authors do not address the question Cell 758 a ori igin T 3 DO Ml MO b 645K ? \ , T C E . z 360K - 2 L m 7 : a E 180K - Figure 4 .

Let MO’ , DO’ , etc . indicate the total stain in the corresponding band , corrected to represent molar ratios of the various species . In model 1 , we assume that in a 8 . 6s clathrin trimer , each heavy chain has one closely associated light chain . If we further assume no correlation between heavy : light crosslinks . we calculate for a ratio a = Mi’ / ( MO’ + Ml’ ) that DO’ : Dl’ : D2’ : ( 1 - & : a ( 1 - n ) : 01 ~ . The predictions for observed values of a are labeled “model I . ” As an example of an alternative , we assume that in each trimer . one heavy chain systematically lacks a light chain . Calculated ratios for DO’ : Dl’ : D2’ are ( 3 - 4a + & / 3 : ( 4a - 2 & / 3 : aZ / 3 , and predictions for observed 01 are shown as “model 2 . ” The ratio of integrated peak densities , corrected by 0 . 83 for Ml and Dl and by 0 . 71 for D2 , are from Figure 3c and correspond to lanes 2 - 5 of Figure 3a . chain arms in limited association at the center , with a light chain positioned somewhere along each arm . The light chains are not required to maintain the threefold contacts , suggesting that they may be at some distance from the center . A light chain and heavy chain may have extensive interaction , since the efficiency of their crosslinking is greater than that between two arms . The molecular weight of solubilized clathrin determined by sedimentation equilibrium and by quantitative electron microscopy ( Ungewickell and Branton , 1981 ) agrees with the composition required by this model . Two classes of light chains have been shown to be present in a variety of different species and tissues ( Pearse , 1978 ) , although the precise sizes seem to vary . The general presence of such chains suggests a significant but presently unknown function , and the meaning of two classes is likewise obscure . The sus - ceptibility of light chains to proteolysis both in trimers’ and in cages suggests a readily accessible position . The crosslinking of elastase - treated trimers shows that proteolytic degradation leads to dissociation of light - chain fragments from the heavy chains . The elas - tase - treated trimers appear unable to reassemble cor - rectly into cages ; this observation may point to some function of light chains in assembly , although . their degradation in situ on the cages does not lead to disassembly . If we assume the heavy - chain mass to be distributed uniformly along its length , we calculate approximately six residues per angstrom . Since a single a - helix contains 0 . 67 residues per angstrom , the clathrin arms are unlikely to be simple fibrous structures such as a - helical coiled coils . We note the case of the T4 phage tail fiber , studied by Earnshaw et al . ( 19791 , which appears to be a rigid concatenation of tightly folded domains . Relation of Trimers to Cages Association of 8 . 6s clathrin under our conditions ap - pears always to lead to complete cages having a small variety of regular designs , based on polyhedra with hexagonal and pentagonal faces . This self - assembly implies similar contacts between the structure units . In all cages we have seen , three edges meet at a vertex . It is plausible to locate the center of a clathrin triskelion at each of these local threefold positions , with every arm spanning two edges . An important property of this distribution is that it allows conserva - tion of contacts between clathrin molecules in pen - tagonal as well as in hexagonal arrangement , with only small conformational changes to satisfy both cases ( Caspar and Klug , 1962 ) . Other modes of plac - ing clathrin in a cage ( such as , with triskelion centers at every second local threefold position ) require spe - cial reorganization to obtain pentagonal faces . We note that Crowther et al . ( 1976 ) estimated the molec - ular weight of a cage with 54 edges to be 22 x 106 . This corresponds to a lower limit of 400 , 000 daltons per edge or four half - arms per edge , consistent with the arrangement just described . Indeed , the edges of cages appear substantially thicker in negative stain than the arms of isolated molecules . The vertices of a cage are positions of curvature . We indeed have some evidence that isolated clathrin triskelions are not planar structures . Most micro - graphs show trimers with incomplete arms : a plausible interpretation is that the trimer arms are not coplanar and that the missing portion is protruding from the stain . A few favorable images of molecules embedded in clear stain gradients are consistent with this view ( Figure 4f ) . Experimental Procedures Preparation of Clathrin Clathrin was purified from gray matter of calf brains according to the procedure of Keen et al . ( 1976 ) with the following modifications . For each preparation , ten brains were taken within 1 hr of slaughter . During this period , the brains were either chilled or kept at 37”C , as suggested by Pearse ( 1980 ) . Unless otherwise stated , the rest of the purification was done at 4’C . The tissue was homogenized in a blender for 1 min at high speed with 2 vol of solution A [ O . i M NaMES ( pH 6 . 2 ) , 1 O - 3 M EGTA . 5 X 1 O - 4 M Mg & , 0 . 02 % NaN3 ] . Cell debris was separated by centrifugation in a JA - I 4 rotor ( Beckman ) for 30 min at 14 , 000 rpm , and a crude vesicle fraction was obtained from the supernatant by centrifugation in a type 35 rotor ( Beckman ) at 35 , 000 rpm for 60 min . The vesicle pellets were resuspended in solution A with the aid of a Dounce homogenizer , and 16 ml samples were applied to the tops of six discontinuous sucrose gradients ( 4 , Cdl 760 13 and 4 ml of solution A containing 5 , 10 and 40 % sucrose , respectively ) . These gradients were centrifuged in a SW 27 rotor ( Beckman ) at 20 , 000 rpm for 2 hr , and the 10 % sucrose fractions were pooled , diluted - with 3 vol of solution A , and centrifuged in a type 35 rotor at 35 , 000 rpm for 60 min . The pellets were resuspended in buffer A with the Dounce homogenizer , and 6 . 5 ml were applied to the tops of six discontinuous sucrose gradients ( 19 . 5 , 10 and 3 ml of solution A with 5 , 30 and 60 % sucrose , respectively ) and centrifuged in an SW 27 rotor at 20 , 000 rpm for 45 min . The 5 % fractions were pooled , diluted with 1 voi of buffer A , and centrifuged in a type 35 rotor at 35 , 000 rpm for 60 min . The pellets of purified coated vesicles were resuspended with a homogenizer in a final volume of 25 ml solution 6 [ 0 . 75 M Tris , 0 . 025 M NaMES ( pH 6 . 2 ) . 2 . 5 X 10m4 M EGTA , 1 . 2 x 1 Oe4 M MgCb , 0 . 02 % NaN & and clathrin and other proteins were allowed to solubilize for 30 min at room temperature . Membrane vesicles were then removed by centrifugation in a type 42 rotor ( Beckman ) at 42 , 000 rpm for 60 min ; the supernatant was brought up to a concentration of 30 % in ( NH & S04 , and after 30 min , a pellet was obtained by centrifugation in an SW 27 rotor for 10 min at 5000 rpm . This pellet was resuspended in solution B , the suspen - sion clarified by centrifugation at 42 , 000 rpm , and soluble proteins were concentrated wtih ( NH & SO4 as before . The pellet was resus - pended in about 5 ml of solution C [ 0 . 5 M Tris , 0 . 05 M NaMES ( pH 6 . 2 ) , 5 x 1 Oe4 M EGTA , 2 . 5 X 1 Oe4 M MgCI . , 0 . 02 % NaN & Clathrin was separated from other , smaller proteins by gel filtration on Biogel A - 5M ( Bio - Rad ) or Ultrogel AcA 22 ( LKB ) columns ( 2 . 5 x 75 cm or 2 . 5 x 86 cm respectively , equilibrated with solution C ) . A single peak emerged near the void volume ; pooled fractions corresponding to this peak yielded approximately 30 mg of protein ( Lowry . 1951 ) and constituted the purified clathrin sample . This solution had an OD2 & ODZeO ratio of 1 . 7 , E : % , ( 280 ) = 10 . 0 , and electron microscopy showed it to be free of membranous vesicles . Measurement of Sedimentation Velocity Sedimentation velocity was estimated by rate zonal centrifugation in 5 - 20 % linear sucrose gradients according to the procedure of Martin and Ames ( 1961 ) . Samples ( 50 - l 00 pl ) were loaded on top of preformed gradients and centrifuged in an SW 50 . 1 rotor ( Beckman ) at 48 , 000 rpm for 3 l / 2 hr at 18 - 20°C . The concentration profile was determined with a flow cell , monitoring Of & , , through the gradient by upward displacement with Fluorinert ( DuPont ) . Bovine liver cata - lase ( Sigma ) and bromelain - cleaved hemagglutinin from influenza virus ( gift from J . Skehel and D . C . Wiley ) were used as standards . Sodium Dodecylsulfate - Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis SDS - PAGE was performed in 15 % polyacrylamide slab minigels [ l : 37 . 5 ( w / w ) bisacrylamide : acrylamide ] containing 0 . 1 M Tris , 0 . 1 M Bicine ( pH 8 . 3 ) and 0 . 1 % SDS ( Earnshaw et al . , 1979 ) . Samples were mixed with 1 vol of sample buffer [ O . Ol M Tris , 0 . 01 M Bicine ( pH 8 . 3 ) , 30 % glycerol , 1 % SDS , 3 % @ mercaptoethanol ] , boiled for 1 min , run at 100 V for 15 min and stained with Coomassie Blue . Crosslinked products were analyzed on composite 1 % agarose - 3 . 5 % polyacrylamide slab gels [ l : I 2 ( w / w ) bisacrylamide : acrylamide ; gel 100 mm X 100 mm X 1 mm ] with Tris - Bicine buffer as above . When required , gels were scanned for optical density at 525 nm with a Helena Lab gel scanner . Crosslinking Crosslinking experiments were performed at room temperature with the bifunctional reagents dimethyl suberimidate ( DMS ) ( Davies and Stark , 1970 ) , dimethyl 3 - 3’ - dithio - bis - propionimidate ( DMTP ) , and dithio - bis - succinimidyl - propionate ( DTSP ) ( Lomant and Fairbanks , 1976 ) purchased from Pierce Chemical Co . The first two are rapidly hydrolysable imidoesters that crosslink primary amines with an opti - mum reactivity around pH 8 - 9 . The third acylates primary and set - > ondary amines , hydrolyses at a much slower rate and is reactive at pH 6 . 2 . Crosslinking experiments were performed in the following way : to provide adequate buffering capacity , 1 vol of 1 M triethanol - amine ( pH 8 . 5 ) was added to 4 vol protein at 0 . 6 mg / ml in 0 . 02 M imidazole or Na acetate ( pH 6 . 21 , 0 . 001 M EDTA ( or EGTA ) , 0 . 02 % NaN3 . The imidoesters were dissolved in 0 . 5 M triethanolamine ( pH 8 . 5 ) at 8 mg / ml , and an appropriate volume was added within 1 min to the protein sample . An equal amount of freshly prepared reagent was added after 30 min . The final concentration of the imidoesters was between 0 . 1 and 3 . 2 mg / ml . Dithio - bis - succinimidyl - propionate was first dissolved in acetone ( 28 mg / ml ) . diluted ten times with either 0 . 1 M triethanolamine ( pH 8 . 5 ) or 0 . 02 M Na acetate ( pH 6 . 2 ) and the turbidity was eliminated by heating at 37’C for 30 sec . The reagent was added to the protein sample to a final concentration between 0 . 025 and 0 . 8 mg / ml , and the crosslinking reaction was carried out for at least 30 min . The samples were then mixed with one volume of sample buffer without P - mercaptoethanol , incubated at 37°C for 30 - 45 min and subjected to electrophoresis . When dimethyl suberimidate was used as the crosslinking reagent , the sample buffer contained / 3 - mercaptoethanol , and the sample was boiled for 1 min prior to electrophoresis . Gels were run at 100 V for 2 l / 2 hrs . Electron Microscopy Clathrin was negatively stained using the flotation technique of Wrig - ley et al . ( 1977 ) . A carbon film , previously deposited onto freshly cleaved mica , was floated onto the surface of a solution of the sample to be examined . After 1 O - 30 set , the carbon film was withdrawn onto the same mica and floated onto a 2 % unbuffered uranyl acetate solution . After a few seconds , the carbon film was picked up from above with a 400 - mesh copper grid and dried by blotting with filter paper . Clathrin cages were used at a concentration of 0 . 6 - l . 3 mg / ml and solubilized trimers at 5 fig / ml , sometimes with added tomato bushy stunt virus at the same concentration . Samples were examined at 80 KV with a magnification of 45 , 000 in a Phillips EM - 301 micro - scope .
