Ayeswarya VIT UNIVERSITY Vellore - 632014 e - mail : anusudhak @ yahoo . co . in , sangeeth30 @ yahoo . co . in Abstract Digital watermarking has been proposed to increase the digital data security , confidentiality and integrity . Satellite image watermarking is a special category of image watermarking in the sense that the images have special requirements . Particulary , watermarked satellite images should not differ perceptually from the the original counterparts , because the purpose of taking the image must not be violated . This paper provides a third level DWT decomposition of the satellite image by choosing a region of interest and embedding the watermark in the same . The reason for choosing a region of interest is an area which contains important information and must be sent through media without any distortions and attacks . Image quality is checked out with a number of widely used metrics such as PSNR , Normalized correlation and JPEG compression . The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme , which fulfills the strict requirements concerning alterations of satellite images . Keywords : Digital watermarking , Region of Interest ( ROI ) , Discrete Wavelet Transform ( DWT ) , Peak Signal to Noise Ratio ( PSNR ) and Normalized Correlation ( NC ) . 1 . Introduction T he fast development of the Internet in the last decade has increased the opportunity for commercial presentation of their digital media products . Having the main interest in profit , the companies tend strongly to protect their ownership rights [ 1 ] . Digital Watermarking technology allows users to embed some data into digital contents such as still image , movie and audio data . In this paper , Wavelet transform is applied to both , the watermark and the ROI image before the process of embedding . Then , wavelet coefficients of the watermark are added to the most significant Coefficients of low and high frequency bands of the discrete wavelet transform of the ROI of the image . With the appropriate choice of the embedding formulas and scaling parameters in different frequency bands invisibility and robustness of the watermark are insured . The inverse transform is finally applied to obtain watermarked ROI . This watermarked region of interest is replaced in the original image to obtain the watermarked image . The intended receiver is provided with the key which contains the details of the pixel values of the ROI . Watermark detection is done by finding difference of the watermarked ROI and the ROI in wavelet domain . The paper depicts the technique of Discrete Wavelet Trans form in Section . 2 , Region of Interest in Section . 3 Algorithms for watermark insertion and extraction in Section 4 and 5 , and Experiments Results in Section 7 and conclusion in Section 8 .

Discrete Wavelet Transform A wavelet transform can be interpreted as decomposition into a set of frequency channels having the same bandwidth on a logarithmic scale [ 2 ] . Figure 2 shows the third level wavelet decomposition of the image shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 . Test Image Figure 2 . Third level wavelet decomposition 3 . Region of Interest A particular organization may specifically be interested in a particular region only . This region , termed as the Region of Interest ( RoI ) , is specific to the image user’s needs and Requirements [ 4 ] . It specifies the range of pixel values which are of interest to the user , as these pixel values should not be modified during embedding . Figure 3 . Original Image Figure 4 .

Watermark Insertion Algorithm : 1 ) Let G ( x , y ) represents the original image . 2 ) A particular ROI namely H ( x , y ) is chosen from G ( x , y ) . 3 ) Third level DWT decomposition is applied to H ( x , y ) and first level decomposition is applied to the watermark I ( x , y ) . 4 ) The coefficients of the watermarked ROI of the image are obtained by scaled addition W ( x , y ) = H ( x , y ) + α ( I ( x , y ) ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 1 ) α - salience , determines the strength of the watermark 5 ) Inverse of W ( x , y ) is obtained and the watermarked ROI is replaced in the original image . 5 . Watermark Extraction Algorithm : 1 . Intended receiver is provided with the details of ROI and the watermark . 2 . H ( x , y ) is cropped from the original image G ( x , y ) . 3 . W ( x , y ) and I ( x , y ) are DWT transformed in accordance with the embedding process . I’ ( x , y ) = [ W ( x , y ) - H ( x , y ) ] / α 4 . Inverse transform of I’ ( x , y ) is performed to construct back I ( x , y ) . 7979 Figure 5 . Watermark Embedding Figure 6 . Watermark Extraction 6 . Experimental Results The image shown in figure . 1 is taken as the original image in which the ROI is chosen depending upon the user specifications . A satellite image of size 600×363 in which a ROI of 100×100 was chosen and cropped to perform watermark embedding using wavelet transform . The wavelet used is Daubachies i . e’db1’ and α = . 15 provides better quality of the extracted watermark even after image manipulations . The watermark is shown in the figure 5 is of size 15×15 . The third level decomposition is performed on the original image and first level decomposition on the watermark . Matlab 7 . 0 is used for the simulation process . a ) Robustness to JPEG compression scheme ( α = . 15 ) Image compression can be considered as the most common signal processing operation performed on images . Resistance to this operation is the major factor which helps us to estimate the robustness of the watermark . Figure . 7 Watermark obtained after a compression 0f 50 % of its original size ( compression ratio = 4 . 93 ) . b ) Normalized correlation ( NC ) To verify the mark information , correlator is used as a watermark detector for recognizing the correlation signal between the watermarked image and the authorized mark . The sharp peaks in Figure 8 indicate the presence of the authorized watermark in the image 8080 Figure . 8 Detection of Authorized Watermark c ) Fidelity The basic property of watermarking is “Fidelity” which refers to the least distortion caused to the cover image by the embedding process , which is checked out by taking the difference between the original image and the watermarked image . Figure . 9 Difference between the Original image and the Watermarked Image ( α = . 15 ) 7 . Graphical Analysis To investigate the effect of the embedding process , the PSNR value is calculated for differing values of the normalized correlation . Table1 gives the PSNR value calculated for varying normalized correlation . From figure 10 , it is clear that the quality of the image is maintained for higher the NC . Table 2 gives the value of NC for varying compression ratio . From figure 11 , it is inferred that as the value of Compression ratio increases the Normalised correlation decreases . Table 1 .

The intended receiver is provided with the key which contains the details of the pixel values of the ROI . The experimental results have proven that the technique is efficient and resistible to image manipulations . As the level of decomposition increases higher is its resistibility to compression . PSNR values indicates that the visual quality of the image remains unaltered . The above process provides high security to the copyright information and prevents access from unauthorised users .
