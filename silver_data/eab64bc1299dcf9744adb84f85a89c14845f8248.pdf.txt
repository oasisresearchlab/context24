AmILCare ( Ambient Intelligence for Long - term diabetes Care ) is a project aimed at developing Information and Communication Technology solutions , based upon an AmI paradigm and co - designed with patients , to support healthy lifestyles in people with non insulin - treated Type 2 Diabetes T2D [ 4 ] . Based upon an integrated evaluation of the data collected by wearable sensors , smart objects will communicate to patients whether their daily activities have been more or less conducive to maintaining a satisfactory metabolic control and preventing complications . Feedbacks will take the form of emotional messages ( light , sound or cinematics effects , text / vocal messages ) from networked wearable devices or home appliances [ 5 ] . In the ﬁ rst phase of AmILCare , we aimed at probing the meaning that people with non - insulin - treated T2D attribute to technology for self - care and their willingness to partici - pate in co - designing AmI solutions . Research design and methods Thirty - four patients with non - insulin - treated T2D were recruited consecutively during their outpatient visits . Inclusion criteria were age < 80 , at least 1 - year previous attendance in our clinic and treatment by lifestyle alone or with non - insulin anti - hyperglycaemic agents . Recruitment began in September 2019 and forcibly stopped at the end of January 2020 , due to the COVID - 19 pandemic . The study was in accordance with the 2013 Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Institutional Ethics Com - mittees of Città della Salute e della Scienza di Torino and Ordine Mauriziano di Torino . All patients signed an informed consent to participate . Socio - demographic and clinical variables Socio - demographic and clinical variables obtained within the previous 12 months are listed in Table 1 . LDL Cho - lesterol and eGFR were calculated according to Friedewald et al . [ 6 ] and Cockroft and Gault formula [ 7 ] , respectively . Blood pressure was measured after 5 min lying using a mercury sphygmomanometer . Fundus examination was by digital retinal photography , graded according to Italian guidelines [ 8 , 9 ] . None of the patients suffered from clini - cally evident coronary , peripheral , or cerebral vascular disease . Interview protocol and psychometric evaluation The patients were administered a 50 min structured inter - view , adapted from a tool to analyze the usability of tech - nology by adults [ 10 ] . The dimensions explored and the questions are listed in Table 2 . Interviews were done by two * Marina Trento marina . trento @ unito . it 1 Laboratory of Clinical Pedagogy , Department of Medical Sciences , University of Turin , Turin , Italy 2 Diabetes Unit , Azienda Sanitaria Città di Torino , Turin , Italy 3 Links Foundation , Polytechnic University of Turin , Turin , Italy 4 Department of Public Health and Paediatric Sciences , University of Turin , Turin , Italy 1234567890 ( ) ; , : 1234567890 ( ) ; , : researchers and transcribed verbatim . Analysis of the interviews included objective and quantitative descriptions of the concepts expressed by the patients . Quality of Life was measured using a 39 - item DQoL / Mod version adapted for patients with T2D , translated , and revalidated into Italian [ 11 ] . The dimensions measured are : the 14 - item Satisfaction ( 14 items ) , impact of diabetes ( 20 items ) , and diabetes - related anxiety ( 5 items ) . Answers are along 5 - point Likert scales , from 1 ( very satis ﬁ ed ) to 5 ( very dissatis ﬁ ed ) . Scores range from 39 ( best quality of life ) to 195 ( worst quality ) . Self - esteem was measured by the Rosenberg Scale [ 12 ] , including ten items to be answered along 4 - point Likert scales . Scores ranges from 10 to 40 , higher values corre - sponding to better self - esteem .

Distribution of answers to the protocol interview were compared by gender by means of a chi - square test . Results Although we had planned to recruit 50 subjects , the COVID - 19 pandemic forced us to stop at 34 interviews . The patients had a median age of 72 years and 16 . 5 years disease duration ( Table 1 ) . DQoL Total ( M = 64 . 5 — IQ : 60 . 75 – 73 . 75 ) , and its dimensions Satisfaction ( M = 29 — IQ : 26 – 32 ) , impact ( M = 27 . 5 — IQ : 24 – 33 . 25 ) , and worry ( M = 8 — IQ : 6 – 10 . 25 ) suggested good quality of life , similarly to self - esteem scores ( M = 34 . 5 — IQ : 30 – 37 . 25 ) . Table 2 shows the distribution of answers to the inter - views . Nearly all persons showed interest in the AmI pro - ject , and technology had a positive connotation to them . Personal motivation to use technology included checking health , personal safety , or both . Except for three patients , most wished to share personal health information with their physician or family . There were no gender differences in the propensity to use technology for health control , personal motivation , whom to share health information with or support in disease care . Regarding the characteristics of technology aids , women favored small discreet objects , men valued non - intrusiveness ( p = 0 . 05 ) . Women were more inclined to draft an object for the AmILcare project ( p = 0 . 10 ) . Patients aiming to monitor their health and wishing to share information with family showed trends to better scores on the quality of life scale for complications ; lower HbA1c scores were recorded among those interested in the construction of new devices . Discussion Integrating technology into health care shifts account - ability from professionals to patients , rede ﬁ ning their role from passive recipients to active participants and requiring that they acquire speci ﬁ c competences [ 13 ] , a main pro - blem for non - technologically literate people . AmI aims at providing nonintrusive , intuitive solutions to make tech - nology easily available to people . A key point of AmIL - Care is the involvement of patients with diabetes in co - designing smart objects that will support them in their daily choices to maintain good control [ 14 ] . This study aimed at exploring how people with T2D perceive tech - nology , whether they use it in daily life , and their will - ingness to participate in developing solutions they might bene ﬁ t from . Since self - management involves daily choices made without the support of operators , people with T2D need support that is simple and easy to use . AmILCare aims at developing smart objects that will collect and process data about patients ’ behaviors and clinical variables and provide them with feedbacks to improve control . The interviews revealed the willingness of patients to participate in the project and some of their preferences . As shown in Table 2 , they wish to control blood pressure , presumably because they experience this noninvasive manouvre during medical examinations [ 15 ] , and prefer to discuss their health problems with their doctor , as in our clinic they spend more time talking with physicians than other professionals [ 16 ] . In terms of bene ﬁ ts expected of an AmI environment , women preferred to receive advice on nutrition but did not ask for speci ﬁ c information . As eating behaviors may change over time , choices need to be adapted accordingly [ 17 ] . The request for small , nonintrusive objects is in line with the AmI paradigm [ 18 ] , stating that technology should be supportive and respect expectations without becoming intrusive . Co - production of technology is a complex pro - cess , empowering and at the same time exploiting actors . It needs theoretical tools [ 18 , 19 ] as a user ’ s perception is affected by a continuum from expectations to experience with a given service [ 19 ] . Our interviews showed a pro - pensity by women to get involved in co - design , a useful aspect to nurture support in managing the disease [ 20 ] . Opportunities for training and involvement enable patients to personally acknowledge the challenges inherent in treating diabetes , a perspective that helps establish them as partners in decision - making [ 20 ] . This is , to our knowledge , the ﬁ rst study to inquire directly about the attitudes of people with non insulin - treated T2D towards health care technology , with a speci ﬁ c insight into AmI solutions . A limitation is the small number of patients . Unfortunately , the outbreak of the Covid - 19 pandemic made it unsafe to continue summoning patients for interviews in presence . However , the interviews helped reveal interests and expectations and gave indications about the characteristics that smart objects should have to make them acceptable and usable . This approach could be extended to other inter - ventions aimed at promoting patient participation and wish to collaborate in decision - making and disease self - management .
