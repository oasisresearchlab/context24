Abstract Background : Previous research has shown that articles may be cited more frequently on the basis of title or abstract positivity . Whether a similar selective sharing practice exists on Twitter is not well understood . The objective of this study was to assess if COVID - 19 articles with positive titles or abstracts were tweeted more frequently than those with non - positive titles or abstracts . Methods : COVID - 19 related articles published between January 1 st and April 14 th , 2020 were extracted from the LitCovid database and all articles were screened for eligibility . Titles and abstracts were classified using a list of positive and negative words from a previous study . A negative binomial regression analysis controlling for confounding variables ( 2018 impact factor , open access status , continent of the corresponding author , and topic ) was performed to obtain regression coefficients , with the p values obtained by likelihood ratio testing . Results : A total of 3752 COVID - 19 articles were included . Of the included studies , 44 titles and 112 abstracts were positive ; 1 title and 7 abstracts were negative ; and 3707 titles and 627 abstracts were neutral . Articles with positive titles had a lower tweet rate relative to articles with non - positive titles , with a regression coefficient of - 1 . 10 ( P < . 001 ) , while the positivity of the abstract did not impact tweet rate ( P = . 2218 ) . Conclusion : COVID - 19 articles with non - positive titles are preferentially tweeted , while abstract positivity does not influence tweet rate .

The global impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic has elicited a response from scientists and researchers worldwide with over 5000 COVID - 19 related articles listed on PubMed as of April 18 th , 2020 ( 3 , 4 ) . This expanding volume of research has necessitated streamlined methods to disseminate information to frontline clinicians in a timely manner . As a result , scientists and clinicians have increasingly turned to social media platforms such as Twitter to share , discuss , and respond to peer reviewed studies , in some cases prior to the peer review process ( 5 ) . Social media has become integrated within the research workflow with applications throughout the continuum of research reporting , from the identification of opportunities to dissemination of findings ( 6 , 7 ) . Traditionally , citation - based metrics have been employed in order to quantify and track the dissemination of research findings ; however , these metrics neglect the dissemination of a study online through social media . Altmetric is an online tool which tracks social media sharing of articles from a variety of sources such as Twitter , Facebook , and Reddit ( 8 , 9 ) . Altmetric has previously been used to explore how variables such as study discipline , number of authors , and country of origin are associated with an article ' s dissemination online ( 10 , 11 ) . Studies have shown a lack of correlation between Twitter - based altmetrics and citation - based metrics , suggesting that altmetrics reflect a distinct yet complementary source of information to traditional citation - based metrics ( 12 , 13 ) . Thus , the dissemination of a particular study can be more holistically assessed through the incorporation of altmetrics ( 14 , 15 ) . Particularly , citation - based metrics are subject to a time - lag during times of rapid research output , such as the COVID - 19 pandemic , due to the publication process . .

Understanding the determinants of research dissemination is essential , as various study characteristics may lead to the preferential sharing of certain findings . For example , a particular study may be cited or shared online more frequently on the basis of positive findings . These selective citation practices are well documented in medical literature and are particularly problematic since studies with positive results may be overrepresented , potentially influencing the perceived effectiveness of a particular intervention and leading to a systematic deviation from the truth ; known as citation bias ( 16 – 18 ) . Particularly , it has been found that studies with positive titles or conclusions , or higher accuracy estimates are cited more frequently in imaging diagnostic accuracy literature ( 19 , 20 ) . It is not well understood whether an analogous form of selective tweeting exists in COVID - 19 literature . The objective of this study is to assess for the presence of selective tweeting in COVID - 19 literature by evaluating whether articles with positive titles or abstracts are tweeted more frequently than those with negative or neutral titles or abstracts .

Articles were excluded if they were not on the topic of COVID - 19 , the title was not in English , or if they were retracted . Data collection Four investigators ( ZH , SW [ second year medical student ] , SK [ second year medical student ] and LT [ third year medical student ] ) extracted the article title , abstract , authorship , publication date , continent of corresponding author ( Asia , Africa , North America , South America , or Australia ) , and topic ( General Info , Mechanism , Diagnosis , Transmission , Treatment , Prevention , Epidemic Forecasting , and Case Report ) from LitCovid . Two investigators ( NF and SW ) extracted the 2018 journal impact factor and open access status ( open access or subscription - based ) from Clarivate Analytics Journal Citation Reports . One investigator ( ZH ) used Altmetric to derive the number of tweets made about an article ( on April 18 th , 2020 ) . Article DOIs were used to query the Altmetric Details Page API , version v1 . If DOIs were not available , the article title was used to search Altmetric Explorer . All extractions were done independently , in single . Missing information was recorded as “not reported” . Default values were assigned in cases where the complete publication date was not available : in cases where the day of publication was unavailable , the first of the month was assigned as default , and in cases where only the year of publication was available , March 1 st was assigned as default . For journals not listed on Clarivate Analytics Journal Citation Reports an impact factor of 0 was assigned . For studies with multiple topics or continents listed , the first listed was extracted . Five investigators analyzed the full text of the articles independently and in duplicate ( NF [ 50 % ] , ZH [ 50 % ] ; SW [ 70 % ] , SK [ 15 % ] , and LT [ 15 % ] ) to determine type of article ( original .

Articles whose full text was not available through institutional subscription or whose abstract was not in English were classified as “unspecified” . Assessment of title and abstract positivity Sentiment criteria was derived and modified from a previous study ( 21 ) . Positive , and negative categories contained 25 words each and all other words were deemed to be neutral , as shown in Figure 1 . Python v3 . 7 . 4 was used to search included article titles or abstracts for words in sentiment criteria . All words were assigned as + 1 ( positive ) , - 1 ( negative ) , or 0 ( neutral ) based on the previously described categories . The positive word ‘novel’ was deemed neutral in all cases referring directly to the name of the virus itself . If the sum was greater than 0 , less than 0 , or equal to 0 , the abstract or title was deemed to be positive , negative , or neutral , respectively . If no abstract was present , a default value of 0 ( neutral ) was assigned . Positive words Amazing , assuring , astonishing , bright , creative , encouraging , enormous , excellent , favourable , groundbreaking , hopeful , innovative , inspiring , inventive , novel , phenomenal , prominent , promising , reassuring , remarkable , robust , spectacular , supportive , unique , unprecedented Negative words Detrimental , disappointing , disconcerting , discouraging , disheartening , disturbing , frustrating , futile , hopeless , impossible , inadequate , ineffective , insignificant , insufficient , irrelevant , mediocre , pessimistic , substandard , unacceptable , unpromising , unsatisfactory , unsatisfying , useless , weak , worrisome Figure 1 .

Inclusion of variables into the final model was performed using stepwise selection based on the Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) in R ( MASS package ) ( 22 – 24 ) . A subgroup analysis was then conducted for original and non - original research articles . For the original research articles , another negative binomial regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between abstract positivity and tweet rate , controlling for the same variables as defined previously . For the non - original articles , a negative binomial regression analysis was conducted looking at tweet rate and controlling for the same confounding variables . Articles classified as “unspecified” were excluded from the subgroup analysis Regression coefficients were calculated for each outcome variable to evaluate the association between a specific variable and tweet rate . Positive and negative regression coefficients represented positive and negative associations between a given variable and tweet rate , where the magnitude of the regression coefficient represented the strength of association . Predictive Mean Matching imputation was performed for variables with more than 10 % missingness proportion . The imputation was performed with the MICE package in R ( version 3 . 6 . 3 , R Foundation for Statistical Computing ) ( 25 – 28 ) . The p - values for the association of the variables of interest with tweet rate were obtained using R software by means of likelihood ratio testing with a chi - squared mode , where a value of 0 . 05 was used as the threshold for significance .

A negative association was found between tweet rate and positive titles meaning that studies with positive titles were tweeted less frequently than those with non - positive ones . This association persisted in the sub analyses for original and non - original research articles . For the original research articles , no association was found between abstract positivity and tweet rate . Further , there were substantially fewer negative titles ( n = 1 ) and abstracts ( n = 7 ) than positive titles ( n = 44 ) and abstracts ( n = 112 ) . These findings are consistent with the current state of several scientific disciplines which have a low prevalence of negative studies and a high prevalence of positive studies ( 29 , 30 ) . Surprisingly , our findings suggest that COVID - 19 articles with positive titles are tweeted to a lesser extent than those with non - positive titles . Previous research has shown that positive titles and abstracts are known drivers of citations , and since tweets and citations are weakly associated , one may infer that positive titles and abstracts would also serve as drivers for tweets ( 13 , 19 ) . Despite this , the opposite was observed which may indicate that there are other drivers of tweet rate which dominate such as the 2018 impact factor , open access status , continent of the corresponding author , or topic . Particularly , higher impact factor , articles in subscription based journals , and several topics ( General Info , Prevention , Transmission , and Treatment ) were found to be positively associated with tweet rate . Further , articles with overly positive titles may be perceived as a form of ‘academic clickbait’ , and previous research has found that these strategies negatively influence their perceived quality , causing readers to avoid them ( 31 – 33 ) . .

Interestingly , although a significant association was present between title positivity and tweet rate , there was a lack of significant association between abstract positivity and tweet rate . This finding could indicate that a large sum of readers share articles on the basis of the title without taking the time to read the contents of the article itself , let alone the abstract . This theory is supported by a study which found that 59 % of articles shared on Twitter are shared without ever being read . ( 34 ) . The sharing of articles on Twitter on the basis of title , without reading the contents of the article itself , may allow for the dissemination of poor quality research . Limitations This study is subject to limitations . Firstly , the list of positive and negative words is finite , and thus may not have quantified all sentiment present in the titles and abstracts . A prespecified list of words was employed in order to exclude the subjective bias in classifying the sentiment of words as positive , negative , or neutral . Further , the location or context of the word in the title or abstract was not studied , which could hold significant value . Moreover , self - promotion ( e . g . authors tweeting their own article ) could influence the number of tweets an article receives , however , the extent of this is difficult to quantify . Also , this study did not determine the sentiment of the tweets , which could provide insightful information . Despite this , it has been demonstrated that 94 . 8 % of tweets linking to scientific papers were neutral in sentiment ( 35 ) , suggesting that a similar trend was present in this cohort . There was also a loss of precision due to the use of the categorical variable continent instead of the country of the corresponding author’s institution , which was necessary in order to get an appropriate fit of the model .

Conclusion As Twitter becomes increasingly integrated within the research workflow , the selective tweeting of articles with positive titles or abstracts can mislead researchers and clinicians as they seek evidence for the management of COVID - 19 . This study demonstrated that positive titles are associated with lower tweet rates than non - positive titles , and that abstract positivity does not impact tweet rate . Further research should aim to assess for the presence of selective citation practices in COVID - 19 literature . Data - Sharing Statement : All articles were extracted from the LitCovid database .
