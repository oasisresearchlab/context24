Dysfunction of this process can lead to the disruption of signaling cascades or cilium 13 assembly , resulting in developmental disorders and cancer . Previous studies on the protein 14 delivery to the cilium were mostly focused on the membrane - embedded receptors . In 15 contrast , how soluble proteins are delivered into the cilium is poorly understood . In our work , 16 we identify the exocyst complex as a key player in the ciliary trafficking of soluble Gli 17 transcription factors . In line with the known function of the exocyst in intracellular vesicle 18 transport , we demonstrate that soluble proteins , including Gli2 / 3 and Lkb1 , can use the 19 endosome recycling machinery for their delivery to the primary cilium . Finally , we identify 20 GTPases : Rab14 , Rab18 , Rab23 , and Arf4 that are involved in vesicle - mediated Gli protein 21 ciliary trafficking . Our data pave the way for a better understanding of ciliary transport and 22 uncover novel transport mechanisms inside the cell . 23 Introduction 24 Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling is essential for embryonic patterning and organ morphogenesis 1 . 25 Malfunctions of this pathway can lead to developmental disorders and cancer . The expression 26 of Hh target genes is controlled by Gli transcription factors : Gli1 which acts as an activator , 27 and Gli2 / Gli3 , which display both activator and repressor functions 2 . 28 Processing of Gli transcription factors to activator and repressor forms requires their efficient 29 transport to the primary cilium , which integrates proteins necessary to a variety of Gli 30 modifications 3 – 8 . Cilia are indispensable for the transduction of the Hh signal and the 31 translocation of Gli activators into the nucleus 9 . In humans , defects in the ciliary function and 32 the trafficking of ciliary proteins often result in developmental defects associated with the 33 dysfunction of the Hh / Gli cascade . 34 Gli proteins are large and slowly diffusing proteins , so it is puzzling how they accumulate at 35 the cilium within a mere few minutes upon signal reception 10 . This accumulation is a result of 36 a three - step process : ( 1 ) targeted transport to the cilium base , ( 2 ) gated entry through a 37 diffusion barrier , and ( 3 ) active trafficking along the cilium . The mechanisms of Gli transition 38 across the diffusion barrier and the model of transport from the base to the tip are relatively 39 well - described 11 – 13 . Specifically , inside the cilium the Gli proteins appear to utilize the 40 conserved intraflagellar transport ( IFT ) system for the delivery from the base of the cilium to 41 the tip and back to the base 10 , 14 – 18 . At the base of the cilium , Gli proteins must pass the 42 diffusion barrier reminiscent of the nuclear pore with the help of some of the same molecular 43 players as those involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling : Ran , importins , and exportins 12 , 19 , 20 . 44 However , it is still unclear how Gli proteins are delivered from the cytoplasm to the cilium 45 base in the first place . 46 Most previous studies on protein delivery to the ciliary base were focused on membrane 47 proteins . Three different transport routes have been described for their delivery from the 48 Golgi complex to the primary cilium 21 . Some ciliary proteins first reach the plasma membrane 49 and then move to the ciliary membrane by lateral transport 22 . Others reach the base of the 50 cilium using regulated vesicular transport , either directly or through the recycling trafficking 51 pathway 23 . 52 The process of protein trafficking to the primary cilium is supported by many players involved 53 in endocytosis and the vesicle transport machinery 24 – 26 . Prominent among them are small 54 GTPases , which act as molecular switches that allow for the guidance of their associated 55 vesicles 27 – 29 . In addition to GTPases , the protein ciliary trafficking depends on several 56 multiprotein complexes , such as the BBsome 30 , 31 and the exocyst 32 , 33 . The exocyst , in 57 particular , is a conserved protein complex that mediates the tethering of secretory vesicles to 58 the plasma membrane 34 . Many protein trafficking routes depend on the exocyst , including 59 those for protein delivery to the cell junctions and protein endocytosis and recycling 35 , 36 . The 60 transport function of the exocyst relies on its interaction with membrane phospholipids 37 , 38 , 61 polarity proteins 39 , 40 and small GTPases 40 – 43 . Importantly , the exocyst interacts with the ciliary 62 transport machinery , and has been implicated in the transport of transmembrane proteins 63 necessary for ciliogenesis and signaling 23 , 42 , 44 – 47 , but its role in the trafficking of soluble ciliary 64 proteins has not been demonstrated . 65 In our quest to identify the molecular machinery that delivers Gli proteins to the cilium base , 66 we performed a proteomic analysis of Gli3 interactors . Interestingly , among Gli3 - binding 67 proteins , we detected several exocyst subunits 34 . Loss - of - function assays show the 68 dependence of Gli2 and Gli3 ciliary localization on the exocyst . Consistent with the role of this 69 complex in vesicle trafficking , we show that Gli2 uses intracellular vesicles as trafficking 70 vehicles . In addition , several small GTPases , including Rab14 , Rab18 , Rab23 , and Arf4 , regulate 71 the ciliary transport of Gli2 . Finally , we show that this vesicle - based transport machinery is 72 used for the ciliary delivery of Lkb1 , another soluble protein that concentrates at cilia . Our 73 study uncovers a novel vesicle - dependent transport pathway for soluble ciliary proteins and 74 sheds new light on the mechanisms of protein delivery to the cilium base . 75 Results 76 The exocyst complex interacts with Gli3 77 To identify proteins that help guide Gli proteins to the primary cilium , we immunoprecipitated 78 proteins that interact with Gli3 in cells treated with the Smoothened ( Smo ) agonist SAG 48 . 79 Cells were separated into “nuclear” and “cytoplasmic” fractions using hypotonic lysis and low - 80 speed centrifugation , and each fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti - Gli3 antibodies . 81 The eluates were separated using SDS - PAGE , and prominent bands were submitted for MS - 82 based protein identification ( Fig . 1A ) . 83 Mascot ' s search of the MS spectra yielded a total of 898 unique proteins . From this dataset , 84 we selected 473 high confidence Gli3 interactors by rejecting proteins that are frequently 85 found as IP / MS contaminants based on the CRAPome database 49 . In this dataset , we found 86 well - known Gli interaction partners , such as SuFu , Kif7 , and Xpo7 50 – 53 . The dataset was 87 enriched for proteins involved in intraciliary and vesicle transport , chromatin remodeling , and 88 DNA repair ( Fig . 1B ) and contained components of multi - subunit ciliary transport complexes , 89 including the BBSome and the exocyst ( Fig . 1C , Supplementary Table S1 ) . 90 Because exocyst , a multi - subunit protein complex involved in vesicle transport and docking 54 , 91 had previously been implicated in the trafficking of proteins to primary cilia , we decided to 92 focus on its components as potential mediators of the Gli proteins delivery to the cilium base . 93 The exocyst has mostly been studied in the context of its binding to intracellular vesicles and 94 the plasma membrane , but the subunits that were specifically enriched in the Gli3 95 interactome are positioned away from the putative lipid - binding surface of the complex , 96 consistent with Gli3 being a soluble , rather than a lipid - embedded protein ( Fig . 1D ) . 97 In agreement with the proteomic data , Gli3 , as well as Gli2 , co - immunoprecipitate with Sec5 98 ( Fig . 2A ) . Moreover , Sec5 and Gli2 tightly colocalize in cells , as shown using the proximity 99 ligation assay ( Fig . 2B , Fig . S1 ) . Similarly , overexpressed Sec3 , Sec5 , and Sec8 interact with the 100 constitutively active Gli2 mutants Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ( Fig . 2C , D ) 55 . We decided to use Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) in 101 most experiments because it localizes to cilia in the absence of upstream activation , allowing 102 us to study its trafficking independently of the transport of membrane proteins regulating 103 endogenous Gli proteins , such as Smo and Ptch 56 , 57 . 104 To identify the Gli2 domain responsible for interaction with the exocyst , we performed co - 105 immunoprecipitation of Sec3 / 5 / 8 with the N - terminal domain of Gli2 and a construct lacking 106 the N - terminus . The exocyst subunits interact with the N - terminus of Gli2 ( HA - Gli2 - N ) but 107 interact only weakly with Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) - Δ N ( Fig . 2E , F ) . 108 Trafficking of Gli2 to cilia depends on the exocyst 109 Because the exocyst is required for the trafficking of some ciliary proteins , we hypothesized 110 that the loss - of - function of the exocyst could impair Gli ciliary localization . To test this 111 assertion , we knocked down individual exocyst subunits in cells expressing Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) . Both 112 shRNA - ( Fig . 3A ) and siRNA - mediated knockdown ( Fig . 3B ) of exocyst subunits resulted in a 113 significant reduction of Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ciliary localization in NIH / 3T3 ( Fig . 3C and D ) and mIMCD3 114 cells ( Fig . S2A ) . Similarly , the SAG - induced ciliary accumulation of endogenous Gli2 is reduced 115 in NIH / 3T3 cells with Sec3 / 5 / 8 knockdown ( Fig . S2B ) 116 Similarly , mislocalization of Sec5 using the mitochondrial trap 58 impairs the ciliary trafficking 117 of Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) . We fused Sec5 with the mitochondrial protein Tom20 and mScarlet and co - 118 expressed the resulting Tom20 - mScarlet - Sec5 construct with Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ( Fig . 4A ) . We 119 observed a reduced Gli2 ciliary level in cells overexpressing the Tom20 - mScarlet - Sec5 120 mitochondrial trap , compared to those overexpressing two negative control constructs – 121 Tom20 - mScarlet and mScarlet - Sec5 ( Fig . 4B ) . 122 Finally , the exocyst inhibitor endosidin2 59 reduces Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ciliary localization in the stable 123 cell line after just two hours of treatment ( Fig . 4C ) . 124 Because the exocyst binds to Gli2 mostly via its N - terminal domain ( Fig 2E , F ) , we suspected 125 that removing the N - terminus would impair Gli2 ciliary accumulation . Accordingly , we 126 observed a strong reduction of the Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) - Δ N mutant localization in the primary cilium 127 compared to the full - length protein ( Fig . 4D ) . 128 Having demonstrated that the exocyst is required for the trafficking of Gli to cilia , we 129 wondered if the localization of the exocyst is affected by Hh pathway activation . Indeed , the 130 treatment with SAG increases the amount of Sec3 and Sec5 at the ciliary base ( Fig . 4E ) . 131 Gli2 associates with intracellular vesicles 132 While the best - known role of the exocyst complex is the transport of vesicle - embedded 133 membrane proteins , our results suggest that soluble cytoplasmic Gli proteins may also use the 134 exocyst as a vehicle for intracellular trafficking . We , therefore , wondered if Gli proteins , like 135 membrane receptors , use vesicles for their transport into the cilium . To verify this hypothesis , 136 we used super - resolution AiryScan microscopy to image cells co - expressing HA - Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) 137 and EGFP - Sec5 , and surprisingly , we observed Gli2 around Sec5 - positive vesicle - like 138 structures . It suggests that Gli2 could accumulate on the surface of vesicles , where it could 139 interact directly with the exocyst ( Fig . 5A ) . 140 141 We also looked at Gli2 localization by immunogold electron microscopy . In HEK293T cells 142 overexpressing EGFP - Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) , we observed EGFP - positive clusters adjacent to membrane 143 vesicle - like structures ( Fig . 5B ) . 144 To check if Gli - positive structures represent intracellular vesicles , we isolated vesicles using 145 cell fractionation . HA - Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) , endogenous Gli3 , and Sec5 co - fractionated with the 146 endosome marker EEA1 in the endosomal fraction . ERK was used as the cytoplasmic control 147 marker . The total abundance of proteins in fractions we showed by silver staining ( Fig . 5C ) . 148 The most likely explanation for our results is that Gli proteins are transported on the surface 149 of vesicles towards the ciliary base . We reasoned that the vesicles likely fuse at the base of 150 the primary cilium 60 releasing Gli proteins . Therefore , for continuous trafficking , new vesicles 151 that would carry Gli proteins would need to form . The two potential sources of these vesicles 152 are the Golgi apparatus via the exocytic pathway 61 , 62 and the plasma membrane by 153 endocytosis 63 – 65 . Firstly , we inhibited endocytosis using two inhibitors : dynasore 66 and 154 pitstop2 67 in cells expressing constitutively active Gli2 . Surprisingly , after 2h of dynasore 155 treatment , we observed an almost complete inhibition of Gli2 ciliary accumulation . This effect 156 was independent of Smo because treatment with two Smo inhibitors cyclopamine and 157 vismodegib did not affect the Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ciliary level ( Fig . 5E and Fig . S3A ) . 158 If the dynasore effects are a consequence of the reduced rate of new vesicle formation , we 159 would expect these effects to be fully reversible once the proper formation of vesicles is 160 restored . We used a pulse - chase assay with 2h vismodegib + dynasore treatment , and then 161 we washed out dynasore from the media and collected cells at several time points . We 162 observed a clear recovery of Gli2 ciliary transport within 1h from the dynasore washout ( Fig . 163 5D ) . This effect was present in both NIH / 3T3 cells ( Fig . 5D ) and in IMCD3 cells ( Fig . S3 ? ? ? ) , 164 suggesting that cells utilizing both the intracellular and extracellular ciliogenesis pathways 165 ( NIH / 3T3 and IMCD3 , respectively 68 ) use endocytic vesicles to deliver Gli proteins to cilia . 166 As an alternative to dynasore , we also used another commercial clathrin - dependent 167 endocytosis inhibitor pitstop2 . Because of its lethal effect on NIH / 3T3 fibroblasts in less than 168 30min , we treated cells with pitstop2 for 15 min , followed by a 30min incubation without the 169 drug . Similar to the dynasore effects , we observed a decrease of Gli2 ciliary level in pitstop2 - 170 treated cells ( Fig . 5F ) . Importantly , neither dynasore , nor pitstop2 induced gross 171 morphological changes indicative of toxicity under the conditions used to block endocytosis 172 ( Fig . S3B ) . 173 To determine if the vesicle transport from the cis - Golgi was also important for Gli2 ciliary 174 trafficking , we treated stable HA - Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) cells with brefeldin A , a Golgi - disrupting drug 69 . 175 We did not observe changes in Gli2 ciliary localization after 2h treatment ( Fig . 5G ) . 176 The stimulation of target gene transcription by Gli2 is enhanced by its localization at the 177 cilium 9 , 70 . We expected that dynasore would inhibit Hh target gene transcription in cells stably 178 expressing the Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) . Indeed , the expression of the Hh target gene Gli1 was decreased 179 after dynasore treatment , although the expression of HA - Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) was unchanged ( Fig . 5H ) . 180 Rab and Arf proteins mediate Gli2 transport 181 The trafficking of vesicles in cells is guided by the reversible association of small GTPases , 182 especially from the Rab and Arf families 25 , 71 . Because their association with vesicles and 183 associated proteins is transient , we hypothesized that under the stringent conditions of our 184 initial co - IP / MS , the Gli - associating GTPases may have been washed away from the bait 185 protein . Thus , we performed another co - IP / MS , with less stringent detergents , using HA - 186 Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) as bait in cells that either had normal cilia or were devoid of cilia by means of 187 overexpression of a dominant - negative mutant Kif3a motor 72 . We expected the GTPases 188 promoting Gli ciliary trafficking to be associated with Gli2 in ciliated , but not in unciliated cells 189 ( Fig . 6A ) . 190 We identified 200 high - confidence interactors ( < 10 % FDR in the CRAPome database ) including 191 the same well - known regulators of Gli , such as SuFu , Kif7 , Xpo7 , and Spop 53 , 51 , 73 , 74 , as well as 192 component proteins of the cilium and basal body ( Fig . 6B , Supplementary Table S2 ) . Among 193 proteins associated with Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) in ciliated cells were Rab14 , Rab5c , Rab11b , Rab18 , and 194 Arf4 ( Fig . 6C ) . In addition , we tested two other Rab - family GTPases : the well - known Hh 195 regulator Rab23 75 – 77 and Rab8 , which cooperates with the exocyst in the trafficking of 196 membrane receptors to primary cilium 43 , 78 . 197 Initially , we established by co - IP that Rab14 , Rab18 , Rab23 , and Arf4 proteins interact with 198 Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ( Fig . 7A ) . In contrast , two Rab GTPases that had been implicated in ciliary 199 trafficking of membrane proteins : Rab8 and Rab11a , do not strongly bind to Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ( Fig . 200 S4A ) . 201 Subsequently , we performed loss - of - function experiments using shRNA and CRISPR / Cas9 202 mutagenesis . The knockdown of Rab14 , Rab18 , and Arf4 caused the reduction of the Gli2 ( P1 - 203 6A ) ciliary level ( Fig . 7B - D ) . Likewise , the CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated Rab14 , Rab18 , and Rab23 204 knockout also significantly decreased the Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ciliary accumulation ( Fig . 7E ) . Moreover , 205 we engineered cell lines expressing dominant - negative Rab23S51N and Arf4T31N mutants 206 from doxycycline - inducible promoters . Consistent with shRNA - and CRISPR / Cas9 - based 207 experiments , we observed a significant decrease of Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ciliary accumulation in cells 208 expressing Arf4 and Rab23 mutants ( Fig . 7F ) . 209 The trafficking of Lkb1 , but not Ubxn10 , depends on endocytosis and the exocyst 210 We wanted to know if the mechanism of transport to cilia with the use of endocytic vesicles 211 was unique to Gli proteins or more common among other soluble ciliary proteins . For this 212 purpose , we imaged several HA or GFP tagged soluble ciliary candidate proteins : HA - Dvl2 79 , 213 Kap3a - EGFP 80 , HA - Lkb1 81 , HA - Mek1 82 , HA - Nbr1 83 , HA - Raptor 84 , Tbx3 - GFP 85 , and Ubxn10 - 214 GFP 86 . Only two proteins clearly localized at cilia in NIH / 3T3 : Ubxn10 - GFP , and HA - Lkb1 ( Fig . 215 8A and Fig . S5 ) . 216 To examine if the ciliary serine - threonine kinase Lkb1 uses an analogous transport mechanism , 217 we treated stable expressing HA - Lkb1 cells with dynasore and observed decreased Lkb1 ciliary 218 level ( Fig . 8D ) . Similar to Gli2 , ciliary accumulation of HA - Lkb1 also dropped after the shRNA 219 knockdown of Sec3 / 5 / 8 ( Fig . 8B ) . Accordingly , we detected HA - Lkb1 in the endosomal fraction 220 ( Fig . 7G ) . Finally , we observed using co - IP that Lkb1 binds to the exocyst subunits ( Fig . 8F ) . 221 Another soluble ciliary protein that we studied was Ubxn10 . Dynasore treatment did not 222 negatively affect the ciliary trafficking of Ubxn10 - GFP ( Fig . 8E ) . Unlike for Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) , we 223 observed no effect of Sec5 knockdown on Ubxn10 ciliary localization ( Fig . 8C ) . Consistent with 224 these results , we detected Ubxn10 predominantly in the cytosolic cell fraction ( Fig . 8H ) . 225 226 Discussion 227 The cilium is an essential organelle that relays environmental signals to the nucleus . 228 Nevertheless , the mechanism of the signaling protein delivery to cilia is still poorly 229 understood , especially for soluble proteins . To gain a better understanding of cytoplasmic 230 proteins ' transport to cilia we studied Gli transcription factors , large soluble proteins that 231 accumulate at the tip of the cilium before their conversion into transcriptional activators 5 , 9 , 11 . 232 Using proteomic screening , we found that Gli proteins interact with the exocyst , a complex 233 implicated in ciliary delivery of membrane receptors 23 , 54 . We found that loss - of - function of 234 the exocyst by RNAi , mitochondrial trap , or drug treatment decreases ciliary localization of 235 the constitutively active mutant Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) independently of their effect on transmembrane 236 Hh signaling proteins Ptch and Smo . 237 On a molecular level , we show that the N - terminal region of Gli proteins binds to the 238 subcomplex I of the exocyst , which includes the Sec3 / 5 / 6 / 8 subunits 34 , 87 . This agrees with our 239 data and published reports suggesting that the N - terminal domain is necessary for the Gli 240 proteins ciliary accumulation 5 , 9 , 11 . The N - terminus is , however , not sufficient for Gli ciliary 241 transport , with other domains , particularly the central domain of Gli2 / 3 5 , 9 likely participating 242 in other stages of ciliary translocation , such as the passage through the diffusion barrier and 243 the transport to the cilium tip . 244 Our results suggest that soluble cytoplasmic proteins , like Gli2 / 3 , can use the exocyst as a 245 vehicle for intracellular trafficking . The exocyst was shown to collaborate with the BLOC - 1 246 complex and IFT20 in the transport of membrane proteins polycystin - 2 and fibrocystin to 247 cilia 23 . However , IFT20 does not interact with HA - Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) ( Fig . S4A ) . This suggests that the 248 exocyst may mediate Gli protein ciliary trafficking independently of IFT20 , which implies that 249 the pathways directing membrane and soluble cilium components are somewhat divergent . 250 Importantly , the exocyst can be transported to the cilium despite IFT20 loss - of - function 23 . 251 Interestingly , we found that the exocyst subunits accumulate at the cilium base upon 252 stimulation of the canonical Hh signaling . The most parsimonious explanation of this result is 253 that the exocyst is co - transported with Gli proteins upon pathway activation . Alternatively , 254 the exocyst might be delivered to the cilium base independently of Gli proteins , and then 255 either trap these proteins at the base prior to their translocation to the cilium or promote 256 their accumulation at the cilium indirectly . However , the fact that we see foci of interaction 257 between Gli2 and the exocyst in areas distal to the cilium ( Fig . 2B ) suggests that the co - 258 transport hypothesis is most likely . 259 Consistent with the requirement of the exocyst in the transport of Gli2 to cilia , it appears that 260 Gli2 is associated , at least transiently , with intracellular vesicles . Interestingly , the subunits of 261 the exocyst that most strongly interact with Gli2 are positioned away from the putative lipid - 262 facing surface of the complex 34 , 87 , indicating that the exocyst may form a tether between 263 vesicle lipids and soluble proteins . Structural ciliary proteins had been previously found to be 264 attached to the outer surfaces of intracellular vesicles carrying ciliary membrane proteins in 265 Chlamydomonas 88 . We now provide functional data that corroborate and extend these 266 findings . Protein delivery by vesicles to the cilium is persistent and essential for maintaining 267 proper cilium function and structure 89 , 90 . Thus , the strategy of using vesicles as universal 268 carriers of proteins , both soluble and membrane - embedded , to cilia , solves the logistical 269 problem of homing many protein classes onto the tiny cilium base . 270 The trafficking of vesicles in cells is coordinated by the small GTPases from the Rab and Arf 271 families . Intriguingly , we found that Rab14 , Rab18 , Rab23 , and Arf4 , interact with Gli2 and are 272 essential for its accumulation in the ciliary compartment . The Rab14 GTPase localizes at early 273 endosomes and plays a role in protein exchange between the endosomes and the Golgi 274 compartment 91 – 94 , and exocytic vesicle targeting 95 . On the other hand , Rab18 is usually 275 associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets 96 , 97 . Intriguingly , we identify 276 COPI and TRAPP complex components in Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) and Gli3 interactomes , and these 277 complexes have been implicated in lipid droplet recruitment of Rab18 98 . This suggests that Gli 278 may recruit Rab18 via TRAPPII and COPI to promote ciliary trafficking . Interestingly , all three 279 of the above GTPases : Rab18 , Rab14 , and Arf4 , were recently identified as proximity 280 interactors of the cilium base - localized kinase Ttbk2 99 , strengthening the case for their 281 involvement in the targeting of Gli - laden vesicles to the cilium . 282 Finally , Rab23 had previously been implicated in Hh signaling and ciliary transport of 283 receptors 100 . Rab23 is described as a negative regulator of the Hh pathway but several 284 different mechanisms have been proposed , from affecting Smo to directly regulating Gli 285 proteins 76 , 101 , 75 . Here , we propose Rab23 as one of the key players in the trafficking of Gli 286 transcription factors into the primary cilium . This is consistent with the recently discovered 287 role of Rab23 in the transport of another soluble protein , Kif17 , to primary cilia and with the 288 ciliary and early endosome enrichment of Rab23 102 , 103 . 289 In addition to Rab family GTPases , we found Gli2 to associate with Arf4 , which functions in 290 sorting ciliary cargo at the Golgi and is a crucial regulator of ciliary receptor trafficking 104 , 105 . 291 Arf4 binds the ciliary targeting signal of rhodopsin and controls the assembly of the Rab11a - 292 Rabin8 - Rab8 module for the proper delivery of cargo to the ciliary base 106 . Although Rab8 and 293 Rab11a were found to cooperate with both the exocyst and Arf4 106 in the targeting of ciliary 294 cargos , we found that the expression of dominant - negative Rab8 and Rab11a did not 295 negatively affect Gli2 ciliary accumulation , with Rab8 DN actually promoting higher Gli2 296 accumulation in cilia ( Fig . S4B ) . Moreover , we did not find Rab8 or Rab11a among interactors 297 of Gli2 and Gli3 in our co - IP / MS datasets . Instead , among Gli2 interactors was a Rab11a 298 ortholog Rab11b , which had also been implicated in ciliogenesis and found to associate with 299 Rab8 107 , 108 . Disentangling the roles of the two Rab11 orthologs as well as Rab8 / Rabin8 in the 300 trafficking of soluble ciliary components will be an interesting subject for future studies . 301 The data from loss of function studies of small GTPases did not allow us to identify a known 302 source of vesicles that participated in Gli2 trafficking to cilia . Many of the implicated Rab / Arf 303 proteins had been known to associate both with Golgi - derived exocytic vesicles and with 304 plasma membrane - derived endosomes . To decipher the relative importance of these two 305 potential vesicle sources , we used pharmacological inhibitors to show that Gli2 is likely 306 delivered to cilia via endocytic vesicle trafficking rather than the canonical secretory pathway . 307 In addition to Gli2 , other soluble ciliary proteins can adopt a similar transport mechanism . 308 Specifically , we show that Lkb1 levels at primary cilia drop upon exocyst loss - of - function and 309 inhibition of endocytosis . Like Gli2 , Lkb1 associates with intracellular vesicles and interacts 310 with the exocyst . Intriguingly , Lkb1 has been shown to be able to associate directly with 311 plasma membrane phospholipids in addition to its nuclear and ciliary localization 109 . It will be 312 interesting to determine if direct phospholipid binding is important for the targeting of Lkb1 313 to vesicles and its ciliary transport and whether phospholipid and exocyst association are 314 synergistic . Incidentally , the exocyst and Lkb1 show similar specific affinity for phosphatidic 315 acid 109 , 110 . It is tempting to speculate that other proteins that rely on vesicles for ciliary 316 delivery , such as Gli2 , may also show some affinity for membrane lipids even in the absence 317 of exocyst tethering . 318 In contrast to Gli2 and Lkb1 , another soluble ciliary component Ubxn10 localizes at the cilium 319 normally in cells depleted of Sec5 or treated with dynasore . This suggests that while the 320 vesicle - mediated transport is important for the ciliary localization of some cytoplasmic 321 proteins , others use different routes of ciliary trafficking . Ubxn10 binds directly to the IFT - B 322 complex via IFT38 / CLUAP1 86 , so it may be delivered to the primary cilium with the IFT 323 particles . Alternatively , the dynamics of Ubxn10 exchange at the cilium may be slower than 324 that of Gli2 or Lkb1 , which prevents us from observing changes in its localization upon 325 dynasore treatment . Nevertheless , the lack of effect of Sec5 knockdown on Ubxn10 ciliary 326 accumulation argues against such an interpretation . 327 In summary , we describe a novel mechanism for the transport of soluble cytoplasmic proteins 328 to primary cilia , which relies on the association of these proteins with dynamically cycling 329 endocytic vesicles . While we identify several key players in the ciliary trafficking of these 330 vesicles , further work will dissect the precise sequence of events that are involved in this 331 process . In particular , it will be interesting to discover potential similarities and differences 332 between the canonical ciliary targeting pathways for membrane proteins , such as polycystin 333 2 , fibrocystin , Smo , and rhodopsin with those described here for soluble ciliary proteins . Our 334 work brings us closer to gaining a broad understanding of ciliary trafficking and the 335 coordinated transport of proteins among membrane compartments . 336 Acknowledgments 337 We would like to thank Marta Miączyńska , Małgo rzata Maksymowicz , Jarosław Cendrowski , 338 and the members of the CeNT Bio PI discussion group , and the Laboratory of Molecular and 339 Cellular Signalling for insightful discussion and helpful suggestions .

Mick 124 ) were cultured in DMEM / F - 12 369 ( Gibco ) media supplemented with 2mM stable glutamine ( Biowest ) , 10 % fetal bovine serum 370 ( EurX ) , and penicillin / streptomycin solution ( Thermo ) . HA - Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) and HA - LKB1 NIH / 3T3 371 and mIMCD3 stable cell lines were generated using the Flp - In system according to the 372 manufacturer’s protocols ( Thermo Fisher ) . Stable cell lines were reselected with hygromycin 373 on every other passage to preserve selection pressure . 374 To stimulate ciliogenesis the cells were cultured in the same medium but containing 0 . 5 % FBS 375 for 24h before fixing . For activation of the Hh pathway , we used SAG ( Smoothened agonist ) 376 treatment 200nM for 24h . Transient transfections of cells we performed using the JetPrime 377 reage nt ( Polyplus ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . 378 All inhibitors were suspended in DMSO and used with indicated times . The following 379 concentrations of inhibitors were used : dynasore ( 40µM , Sigma ) , endosidin2 ( 200µM , Sigma ) , 380 pitstop2 ( 30µM , Sigma ) , brefeldin A ( 5µg / ml , Sigma ) . 381 Large scale co - IP / MS on Gli3 382 NIH / 3T3 cells were cultured to confluence on 50 15cm dishes and starved overnight to 383 promote ciliogenesis . They were treated with 100nM SAG for 4h . The cells were fractionated 384 into “ nuclear ” and “ cytoplasmic ” fractions as previously described 125 . Briefly , cells were 385 washed 2x with ice - cold PBS and 2x with ice - cold 10mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 . They were left on ice 386 in 10mM HEPES for 10 min . to swell . The HEPES buffer was removed and the cells were scraped 387 in ice - cold SEAT ( sucrose , EDTA , acetic acid , triethanolamine ) buffer with protease and 388 phosphatase inhibitors and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer with nuclei release and 389 integrity monitored microscopically . “Nuclear” and “cytoplasmic” fractions w ere separated 390 using two rounds of centrifugation at 900xg for 5 min . at 4°C . The supernatant from the first 391 centri fugation was collected as the “cytoplasmic” fraction , and the pellet from the first 392 centrifugation was resuspended in SEAT buffer and centrifuged again . The pellet from the 393 second centrifugation was collected as the “nuclear” fraction . The “cytoplasmic” fraction was 394 supplemented with Tris ( to a concentration of 50mM ) , NaCl ( to a concentration of 150mM ) , 395 Nonidet P - 40 ( to a concentration of 2 % ) , sodium deoxycholate ( to a concentration of 0 . 25 % ) , 396 DTT ( to a concentration of 1mM ) , and protease inhibitors and incubated for 45 min . at 4°C . 397 Afterwards , the “cytoplasmic” lysate was centrifuged at 20 , 000xg for 45 min , and the 398 supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation . The “nuclear” pellet was lysed for 45 min in 399 a buffer containing 50mM Tris , 150mM NaCl , 2 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 25 sodium deoxycholate , 400 1mM DTT , and protease and phosphatase inhibitors . The “nuclear” lysate was cleared by 401 centrifugation at 20 , 000xg for 30 min . at 4°C and used for immunoprecipitation . Each fraction 402 was immunoprecipitated overnight with 150µL Dynabeads - Protein G ( Invitrogen ) covalently 403 cross - linked with goat - anti - Gli3 ( AF3690 ; R & D Systems ; 30µg antibody per fraction ) . The 404 beads were washed with the following buffers : harsh RIPA lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 405 150mM NaCl , 2 % Nonidet P - 40 , 500mM LiCl , 1mM DTT , 0 . 25 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % 406 SDS , protease and phosphatase inhibitors ) , RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with 0 . 8M urea , 407 and mild 0 . 1 % NP - 40 lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1mM 408 DTT , 1 % glycerol , phosphatase inhibitors ) . The samples were eluted from beads using 409 preheated 2x Laemmli sample buffer without DTT at 85°C for 5 min . The samples were then 410 reduced and alkylated using DTT and iodoacetamide and loaded onto a 6 % SDS - PAGE gel . The 411 gel was stained using the GelCode Blue reagent ( Pierce ) and prominent bands were excised 412 using a sterile scalpel and submitted for further processing to MS Bioworks ( Ann Arbor , MI ) . 413 The bands were destained and subjected to in - gel digest using trypsin . Each gel digest was 414 analyzed by nano LC / MS / MS with a Waters NanoAcquity HPLC system interfaced to a 415 ThermoFisher LTQ Orbitrap Velos . Peptides were loaded on a trapping column and eluted over 416 a 75µm analytical column at 350nL / min ; both columns were packed with Jupiter Proteo resin 417 ( Phenomenex ) . The mass spectrometer was operated in data - dependent mode , with MS 418 performed in the Orbitrap at 60 , 000 FWHM resolution and MS / MS performed in the LTQ . The 419 fifteen most abundant ions were selected for MS / MS . Data were searched using a local copy 420 of Mascot with the following parameters : Enzyme : Trypsin , Database : IPI Mouse v3 . 75 421 ( forward and reverse appended with common contaminants ) , Fixed modification : 422 Carbamidomethyl ( C ) , Variable modifications : Oxidation ( M ) , Acetyl ( N - term , K ) , Pyro - Glu ( N - 423 term Q ) , Deamidation ( N , Q ) , Phospho ( S , T , Y ) , GlyGly ( K ) , Mass values : Monoisotopic , Peptide 424 Mass Tolerance : 10 ppm , Fragment Mass Tolerance : 0 . 5 Da , Max Missed Cleavages : 2 . Mascot 425 DAT files were parsed into the Scaffold algorithm for validation , filtering , and to create a 426 nonredundant list per sample . Data were filtered using a minimum protein value of 90 % , a 427 minimum peptide value of 50 % ( Prophet scores ) , and requiring at least two unique peptides 428 per protein . 429 To determine high - confidence Gli3 interactors , we rejected all proteins found in more than 430 10 % of negative control affinity purification / MS experiments in the CRAPome database 126 431 ( FDR < 10 % ) . Enrichment of proteins representing specific Gene Ontology terms was 432 performed using PANTHER with GO - Slim Cellular Component and GO - Slim Biological Process 433 terms 127 . 434 Large scale co - IP / MS on HA - Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) in ciliated and non - ciliated cells 435 NIH / 3T3 cells stably expressing HA - Gli2 ( P1 - 6A ) were transduced either with the control vector 436 or with a retroviral vector encoding the dominant - negative variant of Kif3a ( headless – amino 437 acids 441 - 701 of the mouse Kif3a ; dnKif3a ) and selected with puromycin to eliminate 438 untransduced cells . Each cell line was expanded from a single clone and ciliogenesis or lack 439 thereof was verified by immunofluorescence . 440 Both cell lines were starved for 36h and lysed in a gentle lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 441 150mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 5 % glycerol , protease and phosphatase inhibitors ) and 442 scraped at 4°C . The lysate was clarified for 30min at 15 , 000xg and the supernatant was 443 immunoprecipitated for 2h at 4°C with Dynabeads - protein G covalently coupled to the rat 444 anti - HA antibody ( Roche ) . The beads were washed 3x5 min . with the lysis buffer and 1x5min 445 with the lysis buffer with the addition of 350mM NaCl ( total NaCl concentration 500mM ) . 446 Protein was eluted from beads using 2x Laemmli sample buffer at 37°C for 30min with 447 vigorous mixing ( 500rpm ) . 448 Eluted proteins were submitted for mass spectrometric protein identification to MS Bioworks 449 ( Ann Arbor , MI ) . The entire amount of sample was separated ~ 1 . 5cm on a 10 % Bis - Tris Novex 450 mini - gel ( Invitrogen ) using the MES buffer system . The gels were stained with coomassie and 451 excised into ten equally sized segments . Gel segments were processed using a robot ( ProGest , 452 DigiLab ) with the following protocol : Washed with 25mM ammonium bicarbonate followed 453 by acetonitrile . Reduced with 10mM dithiothreitol at 60°C followed by alkylation with 50mM 454 iodoacetamide at RT . Digested with trypsin ( Promega ) at 37°C for 4h . Quenched with formic 455 acid and the supernatant was analyzed directly without further processing . 456 The gel digests were analyzed by nano LC / MS / MS with a Waters M - class HPLC system 457 interfaced to a ThermoFisher Fusion Lumos . Peptides were loaded on a trapping column and 458 eluted over a 75µm analytical column at 350nL / min ; both columns were packed with Luna C18 459 resin ( Phenomenex ) . A 30min gradient was employed ( 5h LC / MS / MS per sample ) . The mass 460 spectrometer was operated in data - dependent mode , with MS and MS / MS performed in the 461 Orbitrap at 60 , 000 FWHM resolution and 15 , 000 FWHM resolution , respectively . APD was 462 turned on . The instrument was run with a 3s cycle for MS and MS / MS . Data were searched 463 using a local copy of Mascot with the following parameters : Enzyme : Trypsin , Database : 464 Swissprot Mouse ( concatenated forward and reverse plus common contaminants ) , Fixed 465 modification : Carbamidomethyl ( C ) , Variable modifications : Oxidation ( M ) , Acetyl ( Protein N - 466 term ) , Deamidation ( NQ ) , Mass values : Monoisotopic , Peptide Mass Tolerance : 10 ppm , 467 Fragment Mass Tolerance : 0 . 02 Da , Max Missed Cleavages : 2 . Mascot DAT files were parsed 468 into the Scaffold software for validation , filtering , and to create a nonredundant list per 469 sample . Data were filtered at 1 % protein and peptide level FDR and requiring at least two 470 unique peptides per protein . 471 Viral transduction 472 For lentivirus production , we transfected HEK293T cells with pRSV - rev , pMDLg / pRRE , pMD2 . G 473 lentiviral packaging vectors ( addgene , Tab . 1 ) and the construct encoding our protein or 474 shRNA or sgRNA of interest , and then after 2 days , we collected the virus - containing medium 475 and added it to target cells . We used puromycin to select transduced cells . 476 siRNA mediated knockdown 477 For siRNA - mediated knockdown of Sec5 , we used the Sec5 ON - TARGET plus siRNA set of four 478 siRNAs with non - targeting controls ( Horizon Dharmacon ) . For siRNA transfection , we used 479 Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Thermofisher ) . Each siRNA was introduced at 40 pmol / well on a 24 - 480 well plate for 48h . 481 shRNA mediated knockdown 482 shRNAs were cloned into pLKO . 1 - TRC cloning vector ( Tab . 1 ) .

After low - serum starvation to promote ciliogenesis , 494 we fixed cells in 4 % [ w / v ] paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15min at room temperature ( RT ) and 495 then washed 3 x 10min in phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) . Subsequently , cells were blocked and 496 permeabilized in 5 % [ w / v ] donkey serum in 0 . 2 % [ w / v ] Triton X - 100 in PBS . We incubated cells 497 with the primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C . Next , we washed the 498 coverslips 3 x 10min with 0 . 05 % [ w / v ] Triton X - 100 in PBS , followed by incubation with 499 secondary antibodies in the blocking buffer for 1 hour at RT . Cells were washed as above and 500 mounted onto slides using a fluorescent mounting medium with DAPI ( ProLong Diamond , 501 Thermo ) . We acquired images on an inverted Olympus IX - 73 fluorescent microscope equipped 502 with a 63x uPLANAPO oil objective and the Photometrics Evolve 512 Delta camera . For 503 superresolution microscopy , we used the Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope with the Airyscan 504 detector and Plan Apochromat 63x / 1 . 4 Oil DIC objective . 505 For the quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensities , images were acquired with the same 506 settings of exposure time , gain , offset , and illumination .

In cells were treated with 100nM SAG for 4h , roughly fractionated into a “cytoplasmic” and “nuclear” fraction , and each fraction was pulled down using magnetic beads coated with the anti - Gli3 antibody . Proteins were resolved on SDS - PAGE , the gel was stained with coomassie brilliant blue and prominent bands were excised for mass spectrometry - based protein ID . Shown is the image of the coomassie - stained gel with each of the excised bands indicated and numbered . Gli3 is enriched in bands 1 ( “cytoplasmic” ) and 2 ( “nuclear” ) . ( B ) MS - identified proteins from all bands were pooled and common MS - AP contaminants ( > 10 % FDR from the CRAPome database 30 ) were removed . PANTHER 103 was used to find overrepresented Gene Ontology ( GO ) terms in the “PANTHER GO – Slim Biological Process” and “PANTHER GO – Slim Cellular Component” categories . Top - level enriched GO terms are shown with their corresponding - log10 ( FDR ) values . ( C ) High confidence Gli3 interactors identified by MS were connected into a network using the STRING 106 plugin in Cytoscape . Shown is the main protein network with the node color representing the approximate relative abundance of the protein in the Gli3 interactome and the edge thickness corresponding to the confidence of connection between proteins in the STRING database . Also shown are highly interconnected sub - networks identified using MCODE clustering , which typically corresponds to protein complexes or multiprotein functional units . ( D ) The exocyst complex struc - ture ( PDB ID : 5yfp ref 26 ) was rendered using Illustrate 107 with each subunit colored according to its abundance in Gli3 IP / MS as in C .
