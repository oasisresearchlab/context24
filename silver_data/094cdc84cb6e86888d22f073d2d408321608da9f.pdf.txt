Nanes‡ ¶ From the ‡ Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism , Emory University School of Medicine and Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Atlanta , Georgia 30033 and the § Department of Cell Biology , University of Massachusetts Medical School , Worcester , Massachusetts 01655 The transcription factor RUNX2 ( Cbfa1 / AML3 / Pebp - 2 (cid:1) A ) is a critical regulator of osteoblast differentiation . We investigated the effect of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (cid:1) ( TNF ) on the expression of RUNX2 because TNF is known to inhibit differentiation of osteoblasts from pluripotent progenitor cells . TNF treatment of fetal calvaria precursor cells or MC3T3 - E1 clonal pre - osteoblastic cells caused a dose - dependent suppression of RUNX2 steady state mRNA as measured by reverse transcription - PCR . The IC 50 for TNF inhibi - tion was 0 . 6 ng / ml . TNF suppression of RUNX2 mRNA was confirmed using Northern analysis . The effect of TNF was studied using isoform - specific primers that flanked unique regions of two major RUNX2 isoforms . TNF suppressed expression of the mRNA coding for the shorter MRIPV isoform by > 90 % while inhibiting ex - pression of the mRNA for the longer MASNS isoform by 50 % . RUNX2 nuclear content was evaluated by electro - phoretic mobility shift assay using a rat osteocalcin pro - moter binding sequence as probe and by Western anal - ysis . TNF reduced nuclear RUNX2 protein . Inhibition of new protein synthesis with cycloheximide failed to pre - vent TNF inhibition of RUNX2 mRNA , suggesting that a newly translated protein did not mediate the TNF effect . RUNX2 mRNA half - life was 1 . 8 h and reduced to 0 . 9 h by TNF . The effect of TNF on RUNX2 gene transcription was evaluated using a 0 . 6 - kb RUNX2 promoter - lucifer - ase reporter in MC3T3 - E1 cells . TNF caused a dose - de - pendent inhibition of transcription to 50 % of control values . The inhibitory effect of TNF was preserved with deletions to nucleotide (cid:2) 108 upstream of the transla - tional start site ; however , localization downstream of nucleotide (cid:2) 108 was obscured by loss of basal activity . Our results indicate that TNF regulates RUNX2 expres - sion at multiple levels including destabilization of mRNA and suppression of transcription . The dispropor - tionate inhibition of RUNX2 nuclear protein suggests that additional post - transcriptional mechanisms may be occurring . Suppression of RUNX2 by TNF may decrease osteoblast differentiation and inhibit bone formation in TNF excess states . The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor - (cid:1) ( TNF ) 1 has been shown to contribute to bone loss through a variety of mechanisms that increase bone resorption and decrease bone formation . TNF has a major role as an inflammatory mediator in rheumatoid arthritis where increased bone resorption causes periarticular bone loss , and in postmenopausal osteopo - rosis in which there is generalized bone loss ( 1 – 5 ) . In addition to the effects of TNF on bone resorption , TNF also inhibits the bone - forming function of osteoblasts . In mature osteoblasts TNF inhibits the expression of the skeletal matrix proteins type I collagen and osteocalcin , causes resistance to the genomic action of 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D 3 , and increases the production of matrix metalloproteinases and pathologic para - crine factors ( 6 – 11 ) . We have shown previously that TNF in - hibits the differentiation of new osteoblasts from precursor cells ( 12 ) . In the presence of low concentrations of TNF , fetal calvaria precursor cells fail to form a mineralized matrix or to express the bone - specific osteocalcin gene . Similarly , clonal MC3T3 - E1 cells , which spontaneously differentiate to the os - teoblast phenotype , remain undifferentiated after TNF treat - ment and fail to form a matrix that is competent for mineralization . Osteoblasts differentiate from pluripotent precursor cells that have the capacity to become adipocytes , skeletal muscle cells , tendon , or fibroblasts ( 13 – 17 ) . During differentiation , a program of gene expression occurs that is characterized by sequential steps of proliferation , phenotype selection , skeletal gene expression , and finally apoptosis ( 18 ) . A number of hor - monal , paracrine , and autocrine signals regulate the steps that promote differentiation along an osteoblastic trajectory , rather than the selection of other cell phenotypes . The way in which TNF inhibits the program of osteoblast differentiation is un - known but could involve suppression of a critical regulator . RUNX2 ( Cbfa1 / AML3 / Pebp2 (cid:1) A ) is a runt related transcrip - tion factor that is essential for osteoblast differentiation ( 19 – 22 ) . RUNX2 regulates the expression of several osteoblastic genes including (cid:1) 1 ( I ) collagen , osteopontin , bone sialoprotein , and the skeletal - specific osteocalcin gene ( 23 , 24 ) . The binding of nuclear RUNX2 to osteoblast - specific elements up - regulates skeletal genes and consequently the osteoblast phenotype . Mice engineered as nullizygous for both RUNX2 alleles are born with a completely cartilaginous skeleton ( 21 ) . These ex - periments established the requirement for RUNX2 in osteo - blast differentiation during embryogenesis .

In addition , glucocorticoids may modulate RUNX2 at the levels of mRNA and protein expression ( 25 – 30 ) . In the adult , osteoblasts are recruited from pluripotent stem cells during a continuous remodeling and repair process that recapitulates ontogenic events ; thus , factors that regulate RUNX2 are important dur - ing development and in the mature skeleton . Here we hypoth - esize that TNF inhibits osteoblast differentiation , in part , through suppression of RUNX2 expression . The regulation of RUNX2 by TNF could diminish recruitment of osteoblast pre - cursors into the pool of mature bone - forming cells and contrib - ute toward inhibition of bone formation in TNF - excess states such as rheumatoid arthritis and menopause .

The pSV40 (cid:2) - galactosidase plasmid was purchased from Promega . Fetal Rat Calvaria Cultures— The Emory University and Veterans Affairs Medical Center animal use committee approved all procedures . Timed pregnant Sprague - Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories ( Wilmington , MA ) . Cultures of primary and second - ary fetal rat calvaria cells were prepared as described previously ( 12 ) . MC3T3 - E1 Cell Cultures— The clonal osteoblastic cell line MC3T3 - E1 , clone 14 , was kindly provided by Dr . Rene Franceschi ( University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI ) . This cell line has been described extensively ( 32 ) . Stock cultures were grown in MEM (cid:3) 10 % FBS without L - ascor - bate to maintain the cells in an undifferentiated state . For experiments , cells were plated in MEM (cid:3) 10 % FBS and differentiation was initiated by adding 50 (cid:4) g / ml L - ascorbate at the desired time and 10 m M (cid:2) - glyc - erophosphate on day 8 to promote mineralization . Northern Analysis and RT - PCR— Total cellular RNA was prepared from fetal rat calvaria or MC3T3 - E1 cultures by adding TRIzol ® ( 1 ml / well of a six - well plate or 1 ml / 60 - mm plate ) to lyse the cells . Chloroform was added ( 0 . 2 ml / sample ) to separate the aqueous and organic phases , followed by precipitation of the RNA with isopropanol ( 0 . 5 ml / sample ) . Northern analysis for RUNX2 was carried out by fractionating total RNA in a 2 . 2 M formaldehyde gel followed by capil - lary transfer to Zeta - Probe membrane . Cbfa1 / RUNX2 mRNA species were detected using a cDNA probe spanning the mouse RUNX2 se - quence nucleotides 670 : 1050 that included the RUNT homology domain ( GenBank (cid:1) accession no . AF010284 ) after random primer labeling with [ 32 P ] dCTP . Membranes were stripped and re - hybridized with a human glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe . mRNA band intensity was quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) and results were calculated for each time point as RUNX2 / glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase and nor - malized to the control sample . Semiquantitative RT - PCR was carried out using 0 . 5 (cid:4) g of total cellular RNA / reaction . Preliminary experi - ments determined the optimum PCR cycle number within the linear range of amplification for each gene being measured . The primers used are shown in Table I . [ 32 P ] dCTP - labeled PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 15 % polyacrylamide gel . Results were quanti - tated using the PhosphorImager and corrected for 18 S RNA amplified from the same samples in the PCR reaction . The following primers were used for RT - PCR . Primers spanning the conserved RUNT homology domain used for RUNX2 semiquantitative PCR ( 5 (cid:2)(cid:4) 3 (cid:2) ) were Cbfa1 forward ( CCAGATGGGACTGTGGTTACC ) and Cbfa1 reverse ( ACTT - GGTGCAGAGTTCAGGG ) . Isoform - specific primers as labeled in Fig . 3 were P1 / MASNS isoform forward primer 1 ( ATGCTTCATTCGCCTCA - CAAAC ) , reverse primer 2 ( AGTCCCTCCTTTTTTTTCCAG ) , and P2 / MRIPV isoform forward primer 5 ( ATGCGTATTCCTGTAGATCCG - AG ) and reverse primer 6 ( CATCATTCCCGGCCATGACGGTAAC ) . Transient Transfection and Transcription Assays— MC3T3 - E1 cells were plated at 200 , 000 cells / 2 . 0 ml / well in six - well plates in MEM (cid:3) 10 % FBS ( 3 wells / group ; plating (cid:5) day 0 ) . Cultures were transiently transfected on day 1 using Effectene according to the following protocol . The medium was aspirated , each well was washed once with 1 . 5 ml of calcium / magnesium - free D - PBS , and MEM (cid:3) 10 % FBS ( 2 . 0 ml / well ) was added to each well . Transfection mixtures for each well contained 0 . 55 (cid:4) g of pCbfa1 ( (cid:1) 600 ) LUC ( the RUNX2 promoter reporter ) , 0 . 125 (cid:4) g of pSV40 (cid:2) - Gal , and an amount of filler plasmid to equalize total DNA / well to 0 . 8 (cid:4) g . Plasmids were diluted into Qiagen Buffer EC to bring the total volume to 100 (cid:4) l for each well , and 6 . 4 (cid:4) l of Enhancer and 8 (cid:4) l of Effectene were added to the mixtures according to the manufacturer’s instructions . MEM (cid:3) 10 % FBS ( 0 . 5 ml / well ) was added to each reaction mixture and the transfection mix was applied dropwise to each well while swirling the plate . TNF was added 3 h after transfection without removing the transfection mixture . The medium was changed on day 2 , adding MEM (cid:3) 10 % FBS and fresh TNF . Cell lysates were prepared on day 3 by aspirating the medium , washing each well once with 1 . 5 ml of calcium / magnesium - free D - PBS , and adding 150 (cid:4) l of 100 m M potas - sium phosphate , pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 m M DTT . Lysates were frozen at (cid:1) 70 °C . After thawing , the lysates were centrifuged at 13 , 000 (cid:6) g for 4 min at 4 °C . The supernatants were assayed for luciferase and (cid:2) - galactosidase according to the instructions provided with the reagent kit for each enzyme . Electromobility Shift Assays— Nuclear extracts of MC3T3 - E1 cells were prepared by sequential hypotonic cell lysis and high salt extrac - tion of nuclei as described previously ( 33 ) . Extracts were stored at (cid:1) 70 °C in single use aliquots . Protein was measured using the Bio - Rad version of the Bradford dye - binding assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard . Double - stranded DNA probes were end - labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ (cid:3) - 32 P ] ATP . Binding of nuclear proteins to the labeled DNA probes was carried out using standard gel shift meth - ods and detected using autoradiography ( 33 ) . Western Blots— Nuclear extracts ( 5 (cid:4) g protein / lane ) were separated by SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions using a 10 % acrylamide gel and a discontinuous buffer system and proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes . The Western blot was devel - oped using the standard protocol for the ECL Plus immunodetection kit . The AML - 3 ( RUNX2 ) primary antibody ( no cross - reactivity to AML - 1 or AML - 2 ) was diluted to 2 . 5 (cid:4) g / ml in the ECL Plus blocking solution , and donkey anti - rabbit IgG - horseradish peroxidase was diluted to 1 : 5000 in calcium / magnesium - free D - PBS (cid:3) 0 . 1 % Tween 20 . The reactive protein bands were detected using the fluorescence - scanning feature of the Storm PhosphorImager . Statistics— Analysis of variance was used to determine statistical differences between groups . Multiple comparisons between individual groups were assessed by the method of Tukey . Comparisons of multiple groups to a single control were done according to the method of Dunnet . For comparison of mRNA half - life curves , replicate values from control or TNF - treated groups were compared at single time points by Stu - dent’s t test . Data were also analyzed after transformation of the expo - nential decay to the natural logarithmic value . The resulting linear equations were used for statistical evaluation by comparison of the 95 % confidence intervals of the slopes . In legends , p (cid:5) NS indicates not significant ( p (cid:5) 0 . 05 ) . RUNX2 ( Cbfa1 / AML3 / Pebp2 (cid:1) A ) Expression Is Inhibited by TNF 2696 by gu e s t on A ugu s t 31 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m RESULTS Fetal rat calvaria cells derived from day 21 of gestation differentiate to osteoblasts over 14 days in culture with forma - tion of discrete nodules , mineralization , and expression of the skeletal - specific osteocalcin gene ( 12 , 14 , 34 – 36 ) . These cul - tures express RUNX2 by day 7 . Steady state mRNA levels of RUNX2 were determined by semiquantitative RT - PCR using primers flanking the highly conserved RUNT homology do - main . Fig . 1 A shows that treatment of fetal rat calvaria cells with TNF ( 10 ng / ml ) , a dose shown previously to completely inhibit differentiation in these cells , caused a 50 % decline in RUNX2 mRNA by 24 h . The inhibitory effect of TNF on RUNX2 mRNA was confirmed by Northern analysis of the sample as shown in Fig . 1 B . To further define the molecular mechanism of TNF action on RUNX2 expression , we utilized the clonal preosteoblast cell line MC3T3 - E1 . This cell line expresses RUNX2 within 48 h of plating and becomes phenotypically osteoblastic after 14 days in culture . Fig . 2 A shows the dose - dependent inhibition of RUNX2 mRNA expression by TNF , as measured by RT - PCR . The IC 50 for TNF inhibition of RUNX2 was 0 . 6 ng / ml . TNF inhibition of RUNX2 was associated with inhibition of miner - alization of the cultures , as shown in Fig . 2 B and reported previously ( 12 ) . TNF suppressed RUNX2 in MC3T3 - E1 cells 70 % ( range 50 – 80 % in four experiments ) . Multiple protein isoforms of RUNX2 have been described because of the presence of different translation start sites and additional RNA splice donor / acceptor sites . As illustrated in Fig . 3 , there are two major RNA species that are transcribed from two promoters ( P1 and P2 ) , and encode two principal isoforms with different N termini ( P1 / MASNS and P2 / MRIPV ) . Primers specific for the P1 and P2 related mRNAs were con - structed to measure the effect of TNF on steady state levels of these two major RUNX2 mRNA isoforms . Fig . 3 A shows a map of the two isoforms and the target sequences for primer ampli - fication . The top panel shows the mRNA isoform beginning from the second transcriptional start site ( P1 / MRIPV ) , and the lower panel shows the mRNA isoform originating from the first transcriptional start site ( P2 / MASNS ) . Fig . 3 B shows RT - PCR results for four individual cultures treated with or without TNF ( 10 ng / ml ) . We observed that the P1 / MASNS mRNA iso - form was reduced 50 % by TNF treatment . The P2 / MRIPV mRNA isoform was reduced (cid:4) 90 % ( Fig . 3 B ) . We observed two expected bands and one unexpected band using the P1 / MASNS - specific primer pair 1 / 2 . The P1 / MASNS - related mRNAs indicated in Fig . 3 B ( labeled b and c ) are predicted based on alternative splicing of a micro - exon in the 5 (cid:2) - untrans - lated region of the P1 / MASNS RUNX2 mRNA as reported previously ( 37 ) . The larger 380 - kb band represents an un - spliced mRNA species in which intron 1 is retained , preserving the coding sequence in frame . Isolation , subcloning , and direct sequencing confirmed the nucleotide sequence of the bands . The observed bands were not the result of genomic contamina - tion because they were absent when reverse transcriptase was excluded from the reaction mixture . In addition , DNase diges - tion of the samples failed to eliminate the bands ( data not shown ) . The P2 / MRIPV isoform primers yielded the predicted RT - PCR product ( Fig . 3 B , d ) . The P2 / MRIPV mRNA was strongly inhibited by TNF . TNF had no effect on 18 S RNA . Thus , TNF inhibited expression of both the P1 / MASNS and P2 / MRIPV mRNA isoforms at an early time point in differen - tiation . The semiquantitative RT - PCR results suggested that TNF had a more pronounced effect on the P2 / MRIPV mRNA isoform . To determine whether TNF inhibition of RUNX2 mRNA was associated with a reduction in RUNX2 protein , RUNX2 nuclear content was measured using both EMSA and Western analysis . In this way , we assessed functional RUNX2 binding to DNA and also total RUNX2 nuclear protein . MC3T3 - E1 cells were treated with or without TNF ( 10 ng / ml ) for 24 h . Nuclear extract was isolated , and EMSA was done using a 32 P - labeled rat osteocalcin OSE2 probe to assess nuclear protein / DNA binding ( 37 ) . Fig . 4 shows that TNF decreased RUNX2 binding to the probe . RUNX2 binding was decreased after 24 h of TNF treatment but not b y 4 h ( 4 h notshown ) . The RUNX2 band was supershifted with a specific RUNX2 ( AML - 3 ) antibody in con - trol or TNF - treated cells . A control antibody to the closely F IG . 1 .

RUNX2 is a phosphoprotein regulated via the mitogen - acti - vated protein kinase pathway . Because binding of RUNX2 to DNA could be regulated by changes in RUNX2 phosphorylation state rather than quantity , Western analysis of nuclear ex - tracts was done to directly measure RUNX2 nuclear content . Fig . 5 shows that TNF treatment ( 10 ng / ml ) inhibited nuclear RUNX2 protein after 24 h of treatment , but not by 4 h , a finding consistent with results from the EMSA . We found that TNF caused a (cid:4) 90 % inhibition of nuclear RUNX2 by Western analysis . TNF could inhibit expression of RUNX2 by affecting mRNA stability or through transcriptional suppression . To determine which of these mechanisms were occurring , the effect of TNF on RUNX2 mRNA stability was measured after treating cells with actinomycin D to inhibit new RNA synthesis . The decay of pre - formed RUNX2 mRNA was measured using RT - PCR in cells pre - treated with TNF for 2 h . Fig . 6 shows that the RUNX2 mRNA has a short half - life calculated as 1 . 8 – 2 . 3 h ( range of three experiments ) . Treatment with TNF caused a decrease in RUNX2 half - life to 0 . 9 h , which was apparent at 1 h after TNF treatment . To determine whether the inhibitory effect of TNF on RUNX2 steady state mRNA requires new protein synthesis , MC3T3 - E1 cells were treated with cycloheximide for 2 h prior to addition of TNF ( 10 ng / ml , 24 h ) and RUNX2 mRNA was measured by RT - PCR . The addition of cycloheximide reduced the steady state mRNA level of RUNX2 ; however , the concurrent treatment of TNF (cid:3) cycloheximide still caused a 50 % inhibition of RUNX2 mRNA compared with cycloheximide alone ( Fig . 7 ) . These results are consistent with a direct effect of TNF ( or the TNF - stimulated signal transduction pathway ) on the RUNX2 gene without the need for new protein synthesis . The effect of TNF on RUNX2 gene transcription was studied using a reporter that included 0 . 6 kb of the rat RUNX2 pro - moter ( exon - 1 start site ) fused to the firefly luciferase gene ( (cid:1) 600pCbfa - 1LUC ) . Previous work has shown that this region of the promoter is sufficient to confer transcriptional activation ( 31 ) . The effect of TNF treatment on the (cid:1) 600pCbfa - 1LUC construct is shown in Fig . 8 . TNF treatment for 24 h caused a dose dependent inhibition of transcription with an estimated IC 50 between 0 . 1 and 1 ng / ml , similar to the IC 50 for TNF inhibition of steady state mRNA and osteoblast differentiation . The effect of 5 (cid:2) - deletions of the promoter on basal transcription is shown in Fig . 9 A and confirms the previously described repressor region between (cid:1) 351 to (cid:1) 458 in studies done with F IG . 4 .

The effect of TNF on transcription of (cid:1) 600pCbfa - 1LUC deletion constructs is shown in Fig . 9 B . It can be seen that the inhibitory effect of TNF ( 10 ng / ml , 24 h ) is observed with deletions to at least nucleotide (cid:1) 108 of the start site . The low basal transcription rate of the constructs between (cid:1) 108 and the start site precluded further mapping of the TNF - responsive region ; however , this region appears to be located close to the proximal promoter or in the 5 (cid:2) - untranslated region . DISCUSSION Our results show that TNF suppresses the expression of RUNX2 in pre - osteoblastic cells . We considered that TNF could decrease RUNX2 by regulating gene transcription , mRNA sta - bility , protein translation , or compartmentalization and half - life of the protein . Although not addressed here , phosphoryla - tion of RUNX2 may also influence its potency as a transcription factor and potentially its stability ( 38 , 39 ) . We found that the mechanism of TNF inhibition of RUNX2 includes some desta - bilization of the mRNA and also suppression of transcription , because TNF inhibited activity of the RUNX2 promoter . Tran - scriptional control of RUNX2 may have rapid effects on RUNX2 availability , given the short half - life of the mRNA . The RUNX2 promoter has two transcriptional start sites that are regulated by two promoters ( P1 and P2 ) . The upstream P1 promoter generates three different mRNA isoforms that differ in micro - splicing events involving a mini - intron in the 5 (cid:2) - untranslated region ( 40 ) . Two putative translation start sites have been observed for the mRNAs originating from the P1 promoter , and these sites produce proteins starting with MLHSP or MASNS peptides . However , only one of these ( MASNS ) is efficiently utilized for translation ( 41 ) , a conclusion corroborated by the observation that high titer antibodies against the MLHSP antibodies fail to detect a protein in osse - ous cell lysates . 2 Thus , our PCR primers detect the two major mRNA transcripts that are translated to MASNS and MRIPV protein isoforms . Additional alternative splicing events in the 3 (cid:2) end of RUNX2 mRNAs may further increase protein diversity and account for other bands generated using the most 3 (cid:2) PCR primers in our studies ( 42 ) . The MRIPV isoform is regulated by the downstream P2 promoter ( 44 ) . The MRIPV isoform is more ubiquitously expressed in bone , testes , thymus , and liver but nevertheless retains transcriptional activation potency for a number of skeletal genes ( 43 – 45 ) . The role that each isoform has in regulating osteoblast differentiation remains to be de - termined . The P2 / MRIPV isoform appears to be expressed more constitutively and at an early time point in mesenchymal plu - ripotent precursor cells , whereas expression of the P1 / MASNS isoform is increased at a later time as the precursor cells become committed to the osteoblast phenotype ( 45 ) . Our data show that the levels of expression of both the P1 and P2 promoter products are down - regulated by TNF , but the mag - nitude of inhibition differs between these mRNA species . The 2 A .

RUNX2 ( Cbfa1 / AML3 / Pebp2 (cid:1) A ) Expression Is Inhibited by TNF 2699 by gu e s t on A ugu s t 31 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m mRNA encoding the P2 ( MRIPV ) isoform was almost com - pletely inhibited by TNF , whereas the P1 ( MASNS ) isoform was inhibited only 50 % . This differential regulation suggests that the almost complete suppression of the P2 / MRIPV form of RUNX2 by TNF blocks selection of the osteoblast phenotype very early in differentiation of the pluripotent precursor cell . TNF may preferentially inhibit selection of the P2 / MRIPV transcriptional start site , a mechanism that would account for the differential mRNA isoform suppression . Alternatively , the different mRNA species could have different half - lives ; how - ever , in half - life experiments done using isoform - specific prim - ers , the same decrease in mRNA half - life was observed for both P1 and P2 products after treatment with TNF ( data not shown ) . Our analysis of the P1 promoter reveals that the inhi - bition of the P1 ( MASNS ) levels is at least in part mediated by a transcriptional mechanism , reflected by a 2 - fold down - regu - lation of P1 promoter activity following TNF treatment . Treatment of cells with cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis did not block the effect of TNF on RUNX2 mRNA , suggesting that the effect of TNF on RUNX2 gene transcription does not require synthesis of a new TNF - induced intermediary protein . Rather , TNF may regulate RUNX2 transcription through a more rapid signal cascade that directly influences the RUNX2 promoter . Candidates for TNF - induced signals in - clude activation of NF (cid:6) B , AP - 1 transcription factors , or changes in mitogen - activated protein kinases , nitric oxide , sig - nal transducers and activators of transcription , or in the cer - amide pathway ( 46 ) . Determining which of these is involved in RUNX2 regulation will require additional studies . Using both EMSA and Western analysis , we found that TNF reduced nuclear RUNX2 levels at 24 but not 4 h . Thus , a decrease in nuclear RUNX2 protein follows the decrease in mRNA , as expected . We found a discrepancy between the 50 – 70 % reduction in steady state mRNA , as measured by primers flanking the common RUNT homology domain , and the (cid:4) 90 % reduction in nuclear RUNX2 protein , as measured by Western analysis . Because the TNF reduction in nuclear RUNX2 pro - tein was greater than expected compared with the decrease in total RUNX2 mRNA species , TNF may also have post - tran - scriptional effects . Direct measurement of specific protein iso - forms of RUNX2 awaits the availability of isoform - specific antibodies . The RUNX2 promoter is highly conserved among rat , mouse , and human . The rat distal promoter is 95 % homologous to mouse and 94 % to human , whereas the proximal rat promoter is 100 % homologous to mouse and 97 % homologous to the human sequence ( 31 ) . The major difference in promoter struc - ture between species is variability in the length of two purine - rich regions of unknown function . We studied the effect of TNF on the rat RUNX2 promoter using a reporter that included 0 . 6 kb of rat DNA sequence upstream of the MASNS translation start site . The 0 . 6 kb of DNA has been shown to support basal transcription of this promoter and to contain numerous poten - tial regulatory sequences including a repressor region at nu - cleotides (cid:1) 351 to (cid:1) 458 . Negative auto - regulation by RUNX2 is also a feature of this promoter . The promoter contains homol - ogous NF (cid:6) B and AP - 1 binding sites located between (cid:1) 500 and (cid:1) 300 that could confer responsiveness to TNF . We found that the basal transcriptional activity in MC3T3 - E1 cells was al - most identical to that described previously in osteoblastic ROS 17 / 2 . 8 cells and similar to the activity in NIH3T3 cells ( 31 ) . Our data revealed a dose - dependent inhibition of promoter activity by TNF with an IC 50 similar to the inhibition of steady state RUNX2 mRNA . Interestingly , the IC 50 was also similar to that observed for TNF inhibition of osteoblast differentiation ( 12 ) . Progressive deletions of the RUNX2 promoter showed that the inhibitory effect of TNF was maintained at least to nucleotide (cid:1) 108 upstream of the start site . These results exclude the NF (cid:6) B and AP - 1 - like binding sites between nucleotides (cid:1) 500 and (cid:1) 300 as regions that could confer TNF action . Because additional deletions of the more proximal promoter were asso - ciated with loss of basal transcriptional activity , we were un - able to further localize the TNF - responsive region . Additional studies will be needed to precisely determine a TNF - response sequence . The level of RUNX2 in the nucleus is a critical determinant for selection of the pathway of osteoblast differentiation . Thus , the suppression of RUNX2 nuclear protein that we observed is likely to be important for differentiating cells . This is supported by the observation that RUNX2 haploin - sufficiency , which should be associated with a 50 % decrement in RUNX2 protein , is sufficient to cause the disorder cleido - cranial dysplasia ( 47 , 48 ) .
