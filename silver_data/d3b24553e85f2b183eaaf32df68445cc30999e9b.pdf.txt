Until recently , like in most developmental sys - tems , the process of gene expression in the Drosoph - ila embryo has been mainly monitored by in situ hybridization detecting mRNA on ﬁ xed samples , using radioactive 8 or ﬂ uorescent 9 , 10 complementary RNA probes . Combined with genetics and ef ﬁ cient imaging , this approach provided a rather exhaustive insight into the precision and noise involved in the spatial regulation of gene expression and its role in patterning . 11 – 15 However , given the extremely rapid development of the embryo ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) , it became clear that approaches extracting only static clues could not provide a precise understanding of the tem - poral dynamics of transcription 15 , 16 and even more of its intrinsic molecular noise . 17 – 19 In a few cases , it has been possible to reconstitute temporal progres - sion by identifying the precise developmental stage of the samples with the help of additional quantitative markers , such as density and the size of the nuclei in the case of early development 15 , 20 or cell membrane invagination as a time scale marker during nuclear cycle ( nc ) 14 . 16 , 21 However , each case was limited by marker - dependent discrete time resolution and required the analysis of many samples for signi ﬁ cant y ( a ) ( b ) x 1 2 0 h 1 h 2 h Nuclear cycletime 1 st locus y x Fish nc11 hunchback 2 nd locus 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 y x z z y x z y x z FIGURE 1 | Detecting ongoing transcription in young Drosophilaembryos . ( a ) The young fruit ﬂ y embryo is a unique cell of ellipsoidal shape . At egg laying , the nucleus of the fertilized egg undergoes 13 rapid divisions over a two hour period . These divisions ﬁ rst occur in the center of the embryo . At nuclear cycle 6 ( nc 6 ) , nuclei start their migration from the center to the periphery of the cell and spread in a single layer at the surface of the cell to give rise after about one hour of development ( nc 8 – nc 9 ) to the syncytial blastoderm . Once at the periphery , nuclei continue to divide for 5 more rapid divisions before reaching the long nc14 during which the cellularization process occurs . The ﬁ rst hints of zygotic transcription are detected at nc8 . ( b ) On the right , nuclei ( blue , nuclear envelope labeled with WGA - AlexaFluor - 633 15 ) are visualized at the surface of the whole embryo at nc11 and on the left , a close up of expressing nuclei ( taken from the dashed square on the right ) . Expression of a given gene of interest ( here hunchback ) can be detected by RNA FISH with ﬂ uorescently labeled anti - sense RNA probes . Expression is revealed by two type of staining : speckle - like dots ( arrow heads ) corresponding to single mRNA and bright intense foci ( arrow ) corresponding to the accumulation of several nascent pre - mRNAs at their site of synthesis , as schematically diagrammed for the two hunchbackloci .

Given these limitations , there was a need to develop new methods , in which time would be a directly accessible dimension , to follow the transcrip - tion process in living organisms . The ﬁ rst steps toward this goal have recently been achieved in the very early embryo to describe the temporal dynamics of the response to the Bicoid morphogen . 22 , 23 Besides providing new insights into the Bicoid system , these recent studies provided unprecedented insight into the dynamics of the transcription process in the developing ﬂ y embryo . The goal of this review is to describe these new methods , the insights so far and the prospects . We focus on the Drosophila embryo because it was the ﬁ rst multicellular organism in which these approaches were implemented . However , there is no technical limitation that should restrict these methods to this particular model system as highlighted by their recent use in zebra ﬁ sh embryos . 24 Many of the points raised here are not speci ﬁ cally limited to the ﬂ y embryo and can be of general interest to study gene expression during development . INSIGHTS INTO GENE EXPRESSION FROM RNA FISH Despite its intrinsic limitations , the RNA ﬂ uorescent in situ hybridization ( RNA FISH ) approach has been used successfully to tackle the dynamics of gene acti - vation in syncytial nuclei or embryonic cells . Two types of ﬂ uorescent signals are generally observed in RNA FISH : ( 1 ) very small , speckle - like ﬂ uorescent signals scattered in both the nucleus and the cyto - plasm ( Figure 1 ( b ) , arrow heads ) ; ( 2 ) bright intense foci speci ﬁ cally detected in the nucleus ( Figure 1 ( b ) , arrows ) . The former are not observed with intronic probes and correspond to the detection of single mature mRNA . 25 – 28 The latter are generally observed with both intronic and non - intronic probes and thus correspond to premature mRNA . In embryos at an early stage ( before nc 14 ) , the maxi - mum number of bright foci in expressing nuclei cor - relates with the number of loci encoding the RNA that is being detected . 15 As ﬂ uorescent signals from a single mRNA are much weaker , these bright foci likely correspond to the accumulation of several nas - cent pre - mRNAs at their site of transcription in the nucleus . 15 , 16 , 26 Direct support for this assumption comes from experiments of double DNA - RNA FISH performed in cultured cells 25 or early mouse embryos 26 showing that bright foci observed with RNA - FISH in nuclei colocalize with their DNA locus . The double RNA - DNA FISH cannot been achieved on whole mount Drosophila embryos ( which are only ﬁ xed on slides at the end of the procedure ) but the converging indirect evidence mentioned above , argues that the nuclear bright dots detected by RNA - FISH directly correspond to the ongoing transcrip - tion process at each locus . Given the absence of homologue pairing in the early embryo , 29 the two sites of transcription from homologous loci in diploid embryos are generally largely distant from each other , giving rise to two signi ﬁ cantly distinguishable bright dots ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . In rare cases , four distinct bright dots corresponding to ongoing transcription at the four sister chromatids are observed in nuclei , in which the loci of interest have already been repli - cated . 26 Conveniently , as chromosomes adopt a Rabl con ﬁ guration in the early embryo with apical centro - meres and basal telomeres , the two homologous loci are generally localized in the same confocal Z - stack , which considerably facilitates image acquisition . 30 Importantly , the lack of pairing of homologous chro - mosomes in the early embryo is an exception and homologous chromosomes are generally paired in most Drosophila tissues . 29 Therefore , ongoing tran - scription in older Drosophila tissues is generally detected as a single bright nuclear dot by RNA - FISH irrespective of the homologous loci copy number . In summary , RNA - FISH in Drosophila embryos allows the detection of single mature mRNA in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus . In addition , it also allows for the detection of the accumulation of nascent premature transcripts at their site of synthesis inside the nucleus and it is thus an excellent marker to detect ongoing transcriptional activity at a given locus . 27 The observed data are consistent with a tran - scription process occurring with periods of promoter activity during which several polymerases are tran - scribing the gene . This period of activity can either be temporally continuous or discontinuous , i . e . eventually interrupted by periods of inactivity during which no polymerases initiate transcription ( Figure 2 ) . Such periods of ﬂ uctuating activity , called ‘ bursts ’ or ‘ pulses ’ of transcription , have been described in several prokaryotic and eukaryotic living systems . 33 – 37 A recent study using the MS2 approach to label RNA ( see below ) and focusing on different stages during preaggregative development in Dictyos - tellium indicates that in this system developmentally regulated genes are generally expressed in such pulses , while housekeeping genes strongly reduce the magnitude of their pulses during development pre - sumably to better tune transcription at the single - cell level . 38 In the ﬂ y embryo , bursting has recently been directly observed with a similar approach for even - skipped expression at nc 14 . 39 WIREs Developmental Biology New methods to image transcription in living ﬂ y embryos © 2016 The Authors . WIREsDevelopmentalBiologypublished by Wiley Periodicals , Inc . NOISE IN GENE EXPRESSION DURING DEVELOPMENT Gene expression is intrinsically a noisy process , which contributes to cell - to - cell variability at the pro - tein level within a homogenous population of cells . 17 , 40 Recent studies using quantitative RNA - FISH revealed that genetically identical cells in identi - cal environments can produce very different amounts of RNA ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) . 28 , 41 As these ﬂ uctuations are not correlated with any studied parameter , it is assumed that this expression is stochastic . This heter - ogeneity can be such that each cell in the population expresses a different , but constant amount of RNA over a long period of time ( time - invariant heteroge - neity ) or alternatively that the amounts of RNA pro - duced by a given cell ﬂ uctuate over the same period ( time - ﬂ uctuating heterogeneity ) . Although these two types of scenarios have very different temporal dynamics , they show almost identical distributions of RNA per cell among the population at a given time ( Figure 3 ( a ) , right ) and thus the snap - shot view pro - vided by RNA - FISH does not discriminate between these two scenarios . Mathematical modeling can be used to successfully interpret RNA - FISH data and provide evidence for transcriptional bursting , such as in the case of the endogenous c - Fos proto - oncogene regulation by transcription factors . 42 Stochasticity in the transcription process is even more important when considering the expression of developmental genes in Drosophila embryos , in which cells must integrate positional information and / or information about different environments varying in both space and time . Surprisingly , the few attempts addressing this question in Drosophila embryos indicate different mechanisms depending on the situation . In the case of the transcriptional response downstream of the Bicoid morphogen ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) , expression of the hunchback target gene monitored by RNA - FISH indicates that the two alleles of the gene are active simultaneously ( syn - chrony ) in more than 60 % of the anterior nuclei while they are completely silent in posterior nuclei . This synchrony is acquired extremely rapidly ( in less than 30 min ) and the transition zone between the two domains in which more variability is observed , spans only over 10 % of the egg length . 15 Interest - ingly , the high level of synchrony observed could sug - gest , that the transcription process at the hunchback loci at this stage of development , consists of a single pulse during each interphase , which does not ﬁ t with a bursty mode of transcription ( Figure 2 ) . Evidence for transcriptional bursting was pro - vided by analyzing expression of the Hox gene Sex combs reduced in the parasegment 2 at a slightly later stage of development 27 ( Figure 3 ( c ) ) . Interest - ingly in this case , expression of the gene is very dif - ferent among adjacent cells at a given time , with some cells exhibiting ( 1 ) low amounts of single mature mRNA but clearly detectable ongoing Time traces of gene activity ( a ) ( b ) t 1 t 2 Time A m oun t o f na sc en t m RN A t 1 t 2 Time Time t 1 Time t 2 A m oun t o f na sc en t m RN A < < Non bursting > > < < Bursting > > Snapshot of gene activity NascentmRNA PollI FIGURE 2 | Bursting or nonbursting gene activity , the two types of transcription dynamics of a promoter . A continuum between the two extreme situations portrayed here can be found for different genes . ( a ) The amount of nascent RNA produced at the promoter ﬂ uctuates around a given positive value . The RNA PolII initiates transcription at an average constant rate . The promoter is active and nonbursting . ( b ) The activity of the promoter ( measured as the amount of nascent RNA produced at a given time ) alternates between periods of strong production ( bursts ) and periods of inactivity . The promoter is bursting . The characteristics of a bursting promoter include the frequency of the bursts , the intensity of the bursts , and their duration . 31 , 32 Advanced Review wires . wiley . com / devbio © 2016 The Authors . WIREsDevelopmentalBiologypublished by Wiley Periodicals , Inc . transcription at the locus , ( 2 ) high amounts of single mature mRNA but no trace of ongoing transcription , and ( 3 ) intermediate levels of single mature mRNA as well as ongoing transcription . A quantitative anal - ysis indicated that there was no correlation between the amounts of mature mRNA and nascent mRNA per cell ( Figure 3 ( c ) , right ) arguing that the heteroge - neity observed among cells was likely time - ﬂ uctuating and that transcription in this case would occur in bursts . Importantly , the detection of bright foci at an active locus indicates that several poly - merases are transcribing the gene one after the other ( Figure 1 ( b ) , cartoons ) . This technical limitation could restrict the detection of ongoing transcription by RNA - FISH to bursty genes when compared to nonbursty genes expressed at low levels for which it would be dif ﬁ cult to distinguish single mature mRNA from single nascent pre - mRNA ( Figure 2 ) .

( a ) Hypothetical situation in which an isogenic population of cells within a homogenous environment exhibits cell - to - cell variability in the gene expression pattern at a given time . Time - invariant heterogeneity and time - ﬂ uctuating heterogeneity are two very distinct scenarios which could explain this variability . However , as at a given time the distributions of mRNA / cell are very similar for both scenarios , and thus the snapshot analysis on ﬁ xed tissues cannot provide a direct insight into the underlying transcriptional dynamics .

Transcription of hbis highly synchronous ( a majority of bi - allelic expression ) in the anterior half of the early Drosophilaembryo whereas transcription in not detected in the posterior half .

The time interval it takes for tail - upto be expressed in 50 % of the nuclei is shorter than for panier . The length of the transition period from heterogeneous to synchronous expression is anti - correlated to the amount of RNA PolII pausing at the promoter . 21 WIREs Developmental Biology New methods to image transcription in living ﬂ y embryos © 2016 The Authors . WIREsDevelopmentalBiologypublished by Wiley Periodicals , Inc . cellularization ( nc14 ) . The detection of nascent tran - scription of 14 genes using RNA - FISH indicated that some of these genes are expressed uniformly ( syn - chronously ) in most cells of the expression domain , while other genes are expressed much more heteroge - neously ( stochastically ) . 16 The analysis of a large number of embryos combined with morphological staging provided access to the dynamics of the tran - scription process throughout the cycle and indicated that while only a few genes were synchronously expressed at the onset of the cycle , most genes had acquired synchrony 30 min later ( Figure 3 ( d ) ) . The heterogeneity observed for most genes at the begin - ning of the cycle was interpreted as a transition period required for each gene to reach a coordinated expression in all cells of the expression domain . The length of this transition period is anti - correlated to the abundance of paused polymerases at promoters 16 and reciprocally , changing the amount of paused pol - ymerase modi ﬁ es the transition period required for synchronous expression . 21 Polymerase pausing appears thus critical to reduce the time it takes to reach synchrony . Whether heterogeneous expression at early cycle 14 re ﬂ ects time - invariant ( not bursting ) or time - ﬂ uctuating ( bursting ) expression remains to be clari ﬁ ed . THE FLUORESCENT TAGGING OF RNA IN LIVING EMBRYOS Although extremely powerful for single cell analysis , RNA FISH requires ﬁ xation of the sample and can thus only provide a snap - shot view of the transcrip - tion process at a given time ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) . Bene ﬁ ting from the pioneer work of R . Singer , 44 several systems have been developed to ﬂ uorescently tag RNA in liv - ing cells . These new approaches take advantage of strong interactions between a speci ﬁ c Coat Protein ( CP ) and its RNA stem loop ( SL ) generally derived from viral systems . These include the MS2 RNA SL and the MCP from the MS2 bacteriophage , 44 the PP7 RNA SL and the PCP from the PP7 bacterio - phage 45 or the Bbox SL and the λ phage N protein . 46 Provided that the ﬂ uorescently tagged CP is expressed in the cell , it will bind strongly to RNA carrying its cognate target SL ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . These RNA SL are arti ﬁ cially introduced in reporter genes and generally multimerized from 6 to 24 copies to allow the accumulation of ﬂ uorescence from bound CP above the background level . This approach has been widely used over the last decade to ﬂ uorescently label RNA in living systems . 47 It has been very useful to study the movement of asymmetrically distributed RNA during Drosophila development including oogenesis 48 , 49 or the development of the tracheal sys - tem in the larvae . 50 It has also been used in cultured cells to shed light on the mechanisms of RNA synthe - sis or processing , including the initiation , 51 , 52 elonga - tion , pausing , and termination 52 of transcription or splicing . 53 , 54 These studies provided estimates of key mechanistic parameters such as the duration of spli - cing events 53 , 54 or the elongation rate of the polymer - ase in various models . 51 , 52 Although these approaches provided an unprec - edented insight into the dynamics of the gene expres - sion process , they have limitations : First , unlike RNA - FISH , which enables one to directly detect RNA at endogenous loci , the ﬂ uores - cent tagging of RNA requires genome modi ﬁ cation and in most cases the handling of large reporter sequences . In the ﬁ rst attempts in mammalian cells , these reporter sequences were inserted in multiple copies ( up to 200 ) at a single chromosomal location to gain sensitivity . 52 , 55 However , as the heterochro - matin state of such repeats 56 could affect the tran - scriptional behavior of the transgene , 57 it is certainly wiser , when possible , to work with single - copy inser - tions . Similarly , the extent to which the insertion of an exogenous RNA reporter sequence ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) could affect the transcriptional behavior of the trans - gene or the processing of the transcript remains to be clari ﬁ ed . In particular the structure of the RNA loops could affect the polymerase elongation rate and the DNA sequence of the MS2 transgene could itself modify the initiation of transcription . Additionally , the MS2 loops could alter the mRNA lifetime . It is noteworthy that the CRISPR / Cas9 technology 58 – 60 should now allow the detection of ongoing transcrip - tion at endogenous loci and limit in part side effects from reporters . Second , a major limitation for quantitative analysis of RNA ﬂ uorescent tagging is the existence of an inherent ﬂ uorescent background , which is due to the presence of unbound or nonspeci ﬁ cally bound ﬂ uorescent CP . It is thus essential to express these ﬂ uorescent CP at low levels , the critical parameter that needs to be ﬁ nely tuned being the signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) . The signal is controlled by the number of ﬂ uorescent CP binding sites , whereas the noise or background is due to the ﬂ uorescent CP that are not bound to the RNA but freely diffusing through the cell . To diminish background without affecting too much the physical parameters of the interaction between the RNA and the ﬂ uorescent proteins so that they can remain negligible in comparison to the dynamics of the transcription process itself , an appropriate balance between ﬂ uorescent CP Advanced Review wires . wiley . com / devbio © 2016 The Authors . WIREsDevelopmentalBiologypublished by Wiley Periodicals , Inc . concentration and the amount of binding sites has to be found . This can be achieved by tight control of the ﬂ uorescent CP expression level ( using the Gal4 / UAS system or heat - shock - induced expression ) or possibly by removing the nuclear localization signal from the ﬂ uorescent CP as shown to be surprisingly ef ﬁ cient to increase the SNR . 22 Another possibility to reduce the SNR is to take advantage of bimolecular ﬂ uorescent complementa - tion ( BiFC ) , with a ﬂ uorescent protein split into two non ﬂ uorescent fragments fused to two RNA binding proteins with distinct speci ﬁ city ( e . g . , MCP / MS2 and PCP / PP7 ) . When expressed in the same cell , the two free coat proteins are not ﬂ uorescent , which allows for considerable reduction of the background ﬂ uorescent signal . A complete mature ﬂ uorescent protein is only reconstituted , when the two coat pro - teins are brought close to each other by binding to their corresponding motifs that are adjacent in the RNA . 61 The major limitation of this system is the time it takes to mature the reconstituted ﬂ uorophore ( 12 – 36 h ) and it is therefore not appropriate to image real - time transcription , which is a much more rapid process . Recently , live - imaging of transcription with almost no ﬂ uorescent background has been described . This system is based on RNA aptamers called ImageTags , which can be expressed from a given promoter in a reporter . 43 The RNAs containing a string of aptamers are ﬂ uorescently tagged when the cells are incubated with a mix of aptamer ligands - No genome modification - No / very low background - Single molecule resolution - Static view - Potential source of noise in fixation procedure Fixed embryo ( a ) ( b ) RN A F I S H M S 2 / PP 7 / λ N I M A G E t ag Living embryo - Dynamic view - Inherent background - Genome modification required - Large reporter sequences - Dynamic view Endogenous DNA sequence Ectopically inserted DNA sequence RNA reporter coding sequence RNA transcripts MS2 stem loops Fluorescent RNA probe GFP - tagged RNA - loop coating protein Fluorescent RNA aptamer ligand FRET signal RNA Polll - No / very low background - Permeabilization required - Genome modification required - Large reporter sequences - Not yet implemented in the embryo ! FIGURE 4 | Available and potential methods to ﬂ uorescently - tag nascent RNA in living embryos . ( a ) Detection of RNA in ﬁ xed embryos by RNA FISH only offers a snapshot view . However , it allows studying expression of endogenous loci without genome modi ﬁ cation . In addition , it is mostly background free and can provide single molecule resolution . The sun icon indicates advantages of the method ; the cloud indicates disadvantages . ( b ) Available live - imaging methods provide access to the temporal dynamics of the transcription process . However , they require genome editing and the insertion of exogenous RNA reporter sequences , which can potentially bias the behavior of the promoter or the processing of the RNA . In addition , so far , these methods are limited by an inherent background of ﬂ uorescent signals for quantitative analysis . This limitation can potentially be overcome by new approaches such as the IMAGEtag , which combine the tagging of the RNA with FRET . 43 WIREs Developmental Biology New methods to image transcription in living ﬂ y embryos © 2016 The Authors . WIREsDevelopmentalBiologypublished by Wiley Periodicals , Inc . conjugated to either one or the other component of a ﬂ uorescent energy transfer ( FRET ) pair , such as Cy3 or Cy5 ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . The ImageTags have not yet been used to image transcription in multicellular organisms . In ﬂ y embryos , the dif ﬁ culty to introduce the aptamer ligands without perturbing the develop - ment of the embryo will not be easy to solve . Never - theless , FRET , which is much more rapid , is probably more suitable than BiFC for imaging rapid processes such as transcription . It is certainly worth exploring the possibility to ﬂ uorescently tag RNA in living embryos using RNA coat proteins fused to ﬂ uorescent molecules that would constitute a FRET pair , to generate background free tagging of RNA . Although , this approach has not yet been developed , it could certainly provide a powerful path to the increase of the SNR . 62 THE POSITION OF THE RNA SLS INFLUENCES THE STRENGTH OF THE SIGNAL AND ITS PERSISTENCE These approaches to ﬂ uorescently tag RNA in living cells or organisms provide an almost direct access to the dynamics of promoter activity . The possibility to detect nascent mRNA in vivo simpli ﬁ es the estima - tion of the kinetics parameters , as opposed to more complex indirect inference from protein concentra - tions . However , the interpretability of the ﬂ uorescent signal depends on the details of the probe design , speci ﬁ cally the position of the RNA SL with respect to the gene sequence . In particular , in addition to the ratio of the number of bound and freely diffusing ﬂ uorescent CP molecules , the SNR also depends on the position of the RNA SLs with respect to the tran - scribed sequence . The sequence coding for the RNA SL could be inserted anywhere in the transcribed sequence . How - ever , to stay close to the natural context , it is cer - tainly better to insert them into nontranslated sequences . This could be either in the 5 0 untranslated region ( UTR ) of the transcribed sequence ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) , in introns ( Figure 5 ( b ) ) or in the 3 0 UTR of the transcribed region ( Figure 5 ( c ) ) . As shown in Figure 5 , assuming the same activity period of the promoter , these various con ﬁ gurations produce dif - ferent ﬂ uorescent time traces : ( 1 ) when the RNA SL is localized in the 5 0 UTR , a strong ﬂ uorescent signal is rapidly observed but its persistence is signi ﬁ cantly longer than the activity period of the promoter ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) ; ( 2 ) when the RNA SL is localized in the intron , the ﬂ uorescent signal will only account for premature mRNA and should in theory provide a better surrogate of the transcription initiation proc - ess . Unfortunately in this case , the signal will also depend on the ef ﬁ ciency of splicing events and dual - color single - molecule RNA imaging in cultured cells indicated recently that splicing at the same gene might occur stochastically both before and after tran - scription release . 53 Given this stochasticity of splicing ( which could depend on the gene context ) , it will be dif ﬁ cult to easily infer information concerning the promoter characteristics ( bursting or nonbursting behavior , average size and frequency of bursts ) from the ﬂ uorescent signal emerging from such constructs . The signal measured with intronic probes is a convo - lution of the signal coming from transcription initia - tion and stochastic splicing : deconvoluting the signal requires quanti ﬁ cation of the splicing dynamics for each speci ﬁ c intron ; ( 3 ) when the RNA SL is inserted in the 3 0 UTR , the ﬂ uorescent signal is much weaker and thus much more sensitive to the background . As multiple RNAPs are bound to one gene at a given time , the 5 0 positioning of the MS2 cassette leads to a larger number of labeled transcripts that can cumulate along the gene length , leading to a higher intensity of the ﬂ uorescence signal . However , in the 3 0 case , the signal persistence is closer to the activity period of the promoter . USING MODELING TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL POSITION OF THE RNA SLS As noted above , insertions of the RNA SL at different positions have already been engineered to study the hunchback promoter in the very early Drosophila embryo . 22 , 23 The different positioning of the MS2 cassette inspired us to explore how each of the con - structs would impact the reliability of the output signal . Our goal was to assess the advantages and dis - advantages of each of these constructs with regards to the ﬁ delity and precision in measuring the tran - scription process itself . To do this , we modeled a pro - moter cycle ( input ) and compared its theoretical expression state to the calculated ﬂ uorescent signals expected for each construct ( readout ) . Recent single - cell temporal measurements of a short - lived luciferase reporter gene under the control of a promoter in mouse ﬁ broblast cells have quantitatively con ﬁ rmed that transcription initiation in eukaryotes is not well described in terms of just activation and inactivation of the gene . 63 Thus , following previous work , 64 we modeled a promoter cycle that accounts for irreversi - ble transitions between a number of inactive states Advanced Review wires . wiley . com / devbio © 2016 The Authors . WIREsDevelopmentalBiologypublished by Wiley Periodicals , Inc . before the gene can be turned on again ( Figure 6 ) . We then built a theoretical model in which we con - sidered two variants of the SL insertion : one with 24 SL within a 1 . 3 kb cassette at the 3 0 end of the transcribed sequence and another with the same cas - sette placed at the 5 0 end . We calculated ﬂ uorescent time traces for the 3 0 and 5 0 constructs within this model with different values of switching rates between the two possible states of promoter activity : ON ( in which mRNA is produced ) and the OFF states of the promoter . These different values of switching ON / OFF rates of the promoter activity elicit very different bursting beha - viors , with different burst frequencies and burst length ( Figure 6 ( a ) – ( c ) ) . The sensitivity of the read - out on the transcription dynamics depends on the background ( represented as the three dashed lines in Figure 6 corresponding to typical values of the back - ground ﬂ uorescent signal due to unbound ﬂ uorescent CP ) . As in the 3 0 case the whole gene is transcribed before the SL cassette , the time during which SLs accumulate GFP signal ( ‘ buffering time , ’ t buff = length of the transcribed genomic sequence accumulating ﬂ uorescently tagged RNA / polymerase velocity ) is Initiation ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Elongation Splicing Release Promoter activity Signal persistence Signal persistence Promoter Threshold Signal OFF OFF ON Promoter OFF OFF ON OFF Time OFF ON Threshold Signal OFF Time OFF ON Signal persistence Promoter OFF OFF ON Threshold Signal OFF Time OFF ON MS2 M S 2 i n 5 ′ Splicing Release MS2 M S 2 i n 3 ′ Splicing Release MS2 M S 2 i n t he i n t r on Termination FIGURE 5 | The position of the MS2 SLs within the transcribed sequence impact on the signal intensity and its persistence .

This produces a strong ﬂ uorescent signal whose initiation time closely coincides with the initiation time of the burst of transcription . However , since this strong ﬂ uorescent signal will take longer to decay once the promoter is turned OFF , the overall persistence of the signal will be longer than the ON - time period of the promoter ( right panel ) . ( b ) The insertion of the SL tagging sequence inside an intron leads to a longer delay between the onset of the transcription period and signal detection , which depends on the position of the intron relative to the transcription initiation site . Moreover , in this case , the persistence of the signal will also depend on the splicing process . Since splicing takes place during the transcription process or after release , 53 the signal persistence will not properly re ﬂ ect the real activity period of the promoter ( right panel ) . ( c ) When the SL tagging sequence is inserted at a 3 0 position in the transcribed locus , the delay between the onset of the promoter activity period and the detection of the signal will be even longer than in previous cases . The intensity of the signal is also much lower and therefore more sensitive to the signal - to - noise ratio than in the previous cases . However , in this case , because the buffering time is shorter , the persistence of the signal is closer to the activity period of the promoter ( right panel ) .

WIREsDevelopmentalBiologypublished by Wiley Periodicals , Inc . much smaller ( t buff = 52 s ) than with the 5 0 construct ( t buff = 268 s ) , resulting in a much stronger signal for the 5 0 construct . On the one hand , the approximately ﬁ vefold increase of the 5 0 signal makes it insensitive to the background level of unbound ﬂ uorescent CP , whereas the SNR for the 3 0 construct will strongly depend on the unbound ﬂ uorescent CP levels . On the other hand , the strong accumulation of the signal in the 5 0 case hinders the detection of transient OFF events , preventing the direct collection of ON and OFF duration statistics from the time traces ( Figure 6 ) . Qualitatively , if the transitions between the ON ! OFF and OFF ! ON states ( T ON + T OFF ) occur faster than the buffering time of a given con - struct , the ﬂ uorescent signal will not be able to fol - low these transitions . For example , if the kinetics of promoter switching is on the order of 100s for the gene length used in Figure 6 , only the 3 0 construct and not the 5 0 one will show bursting events . In sum - mary , the ﬂ uctuations of the ﬂ uorescent signal from the 3 0 construct are very sensitive to background levels and have low SNR but are closer to the tran - scription dynamics of the promoter for a larger range of frequencies ( k ON and k OFFi ) . The 5 0 construct is much less sensitive to background , but its readout is only closely correlated to the promoter dynamics in a narrower frequency range . AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS The evaluation of ON and OFF switching rates directly from the durations of the ON and OFF ﬂ uo - rescent periods is often not reliable because it requires sampling the OFF times , which strongly depends on the background level . Another option would be to take the derivative of the signal to iden - tify rising and decaying phases . However , this proce - dure further enhances the noise and precludes this approach . Rather than evaluating the switching rates directly from the ON and OFF periods of the ﬂ uores - cent signal , another approach based on the computa - tion of autocorrelation functions ( Figure 7 ) allows for an ef ﬁ cient readout of these two parameters with reduced sensitivity to noise .

Simulations were performed assuming an irreversible promoter cycle ( with three inactive states ) model for transcription activation and deactivation at different frequencies of ON / OFF transitions ( high ( A ) , intermediate ( B ) , and low ( C ) ) . For each case , we show : the change in the state of promoter activity with the distributions of ON ( state 1 ) and OFF ( state 0 ) waiting times as collected at the promoter ( top panel ) , the simulation of the ﬂ uorescent signal detected when the SL tagging sequence is inserted in a 3 ’ ( middle panel ) or 5 ’ ( bottom panel ) position of the transcribed sequence , assuming a SL length of ~ 1 . 3 kb , a transcribed length of 5 . 4 kb , and an occupancy of ~ 0 . 15 kb for one PolII transcribing with a velocity of ~ 25 bp / s 22 . It is assumed that the concentration of PolIIs is not a limiting factor and that they can bind at every moment when the gene is in the ON state . Multiple PolII molecules can constitutively transcribe the gene during one ON event . The horizontal dashed lines in the middle and bottom panels indicate the background levels frequently encountered . The results do not qualitatively depend on the number of inactive states used , and the reversible two state telegraph model 65 gives qualitatively the same results .

WIREsDevelopmentalBiologypublished by Wiley Periodicals , Inc . autocorrelation function of the promoter dynamics follows closely the autocorrelation function of the ﬂ uorescent signal , we can infer the ON and OFF rates of the promoter dynamics from the ﬂ uorescent signal ( readout ) . In these cases , the characteristic decay time of the ﬂ uorescent signal autocorrelation function will be a measure of the relaxation time of the promoter activity , which is explicitly related to the average duration of the ON and OFF states . The ratio between the ON and OFF switching rates can be evaluated from the steady - state value of the gene expression signal , given that the ﬂ uorescent signal can be calibrated . If the measurements are performed in a non - saturated regime , there is a linear relation between the ﬂ uorescence signal and the number of molecules . Calibration of the signal expected from a single RNA SL allows for the conversion of the ﬂ uo - rescence signal into the number of RNA SL and facil - itates learning the ratio of the effective OFF and ON rates from the mean value of the ﬂ uorescence signal . Garcia et al . calibrated the ﬂ uorescence signal in terms of mRNA numbers by comparing the MS2 - MCP ﬂ uorescence spatial pro ﬁ le with the corre - sponding FISH pro ﬁ le 22 exploiting the single - molecule resolution of FISH . 26 As seen from Figure 8 , the autocorrelation function of the ﬂ uorescent signal of the 3 0 construct follows the correlation function of the underlying promoter dynamics more closely than of the 5 0 con - struct ( compare the differences between the black curves and the blue curves in Figure 8 ( a ) with the dif - ferences between the black curves and the red curves in Figure 8 ( b ) ) . In addition , the ability to discriminate between different switching timescales is inversely proportional to the length of the gene ( compare Figure 8 ( b ) with Figure 8 ( c ) ) . For a long gene , the 5 0 construct will accumulate more ﬂ uorescent loops , thus allowing the detection of switching rates only at low frequencies and hereby limiting the dynamic range of the measurement . In the 3 0 case , the difference between the promoter activity and the ﬂ uorescent signal comes from the length of the SL cassette . Shorter cassettes in principle allow for better estimation of the kinetic parameters even in the case of high - frequency switching promoter activity . However a shorter SL cassette also implies a lower ﬂ uorescence signal imposing a very low detec - tion limit . An inherent limitation to the autocorrelation approach is the length of the time window ( from 5 to 15 min ) of the interphases 10 – 13 in the early embryo . The computation of the autocorrelation functions requires statistics ( the variability of the cor - relation function for a given time lag depends on the number of measurements available for this time lag ) and the switching rates are extracted assuming a sta - tionary process . The temporal resolution of the ﬂ uo - rescent signal can be increased by changing the imaging modality , for example using light sheet microscopy or by imaging a lower number of nuclei . However , if the timescale of the relaxation of the promoter dynamics is of the order of the interphase duration ( 5 – 20 min ) , the autocorrelation approach will not work . Yet , if the interphase duration is sig - ni ﬁ cantly longer than the autocorrelation time , using a microscope with greater temporal resolution could permit direct observation of the transcription proc - ess . Lastly , even if the autocorrelation approach is not sensitive to uncorrelated noise such as the tempo - rally uncorrelated noise of the camera or S ( signal ) 1 1 / e t ( time ) τ ( time delay ) Autocorrelation function : Varying τ Averaging on t i S ( t i ) S ( t i + τ ) t i + τ Σ t i ( S ( t i ) – m ) × ( S ( t i + τ ) – m ) t i + τ t i τ τ τ τ relaxation τ S ( t i + τ ) m τ : delay m : mean σ 2 : variance σ σ 2 FIGURE 7 | The autocorrelation function . The autocorrelation function determines the degree of correlation existing in any ﬂ uctuating signal ( mean mand variance σ 2 ) . The signal S ( t ) is multiplied for any time t i with its value at t i + τ , where τ is a delay time . The autocorrelation function at a given time delay is de ﬁ ned as the average of the overlap between the values of the signal taken at two time points at a ﬁ xed delay . This function is used to compare the ﬂ uctuating signal at two different times in order to quantify temporal correlations . The autocorrelation function describes the persistence of the signal ( for example the promoter state ) . This persistence is characterized by the relaxation time of the autocorrelation function , which is the time at which the autocorrelation function of the signal decays by 1 / e , and which represents the average time scale on which the signal has a similar value to its initial value .

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES New methods based on the ﬂ uorescent tagging of RNA in living cells allow for the visualization of ongoing transcription in living organisms . These new methods promise to provide insight into the dynam - ics of the interplay between the transcription factor networks underlying the determination and mainte - nance of cell identity during development . Insights from these new methods are expected at several levels .

The black curves in panels a , b , and c represent the autocorrelation function of the promoter activity simulated as a multi - off state model with seven different conditions ( cartoon ) corresponding to different k ON rate and k OFF rates . The ﬂ uorescent signal was calculated for three different constructs and each of the seven conditions of the promoter cycle model . The autocorrelation functions corresponding to the ﬂ uorescent signal ( readout , color ) were compared to the autocorrelation of the promoter state ( input , black ) . The SL sequence for ﬂ uorescent tagging of the RNA was inserted in the 3 0 end of a 5 kb - long transcribed sequence ( a , blue ) , in the 5 0 end of a 5 kb - long transcribed sequence ( b , red ) or in the 5 0 end of a 10 kb - long transcribed sequence ( c , pink ) . When the SL tagging sequence is inserted in the 3 0 end of the transcribed sequence , the autocorrelation of the promoter cycle and the calculated ﬂ uorescent signal are almost superimposed . The similarity is weaker when the SL tagging sequence is inserted in the 5 0 end and the difference increases with the length of the transcribed sequence .

Notably , bursting has been directly observed for the even - skipped promoter , 39 the polymerase velocity has been directly measured using two reporters with MS2 SL cassette insertions at different positions within the transcribed sequence 22 and the Bicoid transcription factor has been shown to lengthen the activity periods of the hunchback promoter . 23 Second , by providing tempo - ral information about gene expression in each single cell in the context of the whole organism , these new methods will allow for the collective analysis of these developmental processes and will shed light on their robustness . Finally , besides determining the role of transcription factor networks in development , these approaches should also help to analyze how transcrip - tional memory and chromatin dynamics contribute throughout cell divisions to these processes . Movies describing the temporal dynamics of the transcription state of a given locus in each nucleus of the living embryo generate a huge amount of data that requires analysis at different scales in space and in time . The core methods are now availa - ble but clearly using them to provide a quantitative understanding of development will require contribu - tions from biologists to generate the material to be analyzed , biophysicists to provide input into the new imaging technologies and theoreticians for data anal - ysis and modeling .
