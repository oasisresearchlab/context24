Modelling host behavioral change in response to epidemics is important to describe disease dynamics and many previous studies proposed mathematical models describing it . Indeed , the epidemic of COVID - 19 clearly demonstrated that people changed their activity in response to the epidemic , which subsequently modified the disease dynamics . To predict the behavioral change relevant to the disease dynamics , we need to know the epidemic situation ( e . g . , the number of reported cases ) at the moment of decision to change behavior . However , it is difficult to identify the timing of decision - making . In this study , we analyzed travel accommodation reservation data in four prefectures of Japan to observe decision - making timings and how it responded to the changing epidemic situation during Japan‚Äôs Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( eight waves until February 2023 ) . To this end , we defined " mobility avoidance index " to indicate people ' s decision of mobility avoidance and quantified it using the time - series of the accommodation booking / cancellation data . Our analysis revealed semi - quantitative rules for day - to - day decision - making of human mobility under a given epidemic situation . We observed matches of the peak dates of the index and the number of reported cases . Additionally , we found that mobility avoidance index increased / decreased linearly with the logarithmic number of reported cases during the first epidemic wave . This pattern agrees with Weber ‚Äì Fechner law in psychophysics . We also found that the slope of the mobility avoidance index against the change of the logarithmic number of reported cases were similar among the waves , while the intercept of that was much reduced as the first epidemic wave passed by . It suggests that the people ' s response became weakened after the first experience , as if the number of reported cases were multiplied by a constant small factor . 3 Introduction The world has faced an unprecedented disaster‚ÄîCoronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) ‚Äî resulting from infection by a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome ‚Äì related coronavirus ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , and suffered heavy losses in terms of human lives and economy . Controlling emerging infectious disease epidemics is urgently required , for which , predicting their future course is mandatory . Mathematical modelling is expected to explain the long - term behavior of epidemic dynamics , but long - term forecasting of infectious disease epidemics is challenging using any method ( 1 - 3 ) . A factor which causes prediction errors is host behavioral change . Non - pharmaceutical interventions conducted during the COVID - 19 outbreak , resulted in reduced human mobility ( 4 - 8 ) . In addition to interventions , human mobility changes voluntarily depend on the epidemic situation ( 9 , 10 ) . To complicate matters , mandatory or voluntary behavioral responses for preventing the disease‚Äôs spread could change with time ( 11 ) because of adapting to the interventions or outbreaks ( 12 , 13 ) , tiredness due to prolonged situations ( 14 , 15 ) , or habituation for the spread of diseases ( 16 , 17 ) . These facts indicate that epidemic situations change human mobility , which in turn , simultaneously affect epidemic dynamics . To understand such bidirectional interactions , we need to simultaneously model epidemic and human mobility change dynamics . The mathematical model of disease dynamics considers human decision - making for future behavior in response to epidemic situations , which keep changing . Modelling human behavior changes in response to an epidemic situation requires patterns of human decision - making for future behavior against epidemics . Mathematical models study epidemic dynamics with human behavioral change , considering that humans change their behaviors by cost - benefit analysis for themselves ( 18 , 19 ) and behavioral changes of others ( 20 - 23 ) . Human behaviors can be changed by various factors such as increments in reported cases of infection , fear , or interventions . Prediction of epidemic situations requires information about the drivers of human behavioral changes in response to epidemic situations , but such information is still lacking . A reason for this lack of information is the difficulty in observing the decision - making process . The human mobility changes in response to COVID - 19 are being studied using records of actually performed ( 24 - 35 ) human mobility ( e . g . data extracted from mobile phones ( 26 - 30 ) or smart cards ) ( 31 - 33 ) . However , performed human mobility can be considered the cumulative result of human responses against past epidemics , because humans often make decisions regarding future behaviors depending on the current situation . Therefore , detecting decision timings for mobility changes or comparisons between mobility change and epidemic situations from records of performed human mobility are difficult . 4 To observe the decision - making process , Ito et al . 2022 focused on reservation data , which records the individual - level decision - making process of mobility changes , such as the timing of making reservations or cancellations ( 36 ) . Reservation data usage enables to know the epidemic situations at the timings of decision for mobility changes , which is essential for constructing a mechanistic model to predict human mobility responses to epidemics . Ito et al . proposed a method for quantifying the human decision - making process for future behaviors against epidemics ( viz . a human mobility avoidance index from an accommodation reservation dataset ) ( 36 ) . Comparing this estimated index with the epidemic status will reveal the drivers for human behavioral response against epidemics , which contributes to constructing a disease dynamics mathematical model , considering human decision - making for future behaviors in response to epidemic situations , which keep changing . In this study , we measured the human mobility avoidance index using the largest dataset of accommodation reservation data in Japan which covers half of the existed accommodations , and compared it with the number of reported COVID - 19 cases , to analyze how humans decide their mobility during changing epidemic situations . Results We estimated a mobility avoidance index in response to epidemic conditions at week t for the mobility x days ahead , ùúÜ # ! , # ; ùúÜ # = 0 means which is equal to the average mobility avoidance level before the emergence of COVID - 19 and ùúÜ # = 1 means no new mobility planned and cancelling all planned mobilities . The estimated mobility avoidance index ùúÜ # from accommodation reservations varied in response to the epidemic ( Figs . 1A and 1B ) . Before the sixth epidemic wave ( red in Fig . 1C ) , ùúÜ # increased / decreased with the increase / decrease in the number of reported COVID - 19 cases , and timings of local maxima and minima of ùúÜ # over calendar time were close to those of the number of reported cases , except during the second wave ( cyan in Fig . 1C ) . The mobility avoidance indices for the near future ( 86 days later ) returned to normal after the sixth wave ; average mobility avoidance level after the sixth wave was 0 , which is the average mobility avoidance level before / during the emergence of COVID - 19 ( Fig . S1 ) . Contrarily , the long term ( more than 86 days later ) mobility avoidance indices did not return to normal until mostly the end of the eighth wave ( Figs . 1A and 1C ) . The increased / decreased rates of the logarithm of the number of reported cases of COVID - 19 showed a linear relationship with those of ùúÜ # ( Fig . 2A ) . Compared with the previous week , the difference in ùúÜ # was proportional to the difference in the logarithm of the number of reported cases ( e . g . Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient between the differences of ùúÜ # ! , $ % and the number of reported 5 cases compared with the last week was 0 . 55 ) . This indicates that ùúÜ # has a linear relationship with the logarithm of the number of reported cases . However , Fig . 1C shows that the amplitude of the oscillation of ùúÜ # is not simply correlated with the number of reported cases ( i . e . the reported cases of COVID - 19 were increasing over calendar time while ùúÜ # was decreasing ) . This implies that the linear relationship between the number of reported cases and ùúÜ # has varied over waves . Using the k - means clustering algorithm , we clustered the relationship between the amounts of increase / decrease in ùúÜ # and the logarithm of the number of reported cases into three clusters , regardless of how many days ahead the predictions were ( Figs . 2B - E ) : the first wave strongly affected human mobility as an encounter with an unknown disease , second to fifth ( sixth for only ùúÜ # ! , & ‚Äô % ) waves as adaptation to the disease , and other waves as human mobility returning to normal . Based on the linear relationship between ùúÜ # and the logarithm of the number of reported cases , a linear model of ùúÜ # ! , # ; ùúÜ # ! , # = ùëé ( log ( [ the number of reported cases ] ) ‚àí ùëè ) , ( 1 ) was fitted to the data of ùúÜ # ! , # and the number of reported cases for each wave , by the least squares method . The slope of linear model a was similar among the waves except for the ‚Äòback to normal‚Äô cluster , while the horizontal intercept b shifted after the first epidemic wave ( Fig . 3 ) . The coefficient of determination values show that the linear relation of ùúÜ # ! , # with the number of reported cases was strong until the fifth wave , except in the second wave , and it becomes weak after the sixth wave ( Table 1 ) . The linear relation of ùúÜ # ! , # with the number of reported cases also becomes weaker long - term ( future ) . The long - term mobility avoidance indices showed a smaller slope ( i . e . the response against the number of reported cases became weaker ; Fig . S2 ) . Discussion We analyzed accommodation reservation big data in an online travel agency in Japan to understand the dynamics of human mobility changes in response to COVID - 19 . We applied the method of measuring future decision - making of human mobility avoidance from an accommodation reservation dataset . The comparison of the estimated human mobility avoidance and epidemic situations revealed a simple rule for human mobility changes in response to epidemics : humans decide their mobility based on changes in the logarithm of number of reported 6 cases . The sensitivity of decision - making of human mobility to an epidemic ( a in equation ( 1 ) ) was determined in the first wave , and transferred to later waves . Conversely , the people ' s response against the number of reported cases became weakened during the second wave , as if the number of reported cases were multiplied by a constant small factor ( increase of b in equation ( 1 ) ) , and transferred to later waves . These patterns , that we found , are the first quantitative reports of how humans make decisions regarding mobility avoidance in response to infectious diseases . We found that humans decide their mobility based on changes in the logarithm of number of reported cases . This trend agrees with Weber ‚Äì Fechner‚Äôs law ( 37 ) : the intensity of the sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus . Additionally , the difference of ùúÜ # compared to previous week is proportional to the difference in the logarithm of the number of reported cases compared to previous week . The difference in the logarithm of the number of reported cases compared with the previous week was equivalent to the effective reproduction number minus one , suggesting that humans measure the intensity of epidemic situations by the effective reproduction number , and not infection risks at individual levels ( i . e . quantity relative to the number of cases ) . We also found that the people ' s response against the number of reported cases became weakened after the first epidemic wave , while sensitivity against the epidemic ( a in equation ( 1 ) ) was determined in the first wave , and transferred to the later waves . From equation ( 1 ) , the increment of horizontal intercept Œî b is equivalent with the scaling the number of reported cases by a constant small factor exp [ - Œî b ] : ùúÜ # ! , # = ùëé > log ( [ the number of reported cases ] ) ‚àí ( ùëè + Œîùëè ) A = ùëé ( log ( exp [ ‚àíŒîùëè ] [ the number of reported cases ] ) ‚àí ùëè ) . ( 2 ) This scaling the number of reported cases recognises weaker mobility avoidance , which can be regarded as the result of habituation to COVID - 19 waves . The horizontal intercept b in the end of the second wave was similar among the third , fourth and fifth waves , the habituation occurred strongly after the first experience but it was not accumulated as the subsequent waves passed . Such trends could be explained by a psychological heuristic , the peak - end rule ( 38 ) ; memorisation of a past event depends on how humans feel at the most intense timing , and its end . The strongest experience about the number of reported cases was memorized during the first epidemic wave , and the habituation for the number of reported cases occurred during the second waves . 7 These findings on human decision - making for mobility avoidance have important implications for controlling emerging infectious diseases . For example , the peak - end rule suggests , that once the community experiences a large outbreak , its members might show no response to the infection‚Äôs spread thereafter , owing to the scaled number of reported cases by habituation . This implies that the prevention of huge peaks like ‚Äòthe hammer and the dance‚Äô is important not only in the realm of healthcare services , but also for preventing habituation to the number of reported cases . This also suggests , that once a community experiences large peaks in the number of infections , it may become very difficult to recognise small outbreaks . After the sixth wave , the mobility avoidance level was back to normal for three months , but not for longer than three months . This result agrees with Ito et al . ( 36 ) ( viz . decision - making for only short - term future behaviors are associated with changes in epidemic situations ) . This result suggests that after the sixth wave in Japan ended , the Japanese felt that the abnormal situation owing to COVID - 19 would end in the near future . Ever since the sixth wave , the dominant strain in Japan ( 39 ) changed from Delta to Omicron variants whose natural history comprised higher transmissibility but lower severity ( 40 , 41 ) , leading the Japanese to judge it as the end of the abnormal situation . The mathematical model of human mobility changes in response to epidemics , based on our finding , showed that as humans decide their mobility by changes in the logarithm of the number of reported cases , data fits well only for short - term future behaviors ( e . g . before the sixth wave‚Äôs decrease phase ; Table 1 ) . As short - term future mobility avoidance returned to normal after the sixth wave , despite the large number of reported cases ( Fig . 1C ) , the model of human behavior changes is applicable only when humans react to changes in an epidemic situation . Moreover , as long - term future mobility avoidance also showed a low response to changes in epidemic situations , predictions based on the number of reported cases seem difficult . Constant mobility avoidance might have been instrumental for the low human mobility change responses to changes in the epidemic situation . The analysis of accommodation reservation data revealed , that human mobility changes were determined by the logarithm of the number of reported cases . While sensitivity of human mobility avoidance to the epidemic situation was established in the first wave , it did not change in later waves . Additionally , people scaled the number of reported cases for their decision of mobility avoidance by a constant factor after the end of second wave , did not change in later waves . These responses can be explained by psychology and psychophysics laws , applicable to human behavioral responses against a wide range of infectious disease epidemics . The application of such laws can help in understanding forecasts on future epidemics . 8 Methods Estimation of mobility avoidance level from reservation data We analyzed the accommodation reservation dataset to estimate human mobility changes , as proposed by Ito et al . ( 36 ) . Accommodation reservation data records decision - making for mobility based on making new reservations for planning new mobility , and cancellations of planned trips . We assumed that a mobility avoidance index in response to epidemic conditions at week t , for mobility x days ahead , Œª t , x existed , and humans decide to plan a new mobility or cancel a planned mobility depending on Œª t , x . We modelled the relationship between Œª t , x and change rates of reservations / cancellations as an extension of Richard ' s model ( 42 ) assuming a monotonic decrease / increase of reservations / cancellations by the increase of Œª t , x . The reduction rate for new mobility ( reservations ) for x days ahead is planned in week t by Œª t , x , R t , x , and is modelled as ùëÖ ! , # = & & ( ) # * + , + - . / 0 ! + 1 ! , # 2342 2 , ( 3 ) and the increase rate of cancellations of existing mobility for x days ahead at time t by Œª t , x , C t , x is modelled as ùê∂ ! , # = & & ( ) # * + 6 + - . / 0 ! + 1 ! , # 2372 2 , ( 4 ) where ùëôùëúùëîùëñùë° ( ùúÜ ) = ùëôùëõ K 1 & 31 L . ( 5 ) We constructed Œª t , x , so that 0 refers to a score which is equal to the average mobility avoidance level before the emergence of COVID - 19 , and 1 means that no new mobility is planned and all planned mobilities are cancelled . The expected number of reservations for stay x days ahead , at time t , which is reduced by Œª t , x is ùëÖ ! , # ‚àó = ùëÖM # > 1 ‚àí ùëÖ ! , # A ( 6 ) where ùëÖM # is the average number of new reservations for stay , x days ahead of the stay , before COVID - 19‚Äôs emergence . Similarly , the cancellation probability of existing reservations per day is represented as ùê∂ ! , # , 9 ‚àó = ùê∂ÃÖ # , 9 + > 1 ‚àí ùê∂ÃÖ # , 9 Aùê∂ ! , # ( 7 ) where ùê∂ÃÖ # , 9 is the average cancellation probability of the reservation , which is reserved ùë¶ days ahead of the stay , and cancelled x days ahead of the stay , before the emergence of COVID - 19 . Œª t , x , a , b , c , and d were estimated from the accommodation reservation dataset . 9 The accommodation reservation dataset records the number of new reservations in week t for stay x days ahead , and the observed number of cancellations ùë• days ahead of the stay , at week ùë° , which was the reservation ùë¶ days ahead of the stay . We constructed the likelihood function for Œª t , x , a , b , c , d , L as follows : ùêø > ùëé , ùëè , ùëê , ùëë , ùúÜ ! , # A = ‚àè ‚àè ùëùùëöùëì > ùëùùëúùëñùë†ùë†ùëúùëõ > ùëÖ ! , # ‚àó A , ùëÖ ! , # , : , ! , A # ! √ó ‚àè ‚àè ‚àè ùëùùëöùëì > ùêµùëñùëõ > ùê∂ ! , # , 9 ‚àó , ùëÅ ! , # , 9 , : , ! , A , ùëÄ ! , # , 9 , : , ! , A 9 # ! , ( 8 ) where ùëÖ ! , # , : , ! , is the observed number of accommodation reservations for the stay ùë• days ahead at week ùë° . ùëÅ ! , # , 9 , : , ! , is the observed number of surviving reservations on ùë• days ahead of the stay at week ùë° , which was the reservation ùë¶ days ahead of the stay . ùëÄ ! , # , 9 , : , ! , is the observed number of cancellations ùë• days ahead of the stay at week ùë° , which was the reservation ùë¶ days ahead of the stay ; ùëùùëöùëì ( ùëùùëúùëñùë†ùë†ùëñùëúùëõ ( ùê∏ ) , ùë• ) and ùëùùëöùëì ( ùêµùëñùëõ ( ùëõ , ùëù ) , ùë• ) denote the probability mass function of the Poisson and binomial distributions , when the expected number of observed events is ùê∏ , the trial number is ùëõ , the probability that an event occurs is ùëù , and the number of observed events is ùë• . Œª t , x , a , b , c , and d were estimated maximizing L . The maximum likelihood estimate of ùúÜ ! , # , ùúÜ ! , # ‚àó , was normalised by the average ùúÜ ! , # before the emergence of COVID - 19 , ùúÜÃÖ ! , # , such that , 0 is equal to the average ùúÜ ! , # before the emergence of COVID - 19 , and 1 is the theoretical maximum value of ùúÜ ! , # as ùúÜ # ! , # = 1 ! , # ‚àó 31 ; # & 31 ; # . ( 9 ) The normalised ùúÜ ! , # , ùúÜ # ! , # was smoothed by the locally weighted smoothing method along both week t and ùë• days direction . Data We obtained an anonymized online accommodation reservation dataset from a travel agency ( https : / / www . jalan . net / ) . To compare human mobility before and after COVID - 19 , we used reservation and cancellation data from 28 December 2015 to 19 February 2023 for accommodations located in Miyagi , Aichi , Osaka , and Fukuoka prefectures . These prefectures are the most populous among the prefectures in each region of Japan . Data from these prefectures were used to avoid the geographical heterogeneity of human mobility . The number of accommodations located in four prefectures ( Miyagi , Aichi , Osaka and Fukuoka ) provided by jalan . net are 321 , 559 , 681 and 585 ( counted on ‚Äújalan . net‚Äù website on 24th April 2023 ) , which covers 45 . 1 % , 58 . 4 % , 43 . 8 % , and 54 . 7 % of the accommodations reported by Japan Tourism Agency ( 43 ) . We obtained the number of reported COVID - 19 cases from the website of the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare of Japan ( 44 ) , and defined each epidemic wave‚Äôs duration in terms of the number of reported cases , as shown in Table S1 . 10 Acknowledgments This research was supported by JST , CREST [ grant number JPMJCR20H1 ] and JSPS , Grant - in - Aid for Scientific Research ( B ) [ grant number 22H03345 ] .
