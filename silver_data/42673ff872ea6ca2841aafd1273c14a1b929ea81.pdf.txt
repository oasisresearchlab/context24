Role of Endosomes in Simian Virus 40 Entry and Infection (cid:1) † Sabrina Engel , 1 Thomas Heger , 1 Roberta Mancini , 1 Fabian Herzog , 1 ‡ Ju¨rgen Kartenbeck , 2 Arnold Hayer , 1 § and Ari Helenius 1 * ETH Zurich , Institute of Biochemistry , Schafmattstrasse 18 , 8093 Zurich , Switzerland , 1 and German Cancer Research Center ( DKFZ ) , M010 and W200 Core Facility Microscopy , Im Neuenheimer Feld 280 , 69120 Heidelberg , Germany 2 Received 15 October 2010 / Accepted 11 February 2011 After binding to its cell surface receptor ganglioside GM1 , simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) is endocytosed by lipid raft - mediated endocytosis and slowly transported to the endoplasmic reticulum , where partial uncoating occurs . We analyzed the intracellular pathway taken by the virus in HeLa and CV - 1 cells by using a targeted small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) silencing screen , electron microscopy , and live - cell imaging as well as by testing a variety of cellular inhibitors and other perturbants . We found that the virus entered early endosomes , late endosomes , and probably endolysosomes before reaching the endoplasmic reticulum and that this pathway was part of the infectious route . The virus was especially sensitive to a variety of perturbations that inhibited endosome acidiﬁcation and maturation . Contrary to our previous models , which postulated the passage of the virus through caveolin - rich organelles that we called caveosomes , we conclude that SV40 depends on the classical endocytic pathway for infectious entry . To enter their host cells , the majority of animal viruses take advantage of endocytic mechanisms offered by the cell ( 23 , 39 ) . Penetration into the cytosol usually occurs from endosomes , often triggered by the low lumenal pH . However , there are viruses that deviate from this standard itinerary . These viruses include members of the polyomavirus family , such as mouse polyomavirus ( mPy ) and simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) . These viruses are nonenveloped DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus . The interest and importance of this virus family are rapidly growing with the increasing number of human polyomavi - ruses identiﬁed . The most recently discovered human patho - gens include KI polyomavirus ( KIPyV ) , WU polyomavirus ( WUPyV ) , and Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCPyV ) ( 1 , 17 , 20 ) . MCPyV is associated with the aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer Merkel cell carcinoma . Most polyomaviruses bind to gangliosides on the cell surface and are internalized into small tight - ﬁtting vesicles devoid of a clathrin coat ( 26 , 28 , 30 , 34 , 55 , 59 ) . Instead of using endo - somes for penetration , they travel to the lumen of the endo - plasmic reticulum ( ER ) , in which they are activated by lumenal thiol oxidoreductases and chaperones before penetrating into the cytosol or possibly directly into the nucleoplasm ( 28 , 37 , 46 , 53 ) . In this study , we focus on SV40 , a virus that binds to GM1 and is internalized via caveola / lipid raft - dependent endocytic mechanisms ( 2 , 11 , 45 , 57 , 59 ) . Some virus particles are endo - cytosed via caveolae , and others enter through a parallel clath - rin - and caveolin - independent mechanism . Uptake is slow and nonsynchronous , with transfer into the ER and penetration through the ER membrane occurring several hours after the initial endocytosis ( 53 ) . Exactly where SV40 spends the intervening hours is not clear . Unlike ER - targeted bacterial toxins such as cholera toxin and Shiga toxin , the virus particles are not observed in the trans - Golgi network or the cisternae of the Golgi complex . Some of them are seen in early endosomes ( EEs ) by confocal and electron microscopy ( 28 , 42 ) . We also reported the accu - mulation of incoming SV40 particles in so - called “caveo - somes , ” which we deﬁned as large caveolin - 1 - positive , pH - neutral , endocytic organelles devoid of transferrin and other EE markers ( 44 ) . Our observation of viruses in these organ - elles led us to propose a model whereby the caveosomal route allows incoming SV40 to bypass the classical endosomes during its transit from the plasma membrane to the ER ( 44 ) . How - ever , our most recent results indicate that caveosomes are not independent organelles but rather modiﬁed late endosomes ( LEs ) or endolysosomes in which caveolin - 1 accumulates after overexpression or after interference with caveolar assembly ( 25 ) . In the light of these ﬁndings , the intracellular trafﬁcking pathway followed by SV40 needs reevaluation . To analyze the transport of incoming viruses and the pathway to infection , in this study we have used a variety of techniques that allowed the visualization , tracking , and localization of viruses at different stages of entry into cells in which caveolar assembly was not interfered with . The experiments involved video microscopy of live cells , electron microscopy ( EM ) , and a variety of pertur - bants in the form of small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) and pharmacological inhibitors . To avoid ﬁxation artifacts that af - fect the visualization of late endosomes ( 25 ) , many of the experiments were performed with live cells . The results pro - vided a detailed picture of the intracellular route followed by the infectious virus and led to a thorough revision of our previous model of SV40 entry . * Corresponding author .

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . SV40 puriﬁcation . The protocol for virus puriﬁcation was based on those described previously ( 10 , 15 ) . In brief , monkey kidney CV - 1 cells were cultured in complete medium ( DMEM [ Gibco ] supplemented with 10 % FCS [ LabForce , Nunningen , Switzerland ] and 4 mM GlutaMAX ) at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Forty T175 ﬂasks of subconﬂuent CV - 1 cells were infected with SV40 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0 . 01 in DMEM without additives . Cells were cultured in complete medium for 14 days . To harvest virus , cells were put through three freeze - thaw cycles and then centrifuged at 10 , 000 (cid:1) g for 10 min at 4°C . Twenty milliliters of virus - containing supernatant was loaded onto a 10 - ml cushion of CsCl ( 1 . 4 g ml (cid:2) 1 ) in 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Following centrifugation at 76 , 000 (cid:1) g for 3 h at 4°C in anSW28 rotor ( Beckman ) , the banded virus in the CsCl cushion was harvested . The density of the CsCl fraction containing SV40 was checked , and the fraction was adjusted to a CsCl density of 1 . 34 g / ml in 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Following equilibrium centrifugation at 100 , 000 (cid:1) g for 16 h at 4°C in a 70 . 1 Ti rotor ( Beckman ) , the lower virus band was isolated and dialyzed against a solution containing 50 mM HEPES ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 mM CaCl 2 ( virus buffer ) . The puriﬁed infectious virus was stored in aliquots at (cid:2) 80°C . Fluorescent labeling of SV40 . The ﬂuorescent labeling procedure was done as described previously ( 44 ) . The modiﬁed SV40 virions were able to bind , enter , and infect CV - 1 cells as described previously ( 44 ) . SV40 infection . CV - 1 cells in 6 - or 12 - well plates were infected with SV40 in inoculation medium ( R - medium [ Gibco ] containing 50 mM HEPES buffer [ In - vitrogen ] and 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ; Fluka ] [ pH 6 . 8 ] ) at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 for 2 h at an MOI of 1 , resulting in 20 to 30 % infection , or at an MOI of 5 , resulting in 30 to 50 % infection . Subsequently , cells were washed with phos - phate - buffered saline ( PBS ; pH 7 . 4 ) and maintained in DMEM with 10 % FCS at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 for an additional 22 h until they were ﬁxed with 4 % formalde - hyde in PBS for 20 min . Cells were permeabilized , labeled for SV40 T - antigen expression , and subjected to ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorter ( FACS ) analysis . For experiments with pharmacological inhibitors , cells were incubated with the respective drug ( sample ) or solvent alone ( control sample ) an hour before the addition of the virus and during infection . Drugs were used at the following concentrations : 0 . 2 mM genistein in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ( Calbiochem ) , 5 (cid:3) M nocodazole in DMSO ( Sigma ) , 100 mM orthovanadate ( OV ) in H 2 O ( Sigma ) , 0 . 5 (cid:3) g / ml brefeldin A ( BFA ) in DMSO ( Sigma ) , 80 (cid:3) M dynasore in DMSO ( Sigma ) , 100 nM baﬁlomycin A 1 ( Baf ) in DMSO ( Fluka ) , 10 (cid:3) M monen - sin in H 2 O ( Sigma ) , 20 mM NH 4 Cl in H 2 O ( Sigma ) , and 100 nM okadaic acid ( OA ) in DMSO ( Sigma ) . Culture medium ( pH 7 . 4 ) was additionally buffered with 50 mM HEPES when NH 4 Cl was used ( 29 ) . FACS analysis . For FACS analysis , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS , permeabilized ( 0 . 1 % [ wt / vol ] saponin , 2 % FCS , 20 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02 % NaN 3 in PBS ) , and stained with primary antibodies fo r 2 h atroom temperature ( RT ) ( mouse anti - T antigen [ 1 : 100 ] ) , followed by Alexa Fluor 647 - labeled goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen ) for 45 min at RT . Cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur cytometer using CellQuest 3 . 1 software ( Becton Dickinson Im - munocytometry Systems ) . At least 10 , 000 cells were analyzed for each sample . Transfection , subcellular localization , immunostaining , and microscopy . For localization studies , CV - 1 cells were transiently transfected with 2 (cid:3) g plasmid DNA encoding ﬂuorescently tagged versions of the proteins using the Amaxa electroporation system and plated into 12 - well dishes with coverslips or 8 - well glass - bottom chambers . After 12 h in culture , ﬂuorescently labeled SV40 ( MOI of (cid:4) 10 ) was added to cells fo r 1 h onice , unbound virus was washed away , and the cells expressing small amounts of the XFP - tagged fusion proteins were imaged live at 37°C at different time points postwarming with an inverted Zeiss 200 M spinning - disc microscope , an argon / krypton and helium / neon laser , a Hamamatsu C9100 - 13 electron - multiplying charge - coupled - device ( EM - CCD ) camera with a 100 (cid:1) 1 . 47 - numerical - aperture ( NA ) objective , and a tem - perature - controlled incubation chamber using Metamorph ( Molecular Devices ) or with an inverted Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope ( model 510Meta ; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) equipped with a heating device , a 100 (cid:1) Zeiss apochromat objective ( 1 . 4 NA ) , and an argon laser ( 458 , 477 , 488 , and 514 nm ) at 30 mW , an HeNe laser ( 543 nm ) at 1 mW , or an HeNe laser ( 633 nm ) at 5 mW . For loading the cells with AF488 - dextran , CV - 1 cells were plated into 8 - well glass - bottom chambers . After 12 h in culture , AF488 - dextran ( catalog number D - 22910 ; Invitrogen ) was added fo r 4 h at37°C . The cells were washed and incubated for a further 20 h at 37°C before ﬂuorescently labeled SV40 - AF647 ( MOI of (cid:4) 10 ) was added to the cells fo r 1 h onice . Unbound virus was washed away , and cells were incubated for another 4 h before being imaged live at 37°C with the microscope settings described above . For immunoﬂuorescence detection of cellular proteins after incubation with ﬂuorescent virus , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % formaldehyde solution in PBS and either permeabilized in PBS containing 3 % BSA ( wt / vol ) and 0 . 05 % ( wt / vol ) Triton X - 100 ( TX - 100 ) for staining with anti - EEA1 ( 1 : 500 ) or permeabilized with PBS containing 0 . 1 % ( wt / vol ) saponin and 3 % BSA for staining with anti - LAMP1 ( 1 : 200 ) antibody , followed by secondary antibodies coupled to AF488 , AF594 , or AF647 ( Invitrogen ) . Samples were mounted using ImmuMount ( Thermo Shandon ) , and imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope system . Images were processed by using Image J ( National Institutes of Health ) or Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe Systems ) . Quantiﬁcation of colocalization in ﬁxed and live cells . Quantiﬁcation of the colocalization of the virus in live CV - 1 cells expressing XFP - tagged constructs was performed by taking single confocal slices with an inverted Zeiss 200 M spinning - disc microscope ( described above ) at the indicated time points and analyzing the images with a MATLAB - based colocalization program ( Peter Horvath , Light Microscopy Center , ETH Zurich ) . The program considered a virus to colocalize with a given marker if at least 50 % of the virus overlapped with the marker and if the marker signal exhibited a clear local maximum below the virus at the same time . Quantiﬁcation of the colocalization of the virus with LAMP1 and EEA1 in ﬁxed cells was done by using images taken with the CellR wide - ﬁeld microscope system equipped with an inverted Olympus IX80 micro - scope using a 100 (cid:1) 1 . 47 - NA oil UplanSApo objective . Samples were illuminated with a xenon lamp ( MT20 CellR unit ) and recorded with a Hamamatsu Orca ER camera . Five z stacks were taken for each cell , and the intensity was projected and analyzed with the MATLAB - based colocalization program . All samples within one experiment were acquired with the same microscope settings using Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices ) , the LSM 510 software package ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) , or the CellR software version from the manufacturer . Internalization assay . SV40 - AF488 ( MOI of (cid:4) 10 ) was added to CV - 1 cells , transfected with Rab7 - monomeric RFP ( mRFP ) to visualize the cell boundaries , on ice for 1 h . Subsequently , cells were warmed to 37°C in the presence of 5 % CO 2 . The ﬂuorescent signal of the dye was recorded at 4 h postwarming for live cells at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 with a Zeiss 200 M spinning - disc confocal microscope equipped with a highly sensitive Hamamatsu C9100 - 13 EM - CCD camera . For the control samples , images were taken at room temperature 10 min after incubation on ice . A z stack , with each slice being 0 . 5 (cid:3) m in thickness , of at least ﬁve cells was taken . The addition of trypan blue ( 0 . 4 % [ wt / vol ] ; Invitrogen ) at a dilution of 1 : 50 immediately shifted the emission spectrum of particles exposed on the cell surface and led to a loss of detectable ﬂuorescence in the 505 - to 530 - nm channel . Fluorescence images were exported as 12 - bit tagged image ﬁle format ( TIFF ) ﬁles and merged , and the maximum intensity was projected with Image J ( NIH ) and quantiﬁed with a custom - written colocalization program implemented in MATLAB ( Peter Horvath , Light Microscopy Center , ETH Zurich ) . Electron microscopy . For thin - section EM , CV - 1 cells plated onto 12 - mm coverslips were incubated with 100 nM Baf or 5 (cid:3) M nocodazole or in the absence of drugs and with SV40 ( MOI of 200 ) in R - medium at 37°C for 2 or 4 h before ﬁxation with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( with 0 . 05 M sodium cacodylate [ pH 7 . 2 ] , 50 mM KCl , 1 . 25 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 . 25 mM CaCl 2 ) for 60 min at RT , followed by 1 . 5 h of incubation in 2 % OsO 4 on ice . Dehydration , embedding , and thin sectioning were performed as previously described ( 28 ) . For negative staining , V OL . 85 , 2011 SV40 ENTERS ENDOSOMES 4199 on N o v e m be r 13 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m 0 . 4 - (cid:3) m mesh copper grids were coated with a 4 - nm carbon ﬁlm . A 10 - (cid:3) l sample containing 0 . 5 mg / ml SV40 was added for 30 s , drained of excess liquid , and stained for an additional 30 s with 2 % uranyl acetate in distilled water . After transmission electron microscopy ( Zeiss EM 91 microscope ) , images were ex - ported as 8 - bit TIFF ﬁles . RNAi screen . An RNA interference ( RNAi ) screen of SV40 infection was performed with siRNAs against 108 selected genes encoding proteins that play a role in clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis , signaling , endocytic membrane trafﬁcking , as well as cytoskeletal organization . HeLa cells were transfected in 96 - well black optical - bottom plates ( Nunc ) independently with three nonoverlapping targeting siRNAs per gene ( Qiagen ) ( see Table S1 in the supplemental material ) , with each siRNA in duplicate and in two independent experiments . To monitor transfection efﬁciency , an siRNA causing cell death ( Hs _ KIF11 _ 6 ; Qiagen ) was used in each plate ( 66 ) . AllStarsNegative siRNA was added as a nontargeting control in quadruplets per plate . To avoid inhomogeneous cell distribution in the outermost wells , only the inner 60 wells of a 96 - well plate were used , while the outermost 36 wells were ﬁlled with medium . Transfection was performed according to a reverse transfection protocol . Brieﬂy , siRNA ( 20 nM ﬁnal concentration ) and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( ﬁnal dilution , 1 : 1 , 000 ; Invitrogen ) were prediluted in Opti - MEM ( Invitrogen ) , spotted onto 96 - well plates , and incubated for at least 10 min at RT to allow siRNA - lipid complex formation . A total of 1 , 300 HeLa cells per well in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS and GlutaMAX ( Invitrogen ) were added to the lipid - siRNA complex and incubated for 72 h at 37°C . Plates that showed an uneven cell distribution or insufﬁcient cell death in AllStarsDeath positive - control wells were discarded . Cells were washed once with PBS and inoculated with SV40 suspension in R - medium ( RPMI medium , pH 6 . 8 ) at an MOI resulting in 10 to 30 % infected cells for 120 min at 37°C . The virus inoculum was replaced by full medium ( DMEM ) , and the cells were incubated for an additional 22 h at 37°C . After ﬁxation with formaldehyde ( 4 % ﬁnal concentration ) , the cells were washed , permeabilized ( PERM buffer [ 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 3 % BSA , PBS ] ﬁltered through a 0 . 4 - (cid:3) m membrane to remove ﬁbers ) , and incubated with a 1 : 1 , 000 dilution of primary antibody 1605 in PERM buffer against the small T antigen of SV40 for 120 min . Plates were washed with PBS , and a dilution of secondary antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 dilution of goat anti - mouse antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 ; Invitrogen ) and Hoechst 33258 dye ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Invitrogen ) in PERM buffer was applied for 30 min . Sixteen images per well for each channel ( nucleus / Hoechst 33258 and T antigen / Alexa Fluor 488 ) were acquired on a Pathway 855 automated microscope station ( Becton Dickinson ) using a 10 (cid:1) objective ( Olympus ) and a laser - based autofocus every second image . Cell numbers ( CN ) and raw infection indices ( rawII ) for each well were determined using a MATLAB - based infection scoring procedure ( Mathworks ) . Since cell density affects SV40 infection , the effect of cell density on the infection index was determined with an independent check - erboard . Brieﬂy , various amounts of HeLa cells per well , transfected with All - StarsNegative siRNA , were infected with SV40 under screening conditions . From the obtained infection indices for each cell density , a polynomial regression function , normII (cid:5) f ( CN ) , was calculated . Density - corrected relative infection indices ( corrRII ) for each well of the screen were determined with the following equation : corrRII (cid:1) rawII normII CN and corrRII data were further processed by using the RNAi screen analysis software package cellHTS2 ( 7 ) . Both features were independently normalized against the AllStarsNegative control within each plate , followed by the z - score calculation ( zCN and zII , respectively ) and standardization over all replicate experiments essentially as described in the cellHTS2 software man - ual ( http : / / bioconductor . org / packages / 2 . 5 / bioc / html / cellHTS2 . html ) . A cell number cutoff of zCN (cid:6) target siRNA (cid:2) (cid:2) 3 ( about 500 imaged cells per well ) was applied to discard all siRNAs that strongly reduced the cell number . From the remaining siRNAs , those siRNAs whose z score of infection was outside a bandwidth of 5 - fold the standard deviation of all AllStarsNegative control siRNA z scores [ zII (cid:6) target siRNA (cid:7) (cid:8) 5 (cid:1) SD ( zII (cid:6) AllStarsNegative ) (cid:8) ] were consid - ered “signiﬁcant . ” Genes affecting SV40 infection ( “hits” ) were deﬁned by at least 2 signiﬁcant targeting siRNAs decreasing virus infection . The change of infection for each hit as a percentage of the negative control ( 100 % ) , shown in Table 1 , was approximated from the mean zII of all signiﬁcant siRNAs of this particular hit based on a logarithmic regression of the siRNA z scores of infection to their corresponding infection index averaged over all replicate experiments . RESULTS SV40 infection depends on endosomal proteins . To identify cellular factors involved in SV40 infection , we performed a targeted siRNA silencing screen with HeLa cells against a selection of 108 cellular proteins known to be involved in various aspects of endocytosis ( see Fig . S1A in the supplemen - tal material ) . Table S1 in the supplemental material shows the full list of proteins targeted and the siRNAs used . Materials and Methods provides a detailed description of the experi - mental procedure . Three nonoverlapping siRNAs were used against each gene . Seventy - two hours after siRNA transfec - tion , cells were infected with SV40 , and after a further 24 h , they were ﬁxed and subjected to Hoechst staining to visualize all nuclei and indirect immunoﬂuorescence using antibodies against the SV40 T antigen to identify the nuclei of infected cells ( Fig . S1D and S1E ) ( 43 ) . Proteins were deﬁned as hits when at least two of the three siRNAs showed a signiﬁcant decrease or increase in the num - ber of infected cells , i . e . , when the average z score of infection was at least ﬁve times the standard deviation of the z scores of all negative - control siRNAs ( see Fig . S1C in the supplemental material ) . Typically , this meant a reduction in infected cells by 50 % or more . Figure S1B in the supplemental material shows the range of effects that transfection with siRNAs had on the cell number and on the infection index in the full set of samples analyzed . Also shown is the effect of a nontargeting siRNA control ( AllStarsNegative ) and a transfection control ( Hs _ KIF11 _ 6 / EG5 ; Qiagen ) , which were present in every plate . Of the 324 siRNAs used , 26 were found to be toxic , judging by a dramatic drop in cell number . These were not considered in our analysis . A total of 30 proteins were identiﬁed as hits ( Table 1 ) . They fell into many different protein classes . However , it was evident that a large number ( 18 in total ) had functions associated with endosomes . The endosome - related hits in - cluded Rab5a , Rab5b , Rab5c , Rab4a , Rab22a , the GTPase dynamin - 2 ( DNM2 ) , and hepatocyte - related substrate ( Hrs or Hgs ) . The knockdown levels of some of the proteins were determined by a quantitative analysis of Western blots . For example , the expression of the proteins Rab4a , Rab5a , Hrs , and DNM2 was reduced to less than 17 % for the best siRNAs ( see Fig . S2 in the supplemental material ) . Further studies are needed to validate the hits and to eluci - date the roles that the 30 proteins play in infection . However , the ﬁnding that almost two - thirds of the hits were intimately associated with the regulation and function of classical endo - somal compartments implied that endosomes play an impor - tant role in SV40 infection . SV40 enters endosomes . To analyze to what extent the in - coming virus entered endosomes , indirect immunoﬂuores - cence microscopy , quantitative live - cell imaging , and electron microscopy ( EM ) were employed . Imaging of live cells was used for most of the colocalization and quantitation experi - ments because we recently found that many LEs and endoly - sosomes in CV - 1 cells burst and lose their contents during ﬁxation with the formaldehyde - based ﬁxatives used for immu - noﬂuorescence ( 25 ) . Moreover , the rounded shape of late en - dosomal compartments familiar from EM and live - cell imaging is often lost . Compare , for example , the stainings of LAMP1 , a 4200 ENGEL ET AL . J .

The ﬁxation artifacts make the visualization and quantita - tion of cargo such as viruses in late endocytic organelles by immunoﬂuorescence difﬁcult and irreproducible . This may , in fact , explain in part why in the past we have failed to observe viruses in LEs . To avoid adverse effects of overexpression , we limited our observations to cells that expressed reporter constructs at very low levels . This was made possible by the use of a spinning - disc confocal microscope equipped with a highly sensitive EM - CCD camera . Colocalization was quantiﬁed by using a MATLAB - based algorithm . Viruses were detected by pixel size and intensity . When 50 % of the virus pixels or more over - lapped with the objects ( endosomal vesicles ) in the second channel , viruses were counted as colocalizing . For quantiﬁca - tion , 50 to 100 viruses ( per cell ) in 5 to 15 cells from at least three different experiments were analyzed per time point . The colocalization of ﬂuorescently labeled SV40 with EE markers was reproducibly observed both by indirect immuno - ﬂuorescence microscopy of ﬁxed cells and by live - cell imaging of cells expressing XFP - tagged EE markers . Figure 1A shows a confocal section of a ﬁxed cell in which the virus particles are green and the EEA1 - containing organelles are immunostained in red . Many of the EEA1 - positive endosomes contained virus particles . The green spots at the periphery of the cell represent viruses that have not been internalized . After 90 min , the fraction of SV40 cells colocalizing with endogenous EEA1 amounted to 7 . 6 % (cid:9) 1 . 7 % of the total cell - associated viruses . Figure 1B shows a similar confocal section ( although closer to the plasma membrane plane ) with an extensive colocaliza - tion of red ﬂuorescent virus with green Rab5 - EGFP in a living , unﬁxed cell . Viruses could also be detected in Hrs - EGFP - positive organelles in live cells expressing this ESCRT 0 com - ponent ( Fig . 1C ) . The Rab5 - EGFP - positive EEs containing SV40 were often small and peripheral , whereas EEs containing EEA1 and Hrs - EGFP were larger and located in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1A and C ) . In live cells , SV40 particles could be seen to move together with Rab5 - and Rab7 - mRFP - con - taining organelles in the cytoplasm , indicating that colocaliza - tion was not coincidental ( Fig . 1D and see Movies S1 to S3 in the supplemental material ) .

The LEs and endolysosomes were round and displayed ring - like mem - brane ﬂuorescence . The labeled SV40 could be seen to move together with the endosomes through the cytoplasm ( see Movies S3 and S4 in the supplemental material ) . In a previous publication , we had observed that infection is inhibited by the expression of constitutively active Rab5Q ( Rab5Q79L ) ( 42 ) . It was recently shown that the overexpres - sion of Rab5Q causes an efﬁcient block in LE maturation at the level of the maturing endosome ( 65 ) . To identify the in - tracellular location of SV40 in CV - 1 cells overexpressing Rab5Q , we added SV40 - AF647 . At 2 h after the addition of virus , most virus particles localized to the sorting - defective , enlarged endosomes ( Fig . 2C ) . Quantitation after ﬁxation and immunoﬂuorescence showed that the colocalization of SV40 particles with endogenous LAMP1 peaked at 15 . 6 % (cid:9) 1 . 9 % at 90 min postwarming . However , in live cells where quantitation was not affected by the ﬁxation - induced organelle disruption , the level of colocal - ization with LAMP1 - EGFP and Rab7 - EGFP was much higher . In Rab7 - EGFP - expressing cells , it increased linearly with time and reached 49 . 9 % (cid:9) 10 . 1 % of the cell - associated virus after 4 . 5 h ( Fig . 1E ) . To conﬁrm that SV40 transport to late endosomal com - partments also occurred in untransfected cells , we pre - loaded the late endosomes and lysosomes by exposing CV - 1 cells to ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - dextran for 4 h , followed by a 20 - h incubation in the absence of the ﬂuores - cent ﬂuid - phase marker . SV40 - AF647 was then allowed to enter the cells for 4 h . When the cells were viewed by confocal microscopy , we clearly observed the majority of viruses within FITC - dextran - containing late endosomes and lysosomes ( Fig . 2D ) . When EM was performed 2 h after the addition of virus to cells , SV40 particles ( Fig . 3A ) were seen in smooth - walled , close - ﬁtting invaginations of the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3B ) , in membrane - bounded vesicles in the peripheral cytoplasm ( Fig . 3C ) , in endosome - like structures devoid of intralumenal vesicles ( Fig . 3D ) ( 26 , 28 ) , and in multivesicular body ( MVB ) late endosomes ( Fig . 3E ) . At 19 h , they had reached smooth regions of the ER ( Fig . 3G ) , but some were present in multi - lamellar bodies ( MLBs ) ( Fig . 3F ) . At no time were virus par - FIG . 2 .

At 240 min after warming to 37°C , cells were imaged with a confocal microscope .

Taken together , the data indicated that the internalized SV40 entered peripheral and perinuclear EEs and also LEs , many of which were present as MVBs and MLBs . After 4 h , when the ﬁrst virus particles enter the ER ( 53 ) , more than 80 % of the internalized viruses were associated with endosomal compartments . The reason that the EE - associated pool re - mained relatively small ( less than 20 % of the total cell - associ - ated virus ) was most likely the slow and asynchronous arrival of virus from the plasma membrane combined with a continuous movement of viruses from EEs to LEs . A similar progression from EEs to LEs was recently observed for mPy , which also transits via endosomes to the ER ( 46 ) . Elevation of vacuolar pH blocks SV40 infection . The asso - ciation of SV40 with endosomes raised the question of whether this trafﬁcking route plays a role in productive infection . First , we analyzed the effects of inhibitors known to raise the lumenal pH of endosomes and lysosomes . In the presence of NH 4 Cl , the number of T - antigen - expressing cells was reduced to 15 % of the control , as determined by ﬂow cytometry . With monen - sin , a carboxylic ionophore , and baﬁlomycin A 1 ( Baf ) , an in - hibitor of the vacuolar ATPase responsible for endosome acid - iﬁcation , infection was almost completely inhibited ( Fig . 4A ) . When Baf was added at different times after the addition of SV40 , the sensitive step was found to occur with a midpoint of 90 min after cell warming . This fast - acting inhibitor thus af - fected an early step in SV40 infection coinciding approximately with virus internalization ( Fig . 4B ) . Baf also inhibited SV40 infection in ﬁbroblasts derived from caveolin - 1 knockout mice , indicating that the caveolin - independent infection pathway also required acidiﬁcation ( Fig . 4C ) . The drugs did not affect cell viability . Overall , cell morphology was normal except for the swelling of endocytic vacuoles observed with NH 4 Cl and monensin ( see below ) . To analyze which steps in the infectious pathway were blocked , we employed a quantitative internalization assay based on a spe - ciﬁc ﬂuorophore , AF488 , covalently attached to SV40 particles . AF488 can be quenched by the addition of the membrane - imper - meable dye trypan blue ( 63 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . FIG . 3 . SV40 enters endosomal structures and the ER .

When Baf , NH 4 Cl , or monensin was present , only 20 % of the virus par - ticles were internalized ( Fig . 4D ) . The block in SV40 internal - ization caused by monensin was reported previously ( 54 ) . EM conﬁrmed that in monensin - treated cells at as late as 22 h postwarming , most SV40 particles remained trapped in plasma membrane invaginations ( Fig . 4E ) . The minor populations of particles internalized were in MVBs and MLBs ( Fig . 4F ) . Also , in Baf - treated cells , the majority of SV40 particles remained on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4G ) , but in this case , the few particles that were internalized were seen in endo - somal structures devoid of intralumenal membranes ( Fig . 4H ) . The result could be conﬁrmed by live - cell microscopy : the few internalized SV40 - AF647 particles colocalized exclusively with Rab5 - mRFP in Baf - treated cells , while in monensin - and in NH 4 Cl - treated cells , the viruses colocalized mainly with Rab7 - mRFP ( Fig . 6 and see Movies S5 and S6 in the supplemental material ) . Baf caused a loss of the round , ring - like Rab5 stain - ing observed for control cells , whereas NH 4 Cl and monensin caused an expansion of both Rab5 - and Rab7 - positive vacuoles ( Fig . 6A , C , and D ) . Taken together , the data showed that infection was inhibited by all three pH perturbants . While the binding of viruses to the cell surface was unaffected , internalization was strongly re - duced . NH 4 Cl and monensin allowed the few viruses that were internalized to enter LEs and MVBs . Baf seemed to interfere with endosome maturation at an earlier stage , with the virus arrested in modiﬁed EEs . These observations were consistent with the notion that SV40 uses the endosomal pathway for infection and that an elevation of the pH in acidic organelles can introduce multiple blocks in the infectious pathway ( 5 , 6 , 9 , 61 ) . Molecular requirements for passage to the ER via LEs . The movement of cargo from EEs to LEs relies on a complicated endosomal maturation process that involves a multitude of cellular factors ( 39 ) . Among them , microtubules are important because they mediate the movement of the maturing endo - FIG . 4 . Acid dependence of internalization and infection .

The disruption of microtubules by nocodazole efﬁciently inhibits SV40 infection but does not affect internalization ( Fig . 7A and F ) . The virus particles do not reach the ER ( 44 ) . At 4 h postwarming , EM of nocodazole - treated cells showed viral particles in endosome - like organelles ( Fig . 7B ) and in MVBs ( Fig . 7C ) . With live - cell microscopy , SV40 - AF647 was present in vacuoles positive for both Rab5 - EGFP and Rab7 - mRFP ( Fig . 7D ) . Over time , we could observe that the major - ity of internalized virus particles ( Fig . 7A and E ) accumulated in two types of organelles : Rab5 - positive endosomes devoid of Rab7 , and Rab5 - and Rab7 - positive maturing endosomes in which the viruses were located in the Rab7 - positive domains ( Fig . 7D ) . The latter organelles corresponded to previously described intermediates in LE maturation arrested by the in - hibition of microtubule function ( 3 , 5 , 62 ) . Being reversible , the nocodazole effect provided a conve - nient method to divide the entry pathway into two phases : early events up to and including the maturing endosomes and late events during which the viruses moved to LEs and eventually to the ER . When CV - 1 cells were incubated with nocodazole for 8 h after the addition of SV40 followed by a nocodazole washout , infection recovered to 75 % of control levels ( Fig . 7F ) ( 53 ) . When nocodazole was replaced at the time of washout with other inhibitors , it was possible to study the inhibitor sensitivity of steps in the entry pathway downstream of the nocodazole block ( Fig . 7F ) . Among the drugs that inhibited infection after the nocoda - zole washout were the acidiﬁcation inhibitors monensin and Baf . The inhibitory effects of genistein ( a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) , orthovanadate ( OV ) ( an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases ) , and okadaic acid ( OA ) ( an inhibitor of Ser / Thr phosphatases ) pointed to a role for tyrosine and Ser / Thr phos - phorylation . Judging by the strong inhibitory effect of brefeldin A ( BFA ) , Arf proteins seemed to play a role both early and late in the pathway , consistent with previously reported data ( 41 , 50 ) . In addition to disrupting vesicle transport within the Golgi complex and from the Golgi complex to the ER , BFA is known to induce the tubulation of endosomes and inhibit cargo transport from EEs to endolysosomes ( 33 , 58 ) . The ﬁnding that calphostin C failed to inhibit infection after the nocodazole washout suggested that the role of protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( two hits in the siRNA screen ) was upstream of the nocodazole block . One of the inhibitors that blocked infection in a postnocoda - zole step was dynasore , an inhibitor of DNM2 ( 36 ) . At a concentration that did not cause cell toxicity , it caused more FIG . 5 .

DNM2 was also a strong hit in the siRNA infection screen ( Table 1 ) . The overexpression of a dominant negative DNM2 construct was shown previously to reduce infection ( 45 ) . However , the quan - titative internalization assay showed that in the case of SV40 , it was not the endocytic uptake that was inhibited by dynasore but rather a downstream event ( Fig . 7G ) . Taken together , the results indicated that the regulation of the latter part of the pathway of intracellular virus transport is complex and dependent on numerous cellular factors . It was apparent that some of the inhibitors such as BFA , the acidiﬁ - cation inhibitors , and genistein affected processes both before and after the nocodazole block . The effects seen were consis - tent with the passage of the infectious virus through the LEs on its way to the ER . DISCUSSION The most important conclusion from our studies is that SV40 passes through a series of classical endocytic organelles during infectious entry into host cells . These include EEs , maturing hybrid endosomes , LEs with the properties of mul - tivesicular and multilamellar bodies , and , most likely , endoly - sosomes . The pathway is schematically shown in Fig . 8 . Passage occurs slowly and nonsynchronously , with the arrival of viruses in the ER several hours after the initial internalization ( 53 ) . Taken together , the observations failed to support our pre - vious model in which SV40 was routed to the ER via caveolin - 1 - positive nonendosomal organelles , which we called caveo - somes , bypassing the endosomes ( 44 ) . The main reasons for abandoning the caveosome model at this time are 2 - fold . First , the results presented here speak clearly for the endosome - based trafﬁcking of the incoming virus and a role for endo - somes in productive infection . Second , we have found in recent studies that caveosomes as originally described are likely to represent modiﬁed LEs or endolysosomes ( 25 ) . We observed that caveolin - rich “caveosomes” arise when caveolar assembly is compromised by the overexpression of caveolin - 1 constructs , by the reduction of cholesterol , and by the depletion of cavins . The unassembled caveolin - 1 generated under these conditions is ubiquitinated and endocytosed , and it accumulates in in - FIG . 6 .

The original experiments that led to the caveosome model for SV40 entry were performed with cells overexpress - ing caveolin - 1 ( 42 , 44 ) . The confusion was enhanced by the lack of appropriate LE markers and the difﬁculty that we now recognize in the ﬁxation of late endosomal compartments in CV - 1 cells with formaldehyde without a loss of contents , in - cluding virus particles ( 25 ) .

A decrease in infectivity was observed after depleting proteins such as Rab5a , Rab5b , Rab5c , Hrs , c - Cbl , Rab4a , Rab11b , SNX15 , PIK3C3 , DNM2 , and arrestin beta - 2 . These proteins are known to play a variety of roles in cargo transport to endosomes , in endosome function , and in endosome regulation ( 24 ) . Light microscopy experiments conﬁrmed that more than 80 % of the internalized SV40 particles trafﬁcked to Rab5 - positive , EEA1 - positive , and Hrs - positive EEs as well as to LAMP1 - positive , Rab7 - positive , Rab9 - positive , and FITC - dex - tran - positive LEs and endolysosomes . EM substantiated the presence of viruses in endosomal structures . Agents that raise the pH of endocytic organelles were found to inhibit infection . Their main inhibitory effect involved the internalization of bound virus . The mechanisms behind the endocytosis block are not clear , but the effect explains in part the high sensitivity of SV40 infection to pH perturbants . In addition , the fraction of viruses that was internalized ( about 20 % ) failed to move beyond Rab5 - positive EEs in the presence of Baf and beyond LEs in the presence of monensin . This was not unexpected , since a block in endosome maturation and cargo transport to lysosomes is one of the consequences often observed after interfering with the acidiﬁcation of endosomes ( 5 , 6 , 9 , 54 , 61 ) . The inhibitory effect of monensin on the internalization and intracellular trafﬁcking of SV40 was observed previously by others ( 54 ) . In addition , it was recently reported that mPy and two human polyomaviruses , BK and JC viruses , require acid - iﬁcation for infection ( 4 , 27 , 32 ) . However , in two previous reports , investigators failed to observe an inhibition of SV40 infection in the presence of acidiﬁcation perturbants ( 4 , 60 ) . The difference may be technical : in our experiments we took into consideration that the entry process is slow , and we ex - tended the drug treatment accordingly . We also made certain FIG . 8 . Model of infectious SV40 entry into CV - 1 cells . SV40 binds to its receptor ( GM1 ) , partitions into lipid rafts , and induces internalization from the plasma membrane either by a caveola - mediated or a caveolin - 1 - independent , lipid raft - dependent endocytosis mechanism . The virus is transported to Rab5 - , EEA1 - , and Hrs - positive EEs . When these endosomes acquire Rab7 , SV40 associates with the Rab7 - positive domains . Through endosome maturation , viruses become lumenal components of LAMP1 - , Rab9 - , and Rab7 - positive LEs and eventually endolysosomes . The vacuolar ATPase ( v - ATPase ) is responsible for the acidiﬁcation of endosomes and lysosomes . Acidiﬁcation is required for SV40 internal - ization and subsequent transport steps . Virus transport to the ER occurs from the late compartments of the endocytic pathway by an unknown mechanism either directly or , less likely , via the Golgi complex . Early and late events in the entry pathway can be blocked by various inhibitors and other perturbants . References to the effects of different drugs reported in the literature are given .

The ﬁnding that the sorting of SV40 deep into the degrada - tive branch of the endocytic pathway is a requirement for infection was best illustrated by the effect of perturbations that interfered with endosome maturation . Previously ( 42 ) , we had observed that infection is inhibited by the expression of con - stitutively active Rab5Q , which causes an efﬁcient block in LE maturation at the level of the maturing endosome ( 18 , 65 ) . In addition , we observed that infection was inhibited when the formation of intralumenal vesicles was blocked by depleting Hrs and other components of the ubiquitin - dependent machin - ery necessary for LE formation ( Table 1 ) ( 49 ) . Furthermore , infection was inhibited when endosomal trafﬁcking along mi - crotubules was disturbed by nocodazole and when acidiﬁcation inhibitors were used ( 54 ) . SV40 shares its dependence on en - dosome maturation with a number of late - penetrating viruses such as inﬂuenza A virus , rhinovirus , mPy , bunyavirus , and parvovirus ( 19 , 35 , 39 , 67 ) . Several inhibitors and perturbants were found to prevent infection after a nocodazole block ( Fig . 7F ) . The Baf and monensin sensitivity demonstrated a requirement for acidiﬁ - cation late in the pathway in addition to its role during early entry ( 5 , 6 , 9 , 61 ) . The inhibitory effect of BFA conﬁrmed a late role for Arf proteins ( 41 , 50 , 64 ) . Kinases and phosphatases apparently play a role in both early and late stages of SV40 entry ( 43 ) . OV , an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases that dramatically increases the internal - ization of SV40 ( 45 ) , blocked infection late in the pathway , most likely by interfering with SV40 transport from endosomes to the ER . The ﬁnding that DNM2 was needed in a postno - codazole step was shown by the inhibitory effects of dynasore . In addition to its well - characterized role in primary endocytic processes , DNM2 was reported previously to support the trans - port of cholesterol and other cargo from endosomes to the ER and from endosomes to the Golgi complex ( 31 , 40 , 51 ) . The entry of SV40 shares many features with those of other polyomaviruses . The human BK virus , JC virus , and MCPyV as well as the mouse polyomavirus seem to require gangliosides for infectivity ( 14 , 15 , 21 , 22 , 30 , 34 , 46 , 55 , 59 ) . While the entry pathways of the most recently discovered human polyomavi - ruses have not yet been investigated in detail , mPy , BK virus , and JC virus are known to enter endosomes and depend on acidiﬁcation ( 4 , 27 , 32 , 38 , 46 , 47 ) . In the case of the well - studied mPy , a role for recycling endosomes and late endo - somes was proposed ( 32 , 38 , 46 ) . Like SV40 , other polyoma - viruses are transported to the ER lumen and seem to take advantage of the ER machinery for uncoating and membrane penetration ( 27 , 37 , 46 ) . Why do polyomaviruses use such a complicated entry path - way ? One reason is that since their capsids are stabilized by a network of disulﬁde bonds , they require access to thiol oxido - reductases and chaperones in the ER lumen for initial uncoat - ing ( 37 , 53 ) . Moreover , there is increasing evidence that the membrane penetration of the viruses depends on components of the ER - associated degradation pathway ( 27 , 37 , 53 ) . An endosomal pathway to the ER is also used by bacterial toxins such as Shiga and cholera toxins . Like polyomaviruses , these have homopentameric binding subunits that associate with and cluster glycosphingolipid receptors ( 15 , 16 , 52 ) . The similarities suggest that multimeric glycosphingolipid binding and associ - ation with cholesterol - containing lipid domains provide viruses and toxins an entry ticket not only to endosomes but also , as recently suggested by Qian et al . , to an extension of the journey from endosomes to the ER ( 46 ) .
