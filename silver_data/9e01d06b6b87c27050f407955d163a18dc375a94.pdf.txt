The Organizational Memory ( OM ) conceptualizing how the process of creation , storage and dissemination of knowledge over time can influence the actions and decisions of the organization . For this , it is necessary that the attention of individuals to be targeted and aligned , noticing the stimuli from the environment , and directing the time and cognitive effort towards the decisions to be made in the organization . This scenario , the paper provides a discussion of 22 case studies found in literature that were analyzed using the Attention - Based View of the Firm as a guiding lens . This analysis shows some evidence and relevant implications of the use of Social Media in the organizational context as well as a first theoretical description of how the focus of attention of decision makers influence the development of OM . Keywords knowledge , competitive , decision makers , attention Introduction In an increasingly globalized world , where information is increasingly available and the barriers of communication and collaboration between individuals are increasingly narrow , it is an undeniable fact that we “live in a world where people have opportunities to connect , communicate , and collaborate in ways that were once inconceivable . ” ( Everson et al . 2013 , p . A69 ) . It is also known that organizations are aware that the knowledge generated in the organization over time is one of the primary factors to remain competitive on the market . “That organizations need to know what they already know to use that knowledge in present collective and individual decisions and actions and also in projections of the future . ” ( Ramos 2011 , p . 1 ) . This causes organizations to seek strategies and tools that preserve this knowledge generated over time and create mechanisms to stimulate and empower its professionals to share knowledge and use part of this accumulated knowledge to support improvements and innovation in the organization ( Barnier et al . 2008 ) , whether in the generation of new products ( Kim et al . 2013 ; Olivera 2000 ; Wang and Ahmed 2003 ) , in solving problems ( Dorasamy et al . 2013 ; Hamid and Salim 2010 ) and also in decision - making ( Allahawiah et al . 2012 ; McCaughey and Bruning 2010 ; Toulabi et al . 2012 ) . Thus , the Organizational Memory ( OM ) – as a theoretical concept – enters in the interim as a way to help understanding how processes of creation , storage , dissemination and application of knowledge in the organization unfold over time ( Abecker et al . 1998 ; Ackerman 1994 ; Alavi and Leidner 2001 ; Stein and Zwass 1995 ) and how the accumulated knowledge can influence the present and future actions and decisions of the organization ( Chang and Cho 2008 ; Rowlinson et al . 2010 ; Walsh and Ungson 1991 ) . For this development of OM be effective and harmonious , it is necessary that the individuals ' attention is directed and aligned so that they perceive the relevant stimuli from the organizational environment and Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 2 effectively use their time and cognitive effort to perform the actions or decisions that provide the best possible answers to the perceived stimuli . Additionally , it is necessary that the technological tools be planned in this scenario . With Social Media , organizations gain a set of tools that align perfectly in different actions , strategies and functions in the organization , whether they are in project management ( Böhringer et al . 2009 ) , relationship with customers ( Bughin et al . 2011 ) , dissemination of corporate information ( Smith and Harwood 2011 ) , on learning of individuals is at the individual level , organizational or team ( King 2011 ) , or even on the decentralization of work in General in the Organization ( Kohler et al . 2011 ; McAfee 2006 ) . All this in order to provide an environment conducive for information and experience sharing by strengthening the construction of open communication ( Duane and Finnegan 2003 ; Fournier and Avery 2011 ; Hanna et al . 2011 ; Kaplan and Haenlein 2010 ; Smith and Harwood 2011 ) , and an organizational culture of collaboration and trust ( Fournier and Avery 2011 ; Jackson et al . 2007 ; Smith and Harwood 2011 ) . The study described in this paper is a first attempt to answer the research question : How Social Media can be used to guide the attention of decision makers towards better creation , storage , dissemination and application of knowledge in the organization ? Therefore , this investigation is an important step towards understanding the potential of Social Media in the organizational context as focusing instruments of the decision - makers ' attention to the creation , sharing and application of organizational knowledge required to develop of the Organizational Memory . The structure of this paper is as follows . Section 2 describes the approaches and methods supporting this study . Then , the Section 3 describes the theoretical basis necessary for the analysis proposed in this paper . Section 4 compares and contrasts the case studies with the literature review seeking to elicit the effects of the use of Social Media in different organizational contexts . Section 5 discusses the theoretical implications of our research results by identifying some theoretical assumptions listed in Section 4 . Finally , Section 6 concludes with some implications about this study , its limitations and some implications for future studies . Materials and methods In this paper , we seek to perceive how Social Media can be used to guide the attention of decision - makers along the process of developing OM . A systematic review of the literature was performed , making it possible to identify , assess and interpret the relevant of papers addressing the relevant topics . The following sections describe the identification process and selection of literature . Literature review protocol The overall scenario for identification of literature used in this research is showed in Figure 1 . Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 3 Figure 1 . Research Scenario . Identification and selection of literature The selection of literature was performed in two steps . The first step corresponds to a selection of scientific papers related to the central research themes to elucidate the reader on two main theoretical perspectives guiding the research – Organizational Memory and Attention - Based View of the Firm – and the relationship of these theoretical perspectives with the information systems’ field , more specifically the use of Social Media in the organizational scenario . The search was carried out in some main international scientific databases , namely : Scopus , SpringerLink , IEEEXplore , Emerald , Web of Science and AIS Electronic Library ( AISeL ) . These databases were chosen because of their great prestige among the scientific community in general and , especially , because they hold a substantial number of scientific publications in the information systems area . The second step corresponds to a selection of scientific papers with case studies that evaluate , in its most varied aspects , the use of Social Media in the organizational scenario in order to empirically investigate the main theoretical perspectives used in our research . It was carried out a systematic collection of relevant case studies on Scopus , Web of Science and recent AISeL scientific bases , from 2009 to 2013 referring , whether in the title , abstract or keyword , the terms “Case Study Research” or “Multiple Case Study Research” , and “Social Media” within the organizational scenario . On the basis of this Boolean search , with clusters of keywords mentioned above , 172 scientific papers were accessed , 20 of these being indexed in more than one base , totaling 152 papers . Table 1 describes this result . Table 1 . Number of publications in the Scopus , Web of Science and AISeL databases related to papers with case studies of Social Media from 2009 to 2013 .

We identified that most of these papers were focused on case studies related to very specific matters , such the use of Social Media in education , its benefits and harms in the teaching - learning process ( Balayeva and Quan - Haase 2009 ; Berkovich 2011 ; Hargreaves 2011 ; Hatakka et al . 2013 ; Lantz - Andersson et al . 2013 ; LaRue 2012 ; Mackness et al . 2013 ; Menkhoff and Bengtsson 2012 ; Nández and Borrego 2013 ; Potter and Banaji 2012 ; Schejter and Tirosh 2012 ) ; customer’ satisfaction and / or their interaction with the organization mediated by the use of Social Media ( Cai et al . 2008 ; Chauhan and Pillai 2013 ; Culnan et al . 2010 ; Hanna et al . 2011 ; Hopkins 2012 ; O’Shea and Alonso 2011 , 2013 ; Shirazi 2013 ; Unsworth and Townes 2012 ; Wikström and Ellonen 2012 ; Zhang and Yue 2013 ) ; movements and political decisions about social and environmental issues in Social Media ( Bernardo et al . 2013 ; Holmberg 2013 ; Hvass 2013 ; Luoma - aho et al . 2013 ; Martyn and Gallant 2012 ; Näkki et al . 2011 ; Schwarz 2012 ; Segaard and Nielsen 2013 ; Vicari 2013 ; Wolfsfeld et al . 2013 ) ; studies of networks and monitoring of data generated from the organizations’ exposure in Social Media ( Bygstad and Presthus 2013 ; Chua and Banerjee 2013 ; Stocker and Mayer 2012 ; Sykora 2011 ; Tufekci 2013 ) ; analysis of the opportunities and risks of the use of Social Media in the well - being and health promotion in the community ( Betton and Tomlinson 2013 ; Gupta et al . 2013 ; Mitra and Padman 2012 ; Neiger et al . 2013 ) ; among other topics relevant to this study . Based on the focus of the collected papers , and taking into account the alignment of the paper’s topic with the purpose of our research , 40 papers that clearly specified the study of Social Media within an organizational setting in the title , abstract and / or keywords were selected From these papers were selected 22 cases for further analysis . The choice of these cases is due to the high degree of detailed research and extensive description of the use of Social Media in the organizational setting . The relationship and the description of the selected case studies can be viewed in Table 2 . Table 2 . Cases selected for further analysis . ID YEAR AUTHOR JOURNAL C01 ( 2013 ) Theodore E .

Papan Development in Practice Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 5 Theoretical foundation In order to explore how the Social Media guide the attention of organizational actors and the development of effective organizational memory , this literature review focused studies that address three central themes – Social Media , Organizational Memory and the Attention - Based View of the Firm . Information technologies as enhancers of knowledge : the Social Media The Social Media is playing a growing role in the creation , dissemination and application of information , supporting cooperation and the sharing of individual experience ( Everson et al . 2013 ; Kietzmann et al . 2011 ; Yates and Paquette 2011 ; Yates et al . 2010 ) . In the organizational context , Social Media seem to play a particularly important and significant role in addressing organizational agents ' attention , stimulate collaboration and sharing of knowledge and experiences between individuals in the organization ( Metter et al . 2008 ; Yates and Paquette 2011 ; Yates et al . 2010 ) . A research conducted by Larker ( 2012 ) with representatives of top management such as CEOs , senior executives and Board and Management members , has analyzed how the use of Social Media influenced the practices and strategies of their organizations . According to the survey , the use of Social Media represents a consistent medium of direct interaction , improving collaboration and communication in the organization , both internally between members of the organization and externally with customers , suppliers , shareholders and other stakeholders . In addition , other advantages were listed such as : ability of the companies to collect market information about stakeholders , competitors and industries ; quick disclosure of the company , its products , services and activities ; source of information on how customers , employees , suppliers , shareholders , and others see the company , its products , services and activities ( Scott and Jacka 2011 ) . “Different initiatives emphasize different types of content collaboration and different types of content , be it informative , creative or communicative” ( Ala - Mutka 2008 , p . 9 ) . Social Media enable the creation , modification , improvement or discussion of contents directed and developed according to own organization ' s guidelines . Wikis , blogs , social networks , business networks and many other Social Media are the most common examples of these highly popular collaborative applications and are of high impact in organizations . In a research conducted by ( Anderson 2010 ) , authors stressed the importance of these new collaborative mechanisms for the organization and showed the role of Wikipedia , Blogs , micro blogs and social networks – the current Social Media phenomena used in the organizational context – played in creation of knowledge . The study identified significant benefits to the organization brought by Social Media , both for business processes and decision - making . The paper concludes that Social Media effectively support collaboration required for giving rise to several innovative business models that challenge the already established organizations and generate value for organizations that know how to exploit them to their own favor . The Organizational Memory ( OM ) Increasingly , organizations are aware that the knowledge generated over time is one of the key factors to remain competitive on the market . However , most of this knowledge is not absorbed by the organization because it is retained in the individuals or is lost over time ( Meyer and Marion 2013 ) . The Organizational Memory ( OM ) allows this knowledge to be accumulated over time , distributed and applied within the organization . “Organizational Memory ( OM ) may be thought of as comprising stocks of data , information , and knowledge ( the memories ) that have been accumulated by an organization over its history . When an individual accesses OM , he performs an act of interpretation on the memory ( ies ) that is ( are ) accessed and may or may not act on it ( them ) . ” ( Cegarra - Navarro and Sánchez - Polo 2011 , p . 1 ) . Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 6 One of the earliest accepted models of organizational memory was proposed by ( Walsh and Ungson 1991 ) that , from a synthesis of several studies and past achievements , have viewed OM as the process of obtaining , retaining and retrieving information , therefore bringing information from the past to be applied in the present . This is a static conception of how knowledge is shared and focuses solely on the information generated in the organization to enhance decision - making . Therefore , it was proposed a functional view of OM in which the structure initially proposed by ( Walsh and Ungson 1991 ) evolved to include the continuous interactions between the members of the organization , supported by artifacts that support the memory processes ( Hofmann and Morgeson 1999 ) . In this approach , the OM involves all activities of the organization at all levels of influence , including policies , standards , communication , culture , size , resources , technologies , giving rise to the organizational identity ( Assmann and Czaplicka 1995 ; Barnier et al . 2008 ; Coman et al . 2009 ; Halbwachs 1992 ; Hirst and Manier 2008 ; Ricoeur 2004 ) . Despite the wide literature on OM , the scientific knowledge produced about organizational memory is fragmented ( Ackerman and Halverson 2004 ; Lehner and Maier 2000 ) without holistic methodological tools to support managers in the diagnosis of OM ( Casey and Olivera 2003 ; Nevo et al . 2008 ) . To address problem , a new model of OM is being developed at the University of Minho that uses the human memory model – discussed in areas such as cognitive psychology and neuroscience – as a reference metaphor to conceptualize how organizations retains knowledge in a distributed way in all organizational activities ( Ramos 2011 ) . This model shows the OM as a distributed component and active in the organization , which accumulates knowledge and facilitates its use in actions and decision - making in the organization . To validate this model , the authors describe a set of theories that are organized according to the way that knowledge is created and moves to integrate in the organization up to their institutionalization . These theories , which are recognized by the high explanatory power and proven usefulness in various fields of study , directly or indirectly , discuss knowledge as primary resource for organizations , seeking to understand the organizational phenomena and trying to explain the processes that guide this trajectory of knowledge . In accordance with the purpose of this paper , Section 3 . 3 describes one of these theories , the Attention - Based View of the Firm , which justifies the prospect that the behavior of individuals is directly related to how organizations allocate , distribute and regulate their makers ' attention on a particular organizational context . The attention focus and its influence on the decision - making process An abundance of information are placed daily for individuals in the organizations , leading to high levels of attention deficit ( Briggs 2004 ; Javadi et al . 2013 ; Vreede and Dickson 2000 ) . Individuals can focus only on a limited amount of information at each moment ; thus mechanisms and strategies are needed that allow the individuals ' attention is guided to the most necessary and relevant information to the performed activities and decisions . The Attention - Based View of the Firm explains that the behavior of individuals in organizations is directly related to how organizations allocate , distribute and regulate the attention of their decision - makers . “At the level of individual cognition , attention processes focus the energy , effort , and mindfulness of organizational decision - makers on a limited set of elements that enter into consciousness at any given time . ” ( Ocasio 1997 , p . 190 ) . In this sense , it is necessary that the decision makers focus their energy , effort and attention on a limited number of aspects in order to achieve a sustained strategic performance . This energy and effort , because they are limited resources , should be directed to aspects that are most relevant to ensure the success of organizations ( Ekelund and Räisänen 2011 ; Gavetti et al . 2012 ; Javadi et al . 2013 ; Ocasio and Joseph 2008 ; Ocasio 1997 , 1999 ; Sullivan 2010 ) . According to the theory , any decision has a focus , a context , and a structure constraint . Therefore , in order to ensure success in their decisions , three factors must be taken into account when designing work systems : ( i ) the focus of attention ; ( ii ) the context in which the attention is aimed ; and ( iii ) the conditioning structure that involves this attention . Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 7 The focus of attention is directly related to the interest of decision - makers . This interest will orientate their attention to a particular set of issues and solutions determined by their decision environment . The elements contained in this set of issues are related to the problems , opportunities and existing threats that the decision - makers must focus their attention to make a decision . The solutions are sets of possible actions and decisions to be taken in the organization ; solutions may be proposals , projects , programs , routines and procedures ( Ocasio 1997 ) . It is in this subset of issues and solutions that decision - makers concentrate all their efforts , energy and attention , influencing directly their action . This context in which the attention is intended is related to the decision - making environment to which these individuals are . It is in this environment where decision - makers act , communicate , interact , and take their decisions , that is , it is here where the decision - makers direct , intended and shape in a structured way the attention in organizational scenario ( Ocasio 1997 ) . In this dimension there is a set of rules ; symbols ; beliefs ; environmental , social and cultural factors ; artifacts ; narratives and resources that affect and shape the attention of the decision - makers . Therefore , it is in this step that evaluates the communication both internally and externally , relationships and existing interactions , as well as the involvement of the individual within the organizational scenario . Finally , in order to ensure that the decision is effective and goals achieved , the theory defines that the distribution of the decision - makers’ attention should be structured within the organization . Namely , this factor focuses on the stable organizational structures that influence / guide the attention , including , for example , actions , situations , communication channels , routines and procedures in the organization . The importance of attention in decision - making and problem - solving has been noticed by scholars for many years . Examples of this research include an analysis of how effective targeting of attention has led to an institutional change in the chemical industry ( Hoffman 1999 ) ; verification of how collaborative participation brought more attention to the possibilities of formation of strategic alliances within the organization ( Rosenkopf and Nerkar 2001 ) ; the analysis of how attention to external events was shaped by threats to the image and identity of the industry ( Hoffman and Ocasio 2001 ) ; among others . A common point of understanding among these studies is that attention is considered a valuable resource for organizations and , like human and intellectual capital , it is a scarce resource that must be well managed to ensure greater responsiveness to strategic issues ( Davenport and Hall 2002 ; Ekelund and Räisänen 2011 ; Javadi et al . 2013 ; Sullivan 2010 ) , innovative and technological capabilities front to competitors ( Eggers and Kaplan 2009 ; Kaplan 2008 ) . Not only the individual but also the environment and interactions between these individuals interfere in knowledge sharing within the organization and this shaped the attention by the organization ' s structure , i . e . the formal structure , rules , culture , political leadership and resources ( Barnett 2008 ; Gavetti et al . 2012 ; Ocasio 1997 , 1999 ) . Other studies such as ( Levy 2005 ) where it was found that companies could be more prone to an expansive strategy when they paid attention to various elements in their internal and external environment ; ( Jacobides 2007 ) that studied how the effects of the labor division and the hierarchy in organizational units changed the attention focus and direction of the actions and decisions in the organization ; ( Marcel et al . 2011 ) that examined how cognitive guidance combined with environmental stimuli shaped attention , interpretation and rapid response to competition in the air sector ; and the analysis reported in ( Nigam and Ocasio 2010 ) to understand how the effective targeting of attention led to changes in institutional logics . These studies stress the current concern in analyzing how individuals ' attention can bring benefits to the organization . In general , the authors say that decision - makers are flooded by stimuli and concerns that should be directed to all decisions and actions are carried out in the organization . Evidence of this can be found in ( Ekelund and Räisänen 2011 ) where authors talk about the decisions that managers must make and the major changes that occurred within the organization during times of crisis ; or in ( Javadi et al . 2013 ) where the authors point out the importance of this theory in the area of information systems ( SI ) , more specifically in the definition of the interface of electronic brainstorming . Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 8 Case studies analysis and discussions This section summarizes 22 selected cases analyzed in order to gather evidence for the role Social Media may play in directing the decision - makers’ attention . To achieve this goal , the Attention - Based View of the Firm was used as the theoretical lens to interpret the selected case studies . In each case examined , the strategy underlying the adoption of Social Media and / or their actual use were analyzed . In order to synthesize the findings , Appendix A shows a conceptual framework with the organizational demographics , actions and / or strategies cited in the analyzed case studies , grouped the light of Attention - Based view of the Firm theory . It is worth mentioning that this reading of the papers is interpretive . Specifically , we seek to understand how the attention devoted , located and structured , move in order to establish an environment conducive to the creation and capture of knowledge in the organization . Therefore , as a way of letting this research more clear and concise at the same time with the conceptual / theoretical part , the following subsections advances come theoretical assumptions and used the selected cases to discuss them . Social Media as an enhancer of the focus of attention and a mechanism for the creation , storage , dissemination and application of knowledge in the organization According to Ramos and Levine ( 2012 ) , the way that organizations provide and distribute the necessary attention to its employees helps organizations achieve maximum performance possible and with that , meet the objectives and strategies of the organization . When using Social Media , organizations access to new ways , mechanisms and strategies for individuals to direct their attention to the information necessary to assist them in decision making . This attention is better focused when the professionals feel engaged and involved in activities ( T01 ) and more than just directing their attention to the activities being performed they also tune and involve other professionals in a active and integrated communication effort ( T07 ) , thus becoming more effective in the sharing of ideas and experiences across the organizational setting required to effective decision - making . In this way , the organization can not only perform better the usual activities but becomes more effective in developing new solutions and experiences ( T02 , T12 ) ; For example , by producing descriptions of decisions that are independent of a specific industry or position in the organization , therefore making them easier to reuse in other situations in the organization ( T04 , T05 ) ; in recognition of the organization ' s members for their decision taken through comments , compliments and suggestions ( T06 , T09 ) ; and in a greater confidence of the organization ' s members for their actions and decisions taken ( T01 , T07 ) . Social Media as an effective facilitator mechanisms for organizational communication and for guiding attention to the environmental aspects regarded as relevant for the success of organization Beyond the strategies and actions that stimulate the focus of attention in organizations , it is important to understand the environment and context that situate this attention . Attention is always situated and understanding the local influences on attention is essential to be able to create the circumstances for effective decision - making . To provide an effective transmission of knowledge in the organization , a set of rules and factors in the organization must be directly aligned to an open and collaborative movement provided by Social Media ( T10 ) . To achieve this movement , the knowledge generated can be transmitted throughout the organization and can be reused in order to bring better benefits to both the individual and the organization itself . Thus , content transformations , suggestions , comments created by Social Media can be used as knowledge to the organization itself ( T12 ) ; to the generation of behavioral changes as much external as internal organization ( T10 ) ; to information sharing and exchange of experiences , regardless of hierarchical position of the organization ( T03 ) ; to even on its offer of targeted and specialized services to the needs of Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 9 its customers ( T02 , T14 ) . All this makes it clear that the stimuli generated by the organization associated with the Social Media allow connecting people and sharing experiences , ideas and practices throughout the organization , facilitating the perception and collective action needed to solve problems , make decisions and take advantage of opportunities . Social Media as effective mechanisms of institutionalization of experiences and meanings in stable structures that the effective distribution of attention in the organization Given the support to collaboration that Social Media typically provide by enabling integrated communication and sharing of content , the attention of individuals in the organization can be extended and guided to encompass a wider variety of possibilities as well as of communication and knowledge sharing alternatives within organizational values and strategies . Improved organizational flexibility requires changing the structures of attention ( T11 ) ; extend the scope , the depth and variety of use of Social Media by individuals of this organization ( T10 ) ; integrate and embed Social Media into organizational processes using them on a daily basis the organization ( T13 ) ; generate greater breadth of issues and solutions to decision - makers ( T07 , T08 , 3q09 ) ; reduce communication barriers ( T05 ) ; flatten hierarchies ( T04 , T05 ) or even change hierarchical responsibility in the organization ( T01 , T14 ) . With the Social Media integrated , the organization can direct the attention of individuals effectively by the organization ; further stimulate the use of Social Media ; ensure the involvement of all members of the organization or sector - independent hierarchical level ( T04 ) ; and consolidating independent business units ( T12 , T13 ) . All this to allow a common environment of sharing experiences , decisions and activities held in the organization ; ensure better dissemination and access of information ( T07 ) ; and to generate an effective flow of knowledge in the organization . Social Media as favoring the situation and structured distribution of attention in developing effective organizational memory To provide an organizational environment conducive to interaction and the sharing of knowledge , it is necessary that the focus , the situation and the distribution of attention of individuals are aligned with the mechanisms , strategies and procedures of the organization . This alignment will provide a collaborative environment making the whole process of creation , storage , and dissemination of knowledge in the organization increasingly effective over time . Therefore , the experience gained in a particular environment / sector / organization unit becomes part of the organizational memory in order to be used by other sectors and units of the organization , increasing and making organizational learning more effective ( T07 ) . Once this knowledge is made available through channels of communication – in particular , the Social Media – , and distributed to all members of the organization , there is the possibility of using this accumulated knowledge to draw new strategies and solutions to long time perceived problems ( T12 ) . This accumulated knowledge is the ground over which new knowledge is then generated ( T10 ) , that will guide new actions and decisions to be taken by the organization ( T08 ) . All this knowledge being created , stored and disseminated over time in the organization ensures improved organizational performance by empower individuals building new sources of knowledge relevant to face new challenges ( T07 ) , and to be used to inform innovative actions and decisions . Conclusion This paper examined how Social Media can be used to guide the focus , the context and the distribution of attention in the organization in order to promote the creation , storage , dissemination and application of knowledge in the organization . For this , an analysis was made of 22 selected case studies in the literature that examine the use of Social Media in organizations . These case studies were studied from the theoretical lens provided by the Attention - Based view of the Firm . Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 10 The case analysis reported in this paper shows that Social Media can play an important role in guiding the attention of organizational actors to the aspects they feel relevant and also highlighting unexpected issues that would pass unnoticed . The first contribution of this study is to provide an initial view of cases in the literature that address the use of Social Media in organizations , in particular regarding specific insights on the role Social Media play in guiding the attention of decision - makers and for the effective development of organizational memory . The second contribution of this study was to list a few theoretical assumptions generated from the results of this analysis of Social Media with the central concepts of this investigation that serve to list a few deep points of analysis that can be explored and studied in further work in order to explore how this relationship between theory and practice allow bring benefits to the area of knowledge in studying the case , the information systems . In order to understand the role of Social Media in the construction of the organizational memory , it is not enough to use secondary sources of evidence like case studies performed by other researchers doing research with different goals . However , despite this limitation , the exploratory nature of the analysis already provided the evidence for this role and for the value of the ABV theory as the research lens . This study comes as a starting point to show the need to identify the main challenges that organizations may face decisions that they should take , while the adoption and use of Social Media as a new channel of communication in the organization . Several other theories are related to this process of trajectory of knowledge and organizational memory . We want , in future work , present other theories , analyses them and relates them with the organizational memory and relate the importance of these concepts and procedures in the organizational context .

Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 20 Appendix A . Positive actions applied or expected with implantation and use of the Social Media in organizations cited in case studies selected . ID . POSITIVE ACTIONS ANALYZED – APPLIED OR EXPECTED – WITH IMPLANTATION AND USE OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA IN ORGANIZATIONS ATTENTION FOCUS T01 Provide a confidence feeling among other members of the organizations assuring a higher involvement with all members of the organizations “ [ … ] social media are more effective in addressing the three knowledge - sharing challenges revealed in behavioral research : ( a ) they help increase employees ′ awareness of each other’s expertise and personal interests ; ( b ) they can motivate contribution through frequent , timely feedback and through soliciting reciprocal exchange ; and ( c ) they can better support the development and maintenance of social capital . ” ( Yuan et al . 2013 , p . 1667 ) . “While access to technical support and training will assist with developing members’ skills , capabilities and confidence , a critical success factor appears to be the need for someone within Parent Support to ‘champion’ social media developments , that is , to mobilize the chain of resources . In both organizations , having someone to oversee planning and provide a sense of continuity amid frequent turnover of volunteers and staff will greatly improve the chances of achieving improved communication through social media . ” ( Zorn et al . 2013 , p . 685 ) . T02 Change the view of each organization’s member as to share of information , influencing directly on behavior , attention and involvement of the individual in the organization “One important reason why I am motivated to share on social media is that I could increase my visibility in the organization by interacting with others on the platform . For example , some worldwide colleagues who I don’t work with can recognize me by following my blog . ” ( Yuan et al . 2013 , p . 1665 ) . “There are a growing number of domain experts , project managers and community leaders who have been using blogs and wikis to position themselves as an active voice in the organization , across regions and functions . As stated by one of the users ( a team leader ) , we have ‘a very active blogosphere . . . some teams are spread all over the world and use wikis to work collaboratively’ . ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 117 ) . T03 Motivate and stimulate the initiative by own members in sharing information and making decisions in the organization individually / collectively “Hence , this kind of low - level communication strengthens the aspect of sociability that is important for collaborative work such as co - creation and contributes to knowledge sharing without the need to be involved in long - lasting conversations . ” ( Hauptmann and Steger 2013 , p . 38 ) . “ [ . . . ] a recent on - going discussion on the intranet has focused on organizational restructuring , with messages from senior management , project leaders and employees , all of whom are interested in voicing their concerns and suggestions . ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 117 ) . “ [ … ] more than half of internal social media users interviewed think the increased social capital associated with social media use increases their motivation for sharing expertise with one another . ” ( Yuan et al . 2013 , p . 1664 ) . T04 Become herself / himself available and open to transmit details of the rationale process behind each decision in the organization in order to re - use that knowledge in the organization . “By examining screenshots ( for anonymity they are omitted from this paper ) , it became evident that some of the senior managers have used their blogs to outline the rationale behind some of their decisions ( for instance , to enter a new market in South America or the selection of a new venturing partner ) . ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 117 ) . “Blogs can help to focus an individual’s own thinking about his / her work , providing an additional tool for reflective practice . In addition to the individual focus , publishing this thinking on a blog makes one’s thinking easier to share and can lend itself to creating a small ‘community of practice’ if others comment on the author’s posts [ . . . ] ” ( Denskus and Papan 2013 , p . 458 ) . Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 21 SITUATION OF THE ATTENTION T05 Provide the share of ideas , information and experiences among the members freely and with no barriers , no great interventions , no hierarchy or sectorization , so that to generate an environment suitable for discussion of the problems and concerns in the organization , for the exchange of information in order to suggest solutions and propose innovation . “All news stories can be commented upon and rated . There’s no censoring at all . People are very happy to comment and have very candid comments , which is very good . ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 117 ) . “Encouraging open and free participation with little or no intervention has become an important governance principle ; one that has been gradually established and accepted by organizational members , many of whom are actively engaged in rhetorical practices . ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 117 ) . T06 Ensure the position of the professional as active voice in the organization , in all sectors and funtions , providing higher valorization of this professional in the organization . “One important reason why I am motivated to share on social media is that I could increase my visibility in the organization by interacting with others on the platform . For example , some worldwide colleagues who I don’t work with can recognize me by following my blog . ” ( Yuan et al . 2013 , p . 1665 ) . “Because I blog about the issues that I’m thinking about and dealing with in the course of my everyday job , I’m able to gain a wide spectrum of input and perspective on those issues , whether via comments on my posts , posts on other blogs that ‘riff’ off of mine , or – again – twitter conversations spun off of those same blog posts [ . . . ] ” ( Denskus and Papan 2013 , p . 458 ) . T07 Provide improvements in communication and share of information both in the external and the internal environment to organization , so that to provide greater information global reach and to stimulate interactivity among the organization’s individuals . “The CIO and CMO jointly are accountable for social media strategy and implementation . Performance evaluations , compensation and incentives are based on mutual performance and deliverance of shared objectives and goals . The social media goals and objectives of marketing are aligned with other organizational social media objectives through IT . ” ( Candance Deans 2011 , p . 193 ) . T08 Guarantee the follow up permanent of views , suggestions and comments exposed from responsible professionals in the organization . “Our findings suggest that the use of social media had become part of the social fabric of BX . Blogs , wikis and commenting were no longer a novelty and are accepted as a normal feature of the intranet by employees . Open and participative communication is the default mode of BX’s communication culture , and is representative of a shift in the role of employees from ‘audience’ to active ‘rhetors’ in the organization’s on - line environment . Monitoring feedback and engaging in discussions regarding certain strategies and decisions is now a feature of the day - to - day life of senior management . ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 119 ) . STRUCTURED DISTRIBUTION OF THE ATTENTION T09 Disseminate the organization’s values simply and integrate such values to actions and decisions in the organization . “In this context , DX’s intranet is perceived as the most important medium for internal communication , not just because of its wide reach globally , but also because of its capacity to broadcast a unified voice to communicate and reinforce corporate values and strategy . ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 118 ) . T10 Facilitate better adaptation , whether by training , handbooks and guidelines , in effective use of the technologies adopted by part of the organization in order to make easy the organization’s internal and external communication . “Organizations must provide training and role definition that maintains a balance between autonomy , flexibility , and the identified responsibilities and expectations . ” ( Annabi and McGann 2013 , p . 78 ) . Social Media as organizational memory consolidation mechanism Twenty - first Americas Conference on Information Systems , Puerto Rico , 2015 22 T11 Produce new organizational structures and models considered useful for the making - decision from the permanent follow - up of the views , suggestions , problems and comments exposed by the organization . “From looking at maps that others had generated from Google Maps and posted online the author created a method for displaying the information geographically instead of in a table . ” ( Yates and Paquette 2011 , p . 10 ) . “With wikis in place , CoP leadership will have access to training materials , organizational CoP standards , templates , and best practices in order to be truly prepared and empowered by the organization to lead his or her CoP . Providing this space for CoP leaders to post information on salient issues and building on each other’s experiences and knowledge , is an important step in the continuity of training and role definition for future leaders and members of CoP . ” ( Annabi and McGann 2013 , p . 78 ) . T12 Generate changes in the processes , strategies , routines and culture of the organization so that such changes can lead in effective restructuring , alignment and adequacy of the communication and share of information in the organization . “Specifically , we see a highly vibrant landscape where social media has been incorporated extensively into NX’s organizational communication , and embedded in its day - to - day functioning . ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 118 ) “Social media adoption is less about the tools but rather the strategies and the attitudes of the people and the community driving it . Part of the objective of the BlueBI Campaign is to develop a coherent platform which can be used to nurture a community . ” ( Fernando 2010 , p . 508 ) . “Implementing the guidelines using SM has implications for resource allocation and change in organizational culture . Organizations must allocate the appropriate resources for training and support of these communities . Perhaps most noteworthy is the change in culture required at all levels of the organization . Upper management and its employees must change perceptions of the role of the CoP and their importance to the organization . Striking a balance between alignment with organization structure and strategy as well as the emergent and informal nature of the CoP is also essential . ” ( Annabi and McGann 2013 , p . 79 ) . T13 Strengthering of organizational standards in order to allow an open , bidirectional and interactive communication . “Clear guidelines should be provided to help employees handle the “sticky” aspects of earlier tools . In the absence of such guidelines , employees may go in different directions , which may create more difficulties for knowledge sharing . ” ( Yuan et al . 2013 , p . 1667 ) . “Creating and maintaining norms that promoted engagement seems to have played a significant role in encouraging employees to establish two - way communication in this organization . Interactivity is enabled by a sense of openness of communication that is unconstrained by hierarchy [ . . . ] ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 117 ) . T14 Ensure a positive and functional corporative image , increasing the reputation not only of the organization , but also their employees . “ [ … ] the internal social media platform makes it so easy to share . ” ( Yuan et al . 2013 , p . 1665 ) . “Some of these blogs have received extensive comment from employees , ranging from the positive to the extremely negative . Some request clarification regarding , or even questioning , NX’s strategy moving forward . What is insightful is the amount of effort that the various bloggers spend in responding to comments and concerns . ” ( Huang et al . 2013 , p . 117 ) . View publication stats View publication stats
