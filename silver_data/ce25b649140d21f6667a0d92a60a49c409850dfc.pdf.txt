ABSTRACT The main purposes of Integrin - mediated cell contacts are to interpret bi - directional signals between the extracellular environment and intracellular proteins , as well as , anchor the cell to a matrix . Many cell adhesion molecules have been discovered with a wide spectrum of responsibilities , including recruiting , activating , elongating , and maintaining . This review will perlustrate some of the key incidences that precede focal adhesion formation . Tyrosine phosphorylation is a key signaling initiation event that leads to the recruitment of multiple proteins to focal adhesion sites . Recruitment and concentration of proteins such as Paxillin and Vinculin to Integrin clutches is necessary for focal adhesion development . The assembled networks are responsible for transmitting signals back and forth from the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) to Actin and its binding proteins . Cancer cells exhibit highly altered focal adhesion dynamics . This review will highlight some key discoveries in cancer cell adhesion , as well as , identify current gaps in knowledge . INTRODUCTION During metastasis , cancerous cells have to migrate through the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) for intravasation into blood and lymphatic vessels . The early steps of metastasis involve the coordination of intracellular signals and the microenvironment to allow detachment of the cell from the primary site , and this is first demonstrated by a change in the cells shape . The cells become densely packed and have a reduced amount of protrusions . For stability , cells are linked to the ECM through cell adhesion molecules . In cancer , many cell adhesion molecules participate in this cell - matrix linkage [ 1 ] . Focal adhesions ( FAs ) are large protein complexes that connect the cell cytoskeleton to the ECM through integrins . Integrins are cell adhesion proteins with α and β transmembrane heterodimers that play a major role in converging signals from the cell membrane to the inside of the cell [ 2 ] . The cytosolic portions of both transmembrane heterodimers interact with a number of cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules . These heterodimers act as receptors for ECM proteins including Collagen , Laminin , Thrombospondins , Vitronectin and Fibronectin [ 3 , 4 ] . The two major roles of integrins are to convey outside - in and inside - out signaling . For inside - out signaling , proteins containing FERM domains , such as Talins and Kindlins , bind to Integrin cytoplasmic tails to trigger conformational changes [ 5 ] . Many FA proteins contain these FERM domains which are discussed later on in this review . The conformational changes triggered by these FERM domains lead to integrin activation . In mature FAs , Integrins are active , erect , and bound to their ligand [ 6 ] . For outside - in signaling , the binding of the active Integrin to their respective immobilized ligand results in the recruitment of more adaptor proteins which results in a strengthened cytoskeleton at the FA [ 7 ] . Whilst bound to the ligands , Integrins act as force sensors and force transmitters [ 8 , 9 ] . The ECM can exert forces on Integrins that transfer to the Integrin - associated FA proteins and expose new binding sites for further intramolecular interactions [ 9 ] . Furthermore , cells also respond to this altered tension by inducing changes in gene transcription [ 10 ] . Oppositely , the cytoskeleton of the FA generates forces that allow the Integrins to pull ECM proteins [ 11 ] . The ability of Integrins to connect to the cytoskeleton and transmit forces speaks to its critical role in FA turnover . Because of this , tumor cell migration and invasion rely on Integrin activation / deactivation , as well as , their crosstalk www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget / Oncotarget , 2017 , Vol . 8 , ( No . 29 ) , pp : 48471 - 48487 Review Oncotarget 48472 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget with oncogenes . Integrin signaling is a well orchestrated but complicated phenomenon . Understanding the protein networks that regulate Integrin activation will give us a better understanding of how cells regulate their adhesion . Cell - matrix adhesion sites were first observed more than 40 years ago in chick heart fibroblasts by electron microscopy and interference reflexion microscopy [ 12 – 14 ] . These contacts were first identified to be 2 - 10 μm long , and 0 . 25 - 0 . 5 μm wide [ 14 ] . Since then , studies have found that FA size ranges from 0 . 25 to 10 μm , depending on cell mobility [ 15 ] . For example , rapidly moving cells such as Dictyostelium discoidem cells display small FAs [ 16 ] , while cells with prominent FAs move slower [ 17 , 18 ] . Intracellularly , FA proteins participate in a number of cell signaling pathways . Tyrosine phosphorylation is a key signaling event that leads to the recruitment of multiple proteins to FAs [ 19 ] . Although the kinases ILK , PAK , Abl , Csk , PYK2 and PKC are present in FAs [ 12 ] , Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ) and Src are the most dominant kinases in FA signaling [ 20 ] . Tyrosine phosphorylation by these kinases leads to a recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins , such as Paxillin [ 21 ] , small GTPases , tyrosine phosphatases and other enzymes . Cancer cells participate in different types of directed cell migration including : chemotaxis ( chemoattractant gradient ) , haptotaxis ( environmental gradient ) , electrotaxis ( electrical attractant ) , and durotaxis ( rigidity attractant ) [ 22 ] . Environmental sensing by the cancer cells allows them to interpret various signals that are mediated by FAs . ECM generated stiffness induces and cooperates with cell - matrix forces applied by cells [ 23 ] . Cells are capable of sensing many characteristics of the ECM such as rigidity and anisotropy [ 7 ] . In fact , ECM composition is a key contributor of patient survival [ 24 ] . It has been shown that Collagen fibers straighten as the breast tumor progresses [ 25 ] . Detection of ECM rigidity by Integrins through Myosin II leads to downstream signaling cascades through FAs [ 26 ] . For example , the FAK / Paxillin / Vinculin signaling pathway transmits force information to allow the cell to migrate in different ECM rigidities [ 27 ] . In fact , a study showed that Null - FAK cells are unable to detect changes in ECM rigidity [ 28 ] . Most FA proteins contain multiple binding sites for other proteins ; therefore supramolecular structures tend to form within these sites . The regulation of these protein - protein interactions plays a key role in the development and turnover of adhesion sites . Since it has been shown that the size and composition of the FA contributes to cellular functions such as migration and mechanosensing [ 29 ] , it is important to study the different components of FA complexes . This review will describe some of the key proteins involved in FA signaling . INITIATION OF FA ASSEMBLY Mature FAs are dependent on Actin filament assembly at the leading edge , also referred to as Actin flow [ 30 ] . In order for this to happen , a number of proteins have to be recruited to the site . Tyrosine phosphorylation is a key signaling event that leads to the recruitment of multiple proteins to FAs [ 19 ] . Although not as common , serine phosphorylation also plays an important role in adhesion formation . Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ) and Src are the most dominant kinases in FA signaling [ 20 ] . Other kinases have been shown to participate in this labyrinthine signaling pathway , but inactivation of FAK and Src averts FA assembly . Therefore , it is important to understand the importance of FAK in FA assembly . FAK and Src FAK , a non - receptor tyrosine kinase , is the central regulator of Integrin - mediated FA assembly . FAK was first found to be activated by the ECM or growth factors and its tyrosine phosphorylation is associated with the formation and turnover of FAs [ 31 ] . In fact , Null - FAK fibroblasts exhibit an abundance of FAs [ 32 ] . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased FAK expression in highly malignant human breast and colon cancers [ 33 ] . Since FAK is both a signaling kinase and an adaptor / scaffold protein , it is involved in various signaling pathways including those that contribute to cell migration and angiogenesis [ 34 , 35 ] . In the past ten years , the molecular mechanisms of FAK regulation has been uncovered in detail . The N - terminus of FAK contains a FERM ( Four - point - one , Ezrin , Radixin , Moesin ) domain that is important for protein : phosphoinositide and protein : protein interactions [ 36 , 37 ] . The C - terminus contains a four - helix bundle FAT ( Focal Adhesion Targeting ) domain that is critical for FAKs targeting to FAs through the protein Paxillin [ 38 ] . These FERM and FAT domains are the dominant protein : protein binding domains of FAK [ 39 ] . For example , Met interacts with the FERM domain to promote hepatocyte growth factor - mediated cell invasion [ 40 ] . The FERM domain also interacts with the FAK kinase domain to block the active site from accessing ATP and other substrate binding sites for activation [ 38 , 41 ] . Mutation of the FERM domain at K38 interrupts the FERM : kinase domain interaction and leads to FAK activation [ 42 ] . In summary , the self - inactivation of FAK consists of the FERM domain directly interacting with the kinase domain . Posttranslational modifications are the major regulatory activators for FAK , mainly phosphorylation . The major autophosphorylation site during FA signaling is Tyr397 [ 34 , 43 ] . Phosphorylation at this site establishes a motif that is recognized by proteins containing SH2 domains , including Src kinase [ 44 ] . Many proteins have been identified that contribute to FAK phosphorylation . Multiple factors , including increased p130RhoGEF expression , contribute to the localization of FAK to the elicited adhesion site [ 45 ] . In fact , a mutation in the Oncotarget 48473 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of p130RhoGEF inhibits FA assembly [ 45 ] . As stated earlier , FAK may be activated by growth factors . Of those growth factors , platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) treatment of cells increases autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 [ 46 ] . Also , PDGF stimulation of the cells induced Akt - mediated phosphorylation of FAK at Ser695 and Thr700 to enhance Integrin signaling [ 46 ] . In the early stages of adhesion development , FAK responds to increased Integrin clustering due to ECM rigidity by autophosphoylation at tyrosine 397 and subsequent activation [ 47 – 50 ] . This autophosphorylation site creates a motif that allows recognition of proteins with SH2 domains , such as the p85 subunit of PI3K , Phospholipase Cγ ( PLCγ ) and the SRC - Family Kinases ( SFKs ) [ 34 ] . Even though this autophosphorylation is an indispensable event for FA signaling , FAK is phosphorylated at other sites as well . The oncogene Migration and invasion enhancer 1 ( MIEN1 ) regulates cell migration by inducing phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr - 925 [ 51 ] . MIEN1 is located in the chromosomal region 17q12 - 21 and is typically amplified along with its neighboring gene ERBB2 in breast cancer [ 52 ] . Its many functions include regulating Actin cytoskeletal dynamics and influencing expression of ECM - degrading proteases and angiogenic factors [ 51 , 53 ] . Down regulation of MIEN1 leads to a reduction in FAK phosphorylation at Tyr - 925 , as well as reduced phosphorylation of Akt , Erk1 / 2 and NF - κB [ 51 ] . Analysis of FAK activation is of paramount importance to any FA signaling study . Many FAK - activating proteins have been characterized , including p130RhoGEF [ 45 ] , PDGF [ 46 ] and MIEN1 [ 51 ] , however , the complexity of this signaling pathway suggests that multiple other factors are waiting to be discovered . FAK autophosphorylation also leads to the activation of the tyrosine kinase Src [ 54 ] . As discussed earlier , PDGF is a growth factor that activates FAK . Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) is another growth factor that activates FAK , as well as Src [ 55 ] . Src tyrosine kinase works alongside with active FAK to facilitate the phosphorylation of many FAK - associated proteins . Src - family kinases are essential for the formation and maturation of FAs and are highly activated in many human cancers [ 56 , 57 ] . Genomic amplifications and activating mutations of Src are rare in human cancers so this hyperactivation is often induced by upstream phosphatases or kinases [ 57 ] . Src has several functional domains , including , a 14 - carbon myristic acid moiety attached to a SH4 domain , a SH3 domain followed by an SH2 domain , an SH2 linker , kinase domain and C - terminal regulatory domain . Src is capable of interacting with the plasma membrane through its 14 - carbon N - terminal fatty acid moiety [ 57 , 58 ] . After activation , its SH3 domain interacts with Actin filaments to transmit signals from adhesion receptors to cytoskeletal proteins [ 59 ] . Though FAK autophosphorylation engenders Src activation , concurrent signaling events may occur . Although the precise order in which each activating event occurs is unknown , FAK and Src do work in concert to activate other proteins . For example , in response to extracellular Fibronectin , mechanical stretching of the substrate domain of Cas exposes Src - specific phosphorylation sites [ 60 ] , and in order for this Src - mediated phosphorylation to occur , Cas must be bound to FAK [ 61 ] . Src activates various downstream signaling pathways through its interactions with FAK , epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFRs ) , hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( C - Met or HGFR ) , Integrin cell adhesion receptors , G protein - coupled receptors , and other cytoskeleton components [ 62 , 63 ] . Many protein : protein complexes are found at FA sites . It has been shown that recruitment of FA proteins such as Vinculin and Paxillin precedes tyrosine phosphorylation [ 19 ] . This justifies the importance of the localization of the tyrosine kinases FAK and Src to these nascent adhesion sites . These initial phosphorylation events lead to the activation of other kinases and phosphatases while creating a substrate for SH2 - containing proteins . Although the kinases ILK , PAK , Abl , Csk , PYK2 and PKC are present [ 12 ] , Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ) and Src are the most dominant kinases in FA signaling [ 20 ] . The FAK - Src symbiotic relationship leads to the subsequent recruitment of many proteins to FA sites . FAK and Src bind different partners to uniquely regulate FA dynamics . Some studies only choose to assess FAK activation as a determinant of FA function . Other kinases such as ILK , PAK , Abl , Csk , PYK2 and PKC may be excluded in adhesion studies but it is imperative that Src kinase function be gauged , along with FAK . PROTEIN RECRUITMENT Immature FAs are detected under the microscope as “Actin dots” that are rich in Integrins , Paxillin and Vinculin [ 64 ] . Recruitment and concentration of Paxillin and Vinculin to Integrin clutches is necessary for FA development . Though both proteins have unique roles in adhesion signaling , they play a fundamental role in recruiting key proteins to the adhesion interactome . Their ultimate goals are to transmit signals back and forth from the ECM to Actin and its binding proteins . Formation of Actin filament stress fibers precedes FA formation [ 65 ] . Paxillin Activation of the FA scaffold protein , Paxillin , occurs subsequently after kinase recruitment [ 66 ] . The active FAK - Src proteins phosphorylate Paxillin , and Oncotarget 48474 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget various other adhesion molecules [ 67 ] . Localization of active Src and FAK to FAs results in the phosphorylation of Paxillin at tyrosines 31 and 118 as shown in Figure 1 [ 68 ] . Paxillin is an adaptor / scaffolding protein that participates in a number of cell signaling pathways . The C - terminus contains two LIM ( Lin11 , Isl - 1 , Mec - 3 ) domains that are necessary for targeting to FAs [ 69 , 70 ] . These LIM domains are also important for binding to FA regulatory and structural proteins such as Tubulin and Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non - Receptor Type 12 ( PTPN12 ) [ 71 , 72 ] . The N - terminus of Paxillin contains leucine and aspartate rich motifs that are critical for its interaction with FAK , Vinculin , PYK2 and a number of other FA proteins ( Figure 2 ) [ 73 ] . The proline - rich region of Paxillin also binds to Src [ 74 ] . Furthermore , Paxillin contains many serine and threonine phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated by a number of stimulants , including Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 ( RACK1 ) , a Src kinase inhibitor , and the serine / threonine - protein kinase , p21 - activated Kinase ( PAK ) [ 74 ] . In the early stages of FA formation , Paxillin experiences phosphorylation of tyrosine 118 , and serines 85 , 188 and 190 [ 75 , 76 ] . Paxillin is one of the first proteins present in nascent adhesions and recruits many structural and regulatory proteins to the cell adhesion site [ 74 , 77 ] . Since Paxillin has many direct binding partners , understanding the orchestration of signaling events will help to fathom the specificity Paxillin holds for each dynamic process . This makes Paxillin an attractive target for anti - metastatic drugs since its inhibition prevents the formation of FAs . Vinculin Vinculin is an F - Actin - binding protein that also appears in the early stages of adhesion formation [ 78 ] . Paxillin , F - actin and Talin are necessary for Vinculin recruitment to FA sites [ 78 – 82 ] . Vinculin is a direct binding partner of Paxillin and its interaction is important for coordinating force - induced signals ( Figure 2 ) [ 27 , 83 ] . Vinculin deficient cells are less stiff than normal cells and have lower traction forces due to a reduction in Vinculin’s tension sensing capabilities [ 84 , 85 ] . Vinculin is a tension sensor that is recruited to the FA site in response to mechanical forces by conveying signals from the ECM to Actin filaments [ 86 ] . In addition to its role in mechanosensing , Vinculin directly interacts with a number of proteins that are important for Actin cytoskeletal dynamics . The α - helical Vinculin tail directly binds to Actin ( Figure 2 ) [ 81 , 87 ] . Immediately after binding , Vinculin dimerizes and begins to assemble bundles of Actin filaments [ 87 , 88 ] . The polymerization of these filaments occurs by Vinculin - mediated recruitment of G - Actin to form a nucleus for polymerization [ 81 ] . Vinculin then recruits and directly binds to the Arp2 / 3 Actin polymerization complex [ 89 ] . Also , Vinculin directly interacts with molecules such as the membrane phospholipid , PIP2 , and the cytoskeletal adaptor protein , Vinexin to increase FA size during the elongation phase of FA assembly [ 90 , 91 ] . These interactions are necessary for Actin polymerization to occur . Vinculin and Talin interactions are necessary for strong Integrin - cytoskeleton bonds . Vinculin knockdown Figure 1 : Protein recruitment to future FA site . ( A ) Detached FAs typically have inactivated Integrins , as well as inactive FAK and Src kinases . ( B ) FAK phosphorylation at Y397 leads to the activation of Src . In the early events of FA formation , localization of Src and FAK to FA sites results in Paxillin phosphorylation at tyrosines 118 and 31 . Oncotarget 48475 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget in cells increases cell migration due to increased Paxillin and FAK phosphorylation , as well as , an increase in FA turnover [ 92 , 93 ] . Vinculin has recently been discovered in prostate cancer exosomes [ 94 ] . Though there is a gap in knowledge about why Vinculin is present in exosomes , these secreted micro vesicles may be isolated from the serum of patients and identification of Vinculin could serve as another prognostic marker . Vinculin is an indirect target of the common arthritis drug , Celecoxib . Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug that inhibits cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) [ 95 ] . This inhibitor was first published as a chemopreventative agent in colon carcinogenesis in 1998 , just shortly after its synthesis [ 96 ] . Since then , the tumor preventative effects of Celecoxib have been seen in many other cancer models , including urinary bladder cancer [ 97 ] , prostate cancers [ 98 , 99 ] , and breast cancer [ 100 ] . Recently , Celecoxib has been shown to exert anti - gastric cancer effects by down regulating the expression of 8 genes , including Vinculin [ 101 ] . The other 7 genes , Cysteine and glycine - rich protein 1 ( CRP1 ) [ 102 ] , Thrombospondin 1 ( THBS1 ) [ 103 ] , Myosin light chain 9 ( MYL9 ) [ 104 ] , Filamin A ( FLNA ) [ 105 ] , Actinin alpha 1 ( ACTN1 ) [ 106 ] , Laminin subunit gamma 2 ( LAMC2 ) [ 107 ] and Claudin 1 ( CLDN1 ) [ 108 ] are also linked to cell adhesion . These research findings suggest that Celecoxib exerts its anti - cancer functions by down regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules . This further stresses the importance of studying FAs and the therapeutic potential that could be obtained from those studies . ACTIN ASSEMBLY Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells . Polymerization of Actin into microfilaments is required for a sturdy cell - matrix adhesion point . This assembly requires three phases : a nucleation , elongation and steady state phase . During nucleation , Actin monomers are converted to stable multimers . These multimers are then rapidly elongated by adding monomers to both ends . Finally , the steady state phase is achieved once equilibrium is reached between the polymerization at one end and the disassembly at the opposite as shown in Figure 3 . This three - step process requires many proteins but we will focus on the three most studied assembly pathways that include the Arp2 / 3 complex , the Ena / VASP family , Formins and Talin . Arp2 / 3 complex Actin nucleation is the mechanism by which Actin monomers form into a stable multimer . Actin Related Protein 2 ( Arp2 ) and Actin Related Protein 3 ( Arp3 ) were the first Actin nucleators to be discovered [ 109 ] . These two proteins form a complex known as the Arp2 / 3 complex . For activation , this complex relies on nucleation promoting factors such as Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) and WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) [ 110 , 111 ] . Cortactin has also been shown to cooperate with N - WASP to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 112 , 113 ] . The precise mechanism that the Arp2 / 3 complex uses for Actin nucleation is heavily debated [ 109 – 111 ] . For example , one study showed that the Actin binding protein Caldesmon increases Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching activity by promoting the binding of newly polymerized Actin to the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 114 ] . Another study showed that accelerated release of WASP proteins from the Actin - Arp2 / 3 complex accelerated branch forming [ 115 ] , suggesting that WASP dissociates from the Actin - Arp2 / 3 complex prior to Actin filament growth . Cells with HER2 gene amplification have increased co - expression of both WAVE2 and Arp2 / 3 [ 116 ] . This is Figure 2 : Vinculin and Paxillin binding . Vinculin is a direct binding partner of Paxillin , Talin , Arp2 / 3 , Actin and the Ena / VASP proteins . Paxillin binds to PYK2 , Integrin , Src , Tubulin and PTPN12 . The LIM2 and LIM3 domains of Paxillin are necessary for FA targeting . Oncotarget 48476 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget of great significance because HER2 gene amplification is a poor prognostic indicator in early breast cancer . Furthermore , HER2 status plays a role in selecting the most effective treatment option for both early and advanced breast cancer . The reason why there is co - amplification of these genes is unclear , especially since the genes are all located on different chromosomes . Arp2 / 3 mRNA and protein expression are often upregulated in some other invasive cancer cells as well , including colorectal and lung adenocarcinoma’s [ 117 – 119 ] . Though these other invasive cancers are not associated with frequent HER2 amplification , its co - amplification patterns in breast cancer need to be further explored . Two highly effective small molecule inhibitors , CK - 666 and CK - 869 bind the Arp 2 / 3 complex and reversibly inhibit Actin nucleation [ 120 ] . Both molecules have distinct binding sites with CK - 666 blocking the movement of the complex proteins to their activated conformation [ 121 ] . CK - 666 treatment of the human ovarian carcinoma cell line , A2780 , resulted in a collapse of lamellipodia [ 122 ] , while treatment of fibroblasts with CK - 869 caused blebbing [ 123 ] . CK - 636 is a similar inhibitor that has a thiopene rather than the fluorobenzene ring of CK - 666 but has a much lower IC 50 [ 120 ] . CK - 869 alternatively binds to an off - hand cavity on Arp 3 that destabilizes its interaction with Arp 2 [ 121 ] . Its analog , CK - 548 , has ortho - hydroxy and meta - chlorine substituent’s where CK - 869 has methoxy groups in the ortho and para positions [ 120 ] . CK - 869 is acknowledged as the more effective inhibitor because a study showed that CK - 548 does not effectively inhibit comet tail formation by Listeria [ 120 ] . CK - 869 inhibition in the MCF10A mammary gland cell line disrupted lamellipodia formation and cell spreading [ 124 ] . The ability of Arp complex inhibitors to prevent cell adhesion speaks to the importance of adhesion assembly . Figure 3 : The three stages of filament assembly . Actin filament assembly requires three stages : a nucleation , elongation and steady state phase . ( A ) During nucleation , the Actin monomers are converted to stable multimers through nucleating proteins such as Arp2 / 3 . ( B ) During elongation , monomers are rapidly added to each end . ( C ) During the steady state phase , WAVE and Ena / VASP interact to enhance Arp2 / 3 filament assembly . Oncotarget 48477 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Although the disruption of lamellipodia upon treatment with Actin nucleation inhibitors is universal , several studies have found no disruption of monolayer integrity or cytotoxicity of normal epithelial cells [ 124 , 125 ] . Given that treatment of cells with these compounds prevents Actin branched networks , these inhibitors could serve as effective cancer therapeutics . Recruitment of key FA proteins such as FAK and Paxillin to FA sites is important but if assembly of the Actin filament is perturbed , FAs will not form . Ena / VASP protein family The nucleation - promoting factor and Arp2 / 3 activator , WAVE , directly binds to Ena / VASP to enhance Arp2 / 3 filament assembly ( Figure 3 ) [ 126 ] . The Ena / VASP protein family regulates Actin assembly and has been implicated in fibroblast migration , T cell polarization and axon guidance [ 127 ] . These proteins are targeted to areas of Actin remodeling , such as the leading edges of invadopodia , lamellipodia , filopodia and Actin - dependent cell - cell contacts [ 127 – 129 ] . Actin proteins are non - symmetrical structures with two ends , each referred to as a “barbed end” and “pointed end” [ 130 ] . Polarized growth of the filament is regulated by proteins that cap their ends to block the assembly of polarized filaments [ 130 ] . Disassembly of the filaments occurs at the pointed end , while elongation occurs at the barbed end [ 130 ] . Ena / VASP regulatory molecules protect Actin filaments from capping proteins at their barbed ends [ 131 , 132 ] . Also , Ena / VASP proteins increase the density of Arp2 / 3 - dependent Actin filament branches during Actin polymerization [ 127 ] . Proteins from this family regulate many cell motility pathways and are associated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients [ 133 , 134 ] . Ena / VASP proteins are uniquely linked to Profilin - 1 ( Pfn1 ) , a G - Actin binding protein that is down regulated in breast , hepatic and pancreatic adenocarcinomas [ 135 – 137 ] . In breast cancer , down regulation of Pfn1 in MDA - MB - 231 cells leads to a highly motile phenotype that was orchestrated by Ena / VASP proteins [ 138 ] . In fact , silencing of Pfn1 in these cells enhanced the localization of VASP to their leading edge to enhance cell motility [ 138 ] . The targeting of Ena / VASP proteins to the leading edge and subsequent enhanced motility hints to its importance for adhesion dynamics in cancer cells . Formins Like Ena / VASP proteins , the Formin protein family is responsible for the formation of unbranched Actin filaments . The Formin family consists of fifteen genes that play a role in many cellular processes , including cell adhesion , migration , stress fiber formation , and development [ 139 ] . Formins are defined by their highly conserved C - terminal Formin homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain , which nucleates Actin monomers [ 140 ] . The N - terminus contains a FH1 domain that recruits Profilin - Actin monomers to grow the filament [ 141 ] . FHOD1 is a Formin that is necessary for cell spreading , adhesion maturation , and the transduction of adhesive force [ 142 ] . It is the major Formin transcriptionally upregulated during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) of oral squamous carcinoma cells ( OSCC ) [ 143 ] . EMT is a process by which non - motile epithelial cells gain an invasive , mesenchymal phenotype [ 144 ] . Knockdown of FHOD1 results in the repression of elongation , migration and invasion of SCC - 43B OSCCs [ 143 ] . As a cell undergoes the EMT , it experiences an increase in Actin organization , motility and invasiveness mainly due to an increase in the expression of mesenchymal markers . The up - regulation of FHOD1 during this process suggests that it is a mesenchymal marker . This new fibroblast - like morphology has to have dynamic Actin assembly / disassembly capabilities . Arp2 / 3 , Ena / VASP and Formins are crucial for Actin nucleation but require proteins like Talin to enhance the length of the FA . Talin Talin is a critical component of cell contacts and the primary determinant of FA length [ 145 ] . Talin binds to many adhesion proteins , including Actin , FAK , Vinculin , and Integrins to enhance the strength of FAs [ 146 – 149 ] . Talin acts as a linker between Actin and Integrins to allow the transmission of biochemical signals and force across the cell membrane [ 150 , 151 ] . Specifically , the interaction between Talin and β - Integrin triggers a conformational change in the Integrin extracellular domain that promotes a stronger affinity to the ECM [ 152 ] . Talin binding to β Integrins through its FERM domain is what induces this conformational change in Integrins that promotes its affinity for the ECM [ 153 , 154 ] . Not only is Talin’s role as a linker important for strong adhesions , but its role as an Integrin activator is significant as well [ 155 ] . In fact , downregulation of Talin leads to aberrant folding and processing of Integrins [ 156 ] . Talin overexpression is generally correlated with poor prognosis and this overexpression has been noted in triple negative breast cancers , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , and human hepatocellular carcinomas [ 157 – 159 ] . Interestingly , Talin 1 has been shown to have an opposite effect in prostate cancer because it impairs cell adhesion and motility [ 160 ] . Actin assembly is important for anchoring the cell , but the turnover of the FAs is essential to cell migration and invasion . Actin filament disassembly is required for cell spreading and migration of cells . A key indicator of FA Oncotarget 48478 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget turnover is proteolysis of Integrins , FAK and Talin [ 161 – 163 ] . RhoGTPases promote FA turnover through FAK - mediated suppression [ 164 ] . Although much is known about Actin assembly in cancer , the opposite is evident for Actin disassembly . However , it is known that filaments grow until they are capped by proteins , such as those from the Ena / VASP family [ 165 ] . Extracellular cues , including substrate tension information instructs Actin assembly machinery on how long the particular FA should be . In the absence of such external signals , it is unknown which intrinsic signals regulate Actin assembly . THE CANCER CELLULAR ADHESOME In recent years , novel proteins have been linked to FA regulation in cancer cells . Using proteomic analysis , a 2 , 413 - protein Integrin adhesion complex has been identified [ 166 ] . These proteins are grouped into four axes of core adhesion machinery comprising the FAK - Paxillin , Talin - Vinculin , α - Actinin - Zyxin - VASP , and ILK - PINCH - Kindlin pathways [ 166 ] . The FAK - Paxillin , Talin - Vinculin , and α - Actinin - Zyxin - VASP have been well studied in cancer cells but not all constituents in the pathways have been discovered . Alterations in gene expression of these FA molecules can either lead to a change in the size of each cell - matrix contact , or cell death . Targeting of FA proteins has been shown to sensitize cancer cells to treatment [ 167 ] . In MCF7 breast cancer cells , knockdown of FAK , Integrin linked kinase ( ILK ) , Talin , and Zyxin leads to enlarged FAs [ 168 ] . Furthermore , Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 12B ( PPP1R12B ) , Homeodomain Interacting Protein Kinase 3 ( HIPK3 ) , Rac2 , and Tropomyosin 1 ( TPM1 ) inhibit Insulin - like Growth Factor 1 Receptor ( IGF1R ) driven migration of MCF7 cells [ 168 ] . These proteins enlarge FAs to anchor the cell to the matrix and reduce the rate of disassembly . Inhibition of the serine / threonine kinase , NEK3 also leads to enlarged FAs in MCF7 breast cancer cells . The NimA related kinase ( NEK ) family is known for controlling cell cycle progression in response to genotoxic stress . NEK3 , in particular , regulates Prolactin - mediated cytoskeletal reorganization in breast cancer cells [ 169 ] . Prolactin signaling also activates NEK3 at threonine 165 [ 170 ] . Inhibition of the NEK3 Thr - 165 phosphorylation results in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and increased FA size [ 170 ] . Overexpression of NEK3 - T165V in cancer cells led to a decrease in migration [ 170 ] . The coordination of adhesion assembly and disassembly is delicately orchestrated . The inhibition of MCF7 cell migration seems to be the consequence of enlarged FAs . This hints to an increase in the rate of Actin assembly and a decrease in the rate of Actin disassembly . Enlarged FAs are not always a consequence of the inhibition of cancer cell migration ; some proteins can inhibit cell migration without enlarging the FAs . Transformation - related protein 63 ( p63 ) is a member of the p63 / p53 / p73 family of transcription factors that also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [ 171 ] . This family of transcription factors contains three highly conserved domains : a transactivating domain , a DNA binding domain , and an oligomerization domain [ 171 ] . Alternative splicing of p63 brings forth two different isoforms : those with or without the full length transactivating domain [ 172 ] . Expression of the truncated isoform ( ΔNp63 ) in basal - A triple - negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) cell lines resulted in a reduction of cell adhesion , which led to cell death [ 173 ] . Opposite effects have been demonstrated in squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus ( ESCC ) . Another group suggested that the amplification of TP63 that leads to the hyper - expression of ΔNp63 seen in ESCC is what promotes cell adhesion [ 174 ] . In fact , inhibition of p63 in the TE13 squamous esophageal carcinoma cell line altered expression of cell adhesion proteins [ 174 ] . P63 has both oncogenic and suppressive capabilities that all eventually lead to a regulation of cell adhesion dynamics . The ΔNp63 isoform in particular seems to control these effects since the full - length protein has not been shown to affect cell adhesion . Though ΔNp63 alters the expression of some of the key FA proteins , the exact mechanism by which it exerts its functions is unknown . Approximately 15 - 20 % of newly described breast cancer cases are triple - negative breast cancers ( TNBCs ) . This subtype is highly invasive and has the greater probability to metastasize . A few pharmacological inhibitors have been developed for reducing TNBC cell adhesion . AMPI - 109 selectively targets TNBC cells by activating pro - apoptotic caspases - 3 and 7 , DNA fragmentation , and PARP cleavage [ 175 ] . Studies performed in BT - 20 TNBC cell lines showed that AMPI - 109 treatment impairs cell migration and invasion by reducing levels of the oncogenic tyrosine phosphatase , PRL - 3 [ 175 ] . Further investigations of this showed that knockdown of PRL - 3 or AMPI - 109 treatment deactivate the Src and ERK signaling pathways , which reduces RhoA and Rac1 / 2 / 3 GTPase protein expression [ 176 ] . On the contrary , PRL - 3 over expression increased adherence to and degradation of TNBC cells to the ECM component Laminin [ 176 ] . In vivo animal models further demonstrate that PRL - 3 inhibition reduces growth of TNBC tumors [ 177 ] . These studies were the first to link PRL - 3 to the FA pathway in TNBC cells . The fact that the effectiveness of the AMPI - 109 is in its ability to disrupt cell adhesion dynamics speaks to the importance of fully understanding all of the components of the FA - signaling pathway . CLOSING REMARKS Adhesion of a cell to the ECM regulates cancer cell morphology , migration , survival , and proliferation . The proteins involved in FA assembly serve as markers for standard Western Blot or Immunofluorescence Oncotarget 48479 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget techniques using lysed or fixed cells ( Figure 4 ) . However , live cell imaging allows us to study FA strength , turnover , and polymerization in real - time . The dynamics of the cytoskeleton near the edge of the cell can be visualized by using total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . To use this , FA proteins are genetically tagged to fluorescent proteins then introduced into cells . Once the imaging has started , only the fluorophores within 100 nm from the bottom of the cell are excited [ 178 ] . This process allows one to visualize the attachment , assembly , and turnover of the FA . A migrating cell often experiences rapid re - organization of its FA sites . Understanding the spatial regulation of each site gives a more detailed picture of cell migration . Major advances to the field of optical Figure 5 : Key proteins are localized to mature FAs . Diverse proteins participate in FA signaling , including tyrosine kinases , phosphatases , G - Actin binding proteins , and GTPases . A mature FA will contain activate Integrins that are bound to their ECM ligand . FA signaling pathways regulate the activation of these Integrins . Figure 4 : Microscopic visualization of FAs . Primary tumor cells isolated from MMTV - PyMT tumors were plated on a Fibronectin - coated cover slip and labeled with Vinculin ( green ) to visualize FAs and DAPI ( blue ) to visualize the nucleus . Phalloidin ( red ) staining is shown in the right panel . Scale bar : 10μm . Oncotarget 48480 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget microscopy now allow the precise visualization of a single fluorescent molecule [ 179 – 181 ] . To supplement these discoveries , efficient algorithms have been developed for single - particle tracking [ 182 ] . Super - resolution microscopy that is based on single molecule localizations includes photoactivation localization microscopy ( PALM ) , stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) , ground state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecular return ( GSDIM ) and universal point accumulation imaging in the nanoscale topography ( uPAINT ) [ 183 , 184 ] . iPALM is a unique form of super - resolution microscopy that combines PALM with simultaneous multi - phase interferometry of photons from individual fluorescent molecules [ 185 ] . This technology allows one to image fluorescence - tagged FA proteins with three - dimensional nanoscale resolution [ 186 ] . This imaging was used by Kanchanawong , et al to determine the three - dimensional localization of many FA proteins including FAK , Paxillin , Talin , Vinculin , and Actin [ 186 ] . Super resolution techniques such as iPALM continue to be useful for defining the molecular architecture of FAs . Some other novel imaging techniques include measuring nanomechanics through atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) [ 187 ] . Time - lapse AFM of live cells permits the observation of the dynamic rearrangements that occur at the cell membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton . AFM allows for the measurement of Young’s ( E ) and shear ( G ) modulus [ 188 ] . Since mechanical tension sensed by Integrins directs the formation of FAs , AFM provides an excellent opportunity to measure cell traction force . The development of more novel imaging techniques would help our understanding of FA dynamics . A cells interaction with its ECM regulates a number of cancer cell processes , including proliferation , migration , survival , and morphology . Specifically , Integrin - mediated adhesion regulates cell signaling , migration and cell contractile force . Alterations in the adhesion mechanics of cells may play a role in the development and progression of cancer . A diverse array of proteins participate in FA signaling , including tyrosine kinases , phosphatases , G - Actin binding proteins , and GTPases as shown in Figure 5 . Significant progress has been made in identifying key proteins involved in adhesion signaling , as well as linking these incidents with oncogenic events . Although many proteins in the FA - signaling pathway have been discovered , many more undiscovered proteins may contribute to this phenomena . Fully understanding the unique mechanisms of Integrin - mediated cell adhesions in different cancer types could provide new diagnostic or prognostic markers . To facilitate this , development of novel high - resolution microscopy / spectroscopy methods could aid the field in understanding the complex molecular interactions that occur at specific FA points .
