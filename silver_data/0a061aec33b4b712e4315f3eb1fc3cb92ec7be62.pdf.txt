Abstract Metastatic invasion of tumors into peripheral tissues is known to rely upon protease - mediated degradation of the surrounding stroma . This remodeling process utilizes complex , actin - based , specializations of the plasma membrane termed invadopodia that act both to sequester and release matrix metalloproteinases . Here we report that cells of mesenchymal origin , including tumor - associated fibroblasts , degrade substantial amounts of surrounding matrix by a mechanism independent of conventional invadopodia . These degradative sites lack the punctate shape of conventional invadopodia to spread along the cell base and are reticular and / or fibrous in character . In marked contrast to invadopodia , this degradation does not require the action of Src kinase , Cdc42 , or Dyn2 . Rather , inhibition of Dyn2 causes a dramatic upregulation of stromal matrix degradation . Further , expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases are differentially regulated between tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts . This matrix remodeling by fibroblasts increases the invasive capacity of tumor cells , thereby illustrating how the tumor microenvironment can contribute to metastasis . These findings provide evidence for a novel matrix remodeling process conducted by stromal fibroblasts that is substantially more effective than conventional invadopodia , distinct in structural organization , and regulated by disparate molecular mechanisms .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Introduction Dissemination of neoplastic cells away from the primary tumor is a characteristic of metastatic invasion and is a primary obstacle to the treatment of cancer . Invasion requires complex , agonist - activated , and actin - based tumor cell migration machinery that works in tandem with the secretion of matrix - remodeling metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . This secretion of matrix - degrading proteases is believed to be largely coordinated by complex organelles termed “invadopodia , ” protrusions of the plasma membrane built upon a core of actin filaments and scores of associated proteins ( 1 ) . Invadopodia assembly and function are regulated by multiple factors , including the signaling activity of Src kinase , the actin remodeling properties of Cdc42 , and the GTPase function of Dynamin 2 ( 2 - 5 ) . The mechanisms by which these structures are regulated , formed , and facilitate protease secretion and activation are critical , as attenuating invadopodia function could reduce tumor dissemination . Importantly , many tumor cells do not form invadopodia in culture , do not degrade the surrounding matrix , and do not themselves secrete proteases , yet are able to disseminate and invade robustly . Many solid tumors , in particular pancreatic tumors , consist predominantly of supportive stromal cells , generating a complex tumor microenvironment ( 6 ) . This population of surrounding stellate cells and / or cancer associated fibroblasts ( CAFs ) may actually provide a significant stromal remodeling capacity to lead the way for invasive tumor cells ( 7 ) . However , the mechanisms of matrix remodeling by stromal cells are not well characterized . Recent studies have implicated the actin regulatory protein palladin in promoting invadopodia formation by CAFs to contribute to tumor cell invasion ( 8 , 9 ) . In addition , stromal degradation can be dramatically upregulated in fibroblasts by expression of oncogenic Src , and this podosome - like degradation requires the GTPase Dynamin 2 ( 4 , 10 ) . However , mechanisms underlying fibroblast - based matrix degradation without ectopic expression of active Src are not well defined , and it is not clear if invadopodia are the primary drivers of matrix remodeling in stromal fibroblasts . To this end , we have compared the matrix - degrading machinery of human cancer cell lines with that of multiple mesenchymal - derived supportive cells , including CAFs , pancreatic stellate cells , and non - cancer associated fibroblasts . While tumor cells largely utilize invadopodial - based degradation , the matrix degradation by stromal cells is markedly different . Stromal cell matrix degradation is tubular / reticular in organization , and is regulated by different molecular machinery than invadopodial degradation by the tumor cells . These findings suggest that neoplastic epithelial cells and supportive stromal cells exhibit differential mechanisms to mediate matrix remodeling . The non - invadopodial degradation by CAFs in the tumor microenvironment could possess a substantial capacity to amplify the invasive properties of the tumor cells . Results Differential requirements for the large GTPase Dynamin in matrix degradation To compare the degradative patterns between epithelial tumor cells and stromally - derived mesenchymal fibroblasts , cells were plated on fluorescent gelatin - coated coverslips and Cao et al .

Cell models included human adenocarcinoma cell lines of pancreatic ( BxPC3 , DanG ) and breast ( MDA - MB - 231 ) origin , and several mesenchymal cell lines including human foreskin fibroblasts , rat and mouse fibroblasts , and three different pancreatic stromal cell lines : CAFs isolated from human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) patient - derived xenografts , and normal pancreatic stellate cells ( PSC - 1 and PSC - 2 ) , which are thought to be a primary source of CAFs in pancreatic cancers ( 12 ) . Epithelial tumor cells degraded the fluorescent substrate in a punctate pattern , representing conventional invadopodia ( Fig . 1a - c ) , and showed substantial colocalization with the invadopodial markers actin and cortactin ( Fig . 1j ) . In contrast , stromal fibroblasts and stellate cells displayed a combination of peripheral filamentous , focal adhesion - like degradation patterns ( 13 , 14 ) and a series of elaborate tubular - reticular networks ( Fig . 1d - g ) , which showed no colocalization with actin or cortactin ( Fig . 1k ) . These data suggest the matrix degradation accomplished by the fibroblasts and PSCs is distinct from the invadopodial matrix degradation of the tumor cells . All cells displayed a wide range of degradative activity as well as variations in the amount of matrix degraded per cell , with 90 % of DanG and 35 % of BxPC3 cells remodeling matrix , compared to just 25 % of the human fibroblasts or < 5 % of the CAFs ( Fig . 1h - i ) . Degradation by all cell types was completely inhibited by the MMP inhibitor BB - 94 , demonstrating that the degradation is protease - dependent ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Interestingly , the area of degradation by the mesenchymal cells was notably higher than the BxPC3 or MDA - MB - 231 tumor cells , which form bona fide invadopodia and are invasive ( Fig . 1i ) . Therefore , this pattern of fibroblast - based matrix degradation is at least as potent as the degradation by tumor cells , if not more so . To test if these different degradative phenotypes represent distinct mechanistic processes by epithelial versus mesenchymal cells , we tested the requirement for the large GTPase dynamin in the capacity to form invadopodia . The ubiquitous form of dynamin ( Dyn2 ) is essential for the formation and function of invadopodia , presumably by mediating structural interactions between the ventral cell membrane and the actin cytoskeleton ( 2 , 10 ) . Indeed , siRNA - mediated knockdown of Dyn2 significantly reduced invadopodia formation and matrix degradation in the adenocarcinoma cell lines ( Fig . 2a - j , x - y ) . In surprising contrast , the reduction of Dyn2 in the stromal cells caused a massive increase in matrix degradation , with a significant enlargement of the tubular - reticular patterns that extend from the cell center to the periphery . Knockdown of Dyn2 in stromal cells induced a 4 - 8 fold increase in the percent of cells degrading the matrix ( Fig . 2l - x ) , as well as a striking 2 - 6 fold increase in the area of matrix degraded per cell ( Fig . 2y ) . To pursue the unexpected finding that fibroblasts degrade more matrix under conditions of low Dyn2 expression , we utilized MEFs from dynamin knockout mice ( 15 ) . These cells have an inducible knockout of Dyn1 and Dyn2 driven by 4 - hydroxy - tamoxifen ( 4HT ) . Similar to the human and rat fibroblasts ( Fig . 2 ) , the parental MEFs ( DKO ) exhibit very low levels of matrix degradation . Strikingly , 4HT - induced knockout of Dyn2 resulted in a massive increase in matrix degradation , with a 6 - fold increase in the percent of cells capable of degrading matrix and a 10 - fold increase in degradation area per cell , and the induction of the Cao et al .

This increase is ablated in the knockout cells re - expressing wild type Dyn2 , but not GTPase defective Dyn2K44A ( Fig . 3d - g ) . Similarly , overexpression of dominant negative Dyn2 K44A in rat fibroblasts induces the same dramatic matrix degradation , whereas expression of Dyn2 K44A in DanG tumor cells suppresses matrix degradation ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Together , these data suggest that in fibroblasts , Dyn2 actually represses matrix degradation in a manner that requires its GTPase activity , a finding that is completely contrary to that observed in the epithelial - based tumor cells and contrary to the role of Dyn2 in the Src - induced , podosome - like degradation structures observed in mesenchymal cells ( 2 , 10 ) . Fibroblast - derived ECM degradation is distinct from invadopodia - based degradation The massive upregulation of matrix degradation by fibroblasts following depletion of Dyn2 does not resemble conventional invadopodia , raising the exciting possibility that these degradative structures are not only morphologically different from those in epithelial cells , but also mechanistically distinct . Invadopodial - based matrix degradation in tumor cells colocalizes with puncta positive for actin and cortactin , components of invadopodia . However , the sites of matrix degradation by the fibroblasts and PSCs showed no colocalization with actin or cortactin ( Fig . 1 , Supplemental Fig . 3 ) . We hypothesized that the reticular degradation pattern actually represented the accumulated degradation of multiple dynamic invadopodia over time . To test this , matrix degradation was imaged at very early timepoints . Stromal cells were depleted of Dyn2 to amplify the nontraditional matrix degradation , then plated on fluorescent gelatin - coated coverslips in the presence of the MMP inhibitor BB - 94 . The BB - 94 was then washed out , and cells were fixed and stained after 0 - 8 hours . Even within 1 - 2 hours , there was no colocalization between actin or cortactin with patterns of matrix degradation ( Supplementary Fig . S3 , Supplementary Movies 1 - 3 ) , suggesting that the degradation is distinct from the canonical actin - based invadopodial machinery . Src kinase activity induces invadopodia formation and maturation , and is required for invadopodial - based matrix degradation in tumor cells ( 4 , 16 ) . Consistent with this model , treatment of tumor cells with the Src inhibitor PP2 severely inhibited matrix degradation ( Fig . 4a - d , i - j ) . We then tested the requirement for Src in fibroblast - based degradation . Using both DKO MEFs and rat fibroblasts , Dyn2 was depleted by tamoxifen treatment or siRNA to promote matrix degradation . The cells were then plated on the fluorescent gelatin substrate in the presence of PP2 or DMSO vehicle control . Surprisingly , PP2 treatment had no inhibitory effect on matrix degradation by fibroblasts , even at short timepoints ( Fig . 4e - j , Supplementary Fig . S4 ) , suggesting that Src activity is not required for this stromal - based matrix degradation . Similar results were observed in control fibroblasts without knockdown of Dyn2 , which degrade matrix by a non - invadopodial mechanism but at a lower frequency ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . These findings further indicate that the degradation by the fibroblasts is mechanistically distinct from invadopodia . The small GTPase Cdc42 is a well - characterized regulator of invadopodia formation ( 3 , 17 , 18 ) . Indeed , expression of dominant negative Cdc42 ( T17N ) inhibited matrix degradation in the DanG tumor cells ( Fig . 4k - l , o - p ) . Therefore , we tested if the large - scale matrix Cao et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t degradation induced in fibroblasts required Cdc42 activity . DKO MEFs were treated with 4HT to induce dynamin knockout , were transfected with dominant negative Cdc42 ( T17N ) , and were plated on the fluorescent gelatin substrate . Strikingly , dominant negative Cdc42 had no effect on matrix degradation in the dynamin - depleted fibroblasts ( Fig . 4m - p ) , while it dramatically inhibited matrix degradation in epithelial tumor cells . These data indicate that the fibroblast - derived matrix degradation is independent of Cdc42 . Thus , taken together , these findings demonstrate that fibroblasts are able to degrade the extracellular matrix by a novel mechanism distinct from invadopodia . This robust , large - scale degradation is independent of the invadopodial master regulators Src and Cdc42 , does not have the typical invadopodial architecture and degradation pattern , and has an opposite requirement for Dyn2 compared to traditional invadopodia , thereby defining a unique mechanism of matrix degradation . The trafficking of metalloproteinases differs in tumor cells versus stromal fibroblasts Thus far , we have demonstrated an intriguing difference in the regulation of matrix degradation in fibroblasts versus epithelial - derived tumor cells . Depletion of Dyn2 in carcinoma cells inhibits invadopodia - based matrix degradation , whereas depletion of Dyn2 in fibroblasts results in a dramatic upregulation of invadopodia - independent matrix degradation . In an attempt to identify the differences underlying the distinct mechanisms of matrix degradation between the two cell types , we assayed for changes in MMP activity . Dyn2 was depleted using siRNA or 4HT - induced knockout in both fibroblasts ( HF , RF , PSC , DKO MEFs ) and epithelial - derived tumor cells ( DanG , BxPC3 , MDA - MB - 231 ) , and culture medium supernatants were analyzed by gelatin zymography . Notably , knockdown of Dyn2 in mesenchymal cells resulted in a significant upregulation of MMP - 2 activity , while total levels of MMP - 2 were not significantly altered ( Fig . 5 a - b ) . In contrast , the epithelial - derived tumor cells had comparatively lower levels of active and total MMP - 2 , as determined by both zymography and immunoblotting , and no increase in MMP - 2 activity was observed in the tumor cells . These data suggest that matrix degradation in epithelial tumors and mesenchymal fibroblasts are accomplished differently , and that fibroblast - mediated degradation may be regulated through MMP - 2 activity , which in turn is modulated by Dyn2 . As total levels of MMP - 2 protein were not significantly altered following Dyn2 knockdown , the data suggest that Dyn2 regulates activation of MMP - 2 . Pro - MMP - 2 is cleaved and activated extracellularly by membrane - tethered MT1 - MMP ( membrane type 1 - matrix metalloproteinase ) , a protease critical to invadopodia function and matrix degradation by tumor cells ( 19 , 20 ) . MT1 - MMP surface retention is regulated by Dyn2 function in endocytosis ( 21 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that MT1 - MMP was differentially regulated by Dyn2 in the fibroblasts and epithelial - derived cell types , thereby selectively activating MMP - 2 and leading to the differential regulation of matrix degradation . To test this , total MT1 - MMP levels were initially assessed by immunoblotting . In mesenchymal cells , knockdown of Dyn2 led to a modest 30 - 50 % increase in total MT1 - MMP levels . In contrast , in epithelial tumor cells , knockdown of Dyn2 led to a modest reduction ( 30 - 50 % ) in total MT1 - MMP ( Fig . 6a - b ) . As reduced levels of Dyn2 could restrict the endocytic internalization of the MT1 protease from invadopodia at the cell surface , leading to Cao et al . Page 5 Oncogene .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t increased matrix degradation , we next tested if the changes in total cellular levels of MT1 translated to altered protease levels at the plasma membrane . Immunofluorescence was used to probe for MT1 - MMP on non - permeabilized cells , thereby detecting only MT1 - MMP on the cell surface . In mesenchymal cells , there was a striking ( 2 - 3 . 5 fold ) increase in surface MT1 - MMP following depletion of Dyn2 ( Fig . 6c - g ) . In contrast , in the epithelial - derived tumor cells , knockdown of Dyn2 caused no increase , or induced a modest reduction of MT1 - MMP on the cell surface . MT1 - MMP is a major regulator of matrix remodeling , as MT1 - MMP colocalized with sites of matrix degradation by both tumor cells and fibroblasts ( Fig . 6h - i ) . However , these data suggest that MT1 - MMP expression and trafficking are differentially regulated by Dyn2 in different cell types , with Dyn2 positively regulating or not affecting MT1 - MMP surface expression in epithelial tumor cells , which form invadopodia , and Dyn2 negatively regulating MT1 - MMP surface expression in mesenchymal cells , which degrade the ECM by an invadopodia - independent mechanism . Of note , the distinct types of matrix degradation accomplished by tumor cells versus stromal fibroblasts were not attributed to an endocytic block alone , as inhibiting endocytosis by siRNA - mediated knockdown of clathrin exacerbated both the invadopodia - based matrix degradation of tumor cells , and the reticular , non - invadopodial degradation of fibroblasts , and also induced a distinct , fibrous pattern of degradation by the PSC - 2 cells ( Fig . 6j - q ) . Therefore , while clathrin - mediated endocytosis contributes to matrix degradation in different cell types , presumably due to internalization and clearance of the degradative machinery , it is not the sole factor that distinguishes between the alternate degradative pathways . The findings in Fig . 5 suggested that the upregulation of degradation by the stromal cells was mediated by an increase in MMP - 2 activity . While depletion of Dyn2 in fibroblasts led to a dramatic increase in matrix degradation , as described above , this was completely prevented by knockdown of MMP - 2 ( Fig . 7a - h ) , suggesting that MMP - 2 is indeed required for stromal matrix degradation . Similarly , siRNA - mediated knockdown of MT1 - MMP resulted in a loss of MMP - 2 activity ( Fig . 7b ) , and also blocked matrix degradation in the Dyn2 knockdown cells , demonstrating that both proteases are required for this large - scale , invadopodia - independent matrix degradation ( Fig . 7a - h ) . In contrast , whereas depletion of MT1 - MMP in DanG tumor cells completely blocked matrix degradation , knockdown of MMP - 2 had less of an effect ( Fig . 7i - p ) . Similarly , treatment of fibroblasts with the MMP - 2 / MMP - 9 inhibitor SB - 3CT completely blocked the matrix degradation amplified by loss of Dyn2 , but had less of an effect on DanG tumor cells ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . These data support a model by which MT1 - MMP is a major activator of matrix degradation by both stromal cells and tumor cells , but that stromal cell degradation is mediated through MMP - 2 , whereas tumor cell degradation is less dependent upon MMP - 2 . Further , MMP - 2 activation appears to distinguish the tubular / reticular degradation of mesenchymal cells from the punctate , MMP - 2 - independent , invadopodial degradations made by epithelial tumor cells ( Fig . 7n ) . Fibroblast - based matrix degradation promotes invasion by pancreatic tumor cells Our findings indicate that fibroblasts can degrade the extracellular matrix by a novel mechanism that is distinct from tumor - associated invadopodia . In the context of the tumor Cao et al . Page 6 Oncogene . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 May 18 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t microenvironment , it is hypothesized that cross - talk between the tumor cells and stromal cells primes tumor cells for metastasis , with the fibroblasts creating a permissive environment that promotes invasion . One model is that the stromal cells contribute to tumor cell invasion by degrading and remodeling the extracellular matrix to allow tumor cell escape . Therefore , we tested if the fibroblast - based matrix degradation could support invasion by tumor cells in vitro using a co - culture model system . PANC1 pancreatic tumor cells , which do not degrade a gelatin matrix , show minimal invasion through a gelatin - coated transwell membrane . We tested if providing stromal cells to degrade the matrix could promote PANC1 cell invasion . To this end , PANC1 cells were co - cultured with the stromal fibroblasts described above , and the resulting transwell invasion by PANC1 cells was quantified . Rat fibroblasts or CAFs were depleted of Dyn2 by siRNA , and then were co - cultured in a transwell invasion assay with PANC1 cells ( Fig . 8e ) . When plated together , PANC1 cells were able to invade across a gelatin - coated transwell filter . Strikingly , depletion of Dyn2 in the fibroblasts , which induces matrix degradation , resulted in a marked upregulation of PANC1 invasion . Similar results were observed using DKO fibroblasts that were incubated with or without 4HT to induce Dyn2 knockout ( Fig . 8a - d , f ) . The transwell invasion was inhibited by the MMP inhibitor BB - 94 , demonstrating that the invasion is dependent upon MMP activity and matrix degradation , and suggesting that the matrix - degrading capacity of the stromal fibroblasts promotes the transwell invasion of the tumor cells . In line with these observations , co - culture with tumor cells capable of degrading the matrix should also promote the invasion of the PANC1 tumor cells . Indeed , co - culture with DanG cells , which exhibit potent matrix degradation , dramatically increased the transwell invasion of the PANC1 cells . In contrast to the stromal fibroblasts , siRNA - mediated depletion of Dyn2 in the DanG cells completely suppressed the induced invasion , consistent with the inhibitory effect on matrix degradation ( Fig . 8g , Fig . 2 ) . These data demonstrate that the invadopodia - independent matrix degradation inducible in fibroblasts is capable of promoting invasion of co - cultured tumor cells , and defines a novel mechanism by which fibroblast - tumor cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment could contribute to metastasis . Discussion Complex interactions between tumor cells and neighboring stromal cells regulate tumor progression and metastasis . In a mutualistic interaction , tumor cells activate adjacent fibroblasts , which then are primed both to remodel the extracellular matrix and secrete trans - acting factors to regulate the tumor cells . It has been proposed that CAFs can also secrete matrix - degrading proteases that could allow for the escape of tumor cells from the primary tumor . While tumor cells often degrade the matrix through the formation of specialized protrusions called invadopodia , in contrast , here we report a distinct mechanism of matrix degradation by fibroblasts regulated by the activity of the large GTPase Dyn2 . This degradation is independent of invadopodia , as it exhibits a distinct pattern of degradation , does not require the activity of the kinase Src or the GTPase Cdc42 , and is actually repressed , rather than supported , by the action of Dyn2 . This novel form of matrix Cao et al . Page 7 Oncogene . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 May 18 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t degradation can support invasion by tumor cells , indicating a new mechanism by which stromal fibroblasts can promote tumor cell invasion . CAFs have been extensively described as tumor - promoting , although their ablation also contributes to enhanced tumor growth and progression ( 22 , 23 ) , indicating a complex relationship between CAFs and tumor cells in vivo . CAFs promote tumor progression through secretion of cytokines and growth factors that stimulate tumor cell growth and migration , through maintenance of cancer stem cell properties , and by contributing to tumor cell metabolism ( 12 , 24 - 29 ) . In addition , CAFs have been implicated as direct regulators of tumor cell migration through mechanical regulation or serving as “leader” cells ( 7 , 30 ) . In this manuscript , we focus on the matrix - remodeling contribution of fibroblasts from both normal and neoplastic tissue . This matrix remodeling is highly relevant to multiple pathological settings such as fibrosis and wound healing , and is also able to promote tumor cell invasion in vitro ( Fig . 8 ) , demonstrating a significance during metastasis . What is the structural basis of this invadopodia - independent matrix degradation in stromal fibroblasts ? The pattern of degradation is reticular , suggesting a “tethering” of the proteases by cytoskeletal elements , yet we observed no obvious colocalization with a variety of cytoskeletal and organelle markers such as actin , cortactin , tubulin , the Golgi protein GM130 , clathrin , or focal adhesion markers ( Fig . 1 , Supplementary Fig . S2 , and data not shown ) . Our data suggest that this degradation is due to increased surface expression of MT1 - MMP and increased activity of MMP - 2 , a secreted protease . However , the degradation is clearly focal , suggesting that the degradation is still associated with the membrane or a membrane - associated structure , and not just a result of excess soluble protease . Of note is the copious amount of matrix degradation induced in the fibroblasts in a short timeframe , compared to modest , punctate degradation originating from invadopodia ( Figs . 1 , 2 ) . While localized invadopodial degradation may be useful at the tip of an invading tumor cell to sense or degrade its local environment , the findings presented here raise the intriguing possibility that this novel type of fibroblast - derived matrix degradation may be important for large - scale matrix remodeling or invasion . What molecular mechanisms account for the differences in matrix degradation between stromal and epithelial - derived tumor cells ? Our data indicate that Dyn2 differentially regulates MMP - 2 activity ( Fig . 5 ) , likely through surface expression of MT1 - MMP . In fibroblasts , depletion of Dyn2 results in increased MT1 - MMP at the cell surface ( Fig . 6 ) , consistent with the model that Dyn2 may be required for MT1 - MMP endocytosis and internalization ( 21 ) . Increased MT1 - MMP at the surface would be available to activate extracellular MMP - 2 , which is increased in fibroblasts . However , inhibition of endocytosis by clathrin knockdown does not always phenocopy loss of Dyn2 , particularly in epithelial tumor cells ( Fig . 6 ) . It is surprising that Dyn2 has these differential effects on MT1 - MMP surface expression between the two cell types , and it will be important to determine how either MT1 - MMP and / or Dyn2 are differentially regulated between mesenchymal and epithelial - derived cells . How would this large - scale , invadopodia - independent degradation be induced in the context of human tumors ? Fibroblast - derived matrix degradation was upregulated in this study by Cao et al .

While it is possible that Dyn2 expression is lost in CAFs , it is more likely that Dyn2 - regulated signaling pathways could be altered in CAFs , such as endocytic or endosomal trafficking , or Dyn2 - regulated cytoskeletal networks . Importantly , the differential regulation of matrix remodeling between tumor and stromal cells will increase the complexity of designing therapies to block tumor cell invasion . Inhibitors targeting classical invadopodial - based matrix degradation in tumor cells would not inhibit the large - scale matrix degradation inducible in fibroblasts , and could actually potentiate it , as in the case of Dyn2 depletion . These findings underscore the importance of defining the contributions of diverse cell types in the tumor microenvironment , and in understanding the basic cell biology underlying the mechanisms of invasion and migration in distinct cell types .

The gel was then incubated in 2 . 5 % Triton X - 100 at room temperature for 40 minutes with shaking , and rinsed with incubation buffer ( 50 mM Tris - B pH8 . 0 ; 150 mM NaCl ; 10 mM CaCl ; 0 . 05 % NaN 3 ) , then soaked in incubation buffer at 37°C for 20 ~ 24 hours in a shaking waterbath . The gel was then rinsed three times with dH2O , stained with Coomassie blue for 40 minutes at room temperature , and destained at room temperature for 2 hours . Fluorescent Gelatin Degradation Assay Gelatin - coated coverslips were prepared as described using Oregon green 488 - labeled gelatin ( Life Technologies ) at a 1 : 8 ratio with unlabeled gelatin ( 11 ) . Cells were plated on gelatin - coated coverslips and incubated for 8 hours . Alternatively , cells were incubated overnight in the presence of 2 μM BB - 94 ( Tocris ) . The following day , BB - 94 was washed out and the cells were incubated for 8 hours before fixation and staining . Cell Invasion Assay Polycarbonate membranes ( NeuroProbe , Inc . , Gaithersburg , MD ) containing 8 μm pores were coated with 0 . 3 % gelatin and assembled into Blind Well Chambers ( NeuroProbe , Inc . ) . PANC - 1 were stably transduced with a lentivirus to express mDsRed ( 35 ) , and were mixed with the indicated cell types in low - serum media ( 0 . 2 % FBS ) . 1×10 5 PANC1 and 2×10 4 stromal cells were plated into the top chamber . The lower chamber contained DMEM with 10 % FBS . After 8 hours , the cells were removed from the top of the filter , and the filters were fixed with formaldehyde , stained with DAPI and FITC - Phalloidin ( Sigma ) , and imaged by fluorescence microscopy . Cells were scored as invaded if the nucleus had crossed the filter . The number of PANC1 cells on the bottom of the filter was counted in 4 - 5 10× fields per filter . Immunofluorescence and Microscopy Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously ( 32 ) . Cells were incubated in primary antibodies for 2 h at 37°C ( myc or FLAG polyclonal , Cell Signaling Cao et al . Page 10 Oncogene . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 May 18 .

Matrix degrading fibroblasts accentuate the transwell invasion of tumor cells PANC1 tumor cells , which do not degrade a gelatin matrix or invade across a transwell filter , were transduced to stably express mDsRed . The labeled PANC1 cells were cultured alone or co - cultured with stromal cells in a transwell invasion assay . ( a - d ) Representative images showing PDAC cells that have invaded across a gelatin - coated transwell membrane . PANC1 tumor cells were cultured individually ( a ) , or co - cultured with parental DKO MEFs ( b ) or DKO MEFs treated with tamoxifen ( 4HT ) to induce loss of Dyn2 ( c ) . ( d ) Invasion was significantly reduced by the MMP inhibitor BB - 94 . All cells were labeled with FITC - Phalloidin ( actin cytoskeleton ) and DAPI ( nuclei ) . ( e - g ) The number of PANC1 cells that invaded across the membrane was scored . ( e ) PANC1 were co - cultured with either rat fibroblasts ( RF ) or CAFs transfected with either a nontargeting siRNA or an siRNA targeting Dyn2 . ( f ) PANC1 were co - cultured with parental DKO MEFs or DKO MEFs treated with tamoxifen to knock out Dyn1 / 2 . Note that PANC1 tumor cells alone are unable to invade to the bottom of the transwell filter . This migration is increased upon the addition of control fibroblasts , an effect that is potentiated further upon the reduced expression of Dyn2 . ( g ) PANC1 cells were co - cultured with DanG pancreatic tumor cells that were transfected with either a non - targeting siRNA or an siRNA targeting Dyn2 . In the DanG tumor cells , note that reduction of Dyn2 , which decreases matrix degradation , also decreases PANC1 invasion . In both ( f ) and ( g ) , treatment with the MMP inhibitor BB - 94 reduced invasion , showing that it is MMP - dependent . Graphed data represent the mean + / − S .
