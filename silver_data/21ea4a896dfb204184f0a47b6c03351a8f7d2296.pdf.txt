The aim of this study was to test the cellular biocompatibility and transport of Nile Red - loaded NSVs ( NR - NSVs ) across the Caco - 2 - cell monolayers , which represent an in vitro model of human intestinal epithelium . The NR - NSVs assumed a spherical shape with a mean size of 140nm , and a narrow size distribution . The NR - NSVs did not modify Caco - 2 cell viability , which remained unaltered in vitro up to a concentration of 1mM . The transport studies demonstrated that the NR - NSVs moved across the Caco - 2 monolayers without a ﬀ ecting the transepithelial electrical resistance . These results were supported by ﬂ ow cytometry analysis , which demonstrated that NR - NSVs were internalized inside the Caco - 2 cells . Nanoparticle tracking and Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM ) analysis showed the presence of NR - NSVs in the baso - lateral side of the Caco - 2 monolayers . TEM images also showed that NSVs were transported intact across the Caco - 2 monolayers , thus demonstrating a predominant transcytosis mechanism of transport through en - docytosis . The NSVs did not a ﬀ ect the integrity of the membrane barrier in vitro , and can potentially be used in clinics to increase the oral bioavailability and delivery of therapeutics . 1 . Introduction Oral drug administration is widely used in clinics to treat many diseases due to the fact that it is painless and that patients can medicate themselves which allows it to meet with a great degree of patient compliance and this , in turn , means a good degree of adherence to therapeutic regimens . Oral therapy is also cheaper than systemic therapy in the treatment of chronic diseases , and its regime is ﬂ exible and easy to manage as compared with systemic administration . Unfortunately , the physiological barriers ( gastric acid pH ) , the poor water solubility and stability of drugs , and their biopharmaceutical features ( retention , permeation and metabolism ) limit the oral ab - sorption of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs [ 1 , 2 ] . Even though the bene ﬁ ts for patients are greater than the drawbacks , oral adminis - tration represents the main therapeutic option for treating chronic diseases . Physiological hurdles do exist though , and cannot be over - come using conventional medicines . In this attempt , colloidal nano - particles were developed to deliver payloads , and modulate and target drugs to speci ﬁ c tissues after oral administration [ 3 ] . Speci ﬁ c polymeric nanoparticles , micelles and liposomes were designed to promote oral absorption , improve the bioavailability of drugs , and allow their pas - sage through the tight junctions ( TJs ) . These colloidal nanoparticles can resist inactivation by acid ( pH 2 – 4 ) and digestive enzymes , and protect payloads from degradation following oral administration , thus mod - ulating drug release and targeting speci ﬁ c tissues [ 4 – 8 ] . The mucus of the gastro - intestinal ( GI ) tract can also modify the oral delivery of colloidal nanoparticles besides their transport across the GI barrier , thus a ﬀ ecting the therapeutic response of the drug in various acute and chronic diseases [ 9 – 11 ] . Size , surface properties , and particle con - centrations can all in ﬂ uence the transport of colloidal nanoparticles https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . ejpb . 2018 . 03 . 013 Received 21 December 2017 ; Received in revised form 16 March 2018 ; Accepted 28 March 2018 ⁎ Corresponding authors . 1 These authors contributed equally to this work .

T across the human mucus monolayer [ 9 , 12 ] . In fact , the experimental modi ﬁ cations of the surfaces of the col - loidal nanoparticles allowed them to overcome the mucus barrier , and increased their penetration across the epithelial cells of the GI tract [ 3 ] . Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , a food and drug administration ( FDA ) - ap - proved hydrophilic polymer , is currently being used to overcome the monolayer mucus barrier of the GI tract due to its long hydrophilic , polyethylene - oxide chains , which decrease the uptake of nanoparticles mediated by mononuclear phagocytic system ( MPS ) , avoid interaction between nanoparticles , and stabilize the nanoparticles in biological ﬂ uids [ 13 , 14 ] . Previous studies demonstrated that PEG - coated lipo - somes , orally administered to deliver insulin in diabetic rats , sig - ni ﬁ cantly increased their anti - diabetic response to insulin , and pro - vided a sustained hypoglycemic e ﬀ ect in hyperglycemic rats as compared to insulin delivered using naked liposomes . The resulting data demonstrated that the PEGylated liposomes were stable at the acid pH of the GI tract , prevented the degradation of bile salts , and inter - acted with the intestinal wall by adhering to the mucous layer [ 15 ] . Moreover , PEGylation facilitated the di ﬀ usion of the nanoparticles across the mucus barrier due to the e ﬀ ect of the interpenetration of the polymer network between the PEG chains and the mucus mesh ﬁ bers , and / or the hydrogen bonding that comes about between the ether oxygen atoms of PEG and the polysaccharide residues of glycosylated mucins [ 16 ] . The physicochemical properties of PEG such as density , molecular weight , and pending chain derivatives , can a ﬀ ect the di ﬀ u - sion of PEGylated nanoparticles through human mucus . In particular , several studies have demonstrated that the increase of PEG density and the decrease of the molecular weight of PEG increased the penetration of the nanoparticles in highly viscoelastic human mucus [ 17 – 20 ] . Through PEGylation , researchers can develop colloidal nano - particles which can e ﬀ ectively penetrate the mucus layer and then ac - cumulate on the surfaces of epithelial cells . Nanoparticles can move across the intestinal epithelium , and reach the blood stream by way of two di ﬀ erent routes : ( i ) paracellular , and ( ii ) transcellular pathways . Paracellular transport involves the passive di ﬀ usion of drugs through the intercellular spaces between adjacent epithelial cells ; however this is limited by the presence of the TJs [ 21 , 22 ] . The TJs provide a crucial structural support to the intestinal epithelium , maintain the constitutive cells in a cohesive and polarized condition and play a pivotal role in the di ﬀ usion of drugs across the intestinal monolayer [ 23 ] . The TJs , being the closely associated areas between two cells forming a virtual barrier that is impermeable to ﬂ uid , have pore sizes of 10 – 30 Å , and play an important role in controlling the permeability of epithelial cells . TJs also control the permeation of small hydrophilic drugs across the epi - thelium of the GI tract [ 1 ] . Transcellular transport includes passive di ﬀ usion , carrier - mediated transport , endocytosis , and transcytosis [ 24 ] . Passive di ﬀ usion depends on the size of nanoparticles , which limits their di ﬀ usion through cel - lular membranes and barriers . In order to overcome these drawbacks , the colloidal nanoparticles penetrate the cells by endocytosis [ 1 , 25 ] . The endocytic pathways include : ( i ) clathrin - mediated endocytosis , ( ii ) caveolae - mediated endocytosis , ( iii ) phagocytosis , ( iv ) macro - pinocytosis , ( v ) clathrin and caveolae - independent endocytosis [ 26 , 27 ] . In addition to using endocytic pathways , colloidal particles can also pass across the epithelial cell through transcytosis - mediated transport , which includes both endocytosis and exocytosis . The transcytosis of nanoparticles through epithelial cells involves cell - surface binding , endocytosis at the apical side of cell membranes , intracellular traf - ﬁ cking , and release at the basolateral side ( exocytosis ) of the cell membrane [ 1 , 28 , 29 ] . In a previous work , we demonstrated that NSVs of polysorbate 20 , which contain repeated polyethylene oxide units similar to the PEG in the hydrophilic region of the surfactant , were stable and mucoadhesive in vitro in simulated GI ﬂ uids [ 30 ] . NSVs are stable , safe , biocompatible , cheaper than liposomes , easily stored , and increased the therapeutic e ﬃ cacy of drugs in vitro and in vivo [ 31 – 33 ] . In this study , we investigated the physicochemical properties , such as average sizes , size distribution , zeta - potential , and morphology of the NSVs , their cytotoxicity ( Caco - 2 cells ) and intracellular uptake , besides the transport of PEGylated NSVs through the Caco - 2 cell epi - thelium barrier model . Caco - 2 cells are basically used as in vitro models of the intestinal barrier and are approved by the FDA as a model of the human intestinal barrier . They are useful for studying the transport of drugs through the GI tract [ 34 ] . However , the intestinal epithelium consists of di ﬀ erent types of cells , such as enterocytes , mucus - producing goblet cells , endocrine cells , and M cells . The Enterocytes make up the main population of GI cells , while goblet cells account for 10 – 24 % [ 35 ] . Co - cultures of Caco - 2 and goblet cells , i . e . HT29 - MTX and HT29 - H , are used to develop in vitro models of the human intestinal barrier that secretes mucus [ 35 , 36 ] . In order to mimic the intestinal barrier of the human GI tract , this barrier needs for the ratio between the Caco - 2 and goblet cells to be optimized . In addition , there may be basic di ﬀ erences between the composition of the mediums and the cell culture times of the Caco - 2 and goblet cells . In this attempt , we used only Caco - 2 cells with the aim of obtaining a polarized epithelium model similar to that of the GI tract so that the interaction between the epithelium and PE - Gylated NSVs could be studied . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Materials Tween ® 20 ( Tw20 ) , sephadex G - 75 , 9 - ( diethylamino ) - 5H - benzo [ R ] fenossazin - 5H - one ( Nile - Red or NR ) were obtained from Acros Organics ( Acros Organics BVBA , Geel , Belgium ) . Human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells ( Caco - 2 cells ) , trypan blue , 3 - ( 4 , 5 - di - methylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) , propi - dium iodide ( PI ) , Nonidet P - 40 , cholesterol ( CHOL ) and ribonuclease ( RNase ) A , chlorpromazine , methyl - β - cyclodextrin and genistein were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( Sigma Aldrich SRL , Milan , Italy ) . Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) , trypsin - EDTA solution 1× , Phosphate Bu ﬀ er Saline ( PBS ) , Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) , glutamine , penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Euro Clone ( West York , UK ) . 12 - BD Falcon ™ cell culture inserts ( pore size 0 . 4 μ m , growth area 0 . 9 cm 2 ) were obtained by Becton Dickinson ( Milan , Italy ) . All other products and reagents were of analytical grade . 2 . 2 . Synthesis and puri ﬁ cation of NSVs PEGylated non - ionic surfactant vesicles ( NSVs ) were made from Tw20 and CHOL at the same molar concentration ( 15 mM : 15 mM ) . NSVs were obtained using the thin - layer evaporation method as pre - viously reported [ 30 ] . The resulting ﬁ lm was then hydrated by adding the HEPES bu ﬀ er ( 10 mM , pH = 7 . 4 ) . NR - NVs were obtained by adding Nile Red ( 10 μ M ) to the Tw20 / CHOL organic mixture before forming the surfactant ﬁ lm . The resulting NSVs were vortex - mixed for 5 min and then sonicated for 10 min at 60 °C using a probe sonicator ( Hielscher , model UP200H , Teltow , Germany ) equipped with an exponential mi - croprobe operating at 24 kHz and amplitude of 60 % , in order to obtain unilamellar suspensions . Both empty and ﬂ uorescent NSVs were then puri ﬁ ed through Sephadex G - 75 glass columns to remove the excess of un - assembled surfactants , ﬂ uorescent probe and cholesterol . 2 . 3 . NSV characterization 2 . 3 . 1 . Size and zeta potential measurements The average size and size distribution of NSVs were measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS ( Malvern Instruments Ltd . , Worcestershire , UK ) . Brie ﬂ y , samples were diluted 1 : 50 ( v / v ) in HEPES bu ﬀ er ( 10 mM , pH = 7 . 4 ) to avoid multiscattering phenomena . The average size and size distribution were measured using photon correlation spectroscopy in line with cumulant mode ﬁ tting ( Malvern Instruments Ltd . , R . Primavera et al . European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 127 ( 2018 ) 432 – 442 433 Worcestershire , UK ) . The instrument was equipped with a 4 . 5 mW laser diode operating at 670 nm . Scattered photons were detected with a backscattering of 173° . A Zetasizer Nano ZS was also used to measure the zeta - potential of NSVs . The measurement was performed by using a Smoluchowski constant F ( Ka ) of 1 . 5 as a function of the electrophoretic mobility . Measurements represented the average of three batches ( 10 runs per measurements ) . Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis ( NTA ) was further used to evaluate the size of the NSVs . Brie ﬂ y , samples were diluted with PBS ( 1 : 60 , v / v ) under isosmotic condition , and monitored with a NanoSight NS300 mounted with a blue ( 488 nm ) laser ( Malvern Instruments Ltd . , Worcestershire , UK ) using 3 . 1 Build 3 . 1 . 54 software for analysis . The particle size and scattered light intensity of the individual nanoparticles were acquired through a high - sensitivity sCMOS camera and extra - polated from at least ﬁ ve di ﬀ erent videos . A video was taken at a rate of ≈ 25 frames / second . Experimental conditions of analysis are reported in Table 1 . 2 . 3 . 2 . Surfactants self - assembled into NSVs The assembling of surfactants into NSVs was evaluated using the colorimetric method as previously reported [ 30 ] . Brie ﬂ y , NSVs ( 10 ml ) , previously puri ﬁ ed through a Sephadex column , were treated with a cobalt thiocyanate solution ( 10 ml ) , and then extracted using di - chloromethane ( 10 ml ) . The concentration of self - assembled surfactants was evaluated by measuring the absorbance of the organic phase after the extraction with a Cary 50 Scan spectrophotometer ( Varian Inc . Corporate , Palo Alto , USA ) at 620 nm , and was quanti ﬁ ed by comparing results with those of a linear calibration curve of surfactants ( 0 . 6 – 10 μ g / ml ) . The percentage of self - assembled NSVs represented the ratio of surfactants ( w / w ) composing the NSVs as compared to the total amount added to the NSVs during the preparation procedure . 2 . 3 . 3 . Transmission electron microscopy analysis Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM ) was carried out as pre - viously reported [ 37 ] . Brie ﬂ y , the NSVs were suitable diluted before TEM analysis to avoid aggregation of colloidal nanoparticles ; the re - sulting suspensions were dropped onto a carbon - coated copper grid , and after 20 s of incubation the excess was removed using ﬁ lter paper . The samples were then air - dried at room temperature for 10 min and negatively stained with 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) uranyl acetate for 20 s . The TEM images and electron di ﬀ raction patterns were carried out at 100 KV with an electron microscopy Hitachi 7100 ( Hitachi Medical System S . p . A . , Milano , Italia ) in order to obtain good resolution and minimal radiation damage of the NSVs . 2 . 4 . Cell culture and treatment 2 . 4 . 1 . Caco - 2 cells Caco - 2 cells were used at passages 15 and 20 . The Caco - 2 cells were grown in the DMEM supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FCS , 1 % ( v / v ) non essential amino acid , 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 μ g / ml streptomycin ( complete medium ) , in a humidi ﬁ ed incubator 5 % CO 2 , 95 % air atmosphere at 37 °C . These culture conditions allowed the Caco - 2 cells to be proliferative and un - di ﬀ erentiated [ 38 ] . The cell culture medium was replaced every 2 days until cells reached 60 – 70 % con ﬂ uence and then harvested using a trypsin - EDTA solution to detach them from the bottom of the ﬂ ask . 2 . 4 . 2 . Cytotoxicity studies The cytotoxicity of the NSVs was tested using Caco - 2 cells by means of ( 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) ( MTT ) assay and dye exclusion testing . 2 . 4 . 2 . 1 . MTT test . The Caco - 2 cells were seeded in 96 - well culture dishes ( 20 , 000 cells / cm 2 ) and allowed 24 h to attach themselves . The culture medium was then removed , replaced with the NSVs at di ﬀ erent concentrations ( 0 . 25 – 5 mM ) , and incubated at various times ( 8 , 12 , 24 and 48 h ) . The NSVs were then removed , and 20 μ l of MTT ( 5 mg / ml in PBS ) were added to each well . After 4 h incubation , the MTT was removed and the resulting formazan crystals were dissolved with 200 μ l of a dimethylsulfoxide / ethanol solution ( 1 : 1 v / v ) . The 96 - well culture dishes were then shaken at 230 rpm ( Oscillating Stirrer 722 , ASAL s . r . l . Milan Italy ) for 20 min . The absorbance of di ﬀ erent samples was measured using an ELISA microplate reader ( iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader ) at 590 nm . The percentage of viable cells was determined according to the following equation ( Eq . ( 1 ) ) : = × Cell viability ( % ) ( Abs / Abs ) 100 ( T ) ( C ) ( 1 ) where Abs ( T ) is the absorbance of treated cells and Abs ( C ) is the absorbance of control ( untreated ) cells . The formazan concentration was proportional to the viable cell number . 2 . 4 . 2 . 2 . Trypan blue dye exclusion test . The Caco - 2 cells at 70 – 80 % con ﬂ uence were treated with NSVs at di ﬀ erent concentrations ( 0 , 1 , 4 mM ) and incubation times ( 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 h ) as previously reported [ 39 ] . Brie ﬂ y , the cells were detached using a solution of trypsin / EDTA , centrifuged ( 800 g for 10 min at 4 °C ) , and then washed twice with PBS . The supernatant was withdrawn and the resulting pellet was dissolved in a PBS . The cells were then counted using a Burker chamber and their viability was assessed by Trypan blue dye exclusion assay . The number of viable cells was calculated using the following equation ( Eq . ( 2 ) ) : = × Cell viability ( % ) ( V / T ) 100 c c ( 2 ) where V c is the number of viable cells and T c is the total number of cells ( living and dead cells ) . 2 . 4 . 3 . Cell cycle analysis The cell - cycle analysis was carried out by staining cell DNA with propidium iodide ( PI ) . The labeling cells were then analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . The Caco - 2 cells at 70 – 80 % of con ﬂ uence were treated with NSVs as reported for dye exclusion test ( Section 2 . 4 . 2 . 2 ) . After treat - ment , the medium was removed , the cells washed with PBS , harvested with a trypsin / EDTA solution , and ﬁ nally centrifuged ( 800 g for 10 min at 4 °C ) . The resulting pellet was washed in PBS , and ﬁ xed in ice - cold ethanol ( 70 % ) at 4 °C for 30 min . The ﬁ xed cells ( 10 6 cells / ml ) were then washed twice with the ice - cold PBS , and stained with a mixture solution of propidium iodide ( 50 μ g / ml ) , Nonidet - P40 ( 0 . 1 % v / v ) , and RNase A ( 6 μ g / 10 6 cells ) for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C . Cell - cycle phase - distribution was analyzed using a ﬂ ow cytometry . Data from 10 , 000 events per sample were collected and analyzed using a FACSCalibur ( Beckton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) instrument equipped with a cell - Table 1 Set - up of Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis . The di ﬀ erent parameters of Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis were reported . The setting of instruments al - lows performing the analysis and data acquisition to be performed at the best resolution .

The results were expressed as the percentage of cells in each phase of the cycle . Apop - totic cells were determined by their hypochromic subdiploid staining pro ﬁ les , and analyzed using Cell Quest software ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) . 2 . 4 . 4 . Transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) analysis The Caco - 2 cells were seeded at a density of 400 , 000 cells / insert in 12 - well cell culture inserts ( pore size 0 . 4 μ m , growth area 0 . 9 cm 2 ) , incubated with the complete DMEM for 16 – 21 days at 37 °C , 95 % re - lative humidity , and 5 % CO 2 . The medium was replaced every 2 days with 1 . 0 ml of fresh medium in the apical ( AP ) chamber , and 1 . 5 ml in the basolateral ( BL ) chamber . The integrity of the cell monolayer was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) using a Millicell ERS - 2 system ( Millipore Corporation , Bedford , MA ) , equipped with STX01 electrode ( World Precision Instruments , Sarasota , FL ) , and visually checked under a light microscope . Images were acquired by an inverted light microscope ( Eclipse TS 100 , Nikon ) at 10 × and 20 × magni ﬁ cations . The TEER values of each monolayer were evaluated every 2 days . The TEER value was determined according to the following equation ( Eq . ( 3 ) ) : = × TEER ( R - R ) A Sample Blank Transwell ( 3 ) where R Sample was the resistance of insert with the Caco - 2 cells , R Blank was the resistance of no cells insert , and A Transwell was the membrane surface area of the transwell . Inserts with initial TEER values between 800 and 1000 Ω × cm 2 and with unbroken and polarized cell monolayers , similar to the epithelial lining of small intestine ( Fig . 1 ) , were used for the uptake and transport experiments across the Caco - 2 monolayer [ 40 , 41 ] . Results were the average of four di ﬀ erent experiments as duplicated . All the values were normalized according to the initial TEER value obtained for each sample . 2 . 4 . 5 . Uptake and transport of NR - NSVs across the polarized enterocyte monolayers Caco - 2 cells forming a whole monolayer were incubated with complete DMEM ( control ) , empty NSVs ( 1 mM ) and NR - NSVs ( 1 mM ) at di ﬀ erent times ( 0 – 8 h ) . At the end of the incubation time , the medium was removed from the AP and BL chambers , and replaced with the same volume of PBS for TEER determination as reported ( Section 2 . 4 . 4 ) . The media of the AP and BL chambers were withdraw and collected for the NTA and TEM analysis ; while the Caco - 2 monolayer was harvested using trypsin / EDTA , centrifuged ( 400 g for 10 min at 4 °C ) , washed twice with 2 ml PBS ( 400 g for 10 min at 4 °C ) , and then suspended in 1 ml of PBS . In order to detect NSV uptake , the living cells were de - termined through trypan blue exclusion testing ( check experimental details in Section 2 . 4 . 2 . 2 ) , suspended at a ﬁ nal concentration of 10 6 cell / ml and analysed by ﬂ ow cytometry . To distinguish the associated or bound vesicles from the internalized vesicles , the cells were treated with trypan blue as previously reported [ 27 ] . The ﬂ uorescent cells ( 20 , 000 cells ) were analyzed in FL2 channel ( λ exc = 488 nm and λ em = 625 nm ) by FACSCalibur ﬂ ow cytometry . The vesicle uptake monitored by Nile - Red ﬂ uorescence was shown as histogram mode on a logarithmic scale . The resulting graphs showed the percentage of ﬂ uorescent - positive cells . The ﬂ uorescence intensity of the empty NSVs taken up from Caco - 2 cells was used as blank . The NSV sizes and concentrations in AP and BL were also evaluated by using the NTA analysis ( check experimental details in Section 2 . 3 . 1 ) . 2 . 4 . 6 . Mechanism of the transport of PEGylated NSVs across Caco - 2 cells Caco - 2 cells were incubated together with the pharmacological in - hibitors of di ﬀ erent cellular endocytosis pathways : i ) chlorpromazine , ii ) methyl - β - cyclodextrin and iii ) genistein . The concentration of the inhibitors was dosed at sub - toxic concentrations ( data not shown ) . Caco - 2 cells were pre - incubated with chlorpromazine ( 10 μ g / ml ) and genistein ( 2 . 5 mg / ml ) for 60 min at 37 °C in complete mediums ; whereas methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( 5 . 6 mg / ml ) was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C . The NR - NSVs ( 1 mM ) were then added to the Caco - 2 cells , and the cells were incubated for another hour at 37 °C . The Caco - 2 cells incubated with chlorpromazine were washed with PBS ( 3 times ) , and then incubated with NR - NSVs for 15 min , because the e ﬀ ects of chlor - promazine are quickly reversible [ 27 ] . After incubation , the cells were further washed with cold PBS , harvested using trypsin / EDTA , cen - trifuged ( 400 g for 10 min at 4 °C ) , washed twice with 2 ml PBS ( 400 g for 10 min at 4 °C ) , and then suspended in PBS ( 1 ml ) . The resulting cell suspension was investigated by ﬂ ow cytometry as herein reported ( check experimental details in Section 2 . 4 . 5 ) . The control was Caco - 2 cells incubated with NR - NSVs ( 1 mM ) without inhibitors . Fig . 1 . Cell monolayer integrity . The cell monolayer integrity was evaluated using the transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) and optical microscope . The cartoon shows the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer in transwell dishes and the values of TEER , which re - sulted in an intact monolayer ( A ) . A re - presentative optical image of Caco - 2 - cell monolayer , showing three independent ex - periments , at 1day ( B ) , 10days ( C ) , and 19days ( D ) was herein reported . The mag - ni ﬁ cation was 10× for Caco - 2 - cell mono - layer incubated at 10 ( C ) and 19 ( D ) days , and 20× for Caco - 2 - cell monolayer in - cubated at 1day ( B ) . R . Primavera et al .

Statistical analysis Data are the mean of two di ﬀ erent experiments ± standard de - viation ( SD ) or standard error of mean ( SEM ) unless otherwise speci - ﬁ ed . Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 6 . 0 Software ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , San Diego , CA , U . S . A . ) . The Student ’ s un - paired t test was used to compare the clusters of analysis . One or two - way ANOVA and Bonferroni post – hoc tests were used during the ana - lysis . Values of p < 0 . 05 , p < 0 . 01 and p < 0 . 001 were considered statistically signi ﬁ cant , highly signi ﬁ cant , and hugely signi ﬁ cant , re - spectively . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 . Physicochemical characterization of NSVs The mean sizes of NSVs were determined through DLS and NTA analysis . DLS analysis showed that NR - NSVs had narrow size dis - tributed ( polydispersity index below 0 . 2 ) , and had a mean size of 138 ± 0 . 39 nm ( Fig . 2A ) . This data was in agreement with the NTA analysis ( Fig . 2B ) , which demonstrated that the nanoparticles had a mean equivalent spherical size similar to that seen during DLS analysis . These results depended on the narrow size distribution of NSVs . In fact , larger particles generated positive and negative interference in the scattered light due to their relative Brownian motion in suspension , providing a signi ﬁ cant variation of the hydrodynamic radius obtained through DLS analysis [ 42 ] . Conversely , the NTA analysis directly measure the di ﬀ usion of single particles in a heterogeneous suspension by applying the Stokes - Einstein equation and normalizing the e ﬀ ect of noise due to the interference of the Brownian motion of the particles [ 43 ] . The size distribution , zeta - potential , and entrapment e ﬃ ciency of the NR - NSVs were all in agreement with data previously reported [ 44 ] . The percentage of Tw20 self - assembled into the NSVs was 40 . 26 % and 47 . 55 % for empty - and NR - NSVs , respectively ( Table S1 ) . NTA analysis allowed further evaluation of the particle concentra - tion of NR - NSVs [ 43 ] , which was 2 . 66 e + 13 ± 1 . 24e + 12 ( particles / ml ) ( Fig . 2B ) . The morphology of NR - NSVs was carried out by TEM , which showed that the NSVs had a spherical and / or ellipsoidal shape , and were unilamellar ( Fig . 2C ) . TEM data was in agreement with the DLS analysis ( Fig . 2A ) . 3 . 2 . Cell viability of NSVs The MTT assay demonstrated that the cell viability was time - and dose - dependent ; in particular , the cell viability percentage ( 80 – 100 % ) was not a ﬀ ected by the NSV concentration in the range between 0 . 025 and 1 . 5 mM at di ﬀ erent incubation times ( Fig . S1 ) . Conversely , a sig - ni ﬁ cant ( p < 0 . 05 ) degree of cell toxicity was obtained by treating Caco - 2 cells with at NSVs 2 . 5 mM ( % of viable cells ≈ 20 % ) . Similar results were obtained using NSVs at 4 and 5 mM , respectively ( Fig . S1 ) . This e ﬀ ect depends on the lack of the integrity of Caco - 2 - cell monolayer occurring after a toxic administration in vitro of bioactive compounds and macromolecules [ 45 , 46 ] . The cytotoxicity of NSVs at 1 and 4 mM was also evaluated by using trypan - blue dye ( Fig . 3 ) . The results demonstrated that the percentage of living cells was ≈ 90 % at a 1 mM concentration of NSVs at di ﬀ erent incubation times ( Fig . 3 ) . This data was similar to control ( untreated cells ) , thus showing the lack of toxicity of NSVs . Conversely , a 4 mM concentration of NSVs was signi ﬁ cantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) toxic to the Caco - 2 cells , and less than 25 % of the cells were still alive after treatment at di ﬀ erent incubation times ( Fig . 3 ) . The signi ﬁ cant cytotoxicity of NSVs at a 4 mM concentration may have depend on the high viscosity of the resulting nanoparticle suspension , and the dehydration and clumping of the cells as previously reported for branched and linear polymeric de - rivatives , similar to the polyethylene oxide units of surfactants forming the NSVs [ 47 ] . The microscopic analysis of transwell inserts containing Caco - 2 - cell monolayer without any treatment ( control ) ( Fig . 4A ) , was similar to the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer treated with NSVs at a 1 mM concentration ( Fig . 4B ) , and did not show any signi ﬁ cant morphological changes . Conversely , the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer of samples treated with NSVs at a 4 mM concentration did not form a continuous monolayer and showed di ﬀ erent cell - free zones compared to control ( Fig . 4C ) . 3 . 3 . E ﬀ ect of NSVs on the cell - cycle pro ﬁ le of Caco - 2 cells The alteration of cell - cycle progression of the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer Fig . 2 . Physicochemical characterization of NR - NSVs . The average sizes of NR - NSVs were determined through DLS ( A ) , NTA ( B ) and TEM ( C ) analysis . Data of DLS and NTA analysis were the mean ± S . D . of three independent experiments in triplicate , while the TEM analysis was a representative image of three in - dependent experiments . R . Primavera et al . European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 127 ( 2018 ) 432 – 442 436 treated with NSVs was evaluated at 1 mM and 4 mM concentrations . This was to measure the DNA content of living cells staining with PI , and was done by means of a ﬂ ow cytometry The cell percentage in the di ﬀ erent phases of their cycle was compared to control ( complete DMEM ) ( Table 2 ) . The results demonstrated that NSVs at 1 mM con - centration had no e ﬀ ect on the cell - cycle distribution of the Caco - 2 cells at di ﬀ erent incubation times ( Fig . 5 and Table 2 ) ; whereas NSVs at a concentration of 4 mM modi ﬁ ed the cell - cycle distribution of the Caco - 2 cells as compared to the control cell ( Fig . 5 and Table 2 ) groups . In fact , the G2 - phase of the Caco - 2 cells decreased , while the S - phase increased at di ﬀ erent incubation times ( Fig . 5 and Table 2 ) . The resulting data demonstrated that the NSVs were not toxic at the 1 mM concentration ( Fig . 5 and Table 2 ) . In order to ascertain whether the treatment of the Caco - 2 cells with 4 mM was associated with the induction of apoptosis , the population of the cells in the sub - G1 was analyzed . The percentage of the apoptotic Caco - 2 cells ( analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry ) which ac - cumulated in the hypochromic subdiploid peak increased when the cells had been treated with 4 mM of NSVs . These results demonstrated that no signi ﬁ cant apoptosis was ob - tained when the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer was treated at a 1 mM con - centration ( Table S2 ) as can be seen from the lack of cell population in the sub - G1 apoptotic peak ( < 5 % ) ( Table S2 ) ; conversely , apoptosis ( < 10 % ) increased when Caco - 2 cells were treated with NSVs at a concentration of 4 mM for 8 and 12 and 24 h ( Table S2 ) . 3 . 4 . TEER analysis of Caco - 2 - cell monolayer treated with NSVS Caco - 2 - cell monolayers were used as an in vitro model of intestinal mucosa in order to evaluate the gastrointestinal transport of hydro - philic macromolecules as previously reported [ 48 ] . The TEER values of Caco - 2 - cell monolayers can be used to predict the opening of TJs be - tween epithelial cells and the permeation of nanoparticles through the paracellular pathway [ 49 , 50 ] . The TEER values decreased signi ﬁ cantly when nanoparticles broke the integrity of the epithelial monolayer by opening the TJs , thus showing their passage through gastrointestinal barriers via the paracellular route . In this attempt , the TEER analysis may con ﬁ rm the e ﬀ ect of NSVs on the TJs in the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer . The treatment of Caco - 2 - cell monolayers using NR - NSVs ( 1 mM ) did not signi ﬁ cant ( p > 0 . 05 ) modify the TEER values at di ﬀ erent in - cubation times ( Fig . 6 ) , thus demonstrating that the integrity of the monolayer remained intact . Lin et al . demonstrated that the surface charge of nanoparticles a ﬀ ects the opening of TJs ; in particular , the TJs are opened by positively - charged nanoparticles and are unchanged by using negatively - charged nanoparticles are used [ 51 ] . Moreover , PE - Gylated nanoparticles can permeate across the Caco - 2 monolayer via the transcellular pathway [ 52 ] . Conversely , the NSVs did not permeate across the TJs of epithelial cells , maybe due to the presence of the – OH groups in the polyethylene oxide ( PEO ) chains of the surfactants . The PEO moieties decreased the adhesion of the NSVs to the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer , and shrank the opening of TJs , which were in contact with PEG coating of the PEGylated nanoparticles [ 53 ] . 3 . 5 . Transcellular transport The TEER analysis demonstrated that the NSVs did not a ﬀ ect the integrity of the TJs of the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer by opening them , thus showing that they can move across whole biological membranes using di ﬀ erent pathways . The uptake and tra ﬃ cking of the NSVs through the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer was then evaluated by ﬂ ow cytometry . The Caco - 2 - cell monolayers treated with NR - NSVs showed that the per - centage of positive cells ( Fig . 7A ) and their ﬂ uorescent intensity ( Fig . 7B ) increased at di ﬀ erent incubation times . These results de - monstrated that the NR - NSVs were taken up inside the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer , thus increasing the resulting ﬂ uorescent intensity of the cells . This e ﬀ ect was time - dependent for the ﬂ uorescent NSVs . The Caco - 2 cells treated with empty NSVs showed a ﬂ ow cytometry pro ﬁ le that overlapped with that of cells incubated with cell culture medium ( Fig . 7B ) . Conversely , the ﬂ ow cytometry pro ﬁ le shifted to the right side of the graphs , thus showing an increased ﬂ uorescence of NR inside the positive Caco - 2 cells ( Fig . 7B ) . Other studies also demonstrated a transport of anionic and PEGylated nanoparticles inside Caco - 2 - cell monolayer by transcytosis . In fact , these nanoparticles can penetrate across the Caco - 2 - cell monolayers by means of lipid raft / caveolae - mediated endocytosis at the apical side of the membrane , and then leave the cell membrane by exocytosis at the basolateral side [ 52 , 54 – 56 ] . Fig . 3 . E ﬀ ect of NSVs on Caco - 2 cells . The cytotoxic e ﬀ ect of NSVs ( Tw20 : CHOL , 15mM : 15mM ) was evaluated by Trypan blue dye exclusion assay . Data were the mean ± S . D . of ﬁ ve independent experiments in tripli - cate . Standard deviation bars if not shown were within the symbols . * p ≤ 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant compared to control ( CTR ) . Fig . 4 .

Morphological analysis phase of Caco - 2 - cell monolayer treated with NSVs at 0mM ( control ) ( A ) , 1mM ( B ) , and 4mM ( C ) using the optical contrast microscopy . The images were a representative example of four independent experiments in triplicate . The images were acquired with a magni ﬁ cation of 20× . R . Primavera et al . European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 127 ( 2018 ) 432 – 442 437 Internalization experiments were performed using inhibitors of di ﬀ erent cellular endocytosis pathways to understand whether lipid raft / caveolae - mediated endocytosis is involved in the uptake of the NR - NSVs on the part of the Caco - 2 cells . The use of Chlorpromazine al - lowed us to distinguish clathrin - dependent endocytosis from lipid raft / caveolae - mediated endocytosis and the pinocytotic pathway [ 57 ] . A decrease of 14 % was observed in the uptake of the NR - NSVs by the Caco - 2 cells , when the Caco - 2 cells were incubated with chlorproma - zine , as compared to control ( untreated cells ) ( Fig . 8 ) . Conversely , methyl - β - cyclodextrin , a cyclic heptasaccharide capable of forming soluble inclusion complexes with cholesterol and hence to deplete this steroid from the lipid raft / caveolae microdomains of the plasmatic membrane [ 57 , 58 ] , decreased the uptake of the NR - NSVs by the Caco - 2 cells by a signi ﬁ cant 70 % , as compared to control ( untreated cells ) ( Fig . 8 ) . Polarized Caco - 2 epithelial cells expressed low levels of caveolins , which are integral membrane proteins associated with caveolar mem - brane invaginations [ 59 ] . In fact , the uptake of the NR - NSVs by the Caco - 2 cells incubated with genistein , a non - speci ﬁ c tyrosine kinase inhibitor which blocks caveolae - dependent endocytosis , fell by 27 % [ 60 ] . These results showed that the transcytosis / endocytosis of the NR - NSVs by the Caco - 2 cells mainly depended on lipid raft - endocytosis , although caveolae - endocytosis can also concur to transcytosis . Lipid rafts are microdomains of plasmatic membrane , rich in cho - lesterol and sphingolipids , which are platforms for the proteins ( ligands and receptors ) involved in the mechanisms of signal transduction and membrane tra ﬃ cking [ 61 , 62 ] . The internalization of extracellular macromolecules is mediated by lipid rafts or caveolae by either speci ﬁ c or non - speci ﬁ c interactions [ 63 ] ; therefore the non - speci ﬁ c interactions of NR - NSVs with the cellular receptors of the lipid raft might be Table 2 Cell - cycle analysis of Caco - 2 - cell monolayer using NSVs . The e ﬀ ect of NSVs on the cell cycle of Caco - 2 - cell monolayer was carried out using the ﬂ ow cytometry analysis . The NSVs were made up from Tw20 : CHOL ( 15mM : 15mM ) . The analysis was carried out at di ﬀ erent concentrations ( 0 – 1mM ) and incubation times ( 8 – 48h ) . Data were the mean ± SEM of two independent experiments in triplicate . A value of * p ≤ 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant with respect to control ( CTRL ) at 48h of incubation ; while # p ≤ 0 . 01 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant with respect control ( CTRL ) at 48h of incubation .

Cell - cycle analysis of Caco - 2 cells using ﬂ ow cytometry . The Caco - 2 - cell monolayer were treated with NSVs ( Tw20 : CHOL , 15mM : 15mM ) at two di ﬀ erent concentrations : 1mM ( A ) , and 4mM ( B ) . The analysis was carried out at di ﬀ erent incubation times ( 8 – 48h ) . The acquisition was carried out using the software Mod ﬁ t LT for Mac V3 . 0 . The panels were representative analysis of ﬁ ve independent experiments . R . Primavera et al . European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 127 ( 2018 ) 432 – 442 438 involved in the uptake of NR - NSVs . At the same time , the ﬂ uorescent intensity of NR - NSVs ( 1 mM ) in - cubated with the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer in the AP and BL chambers was also quanti ﬁ ed by using NTA analysis . Results showed that NR - NSVs moved from the AP to the BL chambers and the number of nanoparticles increased over the time ( Fig . 9A ) . In fact , the NSV concentration was 1 . 09e + 10 ± 1 . 36e + 8 particles / ml following 2 h of incubation and in - creased up to 1 . 52e + 10 ± 4 . 33e + 8 particles / ml ( 4h of incubation ) and 2 . 34e + 10 ± 8 . 25e + 8 ( 8h of incubation ) , respectively ( Fig . 8 ) . Inter - estingly , the accumulation of NR - NSVs in the BL chamber decreased their concentration in the AP chamber ( Fig . 9B ) at di ﬀ erent incubation times . Details of the dynamic process of the transport of the NR - NSVs in the Caco - 2 cells have been displayed in the Supporting Information Videos . Moreover , the sizes of the NR - NSVs measured by the NTA analysis on the AP and BL samples ( Fig . S2A and B ) were in agreement with the DLS ( Fig . 2B ) and TEM ( Fig . 10 ) analysis of NR - NSVs , respectively . The TEM analysis further showed that the NR - NSVs had similar sizes and shapes in both the AP and BL samples ( Fig . 10A ) , and their passage across the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer did not a ﬀ ect these parameters at 4 and 8 h ( Fig . 10C and D ) , thus demonstrated the pas - sage of intact NR - NSVs across the intestinal epithelial model of cellular monolayer . 4 . Conclusions We synthetized and physicochemically characterized stable NSVs , which were safe and which had the ability to pass intact across the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer . The Caco - 2 - cell monolayer was used as a sui - table in vitro model of the intestinal epithelium in order to evaluate the intracellular uptake and transport of the NSVs . Results demonstrated Fig . 6 . Transepithelial electrical resistance determination of Caco - 2 - cell monolayer . The integrity of Caco - 2 - cell monolayer was assured by incubating Caco - 2 cells with NR - NSVs ( 1mM ) at di ﬀ erent incubation times ( 0 – 8h ) . Untreated cells were used as control ( CTRL ) . The NR - NSVs were made of Tw20 : CHOL ( 15mM : 15mM ) and NR was loaded inside the NSVs during the hydration procedure . Data were the mean ± S . D . of four independent experi - ments in triplicate . Fig . 7 . Positive cell percentage of NR - NSVs in Caco - 2 - cell monolayer . The positive cell percentage of NR - NSVs was analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry in polarized enterocytes monolayers of Caco - 2 cells at di ﬀ erent incubation times ( 0 – 8h ) . Data were the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments in triplicate . A value of * p ≤ 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant for NR - NSVs at 1h of incubation with respect to data at 0h ; # p ≤ 0 . 0001 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant for NR - NSVs from 2 to 8h of incubations with respect to data at 0h ( A ) . The ﬂ ow cytometry pro ﬁ le of one experiment was herein reported .

E ﬀ ect of the di ﬀ erent endocytotic inhibitors on cell internalization of NR - NSVs . Cells were preincubated with chlorpromazine ( chlpmz ) , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( CyD ) and Genistein ( Genist ) as described in Section 2 . The Caco - 2 cells , with complete medium were used as control ( CTRL ) , while the others were subsequently incubated with 1mM NR - NSVs at di ﬀ erent as reported in Section 2 . After incubation , the Caco - 2 cells were washed , harvested and then analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . Bars represent the percentage of Caco - 2 positive cells after the treatment with 1mM NR - NSVs ; while the full black squares re - present the reduction percentage of 1mM NR - NSVs uptake from Caco - 2 cells after the treatment with inhibitors . The data are shown as mean ± SEM ob - tained from three independent experiments . Standard deviation bars if not shown were within the symbols . R . Primavera et al . European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 127 ( 2018 ) 432 – 442 439 that the NSVs with surface properties and composition similar to that of PEGylated nanoparticles did not a ﬀ ect the integrity of the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer in vitro . In fact , PEGylation allowed the adhesion of the nanoparticles to the intestinal epithelium , and activated the transcy - tosis pathway . The PEO polymeric chains of surfactants a ﬀ ect the bio - adhesive properties of the NSVs , thus introducing new strategies to increase the transport of therapeutic agents across a model of intestinal epithelial barrier . NSVs can also pass intact through the Caco - 2 - cell monolayer . The resulting data further demonstrated that the NSVs could be an innovative and promising nanocarrier for the potential oral administration of therapeutic agents ; can improve the patient com - pliance and consequent adherence to a therapeutic schedule .
