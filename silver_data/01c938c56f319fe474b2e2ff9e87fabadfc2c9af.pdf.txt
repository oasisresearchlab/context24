It has recently been reported that 8S clath - rin trimers or " triskelions " form larger 27S oligomers upon dialysis into low ionic strength buffers ( Prasad , K . , R . E . Lippoldt , H . Edelhoch , and M . S . Lewis , 1986 , Biochemistry , 25 : 5214 - 5219 ) . Here , deep - etch electron microscopy of the 27S species reveals that they are closed tetrahedra composed of four clathrin triskelions . This was determined by two approaches . First , standard quick - freezing and freeze - etching of unfixed 27S species suspended in 2 mM 2 - ( N - morpho - lino ) ethane sulfonic acid ( MES ) buffer , pH 5 . 9 , yielded unambiguous images of tetrahedra that measured 33 nm on each edge . Second , the technique of freeze - drying molecules on mica ( Heuser , J . E . , 1983 , J . Mol . Biol . , 169 : 155 - 195 ) was modified to overcome the low affin - ity of mica in 2 mM MES , by pretreating the mica with polylysine . Thereafter , 27S species adsorbed avidly to it and collapsed into characteristic configura - tions containing four globular domains , each linked to the others by three , ' , , 33 - nm struts . The globular do - mains look like vertices of deep - etched clathrin tri - skelions and the links , numbering 12 in all , look like four sets of triskelion legs . New light scattering and equilibrium centrifugation data confirm that 27S poly - mer is four times as massive as one clathrin tri - skelion . We conclude that in conditions that do not fa - vor the formation of standard clathrin cages , low affinity interactions lead to closed , symmetrical assem - blies of four triskelions , each of which assumes a unique puckered , straight - legged configuration to cre - ate the edges of a tetrahedron . Tetrahedra are similar in construction to the cubic octomers of clathrin re - cently found in ammonium sulfate solutions ( Sorger , P . K . , R . A . Crowther , J . T . Finch , and B . M . E Pearse , 1986 , J . Cell Biol . , 103 : 1213 - 1219 ) but are still smaller , involving only half as many clathrin tri - skelions . W P ' HEN clathrin - coated vesicles are exposed to 0 . 5 M Tris pH 7 ( 13 ) or 2 M urea ( 2 , 31 ) , their polygonal cages depolymerize into 8S components . These molecules have been named " triskelions " due to their three - legged pinwheel shape ( 27 ) . Triskelions dissociate further in SDS into three 180 - kD and three ~ o30 - kD polypeptides ( 14 , 17 , 18 , 22 , 24 , 27 ) , suggesting that each of their three " legs " is composed of one heavy and one light chain . Upon dialysis back into physiological ionic strength buffers , especially when the buffers are slightly acidic and when divalent cat - ions are present , triskelions reassemble spontaneously into empty " cages " that approximate the size and shape of the original vesicle coats ( 1 , 4 , 13 , 28 , 31 , 32 ) . Such empty cages sediment at (cid:127)150 - 300S ( 17 - 21 , 25 , 27 , 28 ) . If the dialysis conditions are altered , two smaller clathrin polymers will form , one sedimenting at , ' - , 42S and one at - - 27S . The 42S form occurs only when the dialysis solution also contains > 10 % saturated ammonium sulfate . Structural studies have shown that this species is a cube composed of eight triskelia ( 26 ) . In contrast , the 27S polymer apparently only forms when the dialysis solution is very low ionic strength ( 2 mM in the first report 23 ) . Equilibrium sedimentation analysis has suggested that the 27S species is a hexamer ( 23 ) , but structural analyses have not been done . Here we take advantage of the fact that 27S polymers of clathrin are stable at such low ionic strength that we can deep - etch and platinum - replicate them in suspension . Here - tofore , electron microscopic visualization of such small enti - ties by deep - etching has been thwarted by a residuum of salt that forms during etching ( the salt forming small granules that obscure small macromolecules , cf . references 8 and 9 ) , but freeze - etching of 2 mM solutions proves to leave very lit - tle salt scum . By combining this approach with our more standard technique of attaching molecules to mica and freeze - drying them ( 9 ) , we have demonstrated that the 27S polymer of clathrin is a tetrahedron composed of four clathrin triskelions , each of which assumes a unique puck - ered , straight - legged conformation . New equilibrium cen - trifugation and light scattering data are also presented to sup - port the conclusion that the 27S species is a tetramer , and to correct the earlier claim that it was a hexamer . These results were presented in abstract form earlier ( 11 ) . (cid:14)9 The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 87 / 11 / 1999 / I 1 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 105 , November 1987 1999 - 2009 1999 Materials and Methods Preparation of 8S Clathrin Triskelions Coated vesicles were purified from calf brains by homogenization and cen - trifugation as previously described ( 13 ) . Clathrin was released from coated vesicles with 0 . 5 M Tris pH 7 . 0 and separated from assembly polypeptides by chromatography on Scpharose C1 - 4B , also as previously described ( 13 ) . Polymerization of 27S Clathrin The 27S polymer was prepared from column - purified clathrin at , ' ~ 0 . 1 - 0 . 4 mg / ml , by reducing the Tris concentration from 0 . 5 M , first by overnight dialysis against 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 5 , and then by overnight dialysis against 2 mM Na - 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethane sulfonic acid ( MES ) buffer , pH 5 . 9 , with repeated changes of the dialysate . For sedimentation equilibrium studies , the solution was sedimented at 30 , 000 rpm for 30 rain in a Ti 70 . 1 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) to remove a small percentage ( 5 - 10 % ) of aggregates that sometimes form after dialysis . Polymerization of 42S Clathrin The 42S polymer was prepared from column - purified clathrin at ~ 1 mg / ml , by the procedure introduced in reference 26 . This involves overnight 4 ~ dialysis against 40 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM EI ~ A , 0 . 01 % 2 - mercapto - ethanol , 0 . 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , followed by a sec - ond overnight 4 ~ dialysis against 0 . 1 M Na - MES buffer pH 6 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , and 12 % saturated ammonium sulfate . Thereafter , the 42S species appeared to be stable indefinitely . Electron Microscopy Electron microscopy of 27S clathrin in suspension was accomplished by placing 10 - pl aliquots of 0 . 4 mg / ml clathrin in 2 mM Na - MES on 4 (cid:141) 4 - mm slabs of fixed rabbit lung ( for support ) and quick - freezing them by pressure against the liquid helium - chilled copper block of our " Cryopress " ( manu - factured by Med - Vac , Inc . , St . Louis , MO ) , as previously described ( 10 ) . The samples were then fractured , etched , and replicated with platinum by slight modifications of our standard procedures ( 8 - 10 ) , as indicated in the figure legends . Alternatively , images of 27S and 42S clathrin adsorbed to mica were obtained by prefixing them with glutaraldehyde ( 40 mM for 10 min at 4 ~ and then mixing them with mica chips pretreated with 10 mg / ml low molecular weight polylysine . The rationale for this adaptation of our standard mica - chip procedure is explained in the Results . Thereafter , the slurry of mica chips was quick - frozen , fractured , freeze - dried , and repli - cated with platinum as described earlier ( 9 , 15 ) . Images were recorded in a transmission electron microscope at 70 , 000 initial magnification as + 10 ~ stereo pairs and measured by mapping them onto a digitizing tablet while viewing them in three dimensions , as also described earlier ( 10 ) . Light Scattering Light scattering was measured at a wavelength of 430 tun , a temperature of 20 ~ and a scattering angle ofg0 * by using a square cuvette in a fluorom - eter ( model MPF - 3 ; Perkin Elmer Corp . , Norwalk , CT ) . The actual value we measured was Rayleighs ratio ( Ir2 / lo ) . The relation between this value , the turbidity ( x ) , and the molecular weight of the sample is given by the following equation ( cf . reference 3 ) : x = ( 8x / 3 ) ( Ir2 / lo ) = HCMP ( O ) , ( 1 ) where H = ( 32 ~ x3 / 3N ) ( no2 / L 4 ) ( dn / dc ) 2 . ( 2 ) Here , C is the concentration ( g / ml ) , N is the Avogadro constant , no is the refractive index of the solvent , dn / dc is the refractive index increment at constant chemical potential , X is the wavelength , and P ( O ) is the angular dependence of the scatter known as particle scattering factor . Analytical Ultracentrifugation An analytical ultracentrifuge ( model E ; Beckman Instruments , Inc . ) equipped with a photoelectric scanner was used for both velocity and equi - librium studies . Double sector cells , with a 12 - ram optical path length , were used for all experiments . Scans were taken at a wavelength of 280 nm . Velocity experiments were carried out in an AN - F - Ti rotor ( Beckman In - struments , Inc . ) at a speed of 20 , 000 rpm and a temperature of 23 ~ The radial position of the 50 % concentration point of the boundary as a function of time was used to compute the sedimentation coefficient . Equilibrium experiments were carried out at 5 ~ using an AN - D rotor at a speed of 3 , 000 rpm in 2 mM MES , pH 5 . 9 or 3 , 600 rpm in 2 mM MES , pH 5 . 9 , 3 M glycerol . Ultracentrifugal equilibrium was considered to have been attained when successive scans became invariant with time . Data were obtained by manually digitizing the scans and converting the X - Ycoordinates to concentration in the form of optical density at 280 nm as a function of radial position in the cell . These were analyzed by mathematical modeling by nonlinear least - squares curve - fitting using MLAB , an interactive system operating on a DEC - 10 computer ( see reference 23 for further details ) . The concentration as a function of radial position at equilibrium was considered to be Cr = E n Cb . i expAiMi ( r 2 - rb2 ) + e , i = l ( 3 ) where Cb . ~ ( i - 1 ) is the concentration of the ith solute , Cr is the total con - centration at any radial position r , M ~ is the molecular weight of the ith solute , A = ( 1 - vp ) to2 / 2R ' E , v is the partial specific volume of the protein , P is the solution density , to is the rotor angular velocity , R is the gas con - stant , T is the absolute temperature , and e is a small error term to adjust for baseline error . In this equation it is assumed that the partial specific vol - ume v is the same for all the species present , an approximation that is gener - ally considered to be valid in protein associating systems . Results Deep - Etch Electron Microscopy of 27S Clathrin Shallow etching of a suspension of 27S clathrin polymers in 2 mM MES buffer pH 5 . 9 yields various views of what ap - pear to be tetrahedra ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . These views include , most notably , equilateral triangles 33 nm on a side ( Fig . 2 , rows a - c ) . Tetrahedra would of course be composed of four such equilateral triangles . Also common are protruding tri - angular corners ( Fig . 1 ) and 33 - nm straight edges ( Fig . 2 , rowsfand h ) ; these appear to be partial views of tetrahedra . Finally , a number of forms look like fractured tetrahedra . These include straight edges with knobs at either end , and triangles with knobs at all three corners ( Fig . 2 , rows d , e , and g ) . The knobs appear to be the remnants of struts that linked the remaining structures with portions of tetrahedra that were fractured away . While these images were being produced , a report was published describing another small clathrin oligomer , a 42S species , that apparently forms a cube ( 26 ) . It thus became of interest to compare the two forms . Figs . 3 and 4 illustrate the deep - etch appearance of 42S clathrin in 12 % saturated ammonium sulfate before and after uranyl acetate fixation . The 27S and 42S species prove to have exactly the smrle edge - lengths ( when measured from the center of one vertex to the center of adjacent vertices ) , namely , 33 ran . They are clearly different , however , in that the 42S species invariably display square faces , whereas the 27S species invariably display tri - angular faces . Comparison of these forms with the native clathrin poly - mer offers additional perspective . Fig . 5 presents the deep - etch appearance of an in situ clathrin polymer , which is seen to be composed of hexagonal and pentagonal facets . Its com - posite " struts " are substantially thicker than those of the smaller species under study here ( 10 nm vs . 6 nm after cor - rection for 2 nm of platinum ) , and its vertices are separated by roughly half the distance found in the smaller species The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 105 , 1987 2000 Figure L Stereo views of 27S clathrin polymers suspended in 2 mM MES buffer , obtained by etching a quick - frozen so - lution relatively briefly ( 1 min rather than the usual 3 - - 4 min at - 100 ~ This lowered the ice table around the macro - molecules by some 50 nm , as compared to the usual ex - posure of 1 / 4 - 1 / 2 gm in " deep " etching . Bar , 33 nm . ( (cid:127)16 nm vs . * 33 nm ) . Isolated 8S clathrin triskelions , by comparison , have still thinner legs ( , x , 4 nm ) and display characteristic bends in their legs at ~ 16 nm from their ver - tices ( Figs . 2 and 4 , bottom corner panels ) . Several previous reports have shown that triskelions could fit neatly into the in situ hexagonal lattice ( 4 , 14 , 27 ) , but the fit into 27S tetra - hedra is not so obvious . Fig . 6 graphically illustrates the problem , by showing individual faces of 27S tetrahedra su - perimposed upon an in situ hexagonal lattice , both obtained by identically scaled camera lucida tracings of Figs . 2 and 5 . Note that vertices in the 27S tetrahedra coincide with nonadjacent vertices in the in situ lattice . The implications of this will be explained below . Further characterization of the 27S species was performed by adapting them to the mica adsorption / freeze - dry proce - dure used for the 42S species above . However , there was a problem here . The 27S form of clathrin failed to adhere to mica in very low ionic strengths , but promptly depolymer - ized when ionic strength was raised during mica exposure . Polylysine pretreatment of the mica increased its affinity for clathrin but caused the 27S polymers to come apart during adsorption , as happens also when normal clathrin baskets adsorb to polylysine mica ( 10 ) . To avoid this , 27S clathrin was prefixed in 40 mM glutaraldehyde ( in 2 mM MES pH 5 . 9 ) for 10 min at 4 ~ and then adsorbed to polylysine - treated mica . This yielded discrete structures on mica ( Figs . 7 and 8 ) , which , a first glance , look very little like tetrahedra . In - stead , they resemble smaU jeUyfish or medusae ( Fig . 8 , rows c and d ) or , in terms of their globules - connected - by - strands appearance , like the Bohr models of atomic electron shells ( Fig . 8 , rows a and b ) . Nevertheless , wherever their compo - nents are clear and non - overlapping , they can be seen to con - tain four globules , each connected to all the others by two slightly separated thin strands . When the four globules lie at the four corners of an imaginary square , two pairs of strands crisscross in the center to link them together ( thus creating the " atomic " images , Fig . 8 , row b ) . In other instances ( the " medusae " images ; cf . Fig . 8 , row d ) , three of the globules lie in a row and the fourth off to one side , its three pairs of strands radiating out in a bell - shape to join the others . These are in fact two of the many possible planar projections of a tetrahedron , assuming each of its vertices forms a globule and each of its edges splits in two during adsorption to mica . Indeed , the globules in question look similar to the vertices of single triskelions adsorbed to mica in low affinity condi - tions ( 10 , 15 ) , and the strands are the proper width and length to be single triskelion legs ( of . Figs . 2 and 4 , lower panel ) . Thus the images of 2 " / S clathrin flattened onto polylysine - mica are additional evidence that the tetrahedron is com - posed of four clathrin triskelia , one at each vertex , with their legs overlapping in antiparallel arrangement to create each of the tetrahedral edges . Very rarely , variants of this form with only three globules and six interconnecting strands are found in 27S preparations ( Fig . 8 , row e ) . The predominant tetrameric form is diagrammed in Fig . 9 . The obvious discrepancy between the present interpre - tation of the 27S species as a tetramer , versus the earlier equilibrium centrifugation data suggesting a hexamer ( 23 ) , mandated several control experiments to ensure that glutaral - dehyde fixation and adsorption to mica did not create tetra - mers artifactually . To avoid prefixation , we examined several 27S preparations that were exposed to 70 mM KCI for only a few seconds before exposure to mica ( the salt being pro - vided to restore micas affinity ) . This destabilized the tetra - hedra but did not always allow time for complete dissociation ( Figs . 10 and 11 ) . Most importantly , the few tetrahedra that remain intact in these preparations ( Fig . 10 , circled struc - tures ) look identical to those observed after fixation and adsorption to polylysine - mica . Furthermore , among the im - ages of partial dissociation are numerous examples of tetra - hedra with one or two strands sticking out ( Fig . 11 , row a ) . These show that each of the two strands that connect adjacent tetrahedral vertices is in fact a single triskelion leg . Also present are many examples of complete dissociation , in which Heuser et al . Deep - Etch Visualization of 27S Clathrin 2001 Figure 2 .

In a , the cubic form of these polymers is readily apparent , in spite of a thick layer of residual ammo - nium sulfate . In b , the salt has been washed away . This has also removed a large propor - tion of the cubes but has left the remaining ones much cleaner . Bar , 33 rim . Figure 4 . Gallery of different views of 42S clathrin polymers adsorbed to mica chips . Each column presents a slightly different view , epitomized by the drawings below ; clearly , all represent different views of 33 - nm cubes . The cubes are " clean " here because ammonium sulfate was washed away before quick - freezing , as in Fig . 3 ( lower panel ) . ( Curiously , this wash could not be done without provoking com - plete collapse of the cubes onto the mica , unless the mica was passed through 0 . 5 % uranyl acetate for 30 s before washing . Such " fixation " of the cubes also seemed to be mandatory in the previous study on cubes [ 26 ] . ) The cubes shown here differ from those in reference 26 in that they are not collapsed by air drying and hence look smaller , measuring only 33 nm on a side as opposed to the value of 45 nm in reference 26 . This brings them into line with the size of the tetrahedra shown above , and also with what would be expected from the actual length of a triskelion leg ( 10 , 15 ) .

These provide compelling evidence that the 27S species are tetramers , not hexamers .

These include examples of tetrahedra that have been only partially " melted " by contact with the polylysine mica , such that one vertex remains above the mica and displays three struts running down to the melted part ( Fig . 13 , row a ) . The elevated struts look thick and smooth , like those of sus - pended tetrahedra ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) , whereas the adsorbed por - tions look thinner and bipartite , like other collapsed species ( Figs . 7 and 8 ) . Other curious " intermediate " images were found in prepa - rations of 27S clathrin that were placed on untreated mica while still in 2 mM MES buffer . As mentioned above , clathrin does not adsorb to mica under these conditions ; but when etching is very deep , some tetrahedra are completely released from the ice and fall onto the mica during freeze - drying . Examples of such entities are shown in Fig . 13 ( row b ) . These are obviously smaller than tetrahedra that remain supported by ice ( Fig . 2 ) , and look more irregular ( like rai - sins compared to grapes ) , but they do display four distinct vertices with struts running among all of them , suggesting that they are tetrahedra that have collapsed internally . Further Biochemical Characterization of 27S Clathrin The earlier conclusion that 27S polymers are composed of six clathrin trimers was based on sedimentation equilibrium analysis ( 23 ) . However , the electron microscopic data shown here indicated that the physical studies had to be repeated . In the course of these new experiments we learned that the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 105 , 1987 2004 Figure 7 .

Bars , 33 nm . 27S polymer is stable in 2 mM MES , pH 5 . 9 , for at least 3 - - 4 wk at 4 ~ However , samples stored for this length of time do not dissociate completely into 8S species when pH is raised to 8 . 0 or 2 M urea is added . Instead they form two dis - tinctly sedimenting boundaries at 8 - 10S and 16 - 18S , with a concentration ratio of roughly 1 : 3 ( analytical ultracentrifu - gation data , not shown ) . This implies that some contacts are becoming fixed or clathrin is slowly denaturing in the low Figure 8 . Gallery of individual 27S clathrin tetrahedra after fixation and adsorption to mica ( as in Fig . 7 ) . Row a depicts examples with four particularly distinct globules in a square army ; row b depicts additional examples with near perfect radial symmetry and more clear - cut delineation of the 12 struts that interconnect the four globules ; rows c and d illustrate others that have collapsed differently , such that three of their globules are aligned while the fourth is off to the side , thus yielding " medusae " images . The four globules are relatively prominent in row c while the 12 interconnecting struts are relatively prominent in row d . ( Note that the patterns in a and b should result from tetrahedra striking the mica on one edge , while those in c and d should result from tetrahedra striking mica on one face ; cf . Fig . 10 . ) Row e depicts our entire collection of some very rare variants in these preparations , in which only three globules and six struts are present . These may be formed out of proteolysed triskelia ( cf . reference 10 ) . Bar , 33 nm . Heuser et al . Deep - Etch Visualization of 27S Clathrin 2005 Figure 9 . Diagram of the most likely way in which four clathrin triskelia could pucker their vertices and straighten their legs to form tetrahedra of the size found in 27S clathrin preparations . For sim - plicity , the terminal domains of the triskelial legs are omitted . Note that three of these terminal domains should come together under - neath each vertex . salt conditions . Whatever the process , its importance for the present study is that it apparently involves a concomitant aggregation of the 27S species , Upon review of our earlier centrifugation data , it became clear that our clathrin had un - dergone such changes and that much larger species were forming and spinning out during the , , ol wk centrifugation run . ( We found that similar irreversible changes occur when normal DOS clathrin cages are placed in 2 mM MES at pH 5 . 9 . After 2 d , they no longer dissociate completely into 8S species when pH is raised to 8 . 0 or 2 M urea is applied , but instead form two sedimenting boundaries , one correspond - ing to ~ 8S and the other , x , 40 - 70S , in about equal amounts . Figure 10 . Survey view of 27S clathrin species falling apart on mica , to illustrate that they are each formed from four triskelions . Partial dissociation was provoked here by transferring a 27S preparation from 2 mM MES buffer to 70 mM KC1 and 30 mM Hepes buffer pH 7 . 0 for 30 s before adsorption to mica . ( This was done in an at - tempt to overcome micas low affinity for clathrin in dilute solutions , but the dissociation shown here prompted the development of the alternative technique used for Figs . 7 and 8 ) .

Neither dithiothreitol [ DTT ] nor mercaptoethanol prevents the above " aging " change in low ionic strength , indicating it does not result from disulfide bond formation . ) From the above observations it seems clear that some sort of irreversible change in clathrin occurs in 2 mM MES , pH 5 . 9 . This does not occur at higher salt concentrations , but be - cause 27S clathrin falls apart in higher salt , we looked for other solvent conditions that would protect it . Glycerol was a prime candidate because it is known to stabilize proteins through preferential interaction with them ( 6 , 7 , 16 ) . When several concentrations of glycerol were tried , we found that 3 M glycerol permitted the continuing existence of both the 27S species and 150S baskets in 2 mM MES , pH 5 . 9 , yet al - lowed them to dissociate completely into 8S clathrin even af - ter 4 wk of storage at 4 ~ We took advantage of this to im - prove our molecular weight determination , by carrying out centrifugation in 3 M glycerol . Fig . 14 displays the sedimentation equilibrium pattern of 27S species in 2 mM MES ( pH 5 . 9 ) with 3 M glycerol . The line is a best fit curve for a one - component analysis , giving a molecular weight of 2 . 26 x 106 . The root mean square error for the fit was 0 . 006 . Assuming a triskelion molecular weight of 630 , 000 , this gives 3 . 6 triskelions per each 27S polymer . A second experiment under similar conditions , also with glycerol , gave a molecule weight corresponding to 3 . 8 triskelions . These data thus support the above electron microscopic evidence that the 27S species is a tetramer of triskelions . Since the curves indicate a single component , we made no attempt to analyze the data as a multicomponent system and thus to evaluate additional thermodynamic parameters , as we did in our earlier report ( 23 ) . Finally , we carried out light scattering experiments using Eq . 1 and 2 in the Materials and Methods to obtain an inde - pendent estimate of the molecular weight of the 27S species . To do this , a fresh solution of 27S clathrin in 2 mM MES , pH 5 . 9 at 0 . 1 mg / ml was titrated gradually to pH 8 . 0 with a concentrated solution of NaOH and light scatter values ( Ir2 / lo ) were measured under both conditions . ( We verified that these 27S species dissociated completely at pH 8 . 0 by analyzing the products in the analytical ultracentrifuge . ) Blank values of the scatter for buffer alone were measured and subtracted at each pH . Three independent experiments gave scattering values of 76 , 80 , and 92 for the 27S polymer and 20 , 22 , and 26 , for the 8S protomer , respectively . Since Figure 13 .

Equilibrium centrifugation pattern of 275 clathrin poly - mers in 2 mM MES pH 5 . 9 , 3 M glycerol . The line represents the fit of the data for a single component ( cf . reference 23 ) . the buffer conditions did not significantly change over this range of pHs , the H parameter could be assumed to be the same for both 27S and 8S forms ( Eq . 2 ) . Also , both forms are of comparable dimensions and much smaller than the wavelength of light used , and since both of them are fairly asymmetric , we assumed that P ( O ) term did not vary sig - nificantly either . Finally , the experimental design ensured that the concentration term C for 27S and 8S forms stayed constant . Thus , from Eq . 1 we see that the relative ratio of their scattering values should indicate directly the ratio of their molecular weights . The above experimental values gave a ratio of 3 . 65 + 0 . 20 , again indicating that the 27S polymer is a tetramer of clathrin . Discussion Interpreting Images of Polymers in Suspension The most likely interpretation of our images of 27S clathrin is that it forms a tetrahedron . Freeze - etching of 27S species in suspension has revealed various facets of what are clearly small , closed structures partially embedded in ice . Protrud - ing from the ice are various views of faces that are invariably triangular and vertices that are invariably formed by the con - vergence of three struts . Tetrahedra are the only likely struc - tures to generate such images ( cf . Fig . 9 ) . Interpreting Images of 27S Clathrin on Mica Unfortunately , 27S clathrin adsorbed to mica did not yield such definitive images . Unfixed tetrahedra fell apart com - pletely on mica and glutaraldehyde - fixed ones collapsed in - ternally during adsorption . Thereafter they looked some - what like flattened projections of tetrahedra , but displayed certain differences that deserve mention . First , the flattened specimens invariably displayed four distinct globules that were not visible anywhere on tetrahedra in suspension . We imagine that these represent structures that were originally present inside the tetrahedron , hence invisible on metal replicas of their outsides . ( Due to " self - shadowing " prob - lems , evaporatively deposited metal rarely delineates any - thing down inside the openings of clathrin lattices , whether in situ or in vitro 8 , 10 . ) The most likely candidates for such internal structures are the scroll - shaped " terminal domains " of the clathrin legs , which point inward in normal clathrin cages ( I0 , 29 , 30 ) . Since each clathrin leg measures 45 - 50 nm in toto ( 10 ) , while the struts in the tetrahedra measure only " , , 33 nm , quite a bit of each leg could be directed inward in them , as well . Indeed , the distance from any vertex to the very center of a tetrahedron is 0 . 55x the edge length ( or 18 nm in these species ) , so if the remaining portions of each leg did radiate inward from each of the four vertices , they could probably touch each other in the center . Moreover , each vertex should represent the convergence of three termi - nal domains . Together , these would certainly provide enough mass to generate the large globules seen in collapsed tetra - hedra . A second discrepancy between adsorbed and suspended 27S clathrin is that the component struts in the latter are rela - tively smooth and display no hint of their supposed bipartite composition ( e . g . , two antiparallel triskelion legs ; cf . Fig . 9 ) . We presume that this is a problem resulting from the limited resolution of platinum replication in general . Repli - cas also fail to display any hint of the complicated overlap of four triskelion legs that ought to be present in the normal clathrin lattice ( 8 , 10 ) , and also give no hint of clathrin light chain presence or location ( 15 ) . Only when a polymers com - ponent parts are torn apart during adsorption to mica and de - posited at a slight distance from each other do they become resolvable in metal replicas . For instance , such separation here demonstrates that 27S tetrahedra are composed of four triskelions , by clearly revealing four sets of triskelion com - ponents ( four globular vertices and 12 , i . e . , four sets of three , interdigitated legs ) . The relative dimensions of tetrahedra versus their compo - nent parts indicate that their four triskelia are probably in the straight - legged and highly " puckered " conformation dia - grammed in Fig . 9 . This differs in several respects from the ar - rangement postulated for normal clathrin baskets ( 4 , 14 , 27 ) . In the normal basket , adjacent vertices are ~ , 15 nm apart ( 5 , 8 , 12 , 22 ) , less than half the length of one triskelion leg , while in tetrahedra they are 33 nm apart . Isolated triskelia display distinct " kinks " at ~ 16 nm along each leg , marking the point at which each leg passes the adjacent vertex in the in situ cage and goes on to a second side ( 4 , 10 , 14 , 15 , 27 ) . In tetrahedra , on the other hand , these " kinks " seem to be straightened out , since the vertices are separated by nearly twice this distance . Moreover , in tetrahedra the struts sepa - rate into only two legs upon adsorption to mica , while four legs overlap in each strut of a normal clathrin basket . Hence the correspondence in size between tetrahedra facets and basket facets shown in Fig . 6 can be misleading , in that one contains only half as many clathrin " building blocks " as the other . Furthermore , the three legs of each triskelion in a hex - agonal basketwork are thought to radiate out from each ver - tex in one plane ( when the network is completely flat as in the central portion of Fig . 5 ) or at most in a gentle " pucker " of some 15 ~ off the plane ( in more curved baskets like the icosahedral shells around brain coated vesicles ; cf . refer - ences 10 and 14 ) . In contrast , the triskelions in tetrabedra must be sharply puckered , each leg some 75 ~ off of a plane The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 105 , 1987 2008 through the tetrahedral vertex . It would seem that a relatively flat , bent - legged 8S triskelion becomes converted , by the unique form of self - association that develops in very low ionic strength , into a very differently shaped entity , e . g . , one that is highly puckered and straight - legged . This is the same transformation that has been postulated to occur during for - mation of the cubic 42S polymer ( 26 ) . Thus the 27S and 42S polymers of clathrin represent a re - markably similar pattern of assembly , even though one in - volves four triskelia and the other eight , and one forms in unusually low ionic strength while the other forms in un - usually high ionic strength . In our previous description of 27S species ( 23 ) , the incor - rect notion that they represented hexamers led to speculation that they might be intermediates in the assembly of normal cages , i . e . , individual hexagonal " facets " like those found in normal in situ clathrin lattices . This would have fit with the prevailing view that the normal lattice contains one triskelion at each of the six vertices that form its hexagons ( 4 , 14 , 27 ) . The problem with this view , however , is that deep - etched 27S species turn out to look like closed structures , while earlier workers have illustrated that fragments of baskets ought to be open structures bristling with uncommitted clathrin legs that can go on to overlap extensively with others in a com - pleted network ( 4 ) . We thus feel now that the entities under scrutiny here are probably not intermediates in normal clathrin lattice assembly . Since they only form in very unnat - ural ionic conditions , they are probably not related to any normal storage form of clathrin in the cytoplasm either , but that remains to be determined .
