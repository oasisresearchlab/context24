BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 Introduction Australia’s COVID - 19 strategy has changed markedly over 2020 – 2022 . Starting from an extended period where tight border controls , contact tracing and lockdowns were used to eliminate community COVID - 19 trans - mission , in mid - 2021 and as vaccines became available , public health restrictions were instead used to main - tain health system capacity by controlling disease rather than eliminating community transmission . In the state of Victoria , Australia , the government used epidemiologi - cal modelling extensively over this period to assess the health - related outcomes of potential policies . Model out - comes were used to complement information from other sources including analysis of epidemiological data , eco - nomic forecasting , international experience and expert opinion to inform decision - making on COVID - 19 policy responses . Australia’s first wave of COVID - 19 was mainly driven by imported infections from international travel [ 1 ] . All Australian States and Territories implemented lock - downs , which stopped local transmission and led to local elimination of COVID - 19 ( ‘COVID - zero’ ) by June 2020 in seven of eight jurisdictions . This initial success shaped Australia’s COVID - 19 pre - vaccination phase policies . Victoria was the only exception to this initial achieve - ment of COVID - zero , experiencing an outbreak of the wild - type variant from June - November 2020 . This out - break comprised distinct periods of epidemic growth ( June - August ) where a sequence of public health restric - tions were introduced to control it , and epidemic decline ( August - November ) where restrictions were incre - mentally eased as case numbers decreased . During this period , key policy questions centred around how to relax restrictions without epidemic resurgence . Following this outbreak , community COVID - 19 transmission was elim - inated from Victoria [ 2 ] . Between November 2020 and July 2021 , Victoria con - tinued to eliminate community COVID - 19 transmis - sion through international travel restrictions , hotel quarantine of international arrivals , and reactive city or state - wide lockdowns to assist intense contact trac - ing following incursions into the community . Relatively brief lockdowns were implemented on three occasions following such incursions . Decisions around the scale of the response for each outbreak had to be made follow - ing only a small number of detected cases and based on an incomplete understanding of how much transmis - sion had already occurred . Key questions during this time focused on how quickly restrictions needed to be imposed , the duration of restrictions , and level of restric - tions needed to contain outbreaks . Between July 2021 and November 2021 , Victoria expe - rienced an outbreak of the more infectious Delta variant that continued to grow despite extensive lockdowns and public health measures in place . In parallel , vaccine availability was increasing , prompting a transition in COVID - 19 strategy from an aim of eliminating commu - nity transmission to an aim of slowing the spread until high population - level vaccine protection was established [ 3 ] . The context of a simultaneous growing epidemic , increasing vaccine coverage and change in COVID - 19 strategy required the development of a roadmap for eas - ing restrictions . The key questions during this phase of the outbreak centred around the interaction between restrictions and vaccine coverage , and ensuring that health system demand did not exceed capacity . By December 2021 , over 90 % two - dose vaccine cov - erage among people over 16 years had been reached in Victoria and transmission of the Delta variant appeared to be stable in the community with minimal restrictions in place [ 4 ] . Subsequently , the emergence of the Omicron variant triggered a large epidemic wave , the management of which is still ongoing . Throughout these different epidemic stages , our mod - elling team worked closely with the Victorian govern - ment to conduct analyses to estimate COVID - 19 - related outcomes from different policy options . In this paper we present a selection of analyses that were conducted at different stages of the pandemic and describe how the modelling was used to inform decision - making at critical times . This is useful to understand the circumstances and ways in which modelling can be most valuable for policy making . Methods Model overview We used an established agent - based microsimulation model , Covasim [ 5 , 6 ] , developed by the Institute for Disease Modelling ( USA ) and collaborators including the Burnet Institute , to model epidemics in Melbourne [ 6 – 8 ] . The model is open source and available online [ 9 ] . In brief , agents in the model are assigned an age ( which affects their susceptibility to infection and disease prog - nosis ) , a household , a school ( for people aged 5 – 17 ) or a workplace ( for people over 18 , up to 65 ) , and they par - ticipate in a number of community activities that may include attending restaurants , pubs , places of worship , community sport , and small social gatherings . Details of included contact types , network structures , transmission dynamics and disease outcomes in the latest model ver - sion are provided in the supplement , though the model was continually adapted as analysis questions changed to enable scenario analysis of settings or policies relevant for critical decisions , and so not all features were used for all analyses presented in this paper . Page 3 of 12 Scott et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 Interventions The model includes vaccination ( including individual dosing schedules , vaccine types and waning immu - nity ) , testing ( PCR or rapid antigen tests ) , contact tracing ( with probability of tracing contacts depending on the setting the contact occurs , the capacity of the system and the tracing policy at the time ) , quarantine of close contacts , isolation of confirmed cases , masks , and a variety of policy restrictions to prevent or reduce transmission in different settings ( e . g . closing schools or workplaces , density limits in hospitality and retail settings , restrictions on social gathering sizes ) . Further details are provided in the supplement . Calibration and SARS‑CoV‑2 variants Model parameters for transmission and testing were continually calibrated and adjusted to fit data on daily new detected cases , hospital demand and ICU demand for each new analysis and variant . For the wild - type variant , this was based on calibration to data over the June - November 2020 epidemic wave . For the Alpha and Kappa variants , this was based on international literature and data on the relative transmissibility and severity compared with the wild - type variant ( since there were no major outbreaks in Australia ) . For the Delta variant this was based on calibration to data over the Aug - Sep 2021 epidemic wave . Scenario types As the epidemic progressed , the types of scenarios examined changed along with the policies under con - sideration and key questions . Four representative scenario types were retrospectively identified for pres - entation in this paper ( Table 1 ) . Scenario type 1 : prospective outbreak analyses ( elimination strategy context ) The model was initialized with no cases , public health settings were varied , and one or more incursions were simulated . The model was stochastic so onward transmis - sion did not occur in every simulation , but where trans - mission did occur , it could lead to case detection through symptomatic testing or surveillance testing interventions . After detection , policy options could be triggered to con - tain the outbreak . The main objective was to assess how different public health settings balanced the intensity and duration of restrictions against the risk of the outbreak growing out of control . The principal output measure was the percentage of simulations where the epidemic reached different sizes over a fixed period ( e . g . , 90 days ) . Simulations were often categorized as no cases detected ; some cases detected but the virus eventually eliminated ; or the 7 - day average daily detected cases reaching different threshold levels by the end of the model simulation . Scenario type 2 : reactive outbreak analyses ( elimination strategy context ) Outbreak analyses were calibrated to replicate outbreak characteristics at the analysis date . Simulations were sampled and rejected if they were not within + / - 10 % of the cumulative detected cases . Similarly , model simula - tions could be filtered to include only those where par - ticular numbers of ‘mystery cases’ ( diagnosed cases for which modelled contract tracing could not find a trans - mission source ) were detected . This filtered set of model simulations were conditioned on the observed state of outbreak so far , and were used to generate projections for the impact of prospective interventions . This meant that when an outbreak had begun with a series of ‘unlucky’ events at the start ( such as chain of superspreading events ) , that could be captured in the model . Table 1 Representative scenario types presented in this paper Scenario type Outcomes Context Calibration Prospective outbreak • Probability of outbreak growing under different theoretical circumstances No community cases ; elimination strategy No parameter fitting , sensitivity analyses for key parameters Reactive outbreak • Probability of existing outbreak reaching different levels or being eliminated • Time required to contain outbreak Small number of diagnosed cases fol‑ lowing period of no community cases ; elimination strategy No parameter fitting , filter outbreaks to match observed Easing restrictions • Timing and magnitude of epidemic peak• Probability of resurgence following eas‑ ing of restrictions Large number of cases ; elimination strategy Fit model to cases / hospital demand / deaths Managing health system utilization • Timing and magnitude of epidemic peak ( s ) • Peak hospital / ICU demand • Number of deaths Large number of cases ; epidemic control strategy Page 4 of 12 Scott et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 As with the prospective outbreak analyses , the main output measure was the percentage of simulations reach - ing different categories of 7 - day average daily detected cases and key questions focused on the duration of restrictions required to contain the outbreak . Scenario type 3 : easing restrictions ( elimination strategy context ) For situations where a large outbreak had occurred and restrictions had already been imposed , policy questions arose about when to ease restrictions and whether to do it incrementally or collectively . Model scenarios were calibrated analogously to the constrained outbreak analy - ses , where the model was initialized with a small num - ber of cases and simulations were only retained if they were consistent with the actual outbreak , accounting for restrictions imposed to date . Using only the retained sim - ulations , scenarios were run comparing outcomes with restrictions in place for different periods . The main outcome measure was the probability of reaching > N diagnoses per day following the easing of restrictions ( i . e . , “resurgence risk” ) , and how this varied according to the timing and extent that restrictions were eased . Scenario type 4 : health system utilization ( control strategy context ) As the broader COVID - 19 strategy transitioned from elimination to control , health system utilization became increasingly relevant . Scenarios were calibrated similarly to the easing restrictions analyses , and compared the impact of dynamically introducing or easing restrictions in the context of higher case numbers . The key outcome measures were hospital and ICU demand rather than the number of cases . Results An overview of overarching strategy and when principal scenario types were used is shown in Fig . 1 , overlaid on case numbers and vaccine coverage for epidemic context . Easing restrictions example : wild‑type epidemic wave , leading to elimination ( September 2020 ) Following a wild - type epidemic wave in Victoria ( June - Nov 2020 ) that was contained by imposing restrictions , an analysis was conducted on 14 September to assess the impact of the timing of easing restrictions on resur - gence risk ( Fig . 2 ) [ 8 ] . Model calibration involved running simulations starting from zero cases , sampling over ini - tial seed infections ( i . e . who in the model is the first case ) and uncertainty ranges of calibrated transmission param - eters , and retaining simulations within a threshold of the case data ( Fig . 2 , grey lines ) . For a set of 1000 retained simulations , scenarios were applied to a short - term pro - jection to compare the impact of easing restrictions on different dates . The red and blue lines in Fig . 2 show individual simulations for each restriction scenario , high - lighting the broad range of outcomes possible . For each scenario , a proportion of simulations trend to zero while a proportion result in a resurgence of infections , defined as reaching a threshold of daily diagnoses . This analysis showed that an additional two weeks of restrictions could Fig . 1 Victorian COVID‑19 timeline . New daily cases and vaccine coverage are shown over time , contextualising the overall strategic phase ( elimination or suppression ) and the dominant scenario type being run at different stages of the pandemic ( vertical shaded regions ) Page 5 of 12 Scott et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 more than halve the risk of a resurgence in cases . Factor - ing this and other evidence , restrictions were maintained and cases continued to decline , before being gradually eased from 28 September ( e . g . small gatherings of five people outdoors ) . Prospective outbreak analysis example ( October 2020 ) After the incidence of community acquired cases returned to zero from 29 to 2020 , outbreak risks from potential incursions were assessed . Simulations started with one undiagnosed case . The outbreak risk was defined as the percentage of simulations that reached a particular 7 - day average diagnosis threshold within 90 days of the start of the simulation ( e . g . > 30 in Fig . 3 ) . All simulations included contact tracing ( including second - ring tracing for some contacts ) . Several factors were identified that influenced out - break risk including the infectiousness of the variant , the number of generations of transmissions before the first detected case , and the policy response to the ini - tial case detection . The number of infection generations prior to the first diagnosis being recorded was particu - larly predictive of the outcome . In simulations where the index case was the first identified , light restriction con - tained the outbreak 94 % of the time ( Fig . 3 ) . However , if the index case was not the first case detected , this made Fig . 2 Wild‑type epidemic wave in Victoria in 2020 , in the context of an elimination COVID‑19 strategy , with scenarios considering resurgence risk if restrictions were eased on 14 Sep ( red ) or 28 Sep ( blue ) . Model simulations were started with random infected seed cases and randomly sampled transmission parameters , and were retained if they were within sufficient bounds of the observed data . Throughout the simulations ‘Stage 3’ , masks and ‘Stage 4’ restrictions were imposed , with their impact derived through model calibration ( see [ 8 ] ) Fig . 3 Outbreak analysis in Victoria in 2021 , in the context of pursuing an elimination strategy . Simulations were run starting from zero cases and a randomly infected seed case . Table shows the proportion of simulations where an outbreak occurred ( defined as reaching a 7‑day average of > 30 diagnoses / day within 90 days ) , according to which infection generation was detected , the infectiousness of the virus ( baseline = wild type ; 50 % more infectious ~ Alpha variant ) and what responses were implemented on detection of the first case ( light = masks and limits on social gatherings ; moderate = light + density limits ; heavy = lockdown ) Page 6 of 12 Scott et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 containment much more difficult . At the time of analysis , the Alpha variant was estimated to be 50 % more infec - tious than the wild type variant [ 10 , 11 ] , and in simula - tions where an Alpha variant infection was identified in the community and the index case was not the first case diagnosed , then even a moderate response ( mask man - dates , limits on social gatherings , and density limits ) would be unlikely to contain it ( Fig . 3 ) . These analyses highlighted the importance of interventions to increase case detection ( e . g . , asymptomatic screening of quaran - tine hotel workers ) . The impact of the timing of the response to an outbreak was also assessed . For early variants ( wild - type , Alpha ) , heavy restrictions were always able to contain outbreaks , but a delay in introducing restrictions increased the dura - tion of restrictions to contain the outbreak ( Fig . 4 ) . The analysis showed that if some restrictions were already active at the time of the incursion , the duration of restric - tions would also be shorter . This supported a “go hard go early” approach to restric - tions in the elimination context , which was applied when lockdowns were imposed from 13 to 17 February 2021 after 13 Alpha variant cases were detected , from 28 May to 3 June 2021 ( later extended to 10 June ) after 30 Kappa variant cases were detected , and from 16 July to 20 July ( later extended to 27 July ) after 18 Delta variant cases were detected . After each lockdown restrictions were incrementally eased , rather than lifted at once . Reactive outbreak analysis example : Kappa variant outbreak ( May 2021 ) Once an incursion was detected , outbreak risk esti - mates were refined by incorporating characterisations of the first few diagnoses . In May 2021 an outbreak of the Kappa variant occurred , with the first diagnosis on 24 May , and 45 and 58 cases were diagnosed cumulatively within the next 7 and 10 days , respectively . Mandatory masks were imposed on the first day , and a lockdown was imposed on the third day . Modelling was used to estimate the duration of the lockdown needed to contain the outbreak . Simulations started with a single case and were retained if transmis - sion occurred ( i . e . , the incursion did not fizzle out ) , the index case was never diagnosed , and there were between 43 and 65 diagnoses after 7 days and 53 – 80 diagnoses after 12 days . Using 1000 simulations that met these criteria ( sampling over initial seeds , contact network structures and transmission parameters ) , scenarios were run for policy changes under consideration , where after two weeks of lockdown ( June 11 ) , either the lockdown was maintained , or restrictions were eased by : opening schools only ; opening schools and venues with density limit ; opening schools , venues with density limits and allowing small social gatherings ; or returning to masks only . The impact of these policy changes on daily diag - noses four weeks after implementation was recorded as the main outcome measure ( Fig . 5 ) . The analysis quanti - fied how much the risk of a resurgence increased when restrictions were eased more generously , and enabled resurgence risk to be incorporated into decision - making alongside the costs associated with the lockdown . Based on this and other evidence , from 11 June schools were re - opened , hospitality was reopened with den - sity limits , small gatherings were allowed but only out - doors , and work from home and mask mandates were maintained .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 Prospective outbreak analysis example : context of vaccine rollout and coverage ( March 2021 ) When vaccination coverage increased , other public health responses were also expected to change . In the context of vaccines becoming available , outbreak risk ( defined as the percentage of simulations reaching dif - ferent diagnosis thresholds over the first 90 days after a single case ) was assessed by vaccine type and coverage ( Fig . 6 ) . While outbreak risk reduced with increasing vac - cine coverage , it was clear that herd immunity through vaccination was unlikely to be achieved , supporting an eventual move from an elimination strategy to a control strategy . Managing health system utilization example : moving from elimination to control ( July 2021 ) Later we investigated the feasibility of a range of possi - ble control strategies , from intermittent restrictions to removal of all non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) [ 12 , 13 ] . Since vaccines were highly efficacious but imper - fect , removing all NPIs was found to come at consider - able health cost ( Fig . 7 ) . This analysis showed that with the Delta variant , intermittent low - level restrictions ( for example , high levels of testing , mask mandates and work from home ) could potentially reduce COVID - 19 - related mortality to a similar rate as experienced in the 2017 influenza season ( a year with particularly high influenza - related mortality ) , depending on vaccine efficacy . In addition , a trade - off was identified between the degree of restrictions and the duration , where similar case num - bers could be achieved with a short duration of strict restrictions , or longer duration of light restrictions . This showed that even with high vaccine coverage , without NPIs the health impacts of COVID - 19 would be much worse than influenza , but that intermittent light restric - tions could considerably improve outcomes . Managing health system utilization example : Delta variant epidemic wave ( Sept 2021 ) Prior to the Delta variant , NPIs were sufficient to contain outbreaks in unvaccinated populations . However , in mid - 2021 Victoria experienced a large Delta variant epidemic wave before high coverage of vaccination was achieved ( as of 5 August only 43 % of Victorians over 16 years had received one dose and 21 % two doses ) . With the Delta variant having a shorter serial interval that reduced the effectiveness of contact tracing , and community fatigue leading to declining compliance with restrictions , Fig . 5 Outbreak analysis in Victoria in 2021 , when an outbreak has been detected but limited information is known , pursuing an elimination strategy . Top : Simulations were run starting from zero cases and a randomly infected seed case . Simulations were only retained if they produced , through stochastic variation , approximately the same initial outbreaks as occurred . In this example it was 43 – 65 diagnoses within 7 days of the first diagnosis , and 53 – 80 diagnoses within 12 days of the first diagnosis . This is against a background of masks and work from home if possible being implemented on day 1 , and lockdown being implemented on day 3 . Bottom : From the retained simulations , scenarios compared whether the lockdown was maintained , or after 14 days either schools were reopened , venues were opened with density limits , small social gatherings were also allowed , or a return to masks and working from home only Page 8 of 12 Scott et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 community transmission continued to increase despite a lockdown being imposed . Plans to transition away from an elimination approach were accelerated , with a focus on using NPIs to control the epidemic while conducting a mass vaccination campaign . Modelling was used to assess the implications of different strategies ( i . e . , sequences and timings of restrictions being eased , relative to the vaccination rollout and case numbers ) on infections and health system demand [ 14 , 15 ] . This analysis showed that maintaining testing among those vaccinated was likely to be necessary for limiting transmission , and early actions to achieve transmission reduction could have significant downstream implications due to rising vaccine cover - age ( Fig . 8 ) . The roadmap that was developed ultimately included incremental easing of restrictions in line with different vaccination coverage thresholds . Discussion After Australia’s initial response successfully eliminated community COVID - 19 transmission from most jurisdic - tions in early 2020 , and as the dire health consequences of widespread transmission in the absence of a vaccine were observed internationally , Australia embarked on a phase lasting until mid - 2021 where similar catastrophic health outcomes were avoided by using tight border controls , contact tracing and restrictions to achieve and maintain the elimination of community transmission . During this phase , community incursions from hotel quarantine reg - ularly occurred , and modelling was used as a critical tool to understand outbreak risks and how they varied in dif - ferent circumstances or with different responses . In the elimination phase , model outputs showed out - break risk depended on whether the detected case was the incursion , first ring of infections or a ‘mystery case’ . There were benefits of early lockdown on detection of the first case and exiting lockdowns slowly through gradual easing of restrictions to minimise resurgence risk from undetected cases . Key metrics in this period were the number of cases , the intensity of restrictions , and the duration of restrictions , as returning to COVID - zero was viewed as the most efficient way to meet other targets . The emergence of COVID - 19 vaccines meant that catastrophic health outcomes could be avoided with - out the need for some of the stricter border control and lockdown measures . This , combined with the fact that the elimination of community transmission was no longer realistic due to the emergence of more infectious variants , led to a move from an elimination to a control strategy . While high vaccine coverage was an essential element , our analyses indicated that sustainable con - trol strategies would require vaccines plus intermittent ‘light’ restrictions , introduced early in times of case number escalation , to avoid excess case and health sys - tem demand escalation . During the critical transition Fig . 6 Outbreak analysis in Victoria in 2021 , over 90 days starting from a single case and different levels of population vaccine coverage . Left : AstraZeneca type vaccine , with assumed protection against infection of 50 % , and protection against symptomatic disease of 65 % . Right : Pfizer type vaccines , with assumed protection against infection of 80 % , and protection against symptomatic disease of 90 % . TPOD = total protection against disease ; POI = protection against infection . Note that vaccine efficacy estimates were based on best available data as at March 2021 Page 9 of 12 Scott et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 period from an elimination to a control strategy , and as vaccine coverage increased , the focus of analyses shifted to health system demand , with case numbers becoming less important . In all analyses conducted , model evidence was most crucial for decision making when used to investigate questions that could not be answered in any other way . For example , where relevant data was available , direct analysis was significantly faster to inform decisions and required fewer assumptions to be made . Model analy - ses were therefore typically used to support decisions that needed to be made pre - emptively ( e . g . , how long to lockdown for , when minimal information was available ) [ 16 ] . Since the primary aims of each study could not be answered directly with data , this meant that the ration - ale for the use of modelling was always clear . The utility of modelling was also increased by the co - design of scenarios with government and other relevant stakeholders [ 16 ] . Scenarios were only modelled if ( a ) they could not be shown to be superior / inferior based on existing data ; ( b ) they were considered reasonable by epidemiologists and public health teams ; and ( c ) they were being seriously considered by government given other economic , social , and political implications . Many policy options could be ruled out before even making it to the modelling stage , because they were not likely to be feasible for other reasons . For example , working with stakeholders ensured that scenarios could incorporate Fig . 7 Projected COVID‑19 deaths in Victoria over a 12‑month period under different outbreak response scenarios , triggered by case numbers ( left ) , and average time spent under restrictions ( right ) . Top : Grey bars show the projected number of deaths on a log scale , with the lighter shading indicating the proportion that are among the vaccinated population . Scenarios are based on 95 % / 70 % / 70 % vaccine coverage being achieved among people aged 60 + / 12 – 59 / < 12 years , the vaccine having an assumed 80 % protection against infection and 92 % protection against death , and 5 cases per day were seeded into the community through reduced quarantine measures . Light restrictions = mandatory masks , density limits and work from home if possible ; medium restriction = light restrictions + additional limits on gathering sizes ; lockdown = mandatory masks , work from home , schools closed , retail closed , hospitality take‑away only , social gatherings up to two outdoors only . Bottom : example time series output from one simulation , where increasing restrictions are triggered with increased hospital number thresholds , to maintain disease control Page 10 of 12 Scott et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 operational or capacity constraints in the delivery of ser - vices such as testing or vaccination . Co - designing the scenarios also helped align model outputs with other evidence under consideration , to make the modelling as informative as possible . For example , running epidemic projections for similar scenarios to those separately used for economic forecasts facilitates integrating both sources of evidence . In addition , the continued involve - ment of the modelling team with public health teams allowed ongoing refinement and improvement of the modelling , and validation against past accuracy . There were many challenges associated with the need for fast decision - making . Ideally , modelling analyses would undergo peer review before being used to inform decisions . The purpose of the peer - review process is to ensure that model design , assumptions and inputs are fit - for - purpose , consistent with best practice , and incorporate the latest evidence . However , in the case of an outbreak , decisions often need to be made quickly , with significant impacts on the lives of large numbers of people . It is therefore imprac - tical to have outputs peer - reviewed in advance , which can take months . Review and validation of raw model outputs by government analysts on standby was conducted in place of such checks , and where feasible identical requests were often put to other modelling groups [ 17 , 18 ] to be con - ducted simultaneously and independently [ 19 , 20 ] . Detailing how these analyses were conducted is impor - tant because the role of modelling in informing policy is not well understood . Epidemiological modelling is a spe - cialized discipline that experienced increased media atten - tion because of its utility to generate evidence to support decision - making in the COVID - 19 pandemic ; however , it is often not communicated well through the media [ 19 ] . There are common misconceptions about the differences Fig . 8 2021 roadmap with reduced testing for people vaccinated ( blue ) , maintained testing for people vaccinated ( red ) , and an additional 15 % reduction in non‑household transmission ( green ) . Scenarios include schools returning to in person learning throughout October ; childcare returning and mobility restrictions easing in October ; limited outdoor gatherings at 70 % two‑dose vaccine coverage among people 16 + years ; indoor gathering with density limits at 80 % two‑dose coverage among people 16 + years and mandatory vaccine requirements . Dashed vertical lines represent estimated dates of reaching 70 % and 80 % two‑dose coverage among people 16 + years Page 11 of 12 Scott et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 988 between forecasting ( trying to predict the specific course of the epidemic ) and scenario analyses ( comparing projec - tions under different policy options to estimate the impact of policies and inform decisions ) [ 21 ] . This often results in a dichotomisation of modelling being viewed by the public as being right or wrong , with many of the key insights gen - erated by the analyses being missed . This is compounded by the presence of uncertainty at multiple levels , including in data , model parameters , and stochastic model outputs . Communicating uncertainty and confidence is challeng - ing , but critical to interpreting model findings . A strength of modelling that can be difficult to communicate is that even in the presence of high uncertainty in forward epi - demic projections , there may be low uncertainty in what is a superior intervention or policy option [ 21 ] . There are many limitations in the use of modelling to inform COVID - 19 decisions . First , models are simplifica - tions of the real world and cannot capture the full range of human behaviour . Second , there are many things that are unknown about COVID - 19 disease dynamics , that models must approximate with the evolving results of clinical trials and observational studies . Third , parame - ters continue to change over time . As evidence for model inputs like vaccine efficacy or human behaviour become clearer over time as more data becomes available , results change and this can make analyses done at different times appear to be contradictory . Fourth , compro - mises are required to constrain levels of detail in order to meet timelines for when decisions need to be made . Finally , epidemiological models typically only focus on health outcomes ( and sometimes health - related costs ) . Government decisions have repercussions throughout the community for a wide range of stakeholders , and policy decisions must necessarily account for factors not included in the model . It is important that model analyses acknowledge this and avoid making policy recommenda - tions outside of their ability to meet specific health tar - gets . Overall , greater transparency around modelling and how it was used would help to educate the community , media and governments more broadly on the strengths and limitations of these analyses , and the ways in which modelling is ( and is not ) used in decision making . Conclusion Model evidence offers the greatest value to support COVID - 19 decision making when decisions need to be made pre - emptively , or to answer questions that cannot be answered with data analysis alone . Models need to adapt to evolving COVID - 19 strategies and should have scenarios and outcome metrics co - designed with policy - makers and other stakeholders . Epidemiological models cannot cover all outcomes from policy changes , particu - larly when timelines for decision - making are short , and must be used in conjunction with other information sources to make policy decisions .
