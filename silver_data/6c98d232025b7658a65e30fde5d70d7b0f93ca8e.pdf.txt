Ansermet , CH - 1211 Geneva , Switzerland Communicated by Ruth Lehmann , New York University Medical Center , New York , NY , December 28 , 2006 ( received for review October 10 , 2006 ) Germ - line transformation via transposable elements is a powerful tool to study gene function in Drosophila melanogaster . However , some inherent characteristics of transposon - mediated transgenesis limit its use for transgene analysis . Here , we circumvent these limi - tations by optimizing a (cid:1) C31 - based integration system . We gener - ated a collection of lines with precisely mapped attP sites that allow the insertion of transgenes into many different predetermined inter - genic locations throughout the ﬂy genome . By using regulatory elements of the nanos and vasa genes , we established endogenous sources of the (cid:1) C31 integrase , eliminating the difﬁculties of coinject - ing integrase mRNA and raising the transformation efﬁciency . More - over , to discriminate between speciﬁc and rare nonspeciﬁc integra - tionevents , a white gene - basedreconstitutionsystemwasgenerated that enables visual selection for precise attP targeting . Finally , we demonstrate that our chromosomal attP sites can be modiﬁed in situ , extendingtheirscopewhileretainingtheirpropertiesaslandingsites . The efﬁciency , ease - of - use , and versatility obtained here with the (cid:1) C31 - based integration system represents an important advance in transgenesis and opens up the possibility of systematic , high - throughput screening of large cDNA sets and regulatory elements . attP landing sites (cid:1) germ - line transformation (cid:1) site - speciﬁc integration A major goal in the present era of genomics is to identify and functionally characterize all genes relevant to a specific path - way or biological process . With its powerful repertoire of genetic tools , themulticellularmodelorganism Drosophilamelanogaster has played an eminent role in this endeavor ( 1 ) . One method to identify relevant genes is to perform chemical mutagenesis screens of various kinds . Another very fruitful approach in Drosophila has been the use of P - element - mediated germ - line transformation ( 2 , 3 ) , especially when combined with tools such as the Gal4 / UAS expression system ( 4 ) or when it is used for insertional mutagenesis ( 5 , 6 ) . One characteristic of P - elements is their random integration behavior . Although this ‘‘randomness’’ is advantageous for gener - ating mutations and deletions , it is generally not ideal for transgene analysis . The random integration of P - elements necessitates con - siderable effort to map insertions . Genomic position effects com - plicate the analysis of transgenes and render precise structure / function analyses nearly impossible . A further shortcoming of the P - element system is its relatively moderate transformation effi - ciency , a significant hurdle to any large - scale transgenesis effort . Strategies have been developed to circumvent the problem of randomness by targeted integration systems in Drosophila , which are generally based on the FLP and Cre recombinases ( 7 – 9 , 32 ) . Such techniques permit precise targeting to genomic landing sites but are still handicapped by transformation rates that are , at best , moderately higher than those achieved with the P - element system ( 8 ) . Furthermore , especially for FLP / FRT , these recombinase sys - tems are often reserved for applications other than targeted inte - gration , such as mosaic analysis ( 10 ) , and are thus not suited to be used concomitantly for transgene integration . Recently , another genome integration method has been devel - oped , based on the site - specific (cid:1) C31 integrase ( 11 ) , and has subsequently been applied to Drosophila ( 12 ) . The bacteriophage (cid:1) C31 encodes a serine integrase that mediates sequence - directed recombination between a bacterial attachment site ( attB ) and a phage attachment site ( attP ) ( 13 ) . Apart from the site - specificity , another feature of the (cid:1) C31 system is that the integrase solely mediates integration ( 13 ) , which distinguishes it from most other commonly used systems , such as Cre / loxP or FLP / FRT , where the recombinase can catalyze both the integration and the excision reactions . Here we set out to bring the (cid:1) C31 system to a level of efficiency , convenience , and expandability that renders it suitable for large - scale transgenesis approaches . In particular , we sought to make the system more robust by improving the delivery of the (cid:1) C31 integrase and to create a library of well characterized , highly efficient landing sites throughout the four major chromosomes of the Drosophila genome . These landing sites were designed so as to not interfere with commonly used markers and transposon systems , and to be manipulatable in vivo by the Cre / loxP and attP / attB systems . Dif - ferent ‘‘endogenous’’ (cid:1) C31 integrase sources were generated and optimized to overcome the need of coinjecting capped , in vitro synthesized integrase mRNA . The combination of these tools allows for convenient and efficient site - specific germ - line transfor - mation . Finally , we present the development of an integration system that utilizes an immediate visible readout for specific attP targeting and therefore should permit rapid selection for precise integration events . Results Design of a Versatile attPLanding Site . A landing site ( referred to as M { 3xP3 - RFPattP } ; Fig . 1 a ) was constructed with the following features . ( i ) It contains an attP site , which serves as the docking site for any incoming attB - containing plasmid . ( ii ) As a marker , we chose the red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) driven by the artificial 3xP3 promoter , leading to strong RFP expression in the eyes ( 14 ) . RFP was chosen so as to not preclude the later use of the widespread markers yellow (cid:1) and white (cid:1) . ( iii ) The 3xP3 - RFP cassette is flanked by loxP sites , allowing for the elimination of this marker via Cre recombinase - mediated excision . ( iv ) The 3xP3 - RFPattP construct is flanked by inverted repeats of the Mos1 mariner element to allow mariner - mediated transgenesis , making the landing site refractory to the P - element and piggyBac transposases , thus permitting unre - stricted use of multipurpose transposon systems in conjunction with this landing site .

Upon mariner - mediated germ - line transformation , 68 independent lines , designated as ‘‘ ZH - attP ’’ lines , were established ( by screening the F 1 generation for eye - specific RFP expression ) . Genomic DNA samples of these lines were subjected to an inverse PCR assay to determine the exact genomic location of their transgene . BLAST - based comparisons of the inverse PCR sequences with the D . melanogaster genome sequence ( Ensembl v41 database ) revealed an unambiguous loca - tion in 64 cases , while four lines yielded several matches , indicating that their transgene integrated into repetitive elements . Of the 64 precisely mapped lines , 25 lines were chosen for being pursued further because they fulfilled two criteria : these 25 landing sites are homozygous viable and are intergenically located [ Fig . 1 b and supporting information ( SI ) Table 4 ] . The accumulating genomics and proteomics data , however , may alter the assessment of the intergenic positioning and may therefore modify the number of these candidate lines . Germ - Line - Specific Integrase Sources . A few of the ZH - attP lines were then selected for germ - line transformation with a specifically generated pUASTattB plasmid ( Fig . 1 c ) carrying a lacZ reporter and a white (cid:1) marker gene . This plasmid was coinjected with capped mRNA encoding the (cid:1) C31 integrase . Adults obtained after injec - tion were individually crossed with y w animals and their offspring were screened for white (cid:1) expression . We define the frequency of transgenesis ( F trans ) asthefractionoffertilecrossesthatgaveatleast one white (cid:1) offspring . The ZH - attP - 86Fb showed the highest F trans ( 25 % ) , which exceeded those of the previously described landing site attP2 ( 12 ) , for which we have never reached values above 7 % ( data not shown ) . It also became clear , however , that the variable quality and stability of the capped , coinjected integrase mRNA poses a problem for reliably determining and comparing the F trans values of our attP lines and possibly also limit the efficiency of attB transgene integration . Tocircumventthisproblemandtofacilitatetheinjectionprocess , we sought to generate an ‘‘endogenous’’ source of the (cid:1) C31 integrase . To do this , we created a P - element that can express a (cid:1) C31 integrase under the control of the nanos regulatory elements . This construct also attaches a nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) to the C terminus of the integrase , because previous reports in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells suggest that the adding of a C - terminal NLS substantially enhances integration frequency ( 15 ) . We obtained four independent P - element insertions and selected an insert on the X chromosome for further studies . Using this line , we were able to obtain substantially better integration frequencies than with the coinjected (cid:1) C31 integrase mRNA used previously [ integration rates were up to 30 % for the landing site attP2 of Groth et al . ( 12 ) ] . To optimize the integrase source further , we decided to modify various elements in the basic construct and determine how they affect integration frequencies . Two elements that were of particular interest to us were the promoters and the NLS . Therefore , constructs were assembled that express the (cid:1) C31 integrase ( (cid:1) / (cid:2) NLS ) under the control of the regulatory elements of either the vasa or the nanos gene , including the promoter , 5 (cid:3) UTR , and 3 (cid:3) UTR sequences of these genes ( Fig . 2 a ) . Regulatory elements of these genes are known to cause germ cell - specific expression , either by specifically directing zygotic transcription in these cells ( vasa ) ( 16 ) or by spatially regulating translation and stability of maternal mRNA , which leads to expression at the posterior of the embryo where germ cells form ( nanos ) ( 17 – 23 ) . Tocomparethesefourconstructs inaquantitativemanner , itwas imperative that they all be expressed from the same chromosomal context . We therefore made use of the attP / attB system . An attB site was introduced into the integrase constructs , allowing us to bring each of them to an identical position in the genome by using the same attP landing site for germ - line transformation . The constructs were tested in two locations : first at cytological position 86F of the third chromosome by employing line ZH - attP - 86Fb ( set - up I ) , and then at cytological position 102D of the fourth chromosome via ZH - attP - 102D ( set - up II ) ( Fig . 1 b ) . For set - up I , the four integrants on the third chromosome were made homozygous for a free attP landing site on the fourth chromosome ( from ZH - attP - 102D ) , whereas for set - up II , the four integrase insertions on the fourth chromosome were made homozygous for a free attP site on the third chromosome ( from ZH - attP - 86Fb ) ( Fig . 2 b ) . Antibody stain - ings were performed to confirm the specific expression of integrase in the posterior pole cells of lines transgenic for (cid:1) C31 integrase ( Fig . 2 d and data not shown ) . All resulting eight lines were then injected with pUAS - lacZattB and the frequencies of integration were scored ( Table 1 ) . The F trans values ranged from 32 % to 43 % in set - up I and from 16 % to 55 % in set - up II . A number of observations were made in these experiments . ( i ) The vasa - driven integrase transgenes were generally more efficient in mediating germ line transformation than the nanos constructs . ( ii ) Although the addition of the NLS did somewhat increase the efficiency of nanos - (cid:1) C31 , it had an adverse effect on the activity of the vasa - (cid:1) C31 integrase . ( iii ) Set - up II led to higher integration X 2 3 4 2A 22A 88A 94D 86D 75C 64A 102D 96E 92A 86F 83D 68E 62B 51D 36B 30A 58A 51C 35B 20C 3B 6E m ( 3 ' ) m ( 5 ' ) a b c loxP loxP 3x - P3 RFP tub α 1 attP white loxP UAS - MCS - SV40 white loxP UAS - MCS - SV40 attB attP loxP loxP loxP loxP attL attR Φ C31 pUASTattB 3xP3 - RFP 3xP3 - RFP Fig . 1 .

The (cid:1) C31integrasemediatesrecombinationbetween attB and attP sites , resultingintheintegrationof pUASTattB into the landing site , thereby creating the two hybrid sites attL and attR , which are refractory to the (cid:1) C31 integrase . The ﬁnal conﬁguration at the landing site is directed by the orientation of the attB and attP elements . The loxP sites allow elimination of intervening sequences before or after integration of pUASTattB ( indicatedwithﬂatarrowheads ) .

( iv ) The concentration of the injected plasmid did not critically affect the transgenic frequency ( 215 versus 800 ng / (cid:3) l ; Table 1 ) . In summary , the above - described observations favor the vasa - (cid:1) C31 construct for achieving highest transgenic frequencies . Tocreateanintegrasesourcethatcouldbequicklyremovedfrom a transgenic line , we inserted the vasa - (cid:1) C31 construct into each of our four candidate attP sites on the X chromosome ( Fig . 1 b ) . The resulting lines were then tested by comparing their efficiency in catalyzinganinsertionreactionatthe attP siteof ZH - attP - 86Fb . The F trans values varied between 29 % and 50 % ( Table 2 ; these values werederivedfrominjectionsintoembryosheterozygousforthe attP landing site and hemizygous for the vasa - (cid:1) C31 construct and therefore probably underestimate those expected from stocks ho - mozygous for the attP site ) . These results indicate that vas - (cid:1) C31 - zh2A performs best . We recently also generated a (cid:1) C31 integrase construct in which the coding region was adapted to the D . melanogaster codon usage . This codon - optimized transgene , d (cid:1) C31 , differs in 172 nucleotides from the phage (cid:1) C31 integrase ORF and further increased trans - formation rates ( 69 % for G 0 male outcrosses in a situation equiv - alent to set - up II ; see above ) . This construct will be introduced into ZH - attP - 2A to generate an X - linked vas - d (cid:1) C31 line .

To investigate whether such (cid:1) C31 inte - grase - mediated effects occur in Drosophila , we examined two lines , nos - (cid:1) NLS - zh86Fb / attP - zh102D and attP - zh86Fb / vas - (cid:1) - zh102D ; they werechosenbecausetheyrepresentthemostefficientcombinationsofanautosomal nanos or vasa - driven integrase and a free attP site with respect to integration frequency ( see Table 1 ) . The concom - itant presence of a free attP site in these lines not only resembles what one might use in practice , but might also increase the potential incidence of a chromosomal rearrangement . From each of the two lines , 10randomlyselectedmaleswerecrossedwith yw females , and the resulting larvae were subjected to a chromosomal analysis . For eachcross , thesalivaryglandsofsixtoeightF 1 larvaeweredissected and their polytene chromosomes were analyzed . In none of the 136 examined preparations did we observe any abnormal chromosomal configurations ( SI Fig . 4 c and d ) . As a control we used a chromosomal deletion ( of (cid:4) 500 kb ) and various inversions that were readily detected in each case ( SI Fig . 4 a and b ) . The two tested lines had been propagated for more than 7 months before this analysis . Together , these results indicate that , at least for the euchromatic portion of the genome , the mutagenic effects of the (cid:1) C31 integrase are not a serious concern in Drosophila . Accessibility , Transgene Expression , and Position Effects of Various attP Lines . We next characterized 16 of the 25 candidate attP lines with respect to their integration frequencies and expression behav - ior . Unlike the set - ups shown in Table 1 , where stocks were generated that are doubly homozygous for an attP site and an integrase construct , we directly crossed males homozygous or hemizygous for the attP site with females homozygous for the vasa - (cid:1) C31 integrase located at 102D on the fourth chromosome . The resulting doubly heterozygous embryos were injected with pUAS - lacZattB . The transgenic frequencies ranged from 28 % ( ZH - attP - 86Fa ) to 60 % ( ZH - attP - 51D ) ( Table 3 ) . These numbers likely underestimate the F trans values expected for doubly homozy - gous set - ups . This can be concluded from line ZH - attP - 86Fb , where the F trans values were determined for both heterozygotes ( 43 % for G 0 male outcrosses ; see Table 3 ) and homozygotes ( 61 % for G 0 male outcrosses ) . The transgenic lacZ flies from these injection experiments were then crossed to apterous ( ap ) - and omb - Gal4 driver lines . To detect (cid:4) - galactosidase activity , third instar imaginal discs were subjected to X - Gal staining ( SI Fig . 5 ) . The observed wing disk patterns recapitulate the expression patterns expected from the drivers used . In none of the cases did we observe repression or ectopic expression of lacZ , indicating that they are not strongly influenced by nearby enhancers or repressors . Unspecific Integrations Are Rare Events . To estimate the extent of integrations occurring specifically at the provided attP site versus integrations occurring elsewhere in the genome , we relied on two assays . First , one of the 16 attP lines injected with pUAS - lacZattB carries the landing site on the X chromosome , namely ZH - attP - 2A ( Table 3 ) . Because in these injections we always provided the attP chromosome through the males , the injected male G 0 animals should not have a free attP site and therefore should not give rise to transgenic offspring , unless the integration occurred nonspecifically . None of the G 0 males from the ZH - attP - 2A yielded transgenic offspring ( n (cid:5) 77 fertile crosses ) , whereas G 0 females did ( Table 3 and data not shown ) , emphasizing a high degree of specificity . Second , we injected the pUAS - lacZattB plasmid at high concentration ( 800 ng / (cid:3) l ) into embryos that were homozygous for vas - (cid:1) C31 on the fourth chromosome ( 102F ) but were otherwise not equipped with a free attP landing site . Of the 53 fertile G 0 outcrosses , only one gave transgenic progeny ( two animals ) , which is an (cid:4) 27 times lower frequency than seen in the presence of an attP site at position 86F ( Table 1 ) . Subsequent inverse PCR on this transgenic line revealed an integration event at 2L 37F , into a site that shows no obvious homology to the 39 - bp core attP sequence ( 25 ) . The integration was accompanied by a microdeletion of 11 base pairs at the target site and both a 2 - bp deletion and a single nucleotide exchange in the attB part of the hybrid attL site close to the crossover site . Taking these results together , it appears that unspecific integrations are rare events . A ‘‘Split - white’’ Reconstitution System as an Immediate Readout for Specific attP Targeting . Although our analyses revealed a high degree of specificity with respect to attP targeting , an immediate readout confirming a specific integration event would nevertheless Table 2 .

In particular for structure / function analyses , which involve the comparison of subtly differing transgenes , an identical integration site is essential . When analyzing a large number of transgenes it would be convenient to eliminate PCR confirmation ofeachone . Toestablishsuchasystem , alargepartofthe white gene ( exons 3 – 6 ) was placed into the landing site . The remaining part ( promoter and exons 1 – 2 ) is provided by the transformation vector pw P - Ex2 UASTattB . Only if the incoming attB plasmid integrates into the donor attP site , located in the white intron between exons 2 and 3 , will a functional white gene be reconstituted and result in the functional expression of white , indicating precise attP targeting . Instead of generating a new collection of specific split - white attP landing sites , we devised a strategy to permit the transformation of our existing attP sites into split - white attP sites . Line ZH - attP - 86Fb was used to establish a proof - of - principle for this approach . First , the 3xP3 - RFP cassette was eliminated by Cre - mediated excision , leaving one loxP site and the attP docking site at the genomic locus ( Fig . 3 a ) . We then introduced the split - white landing site construct into the attP site by (cid:1) C31 integrase - mediated integration , re - marking the site with the 3xP3 - RFP and providing a new attP site for subsequent (cid:1) C31 - mediated integration ( Fig . 3 b ) . Because the split - white landing site construct contains both an attP site and an attB site , intermolecular recombination between plasmids can occur , leading to the integration of more than one construct . Thus , transgenic lines resulting from this procedure were tested by PCR and sequencing ( data not shown ) , and lines containing only a single split - white landing site construct were established . In addition to serving as an indicator for specificity , this split - white system reduces the size of the marker transgene and hence of the transformation vector , a property that should facilitate its handling and further increase the frequency of transgenesis . Discussion The use of transgenes is essential for understanding the function of genes , their products , and their regulatory elements . The (cid:1) C31 system described here should strongly facilitate such studies and should allow for the embarking of projects that until now have not been feasible with the available techniques . Below , we discuss how our strategy has advanced the recently described use of (cid:1) C31 integrase in Drosophila ( 12 ) . We describe here the generation of a large collection of precisely mapped attP landingsites . Theseoffergreatflexibilityregardingthe choice of integration sites and the expression levels of transgenes . Predetermined integration sites effectively eliminate the time and effort needed to map transgene insertions , in contrast to those obtained by traditional transposon - mediated germ - line transfor - mation . Defined attP sites allow precise in vivo structure / function analyses , as we have shown here in testing modified integrase constructs . Other advantages of using defined and precharacterized attP sites are that fewer lines for any given transgene will need to be generated , analyzed , and maintained . The need for long - term storage can be avoided altogether because the transgenic lines can be exactly reproduced as long as the original attP line ( s ) and constructs are available . The vast size of our landing site collection will also facilitate the simultaneous use of multiple transgenes , an increasing need in sophisticated fly genetics . The design of our landing site , intentionally lacking commonly used markers and withstanding commonly used transposases , offers further flexibility in this respect . A significant improvement of our approach is the establishment of germ - line - specific (cid:1) C31 integrases . The presence of an ‘‘endog - enous’’ source of a transformation - mediating enzyme distinguishes this system from most other commonly used germ - line transfor - mation methods for Drosophila . The use of a transgenic source of (cid:1) C31 integrase eliminates the time and costs required for mRNA production and significantly reduces the complications associated withtheinjectionprocess , suchasthevariabilityinefficiencycaused by the quality and stability of the capped (cid:1) C31 integrase mRNA . Importantly , our transgenic integrase sources also considerably enhance the integration rates . Another attractive feature of our system is its amenability to additional modifications .

Other modifications may include the pre - placing of promoters and / or reporters into the landing site . A further example for expandability of this system is the ability to make iterative in vivo assemblies ( 26 ) , which will permit the analysis of large DNA units at a given locus . The elimination of vector sequences from inte - grating constructs , an advantage usually claimed by recombinase - mediatedcassetteexchange ( RMCE ) approaches ( 8 , 9 , 27 ) , canalso be achieved with our system by Cre - mediated excision , leaving essentially only one loxP site and the transgene with its regulatory elements at the genomic locus ( see Figs . 1 c and 3 c ) . Finally , a promising future application of this system is the handling of large DNA sets , as for instance cDNA libraries or collections of RNAi constructs . With the transformation system reported here , collections of constructs can be site - specifically and efficiently integrated into the genome , thus eliminating the efforts of mapping and testing . ‘‘ UAS - ORF in vivo ’’ libraries , for example , could be used for systematic mis - or overexpression screens that so far have been conducted mainly with EP - lines ( 28 ) , an approach that suffered from not achieving saturation and from requiring complex analyses for the unambiguous identification of the phe - notype - causing gene . In summary , the system and resources presented in this study will simplify and accelerate the process of germ - line transformation in Drosophila and facilitate large - scale projects that so far have not been feasible with available techniques . Materials and Methods Plasmid Construction . Details on plasmid construction are available in SI Text . GenBank accession numbers are as follows : M { 3xP3 - RFPattP } , EF362407 ; M { 3xP3 - RFPattP (cid:3) } , EF362408 ; pUASTattB , EF362409 . Germ - Line Transformation and Cre - Mediated Excision . The mariner - mediated integration of the landing site construct pM { 3xP3 - RFPattP } into flies with y (cid:2) w (cid:2) background was performed accord - ing to standard germ - line transformation procedures by using the helper plasmid pKhsp82MOS ( 29 ) . The generated attP lines were balanced by using standard fly stocks and procedures . All used integrase constructs ( with the exception of the nos - (cid:1) C31 NLS con - struct on the X ) and the split - white landing site construct p3xP3 - RFP / w Ex3 - 6 attP / B were coinjected with (cid:1) C31 integrase capped mRNA into the mentioned attP sites to generate stable lines . The (cid:1) C31 integrase mRNAs were either transcribed from the plasmid pET11phiC31poly ( A ) ( 12 ) or from the plasmid pcDNA3 . 1 - (cid:1) C31 , according to the protocol of the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit ( Ambion ) . Coinjections with mRNA were mainly done as described in ref . 12 . DNAs were diluted in either TE buffer or water , mRNAs were diluted in nuclease - free water ( Ambion ) . The 3xP3 - RFP cassette was eliminated from line ZH - attP - 86Fb via crossing to a hsp70 - Cre line ; excision was confirmed by standard PCR and sequencing . Inverse PCR and Sequence Analysis . Inverse PCR was performed as described on the web site of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project ( www . fruitfly . org ) . The restriction enzymes used were MspI , Sau3AI , and XhoI ( the latter for the unspecific integration event at 2L 37F ) . Primers used were designed according to the attP landing site construct . For the 25 ‘‘candidate’’ lines in SI Table 4 , the 3 (cid:3) flanking sequences were again PCR - amplified with more distant primers , followed by sequencing of the two independent PCR products . Inverse PCR sequences were blasted against the sequence data provided on the Ensembl fruit fly site ( www . ensembl . org ) . Searches were done with Ensembl release 41 , and the search tool SSAHA2 was used . X - Gal Staining . To detect (cid:4) - galactosidase activity , third - instar larval discs were fixed and subjected to a standard X - Gal color reaction for 20 min at room temperature . Antibody Staining . The antibody staining was done as described in ref . 30 . The primary antibody was diluted at 1 / 500 . As a secondary antibody , we used a goat anti - rabbit conjugated to DTAF from Jackson ImmunoResearch at a dilution of 1 : 400 . Chromosome Squashes . Preparation of salvary gland polytene chro - mosomes was performed as described in ref . 31 . Chromosomes were analyzed by phase - contrast microscopy at a magnification of (cid:6) 100 . We thank P .
