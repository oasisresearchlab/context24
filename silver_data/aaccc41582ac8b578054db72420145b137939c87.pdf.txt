A key process in neuronal actin dynamics is ﬁlament formation by actin nucleators , such as the Arp2 / 3 complex , formins and the brain - enriched , novel WH2 domain - based nucleators Spire and cordon - bleu ( Cobl ) . We here discuss in detail the currently available data on the roles of these actin nucleators during neuromorphogenesis and highlight how their required control at the plasma membrane may be brought about . The Arp2 / 3 complex was found to be espe - cially important for proper growth cone translocation and axon development . The underlying molecular mechanisms for Arp2 / 3 complex activation at the neuronal plasma membrane include a recruitment and an activation of N - WASP by lipid - and F - actin - binding adaptor proteins , Cdc42 and phosphatidyl - inositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) . Together , these components upstream of N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex ensure ﬁne - control of N - WASP - mediated Arp2 / 3 complex activation and control distinct func - tions during axon development . They are counteracted by Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitors , such as PICK , which likewise play an important role in neuromorphogenesis . In contrast to the crucial role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in proper axon development , dendrite formation and dendritic arborization was revealed to critically involve the newly identiﬁed actin nucleator Cobl . Cobl is a brain - enriched protein and uses three Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 ( WH2 ) domains for actin binding and for promot - ing the formation of non - bundled , unbranched ﬁlaments . Thus , cells use different actin nucleators to steer the complex remodeling processes underlying cell morphogenesis , the formation of cellular networks and the development of complex body plans . © 2010 Elsevier GmbH .

Introduction Assembly , organization and turn - over of ﬁlamentous actin structures are crucial for life , as these processes for example pro - mote cellular division and locomotion and ensure cellular and tissue integrity . Contractile and protrusive forces are brought about by the actin cytoskeleton associated with the plasma membrane . The cortical actin cytoskeleton plays important roles in shaping the morphology of cells and of deﬁned membrane areas . The rate - limiting step in actin ﬁlament formation in vitro is the assembly of a trimeric actin nucleus onto which fur - ther actin monomers can then add spontaneously . Cells use nucleation - promoting factors to overcome the kinetic barrier of actin nucleation and elongation - promoting factors , such as Ena / VASP proteins , to prevent premature capping of the fast - ∗ Corresponding authors .

The Arp2 / 3 complex is a stable assembly of two actin - related proteins ( Arp2 and 3 ) and ﬁve further proteins . This nucleator acts by serving as a template for monomer addition by mimicking the barbed end of a growing ﬁlament . The required activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex is achieved by a member of the Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASP ) family consisting of WASP , N - WASP , the Scar / WAVE proteins , WASH and WHAMM . Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin nucleation gives rise to branched actin ﬁlaments , as the complex binds to the sides of actin mother ﬁlaments and remains associated with the pointed end leaving the barbed end free to elongate ( Pollard , 2007 ; Campellone and Welch , 2010 ) . Formins are a relatively diverse group of actin nucleators evo - lutionarily conserved in eukaryotes throughout a wide range of species including yeast , plants , fruit ﬂies and mammals . Formins are implicated in the assembly of the linear actin ﬁlaments found in cytokinetic contractile rings , adherens junctions and ﬁlopodia .

Kessels et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 90 ( 2011 ) 926 – 933 927 Fig . 1 . Stages of development of hippocampal neurons in culture . Five functionally distinct stages can be distinguished , during stage 1 cells attach and form lamellipodia , stage 2 is marked by the formation and dynamics of minor protrusions ( neurites ) , in stage 3 one of the neurites becomes the axon , which subsequently elongates rapidly , in stage 4 dendrites grow out and branch and stage 5 , the further maturation of the neurons , includes synaptogenesis and network formation with other cells . The approximate time points , at which the cells enter the respective stage , are indicated . ture with their formin homology ( FH ) 2 domains , which surround the fast growing barbed end of actin ﬁlaments , remain processively associated with the barbed end during ﬁlament elongation and thereby prevent the association of capping proteins . The functional differences between the diverse members of the formin family and how these proteins are regulated is the focus of intense current research ( for reviews see e . g . Higgs , 2005 ; Kovar , 2006 ; Goode and Eck , 2007 ; Faix and Grosse , 2006 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) . Recently , a new class of actin nucleators has been discovered , the WH2 domain - containing actin nucleators . This group of proteins uses multiple WASP - homology 2 ( WH2 ) domains , small motifs for actin monomer binding , or WH2 domains in combination with F - actin binding motifs to assemble actin seeds large enough for subsequent spontaneous elongation ( for review , see Qualmann and Kessels , 2009 ) . In mammals , this group of proteins consists of Spire ( Quinlan et al . , 2005 ) , cordon - bleu ( Cobl ) ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) , leiomodin2 ( Lmod - 2 ) ( Chereau et al . , 2008 ) and JMY ( Zuchero et al . , 2009 ) . Whereas the nuclear p53 cofactor JMY apparently is expressed in the brain ( Shikama et al . , 1999 ) but is not implicated in neuromorphogenesis , Lmod - 2 is exclusively restricted to skeletal muscle and heart muscle cells ( Conley et al . , 2001 ) . The morphogenesis of neuronal cells during brain development The function of the vertebrate brain relies on the complex archi - tecture of neuronal networks and on organized cellular arrays and layers , such as the well - known layers of the cerebral cortex . This observed complexity arises from complex migration patterns of dif - ferent types and cohorts of neurons born from stem cells in the ventricular zone during embryonic development of the brain and the astonishing morphological intricacy that neurons acquire dur - ing their differentiation once they have reached their destination . The cytoskeletal mechanisms of conversion of post - mitotic neuronal cells with a multipolar morphology into elongated and polarized migrating cells and the cytoskeletal components required for cell migration have been reviewed elsewhere ( e . g . Kawauchi and Hoshino , 2008 ) . Here we will focus on vertebrate factors that promote actin ﬁlament nucleation involved in the induction and elaboration of the dendritic and axonal compartments of neuronal cells – processes crucial for the formation of neuronal networks during development but also for plasticity and repair processes in the brain . Mainly observations of low - density cultures of dissociated embryonal neurons of the hippocampus have allowed the deﬁnition of ﬁve distinct stages of polarity and morphology estab - lishment ( Fig . 1 ; Dotti et al . , 1988 ) . In stage 1 , cells are still relatively round and show an unpolar distribution of lamellipodia . Shortly thereafter , cylindrical processes that contain a growth cone at their distal end tip start to sprout . For some hours , these processes ( called immature neurites ) lack the molecular and structural character - istics of mature axonal and dendritic processes and extend and retract without net elongation ( stage 2 ) . The transition to stage 3 is marked by the selection of one of the neurites to form the axon . This neurite is distinguished by a larger growth cone and rapidly elongates without retraction . After axon formation in stage 3 , an elaborate , branched dendritic arbor is formed at a slower rate ( stage 4 ) . Dendrite formation is a very dynamic process and is controlled by a combination of internal and external cues leading to a contin - uous addition and retraction of dendritic branches . Finally at stage 5 starting about one week after neurite induction , neurons form synaptic contacts and thereby create neuronal networks ( Fig . 1 ) . Since in cell lines , such as mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells or cells derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla ( PC12 ) , not all of these stages are run through properly , this review will focus on gain - of - function and loss - of - function studies of axono - and dendritogenesis conducted in primary neurons . Mechanistically , the initiation of neuritic arbor formation of neuronal cells requires breaking a sphere ( neurite initiation ) or a cylindrical surface ( branch establishment ) . Interestingly , the lamel - lipodia formed during stage 1 alone seem not to be sufﬁcient for neuritogenesis but disruption of the lamellipodial edge by pro - truding ﬁlopodia or actin microspikes is of utmost importance . The formation of such protrusions is critically dependent on actin poly - merization , as capping barbed ends with cytochalasin inhibits the formation of both protrusions and neurites ( Williams et al . , 1988 ; Edson et al . , 1993 ) . Also Ena / VASP proteins , known for their role in the formation of actin ﬁlament bundles and ﬁlopodia in large axonal growth cones ( Drees and Gertler , 2008 ) , play a critical role in promoting actin ﬁlament elongation during neuromorphogenesis ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 2007 ; Dent et al . , 2007 ) . The question which actin nucleation factor is initiating the ﬁl - aments used to extend protrusive cell structures in the ﬁrst place represents the focus of this review . Despite some remaining incon - sistencies and open questions , the intense research on this topic in recent years revealed a more and more clearly visible picture of actin nucleation promoting factors involved in the different neuro - morphogenesis processes . 928 M . M . Kessels et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 90 ( 2011 ) 926 – 933 Fig . 2 . Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin nucleation . ( A ) The Arp2 / 3 complex , a complex of actin - related protein 2 and 3 and ﬁve further components , is activated by a member of the WASP protein family , currently consisting of WASP , N - WASP ( here depicted as an example ) , Scar / WAVE proteins , WASH and WHAMM . N - WASP binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex , activates the complex and recruits proﬁlin - bound G - actin . N - WASP is controlled by autoinhibition , which is released by several N - WASP - interacting components , such as the GTPase Cdc42 , phosphatidyl - inositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) and SH3 domain - containing proteins interacting with the central proline - rich domain of N - WASP . The dimeric form of the F - BAR domain protein syndapin is depicted here as an example . ( B ) In vitro reconstitutions show that Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin nucleation gives rise to branched F - actin structures . ( C ) These branched structures contain the Arp2 / 3 complex at the branchpoint ( minus end of the newly forming ﬁlament ) . The plus end remains free for spontaneous elongation of the ﬁlament . Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin ﬁlament formation The Arp2 / 3 complex is a powerful machine for actin ﬁla - ment formation . Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated ﬁlament formation was observed to generate considerable protrusive and propelling forces both in vitro and also in vivo . In cells , Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin ﬁlament formation is carefully restricted and tightly con - trolled at several layers . First , the basal activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex itself is low unless nucleation - promoting factors – most prominently members of the WASP family – are binding to the complex ( Fig . 2 ) . These Arp2 / 3 complex activating proteins are themselves tightly controlled by several cellular cues , too . Compo - nents controlling WASP family proteins in time and space include Rho - type GTPases , lipids and a variety of speciﬁc adaptor proteins ( Fig . 2 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ; Campellone and Welch , 2010 ) . Furthermore , proteins negatively inﬂuencing Arp2 / 3 complex activity both in reconstitutions of actin polymerization in vitro as well as in neurons have been identiﬁed ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . In line with an activation of actin nucleation in vivo , primary hippocampal neurons overexpressing N - WASP showed a promi - nent increase in the number of neurites extending from each neuron when compared to control cells . Additionally , the neurite network extending from N - WASP - overexpressing cells appeared highly branched ( Pinyol et al . , 2007 ) . Consistent with the ﬁnding that neurite induction is dependent on Cdc42 ( Govek et al . , 2005 ) , N - WASP - induced neurite formation was suppressed by coexpres - sion of a dominant - negative mutant of Cdc42 ( Pinyol et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , N - WASP seems not only to integrate Cdc42 signalling but also a variety of other cues . N - WASP - mediated neurite forma - tion also depended on the F - actin binding protein Abp1 ( Kessels et al . , 2000 ) , which binds to and activates N - WASP in cooperativ - ity with Cdc42 ( Pinyol et al . , 2007 ) . Similar to these observations of Arp2 / 3 complex gain - of - function phenotypes , RNAi - mediated knock - down of the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor PICK1 led to increased neuronal arborization close to the cell body , a phenotype that was rescued by wild - type PICK1 but not by a mutant deﬁcient for Arp2 / 3 complex binding ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . In neurons at relatively early stages of development , expression of N - WASP mutants defective for Arp2 / 3 complex activation resulted in reduced neurite exten - sion ( Banzai et al . , 2000 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2002 ) . The gain - of - function phenotype of N - WASP resulting in exces - sive formation of neurites and neuritic branches is not mirrored by the C - terminus of WASP family proteins , the VCA fragment , which is a strong activator of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin ﬁlament formation in vitro ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Zalevsky et al . , 2001 ) . Instead , neuronal phenotypes similar to Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition and Arp3 and N - WASP loss - of - function , i . e . defects in proper axon development ( see below ) , were observed ( Strasser et al . , 2004 ) . This apparent discrepancy is likely due to the fact that VCA , although it strongly stimulates the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro , also activates the Arp2 / 3 complex in cells however aberrantly in the cytosol but not at the plasma membrane ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . Taken together , these observations suggested that a recruitment of N - WASP to the cell cortex is of importance for N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent processes during neuromorphogenesis . Recent studies identiﬁed brain - enriched N - WASP - binding pro - teins that mediate the plasma membrane recruitment crucial for establishment and plastic changes of neuronal morphology . Among these membrane and N - WASP - binding proteins are syndapins , which belong to the F - BAR family within the so - called BAR domain superfamily ( for reviews , see Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ; Fütterer and Machesky , 2007 ; Aspenström , 2009 ) . BAR domain proteins represent a large and diverse group of proteins that are character - ized by their ability to form dimeric , curved membrane interaction domains of different curvature and lipid speciﬁcity ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . We have identiﬁed the proteins of the syndapin family ( also called PACSINs ) to link membrane remodelling and membrane traf - ﬁcking processes with the actin cytoskeleton , as they on one side interact with membrane lipids and components of vesicle forma - tion machineries and on the other side interface with the Arp2 / 3 complex - activator N - WASP ( Qualmann et al . , 1999 ; Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2002 , 2006 ; Braun et al . , 2005 ; Kessels et al . , 2006 ; Salvarezza et al . , 2009 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . The brain - enriched isoform is syndapin I ( Qualmann et al . , M . M . Kessels et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 90 ( 2011 ) 926 – 933 929 Fig . 3 . Knock - down and inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex as well as deﬁciency for the upstream Arp2 / 3 complex - activating components N - WASP and syndapin I result in increased axon length and branching .

This publication also includes quantitative analyses of the phenotypes , e . g . the summarized length of the axonal arbor was 140 – 150 % of control for Arp3 RNAi , Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition by CA overexpression , and syndapin I RNAi and 190 % of control for N - WASP RNAi . Nonsilencing RNAi was indistinguishable from control ( pRNAT ) . All effects were highly signiﬁcant with p < 0 . 001 ( * * * ) . 1999 ) and further studies suggest that this protein may be involved in the neuropathology of Huntington’s disease ( Modregger et al . , 2002 ) and is important for synaptic transmission processes ( Kim et al . , 2006 ; Anggono et al . , 2006 ; Andersson et al . , 2008 ) . Mechanis - tically , syndapin oligomers seem to act as multivalent organizing platforms , which can spatially and temporally coordinate mem - brane remodelling with local actin polymerization ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2006 ) . In line with syndapins acting as N - WASP activators , the syn - dapin I gain - of - function phenotype in neuromorphogenesis exactly mirrored the effects of N - WASP overexpression and was clearly dependent on N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymer - ization ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . This effect was furthermore dependent on the syndapin Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain , which binds to N - WASP ( Qualmann et al . , 1999 ) and is sufﬁcient to release N - WASP autoinhibition thereby activating N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin ﬁlament formation in conjunction with Cdc42 and PIP 2 ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) , and on the syn - dapin F - BAR domain , which mediates the association of syndapin with membranes containing phosphatidylserine ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . Since plasma - membrane targeting of the syndapin SH3 domain was sufﬁcient for eliciting protru - sive structures ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2006 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) and syndapins have been demonstrated to be able to recruit N - WASP in vivo ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2002 ) , it seems that ( non - homogenous ) triggering of actin nucleation at the cell cor - tex is sufﬁcient to generate neurite - like protrusions and dendritic branching . Although the Arp2 / 3 complex as well as its activation machin - ery localize throughout neuronal cells , loss - of - function phenotypes show intriguing speciﬁcity for the axonal compartment . Inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex as well as knock - down of both Arp3 and N - WASP resulted in increased axonal length and axonal branch - ing in early stages of neuronal development ( Fig . 3 ; Strasser et al . , 2004 ; Kakimoto et al . , 2006 ; Pinyol et al . , 2007 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . An analysis of total neurite length upon deple - tion of the Arp2 / 3 complex , in contrast , did not reveal any differences ( Korobova and Svitkina , 2008 ) . Considering that the Arp2 / 3 complex is established to promote cell migration , the observed increases in axon length and branching seem counterin - tuitive . The molecular mechanism for the apparently paradoxical increase in axonal length and thus positive effect on growth cone translocation upon Arp2 / 3 complex - loss - of - function has not yet been revealed . It is possible that disruption of Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent higher order actin networks in the growth cone may promote the rapid extension of Arp2 / 3 complex - independently formed , mostly unbranched and parallel actin ﬁbers in the periph - ery of axonal growth cones that drive growth cone extension and / or may promote microtubule - driven extension by reduction of actin / microtubule coordination . Unfortunately , the role and even the localization of the Arp2 / 3 complex in axonal growth cones is still a matter of debate ( Strasser et al . , 2004 ; Korobova and Svitkina , 2008 ) . Whereas upon Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition , actin organiza - tion in growth cones was only minimally affected and neither lamellipodia protrusion nor de novo ﬁlopodia formation was inhib - ited ( Strasser et al . , 2004 ) , depletion of the Arp2 / 3 complex subunit 930 M . M . Kessels et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 90 ( 2011 ) 926 – 933 Fig . 4 . Cobl - mediated actin nucleation . ( A ) Cobl is a large protein , which is preferentially expressed in the brain and contains several proline - rich domains ( PRD ) , two putative nuclear localization signals ( NLS ) and three C - terminal WH2 domains . ( B ) Cobl - mediated actin nucleation is a powerful mechanism that involves actin interactions of all three WH2 domains . The process seems to be carefully orchestrated in time and space by different afﬁnities of the three WH2 domains for actin monomers and by WH2 domain # 3 being spaced apart from the others by a long , proline - rich linker . ( C ) Cobl - mediated actin nucleation gives rise to linear actin ﬁlaments in in vitro reconstitutions . p34 decreased the rates of lamellipodial protrusion and retrograde ﬂow of neuronal growth cones . Furthermore , the rates of ﬁlopo - dia initiation and the frequency of ﬁlopodia along the growth cone perimeter were found to be reduced ( Korobova and Svitkina , 2008 ) . A very recent report additionally suggests a role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in neuritogenesis and axon deﬁnition ( Gupton and Gertler , 2010 ) . Intriguingly , the excessive axon growth and branching observed upon deﬁciency of N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Strasser et al . , 2004 ; Kakimoto et al . , 2006 ; Pinyol et al . , 2007 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) were also observed in loss - of - function studies of the N - WASP - binding and - activating proteins Abp1 and syndapin I ( Fig . 3 ; Pinyol et al . , 2007 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . This is in line with examinations showing that both proteins are activators of N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin nucleation ( Pinyol et al . , 2007 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . The close physiological relationship of syndapin I with N - WASP in neuromorphogenesis signiﬁcantly distinguishes the brain - enriched protein syndapin I from proteins suggested to have syndapin - related functions , as they also bind to lipids and release N - WASP inhibition in vitro , such as FBP17 / Toca - 1 ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . FBP17 / Toca - 1 loss - of - function failed to pheno - copy N - WASP deﬁciency in hippocampal neurons ( Kakimoto et al . , 2006 ) . More detailed analyses revealed that syndapin I and Abp1 are indeed very speciﬁc modulators of N - WASP in neuromorphogene - sis , as they are crucial for the control of distinct aspects of Arp2 / 3 complex / N - WASP - mediated axonal development , i . e . axon branch - ing and axonal length control , respectively ( Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) . The role of further members of the WASP family in controlling Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin nucleation in early neuromorpho - genesis is far less clear . Whereas Dahl et al . ( 2003 ) demonstrated that WAVE1 knock - out neurons did not show any changes of neu - ronal morphology when analyzed directly in brain sections from WAVE1 knock - out mice and that isolated embryonic neurons from these mice did not have any deﬁcits in neurite formation and did not exhibit differences in neurite number and summarized length , another study reported that neurons isolated from WAVE1 knock - out mice exhibit perturbations in growth cone dynamics and neurite outgrowth ( Soderling et al . , 2007 ) . The sum of axonal and dendritic outgrowth was greatly reduced . Paradoxically , however , deﬁciency for WAVE1 at the same time increased the exten - sion velocity of growth cone lamellipodia ( Soderling et al . , 2007 ) . Considering the importance of WAVE proteins for lamellipodia for - mation in non - neuronal cells ( reviewed in Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) , these data are somewhat unexpected . A potential role for the WAVE complex in axonal outgrowth is corroborated by siRNA - mediated knock - down studies targeting WAVE1 as well as the WAVE complex components Sra - 1 and Nap1 , respectively , in dissociated neuronal cultures of different types . These manipulations resulted in a decrease in length of the longest neurite formed ( Kawano et al . , 2005 ; Yokota et al . , 2007 ; Tahirovic et al . , 2010 ) . The interpretation of these observations is however complicated by the fact that overexpression of WAVE1 similarly led to decreased axon length ( Kawano et al . , 2005 ) . The observation that WAVE1 RNAi , WAVE1 overexpression and knock - down of the WAVE complex component Sra - 1 additionally led to an increased frequency of neurons without an axon ( Kawano et al . , 2005 ) points towards a not yet elucidated , additional role of WAVE1 and / or WAVE complex components in neuritogenesis and neuronal differentiation . Such functions were also suggested by knock - down analyses of the WAVE complex component Nap1 . Cortical neurons with reduced Nap1 levels had reduced dendrite numbers and dendritic branches ( Yokota et al . , 2007 ) . Nap1 gene mutation in mice shows early embryonic lethality but when mutant E9 . 5 telencephalic neuroepithelial cells , which eventually give rise to cortical neurons , were isolated and cultured , Yokota et al .

Overexpression of the actin nucleator Cobl in primary hippocampal neurons leads to excessive neurite formation and neuritic branching . Morphological analyses of hippocampal neurons transfected at DIV4 and ﬁxed two days later show an increase in arborization of Cobl - overexpressing neurons ( C , D ) in comparison to GFP - transfected control cells ( A , B ) visible both by GFP - ﬂuorescence ( A , C ) and immunolabeling of endogenous MAP2 ( B , D ) . Bar , 25 (cid:2) m . Quantitative analyses describing Cobl overexpression phenotypes were reported in Ahuja et al . ( 2007 ) . The number of neurites increased to about 130 % of control and the number of branch points increased to about 180 % of control . The effects were highly signiﬁcant with p < 0 . 001 ( * * * ) . observed that lamellipodia formation , neurite formation and neu - rite extension were severely affected . Formins and Spire Formin - mediated actin nucleation was the ﬁrst Arp2 / 3 complex - independent mechanism of actin ﬁlament formation identiﬁed ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002 ) . Formins have recently emerged as important for the formation of ﬁlopo - dia in non - neuronal cells ( reviewed in Mellor , 2010 ; Faix and Rottner , 2006 ) . The observation that ectopic expression of the formin mDia2 in cortical neurons deﬁcient for all three Ena / VASP proteins ( Mena , VASP and EVL ) rescued the defects in ﬁlopo - dia formation and in the induction and elaboration of neurites ( Dent et al . , 2007 ) suggested that formins might be involved in the formation and propagation of actin - driven structures dur - ing neuritogenesis as well . Unfortunately , until today , little is known about the roles of formins in morphogenesis of neurons , although several proteins of this large group of proteins , such as Delphilin ( Matsuda et al . , 2006 ) , Fhos2short ( Kanaya et al . , 2005 ) , DAAM1 ( Kida et al . , 2004 ) and DAAM2 ( Nakaya et al . , 2004 ) , have been reported to be expressed in the nervous sys - tem . Likewise , the role of the WH2 domain - containing actin nucle - ator Spire , which was shown to work in intimate association with formins through binding to the actin - nucleating FH2 domains ( Quinlan et al . , 2007 ; Pechlivanis et al . , 2009 ) , in the nervous system is not yet clear , although both Spire 1 and Spire 2 are expressed in the brain ( Schumacher et al . , 2004 ) . Cobl The surprisingly restricted phenotypes observed in Arp2 / 3 com - plex loss - of - function studies suggest that – at least in neurons – there must be considerable functional redundancy of the Arp2 / 3 complex with other actin nucleators , which speciﬁcally ensure that neurites are formed , elongated and branched properly to give rise to functional neuronal networks . Cobl , a previously uncharacterized protein , which we identiﬁed in a screen for syndapin I interaction partners , is such an actin nucleator ( Fig . 4 ) . Our analyses revealed that Cobl nucleates actin ﬁlaments using multiple WH2 domains , is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in neuro - morphogenesis ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) . The cobl gene was originally identiﬁed in lacZ gene trap exper - iments . Cobl mRNA was detected in the gastrula organizer and extended towards the axial midline during early embryonic devel - opment . Since the organizer is a small group of embryonal cells that organizes the entire body plan , as it gives rise to the axial midline , the marked accumulation and restriction of Cobl mRNA to the orga - nizer and axial midline structures led to the hypothesis that Cobl may be involved in vertebrate axis formation ( Gasca et al . , 1995 ) . In embryonic , primary hippocampal neurons , Cobl was observed throughout the cell body , the axon and the dendrites . It showed accumulations in both axonal and dendritic growth cones , which are also enriched for F - actin ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) . Overexpression of Cobl led to signiﬁcant increases of both neurite number and branching of the dendritic arbor of primary hippocampal neurons ( Fig . 5 ; Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) . Since a similar phenotype was observed upon triggering excessive actin nucleation by overexpression of the Arp2 / 3 complex activator N - WASP in neurons ( Pinyol et al . , 2007 ) , 932 M . M . Kessels et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 90 ( 2011 ) 926 – 933 this argues for the Cobl - induced effects being a consequence of aberrant actin nucleation in developing neurons . Biochemical reconstitutions showed that Cobl exhibits a very powerful actin nucleation capability residing in its C - terminal part , which contains three WH2 domains . Cobl effectively generated actin ﬁlaments even at nanomolar Cobl concentrations and low actin concentrations . Combined examinations of both the Arp2 / 3 complex and Cobl furthermore suggested that Cobl and the Arp2 / 3 complex act independently ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) . This ﬁnding is in line with the observation that Cobl and the Arp2 / 3 complex gave rise to entirely different actin ﬁlament structures , although they both induced comparable gain - of - function phenotypes in primary hippocampal neurons . Whereas the Arp2 / 3 complex gave rise to 70 ◦ - branched actin ﬁlaments , Cobl promoted the formation of long unbranched actin ﬁlaments , as demonstrated by in vitro recon - stitution of actin ﬁlament formation and visual examination by high - resolution light microscopy ( Fig . 4 ; Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) . Since Cobl mutants , which were demonstrated to not support actin nucleation in in vitro reconstitutions , such as deletions of one of the three WH2 domains , also did not promote neurite formation in primary hippocampal neurons , Cobl - mediated actin nucleation seems to rely on the formation of a trimeric actin nucleus and the pronounced effects of Cobl on neurite formation and dendritic arborization clearly depended on Cobl’s actin nucleation capability ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) . Cobl RNAi in dissociated hippocampal neurons that had entered the stage of forming a dynamic dendritic arbor showed that Cobl not only has the ability to promote protrusions leading to neurite formation and dendritic branching but that Cobl is a crucial com - ponent in proper formation of the dendritic arbor . Both neurite number and even more pronounced dendritic branch point num - bers were highly signiﬁcantly reduced in Cobl - deﬁcient neurons ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) . With the Arp2 / 3 complex being important for proper formation of the axon ( Strasser et al . , 2004 ; Pinyol et al . , 2007 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ) and Cobl being indispensable for proper formation of the dendritic arbor ( Ahuja et al . , 2007 ) , the recent advance in the understanding of the functions of the different actin nucle - ators in early neuronal morphogenesis suggests that neuronal cells differentially use several actin nucleators to steer the complex cytoskeletal reorganizations underlying neuronal shape modula - tion and the formation of neuronal networks – prerequisites for proper brain development and neuronal cell – cell communication .
