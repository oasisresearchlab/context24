In search for novel dynamin inhibitors that suppress actin dynamics more efﬁciently , dynasore analogues were screened . N 0 - [ 4 - ( dipropylamino ) benzylidene ] - 2 - hydrox - ybenzohydrazide ( DBHA ) markedly reduced in vitro actin polymerization , and dose - dependently inhibited phosphatidylserine - stimulated dynamin GTPase activity . DBHA signiﬁcantly suppressed both the recruitment of dynamin 2 to the leading edge in U2OS cells and rufﬂe formation in H1299 cells . Furthermore , DBHA suppressed both the migration and invasion of H1299 cells by approximately 70 % . Furthermore , intratumoral DBHA delivery signiﬁcantly repressed tumor growth . DBHA was much less cytotoxic than dynasore . These results strongly suggest that DBHA inhibits dynamin - dependent actin polymerization by altering the interactions between dynamin and lipid membranes .

Introduction Cancer cell migration and invasion are led by pseudopodia , plasma membrane protrusions generated by the dynamic remodel - ing of actin . Since actin dynamics are regulated by several cytosolic proteins [ 1 ] , small molecule inhibitors targeting these actin - regu - lating proteins may have therapeutic anti - cancer activity . Dynamin , a ﬁssion protein involved in clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis [ 2 – 4 ] , has been implicated in the formation of actin - rich structures , including lamellipodia and dorsal membrane rufﬂes [ 5 – 6 ] , invadopodia [ 7 ] , podosomes [ 8 ] , growth cones [ 9 , 10 ] , and phagocytic cups [ 11 , 12 ] . Dynamins are composed of three isoforms , dynamin 1 – 3 [ 4 ] , which share a common domain struc - ture . Dynamin includes a GTPase domain at N - terminus , a bundle signaling element ( BSE ) , a stalk domain , and a domain with phos - phoinositide - binding pleckstrin homology ( PH ) and C - terminus of dynamin contains proline / arginine - rich domain ( PRD ) [ 13 , 14 ] . The PRD interacts with various proteins that contain SH3 domain . Dynamin GTPase activity is crucial for actin regulation . Expres - sion of the dynamin GTPase - defective mutant , K44A , in HeLa cells alters the arrangement of stress ﬁbers [ 15 ] . Actin ﬁlaments formed in vitro are remodeled upon dynamin - mediated hydrolysis of GTP [ 16 , 17 ] . More recently , we found that dynamin and cortactin polymerize to form a ring - shaped complex , which mechanically bundles actin ﬁlaments by undergoing an open - and - closed motion upon GTP hydrolysis [ 10 ] . Several inhibitors of dynamin GTPase have been used to analyze dynamin - dependent endocytosis [ 18 ] . One of these , dynasore , a non - competitive inhibitor [ 19 ] , destabilizes actin ﬁlaments and inhibits cell migration and invasion [ 20 ] . These results suggest that inhibitors of dynamin GTPase could be potential candidates for anti - cancer drugs . Therefore , we screened novel dynamin inhibi - tors to identify those that inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion . To this end , we developed an in vitro actin polymeriza - tion assay , and assayed dynasore analogues . We found that DBHA inhibited rufﬂe formation and cancer cell migration and invasion . 2 .

Animals Ten - week - old C57BL / 6J male mice were purchased from Shimizu Laboratory Supplies Co . ( Kyoto , Japan ) . Mice were main - tained in a speciﬁc pathogen - free environment at the laboratory animal center of Okayama University , and had free access to food and water in accordance with the Okayama University Animal Re - search Committee Guidelines . 2 . 3 . Cell culture H1299 ( ATCC No ; CRL - 5803 ) , U2OS ( ATCC No ; HTB96 ) , and PC3 ( ATCC No ; CRL - 1435 ) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ; Life Technologies Corp . , CA ) supple - mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Life Technologies Corp . , CA ) at 37 (cid:3) C in humidiﬁed air with a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . 2 . 4 . Immunocytochemistry and rufﬂe formation U2OS cells ( 1 (cid:2) 10 4 cells / coverslip ) were starved in 0 . 2 % FBS / DMEM for more than 16 h , and treated with 10 % FBS / DMEM for 40 min , ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered sal - ine ( PBS ) , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 , and double stained by immunoﬂuorescence as described [ 20 ] . To induce rufﬂe formation , serum - starved H1299 cells were pre - incubated with inhibitors at the indicated concentrations for 30 min , then stimulated with 10 % FBS / DMEM for 10 min at 37 (cid:3) C in the presence of inhibitors . As a negative control , cells were trea - ted with 1 % DMSO . To remove DBHA , the cells were quickly washed twice with PBS , incubated with 0 . 2 % FBS / DMEM for 30 min , and stimulated with 10 % FBS / DMEM for 10 min . Cells showing F - actin - rich membrane extensions were deﬁned as ruf - ﬂe - positive cells [ 21 ] . To assess rufﬂe formation , cells were labeled with rhodamine - phalloidin , and analyzed by ﬂuorescent confocal microscopy as described above . 2 . 5 . In vitro actin assay F - actin formation was quantitatively analyzed using pyrene - actin as described [ 10 , 22 ] . For the visual assays , 1 l M rhoda - mine - actin ( Life Technologies Corp . , CA ) was added to 20 mg / ml of mouse brain cytosol and F - actin formation was induced by the addition of 120 l M liposomes composed of 50 % Phosphatidylser - ine and 50 % Phosphatidylcholine . To examine the effects of the inhibitors , brain cytosol was pre - incubated with 80 l M dynasore or DBHA for 10 min , or with 10 l M cytochalasin D for 5 min ; lipo - somes were then added and the mixture were incubated for 40 min at room temperature . F - actin formation was assayed by ﬂuorescent confocal microscopy . 2 . 6 . Wound healing assay H1299 cells were plated to conﬂuence on glass - bottom dishes ( 35 mm diameter ; IWAKI Glass Co . Ltd . ) , cultured in 0 . 2 % FBS / DMEM for 16 h and then wounded with a plastic pipette tip as previously described [ 23 ] . After washing with 0 . 2 % FBS / DMEM , the cells were incubated for 8 h with 0 . 2 % FBS / DMEM supple - mented with dynasore or DBHA at the indicated concentrations . As a negative control , cells were incubated with 1 % DMSO . The cells were visualized by Giemsa staining , followed by the acquisition of phase contrast images from at least 20 different areas randomly selected area per dish . Areas ﬁlled by cell migration were deter - mined by analyzing the resulting images using Image J software . 2 . 7 . Cell invasion assay Invasion assays were performed in 24 - well Matrigel invasion chambers with 8 l m pores ( BD Biosciences , Bedford , MA ) as de - scribed [ 24 ] . H1299 cells ( 2 . 5 (cid:2) 10 5 cells / well ) were seeded in the upper chamber in serum - free DMEM and DMEM containing 50 % FBS was placed in the bottom chamber . After 8 h , DBHA or dyna - sore was added to both the upper and lower chambers and the cells were incubated for a further 8 h . Cells on the upper side of the membrane were scraped off , whereas cells on the bottom of each membrane were ﬁxed in methanol and stained with toluidine blue . Invasive cells were counted on micrographs of a total of 15 ﬁelds ( ﬁve ﬁelds from each of three independent experiments ) taken at (cid:2) 200 magniﬁcation . 2 . 8 . Dynamin GTPase assay GTP hydrolysis was measured at 1 mM GTP using a colorimetric assay to detect Pi release as previously described [ 25 ] . His - tagged dynamin 1 was expressed using the Bac - to - Bac baculovirus expres - sion system ( Life Technologies ) and puriﬁed as described [ 10 ] . 2 . 9 . In vivo anti - tumor assay Human prostate cancer PC3 cells ( 5 (cid:2) 10 6 cells ) were subcuta - neously injected into the right thigh of male athymic [ nu / nu ] mice ( 6 – 7 weeks - old ) from CLEA Japan , Inc . ( Tokyo , Japan ) . The subcuta - neous tumors were allowed to reach 7 – 13 mm in size and the mice were randomized into 3 groups of ﬁve animals each . Next , the mice were intratumorally treated with the dynasore ( 0 . 5 mg / mouse ) or DBHA ( 0 . 5 mg / mouse ) in 100 l l of vehicle ( 5 % DMSO in PBS ) . As a negative control , the same volume of vehicle was used . The injections were targeted to the center and periphery of the tumor to deliver the agent diffusely . The size of the tumors was measured at the indicated day points and tumor volume was calculated using the formula , 1 / 2 (cid:2) ( the longest diameter ) (cid:2) ( the shortest diameter ) 2 [ 24 ] . 2 . 10 . Statistical analysis DATA were analyzed using KaleidaGraph ( v 4 . 1 ) for Macintosh ( Synergy Software ) to perform statistical analysis . ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD post hoc test were applied . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . DBHA inhibits both in vitro actin polymerization and dynamin GTPase activity We previously demonstrated that dynasore , a speciﬁc inhibitor of dynamin GTPase , suppresses cancer cell migration and invasion and destabilizes actin ﬁlaments [ 20 ] . To identify more effective dynamin inhibitors , dynasore analogues , each at a concentration of 40 l M , were screened in an in vitro actin polymerization assay with pyrene - conjugated actin [ 10 , 21 , 22 ] ( Fig . 1A and B ) . Among the tested compounds , N 0 - [ 4 - ( dipropylamino ) benzylidene ] - 2 - hydroxybenzohydrazide ( DBHA ) ( Fig . 1C ) showed the greatest inhibitory effect on F - actin formation . Treatment of brain cytosol with DBHA inhibited F - actin formation in a dose - dependent man - ner , with (cid:3) 85 % inhibition at 40 l M ( Fig . 1B , D and E ) . IC 50 values were 7 l M for DBHA and 18 l M for dynasore ( Fig . 1E ) . Morpholog - ical analysis consistently demonstrated that treatment of brain 512 H .

Yamada et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 443 ( 2014 ) 511 – 517 513 cytosol with either DBHA or dynasore signiﬁcantly reduced the numbers of long and thick actin ﬁlaments and the bundles induced by phosphatidylserine ( PS ) in vitro ( Fig . 1F ) . Next , we examined the effect of DBHA on dynamin GTPase activity . Binding of the dynamin PH domain to PS or PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 increases the GTPase activity of dynamin [ 26 , 27 ] . DBHA dose - dependently inhibited PS - dependent dynamin GTPase activity , with an IC 50 for DBHA of 26 l M ( Fig . 1G and H ) . Under our experimental conditions , dynasore at 80 l M inhibited PS - dependent GTPase activity by 26 . 7 ± 3 . 1 % ( n = 3 ) , suggesting that DBHA is a more potent dynamin GTPase inhibitor . 3 . 2 . DBHA decreases accumulation of dynamin 2 on the leading edge of plasma membranes Dynamin is recruited to actin - enriched pseudopodia , including leading edges and rufﬂes [ 6 ] . This recruitment is mediated by the interaction between the dynamin PH domain and the phosphoino - sitides in the plasma membrane [ 12 , 28 ] . To determine whether DBHA could cause dynamin dysfunction in vivo , the recruitment of dynamin 2 to pseudopodia in plasma membranes was investi - gated in a osteocarcinoma cell line , U2OS . Upon serum stimulation , U2OS cells formed large numbers of pseudopodia , and both dynamin 2 and cortactin , a marker for membrane rufﬂes [ 6 ] , accumulated at the leading edge ( Fig . 2A a – c ) . Treatment with DBHA prior to serum stimulation markedly reduced the recruit - ment of dynamin 2 to the leading edge ( Fig . 2A d – f ) . Removal of DBHA followed by re - stimulation with serum , again resulted in the recruitment of dynamin 2 to the leading edge , suggesting that the effects of DBHA are reversible ( Fig . 2A g – i ) . The inhibitory effect of DBHA on cells was similar to that of dynasore ( Fig . 2A j – o ) . 3 . 3 . DBHA decreases both migration and invasion of lung cancer cells Since dynamin is required for rufﬂe formation , cancer cell migration and invasion [ 20 , 23 , 29 ] , we next examined whether DBHA inhibits these cellular activities . H1299 cells , a human lung cancer cell line , were incubated with various concentrations of DBHA or dynasore and cells showing rufﬂe formation were as - sessed . Actin - rich rufﬂe formation was dose - dependently inhibited by DBHA with (cid:3) 85 % inhibition at 40 l M ( Fig . 3A and B ) , but reap - peared after washing out DBHA ( Fig . 3B ) . Furthermore , a wound healing assay showed that DBHA dose - dependently suppressed the migration of H1299 cells with (cid:3) 70 % inhibition at 40 l M ( Fig . 3C and D ) . The effect of DBHA on H1299 invasiveness was then examined in a Matrigel invasion chamber . In the absence of DBHA , a signiﬁcant number of H1299 cells were attracted to the high ( 50 % ) concentration of FBS , and invaded through the mem - brane of the chamber ( Fig . 3E and F ) . However , H1299 invasiveness was dose - dependently inhibited by DBHA , with (cid:3) 70 % inhibition at 40 l M ( Fig . 3E and F ) . Next , anti - tumor activity of DBHA was examined in vivo . Tumors of PC3 were formed subcutaneously in mice , and DBHA or dynasore were injected intratumorally . Four days after the treat - ments , signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in the mice treated with dynasore and DBHA in comparison to control treatment with vehicle ( 5 % DMSO / PBS ) ( Fig . 3G ) . Eight days after the treatments , the anti - tumor effect was signiﬁcantly potent in the DBHA treated mice in comparison to the other groups . At the necropsy , we also examined the toxic effects in the three treatment groups and there was no apparent adverse effect in the groups . Finally , the cytotoxicity of DBHA and dynasore was determined . Incubation of H1299 cells with 50 l M dynasore reduced cell viabil - ity by 50 % after for 72 h , whereas incubation with 50 l M DBHA reduced viability by only 15 % .

Yamada et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 443 ( 2014 ) 511 – 517 515 mediated by DBHA was conﬁrmed in PC3 cells , a human prostate prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line . Incubating these cells with 50 l M DBHA for 72 h had no effect on cell viability , whereas incu - bation with 50 l M dynasore reduced viability to 75 % ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , DBHA was much less cytotoxic than dynasore under these experi - mental conditions . 4 . Discussion Dynasore , a dynamin inhibitor , suppresses lamellipodia forma - tion and cancer cell invasion by destabilizing actin ﬁlaments , sug - gesting its potential as an anti - cancer drug [ 20 ] . To identify more potent compounds , we screened dynasore analogues for their ability to inhibit actin polymerization in vitro . We found that DBHA not only inhibited in vitro actin polymerization but also PS - stimu - lated dynamin GTPase activity ( Fig . 1 ) . Thus , DBHA - mediated inhibition of dynamin GTPase likely resulted in reduced actin polymerization . Accumulating evidence indicates that dynamin is a direct or indirect regulator of actin ﬁlaments . Dynamin is required for the formation of actin - based structures such as lamellipodia , rufﬂes , and phagocytic cups [ 6 – 12 ] . Dynamin interacts not only with a variety of actin - regulating proteins such as cortactin , a - actinin 4 , proﬁlin and Abp1 [ 6 , 30 – 32 ] , but also directly with actin ﬁlaments [ 33 ] . Dynamin GTPase activity appears to be essential for its regulation of actin Incubation of actin ﬁlaments with dynamin and cortactin in vitro resulted in the formation of tight actin bundles [ 10 , 17 ] . These actin bundles cross - linked with nucleotide - free dynamin 2 and cortactin , with apparent changes in morphology upon the addition of GTP [ 17 ] . In addition , actin bundles formed in vitro with dynamin 1 / cortactin complexes are more stable in the presence of GTP than GDP , or under nucleotide - free conditions [ 10 ] . Moreover , dynamin GTPase activity is likely involved in regu - lating the actin cytoskeleton in cells . Stress ﬁber rearrangements have been observed in ﬁbroblasts that express dynamin K44A , a GTPase deﬁcient mutant [ 15 ] . Moreover , expression of dynamin K44A in MDCK epithelial cells resulted in increased apical constric - tion [ 34 ] . The presence of the lipid membrane potentiates actin polymer - ization . During in vitro actin polymerization , PS - or phosphoinosi - tide - containing liposomes provide scaffolds for the recruitment of actin - binding proteins , including dynamin , which in turn stimulate actin polymerization on liposomes . Dynasore consistently inhibits liposome - stimulated actin polymerization [ 12 ] . In cells , the recruitment of dynamin to the plasma membrane is essential for the formation of actin - rich structures [ 6 , 12 ] . DBHA decreased the recruitment of dynamin 2 to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2 ) , which may , in turn , have decreased dynamin GTPase activity and dynam - in - stimulated actin polymerization . Dynamin was recently found to be associated with tumor malignancy , particularly tumor cell migration and invasion . For example , up - regulation of dynamin 2 expression potentiates migration and invasion in pancreatic ductal carcinomas [ 23 ] , and tyrosine phosphorylated dynamin 2 enhances the growth and invasiveness of glioblastomas [ 29 ] . Accordingly , dynamin is now regarded as a potential molecular target for anti - cancer therapeu - tics . We found that DBHA inhibited both cancer cell migration and invasion ( Fig . 3 ) , likely by inhibiting dynamin - stimulated actin polymerization . Furthermore , DBHA suppressed tumor more po - tently in comparison to dynasore in the human prostate cancer mouse model with no apparent adverse effect ( Fig . 3G ) . Although DBHA and dynasore showed similar inhibitory activi - ties , DBHA was much less cytotoxic than dynasore in cells ( Fig . 4 ) . In addition to DBHA and dynasore , a series of myristoil trimethyl ammonium bromides ( MiTMABs ) were identiﬁed as potent dyn - amin inhibitors based on their inhibition of dynamin GTPase activ - ity [ 28 ] . MiTMABs cause cytokinesis failure and strongly inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells [ 35 ] . These results are thought to be due to the effect of dynamin on cytokinesis [ 36 ] . In conclusion , we identiﬁed a new dynamin inhibitor , DBHA , which strongly blocked the migration and invasion of cancer cells by inhibiting dynamin - stimulated actin polymerization , but showed low cytotoxicity . Most of molecular targets of current anti - cancer drugs are involved in the processes of cell division or DNA replication . Therefore , DBHA may be a leading compound for an anti - cancer drug that has a novel mechanism of action ; tar - geted for dynamin - dependent actin dynamics . Further studies are needed to determine the precise mechanism ( s ) by which DBHA inhibits actin dynamics .
