This includes 14 structures with a curved geometry such as axon - stabilizing actin rings , actin cages 15 around mitochondria and the cytokinetic actomyosin ring , which are generally 16 assumed to be formed by short linear filaments held together by actin cross - linkers . 17 However , whether individual actin filaments in these structures could be curved and 18 how they may assume a curved geometry remains unknown . Here , we show that 19 “curly” , a region from the IQGAP family of proteins from three different organisms , 20 comprising the actin - binding calponin - homology domain and a C - terminal 21 unstructured domain , stabilizes individual actin filaments in a curved geometry when 22 anchored to lipid membranes . Whereas F - actin is semi - flexible with a persistence 23 length of ~ 10  m , binding of mobile curly within lipid membranes generates actin 24 filament arcs and full rings of high curvature with radii below 1  m . Higher rates of 25 fully formed actin rings are observed in the presence of the actin - binding coiled - coil 26 protein tropomyosin , and also when actin is directly polymerized on lipid membranes 27 decorated with curly . Strikingly , curly induced actin filament rings contract upon the 28 addition of muscle myosin II filaments and expression of curly in mammalian cells 29 leads to highly curved actin structures in the cytoskeleton . Taken together , our work 30 identifies a new mechanism to generate highly curved actin filaments , which opens a 31 new range of possibilities to control actin filament geometries , that can be used , for 32 example , in designing synthetic cytoskeletal structures . 33 34 35 The IQGAP family of proteins plays a key role in actin cytoskeleton regulation including the 36 assembly and function of the contractile actomyosin ring in budding and fission yeasts 37 ( Briggs & Sacks , 2003 ; Eng et al . , 1998 ; Epp & Chant , 1997 ; Tebbs et al . , 2013 ) . To study 38 the mechanism and role of actin binding by the fission yeast IQGAP ( encoded by the rng2 39 gene ) , we utilized a strategy to investigate its function when immobilized on supported lipid 40 bilayers . We chose this approach , since during cytokinesis Rng2 , which binds a number of 41 actomyosin ring proteins , is tethered to the plasma membrane via Mid1 ensuring the 42 formation and anchoring of the cytokinetic ring ( Laplante et al . , 2016 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ; 43 Padmanabhan et al . , 2011 ) . We linked hexa - histidine tagged rng2 protein fragments to 44 supported lipid bilayers containing nickel - chelating lipids ( DOGS - NTA ( Ni 2 + ) ) and observed 45 the binding of fluorescently labelled actin filaments using live total internal reflection 46 fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy as described earlier ( Köster et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 1A ) . The 47 actin - binding calponin homology domain ( CHD ) is located at the N - terminus of Rng2 ( AA 41 - 48 147 ) , and the construct His 6 - Rng2 [ 1 - 189 ] ( subsequently referred to as curly ) containing the 49 CHD and additional 42 amino acids was found to bind actin filaments ( Figure 1B , Figure 1 - 50 figure supplement 1A - C ) . Remarkably , when bound to His 6 - Curly a large fraction of actin 51 filaments formed tightly bent rings ( 21 ± 5 rings per field of view ) with a characteristic 52 curvature C curly = 1 . 7 ± 0 . 5 µm - 1 ( N = 425 ) ( Figure 1 C ; Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 D ; 53 Video 1 ) . To our knowledge , this is an unprecedented phenomenon specific to curly . Binding 54 of other membrane attached actin binding proteins in the same geometry does not 55 appreciably bend actin ( C α - actinin = 0 . 3 ± 0 . 1 µm - 1 , N = 85 ; C EzrinABD = 0 . 5 ± 0 . 3 µm - 1 , N = 127 ) 56 ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 2 A - D ) . Membrane anchored fimbrin has also been shown not to 57 bend actin ( Murrell & Gardel , 2012 ) . 58 59 2 To understand the mechanism leading to actin filament bending and ring formation by curly , 60 we tested the role of different fragments of curly and their orientation as well as curly 61 anchoring to lipid membranes in actin filament bending . Curly mobility within planar lipid 62 membranes was important for actin bending as glass adsorbed , immobilized His 6 - Curly 63 displayed reduced actin bending and ring formation ( C glass = 0 . 6 ± 0 . 3 µm - 1 , N = 138 ) ( Figure 64 2 A , F ) , and when using membrane tethered fluorescently labelled His 6 - SNAP - curly , a weak 65 accumulation of curly under actin filaments could be observed ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 66 1 ) . Next , we generated fragments of curly to discern the regions important for actin binding 67 and bending . We found that the C - terminal region following the CHD ( His6 - Rng2 [ 150 - 250 ] ) 68 alone was able to bind actin filaments without inducing bending ( C [ 150 - 250 ] = 0 . 2 ± 0 . 1 µm - 1 , N 69 = 17 ) ( Figure 2 B ) . Interestingly , a 7AA deletion ( Rng2 [ 1 - 189 ] - Δ ( 154 - 160 ) ) led to a reduced 70 degree of actin binding and bending ( C Δ ( 154 - 160 ) = 0 . 4 ± 0 . 1 µm - 1 , N = 33 ) ( Figure 2 C ) . 71 Similarly , the fragments Rng2 [ 41 - 189 ] and Rng2 [ 1 - 147 ] displayed weaker actin binding and 72 bending compared to curly ( C [ 41 - 189 ] = 0 . 6 ± 0 . 2 µm - 1 , N = 323 ; C [ 1 - 147 ] = 0 . 7 ± 0 . 2 µm - 1 , N = 73 118 ) ( Figure 2 D , E ) . The location of the hexa - histidine tag to link curly to the lipid membrane 74 ( C - terminal hexa - histidine tagged construct Rng2 [ 1 - 189 ] - His 6 ) did not affect actin filament 75 bending ( 25 ± 7 rings per field of view ; C curly - his = 1 . 5 ± 0 . 5 µm - 1 , N = 184 ) ( Figure 2 F ) . Taken 76 together ( Figure 2 G ) , this suggests that curly contains two actin binding sites , one located 77 within the CHD followed by a second within Rng2 [ 148 - 189 ] . Both actin binding sites are 78 necessary for actin bending as neither Rng2 [ 1 - 147 ] nor Rng2 [ 150 - 250 ] caused strong 79 bending . It is very likely that the second actin binding site includes the 7AA Rng2 [ 154 - 160 ] 80 as this unstructured region maps directly to AA 240 - 246 of the dystrophin CH2 domain 81 ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . The first 40 AA of Rng2 are likely to be important for the protein folding 82 and stability , because of which the Rng2 [ 41 - 189 ] construct showed poor actin binding and 83 did not lead to actin bending . 84 85 Careful examination of individual actin filaments bound to membrane tethered His 6 - Curly 86 allowed us to identify the occurrence of discrete kinks of an angle α = 37˚ ± 8˚ ( N = 63 ) along 87 actin filaments during the transition from straight to bent filaments ( Figure 2 - figure 88 supplement 2 A , B ; Video 2 ) . Based on the experimental data and the predicted molecular 89 structure of curly ( Rng2 [ 1 - 189 ] ) we hypothesize that i ) the CHD ( Rng2 [ 41 - 147 ] ) contains at 90 least one actin binding site ( similar to the utrophin actin binding domains ABD2’ ( UTRN [ 84 - 91 94 ] ) and ABD2 ( UTRN [ 107 - 126 ] ) ( Kumari et al . , 2020 ) ) and ii ) the C - terminal extension from 92 the CHD contains an additional actin binding site ( including Rng2 [ 154 - 160 ] ) ( Wang et al . , 93 2004 ) . The latter could lead to a change in the actin subunit orientation within the actin 94 filament similar to the action of cofilin ( Narita , 2020 ) and could lead to overall actin bending 95 when the binding is asymmetric ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 2 C ) . However , in contrast to 96 cofilin , we could not observe any events actin filament severing by curly . 97 98 Next , we studied whether actin bending by curly depended on the orientation of actin 99 filaments by following the landing of actin filaments decorated with labelled capping protein 100 as a plus end marker ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) . We found that the bending was oriented anti - 101 clockwise with respect to the plus end in all instances where the plus end was clearly 102 labelled and the orientation of filament bending could be identified ( Figure 3A , B ; Figure 3 - 103 figure supplement 1 A , B ) . This was observed using both , the N - terminal and C - terminal 104 hexa - histidine tagged curly indicating that the internal sequence of the two actin binding 105 sites within curly sets the chirality of actin bending and not the position of the membrane 106 linker ( Figure 3A , B ; Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 A , B ; Video 3 , 4 ) . Actin filaments 107 appeared to bend concomitant with their landing on the supported lipid bilayer , which 108 indicates that the bending did not require the full actin filament to be tethered to the SLB and 109 underlined the earlier observation that the bending occurred locally . 110 111 To decouple the actin filament bending from the landing of actin filaments , we induced 112 polymerization of actin filaments at planar lipid membranes in the presence of membrane 113 tethered curly ( His 6 - Curly ) by using membrane tethered formin ( His 6 - SpCdc12 ( FH1 - FH2 ) ) , 114 profilin - actin and ATP . Strikingly , polymerizing actin filaments displayed characteristic 115 bending shortly after the onset of polymerization and grew often into full rings ( 44 ± 6 rings 116 per field of view , C formin rings = 1 . 7 ± 0 . 4 µm - 1 , N = 477 ; C formin short = 1 . 1 ± 0 . 3 µm - 1 , N = 125 ) 117 3 ( Figure 3 C , D ; Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 C , D ; Video 5 ) . By contrast , polymerization of 118 actin filaments along SLBs decorated with His 10 - SNAP - EzrinABD did not result in the 119 formation of arcs and rings , establishing that actin filament bending was due to curly and not 120 due to formin ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 E , F ) . These observations showed that actin 121 bending occurs continuously due to the binding of membrane tethered curly and did not 122 require the cross - linking of adjacent ends of the same filament as was observed with the 123 actin cross - linker anillin ( Kučera et al . , 2020 ) . Importantly , the uni - directional bending 124 supports the hypothesis that the binding site of curly with actin filaments defines an 125 orientation , and the propagation of a curved trajectory once established indicates a 126 cooperative process . 127 128 Actin filaments forming the cytokinetic ring in S . pombe are wrapped by the coiled - coil 129 protein tropomyosin ( Cdc8 ) , while the actin cross - linker fimbrin is present outside the 130 cytokinetic ring region in Arp2 / 3 generated actin patches and prevents tropomyosin of 131 binding to actin filaments in these patches ( Skau & Kovar , 2010 ) . To find out whether the 132 actin bending effect of curly is conserved in tropomyosin wrapped actin filaments , we 133 incubated actin filaments with tropomyosin before adding them to His 6 - Curly containing 134 SLBs . Strikingly , addition of tropomyosin to actin filaments increased the frequency of actin 135 ring formation without affecting actin filament curvature ( 38 ± 3 rings per field of view ; 136 C tropomyosin = 1 . 4 ± 0 . 6 µm - 1 , N = 204 ) , while actin filaments incubated with the actin cross - 137 linker fimbrin displayed reduced bending and ring formation ( 3 ± 2 rings per field of view ; 138 C fimbrin = 0 . 6 ± 0 . 4 µm - 1 , N = 407 ) ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 2 A - E ; Video 6 ) . Thus , the 139 tropomyosin Cdc8 and curly cooperate to enhance actin filament bending and ring formation . 140 141 Interestingly , we could observe that long actin filaments coated with tropomyosin would trace 142 consecutive rings around the same center while landing on curly decorated lipid 143 membranes . Subtraction of the image after completion of the first round of actin filament 144 landing into a ring from the image after the second round revealed that the second ring 145 occupied the interior space of the first ring . In line with that , comparison of the intensity 146 profiles perpendicular to the actin filament of the first and second round of ring formation 147 revealed a widening of the profile towards the interior of the ring ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 148 3 A , B ) . A similar effect could be observed in examples of actin filaments polymerized by 149 membrane tethered formin in the presence of membrane tethered curly ( Figure 3 - figure 150 supplement 3 C , D ) . This would suggest that curly can arrange long actin filaments into an 151 inward oriented spiral . 152 153 To test whether the curly - induced actin rings can contract , we added rabbit skeletal muscle 154 myosin II filaments and ATP to curly bound actin filaments and followed actin filament 155 dynamics over time . After the myosin II filaments landed on the actin filaments , straight actin 156 filaments were propelled by myosin action and eventually started to bend and displayed a 157 variety of dynamics including translation , rotation and finally contraction of actin rings ( Figure 158 3 E , Figure 3 - figure supplement 4 A , Video 7 ) . Interestingly , most actin rings displayed a 159 counter - clockwise rotation ( 34 / 36 cases ) and the contraction was slow with v contraction = 3 ± 160 0 . 7 nm s - 1 ( N = 29 ) ( Figure 3 F ; Video 8 ) . Despite reaching high curvatures of C myoII = 2 . 8 ± 161 0 . 7 µm - 1 ( N = 342 ) with a maximum of 6 . 3 µm - 1 there was no evidence of breaking of actin 162 filaments during the contraction process ( Figure 3 G ) . Additionally , the myosin II induced 163 flows of actin filaments increased the formation of actin rings significantly ( 79 ± 8 rings per 164 field of view ) indicating that myosin II filament induced actin filament sliding enhanced the 165 ability of membrane anchored curly to generate actin filament bending ( Figure 3 - figure 166 supplement 4 B , C ) . In line with this , actin filament rings displayed increased localization of 167 fluorescently labelled curly after addition of myosin II filaments action indicating that curly 168 showed an increased affinity for highly bent actin and / or stabilized actin filaments at higher 169 curvatures ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 4 D ) . Interestingly , despite the observed high 170 curvatures of actin filaments upon myosin II filament action , severing of actin filament was 171 not observed suggesting that binding of curly reduces the rigidity of actin filaments . 172 173 It was not obvious that addition of myosin II filaments would lead to actin ring constriction 174 without the addition of any cross - linkers or other factors . When taking into account that curly 175 4 arranges actin filaments into an inward spiral , a possible explanation for actin ring 176 constriction would be that the myosin II filament acts both as a cross - linker and motor 177 protein : one end of the myosin II filament sits at the actin filament plus end while other 178 myosin head domains of the same myosin II filament pull along the same actin filament to 179 travel towards the plus end leading to constriction ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 4 E ) . This 180 would result in sub - optimal myosin head orientations towards the actin filament , which could 181 explain the observed slow constriction rates that were orders of magnitude slower than the 182 reported values for actin propulsion by myosin II in motility assays ( Toyoshima et al . , 1990 ) . 183 184 Since Rng2 belongs to the IQGAP protein family , we tested the N - terminal hexa - histidine 185 tagged fragments of the IQGAP proteins Iqg1 [ 1 - 330 ] ( S . cerevisiae ) and IQGAP1 [ 1 - 678 ] ( H . 186 sapiens ) and found that the bending of actin filaments was conserved ( C S . C . = 1 . 1 ± 0 . 4 µm - 1 ; 187 N = 110 ; C H . S . = 1 . 0 ± 0 . 2 µm - 1 ; N = 290 ) ( Figure 4 A - C ) . Comparison of the available crystal 188 structures of H . sapiens IQGAP1 [ 28 - 190 ] with S . pombe Rng2 [ 32 - 190 ] indicates a high 189 similarity between the two ( Figure 4 - figure supplement 1 ) . 190 191 Finally , to test the effect of curly on the actin cortex in cells , we expressed curly - EGFP in the 192 mammalian cell lines HEK293T and RPE - 1 , which resulted in obvious changes in the actin 193 cortex architecture with prominent occurrence of curved actin filaments and bundles with 194 curvatures of C HEK293T = 2 . 3 ± 0 . 4 µm - 1 ( N = 91 from 14 cells ) , and C RPE - 1 = 1 . 9 ± 0 . 6 µm - 1 ( N 195 = 113 from 11 cells ) ( Figure 4D - F ) . Co - expression with LifeAct - mCherry confirmed that 196 EGFP - Curly bound to actin filaments in cells ( Figure 4 - figure supplement 2 ) . These 197 experiments established that curly could instructively reorganize actin filaments / networks 198 into curved structures and rings . 199 200 201 Discussion 202 203 Our results show that the N - terminal CHD of IQGAP proteins induces actin filament bending 204 when tethered to lipid membranes , which constitutes a new type of actin binding protein and 205 could be an important link between actin and membrane geometries . Recently , Uyeda and 206 colleagues reported that curly ( Rng2 [ 1 - 189 ] ) in solution can induce kinks at random 207 locations of the actin filament ( Hayakawa et al . , 2020 ) . This together with our results 208 indicates that curly that is constrained to a lipid membrane , would bind asymmetrically to 209 actin filaments leading to a succession of kinks towards the same direction leading to curling 210 of the actin filaments into rings in the plane of the lipid membrane . With an estimated His 6 - 211 Curly surface density on SLBs of 5000 µm - 2 ( Köster et al . , 2016 ; Nye & Groves , 2008 ) the 212 approximated curly to actin ratio would be 1 : 7 or higher . The mobility of curly on the SLB 213 allowing accumulation under actin filaments was important for continuous actin filament 214 bending into rings as glass - immobilized curly failed to generate rings . In line with this , curly 215 in solution , i . e . in the absence of a substrate providing confinement , did not lead to 216 persistent bending of actin filaments ( Hayakawa et al . , 2020 ) . Interestingly , individual 217 transient kinks of an average angle of 37˚ ± 8˚ could be observed during actin filament 218 binding to curly , but it remained unclear whether this is caused by binding of single or 219 multiple proteins . Based on the data of the Utrophin - CHD actin binding sites ( Kumari et al . , 220 2020 ) together with the newly identified actin binding region withing Rng2 [ 150 - 189 ] , the local 221 change of the actin filament structure induced by curly could be similar to the effect of cofilin 222 ( Narita , 2020 ) allowing the formation of actin rings with curvatures that would be 223 energetically unfavorable given the actin filament persistence length of 10 µm ( De La Cruz & 224 Gardel , 2015 ) . The increased flexibility of actin filaments is highlighted by the fact that 225 addition of rabbit muscle myosin II filaments resulted in actin ring constriction without any 226 evidence for filament rupture up to curvatures of 6 . 3 µm - 1 which is much higher than 227 expected for actin alone ( Taylor et al . , 2000 ) . This mechanism of actin ring formation stands 228 out as it bends individual actin filaments in contrast to other reported systems that generate 229 actin rings made of bundles of actin filaments ( Litschel et al . , 2020 ; Mavrakis et al . , 2014 ; 230 Mishra et al . , 2013 ; Way et al . , 1995 ) . 231 232 5 In case of S . pombe cytokinetic ring formation , Rng2 is localized at the plasma membrane 233 by interaction with Mid1 via its C - terminal RAS - GAP and GRD domains ( Almonacid et al . , 234 2011 ; Padmanabhan et al . , 2011 ) leaving the N - terminal CHD facing the cytoplasm and 235 allowing interaction with actin filaments . Formin based polymerization of actin filaments is 236 essential for cytokinetic ring formation and binding of the tropomyosin Cdc8 supports myosin 237 driven cytokinetic ring contraction . Our work recapitulates that this minimal set of proteins 238 can indeed generate and stabilize actin filaments of the right curvature to form the 239 cytokinetic ring along the short axis of S . pombe . Even though electron microscopy data of 240 the cytokinetic ring does not provide clear evidence of bent actin filaments ( Swulius et al . , 241 2018 ) , this mechanism could work together with other processes such as cross - linkers 242 ensuring the binding of fresh actin filaments along existing ones ( Li & Munro , 2020 ) to drive 243 robust formation of cytokinetic rings . 244 245 Highly bent actin filament structures are most likely important for many cellular structures 246 such as axons ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2019 ; Xu et al . , 2013 ) and mitochondrial actin cages 247 ( Kruppa et al . , 2018 ) , but the molecular mechanisms leading to their formation are still poorly 248 understood . Future work could provide insights whether curly plays a role in actin ring 249 formation in axons and around mitochondria . In addition , our system of membrane bound 250 curly , actin filaments , and myosin II filaments constitutes a minimalistic system for actin ring 251 formation and constriction and could be used in future to design synthetic dividing vesicles 252 and further exiting active membrane - cortex systems . 253 254 255 Materials and Methods : 256 257 Cloning and Protein purification 258 259 S . pombe Rng2 fragments , Fim1 , Cdc12 ( FH1 - FH2 ) and S . cerevisiae Iqg1 were amplified 260 from cDNA library and genomic DNA respectively . Amplified fragments were cloned into pET 261 ( 6His ) and pGEX ( GST ) based vectors using Gibson cloning method ( NEB builder , E5520S ) . 262 Plasmids used in this study is listed in Table S1 . 263 264 All protein expression plasmids were transformed into E . coli BL21 - ( DE3 ) . Single colony was 265 inoculated in 20 ml of LB media supplemented with appropriate antibiotic ( pET - Kanamycin ; 266 pGEX - Ampicillin ) .

The 279 lysates were centrifuged at 14000 r . p . m , 30 min , 4 °C and the clarified lysate was transferred 280 to a 15 - ml tube . The 400 μl slurry of HisPur™ Ni - NTA agarose resin ( cat . no . 88221 , Thermo 281 fisher ) was washed with wash buffer ( 5x ) ( 50 mM Napi ( pH 7 . 6 ) , 300 mM NaCl , 30mM 282 Imidazole pH 7 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT ) before the lysate was added . The clarified 283 lysate was added to the washed Ni - NTA resin and incubated for 2h at 4 °C .

Each fraction was assessed by SDS – polyacrylamide gel 288 electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) . The eluates ( E1 - E3 ) were pooled , concentrated and buffer 289 exchanged into the protein storage buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT 290 6 and 10 % glycerol ) using a PD MiniTrap G - 25 sephadex columns ( GE Healthcare ) and the 291 protein was stored at −80 °C . The protein concentration was estimated by UV280 and by 292 comparing known quantities of BSA standards on an SDS – PAGE gel . 293 294 GST tagged protein ( GST - Fim1 ) purification : Cell pellets for purification were thawed on ice 295 for 10 minutes .

After sonication cell lysate was incubated with 0 . 5 % Triton - X - 100 for 20 299 minutes on ice . The lysates were centrifuged at 22000xg , 30 min , 4 °C and the clarified 300 lysate was transferred to a 15 - ml tube . The 400 μl slurry of glutathione sepharose - 4B resin 301 ( cat . no . GE17 - 0756 - 01 , GE ) was washed with wash buffer ( 5x ) ( PBS , 0 . 5 mM EDTA and 302 1 mM DTT ) before the lysate was added . The clarified lysate was added to the washed 303 glutathione sepharose resin and incubated for 2 - 3h at 4 °C . After incubation with sepharose 304 resin , beads were washed with wash buffer 6 - 8 times in poly - prep chromatography columns 305 ( BIO - RAD laboratories Inc ) . Protein was eluted using GST elution buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl 306 pH8 . 0 and 10 mM glutathione ) . Purified protein sample was quantified and stored in the 307 storage buffer as described above in the previous section . 308 309 Acetylation mimicking version of tropomyosin ( ASCdc8 ) was expressed in BL21 - DE3 and 310 protein was purified by boiling and precipitation method as described earlier ( Palani et al . , 311 2019 ; Skoumpla et al . , 2007 ) . Purified tropomyosin was dialyzed against the storage buffer 312 ( 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , and 1 mM DTT ) , flash frozen in liquid N2 and 313 stored at - 80 °C . 314 315 SNAP labelling ( SNAP - Surface® 549 , S9112S , NEB ) of capping protein - beta and Rng2 1 - 316 189 was performed as per the manufactures protocol . 317 318 Co - sedimentation assay and Immunoblot 319 320 Co - sedimentation assays were performed at 25°C by mixing 3 µM actin with different Rng2 321 fragments , ScIqg1 ( 1 - 330 ) and Hs IGAP1 ( 1 - 678 ) , and then spun at 100 , 000 g ( high speed ) 322 for 20 min at 25°C . Equal volumes of supernatant and pellet were separated by 12 % SDS - 323 PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie blue ( SimplyBlueStain , Invitrogen ) or immunoblotted . 324 For western analysis , equal volumes of each sample were diluted in 1 × Laemmli buffer ( Bio - 325 Rad ) . Samples were run on a hand cast 10 - well 12 % acrylamide gels ( Bio - Rad ) , transferred 326 onto nitro cellulose membranes and blotted with 1 : 1000 Anti - His - HRP ( 6xHis Epitope TAG , 327 Cat . no . sc - 8036 HRP , Santa Cruz Inc ) and 1 : 500 anti - actin - HRP ( cat . no . sc - 47778 HRP , 328 Santa Cruz Inc ) . Signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Clarity western 329 ECL , Bio - Rad ) imaged on a ChemiDoc MP ( Bio - Rad ) . 330 331 Mammalian expression 332 333 S . pombe Rng2 fragment ( 1 - 189 ) was cloned into pCDNA3 . 1 - eGFP using gibson cloning 334 method . HEK293 and RPE1 cells were transiently transfected with pCDNA3 containing 335 SpRng2 ( 1 - 189 ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( cat . no . 11668019 , Life Technologies ) following 336 manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were transfected at ∼ 70 % confluency for 24 h before the 337 experiments . For each imaging condition , 500 , 000 cells were transfected with 1 µg of DNA . 338 Cells were seeded and imaged on µ - Dish 35 mm ( cat . no . 81156 , IBIDI ) . Before imaging , the 339 culture medium was replaced with phenol red – free DMEM ( Opti - MEM , cat . no . 31985062 , 340 Life Technologies ) . Images were taken using spinning disk microscope with a 100× Apo 341 objective , NA 1 . 4 . 342 343 In vitro assay and Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy 344 345 Supported Lipid Bilayer and Experimental Chamber Preparation 346 The sample preparation , experimental conditions and lipid composition were similar to the 347 ones described in previous work [ Koester et al , 2016 ] . Glass coverslips ( # 1 . 5 borosilicate , 348 7 Menzel , cat . no . 11348503 , Fisher Scientific ) for SLB formation were cleaned with 349 Hellmanex III ( Hellma Analytics , cat . No . Z805939 , Merck ) following the manufacturer ' s 350 instructions followed by thorough rinses with EtOH and MilliQ water and blow dried with N2 351 gas . For the experimental chamber , 0 . 2 ml PCR tubes ( cat . no . I1402 - 8100 , Starlab ) were 352 cut to remove the lid and conical bottom part . The remaining ring was stuck to the cleaned 353 glass using UV glue ( cat . no . NOA88 , Norland Products ) and three minutes curing by 354 intense UV light at 265 nm ( UV Stratalinker 2400 , Stratagene ) . Freshly cleaned and 355 assembled chambers were directly used for experiments . 356 Supported lipid bilayers ( SLB ) containing 98 % DOPC ( cat . no . 850375 , Avanti Polar Lipids ) 357 and 2 % DGS - NTA ( Ni2 + ) ( cat . no . 790404 , Avanti Polar Lipids ) lipids were formed by fusion 358 of small uni - lamellar vesicles ( SUV ) that were prepared by lipid extrusion using a membrane 359 with 100 nm pore size ( cat . no . 610000 , Avanti Polar Lipids ) . SLBs were formed by addition 360 of 10 µl of SUV mix ( at 4 mM lipid concentration ) to chambers filled with 90 µl KMEH ( 50 mM 361 KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 2 ) and incubation for 30 min . Prior to 362 addition of other proteins , the SLBs were washed 10 times by buffer exchange ( always 363 leaving 20 µl on top of the SLB to avoid damage by drying ) . We tested the formation of lipid 364 bilayers and the mobility of lipids in control samples by following the recovery of 365 fluorescence signal after photobleaching of hexa - histidine tagged GFP ( His 6 - GFP ) as 366 described in ( Köster et al . , 2016 ) . 367 368 Actin filament polymerization and tethering to SLBs 369 Actin was purified from muscle acetone powder form rabbit ( cat . no . M6890 , Merck ) and 370 labelled with Alexa488 - maleimide ( cat . no . A10254 , Thermo Fisher ) following standard 371 protocols ( Köster et al . , 2016 ; Pardee & Spudich , 1982 ) . 372 In a typical experiment , actin filaments were polymerized in parallel to SLB formation to 373 ensure that all components of the experiment were freshly assembled before starting 374 imaging . First 10 % vol of 10x ME buffer ( 100 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 2 ) were mixed 375 with unlabeled and labeled G - actin ( to a final label ratio of 20 % ) , optionally supplemented 376 with labelled capping protein in G - actin buffer ( 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 2mM Tris , 0 . 5 mM 377 TCEP - HCl , pH 7 . 2 ) to a final G - actin concentration of 10 µM and incubated for 2 min to 378 replace G - actin bound Ca 2 + ions with Mg 2 + ions . Polymerization of actin filaments was 379 induced by addition of an equal amount of 2x KMEH buffer supplemented with 2 mM Mg - 380 ATP bringing the G - actin concentration to 5 µM . After 30 min incubation time , actin filaments 381 were added to the SLBs using blunt - cut pipette tips at a corresponding G - actin concentration 382 of 100 nM ( to ensure a homogenous mix of actin filaments , 2 µl of actin filament solution was 383 mixed in 18 µl KMEH and then added to the SLB containing 80 µl KMEH ) . After 10 min of 384 incubation , His 6 - Curly or other variants of histidine - tagged actin binding proteins at a final 385 concentration of 10 nM were added and a short time after ( 1 - 5 min ) binding of actin to the 386 SLB could be observed using TIRF microscopy . 387 388 In experiments with formin , the SLB was first incubated with 10 nM His 6 - SpCdc12 ( FH1 - FH2 ) 389 and 10 nM His 6 - Curly for 20 min , then washed twice with KMEH . During the incubation time , 390 10 % vol of 10x ME buffer was mixed with unlabeled and labeled G - actin at 4 µM ( final label 391 ratio of 20 % ) together with 5 µM profilin and incubated for 5 min prior to addition to the SLB 392 and imaging with TIRF microscopy . 393 394 In experiments with tropomyosin or fimbrin , actin filaments ( C G - actin = 1 µM ) were incubated 395 with tropomyosin at a 1 : 3 protein concentration ratio or with fimbrin at a 3 : 2 protein 396 concentration ratio for 15 min prior to addition to the SLB ( Palani et al . , 2019 ) . 397 398 In experiments with muscle myosin II filaments , we prepared muscle myosin II filaments by 399 diluting the stock of muscle myosin II proteins ( rabbit , m . psoas , cat . no . 8326 - 01 , Hypermol ) 400 ( C myoII = 20 µM ; 500mM KCl , 1mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 0 ) 10 - times with 401 MilliQ water to drop the KCl concentration to 50 mM and incubated for 5 min to ensure 402 myosin filament formation . Myosin II filaments were further diluted in KMEH to 200 nM and 403 added to the actin filaments bound to the SLB by His 6 - Curly by replacing 1 / 10 of the sample 404 buffer with the myosin II filament solution and supplemented with 0 . 1 mM Mg - ATP as well as 405 a mix of 1 mM Trolox ( cat . no . 648471 , Merck ) , 2 mM protocatechuic acid ( cat . no . 406 8 03930590 , Merck ) and 0 . 1 µM protocatechuate 3 , 4 - dioxygenase ( cat . no . P8279 , Merck ) to 407 minimize photobleaching . To summarize , the final buffer composition was 50mM KCl , 2mM 408 MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 20mM HEPES , 0 . 1mM ATP , 1 mM Trolox , 2 mM protocatechuic acid 409 and 0 . 1 µM protocatechuate 3 , 4 - dioxygenase at pH 7 . 2 containing actin filaments ( C G - actin = 410 100 nM ) and myosin II filaments ( C myoII = 20 nM ) . It was important to keep the pH at 7 . 2 , as 411 changes in pH would affect motor activity . As reported earlier , myosin filaments started to 412 show actin network remodeling activity after about 10 - 15 min of incubation ( Köster et al . , 413 2016 ; Mosby et al . , 2020 ) . 414 415 TIRF microscopy 416 Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti - E / B microscope equipped with perfect focus 417 system , a Ti - E TIRF illuminator ( CW laser lines : 488nm , 561nm and 640nm ) and a Zyla 418 sCMOS 4 . 2 camera ( Andor , Oxford Instruments , UK ) controlled by Andor iQ3 software 419 ( https : / / andor . oxinst . com / products / iq - live - cell - imaging - software / ) . 420 421 Image analysis 422 Images were analyzed using ImageJ ( http : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij ) . 423 Curvature was measured by fitting ellipses to match the actin filament contour by hand , 424 while measuring first fully formed rings before curved actin filament segments and by going 425 from the highest curvatures down to lower curvatures in each image with a cut off for 426 measurements at curvatures smaller than 0 . 1 µm - 1 or at 30 - 40 measurements per image 427 ( see examples in Figure 1 – figure supplement 1D ; Figure 1 - figure supplement 2B ) . 428 To measure the angle of kinks in individual actin filaments , cropped images of individual 429 actin filaments were processed with a Sobel filter ( part of the Mosaic suit for ImageJ , 430 http : / / mosaic . mpi - cbg . de / ? q = downloads / imageJ ) to highlight the actin filament center , and 431 the angles were measured manually with the ImageJ angle tool . 432 The actin ring contraction rate upon myosin II filament action was measured by generating 433 kymographs based on a line ( 3 pixels width ) dividing the ring into two equal halves . 434 435 Data plotting and statistics 436 Graphs were generated using OriginPro ( version 2019b , OriginLab , USA ) . Plots depict 437 individual data points , mean ( circle ) , median ( central line ) and standard deviation ( top and 438 bottom lines ) . 439 440 Acknowledgement 441 The authors would like to thank Dr .
