Actin polymerisation is primarily 14 governed by monomer association and dissociation occurring at the rapid - growing end called the 15 barbed end , which generates the force to push the plasma membrane forward . Individual actin 16 filaments bind to one nucleotide and its hydrolysis energy is used to maintain the filamentous 17 form by changing the characteristics of the subunits . The asymmetry of the individual actin 18 filaments is also important for detecting the asymmetry of the cell . However , asymmetry at the 19 subunit level including conformational and temporal changes in actin filaments has not been 20 visualized yet . Here , we used “Förster ( or fluorescence ) resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - actin 21 filament” by copolymerising an equal amount of donor and acceptor labelled actin . FRET 22 efficiency change was measured along each actin filament under a light microscope . The FRET 23 efficiency was lower near the end region than in the interior regions . Fluctuations in the FRET 24 efficiency ( f FRET ) were used to monitor local flexibilities along each actin filament . The f FRET was 25 larger near the end region than the interior region . Our quantified data showed that spatial change 26 of f FRET along actin filaments was rapidly decayed from the barbed end from near the pointed end 27 toward internal region , suggesting that the behaviour of actin subunits near ends is affected from 28 each end . Our result revealed that actin filaments have different orientations locally . These 29 orientations appear when actin forms filaments , which may contribute the cell motility . 30 1 Introduction 31 Actin polymerisation and depolymerisation dynamics are essential for cell motility . Under 32 physiological conditions , polymerisation mainly occurs at the barbed end with ~ 18 times tighter 33 binding affinity than the other end called the pointed end . Each actin molecule binds to the ends 34 of the actin filaments through their intrinsic binding sites . Consequently , the actin subunits align 35 and form a filament facing the same direction . Thus , for filament polarity , the binding sites 36 linking each actin subunit are crucial ; though this alignment might occasionally fail when the 37 filament size is very small ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ; Kabsch et al . , 1990 ; Horan et al . , 2020 ) . Each 38 actin can bind and hydrolyse ATP as the polymerisation progresses . The incorporated actin 39 subunits contain ADP - Pi - actin , which is the most stable form ( Fujiwara et al . , 2007 ) . With the 40 slow dissociation of ɤ - phosphate ( Pi ) ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) , the bound nucleotide 41 becomes ADP , and the actin subunit dissociates from the terminal end of the filaments , a process 42 Breathing of actin filaments 2 known as depolymerisation . ATP hydrolysis related to ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) 43 polymerisation dynamics is often expressed as “aging factors” of actin filaments . Actin aging 44 alters filament asymmetry and properties such as torsional and bending rigidity , bundling , and 45 severing ( Pollard , 1984 ; Carlier et al . , 1986 ; Kinosian et al . , 1993 ; Winkelman et al . , 2016 ; 46 Bibeau et al . , 2021 ) . The actin - binding protein ADF / cofilin senses the asymmetry of actin 47 filaments via ATP hydrolysis . It binds cooperatively to the side of actin filaments , with a change 48 in binding affinity based on the nucleotide state and tension of the actin filaments ( Hayakawa et 49 al . , 2011 ; Bibeau et al . , 2021 ) . Besides , the ADF / cofilin - bound actin subunit altered the 50 conformation of the C - form of the actin subunit ( Tanaka et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , understanding 51 the asymmetry of actin filaments is a crucial regulatory mechanism for the actin cytoskeleton . 52 However , the status of actin subunits in each actin filament is not fully understood , because the 53 dynamic behaviour of actin subunits in the filament is not easy to visualise in real - time at a single 54 filament level . Instead , recent structural biology studies using cryoEM , crystal structure , all - atom 55 simulations , and molecular dynamics calculations have unveiled the molecular status of actin 56 subunits in filaments related to ATP hydrolysis . CryoEM studies have revealed that the domain 57 binding and canonical actin interactions , especially the multiple interactions of subdomain - 3 , are 58 the key to the binding of subdomain - 2 of the adjacent actin subunit ( Galkin et al . , 2015 ; Chou and 59 Pollard , 2019 ) . Oda et . al . demonstrated by cluster analysis using rigid bodies of the actin 60 structure , that the structure of actin in the filament fluctuates with greater fluctuations observed in 61 the monomeric actin ( G - actin ) structure ( Oda et al . , 2019 ) . All - atom simulations suggest that the 62 conformational fluctuation of ~ 100 actin subunits from the terminal ends is larger than the interior 63 actin subunits ( Zsolnay et al . , 2020 ) . The authors described that the pointed end subunits were 64 very rigid concerning each other in the ADP state , in contrast to the loosely attached and flexible 65 ATP - bound barbed ends . Although this is an important finding for understanding the dynamics of 66 actin at local positions along the actin filament , the source data is derived from structural 67 information , which possibly misses data from temporal information . 68 Actin filament aging was visualized using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) 69 microscope ( Jégou et al . , 2011 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2018 ) . The depolymerization process was initiated 70 by washing the free actin monomers . Slow depolymerization , corresponding to ADP - Pi bound 71 actin subunits , was followed by fast depolymerization , corresponding to ADP - bound actin 72 subunits . These results confirmed that due to ATP hydrolysis , the terminal actin subunits tend to 73 bind ADP - Pi and the interior actin subunits bind ADP . These researches strongly suggest that the 74 conformation of an actin filament is not same . Rather , dozens of actin subunits at each terminal 75 end show different dynamics from the interior actin subunits . In this study , we investigated 76 whether there is a difference in conformational fluctuations along actin filaments by monitoring 77 fluorescence fluctuations . 78 FRET is a potent approach for measuring the distance between the donor and acceptor using 79 fluorescence intensity , enabling us to trace conformational changes at the single - molecule level 80 ( Ha et al . , 2002 ; Kozuka et al . , 2006 ; Lam et al . , 2010 ; Santoso et al . , 2010 ; Morimatsu et al . , 81 2012 ; Noguchi et al . , 2015 ) . When the distance between the donor and acceptor is sufficiently 82 long , the donor fluorescent signal can be detected . Whereas , the donor signal becomes low when 83 the distance is short , because the fluorescent energy of the donor is transferred to the acceptor . 84 FRET efficiency can be inversely proportional to the distance . FRET efficiency is largely 85 observed in the distance range of 3 – 8 nm and is inversely proportional to the sixth power of 86 distance ( Kozuka et al . , 2006 ; Hirata and Kiyokawa , 2016 ) . Here , we observed that FRET - actin 87 filaments were formed by mixing Dylight 550 - and Dylight 650 - labeled actins , and the FRET 88 fluctuation occurring in one actin filament was measured under a fluorescence microscope . This 89 approach enabled us to obtain spatiotemporal information on the FRET efficiency . The 90 fluctuation in FRET efficiency ( f FRET ) was larger at both ends than in the interior of the actin 91 filaments and decreased as it approached the interior regions . At the barbed ends , the decay was 92 faster than at the pointed ends , although the magnitude of the fluctuation was larger at the pointed 93 Breathing of actin filaments 3 ends . Our results suggest that actin regulators sense differences in molecular dynamics at both 94 ends of actin filaments , which may alter the kinetics . 95 2 Materials and methods 96 2 . 1 Proteins 97 Actin was eluted from acetone powder of rabbit or chicken skeletal muscle with G - buffer ( 2 mM 98 Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) in the presence of 1 mM DTT based on the 99 previous literature ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) Spudich and Watt , 1971 . After acetone powder was 100 removed from the eluate with 3 - fold of filter paper ( No . 1 ( Avantic , Japan ) ) attached to aspiration 101 at 4 °C , contaminations were removed by ultracentrifugation ( 223 , 000 × g rpm for 40 min at 102 4 °C ) . The supernatant was polymerised by adding the final 1 mM ATP , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM 103 KCl and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h . The Polymerised actin was pelleted by ultracentrifugation 104 ( 223 , 000 × g at 25 °C for 1 h ) , resuspended with G - buffer with 1 mM DL - Dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 105 and dialysed in G - buffer overnight on ice . Large contaminations and non - depolymerized actin 106 were removed by ultracentrifugation ( 40 , 000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h ) . Monomeric actin ( G - actin ) was 107 loaded onto a 1 × 7 cm desalting column ( Toyopeal 40S - HW , TOSOH , Japan ) equilibrated with 1 108 mM ATP pH 7 . 0 and 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 . The peak fraction was pooled and the concentration of 109 purified actin was determined by differences in extinction coefficients between 310 and 290 nm , 110 namely 0 . 62 ( ε 290 - ε 310 = 0 . 62 ) . 111 G - actin was rapidly and well mixed with 9 . 2 mM of Dylight 550 - maleimide or Dylight 650 - 112 maleimide ( Thermo Scientific , United States ) that were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide for a few 113 minutes ( to be an equal molar ratio ) subsequently mixed and incubated at 4 °C overnight in dark . 114 The labelling process was stopped by the addition of 28 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol . The 115 concentration of labelled actin was measured at 290 nm and 557 or 655 nm was used for 116 absorbance of Dylight 550 or Dylight 650 with molar extinction coefficients of 150 , 000 or 117 250 , 000 . The ratio of labelled actin to total actin was calculated using correction factors of 0 . 081 118 for Dylight 550 and 0 . 037 for Dylight 650 . 119 Biotinylated actin was prepared by mixing G - actin and biotin - PE - maleimide ( Dojindo , Japan ) . 120 Biotin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , and added in an equal molar ratio to actin , 121 and incubated overnight at 4 °C using an end - end mixer . The free biotin was removed using a 122 column ( PD - 25 , Cytiva , Japan ) . The column was equilibrated with 1 mM ATP pH 7 . 0 and 0 . 1 123 mM CaCl 2 before loading labelled actin . The concentration of biotinylated actin was the same as 124 that of actin by considering that all actin was biotinylated . 125 To prepare for FRET conditions , 24  M actin stock , 30 % Dylight 550 - maleimide - actin , 30 % 126 Dy650 - maleimide - actin , 1 % biotinylated actin , and 39 % non - labelled actin were mixed . 127 Afterward , the 5× polymerisation buffer ( final10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM 128 ATP , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 1 mM EGTA , pH 9 . 1 ) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C . 129 Phalloidin - bound actin was prepared by adding 2 mM phalloidin to 24  M polymerised actin for 130 a 1 : 1 molar ratio and incubated overnight in dark at 4 °C . Anti - biotin antibody , gelsolin from 131 bovine plasma , goat anti - gelsolin antibody , anti - Rat IgG were purchased from Sigma Aldrich , 132 Japan . 133 2 . 2 Glass Preparation 134 The glasses for the observation chambers were prepared as described previously ( Ozawa et al . , 135 2019 ) . Briefly , two different sizes of coverslips , 18×18 and 25×50 mm ( Matsunami , Neo No . 1 ) , 136 were soaked in piranha solution containing a 7 : 3 ( v / v ) mixture of sulfuric acid ( H 2 SO 4 ) and 30 % 137 hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) for 30 min . Both coverslip sizes were rinsed with distilled water and 138 then soaked in a 5 % TMCS - ethanol solution ( mixture of 5 % TMCS and 95 % ethanol ) overnight 139 at room temperature . The coverslips were transferred and stored in absolute ethanol in glass jars 140 Breathing of actin filaments 4 with a lid and used within two days . The coverslips were rinsed with two cycles of absolute 141 ethanol and pure water and later dried in clean air before use . 142 2 . 3 Flow chamber preparation 143 Flow chambers were prepared daily , as per the procedure as described previously ( Kron and 144 Spudich , 1986 ) . The flow chamber was prepared by mounting a small coverslip on the larger 145 coverslip placing two double - sided tapes of 0 . 15 mm thickness ( ST415 25 × 30 , 3M , Japan ) in 146 parallel , leaving a gap of ~ 5 mm . The size of the flow chamber was approximately 18 × 5 × 0 . 15 147 mm with both sides open ( ~ 10 μl volume ) . 148 2 . 4 Specimens 149 The anti - biotin antibody ( 5 μg / ml ) was loaded directly into the chamber via capillary action . The 150 unbound anti - biotin antibody was washed out with a chamber volume of the 5×polymerisation 151 buffer at one end and subsequently absorbed from the other side using a piece of coffee filter 152 paper . Polymerised actin was diluted to 5 nM with 1× polymerisation buffer , containing 10 mM 153 ascorbic acid as an oxygen scavenger , immediately before loading into the chamber . Unbound 154 actin filaments were washed out with polymerisation buffer containing 10 mM ascorbic acid . 155 FRET signals were observed immediately . To prevent fluid flow onto the top of the coverslip due 156 to the electrostatic effect caused by the hydrophobic surface of the coverslip , occasionally sub - 157 microliters of dH 2 O were dropped before the coverslip was mounted with a double - sided tape . 158 Two approaches were utilized to identify the barbed end . The first step was to elongate actin at 159 the barbed end with 30 % Dylight 650 - labelled actin . The second approach was used to identify 160 the barbed end . Gelsolin , a known actin severing / barbed - end capping protein ( 10 nM ) , was mixed 161 with 66 μM FRET actin filaments in a sample tube . Gelsolin on the barbed end was visualised by 162 decollating the goat anti - gelsolin antibody with two concentrations of anti - rat fluorescent 163 secondary antibody . 164 2 . 5 Observation 165 The chambers were mounted on an Olympus IX - 71 microscope with a 100× objective lens 166 ( Olympus , Plan Apo , Japan ) . White light from an LED lamp ( Lumencor , SOLA , United States ) 167 was passed through a filter cube f containing an excitation filter ( FF01 - 542 / 27 - 25 ) , dichroic 168 mirror ( FF560 / 659 - Di01 - 25×36 ) , and emission filter ( FF01 - 577 / 691 - 25 ) . To observe the 169 Dylight650 actin filaments , a filter cube containing HQ620 / 60X 62032 , FF650 - Di01 - 25×36 , and 170 HQ700 / 75M 57563 was used . The final power of the excitation light was attenuated using neutral 171 density filters of up to 5 mW . All filters were purchased from Semrock , United States Images 172 were recorded using an EM - CCD camera ( iXonX3 , Andor Technology , United States ) attached to 173 the side port of the microscope through a double view ( U - SIP , Olympus , Japan ) . 174 2 . 6 Image analysis 175 Images were recorded in uncompressed AVI format ( 0 . 1 - sec exposure ) . We used an algorithm in 176 MATLAB ( MathWorks , United States ) to measure the fluorescence fluctuation along each actin 177 filament . After manually setting the polygonal line along the actin filaments containing 2 μm 178 extrapolation , the Resion of Interest ( ROI ) ( Φ = 1 . 5 μm ) automatically traced the line . The sum of 179 the fluorescent intensity of the ROI was used as each data point . The ROI position was shifted 180 every 0 . 1 μm ( ~ 1 pix ) along each actin filament ( including oversampling ) to avoid missing local 181 fluorescent fluctuations . To subtract the background in each image , an identical trace was 182 performed 2 - 3 μm apart from the targeted actin filaments where no actin was present . 183 FRET efficiency was determined from the ratio of acceptor ( Dylight 650 ) / donor ( Dylight 550 ) 184 intensity . The f FRET for 30 s recording were determined from temporal changes in FRET 185 efficiency from a single and identical ROI on actin filaments taken every 0 . 1 sec . 186 Breathing of actin filaments 5 3 Results 187 3 . 1 FRET signal is measured from an actin filament 188 We measured the fluctuations in FRET signals from subunits of actin filaments . FRET actin 189 filaments were prepared by polymerising a mixture of Dylight 550 labelled actin ( 30 % ) and 190 Dylight 650 labelled actin ( 30 % ) , and unlabelled actin ( 39 % ) . The either of dyes was conjugated 191 to 374 - cysteine residue on actin . To anchor FRET actin filaments on the glass surface coated with 192 a 5 . 0 μM anti - biotin antibody , 1 % biotinylated actin was also added ( Figure 1A ) to the FRET 193 actin filament . After polymerising actin in the dark at concentrations over 66 μM in a sample tube 194 overnight at 25 °C , polymerised FRET actin was diluted to 5 nM with the observation buffer and 195 loaded into the glass chamber using spontaneous capillary flow . The anchored actin filaments did 196 not show any detectable wobbling movement during the 30 s observation period ( Figure 1B ) , 197 indicating that the FRET - actin filament was fixed on the glass surface . Fluorescence images of 198 both the donor and acceptor from the same filament were recorded simultaneously using a dual - 199 view microscope ( Figure 1A ) . During the observation , every 1 / 30 s for 30 s , the apparent length 200 of actin filaments did not change , probably because the ratio of the fluorescently labelled actin 201 was high in this assay at 60 % . Previous reports have shown that the rate of actin polymerisation 202 and depolymerisation decrease with an increasing ratio of the labelled actin ( Amann and Pollard , 203 2001 ; Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2018 ) . The analysis was simplified based on the 204 fact that depolymerisation was negligible in this observation time frame ( Figure 1B ) . Next , to 205 confirm that the fluorescence from the acceptor dye resulted from the energy transferred from the 206 donor fluorescence , we adopted two essentially different approaches . The first approach was 207 acceptor photobleaching . Excess light at 650 nm was irradiated to bleach the acceptor dyes , 208 followed by normal observation of donor illumination ( as shown in Figure 1C , blue decayed plot ) . 209 After the photobleaching of the acceptor dye , the fluorescence intensities from the donor were 210 increased ( as shown in Figure 1C , red plot ) , indicating that the donor fluorescence is no more 211 transferred to excite the acceptor because the acceptor dyes were no more active . The second 212 approach was performed to test the complementarity of the donor and acceptor fluorescence . Both 213 fluorescence intensities decreased over time ( Figure 1D ) . We corrected both signals using a single 214 exponential decay function to avoid the effects of photobleaching and subtracted 5 % of donor 215 intensities from the acceptor due to the transmission characteristics of the filter sets . The intensity 216 profile became in reverse phase after the curves were smoothed by the moving average method 217 for visual clarification ( Figure 1D inset ) , indicating that the acceptor fluorescence was excited 218 using the energy transferred from the donor . Both approaches confirmed that our microscopy 219 settings detect FRET within a single actin filament , and the calculated FRET efficiencies become 220 a parameter to indicate the mobilities of subunits in the filament . 221 Since energy transfer is generated from Dylight 550 - actin to Dylight 650 - actin in a filament , our 222 data monitored the change at the subunit - subunit level and not within an actin molecule . By 223 labelling one actin with two fluorophores , it is found that the molecular fluctuation of individual 224 actin subunits in a filament takes two states and the transition rate is 0 . 24 – 0 . 34 / s ( Kozuka et al . , 225 2006 ) . This rate is 10 - fold slower than the sampling rate in our observation , 0 . 03 ( = 1 / 30 ) s . Thus , 226 the fast FRET signal from this assay was most likely due to the conformational change caused by 227 the fluctuation of actin subunits in the filament . During the 30 s of observation , FRET efficiency 228 at the end region of the actin filament was constantly low , while it was fluctuating ( Figure 1E ) . 229 This indicates that the location of actin subunits was far each other and not stable . In contrast , 230 FRET efficiency was temporally stable and high in the interior regions of the filament ( Figure 231 1F ) , indicating that the actin subunits in the interior region are closely and stable located . 232 3 . 2 Subunit fluctuation near the terminal ends is larger than the interior region of the 233 actin filaments 234 Breathing of actin filaments 6 In previous section , FRET efficiency fluctuated temporally , which arises a hypothesis that it may 235 also differ spatially in actin filaments . Thus , we investigated the configuration between the 236 neighbouring subunits . We scanned FRET efficiency along actin filaments at every 0 . 1 μm and 237 the average and standard deviation were estimated from 30 s of observation ( Figure 2A ) . This 238 fluctuation in FRET efficiency ( f FRET ) was quantified using the standard deviation of FRET 239 efficiencies for 4 s , obtained as the subunit fluctuation at each local position of the actin filament 240 ( Figure 2B ) . Remarkably , the spatial gradient of f FRET at one end decreased dramatically towards 241 the interiors of the actin filament , while it decreased gradually at the other end . From this 242 perspective , we plotted the absolute spatial gradient of f FRET at 0 . 2 μm from each end ( Δf FRET , 243 Figures 2C and 2D ) . One hundred filaments were subjected to Δf FRET without distinguishing the 244 end and the distributions ( black histograms in Figure 2C ) . Using the global fitting method , it was 245 found that Δf FRET consists of two Gaussian distributions which have proven to be significantly 246 different ( P < 10 - 19 ) between each peak . To investigate whether these distributions originated 247 from the structural polarity of the filament , the Δf FRET values from both ends were plotted 248 separately for each actin filament . Our analysis revealed that one end of the actin filament showed 249 a larger Δf FRET ( Figure 2C , red ) than the other ( Figure 2C , blue ) . Even filaments associated with 250 phalloidin had the same properties , the two Δf FRET distributions had a statistically difference ( P < 251 10 - 4 , Figure 2D ) . 252 Furthermore , we examined whether these differences occurred from barbed or pointed ends of the 253 actin filament . To distinguish the barbed end of actin filaments , the ends were capped with 254 gelsolin which was brightly visualised as a large circle by decorating gelsolin - antibody together 255 with a fluorescently labelled secondary antibody ( Figure 2E inset ) . The end without gelsolin 256 signal , presumably the pointed end , was subjected to Δf FRET analysis , and all Δf FRET from the ten 257 independent experiments belonged to the lower distribution ( open triangle in figure 2D inset ) . To 258 verify , another approach was performed . A donor - labelled actin monomer was added after the 259 filament was formed and decorated with phalloidin . By recognising the elongated end as barbed 260 end ( arrow in figure 2F inset ) , we analysed the Δf FRET from the other end , which is likely pointed 261 end . The Δf FRET from the ends of all the 10 actin filaments belonged to the distribution with a 262 small peak ( black triangle in Figure 2D inset ) , showing that the small Δf FRET is from the pointed 263 end . These results confirmed that the fluctuations in FRET efficiency measured in this study 264 reflect structural polarity along the actin filament . 265 4 Discussion 266 We used FRET - actin filaments by mixing actin labelled with two different fluorescent dyes . 267 Changes in FRET efficiency showed that actin molecules within the filaments fluctuated over 268 time . In addition , the fluctuation property was different for each end . We first suspected that 269 Brownian motion at the end of the actin filaments might result in random defocusing causing this 270 fluctuation . However , random defocusing should cause the same positional changes at both ends . 271 Our results suggest that Δf FRET in each end has a different type of fluctuation based on amplitude 272 and decay . The Δf FRET decreased at a shorter distance from the barbed end to the interior region , 273 compared to the pointed end ( Figure 2B ) . We could not determine how long the f FRET from both 274 ends affected the interior of the filament because the change in f FRET from both ends attenuated 275 smoothly as shifted to the interior region of the filaments . Therefore , we analysed the changes in 276 f FRET in the limited length of 0 . 2 μm from each end ( i . e . ~ 70 molecules ) . This data on f FRET 277 difference ( Figures 2C and 2D ) demonstrated that the intrinsic characteristics must originate from 278 the filament polarity , and the characteristics do not disappear when actin filaments are stabilized 279 with phalloidin . 280 Our present study showed that the absolute value of FRET efficiency was high in the interior 281 region of actin filaments with lower fluctuations . This high FRET efficiency indicated that the 282 distance change between actin subunits was small . We hypothesized that the small f FRET can be 283 occurred from following three ways . First , individual actin subunits hardly change their positions . 284 This does not seem probable since our assays were performed in solution and Brownian motion 285 Breathing of actin filaments 7 cannot be ignored . The second possible cause could be the random fluctuation of individual 286 subunits and cancelling each other . Randomly changing values of individual molecules were 287 cancelled when they were added ( Kozuka et al . , 2006 ) . The third possible cause is that 288 fluctuations might cooperatively occur in dozens of actin subunits . We believe that this subunits - 289 cooperativity may also contribute to the formation of a cluster of cofilins extending towards the 290 pointed end , as described in a previous study ( Ha et al . , 2002 ; Noguchi et al . , 2015 ) . This 291 behaviour suggests that the various states of the actin subunits may be formed at the cluster level , 292 but not with individual subunits and the variation might propagate to the internal regions . When 293 phalloidin binds , cluster - cluster binding is stabilised and fluctuates less , resulting in a smaller 294 Δf FRET . 295 While this study did not provide any data regarding nucleotide state and structural polymorphism 296 as a possible scenario for the local characteristic change , all - atom simulations presented that actin 297 molecules located near the ends have higher fluctuations than the interior of the actin filaments 298 ( Zsolnay et al . , 2020 ) . Our data displayed that actin subunits near the terminal ends are constantly 299 fluctuating regardless of the addition of a new actin monomer , suggesting that fluctuations in 300 neighbouring subunits are also sustained . In the simulation by Zsolnay et al . , the dihedral angle in 301 the 40th actin molecule from the barbed end was flattened to the same extent as the interior region 302 of the filament , but our Δf FRET indicated that the effect of the barbed end extended to the inner 303 ~ 70th actin . Our data also exhibited that the small Δf FRET decreased more gradually toward the 304 interior region at the pointed ends than at the barbed ends . If the adjacent actin subunits fluctuate 305 in the similar orientation , the fluctuation can be coordinated and occurred as the size of clusters . 306 Assuming that the constant number of clusters receives feedback from ends , we think that the 307 cluster size may be larger near the pointed end than the barbed end which may propagate the 308 orientation towards the interior of actin filaments . In this study , we visualised the flexibility of 309 actin filaments using light microscopy . The fluctuation was lower near the end regions than in the 310 interior region . The quantified data showed that the fluctuation was gradually decreased at the 311 pointed end than at the barbed end . Furthermore , the fluctuation decay was more steep at the 312 barbed end than at the pointed end . Once actin filaments are formed , the new orientations , that are 313 governed by the local , spatial and temporal position of actin filaments are generated . Those 314 orientations may take roles to maintain the dynamic change of the actin cytoskeleton . 315 5 Conflict of Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest . 316 6 Author Contributions 317 The experimental design was based on HH , IF , TM , and RM .

Experimental setup and FRET efficiency on single actin filaments 417 ( A ) Schematic illustration to observe FRET actin filaments . Glass surface is coated with anti - 418 biotin antibody ( green ) . 1 % BSA was subsequently loaded to block non - specific binding to the 419 glass surface . Actin filaments were diluted to 5 nM with the observation buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl ; 420 pH 8 . 2 ) , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and oxygen scavenger ) , right before loading 421 into the glass chamber . Actin filaments were polymerized by mixing 30 % of Dylight - 550 ( red ) , 422 30 % of Dylight 650 ( blue ) , and 1 % of biotinylated actin ( yellow ) one hour before use . FRET 423 signals were split with a 561 nm filter and simultaneously captured using a dual - view system . The 424 right panels show a typical actin filament observed under a FRET microscope monitored by 425 Dylight 550 channel ( top ) and Dylight 650 channel ( bottom ) . ( B ) No wobbling and length change 426 of actin filaments were detected under this setup for 30 seconds of observation . Still , images show 427 an actin filament every six seconds with Dylight 550 ( donor ) signal . ( C ) Fluorescence intensity 428 recovery by the acceptor photo - bleach over time . Signals of the donor ( Dylight 550 , red ) and 429 acceptor ( Dylight 650 , blue ) were normalised and plotted over time . The acceptor signal was 430 forcibly photo - bleached with 650 nm of light during the time frame indicated by arrows . Donor 431 signal intensity increased after the acceptor signal was photobleached , indicating that no acceptor 432 energy was transferred to the donor . ( D ) Spontaneous photo - bleaching of the donor ( red ) and 433 acceptor ( blue ) were measured for 30 seconds and fitted with single exponential decay curves . 434 Inset indicates high throughput intensity changes of the donor and acceptor for 10 seconds . The 435 Breathing of actin filaments 10 fluorescence of the acceptor was weak and the donor signal was bright . ( E and F ) Time course 436 FRET efficiency at the end region ( E ) and the interior region of an actin filament , as the measured 437 location was circled on the illustrated actin filaments . 438 Figure 2 . Evaluation of f FRET and Δf FRET 439 ( A and B ) FRET efficiency ( A ) and fluctuations of FRET efficiency ( f FRET , ) ( B ) are plotted along 440 an actin filament at distances of 0 . 1 μm over 30 seconds of observation . ( C and D ) Δf FRET in the 441 regions of 0 . 3 μm from both ends without ( C ) and with phalloidin ( D ) . The Δf FRET from both ends 442 of actin filaments ( scrambled ) was plotted ( black , n = 100 ) . A small Δf FRET from one end of the 443 actin filament ( blue , n = 50 ) and a Δf FRET from the other end ( red , n = 50 ) were plotted . Colour 444 Gaussian curves are fitted by using the scramble distribution , the peaks of small and large 445 gaussian . Inset in D shows the magnified image of D . Open and filled triangles show the average 446 Δf FRET estimated from linear fittings in panels E and F , respectively ( average of 10 samples , each ) . 447 ( E and F ) The f FRET from the pointed end of the actin filament . The insets show actin filaments 448 that barbed ends were distinguished by gelsolin ( E ) , which contained anti - gelsolin antibodies 449 decorated with secondary fluorescent antibodies or was elongated by actin labelled with donor 450 only ( F ) . The average Δf FRET at the region of 0 . 3 μm length from the pointed end was estimated 451 from the linear fit . 452 A B 1 μm 0 Accepter : Dylight650 - actin ( 30 % ) Donor : Dylight560 - actin ( 30 % ) Biotin - actin ( 1 % ) Anti - biotin antibody Dual view Donor Accepter t = 0 sec 6 sec 12 sec 18 sec 24 sec 30 sec ex 650 nm on off Time ( sec ) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 F R E T E ff i c i e n cy ( % ) 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time ( sec ) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 F R E T E ff i c i e n cy ( % ) 0 10 20 30 40 50 FRET Figure 1 C D E F Distance from the end (  m ) 0 2 4 6 8 f F R E T ( % ) 0 10 20 30 40 50 Figure 2 B Distance from the end (  m ) 0 2 4 6 8 F R E T E ff i c i en cy ( % ) 0 10 20 30 40 50 A  f FRET  5 10 15 20 25 30 N u m be r o f edge s 0 2 4 6 8 10 P < 10 - 19 C  f FRET  5 10 15 20 25 30 N u m be r o f edge s 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 P < 10 - 4 4 8 12 0 10 20 30 D Distance from Pointed end (  m ) 0 1 2 3 4 f F R E T ( % ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 F Distance from Pointed end (  m ) 0 1 2 3 4 f F R E T ( % ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 E
