Our earlier studies revealed that peripheral neurotrauma - induced fragmentation of the myelin basic protein ( MBP ) , a major component of the myelin sheath formed by Schwann cells , initiates a pain response from light touch stimuli ( mechani - cal allodynia ) in rodents . Here , we identiﬁed the cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( CDK5 ) , as an intracellular interactor of MBP in Schwann cells . The alge - sic peptide fragment of MBP directly associated with CDK5 . When com - plexed with its p25 coactivator , CDK5 phosphorylated the conserved MBP sequence . The expressed MBP fragment colocalized with CDK5 in Sch - wann cell protrusions . Roscovitine , an ATP - competitive CDK5 inhibitor , disrupted localization of the expressed MBP peptide . Mutations in the evo - lutionary conserved MBP algesic sequence resulted in the interference with intracellular trafﬁcking of the MBP fragment and kinase activity of CDK5 and diminished pain - like behavior in rodents . Our ﬁndings show that MBP fragment amino acid sequence conservation determines its interactions , trafﬁcking , and pronociceptive activity . Because CDK5 activity controls both neurogenesis and nociception , the algesic MBP fragment may be involved in the regulation of the CDK5 functionality in pain signaling and postinjury neurogenesis in vertebrates . Database The novel RNA - seq datasets were deposited in the GEO database under the accession number GSE107020 . Introduction Mechanosensitive axons of the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) are insulated by the myelin sheath , a multilamellar membrane that permits propagation of action potential from mechanical stimulation [ 1 ] . Schwann cells form the myelin sheath by enwrapping their cell membranes around mechanosensitive affer - ent axons [ 2 ] . Demyelination in PNS injury is thought to contribute to severe neuropathic pain states , including pain from light touch , or mechanical allodynia [ 1 , 3 ] . Myelin basic protein ( MBP ) , a major component of the myelin sheath , is an intrinsically unstructured cationic protein that interacts with anionic lipids and cytoskeletal pro - teins . These interactions regulate myelin compaction and structural assembly of the axon – glia unit [ 4 ] . The invariant a - helix motif 87 - VVHFF - 91 domain of MBP , conserved across species , is essential to T cell receptor recognition [ 5 ] . Abbreviations CDK5 , cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ; MBP , myelin basic protein ; PNS , peripheral nervous system . 3485 The FEBS Journal 285 ( 2018 ) 3485 – 3502 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies We previously reported that physical injury in the PNS microenvironment stimulates the protease - mediated cleavage of MBP and the release of frag - ments comprising the invariant a - helix motif . These fragments accumulate at the paranodal / nodal regions of the damaged myelinated ﬁbers . A single injection of synthetic peptides comprising this MBP sequence into an intact nerve is sufﬁcient to produce robust mechani - cal allodynia sustained for weeks in rodents [ 3 , 6 – 8 ] . However , the molecular identity of cellular proteins that interact with the algesic MBP peptides was unknown . Here , we investigated the cellular interac - tions and the role of the amino acid sequence conser - vation in its relationship with the cell components that are involved in the peptide trafﬁcking mechanisms in Schwann cells . The present study provides the experimental evidence that the algesic MBP peptides directly bind CDK5 . CDK5 is an intracellular serine / threonine kinase and a global orchestrator of neuronal cytoskeletal dynamics , including sensory PNS neurons [ 9 ] . CDK5 deregulation contributes to neurodegeneration [ 10 – 15 ] and pain sig - naling [ 16 , 17 ] . CDK5 phosphorylates a diverse list of substrates , including TRPV1 and NMDA receptors , implicating its activity in a broad range of cellular pro - cesses during pain states [ 16 – 18 ] . CDK5 is bound to the cell membrane via its interactions with the p39 and p35 noncyclin activator proteins [ 19 , 20 ] . Cleavage of the p39 and p35 by calpain results in the N - end truncated p29 and p25 activators . As a result , the stable CDK5 complex with either p29 or p25 and with the elevated activity is trafﬁcked from the membrane to the cyto - plasm and the nucleus . Our ﬁndings established that the reciprocal interaction between CDK5 and the algesic MBP peptides represents a novel molecular mechanism of intracellular MBP trafﬁcking and depends on the MBP sequence conservation . The sequence conserva - tion of the algesic MBP peptide is essential in the devel - opment of neuropathic pain . Results Synthetic MBP epitope internalizes and localizes to cell projections in cultured Schwann cells The algesic MBP84 - 104 cryptic epitope is released in the nerve postinjury as a result of proteolysis of MBP . In our earlier studies , the injection of the main algesic , autoimmune MBP84 - 104 epitope that is hidden in the native MBP fold , into an intact nerve was sufﬁcient to induce robust , long - lasting allodynia in rodents [ 3 , 6 – 8 ] . Peptides representing MBP epitope region MBP80 - 99 and MBP84 - 104 exhibit a high level of amino acid conservation among evolutionary distant animal spe - cies ( Fig . 1A , Table 1 ) . Notably , the highly conserved motif 87 - VVHFF - 91 representing an alpha - helix [ 21 ] was present in both peptide species . The MBP epitope region is encoded by exons 3 – 4 of all four classic MBP splicing variant , and exons 6 – 7 of variant 1 of the Golli MBP in humans ( Fig . 1B ) . We initially screened whether the synthetic MBP peptides can speciﬁcally bind receptors on the surface of Schwann cells , the dominant cell type and thus , the likely source for MBP interactors in MBP - injected nerves [ 8 ] . The synthetic ﬂuorescently labeled MBP peptide MBP80 - 99 was administered extracellularly to the primary rat Schwann cell cultures . After 30 min incubation , cells were ﬁxed and ﬂuorescent signals were recorded using in situ epiﬂuorescent microscopy . Using a FITC - labeled MBP80 - 99 - FITC peptide , we detected its speciﬁc association with the cell periphery , including in cell projections / lamellipodia ( Fig . 2A ) . This speciﬁc association was not observed with the scramble MBP80 - 99 - SCR - FITC - labeled peptide . The competitive titration of MBP80 - 99 - FITC using a fourfold excess of unlabeled MBP80 - 99 peptide reduced the signal intensity thus supporting the speciﬁc nature of cell projection binding of MBP80 - 99 - FITC ( Fig . 2B ) . The signal speciﬁcity was further conﬁrmed by coincubation of FITC - and Tetramethylrhodamine ( TMR ) labeled MBP80 - 99 peptides . The FITC - and TMR - speciﬁc signals juxtaposed at cell periphery loci ( Fig . 2C ) . Trafﬁcking of the algesic MBP peptide to Schwann cell lamellipodia relies on MBP amino acid sequence conservation To identify the potential cellular interactors of the internalized algesic MBP peptide , we designed a spe - cialized expression construct that encoded the three head - to - tail - linked MBP68 - 102 sequences C - terminally tagged with mCherry ( MBP - WT - mCherry , Fig . 2D , Table 2 ) . Based on the well - established knowledge by others , we used the MBP - tripeptide - mCherry con - structs , rather than a monopeptide construct , to achieve a better protein stability and to signal readout , as well as to directly monitor the tagged construct in the cell milieu . We have also designed the mutant con - struct that deviated from the highly conserved in verte - brates central alpha - helix 84 – 95 portion of MBP ( residues are numbered according to human MBP , GenBank NP _ 001020261 ) . In the mutant construct , amphoteric Gly - 89 substituted for the basic His - 89 ( MBP - H89G - mCherry ) . Both constructs were expressed in rat Schwann cells and the subcellular 3486 The FEBS Journal 285 ( 2018 ) 3485 – 3502 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Algesic MBP fragment targets CDK5 A . V . Chernov et al . localization of the constructs was then recorded . The MBP - WT - mCherry construct was consistently traf - ﬁcked to the Schwann cell lamellipodial protrusions involved in myelination ( Fig . 2D ) . In contrast , the lamellipodia - speciﬁc signals could not be observed in cells expressing the H89G mutant . We concluded that the cell protrusion - directed trafﬁcking of the algesic MBP fragment occurs via amino acid sequence - speciﬁc binding to a cellular interactor molecule ( s ) . Expression of MBP peptide activates pain - related signaling pathways To determine which signaling pathways became altered in response to the MBP - WT - mCherry expression in Schwann cells the genome - wide transcriptome analysis was conducted . Naive Schwann cells were used as a control . RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) was performed using NextSeq 500 DNA sequencer ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) , RNA - seq read data were mapped to the Rattus norvegicus genome ( version Rn5 ) and normalized using CUFFLINKS software ( http : / / cole - tra pnell - lab . github . io / cufflinks / ) . To predict the effect of MBP - WT - mCherry on the regulation of canonical sig - naling pathways the gene expression data ( log 2 ( FPKM ) ≥ 0 . 01 ) were analyzed using IPA ( Qia - gen , Valencia , CA , USA ) ( Fig . 3 ) . We compared the activated canonical pathways in Schwann cells to our previously published gene expression data [ 7 , 8 ] . The latter were obtained after the intrasciatic injection of the MBP84 - 104 - WT peptide in female rats ( n = 6 ) .

Algesic MBP fragment targets CDK5 7 days after the intrasciatic peptide injection the speci - mens of sciatic nerves , dorsal root ganglia , and dorsal spinal cord were collected and the coding RNAs were analyzed by the genome - wide transcriptional proﬁling using microarray ( GEO dataset GSE34868 ) . Our comparative system biology analysis ( Fig . 3 ) indicated that at least 38 signaling pathways activated in both Schwann cells expressing MBP84 - 104 - WT - mCherry and rat nerves injected with the peptide . These pathways included VEGF signaling , neuroin - ﬂammation signaling , paxillin signaling , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , and IL - 2 signaling , p38 / MAPK , CDK5 signaling , purinergic receptor signaling , and others . These data suggest that Schwann cells expressing MBP - WT - mCherry exhibit the characteristics that are compara - ble to our MBP - mediated pain models in rodents .

Chernov et al . respective transfected Schwann cells . Intact Schwann cells were used as a control . To determine the identity of the copulled - down proteins , the precipitated mate - rial was subjected to the LC - MS analysis using a linear trap quadrupole mass - spectrometer ( LTQ - MS ) . Seven - teen unique proteins were present in the pulled - down MBP - WT - mCherry samples relative to the control ( Table 3 ) , including CDK5 , actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex subunit 1A ( ARPC1A ) [ 22 ] , plakoglobin ( JUP ) [ 23 ] , and testin ( TES ) that are known to be associated with cell junctions , focal adhesions , and cell protrusions – lamellipodia . We evaluated the copulled - down samples by immunoblotting using the CDK5 , ARPC1A , JUP , and TES antibodies . The samples were positive for the presence of CDK5 ( Fig . 4A ) , while other four proteins were undetectable ( data not shown ) . Next , we pulled - down the MBP - H89G - mCherry construct and com - pared side - by - side the level of CDK5 in the WT and H89G - precipitated samples . Our results indicated that the H89G mutant exhibited the reduced ability to bind to CDK5 ( Fig . 4A ) . CDK5 and MBP colocalize in Schwann cells We coexpressed MBP - WT - mCherry and the human CDK5 fused to a ZsGreen1 tag ( CDK5 - ZsGreen1 ) in cultured Schwann cells . A signiﬁcant level of colocal - ization of both constructs was detected in cell projec - tions ( Fig . 4B , C , Movie S1 ) . In addition , we observed a signiﬁcant localization of MBP - WT - mCherry to cell nuclei . The expressed MBP - WT - mCherry alone did not result in accumulation of ﬂuorescent signals in cell nuclei . Because CDK5 protein is known to localize in both cell periphery and nuclear / perinuclear regions [ 24 , 25 ] we proposed that the exogenously overex - pressed CDK5 is responsible for nuclear trafﬁcking of MBP - WT - mCherry . We incubated Schwann cells expressing CDK5 - ZsGreen1 with extracellularly administered TMR - labeled MBP80 - 99 peptide . Using confocal imaging we observed colocalization of CDK5 and MBP80 - 99 - TMR - speciﬁc signals in both cell Table 2 .

V . Chernov et al . Algesic MBP fragment targets CDK5 protrusions and cell nuclei ( Fig . 4D ) consistent with the coexpression data ( Fig . 4B , C ) . We concluded that the extracellular MBP peptide can be internalized by Schwann cells and CDK5 binds both extracellularly administered and the expressed MBP peptide species . CDK5 phosphorylates the algesic MBP peptides The algesic MBP sequence comprises multiple poten - tial phosphorylation sites sharing a consensus motif Thr / Ser - Pro [ 26 , 27 ] . The kinase substrate prediction suggested that Thr - 96 and Thr - 99 can be targeted by multiple Thr / Ser - speciﬁc protein kinases , including mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinases and CDKs ( Fig . 5A ) [ 26 ] . CDK5 was predicted to phosphorylate the Thr - 96 , Thr - 99 , and Ser - 166 ( Fig . 5B ) . Using LTQ - MS of proteins in the MBP - WT - mCherry pull - down sample , we detected the NIVpTPRTPPPA - HYGSLPQK fragment with phosphorylated Thr - 96 ( data not shown ) . Based on these data , we hypothe - sized that CDK5 binds to the MBP peptides and then phosphorylates either Thr - 96 or Thr - 99 , or both . To test if the cryptic algesic peptides are CDK5 sub - strates , the MBP84 - 104 - WT , MBP84 - 104 - H89G , and MBP84 - 104 - SCR synthetic peptides were coincubated with the puriﬁed CDK5 / p25 and the level of phospho - rylation was then measured by the incorporation of c - 33 P . We also used the MBP84 - 104 - WT peptides with synthetic phospho - threonine ( pT ) at either 96 or 99 positions to determine which individual Thr residue is phosphorylated . The MBP84 - 104 - WT peptide but not the scrambled peptide was efﬁciently phosphorylated by CDK5 / p25 ( Fig . 5C ) . The H89G mutation reduced the level of the peptide phosphorylation at least two - fold suggesting that the amino acid conservation of the invariant motif 87 - VVHFF - 91 is important for the CDK5 interactions with the algesic MBP . The level of CDK5 - dependent phosphorylation of the MBP84 - 104 - WT peptides with either pT96 or pT99 , was reduced more than twofold relative to the unmodiﬁed peptide . These data implied that both Thr - 96 and Thr - 99 in the algesic peptide were phosphorylated by CDK5 with a roughly similar efﬁcacy . Roscovitine disrupts the MBP peptide – CDK5 interactions Roscovitine is a broad - range purine inhibitor of CDKs , including CDK5 , through its direct competi - tion at their ATP - binding site [ 28 , 29 ] . Based on our modeling data , we hypothesized that roscovitine would interfere with the CDK5 – MBP peptide inter - actions . To test this model , we coincubated roscov - itine for 2 h with Schwann cells coexpressing the MBP - WT - mCherry and CDK5 - ZsGreen1 constructs . In the absence of roscovitine , the CDK5 and the MBP peptide immunoreactivity overlapped , especially in the nucleus and cell protrusions ( Fig . 6A ) . In the presence of roscovitine , the MBP peptide immunore - activity was detected in the cell protrusions , but not in the nucleus . In turn , cell protrusions became free Table 3 .

V . Chernov et al . of CDK5 ﬂuorescence which persisted in the nucleus . These ﬁndings implied that roscovitine effectively blocked the MBP peptide – CDK5 complex and liber - ated MBP peptide - free CDK5 from Schwann cell protrusions , yet had no effect on CDK5 transloca - tion to the nucleus . ATP hydrolysis by CDK5 is affected by His - 89 Similar to others [ 30 ] , we measured ATP to ADP con - version catalyzed by CDK5 / p25 in the presence of MBP84 - 104 - WT , MBP84 - 104 - H89G , MBP84 - 104 - SCR , and MBP84 - 104 - WT with either synthetic pT96 or pT99 . Except MBP84 - 104 - H89G , the effect of the pep - tides on CDK5 activity was insigniﬁcant . In contrast , the mutant peptide considerably reduced the ATP to ADP conversion suggesting the vital importance of the conserved 87 - VVHFF - 91 motif in the physiological reg - ulation of the CDK5 function ( Fig . 6B ) . We hypothesized that the conserved 87 - VVHFF - 91 motif of the CDK5 - bound algesic MBP84 - 104 wild - type peptide is positioned near the ATP - binding site . Mutations in its conserved sequence led to the interfer - ence with the ATP to ADP conversion . To model the CDK5 complex with the ENPVVHFFKNIV pTPRTPPPSQ peptide , we used the structures of CDK5 / p25 ( PDB : 3o0g ) [ 31 ] and the MBP fragment bound to HLA - DR2 ( PDB : 1vf1 ) [ 32 ] . The fold of the pT96 region in the CDK5 active site was modeled based of the positions of the substrate peptides in the active site of CDK2 [ 33 , 34 ] . The CDK2 structure was aligned with CDK5 ( PDB : 3o0g ) and then the posi - tions of the main chain of the MBP peptide were aligned with the CDK2 substrate peptides . This approach allowed us to deﬁne the relative positions of the P3 and P4 residues ( K and N in the MBP peptide , respectively ) and roughly assess the general fold of the peptide bound to the CDK5 globule ( Fig . 6C ) . Accordingly , the peptide chain including P7 His - 89 is localized near the negatively charged ATP - binding site of CDK5 . Alterations of the MBP peptide sequence may alter the peptide fold that potentially interferes with ATP binding in the CDK5 ATP - binding pocket and consequently inhibit the ATP to ADP conversion .

Algesic MBP fragment targets CDK5 His - 89 alters the algesic potency of the MBP peptide To determine if the His - 89 mutation affected not only the trafﬁcking pathway of the MBP84 - 104 peptide but also its algesic potency , the three synthetic peptides – the wild - type ( MBP84 - 104 - WT ) , the H89G mutant ( MBP84 - 104 - H89G ) , the scrambled peptide ( MBP84 - 104 - SCR ) , and T96A / T99A dual mutant ( MBP84 - 104 - T96A / T99A ) – were each administered by intrafascicu - lar injection into sciatic nerve in rats ( Fig . 7A ) . The animals were then subjected to von Frey testing for 7 days . The withdrawal thresholds in von Frey tests in the ipsilateral paw of rats that received the MBP84 - 104 - WT peptide dropped within day 1 postinjection , indicative of the robust mechanical allodynia ( Fig . 7B ) . Withdrawal thresholds remained low in ani - mals injected with MBP84 - 104 - WT peptide for the entire 7 - day test period , especially when compared with the scrambled peptide that was inactive in our von Frey tests ( P ≤ 0 . 05 ) . Notably , the pain - inducing efﬁcacy of a MBP84 - 104 - T96A - T99A dual mutant peptide was reduced on days 2 – 7 as compared to the wild - type peptides . A single H89G mutation was sufﬁ - cient to signiﬁcantly reduce the pain - inducing efﬁcacy of the peptide .

Chernov et al . Algesic MBP fragment targets CDK5 Furthermore , the MBP68 - 102 peptide translocates toward the paranode / node of Ranvier ( NoR ) of the Sch - wann cell – axon unit , as shown in ﬁbers teased out from the nerve at day 1 postaxotomy ( Fig . 8A ) , in agreement with our previous report [ 6 ] . Our comparative transcrip - tional proﬁling determined elevated expression of the CDK family genes , including CDK5 , in nerve microen - vironment at day 1 postaxotomy ( Fig . 8B and GEO dataset GSE34868 ) corroborating the earlier reports of CDK5 expression in the PNS [ 9 , 37 ] . Myelinating Sch - wann cells of characteristic crescent morphology pro - duce both the MBP68 - 102 peptide and CDK5 in nerve at day 1 postaxotomy ( Fig . 8C ) . Based on our in vitro and in vivo data , we propose a model of CDK5 - depen - dent translocation of the algesic MBP to the Schwann cell lamelopodia toward the paranodes and nodes of Ranvier ( Fig . 8D ) , the sites of pain - related ion channel clustering [ 38 ] . Together , our data for the ﬁrst time demonstrate the direct interactions between CDK5 and the highly con - served , pronociceptive and autoantigenic MBP84 - 104 sequence . Our results suggest that the algesic function of the degraded MBP peptide species in PNS is CDK5 - dependent . The reciprocal nature of this rela - tionship is evidenced from the ability of the kinase to phosphorylate MBP84 - 104 , as the amino acid sequence conservation is required to sustain ATP hydrolysis reg - ulated by CDK5 . Discussion Normally , pain serves as an alarm of impending dan - ger . But an injury in the PNS leading to a damage of the myelin sheath may contribute to a chronic state of neuropathic pain termed mechanical allodynia [ 1 , 3 ] . MBP is a component of the myelin sheath synthesized by Schwann cells . After nerve injury , the upregulated protease activity cleaves MBP [ 3 , 6 , 8 ] . While the released proteolytic fragments activate the pronocicep - tive machinery , the underlying molecular mechanisms remained elusive . We previously reported that intrasci - atic injections of the synthetic peptides corresponding to the 68 – 102 sequence of MBP that is hidden in the native intact MBP fold reproduce long - lasting mechan - ical allodynia [ 3 , 6 – 8 ] . This MBP region folds into amphipathic a - helix and exhibits remarkable conserva - tion in vertebrates ( Fig . 1A ) . The corresponding MBP fragments are known primary immunodominant epi - topes in multiple sclerosis [ 39 ] . The 89 - HFFK - 92 pocket is essential to T cell receptor recognition [ 5 ] .

Chernov et al . peptides prior to T cell recruitment to the nerve and the development of the MBP - induced pain is only par - tially depended on T cells as shown using T cell - deﬁ - cient nude rats [ 8 ] . Phosphorylation of full - length MBP by CDK5 and other protein kinases has been reported previously [ 40 – 42 ] . Threonine residues Thr - 96 and Thr - 99 can be phosphorylated by kinases includ - ing ERK1 and ERK2 [ 43 ] . Furthermore , other resi - dues , such as His - 89 and Lys - 92 , also may undergo phosphorylation to yield difﬁcult to detect acid - labile phosphoramidates [ 44 – 46 ] . Here , we report that the wild - type peptides derived from the algesic MBP sequence directly interact with CDK5 in Schwann cells . CDK5 is a unique CDK family enzyme known to orchestrate cytoskeletal dynamics in the nervous system and a well - estab - lished component in pain signaling processes [ 16 , 17 , 47 ] . CDK5 phosphorylates and regulates the activity of a number of major substrates central to nociception , including N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) [ 48 ] , P / Q - type voltage - dependent calcium channel ( VDCC ) [ 49 ] , transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor - 1 ( TRPV1 ) [ 50 ] , potassium voltage - gated channel Kv2 . 1 [ 51 ] , and ATP - gated ion channels [ 52 , 53 ] .

V . Chernov et al . Algesic MBP fragment targets CDK5 including Alzheimer’s disease , brain injuries , Parkin - son’s disease , and ALS [ 11 – 15 ] . We demonstrated that CDK5 bound to the algesic MBP sequence and then phosphorylated both Thr residues . The MBP binding to CDK5 greatly affected both its cell com - partmentalization and enzymatic activity . However , whether this molecular event affects the functions of MBP or CDK5 in pain versus in normal develop - ment warrants future investigation . The selective trafﬁcking to the Schwann cell protru - sions and algesic activity were repressed in the mutant MBP peptides , highlighting the importance of the amino acid sequence conservation of the MBP hidden epitope . Schwann cells release signals that guide the assembly of multiprotein cell adhesion , ion channels , and scaffolding complexes into the distinct longitudi - nal myelin domains [ 38 ] . MBP has a well - established role in myelin compaction by regulation of the multi - protein and lipid cell adhesions of the opposing Sch - wann cell membranes [ 4 ] . Our experimental results also support and extend the earlier observations by others [ 54 ] who identiﬁed the phosphorylation - depen - dent active nuclear trafﬁcking of MBP . Inherently , myelinating Schwann cells are the source of myelin proteins in the PNS , including MBP [ 2 ] . Physical disruption of the Schwann cell – axon unit and its plasma and myelin membranes caused by nerve injury releases myelin peptides . The algesic MBP84 - 104 peptide is primarily localized in Schwann cells in vivo [ 6 , 8 ] consistent with its efﬁcient internalization in cul - tured Schwann cells . The endogenous MBP peptide does not colocalize with macrophages in the postinjury nerve [ 6 ] implying that the peptide escapes the macro - phage - mediated phagocytosis . Inhibition of matrix met - alloproteinases both blocks the MBP epitope release and diminishes pain caused by nerve injury [ 3 , 6 , 8 ] . The myelin lamellae terminate at the Schwann cell cytoplasm - ﬁlled paranodal loops in a close proximity to action potential propagation , ionic ﬂuxes , and extensive phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of the molecular machinery at the paranode and NoR , the sites of pain - related ion channel clustering [ 2 , 38 ] . The algesic MBP fragments are selectively internalized by mechanosensory A - ﬁbers ( inherently myelinated ) and not nociceptive C - ﬁbers ( inherently unmyelinated ) , producing pain from mechanical but not thermal stim - ulation [ 6 – 8 ] . Both MMPs and the algesic MBP pep - tides translocate toward the paranode / NoR regions in response to nerve injury [ 8 , 55 ] . The algesic MBP pep - tides accumulation in the Schwann cell protrusions in vitro and the paranodal / nodal regions following nerve trauma is likely to be central to their algesic action [ 8 , 56 ] . In the nodal / paranodal area , the site of the CDK5 - MBP binding , the energy demand is high . To support extensive ionic ﬂuxes and action potential propagation , the energy is commonly released in the form of ATP . Our data indicate that CDK5 promotes hydrolysis of ATP more efﬁciently using the H89G mutant peptide as substrate compared to the wild - type peptide . Our modeling suggests that the H89G mutant fold may interfere with the ATP binding . In turn , the original peptide does not interfere with the ATP binding and , as a result , is efﬁciently phosphorylated . These data imply that conservation of this sequence region of MBP is important . Conversely , if this conservation is abolished , the mutant MBP sequence may interfere with the ATP binding to CDK5 and CDK5 function in general . Our data suggest that the binding mode of the algesic MBP fragments involves regions proximal to the ATP - binding site of CDK5 . Given the two - substrate kinetics , it is plausible that the algesic MBP peptide binding to CDK5 would affect the efﬁciency of ATP conversion to ADP . ATP alters nociceptive sensitivity via the ATP - gated P2X receptor cation channels localized at the site of nerve injury [ 57 ] . Our results also imply that muta - tions that potentially destroy the invariant helical struc - ture of the 68 – 102 MBP region may lead to the fold that affects both the kinase activity of CDK5 and the algesic ability of MBP . Conservation of this MBP region in vertebrates may protect the vital CDK5 func - tionality in neurogenesis or nociception . In sum , our study identiﬁed CDK5 as an intracellular target of the speciﬁc immunodominant , algesic fragments of MBP . Whether or not this interaction contributes to pain facilitation warrants investigation , but it clearly controls cellular trafﬁcking of the algesic MBP fragments . Sequence conservation of the algesic 68 – 102 MBP pep - tides in vertebrates deﬁnes the molecular mechanism in its functional regulation of neuropathic pain .
