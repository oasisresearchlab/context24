The cholera toxin is the main suspect to cause this relationship . We report the high - resolution crystal structures ( 1 . 1 – 1 . 6 Å ) of the native cholera toxin B - pentamer for both classical and El Tor biotypes , in complexes with relevant blood group determinants and a fragment of its primary receptor , the GM1 ganglio - side . The blood group A determinant binds in the opposite orientation compared to previ - ously published structures of the cholera toxin , whereas the blood group H determinant , characteristic of blood group O , binds in both orientations . H - determinants bind with higher affinity than A - determinants , as shown by surface plasmon resonance . Together , these findings suggest why blood group O is a risk factor for severe cholera . Author Summary Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease that kills a hundred thousand people per year . With climate change , the number of cases is predicted to increase to millions . Individuals with blood group O are particularly at risk . Here we report high - resolution crystal structures of the native cholera toxin of both major biotypes , in complexes with relevant blood group determinants . These structures , in combination with quantitative binding data , shed light on cholera blood group dependence . Understanding the molecular basis of this association is expected to be of considerable importance , for example for developing new vaccination strategies that take this information into account .

Well remembered is the recent outbreak in Haiti following the earthquake in 2010 – the worst in recent history . Every year , several million people fall ill from cholera and one hundred thousand die [ 2 ] . Individuals with blood group O have a particularly high risk of severe symp - toms and hospitalization [ 3 – 8 ] , but the molecular causes of this association are not well under - stood . However , individuals with blood group O are not more susceptible to cholera infection than those with other blood groups , pointing towards the critical role of cholera virulence fac - tors , rather than bacterial colonization [ 3 , 4 ] . V . cholerae is a gram - negative bacterium capable of colonizing the human small intestine . In response to environmental stimuli , the bacterium produces and secretes its main virulence factor , the cholera toxin ( CT ) [ 9 ] . CT is an AB 5 protein toxin , which consists of one toxic A - subunit ( CTA ) and five identical B - subunits arranged in a doughnut - shaped ring ( CTB ) [ 10 ] . The B - pentamer itself is non - toxic and , in fact , part of a well - known vaccine ( Dukoral ) . It is responsible for binding to the host cell receptors as a first step of pathogenesis . The primary receptor of the cholera toxin is the GM1 ganglioside , which is expressed in distinct membrane microdomains of small - intestinal epithelial cells [ 11 , 12 ] . CTB can bind five GM1 gangliosides simultaneously , resulting in one of the strongest carbohydrate - protein interactions known [ 13 ] . After receptor binding , the toxin is internalized by endocytosis , where it hijacks the cells ’ endogenous pathways , ultimately inducing the watery diarrhea that is characteristic of cholera [ 14 ] . There are two major biotypes of V . cholerae , classical and El Tor , which produce cholera toxins with a slight sequence variation ( cCT and ET CT ) [ 15 , 16 ] . cCT and ET CT differ in only two residues of the B - subunit , His18 / Tyr18 and Thr47 / Ile47 ( classical / El Tor ) . El Tor V . cholerae is reported to have the strongest blood group association [ 17 ] . This biotype has been dominating the current pandemic , which has been ongoing since 1961 . However , since 2001 a new hybrid biotype has taken over , which has the biochemical characteristics of El Tor V . cho - lerae , but produces a cholera toxin with the classical sequence [ 18 ] . ABO ( H ) histo - blood group antigens are carbohydrates expressed on the surface of red blood cells and epithelial cells , as glycolipids or glycoproteins . The smallest determinant is the H determinant , a trisaccharide characteristic of blood group O . It can be converted into the A - and B - determinants by enzymatic addition of N - acetylgalactosamine ( GalNAc ) or galactose ( Gal ) , respectively ( see Fig 1 for carbohydrate structures and nomenclature ) . Blood group anti - gens are also expressed in bodily secretions such as mucus or as free lactose - derived oligosac - charides in human milk ( referred to as ‘ human milk oligosaccharides ’ or HMOs , to distinguish these from ‘ blood group antigens ’ or BGAs ) [ 19 – 21 ] . Despite the identification of the cholera toxin as the likely culprit of cholera blood group dependence [ 7 ] , the literature has been inconclusive regarding the toxin ’ s capacity to bind blood group antigens . While the cholera toxin was reported to bind A - and B - active glycolipids and glycoproteins on intestinal brush border membranes [ 22 , 23 ] , microtiter well assays sug - gested that only a chimera of CTB and the homologous heat - labile enterotoxin from entero - toxigenic E . coli ( LTB ) , but not CTB itself , could bind blood group antigens [ 24 ] . Two crystal structures of LTB and the CTB / LTB chimera in complex with HMOs identified a possible blood group antigen binding site on the lateral side of the toxins , distinct from its primary binding site ( for GM1 ) [ 25 , 26 ] . Recent studies , by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) , isother - mal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) and saturation transfer difference NMR ( STD NMR ) , con - firmed that HMOs or other blood group antigen derivatives can indeed bind to CTB , however , none of these studies used unmodified blood group determinants [ 27 – 29 ] . Furthermore , they came to different conclusions : While HMOs were found to bind to CTB of both biotypes , but with different kinetics [ 27 ] , a custom - synthesized β - glycoside of the B Lewis - y oligosaccharide Molecular Basis of Cholera Blood Group Dependence PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 April 15 , 2016 2 / 19 Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . only bound to cCTB , but not to ET CTB [ 28 ] . The binding to ET CTB was restored by mutat - ing Ile47 to Thr47 , suggesting a prominent role of this residue in blood group antigen recognition . The current study was designed to elucidate the molecular causes of cholera blood group dependence . Here , we present high - resolution X - ray crystal structures of both variants of CTB , in complexes with the unmodified blood group determinants of blood groups A and O , with matching SPR data . Results Crystal structures Blood group determinants bind to the lateral side of the cholera toxin . Altogether , five X - ray crystal structures were determined in this study , revealing for the first time the atomic details of blood group antigens bound to the cholera toxin ( Fig 2 ) . Four of the structures con - tain the blood group determinants A - penta - BGA and H - tetra - BGA ( bound to cCTB and ET CTB , respectively ) , while the fifth structure is in complex with the human milk oligosaccharide A - penta - HMO ( bound to ET CTB ) . The structures were solved to 1 . 1 – 1 . 6 Å resolution and refined to R free values of 15 . 6 – 26 . 0 % ( Table 1 ) . These are the first published cholera toxin struc - tures of the El Tor biotype . Moreover , no previous toxin structure has been reported in com - plex with the blood group H determinant , which is characteristic of blood group O . All structures exhibit the characteristic fold of the cholera toxin B - pentamer [ 10 , 30 ] ( Fig 2A ) . The crystals grown in Tris - bicine buffer ( the ET CTB complexes and cCTB + H - tetra - BGA ) contained two B - pentamers in the asymmetric unit ( arranged “ top - to - top ” ; S1 Fig ) , while the cCTB + A - penta - BGA crystals , grown in MES - imidazole buffer , contained only a sin - gle B - pentamer . In all five structures , the blood group oligosaccharides were found to bind to Fig 1 . Structures and nomenclatures of the oligosaccharides in this article .

In addition to the ligands at the secondary binding site , the two structures of cCTB contain Gal monosaccharides in the primary binding site ( Fig 2A ) , which shows that the toxin can bind ligands at both binding sites simultaneously . Galactose is presumably a remnant from the purification by D - Gal affinity chromatography . A - penta - BGA binds to CTB in an unexpected orientation . Crystal structures of the cCTB and ET CTB complexes with A - penta - BGA were determined to a resolution of 1 . 4 Å and 1 . 6 Å , respectively . The crystals were obtained from different crystallization conditions and were non - isomorphous , but belonged to the same crystallographic space group ( P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , Table 1 ) . In both structures , A - penta - BGA is bound with the blood - group - A - specific GalNAc residue facing amino acid 18 , and with its reducing end ( N - acetylglucosamine ; GlcNAc ) towards residue 47 ( Fig 2B and 2C ) . This is in stark contrast to the previously published struc - tures of LTB and the CTB / LTB chimera , where A - penta - HMO is bound in the opposite orien - tation , with the reducing - end glucose ( Glc ) facing towards Tyr18 [ 25 , 26 ] ( referred to here as orientation 1 ; S2 Fig ) . The only sequence differences in the binding sites of the CTB / LTB chi - mera and the ET CTB structures concern residues 47 and 94 , represented by Thr and Asn in the chimera , and by Ile and His in ET CTB , respectively . In the ET CTB structure , only three of the ten binding sites exhibited sufficient electron density to allow modeling of the entire ligand . Even in those cases , the B - factors of the terminal carbohydrate residues GalNAc and Fuc α 2 were disproportionally high compared to those in the other structures , suggesting that they are less tightly bound ( Fig 2E ; in cCTB , the electron density of the GalNAc residue is slightly better defined ) . Moreover , Fuc α 2 displays only water - mediated and internal carbohydrate - carbohy - drate interactions , whereas the trisaccharide core ( Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] GlcNAc ) consistently shows strong H - bonding interactions with CTB ( Fig 2B and 2C , S1 Table ) . Fuc α 3 is particularly tightly anchored to the toxin in both structures , through hydrogen bonds with the backbones of residues 47 and 94 as well as the side chain of Gln3 from the neighboring B - subunit . The reducing - end GlcNAc binds to the backbone of Gly45 . The main differences between the cCTB and ET CTB structures concern the internal Gal residue , which interacts with Tyr18 and His94 in the ET CTB structure , while in cCTB , it is too far away from the shorter His18 side chain to form a hydrogen bond ( Fig 2B and 2C ) . It is noteworthy that in the ET CTB structure exclu - sively , Gln16 often has a different conformation and points away from the ligand - binding site , thereby weakening the H - bonding network to the ligand . A - penta - HMO binds to CTB in the same orientation as A - penta - BGA . To compare the results from the CTB structure in complex with A - penta - BGA with those obtained with the related human milk oligosaccharide used in previous investigations [ 25 – 27 , 29 ] , A - penta - HMO was co - crystallized with ET CTB , and the structure was refined to a resolution of 1 . 6 Å . The ligand binds in the same orientation as A - penta - BGA in the other CTB structures ( here referred to as orientation 2 ) . The complete ligand could be reliably modeled in seven of ten binding sites , with the terminal GalNAc and Fuc α 2 residues being far more ordered than in A - penta - BGA ( Fig 2D and 2E ) . In both structures , Gln16 points away from the ligand in the highly occupied sites . Otherwise , Gln16 adopts the original conformation . H - tetra - BGA binds to CTB in two orientations . To our knowledge , this is the first struc - ture of an AB 5 toxin ( and in fact of any protein toxin ) in complex with the blood group H determinant . The crystal structures of the cCTB and ET CTB complexes were determined to a resolution of 1 . 1 Å and 1 . 5 Å , respectively . Both proteins crystallized using the same conditions , but in different space groups ( P 2 1 2 1 2 1 and P 2 1 ; Table 1 ) . Well - defined electron density is pres - ent in all ten binding sites of the two pentamers , although the ligand orientations differ . While the electron density of the cCTB structure primarily supports orientation 2 , most ET CTB binding sites exhibit the ligand in orientation 1 ( Fig 2F and 2G ) . Since H - tetra - BGA is an almost symmetrical molecule , the fucosyl residues are indistinguishable . As for the complexes Molecular Basis of Cholera Blood Group Dependence PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 April 15 , 2016 6 / 19 with A - penta - BGA , the fucose near residue 47 is most tightly anchored to the toxin , while the other fucose is loosely bound , by indirect water - mediated interactions . In general , the two structures are very similar , except that the N - acetyl group changes place in the two different orientations ; the axial 4 - OH group of Gal is mimicked by the α - anomer of GlcNAc ( Fig 2F , 2G and S3 Fig ) . In orientation 1 , the N - acetyl group takes the position of the GalNAc residue char - acterizing A - penta - BGA . This again points to the Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] GlcNAc trisaccharide being the central binding motif , with additional terminal residues being less important or possibly even disruptive for binding . Surface plasmon resonance Binding of the different blood group oligosaccharides to cCTB and ET CTB was further charac - terized by SPR ( Fig 3 ) . CTB was immobilized on the sensor chip , and the oligosaccharides were injected in increasing concentrations . H - tetra - BGA was found to bind both biotypes equally well ( K D = 1 . 1 / 1 . 5 mM for cCTB / ET CTB ) , whereas A - penta - BGA bound cCTB significantly stronger than ET CTB ( K D = 2 . 2 / > 30 mM for cCTB / ET CTB ) . In contrast , A - penta - HMO exhibited similar binding affinities ( K D = 2 . 7 / 4 . 6 mM for cCTB / ET CTB ) , comparable to previ - ously reported values ( K D = 1 . 2 mM , as determined by SPR for both cCTB and ET CTB [ 27 ] ; K D = 5 . 2 / 6 . 4 mM for cCTB / ET CTB , as determined by STD - NMR [ 29 ] ) . However , the new experiments showed no differences in the kinetics ; all ligands exhibited the same quick associa - tion and dissociation , and no regeneration of the SPR chips was required . Preliminary experi - ments with B - penta - BGA ( Elicityl SA ) were also performed and showed the same phenomenon as for A - penta - BGA ( K D > 30 mM ) , suggesting a strong effect of the N - acetyl group present in blood group antigens . In addition , we performed preliminary SPR experi - ments with a blood group A determinant of type - 1 structure , which showed very weak to no binding to CTB of both biotypes . Blood group antigens with type 2 core structures are well rep - resented on small intestinal glycoproteins [ 31 ] , while type 1 structures are predominantly found on glycolipids [ 32 ] . We conclude that the toxins prefer type 2 over type 1 structures , in line with previous experiments [ 24 , 33 ] . Discussion We solved the X - ray crystal structures of cCTB and ET CTB in complexes with the blood group A and H determinants , with the ambition to reveal the molecular origins of cholera blood group dependence , and followed this work up with quantitative binding analysis . We chose to work with A rather than B determinants , since A - determinants differ the most from the H - determinants . This choice also facilitates comparison with previous crystal structures . We here present the first published X - ray structures of any naturally occurring CTB variant in complex with blood group determinants , the first structures of ET CTB , and the first toxin structures in complex with the blood group H determinant . In addition we could show that the primary and secondary binding sites of the toxin can be occupied simultaneously ( Fig 2A ) . ET CTB distinguishes more strongly between A / B - and H - antigens than cCTB CTB of both V . cholerae biotypes were found to bind blood group determinants or HMOs at a secondary binding site on the lateral face of the toxin ( Fig 2A ) . The same site was identified in previous studies for A - penta - HMO binding to LTB or a CTB / LTB chimera [ 25 , 26 ] . However , the oligosaccharides exhibited unexpected orientations : both A - penta - BGA and A - penta - HMO bound to CTB in the opposite orientation compared to the other toxin structures , and H - tetra - BGA bound in both orientations .

Details are provided in the Materials and Methods section . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 . g003 Molecular Basis of Cholera Blood Group Dependence PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 April 15 , 2016 8 / 19 both cCTB and ET CTB bound to H - tetra - BGA with similar affinity ( 1 . 0 and 1 . 5 mM , respec - tively , which is comparable to H - tetra - HMO , K D = 0 . 5 mM for ET CTB [ 27 ] ) , they differed greatly in their binding affinity to A - penta - BGA ( with ET CTB binding very weakly ) . Similar observations were previously made using ITC , involving a β - glycoside of B - penta - BGA [ 28 ] . The millimolar K D values observed for the ABH blood group oligosaccharides may seem mod - est , but multivalent binding of the pentamer is expected to enhance binding avidity signifi - cantly . This has been demonstrated for GM1 [ 34 ] , and also for Shiga toxins , which bind the GD3 ganglioside with millimolar affinity , but achieve nanomolar avidity upon multivalent binding [ 35 ] . Summarizing , our experiments revealed that ET CTB can strongly distinguish between blood group A and H determinants , which both contain a GlcNAc residue at the reducing end , where human milk oligosaccharides contain unmodified Glc . In the ET CTB crystal structure , only three of ten binding sites showed sufficient electron density to warrant modeling of the entire A - penta - BGA ligand , and even then , the GalNAc residue characteristic of blood group A was disordered ( Fig 2E ) . Notably , the GalNAc residue is close to Tyr18 and not Ile47 , the substitution of which restored binding activity [ 28 ] . This was in contrast to expectations , since the ligand bound in the opposite orientation compared to the toxin struc - tures published previously [ 25 , 26 ] . In the crystal structure of ET CTB in complex with A - penta - HMO , the GalNAc residue is , however , well defined by electron density ( Fig 2D ) , strongly suggesting that interference of the reducing end N - acetyl group with Ile47 is responsi - ble for the weaker binding affinity of A - penta - BGA versus A - penta - HMO and ET CTB versus ET CTB I47T / cCTB / LTB . In addition , we observe a conformational change of Gln16 upon binding of A - penta ( BGA or HMO ) , which suggests that this residue interferes with binding in its native conformation . The structures likely represent a biologically relevant scenario The trend appears clear : The cholera toxin binds blood group H - determinants preferentially over A - determinants , suggesting that stronger binding correlates with more severe disease . The relationship is especially pronounced for the El Tor biotype , which shows the strongest blood group dependence [ 17 ] . Individuals with the ‘ secretor ’ phenotype , who also express ABO ( H ) blood group antigens on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells and mucins , experience less severe symptoms than ‘ non - secretors ’ [ 36 ] . How can this be explained ? The small intestinal mucus layer is known to serve a protective function , by blocking and removing intruding path - ogens and toxins . Stronger binding may hence be expected to correlate with enhanced protec - tion against disease rather than with increased toxicity . However , binding to the mucus layer can serve as a double - edged sword : by binding potent invaders , the invaders can also gain entrance to the host cells . Moreover , with the toxins likely being released in close proximity to the host cells [ 37 , 38 ] , the main barrier may already be overcome . But are the measured affinities at all biologically relevant ? For one , only the H - determinant , but not the A - determinant , can bind to the toxin in two alternative orientations , likely contrib - uting to its increased affinity . Both orientations should in principle be possible in the context of glycoconjugates , as long as they are β - glycosidically linked , avoiding clashes with the toxin . In this regard , we note that there is a dominance of the α - anomer of the reducing end GlcNAc in the X - ray structures , mimicking the Gal 4 - OH group , while the relevant glycoconjugates are β - glycosidically linked ( S2 Fig ) . This may influence binding affinities , and the actual differences between blood group determinants with fixed β - linkage may be even greater . Also , we need to consider that the blood group determinants are terminal epitopes of glycoconjugates , and are connected to the protein / lipid by carbohydrate linkers . The lengths of these linkers can also have an effect on the binding to CT , with shorter linkers preventing the non - reducing end of Molecular Basis of Cholera Blood Group Dependence PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 April 15 , 2016 9 / 19 the glycoconjugates from reaching to blood group binding site of the toxin . Finally , not all blood group antigens exhibit the second fucose residue ( Fuc α 3 ) , which is likely critical for binding in orientation 2 . It is very difficult to predict glycosylation based on the expression pro - files of glycosyltransferases , and only limited data exist regarding the distribution of glycocon - jugates in human tissues [ 19 , 39 ] . However , it is known that secretor fluids are characterized by enhanced fucosylation [ 40 , 41 ] , hence secretors should be able to bind a considerable fraction of the blood group antigens in orientation 2 . In addition , it has recently been shown that fuco - sylated structures promote CTB binding and cellular uptake in colonic epithelial cells [ 42 ] . Therefore we expect that the discrimination between blood group determinants observed in vitro resembles the situation in the human body . Model of the molecular basis of cholera blood group dependence The scenario may be as follows ( Fig 4 ) : After colonization of V . cholerae in the human small intestine , the bacteria secrete their main virulence factor , the cholera toxin . The small intestine is well suited for invasion , because of the limited thickness of its mucus layer , as compared to , for example , the colon . At the Peyer ’ s patches , the mucus layer is particularly thin . Moreover , after efficient intestinal colonization , the bacteria are already in close contact with the epithe - lium [ 37 , 38 ] . The secreted toxin either binds directly to the receptors on the epithelial cells or to glycoconjugates in the human mucus layer — among those , if present ( in secretors ) , the ABH blood group antigens . Also non - secretors are likely to exhibit suitable docking structures ( such as Lewis - x ( Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] GlcNAc β ) , which comprises part of H - tetra - BGA ) , but only secretors contain ABH histo - blood group antigens in their mucus and on intestinal epithelial cells [ 19 , 39 ] . Low - affinity multivalent receptor interactions with quick association - dissociation dynamics are likely essential for efficient intoxication , to ensure that the toxin reaches the epithelial cells and does not get stuck on its way ( and risk being expelled by mucus shedding ) . Once the CT reaches the epithelial cells , it may either bind to the GM1 ganglioside , to other functional recep - tors [ 43 – 45 ] , or be engulfed by an alternative mechanism involving the turn - over of brush bor - der membranes [ 46 – 48 ] . Here , it is interesting to note that based on the data presented here , the CT appears to be able to bind to blood group antigens and GM1 simultaneously . However , until the toxin is strongly bound to the cell surface , it may still diffuse away from the cells through the mucus layer . The flow around the small intestinal villi is poorly understood , but simulations suggest that during intestinal contractions , mixing and absorption around the mucosa is increased [ 49 ] . Diffusion of the toxin away from the epithelium towards the lumen of the gut is more likely to occur in secretors with blood group A or B than in those with blood group O , which bind the CT more strongly , via their H - antigens . The toxin is therefore expected to be able to enter host cells more effectively in secretors with blood group O than in those with blood groups A or B , with the effect being most pronounced for the El Tor biotype . How this compares to non - secretors is unknown , but it is conceivable that the steric interference observed for blood group A and B determinants is the main protecting factor from severe disease . Such a scenario would explain why secretors with blood groups A , B or AB are relatively protected , while those with blood group O experience more severe symptoms , as observed by Arifuzzaman et al . [ 50 ] . With (cid:1) 80 % of the human population being secretor - positive , individ - uals with blood group O would overall be more prone to severe disease , as observed [ 7 , 8 , 17 ] . Likewise , they would experience stronger protection from vaccination [ 17 ] . The scenario fur - ther explains why the El Tor biotype is more discriminatory than the classical biotype [ 17 ] . However , one should keep in mind that in recent years , a new hybrid biotype evolved , which expresses a toxin with the classical sequence [ 18 ] . This enables more effective intoxication also of individuals with blood group A or B , promoting the bacteria ’ s propagation . Molecular Basis of Cholera Blood Group Dependence PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 April 15 , 2016 10 / 19 Presence of GM1 could explain conflicting SPR data With respect to the human milk oligosaccharides , we note that previous SPR data [ 27 ] showed different binding kinetics for H - tetra - HMO and A - penta - HMO , with A - penta - HMO exhibit - ing significantly slower association / dissociation rates . In contrast , all ligands used in the Fig 4 . Molecular model of cholera blood group dependence . V . cholerae burrows through the mucus layer , aided by its flagellum and mucinases . After colonization , it produces the cholera toxin . CT ’ s interaction with the host cells depends on the person ’ s blood group and secretor status . In secretors , blood group antigens are expressed on mucins and intestinal epithelial cells . H - antigens ( characteristic of blood group O ) can bind the toxin in two orientations . They bind the toxin more strongly than A - antigens and therefore retain the toxin , increasing the risk of cellular uptake . CT has a lower affinity to A - antigens , and is therefore more easily ejected by the peristaltic movement of the intestine . This protects secretors with blood group A from severe disease , while blood group O individuals suffer more serious symptoms . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 . g004 Molecular Basis of Cholera Blood Group Dependence PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 April 15 , 2016 11 / 19 present study showed fast binding and release . The ligands used were obtained from different sources , but were otherwise identical . While the previous study was performed with com - pounds isolated from the feces of breast - fed infants ( Isosep AB ) , the SPR results presented herein are based on ligands produced by bacterial fermentation ( Elicityl SA ) . In both cases , A - penta - HMO samples were only > 90 % pure , suggesting that residual impurities may have con - tributed to the different binding profiles . Indeed , the SPR binding profile in our earlier report ( Fig 1CE in [ 27 ] ) suggests two separate binding events upon closer inspection . GM1 and GM1 - derived oligosaccharides have earlier been shown to be present in human milk [ 51 , 52 ] , and are known to strongly bind CTB [ 13 , 53 ] . The presence of trace amounts of these would explain the observed binding profiles . Preliminary ELISA experiments ( S4 Fig and S1 Methods ) support such an interpretation . Conclusions and perspective While cell biological studies are needed to establish the molecular basis of cholera blood group association , the picture becomes increasingly clear . The additional GalNAc ( or Gal ) residue in blood group A ( or B ) antigens weakens binding to the CT through steric interference . More - over , only the symmetric blood group H ( but not A ) determinants can bind to the CT in two alternative orientations . This enhances the binding capacity and the biological potency of H - antigens . While in endemic regions like Bangladesh , the blood group profile of the population has been shaped by evolution to minimize losses of human lives [ 3 , 29 , 54 ] , most of the world is less well adapted . With climate change , water - borne diseases like cholera are predicted to be aggravated worldwide [ 55 , 56 ] , with significant socioeconomic costs [ 57 ] . The molecular insights obtained in this investigation may help to stem the tide . Materials and Methods Cloning of the cCTB gene The nucleotide sequence of the classical CTB gene ( Genbank : AAC34728 . 1 ; coding for amino acid sequence 22 – 123 ) was codon - optimized for expression in Escherichia coli and synthesized by GeneArt ( Life Technologies ) in a standard pMA - T plasmid . The gene contained the N - ter - minal LTB signal sequence directing the protein to the periplasmic space , as well as flanking Nde I and Bam HI restriction sites . After excision of the gene , it was ligated into a pET - 21b ( + ) vector ( Novagen ) , and transformed by heat shock into competent E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells for protein expression . Expression and purification of cCTB The cells transformed with the pET - 21b ( + ) - cCTB plasmid were grown in LB medium supple - mented with 0 . 1 mg / ml ampicillin at 37°C until an OD 600nm of ~ 0 . 5 was reached . Before induc - tion with 0 . 5 mM IPTG , the temperature was lowered to 25°C and the protein was expressed for 16 – 20 hours . The cells were harvested by centrifugation and re - suspended in ice - cold sucrose solution ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 25 % ( w / v ) sucrose , 5 mM EDTA ) , and incubated on ice for 15 minutes . The supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 8500 × g for 20 minutes , and the pellet was re - suspended in periplasmic extraction buffer ( 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mg / ml lysozyme ) . The periplasmic fraction was separated from the cell debris by centrifugation at 8500 × g for 20 minutes , and dialyzed against PBS . cCTB was purified by affinity chromatogra - phy using D - Gal - sepharose ( Thermo Scientific ) , and was eluted with 300 mM D - Gal ( Appli - Chem ) in PBS . The protein was concentrated and applied to a Superdex75 size - exclusion chromatography column ( GE Healthcare ) , where the buffer was exchanged to 20 mM Tris pH Molecular Basis of Cholera Blood Group Dependence PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 April 15 , 2016 12 / 19 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl . The purified protein was dialyzed against Tris - storage buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl ) , concentrated to 3 – 10 mg / ml and stored at - 80°C . Expression and purification of ET CTB Vibrio sp . 60 containing the gene for ET CTB was grown in LBS medium ( LB medium with 15 g / l NaCl ) at 30°C , supplemented with 0 . 1 mg / ml ampicillin , until an OD 600nm of (cid:1) 0 . 2 . The cul - ture was induced with 0 . 5 mM IPTG and expressed for 16 – 20 hours . ET CTB is naturally secreted into the growth medium , and the cells were removed by centrifugation at 40 , 000 × g . The supernatant was applied to a D - Gal - sepharose affinity column , and ET CTB was eluted using 300 mM D - Gal in PBS . After concentration , the protein was further purified by size - exclusion chromatography ( in 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl ) and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl . The purified protein was concentrated to 3 – 10 mg / ml , and stored at - 80°C . Crystallization CTB and oligosaccharide ligands were mixed at a molar ratio of 1 : 10 ( B - subunit : ligand ) two hours prior to the crystallization setups . For the initial screening performed on an Oryx4 crys - tallization robot ( Douglas Instruments , UK ) , the sitting - drop vapor - diffusion technique was used , with a CTB concentration ranging from 3 . 0 to 8 . 5 mg / ml at 20°C . For the optimization setups , the hanging - drop vapor - diffusion technique was used with the same protein concentra - tion range , also at 20°C . All oligosaccharides were purchased from Elicityl - Oligotech ( Elicityl SA , Crolles , France ) , with the product numbers GLY035 - 5 ( A - penta - BGA : GalNAc α 3 [ Fuc α 2 ] Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] GlcNAc ) , GLY048 ( H - tetra - BGA : Fuc α 2Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] GlcNAc ) and GLY067 ( A - penta - HMO : GalNAc α 3 [ Fuc α 2 ] Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] Glc ) . Crystals of the ET CTB complexes were grown in 0 . 1 M Tris - bicine pH 8 . 5 , 9 – 12 . 5 % ( each ) PEG1000 / PEG3350 / MPD , 30 mM ( each ) CaCl 2 / MgCl 2 ( optimization of hits from the Morpheus crystallization screen ; Molecular dimensions ) . Crystals of the cCTB complexes were obtained from either 0 . 1 M Tris - bicine pH 8 . 5 , 9 – 12 . 5 % ( each ) PEG1000 / PEG3350 / MPD , 30 mM ( each ) CaCl 2 / MgCl 2 , or 0 . 1 M MES - imidazole pH 6 . 7 , 25 % PEG4000 , 5 % PGA - LM ( optimization of hits from the PGA - LM crystal - lization screen ; Molecular Dimensions ) . Diffraction quality crystals were obtained by micro - seeding , using microseed stocks prepared by crushing small crystals from initial hits with a seed bead . Most of the CTB complexes crystallized in space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , with two pentamers in the asymmetric unit , from a MORPHEUS - derived condition , except for ET CTB + H - tetra - BGA , which crystallized in P 2 1 , and cCTB + A - penta - BGA , which crystallized from the PGA - LM - derived condition , with one pentamer in the asymmetric unit ( space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 ) . Unit cell parameters are listed in Table 1 . Data collection and refinement Diffraction data for all complexes were collected at ESRF beam lines ID29 [ 58 ] or BM30A - 1 ( automated data collection by MASSIF - 1 ) . Data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1 . Data were processed and scaled using XDS [ 59 ] and Aimless from the CCP4 soft - ware suite [ 60 ] , and the structures solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP [ 61 ] or Phaser [ 62 ] , taking the atomic coordinates of the 1 . 25 Å crystal structure of CTB as a search model for molecular replacement ( PDB : 3CHB [ 63 ] ) . The search model was prepared with the program CHAINSAW [ 64 ] , removing ligands , water molecules and alternative conformations , as well as pruning non - conserved residues down to the γ atom . After molecular replacement , rigid body refinement was performed with REFMAC5 [ 65 ] , using 5 % of the data for cross - vali - dation ( R free ) . The structures were subsequently manually optimized using Coot [ 66 ] and Molecular Basis of Cholera Blood Group Dependence PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005567 April 15 , 2016 13 / 19 further refined with REFMAC5 . Automated restrained refinement and manual rebuilding were repeated in an iterative manner until no more significant changes in R - factors were observed . The ET CTB + H - tetra - BGA structure exhibited twinning ( twin fraction 0 . 1 ) , and was conse - quently refined using intensity - based twin refinement as implemented in REFMAC5 . The highest - resolution structure , cCTB + H - tetra - BGA ( 1 . 08 Å ) , was refined with anisotropic B - factors . In all structures , the sequence was corrected by substituting His94 for Thr94 , and in the ET CTB structures , in addition His18 and Thr47 were replaced by Tyr18 and Ile47 , respec - tively . After refinement of the protein alone , ordered buffer components and ions were mod - eled , before adding water molecules in several cycles . The blood group or human milk oligosaccharides were included last , to ensure unbiased and conformationally optimal model - ing . The ligands were prepared with MarvinSketch ( ChemAxon . com ) , using isomeric SMILES strings for the individual monosaccharides . The final ligand PDB and library files were created using PRODRG [ 67 ] , and were checked for errors using pdb - care ( glycosciences . de / tools / pdbcare [ 68 ] ) . The oligosaccharides were only modeled into the binding sites if clear electron density of at least three residues was present . Occupancies were refined by comparing the B - factors of the ligands with those of the interacting protein atoms , and taking the difference Fou - rier maps into account . The structures were validated using Coot [ 66 ] , Molprobity [ 69 ] , and figures prepared using PyMol ( Schrödinger LLC ) . Surface plasmon resonance SPR analyses were performed on a Biacore T100 biosensor system ( Biacore Life Sciences , GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) at the Infrastructural Centre for Analysis of Molecular Interac - tions , University of Ljubljana , Slovenia . The interaction studies were carried out at 25°C in HBS - EP running buffer ( 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 3 mM EDTA , 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) surfac - tant P20 ) ; and the carbohydrate ligands A - penta - BGA , H - tetra - BGA , A - penta - HMO were solu - bilized in the same buffer . ET CTB and cCTB were diluted in 10 mM Na - acetate pH 5 . 5 and immobilized by amine coupling to a CM5 sensor chip to a response of 4000 – 7000 RU . For the first experiments with cCTB , H - tetra - BGA and A - penta - BGA were injected over the surfaces with an initial flow rate of 20 μ l / min for 120 s ( followed by a 60 s dissociation phase and allowing 60 s of stabilization prior to the next injection ) , at increasing concentrations of the carbohydrate ligand ( 20 μ M to 10 mM ) . The experiment was repeated with two injections per concentration at 10 μ l / min for 120 s . H - tetra - BGA and A - penta - BGA ( 58 μ M to 30 mM ) were injected over the ET CTB chip with an initial flow rate of 20 μ l / min for 120 s . The experiment with H - tetra - BGA was repeated with two injections per concentration ( 29 μ M to 15 mM ) at a flow rate of 10 μ l / min for 120 s . Finally , both ligands were tested against both toxin biotypes using three randomized injections per concentration ( 313 μ M to 10 mM ) , at a flow rate of 5 μ l / min for 30 s . A - penta - HMO was tested at a separate occasion , using the same chip for cCTB ( quality tested by a repeti - tion of H - tetra - BGA ) , but a newly immobilized chip for ET CTB ( (cid:1) 6000 RU ) . The graphs for A - penta - HMO are therefore not comparable to the rest . The experiments with A - penta - HMO ( 39 μ M to 20 mM ) were performed with a flow rate of 10 μ l / min for 120 s , with three separate runs . No regeneration was required for any of the interactions . The dissociation constants ( K D ) of the interactions were calculated by using a steady - state affinity model in the Biacore T100 evaluation software . Preliminary experiments were performed with B - penta - BGA ( GLY38 - 5 , Gal α 3 [ Fuc α 2 ] Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] GlcNAc ) ( Elicityl SA ) and A - penta - BGA - type - 1 ( GLY35 - 4 , Gal - NAc α 3 [ Fuc α 2 ] Gal β 3 [ Fuc α 4 ] GlcNAc ) ( Elicityl SA ) . The binding of B - penta - BGA was measured with a single concentration series from 39 μ M to 20 mM ( 5 μ l / min , 60 s ) for cCTB , and from 39 μ M to 10 mM ( 5 μ l / min , 60 s ) for ET CTB , while A - penta - BGA - type - 1 was only manually tested at 1 mM and 5 mM concentrations for cCTB , and at 1 mM for ET CTB .
