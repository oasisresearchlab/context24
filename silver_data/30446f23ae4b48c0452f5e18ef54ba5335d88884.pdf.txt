To determine how FA composition is modulated by myosinII activity , we performed proteomic analysis of isolated FAs and compared protein abundance in FAs from cells with and without myosinII inhibition . We identified FA 905 proteins , 459 of which changed in FA abundance with myosinII inhibition , defining the myosinII - responsive FA proteome . FA abundance of 73 % of proteins was enhanced by contractility , including those involved in Rho - mediated FA maturation and endocytosis - and calpain - dependent FA disassembly . 27 % of proteins , including those involved in Rac - mediated lamellipodial protrusion , were enriched in FA by myosinII inhibition , establishing for the first time negative regulation of FA protein recruitment by contractility . We focused on the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor , β - PIX , documenting its role in negative regulation of FA maturation and promotion of lamellipodial protrusion , FA turnover to drive cell migration . Integrin - mediated focal adhesions ( FAs ) are dynamic , multifunctional organelles that facilitate cell adhesion , force transmission and cytoskeleton regulation , as well as signaling that controls cell division , differentiation , or apoptosis 1 , 2 . The diverse FA functionality is reflected in their complex composition . Over 150 different proteins are known to associate with FAs making up the “Integrin Adhesome” 3 . The Adhesome includes cytoskeletal - binding and adapter proteins and enzymes including kinases , phosphatases , phospholipases Users may view , print , copy , download and text and data - mine the content in such documents , for the purposes of academic research , subject always to the full Conditions of use : http : / / www . nature . com / authors / editorial _ policies / license . html # terms * correspondence to : Clare M .

Furthermore , FA composition is heterogeneous and dynamic , even across different FAs within a single cell 4 . However , no FA compositions have been ascribed to specific downstream functions . One important regulator of FA composition is physical perturbation 5 , 6 . FAs are mechanosensitive and recruit proteins to grow , and change composition in response to tension in the process of FA maturation 7 – 9 . Tension driving FA maturation is supplied either by myosinII activity or external forces applied to the cell 9 , 10 . Forces on tension - sensitive FA proteins drive conformational changes that unmask binding sites for non - tension - sensitive proteins 11 . Thus , tension - mediated protein recruitment regulates FA composition to mediate outcome determination downstream of integrin - mediated adhesion 12 . The cascade of FA compositional changes during myosinII - mediated FA maturation is being elucidated for a small fraction of the Adhesome . After integrin activation by talin 13 , the adapter paxillin and the tyrosine kinase FAK are recruited to nascent FA 14 – 16 . FA growth is accompanied by recruitment of vinculin 17 , 18 , which strengthens the integrin – talin - actin link 19 , 20 . This is followed by formin - mediated elongation of an actin / α - actinin bundle , where adapter proteins zyxin and tensin accumulate 9 , 17 , 21 . Tension on integrins also promotes FAK and Src activation 22 , 23 which phosphorylate tyrosines on paxillin and p130cas forming binding sites for SH2 domain - containing proteins 24 . However , major differences in biological response downstream of integrin engagement are likely mediated by more significant FA compositional Here , we utilized proteomic analysis to characterize FA composition changes induced by myosinII inhibition . We find myosinII mediates major compositional changes in FA . We focus on a Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) , β - Pix whose FA abundance was enhanced by myosinII inhibition and demonstrate its role in negative regulation of FA maturation by promoting Rac1 activation , lamellipodial protrusion , and nascent FA turnover . RESULTS Development and validation of an FA isolation method To characterize FA composition and its modification by myosinII activity , we developed a FA isolation method for HFF1 fibroblasts , minimizing contamination by actin stress fibers 25 ( Fig . 1a ) . Cells were hypotonically shocked and strongly triturated to remove cell bodies and majority of the cytoskeleton , leaving substrate - bound FAs , together with a subset of thin and / or fragmented stress fibers for collection and analysis . Imaging cells expressing GFP - paxillin during hypotonic shock revealed no effects on FA morphology ( Supplemental Fig . S1a ) . Anti - paxillin immunostaining of FA in intact cells , hypotonically shocked cells , and FAs on the substrate after trituration revealed no difference in size and spatial organization ( Fig . 1b ) . Quantifying fluorescence density ( intensity / μm 2 ) of immunolocalized paxillin , vinculin , zyxin , talin , phospho - tyrosine , and VASP in FAs showed that neither hypotonic shock nor trituration altered their FA abundance compared to intact cells , and no proteins remained on the substrate after FA collection ( Supplemental Fig . S1b ) . We also compared the concentration of FA proteins ( paxillin , vinculin , talin , VASP , actin , phosphorylated paxillin , and phosphorylated FAK ) , soluble ( GAPDH ) , cytoskeletal ( tubulin ) , and membrane - associated components ( Akt and FGFR ) in isolated FA and cell body fractions by Kuo et al .

This confirmed that the isolation method concentrated FA components in the FA fraction and separated and concentrated soluble , cytoskeletal , and membrane - associated components in the cell body fraction ( Fig . 1c ) . The presence of FA proteins in the cell body fraction agrees with their known localizations to non - FA structures . Therefore , our FA isolation method preserves native FA organization and size and association of known FA proteins . Proteomic analysis of isolated FAs Isolated HFF1 FAs were then analyzed by multidimensional protein identification technology mass spectrometry ( MudPIT MS ) 26 . FAs were collected , solubilized , denatured , and the abundant proteins actin and fibronectin removed by immunodepletion . Remaining proteins were reduced , alkylated , protease digested and separated by two - dimensional liquid chromatography prior to MS analysis . Tandem mass spectra were generated and matched to peptides in a human protein database using SEQUEST ™27 . Each protein is represented by multiple mass spectra ( sequence counts ) from different peptide fragments , and each peptide fragment can be detected multiple times . Protein abundance was thus quantified as the sum of all mass spectra identified per protein ( spectrum counts ) . We applied two criteria for considering a protein a reproducibly identified component of isolated FAs ( Fig . 2a ) . To be included in a “detectable list” required presence of one or more sequence count and a false positive protein identification rate of less than 1 % 28 ( Supplemental Methods ) . Inclusion in the “reproducible list” required inclusion in the detectable list in at least two out of three replicate runs . By these criteria , 1917 and 754 proteins were identified as detectible and reproducible components of isolated FA , respectively ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . Although the reproducibly identified proteins may include cytosolic and cytoskeletal contaminants , this first comprehensive analysis of FA composition likely includes many undiscovered FA proteins . We classified the reproducibly identified proteins in isolated FA according to their cell biological function . Of the 150 proteins in the Integrin Adhesome 3 , 72 and 50 proteins were identified in our detectable and reproducible lists , respectively . Cell type or ECM composition differences , or protein susceptibility to digestion may underlie our inability to identify all Adhesome proteins . 283 proteins were grouped into an “expected FA list” based on further literature analysis . This included the 50 proteins in the Adhesome as well as proteins in the same family ( 24 ) , known to interact with ( 142 ) , or subunits of a macromolecular complex ( 47 ) of an Adhesome member , as well as 20 FA associated proteins that were not included in the Adhesome ( Fig . 2b ) . Thus , nearly 40 % ( 283 out of 754 total ) of the reproducibly identified proteins could be expected to be present in FAs based on their known properties ( Fig . 2c ) , providing further validation of our FA isolation and protein identification method . We illustrate our FA composition , with an interactome of proteins in our expected FA list ( Supplemental Fig . S2 ) , with protein functional classification color - coded and characterized interactions indicated by overlap ( Supplemental Table 2 and http : / / dir . nhlbi . nih . gov / papers / lctm / focaladhesion / Home / index . html ) . The remaining ~ 60 % ( 471 out of 754 total ) of reproducibly identified proteins in isolated FA ( Supplemental Table 3 ) were either uncharacterized , had no known association with , Kuo et al .

These may be undiscovered or weakly associated or transient FA proteins , or cytosolic and / or cytoskeletal contaminants . These were classified according to biological function : endomembrane systems / trafficking ( 129 ) ; uncharacterized ( 84 ) ; cytoskeleton ( 81 ) ; metabolism ( 70 ) ; plasma membrane channels / transporters ( 36 ) ; RNA / DNA processing ( 31 ) ; cytosolic signaling ( 25 ) ; or folding / degradation ( 15 ) . The large proportion of cytoskeletal and endomembrane trafficking proteins is not surprising , given that part of actin stress fibers were isolated with FA , and all three cytoskeletal systems associate with FAs 29 , while endomembrane trafficking regulates FA turnover 30 . Similarly , membrane channels are included in the plasma membrane present in FA . However , the purpose of this study is not comprehensive documentation of bona fide FA proteins , but rather determination of FA composition changes mediated by myosinII activity . “MyosinII Dependence Ratio” ( MDR ) quantifies the myosinII activity - dependence of protein abundance in FAs We next characterized the effects of myosinII inhibition on protein composition and abundance in isolated FAs . MyosinII activity was inhibited with blebbistatin ( 50μM , 2hr ) . Immunolocalization of paxillin in intact cells showed that blebbistatin abolished large , central FA and induced small , peripheral FA , with FA of a similar size and spatial distribution remaining substrate - bound after isolation ( Fig . 3a , b ) . MudPIT MS analysis of isolated FA from blebbistatin - treated cells revealed reproducible identification of 665 proteins ( Supplemental Table 4 ) , 517 of which ( 78 % ) were reproducibly identified in FA of control cells , for a total of 905 proteins from both conditions ( 237 proteins only in control FAs , 148 proteins only in blebbistatin - treated FAs , and 517 proteins in both conditions ) . To evaluate the relative changes in protein abundance in FAs isolated from control and blebbistatin - treated cells , we developed a normalized , ratio - based metric , the “MyosinII Dependence Ratio” ( MDR ) , that represents the dependence of a protein’s abundance in FA on myosinII activity . MDR was the ratio of normalized protein abundance ( total spectrum counts ) in control FAs to that in FAs from blebbistatin - treated cells ( Fig . 3c , Supplemental Methods ) . Because digestion and detection efficiencies are independent of sample origin , spectrum counts accurately reflect relative change in protein abundance in similarly prepared samples 31 , 32 . Thus MDR < 1 indicates myosinII activity inhibits the protein’s accumulation in FA , MDR close to 1 indicates myosinII activity - independent FA association , and MDR > 1 indicates myosinII activity - dependent enrichment in FA . We validated MudPIT MS - based MDR results by comparison to western blot and two - dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis analysis ( 2D - DIGE ) 33 . Western analysis ( 20 different proteins ) and 2D - DIGE ( 21 different proteins ) comparison of protein abundance in isolated FA from control and blebbistatin - treated cells revealed corroboration rates of 95 % ( Supplemental Table 5 ) and 90 % ( Supplemental Fig . S3 and Table 6 ) with MDRs , respectively . Thus , MDR provides a reliable metric for determining how myosinII activity effects relative abundance of proteins in FAs . Kuo et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t MyosinII activity promotes FA accumulation of FA assembly , maturation , and disassembly factors , and FA loss of lamellipodial protrusion factors To characterize how FA composition is modulated by myosinII activity , proteins were categorized according to their MDR magnitude . Of the 905 reproducibly identified proteins in FA of control and blebbistatin - treated cells , 459 proteins ( 51 % ) showed > / = 2 - fold difference in abundance between conditions . These included 335 proteins with MDR > 2 , indicating FA enrichment by myosinII contraction . Surprisingly , 124 proteins exhibited MDR < 0 . 5 , indicating suppression of their FA abundance by myosinII activity ( Fig . 4a ) . Many proteins exibited changes between 1 . 25 ~ 2 - fold ( MDR : 1 . 25 – 2 or 0 . 5 – 0 . 8 ) . This represents either minor myosinII - dependent changes in FA abundance , or low confidence / low detectability by MudPIT methods . Thus , myosinII activity both positively and negatively effects FA enrichment of proteins to promote major changes in FA composition . We created a myosinII - responsive FA interactome from proteins in the expected FA list by color - coding proteins according to MDR magnitude ( Supplemental Fig . S4 and Table 7 , http : / / dir . nhlbi . nih . gov / papers / lctm / focaladhesion / Home / index . html ) . The interactome illustrates the full range of MDR values , including proteins exhibiting minor / low confidence changes . This interactome suggests how myosinII activity may collectively modulate FA abundance of groups of proteins mediating distinct pathways . Proteins known to be involved in pathways of myosinII - mediated FA maturation and stress fiber formation were enriched in FA of controls compared to blebbistatin - treated cells ( Fig . 4b ) . This included minor FA enrichment of RhoA 7 ( MDR : 1 . 29 ) and greater enrichment of enhancers of Rho activity including GEF - H1 34 ( MDR : 2 . 00 ) , TRIP6 35 ( MDR : 3 . 86 ) and testin 36 ( MDR : 6 . 65 ) . Stress fiber formation regulators enriched in control FAs included the actin bundling proteins α - actinin 37 ( MDR : 4 . 19 ) , synaptopodin - 2 38 ( MDR : 2 . 60 ) , supervillin 39 , 40 ; formin - 2 41 ( MDR : 1 . 86 ) , and several PDZ - LIM cytoskeletal adapters 42 ( zyxin , MDR : 2 . 91 ; PDLI1 , MDR : 6 . 77 ; PDLI4 , MDR : 2 . 93 ; PDLI5 , MDR : 1 . 33 ; PDLI7 , MDR : 2 . 11 ; and FHL2 , MDR : 2 . 07 ) . MyosinII inhibition also reduced FA abundance of factors mediating integrin - actin linkage 13 , 43 – 45 ( Fig . 4c ) . FA accumulation of migfilin ( MDR : 9 . 72 ) and filamins ( filamin - 1 , MDR : 2 . 88 ; filamin - B , MDR : 2 . 31 ; and filamin - C , MDR : 2 . 50 ) was strongly inhibited by blebbistatin . Blebbistatin also weakly inhibited FA abundance of talin - 1 ( MDR : 1 . 33 ) and vinculin ( MDR : 1 . 41 ) and its binding partner , vinexin 46 ( MDR : 1 . 59 ) , Thus , myosinII activity promotes FA accumulation of integrin - cytoskeletal linkers . Disassembly of mature FA is regulated by calpain - mediated proteolysis 47 and / or endocytosis of integrins 30 , 48 . Components of both of these pathways were strongly enriched in FA from control cells compared to blebbistatin - treated cells . This included calpain - 2 and components of both clathrin - dependent ( clathrin heavy chain - 1 , MDR : 2 . 08 ; clathrin adapters Dab2 , MDR : 2 . 74 and numb , MDR : 1 . 94 ) and caveolin - mediated , clathrin - independent pathways ( caveolin - 1 , MDR : 2 . 21 ; scaffolding proteins flotillin - 1 , MDR : 12 and flotillin - 2 MDR : 1 . 48 ) ( Fig . 4d ) . This suggests mature FAs recruit disassembly factors by a myosinII - dependent pathway . Kuo et al . Page 5 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 February 14 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Surprisingly , we also found proteins involved in Rac1 - mediated lamellipodial protrusion were strongly enriched in FA of blebbistatin - treated cells compared to controls , indicating negative regulation of their FA recruitment by myosinII activity . Although Rac1 ( MDR : 2 . 47 ) itself was more enriched in FA of control cells , myosinII inhibition caused FA enrichment of Rac1 activators , effectors , and downstream targets ( Fig . 4e ) . Rac1 activators included the Rac guaninine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) β - PIX 49 ( MDR : 0 . 27 ) and the Rac GEF modulator , EPS8 50 ( MDR : 0 . 48 ) , while PKA 51 and its A - kinase activating protein , MAP2 52 , MIF 53 , and the RhoA inhibitor RhoGDI 54 ( MDR : 0 . 19 ) have all my indirectly promote Rac1 activation . Rac1 effectors included IRSP53 55 and N - WASP 55 , 56 ( MDR : 0 . 26 ) , both mediators of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization . Rac1 downstream targets involved in actin treadmilling included Arp2 / 3 ( ( ARC1A ( MDR : 0 . 24 ) , ARC1B ( MDR : 0 . 68 ) , ARPC3 ( MDR : 0 . 69 ) , ARP5L ( MDR : 0 . 74 ) ) , cofilin 57 ( MDR : 0 . 46 ) and its activator PP2A 58 ( MDR : 0 . 21 ) , and the actin monomer binding protein Cap1 59 ( MDR : 0 . 25 ) . Contractility - mediated FA maturation promotes β - PIX dissociation from nascent FAs To understand how myosinII activity negatively regulates Rac1 and lamellipodial protrusion , we focused on the Rac GEF β - PIX . Immunoblotting FA fractions validated myosinII’s negative regulation of β - PIX accumulation in FA , showing a 3 . 73 - fold concentration of β - PIX in FA by myosinII inhibition compared to control , similar to the MDR ( 3 . 7 - fold ( 1 / MDR ) ( Fig . 5a ) ) . Quantifying the ratio of fluorescence density of paxillin and β - PIX in FA showed that myosinII inhibition did not significantly effects paxillin FA density , but significantly increased ( 25 % ) FA density of β - PIX compared to control ( Fig . 5b , c ) . β - PIX accumulation in FAs was also regulated by physiological downregulation of myosinII contractility 60 , since western blot of isolated FAs and immunofluorescence analysis revealed increased accumulation of β - PIX in FAs from cells plated on compliant compared to stiffer substrates ( Fig . 5d , e , f ) . Thus , β - PIX concentration in FAs is negatively regulated by myosinII contractility . To determine if FA maturation modulates FA abundance of β - PIX , we quantified the ratio of fluorescence density in immature ( < 2μm 2 ) relative to mature ( > 2μm 2 ) FA . This revealed 9 % more paxillin in big compared small to FAs , but 25 % less β - PIX ( Fig . 5b , c ) . Analysis of mApple - paxillin and eGFP - β - PIX during FA maturation showed that paxillin and β - PIX concentrations and FA area all increased at similar rates as nascent FA assembled . Subsequently , FA area increase slowed , paxillin continued to accumulate , but β - PIX level did not increase and eventually decreased in large , paxillin - dense FA ( Fig . 5g ) . Analysis of paxillin and β - PIX during perfusion of Y27632 to inhibit ROCK ( 10μM ; blebbistatin could not be used due to phototoxicity ) revealed that reducing contraction caused dissociation of paxillin and FA shrinkage , concomittant with association of β - PIX , followed by adhesion turnover ( Fig . 5h and Supplemental Fig . S5 ) . Thus , β - PIX concentrates in assembling nascent FAs in the absence of myosinII contractility , and it dissociates from FA during myosinII - meditated FA maturation . Kuo et al .

Immunolocalization of paxillin and the lamellipodia marker , cortactin , in GFP - β - PIX - expressing cells showed that β - PIX localized in nascent FAs in lamellipodia 63 , 64 induced by blebbistatin ( Fig . 6a ) . Lentiviral expression of shRNAs to inhibit β - PIX expression abrogated the blebbistatin - induced enhancement of cell spreading and decreased the ratio of lamellipodia area to total cell area 65 ( Fig . 6b and Supplemental Fig . S7 ) . Rac1 - GTP pulldown assays revealed that in cells expressing control shRNAs , Rac1 activity was increased by blebbistatin treatment 61 ( Fig . 6c ) , while blebbistatin - induced Rac1 activation was abolished by β - PIX knockdown . This inhibitory effect was not induced by silencing the related FA - associated Rac GEF , α - PIX , and was rescued by re - expressing myc - tagged mouse β - PIX ( Fig . 6c , Supplemental Fig . S6 ) . Thus , β - PIX is required for lamellipodial formation , cell shape changes , and Rac1 activity induced by inhibition of myosinII . To determine the role of β - PIX in FA maturation , we altered β - PIX levels and analyzed FA size . Overexpression of β - PIX abrogated mid - sized ( 2 – 6 μm 2 ) FA , promoted small FA ( < 2 μm 2 ) at the cell periphery , and significantly increased the proportion of small FA compared to controls ( Fig . 7a , b ) . In contrast , silencing β - PIX abrogated small peripheral FA and increased mid - sized FA ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Analysis of mApple - paxillin ( Fig . 7c ) revealed that β - PIX silencing had little effect on FA assembly rate ( Fig . 7c ) or maximal paxillin level ( Fig . 7e ) , but slowed FA disassembly ( Fig . 7c ) , significantly increasing FA lifetime compared to control ( Fig . 7d ) . Silencing β - PIX also reduced migration velocity compared to controls , and abrogated the enhancement of cell velocity induced by inhibiting myosinII with blebbistatin ( Fig . 7f , Supplemental Table 9 ) . Thus , β - PIX drives rapid nascent FA turnover , negatively regulating FA maturation and enhancing cell migration . DISCUSSION We developed a proteomics approach to profile global FA composition changes in response to inhibition of myosinII activity to better understand myosinII - driven FA maturation . This method provides a powerful approach for dissecting FA composition changes in response to different stimuli or molecular perturbations 25 . Our FA proteome contained 905 proteins , supporting the notion that FA are complex organelles . Whether all these proteins participate in FA function is unknown . More importantly , we show that protein abundance of half ( 459 / 905 ) the FA proteome is altered by myosinII activity and half remain constant as core FA components or non - specific contaminants . Most FA compositional change is likely not caused by myosinII ATPase activity acting directly on FA proteins or indicative of protein tension sensitivity per se , but reflects downstream effects of myosinII - mediated mechanotransduction . Our results define the myosinII - responsive FA proteome , indicating substantial compositional differences between immature and mature FA . Inhibiting myosinII reduced FA abundance of 73 % of the myosinII - responsive FA proteome , supporting the established role of myosinII as an enhancer of FA protein recruitment . However , surprisingly , inhibition of myosinII induced FA enrichment of 27 % of the myosinII - Kuo et al . Page 7 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 February 14 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t responsive FA proteome , indicating for the first time that myosinII is an important negative regulator of FA protein recrutiment . FA composition in myosinII - inhibited cells likely reflects that in nascent FA that form and turn over rapidly during lamellipodial protrusion in the absence of local myosinII activity 66 , 67 , and which are critical to cell migration 17 . Though our controls include FA of various maturation states , their FA composition is likely dominated by larger and more abundant matured FA in the lamella and cell center which are disassembling or specialized for ECM remodeling . Whether similar FA compositional changes occur is being investigated . Our results suggest a model in which myosinII activity regulates FA maturation and turnover by collectively modulating the FA abundance of protein functional modules mediating specialization of FA for cell migration . FA abundance of inside - out integrin activation , ( talins , kindlins ) was not myosinII - sensitive , supporting the notion that nascent FA formation is contractility - independent 17 . Our results suggest that , independent of contractility , activated integrin complexes recruit Rac1 activators ( β - PIX , EPS8 , MIF , PKA ) and Rac1 effectors ( IRSP53 , N - WASP ) and their targets involved in dendritic actin treadmilling ( Arp2 / 3 , cofilin - 1 , CAP - 1 ) . This suggests a positive feedback mechanism in which lamellipodial protrusion is coupled to formation of nascent FA that recruit a Rac1 regulatory module which propagates further protrusion and nascent FA formation to drive cell migration . Nascent FA subjected to myosinII contractility exhibit both dissociation and recruitment of protein functional modules that mediate FA strengthening , stress fiber formation , and mature FA disassembly ( Fig . 7g ) . We find that myosinII promotes enrichment of proteins that strengthen the integrin - actin linkage ( migfilin , filamins , vinculin ) . At the same time , contractility drives FA dissociation of the Rac1 regulatory module to terminate the nascent FA turnover loop and allow FA maturation . MyosinII - driven loss of the Rac1 module is mirrored by recruitment of RhoA , its activators ( GEF - H1 , TRIP6 , testin ) , and downstream targets and stress fiber proteins including actin - bundling proteins ( α - actinin , supervillin , formin - 2 , and synaptopodin - 2 ) and cytoskeletal adapters ( PDLI1 , PDLI4 , PDLI5 , PDLI7 , zyxin , and FHL2 ) . Contraction also drives FA disassembly 15 by recruiting calpain and clathrin - dependent and caveolin - mediated endocytosis protein modules . . To support the role of myosinII in negative regulation of a Rac1 regulatory module in FA , we focused on the Rac GEF β - PIX , and examined the myosinII - dependence of its role in nascent FA turnover and lamellipodial protrusion 63 , 64 . We find that β - PIX concentrates in nascent FA 64 , and dissociates from FA as they mature . We show that β - PIX is required for Rac1 activity and lamellipodial protrusion induced by myosinII inhibition , suggesting that β – PIX may enhance Rac1 activity locally in myosinII - free cell regions such as lamellipodia . Finally , we show that β - PIX is required for rapid nascent FA turnover , implicating it in negative regulation of FA maturation and enhancement of cell migration . Kuo et al .
