Open Access Socioeconomic differences in COVID‑19 infection , hospitalisation and mortality in urban areas in a region in the South of Europe Nicolás F Fernández‑Martínez 1 , 2 , Rafael Ruiz‑Montero 1 , 2 * , Diana Gómez‑Barroso 3 , 4 , Alejandro Rodríguez‑Torronteras 1 , Nicola Lorusso 5 , Inmaculada Salcedo‑Leal 1 , 2 and Luis Sordo 4 , 6 Abstract Background : To analyse differences in confirmed cases , hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID‑19 related to cen‑ sus section socioeconomic variables . Methods : Ecological study in the 12 largest municipalities in Andalusia ( Spain ) during the first three epidemic waves of the COVID‑19 ( 02 / 26 / 20—03 / 31 / 21 ) , covering 2 , 246 census sections ( unit of analysis ) and 3 , 027 , 000 inhabitants . Incidence was calculated , standardised by age and sex , for infection , hospitalisation and deaths based on average gross income per household ( AGI ) for the census tracts in each urban area . Association studied using a Poisson Bayes‑ ian regression model with random effects for spatial smoothing . Results : There were 140 , 743 cases of COVID‑19 , of which 12 , 585 were hospitalised and 2 , 255 died . 95 . 2 % of cases were attributed to the second and third waves , which were jointly analysed . We observed a protective effect of income for infection in 3 / 12 cities . Almeria had the largest protective effect ( smoothed relative risk ( SRR ) = 0 . 84 ( 0 . 75 – 0 . 94 CI 95 % ) . This relationship reappeared with greater magnitude in 10 / 12 cities for hospitalisation , lowest risk in Algeciras SRR = 0 . 41 ( 0 . 29 – 0 . 56 ) . The pattern was repeated for deaths in all urban areas and reached statistical significance in 8 cities . Lowest risk in Dos Hermanas SRR = 0 . 35 ( 0 . 15 – 0 . 81 ) . Conclusions : Income inequalities by geographical area were found in the incidence of COVID‑19 . The strengths of the association increased when analysing the severe outcomes of hospitalisations and , above all , deaths . Keywords : COVID‑19 , Urbanization , Geographical , Mortality , Hospitalisation , Socio‑economic status Background The coronavirus disease of 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) has been marked by the lack of prior knowledge of its charac - teristics , an initial underestimation of its impact and delayed decision - making in terms of healthcare measures and public health [ 1 ] . This has resulted in very different disease management in different countries , according to the profiles of their inhabitants [ 2 ] . Despite these differences , evidence suggests that COVID - 19 has had a greater effect on populations with worse socioeconomic characteristics [ 3 , 4 ] , and it has been particularly acute , as with other infectious dis - eases , in urban populations [ 5 , 6 ] . In urban areas , con - tact between people is more frequent than in rural areas , especially in areas with worse social determinants of COVID - 19 , such as working and living conditions [ 7 ] . Throughout the pandemic , the consequences of these socioeconomic inequalities in the urban context have not * Correspondence : rafaelruizmontero @ gmail . com 1 Unidad de Gestión Clínica Medicina Preventiva y Salud Pública , Hospital Universitario Reina Sofía , Córdoba 14004 , Spain Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 10 Fernández‑Martínez et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 2316 been limited to infections . There have also been higher mortality rates [ 8 ] and hospitalisation rates [ 9 ] in under - privileged urban areas . It should be noted that many studies were conducted at different time points early in the pandemic or were carried out without differentiating between different time points , which might contribute to the inconsistent findings [ 10 , 11 ] . Hospitalisations and mortality due to COVID - 19 are the two issues that have most affected political and public health measures , such as confinements and curfews , and have put the health care infrastructure at risk [ 11 , 12 ] . In many countries , including Spain , COVID - 19 has had an impact during two different time periods with very different characteristics [ 10 ] . There are notable differ - ences between the first wave , which began in February of 2020 , in which there was scant awareness of the disease compared to the following waves . The first wave in Spain provoked greater excess mortality than in any other Euro - pean country [ 13 ] . However , this wave hit certain zones hard , while in others it was much less relevant . In Anda - lusia , for example , confinement took place when there were still very few cases in the region [ 14 ] . By mid - July , when new infections started to rise again ( with the begin - ning of the second wave ) , more than 27 , 000 deaths had been officially registered in Spain as cases of COVID - 19 [ 14 , 15 ] . Only five per cent came from Andalusia , a region with 17 . 9 per cent of the Spanish population . COVID - 19 had a much greater impact in Andalusia during the sec - ond and third waves , accounting for around 30 per cent of cases and deaths in Spain [ 14 ] . Despite the existence of research on the association between sociodemographic risk factors and COVID - 19 , especially concerning urban areas [ 3 , 4 , 7 , 16 , 17 ] , there are few studies that evaluate the risk of infection , hos - pitalisation and death due to the virus in a single study population . Furthermore , in order to accurately interpret the influence of socioeconomic factors on these out - comes , biased data from the first wave ( diagnostic bias ) should be considered separately [ 11 ] . The objective of this study was to analyse socioeco - nomic differences in the 12 primary urban areas in Anda - lusia ( Spain ) in terms of confirmed cases , hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID - 19 during the first three epi - demic waves of the pandemic . Materials and methods We carried out an ecological , retrospective study of the first three epidemic waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic in the primary urban areas in Andalusia , Spain . Variables The units of analysis were the census sections ( small territorial units inside a neighbourhood encompassing approximately between 1 , 000 and 2 , 500 inhabitants ) in urban areas ( territorial units defined by population vol - ume criteria and by territorial features ) . The sociode - mographic variables were : the number of inhabitants ( aggregated and disaggregated by sex and age ) and aver - age annual gross income per household ( AGI ) in euros . The epidemiological variables were : confirmed cases of COVID - 19 , as defined by the Spanish Ministry of Health ( which mainly considered the laboratory criteria of con - firmed PCR or antigen test to SARS - CoV - 2 , depending on the period of the pandemic [ 18 ] ) , hospitalisation of confirmed COVID - 19 cases , deaths of confirmed cases of COVID - 19 , and epidemic waves , defined by the accel - eration and deceleration of the number of new cases of COVID - 19 ( first epidemic wave : February 26 [ first con - firmed case in Andalusia ] to July 12 , 2020 ; second wave : July 13 to December 27 , 2020 ; third wave : December 28 , 2020 to March 31 , 2021 ) . Information sources The most recent available information on demographic data ( 2019 ) and AGI ( 2018 ) came from the National Sta - tistics Institute ( NSI ) [ 19 ] . However , given that AGI in 2018 was available for 99 . 1 per cent of census sections , information for prior years was used for the rest : 2017 ( 0 . 3 % ) , 2016 ( 0 . 1 % ) and 2015 ( 0 . 4 % ) . In 0 . 2 per cent of census sections there were no available data on AGI , thus they were excluded from the analysis . The confirmed COVID - 19 cases in terms of diagnosis , hospitalisation and deaths—geocoding ( X and Y coordinates ) - and the information on institutionalisation in elderly or disabil - ity care centres ( these cases were excluded due to the risk of interference with the spatial analysis ) were obtained from the Epidemiological Surveillance System of Anda - lusia ( SVEA ) . Finally , in order to establish cut - off points between epidemic waves , information on the evolution of the pandemic in the study area was obtained from the Andalusian Institute of Statistics and Cartography [ 20 ] . The dependent variable was calculated using the stand - ardised incidence ratio ( SIR ) for COVID - 19 for three outcomes of interest : cases of infection , hospitalisation and deaths . The independent variables were AGI , age and sex ( these were used for the standardisation of rates ) . Study area This study exclusively analysed the 12 municipalities in Andalusia with a population over 100 , 000 inhabitants [ 21 ] . In total , these urban areas bring together 2 , 246 cen - sus sections and 3 , 027 , 000 inhabitants , which represents 36 per cent of the population of Andalusia and 6 per cent of the total population in Spain ( Fig . 1 ) . Page 3 of 10 Fernández‑Martínez et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 2316 Statistical analysis The first wave was analysed individually , and the second and third waves were analysed jointly . The reason for dividing the period into two - time windows - and for our work , focusing on the second of these windows - is that the data related to the first wave were biased due to the limited accessibility of COVID - 19 diagnostic tests [ 10 , 13 , 22 ] . In contrast , despite the existence of differences , the second and third waves are reasonably comparable due to uniformity in the definition of a confirmed case and the general availability of the SARS - CoV - 1 antigen tests , thus they were analysed together . The temporal stratification was carried out in terms of the first wave vs the second and third waves . The spatial analysis using the Bayesian model was carried out stratifying by urban area , so each urban area was analysed independently . In summary , three outcomes were studied : the standardised incidence ratio ( SIR ) of COVID - 19 at the case and hos - pitalisation levels and the standardised mortality ratio ( SMR ) of COVID - 19 , in 12 urban areas and in two time windows . In order to carry out the statistical analysis , the SIR of COVID - 19 was calculated , standardised by sex and age ( categorised into 21 quinquennial groups ) . The SIR was obtained using the quotient of the observed and expected cases , by way of indirect standardisation , setting as ref - erence ( SIR = 1 ) the average ratio across census sections of all municipalities . Later , we employed a Bayesian spa - tial model to investigate spatial risk factors for the three aforementioned COVID - 19 outcomes . In order to avoid the effect of small areas , we calculated the smoothed rela - tive risk ( SRR ) , setting as reference ( SSR = 1 ) the average risk across census sections among each urban area . To do so , we used the model proposed by Besag , York and Mollié [ 23 ] of spatial smoothing using Poisson regression with random effects , which represents the heterogeneity of each geographic unit and the spatial contiguity , based on an auto - regressive conditional model ( CAR ) . where : λi is the relative risk in area i ; Oi the number of cases in area i , α the constant , Ei the expected number of cases , hi the ordinary random - effects component for non - spatial heterogeneity among census sections and bi the spatial term . Finally , the logarithm of AGI for each census section was added to the model as an independent covariable 0 i ∼ Po ( Ei (cid:31) i ) log ( (cid:31) i ) = α + hi + bi Fig . 1 Location of studied urban areas Page 4 of 10 Fernández‑Martínez et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 2316 ( analysed as a quantitative continuous variable ) . The sta - tistical analysis was carried out with R software ( version 4 . 0 . 3 ) , using the spatial analysis package R - INLA . Patient and public involvement Due to the ecological and non - interventional nature of the study we have not involved the public in the design or conduct of our research . Results Figure 1 shows the location of the urban areas studied . The distribution of AGI was non - normal and heterogene - ous in all of them . The AGI ranged from 13 , 000 € in the census section with the lowest income to 123 , 000 € in the census section with the highest income , although both of the first two quintiles were under 30 , 000 € and the third was below 35 , 000 € ( Fig . 2 ) . This asymmetric distribu - tion was similar among the different urban areas , though a greater dispersion was observed in the municipalities with larger populations ( Sevilla and less so Málaga and Córdoba ) ( Supplementary File 1 ) . After excluding 3 , 952 institutionalised cases ( 2 . 4 % ) , 16 , 547 cases without available geocoding ( 10 . 1 % ) and 1 , 859 cases geocoded outside the municipalities stud - ied ( 1 . 1 % ) , the number of confirmed cases of COVID - 19 analysed was 140 , 743 ( 86 . 3 % of the total confirmed cases reported to the SVEA ) , of which 12 , 585 were hospitalisations and 2 , 255 were deaths . Table 1 shows , for each urban area , the distribution of the census sections , the number of inhabitants , the AGI and con - firmed COVID - 19 cases ( infections , hospitalisations and deaths ) during the second time window studied . The confirmed cases of COVID - 19 that were declared in the first wave made up only 4 . 8 per cent of the total number of declared cases during the study period 20 . As mentioned in the methodology , we mainly report find - ings from the second and third waves ( the distribution of confirmed cases during the first wave and their rela - tive contribution to the overall study period is shown in Table 2 ) . COVID‑19 cases In the second and third waves , the urban areas with the greatest number of confirmed cases of COVID - 19 per 100 , 000 inhabitants were Granada ( 7072 . 6 ) and Alm - ería ( 5906 ) ; Huelva had the lowest number of cases ( 3535 . 3 ) . The distribution of the incidence of COVID - 19 by urban area is shown in Supplementary File 2 . The relationship between AGI and SIR at the case level varied by urban area ; however , it only reached statis - tical significance in the municipalities with a nega - tive association , that is to say , there was greater risk in the census sections with lower income ( Fig . 3 - A and Supplementary File 3 ) . These included Almería ( SRR = 0 . 84 , 95 % credibility interval [ CI ] = 0 . 75 – 0 . 94 ) , Granada ( SRR = 0 . 88 , 95 % CI = 0 . 78 – 1 . 00 ) and Sevilla ( SRR = 0 . 91 , 95 % CI 0 . 85 – 0 . 98 ) .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 2316 Hospitalised cases In the second and third waves , the number of con - firmed cases of COVID - 19 that were hospitalised per 100 , 000 inhabitants was homogeneous among the urban areas , except for Granada ( 608 . 6 ) , with an inci - dence much higher than the next highest ( Córdoba , with 370 . 5 ) . The association between AGI and the SIR of COVID - 19 in terms of hospitalisations was negative in all of the municipalities and reached statistical sig - nificance in all except Marbella and Jaén ( Fig . 3 - B and Supplementary File 3 ) . The municipalities in which a lower AGI at a census section level was associated with a greater relative risk of hospitalisation were Alge - ciras ( SRR = 0 . 41 , 95 % CI = 0 . 29 – 0 . 56 ) and Almería ( SRR = 0 . 54 , 95 % CI = 0 . 43 – 0 . 68 ) . Deaths In the second and third waves , the heterogeneity observed in the number of deaths due to COVID - 19 per 100 , 000 inhabitants was similar to what was described for the first wave . Granada ( 130 . 7 ) was again the municipality with the greatest number of deaths , followed by Algeciras ( 97 . 5 ) , while the munic - ipality with the lowest number of deaths was Huelva ( 38 . 9 ) . The association between AGI and the SIR of COVID - 19 in terms of deaths was negative in all of the urban areas and reached statistical significance in eight of the twelve ( Fig . 3 - C and Supplementary File 3 ) . The municipalities in which a lower AGI at a census section level was associated with a greater relative risk of death due to COVID - 19 were Dos Hermanas ( SRR = 0 . 35 , 95 % CI = 0 . 15 – 0 . 81 ) , Alge - ciras ( SRR = 0 . 38 , 95 % CI = 0 . 21 – 0 . 67 ) , and Málaga ( SRR = 0 . 42 , 95 % CI = 0 . 29 – 0 . 61 ) . Discussion This study suggests that infections , hospitalisations and deaths related to COVID - 19 were greater in underprivi - leged areas . This confirms what has been shown in prior studies both in Spain [ 10 , 24 ] and internationally [ 25 , 26 ] , though it provides some important nuances : the present study was carried out in an urban area , but the results are based on 12 urban areas ( rather than one ) with popula - tions between 100 , 000 and 600 , 000 inhabitants . Further - more , it is a simultaneous study of cases , hospitalisations and deaths . The association between low socioeconomic level and COVID - 19 exists , but it also seems that the magnitude tends to increase along with the severity of the disease . This study was based on the differences within vari - ous urban areas in which there were different socioeco - nomic levels , each one of which had results that were homogeneous , thus showing large income inequalities within each municipality ( but not between municipali - ties ) . The behaviour of the pandemic throughout the second and third waves was much less geographically heterogeneous than the first [ 14 ] . Although this study was of the 12 most populated cities in a Spanish region , it is still a region with 8 . 5 million people and a territo - rial extension larger than Ireland or Austria . This meant that in certain cities such as Granada , the number of cases , hospitalisation and deaths due to COVID - 19 was practically double that of Sevilla . These differences could be explained by city characteristics , such as population density , environmental and other climatic factors [ 24 , 27 , 28 ] . However , the fact that census sec - tions with lower income were hit hardest was a similar attribute among all of the areas studied .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 2316 death was observed for each decrease of one logarith - mic unit in annual AGI ( for example , the risk of death with a COVID - 19 diagnosis during the study period in a census section with an average AGI of 15 , 000 € was double that of a census section with 40 , 000 € ) . This inverse relationship between socioeconomic level and the entire cascade from COVID - infection to mortality had been pointed out previously in other high - income countries [ 25 , 29 , 30 ] . However , the present study shows a more pronounced relationship between lower level and greater severity of the disease . Referring to cases of infection , the areas with lower income were more affected . This has already been shown in terms of the confirmed cases in other Spanish cities such as Madrid [ 31 ] and Barcelona [ 7 , 10 ] and other areas such as New York [ 32 ] . Several reasons have been pointed out to explain the greater infection rate among lower income areas : living in smaller houses that do not allow for social distancing [ 17 ] ; difficulties of telework for less - qualified jobs [ 33 ] - and also along these lines , the eco - nomic component ; having lost a source of income would prompt households to search for other options [ 7 ] - ; and more challenges with the use of private transportation [ 34 ] . It has also been pointed out that the information on prevention measures has been received by the population in part based on their cultural level [ 35 ] , which , in devel - oped countries tends to be associated with income level . One of the most novel aspects of this research is the joint study , in a single population , not only of cases but also of hospitalisations and deaths . The explanations described prior for greater contagion of COVID ( crowd - ing , work instability , use of transport ) are not useful in the latter cases . The greater rates of hospitalisation and death depend on other mechanisms . There are at least two possible explanations related to this relationship . On the one hand , it could be that these rates were a direct reflection of poorer access to health services of those with low income [ 36 ] , especially primary care [ 37 ] . This could have delayed the early management of symp - toms and increased both the possibilities of hospitalisa - tions and of death . The problem of health access can be approached in two ways . One is “physical” in that greater problems contacting and attending health centres could be aggravated by the collateral impact of COVID - 19 on the whole system . The COVID - 19 crisis has changed the Spanish National Health System [ 38 ] . Operations were suspended , visits were delayed and accessing the system became more complicated . Second , there is also the issue of health culture or the health empowerment of citizens . Not everyone knows how to correctly interpret the signs of severity that should prompt them to seek health ser - vices nor how to provide informal home care . If to this we add the lack of knowledge of the disease , this could have been a notable barrier . During the crisis , it became clear that education should be improved in this sense . On the other hand , the greater impact on those with lower income could be explained , in addition to worse health access , by the life circumstances of these people . A lower socioeconomic level is related to worse health [ 39 ] . Also , pre - existing conditions prior to contract - ing COVID - 19 have been shown to be related to a more severe development of the disease [ 40 ] . Thus , if the characteristics of the environment are rel - evant in contracting COVID , the access to health services and prior levels of health determine the level of affecta - tion . This could explain why inequalities have been espe - cially evident in hospitalisations and deaths . We also cannot rule out that this finding could go beyond the ill - nesses related to COVID - 19 . Between the beginning of the pandemic and July of 2021 , Spain had excess mortal - ity of over 85 , 000 deaths [ 15 ] . We do not know how many are related to the collapse of the health system or whether this could have a greater impact on lower socioeconomic levels , but results such as these should inspire further investigation in this sense . What seems clear , according to this study , is that the pandemic has exacerbated exist - ing structural inequities , though not in a uniform way , over the past year and a half . In terms of study limitations , this is an ecological study , and the mechanisms underlying the associations between living in poor areas and incidence , hospitalisation and mortality during the COVID - 19 pandemic can only be hypothesised [ 22 ] . Secondly , this study excluded insti - tutionalised people . The reason for this was that it was impossible to link these individuals with their socioeco - nomic level based on their households , because in most cases the geocoding corresponded to the centre where they were institutionalised . As a result , the risk of infor - mation bias was reduced but this may have also caused a selection bias . Furthermore , the data related to the first wave were excluded from the analysis , which reduced the number of cases to study . However , this constitutes more a strength than a limitation , because given the biases in reporting of COVID - 19 cases during the first wave - men - tioned earlier - these data are unreliable and could com - promise the internal validity of the study . Thirdly , the AGI was taken from the most recent year available ( 2018 ) , so we might have overestimated its values ; this all the more applies to the census sections in which the AGI between 2015 and 2017 was used ( 0 . 7 % ) . However , compared to studies from other European countries , this potential bias might be mitigated by the social measures implemented by the Spanish government in 2020 , aimed at protect - ing individuals who became unemployed or partially employed . Fourthly , our results may be only generalisable to large urban areas from high - income countries which Page 9 of 10 Fernández‑Martínez et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 2316 adopted non - pharmaceutical interventions similar to those adopted in Spain . Finally , although the incidence rates were standardised by sex and age , the proportional - ity between the specific rates per subgroup in each cen - sus section with respect to the rest could not be verified , which may have led to a reduction in the accuracy of the relative risk [ 41 ] . Thus , the point estimates yielded by the statistical models should be interpreted with caution . This study also has strengths . The most important is that in a single study , low socioeconomic status was linked not only to COVID - infection , but also to hospi - talisations and deaths . This had not been done in Spain until now . Moreover , our study used more than one urban area and smaller geographical scale than previ - ous studies [ 22 , 31 ] . Conclusions Our results indicate the existence of income inequali - ties by geographical area in the incidence of cases , hos - pitalisations and deaths due to COVID - 19 , adjusted by age and sex . They suggest that a lower socioeconomic level is related not only to a greater risk of infection by COVID - 19 , but also greater related complications . Selective actions are needed to improve the population´s capacity to protect itself from infection and obtain conditions of equal access to health ser - vices . Such a need is not exclusive to COVID - 19 , as these results show inequalities that existed prior to the onset of the pandemic , which - if unaddressed - might persist and even become worse in the future .
