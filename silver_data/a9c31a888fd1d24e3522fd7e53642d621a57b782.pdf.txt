Dual color total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIR - FM ) is a powerful tool for decoding the molecular dynamics of clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . Typically , the recruitment of a fluorescent protein ( FP ) tagged endocytic protein was referenced to the disappearance of spot - like clathrin coated structure ( CCS ) , but the precision of spot - like CCS disappearance as a marker for canonical CME remained unknown . Here we have used a TIR - FM based imaging assay to detect scission events with a resolution of ~ 2s . We found scission events engulfed comparable amounts of transferrin receptor cargo at CCS of different sizes and CCS did not always disappear following scission . We measured the recruitment dynamics of 34 types of endocytic protein to scission events : Abp1 , ACK1 , amphiphysin1 , APPL1 , Arp3 , BIN1 , CALM , Cip4 , clathrin light chain ( Clc ) , cofilin , coronin1B , cortactin , dynamin1 & 2 , endophilin2 , Eps15 , Eps8 , Epsin2 , Fbp17 , FCHo1 & 2 , GAK , Hip1R , lifeAct , Mu2 subunit of the AP2 complex , myosin1E , myosinVI , NECAP , NWASP , OCRL1 , Rab5 , SNX9 , synaptojanin2 (cid:69) 1 and syndapin2 . For each protein we aligned ~ 1000 recruitment profiles to their respective scission events and constructed characteristic ‘recruitment signatures’ which were grouped , as for yeast , to reveal the modular organization of mammalian CME . A detailed analysis revealed the unanticipated recruitment dynamics of SNX9 , Fbp17 and Cip4 and showed the same set of proteins was recruited , in the same order , to scission events at CCS of different sizes and lifetimes . Collectively these data reveal the fine grained temporal structure of CME and suggest a simplified canonical model of mammalian CME in which the same 40doi : 10 . 1017 / S1431927611001073 Microsc .
