2358 T he pattern of local blood flow in the arterial tree affects the endothelial phenotype . Blood flow in the straight section of the arterial tree is atheroprotective , which exerts anti - inflammatory , antioxidative , and antiproliferative effects on vascular endothelial cells ( ECs ) . 1 – 3 AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) and sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 ) , activated by various metabolic and environmental stresses , are 2 key molecules in ECs regulated by atheroprotective flow . In vitro , pulsatile shear stress ( PS ) , mimicking atheroprotective flow , activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) through AMPK and SIRT1 . 4 Flow regulation of AMPK and SIRT1 in relation to the atheroprotective phenotype is evidenced in mice with ablated AMPK α 2 or SIRT1 . These mice , when crossed with ApoE – / – , have enhanced atherosclerosis both in atheroprone and athero - protective regions of the aorta . 5 AMPK and SIRT1 synergistically regulate common downstream targets , as exemplified by the coregulation of eNOS in ECs and peroxisome proliferator – acti - vated receptor - γ coactivator 1 α ( PGC1 α ) in myocytes . 4 , 6 Here , AMPK phosphorylation of eNOS and PGC1 α primes their deacetylation by SIRT1 .

Because cortactin has putative sites for AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) phosphorylation and sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 ) deacetylation , we examined the hypothesis that AMPK and SIRT1 coregulate cortactin dynamics in response to shear stress . Approach and Results —Analysis of the ability of AMPK to phosphorylate recombinant cortactin and oligopeptides whose sequences matched AMPK consensus sequences in cortactin pointed to Thr - 401 as the site of AMPK phosphorylation . Mass spectrometry confirmed Thr - 401 as the site of AMPK phosphorylation . Immunoblot analysis with AMPK siRNA and SIRT1 siRNA in human umbilical vein ECs and EC - specific AMPK α 2 knockout mice showed that AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin primes SIRT1 deacetylation in response to shear stress . Immunoblot analyses with cortactin siRNA in human umbilical vein ECs , phospho - deficient T401A and phospho - mimetic T401D mutant , or aceto - deficient ( 9K / R ) and aceto - mimetic ( 9K / Q ) showed that cortactin regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity . Confocal imaging and sucrose - density gradient analyses revealed that the phosphorylated / deacetylated cortactin translocates to the EC periphery facilitating endothelial nitric oxide synthase translocation from lipid to nonlipid raft domains . Knockdown of cortactin in vitro or genetic reduction of cortactin expression in vivo in mice substantially decreased the endothelial nitric oxide synthase – derived NO bioavailability . In vivo , atherosclerotic lesions increase in ApoE – / – / cortactin + / – mice , when compared with ApoE – / – / cortactin + / + littermates . Conclusions —AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin followed by SIRT1 deacetylation modulates the interaction of cortactin and cortical – actin in response to shear stress . Functionally , this AMPK / SIRT1 coregulated cortactin – F - actin dynamics is required for endothelial nitric oxide synthase subcellular translocation / activation and is atheroprotective .

In ECs , cortactin is functionally linked to cytoskeletal remodeling , angiogenesis , leukocyte transmigration , and vascular permeability . 10 – 13 In terms of post - translational modifications of cortactin , the Src family kinases FER and Syk phosphorylate cortactin at Tyr - 421 , Tyr - 466 , and Tyr - 482 . 14 – 17 PAK3 ( p21 - activated kinase 3 ) phosphory - lates Ser - 113 , and ERK ( extracellular signal – regulated kinases ) phosphorylates Ser - 405 and Ser - 418 . 18 – 20 Phosphorylation of these sites by either Tyr or Ser / Thr kinase is functionally linked to actin dynamics and assembly . Moreover , SIRT1 / 2 can interact with and deacetylate cortactin to affect its binding to F - actin . 21 Initial localization of eNOS in the lipid rafts of the EC mem - brane is essential for eNOS activation . On exposure to shear stress , eNOS translocates from caveolae to the cytoplasm , where eNOS is phosphorylated by Akt . 22 – 24 Reduction of eNOS in caveo - lae by cholesterol depletion or inhibition of eNOS myristoylation decreases stimulus - induced eNOS activation . 25 – 27 Much evidence indicates that the interaction of caveolae with actin - based cyto - skeleton and the dynamic remodeling of F - actin affect eNOS activity . 28 , 29 Indeed , both cytochalasin B disruption and phalloidin stabilization of F - actin diminish the flow - induced NO release in the rabbit abdominal aorta . 30 In addition , several actin - binding proteins , including dynamin - 2 , NOSIP ( nitric oxide synthase interacting protein ) , and NOSTRIN ( nitric oxide synthase traf - fic inducer ) are involved in eNOS trafficking and activity . 31 – 33 Although cortactin has been reported to translocate to the cell periphery on cortical – actin assembly in response to shear stress , 10 the involvement of cortactin in shear - stress – modulated eNOS and EC function is unknown . Cortactin has both AMPK phosphorylation and SIRT1 deacetylation consensus sequences . 21 , 34 , 35 This report examines the hypothesis that cortactin is coregulated by AMPK and SIRT1 similar to their regulation of eNOS and PGC1 α . We found that AMPK and SIRT1 not only coregulate cortactin but also play a key role in the structural and functional integrity of caveolae and are essential for shear - stress activation of eNOS . Hence , decreased expression of cortactin in the vascular wall hampers eNOS - derived NO bioavailability and increases atherosclerosis . Materials and Methods Materials and Methods are available in the online - only Data Supplement . Results AMPK Phosphorylates Cortactin Thr - 401 A genome - wide bioinformatics analysis for the consen - sus sequence of AMPK revealed that cortactin Ser - 348 and Thr - 401 located in the helix and proline - rich domains , respec - tively , could be AMPK phosphorylation sites ( Figure 1A ) . 36 Interestingly , these 2 sites are conserved among various mam - malian species ( Figure I in the online - only Data Supplement ) . Incubation of [ γ - 32 P ] ATP with recombinant cortactin and AMPK increased the level of 32 P - labeled cortactin ( Figure 1B ) , which suggested that AMPK can phosphorylate cortac - tin in vitro . To validate , AMPK can phosphorylate cortactin Ser - 348 and Thr - 401 , the degree of AMPK phosphorylation of 2 oligopeptides composed of the amino acids flanking Ser - 348 and Thr - 401 was compared with the SAMS ( substrate for AMP - activated protein kinase ) peptide , the canonical AMPK substrate , and peptides with Ala substituted at the putative sites of phosphorylation ( ie , S348A and T401A ) . We found that AMPK phosphorylated the 2 wild - type cortactin peptides to the same extent as the positive - control SAMS peptide . The Ala substitution of Thr - 401 , but not Ser - 348 , decreased 32 P incorporation to the level observed for samples without AMPK ( Figure 1C ) , which suggests that Thr - 401 could be an AMPK phosphorylation site . To determine further the site of AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin , we treated human umbilical vein ECs ( HUVECs ) with resveratrol , a polyphenol activat - ing / inducing AMPK and SIRT1 , or 5 - aminoimidazole - 4 - car - boxamide ribonucleotide , an AMPK activator . Cortactin was immunoprecipitated from the protein extracts and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis . By comparing the m / z values for the observed fragment ions with those calculated for the phosphorylated Thr - 401 – bearing tryptic peptide ( Table I in the online - only Data Supplement ) , mass spectrometry results indicated that Thr - 401 in cortactin was phosphorylated by AMPK in both resveratrol and 5 - aminoimidazole - 4 - car - boxamide ribonucleotide – treated ECs ( Figure 1D ; Figure II in the online - only Data Supplement ) . AMPK / SIRT1 Coregulates Cortactin Given that PS activates both AMPK and SIRT1 in ECs and SIRT1 deacetylates cortactin , 4 , 21 we examined whether cortac - tin can be coregulated by AMPK and SIRT1 in ECs respond - ing to PS . HUVECs were subjected to PS for various times followed by immunoprecipitation of cortactin and immunob - lotting for acetylated cortactin . Deacetylation of cortactin was evident as early as 4 hours , and the PS - reduced cortactin acet - ylation persisted for at least 16 hours ( Figure 2A ) . Knockdown of either AMPK or SIRT1 by siRNA blocked PS - reduced cor - tactin acetylation ( Figure 2B ) . Similar to PS , resveratrol treat - ment decreased cortactin acetylation in HUVECs ( Figure 2C ) . Knockdown of AMPK or SIRT1 also blocked the resveratrol - reduced cortactin acetylation ( Figure 2C ) . To further inves - tigate the AMPK / SIRT1 coregulation of cortactin , HUVECs were treated with nicotinamide , an SIRT1 - specific inhibitor before PS stimulation . Deacetylation of cortactin occurred at 4 hours under PS . However , cortactin remained acetylated if HUVECs were pretreated with nicotinamide ( Figure 2D ) . Moreover , the PS - reduced cortactin acetylation was not observed in lung ECs isolated from EC - specific AMPK α2 – / – mice ( Figure 2E ) . Next , we mutated cortactin Thr - 401 to Ala ( T401A ) or Asp ( T401D ) , the respective phospho - deficient and phospho - mimetic mutants .

Together , the results in Figure 2 suggest that AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin Thr - 401 primes cortactin deacetylation by SIRT1 . Cortactin Regulates eNOS Activity Because AMPK and SIRT1 coregulate cortactin at the post - translational level and because shear stress is a physiologi - cal stimulation regulating eNOS , we next investigated the involvement of cortactin in PS - activated eNOS . PS increased eNOS phosphorylation at Ser - 633 and Ser - 1177 ( Figure 3A ) , which is indicative of increased eNOS activity . This increased phosphorylation was attenuated by cortactin knockdown , which suggests that PS induction of eNOS is cortactin depen - dent . Next , we examined whether cortactin - dependent eNOS activation is regulated through AMPK and SIRT1 . HUVECs were transfected with cortactin phospho - deficient T401A or phospho - mimic T401D mutants and then infected with adenovirus overexpressing SIRT1 ( Ad - SIRT1 ) to mimic PS induction of SIRT1 . Overexpression of SIRT1 increased NO production in cells expressing cortactin T401D , but not in cells transfected with cortactin T401A ( Figure 3B ) . To further demonstrate that eNOS activity was modulated by cortactin in an AMPK / SIRT1 - dependent manner , we overexpressed eNOS with the cortactin T401A or T401D mutant in cortac - tin + / – murine embryonic fibroblasts and infected adenovirus overexpressing SIRT1 to simulate PS activation of AMPK / SIRT1 . Cells transfected with cortactin T401D and infected with Ad - SIRT1 showed higher eNOS activity , as indicated by an increase of phosphorylation at eNOS Ser - 633 ( Figure 3C ) . Likewise , overexpression of constitutively active AMPK ( Ad - AMPK - CA ) increased NO production in HUVECs trans - fected with aceto - deficient mutants ( cortactin 9K / R ) , but not with aceto - mimetic mutants ( cortactin 9K / Q ; Figure 3D ) . Furthermore , cortactin + / – murine embryonic fibroblasts over - expressing cortactin 9K / R infected with Ad - AMPK - CA showed increased eNOS phosphorylation . In contrast , murine embryonic fibroblasts overexpressing cortactin 9K / Q mutants did not respond to Ad - AMPK - CA transfection ( Figure 3E ) . To further delineate the role of AMPK / SIRT1 in activating eNOS via cortactin , we cotransfected cortactin T401D / 9K / R ( phos - pho - mimetic / aceto - deficient mutant ) or cortactin T401A / 9K / Q A B D C Figure 1 .

Cells overexpressing cortactin T401D / 9K / R showed increased eNOS phosphorylation and NO production ( Figure 3F and 3G ) , which further confirms that phosphory - lated / deacetylated cortactin modulates eNOS activity . AMPK / SIRT1 - Cortactin Regulation of eNOS Trafficking Because the integrity of actin cytoskeletal is required for shear stress – activated eNOS and deacetylated cortactin increases its interaction with F - actin , 34 we next examined the impact of AMPK / SIRT1 on the cortactin – actin association in relation to eNOS translocation and activity . We first knocked down AMPK or SIRT1 with siRNA and then examined the cortical – actin association under PS . The association of cortactin and F - actin was indicated by the degree of colocalization observed by using double immunofluorescent staining . Confocal microscopy showed that PS enhanced the cortactin interac - tion with cortical – actin , and siRNA knockdown of AMPK or SIRT1 inhibited this interaction ( Figure 4A ) . Cortical – actin is important for the formation and func - tion of caveolae . 37 , 38 eNOS activation by shear stress requires eNOS translocation from caveolae to the cytoplasm , and dis - ruption of F - actin or lipid rafts blunts shear stress activation of eNOS . 27 , 39 Because AMPK / SIRT1 coregulated cortactin is functionally related to eNOS activity ( demonstrated in Figure 3 ) , we next investigated the role of cortactin – actin assembly in eNOS trafficking in response to PS . Sucrose - density gradient analysis showed that under static condi - tions , eNOS , cortactin , actin , and caveolin - 1 ( a caveolae marker ) are distributed in both lipid raft and nonlipid raft fractions ( Figure 4B ) . PS shifted eNOS , cortactin , actin , and caveolin - 1 from lipid raft to nonlipid raft fractions . Of note , cortactin siRNA knockdown stimulated eNOS , actin , and caveolin - 1 to localize to the nonlipid raft fractions regardless of static or PS conditions ( Figure 4B and 4C ) . Translocation of eNOS , actin , and caveolin - 1 out of the lipid rafts was also observed in ECs treated with cytochalasin D ( Figure III in the online - only Data Supplement ) , which disrupts F - actin – based cytoskeleton and in cells with AMPK or SIRT1 knocked down ( Figure IV in the online - only Data Supplement ) . In addition , cortactin - dependent eNOS compartmentalization was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy . Under static conditions , eNOS and flotillin 2 ( a lipid raft marker ) , as well as eNOS and caveolin - 1 , colocalized ( Figure 4D ) , which indicates that a significant portion of eNOS in ECs was in lipid rafts . Under PS , eNOS was largely dissociated from lipid rafts . Cortactin knockdown shifted eNOS out of lipid rafts both under static conditions and PS . To further assess A D B E F C Figure 2 . AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) phosphorylation of cortactin ( CTTN ) primes sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 ) deacetylation .

C , AMPK and SIRT1 were activated with resveratrol ( RSV ) for 4 h . D , HUVECs were treated with nicotinamide ( NAM , 5 mmol / L ) to inhibit SIRT1 activity . E , Lung endothelial cells ( ECs ) isolated from EC - specific AMPK α 2 knockout mice ( AMPK α 2 – / – ) , and their wild - type ( WT ) lit - termates ( AMPK α 2 + / + ) were kept under static conditions or subjected to PS for 4 h . F , CTTN + / – murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were transfected with Flag - tagged CTTN phospho - deficient ( T401A ) , or phospho - mimic ( T401D ) expression plasmid .

Importantly , cortactin knockdown abrogated eNOS translocation and activation in response to PS stimuli ( Figure 4E ) . Cortactin - Dependent eNOS Activation in the Vascular Wall Because the systemic knockout of cortactin is embryonic lethal , 40 we used cortactin + / – mice and their cortactin + / + lit - termates to study the role of AMPK / SIRT1 coregulation of cortactin in the vascular wall . One possible mechanism for cortactin regulation of eNOS trafficking is that cortactin is required for caveolae formation . To test this hypothesis , we compared endothelial caveolae in cortactin + / + with that in cortactin + / – mice . Electron micrographs shown in Figure 5A reveal that endothelium from the wild - type animals had ≈ 2±0 . 2 per micrometer caveolae in both apical and basolat - eral membranes . However , the amount of caveolae was greatly reduced in the cortactin + / – endothelium ( 1±0 . 1 per micrometer in apical and 1 . 5±0 . 1 per micrometer in basolateral mem - branes ) . Cortactin , F - actin , and eNOS subcellular location in the vascular wall were compared by en face staining of endothelium in aortas from cortactin + / + and cortactin + / – mice . Thoracic aorta of cortactin + / + mice showed cortactin , F - actin , and eNOS colocalization at cell – cell junctions of endothelium but to a much lesser extent in corresponding regions of cortac - tin + / – mice ( Figure 5B ) . Immunoblotting with phospho - eNOS and cortactin antibodies showed decreased eNOS phosphory - lation in cortactin + / – aortas ( Figure 5C ) . The decreased eNOS phosphorylation in cortactin + / – mice was associated with both impaired NO production ( Figure 5D ) and flow - induced vessel dilation ( Figure 5E ) . A B C E F G D Figure 3 .

This difference was mainly found in the intima ( endothelium ) but not in media and adventitia ( Figure 6B ) . To determine whether the endothelial dysfunction in cortactin + / – mice were atherogenic , we intro - duced an ApoE – / – background into cortactin + / – mice to gen - erate ApoE – / – / cortactin + / – mice and their ApoE – / – / cortactin + / + littermates . The 2 groups were fed an atherogenic diet for 10 weeks , and atherosclerotic lesions in aortas were quantified and compared . The mean lesion area in thoracic aortas was ≈ 1 . 5 - fold larger for ApoE – / – / cortactin + / – than for ApoE – / – / cor - tactin + / + mice ( 6 . 5±1 . 7 % versus 3 . 0±0 . 4 % ; Figure 6C and 6D ) . In addition , the aortic arch lesion area and total lesion area ( the sum of aortic arch , thoracic aorta , and abdominal aorta ) were larger in the ApoE – / – / cortactin + / – than in the ApoE – / – / cor - tactin + / + mice ( 46 . 4±4 . 5 % versus 24 . 4±3 . 2 % and 13 . 6±5 . 3 % versus 9 . 3±3 . 5 % ; Figure 6C , 6E , and 6F ) . Because the serum lipid profiles and M1 and M2 polarization in the isolated macrophages from the 2 groups of animals were comparable ( Table II and Figure V in the online - only Data Supplement ) , increased lesion sizes in the ApoE – / – / cortactin + / – mice should not have resulted from variations in lipoprotein metabolic or monocyte / macrophage phenotypic changes . Rather , hap - loid expression of cortactin in endothelium accounted for the increased atherosclerosis in ApoE – / – / cortactin + / – mice . A B C E D Figure 4 .

Straight segments of the arterial tree are largely athero - resistant , in part , via laminar flow - activated AMPK and SIRT1 . 4 , 5 We and oth - ers showed that AMPK and SIRT1 activate eNOS via post - translational mechanisms in ECs in response to shear stress . Shear - stress activation of eNOS may rely on the integrity of actin - based cytoskeleton , 30 , 41 , 42 which suggests an F - actin – related mechanism as a prerequisite for AMPK / SIRT1 phos - phorylation / deacetylation of eNOS . In this report , we show that AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin followed by SIRT1 deacetylation modulates the interaction of cortactin and cor - tical – actin . In terms of function , this AMPK / SIRT1 coregu - lated cortactin – F - actin dynamics directs eNOS subcellular translocation and activation . The AMPK phosphorylation site Thr - 401 is located in the proline - rich domain ( residues 327 – 494 ) of cortactin and harbors several Tyr and Ser / Thr phosphorylation sites . The phosphorylation of Tyr - 421 , Tyr - 466 , and Tyr - 482 by Src kinase regulates actin assembly by modulating cortac - tin binding to neuronal WASP , MLCK ( myosin light - chain kinase ) , and dynamin - 2 . 43 – 45 ERK phosphorylation of Ser - 405 and Ser - 418 initiates actin - related protein 2 / 3 – depen - dent actin nucleation via neuronal WASP . 20 In addition , recent phosphoproteomic analysis indicates that Akt phos - phorylates Thr - 401 . 46 This phosphorylation event is involved in migration and invasion of the breast cancer cell line MCF - 10A . Ser / Thr versus Tyr phosphorylation of cortactin may differentially affect actin assembly because Ser / Thr phos - phorylation affects actin polymerization , whereas Tyr phos - phorylation regulates focal adhesion turnover . 47 In addition , because Tyr phosphorylation alone is insufficient for subcel - lular translocation of cortactin responding to shear stress or a receptor agonist , 10 , 48 the interplay of AMPK / SIRT1 on cor - tactin – actin assembly would be functionally different from Src tyrosine regulation . Indeed , AMPK or SIRT1 knockdown has little effect on shear - stress – induced stress fiber forma - tion and alignment ( Figure 4A ) . This result further suggests that although AMPK / SIRT1 coregulation of cortactin – F - ac - tin dynamics is required for eNOS activation , this mode of regulation is not involved in the actin cytoskeletal remod - eling that would otherwise be regulated by ERK . 47 Here , 2 mechanisms are likely involved in AMPK / SIRT1 - induced cortactin – actin assembly . First , AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin proline - rich domain induces a conformational change of F - actin – binding repeats and thus favoring SIRT1 deacetylation to promote cortical – actin remodeling . AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin may also liberate Src homology 3 domains from intramolecular binding to the proline - rich domain . Second , SIRT1 deacetylation enables cortactin – cortical – actin assembly through the positively charged Lys patch ( Lys - 87 , Lys - 124 , Lys - 161 , Lys - 189 , Lys - 198 , Lys - 235 , Lys - 272 , Lys - 309 , and Lys - 319 ) . AMPK and SIRT1 also synergistically regulate eNOS and PGC1 α similar to that of A C D E B Figure 5 . Cortactin - dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) localization in the mouse aorta .

E , Flow - induced vasodilation ex vivo in cerebellar microvessels from cortactin + / + ( n = 5 ) and cortactin + / – ( n = 6 ) mice pretreated with phenylephrine ( 1 µ mol / L ) . The vessel dilation % is defined as the percentage of the diameter change of the flow - induced dilation compared with the diameter change of the phenylephrine - induced constriction . * P < 0 . 05 . by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 4 , 2017 h tt p : / / a t vb . a h a j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Shentu et al AMPK / SIRT1 Coregulation of Cortactin 2365 cortactin 4 , 6 However , knockdown of cortactin had little effect on PGC1 α expression in HUVECs ( Figure VI in the online - only Data Supplement ) , which suggests that cortactin is not an upstream regulator of PGC1 α . Thus , AMPK may phos - phorylate cortactin , eNOS , and PGC1 α , which primes for the deacetylation of these 3 molecules independently . The assembly of cortical – actin is required for the orga - nization and localization of caveolae near the plasma mem - brane . 49 Furthermore , F - actin association with membrane caveolae stabilizes caveolae structure and controls caveolae endocytosis . 29 , 50 – 52 Here , our results suggest that caveolae for - mation requires cortactin because cortactin knockdown shifts caveolin - 1 and actin to the nonlipid fractions ( Figure 4B ) . In vivo , the reduced level of caveolae in the vascular wall of cortactin + / – mice ( Figure 5A ) suggests that cortactin is an integral part of the F - actin apparatus required to main - tain caveolae in the vasculature . Knockdown of AMPK or SIRT1 abolishes cortactin – F - actin interaction and also shifts caveolin - 1 ( a caveolae marker ) to the nonlipid raft regions ( Figure 4 ; Figure IV in the online - only Data Supplement ) . Because cytochalasin D treatment displaces cortactin – actin , as well as caveolin - 1 , from the nonlipid raft regions ( Figure III in the online - only Data Supplement ) , caveolae formation in the lipid - rich domains may depend on AMPK / SIRT1 regulation of the cortactin – F - actin complex . A pos - sible mechanism is that AMPK phosphorylation followed by SIRT1 deacetylation enhances the interaction between the Lys - rich patch of cortactin with F - actin . Such an enhanced cortactin – F - actin interaction could lead to the translocation of the cortical – actin complex with caveolin - 1 and eNOS in the lipid raft . The AMPK / SIRT1 - dependent regulation of caveolae via cortactin – F - actin is required for eNOS activation . The pro - cess can be activated mechanically or pharmacologically ( ie , by PS or resveratrol ) , which suggests that cortactin – F - actin assembly is a common component for stimuli that increase eNOS - derived NO bioavailability . Much evidence demonstrates that eNOS trafficking from membrane caveo - lae to the cytoplasm is required for its activation , 25 , 27 , 38 , 53 but our data reveal that this subcellular localization and translocation of eNOS depends on AMPK / SIRT1 coregula - tion of cortactin . The most likely explanation for this is that eNOS translocation requires cortactin – F - actin in an AMPK / SIRT1 - dependent manner . This postulation is supported by observations that cortactin T401D / 9K / R ( a gain - of - function mutant ) is associated with higher levels of NO ( Figure 3F and 3G ) and that F - actin disruption or caveolae diminish - ment impairs eNOS activity . 26 , 27 , 30 At the tissue level , metfor - min administration increased the eNOS translocation to the nonlipid raft in mouse ECs ( Figure VIIA in the online - only Data Supplement ) . Furthermore , caveolin - 1 dissociated with eNOS in response to metformin treatment demonstrated by A B C D E F Figure 6 .

In relation to atherosclerosis , AMPK / SIRT1 coregulation of cortactin – F - actin affects endothelial function preceding atherosclerosis , which would be , in part , because of impaired eNOS activity . The consistent increase in atherosclerosis in the thoracic aorta of ApoE – / – / cortactin + / – ( Figure 6 ) , ApoE – / – / AMPK α 2 – / – , and ApoE – / – / EC - SIRT1 – / – mice suggests that the flow - regulated cortactin – F - actin is associated with AMPK and SIRT1 activity . 5 Besides cortac - tin , cortical – actin complexes contain actin - related protein 2 / 3 , neuronal WASP / WAVE , and dynamin - 2 . Whether these proteins affect ECs in the same manner as cortactin warrants further study . Although vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) in the vasculature are not in direct contact with blood flow , the AMPK / SIRT1 - cortactin signaling seems to be functional in VSMCs in 2 ways . First , AMPK / SIRT1 - cortactin may posi - tively regulate the redox state of VSMCs because AMPK α 2 or cortactin knockdown results in an increased ROS level and NOX4 expression with concurrent decrease in SOD1 expres - sion ( Figure VIII in the online - only Data Supplement ) . If so , the beneficial effect of AMPK and SIRT1 in VSMCs would be , in part , mediated through cortactin . 54 , 55 Second , AMPK / SIRT1 - cortactin signaling in ECs seems to affect the homeo - stasis of VSMCs . Supporting this postulation , ECs treated with metformin or EC transfected with T401D are associ - ated with an increased cGMP level in the conditioned media ( Figure IXB in the online - only Data Supplement ) , as well as a decreased ROS level in the cocultured VSMCs ( Figure IXC in the online - only Data Supplement ) . What appears to argue against the above conclusions is that endothelial - specific overexpression of caveolin - 1 with an attendant increase in caveolae is atherogenic , and caveolin - 1 knockout in the ApoE - null background decreases atheroscle - rosis . 56 – 58 However , endothelium from caveolin – / – mice have higher levels of NO , which is usually predictive of athero - protection . 58 , 59 Thus , caveolae abundance resulting from gene manipulations is not predictive of atherogenesis . Caveolae are signaling hubs harboring an array of both pro - and anti - inflammatory molecules . The dynamic interactions of these caveolae - associated molecules with the cortical – actin com - plex that includes cortactin may be more important for modu - lation of the endothelial phenotype than level of caveolin - 1 . As discussed above , cortactin + / – mice with decreased levels of caveolae ( Figure 5A ) exhibit a proinflammatory and dys - functional endothelial phenotype . In contrast , eNOS activity is reduced and the flow - induced dilation is impaired in vessels from cortactin + / – mice ( Figure 5C through 5E ) . Furthermore , ApoE – / – / cortactin + / – mice show increased atherosclerosis ( Figure 6C ) . Because atheroprotective flow - activated AMPK and SIRT1 can directly modulate eNOS activity via post - translational modifications , 4 , 5 our findings provide added complexity to AMPK / SIRT1 regulation of eNOS that involves cortactin – F - actin dynamics . Previous studies demonstrate that the cortactin - depen - dent pathways are activated by sphingosine 1 - phosphate and that sphingosine 1 - phosphate is associated with high - density lipoprotein . 48 , 60 – 62 Related to these findings , it was indicated that synthetic sphingosine 1 - phosphate analogs ameliorate atherosclerosis . 63 , 64 The clinical implication of the current study , together with those previous , is that the atheroprotective effect exerted by AMPK / SIRT1 and sphin - gosine 1 - phosphate signaling maybe mediated through cortactin .

MEFs and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS . For shear stress experiments , the flow rate was 12 dyne / cm 2 . The oscillatory stimulator was connected to the circulating system to generate a magnitude of 4 dyne / cm 2 with oscillation at 1 Hz . Antibodies and reagents The antibodies used were anti - cortactin and anti - acetyl - cortactin ( Millipore ) ; anti - pan - AMPK , anti - phospho - AMPK Thr - 172 , and anti - eNOS ( Cell Signaling Technology ) ; anti - phospho - eNOS 633 / 635 , 1177 / 1179 and anti - flot - 2 ( BD Transduction Laboratory ) . Decetylation - deficient mimic ( 9KQ ) and deacetylation mimic ( 9KR ) mutants were described . 1 Rhodamine phalloidin was purchased from Cytoskeleton , Inc . Site - direct mutagenesis was used to generate phospho - deficient cortactin T401A and phospho - mimic T401D , T401A / 9K / Q , and T401D / 9K / R mutants . Recombinant adenovirus ( Ad ) - AMPK - CA and Ad - SIRT1 expressing a constitutively active form of AMPK  2 and full - length SIRT1 were described previously . 2 In vitro kinase assay AMPK kinase assays were conducted in 50  l reaction buffer containing 50 mM Hepes , 0 . 38 mM AMP , 0 . 38 mM ATP , 9 mM MgCl 2 , 11 pM AMPKα , and 2  g of recombinant cortactin at 37 °C for 1 hr . Reaction mixtures were then resolved by SDS - PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining or autoradiography . Identical reaction conditions were used for assays with synthetic peptides as substrates . Radioactivity of the peptide substrates was determined by a standard protocol . Nano - LC - MS / MS tandem mass spectrometry Kinase reaction mixtures were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE . The bands containing cortactin were excised and proteins were reduced in - gel , alkylated with iodoacetamide , and digested with trypsin at 37°C . Peptides were extracted with 5 % acetic acid in H 2 O , then 5 % acetic acid in CH 3 CN / H 2 O ( 1 : 1 , vol / vol ) . Online LC - MS / MS analysis was performed with an LTQ - Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer coupled with an EASY n - LCII HPLC system and a nanoelectrospray ionization source for peptide sequencing and phosphorylation identification . The LC - MS / MS data were analyzed by Mascot Server 2 . 2 ( Matrix Science ) for the mass - to - charge ( m / z ) ratio data files against the National Center for Biotechnology Information database . siRNA knockdown and transient transfection Transient transfection of siRNA involved use of lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) . HUVECs at 70 % confluence were transfected with AMPK  1 and AMPK  2 siRNA ( 10 nM , Qiagen SI02622235 and SI02758595 ) , SIRT1 siRNA ( 20 nM , Qiagen , SI00098434 ) , cortactin siRNA ( 20 nM , Qiagen SI02661960 ) , or scramble RNA ( 20 nM ) in Opti - MEM ( Gibco ) . HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of respective DNA plasmid with 2 μL Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) per 10 6 cells . At 24 hr after transfection , cells were infected with Ad - AMPK or Ad - SIRT1 for another 48 hr before use . Immunoblotting , immunoprecipitation , NO bioavailability , and RT - qPCR Cell lysates or mouse aortic extracts were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE . Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed with standard methods . NO production was assessed as the accumulated nitrite ( NO 2 - ) in cell culture media by nitrite / nitrate fluorometric assay ( Cayman Chemicals ) or Griess reagent ( Sigma ) . Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Reverse transcription involved use of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . RT - qPCR involved iQ SYBR Green supermix ( Bio - Rad ) on the iCycler real - time PCR detection system ( Bio - Rad ) ; primers are listed in Supplemental Table 3 . Lipid raft isolation and analysis Cells were lysed and the homogenate was mixed with an equal volume ( 1 ml ) of MES - buffered saline ( 25 mM MES , pH 6 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 500 mM Na 2 CO 3 ) containing 80 % sucrose . A volume of 6 ml of MES - buffered saline containing 30 % sucrose was layered on top , then 4 ml MES - buffered saline containing 5 % sucrose . Gradients were centrifuged for 16 hr at 30 , 000 rpm in an SW41 rotor . Tubes were fractionated into twelve 1 ml fractions . Immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy ECs were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4°C and subjected to permeabilization . Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 1 % ) was added to PBS to permeate the cell membrane at 4 °C for 10 min . For en face staining , mouse aortas were perfused , isolated , and fixed . After blocking in 2 . 5 % BSA for 20 min , then primary antibody for 1 hr , specimens were incubated for 2 hr with Alex - 488 ( anti - mouse ) - or Alex - 568 ( anti - rabbit ) - conjugated secondary antibody . Rhodamine phalloidin was used to stain F - actin . An Olympus FV100 confocal microscope was used to acquire the fluorescent images . Flow - induced vessel dilation and assessment of atherosclerosis The animal protocols were approved by University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . ApoE - / - mice ( B6 . 129P2 - Apoe tm1Unc / J , stock number 002052 ) were from the Jackson Laboratory . The cortactin + / - mouse line ( in C57BL / 6j background ) was obtained from Dr . Steven Dudek ( University of Illinois , Chicago ) . 3 For the flow - induced vessel dilation experiment , 8 - to 10 - week - old male cortactin + / - mice and their cortactin + / + littermates were used to evaluate the flow - induced vasodilation as described . 4 Cerebellar microvessels were dissected and cannulated with the perfusion chamber connected to the SoftEdge Acquisition Subsystem ( Living Systems , Burlington , VT ) . The vessels were perfused with a buffer containing 130 mM NaCl , 10 mM HEPES , 6 mM glucose , 4 mM KCl , 4 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 1 . 18 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1 . 2 mM MgSO 4 and 0 . 025 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 . Phenylephrine ( 1  M ) was used to obtain maximal vasoconstriction , followed by flow perfusion at 400  l / min . The external diameter of the vessels was monitored and recorded as percentage of vasodilation . For atherosclerosis experiments , ApoE - / - mice were bred with a cortactin + / - line to generate cortactin + / - mice with an ApoE - null background . Eight - week - old male ApoE - / - / cortactin + / + mice and their ApoE - / - / cortactin + / - littermates were fed a high - fat , high - cholesterol Paigen diet containing 15 % fat , 1 . 25 % cholesterol , and 0 . 5 % sodium cholate ( Harlan Teklad ) ad libitum for 10 weeks . Animals were then killed and aortas isolated . Aortic specimens were stained with Oil - red O to assess lesion severity and distribution . Transmission electron microscopy Mice were scarified and perfused through the left ventricle with PBS followed by fixative ( 2 % paraformaldehyde , 2 % glutaraldehyde in PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) . The aortas were isolated and kept in fixative overnight . Samples were then washed 3 times with 0 . 15 M sodium cacodylate buffer and fixed with 2 % OsO 4 followed by 0 . 8 % potassium ferrocyanide in 0 . 15 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 hr . The specimens were stained overnight in 2 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated , and embedded into Durcupan resin . Ultra - thin sections ( 60 - 70 nm ) were stained with 2 % uranyl acetate and statured lead citrate solution , and examined under a JEOL - 1200EX transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV . TEM was performed at the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research , University of California , San Diego . Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± SEM ( n = 3 unless otherwise noted ) . For parametric data that were normally distributed , Student t test was used to analyze differences among groups . For nonparametric data , the Mann - Whitney U test with the exact method was used to analyze differences between 2 groups . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . References 1 .
