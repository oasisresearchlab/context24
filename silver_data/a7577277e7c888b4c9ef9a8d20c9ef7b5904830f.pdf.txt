Talins control the activation state of inte - grins , link integrins to cytoskeletal actin , recruit numerous signalling molecules that mediate integrin signalling and coordinate recruitment of microtubules to adhesion sites via interaction with KANK ( kidney ankyrin repeat - containing ) proteins . Vertebrates have two talin genes , TLN1 and TLN2 . Although talin1 and talin2 share 76 % protein sequence identity ( 88 % similarity ) , they are not functionally redundant , and the differences between the two isoforms are not fully understood . In this Review , we focus on the similarities and differences between the two talins in terms of structure , biochemistry and function , which hint at subtle differences in ﬁne - tuning adhesion signalling . Keywords : integrin ; mechanobiology ; talin Integrin adhesions : linking the cell to the extracellular matrix Integrin - mediated adhesions to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) are found in nearly all cell types and mediate a diverse range of functions . There are 24 ab heterodimeric integrins , which show distinct patterns of cell - type and tissue - speciﬁc expression , and support dif - ferent forms of cell - ECM and cell - cell attachment . Inte - grins connect to the ECM via their large extracellular domains but , in contrast , the cytoplasmic domains , the ‘integrin tails’ , are generally short ( ~ 40 – 60 amino acids ) . Despite this diminutive size , large multiprotein complexes assemble on the cytoplasmic face of integrins , providing linkages to the cell cytoskeleton and to numerous intracellular signalling pathways . The complexity of cell - matrix adhesions has been highlighted by the analysis of the ‘integrin adhesome’ using mass spectrometry on multiple integrin adhesion complexes . This identiﬁed a network of > 240 proteins [ 1 , 2 ] , and additional adhesome proteins are constantly being discovered , many of which are cytoplasmic components that couple adhesions to numerous sig - nalling cascades . These enable diverse intracellular responses , a process often referred to as ‘outside - in’ signalling . These signalling hubs regulate a multitude of cellular processes including cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility , cell growth , survival and the cellular response to the local environment . Unsurprisingly , numerous diseases arise from the defects in compo - nents of the integrin adhesome [ 3 ] . Further analysis of integrin adhesome datasets collected under different conditions has revealed the dynamic nature of these complexes , and the functional diversity that can derive from the same building blocks . What emerges is a con - sensus adhesome of ~ 60 proteins centred around four axes comprising ; ILK - PINCH - kindlin , FAK - paxillin , talin - vinculin and a - actinin - zyxin - VASP , although it seems likely that all of these axes are linked to talin in some way . As well as 24 different integrins , vertebrates also have two major talin isoforms : talin1 and talin2 . Most of the attention on talin has focused on talin1 , primarily due to its essential role in mediating cell Abbreviations ABS , actin - binding site ; DD , dimerisation domain ; ECM , extracellular matrix ; FA , focal adhesion ; FERM , 4 . 1 protein , ezrin , radixin , moesin ; IBS , integrin - binding site ; IF , intermediate ﬁlament ; PTM , post - translational modiﬁcation ; VBS , vinculin - binding site . 2108 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License , which permits use , distribution and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited . adhesion as shown by studies on talin1 knockout [ 4 ] and talin1 - depleted cells [ 5 – 7 ] . Talin1 knockout is also embryonic lethal in mice due to arrested gastrulation , indicating a key role in early development [ 4 ] . In con - trast talin2 , which was only discovered following pub - lication of the human genome sequence [ 8 , 9 ] has received less attention , and the fact that talin2 knock - out mice are viable and fertile [ 10 ] suggests isoform redundancy . However , talin2 knockout mice display a mild dystrophic phenotype and the variability in the number of pups surviving to adulthood suggest under - lying defects [ 10 ] . Therefore , it appears that talin2 plays important roles in development although many of its functions can be compensated for by talin1 . This Review aims to summarise what is currently known about the structural , biochemical and func - tional differences between the two talin isoforms . Evo - lutionary genomics has been used to study talin isoforms in the past , and here , we combine genetic analysis with the recent wealth of structural informa - tion to highlight the emerging functions of the two tal - ins as signalling platforms . Integrin – talin – actin : the core of cell - matrix adhesions Strikingly , despite the structural complexity of cell - ECM adhesions , the majority of these dynamic adhe - sion complexes comprise a simple and robust core of three proteins : talin which binds to and activates inte - grins and couples them to the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 1 ) . All of the other components can be assembled on to this framework to give rise to various types of adhesive structures . Once formed , the protein vinculin is recruited to the complex to stabilise the connection to actin , a process which is regulated by an elegant feedback mechanism . Thus , vinculin is only recruited when talin experiences mechanical force , and force will only be exerted when talin is successfully bound to an integrin and coupled to actin . If these conditions are not met , then nascent adhesions will not experience sufﬁcient force to recruit vinculin and will disassemble . However , once vinculin is recruited to nascent adhe - sions , it crosslinks talin to actin , and the core , linkages are stabilised . How such complexes mature depends on multiple variables including cell type , ECM composi - tion , matrix stiffness , integrin subtype , mechanical sig - nals , etc . This leads to the development of a variety of adhesion complexes including nascent adhesions , focal adhesions ( FAs ) , ﬁbrillar adhesions , podosomes , invadopodia , etc . , all of which have at their core the same integrin – talin – actin connection . In their recent Review , Klapholz and Brown eloquently describe the myriad of different roles that talin plays in adhesion , and provocatively call talin ‘the master of integrin adhesions’ , a view we share [ 11 ] . The talins Talin is a large 270 kDa actin - binding protein that was ﬁrst discovered in 1983 as a component of FAs and ruf - ﬂing membranes [ 12 ] . Talin comprises an N - terminal FERM domain ( the head ) coupled to a ﬂexible talin rod . Since then , it has been shown to be a key compo - nent of integrin adhesions with roles in integrin activa - tion [ 13 ] , the molecular clutch that couples integrins to cytoskeletal actin [ 14 ] , FA assembly and the recruitment of numerous signalling molecules [ 15 ] . Talins also inter - act with the KANK family of adapter proteins [ 16 , 17 ] which target microtubules to adhesion sites , stimulating FA turnover [ 18 ] . As well as transmitting forces between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton , the length of talin has been shown to deﬁne the geometry of the adhesion [ 19 ] , and talin plays a key role as a mechanosensitive adapter , undergoing force - dependent conformational transitions in its 13 rod domains [ 20 – 24 ] that modulate binding interactions with mechanosensitive ligands . Given the above , it is unsurprising that talin1 knockout in mice is embryonic lethal [ 4 , 25 ] . Fig . 1 . Talin at the core of the adhesion . A cartoon of the core of integrin adhesions , highlighting talins central role . Talin coordinates both the actin cytoskeleton , and through the interaction with KANK proteins , the microtubule cytoskeleton at adhesion sites . Once the adhesion core is assembled , talin serves as a scaffold to recruit many other proteins in order to form all the many different types of adhesive structures ( focal adhesions , podosomes , invadopodia , etc . ) . 2109 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies R . E . Gough and B . T . Goult Tale of two talins Tissue expression and cellular localisation vary con - siderably between the two isoforms ; talin1 is expressed in all tissues . In contrast , talin2 expression is more variable , and it is absent entirely from some cell types , for example , no talin2 is present in endothelial cells possibly via silencing of the Tln2 gene by promoter methylation [ 26 , 27 ] . The Human Protein Atlas [ 28 ] shows the near ubiquitous expression of talin1 in all cell types in all tissues , whereas the high levels of tal - in2 are found mainly in the brain , particularly the cerebral cortex , heart muscle and the kidney . There is clear interplay in the expression of the two talin isoforms , although the mechanism for this is not known . Talin2 expression is rapidly upregulated fol - lowing knockout of talin1 , both transiently [ 26 ] and also in Tln1 - knockout mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts [ 7 ] leading to rescue of many of the consequences of the loss of talin1 . However , knockout of both talin iso - forms completely ablates cell - ECM adhesion [ 5 ] , con - ﬁrming the essential role of talins in integrin biology . In ﬁbroblasts , both talins localise to FAs , and talin1 is recruited directly to the leading edge , via proteins like the Rap1 effector RIAM ( Rap1 - interacting adap - ter molecule ) [ 29 , 30 ] and FAK ( focal adhesion kinase ) [ 31 ] . In contrast , less is known about talin2 recruit - ment . Although talin2 binds to RIAM , talin2 - speciﬁc antibodies reveal that talin2 forms diffuse aggregates throughout the cell , which overtime coalesce to form larger complexes , either at focal or ﬁbrillar adhesion sites [ 25 ] . For the most part , only talin2 is found at ﬁbrillar adhesions in the centre of the cell [ 25 ] . This localisation positions talin2 at sites of ﬁbronectin secretion and assembly [ 32 ] and also to formation of invadopodia [ 33 ] . Although much less is known about the role of talin2 , it has recently been the subject of increased interest and isoform - speciﬁc functionalities have been reported . For example , talin2 has been reported to be indispensable for the generation of trac - tion force and invadopodium - mediated matrix degra - dation required for invadopodia formation [ 33 ] . Furthermore , talin2 has been shown to be able to recruit vinculin in the absence of mechanical force sug - gesting different mechanical properties [ 34 ] . In sum - mary , the relative roles of talin1 and talin2 remain to be fully elucidated . Structure of talin 1 and 2 Gene structure and splice variation in talins The two talins are encoded by separate genes , Tln1 and Tln2 , which have conserved intron – exon bound - aries [ 9 , 35 ] . However , whereas talin1 has relatively small introns resulting in a gene of ~ 30 kb , talin2 is much bigger ( ~ 190 kb ) , due to the presence of much larger introns . Moreover , initial studies suggest that multiple talin2 isoforms are generated via differential splicing [ 36 ] . While the function of these isoforms is currently unknown , the expression pattern of each is distinct . Testes , kidney and brain express short C - terminal proteins lacking the FERM domain [ 36 ] rais - ing the possibility that such variants might function independent of integrins , although they do contain the integrin - binding site located in the rod domain . Intriguingly , expression of a C - terminal talin1 frag - ment resembling the testes - speciﬁc talin2 isoform was sufﬁcient to rescue cell cycle progression in talin1 - depleted cells suggesting a role in cellular signalling [ 37 , 38 ] . The ancestral Tln gene appears to have undergone duplication in chordates with the emergence of verte - brates to give rise to talin1 and talin2 [ 39 ] . Inverte - brates and simple chordates have a single talin gene ; vertebrates have two . Chordates can be divided into three major groups : Craniata ( including the verte - brates ) , Cephalochordata ( including the lancelets ) and Tunicata ( including sea squirts ) . Since the original publication on talin evolution [ 39 ] , the genomes of Petromyzon marinus ( one of the Cyclostomata , a jaw - less vertebrate ) [ 40 ] and Branchiostoma ﬂoridae ( a lan - celet , one of the Cephalochordata ) [ 41 ] have been published . Strikingly , the Branchiostoma has only a single talin , whereas the Petromyzon genome encodes two . This conﬁrms and extends the original conclu - sions about talin evolution [ 9 , 39 ] and suggests that the genome duplication leading to present day talin1 and talin2 took place before the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates , but after ( or with ) the divergence of the craniates from other chordates . The acquisition of two different copies of talin appears to be beneﬁcial to an organism ; talin gene duplication has also occurred in Amboebozoa and in Dictyostelium dis - coideum . The Dictyostelium talin genes , TalA and TalB , encode proteins with distinct functions , with TalA required for cell – substrate adhesion , phagocyto - sis and cytokinesis , and TalB required for the force transmission required to support morphogenetic move - ments during differentiation [ 42 ] . Talin domain structure Remarkably , despite millions of years of evolutionary time since talin ﬁrst appeared and since the two talins diverged , the length of both the major talin isoforms has remained almost identical ( talin1 : 2541aa ; talin2 : 2540aa ) . Furthermore , both major isoforms have 2110 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Tale of two talins R . E . Gough and B . T . Goult identical domain structure and contain 18 domains . This invariability is in stark contrast to many other multidomain proteins such as titin , spectrin and ﬁl - amin – these have varied in length , increasing and decreasing in size through evolution until reaching the length we see today [ 43 – 45 ] . This unvarying domain arrangement in all available talin sequences suggests that each domain has a role that is universally required ( it is worth mentioning that in some nonver - tebrate organisms , including Dictyostelium and Droso - phila , talin has acquired additional C - terminal residues that extend beyond the universal domain arrangement [ 39 , 46 ] ) . The following discussion of talin domain structure , therefore , applies to both talin1 and talin2 . The talin head Talins consists of an atypical N - terminal FERM ( 4 . 1 protein , ezrin , radixin , moesin ) domain , known as the talin head containing four subdomains F0 – F3 [ 47 , 48 ] rather than the three subdomains ( F1 – F3 ) found in most other FERM domain proteins . More - over , the crystal structure of the talin1 FERM domain shows a linear domain structure [ 47 ] rather than the cloverleaf structure found in other FERM domain proteins . The structure of the talin2 FERM domain conﬁrms this linear domain arrangement ( our unpublished data ) . Extensive studies show that it is the talin F3 subdomain that directly engages the beta - integrin cytoplasmic tail via the ﬁrst ( mem - brane proximal ) of two NPxY motifs in the tail [ 49 ] . The integrin - binding interfaces have been charac - terised in both the talin1 and talin2 F3 subdomains , and this has revealed that conserved residue changes in the binding surfaces tune the afﬁnities of the two talins for different integrin tails [ 50 ] . For example , the ubiquitous beta1a - integrin was recently shown to bind preferentially to talin2 [ 51 ] whereas the muscle - speciﬁc beta1d - integrin has a threefold higher prefer - ence for talin2 over talin1 [ 33 , 52 , 53 ] . This provides selectivity for different talin and integrin complexes , and different couplings are likely to regulate differ - ent cellular functions [ 54 ] . However , whilst F3 is the only talin head subdo - main that engages the integrin , F3 in isolation is not very effective at activating integrins and the other head subdomains are also required to make an effec - tive ‘integrin activation lock’ and maintain the inte - grin in the active , high - afﬁnity conformation [ 55 ] . The other head subdomains achieve this by interac - tion with phosphoinositides such as PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( PIP2 ) in the plasma membrane ; a basic surface on the F2 subdomain mediates interaction with the plasma membrane , which applies torque on the inte - grin to stabilise the active conformation [ 52 , 56 , 57 ] . In addition , the F1 subdomain contains a large ( ~ 30aa ) unstructured insertion , the F1 - loop , which , via a cluster of positively charged residues , interacts with PIP2 and is essential for integrin activation [ 58 ] . The F0 subdomain has been shown to bind the membrane - tethered small GTPase , Rap1 [ 58 – 60 ] and this interaction has been implicated in membrane targeting of talin to the plasma membrane [ 59 ] . Interestingly , the additional F0 subdomain and the F1 - loop elements of the talin FERM domain are also found in the kindlin family of proteins [ 58 , 61 ] which synergise with talin to activate integrins [ 62 ] . These features are not found in other FERM domain proteins and are unique to integrin - activating FERM domain proteins . As well as binding to integrins , Rap1 and the mem - brane , the talin head ( via the F3 subdomain ) has been shown to bind to PIP kinase gamma [ 63 ] , which is thought to generate the PIP2 required to support inte - grin activation [ 64 ] . Beyond this , the F3 subdomain has emerged as showing remarkable ligand - binding plasticity and has been linked to binding FAK [ 31 ] , TIAM1 ( T - cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 ) [ 65 ] , layilin [ 66 ] , G a 13 ( G - protein subunit Galpha13 ) and RIAM [ 67 ] all via the same site . The hierarchy of these interactions , that are presumably mutually exclu - sive with integrin binding and each other , is not yet fully understood . Talin contains three actin - binding sites ( ABS1 - 3 ) [ 68 ] . ABS1 is in F2 - F3 in the talin head [ 69 ] and has recently been shown to be important for capping actin ﬁlaments to block actin polymerisation [ 70 ] . The talin rod The talin head is connected , via an 82 - amino acid unstructured [ 71 ] calpain - sensitive linker [ 72 , 73 ] to the large 2000 residue talin rod that is made up of 62 a - helices . We have recently determined the boundaries and structures of the talin1 rod domains showing it contains 13 domains ( R1 – R13 ) [ 24 ] organised into two functionally distinct regions , a linear C - terminal rod - like region comprised of 5 - helix bundles and a com - pact N - terminal region where three 4 - helix bundles ( R2 – R4 ) are inserted into the series of 5 - helix bundles ( Fig . 2b ) . Structural analysis of the talin rod was complicated as only two regions of the rod have sequence homol - ogy to other proteins : R13 , which contains an I / LWEQ domain [ 8 , 74 ] , and the central region of the rod ( resolved to be R7 – R8 ) which has homology to a 2111 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies R .

The rest of the rod lacks homology to other proteins meaning prediction of the domain boundaries a priori was not possible . Part of the reason for the lack of homology of the talin rod to other proteins turned out to be that 8 of the 13 talin rod domains – R1 , R5 – R7 , R9 – R12 – Fig . 2 .

( C ) The locations of many of the talin ligand - binding sites are shown , as are the calpain cleavage sites . 2112 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Tale of two talins R . E . Gough and B . T . Goult contain a 5 - helix bundle fold , the ‘talin rod fold’ , that has so far only been recognised in talin . The talin rod fold Although 4 - helix bundles are common in nature ( the 4 - helix up – down bundle present in R2 , R3 , R4 and R8 is a common fold ( SCOP 47161 [ 76 ] ) ) , 5 - helix bundles are unusual . At the core of the talin rod fold is a com - mon 4 - helix up – down , left - handed twist topology as seen in numerous 4 - helix bundles . However , in the talin rod , this fold is augmented by an extra N - term - inal helix , connected by a long ( ~ 9 residue ) loop that allows the ﬁrst helix to pack against helices 3 and 4 of the bundle ( Fig . 2 ) to form a 5 - helix bundle . This addition of an extra helix to the talin rod domains has profound effects on talin function , not least because 5 - helix bundles , where the N - and C - termini are located at opposite ends of the bundle are optimal for forming a rod - like arrangement ( Fig . 2 ) . The linear rod - like region is perfectly designed to transmit forces , which act on the compact N - terminal region . Furthermore , the additional helix signiﬁcantly enhances the thermal and mechanical stability of the domains [ 22 , 77 ] , help - ing provide different mechanical responses for each domain [ 21 ] and restricting access to the cryptic vin - culin - binding sites ( VBS ) buried inside many of the domains . As a result , each rod domain has its own unique properties , and this is central to talins role as a mechanosensor ( see next section ) . Unfolding 5 - helix bundles by pulling on the termini positioned at oppo - site ends of the bundle is restricted by extensive con - tacts throughout the length of the helices and requires a gradual breaking of hydrogen bonds . In 4 - helix bun - dles , the termini are at the same end , and applied force acts on the weak hydrophobic contacts , peeling helices away from the bundle [ 22 ] . Talin dimers Full - length talin is dimeric , and helix 62 [ dimerisation domain ( DD ) ] forms an antiparallel dimer with another talin molecule [ 74 ] . In all our experiments to date , we see talin as a constitutive dimer when the DD is present ; however , a calpain cleavage site immediately prior to the DD means it can be cleaved to yield monomeric talin [ 71 ] . Interestingly , the DD in talin2 is conserved with talin1 , and structural predictions suggest it should be able to form heterodimers . However , to our knowl - edge , heterodimers have not been described in the litera - ture . Dimeric full - length talin1 can adopt a compact autoinhibited conformation in the cytosol [ 78 ] where the two rod domains wrap around to form a ‘double donut’ with the two talin heads buried inside . Activation of tal - ins to a more open - active conformation requires a vari - ety of activators . Talin1 and talin2 rod interactions To date , all the ligands that bind to talin1 have been shown to bind talin2 although the afﬁnities for the dif - ferent isoforms can be markedly different . Binding partners can interact with the talin rod domains via a number of different modes , that is , to the folded rod domains , to the unfolded rod domains or to some strained conformation between these two extremes . Mechanical force can drive transitions between these conformations and so dramatically alter the binding afﬁnities of different ligands . Ligand - binding sites in the talin rod Elucidation of the domain structure of the talin rod has enabled the precise mapping of established ligand - binding sites , and the location of these sites is shown in Fig . 2 . Integrin As well as interacting with the talin head , the beta - integrin tail also interacts with the R11 – R12 domains of the talin rod [ integrin binding site 2 ( IBS2 ) ] via a structurally undeﬁned mechanism [ 79 – 81 ] . Unlike IBS1 where the integrin binds to the folded F3 subdomain , integrin binding to IBS2 appears to involve some inter - mediate conformation of the rod domains ( integrin does not bind folded or unfolded R11 – R12 ) . The role of IBS2 in ﬂies [ 79 , 82 ] has been well established , but its role in mammals is less clear , although it has been linked to nascent adhesion formation [ 83 ] . Actin The talin rod contains two actin - binding sites , ABS2 ( R4 – R8 ) [ 68 , 84 , 85 ] and ABS3 ( R13 - DD ) [ 8 , 86 ] which play different roles in adhesion . The current model of talin function envisages the C - terminal ABS3 [ 74 ] as responsible for the initial force exerted on talin that leads to unfolding of the mechanosensitive talin rod domain , R3 . This triggers vinculin interactions and leads to adhesion maturation [ 23 ] . In contrast , ABS2 , in the centre of the rod provides the tension - bearing actin connection [ 84 , 85 ] . As with the integrin connec - tions , the actin - binding sites in talin2 bind more tightly to actin than the equivalent regions in talin1 ( [ 35 ] and our unpublished data ) . 2113 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies R . E . Gough and B . T . Goult Tale of two talins Vinculin Vinculin , discovered in 1979 [ 87 ] , is another key talin interactor , and has been shown to bind to at least 11 of the 62 talin1 helices [ 88 ] . The vinculin - binding determi - nants lay on one side of each vinculin - binding helix [ 89 ] . However , the VBS are buried within the rod domains and are only exposed by mechanical force ( Fig . 3 ) , enabling vinculin to bind and strengthen the actin con - nection . It has been shown that exposed talin VBS can activate vinculin [ 90 ] , and active vinculin has been shown to be able to activate talin [ 91 ] . The 11 VBS in talin2 are all conserved and so it is likely that the talin2 rod will also engage vinculin in a similar fashion . Other interactors While the integrin - , actin - and vinculin - binding inter - actions deﬁne the primary adapter function of talin , there are an increasing number of additional ligands that bind to the talin rod that contribute to its mechanosignalling capabilities . These are summarised below . Talin binds LD - motif - containing proteins A common mechanism for talin rod - binding proteins is via helix addition , whereby a helix from a ligand packs against the side of a talin rod domain . A num - ber of talin ligands have now been identiﬁed that con - tain an ‘LD - motif’ [ 92 ] that mediates such helix addition . First identiﬁed in paxillin [ 93 ] , amphipathic LD - motif helices bind via the aspartate ( D ) which forms an initial salt bridge with a basic residue at the beginning of the furrow between two adjacent helices of the interacting bundle . Speciﬁcity is then encoded by residues downstream of the ‘LD’ interaction site . This mode of binding to talin was initially identiﬁed from work on the tumour suppressor protein deleted in liver cancer 1 ( DLC1 ) [ 94 , 95 ] . This led on to the identiﬁcation of the talin - binding sequence in RIAM [ 24 , 29 ] as an LD - motif , and the identiﬁcation of pax - illin as a novel talin ligand [ 94 ] . More recently , the KANK ( kidney ankyrin repeat - containing ) proteins have been identiﬁed as LD - motif - containing ligands [ 16 , 17 ] , binding to a conserved face on the R7 5 - helix bundle . The ability of 5 - helix bundles to bind Fig . 3 . Layers and layers of autoinhibition . A striking feature of talins is their remarkable conformational plasticity that enables different ligands to engage the same platform in different conditions ; part of this ﬂexibility emerges from autoinhibition . ( Left ) In the closed autoinhibited form , all of the domains are folded , and many of the ligand - binding sites for actin , integrin and vinculin are thought to be cryptic . Some binding sites may face outwards and remain accessible ; for instance , RIAM is able to bind to the inactive conformation [ 127 ] . In the extended conformation in the absence of force , all the domains are still folded , and additional binding sites are exposed ( IBS1 , IBS2 , ABS3 , plus the sites for those ligands that require folded - rod domains ) ( Right ) . The exposure of IBS1 and ABS3 facilitates adhesion formation , and by activating integrins and crosslinking them to the actin cytoskeleton , a nascent adhesion can form . As force is exerted on talin , another layer of autoinhibition is uncovered ( Bottom ) . As talin domains unfold , starting with R3 , the initial mechanosensor in talin [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] , vinculin - binding sites are exposed and talin : vinculin interactions can now occur . R3 unfolding also reveals the high afﬁnity actin - binding site in talin , ABS2 that can then activate tension - bearing actin connections [ 84 , 85 ] . As domains unfold , the binding sites for ligands that engage the folded rod domains are destroyed , as is the case for RIAM binding to R3 . A remarkable feature of talins conformational plasticity is that , in the absence of other factors , talin can readily refold to its default low - force state . 2114 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Tale of two talins R . E . Gough and B . T . Goult LD - motif proteins greatly expands the number of potential ligand - binding sites in talin . The talin - moesin - NHE - 1 complex and pH modulation of adhesion sites The C - terminal part of the talin rod has also been shown to bind directly to the FERM domain of moe - sin , an interaction that is required to recruit the sodium / hydrogen exchanger ( NHE - 1 ) to adhesion sites [ 96 ] . This recruitment of a proton exchanger to adhe - sions and the resulting localised alterations of intracel - lular pH has a dramatic effect on adhesions . Small changes in local pH can result in protonation / deproto - nation of side chains , particularly histidines , and this can directly alter interactions in a similar fashion to phosphorylation . In many ways , protonation can be considered a post - translational modiﬁcation [ 97 ] . Many important protein : protein interactions have been shown to be regulated by pH in this way , including the interaction of talin ABS3 with actin [ 98 ] , and it is likely that local ﬂuctuations in pH will alter the proto - nation state of many other important interaction sites . The talin – alpha - synemin connection – a link to intermediate ﬁlaments ? Another ligand that has been linked to talin which has the potential to have a signiﬁcant impact on our view of adhesions is alpha - synemin [ 99 ] , an intermediate ﬁl - ament ( IF ) protein expressed in skeletal muscle . This suggests that talin has the potential to coordinate interactions between the actin , microtubule and IF net - works . The mechanical properties of talin The mechanosensing abilities of talin rely on its force - dependent interactions with its binding partners . Some ligands ( i . e . RIAM , KANK , DLC1 , actin ) bind only to folded talin domains , whereas vinculin is known to require domain unfolding and exposure of cryptic VBS . Force - induced talin domain unfolding will therefore release binding partners that bind to folded talin and stimulate binding of vinculin , triggering mechanosensing signals . In vivo , talin is initially extended by actin retrograde ﬂow and then by acto - myosin contractility and the resulting forces exerted on the talin rod drive structural transitions . Depend - ing on the precise mechanical environment , individual talin molecules will experience different forces , and the different conformations may engage different ligands . Mechanotransduction : force driving changes in biological signalling The mutually exclusive interactions between talin and RIAM and talin and vinculin provide the perfect example of how talin can convert mechanical forces into biological signalling responses . The initial mechanosensitive domain in talin has been shown to be R3 [ 23 , 24 ] , which binds RIAM but also contains two VBS . However , vinculin and RIAM have funda - mentally different modes of binding . Talin VBS are buried within the talin rod domains and are only exposed when mechanical force unfolds that domain , allowing vinculin to bind . In contrast , the talin - binding sites in RIAM are single helices that interact only with folded talin rod domains ( Fig . 2 ) . The exquisite mechanosensitivity of R3 is due to the presence of a destabilising cluster of threonine residues buried in its hydrophobic core [ 24 ] . This means that the R3 domain is the ﬁrst to unfold when talin experiences force , driv - ing the transition between folded and unfolded R3 ( this is one of the exciting aspects of structural mechanobiology in that the precise structural basis of a mechanosensitive event can be pinpointed to speciﬁc amino acids that encode the mechanosensitivity ) . This conformational change in R3 drives a change in bio - logical signalling , displacing RIAM and thus the link to the Rap1 signalling pathways . Simultaneously , R3 unfolding leads to the recruitment of vinculin and strengthening of the connection to actin . This allows two different ligands to engage the same talin domain under different conditions and explains the different localisation of RIAM and vinculin in cells [ 100 ] . In the case of R3 , a force of ~ 5 pN is required for it to unfold , disrupting the RIAM - binding sites and recruit - ing vinculin , driving the maturation of nascent adhe - sions into FAs . This 5 pN force is roughly the force of a single actomyosin contraction , leading to an attrac - tive hypothesis that talin only experiences this force threshold when it binds to an integrin and simultane - ously connects to the actin cytoskeleton . Only when these two criteria are met will the R3 domain unfold and trigger adhesion maturation . Expanding this to the rest of the talin rod , it seems likely that each of the talin rod domains can also serve as mechanochemical switches , and under different con - ditions , individual talin rod domains can adopt differ - ent conformations that support different signalling pathways . In vivo measurements of talin extension have shown that talin length is normally between 90 and 250 nm [ 101 ] ( compared with a folded talin length of 50 – 60 nm in vitro [ 102 ] ) , suggesting that between two and eight talin rod domains are unfolded at any 2115 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies R . E . Gough and B . T . Goult Tale of two talins time [ 21 ] . Using single molecule analysis with ultra - stable magnetic tweezers , we recently characterised the mechanical response of talin1 [ 21 – 23 ] . Stretching the whole talin rod revealed quantised mechanical responses with all 13 rod domains exhibiting switch - like behaviour at different force thresholds . These unfolding responses range from ~ 5 to 25 pN and are all rapidly reversible when force is removed . This reveals a spectrum of mechanosensitive switching events , turning on and off distinct effector functions in a force - dependent manner . This stochastic force - depen - dent folding and refolding of talin also make talin an effective force buffer protecting adhesions against excessive force [ 21 ] . The R8 domain is a hotspot for protein interactions , suggesting it represents a major signalling hub . R8 is a 4 - helix bundle , uniquely protected from mechanical force by being inserted into the loop of a 5 - helix bun - dle ( R7 ) , creating a novel 9 - helix module , and a branch in the talin rod [ 21 , 75 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . By being posi - tioned outside of the force - bearing region , R8 remains folded whilst talin is under force and maintains its ligand - binding surface . A striking feature of the talin rod’s response to force is that even after complete unfolding , the removal of force leads to refolding to the original native state , and this response is maintained through multiple cycles of extension and relaxation . The robustness of the mechanical response of the talin rod is perfectly suited to its role as a mechanosensor ; when the mechanical force is relieved , the sensor reverts back to its original state . Together , these features suggest that talins can sense and respond to mechanical forces with remarkable ver - satility . Depending on the applied force , different domains will unfold , and depending on the repertoire of expressed ligands , different signals will be gener - ated . Depending on the mechanism of linkage to actin ( e . g . via ABS2 vs . ABS3 ) , or to microtubules via KANK , different regions of talin will be under ten - sion . This network of protein interactions thus pro - vides a mechanism for context and force - dependent regulation of multiple signalling pathways . It will be important to characterise the mechanical response of talin2 as differences in mechanical responses of individual rod domains might help pin - point sites of functional divergence . Recent work has shown that the two talins provide different mechanical linkages in cells [ 34 ] , with talin2 able to engage vin - culin in the absence of mechanical force , suggesting that the two proteins respond to forces differently . Talin2 is expressed at high levels in cardiac and skele - tal muscle [ 103 ] where presumably its higher afﬁnity for integrin beta1d and actin may serve to create more resilient adhesive connections . Talin : layers and layers of autoinhibition An interesting feature of talins is that the binding sites described above are not all accessible all of the time . Talin activity is regulated by multiple layers of autoin - hibition where binding sites are masked , and only made available for binding in response to different sig - nals . Talin autoinhibition mediated via the interaction between the integrin - binding site in F3 and the talin rod domain R9 maintains talin in a compact cytosolic form [ 104 – 107 ] . The F3 - binding surface on talin2 R9 is highly conserved with only subtle conservative changes , and as such autoinhibition is likely common to both talins . Multiple factors ( e . g . PIP2 , FAK , Vin - culin , RIAM , etc . ) have been implicated in relieving talin autoinhibition , most recently , the G - protein G a 13 which binds F3 , displacing the R9 rod domain , has emerged as an important talin regulator [ 108 ] . Once autoinhibition is relieved , it is likely that some of talins functionalities are exposed , such as the integrin - and membrane - binding sites on the talin head [ 52 , 109 ] , and the C - terminal actin - binding site ABS3 [ 8 , 74 ] . However , other functions are still autoinhibited ; for example , the VBS remain inaccessible , buried in the hydrophobic core of the rod domains . As mechanical force is exerted on talin , its rod domains can unfold , exposing VBS and simultaneously destroying the bind - ing sites for folded rod binders , enabling mechanochemical switching of binding . In this scenar - io , once RIAM has served its purpose and helped translocate talin to the plasma membrane , its binding to talin is no longer required and so those domains are repurposed for alternative functions . Furthermore , high afﬁnity actin binding is mediated via the central actin - binding site ( ABS2 ; R4 – R8 ) which is maintained in an inactive conformation via the inhibitory effects of the adjacent R3 and R9 domains [ 84 ] . As a result of this stratiﬁed nature of talin autoinhibition , the same protein scaffold can coordinate many different processes . There are likely numerous other talin func - tions tightly regulated by talin conformation in a simi - lar fashion . Comparison of the talin1 and talin2 domains Due to the high homology between talin1 and talin2 , we used Modeller [ 110 ] to generate structural models of the talin2 domains using the talin1 structures as templates . Validation of the conserved hydrophobic cores of these domains and comparison of the 2116 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies Tale of two talins R . E . Gough and B . T . Goult modelled F2F3 region of talin2 with the known struc - ture [ 52 ] conﬁrmed the reliability of this modelling approach . The domain boundaries of talin1 and talin2 are shown in Fig . 2 . From this bioinformatics analysis , we have designed and validated expression constructs to express and purify each of the talin2 domains ( de - posited in Addgene www . addgene . org / ben _ goult ) . We have recently solved the structures of a number of these talin2 rod domains and it is striking how struc - turally similar they are to the equivalent talin1 domains ( our unpublished data ) . Conserved differences between the two isoforms The two talins are highly conserved ( 76 % identical ) , and it is likely that identical regions between the two isoforms carry out equivalent functions . What has not been explored in detail is the 24 % of the sequence that is not identical – it is here that differences in isoform function might be found . In particular , we sought to identify conserved differences between the isoforms in these divergent regions as these might provide the key to understand the differences in isoform function . We set out to look at differences in ligand speciﬁcity , afﬁn - ity tuning , tertiary structure and the conservation of post - translational modiﬁcation sites ( PTMs ) . We used BlastP to align the sequences of the corre - sponding domains from each isoform to establish the identity and similarity of each domain and to look for local variations . Interestingly , although the sequence identity between the two talins is 76 % , sequence iden - tity at the domain level shows much greater variation . The F2 ( 86 % ) , F3 ( 89 % ) and R13 ( 92 % ) are highly conserved between isoforms , supporting their role in assembly of the core adhesion complex . In contrast , other regions of the talin rod show considerable varia - tion in conservation between isoforms with R5 ( 60 % ) being the most divergent . Using a sample set of vertebrates , we compared the conservation of each individual talin domain between species and between isoforms . Regions where sequence conservation is low within and between the individual isoforms likely represent regions of less functional importance . In contrast , regions that are highly con - served within an isoform but are less conserved between isoforms might indicate regions of functional divergence . This structure - oriented conservation analy - sis reveals that for some talin rod domains , the bind - ing surfaces are completely conserved between isoforms . For example , talin rod domains , R7 and R8 , both contain binding sites for LD - motif - containing proteins , and the R7 - and R8 - binding surfaces on both talin isoforms are identical . This is reﬂected by the similar binding constants ( K d ) of these domains for their respective ligands , that is , the KANK 1 and KANK 2 binding site on R7 and the RIAM - and DLC1 - binding site on R8 . These proteins bind in the same manner and with the same afﬁnity to both iso - forms ( [ 16 ] and our own unpublished data ) . In contrast , the R5 domain , for which ligands have yet to be identiﬁed , has a highly conserved surface in talin2 with the characteristics of an LD - motif - binding domain , but this surface is markedly different in tal - in1 . Based on this analysis , we suggest that regions of divergence between isoforms that are well conserved within each isoform likely encode regions that deﬁne the subtle differences in isoform functionalities . Talin2 in disease and development The roles of talin2 during embryogenesis and develop - ment are not fully understood , but studies of the two talin isoforms in the heart reveal that they are tightly regulated [ 5 , 111 ] . Both isoforms are highly expressed in cardiomyocytes , but during maturation , and in the mature heart , talin2 becomes the major isoform , local - ising to the costameres [ 111 ] . Indeed , cardiac - speciﬁc talin1 knockout mice show normal basal cardiac func - tion . Interestingly , talin1 is upregulated in the failing human heart , and studies in mice show that an abla - tion of cardiac talin1 blunts the hypertrophic response and improves cardiac function [ 106 ] . The mechanisms behind isoform switching in heart remain to be eluci - dated , but the data clearly indicate that the two talin isoforms play distinct roles in cardiac muscle . Further evidence of the importance of talin2 in development comes from the exome sequencing - based identiﬁcation of a mutation ( S339L in F3 ) in the Tln2 gene that causes ﬁfth ﬁnger Camptodactyly [ 112 ] . Given that tal - in2 is not an essential gene , it seems likely that whole exome sequencing will reveal further disease - associated mutations in the Tln2 gene , and these will provide fur - ther insights into its functions . Interestingly , the Tln2 gene also includes a highly conserved microRNA , miR - 190 , situated in intron 51 [ 10 ] , which has been implicated as a modulator in mul - tiple signalling pathways . Moreover , talin2 has appeared in a number of screens as a protein regulated by microRNAs whose expression is perturbed in cancer [ 53 , 113 ] . Thus , the humanised antibody trastuzumab , which recognises the extracellular domain of HER2 , upregulates miR - 194 expression in two HER2 - positive breast cancer cell lines [ 113 ] , and miR - 194 suppresses cell migration reportedly via downregulation of talin2 . Talin2 is also downregulated by miR - 132 , but miR - 132 expression is itself suppressed by promoter methylation 2117 FEBS Letters 592 ( 2018 ) 2108 – 2125 ª 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies R . E . Gough and B . T . Goult Tale of two talins in prostate cancer cells . This correlates with a worse prognosis , and the authors speculate that elevated tal - in2 levels may suppress cell death and increase metasta - sis [ 114 ] . Talin2 upregulation has also been implicated in breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis [ 33 , 53 ] driving more aggressive cell invasion . Post - translational modiﬁcation of talins Talin has been shown to be regulated by post - transla - tional modiﬁcation and the phosphorylation sites in pla - telet talin1 have been mapped [ 115 ] . Proteomics studies on the ‘adhesome’ also show phosphorylation of talin in adhesions [ 116 ] , but there is much less data on talin2 PTMs . To explore this , we took all reported phosphory - lation and acetylation sites for talin1 and found that the majority were conserved in talin2 ( Table 1 ) . Mass spectrometric analysis of calyculin - treated platelets identiﬁed numerous talin1 phosphorylation sites , with the three most abundant sites being T144 and T150 in the F1 - loop ( phosphorylation appears to negatively reg - ulate integrin activation [ 58 , 115 ] ) and S446 [ 115 ] in the linker between the head and rod domains . Phosphoryla - tion of S446 is believed to be important in the regulation of the calpain cleavage between the head and the rod domain and is important for regulating FA turnover [ 71 , 117 ] , a process that has recently been shown to be essential for adhesion development and rigidity sensing [ 118 ] . In addition , S425 , which is also in the linker , is Table 1 . Post - translational modiﬁcations in talin1 and talin2 . Summary of the identiﬁed talin phosphorylation [ 115 , 116 ] , acetylation [ 128 ] , arginylation [ 121 ] , glycosylation [ 123 ] and methylation sites [ 122 ] . For each PTM , the modiﬁed residue , the domain it is located , and the conservation between isoforms are shown . Residue numbering is for mouse talin1 and talin2 .

E . Gough and B . T . Goult phosphorylated by CDK5 , and this phosphorylation has been shown to enhance talin activity and increase integrin activation [ 119 ] . Calpain cleavage of talin is a permanent PTM , and three cleavage sites have been identiﬁed in talin1 . The best characterised is that within the linker between the talin head and rod ( between residues Q433 and Q434 ) [ 73 ] , but there is a second site immediately prior to the DD ( between residues K2493 and M2494 ) [ 71 ] . Both of these cleavage sites are present in talin2 [ 71 ] . Cal - pain cleavage of the neck exposes a recognition site for the E3 ligase SMURF1 that leads to ubiquitination of the liberated talin1 head [ 120 ] . A third force - dependent calpain cleavage site in the talin1 rod has also been identiﬁed [ 121 ] . This cleavage occurs between residue P1902 and A1903 ( a site which is normally buried in the folded R10 domain ) and is likely to only be acces - sible when talin is under force . This cleavage appears to be regulated by arginylation ( a PTM that only occurs on the N - term residue of proteins [ 121 ] ) . It is not yet known whether this force - dependent cleavage site is also present in talin2 , but the region is well conserved between both isoforms . Finally , a number of additional PTMs have also been identiﬁed in talin1 . For instance , the afﬁnity of the tal - in1 : actin connection is controlled via the methyltrans - ferase Ezh2 which methylates talin at lysine K2454 in ABS3 [ 122 ] . This PTM site is completely conserved in talin2 . Talin1 is also modiﬁed by glycosylation [ 123 ] at sites in R8 and R10 . Interestingly , the glycosylation sites are not conserved between talin1 and talin2 , suggesting that if talin2 is glycosylated , then it is at different sites and linked to different functions . Conclusions and perspectives Gene duplication is often viewed as an evolutionarily advantageous process , with duplicated genes giving rise to two proteins that can acquire distinct or completely new functions ( subfunctionalisation or neofunctionali - sation ) . Gene duplication may also allow more complex patterns of gene expression in different cell types and tissues [ 124 ] . Furthermore , differences in PTM sites as reported here for the two talins may enable new modes of regulation at the protein level . Although both talin isoforms have maintained their ancestral properties relating to cell adhesion , it seems likely that the two isoforms have undergone some neofunctionalisation to generate nuanced , isoform - speciﬁc regulation of sig - nalling in cell adhesion . We imagine a scenario whereby talin2 plays a central role in some tissues , such as car - diac muscle , the brain and kidney , but then also a more global role in ﬁne - tuning the adhesive response in many other cell types . Recent work has shown that the two talins provide different mechanical linkages in cells [ 34 ] , and the ability to measure talins mechanical response both at the single molecule level [ 21 ] , in cells using genetically encoded tension sensors [ 34 , 85 , 125 ] , and in silico with force extension molecular dynamics simulations [ 126 ] provide the tools to understand how talin signalling varies with mechanical forces . Detailed structural and biochemical characterisation of talin interactions is enabling targeted mutations to be designed that speciﬁcally disrupt individual talin func - tions , which in conjunction with the aforementioned technical advances should enable the study of talin function in unprecedented detail . It is likely that fur - ther novel talin - mediated cell functions will be identi - ﬁed as additional binding partners of the two talins are discovered . Many different adhesive structures form on talins which signal in a highly reproducible manner . Precisely how talins’ mechanosignalling capabilities are inte - grated with the more classical signalling pathways to give rise to these robust metastable cellular responses that facilitate all our cellular processes remain to be determined . The signalling pathways that regulate talin function , localisation , post - translational modiﬁcations , etc . coupled with the forces that deﬁne the conforma - tional status of its rod domains , which cumulatively lead to the correct cellular responses are still poorly understood . For talin to generate robust , reproducible signalling responses and specialised adhesive structures in response to such diverse , multiple inputs suggest that there must be a code underpinning talins mechan - otransductive response . Deciphering this ‘talin code’ is the next major challenge .
