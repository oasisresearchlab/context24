Introduction Talking about ageing is not just talking about older people . From a life - span perspective , we all age while we live and from a life - course perspective , our ageing process always happens within the context of diverse age cohorts . Whatever the perspective , it has become evident that multiple indi - viduals and generations are ageing concurrently at any given time in history . Hence , ageing must be approached as a multi - generational phenomenon , not just as a question of older populations . Furthermore , the fact that multiple generations are ageing makes us think of inter - generational interactions as another potential component in the analysis of human ageing processes . From an intergenerational perspective , we not only age but somehow we are ageing together . Demographic studies conclude that apart from lower fertility and longer life expectancy , modern societies are witnessing «an increase in the number of living generations , and a decrease in the number of living relatives within these generations» ( Harper , 2013 : 2 ) . In this context , situations that engender increased interactions between successive generations tend to draw positive atten - tion , whether generations are considered in terms of age ( e . g . older and younger people ) , family links ( e . g . grandparents and grandchildren ) , community life ( e . g . youth and elders ) or organization - al membership ( e . g . seniors and juniors ) . The focus of this paper is linked to the set of planned and intended intergenerational initiatives un - der the name of intergenerational programmes , and our specific emphasis will be put on education and learning processes within intergenerational programmes with a strong technological compo - nent . Typically , the term intergenerational programme refers to activities or programmes that in - crease cooperation , interaction or exchange between any two generations ( Kaplan & Sánchez , 2014 ) . Within the intergenerational studies field , there is a current emphasis on expanding the role of technology in programmes and practices that intentionally connect generations . European Union ( EU ) - funded multi - country initiatives that employ technological advances in innovative , generation - connecting ways , such as «Mix @ ges - Intergenerational Bonding via Creative New Media» , a Grundtvig multilateral project , are prolific . This project , which spans five countries , has explored how the artistic use of digital media can assemble individuals from multiple generations ( Fricke , Marley , Morton & Thome , 2013 ) . In the framework of the EU Lifelong Learning Programme ( 2008 - 11 ) , 21 projects with a primary interest on intergenerational learning and active ageing through digital skills were launched ( European Commission , 2012 ) . Regarding technology development , we are witnessing an abundance of new software and devices for fostering cross - generational relationships within families ( Chen , Wen & Xie , 2012 ; Davis , © COMUNICAR , 45 ( 2015 ) ; e - ISSN : 1988 - 3293 ; Preprint DOI : 10 . 3916 / C45 - 2015 - 10 Vetere , Francis , Gibbs & Howard , 2008 ) . Gershenfeld & Levine ( August 6 , 2012 ) focused on ex - plaining «How can we effectively transform media consumption into quality family time ? » , by em - phasizing video games and their possibilities for facilitating generational encounters in playful learning together . On the same line , Chiong ( 2009 : 22 ) was able to conclude that «the ubiquity of digital media in children’s and adults’ lives is an important untapped opportunity for intergenera - tional contact» . We appreciate how Facebook , Twitter and other social media outlets are assisting families with the ability to stay connected in spite of geographical distance . A 2012 survey which concentrated on how 2000 Americans , ages 13 - 25 and 39 - 75 utilize online communication , determined that 83 % of respondents considered online communication to be an effective method of touching base with family members . Additionally , 30 % of the grandparents and 29 % of the teens / young adults report - ed that through online connections , they better understand each other ( AARP , 2012 ) . In considering certain features of intergenerational programmes with a strong technological com - ponent such as area and level of impact , status of generational groups , and centrality of technolo - gy , it is useful to reflect more largely on the role of technology in the social lives of both younger and older individuals . The Center for Technology and Aging’s recent report , entitled «The new era of connected aging» , states that «We are at the dawning of ‘Connected Aging’ in which the grow - ing array of Internet - based technologies and mobile devices increasingly will support older adults to age in place» ( Ghosh , Ratan , Lindeman & Steinmetz , 2013 : 1 ) . However , it is also becoming evident that many individuals with limited access to technology , along with technology skills and support , are less likely to obtain the many social benefits associated with the ongoing and numerous advancements in technology . There is recognition , within the literature on how older adults use Information and Communication Technologies ( ICT ) , that adoption of new technologies by older adults is neither quick , simple , nor universally accepted ( Feist , Parker & Hu - go , 2012 ; Selwyn , Gorard , Furlong & Madden , 2003 ) . Furthermore , within the population of adults aged 65 + , older seniors with lower levels of educational attainment and income are frequently lag - ging behind in terms of ICT adoption . They are also more likely to have difficulties when using new digital devices , and sceptical attitudes about the benefits of technology ( Smith , 2014 ) . On an en - couraging note , however , it is also the case that when older adults transcend these obstacles , they tend to become more positive about the online world and adept in utilizing digital technology ( Smith , 2014 ) . In terms of how children / youth use new technologies , here too , the data is mixed . There is certainly potential for technology to contribute to the well - being and development of youth , yet various fac - tors need to be considered , such as the ability of youth to detect and avoid threats of which tech - nologies may pose . Fortunately , there is evidence that youth are becoming more high - tech and more able to protect themselves . According to a recent Pew Research Center survey of 802 Amer - ican youth aged 12 - 17 and their parents that explored technology use , youth are becoming more skilled at managing the privacy of their online information , including when sharing personal infor - mation on their social media profiles , and in taking technical and non - technical steps to keep that information from reaching businesses and advertisers ( Madden , Lenhart & al . , 2013 ) . What if we tried to connect different generations around technology issues ? In one such example , a group of youth researchers in Australia studying youth online behaviour ( Third , Richardson , Col - lin , Rahilly & Bolzan , 2011 ) conducted an action research study in which a group of youth facilitat - ed a series of technology education workshops on social networking and cybersecurity for adults . After analysing the subsequent dialogue between the youth and adults , the researchers concluded that the youth in their study could handle the online risks more effectively than most adults antici - pated . Many of these youth became proficient in cybersafety issues through informal learning pro - cesses , such as peer knowledge sharing and trial and error . Many technology - oriented intergenerational programmes rely on youth with technology expertise to help older adults navigate and become comfortable with the world of «digital inclusion» , while older adult participants contribute to other programme objectives , such as teaching youth about local community history or working collaboratively on community improvement projects . One such ex - © COMUNICAR , 45 ( 2015 ) ; e - ISSN : 1988 - 3293 ; Preprint DOI : 10 . 3916 / C45 - 2015 - 10 ample has taken root in a rural community in Scotland : «Young and old would work together ; the elders have a vast local knowledge , the young have an intuitive understanding of contemporary technology and practitioners would bring insights from the design sector» ( CLD Standards for Scot - land Report , 2010 : 6 ) . Over time , new modes of communication become possible . As older adult participants gain tech - nology skills and confidence , they transform themselves into what Ghosh , Ratan , Lindeman & Steinmetz ( 2013 : 12 ) term as «empowered ‘prosumers’ of information in the digital world» ) , and the technology - related communication dynamic becomes more multi - directional . Certain assumptions should be put aside when developing intergenerational programmes with a significant technology component . For example , older adults might be more digitally competent than the participating youth . A survey conducted by EU Kids Online ( 2011 ) questioned the com - mon assumption that youth were innately digitally literate . Survey results indicated that only 36 % of the participating 9 - 16 - year - olds stated that it was very true that they know more about the internet than their parents . This report also highlights limitations in the way many youth are currently using computing . In taking a more nuanced view about how youth engage with technology , it is important to consider the degree to which the content is pre - determined and the extent to which the «televis - ual» experience promotes passivity . As Hall ( 2012 : 97 ) states , « [ Such characteristics are ] particu - larly problematic for the development of creativity and creative education» . This paper describes results from a survey designed to scan and contextualize the terrain of inter - generational programmes that have a substantial technology component . The identified pro - grammes span a range of family contexts and community settings , and utilize new and emerging technologies to build relationships , promote understanding and facilitate cooperation between gen - erations . In reporting survey results , as you see below , we draw significantly on respondents’ sur - vey quotes to demonstrate a composite representation of programme innovation , success and challenge . 2 . Material and methods 2 . 1 . Survey Our project team created a survey aimed at gathering data about intergenerational programmes that have a significant technology component , i . e . programmes in which technology had been in - cluded intentionally as a method to connect generations . The survey was organized in two sec - tions : organization / primary contact information , and program specific questions about the use of technology . In order to identify intergenerational technology programmes to be a part of the survey , project team members utilized a threefold strategy over a 16 - week period ( from February 1 to May 15 , 2013 ) . This strategy included outreach through intergenerational list - serves ( managed by local , national , and international membership organizations ) and personal contact with intergenerational practitioners , a structured web search ( via Google Search ) , and literature review ( via Google Scholar , SCOPUS , and Web of Knowledge ) for the period January 1 , 2009 to December 31 , 2012 . The following terms were used in the web search and the literature review : «intergenerational pro - gram» and «technology» , «intergenerational project» and «technology» , «intergenerational activi - ty» and «technology» , and «intergenerational technology program» . Similar strategies for screen - ing and scoping this type of programmes have already been implemented in the intergenerational field ( Bishop & Moxley , 2012 ; Flora & Faulkner , 2007 ; Jarrott , 2011 ) . All programmes retrieved through the web search , literature review and outreach to relevant list - serves were evaluated on the following criteria inspired in previous work by Brophy & Bawden ( 2005 ) : accessibility ( programme is within reach ) , topicality ( programme matches research’s sub - ject matter ) , and relevance ( relevant , partially relevant , not relevant ) to the study objectives . Only those programmes partially or fully meeting the following three relevance sub - criteria were consid - ered suitable for our sample : ( i ) facilitating intergenerational engagement is an explicit goal , ( ii ) the initiative involves more than a single contact or one - time only activity , and ( iii ) technology is used as a tool to facilitate connections across age groups . © COMUNICAR , 45 ( 2015 ) ; e - ISSN : 1988 - 3293 ; Preprint DOI : 10 . 3916 / C45 - 2015 - 10 Of the 72 surveys that were completed and submitted , 46 intergenerational programmes 1 were retained for analysis after examining them for redundancy , completeness , and selection criteria . 2 . 2 . Analysis The project team utilized a mixed - methods analytic strategy ( Greene , 2008 ) . After descriptive anal - ysis ( ranges and frequencies ) of quantitative data , two members of the research team reviewed approximately 25 % of the raw data with the overarching purpose of developing response catego - ries to encompass the full range of the survey’s qualitative data and frame it in the context of sev - eral themes ( provisional coding ) prevalent in the intergenerational studies literature that addresses issues related to intergenerational communication , relationship formation , and use of technology . Codes ( 113 in total ) were established for a series of variables that fit into four major categories : programme objectives , programme description , technology use , and ( perceived ) technology im - portance . Some excerpts were assigned multiple codes according to principles of simultaneous coding ( Saldaña , 2009 ) . After several joint coding sessions , two members of the research team then worked independently to review and code the entire database ( consisting of 431 excerpts ) . All differences in coding were reconciled and an acceptable inter - rater reliability rate ( pooled Cohen’s Kappa ) of . 93 ( Hruschka , Schwartz & al . , 2004 ; Lombard , Snyder - Duch & Campanella , n . d . ) was finally achieved . 2 . 3 . Sample description Information from a total of 46 intergenerational programmes from 11 countries was gathered through the survey . United States ( 19 programmes ) , United Kingdom ( 9 programmes ) , and Ger - many ( 7 programmes ) were the most represented countries . There were also 3 programmes from Canada , 2 programmes from Ireland and Portugal , and 1 programme from the rest of countries in the sample ( Belgium , Hong Kong , Italy , Romania , and Taiwan ) . Regarding time in existence , 33 programmes were 1 - 3 years old and five of our sampled pro - grammes had been in place for ten or more years . Age distribution of participants ranged from 0 - 5 to 85 + years old , with 80 . 4 % and 67 . 4 % of the programmes including 15 - 24 and 25 - 54 years old youth and adults , respectively . The least represented age group of programme participants was that of 65 - 74 years old , with just 19 . 6 % of sampled programmes . The most typical frequency of intergenerational interaction facilitated by programmes in the sample was weekly ( 28 . 3 % ) , followed by programmes whose participants interacted 2 - 3 times per month ( 19 . 6 % ) , and daily / almost daily ( 15 . 2 % ) . There was also a question on the survey which asked about the type ( s ) of technology being used by the respondents’ organizations . Computer ( desktop ) devices , including Smart Boards and iPads , were used by 93 . 5 % of the programmes . Approximately half of the programmes ( 54 . 3 % ) had incorporated online platforms for sharing content and mobile communication devices . Lastly , 19 . 6 % of intergenerational programmes in the study were using gaming platforms , 17 . 4 % had adopted digital cameras and e - readers , 15 . 2 % counted on social media , and 13 % used online pub - lishing platforms . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Intended impact Table 1 , below , categorizes the programmes in the survey according to the major area ( s ) of in - tended impact . The most frequent category of response is in the focus area of education and learn - ing ; survey responses extended to teaching and learning in non - formal as well as formal education settings . © COMUNICAR , 45 ( 2015 ) ; e - ISSN : 1988 - 3293 ; Preprint DOI : 10 . 3916 / C45 - 2015 - 10 Table 1 .

Most programmes were designed to have a positive impact on the lives of the participants ( 74 % ) , whether through helping older individuals in developing ICT skills or through raising awareness of and reducing digital exclusion amongst older people . While a majority of these programmes were primarily focused on enhancing individual participants’ technology - related knowledge and skills , 24 % of the programmes in the sample also targeted non - technology related capabilities such as how to maintain a healthy lifestyle and improve second language skills . Interestingly , 15 % of pro - grammes in our sample were not pursuing just individual impact but specific reduction of the sense of isolation or exclusion among older people . 3 . 2 . Technological capacity and status As noted in Tables 2 and 3 , below , youth participants were viewed as having more status ( at least when it comes to dealing with matters related to technology ) and as being more readily positioned to take on the role of technology tutor or teacher than the adult participants . Table 2 . Generational differences in technological capacity RESPONSE CATE - GORIES PERCENTAGE OF PROGRAMMES EXAMPLE QUOTES Equal status ( starting programme on an «equal footing» pre - sumed equal level of competence ) 34 . 8 % «KOJALA is a network of and for older and younger people , who are prepared to share their knowledge and abilities with others» .

Older adults first ( as - sumed to have an advantage ) 4 . 3 % «The school2work platform has been developed for mentors in Germany that support young people on their way from school to work» . Table 3 , below , illustrates distinctions in the surveyed programmes with regard to the direction of the technology - related teaching and learning . Although there were significantly more «youth as teacher» responses than «older adults as teachers» , the most frequent type of response ( 63 % of programmes ) emphasized complementary contributions to both teaching and project leadership . For more detailed analysis , this latter category was broken into two sub - categories : emphasis on joint learning / joint teaching and emphasis on common goals and sense of intergenerational part - nership . © COMUNICAR , 45 ( 2015 ) ; e - ISSN : 1988 - 3293 ; Preprint DOI : 10 . 3916 / C45 - 2015 - 10 Table 3 .

Rather , the different groups were supposed to devote equally to both a common task and a common theme . It was therefore judicious not only to stake on a good dialogue , but a dialogue of equals ( in eye level ) , and that right from the very beginning» . 3 . 3 . Importance of technology The programmes that were surveyed utilize a variety of methods to enable cross generational communication , cooperation , and relationship formation . How essential is the technology part of these generation - linking strategies ? Table 4 , below , addresses this question by distinguishing be - tween respondents’ comments regarding the role of technology as being central vs . secondary to the intergenerational engagement within the surveyed programmes . A disproportionate number of responses ( 73 . 9 % versus 36 . 9 % of programmes , respectively ) un - derscored that the technology component is of central rather than secondary importance to the fundamental nature of the surveyed programme models . Table 4 .

( There are times when ) Technology is not needed 6 . 5 % «My students and I also give educational lectures without using computers , but our main focus is teaching seniors how to play cognitively stimulating games» . The illustrative body of responses identified within the category of «blended technology strate - gies» , for example those that incorporate technology - intensive as well as «technology free» com - ponents into programme activities , provides some clues with regard to how practitioners weave new technology tools into their cross - age programme activities . For example , one respondent wrote : «Without the smart board , we found that some of the kids were done with an activity before the older adults were finished» . In this particular example , access to the smart board technology complements and enhances an existing activity in need of some modification . It is a question of how the face - to - face contact and technology - mediated contact bolster each other . Respondents indicated many additional aspects of technology that must be considered for pro - grammes :  Appropriateness of the technology ( 21 . 7 % of programmes ) . This includes developing age friendly technology tools and using high - tech equipment to develop appealing ice breaker activities .  Comfort level ( 13 % of programmes ) . Emphasis is on using technology that is non - threatening and user - friendly . «The challenge remains getting participants and staff com - fortable with the technology» .  Access to the technology ( 6 . 5 % of programmes ) : «We are very aware that many of the most valuable local and intergenerational activities within Historypin happen offline - often inevitably offline because of skills and access» . 4 . Discussion and conclusion The majority of the intergenerational technology programmes that we examined include an educa - tion function and emphasis , which consists of more than solely learning how to use technology . Reading Table 1 from a diffusion of innovations perspective ( Rogers , 2003 ) , the emphasis on learning may just be an early stage , to be followed by a series of steps involving experimentation and , ultimately , adoption of the technology in different formats and contexts . Within the framework of intergenerational practice , the education - learning - technology triangle encloses a rather complex array of possibilities . The majority of the programmes that we surveyed aspire to have a positive influence on individual programme participants through improving both technology - and non - technology - related knowledge and skills . This knowledge can serve as a conduit for generating new modes of inter - generational collaboration ( within and beyond families ) and joint social and communal action ; it is not necessarily an endpoint in and of itself . Therefore , attention to individual impact ( including learning ) is not adopting a fully individualistic approach as it is through the multi - generational strategies cast within relationship - building and shared social and community contexts that efforts with an education component take form . There is a distinct thread of response that undervalues or under appreciates older people’s assets . This orientation for using information technology to enhance the quality of life for older adults can be characterized as «deficit - driven design» in contrast to «positive design» . According to Carroll , Convertino , Farroa & Rosson ( 2011 : 7 ) , in the former , «the design intervention orients to and ad - dresses problems , in this case the negatives of growing old alone and isolated , and seeks to miti - gate these deficits» . However , in positive design , «the design intervention orients to and address - es human or organizational strengths and seeks to leverage but also further strengthen them or facilitate their expression in new activities» ( Carroll , Convertino , Farroa & Rosson , 2011 : 7 ) . © COMUNICAR , 45 ( 2015 ) ; e - ISSN : 1988 - 3293 ; Preprint DOI : 10 . 3916 / C45 - 2015 - 10 Earlier in this paper we underscored that often youth participants in intergenerational programmes who have a strong technology component are frequently disproportionally respected for their digi - tal competency and are often positioned in the role of technology teachers / tutors , individually or as equal partners with older adult participants . However , several respondents referenced a multifac - eted relationship in which members of both generations make meaningful ( and often reciprocal ) contributions . The most frequently surveyed model is , when the youth guide the technology educa - tion , while the older adults substantially contribute in other ways , such as teaching gerontology students about a topic related to the experience of aging . The success relies on interlocking goals , and include reciprocity in learning . As there are so many configurations with regard to participants’ technological competencies and the programmatic roles they play , we have found that the dynamic of who does the teaching is not necessarily a generational issue . Reinforcing our conclusions in this regard , we found multiple accounts in the literature that emphasize the technology teaching capacity of young people in work settings ( Bailey , 2009 ) , the often significant influence that grandparents have on youth learning about science and technology ( Jane & Robbins , 2007 ) , and the power of intergenerational teams to innovate and apply new technologies ( Large , Nesset , Beheshti & Bowler , 2006 ) . The themes of co - learning , collaboration , and the primacy of the intergenerational relationship that were present in the current survey results are also significant in the broader field of intergenera - tional studies . This is emphasized as a best practice guideline provided in a recent document by ECIL ( European Certificate in Intergenerational Learning ) emphasizes the importance of encour - aging «reciprocal learning» ( i . e . , opportunities in which the generations learn from and with one another ) ( ECIL , 2013 ) . Our intergenerational technology programmes survey represents a preliminary effort to discover how new technological developments are currently being utilized in a range of intergenerational settings and contexts . The data gathered captures some innovative strategies for effectively apply - ing technology to connect generations in such areas of emphasis as enhancing health and wellbe - ing , strengthening families , and working to improve community life . However , perhaps as an arte - fact of how the survey was constructed and distributed ( e . g . , it is a very short and general survey , and the emphasis is on identifying formal intergenerational programmes ) , we had limited access to experts at the forefront of technological innovation , in areas such as robotics and the construction of new types of technological devices for recording , organizing , and sharing information . In concluding , we believe that technology is a powerful medium for intergenerational exchange . Our stance , which has remained consistent from before we began this project to its completion , is that technology is value neutral . In framing this technology «neutrality thesis» ( Pitt , 2000 ) from an intergenerational engagement perspective , we not only pay attention to creative , effective , and positive ways in which technology is being used to connect the generations , but also remain cog - nizant of the potential of technology to delimit authentic intergenerational communication and meaningful understanding . The main question is how intergenerational programmes can apply technology while staying true to underlying goals and corresponding values for promoting inter - generational learning and education in ageing societies . There are many accounts of the ways in which advances in technology can have a negative as well as a positive influence on the lives of older and younger people . For example , within the family contexts the expertise of youth using electronic media and peer - oriented participation in social networks can be a divisive influence on family relations ( Figuer , Malo & Bertran , 2010 ) , and sometimes technology functions as both , a barrier and an opportunity ( EMIL , 2013 : 25 ) . The results from our survey of intergenerational technology programmes are promising . We learned about various ways in which technological tools and services can help : older adults to have positive aging experiences and maintain social connectivity ; youth to gain skills that contrib - ute to their employability ; community residents to preserve local history and take part in local plan - ning endeavours ; and family members to stay in contact and maintain lines of social support across geographic distance . The challenge , which many of the programmes that were surveyed © COMUNICAR , 45 ( 2015 ) ; e - ISSN : 1988 - 3293 ; Preprint DOI : 10 . 3916 / C45 - 2015 - 10 confron , t relates to relationship - building , particularly with regard to discovering ways in which «high tech» can lead to «high touch» .
