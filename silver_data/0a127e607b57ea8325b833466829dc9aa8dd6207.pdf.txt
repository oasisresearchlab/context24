De La Cruz 2 * 1 Department of Biochemistry Molecular Biology and Biophysics , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , MN 55455 , USA 2 Department of Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry Yale University , New Haven CT 06520 , USA We have measured the effects of coﬁlin on the conformation and dynamics of actin ﬁlaments labeled at Cys374 with erythrosin - iodoacetemide ( ErIA ) , using time - resolved phosphorescence anisotropy ( TPA ) . Coﬁlin quenches the phosphorescence intensity of actin - bound ErIA , indicating that binding changes the local environment of the probe . The coﬁlin concentration - dependence of the phosphorescence intensity is sigmoidal , consistent with cooperative actin ﬁlament binding . Model - independent analysis of the anisotropies indicates that coﬁlin increases the rates of the microsecond rotational motions of actin . In contrast to the reduction in phosphorescence intensity , the changes in the rates of rotational motions display non - nearest - neighbor cooperative interactions and saturate at substoichiometric coﬁlin binding densities . Detailed analysis of the TPA decays indicates that coﬁlin decreases the torsional rigidity ( C ) of actin , increasing the thermally driven root - mean - square torsional angle between adjacent ﬁlament subunits from w 4 8 ( C Z 2 . 30 ! 10 K 27 Nm 2 radian K 1 ) to w 17 8 ( C Z 0 . 13 ! 10 K 27 Nm 2 radian K 1 ) at 25 8 C . We favor a mechanism in which coﬁlin binding shifts the equilibrium between thermal ErIA - actin ﬁlament conformers , and facilitates two distinct structural changes in actin . One is local in nature , which affects the structure of actin’s C terminus and is likely to mediate nearest - neighbor cooperative binding and ﬁlament severing . The second is a change in the internal dynamics of actin , which displays non - nearest - neighbor cooperativity and increases the torsional ﬂexibility of ﬁlaments . The long - range effects of coﬁlin on the torsional dynamics of actin may accelerate P i release from ﬁlaments and modulate interactions with other regulatory actin ﬁlament binding proteins . q 2005 Elsevier Ltd .

( 2005 ) 353 , 990 – 1000 and the DNase - binding loop , 8 disrupts the interface between subdomains 1 and 2 along the long - pitch helix of ﬁlaments 9 and weakens stabilizing lateral contacts in the ﬁlament . 10 , 11 The change in ﬁlament twist is propagated along the ﬁlament to actin subunits without bound coﬁlin . 6 , 7 Coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments is cooperative 5 and can be described by a nearest - neighbor cooperative binding model . 12 Cooperative inter - actions may be mediated through conformational rearrangement of subdomain 2 of actin , 12 which facilitates local changes in subunit tilt observed by electron microscopy . 7 Actin ﬁlaments display two types of large - scale movements : long - axis ( ﬂexural ) bending and long - axis ( torsional ) twisting ( Figure 1 ) . Bending and twisting depend on the bound nucleotide and cation , 13 , 14 interactions with actin - binding pro - teins , 13 – 16 and actin isoforms . 17 , 18 The ﬂexural rigidity of actin ﬁlaments is larger than the torsional rigidity so ﬁlaments twist more easily than they bend . The coﬁlin - induced change in average ﬁlament twist 5 , 6 may modulate the mechanical properties of actin ﬁlaments . We are testing this hypothesis using transient phosphorescence anisotropy ( TPA ) . TPA of erythrosin - labeled actin has been successfully applied to describe the microsecond timescale dynamics of actin ﬁlaments and structural changes in the region of actin’s C terminus . 15 , 16 , 18 – 22 We have previously shown that ( 1 ) TPA of actin cannot be accounted for by rigid body rotations , but reﬂects primarily intra - ﬁlament torsional motions that can be explained in terms of the torsional twist model , and ( 2 ) changes in the phosphorescence intensity monitor local conformational changes in actin . 15 , 16 , 18 – 20 Here , we demonstrate that coﬁlin binding increases the microsecond dynamics and the torsional ﬂexibility of actin ﬁlaments , and that these effects can propagate to vacant sites on the ﬁlament . Results Effect of coﬁlin on time - resolved phosphor - escence intensity decays of actin ﬁlaments The phosphorescence intensity decays of erythrosine iodoacetamide ( ErIA ) - actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 2 ) were analyzed by ﬁtting data to a sum of two exponentials ( equation ( 3 ) ) with amplitudes I 1 and I 2 , and the corresponding lifetimes , t 1 and t 2 . The observed phosphorescence intensity decay is dominated ( I 1 w 0 . 8 ) by a long lifetime ( t 1 Z w 220 m s ) component , with a small contribution ( I 2 w 0 . 2 ) from a shorter lifetime ( t 2 Zw 30 m s , “inter - mediate” ) component . The multiple components contributing to the decay imply that there exist multiple ( at least two ) actin conformations with microsecond lifetimes . The amplitudes and life - times of both the long ( t 1 ) and intermediate ( t 2 ) lifetime components are reduced in a coﬁlin concentration - dependent manner ( i . e . both inten - sity decays are more rapid with bound coﬁlin ; data not shown ) . There is also a rapidly decaying component ( t / 4 m s , short lifetime ) in the presence of coﬁlin , as indicated by the reduction in initial phosphorescence intensities ( Figure 2 , inset ) . We refer to the amplitude of this rapidly decaying phase as I 3 and the lifetime as t 3 . Coﬁlin binding increases the population of short ( t 3 ) and the intermediate ( t 2 ) lifetime components , and reduces the population of the long lifetime ( t 1 ) species ( Figure 3 ) . The mole fractional distribution of these three components depends sigmoidally on the coﬁlin concentration , consistent with coopera - tive coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments . 5 , 9 , 12 The reciprocal partitioning of the short and long lifetime components ( X 1 and X 2 ; Figure 3 ) suggests that these two states are in equilibrium , and that coﬁlin binding shifts the equilibrium distribution of these two states . Detailed balance requires that if coﬁlin shifts the equilibrium between two conformations , it must bind preferentially to one of the two . Although equilibrium coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments is well - described by a nearest - neighbor Figure 1 . Conformational dynamics of actin ﬁlaments . Schematic representation of actin ﬁlament thermal motions . Figure 2 . Effect of coﬁlin on the time - resolved phosphorescence intensity decays of ErIA - actin ﬁlaments .

The inset shows the same data with the time axis plotted on a log scale . Coﬁlin Affects Actin Filament Torsional Dynamics 991 cooperativity model , 12 the multiple equilibrium conformations complicate the nearest - neighbor analysis . Effect of coﬁlin on time - resolved phosphor - escence anisotropy ( TPA ) of actin ﬁlaments Coﬁlin binding has a signiﬁcant effect on the phosphorescence anisotropy decays of ErIA - actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 4 ) . Light - scattering and sedimen - tation demonstrate that coﬁlin does not depolymer - ize actin under our experimental conditions ( data not shown , 12 ) . Therefore , coﬁlin - induced changes in anisotropy arise from the modulation of internal microsecond ﬁlament dynamics . Model - independent analysis : sum of exponentials The effect of coﬁlin on actin dynamics was ﬁrst analyzed in terms of a model - independent ﬁt of the anisotropy decays to the sum ( n Z 2 ) of exponentials ( equation ( 5 ) ) to obtain the rotational correlation times ( f i ) , the initial anisotropy ( r 0 ) and the ﬁnal anisotropy ( r N ) . The correlation times ( f i ; i . e . reciprocal rate constants ) characterize the rates of rotational motions , the initial phosphorescence anisotropy ( r 0 ) characterizes the amplitude of local sub - microsecond motions of the dye and / or cysteine 374 relative to actin ( a lower value means more mobile ) , and the ﬁnal anisotropy ( r N ) characterizes the angular amplitudes of micro - second timescale ﬁlament motions ( i . e . global motions ) . The initial phosphorescence anisotropy of actin - bound ErIA ( r 0 Z 0 . 105 ) is signiﬁcantly lower than that of immobilized ErIA ( r 0 Z 0 . 205 19 ) due to fast , submicrosecond motion of the dye relative to actin . Coﬁlin binding reduces the initial anisotropy ( r 0 ) in a non - stoichiometric manner ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) . The best ﬁts of the data to equation ( 11 ) show that a single bound coﬁlin affects the initial anisotropy of 90 G 24 actin subunits . Thus , the coﬁlin - mediated effect can be propagated to vacant subunits in the Figure 3 . Coﬁlin concentration - dependence of the observed intensity decay mole fractions ( X ) .

The inset shows the same data with the time axis plotted on a log scale . Figure 5 . Coﬁlin concentration - dependence of the initial ( r 0 ) and ﬁnal ( r N ) anisotropies of ErIA actin . The continuous lines represent the best ﬁts to equation ( 11 ) and indicate that coﬁlin affects the initial anisotropy of 90 G 24 subunits and the ﬁnal anisotropy of O 400 subunits . Uncertainty bars represent standard deviations from data sets collected on four separate days . The actin concen - tration was 1 . 8 m M . The binding density was estimated from the data presented in Figure 3 , which are comparable to our previous determinations with pyrene actin ﬁlaments . 12 992 Coﬁlin Affects Actin Filament Torsional Dynamics ﬁlament ( i . e . there are non - nearest - neighbor cooperative interactions ) . This range of cooperativity represents a lower limit , because the phosphorescence lifetimes and the total intensity signal ( Figure 2 ) decrease with added coﬁlin . Consequently , the effect of coﬁlin on the observed anisotropy is less than the effect on the theoretical anisotropy ( equation ( 7 ) ) , so the cooperative unit is larger than estimated from the concentration - dependence of the observed anisotropy reduction ( i . e . if quenching did not occur , the slope would be steeper ) . The low signal - to - noise ratio at high [ coﬁlin ] , due to quenching of phosphorescence intensity ( Figure 2 ) , decreases the reliability of the anisotropy data as coﬁlin concentration approaches saturation . The maximum observed decrease in the initial anisotropy ( r 0 ) , from 0 . 105 G 0 . 007 in actin to 0 . 069 G 0 . 016 in coﬁlactin ﬁlaments ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) , indicates an increase in the half - cone angle of the submicrosecond wobble ( q c ) from 37 ( G 2 ) 8 in actin to 47 ( G 4 ) 8 in actin ﬁlaments saturated with coﬁlin ( Equation ( 6 ) ) . The ﬁnal anisotropy ( r N ) reaches a minimum at a coﬁlin binding density / 0 . 1 ( Figure 5 ( b ) ) , indicat - ing that the coﬁlin - induced increase in the angular amplitude of the microsecond rotational motions is also cooperative . The best ﬁt of the data has a large uncertainty but indicates that the ﬁnal anisotropy of several hundred actin subunits ( 427 G 355 ) are affected by bound coﬁlin . This maximal effect of r N at substoichiometric coﬁlin binding densities is consistent with long - range , non - nearest - neighbor cooperative interactions modulating the internal dynamics of actin ﬁlaments . Filament severing , predicted to occur at low binding densities and cluster sizes , 12 would also lower r N . Model - dependent analysis : torsional twist The effect of coﬁlin on actin dynamics was analyzed in terms of the torsional twist model ( equation ( 8 ) ) . In this model , the actin ﬁlament is regarded as an array of cylindrical elementary rods and the observed anisotropy decay results from the combined global motions , which represent overall rigid - body tumbling and intraﬁlament twisting motions . Therefore , to determine the intraﬁlament torsional constant ( a ) from the TPA data ( equation ( 7 ) ) accurately , corrections for rigid - body motions must be made . Thermal bending motions , which occur on the millisecond timescale , are too slow to be detected by TPA . Similarly , rigid - body tumbling motions can contribute to the microsecond TPA decay only for those ﬁlaments that are much shorter than the typical 4 m m long ﬁlaments observed in the absence of coﬁlin ( Figure 6 ) . 15 Since coﬁlin - induced fragmentation of actin could produce ﬁlaments that tumble on the time - scale of TPA measurements , the equilibrium length distribution ( l i ) of actin ﬁlaments at saturating coﬁlin was measured by electron microscopy ( Figure 6 ) and included in the ﬁt function ( equation ( 8 ) ) , allowing us to separate the effect of rigid - body rotations of short actin - coﬁlin ﬁlaments on TPA from the intraﬁlament motions . The ﬁlament radius is constrained when ﬁtting the data to determine the torsional constant ( a ) , so our determination of a was limited to bare and fully decorated ﬁlaments , which have well - deﬁned homogenous radii . The radius of an actin ﬁlament ( a ) was taken to be 4 . 5 ! 10 K 9 m based on the maximum diameter of 90 – 95 A˚ reported by Holmes . 23 The diameter of a coﬁlin - decorated actin ﬁlament was determined to be 6 . 7 ! 10 K 9 m by measuring the width of the bare and coﬁlin - decorated actin ﬁlament . 5 The ﬁt value for the torsional constant ( a ) increases by a factor of about 2 when the assumed radius of bare actin is reduced from 4 . 5 nm to 3 . 5 nm . 24 With coﬁlin - saturated actin , when the assumed radius is reduced from 6 . 7 nm to 5 . 7 nm , the torsional constant increases by w 50 % . Therefore , although the best ﬁt values of the torsional constant ( a ) depend on assumptions of actin ﬁlament radii , the uncertainty in determining a is no more than a factor of 2 . Coﬁlin binding has minimal effects on the orientations of absorption and emission dipoles of ErIA ( Table 1 ) , but lowers the spring constant ( a ) and thus the torsional rigidity C ( calculated as a h ) by a factor of about 20 ( Table 1 ) . This indicates that while coﬁlin - induced changes in the average actin ﬁlament subunit orientation , as detected from the ErIA probe at the actin C terminus , are subtle ( ! 10 8 tilt with respect to the long ﬁlament axis ) , ﬁlaments with bound coﬁlin are torsionally more ﬂexible , displaying larger and more rapid microsecond twisting motions than native actin ﬁlaments . Actin ﬁlaments are best described as a continuous elastic rod . 19 However , if the continuous elasticity is expressed as an elasticity per subunit rise in the Figure 6 . Length distribution of ErI - actin ﬁlaments . The [ ErIA - actin ] is 1 . 8 m M and the [ coﬁlin ] are : 0 ( a ) and 4 . 0 ( b ) m M . Coﬁlin Affects Actin Filament Torsional Dynamics 993 ﬁlament ( h Z 2 . 75 ! 10 K 9 m ) , the root mean squared average thermal ﬂuctuation of the torsion angle ( h Dx i ) between adjacent subunits in a ﬁlament ( i . e . angular disorder ) can be calculated from the torsional constant ( equation ( 10 ) 25 ) . Coﬁlin binding increases the amplitude of the actin subunit torsion angle ﬂuctuations from 4 . 0 8 to 16 . 8 8 at 25 8 C ( Table 1 ) . This coﬁlin - induced fourfold increase in h Dx i is independent of the subunit height h , since a is inversely proportional to h ( equation ( 10 ) ) . 19 The 4 8 torsional ﬂuctuation of bare actin ﬁlaments measured here is comparable to the 5 – 6 8 angular disorder observed by electron microscopy image analysis , 26 and more recently using total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence polarization microscopy . 27 Effect of subsaturating phalloidin on coﬁlin binding and ﬁlament dynamics The ability of phalloidin to cooperatively stabilize intermonomer bonds in actin 28 makes it a useful tool to examine the role of intersubunit interactions in the actin – coﬁlin interaction . Saturating phallo - idin has minimal effects on the intensity ( Figure 7 ) and anisotropy ( Figure 7 ( a ) inset ) decay of ErIA - actin ﬁlaments , consistent with previous reports . 21 , 29 Saturating amounts of phalloidin protect actin from the coﬁlin - dependent decrease in phosphorescence intensity and anisotropy ( data not shown ) because coﬁlin does not bind phalloidin - stabilized actin . At subsaturating phalloidin concentrations ( 0 . 1 phal - loidin per actin ) , coﬁlin can bind actin and quenches the phosphorescence intensity but mini - mally affects the changes in anisotropy ( Figure 7 ( b ) inset ) . This behavior suggests that coﬁlin binds to phalloidin - free regions on the ﬁlament , locally quenching the phosphorescence of ErIA , but phalloidin - induced long - range stabilizing effects on intermonomer contacts dampen coﬁlin - induced changes in torsional ﬂexibility . The kinetics of coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments was assayed from the quenching of pyrene actin ﬂuorescence . 12 , 30 Time - courses of 11 . 8 m M coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments displayed a brief lag phase ( Figure 7 ( c ) inset ) . For simplicity , we treated the relaxation as a single process even though this is not an accurate reaction mechanism 30 ( E . D . L . C . and W . Cao , unpublished results ) . The observed time - course of coﬁlin ( 11 . 8 m M ) binding to actin could be approximated by an exponential with an observed rate constant of w 1 . 6 s K 1 . Time - courses of coﬁlin binding to phalloidin - stabilized actin ﬁlaments follow double exponentials ( Figure 7 ( c ) inset ) . Bound phalloidin slowed the observed rate con - stant of the fast phase and subsaturating phalloidin concentrations generated maximal inhibition ( Figure 7 ( c ) ) . The best ﬁt of the data ( Figure 7 ( c ) ) indicates that a single bound phalloidin inhibits coﬁlin binding to 8 . 6 G 0 . 5 actin subunits in a ﬁlament . This inhibition can be explained by the stabilizing effect of phalloidin , which extends 10 – 20 ﬁlament subunits . 28 The observed rate constants of the slow phases are 0 . 002 – 0 . 01 s K 1 , which may be limited by phalloidin dissociation . Contributions from photobleaching make it difﬁcult to analyze the slow rates reliably . Discussion Relationship between phosphorescence intensity , anisotropy and the conformation of ErIA - actin ﬁlaments The analysis of the effect of coﬁlin on phosphor - escence intensity and anisotropy of ErIA - actin indicates that coﬁlin has both local and long - range effects on actin’s structure and dynamics . Coﬁlin - induced local structural changes in the environment of the C terminus are indicated by quenching of the phosphorescence intensity of actin - bound ErIA ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . These changes are probably facilitated by the proximity ( 11 – 30 A˚ ) of coﬁlin binding sites to the label on Cys374 . 5 The subtle effect of coﬁlin on the absorption and emission dipoles of ErIA - actin ﬁlaments ( Table 1 ) suggests that its binding occurs with minimal ( ! 10 8 ) tilting of the ErIA probe with respect to the ﬁlament axis , but the observed decrease in phosphorescence intensity suggests structural changes in the environ - ment of Cys374 that increase the exposure of the actin - bound ErIA to quenching by the solvent . Increased exposure of the dye to the solvent is also supported by the increased amplitude of the nanosecond wobbling motions , which are too fast for the motions of whole monomers , but are Table 1 .

These local coﬁlin - induced structural changes could contribute to the reported changes at the interface between subdomain 1 and 2 9 of adjacent ﬁlament subunits , and because of confor - mational coupling between subdomain 1 and 2 31 within an individual subunit , to changes in subdomain 2 conformation . 7 It has been proposed that coﬁlin binding shifts the equilibrium distribution of thermal confor - mers . 6 , 7 The reciprocal , [ coﬁlin ] - dependent par - titioning of the short and long phosphorescence lifetime conformational states ( Figure 3 ) is con - sistent with this hypothesis . However , the coﬁlin - induced increase in torsional amplitude between adjacent ﬁlament subunits ( h Dx i ; Table 1 ) suggests that coﬁlin binding also allows actin ﬁlaments to sample novel conformational states by changing the ﬁlament torsional stiffness . In contrast , coﬁlin markedly reduces the variability in subunit torsion angles observed by electron microscopy . 6 This observation suggests that electron microscopy is sampling the long - range cumulative component of the angular variability , while the spectroscopic measurements report the local rotations of an actin subunit or domain about the helical axis . The coﬁlin - induced cooperative change in phos - phorescence anisotropy and the large decrease in torsional rigidity are likely to reﬂect the change in ﬁlament twist . Differential scanning calorimetry 32 favors a mechanism where coﬁlin binding destabilizes ( i . e . lowers the thermal transition ) the ﬁlament lattice cooperatively , as would be expected from the increased torsional ﬂexibility at sub - stoichiometric coﬁlin concentrations . Our spectro - scopic observations are also consistent with the results of electron microscopy , which showed that coﬁlin cooperatively changes the twist of the actin ﬁlament . 6 The binding of coﬁlin induces long - range cooperative changes in the microsecond timescale actin ﬁlament dynamics ( Figure 5 ) . The non - nearest - neighbor effects on torsional dynamics may contribute to the acceleration of P i 33 release and weak P i binding of coﬁlin - actin ﬁlaments , and may inﬂuence interaction with other regulatory proteins , particularly those that are sensitive to the nucleotide state of actin ﬁlaments such as the Arp2 / 3 complex . 34 Long - range cooperative changes in actin ﬁla - ments are expected to decrease ( i . e . dampen ) as the distance from bound coﬁlin increases . The number of subunits that could be affected would be dictated by the energy change of the two twisted confor - mations and the energy associated with coﬁlin binding . The product of the number of affected subunits and the free energy change of the transition could not exceed the free energy associ - ated with coﬁlin binding . Therefore , the observation that dozens of subunits are affected by an individual coﬁlin molecule favors a mechanism Figure 7 .

Coﬁlin Affects Actin Filament Torsional Dynamics 995 where the twist conformations are comparable in energy , perhaps thermal conformers . Comparison of methods used to measure the torsional rigidity of actin ﬁlaments Several methods have been used to estimate the angular disorder in the torsion angle between adjacent ﬁlament subunits ( h Dx i ) and the torsional rigidity ( C ) of actin ﬁlaments , including electron microscopy , 24 , 35 , 36 electron paramagnetic resonance , 37 , 38 transient absorption and phos - phorescence anisotropy , 15 , 16 , 18 – 21 visualization of rotational motions of beads attached to actin ﬁlaments , 39 , 40 and total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence polarization microscopy . 27 The values for the torsional rigidity of actin ﬁlaments obtained with these methods range from w 2 ! 10 K 27 Nm 2 15 , 16 , 18 – 21 , 24 , 27 , 35 – 38 to w 5 ! 10 K 26 Nm 2 . 39 , 40 This study estimates the torsional rigidity of actin ﬁlaments in solution as 2 . 3 ! 10 K 27 Nm 2 ( Table 1 ) , comparable to previous spec - troscopy , 15 , 16 , 18 – 21 , 37 , 38 electron microscopy 24 , 35 , 36 and single - molecule measurements . 27 Higher values were obtained with micromanipulation methods , using large beads in an optical trap , 39 , 40 which more than likely lead to an overestimate of torsional rigidity . 27 Implications for actin ﬁlament severing The observed local changes at the actin C terminus may account for the effect of coﬁlin on actin ﬁlament stability . Normal mode analysis of the actin ﬁlament led to the conclusion that the torsional ﬂexibility of the whole ﬁlament could be signiﬁcantly affected by reorientation of only a few residues , such as in the region of the hydrophobic plug and subdomain 2 ; 23 , 41 – 43 such torsionally strained ﬁlaments fragment more easily than unloaded ﬁlaments . 39 Coﬁlin binding to the C terminus of actin would interfere with formation of stabilizing longitudinal contacts established by subdomains 1 and 2 of adjacent subunits . 5 – 7 , 9 , 23 , 28 , 44 , 45 Because subdomain 2 also forms lateral interstrand contactsthroughcontactwithresidues 262 – 274 , 23 , 46 , 47 reorganization of subdomain 2 upon coﬁlin bind - ing 7 , 8 would disrupt the formation of stabilizing lateral 10 , 11 ﬁlament interactions as well . By destabilizing subdomain 2 interactions in the ﬁlament , coﬁlin makes the overall intersubunit contacts less stiff . Thus , coﬁlin serves as a molecular lubricant that allows actin ﬁlaments to adopt otherwise inaccessible conformations . The combi - nation of compromised lateral and longitudinal ﬁlament contacts would , therefore , destabilize the ﬁlament locally and promote severing . The increase in the torsional ﬂexibility of coﬁlin - actin ﬁlaments ( i . e . lower torsional constant , a , Table 1 ) and larger intersubunit angular disorder ( h Dx i , Table 1 ) is consistent with proposed coﬁlin - induced disruption of longitudinal and lateral interactions in actin . It is , therefore , likely that the increased angular disorder ( h Dx i ) induced by coﬁlin binding causes local perturbations in ﬁlament conformation and dynamics that promote severing . Such a mechanism would account for efﬁcient ﬁlament severing at low coﬁlin binding densities and cluster sizes . 12 The observed effects of phalloidin provide further insight into the mechanism of coﬁlin - induced local and global changes in actin ﬁlament . Phalloidin binding changes the conformation of subdomain 2 cooperatively , 28 dampens the coﬁlin - dependent torsional dynamics of actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 7 ( b ) ) , has long - range effects stabilizing intermonomer bonds , and cooperatively decreases the rate of coﬁlin binding ( Figure 7 ( c ) ) , supporting our hypothesis that the coﬁlin binding afﬁnity is dictated by the conformation of subdomain 2 as well as actin ﬁlament torsional dynamics . 12 Signiﬁ - cant quenching of phosphorescence without bind - ing - related changes in dynamics , as observed at substoichiometric concentrations of phalloidin ( Figure 7 ( b ) ) further suggests that the mechanism of long - range effects of coﬁlin on actin’s dynamics involves destabilization of intermonomer bonds . Comparison with other actin - binding proteins The observed effect of coﬁlin on the microsecond dynamics of actin represents another example of cooperative changes in actin ﬁlaments induced by interaction with regulatory proteins . Both gelsolin 15 and myosin subfragment 1 16 cooperatively affect the conformation and dynamics of actin ﬁlaments . Although each of these proteins affects the environ - ment of the actin C terminus , the changes in TPA and dynamics are distinct ( i . e . myosin increases but coﬁlin and gelsolin lower the torsional rigidity ) , indicating that the changes are speciﬁc to the structure of the binding interfaces . Materials and Methods Proteins Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was puriﬁed as described . 19 , 48 Recombinant human coﬁlin was expressed and puriﬁed as described . 12 , 49 All proteins were dialyzed exhaustively against KMI 6 . 6 buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM NaN 3 , 20 mM imidazole ( pH 6 . 6 ) ) prior to use . Labeling of actin with optical probes Actin ( 48 m M ) was polymerized with 50 mM KCl , 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , and ErIA , freshly dissolved in dimethylformamide , was added at a concentration of 480 m M . After 2 h incubation at 25 8 C , the labeling reaction was quenched with 5 mM DTT , actin ﬁlaments were centrifuged for 1 h at 200 , 000 g , pellets were suspended in G buffer and clariﬁed by centrifugation at 350 , 000 g . Samples were polymerized with 0 . 1 M KCl and centri - fuged for 1 h at 200 , 000 g . Pellets were suspended and dialyzed against KMI 6 . 6 buffer without magnesium . 996 Coﬁlin Affects Actin Filament Torsional Dynamics Pyrene actin was prepared essentially as described . 12 The labeling efﬁciencies were R 90 % . Phosphorescence Phosphorescence measurements were made at 25 8 C in KMI 6 . 6 buffer supplemented with an oxygen - scavenging enzyme mixture ( 36 m g ml K 1 catalase , 45 m g ml K 1 glu - cose , 55 m g ml K 1 glucose oxidase ) . Actin ﬁlaments and coﬁlin - actin ﬁlaments were prepared by mixing pre - formed eryhrosine - labeled ( ErIA ) actin ﬁlaments with a range of coﬁlin concentrations and equilibrated at room temperature for at least 20 min . ErIA was excited at 540 nm with a vertically polarized 10 ns pulse from XeCl - pumped dye laser ( Compex 120 , Lambda Physics ) using 5 mM coumarin 548 in ethanol , operating at a repetition rate of 100 Hz . Phosphorescence emission was selected by a colored glass cut - off 670 nm ﬁlter ( Corion ) , detected by a photomultiplier ( R928 , Hamamatsu ) , and digitized by a transient digitizer ( CompuScope 14100 , GaGe ) using time resolution of 1 m s / channel , with an analog ﬁlter time constant of 3 m s . The time - resolved phosphorescence intensity I ( t ) and anisotropy decays r ( t ) were calculated according to : I ð t Þ Z I vv ð t Þ C 2 GI vh ð t Þ ( 1 ) and r ð t Þ Z I vv ð t Þ K GI vh ð t Þ I vv ð t Þ C 2 GI vh ð t Þ ( 2 ) where I vv ( t ) and I vh ( t ) are vertically and horizontally polarized components of the emission signal that were detected at 90 8 with a single detector equipped with a Polaroid sheet polarizer alternating between vertical and horizontal orientations every 500 laser pulses . G is an instrumentation correction factor , determined by measuring the anisotropy of ErIA - labeled bovine serum albumin in 98 % glycerol and adjusting G to give a residual anisotropy value of zero , the theoretical value for an isotropically tumbling chromophore . The time - dependent anisotropy decays were obtained by recording 60 cycles of 1000 pulses ( 500 in each orientation of the polarizer ) at a laser repetition rate of 100 Hz . The phosphorescence intensity decays ( I ( t ) ) were analyzed by ﬁtting to a double - exponential : I ð t Þ Z I 1 exp K t = t 1 C I 2 exp K t = t 2 C I 3 ( 3 ) where I i is the amplitude and t i is the triplet excited - state lifetime of the i th relaxation , and t is time . Fits were performed with unconstrained amplitude and lifetime parameters , and then with the lifetimes constrained to the values of F - actin . Mole fractions ( X ) of the observed intensity decays were calculated from : X i Z I i t i I 1 t 1 C I 2 t 2 C I 3 t 3 ( 4 ) The lifetime of the rapidly decaying component ( t 3 ) was assumed to be 1 m s , which is the upper limit , since it is not observed within the 3 m s dead - time for data acquisition ( Figure 2 ) . If the value of t 3 is ! 1 m s , population of X 3 ( Figure 3 ) would be lower . The anisotropy decays ( r ( t ) ) were ﬁtted to double - exponentials ( n Z 2 ) plus a constant ( r N ) : r ð t Þ Z r 1 exp K t = f 1 C r 2 exp K t = f 2 C r N ( 5 ) where r i is the amplitude of the of the i th anisotropy decay , f i is the rotational correlation time of the i th relaxation , and r N is the ﬁnal anisotropy . The initial anisotropy ( r 0 ) is deﬁned as r ( t Z 0 ) . The coﬁlin - induced changes in the initial anisotropy were analyzed in terms of the wobble - in - a - cone model . The isotropic wobble of the observed transition dipole of the probe in a cone was described by the cone half angle q c : 50 r 0 0 : 205 Z cos q c ð 1 C cos q c Þ 2 (cid:1) (cid:2) 2 ( 6 ) where , r 0 Z 0 . 205 for ErIA immobilized in PMMA resin . 19 The anisotropy decays ( r ( t ) ) were further analyzed in terms of the theory of Schurr 51 , 52 describing the rotational diffusion of a ﬂexible ﬁlament with mean local cylindrical symmetry , and applied to TPA of ErIA - actin . 19 According to this model , the ﬁlament is regarded as a randomly labeled array of cylindrical subunits . The anisotropy ( r ( t ) ) describes the mean - squared displacements of the subunit elementary rods ( and the rigidly bound probe ) due to combined intraﬁlament twisting and rigid - body motions of the whole ﬁlament . If the ﬁlaments have a broad length distribution , where each ﬁlament of length l i is composed of N i elementary rods with height h equal to the height of an individual actin subunit , the anisotropy r ( t ) reﬂects the sum of contributions from the ﬁlaments within each particular group : r ð t Þ Z k X n Z 2 n Z 0 X i Z p i Z 1 (cid:1) A n C ni ð t Þ ( 7 ) where k is an “amplitude reduction factor” that accounts for motions on the timescale more rapid than the time resolution of detection , 19 p is the total number of groups in the length distribution histograms ( Figure 6 ) and A¯ n deﬁnes the amplitudes of the motions . The torsional correlation function ( C ni ( t ) ) for ﬁlaments in the length group l i is deﬁned as : 19 C ni ð t Þ Z exp K n 2 tk B T ð N i C 1 Þ g h i N i C 1 !

Note that k B T / g represents the long - axis rotational diffusion coefﬁcient of an elementary rod , commonly referred to as D k . Fitting r ( t ) to equation ( 7 ) with the values of h , a , h , and T constrained yields three parameters : q a and q e , the angles between the absorption and emission dipoles of the bound dye and the ﬁlament axis , respectively , and the torsional constant a , which characterizes the elastic properties of actin and reﬂects the torque force required to twist a 1 m radius ﬁlament by 1 radian ( 57 . 3 8 ) . A larger torsional constant indicates a greater resistance to twisting ( i . e . more stiff ) under applied external rotational forces . The torsional rigidity C is deﬁned by the torsional constant ( a ) and the long - axis height ( h ) of an elementary rod ( i . e . ﬁlament subunit ) as : C Z a h ( 9 ) The root - mean - square average ﬂuctuation of the torsion angle ( h Dx i in radians , 1 rad Z 57 . 3 8 ) between adjacent ﬁlament subunits was calculated from 25 : h Dx i Z ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k B T a r ( 10 ) Equilibrium binding equations The coﬁlin concentration - dependence of the initial ( r 0 ) and ﬁnal ( r N ) anisotropies were ﬁtted to : r obs Z r CA K ð r CA K r A Þð 1 K v Þ n ( 11 ) where r obs is the observed anisotropy ( initial or ﬁnal ) , r A is the anisotropy ( initial or ﬁnal ) of actin alone and r CA is that of a coﬁlin - decorated actin ﬁlament , v is the coﬁlin binding density ( bound coﬁlin per actin ) , and n is the stoichiometry ( molar ratio ) of coﬁlin that maximally affects the r obs of actin ( i . e . number of actin subunits affected by bound coﬁlin ) . Pyrene ﬂuorescence Phalloidin inhibition of coﬁlin binding was assayed from the time - courses of pyrene ﬂuorescence quench - ing 12 , 30 after mixing 11 . 8 m M coﬁlin with 0 . 85 m M pyrene - actin ﬁlaments ( ﬁnal concentrations after mixing ) . Measurements were made at 25 . 0 ( G 0 . 1 ) 8 C in KMI 6 . 6 buffer with an Applied Photophysics SX . 18MV - R stopped - ﬂow apparatus . A 400 nm colored glass emission ﬁlter was used to monitor ﬂuorescence ( l ex Z 366 nm ) . Time - courses of pyrene ﬂuorescence changes were ﬁtted to single or double - exponentials . The phalloidin - concentration - dependence of the fast observed rate constant ( k obs ) of ﬂuorescence quenching was ﬁtted to : k obs Z k o C ð k N K k o Þ ! ½ Ph (cid:7) ½ A (cid:7) C K d ½ A (cid:7) C n (cid:8) (cid:9) K ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ½ Ph (cid:7) ½ A (cid:7) C K d ½ A (cid:7) C n (cid:8) (cid:9) 2 K 4 ½ Ph (cid:7) ½ A (cid:7) n r 2 n 0 BB @ 1 CCA ( 12 ) where k o is the observed rate constant of coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments in the absence of phalloidin , k N ﬂuor - escence intensity is the observed rate constant of coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments in the presence of saturating phalloidin , [ Ph ] and [ A ] are the total phalloidin and actin concentrations respectively , K d is the apparent dis - sociation equilibrium constant of phalloidin binding to rabbit muscle actin ﬁlaments under our experimental conditions ( 20 nM 53 ) , and n is the stoichiometry ( molar ratio ) of bound phalloidin that maximally inhibits coﬁlin binding . The stoichiometry ( n ) , initial ( k o ) and ﬁnal ( k N ) observed rate constants were allowed to ﬂoat when ﬁtting . Electron microscopy Actin ﬁlaments and coﬁlactin ﬁlaments were prepared by mixing preformed erythrosin - labeled actin ﬁlaments with a range of coﬁlin concentrations , equilibrated at room temperature for at least 20 min , adsorbed to glow - discharged carbon - coated copper grids , negatively stained with 1 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate and visualized with a JOEL 100 CX electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV . Cosedimentation Samples ( 200 m l ) of ErIA - F - actin ( 1 . 8 m M ) and coﬁlin ( 0 . 1 , 2 or 8 m M ) were prepared with oxygen - removing enzymes as for TPA experiments . Samples were equili - brated at 25 8 C for 10 min then centrifuged for 30 min at 400 , 000 g in a TLA - 100 rotor , which is sufﬁcient to pellet even very short ﬁlaments ( l avg w 0 . 13 m m ; w 47 subunits ) . 54 The fraction of ErIA - actin remaining in the supernatant was determined by measuring absorbance of the probe at 538 nm of samples before centrifugation and super - natants .
