Experiments and previous approximate theories have suggested that cholesterol incorporated into lipid bilayers has different microscopic effects on lipid - chain packing and conformations and that cholesterol thereby leads to decoupling of the two ordering processes , manifested by a special equilibrium phase , ‘‘liquid - ordered phase , ’’ where bilayers are liquid (cid:126) with transla - tional disorder (cid:33) but lipid chains are conformationally ordered . We present in this paper a microscopic model that describes this decoupling phenomena and which yields a phase diagram consistent with experimental observations . The model is an off - lattice model based on a two - dimensional random triangulation algorithm and represents lipid and cholesterol molecules by hard - core particles with internal (cid:126) spin - type (cid:33) degrees of freedom that have nearest - neighbor interactions . The phase equilibria described by the model , speciﬁcally in terms of phase diagrams and structure factors characterizing different phases , are calculated by using several Monte Carlo simulation techniques , including histogram and thermodynamic reweighting techniques , ﬁnite - size scaling as well as non - Boltzmann sampling techniques (cid:126) in order to overcome severe hysteresis effects associated with strongly ﬁrst - order phase transitions (cid:33) . The results provide a consistent interpretation of the various phases of phospholipid - cholesterol binary mixtures based on the microscopic dual action of cholesterol on the lipid - chain degrees of freedom . In particular , a distinct small - scale structure of the liquid - ordered phase has been identiﬁed and characterized . The generic nature of the model proposed holds a promise for a unifying description for a whole series of different lipid - sterol mixtures .

INTRODUCTION Hydrated bilayers composed of amphiphilic lipid mol - ecules have attracted a remarkable amount of interest from both the biological and the physics communities , because of their biological signiﬁcance as one of the basic architectural components in biological cell membranes , and also because of their physical signiﬁcance as model systems that offer both a richness and a complexity of physical phenomena (cid:64) 1 (cid:35) . From the physical point of view , each monolayer in a lipid bilayer constitutes a two - dimensional (cid:126) 2D (cid:33) system of inter - acting lipid molecules , the hydrocarbon chains of which can be thermally excited to a large number of conformational states . Naturally , a full physical description of a lipid bilayer must involve at least two types of fundamental degrees of freedom intrinsic in the bilayer : translational degrees of free - dom , and ‘‘internal’’ molecular degrees of freedom that cor - respond to the chain conformational states . At the micro - scopic level , the interplay between these two types of degrees of freedom can be clearly and simply deﬁned in terms of speciﬁc microscopic interactions and molecular mechanisms . But at the macroscopic level , the interplay can manifest itself intricately in the ordering processes in a lipid bilayer , depending on the nature of the microscopic interac - tions or the molecular mechanisms . Our previous work (cid:64) 2 (cid:35) concentrated on the issue of how details of microscopic in - teractions affect the macroscopic coupling between the two types of degrees of freedom in models for single - component lipid bilayers . Our present paper continues on the same gen - eral theme of the interplay between the translational and the internal degrees of freedom , but focuses on investigating the effects of introducing into a one - component system a second species of ‘‘model molecules’’ that display a duality in their interactions with the translational and the internal degrees of freedom of the native molecules , mimicking , in fact , the mo - lecular mechanisms of cholesterol molecules in lipid bilayers (cid:126) see below (cid:33) . The existence of two principal thermodynamic phases of a lipid - bilayer system has been well established . These are characterized by different types of macroscopic behavior of both the translational and the chain conformational degrees of freedom : a low - temperature gel phase , which is a 2D solid phase with (cid:126) quasi - (cid:33) long - range translational order and which also has a high degree of collective ordering in chain confor - mations of the lipid molecules in the system , and a high - temperature liquid - crystalline phase , which displays macro - scopic disorder in both the translational (cid:126) as does a liquid (cid:33) and the chain conformational degrees of freedom . Although the common terminology in biophysical literature describes the two phases as the gel phase and the liquid - crystalline phase , we for our purposes label the two phases with so (cid:126) for solid , chain ordered (cid:33) and ld (cid:126) for liquid , chain disordered (cid:33) , respectively . It can be concluded from experimental data that , thermally driven , the translational order and the chain conformational order that are characteristic of the so phase disappear or appear simultaneously at a particular tempera - ture called the temperature of the ‘‘main transition , ’’ in al - most all of the systems of one - component lipid bilayers stud - * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed .

In other words , the translational and the chain conformational degrees of freedom appear macroscopically coupled . However , there are no fundamental physical principles dictating that this macroscopic coupling be the necessary ge - neric feature of the thermodynamic behavior of either two - dimensional systems with both translational and internal de - grees of freedom in general , or lipid bilayers in particular . Indeed , our previous study of minimal models for 2D ran - dom (cid:126) off - lattice (cid:33) Ising systems and one - component lipid bi - layers has shown that it is only a matter of engineering mi - croscopic interactions to macroscopically decouple the two types of degrees of freedom (cid:64) 2 (cid:35) . An intermediate phase does exist as part of the generic phase behavior of systems (cid:126) such as lipid bilayers (cid:33) with both the translational and internal de - grees of freedom : a phase where the (cid:126) quasi - (cid:33) long - range translational order is broken , but where the internal (cid:126) chain conformational (cid:33) degrees of freedom remain macroscopically ordered . We referred to this intermediate phase as the lo (cid:126) for liquid , chain ordered (cid:33) phase . We note here , however , that concrete experimental evidence has yet to be found for the existence of such a phase in one - component lipid bilayers , although some evidence has been found for lipid monolayers (cid:64) 4 (cid:35) . The lo phase has been discovered , however , in bilayer systems of some lipid - cholesterol binary mixtures . Choles - terol is an important molecular constituent of the membranes of eukaryotic cells and it is mostly distributed in the cell plasma membrane . The question of the biological relevance of cholesterol has intrigued many researchers , as evidenced by a large body of both theoretical and experimental work on lipid - cholesterol bilayers and monolayers (cid:64) 5 – 10 (cid:35) , among which we brieﬂy review those that are most relevant to the purpose of our study . The evidence for the existence of the lo phase in bilayers of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (cid:126) DMPC (cid:33) - cholesterol mixtures was ﬁrst given by Needham , McIntosh , and Evans on the basis of their micromechanical measurements (cid:64) 9 (cid:35) . A full phase diagram in terms of choles - terol concentration and temperature was ﬁrmly established for bilayers of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (cid:126) DPPC (cid:33) - cholesterol mixtures by Vist and Davis by combining data from deuterium - NMR , differential scanning calorimetry and electron spin resonance studies (cid:64) 10 (cid:35) . This phase diagram dis - plays a modest depression of the main - transition (cid:126) so - ld (cid:33) tem - perature for low concentrations of cholesterol ; and remark - ably , it demonstrates a macroscopic decoupling of the translational and the chain conformational degrees of free - dom , as manifested by a high - temperature ld - lo coexistence and a low - temperature so - lo coexistence at intermediate con - centrations of cholesterol as well as a single lo phase region at high cholesterol concentrations . Molecular mechanisms underlying the apparent ability of cholesterol to decouple the macroscopic processes of lateral ordering and chain ordering in a lipid bilayer were investi - gated in a theoretical study based on a lattice model (cid:64) 5 (cid:35) . In the model , each lattice site was assigned a multivalued vari - able corresponding to chain conformational states . The phys - ics governing this set of degrees of freedom was described by a multistate (cid:126) Pink (cid:33) model (cid:64) 11 (cid:35) . In addition , a multistate Potts model was employed to give , in a very approximate way , a phenomenological account of the lateral crystalliza - tion (cid:126) ordering (cid:33) process , describing the process only in terms of thermal energetics of the grain boundaries (cid:64) 12 (cid:35) . The ﬁnal essential ingredient of the model was a hypothesis of a dual molecular mechanism of cholesterol : on the one hand , a cho - lesterol molecule acts as an ‘‘ice breaker , ’’ described in the model as a substitutional impurity that weakens the interlipid interactions responsible for crystallization ; on the other hand , the molecule acts as a ‘‘chain rigidiﬁer , ’’ tending to induce its neighboring lipid chains into conformationally ordered states . Calculations based on a mean - ﬁeld theory of the model predicted a phase diagram of DPPC - cholesterol bilay - ers that agreed qualitatively with the experimental phase dia - gram . This model study certainly provided concrete theoret - ical support for the hypothesis and strongly suggested that the lattice model may have captured some of the essence of the microscopic physics governing the thermodynamic phase behavior of lipid - cholesterol bilayers . This model , however , suffers a fundamental shortcoming inherent in the lattice de - scription : the description of the translational degrees of free - dom and the microscopic physics underlying the associated ordering process is not really realistic . Motivated by the phenomenology and the understanding established by the previous experimental and theoretical work on lipid - cholesterol systems , given the context of our previous work of investigating macroscopic interplay be - tween translational and internal degrees of freedom in two - dimensional systems within a minimal model , and equipped with a computer - simulation algorithm that we developed for the purpose of providing a full description of translational degrees of freedom , we have found it natural to extend our previous minimal model for one - component lipid bilayers by including a second species of particles that model the dual molecular mechanism of cholesterol molecules in lipid bilay - ers . Our focus is , therefore , on exploring the generic thermo - dynamic consequences of the cholesterol - like molecular mechanism , in terms of the macroscopic ordering processes associated with the two types of degrees of freedom . In the same spirit of our earlier work , our current model for the cholesterol - like particle is also designed to be minimal , in that it contains a very small number of model parameters , but still reﬂects the dual molecular function of the particle of being both an ‘‘ice breaker’’ and a ‘‘chain rigidiﬁer . ’’ As the results of our study will demonstrate below , certain kinds of our model particles , corresponding to a range of detailed models of their dual - natured coupling to the ‘‘lipid mol - ecules , ’’ do indeed macroscopically decouple the transla - tional and internal degrees of freedom , leading to the sepa - rate appearance of two distinct ordering processes and the existence of a lo - type phase . It is perhaps useful in guiding our presentation and discussion to make note at this point . Although we often refer to the particles in our model as ‘‘lipid molecules’’ and ‘‘cholesterol molecules’’ and to the systems as ‘‘lipid bilayers , ’’ we are fully aware that our de - scriptions of the microscopic properties of our ‘‘model mol - ecules’’ are considerably simpliﬁed pictures of those of real lipid and cholesterol molecules , as our emphasis is on reveal - ing generic physics rather than on providing quantitative in - terpretations for the experiments . And the generic physics we are concerned with should be viewed in a broader context : it may well also be relevant to certain two - dimensional non - lipid systems where both translational and internal molecular PRE 59 5791 OFF - LATTICE MODEL FOR THE PHASE BEHAVIOR OF . . . degrees of freedom are thermodynamically relevant . The plan for the presentation of the rest of the paper is as follows . In Sec . II , we ﬁrst review brieﬂy both the random - lattice algorithm and the essential results from our previous study of the macroscopic coupling between the translational and the chain conformational degrees of freedom in one - component systems . We then give a basic description of the extended microscopic model for a ‘‘lipid - cholesterol’’ bi - layer , which deﬁnes the microscopic interactions between the lipid molecules and between the lipid and cholesterol molecules and highlights the dual function of cholesterol molecules . In Sec . III , we discuss different numerical meth - ods that were used in the Monte Carlo simulations of the extended model , with a particular reference to the use of an effective - Hamiltonian technique that reduces the problems associated with the strong hysteresis frequently encountered in our simulations . In Sec . IV , we present the results of the Monte Carlo simulations of the extended model . These re - sults consist of a detailed ‘‘lipid - cholesterol’’ phase diagram obtained from simulations based on the techniques discussed in Sec . III as well as characterizations of lateral structures in the different thermodynamic phases . Finally , in Sec . V we examine our results in the light of earlier research on lipid - cholesterol systems and discuss their signiﬁcance , in particu - lar , the applicability of the calculated phase diagram . We also propose possible modiﬁcations or extensions of our present model , which may be applied to bilayer systems of binary mixtures of lipids with sterol molecules other than cholesterol . II . MODEL As stated in the preceding section , the microscopic model to be discussed in the present paper is an extension of a model proposed earlier to describe the generic phase behav - ior of single - component lipid bilayers (cid:64) 2 (cid:35) . Hence , we ﬁrst give a summary of the details of that model and the principal results from the computer - simulation study of the model . This earlier model gives a minimal description of the micro - scopic physics governing the phase behavior of lipid bilay - ers , in terms of two different types of fundamental degrees of freedom—the internal degrees of freedom representing chain conformations and the translational degrees of freedom de - scribing the positions of the particles . Two distinct states form the phase space of each conformational variable : an ordered (cid:126) o (cid:33) state , corresponding to an all - trans conﬁguration , and a disordered (cid:126) d (cid:33) state , modeling excited states where lipid chains become conformationally disordered due to trans - gauche isomerization . The ordered state is a nondegen - erate ground state while the disordered state is characterized by an excitation energy and a high degeneracy representing the large number of possible conformational states of trans - gauche isomerizations (cid:64) 13 (cid:35) . A genuine representation of the conﬁguration space associated with the translational vari - ables is achieved through a specially designed 2D random - lattice simulation algorithm . A brief description of this algo - rithm will be given in Sec . III . The two types of degrees of freedom are microscopically coupled through pairwise interaction potentials , which de - pend on both the conformational states and the interparticle distance of two interacting particles . Explicitly , the following Hamiltonian deﬁnes the microscopic model : H 0 (cid:53) (cid:40) i E d L id (cid:49) (cid:40) (cid:94) i (cid:44) j (cid:38) V o - o (cid:126) R (cid:33) L io L jo (cid:49) (cid:80) A . (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) Here (cid:94) i (cid:44) j (cid:38) denotes a summation over nearest neighbors and i is an index labeling the particles in the system . L id and L io are occupation variables that are unity when the i th particle is in the ordered and the disordered states , respectively , and zero otherwise . E d is the excitation energy of the disordered conformational state and V o - o ( R ) is a distance - dependent in - teraction potential between two neighboring particles that are both in the ordered state . (cid:80) is , in effect , a lateral surface pressure stabilizing the system against lateral expansion and A is the total area of the system . The interaction potential V o - o ( R ) is composed of a hard - core repulsive potential and two attractive square - well potentials , as illustrated in Fig . 1 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , being a simple model of a realistic short - range molecu - lar interaction . The main results of our previous simulation study of this model are summarized in Fig . 2 , a phase diagram given in terms of temperature and a parameter V 0 / J 0 measuring the relative strength of the two square - well attractions . The point of key importance in this phase diagram is the appearance of two distinct regimes , separated by a triple point , of different types of macroscopic interplay between the two types of de - grees of freedom . A regime of macroscopic coupling be - tween the two types of degrees of freedom , as observed in most systems of pure lipid bilayers , exists for values of V 0 / J 0 greater than the triple - point value ; however , a regime of macroscopic decoupling also exists as part of the generic thermodynamic behavior of the model , for values of V 0 / J 0 smaller than the triple - point value , where two distinct order - ing transitions take place successively , separated by an inter - mediate lo phase . In order to highlight the inﬂuence of the cholesterol - like molecular mechanism as proposed in the In - troduction , we choose in the present paper to concentrate on the regime where the two sets of degrees of freedom are macroscopically coupled in the absence of cholesterol . Based upon the model and the physics described above , a minimal model , which describes a system containing both lipid chain particles and cholesterol molecules , can be built by adding additional microscopic interaction terms to the Hamiltonian in Eq . (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) : H (cid:53) H 0 (cid:49) H o - d (cid:49) H o - c (cid:49) H d - c (cid:49) H c - c . (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) Here H o - d , H o - c , H d - c , and H c - c , as indicated by the differ - ent subscripts , represent the pairwise interaction potentials between an ordered chain and a disordered chain , an ordered chain and a cholesterol molecule , a disordered chain and a cholesterol molecule , and two cholesterol molecules , respec - tively ; they are deﬁned as follows : H o - d (cid:53) (cid:40) (cid:94) i (cid:44) j (cid:38) V o - d (cid:126) R ij (cid:33) (cid:36) L io L jd (cid:49) L jo L id (cid:37) , H o - c (cid:53) (cid:40) (cid:94) i (cid:44) j (cid:38) V o - c (cid:126) R ij (cid:33) (cid:36) L io L jc (cid:49) L jo L ic (cid:37) , (cid:126) 3 (cid:33) 5792 PRE 59 NIELSEN , MIAO , IPSEN , ZUCKERMANN , AND MOURITSEN H d - c (cid:53) (cid:40) (cid:94) i (cid:44) j (cid:38) V d - c (cid:126) R ij (cid:33) (cid:36) L id L jc (cid:49) L jd L ic (cid:37) , H c - c (cid:53) (cid:40) (cid:94) i (cid:44) j (cid:38) V c - c (cid:126) R ij (cid:33) (cid:36) L ic L jc (cid:37) , where an additional occupation variables L ic is introduced to account for the presence of the cholesterol molecules in the system . L ic is unity if the i th particle is a cholesterol mol - ecule and is zero otherwise . The energy of interaction be - tween two chains both in the disordered state is set to zero . For completeness , the model of Eq . (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) includes a term for the interaction between an ordered and a disordered lipid chain . This term was not included in the Hamiltonian in Eq . (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) since it has no importance for the generic phase behavior of the model . Reﬂecting our strategy of performing minimal modeling , the additional microscopic interactions , V o - c ( R ) , V d - c ( R ) , V c - c ( R ) , and V o - d ( R ) , are each approximated , similarly as V o - o ( R ) in H 0 , by a sum of a hard - core repulsive potential of range d , a short - range square - well potential V s ( R ) , V s (cid:126) R (cid:33) (cid:53) (cid:72) (cid:50) V s , d (cid:44) R (cid:60) R 0 0 otherwise , (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) and a longer - range attractive square - well potential V l ( R ) , V l (cid:126) R (cid:33) (cid:53) (cid:72) (cid:50) V l , d (cid:44) R (cid:60) l max 0 otherwise . (cid:126) 5 (cid:33) Some of the microscopic interactions are sketched in Fig . 1 to illustrate our speciﬁc way of modeling the dual molecular function of a cholesterol molecule . A comparison of Fig . 1 (cid:126) a (cid:33) and Fig . 1 (cid:126) b (cid:33) illustrates the ‘‘ice - breaker’’ mechanism , as the interactions involved imply that a cholesterol molecule dis - solved in an ordered - chain environment tends to have a larger surface area than that of a lipid chain , thus disrupting the lateral packing of the ordered chains . Similarly , a com - parison of Fig . 1 (cid:126) b (cid:33) and Fig . 1 (cid:126) c (cid:33) makes the ‘‘chain - rigidiﬁer’’ mechanism clear , as the given interactions simply mean that a cholesterol molecule prefers its neighboring chains to be in the conformationally ordered state . III . SIMULATION METHODS Before presenting the numerical results obtained from the simulation studies of the microscopic model of Eq . (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) we describe the statistical mechanical formulation of the prob - FIG . 2 . Phase diagram for the model of the pure lipid bilayer system .

Chains in the dis - ordered state are plotted as ( (cid:115) ) and chains in the ordered chain state as ( (cid:100) ) .

The ratio R 0 / d is chosen so that R o - c / R o - o (cid:39) 1 . 3 , making the average surface area of the cholesterol molecules about 30 % larger than that of the lipid chains in the ordered state . PRE 59 5793 OFF - LATTICE MODEL FOR THE PHASE BEHAVIOR OF . . . lem in terms of thermodynamic ensembles and simulation procedures , and discuss in some detail the simulation meth - ods that have been employed in order to establish a coherent picture of the thermodynamic behavior of the model . The system under consideration consists of a total number of N particles , including both ‘‘lipid’’ and ‘‘cholesterol’’ particles . All simulations performed used the Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm (cid:64) 14 (cid:35) , for ﬁxed N , T , and surface pres - sure (cid:80) . Two different thermodynamic ensembles have been used regarding the molecular composition of the system : (cid:126) a (cid:33) a semigrand canonical ensemble , in which the number of ‘‘cholesterol’’ particles is controlled by a parameter (cid:109) (cid:68) rep - resenting the difference between the chemical potentials of ‘‘lipid’’ and ‘‘cholesterol’’ particles , and , therefore , ﬂuctu - ates and (cid:126) b (cid:33) a canonical ensemble , in which the number of ‘‘cholesterol’’ particles , i . e . , the ‘‘cholesterol’’ concentration x c is ﬁxed . The two formulations are complementary to each other . The simulations formulated based on the semigrand canonical ensemble straightforwardly (cid:126) at least in principle (cid:33) yield as functions of T and (cid:109) (cid:68) equilibrium probability dis - tributions for relevant quantities such as the ‘‘cholesterol’’ concentration . Hence , the phase diagram of the system , both in the ( (cid:109) (cid:68) , T ) representation and in the ( x c , T ) , can be unambiguously obtained from the probability distributions . Our simulation algorithm must explore the entire phase space of the system , which is a superposition of the subspace spanned by the translational degrees of freedom and that spanned by the conformational degrees of freedom as well as , when the semigrand canonical ensemble is used , the sub - space associated with compositional ﬂuctuations . Accessing the phase space associated with the conformational degrees of freedom is straightforward as it only involves random updating of conformational states of all ‘‘lipid’’ particles . Similarly , compositional ﬂuctuations are represented by ran - dom attempts to exchange each particle in the system with a particle from either of the ‘‘lipid’’ and ‘‘cholesterol’’ reser - voirs . The nonconventional element of our simulation algo - rithm is a random - lattice algorithm developed to deal with the translational degrees of freedom (cid:64) 2 (cid:35) . The details concern - ing the implementation of this random - lattice algorithm have been published in Ref . (cid:64) 2 (cid:35) ; only the essentials are given here . The algorithm employs a network (cid:126) random - lattice (cid:33) represen - tation of spatial conﬁgurations of a 2D dense system of many particles and generates the phase space of spatial conﬁgura - tions by performing three basic steps : (cid:126) a (cid:33) movements of the particles , (cid:126) b (cid:33) changes in local connectivity of the network , and (cid:126) c (cid:33) changes in the overall area of the system . The com - bination of steps (cid:126) a (cid:33) and (cid:126) b (cid:33) ensures the occurrence of both lateral diffusion of the particles and ﬂuctuations in local par - ticle distributions (cid:126) local densities (cid:33) that are the necessary manifestations of the translational invariance inherent in any general microscopic description of a 2D liquid system and step (cid:126) c (cid:33) allows for changes in global density of the system . In order to ensure detailed balance in the simulations , or the symmetry of the Markov chain generated by the algorithm , all of the different updating procedures have been combined in a random manner . In other words , the simulation algo - rithm does not impose any preferred sequential order in the procedures that update different types of degrees of freedom (cid:64) 15 (cid:35) . One complete Monte Carlo step (cid:126) MCS (cid:33) , a time unit for the simulations , is deﬁned to be the time needed to perform on average one complete pass through steps (cid:126) a (cid:33) , (cid:126) b (cid:33) , and (cid:126) c (cid:33) , and one complete run through changing the molecular type or conformational state of each particle in the system . A straightforward implementation of the updating proce - dures outlined in the previous paragraph leads to a serious difﬁculty when investigating the thermodynamic transitions between different phases , especially the transitions between so and ld phases . The difﬁculty is essentially due to the presence of a very strong hysteresis . There are several rea - sons underlying the strong hysteresis . A simulated process during which the system passes through a region of barrier between two coexisting equilibrium phases corresponds to a sequence of concerted simulation steps . However , each simulation step in the algorithm involves only a single mol - ecule and small variations in microscopic conﬁgurations , or the microscopic energy of the system . Given the already large phase space associated with a single molecule and an increase in the microscopic energy corresponding to the bar - rier height , each step in the barrier - crossing sequence can only be tried with a small probability p 0 and realized with an even smaller probability p 0 e (cid:50) (cid:98)(cid:68) E 1 , where (cid:68) E 1 here repre - sents the energy increase in a single simulation step . Cross - ing a high or even modest energy barrier , (cid:68) E , therefore im - plies a very long sequence of simulation steps and is dictated by a total probability of roughly ( p 0 ) M e (cid:50) (cid:98)(cid:68) E . This probabil - ity is clearly rendered very small by the large number of steps in the sequence M . For a modest height of an energy barrier of 4 k B T , one barrier crossing from an so state to an ld state requires typically 10 7 MCS’s for a system of linear size L (cid:53) 12 . This difﬁculty makes it practically impossible to re - liably identify phase transitions . Part of the difﬁculty , which is due to a very small ( p 0 ) M , is inherent in the algorithm and , therefore , cannot be re - moved unless some special algorithms are designed and used . However , the part of the difﬁculty that arises from the energy barrier can be overcome by employing certain tech - niques . We have used simulation techniques based on a modiﬁed Hamiltonian . This method exploits the idea of de - veloping an ‘‘artiﬁcial’’ Hamiltonian that yields a consider - ably diminished energy barrier . The equilibrium distribution functions for the original Hamiltonian can then be estab - lished from the alternative simulations of the modiﬁed Hamiltonian through a simple reweighting relation . This method can be considered as a generalization of other Monte Carlo sampling schemes such as the multicanonical - ensemble scheme (cid:64) 16 (cid:35) . For a complete discussion of the method and related references , the reader is referred to Ref . (cid:64) 17 (cid:35) . In our simulation study of the microscopic model , Eq . (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) , this method has been implemented in simulations performed within the semigrand canonical ensemble . One of the most important equilibrium distribution functions is P ( T , (cid:109) (cid:68) ; (cid:171) , x c ) , where T and (cid:109) (cid:68) are the thermodynamic con - trol parameters , and (cid:171)(cid:91) E / N and x c are the energy per par - ticle and cholesterol concentration , respectively . A corre - sponding spectral free - energy function can now be deﬁned as F ( (cid:171) , x c ) (cid:53)(cid:50) k B T ln P ( (cid:171) , x c ) , which displays a barrier when coexistence conditions corresponding to special values of T and (cid:109) (cid:68) are approached . Given an original Hamiltonian H , a 5794 PRE 59 NIELSEN , MIAO , IPSEN , ZUCKERMANN , AND MOURITSEN natural candidate for a modiﬁed Hamiltonian can have the following functional form , H¯ (cid:53) H (cid:49) f (cid:126) (cid:171) (cid:33) , (cid:126) 6 (cid:33) where f ( (cid:171) ) , known as the shape function , must be chosen in such a way that the spectral free - energy function correspond - ing to the modiﬁed Hamiltonian shows no signiﬁcant barrier , as described below . Straightforward simulations of the modi - ﬁed Hamiltonian yield a modiﬁed probability distribution function , P ¯ ( (cid:171) , x c ) , which , when normalized , has a simple relationship to the original P ( (cid:171) , x c ) , P ¯ (cid:126) (cid:171) , x c (cid:33) (cid:53) P (cid:126) (cid:171) , x c (cid:33) e (cid:50) (cid:98) f ( (cid:171) ) (cid:40) (cid:171) (cid:56) , x c (cid:56) P (cid:126) (cid:171) (cid:56) , x c (cid:56) (cid:33) e (cid:50) (cid:98) f ( (cid:171) (cid:56) ) . (cid:126) 7 (cid:33) P ( (cid:171) , x c ) is hence easily established from P ¯ ( (cid:171) , x c ) , based on the above equation and the normalization of P ¯ ( (cid:171) , x c ) : P (cid:126) (cid:171) , x c (cid:33) (cid:53) P ¯ (cid:126) (cid:171) , x c (cid:33) e (cid:98) f ( (cid:171) ) (cid:40) (cid:171) (cid:56) , x c (cid:56) P ¯ (cid:126) (cid:171) (cid:56) , x c (cid:56) (cid:33) e (cid:98) f ( (cid:171) (cid:56) ) , (cid:126) 8 (cid:33) which leads to P (cid:126) x c (cid:33) (cid:53) (cid:40) (cid:171) (cid:56) P (cid:126) (cid:171) (cid:56) , x c (cid:33) , P (cid:126) (cid:171) (cid:33) (cid:53) (cid:40) x c (cid:56) P (cid:126) (cid:171) (cid:56) , x c (cid:33) . (cid:126) 9 (cid:33) A judicious choice for f ( (cid:171) ) requires some prior knowl - edge of the original spectral function F ( (cid:171) ) (cid:53)(cid:50) k B T ln P ( (cid:171) ) ; such knowledge can be obtained from simulations of systems of very small sizes . Establishing the phase diagram , espe - cially the loci of phase coexistence , needs sufﬁcient data from systematic simulations of systems of larger sizes . Itera - tion of a ﬁve - step procedure accomplishes the task : (cid:126) i (cid:33) At values of T and (cid:109) (cid:68) estimated to be close to true coexistence conditions , an initial estimate of F ( (cid:171) ) is ob - tained from a simulation of a system of a relatively small size L governed by the original Hamiltonian H , and is de - noted F L ( (cid:171) ) . (cid:126) ii (cid:33) An extrapolation based on the size dependence of the energy barrier is used to approximate the barrier of a system of a larger size L (cid:56) and in turn , the shape function : f (cid:126) (cid:171) (cid:33) (cid:53)(cid:50) F L (cid:56) (cid:126) (cid:171) (cid:33) (cid:53)(cid:50) L (cid:56) L F L (cid:126) (cid:171) (cid:33) , (cid:126) 10 (cid:33) when (cid:171) lies in the barrier region . f ( (cid:171) ) then deﬁnes the modi - ﬁed Hamiltonian , which is used in a second simulation of a system of size L (cid:56) . From this simulation , the modiﬁed prob - ability distribution function , P ¯ L (cid:56) ( (cid:171) , x c ) , is obtained . (cid:126) iii (cid:33) P L (cid:56) ( (cid:171) , x c ) is reconstructed from P ¯ L (cid:56) ( (cid:171) , x c ) by use of Eq . (cid:126) 8 (cid:33) . (cid:126) iv (cid:33) Based on P L (cid:56) ( (cid:171) , x c ) , the Ferrenberg - Swendsen re - weighting technique (cid:64) 18 (cid:35) is applied in order to obtain a better estimate of the coexistence condition and an improved ap - proximation of F ( (cid:171) ) at the coexistence by F L (cid:56) ( (cid:171) ) . (cid:126) v (cid:33) If desired , another iteration is started from step (cid:126) ii (cid:33) with F L (cid:56) ( (cid:171) ) , either to obtain an improved statistical sam - pling of F L (cid:56) ( (cid:171) , x c ) for the same system size or to simulate a larger system . In the simulations , a system in a laterally disordered state is prepared at a high temperature . The system is then quenched to the temperature of coexistence corresponding to a given value of (cid:109) (cid:68) . After a sufﬁciently long period of equilibration , typically 200 000 MCS’s , when the system has relaxed to a thermodynamic equilibrium state , the probability distribution function P ¯ ( (cid:171) , x c ) is sampled over a period of ( 10 – 200 ) (cid:51) 10 6 MCS’s . The method enables us to simulate systems of relatively large sizes and to study the systematic convergence towards the thermodynamic limit of the ﬁnite - size thermodynamic behavior of the physical model Hamil - tonian . Though , the method is still quite time consuming . In the iterations , the system size can only be increased in very small steps ; the statistics required to obtain the initial esti - mate of the spectral free - energy function F as described in step (cid:126) i (cid:33) is already considerable , being typically of the order of 50 (cid:51) 10 6 MCS’s per particle for a system of size L (cid:53) 10 . We have also performed a limited number of simulations within the canonical ensemble in order to obtain complemen - tary results for the phase behavior of the model . The simu - lations based on the canonical ensemble formulation , where cholesterol concentration is one of the thermodynamic con - trol parameters and thus ﬁxed , are done in the following manner . The system is prepared in a high - temperature liquid state as described above , with a ﬁxed number of cholesterol molecules randomly distributed throughout the system . The system is then quenched to the lower temperature and equili - brated over a period of 200 000 MCS’s and the various ther - modynamical quantities are then measured over a period of 5 – 20 (cid:51) 10 6 MCS’s . In the simulations we have calculated a number of quantities including the following structure fac - tors , S T (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:53) 1 N (cid:36) (cid:94) (cid:114) T (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:114) T (cid:126) (cid:50) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:38) (cid:50) (cid:94) (cid:114) T (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:38) 2 (cid:100) q (cid:87) , 0 (cid:87) (cid:37) , S O (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:53) 1 N (cid:36) (cid:94) (cid:114) O (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:114) O (cid:126) (cid:50) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:38) (cid:50) (cid:94) (cid:114) O (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:38) 2 (cid:100) q (cid:87) , 0 (cid:87) (cid:37) , (cid:126) 11 (cid:33) S C (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:53) 1 N (cid:36) (cid:94) (cid:114) C (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:114) C (cid:126) (cid:50) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:38) (cid:50) (cid:94) (cid:114) C (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:38) 2 (cid:100) q (cid:87) , 0 (cid:87) (cid:37) , S O - C (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:53) 1 N (cid:36) (cid:94) (cid:114) O (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:114) C (cid:126) (cid:50) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:49) (cid:114) C (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:114) O (cid:126) (cid:50) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:38) (cid:50) 2 (cid:94) (cid:114) O (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:114) C (cid:126) q (cid:87) (cid:33) (cid:38) (cid:100) q (cid:87) , 0 (cid:87) (cid:37) .

SIMULATION RESULTS In this section , we describe in terms of thermodynamic phase diagrams and observables the generic thermodynamic behavior of the minimal model deﬁned in Eq . (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) , established from systematic simulations described in the preceding sec - tion . The principal thermodynamic control parameters are the temperature T , and either the global cholesterol concen - tration , x c , or (cid:109) (cid:68) , the effective chemical potential control - ling equilibrium cholesterol concentration . We deﬁne x c (cid:53) N c / N , where N is the total number of particles in the sys - tem and N c is the number of cholesterol molecules . This deﬁnition is related to the molar fraction x cm commonly used in experimental work as x cm (cid:53) 2 x c / ( 1 (cid:49) x c ) , since each lipid molecule contains two chains . The rest of the parameters in the model are ﬁxed at speciﬁc values in all simulations . For convenience , the unit for energy is chosen to be J 0 (cid:91) V o - o l , which is the strength of the longer - range attraction between chains in the ordered state , as deﬁned by Eq . (cid:126) 5 (cid:33) . The unit for lengths is set by the hard - core diameter d . Thus , the surface pressure (cid:80) is ﬁxed at (cid:80) d 2 / J 0 (cid:53) 6 . 0 . The excitation energy of the disordered state of lipid chains is chosen as E d (cid:53) 1 . 303 J 0 , and the degeneracy of the same state D d is taken to be ln D d (cid:53) 7 . 2 . The parameters deﬁning the interaction po - tentials as in Eq . (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) and Eq . (cid:126) 5 (cid:33) are set at the following speciﬁc values : V o - o s (cid:53) 1 . 55 J 0 , V o - c l (cid:53) 2 . 45 J 0 , V o - c s (cid:53)(cid:50) 1 . 75 J 0 , V d - c l (cid:53) 0 . 35 J 0 , V d - c s (cid:53)(cid:50) 0 . 35 J 0 , V c - c l (cid:53) 0 . 5 J 0 , V c - c s (cid:53)(cid:50) 1 . 0 J 0 , V o - d l (cid:53) 0 . 5 J 0 , and V o - d s (cid:53)(cid:50) 0 . 5 J 0 . The radius of the short - range square - well potential was R 0 / d (cid:53) 1 . 3 . The values of (cid:80) , R 0 , E d , and ln D d are chosen so that the latent heat of the main transition and change in surface area across the main transition are comparable to that measured experi - mentally for the single - component DPPC bilayer system (cid:64) 19 (cid:35) . The value for V o - o s is chosen such that the phase tran - sition in the pure ‘‘lipid system’’ is located in the regime where the translational and the internal degrees of freedom are coupled (cid:126) see discussion in Sec . II (cid:33) . Other parameters , V (cid:97) - c s , l ( (cid:97) (cid:53) o , l , c ) are also set at certain values , so that the phase behavior predicted by the model resembles that of the DPPC - cholesterol bilayer . Note that the values given above for the parameters are those used for the results quoted in the following . These values , however , are not unique in that the same generic phase behavior holds for a large set of different parameter values . A . Phase diagrams : simulations within the grand canonical ensemble In order to establish phase diagrams for our model sys - tem , we have performed simulations within the semigrand canonical ensemble , using the simulation methods described in Sec . III . In Fig . 3 are shown the phase diagrams constructed based on our simulation data . Figure 3 (cid:126) a (cid:33) is presented in terms of two control parameters , the global concentration of choles - terol x c and a reduced temperature T / T M , where T M is the temperature of the main transition in the pure lipid system , while Fig . 3 (cid:126) b (cid:33) is a conjugate representation in the parameter space spanned by (cid:109) (cid:68) and T / T M . As clearly illustrated in the phase diagrams , the generic thermodynamic behavior of our model is characterized by three principal phases , an so phase , an ld phase , and an lo phase , as deﬁned in the Introduction , by three ﬁrst - order transitions between these three phases and ﬁnally , by two special points , a critical point , P C , which terminates the ld - lo transition and a triple point P t at which all three phases coexist . In Fig . 4 are shown examples of the ﬁnite - size analysis of the phase coexistence . This ﬁgure shows the spectral free energies F L ( x c ) calculated as a function of the system size L , for two of the three different cases of ﬁrst - order transitions , corresponding to the so - lo and the ld - lo coexistence , respec - tively . In each case , a value of T is chosen and kept ﬁxed in simulations of systems of different sizes while the parameter (cid:109) (cid:68) is tuned and a speciﬁc value (cid:109) (cid:68) * ( T ; L ) is determined for each system size from the ‘‘coexistence’’ condition—two equal - energy minima in F L ( x c ) . The ﬁgure shows a monotonic increase with system size L in the ‘‘interfacial energy , ’’ (cid:68) F L ( x c ) , deﬁned as the height FIG . 3 . Phase diagram for the lipid - cholesterol model . (cid:126) a (cid:33) The phase diagram as a function of cholesterol concentration x C and reduced temperature T / T M . The insets to the ﬁgure show different snapshots of microconﬁgurations corresponding to the different phases in the diagram . The snapshots are not given to scale . The different phases labeled in the phase diagram are so , solid - ordered (cid:126) gel (cid:33) ; ld , liquid - disordered (cid:126) ﬂuid (cid:33) ; and lo , liquid - ordered , where the ﬁrst letter refers to the lateral order of the phase and the second letter refers to the conformational order of the phase . (cid:126) b (cid:33) The phase diagram as a function of the chemical potential difference (cid:109) (cid:68) and T / T M . P C and P t are the critical point terminating the ld - lo coex - istence region and the triple point , respectively , as described in the text . 5796 PRE 59 NIELSEN , MIAO , IPSEN , ZUCKERMANN , AND MOURITSEN of the maximum relative to the minima of the spectral free - energy function . This ﬁnite - size behavior indicates the exis - tence of a ﬁrst - order transition (cid:64) 20 (cid:35) . The magnitude of the energy barriers between the coexisting phases can be esti - mated . For example , for a system of size L (cid:53) 20 , (cid:68) F L ( x c ) ld - lo (cid:46) 3 k B T and (cid:68) F L ( x c ) so - lo (cid:46) 4 . 5 k B T . The ﬁnite - size analysis also yields evidence for the pres - ence of a critical point terminating the ld - lo coexistence . In Fig . 5 we show the ﬁnite - size analysis of the simulation data for three different temperatures close to the critical endpoint of the ld - lo coexistence region . The inserts in the ﬁgure show the variation of the spectral free energy as a function of system size for the three different temperatures . For the low - est temperature , T (cid:53) 1 . 007 T M (cid:64) Fig . 5 (cid:126) a (cid:33)(cid:35) , the ﬁnite - size analysis shows a linear increase of the energy associated with an interface between the ld and the lo phases , indicating the existence of a ﬁrst - order phase transition . The slope of the linear relation corresponds to the interfacial tension be - tween the two phases . For the highest temperature , T (cid:53) 1 . 018 T M (cid:64) Fig . 5 (cid:126) c (cid:33)(cid:35) , (cid:68) F L ( x c ) ld - lo decreases as a function of system size L , demonstrating the absence of a phase tran - sition for this temperature . Finally , the results for T (cid:53) 1 . 013 T M (cid:64) Fig . 5 (cid:126) b (cid:33)(cid:35) suggest that the ‘‘interfacial energy’’ at this temperature for large system sizes approaches a con - stant value , indicating that the critical point of the ld - lo co - existence region is located close to T (cid:53) 1 . 013 T M . A precise determination of the line of the three - phase co - existence , or the position of the triple point , requires system - atic simulations for different system sizes , which turns out to be practically impossible . We have , therefore , contented our - selves with making a good estimate from a single histogram calculated for a sufﬁciently large system . Figure 6 shows the histogram P ( (cid:171) , x c ) for a system of size L (cid:53) 18 at a tempera - ture 0 . 997 T M . The histogram demonstrates the coexistence of the three distinct phases : the so phase , with a low internal energy and low cholesterol concentration , the ld phase , with a high internal energy and a very modest cholesterol concen - tration , and the lo phase , with an intermediate internal energy and a relatively high cholesterol concentration . Based on this result we have estimated the location of the three phase line FIG . 4 . Finite - size scaling plot of F L ( x C ) .

The region of coexistence between the so and the ld phases is very narrow and both the low - temperature bound (cid:126) the three phase coexistence line (cid:33) and the high - temperature bound (cid:126) the main transition point of the pure lipid system (cid:33) are strongly dependent on system size . It is , therefore , also very time consuming to obtain histograms of the distribution function at the coexistence , which have sufﬁcient accuracy for a ﬁnite - size scaling analysis . We have thus used the Fer - renberg Swendsen reweighting technique (cid:64) 18 (cid:35) to estimate the locations of the boundaries of the so - ld coexistence region . Speciﬁcally , we have through the reweighting procedure ex - trapolated to higher temperatures the probability distribution functions obtained from the three - phase histogram . The phase diagrams in Fig . 3 exhibit all the characteristics of macroscopic decoupling between the translational and the chain - conformational degrees of freedom : the appearance of the lo phase , and the two uncoupled transitions associated with this phase speciﬁcally , the so - lo and the ld - lo transi - tions . These two transitions correspond to the distinct order - ing processes of the translational and the chain - conformational degrees of freedom , respectively . It is clear that this phenomenon is a macroscopic consequence of the dual - natured interaction of the cholesterol molecule with the translational and chain - conformational degrees of freedom of the lipid molecules . Figure 3 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , along with our understand - ing of the so - ld transition in the pure lipid system , as de - scribed in Ref . (cid:64) 2 (cid:35) and summarized in Fig . 2 , provides clues as to how the molecular mechanism of cholesterol is macro - scopically manifested . In the one - component system of the lipid , the so - ld transition is predominantly driven by the con - formational entropy associated with the disordered state of the lipid chains , and the transition temperature T M is deter - mined by the competition between the conformational - entropy effect and the strength of the effective interactions between conformationally ordered chains . Incorporation of the cholesterol molecule into the lipid system creates a com - plex picture of macroscopic ordering phenomena . Below T M , the so phase can only solubilize very low concentrations of the cholesterol without losing its (cid:126) quasi - long - range (cid:33) trans - lational order , due to the ‘‘crystal - breaking’’ function of the cholesterol . Once the concentration reaches certain small , temperature - dependent values , the ‘‘crystal - breaking’’ func - tion of cholesterol indeed causes a breakdown of the global packing order of the chains , or the loss of the long - range translational order . This breakdown in turn affects the chain - ordering process , as it also implies a reduction in the strength of the effective cohesive interactions between chains in the conformationally ordered state . The reduced effective inter - action strength thus sets a maximal temperature for the mac - roscopic ordering of chain conformations ; and this maximal temperature is essentially the temperature of the three - phase line . Below this temperature , the cohesive interaction be - tween chains , albeit at its reduced strength , dominates over the conformational - entropy effect and sustains a macro - scopic conformational order , even though the translational order is lost . The ‘‘chain - ordering’’ tendency of the choles - terol , or the high afﬁnity of the cholesterol for conformation - ally ordered chains , results in relatively high solubility of the cholesterol in the lipid matrix , corresponding to the wide miscibility gap between the lipid - rich so and the cholesterol - rich lo phases . In contrast , above the temperature of the three - phase coexistence , and for intermediate cholesterol concentrations , the effect of conformational entropy takes precedence over both the cohesive interactions and the chain - ordering effect of cholesterol , favoring the ld phase as the equilibrium phase . Under this entropy dominance , the chain - ordering effect of cholesterol translates into its low afﬁnity for disordered lipid chains , as reﬂected in the moderate solu - bility of cholesterol molecules in the ld phase . At high enough cholesterol concentrations , however , the chain - ordering effect wins the competition over the entropy effect , reinstating the macroscopic order in the lipid chain confor - mations , i . e . , the lo phase . This ordering event , which only involves the conformational degrees of freedom , is mani - fested in the reasonably wide region of the ld - lo coexistence . B . Structural analysis : simulations within the canonical ensemble In this section we present results of a detailed structural analysis of the different phases described above . The results have all been obtained by performing simulations within the canonical ensemble as described in Sec . III . Each simulation is performed for a system size of N (cid:53) 1600 . The thermody - namic average of the structure factor contains 10 5 different microconﬁgurations with a time interval of 100 MCS’s be - tween two consecutive conﬁgurations . Figures 7 – 11 summarize calculated structure factors char - acterizing the lateral structures of the various thermodynamic phases . Figures 7 (cid:126) a (cid:33) and 7 (cid:126) b (cid:33) show , for the so and the ld phase , respectively , the structure factors S T ( q (cid:87) ) and S O ( q (cid:87) ) as well as the circular averages of S T , S O , S C , and S O - C . In Fig . 7 (cid:126) a (cid:33) the plots of S T ( q (cid:87) ) and S O ( q (cid:87) ) give a clear signal of a solid hexagonal phase characterized by a lattice spacing close to d . In Fig . 7 (cid:126) b (cid:33) the plot of S T ( q (cid:87) ) demonstrates the liquid characteristics of the ld phase . The average interpar - ticle distance can be determined from the position of the ﬁrst diffuse scattering ring , and a rough estimate gives a value of (cid:94) r (cid:38) (cid:39) 1 . 115 d . Figure 8 displays both the total structure factor S T and the two partial structure factors S O and S C , calculated at T (cid:53) 0 . 969 T M and x C (cid:53) 0 . 165 where the system is in the lo phase . The characteristics of the phase , as far as its lateral structure is concerned , is unambiguously that of a liquid . More systematic analysis of the lo phase is summarized in Fig . 9 . The three upper ﬁgures show the circular averages of S T , S O , S C and S O - C calculated at three different locations in the parameter region where the lo phase exists . The three lower ﬁgures are the corresponding snapshots of microcon - ﬁgurations . The collective ordering in conformations of the lipid chains is apparent . The ﬁgure at the right further dem - onstrates the ‘‘rigidifying’’ effect of the cholesterol : The high degree of chain ordering as illustrated in the snapshot is stabilized only by the incorporated cholesterol , as the pure lipid system is in the ld phase at this temperature . Clearly , the appearance of the lo phase as a stable equilibrium phase is a macroscopic manifestation of the dual molecular func - tion of the cholesterol . When present at relatively high con - centrations , the cholesterol destroys the quasi - long - range 5798 PRE 59 NIELSEN , MIAO , IPSEN , ZUCKERMANN , AND MOURITSEN translational order and at the same time induces or reinforces macroscopic order in lipid chain conformations . Figure 9 offers more information on the details of the lateral structure of the lo phase . The three graphs of S C ( q (cid:87) ) all bear a diffuse ring located close to (cid:117) q (cid:117) (cid:53) 0 . 4 ( 2 (cid:112) / d ) . The intensity of the ring increases with the concentration of the cholesterol . An examination of the corresponding snapshots gives clue to the structures that give rise to these rings . It appears that most of the cholesterol molecules and a signiﬁ - cant fraction of the lipid chains aggregate with their own kind to form one - dimensional threadlike microstructures . The physical reason for this particular structure , roughly speaking , lies in the difference between the interaction po - tential between two cholesterol molecules (cid:64) Fig . 1 (cid:126) d (cid:33)(cid:35) and that between a cholesterol molecule and an ordered lipid chain (cid:64) Fig . 1 (cid:126) b (cid:33)(cid:35) . The relatively weaker cholesterol - cholesterol interaction gives the cholesterol a tendency to minimize nearest - neighbor contacts between its own kind in exchange for maximal number of contacts with ordered lipid chains . The formation of the threadlike microstructures al - lows that tendency to be expressed to an appreciable extent at high concentrations of the cholesterol . The data for S O - C indicates that the average distance between an ordered lipid chain and a cholesterol molecule is about 1 . 3 d . In a thread - like structure where two cholesterol molecules are separated by one lipid chain , the distance between the cholesterol mol - FIG . 7 .

The diffuse rings in (cid:126) b (cid:33) show the existence of the liquid phase .

Such a conﬁguration should give rise to a diffuse ring located at (cid:117) q (cid:117) (cid:39) 0 . 4 ( 2 (cid:112) / d ) . And this signal should be more appreciable in S C ( q (cid:87) ) than in S O ( q (cid:87) ) naturally , due to the relatively higher fraction of those cho - lesterol molecules forming the threadlike structure out of the total number of the cholesterol molecules . This picture is consistent with the simulation results . Finally Figs . 10 and 11 show the structure factors calcu - lated within the so - lo and ld - lo coexistence region , respec - tively . The structure factor S T ( q (cid:87) ) in Fig . 10 gives a clear signal of both a liquid and a solid phase . S C ( q (cid:87) ) , the partial structure factor related to the cholesterol , on the other hand , displays only the diffuse properties of a liquid , indicating that the cholesterol dissolves in the liquid (cid:126) lo (cid:33) domain . The structure factors in Fig . 11 , corresponding to the ld - lo coex - istence , show no sign of structural differences between the two coexisting phases . This result further supports the char - acterization of the lo phase as a liquid phase . V . DISCUSSION Experimentally observed equilibrium phase behavior of bilayer systems of binary mixtures of phospholipids and cho - lesterol is characterized by a macroscopic decoupling of the translational degrees of freedom from the internal molecular , FIG . 9 .

This phenomenon provides a meaningful context for investigating the generic physics involved in interplay , both at the micro - scopic level and at the macroscopic level , between transla - tional and internal molecular degrees of freedom . To this end , we have formulated a microscopic model to describe a two - dimensional system composed of two distinct types of ‘‘model molecules , ’’ representing lipid molecules and cho - lesterol molecules , respectively , and we have carried out a statistical mechanical study , based on Monte Carlo computer simulations , of the model to investigate the equilibrium phase behavior of the model system . The model differs in an essential way from some of the earlier lattice models developed to describe the phase behav - ior of lipid - cholesterol mixtures : It provides an off - lattice , and therefore realistic , representation of the translational de - grees of freedom in terms of a speciﬁc random - lattice algo - rithm . Naturally , this feature enables us to characterize (cid:126) and make predictions on (cid:33) the macroscopic behavior of the trans - lational degrees of freedom , i . e . , the lateral structures of dif - ferent thermodynamic phases of the model system in a faith - ful way . Given both our aim of elucidating generic behavior of the interplay and the considerable computational effort required by the explicit treatment of translational degrees of freedom , the rest of the ingredients of the model correspond to mini - mal descriptions of the relevant microscopic physics . The chain conformational degrees of freedom and the associated phase space are simpliﬁed into two molecular conforma - tional states . Cholesterol is treated as a simple substitutional impurity . Its molecular function in a lipid bilayer is de - scribed , based on an earlier hypothesis (cid:64) 5 , 21 (cid:35) , to be dual , both as a ‘‘crystal breaker’’ and as a ‘‘chain rigidiﬁer . ’’ This molecular mechanism forms a microscopic basis for the in - terplay between translational and conformational degrees of freedom . The microscopic interactions , those between a cho - lesterol molecule and a lipid chain , in particular , are all de - signed to only contain features that are essential and neces - sary for describing both the simple phase behavior of one - component systems of lipid and the dual molecular function of cholesterol . Our rather extensive and systematic study of the minimal model based on Monte Carlo computer simulations has led to a phase diagram for the model system . This phase diagram displays the same topology as the experimentally obtained phase diagram (cid:64) 10 (cid:35) . Particularly , the theoretical phase dia - gram demonstrates that the proposed microscopic model does provide a picture of microscopic physics underlying the ability of cholesterol to uncouple , already at very low con - centrations , the macroscopic ordering processes of the trans - lational and chain conformational degrees of freedom . The fact that the model is only a minimal one suggests that the macroscopic decoupling between translational and chain conformational degrees of freedom in these systems may not depend sensitively on details of the microscopic physics and may , therefore , be a generic phenomenon . It has actually been argued that the phase behavior of the DPPC - cholesterol bilayer system contains some generic features for mixtures of lipids and cholesterol or cholesterol - like molecules (cid:64) 5 , 22 , 23 (cid:35) , although more concrete experimental evidence is yet to be obtained . In addition , our paper provides detailed information on the lateral structure of the different phases . The structure of the cholesterol - rich phase is of particular interest , since it has been the subject of a long and continuing debate in the ex - perimental literature (cid:64) 24 (cid:35) . The structure factor that we have obtained from the simulations clearly shows that the lo phase is indeed a liquid phase . More interestingly , the partial struc - ture factors associated with cholesterol molecules and or - dered lipid chains , respectively , show signatures of an addi - tional structure that is characterized by length scales roughly twice that of the average distance between nearest neighbors . Inspection of the related microscopic conﬁgurations leads to an interesting observation : cholesterol molecules and those lipid chains that are in direct contact with cholesterol mol - ecules tend to form ‘‘threadlike’’ structures . In other words , in these structures , each molecule tends to align (cid:126) linearly (cid:33) with its own kind . This tendency becomes more pronounced at higher cholesterol concentrations (cid:126) data not shown in the paper (cid:33) . The ‘‘threads’’ are short , involving only a few mol - ecules , and there is no sign of long - range correlations in their orientations . The origin of this behavior may be understood as follows . At low and intermediate temperatures (cid:126) compared with the temperature of main transition in the one - component system of lipid (cid:33) , the system in the lo phase con - sists of cholesterol and chains in the ordered state only . Therefore , the model effectively becomes an off - lattice anti - ferromagnetic Ising model with a spin - exchange interaction of strength 14 V o - o ( R ij ) (cid:49) 14 V c - c ( R ij ) (cid:50) 12 V o - c ( R ij ) and an ex - ternal ﬁeld (cid:64) 25 (cid:35) . This model has not been studied . But , a related model , an antiferromagnetic Ising model deﬁned on a lattice with elastic deformability , has been shown to display a low - temperature stripe phase , where like - signed spins line up to form stripes (cid:64) 26 (cid:35) . The characteristic periodicity in the stripe phase is twice that of the average lattice spacing (cid:64) 26 (cid:35) . The presence of the ‘‘threadlike’’ structures revealed by FIG . 11 .

PRE 59 5801 OFF - LATTICE MODEL FOR THE PHASE BEHAVIOR OF . . . our simulations has some experimental support , particularly from early ﬂuorescence (cid:64) 27 (cid:35) and x - ray diffraction (cid:64) 28 (cid:35) stud - ies . The results of these studies were interpreted as support for a structural model where lipid and cholesterol molecules formed stoichiometrical complexes and moreover , the com - plexes aligned themselves linearly (cid:126) see (cid:64) 29 (cid:35) for an early re - view of those studies (cid:33) . Our study shows , however , that the partial alignment of molecules as observed in the simulations requires no chemically speciﬁc mechanisms such as the for - mation of stoichiometrical complexes . It is important to note that the ‘‘threadlike’’ structures in the lo phase are not the ripple structures observed in experimental systems in so - lo coexistence region (cid:64) 30 (cid:35) . The ripple structures involve much larger length scales as well as nonplanar membrane surface conﬁgurations (cid:64) 31 , 32 (cid:35) . We end our presentation with a ﬁnal remark on further applications of the proposed minimal model . Indeed , the to - pology of the presented phase diagram holds only for a range of values of the microscopic parameters . It is expected that the model , given its various microscopic parameters , is ca - pable of describing more types of equilibrium phase behav - ior than that discussed in this paper . In other words , by sys - tematically varying the values of certain parameters and carrying out similar studies of the model , one can establish a much larger picture of generic equilibrium phase behavior of two - component systems . Varying values of the microscopic parameters may represent variations in , for example , sterol type . In fact , cholesterol is the end product of a biosynthetic pathway , along which there are other sterols acting as evo - lutionary precursors to cholesterol . Further studies of the model are in progress , aiming at capturing the systematics of equilibrium phase behavior of a range of two - component systems modeling mixtures of lipids with those sterols along the biosynthetic pathway .

(cid:64) 25 (cid:35) In the case where the lo phase consists of only cholesterol and gel chains in the ordered state , the microscopic Hamiltonian Eq . (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) can be rewritten as an Ising model in an external ﬁeld . If we associate the Ising spin S (cid:53)(cid:49) 1 state with a chain in the ordered state and the Ising spin S (cid:53)(cid:50) 1 state with a cholesterol molecule , the occupation variables L io and L ic can be ex - pressed as L io (cid:53) ( 1 (cid:49) S i ) / 2 , L ic (cid:53) ( 1 (cid:50) S i ) / 2 .

Noting that the interac - tion potentials V o - o and V o - c have very similar strength and that the strength of the interaction potential V c - c is relatively small , we see that the model becomes an antiferromagnetic Ising model in an external temperature and pressure dependent ﬁeld .
