The genetic exchange mechanism is dependent on the synaptonemal complex ( SC ) , a protein structure localized between the homologous chromosomes . Current structural models of the SC are based on electron microscopy , super resolution , and expansion microscopy studies using chemical fixatives and sample dehydration of gonads , which are methodologies known to produce structural artifacts . We have developed a novel electron microscopy sample - preparation approach where pachytene cells are isolated from mouse testis by FACS , followed by cryo - fixation and cryo - substitution to achieve visualization of a close - to - native structure of the SC . We found that the central region of the SC was wider than previously recognized , and the transverse filaments more densely packed in the central region . Furthermore , we identified a structure nucleating the central element of the SC . Introduction The Synaptonemal Complex ( SC ) is a conserved macromolecular proteinaceus scaffold that keeps homologous chromosomes ( homologs ) together until they have exchanged DNA during meiosis 1 . The SC is observed as a tripartite structure composed of two well - delimited lateral elements ( LEs ) and a central region ( CR ) . Protruding out from the LEs , fine transverse filaments ( TFs ) cross the CR and , together with other SC - specific proteins , form the central element ( CE ) at a central position of the CR . Structural studies , as well as biochemical and molecular characterization of SC proteins 3 in mice , Drosophila , C . elegans and budding yeast have led to several models for the structure and organization of the SC 2 , 3 , 12 – 21 , 4 , 22 – 31 , 5 , 32 – 34 , 6 – 11 . Exchange of genetic material ( meiotic recombination ) depends on intact CR and CE structures as structural protein mutations result in recombination blockage , meiotic arrest and massive cell death of meiocytes 7 , 26 , 29 , 35 – 38 . There is still a dearth of detailed knowledge of the interplay between CR structure and meiotic recombination . Understanding the close - to - native structure of the CR may shed light on the recombination process and the role of the SC in this process . Structural studies aiming to delineate the fine structure of the SC and the relative localization of its components have been performed by electron microscopy ( EM ) , superresolution and expansion microscopy 2 , 3 , 33 , 39 , 40 , 8 , 9 , 12 , 16 , 18 , 22 , 30 , 31 . A common caveat with these structural studies has been the use of chemical fixatives and sample dehydration or sample spreading of the gonads prior to EM analysis or superresolution / expansion microscopy . These methods are known to produce artifacts in the fine structure of macromolecular complexes 41 – 44 . However , no attempts have been made to establish a cryo - fixation / substitution experimental setup followed by electron tomography in order to achieve close - to - native structure of the SC . Therefore , we developed a novel approach to study the close - to - native structure of the SC in mouse germ cells . In this procedure , we isolated and enriched cells in which the SC is fully formed ( pachytene cells ) by Fluorescence - activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) . We then implemented a High - Pressure Freezing and Freeze - 4 Substitution protocol ( HPF / FS ) to enable cryo - fixation and cryo - substitution of these pachytene cells . Finally , we performed electron tomography ( ET ) of the SC in the cryo - preserved pachytene cells . We compared the structure of SCs in cryo - fixated pachytene cells versus SCs from the classical chemical fixation of seminiferous tubules from mice . We observed that the structure and organization of the SC components from cryo - fixated cells is different from its classical tripartite structure as reported so far . We found that the CR is wider and that the TFs seem to be more densely packed in the CR . Furthermore , we observed a central repetitive structure that nucleates the CE . Thus , our data provides ( for the first time ever ) a snapshot of the close - to - native structure of the SC . Results An experimental approach to elucidate the close - to - native structure of the synaptonemal complex We established a workflow to describe the close - to - native structure of the SC in pachytene cells in mouse testis . FACS sorting of testicular cells and isolation of pachytene cells prior to HPF / FS ( hence , FACS / HPS / FS ) was used to remove constraints caused by limited freezing depth in tissues treated using the HPF technique . We compared the integrity of cellular structures in pachytene cells prepared using FACS / HPS / FS versus the classical chemical fixation methods applied to seminiferous tubules . It has been shown that a close - to - native structure of the Golgi apparatus and the nuclear pore complex can be visualized following HPF / FS preparation of cells 45 – 49 . We performed ultrathin sectioning of the pachytene cells and analyzed the integrity of the 5 Golgi apparatus and the nuclear pore complex by EM in these cells . As was the case of studies of other cell types , we found the Golgi apparatus and nuclear pore complex to be better preserved in cryo - preserved pachytene cells than in chemically fixed seminiferous tubules ( Fig . 1a - f ) . The SC components in cryo - preserved pachytene cells are not as well - defined as in chemically fixed seminiferous tubules The structure of the SC was first analyzed in chemically fixed seminiferous tubules and FACS - sorted pachytene cells . In a frontal view of the SC , we were able to clearly identify the borders of the LEs and the CE ( Fig . 2a , c ) . These borders were more diffuse in SCs in cryo - preserved cells ( Fig . 2b ) . The transverse filaments were also more distinct in pachytene cells in chemically fixed samples ( Fig . 2a - c ) . Thus , it is likely that the sharply defined border for the different SC structures result from fixation artifacts following the use of chemicals . We next performed double - tilt electron tomography of SCs in chemically fixed seminiferous tubules and in cryo - preserved pachytene cells . We manually segmented the SCs that were clearly defined in 4 and 5 tomograms from chemically fixed seminiferous tubules and cryo - preserved pachytene cells , respectively ( Supplementary Videos 1 - 4 for chemically fixed samples and Supplementary Videos 5 - 9 for cryo - preserved samples ) . The outer and inner borders of the LEs and the borders of the CE in SCs from chemically fixed seminiferous tubules could be traced , whereas only the inner border of the LEs in SCs from cryo - preserved cells could be traced ( Fig . 3a - d and 6 Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Finally , we delineated TFs that fully cross the space between the inner side of the LE and the CE with a single line following their path ( Fig . 3a - d and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Thus , we found that the different sub - structures of the SC are less sharply outlined in cryo - preserved pachytene cells , representing a close - to native structure of the SC different than that resulting from the chemical fixation of meiotic cells . The CR of the SC in cryo - preserved pachytene cells shows an extended width We found the CR to be the only SC component to be clearly defined in cryo - preserved pachytene cells . We measured and compared CR width in different slices of the tomograms of frontally orientated SCs following the application of the two different fixative methods . The top , the middle and the bottom sections of the tomogram of SCs were selected for analysis ( i . e . in the Z plane of the SC ) . Measurements of the width were taken every 100 nm along the Y axis of the SC ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The width of the CR in cryo - preserved samples was estimated to be 120 nm on average , whereas the width of the CR of the SC in chemically fixed seminiferous tubules was estimated to be 103 nm on average ( Fig . 3e ) . Thus , the width of the CR in SCs of cryo - preserved pachytene cells was approximately 16 % wider . The organization of transverse filaments Next , we analyzed the organization of the TFs of the SC in cryo - preserved pachytene cells and chemically fixed seminiferous tubules . A neighbor density analysis ( nda ) was used , which is a method used to analyze the spatial 7 relationships between modeled objects in tomograms 50 – 52 . As proof of principle , to corroborate that the nda approach was suitable for our purposes , we challenged it by computing the preferred closest distance between LEs in cryo - preserved pachytene cells ( Fig . 3f ) . We rationalized that the preferred closest distance between the LEs of the SC , defined by the contact points between the TFs and the inner border region of the LEs ( Fig . 3f ) , should be similar to the average distance between the LEs obtained by direct measuring in the 3D structures . Indeed , the preferred closest distance between the LEs was positioned in the 120 to 130 nm range ( Fig . 3f ) , similar to the 120 nm identified as the average distance between LEs ( Fig . 3e ) . Next , the preferred closest distance between TFs in the 4 and 5 different 3D volumes of SCs from chemically fixed and cryo - preserved samples was analyzed . We found the preferred closest distance for TFs varied for SCs independently of the fixation protocol used ( Fig . 4a - b ) . However , while the closest distances in tomograms for chemically fixed seminiferous tubules varied from 0 - 18 nm ( Fig . 4a ) , the variation in cryo - fixed pachytene was only 0 - 8 nm ( Fig . 4b ) , suggesting a higher density of TFs in SCs when analyzed by HPF / FS . Thus , cryo - preservation provides more information about TFs organization in the CR of the SC . Furthermore , the observation that there is not a constant preferred closest distance for the TFs in tomograms suggests that the disposition of the TFs in the CR is dynamic , as suggested by live cell imaging analysis of the SC in C . elegans 20 . Next , we performed sub - tomogram averaging 53 , 54 of TFs from 4 tomograms from chemically fixed seminiferous tubules ( 55 and 62 single TFs placed to 8 the left and right of the CE respectively , Supplementary Fig . 3a - c ) and from 5 tomograms from cryo - preserved pachytene cells ( 103 and 94 single TFs placed to the left and right of the CE respectively , Supplementary Fig . 3d - f ) . We found no conserved organization for the averaged TFs using either fixation protocol ( Fig 5 . and Supplementary Videos 10 - 11 ) , thus implying that individual TFs do not attain a stable conformation in the CR . Thus , our results support the view that the organization and TF structure in the CR of the SC is highly dynamic and / or flexible . Analysis of the CE of the SC identified a central 10 nm structure We observed a repeated structure across the CE of the CR of the SC in all tomograms from cryo - preserved pachytene cells , not apparent in chemically fixed seminiferous tubules ( Fig . 6a - b ) . To further analyze this structure , we averaged 35 CE structures in cryo - preserved pachytene cells and identified an averaged structure that resembled the individual structures ( Fig . 6c and Supplementary Video 12 ) . The average structure does not reveal fine structural details ; however , in every plane of the 3D structure , a round shape approximately 10 nm in width in the inner part of the CE is noticeable ( Fig . 6d - g ) . Discussion Cryo - fixation of the SC reveals a structural organization that differs in several ways from the SC structure resulting from the use of chemical fixation methods ( Fig . 7 ) . We show that the outer borders of the LEs and the CE are not well - defined , suggesting that the sharp definition of the borders in 9 chemically fixed SCs are preparation artefacts . We found the distance between the inner part of the LEs and the CR to be wider than reported . The TFs seem to be more densely packed than previously recognized and an organized structure runs throughout its entire length of the CE ( Fig 7 ) . Structural analysis of the SC by Immuno - EM , EM - tomography and expansion microscopy data 2 , 8 , 9 , 22 using chemical fixatives is likely to introduce artifacts . These fixatives display a slow penetration speed relative to many cellular processes and may react chemically with cellular structures 42 – 44 , 55 , 56 . Thus , chemical fixatives used for conventional EM may result in the aggregation of proteins in a complex , such as the SC that is composed of multiple sub - structures merged together for an extended time period ( the leptotene to pachytene stages of meiosis ) . Therefore , observation of a bi - or multilayered TFs organization may be a result of CR protein stacking due to an extended chemical fixation process . Additionally , preparation of SC spreads may also produce artifacts as the cells are subjected to swelling for several minutes prior to chemical fixation and spreading . In contrast , cryo - fixation of isolated pachytene cells takes place in 10 - 12 milliseconds , providing a snapshot of biological structures inside the cell 44 , 57 . A wider CR It has been reported that the width of the CR of the SC is approximately 100 nm using chemical fixation methods of meiotic cells 25 , 31 , 39 , 58 . However , it has been suggested that the coiled - coiled region of the murine SYCP1 protein forming the TFs that span the distance between the LE and the CE is 90 nm 10 long 13 generating a theoretical CR width of 180 nm . The increased width of the CR found in cryo - fixed cells accommodates more of the proposed relative TF length . TF Organization After sub - tomogram averaging , we did not observe any stable conformation of the average TFs . This is the expected scenario when averaging dynamic and / or flexible structures so that every targeted complex represents a unique conformational species 59 . Thus , dynamic TFs organization in the CR observed in this work is more comparable to the high mobility of SC components in live cell imaging studies . Theses TFs dynamics , in turn , may be dictated by the liquid - like crystal properties of the SC components 20 . However , we cannot completely rule out that sample staining in this close - to - native approach and / or low number of particles are making it difficult to visualize stable TF conformation in the CR , thereby precluding functional and physiological interpretations 59 . Thus , the development of methodologies allowing the visualization of the native TF conformation is required . CE organization Contrary to the TFs , when we averaged the observed structures in the CE , we visualized a central structure with a doughnut shape of more or less 10 nm in diameter . This implies that CE proteins may be forming more stable structures that help to keep the LE of the SC together . CE stability may explain why some of these proteins can form filaments in vitro , resembling the CE , 11 whereas the TF protein SYCP1 can only polymerize in vivo when overexpressed in the cytoplasm of cultured cells 8 , 60 , 61 . Further methodological development that makes it possible to analyze the native SC structure should allow us to understand CR , TF , and CE structures as well as the LEs of the SC . Docking of atomic resolution crystallography maps of SYCP1 and CE proteins in the native structure of the SC should provide us with a high - resolution view of the SC . In addition , systematic 3D reconstructions of full - length SCs at different stages of maturation during meiosis will help us to understand how this structural scaffold promotes meiotic recombination . Methods Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) of Pachytene cells Experimental procedures involving mice were approved by the Stockholm - North Animal Ethical Committee . Spermatogenic cell dissociation from testis , staining , gating and sorting of pachytene cells were done as reported above 62 . High - Pressure Freezing ( HPF ) Sorted pachytene cells were pelleted at 3500 rpm at 4°C for 10 min and re - suspend in 600 μ l of a 1 : 1 solution of modified HBSS ( Hanks’ balanced salt solution , supplemented with 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 2 , 6 . 6 mM sodium pyruvate and 0 . 05 % sodium lactate ) and FBS ( fetal bovine serum ) . Cells were pelleted once again and resuspended with 50 μ l of 2 % low - temperature gelling agarose at 37°C 63 diluted in modified HBSS plus FBS ( as mentioned above ) . 12 From this step on , solutions and plastic tips were kept in a heating block at 37°C . After centrifugation , 30 μ l of the supernatant of agarose solution were removed and the pelleted cells were carefully mixed with the remaining agarose solution . The pachyte / agarose solution was briefly kept at 37ºC until cryo - fixation . Ten μ l of these pachytene cells in agarose were placed on a flat carrier ( 1 . 2 mm of diameter and 200 µm of depth ) and high - pressure frozen in the EMPACT2 high - pressure freezer ( in accordince with the manufacturer’s instructions , Leica Microsystems ) . Freeze - substitution ( FS ) Frozen samples were freeze - substituted in the automatic Leica Microsystems EM AFS2 . A freeze - substitution protocol that allows improved contrast of proteins and membranes was adapted for this work 46 , 47 , 64 , 65 and carried out over a 7 - day period as follows : Frozen samples on the flat carriers were placed in a solution of acetone containing 0 . 5 % tannic acid and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde at - 90ºC for 48 hours . The temperature was gradually increased to - 25ºC in an 8 - hour cycle and the samples were then rinsed three times with acetone and submerged in a solution of acetone with 2 % osmium tetra - oxide plus 0 . 8 % potassium ferrocyanide and 0 . 5 % uranyl acetate for 4 hours . The temperature was then gradually increased to + 4ºC in a 2 - hour cycle and the samples were rinsed three times with acetone . Samples were transferred to room temperature ( RT ) and infiltrated with a 1 : 1 mixture of propylene oxide / acetone for 5 min and 3 changes of propylene oxide for 30 min each . For embedding , the samples were submerged in a mixture of 1 : 1 propylene oxide / Durcupan overnight prior 13 to incubation in freshly made Durcupan for 3 hours and finally , they were embedded and polymerized in Durcupan at 60ºC for 72 hours . Chemical fixation of seminiferous tubules and sorted pachytene cells Seminiferous tubules were processed as described above 8 . Briefly , small fragments of mice testes were fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and 4 % paraformaldehyde for 2 h at RT , post - fixed with 2 % osmium tetroxide for 1 h , rinsed with cacodylate buffer , dehydrated through graded ethanol solutions , embedded in Durcupan and polymerized at 60ºC for 72 hours . Sorted pachytene cells were processed as mentioned above until they were pelleted and resuspended with 50 μ l of 2 % low - temperature gelling agarose at 37°C . Then chemical fixation with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and 4 % paraformaldehyde was performed and further processing was done as for the seminiferous tubules . EM data acquisition , tomogram generation and analysis For conventional TEM , 80 nm ultrathin sections were made using an ultra - microtome ( Leica ) . Sections were placed on formvar / carbon - coated one - slot cupper grids ( Agar Scientific ) , stained for 20 min in uranyl acetate and 10 min in lead citrate . Grids were observed with an electron microscope CM120 ( FEI microscope ) at 100 kV equipped with a side - entry MegaView III CCD camera to record the images and AnalySYS - 3 . 2 software ( Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions , Münster , Germany ) . 14 For electron tomography , 100nm - thick sections were placed on formvar / carbon - coated one - slot gold grids ( Agar Scientific ) , previously incubated with 10 nm colloidal gold for alignment during tomogram reconstruction . The thickness of the sections was chosen accordingly to the thickness of the SC in the Z plane 22 . Grids were then post - stained with 3 % uranyl acetate for 10 min . Initial screening to identify the SCs was performed with an electron microscope CM120 ( FEI microscope ) at 100 kV . For tomographic data collection , we used an FEG CM200 FEI microscope operating at 200 kV . The microscope was equipped with a cooled slow scan 2048 x 2048 TemCam F214 CCD camera and EM - MENU software for automated data collection ( TVIPS , Gauting , Germany ) . The sections were pre - irradiated for 20 min before data collection at the beam intensity corresponding to the actual data acquisition . 260 images ( double - tilt from - 65° to + 65° with one - degree increments ) were collected and used for alignment and back projection reconstruction with IMOD software 66 , 67 . Signal - to - noise ratio in the tomograms was improved by SIRT iterative reconstruction in IMOD . Pixel sizes for the tomograms were 0 . 7838 nm at 23 , 000 magnification and 0 . 3248 nm at 50 , 000 magnification , for chemically - and cryo - fixed samples , respectively . Manual segmentation was done with IMOD drawing tools and the neighbor density analysis was taken and modified from previous reports 51 , 52 . TF and CE structure averaging was done according to the PEET ( Particle Estimation for Electron Tomography ) analysis tutorials 53 , 54 .
