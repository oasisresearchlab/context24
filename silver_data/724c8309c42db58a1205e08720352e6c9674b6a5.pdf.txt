Singer 1 , 2 , 3 † Cellular messenger RNA levels are achieved by the combinatorial complexity of factors controlling transcription , yet the small number of molecules involved in these pathways fluctuates stochastically . It has not yet been experimentally possible to observe the activity of single polymerases on an endogenous gene to elucidate how these events occur in vivo . Here , we describe a method of fluctuation analysis of fluorescently labeled RNA to measure dynamics of nascent RNA — including initiation , elongation , and termination — at an active yeast locus . We find no transcriptional memory between initiation events , and elongation speed can vary by threefold throughout the cell cycle . By measuring the abundance and intranuclear mobility of an upstream transcription factor , we observe that the gene firing rate is directly determined by trans - activating factor search times . T ranscription initiation occurs through a series of sequential steps initiated by the binding of gene - specific activators and coactivators and resulting in recruitment of the basal transcription machinery and RNA poly - merase ( 1 ) . Genome - wide chromatin immuno - precipitation ( ChIP ) experiments have provided detailed information about the occupancy of transcription factors on DNA , and live - cell pho - tobleaching recovery studies on tandem gene repeats indicate that turnover of these factors is generally on the order of seconds ( 2 – 4 ) . These approaches describe the upstream regulators of transcription in a cellular context . However , to gain a functional understanding of transcription networks , it is necessary to observe the output of transcription , namely RNA production . We have developed a single - molecule assay to observe the enzymatic activity of an RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) molecule directly on an active gene in a living cell . This methodology enables direct measurement of promoter clearance , elongation , and termination rates . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we find that elongation is deterministic and initiation is stochastic . Moreover , by comparing nascent RNA dynamics with the reaction - diffusion behavior of an upstream transcription factor , we determinethatpromoterfiringrateisdictateddirect - ly by the search times in the nucleus required for the factor to find the gene . To detect RNAPII activity in living cells , we used a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – labeling approach adapted from the MS2 technique ( 5 , 6 ) . A cassette coding for 24 binding sites for the PP7 bacteriophage coat protein was inserted into the 5 ′ untranslated region ( 5 ′ UTR ) of a target gene ( 7 ) .

Thus , one can direct - ly measure both the earliest steps in pre - mRNA synthesis and the total dwell time of RNA at the site of transcription . The cell cycle – regulated POL1 promoter ( POL1 pro ) and PP7 binding site cassette ( 24 PBS ) were knocked in upstream of the endogenous GLT1 gene , which was then found to transcribe similarly to the endogenous POL1 gene ( fig . S1 ) . When monitored by using wide - field microscopy , nascent transcription sites ( TSs ) are detected as diffraction - limited fluores - cent puncta in the nucleus , the boundary of which is determined by using a red nuclear pore marker ( Fig . 1B ) . The POL1 promoter was active during late G 1 / S phase , but activity periods varied from cell to cell and even for different alleles within the same nucleus , as shown in a time series in two different cells ( Fig . 1B and movie S1 ) . Toanalyzetranscription kinetics , we followed the TS in the nucleus over time . The position and integrated intensity of an individual TS was de - termined by using a tracking algorithm ( 11 ) to generate the spatial trajectory and intensity time trace of the site ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . Three distinct phases in the time trace are evident : ( i ) the in - crease in fluorescence signal corresponding to polymerization through the PP7 cassette as PP7 - GFP binds recently transcribed RNA stem loops , ( ii ) a stable intensity of fluorescence correspond - ing to transcription of the GLT1 gene , and ( iii ) a sharp drop in fluorescence that corresponds to termination and release of the nascent RNA , which then rapidly diffuses away from the site ( movies S2 and S3 ) . For an actively transcribing gene , many such events will be superimposed , with RNAPIIs in various positions along the gene , necessitating an analysis approach that takes into account these nonequilibrium kinetic processes ( Fig . 2 , A and B , and movie S4 ) . To extract kinetic parameters from these transcription time traces , we devel - oped an analysis approach that takes advantage of the fluctuations inherent in the measurement ( 12 , 13 ) . An idealized fluorescence time trace for transcription of a single pre - mRNA is shown in Fig . 2C . This process can be described by an autocorrelation function G ( t ) , which is a discrete autocorrelation over all the transition probabil - ities for RNAPII ( 6 ) . The variables are the total dwell time of a transcript ( T ) , which includes elongation and termination , and the transcript initiation rate ( c ) . For long genes , the solution takes the form G ð t Þ ¼ ð T − t Þ cT 2 H ð T − t Þ ð 1 Þ where t is the autocorrelation delay and H de - notes the Heaviside step function , which is unity when t ≤ T and zero when t > T ( Fig . 2D ) . There - fore , by steady - state observations of TS fluctua - tions it is possible to measure both the transcript initiation rate and the total time a transcript spends at the TS . The autocorrelation for the POL1p - GLT1 construct reflects deterministic elongation times and no correlation between individual transcripts ( Fig . 2E ) . The autocorrelation shows a linear decay with a sharp transition at the time that corre - sponds to the dwell time of a transcript at the TS ( Τ = 290 T 30 s ) ( SEM ) . The processive nature of pre - mRNA synthesis , consisting of thousands of sequential enzymatic cycles , results in a central - limit process where the total dwell time is dis - tributed around a nonzero mean .

( C ) Diagram of a single transcript intensity trajectory . After pro - moter clearance , RNAPII proceeds through the 24 stem loops , resulting in a discrete fluorescence increase upon PP7 - GFP binding .

S2 ) . In addition , the autocorrelation vanishes at times greater than the dwell time , indicating that there is no tran - scriptional memory between initiation events . Thus , although the POL1 promoter is only active during a certain stage of the cell cycle , initiation events during this active period are stochastic and uncorrelated and occur with a frequency c = 1 . 3 T 0 . 72 min − 1 . We then sought to separate the kinetic pro - cesses of initiation , elongation , and termination . By placing the PP7 cassette in either the 5 ′ UTR or 3 ′ UTR of a long gene such as MDN1 ( 15 kb ) , one can measure dwell times in which termina - tion plays a lesser or greater role in comparison to elongation ( Fig . 3 , A to C ) ( 15 , 16 ) . With the cas - sette in the 5 ′ UTR , the dwell time is dominated by the downstream portion of the gene ( PP7 - MDN1 , Fig . 3D , red curve , and movies S5 andS6 ) , where the fluorescence is not changing , leading to the autocorrelation in Eq . 1 . With the cassette in the 3 ′ UTR ( MDN1 - PP7 , Fig . 3D , blue curve , and movie S7 ) , the autocorrelation reflects the transi - tions between N stem loops , which occur with frequency k : G ð t Þ ¼ k c 2 3 (cid:1) (cid:2) 1 ½ N ð N þ 1 Þ(cid:1) 2 e − k t ∑ N i ¼ 0 ð N − i Þ ½ (cid:2) ð N − i þ 1 Þð 2 N þ i þ 1 Þ ð k t Þ i i ! (cid:1) ð 2 Þ In this case , the total dwell time T equals N / k . By using this complementary approach to se - lectively emphasize early and late events in the lifetime of a nascent RNA , we can separate elon - gation from termination . MDN1 transcriptiondwell timesand initiation rates varied over the cell cycle . The MDN1 gene was monitored at various stages of the cell cycle , resulting in fluorescence intensity traces during G 1 for PP7 - MDN1 and MDN1 - PP7 ( Fig . 3 , E and F ) . During G 1 , the mean dwell time of PP7 - MDN1 transcripts is T = 770 T 260 s , and the mean dwell time of MDN1 - PP7 is T = 140 T 30 s ( Fig . 3 , G and H ) . From these data , it is possible to directly compute the elongation velocity ac - cording to the equation v ¼ ð L 5 0 − L 3 0 Þ ð T 5 0 − T 3 0 Þ , where L is the length of the PP7 cassette plus the down - stream sequence and T is the dwell time as measured above . The velocity of RNAPII on MDN1 is v = 20 T 8 bases per second , and the termination time is 70 T 41 s . The initiation rates are c = 0 . 16 T 0 . 07 min − 1 for PP7 - MDN1 and c = 0 . 24 T 0 . 1 min − 1 for MDN1 - PP7 . The agreement between initiation rates follows from the processivity of RNAPIIs , which clear the promoter and proceed to termination . In late S / G 2 phase , PP7 - MDN1 was observed to have a much shorter mean dwell time ( T = 310 T 42 s ) and a faster mean initiation rate ( c = 0 . 40 T 0 . 18 min − 1 ) ( Fig . 3I and fig . S3 ) , resulting in a lower bound estimate of the velocity of 46 T 6 . 2 bases per second . This variable dwell time of single RNAPIIs on the MDN1 gene is obscured by pop - ulation averages of the single - molecule data and can be misinterpreted as RNAPII pausing ( figs . S4 and S5 ) . Because POL1p - GLT1 and MDN1 each exhibit uncorrelated initiation events , gene firing is likely determined by a single rate - limiting step . Such a step might be the binding of a trans - acting factor to DNA , so we used two - photon fluorescence cor - relation spectroscopy ( 2PE - FCS ) to determine the abundance and reaction - diffusion properties of the transcription factor Mbp1p ( 17 , 18 ) , which binds the POL1 promoter in vivo ( 2 ) and is necessary and sufficient for correct cell cycle – regulated expression of POL1 ( 19 ) . The 2PE - FCS auto - correlation of Mbp1 - GFP under endogenous regulation is shown along with a fit to a model where Mbp1 - GFP alternates between bound and unbound states ( Fig . 4 and fig . S6 ) ( 20 ) . The time in the unbound state corresponds to three - Fig . 3 . The housekeeping gene MDN1 shows variable elongation rate .

GFP targeted to the nucleus with a nuclear localization sequence ( NLS - GFP ) ( 18 ) shows simple 3D diffusion . The number of Mbp1 - GFP molecules in the nucleus is 350 T 18 . From these data , it is possible to directly com - pute the search time ( t s ) , according to the Berg and von Hippel model of facilitated diffusion ( 22 ) : t s ¼ M N ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 4 D 1D t 1D p ð t 3D þ t 1D Þ ð 3 Þ where M is the number of base pairs in the nu - cleus ( 12 × 10 6 ) , D 1D ( 5 . 1 × 10 5 bp 2 / s ) is the 1D diffusion coefficient measured in vitro ( 21 ) , and N is the number of factors doing the search . The calculated search time is 52 T 8 s , which com - pared to the measured time between initiation events of 46 T 25 s ( Fig . 2E ) . A modified de - scription of facilitated diffusion that postulates that the search regions are determined by the nucleosome - free DNA results in a search time of 84 T 11 s ( fig . S7 ) ( 23 ) . Both models of fa - cilitated diffusion predict a search time that is in quantitative agreement with the direct measure - ment of transcription initiation frequency for the POL1 promoter . Thus , the initiation rate from this active state shows a rate - limiting step that is consistent with the search time for Mbp1p , sug - gesting that every encounter leads to a promoter clearance event . The view of transcription in yeast that emerges from these data is consistent with a model where transcription activation is determined by recruit - ment of a rate - limiting factor , which then assembles the pre - initiation complex ( fig . S7 ) ( 24 , 25 ) . Re - markably for the POL1 promoter , this recruitment process is highly efficient , but the Mbp1p - DNA complex is also dynamic , as is the basal tran - scription machinery ( 26 ) , resulting in single un - correlated transcription events instead of the bursts of transcription observed for other genes ( 8 , 16 , 27 , 28 ) . Moreover , transcription rates in yeast are consistent with a search process occur - ring in a functionally homogeneous nuclear com - partment . The single - factor , single - target search time for Mbp1p in the yeast nucleus is ~ 5 hours . In contrast , the Lac repressor search time in bacte - ria is ~ 300 s ( 21 ) . However , the effective search times are similar , because of the number of fac - tors doing the search ( for LacI , 20 molecules ; for Mbp1 , 350 molecules ) . It is unclear whether the biophysical aspects of the search process are modified in the metazoan nucleus , where many genes are not expressed and chromatin shows substantial compartmentalization . The live - cell approach described in this report , which uses fluctuation analysis to observe the activity of RNAPII and the reaction - diffusion behavior of transcription factors , will be critical in deciphering transcriptional control at single genes operating in their native context .

We report that PGRN bound directly to tumor necrosis factor receptors ( TNFRs ) and disturbed the TNF a - TNFR interaction . PGRN - deficient mice were susceptible to collagen - induced arthritis , and administration of PGRN reversed inflammatory arthritis . Atsttrin , an engineered protein composed of three PGRN fragments , exhibited selective TNFR binding . PGRN and Atsttrin prevented inflammation in multiple arthritis mouse models and inhibited TNF a - activated intracellular signaling . Collectively , these findings demonstrate that PGRN is a ligand of TNFR , an antagonist of TNF a signaling , and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis in mice . They also suggest new potential therapeutic interventions for various TNF a - mediated pathologies and conditions , including rheumatoid arthritis . P rogranulin ( PGRN ) , also known as granulin epithelin precursor ( GEP ) , PC cell – derived growth factor ( PCDGF ) , proepithelin , and acrogranin , is an autocrine growth factor . PGRN contains seven - and - a - half repeats of a cysteine - rich motif ( CX5 - 6CX5CCX8CCX6CCXDX2H - CCPX4CX5 - 6C ; X , any amino acid ) in the order P - G - F - B - A - C - D - E , where A - G are full repeats and P is the half - motif ( 1 ) . PGRN is expressed in rapidly cycling epithelial cells , leukocytes , neu - rons ( 2 ) , and chondrocytes ( 3 ) . Some human can - cers also express PGRN , and PGRN contributes to tumorigenesis in breast cancer , ovarian car - cinoma , and multiple myeloma ( 2 , 4 ) . PGRN plays a criticalrole in a variety of physiologic and disease processes , including early embryogen - esis ( 5 ) , wound healing ( 6 ) , inflammation ( 7 , 8 ) , host defense ( 9 ) , and cartilage development and 22 APRIL 2011 VOL 332 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 478 REPORTS on A p r il 21 , 2 011 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m
