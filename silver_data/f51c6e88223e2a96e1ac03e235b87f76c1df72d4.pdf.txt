Here , we show that N - WASP WH2 domains play a previously unanticipated role in vesicle move - ment by transiently attaching actin ﬁlament barbed ends to the membrane . To dissect the attachment mechanism , we reconstituted the propulsive motility of lipid - coated glass beads , using puriﬁed soluble proteins . N - WASP WH2 mutants assembled actin comet tails and initi - ated movement , but the comet tails catastroph - ically detached from the membrane . When pre - sented on the surface of a lipid - coated bead , WH2 domains were sufﬁcient to maintain comet tail attachment . In v - Src - transformed ﬁbro - blasts , N - WASP WH2 mutants were severely defective in the formation of circular podosome arrays . In addition to creating an attachment force , interactions between WH2 domains and barbed ends may locally amplify signals for dendritic actin nucleation . INTRODUCTION Nucleation of branched actin ﬁlament networks occurs on the cytoplasmic surface of membranes . Actin polymeriza - tion generates force , which drives protrusion of the plasma membrane during cell motility ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , constriction and internalization of the plasma mem - brane during endocytosis ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Merri - ﬁeld et al . , 2005 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) , and the rocketing movement of endosomes and Golgi - derived vesicles ( Kaksonen et al . , 2000 ; Rozelle et al . , 2000 ; Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . These processes are spatially and temporally coordinated by membrane - associated signaling com - plexes , often containing Rho - family GTPases ( e . g . , Cdc42 and Rac ) , phosphoinositides , and members of the WASP / WAVE / SCAR family of nucleation promoting factors . Once activated at the membrane , WASP / WAVE / SCAR proteins directly activate the Arp2 / 3 complex via their con - served central / acidic ( CA ) domain , while the Arp2 / 3 com - plex binds simultaneously to the side of a membrane - proximal actin ﬁlament ( Welch and Mullins , 2002 ) . Delivery of an actin monomer to this prenucleation complex is mediated by the WASP Homology 2 domain ( also called WH2 , W , verprolin homology , or V domain ) , which is adja - cent to the CA domain and is essential for actin nucleation by WASP / WAVE / SCAR proteins ( Hufner et al . , 2001 ; Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . This event generates a new actin ﬁlament , with its fast - growing ‘‘barbed’’ end oriented toward the membrane and its ‘‘pointed’’ end anchored to the Arp2 / 3 complex at the new branch junction . WASP / WAVE / SCAR proteins disso - ciate from the Arp2 / 3 complex during branch formation ( Egile et al . , 2005 ; Martin et al . , 2006 ; Uruno et al . , 2003 ) and presumably remain bound to their activators at the membrane ( e . g . , Cdc42 or Rac and phosphoinositides ) . As inferred from electron micrographs of detergent - extracted lamellipodia ( Bailly et al . , 1999 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) , actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex generates a dense array of free barbed ends that are inti - mately associated with the advancing plasma membrane . Our current understanding of how a dendritic actin net - work interacts with a surface derives primarily from in vitro reconstitution experiments ( Upadhyaya and van Oude - naarden , 2003 ; van der Gucht et al . , 2005 ) . Polystyrene beads containing immobilized Arp2 / 3 activators ( ActA from Listeria monocytogenes , or the mammalian activa - tors , WASP or N - WASP ) assemble a dense ‘‘comet tail’’ of crosslinked actin ﬁlaments and undergo propulsive move - ment in cytoplasmic extracts ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ; Yarar et al . , 1999 ) or in a mixture of puriﬁed proteins ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) . Similar to Listeria comet tails in extracts ( Gerbal Cell 128 , 901 – 913 , March 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 901 et al . , 2000 ; Olbris and Herzfeld , 2000 ) and mammalian cells ( Kuo and McGrath , 2000 ) , comet tails assembled on polystyrene beads remain tightly attached to the bead sur - face ( Cameron et al . , 2001 ; Marcy et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , studies of ActA - coated liposomes and WASP WCA - coated oil droplets rocketing in cytoplasmic extracts indi - cate that actin comet tails exert attachment and compres - sive forces that distort these ﬂuid surfaces ( Boukellal et al . , 2004 ; Giardini et al . , 2003 ; Upadhyaya et al . , 2003 ) . How a dendritic actin network exerts both attachment and compressive forces on a ﬂuid membrane bilayer is a central , unresolved question in the ﬁeld of actin - based motility . Here , we describe a novel biochemical reconsti - tution system to address this question in the context of vesicle movement powered by the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP . Our results support a barbed end capture mechanism that explains how a dendritic actin network can remain persistently attached to a membrane while si - multaneously pushing it forward . N - WASP WH2 domains mediate attachment by capturing barbed ends at the membrane surface , thereby permitting ﬁlament elongation while transiently protecting barbed ends from capping protein . N - WASP WH2 mutants that are defective in barbed end capture ( but not Arp2 / 3 complex activation ) are impaired in their ability to assemble large podosome arrays in v - Src - transformed ﬁbroblasts . WH2 domains thus have multiple functions at the membrane in addition to their well - established role in promoting actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex . RESULTS N - WASP WH2 Domains Localize to the Attachment Zone of Moving Vesicles We initially considered two potential attachment mecha - nisms . In the ﬁrst mechanism , attachment is mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , which transiently links the sides of membrane - proximal ﬁlaments to the CA domain of N - WASP prior to generating a new barbed end . This mechanism , for which there is little direct evidence , has been proposed to mediate attachment of actin comet tails to Listeria and ActA - coated particles ( Giardini et al . , 2003 ; Mogilner and Oster , 2003 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ) . In the second mechanism , attachment is mediated by direct in - teractions between N - WASP and membrane - proximal barbed ends . This mechanism , for which there is also little evidence , is central to ﬁlament end - tracking models of Listeria movement ( Dickinson et al . , 2004 ; Dickinson and Purich , 2002 ) . However , barbed end attachment to N - WASP need not be processive or coupled to ATP hydroly - sis , as proposed in these models . As a third possibility , both side binding and barbed end binding mechanisms are required for attachment . We designed experiments to distinguish among these possibilities . Previous immunoﬂuorescence and immunoelectron mi - croscopy studies indicated that N - WASP localizes asym - metrically on the surface of rocketing vesicles , at the interface between the actin network and the membrane ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . One explanation for N - WASP asym - metry on a ﬂuid membrane bilayer is that N - WASP directly interacts with a component of the actin comet tails ( e . g . , actin itself , the Arp2 / 3 complex , or another structural pro - tein ) , as proposed for ActA - coated liposomes and WASP WCA - coated oil droplets ( Boukellal et al . , 2004 ; Giardini et al . , 2003 ; Upadhyaya et al . , 2003 ) . In principle , these in - teractions could mediate attachment of the actin network to the membrane . Based on this hypothesis , we searched for a candidate ‘‘attachment domain , ’’ operationally deﬁned as the mini - mal N - WASP fragment that localizes to the membrane - actin interface of rocketing vesicles . We labeled a panel of bacterially expressed N - WASP fragments with ﬂuoro - phores ( Figure 1A ) and added them to phorbol ester - stim - ulated Xenopus egg extracts , a well - established system for studying vesicle motility ( Ho et al . , 2004 ; Papayanno - poulos et al . , 2005 ; Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . At the low concentrations used ( 50 nM ) , labeled N - WASP fragments had neither inhibitory nor stimulatory effects on vesicle motility , which is driven in these experiments by unlabeled endogenous N - WASP . We used live imaging to determine whether labeled fragments localized to the membrane - actin interface of moving vesicles , referred to here as the ‘‘attachment zone . ’’ Deletion of the N - terminal region of N - WASP , which fa - cilitated expression in E . coli , had no effect on asymmetric localization , as Alexa488 - labeled N - WASP 151 - 501 local - ized to the attachment zone of every moving vesicle that we observed ( Figure 1B ) . In this experiment , we simulta - neously imaged a rhodamine - labeled fragment com - prising the polybasic and GTPase binding domains ( rhod - BG ) . In contrast to N - WASP 151 - 501 , rhod - BG was symmetrically distributed around the surface of every ves - icle examined ( Figure 1B ) . Thus , interactions with acidic phospholipids and Cdc42 , thought to be essential for the recruitment of N - WASP to endosomal vesicles in the Xenopus extract system ( Ho et al . , 2004 ; Papayannopou - los et al . , 2005 ) , are not sufﬁcient to mediate localization of BG to the attachment zone . We obtained identical results when we swapped ﬂuorophores and imaged rhod - N - WASP 151 - 501 and Alexa488 - BG , either separately or together ( data not shown ) . When the C - terminal WH2 / central / acidic domains of N - WASP were fused to BG , the resulting BG - WCA frag - ment now localized to the attachment zone ( Figure 1C ) , suggesting that an attachment domain lies within the Arp2 / 3 complex - activating region of N - WASP . Given that the Arp2 / 3 complex can simultaneously bind WCA and the side of an actin ﬁlament ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) , it seemed like an excellent candidate for mediating attach - ment , as proposed for Listeria motility ( Giardini et al . , 2003 ; Mogilner and Oster , 2003 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ) . We were therefore surprised that BG - W , which lacks the Arp2 / 3 binding central and acidic domains , strongly local - ized to the attachment zone ( Figure 1C ) . A minimal frag - ment comprising only the polybasic and WH2 domains ( B - W ) also localized to the attachment zone ( Figure 1C ) . 902 Cell 128 , 901 – 913 , March 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . In time - lapse sequences , B - W precisely colocalized with the membrane / actin interface during vesicle movement ( Movie S1 ) , whereas the isolated polybasic , WH2 , and WCA fragments did not localize to vesicles at all ( data not shown ) . The asymmetric localization of all WH2 do - main - containing fragments suggested a novel function for this domain , independent of its essential role in pro - moting actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex . We searched for point mutations in the N - WASP WH2 domains that would selectively abrogate the putative at - tachment function without affecting Arp2 / 3 - promoted ac - tin nucleation . Because N - WASP has two partially redun - dant WH2 domains ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2000 ) , we deleted one of them , providing a construct hereafter referred to as ‘‘WT N - WASP’’ ( Figure 2A ) . We characterized two WH2 domain mutants , K444Q and R438A . Relative to WT N - WASP ( K d = 0 . 9 m M ) , K444Q binds actin monomers with (cid:2) 10 - fold lower afﬁnity ( K d = 10 m M ) , and R438A binds with at least 30 - fold lower afﬁnity ( K d R 30 m M ) , based on ﬂuorescence anisotropy assays ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) ( Figure 2B ) . Despite the signiﬁcant decrease in actin bind - ing afﬁnity , both WH2 mutants had nucleation promoting activity comparable to WT N - WASP ( Figures 2C and S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . Thus , high - afﬁnity actin binding by the WH2 domain is not required for potent nucleation promoting activity , as noted in previous studies of WASP WH2 mutants ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . Strikingly , neither R438A nor K444Q N - WASP ( labeled with Alexa488 ) localized to the attachment zone of rocketing vesicles when added to Xenopus egg ex - tracts ( Figure 2D ) . By contrast , Alexa594 - labeled WT Figure 1 . N - WASP WH2 Domains Localize to the Attachment Zone of Moving Vesicles ( A ) DomainstructureofN - WASPandderivedfragments .

These results are re - markable : single mutations in the WH2 domain , both of which reduce actin binding afﬁnity , abolish asymmetric localization to the actin / membrane interface without af - fecting nucleation promoting activity . Reconstitution of Membrane Movement from Pure Components : WH2 Mutations Induce Catastrophic Detachment of Actin Comet Tails To dissect the mechanism of actin / membrane attach - ment , we compared WT , R438A , and K444Q N - WASP in a novel reconstitution system using puriﬁed components ( Figure 3A ) . Our system is similar to one used previously to study N - WASP - dependent motility of polystyrene beads and Listeria ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Loisel et al . , 1999 ) , with two important differences . First , our motility substrate consists of a lipid bilayer ( 5 : 75 : 20 , PIP2 : PC : PS ) supported on the surface of 2 . 3 m m glass beads . Second , to activate N - WASP , we reconstituted a Cdc42 signaling pathway that includes intersectin , a Cdc42 - speciﬁc guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( Hus - sain et al . , 2001 ) , and prenylated Cdc42 bound to its endogenous inhibitor , RhoGDI ( Hoffman et al . , 2000 ) . In the presence of GTP g S and the soluble Cdc42 / RhoGDI complex , a constitutively active intersectin fragment pro - moted the translocation of N - WASP to the surface of lipid - coated beads ( Figure S2 ) . Following Cdc42 / N - WASP activation , lipid - coated beads were added to a motility mix containing actin , the Arp2 / 3 complex , capping protein , and proﬁlin . Coﬁlin was omitted to prevent disassembly of the actin comet tails . Actin comet tails formed on 100 % of the beads within 5 min , resulting in propulsive motility at 0 . 58 ± 0 . 20 m m / min Figure 2 .

At early time points ( 5 min after mixing components ) , there were no major differences between motility reactions con - taining WT , R438A , or K444Q N - WASP ( Figure 3B ) . The average speed of the WH2 mutants was slightly faster ( R438A , 0 . 85 ± 0 . 26 m m / min , p < 0 . 005 , t test ) or similar ( K444Q , 0 . 64 ± 0 . 12 m m / min ) compared to WT N - WASP ( Figure S3 ) . Within 10 – 30 min , lipid - coated beads containing R438A or K444Q N - WASP spontaneously detached from their comet tails , whereas nearly all of the beads containing WT N - WASP remained attached to their tails ( Figures 3B and 3D ) . Time - lapse movies revealed sudden , cata - strophic separation of the lipid - coated beads from their intact tails ; after detaching , the beads moved randomly under the inﬂuence of Brownian forces and bulk liquid ﬂow ( Figure 3C and Movie S3 ) . Quantiﬁcation of ﬁxed motility reactions demonstrated progressive comet tail detachment over time , with R438A - assembled comet tails detaching more rapidly than K444Q - assembled tails ( Figure 3D ) . Addition of a fresh supply of actin monomers to motility reactions in which 100 % of the lipid - coated beads had lost their tails resulted in comet tail re - forma - tion and movement of 100 % of the beads , and increasing the initial actin concentration from 6 m M to 9 m M delayed comet tail detachment in motility reactions containing R438A and K444Q N - WASP ( Figure S4 ) . Thus , time - dependent comet tail detachment most likely results from the gradual depletion of actin monomers from solution . Our results suggest that actin binding by the WH2 do - main plays a critical role in the attachment mechanism , but they do not rule out an additional requirement for N - WASP binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . To test this pos - sibility directly , we treated motility reactions with the N - WASP CA fragment ( fused to GST ) , a potent competitive inhibitor of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Hufner et al . , 2001 ; Ro - hatgi et al . , 1999 ) . GST - CA rapidly arrested comet tail growth and bead movement , but it had no effect on comet tail attachment ( Figure S5 ) . This result argues against a re - quirement for N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 interactions in the attach - ment mechanism . Barbed End Capture by WH2 Domains Is Necessary and Sufﬁcient to Maintain Comet Tail Attachment WH2 domains bind in a small cleft at the barbed end of an actin monomer ( Chereau et al . , 2005 ; Hertzog et al . , 2004 ) and are thought to transiently interact with ﬁlament barbed ends while promoting elongation ( Egile et al . , 1999 ; Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . Superposition of the WASP WH2 / actin struc - ture and the Holmes ﬁlament model suggested that the barbed end of a ﬁlament could accommodate a WH2 do - main without any steric clashes ( Chereau et al . , 2005 ) . These biochemical and structural properties , together with the inverse correlation between actin binding afﬁnity ( WT > K444Q > R438A , Figure 2B ) and the rate of comet tail detachment ( R438A > K444Q > WT , Figure 3D ) , led us to hypothesize that WH2 - mediated capture of membrane - proximal barbed ends plays a critical role in the attachment mechanism . Barbed end capture could be direct or it could involve WH2 - mediated delivery of ATP - actin monomers . To test the dependence of comet tail attachment on ac - tin barbed ends , we acutely perturbed motility reactions after assembling comet tails for 10 min . Four - fold dilution of motility reactions containing WT N - WASP induced comet tail detachment from (cid:2) 50 % of the lipid - coated beads after 15 min , an effect that was largely suppressed by including actin monomers ( 1 m M ) in the dilution buffer ( Figure 4A ) . By contrast , dilution of motility reactions into actin plus increasing concentrations of capping protein in - duced catastrophic tail detachment , with 100 % detach - ment occurring at 500 nM capping protein . The actin monomer sequestering drug , latrunculin , delayed but did not prevent comet tail detachment induced by excess capping protein ( Figure S6 ) . This dramatic stabilizing ef - fect may be explained , in part , by latrunculin’s ability to prevent the depletion of ATP - actin , which may be required to link ﬁlament barbed ends to membrane - bound WH2 domains . We sought direct evidence for the formation of a com - plex between N - WASP and actin ﬁlament barbed ends in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex . We adapted an imaging - based ﬁlament capture assay ( Bear et al . , 2002 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ) using N - WASP - coated polystyrene beads and Alexa488 phalloidin - stabilized actin ﬁlaments . We quantiﬁed Alexa488 ﬂuorescence on the surface of individual beads as a function of increasing amounts of rhodamine - labeled , latrunculin - stabilized actin mono - mers . Whereas Alexa488 ﬁlaments alone did not stably associate with the N - WASP - coated beads , ﬁlaments were robustly captured in the presence of rhod - actin monomers ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . Binding of Alexa488 ﬁla - ments to N - WASP - coated beads was prevented by cap - ping protein , conﬁrming barbed end association . The inability of immobilized N - WASP to directly capture phal - loidin - stabilized ﬁlaments ( containing primarily ADP and ADP - P i ) may be due to a requirement for ATP - actin , sup - plied here in the form of non - polymerizable latrunculin / actin / ATP complexes . The ability of a WH2 / latrunculin / actin complex to productively interact with a barbed end - like structure has been observed previously in the context of WCA activation of Arp2 / 3 , a functional and possibly structural analog of a barbed end ( Dayel and Mullins , 2004 ) . Filament capture was abrogated by the R438A and K444Q mutations in a manner that correlated with their ac - tin monomer binding afﬁnities ( Figure 4C ) . Quantiﬁcation of bead - associated rhodamine ﬂuorescence as a function of latrunculin / actin provided actin binding curves for WT , R438A , and K444Q N - WASP ( Figure S7 ) that were qualita - tively similar to those obtained in the bulk solution anisot - ropy assay ( Figure 2B ) . We also compared the Cdc42 binding BG fragment with the WH2 - containing BG - W frag - ment ; only the BG - W fragment captured actin ﬁlaments ( Figure S8 ) . Together , these results indicate that a high 906 Cell 128 , 901 – 913 , March 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . surface density of WH2 domains , bound to actin mono - mers , can capture actin ﬁlament barbed ends in the ab - sence of other proteins . We next tested whether barbed end capture by N - WASP WH2 domains is sufﬁcient to mediate attachment of a dendritic actin network to a ﬂuid membrane bilayer . We took advantage of the fact that N - WASP dynamically exchanges between the membrane and solution to ask whether replacement of membrane - bound N - WASP with BG or BG - W fragments could maintain comet tail attach - ment ( Figure 5A ) . Actin comet tails were ﬁrst assembled for 12 min on lipid - coated beads containing activated Cdc42 and Alexa488 N - WASP ( 5 % labeled , ﬁnal concen - tration of 150 nM ) . Addition of either BG or BG - W ( 2 m M ) resulted in the displacement of Alexa488 N - WASP from the beads ( t 1 / 2 (cid:2) 5 min , Figure 5B ) , whereas N - WASP ﬂuorescence increased slightly in control reactions to which buffer was added . As expected , replacement of N - WASP by BG caused 100 % of the comet tails to detach with a time course that paralleled N - WASP dissociation ( Figures 5B and 5C and Movie S4 ) . Remarkably , most of the actin comet tails remained attached to the lipid - coated beads for at least 45 min after addition of BG - W , indicating that WH2 domains are sufﬁcient to mediate comet tail attachment . Comet tail growth was abolished by BG - W ( Figure 5D ) , consistent with a requirement for Arp2 / 3 - promoted nucleation and branching to sustain forward movement . WH2 Mutations Disrupt Podosome Organization in v - Src - Transformed Cells N - WASP promotes the assembly of protrusive actin - based structures called podosomes ( or invadopodia ) in v - Src - transformed ﬁbroblasts ( Mizutani et al . , 2002 ) and breast carcinoma cells ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2005 ) . To test whether WH2 - mediated actin attachment plays a role in podosome assembly and organization , we transduced v - Src + / N - WASP (cid:3) / (cid:3) ﬁbroblasts with retroviruses encoding Figure 4 . Comet Tail Attachment Requires Interactions between WH2 Domains and Actin Filament Barbed Ends ( A ) Motility reactions containing WT N - WASP were diluted 4 - fold ( at t = 10 min ) into buffer alone or buffer containing 1 m M actin plus the indicated concentrations of capping protein ( CP ) . After 15 min , reactions were ﬁxed in 1 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and the percentage of beads with attached tails was determined ( 40 beads counted for each condition ; shown are results expressed as mean ± SD percentages from 4 independent experiments ) . ( B ) Polystyrene beads were coated with N - WASP ( WT , K444Q , and R438A ) and incubated with Alexa488 phalloidin - stabilized actin ﬁlaments ( ± cap - ping protein ) and increasing concentrations of latrunculin - stabilized actin monomers ( 17 % rhod - labeled ) .

Consistent with our earlier results ( Figure 2C ) , the RA / RA mutant was essen - tially identical to wild - type N - WASP in pyrene actin nucle - ation assays ( Figure S9 ) . After retroviral transduction and FACS - sorting , we obtained WT and RA / RA GFP - N - WASP cells that expressed similar levels of GFP - N - WASP and v - Src ( Figure 6A ) . The cells also expressed similar levels of VASP , which has a WH2 - related domain and has been localized to podosomes / invadopodia ( Du - tartre et al . , 1996 ; Spinardi et al . , 2004 ) . Consistent with previous dominant - negative and siRNA experiments ( Mizutanietal . , 2002 ; Yamaguchietal . , 2005 ) , v - Src + / N - WASP (cid:3) / (cid:3) cells were devoid of podosomes , whether left untreated or transduced with a GFP retrovirus ( data not shown ) . By contrast , we observed podosomes in both the WT ( 50 ± 6 % ) and RA / RA cells ( 38 ± 7 % , results expressed as mean ± SD , three independent experi - ments ) . To test for differences in podosome size and orga - nization , we focused on the podosome - containing cells from three independent datasets ( quantiﬁcation was per - formed blind ) . We quantiﬁed the percentage of these cells that contained ‘‘bars’’ ( length / width R 3 ; see Figure 6B ( ii ) , for example ) and ‘‘rings’’ ( contiguous circular arrays of po - dosomes ; see Figure 6B ( i ) , for example ) . Compared to the RA / RA cells , twice as many WT cells had podosome bars or rings ( Figure 6C , p < 0 . 03 , t test ) . Moreover , WT cells were (cid:2) 10 times more likely than RA / RA cells to assemble rings ( Figure 6D , p < 0 . 01 ) . We obtained similar results with a second batch of FACS - sorted cells that expressed higher levels of WT and RA / RA GFP - N - WASP ( data not shown ) . Wemeasuredthesize ( area ) ofindividualbars , rings , and puncta , restricting our analysis to WT and RA / RA cells that had at least one podosome bar or ring . Large podosomes ( > 20 m m 2 ) were (cid:2) 5 times more abundant in WT cells ( Figure 6E ) , although the average number of podosomes per cell was similar for WT and RA / RA cells . We conclude that RA / RA N - WASP is defective in the assembly of large podosome arrays in v - Src - transformed ﬁbroblasts . These results suggest that N - WASP clustering , mediated by WH2 / barbed end interactions , plays a role in the propaga - tion and / or stabilization of extended podosome networks . DISCUSSION The central ﬁnding of this study is that WH2 domains me - diate the dynamic attachment of actin ﬁlament barbed ends to the membrane during N - WASP - driven membrane movement . Highlyconcentratedattheactin / membranein - terface , N - WASP WH2 domains maintaina persistentcon - nection between the dendritic network and the advancing membrane of a rocketing vesicle . The Arp2 / 3 complex or VASP , which protects barbed ends from capping protein via a WH2 - like actin binding domain ( Barzik et al . , 2005 ) , may coordinate attachment and detachment of actin ﬁla - ments to moving Listeria ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ) . VASP ( Bear et al . , 2002 ; Samarin et al . , 2003 ) , along with its recently identiﬁed partner , lamellipo - din ( Krause et al . , 2004 ) , are also likely to be important reg - ulatorsofactinattachmentattheleadingedgeofmigrating cells . In the context of podosome assembly ( Figure 6 ) , VASP and N - WASP clearly have nonredundant functions . Figure 5 .

Multiple lines of biochemical evidence support our pro - posed barbed end attachment mechanism . First , WH2 domains are necessary and sufﬁcient to localize N - WASP fragments to sites of dendritic actin nucleation on the surface of rocketing vesicles ( Figure 1 ) . Second , R438A and K444Q WH2 mutations prevent localization to the attachment zone , yet have no effect on Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation ( Figure 2 ) . Third , in a reconsti - tuted membrane motility system , WH2 domains are nec - essary ( Figure 3 ) and sufﬁcient ( Figure 5 ) to maintain comet tail attachment to lipid - coated beads . Fourth , high concentrations of capping protein accelerate comet tail detachment ( Figures 4A and S6 ) . Fifth , immobilized ac - tin monomer / WH2 complexes capture actin ﬁlament barbed ends in the absence of other proteins ( Figure 4B ) . Model for WH2 - Mediated Attachment of Actin Filament Barbed Ends to the Membrane Our model for actin / membrane attachment extends the dendritic nucleation model ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) by Figure 6 .

( E ) Areas of podosome rings , bars , and puncta were measured in 50 randomly selected WT and RA / RA cells , all of which contained at least one po - dosome bar or ring . Areas were binned as shown ( for reference , the ring in Figure 6B has an area of 64 m m 2 , whereas the bar has an area of 20 m m 2 ) . Cell 128 , 901 – 913 , March 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 909 considering the fate of barbed ends at the membrane surface ( Figure 7A ) , which cycle through elongation , at - tachment , and release steps until ﬁlament growth and membrane attachment are ultimately terminated by cap - ping protein . Reversible capture of a membrane - proximal barbed end by WH2 or WH2 / actin establishes the molec - ular link between the dendritic network and the mem - brane . It is not clear whether barbed end capture occurs primarily via free WH2 domains or WH2 / actin monomers . Based on the preference of WASP WH2 for ATP - actin ( 5 - fold higher binding afﬁnity relative to ADP - actin ) ( Chereau et al . , 2005 ) , it is possible that barbed end binding by free WH2 domains is sensitive to the nucleotide state of the terminal actin subunit . This effect may be exacerbated by the R438A and K444Q mutations , leading to cata - strophic detachment of the actin network as the concen - tration of ATP - actin declines in the in vitro motility assay . A barbed end attachment model may seem counterintu - itive given the high dissociation rate of WH2 from barbed ends in solution ( 2500 s (cid:3) 1 if similar to the proﬁlin - barbed end dissociation rate , Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . This dissoci - ation rate has not been measured , but it must be fast be - cause the rate of barbed end polymerization is only slightly decreased by saturating concentrations of WH2 - contain - ing peptides ( Egile et al . , 1999 ; Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . Never - theless , in the context of a dendritic actin network at - tached to a membrane surface , rebinding of a free barbed end to a WH2 domain or WH2 / actin complex is likely to be rapid . First , the surface density ( or ‘‘local con - centration’’ ) of N - WASP on moving lipid - coated beads is high , estimated from ﬂuorescence measurements to be (cid:2) 50 , 000 molecules per m m 2 , with a maximum distance between N - WASP molecules of (cid:2) 5 nm ( unpublished re - sults ) . Second , actin ﬁlaments in the attachment zone are crosslinked in a dendritic network , and thus their movement is highly constrained . Ligand rebinding effects between membrane - associated N - WASP and mem - brane - proximal barbed ends most likely drive the attach - ment interaction , despite the low afﬁnity of WH2 domains for ﬁlament barbed ends in solution . Our model resembles ﬁlament end - tracking models for Listeria motility ( Dickinson et al . , 2004 ; Dickinson and Pu - rich , 2002 ) in that barbed ends , rather than ﬁlament sides or nascent branches , mediate attachment to the mem - brane . A key difference , however , is that WH2 domains need not act as processive end - tracking proteins depen - dent on ATP hydrolysis by actin ( although WH2 / barbed end afﬁnity may be modulated by ATP hydrolysis ) . Individ - ual barbed ends can dissociate from the membrane be - cause attachment is mediated by a multivalent array of hundreds or thousands of crosslinked ﬁlaments . Disrup - tion of WH2 / barbed end attachment interactions may be rate - limiting for vesicle movement , as suggested by re - cent experimental ( Soo and Theriot , 2005 ) and computa - tional ( Alberts and Odell , 2004 ) studies of Listeria move - ment . The increased speed of lipid - coated beads driven by R438A N - WASP before they detach is consistent with this idea ( Figure S3 ) . Figure 7 . Dual Role of WH2 / Barbed End Interactions : Membrane Attachment and Signal Ampliﬁcation ( A ) Membrane - proximal barbed ends encounter a high local concentration of N - WASP / Cdc42 and enter a cycle of elongation , attachment , and re - lease . Attachment of the dendritic network occurs when a critical number of ﬁlament barbed ends interact with WH2 domains . Upon dissociation of theattachmentcomplex , rapid rebinding canoccur becauseof thehighdensityofbarbed endsandN - WASPandtheinability ofactinﬁlamentsinthe dendritic network to rapidly diffuse away . ( B ) Nascentbarbedendscreatedbydendriticnucleation ( i ) cancaptureN - WASP / Cdc42complexesthatdiffusealongthemembrane ( ii ) . Subsequent nucleation and branch formation locally increases the number of barbed ends , which in turn concentrates more N - WASP molecules ( iii ) . 910 Cell 128 , 901 – 913 , March 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . Capture of Diffusing N - WASP Molecules by Nascent Barbed Ends : A Potential Mechanism for Signal Ampliﬁcation In the context of a rocketing vesicle , WH2 domains are necessary and sufﬁcient to localize N - WASP fragments to membrane sites enriched in nascent barbed ends ( Fig - ures 1C and 2D ) . Although we have focused primarily on attachment of the actin network to moving vesicles , our results imply that barbed ends can reciprocally capture a pool of diffusing N - WASP molecules at membrane sites of dendritic actin nucleation . This suggests a mechanism for localized signal ampliﬁcation , which is likely defective in WH2 mutants ( Figure 7B ) . Reversible capture of diffus - ing N - WASP molecules by nascent barbed ends increases the frequency of local nucleation and branching events , resulting in the expansion of the dendritic network . The reduced number of large podosome arrays assembled by RA / RA N - WASP ( Figure 6 ) is consistent with this pro - posal . Although the mechanism of podosome assembly is largely unknown , we speculate that N - WASP capture by nascent barbed ends is a critical determinant of podo - some expansion , fusion and / or fragmentation . Similarly , WH2 - mediated capture of WAVE / SCAR proteins by na - scent barbed ends may locally amplify actin nucleation signals at the leading edge of moving cells . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression , Puriﬁcation , and Fluorescent Labeling N - WASP fragments were ampliﬁed by PCR from full - length rat N - WASP and mini - N - WASP ( BG - WCA ) ( Prehoda et al . , 2000 ) and ex - pressed as His 6 - HA - tagged fusion proteins in E . coli ( all constructs veriﬁed by DNA sequencing ) . After Ni - NTA puriﬁcation , the His 6 tag wascleavedwithTEVprotease . Proteinswerefurther puriﬁedby chro - matography over HiTRAP S , Q , or heparin columns ( Amersham ) . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) and labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) , Alexa488 - NHS , or rhodamine - NHS ( Molecular Probes ) ( Isambert et al . , 1995 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex was puriﬁed from bovine brain ( Egile et al . , 1999 ) . Capping protein was expressed in E . coli and puriﬁed as described ( Palmgren etal . , 2001 ) . Cdc42 / RhoGDI complex was ex - pressed and puriﬁed as described ( Hoffman et al . , 2000 ) . Intersectin DH - PH was expressed in E . coli ( Zamanian and Kelly , 2003 ) . Proﬁlin ( puriﬁedfromA . castellanii ) wasagiftfromMarkDayelandDycheMul - lins ( UCSF ) . GST - CA ( derived from human N - WASP and expressed in E . coli ) was a gift from Bill Brieher and Tim Mitchison ( Harvard Medical School ) . ForﬂuorescentlabelingofN - WASPfragments , maleimidedyes ( Mo - lecular Probes ) were added at a 20 - fold molar excess and incubated for 2 hr at RT or overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . Reactions were quenched with 5mM b - mercaptoethanolfor15min , andﬂuorescentproteinswerepu - riﬁed over HiTRAP S , Q , or heparin columns . For ﬂuorescence anisot - ropy assays , Oregon Green - labeled WCA proteins were puriﬁed by S200 gel ﬁltration chromatography . Fluorescence anisotropy was measured using an ANALYST AD ﬂuorescence plate reader . WT and mutantOregonGreen - labeledWCA ( 100nM ) wereequilibratedwithin - creasing concentrations of actin monomers , and anisotropy data were ﬁt to a quadratic binding equation to determine the K d . Attachment Zone Localization Assay Vesicle motility reactions in Xenopus egg extracts were performed as described ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . Fluorescence and phase contrast im - ages were acquired for (cid:2) 50 rocketing vesicles ( Olympus IX70 micro - scope ; Coolsnap HQ CCD camera ) . Image analysis was performed with ImageJ . Reconstitution of Membrane Movement Liposomes ( 5 : 75 : 25 , PIP2 : PC : PS ) were fused to the surface of glass beads ( Bangs laboratories , 2 . 3 m m diameter ) to create a supported lipid bilayer . Lipid - coated beads were incubated with 1 . 5 m M Cdc42 / RhoGDI complex , 2 m M DH - PH , and 100 m M GTP g S for 10 min at RT , followed by addition of 1 . 5 m M N - WASP for 10 min . Motility reac - tions were initiated by diluting the suspension of N - WASP / Cdc42 / lipid - coated glass beads 10 - fold into motility buffer ( 10 mM imidazole [ pH 7 . 0 ] , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM EGTA , 5 mg / ml BSA , 0 . 2 % methylcellulose , 5 mM TCEP , 1 mM ATP , 7 . 5 mM creatine phosphate , 1 . 25 mM DABCO ) containing the following proteins : 6 m M G - actin , 0 . 075 m M Arp2 / 3 , 0 . 05 m M capping protein , 2 m M proﬁlin . Additional details are provided in the Supplemental Data . Actin Filament Capture Assay Polystyrene beads ( 2 . 0 m m , Polysciences ) were coated with 1 m M N - WASP in F - buffer ( 10 mM imidazole [ pH 7 ] , 0 . 05 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1mMEGTA ) for1hr , washed , andstoredin1mg / mlBSA . Actin ( 8 m M ) was polymerized in F - buffer for 2 hr and stabilized with 6 m M Alexa488 phalloidin to give ‘‘Alexa488 ﬁlaments . ’’ N - WASP beads ( 5 . 73 3 10 8 beads / ml ) were rotated with Alexa488 ﬁlaments ( 4 m M ) in the presence of varying concentrations of rhod - actin monomers ( stabilized with a 10 - fold molar excess of latrunculin ) . After 10 min , the suspension was diluted 5 - fold into F - buffer containing 1 mg / ml BSA . Randomlychosen beads ( 15 - 20 ) were imaged by phase contrast and ﬂuorescence microscopy .
