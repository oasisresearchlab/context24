Carbonic anhydrases ( CAs ; also known as carbonate dehydratases EC 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ) are ubiquitous metalloenzymes present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that are encoded by four evolutionarily unrelated gene families . These are the α ‑CAs ( present in vertebrates , bacteria , algae and cytoplasm of green plants ) ; the β ‑CAs ( predominantly in bacteria , algae and chloroplasts of monodicotyle‑ dons and dicotyledons ) ; the γ ‑CAs ( mainly in archaea and some bacteria ) ; and the δ ‑CAs ( present in some marine diatoms ) 1 – 7 . In mammals , 16 α ‑CA isozymes or CA‑related proteins have been described ( TABLE 1 ) , with different catalytic activity , subcellular localization and tissue distribution 8 – 18 . There are five cytosolic forms ( CA I , CA II , CA III , CA VII and CA XIII ) , five membrane‑ bound isozymes ( CA IV , CA IX , CA XII , CA XIV and CA XV ) , two mitochondrial forms ( CA VA and CA VB ) , and a secreted CA isozyme ( CA VI ) 19 – 25 . CAs catalyse a simple physiological reaction ( BOX 1 ) : the conversion of CO 2 to the bicarbonate ion and pro‑ tons . The active site of most CAs contains a zinc ion ( Zn 2 + ) , which is essential for catalysis . The CA reaction is involved in many physiological and pathological pro‑ cesses , including respiration and transport of CO 2 and bicarbonate between metabolizing tissues and lungs ; pH and CO 2 homeostasis ; electrolyte secretion in vari‑ ous tissues and organs ; biosynthetic reactions ( such as gluconeogenesis , lipogenesis and ureagenesis ) ; bone resorption ; calcification ; and tumorigenicity 8 – 18 . Many of the CA isozymes involved in these processes are important therapeutic targets with the potential to be inhibited to treat a range of disorders including oedema , glaucoma , obesity , cancer , epilepsy and osteoporosis . Two main classes of CA inhibitors ( CAIs ) are known : the metal‑complexing anions and the unsubstituted sulphonamides and their bioisosteres — for example , sulphamates and sulphamides compounds 1 – 25 ( FIG . 1 ; TABLE 1 ) . These inhibitors bind to the Zn 2 + ion of the enzyme either by substituting the non‑protein zinc ligand to generate a tetrahedral adduct or by addition to the metal coordination sphere to generate a trigonal‑ bipyramidal species 1 – 7 ( FIG . 2 ) . At least 25 clinically used drugs have been reported to possess significant CA inhibitory properties ( discussed below ) , in addition to many other derivatives belonging to the sulphonamide , sulphamate or sulphamide families 1 – 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 19 – 25 . Furthermore , the potential use of CAIs to fight infec‑ tions caused by protozoa , fungi and bacteria has recently emerged as a new research direction . CAs belonging to various families were cloned and characterized in many such organisms ( such as Plasmodium falciparum , Helicobacter pylori , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans ) 26 – 34 and have been shown to be crucial for the virulence , growth or acclimatization of the parasite . In addition , impor‑ tant advances have been achieved in the understanding of CA activation by several classes of activators 35 – 41 .

Carbonic anhydrases : novel therapeutic applications for inhibitors and activators Claudiu T . Supuran Abstract | Carbonic anhydrases ( CAs ) , a group of ubiquitously expressed metalloenzymes , are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes , including gluconeogenesis , lipogenesis , ureagenesis , tumorigenicity and the growth and virulence of various pathogens . In addition to the established role of CA inhibitors ( CAIs ) as diuretics and antiglaucoma drugs , it has recently emerged that CAIs could have potential as novel anti - obesity , anticancer and anti - infective drugs . Furthermore , recent studies suggest that CA activation may provide a novel therapy for Alzheimer’s disease . This article discusses the biological rationale for the novel uses of inhibitors or activators of CA activity in multiple diseases , and highlights progress in the development of specific modulators of the relevant CA isoforms , some of which are now being evaluated in clinical trials . R E V I E W S 168 | FEBruAry 2008 | VOluME 7 www . nature . com / reviews / drugdisc © 200 8 Nature Publishing Group Such compounds might lead to pharmacological agents that have the potential to treat Alzheimer’s disease , ageing and other conditions involving memory deficits 40 . Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors CAIs include the classical inhibitors acetazolamide ( com‑ pound 1 ) , methazolamide ( compound 2 ) , ethoxzolamide ( compound 3 ) , sulthiame ( compound 4 ) and dichloro‑ phenamide ( compound 5 ) . CAIs also include more recent drugs / investigational agents such as dorzolamide ( compound 6 ) , brinzolamide ( compound 7 ) , indisulam ( compound 8 ) , topiramate ( compound 9 ) , zonisamide ( compound 10 ) , sulpiride ( compound 11 ) , COuMATE ( compound 12 ) , EMATE ( compound 13 ) , celecoxib ( compound 14 ) , valdecoxib ( compound 15 ) and saccharin ( compound 16 ) ( FIG . 1 ; TABLE 1 ) . Derivatives 17 and 18 are investigational agents for targeting the tumour‑associated isoform CA IX ( see later in the text ) . Many of these compounds were initially developed years ago during the search for diuretics , among which the thiazides , compounds 19a – e , as well as derivatives 20 – 25 are still widely clinically used 2 , 3 ( FIG . 1 ) . However , some of these enzyme inhibitors could also be used for the systemic treatment of glaucoma ( see below ) , and more recently , newer derivatives have been discovered that have the potential as topical antiglaucoma agents , as well as anti‑ tumour , anti‑obesity or anti‑infective drugs 1 – 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 – 26 . The inhibitory effects of some of these clinically used drugs against the mammalian isoforms CA I – XIV — of human or mouse origin — are shown in TABLE 1 . As specific isozymes are responsible for different bio‑ logical responses , the diverse inhibition profiles of the various isozymes may explain the different actual and potential clinical applications of the CAIs , which range from diuretics and antiglaucoma agents , to anticancer , anti‑obesity and anti‑epileptic drugs . However , a crucial problem in CAI design is related to the high number of isoforms , their diffuse localization in many tissues and organs ( TABLE 2 ) , and the lack of isozyme selectivity of the presently available inhibitors . It can be observed that Table 1 | Inhibition data with selected sulphonamides / sulphamates / sulphamides 1 – 25 against isozymes I – XIV * K I ( nm ) Isozyme ( h = human , m = mouse ) hCA I ‡ hCA II ‡ hCA III ‡ hCA IV ‡ hCA VA ‡ hCA VB ‡ hCA VI ‡ hCA VII ‡ hCA IX § hCA XII § mCA XIII ‡ hCA XIV ‡ 1 250 12 2 × 10 5 74 63 54 11 2 . 5 25 5 . 7 17 41 2 50 14 7 × 10 5 6 , 200 65 62 10 2 . 1 27 3 . 4 19 43 3 25 8 1 × 10 6 93 25 19 43 0 . 8 34 22 50 2 . 5 4 374 9 6 . 3 × 10 5 95 81 91 134 6 43 56 1 , 450 1 , 540 5 1 , 200 38 6 . 8 × 10 5 15 , 000 630 21 79 26 50 50 23 345 6 50 , 000 9 7 . 7 × 10 5 8 , 500 42 33 10 3 . 5 52 3 . 5 18 27 7 45 , 000 3 1 . 1 × 10 5 3 , 950 50 30 0 . 9 2 . 8 37 3 . 0 10 24 8 31 15 10 , 400 65 79 23 47 122 24 3 . 4 11 106 9 250 10 7 . 8 × 10 5 4 , 900 63 30 45 0 . 9 58 | | 3 . 8 47 1 , 460 10 56 35 2 . 2 × 10 6 8 , 590 20 6 , 033 89 117 5 . 1 11 , 000 430 5 , 250 11 12 , 000 40 10 , 600 6 . 5 × 10 5 174 18 0 . 8 3 , 630 46 3 . 9 295 110 12 3 , 450 21 7 . 0 × 10 5 24 765 720 653 23 34 12 1 , 050 755 13 37 10 6 . 5 × 10 5 NT NT NT NT NT 30 7 . 5 NT NT 14 50 , 000 21 7 . 4 × 10 4 880 794 93 94 2 , 170 16 18 98 689 15 54 , 000 43 7 . 8 × 10 4 1 , 340 912 88 572 3 , 900 27 13 425 107 16 18 , 540 5 , 950 1 . 0 × 10 6 7 , 920 10 , 060 7 , 210 935 10 103 633 12 , 100 773 17 1 , 300 45 1 . 3 × 10 6 650 134 76 145 18 24 5 76 33 18 4 , 000 21 3 . 1 × 10 5 60 88 70 65 15 14 7 21 13 19a 328 290 7 . 9 × 10 5 427 4 , 225 603 3 , 655 5 , 010 367 355 3 , 885 4 , 105 20 35 , 000 1 , 260 NT NT NT NT NT NT NT NT NT NT 21 54 , 000 2 , 000 6 . 1 × 10 5 216 750 312 1 , 714 2 . 1 320 5 . 4 15 5 , 432 22 348 138 1 . 1 × 10 4 196 917 9 1 , 347 2 . 8 23 4 . 5 15 4 , 130 23 51 , 900 2 , 520 2 . 3 × 10 5 213 890 274 1 , 606 0 . 23 36 10 13 4 , 950 24 62 65 3 . 2 × 10 6 564 499 322 245 513 420 261 550 52 25 4 , 930 6 , 980 3 . 4 × 10 6 303 700 NT NT NT 25 . 8 21 . 2 2 , 570 250 * The isoforms CA VIII , X and XI are devoid of catalytic activity and probably do not bind sulphonamides as they do not contain Zn 2 + ions . ‡ Full - length enzyme . § Catalytic domain . | | The data against the full - length enzyme is of 1 , 590 nM .

Other isozymes , however , such as CA I , IV , VA , VB and XIV show less propensity to be inhibited by these com‑ pounds , with inhibition constants in the nanomolar to micromolar range . This leaves CA III as the only isoform that is not susceptible to inhibition by sulphonamides or sulphamates . Few of the derivatives 1 – 16 ( FIG . 1 ; TABLE 1 ) show selectivity for a specific isoform : the classical inhibi‑ tors , such as compounds 1 – 5 , and the topically acting antiglaucoma sulphonamides 6 and 7 together with indisulam 8 , are promiscuous CAIs , with strong affini‑ ties for isoforms II , VA , VB , VI , VII , IX , XII , XIII and XIV 7 – 18 . Topiramate ( compound 9 ) is a subnanomolar CA VII inhibitor but it also effectively inhibits isoforms II , VB and XII 7 – 18 . Zonisamide ( compound 10 ) shows a good affinity for CA IX but appreciably inhibits also CA II and VA , while having lower affinities for the other isoforms . Sulpiride ( compound 11 ) is a potent CA VI and CA XII inhibitor and shows lower affinity for other isoforms . Valdecoxib ( compound 15 ) is a strong CA XII inhibitor 7 – 18 , whereas saccharin ( compound 16 ) is a CA VII‑specific inhibitor ( K I of 10 nM against this isoform and much higher for the other CAs ) 19 . Progress in the design of CA‑selective and isozyme‑ specific CAIs has recently been made . Owing to the extracellular location of some CA isozymes , such as CA IV , IX , XII and XIV ( TABLE 2 ) , it is possible to design membrane‑impermeant CAIs , which would therefore specifically inhibit membrane‑associated CAs without interacting with the cytosolic or mitochondrial isoforms . This possibility has been explored through the design of positively charged sulphonamides that generally incorporate pyridinium moieties , of which compound 18 is a representative 20 – 22 . The inhibitors obtained in this way showed nanomolar affinities for CA II as well as CA IV and CA IX , and , more importantly , they were unable to cross the plasma membranes in vivo 20 – 22 . This new class of potent , positively charged CAIs , was able to discriminate between the membrane‑bound and the cytosolic isozymes , selectively inhibiting only CA IV , in two model systems 20 – 22 . Another approach for the design of isoform‑selective CAIs exploited the presence of an Ala65 amino‑acid residue , which is present only in the ubiquitous CA II mammalian isoform 23 . Compared with topiramate , its sulphamide analogue is a 210‑times less potent inhibitor of isozyme CA II , but effectively inhibits isozymes CA VA , VB , VII , XIII and XIV ( K I s in the range of 21 – 35 nM ) . The weak binding of the sulphamide analogue of topiramate to CA II was shown to be due to a clash between one methyl group of the inhibitor with the Ala65 amino‑acid residue , which might therefore be exploited for the design of compounds with lower affinity for this isoform 23 . A further approach for selectively inhibiting the tumour‑associated isoforms CA IX ( and XII ) present in hypoxic tumour tissues envisaged bioreductive prodrugs that are activated by hypoxia 24 , 25 . The chosen strategy was to use the disulphide bond as a bioreducible Box 1 | Mechanism of action of carbonic anhydrases Carbonic anhydrases ( CAs ) catalyse the following reaction : The metal ion ( which is a Zn 2 + ion in all α ‑CAs investigated up to now ) is essential for catalysis 1 – 8 . X‑ray crystallographic data show that the ion is situated at the bottom of a 15 Å deep active‑site cleft ( shown as a pink sphere in the figure below ; left panel ) , and is coordinated by three histidine residues ( His94 , His96 and His119 ; shown in green in the figure ) and a water molecule / hydroxide ion 1 – 8 . The histidine cluster involved in the proton‑shuttling processes between the active site and the environment , comprising residues His64 , His4 , His3 , His17 , His15 and His10 , is also evidenced . Amino‑acid residues 92 and 131 involved in the binding of many sulphonamide / sulphamate inhibitors are shown in yellow 2 , 3 . The zinc‑bound water is also engaged in hydrogen‑bond interactions with the hydroxyl moiety of Thr199 , which in turn is bridged to the carboxylate moiety of Glu106 ; these interactions enhance the nucleophilicity of the zinc‑bound water molecule , and orient the substrate ( CO 2 ) in a favourable location for nucleophilic attack 1 – 8 ( figure , right panel ) . The active form of the enzyme is the basic one , with hydroxide bound to Zn 2 + ( a ) . This strong nucleophile attacks the CO 2 molecule that is bound in a hydrophobic pocket in its neighbourhood ( the elusive substrate‑binding site comprises residues Val121 , Val143 and Leu198 in the case of the human isozyme CA II ) ( b ) , leading to the formation of bicarbonate coordinated to Zn 2 + ( c ) . The bicarbonate ion is then displaced by a water molecule and liberated into solution , leading to the acid form of the enzyme , with water coordinated to Zn 2 + ( d ) , which is catalytically inactive 1 – 8 . To regenerate the basic form ( a ) , a proton transfer reaction from the active site to the environment takes place , which may be assisted either by active‑site residues ( such as His64 , the proton shuttle in isozymes I , II , IV , VI , VII , IX and XII – XIV among others ) or by buffers present in the medium . The process may be schematically represented by reactions 2 and 3 : The rate‑limiting step in catalysis is reaction 3 , that is , the proton transfer that regenerates the zinc‑hydroxide species of the enzyme 1 – 8 . In the catalytically very active isozymes , such as CA II , IV , VI , VII , IX , XII , XIII and XIV , the process is assisted by a histidine residue placed at the entrance of the active site ( His64 ) , or by a cluster of histidines ( figure , left panel ) , which protrudes from the rim of the active site to the surface of the enzyme , thus assuring efficient proton‑transfer pathways 1 – 8 . This may explain why CA II is one of the most active enzymes known ( with a k cat / K m of 1 . 5 x 10 8 M – 1 s – 1 ) , approaching the limit of diffusion‑controlled processes 1 – 8 .

A high - ceiling ( loop ) diuretic inhibits the kidney’s ability to reabsorb sodium in the ascending loop . This leads to an increased loss of sodium and water in the urine , as water normally follows sodium back into the extracellular fluid . function . The reducing conditions present in hypoxic tumours , in combination with the presence of the redox protein thioredoxin 1 , mediates the reduction of the disulphide bond with the formation of thiols 24 , 25 . The reduced compounds ( thiols ) are less bulky and show excellent CA inhibitory activity ( in the low nanomolar range ) compared with the corresponding sterically hin‑ dered disulphides , which have difficulty entering the limited space of the enzyme active site 24 , 25 . CAIs as diuretics CAs are highly abundant in the kidney , and the isoforms present in this organ play a crucial function in at least three physiological processes : the acid – base homeostasis balance ( by secreting and excreting protons , due to the CO 2 hydration reaction catalysed by these enzymes ) ; the bicarbonate reabsorption process ; and the nH 4 + out‑ put 42 , 43 . Acetazolamide ( compound 1 ) was the first non‑ mercurial diuretic to be used clinically in 1956 ( REF . 2 ) . It represents the prototype of a class of pharmacological agents with relatively limited therapeutic use , but which played a major role in the development of fundamental renal physiology and pharmacology , and in the design of many of the current widely used diuretic agents , such as the thiazide and the high - ceiling ( loop ) diuretic . Following the administration of a CAI , such as acetazolamide , the urine volume increases and becomes alkaline 2 , 42 . Increased bicarbonate is eliminated into the urine , together with na + and K + as accompanying cations , whereas the amount of chloride excreted is diminished . This sequence of events is due to the inhibition of CA in the proximal tubule , which leads to the inhibition of H + secretion by this segment of the nephron . Inhibition of cytosolic ( CA II ) and membrane‑bound ( CA IV , XII and CA XIV ) enzymes seems to be involved in the diuretic effects of the sulphonamides 2 , 43 . The net effect of these processes is the transport of sodium bicarbonate from the tubular lumen to the interstitial space , followed by movement of the isotonically obligated water , and augmented diuresis . Acetazolamide , methazolamide ( compound 2 ) , ethox‑ zolamide ( compound 3 ) and dichlorophenamide ( com‑ pound 5 ) are used to treat oedema due to congestive heart failure and for drug‑induced oedema 42 , 43 . Many of the other diuretics , such as the benzothiadiazines ( compounds 19a – e ; for example , chlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide ) ; quinethazone ( compound 20 ) ; metolazone ( compound 21 ) ; chlorthalidone ( compound 22 ) ; indapamide ( compound 23 ) ; furosemide ( compound 24 ) ; and bumetanide ( compound 25 ) act as CA inhibi‑ tors with varying efficiencies 2 , 3 , 42 ( FIG . 1 ) . This is to be expected , as all of them have unsubstituted primary sulphonamide moieties acting as effective zinc - binding moieties 19 . CAIs as drugs for eye disorders Glaucoma is a chronic , degenerative eye disease , char‑ acterised by high intraocular pressure ( IOP ) that causes irreversible damage to the optic nerve head , resulting in the progressive loss of visual function and eventually blindness 44 – 46 . Studies on the chemistry and dynamics of aqueous humour have identified the main constituent of this secretion to be sodium bicarbonate 1 , 2 , 44 – 46 . CAs were identified in the anterior uvea of the eye and were shown to be responsible for the bicarbonate secretion . CAIs represent the most physiological treatment of glaucoma , as by inhibiting the ciliary‑process enzyme — the sulphonamide susceptible isozyme CA II ( TABLE 1 ) — the rate of bicarbonate and aqueous humour secretion is reduced , resulting in a 25 – 30 % decrease in IOP 44 – 51 . Indeed , systemic acetazolamide ( compound 1 ) , meth‑ azolamide ( compound 2 ) , ethoxzolamide ( compound 3 ) or dichlorophenamide ( compound 4 ) are extensively used to treat this disease 2 , 45 . The best‑studied drug is acetazolamide , which is frequently administered long‑ term owing to its efficient reduction of IOP , minimal toxicity and ideal pharmacokinetic properties . However , as CAs are ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates , the systemic administration of sulphonamides leads to nonspecific CA inhibition and is associated with unde‑ sired side effects , including numbness and tingling of extremities ; metallic taste ; depression ; fatigue ; malaise ; weight loss ; decreased libido ; gastrointestinal irritation ; metabolic acidosis ; renal calculi ; and transient myo‑ pia . The development of water‑soluble sulphonamide CAIs to be used as eye drops began in the 1990s , and by 1995 the first such pharmacological agent , dorzola‑ mide ( compound 6 ) , was launched 45 by Merck under the tradename Trusopt . A second structurally similar compound , brinzolamide ( compound 7 ) , has also been approved ( by Alcon under the tradename Azopt ) for the topical treatment of glaucoma 45 . Dorzolamide and brinzolamide are potent water‑soluble CAIs that are sufficiently liposoluble to penetrate the cornea , and may be administered topically as the hydro‑ chloride salt ( at a pH of 5 . 5 ) or as the free base , respec‑ tively 45 . The two drugs are effective in reducing IOP and show fewer side effects as compared with systemically Figure 2 | Mechanisms of inhibition of carbonic anhydrase . a | Unsubstituted sulphonamides and their bioisosteres bind to the Zn 2 + ion of the enzyme by substituting the non - protein zinc ligand to generate a tetrahedral adduct . b | Anionic inhibitors add to the metal coordination sphere , generating trigonal - bipyramidal species .

The observed side effects include sting‑ ing , burning or reddening of the eye , blurred vision and pruritus , which are probably due to the acidic pH of the dorzolamide eyedrops solution . Also , a bitter taste is experienced with both systemic as well as topical CAIs , which is probably due to drug‑laden lachrymal fluid draining into the oropharynx and inhibiting CAs present in the saliva ( CA VI ) and taste buds ( CA II and CA VI ) with the consequent accumulation of bicarbo‑ nate . Therefore , novel , topically effective CAIs as possible antiglaucoma agents are being investigated 46 . One recent approach involved attaching water‑solubilizing moieties and ring‑system derivatives to aromatic and heterocyclic sulphonamides , which produced compounds that were two to three times more effective than dorzolamide in lowering IOP in rabbits 46 – 51 . These compounds were water‑soluble ( as hydrochlorides , triflates or trifluoro‑ acetates ) , potent human CA II inhibitors , penetrated the cornea and significantly lowered IOP in both normo‑ tensive and glaucomatous rabbits 46 – 51 . The use of CAIs in the treatment of macular oedema is based on the observation that systemically administered acetazolamide ( sodium salt ) is effective in the treatment of this condition 52 . Similar efficiency has also recently been reported for topical administration of dorzolamide and brinzolamide 45 . It is generally assumed that the dis‑ appearance of oedema and improvement of visual func‑ tion are independent of the hypotensive activity of the sulphonamide , due to direct effects on the circulation in the retina . Acetazolamide , dorzolamide or brinzolamide probably act as local vasodilators , improving blood flow in this organ and consequently clearing metabolic waste products and drusen . Vision following such treatment ( in early phases of the disease ) is markedly improved 45 , 52 . Gao et al . 53 recently reported that the slow cytosolic isozyme CA I mediates haemorrhagic retinal and cerebral vascular permeability through activation of prekallikrein and generation of the highly active serine protease factor XIIa .

Therefore , as suggested by the authors , CA I inhibition might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of these conditions 53 . In fact , potent CA I inhibitors are currently available 54 . Some of the membrane‑associated isoforms , such as CA IV , IX and XII , have also been considered as possible targets of the antiglaucoma sulphonamides 55 – 57 . The bovine CA IV isozyme was shown to be susceptible to inhibition by most sulphonamides and sulphamates , with K I s in the low nanomolar range 55 . However , the corresponding human isoform , CA IV , shows different behaviour , with some drugs , such as acetazolamide , ethoxzolamide and sulthiame , acting as effective inhibitors , whereas other antiglaucoma agents , such as methazolamide , dichlorophenamide , dorzolamide and brinzolamide , act as weak inhibitors 56 ( TABLE 1 ) , which suggests that it is improbable that CA IV plays a role in aqueous humor secretion , as it is so weakly inhibited by most antiglaucoma sulphonamides . However , CA XII ( but not CA IX ) was recently shown to be highly overexpressed in the eyes of patients with glaucoma , and probably plays an important role in the elevated IOP characteristic of the disease 57 . we have subsequently shown that CA XII is highly inhibited by all the antiglau‑ coma sulphonamides used clinically 15 ( TABLE 1 ) , and this is probably the membrane‑bound isoform involved in glaucoma that is targeted by these agents . Further work is warranted to better understand the involvement of various CA isoforms in eye pathologies such as glaucoma , retinopathy and macular degeneration . CAIs as potential anti - obesity drugs Among the α ‑CA isoforms found in animals , two CA isozymes , VA and VB , are present in mitochondria ( TABLE 2 ) . These isozymes are involved in several biosyn‑ thetic processes , such as ureagenesis , gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis , in vertebrates ( for example , rodents ) and in invertebrates ( for example , the locust ) 58 . The pro‑ vision of enough of the substrate , bicarbonate , in several biosynthetic processes involving pyruvate carboxylase ( PC ) , acetyl‑CoA carboxylase ( ACC ) and carbamoyl phosphate synthetases I and II , is assured mainly by the catalytic reaction involving the mitochondrial isozymes CA VA and VB — probably assisted by the high activity cytosolic isozyme CA II 58 ( FIG . 3 ) . Several studies have provided evidence that CAIs have potential as anti‑obesity drugs , which might be due to their effects on CA isozymes . Topiramate ( compound 9 ) is an anti‑epileptic drug possessing potent anticonvulsant effects due to a multifactorial mechanism of action : block‑ ade of sodium channels and kainate / AMPA ( α ‑amino‑3‑ hydroxy‑5‑methyl‑4‑isoxazole propionic acid ) receptors , CO 2 retention secondary to inhibition of the red blood cell and brain CA isozymes , as well as enhancement of GABA ( γ ‑aminobutyric acid ) ‑ergic transmission 59 . A side effect of this drug observed in obese patients was the loss of body weight , although no pharmacological explanation of this phenomenon has been provided 60 . Furthermore , topiramate was shown to reduce energy and fat gain in lean ( Fa / ? ) and obese ( fa / fa ) Zucker rats 60 . It was recently demonstrated that topiramate is also a potent inhibitor of several CA isozymes , such as II , VA , VB , VI , VII , XII and XIII ( TABLE 1 ) , and the X‑ray crystal structure of its complex with human CA II has been determined , revealing the molecular interactions that explain the high affinity of this compound for the CA active site 59 . As topiramate also acts as an efficient inhib‑ itor of the human mitochondrial isozymes CA VA and VB , this inhibition of both mitochondrial and cytosolic CA isozymes involved in lipogenesis may provide a new approach to control weight loss 58 – 60 . Zonisamide ( compound 10 ) is another anti‑epileptic drug used as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures 1 , 61 , 62 . It has multiple mechanisms of action , and exhibits a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity . Similar to topiramate , recent clinical studies have dem‑ onstrated additional potential for therapeutic use for neuropathic pain , bipolar disorder , migraine , obesity , eating disorders and Parkinson’s disease 1 . Zonisamide is an aliphatic sulphonamide , which also potently inhibits cytosolic and mitochondrial CAs involved in lipogenesis 61 Figure 3 | Fatty - acid biosynthesis and the role of carbonic anhydrase isozymes . Mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase ( PC ) is needed for the efflux of acetyl groups from the mitochondria to the cytosol where fatty - acid biosynthesis takes place 1 , 58 . Pyruvate is carboxylated to oxaloacetate in the presence of bicarbonate under the catalytic influence of the mitochondrial isozymes ( carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) VA and / or CA VB ) . The mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to acetyl - CoA , which reacts with oxaloacetate , leading to the formation of citrate , which is then translocated to the cytoplasm by means of the tricarboxylic acid transporter . As oxaloacetate is unable to cross the mitochondrial membrane , its decarboxylation regenerates pyruvate , which can then be transported into the mitochondria by means of the pyruvate transporter . The acetyl - CoA thus generated in the cytosol is in fact used for de novo lipogenesis , by carboxylation in the presence of acetyl - CoA carboxylase ( ACC ) and bicarbonate , with formation of malonyl - CoA , the conversion between CO 2 and bicarbonate being assisted by CA II . Subsequent steps involving the sequential transfer of acetyl groups lead to longer - chain fatty acids . Therefore , CA isozymes are critical to the entire process of fatty - acid biosynthesis : VA and / or VB within the mitochondria ( to provide enough substrate to PC ) , and CA II within the cytosol ( for providing sufficient substrate to ACC ) .

Furthermore , zonisamide in conjunction with a reduced‑calorie diet ( deficit of 500 kcal per day ) , resulted in an additional mean 5 kg ( 11 pound ) weight loss compared with diet alone in obese female patients 62 . Thus , inhibition of mitochondrial isoforms CA VA and VB , probably in conjunction with that of the ubiquitous cytosolic isoform CA II , may represent targets for novel anti‑obesity drugs that reduce lipogenesis by inhibiting CA 58 . Anticancer CAIs A key feature of many tumours is hypoxia 63 – 68 . The inadequate supply of oxygen is primarily a pathophysio‑ logical consequence of structurally and functionally disturbed microcirculation and deteriorated oxygen diffusion processes 5 , 63 – 68 . Tumour hypoxia appears to be strongly associated with tumour propagation , malig‑ nant progression , and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy 5 , 63 – 68 . Hypoxia regulates the expression of several genes , including a CA isozyme , CA IX , through the hypoxia inducible factor 1 ( HIF1 ) cascade 5 , 63 – 71 . The expression of CA IX is strongly upregulated by hypoxia and is downregulated by the wild‑type von Hippel‑ lindau tumour suppressor protein ( pVHl ) ( FIG . 4 ) . CA IX expression is strongly increased in many types of tumours , such as gliomas / ependymomas 64 , mesothelio‑ mas 64 , papillary / follicular carcinomas 64 , carcinomas of the bladder 72 , uterine cervix 73 , 74 , nasopharyngeal carcinoma 75 , head and neck 76 , breast 70 , 77 , 78 , oesophagus 64 , lungs 79 , brain 64 , vulva 64 , squamous / basal cell carcinomas 64 , and kidney 80 tumours , among others . In some cancer cells , the VHL gene is mutated leading to the strong upregulation of CA IX ( up to 150‑fold ) as a consequence of constitutive HIF activation 5 , 64 , 77 . CA IX belongs to the highly active human α ‑CAs , its catalytic properties for the CO 2 hydration reaction being comparable with those of the highly evolved catalyst CA II 5 , 64 . As for all α ‑CAs , CA IX is suscep‑ tible to inhibition by anions and sulphonamides and sulphamates 1 , 2 , 5 , 14 , 81 – 89 , with the inhibitors coordinating directly to the zinc ion within the active‑site cavity and participating in various other favourable interactions with amino‑acid residues that are situated in the hydro‑ phobic and hydrophilic halves of the active site . Many low nanomolar CA IX inhibitors have been identified in the past several years 1 , 2 , 5 , 14 ( TABLE 1 ) . Among them , some sulphamates 81 , 88 , 89 and sulphonamides 82 – 86 were characterized by X‑ray crystallography and homology modelling . Such studies also evidenced compounds that are membrane impermeable ( and thus specifically inhibit CA IX in vivo ) 90 – 93 or act as dual CA IX – COX2 ( cyclooxygenase 2 ) inhibitors 82 , 93 . Both heterocyclic 94 , 95 , aromatic sulphonamides 96 , 97 as well as aliphatic 98 sulphon‑ amides / sulphamates / sulphamides 99 – 101 possessing low nanomolar inhibitory activity against CA IX have been detected so far . Some sulphonamides incorporating various sugar moieties were also reported 102 , 103 , but up until now the most useful CAIs for understanding the function of this protein in vivo were the fluorescent com‑ pounds of type 17 ( see later in the text ) 84 , 94 , 104 . As described previously , hypoxia , through the HIF cascade , leads to a strong overexpression of CA IX in many tumours . The overall consequence of this is a pH imbalance , with most hypoxic tumours having acidic pH values around 6 , in contrast to normal tissue , which has characteristic pH values around 7 . 4 ( REFS 84 , 85 , 104 ) . Constitutive expression of human CA IX was recently shown to decrease extracellular pH ( pH e ) in Madin‑Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells 84 . CA IX‑selective sulphonamide inhibitors ( of type 17 and 18 ) reduced the medium acidity by inhibiting the catalytic activity of the enzyme , and thus the generation of H + ions , bind‑ ing specifically only to hypoxic cells expressing CA IX 84 . Deletion of the CA active site was also shown to reduce the acidity of the medium , but a sulphonamide inhibitor did not bind to the active site of such mutant proteins . Therefore , tumour cells decrease their pH e both by Figure 4 | Mechanism of hypoxia - induced gene expression mediated by the HIF transcription factor . At normal oxygen levels ( normoxia ) , prolyl - 4 - hydroxylase ( PHD ) hydroxylates the P564 on hypoxia inducible factor - α ( HIF α ) . The von Hippel - Lindau protein ( VHL ) binds hydroxylated HIF α and targets it for degradation by the ubiquitin – proteasome system . Under hypoxia , HIF α is not hydroxylated , because PHD is inactive in the absence of dioxygen . Non - hydroxylated HIF α is not recognized by the VHL protein , it is stabilized and accumulates . After translocation to the nucleus , HIF α dimerizes with the HIF β constitutive subunit to form an active transcription factor . The HIF transcription factor then binds the hypoxia response element ( HRE ) in target genes and activates their transcription . Target genes include glucose transporters ( GLUT1 and GLUT3 ) that participate in glucose metabolism , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) that triggers neoangiogenesis , erythropoietin ( EPO1 ) involved in erythropoiesis , carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) IX involved in pH regulation and tumorigenesis , and additional genes with functions in cell survival , proliferation , metabolism and other processes 64 – 69 .

CA IX probably also plays a role in providing bicarbonate to be used as a substrate for cell growth , as it is established that bicarbonate is required in the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides 5 , 64 . Indisulam ( compound 10 ) , a sulphonamide deriva‑ tive ( originally called E7070 ) with powerful anticancer activity , was recently shown to act as a nanomolar inhibi‑ tor of CA IX 105 – 108 ( TABLE 1 ) . Its detailed mechanism of action is not clear , but it is known to be involved in the perturbation of the cell cycle in the G1 and / or G2 phases , the downregulation of cyclins , the reduction of cyclin‑ dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2 ) activity , the inhibition of retinoblastoma protein ( prb ) phosphorylation and differential expression of molecules known to participate in cell adhesion , signalling and immune response , in addition to its CA IX inhibitory properties . Indisulam showed in vivo efficacy against human tumour xenografts in nude mice , exhibiting a significant antitumour effect and progressing to Phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumours 105 – 108 . Among the many derivatives reported so far , some of the most interesting potent CA IX inhibitors are the compounds investigated by Svastova et al . 84 ( structures 17 and 18 ) . Derivative 17 is a fluorescent sulphonamide that binds only to CA IX under hypoxic conditions in vivo 84 , 85 , 104 . This compound may therefore be used as a fluorescent probe in hypoxic tumour imaging . Compound 18 belongs to a class of positively charged , membrane‑impermeable compounds . Therefore , as such compounds do not inhibit intracellular CAs , they may exhibit fewer side effects as compared with the presently available compounds ( such as acetazolamide ) , which indiscriminately inhibit all CAs 48 – 50 . The X‑ray crystal structure of compound 18 in adduct with CA II ( the active site of which is similar to that of CA IX ) 6 has been reported recently . The positively charged pyridinium derivative 18 favourably binds within the enzyme active site , coordinating with the deprotonated sulphonamide moiety to the catalytically critical Zn 2 + ion . It also par‑ ticipates in many other favourable interactions with amino‑acid residues present in the active‑site cavity , including stacking between the trimethylpyridinium ring of the inhibitor 18 and the phenyl ring of Phe131 , an amino acid important for the binding of inhibitors to CAs 86 . A similar binding mechanism was subsequently reported for the fluorescein derivative 17 ( REF . 18 ) . Thus , such structures can be used for the rational drug design of more selective and potent isozyme IX inhibitors . As the X‑ray structure of CA IX is not yet available , most studies have used the CA II structure for modelling and designing CA IX inhibitors . In summary , biochemical , physiological and pharmacological data indicate that inhibition of the tumour‑associated CA isozyme IX may be useful in the management of hypoxic tumours that do not respond to classical chemotherapy or radiotherapy 5 , 64 , 84 , 104 . Therefore , the use of the CAIs described above provide possibilities of developing both diagnostic tools for the non‑invasive imaging of these tumours , as well as thera‑ peutic agents that probably perturb the extratumoral acidification in which CA IX is involved 5 , 64 , 84 , 104 . Many types of highly effective in vitro CA IX inhibitors have been developed and evaluated in vitro 80 – 104 . However , although a large number of derivatives with enhanced affinity for the tumour‑associated isozyme IX over the ubiquitously expressed CA I and II isozymes have been discovered 94 , further studies are warranted in order to understand the behaviour of such compounds in vivo , in cell cultures or animal models of the disease . CAIs as potential drugs for osteoporosis The highly active CA II is abundant in the bone , and is present only in osteoclasts at concentrations of the same order of magnitude as those present in the kidneys 109 . Its role there is to provide hydrogen ions , formed from the hydration of CO 2 , to an ATP‑dependent proton pump , which uses them in the mobilization of calcium from the bone . These activities are required for inorganic matrix dissolution that precedes the enzymatic removal of organic bone matrix . Figure 5 | Proteins and processes involved in pH regulation within the tumour cell . CO 2 hydration to bicarbonate and protons is catalysed in these cells by the transmembrane isozymes possessing an extracellular active site , carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) IX and / or CA XII . Other involved proteins include monocarboxylate carrier ( a ) ; Na + – H + antiporter ( b ) ; ATP - dependent Na + – K + antiporter ( c ) ; H + channels ( d ) ; plasma - membrane proton pump H + – ATPase ( e ) ; acquaporins ( f ) ; and anion exchangers ( AE1 - AE3 isoforms ) ( g ) 5 , 64 – 69 . R E V I E W S 176 | FEBruAry 2008 | VOluME 7 www . nature . com / reviews / drugdisc © 200 8 Nature Publishing Group Transport metabolons Carbonic anhydrase isozymes that interact with anion exchanger proteins to form transport metabolons that regulate intracellular and / or extracellular pH . To evaluate the physiological role of membrane‑bound CAs in osteoclasts , a novel membrane‑impermeable CA inhibitor structurally related to compound 18 was used . Increased osteoclast number and bone resorption activity was observed in rat osteoclast cultures exposed to a low concentration of inhibitor , whereas higher con‑ centrations affected cell survival 109 . Inhibitor treatment also disturbed intracellular acidification in osteoclasts . Membrane‑bound isoenzymes CA IV and CA XIV are expressed in osteoclasts in vivo and in vitro . In addition , the inhibitor experiments provide novel evidence to sup‑ port the hypothesis that intracellular pH regulation in osteoclasts may involve transport metabolons and that a possible use of such inhibitors would be in the design of novel anti‑osteoporosis therapies 109 . Non - vertebrate CAs and their inhibition Sequencing of eukaryotic / prokaryotic genomes , in par‑ ticular of pathogens causing widespread diseases ( for example , malaria , tuberculosis , as well as other bacterial and fungal infections ) , has revealed that CAs are also present in these organisms 1 – 4 . However , although verte‑ brates possess only CAs belonging to the α ‑class 9 – 16 , such ‘simpler’ organisms have enzymes belonging to several CA families , for example the α ‑ and β ‑CAs , β ‑ and γ ‑CAs , γ ‑ and δ ‑CAs , or even representatives from three such gene families ( α – γ ‑CAs ) 27 – 34 , 110 – 112 . recently , representatives of the α ‑ or β ‑CA class have been cloned and characterized in several pathogens , such as the protozoan P . falciparum 26 , the bacteria H . pylori 27 , 28 and M . tuberculosis 29 , and the fungi C . albicans 30 and C . neoformans 31 , 32 . As it has been proved that these CAs are critical for the growth or virulence of these patho‑ gens , their capacity to be inhibited has also been investi‑ gated ( TABLE 3 ) . As many such organisms are highly pathogenic , and present different degrees of resistance to the currently available drugs targeting them , inhibition of their CAs may constitute novel approaches to fighting these diseases 26 – 34 , 110 – 112 . P . falciparum is responsible for the majority of life‑ threatening cases of human malaria . The global emer‑ gence of drug‑resistant malarial parasites necessitates the identification and characterization of novel drug targets . The CAs present in P . falciparum belongs to the α ‑CA class ( pfCA ) and possess catalytic properties that are distinct to that of the human host enzymes CA I and II . 4‑ ( 3 , 4‑Dichlorophenylureido‑ethyl ) ‑benzene‑ sulphonamide was the most effective antimalarial sulphonamide CAI against growth of P . falciparum in vitro , with a K I in the nanomolar range ( 80 nM ) and EC 50 ( ex vivo ) in the low micromolar range ( 20 µ M ) . Thus , sulphonamide CAIs targeting the protozoan enzyme may have the potential for the development of novel antimalarial drugs 26 . H . pylori α ‑class CA ( hp α CA ) has been cloned and sequenced from patients with different gastric mucosal lesions , including gastritis , ulcer and cancer 27 , 28 . Some potent hp α CA inhibitors were detected ( K I s of 12 – 84 nM ) , among which were acetazolamide , 4‑amino‑6‑chloro‑ 1 , 3‑benzenedisulphonamide and some newly designed compounds incorporating lipophilic tails . As hp α CA is essential for the survival of the pathogen in acid , its inhibition might be used as a new pharmaco‑ logical tool in the management of drug‑resistant H . pylori infection 27 . DnA clones for the β ‑class CA of H . pylori ( hp β CA ) were isolated from independent strains obtained from patients with various gastric mucosal lesions , including patients with gastritis , gas‑ tric ulcer and gastric cancer 28 . hp β CA was also highly inhibited ( K I s in the range of 24 – 45 nM ) by many sul‑ phonamides / sulphamates , including the clinically used drugs acetazolamide , ethoxzolamide , topiramate and sulpiride . The dual inhibition of α ‑ and / or β ‑class CAs of H . pylori could therefore be a useful alternative for the management of gastritis / gastric ulcers , as well as gastric cancer . This was also the first study showing that a bacterial β ‑CA can be a druggable target 28 . The crucial role played by these two CAs present in H . pylori in acid acclimatization of the pathogen within the stomach is shown schematically in FIG . 6 , and this also helps to understand why inhibition of the two enzymes leads to the death of the bacteria and a possible eradication of H . pylori from the stomach 27 , 28 . The M . tuberculosis rv3588c gene , which has been shown to be required for in vivo growth of the pathogen , was discovered to encode a β ‑CA with activity that is highly dependent on pH , being active at pH 8 . 4 but not at pH 7 . 5 ( REF . 29 ) . This β ‑CA was observed to be a dimeric protein with a blocked active site , being able to switch between two states with an opened or closed active site .

This could lead to a completely new class of antituberculosis drugs , a disease for which resistance to the presently available drugs is a worldwide problem 29 . The nCE103 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also encodes a CA 34 . The main physiological role of CA during growth of S . cerevisiae in glucose‑ammonium salts media is the provision of inorganic carbon for the bicarbonate‑dependent carboxylation reactions catalysed by PC , ACC and CPSase ( carbamoyl‑phosphate syn‑ thetase ) 30 – 32 . However , the most interesting findings in this field regard the signalling role of CAs that is important for the virulence of fungal pathogens such as C . albicans and C . neoformans , as identified by Muhlschlegel’s and Heitman’s groups 30 – 32 . It has been demonstrated that physiological concentrations of CO 2 / HCO 3 – induce fila‑ mentation in C . albicans by a direct stimulation of the adenylyl cyclase activity , as shown schematically in FIG . 7 . Furthermore , it has been shown that CO 2 / HCO 3 – equili‑ bration by the β ‑CAs present in the organism is essential for the pathogenesis of C . albicans in niches where the available CO 2 is limited . Muhlschlegel’s group also dem‑ onstrated that adenylyl cyclase from C . neoformans is sensitive to physiological concentrations of CO 2 / HCO 3 – . Thus , the link between cyclic AMP signalling and CO 2 / HCO 3 – sensing is conserved in fungi , with CO 2 sensing being an important mediator of fungal pathogenesis . Although no inhibitors of these new β ‑CAs have yet been tested , novel therapeutic agents targeting this pathway at several levels could act as new antifungals 30 – 32 . CA activators in drug design Although CAIs have been extensively studied , and exploited clinically for the prevention and treatment of several diseases , the field of CA activators ( CAAs ) is largely unexplored . However , in the past decade , by means of electronic spectroscopy , X‑ray crystallography and kinetic measurements , activators have been shown to bind within the CA active cavity , at a site distinct to that of the inhibitor or substrate‑binding sites , to facilitate the proton‑transfer step of the catalytic cycle . recently , activation of some members of the α ‑CA family ( human CA I and CA II ) was shown to constitute a possible therapeutic approach for the enhancement of synaptic efficacy , which may represent a conceptually new treatment for Alzheimer’s disease , ageing and other conditions in which the achievement of spatial learn‑ ing and memory therapy is necessary 40 , 113 . Sun and Alkon reported that phenylalanine , an activator first investigated by our group to target isozymes I and II 114 , when administered to experimental animals produces a relevant pharmacological enhancement of synaptic efficacy , spatial learning and memory , proving that this class of unexplored enzyme modulators may be used for the management of conditions in which learning and memory are impaired 40 . A multitude of physiologically relevant compounds such as biogenic amines ( histamine , serotonin , catecholamines ) , amino acids , oligopeptides or small proteins , among others , act as efficient CAAs for many of the human CA isozymes 35 – 41 , 115 – 121 . Several X‑ray crystallographic structures of adducts of the main human isoforms , CA I and II , with activators were reported recently , in addition to that of histamine , reported in 1997 ( REFS 35 – 41 ) . The X‑ray crystal struc‑ tures of the human CA II – l‑His / d‑His adducts and the CA II – l‑Phe / d‑Phe adducts showed the activators to be anchored at the entrance of the active site , participating in extended networks of hydrogen bonds and hydro‑ phobic interactions with specific amino‑acid residues or water molecules present in the cavity , thus explaining their different potency and interaction patterns with vari‑ ous isozymes 35 – 39 , 41 . Many drug design studies of CAAs have also been reported , and histamine or carnosine as lead molecules has been considered 114 – 121 . CAAs may lead to the design of pharmacologically useful derivatives for the enhancement of synaptic effi‑ cacy , which may represent a conceptually new approach for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease , ageing and other conditions in which spatial learning and memory therapy need to be enhanced . Conclusions In the field of CA research , the past few years have been highly dynamic and productive . The presumed last mam‑ malian α ‑CA isoform ( CA XV ) has now been isolated , characterized and purified ; along with representatives of the α ‑ , β ‑ , γ ‑ and δ ‑classes from various pathogenic organisms from across the phylogenetic tree . Many of these new CAs are druggable targets , and therefore pro‑ vide potential for the development of pharmacological Figure 6 | A model for the role of urease and α - and β - CA in the maintenance of periplasmic pH in Helicobacter pylori . Under acidic conditions , urea moves into the cytoplasm through the urea channel . In the cytoplasm , 2NH 3 and CO 2 are produced from urea owing to the activity of urease . CO 2 in the periplasm and cytoplasm is hydrated by H . pylori α - and β - carbonic anhydrases ( CAs ) , respectively , resulting in production of H + and bicarbonate . The proton is then consumed by NH 3 to form NH 4 + in the periplasm and cytoplasm , respectively 27 , 28 .

Indeed , resist‑ ance to currently available drugs constitutes a serious medical problem for infections caused by P . falciparum , H . pylori , M . tuberculosis and C . albicans , and CAIs tar‑ geting enzymes from these pathogens may overcome this owing to their novel mechanism of action . Over the past few years , the inhibitory profile of most of the important classes of CAIs — the sulphonamides , sulphamates and sulphamides — against the catalytically active isozymes have been investigated in detail . This is valuable in the search for isozyme‑selective compounds and for reducing side effects of the presently available drugs . However , few compounds have been identified that exhibit selectivity for any CA isoform with clinical relevance , although important advances have been reported in the design of compounds with high selectivity for CA VA , IX and XIII over CA II ( CA II is the ubiquitous , catalytically highly effective isoform , and so its inhibition is often regarded as detrimental ) . Significant advances have been reported in the design of fluorescently labelled and membrane‑impermeable compounds inhibiting only the membrane‑associated CA isoforms ( such as CA IX ) and not those present in the cytosol ( such as CA I and II ) . The use of fluores‑ cent CAIs has indicated the important role of CA IX in tumour acidification processes , and the possibility of reversing this phenomenon by inhibiting the catalytic activity of the enzyme with a CA IX‑selective and potent inhibitor . Various ophthalmologic and anti‑obesity applications of the CAIs have also been reported , together with novel derivatives that act as anticonvulsants . The reported X‑ray crystal structures of many human CA II and I adducts with sulphonamides and sulphamates has pro‑ vided a better understanding of the molecular interac‑ tions between the inhibitor and the enzyme , which may lead to a rational drug design of inhibitors with reduced side effects and selectivity for the target isoform . Finally , important progress has been achieved in the field of the CAAs , with a large number of X‑ray crystallo‑ graphic structures of adducts of isozymes I and II with amino‑acid activators reported . Interesting differences in the binding of enantiomeric activators such as l‑ / d‑Phe and l‑ / d‑His to human CA II have been observed ; and the first X‑ray crystal structure of an adduct of human CA I with an activator ( l‑His ) has recently been reported , showing great differences between the bind‑ ing of activators within the active site of the two main isoforms , CA I and II . For the first time , isoforms other than CA I and II , such as CA IV , VA , VII , XIII and XIV have been investigated for their interaction with a large number of amine and amino‑acid activators . Owing to positive effects on spatial learning and memory , CAAs may provide a novel mechanism for treating disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease .
