The early ESCRTs ( ESCRT - 0 and - I ) are likely involved in cargo sorting , whereas ESCRT - III and Vps4 function to sever the neck of the forming ILVs . ESCRT - II links these functions by initiating ESCRT - III formation in an ESCRT - I – regulated manner . We identify a constitutively active mutant of ESCRT - II that partially sup - presses the phenotype of an ESCRT - I or ESCRT - 0 deletion strain , suggesting that these early ESCRTs are not essential and have redundant functions . However , the ESCRT - III / Vps4 system alone is not sufficient for ILV formation but requires cargo sorting mediated by one of the early ESCRTs . INTRODUCTION The multivesicular body ( MVB ) pathway is the major route for pro - teins destined for the lumen of the vacuole / lysosome . This pathway is conserved from yeast to human cells , where it functions in trans - membrane protein degradation and trafficking of resident hydro - lases to the vacuolar lumen ( reviewed in Katzmann et al . , 2002 ) . MVBs are endosomes that internalize part of their limiting mem - brane as intralumenal vesicles ( ILVs ) along with transmembrane pro - teins destined for the vacuolar lumen . MVBs fuse with the vacuole and release their contents into the hydrolytic lumen of the vacuole . The formation of ILVs is catalyzed by the endosomal sorting com - plexes required for transport ( ESCRTs ) . For most of the known ILV cargo proteins , ubiquitination serves as a sorting signal that is rec - ognized by the ESCRT complexes . The ESCRT machinery is composed of five multimeric com - plexes : ESCRT - 0 , ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , ESCRT - III , and the Vps4 com - plex ( reviewed in Henne et al . , 2011 ) . These soluble complexes are recruited from the cytosol to the MVB , where they function in cargo sorting and ILV formation . “Early - acting” ESCRT complexes ( ESCRT - 0 and ESCRT - I ) possess numerous ubiquitin - binding domains and are therefore proposed to concentrate ubiquitinated cargo on the en - dosomal membrane ( Bilodeau et al . , 2002 , 2003 ; Pornillos et al . , 2002 ; Shih et al . , 2002 ; Mizuno et al . , 2003 ; Shields et al . , 2009 ; Ren and Hurley , 2010 ) . The later - acting ESCRT - III proteins form helical and circular filaments that can deform membrane both in vivo and in vitro ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ; Bodon et al . , 2011 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) . The Vps4 complex then disassembles ESCRT - III , an ATP - dependent activity that seems to drive ILV abscission ( Babst et al . , 1998 , 2002a , b ; Adell et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore these “late - acting” ESCRTs are implicated in the formation of ILVs . ESCRT - II links the cargo sort - ing activity of the early - acting ESCRTs to ILV formation mediated by the late - acting ESCRTs . However , mechanistic insights are lacking as to how ESCRT - II executes this process . ESCRT - II is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of one copy of Vps36 and Vps22 and two copies of Vps25 ( Hierro et al . , 2004 ; Teo et al . , 2004 ) . The N - terminal GRAM - like ubiquitin - binding in Eap45 ( GLUE ) domain ( Slagsvold et al . , 2005 ) of Vps36 interacts with ubiquitin ( either on cargo proteins or other ubiquitinated ESCRT proteins ; Meyer et al . , 2002 ; Alam et al . , 2004 ) , with the endosomal lipid phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ; Slagsvold et al . , 2005 ; Monitoring Editor Benjamin S .

Volume 26 February 1 , 2015 Active ESCRT - II bypasses early ESCRTs | 555 that the GFP - tagged version of Vps36 used in localization studies ( VPS36 - V5 - GFP , where V5 acts as a linker ) is functional and is able to complement the lack of genomic VPS36 . ESCRT - II localization to endosomes was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the accumulated endosomes ( class E compartments ) found in ∼ 500 cells . Western blot analysis indicated that the different mutant forms of vps36 - V5 - GFP were expressed at levels similar to that of the wild - type fusion protein ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) . We first tested the contribution of the PI3P - binding domain to the recruitment of ESCRT - II by constructing the double mutant vps36 ( R89A , R261A ) - V5 - GFP , which , based on data from a previous report , was predicted to abolish PI3P binding ( Teo et al . , 2006 ) . Surprisingly , this mutant form of ESCRT - II was as efficiently re - cruited to endosomes as the wild - type complex ( unpublished data ) . Therefore a triple mutant was constructed ( K38E , R89A , R261E ) that replaced two key positively charged amino acids of the PI3P - binding pocket with glutamate ( referred to as ∆ PI3P ) . As observed for the double mutant , cells expressing vps36 ( ∆ PI3P ) - V5 - GFP showed wild - type like localization of ESCRT - II to endosomes ( Figure 1B ) . Together these data suggested that the PI3P interac - tion does not significantly contribute to the endosomal recruit - ment of ESCRT - II . Consistent with the localization data , we found that both vps36 ( R89A , R261A ) - V5 and vps36 ( ∆ PI3P ) - V5 complemented the MVB - sorting defect of a VPS36 - deletion strain . Both Vps36 mutants were able to function in the efficient delivery of GFP - Cps1 , a cargo of the MVB pathway ( Odorizzi et al . , 1998 ) , to the vacuolar lumen ( Figure 1C ) . Furthermore , both PI3P - binding mutants comple - mented the growth defect of a VPS36 - deletion strain on canava - nine - containing plates ( Figure 1D ) . Canavanine , a toxic arginine analogue , is imported by yeast via the transporter Can1 . Because Can1 is regulated in part by degradation via the MVB pathway , ESCRT mutants stabilize Can1 and thus show increased canavanine sensitivity compared with wild - type cells ( Teis et al . , 2010 ) . Together our data indicate that interaction of Vps36 and PI3P plays a minor role in the localization and activity of ESCRT - II . At this point , we are not able to reconcile why our results contradict previously published data ( Teo et al . , 2006 ) . Next we analyzed the importance of the ubiquitin - binding site of Vps36 by introducing the mutations T187G and F188A ( a double mutant we refer to as ∆ Ub ; Figure 1A ) . These mutations were previ - ously shown to block binding of the Vps36 GLUE domain to ubiq - uitin ( Shields et al . , 2009 ) . Localization studies of strains expressing vps36 ( ∆ Ub ) - V5 - GFP indicated that loss of ubiquitin binding caused a ∼ 50 % drop of ESCRT - II association with the endosomal membrane ( in vps20 ∆ vps36 ∆ in the presence of vps4 ( E233Q ) ; Figure 1B ) . How - ever , this recruitment defect did not result in a MVB - sorting pheno - type . Both the vacuolar delivery of GFP - Cps1 and growth on cana - vanine were found to be wild type – like in cells expressing vps36 ( ∆ Ub ) - V5 ( Figure 1 , C and D ) . This result was consistent with previously published data ( Shields et al . , 2009 ) . The combination of the ubiquitin - binding mutations along with the PI3P - binding mutations ( vps36 ( ∆ PI3P ∆ Ub ) - V5 - GFP ) resulted in no additional ESCRT - II recruiting defect compared with the ubiq - uitin - binding mutation alone ( Figure 1B ) . However , cells expressing vps36 ( ∆ PI3P ∆ Ub ) - V5 exhibited partial missorting of GFP - Cps1 to the vacuolar membrane and marginally increased canavanine sensi - tivity ( Figure 1 , C and D ) , suggesting a possible regulatory role for ubiquitin and PI3P binding independent of their function in ESCRT - II recruitment . In addition , the lack of any observable GFP - Cps1 sort - ing defect with either ∆ Ub or ∆ PI3P alone suggests redundant func - tions for ubiquitin and PI3P binding . Teo et al . , 2006 ) , and with the Vps28 C - terminus of ESCRT - I ( Teo et al . , 2006 ; Gill et al . , 2007 ) . These interactions are predicted to play an important role in the recruitment of ESCRT - II to the MVB . Furthermore , an ESCRT - I – ESCRT - II supercomplex has been de - scribed that is proposed to function in the membrane deformation process leading to the formation of ILVs ( Wollert and Hurley , 2010 ; Boura et al . , 2012 ) . Finally , the Vps25 subunits of ESCRT - II bind to Vps20 , a myristoylated subunit of ESCRT - III ( Ashrafi et al . , 1998 ; Teo et al . , 2004 ) . This interaction between ESCRT - II and Vps20 is be - lieved to initiate the assembly of the ESCRT - III filament ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) . In this study , we report that ESCRT - II is regulated not only by re - cruitment to the MVB but also by an ESCRT - I – mediated activation step . However , this regulatory function of ESCRT - I is not essential for the MVB pathway and can be partially bypassed by a constitutively active ESCRT - II mutant . Furthermore , we show that assembly of ES - CRT - III , which is considered the core ESCRT machinery , is not suffi - cient for efficient ILV formation and that cargo concentration may be essential for this process . RESULTS Regulation of ESCRT - II by membrane recruitment The early ESCRTs ( ESCRT - 0 and - I ) contain numerous ubiquitin - bind - ing domains and are thus likely to be involved in cargo sorting ( re - viewed in Henne et al . , 2011 ) . ESCRT - III and Vps4 have been pro - posed to function in membrane fission , severing the neck of the forming MVB vesicles . ESCRT - II links these early and late functions of the ESCRT machinery by initiating ESCRT - III formation in an ES - CRT - I – dependent manner . This interaction between ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II seems to be regulatory , since the MVB sorting defect ob - served in an ESCRT - I – deletion strain can be partially bypassed by overexpressing ESCRT - II ( Babst et al . , 2002b ) . ESCRT - I binds to ES - CRT - II via the Vps36 GLUE domain , a domain that also interacts with PI3P and ubiquitin ( Figure 1A ; Meyer et al . , 2002 ; Alam et al . , 2004 ; Slagsvold et al . , 2005 ; Teo et al . , 2006 ; Gill et al . , 2007 ) . These three GLUE domain interactions might regulate ESCRT - II function by aid - ing the recruitment of ESCRT - II from the cytoplasm to the MVB . Al - ternatively , the GLUE domain interactions might trigger a conforma - tional change in ESCRT - II that switches ESCRT - II from an inactive to an active state . To differentiate between these two models , we first determined which of the GLUE domain interactions are important for endosomal recruitment of ESCRT - II by mutating the different in - teraction sites . Previous studies suggested that endosomal localization of ES - CRT - II is dependent on the GLUE – PI3P interaction ( Teo et al . , 2006 ) or the combination of both PI3P binding and the interaction of a positive - charged helix of Vps22 with negative - charged phospholip - ids ( Im and Hurley , 2008 ) . Furthermore , a study showed that dele - tion of ESCRT - I did not impair MVB recruitment of ESCRT - II ( Babst et al . , 2002b ) . These localization studies were performed either with just the GLUE domain or in absence of functional Vps4 , an ATPase that recycles ESCRTs back to the cytoplasm . Lack of Vps4 results in accumulation of ESCRT - II – ESCRT - III complexes that are thoroughly anchored on the endosomal membrane ( Babst et al . , 2002b ) . Be - cause of this trapping effect , even strong defects in ESCRT - II recruit - ment to the endosome would not be detectable . To circumvent these problems , we performed the localization studies using a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – tagged version of full - length Vps36 in a strain that lacked both the ESCRT - III subunit Vps20 ( to prevent an - choring by ESCRT - III ) and a functional Vps4 ( expressing dominant - negative vps4 ( E233Q ) to accumulate endosomal membranes ) in addition to lacking genomic VPS36 .

Volume 26 February 1 , 2015 Active ESCRT - II bypasses early ESCRTs | 557 trafficking data and supported the notion that in contrast to ESCRT - II , ESCRT - I is not essential for ILV formation . Identification of a bypass suppressor of vps23 ∆ To study further the potential regulatory role of ESCRT - I on ESCRT - II function , we performed a genetic screen to identify an ESCRT - II mu - tant that suppresses the MVB - sorting defect caused by loss of ES - CRT - I . We randomly mutagenized plasmid - encoded VPS36 and ex - pressed these mutants in a strain deleted for VPS36 and VPS23 . The resulting strains were grown in the presence of canavanine at a con - centration that is lethal for vps23 ∆ . This screen identified vps36 ( F492S ) ( Phe at 492 to Ser , referred to as vps36 ( S ) ; Figure 1A ) as a mutant that suppresses the canavanine sensitivity of vps23 ∆ ( Figure 3 , # 4 ) . Using a functional V5 - tagged version of Vps36 , West - ern blot analysis showed that the mutation did not affect the expres - sion levels of the Vps36 protein ( Supplemental Figure S2A ) . The vps36 ( S ) mutant gene was able to complement the pheno - type of a VPS36 deletion strain ( Figures 2 , A , # 8 , and B , # 8 , and 3 , # 9 , and Supplemental Figure S2B ) . Moreover , vps36 ( S ) was found to be dominant . Even in the presence of wild - type VPS36 , the suppres - sor mutant was able to partially rescue canavanine sensitivity of a vps23 ∆ strain ( Supplemental Figure S3 , # 2 ) . Furthermore , compared with vps23 ∆ , TEM analysis of vps23 ∆ vps36 ∆ vps36 ( S ) cells showed improvement of MVB morphology both in ILV number and endo - somal morphology ( fewer class E compartments and more globular endosomes ; Figure 4 , A – C ) . Canavanine sensitivity tests also indi - cated that vps36 ( S ) suppressed not only the phenotype of vps23 ∆ but also the loss of any of the other ESCRT - I subunits ( Supplemental Figure S3 , # 3 – 8 ) . Furthermore , vps36 ( S ) suppressed the MVB - sort - ing phenotype of a strain deleted for the ESCRT - 0 subunit Vps27 ( Figures 2 , A , # 5 and 6 , and B , # 5 and 6 , and 3 , # 6 and 7 ) . However , the suppression of vps27 ∆ by vps36 ( S ) was greatly impaired in the absence of the ESCRT - I subunit VPS23 ( Figures 2 , A , # 12 , and B , # 12 , and 4 , A – C ) , suggesting that at least one of the early ESCRTs has to be present for a functioning MVB pathway and that the func - tions of ESCRT - 0 and ESCRT - I seemed to be redundant . Of impor - tance , canavanine sensitivity caused by mutations in ESCRT - II or ESCRT - III subunits were not suppressed by vps36 ( S ) ( except vps36 ∆ ; Supplemental Figure S3 , # 9 – 16 ) . Furthermore , GFP - Cps1 sorting with vps36 ( S ) was severely defective in the absence of VPS4 ( Figure 2B , # 13 ) . Together the phenotypic analyses indicated that the vps36 ( S ) - mutant form of ESCRT - II partially bypassed the need for the early ESCRTs ( ESCRT - 0 or ESCRT - I ) but remained dependent on the function of the late ESCRTs . However , this suppression of the ESCRT - I – mutant phenotype was not due to improved endosomal recruitment of ESCRT - II in this strain . Localization studies in vps23 ∆ vps20 ∆ vps36 ∆ vps4 ( E233Q ) cells expressing vps36 ( S ) - V5 - GFP as the only copy of VPS36 indicated that the bypass mutation did not improve the amount of endosome - associated ESCRT - II over the wild - type copy ( Figure 1B ) . This result suggested that ESCRT - II function was regulated not only by endosomal recruitment but also by a mechanism that switched membrane - associated ESCRT - II from an inactive to an active form . In the case of wild - type ESCRT - II , this activation might be triggered by the interactions of the Vps36 GLUE domain with ESCRT - I , PI3P , and ubiquitin . In contrast , the vps36 ( S ) - mutant form of ESCRT - II seemed to be constitutively active and is therefore independent of the upstream factors for activation . vps36 ( S ) causes ESCRT - I – independent ESCRT - III assembly The observation that vps36 ( S ) suppressed the trafficking and morphology defects of vps23 ∆ suggests that this mutant form of To analyze the importance of ESCRT - I , we deleted VPS23 , the gene encoding the major subunit of the ESCRT - I protein complex . In the strain vps23 ∆ vps20 ∆ vps36 ∆ vps4 ( E233Q ) , GFP - tagged WT copy of ESCRT - II localized mainly to the cytoplasm , and endosomal re - cruitment was < 10 % compared to the recruitment in cells with func - tional ESCRT - I ( Figure 1B ) . This result suggested that ESCRT - I pro - vides a significant recruitment signal for ESCRT - II , most likely through direct interaction of the Vps28 C - terminus ( ESCRT - I ) with the Vps36 GLUE domain ( ESCRT - II ) . In summary , the analysis of the Vps36 GLUE - domain mutants in - dicated that the interaction between ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II plays a key role in the endosomal recruitment of ESCRT - II . Binding of the GLUE domain to ubiquitin further contributes to recruitment effi - ciency . In contrast , the interaction of the GLUE domain with PI3P seems to be less relevant for ESCRT - II localization or function . ESCRT - I is not essential for ILV formation The data presented so far suggested that the ESCRT - I interaction is important for localization of ESCRT - II . However , the observed sup - pression of the ESCRT - I phenotype by overexpression of ESCRT - II suggested that ESCRT - I is not an essential component of the ESCRT machinery ( Babst et al . , 2002b ) . To further test this idea , we carefully analyzed the functionality of the MVB pathway in strains deleted for VPS23 ( loss of ESCRT - I ) or VPS36 ( loss of ESCRT - II ) . Using fluores - cence microscopy , we confirmed the previously published results that both deletions cause severe missorting of GFP - Cps1 to the vacuolar membrane ( Babst et al . , 2002b ; Alam et al . , 2004 ; Figure 2A ) . To better quantify the sorting defects , we analyzed GFP - Cps1 sorting by Western blot using anti - GFP antibodies . When GFP - Cps1 enters the vacuolar lumen , the resident hydrolases clip the protein and release free GFP , resulting in a 25 - kDa band ( band b in Figure 2B ) . In contrast , the proteolytic clipping of GFP - Cps1 , which mislo - calizes to the vacuolar membrane and class E endosomes , causes the appearance of bands in the 30 - kDa range ( GFP fused to the transmembrane domain of Cps1 ; bands labeled a in Figure 2B ) . The ratio of the free GFP signal to the total GFP signal from proteolytic processing indicates the extent of GFP - Cps1 sorting into the MVB pathway ( quantification in Figure 2B ) . This Western blot analysis in - dicated that the MVB - sorting defect in vps36 ∆ is more severe than that observed in the strain lacking VPS23 ( Figure 2 , A , # 2 and 3 , and B , # 2 and 3 ) . An additional analysis of the trafficking phenotype was performed using the canavanine - sensitivity assay . Consistent with the data of the GFP - Cps1 Western blot analysis , we observed slightly higher canavanine sensitivity in vps36 ∆ than with cells lack - ing VPS23 ( Figure 3 , # 2 and 3 ) . Together both assays indicated that the loss of VPS23 is less detrimental for the MVB pathway than the deletion of VPS36 , suggesting that some ILV formation might still occur in vps23 ∆ . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) was used to visualize the late endosomal compartments of the ESCRT - I – and ESCRT - II – deletion strains . The cross - sections of vps36 ∆ cells showed no MVBs but instead the stacked and flattened endosomal structures referred to as class E compartments ( Figure 4 , A and C ; Rieder et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , in cells deleted for VPS23 , we observed a mixture of class E compartments and endosomes containing ILVs ( Figure 4 , A – C ) . However , compared with wild - type MVBs , the number of ILVs in these endosomal cross - sections was dramatically reduced ( from approximately eight in wild type approximately one in vps23 ∆ ; Figure 4B ) . Furthermore , some of these ILV - containing endosomes displayed the flattened morphology of class E compartments ( termed vesicular tubular endosomes [ VTEs ] ; Nickerson et al . , 2006 ) . Together the results from the TEM analysis were consistent with the 558 | S . K . Mageswaran et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell FIGURE 2 : Trafficking of GFP - Cps1 in different ESCRT mutants .

Volume 26 February 1 , 2015 Active ESCRT - II bypasses early ESCRTs | 559 expressing vps36 ( S ) showed greatly impaired Snf7 oligomerization ( Figure 5A , # 7 ) . Of interest , the presence of vps36 ( S ) triggered ES - CRT - III oligomerization even in the absence of both VPS27 and VPS23 ( Figure 5A , # 9 ) , although the same strain was severely defec - tive in MVB vesicle formation ( Figure 4 , A – C ) . This result suggested that ESCRT - III assembly is not sufficient to drive ILV formation . So far the data support the model in which the GLUE domain interactions drive both recruitment and activation of ESCRT - II . One possible mechanism for this regulation would be that the GLUE do - main inhibits ESCRT - II functions unless the GLUE domain is bound to the upstream effectors ESCRT - I , PI3P , and ubiquitinated cargo . This type of autoinhibitory system is found in several ESCRT compo - nents , including ESCRT - III subunits and Vps4 , which ensures that the ESCRTs are only assembling at the proper place and time ( reviewed in Babst et al . , 2011 ; McCullough et al . , 2013 ) . ESCRT - II can function without the GLUE domain To test whether the GLUE domain indeed functions as an autoinhibi - tory system , we deleted this domain of Vps36 ( amino acids 1 – 289 ; Vps36 ( ∆ GLUE ) ; Teo et al . , 2006 ) and analyzed the consequences for localization and function of ESCRT - II . We expected that the GLUE - domain deletion would impair recruitment of ESCRT - II to MVBs . Localization studies of cells expressing Vps36 ( ∆ GLUE ) - V5 - GFP ESCRT - II is able to initiate ESCRT - III formation without the ESCRT - I interaction . We tested this prediction by analyzing the oligomeric state of the most common ESCRT - III subunit , Snf7 , using a glycerol density gradient centrifugation assay ( Figure 5A ) . In these experi - ments , the monomeric Snf7 protein was found in the top three frac - tions of the gradient , whereas the oligomers were identified in frac - tions 4 – 10 ( consistent with previously published data ; Teis et al . , 2008 ) . The ratio of Snf7 oligomers relative to total endosomally bound Snf7 was determined from three independent experiments . Similar to the previously published results , we found that wild - type cells contained 65 % of the total Snf7 as large oligomers , whereas in cells lacking the ESCRT - III disassembly factor Vps4 , close to 100 % of Snf7 accumulated in the oligomeric form ( Figure 5A , # 1 and 2 ) . The vps20 ∆ strain contained no ESCRT - III oligomers , consistent with the model in which Vps20 initiates Snf7 polymerization ( Figure 5A , # 3 ) . In cells deleted for VPS36 , only ∼ 3 % of Snf7 was present in oligomers ( Figure 5A , # 4 ) . Similarly , in cells lacking VPS23 , Snf7 was predomi - nantly monomeric ( only 6 % oligomers ) , indicating a defect in ESCRT - III assembly in this mutant strain ( Figure 5A , # 5 ) . However , the pres - ence of the bypass mutant vps36 ( S ) in vps23 ∆ restored ESCRT - III oligomer assembly to almost wild - type levels ( ∼ 50 % of Snf7 was present as oligomers ; Figure 5A , # 6 ) . Vps20 was required for this suppression of ESCRT - III formation , as a vps23 ∆ vps20 ∆ vps36 ∆ strain FIGURE 3 : Growth assay in the presence of canavanine .

The strains additionally lack the genomic copy of VPS36 , and the WT / mutant copy of VPS36 - V5 - GFP is expressed under the native promoter of VPS36 from a CEN plasmid . There was no significant difference in the overall expression of WT / mutant copy of VPS36 - V5 - GFP ( as quantified by microscopy ) . 562 | S . K . Mageswaran et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell acid flexible linker region ( Figure 1A ; Im and Hurley , 2008 ) . Our model predicts that the interaction of the GLUE domain with ESCRT - I is able to affect the binding of the ESCRT - II subunit Vps25 to Vps20 . Therefore the linker region might not be as unstructured as pre - dicted and thus might be able to relay the information regarding the GLUE domain interactions to the rest of the ESCRT - II complex . To test this idea , we deleted either 15 or 25 amino acids from the cen - tral section of the linker region of Vps36 and analyzed these mutant proteins in a complementation assay ( in the absence of genomic VPS36 ) . With ∆ 15 linker deletion , GFP - Cps1 localized mainly to the vacuolar lumen , indicating that this mutation did not impair ESCRT - II function . However , the larger deletion of the linker region ( ∆ 25 ) caused a GFP - Cps1 sorting defect ( Figure 6A ) . These results sug - gested that the linker is not essential to relay GLUE domain interac - tions to the rest of the ESCRT - II complex but possibly provides a flexible connection between the GLUE domain and Vps36 core . The results from the linker deletions suggested that the GLUE domain might directly interact with other domains or subunits of ESCRT - II in order to regulate the interaction with Vps20 . This model is supported by previous studies that indicated a compact structure of the ESCRT - II complex ( in contrast to a longer , flexible connection between GLUE and the ESCRT - II core ; Im and Hurley , 2008 ) . To test whether ESCRT - II activation changes the overall structure of the complex , we compared by gel filtration the size of wild - type and F492S mutant forms of ESCRT - II ( using antibodies against the V5 tag at the C - terminus of Vps36 ) . The results indicated that both protein complexes have the same apparent molecular weight of ∼ 150 kDa , suggesting that activation does not cause a dramatic change in the Stokes radius of ESCRT - II ( Figure 6B ) . Therefore it is likely that the GLUE domain is “tucked in” by binding to the ESCRT - II core in both the inactive and active conformations . However , ESCRT - II ( S ) was found to be more prone to degradation during the sample prepara - tion , causing the formation of truncated , monomeric Vps36 frag - ments ( Figure 6B ) . DISCUSSION ESCRT - 0 and ESCRT - I contain numerous ubiquitin - binding sites . In addition , ESCRT - 0 seems to be able to form higher - ordered oligom - ers on the endosomal membrane ( Mayers et al . , 2011 ) . These prop - erties make these early ESCRTs prime candidates for the role of a cargo - capturing system . ESCRT - III polymers together with Vps4 seem to execute the membrane abscission reaction during both cy - tokinesis and HIV viral budding . Therefore it is likely that ESCRT - III / Vps4 performs the same function at the MVB , constricting and sev - ering the neck of the forming ILV . Besides its role in initiating ESCRT - III assembly , little is known about the function of ESCRT - II in ILV for - mation . Based on structural studies , a model has been proposed in which the ESCRT - I – ESCRT - II supercomplex is involved in deforming the membrane to drive the invagination of the forming ILV ( Wollert and Hurley , 2010 ; Boura et al . , 2012 ) . However , direct evidence for this role of ESCRT - II in membrane bending is lacking . A surprising conclusion from our study is the observation that ESCRT - 0 and ESCRT - I are not essential for the MVB pathway but have redundant roles , most likely in cargo sorting and concentra - tion . Even the GLUE domain of ESCRT - II , which binds to ESCRT - I , ubiquitinated cargo , and the lipid PI3P , is not essential for the MVB pathway . In contrast , the ESCRT - II – mediated initiation of ESCRT - III assembly is critical for this pathway . These observations suggested that the interactions of ESCRT - II with the upstream ESCRT - I com - plex are not essential for vesicle formation ( e . g . , driving membrane invagination ) but play a regulatory role in ensuring ESCRT - III for - mation at the proper time and place . Our data suggest that the # 9 ) and no complementation for canavanine growth defect in the same strain ( Figure 3 , # 12 and 13 ) . However , introducing the sup - pressor mutation F492S into the ESCRT - II ( ∆ GLUE ) overexpression construct resulted in a clear rescue of the vps36 ∆ phenotype ( p2μ [ EII ( ∆ GLUE , S ) ] in Figures 2 , A , # 10 , and B , # 10 , and 3 , # 10 ) . Furthermore , high levels of ESCRT - II ( ∆ GLUE , S ) were able to partially suppress the trafficking phenotypes caused by deletion of VPS23 ( Figures 2 , A , # 11 , and B , # 11 , and 3 , # 15 and 16 ) , as well as the phenotypes of vps27 ∆ ( Figures 2 , A , # 7 , and B , # 7 , and 3 , # 8 ) . Note that the effectiveness of suppression by p2μ [ EII ( ∆ GLUE , S ) ] varied dramatically from cell to cell , which is likely caused by the cell - to - cell variation of copy numbers of 2μ - type plasmids ( Futcher and Cox , 1984 ) . Consistent with the trafficking phenotypes seen in the fore - going , the presence of p2μ [ EII ( ∆ GLUE , S ) ] in a strain lacking VPS23 increased both the oligomerization of ESCRT - III ( Figure 5 , # 8 ) and the formation of ILVs ( approximately three per endosome ; Figure 4 , A and B ) . However , the endosomal morphology defect of vps23 ∆ did not improve by overexpressing ESCRT - II ( ∆ GLUE , S ) ( Figure 4C ) . In summary , the analysis of the GLUE domain – deleted ESCRT - II indicated that , although not essential for function , this domain plays an important role in the localization and activation of the ESCRT - II complex . However , the GLUE domain does not function as a simple inhibitory domain that blocks ESCRT - II activity when not engaged with ESCRT - I . The deletion of the GLUE domain did not result in a constitutively active ESCRT - II . The switch to the constitutively active state still required the suppressor mutation F492S . Therefore the GLUE domain seems to have activation rather than inhibitory functions . Interaction of ESCRT - II with Vps20 might be regulated ESCRT - II interacts with the downstream ESCRT machinery via Vps20 . Like all other ESCRT - III subunits , monomeric Vps20 is believed to exist in an autoinhibited or closed state ( Muzioł et al . , 2006 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ; Lata et al . , 2008 ; Bajorek et al . , 2009 ) . To start the as - sembly of the ESCRT - III polymer , Vps20 has to be switched into an open conformation , a conformational change believed to be caused by binding to ESCRT - II . In one possible scenario , ESCRT - II activation by ESCRT - I triggers a conformational change that allows ESCRT - II to bind to Vps20 , causing Vps20 to switch into the open state . To test this model , we quantified the endosomal localization of wild - type and F492S mutant ESCRT - II in strains lacking the ESCRT - I subunit Vps23 and the ESCRT - III subunit Snf7 . In this double - mutant strain , the endosomal localization of ESCRT - II is independent of the up - stream ESCRTs ( because of VPS23 deletion ) and the downstream ESCRT - III polymer ( because of SNF7 deletion ) . Therefore the local - ization of ESCRT - II to the endosome in vps23 ∆ snf7 ∆ should be sen - sitive to the interaction strength between ESCRT - II and Vps20 . The analysis showed that in the presence of the activating mutation F492S , ESCRT - II localization to endosomes is increased ( Figure 5B ) . This increase in ESCRT - II ( S ) localization was not observed in the ab - sence of Vps20 ( Figure 1B ) , supporting the idea that an increased interaction between ESCRT - II ( S ) and Vps20 might be responsible for the enhanced endosomal recruitment of activated ESCRT - II . This observation is consistent with the model that activation of ESCRT - II increases binding to Vps20 , which then initiates the polymerization of ESCRT - III . However , we cannot exclude the possibility that the increased endosomal recruitment of ESCRT - II ( S ) is due to an un - known factor bridging Vps20 and ESCRT - II . The linker region is not essential for ESCRT - II function Based on comparisons with the human ESCRT - II structure , the yeast Vps36 core is connected to the GLUE domain via an ∼ 30 – amino Volume 26 February 1 , 2015 Active ESCRT - II bypasses early ESCRTs | 563 of this observation is that activation of ESCRT - II increases the interaction strength between the ESCRT - II subunit Vps25 and Vps20 . This increased interaction with Vps25 might cause Vps20 to switch from the inac - tive , closed conformation to the polymer - forming , open conformation ( Muzioł et al . , 2006 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ) . Another interesting observation from this study is that the constitutively active ∆ GLUE version of ESCRT - II ( ESCRT - II ( ∆ GLUE , S ) ) effi - ciently rescued ESCRT - III polymerization in vps23 ∆ strain but showed only a marginal improvement in ILV formation in the same strain ( Table 1 ) . This difference in phenotypic suppression suggested that some of the ESCRT - III polymers formed by ESCRT - II ( ∆ GLUE , S ) were unproductive , most likely because ESCRT - III polymerization was trig - gered at the wrong place and / or time . In ad - dition , this result suggested that ESCRT - III alone is not sufficient to deform the mem - brane and cause vesicle budding . The con - centration of cargo into a cargo – ESCRT patch at the endosome might play an im - portant role in initiating vesicle formation . Consistent with this idea , ESCRT - II ( S ) exhib - ited very poor ILV formation and GFP - Cps1 sorting in a strain lacking both ESCRT - 0 and ESCRT - I despite showing substantial levels of ESCRT - III polymerization ( Table 1 ) . Fur - thermore , a previous study indicated that the presence of ubiquitinated cargo at the endosome is essential for ILV formation ( MacDonald et al . , 2012 ) . Together our data suggest that ESCRT - 0 and ESCRT - I have re - dundant functions and that at least one of these cargo - sorting complexes has to be present to drive ILV formation ( Table 1 ) . In summary , we propose a model in which the assembly of a cargo – ESCRT patch is an essential first step toward ILV formation ( Figure 7B ) . A cargo patch is formed by the regulation of ESCRT - II function is mediated by both the recruit - ment of the complex from the cytoplasm to the MVB and an acti - vation mechanism . The key for both of these regulation mecha - nisms is the interaction between the GLUE domain and ESCRT - I . The binding of the GLUE domain to ubiquitin and PI3P plays only a minor role in ESCRT - II regulation ( Table 1 ) . We identified the amino acid exchange F492S in Vps36 as a mu - tation that seemed to result in a constitutively active form of ESCRT - II ( referred to as ESCRT - II ( S ) ) . The localization of ESCRT - II ( S ) to endo - somes was not increased compared with the wild - type complex , indicating that recruitment and activation of ESCRT - II are indepen - dent processes . ESCRT - II ( S ) was able to suppress the MVB - sorting phenotypes of an ESCRT - 0 or ESCRT - I deletion by triggering ESCRT - III polymer formation in the absence of these upstream factors . ES - CRT - III polymerization is initiated by the interaction between ESCRT - II and Vps20 . Our ESCRT - II localization data indicated increased Vps20 - dependent endosomal recruitment of ESCRT - II ( S ) compared with the wild - type ESCRT - II complex ( Figure 7A ) .

Volume 26 February 1 , 2015 Active ESCRT - II bypasses early ESCRTs | 565 region . F492S mutation was introduced into pMB175 and its deriva - tives by QuikChange protocol using Phusion polymerase enzyme . Similar QuikChange protocol was used to make ubiquitin and PI3P mutants ; linker deletions and V5 - and GFP - tagged VPS36 in cen - tromere ( CEN ) plasmids were derived from pMB131 . V5 tagging of VPS36 in pMB175 was performed by SLIC technique ( using two PCR products for the vector and ESCRT - II sequences , whereas the V5 sequence was reconstituted by annealing two oligonucleotides ) . The GLUE domain deletions in pMB131 , pMB175 and their deriva - tives were similarly made using SLIC technique using two PCR prod - ucts for the vector and ESCRT - II sequences ( without GLUE domain ) . Yeast strains were grown in rich yeast extract / peptone / dextrose ( YPD ) medium or in the appropriate synthetic drop - out media in yeast nitrogen base ( YNB ; Becton , Dickinson and Company , Sparks , MD ) as published ( Sherman et al . , 1979 ) . In every set of experiments , strains were grown in the same growth medium . Fluorescence microscopy and quantification Yeast cells were grown in YNB selective medium ( Anachem Bio101 Systems , Luton , UK , and USBiological , Swampscott , MA ) to logarith - mic growth phase ( 0 . 7 OD 600 ) . Fluorescence microscopy was performed at 100 × magnification on a deconvolution microscope ( DeltaVision ; Applied Precision , Issaquah , WA ) using the accompa - nying software . Images were taken as Z - stacks and deconvolved . For quantification of endosomal localization of Vps36 - V5 - GFP , a projection of the Z - stacks ( 25 stacks , 5 μm total ) of 500 cells was ana - lyzed . The brightest intensity of puncta for each cell was recorded after background subtraction . For cells showing no discernible puncta , the value was recorded as zero . The error bars denote the 95 % confidence interval over the mean for each strain . For staining with FM4 - 64 , cells in logarithmic growth phase were incubated with the dye ( at a final concentration of 1 μg / ml ) at 30°C for 15 min . The cells were washed with fresh growth medium and incubated at 30°C for 30 min . Manders’ colocalization coefficient ( M 1 ) was used to quantify colocalization ( Dunn et al . , 2011 ) . Decon - volved images from Z - stacks containing multiple cells were con - verted into a two - dimensional array of pixel intensities before back - ground subtraction . For background subtraction , local background ( median of a 40 × 40 region around the particular pixel ) for each pixel was calculated . The local background value for each pixel was then subtracted from the respective pixel value . An additional small value was subtracted from each pixel to remove signal from nonspe - cific regions . M 1 was calculated over several images for each strain and presented as mean ± range for 95 % confidence interval . Canavanine plate assay Yeast cells were grown in YNB ( selective media wherever necessary ) to logarithmic growth phase . After removal of the growth medium , cells were resuspended in 1 M sorbitol to final OD 600 of 0 . 5 . Serial dilutions were made for each strain in 96 - well plates , so that the first column had 0 . 5 OD 600 cells and every successive column was five times diluted from the preceding column . For each strain , 3 μl of cells were plated from the foregoing dilutions . Agar plates contain - ing canavanine ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) were made with 2 % glucose and 6 . 7 g / l YNB without arginine . In addition , uracil ( 20 μg / ml ) , leucine ( 30 μg / ml ) , histidine ( 20 μg / ml ) , adenine ( 20 μg / ml ) , lysine ( 30 μg / ml ) , and tryptophan ( 20 μg / ml ) were provided wherever necessary to support the growth of auxotrophic strains . Western blot analysis For quantification of GFP - Cps1 sorting into vacuole and for visual - izing expression of the various tagged - Vps36 , yeast cell extracts interaction of ESCRT - 0 and ESCRT - I with transmembrane proteins ( ubiquitin dependent or independent ) . Because transmembrane proteins surround themselves with specific lipids , the cargo patch is expected to have a unique lipid composition compared with the rest of the endosomal membrane . We propose that this assembly of ESCRTs , cargo , and lipids causes an inward deformation of the cargo patch ( discussed in Babst , 2011 ) . The ESCRT - I component of the cargo patch , together with ubiquitinated cargo and PI3P , recruits ESCRT - II by interacting with the GLUE domain . This interaction also changes the ESCRT - II conformation into the active state , which in turn increases the affinity of ESCRT - II to Vps20 ( Figure 7A ) . ESCRT - II – bound Vps20 changes its conformation from the closed to the open state , which recruits Snf7 and initiates the polymerization of the ESCRT - III complex . Based on previous in vitro studies , the ESCRT - III polymer might form a corral that defines the boundaries of the form - ing vesicle ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . Finally , ESCRT - III , together with the Vps4 complex , drives the constriction of the membrane neck , which ultimately causes the abscission of the forming ILV ( Figure 7B ) . In this model , constitutively active ESCRT - II ( S ) can partially by - pass the loss of ESCRT - I by interacting with the ubiquitinated cargo , which ensures ESCRT - III formation at the proper place . However , deletion of the GLUE domain of ESCRT - II ( S ) results in an ESCRT - II complex that lacks interaction with the cargo patch . As a conse - quence , ESCRT - III polymerization occurs randomly on the endo - somal membrane , and only by chance will ESCRT - III form close to a cargo patch , explaining the inefficiency in ILV formation in this mu - tant strain . Similar decoupling of ESCRT - III polymerization from ILV formation occurs with ESCRT - II ( S ) in a strain lacking both ESCRT - 0 and ESCRT - I complexes ( Figure 7B ) . The data presented here add to the growing evidence that the ESCRT machinery does not cause ILV formation by physically invagi - nating the membrane but instead by stabilizing and constricting the neck of an existing invagination . Membrane constriction is medi - ated by ESCRT - III and Vps4 , the essential part of the ESCRT machin - ery that is common to all ESCRT - mediated processes , including cytokinesis , viral budding , and plasma membrane repair . Therefore the essential ESCRTs are , first and foremost , a membrane - abscission machinery . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , media , and plasmids The strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 2 . Yeast gene knockouts were constructed as previously described ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . Yeast strain KFY7 was constructed in 6210 . 1 WT yeast by replacing VPS36 with URA3 gene and VPS20 with HIS3 gene . SKY1 strain was constructed by introducing URA3 gene into the VPS36 locus of EEY6 - 2 . SKY8 , SKY14 , and SKY15 strains were constructed by further knocking out the genomic copy of VPS20 , VPS27 , or SNF7 with G418 cassette ( KanMX6 ) in SKY1 . Plasmids were constructed using PCR / conventional restriction enzymes , the sequence and ligation - independent cloning ( SLIC ; Li and Elledge , 2007 ) method , or by QuikChange protocol . pSD2 and pSK211 were constructed by inserting the previously described GFP - Cps1 con - struct ( Odorizzi et al . , 1998 ) into pRS415 and pRS414 vectors , re - spectively . Similar vector swap was performed to construct pMB187 from the previously described pMB66 ( Babst et al . , 1998 ) . F492S mutation in VPS36 was isolated from the canavanine screen by using homologous recombination of error - prone PCR product of VPS36 and a gapped plasmid of pMB131 that lacked most of the coding sequence of VPS36 but retained the 5 ′ and 3 ′ untranslated regions . pSK163 was constructed by replacing the promoter region of the mutant VPS36 isolated in the screen with wild - type promoter 566 | S .

Gel filtration analysis Yeast cells were spheroplasted and lysed in PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail ( Complete ; Roche Molecular Biochemicals , India - napolis , IN ) and 200 μg / ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( Sigma - Aldrich Life Science ) . The lysates were centrifuged at 100 , 000 × g to remove cellular debris and aggregates . The resulting supernatants were loaded on a Sephacryl S300 column ( 16 / 60 ; GE Healthcare ) and separated in the presence of PBS . Statistical analyses A Kolmogorov – Smirnov test was performed for endosomal local - ization of ESCRT - II in Figures 1B and 5B and for ILV counts in Figure 4B using the application R ( www . r - project . org ) . Student’s t test ( unequal variance , two - tailed ) was performed for GFP - Cps1 sort - ing in Figure 2B and Snf7 oligomerization assay in Figure 5A . All differences are significant with p < 0 . 05 . p values for the less obvi - ous differences are denoted in the figures as follows : * p < 0 . 05 ; * * p < 0 . 01 ; * * * p < 0 . 001 . were obtained from strains grown to logarithmic phase . Cells were pelleted , resuspended in SDS – PAGE sample buffer ( 2 % SDS , 0 . 1 M Tris , pH 6 . 8 , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 01 % bromophenol blue , 5 % β - mercaptoethanol ) , lysed using glass beads , and boiled for 5 min at 95°C . For Western blotting , monoclonal antibodies against V5 and GFP ( anti - V5 antibody from AbD Serotec [ Kidlington , UK ] and anti - GFP antibody from Roche Diagnostics [ Basel , Switzerland ] ) were used at 1 : 2500 dilutions . The anti - Snf7 antibody used was previ - ously described ( Babst et al . , 1998 ) . IRDye - conjugated secondary antibody were purchased from LI - COR Biosciences ( Lincoln , NE ) , and Western blots were imaged using the accompanying Odyssey Imaging System . Transmission electron microscopy Yeast were grown at 30°C to logarithmic phase , transferred to alu - minum hats , high - pressure frozen , and placed in vials with a freeze substitution solution of 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate and 2 % glutaralde - hyde in anhydrous acetone . Vials were placed in an automatic freeze substitution device ( EM AFS2 ; Leica , Buffalo Grove , IL ) at – 140°C and warmed to – 80°C over 24 h . Cells were extracted from the hats at − 80°C , placed in chilled tubes with fresh freeze substi - tution solution for 48 h , and then warmed to − 60°C over 20 h . Fixa - tive was replaced with Lowicryl HM20 over the next 96 h with three acetone washes , three washes of increasing HM20 : acetone ( 1 : 3 , 1 : 1 , and 3 : 1 ) , and six washes with 100 % HM20 . Polymerization with ultraviolet light began at − 60°C for 12 h and continued up to 20°C over 36 h . The 90 - nm sample thin sections were placed on rho - dium - plated Formvar - coated copper grids and viewed with a Philips ( Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) CM10 transmission electron microscope , and images were processed using ImageJ64 . Glycerol density gradient centrifugation assay This assay was adapted from Teis et al . ( 2008 ) . Before harvesting cells and preparing cell lysates for the assay , we prepared 10 – 40 % linear glycerol gradients in Beckman Ultra - Clear SW - 41 tubes ( 14 × 89 mm ; 344059 ; Beckman Coulter , Brea , CA ) . We prepared 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 % stocks of glycerol in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0 . 5 % Tween 20 and protease inhibitors . Gradients were made in SW - 41 tubes by carefully layering the different glycerol stock solutions in decreasing order of glycerol concentration ( 2 . 5 ml of each of 40 , 30 , 20 , and 10 % glycerol solutions ) , so that 40 % glyc - erol solution was at the bottom of the tube . The 10 % glycerol solu - tion was made in lysis buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 . The result - ing 10 – 40 % step gradients were converted into 10 – 40 % linear gradients by spinning at 30 , 000 rpm for 1 h or until the step inter - faces were no longer visible . To prepare cell extracts for the gradient assay , 30 OD 600 equivalents of logarithmic growth phase cells were harvested , washed , spheroplasted , and Dounced for each experi - ment . Unbroken cells ( P5 fraction ) were removed by spinning them out for 3 min at 3000 rpm . Supernatants were collected and spun for 10 min at 13 , 000 rpm to separate the endosomal fraction ( P13 ) . Proteins in the P13 fraction , which are mostly membrane associated , were solubilized in 1 ml PBS containing 0 . 5 % Tween 20 . Subse - quently , the solubilized P13 fraction was passed five times through a 25G5 / 8 needle and spun again for 10 min at 13 , 000 rpm . The result - ing supernatants were carefully isolated for gradient analysis . Simul - taneously , two different sizing control standards were prepared , one containing aldolase ( 159 kDa ) and ferritin ( 440 kDa ) , and the other containing catalase ( 247 kDa ) and thyroglobulin ( 667 kDa ) , with each protein at 1 . 67 mg / ml final concentration in 1 . 2 ml of lysis buffer ( also containing 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . The stock solutions of sizing stan - dard proteins were prespun at 13 , 000 rpm before use to remove ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Kelsey Fulkerson and Stacey Drosner for help with yeast strain / plasmid construction and Matt Curtiss for helping with the preparation of reagents used in this study .
