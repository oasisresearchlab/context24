McKay 1 The application of human embryonic stem ( ES ) cells in medicine and biology has an inherent reliance on understanding the starting cell population . Human ES cells differ from mouse ES cells and the specific embryonic origin of both cell types is unclear . Previous work suggested that mouse ES cells could only be obtained from the embryo before implantation in the uterus 1 – 5 . Here we show that cell lines can be derived from the epiblast , a tissue of the post - implantation embryo that generates the embryo proper . These cells , which we refer to as EpiSCs ( post - implantation epiblast - derived stem cells ) , express transcription factors known to regu - late pluripotency , maintain their genomic integrity , and robustly differentiate into the major somatic cell types as well as primordial germ cells . The EpiSC lines are distinct from mouse ES cells in their epigenetic state and the signals controlling their differenti - ation . Furthermore , EpiSC and human ES cells share patterns of gene expression and signalling responses that normally function in the epiblast . These results show that epiblast cells can be main - tained as stable cell lines and interrogated to understand how pluripotent cells generate distinct fates during early development . At implantation , the embryo is composed of the epiblast , a pluripotent derivative of the inner cell mass ( ICM ) , and the extra - embryonic ectoderm and endoderm tissues , which are fated to generate supporting structures such as the placenta and yolk sac 6 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Identified tissues from early post - implantation ( embryonic day ( E ) 5 . 5 ) mouse embryos were individu - ally explanted onto a feeder layer of irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts . Cells from the extra - embryonic ectoderm and endoderm generated distinct extra - embryonic fates ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The epiblast , which generates all the cell types of the adult , efficiently grew as an epithelial colony when explanted and expressed transcription factors associated with pluripotency , such as Oct3 / 4 ( also known as Pou5f1 ) and Nanog ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) 7 . Theseprimaryepiblastexplantscouldnotinitiallybepropagatedwith the protocol used to passage mouse ES cells but could be extensively passaged ( . 30 ) when a human ES cell procedure was used . Mouse ES cells typically grow in small , compact , domed colonies . EpiSC colonies were larger and grew as a monolayer similar to human ES cells , and continued to express genes associated with pluripotency ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Gene expression was analysed by hybridization toprobesthatrepresentallthetranscriptsinthemousegenome . Cluster analysis showed that independently derived EpiSC lines were similar to eachotheranddistinctfrommouseEScells ( Fig . 1c ) . Thepatternofgene expression in EpiSCs was consistent with that of the post - implantation epiblast and not the pre - implantation ICM ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) 8 . * These authors contributed equally to this work . 1 Laboratory ofMolecularBiology , NationalInstitute ofNeurologicalDisorders and Stroke , NationalInstitutesof Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 , USA . 2 MammalianDevelopment Laboratory , Department ofZoology , University ofOxford , SouthParksRoad , Oxford OX13PS , UK . 3 StemCellBiologySection , NationalCancer Institute , NationalInstitutes ofHealth , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 , USA .

Transfectionofreporterconstructsshowedthatthe distal and proximal enhancers have reciprocal abilities to direct gene expression in mouse ES cells and EpiSCs . The ICM - specific distal en - hancer regulated expression in mouse ES cells and the epiblast - specific proximal enhancer promoted expression in the EpiSCs ( Fig . 1d , e ) . This result shows that EpiSCs are distinct from mouse ES cells and capture transcriptional features of the post - implantation epiblast . Chimaeric mice are efficiently generated when mouse ES cells are introduced into the pre - implantation embryo . The developmental potential of EpiSCs was tested by injection into E3 . 5 host blastocysts . As judged by coat and eye colour contribution , no chimaeras were found among 35 pups from 49 injected and transferred blastocysts in two different experiments using two separate cell lines . During the course of these injections , typical chimaerism levels were obtained with mouse ES cells ( 40 chimaeras from 59 pups ) . Because EpiSCs do not survive well as single cells , we examined their potential to contribute to embryogenesis through morula aggregation . When aggregated with morulae ( n 5 23 ) and cultured for 24 h , we saw no indication that the EpiSCs could integrate effectively into the pre - implantation embryo ( Fig . 2a ) . Strikingly , in the majority of cases , the cells impaired or delayed the development of the embryo . The EpiSCs either remained distinct from the embryo ( Fig . 2a’ , note that the embryo is delayed relative to normal development of the unag - gregated control in Fig . 2a ) or were incorporated within the embryo but remained in the cavity of the blastocyst and not associated with ICM or trophectoderm ( Fig . 2a’’ ) . Native epiblast cells of the post - implantation embryo also do not incorporate into the ICM but are clearly pluripotent 14 , 15 . Owing to cells of epiblast origin being incom - patible with the pre - implantation embryo environment , we tested the potency of our cells in two further ways . Teratomas , disorganized tumours containing multipledifferentiated cell types , are formed when pluripotent cells are grafted into ectopic sites . EpiSCs efficiently formed teratomas from all injections ( n 5 12 ) into athymic nude mice . Teratomas contained extensively differen - tiated cell types including ganglion cells , cartilage , muscle , adipocytes , keratinocytes , ciliated endodermal epithelium with secretory goblet cells , epithelial rosettes , and gut ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . ES cells also differentiate effectively in culture when grown in suspension as aggregates . EpiSCs efficiently formed these embryoid bodies when grown in suspension , and culture of embryoid bodies in serum - free medium resulted in differentiation to predominantly neuroectodermal fates ( Fig . 2c ) . Fetal bovine serum is known to promote mesodermal and endodermal differentiation 16 . When embryoid bodies were generated from EpiSCs in the presence of fetal bovine serum , nearly all embryoid body outgrowths contained contracting cardiomyocytes . Cardiomyocyte differentiation was further confirmed by Nkx2 - 5 immunoreactivity and expression of a cardiac - specific isoform of troponin T ( Fig . 2c ) . Multinucleated , nebulin - positive skeletal myofibres were also present ( Fig . 2c ) . Endoderm - like cells with a characteristic morphology and expressing the transcription factors Gata6 and Sox17 were also observed ( Sup - plementary Fig . 6 ) . The embryoid body differentiation strategy also generated endothelial cells with a typical granular staining for von Willebrand factor ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Although the plating effi - ciency was low ( , 1 – 4 % ) , single EpiSCs could be subcloned . The differentiation repertoire of the clonal cell lines was indistinguishable from the parental line ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . These data show that EpiSCs have a wide developmental potency . To define better their developmental state , the pattern of gene expression in three independent lines of mouse ES cells and EpiSCs was assessed by hybridization to whole - genome expression arrays . The data show that Oct3 / 4 , Nanog and Sox2 were expressed at equi - valent levels in mouse ES cells and EpiSCs ( Fig . 3a ) . Transcripts from genes associated with the ICM such as Pecam1 , Tbx3 and Gbx2 were expressed by mouse ES cells and significantly decreased or not detected in EpiSCs . Transcripts from genes associated with the epi - blast and early germ layers such as Otx2 , Eomes , Foxa2 , brachyury ( T ) , Gata6 , Sox17 and Cer1 were expressed at higher levels in EpiSCs ( Fig . 3a ) . Genes expressed in the epiblast and early germ layers were also detected in human ES cell cultures ( shown in red in Fig . 3a ) , consistent with previous studies showing differences in gene express - ion between mouse and human ES cells 17 , 18 . To confirm these differences , we performed ChIP - on - chip analysis using custom arrays to detect histone modifications indicative of gene induction ( H3K4me3 ) and repression ( H3K27me3 ) 7 . The chro - matin status around the transcriptional start sites was examined for the Stella ( Dppa3 ) , Otx2 and Nanog genes in mouse ES cells , EpiSCs and human ES cells ( red circles in Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Consistent with its restricted expression to mouse ES cells , Stella was only associated with inductive H3K4me3 in those cells , whereas Nanog was associated with this mark in all three cell types . Otx2 had the inductive mark in all three cell types but also the repressive H3K27me3 mark in mouse ES cells . These data show that EpiSCs and human ES cells have common mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of transcription , which are distinct from mouse ES cells .

NATURE | Vol 448 | 12 July 2007 LETTERS 197 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup Recent studies have suggested that Oct3 / 4 , Nanog and Sox2 , in concert with interacting proteins , constitute an autoregulatory , plur - ipotent network 11 , 19 . Dax1 ( Nr0b1 ) has been identified as a central component of the protein interaction network and is required for the maintenance of mouse ES cells in culture 19 , 20 . Although Oct3 / 4 , Nanog and Sox2 were expressed at similar levels in mouse ES cells and EpiSCs , Dax1 was strikingly underexpressed in EpiSCs and human ES cells ( Fig . 3a ) . Because EpiSCs and human ES cells differ significantly from mouse ES cells in their expression of this key com - ponent of the pluripotency network , we asked if the Oct3 / 4 targets differed . Genome - scale location analysis was used to identify Oct3 / 4 targets in mouse ES cells , EpiSCs and human ES cells . The data confirmed previous studies showing limited overlap of Oct3 / 4 targets between mouse ES cells and human ES cells 11 , 12 , while showing a , 7 - fold greater overlap of Oct3 / 4 targets between human ES cells and EpiSCs ( Fig . 3c ) . These data emphasize that distinct transcrip - tional networks operate to maintain pluripotency in epiblast - like cells . Theoriginofthegermlineisanimportantissueinearlyembryology and in the biology of ES cells . Genes associated with the germ line , including Stella , Piwil2 , Stra8 and Dazl were expressed by mouse ES cells and significantly decreased or not detected in EpiSCs and human ES cells ( Fig . 3a ) . This difference in the expression of germ cell specific genes is consistent with expression differences between the ICM and the post - implantation epiblast 21 . Primordial germ cell specification occurs in a precise temporal and spatial manner beginning with Blimp1 ( Prdm1 ) expression in a small number of cells in the posterior , proximal epiblast at E6 . 25 followed by upregulation of Stella around E7 . 25 21 . The growth factor BMP4 has a central role in primordial germ cell differentiation 22 . When EpiSCs were treated with BMP4 , Stella and Blimp1 were both induced in a temporal manner consistent with their specification in vivo ( Fig . 3d ) . These data show that germ cell differ - entiation can be induced in EpiSCs and illustrates the value of EpiSCs as the proximal source of cells with restricted fates . The expression of specific genes suggests that mouse ES cells and EpiSCsaretwodistinctpluripotent statesrepresenting cellsof thepre - implantation embryo and later epiblast cells . Activin A ( Inhb ) / Nodal signalling is known to maintain the undifferentiated state of human EScellsaswellasmousepost - implantation epiblastcells invivo 23 – 25 .

LETTERS NATURE | Vol 448 | 12 July 2007 198 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup receptor - like kinases ( ALK ) 4 , 5 and 7 ( Acvr1b , Tgfbr1 and Acvr1c , respectively ) showed that the activin / Nodal pathway maintains plur - ipotency in EpiSCs . Activin / Nodal inhibition promoted differenti - ation of EpiSCs because colonies adopted a rosette - like morphology characteristic of neural precursors , were negative for pluripotency markers , and expressed genes specific to neuroectodermal fates in 3 days ( Sox1 , Pax6 and Nes ; Supplementary Table 1 ) . An additional day of differentiation resulted in expression of genes found in more mature neural cells ( doublecortin , Dcx ; classIII b - tubulin , Tubb3 ; and tyrosine hydroxylase , Th ; Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . The differentiation of EpiSCs and mouse ES cells was analysed by whole - genome expression when pluripotency signals were blocked with small - molecule inhibitors . Mouse ES cells maintained their plur - ipotency markers even when the activin / Nodal pathway was inhibited ( Fig . 4c , Supplementary Fig . 8 , and Supplementary Table 1 ) 29 . When both JAK and ALK inhibitors were used , mouse ES cells differentiated towards neuroectoderm and were most - closely related to EpiSCs treated with the ALK inhibitor alone ( Figs 4c and Supplementary Table S1 ) . Similar to EpiSCs , human ES cells also rapidly down regu - lated pluripotency genes and acquired neural characteristics when treated with the ALK inhibitor alone ( Supplementary Fig . 8 and Sup - plementary Table 1 ) . These data directly demonstrate that EpiSCs and human ES cells are functionally similar and specify their develop - mental relationship with mouse ES cells ( Fig . 4c , d ) . AlthoughtheuseofhumanEScellspromisessubstantialadvancesin developmental biology and medicine , the differences between mouse and human ES cells have hindered their use . The pluripotent epiblast tissue is composed of the most immediate precursors of the early somatic lineages as well as the germ line . The important point estab - lishedbythismanuscriptisthatstablecelllinesobtainedfromthepost - implantation epiblast of the mouse embryo will aid in understanding the precise controls that regulate the transition from pluripotency to specific cell fates . There is increasing evidence that human ES cells differentiate to clinically relevant fates 30 and we propose a model that may accelerate efforts to realize their promise in medicine . METHODS SUMMARY Derivation and maintenance of cell lines from mouse post - implantation epi - blast . Egg - cylinder - stage embryos in which the pro - amniotic cavity was restricted to the embryonic portion of the conceptus were obtained at E5 . 5 and dissected from their decidua in HEPES - buffered medium . Reichert’s membrane was reflected with forceps or glass needles , and a cut was made with a glass scalpel at the boundary between the extra - embryonic ectoderm and the epiblast . The epiblast was isolated with a hand - pulled glass pipette after trypsin / pancreatin treatment . The isolated epiblast fragments were explanted one per 1 . 9cm 2 well onto feeders in medium that consisted of DMEM - F12 ( Invitrogen ) , 20 % knockout serum replacement ( KSR ) , 5ngml 2 1 FGF2 ( R & D Systems ) , 0 . 1mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( Sigma ) , 2mM L - glutamine , and 1 3 non - essential amino acids ( both from Invitrogen ) . EpiSCs were passaged every 2 – 3 days with collagenase type IV ( Invitrogen ) and triturated into small clumps .

For clarity in this report , we refer to mouse ES cell lines derived from embryos prior to implantation in the uterus as ‘mouse ES cells’ and those reported herein from the epiblast of post - implantation mouse embryos as ‘EpiSCs . ’ Embryos . Naturalmatingswere usedfor allexperiments . Twelvehoursfromthe middle of the dark period was termed embryonic day 0 . 5 ( E0 . 5 ) . Egg cylinder stage embryos in which the pro - amniotic cavity was restricted to the embryonic portion of the conceptus were obtained on E5 . 5 ( 6 4h ) from the 129SvEv ( Taconic ) or 129S2 / SvHsd ( Charles River ) strains . Murine embryonic fibro - blasts ( MEFs ) were obtained from E13 . 5 fetuses from the PO or CF1 strain . Morulae and blastocysts for chimaera experiments were obtained from the MF1 or ICR strain on E2 . 5 or E3 . 5 . PO or ICR females made pseudopregnant by mating with vasectomised males were used as recipients for embryo transfer on E2 . 5 . MouseandhumanEScelllines . MouseEScellsmm10d , mm11e , mb1 , ESF58 / 2 , ESF122andESF175 / 1wereculturedonirradiatedMEFs ( feeders ) withmouseES cell medium , which consisted of Knockout DMEM ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco ) or Knockout Serum Replacement ( KSR ) ( Invitrogen ) , 1 3 10 3 unitsml 2 1 recombinantmurineleukemiainhibitory factor ( LIF ) ( ESGRO , Chemicon International ) , 2mM L - glutamine , 1 3 non - essential amino acids ( both from Invitrogen ) , and 0 . 1mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( Sigma ) . Mouse ES cells were passaged every third day as a singe cell suspension using 0 . 25 % trypsin / EDTA and seeded at 3 . 0 3 10 4 cells per cm 2 for routine culture . Human ES cell lines H9 ( WiCell Research Institute ; NIH Code WA09 ) , hESBGN - 03 ( BresaGen , Inc . ; NIH Code BG03 ) , and HES - 1 ( ES Cell International ; NIH Code ES01 ) were cultured on feeders with human ES cell medium , which consisted of DMEM - F12 ( Invitrogen ) , 20 % KSR , 5ngml 2 1 FGF2 ( R & D Systems ) , 2mM L - glutamine , 0 . 1mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , and 1 3 non - essentialaminoacids . HumanEScellswerepassagedevery4 – 6dayswith enzymes ( 1mgml 2 1 collagenase type IV and 1mgml 2 1 dispase ; both from Invitrogen ) and triturated into small clumps of , 10 – 100 cells . MEFs were irra - diatedwith30 – 60grayandwereseededasfeedersatadensityof4 . 8 3 10 4 cellsper cm 2 and 1 . 88 3 10 4 cells per cm 2 for mouse and human ES cell cultures respect - ively . MEFs and feeders were maintained with DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , 2mM L - glutamine , and 0 . 1mM 2 - mercaptoethanol . All cells were grown on Nunclon D - treated dishes or multiwell plates ( Fisher Scientific ) coated for 2h at 37 u C with 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) gelatin ( Sigma ) . Derivation and maintenance of cell lines from mouse post - implantation epi - blast . E5 . 5 embryos were dissected from their decidua in HEPES - buffered med - ium 31 . Reichert’s membrane was reflected with forceps or glass needles and a cut was made at the boundary between the extra - embryonic ectoderm and the epiblast with a glass scalpel . The embryonic fragment containing the epiblast andoverlyingvisceralendodermwasincubatedfor8minsat4 u Cinasolutionof 0 . 5 % trypsin and 2 . 5 % pancreatin in PBS and subsequently returned to dissec - tion medium . The embryos were drawn into a hand - pulled glass pipette with a diameterslightlysmallerthanthefragmenttopeelawaythevisceralendoderm 32 . TheisolatedepiblastfragmentswererinsedinEScellmediumandexplantedoneper1 . 9cm 2 well . A variety of conditions were tested to maintain the epiblast explantsinanundifferentiated , pluripotentstate . BothmouseandhumanEScell conditions were used along with the growth factors FGF2 , activin A , BMP2 and BMP4 ( all from R & D Systems ) , and murine LIF ( Chemicon ) . The density of feeder cells was crucial to maintaining the epiblast cells in an undifferentiated state . Alowfeederdensityresultedindifferentiationinto b - IIItubulin 1 neurons , whereas a high feeder density resulted in endoderm - like differentiation around the edgesofthe colonies . Additionof 10ngml 2 1 of activin Ato epiblastexplants on a low feeder density was sufficient to prevent neural differentiation . Higher concentrations of activin A resulted in differentiation . Addition of exogenous LIF did not drastically alter the cultures . Addition of 25ngml 2 1 BMP2 or BMP4 with or without LIF promoted differentiation . EpiSCs were optimally main - tained with human ES cell passaging methods and medium containing FGF2 on a feeder density of 4 . 8 3 10 4 cells per cm 2 . EpiSCs were passaged every 2 – 3 days . Small - molecule treatment . SB431542 was maintained as a 20mM stock solu - tion in DMSO ( vehicle ) and was provided to the cultures at the time of plating and every 24h thereafter with the media change . JAK inhibitor I ( Calbiochem 420099 ) was maintained as a 10mM stock in DMSO and provided every 24h . Plating efficiency assays and subcloning . To obtain a pure , single cell suspen - sion of mouse ES cells or EpiSCs , colonies were treated with 1 . 5mgml 2 1 col - lagenase for 10mins and dislodged from the feeder layer with gentle pipetting . Colonies were settled away from any remaining feeders by gravity in a conical tube . Colonies were then trypsinized for 3mins and counted . For plating effi - ciency assays , cells were plated onto feeders in 1 . 9cm 2 wells at a density of 100cells per cm 2 with vehicle or 0 . 6 m M JAK inhibitor I ( n 5 4 wells per condition for each cell line examined ) . mm11e , ESF122 and ESF175 / 1 were used for the mouse ES cell samples and EpiSC - 5 and EpiSC - 7 were used for mouse EpiSC samples . Colonies were counted 4 days later . Results are presented as mean 6 standarddeviation . Treatments thatsignificantlydifferedfromcontrols were identified using a paired , two - tailed Student’s t - test ( Microsoft Excel ) . Forsubcloning , EpiSC - 5P22cellswereindividuallyplated ( 1cellperwell ) onto feeders in wells of a 96 - well plate with the addition of 0 . 4 m M JAK inhibitor I . Five days later individual colonies were picked and dissociated in 8 m l drops of trypsin and plated into a fresh well of feeders . Clones were subsequently propa - gated using standard EpiSC passaging conditions . Analysis of genomic integrity . Chromosome preparation and G - banding was carriedoutasdescribedpreviously 5 , 33 . ForComparativeGenomicHybridization ( CGH ) genomic DNA was isolated from cell lines or mouse liver using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit ( Promega ) . Samples were processed for CGH analysis according to the Agilent Oligonucleotide Array - Based CGH ProtocolVersion4 . 0 . Briefly , 2 . 1ugofgenomicDNAwasdigestedwith Alu 1and Rsa 1 . Digested DNA was labelled with either Cy3 - dUTP or Cy5 - dUTP using the Agilent Genomic DNA labelling Kit PLUS for 2h , and purified with Microcon YM - 30 filter units . Mouse 244A CGH arrays ( Agilent ) were hybridized with a labelled experimental sample and a labelled normal control sample . The control sample was isolated from liver of the same mouse strain as the experimental sample but was of opposite sex . The sex chromosome difference between the control and experimental samples was an internal control for the loss or gain of genetic material . Samples were hybridized for 40h at 65 u C and washed with Agilent Oligo aCGH Wash Buffers 1 and 2 . Processed arrays were scanned using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner controlled by Scanner Control Software v7 . 0 and the data were extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9 . 1 . Data were analysed using CGH Analytics v3 . 4 ( Agilent ) . Mouse and human ES cells are capable of maintaining a normal karyotype in culture but are susceptible to some specific chromosomal abnormalities of the autosomes and the sex chromosomes . Human ES cells with an XX chromosome constitution are capable of maintaining both X - chromosomes even after extens - ive passaging , whereas XX mouse ES cells are unstable and typically lose one X duringearlypassage 34 . IndependentEpiSClines , EpiSC - 3 ( 40 , XX ) , EpiSC - 5 ( 40 , XY ) , and EpiSC - 7 ( 40 , XX ) were karyotypically normal at passages 20 , 17 , and 22 , respectively . At high passage ( p33 ) an abnormal marker chromosome ( a presumptive reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 3 ) was observed in one preparation of line EpiSC - 7 . Owing to this , EpiSC - 7 cells were not used beyond passage 26 for this study . The genetic integrity of the EpiSC - 5 lineandtwoderivativesubcloneswasfurtherexaminedbyhigh - resolutioncom - parative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) . The parental line and one subclone ( clone O ) seemed normal , whereas the other subclone ( clone L ) showed an amplification of part of chromosome 8 ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) ; a common aberration previously found in mouse ES cells . Differentiation . The potential of EpiSCs was tested in vivo by introducing the cells into blastocyst - stage embryos ( lines EpiSC - 2 and EpiSC - 3 ) . Methods for blastocyst injection were used as described previously 5 , 35 . Chimaerism was judged by coat and eye color contribution . In addition , EpiSCs were transiently transfected with pMAX - GFP ( Amaxa ) and aggregated as small clumps with morula stage embryos in depression wells . The aggregates were cultured in KSOM and the incorporation / contribution of GFP 1 EpiSCs was judged 24 – 36 hours later . The developmental potential of EpiSC lines was assessed in vitro by forming embryoid bodies . Collagenase - isolated colonies were triturated into small clumps and grown for 1wk in suspension using ultra - low attachment dishes ( Corning ) . Embryoid bodies were subsequently plated 1 per well into gelatin - or fibronectin - coated 24 - well plates . Culture medium consisted of DMEM with either 10 % FBS or 15 % KSR . For analysis of germ cell differentiation , EpiSC embryoid bodies were treated with 50ngml 2 1 BMP4 ( R & D Systems ) or vehicle in medium containing 10 % FBS . EpiSC lines were also tested for their ability to form teratomas in immuno - compromized hosts . The inguinal mammary fat pads of female mice ( athymic nu / nu , 23 days of age ; NCI , Frederick , Maryland ) were cleared of epithelium as described previously 36 . EpiSC colonies were detached with collagenase and settled from feeders by gravity . Colonies were triturated to produce small cell clusters and these were resuspended in DMEM containing 10 % FBS to 0 . 02 3 10 6 cells m l 2 1 . Cells ( lines EpiSC - 5 and EpiSC - 7 ) were injected bilaterally intotheclearedmammaryfatpads ( 3miceperline ; 0 . 2 3 10 6 cellsin10 m lperfat pad ) . Tumours were allowed to develop for 3 – 6 weeks , at which time they were removed and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde . Teratomas were embedded in paraffin , sectioned , and processed for immunohistochemistry or stained with haematoxylin and eosin . For immunohistochemistry , samples were deparaffi - nized with xylene , rehydrated and subjected to antigen unmasking ( boiling in 0 . 01Mcitratefor5mins ) .

Immunostaining . Cells were prepared for immunostaining by fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) for 20mins and subsequent permeabilizationfor15minswith0 . 2 % Triton - XinPBS . Cellswerethenblocked for non - specific binding with 10 % normal goat or donkey serum ( Abcam ) in PBS for 2h at room temperature . Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the samples overnight at 4 u C . Samples were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes or Jackson ImmunoResearch , 1 : 500 ) for 2h at room temperature . Primary antibodies used were : mouse monoclonal IgG2b Oct3 / 4 ( C - 10 ; Santa Cruz , 1 : 400 ) , rabbit polyclonal Oct3 / 4 ( H - 134 ; Santa Cruz , 1 : 400 ) , mouse monoclonal IgG1 Cdx2 ( CDX2 - 88 ; Biogenex , 1 : 50 ) , rabbit polyclonal Nanog ( kindly provided by Dr .

Nuclei were visua - lized with DAPI ( 1 m gml 2 1 ) . Western blotting . Cultures were pre - incubated with JAK inhibitor I ( 0 . 6 m M ) or vehicle and whole colonies were isolated , removed from feeders , and allowed to attach onto dishes coated with laminin ( Roche ) in DMEM supple - mented with 15 % KSR . After attachment , cultures were challenged with LIF ( 2 3 10 3 unitsml 2 1 ) for 45mins and lysed in 2 3 SDS Lysis Buffer ( 1 3 , 50mM Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 100mM DTT , 2 % SDS , 0 . 1 % bromophenol blue , and 10 % glycerol ) . Equivalent amounts of protein extract were separated by SDS - PAGE ( 7 % Tris - Acetategels , Invitrogen ) andtransferredtoanitrocellulose membrane ( 0 . 45 m m pore , Invitrogen ) . Membranes were blocked with 5 % milk in TBS and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 u C . Membranes were rinsed and incubated with HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies for 1h at room temperature , followed by chemiluminescent detection using SuperSignal West Pico Substrate ( Pierce ) . Primary antibodies used were : rabbit polyclonal STAT3 ( C - 20 ; Santa Cruz , 1 : 500 ) , rabbit polyclonal STAT3 p - Y705 ( 9131 ; Cell Signalling , 1 : 1000 ) , mouse monoclonal Oct3 / 4 ( C - 10 ; Santa Cruz , 1 : 1000 ) , and mouse monoclonal a - tubulin ( clone B - 5 - 1 - 2 ; Sigma , 1 : 6000 ) . RNA preparation and RT – PCR . Cultures were treated with 1 . 5mgml 2 1 col - lagenase in KSR - containing medium for 10mins at 37 u C . The collagenase solu - tion was removed and fresh medium was added to the cultures . Colonies were dislodged from the feeder layer , if present , by gentle pipetting . Colonies were settled away from any remaining feeder cells by gravity in a conical tube . Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) and samples were treated with DNase ( DNA - free , Ambion ) . RNA ( 200ng ) was reverse - transcribed using Superscript III ( Invitrogen ) with random primers . For semi - quantitative RT – PCR , complementary DNA was amplified for 30 cycles with Taq polymerase ( Roche ) using gene specific primers , and products were analysed on ethidium - bromide - stained agarose gels . All primer sequences except those for actin were adopted from ones described previously 37 : Oct4 , forward 5 9 - CGTTCTCTT - TGGAAAGGTGTTC - 3 9 , reverse 5 9 - GAACCATACTCGAACCACATCC - 3 ; Zfp42 ( Rex1 ) , forward 5 9 - TGAAAGTGAGATTAGCCCCGAG - 3 9 , reverse 5 9 - GTCCCATCCCCTTCAATAGCAC - 3 9 ; Fgf5 , forward5 9 - CTGTACTGCAGAG - TGGGCATCGG - 3 9 , reverse 5 9 - GACTTCTGCGAGGCTGCGACAGG - 3 9 ; actin , forward 5’ - CTAGACTTCGAGCAGGAGATGGC - 3 9 , reverse 5 9 - TCTGCATC - CTGTCAGCAATGCC - 3 9 . Real - time PCR was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the Applied Biosystems ( ABI ) 7900HT instrument with the ABI TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and Taqman pre - optimized gene expression assays ( Prdm1 ( Blimp1 ) , Mm00476128 _ m1 ; Dppa3 ( Stella ) , Mm00836373 _ g1 ; Gapdh , 4352662 ) . Reporter gene assays . For the Oct3 / 4 DE - SV40 - Luc and Oct3 / 4 PE - SV40 - Luc constructs , mouse genomic DNA containing the previously described Oct3 / 4 enhancers 13 was amplified and inserted into the pCR2 . 1 - TOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) . The following primers were used to amplify the appropriate genomic fragments : DE , forward 5 9 - ACGTAAGTACTTCAGACACCAGAAG - AGG - 3 9 , reverse5 9 - GAGCCTACCCTGAACTTCCCTAGAGTG - 3 9 ; PE , forward 5 9 - CACTCTAGGGAAGTTCAGGGTAGGCTC - 3 9 , reverse 5 9 - AAAGCCTG - TTGGCACTGCACCCTCTCGG - 3 9 . The inserts were cut from the pCR2 . 1 - TOPO vector using Xho I and Kpn 1 and inserted into the pGL3 - Promoter Vector ( Promega ) , which was digested with Xho I and Kpn I using standard clon - ing techniques . All constructs were sequenced . For the luciferase assays , equi - molar amounts of each construct were transfected into 2 . 5 3 10 6 cells using the Amaxa Nucleofection kit along with the pRL - TK vector for normalization . Assays were performed 24 – 48 hours later using the Dual - Glo Luciferase Assay System ( Promega ) andsignalsweredetectedusingaWallacVictor3PlateReader ( Perkin Elmer ) . The basal activity of the empty luciferase vector was set as 1 . 0 . Expression microarrays . Agilent : Cy3 - CTP labelled cRNA was produced from 200ng of total RNA using the Agilent Low RNA Input Liner Amplification Kit . After labelling and cRNA purification , cRNA was quantified using the NanoDrop ND - 1000 UV - VIS Spectrophotometer . Cy3 - labelled cRNA ( 1 . 65 m g ) was hybridized per individual 44K array on catalogue Agilent 4x44K Mouse ( G4122F ) or Human ( G4112F ) whole - genome microarrays for 17h at 65 u C ( 10r . p . m . ) . After hybridization , arrays were washed consecutively with Agilent gene expression wash buffers one and two , and acetonitrile for 1min each , followed by a final 30 second wash in Agilent Stabilization and Drying solution . Slides were scanned immediately following washing in the Agilent Scanner using Scan Control 7 . 0 software . The scan resolution was 5 m m and the eXtended Dynamic range feature ( XDR Hi 100 % , XDR Low 10 % ) was used to avoid saturated features . Scan data were extracted with Feature Extraction 9 . 1 software using the GE1 - V5 _ 91 protocol . Extracted signal intensities were ana - lysed using GeneSpring 7 . 3 . 1 software and the datasets were normalized using standard Agilent FE Import 1 - color settings . This normalization procedure accounted for interchip variability by adjusting the intensity distribution to the 50th percentile . Comparison of mouse ES cells and EpiSCs was done using 3 biological repli - catesforeachcelltype . FormouseEScells , lines ESF175 / 1 p16 , ESF58 / 2p15 , and ESF122 p12 were used and EpiSC - 7 P20 , EpiSC - 5 P22 , and EpiSC - 7 p25 were used for the EpiSC samples . The expression of each gene in the mouse ES cell dataset was compared to the matching gene in the EpiSC dataset through a per genemedianscaling . Resultingnormalizedintensityvaluesequalto1 . 0indicated that the gene was expressed equally in the two cell types , whereas values greater than 1 . 0 indicated elevated gene expression and values less than 1 . 0 indicated decreased expression as compared to the other cell type . Human ES cell lines H9 P52 , ES01 P66 , and BG03 P49 were used as the 3 biological replicates for the human ES cell dataset . Because no comparison was made with other human cell types , the per gene median scaling was excluded in the human ES cell analysis . When comparing the effect of SB431542 treatment on mouse ES cells and EpiSCs two separate biological replicates were used for the analysis ( ESF122 and ESF175 / 1for mouse EScell samples , and EpiSC - 5and EpiSC - 7 for mouseEpiSC samples ) . For each cell type , time - course samples were normalized to the non - treated samples and therefore all non - treated samples had a value of approxi - mately 1 . 0 . The normalized values for genes up regulated by the SB431542 were greater than 1 . 0 and those decreased by the treatment were less than 1 . 0 . Gene lists of statistically significant ( P , 0 . 05 ) 2 . 5 - fold up regulated or 2 . 5 - fold down regulated genes were obtained from GeneSpring . Analysis of SB431542 treat - ment of human ES cells was performed as above for cell line H9 P43 . Average linkage cluster maps and correlation coefficients between transcript expression datasets were generated using Genespring software . A maximal value of 1 . 0 indicates equivalent detection of over 41 , 000 genes and transcripts repre - sented on the Agilent mouse whole - genome oligo microarray . Illumina : the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit ( Ambion ) was used toamplify100ngoftotalRNAfromeachsample . cRNAwasquantifiedusingthe Quant - iT RiboGreen RNA Reagent ( Invitrogen ) , and 1 . 5 m g of material was hybridized to Illumina Sentrix Human - 6 Expression Beadchips for 17h at 55 u C . Beadchips were washed and stained according to the protocol described intheWhole - GenomeGeneExpressionforBeadstationManualRevisionD . The Beadchips were scanned in an Illumina BeadStation controlled by BeadScan software . Data were analysed using the gene expression module of BeadStudio 2 . 3 . 33 software and datasets were normalized using rank invariant normaliza - tion . Illumina arrays provide bead redundancy and therefore each gene or tran - script is represented an average of 30 times on each array . Owing to this , a detection P value can be calculated for each gene or transcript . Detection P values less than 0 . 01 were considered significant . Human Sox2 expression was only analysed on the Agilent arrays because there is a known defect with the Sox2 bead on this version of the Illumina bead array . Chromatin immunoprecipitation on DNA microarrays ( ChIP - on - chip ) . ChIP - on - chipwasperformedusingtheAgilentmammalianprotocolwithmodi - fication . To immunoprecipitate chromatin , 5 3 10 7 cells were treated with 1 % formaldehyde atroomtemperaturefor10minsfollowedbyexposureto0 . 125M glycineandasubsequentwashinPBS . CellswerelysedinCellLysisBuffer ( 5mM doi : 10 . 1038 / nature05972 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup HEPES , pH 8 . 0 , 85mM KCL , 0 . 5 % Triton ) for 5mins on ice and the nuclei were re - suspended in Nuclei Lysis Buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCL , pH 8 . 0 , 10mM EDTA , 1 % SDS ) . Lysates were sonicated under conditions yielding fragments ranging from 200bp to 1 , 000bp . Samples were subsequently pre - cleared at 4 u C with recombinant protein G agarose beads ( Invitrogen ) coated in yeast transfer RNA for1h . Threepercentofthesonicatedmaterialwasreservedaswhole - cellextract material . Precleared lysate was diluted 1 : 10 in IP buffer ( 0 . 01 % SDS , 1 . 1 % Triton , 1 . 2mM EDTA , 16 . 7mM Tris - HCL , pH 8 . 0 , 167mM NaCl ) for an overnight immunoprecipitation with specific antibody at 4 u C with rocking . Antibodies used were : Oct3 / 4 ( Santa Cruz sc - 9081x Lot no . J1703 ) , trimethyl - histoneH3K4 ( Abcamno . ab8580 Lotno . 122062 ) or trimethyl - histone H3K27 ( Abcam no . ab6002 Lot no . 222266 ) . We used 1 . 5 m g of antibody per 1 3 10 6 cells . Complexeswerecollectedfor4hoursusingrecombinantproteinGagarose beads ( Invitrogen ) coated in BSA and yeast tRNA . Samples were washed for 10mins in each of the following buffers ; IP dilution buffer , Dialysis Buffer ( 2mM EDTA , 50mM Tris - HCL , pH8 , 0 . 2 % Sarkosyl ) , TSE - 500 ( 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton , 2mM EDTA , 20mM Tris - HCL , pH8 , 500mM NaCl ) , LiCl Wash ( 100mM Tris - HCl , pH8 , 500mM LiCl , 1 % Triton , 1 % Deoxycholic acid ) , and TE Buffer . After washing , samples were eluted in Elution Buffer ( 50mM NaHCO3 , 1 % SDS ) , andformaldehydecross - linkswerereversedbyanovernight incubation at 65 u C . Samples were purified through PCR Purification Kit col - umns ( Qiagen ) . Immunoprecipitation - enriched and whole - cell extract DNA was blunted using the DNA Terminator End Repair Kit ( Lucigen ) before linker ligation and amplification , which was performed according to the Agilent pro - tocol . Labelling was performed using the Bioprime DNA Labeling System ( Invitrogen ) and Cy3 - dUTP or Cy5 - dUTP ( Amersham ) . Human G4489A and mouse G4490A 244K promoter arrays ( Agilent ) were probed for 40h at 65 u C and subsequently scanned using an Agilent Scanner controlled by Agilent Scan Control 7 . 0 software . Custom 244K mouse and human ChIP - on - chip arrays were designed using eArray ( Agilent ) and processed as described above . Data wereextractedwithAgilentFeatureExtraction9 . 1software . Oct3 / 4 - boundgenes were called using Agilent’s ChIP Analytics 1 . 3 software , incorporating the Whitehead Error Model , which has a false - positive rate of approximately 0 . 5 % and a false - negative rate of approximately 20 % ( ref . 11 ) . A Venn diagram was created for overlapping and non - overlapping Oct3 / 4 - bound genes in mouse ES cells , mouse EpiSCs and human ES cells . Genes were only included in the com - parison if they had a homologue on the other species’ array . For example , probe data for the Nanog gene were not present in the mouse array dataset and there - fore Nanog was not included in the cross - species comparison . Probes that were associated with modified histones were called on the basis of a neighbourhood P value of less than 0 . 01 ( Agilent ChIP Analytics 1 . 3 Software ) . Mapping of bound probes was performed in the UCSC genome browser using genome build mm7 ( August 2005 ) for mouse and HG17 ( May 2004 ) for human 38 . 31 . Downs , K . M .
