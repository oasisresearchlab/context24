However , the mechanism whereby SARS - CoV - 2 invades host cells remains poorly understood . Here we used SARS - CoV - 2 pseudoviruses to infect human angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) expressing HEK293T cells and evaluated virus infection . We confirmed that SARS - CoV - 2 entry was dependent on ACE2 and sensitive to pH of endosome / lysosome in HEK293T cells . The infection of SARS - CoV - 2 pseudoviruses is independent of dynamin , clathrin , caveolin and endophilin A2 , as well as macropinocytosis . Instead , we found that the infection of SARS - CoV - 2 pseudoviruses was cholesterol - rich lipid raft dependent . Cholesterol depletion of cell membranes with methyl - β - cyclodextrin resulted in reduction of pseudovirus infection . The infection of SARS - CoV - 2 pseudoviruses resumed with cholesterol supplementation . Together , cholesterol - rich lipid rafts , and endosomal acidification , are key steps of SARS - CoV - 2 required for infection of host cells . Therefore , our ﬁnding expands the understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 entry mechanism and provides a new anti - SARS - CoV - 2 strategy . Key words : SARS - CoV - 2 , endocytosis , endosomal acidification , lipid rafts , cholesterol . 3 Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , has rapidly increased in epidemic scale of the world since its initial outbreak during the winter of 2019 [ 1 , 2 ] . Up to march , 2021 the number of confirmed cases worldwide exceeds 100 million , with more than 2 . 15 million deaths . This pandemic is of international concern and subject to intense investigations and many pathological features of COVID - 19 have yet to be characterized . To enter the host cells , viruses specifically interact with a membrane component and subsequently integrate in the cell membrane to release the genome into the cytosol , or alternatively take advantage of the endocytic pathway [ 3 , 4 ] . The cellular entry of SARS - CoV - 2 has been shown to be facilitated by the serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) for spike ( S ) protein priming [ 5 ] . Moreover , Hoffmann et al . [ 5 ] and Zhu et al . [ 6 ] found that SARS - CoV - 2 preferentially enters cells through the plasma membrane fusion pathway in Calu - 3 cells expressing the TMPRSS2 , whereas SARS - CoV - 2 enters via endosomal pathway in HEK293T and Vero cells that express no or minimal TMPRSS2 . In the endocytic pathway , the virus activation is driven by successful internalization , proteolysis and processing in endosomes / lysosomes , a process typically enhanced by an acidic endosomal pH [ 7 ] . Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) has been reported as the cellular receptor for both SARS - CoV - 1 and SARS - CoV - 2 [ 8 - 10 ] . However , we still lack the detailed understanding of the cell endocytic process of how SARS‐CoV‐2 enters the host cells after binding to the ACE2 receptor . Viruses typically make use of various endocytic mechanisms physiologically directed to promote the absorption of fluids , solutes , and small particles . Briefly , the endocytosis pathways could be divided into dynamin - dependent pathways such as clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , caveolin - 4 mediated endocytosis ( CaME ) , fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) , and dynamin - independent pathways including macropinocytosis and lipid rafts , all of which have been studied in the context of virus entry [ 3 , 11 ] . A number of viruses including vesicular stomatitis viruses ( VSV ) , Influenza A and Semliki forest take advantage of CME pathway to enter host cells [ 12 , 13 ] . A number of adaptors , scission factors , cytoskeleton and regulatory factors participate in this process , such as dynamin 2 , AP - 2 , Eps15 , epsin1 , actin , Rab5 , Rab7 , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 [ 3 , 14 ] . CaME is another important pathway for viruses to enter host cells and caveolin1 is necessary ( and perhaps sufﬁcient ) for caveolar biogenesis . Simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) has been widely studied and proposed to enter cells by CaME [ 15 - 17 ] . Recently , it was reported that SV40 particles enter the cell by binding to the carbohydrate moiety of the GM1 ganglioside in the plasma membrane of the host cell [ 18 ] . CaME is dynamin 2 - dependent and is closely related to actin , Rab5 , tyrosine kinases , phosphatases and protein kinase C ( PKC ) [ 3 , 19 ] . In 2015 , Boucrot et al . found a new endocytic route called FEME , which is mediated by endophilin and independent of clathrin and AP - 2 . FEME can be blocked by inhibitors of dynamin , Rac , phosphatidylinositol - 3 - OH kinase , PAK1 and actin polymerization , and be activated upon CDC42 inhibition [ 20 ] . Endophilin A2 has also been found to be associated with enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) entry [ 21 ] , exocytosis of neurosecretory vesicles [ 22 ] , and early uptake structures that are induced by the bacterial Shiga and cholera toxins [ 23 ] . Importantly , SARS - CoV entry into host cells has been shown to occur through a novel clathrin - and caveolin - independent endocytic pathway , suggesting an involvement of dynamin - independent pathways [ 7 ] . Macropinocytosis , also known as cell drinking , is characterized by the formation of large ( > 200 nm in diameter ) and ruffled protrusions of the cell membrane , driven by actin rearrangements , which is primarily mediating non - selective internalization of fluid and membrane [ 24 ] . Vaccina virus 5 mature virion ( VV MV ) , adenovirus 3 ( Ad3 ) , coxsackievirus B ( CVB ) , herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV1 ) , echovirus 1 ( EV1 ) and Zaire ebolavirus ( ZEBOV ) were found to be depended on macropinocytosis for its internalization and infection [ 24 - 28 ] . Macropinocytosis is characterized by the involvement of cell signaling factors PAK1 , PI ( 3 ) K , PKC , Akt , PKC , PLCc , Rab34 and PLC - A2 that act to promote membrane ruffling by stimulating actin remodeling through CDC42 and Rac [ 24 ] . Lipid rafts are liquid - ordered membranes , enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids , involved in biosynthetic transport , endocytosis and signal transduction . Viruses are also believed to take advantage of lipid rafts for entry into their cell host , assembly , and budding [ 29 ] . For several viruses , membrane rafts have been suggested to be involved in the mediation of the entry of enveloped viruses , including influenza virus , Sindbis virus ( SIN ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , murine leukemia virus ( MLV ) , measles virus , Ebola virus and SARS - CoV [ 29 - 34 ] . In addition , other endocytic pathways such as IL - 2 , ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( Arf6 ) and ﬂotillin - dependent pathways have also been studied regarding their importance for viral entry [ 3 , 35 , 36 ] . However , the exact pathway for the entry to the host cells of SARS - CoV - 2 is still unclear . As SARS - CoV - 2 is highly contagious , studies on this virus must be handled in biosafety level 3 or 4 containment laboratories , which often hinders pathological research of the SARS - CoV - 2 and development of vaccine . Pseudoviruses are deprived of critical gene sequences of importance for virulence , while envelopes of these viral particles could have similar conformational structures as wild - type viruses , making it feasible to be handled in biosafety level 2 laboratories [ 37 ] . Particularly , the artificially inserting reporter sequences of luciferase and green fluorescence protein ( GFP ) makes the pseudoviruses to be a powerful tool for studying early infection events in the life cycle of SARS - CoV - 2 . Here , we used SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses to infect HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells , 6 and characterized the contribution of each endocytic pathway to the entry and infection of pseudoviruses by quantitative analysis of luminescence and fluorescence intensity . The cholesterol - rich lipid rafts and endosomal acidification dependence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection was finally clarified . This study provides novel information regarding the entry of SARS - CoV - 2 , which is likely to be useful in understanding the pathological characteristics of this virus , and also provide attractive therapeutic targets to block SARS - CoV - 2 infections . Materials and Methods Cells and culture In order to examine the infection of SARS - CoV - 2 pseudoviruses , we obtained an HEK293T cell line which stably and highly expressed human ACE2 . HEK293T cells were from ATCC and HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were constructed by Genomeditech ( Shanghai , China ) [ 38 ] . Briefly , HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were produced by constructing hACE2 overexpression vector ( pGMLV - PA6 ) and using lentivirus ( pGMLV - CMV - H - ACE2 - PGK - Puro ) to infect the target cells to construct a stable cell line . HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose medium ( Hyclone , USA ) containing 10 % FBS ( HyClone , USA ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin at 37℃ in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were maintained in DMEM with 10 % FBS , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin and 4 μg / ml puromycin at 37℃ in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 .

The pseudoviruses were produced in HEK293T cells with a retrovirus backbone , which membrane surface contains the S protein of SARS - CoV - 2 , and the RNA sequence of green fluorescent protein ( zsGreen ) and luciferase is packaged in its genome . Cytotoxicity assay Cell viability was evaluated using a cell counting kit 8 ( CCK - 8 ) ( Bimake , USA ) and following the manufacturer ' s instructions . Briefly , HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were seeded into 96‐well plates at a density of five thousand cells per well and then treated with different concentrations of chemical inhibitors for 24 h , and then 10 μl of CCK - 8 solution was added to each well followed by an additional 2 h incubation at 37°C . Relative cell viability was assessed by monitoring the absorption at 450 nm using a multiskan spectrum ( Thermo , USA ) . The percentage of viable cells was calculated using the formula : [ ( OD Treated − OD Blank ) / ( OD Control − OD Blank ) ] × 100 % . Each sample was assayed with four 8 replicates per measurement , and each experiment was repeated three times . Pseudovirus infection assay The SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection assays were conducted as described previously [ 38 ] . In brief , 2 × 10 4 of HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were seeded into white 96‐well plates . SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses ( multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) = 10 ) were added into medium and incubated in a 37 °C incubator containing 5 % CO 2 for 4 h . Subsequently , cells were washed once with PBS and replaced by 200 μl of fresh DMEM . To test the pseudovirus infection , the luciferase luminescence was detected by a microplate reader ( Thermo Electron Corporation ) and the GFP in HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells was observed with a fluorescence microscope ( Nikon , Japan ) . siRNA assay siRNA against endophilin A2 ( si - EA2 ) ( 5’ - GCU GGA UGA UGA CUU CAA A - 3’ , 5’ - UUU GAA GUC AUC AUC CAG C - 3’ ) clathrin ( si - clathrin ) ( 5’ - GAG GUC AAU UCU CUA CUG A - 3’ , 5’ - UCA GUA GAG AAU UGA CCU C - 3’ ) , dynamin ( si - dynamin ) ( 5’ - CCG CAG CCA GAA GGA UAU U - 3’ , 5’ - UUU GAA GUC AUC AUC CAG C - 3’ ) and caveolin - 1 ( si - CAV1 ) ( 5’ - CCA GAA GGG ACA CAC AGU U - 3’ , 5’ - AACUGUGUGUCCCUUCUGG - 3’ ) were designed and produced by GenePharma ( Shanghai , China ) , and nonspecific siRNA sequences were used as a control ( si - NC ) . The siRNA was transfected into HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells using Lipo8000 Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The protein levels of EA2 and caveolin 1 were tested by Western blotting to evaluate the silence efficiency before the subsequent assays were performed . For the infection assay , HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells transfected with siRNA were incubated with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses for 4 h , and then the unbound pseudovirus were removed by washing with PBS , and cells were incubated in fresh DMEM medium . The GFP fluorescence intensity and 9 luciferase activity were detected at indicated time points . Virus infection in the presence of inhibitors HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were pre - treated with different concentrations of inhibitors ( chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine , NH 4 Cl , baﬁlomycin A1 , dynasore , CPZ , EIPA , NSC 23766 trihydrochloride , IPA - 3 , MβCD or ML141 ) for 1 h and then incubated with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses at 37℃ in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 for 4 h . In these total 5 hours , the inhibitors were present in the medium . Subsequently , the unbound pseudoviruses were removed by washing with PBS , and cells were incubated in fresh DMEM medium . At different time points , the GFP fluorescence intensity and luciferase activity were detected . Cholesterol supplement For cholesterol supplement experiments , cells , firstly pre - treated with MβCD ( 2 . 5 mM ) for 1 h , were added with diﬀerent concentration of cholesterol for 1 h , followed by the incubation of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses ( MOI = 10 ) for 4 h . In addition , cells were directly treated with diﬀerent concentration of cholesterol for 1 h and incubated with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses ( MOI = 10 ) for 4 h . Protein extraction and Western blotting Total protein lysates from cells were extracted by using the RIPA solution ( Beyotime , China ) with a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Roche ) , followed with incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation at 12 , 000 ×g for 15 min at 4°C . The ﬁnal protein concentration of each sample was determined by a BCA kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . The protein expression level was detected by Western blotting analysis . The supernatants ( 20 μg total protein ) from protein lysates were subjected to SDS - PAGE gel according to standard procedures 10 in Bio - Rad system . Mouse anti - endophilin A2 antibody , rabbit anti - Caveolin - 1and rabbit anti - GAPDH were used as the primary antibody . The signal was further detected by using the secondary antibody of goat anti - rabbit IgG or goat anti - mouse IgG . The intensity of speciﬁc binding bands was calculated against the endogenous control ( GAPDH ) , and data were showed as fold change against the control . Statistical analysis Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± SEM . The statistical analysis of differences between experimental groups was performed using One - way ANOVA or Student ' s t - test . P value < 0 . 05 was considered significant . Results 1 . High expression of human ACE2 facilitates the infection of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses . In this study , SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses were used to investigate the virus infection . They contain the sequences of GFP and luciferase ( Figure 1A ) , so that successful infection can be easily quantiﬁed by detecting the fluorescence intensity of GFP or luminescent intensity of luciferase , even with minute amounts of pseudoviruses . It has been shown that SARS - CoV - 2 uses its spike protein binding ACE2 receptors to invade host cells [ 39 ] . We used SARS - CoV - 2 pseudoviruses to infect HEK293T cells and HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells . The luminescence intensity showing the luciferase activity was detected after 48 hours incubation . It was found that the SARS - CoV - 2 pseudoviruses only infected HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells and rarely entered to HEK293T cells ( Figure 1B and C ) . After incubation with pseudoviruses for 60 min , GFP expression could be observed in HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells and fluorescence intensity gradually increases with time . GFP expression was 11 observed in the whole cell at 12 h post - infection with the pseudoviruses ( Figure 1D ) . The percentage of infected cells ( with GFP expression ) were also analyzed , and the result showed that it increased from 63 % in 60 min to 91 % in 12 h ( Figure 1D ) . Figure . 1 SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus entering cells is ACE2 - dependent . ( A ) Schematic of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection and detection . GFP : green fluorescent protein ; IRES : internal ribosome entry site . ( B ) HEK293T ( n = 3 ) and HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells ( n = 3 ) were infected with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses at MOI of 10 . The unbound pseudoviruses were washed out at 4 h post - infection and the chemiluminescence was detected by a microplate reader at 48 h post - infection . ( C ) Fluorescence images are shown of HEK293T and HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells at 48 h post - infection ( MOI = 10 ) . Scale bar indicates 200 μm . ( D ) HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were continuously infected with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus ( MOI = 10 ) for 1 h , 1 . 5 h , 2 h , 4 h 12 and 12 h , and live cells were visualized by fluorescent microscopy to locate the GFP protein . Scale bar indicates 20 μm . Statistical data is presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments with repeated three times . * * * P < 0 . 001 . 2 . SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses are internalized through endocytosis sensitive to pH . The established view on the endocytic pathway of viruses is that it is pH - dependent and involve an activation step of the endocytosed virions in the acidic endosome . The SARS - CoV enter cells via endocytosis based on observations using ACE2 - GFP and chemical inhibitors for endosomal acidification [ 7 ] . To analyze the pathway of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection , lysosomotropic weak bases ( such as chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine and ammonium chloride ( NH 4 Cl ) ) and a v - ATPase inhibitor ( baﬁlomycin A1 ) were used to confirm that the viruses require low pH for infection [ 3 ] . All inhibitors used were tested on HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells by cytotoxicity assays to obtain the proper working concentration range ( Figure S1A - D ) . As shown in Figure 2A - D , pretreatment with different concentrations of inhibitors for endosomal acidification all significantly decreased viral infectivity in a dose - dependent manner . After incubation of HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells with pseudoviruses for 48 h , chloroquine ( 20 μM ) , hydroxychloroquine ( 20 μM ) , NH 4 Cl ( 50 mM ) and baﬁlomycin A1 ( 100 nM ) respectively caused 77 % ( Figure 2A ) , 73 % ( Figure 2B ) , 78 % ( Figure 2C ) and 99 % ( Figure 2D ) reduction in pseudovirus infection by detecting the luciferase luminescence value . We found that green fluorescence was seen in whole cells infected with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses , while the green fluorescence intensity in cells pretreated with different endosomal acidification inhibitors was significantly reduced at 12h post - infection with the pseudoviruses ( Figure 2E ) . These results demonstrate that the infection of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses is via endocytosis and pH - dependent . 13 Figure . 2 . Inhibition of endosomal acidification prevents SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection . ( A - D ) HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were pre - treated with different doses of chloroquine ( n = 3 ) ( A ) , hydroxychloroquine ( n = 3 ) ( B ) , NH 4 Cl ( n = 3 ) ( C ) and baﬁlomycin A1 ( n = 3 ) ( D ) then infected with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses at MOI of 10 . The pseudoviruses infectivity was analyzed by luciferase activity at 48 h post - infection . ( E ) Fluorescence pictures and brightfield are shown of control , chloroquine ( 20 μ M ) , hydroxychloroquine ( 20 μ M ) , NH 4 Cl ( 50 mM ) and baﬁlomycin A1 ( 100 nM ) at 12 h post - infection . Scale bar indicates 20 μm . Statistical data is presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments with repeated three times . * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 . 14 3 . Dynamin related endocytic pathways are not involved in SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection . CME , CaME , as well as FEME , are the most studied pathways to be involved in virus internalization [ 3 , 20 ] . To identify the speciﬁc endocytic pathway of SARS - CoV - 2 , siRNA and biochemical inhibitors targeting each endocytic pathway were used to evaluate the effect on SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection . Our results indicated that the clathrin - , caveolar - , and endophilin A2 - dependent pathway are not likely to be involved in the SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection . Chlorpromazine ( CPZ ) is a drug commonly used to inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis and prevent the assembly of clathrin coating pits on the cell surface [ 40 , 41 ] . We obtained the proper working concentration range of CPZ by cytotoxicity assays ( Figure S1E ) . Our result showed that CPZ pretreatment did not aﬀect the luciferase and fluorescence signal compared with vehicle control treated cells at 24 h and 48 h post - infection with the SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses , while infection of VSV - G pseudoviruses as a positive control was inhibited by CPZ pretreatment ( Figure 3A and B , Figure S2A ) . We also used RNAi method to explore the role of clathrin in SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection . Silencing of clathrin showed similar results in luciferase luminescence , compared with the results using clathrin inhibitors ( Figure 3C ) . Next we used a siRNA approach to explore the role of CaME in SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection . The silencing eﬃciency of cavelin - 1 ( CAV1 ) siRNA in HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells was detected by Western blotting ( Figure 3D ) . Silencing of CAV1 failed to show any significant effect on infection of spike - bearing pseudoviruses by monitoring the luminescence intensity of luciferase ( Figure 3D ) . We next investigated whether FEME was related to SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection by knocking down EA2 using its specific siRNA , and the silencing eﬃciency of 15 EA2 siRNA was also detected by Western blotting ( Figure 3E ) . In line with silencing of CAV1 , silencing of EA2 displayed no eﬀect on spike - bearing pseudovirus infection in HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells compared to the siNC control ( Figure 3E ) . This result probably suggested that EA2 might not contribute to the pseudovirus infection , however , we remain not to completely rule out the FEME pathway due to the compensation effect from the other endophilin isoforms . Dynamin is a cellular GTPase and plays an essential role in some modes of endocytosis , including CME , FEME , CaME as well as some of the non - clathrin / non - caveolin - dependent pathways [ 42 ] . Accordingly , viruses may use either dynamin - dependent or - independent modes of endocytosis or a combination of the two [ 43 ] . Our above results indicated that dynamin - related pathways are not likely to be involved in the entry of SARS - CoV - 2 . To double confirm our finding we used dynasore , an effective endocytic pathway inhibitor that could inhibit dynamin activity by rapidly blocking coated vesicle formation within seconds of dynasore addition [ 42 ] . The proper working concentration range of dynasore was obtained by cytotoxicity assays in HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells ( Figure S1F ) . Results showed that pretreatment of dynasore at different concentrations did not aﬀect SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infectivity by detection of luciferase luminescence at 48 h post - infection with the pseudoviruses ( Figure 3F and Figure S2B ) , while infection of VSV - G pseudoviruses as a positive control was inhibited by dynasore pretreatment . The representative fluorescence image also showed that dynasore had no significant effect on SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection ( Figure 3G ) . Knocking down of dynamin using siRNA showed similar results in luciferase luminescence compared with the results using dynasore ( Figure 3H ) . 16 Figure . 3 SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection of HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells is independent of dynamin , clathrin , caveolin , and endophilin A2 . ( A ) HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were pre - treated with CPZ ( 25 μ M ) ( n = 3 ) and infected with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses ( MOI = 10 ) or the control pseudoviruses VSV - G ( n = 3 ) . The infection was then measured by firefly luciferase activity at 48 h post - infection .

( G , H ) HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were pre - treated with dynasore ( 80 μ M ) ( n = 3 ) , and infected with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses ( MOI = 10 ) or the control pseudoviruses VSV - G ( n = 3 ) . The infection efficiency was evaluated as above mentioned . 17 ( H ) HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were transfected with si - Dynamin and then infected with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses ( MOI = 10 ) or VSV - G pseudoviruses ( MOI = 10 ) , and infectivity was measured by firefly luciferase activity at 48 h post - infection ( n = 3 ) . Scale bar indicates 200 μm . Statistical data is presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments with repeated three times . * * * P < 0 . 001 . 4 . SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses are internalized without involvement of macropinocytosis . Then we further investigated the dynamin - independent pathways in virus infection . Macropinosome formation requires a variety of cellular factors activity , such as Na + / H + exchange ( NHE ) , PKC , p21 - activated kinase 1 ( PAK1 ) and Rho GTPase ( CDC42 and RAC1 ) [ 24 , 44 , 45 ] . We assessed the role of macropinocytosis in SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection using 5 - ( N - ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amiloride ( EIPA , an inhibitor of NHE ) [ 46 ] , NSC 23766 trihydrochloride ( an inhibitor of RAC1 ) [ 47 ] , IPA - 3 ( an inhibitor of PAK1 ) [ 48 ] . All inhibitors used were tested on HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells by cytotoxicity assays to obtain the proper working concentration range ( Figure S1G - I ) . As shown in Figure 4A , EIPA pretreatment decreased SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infectivity , only when the concentration of EIPA reaches 80 μM . IPA - 3 pretreatment exhibited no statistically significant change on the percentage of pseudovirus infection efficiency ( Figure 4B ) . A dose - dependent increase of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection was observed in the presence of NSC 23766 trihydrochloride ( Figure 4C ) . The result of GFP observed under a fluorescence microscope to evaluate pseudovirus infection is similar to the result of luciferase luminescence ( Figure 4D ) . In summary , these results indicate that macropinocytosis is likely not involved in the mediation of the infection of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses . 18 Figure . 4 SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses infects cells independent with macropinocytosis . ( A - C ) HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were pre - treated with different concentrations of EIPA ( n = 3 ) ( A ) , IPA - 3 ( n = 3 ) ( B ) , and NSC 23766 trihydrochloride ( n = 3 ) ( C ) , and then infected with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses at MOI of 10 . The pseudoviruses infectivity was analyzed by firefly luciferase activity at 48 h post - infection . ( D ) Fluorescence images are shown of control , EIPA ( 80 μ M ) , IPA - 3 ( 20 μ M ) , and NSC 23766 trihydrochloride ( 40 μ M ) at 24 h post - infection with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses . Scale bar indicates 200 μm . Statistical data is presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments with repeated three times . * P < 0 . 05 . 19 5 . SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses invades host cells in dependence on cholesterol - rich lipid rafts . Cholesterol - rich lipid rafts have been found to play a crucial role in the interaction between the SARS - CoV S protein and ACE2 [ 34 , 49 ] . To investigate the involvement of cholesterol - rich lipid rafts during the initial steps of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , we used methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( MβCD ) to deplete cholesterol from HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells . The proper working concentration range of MβCD was obtained by cytotoxicity assays in HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells ( Figure S1J ) . MβCD , which captured cholesterol and thereby sequestered cholesterol from the plasma membrane , was able to block SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure . 5A and B ) . When the concentration of MβCD pretreatment reached 2 . 5 mM , the inhibition efficiency exceeded 96 % compared to vehicle control treatment cells at 48 h post - infection with the SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses . As negative control , the infection of VSV - G pseudoviruses was not affected by cholesterol depletion ( Figure 5A ) . HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were treated with 2 . 5 mM MβCD at diﬀerent time points and inoculated with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses for viral infection . As shown in Figure 5C , when MβCD was pre - treated to cells ( pre - 2 h , pre - 1 h , pre - 0 . 5 h , 0 h ) , pseudovirus infection was signiﬁcantly reduced by MβCD pretreatment ; whereas MβCD treatment at 1 h post infection had no effect on viral infection . This indicated that cholesterol mainly affected the process before the virus entered the cells . The infection and infection of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses could be restored by supplement of exogenous cholesterol . MβCD - treated HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells with exogenous cholesterol ( 100 μg / ml ) showed almost twice the total number of luciferase luminescence compared to cells treated with pseudoviruses only . ( Figure 5D and E ) . In addition , we also tested the effect of supplementing exogenous cholesterol on pseudovirus infection , 20 and found that different concentrations of cholesterol all increased pseudovirus infection ( Figure 5F ) . Hence , it demonstrates that the anti - SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection of MβCD is dependent on cholesterol depletion . The clathrin - independent carriers ( CLIC ) and GPI - anchored - protein - enriched endosomal compartments ( GEEC ) pathway is an important endocytic pathway for cholesterol - rich lipid raft components [ 14 , 50 ] . The CLIC / GEEC pathway has been demonstrated to be regulated by GRAF1 , CDC42 and Arf1 [ 51 - 53 ] . We tried to preliminarily assess the role of CLIC / GEEC pathway in SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection using MLL141 ( an inhibitor of CDC42 ) [ 54 , 55 ] . The MLL141 was tested on HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells by cytotoxicity assays to obtain the proper working concentration range ( Figure S1K ) . The result showed that MLL141 ( 10 μM ) pretreatment exhibited no statistically significant change on the pseudovirus infection ( Figure 5G ) , suggesting that CDC42 - involved CLIC / GEEC pathway probably might not participate in the infection of SARS - CoV - 2 . 21 Figure . 5 The infection of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses is cholesterol dependent . ( A ) HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells were pre - treated with MβCD at different concentrations ( n = 3 ) , and then infected with SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses ( MOI = 10 ) or the control pseudoviruses VSV - G ( n = 3 ) .

The infection was then measured by firefly luciferase activity at 24 h post - infection .

Figure . 6 Graphical summary of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection Discussion The SARS - CoV - 2 virus infection initiated with binding of viral particles to host surface ACE2 receptors , is a crucial step for eﬀective viral infection . Using SARS - CoV - 2 pseudoviruses we could show that cholesterol - rich membrane lipid raft plays a major role in the infection and not the classical 23 endocytosis pathways , such as clathrin - , caveolin - , endophilinA2 - mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis . SARS - CoV - 2 is a positive - stranded RNA virus belonging to the β coronavirus genus . The structure of this new coronavirus is mainly composed of single - stranded RNA , membrane ( M ) , nucleocapsid ( N ) , envelope ( E ) , and S proteins [ 56 ] . The N protein , one of the most abundant viral proteins , combines with viral genomic RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) complex [ 57 ] . It showed that N protein mainly involved in viral mRNA transcription and replication and cytoskeletal and immune regulation of host cells [ 58 ] . The M protein of SARS - CoV - 2 can inhibit IFN - β promoter activation and participate in evading host anti - viral immunity [ 59 ] . E protein relates to the virus pathogenicity and may activate the host ' s inflammatory response . In some coronaviruses , the E protein deletion will reduce the virus ' s toxicity [ 60 ] . S protein directly binds to the host cell membrane receptor to mediate SARS - CoV - 2 entry [ 61 ] . Pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility , and the pseudovirus expressing S - protein has been shown to be used to study the mechanism of SARS - CoV - 2 entry [ 5 , 62 , 63 ] and neutralization assays [ 64 ] . TMPRSS2 have been shown to cleave SARS - CoV - 2 S protein and enhance membrane fusion [ 6 , 65 ] . The camostat mesylate ( an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 ) can partially block SARS - CoV - 2 infection of the Caco - 2 cells ( TMPRSS2 + ) , while it did not interfere with SARS - CoV - 2 infection of the Vero and HEK293T cells ( TMPRSS2 − ) [ 5 , 65 , 66 ] . In contrast , the entry of SARS - CoV - 2 mainly depends on the endosomal pathway in Vero and HEK293T cells that do not express TMPRSS2 , and can be inhibited by E - 64d ( cathepsins B / L inhibitor ) [ 5 , 66 ] . Consistent with these findings , Zhu et al [ 6 ] showed that SARS - CoV - 2 entered cells via two pathways . One pathway was the membrane fusion pathway that relied on proteases ( e . g . , TMPRSS2 ) , and the other pathway was the endosomal pathway , 24 which is less efficient than the plasma membrane fusion pathway . In the present study , we focused on the cell endosomal pathways , which remained poorly understood by now , using the SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses and HEK293T cell line ( TMPRSS2 − ) as research tools . Previous studies have shown that SARS - CoV S protein and its interaction with the cell receptor ACE2 is essential for SARS - CoV entry and membrane fusion [ 67 , 68 ] . Recent studies also highlighted the important role of ACE2 in mediating the SARS - CoV - 2 entry [ 69 , 70 ] . Compared with SARS - CoV , the ACE2 receptor binding domain of SARS - CoV - 2 differs on several key amino acid residues which leads to a stronger binding affinity with receptor and may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 56 , 71 ] . In this study , we also confirmed the important role of ACE2 in SARS - CoV - 2 infection . The chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been demonstrated to inhibit SARS - CoV - 2 effectively in vitro [ 38 , 72 ] . Howerve , some subsequent studies have found that chloroquine targets the viral activation which is not actived in lung cells and is unlikely to prevent the infection of SARS - CoV - 2 in related patients , while the use of chloroquine was associated with an increased risk of denovo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation [ 73 , 74 ] . We found that NH 4 Cl and baﬁlomycin A1 also had inhibitory effect to SARS - CoV - 2 pseudovirus infection as chloroquine , and baﬁlomycin A1 had a better inhibitory effect than chloroquine in HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells . Our data provide additional information that inhibition of endosome acidification can be used for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 infections drug design . Lipid rafts represent foci for mediating signal transduction and protein trafficking and increasing evidence shows that lipid rafts are essential in the replication cycle of different viruses [ 29 , 75 ] . Biochemical fractionation and confocal imaging conﬁrmed that ACE2 colocalized with lipid raft 25 marker ganglioside monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 ( GM1 ) and upon cholesterol depletion by MβCD treatment inhibited infectivity of SARS - CoV pseudoviruses by 90 % [ 34 ] . Cholesterol depletion with MβCD inhibited the infectivity and the receptor binding ability of Newcastle disease virus ( NDV ) [ 76 ] . Cholesterol - rich lipid rafts are required for release of infectious human respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) [ 77 ] . Strong data also suggest that virus budding can occur within membrane lipid rafts [ 3 , 29 , 31 ] . It has been reported that the budding of HIV virions through lipid rafts whereby host cell cholesterol , sphingolipids , and GPI - linked proteins within these domains are incorporated into the viral envelope [ 78 ] . Host lipid rafts play a critical role in binding , endocytosis , assembly and budding of influenza A virus ( IAV ) [ 79 ] . Therefore , a role for cholesterol has attracted increasing attention for the understanding of the SARS - CoV - 2 infection process [ 62 , 80 , 81 ] . It has been reported that cholesterol 25‐hydroxylase ( CH25H ) inhibits SARS‐CoV‐2 and other coronaviruses by depleting membrane cholesterol in vitro and in COVID‐19‐infected patients [ 62 ] . Observational studies on COVID - 19 individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) showed that they increased the severity of the disease and mortality [ 82 ] . The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published the case series to date of COVID - 19 in mainland China ( 72 , 314 cases , updated through February 11 , 2020 ) , with an overall case - fatality rate ( CFR ) was 2 . 3 % . Importantly , the CFR with underlying CVD patients was the highest among those with preexisting comorbid conditions , increased to 10 . 5 % ( 7 . 3 % for diabetes , 6 . 3 % for chronic respiratory disease , 6 . 0 % for hypertension , and 5 . 6 % for cancer ) [ 83 ] . Statins are lipid - lowering therapeutics with favorable anti - inflammatory profiles and have been proposed as an adjunct therapy for COVID - 19 [ 84 , 85 ] . The retrospective study on 13 , 981 patients with COVID - 19 in Hubei Province , China , among which 1 , 219 received statins showed that the risk for 28 - day all - 26 cause mortality was 5 . 2 % and 9 . 4 % in the matched statin and non - statin groups respectively [ 84 ] . Combined with the results of this study , statins may inhibit SARS - CoV - 2 infections by lowering cholesterol . In this study , we proved that SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection are associated with cholesterol - rich lipid rafts . Meanwhile , we preliminarily studied the CLIC / GEEC pathway , which is an important lipid raft - related endocytic pathway . Adeno - associated virus 2 ( AAV2 ) infection had been shown to require endocytosis through the CLIC / GEEC pathway [ 86 ] . The infection of AAV2 is dependent on membrane cholesterol and can be blocked by inhibition of the three main effectors of CLIC / GEEC pathway , GRAF1 , CDC42 and Arf1 [ 86 ] . However , our result showed that inhibition of CDC42 had no effect on SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection . Therefore , it remains not clear how cholesterol - rich lipid raft regulates SARS - CoV - 2 binding or entry , which need to be studied further . In conclusion , the present study provides evidence that the infection of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses to HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells is via ACE2 receptor - dependent , pH - sensitive endocytosis and can be blocked by inhibitors for endosomal acidification . Moreover , classical endocytosis pathways , such as clathrin - , caveolin - , endophilinA2 - mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis are not involved in SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudovirus infection . Instead , cholesterol - rich membrane lipid raft may play a major role in the infection of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - bearing pseudoviruses to HEK293T - ACE2 hi cells ( Figure 6 ) .
