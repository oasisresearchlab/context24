Rich1 binds the scaffolding protein angiomotin ( Amot ) and is thereby targeted to a protein complex at tight junctions ( TJs ) containing the PDZ - domain proteins Pals1 , Patj , and Par - 3 . Regulation of Cdc42 by Rich1 is necessary for maintenance of TJs , and Rich1 is therefore an important mediator of this polarity complex . Furthermore , the coiled - coil domain of Amot , with which it binds Rich1 , is necessary for local - ization to apical membranes and is required for Amot to relocalize Pals1 and Par - 3 to internal puncta . We propose that Rich1 and Amot main - tain TJ integrity by the coordinate regulation of Cdc42 and by linking speciﬁc components of the TJ to intracellular protein trafﬁcking . INTRODUCTION Dynamic cellular organization depends on the selective in - teractions of signaling proteins . These interactions are commonly mediated by speciﬁc protein domains and are frequently controlled by protein phosphorylation and GTPases that toggle between active and inactive con - formations . Thesesimpledevicescanbeexploitedtobuild multiprotein networks that yield complex properties , such as cell polarity . Here , we explore a novel protein complex that is integrated with the mammalian epithelial polarity network and inﬂuences the activity of the Cdc42 GTPase , the formation of tight junctions ( TJs ) , and cell morphology . The plasma membrane of epithelial cells is asymmetri - cally organized into apical and basolateral regions , which have distinct protein and lipid compositions and are sep - arated in vertebrates by a dense network of protein strands mainly composed of claudins and occludins . These apical strands encircle the cell and make lateral contact with neighboring cells , thus forming the TJ , which provides a paracellular barrier to the movement of ions ( Yeaman et al . , 1999 ) . Recent data have identiﬁed a conserved series of pro - tein complexes that control cell polarity in metazoans . In epithelial cells , these complexes are spatially segregated alongtheapical - basolateral axisandimpartdiscreteprop - erties to separate regions of the cell . Distinct complexes also interact with one another , either to promote an aspect of polarity or to restrict the actions of polarity proteins to particular domains of the cell . The protein - protein interac - tions in this polarity network are typically mediated by PDZ domains and are regulated by serine / threonine phosphor - ylation and Rho - family GTPases . This is exempliﬁed by two dynamic protein assemblies , the Crumbs and Par - 3 complexes , which are important for establishing and maintaining apical junctions and deﬁning apical identity ( Macara , 2004 ; Roh and Margolis , 2003 ) . Mammalian Crumbs3 is an apically localized transmem - brane protein that binds through a C - terminal motif to the PDZ domain of Pals1 ( a MAGUK protein ) or Patj ( a protein with ten PDZ domains ) ( Roh and Margolis , 2003 ) . Patj and Pals1 also interact directly through heterodimerization of their N - terminal L27 domains ( Roh et al . , 2002 ) . Mamma - lian Patj also binds the TJ components ZO - 3 and claudin through its PDZ domains and can thereby be recruited into the TJ complex . In mammalian epithelia , Pals1 ( Straight et al . , 2004 ) , Patj ( Shin et al . , 2005 ) , and Crumbs3 ( Roh et al . , 2003 ) are all necessary for proper TJ integrity . The Par - 3 complex is located subapically . Par - 3 itself contains three PDZ domains , through which it associates with the PDZ domain of Par - 6 ( Joberty et al . , 2000 ; Lin et al . , 2000 ) and the C termini of the adhesion proteins Jam - 1 ( Ebnet et al . , 2001 ) or Nectin ( Takekuni et al . , 2003 ) . Par - 6 recruits both the atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) l and the GTP bound form of Cdc42 ( Joberty et al . , 2000 ; Cell 125 , 535 – 548 , May 5 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . 535 Lin et al . , 2000 ) , which stabilizes a functional conformation of the Par - 6 PDZ domain ( Garrard et al . , 2003 ) . In mamma - lian cells , Pals1 provides a direct link between the Crumbs and Par - 6 / Par - 3 complexes ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . Cdc42 is a member of the Rho GTPase family , whose members interact with effectors when bound to GTP and terminate signaling upon GTP hydrolysis . Cdc42 signaling is therefore enhanced by guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) that stimulate nucleotide release and consequent GTP binding and is inhibited by GTPase - activating pro - teins ( GAPs ) that promote nucleotide hydrolysis ( Nobes and Hall , 1994 ) . Cdc42 and proteins that regulate its GTPase cycle potentially act early in establishing cell po - larity . Cdc42 was ﬁrst identiﬁed in yeast as a mutant allele that disrupts bud formation and polarized distribution of the actin cytoskeleton ( Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ) . In Dro - sophila , expression of constitutively active ( CA ) or domi - nant - negative ( DN ) Cdc42 mutants after cellularization causes defects in epithelialization and a loss of polarity ( Hutterer et al . , 2004 ) . Similarly , overexpression of either CA or DN Cdc42 in mammalian MDCK epithelial cells dis - rupts polarity by inducing increased paracellular perme - ability and mixing of apical and basolateral components , consistent with a disruption of TJs ( Rojas et al . , 2001 ) . Because Cdc42 participates in a wide variety of cellular processes , including cell division , microtubule orientation , actinreorganization , andproteintrafﬁcking ( Johnson , 1999 ) , itisdifﬁculttodelineatethepreciseroleofCdc42inepithe - lial polarity using approaches that impact global Cdc42 signaling . Furthermore , Cdc42 belongs to a subset of Rho GTPases that potentially have overlapping functions ( Czuchra et al . , 2005 ) . One approach to this conundrum in - volves analysis of the GEFs and GAPs that regulate Cdc42 activity . Rho - family GEFs and GAPs are more numerous than the GTPases themselves and typically contain inter - action domains through which theyare directed to speciﬁc subcellular locations and may recruit upstream regulators , downstream targets , and cytoplasmic scaffolds ( Peck et al . , 2002 ; Rossman et al . , 2005 ) . As a consequence , speciﬁc Rho GEFs and GAPs may each target a discrete subpopulation of Cdc42 that undertakes a specialized function . We therefore reasoned that we could probe Cdc42 function at TJs by studying its local regulators . In a systematic screen of RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs , we identiﬁed a Cdc42 - selective GAP , Rich1 , that localizes to TJs and adherens junctions ( AJs ) , associates with com - ponents of the apical - polarity network , and maintains the integrity of TJs in epithelial cells through its regulation of Cdc42 . By examining the binding partners of proteins thatassociatewithRich1 , wedeﬁneaseriesofoverlapping polarity complexes that regulate the maintenance of TJs . RESULTS Rich1 Is a GAP for Cdc42 that Associates with Tight Junctions in Epithelial Cells To identify modulators of Cdc42 , we transiently expressed > 50 putative mammalian RhoGEFs and 50 RhoGAPS in HEK293T and / or NIH 3T3 cells and measured their intracel - lular speciﬁcity for RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 using ﬂuores - cence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) based probes ( data not shown ) . Proteins that altered the GTPase cycle of Cdc42 were analyzed in parallel for binding to known po - larity proteins by stably expressing each RhoGEF or Rho - GAP in a HEK293T - derived ( Phoenix ) cell line and analyzing theircoprecipitatingproteinsbytandemmassspectrometry ( MS / MS ) . Together , these assays identiﬁed Rich1 as a Cdc42GAPthatassociateswithapicalpolaritycomponents ( Figure 1 ) . We analyzed Rich1 GAP activity in epithelial cells by two approaches . Using Raichu FRET probes ( Itoh et al . , 2002 ; Yoshizaki et al . , 2003 ) , full - length ( FL ) Rich1 reduced the fraction of Cdc42 bound to GTP in 293T cells but had no measurable effect on Rac1 or RhoA ( Figure 1A ) . We also analyzed the effects of Rich1 on endogenous levels of GTP bound Cdc42 and Rac1 in MDCK cells by precipita - tion with the GTPase binding domain ( GBD ) of the Pak kinase . For this purpose , we used clonal MDCK cells that stably overexpressed wild - type ( wt ) Rich1 , a GAP - deﬁ - cientmutantofRich1 ( R288A ) , oracontrolline . wtRich1re - duced the levels of Cdc42 GTP by over 70 % with no effect on Rac1 . The GAP - deﬁcient mutant of Rich1 modestly el - evated Cdc42 - GTP with no signiﬁcant effect on the level of Rac1 - GTP ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . Taken together , Rich1 has selective GAP activity toward Cdc42 in epithelial cells . Rich1 ( also termed Nadrin ) contains an N - terminal BAR domain ( Richnau et al . , 2004 ) , a RhoGAP domain , and an (cid:1) 300 amino acid C - terminal tail with multiple proline - rich motifs capable of binding SH3 domains ( Richnau and As - penstrom , 2001 ) ( see below ; see also Figure S6A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . To identify endogenous proteins that associate with Rich1 in epithelial cells , we constructed three clonal cell lines in which Rich1 , containing an N - terminal triple - Flag epi - tope ( Flag - Rich1 ) , was stably expressed at low , medium , and high levels ( data not shown ) . Lysates from these three lines were combined and then immunoprecipitated to capture Rich1 and associated proteins , which were iden - tiﬁed through peptide sequencing by MS / MS ( Figure 1D ) . This analysis showed that Rich1 associates with polarity proteins . The most abundant Rich1 - associated protein migrated at 85 kDa and yielded 31 peptides matching 46 % of the sequence for Amot . This isoform of Amot has an N - terminal coiled - coil structure and a predicted C - terminal PDZ - domain binding motif . In addition , the po - larity protein Pals1 and its binding partner Patj were iden - tiﬁed ( Figure 1D and Table S1 ) . These interactions appear speciﬁc , as we did not see these proteins associate with other RhoGAPs such as chimerin ( Table S1 ) . Because Pals1 and Patj are interconnected with the Par - 3 / Par - 6 / aPKC complex , we tested whether these latter proteins also coprecipitate with Flag - Rich1 . Immunoblotting re - vealed aPKC and the 100 kDa isoform of Par - 3 , but not Par - 6 , in Rich1 immunoprecipitates ( Figure 1E ) . Par - 3 and aPKC likely associate with Rich1 at lower levels than Pals1 and Patj since they were not identiﬁed by MS . 536 Cell 125 , 535 – 548 , May 5 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . We also found endocytic proteins associated with Rich1 . These included the adaptors CIN85 and CD2AP , which directly bind each other and target the EGF ( Sou - beyran et al . , 2002 ) and HGF ( Petrelli et al . , 2002 ) recep - tors for endocytosis , as well as the actin capping proteins CAPZ a and CAPZ b , known binding partners of CD2AP ( Hutchings et al . , 2003 ) ( Figure 1D and Table S1 ) . Since Rich1 interacts with polarity proteins that associ - ate with TJs , we examined Rich1 localization in polarized MDCK cells using an antibody raised against Rich1 . This revealed that endogenous Rich1 associates with mem - branes ( Figure S1A ) and concentrates at sites of cell - cell contact , as well as showing a diffuse intracellular punctate stain ( Figure 2A , top panel ) . The antibody is speciﬁc since Rich1 immunoblotting and immunoﬂuorescence were re - duced in Rich1 - silenced MDCK cells ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Analysis of endogenous Rich1 staining along the apical - basolateral axis of wt MDCK cells revealed a con - centration of Rich1 that overlapped with the basal parts of ZO - 1 and with E - cadherin and b - Catenin ( Figures 2A Figure 1 .

Thus , Rich1 codistri - butes with markers for both the TJ and AJ . The GAP Activity of Rich1 Is Required for Proper TJ Maintenance Since Rich1 is a Cdc42 GAP that localizes to the TJ and AJ , we addressed the effects of reducing or increasing its expression on TJ integrity in MDCK cells . Clonal cell lines stably expressing wt Flag - Rich1 , or a mutant of Rich1 lacking the N - terminal 240 amino acids comprising the BAR domain ( D BAR ) , displayed a morphology indis - tinguishable from the parental MDCK cells ( data not shown ) . However , MDCK cells stably expressing a GAP - deﬁcient mutant of Rich1 ( R288A ) grew slowly and had a de - epithelialized morphology , interspersed with patches of cells with identiﬁable TJs , as revealed by ZO - 1 staining ( Figure 2C ) . To quantitatively assess the in - tegrity of TJs , we measured the transepithelial electrical resistance ( TER ) of wt MDCK cells , MDCK cells stably overexpressing wt Flag - Rich1 , Flag - Rich1 D BAR ( data not shown ) , or Flag - Rich1 ( R288A ) . All had TER in excess of 300 ohms 3 cm 2 2 days after plating ( Figure 2D ) , ex - cept monolayers of cells expressing the R288A GAP - de - ﬁcient mutant , which had no appreciable resistance even after culturing for 5 days ( Figure 2D ) . The slower growth rate of the MDCK R288A cells does not account for their inability to form TER since they still failed to de - velop any resistance when plated at a higher density ( data not shown ) . To assess the speciﬁcity of the defects on TJs induced by Rich1 R288A , we also constructed sta - ble MDCK lines that expressed a distinct Cdc42 - speciﬁc RhoGAP , chimerin , or a mutant of chimerin ( R304A ) pre - dicted to lack GAP activity . Both of these lines developed TER similar to wt MDCK cells ( data not shown ) , and their TJs appeared normal by ZO - 1 localization ( Figure S2G ) . To directly assess the involvement of Rich1 in TJ devel - opment and maintenance , we isolated two clonal MDCK cell lines ( 2A - 6 and 2A - 7 ) that stably express short hairpin ( sh ) RNAi to Rich1 and have a reduction in Rich1 expres - sion of at least 60 % and 90 % , respectively ( Figure 2E inset box ; Figure S2A ) . Signiﬁcantly , the 2A - 7 line failed to form monolayers with any measurable TER ( Figure 2E ) . The loss of TJ integrity correlated with the degree of Rich1 silencing since the 2A - 6 line formed monolayers that developed TER , albeit more slowly than wt MDCK cells ( Figure 2E ) . Since the defects in TJ structures in Rich1 - deﬁcient MDCK cells could reﬂect alterations in the formation , sta - bility , and / or turnover of TJs , we examined the effects of calcium removal in monolayers of 2A - 6 cells . The TER of 2A - 6 MDCK cells declined more rapidly than for wt cells following chelation of calcium ( Figure 2F ) , suggesting that Rich1 is important for maintaining the stability of TJs . To gauge whether the defects observed in MDCK 2A - 7 cells silenced for Rich1 correlated with improper localiza - tion of TJ proteins , these cells were ﬁxed and stained 48 hr after platingwithantibodies totheTJproteins ZO - 1 , Par - 3 , and Pals1 and the AJ protein E - cadherin . All the TJ markers were mislocalized in 2A - 7 cells . En face images showed ZO - 1 , Par - 3 , and Pals1 at fragmented spots and in circular structures in the 2A - 7 ( Figure 2G ; Figures S2C and S2D ) and R288A ( data not shown ) cell lines as op - posed to their localization at cell - cell contacts in wt MDCK cells . Further analysis of ZO - 1 staining along the apical - basolateral axis revealed that these circular struc - tures extended into the basal regions of the cell ( Figure S2F ) . Consistent with Rich1’s functioning in the maintenance of TJs , we found that Par - 3 was partially localized to cell - cell contacts in the MDCK 2A - 7 cell line 12 hr after plating but was increasingly mislocalized by 24 and 36 hr ( Figure S2H ) . Furthermore , the overall mor - phology of these cells became somewhat ﬁbroblastic at these later times ( Figure S2I ) . In contrast , E - cadherin lo - calized normally in both the R288A ( data not shown ) and 2A - 7 cell lines ( Figure 2H ) , indicating a selective loss of TJs . Since overexpressing the R288A mutant of Rich1 gave a phenotype similar to silencing Rich1 expression , we surmise that this construct behaves in a dominant - negative manner and that proper regulation of Cdc42 or closely related GTPases by Rich1 is important for TJ integrity . An Iterative Approach to Analyzing Rich1 - Containing Signaling Complexes To pursue how Rich1 is integrated into the network of TJ proteins , we used MS / MS to identify further binding part - ners for Rich1 - associated proteins , including Amot and Par - 3 . To this end , we stably expressed human Amot ( KIAA1071 ) ( with an N - terminal triple Flag epitope ) in 293T cells , followed by immunoprecipitation with anti - Flag antibodies . Endogenous Par - 3 and associated pro - teins were immunoprecipitated from rat brain lysates . Im - munoprecipitates of Amot ( Figure 3A ; Table S1 ) contained peptides for Rich1 , Pals1 , and Patj , providing additional evidence that these four proteins interact in a single com - plex . Amot also coprecipitated with several proteins that werenotdetectedinRich1complexes , includingaMAGUK protein ( membrane protein , palmitoylated 7 ; MPP7 ) , the multiple PDZ - domain protein ( MUPP1 ) , Amot - like 1 ( AMOTL1 , also termed junctionally enriched protein , or JEAP ) ( Nishimura et al . , 2002 ) , and Amot - like 2 ( AMOTL2 , also termed MASCOT ) ( Patrie , 2005 ) ( Figure 3A ; Table S1 ) . These data suggest that Amot is a component of at least two complexes , only one of which contains Rich1 . To verify association of endogenous Rich1 , Amot , and Par - 3 , we examined immunoprecipitations from lysates prepared from tissue culture or rat brains by immunoblot or MS analysis . Endogenous Rich1 coprecipitated with Amot from both 293T ( Figure 3B ) and rat brain ( data not ( G ) ZO - 1 staining in wt MDCK cells ( left panel ) and Rich1 shRNAi ( clone 2A - 7 ) MDCK cells ( right panel ) .

Nuclei in ( A ) , ( B ) , ( C ) , ( G ) , and ( H ) are stained blue with Hoechst dye . Cell 125 , 535 – 548 , May 5 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . 539 shown ) lysates . Furthermore , Amot was detected in an immunoprecipitation of Par - 3 from rat brain lysate ( Fig - ure 3B ) , and analysis of a Par - 3 immunoprecipitate from rat brain lysates by MS / MS detected two peptides match - ing sequences in Rich1 , conﬁrming that Rich1 , Amot , and Par - 3 associate in vivo ( Table S1 ) . These data indicate that Rich1 , Amot , Pals1 , Patj , and Par - 3 form a speciﬁc com - plex in epithelial cells but can also contribute to other complexes with distinct components ( Figure 3C ) . The PDZ - Domain Binding Motif of Amot Interacts with Patj and Targets Amot to Tight Junctions Sequence analysis has predicted two Amot isoforms that differ in the extent of their N termini ( Moreau et al . , 2005 ) . Indeed , rabbit polyclonal antibodies to angiomotin de - tected two bands of (cid:1) 130 kDa and 85 kDa in 293T cells ( Figure 4A ) and rodent brain ( data not shown ) , consistent with the expression of both Amot isoforms . In MDCK cells , however , the 85 kDa isoform was more abundant ( Figure 4A ) . Amot has a potential PDZ binding motif ( EYLI ) at its C terminus ( Figure S6A ) , which might recruit proteins such as Pals1 and Patj . Indeed , YFP - Amot separately precipi - tated Flag - Pals1 and Myc - Patj in 293T cells , whereas a mutant of Amot lacking the C - terminal 5 residues ( D C - term ) did not precipitate either protein ( Figure 4B ) . While these data suggest that Amot interacts with the Pals1 - Patj complex via its PDZ binding motif , they do not identify the primary binding partner for Amot because the L27 domains of Pals1 and Patj can heterodimerize ( Roh et al . , 2002 ) . We therefore examined whether Amot could bind mutants of Patj or Pals1 that lack L27 domains ( Patj 3 - 10PDZ or Pals1 PDZ , respectively ) and consequently do not associate with each other . Because Amot bound Patj 3 - 10PDZ ( Figure 4C ) but not Pals1 PDZ ( Figure S5 ) , it is likely that the C - terminal motif of Amot interacts with one of the eight C - terminal PDZ domains of Patj and that Patj recruits Pals1 to Amot . These results indicate that Amot might colocalize with the Pals1 / Patj complex in polarized epithelial cells through its C terminus . We therefore examined the distribution of stably expressed YFP - Amot 85 kDa or YFP - Amot 85 kDa D C - term in MDCK cells . In addition to a diffuse distribu - tion , YFP - Amot 85 kDa was enriched at regions of cell - cell contact where it colocalized with endogenous Par - 3 , ZO - 1 , and Pals1 ( Figures 4D and 4F ; Figure S4A ) ; in Figure 3 .

Fur - ther , deconvoluted Z stack images showed YFP - Amot 85 kDa codistributed to apical surfaces of MDCK cells with endogenous Patj ( Figure 4G ) . We therefore propose that the PDZ binding motif at the C terminus of Amot binds Patj and that this is necessary for Amot to localize to TJs . To determine the localization of endogenous Amot , we stained polarized MDCK cells with Amot antibody . Amot was seen at cell - cell contacts and partially colocalized with ZO - 1 ( Figure 5A ) , as has been recently reported in en - dothelial cells ( Bratt et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , Amot was seen in regions below the TJ , coincident with the AJ pro - tein E - cadherin ( Figure 5B ) . This extended basal staining of endogenous Amot , which is not seen with the exoge - nous 85 kDa isoform ( Figure 4G ; Figures S4G and S4H ) , may represent the 130 kDa Amot isoform , which contains an N - terminal extension that can bind the AJ protein Magi - 1b ( Bratt et al . , 2005 ; Dobrosotskaya and James , 2000 ) . Amot Relocalizes to Cell - Cell Contacts following TJ Formation To determine whether Amot might function in the forma - tion or maintenance of TJs , we imaged its localization in MDCK cells following an overnight Ca 2 + switch . Unlike ZO - 1 , which was localized to the TJ within 2 – 4 hr , Amot did not completely regain TJ staining until 4 to 24 hr follow - ing the readdition of Ca 2 + . Since Amot relocalizes to the TJ later than ZO - 1 or Patj , which has been reported to appear at the TJ within 3 hr following a Ca 2 + switch ( Shin et al . , 2005 ) , Amot is not likely to play a role in the initial formation of TJs ( Figure 5C ) .

Because BAR domains are also composed of CC regions of similar length , we modeled this region onto the BAR domain of amphiphysin ; this revealed a striking conservation of pos - itively charged residues that in amphiphysin reside on the concave lipid binding surface ( Figure S3A ) . We therefore speculated that the N - terminal CC region of Amot func - tions as a BAR domain ( and will subsequently refer to it as the BAR / CC domain ) . Based on reports that BAR domains can homo - or het - erodimerize ( Navarro et al . , 1997 ) , we considered that Amot might directly bind Rich1 and thereby target it to TJ . Coexpression of FL Rich1 and FL Amot in 293T cells resulted in the formation of a complex , as detected by immunoprecipitation of either protein . However , removal of the BAR / CC domain from either Rich1 or Amot greatly reduced this interaction ( Figure 6A ) . Furthermore , the BAR domain of Rich1 alone efﬁciently bound FL Amot but only weakly recognized a mutant of Amot that lacks the BAR / CC domain ( D BAR / CC ) ( Figure 6B ) . Similarly , the BAR / CC domain of Amot coprecipitated wt Rich1 , and this interaction was compromised by deletion of the Rich1 BAR domain ( Figure 6B ) . This indicates that the BAR / CC domains of Rich1 and Amot are necessary and sufﬁcient for these proteins to efﬁciently associate in cells . To test whether the BAR / CC domains of Rich1 and / or Amot are required for their localization to membranes and / or TJs , we compared the intracellular localization of FL Rich1 and FL Amot to that of D BAR Rich1 and D BAR / CCAmotinMDCKcells . Asnotedabove , stablyexpressed FL Flag - Rich1 was concentrated in small punctate struc - tures and at cell - cell contacts with Par - 3 ( Figure 6C ) ; Amot 85 kDa expressed stably at low levels or transiently ( Figures 4D and 4F ; Figure S4E ) also localized to TJ and to apical membranes . In contrast , mutants of Rich1 ( Figure 6D ) or Amot ( Figures 6E and 6F ) lacking a BAR / CC domain had a diffuse staining pattern . For Rich1 , this represents a shift from the membrane to the cytosol ( Fig - ure S3B ) , whereas for Amot , which has been reported to encode a second membrane targeting region ( Bratt et al . , 2005 ) , there was a loss of staining at cell - cell contacts andapicalmembranes ( Figures6Eand6F ) butnoapparent increase in cytosolic localization ( Figure S3B ) . Interest - ingly , the isolated BAR / CC domain of Amot was highly concentrated in a band at the same apical position as Par - 3 ( Figure 6G ) . These data show that the BAR / CC re - gions of Rich1 and Amot are necessary for heterotypic binding and for targeting within the cell . Overexpression of Amot Induces a Relocalization of Polarity Proteins and Loss of Transepithelial Electrical Resistance in MDCK Cells The association of Amot with Rich1 and the Pals1 / Patj complex suggests a role in epithelial polarity ; we therefore investigated the effects of overexpressing or reducing Amot on polarity in MDCK cells . Cells stably overexpress - ing YFP Amot 85 kDa failed to develop any detectable TER 30 hr following a calcium switch , unlike wt MDCK cells or cells expressing YFP - Amot 85 kDa D C - term , which regained all or 60 % of their original TER , respectively ( Figure 7A ) . The inability of MDCK cells stably expressing wt Amot to form TER is likely explained by the selective relocalization of endogenous TJ components such as Par - 3 ( Figure 7B ) Figure 5 . Amot Localizes to Regions of Cell - Cell Contact after TJ Formation ( A and B ) . Enface images of wt MDCK cells immunostained for Amot ( left panels ) and either ZO - 1 ( middle panels , [ A ] ) or E - cadherin ( middle panels , [ B ] ) .

Such relocalization only occurs in cells in which Amot is highly expressed ( Figure 7B ) , sug - gesting that Amot levels must cross a certain threshold to induce internalization of speciﬁc TJ components . The localization of ZO - 1 to cell - cell contacts was moderately disrupted in such cells , but , since it was not redistributed into puncta with Amot ( Figure S4B ) , this may be a second - ary defect due to the loss of Pals1 and Par - 3 from TJs . Re - cent data suggest that endocytosis of proteins at the TJ and subsequent trafﬁcking through differential endosomal populations is important for maintaining cellular polarity ( Ivanov et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , overexpressed YFP - Amot D C - term did not recruit TJ components into such structures or disrupt their localization to cell - cell contacts , consistent with the inability of this mutant to disrupt TER ( Figures 7A and 7C ; Figure S4C ) . Taken together , Amot connects to polarity proteins through its PDZ binding site and also requires this motif to promote the internaliza - tion of proteins at TJs and induce a loss of TJ integrity . Since a high level of overexpressed Amot recruits com - ponents of TJs into internal puncta , reminiscent of the ef - fects of Ca 2 + depletion on Patj redistribution ( Shin et al . , 2005 ) , we addressed whether Amot was involved in this latter process by generating an MDCK cell line ( Ang A - 4 ) inwhichAmotexpression ispartiallysilenced ( Figure7Fin - set box ) . Upon calcium depletion , there was a delay in the loss of TJ integrity as monitored by TER in the MDCK AngA - 4 cells compared with wt MDCK cells . Amot Modulates the Activity of Rich1 Because depletion of Rich1 and overexpression of Amot have the same effects on TJs , we hypothesized that over - expression of Amot may prevent Rich1 from appropriately regulating the Cdc42 GTPase . We explored this possibil - ity using the Cdc42 - Raichu FRET reporter in 293T cells . Indeed , Amot overexpression suppressed the ability of Rich1 to reduce the fraction of Cdc42 bound to GTP , whereas the related Amot L1 had no effect on Rich1 GAP activity ( Figure 7G ) . These data suggest that the phe - notypes observed upon overexpression of Amot may in part be explained by an inhibition of Rich1 GAP activity . DISCUSSION The GTPase - Accelerating Activity of Rich1 for Cdc42 Underlies Its Role in TJ Integrity We have identiﬁed a Cdc42 - selective GAP , Rich1 , as be - ing important for the integrity of TJs in epithelial cells .

A similar phenotype is induced by overexpression of a GAP - deﬁcient mutant of Rich1 , arguing that the ability of Rich1 to regulate Cdc42 is important to its role in polarity . Cdc42 has a conserved role in maintaining the apical - basolateral polarity of epithelial cells , which has been prin - cipally explored using CA or DN Cdc42 mutants . Of the two , CA Cdc42 has a greater impact on apical polarity in Figure 7 .

( H ) A depiction of the domain architectures and proposed functional interactions of Rich1 , Amot , Pals1 , Patj , and Cdc42 . 544 Cell 125 , 535 – 548 , May 5 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . cultured MDCK cells ( Kroschewski et al . , 1999 ) and spe - ciﬁcally inhibits polarity in chick somites ( Nakaya et al . , 2004 ) . Overexpression of CA Cdc42 and inactivation of Rich1 produce comparable phenotypes , including a redis - tribution of similar TJ components but the sparing of AJs ( Bruewer et al . , 2004 ) , arguing that both manipulations dis - rupt polarity through the aberrant production of GTP bound Cdc42 . Ectopic Cdc42 - GTP could simply activate targets that are toxic to TJs ; alternatively , it could interfere with cycling of Cdc42 between GDP and GTP bound states and thereby block the ability of Cdc42 to regulate TJ compo - nents . In favor of the latter possibility , cycling of Cdc42 has been established as necessary for polarity in Saccha - romyces cerevisiae ( Irazoqui et al . , 2003 ) and is suggested by experiments in ﬂies ( Hutterer et al . , 2004 ) , MDCK cells ( Bruewer et al . , 2004 ) , and chick somites ( Nakaya et al . , 2004 ) . Rich1 may therefore prevent a stable pool of Cdc42 - GTP from forming at TJs and / or AJs of mammalian epithelial cells and thereby promote Cdc42 cycling . ThesubstrateselectivityofFLRich1forCdc42observed in MDCK and HEK293T epithelial cells is consistent with studies in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Parsons et al . , 2005 ) . The GAP domain of Rich1 alone , however , exhibits activity for both Cdc42 and Rac1 in a pig aortic endothelial ( PAE ) cell line ( Richnau and Aspenstrom , 2001 ) . Although our as - says may have lacked the sensitivity to detect activity to - ward a less optimal substrate , it is also possible that FL Rich1 is speciﬁc for Cdc42 or has context - dependent speciﬁcity , asdocumentedforotherRhoGAPs ( Minoshima et al . , 2003 ) . Inactivation of Rich1 signaling in MDCK cells caused a severe mislocalization of ZO - 1 , similar to CA Cdc42 but distinct from CA Rac1 , which produces modest ( Jou et al . , 1998 ) or undetectable effects on ZO - 1 localiza - tion at TJs ( Bruewer et al . , 2004 ) , consistent with a primary effect on Cdc42 or related GTPases ( Czuchra et al . , 2005 ) . Rich1 and Amot Are Novel and Functional Components of Pals1 - and Patj - Containing Polarity Complexes A proteomic screen for Rich1 binding partners converged with a similar analysis of apical - polarity proteins , revealing a series of reciprocal interactions involving Rich1 and Amot , the Patj / Pals1 polarity complex , and Par - 3 , all of which colocalize to the same region of the TJ in polarized MDCK cells . It appears that these proteins are compo - nents of an extensive and potentially dynamic network of interacting complexes ( Figure 7H ) . Our data indicate that Amot is a scaffold that recognizes Patj through its C - terminal PDZ binding motif and also binds Rich1 throughamutual BAR - domain / CC interaction . Thus , Amot links Rich1 to Patj and may thereby target Rich1 to a sub - population of Cdc42 involved in maintaining TJ structures . In this regard , mutants of Rich1 or Amot lacking their N - terminal BAR / CC domains are diffusely dispersed . In contrast , variants of Amot containing the BAR / CC domain but lacking the PDZ binding motif are retained at the apical membrane but are not targeted to TJs . These data sug - gest a model in which the BAR / CC domains of Rich1 and Amot mediate their joint interaction and recruitment to apical membranes . Amot is then further localized to TJs through association of its C - terminal PDZ binding motif with Patj . Rich1 and Amot Function Primarily by Maintaining Tight Junctions Recent data indicate that Patj and Pals1 are necessary for apical polarity and that Crumbs3 signaling in MCF10A cells is sufﬁcient to recruit Pals1 and Patj to the apical do - main and induce competent TJs ( Fogg et al . , 2005 ) . Pals1 / Patj may function in this context to localize Par - 6 or to recruit aPKC to the TJ . However , the loss of Pals1 , Patj , or Crumbs3 may also uncouple the Amot / Rich1 complex from TJs , which in turn could deregulate Cdc42 signaling necessary for epithelial polarity . Amot localizes to TJs following a Ca 2 + switch , later than the retargeting of ZO - 1 or Patj ( Shin et al . , 2005 ) . This sug - geststhatAmotisnotessentialforTJformation . Rich1also appears to contribute to TJ stability , as MDCK cells par - tiallysilencedforRich1areabnormallysensitivetoalossof TJintegrityuponCa 2 + depletion , whilecellshighlysilenced for Rich1 ( 2A - 7 cells ) form islands of cells with intact TJs , interspersed among depolarized cells , although these TJs degradeovertime ( Figure S2H ) . These resultssuggestthat Amot and Rich1 are not absolutely necessary for the for - mation of TJs but are required for their long - term stability . A Role for Amot and Rich1 in Regulating the Uptake of Polarity Proteins at Tight Junctions How do Amot and Rich1 function , in a mechanistic sense , to maintain TJs ? A possible answer is suggested by the selective internalization of Pals1 and Par - 3 as well as the concomitant loss of the TJ permeability barrier upon Amot overexpression . The idea that polarity is maintained by selective endocytosis of polarity proteins is supported by recent work showing that defects in the uptake of Dro - sophila Crumbs , which associates with Pals1 and Patj ( Roh et al . , 2002 ; Tepass and Knust , 1993 ) , leads to an expanded apical domain and tumor formation ( Lu and Bilder , 2005 ) . The uptake of Crumbs may therefore main - tain polarity by preventing excess activity from this apical complex . Two elements within Amot appear important for the regulation of polarity components . The Amot BAR / CC domain is necessary for the formation of Amot - containing puncta , and the C - terminal PDZ binding motif , which recruits the polarity protein Patj , is required for targeting of TJ components into such internal structures . The requirement for the Amot BAR / CC domain may re - ﬂect its involvement in localizing Amot to apical mem - branes and junctions . Since the BAR domains of proteins such as amphiphysin and endophilin directly regulate vesicle formation by binding and / or bending curved mem - branes ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) , it will be of interest to know whether the interacting BAR / CC domains from Amot and Rich1 can modify membranes in a similar fashion . In addi - tion , the ability of the Amot BAR domain to recruit Rich1 Cell 125 , 535 – 548 , May 5 , 2006 ª 2006 Elsevier Inc . 545 may impact on trafﬁcking of TJ components through the association of Rich1 with the endocytic proteins CD2AP / CIN85 . This observation supports the notion that Rich1 acts with Amot to mediate the uptake of selected TJ polypeptides . Interestingly , loss of Rich1 activity and high levels of Amot both induce defective TJs . The ﬁnding that Amot suppresses Rich1 GAP activity may explain this inverse relationship and indicates that overexpression of Amot re - sults in an increase in the fraction of Cdc42 bound to GTP . This is consistent with previous ﬁndings that DN and CA mutants of Cdc42 disrupt apical endocytosis ( Rojas et al . , 2001 ) and that CA Cdc42 induces the basal translo - cation of ZO - 1 ( Kroschewski et al . , 1999 ) , similar to Rich1 silencing in MDCK cells . Therefore , Amot binding to Rich1 may target Rich1 - associated endocytic components to TJs and also regulate the GAP activity of Rich1 to modu - late Cdc42 dependent effects on endocytosis . Amot and Rich1 in the Dynamic Regulation of Polarity The preceding data raise the possibility that Amot might be regulated by physiological stimuli that modify TJs . For example , Amot overexpression and Ca 2 + depletion promote a similar uptake of selective TJ components ( Shin et al . , 2005 ) , and partial silencing of Amot delays the loss of TER induced by Ca 2 + depletion in MDCK cells . Taken with the localization of Amot and Rich1 to AJs and TJs , it is attractive to speculate that these proteins may participate in the signals leading to breakdown of the TJ in response to loss of cadherin cohesion . Amot has been described as an angiostatin binding pro - tein that promotes cellular invasion and migration as well as the breakdown of cellular junctions in endothelial cells ( Bratt et al . , 2005 ; Levchenko et al . , 2004 ; Troyanovsky et al . , 2001 ) . That Amot is required for proper migration of the visceral endoderm in day 7 murine embryos ( Shimono and Behringer , 2003 ) and its speciﬁc expression in this structure ( Figure S4F ) strongly suggest an important role for Amot in migratory processes . However , the molec - ular mechanisms through which Amot controls migratory and invasive phenotypes are unclear . The ﬁnding that FL Amot , but not D C - term Amot , leads to a loss of MDCK cell polarity is consistent with data that the C - terminal mo - tif is required for Amot to increase the migratory or inva - sive index of endothelial cells ( Levchenko et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , the observation that CA Cdc42 speciﬁcally induces an epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition in chick somites is consistent with the notion that increased ex - pression of Amot may degrade apical polarity by inﬂuenc - ing Rich1 activity and thus the levels of Cdc42 GTP . This loss of polarity may in turn underlie the ability of Amot to promote migration . In summary , we deﬁne a novel network of protein inter - actions involved in epithelial polarity that links the Cdc42 GAP Rich1 and the scaffold Amot with polarity compo - nents such as Pals1 / Patj and Par - 3 . Rich1 and Amot ap - pear to maintain epithelial polarity through the integration of Cdc42 activity and the trafﬁcking of speciﬁc polarity proteins at the TJ . The balance of Amot activity therefore appears to control an equilibrium between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes . The requirement for the BAR / CC domain of Amot to localize to apical membranes , and to relocalize signaling components , suggests that it may play a direct role in these dynamic aspects of polarity .
