They form from multi - protein assemblies that are evolutionarily conserved between yeasts and humans . One of these assemblies — COMA — consists of subunits Ame 1 CENP - U , Ctf 19 CENP - P , Mcm 21 CENP - O and Okp 1 CENP - Q . A description of COMA molecular organization has so far been missing . We defined the subunit topology of COMA , bound with inner kinetochore proteins Nkp 1 and Nkp 2 , from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis , with nano - flow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry , and mapped intermolecular contacts with hydrogen - deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry . Our data suggest that the essential Okp 1 subunit is a multi - segmented nexus with distinct binding sites for Ame 1 , Nkp 1 - Nkp 2 and Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 . Our crystal structure of the Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 RWD domains bound with Okp 1 shows the molecular contacts of this important inner kinetochore joint . The Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 binding motif in Okp 1 configures a branch of mitotic inner kinetochores , by tethering Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 and Chl 4 CENP - N - Iml 3 CENP - L . Absence of this motif results in dependence on the mitotic checkpoint for viability .

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other budding yeasts , kinetochores assemble on ~ 120 – 300 base pairs of specific DNA — the centromere , and connect to a single microtubule ( Winey et al , 1995 ) . Kinetochores from other fungi , many animals and plants presumably consist of modular repeats of the kinetochore entity found in budding yeasts ( Zinkowski et al , 1991 ; Joglekar et al , 2008 ; Schleiffer et al , 2012 ; Westermann & Schleiffer , 2013 ; Weir et al , 2016 ) . The ~ 45 unique proteins that compose the core S . cerevisiae kine - tochore localize within a distance of ~ 80 nm between centromere and microtubule ( Joglekar et al , 2009 ) . Centromere - proximal proteins or microtubule - proximal proteins form inner kinetochore or outer kinetochore , respectively . Many of them organize in separa - ble protein assemblies ( De Wulf et al , 2003 ) , several of which are present in multiple copies ( Joglekar et al , 2006 ; Lawrimore et al , 2011 ) . One important inner kinetochore assembly that is conserved between budding yeasts and humans ( Schleiffer et al , 2012 ) is COMA ( De Wulf et al , 2003 ) . COMA’s counterpart in mammals is the CENP - O / P / Q / U assembly . COMA connects centromere - associated proteins and outer kinetochore ( Hornung et al , 2014 ; Dimitrova et al , 2016 ) . COMA includes the proteins “associated with microtubules and essential 1” ( Ame1 ) ( Cheeseman et al , 2002 ) , “chromosome transmission fidelity 19” ( Ctf19 ) ( Hyland et al , 1999 ) , “minichromosome maintenance 21” ( Mcm21 ) ( Poddar et al , 1999 ) and “outer kinetochore protein 1” ( Okp1 ) ( Ortiz et al , 1999 ) . These proteins are part of a supramolecular assembly from the inner kine - tochore , termed CTF19 , which contains eight other subunits that include “non - essential kinetochore protein 1” ( Nkp1 ) and “non - essential kinetochore protein 2” ( Nkp2 ) ( Cheeseman et al , 2002 ; De Wulf et al , 2003 ; Schleiffer et al , 2012 ) . Most CTF19 subunits are homologous to specific inner kinetochore subunits in mammals ( Schleiffer et al , 2012 ) . These inner kinetochore subunits form the constitutive centromere - associated network ( CCAN ) ( Foltz et al , 2006 ; Okada et al , 2006 ) . CCAN is the structural platform for outer kinetochore assembly ( Hori et al , 2013 ; Basilico et al , 2014 ; Weir et al , 2016 ) . Because of their overall homology , we use the term “CCAN” to refer to both the CCAN assembly and the CTF19 assem - bly . The specific functional relevance of several CCAN subunits is 1 Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA 2 Research Institute of Molecular Pathology ( IMP ) , Vienna , Austria 3 Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics , Polish Academy of Sciences , Warsaw , Poland 4 Department of Chemistry , Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory , University of Oxford , Oxford , UK 5 Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology , Biology Department , Warsaw University , Warsaw , Poland † Present address : Department of Molecular Genetics 1 , University of Duisburg - Essen , Essen , Germany ‡ Present address : Department of Genetics , University of Cambridge , Cambridge , UK § Present address : MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , UK * Corresponding author .

Ame1 CENP - U and Okp1 CENP - Q ( superscripts are human ortho - logue names ; or in the following , in the case of human protein names , budding yeast - orthologue names ) are essential for viability ( essential ) of S . cerevisiae ( Ortiz et al , 1999 ; Cheeseman et al , 2002 ; Hornung et al , 2014 ) . To understand construction principles , mechanistic functions and assembly of kinetochores , we need to know their subunit struc - ture , subunit contacts and relevance of specific molecular interfaces . We previously determined the structure of the double RWD ( D - RWD ) domains of Ctf19 CENP - P - Mcm21 CENP - O ( Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) . RWD domains are important recurring scaffolds in kinetochores ( Wei et al , 2006 ; Ciferri et al , 2008 ; Corbett & Harrison , 2012 ; Malvezzi et al , 2013 ; Nishino et al , 2013 ; Petrovic et al , 2014 ) . How the Ctf19 - Mcm21 D - RWD domains are contribut - ing to kinetochore assembly has remained unknown . Molecular subunit arrangement in COMA or CENP - O / P / Q / U , and their role in kinetochore configuration have been poorly understood . In recently reported biochemical reconstitutions of a human kinetochore ( Weir et al , 2016 ) or a human CCAN ( McKinley et al , 2015 ) , CENP - O / P / Q / U was not included . We found that COMA binds inner kinetochore proteins Nkp1 and Nkp2 . To obtain insight into arrangement of and contacts in COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 , we combined data from nanoflow electrospray ioniza - tion ( nanoflow ) mass spectrometry and hydrogen - deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry ( deuterium exchange ) . Through biochemical reconstitution of variant assemblies with trun - cations of the essential subunits Ame1 and Okp1 , we defined inner kinetochore assembly requirements . Data from these experiments were instrumental for our crystal structure determination of Ctf19 - Mcm21 with its interacting Okp1 segment . We show that the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif in Okp1 is an important tether in the molecular architecture of mitotic inner kinetochores , which is required for kinetochore function . Results Identification of a COMA - Nkp 1 - Nkp 2 assembly and its molecular composition We had previously described reconstitution of recombinant full - length COMA from K . lactis , by co - expression of Ame1 , Ctf19 , Mcm21 and Okp1 ( Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) . To understand COMA’s integration in the kinetochore , we sought to identify COMA interactions with other kinetochore proteins . We found that two recombinantly produced K . lactis CCAN subunits , Nkp1 and Nkp2 , form a heterodimer — Nkp1 - Nkp2 ( Appendix Fig S1A and B ) . An indication for association of Nkp1 with Nkp2 in S . cerevisiae extracts has previously been reported ( Brooks et al , 2010 ) . We found that Nkp1 - Nkp2 binds COMA , forming stable COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 ( Fig 1A ) . To understand the higher - order kinetochore archi - tecture , we need to determine stoichiometries of kinetochore subassemblies . We used nanoflow mass spectrometry , to obtain information about reconstituted COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 composition . In our nanoflow mass spectra of COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 or COMA , we observed dimers of COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 or COMA , respectively ( Fig 1B and C ) , which were more abundant when we analysed these assemblies at higher micromolar concentrations . In related experi - ments , we found that COMA bound with a four - protein core variant of MIND ( see Dimitrova et al , 2016 ) , the orthologue of the human MIS12 assembly , forms prominent COMA - MIND dimers ( Fig EV1A ) . In our mass spectra of COMA , COMA was predominantly mono - meric when we had analysed it at ~ 2 l M concentration ( Fig 1C ) . At concentrations of ~ 3 l M or ~ 6 l M , a COMA dimer became more apparent ( Fig 1C ) . These observations are consistent with our sedi - mentation - equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation data of COMA ( Appendix Fig S1C ) that indicate a monomer – dimer equilibrium in solution in the concentration range of ~ 3 – 8 l M ( for COMA monomer ) ; and our static light scattering measurements — COMA loaded at higher concentrations ( ~ 43 l M — for dimeric COMA ) on a size - exclusion chromatography column , elutes as a dimer ( Fig 1D ) . To obtain information about COMA subunit topology , we used nanoflow mass spectrometry in tandem mode with collision - induced dissociation of protein assemblies in the gas phase . In our mass spectra , we observed dimeric COMA subassemblies without Ctf19 , Mcm21 or Ctf19 - Mcm21 , but none without Ame1 - Okp1 ( Fig EV1B ) . These observations are consistent with our sedimentation - equilibrium ultracentrifugation data ( Appendix Fig S1D ) , and our previous observation ( Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) that Ctf19 - Mcm21 — on its own — is monomeric . We conclude that COMA dimerizes through Ame1 - Okp1 . Subunit arrangement in COMA - Nkp 1 - Nkp 2 In our nanoflow mass spectra of COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 , we found that Nkp1 and Nkp2 associate separately with COMA ( Fig EV2A and B ) , implying that both directly contact COMA . We did not find assem - blies that contain Ctf19 or Mcm21 and Nkp1 or Nkp2 , in the absence of Ame1 - Okp1 or Okp1 , suggesting that Ctf19 - Mcm21 does not contact Nkp1 - Nkp2 and that Ame1 - Okp1 is the principal binding ▸ Figure 1 .

We confirmed this suggestion by size - exclusion chromatography ( Fig EV3A and B ) . We conclude that Okp1 - Ame1 binds Nkp1 - Nkp2 . In spectra of tandem mass spectrometry of COMA , after its partial disruption with acetic acid in solution , we detected molecular masses corresponding to heterodimeric and heterotrimeric COMA subassemblies with all potential combinations of subunits , with the exception of those of Ame1 bound with Ctf19 , Mcm21 or Ctf19 - Mcm21 , in the absence of Okp1 ( Fig 2A and B , and Appendix Fig S2A and B ) . Our data suggest that in COMA , Okp1 contacts all other subunits and Ame1 interacts with Okp1 only . Flexible elements and structured segments in COMA proteins Dynamic light scattering data that we measured of dimeric COMA ( at ~ 21 l M concentration — assuming a COMA dimer ) indicate that it has a hydrodynamic radius of ~ 12 . 9 nm ( Appendix Fig S2C ) . In our electron micrographs of negatively stained COMA ( Appendix Fig S2D ) , however , we did not find distinctly shaped , globular particles , suggesting that , in the absence of other interact - ing macromolecules , COMA has flexible and / or unstructured elements . To identify flexible elements and structured segments of COMA in solution , we incubated COMA and COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 with deuterium oxide , and analysed mass spectra of their pepsin - proteo - lysed peptides . The deuterium - exchange patterns of Ctf19 or Mcm21 do not differ substantially between COMA and COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 ( Appendix Fig S3A and B ) , as we expected from our nanoflow mass spectra and size - exclusion chromatography experiments that we describe above . For Okp1 in COMA , we found that more than half of its 383 resi - dues exchanged rapidly with deuterium ( Fig 3A ; Appendix Fig S3C ) . Okp1 N - terminal regions ( residues 1 – 164 ) and Okp1 C - terminal regions ( 330 – 383 ) are lacking a stable hydrogen - bonding network . 5000 6000 0 % 100 m / z 28 + 29 + 30 + 27 + 26 + 25 + 4500 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 11000 12000 13000 14000 0 % 100 m / z 18 + 17 + 16 + 15 + 13 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 17 + 14 + 18 + 20 + 18 + 17 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + dissociatedsubunits 5500 28 + strippedtrimers dissociateddimers COMA B A Protein or protein assembly Expected molecular mass ( Da ) Measured molecular mass ( Da ) Ame1 32853 32882 ± 20 Ctf19 30805 30832 ± 14 Mcm21 33793 33793 ± 3 Okp1 44886 44845 ± 16 Ame1 - Okp1 77739 77656 ± 24 Ctf19 - Mcm21 64599 64640 ± 49 Ame1 - Ctf19 - Okp1 108544 108463 ± 66 Ame1 - Mcm21 - Okp1 111532 111417 ± 33 Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 109485 109425 ± 25 Ame1 - Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 ( COMA ) 142337 142469 ± 25 Ame1 - Ctf19 63658 not observed Ame1 - Mcm21 66646 not observed Ame1 - Ctf19 - Mcm21 97451 not observed Nanoflow mass - spectra of COMA Figure 2 .

The pronounced protease sensitivity of the Okp1 N - terminal regions that we observed with our limited proteolysis experiments ( see Figs EV4 and EV5 ; Tables EV1 and EV2 ) supports this suggestion . Okp1 parts that are protected the most from deuterium exchange in COMA are “core” ( residues 166 – 211 ) , “segment 2” ( residues 234 – 264 ) and “segment 1” ( residues 321 – 329 ) . In COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 , part of the Okp1 C - terminus — “segment 3” — is protected ( Fig 3A ) , which suggests that segment 3 binds Nkp1 - Nkp2 . We conclude that Okp1 has multiple structured segments , which are separated by flexible elements . To assess the relevance of the different structured Okp1 segments for cell viability , we replaced in diploid S . cerevisiae cells one of the two native Okp1 genes with a gene construct encoding either full - length Okp1 ( Okp1 _ fl ) or an Okp1 variant , which lacks one of the structured segments , with C - terminal flag epitopes ( e . g . Okp1 _ fl - 6 × flag ) . Our Okp1 variants lacked either most of core ( S . cerevisiae Okp1 residues 162 – 189 ) , segment 2 ( residues 236 – 265 ) , segment 1 ( residues 325 – 337 ) or segment 3 ( residues 353 – 400 ; for sequence position , see Fig EV5 ) . We evaluated viability of haploid spores after tetrad dissection . Tetrads of clones that encoded Okp1 versions without either core or segment 2 usually gave rise to only two viable haploid spores ( out of four ) , which encoded native Okp1 ( Appendix Fig S3D ) . Our isolated haploid spores that encoded Okp1 _ fl ( Okp1 _ fl ) , or Okp1 without segment 1 , or Okp1 without segment 3 were viable and grew similarly on solid standard growth medium ( Appendix Fig S3D ) . We conclude that core and segment 2 are essential for viability , and that segment 1 and segment 3 are not essential for viability . Deuterium - exchange patterns of Ame1 in COMA suggest that it has a central structured core , “Ame1 core” ( residues 129 – 247 ; Fig 3B ; Appendix Fig S3E and F ) , with N - and C - terminal elements , which , in the absence of other interacting macromolecules , are mostly flexible . We found with our limited proteolysis experiments that the Ame1 N - terminal region was particularly protease sensitive ( Fig EV4 ; Appendix Fig S3F ; Tables EV1 and EV2 ) . In COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 , the C - terminal Ame1 “segment 1” ( residues 268 – 292 ; Fig 3B ) is more protected , which suggests that , like Okp1 segment 3 , it inter - acts with Nkp1 - Nkp2 . Definition of COMA assembly requirements To explore the relevance of structured segments and terminal regions in Ame1 and Okp1 for COMA formation , we reconstituted COMA variants with truncations of Ame1 and Okp1 . The strongly associating D - RWD domains of Ctf19 and Mcm21 suffice for stable assembly with full - length Ame1 - Okp1 , while the N - terminal 106 residues of Ctf19 or Mcm21 are dispensable for COMA assembly ( Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) . We co - expressed coding regions for polyhistidine - tagged Mcm21 D - RWD domain ( His - Mcm21 D - RWD ) and Ctf19 D - RWD domain ( Ctf19 D - RWD ) , with coding regions for Ame1 truncations and Okp1 truncations ( Fig 4A ) ; screened for soluble protein production ; and purified assemblies with affinity chromatography ( Fig 4B ) . We found that N - terminal and C - terminal regions of Okp1 ( residues 1 – 122 and 337 – 383 ) and N - terminal and C - terminal regions of Ame1 ( residues 1 – 113 and 226 – 292 ) are dispensable for the formation of stable COMA variants . Minimized COMA variants form with Ame1 core , Okp1 core , Okp1 segments 1 and 2 , and the Ctf19 - Mcm21 D - RWD domain modules ( Fig 4B ) . We did not observe reconstitution of COMA variants with Okp1 versions that lack segment 1 . We conclude that Okp1 segment 1 is required for association of Okp1 - Ame1 with Ctf19 - Mcm21 . With a reconstitution strategy analogous to that for COMA , we found that Ame1 - Okp1 variants are stable in the absence of Ctf19 - Mcm21 ( Fig 4C ; Appendix Fig S4 ) . Ame1 - Okp1 forms with Ame1 core , and Okp1 core and segment 2 . Ame1 core and Okp1 segment 2 are predicted to be coiled coils , which suggests an Ame1 - Okp1 coiled coil . In contrast to COMA assembly , Ame1 - Okp1 assembly does not require Okp1 segment 1 ( Fig 4C ) . Okp1 segment 1 is selec - tively required for Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding . Consistent with this conclusion , we were unable to reconsti - tute Ctf19 D - RWD - Mcm21 D - RWD - Okp1 assemblies with Okp1 constructs that lack segment 1 , but we were able to reconstitute Ctf19 D - RWD - Mcm21 D - RWD - Okp1 assemblies with Okp1 constructs spanning core and segments 1 and 2 ( Fig 4D ) . We found that these Okp1 variants were prone to spontaneous proteolysis . In mass spectra of our purified Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 variants ( with Okp1 106 - 336 or Okp1 123 - 336 ( subscript denotes residue numbers ) ) , prominent Okp1 fragments that had co - purified with Ctf19 D - RWD - Mcm21 D - RWD included segments 1 and 2 , but lacked core ( one such fragment included residues 234 – 336 ) . Our observation suggested that Okp1 core is dispensable for binding Ctf19 - Mcm21 . We found indeed that a recombinant Okp1 variant ( residues 229 – 336 ) that includes segments 1 and 2 , but lacks core , binds Ctf19 - Mcm21 ( Fig 5A ) . This variant was less prone to spontaneous proteolysis than our above - described Okp1 variants . We conclude that Okp1 binding to Ctf19 - Mcm21 does not require Okp1 core . Ame 1 - Okp 1 C - termini bind Nkp 1 - Nkp 2 To test our suggestion , from deuterium - exchange data ( Fig 3A ) , that Okp1 segment 3 binds Nkp1 - Nkp2 , we combined our less proteo - lysis - prone Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 variant without segment 3 , or a similar variant that included segment 3 , with Nkp1 - Nkp2 , and analysed these combinations with size - exclusion chromatography . Our Ctf19 D - RWD - Mcm21 D - RWD - Okp1 variant without Okp1 segment 3 did not co - elute with Nkp1 - Nkp2 ( Fig 5A ) , but our Ctf19 D - RWD - Mcm21 D - RWD - Okp1 variant that includes Okp1 segment 3 co - eluted with Nkp1 - Nkp2 ( Fig 5B ) . Okp1 segment 3 binds Nkp1 - Nkp2 to COMA . To investigate the relevance of Okp1 segment 3 for recruit - ing Nkp1 - Nkp2 to centromeres in living cells , we genetically modified our haploid S . cerevisiae clones with Okp1 _ fl ( Okp1 _ fl ) or with Okp1 that lacks segment 3 . We modified these clones so that they encode green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fused to the C - terminus of either Nkp1 or Nkp2 . In living mitotically cycling cells of such clones , we monitored GFP signals with fluorescence microscopy . In Okp1 _ fl cells — budded or non - budded , Nkp1 - GFP and Nkp2 - GFP signals emanated from distinct foci that mark kinetochore clusters ( Fig 5C ) . In cells without Okp1 segment 3 , only residual fluores - cence of Nkp1 - GFP or Nkp2 - GFP was visible ( Fig 5C ; more of Nkp2 - GFP than of Nkp1 - GFP ) . We conclude that in living cells with Okp1 that lacks segment 3 ( Okp1 _ nn D ) , centromere localization of Nkp1 - Nkp2 is abrogated . Segment 3 is required for localization of Nkp1 and Nkp2 to centromeres .

Through analysis of our nanoflow mass spectra , we found that Nkp1 and Nkp2 sepa - rately contact Ame1 - Okp1 ( Fig EV2B ) , suggesting distinct binding sites in COMA for Nkp1 and Nkp2 . Nkp1 and Nkp2 both have unstructured C - terminal parts in Nkp1 - Nkp2 alone that are protected from deuterium exchange in COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 ( Fig 5D and E ; Tables EV1 – EV3 ; Appendix Fig S5A – D ) . In Nkp1 , more than 60 residues change protection , in Nkp2 ~ 45 residues — large regions , relative to their respective ( residue ) sizes . We conclude that Nkp1 C - terminal part and Nkp2 C - terminal part interact extensively with Ame1 - Okp1 . Comparison of the deuterium - exchange patterns of Nkp1 on its own with those in Nkp1 - Nkp2 ( Appendix Fig S5E ) suggests that the N - terminal part of Nkp1 binds Nkp2 . Our reconstitution experiments ( see Appendix Fig S5F ) support this suggestion . Since the Nkp2 C - - terminal part contacts Ame1 - Okp1 , the Nkp2 N - terminal part presumably contacts Nkp1 . Molecular basis for Okp 1 interactions in COMA To resolve interactions of Okp1 segments that we had identified , with our reconstitution experiments ( Fig 4 ) , as relevant for Ame1 or Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding in greater detail , we used deuterium exchange ( Appendix Fig S6A – E ) . Comparison of the exchange patterns of Okp1 peptides from full - length COMA with those from an Ame1 - Okp1 variant or from a Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 variant ( Fig 6A ) allowed us to detect differences in Okp1 , if either Ctf19 - Mcm21 or Ame1 was absent . With Ame1 bound , Okp1 segment 2 is protected from exchange ; in the absence of Ame1 , it is unprotected ( Fig 6A ) . We conclude that segment 2 binds Ame1 core . In the presence of Ctf19 - Mcm21 , Okp1 segment 1 is protected from exchange ( Fig 6A ; Appendix Fig S6A and C ) ; in the absence of Ctf19 - Mcm21 , it is disordered . Our observation confirms the require - ment of Okp1 segment 1 for Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding .

The deuterium - exchange patterns of Ctf19 or Mcm21 in Ctf19 - Mcm21 are essentially consis - tent with our previously reported data on flexible regions and the globular structure of the D - RWD domains of Ctf19 - Mcm21 ( Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) . Most of the N - terminal 100 resi - dues of Ctf19 or Mcm21 exchange rapidly ( except Ctf19 residues 38 – 56 ; see figure legend for Appendix Fig S6 ) . For Mcm21 , the exchange patterns in Ctf19 - Mcm21 and COMA are similar ; there are small dif - ferences only for peptides from its central a - helices ( a 2 , a 3 ; Fig 6B ; Appendix Fig S6E ) . For Ctf19 , we observe a dramatic difference for the hydrophobic , partially sequence - conserved C - terminal part of its C - terminal RWD domain ( RWD - C ) . This part is unprotected in the absence of Okp1 . With Okp1 bound , it is protected — even after long incubation periods with deuterium ( Fig 6B ; Appendix Fig S6D ) , suggesting a very strong association between Ctf19 and Okp1 . In our purified Ctf19 D - RWD - Mcm21 D - RWD - Okp1 - variant samples , Okp1 variants with segments 1 and 2 ( Okp1 229 – 336 ; Fig 5A ) , or with segments 1 , 2 and 3 ( Okp1 229 – 383 ; Fig 5B ) , spontaneously proteo - lysed , probably because their Ame1 binding site or Ame1 and Nkp1 - Nkp2 binding sites were unstructured . Corresponding Okp1 fragments , which we identified in our mass spectra , had N - termini corresponding to residues between segments 1 and 2 , and C - termini corresponding to residues at segment 3 N - terminus or at segment 1 C - terminus ( see legend to Fig EV4 ) . Guided by this observation , we designed an Okp1 variant ( Okp1 295 – 360 ) that , in addition to lacking Okp1 core and segment 3 , also lacks segment 2 — the Ame1 binding site . Reconstituted with Ctf19 D - RWD - Mcm21 D - RWD , this Okp1 variant was proteolysis resistant , and we purified this minimized stable assembly homogeneously ( Appendix Fig S7A ) . A similar mini - mized Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 variant that includes Okp1 segment 3 ( Okp1 295 – 383 ) bound Nkp1 - Nkp2 ( Appendix Fig S7B ) , as we had anticipated . We conclude that Okp1 binding segments specific for Ctf19 - Mcm21 , Nkp1 - Nkp2 or Ame1 are spatially separated . Structural determinants for Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 binding to Okp 1 The definition of a minimized stable Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 variant that includes Okp1 segment 1 ( Appendix Fig S7A ) , as we describe above , was essential to obtain diffracting crystals . In contrast to crystals that we obtained of full - length Ame1 - Okp1 bound with the Ctf19 - Mcm21 D - RWD domains , which did not diffract to higher than 50 A˚ resolution , our minimized ternary assembly formed diffracting crys - tals . We determined its structure with X - ray diffraction data extend - ing to 2 . 1 A˚ resolution ( Table EV4 ) . From our diffraction data , we modelled most of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 D - RWD domains . We did not observe substantial electron density for Okp1 295 – 360 residues 295 – 317 or 343 – 360 ( Appendix Fig S7C ) . Since we did not find indica - tions that Okp1 295 – 360 proteolysed in our crystals ( Appendix Fig S7D ) , we conclude that these residues are flexible . This conclusion is consistent with our deuterium - exchange data ( Figs 3A and 6A ) . Only Okp1 residues 318 – 342 are structured in our crystals ( Fig 6C and D ; Movie EV1 ) . Of these , residues 338 – 342 do not interact substantially with Ctf19 - Mcm21 . They interact with residues 318 – 342 of another Okp1 molecule — related by non - crystallographic twofold rotational symmetry . Because residues 338 – 342 are not conserved among budding yeasts ( Fig EV5 ) , we assume their inter - action in our crystals is a result of crystallization , rather than speci - fic for COMA dimerization . Okp1 residues 319 – 337 interact most extensively with Ctf19 ( ~ 850 A 2 of buried surface area ; Fig 6C ; Movie EV1 ) . Okp1 319 – 337 is crescent shaped and wraps around the penultimate a - helix ( a 5 ) of Ctf19 RWD - C — the area most protected from deuterium exchange with bound Okp1 ( Fig 6B ) . Okp1 segment 1 is the main binding site for Ctf19 - Mcm21 , as we anticipated from our biochemical character - ization . Segment 1 is a - helical and lies in the cleft between Ctf19 and Mcm21 , at the intersection of their D - RWD domains ( Fig 6C ) . This position protects it effectively from proteases . Okp1 segment 1 is followed by a short b - strand - like segment ( residues 330 – 332 ) that wedges in the Ctf19 hydrophobic groove between a 5 and b 8 , augmenting the b - sheet of Ctf19 RWD - C ( Fig 6D ; Appendix Fig S7E ) . Dipole – dipole interactions between the N - terminus of the Okp1 a - helix and the C - terminus of Ctf19 a 5 stabilize Ctf19 - Okp1 . Specific Ctf19 - Okp1 interactions are of Okp1 Phe329 ( a residue with a bulky hydrophobic side chain in this position is present among many budding yeasts ; Figs 6E and EV5 ) , with residues in the hydrophobic groove of Ctf19 RWD - C and of Okp1 Asn330 , which is at a distinctive kink in the structure right after segment 1 ( Fig 6D ) and conserved among budding yeasts , with the Ctf19 Pro236 oxygen . A proline in the equivalent sequence position of K . lactis Ctf19 Pro236 is conserved among Ctf19 proteins and orthologous mammalian CENP - P proteins ( see supplementary Fig S6B in ref . Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) . In the GCN1 RWD domain , the region that is structurally equivalent to the Ctf19 loop with Pro236 was shown to be important for folding and stability ( Nameki et al , 2004 ) . Our data ( also see figure legend to Appendix Fig S8 ) suggest that Okp1 binding stabilizes Ctf19 . Okp1 segment 1 side chains also contact side chains in Mcm21 a 2 and a 3 . We observe the following interaction pairs : Mcm21 _ Lys189 — Okp1 _ Glu320 , Mcm21 _ Lys200 — Okp1 _ Asp328 and Mcm21 _ Lys207 — Okp1 _ Asn330 ( Fig 6D ) . These contacts are consistent with small mass differences , of 1 or 2 Da , for deuterium - exchanged peptides from Mcm21 residues 190 – 207 in ◀ Figure 5 .

These residues are more protected with Okp1 bound . Binding to Ctf19 - Mcm21 stabilizes the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif of Okp1 ( Fig 6E ) , because in the absence of Ctf19 - Mcm21 , segment 1 is disordered ( Fig 6A ) . Our Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 structure is in excellent agreement with our deuterium - exchange data . We conclude that the hydrophobic groove in Ctf19 RWD - C and Mcm21 a 2 and a 3 are the principal binding sites for Okp1 in Ctf19 - Mcm21 . Specificity of the Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 binding motif To determine the affinity of our structurally defined Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif in Okp1 for Ctf19 - Mcm21 in solution , we measured , with isothermal titration calorimetry or microscale thermophore - sis , association of a synthetic Okp1 - derived peptide that includes the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif ( Okp1 residues 318 – 337 ; Fig 6E ) with full - length Ctf19 - Mcm21 . We derived a dissociation constant ( K d ) of ~ 40 nM or ~ 80 nM ( Fig 6F and G ) . The high binding affinity is consistent with the pronounced deuterium - exchange protection of Ctf19 RWD - C and Okp1 segment 1 ( Fig 6A and B ) . We also measured dissociation constants with Okp1 - variant peptides that differed from the native Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif in one or two residues ( Fig 6E ) that make important contacts with Ctf19 - Mcm21 in our structure . Such variants have a dissocia - tion constant that is two or three orders of magnitude higher than that of the native binding motif ( Fig 6G ) . We conclude that binding is sequence specific . A subset of inner kinetochore proteins depends on the Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 binding motif for centromere localization Confirming our results about the specificity of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif , in affinity purifications of recombinant K . lactis COMA with an Okp1 variant that lacks most of this motif ( residues 322 – 334 ; Okp1 _ cm D ; Fig 7A ) , we did not observe substantial amounts of Ame1 - Okp1 _ cm D co - purifying with Ctf19 - Mcm21 ( Appendix Fig S8A ) . To test the functional contribution of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif for COMA assembly in yeast cells , we genetically modified our haploid S . cerevisiae clones that encode full - length Okp1 or our Okp1 variant that lacks segment 1 ( resi - dues 325 – 337 ) — most of the part that corresponds to the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif in K . lactis Okp1 ( Fig 6E ) . We modified these clones , so that they encode myc epitopes fused to the Ctf19 C - terminus . From extracts of mitotic cells , Ctf19 co - immunoprecipi - tated with full - length Okp1 ( Okp1 _ fl ) — as we expected , but did not co - immunoprecipitate with Okp1 that lacks segment 1 ( Okp1 _ cm D ; Fig 7B ; Appendix Fig S8B and C ) . We conclude that the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif in Okp1 is selectively required for native COMA assembly . To investigate the relevance of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif for overall kinetochore organization in living mitotically cycling cells , we monitored with fluorescence microscopy the centromere localization of GFP - tagged subunits from the inner kinetochore or outer kinetochore , in S . cerevisiae clones Okp1 _ fl or Okp1 _ cm D . Ctf19 - GFP and Mcm21 - GFP co - localized with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) - tagged outer kinetochore protein Nuf2 , which marks kineto - chore clusters , in Okp1 _ fl , but did not co - localize in Okp1 _ cm D ( Fig 7C ) , consistent with our biochemical analyses . We observed this effect in unbudded , small budded and large budded cells . Centromere localization of Ame1 CENP - U , and Mtw1 MIS12 and Nnf1 PMF1 — kinetochore subunits of the MIND assembly that depend on Ame1 for centromere localization , was not affected in Okp1 _ cm D ( Fig 7D ; Appendix Fig S8D ) . This observation is in agreement with the selectivity of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif , which we had established with our biochemical experiments . The Mif2 CENP - C GFP signal was , however , substantially higher in Okp1 _ cm D than in Okp1 _ fl ( Fig 7D ) . Our observation is in general agreement with the observation that Mif2 CENP - C binds Ame1 CENP - U - Okp1 CENP - Q ( Hornung et al , 2014 ) , but that it does not bind Ctf19 CENP - P - Mcm21 CENP - O . We found , with our experiments with in vitro translated Mif2 , that COMA binds the central part of Mif2 ( Fig EV6A ) . With imaging experiments analogous to those that we describe above , we found that Chl4 CENP - N or Iml3 CENP - L did not specifically ◀ Figure 6 .

To test for such an interaction , we combined recombinant samples of Chl4 - Iml3 and COMA , from S . cerevisiae . Chl4 - Iml3 and COMA did not co - elute in size - exclusion chromatography , suggesting that in solution they do not bind each other — in the absence of posttranslational modifications or other macromolecular factors . We found , however , that under similar solution conditions , in vitro translated Chl4 associates with COMA ( Fig EV6B ) . In our microscopy images , centromere GFP signals of Ctf3 CENP - I , Mcm16 CENP - H , Mcm22 CENP - K , Cnn1 CENP - T or Wip1 CENP - W in Okp1 _ cm D were similar to those in Okp1 _ fl ( Fig 7D ; Appendix Fig S8D ) . Similar centromere localization dependencies of these sub - units in vivo are in agreement with their configuration in a stable assembly in vitro ( Pekgoz Altunkaya et al , 2016 ) . We found , with our experiments , however , that Mcm16 depends on the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif for co - immunoprecipitation with Okp1 , after isolation from S . cerevisiae extracts ( Appendix Fig S8E and F ) . Nkp1 localized to centromeres in Okp1 _ cm D , but substantially less of it than in Okp1 _ fl ( Fig 7D ) . We attribute the reduced localiza - tion to disruption of the Okp1 C - terminus in our Okp1 _ cm D variant , essentially in agreement with the — more pronounced — effect in Okp1 _ nn D ( Fig 5C ) . The Nkp2 - GFP signal was also lower in Okp1 _ cm D cells than in Okp1 _ fl cells ( Fig 7D ) , but less so than the Nkp1 - GFP signal . This observation is consistent with our biochemi - cal data that indicate separate Ame1 - Okp1 binding sites for Nkp1 and Nkp2 , and that Nkp1 and Nkp2 bind each other . We conclude that absence of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif selectively abrogates centromere localization of Chl4 , Ctf19 , Iml3 and Mcm21 ; but does not affect centromere localization of subunits of Ctf3 - Mcm16 - Mcm22 , Cnn1 - Wip1 or the outer kinetochore ( Fig 7E ) . The Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 binding motif is essential in the absence of a functional mitotic checkpoint Mutant clones Okp1 _ cm D , and similar mutant clones that lack coding regions for both the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif and the Nkp1 - Nkp2 binding motif — Okp1 _ cm D nn D are sensitive to benomyl ( a microtubule - depolymerizing chemical ) at elevated temperature ( Fig 8A ; Appendix Fig S9A ) . On solid standard growth medium , these mutants had similar vegetative growth as Okp1 _ fl ( Fig 8A ; Appendix Fig S9A ) , consistent with our observation that the motifs for binding Ctf19 - Mcm21 or Nkp1 - Nkp2 are required only for centromere localization of specific non - essential CCAN subunits . To generate more pronounced effects on CCAN structural integrity , we combined Okp1 _ cm D ( with Ctf19 - Mcm21 and Chl4 - Iml3 absent from mitotic centromeres ) with mutants that lack a specific CCAN subunit , whose mitotic centromere localization in living cells does not depend on the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif . For our Okp1 _ cm D cnn1 D mutant clones , we observed reduced growth in the presence of benomyl at 37 ° C , compared with Okp1 _ cm D or cnn1 D ( Fig 8A ) . We observed a similar , but less pronounced , effect for our Okp1 _ cm D ctf3 D mutant clones ( Appendix Fig S9B ) . Our observa - tions suggest that in mitotic cells , absence of multiple CCAN sub - units , whose centromere localization does not depend on each other , impairs kinetochore function , but does not abrogate it . Consistent with similar growth rates , we found that , within a few rounds of cell division in solution , the sister chromatid segregation fidelity of Okp1 _ fl or Okp1 _ cm D , both of which we had modified to encode fluorescently labelled chromosome 5 , was similar , as judged by the presence of GFP signals from two separated chromatids in large budded cells ( Appendix Fig S9C ) . We noticed , however , that Okp1 _ cm D took longer to complete mitosis relative to Okp1 _ fl . The delay was indicated by a higher fraction of large budded Okp1 _ cm D cells , which showed kinetochore localization of GFP - tagged mitotic checkpoint protein Bub1 ( Appendix Fig S9D ) , suggesting delay of anaphase onset through an active mitotic checkpoint . To investigate the relevance of the mitotic checkpoint for Okp1 _ cm D , we mated Okp1 _ cm D or Okp1 _ fl with a mutant that lacks the mitotic check - point protein Mad1 ( mad1 D ) . We observed , by tetrad dissection analysis , that haploid Okp1 _ cm D mad1 D spores were either not viable or grew very slowly after germination ( Fig 8B ) . Growth assays of genotyped spores ( Fig 8C ) , or conditional cellular Mad1 degradation ( Appendix Fig S9E and F ) , confirmed our observation . We conclude that in the absence of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif , a functional mitotic checkpoint is essential to maintain viability . Our analyses show that Okp1 _ cm D is benomyl sensitive ( Fig 8A ) and delays anaphase onset . Its mitotic phenotypes mimic those reported for chl4 D , ctf19 D or mcm21 D ( Hyland et al , 1999 ; Poddar et al , 1999 ; Pot et al , 2003 ) , as we expected from our biochemical data and our fluorescence microscopy data . To observe possible effects of the absence of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif on chromo - some segregation in meiosis , we evaluated the viability of germi - nated haploid spores that originated from homozygous diploids of ◀ Figure 7 .

Discussion Although centromere - associated proteins evolve rapidly , in animals and plants presumably due to “centromere drive” ( Henikoff et al , 2001 ; Drinnenberg et al , 2014 ) , budding yeasts’ kinetochores , which assemble on “point” centromeres , are surprisingly similar to human kinetochores and fission yeasts’ kinetochores , which assemble on “regional” centromeres , in protein composition and structural features ( Westermann & Schleiffer , 2013 ) . The orthologues for Ame1 and Okp1 ( Schleiffer et al , 2012 ) , which are essential for S . cerevisiae , are in vertebrates CENP - U / CENP - 50 ( Minoshima et al , 2005 ) and CENP - Q ( Okada et al , 2006 ) , respectively , and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mis17 ( Hayashi et al , 2004 ) and Fta7 ( Shiroiwa et al , 2011 ) , respectively . CENP - U and CENP - Q are , however , not essential for chicken cell lines ( Minoshima et al , 2005 ; Okada et al , 2006 ; Hori et al , 2008 ) , although CENP - U - deficient mouse embryos died ( Kagawa et al , 2014 ) . Yet , little mechanistic data have been reported for the function of CENP - O / P / Q / U or COMA . Okp 1 is a multi - segmented kinetochore nexus Our biochemical and structural analyses show the contributions of Okp1 to inner kinetochore organization . We defined in Okp1 three segments , which are spatially separated by flexible elements , that have distinct binding sites for different inner kinetochore proteins ( Fig 9A ) . We suggest that Okp1 is a multi - segmented molecular nexus . We characterized the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif as the principal contact of Okp1 with Ctf19 CENP - P - Mcm21 CENP - O ( Fig 9A ; Movie EV1 ) . We previously showed that the K . lactis Ctf19 - Mcm21 D - RWD domains , which are probably structurally similar in humans , suffice to associate Ctf19 - Mcm21 with Okp1 - Ame1 ( Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) . We have now shown that Okp1 binds the hydrophobic Ctf19 RWD - C surface , and central helices in the Mcm21 D - RWD domain . Our structure of Ctf19 - Mcm21 with the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif is the first described example of an RWD domain – peptide assembly from the inner kinetochore . We did not find major structural similarities in RWD domain – peptide inter - actions between our structure and those of the other reported kine - tochore RWD domains bound with peptides — Csm1 with a Mam1 peptide ( Corbett & Harrison , 2012 ) , Knl1 with an Nsl1 peptide ( Petrovic et al , 2014 ) and Spc24 - Spc25 either with a Cnn1 CENP - T peptide ( Malvezzi et al , 2013 ; Nishino et al , 2013 ) or with a Dsn1 peptide ( Dimitrova et al , 2016 ) ( Fig 9B ) . We conclude that binding modes of peptides to kinetochore RWD domains differ . Distinct modes ensure specificity in peptide recognition by RWD domains in kinetochore assembly . Our deuterium - exchange analyses show that , when bound to each other , Ctf19 - Mcm21 RWD domains and Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif of Okp1 stabilize each other , which probably contributes to binding specificity and kinetochore stability . Apart from a few residues that make important contacts in our structure , the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif’s sequence is , however , not very similar among budding yeasts ( Fig EV5 ) . Likewise , the residues of Ctf19 or Mcm21 that contact Okp1 are not conserved among budding yeasts . We explain the low similarity or absence of sequence conservation by co - evolution of the binding sites in both Ctf19 - Mcm21 and Okp1 , and main chain contacts that are phyloge - netically less restrained by residue identity . We were unable to iden - tify , by sequence comparison , a corresponding CENP - P / O binding motif in CENP - Q sequences ( Fig EV7 ) . We note , however , that a short a - helix , possibly related to the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif , is predicted in CENP - Q sequences for the region that corresponds to the motif in Okp1 sequences . Our data suggest that Okp1 segment 2 binds Ame1 core , probably through a coiled coil ( Fig 9A and C ) . This suggestion is supported by cross - linking data , which show that several lysines in the C - terminal part of Ame1 core are proximal to those C - terminal of Okp1 segment 2 ( Hornung et al , 2014 ) . Our S . cerevisiae mutant that lacks Okp1 segment 2 is not viable ( Appendix Fig S3D ) , consistent with our suggestion that segment 2 interacts with parts of another essential kinetochore subunit ( Ame1 ) . Sequences of Ame1 core and Okp1 segment 2 are very similar among budding yeasts’ Ame1 proteins and Okp1 proteins , respectively ( Fig EV5 ; Appendix Fig S3F ) . The equivalent segments in CENP - U proteins ( Appendix Fig S10 ) and CENP - Q proteins ( Fig EV7 ) probably are coiled coils too , suggesting that an Ame1 - Okp1 coiled coil , like the joint Ctf19 - Mcm21 D - RWD modules , is a structural feature conserved between yeasts and humans . It is thus plausible that a similar separation of binding sites for Ame1 CENP - U or Ctf19 CENP - P - Mcm21 CENP - O that we found in Okp1 CENP - Q is present in CENP - Q proteins . Our data show that Okp1 segment 3 , with probable contribution from Ame1 segment 1 , binds Nkp1 - Nkp2 . In our nanoflow mass spectra , we found a signal that corresponds to Nkp1 - Okp1 ( - Ctf19 - Mcm21 ; Fig EV2B ) , suggesting that Nkp1 is the primary Okp1 bind - ing partner of Nkp1 - Nkp2 . This suggestion is consistent with our observation in living cells ( of Okp1 _ nn D ) that Nkp1 and Nkp2 barely localize to kinetochores in the absence of Okp1 segment 3 ( Fig 5C ) . We presume that Ame1 segment 1 and Okp1 segment 3 bind Nkp2 and Nkp1 , respectively , which can explain why centro - mere localization of Nkp2 in cells without Okp1 segment 3 was less abrogated than that of Nkp1 . Nkp1 and Nkp2 presumably exist mainly as a heterodimer in living cells . Because Nkp1 - Nkp2 presum - ably brings the Ame1 C - terminus and the Okp1 C - terminus in prox - imity of one another , there could be a composite binding site . The C - termini of Okp1 or Ame1 are , however , not conserved in sequence . We found that Ame1 and Okp1 from Eremothecium gossypii , and from a few other budding yeasts that include Eremoth - ecium cymbalariae and Naumovozyma dairenensis , entirely lack C - terminal segments that are equivalent to those of K . lactis Ame1 segment 1 or the Nkp1 - Nkp2 binding site in K . lactis Okp1 , respec - tively ( Fig EV5 ; Appendix Fig S3F ) . Corresponding to this observa - tion , for E . gossypii , E . cymbalariae and N . dairenensis , we were unable to identify orthologues of Nkp1 or Nkp2 . We conclude that the Nkp1 - Nkp2 function is directly linked with the Okp1 C - terminus and the Ame1 C - terminus . Our data show that Nkp1 - Nkp2 binding makes these termini less flexible . We reason that Nkp1 and Nkp2 have regulatory roles for C - termini of Ame1 and Okp1 , which are auxiliary to inner kinetochore stability . With human CENP - O / P / Q / U co - purifies CENP - R ( Okada et al , 2006 ) . Although not similar in sequence to Nkp1 or Nkp2 , it may be their functional counterpart .

Several lysines in the conserved region that is preceding Okp1 core cross - linked with lysines in the Mif2 “signature” sequence ( Hornung et al , 2014 ) , suggesting these parts are proximal to each other . We have shown that this Mif2 sequence is required for binding COMA . A small N - terminal motif in Ame1 ( Appendix Fig S3F ) , which does not seem to be present in human CENP - U ( Appendix Fig S10 ) , is essential for S . cerevisiae for outer kinetochore assembly by bind - ing MIND ( Hornung et al , 2014 ; Dimitrova et al , 2016 ; Fig 9A ) . In the absence of MIND , our deuterium - exchange data show that this motif is disordered ( Fig 3B ) . We conclude that Ame1 , like Okp1 , has multiple contact sites for kinetochore proteins , which are spatially separated by flexible elements . Okp1 , Ame1 and Mif2 ( Cohen et al , 2008 ) , which are essential for S . cerevisiae and associ - ate with each other , are a group of dynamic multi - segmented molec - ular nexuses at the inner kinetochore . The elasticity of their flexible elements is presumably important during the dynamic events of kinetochore – microtubule attachment and chromosome movement . We conclude that inner kinetochore molecular organization is defined by flexible molecular nexuses and globular RWD domains and small peptides that form very stable interactions with each other ( Fig 9D ) . Except for the Ame1 binding site and Okp1 core , Okp1 sequence features differ from those of orthologous CENP - Q and Fta7 ( Fig EV7 ) , which have fewer residues than Okp1 . Most of the additional residues in Okp1 are in the sequence feature - variant , flexible N - terminus . Except for the conserved Ame1 core , Ame1 also differs substantially in sequence from CENP - U and Mis17 , which have more residues than Ame1 ( Appendix Fig S10 ) . Most of the additional residues are N - terminal of Ame1 core . The N - terminal regions of Ame1 , Okp1 , CENP - U ( Hori et al , 2008 ) and Mis17 ( Shiroiwa et al , 2011 ) are phosphorylated and may , as proposed for Mis17 , primarily have regulatory roles . We conclude from our sequence comparisons that COMA and CENP - O / P / Q / U have structural features in common , although overall sequence features diverged . Molecular assembly of COMA at kinetochores We have shown that Ame1 does not contact Ctf19 - Mcm21 and that its centromere localization is unaffected by the absence of Ctf19 - Mcm21 and Chl4 - Iml3 from mitotic centromeres . Previous analyses of temperature - sensitive S . cerevisiae clones with mutants of Ame1 or Okp1 indicated that for centromere localization , Ctf19 , Mcm21 and Okp1 depended on Ame1 , but Ame1 did not depend on the other COMA subunits ( Pot et al , 2005 ) . These data suggest that Ame1 is required , through its interaction with Okp1 , to localize Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 to mitotic centromeres . We have shown that COMA tends to dimerize through Ame1 - Okp1 . At kinetochores , a dimer is presumably stabilized by contacts that increase COMA’s effective concentration ( Fig 9D ) . Consistent with this presumption , we have shown that COMA - MIND dimerizes ( Fig EV1A ) . Measurements in human cells indi - cated that CENP - O / P / Q / U oligomerizes through CENP - Q / U at mitotic kinetochores ( Eskat et al , 2012 ) . Quantification from live cell fluorescence microscopy yielded estimates that are consistent with three to eight Ctf19 molecules and up to four Mif2 molecules for each S . cerevisiae kinetochore ( Joglekar et al , 2006 ; Lawrimore et al , 2011 ) . CENP - C Mif2 binds CENP - A Cse4 nucleosomes ( Kato et al , 2013 ) , and Mif2 dimerizes ( Cohen et al , 2008 ) . Our data suggest that COMA multimerization is an important effector for amplification of the Cse4 kinetochore nucleation signal , through provision of multiple binding sites to MIND , for outer kinetochore assembly ( Fig 9D ) . The Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 binding motif configures a branch of functionally related inner kinetochore subunits Our characterization of COMA guided us to analyse the specific role of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif for kinetochore organiza - tion in living cells . Mutant Okp1 _ cm D , without the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif , is defective in localizing Ctf19 CENP - P - Mcm21 CENP - O and Chl4 CENP - N - Iml3 CENP - L to mitotic centromeres . Our observations are in agreement with the previously described centromere local - ization dependence of Chl4 - Iml3 on Ctf19 in diploid S . cerevisiae cells ( Pot et al , 2003 ) . Chl4 binds Mif2 CENP - C in vitro ( Hinshaw & Harrison , 2013 ) , but — in the absence of Ctf19 - Mcm21 — this inter - action does not suffice to centromere - localize Chl4 - Iml3 in vivo . Because we did not observe association of Chl4 - Iml3 with COMA in solution , their stable association presumably requires simultane - ous binding by Mif2 . Our binding experiments ( Fig EV6 ) suggest that Chl4 - Iml3 interacts through Chl4 with Ctf19 - Mcm21 . An inter - action of Chl4 may be with the parts N - terminal of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 D - RWD domains , which contain conserved residues and were disordered in crystals of full - length Ctf19 - Mcm21 ( Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) . The D - RWD domains them - selves have few conserved surface residues outside of the Okp1 binding site . Our live cell microscopy images show that mitotic centromere localization of Ctf3 CENP - I , Mcm16 CENP - H , Mcm22 CENP - K , Cnn1 CENP - T or Wip1 CENP - W , which form an assembly that contacts the NDC80 assembly ( Pekgoz Altunkaya et al , 2016 ) , does not depend on the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif , and — by extension — on Ctf19 - Mcm21 and Chl4 - Iml3 . Previous reports described that Ctf3 localized to centromeres in living anaphase mutant cells that lacked Ctf19 or Chl4 ( Pot et al , 2003 ) . In immunoprecipitated isolates from S . cere - visiae cell extracts , however , Ctf3 depended on Ctf19 or Mcm21 for co - immunoprecipitation with Ame1 or centromeric DNA ( Measday et al , 2002 ; Pekgoz Altunkaya et al , 2016 ) , and Mcm16 depended on the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif for co - immunoprecipitation with Okp1 ( Appendix Fig S8E and F ) , suggesting that conditions in extracts do not fully reflect native - like centromere localization requirements for Ctf3 or Mcm16 . We assume that chromatin - binding motifs , such as present in Cnn1 and Wip1 , and DNA - binding activi - ties , which remain to be characterized , contribute to localization of Ctf3 or Mcm16 to centromeres in living cells . We conclude that the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif in Okp1 config - ures a “branch” of functionally related subunits of the CCAN assem - bly , by tethering Ctf19 - Mcm21 and — indirectly — Chl4 - Iml3 to mitotic centromeres ( Fig 9D ) . This motif defines a kinetochore assembly axis that is parallel to the assembly axis for the outer kinetochore , which is based on contacts of Ame1 or Mif2 with Mtw1 - Nnf1 , and Cnn1 or Dsn1 with Spc24 - Spc25 . In contrast to the effect of absence of Ctf19 - Mcm21 on Chl4 - Iml3 centromere localization in S . cerevisiae , absence of CENP - O Mcm21 or The EMBO Journal Vol 36 | No 23 | 2017 ª 2017 The Authors The EMBO Journal RWD domain – peptide interactions at the inner kinetochore Florian Schmitzberger et al 3474 CENP - P Ctf19 did not affect CENP - L Iml3 centromere localization in human cells ( Okada et al , 2006 ; McKinley et al , 2015 ) , nor recombi - nant human CENP - N Chl4 - CENP - L Iml3 binding to reconstituted CENP - A Cse4 nucleosomes ( Weir et al , 2016 ) . We conclude that between budding yeasts’ COMA or Chl4 - Iml3 , and their mammalian ortho - logues CENP - O / P / Q / U or CENP - N / L , respectively , there are impor - tant differences in contacts with other mitotic kinetochore subunits . Protein connections in CCAN evolved . Relevance of the Ctf 19 - Mcm 21 binding motif for chromosome segregation The pronounced dependence of cells that lack the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif on the mitotic checkpoint suggests that , in the absence of Ctf19 - Mcm21 and Chl4 - Iml3 , these cells have kineto - chore – microtubule attachment errors . If cell cycle progression is not delayed by the mitotic checkpoint for correction of these errors , these errors result in chromosome mis - segregation . Mis - segregation rates of artificial chromosomes or native chromosomes were indeed elevated in mitotic cells with chl4 D , ctf19 D or mcm21 D ( Hyland et al , 1999 ; Poddar et al , 1999 ; Pot et al , 2003 ; Fernius & Marston , 2009 ) , and a relevance of Ctf19 CENP - P for mitotic checkpoint func - tion was reported ( Matson et al , 2012 ) . We conclude that mitotic kinetochore function is impaired in the absence of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif . One probable source of kinetochore – microtubule attachment errors in mitotic cells without the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif is a pericentromeric cohesion defect . Pericentromeric cohesin load - ing in budding yeasts’ meiosis and mitosis depends on Ctf19 - Mcm21 and Chl4 - Iml3 ( Fernius & Marston , 2009 ; Natsume et al , 2013 ) . Pericentromeric cohesion facilitates mitotic kinetochore biorientation ( Ng et al , 2009 ) and meiotic sister chromatid co - orientation . Absence of Chl4 , Ctf19 , Iml3 or Mcm21 in meiosis results in chromosome / chromatid non - disjunction and aneu - ploidy ( Fernius & Marston , 2009 ; Mehta et al , 2014 ) . In contrast to the pronounced meiotic phenotype of homozygous diploid Ctf19 deletion mutants , the phenotype of our homozygous diploid Okp1 _ cm D mutant , which we had expected to be similar to that of Ctf19 D , was near native . Our finding suggests that , instead of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif , other factors retain Ctf19 - Mcm21 at meiotic kinetochores . We conclude that there are important structural differences between inner meiotic kine - tochores and inner mitotic kinetochores . Recent studies reported differences between outer meiotic kinetochores and outer mitotic kinetochores ( Mehta et al , 2014 ; Meyer et al , 2015 ) . Exploring inner kinetochore structural differences , and identifying the factors accounting for them , will be relevant to understand kine - tochore plasticity . Our presented data inform on structure , topology and subunit connections of the inner mitotic kinetochore , and contribute to a conceptual framework for further characterization of its dynamic architecture . Materials and Methods For a detailed description of our materials and methods , see our Appendix Supplementary Materials and Methods section . Molecular cloning , site - directed mutagenesis , recombinant protein production and protein purification We constructed most of our polycistronic plasmids similarly as previously described ( Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) , by integrat - ing coding regions ( for full - length proteins or truncation variants ) into a pET - based plasmid ( with T7 DNA polymerase promoter ) encoding a tobacco - etch virus ( TEV ) protease cleavable N - terminal polyhistidine tag . Coding regions for S . cerevisiae COMA were inserted into a pST39 plasmid ( Tan , 2001 ) . We generated our K . lactis COMA variant that lacks the coding region for Okp1 segment 1 by QuikChange - based site - directed mutagenesis with PfuTurbo DNA Polymerase AD ( Agilent Technologies ) . For a list of our plasmids and constructs , see Table EV5 . Plasmids are available upon request . We produced recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 Rosetta 2 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells , usually in terrific broth , by induc - tion with isopropyl - b - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . We adapted our small - scale 96 - well plate - based screening method for protein production and Ni 2 + affinity chromatography protein purification from previously described methods ( Savitsky et al , 2010 ) . For large - scale purification , we purified proteins first with Ni 2 + affinity chromatography at 4 ° C . Most of our proteins we subsequently incu - bated with TEV protease ( Kapust et al , 2001 ) for 16 – 18 h at 4 ° C . After another Ni 2 + affinity purification step , we purified proteins from the affinity chromatography flow - through fraction with ion - exchange chromatography ( 5 ml HiTrap Q HP column or 5 ml HiTrap SP HP column , GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) , followed by SEC ( Superdex 200 HiLoad 16 / 600 prep grade column ; GE Health - care Life Sciences ) at 4 ° C . We produced and purified S . cerevisiae Okp1 - Ame1 similarly as previously described ( Hornung et al , 2014 ) . Hydrogen - deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry For our comparative deuterium - exchange experiments , we used purified protein samples that we had flash - frozen in liquid N 2 and had stored at (cid:1) 80 ° C and on solid CO 2 . We carried out deuterium - exchange experiments similarly as previously described ( Kupniewska - Kozak et al , 2010 ) , with a reaction buffer containing D 2 O ( 99 . 8 % ( v / v ) ; Armar Chemicals ) . We quenched deuterium - exchange reactions by reducing the pH to ~ 2 . 5 with 2 M glycine . We digested deuterium - exchanged proteins using an immobilized pepsin column ( Poroszyme , Applied Biosystems , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . We injected digested peptides into the nanoACQUITY ( Waters Corporation ) Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography ( UPLC ) system , and separated peptides over a C18 trapping column ( ACQUITY BEH C18 VanGuard Pre - column , Waters Corporation ) , followed by separation over a reversed - phase chromatography column ( ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column , Waters Corporation ) . The outlet of the latter column was coupled directly to the ion source of a SYNAPT G2 HDMS mass spectrometer ( Waters Corpora - tion ) . We identified peptides with the ProteinLynx Global Server software ( Waters Corporation ) . We carried out two kinds of control experiments to determine experimental in - exchange — our minimum exchange value ð M 0 ex Þ , or back - exchange values — our maximum exchange value ( M 100 ex ) , as previously described ( Kupniewska - Kozak et al , 2010 ) . We calculated the deuteration level of peptides ( M ex ) with DynamX ( Waters Corporation ) , using as reference the m / z values from non - deuterated pepsin - proteolysed peptides that we ª 2017 The Authors The EMBO Journal Vol 36 | No 23 | 2017 Florian Schmitzberger et al RWD domain – peptide interactions at the inner kinetochore The EMBO Journal 3475 calculated with the ProteinLynx Global Server . We calculated the fraction of peptide deuterium exchange ( f ) with the formula : f ¼ M ex (cid:1) M 0 ex M 100 ex (cid:1) M 0 ex We calculated mean value and standard deviation for f from at least three independent experiments . We visualized our exchange data with a previously described Excel macro ( Black et al , 2007 ) that plots deuterium - exchanged peptide representa - tions that are coloured by fraction of deuterium exchange , underneath their corresponding position in a linear amino acid sequence representation of the protein the respective peptides originate from . Our raw deuterium - exchange data are available upon request . Nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry For our nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry , we used purified protein samples that we had flash - frozen in liquid N 2 and had stored at (cid:1) 80 ° C and on solid CO 2 . We transferred proteins to a buffer of 200 mM ammonium acetate pH 6 . 7 – 7 . 3 or pH 7 . 4 , and sprayed protein samples , usually at a concentration of 2 – 10 l M , with in - house prepared gold - coated glass capillaries ( Nettleton et al , 1998 ) . We acquired mass spectra or tandem mass spectra ( Benesch et al , 2006 ) , in positive ion mode , on a high mass Q - TOF - type instrument ( Sobott et al , 2002 ) adapted for a QSTAR XL platform ( MDS Sciex ) ( Chernushevich & Thomson , 2004 ) . For collision - induced dissociation , we used argon as a colli - sion gas at maximum pressure . We carried out partial , in - solution disruption of purified K . lactis COMA ( Fig 2A and B ; Appendix Fig S2A ) , by adding acetic acid to a concentration of 5 % ( v / v ) in 100 mM ammonium acetate , to a pH of 4 . 0 . For our analysis of Ctf19 - Mcm21 - Okp1 that we show in Appendix Fig S2B , we analo - gously incubated COMA with 100 mM ammonium acetate pH 3 . 7 , 5 % ( v / v ) acetic acid . Limited proteolysis followed by mass spectrometry We used purified protein samples , which we had stored on ice after purification , for our limited proteolysis experiments with trypsin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or elastase ( Worthington Biochemical Corporation ) . We incubated COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 in a 10 : 1 molar ratio with trypsin for 180 , 240 s or 600 s , or in a 10 : 1 molar ratio with elastase for 180 s , at 22 – 25 ° C . We incubated Ame1 - Ctf19 D - RWD - Mcm21 D - RWD - Okp1 in a 10 : 1 molar ratio with trypsin for 255 s , at 22 – 25 ° C . We stopped our proteolysis reactions by adding 4 - ( 2 - aminoethyl ) benze - nesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride ( AEBSF ) solution to a concentra - tion of ~ 1 . 5 mM , and gel - filtered samples on a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16 / 600 prep grade column ( Fig EV4 ) . We pooled fractions corre - sponding to the principal elution peak , and denatured samples by the addition of solid high - grade guanidine hydrochloride ( cat . no 50933 , Sigma - Aldrich ) until saturation of the solution . For limited proteolysis without subsequent SEC , we incubated COMA - Nkp1 - Nkp2 in a molar ratio of 10 : 1 with elastase or trypsin , for 180 s or 600 s , at 22 – 25 ° C ; we incubated K . lactis Nkp1 - Nkp2 in a molar ratio of 10 : 1 with elastase or trypsin , for 300 s or 600 s , at 22 – 25 ° C , before the addition of solid high - grade guanidine hydrochloride . David S . King analysed protein fragments with Fourier transform ion resonance cyclotron or ion - trap mass spectrometers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute mass spectrometry facility ( University of California , Berkeley ) , and analysed mass spectra . For information about our protein fragments that we identified , see Tables EV1 – EV3 . Binding assays with in vitro translated proteins Plasmids or PCR products with coding regions for proteins for in vitro translation with a Kozak translation initiation sequence we prepared as previously described ( Hinshaw & Harrison , 2013 ) . We produced S 35 - labelled proteins by in vitro translation in rabbit - reticulocyte lysate ( TnT lysate systems ; Promega Corporation ) with S 35 L - methionine , following the manufacturer’s instructions . For our binding assays , we used K . lactis COMA that we had stored on ice or at (cid:1) 80 ° C after purification , or S . cerevisiae COMA and poly - histidine - tagged maltose binding protein that we had stored at (cid:1) 80 ° C . Analytical size - exclusion chromatography , multi - angle laser light scattering measurements and dynamic light scattering measurements We carried out analytical SEC for samples that we show chro - matograms in Figs 5A and B , and EV3A on a Superdex 200 10 / 300 column ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) on an A¨kta FPLC ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) system , at 4 ° C . For our sample analysis that we show chromatograms in Fig EV3B , we carried out SEC with a Superdex 200 PC 3 . 2 / 300 column ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) on an Ettan LC system ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . For our analysis that we show chromatograms in Appendix Fig S7B , we used a Superdex 200 HiLoad 10 / 600 prep grade column . For details , see our Appendix Supplementary Materials and Meth - ods . We measured multi - angle laser light scattering data on a Dawn Heleos - II detector ( Wyatt - 846 - H2 ; Wyatt Technology ) and refractive indices with an Optilab T - rEX instrument ( Wyatt - 512 - Trex ; Wyatt Technology ) , eluting proteins from a Superdex 200 10 / 300 SEC column that was mounted on a high - performance liquid chromatography system ( 1260 Infinity LC ; Agilent Technolo - gies ) . We analysed multi - angle laser light scattering data with the Astra software ( Wyatt Technology ) , with protein concentrations determined from in - line refractive index measurements and using a dn / dc value of 0 . 185 ml / g ( a refractive index of 1 . 33 was chosen for the aqueous solution ) . We fit our multi - angle laser light scatter - ing data with a first - order Zimm function with linear regression , as implemented in the Astra software . We measured dynamic light scattering data of K . lactis COMA in a quartz cuvette on a Dynapro instrument ( Wyatt Technology ) with a laser of 826 . 2 nm , at 15 ° C . We fit monomodal auto - correlation functions for our data with the Dynamics software ( Wyatt Technology ) . Our light scattering data are available upon request . Sedimentation - equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation analyses For our sedimentation - equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation , we used purified protein samples , which we had stored on ice after The EMBO Journal Vol 36 | No 23 | 2017 ª 2017 The Authors The EMBO Journal RWD domain – peptide interactions at the inner kinetochore Florian Schmitzberger et al 3476 purification . We recorded sedimentation - equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation data with a ProteomeLab Optima XL - I analytical ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Coulter ) and an An - 60 Ti rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) equipped with a 12 - mm - wide Epon six - chamber double - sector sample cell . We calculated estimates of the partial specific protein assembly volumes ( based on the molecular weight expected from the protein sequences ) , buffer density and buffer viscosity with SEDNTERP ( http : / / www . jphilo . mailway . com / download . htm ) . We fit our data with SEDPHAT ( http : / / www . analyticalultracentrifu gation . com / sedphat / sedphat . htm ) . We visualized our data with GUSSI ( http : / / biophysics . swmed . edu / MBR / software . html ) . For details about our fitting procedure , see our Appendix Supplementary Materials and Methods . Isothermal calorimetry titration ( ITC ) measurements and microscale thermophoresis ( MST ) measurements For our ITC or MST measurements , we used Okp1 - derived peptides synthesized by Mathias Madalinski at the Protein Chem - istry core facility ( IMP , Vienna ) . We carried out ITC measure - ments on a MicroCal VP - ITC calorimeter ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . We transferred 1 . 42 ml of Ctf19 - Mcm21 sample solu - tion at 13 l M to the calorimeter reaction cell that was kept at 25 ° C . Okp1 - derived peptide , with the Ctf19 - Mcm21 binding motif , at 120 l M was injected into the reaction cell ; the first injection was with 5 l l ( over 10 s ) , followed by 29 injections , each lasting 20 s , of 10 l l . Injections were repeated every 300 s . The ITC reaction cell was under continuous stirring at 307 rpm . We subtracted from data of these measurements the reference signal of our Okp1 - derived peptide titrated to ITC / MST buffer . We used Origin software ( OriginLab ) to derive the K d , by fitting a non - linear single set of sites binding function with chi 2 mini - mization to our data . We did three independent measurements that yielded similar ITC data , from which we derived mean value and standard error of regression ( Fig 6F ) . For our MST measurements ( Wienken et al , 2010 ) , we labelled purified Ctf19 - Mcm21 with a red fluorescent dye ( NT - 647 - NHS ) , which cova - lently modifies lysine side chains , in company - provided “label - ling buffer” at 22 – 25 ° C , according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Nanotemper Technologies ) , with a 1 : 4 molar ratio of Ctf19 - Mcm21 and dye . We transferred fluorescently labelled Ctf19 - Mcm21 and Okp1 - derived peptide , or variants of Okp1 - derived peptide ( Fig 6G ) , to ITC / MST buffer . We prepared dilu - tion series of peptides , and combined with a uniform volume of Ctf19 - Mcm21 in PCR tubes , before transferring to NT . 115 MST premium - coated glass capillaries ( Nanotemper Technologies ) . For all our measurements , the total Ctf19 - Mcm21 concentration in the capillaries was ~ 27 nM . We measured MST data on an NT . 115 Monolith BLUE / RED instrument ( Nanotemper Technolo - gies ) at 22 – 25 ° C . Samples were heated with an infrared laser ( k : 1 , 474 nm (cid:3) 15 nm ) set to 20 % MST power ( 30 s on ; 5 s off ) , and fluorophores excited with a laser ( excitation k : 625 nm ; emission k : 680 nm ) set to 60 % LED power . For all our MST measurements , fluorescence intensity counts were 350 – 500 . We derived our binding data from the “thermophoresis + T jump” fluorescence signal . For each unique peptide sample , we measured data from three separately prepared dilution series . For our MST data analysis , we used NTAffinityAnalysis software ( version 2 . 0 . 2 ; Nanotemper Technologies ) . We derived K d values by least - squares fitting the following law of mass action func - tion , as previously described ( Seidel et al , 2013 ) : y ¼ U þð B (cid:1) U Þ(cid:4)ð x þ c labelled þ K d (cid:1) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ x þ c labelled þ K d ð Þ 2 (cid:1) 4 (cid:4) x (cid:4) c labelled q Þ 2 (cid:4) c labelled U : fluorescence of unbound Ctf19 - Mcm21 ( base level ) ; B : fluores - cence of bound Ctf19 - Mcm21 ( saturation level ) ; c labelled : concentra - tion of labelled protein ; K d : dissociation constant ; x : concentration of peptide ; y : fluorescence . Electron microscopy For electron microscopy ( Appendix Fig S2D ) , our final purification step for K . lactis COMA was with SEC with a buffer of 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl and 0 . 5 mM TCEP . We stored purified protein samples on ice for ca . 16 – 24 h after the final purification step , before transferring them , at a concentration of ~ 70 nM , onto carbon - coated copper - mesh grids ( CF - 400 - Cu , Electron Microscopy Science ) . We stained COMA samples with uranyl formate . We imaged with a T12 ( FEI Tecnai ) transmission electron microscope , usually at 80 kV accelerating voltage . Protein crystallization , crystal structure determination and coordinate refinement We crystallized our minimized K . lactis Ctf19 107 – 270 - Mcm21 108 – 293 - Okp1 295 – 360 protein assembly , which we had stored on ice after purification , with 35 % ( v / v ) glycerol ethoxylate and 200 mM Li - citrate . Crystals with dimensions of 50 l m × 50 l m × 50 l m – 100 l m × 100 l m × 100 l m grew typically within 1 – 4 days , at 20 ° C . From our crystals , cryo - cooled at (cid:1) 173 . 5 ° C , we collected X - ray diffraction data at beamline 24 - ID - E of the Advanced Photon Source ( Argonne National laboratory ) with a charge - coupled device detector ( Quantum 315 ; Area Detector Systems Corpora - tion ) and a microdiffractometer . We indexed and integrated X - ray diffraction data with XDS ( Kabsch , 1993 ) , and scaled our inte - grated data with Aimless ( Evans & Murshudov , 2013 ) of the CCP4 suite ( Winn et al , 2011 ) , keeping Friedel pairs separated . We determined our crystal structure in space group P22 1 2 1 , by molec - ular replacement with the coordinates of the Ctf19 - Mcm21 ( PDB code : 3ZXU ; Schmitzberger & Harrison , 2012 ) D - RWD domains ( Ctf19 107 – 270 - Mcm21 108 – 293 ) with phenix Phaser ( McCoy et al , 2007 ) . We used phenix . AutoBuild ( Adams et al , 2010 ) for initial rebuilding and refinement of our structure . We subsequently refined our model with phenix . refine ( Afonine et al , 2012 ) , with a maximum - likelihood target function with a test set of 2 . 4 % of randomly selected reflection indices , and manually rebuilt our model in r A - weighted electron density maps with COOT ( Emsley & Cowtan , 2004 ) , until convergence of the R free . We used crystallo - graphic data analyses software provided by SBGrid ( Morin et al , 2013 ) . We prepared our molecular structure representations ( Figs 6 and 9 ; Appendix Fig S7C and E ) and movie ( Movie EV1 ) with PyMOL Molecular Graphics System ( Schro¨dinger , LLC ) . For details of data collection , coordinate refinement and final model quality , see Table EV4 . ª 2017 The Authors The EMBO Journal Vol 36 | No 23 | 2017 Florian Schmitzberger et al RWD domain – peptide interactions at the inner kinetochore The EMBO Journal 3477 Analysis of protein structure and amino acid sequences We evaluated our protein model coordinates with Molprobity ( Chen et al , 2010 ) and WHATCHECK ( Hooft et al , 1996 ) . For pairwise superposition of structure coordinates , we used LSQKAB ( Kabsch , 1976 ) or SSM ( Krissinel & Henrick , 2004 ) . We analysed protein interfaces with PISA ( Krissinel & Henrick , 2007 ) . We used COILS for coiled - coil predictions ( Lupas et al , 1991 ) . For identification of homologous amino acid sequences , we used PsiBlast ( Altschul et al , 1997 ) and the non - redundant National Center for Biotechnology Information protein database . We generated multiple amino acid sequence alignments ( Fig EV5 ; Appendix Figs S3F and S5C and D ) with TCoffee ( Notredame et al , 2000 ) and formatted them with Espript ( Gouet et al , 1999 ) with the Blosum60 substitution matrix ( Henikoff & Henikoff , 1992 ) . For sequence alignments of yeast sequences of Ame1 or Okp1 , and animal sequences of CENP - U or CENP - Q that we show in Fig EV7 and Appendix Fig S10 , we used TCoffee with the PSI - Coffee option ( Kemena & Notredame , 2009 ) . Genetic modification , culturing and growth assays of S . cerevisiae Most of our S . cerevisiae clones are derivatives of S288C type , unless specified otherwise in Table EV6 . General S . cerevisiae genetic manipulation methods and media recipes for culturing and growth assays on solid medium were similar as described ( Amberg et al , 2005 ) . For our Okp1 _ fl native locus integration construct , we ampli - fied , from S . cerevisiae genomic DNA , in one PCR a fragment of 250 bp of the 5 0 untranslated region ( UTR ) immediately upstream of the coding region of Okp1 and the coding region for Okp1 ; in a sepa - rate PCR , 250 bp 3 0 UTR immediately downstream of Okp1 ; and from a pU6 plasmid a coding region for a 6 × flag epitope . We assem - bled by PCR , from these fragments , a single DNA fragment , which has an NheI restriction enzyme site between the 3 0 UTR and 5 0 UTR sequences , that we ligated into plasmid pRS305 ( Sikorski & Hieter , 1989 ) , with isothermal assembly ( Gibson et al , 2009 ) , to generate plasmid Okp1 _ fl - 6 × flag - pRS305 . We generated our Okp1 integration constructs that lack coding regions for specific Okp1 segments by QuikChange - based site - directed mutageneses of Okp1 _ fl - 6 × flag - pRS305 with PfuTurbo DNA Polymerase AD or PfuUltra II Fusion Hot - Start DNA Polymerase ( Agilent Technologies ) . For genomic integration in S . cerevisiae , we digested plasmids with NheI ( New England BioLabs ) , transformed into diploid S . cerevisiae and selected single colonies that grew on solid agar with minimal synthetic complete medium without leucine . We sporulated clones in liquid sporulation medium and dissected tetrads on solid agar with yeast extract – peptone – dextrose ( YPD ) medium , with a dissec - tion microscope ( MSM , Singer Instruments ) . We constructed most of our clones of S . cerevisiae with specific genes removed or with genes ( at native genomic locus ) encoding C - terminal fluorescent protein fusion proteins by PCR - based methods and homologous recombination , as described ( Longtine et al , 1998 ) . For protein fusions with C - terminal GFP or C - terminal myc epitopes , we used plasmids pFA6a – GFP ( S65T ) kanMX6 or pFA6a – 13 × myc kanMX6 ( Longtine et al , 1998 ) , respectively , as templates for PCR products . For a complete Ctf19 gene removal or removal of 5 0 954 base pairs of Ctf19 , we used plasmid pRS303 ( Sikorski & Hieter , 1989 ) as PCR template . Some of our clones , such as Okp1 _ fl cnn1 D or Okp1 _ cm D cnn1 D , we generated by mating , sporulation in liquid medium and tetrad dissection . For a list of S . cerevisiae clones , see Table EV6 . Clones are available upon request . For analyses of spore viability of tetrad spores from ctf19 _ 1 – 954 D / ctf19 _ 1 – 954 D , ctf19 D / ctf19 D , Okp1 _ fl / Okp1 _ fl or Okp1 _ cm D / Okp1 _ cm D , Okp1 _ cm D nn D / Okp1 _ cm D nn D ( Fig 8D ; Appendix Fig S9G ) , we mated our respective isolated haploid clones , selected diploid clones on solid agar with minimal synthetic complete medium without adenine and without lysine , sporulated a selection of multiple single colonies in liquid medium and dissected tetrads from the sporulation culture . We calculated spore viability ( Fig 8D ) as percentage of the number of viable spores relative to the total number of dissected spores . For vegetative growth assays on solid agar , we serially diluted our mitotically cycling S . cerevisiae clone suspensions to an absor - bance at 600 nm ( A 600 ) of 0 . 4 , in 96 - well plates ( Nunc ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . From this suspension , we sequentially fourfold diluted suspensions with minimal synthetic complete medium row - wise ( Fig 8A and C ; Appendix Fig S9A , B and E ) . We spotted S . cere - visiae suspensions with a sterilized 48 - head metal pinner ( V & P Scientific , Inc . ) . We prepared our solid YPD agar that contained benomyl with a final concentration of 20 l g / ml benomyl ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . We did our growth experiments with S . cerevisiae clones that encode Mad1 fused to an auxin - inducible degron ( Appendix Fig S9E ) on solid yeast - extract peptone ( YEP ) agar with 2 % ( w / v ) raffi - nose and 2 % ( w / v ) galactose , and 1 mM of the synthetic auxin analogue 1 - napthylic acetic acid ( NAA ; Carl Roth ) , similarly as described ( Nishimura et al , 2009 ) . To prepare S . cerevisiae extracts for our Western blot that we show an image in Appendix Fig S9F , we grew cultures in YEP with 2 % ( w / v ) raffinose and 2 % ( w / v ) galactose to an A 600 of 0 . 3 . After the addition of NAA to a concentra - tion of 1 mM , we collected cells from cultures after specific time points ( Appendix Fig S9F ) by centrifugation . Co - immunoprecipitation assays from S . cerevisiae extracts and Western blotting For Western blots that we show images in Fig 7B and Appendix Fig S8B and C , we grew 50 ml cultures of S . cerevisiae clones at 30 ° C , to an A 600 of 0 . 7 – 2 . 3 . For our co - immunoprecipitation experiment that we show Western blot images in Appendix Fig S8E and F , after growing our S . cerevisiae clone cultures to an A 600 of 0 . 4 at 30 ° C , we added nocodazole to a concentration of 15 l g / ml and continued to grow cultures for 2 h 15 min . After collecting S . cerevisiae cells by centrifugation , and storage at (cid:1) 80 ° C , we resuspended cells in 700 l l of a buffer with 25 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM TCEP with protease inhibitors ( Protease inhibitor cocktail set IV ; Calbiochem ) and phosphatase inhibitors . We lysed cells in a Minibeadbeater ( BioSpec Products ) at 4 ° C . We prepared cleared lysates by centrifugation in an Ultracen - trifuge ( Optima Max - XP , Beckmann Coulter ) , at 4 ° C . We coated protein G - coupled magnetic beads ( Dynabeads , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with monoclonal M2 anti - flag antibodies ( F1804 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . We cross - linked antibodies to protein G with ~ 20 mM dimethyl pimelimidate in Na - borate pH 9 . 0 . We blocked Dynabeads with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . We incubated S . cerevisiae extracts with BSA - blocked Dynabead slurry , for ~ 16 – 18 h at 4 ° C . After washing Dynabeads in tubes on a magnet , we denatured The EMBO Journal Vol 36 | No 23 | 2017 ª 2017 The Authors The EMBO Journal RWD domain – peptide interactions at the inner kinetochore Florian Schmitzberger et al 3478 samples with SDS sample buffer at 95 ° C . We transferred proteins from SDS – PAGE gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane . We probed one membrane with monoclonal anti - flag M2 horseradish peroxi - dase ( HRP ) - coupled antibodies ( from mouse ; cat . no : A8592 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . We probed a separate membrane with monoclonal 9e10 anti - myc antibodies ( from mouse ; Covance ) and subsequently with HRP - coupled polyclonal anti - mouse antibodies ( from goat ; Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories ) . We added ECL Western blotting detection reagent ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) as HRP substrate , and recorded chemiluminescence on high - performance chemilumi - nescence film ( Amersham Hyperfilm ECL ) or on a charge - coupled device of an Amersham Imager 600 ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . For our Western blot that we show an image of in Appendix Fig S9F , our protocol was similar ( see our Appendix Supplementary Materials and Methods for details ) . Live cell fluorescence microscopy and image analysis For our imaging , we grew S . cerevisiae clone cultures at 25 ° C or 30 ° C for ~ 16 – 18 h in YPD . For our clones with GFP fusion proteins , with this type of culture , we inoculated liquid minimal synthetic complete medium without tryptophan to an A 600 of ~ 0 . 4 . In this medium , we grew mitotically cycling cells asynchronously for ~ 4 – 5 h at 30 ° C . We prepared cultures of our cells with Nuf2 - mCherry or Bub1 - 3 × GFP analogously in a similar medium with extra adenine ( final concentration : 0 . 21 % ( w / v ) ) . We imaged cells with Okp1 _ fl and Nkp1 - GFP or Nkp2 - GFP , or with Okp1 _ nn Δ and Nkp1 - GFP or Nkp2 - GFP ( see Fig 5C ) , which we had immobilized on coverslips in glass bottom culture dishes ( No . 0 coverglass , 0 . 085 – 0 . 13 mm ; MatTek corporation ) with concanavalin A , by confocal microscopy on an inverted Nikon Ti - E microscope equipped with an Andor AOTF laser combiner and a Yokogawa CSU - X1 spinning disc unit . We recorded fluorescence signals with an EMCCD ( Andor Technol - ogy ) , and controlled acquisition with the Andor IQ3 software ( Andor Technology ) . All our other living S . cerevisiae cells ( see Fig 7C and D ; Appendix Figs S8D and S9C and D ) we imaged , after immobilization as described above , with a DeltaVision ( Applied Precision , GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) wide - field , inverted micro - scope with a Xenon Lamp and a Coolsnap HQ charge - coupled device ( Photometrics ) . We controlled image acquisition and decon - voluted images with softWoRx software ( DeltaVision Applied Precision ) . We analysed and processed our images with Fiji ( Schindelin et al , 2012 ) .
