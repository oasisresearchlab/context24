These tools often skew 18 towards PSPs with a high content of intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) , thus frequently 19 undervaluing potential PSPs without IDRs . Nonetheless , PS is not only steered by IDRs but also 20 by the structured modular domains and interactions that aren ' t necessarily reflected in amino acid 21 sequences . In this work , we introduce PSPire , a unique machine learning predictor designed to 22 incorporate both residue - level and structure - level features for the precise prediction of PSPs . 23 Compared to current PSP predictors , PSPire shows a notable improvement in identifying PSPs 24 without IDRs , which underscores the crucial role of non - IDR , structure - based characteristics in 25 multivalent interactions throughout the PS process . Additionally , our biological validation 26 experiments substantiate the predictive capacity of PSPire , with 6 out of the 8 chosen candidate 27 PSPs confirmed to form condensates within cells . This highlights the considerable potential of 28 structure - based models in the accurate prediction and comprehensive understanding of protein PS . 29 Introduction 30 The intricate regulation of complex biochemical reactions within cells has always been an essential 31 issue . Membrane - bound organelles , surrounded by phospholipid bilayers , physically separate their 32 interior and exterior environments , ensuring a stable reaction environment . However , 33 membraneless organelles ( MLOs ) , such as nucleoli and stress granules , can concentrate proteins 34 and nucleic acids at specific cellular sites without physical boundaries . The formation , composition 35 control , and function regulation of these MLOs have been elusive for years . In 2009 , Brangwynne 36 et al . found that P granules in germ cells from Caenorhabditis elegans can form liquid droplets 1 , 37 suggesting phase separation ( PS ) could underlie the formation of these biomolecular condensates . 38 Subsequent studies implicated PS in various fundamental biological processes like transmembrane 39 signaling 2 , DNA repair 3 , transcription 4 , 5 , and RNA processing 6 . Abnormal formation or disruption 40 of biomolecular condensates can cause neurodegenerative disorders 7 , cancer 8 , 9 , and infectious 41 diseases 10 . 42 A key feature of PS proteins ( PSPs ) is their capacity to form multiple weak , transient , 43 noncovalent interactions . The stickers - and - spacers model offers an intuitive perspective to the 44 driving - force behind PS 11 , 12 . In this model , the stickers represent protein - protein or protein - RNA 45 interaction domains , while the spacers are interspersed between stickers and can modulate PS 46 behavior 13 . A considerable number of PSPs participate into biomolecular condensates via 47 interactions between intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) , which possess highly flexible 48 conformations and present multiple weakly interacting elements . IDRs typically contain more 49 charged and polar amino acids , while often lacking bulky hydrophobic amino acids necessary for 50 forming well - structured domains . In addition to IDRs , another way to achieve multivalent 51 interactions is through modular interaction domains . These domains serve as binding modules and 52 contribute significantly to PS by oligomerizing multiple protein molecules , effectively increasing 53 the number of interaction sites and the multivalency . In this study , we categorized PSPs into two 54 groups : those containing IDRs ( ID - PSPs ) and those without IDRs ( noID - PSPs ) . 55 The development of computational methods for predicting PSPs is crucial for facilitating the 56 rapid in - silico screening of the entire proteome . The initial PSP prediction models focused on 57 specific or limited protein sequence features , utilizing only small subsets of the entire proteome 14 . 58 PLAAC 15 , catGRANULE 16 , PScore 17 , PSPer 18 , and several other methods 19 - 21 belong to this 59 category . In recent years , with the surge in PSP studies 22 , more comprehensive PSP prediction 60 methods were developed , such as FuzDrop 23 , PSAP 24 , PSPredictor 25 , and PhaSePred 26 . These 61 recent methods outperformed their predecessors , mainly due to the usage of larger training datasets 62 and the implementation of machine - learning techniques . Despite these advantages , current PSP 63 predictors severely biased towards predicting ID - PSPs , resulting in subpar performances in 64 predicting noID - PSPs ( see Results for details ) . This bias underscores the prevailing challenge of 65 accurately identifying PSPs without IDRs . 66 As the structures of noID - PSPs may offer insights into the multivalent interactions underlying 67 their functions , we hypothesize that incorporating protein structural information could 68 significantly enhance the prediction of noID - PSPs . Current PSP predictors rely solely on amino 69 acid sequences and do not leverage protein structural information , likely due to the limited 70 availability of high - quality protein structures . Recently , AlphaFold emerged as the top - performing 71 method for predicting 3D protein structures with near - experimental accuracy 27 , and the AlphaFold 72 Protein Structure Database made high - accuracy structure predictions publicly accessible 28 . In this 73 study , leveraging the availability of high - accuracy atomic coordinates of proteins in the full human 74 proteome , we trained a XGBoost classifier , PSPire , to predict PSPs by incorporating both residue - 75 level and structure - level features . We employed the features harboring the top importance to the 76 predictions of two best current predictors , PSAP and PhaSePred , and calculated these features on 77 IDRs and non - IDRs separately . Evaluations using various datasets demonstrated that our model 78 significantly outperformed current predictors in classifying noID - PSPs from non - PSPs , 79 highlighting the significant value of protein structural information in decoding the multivalency 80 involved in PS . 81 Results 82 Current PSPs predictors struggle to accurately predict noID - PSPs 83 As evidences suggested that several initial PSP prediction models exhibit heavy bias towards 84 proteins with high IDR contents 29 , we hypothesized that the current PSP predictors might be less 85 effective in predicting noID - PSPs . To verify our suspicion , we assessed the performances of 86 representative PSP predictors ( including PhaSePred , PSPredictor , PSAP , FuzDrop , PSPer , PScore , 87 catGRANULE , and PLAAC ) on separate ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs testing dataset ( see Methods 88 for details ) . The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUROC ) and the area 89 under the precision - recall curve ( AUPRC ) revealed that these predictors were quite effective in 90 distinguishing ID - PSPs from non - PSPs ( best AUROC = 0 . 84 , best AUPRC = 0 . 42 ) . However , 91 their ability to predict noID - PSPs was significantly lower ( best AUROC = 0 . 68 , best AUPRC = 92 0 . 08 ) ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , highlighting the ongoing challenge of accurately 93 identifying PSPs that do not contain IDRs . 94 To understand why current predictors were less effective in predicting noID - PSPs , we 95 investigated the features employed in PSAP and PhaSePred , which are considered the best 96 performers among current PSP predictors . PSAP utilized a set of elaborately designed amino acid 97 features associated with PS , out of which we analyzed the 10 most impactful ones by comparing 98 their values among ID - PSPs , noID - PSPs , and non - PSPs in our testing dataset . Interestingly , only 99 the “fraction _ L” feature ( i . e . , the fraction of leucine in the whole protein sequence ) was able to 100 simultaneously distinguish ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs from non - PSPs . Seven features demonstrated 101 opposing tendencies for ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs . For example , the “IDR _ 50” feature ( i . e . , IDR 102 percentage with an IDR score cutoff of 0 . 5 ) showed higher values for ID - PSPs compared to non - 103 PSPs and lower values for noID - PSPs compared to non - PSPs . The remaining two features 104 ( “fraction _ C” , i . e . , the fraction of cysteine in the whole protein sequence , and “group _ Xle” , i . e . , 105 the fraction of Xle group which includes leucine and isoleucine ) did not show statistically 106 significant difference between noID - PSPs and non - PSPs ( Fig . 1b ) . Similarly , when examining the 107 six features used by PhaSePred , comparable trends were observed ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Only 108 two features ( “phos _ frequency” , i . e . , the phosphorylation frequency , and “group _ Charged” , i . e . , 109 the fraction of charged group which includes D , E , R , and K ) was able to simultaneously 110 distinguish ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs from non - PSPs . Taken together , it appears that most features 111 employed by current PSP predictors do not favor noID - PSPs , which explains their subpar 112 performance in predicting noID - PSPs . This observation underscores the need for utilizing new 113 features suitable for the accurate prediction of noID - PSPs . 114 Structured superficial features enable identification of both ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs 115 Considering that noID - PSPs lack IDRs , we aimed to identify IDR - independent features that can 116 effectively distinguish both ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs from non - PSPs . As each residue in a protein 117 can either be buried within the protein structure or exposed to the surrounding solvent , and that 118 exposed residues are often implicated in interactions with other proteins or ligands , we 119 hypothesized that residues of structured superficial regions ( SSUP ) of PSPs might play a 120 significant role in the multivalency involved in PS . To explore this hypothesis , we identified SSUP 121 for each protein in our testing dataset by using AlphaFold - predicted 3D structures ( Fig . 2a ; see 122 Methods for details ) . Among the most impactful features from PSAP and PhaSePred ( Fig . 1b , 123 Supplementary Fig . 1b ) , eight of them could be calculated based on residues of SSUP . As the 124 definition of SSUP intrinsically excludes IDRs , these features derived from SSUP residues can be 125 considered as IDR - independent . Surprisingly , in contrast to the unfavorable full - length protein 126 features for noID - PSPs , all of the SSUP features could concurrently differentiate ID - PSPs and 127 noID - PSPs from non - PSPs ( Fig . 2b ) . For example , the “group _ Hydrophobic” feature ( i . e . , the 128 fraction of hydrophobic group which includes V , I , L , F , W , Y and M ) of the full - length protein 129 displayed opposing tendencies for ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs ( Fig . 1b ) , whereas the same feature 130 derived from SSUP demonstrated similar tendencies for ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs ( Fig . 2b ) . This 131 observation emphasized that SSUP residues directly contribute to PS , and features derived from 132 SSUP could be utilized for the accurate prediction of both ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs . 133 To further elucidate the role of SSUP residues in PS , we explored the stickers - and - spacers 134 model in the specific context of SSUP . Considering that electrostatic interactions between 135 positively and negatively charged residues are a well - studied bases for sticker interactions 136 contributing to PS behavior , we designed a computational approach for the identification of 137 charged stickers , i . e . , clusters of similarly charged residues interspersed on SSUP ( Fig . 2c ; see 138 Methods for details ) . For our approach , we tested a range of distances from 10 Å to 20 Å and chose 139 14 Å as the threshold where the fraction of proteins with ≥ 3 stickers in the whole human proteome 140 reached the maximum ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ; see Methods for details ) . As PS have been reported 141 to be mediated by electrostatic interactions between the disordered N - terminus and the coiled - coil 142 domain 30 , LINE - 1 ORF1 protein was shown as an example of calculated stickers ( Fig . 2d ) . By 143 applying our approach , we identified stickers for each protein in our testing dataset . We observed 144 that the proportion of proteins with ≥ 3 stickers was higher in both ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs 145 compared to non - PSPs ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Moreover , considering that the presence of both 146 positively and negatively charged stickers could promote the formation of electrostatic interactions 147 between proteins , we further calculated the number of sticker pairs for each protein , i . e . , the 148 minimum number of the positively and negatively charged stickers . We found that the proportion 149 of proteins with ≥ 2 sticker pairs was higher in ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs than in non - PSPs 150 ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . To eliminate the differences in the number of SSUP residues , we 151 calculated normalized values for sticker number and sticker pair number , and compared these 152 values among ID - PSPs , noID - PSPs , and non - PSPs , revealing that both normalized values for ID - 153 PSPs and noID - PSPs were significantly higher than those of non - PSPs ( Fig . 2e ) . This supported 154 that SSUP residues have the potential to mediate PS via the stickers - and - spacers model . 155 Development and performance evaluation of PSPire 156 In order to leverage the distinct features observed on SSUP for both ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs 157 compared to non - PSPs , we aimed to develop a high - accuracy machine learning classifier that could 158 effectively distinguish both ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs from non - PSPs by integrating these features . 159 In addition to the aforementioned SSUP features , we calculated corresponding features on IDRs 160 since PS of many ID - PSPs is dependent on IDRs , and these IDR - related features were null for 161 proteins without IDRs . Besides , we also incorporated the phosphorylation ( Phos ) frequency 162 feature , using Phos sites of human proteins from PhosphoSitePlus 31 , which has been demonstrated 163 to be IDR - independent and harbored the leading contribution to the prediction of PhaSePred 26 . By 164 incorporating the IDR - and SSUP - related features along with the Phos frequency feature 165 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , we designed a XGBoost predictor of PSPs , named PSPire , based on a 166 combination of residue - level and structure - level features to predict PS propensity for both ID - PSPs 167 and noID - PSPs ( Fig . 3 ; see Methods for details ) . As Phos sites recorded in PhosphoSitePlus are 168 sparse for species other than human , we trained models with the Phos feature for predicting PSPs 169 in human , while trained models without the Phos feature for predicting PSPs for other species . We 170 utilized the model interpreter SHAP on ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs separately to measure the 171 contribution of each feature . The Phos frequency feature got the highest averaged absolute SHAP 172 score in both cases . As expected , besides the Phos feature , three features calculated on IDRs 173 ( “group _ Charged _ idr” , i . e . , the fraction of charged group which includes K , R , D and E in IDRs , 174 “fraction _ C _ idr” , i . e . , the fraction of cysteine in IDRs , and “IDR percentage” ) exhibited top 175 importance for ID - PSPs prediction , while the top - ranked three features for noID - PSPs prediction 176 were calculated on SSUP ( “group _ Alpha _ helix _ ssup” , i . e . , the fraction of alpha helix group which 177 includes V , I , Y , F , W and L in SSUP , “fraction _ C _ ssup” , i . e . , the fraction of cysteine in SSUP , 178 and “group _ Charged _ ssup” , i . e . , the fraction of charged group in SSUP ) ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . 179 We evaluated the performance of PSPire in predicting noID - PSPs and ID - PSPs on the human 180 testing dataset ( see Methods for details ) . The performance of PSPire for ID - PSPs prediction 181 ( AUROC : 0 . 85 , AUPRC : 0 . 47 ; Fig . 4a , b ) was comparable to the top current predictors ( AUROC : 182 0 . 84 , AUPRC : 0 . 42 ; Fig . 1a , Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Notably , PSPire demonstrated superior 183 performance for noID - PSPs prediction ( AUROC : 0 . 84 , AUPRC : 0 . 19 ; Fig . 4a , b ) in constrast to 184 the best current predictors ( AUROC : 0 . 68 , AUPRC : 0 . 08 ; Fig . 1a , Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Given 185 the scarcity of in vivo or in vitro confirmed PSPs , we further evaluated the performance of PSPire 186 using 4 human datasets annotating proteome in MLOs , since proteins in MLOs are potential PSPs 187 ( see Methods for details ) . As shown in Fig . 4c , PSPire performed comparably to the best current 188 predictors in predicting ID - PSPs across all four datasets , yet it demonstrated significantly better 189 performance for noID - PSPs prediction . In summary , the results showed that PSPire remarkably 190 outperforms current predictors in distinguishing noID - PSPs from non - PSPs . 191 Validation of candidate PSPs predicted by PSPire 192 To systematically predict candidate human PSPs , we ultimately trained PSPire using the 193 combination of training and testing datasets and utilized it to assign the PS scores to all human 194 proteins ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . The proteins were then ranked based on their PS scores , and 195 those ranked within the top 1 , 500 but not present in training dataset or MLOs were considered as 196 highly confident PSP candidates , whereas those ranked between top 1 , 500 and 3 , 000 were termed 197 as moderately confident candidates . In total , 111 highly confident ID - PSP candidates , 115 highly 198 confident noID - PSP candidates , 425 moderately confident ID - PSP candidates , and 288 moderately 199 confident noID - PSP candidates were identified ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Among the PSP 200 candidates , 120 proteins were predicted as candidate PSPs by DeepPhase 32 , a predictor based on 201 immunofluorescence images from the Human Protein Atlas . Besides , the mouse orthologs of 73 202 PSP candidates have been reported as PSPs . Additionally , four ID - PSP candidates have been 203 recently reported to exhibit the ability to undergo PS , including TNS1 33 , p130Cas 34 , FAK 34 , and 204 IRS - 1 35 . MAPK14 ( also known as p38MAPKα ) , a noID - PSP candidate , was newly identified as a 205 member of viral infection - related biomolecular condensates 36 . These evidences suggested the 206 reliablility of candidates predicted by PSPire . 207 To substantiate the reliability of PSPire ' s predictions , we conducted further biological 208 experiments to authenticate the PS propensity of the candidate PSPs . With PSPire ' s robust 209 prediction capacity for noID - PSPs , we chose three highly confident noID - PSP candidates 210 ( ANXA3 , S100A7 , and PGM1 ) and three moderately confident ones ( CKMT2 , TXNL4B , and 211 SerpinB4 ) for validation . Additionally , we selected two ID - PSP candidates ( Rab31 and VPS26B ) , 212 which were predicted as noID - PSPs by ESpritz 37 and MobiDB - lite 38 , with PS scores akin to the 213 moderately confident candidates when IDR - related features were null . AlphaFold - predicted 3D 214 structures of the eight chosen proteins can be seen in Supplementary Fig . 4 . 215 To gauge cellular localization of these proteins under standard conditions , we conducted 216 immunostaining of these endogenous proteins in HeLa cells . PGM1 , TXNL4B , SerpinB4 , and 217 VPS26B emerged as small cytoplasmic puncta within cells ( Fig . 5a ) . Interestingly , these four 218 proteins ' condensates co - localized with EDC4 , a known P - body marker , hinting at their role in P - 219 body assembly ( Fig . 5a ) . S100A7 and Rab31 , although dispersed in HeLa cell cytoplasm 220 ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) , co - localized with cytoplasmic stress granules under sodium arsenite - 221 induced stress ( Fig . 5b ) . No puncta were observed for ANXA3 and CKMT2 . 222 These cellular findings affirm that 6 out of 8 selected candidates can form condensates within 223 cells . To further validate these proteins ' independent in vitro PS , we obtained purified full - length 224 proteins of PGM1 , SerpinB4 , S100A7 , and Rab31 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Introducing crowding 225 agent PEG 3350 led to the formation of typical spherical liquid droplets by PGM1 , SerpinB4 , and 226 Rab31 - a key PSP trait . Similarly , S100A7 underwent PS in the presence of another crowding 227 agent , PEG 8000 ( Fig . 5c ) . Collectively , these results verify these proteins ' strong PS propensity , 228 reinforcing the efficacy of PSPire . 229 Discussion 230 The burgeoning understanding of proteins and their biological functions through the formation of 231 biomolecular condensates emphasizes the importance of accurate PSP predictors . PSP predictors 232 could allow researchers to identify PSP candidates from the proteome , thereby expediting our 233 comprehension of the PS process . In this study , we developed PSPire , a machine learning model 234 developed to predict PS propensities based on the integration of residue - level and structure - level 235 features . Unlike current predictors that primarily rely on amino acid features , PSPire integrates 3D 236 structural information , demonstrating superior performance in identifying noID - PSPs . This 237 advancement suggests a strong correlation between non - IDR features based on structured 238 superficial regions and the multivalent nature underlying the PS process of structural domain - 239 driving proteins . Consequently , PSPire effectively identified PSP candidates and could benefit our 240 understanding of these proteins and their role in condensate formation . Furthermore , it is well - 241 understood that PS of many proteins is facilitated by electrostatic interactions between positively 242 and negatively charged patches ( i . e . , stickers ) on the structured exposed surface . Leveraging this 243 important feature , PSPire reported the residue positions of these stickers as output , which could be 244 valuable for further experimental validation and has the potential to aid in the identification of 245 drug targets related to PS . 246 While PSPire ' s performance is exemplary , it does face several challenges . First , despite 247 AlphaFold ' s near - experimental precision in predicting 3D protein structures from amino acid 248 sequences 39 , discrepancies can arise between the AlphaFold - predicted and native structures . For 249 instance , AlphaFold predicts the structure of α - Syn to comprise an N - terminal α - helix domain and 250 a C - terminal IDR , whereas its native structure has three unstructured domains . Given that protein 251 structures significantly contribute to calculating structured superficial regions , the performance of 252 PSPire hinges on the accuracy of its predicted structure . We expect enhancements in prediction 253 performance as more precise protein structures become available . Second , the current 254 classification between ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs is based on the presence of IDRs . Nevertheless , 255 the PS of certain ID - PSPs predominantly hinges on modular domains rather than IDRs . A case in 256 point is JAK1 , a recognized ID - PSP , which can form a PS - driven CNF1 - JAK1 - JAK2 complex via 257 its SH2 domain 40 . With PSPire ' s default features , the PS score of JAK1 is a mere 0 . 43 . To tackle 258 the issue that IDR - related features may inadvertently impair prediction , PSPire offers a parameter 259 to specifically ignore IDR - related features for proteins with IDRs . Consequently , when JAK1 ' s 260 IDR - related features are nullified , its PS score increases to 0 . 91 . 261 Methods 262 Datasets 263 In this study , datasets used for development of the PhaSePred 26 model were obtained , which 264 contained 155 PSPs and 8 , 801 non - PSPs for training , and 117 PSPs and 2 , 200 non - PSPs for 265 testing . Then a total of 189 additional PSPs were retrieved from LLPSDB 41 , PhaSePro 42 , 266 PhaSepDB 43 , and DrLLPS 44 , which were validated by in vivo or in vitro experiments . Besides , 77 267 noID - PSPs classified as scaffolds and regulators by DrLLPS were included . Since proteins longer 268 than 2 , 700 amino acids were segmented into overlapping fragments by AlphaFold , proteins with 269 a sequence length ≤ 100 and ≥ 2 , 700 amino acids were filtered out . As PSPer 18 , PScore 17 , and 270 PLAAC 15 have restrictions on the length of protein sequences , proteins that cannot be predicted 271 by these three tools were also filtered out . Then the ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs were both randomly 272 split into separate training and testing datasets with a ratio of 1 : 1 and the traning PSPs of 273 PhaSePred were reserved in training dataset . Consequently , the positive training dataset comprised 274 259 PSPs , including 195 ID - PSPs and 64 noID - PSPs ; the positive testing dataset consisted of 258 275 PSPs with 194 ID - PSPs and 64 noID - PSPs ; and the negative training and testing datasets contained 276 8 , 323 and 1 , 961 proteins , respectively ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Furthermore , four human MLO 277 datasets were collected for evaluation : the G3BP1 proximity labelling set 26 , 45 , the RNAgranuleDB 278 Tier1 set 46 , the PhaSepDB low and high throughput MLO set 43 , and the DrLLPS MLO set 44 279 ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . 280 Secondary structure calculation 281 The secondary structure state of each residue was calculated by Definition of Secondary Structure 282 of Proteins ( DSSP ) 47 , 48 using AlphaFold Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) coordinate files . The DSSP 283 module from the Biopython package was used as an interface to the DSSP program . The resulting 284 secondary structure assignments contained eight types : α - helix ( H ) , 3 - helix ( G ) , 5 helix ( I ) , β - 285 bridge ( B ) , β ladder ( E ) , bend ( S ) , turn ( T ) and irregular . These types were further grouped into 286 three categories : helix ( H , G , and I ) , sheet ( B and E ) , and loop ( S , T , and irregular ) . 287 Intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) calculation 288 The amino acid sequence and pLDDT scores of each protein were extracted from PDB files of 289 AlphaFold - predicted protein structures using the PDB and SeqIO modules from the Biopython 290 package . To identify long disordered regions , IDRs were assigned based on pLDDT scores using 291 a threshold of 50 ( i . e . , a residues with a score lower than 50 were considered as disordered ) . Then 292 residues annotated as helix or sheet secondary structures by the DSSP program 47 , 48 were filtered 293 out from IDRs . As carried out by MobiDB - lite 38 , the IDRs were further refined by iteratively 294 converting short stretches of up to three residues of IDRs among ordered regions to order , and vice 295 versa . Ordered stretches of up to 10 consecutive residues were then converted to IDRs if they were 296 flanked by two IDRs of at least 20 residues . Finally , IDRs with a sequence length below 20 were 297 removed . 298 Structural superficial regions ( SSUP ) determination 299 Relative solvent accessible surface area ( RSA ) is defined as the per - residue ratio between solvent 300 accessible surface area ( SASA ) and the ‘standard’ value for a particular residue . In this study , we 301 used the PSAIA program 49 to calculate RSA . First , we grouped the residues based on a threshold 302 value of RSA . If the RSA percentage of a residue was greater than 25 % , it was assigned as an 303 exposed residue ; otherwise , it was classified as a buried residue . Further , all exposed residues were 304 classified as the superficial group ( SUP group ) , and the non - IDRs were regarded as structural 305 group ( S group ) . Finally , the structural superficial regions ( SSUP ) were generated by overlapping 306 the S group and SUP group . 307 Sticker - related features 308 To obtain sticker - related features , we first calculated the net charge index of each residue in SSUP . 309 The net charge index of a residue was defined as the number of positive residues in SSUP minus 310 the number of negative residues in SSUP within a defined distance of the residue . We tested a 311 range of distances from 10 Å to 20 Å . The proximate residues were searched using the PyMOL 312 python package as an interface to the PyMOL software 50 . We then obtained a group of residues 313 whose absolute value of the net charge index was greater than three . Next , we implemented the 314 hierarchical clustering of the group of residues using the Python scipy package based on Cα 3D 315 coordinates of each residue , which were extracted from AlphaFold PDB files . The parameters used 316 were : t = 15 , criterion = distance , metric = Euclidean , method = centroid . Further , if the net charge 317 index of the majority of residues was positive ( negative ) , the cluster was classified as a positive 318 ( negative ) cluster . Finally , the total sticker number was defined as the sum of the positive and 319 negative cluster number , while the sticker pair number was defined as the minimum value of the 320 positive and negative cluster number . The final two features of sticker frequency and sticker pair 321 frequency were defined as the the total sticker number and sticker pair number divided by the 322 residue number in SSUP . 323 IDR and SSUP related features 324 Firstly , amino acids were classified into various groups according to different properties . The 325 combinations included Xle ( I , L ) , Aliphatic ( V , I , L , M ) , Hydrophobic ( V , I , L , F , W , Y , M ) , Alpha 326 helix ( V , I , Y , F , W , L ) , and Charged ( K , R , D , E ) . The hydropathy value was allocated to each 327 residue , which was calculated using the same method as in localCIDER 51 based on a normalized 328 Kyte - Doolittle hydrophobicity scale 52 . Then the following features employed by PSAP and 329 PhaSePred were calculated on IDRs and SSUP separately : fraction of lysine and cysteine ; 330 proportion of the Xle , Aliphatic , Hydrophobic , Alpha helix , and Charged groups ; averaged 331 hydropathy score . Besides , the sequence length of IDRs and sequence length percentage of IDRs 332 in a protein were added . Lastly , the phosphorylation ( Phos ) frequency feature was calculated using 333 the same definition as PhaSePred , i . e . , the number of Phos sites retrieved from PhosphoSitePlus 31 334 divided by the length of the protein sequence . 335 Model training and performance evaluation 336 The features data was normalized by scaling using the MinMaxScaler from Scikit - learn . We 337 utilized a tree - based ensemble learning method , XGBoost , to train the classifier for distinguishing 338 between PSPs and non - PSPs . The default parameters were used to prevent model overfitting . 339 During the XGBoost model fitting process , sample weights were assigned to ID - PSPs , noID - PSPs 340 and non - PSPs in the training dataset based on the inverse of frequencies of each type . Two separate 341 models with and without the Phos frequency feature were trained . During the training process , we 342 performed ten rounds of training . For each round , the positive training dataset remained fixed and 343 ten models were generated with ten different negative training subsets . These negative subsets 344 were randomly sampled from the negative training dataset , ensuring that the number of proteins in 345 the negative training subsets was twice the number of proteins in the positive training dataset . The 346 final prediction score of a protein was calculated as the average prediction score from these ten 347 models . For better comparison , we re - trained the PSAP model on the same training dataset with 348 the same strategy . 349 The prediction was evaluated using the independent testing dataset . The model ' s performance 350 was assessed by the area under the curve ( AUC ) of the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) 351 curve and the precision - recall ( PRC ) curve . For the final model , the training and testing positive 352 datasets were merged , as were the training and testing negative datasets . The same ten - round 353 training procedure was applied to the merged datasets , and the averaged prediction score of the ten 354 trained models was used as the PS score for each protein . A random seed of 42 was used 355 consistently throughout the process to ensure reproducibility . 356 Cell cultures and immunofluorescence 357 Hela cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( 11995073 , Gibco ) supplemented 358 with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( 10099141 , Gibco ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( 15140122 , 359 Gibco ) at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . For immunostaining , cells were grown on coverslips pre - coated with 360 poly - L - Lysine ( PLL ) in a 24 - well plate . After being washed with PBS , the cells were fixed in 361 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature . Following fixation , the cells were 362 permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15 min and blocked with 3 % goat serum in 363 PBST ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ) for 30 min . Next , the cells were incubated with primary 364 antibodies overnight at 4 °C , followed by the incubation with secondary antibodies at room 365 temperature for 1 h . After being washed three times with PBST , the cells were mounted on glass 366 slides using the antifade mountant with DAPI ( P36962 , Thermo Fisher ) . For sodium arsenite 367 treatment , cells were incubated with culture medium containing 250 µM sodium arsenite for 1 h 368 before harvesting . Imaging was performed using a Leica TCS SP8 microscope with a 100 × 369 objective ( oil immersion , NA = 1 . 4 ) at room temperature . 370 The following antibodies were used for immunofluorescence assays : rabbit anti - PGM1 371 ( abs117064 , absin ) , rabbit anti - SerpinB4 ( abs134793 , absin ) , rabbit anti - S100A7 ( abs139303 , 372 absin ) , rabbit anti - TXNL4B ( abs117670 , absin ) , rabbit anti - Rab31 ( abs134703 , absin ) , rabbit anti - 373 VPS26B ( absin134908 , absin ) , mouse anti - G3BP ( 611127 , BD Biosciences , ) , mouse anti - EDC4 374 ( sc - 376382 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . The following fluorescent secondary antibodies were 375 used : goat anti - rabbit - Alexa Flour 488 ( Invitrogen , A - 11008 ) , goat anti - mouse - Alexa Flour 568 376 ( Invitrogen , A - 11004 ) . 377 Protein expression and purification 378 The genes of full length Rab31 , S100A7 , SerpinB4 , and PGM1 were synthesized by AZENTA . 379 These genes were then inserted into the pET - 28a vector , which contained an N - tetminal His 6 - tag 380 and a thrormbin cleavage site . The S100A7 , Serpin B4 , and PGM1 plasmids were transformed into 381 BL21 ( DE3 ) Chemically Competent Cell ( CD601 - 03 , TransGenBiotech ) . As for the Rab31 382 plasmid , the Transetta ( DE3 ) Chemically Competent Cell ( CD801 - 02 , TransGenBiotech ) was 383 used . Cells were grown to an OD 600 of 0 . 8 and induced with 0 . 5 mM IPTG overnight at 16 °C . 384 Proteins were loaded onto the HisTrap FF column ( GE Healthcare ) with buffer containing 50 mM 385 Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , and 10 % glycerol . The proteins were eluted with imidazole and 386 then further purified using a size exclusion column . The Rab31 , S100A7 , and SerpinB4 proteins 387 were purified using a Superdex 75 26 / 60 column ( GE Healthcare ) , while the PGM1 protein was 388 purified using a Superdex 200 16 / 300 column ( GE Healthcare ) . The purified proteins were stored 389 in buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , and 10 % glycerol at - 80 °C . 390 Differential interference contrast imaging 391 For DIC observation , the purified proteins were diluted in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris and 150 392 mM NaCl at pH 7 . 5 , to achieve a final concentration of 50 µM . To induce phase separation ( PS ) 393 of Rab31 , PGM1 , and SerpinB4 , 15 % ( w / v ) PEG 3350 was added to the system . For the PS of 394 S100A7 , 10 % ( w / v ) PEG 8000 was used . Once PS was induced in the tube , 3 µL of the solution 395 was pipetted onto a glass slide for DIC imaging . The images were collected using a Leica TCS 396 SP8 microscope with a 100x objective ( oil immersion , NA = 1 . 4 ) at room temperature . 397 Visualization and statistical analysis 398 All plotting and statistical analyses were implemented in Python or R . When applicable , multiple 399 test corrections were carried out using the Benjamini - Hochberg ( BH ) correction method . P - values 400 were calculated using the Wilcoxon signed - rank test and were indicated in figures as follows : ns 401 ( not significant ) for p > 0 . 05 , * for p < 0 . 05 , * * for p < 0 . 01 , * * * for p < 0 . 001 , and * * * * for p < 402 0 . 0001 . The graphical representations of proteins were generated using PyMOL 50 or UCSF 403 Chimera 53 software . 404 Data availability 405 All datasets analyzed in this study are publicly available ( see Methods for details ) . 406 Code availability 407 PSPire is freely available as a python package at https : / / github . com / TongjiZhanglab / PSPire . 408 Acknowledgements 409 We thank Guohui Chuai for his helpful advice .

Performance of current PSP predictors on ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs . a , Receiver operating 539 characteristic curves ( ROC ) of eight predictors on the testing dataset . The performance was evaluated on ID - 540 PSPs and noID - PSPs separately . The PhaSePred tool includes two models : SaPS and PdPS . b , Comparison of 541 ten PS - related features that attribute the highest importance to PSAP prediction between the two types of PSPs 542 ( ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs ) and non - PSPs . The amino acid groups include Xle ( L , I ) , Aliphatic ( V , I , L , M ) , 543 Hydrophobic ( V , I , L , F , W , Y , M ) , and Alpha helix ( V , I , Y , F , W , L ) . The ten features calculated on the whole 544 protein sequence are : fraction _ C ( i . e . , the fraction of cysteine ) , fraction _ L ( i . e . , the fraction of leucine ) , IDR _ 50 545 ( i . e . , IDR percentage with an IDR score cutoff of 0 . 5 ) , IDR _ 60 ( i . e . , IDR percentage with an IDR score cutoff 546 of 0 . 6 ) , IDR _ percentage ( i . e . , IDR length with an IDR score cutoff of 0 . 5 ) , the proportion of the four amino acid 547 groups , and low complexity score . 548 549 Figure 2 . Features calculated on structured superficial regions ( SSUP ) . a , Schematic view of SSUP 550 calculation . Intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) of a protein were first determined based on AlphaFold 551 structures . The protein was then divided into IDRs and structured regions ( non - IDRs ) . Lastly , the residues in the 552 non - IDRs with a relative solvent accessibility ( RSA ) value greater than 25 % constituted the SSUP . b , 553 Comparison of eight SSUP - related features between the two types of PSPs ( ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs ) and non - 554 PSPs . The amino acid groups include Xle ( L , I ) , Aliphatic ( V , I , L , M ) , Hydrophobic ( V , I , L , F , W , Y , M ) , and 555 Alpha helix ( V , I , Y , F , W , L ) , and Charged ( K , R , D , E ) . The eight features calculated on SSUP are : 556 fraction _ C _ ssup ( i . e . , the fraction of cysteine ) , fraction _ L _ ssup ( i . e . , the fraction of leucine ) , the proportion of 557 the five amino acid groups , and hydropathy _ ssup ( i . e . , hydropathy score ) . c , Schematic view of stickers 558 calculation . First , the net charge index of each residue in SSUP within a defined distance was calculated . Then , 559 a group of residues with an absolute value of the net charge index greater than three were collected . Lastly , 560 hierarchical clustering was performed on the group of residues to obtain positive and negative clusters . d , 561 Graphical representation of charged stickers in SSUP . The example shown is the LINE - 1 ORF1 protein . The left 562 panel displays the 3D structure of three domains : the coiled - coil domain , the RNA recognition motif ( RRM ) , 563 and the C - terminal domain ( CTD ) . The middle panel presents the protein surface of the coiled - coil domain 564 colored by Coulombic electrostatic potential . The right panel shows the calculated stickers of the coiled - coil 565 domain using our algorithm . e , Comparison of two SSUP - related features between the two types of PSPs ( ID - 566 PSPs and noID - PSPs ) and non - PSPs : sticker _ ssup ( i . e . , sticker frequency ) , and sticker _ pair _ ssup ( i . e . , sticker 567 pair frequency ) . 568 569 Figure 3 . Schematic workflow of PSPire . The training dataset contained three types of proteins : two types of 570 PSPs ( ID - PSPs and noID - PSPs ) and non - PSPs . IDR and SSUP related features were calculated for all proteins 571 in the training dataset . A XGBoost classifier was then constructed using these features . For a query protein , 572 PSPire can output the PS score which denote the likelihood of phase separation and the protein type which 573 indicate whether the protein contains IDRs . 574 575 Figure 4 . Performance benchmarking of PSPire against current PSP predictors . a and b , Performance of 576 PSPire on the testing dataset assessed by ROC and PRC curves . The performance was evaluated on ID - PSPs and 577 noID - PSPs separately . c , AUCs of ROC and PRC for PSPire and eight predictors on four human MLO datasets : 578 the G3BP1 proximity labelling set , the RNAgranuleDB Tier1 set , the PhaSepDB low and high throughput MLO 579 set , and the DrLLPS MLO set . The PhaSePred tool includes two models : SaPS and PdPS . AUC values are 580 calculated by using ID - PSPs or noID - PSPs in these datasets as positive samples and proteins in the negative 581 testing dataset as negative samples .
