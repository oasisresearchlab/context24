1072 Biochemical Society Transactions ( 2009 ) Volume 37 , part 5 The role of vesicle trafﬁcking in epithelial cell motility Sarah J . Fletcher and Joshua Z . Rappoport 1 School of Biosciences , University of Birmingham , Edgbaston , Birmingham B15 2TT , U . K . Abstract Cell motility is important for many physiological and pathological processes including organ development , wound healing , cancer metastasis and correct immune responses . In particular , epithelial wound healing is both a medically relevant topic and a common experimental model . Mechanisms underlying generation of a polarized cell and maintenance of a motile phenotype during steady - state migration are not well understood . Polarized trafﬁcking of bulk membrane and cell adhesion molecules has been implicated in regulation of cell motility . The present review focuses on the role of different trafﬁcking pathways in epithelial cell migration , including clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolar endocytosis , exocytosis of biosynthetic cargo , ‘short - loop’ and ‘long - loop’ endosomal recycling . Background The process of migration involves both generation of a motile phenotype and its continuance for steady - state migration . Establishment and maintenance of the migratory phenotype is complex , involving co - ordination of multiple subcellular processes . Depending on cell type , migration can be either collective , with cells maintaining cell – cell interactions ( i . e . in wound healing ) , or individual , such as in cancer meta - stasis . Movement involves extension of dynamic membrane protrusions in the direction of migration , formation and disassembly of focal adhesions , extensive reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and reorientation of the Golgi and microtubule organizing centre [ 1 – 3 ] . The present review is an amalgamation of information from a variety of systems , with a particular focus on epithelial wound healing . Cell migration Many mammalian cells are capable of migration in response to a variety of physiological and pharmacological stimuli . For cell migration to occur , sensing of a migratory stimulus is required . A physical stimulus such as wound formation or shear stress is capable of inducing epithelial cell migration , whereas in the process of chemotaxis , migration is stimulated within a chemical gradient . On sensing a migratory stimulus , morphological changes occur , leading to generation of an elongated polarized phenotype . Initial stages of polarization require actin polymerization at the leading edge , generating a protrusive force [ 4 ] . This localized actin polymerization is partially regulated by several Rho GTPases and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ) [ 3 , 5 ] , Keywords : cellmigration , cellmotility , endocytosis , endosomalrecycling , epithelialcell , vesicle trafﬁcking .

New membrane extensions develop attachments with the substratum known as focal complexes [ 6 ] , which mature into focal adhesions [ 7 ] . Thick cables of actin stress fibres regulate and maintain tension on the axis of the cell . Stress fibre contraction leads to retraction of the trailing edge and is regulated by Rho GTPases , Rho kinase , myosin light - chain phosphorylation and interactions with myosin II [ 8 ] . Retrac - tion and focal adhesion disassembly are critical for steady - state migration . These processes require tight regulation for directed migration to occur ( for a full review , see [ 9 ] ) . Vesicle trafﬁcking Vesicles are membrane - bound carriers that transport cargo between cellular compartments . Endocytic recycling is initiated when lipids , membrane proteins and soluble ligands are internalized from the cell surface . Once inside the cell body , endocytic cargo is either recycled via intracellular organelles and returned to the plasma membrane or targeted for degradation . Both internalization and subsequent vesicle trafficking pathways are important for correct signalling and protein targeting . Although it is widely accepted that vesicle traffickingisarequirementforcellmigration [ 10 , 11 ] , thereare conflicting opinions as to the function of each vesicle traffick - ing pathway in cell polarization and steady - state migration . This inconsistency could be due to the use of a range of cell types . It is plausible that some trafficking pathways may play amorepivotalroleinmigrationofsomecelltypesthanothers . Several hypotheses regarding the function of vesicle trafficking in cell migration have been made . Two proposed mechanisms of trafficking of either bulk membrane or indi - vidual cargo proteins / lipids have been suggested [ 12 ] : first , a model implicating internalization occurring throughout the plasma membrane ; and a second where internalization takes place primarily at the rear of the cell . Both models culminate in polarized exocytic trafficking of internalized cargo to C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2009 Biochemical Society Biochem . Soc . Trans . ( 2009 ) 37 , 1072 – 1076 ; doi : 10 . 1042 / BST0371072 The Dynamic Cell 1073 the leading edge , thereby supplying the necessary molecular machinery for continued migration . There has been much support for the latter model [ 13 , 14 ] . However , other studies suggest models where internalization occurs away from the lagging edge [ 15 ] . Whether these differences in internalization site are cell specific , artefacts of differing methods or dependent on migratory stimulus is currently unknown . We are especially interested in the role of vesicle traffick - ing pathways in cell migration . In particular , the trafficking pathways we are concerned with all intersect with the plasma membrane and have been implicated in cell migration . Specifically we are examining clathrin - mediated and caveolar endocytosis , long - loop and short - loop recycling and the biosynthetic secretory pathway in models of epithelial wound healing . Endocytosis Internalization of plasma membrane molecules by endo - cytosis is integral for correct cellular function . Endocytosis is a mechanism in which the plasma membrane lipid bilayer undergoes invagination followed by fission , forming cytoplasmic vesicles that then fuse with internal organelles , delivering cargo targeted for recycling or degradation [ 2 ] . The most widely studied mechanism of endocytosis is CME ( clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) . Regulation of surface density and activity of many types of plasma membrane proteins involves CME [ 2 ] . Several APs ( adaptor proteins ) are required for CCP ( clathrin - coated pit ) formation , recognizing internalization motifs in cargo , recruiting the assembly of clathrin - triskelia into lattices , vesicle membrane curvature and regulating fission [ 15 , 16 ] . Once CCV ( clathrin - coated vesicle ) formation has occurred , many vesicles fuse with EEs ( early endosomes ) . From the EE there are two potential subsequent recycling pathways . First , a short - loop pathway transporting cargo directly back to the plasma membrane . Secondly , a long - loop recycling pathway trafficking cargo to the plasma membrane via the PNRC ( perinuclear recycling compartment ) [ 17 ] ( see Figure 1 ) . However , the organelles involved in recycling via CME can vary depending on cargo [ 18 ] . CME has been widely implicated in cell migration , with reports indicating increased CME towards the leading edge of migrating cells , rather than at the cell rear [ 15 ] . Research is complicated by the diversity of methods employed to inhibit CME . Recent research found that inhibition of CME by siRNA ( small interfering RNA ) knockdown of AP - 2 decreased the migration of the human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line in chemotaxis assays [ 19 ] . CME can also be inhibited by expression of a dominant - negative variant of EPS15 ( epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15 ) . Expression of this mutant in HSB - 2 , CEM and PEER T - cells did not affect generation of a polarized morphology but inhibited migration [ 14 ] . Importantly though , these studies were not performed in epithelial cell lines . The exact role of CME in cell migration is not known ; however , as an integral cellular function , its effects are Figure 1 Trafﬁcking pathways implicated in cell migration Internalization from the plasma membrane can occur via CME and caveolar endocytosis . Post - internalization , vesicles fuse with the EE . After EE fusion , vesicles can undergo short - loop Rab4 - mediated recycling , or Rab11 - dependent long - loop trafﬁcking , returning cargo to the plasma membrane . Proteins synthesized de novo exit from the Golgi in a manner reliant on PKD . Each pathway may play a role in both cell polarization and motility . likely to be diverse . Alterations in focal adhesion dynamics may be responsible for migration defects observed during CME inhibition . Recently , focal adhesion disassembly via internalization of β 1 - integrins has been shown to be dependent on CME [ 19 ] . Furthermore , several receptor tyrosine kinases and G - protein - coupled receptors are internalized by CME [ 20 ] ; thus inhibition of CME may affect signalling and downstream effectors , altering migration . Internalization can also occur via caveolae , sphingolipid and cholesterol - rich plasma membrane microdomains that are home to many signalling molecules [ 21 , 22 ] . Caveolin - 1 is the principal structural component of caveolae , and is required for caveolar biogenesis [ 14 ] . Like CCVs , caveolar - derived vesicles undergo subsequent trafficking to endocytic organellessuchascaveosomesandEEs [ 23 ] . Caveolar - derived vesicles are also capable of plasma membrane fusion [ 23 ] . The precise function of caveolar endocytosis in cell migration has been disputed by several groups . Initial reports found that overexpression of caveolin - 1 inhibits lamel - lipodial extension and migration in the MTLn3 carcinoma cell line [ 22 ] . From these studies , conclusions were drawn implicating caveolin - 1 as a negative regulator of cell migration . Contrary to previous findings , inhibition of caveolar internalization using the cholesterol - sequestering agent , filipin , decreased migration and inhibited invasion of human endothelial cells into collagen I gel [ 24 ] . However , cholesterol depletion may cause global cellular effects via disruption of plasma membrane architecture and function [ 25 ] . Thus the migratory effects observed may not be specific to caveolar endocytosis inhibition [ 24 ] . A role for caveolar endocytosis as a positive regulator of cell migration was further supported by studies utilizing C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2009 Biochemical Society 1074 Biochemical Society Transactions ( 2009 ) Volume 37 , part 5 caveolin - 1 - deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts [ 3 ] . In wound healing assays , these fibroblasts exhibit increased migration speed , poor directionality , a non - polarized mor - phology and an irregular cytoskeleton . Accounting for these migrational and cytoskeletal defects , the group implicated caveolin - 1 as a regulator of Src kinase and its effectors Rho , Rac and Cdc42 ( cell division cycle 42 ) GTPases . Interestingly , recent research has indicated that overexpression of caveolin - 1 exerts a dominant - negative effect [ 26 ] , possibly explaining the contradictory results seen by Zhang et al . [ 22 ] . It is clear that the exact function of caveolar endocytosis in cell motility is not well understood and its role may vary between different cell types . However , care has to be taken when interpreting results based on endocytic pathway inhib - ition . There are several clathrin - and caveolae - independent methods of internalization [ 2 ] . Each internalization pathway requires a different composition of plasma membrane lipids and proteins that is maintained by endocytosis . Inhibition of one endocytosis pathway may drive internalization via other routes , affecting cell migration in a non - specific manner . Exocytic trafﬁcking Although internalization of plasma membrane proteins appears to be an integral part of cell migration , the role of exocytosis cannot be ignored . Several hypotheses suggest a function for exocytosis in cell migration , such as supplying membrane to the leading edge for pseudopod formation and regulation of membrane tension and surface area [ 12 , 27 ] . Whether this importance for migration relies on exocytosis of newly synthesized cargo or the recycling of internalized plasma membrane proteins is unclear . Recycling of internalized cargo back to the plasma membrane is reliant on several members of the Rab GTPase family . Rabs are involved in many aspects of cargo trafficking , regulating vesicle trafficking , fission and fusion [ 17 ] . In particular , Rab4 localizes to the EE and is required for rapid recycling from the EE to the plasma membrane [ 17 ] . Rab11 localizes to PNRC and is essential for PNRC - to - plasma membrane transport in long - loop recycling [ 28 ] . Rab4 is involved in cargo sorting [ 29 ] . Expression of dominant - negative Rab4 ( S22N ) to inhibit short - loop recyclingled todecreasedrecycling of 125 I - taggedreceptorsin HeLa cells [ 29 ] . This may be due to ‘re - routing’ via the long - loop recycling pathway . Supporting this hypothesis , further experiments suggested that expression of Rab4 ( S22N ) led to increased transferrin receptor localization in juxtanuclear compartments [ 29 ] . However , the group failed to confirm this juxtanuclear compartment as the PNRC with standard markers . The precise role of short - loop recycling in cell migration is unknown ; however , its importance is becoming apparent . Expression of dominant - negative Rab4 ( I21I ) in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts decreased directional migration and decreased α v β 3integrintrafficking [ 30 ] . Interestingly , itsexpressionhad no effect on migration speed . These results support findings indicatingshort - looprecyclingasimportantforcellspreading and polarized trafficking of α v β 3 to the leading edge [ 31 , 32 ] . Integrins play a pivotal role in cell migration , regulating adhesion and signalling . It is foreseeable that inhibition of α v β 3 trafficking may be responsible for the directional impairment observed in fibroblasts [ 30 ] . Short - loop recycling may regulate cell directionality by re - sensitizing α v β 3 to ligand , or by stabilizing lamellipodia by inhibition of α 5 β 1 long - loop recycling [ 30 , 33 ] . There are , however , numerous other factors that may link Rab4 recycling with cell migration either directly or by affecting downstream effectors . Rab11 - mediated long - loop recycling has been associated with particularly invasive cancer cells , pointing to a function in cell migration [ 34 ] . Initial findings found that expression of Rab11 ( S25N ) reduced the random migration of MDCK ( Madin – Darby canine kidney ) epithelial cells [ 35 ] . These results were further detailed utilizing the PtK1 epithelial cell line , observing cell migration during inhibition of long - loop recycling in wound healing assays and random migration [ 36 ] . In random migration studies , expression of dominant - negative Rab11b ( S25N ) decreased persistent migration and increased protrusive activity throughout the cell membrane . These findings were further corroborated with cells exhibiting impaired wound healing . Remarkably , when individual cells were monitored , migration speed increased but directional migration was reduced , similar to results observed in caveolin - null fibroblasts [ 3 ] . Moreover , Rab11 - like Rab4 may be involved in specific integrin recycling [ 31 , 37 ] . The decreased directionality observed by Prigozhina and Waterman - Storer [ 36 ] may be due to decreased α 5 β 1 integrin recycling [ 30 ] . Furthermore , expression of Rab11 ( S25N ) decreased localization of α L / β 2 integrin in chemotaxis - induced lamellipodia in CHO ( Chinese - hamster ovary ) cells [ 38 ] . Thus long - loop recycling may aid in cell migration , controlling polarized integrin trafficking during epithelial wound healing . This may regulate both focal adhesion dynamics and directionality via the Rho – ROK ( Rho - associated kinase ) – Cofilin pathway [ 33 ] . There is another member of the Rab11 GTPase family , Rab25 , which is found only in epithelial cells [ 39 ] . Recent studies implicate Rab25 as a factor in cell migration , linking increased Rab25 expression with increased invasiveness both in vivo and in vitro [ 40 , 41 ] . However , expression of Rab25 in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells had no effect on migration speed or directionality on plastic surfaces [ 30 , 41 ] . So far , little research has been conducted as to the function of Rab25 in trafficking , but it may have a role in epithelial cell migration . Although a function for short - and long - loop trafficking in cell migration has been reported , research has also been undertaken into the involvement of newly synthesized protein trafficking in cell migration . Interest in post - Golgi trafficking arose in 1981 , when reorientation of the Golgi be - tween the nucleus and leading edge was observed in migrating endothelial cells [ 42 ] . Later research utilizing VSV ( vesicular - stomatitis virus ) found VSV G - glycoprotein ( a membrane protein of the VSV viron synthesized by host cells ) , which is predominantly located in the leading edge of migrating fibro - blasts [ 43 ] . More recent work has supported these findings in C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2009 Biochemical Society The Dynamic Cell 1075 live cells using TIRFM ( total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ) [ 44 ] . Evidence has also come to light highlighting the importance of Golgi localization and sec - retion in both generation of a polarized phenotype and steady - state migration [ 45 ] . This line of evidence certainly implies synthesis of protein and post - Golgi secretion as an important factor in cell migration . Initial work examining the role of post - Golgi secretion in cell migration used Brefeldin A to disrupt the Golgi appar - atus . Brefeldin A treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts inhibited polarized phenotype generation and cell migration , affected membrane protrusion and disrupted the actin cytoskeleton [ 46 ] . However , Brefeldin A causes non - specific effects , such as tubulation of peripheral organelles such as the EE [ 47 ] , in - dicating that changes in migratory phenotype may not solely be due to biosynthetic pathway inhibition . New insights into post - Golgi trafficking found that post - Golgi secretion is dependent on PKD ( protein kinase D ) for vesicle fission from the Golgi [ 30 , 48 ] . Blocking this biosynthetic pathway by ex - pressingadominant - negativePKD ( K618N ) mutantinhibited lamellipodial activity at the leading edge , retrograde flow and decreased motility in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts [ 49 ] . Thus the biosynthetic pathway may be a requirement for generation of a polarized phenotype and persistent migration . Obviously , how inhibition of trafficking of numerous newly synthesized proteins affects cell migration is extremely complex . How - ever , changes in gene expression and up - regulation of certain proteins are a clear factor in cancer cell motility . This may explain how inhibition of post - Golgi secretion of proteins synthesized de novo could effect migration [ 50 ] . However , more work is needed in this area , particularly in epithelial models . Conclusion A caveat when examining the role of trafficking in cell migration is the use of a variety of different cell types . Different cell types may utilize different migration strategies with varying requirements for cell – cell and cell – substrate interactions [ 9 ] . Therefore how vesicle trafficking may influence migration in single cells undergoing migration may not be the same as its effect during collective migration . A clear role for several trafficking pathways in cell migration has been observed by a multitude of groups ; yet there are limitations in extrapolating these finding to other cell types . This may explain the seemingly contradictory results repor - ted from different groups . However , methodology is always a factor in result interpretation , with variations in trafficking pathway inhibition possibly generating non - specific effects or incomplete inhibition . Furthermore , the assays and parameters used to measure cell migration / polarization vary widely , some observing cells migrating towards a chemoattractant or in response to a wound . Other methods include cell crawling in a two - dimensional manner on a glass / plastic - coated dishes or invading a three - dimensional gel matrix , all of which may alter migratory behaviour , with a different reliance on a specific trafficking pathway . This highlights the need for a systematic approach to examining the role of vesicle trafficking in cell migration , particularly if applied to one robust assay system , such as epithelial wound healing .
