Their rapid multiplication depends on remodeling of cytoplasmic membranes for viral 24 genome replication . It is unknown how virions assemble around these newly synthesized 25 genomes and how they are then loaded into autophagic membranes for release through 26 secretory autophagy . Here , we use cryo - electron tomography of infected cells to show that 27 poliovirus assembles directly on replication membranes . Pharmacological untethering of 28 capsids from membranes abrogates RNA encapsidation . Our data directly visualize a 29 membrane - bound half - capsid as a prominent virion assembly intermediate . Assembly 30 progression past this intermediate depends on the class III phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase 31 VPS34 , a key host - cell autophagy factor . On the other hand , the canonical autophagy initiator 32 ULK1 is shown to restrict virion production since its inhibition leads to increased accumulation 33 of virions in vast intracellular arrays , followed by an increased vesicular release at later time 34 points . Finally , we identify multiple layers of selectivity in virus - induced autophagy , with a 35 strong selection for RNA - loaded virions over empty capsids and the segregation of virions from 36 other types of autophagosome contents . These findings provide an integrated structural 37 framework for multiple stages of the poliovirus life cycle . 38 39 Main 40 Enteroviruses are a major genus of positive - sense RNA viruses within the Picornaviridae 41 family . They cause a wide variety of human diseases such as poliomyelitis ( poliovirus ) , related 42 acute flaccid myelitis conditions ( e . g . EV - D68 ) , and viral myocarditis ( Coxsackievirus B3 ) . The 43 enterovirus particle is a non - enveloped particle of ~ 30 nm diameter , encapsidating a single - 44 stranded RNA genome of about 7500 nucleotides . 45 Upon infection , enteroviruses rapidly remodel cytoplasmic membranes to create an optimal 46 environment for virus replication 1 - 3 . This starts with disassembly of the secretory pathway , in 47 particular the Golgi apparatus as seen by dispersion of Golgi marker proteins throughout the 48 cytoplasm 4 . Ensuing single membrane tubules and vesicles are the site of viral RNA 49 replication , but little is known about the site of virion assembly 3 , 5 . The viral genome has 50 preferential interaction sites with the capsid but contains no known high - affinity packaging 51 signal sufficient for RNA loading into capsids 6 , 7 . This suggests that virion assembly may take 52 place in immediate vicinity of RNA production sites to ensure specific RNA encapsidation , 53 which is supported by the finding that the viral membrane - bound helicase 2C interacts with the 54 capsid protein VP3 7 , 8 . 55 3 A biochemically distinct late stage of replication starts around 6 hours post - infection ( h p . i . ) . It 56 is characterized by the lipidation of host proteins belonging to the LC3 subfamily of ATG8s , a 57 hallmark of the autophagy pathway 9 . Induction of autophagy in infected cells is mediated by 58 the viral protein 2BC and is independent of the ULK1 / ULK2 protein kinases that initiate 59 canonical autophagy 9 , 10 . At this late stage , double - membrane structures reminiscent of 60 autophagic membranes are formed in the infected cell 11 . The inherently non - enveloped 61 picornaviruses have recently been shown to leave cells non - lytically as groups of virions 62 contained in LC3 - positive lipid vesicles 12 - 16 . It thus seems plausible that autophagy - like double - 63 membrane structures observed in infected cells relate to non - lytic virus egress . However , 64 conventional EM sample preparation is too destructive to macromolecular structure to allow 65 an in situ analysis of autophagosome contents - the experiment needed to directly test this 66 hypothesis . 67 To shed light on how enteroviruses are assembled and packaged into autophagosomes , we 68 took advantage of recent advances in focused - ion - beam milling and cryo - electron 69 tomography 17 - 21 . The in situ structures of poliovirus - infected cells revealed that enteroviruses 70 assemble directly on replication membranes . Completion of virus assembly requires the host 71 lipid kinase VPS34 , and RNA loading into virions correlates with their membrane tethering . 72 Inhibiting the initiation of canonical autophagy surprisingly increased virion production and 73 release . The cryo - electron tomograms further revealed that virus - induced autophagy has a 74 striking degree of selectivity , selecting RNA - containing virions over empty capsids , and 75 segregating virions from other types of autophagosome contents . 76 77 4 Results 78 Cryo - electron tomography reveals that poliovirus RNA loading requires capsid 79 tethering to membranes 80 To investigate enterovirus assembly in situ , we infected HeLa cells with poliovirus type 1 and 81 imaged the cytoplasm with cryo - electron tomography at different time points post infection 82 ( Supplementary fig . 1 ) . At 3 h p . i . first new virions had already assembled in the cells 83 ( Supplementary Fig . 2A - D ) . Tomograms recorded at 6 h p . i . showed a more starkly remodeled 84 cytoplasm ( Fig . 1A - B ) . Compared to uninfected cells and 3 h p . i . , there was a significant 85 increase in both open cup - shaped structures resembling phagophores and closed double - 86 membrane vesicles ( Fig . 1A - B , Supplementary fig . 2A - G ) . These membranes will collectively 87 be referred to as autophagy - like membranes ( ALMs ) . 88 From the tomograms we could clearly distinguish empty capsids from RNA - loaded virions ( Fig . 89 1A - B ) . At 6 h p . i . the cytoplasmic concentration of empty and RNA - loaded particles was on 90 average 7 and 20 times higher than at 3 h p . i . , respectively , as measured by a template 91 matching procedure ( Fig . 1E ) . Strikingly , both empty capsids and RNA - loaded virions were 92 frequently tethered to membranes through macromolecular complexes ( Fig . 1A - D , yellow 93 arrowheads ) . The tether appeared to have a defined size and keep the virions at a defined 94 distance from the membrane . At 6 h p . i . , virions were tethered to both single - membrane tubes 95 and vesicles ( SMs ) and ALMs , and the fraction of empty vs . RNA - loaded virions was similar 96 on both types of membranes ( Fig . 1F ) . We noticed that virions were only tethered to the outer 97 face of ALMs and SMs , whereas virions engulfed by ALMs had lost the tether ( Fig . 1A , red 98 arrow and Fig . 1G ) . 99 The visualization of capsids tethered to replication membranes suggested that capsid RNA 100 loading took place on membranes rather than in the cytosol . To test this we used ( 5 - 3 , 4 - 101 dichlorophenyl ) - methylhydantoin ( henceforth Hydantoin ) , an antiviral drug that inhibits RNA 102 loading of PV capsids 22 . Cells were infected with PV and treated with Hydantoin at a 103 concentration of 50 µg / ml that did not interfere with viral RNA replication 22 before processing 104 for cryo - ET at 6 h p . i . This revealed both an increase in the fraction of empty capsids to ~ 70 % 105 and a ~ 3 - fold decrease in the fraction of tethered capsids in Hydantoin - treated cells ( Fig . 1H - 106 K ) . Notably , that the abundance of SMs and ALMs remained unchanged ( Supplementary fig . 107 2H ) . Together , these data show that newly assembled poliovirus capsids are tethered to the 108 cytoplasmic face of SMs and ALMs and tethering facilitates viral RNA encapsidation . 109 110 Enterovirus capsid assembly takes place on membranes and requires VPS34 activity 111 5 Tomograms of infected cells at 6 h p . i . frequently contained novel structures that had a size 112 and shape consistent with partial capsids ( Fig . 2A - E , Supplementary Fig . 3A - B ) . Strikingly , in 113 15 tomograms of infected cells , 96 % of these bona fide capsid intermediates were membrane - 114 associated ( 58 % SM , 38 % ALM ) whereas only 4 % were found in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2F ) . The 115 capsid intermediates contained variable luminal densities and were observed at different 116 angles to the membranes ( Fig . 2B - E ) . Due to this structural variability , we characterized them 117 by a simple angle of closure , which resulted in a unimodal distribution with an average of 169° , 118 i . e . closely corresponding to half a capsid ( Fig . 2G ) . The clear clustering around a single value 119 indicates that the membrane - bound capsid intermediate is a single , or a set of closely related , 120 molecular species . 121 Given the frequent association of partial and complete capsids with ALMs , we inhibited 122 autophagy using two selective inhibitors : MRT68921 and Vps34 - IN1 . MRT68921 inhibits the 123 ULK1 / ULK2 protein kinases that initiate canonical autophagy 23 , whereas Vps34 - IN1 inhibits 124 the lipid kinase VPS34 that produces phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) on the growing 125 phagophore membrane 24 . Consistent with previous studies , PV induced ULK - independent LC3 126 lipidation at 6 h p . i . 10 . However , co - treating infected cells with both inhibitors strongly 127 decreased LC3 lipidation ( Supplementary fig . S4A ) . Tomograms of co - treated cells revealed 128 reduced membrane proliferation and a 2 orders of magnitude decrease in both empty and 129 RNA - loaded capsids ( Fig . 3A - E ; Supplementary fig . 4B ) . However , the number and distribution 130 of membrane - bound capsid intermediates were unaffected ( Fig . 3E ; Supplementary fig . 4C - 131 D ) . The stalled progress from capsid intermediates to full capsids meant that we could observe 132 a rare , more advanced assembly stage that may represent the transition from the half - capsid 133 intermediate to a complete membrane - tethered virion ( Fig . 3D ) . Moreover Vps34 - IN1 134 treatment alone had the same effect as the combination of inhibitors ( Supplementary Fig . 4E - 135 G ) . The decrease in intracellular assembled virus was mirrored by a decrease in virus release 136 from VPS34 - inhibited cells ( Fig . 3F ) . Notably , as viral RNA replication was unaffected by 137 inhibiting VPS34 , this suggested that VPS34 activity is essential for virus assembly rather than 138 RNA replication ( Supplementary fig . 4G ) . 139 Since VPS34 inhibition decreased LC3 lipidation , we sought to determine if Vps34 - IN1’s effect 140 on virus assembly was mediated by ATG8 family proteins . We infected CRISPR - generated 141 triple knock out ( 3KO ) cells of the LC3 subfamily , and 3KO cells of the GABARAP subfamily 142 and imaged them at 6 h p . i . The only significant change to membrane structures was a 143 decrease in ALMs in infected LC3 3KO cells ( Supplementary fig 4I ) . This was paralleled by a 144 decrease of intracellular virions in LC3 KO cells ( Fig . 3G ) . Interestingly , those areas of LC3 145 3KO cytoplasm that still contained ALMs also contained virions , whereas areas with large SMs 146 were devoid of virions ( Fig . 3H - I ) . By comparison , GABARAP 3KO cells still robustly 147 6 accumulated ALMs ( Fig . 3J ) , and there was less change in intracellular virus concentration 148 upon GABARAP deletion ( Fig . 3G ) . Together this indicates that PI ( 3 ) P - decorated remodeled 149 membranes , rather than any individual ATG8 protein , are necessary for enterovirus assembly . 150 This notion was strengthened by the observation that VPS34 inhibition further reduced virus 151 release from LC3 3KO cells , similar to its effect on wildtype cells ( Fig . 3K ) . 152 In summary , enterovirus capsid assembly takes place on membranes with a prominent half - 153 capsid intermediate , and activity of the lipid kinase VPS34 is required for assembly to progress 154 beyond this intermediate . 155 156 Inhibition of ULK1 leads to formation of intracellular virus arrays and increased 157 vesicular release 158 Although Inhibition of ULK1 and its homologue ULK2 , the initiators of canonical autophagy , did 159 not affect PV - induced LC3 lipidation or the generation of ALMs ( Fig . 4A - B , Supplementary Fig . 160 5A ) , we found that ULK - inhibited cells contained large cytoplasmic arrays of virions ( Fig . 4A - 161 B ) . The arrays contained several hundred virions , virtually all RNA - loaded , in what seemed to 162 be a close - packing arrangement . Virus arrays were also visible in freeze - substituted sections , 163 which allowed sampling of a larger number of cells ( Supplementary fig . 5B - E ) . Arrays were 164 found in 3 % of untreated cells and 56 % of ULK - inhibited cells ( Fig . 4C ) , a significantly higher 165 fraction , thus indicating that ULK inhibition upregulates intracellular virus array formation . 166 The formation of virus arrays may either be due to a defect in virion release from ULK - inhibited 167 cells , or the arrays may be part of an increased intracellular virion pool en route to release . 168 The ‘release scenario’ was supported by the observation that RNA - loaded virions were 169 abundant in ALMs in ULK - inhibited cells ( Fig . 4D - G ) . To further discriminate between these 170 two scenarios , we measured released infectious virus from ULK - inhibited cells at different time 171 points and compared it to untreated cells . While extracellular PV titers were unchanged at 6 h 172 p . i . , we measured one order of magnitude increase over untreated cells at 8 h p . i . ( Figure 4H ) . 173 To determine if the increased virus release at late time point still took place through secretory 174 autophagy , we isolated the extracellular vesicular fraction . A strong increase in capsid protein 175 as well as lipidated LC3 from ULK - inhibited cells confirmed that the virions were released in 176 vesicles positive for LC3 ( Fig . 4I ) . Taken together , ULK activity in infected cells is not necessary 177 for downstream autophagy processes such as LC3 lipidation but appears to put a break on the 178 intracellular accumulation and vesicular release of virions . 179 180 7 Selective packaging of RNA - loaded virion and contents segregation in autophagic 181 membranes 182 The observation that virions are tethered to the outside of ALMs but not to the inside ( Fig . 1G ) 183 indicated that cryo - ET can provide structural insights into the process of virion packaging into 184 autophagic membranes . Indeed , the tomograms of PV - infected cells at 6 h p . i . showed several 185 stages of autophagic engulfment of virions , ranging from wide open phagophores to completely 186 sealed DMVs ( Fig . 5A - E ) . We then re - evaluated the statistics of empty capsids and RNA - 187 loaded virions at 6 h p . i . taking particle location ( outside or inside ALMs ) into consideration . 188 Strikingly , this revealed that autophagic engulfment strongly selects for RNA - loaded virions . 189 Outside ALMs , empty capsids represent 23 % of particles , whereas only 1 % of particles in 190 ALMs were empty capsids ( Fig . 5F ) . 191 The tomograms allowed further classification of ALMs based on their contents ( Fig . 5G - M ) . At 192 52 % , the most abundant class was ALMs containing RNA - loaded virions ( Fig . 5A - E , G ) . The 193 second most abundant class , at 15 % , was ALMs containing amorphous granular material that 194 was clearly denser than the remaining cytoplasmic contents ( Fig . 5G , H ) . These dense 195 granules were frequently co - packed with virions ( Figure 5G , J ) . One distinct class representing 196 13 % of ALMs contained tightly packed bundles of protein filaments ( Fig . 5G , I , Supplementary 197 Fig 6A - B ) . As opposed to the dense granules , filaments were rarely co - packaged with other 198 ALM contents ( Fig . 5G ) . The filaments were not affected by VPS34 inhibition , but instead 199 completely absent in both LC3 and GABARAP 3KO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6C ) . This is the 200 opposite dependence on autophagy host factors than that displayed by virus assembly ( Fig . 201 3G ) . We determined the filament structure by subtomogram averaging to 18 . 5 Å resolution , 202 which yielded a helix with an average diameter of 10 nm , 29° twist and 52 Å rise per subunit 203 ( Supplementary Fig . 6D - E ) . From this map the identity of the filament could not be positively 204 determined , but the map did allow definitive exclusion of protein filaments with known structure . 205 A systematic comparison of the filament to all relevant mammalian protein filaments in the 206 electron microscopy database allowed exclusion of all except decorated actin filaments 207 ( Supplementary Fig . S7 and Table S3 for complete list ) . Thus , the filament is either actin 208 decorated by a vinculin - like actin - binding protein , or an unknown viral or cellular protein 209 filament of similar size and shape . 210 Altogether , these data reveal an exquisite specificity in virus - induced autophagy : autophagic 211 membranes selectively engulf RNA - loaded virions while excluding empty capsids , and co - 212 package virions with dense granular material while segregating them from a second class of 213 ALMs that contains bundles of protein filaments . 214 215 8 Discussion 216 Here we present an in situ structural analysis of enterovirus replication by cryo - electron 217 tomography . Our study focuses on the involvement of autophagic membranes in virion 218 assembly and egress , and the data are consistent with the model presented in Fig . 6 . 219 Compared to viral RNA replication , much less is known about the site and pathway of 220 enterovirus assembly . A membrane - proximal location of the assembly has been suggested , 221 but direct evidence has been missing . In tomograms of infected cells , we identified an 222 abundant capsid assembly intermediate structurally equivalent to half of an enterovirus capsid 223 ( Fig . 2 ) . It was to 96 % found directly docked to membranes in infected cells , and at roughly 224 equal proportions on the cytosolic face of SMs and ALMs , which suggests that these two 225 membrane types both serve as virus assembly platforms . Our findings are consistent with 226 ultracentrifugation studies of enterovirus - infected cells that detected an abundant capsid - 227 related species equivalent to half of an empty capsid , without being able to elucidate its 228 identity 25 , 26 . 229 The current paradigm of non - enveloped virus assembly holds that the proteinaceous capsid 230 either assembles independently followed by energy - expending genome loading , or is 231 templated by the genome 27 . Our finding extends that paradigm with a third mode : assembly 232 that is assisted by the replication membrane and its bound components . A slow transition past 233 the half - capsid intermediate may help ensure that the viral RNA has been incorporated before 234 the capsid closes . This is consistent with a previously proposed “late proofreading” mechanism 235 that aimed to explain why only recently produced viral RNA , present on the replication 236 membrane , is incorporated into virions 28 . 237 We showed that the lipid kinase VPS34 is a host factor required for assembly to progress past 238 the half - capsid intermediate ( Fig . 3 ) . The VPS34 requirement may explain why the membrane - 239 bound picornaviral helicase 2C binds the PI3 kinase complex 29 , in which VPS34 is the catalytic 240 subunit . Hence , 2C may enable the virus to activate VPS34 independently of ULK1 - dependent 241 canonical autophagy induction . In fact , we show that pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 further 242 boosts virus assembly and release ( Fig . 4 ) , and it was previously reported that poliovirus 243 infection partially depletes ULK1 10 . The picture that emerges is that the virus optimizes the 244 cellular environment by suppressing the master switch of canonical autophagy , ULK1 , while at 245 the same time activating necessary subsystems of the autophagy pathway , such as VPS34 , 246 in alternative ways . 247 The cryo - electron tomograms revealed several layers of selectivity in enterovirus - induced 248 autophagy ( Fig . 5 ) . Perhaps most remarkably , there is a strong selectivity for packaging of 249 RNA - loaded virions over empty capsids . Selectivity had not previously been demonstrated for 250 9 virus - induced autophagy , but it is frequent in other forms of autophagy . There , so - called 251 autophagy receptors mediate the degradation of specific cytoplasmic components by linking 252 them to LC3 on the growing phagophore membrane 30 . The case of enterovirus particles thus 253 seems to present a conundrum : How can phagophores selectively package RNA - loaded 254 virions over empty capsids when the external surfaces of both these particles are virtually 255 identical 31 ? Further studies will be needed to elucidate this mechanism , but a clue may be 256 provided by the correlation between RNA loading of capsids and their membrane tethering , as 257 well as the loss of tethering upon autophagic engulfment ( Fig . 1 ) . 258 The tomograms allowed further structural catalogization of ALM contents in infected cells ( Fig . 259 5 ) . Viruses were frequently copackaged with dense granular material which has also been 260 seen in tomograms of vesicles released from enterovirus - infected cells 32 . The high electron 261 density of the granules is compatible with them containing RNA , which could mean that non - 262 encapsidated viral or cellular RNA is released in the same vesicles as virions . On the other 263 hand , virions were markedly segregated from ALMs that contained bundles of protein 264 filaments . The filaments had a structural signature compatible with decorated F - actin . This 265 tentative identity of the filaments would tie together previous reports that the actin cytoskeleton 266 largely disappears in both starved and enterovirus - infected cells 33 , 34 . In starved cells this is 267 linked to presence of F - actin in the lumen of LC3 - positive membranes ( where it was suggested 268 to play a role in shaping the phagophore ) 34 . It is thus possible that the filament - filled ALMs 269 represent structural snapshots of this process . 270 In summary , our study of poliovirus - infected cells by cryo - electron tomography reveals 271 membrane - assisted capsid assembly and a link between membrane tethering and RNA - 272 loading of virions . It further shows the multi - faceted nature of autophagy in enterovirus - infected 273 cells , balancing virion production and autophagic engulfment , making sure that only RNA - 274 loaded virions are packaged in phagophores and segregating them from other types of 275 autophagic cargoes . 276 277 Acknowledgments 278 We would like to thank Carlson lab members , Sven Carlsson , and Richard Lundmark for 279 constructive suggestions , Dale Corkery for help with the LC3 lipidation assay , as well as Nitesh 280 Mistry for help with virus purification ( all Umeå University ) .

Poliovirus Type 1 Mahoney strain was a gift from George Belov ( UMD ) . 316 Drug treatments 317 HeLa cells were pre - treated with DMSO or 1 µM MRT68921 ( SML1644 , Merck ) in culture 318 medium , 1h before the infection . Medium was replaced with serum free media containing 319 DMSO or 1 µM MRT68921 and cells were infected with Poliovirus ( PV ) at MOI 5 for 1h . 320 Inoculum was then removed , and cells were incubated in fresh media containing 2 % FBS and 321 1 µM MRT68921 and / or 5µM Vps34 - IN1 or 50 µg / mL hydantoin ( 5 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) - 5 - 322 methylimidazolidine - 2 , 4 - dione ( EN300 - 21815 ) ) for 3h to 8h . Vps34 - IN1 ( 17392 , Cayman 323 chemicals ) was added to the cell media at 1 h p . i . to not interfere with the endocytosis - based 324 viral entry . Hydantoin was added at 1 h p . i . After addition , all inhibitors were kept in the cell 325 media throughout the experiments . 326 LC3 lipidation assay 327 For each condition and time point , HeLa cells were seeded in two T25 flasks ( 2x10 6 cells / flask ) 328 and infected with poliovirus at MOI 5 . Infected cells were collected by trypsinization , then 329 centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min , pellets were resuspended in PBS and washed twice with PBS . 330 Cells were lysed with lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH8 , 300 mM KCl , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 25 % 331 Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA ) on ice for 15min , passed through a 22G needle 332 and centrifuged at 15 , 000 rpm for 20 min .

Prior to use , UltrAufoil grids were glow - discharged , dipped in ethanol and then 349 washed with cell media for 30 min . HeLa cells were infected with poliovirus at MOI 5 for 1h in 350 serum - free media at 37°C . The µ - Slide was gently agitated every 15 min to ensure an even 351 coverage and maximize virus contact with the cell monolayer . After 1h of virus absorption , the 352 inoculum was replaced with fresh DMEM media supplemented with 2 % FBS . Infected cells 353 were plunge - frozen in liquid ethane - propane mix 3h or 6h post - infection using a Vitrobot plunge 354 freezer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 23°C , 90 % humidity , with blot force - 5 and blot time 6 . 5 355 s . 356 357 Cryo - lamella generation and characterization 358 Cryo - lamellas of poliovirus - infected cells were generated employing the wedge - milling method 359 36 using a Scios focused - ion - beam scanning electron microscope ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . 360 To prevent sample drift during the milling process and to enhance sample conductivity , the 361 samples were first coated with platinum using the gas injection system ( GIS , ThermoFisher 362 Scientific ) operated at 26°C , at 12 mm stage working distance and 7 seconds gas injection 363 time . The milling was performed at a tilt angle within a range of 17° – 23° stage tilt . Lamella 364 preparation was performed in a stepwise milling using parallel rectangular pattern above and 365 below the area of interest , with reducing the ion beam current throughout the milling process , 366 from 0 . 3 nA for the first milling step to remove the bulk material to 0 . 03 nA at the final cleaning 367 step to obtain the lamella which was set to a minimum thickness of 200 nm . To minimize the 368 contamination of lamellas with ice crystals , they were stored in liquid nitrogen for less than a 369 week before tilt - series collection at the Titan Krios ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . The final 370 thickness of lamellas was measured at the Titan Krios . Two images of the same area of a 371 lamella were recorded at an intermediate magnification ( 8700x ) : an energy - filtered image ( F 372 image ) , and non - filtered image for which the energy filter slit was removed ( nF image ) . The 373 13 lamella thickness was estimated as 350 * ln ( I ( nF ) / I ( F ) ) , where I ( nF ) and I ( F ) are the intensities 374 in the non - filtered and filtered images , respectively , and 350 the estimate of the electron mean - 375 free path at 300 kV in ice ( in nm ) . 376 377 Cryo - electron tomography 378 Data was collected using a Titan Krios ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) operated at 300 kV in parallel 379 illumination mode . Tilt series were recorded using SerialEM software on a K2 Summit detector 380 ( Gatan , Pleasanton , CA ) operated in super - resolution mode . The K2 Summit detector was 381 mounted on a BioQuantum energy filter ( Gatan , Pleasanton , CA ) operated with a 20eV slit 382 width . A condenser aperture of 70 μm and an objective aperture of 100 μm were chosen for 383 tilt - series collection . Coma - free alignment was performed with AutoCtf / Sherpa ( ThermoFisher 384 Scientific ) . Tilt - series were acquired in dose - symmetric or bi - directional mode . Due to the pre - 385 tilt of the lamellas , the starting angle used was + 13° for dose - symmetric , and - 21° to - 25° for 386 bi - directional tilt series acquisition . The following parameters were used for acquisition : 33kx 387 nominal magnification corresponding to a specimen pixel size of 2 . 145 Å ; defocus range - 3 to 388 - 5 µm , tilt - range depending on the lamella pre - tilt and thickness typically ± 50° to ± 60° ; tilt 389 increment 2° or 3° ; total electron dose ~ 100 e− / Å 2 ( bidirectional tilt series ) and 130 e - / Å2 ( dose - 390 symmetric tilt series ) . The exposure dose was not varied as a function of tilt angle . At each tilt 391 angle , the exposure was saved as a non - gain - corrected TIFF movie containing a dose per 392 frame of around 0 . 25 per super - resolution pixel . 393 394 Cryo - electron tomography data processing 395 Super - resolution TIFF movies were unpacked and gain - reference corrected , and subsequently 396 corrected for sample motion using MotionCor2 37 . The motion correction included a factor 2 397 binning resulting in a specimen pixel size of 4 . 29 Å . After reassembly of tilt - series image stacks 398 they were processed using IMOD 38 . Tilt series were aligned using patch tracking . The aligned 399 stacks were CTF - corrected with a custom - made script using CTFFIND4 39 and 400 CTFPHASEFLIP 40 , a part of IMOD 38 . Tomograms were then generated in IMOD using 401 weighted back projection , no low - pass filtering was performed at this stage . For visualization , 402 tomograms were 4 times binned using IMOD , resulting in a pixel size of 17 . 16 Å and denoised 403 using the boxfilter option in Amira software ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Filtered tomograms were 404 further segmented using Amira for the representation of membranes , protein densities and 405 filaments , the last using the Fiber tracing module . Subtomogram averages of empty capsids 406 and RNA - loaded virions were integrated in these 3D renderings through UCSF Chimera 41 . 407 408 Subtomogram averaging of viruses 409 14 Subtomogram averaging of virus particles for visualization purposes was performed using 410 Dynamo 42 , 43 . For RNA - loaded virions , a total of 300 particles were manually picked in two 411 tomograms containing the cytoplasmic virus arrays ( MRT68921 - treated cells ) . For empty 412 viruses , a total 198 particles were manually picked in two tomograms from Hydantoin - treated 413 cells . Subvolumes of unbinned particles ( 4 . 29 Å / px ) were extracted with a box size of 414 100 * 100 * 100 voxels . Subvolumes were first iteratively aligned against each other allowing only 415 shifts using a spherical mask with radius of 48px and a Gaussian falloff of 3 px . After centering 416 particles , a full rotational alignment was performed . The average was realigned to icosahedral 417 symmetry axes and a final average was calculated with imposed icosahedral symmetry . Gold - 418 standard FSC curves for resolution estimation of the virus averages were calculated in 419 Dynamo , resulting in a resolution estimate of 25 Å for empty capsids and 30 Å for RNA - loaded 420 virions at a Fourier shell correlation threshold of 0 . 143 . Subtomogram averages were low - pass 421 filtered to their respective resolution and the 3D renderings were created in UCSF Chimera . 422 423 Subtomogram averaging of filaments 424 The subtomogram selection , extraction and averaging followed the workflow schematically 425 presented in Fig . S8 . 1856 filaments were traced in 16 tomograms using the fiber tracing 426 module 44 in Amira ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The tracing was performed within manually 427 segmented regions corresponding to filament - filled autophagy - like membranes , and the 428 tracing parameters were selected so that the number and length of the filaments was 429 consistent with their visual appearance in the tomograms . Filament coordinates were exported 430 from Amira and imported to Dynamo using a custom - written MATLAB ( Mathworks ) script , after 431 which Dynamo was used to extract subtomograms at regular intervals . Initially , an 432 oversampled subtomogram extraction was performed , with ( 100px ) ^ 3 subtomograms 433 extracted along the filament axis at 5 px intervals . This resulted in 55 , 376 subtomograms . Each 434 subtomogram was assigned initial Euler angles that aligned it with the traced filament axis , but 435 gave it a randomized rotation along that axis . The subsequent alignments and classifications 436 were performed using a cylindrical mask with a radius of 16 px and a Gaussian falloff of 3 or 5 437 px . Subtomogram averaging was performed in Dynamo . After an initial single iteration allowing 438 for centering of the subtomograms perpendicularly to the filament axis , several iterations were 439 performed allowing for shifts , free rotations around the filament axis and a + / - 30° tilt with 440 respect to the filament axis . At this stage of the data processing , efforts to determine filament 441 polarity by allowing each subtomogram in a given filament to change orientation during 442 alignment , and then imposing the majority orientation on all subunits of the filament were not 443 yet successful . From the full oversampled dataset , overlapping subtomograms were removed 444 using a distance threshold of 10 px ( 42 . 9 Å ) , resulting in a set of 16 , 682 subtomograms . These 445 subtomograms were subjected to a five - class multireference alignment ( MRA ) in Dynamo . 446 15 Three of the five classes had a similar , regular helical appearance , and were pooled for a 447 second round of MRA with five classes , from which one class of 3517 subtomograms was 448 better defined than the others . This class was subjected to a half - set gold - standard refinement 449 in Dynamo resulting in a resolution estimate of 23 . 8 Å at a Fourier shell correlation threshold 450 of 0 . 143 . The resulting average allowed a first estimation of the helical parameters as a rise of 451 ~ 56 Å per subunit and a rotation of ~ 36° per subunit . At this point , tomograms were re - 452 reconstructed using NovaCTF to allow for 3D CTF correction by phase flipping 45 . 453 Subtomograms were reextracted at positions corresponding to the helical subunits , which after 454 removal of overlapping particles resulted in an enlarged data set of 10897 subtomograms . 455 These subtomogram poses and positions were exported from Dynamo for further processing 456 in the subTOM package written in MATLAB with functions adapted from the TOM 46 , AV3 47 and 457 Dynamo packages . The scripts and relevant documentation are available to download 458 [ https : / / www2 . mrc - lmb . cam . ac . uk / groups / briggs / resources ] . Additionally , instead of a binary 459 wedge mask , a modified wedge mask was used 48 . The missing wedge was modelled at all 460 processing stages as the average of the amplitude spectra of subtomograms extracted from 461 regions of each tomogram containing empty ice , and was applied during alignment and 462 averaging . We applied both principal component analysis ( PCA ) and multivariate statistical 463 analysis ( MSA ) to classify subtomograms by filament straightness and similar helical 464 parameters . The PCA was performed on wedge - masked difference ( WMD ) maps 49 with 465 calculations implemented in MATLAB using code adapted from PEET 49 and Dynamo 466 packages , and MSA also implemented in MATLAB using code adapted from I3 50 . Movies 467 detailing the variability related to each Eigenvolume from MSA classification were generated 468 using Eigen - filtering / reconstruction methods , and similar movies from WMD classifications 469 were generated by producing class averages sorted by determined Eigencoefficients . 470 Improved class averages allowed for recalculation of helical parameters and further sub - boxing 471 as well as determining the filament polarity . Specifically , the sub - box poses and positions were 472 determined by auto - correlation of the reference after rotation along the filament axis , which 473 yielded a helical symmetry with a rise of 51 . 5 Å and rotation of 29° , and then duplicates within 474 a sphere of diameter 50 Å were removed . Poses were not adjusted from their gold - standard 475 alignment values and the Fourier shell correlation determined resolution was improved to 18 . 5 476 Å at the 0 . 143 threshold . Following the FSC calculation , the half - maps were averaged , filtered 477 to the measured resolution by the determined FSC - curve and sharpened using a heuristically 478 determined B - factor of - 4000 Å 2 51 . 479 Quantitative analysis of membrane structures and virions 480 Tomograms were visually inspected and membrane structures such as single - membrane 481 vesicles and tubes were assigned as single membranes . Double membrane structures were 482 16 assigned as phagophore - like membranes if they had a clear opening within the tomogram 483 volume ( i . e . were cup - shaped ) , and as double - membrane vesicles if they did not have an 484 opening . Collectively , these two types of double - membrane structures were referred to as 485 autophagy - like membranes . Virus particles were localized and counted in each tomogram with 486 template matching using PyTom 52 . For empty capsids and RNA - loaded virions template 487 matching was performed using respectively the re - sampled , filtered empty capsid ( EMD - 9644 ) 488 and mature virion ( EMD - 9642 ) cryo - EM structures of the human coxsackievirus A10 53 . The 489 concentration of each structures was obtained by dividing the total number of structures by the 490 volume of the corresponding tomogram . The number of tomograms obtained for all the 491 conditions are listed in the supplementary table S1 . The closure of viral capsid intermediates 492 was calculated using IMOD . First , in a central section through the capsid intermediate , the 493 circumference was traced and measured with IMOD drawing tools , then the open length was 494 divided by the circumference of a complete virus particle . This fraction was multiplied by 360 495 to get the angle of the cone that describes the capsid assembly intermediate . 496 497 Freeze substitution 498 Poliovirus - infected HeLa cells non - treated and treated with MRT68921 were grown on carbon - 499 coated sapphire discs and high - pressure frozen at 6 h p . i . using a Leica HPM100 . Freeze 500 substitution was performed as a variation of the Kukulski protocol 54 . Briefly , sapphire discs 501 placed in adapted carriers were filled with freeze substituent ( 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate in acetone , 502 1 % H2O ) and placed in a temperature - controlling AFS2 ( Leica ) equipped with an FPS robot . 503 In the first step , freeze - substitution occurred at - 90ºC for 48 h then the temperature was raised 504 to - 45ºC . The samples were maintained in the freeze substituent at - 45ºC for 5 h before 505 washing 3 times with acetone followed by a temperature increase and infiltration with 506 increasing concentrations of Lowicryl HM20 . Finally , the samples were gradually warmed up 507 to - 25°C before infiltrating 3 times with 100 % Lowicryl and UV - polymerized for 48h at - 25ºC . 508 Polymerization then continued for another 24 h at room temperature . The embedded samples 509 were sectioned with a diamond knife ( DiATOME - 90 ) to slices of 60 - 120 nm thickness by using 510 ultramicrotome ( Reichart ULTRACUT S ) . Imaging was performed in FEI Talos electron 511 microscope operating at 120 kV . Grids were examined at a Talos L120C ( FEI , Eindhoven , The 512 Netherlands ) operating at 120kV . Micrographs were acquired with a Ceta 16M CCD camera 513 ( FEI , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) using TEM Image & Analysis software ver . 4 . 17 ( FEI , 514 Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) . 515 516 Confocal microscopy analysis 517 HeLa wildtype ( WT ) , LC3 3KO and GAB 3KO cells were infected with PV for 1h at MOI 5 in 518 serum free media , washed and kept in 2 % FCS DMEM / high glucose for 3h or 6h . Cells were 519 17 fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) / phosphate buffer solution ( PBS ) for 10 min at room 520 temperature . Primary and secondary antibody incubations were carried out in PBS / 10 % FBS 521 supplemented with saponin at 0 . 2 % for 1h at room temperature . Cells were rinsed twice in 522 PBS , twice in water and mounted with Dapi Fluoromount - G ( Electron Microscopy Science ) . 523 Image acquisition was performed using a LSM780 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) with a 524 63X / 1 . 4 NA oil objective or a 40X / 1 . 4 NA oil objective . Cell numbers and individual cells 525 respective mean fluorescence intensities and area were obtained using ImageJ . 526 527 Virus titration analysis of cell supernatants 528 Extracellular medium was collected from infected cell cultures and serially diluted in 96 well 529 plates ( 10 −1 to 10 −8 ) . Dilutions were subsequently used to inoculate in triplicates HeLa WT cells 530 seeded at 6x10 4 cells / well in 96 - well plates . Cells were incubated at 37°C for 44h , fixed with 531 10 % paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet . TCID50 / ml was calculated using the 532 Spearman & Kärber algorithm . 533 534 Vesicle isolation 535 HeLa wildtype ( WT ) , LC3 3KO and GAB 3KO cells were infected with PV for 1h at MOI 5 , 536 washed and kept in serum - free DMEM / high glucose for 8h . Supernatants obtained from one 537 well of a 6 - well plate ( 1 . 5mL , ~ 500000 cells ) were harvested and centrifuged at 1000g for 538 10min , then at 20000g for 30min . Pellets were either resuspended in 1X loading buffer and 539 analyzed by Western Blot , or resuspend in RNA lysis buffer and processed for RT - PCR . 540 541 Quantitative ( q ) PCR analysis 542 Cell supernatants and cell lysates were harvested at specific time points and lysed using RNA 543 lysis buffer provided in the RNA isolation kit ( Quick - RNA Microprep Kit , Zymo Research ) .

( C ) Percentage of tomograms containing 927 ALM - associated protein filament bundles in DMSO treated WT cells ( N = 34 ) , in MRT68921 928 treated WT cells ( N = 10 ) and in MRT68921 + Vps34 - IN1 treated WT cells ( N = 20 ) , compared 929 to LC3 ( N = 17 ) and GABARAP ( N = 13 ) 3KO cells . ( D ) Subtomogram average of the filaments 930 at 18 . 5 Å resolution . ( E ) Fourier shell correlation curves for unmasked , masked , and phase - 931 randomized ( beyond 31 Å ) half - sets . The corrected curve , equalling 0 . 143 at 18 . 5 Å resolution , 932 is based on Chen et al 55 as implemented in subTOM . 933 934 37 935 Figure S7 : Comparison of the ALM - associated filament with a selection of known 936 filament structures . Top row : isosurface representations of the subtomogram average of the 937 ALM - associated protein filament from this study , and one representative of each of several 938 classes of cellular protein filaments with known structure . In the lower row , the ALM - associated 939 filament is shown in yellow , and semitransparent yellow when fitted to each of the other 940 filaments using UCSF Chimera’s Fit in Map function 41 . Prior to comparison , all filaments were 941 resampled to the same voxel size and filtered to 19 Å resolution . EMDB identifiers are indicated 942 below each volume . 943 944 945 38 946 Figure S8 : Schematic of the workflow for subtomogram averaging of the ALM - 947 associated filament . The schematic illustrates the major steps of the data processing starting 948 at filament tracing in the tomograms , and extraction of subtomograms along the filament axis , 949 through the several steps of classification , reextraction and averaging . 950 39 951 Figure 6 : The interplay between autophagy and enterovirus replication is dynamic , 952 selective and sequential . This model illustrates how remodeled cytoplasmic membranes act 953 as a platform for viral RNA replication and as a production line for virion assembly . 1 ) Capsid 954 proteins , produced as part of the membrane - associated viral polyprotein , assemble on the 955 replication membrane to the point of half - capsid intermediate . The antiviral drug Hydantoin 956 leads to premature capsid release from membranes . Away from the replication membrane , 957 capsids cannot be loaded with RNA . 2 ) The assembly pauses at the long - lived half - capsid 958 intermediate that carries out the “late proofreading” resulting in exclusive incorporation of newly 959 synthesized membrane - associated viral RNA 28 . The inhibition of VPS34 stalls the assembly at 960 the half - capsid checkpoint . 3 ) RNA - loading of the capsid leads to the formation of complete 961 virions tethered to the replication membrane . 4 ) Phagophores selectively package RNA - loaded 962 virions while excluding empty capsids . The virion - containing class of phagophores is distinct 963 from a second class of phagophores containing bundles of protein filaments . 5 ) A balance 964 between ULK1 - induced canonical autophagy and virus - induced proviral autophagy regulates 965 the level of virion production . Inhibition of remaining ULK1 activity by MRT68921 further 966 increases virion production . 967 968 40 969 970 971 972 973 974 975
