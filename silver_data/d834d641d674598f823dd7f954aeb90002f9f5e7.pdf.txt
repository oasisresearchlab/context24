Ideally , assays would allow for optimization of cell penetration in the cell type of interest early in the drug development process . However , few assays exist to compare cell penetration across different cell types , independent of drug function . In this work , we applied the chloroalkane penetration assay ( CAPA ) in seven mammalian cell lines as well as primary cells . Careful controls were used to ensure data could be compared across cell lines . We compared the penetration of several peptides and drug - like oligonucleotides and saw significant differences among the cell lines . To help explain these differences , we quantified the relative activities of endocytosis pathways in these cell lines and correlated them with the penetration data . Based on these results , we knocked down clathrin in a cell line with an efficient permeability profile and observed reduced penetration of peptides , but not oligonucleotides . Finally , we used small - molecule endosomal escape enhancers and observed enhancement of cell penetration of some oligonucleotides , but only in some of the cell lines tested . CAPA data provide valuable points of comparison among different cell lines , including primary cells , for evaluating the cell penetration of various classes of peptides and oligonucleotides . Introduction More and more biotherapeutics are entering clinical trials and achieving FDA approval . These include macromolecules across diverse classes including peptides , proteins , siRNAs , and antisense oligonucleotides . 1 – 3 Most nucleic acid drugs and many newer peptide drugs have intracellular targets , but historically it has been challenging to maximize the cell penetration of these drug classes . Measuring the cell penetration efficiency of a biotherapeutic in parallel with measuring its cellular activity can be highly beneficial for developing analogs with improved efficacy , and the earlier such information is used to guide development , the better . However , measuring cell penetration of biomolecules is not straightforward . In recent years , chemical biologists have developed a variety of strategies for quantifying passive penetration , total cellular uptake , and cytosolic / nuclear penetration with different detection methods including fluorescence microscopy , 4 – 7 mass - spectrometry , 8 – 13 NMR , 14 flow cytometry , 15 – 17 FACS , 18 , 19 qPCR , 20 luminescence , 21 , 22 or ELISA . 23 For cell - based assays , the choice of cell line is critical and measurement with different methods and / or in different cell lines can lead to different results . 24 – 27 In addition , model cell lines such as HeLa are often convenient , but they do not always recapitulate normal cellular physiology . Further , many drugs require selective delivery to specific cell types that are particularly therapeutically relevant . However , there are few reliable methods to compare cell penetration across different cell lines , particularly for quantitative comparisons and for comparisons of cytosolic / nuclear penetration that are not affected by endosomally trapped material . Most biotherapeutics including peptides and RNA therapeutics are known to enter mammalian cells by endocytosis . 28 – 30 Endocytosis is an energy - dependent process by which compounds are engulfed by the plasma membrane and are initially trapped in vesicles called early endosomes . 31 – 33 Early endosomes mature into late endosomes and eventually fuse with lysosomes , where most natural biomolecules are degraded . This process is sometimes termed “non - productive uptake” because material may become associated with the cell but cannot escape endosomes to affect their target ( s ) in the cytosol and / or nucleus . For some biotherapeutics , small amounts of the trapped material escape endosomes by poorly defined processes , leading to activity in the cytosol and / or nucleus . 30 This process is sometimes termed “productive uptake . ” The roles of different endocytosis pathways in biotherapeutic uptake have been explored , commonly by using chemical inhibitors which provide only moderate pathway specificity and thus often lead to contradictory results . 34 – 36 The most well - studied endocytosis pathways are macropinocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and caveolin - mediated endocytosis . 33 Established markers for these pathways include high - molecular - weight dextran for macropinocytosis , 33 , 37 , 38 transferrin for clathrin - mediated endocytosis , 33 , 39 – 41 and cholera toxin subunit B for caveolin - mediated endocytosis . 42 , 43 , 34 Importantly , different cell lines have different basal rates for each of these pathways , 33 which could partially explain the differences in biomolecule uptake , cytosolic penetration , and activity observed in different cell lines . 27 We were interested in comparing the relative degrees of cell penetration of peptide and oligonucleotide therapeutics across different cell lines , and we sought to correlate those results to the basal rates of endocytosis in those cell lines . To do so , we employed the Chloroalkane Penetration Assay ( CAPA ) developed in 2017 in the Kritzer lab . 15 , 44 , 45 CAPA is a high - throughput assay that exclusively reports on the productive uptake of a compound . CAPA relies on HaloTag , 46 an enzyme that covalently reacts with a small chloroalkane tag . Cells are induced to express HaloTag either in the cytosol or in the nucleus , so that CAPA signal is exclusively attributed to material that accessed the cytosol or nucleus . Compounds - of - interest are prepared with a small chloroalkane tag ( ct - compound ) and cells are treated with serial dilutions of the ct - compound ( pulse step ) . After a specific incubation time , cells are washed and chased with chloroalkane - tagged tetramethylrhodamine ( ct - TAMRA ) that readily enters cells and reacts with any HaloTag that was unreacted in the pulse step . Finally , unreacted dye is washed out and fluorescence is measured using benchtop flow cytometry . In - plate controls include untreated cells which represent background ( 0 % fluorescence ) and cells treated with only ct - TAMRA which represent 100 % fluorescence . These controls allow the flow cytometry data to be normalized and fit with a sigmoidal curve that provides a “CP 50 ” value , the concentration of ct - compound at which 50 % of cytosolic / nuclear HaloTag was blocked in the pulse step . The smaller the CP 50 , the more cell - penetrant the ct - compound . CAPA has been broadly adopted in industry and academia , and it has been successfully applied to peptides , 15 , 47 – 50 antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs with different lengths and chemical modifications , 45 , 51 , 52 cyclotides , 53 peptidomimetic macrocycles , 54 – 56 PROTACs , 57 and lipid nanoparticle - mediated delivery of proteins . 58 It has even been adapted for 3D tissue models to measure deep penetration of biotherapeutics , 59 and for bacterial cells to evaluate the bacterial penetration of small molecules . 60 We recently reported the ability to use adeno - associated virus to deliver HaloTag to different cellular compartments and different cell types . 45 Building on this work , we sought to employ CAPA in many different cell lines , including primary cells , in order to investigate the dependence of cell penetration of peptide and oligonucleotide therapeutics on cell type and basal rates of different endocytosis pathways . Results CAPA in seven different mammalian cell lines In order to carry out CAPA in a cell line of interest , a HaloTag expression construct needs to be delivered . For this work , we chose to deliver HaloTag fused to GFP and histone 2B , because this was the most robust adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) construct in our hands and because nuclear and cytosolic penetration have shown very similar patterns in prior data with peptides and oligonucleotides . 15 , 45 We delivered this construct to seven different cell lines using previously described AAV vectors . 45 The cell lines were chosen to represent different cell types , tissues of origin , and different reported susceptibilities to peptide and / or oligonucleotide therapeutics . 26 , 27 After transduction , we observed a shift in green fluorescence compared to non - transduced cells , indicating that the fusion construct was expressed in all seven cell lines ( Figure 1A and SI Figure 3 ) . To obtain broadly comparable levels of HaloTag expression , we empirically optimized transduction conditions , including multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) and exposure times , for each cell line ( SI Tables 1 - 2 ) . For example , U2OS cells required a MOI of 10 3 and 24 hours of incubation , while HepG2 cells required a MOI of 10 6 and 48 hours of incubation to produce a comparable GFP expression profile . We next verified that active HaloTag was being produced by labeling cells with ct - TAMRA , similar to the chase step of CAPA . We observed a shift in red fluorescence for transduced cells following incubation with ct - TAMRA compared to transduced , non - labeled cells ( Figure 1B ) . Having verified that active HaloTag was present , we then sought to empirically measure the concentration at which HaloTag would get saturated with ct - TAMRA , in order to ensure CAPA experiments used sufficient ct - TAMRA in the chase step ( Figure 1C and SI Figure 4 ) . For this experiment , serial dilutions of ct - TAMRA were added to HaloTag - expressing cells . We defined SAT 50 as the concentration of ct - TAMRA required to produce half - maximal cellular labeling – the concentration required to saturate 50 % of the expressed HaloTag . Despite optimization , there were some differences among the cell lines for their green fluorescence distributions ( GFP expression ) , red fluorescence distributions following ct - TAMRA labeling ( active HaloTag levels ) , and SAT 50 values ( ct - dye required to saturate 50 % of the expressed HaloTag ) . As described below , the differences were small enough that , with additional controls , we concluded that we could reasonably compare CAPA results across these different cell lines . We carried out CAPA experiments for a panel of six compounds ( SI Table 3 ) : two cell - penetrating peptides ( ct - R9W and ct - Tat ) , a hydrocarbon - stapled peptide ( ct - SAHB ) , 61 an antisense oligonucleotide with phosphorothioate backbone and 2’ - methoxyethyl modified sugars corresponding to the FDA - approved drug nusinersen ( ct - nusinersen ) , a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer ( ct - PMO ) , and a small molecule that commonly used as a control ( ct - W ; compounds further described in SI Table 3 ) . Informed by our prior work applying CAPA to peptide and oligonucleotide therapeutics , we tested two different time points : 4 - hour incubations for ct - R9W , ct - Tat , ct - SAHB , and ct - W ( SI Figures 5 and 7 ) and 24 - hour incubations for ct - nusinersen , ct - PMO , ct - R9W , and ct - W ( SI Figures 6 and 8 ) . The CP 50 values of each compound in each of the cell lines are shown in Figure 2 , and SI Table 12 . Most CP 50 values for the same compound across different cell lines differed from each other with statistical significance ( SI Tables 4 - 11 ) . Among the cell lines tested , we observed that the pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa - 2 was most permissive for cell penetration of both peptide and oligonucleotide therapeutics , and HEK293T cells were least permissive . As mentioned above , transduction conditions were optimized for uniform production of HaloTag but there were still some differences among the cell lines ( Figure 1A , SI Figure 3 ) . Having observed different CP 50 values for the same compound across different cell types , we next sought to investigate the extent to which these values correlated with differences in HaloTag expression . If CP 50 values and HaloTag expression were not correlated , then the CP 50 values likely reflected intrinsic properties of those cell lines relevant for drug delivery . First , we compared data from cells gated broadly for HaloTag - GFP expression ( the normal gate applied in CAPA , SI Figure 3 , SI Figure 9 , SI Table 13 ) 15 , 44 to data from cells gated with a narrower green fluorescence gate ( Figure 2 , SI Figure 3 , SI Table 12 ) . The narrower gate effectively standardized the range of HaloTag expression across the different cell lines . Importantly , the narrower gate altered the absolute CP 50 values but they did not change the relative CP 50 values for any compounds compared across different cell lines . There were also differences in the concentration of ct - dye required to saturate the expressed HaloTag ( SAT 50 values , Figure 1C ) which depends on HaloTag expression levels but also ct - dye permeability . To further examine whether the CP 50 values were dependent on HaloTag expression levels , we plotted the CP 50 values of each ct - compound against the SAT 50 values for every cell line ( SI Figures 10 , 11 ) and tested whether there was a linear relationship between them . The plots and the R 2 values for linear curve fits showed that there were not linear relationships between the CP 50 and SAT 50 values . These independent controls indicated that differences among the CP 50 values across different cell lines were not primarily due to different HaloTag levels in those cell lines . We were surprised by how different the CP 50 values were among the cell lines , even for the small - molecule control ct - W which is passively penetrant . Even for ct - W , plots of CP 50 values against the mean levels of HaloTag - GFP present in each cell line showed no linear relationship ( SI Figure 12 ) . In fact , there were cell lines with similar CP 50 for ct - W , but different mean levels of HaloTag ( HeLa , Saos - 2 , BxPC3 ) and cell lines with similar average levels of HaloTag expression , but different CP 50 values ( MIA PaCa - 2 , BxPC3 , HepG2 ) . The same was true for comparing CP 50 values and SAT 50 values for ct - W – no linear relationships were observed , cell lines with similar SAT 50 values had different CP 50 values , and cell lines with similar CP 50 values had different SAT 50 values ( SI Figures 10 , 11 ) . These comparisons provided further evidence that the different CP 50 values represent different intrinsic properties of each cell line , such as penetration and distribution of compounds , nonspecific or specific binding to cellular components , cell morphology and surface area , and most importantly different endocytosis activities ( see below ) . While some differences in CP 50 values across cell lines may arise due to differential expression of HaloTag , these controls support the conclusion that comparing CP 50 values across cell lines highlights differences in the intrinsic cell penetration properties of those cell lines . Figure 1 . HaloTag expression in seven human cell lines . ( A ) Expression of HaloTag - GFP was measured as a shift in green fluorescence of AAV - transduced cells ( green ) compared to non - transduced cells ( grey ) . ( B ) Expression of functional HaloTag was measured as a shift in red fluorescence of transduced cells treated with 5 µ M ct - TAMRA for 15 min ( red ) compared to transduced , non - labeled cells ( grey ) . Flow cytometry histograms show representative data from one of at least three independent trials . ( C ) Transduced cells were pulsed with only optiMEM for 4 h or 24 h and then chased with serial dilutions of ct - TAMRA for 15 min . See SI Figure 4 for similar saturation curves upon 4 h incubation . Data are averages from three independent trials and error bars show standard error of the mean . SAT 50 values are reported as the average and standard error of the mean from three independent curve fits to three independent trials . Figure 2 .

These values are derived from raw data and curve fits shown in SI Figure 6 . CP 50 values are reported as the average and standard error of the mean from three independent curve fits to three independent trials . Numerical values of CP 50 s are provided in SI Table 12 and statistical significance tests are provided in SI Tables 4 - 11 . Correlating CAPA data with endocytosis activities To account for differences in cell penetration observed among different cell lines , an attractive hypothesis is that the cell lines have different relative endocytosis activities . To correlate cell penetration and endocytosis , we carried out uptake assays in each cell line with known markers for three different endocytosis pathways . Specifically , we treated cells with fluorescently labeled high - molecular - weight dextran , transferrin , and cholera toxin subunit B , which are markers for uptake via macropinocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and caveolin - mediated endocytosis , respectively . After 1 hour of incubation at 37°C , cells were washed and fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry and normalized to background to generate values in relative fluorescence units ( SI Table 14 , SI Figure 13 ) . Control experiments performed at 4°C showed reduced uptake levels for all three processes , as expected ( SI Figure 13 ) . There were many differences in the relative activities of each pathway across the seven cell lines ( Figures 3A , 3B ) . HEK293T cells had , by far , the highest uptake of all markers – for all three pathways , HEK293T cells had roughly double the uptake compared to the next - most - active cell line . Among the rest of the cell lines studied , Saos - 2 and MIA PaCa - 2 cells had the highest macropinocytosis activity , U2OS and MIA PaCa - 2 cells had the highest clathrin - mediated endocytosis activity , and BxPC3 cells had the highest caveolin - mediated endocytosis activity . HepG2 cells had the lowest macropinocytosis and clathrin - mediated endocytosis activities , and U2OS cells had the lowest caveolin - mediated endocytosis activity . The relative endocytosis activities in the cell lines appeared to explain some , but not all , of the CAPA results . For example , the greatest penetration ( lowest CP 50 values ) were observed in MIA PaCa - 2 cells for all peptides and for ct - nusinersen , and greater penetration was also observed in U2OS cells for the peptides and in Saos - 2 cells for ct - nusinersen ( Figures 2B , 2C ) . These were also the cell lines with the highest macropinocytosis and clathrin - mediated endocytosis activities ( Figures 3A , 3B ) . Similarly , the HepG2 and BxPC3 cell lines had poorer penetration overall ( higher CP 50 values ) and these were also the cell lines with less macropinocytosis and clathrin - mediated endocytosis activities . Interestingly , HEK293T cells had the highest endocytosis activities for all three pathways , yet had among the poorest penetration ( highest CP 50 values ) of all the cell lines tested . CAPA reports on cytosolic / nuclear penetration , so high CP 50 values in a cell line with high endocytosis activity may suggest an unusually low degree of endosomal escape . Because of these outlying features , and the common observance of both adherent and suspended cells in HEK293T cultures , we omitted HEK293T cells from subsequent analyses . To look for global correlations between individual endocytosis pathway activities and cell penetration , we plotted the CP 50 values for each ct - compound versus the relative activity measurements for individual endocytosis pathways in each cell line ( Figure 3C and SI Figure 14 ) . There were significant correlations for some of the ct - compounds with specific endocytosis pathways . Specifically , the polycationic cell - penetrating peptides ct - R9W and ct - Tat had linear correlations with clathrin - mediated endocytosis activity , implying that cell penetration directly depends on uptake via this pathway . A similar correlation was observed for ct - nusinersen and macropinocytosis activity ( Figure 3C and SI Figure 14 ) , and this correlation was even stronger if the U2OS cell line was omitted from the analysis . For the ct - PMO , there was a slight correlation with caveolin - mediated endocytosis activity ( SI Figure 14 ) . For the rest of the correlation plots for other ct - compounds and endocytosis activities , there were no linear relationships observed between endocytosis activities and cell penetration . Figure 3 . Correlation of cell penetration data with endocytosis activities . ( A ) Relative activities of different endocytosis pathways in different cell lines were measured using 1 mg / mL TAMRA - labeled high - molecular - weight dextran for macropinocytosis , 1 mg / mL TAMRA - labeled transferrin for clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and 5 µ g / mL AlexaFluor - 647 - labeled cholera toxin B for caveolin - mediated endocytosis after 1 hour incubation at 37°C .

( C ) Plots examining possible correlations between cell penetration ( CP 50 , lower values indicate greater cell penetration ) and endocytosis activities in six of the cell lines for ct - R9W and ct - nusinersen . Remaining plots are shown in SI Figure 14 . RFU and CP 50 values are reported using the average and standard error of the mean from three independent trials . Effects of endosomal escape enhancers Some prior work has shown that chloroquine can enhance the endosomal escape of peptides 62 and oligonucleotides . 63 , 64 So , we next examined the effects of chloroquine on cell penetration in BxPC3 cells , one of the least permissive cell lines tested . Unexpectedly , co - incubation of ct - compounds with 60 µ M chloroquine in BxPC3 cells did not increase cell penetration for any peptides or oligonucleotides tested ( SI Figures 15 & 16 , SI Table 15 ) . Most compounds tested , including ct - W , showed a two - to - three - fold increase in CP 50 value upon chloroquine treatment , indicating poorer cell penetration . Interestingly , the CP 50 of the stapled peptide ct - SAHB increased from 0 . 88 ± 0 . 20 µ M to 6 . 44 ± 0 . 17 µ M in the presence of chloroquine , indicating a mechanism of cell penetration that is particularly sensitive to alterations in lysosomal function ( SI Figure 15A ) . Several recent papers have reported compounds that more selectively enhance endosomal escape , especially for antisense oligonucleotides . Such compounds have been called oligonucleotide enhancer compounds ( OECs ) . We chose OECs UNC10217938A 6 , 65 and SH - BC - 893 66 to examine their effects on cell penetration of ct - nusinersen and ct - PMO in BxPC3 and U2OS cells . We chose these two cell lines because they were among the cell lines with higher CP 50 values , and we wanted to examine whether OECs could improve cell penetration as measured by CAPA . In BxPC3 cells , co - incubation of ct - nusinersen with 10 µ M UNC10217938A or 5 µ M SH - BC - 893 for 24h decreased the CP 50 value by roughly 30 % ( Figure 4A , SI Table 16 , SI Figure 17 ) . In U2OS cells , 10 µ M UNC10217938A decreased the CP 50 value for ct - nusinersen by roughly 66 % ( from 0 . 50 ± 0 . 02 µ Μ to 0 . 17 ± 0 . 08 µ M ) but 5 µ M SH - BC - 893 had no effect ( Figure 4B , SI Table 17 , SI Figure 19 ) . Neither OEC had a significant effect on the measured CP 50 value for ct - PMO or the small molecule control ct - W ( SI Figure 18B ) . These data suggest that OECs can enhance cell penetration of drug - like oligonucleotides , but moderately and in a compound - and cell - specific manner . Figure 4 . Effects of oligonucleotide enhancer compounds ( OECs ) on cell penetration . Cell penetration of ct - nusinersen and ct - PMO was measured in the absence or presence of OECs UNC10217938A ( 10 µ M ) and SH - BC - 893 ( 5 µ M ) . Selected data are shown here for key comparisons in BxPC3 cells ( A ) and in U2OS cells ( B ) . CP 50 values are derived from raw data and curve fits shown in SI Figures 17 , 19 . CP 50 values are reported as the average and standard error of the mean from three independent curve fits to three independent trials . Significance testing for these data are found in SI Tables 18 - 21 . Effects of clathrin knockdown Prior work has commonly used endocytosis inhibitors , including amiloride , rottlerin , chlorpromazine , dynasore , methyl - β - cyclodextrin , and nystatin , to attempt to selectively block specific endocytosis pathways . However , these compounds are notoriously non - specific . 33 , 34 , 67 We sought a more specific means of inhibiting a particular pathway , to further examine the relationships between specific endocytosis pathways and cell penetration as measured by CAPA . We chose to knock down clathrin using small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , which was shown to be a much more robust and selective approach . 34 We carried out these experiments in MIA PaCa - 2 cells since they had the highest levels of clathrin - mediated endocytosis and the lowest CP 50 values ( greatest cell penetration ) in general . Transfection conditions and clathrin knockdown were optimized and verified using Western blot ( SI Figure 20 ) . Upon clathrin knockdown , there was a decrease in the uptake of transferrin , the clathrin - mediated endocytosis maker . The uptake of dextran was not affected much , while the caveolin - mediated pathway seemed to get up - regulated as seen by the significant increase in the uptake of cholera toxin subunit B ( Figure 5B ) . Cell penetration of the ct - peptides was impaired significantly in the absence of clathrin ( Figure 5C , SI Figure 21A ) after 4 hours of incubation . The biggest difference was seen for hydrocarbon - stapled peptide ct - SAHB , whose CP 50 increased by more than 5 - fold ( SI Table 24 ) , while the penetration of ct - W was not significantly different . After 24 hours of incubation in MIA PaCa - 2 cells with clathrin knockdown , the CP 50 values of the ct - oligonucleotides and ct - R9W appeared to increase , but with a broad spread of values among replicates ( Figure 5D , SI Figure 21B , SI Table 24 ) . Figure 5 . Measuring the effects of clathrin knockdown on cell penetration of ct - compounds in MIA PaCa - 2 cells . ( A ) Schematic of experimental plan . ( B ) Effect of clathrin knockdown on uptake of markers of different endocytosis pathways . RFU values are reported as the average and standard error of the mean from three independent trials . ( C ) CP 50 values for the indicated ct - compounds upon clathrin knockdown after 4 hours of incubation . ( D ) CP 50 values for the indicated ct - compounds upon clathrin knockdown after 24 hours of incubation . CP 50 values are reported as the average and standard error of the mean from three independent curve fits to three independent trials , shown in SI Figure 21 . Numerical CP 50 values are shown in SI Table 24 . An unpaired t - test was used ( SI Table 25 , 26 ) to calculate p values for data in panels B - D . CAPA in primary cells After comparing cell penetration in seven cultured cell lines using CAPA , we hypothesized that AAV introduction of HaloTag would also allow us to measure cell penetration in primary cells . We used the methods described above to measure endocytosis activities in human umbilical vein epithelial cells ( HUVECs , SI Figure 22 ) and we transduced them with AAV ( SI Figure 23 ) to enable CAPA measurements for a panel of ct - compounds ( Figure 6A , 6B ) . The CAPA data revealed that HUVECs are similarly permissive as many cultured cell lines in terms of cell penetration of peptide and oligonucleotide therapeutics . We were interested whether the data from HUVEC cells would match the correlations observed with cultured cell lines . Penetration of ct - R9W and ct - Tat correlated with transferrin uptake activity ( SI Figure 14 ) , as observed in cultured cells . However , penetration of ct - nusinersen in HUVEC cells did not correlate with dextran uptake , contrasting with results from most of the cultured cells . We also tested the effects of OEC UNC10217938A on ct - nusinersen penetration in HUVEC cells ( Figure 6C , SI Table 27 ) . UNC01217938A improved the CP 50 of ct - nusinersen by over 50 % in this primary cell line ( SI Figure 24 , SI Table 27 ) . Figure 6 . CAPA in primary cells . ( A ) CP 50 values for the indicated ct - compounds in HUVECs after 4 hours of incubation . ( B ) CP 50 values for the indicated ct - compounds in HUVECs after 24 hours of incubation . ( C ) CP 50 values for ct - nusinersen and ct - W in the absence or presence of 10 μM UNC10217938A . All data show results from three independent trials and error bars show standard error of the mean . CP 50 values are reported as the average and standard error of the mean from three independent curve fits to three independent trials . CP 50 values in panel C were derived from curve fits shown in SI Figure 24 . Discussion Evaluating cell penetration in different cell types is crucial for the development of more effective biotherapeutics . The compounds in our panel included cationic cell - penetrating peptides , a hydrocarbon - stapled peptide , and two classes of synthetic oligonucleotides . All compounds showed differences in cell penetration in different cell lines , which was observed in prior literature . 24 – 27 For example , studies showed that the total uptake of fluorescently - labeled CPPs 24 or fluorescently - labeled peptides and peptidomimetics 27 was different when measured in different cell lines . Similar results were observed for the CPP - mediated delivery of GFP in different cell lines . 25 Linnane et al . showed differences among cell lines in the total uptake of a label - free ASO by immunofluorescence using an anti - oligonucleotide antibody . 26 Our results add substantially to these prior works because CAPA measures productive uptake of biomolecules , in this case material that reached the nucleus of cells , rather than total cellular uptake . Among the cell lines tested , we found the pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa - 2 to be among the most permissive cell lines for compound penetration , while the pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3 was one of the least permissive cell lines ( Figure 2 ) . This can be explained partially by the fact that MIA PaCa - 2 cells have an activating KRas mutation while BxPC3 cells have wild - type KRas , which was observed by others to enhance endocytosis and cell penetration of externally added compounds . 26 , 27 , 68 Our data add to the ongoing examination of the mechanisms of cell penetration for cationic cell - penetrating peptides ( such as Tat and polyarginine , both tested in this work ) . 69 Such peptides are well - documented to enter cells by endocytosis , 70 – 76 but different pathways of endocytosis have been proposed to be responsible for their initial uptake . Evidence has documented that they can be taken up by macropinocytosis , 77 – 80 clathrin - mediated endocytosis , 79 , 81 , 82 or caveolin - mediated endocytosis , 83 – 85 or all three pathways . 86 Direct translocation across the membrane has also been proposed , and appears to occur most noticeably at higher peptide concentrations . 5 , 87 – 90 In this work , we obtained data across six different cell lines which show a linear correlation between clathrin - mediated endocytosis activity and cell penetration of ct - R9W and ct - Tat ( Figure 3C ) . We observed a similar trend for macropinocytosis activity , especially for ct - R9W in all cell lines except Saos - 2 ( Figure 3C ) . No relationship was observed between the levels of caveolin - mediated endocytosis and cell penetration of ct - R9W and ct - Tat , and thus our data agree with studies that rule out caveolin - mediated endocytosis as a relevant uptake pathway for cationic peptides . 81 The notion that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a primary uptake route for CPPs is also supported by our CAPA data upon clathrin knockdown in MIA PaCa - 2 cells ( Figure 5C ) , where the CP 50 values of ct - Tat and ct - R9W increased by ~ 3 - fold . Hydrocarbon - stapled peptides like ct - SAHB were reported to enter Jurkat T cells by macropinocytosis . 61 , 90 – 92 Our data do not show a direct correlation between cell penetration of ct - SAHB and macropinocytosis activity in the cell lines tested . In fact , we do not see a linear correlation with any of the endocytosis pathways studied , although knockdown of clathrin in MIA PaCa - 2 cells reduced cell penetration of ct - SAHB by more than 5 - fold ( Figure 5C ) . Taken with prior work , our data indicate that the primary uptake route for hydrocarbon - stapled peptides may vary among different cell types . Our data also add to the ongoing effort to understand cell penetration of chemically modified oligonucleotide therapeutics . 93 – 95 Antisense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) have been shown to enter cells by endocytosis – more specifically , phosphorothioate ASOs have been reported to enter cells via macropinocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , or caveolin - mediated endocytosis . 95 – 97 Some work has shown that phosphorothioate ASOs interact with cell - surface proteins including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , 98 which is known to stimulate macropinocytosis , 99 but other work showed they also can interact with stabilin receptors that internalize them via clathrin - coated pits . 100 , 101 Our data show a direct relationship between higher macropinocytosis levels and higher cell penetration efficiency for the phosphorothioate ASO ct - nusinersen across most cell lines tested ( Figure 3C ) . We did not observe correlations between cell penetration of ct - nusinersen and clathrin - mediated endocytosis activity or caveolin - mediated endocytosis activity . This is also supported by our clathrin knockdown experiment in MIA PaCa - 2 cells , where the CP 50 of ct - nusinersen did not change significantly upon clathrin knockdown . This also reinforces the notion that the different pathways work in synergy , and they complement each other , especially when one is unavailable i . e . clathrin knockdown . 95 Our analysis from this work agrees with the findings of Koller et al , 102 who showed that clathrin knockdown did not alter functional activity of ASOs . 102 For the phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer ( PMO ) , we only observed a slight correlation with caveolin - mediated endocytosis activity ; this agrees with some prior results as well . 103 The different observations between the PS - ASO and the PMO highlight that the primary mechanisms of entry for different chemically modified oligonucleotides are likely different . We excluded HEK293T cells from the cross - cell - line analysis because they appeared to have unusually high levels of endocytosis , yet also had poor cell penetration ( high CP 50 values ) . These data suggest that although HEK293T cells have more rapid uptake than many other cell lines , they may have slow endosomal escape rates – this finding matches some prior work in this cell line . 104 Moreover , our CAPA results in HEK293T cells also agree with the conclusions drawn by Arora and coworkers using uptake assays based on dye fluorescence . 27 That study found that the total uptake of several classes of cell - penetrant peptides , including Tat , was similarly poor in HEK293T and BxPC3 cells ( both expressing wild - type Ras ) . Our data focusing on the endosomal escape efficiency agree with these observations , as the CP 50 values for ct - Tat and ct - R9W are highest in BxPC3 and HEK293T cells , while for ct - SAHB the highest CP 50 is observed in HEK293T cells . Clathrin knockdown in MIA PaCa - 2 cells decreased the uptake of transferrin , as seen by others . 105 , 106 Recently , Itagaki et al . noted an increase , rather than a decrease , in the uptake of fluorescently - labeled transferrin when they performed a clathrin heavy chain knockdown in HeLa cells . 34 During the same experiment , they saw no effect in the uptake of dextran , with matches our observations in MIA PaCa - 2 cells , and they also saw a decrease in the uptake of cholera toxin B in HeLa while we observed an increase in MIA PaCa - 2 . These comparisons highlight that even the effects of direct perturbations such as clathrin knockdown can vary depending on the cell line used . Discrepancies between uptake activities and cell penetration are typically ascribed to efficiency of endosomal escape . We sought to enhance escape efficiency in one of the least permissive cell lines , BxPC3 , using chloroquine . Chloroquine is an endolytic agent that has been shown to enhance the endosomal escape of CPPs 62 and RNA therapeutics 63 , 64 by disrupting endosome integrity once it gets protonated at lower pH . 107 – 110 Surprisingly , we did not observe lower CP 50 values ( which would signify improved endosomal escape ) for any compounds in BxPC3 cells in the presence of chloroquine . In fact , there was a significant increase in CP 50 for ct - SAHB and ct - nusinersen ( SI Figure 15 ) . There have been other instances where addition of chloroquine either barely enhanced or even reduced DNA delivery and gene expression . 111 , 112 Chloroquine is also a lysosmotropic agent that can alter lysosomal pH and can prevent material from getting degraded . This raises the possibility that part of the CAPA signal derives from degraded material , and ct - SAHB and ct - nusinersen are more protected from degradation in the presence of chloroquine . While the CAPA data for these compounds do not resemble cases in which we have documented degradation artifacts , 45 , 58 it remains a possibility that cannot be ruled out . Another explanation is that chloroquine has been shown to inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis , 33 , 113 which our data ( Figure 5 , SI Figure 14 ) indicate is particularly important for cell penetration of polycationic peptides and nusinersen . Unlike chloroquine , the oligonucleotide escape enhancer compound UNC10217938A improved cell penetration in several cell lines tested , including primary HUVECs . Thus , such selective compounds may be more fruitful avenues for continued efforts in enhancing cell penetration of oligonucleotide therapeutics . The experiments described in this work use standard cell culture protocols and will be easily expanded to additional cultured cell lines and primary cells of interest . The AAV plasmids are publicly available from Addgene , further facilitating the use of CAPA for cell - line - specific applications . We anticipate that these methods will be broadly useful for drug development , especially for peptide and oligonucleotide therapeutics targeting very specific tissues or cellular populations .
