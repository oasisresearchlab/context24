4240 Research Article Introduction Endocytosis of molecules from the extracellular milieu can occur through distinct internalization routes . The clathrin - and caveolin - mediated pathways , which require dynamin , a large GTPase responsible for the scission of newly formed vesicles at the plasma membrane , are by far the best characterized ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Nabi and Le , 2003 ) . Endocytic mechanisms that occur independently of clathrin and caveolin but also require functional dynamin , ( Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) , for example the internalization of interleukin 2 ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) , high - affinity immunoglobulin E receptor ( Fattakhova et al . , 2006 ) and  c cytokine receptor ( Sauvonnet et al . , 2005 ) , have also been identified . However , growing numbers of molecules are reported to be internalized in a dynamin - independent manner , such as GPI - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) ( Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) , major histocompatibility complex I ( MHCI ) ( Radhakrishna and Donaldson , 1997 ) and various bacterial toxins and viruses ( Damm et al . , 2005 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 2008 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 2002 ) . Dynamin - independent internalization occurs through specific compartments , whose formation and dynamics are regulated by small GTPases . Two main routes of cargo internalization have been identified : in HeLa cells , the Arf6 - dependent pathway regulates the entry of MHCI and CD59 ( Donaldson et al . , 2009 ) , and the CLIC – GEEC ( clathrin - independent carrier – GPI - AP - enriched early endosomal compartments ) pathway ( Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ; Mayor and Riezman , 2004 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) , which is regulated by Cdc42 , Arf1 and ARHGAP10 ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) . GEECs are required for the internalization of a variety of molecules , including GPI - anchored proteins ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) , cholera toxin ( at least in part ) ( Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ) and VacA toxin ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) , and , recently , GRAF1 ( GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase - 1 ) has been identified as a non - cargo marker ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) and proposed to be a regulator of this dynamic tubular compartment . The CLIC – GEEC pathway also internalizes a large fraction of the fluid phase into the cells ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . With the aim of identifying new proteins acting in the dynamin - independent pathways , we performed a survival - based sh - RNA screen in a cell line expressing a GPI - anchored diphtheria toxin ( DT ) receptor that guides DT entry in a dynamin - independent fashion ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) . PI3KC2 a ( phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase , class 2 , alpha polypeptide ) was identified as a positive regulator of DT internalization and further validated by survival assays and immunofluorescence analyses . PI3KC2 a belongs to the class II phosphoinositide 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) , comprising three proteins ( a ,  ,  ) , which are resistant to the classic PI3K inhibitors ( Domin et al . , 1997 ; Falasca and Maffucci , 2007 ) . PI3KC2 a is a high molecular weight monomer with a C2 domain at the C - terminus and a clathrin - binding domain at the N - terminus . PI3KC2 a has been implicated in several cellular processes , including clathrin - mediated endocytosis , ( Gaidarov et al . , 2005 ) , ATP - dependent priming of neurosecretory vesicles ( Meunier et al . , 2005 ; Wen et al . , 2008 ) , response to insulin stimulation ( Falasca et al . , 2007 ) and vascular smooth - muscle contraction ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) . Studies in vivo identified PI3P as the only product of PI3KC2 a , and it has been reported that insulin and Ca 2 + can induce PI3P production in a PI3KC2 a - dependent fashion at the plasma membrane and secretory vesicles , respectively ( Falasca et al . , 2007 ; Maffucci et al . , 2005 ; Wen et al . , 2008 ) . Our data indicate that PI3KC2 a also plays an essential role in the dynamin - independent physiological internalization processes by promoting recruitment of early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) to internalizing vesicles , a step required for the intracellular Accepted 12 August 2010 Journal of Cell Science 123 , 4240 - 4250 ©2010 . Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 071712 Summary Increasing evidence indicates that cellular uptake of several molecules can occur independently of functional dynamin , but the molecular players that regulate dynamin - independent endocytosis and the subsequent trafficking steps are still largely unknown . A survival - based short - hairpin ( sh ) RNA screen using a cell line expressing a diphtheria toxin receptor ( DTR , officially known as HBEGF ) anchored to GPI ( DTR – GPI ) , which internalizes diphtheria toxin ( DT , officially known as DTX ) in a dynamin - independent manner , identified PI3KC2 a , a class II phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , as a specific regulator of dynamin - independent DT internalization . We found that the internalization of several proteins that enter the cell through dynamin - independent pathways led to a relocalization of PI3KC2 a to cargo - positive vesicles . Furthermore , downregulation of PI3KC2 a impaired internalization of CD59 as well as fluid - phase endocytosis . Our data suggest a general role for PI3KC2 a in regulating physiologically relevant dynamin - independent internalization pathways by recruiting early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) to vesicular compartments , a step required for the intracellular trafficking of vesicles generated by dynamin - independent endocytic pathways .

Results Diphtheria toxin as a probe for dynamin - independent internalization pathways On the basis of previous results that has shown that several bacterial proteins can be successfully used to study the mechanisms of internalization and trafficking ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 2002 ) , we utilized the cellular toxicity of diphtheria toxin ( DT , also known as DTX ) to identify molecules required for its internalization . DT enters the cell through a heparin - binding EGF - like growth factor ( HB - EGF ) precursor ( Moya et al . , 1985 ; Naglich et al . , 1992 ; Simpson et al . , 1998 ) named the diphtheria toxin receptor ( DTR , officially known as HBEGF ) . After receptor binding , the toxin is delivered to early endosomes before it translocates to the cytosol , causing cell death ( Falnes and Sandvig , 2000 ) . It was reported previously that the tetracycline - regulated expression of a mutant form of dynamin I ( K44A ) in HeLa cells prevented cell intoxication , suggesting that DT enters the cell using a dynamin - dependent pathway ( Fig . 1 ) ( Lanzrein et al . , 1996 ; Skretting et al . , 1999 ) . However , when the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the DT receptor were replaced with a GPI anchor ( DTR – GPI ) , the induced expression of the DynK44A mutant did not prevent cell intoxication , suggesting that the modified DTR allowed DT internalization independently of dynamin ( Lanzrein et al . , 1996 ; Skretting et al . , 1999 ) . To visualize the internalization of DT in the presence or absence of mutant dynamin , we monitored the uptake of a nontoxic mutant of DT , CRM197 ( Uchida et al . , 1972 ) , coupled to a Cy3 fluorophore ( DT – Cy3 ) . In HeLa DynK44A cells , which express only the wild - type DT receptor , the induction of mutant dynamin prevented DT – Cy3 entry , and no intracellular fluorescence was detected at any of the time - points tested ( Fig . 1A , upper panel ; and data not shown ) . In agreement with previous results ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) , it appears that DynK44A expression prevented cell intoxication , and protein synthesis was not inhibited by toxin treatment ( Fig . 1B ) . By contrast , in HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells , which express a GPI - linked version of the DT receptor , DynK44A induction did not prevent DT – Cy3 internalization ( Fig . 1A , lower panel ) , as indicated by the intracellular fluorescence observed after DT – Cy3 treatment and by the sensitivity to intoxication with DT ( Fig . 1B ) . Similarly , the overexpression of a dominant - negative construct for Eps15 , which inhibits clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Carbone et al . , 1997 ) , also failed to prevent DT internalization in this cell line ( supplementary material Fig . S1A ) . Antibodies against DTR were internalized in a dynamin - independent manner ( supplementary material Fig . S1B ) and colocalized with DT – Cy3 both at the plasma membrane and in vesicular compartments ( supplementary material Fig . S1C ) . These data provide further evidence for dynamin - independent internalization of the toxin and its modified receptor . In HeLa cells expressing DynK44A and DTR – GPI , DT – Cy3 appeared in elongated structures emanating from the plasma membrane after 10 minutes of loading in the media ( Fig . 1C , left ) and accumulated in large vesicles at the perinuclear region of the cell by 20 – 30 minutes of continuous internalization ( Fig . 1C , right ) . At 10 minutes , in the cells expressing DynK44A , DT – Cy3 colocalized with molecules reported to internalize in a dynamin - independent manner , such as CD59 ( Naslavsky et al . , 2004 ) , CtxB , ( Glebov et al . , 2006 ) , MHCI ( Radhakrishna and Donaldson , 1997 ) and GPI – GFP ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) but not with 4241 PI3KC2 a in dynamin - independent pathways transferrin , a marker for clathrin - mediated ( and dynamin - mediated ) endocytosis ( Fig . 2 ) . These experiments indicate that DT internalization through a GPI - anchored receptor can be used to investigate internalization pathways occurring independently of dynamin . Downregulation of PI3KC2 a prevents cell intoxication In an attempt to identify the molecular components involved in dynamin - independent pathways , we designed a screen exploiting the cellular toxicity of DT and its ability to be internalized in a dynamin - independent way in HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e The screen , briefly described in the Material and Methods section , was based on cell survival after transfection of HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells with a library of sh - RNAs , followed by induction of DynK44A expression and intoxication with DT . As cell death occurs when the DT is internalized and transported to early endosomal compartments , genes that prevented cell intoxication when downregulated would potentially encode proteins involved in dynamin - independent DT internalization and trafficking from the plasma membrane to early endosomes . Among several proteins ( listed in supplementary material Table S1 ) , PI3KC2 a , a member of class II of the phosphoinositide 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) , was identified in the screen . To confirm the results of the screen , HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells were transfected with a pRETROSUPER – PI3KC2 a silencing construct ( pRS – PI3KC2 a ) , and cell survival was compared with that of cells transfected with an empty control vector as well as with that of cells not expressing mutant dynamin . Cells that downregulated PI3KC2 a while simultaneously expressing DynK44A showed improved survival after intoxication with DT to a much higher extent than control cells ( Fig . 3A , left ) . Similar results were obtained after transfecting the cells with a silencing construct , pGIPZ – PI3KC2 a , from an Open Biosystems library , which targets 4242 Journal of Cell Science 123 ( 24 ) a different sequence of the gene encoding PI3KC2 a , possibly ruling out off - target effects ( Fig . 3A , right ) . The silencing efficiency of the pRETROSUPER – PI3KC2 a and pGIPZ – PI3KC2 a constructs was tested by quantitative PCR and western blotting ( supplementary material Fig . S2A – D ) . Silencing of PI3KC2 a specifically reduces dynamin - independent DT internalization To validate further PI3KC2 a as a component in dynamin - independent pathways , we performed an internalization assay at a single - cell level . DT uptake and trafficking were followed by fluorescence microscopy using DT – Cy3 in cells transfected with the pGIPZ – PI3KC2 a or nonsilencing constructs , identified as GFP - positive cells . As shown in Fig . 3B , silencing of PI3KC2 a strongly reduced the DT – Cy3 fluorescence in cells that also expressed DynK44A . Quantitative analysis showed that the level of DT – Cy3 in sh - PI3KC2 a - transfected cells , analyzed by measuring the internalized fluorescence at 30 minutes , was reduced by ~ 70 % in comparison with nonsilencing transfected cells ( Fig . 3B , D ) . DT internalization was almost completely restored to wild - type levels when a silencing - resistant form of PI3KC2 a ( PI3KC2 a shRes ) was co - transfected with the shRNA construct ( Fig . 3C , D ) , thus confirming the role for PI3KC2 a in DT uptake . The silencing effect of the pGIPZ – PI3KC2 a construct on wild - type or the RNAi - resistant form of PI3KC2 a was tested by western blot ( supplementary material Fig . S2F ) . Importantly , the knockdown of PI3KC2 a did not interfere with the total DT – Cy3 fluorescence ( supplementary material Fig . S3A ) , measured after loading the DT – Cy3 at 4°C for 30 minutes . This indicates that the DT receptors are correctly transported to the plasma membrane in cells expressing the sh - PI3KC2 a construct and strongly suggests that the decreased DT – Cy3 fluorescence observed is due to a reduced DT – Cy3 internalization and / or trafficking . Of note , transferrin ( Tfn ) internalization was unaffected after downregulation of PI3KC2 a ( supplementary material Fig . S3B ) , suggesting a specific role for this protein in dynamin - independent endocytosis . Internalization of CD59 and fluid - phase endocytosis require PI3KC2 a To establish whether PI3KC2 a has a role in the internalization and / or trafficking of physiological proteins , we tested whether the internalization of CD59 , an endogenous GPI – AP found at the plasma membrane of several cell types , was dependent on PI3KC2 a . CD59 is internalized independently of dynamin ( Naslavsky et al . , 2004 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) , and co - internalization of CD59 - specific antibodies with DT – Cy3 in HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI indeed showed that CD59 and DT – Cy3 display similar trafficking patterns ( Fig . 2 ) . Internalization of CD59 in HeLa and HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells expressing sh - PI3KC2 a or a nonsilencing control was tested both by immunofluorescence and FACS analysis . Immunofluorescence analysis of cells probed with an antibody against CD59 for 20 minutes at 37°C showed that a major fraction of CD59 was retained at the plasma membrane in cells where PI3KC2 a was downregulated ( Fig . 4A ) . To quantify this effect , FACS analysis was performed in cells incubated with the antibody to CD59 for 10 or 20 minutes at 37°C ( Fig . 4B ) , and internalized CD59 was calculated as described in the Materials and Methods section . Downregulation of PI3KC2 a resulted in a small , but significant , decrease of CD59 internalization that could be partially rescued after introduction of the shRNA - resistant PI3KC2a Fig . 2 . DT – Cy3 colocalizes with molecules internalized by dynamin - independent pathways . DT – Cy3 was internalized into HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells for 10 minutes at 37°C . Tfn Alexa Fluor 488 , CtxB Alexa Fluor 488 as well as antibodies specific for MHCI and CD59 were co - internalized with DT – Cy3 .

Importantly , silencing of PI3KC2a did not affect the steady - state levels of CD59 at the plasma membrane , measured by loading CD59 antibodies at 4°C ( supplementary material Fig . S4A ) , indicating that the decreased CD59 internalization in cells transfected with sh - PI3KC2 a is not due to decreased CD59 at the plasma membrane . Furthermore , the early time - points ( 10 and 20 minutes ) used in this experiment rule out the possibility that PI3KC2 a interferes with CD59 recycling , further supporting a role for PI3KC2 a in CD59 internalization . We also tested whether PI3KC2 a participates in the uptake of the extracellular fluid that primarily occurs through clathrin - and dynamin - independent pathways ( Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ; Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) . Using direct fluorescence and a quantitative fluorimetric assay to measure internalized dextran , a marker commonly used to assay fluid - phase endocytosis , we observed that downregulation of PI3KC2 a resulted in a decrease of dextran internalization ( Fig . 4D , E ) . 4243 PI3KC2 a in dynamin - independent pathways These results indicate that PI3KC2 a can regulate the dynamin - independent internalization of endogenously expressed proteins as well as fluid - phase uptake , suggesting an important role for this protein in physiologically relevant pathways . DT internalization does not require other PI3Ks PI3Ks are lipid kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of the 3 (cid:2) position of the inositol ring . Eight PI3Ks are present in human and they are grouped in three classes ( I – III ) , depending on their sequence homology and substrate specificity . PI3Ks , generating a variety of phosphorylated phosphoinositides in different membrane compartments , are important regulators of endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking . In particular , hVPS34 , the unique member of class III PI3K responsible for the constitutive pool of PtdIns ( 3 ) P ( PI3P ) , is required for efficient binding and tethering functions of the FYVE - containing protein EEA1 in endosomal membranes ( for reviews , see Gillooly et al . , 2001 ; Overduin et al . , Fig . 3 . Silencing of PI3KC3 a reduces DT internalization and intoxication .

Wortmannin , a fungal metabolite that potently inhibits the activity of class I ( PI3K a and  ) and class III ( hVps34 ) but not class II PI3Ks ( and particularly PI3KC2 a ) ( Domin et al . , 1997 ) , neither prevented the internalization of DT – Cy3 ( Fig . 5A ) nor the intoxication of the cells , which died at the same rate and to the same extent as control cells ( data not shown ) , suggesting that hVPS34 , or other wortmannin - sensitive PI3Ks , do not play a role in the DT internalization pathway in HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells . Furthermore , in wortmannin - treated cells , DT - containing vesicles were still positive for EEA1 , indicating that EEA1 was still efficiently recruited to these endocytic structures ( Fig . 5A ) . Similar results were obtained using LY294002 , another PI3K inhibitor specific for the class I and III enzymes ( data not shown ) , suggesting that EEA1 recruitment to DT - labelled vesicles occurs independently of the classical PI3Ks . Wortmannin treatment , however , reduced the size of DT - vesicles ( Fig . 5A ) , suggesting a possible role for wortmannin - sensitive kinases in homo - and / or heterofusion of DT - vesicles . Of note , PI3KC2 a was the unique member of class II able to interfere with the DT internalization process . Downregulation of PI3KC2  had no effect on DT – Cy3 cellular entry ( Fig . 5B ) , and PI3KC2  is not expressed at detectable levels in HeLa cells ( data not shown ) . EEA1 recruitment to DT - endosomes requires PI3KC2 a and is necessary for DT internalization and / or trafficking Recent reports suggest that PI3KC2 a is the kinase responsible for the production of a dynamic pool of PI3P under stimulated 4244 Journal of Cell Science 123 ( 24 ) conditions in specific membranes ( Falasca and Maffucci , 2007 ; Wen et al . , 2008 ) . Because of the well - documented role for PI3P on EEA1 recruitment to endocytic membrane compartments ( Lindmo and Stenmark , 2006 ; Patki et al . , 1997 ) , we tested whether PI3KC2 a was responsible for the wortmannin - insensitive EEA1 recruitment to DT - vesicles . The EEA1 - positive compartment was analyzed by immunofluorescence in cells treated with sh - PI3KC2 a or a nonsilencing control and with unlabeled DT . Strikingly , downregulation of PI3KC2 a both in the presence and absence of wortmannin , resulted in a significant reduction of EEA1 recruitment to vesicles ( Fig . 6A , B ) . The small difference on EEA1 loading observed in the presence or absence of wortmannin also indicates that wortmannin - sensitive PI3Ks play a minimal role in EEA1 loading on DT - containing vesicles and further supports the finding that wortmannin does not affect DT internalization . To address directly the possible role for PI3KC2 a in the EEA1 recruitment to DT - vesicles internalized in a dynamin - independent manner ( Fig . 5A ) , we analyzed the level of EEA1 in PI3KC2 a - silenced cells that also expressed DynK44A . As shown in Fig . 6C , in cells coexpressing DynK44A and sh - PI3KC2 a , the number of EEA1 - positive structures was strongly decreased compared with the number in the nonsilencing control . This effect was specific for PI3KC2 a , as demonstrated by the fact that downregulation of PI3KC2  had no effect on EEA1 loading on endosomes ( supplementary material Fig . S5A , B ) . Together , these data suggest a specific role for PI3KC2 a in favouring EEA1 loading on vesicles derived from dynamin - independent pathways . Fig . 4 . PI3KC2 a silencing reduces CD59 internalization and fluid - phase endocytosis .

HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells were transfected with sh - PI3KC2 a or nonsilencing constructs . Antibodies against CD59 were internalized for 10 and 20 minutes at 37°C and the cells were processed for FACS analysis as described in the Materials and Methods section .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e To address whether EEA1 loss is the consequence of lacking the internalizing vesicles or whether EEA1 is required for their formation and trafficking , we functionally silenced the EEA1 protein . Transfection of the pGIPZ – EEA1 construct efficiently downregulated the EEA1 protein ( supplementary material Fig . S5C , D ) and resulted in a significant reduction of DT – Cy3 - positive vesicles in cells that overexpress DynK44A ( Fig . 6D ) , without reducing the total DT – Cy3 fluorescence ( supplementary material Fig . S5E ) measured after loading the DT – Cy3 at 4°C for 30 minutes in EEA1 - silenced cells . In agreement with other reports ( Huang et al . , 2004 ) , downregulation of EEA1 had no effect on the internalization of transferrin ( data not shown ) , suggesting a functional role for EEA1 specifically in dynamin - independent internalization processes . PI3KC2 a colocalizes with cargo proteins internalizing through dynamin - independent pathways To identify the site of action of PI3KC2 a during DT uptake , we analyzed its cellular localization during DT internalization . Similar to other cell lines ( Didichenko and Thelen , 2001 ; Domin et al . , 2000 ) , in HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells , PI3KC2 a was localized across the entire cell with a punctate staining ( Fig . 7 ) and no evident plasma membrane or endosomal enrichment . However , DT internalization led to a relocalization of PI3KC2 a from the cytoplasm to plasma membrane and vesicular compartments at the periphery of the cells . Furthermore , during DT – Cy3 internalization , PI3KC2 a showed a high degree of colocalization with internalized DT – Cy3 ( Fig . 7 ) . Relocalization of PI3KC2 a was also observed 4245 PI3KC2 a in dynamin - independent pathways in cells internalizing MHCI and GPI – GFP ( Fig . 7 ) , and PI3KC2 a colocalized with the internalizing proteins . Notably , transferrin internalization did not lead to any movement of PI3KC2 a across the cell . Furthermore , the internalized PI3KC2 a - positive structures generated by DT treatment were not enriched at other membrane proteins , such as the transferrin receptor ( supplementary material Fig . S6A ) , suggesting a role for PI3KC2 a specifically in dynamin - independent internalization pathways . DTR – GPI mediates DT internalization through Arf6 - and GRAF1 - dependent pathways As mentioned previously , two main pathways are known to act in dynamin - independent internalization : the GEEC pathway and the Arf6 - dependent pathway ( Kumari et al . , 2010 ) . In HeLa cells , the Arf6 pathway mediates internalization of MHCI and CD59 , whereas the GEEC pathway is reported to assist the uptake of cholera toxin , dextran and GPI – GFP . The observation that DT colocalizes with molecules that enter the cells using both pathways ( Fig . 2 ) suggests that the DTR – GPI can guide DT entry by multiple portals . To test this hypothesis , overexpression experiments with Arf6 and GRAF1 were used to interfere with the two pathways . Expression of constitutively active Arf6 ( Q67L ) , unable to hydrolyze GTP to GDP , is reported to impair the intracellular trafficking of the cargo molecules that remain trapped in Arf6 - positive vacuolar compartments ( Brown et al . , 2001 ) . When Arf6 ( Q67L ) was expressed in HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells , we observed DT – Cy3 accumulation in the typical Arf - 6 enlarged vesicles ( Fig . 8A ) , indicating that DT can use this internalization pathway . Similarly , overexpression experiments using a truncated form of GRAF1 ( BAR + PH domains ) , which is able to inhibit specifically the dynamics of the GEECs ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , resulted in the trapping of DT in the GEEC tubules stabilized and visualised by the BAR + PH – GFP construct , suggesting that DT can also enter through this pathway ( Fig . 8B ) . We concluded that , in our system , DT internalizes using both pathways , and , in agreement , we found that downregulation of Cdc42 , a key molecule for GEEC formation ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) but not required for the Arf6 pathway , resulted only in a partial decrease of DT – Cy3 internalization ( data not shown ) . Discussion In the past , the realization that several molecules , including GPI - APs and glycosphingolipids , can still be internalized when dynamin - dependent pathways are impaired has attracted much attention in the endocytic field ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Hansen and Nichols , 2009 ; Howes et al . , 2010 ; Kumari et al . , 2010 ; Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) . The abundance of lipid - linked molecules at the plasma membrane suggests that these ‘alternative’ portals could have important roles in physiological processes such as growth and differentiation , cell adhesion and regulation of signalling receptors . The most convincing evidence for the role for dynamin - independent pathways in physiological processes comes from in vivo analysis of model organisms . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , in which a single dynamin gene has been identified , the analysis of animals expressing mutant dynamin led to the understanding that other mechanisms must exist to substitute partially for dynamin activity in vital endocytic processes , such as the synaptic vesicle cycle ( Clark et al . , 1997 ) . Similar evidence was recently obtained from the analysis of dynamin I knockout mice ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , a number of toxins and viruses are reported to hijack these portals to enter specific cell Fig . 5 . DT – Cy3 internalization is unaffected by inhibition of other PI3Ks . ( A )  HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells were induced to express DynK44A and incubated with or without 100 nM wortmannin for 15 minutes at 37°C . DT – Cy3 was added for 30 minutes at 37°C in the presence or absence of wortmannin , and the cells were processed for detection of DynK44A and EEA1 . * , DynK44A - expressing cells . Red arrows point to vesicles positive for both DT – Cy3 and EEA1 . ( B )  HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI were transfected with sh - PI3KC2  or a nonsilencing control . After induction of DynK44A , DT – Cy3 was internalized for 30 minutes at 37°C , and the cells were processed for detection of DynK44A . Bars : 10  m m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e types , as in the case of HIV1 ( Vidricaire and Tremblay , 2007 ) , polyomavirus ( Gilbert and Benjamin , 2000 ) , VacA ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) , cholera toxin ( at least partially ) ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) , cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 ( CNF1 ) ( Contamin et al . , 2000 ) and ricin ( Simpson et al . , 1998 ) , indicating that these pathways could be relevant in pathogenic conditions . However , the mechanisms underlying these processes are still unclear , and very little information is available about the molecular components involved . With a novel cell - survival screening strategy using a library of shRNAs in a cell line in which DT internalizes in a dynamin - independent manner ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) , we identified several molecules , which , when reduced , inhibit the cellular uptake and / or trafficking of DT . We further validated PI3KC2 a as a key molecule for dynamin - independent pathways . Depletion of PI3KC2 a can efficiently inhibit DT internalization and cell intoxication in our system . Importantly , the internalizations of CD59 , known to traffic independently of dynamin in the cell , and dextran , a fluid - phase marker , are also impaired by PI3KC2 a silencing , reinforcing the role for PI3KC2 a in dynamin - independent internalization of physiological substrates . Furthermore , PI3KC2 a appears to be the unique PI3K involved in dynamin - independent internalization . DT internalization occurs in the presence of wortmannin , indicating that class I or III PI3Ks , which are sensitive to this drug , are not implicated in the internalization of DTR – GPI . This is in agreement with the previously published result for the folate receptor ( Kalia et al . , 2006 ) , another endogenous GPI - AP . Moreover , silencing of PI3KC2  , the other member of class II PI3Ks present in HeLa cells , does not have an effect on dynamin - independent internalization . A further indication that PI3KC2 a has a role in dynamin - independent internalization events is suggested by immunofluorescence analyses showing PI3KC2 a redistribution to 4246 Journal of Cell Science 123 ( 24 ) endomembranes during dynamin - independent internalization events . Similarly , PI3KC2 a is temporarily recruited to the plasma membrane and secretory vesicles after stimulation with insulin and Ca 2 + , respectively ( Falasca and Maffucci , 2007 ; Wen et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that recruitment of PI3KC2 a to specific membranes could be a common mechanism of activation leading to a local and temporary production of PI3P . The signal that dictates the relocalization of PI3KC2 a to specific endomembranes is not known at the moment , but the presence of a PX domain in the C - terminal part of the protein with high affinity for phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( Stahelin et al . , 2006 ) , abundant at the plasma membrane and in some internalizing vesicles , such as the Arf6 compartments ( Porat - Shliom et al . , 2008 ) , suggests that its intracellular localization could be mediated , at least in some conditions , by protein – lipid interactions . In recent years , two main distinct portals for dynamin - independent entry have been identified : the Arf6 - dependent pathway , which shares some characteristics and cargo with stimulated macropinocytosis ( Donaldson et al . , 2009 ) , involved in MHCI and CD59 ( in HeLa cells ) internalization , and the constitutive CLIC – GEEC pathway , specific for some GPI - APs and , at least in part , for fluid - phase internalization ( Kumari et al . , 2010 ) . The small GTPases Arf1 and Cdc42 , together with ARHGAP10 and GRAF1 , have been recognized as regulators of the dynamic tubular structures characteristic of this latter pathway ( Doherty and Lundmark , 2009 ; Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) . Fluorescence analyses indicate that DT colocalizes with markers of both pathways . DT is detected in Arf6 - vacuoles , arising from aberrant trafficking from the plasma membrane after transfection of the Arf6 mutant , and in the GEEC tubules , visualised by the GRAF1 – BAR + PH – GFP construct . These data suggest that the two pathways cooperate in DT internalization in our system and that Fig . 6 . EEA1 loading on endosomes depends partly on PI3KC2 a . ( A )  HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells were transfected with sh - PI3KC2 a or a nonsilencing control . The cells were treated with 100 nM wortmannin and unstained DT and processed for detection of EEA1 . Panels on the right - hand side show magnified images of the boxed areas . Note the diffuse EEA1 appearance in PI3KC2 a - depleted cells . ( B )  Quantification of EEA1 - positive compartments in cells transfected with sh - PI3KC2 a or a nonsilencing control and in the presence or absence of 100 nM wortmannin was performed as described in the Materials and Methods section . ( C )  sh - PI3KC2 a or nonsilencing transfected HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells were induced to express DynK44A and allowed to internalize unstained DT for 30 minutes at 37°C . The cells were processed for detection of DynK44A and EEA1 . Note the diffuse EEA1 staining in the outlined cell . Quantification of EEA1 - positive compartments was performed as described . ( D )  sh - EEA1 or nonsilencing - transfected HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells were induced to express DynK44A and allowed to internalize DT – Cy3 for 30 minutes at 37°C . The cells were processed for detection of DynK44A and examined by fluorescence microscopy . Histograms show the quantification of the internalized DT – Cy3 , performed as described in the Materials and Methods . The weighted mean fluorescence + s . e . m . values from at least three independent experiments are displayed . ( n > 150 cells ) . * P < 0 . 01 . Bars : 10  m m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e the DT , differentially from VacA toxin internalization that is specifically GEEC - mediated ( Gauthier et al . , 2007 ) , can also exploit the inducible Arf6 pathway . The fact that the silencing of PI3KC2 a efficiently prevented cell intoxication led us to hypothesize that PI3KC2 a could act in both pathways or in a step shared by the GEEC / Arf6 pathways . It is still unclear whether PI3KC2 a also acts in other dynamin - independent pathways , such as macropinocytosis , that could be stimulated by DT treatment . The fact that DT internalization is not prevented by wortmannin ( this study ) and staurosporine ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) , both inhibitors of macropinocytosis ( Araki et al . , 1996 ; Dharmawardhane et al . , 2000 ; Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ; Mercer et al . , 2010 ) , suggests that this is probably not the case . Moreover , DT treatment does not induce alteration in the CD59 internalization ( supplementary material Fig . S4B ) or nonspecific internalization of the transferrin receptor . These results suggest that the toxin does not trigger the prominent membrane reorganization and the nonselective internalization that is coupled with macropinocytosis . While other studies are required to determine the positioning of PI3KC2 a in the dynamin - independent pathways , our analysis suggests that PI3KC2 a function is regulated by EEA1 recruitment to vesicular compartments generated by dynamin - independent pathways . Downregulation of PI3KC2 a results in a strong reduction of EEA1 loading on endosomes in cells contemporaneously treated , or not , with wortmannin that inhibits the other PI3Ks or expressing DynK44A , which blocks clathrin - mediated endocytosis . As PI3KC2 a is recognized as the kinase responsible for the production 4247 PI3KC2 a in dynamin - independent pathways of a dynamic pool of PI3P under stimulated conditions , it is likely that its activity directly mediates EEA1 recruitment to specific membranes , a possibility that is reinforced by other studies reporting that vesicles derived from dynamin - independent pathways can acquire EEA1 independently of fusion with the classical endosomal compartments generated by clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Kalia et al . , 2006 ; Naslavsky et al . , 2003 ) . Our data suggest that EEA1 recruitment to the generating endomembranes plays a key function in dynamin - independent processes . The fact that silencing of EEA1 impairs DT internalization indicates that loss of EEA1 recruitment is not just a consequence of the lack of internalizing endosomes but , rather , suggests a functional role for EEA1 in DT internalization and / or trafficking . The identification in our original screen of p38  / MAPK11 ( C . K . , E . K . M . and A . E . S . , unpublished ) , a stress - response kinase known to phosphorylate and regulate EEA1 localization to endosomes ( Cavalli et al . , 2001 ; Mace et al . , 2005 ) , further reinforces our findings . An open question that remains to be addressed is whether EEA1 is the unique PI3P - binding molecule recruited to endosomes generated by dynamin - independent pathways . There is a possibility that other FYVE / PX - containing proteins with the ability to bind to PI3P , such as rabenosyn - 5 , Hrs or sorting nexins , could additionally be engaged in the process . However , initial experiments exclude a role for rabenosyn - 5 as its localization is unaffected in PI3KC2 a - silenced cells treated with wortmannin ( supplementary material Fig . S6B ) . The finding that EEA1 can interfere with DT internalization and / or trafficking could suggest an unexpected role for EEA1 at the plasma membrane . Further studies are required to test this hypothesis , which is indirectly supported by the fact that , after insulin treatment , PI3KC2 a has been identified at the plasma membrane , where it generates PI3P and promotes recruitment of the FYVE probe at this site ( Falasca and Maffucci , 2007 ) . However , the fact that downregulation of EEA1 results in a significant reduction of DT – Cy3 - positive vesicles in cells analyzed after 30 minutes of continuous uptake of DT might also indicate a role for EEA1 in later steps , for example in fusion of primary tubulovesicular carriers arising from the plasma membrane ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . Fig . 8 . DT – Cy3 is internalized both through the GRAF1 - and Arf6 - dependent pathways . HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells transfected with ( A ) Arf6Q67L or ( B ) GRAF1 – BAR + PH were allowed to internalize DT – Cy3 for 30 minutes at 37°C .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 4248 Journal of Cell Science 123 ( 24 ) Finally , there is an emerging role for PI3KC2 a as a general membrane trafficking regulator . Indeed , PI3KC2 a has been reported previously to interact with clathrin and to reduce the internalization of Tfn when overexpressed ( Gaidarov et al . , 2001 ; Gaidarov et al . , 2005 ) , an effect we did not observe under depletion conditions . Our analysis indicates that PI3KC2 a is involved in dynamin - independent endocytosis , acting both in the GEEC and the Arf6 pathway . It is possible that PI3KC2 a , similar to other proteins such as some GTPases , can exert key roles in different internalization pathways and , at the same time , regulates other vesicular trafficking processes , such as exocytosis in neurosecretory cells ( Wen et al . , 2008 ) . Further analyses using different cell types and other cargos that internalize in a dynamin - independent manner , together with the identification of specific inhibitors for class II PI3Ks , will help to understand fully the pleiotropic roles of PI3KC2 a . Materials and Methods Reagents All chemicals were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich unless otherwise specified . The mAb against EEA1 was purchased from BD Transduction laboratories . HA antibodies , used for the detection of HA - tagged DynK44A , were from Covance ( mAb ) and from Affinity BioReagents ( pAb ) .

DT and mutant DT - CRM197 ( Uchida et al . , 1972 ) were purchased from Calbiochem . Cy3 ( Amersham , GE Healthcare ) was conjugated to DT - CRM197 ( DT – Cy3 ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Decay - accelerating factor ( DAF ) fused to GFP ( GPI – GFP ) has been described previously ( Nichols et al . , 2001 ) ; GRAF1 and Arf6 constructs were kind gifts from Richard Lundmark ( University of Umeå , Sweden ) and Julie Donaldson ( NIH , USA ) , respectively . Cell culture , plasmids and transfection HeLa DynK44A and HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cell lines were cultured as described previously ( Lanzrein et al . , 1996 ; Llorente et al . , 1998 ; Skretting et al . , 1999 ) . DynK44A expression was induced by tetracycline removal for 36 – 48 hours . Approximately 80 % of HeLa DynK44A and 60 % of HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells expressed DynK44A . Transfections were performed using either calcium phosphate precipitation ( Graham and van der Eb , 1973 ) or LipofectAMINE 2000 ( Invitrogen ) reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions . shRNA constructs were expressed for 72 hours . GPI – GFP , pEGFP – GRAF1 – BAR + PH and pECFP – Arf6Q67L ( Addgene plasmid 11387 ) constructs were expressed for 16 hours before the analysis . pGIPZ – PI3KC2 a is lentiviral shRNAmir from Open Biosystems ( www . openbiosystems . com ) that allows the visualization of transfected and / or silenced cells by GFP expression . Wild - type PI3KC2 a was cloned into the Gateway - compatible pCMV - Myc vector ( generous gift from Jesper Christiansen , BRIC , University of Copenhagen ) using the Open Biosystems full - length cDNA ( clone ID 8322710 ) as a template . PI3KC2 a shRes was generated by site - direct mutagenesis ( Stratagene ) , introducing two silent mutations in the region of wild - type Myc - tagged PI3KC2 a recognized by the pGIPZ – PI3KC2 a silencing construct . shRNA screen and survival assay PI3KC2 a was identified as a hit in a screen using a library of shRNA , kindly provided by the NKI Institute , The Netherlands , targeting more than 8000 human genes ( a list of target genes is available at http : / / www . screeninc . nl ) ( Brummelkamp and Bernards , 2003 ) . Briefly , the screen was performed using pools of shRNAs targeting 1000 genes that were transfected into HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells . HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI or HeLa DynK44A cells transfected with the empty pRS vector were used as a negative control . Two days post - transfection , cells were plated in the absence of tetracycline for 48 hours and treated with 25 ng / ml DT for 4 hours and allowed to grow for two weeks . Genomic DNA was purified from surviving cells using a QiaAmp DNA Micro Kit ( Qiagen ) . Transfected constructs were amplified by PCR as described previously ( http : / / www . screeninc . nl ) and sequenced . A total of 63 positive hits were identified in the screen ( see supplementary material Table S1 ) . For the survival assay , silencing constructs were transfected individually into HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells and , two days post - transfection , the cells were plated in the absence of tetracycline for 48 hours and treated with 25 ng / ml DT for 1 hour and allowed to grow for approximately 10 days . Cells were fixed in 4 % PFA and stained with crystal violet for 5 minutes at room temperature . Cells were dissolved in 10 % acetic acid , and absorbance was measured in triplicate at 620 nm . Survival assays were performed at least three times for each construct . Empty pRS constructs and nonsilencing shRNA constructs were used as negative controls , respectively . Internalization assays and immunofluorescence For internalization assays , cells were incubated with DT – Cy3 ( ~ 5 m g / ml ) for the indicated times at 37°C . Tfn Alexa Fluor 488 or Tfn Texas Red conjugates ( 50 m g / ml ) and CtxB Alexa Fluor 488 conjugates ( 1 m g / ml ) were added to the cells for 5 or 10 minutes at 37°C . For the CD59 , MHCI and GPI – GFP colocalization analysis with DT – Cy3 , the corresponding antibody was added to the cells for 10 minutes together with DT – Cy3 at 37°C , and cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described below . For the PI3KC2 a relocalization studies , DT – Cy3 ( ~ 5 m g / ml ) , CD59 ( 5 m g / ml ) and MHC I ( 4 m g / ml ) antibodies were added to the cells for 20 minutes at 37°C . Tfn Alexa Fluor 488 was internalized for 5 minutes at 37°C . The cells were processed further for immunofluorescence as described below . Cells were fixed in 4 % PFA ( BDH ProLABO ) and permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS at room temperature . In some experiments ( e . g . GRAF1 – BAR + PH expression ) , cell fixation was performed at 37°C ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Cells were blocked in cell culture medium for 30 minutes , and primary antibodies were added in blocking solution for 2 hours at room temperature or at 4°C overnight . For wortmannin treatment , cells were preincubated for 15 minutes at 37°C with 100 nM wortmannin or with the carrier ( 0 . 01 % DMSO ) . DT – Cy3 or unstained DT was added for 30 minutes at 37°C with or without 100 nM wortmannin . For the analysis of fluid - phase internalization , transfected HeLa cells were incubated with Dextran – Alexa Fluor 594 ( 10 MW ) for 20 minutes at 37°C and either fixed and processed for fluorescence or lysed in 1 % Nonidet P - 40 lysis buffer ( Nonidet P - 40 , 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 20 mM NaMoO 4 containing a protease inhibitor cocktail ) . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C and the protein concentration measured for normalization . The amount of Dextran Alexa Fluor 594 in the supernatant was measured from the emission at 612 nm after exciting at 584 nm using a FLUOstar OPTIMA . Upon exposure to low pH , DT translocates unspecifically to the cytosol ( data not shown ) ( Skretting et al . , 1999 ) , and acid washes to remove DT bound to the plasma membrane were therefore not possible . Furthermore , loading at 4°C was not performed ( all time - points are therefore a measure of continuous uptake after DT addition to the culture medium ) as this prevented uptake of DT . This might be related to the fact that dynamin - independent pathways are reported to be sensitive to low temperatures ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Imaging , image processing and quantification Fluorescence micrographs were acquired using an Axiovert 135 ( Carl Zeiss ) with a (cid:3) 63 ( NA 1 . 4 ) Plan Apochrome objective in immersion oil , at room temperature with a CoolSNAP cf2 Photometrics camera using MetaMorph software ( MDS Analytical Technologies ) . Confocal images were acquired using an Axiovert 200M LSM 510 ( Carl Zeiss ) using a (cid:3) 63 ( NA 1 . 2 ) c - Apochromat objective in dH 2 O at room temperature using LSM 510 META software and LSM image examiner software ( Carl Zeiss ) . Images were exported in preparation for printing using Photoshop ( Adobe ) . The mean and s . e . m . of integrated intensities per cell from each coverslip were determined using Metamorph software . At least 40 cells in each condition were analyzed in two or three independent experiments . Quantification of internalized DT – Cy3 was achieved using images of cells coexpressing DynK44A and different silencing constructs ( or the nonsilencing control ) treated with DT – Cy3 for 30 minutes at 37°C . To ensure that the decrease in internalized DT – Cy3 was not due to a reduced binding at the plasma membrane , the total fluorescence was quantified in cells loaded with DT – Cy3 for 30 minutes on ice . Quantitative analysis of the EEA1 - positive compartments was performed comparing the total fluorescence of nonsilenced cells versus sh - PI3KC2 a - transfected cells , and the images were processed for background correction using Metamorph software , such that all the endosomes with intensity above the background were identified . Protein synthesis assay and mRNA analysis by RT - qPCR Protein synthesis was measured using [ 35 S ] methionine , as described previously ( Llorente et al . , 1998 ) . Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Minikit ( Qiagen ) . Quantitative PCR was performed as described previously ( Rose et al . , 2007 ) . Oligonucleotides used for RT - qPCR are available upon request . FACS The degree of internalization of CD59 was analyzed using a fluorescence - activated cell sorter ( FACS ) assay . HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells transfected with the pGIPZ – PI3KC2 a or nonsilencing shRNA constructs were incubated with the CD59 antibody ( 5 m g / ml ) for 10 and 20 minutes at 37°C . The cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 4 % PFA for 10 minutes . The cells were then stained with anti - mouse Alexa Flour 594 for 1 hour and analyzed on a FACS Calibur ( BD Biosciences ) using CellQuestsoftware ( Becton Dickinson ) . Total CD59 staining ( internalized and plasma membrane CD59 ) was measured in permeabilized cells ( 0 . 1 % saponin in 1 . 5 % FBS J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 4249 PI3KC2 a in dynamin - independent pathways heat inactivated in PBS for 1 hour at 4°C ) and plasma membrane CD59 staining was measured in nonpermeabilized cells . Quantifications of the mean fluorescence in GFP - positive cells were performed using Modfit LT software ( Verity Software House ) . The percentage of internalization was calculated as described previously ( Janvier and Bonifacino , 2005 ) . Steady - state surface levels of CD59 , determined by loading CD59 antibodies on ice before fixation , indicated that the plasma membrane level of CD59 is unchanged after PI3KC2 a silencing ( supplementary material Fig . S4 ) . Permeabilization of the cells had no detectable effect on the levels of CD59 at the plasma membrane at steady state ( data not shown ) . In the rescue experiment , pGIPZ – PI3KC2 a and PI3KC2 a shRes were co - transfected in HeLa DynK44A DTR – GPI cells that were analyzed for CD59 internalization . The data reported have been normalized to nonsilencing controls . Statistical analysis The results are expressed as means + s . e . m . Statistical significance was determined using unpaired , two - tail distribution , t - tests . Data indicated with an asterisk have values of * P < 0 . 01 .
