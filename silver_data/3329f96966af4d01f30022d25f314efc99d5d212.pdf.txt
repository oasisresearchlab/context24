Joines 1 Business Cycles Module Objectives • Know the causes of business cycles • Know how interest rates are determined • Know how various economic indicatorsbehave over the business cycle • Understand the benefits and limitations ofcountercyclical fiscal policies What Are Business Cycles ? • Business cycles are short - run deviations of the economy from its long - run trend • Cycles are irregular rather than fixed in duration – Typically , a complete cycle lasts 5 to 7 years – The expansion phase of the cycle typically lastslonger than the contraction phase ( c ) Copyright 1999 by Douglas H . Joines 2 Cyclical Behavior of Indicators • Many macroeconomic indicators exhibitcyclical behavior – Procyclical variables move up during the expansion phase of the cycle and down duringthe contraction phase – Countercyclical variables move down during the expansion phase of the cycle and up duringthe contraction phase What Causes Cycles ? Y t = A t K t a L t 1 - a • Assess the importance of short - runmovements of L , K , and A .

Simple Keynesian Model • Consumption function – marginal propensity to consume ( MPC ) • Multiplier – depends on MPC • Recessions could be caused by deficient aggregate demand • Suggests countercyclical fiscal policy – tax cut – spending increase ( c ) Copyright 1999 by Douglas H . Joines 4 Permanent Income Hypothesis • Consumption depends on – permanent income • current income • future income – interest rate – age ( in Life - Cycle Hypothesis ) Implications • Marginal Propensity to Consume – is not well defined – is close to one for permanent changes in income – is close to zero for transitory changes in income – increases with age ( in Life - Cycle Hypothesis ) Capital and Investment • K is an input in the production function • Investment is a component of aggregate demand • K t + 1 = K t + I t - d K t • Net Investment = I t - d K t • Net Investment is about 2 - 3 % of K – Large fluctuations in net investment cause onlysmall changes in K – K is very smooth ( c ) Copyright 1999 by Douglas H . Joines 5 Investment Demand • Net marginal rate of return on capital MPK t + 1 - d • Market rate of interest is r • Compare the two returns • Investment demand depends on expecations about the future MPK Investment Demand Curve MPK t + 1 r I MPK t + 1 - d I 0 r 0 d Shifts in Investment Demand MPK = a A ( K / L ) a - 1 • Changes in capital - labor ratio – cross - country comparisons – ongoing population growth – baby boom • Technology shocks – ongoing technological improvement – temporary productivity shocks ( c ) Copyright 1999 by Douglas H .

Joines 7 Future Productivity Shock Closed Economy S I 0 r r 0 S , I I 0 I 1 I 1 r 1 Stock Prices and Interest Rates • Leftward shift of saving curve – higher interest rates ( lower bond prices ) – constant or lower profits – lower stock prices • Rightward shift of investment curve – higher interest rates ( lower bond prices ) – higher profits – probably higher stock prices Countercyclical Fiscal Policies • Temporary tax cuts – raise private disposable income – how much does private consumption increase ? • Temporary government spending ( c ) Copyright 1999 by Douglas H . Joines 8 Difficulties with Countercyclical Government Purchases • Lags – inside lag • recognition • implementation – outside lag • Forecasting • Ignorance of parameters ( e . g . , MPC ) • Changing parameters – expectations Civilian Working - Age Population Unemployed 6 . 68 Employed 129 . 80 Not in Labor Force 66 . 88 August 1997 Labor Market Puzzles • Why would we ever observe unemployment ? – Is it equivalent to excess supply of labor ? – Why doesn’t wage rate adjust ? • Why do we simultaneously observe unemployment and job vacancies ? ( c ) Copyright 1999 by Douglas H . Joines 9 Frictions in the Labor Market • Heterogeneity of workers and jobs – Workers differ in skills – Jobs also differ – There is a gain from appropriately matchingworkers and jobs • Imperfect information – Prevents instantaneous matching – Leads to job search Model of Labor Turnover • A substantial amount of turnover in thelabor force is normal • Notation : – s is job separation rate – f is job finding rate – E is total employment – U is total unemployment – LF is labor force , and LF = E + U Natural Rate of Unemployment • The unemployment rate is u = U / LF • The change in total employment D E = fU - sE • If D E = 0 , then u = s / ( s + f ) • The natural rate of unemployment occurs when D E = 0 and s and f are at their “normal” levels ( c ) Copyright 1999 by Douglas H . Joines 10 Long - Term Effects on the Natural Rate of Unemployment • Demographic changes – young workers – female workers – ethnic differences • Government policy – unemployment benefits – minimum wage – restrictions on firing workers • Speed of economic change Cyclical Unemployment • Recessions temporarily raise the jobseparation rate , s , and lower the job finding rate , f – Countercyclical unemployment rate • Unemployment rate is a lagging indicator – f returns to normal only after output begins growing – Unemployment remains above the natural rateeven after s and f return to normal Total Unemployment Rate 2 4 6 8 10 12 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 ( c ) Copyright 1999 by Douglas H .
