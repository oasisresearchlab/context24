We have developed a novel system that utilizes the capacities of generative AI to transform intricate principles in mathematics , physics , and programming into comprehensible metaphors . To further augment the educational experience , these metaphors are subsequently converted into visual form . Our study aims to enhance the learners’ un - derstanding of STEM concepts and their learning engagement by using the visual metaphors . We ex - amine the efficacy of our system via a randomized A / B / C test , assessing learning gains and motivation shifts among the learners . Our study demonstrates the potential of applying large language models to educational practice on STEM subjects . The results will shed light on the design of educational system in terms of harnessing AI’s potential to empower educational stakeholders . 1 Introduction The teaching and learning of science , technology , engineer - ing , and mathematics ( STEM ) stand as an essential yet chal - lenging aspect of education . Concepts , the bedrock of STEM , are frequently abstract and complex , demanding learners to exhibit higher - order thinking skills such as logical reasoning and problem - solving . Consequently , comprehending these al - gorithms often poses significant hurdles for learners , particu - larly for those new to the field [ Lee and Ko ( 2011 ) ] . Current pedagogical practices primarily rely on textual explanations and code examples to convey these concepts , which , although useful , can be limiting . Traditional methods might fail to demystify abstract concepts adequately , relying heavily on learners’ abilities to translate theoretical knowl - edge into functional understanding [ Kolikant ( 2010 ) ] . More - over , the inherently linear nature of text - based teaching meth - ods may not cater well to the non - linear and dynamic nature of STEM concepts [ Sorva et al . ( 2013 ) ] . Educators , particularly in the STEM fields , face their own set of challenges . Lesson planning , particularly for complex topics like mathematical theorems , physical laws , and com - putational algorithms , can be a daunting task , demanding not just extensive subject knowledge , but also creativity in craft - ing engaging content [ Xu and Ouyang ( 2022 ) ] . Resource con - straints , such as limited time and funding , further add to these challenges . Technological limitations also come into play , as the tools to create interactive , multimodal learning content are often expensive or difficult to use [ Lee et al . ( 2014 ) ] . Recognizing these challenges , this paper introduces an in - novative , AI - driven , multimodal approach to teaching STEM algorithms . The proposed approach harnesses the capabil - ities of a state - of - the - art large language model , to generate intuitive analogies and transform them into engaging visual storyboards with a text - to - image generative model . The aim is to enhance pedagogical efficiency and , most importantly , to improve learners’ comprehension of complex STEM algo - rithms . 2 Related Work 2 . 1 AI for Analogical Reasoning Analogical reasoning , a cognitive process that involves trans - ferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain based on similarities and differences , has long been recog - nized as a powerful tool for problem - solving and learning [ Gentner and Markman ( 1997 ) ; Holyoak and Thagard ( 1996 ) ] . Analogies can help learners make connections between fa - miliar and unfamiliar concepts , facilitating understanding and promoting knowledge transfer [ Richland et al . ( 2007 ) ] . Re - cent advancements in AI , particularly the development of large language models like GPT - 4 , have unlocked new pos - sibilities for generating analogies and facilitating their inte - a r X i v : 2308 . 10454v1 [ c s . A I ] 21 A ug 2023 gration into educational contexts . Previous research suggests that Large Language Models ( LLMs ) might have the ability to create analogies that are similar to those made by humans , including longer natural - language analogies [ Team ( 2020 ) ] , explain analogical mappings [ Webb et al . ( 2022 ) ; Bhavya et al . ( 2022 ) ] , or invent analogy - inspired concepts for cre - ative problem - solving [ Zhu and Luo ( 2022 ) ; Zhu et al . ( 2023 ) ; Webb et al . ( 2022 ) ; Ding et al . ( 2023 ) ; Ding and Chan ( 2023 ) ] . 2 . 2 Analogical Reasoning to Support Education Previous work highlighted how AI can generate personalized learning pathways for students , leading to enhanced learning outcomes [ Tetzlaff et al . ( 2021 ) ] , and underscored the poten - tial of AI in predicting and improving student engagement and performance [ Maghsudi et al . ( 2021 ) ] . One strength of AI is the ability to simplify complex con - cepts . For STEM topics , it can generate relevant analogies or stories that draw on more familiar situations or narratives . For example , variables in STEM can be thought of as boxes where you store things ( values ) , which you label so you know what’s inside [ Tetzlaff et al . ( 2021 ) ] . Additionally , for visual learners , storyboards or visual analogies can be created to help explain these concepts . Adaptive storytelling refers to tailoring the narrative based on the individual’s understanding or prefer - ence for learning , which can be gauged through their inter - actions or explicit feedback [ Bietti et al . ( 2019 ) ] . This ability can be employed to generate study materials , simplifying ed - ucators’ workload and enhancing the learning experience . 2 . 3 STEM Education Learning to program is increasingly recognized as a critical skill . However , acquiring this skill can be a daunting task due to the complexity and abstractness of STEM algorithms [ Selby ( 2015 ) ; Mar ´ ın et al . ( 2018 ) ] . Despite numerous ped - agogical strategies—like pair STEM , code tracing , and the use of visual aids—many students still find it challenging to comprehend and apply algorithmic concepts [ Kalelioglu and G¨ulbahar ( 2014 ) ] . A common pedagogical strategy for teaching algo - rithms is through textual explanations and examples [ Lopez et al . ( 2008 ) ] . However , this approach can be insufficient , par - ticularly for novices , as it requires the learner to translate the abstract , textual information into a more concrete understand - ing [ Kolikant ( 2010 ) ] . This translation process is often fraught with challenges and can result in misconceptions . 2 . 4 Multimodal Learning and Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Given the challenges of textual explanations , researchers have begun exploring multimodal learning approaches , which combine text with other modalities , such as images or videos . Mayer’s [ Mayer ( 2002 ) ] cognitive theory of multimedia learn - ing posits that people learn better from words and pictures together than from words alone . His research has sparked a growing interest in multimodal learning in various fields , in - cluding computer science education [ B´etrancourt ( 2005 ) ] . Aligned with Mayer’s theory , Paivio’s [ Paivio ( 1991 ) ] dual coding theory proposes that verbal and non - verbal systems are used for cognitive processing . He suggests that informa - tion can be remembered better if it is presented in both ver - bal and visual formats . This theory has been used to inform many multimodal learning approaches , which attempt to ex - ploit both the visual and verbal cognitive subsystems . 2 . 5 Synthesis and Research Gap The reviewed literature shows the potential of AI in education and the need for innovative approaches to teaching STEM al - gorithms . There is also theoretical support for using multi - modal approaches to enhance learning . However , there is a clear gap in research that combines these elements—AI , multi - modal learning , and STEM education . This study aims to fill this gap by exploring an AI - driven , multi - modal ap - proach to teaching STEM algorithms . In this paper , we present an innovative approach that har - nesses the power of analogical reasoning , multimodal learn - ing , and AI technologies to demystify STEM concepts . By combining AI - generated analogies with visual storyboards and animated videos , we aim to enhance learners’ compre - hension and knowledge retention in the field of STEM . We believe that this multimodal approach has the potential to revolutionize STEM education , inspire creative instructional content creation , and shed light on the interplay between ana - logical reasoning , abstraction , and cognitive processes . This innovative educational approach sits at the intersec - tion of AI and education , an increasingly researched area that holds immense potential . Leveraging AI to aid teaching and learning can provide personalized learning experiences , mak - ing education more effective and engaging . Therefore , an ex - ploration into the role of AI , especially in generating analo - gies and visual aids , contributes valuable insights into this burgeoning field . In addition to its theoretical implications , this research has practical significance . If successful , our approach could be a valuable tool for educators , aiding them in planning engaging lessons and providing students with a unique , effective way to understand abstract STEM concepts . In the long run , it could significantly transform teaching and learning processes in computer science and beyond . The potential of AI in education has been well - documented , with significant strides in personalized learning and content generation . However , the application of AI for generating intuitive analogies and visual aids in STEM edu - cation is an under - explored domain . Our approach aims to fill this gap , exploiting the power of AI to create an engaging learning experience . 3 Theoretical Framework This study is underpinned by three major theoretical per - spectives : Mayer’s cognitive theory of multimedia learning , Paivio’s dual coding theory , and Piaget’s theory of cognitive development . Mayer [ Mayer ( 2002 ) ] and Paivio [ Paivio ( 1991 ) ] provide the rationale for employing a multimodal approach , suggest - ing that learners process information more effectively when presented using both verbal and visual means . Piaget’s theory of cognitive development [ Piaget ( 1970 ) ] further supports our approach . Piaget postulates that knowledge acquisition is an active , constructive process where learners constantly build and adjust their understanding by integrating new informa - tion with their existing knowledge base . This theory justifies our approach’s interactive nature , which prompts learners to actively engage with the content , facilitating the integration of new information . Our methodology is also heavily informed by best prac - tices in UX / UI design . Following Norman’s principles [ Nor - man ( 1988 ) ] , the interface is designed to be simple and in - tuitive , minimizing the cognitive load on the users . Clear instructions and feedback mechanisms are incorporated to guide the users through the process of selecting an analogy , generating a storyboard , and creating the animated video . The design also allows flexibility for the users to edit the gen - erated content , providing a sense of control and customiza - tion , which further enhances the user experience . These theories collectively inform the design of our AI - driven , multimodal learning solution that leverages analo - gies and visual storyboards . We hypothesize that this ap - proach can enhance the comprehension of complex STEM algorithms by stimulating multiple cognitive subsystems and fostering an active learning environment . 4 Methodology We developed a prototype with live deployment 1 . The proto - type is backed by GPT - 4 , one of the most advanced language models developed by OpenAI ( in Jul 2023 ) , to generate a set of analogies based on specific STEM concepts . Users can provide a STEM concept ( e . g . , “Newton’s first Law” ) as in - put , and the GPT - 4 model generates three distinct analogies ( e . g . , skating on ice , pushing a stalled car , and the stationary soccer ball ) as shown in the Appendix A . These analogies are designed to be intuitive and engaging , catering to a range of learner preferences . Following the analogy selection , the system uses preset prompts to create a narrative based on the chosen analogy . This narrative serves as the foundation for generating a story - board . The storyboard comprises a sequence of four images and each iamge is accompanied by a description , which pro - vides a step - by - step visualization of the STEM concept using the selected analogy . Finally , the images and descriptions from the storyboard are transformed into an animated video . The video serves as an engaging and easily digestible medium to convey the STEM concept building upon the principles of multimedia learning and dual coding theories . 5 Preliminary Results We examined the content generation performance of our tool through a sequence of incremental steps , each substantiated by specific cases . These steps include : • Transforming STEM concepts into text - based analogies . • Converting text - based analogies into static visual analo - gies . 1 https : / / analogen . netlify . app / • Evolving static visual analogies into dynamic visual analogies . In the initial phase , our trials revealed that our tool was pro - ficient in generating informative text - based analogies from STEM concepts . For instance , in the context of Object - Oriented Programming ( OOP ) , objects were analogized as Lego bricks , and classes were likened to structures of Lego . In the second phase , our tool was capable of producing visually appealing images for text - based analogies . How - ever , we encountered a challenge in that STEM concepts of - ten encompass multiple components that must be depicted in an analogy . This complexity is evident in analogies for OOP ( objects , classes ) and the analogy between water pres - sure / current and electric voltage / current in physics . Despite our emphasis on differentiating these components in the im - age generation prompts , the generative model frequently fell short in representing each part comprehensively . For exam - ple , consider the prompt for generating the analogy between water pressure / current and electric voltage / current : ”Water flows through a narrow tube connected be - tween two water tanks , one tank having signifi - cantly more water than the other . ” Figure 1 : Visual analogy for water pressure / current and electric volt - age / current with prompt ”Water flows through a narrow tube con - nected between two water tanks , one tank having significantly more water than the other . ” Only the image in the top right corner ( the sec - ond one ) displayed two water tanks , with one tank ( right ) containing more water than the other . However , it was missing a connecting tube , an important feature needed to symbolize the relationship be - tween water current and electric current . From the generated images as shown in Figure 1 , only the second one ( in the top right corner ) featured two water tanks , with one having more water than the other , but it lacked a connecting tube , a critical element to represent the mapping between water current and electric current . In the third phase , the creation of dynamic visual analogies , while visually appealing , posed challenges in devising suit - able transitions or motions to articulate the analogy dynami - cally . Taking the analogy between water pressure / current and electric voltage / current as an example , we found it difficult to generate a visual representation that effectively conveyed the concept of ”water flowing from the tank with more water to the tank with less water . ” 6 Discussion While the preliminary results indicate promising outcomes in terms of content generation and potential educational effec - tiveness , it is essential to recognize the need of an empirical study with learner participants in a real - world setting . Our next step is to conduct a between - subject study with different types of analogies to gain valuable insights into the actual learning outcomes , learner engagement , and potential areas for improvement . Additionally , expanding the study to different STEM concepts and considering diverse learner pro - files could help assess the generalizability and effectiveness of the approach in various educational settings . 7 Conclusion This paper introduces a generative - AI - facilitated pedagogi - cal tool for computer science education . Our results reveal the potential of expanding this multimodal approach to other subjects ( e . g . , physics , chemistry , and mathematics ) in future research . By revolutionizing the creation of educational con - tent , we aim to break down the barriers to understanding com - plex leanring concepts and foster an environment conducive to both teaching and learning .
