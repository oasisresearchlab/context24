Endocytosis has been reported as a major pathway for the cellular uptake of exosomes ; however , the detailed mechanisms of their cellular uptake are still unknown . Here , we demonstrate the active induction of macropinocytosis ( accompanied by actin reorganisation , ruffling of plasma membrane , and engulfment of large volumes of extracellular fluid ) by stimulation of cancer - related receptors and show that the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor significantly enhances the cellular uptake of exosomes . We also demonstrate that oncogenic K - Ras - expressing MIA PaCa - 2 cells exhibit intensive macropinocytosis that actively transports extracellular exosomes into the cells compared with wild - type K - Ras - expressing BxPC - 3 cells . Furthermore , encapsulation of the ribosome - inactivating protein saporin with EGF in exosomes using our simple electroporation method produces superior cytotoxicity via the enhanced cellular uptake of exosomes . Our findings contribute to the biological , pharmaceutical , and medical research fields in terms of understanding the macropinocytosis - mediated cellular uptake of exosomes with applications for exosomal delivery systems . In cell - to - cell communication , exosomes have received significant attention as an important carrier of bioactive molecules , including membrane receptors , proteins , and microRNA ; they are capable of manip - ulating cell functions not only for the maintenance of biological homeostasis but also in relation to diseases 1 . Exosomes are ~ 100 - nm vesicles that consist of a lipid bilayer of cellular membranes generated from multivesicular bodies in cells 1 , and they are secreted in large quantities ( there are approximately 3 , 000 , 000 exosomes / μ l in the blood 2 ) from various types of normal and disease - related cells . Exosomes can contain lipids ( sphingomyelin , cholesterol , ceramide ) , membrane proteins ( Alix , TSG 101 ) , tetraspanins ( CD63 , CD37 , CD53 , CD81 , CD82 ) , heat - shock proteins ( Hsp84 / 90 , Hsc70 ) , antigens ( MHC I and MHC 1 Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Research Center , Research Organization for the 21st Century , Osaka Prefecture University , Naka - ku , Sakai , Osaka 599 - 8570 , Japan . 2 Keio Advanced Research Centers ( KARC ) , Keio University , Tsukuba , Ibaraki 300 - 2611 , Japan . 3 Institute for Advanced Sciences , Toagosei Co . , Ltd . , Tsukuba , Ibaraki 300 - 2611 , Japan . 4 Department of Pharmaceutics , School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences , Mukogawa Women’s University , 11 - 68 , Koshien Kyuban - cho , Nishinomiya , Hyogo 663 - 8179 , Japan .

In a current immunotherapy trial , the possibility of exosome - based cancer vaccines ( e . g . , exosomes bearing tumour antigens to recognise and destroy cancer cells ) has been exploited 4 – 8 . Oncogenic microRNAs can also be delivered by exosomes during cancer invasion and metastasis 9 – 11 . In addition , the encapsulation of specific types of microRNAs in exosomes , which are secreted from disease - related cells ( especially from tumours ) , has also been reported [ e . g . , miR - 1246 ( oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma ) and miR - 1229 ( colon cancer ) ] . The detection of exosomal microRNA from human bodily fluids , including blood , breast milk , saliva , urine , placenta , amniotic fluid , and nasal fluid , is being intensively investi - gated for next - generation diagnosis technology for detecting silent human diseases with a low patient burden 3 , 12 , 13 . In addition , exosomes have been studied as delivery carriers of genes for cellular regulation and therapeutics 1 , 14 – 17 . For example , exosomes have been applied to knockdown BACE1 as a therapeu - tic target of Alzheimer’s disease 18 . Exosomes are highly anticipated to be next - generation therapeutic carriers with certain pharmaceutical advantages , including non - immunogenicity , constitutive secretion from cells , very low cytotoxicity , original and artificial encapsulation of bioactive molecules ( especially microRNAs ) , and the protein engineering of the exosomal membrane 19 . However , exosome - mediated delivery systems should be further developed , especially in terms of their low efficiency of cellular uptake with competition among a markedly high number of pre - existing natural exosomes in human fluids , as described above . Endocytosis has been reported to be a major pathway for the cellular uptake of exosomes , and exo - somal membrane proteins ( e . g . , CD9 , CD81 ) have been reported to be ligands for their endocytosis pathways 20 – 23 . However , the detailed mechanisms of their cellular uptake are still unknown . Further elucidation of the complicated mechanisms involved is urgently required to understand exosome - based cell - to - cell communications from the standpoint of cellular uptake control and for the development of intracellular delivery systems of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules based on exosomal internalisation mechanisms . In our novel findings related to exosome cellular uptake mechanisms , we here demonstrate the active induction of macropinocytosis ( accompanied by actin reorganisation , ruffling of the plasma membrane , and engulfment of large volumes of extracellular fluid 24 , 25 ) by stimulation of cancer - related receptors , including the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , which significantly enhances the cellular uptake of exosomes ( Fig . 1 ) . Especially after EGFR stimulation by treatment with the receptor ligand epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , the cellular uptake of exosomes was enhanced approximately 27 - fold in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells that express high levels of EGFR on the plasma membrane ( with expression of over 10 6 receptors / cell ) 26 . MIA PaCa - 2 cells ( human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells ) , which are homozygous for the K - Ras G12C allele , have been reported to exhibit high levels of macropinocytosis for the transport of extracellular proteins into the cells as an important route of nutrient uptake compared with BxPC - 3 cells , which express wild - type K - Ras 27 – 29 . Our experimental results showed a highly supe - rior cellular uptake of exosomes by MIA PaCa - 2 cells compared with that of BxPC - 3 cells , suggesting the possible relevance of cell - to - cell communication based on exosomes in oncogenic Ras - mediated macropi - nocytosis and malignant progression . The ribosome - inactivating protein saporin - encapsulated exosomes also showed enhanced cytotoxicity by the addition of EGF for the induction of macropinocytosis . In addition , we here demonstrate that the electroporation of exosomes for the artificial encapsulation of Figure 1 .

Results Activation of the macropinocytosis pathway by EGFR stimulation enhances the cellular uptake of exosomes . Endocytosis has been shown to be a major pathway for the cellular uptake of exosomes , as described above 20 – 23 . However , the endocytosis pathway has a cargo size limitation ( ~ 120 nm ) for cel - lular uptake 30 . Exosomes are approximately 100 - nm vesicles , and the endocytosis pathway exhibits low efficacy for the cellular uptake of exosomes because of the size limitation . The macropinocytosis pathway involves the engulfment of large volumes of extracellular fluid , and this pathway achieves cellular uptake of large cargo sizes ( ~ 1 μ m ) 24 , 25 , 30 . In this study , we investigated the effects of macropinocytosis induction on the cellular uptake efficiency of exosomes . EGFR , which is a representative tyrosine kinase receptor , regulates signal transduction pathways for proliferation , motility , and survival 31 – 33 . EGFR expression has been observed in a variety of human tumours , such as those in the lung , head and neck , pancreas , ovary , and glioma , and high expression of the receptor has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with tumours 34 . EGFR stimulation by treatment with the receptor ligands , including EGF , induces signal transduction pathways for macropinocytotic cellular uptake via the activation of Rac , a member of the Rho family of small GTPases , which leads to actin cytoskeletal organisation containing Figure 2 . Stimulation of EGFR by treatment with EGF enhances cellular uptake of exosomes via the macropinocytosis pathway .

The effects of EGFR stimulation on the cellular uptake of exosomes were examined first and are shown in Fig . 2 . A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells highly express EGFR on the plasma membrane 26 , and EGF effectively induces receptor activation ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) and signalling for macropinocytotic cellular uptake . Lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling for mac - ropinocytotic cellular uptake is induced by EGF treatment in A431 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 2b - d ) . In this research , green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - fused CD63 - expressing exosomes ( CD63 - GFP - exosomes ) were used for the detection of their cellular uptake . Tetraspanin CD63 protein is a marker protein of exo - somal membranes 1 , and GFP - fused CD63 stably expressing HeLa cells ( CD63 - GFP - HeLa ) were prepared ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . The CD63 - GFP exosomes secreted from CD63 - GFP HeLa cells were isolated as described in the Methods section . Isolated exosomes were observed using transmission electron micros - copy ( TEM ; Supplementary Fig . 1b ) , and the expression of the exosomal marker protein CD63 in isolated exosomes was detected using western blot analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Figure 2a shows the confocal microscopic results of A431 cells treated with CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) in the presence or absence of EGF ( 500 nM ) for 24 h at 37 °C in serum - free cell culture medium . In the absence of EGF , internalised CD63 - GFP exosomes were difficult to observe because of the very low cellular uptake efficacy of the exosomes in this experimental condition ( Fig . 2a ) . Negatively charged exosomal membranes 37 – 39 are thought to repel negatively charged cellular membranes , resulting in a low cellular uptake efficiency of these exosomes . The zeta potential of isolated exosomes in this experiment was − 11 . 6 mV , as analysed using a zeta potential analyser , which was a value similar to pre - viously reported results 37 – 39 . On the other hand , the addition of the EGF significantly affected the cellular uptake efficiency of the exosomes , and increased fluorescent signals of CD63 - GFP - exosomes taken up by the cells were observed using a confocal microscope ( Fig . 2a ) . Under the same experimental conditions as with the confocal microscopy observations , the fluorescence intensity of the CD63 - GFP - exosomes inside the cells was detected using a flow cytometer as described in Methods section ( Fig . 2b ) . The analysis showed enhanced cellular uptake efficiency of the exosomes through the addition of EGF ( e . g . , approximately 27 - fold enhanced cellular uptake by the addition of 500 nM EGF ; Fig . 2b ) . In addition , an increase in the cellular uptake efficiency of the exosomes ( approximately a 5 - fold increase ) by the addition of EGF was observed even under in the presence of serum [ 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , which contains a high amount of pre - existing bovine serum exosomes ] ( Fig . 2b ) . CD63 - GFP - exosomes that were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described in the Methods section were also tested , and sim - ilar results showing enhanced cellular uptake efficiency of the exosomes were observed under the same experimental conditions as described for Fig . 2b ( data not shown ) . The continuous addition of EGF ( 500 nM / day ) also significantly enhanced the cellular uptake of exosomes ( approximately 40 - fold ) com - pared with the absence of EGF ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Additionally , increased EGFR expression by transfection of the EGFR gene increased the internalisation of CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) in the presence of EGF ( 500 nM ; Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Dextran ( 70 kDa ) is a marker molecule for the macropinocytosis pathway 40 , 41 . Supplementary Fig . 2c shows the confocal microscopic results of A431 cells treated with Texas Red - labelled dextran ( 70 kDa , 0 . 5 mg / ml ) for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of EGF ( 500 nM ) . In the absence of EGF , the fluo - rescent signals of the Texas Red - labelled dextran taken up by the cells were low ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . On the other hand , the addition of EGF increased the cellular uptake of the Texas Red - labelled dextran ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Under the same experimental conditions , the cellular uptake of FITC - labelled dextran ( 70 kDa , 0 . 5 mg / ml ) was analysed using a flow cytometer , and the addition of the EGF enhanced the internalisation of the dextran by cells based on the EGF concentration ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . When A431 cells were treated with CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) and Texas Red - labelled dextran ( 70 kDa , 0 . 5 mg / ml ) in the presence of EGF ( 500 nM ) , fluorescent exosome signals and dextran taken up by the cells were highly colocalised inside the cells ( Fig . 2c ) , suggesting that the cellular uptake of exosomes in this experimental condition occurs through the macropinocytosis pathway . In addition , the internalisation efficacy of exosomes by the cells in the presence of EGF was significantly reduced by treatment with the macropinocytosis inhibitor 5 - ( N - ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amirolide ( EIPA ) 24 , 42 ( Fig . 2d ) . Macropinocytosis induction via CXCR4 increases the cellular uptake of exosomes . CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor ( C - X - C chemokine receptor type 4 ) , and an increased expression of this recep - tor has been related to cancer progression 43 , 44 . Stromal cell - derived factor 1 α ( SDF - 1 α ) is a natural CXCR4 ligand , and the stimulation of CXCR4 by treatment with SDF - 1 α induces CXCR4 endocytosis and actin polymerisation 45 , 46 , leading to macropinocytotic cellular uptake 47 . The effect of CXCR4 stim - ulation by SDF - 1 α on the cellular uptake of exosomes was also examined . HeLa cells were treated with CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) for 24 h , followed by flow cytometer analysis . The results showed that the addition of SDF - 1 α increased the internalisation of exosomes by the cells ( approximately 2 . 3 - fold by co - treatment with SDF - 1 α ( 200 nM ) with the exosomes ) even in 10 % FBS - containing cell culture medium , suggesting that CXCR4 - dependent macropinocytosis also increases the cellular uptake of exosomes . Enhanced cellular uptake of exosomes via the macropinocytosis pathway by oncogenic Ras . The expression of the oncogenic Ras protein in tumour cells has been shown to induce macropino - cytosis 48 – 50 . Commisso et al . recently reported that Ras - transformed tumour cells transport extracellular www . nature . com / scientificreports / 5 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10300 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10300 proteins through the macropinocytosis pathway 29 . The macropinocytosis pathway was shown to be an important route for the cellular uptake of nutrients in tumours , and the growth of the Ras - transformed pancreatic tumour xenografts was inhibited by treatment with the macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA 29 . In this research , we examined the cellular uptake efficacy of exosomes by Ras - transformed tumour cells ( Fig . 3 ) . MIA PaCa - 2 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells are homozygous for the K - Ras G12C allele , and the cells highly induce macropinocytosis to transport extracellular proteins into the cells as an important route of nutrient uptake 27 – 29 . In Fig . 3 , we show the cellular uptake efficiency of exosomes by MIA PaCa - 2 cells compared with that of BxPC - 3 cells , which express wild - type K - Ras , to assess the effects of oncogenic Ras expression and macropinocytosis in the cellular uptake of exosomes . Figure 3a shows the relative cellular uptake of CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) by MIA PaCa - 2 or BxPC - 3 cells in the presence or absence of EGF ( 500 nM ) for 24 h at 37 °C analysed using flow cytometer . Both in the presence and absence of EGF stimulation , the efficiency of the cellular uptake of exosomes in the MIA PaCa - 2 cells was superior ( approximately 14 fold in the absence of EGF ) to that of the BxPC - 3 cells ( Fig . 3a ) . In this experimental condition , internalisation of FITC - labelled dextran , which is a marker of macropinocytosis , by MIA PaCa - 2 cells was shown to be higher than in BxPC - 3 cells ( Fig . 3b ) . On the other hand , internalisation of FITC - labelled transferrin , which is a marker of clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis , by MIA PaCa - 2 cells was shown to be substantially lower than that of BxPC - 3 cells ( Fig . 3c ) . Colocalisation of internalised exosomes and Texas Red - labelled dextran inside MIA PaCa - 2 cells was observed using a confocal microscope ( Fig . 3d ) . These results suggest that macropinocytosis increased by oncogenic Ras enhances the cellular uptake efficacy of exosomes similar to the uptake of nutrients by tumour cells . Macropinocytosis induction enhances cytotoxicity of saporin - encapsulated exosomes . CD63 - GFP - exosomes secreted from HeLa cells did not induce cytotoxicity in A431 cells even under the experimental condition of serum - free medium with the addition of EGF ( Fig . 4a ) . We next examined the delivery of bioactive molecules by encapsulation in exosomes . Saporin ( approximately 30 kDa ) is a ribosome - inactivating protein that inhibits protein synthesis and the growth of targeted cells 51 . Encapsulation of saporin in exosomes was conducted by electroporation . As described in the Methods section , the electroporation method was optimized for poring pulse ( 50 , 100 , 200 , 300 V ) , result - ing in encapsulation of FITC - labeled saporin ( 45 , 65 , 120 , 105 ng / ml ) in 20 μ g / ml of exosomes , respec - tively . TEM analysis showed almost no morphological change after the electroporation condition ( poring pulse , 200 V ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . We also assessed aggregation of the proteins after electroporation as pointed out by Kooijmans et al . 52 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Kooijmans et al . reported that extensive aggregation of siRNAs by electroporation ( 400 V ) analysed using confocal microscope 52 . We found that high voltage ( 300 V ) electroporation showed aggregation of FITC - saporin - exosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . In the condition of 200 V electroporation , aggregation of FITC - saporin - exosomes was significantly improved ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . The aggregation might reduce encapsulation efficacy of FITC - saporin in exosomes in the electroporation condition of 300 V . Therefore , we used an experimental poring pulse of 200 V in the electroporation steps . A431 cells were treated with saporin - encapsulated exosomes ( 4 μ g / ml of total saporin - encapsulated exosomes ) or saporin ( 7 μ g / ml of saporin ) in 10 % FBS - containing cell cul - ture medium for 48 h at 37 °C , prior to a WST - 1 assay ( Fig . 4b ) . In the treatment of saporin - encapsulated exosomes , the addition of EGF ( 500 nM ) significantly enhanced cytotoxicity ( Fig . 4b ) , suggesting that the induction of macropinocytosis by EGF stimulation increases the cellular uptake of saporin - encapsulated exosomes and saporin bioactivity inside cells . In contrast , a high concentration of saporin only slightly increased cytotoxicity by EGF stimulation in this experimental condition ( Fig . 4b ) . EGF encapsulation enhances the cellular uptake efficacy of exosomes . Next , we examined the effects of EGF encapsulation in exosomes on the cellular uptake efficacy of the exosomes without modification of EGF on exosomal membranes ( Fig . 5 ) . The localised delivery of EGF for tissue and cell repair is a very important technique , as growth factor therapies activate and regulate a variety of cellular functions 53 , 54 . Marquez et al . recently reported the potential usage of liposomes to carry EGF to enhance the bone - healing process in injured rat alveoli , and EGF - encapsulated liposomes produced a more rapid recovery of the wound 55 . EGF has been shown to recycle by exocytosis after cellular uptake via endo - cytosis 56 . Therefore , after the cellular uptake of EGF - encapsulated liposomes , the release of EGF from liposomes in endosomes possibly induces EGF recycling , and secreted EGF from the cells by exocytosis stimulates EGFR expression at cellular plasma membranes . We also tested our hypothesis that encapsu - lated EGF in exosomes releases EGF from endosomes after cellular uptake , and recycled EGF stimulates the EGFR , leading to an enhanced macropinocytosis pathway and exosome uptake by cells . Encapsulation of EGF in exosomes was achieved by electroporation as described in the Methods section , and inter - nalisation of the exosomes by A431 cells was assessed . In addition , transferrin ( clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ) - encapsulated exosomes was also prepared by electroporation similar to that of EGF . Figure 5a shows the confocal microscopic images of A431 cells treated with EGF - or transferrin - encapsulated CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) for 24 h at 37 °C . Based on the results , the highest fluorescent intensity of internalised EGF - encapsulated CD63 - GFP - exosomes inside the cells was observed compared with that of CD63 - GFP - exosomes without encapsulation as a control and with encapsulation of transferrin ( Fig . 5a ) . The relative cellular uptake of each exosome was also assessed using a flow cytometer , and EGF www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10300 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10300 encapsulation enhanced the cellular uptake of the exosomes ( approximately 8 fold of control ; Fig . 5b ) . On the other hand , transferrin encapsulation slightly increased exosome internalisation ( Fig . 5b ) . These results suggest that EGF encapsulation significantly affects the cellular uptake of exosomes , and this sim - ple technique is considered very useful for enhancing exosome internalisation by targeted cells . The results of exosome - mediated saporin delivery using the method of EGF encapsulation are also shown in Fig . 6 . Similar to Fig . 4b , saporin - encapsulated CD63 - GFP - exosomes were prepared in the pres - ence or absence of EGF by the electroporation method as described in the Methods section . Fig . 6a shows the microscopic observation of A431 cells treated with saporin - or both saporin - and EGF - encapsulated exosomes ( 0 . 4 , 4 , 20 μ g / ml ) for 72 h at 37 °C in 10 % FBS - containing cell culture medium . Surprisingly , a low concentration ( 0 . 4 μ g / ml ) of saporin - EGF - exosomes prevented A431 cellular proliferation , and 4 μ g / ml of saporin - EGF - exosomes induced significant levels of cell death ( Fig . 6a ) . On the other hand , 0 . 4 and 4 μ g / ml of saporin - exosomes without EGF encapsulation did not induce morphological changes in the A431 cells , and a high concentration ( 20 μ g / ml ) of saporin - exosomes inhibited A431 cellular pro - liferation ( Fig . 6a ) . A WST - 1 assay for the detection of cell viability was also conducted using the same experimental conditions as in Fig . 6a , and co - encapsulation of EGF in exosomes effectively enhanced the cytotoxicity of encapsulated saporin to the A431 cells even at a low exosome concentration ( 0 . 4 μ g / ml ; Fig . 6b ) . The results support the findings of enhanced cellular uptake of exosomes by encapsulation of EGF in Fig . 5 , and this simple technique is considered a very useful method for the delivery of bio - functional proteins into cells to successfully attain the bioactivity of encapsulated therapeutic molecules in targeted cells . Discussion Cellular uptake mechanisms of exosomes have been studied particularly in the endocytosis pathway , as noted in the Introduction section 20 – 23 , and certain membrane exosome proteins , including milk fat globule ( MFG ) - E8 / lactadherin , CD11a , CD54 , CD9 , and CD81 20 , have been shown to possibly partici - pate in the cellular uptake of exosomes as ligand proteins . Ligand - receptor interactions on the recipient cell surface are considered trigger points for their cellular uptake . The expression levels of the ligand proteins on the exosome membrane and receptors on the recipient cell surface possibly affect the effica - cies of cell membrane accumulation of the exosomes . However , even though ligand - receptor interaction leads to binding and accumulation of exosomes on the recipient cell surface , whether receptor - mediated endocytosis is induced by receptor activation is an important point that should be elucidated to under - stand the cellular uptake mechanisms for exosomes . On the other hand , we here demonstrated active cellular uptake of exosomes through the macropinocytosis pathway , which is induced by stimulation of macropinocytosis - related receptors and oncogenic Ras protein ( Fig . 1 ) that highly contribute to tumour progression . The physiologic environment , including the concentration of extracellular pro - teins , positively affects cellular signalling through the receptors , and expression levels of the receptors determine cellular responses , including cellular uptake . As shown in Fig . 2 , A431 cells highly express EGFR on the plasma membrane , and stimulation of the receptor by treatment with the receptor ligand EGF significantly enhanced exosome internalisation by the cells ( Fig . 2a , b ) . The expression level of macropinocytosis - related receptors and the concentration of their receptor ligands are important factors for the cellular uptake of exosomes , which might regulate cellular responses by exosomal content after their cellular uptake . Thus , consideration of not only exosomal membrane proteins that participate in their cellular uptake but also activation of macropinocytosis - related receptors by their receptor ligands , which exist in human fluids , including blood , are very important for the elucidation of cellular uptake mechanisms and cell - to - cell communications . Activation of tyrosine kinase receptors , such as EGFR and platelet - derived growth factor receptor , intensely increases actin polymerisation in cell peripheral membrane regions , leading to actin - mediated membrane ruffling and macropinosome formation 24 , 25 . Macropinocytosis can uptake a large volume ( more than 1 μ m in size ) of extracellular fluid molecules into cells 30 . On the other hand , endocyto - sis , including clathrin - mediated endocytosis and caveolin - mediated endocytosis , has a size limitation of approximately ~ 100 nm for their cellular uptake , which is regulated by membrane curvature and self - assembly of protein scaffolds including clathrin coats 25 , 30 . Exosomes have been shown to be approxi - mately ~ 100 nm in size 37 – 39 , leading to a low efficiency of their cellular uptake via endocytosis . Exosomal membranes are also negatively charged 37 – 39 , leading to hindered accumulation on negatively charged cell membranes . Considering these exosome characteristics , macropinocytosis is an effective pathway for the efficient cellular uptake of exosomes , which might relate to cell - to - cell communications . Even in the presence of serum , in which many bovine - derived exosomes exist and might compete with the cellular uptake of CD63 - GFP - exosomes , stimulation of EGFR with the receptor ligand EGF significantly enhanced internalisation of the CD63 - GFP - exosomes by A431 cells ( Fig . 2b ) , suggesting the possibility of macropinocytosis - mediated control of their cellular uptake in vivo , although further detailed studies should be conducted to confirm the mechanisms in vivo . Macropinosomes in EGF - stimulated A431 cells have been shown to be difficult to fuse with lysosomes and to be recycled back to the extracellu - lar fluid 24 , 57 , 58 , suggesting that digestion of exosomal contents might be prevented before the release of exosomal content from exosomes and macropinosomes in the cellular uptake pathway . The recycling is considered to affect the bioactivities of exosomal content inside cells , which are dependent on cellular mechanisms of macropinocytosis pathways . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 7 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10300 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10300 Macropinocytosis has also been shown to play important roles for antigen presentation in dendritic cells and macrophages 59 , 60 , and the role of exosomes in their macropinocytotic cellular uptake has been hypothesised ; further studies are urgently needed . Some pathogens , including Salmonella typhimurium , also induce macropinocytosis for their internalisation into the host cells 61 , 62 , and biological effects of exosomes in invasion and intracellular parasitism of the pathogen are expected . Thus , cell biological events based on macropinocytosis in physiological environments possibly include the cellular uptake of exosomes that contain biofunctional molecules , and further studies of the biological events from the view points of exosomes are required to elucidate their hidden mechanisms . Stimulated macropinocytosis by expression of oncogenic Ras protein has been reported 48 – 50 . The ras family consists of three proto - oncogenes ( H - ras , K - ras , N - ras ) , each of which acquires oncogenic prop - erties by single mutations 48 . The mutated ras genes have been implicated in tumourigenesis 48 . Oncogenic K - Ras is a more potent Rac activator than H - Ras , leading to the induction of effective membrane ruf - fling 49 . Commisso et al . recently reported that Ras - transformed cells ( MIA - PaCa - 2 cells , homozygous K - Ras G12C allele ; NIH3T3 K - Ras V12 cells ) use macropinocytosis as an important route for nutrient uptake in tumours 29 . Macropinocytotic cellular uptake of albumin was shown to sustain proliferation of onco - genic Ras - transformed cells by constituting a source of glutamine and other amino acids 29 . The growth efficacy of Ras - transformed pancreatic tumour xenografts was significantly reduced by the macropinocy - tosis inhibitor EIPA 29 . In our research , MIA PaCa - 2 cells showed more effective macropinocytotic cellular uptake compared with wild - type K - Ras - expressing BxPC - 3 cells ( Fig . 3b ) , as previously reported 29 , and a high efficacy of cellular uptake of exosomes by MIA PaCa - 2 cells was detected with further enhancement of cellular uptake by EGFR stimulation ( Fig . 3a ) . On the other hand , iron is an essential nutrient for Figure 3 . Macropinocytosis pathway by oncogenic Ras expression increases cellular uptake of exosomes .

The stimulation of the transferrin receptor by Fe ( III ) - loaded transferrin does not induce macropinocy - tosis . Interestingly , Fig . 3c shows a very high efficacy of transferrin uptake in BxPC - 3 cells compared with that of MIA PaCa - 2 cells . Thus , cellular biological methods for nutrient uptake are different in each tumour based on clathrin - mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis , and macropinocytosis - mediated nutrient uptake might efficiently open routes for exosome uptake and the positive induction of cell reg - ulation by exosomal contents . Using an exosome cellular uptake route by macropinocytosis , we successfully attained the delivery of ribosome - inactivating protein , saporin , by encapsulation in exosomes ( Fig . 4b ) . As mentioned in the Results section , saporin inhibits protein synthesis in the cytosol , resulting in the growth inhibition of targeted cells 51 . Therefore , the effective cellular uptake of saporin - loaded exosomes and the cytosolic release of exosomal contents are needed in exosome - mediated intracellular delivery . The induction of macropinocytosis significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of saporin - loaded exosomes , although a high concentration of saporin , which was not encapsulated in exosomes , showed slight effects for cytotoxicity even in the macropinocytosis induction ( Fig . 4b ) . In the current experiments , the efficacy of cytosolic release of saporin from exosomes inside cells was not assessed , and the development of technology for the enhanced cytosolic release of exosomal contents is strongly needed for the effective delivery of ther - apeutic molecules using exosomes to attain their bioactivities in targeted cells as future works . We also demonstrated that encapsulation of EGF in exosomes enhances their cellular uptake ( Fig . 5 ) . The delivery of growth factors using liposomes has been shown to be a useful technique for bone healing to stimulate mesenchymal cell migration and osteoblast differentiation 55 . Considering the characteristics of EGF recycling through endocytosis and exocytosis 56 , the release of EGF from exosomes in the endo - cytosis pathway possibly induces EGF recycling , and secreted EGF from the cells by exocytosis stimulates EGFR in plasma membranes . As mentioned , macropinosomes in EGF - stimulated A431 cells have been shown to be recycled back to the extracellular fluid 24 , 57 , 58 . This method only relies on EGF encapsulation in exosomes without any modifications using exosome membrane proteins or lipids . Because covalent modification ( e . g . , conjugation with chemical linkers , gene expression engineering ) of membrane pro - teins and lipids possibly affect their biological functions , this simple technique of EGF encapsulation in exosomes is considered a beneficial method for maintaining the exosome membrane environments , although detailed studies are needed to assess the release and recycling of EGF , which is encapsulated in exosomes during their cellular uptake . In addition , co - encapsulation of EGF and saporin showed significant induction of cytotoxicity ( Fig . 6 ) . This simple methodology will be able to be applied to a wide variety of therapeutic molecules in exosome - mediated intracellular delivery for controlling cellular functions . In conclusion , we have demonstrated important roles of macropinocytosis in the efficient cellular uptake of exosomes . The macropinocytosis pathway , which is induced by cellular biological and envi - ronmental conditions , including related - receptor activation , oncogenic protein expression , and pathogen Figure 4 .

Although further studies on macropinocytosis - dependent cellular uptake of exosomes are needed , our findings will contribute to biological , pharmaceutical , and medical research fields for the understanding of biological functionalities of exosomes in various cellular events and con - ditions ( e . g . , cell - to - cell communications , cancer and other diseases , and infection ) under stimulated macropinocytosis and for the development of exosome - mediated delivery systems for future therapeutic and diagnostic applications .

Flow cytometry . Cells ( 4 . 7 × 10 4 cells , 1 ml ) were plated on a 24 - well microplate ( Iwaki ) and incu - bated for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After complete adhesion , the cells were washed with cell cul - ture medium ( three times , 200 μ l ) and treated with exosome samples , FITC - dextran ( 70 kDa , 0 . 5 mg / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , or FITC - transferrin ( 0 . 5 μ g / ml ; Rockland , Gilbertsville , PA , USA ) ( each 200 μ l / well ) , prior to washing with PBS ( three times , 200 μ l ) . The cells were then treated with trypsin ( 0 . 1 g / l ) - ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ; 0 . 11 mmol / l ; Nacalai Tesque ; 200 μ l / well ) at 37 °C for 10 min , prior to the addition of PBS ( 200 μ l ) , and centrifuged at 3 , 000 rpm ( 800 × g ) for 3 min at 4 °C . After removal of the supernatant , the cells were washed with PBS ( 400 μ l ) and centrifuged at 3 , 000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C . This washing cycle was repeated , and the cells were suspended in PBS ( 400 μ l ) and subjected to fluorescence analysis on a Guava EasyCyte ( Merck Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) flow cytometer using 488 nm laser excitation and a 525 nm emission filter . Living cells ( 10 , 000 cells / sample ) for the detection of cellular fluorescence intensity were counted based on forward scatter and side scat - ter analyses . For experiments using the macropinocytosis inhibitor , 5 - ( N - ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amiloride ( EIPA ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , cells were pre - treated with EIPA ( 20 μ M ) for 30 min at 37 °C before treatment with exosome samples in EIPA ( 20 μ M ) - containing cell culture medium ( 200 μ l / well ) . Preparation of FITC - labeled saporin and FITC - labeled EGF . Saporin ( 200 μ g , saporin from Saponaria officinalis seeds , Sigma - Aldrich ) or EGF ( 200 μ g ) dissolved in H 2 O ( 100 μ l ) was mixed with FITC ( 2 equivalents , Sigma - Aldrich ) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( 10 μ l ) and N , N - diisopropylethylamine ( 0 . 5 μ l ) at 30 °C for 2 h . Gel filtration on a Sephadex G - 25 column ( PD - 10 , GE Healthcare ) was con - ducted for the removal of unreacted FITC prior to lyophilisation . Concentration of the protein was determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc . ) . Encapsulation of proteins into exosomes . To load saporin into exosomes ( saporin from Saponaria officinalis seeds , Sigma - Aldrich ) , CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 25 μ g ) were mixed with saporin ( 50 μ g ) in PBS ( 100 μ l ) . After electroporation ( poring pulse : twice pulse ( 5 msec ) , transfer pulse : five pulse ( 20 V , 50 msec ) ) in a 1 - cm electroporation cuvette at room temperature using a super electropolater NEPA21 TypeII ( NEPA genes , Tokyo , Japan ) , the removal of unencapsulated proteins was accomplished by washing and filtration using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters ( 100 K device , Merck Millipore ; triple washing with 500 μ l PBS , 18 , 000 × g , 4 °C , 10 min ) . For encapsulation of saporin with human EGF or human transfer - rin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , EGF ( 25 μ g ) or transferrin ( 100 μ g ) was added to saporin and CD63 - GFP - exosome samples before electroporation . FITC - labeled saporin loaded in exosomes were confirmed using a spectrofluometer ( FP - 6200 , JASCO , Tokyo , Japan ) . The electroporation method was optimized for poring pulse ( 50 , 100 , 200 , 300 V ) , resulting in encapsulation of FITC - labeled saporin ( 45 , 65 , 120 , 105 ng / ml ) in 20 μ g / ml of exosomes , respectively . Therefore , we used an experimental poring pulse of 200 V in the electroporation steps . The efficiency of saporin encapsulation into exosomes was calculated to be 0 . 2 % . In the same electroporation condition ( 200 V ) , the concentration of EGF or transferrin encapsulated in 20 μ g / ml exosomes was estimated to be around 550 ng / ml ( EGF ) or 1 . 8 μ g / ml ( transferrin ) using the FITC - labeled EGF and FITC - labeled transferrin ( Molecular Probes ) . The efficiency of encapsulation into exosomes was calculated to be 2 . 8 % ( EGF ) and 2 . 3 % ( transferrin ) . Cell viability ( WST - 1 assay ) . Cell viability was analysed using a 4 - [ 3 - ( 4 - iodophenyl ) - 2 - ( 4 - nitro - phenyl ) - 2H - 5 - tetrazolio ] - 1 , 3 - benzene disulfonate ( WST - 1 ) assay as previously described 65 . Cells ( 1 × 10 4 cells , 100 μ l ) were incubated in 96 - well microplates for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . The cells were then treated with exosome samples ( 50 μ l ) for each experimental period at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After the sample treatment , WST - 1 reagent ( 10 μ l ) was added to each well , and the samples were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm ( A 450 ) and 620 nm ( A 620 ) , and the value obtained by subtracting A 620 from A 450 corresponded to the viable cell number . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 12 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10300 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10300 Western blot analysis . Isolated exosomes were added to lysis buffer ( 62 . 5 mM Tris - HCl ( pH = 6 . 8 ) , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 002 % bromophenol blue , 5 % 2 - mercaptoethanol ) . The boiled samples were sep - arated by 10 % SDS - PAGE , transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) , and treated with anti - CD63 antibody ( TS63 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) . A sec - ondary antibody labelled with horseradish peroxidase ( anti - mouse IgG HRP - linked whole antibody , GE Healthcare ) was used , and immunoreactive species were detected by an Enhanced Chemiluminescence ( ECL ) Plus Western Blotting Detection System ( GE Healthcare ) . For the detection of EGFR , A431 cells ( 2 × 10 5 cells , 2 ml ) were plated on a 12 - well microplate ( Iwaki ) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After complete adhesion , the cells were washed with cell culture medium ( triple washing , 200 μ l ) and treated with EGF ( 100 nM ) for 1 min at 37 °C . After EGF treatment , the cells were scraped in lysis buffer ( 200 μ l ) . The boiled lysate samples were separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes as described above . The membranes were treated with a p - EGFR ( Tyr1173 ) antibody ( sc - 12351 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and an EGFR antibody ( sc - 03 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and a secondary antibody labelled with horseradish peroxidase ( anti - rabbit IgG HRP - linked whole antibody , GE Healthcare ) was used , prior to the detection of immunoreactive species . Statistic analyses . All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software ( ver . 5 . 00 ; GraphPad , San Diego , CA , USA ) . For comparison of two groups , unpaired Student’s t - test was used after verification of the equal variances by F - test . The Welch’s correction was performed when the variances across groups are assumed to be unequal . For multiple comparison analyses , either one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Tukey’s post - hoc test or two - way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post - hoc test were used . Differences were considered significant when the calculated p - value was < 0 . 05 . References 1 . Tan , A . , Rajadas , J . & Seifalian , A . M .
