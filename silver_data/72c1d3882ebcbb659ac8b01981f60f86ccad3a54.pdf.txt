The nanocarriers are cloaked in cell membranes , which enables them to incorporate the functions of natural cells . Key scientific concepts of review : Nanocarriers surface engineered with cell membranes have emerged as a fas - cinating source of materials for cancer targeted chemotherapy . A distinctive characteristic of cell membrane - coated nanocarriers ( CMCNs ) is that they include carbohydrates , proteins , and lipids , in addition to being biocompatible . CMCNs are capable of interacting with the complicated biological milieu of the tumor because they contain the signaling networks and intrinsic functions of their parent cells . Numerous cell membranes have been investigated for the purpose of masking nanocarriers with membranes , and various tumor - targeting methods have been devised to improve cancer targeted chemotherapy . Moreover , the diverse structure of the membrane from different cell sources broadens the spectrum of CMCNs and offers an entirely new class of drug - delivery systems . Aim of review : This review will describe the manufacturing processes for CMCNs and the therapeutic uses for dif - ferent kinds of cell membrane - coated nanocarrier - based drug delivery systems , as well as addressing obstacles and future prospects .

Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 Background Cancer has been a worldwide concern for a long period of time and is the second largest cause of mortality [ 1 ] . Conventional chemotherapy , as one of the most fre - quently used methods for cancer treatment , remains unsatisfactory owing to the significant side effects and the poor targeting ability of anti - cancer drugs [ 2 ] . To overcome these issues , significant research and devel - opment has been conducted on targeted drug delivery systems ( TDDS ) , particularly nanocarrier - based TDDS [ 3 ] . The benefits of nanocarriers , which include the ability to be modified , a large capacity for drug load - ing , and tunable physiochemical characteristics , make them ideal for encapsulating anti - cancer drugs and altering their stability , solubility , and in vivo behaviour [ 4 ] . Nevertheless , surface modification of nanocarriers may enhance their blood circulation and enable more precise targeting , thus increasing effectiveness while trying to minimize side effects [ 5 ] . However , there are also many disadvantages that make it difficult for nano - carriers to live up to clinical standards . The immune system recognizes and eliminates the majority of nano - carriers as foreign substances . Since the polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , a hydrophilic polymer , was initially incor - porated into a protein medication [ 6 ] , PEGylation has been the most frequently utilized modification tech - nique in drug delivery applications [ 7 ] . Additionally , the targeted capacity of nanocarriers was highly reli - ant on the surface modification , which was challenging to manufacture and accomplish [ 8 ] . As a result , TDDS delivered through nanoparticles has not yet achieved its full therapeutic potential . The drug - delivery system’s ( DDSs ) technology contin - ues to advance , making it possible to administer more potent drugs [ 9 ] . Drug research efforts are significantly aided by therapeutic compounds’ capacity to remain intact in a hostile extracellular milieu [ 10 ] . In this con - nection , efforts to reduce immunogenicity and improve biopharmaceutical stability through modification of biopharmaceuticals have increased [ 11 ] . Cells in the early 1980s were used as drug delivery vehicles , which substan - tially increased the drugs’ retention and targeting capa - bilities [ 12 ] . Despite the increasing use of live cell - based carriers , several shortcomings persist . One major con - cern is passenger drug activity , as drugs may be digested by the cell carrier’s lysosomes [ 13 ] . Moreover , drug release is difficult to control due to exocytosis or leak - age during transport [ 14 ] . Faced with these challenges , scientists recently discovered a natural way to design biomimetic cell membrane nanocarriers . At first , the bio - mimetic cell membrane nanocarriers were made from a poly ( lactic - co - glycolic acid ) ( PLGA ) core and a red blood cell ( RBC ) membrane shell , using a co - extrusion process [ 15 ] . Then , different cell membrane - coated nanocarriers ( CMCNs ) were explored with different nanocarrier cores and membrane materials . The incorporation of nanocar - riers into the cell membrane merges the advantages of material science and biomimicry . It is important to note that CMCNs can be portrayed as autogenous cells to pro - long blood circulation time and avoid immune system Graphical Abstract Page 3 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 elimination , both of which are required for the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect of cancer tar - geted chemotherapy [ 16 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Moreover , different cell membranes may confer dif - ferent functions on CMCNs , resulting in varying in vivo behaviour . Biomimetic technology , a relatively new pro - cedure , satisfies these requirements and is currently being used in designing drug nanocarriers [ 17 , 18 ] . By drawing inspiration from nature that comprises biologi - cal elements and living matter , this technology aims to overcome the shortcomings of current drug delivery sys - tems . An ideal biomimetic delivery system exploits path - ogens’ immune evasion and intracellular uptake tactics . However , delivery systems derived from pathogens con - tinue to raise safety concerns , including immunogenicity and virulence [ 19 ] . Advantages of CMCNs based drug delivery systems CMCNs have notably contributed to suppressing drug resistance in the use of nanocarriers for cancer thera - pies . Biomimetic CMCNs possess special characteristics , such as prolonged drug delivery , immunological eva - sion , homotypic targeting , longer blood circulation , and specific ligand / receptor recognition . To get beyond the restrictions of cell toxicity , differentiation , and sensitivity in cell - based delivery systems , CMCNs utilize therapeu - tically relevant cell membrane proteins as an alternative to the whole cell . Because a longer circulation time ben - efits with the potential of sustained drug delivery and increases the probability of sustained distribution into the circulation [ 20 ] . The biomimetic CMCNs provide bio - modulation and more control in this regard . The CMCNs prepared by coating RBC membrane on PLGA nanocarriers improved the nanocarriers’ retention in the blood by 72 hours , compared to 15 . 8 hours for typi - cal synthetic stealth nanocarriers [ 15 ] . Moreover , PLGA nanocarriers with a fluorocarbon core masked in an RBC membrane were used for delivering oxygen to solid tumours , demonstrating another application of CMCNs delivery to improve blood circulation time via the EPR approach [ 21 ] . The reduced immunogenic characteristics of cancer cell membranes and their homing abilities improve tar - geted drug delivery at the cancer site . In this respect , Cao et al . investigated the interaction between VCAM - 1 of metastatic cancer cells with macrophage α4 proteins to transport cytotoxic anticancer drugs to the lungs [ 22 ] . Using the adhesion characteristics of galectin - 3 and T antigen in cancer cell membranes , Fang et al . demon - strated homotypic tumour targeting [ 23 ] . Furthermore , when compared to other active targeting methods , incor - porating iron oxide nanocarriers into fractured cancer cell membranes for tumor targeting demonstrated supe - rior homing to homologous tumors in vivo [ 24 ] . Recently Fig . 1 Nanocarriers with a cell membrane coating for cancer drug delivery . Different types of cell membranes are used to encapsulate various types of nanocarrier core for cancer treatment Page 4 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 designed leuko - like vectors ( LLV ) targeting metastatic niches utilizing neutrophil membrane - coated nanocarri - ers have shown a two - to threefold increase in metastatic foci accumulation compared to PLGA - PEG nanocarri - ers and bare nanocarriers , respectively [ 25 ] . This affin - ity for metastatic niches is enhanced by the presence of N cadherin , Mac - 1 , and other sticky proteins produced on neutrophil membranes on CMCNs , as opposed to the usual PEG coating employed to prolong circulation half - life and prevent clearance [ 26 ] . Interestingly , PLGA nanocarriers coated with T lymphocyte membranes were also capable of retaining their lymphocyte coating and evading lysosome sequestration , while bare nanocarri - ers were caught in endolysosomal compartments prone to breakdown in in vivo [ 27 ] . Moreover , this study also discovered that T lymphocyte - coated nanocarriers had a twofold increase in particle density throughout tumours in mice when compared to naked nanocarriers . Numer - ous additional research groups are attempting to harness the cell membrane’s inherent properties to create biomi - metic drug carriers for cancer treatments . Considerations of CMCNs Choice of cell membrane A thorough understanding of the homeostasis , func - tion , and structure of cells in their complex physiologi - cal context provides key hints for better biointerfacing of synthetic DDSs [ 28 ] . A delivery system with the abil - ity to protect cargo and carry cell features like autono - mous activity , compartmentalization , flexibility , and form can be more convenient and beneficial than other delivery systems . The cell membrane repeats the surface functionality of cells and extracellular vesicles as it is the fundamental structural component of them . It is primar - ily made up of carbohydrates , proteins , and lipids , and it interacts with the environment to survive and grow [ 29 ] . Carbohydrates play a part in cellular recognition , whereas proteins are responsible for adhesion and sign - aling , and lipid bilayer formation combines structural fluidity and stiffness [ 30 – 32 ] . Cell membranes can be dif - ferentiated based on the properties and composition of these three components in them . The potential to profit from native cell membrane functions has sparked tre - mendous scientific interest in coating nanocarriers . If done appropriately , the cell membrane retains its capabil - ity , and its coating enhances biointerfacing . The selection of the appropriate cell type or cell mem - brane is crucial for ensuring site - specific distribution and targeting as well as for minimizing adverse interac - tions with complementing systems in vivo . Every cell type has unique biological features , making them suitable for certain therapeutic applications such as infectious dis - eases , inflammatory diseases , cancer , and personalized therapy [ 33 ] . For example , the membrane of RBCs is rich with glycophorins that play a key role in attracting pathogens to their surface and killing them via oxytosis [ 32 ] . The application of an RBC membrane to the nano - carriers thereby increases pathogen clearance , long - term circulation , and cell viability . Platelets interact with injured endothelial cells and engage with immune cells to mobilize them toward the inflamed site [ 34 ] . As a result , covering the nanocarriers with the platelet mem - branes allows for selective adherence to tumour tissues or wounded vessels , targeting circulatory tumour cells , pathogen eradication , and the capability to elude detec - tion by macrophages . Similarly , macrophage membranes like other leukocytes carry adhesion molecules like VLA - 4 , LFA - 1 , PSGL - 1 , L - selectin , and P - selectin that help with cell adherence [ 35 ] . Thus , coating the nanocar - rier with macrophage membrane has the ability to bind pathogens while avoiding macrophage recognition and offering active targeting at the cancer site . Moreover , tumor - specific adhesion molecules and antigens such as mucoprotein - 1 , epithelial - adhesion molecules , lympho - cyte - homing receptors ( like CD44 ) , galectin - 3 , integrins , and cadherins are overexpressed on the surface of cancer cell membranes [ 36 ] . These antigens and adhesion mol - ecules play a critical role in the contacts among cells and between cells and the surrounding tissue matrix . Gener - ally , cancer cell membranes can cling to their homolo - gous cells [ 37 ] . So , wrapping a nanocarrier with a cancer cell membrane prevents macrophage detection , allowing for homotypic tumour targeting , and contributes to the design of personalized cancer therapy . Cell source In order to use maximum cell membrane properties , it is essential to consider the state , form , and source of the cell . In this connection , Evangelopoulos et al . dem - onstrated that the cell source determines the immuno - genicity of biomimetic nanocarriers [ 38 ] . They studied multilayer cell membrane generated vesicles from various sources for phagocytosis , opsonization , and targeting of inflamed regions . Literature showed that the use of a syn - geneic cell membrane coating increased the avoidance of absorption by the liver and immunological repertoire cells [ 38 ] . To isolate the cell membrane for the coating of nanocarriers , it is preferred to choose homotypic cells in a healthy state and nourishing phase . The real thera - peutic effectiveness of CMCNs requires homogeneity of the cell population . To fulfil this requirement , quanti - fication or expression levels of specific surface markers ( e . g . , receptors or ligands ) plays a dominant role . For this purpose , flow cytometry , Blot Western , and SDS - PAGE techniques can be used to evaluate the cellular state and homogeneity of cell membranes [ 39 ] . Identification of Page 5 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 cell biomarkers and other ligands for signal transduction , targeting , or any other approach would enhance transla - tional effects . Membrane stability CMCNs are preferred for use over targeting nanocar - riers prepared via a bottom - up approach because they possess numerous characteristics , including signal trans - duction , immune evasion , targeting , and therapeutic advantages . To maximize the therapeutic potential of CMCNs , the structural and functional characteristics of the cell membrane should be preserved prior to coating drug carriers . The cell membrane’s stability is critical in determining the overall durability of CMCNs . The micro - environment of tissue and circulation naturally creates torque and shear forces on cells and nanocarriers . Cells survive with these forces and respond to them by actively modulating their cytoskeleton - membrane interactions , lipid profile , ligand density , and ligand concentration . For example , the interaction of intracellular proteins with the cell membrane strengthens the reliability of natural cells . During the isolation of the membrane , some key stability regulators of the cell membrane may be lost or changed . As a result , determining the overall membrane stability of CMCNs becomes critical before moving further with biomimetic - based treatment [ 40 ] . Numerous techniques for determining the stability of membrane structures are described in the literature . For visualizing the structural integrity and morphology of cell membranes , advanced fluorescence , lipophilic dye enhanced , Cryo - TEM , and spectrophotometric techniques , for example , are all extremely useful [ 41 ] . When it comes to the mechanical or elastic integrity of membranes , ektacytometry may be the best tool for determining membrane elongation in dynamic shear stress [ 42 ] . Additionally , the source of lipid composition in the cell also influences the overall stability of CMCNs . In one study comparing the lipid - omic profiles of cells , a higher proportion of unsaturated phospholipids was observed in primary cell cultures than other cultured . X - ray scattering , FTIR , and colorimetric lipid assays are all useful tools for assessing the qualita - tive composition of phospholipids [ 43 ] . Membrane‑related proteins The CMCNs interact with the local environment of tis - sues and cells through proteins present on the cell mem - branes . So , the appropriate membrane proteins must be kept up in the cell culture . Several transfection and chemical signaling methods may be used to regulate protein expression and cellular states in culture . In fact , long - term cell growth of some cell types may alter their desirable characteristics for CMCNs applications . For example , the culture condition affects the phenotypes of mesenchymal stem cells , which vary across individu - als , cell groups , and even batches . The expansion of mes - enchymal stem cells in in vitro not only alters mRNA expression patterns but also affects the surface proteins involved in migration and adhesion ( e . g . , C - met / HGF , CXCR7 , CXCR4 , etc . ) [ 44 ] . In the case of nanocarriers coated with immune cell membrane , it is essential to con - sider the state and cellular source of immune cells , since they undergo different modifications throughout the pro - and post - inflammatory phases ( e . g . , pro - and post - inflammatory macrophages M1 and M2 ) . While obtaining the desired membranes is still an attractive approach , it is becoming increasingly favora - ble to modify the cell surface using proteins , peptides , or small molecules before harvesting the membranes [ 45 ] . In this scenario , cell membrane receptors are becoming less sensitive , and this is unknown at this time . In the case of highly biotinylated membranes of erythrocytes , they are more likely to be taken up by macrophages because of the presence of C3b proteins on them . It is suggested that biotinylation may also disable complement regulators or self - markers on the cell surface [ 46 ] . As CMCNs appear to have no significant effect on cellular behaviours , they do not entirely reflect what the cells naturally do . Stephan et al . performed a detailed investigation of nanocarriers - tethered T cells to monitor synapse formation , transmi - gration , antigen , and cell division . They found that the ability of the cell to perform physiological functions was not affected by the conjugation of nanocarriers to the cell membrane [ 40 ] . The degree of immune response vari - ability is proportional to the variety of different sources employed in cell membrane engineering and to the tech - nology used to design the membranes . To successfully apply biomimetic - based drug delivery applications to the clinic , it is essential to have extensive CMCNPs charac - terization and qualification . Cell membrane extraction In order to successfully isolate the cell membrane , cell membrane extraction protocols must ensure that there is minimal or no cytosol , mitochondrial , or nuclear contamination . Making use of a pure cell membrane improves surface coating efficiency and uniformity , allowing for maximum functional and structural replica - tion on the nanocarrier surface . To preserve membrane proteins from degeneration , the extraction medium is supplemented with phosphatase / protease inhibitor cock - tails that are stored at ice - cold temperatures . Prior to extraction , cells are thoroughly cleaned with saline buffer to remove any remaining remnants of the cell culture medium . Some cells lack nuclei ( e . g . , RBCs and platelets ) , mak - ing membrane extraction easy . During membrane Page 6 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 extraction , cells are separated first from their tissues using the most suitable techniques . For RBCs , a hypo - tonic treatment certainly disintegrates the cells and frees the cell membrane to collect through centrifugation in the form of a pink RBC pallet [ 47 ] . Again and again , cen - trifugation purifies the pallet from haemoglobin impu - rities . For platelets , it is recommended to do multiple freeze – thaw sequences to rapture their membrane by breaking ice crystals to release the cytosol [ 48 ] . The free cell membrane is then collected through centrifugation . Sometimes , the collected platelet membranes are treated with a discontinuous sucrose gradient to purify the plate - let membrane from any high - density granules , proteins , and intact platelets . Extraction of the membrane from nucleus - containing cells is slightly more difficult than from nucleus - free cells . Nucleus - containing cells include β - cells , fibroblasts , can - cer stem cells , and immune cells ( e . g . , T cells , NK cells , neutrophils , monocytes / macrophages ) . These cells can be isolated from established cell lines like MCF - 7 , 4T1 , J447 , NK - 92 , etc . , or from blood or tissues ( stem cells , cancer cells , T cells , neutrophils , NK cells , etc . ) . By com - bining hypotonic treatment with physical disruption pro - cedures , it produces an extract that contains high - density granules , intact cells , and free cell membranes . Finally , the cell membrane is isolated from the mixture through the use of discontinuous sucrose gradient ultrafiltration or differential centrifugation [ 49 , 50 ] . Membrane functional components such as cholesterol ( making structural components ) , carbohydrates ( cellular recognition components ) , and transmembrane proteins ( adhesion and signaling components ) can be lost dur - ing membrane isolation . Cholesterol helps keep the cell membrane rigid . This loss may reduce the membrane’s mechanical stability . Moreover , proteins also act as mem - brane skeleton stabilizers by selectively attaching to the junction complex as well as other membrane proteins such as tropomyosin [ 51 ] . Therefore , hypotonic buffers containing divalent ions ( such as MgCl 2 ) or even add - ing cholesterol can be effective in reducing protein loss while maintaining membrane stability [ 52 ] . Moreover , the right pH , soft rapturing procedures , proper ice - cold conditions , and mild lysis buffer must be adopted for membrane extraction to avoid denaturation of trans - membrane proteins / receptors . Once the cell membrane has been isolated , it is freeze dried and kept at − 80 °C to ensure that membrane proteins retain their long - term consistency and features . Choice of template A template is a structural component of the CMCNs which can be used for diagnosis and drug delivery due to its various desirable features . Templates can be classified as organic and inorganic , where liposomes , gelatin , and PLGA are organic templates , while inorganic templates include iron oxide ( Fe 3 O 4 ) , gold , mesoporous silica , upconversion nanoparticles ( UCNPs ) , PLNPs , and MOFs . Organic templates are simple to use and provide benefits , including biocompatibility , biodegradability , and nontoxicity [ 53 ] . Inorganic templates , on the other hand , have electrical , optical , and magnetic properties that influence their selection in a CMCN [ 54 ] . For clinical translation , template biodegradability and biocompatibility are critical which are influenced by the degradation and byproducts formation and their sub - sequent interactions with human body . 231 , 231 Renal clearance helps avoid the templates adverse effects [ 55 ] . FDA - approved templates are regarded the safest in terms of toxicities . Because most organic templates are safer than inorganic ones , they have been practiced in clini - cal trials [ 56 ] . In 2011 , a PLGA nanoparticle was used as a template to build these imitating systems [ 15 ] . As a synthetic polymer , PLGA can be fabricated into nano and microparticles and have been commonly used for RBC , platelets , cancer cells , neutrophils , dendritic cells , macrophages , cardiac stem cells , and various other tem - plates [ 47 , 49 , 57 – 60 ] . Gelatin , a natural polypeptide widely used in medicines , food , and cosmetics , has also been utilized for assembly of CMCNs . Patient - derived tumour cells , T - cell , stem cell , and RBC are employed to coat gelatin templates for CMCNs [ 61 – 64 ] . Liposomes have also been used as core for cancer cells , RBCs , and macrophages membranes [ 22 , 65 , 66 ] . Perfluorocarbons ( PFCs ) are also among the regulated templates where PFCs ( Fuosol - DA ) was approved in 1989 but was with - drawn from market shortly due to storage issues [ 67 ] . However , PFCs are biocompatible , biodegradable , and have high oxygen - carrying capacity with ~ 20 times greater than water thus can be used for oxygen delivery to smallest capillaries and hypoxic tumour locations [ 68 ] . The toxicity of inorganic templates depends on the type of utilized metal and its breakdown in vivo . Silica is the safest ( FDA - approved ) inorganic template and is biode - gradable and biocompatible [ 69 ] . It has been a research focus for templates due to certain properties including high surface area , porosity , and drugs or photosensitiz - ers loading capability [ 70 ] . CMCNs have been reported using spherical silica nanoparticles on RBC , cancer cells , and macrophage membranes [ 71 , 72 ] . Mesoporous silica nanoparticles can be tuned and chemically modified into various shapes and sizes for desired applications , e . g . , prolonged antibacterial property and regulating endoge - nous reactive oxygen species for oxidative treatment [ 73 ] . When combined with CMC mimics , these tunable fea - tures could offer therapeutic benefits . The surface charge of silica templates can be changed with 3 - aminopropyl Page 7 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 triethoxysilane for CTC detection [ 74 , 75 ] . Iron ions are harmless biodegradation products of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparti - cles . MSCs and HeLa cells were employed as membranes in several CMC mimics employing Fe 3 O 4 templates [ 76 – 78 ] . MOFs are 3D structures generated by the complexa - tion of organic ligands and metal ions [ 79 ] . Their toxicity is associated with the type of organic linkers and met - als employed . For example , zinc - based MOFs [ zeolitic imidazolate ( ZIF - 8 ) ] degrade to release Zn 2 + ions , an endogenous element with a less detrimental effect on the human body [ 80 ] . Post - degradation of TPP - based Gd / Zn MOFs releases gadolinium ( Gd 3 + ) and zinc ( Zn 2 + ) ions , where Gd 3 + is harmful to the kidneys and can pass the blood – brain barrier to accumulate in the brain [ 81 ] . Due to their structural arrangement , MOFs have excellent porosity , surface area , and photosensitizer loading capa - bility . Gold microparticles are another inorganic tem - plate , but they are not biodegradable and may be harmful thus , nano or ultra - small templates of gold for fast renal clearance is ideal [ 82 ] . Gold particles can be shaped into nanoparticles , nanoshells , nanorods , and nanocages , which are all used to fabricate CMCNs . Procedures for engineering CMCNs Preparation of CMCNs The preparation of CMCNs can be processed through four major steps . The first step is to separate the mem - branes from the parent cells by using a hypotonic buffer to lysate them . Second , the purification of the mixture to separate cellular components and cell membranes by centrifugation [ 83 ] . The centrifugation process will be different depending on the cell type . For example , irregu - lar sucrose gradient centrifugation is needed to prepare eukaryote cell membranes because this treatment sepa - rates the membrane from nuclei and other cell compo - nents . Whereas nuclei - free membranes like RBCs do not require this treatment . Third , preparation of the inner core . Liposomes , gelatin , PLGA , poly ( - caprolactone ) , iron oxide nanoparticles , gold nanoparticles , mesoporous silica nano - capsules , silicon nanoparticles , and other syn - thetic materials make up the inner cores . The inner core selection for CMCNs is based on the types of cargo to be transported ( Fig . 2 ) . To prepare CMCNs , the inner core nanoparticles and the cell membranes are fused together . The fusion pro - cess must be carried out in such a way that it should not result in protein denaturation or drug leakage . The two most frequently used procedures for the fusion of the inner core into cell membranes are ultrasonic treatment and membrane extrusion [ 84 , 85 ] . Sonication has been employed to fuse the PLGA core into the platelet mem - brane , which exhibits various “self - recognized” proteins [ 86 ] . The duration , power , and frequency of the sonica - tion should be adjusted to minimize drug leakage and protein denaturation and enhance fusion efficiency . In membrane extrusion , membranes are extruded using a Fig . 2 The preparation of cell membrane - coated nanocarriers is a multistep process . Cell membranes are typically synthesized in three steps : cell lysis , membrane separation , and extrusion to obtain homogenous cell membrane vesicles Page 8 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 technique known as sequential extrusion . In this tech - nique , samples ( a mixture of core nanoparticles and cell membrane ) are extruded through different - sized pores . It is crucial to control the nanoparticle - to - cell membrane ratio in order to ensure complete surface coverage for both of these techniques [ 87 ] . A new microfluidic elec - troporation - based procedure has recently been devel - oped to apply a full membrane coating on the inner core , which means that different factors , such as flow veloc - ity , duration , and voltage , must be tailored to meet the desired results [ 88 ] . Modification of cell membrane The structure , functions , and components of cell mem - branes have become more understandable as cell biology progresses [ 89 ] . The composition of the cell membrane is mainly composed of a lipid bilayer , while protein and car - bohydrate molecules are lodged in the hydrophobic part of the lipid layer [ 90 ] . One of the major functions of the cell membrane is to protect the intracellular organelles , which transport nutrients , process waste , and regulate metabolism . Moreover , cell - to - cell contacting signal - ing is also regulated by the cell membrane . Therefore , the cell membrane can be modified for desirable func - tions . The modification of the cell membrane may be processed either before disrupting the parent cells ( i . e . , pre - modification ) or additional components are subse - quently introduced into membranes after isolation ( i . e . , post - modification ) . In pre - modification , the properties of the parent cell membrane are modified at metabolic or genetic levels . Parent cells are treated with certain chemical or physi - cal stresses to induce the expression of specific lipid or protein components , or to modify the structure of mem - brane hydrocarbon chains [ 91 ] . Metabolic glycosylation is mainly used to control expression levels of native gly - cans , but it can also be used to introduce artificial mono - saccharides into glycol - conjugates [ 92 ] . RBCs are one of the most frequently used sources for generating vesicles derived from cell membranes . However , it is impossible to modify mature RBCs genetically due to the absence of nuclei in mature RBCs . To overcome this problem , Lv et al . used the CRISPR gene - editing strategy to engineer an RBC membrane expressing the tripeptide Asn - Gly - Arg ( NGR ) [ 93 ] . Transgenic mice were generated in this study by inserting NRG peptide coding in the pre - embryo stage . A genetic analysis of newborn mice was used to validate the NGR expression . RBCs were isolated from these mice and used to generate RBC membrane vesicles for targeted delivery of an oncolytic virus to tumors . As exogenous physical or chemical coupling onto vesicles may alter protein function , so genetic engineering allows the biosynthesis of certain proteins using the parental protein machinery . Pre - modification approach results in a more homog - enous and secure source of membrane , but the types of ligand and component possibilities are inadequate as compared to the post - modification approach . Several post - modification methods have been developed due to the availability of divers and convenience modified mate - rials . The materials used for modification range from nat - ural lipids [ 94 ] , nucleic acids [ 95 ] , and proteins [ 96 ] , to synthetic components [ 97 ] . Cholesterol is one lipid that is used to modify vesicles derived from cell membranes for CMCNs . It plays an important role in the formation of the cell membrane’s lipid bilayer structure . Changes in cholesterol ratios can affect the rigidity and fluidity of membranes [ 98 ] . The addition of cholesterol increases the stability of vesicles derived from cell membranes in terms of their resistance to environmental pH changes [ 94 ] . In the case of RBCs , adding cholesterol to RBCs and slightly heating them for 10 min increased the rigidity of their vesicles , significantly improving the efficacy of drug loading . Proteins can be conjugated to the cell mem - brane through insertion or conjugation . For instance , a bifunctional linker functionalized with N - hydroxysuc - cinimide at one end and maleimide at another terminal was used to conjugate hyaluronidase to the RBC mem - brane [ 96 ] . Another study used an amphiphilic lipid to anchor protein to the surface of a membrane vesicle [ 97 ] . In this approach , streptavidin was first attached to 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - [ maleimide ( polyethylene glycol ) - 2000 ] and then the lipid tail was inserted into the cell membrane . Inserting a protein - conjugated lipid into the cell membrane enables protein affixing without disturbing membrane surface proteins , thereby increasing the likelihood of membrane proteins retaining their intact structure . However , chemi - cal conjugation of lipid moieties with a protein may alter the configuration of associated proteins . Strategies for conjugating proteins with lipid moieties at specific sites must be carefully designed to minimize possible configu - rational changes . Another substance used to modify the vesicles derived from the cell membrane is nucleic acids . Aptamers are short single - strand oligonucleotides that may precisely attach to a target substrate . Peng et al . used the 26 - mer G - quadruplex oligonucleotide AS1411 , which binds to nucleolin , to modify the membrane of cancer cells [ 95 ] . The AS1411 aptamer enabled tumor - targeting of membrane vesicles because of the overexpression of nucleolin in tumor tissue ( Fig . 3 ) . It is well known that synthetic polymers , particularly PEG , have been used to modify cell membrane for the preparation of CMCNs [ 99 , 100 ] . By protecting CMCNs from phagocytosis , PEG conjugation increases their Page 9 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 colloidal stability and thus their circulation half - life in vivo . PEGylation can be accomplished merely through the incubating PEG lipid derivatives and cell membrane at 37 °C . PEG lipid tails easily insert into membrane lay - ers in these conditions . One issue with current PEGyla - tion methods for membrane vesicles is the lack of precise quantification . The outcome of PEGylation may be dependent on the compactness of PEG on the vesicles . As a next step , researchers should establish standard pro - cedures for PEGylation of the cell membrane . Cell membrane hybridization It is possible to create a hybrid cell membrane by fus - ing two parent cell membranes . These cell membranes have both parental cell membrane properties . Hybrid cell membranes can synergistically carry out complex behaviors . Several studies have used hybrid cell mem - branes to coat synthetic nanocarriers [ 101 , 102 ] . For example , RBC membrane - coated nanocarriers can avoid reticuloendothelial clearance because they express CD47 ( immunoregulatory marker ) [ 103 ] . Similarly , P - selectin is a ligand of the CD44 receptor found in platelet mem - branes , allowing it to be targeted at cancer cells [ 104 ] . These membranes can be used to coat nanocarriers to improve drug delivery efficiency . It was discovered that PLGA nanocarriers coated with RBC - platelet mem - brane have a longer blood circulation time and better binding to MDA - MB231 breast cancer cells than plain PLGA nanoparticles [ 103 ] . Another study used homo - typic targeting by fusing cancer cell membranes with RBC membranes [ 105 ] . The hybridized MCF7 - RBC membrane - coated nanocarriers were found to be highly effective in terms of photothermal effect and accumula - tion at tumor site in MCF7 tumor - bearing mice . This study established that the protein proportion of dual membranes was a significant predictor of homotypic Fig . 3 Post - modification of cell membrane . Cell membranes can be modified with different molecules or biomarkers to modulate their biological behaviors . An illustration of aptamers ( A ) , protein ( B ) , cholesterol ( C ) , and synthetic polymer ( D ) conjugated cell membrane Page 10 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 impact and blood retention . To achieve the best perfor - mance , the ideal proportion of the two membranes must be found empirically . Not only may hybrid membranes be formed by fusing two cell membranes together , but they can also be formed by fusing a cell membrane and a lipo - some together . Pitchaimani et al . reported a nanocarrier coated with a hybridized membrane of the natural killer cell membranes and liposomes [ 106 ] . The hybridization of liposome membranes in this approach enables the incorporation of several lipid components of liposomes into the cell membrane . Pure cell membrane used in nanocarrier coating Red blood cells RBCs have attracted considerable interest as a biomate - rial for nanocarriers coating [ 83 ] . In humans , RBCs have a short lifespan of up to 120 days . This short - lived property of RBCs makes them an excellent source of membrane for coating nanocarriers . RBCs have a significant role in the removal of pathogens from the body via oxycytosis dur - ing the transportation of oxygen [ 107 ] . RBCs also express the ‘don’t eat me’ marker CD47 , which binds to the macrophage - expressed signal - regulatory protein α pre - venting it from being taken up [ 108 ] . Therefore , the use of an RBC membrane to coat the nanocarrier improves the detoxification process , the removal of pathogens , and long - term circulation . Because of these properties , the RBC membrane can be used for coating a variety of nanocarriers to deliver drugs targeting breast cancer and colon cancer [ 108 – 111 ] . However , RBC membrane can also be functionalized with iRGD peptide and folate receptor to target breast cancer [ 112 , 113 ] . For targeting the brain , targeting ligands such as T7 , cRGD peptide , D CDX peptide , and NGR peptide are incorporated into the RBC membrane [ 97 , 114 , 115 ] . Coating nanocarriers taking in anticancer drugs , photodynamic or photother - mal agents with RBC membranes can be used to address the problem of short blood retention time . Recently , a study reported melanin nanocarriers coated with RBC membrane for effective photothermal cancer therapy [ 116 ] . They observed that melanin nanocarriers coated with RBC membrane had higher photo thermal efficacy in vivo than bare melanin nanocarriers due to improved blood retention and tumor site accumulation . RBC mem - branes have also been coated on iron oxide nanomaterials capable of photothermal conversion [ 111 ] . The iron oxide clusters coated with RBC membrane retain their pho - tothermal properties while being less absorbed by mac - rophages . After intravenous injection , iron oxide clusters coated with RBC membrane showed less liver distribu - tion and more tumor accumulation in mice . Mesoporous nanocarriers encapsulating doxorubicin have also been coated with RBC membranes for photochemotherapy of cancer [ 117 ] . Plain mesoporous nanocarriers have a short half - life and nonspecific macrophage uptake . To fight against cancer , the RBC membrane coating decreases non - specific uptake and increases blood circulation time while combining phototherapeutic and chemotherapeu - tic effects ( Fig . 4 ) . Modification of RBC membranes with specific ligands can improve delivery to target tissues . For example , when RGDyK peptide was inserted into the RBC membrane used for coating of drug nanocrystals , they had a bet - ter distribution to tumors and antitumor efficacy than nanocrystals coated with unmodified RBC membrane or plain nanocrystals [ 97 ] . The CDX peptide derived from the neurotoxin was also used for the modification of RBC membranes to target brain tissues [ 115 ] . The CDX pep - tide was anchored to RBC membranes by streptavidin – biotin . In a glioma mouse model , CDX peptide added to RBC membranes increased brain delivery . Zhou et al . chemically rooted hyaluronidase onto the surface of RBC membranes via bifunctional linker succinimidyl - [ ( N - maleimidopropionamido ) - polyethyleneglycol ] ester to improve tissue penetration [ 96 ] . The modification of RBC membranes did not affect their pharmacokinetics and hyaluronidase also showed its activity as usual . White blood cells White blood cells ( WBCs ) are colorless , nucleated spher - ical blood cells that influence disease progression . Nano - carriers surface engineered with a WBC membrane have been widely used as anticancer drug carriers in recent years due to their immune escape and active targeting abilities [ 118 ] . The most used WBCs for surface engineer - ing of nanocarriers are neutrophils and macrophages . Neutrophils are the first immune cells to respond to tumours or infection and are closely linked to tumor pro - gression , making them ideal carriers of antitumor drugs . They are activated by chemokines or cytokines like inter - feron - gamma , interleukin 8 , granulocyte – macrophage colony - stimulating factor , and tumour necrosis factor α which direct them to the inflammation or infection site [ 119 ] . It has been shown that conformational variations in integrins such as L - selectin , P - selectin , macrophage - 1 antigen , LFA - 1 , and VLA - 4 also support neutrophil mobilization via extravasation from blood vessels [ 120 ] . Therefore , the neutrophil membrane can be used for sur - face engineering of nanocarriers to target breast cancer , circulating tumour cells , lung cancer , and premetastatic niches [ 25 , 50 , 121 ] . Zhao et al . reported a biomimetic nanocarrier ( PTX - CL / NEs ) prepared by coating PTX - loaded liposomes with neutrophil membranes [ 122 ] . PTX - CL / NEs successfully target tumor sites , release drugs , and inhibit tumor growth and recurrence . Cao et al . surface engineered Celastrol - loaded PEG - PLGA Page 11 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 Fig . 4 a Curves of tumor volume in A549 tumor - bearing mice treated with various agents . b Curves of body weight of mice in each group . c Images of tumors dissected on the 13th day following photothermal treatment , as well as a comparison of each group’s tumor weight . d Hematoxylin and eosin staining images of major organs and tumor tissues dissected on the 13th day following photothermal treatment . Reproduced with permission from [ 116 ] Page 12 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 nanocarriers with neutrophil membranes [ 123 ] . Coating with neutrophil membranes allowed nanocarriers to pick up by chemokines , pass through the blood - pancreas bar - rier , and reach the tumor site . Although neutrophil mem - branes are rich in targeting content and fast to pick up by chemokines , they are preferred to use in acute treat - ment situations [ 124 ] . In the case of allogeneic blood as a source of WBC membranes , infectious disease screen - ing and blood type compatibility are required because the WBCs are extremely diverse [ 125 ] ( Fig . 5 ) . Macrophages are classified as M1 or M2 depending on their activation state . M2 macrophages reduce inflamma - tion , suppress the immune system , and promote tumour growth , whereas M1 macrophages cause inflammation , stimulate the immune system , and extinguish tumour tis - sue [ 126 ] . M1 macrophages’ antitumor effect is derived from surface markers like CD86 , CD80 , and MHC - II . Therefore , macrophage membrane - coated nanocarriers have been widely employed for developing antitumour nanocarriers targeting breast cancer and lung metas - tasis of breast cancer [ 22 , 35 , 127 ] . The microenviron - ment of cancer affects macrophages , so their antitumor effect is often enhanced by administrating macrophages with other therapies . Hu et al . synthesized biomimetic nanocarriers [ ( C / I ) BP @ B - A ( D ) & M1m ] that were encap - sulated in the M1 macrophage membrane [ 128 ] . Numer - ous molecules involved in over expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) and costimulatory signal transduction on the cell membrane enabled ( C / I ) BP @ B - A ( D ) & M1m to target cancer tissues effectively . When combined with laser irradiation , ( C / I ) BP @ B - A ( D ) & M1m efficiently released drugs at the site of appli - cation . Liu et al . synthesized a mixed micelle containing bilirubin ( ROX - responsive ) and chlorin e6 ( photosen - sitizer ) , loaded with paclitaxel dimer , and wrapped into a macrophage membrane . By co - delivering paclitaxel dimer and Ce6 , these nanocarriers effectively combine photodynamic and chemotherapy therapy . Macrophage membranes can shield drugs from being taken up by macrophages , which increases the likelihood of nanocar - riers being absorbed and retained by tumor cells . Platelet Platelets are nucleate cells of blood produced by mega - karyocyte fragmentation and are involved in tumor metastasis , thrombosis , and blood coagulation [ 129 ] . Platelet membranes have the ability to escape phago - cytosis in systemic circulation . Like RBCs , the platelet membrane has CD47 receptors . CD47 receptors interact with regulatory proteins that inhibit macrophage recep - tors and can affect the pharmacokinetics of encapsu - lated drugs . Platelet glycoproteins may also interact with collagen - rich plaque [ 130 ] , assisting in the targeting of atherosclerotic sites by platelet membrane - coated nano - carriers . So , platelet membrane coating enables nanocar - riers to escape from macrophages and selectively bind injured vessels and tumour tissues . Because of these properties , platelet membrane coated nanocarriers can be used to target breast cancer lung metastasis and cir - culating tumour cells [ 57 , 75 ] . When using nanocarriers coated with platelet membranes , it is suggested to focus on CD47 receptor integrity . A functional change in the CD47 receptor may affect biodistribution and pharma - cokinetics of nanocarriers . Nanocarriers coated with platelet membranes should not be used in patients with autoimmune diseases . Platelet autoantibodies may form immune complexes with nanocarriers [ 131 ] . In recent years , the number of platelet membrane coated drug delivery systems has increased rapidly due to their easy extraction , purification , and accumulation at cancer sites [ 132 ] . Rong et al . reported a nanocarrier of platelet membrane coated black phosphorus quantum dots carrying hederagenin ( PLT @ BPQDsHED ) [ 133 ] . PLT @ BPQDs - HED had a stronger fluorescence signal at the cancer site and a higher retention rate than the con - trol group after 48 h . A higher efficiency of drug deliv - ery is achieved by PLT @ BPQDs - HED because selectin on the platelet membrane specifically attaches to the CD44 receptor overexpressed in cancer tissue . Platelets are much more related to cancer cells , and the nanocar - riers that are wrapped into platelet membranes avoid clearance by the immune system and specifically target cancer tissue via the proteins on the membrane surface . Platelet membrane - coated drug delivery systems have the potential to be used in combination with immunotherapy and phototherapy . Wu et al . wrapped nanocarriers com - prising the anticancer drug and polypyrrole into platelet membranes [ 134 ] . Platelet membrane enables the drug delivery system to escape from immune systems and tar - get the cancer tissue , laser irradiation triggers polypyr - role to cause hyperthermia and ablate the cancer cells , and anticancer drugs are also discharged from the nano - carriers to destroy the cancer tissue . Cancer cell Cancer is described as abnormal cell growth that could lead to metastasis . Cancerous cells’ membrane display a variety of tumour - specific adhesion and antigen moieties . There are a wide range of molecules involved in cell – cell and cell – matrix adhesion , such as mucoprotein - 1 , epi - thelial adhesion moieties , lymphocyte - homing recep - tors , galectin - 3 , integrins , and cadherins [ 36 , 135 , 136 ] . Cancer cells possess properties that collectively serve a self - protective function , such as homotypic cell adhesion and immune system evasion [ 137 ] . Since these cells have unique characteristics , their membranes have gained Page 13 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 Fig . 5 Antitumor efficacy of neutrophil membrane - coated nanocarriers in mice .

Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 popularity as coating stuff for nanocarriers . The dis - persed membrane of cancer cells on nanocarriers allows various characteristics of cancer cells to be introduced to the nanocarriers for targeting homotypic tumours and developing personalized cancer therapy [ 66 , 138 ] . Metal oxide nanoparticles , gelatin particles , mesoporous silica , and PLGA nanocarriers have all been wrapped into can - cer cell membranes and used to deliver anticancer drugs [ 24 , 72 , 139 , 140 ] . Membranes of cancer cells have the feature of homolo - gous targeting that can be used for targeting homologous toumors [ 24 ] . In this respect , iron oxide nanocarriers were coated with HeLa cell and UM - SCC - 7 membranes . When these coated nanocarriers were allowed to incu - bate with HeLa , HepG2 , UM - SCC - 7 , and COS7 cells . The coated nanocarriers showed a high affinity towards HeLa cells and UM - SCC - 7 cells . They could also self - target a homologous tumor and effectively restrain tumor growth in vivo . Some studies also reported the blood – brain bar - rier crossing ability of cancer cell membranes [ 141 , 142 ] . For example , nanoparticles of polycaprolactone / F68 were coated with secondary brain cancer cell membranes and then loaded with indocyanine green , a photothermal and imaging agent [ 141 ] . Intravenous injection of these nanocarriers into mice bearing U87MG - Luc glioma cells showed high distribution in the brain . Similarly , PEG - PLGA nanocarriers coated with MDA - MB - 831 cancer cell membrane were investigated for use in treating brain cancer [ 142 ] . They found that the accumulation of coated nanocarriers in the brain was higher than uncoated nanocarriers . T cells T cells play an important role in adaptive immune responses [ 143 ] . T cells need antigen priming through a specific T - cell receptor ( TCR ) for activation . The den - dritic cells ( DCs ) possess the MHC - antigen complex that engages with the TCR and activates T cells . Acti - vated naive T cells become regulatory or effector T cells , depending on the DC - T cell immune synapse context . Effector T cells scavenge and kill cancerous or virus - infected cells in the bloodstream . Moreover , T cells can also mature into memory T cells , which offer long - lasting protection against foreign bodies that activated them . Therefore , T cell membranes coated nanocarriers can be used to target gastric cancer , liver cancer , and tumour tis - sues [ 85 , 92 , 144 ] . T cell membranes were used to wrap PLGA nanocar - riers loaded with dacarbazine [ 145 ] . In this study , T cell membranes were extracted from the EL4 cell line and incubated with PLGA nanocarriers loaded with dacar - bazine . T cell membrane - coated nanocarriers were able to bypass tumor immune suppression and neutralize TGF - b1 and PD - ligand 1 expression in the tumor envi - ronment . Furthermore , T cell membrane - coated nano - carriers improved dacarbazine delivery and enhanced apoptosis of tumor cells . Ma et al . reported the devel - opment of a nanocarrier composed of mesoporous silica holding IR780 nanoparticles wrapped into the membranes of chimeric antigen receptor T cells ( CAR - T ) to exclusively target hepatocellular carcinoma cells ( HCCs ) expressing GPC3 [ 85 ] . They engineered the CAR - T cell nanocarrier in such a way that it could detect GPC3 - expressing HCCs . The results demonstrated that NP - coated CAR - T cell membranes were more effective at targeting HCC cells in vivo and in vitro than IR780 - loaded mesoporous silica . CAR - T cell therapy is a newer blood cancer treatment . Ex vivo CAR - T cells are pro - duced by genetically modifying TCR to recognize an antigen without antigen presentation . Ex vivo - amplifier CAR - T cells are then reinfused into hematological can - cer patients . The FDA has approved CAR - T cell targeting of the CD19 antigen for the treatment of relapsed / refrac - tory diffuse large B - cell lymphoma or acute lymphoblas - tic leukemia . Dendritic cells Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are immune cells that gather around cancer cells due to immune signals ( such as path - ogen - associated molecular patterns and proinflamma - tory cytokines ) . They transfer tumor - associated antigens to lymph nodes to establish communication with naive T cells for differentiation into attack cancer cells and mature T cells [ 146 ] . For this reason , designing tumor immunotherapy around DCs characteristics is a prom - ising approach . However , issues like complex prepara - tion methods , short efficacy periods , and high cost still need to be addressed [ 147 ] . DC membranes contain components like DC - originating molecules and can tar - get and stimulate the immune systems of their source cells [ 148 ] . It has been shown that CD40 / CD80 / CD83 / CD86 are upregulated on the DC membranes as co - stim - ulatory receptors [ 149 ] . The binding of these molecules to their respective receptors on T - cells activates DCs to produce cytokines such as IL - 10 , IL - 12 , and interleukin that distinguish T cells into their anti - inflammatory or pro - inflammatory subsets . Therefore , DC membranes coated nanocarriers can be used to target prostate can - cer and ovarian cancer [ 150 , 151 ] . Cheng et al . reported an IL - 2 - loaded PLGA nanocarrier warped in membranes derived from DCs [ 151 ] . The DCs derived membranes provide unique and potent stimulatory signals and sus - tain a strong T - cell response due to their intact surface proteins . The nano - dimensions of this carrier may be a significant contributor to the T cell response by elimi - nating spatial barriers throughout antigen presentation . Page 15 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 Zhang et al . used a combination of a nanocarrier - based antigen delivery system and photochemical internaliza - tion to induce tumor - specific cytotoxic T cells in their study [ 152 ] . It was demonstrated that the combination of a hydrophobic photosensitizer ( Pheophorbide A ) and polyethyleneimine possessed the ability to evade endoso - mal degradation while also enabling near - infrared imag - ing . Moreover , by grafting the synthesized complex onto ovalbumin , a model antigen , light - sensitive nanocarriers were formed . Hybrid membrane used in nanocarrier coating Hybrid membranes can be used to combine the prop - erties of a variety of cell membranes and optimize their function [ 101 ] . In general , hybrid membrane coated nanocarriers ( HMCNs ) more specifically interact with the cancer environment , resulting in improved specific targeting , minimizing non - specific interactions with abundant proteins and cellular components , and opti - mizing specific biological roles [ 153 ] . Moreover , a hybrid membrane incorporates at least two distinct biological activities . One is a competence for targeting , whereas the other refers to inherent properties conferred by the membranes of a source cell . The targeting potential is primarily comprised of homologous targeted delivery to tumor sites via DC membranes and cancer cell mem - branes , specific tumor targeting via PLT membranes , the capability of tumor targeting enhancement via mem - branes of stem cells , and circulating tumor cells target - ing via WBC and PLT membranes [ 75 , 154 – 156 ] . The latter biological function types mainly include prolonga - tion of blood circulation via PLT and RBC membranes ; specific adherence to injured vessels via PLT membranes ; immune evasion via PLT and WBC membranes ; toxin neutralization and absorption via RBC and macrophage membranes ; and activation of the immune system via bacterial outer membranes , cancer cell membranes and immune cell membranes . Due to the membrane combi - nation , HMCNs can achieve maximum functionality in diverse biomedical fields . The leukocyte membrane is considered a naturally occurring coating material with the biomimetic potential , capable of evading immune system capture and inflam - matory targeting via inducing inflammation via special - ized ligand - receptor interaction [ 121 ] . Vectors that are similar to leukocytes could continue their capabilities , such as inhibiting particle phagocytosis and opsoniza - tion , facilitating the transportation over the endothelial layer while avoiding the lysosomal pathway and thereby delaying the clearance by the liver [ 27 ] . However , a drug delivery system based on a single leukocyte membrane is incapable of achieving adequate therapeutic efficiency because of its incapability towards tumor targeting . Thus , He et al . joined a leukocyte membrane with a cancer cell membrane to increase the targeting potential of HMCNs . The leutusome was produced by fusing together the membranes of leukocytes , tumor cells , and liposomal nanocarriers simultaneously [ 157 ] . Encapsulation of paclitaxel ( PTX ) with leutusomes significantly reduced tumor development without causing systemic damage ( in vivo ) , suggesting that selective taken up of leutusomes by tumor cells . After 48 h , leutusomes labeled with DIR displayed substantial fluorescence in tumor sites that were 9 . 3 - fold larger than those in the control . The lipo - somal NPs accumulation from leukocytes or cancer cells was 2 . 7 - fold and 4 . 4 - fold more in the tumor , respectively , than in the control . Additionally , the study indicated that coating outside of the cores or incorporation into liposomal nanocarriers had no effect on the unique fea - tures of different cell membranes . These composite bio - mimetic nanocarriers outperform solid tumour homing and have a longer circulation time due to surface markers expressed on both cell types . Sun et al . developed a cancer cell - RBC hybrid mem - brane coated gold nanocage loaded with doxorubicin to treat breast cancer via chemotherapy , photothermal therapy , and radiotherapy [ 158 ] . Homological targeting of the cancer cell membrane and reduced clearance by the RBC membrane made the HMCNs particularly effec - tive in accumulating in tumor sites . Macrophages have been associated with the early dispersion of cancer and hence have a substantial effect on prolonging metastasis throughout the progression of cancer . Gong et al . devel - oped a hybrid membrane composed of macrophages and cancer cells coated with doxorubicin - loaded PLGA nano - carriers for use in breast cancer treatment to specifically target lung metastases [ 159 ] . Since RAW264 . 7 membrane exhibits enhanced expression of high integrin α4β1 , the resultant HMCNs demonstrate remarkable membrane - derived features , which include the capacity to target homologous cancer cells and improved particular meta - static targeting potential . The metastatic nodule numbers in the lung were reduced by about 88 . 9 % after the therapy of lung metastases derived from breast cancer , which performed better than the pure CMCNs . This hybrid membrane derived platform demonstrates promise as a biomimetic nanoplatform for the metastasis treatment of breast cancer . He and Su’s group previously described the use of HMCNs based on RBC and retinal endotheliocyte mem - branes for non - invasive therapy of choroidal neovas - cularization [ 160 ] . The RBC and retinal endotheliocyte membranes fusion provide protection to the nanocar - rier against phagocytosis while also giving the potential to the HMCNs to bind with vascular endothelial growth factors , enhancing their potential to target choroidal Page 16 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 neovascularization regions actively . particularly , the anti - VE - cadherin antibody suppressed the fluorescent signals in HMCNs - treated cells , demonstrating that the ability of self - targeting is dependent on surface binding molecules ( N - and VE - cadherin ) expression on the retinal endo - theliocyte membrane [ 161 ] . The substantial fluorescence colocalization of angiogenic retinal endotheliocyte mem - branes and HMCNs in the tube formation experiment also indicated the nanocarriers’ targeting ability . Fur - thermore , using a quantitative examination of the mean fluorescence intensity , the group treated with HMCNs drastically decreased damage area and choroidal neovas - cularization leakage in contrast to the group treated with pure CMCNs in a choroidal neovascularization mouse model induced by laser . In conclusion , dual - fused mem - brane - based nanocarriers offer significant advantages over currently available invasive therapies . Challenges and future directions Numerous advantages have been reported for CMCNs , particularly in terms of biocompatibility and targeting . Synthetic DDSs currently available are basically foreign substances with the potential for immunogenicity and toxicity . Whereas cell membranes are endogenous , they are considered biocompatible and perform a variety of biological functions like the source cell . However , cer - tain issues must be resolved before these carriers can continue to evolve and move from the laboratory to the clinic . The first and most important question to be addressed is about the yield of cell membranes and extracellu - lar vesicles . Not only do existing separation technolo - gies produce a negligible amount of cell membranes and extracellular vesicles , but they are also prohibitively expensive for large - scale production . As a result , more sophisticated large - scale manufacturing methods are required to continue expanding the application of cell membrane . In recent years , to address the yield issue , extensive work has been carried out on techniques which are used for generating artificial vesicles when the membrane is ruptured via extrusion . For example , the same number of THP - 1 cells yield more than twice as many simulated exosomes as natural exosomes , and the drug encapsulating and releasing rates of the simu - lated exosomes are also higher [ 162 ] . The extraction and purification procedures must also be revised and optimized , as many cells must still be cultured to obtain an adequate number of membranes , and the prepara - tion procedure must still be simplified [ 118 ] . For RBCs membrane - coated nanocarriers that lack a targeting abil - ity , the membranes must be modified to reach the tar - get site for therapeutic cargo release , but this will likely change the membrane’s original structure and reduce its biocompatibility . Platelet membranes are highly sensi - tive , so finding an appropriate loading scheme to ensure adequate drug loading and reliable delivery to the target tissue is challenging . The toxicity and stability of modi - fied membranes must also be studied , especially as nano - carriers for cancer therapy . To achieve the desired dose and release profile , the drug loading method should be chosen carefully [ 163 ] . Moreover , a complete understanding of the mecha - nism of transporting cell membranes extracted from dif - ferent sources in vivo is unknown and requires further research . For example , therapeutic molecules delivered by white cell membrane carriers may activate immune system components and cause inflammation [ 164 ] . When cancer cell membrane is used , it may cause cancer in the body if the parent cancer cells’ genetic material is not completely removed . Procedures for purifying and char - acterizing cell membranes are not consistent and differ from laboratory to laboratory , causing confusion about the physicochemical features of the cell membrane . So , it is necessary to share the scientific data and develop a standardized procedure for cell membrane quality con - trol that is highly repeatable . Nanocarriers wrapped into cell membranes and extracellular vesicles can target can - cer tissues crossing biological barriers . Some cells can be used to both extract membranes and isolate extracellular vesicles to transport drugs . While it is relatively simple to extract and prepare the cell membrane , the targeting ability may be compromised due to protein loss during membrane extraction . However , extracellular vesicles are difficult to prepare , they generally retain all mem - brane components , giving them excellent targeting ability [ 165 ] . As a result , the appropriate carrier must be chosen according to the experiment’s objective in order to maxi - mize the therapeutic effect . Conclusions The development of therapeutics derived from cell membrane material is a rapidly growing field of research that is particularly appealing because it involves an organic cellular networking system . Biomi - metic technology has the advantage of taking advan - tage of the natural mechanisms of living matter , but it is also a double - edged sword . It is difficult to know which components , out of the multiple factors , confer membrane functionality , and so the ratio of each com - ponent needs to be modified as needed . To develop drug - containing membrane - coated carriers , a simi - larly and standardized manufacturing process will be required . Despite the difficulties associated with pro - cessing variables , manufacturing , and quality control , vesicles derived from natural cells have the advantage of being bioactive , reflecting the features of the parent Page 17 of 21 Lei et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 45 cells . Although membrane - coated nanocarriers face numerous challenges , a powerful advantage of ‘mimick - ing nature’ overrides many disadvantages of traditional DDSs and offers a more efficient approach for cancer treatment . With the rapid advancement of nanotech - nology , proteomics , bioinformatics , pharmacology , and material science , it is expected that the combination of DDSs and cells will overcome numerous obstacles , revolutionize current medical technology , and open up new avenues for targeted cancer therapy .
