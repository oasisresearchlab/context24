To study clathrin self - assembly , we expressed the C - terminal third of the clathrin heavy chain in bacteria . The recombinant fragment trimerized , bound clathrin light chains , and morphologically resembled the hub domain of the tri - skelion - shaped clathrin molecule . Self - assembly of re - combinant hubs demonstrated a regulatory role for clathrin light chains and for the distal portions of tri - skelion legs in clathrin coat formation . Deletion muta - genesis of the hub localized a domain mediating light chain binding and clathrin self - assembly and mapped a transferable trimerization domain . These studies de - fine molecular interactions controlling clathrin self - assembly and establish a recombinant system for fu - ture analysis . Introduction Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) are responsible for selec - tive removal of integral membrane proteins from one cellu - lar membrane and thereby facilitate their targeting to an - other ( reviewed by Brodsky , 1988 ; Pley and Parham , 1993 ) . At the plasma membrane , this results in receptor - mediated endocytosis , in which selected receptors are concentrated in CCVs and delivered to endosomes . In the mans - Golgi network , CCVs mediate membrane sorting in - volved in biogenesis of lysosomes and secretory granules . The receptor sorting function is a direct consequence of physical properties of the clathrin coat , which polymerizes into a regular polyhedral lattice on the cytoplasmic face of membranes from which CCVs bud . The ability of recep - tors to be trapped by the membrane - associated clathrin lattice , through a recognized signal in their cytoplasmic domain , results in their selective concentration . Recogni - tion of the sorted receptors is attributed to adaptor mole - cules that interact with their cytoplasmic domains and initi - ate clathrin assembly within the cell ( Keen , 1990 ; Pearse and Robinson , 1990 ) . However , the concentration function is strictly a result of clathrin polymerization into a lattice that organizes the associated elements . Therefore , under - standing the molecular basis for clathrin self - assembly is fundamental to understanding how receptor - mediated en - docytosis works . In addition , it may shed light on pro - cesses that control other protein self - assembly reactions , such as the formation of virus particles and the polymeriza - tion of filamentous components of the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix . It has been difficult to dissect the structural basis of clathrin self - assembly because of the large size of clathrin molecules and the heterogeneity of the light chain sub - units . A single clathrin molecule has a triskelion shape and is composed of three 192 kDa heavy chains , each bound to a light chain of 25 - 29 kDa ( reviewed by Pley and Parham [ 1993 ] ) . In mammalian cells the two types of light chain , light chain a ( LCa ) and light chain b ( LCb ) , are expressed in different relative levels in different tissues ( Acton and Brodsky , 1990 ) and are randomly distributed on clathrin triskelions ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1983 ) resulting in four types of clathrin triskelion with different light chain compositions ( 3LCa , 2LCa - 1 LCb , 2LCb - 1 LCa , 3LCb ) . In addition , neuronal cells express splicing variants of both LCa and LCb ( Stamm et al . , 1992 ; Wong et al . , 1990 ) . Previous studies from this laboratory and others have gen - erated a low resolution model for the disposition of func - tional domains on the triskelion structure based on the properties of proteolytic fragments , mutant yeast clathrin , and the binding of anti - clathrin antibodies ( Nathke et al . , 1992 ; Kirchhausen and Harrison , 1984 ; Ungewickell , 1983 ; Lemmon et al . , 1991 ) . The model suggests that the C - terminal third ( residues 1074 - 1675 ) of three clathrin heavy chains form the hub of the triskelion comprising the vertex and the proximal segment of the leg , extending to the bend . The hub region contains major structural sites involved in clathrin function , including domains responsi - ble for trimerization of the clathrin heavy chain , binding of the light chain subunits , and assembly of the clathrin lattice . To study the clathrin functions ascribed to the triskelion hub , we produced it by expression in bacteria , both as a heavy chain fragment and coexpressed with neuronal LCb . The work described below establishes that the re - combinant hub folds into a trimeric structure , binds light chains , and can self - assemble , essentially reproducing major functions of the whole clathrin triskelion and demon - strating that these can be independently mediated by the hub fragment . Coexpression of the hub with LCb pre - vented hub assembly at physiological pH , defining a new function for the light chains in making clathrin assembly adaptor dependent within the cell . Morphology of the as - sembled hub revealed that the distal portions of the triskel - Cell 258 ion legs control directionality and curvature of the clathrin lattice . In addition , the hub sequences involved in light chain binding and clathrin self - assembly were localized by deletion mutagenesis , and the sequence mediating tri - merization was mapped and shown to function indepen - dently . This work identifies and maps a number of molecu - lar features of the clathrin triskelion that control clathrin self - assembly and establishes a recombinant system that makes further mutagenesis and crystallization studies possible . Results Bacterially Expressed Triskelion Hubs Trimerize and Bind Light Chains The hub of the clathrin triskelion was defined previously as extending from residue 1074 to the C - terminus of the heavy chain ( residue 1675 ) based on dominant cleavage sites for trypsin and chymotrypsin at residues 1074 and 1073 , respectively ( Nathke et al . , 1992 ) , suggesting the limit of a stably folded domain . As most structural informa - tion was available for the bovine clathrin protein , this was the species of choice to attempt expression of the hub fragment . It was therefore necessary to isolate and deter - mine the sequence of cDNA encoding the bovine clathrin heavy chain . This was achieved by isolation of partial cDNA clones from bovine retina ( Nathans and Hogness , 1983 ) and bovine lymphocyte ( Ennis et al . , 1988 ) libraries and by cloning intervening and flanking sequences from bovine epithelial cell RNA using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . The translated bo - vine clathrin heavy chain sequence ( 1675 residues ) was 99 . 7 % identical to that determined for rat clathrin ( five residues different ) and 99 . 9 % identical to human ( one resi - due different ) . Specific residues of difference are listed in Table 1 , which compares clathrin heavy chains from all species that have been analyzed . From the isolated cDNAs , nucleotides encoding heavy chain residues 1074 - l 675 were cloned into the pET15b ex - pression vector , providing a polyhistidine tag at the N - ter - minus of the fragment . Following expression in Esche - richia coli , the hub fragment was purified by sequential chromatography using Ni2 + affinity resin and size exclu - sion , yielding approximately 10 mg of expressed protein per liter of bacterial culture . The purified hub formed a trimer of 68 kDa fragments , as indicated by its comigration with catalase ( 232 kDa ) on a size exclusion column ( Figure 1 ) and by cross - linking experiments ( data not shown ) . The electrophoretic behavior of the hub fragment was consis - tent with its molecular mass as calculated from the pro - tein sequence , indicating that sequences causing aber - rant electrophoretic migration of the rat clathrin heavy chain ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1987a ) were absent from this fragment . To determine whether the heavy chain hub fragment could associate with clathrin light chains during synthesis in bacteria , we cloned cDNA encoding neuronal bovine LCb ( Jackson et al . , 1987 ) into the pET15b plasmid , in tandem with the hub fragment , to be expressed from the same promoter . Coexpressed LCb associated with the tri - merized hub and comigrated on a size exclusion column ( Figures 1 B - l D ) . The stoichiometry of the hub - LCb com - plex formed by coexpression was determined following purification using Ni * + affinity resin to bind the polyhistidine tag on the heavy chain fragment . For two separate hub preparations , the molar ratio of LCb to heavy chain frag - ment was found to be 1 : 3 and 3 : 4 , indicating that the light chain - binding sites were not fully occupied during coex - pression or that hubs may lose associated LCb during purification . It was possible to saturate the light chain - binding sites of the hub - LCb complexes by adding an excess of purified LCb following complex purification ( data not shown ) . The trimeric nature of the hub coexpressed with LCb was confirmed by electron microscopy ( Figure 2 ) . Plati - num shadowing revealed a morphology with linear dimen - sions similar to the center of a clathrin triskelion . The legs of the hubs were apparently thinner than the legs of a whole triskelion , which could be a function of the angle at which these molecules sit on the mica surface used for Table 1 .

Bacterially Expressed Clathrin Hub Fragments Trimerize and Bind Light Chain ( A ) Recombinant bovine clathrin hub fragment ( residues 1074 - 1675 ) was expressed and purified by Ni2 + affinity chromatography . Purified protein ( 500 ug ) was subjected to size exclusion chromatography ( Su - perose 6 , 2 . 6 x 70 cm ) . Column fractions ( numbered across the top ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . The relative elution positions of the void volume ( V , ) and marker proteins used for column calibration ( catalase , 232 kDa and BSA , 67 kDa ) are indicated . Shown at the left is the migration position of BSA , the 67 kDa SDS - PAGE marker protein . ( B ) Recombinant bovine clathrin hub fragment was coexpressed with neuronal LCb , driven off the same promoter . Bacterial lysate was frac - tionated by size exclusion chromatography and analyzed by SDS - PAGE , as in ( A ) . The upper arrowhead indicates the position of the hub fragments , and the lower arrowhead indicates the position of LCb . The LCb peak at fraction 13 is hub bound . Evidently because some of the hub fragment is insoluble and perhaps misfolded , there is an excess of free LCb in the lysate , peaking at fraction 17 . Shown at the left are the migration positions of the SDS - PAGE marker proteins . ( C ) Bacterial lysate of coexpressed hub with LCb , analyzed as in ( B ) , with LCb detected by immunoblotting with MAb CON . 1 , further demon - strating the two LCb peaks . ( D ) Bacterial lysate containing LCb expressed in the absence of hub fragments was boiled to produce partially purified LCb . The heat - resistant supernatant was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography and immunoblotting as in ( C ) , confirming that the LCb in fraction 17 represents dissociated LCb . shadowing . If the hubs lie flatter than the whole triskelion , which is not planar ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1986 ; Nathke et al . , 1992 ) , they would accumulate less platinum and appear to be thinner . The hub expressed in the absence of LCb also had a trimeric structure visible in electron micrographs of negatively stained samples ( data not shown ) . Circular dichroism ( CD ) was used for independent as - sessment of how the hub fragments , expressed either with or without LCb , were folding relative to the intact clathrin triskelion . The spectra obtained ( data not shown ) for all three molecules ( hub , hub - LCb , and bovine brain triskeli - ons ) were very similar to those previously reported for puri - fied clathrin ( Winkler and Stanley , 1983 ) . This suggested that the hubs fold similarly to their conformation in the whole triskelion and that the presence of light chains does not significantly change the overall secondary structure . Figure 2 . Ultrastructural Analysis of Purified Recombinant Clathrin Hub Fragments ( A ) Purified recombinant clathrin hub fragments coexpressed with LCb were shadowed with platinum and analyzed by electron microscopy . The micrograph shown represents a typical field , photographed at 43 , 000 x Bar is 50 nm . ( B ) Gallery of single images of platinum - shadowed recombinant hub fragments coexpressed with LCb ( rows 1 and 3 ) or clathrin triskelions purified from bovine brain - coated vesicles ( rows 2 and 4 ) . Images of both hubs and triskelions were photographed at 43 , 000x and en - larged to the same magnification , so the dimensions are directly com - parable . Note that the morphology of each hub approximates the mor - phology and size of the hub region of the whole triskelion directly below it , but the legs appear thinner . Bar is 50 nm for all four rows . Self - Assembly of Hub Fragments with or without Light Chains Every edge of an assembled clathrin lattice comprises two anti - parallel proximal leg segments and two anti - parallel distal leg segments , since every vertex is occupied by the vertex of a clathrin triskelion ( Pearse and Crowther , 1987 ) . This arrangement suggested that the hub fragments might Cell 260 be able to self - assemble into a lattice - like structure formed by interaction of proximal leg segments alone . Further - more , the hub contains a domain involved in clathrin as - sembly ( between residues 1438 and 1481 ) recognized by monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) Xl 9 and X35 , the Fab frag - ments of which inhibit clathrin polymerization ( Blank and Brodsky , 1986 ) . Self - assembly of purified clathrin into polyhedral lattices occurs below pH 6 . 5 and can be re - versed by raising the pH . The rate and extent of theclathrin assembly reaction are enhanced by the presence of cal - cium ( Ungewickell and Ungewickell , 1991 ) , and assembly is easily detected spectrophotometrically ( Blank and Brod - sky , 1986 ) by an increase in light scatter at 320 nm ( Figure 3A ) . Lowering the pH of purified hubs coexpressed with LCb produced an increase in light scatter , which was re - versible by raising the pH , with reaction kinetics that are very similar to those of purified clathrin . The assembly of hubs coexpressed with LCb was also enhanced in the presence of calcium , although to a lesser extent than puri - fied clathrin . Assembly of hubs without light chains was insensitive to the presence of calcium . This correlates with previous observations that light chains are the calcium - binding components of clathrin ( Mooibroek et al . , 1987 ) and re - duce the rate and extent of clathrin assembly unless cal - cium is present ( Ungewickell and Ungewickell , 1991 ) , thereby suggesting a regulatory role for clathrin light chains . This role for the light chains is further demon - strated here by the sensitivity of hub assembly to pH ( Fig - ure 38 ) . Hub fragments coexpressed with LCb have the same pH - dependent regulation of assembly as purified clathrin , with assembly occurring efficiently below pH 6 . 5 . Hubswithout light chains assemble readily at any pH lower than 7 . 2 ( Figure 38 ) . Thus , the presence of the light chains also functions to impede clathrin assembly at physiologi - cal pH , thereby making clathrin assembly in the cell depen - dent on nucleation by adaptor molecules . Note that in the assemblystudiesdescribed above ( Figure 3 ) , the hubfrag - ments coexpressed with LCb were supplemented with pu - rified LCb to ensure that all the light chain - binding sites were occupied . Assembled hub fragments were stained with uranyl ace - tate and examined by electron microscopy to determine the extent to which they form lattices ( Figure 4 ) . In multiple independent experiments , it was possible to observe flat lattices formed by assembled hubs , with or without LCb . The lattices observed had similar dimensions to those formed by assembled clathrin , but the number of edges of the polygons was more variable , and the lattices had considerably less curvature . Most of the structures ob - served in samples of assem bled hubs ( with or without LCb ) looked like lattices that had polymerized in three dimen - sions ( Figure 48 ) . The fact that these structures can be depolymerized , by increasing the ambient pH , indicates they are formed by regulatable interactions , similar to those that form flat lattices ; however , their polymerization was apparently nucleated in several directions . The highly variable appearance of the assembled hubs suggests that , while the hub fragments assemble with normal kinetics , A Brain Clathrin a 8 Hub + LCb Hub min 0 . 5 0 . 4 B 0 . 3 8 0 . 2 0 . 1 Brain Clathrin Hub + LCb Hub Figure 3 .

Interestingly , there were no obviousdifferences between the types of lattices formed by hubs with and without LCb , although the assembled structures formed in the absence of light chains were generally more extensive .

S , accounting for the increased optical density ( OD ) of the assembled sample , but the structures , where discernible , did not look significantly different from struc - tures assembled in the absence of calcium ( data not shown ) . Light Chain and Antibody Binding by the Clathrin Hub To map the residues involved in binding clathrin light chains , deletion mutants of the hub fragments were gener - ated and expressed in bacteria . All the fragments listed in Table 2 were isolated from the soluble fraction of E . coli lysate . These expressed fragments were bound to NP affinity resin and incubated with a mixture of LCa and LCb purified from bovine brain - coated vesicles . Light chain binding to the hub fragments was assessed bycosedimen - tation of the light chains with the affinity resin . This binding assay was performed for the mutants listed in Table 2 , and examples of the results are shown in Figure 5 . Both LCa and LCb bound to the hub fragments that retained light chain - binding sites . LCb bound preferen - tially to most fragments , reflecting its higher affinity for clathrin heavy chain ( Acton and Brodsky , 1990 ; Brodsky et al . , 1987 ) . Light chain binding to hub fragments was independent of the presence of the trimerization domain ( see below ) . The smallest hub fragment to which light chains bound extended from heavy chain residues 1213 1522 . This finding does not support a major role for resi - dues 1107 - l 185 of the clathrin heavy chain , which had been predicted by Kirchhausen et al . ( 1987a ) to be in - volved in light chain binding . Further deletion to 1313 on the N - terminal side and to 1513 on the C - terminal side eliminated light chain binding bythe hub fragments . These results indicate that a fairly extensive region ( between 200 and 300 residues ) contributes to light chain binding . MAbsX19 and X35 , which interact with light chain - bind - ing sites on the clathrin heavy chain and block clathrin assembly ( Blank and Brodsky , 1987 ) , showed similar , but not identical , binding to the expressed hub fragments as seen for clathrin light chains ( Table 2 ) . This pattern of antibody reactivity confirms the involvement of an ex - tended region of the heavy chain in creating the light chain - binding domain . It also reinforces the colocalization of a region involved in clathrin assembly with the light chain - binding region of the hub . MAb reactivity with the recombinant proteins correlated with previous proteolytic mapping of their epitopes ( Nathke et al . , 1992 ) , requiring residues 1406 - l 438 for Xl 9 binding and residues 1438 - 1481 for X35 binding . Binding to the recombinant proteins further implicated 1483 - 1493 in stabilizing the X35 epi - tope . MAb X22 , which binds 14 . 5 nm from the vertex of the triskelion , almost at the bend in the leg , was previously mapped by proteolysis to residues 1109 - 1438 . Reactivity with the recombinant proteins showed X22 did not bind to 1128 - 1522 , demonstrating a requirement for residues between 1109 and 1128 for X22 binding . This epitope lo - calization to the N - terminal end of the hub region corre - Cell 262 Table 2 .

A Transferable Trimerization Domain in the Clathrin Hub Deletion mutants of the hub were expressed in bacteria and purified from the soluble fraction of E . coli lysate using Ni * + affinity resin . The eluted hub fragments were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography to determine whether they were trimerized ( Figure 6 ; Table 2 ) . The hub fragment ( 1074 - 1675 , 68 kDa ) migrated as a trimer ( 204 kDa ) , with a peak at fraction 13 . Deletion from the C - terminus of the hub fragment revealed that the C - terminal limit of the tri - merization domain was between 1608 and 1615 . Frag - ment 1074 - l 615 comigrated with the hub , but fragment 1074 - l 608 trailed into the monomer region of the column , suggesting that it was slightly unstable as a trimer . Mono - meric fragments with C - termini shorter than or equal to 1074 - 1522 peaked at fraction 18 , adjacent to the 67 kDa marker , bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . Fragments 1074 - 1587 and 1074 - 1600 peaked at fraction 17 and trailed toward the trimer peak , indicating retention of some ten - dency to trimerize . This finding correlates with the obser - vation that a yeast mutant with clathrin heavy chain termi - nating at the equivalent of residue 1589 was viable , but had unstable clathrin trimers ( Lemmon et al . , 1991 ) . To determine the N - terminal limit of the trimerization domain , clathrin heavy chain residues 1521 - 1675 were expressed at the C - terminus of maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) , normally a 42 kDa monomer . Fusion proteins ( 60 kDa ) purified on an amylose affinity column were shown 43 - 43 - # lit _ 29 - 29 - Figure 5 .

Each fragment ( 10 ug ) was rebound to 20 ul of NP + affinity resin and then incubated with a mixture of bovine brain LCa and LCb . The affinity resin with bound proteins ( 8 ) was separated from unbound ( UB ) proteins , and both fractions were analyzed for the presence of light chains by SDS - PAGE , followed by immunoblotting with MAb CON . 1 , which reacts with both LCa and LCb , migrating as a doublet at 36 and 34 kDa , respectively .

Mapping the Trimerization Domain of the Triskelion Hub Fragment Recombinant hub fragments with a polyhistidine tag ( A - C ) or MBP fusion constructs ( D - G ) were expressed in bacteria , purified by affinity chromatography , and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on Superose 6 to determine their multimerization state . Column fraction numbers are indicated at the top , and arrows specify the relative posi - tions of sizing column marker proteins . Proteins in each fraction are resolved by SDS - PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining . The residues of bovine clathrin heavy chain in each recombinant pro - tein are indicated at the left . Migration positions for SDS - PAGE marker proteins are shown at the right . The doublet in ( 6 ) suggests some proteolysis has occurred that causes the smaller species to behave more like a monomer , while the doublet in ( D ) results from aberrant electrophoretic migration , which is observed occasionally when the C - terminal residues of the clathrin heavy chain are present . to be trimeric ( 180 kDa ) by size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 6 ) . Truncation of the clathrin heavy chain se - quence attached to MBP demonstrated that MBP with clathrin residues 1550 - 1675 was the shortest construct to migrate as a trimer . In conjunction with the hub deletion data , this result maps the trimerization domain between residues 1550 and 164 5 and shows that it functions inde - pendently of the light chain - binding region ( Figure 6 ; Table 2 ) . It is of interest to note that construct MBP - 1521 - 1589 uniquely displayed a tendency to form multimers larger than trimers , although its peak fraction was between the monomer and trimer positions ( Figure 6 ) . This result sug - gests that flanking residues may influence the valency of multimerization . Analysis of the 1521 - 1589 fragment by cross - linking indicated a dominant dimer fraction , as well as larger multimers ( cross - linking data not shown ) . Cross - linking either the 1074 - 1675 hub fragment or the MBP - 1533 - 1675 construct , both of which migrated as trimers on the sizing column , yielded bands corresponding to tri - mers as the largest form of multimer detectable . Discussion Heterologous expression in bacteria of the bovine clathrin hub fragment ( heavy chain residues 1074 - 1675 ) has de - fined structural and functional features of the clathrin tri - skelion . The hub fragment trimerizes , binds clathrin light chains , and , in electron micrographs , resembles the corre - sponding domain in the whole triskelion , extending from the central vertex to the bend in the leg . Deletion mutagen - esis of the hub fragment has mapped domains responsible for the hub properties . In addition , studies of the hub self - assembly reaction , which resembles that of whole clathrin , have revealed new roles for the light chains and the distal portions of the triskelion legs in regulation of clathrin as - sembly . Mapping Functional Regions of Clathrin and Folding Predictions A model for clathrin folding ( Figure 7A ) incorporating data from studies of the recombinant hubs and data from previ - ous studies ( NBthke et al . , 1992 ) orients the functional subdomains within the hub region of the triskelion ( Figure 76 ) . The region mediating trimerization was mapped be - tween residue 1550 and the C - terminus and induces tri - merization of MBP when expressed at the C - terminus . Combined results of expression and proteolysis experi - ments suggest that the minimal trimerized sequence for the bovine clathrin heavy chain is between residues 1550 and 1589 , with C - terminal flanking residues up to a bound - ary of 1615 required for stabilization during folding . The molecular mass estimated for proteolytic fragments of clathrin that behaved as trimers ( 1074 - l 587 ) or monomers ( 1074 - 1481 ) and for which the N - terminal residues were known suggested that 1587 was the C - terminal limit to maintain trimerization . However , the recombinant hub fragments required residues between 1608 and 1615 to fold into stable trimers . The discrepancy between the ex - pression and proteolysis data is most likely explained by folding requirements . Domain mapping by proteolysis in - volves removing a fragment from the whole triskelion , which had already folded into its final structure with the benefit of stabilizing regions present in the entire se - quence . Domain mapping by deletion mutagenesis re - quires the domain to fold in the absence of potential stabi - lizing sequences , which may make it less stable , as reported for a mutant yeast clathrin heavy chain truncated at the equivalent of residue 1589 ( Lemmon et al . , 1991 ) . At this point , it is unclear what the structural basis for trimerization might be . Secondary structure predictions ( Chou and Fasman , 1978 ; Gamier et al . , 1978 ) suggest a primarily a - helical conformation for the trimerized se - quence ( 1550 - l 589 ) in clathrin heavy chains of all species ( Table 1 ) and an a helix for the stabilizing region ( 1590 - 1615 ) of mammalian , Drosophila , and nematode clathrin . One possible structure implied by these data is a “but - Cell 264 Figure 7 . Models for the Folding and Assembly of the Clathrin Tri - skelion Hub ( A ) Model for how residues 1074 - 1675 of the clathrin heavy chain are distributed within the hub fragment of the clathrin triskelion . The model ( see Discussion ) is based on the properties of the recombinant hub fragments described in this manuscript and the properties of proteo - lytic fragments of clathrin triskelions described in previous studies from this laboratory ( Nlthke et al . , 1992 ) . The domain responsible for trimerization is mapped within residues 1550 - l 615 . Previous proteoly - sis studies indicated that residues 1438 - 1481 ( darkly stippled region ) are part ofapredicted coiled - coil domain ( shown by the white and then dotted coil from 1460 - 1490 ) and are required for light chain binding . Studies presented here indicate that sequences within the flanking residues 1513 - 1522 and 1213 - 1313 ( lightly stippled regions ) are re - quired for this domain to fold properly and may , along with intermediate sequences , also constitute part of the light chain - binding site . This correlates with the previous prediction that the heavy chain folds back on itself . The predicted coiled - coil domains of the clathrin light chains that bind to the heavy chain are indicated by the solid line with two coils . The C - terminus of the light chain ( C in arrowhead ) has been shown by antibody mapping to be localized to the triskelion vertex ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1983 ; Kirchhausen and Toyoda , 1993 ) . Structure predictions , as well as antibody blocking data , suggest the N - terminus ( N in arrowhead ) of the heavy chain - binding domain of the light chain is also oriented toward the triskelion vertex , but antibody mapping studies using epitope - tagged light chains have challenged this model ( Kirchhausen and Toyoda , 1993 ) . The binding sites of MAbs X35 and X19 , which interact with the light chain - binding region , as well as X22 , are located according to their physical distance from the triskelion vertex ( Nlthke et al . , 1992 ) and the boundaries of their epitopes . ( B ) The region shown in bold delineates the location of one hub frag - ment within the whole triskelion . ( C ) Assembly of clathrin into a lattice with one triskelion at every vertex , based on stoichiometric analysis of CCVs ( Pearse and Crowther , 1987 ) . ( D ) Model of how hub fragments can assemble into a lattice based on the same interactions that drive clathrin assembly shown in ( C ) . tressed” trimeric helix , as seen in the crystal structure of hemagglutinin and suggested for the heat shock factor trimerization domain ( Carr and Kim , 1993 ; Peteranderl and Nelson , 1992 ) . Deletion mutation of hub fragments has implicated a segment between residues 1213 and 1522 in the binding of either clathrin light chain , LCa or LCb . The C - terminal boundary of this domain is longer than that predicted by proteolysis , which produced a heavy chain fragment ex - tending from 1074 - 1481 that still bound light chains and one from 1074 - 1438 that did not . From both studies , the region implicated in light chain binding includes the resi - dues from 1460 - l 489 , strongly predicted to participate in a coiled - coil helix . The involvement of coiled - coil se - quences in heavy chain - light chain interactions was antici - pated , since the interacting light chain sequences were also predicted to be coiled - coiled structures ( Brodsky et al . , 1987 ; Jackson et al . , 1987 ; Kirchhausen et al . , 1987b ) . The sequences between 1213 and 1313 and up to the predicted coiled - coil region may provide a second site of contact with the light chains or may simply influence the folding of the site between 1438 and 1481 that was pre - viously implicated by proteolysis . It has been established that two separate exons encode the heavy chain - binding region of the clathrin light chains ( Stamm et al . , 1992 ; Ponnambalam et al . , 1994 ) . This correlates with the struc - ture prediction that this region of the clathrin light chains might fold intotwo helices separated by aturn , which could each interact with the clathrin heavy chain , requiring an extended light chain - binding region as suggested by these deletion studies . The entire heavy chain region from 1213 to 1522 is predicted to be predominantly a helical ( Chou and Fasman , 1978 ; Garnier et al . , 1978 ) . Analysisof MAb binding to the hubfragmentsadds phys - ical dimensions to the model of how they fold . Previous studies have shown that MAbs X35 and X19 interaci with the light chain - binding site ( Blank and Brodsky , 1987 ) and bind 4 . 6 and 9 . 4 nm from the triskelion vertex , respectively ( Nathke et al . , 1992 ) . Binding of both X35 and Xl 9 is sensi - tive to the presence of residues between 1213 and 1313 , but , unlike light chains , they do not require residues 1493 - 1522 . MAb Xl 9 needs sequences between 1406 and 1438 ( Nathke et al . , 1992 ) while X35 requires residues 1483 - 1493 . These data orient X35 and Xl 9 at opposite ends of the predicted light chain - binding coiled - coil domain ( 1460 - 1489 ) and also implicate residues 1213 - 1313 in forming their binding sites . As with light chain binding , it is not clear which sequences are needed only for epitope folding and which are directly involved in binding , The epitope for MAb X22 , which was previously localized to between 1109 and 1438 , has now been mapped more precisely , requiring residues 1109 - l 128 . X22 binds to the triskelion at 14 . 5 nm from the vertex , consistent with the boundary of the hub localizing to the bend in the leg of the triskelion , which occurs at about 17 nm ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1986 ) . Proteolysis studies indicated that certain light chain fragments remained associated only with trimerized heavy chain fragments , although monomeric heavy chain frag - ments can bind to a light chain - affinity column ( Nathke et al . , 1992 ) . These observations suggested that the tri - merization and light chain - binding domains might interact or even partially overlap . Studies of hub mutants demon - strate that light chain binding and trimerization are medi - ated by separate regions and can occur independently of each other . However , the hub studies further demonstrate that the minimal distance between the two domains could ; l $ hrin Triskelion Hub Assembly and Folding be as little as 26 residues ( 1523 - 1549 ) , indicating that they are sufficiently close in the triskelion that they could potentially influence each other’s function . Hub Assembly and Implications for Clathrin Lattice Formation Clathrin hub fragments coexpressed with LCb self - assemble under the same low pH - and calcium - sensitive conditions that induce triskelion assembly . Hub fragments alone alS0 self - assemble in a reversible calciumindepen - dent fashion , with a higher pH threshold . These results confirm a role for light chains in providing calcium sensitiv - ity of clathrin assembly . In addition , they demonstrate that light chains prevent assembly at physiological pH , al - towing intracellular clathrin assembly to be regulated by adaptor molecules . Presumably , this pH dependence con - ferred by light chains assures that clathrin assembles onto membranes where adaptors are bound and prevents ran - dom self - assembly of cellular clathrin in the cytoplasm , The hub fragments without light chain generally formed more extensive assembled arrays than hub - LCb under the same assembly conditions , again consistent with a regulatory role for clathrin light chains . However , these results also confirm that light chains are not required for the minimal interactions leading to triskelion assembly ( Winkler and Stanley , 1983 ) . Considering the stoichiometry of triskelion assembly ( Figure 7C ) , it might be expected that removal of the distal leg domains would not prevent assembly or even lattice formation ( Figure 7D ) . Electron microscopy of the assem - bled hubs with or without light chains indicated that it is possible for them to form planar lattices , but they more frequently assemble in multiple directions . The planar lat - tices formed by hubs had very little curvature , compared with polyhedra formed by native clathrin . These results suggest that the distal domains of the triskelion legs con - trol the directionality of clathrin assembly as well as the curvature . Since the presence of adaptor molecules is required for purified clathrin to assemble at physiological pH , , , it was of interest to establish whether adaptor molecules interact with hub fragments . When adaptors were combined with disassembled hub fragments ( with or without LCb ) , they did not enhance their assembly and , in fact , slightly inhib - ited hub self - assembly when it was initiated by lowering the pH . This result implied a possible adaptor - binding in - teraction without an effect on assembly . This observation is consistent with the proposal that adaptors bind two dis - tinct sites on the triskelion ( Keen et al . , 1991 ) one being in the N - terminal domain and one in the hub region . If adaptors nucleate triskelion assembly by bringing to - gether the proximal and distal domains of triskelion legs , then they would not be expected to enhance hub assem - bly , which their observed behavior confirms . Assembly properties of the recombinant hub fragments have revealed that additional control of clathrin assembly is mediated by light chains , adaptors , and the distal portion of the triskelion leg . However , the hubs themselves have the predominantly a - helical light chain - binding region that consistently colocalizes with the binding sites for MAbs X19 and X35 , which inhibit clathrin assembly . Structural features of this region resemble those of intermediate fila - ments ( Jackson etal . , 1987 ; Nathkeetal . , 1992 ) , sofurther mutagenesis to determine which features of this region mediate hub self - assembly is likely to shed light on self - assembly reactions that may be shared by clathrin and other self - assem bling proteins . All features of the recombi - nant hub fragments suggest that they fold similarly to their conformation within the triskelion . Therefore , crystalliza - tion of the hub fragment would make it possible to deter - mine the structure of a key functional domain of clathrin and thereby understand itsfunction atthedetailed molecu - lar level . Experimental Procedures Determination of the Bovine Clathrin Heavy Chain Sequence Partial cDNAs for human clathrin heavy chain , obtained from R . lozzo of Thomas Jefferson University ( Dodge et al . , 1991 ) and the American Type Culture Collection ( # 85067 ) ( Adams et al . , 1993 ) were used to isolate cDNA clones for residues 138 - 393 and 393 - 865 ( numbering based on the rat clathrin heavy chain sequence ) from a bovine lympho - cytehgtl0 library ( Enniset al . , 1988 ) and clonesfor residues 865 - 1315 and 1413 - 3’ untranslated region from a bovine retina hgti0 library ( Nathans and Hogness , 1983 ) . Remaining sequences were deter - mined by RT - PCR using total RNA ( Chomczynski and Sacchi , 1987 ) from Madin - Darby bovine kidney cells . Multiple RT - PCR clones ( resi - dues 1 - 321 , l - 393 , 71 - 321 , 1315 - 1413 , and 991 - 1413 ) were ana - lyzed . DNA sequencing for the coding region was performed on both strands using the dideoxy method ( Sanger et al . , 1977 ) . Plasmid Construction DNA corresponding to hub residues 1074 - 1675 was subcloned from cDNA and RT - PCR clones into the pET15b plasmid ( Novagen ) using Xhol and BamHl restriction sites , providing the expressed protein with an N - terminal polyhistidine tag . cDNA for neuronal LCb ( Jackson et al . , 1987 ) , obtained from P . Parham of Stanford University , was cloned into the pET15b vector using Ncol - Xhol to express LCb with no poly - histidine tag . Neuronal LCb cDNA was inserted upstream of the hub sequence in pET15b for coexpression by the T7 promoter . Deletion mutants were generated by PCR , introducing a stop codon at the desired position . Selected clathrin heavy chain C - terminal sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pMALc2 vector ( New En - gland Biolabs ) , producing fusion proteins with MBP located at the N - terminus . Recombinant Protein Purification Polyhistidine - tagged clathrin heavy chain fragments were produced in BL21 ( DE3 ) bacteria ( Novagen ) by induction with 0 . 8 mM isopropyl + - o - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 3 hrat 30 % . Proteins were purified from bacterial lysate in binding buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCI [ pH 7 . 91 , 0 . 5 M NaCI , 5 mM imidazole ) using Ni * + affinity resin and eluted with either binding buffer plus 245 mM imidazole or 100 mM ethyldiethyl tetra - acetic acid ( EDTA ) and then were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 9 ) . Hub and hub - LCb were further purified by size exclusion chromatography ( Superose 6 column , 2 . 6 x 70 cm ; Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Incorporated ) . To calculate the ratio of LCb bound to hubs , we determined the concentration of purified hub - LCb by Brad - ford protein assay ( Bio - Rad ) . Then , the heavy chain fragment was removed by heat denaturation and centrifugation ( Lisanti et al . , 1982 ; Brodsky et al . , 1983 ) , and the concentration of LCb was determined from the supernatant . MBP fusion proteins were produced in DH5a bacteria ( GIBC0 BRL ) by induction with 0 . 4 mM IPTG for 3 hr at 30 % . Proteins were purified from bacterial lysate in one - tenth culture volume of column buffer ( 10 mM NaP04 [ pH 7 . 21 , 0 . 5 M NaCI , 1 mM ethylene glycol - bis @ amino ethyl ether ) N , N , N’ , N’ - tetra - acetic acid [ EGTA ] , 10 mM 8 - mercap - toethanol , 1 mM NaN3 ) using amylose affinity resin ( New England Biolabs ) and eluted with column buffer plus 10 mM maltose . Purified control MBP was obtained from New England Biolabs . Cell 266 Proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) with 10 % polyacrylamide ( Laemmli , 1970 ) using the following marker proteins : myosin ( 205 kDa ) , 5 - galac - tosidase ( 116 kDa ) , phosphorylase b ( 97 kDa ) , BSA ( 67 kDa ) , oval - bumin ( 43 kDa ) , and carbonic anhydrase ( 29 kDa ) ( Sigma ) . UltraViOlet CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco 500 spectropolarimeter . Light Scattering Assay for Clathrin Assembly Protein samples were dialyzed into 10 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 9 ) and then centrifuged ( 20 min at 100 , 000 x g ) , and the supernatant was diluted to 0 . 3 mglml with IO mM Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 9 ) . Assembly of 100 ul in a spectrophotometer microcell was initiated by addition of 4 ul of 1 M Z - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) buffer at varied pH values , as indicated , with 10 mM EGTA and with or without 75 mM CaCl * . The MES buffers above pH 7 were made fresh before each use to ensure the accuracy of their pH . OD 320 values were measured at 12 s intervals using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer . After 3 min , disassembly was induced with 4 ul of 1 M Tris - HCI ( pH 9 . 0 ) and OD320 values were recorded for another 2 min ( Blank and Brodsky , 1986 ) . To ensure that hub - LCb preparations were completely saturated with clathrin light chain , we supplemented them with 100 uglml purified LCb , produced by boiling purified hub - LCb for 10 min and removing precipitated heavy chain fragments by centrifugation ( 13 , 000 x g ) . Bovine brain clathrin was purified by size exclusion chromatography from freshly isolated coated vesicles , extracted with 0 . 5 M Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 0 ) , as previously described ( Manfredi and Bazari , 1987 ) . Electron Microscopy of Recombinant Proteins For platinum shadowing , purified recombinant hub fragments or puri - fied bovine brain clathrin ( OD 280 = 1 . 6 ) were diluted 50 - fold in 45 % glycerol , 50 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 9 ) sprayed onto mica , and then shadowed for 4 min with platinum by rotary evaporation ( Ungewickell and Bran - ton , 1981 ) . For negative staining , purified recombinant hub fragments or purified bovine brain clathrin was diluted to ODZaO = 0 . 4 and assem - bled as described . Samples were then diluted 5 - fold in the buffer used for assembly , and 7 ul was applied to carbon - coated grids and stained with 2 % uranyl acetate partially dissolved in 50 % ethanol . Samples were examined with a Phillips EM400 microscope . Clathrin Light Chain Binding by Recombinant Proteins A mixture of bovine brain LCa and LCb was produced by centrifugation ( 13 , 000 x g ) of purified bovine brain clathrin boiled for 10 min ( Lisanti et al . , 1982 ; Brodsky et al . , 1983 ) . To test light chain binding , 10 pg of purified recombinant clathrin fragment was bound to 20 ul of Ni2 + affinity resin for 20 min . and the resin was washed once with 500 ul of 50 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 9 ) to remove unbound proteins . Mixed LCa - LCb ( 2 ug ) in 50 ul of 0 . 1 M Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 0 ) was then added to the resin and incubated at 4°C for at least 30 min . Unbound proteins were removed from the resin following centrifugation , and the resin was washed three times with 50 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 9 ) . Bound proteins were eluted with 50 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 9 ) 0 . 5 M NaCl , 0 . 5 M imidazole . Both bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , followed by immunoblotting ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) with MAb CON . 1 , which recognizes a determinant shared by LCa and LCb ( Nathke et al . , 1992 ) . Antibody binding was detected with anti - mouse immuno - globulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( Boehringer Mann - heim ) using the enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) substrate ( Amer - sham ) and exposing the blot to film . Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography Affinity - purified recombinant hub fragments in 0 . 5 M Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 9 ) or affinity - purified MBP fusion proteins in 50 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 7 . 9 ) were applied to a Superose 6 column ( 1 . 6 x 40 cm ) , and column fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . The column was calibrated with the following marker proteins ( Phar - macia ) : catalase ( 232 kDa ) , aldolase ( 158 kDa ) , BSA ( 67 kDa ) , oval - bumin ( 43 kDa ) and chymotrypsinogen A ( 25 kDa ) . Antibody Binding to Recombinant Proteins For enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , 1 ug of purified recombinant protein in 100 ~ 1 of 0 . 1 M carbonate - bicarbonate buffer ( pH 9 . 2 ) . was applied to the well of an ELISA plate . After blocking with 2 % nonfat milk in phosphate - buffered saline ( pH 7 . 4 ) 100 ul of‘MAb Xi g , X35 , or X22 ( 10 ug / ml ) was added . Antibody binding was detected with goat anti - mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to alkaline phospha - tase ( Bio - Rad ) with the substrate p - nitrophenyl phosphate ( Pierce ) and measured by the MR700 microplate reader ( Dynatech ) at & TO . Alternatively , 5 ug of purified polyhistidine - tagged recombinant pro - teins in binding buffer was rebound to 20 ul of Ni * + affinity resin . Resin was blocked with 200 ul of 0 . 5 mg / ml BSA in binding buffer and then incubated with 50 ul of MAb at 20 uglml in wash buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCI [ pH 7 . 91 , 0 . 2 M NaCI , 0 . 4 % NP - 40 , 60 mM imidazole ) at 4’C for 2 hr . Unbound proteins were removed , the resin was washed three times with wash buffer , and bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS - PAGE sample buffer ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . Unbound and bound fractions were analyzed for the presence of antibody by SDS - PAGE and by immunoblotting with anti - mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) using the ECLsub - strate ( Amersham ) .
