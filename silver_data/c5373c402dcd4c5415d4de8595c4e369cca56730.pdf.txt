This article is an open access publication Abstract Vedolizumab is a humanized anti - a 4 b 7 integrin monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks trafﬁcking of memory T cells to inﬂamed gut tissue by inhibiting the a 4 b 7 - mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( MAd - CAM - 1 ) interaction . Approved for treating patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) or Crohn’s disease ( CD ) , vedolizumab is administered as a 300 mg intravenous infusion . Vedolizumab undergoes a rapid , saturable , non - linear , target - mediated elimination process at low concentrations and a slower , linear , non - speciﬁc elimination process at higher concentrations . At therapeutic concentrations , vedolizumab primarily under - goes linear elimination . From population pharmacokinetic modeling , the vedolizumab terminal elimination half - life ( t (cid:2) b ) was estimated to be 25 . 5 days ; linear clearance ( CL L ) was similar for patients with UC ( 0 . 159 L / day ) and CD ( 0 . 155 L / day ) . Extreme low albumin concentrations and extreme high body weight values were potentially clini - cally important predictors of vedolizumab CL L . Other factors , including concomitant therapy use ( methotrexate , azathioprine , mercaptopurine , or aminosalicylates ) or prior tumor necrosis factor - a ( TNF - a ) antagonist use , had no clinically relevant effects on CL L . A positive exposure – efﬁcacy relationship for clinical remission and clinical response was apparent for vedolizumab induction therapy in patients with UC or CD . On average , patients with higher albumin , lower fecal calprotectin ( UC only ) , lower C - reactive protein ( CD only ) , and no prior TNF - a antag - onist use had a higher probability of remission . Off drug , 10 % of patients with UC or CD were positive for anti - drug antibodies .

Vedolizumab undergoes a rapid , saturable , non - linear , target - mediated elimination process at low concentrations and a slower , linear , non - speciﬁc elimination process at higher concentrations . At therapeutic concentrations , vedolizumab primarily undergoes linear elimination . Vedolizumab linear clearance ( CL L ) was similar in patients with ulcerative colitis ( UC ) and patients with Crohn’s disease ( CD ) . The terminal elimination half - life ( t (cid:2) b ) of vedolizumab is 25 . 5 days . Only extreme low albumin concentrations ( \ 3 . 2 g / dL ) and extreme high body weight values ( [ 120 kg ) were identiﬁed as potential clinically important predictors of vedolizumab CL L . Positive exposure – efﬁcacy relationships for clinical remission and clinical response were evident for vedolizumab induction therapy , which appeared to be steeper in patients with UC than in patients with CD . Off drug , 10 % of patients with UC or CD were positive for anti - drug antibodies ( ADAs ) . Patients who were persistently ADA positive during treatment ( positive at two or more consecutive visits ) had decreased vedolizumab trough serum concentrations . 1 Introduction The inﬂammatory bowel diseases ulcerative colitis ( UC ) and Crohn’s disease ( CD ) are chronic diseases that are charac - terized by exacerbated inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrate into gut mucosaltissue [ 1 , 2 ] . Currentlyavailabletreatmentoptionsfor patients with UC or CD include glucocorticosteroids , immunosuppressants ( i . e . , azathioprine , mercaptopurine , or methotrexate ) , tumor necrosis factor - a ( TNF - a ) antagonists , and , most recently , integrin antagonists [ 3 – 5 ] . Vedolizumab ( previous versions were known as LDP - 02 , MLN - 02 , and MLN0002 ) is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds speciﬁcally to the a 4 b 7 integrin , thereby modulating the traf - ﬁcking of memory T cells into inﬂamed gut mucosal tissue [ 6 , 7 ] . Vedolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC or CD and is administered as a 300 mg intravenous ( IV ) infusion over approximately 30 min at 0 , 2 , and 6 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter [ 7 , 8 ] . The European prescribing information sug - gests that some patients with UC or CD who have experienced a decrease in their response to vedolizumab may beneﬁt from an increase in dosing frequency to every 4 weeks [ 8 ] . The clinical proﬁle of vedolizumab is consistent with its binding speciﬁcity , with evidence of therapeutic beneﬁt in patients with UC or CD [ 9 – 13 ] and a lack of systemic immunosup - pression [ 14 , 15 ] . The aim of this article is to review the clinical pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , exposure – ef - ﬁcacy relationships , and immunogenicity of vedolizumab . 2 Vedolizumab Structure Vedolizumab is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin G 1 ( IgG 1 ) monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese ham - ster ovary cells [ 7 ] . Vedolizumab was generated by fusing the binding domains from the mouse anti - human a 4 b 7 monoclonal antibody Act - 1 to a conventional human IgG 1 scaffold . In addition , two mutations were introduced into the Fc region of vedolizumab , which eliminated some Fc - me - diated functions such as cytotoxicity [ 16 ] . Vedolizumab is composed of two light chains of the kappa subclass and two heavy chains linked by two disulﬁde bridges , forming a Y - structure that is typical of immunoglobulins . The molec - ular weight of vedolizumab is approximately 147 kDa [ 7 ] . 3 Vedolizumab Mechanism of Action A signiﬁcant body of biochemical , preclinical , and clinical evidence supports the gut - selective anti - inﬂammatory mechanism of action of vedolizumab , which has been reviewed in detail elsewhere [ 17 ] . Vedolizumab binds speciﬁcally to the a 4 b 7 integrin heterodimer , but not to the functionally distinct a 4 b 1 or a E b 7 integrin heterodimers , thereby inhibiting the binding of a 4 b 7 - expressing cells to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( MAdCAM - 1 ) and ﬁbronectin , but not to vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) [ 6 ] . This inhibitory effect is reversible on removal of vedolizumab ; binding of peripheral blood lymphocytes to MAdCAM - 1 was partially restored within 24 h and fully restored after 4 days [ 16 ] . Although mod - erately expressed on several other types of leukocytes , such as B cells , eosinophils , and natural killer cells , the a 4 b 7 integrin is preferentially expressed on a subset of memory CD4 ? T cells and mediates binding of these cells to MAdCAM - 1 expressed on endothelial cells [ 6 , 18 , 19 ] . The a 4 b 7 – MAdCAM - 1 interaction is required for lymphocyte 1288 M . Rosario et al . trafﬁcking to the gut , and it is key to the pathology of inﬂammatory bowel diseases . By binding to the a 4 b 7 integrin , vedolizumab selectively inhibits adhesion of memory T cells to MAdCAM - 1 and the migration of these cells to the site of gut inﬂammation [ 6 ] . Vedolizumab does not activate lymphocytes , affect cytokine production by differentiated T cells , or lyse target cells by complement - dependent cytotoxicity or antibody - dependent cell - medi - ated cytotoxicity [ 16 ] . Blockade of the a 4 b 7 integrin by vedolizumab has been shown to elicit gut - selective anti - inﬂammatory effects in primates [ 20 , 21 ] . The gut selectivity of vedolizumab has also been conﬁrmed in clinical studies . In a vaccination study in healthy volunteers , vedolizumab attenuated the response to an enteral antigen challenge ( oral cholera vaccine ) but did not affect the response to a parenteral antigen challenge ( intramuscular hepatitis B vaccine ) [ 14 ] . In contrast to natalizumab , vedolizumab had no effect on T cell trafﬁcking to the central nervous system in preclin - ical and clinical studies , providing further evidence of its gut selectivity [ 15 , 22 – 24 ] . 4 Vedolizumab Pharmacokinetic Properties The pharmacokinetic properties of vedolizumab were evaluated in single - dose studies in healthy volunteers and in multiple - dose studies in patients with UC or CD [ 11 – 13 , 25 – 28 ] . In these studies , vedolizumab serum con - centrations were measured using a validated sandwich enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , as previ - ously described [ 25 ] . The lower limit of quantiﬁcation of this assay was 1 . 25 ng / mL ( 0 . 125 l g / mL in undiluted serum ) [ 25 ] . Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using standard non - compartmental methods . A population pharmacokinetic analysis was also per - formed to assess the effects of patient demographics and other covariates on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab in patients with UC or CD using extensively collected data from phase I and II studies and sparsely collected data from the phase III GEMINI studies [ 29 ] . A repeated - measures analysis was conducted using a non - linear mixed effects modeling ( NONMEM ) approach . 4 . 1 Single - Dose Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Volunteers Vedolizumab was administered as a single IV infusion to healthy volunteers on a body weight - adjusted basis over the dose range of 0 . 2 – 10 . 0 mg / kg in a phase I study [ 25 ] . After reaching peak concentrations , vedolizumab serum concentrations declined in a generally linear fashion until concentrations reached approximately 10 l g / mL ( Fig . 1 ) . Thereafter , concentrations appeared to decline in a non - linear fashion . Vedolizumab maximum observed serum concentration ( C max ) was dose proportional over the dose range tested ( Table 1 ) . Greater than dose - proportional increases in the vedolizumab area under the serum con - centration – time curve ( AUC ) from time zero to inﬁnity ( AUC 0 - ? ) and dose - dependent decreases in clearance ( CL ) and increases in terminal elimination half - life ( t (cid:2) b ) were observed from 0 . 2 to 2 . 0 mg / kg ( Table 1 ) . At dose levels [ 2 . 0 mg / kg , the increases in AUC 0 - ? were dose proportional and CL and t (cid:2) did not change . These data suggest that a rapid elimination process becomes saturated as the vedolizumab dose increases , and slower linear elimination processes likely account for a large fraction of vedolizumab CL at higher concentrations . Vedolizumab was also administered as a single IV infusion to healthy volunteers on a ﬁxed - dose basis over the dose range of 180 – 750 mg . Comparison of the data across these studies revealed that vedolizumab exposure increased in a dose - proportional manner at doses [ 180 mg ( Table 2 ) . The apparent linear pharmacokinetics at doses [ 180 mg ( equivalent to 2 . 4 mg / kg in a 75 kg individual ) is consistent with the data from the healthy volunteer study with body weight - adjusted ( mg / kg ) dosing . 4 . 2 Multiple - Dose Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) or Crohn’s Disease ( CD ) The pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab following repeat IV infusions were evaluated in patients with UC or CD over Fig . 1 Mean vedolizumab serum concentrations over time after a single intravenous infusion in healthy volunteers . Individuals who were persistently anti - drug antibody positive ( C 2 positive samples or 1 positive sample with a titer of C 25 ) were excluded from the analysis Figure reproduced from Rosario et al . [ 25 ] ( (cid:2) Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016 ) , with permission of Springer Clinical Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics , and Immunogenicity of Vedolizumab 1289 the dose range of 0 . 5 – 10 mg / kg in phase II studies [ 26 – 28 ] . In patients with UC , vedolizumab concentrations increased with increasing dose over the range of 2 – 10 mg / kg , after an IV infusion on days 1 , 15 , 29 , and 85 [ 27 ] . After the last dose on day 85 , vedolizumab concentrations decreased in an approximately bi - exponential fashion . The pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab were dose proportional over the 2 – 10 mg / kg dose range based on C max and AUC during the dosing interval ( AUC s ) after dosing on days 1 and 85 ( Table 3 ) . The pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab in patients with UC or CD were also assessed in the phase III GEMINI studies using a sparse ( population - based ) sampling scheme . During GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 , patients received a 300 mg IV infusion of vedolizumab at weeks 0 , and 2 , ( induction phase ) and every 4 or 8 weeks thereafter start - ing at week 6 ( maintenance phase ) [ 11 , 12 ] . During GEMINI 3 , patients received a 300 mg IV infusion of vedolizumab at weeks 0 , 2 , and 6 ( induction only ) [ 13 ] . At week 6 , mean vedolizumab trough serum concentrations were similar in patients with UC in GEMINI 1 and in patients with CD in GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 ( Table 4 ) . During the maintenance phases of both GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 , the last vedolizumab trough concentration was Table 1 Vedolizumab pharmacokinetic parameters after a single intravenous infusion ( 0 . 2 – 10 . 0 mg / kg ) in healthy volunteers [ reproduced from Rosario et al .

Rosario et al . measured at week 46 and was used to represent the end - of - treatment , steady - state trough concentration . At week 46 , the mean vedolizumab trough concentration was higher in patients who received vedolizumab every 4 weeks than in patients who received vedolizumab every 8 weeks in both studies ( Table 4 ) . The median trough serum concentration – time proﬁle for each treatment regimen during the maintenance phase of GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 has been previously reported [ 29 ] . Patients who received two doses of vedolizumab during induction and placebo during maintenance had measurable vedolizumab trough concentrations in serum until week 38 . 4 . 3 Population Pharmacokinetic Model From the population pharmacokinetic analysis , the phar - macokinetics of vedolizumab were best described by a two - compartment model with zero - order input and parallel linear and non - linear elimination , similar to that described for other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies [ 29 , 30 ] . The non - linear elimination process was modeled using a Michaelis – Menten equation . The overall inter - individual variability was moderate to large [ 29 ] . The effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab were investigated using a full covariate modeling approach [ 29 , 31 ] . Inferences about the clinical relevance of parameters were based on the resulting parameter estimates and measures of estimation precision [ Bayesian 95 % credible intervals ( CDIs ) ] from the ﬁnal model . Covariate effect sizes on linear CL ( CL L ) of less than ± 25 % from the typical population value , when eval - uated over a representative range of covariate values , were not considered clinically relevant changes [ 29 ] . Pharma - cokinetic parameter estimates derived from the model are described in Sects . 4 . 4 – 4 . 6 , as are the effects of covariates on vedolizumab CL L .

From the ﬁnal popu - lation pharmacokinetic model , vedolizumab V ss was esti - mated to be 4 . 84 L for both patients with UC and patients with CD [ volume of distribution in the central compart - ment ( V c ) = 3 . 19 L plus volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment ( V p ) = 1 . 65 L ] [ 29 ] . The V ss val - ues estimated for vedolizumab are approximately equal to the volume of plasma in humans and are generally similar to those reported for other therapeutic monoclonal anti - bodies [ 32 ] . After a single IV infusion of vedolizumab 450 mg in healthy volunteers , vedolizumab was not detected in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid , suggesting that vedoli - zumab does not penetrate the blood – brain barrier [ 15 ] . 4 . 5 Elimination Because of their large molecular size , therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are not directly excreted in urine ; rather they are degraded to peptides and amino acids that are either reused by the body or excreted by the kidneys [ 32 ] . Several mechanisms are reportedly involved in the elimination of monoclonal antibodies , including proteolytic degradation by the liver or retic - uloendothelial system , target - mediated elimination , and non - speciﬁc endocytosis [ 32 ] . Vedolizumab undergoes a rapid , saturable , non - linear , target - mediated elimination process at low concentrations and a slower , linear , non - speciﬁc elimination process at higher concentrations . From the ﬁnal population pharmacokinetic model , the t (cid:2) of vedolizumab was estimated to be 25 . 5 days , which only accounts for elimination through the linear process [ 29 ] . Estimates of t (cid:2) obtained from non - compartmental analyses in the phase I and phase II studies account for elimination through both linear and non - linear processes ( Tables 1 , 2 ) and , therefore , are slightly lower than the estimate obtained from population pharmacokinetic modeling . Population estimates of CL L were 0 . 159 L / day for patients with UC and 0 . 155 L / day for patients with CD [ 29 ] . Non - linear elimination was described by a maximum elimination rate ( V max ) of 0 . 265 mg / day and concentration at half V max ( K m ) of 0 . 964 l g / mL [ 29 ] . The relationship between non - linear , linear , and total CL values across a range of vedolizu - mab concentrations is depicted in Fig . 2 . At therapeutic concentrations , as indicated by trough concentration at steady state from dosing every 8 weeks ( [ 10 l g / mL ) [ 7 ] , vedolizumab is eliminated primarily through the linear pathway . 4 . 6 Impact of Demographic and Other Covariates on Vedolizumab Pharmacokinetics 4 . 6 . 1 Disease Type The population pharmacokinetic analysis investigated population differences in vedolizumab CL L and V c for patients with UC or CD [ 29 ] . Population estimates of CL L were similar for patients with UC and for patients with CD , as described in Sect . 4 . 5 . The results also indicated that V c did not appreciably differ between the two diseases ( point estimate of 1 . 01 and 95 % CDI of 0 . 989 – 1 . 03 ) [ 29 ] . 4 . 6 . 2 Sex , Age , and Race Sex differences in pharmacokinetics have been reported for other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies . In general , vol - ume of distribution and / or CL of monoclonal antibodies increase with body size and , thus , are higher in men than in women [ 33 , 34 ] . No clinical study to date has directly assessed the effect of sex on vedolizumab pharmacoki - netics . From the population pharmacokinetic model , sex was determined not to be a clinically relevant covariate after adjusting for other predictors of vedolizumab CL L ; the estimates of CL L and V c were only approximately 10 and 6 % lower , respectively in female patients than male patients [ 29 ] . No dedicated clinical study has assessed the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab . However , population pharmacokinetic modeling indicated that age had no clinically relevant effect on vedolizumab CL L within the age range tested ( 18 – 78 years ) ( point estimate of - 0 . 0346 and 95 % CDI of - 0 . 0788 to 0 . 01 ) [ 29 ] . The impact of race on vedolizumab pharmacokinetics has not been directly evaluated in a clinical study or by Fig . 2 Relationship between linear clearance ( CL L ) , non - linear clearance ( CL NL ) , and total clearance ( CL total ) of vedolizumab 1292 M . Rosario et al . population pharmacokinetic modeling . From a cross - study comparison , the pharmacokinetic parameters observed in Japanese patients with UC after a 150 or 300 mg IV infusion of vedolizumab were similar to those in Western ( non - Hispanic White ) patients with UC after a 2 – 10 mg / kg dose ( * 150 – 750 mg ) [ 27 , 35 ] . 4 . 6 . 3 Body Weight Body weight has often been reported to be a predictor of volume of distribution and / or CL of therapeutic mono - clonal antibodies , although its effect is not always con - sidered clinically relevant . During the clinical development program , vedolizumab was administered initially on a body weight - adjusted ( mg / kg ) basis and subsequently on a ﬁxed - dose basis ( mg ) . The impact of body weight on the phar - macokinetics of vedolizumab was ﬁrst assessed in a phase I study in healthy volunteers . The results of this study revealed that weight - adjusted dosing overcompensated for exposure of vedolizumab in individuals with higher weight , suggesting that weight - adjusted dosing may have little advantage over ﬁxed doses ( unpublished data ) . Therefore , ﬁxed doses of vedolizumab were used in all subsequent studies , including in the phase III GEMINI studies . The effect of body weight on vedolizumab CL L was further assessed through population pharmacokinetic modeling [ 29 ] . An allometric relationship was included in the model to describe the relationship between body weight and CL L . From this analysis , body weight was determined to be a statistically signiﬁcant predictor of vedolizumab CL L , with a point estimate of 0 . 362 and a narrow 95 % CDI of 0 . 299 – 0 . 427 . Body weight did not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on CL L for individuals weighing \ 120 kg . However , the typical individual weighing 120 kg had a 19 % probability of having a CL L value [ 25 % higher than that of a patient weighing 70 kg ( reference patient ; albumin of 4 . 0 g / dL for both cases ) , an effect that is con - sidered of potential clinical relevance [ 29 ] . 4 . 6 . 4 Disease Activity The effect of disease activity on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab was assessed through population modeling using the partial Mayo score and the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) score at baseline . Both covariates had no effect on vedolizumab CL L ( point estimate of - 0 . 0515 and 95 % CDI of - 0 . 14 to 0 . 0358 for CDAI score ; point estimate of 0 . 0408 and 95 % CDI of - 0 . 0336 to 0 . 115 for partial Mayo score ) [ 29 ] . For patients with UC from GEMINI 1 , median mea - sured vedolizumab trough serum concentrations at week 6 were lower in patients with higher endoscopic subscores at week 6 ( more severe disease ) [ 36 ] . Patients with a endo - scopic score of 3 , indicating severe disease , had a median trough concentration ( 19 . 6 l g / mL ) below the overall median concentration ( 25 . 6 l g / mL ) at week 6 . A trend toward greater estimated vedolizumab CL L in patients with a higher endoscopic subscore was noted ( Fig . 3 ) [ 29 ] . These ﬁndings are consistent with those for other thera - peutic monoclonal antibodies used for the treatment of UC and CD [ 37 , 38 ] . It is possible that the apparent association between higher endoscopic subscores and faster vedolizu - mab CL L at week 6 is not causal and could be attributed to several confounding factors , such as additional drug loss into the inﬂamed gastrointestinal tract ( drug - losing enteropathy ) [ 39 ] . The apparent relationship between vedolizumab CL L and the endoscopic subscore warrants further investigation . 4 . 6 . 5 Fecal Calprotectin , C - Reactive Protein , and Albumin The effects of fecal calprotectin and C - reactive protein ( CRP ) concentrations on vedolizumab CL L were evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic model as additional measures of disease severity [ 29 ] . For fecal calprotectin , the estimated effect size , although statistically signiﬁcant , was small and not considered to be clinically relevant Fig . 3 Estimated individual vedolizumab linear clearance ( CL L ) by Mayo endoscopic subscore at week 6 in patients with ulcerative colitis ( GEMINI 1 ) . Midlines represent medians ; box limits represent the 25th and 75th percentiles ; whiskers ( error bars ) represent the 10th and 90th percentiles ; and solid circles represent datapoints outside the 10th to 90th percentile range ( reproduced from Rosario et al . [ 29 ] ) Clinical Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics , and Immunogenicity of Vedolizumab 1293 ( point estimate of 0 . 0310 and 95 % CDI of 0 . 0252 – 0 . 0365 ) . An exploratory post hoc analysis suggested that , after adjusting for other predictors of vedolizumab CL L , the effect of CRP on vedolizumab CL L was also not clinically relevant and accounted for \ 1 % of the unexplained inter - individual variability in CL [ 29 ] . Albumin has been demonstrated to be a predictor of the CL of other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies [ 40 ] . From the population pharmacokinetic model , albumin concentration was a statistically signiﬁcant predictor of vedolizumab CL L , with a point estimate of - 1 . 18 and a narrow 95 % CDI of - 1 . 24 to - 1 . 13 [ 29 ] . The clinical relevance of the effect of albumin on CL L was assessed . Vedolizumab CL L for the typical individual with an albumin concentration of 3 . 2 g / dL was approximately 30 % higher than that of a patient with an albumin con - centration of 4 g / dL ( reference patient ; body weight of 70 kg in both cases ) , an effect that is considered of potential clinical relevance . 4 . 6 . 6 Prior Tumor Necrosis Factor - a Antagonist Therapy From the population pharmacokinetic model , patients who had been treated with and failed prior TNF - a antagonist therapy had 4 % faster CL L than patients who were naı¨ve to TNF - a antagonist therapy ( point estimate of 1 . 04 and 95 % CDI of 1 . 01 – 1 . 07 ) [ 29 ] . Although statistically sig - niﬁcant , this modest difference is not considered clinically relevant . 4 . 6 . 7 Anti - Drug Antibodies In the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies , the persistence of anti - drug antibodies ( ADAs ) during treatment ( measurable ADA titers at two or more consecutive visits ) was associ - ated with a substantial decrease in vedolizumab serum concentrations [ 41 ] . In GEMINI 1 , among the six patients who were persistently ADA positive , three patients had vedolizumab trough concentrations at steady state ( week 46 ) that were below the limit of quantitation ( BLQ ; \ 0 . 125 l g / mL in undiluted serum ) , one patient had a trough concentration of 4 . 17 l g / mL , one patient had a trough concentration of 3 . 46 l g / mL , and one patient had a missing pharmacokinetic blood sample . In GEMINI 2 , among the three patients who were persistently ADA positive , two patients had vedolizumab trough concentra - tions at week 46 that were BLQ and one patient had a missing sample . From the population pharmacokinetic model , vedolizu - mab CL L was predicted to be 12 % higher in patients who were ADA positive ( either persistently or transiently ) than in patients who were ADA negative ( point estimate of 1 . 12 and 95 % CDI of 1 . 05 – 1 . 2 ) [ 29 ] . Although statistically signiﬁcant , this effect was not considered to be clinically relevant . However , the small number of ADA - positive patients in this analysis limit the interpretation of this result . 4 . 7 Drug – Drug Interactions No clinical studies have directly assessed the impact of vedolizumab administration on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs . Classic drug – drug interactions mediated through effects on enzyme systems such as the cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) system are generally not expected for thera - peutic monoclonal antibodies . However , monoclonal anti - bodies that are cytokine modulators may modify the metabolism of drugs that are CYP enzyme substrates through their effects on the regulation pathways of CYP enzymes [ 32 , 42 , 43 ] . Since vedolizumab is gut selective and does not modulate systemic cytokine production [ 16 ] , the potential for CYP - mediated drug interactions with vedolizumab acting as the perpetrator is considered to be lower than that with drugs that systemically and directly affect cytokines . Published data show that small - molecule immunomod - ulators may affect the CL of therapeutic monoclonal anti - bodies , possibly through an attenuating effect on immunogenicity [ 32 , 42 , 44 , 45 ] . No clinical studies have been conducted to directly assess the effect of concomitant therapy on the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab . How - ever , the effect of concomitant immunomodulator ( methotrexate , azathioprine , mercaptopurine ) and aminos - alicylate therapy on vedolizumab CL L was assessed through population pharmacokinetic modeling . The effect of each therapy was assessed individually in the model . The ﬁndings suggest that these drugs had no clinically relevant effect on vedolizumab CL L , in contrast to the apparent effect of immunomodulators on the immuno - genicity of vedolizumab [ 29 , 46 ] . 5 Vedolizumab Pharmacokinetic – Pharmacodynamic Relationship The extent of a 4 b 7 integrin binding by vedolizumab on peripheral blood memory T cells has been evaluated in clinical studies using two ﬂow cytometry binding inter - ference assays . These assays used either the mouse mon - oclonal antibody Act - 1 , from which the binding domains of vedolizumab were derived , or MAdCAM - 1 , an endogenous ligand of a 4 b 7 integrin . Act - 1 was the only binding satu - ration biomarker used in early clinical studies , whereas a MAdCAM - 1 – murine Fc fusion ( MAdCAM - 1 - Fc ) was used in later clinical studies . Both assays rely on the same principle and have been described in detail elsewhere [ 47 ] . 1294 M . Rosario et al . In contrast to the Act - 1 assay , vedolizumab - neutralizing ADAs do not interfere with the ability of the MAdCAM - 1 assay to detect vedolizumab binding to the a 4 b 7 integrin [ 47 ] . 5 . 1 Phase I and II Studies In a single - dose phase I study in healthy volunteers , administration of vedolizumab over the dose range of 0 . 2 – 10 . 0 mg / kg resulted in rapid and near complete inhi - bition of Act - 1 and MAdCAM - 1 - Fc binding to a 4 b 7 at all timepoints at which vedolizumab was measurable in serum [ 25 ] . Once vedolizumab concentrations were no longer detectable , the inhibition of binding returned to approxi - mately baseline levels . The duration of a 4 b 7 receptor sat - uration was dose dependent . Saturation of the a 4 b 7 receptor was also evaluated fol - lowing repeat IV infusions in patients with UC or CD over the dose range of 0 . 5 – 10 . 0 mg / kg in phase II studies [ 26 – 28 ] . After administration of vedolizumab 0 . 5 or 2 . 0 mg / kg on days 1 and 29 to patients with UC , saturation of a 4 b 7 receptors on [ 90 % of peripheral blood memory T cells was evident at both weeks 4 and 6 , as determined using the Act - 1 assay [ 26 ] . In a second study in patients with UC , administration of vedolizumab 2 , 6 , or 10 mg / kg on days 1 , 15 , 29 , and 85 resulted in rapid and near - max - imal inhibition of MAdCAM - 1 - Fc binding to a 4 b 7 at all doses and timepoints at which vedolizumab was measur - able in serum ( Fig . 4 ) , consistent with the single - dose healthy volunteer study [ 27 ] . MAdCAM - 1 - Fc binding returned to approximately baseline levels when vedolizu - mab concentrations were no longer detectable . The dura - tion of a 4 b 7 receptor saturation was dose dependent . In patients with CD , near complete saturation of a 4 b 7 recep - tors was observed after administration of vedolizumab 0 . 5 or 2 . 0 mg / kg on days 1 and 29 [ 28 ] . After the dose on day 29 , complete recovery of free a 4 b 7 was evident by day 85 for the 0 . 5 mg / kg group and by day 180 for the 2 . 0 mg / kg group . 5 . 2 Population Pharmacokinetic – Pharmacodynamic Model In the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies , a 4 b 7 receptor saturation was measured using the MAdCAM - 1 - Fc assay predose at weeks 0 , 6 , and 52 . Data from these studies were pooled with data from phase I and II studies and analyzed using population pharmacokinetic – pharmacodynamic modeling [ 29 ] . The inhibition of MAdCAM - 1 – a 4 b 7 bind - ing by vedolizumab was described by a direct - effect sig - moid maximum effect ( E max ) model . No formal covariate modeling or model evaluation was conducted . From this model , the vedolizumab serum concentration at half - max - imum effect ( EC 50 ) was estimated to be 0 . 093 l g / mL , suggesting that complete receptor saturation was reached at a vedolizumab serum concentration of approximately 1 l g / mL , a concentration considered subtherapeutic [ 29 ] . Exposure – efﬁcacy data at week 6 indicate that vedolizu - mab concentrations of B 17 . 1 l g / mL in patients with UC in GEMINI 1 and B 16 l g / mL in patients with CD in GEMINI 2 during induction were associated with clinical remission rates similar to placebo [ 48 ] . These observations support the hypothesis that receptor saturation may be necessary but not sufﬁcient for clinical efﬁcacy of vedoli - zumab . The discrepancy between the vedolizumab con - centrations required for complete receptor saturation and efﬁcacy may be related to the fact that the MAdCAM - 1 - Fc assay measures a 4 b 7 saturation on circulating T cells ( as opposed to T cells in inﬂamed mucosal tissue ) . However , for another monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the b 7 subunit of the a 4 b 7 and a E b 7 integrins , the drug serum concentration required for maximal saturation of b 7 receptors on peripheral T cells was sufﬁcient for maximal occupancy of b 7 receptors in the colonic mucosa , but maximal receptor occupancy did not correlate with clinical remission [ 49 ] . The apparent lack of correlation between receptor occupancy and clinical efﬁcacy for a 4 b 7 and a E b 7 integrin antagonists requires further study . The MAdCAM - 1 assay demonstrates a 4 b 7 saturation from 1 l g / mL , sug - gesting that receptor saturation in peripheral blood lym - phocytes is required for clinical efﬁcacy but cannot achieve it alone [ 50 ] .

Any confounding factors for baseline covariates were assessed using logistic regression [ 11 , 48 ] . In these analyses , clinical remission was deﬁned as a complete Mayo score B 2 points with no individual subscore [ 1 point ; clinical response was deﬁned as a decrease in complete Mayo score C 3 points and a C 30 % decrease from baseline , with a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore C 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore B 1 point ; and mucosal healing was deﬁned as a Mayo endoscopic subscore B 1 point [ 11 ] . The quartile analyses revealed a positive exposure – re - sponse relationship for clinical remission , clinical response , and mucosal healing for vedolizumab induction therapy in patients with UC [ 11 , 48 ] . Vedolizumab con - centrations [ 17 . 1 l g / mL at week 6 were associated with higher rates of clinical remission than observed with pla - cebo ( Fig . 5a ) . From concentration quartile 1 to quartile 4 , the absolute rate increase was approximately 31 % for clinical remission , 34 % for clinical response , and 43 % for mucosal healing at week 6 ( Fig . 5a ) [ 48 ] . Consistent with these data , Mayo endoscopic scores were lower in patients with higher vedolizumab trough concentrations [ 36 ] . To account for possible confounding of the unadjusted analyses by baseline covariates , the exposure – efﬁcacy Fig . 5 Percentage of patients with clinical remission by vedolizumab trough concentration quartile at week 6 or week 10 in patients with ulcerative colitis ( GEMINI 1 ) ( a ) and patients with Crohn’s disease [ GEMINI 2 ( b ) and GEMINI 3 ( c , d ) ] . For GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 , analyses included all patients who received vedolizumab during induction . Data for placebo - treated patients are shown for reference . CD Crohn’s disease , Q quartile , UC ulcerative colitis . Figure reproduced from Rosario et al . [ 48 ] ( ( c ) Oxford University Press ) , with permission of Oxford University Press 1296 M . Rosario et al . relationships were further explored using logistic regres - sion . Results from the logistic regression analysis con - ﬁrmed the positive exposure – efﬁcacy relationships for clinical remission and response at week 6 [ 48 ] . On aver - age , patients with higher baseline albumin concentrations , lower baseline fecal calprotectin concentrations , and no prior TNF - a antagonist use had a higher probability of clinical remission and response whether they were receiv - ing placebo or vedolizumab . Of these covariates , prior TNF - a antagonist use had the largest effect on the proba - bility of efﬁcacy ; the probability of clinical remission at week 6 was approximately 10 % higher for patients who were naı¨ve to TNF - a antagonists than for patients who had not responded to this treatment . Vedolizumab concentra - tion was determined to be the strongest factor affecting clinical remission and response rates in patients with UC . After adjusting for confounding factors , increasing the cumulative average concentration through week 6 ( C aver - age ) from 35 to 84 l g / mL was associated with a 15 % increase in the probability of clinical remission and a 20 % increase in the probability of clinical response at week 6 . Consistent with positive exposure – efﬁcacy relationships in patients with UC , the median vedolizumab trough serum concentration at week 6 was higher in remitters [ 34 . 7 ( 95 % conﬁdence interval ( CI ) 31 . 7 – 36 . 6 ) l g / mL ] than in non - remitters [ 23 . 7 ( 22 . 0 – 24 . 8 ) l g / mL ] and also in responders [ 29 . 0 ( 27 . 3 – 31 . 7 ) l g / mL ] than in non - responders [ 21 . 5 ( 20 . 1 – 23 . 3 ) l g / mL ] , although some overlap in concentra - tions was observed between the subgroups [ 48 ] . 6 . 2 Patients with CD The exposure – efﬁcacy relationships of vedolizumab in patients with CD in the GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 studies were also assessed by analyzing the clinical remission and response rates by trough concentration quartile . Similar to the GEMINI 1 analysis , any confounding factors for baseline covariates were assessed using logistic regression [ 12 , 25 ] . Clinical remission was deﬁned as a CDAI score B 150 points , and clinical response was deﬁned as a decrease from baseline in CDAI score C 70 points . From the quartile analyses , a modest , positive exposure – response relationship was evident for vedolizumab induc - tion therapy , which was shallower than that observed for patients with UC . Vedolizumab concentrations [ 16 . 0 l g / mL in GEMINI 2 and [ 17 . 1 l g / mL in GEMINI 3 at week 6 were associated with higher rates of clinical remission than those observed with placebo ( Fig . 5b , c ) . From concentration quartile 1 to quartile 4 , the absolute rate increase for clinical remission was approximately 14 % in GEMINI 2 and only approximately 5 % in GEMINI 3 at week 6 ( Fig . 5b , c ) [ 48 ] . However , at week 10 , the abso - lute rate increase from quartile 1 to quartile 4 was approximately 22 % for clinical remission in GEMINI 3 ( Fig . 5d ) . These results may be a reﬂection of the fact that a higher percentage of patients with prior TNF - a antagonist failure were enrolled in GEMINI 3 than in GEMINI 2 ( 76 versus 58 % ) [ 12 , 13 ] , possibly representing a more treat - ment - refractory group of patients who may need a greater exposure of vedolizumab or more time to achieve remis - sion than TNF - a antagonist - naı¨ve patients . From the logistic regression analysis , which accounted for baseline covariate effects , patients from GEMINI 2 with higher baseline albumin concentrations , lower CRP concentrations , and no prior TNF - a antagonist use , on average , had a higher probability of clinical remission and response whether they were receiving placebo or vedoli - zumab [ 48 ] . Similar to the results for patients with UC , prior TNF - a antagonist use had the largest effect on the probability of efﬁcacy ( 10 % higher probability of clinical remission for treatment - naı¨ve patients ) . After adjusting for covariates , increasing C average from 32 to 85 l g / mL cor - responded to an approximate 10 % increase in the proba - bility of clinical remission and 15 % increase in the probability of clinical response at week 6 . Consistent with these results , the median vedolizumab trough concentration at week 6 was higher in remitters [ 26 . 8 ( 95 % CI 24 . 9 – 30 . 1 ) l g / mL ] than in non - remitters [ 23 . 5 ( 22 . 4 – 24 . 8 ) l g / mL ] and also in responders [ 26 . 8 ( 25 . 2 – 27 . 7 ) l g / mL ] than in non - responders [ 22 . 1 ( 20 . 5 – 23 . 4 ) l g / mL ] in GEMINI 2 [ 48 ] . However , the overlap in concentrations between the subgroups was greater than for patients with UC from GEMINI 1 . Several factors may have contributed to the shallower exposure – efﬁcacy relationships apparent in patients with CD than in patients with UC . Clinical remission rates were higher at week 10 than at week 6 in GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 , particularly for patients who had previously not responded to TNF - a antagonist therapy [ 13 , 51 ] . This observation is reﬂected in the European prescribing information , which states that patients with CD who have not responded to vedolizumab therapy by week 6 may be given an additional dose at week 10 before being assessed for an induction response at week 14 [ 8 ] . The exposure – efﬁcacy relationships may have been steeper for patients with CD had a timepoint later than week 6 been evaluated . The steeper exposure – efﬁcacy relationship for clinical remission evident for patients from GEMINI 3 at week 10 than at week 6 supports this hypothesis [ 48 ] . 7 Vedolizumab Immunogenicity The immunogenicity of vedolizumab was characterized throughout the clinical development program using screening and titration assays followed by a neutralizing Clinical Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics , and Immunogenicity of Vedolizumab 1297 assay . The screening assay was a validated bridging assay designed to detect the presence of ADAs in serum . In the presence of vedolizumab , low - titer responses were often undetectable [ 1 l g / mL of drug interfered with low and moderate levels of the control rabbit anti - vedolizumab antibodies ( AVAs ) ] . For this reason , in the phase III GEMINI studies , a two - prong approach was taken to ensure all individuals with AVAs were identiﬁed . First , the assay was run using two dilutions ( 1 : 5 and 1 : 50 ) and both had to be negative to be considered negative in the assay . The dilutions were used to increase the likelihood of an interaction between the detecting reagent and the AVA , and not the drug . The second approach was to take a sample at a timepoint where drug levels had cleared below interference levels , i . e . , samples were also taken when the patients were off drug . After the initial screening assay , positive samples were conﬁrmed with a titration assay . In the GEMINI studies , samples conﬁrmed as ADA positive were further examined for their ability to neutralize vedolizumab activity . 7 . 1 Rate of Anti - Drug Antibody Development In the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 combined population , 56 of 1434 ( 4 % ) patients who were treated continuously with vedolizumab for up to 52 weeks were ADA positive at any time during treatment ( including the ﬁnal safety visit ) ; nine of these patients ( 0 . 6 % ) were persistently positive ( positive at two or more consecutive visits ) and 33 ( 2 . 3 % ) developed neutralizing antibodies [ 52 ] . None of the nine persistently positive patients achieved clinical remission at weeks 6 or 52 [ 7 ] . As frequently occurs with monoclonal antibodies , the rate of immunogenicity during vedolizumab treatment may have been underestimated . Consistent with this possibility , among the 320 patients who were treated continuously with vedolizumab for up to 52 weeks in GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 and who had data available at the ﬁnal safety visit ( week 66 ) , 32 ( 10 % ) patients were ADA positive when off drug [ 52 ] . While there was an increase in the overall immunogenicity rate off drug compared with on drug , when we examined the impact of the immunogenicity using either the 4 % population or the 10 – 15 % population , there was no signiﬁcant difference between the populations with or without AVAs , suggesting that the impact of immunogenicity was adequately captured . The increase in the immunogenicity rate off drug com - pared with on drug suggests that low - to moderate - titer AVAs may have been present and unobservable . However , when comparing the results of the impact of AVAs on clinical safety , efﬁcacy , and pharmacological parameters , only the presence of persistently positive samples resulted in any impact . An effect of concomitant immunomodulator therapy on the rate of ADA development was evident in those patients who received two doses of vedolizumab during induction and then placebo during maintenance . In the subgroup of these patients who were using immunomodulators at base - line ( regardless of other concomitant medication use ) , only one of 32 patients ( 3 % ) was ADA positive ( persistently positive ) versus 44 of 247 patients ( 18 % ) who were not using immunomodulators at baseline [ 30 patients ( 12 % ) were persistently positive ] [ 41 , 52 ] . The impact of immunomod - ulator coadministration on the rate of ADA development in patients who were administered vedolizumab continuously during induction and maintenance was less obvious , poten - tially due to a smaller percentage of patients who developed ADA in this group . A total of ﬁve of 161 patients ( 3 % ) using immunomodulators at baseline were ADA positive ( none were persistently positive ) versus 51 of 1273 patients ( 4 % ) not using immunomodulators at baseline [ nine patients ( 1 % ) were persistently positive ] [ 41 , 52 ] . 7 . 2 Safety Related to Anti - Drug Antibody Development In the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies , three of 61 patients ( 5 % ) who were treated with vedolizumab contin - uously for up to 52 weeks and who had an investigator - deﬁned infusion - related reaction were persistently ADA positive . Three of the 56 patients ( 5 % ) who were persis - tently ADA positive in these studies experienced an infu - sion - related reaction [ 52 ] . 8 Conclusions The pharmacokinetic proﬁle of vedolizumab is characterized by a rapid , saturable , non - linear elimination process at low concentrations , presumably attributed to target - mediated elimination via interaction with a 4 b 7 integrin , and a slower , linear elimination process ( non - speciﬁc elimination ) at higher concentrations ( [ 10 l g / mL ) . At therapeutic concentrations , vedolizumab is primarily eliminated through the linear path - way . The distribution pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab was best described by a two - compartment model . The t (cid:2) of vedolizumab was estimated to be 25 . 5 days . The pharma - cokinetic properties of vedolizumab were similar in patients with UC and patients with CD . Of the covariates tested , extreme low serum albumin ( \ 3 . 2 g / dL ) and extreme high body weight ( [ 120 kg ) values were identiﬁed as potential clinically important predictors of vedolizumab CL L . Vedolizumab reversibly and maximally inhibited MAdCAM - 1 - Fc binding to a 4 b 7 integrin on peripheral blood memory T cells at all doses and timepoints at which vedolizumab was measurable in serum . Once vedolizumab 1298 M . Rosario et al . was no longer detectable in serum , the inhibition of MAdCAM - 1 - Fc binding returned to baseline levels . Positive exposure – efﬁcacy relationships for vedolizu - mab induction therapy were evident for clinical remission and clinical response in patients with UC or CD . The relationships were steeper for patients with UC than for patients with CD . On average , patients with higher albu - min , lower fecal calprotectin ( UC only ) , lower CRP ( CD only ) , and no prior TNF - a antagonist use had a higher probability of remission . Prior TNF - a antagonist use had the largest effect on the probability of efﬁcacy in both diseases ( 10 % higher probability of clinical remission for treatment - naı¨ve patients ) . After adjusting for covariates , an increase in C average from 32 to 85 l g / mL corresponded to increases of approximately 15 and 10 % in the probability of clinical remission in patients with UC and patients with CD , respectively . No strong conclusions can be drawn from the exposure – efﬁcacy relationship because no dose - ranging studies have been performed . However , some patients may beneﬁt from an extra dose at week 10 . The GEMINI 1 and 2 studies reported greater than 95 % a 4 b 7 saturation on memory T cells in peripheral blood [ 11 , 12 ] , placing doubt regarding the viability of therapeutic drug monitoring for vedolizumab [ 50 ] . A proposal for a therapeutic window for vedolizumab can only be addressed and validated by a prospective study . The rate of ADA development off drug was 10 % . During treatment , a meaningful decrease in vedolizumab exposure was only observed in patients who were persis - tently ADA positive .
