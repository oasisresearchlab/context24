However , the molecular regulation of mATG9 trafficking for autophagy initiation remains unclear . Here we identified two conserved classic adaptor protein sorting signals within the cytosolic N - terminus of mATG9 , which mediate trafficking of mATG9 from the plasma membrane and trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) via interaction with the AP1 / 2 complex . Src phosphorylates mATG9 at Tyr8 to maintain its endocytic and constitutive trafficking in unstressed conditions . In response to starvation , phosphorylation of mATG9 at Tyr8 by Src and at Ser14 by ULK1 functionally cooperate to promote interactions between mATG9 and the AP1 / 2 complex , leading to redistribution of mATG9 from the plasma membrane and juxta - nuclear region to the peripheral pool for autophagy initiation . Our findings uncover novel mechanisms of mATG9 trafficking and suggest a coordination of basal and stress - induced autophagy .

In response to sub - lethal stresses , cells undergo rapid adaptive changes in their metabolism to protect themselves against poten - tial damage . This is orchestrated through a multifaceted cellular program , which involves the concerted action of diverse general and stress response pathways . One of the key pathways that mediate normal cellular homeostasis and stress - induced adaptation is macroautophagy ( here - after called autophagy ) . Autophagy is a cell survival pro - cess in which portions of the cytosol and damaged or un - wanted organelles are engulfed into a double - membrane autophagosome and delivered to the lysosomes for deg - radation and recycling [ 1 , 2 ] . The major autophagy path - way involves the activation of the ULK1 / ATG13 / FIP200 complex , the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase complex and the mATG9 cycling machinery to initiate the formation of a phagophore / isolation membrane , leading to subse - quent expansion and maturation of the autophagosome [ 3 ] . Under normal physiological conditions , autophagy is maintained at a basal homeostatic level , which is respon - sible for protein quality control and turnover of intracel - lular organelles [ 4 ] . In response to nutrient deprivation or other sub - lethal stresses , autophagy is geared up to a high flux to efficiently degrade and recycle cytoplasmic components for homeostasis and cell survival . Defects in autophagy have been causally linked with degenerative , Changqian Zhou et al . 185 www . cell - research . com | Cell Research | SPRINGER NATURE inflammatory , metabolic and neoplastic diseases [ 5 , 6 ] . Multiple membrane sources , including mitochondria [ 7 ] , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) [ 8 - 11 ] , Golgi apparatus [ 12 , 13 ] and plasma membrane [ 14 ] contribute to nascent autophagosome formation under stress conditions . Mo - bilization of these diverse membrane sources requires dynamic membrane trafficking events , including the budding of vesicles from donor membrane structures , membrane remodeling during phagophore formation , di - rectional vesicle movement , and homotypic / heterotypic fusion of vesicles during autophagosome formation and maturation . Of note , mATG9 , the only multi - spanning membrane protein in the ATG family , was found to traf - fic through the plasma membrane [ 15 ] , the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) [ 13 , 16 - 18 ] , early endosomes , late endo - somes and recycling endosomes . During starvation - in - duced autophagy , mATG9 moves from the TGN to the peripheral pool and co - localizes with endosome markers and the autophagosome marker LC3 . The redistribution of mATG9 appears to be mediated by ULK1 , as it is inhibited by ULK1 knockdown [ 17 ] . In addition , it has been reported that a sub - population of mATG9 resides on the plasma membrane and can interact with the AP2 com - plex for internalization via clathrin - mediated endocyto - sis . Internalized mATG9 traffics from early to recycling endosomes for fusion with ATG16L1 - positive structures [ 15 ] . It has been shown that two TBC domain - containing RABGAPs , TBC1D5 and TBC1D14 , are involved in regulating mATG9 trafficking and autophagosome for - mation [ 19 , 20 ] . TBC1D5 interacts with LC3 , the AP2 complex and mATG9 during autophagy , and this inter - action may function to recruit mATG9 vesicles to auto - phagic membranes . TBC1D14 , previously identified as a negative regulator of autophagy , binds to RAB11 and inhibits vesicular transport from recycling endosomes and autophagosome formation [ 21 ] . A recent report indi - cated that mATG9 trafficking is regulated by TBC1D14 and the TRAPPIII complex independently of ULK1 [ 20 ] . Recruitment of the TRAPPIII complex to tubulated recycling endosomes by TBC1D14 activates RAB1 to promote endosome - Golgi trafficking , which may recycle mATG9 to maintain autophagy flux . Despite significant progress , the exact molecular mechanisms that regulate mATG9 trafficking and coordinate upstream nutrient sensing signals with mATG9 trafficking to fine - tune autophagy flux under normal or starvation conditions remain elusive . Here , we identified two adaptor protein sorting signals within the N - terminus of mATG9 which can be recognized by the AP1 and AP2 complexes to me - diate trafficking of mATG9 from the plasma membrane and TGN . Src kinase promotes the interaction between mATG9 and AP1 / 2 complex by directly phosphorylating mATG9 at Tyr8 , and this phosphorylation is required for constitutive mATG9 trafficking . We also found that in re - sponse to starvation , phosphorylation of mATG9 at Tyr8 by Src functionally cooperates with Ser14 phosphoryla - tion by ULK1 to promote redistribution of mATG9 from the plasma membrane and juxta - nuclear region to the peripheral pool for autophagy initiation . Results The mATG9 N - terminus contains two conserved adaptor protein sorting signals To understand the mechanism underlying mATG9 trafficking , we hypothesized that mATG9 may contain specific sorting signals responsible for trafficking . We thus searched the N - and C - termini of mATG9 , which are both cytosolic , and identified two putative conserved adaptor protein ( AP ) sorting signals in the N - terminus ( Figure 1A ) . These are a tyrosine - based sorting signal Y ( 8 ) QRL ( 11 ) and a dileucine - based signal EEDL ( 25 ) L ( 26 ) . Tyrosine - based sorting signals are recognized by the mu subunit of the AP1 / 2 complexes , while dileu - cine - based sorting signals are recognized by multiple subunits of the complexes [ 22 - 24 ] . We therefore created mATG9 proteins with Y8 / L11 mutated to alanine ( SS1 ) , L25 / L26 mutated to alanine ( SS2 ) , or both mutations ( SS1 / 2 ) , and examined the interaction of mATG9 with the mu subunits from the AP1 and AP2 complexes ( Fig - ure 1B and 1C ) . Indeed , the single mutation of these two sorting signals weakened the mATG9 - AP1 / 2 complex interaction and the double mutation completely abol - ished the interaction . In vitro pull - down assays using a purified His - tagged N - terminal fragment of mATG9 ( His - ATG9N - HA , aa1 - 66 ) , wild - type or carrying a Y8A mutation , further verified the physical interactions with the mu subunits ( Supplementary information , Figure S1A and S1B ) . Immunofluorescent staining showed that mutations of the sorting signals weakened or completely abolished the juxta - nuclear distribution of mATG9 and its co - localization with TGN46 , a marker for TGN ( Fig - ure 1D - 1F ; Supplementary information , Figure S1C and S1D ) . Sorting signal mutations also impaired the co - lo - calization of mATG9 with RAB11 - positive recycling endosomes ( Supplementary information , Figure S1E and S1F ) . Hypothesizing that this dispersed localization of the SS1 / 2 mutant may occur in early endosome , we co - expressed mATG9 with a Rab5 GTPase - deficient mu - tant ( Rab5 Q79L ) , which stimulates aberrant fusion of early endosomes [ 25 ] . The result showed that the Rab5 mutant co - localized only with wild - type mATG9 , but not the SS1 / 2 mutant , ruling out the possibility of early en - dosomal localization ( Supplementary information , Fig - 186 Src kinase regulates mATG9 trafficking SPRINGER NATURE | Cell Research | Vol 27 No 2 | February 2017 Changqian Zhou et al . 187 www . cell - research . com | Cell Research | SPRINGER NATURE ure S1G and S1H ) . To further investigate whether these sorting signal mutations led to cytoplasmic localization or plasma membrane retention of mATG9 , we carried out cell surface biotinylation assays to measure the propor - tion of plasma membrane - localized mATG9 ( Figure 1G ) . The biotinylation of mATG9 was moderately enhanced by the single mutations and very strongly enhanced by the double mutation , suggesting that the mutants are retained at the plasma membrane . Consistent with this , immunogold - labeled EM analysis revealed that in cells harboring the SS1 / 2 mutation , mATG9 was retained at the plasma membrane due to a severe endocytosis defect ( Figure 1H and Supplementary information , Figure S1I ) . Thus , we identified two classic AP sorting signals in the mATG9 N - terminus and we showed that mutation of these two sorting signals leads to decreased interaction of mATG9 with AP complexes and increased retention of mATG9 at the plasma membrane . Src directly phosphorylates the mATG9 N - terminus at Tyr8 Given that mATG9 disperses from the juxta - nuclear region under starvation stress [ 17 ] , we postulated that there must be a regulatory mechanism underlying this mATG9 redistribution process . Noticing multiple phos - phorylatable residues near the AP sorting signals , we hypothesized that phosphorylation may participate in this regulation . In vitro kinase assays using the purified N - terminus of mATG9 and HEK293T cell lysates re - vealed that the mATG9 N - terminus can be phosphorylat - ed at both serine / threonine and tyrosine residues ( Figure 2A ) . We also subjected the samples to mass spectrometry analysis and confirmed that several residues near the AP sorting signals were phosphorylated ( Supplementary information , Figure S2 ) . To determine which kinases are responsible for phosphorylation of the mATG9 N - termi - nus , we performed sequence alignments and found that the Y8 residue of mATG9 is within a typical consensus phosphorylation motif for Src kinase ( Figure 2B ) [ 26 ] . Incubation of the purified mATG9 N - terminal peptide with immunoprecipitated wild - type Src - GFP and purified recombinant GST - Src kinase from Sigma , but not ki - nase - dead Src - GFP , confirms that Src kinase can directly phosphorylate the mATG9 N - terminus in vitro ( Figure 2C and 2D ) . Point mutation analysis revealed that both Y8 and Y15 of mATG9 can be phosphorylated by Src in vitro ( Figure 2E ) . Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Src interacts with mATG9 ( Figure 2F and Supple - mentary information , Figure S3A ) . Pull - down experi - ments using immobilized mATG9 N - terminal peptide re - vealed that the N - terminal region of mATG9 directly in - teracts with Src ( Figure 2G ) . To confirm that Y8 and Y15 are authentic Src kinase phosphorylation sites in vivo , we introduced the point mutations of Y8F , Y15F and Y8 / 15F into mATG9 to measure the phospho - signal when Src - GFP is overexpressed ( Figure 2H ) . The signal is much reduced in the Y8F and Y8 / 15F mutants , while the Y15F signal is similar to that of wild - type mATG9 . These data suggested that mATG9 is mainly phosphorylated by Src at Y8 , although additional Src phosphorylation sites may exist . Src phosphorylates mATG9 at Y8 to promote its constitu - tive trafficking We next examined whether phosphorylation of Y8 by Src kinase is of functional importance in regulating the trafficking of mATG9 . We first generated and verified a specific antibody recognizing the phosphorylated state of Y8 ( Supplementary information , Figure S3B ) . Y8 of mATG9 is phosphorylated under normal unstressed con - ditions in vivo ( Figure 3A ) , and this phosphorylation is decreased upon treatment with the Src inhibitors or Src Figure 1 The mATG9 N - terminus contains two conserved adaptor protein sorting signals .

Ectopic expression of wild - type Src further en - hances the phosphorylation of Y8 , whereas kinase - dead Src inhibits the phosphorylation ( Figure 3A ) . We then asked whether this phosphorylation of mATG9 affects its interaction with the AP1 / 2 complexes and subsequent trafficking . As shown in Figure 3C and 3D , ectopic ex - pression of wild - type Src , but not kinase - dead Src , was able to enhance the interaction between mATG9 and the AP1 / 2 complexes . More importantly , this enhancement was blocked by the Y8F mutation of mATG9 ( Figure 3E and 3F ) . As Y8 is highly phosphorylated under nor - mal conditions , we checked the interactions between the AP1 / 2 complex mu subunits and wild - type mATG9 or the Y8F mutant under normal culture conditions . We found that Y8F weakened the interaction ( Figure 3G ) . To Changqian Zhou et al . 189 www . cell - research . com | Cell Research | SPRINGER NATURE 190 Src kinase regulates mATG9 trafficking SPRINGER NATURE | Cell Research | Vol 27 No 2 | February 2017 rule out the possibility that the Y8F mutation of mATG9 may change the conformation of the sorting signal , we used synthesized peptides of mATG9 ( aa1 - 18 ) phos - phorylated or unphosphorylated at Y8 for competitive binding of AP1 / 2 complex mu subunits in vitro ( Supple - mentary information , Figure S3D and S3E ) . The results revealed that phosphorylated peptide at Y8 has a stronger affinity with AP1 / 2 complex mu subunits compared with unphosphorylated peptide . Similarly , the Src inhibitors PP2 or SU6656 reduced the interactions ( Figure 3H and 3I ) . However , the Y8F mutant of mATG9 was not sensitive to PP2 or SU6656 treatment ( Supplementary information , Figure S3F ) , suggesting that the phosphor - ylation at Y8 by Src promotes the interaction of mATG9 with AP1 / 2 complex . Immunostaining analysis showed that ectopic expression of Src drives the spreading of wild - type mATG9 , but not the SS1 / 2 or Y8F mutants , from the juxta - nuclear region , while ectopic expression of kinase - dead Src caused partial retention of wild - type mATG9 on the plasma membrane ( Figure 3J ) . Taken together , these data showed that Src can phosphorylate mATG9 at Y8 under normal conditions and promote con - stitutive mATG9 trafficking . Stimulation of Src kinase activity by EGF enhances mATG9 retrograde trafficking Src can be activated in response to stimulation of var - ious cell surface receptor - mediated signaling pathways including the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) pathway [ 27 ] . We next tested whether hEGF stimula - tion regulates mATG9 phosphorylation and trafficking . In response to hEGF stimulation , phosphorylation of mATG9 at Y8 was significantly increased immediately after the activation of Src ( Figure 4A and Supplemen - tary information , Figure S3G ) . hEGF treatment rapidly enhanced the interaction of mATG9 with the AP2 com - plex , but not the AP1 complex , suggesting that mATG9 is trafficked from the plasma membrane by endocytic transport in response to hEGF stimulation ( Figure 4B and Supplementary information , Figure S3H ) . We further hypothesized that stimulation of Src kinase with hEGF treatment may affect mATG9 trafficking and distribution by phosphorylation of Y8 . To address this question , we generated an Atg9a - knockout ( KO ) HeLa cell line using the CRISPR / Cas9 system , and stably reintroduced wild - type mATG9 or the Y8F and SS1 / 2 mutants into the KO cells ( Supplementary information , Figure S3I - S3K ) . Af - ter serum - starving the cells for 24 h and stimulating them with hEGF for different lengths of time , we monitored mATG9 trafficking and distribution . As shown in Fig - ure 4C , mATG9 was dispersed in serum - starved Atg9a KO HeLa cells stably reconstituted with mATG9 - Myc . In response to hEGF stimulation , mATG9 was partially localized to the plasma membrane , and was then inter - nalized together with EGFR before finally recovering its juxta - nuclear localization . In the case of the SS1 / 2 mutant , neither serum starvation nor hEGF treatment affected the plasma membrane retention of mATG9 ( Fig - ure 4D ) . Interestingly , cells reconstituted with the Y8F mutant showed an intermediate phenotype between the cells reconstituted with wild - type mATG9 and SS1 / 2 ; they were partially resistant to hEGF stimulation ( Figure 4E ) , whereas the internalization of EGFR was not affect - ed . These findings indicated that the phosphorylation of Y8 by Src kinase is essential for retrograde trafficking and juxta - nuclear localization of mATG9 following EGF stimulation or under unstressed condition . ULK1 directly phosphorylates mATG9 at S14 to promote its trafficking under starvation stress Under starvation stress , mATG9 redistributes from the TGN to endosomes in a ULK1 - dependent manner [ 17 ] . ULK1 is a serine / threonine kinase that is essential for initiation of autophagy . The redistribution of mATG9 is also important for autophagy initiation , although the pre - cise regulatory mechanism is not clear . We thus wished to investigate whether ULK1 regulates mATG9 traffick - ing via a sorting signal - based mechanism during starva - Figure 3 Src phosphorylates mATG9 at Y8 to promote constitutive trafficking of mATG9 .

By sequence alignment , we found that the S14 res - idue of mATG9 lies within a consensus phosphorylation motif for ULK1 kinase ( Figure 5A ) [ 28 ] . In vitro kinase assays showed that wild - type ULK1 but not kinase - dead ULK1 can directly phosphorylate the purified mATG9 N - terminal peptide ( Figure 5B ) . We individually mutat - ed the three serine residues in the mATG9 N - terminal peptide and found that only the S14A mutation abrogates the phospho - signal , which suggests that S14 is the spe - cific phosphorylation site for ULK1 kinase ( Figure 5C ) . Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ULK1 interacts with mATG9 ( Figure 5D ) . Using two different inhibitors , Wortmannin ( PI3K inhibitor ) and BA1 ( lyso - some inhibitor ) , we blocked EBSS starvation - induced autophagy at the early and late stage , respectively , and found that the interaction between mATG9 and ULK1 was dramatically enhanced at the early stage , suggesting that phosphorylation of mATG9 by ULK1 is of func - tional importance for autophagy initiation . Pull - down experiments revealed direct interaction of in vitro trans - lated ULK1 protein with the purified mATG9 N - terminal peptide ( Figure 5E ) . We next investigated the functional consequence of S14 phosphorylation on mATG9 redis - tribution and autophagy initiation . We first generated a specific antibody recognizing the phosphorylated state of S14 ( Supplementary information , Figure S4A ) and showed that ectopic expression of wild - type ULK1 , but not a kinase - dead mutant , enhanced the phosphorylation of S14 ( Figure 5F ) . Unlike Y8 , which is highly phos - phorylated under normal unstressed conditions , S14 of mATG9 showed a relatively low level of phosphorylation ( Figure 5F ) . Upon EBSS treatment , the phosphorylation of S14 is drastically increased , whereas the phosphory - lation of Y8 is relatively stable ( Figure 5G and Supple - mentary information , Figure S4B ) . Knockout of Ulk1 using the CRISPR / Cas9 system in HeLa cells abolished S14 , but not Y8 , phosphorylation of mATG9 , further supporting our notion that ULK1 is responsible for S14 phosphorylation under starvation ( Figure 5H and Supple - mentary information , Figure S4C ) . We next speculated that phosphorylation by ULK1 may promote the redistri - bution of mATG9 from the plasma membrane and TGN to endosomes in response to starvation . We thus intro - duced the non - phosphorylatable S14A mutant of mATG9 into HEK293T cells and examined the interaction of mATG9 with the AP1 / 2 complexes in the presence of ectopically expressed wild - type ULK1 or kinase - dead ULK1 ( Figure 5I and 5J ) . Wild - type ULK1 , but not the kinase - dead form , significantly enhanced the mATG9 - AP1 / 2 complex interaction , whereas the enhancement was partially blocked in S14A mutant . In contrast to Y8 , the S14A mutation of mATG9 did not reduce the interac - tion between mATG9 and the AP1 / 2 complex due to the relatively low level of S14 phosphorylation under normal conditions ( Supplementary information , Figure S4D ) . Previous work reported that starvation stress caused redistribution of mATG9 from the TGN to peripheral en - dosome membranes in a ULK1 - dependent manner [ 17 ] . Accordingly , we found that EBSS starvation enhanced the mATG9 - AP1 / 2 complex interaction and the mATG9 S14A mutation impaired this enhancement ( Figure 5K and 5L ) . We also stably reintroduced wild - type mATG9 or the S14A mutant into Atg9a KO HeLa cells and treat - ed the cells with EBSS starvation . Wild - type mATG9 dispersed quickly in response to EBSS treatment , where - as the S14A mutant showed prolonged juxta - nuclear localization and delayed redistribution ( Supplementary information , Figure S4E ) . Based on these results , we conclude that ULK1 phosphorylates mATG9 at S14 to promote mATG9 trafficking and redistribution from the plasma membrane and TGN to endosomes in response to starvation stress . Phosphorylation of Y8 and S14 functionally cooperates to regulate mATG9 trafficking and redistribution Since Y8 and S14 are phosphorylated by Src and ULK1 , respectively , under starvation stress in vivo ( Fig - ure 5G and 5H ) , we next addressed how they function - ally cooperate to regulate mATG9 trafficking . Ectopic expression of Src or ULK1 kinase alone enhances the mATG9 - AP1 / 2 complex interaction , with ULK1 having a greater effect than Src ( Figure 6A and 6B ; Supplemen - tary information , Figure S5A and S5B ) . Co - expression of Src and ULK1 kinases markedly promotes the mATG9 - AP1 / 2 complex interaction , suggesting that they have a synergistic effect . As expected , this enhancement of the mATG9 - AP1 / 2 complex interaction was blocked by double mutation of the phosphorylation sites Y8F / S14A ( designated FA ) of mATG9 ( Figure 6C ) . As shown in Figure 5H , the phosphorylation of Y8 was not evident - ly altered in Ulk1 KO cells . We anticipated that these two sites are phosphorylated by separate processes , but once phosphorylated , the sites cooperate to enhance the mATG9 - AP1 / 2 complex interaction . To further clarify this , we ectopically expressed ULK1 alone , and inves - tigated the mATG9 - AP1 / 2 complex interaction in the presence of wild - type mATG9 , the Y8 mutant ( which has a normal S14 residue ) and the Y8F / S14A double mutant ( Figure 6D ) . The result showed that the basal level of in - teraction was strongly reduced by Y8F and abolished by Y8F / S14A . The ULK1 - induced interaction enhancement was reduced by Y8F and greatly reduced by Y8F / S14A . Similar results were observed in cells that were starved in EBSS to induce activation of ULK1 ( Figure 6E ) .

( K , L ) HeLa cells were co - transfected with WT mATG9 or the S14A mutant and 3 × Flag - AP1 / 2M1 for 24 h , and then starved in EBSS for 2 h . Cells were collected for immunoprecipitation with anti - Flag antibody . See also Supplementary information , Figure S4 . vious report demonstrated that internalized mATG9 sub - sequently interacts with the RabGAP protein TBC1D5 to promote autophagy initiation [ 19 ] . We thus examined the interaction of mATG9 with TBC1D5 in cells with ectopic expression of Src or ULK1 ( Supplementary information , Figure S5C - S5F ) . As expected , wild - type Src or ULK1 , but not the kinase - dead forms , enhanced the interaction of mATG9 with TBC1D5 , and the phosphorylation site mutants blocked their interaction . Notably , co - expression of Src and ULK1 kinases markedly increased this inter - action ( Figure 6F ) . Based on these results , we propose that mATG9 is phosphorylated at Y8 under normal con - ditions to sustain its constitutive trafficking between the TGN , plasma membrane and endosomes . In response to starvation , ULK1 is activated to phosphorylate mATG9 at S14 . The phosphorylation at both sites of mATG9 syn - ergistically promotes mATG9 - AP1 / 2 complex interaction and accelerates the extrusion of mATG9 vesicles from the plasma membrane and TGN to initiate autophagy . Phosphorylation of both Y8 and S14 is essential for auto - phagy initiation It has been assumed that mATG9 may play a role in lipid or protein delivery for nascent autophagosome formation during autophagy initiation [ 29 ] . We thus ex - amined whether the phosphorylation of these two sites is required for autophagy regulation . Cells pretreated with the Src inhibitor PP2 showed fewer LC3 dots and lower autophagy flux in response to EBSS starvation ( Figure 7A and 7B ) . Consistent with this , western blotting analy - sis also confirmed that the Src inhibitors PP2 or SU6656 reduced LC3 - II conversion and autophagy flux during starvation - induced autophagy ( Figure 7C and Supple - mentary information , Figure S6A ) . To confirm the role of Src kinase in autophagy , we transfected HeLa cells with Src siRNA and measured autophagy flux . The results showed that knockdown of Src kinase led to inhibition of autophagy induction and flux ( Supplementary infor - mation , Figure S6B ) . To further study the specific func - tion of the mATG9 phosphorylation , we reintroduced the phosphorylation site mutants into Atg9a KO HeLa cells and measured autophagy flux when the cells were starved in EBSS in the presence of the lysosome inhib - itor BA1 ( Figure 7D and 7E ) . As expected , the number of LC3 dots markedly decreased in Atg9a KO cells com - pared with wild - type cells . The formation of LC3 dots was fully rescued in Atg9a KO cells by reconstitution with wild - type mATG9 , but not the AP sorting signal mutant SS1 / 2 or the phosphorylation site mutants Y8F , S14A and FA ( Y8F / S14A ) . In addition , western blotting analysis revealed that compared with the parental HeLa cells , LC3 - I and the autophagy substrate P62 accumu - lated in Atg9a KO HeLa cells under normal conditions , suggesting that basal autophagy is defective ( Figure 7F , Supplementary information , Figure S6C and S6E ) . The mRNA level of P62 showed no significant alteration ( Supplementary information , Figure S6D ) . The basal au - tophagy defect was rescued by reconstitution with wild - type mATG9 , but not the AP sorting signal mutant SS1 / 2 , or the phosphorylation site mutants Y8F , S14A and FA . In the presence of BA1 , Atg9a KO HeLa cells reconsti - tuted with the mATG9 mutants SS1 / 2 , Y8F , S14A and FA exhibited a decrease in LC3 - II conversion and autophagy flux compared with the parental HeLa cells or wild - type mATG9 - reconstituted KO cells upon EBSS treatment ( Figure 7F and Supplementary information , S6F ) . We also treated these cells with mTORC1 inhibitors , Torin1 or Rapamycin . Similar results were obtained with EBSS treatment , suggesting that these stimuli share the same mechanism for mATG9 regulation and autophagy induc - Changqian Zhou et al . 195 www . cell - research . com | Cell Research | SPRINGER NATURE 196 Src kinase regulates mATG9 trafficking SPRINGER NATURE | Cell Research | Vol 27 No 2 | February 2017 Figure 6 Phosphorylation of Y8 and S14 cooperates to regulate mATG9 trafficking and redistribution .

Together , these data suggested that the phosphorylation of mATG9 at Y8 and S14A are both essential for basal and starva - tion - induced autophagy . Discussion Sorting signals and mATG9 trafficking One of our major findings is the identification of two sorting signals which are critical for mATG9 trafficking . These signals are recognized by the AP1 / 2 complexes for directional movement of mATG9 from the plasma membrane and TGN . Double mutation of the sorting signals led to plasma membrane , but not TGN , retention of mATG9 , suggesting that the interactions of the sort - ing signals with the AP1 / 2 complexes are essential for endocytic trafficking . Our results also support the idea that the plasma membrane is one of the primary mem - brane sources for autophagy , thus helping to answer the longstanding question of how diverse membrane sources contribute to autophagosome formation . Recently , Imai et al . [ 30 ] also identified the mAtg9 sorting motif at its N - terminus , which mediated mATG9 traffic by interac - tion with AP2 , consistent with our results . Our results also extend a recent report showing that TBC1D5 and the AP2 complex directly interact with ATG9 to facilitate its endocytic trafficking [ 19 ] . Sequence alignments show that the sorting signals and the phosphorylation sites are highly conserved in mammals , suggesting that our newly characterized regulatory mechanism is likely to be wide - ly used for mATG9 trafficking and autophagy initiation . It is also possible that ATG9 in yeast is regulated by the same mechanisms , and further experimental work is war - ranted to investigate this . Src kinase in constitutive mATG9 trafficking and basal autophagy It has long been observed that mATG9 traffics be - tween the plasma membrane , the TGN , endosomes , and newly formed autophagosomes in response to autoph - agy - induced stresses [ 13 , 15 , 17 , 31 - 34 ] . It is thus of fundamental importance to understand the mechanism underlying mATG9 trafficking , because it is essential for autophagosome formation , and for normal cellular functions and stress responses . The finding that Src phos - phorylates mATG9 at Tyr8 to regulate constitutive endo - cytic mATG9 trafficking is somewhat unexpected . Tyr8 phosphorylation promotes the interaction of mATG8 with AP1 / 2 complexes , which are known mediators of endocytosis and membrane trafficking , to sustain recy - cling transport and juxta - nuclear localization of mATG9 under normal unstressed condition . Our results are consistent with a large body of literatures showing that Src plays essential roles in endocytosis and membrane trafficking [ 35 ] . Src is able to phosphorylate multiple endocytic molecules including clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) , dynamin 1 / 2 and cortactin for constitutive EGF or transferrin uptake [ 36 - 40 ] . Importantly , we found that engagement of EGF with its receptor activates Src kinase to promote mATG9 trafficking . Engagement of ligands by various receptors ( including integrin receptors , G - pro - tein - coupled receptors , antigen - and Fc - coupled recep - tors , cytokine receptors and steroid hormone receptors ) is able to activate Src kinase , which in turn regulates the functional activity of receptors and downstream events [ 35 ] . This places Src at a unique and important position to receive or transmit both extracellular and intracellular signals . We found that Atg9a KO cells reconstituted with Y8F mutant of mATG9 showed accumulation of type I LC3 and autophagy substrate P62 under normal un - stressed condition , indicating defective basal autophagy . As we used EGF as a treatment for activating Src and promoting the retrograde transport of mATG9 , our data thus imply that these signaling pathways including EGFR pathway may also regulate constitutive and basal levels of autophagy by regulating mATG9 distribution via Src kinase . A recent elegant report from Anderson’s group showed that knockdown of EGFR inhibited basal and se - rum starvation - induced autophagy flux , suggesting a role of EGFR in sustaining basal autophagy in a kinase - inde - pendent fashion [ 41 ] . It is also reported that EGFR can phosphorylate Beclin1 directly to inhibit autophagy flux Changqian Zhou et al . 197 www . cell - research . com | Cell Research | SPRINGER NATURE 198 Src kinase regulates mATG9 trafficking SPRINGER NATURE | Cell Research | Vol 27 No 2 | February 2017 Figure 7 Phosphorylation of both Y8 and S14 is essential for autophagy initiation . ( A ) U2OS cells were transfected with GFP - LC3 for 24 h , then treated with or without EBSS for 2 h in the presence or absence of the Src inhibitor PP2 ( 10 µ M ) and the lysosome inhibitor BA1 ( Bafilomycin A1 , 20 nM ) .

( G ) Schematic diagram showing the reg - ulation of mATG9 trafficking and autophagy initiation under normal unstressed and starvation conditions . Under normal con - ditions , mATG9 is phosphorylated by Src at Y8 to sustain its constitutive trafficking and juxta - nuclear localization . In response to starvation stress , mATG9 is phosphorylated at Y8 by Src and at S14 by ULK1 to synergistically promote redistribution of mATG9 from the plasma membrane and TGN to endosomes for autophagy initiation . [ 42 ] . These dual roles of EGFR may be fine - tuned by Src kinase to sustain autophagy at a low but basal level ( in which high autophagy flux is inhibited ) and at high flux when ULK1 is activated . Further studies are needed to understand the complex and mutual regulation of the dis - tinct kinases in autophagy regulation in normal and stress conditions . Recent reports showed that active Src kinase forms a complex with LC3B , a known autophagy cargo receptor [ 43 ] . Specific autophagic degradation of active Src enables the cell to fine - tune its cellular activities . This reciprocal regulation of Src and autophagy may be important for precisely adjusting the cellular response to cope with environmental and cellular cues and stresses . Cooperation of Src and ULK1 in mATG9 trafficking and autophagy Both basal and stress - induced autophagy are import - ant for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis [ 6 ] . Our data suggest that , while Src phosphorylation of mATG9 is important for basal and constitutive autophagy , ULK1 phosphorylation of mATG9 at S14 is critical for mATG9 trafficking and initiation of stress - induced autophagy . Phosphorylation at Y8 by Src promotes the interaction mATG9 with the AP1 / 2 complexes , which may be im - portant for constitutive trafficking and basal autophagy . Importantly , Src and ULK1 collaborate to synergisti - cally enhance mATG9 trafficking , which suggests that constitutive mATG9 trafficking and basal autophagy are orchestrated to deliver a graded response to cellular and environmental cues ( Figure 7G ) . Studies from Tooze’s group showed that mATG9 trafficking can be regulated by p38MAPK [ 44 ] . It will be interesting to investigate whether mATG9 is a direct substrate of these kinases . It is possible that phosphorylation of mATG9 at distinct sites by different kinases regulates its trafficking or the initiation of autophagy . ULK1 could also regulate my - osin II activation by phosphorylating ZIPK , which is essential for mATG9 trafficking after budding from TGN [ 45 ] . It should be noted that , besides autophagy , these signaling molecules are involved in regulating numerous cellular processes including nutrient uptake , cellular me - tabolism , cell cycle and growth control , cell fate determi - nation and cellular survival / death programs . Our findings thus demonstrate a close integration between signals that regulate these cellular processes and those that regulate autophagy . Taken together , our study has advanced our understanding of autophagic regulation , and its precise links to other cellular processes await further explora - tion .
