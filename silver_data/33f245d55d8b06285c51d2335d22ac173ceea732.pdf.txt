The objective of this study is to evaluate the processes and outcomes associated with a novel in - home COVID - 19 vaccination program aimed at vaccinating high - risk populations in New York , USA . Methods : To evaluate program processes , we described the program itself and reﬂected on some key lessons learned . To evaluate program outcomes , we analyzed data reported by vaccine recipients . These outcomes included the percentage of vaccine recipients that successfully received the full course of vaccinations , and the demographic and health characteristics of vaccine recipients . We additionally assessed demographic differences in motivations for receiving in - home care , using chi - squared tests to assess statistical signiﬁcance . Data were collected and reported via dynamic online intake forms . Results : The median age of vaccine recipients was 79 ± SD 9 . 0 years . The oldest vaccine recipient was 107 years old . Of those with non - missing data , more than half of vaccine recipients were female ( 63 % ) , identiﬁed as part of a racial / ethnic minority ( 66 % ) , reported an annual income of < $ 25 , 000 ( 58 % ) , and received a high school degree or less ( 68 % ) . Most vaccine recipients reported having one or more health conditions associated with increased risk of severe COVID - 19 disease ( 72 % ) . Vaccine recipients were most likely to report receiving in - home vaccination because they were home - bound due to disability . Motivations for receiving in - home vaccination differed by demographic subgroup . Conclusion : The population receiving vaccinations from this in - home care delivery program comprised seniors who were mostly female and non - white , indicated socioeconomic vulnerability , and reported one or more COVID - related health conditions ; this signiﬁed that the program met its goal of vaccinating those most at risk for severe COVID - 19 disease . KEYWORDS COVID - 19 , vaccine , older adults , vulnerable populations , in - home care FrontiersinPublicHealth 01 frontiersin . org Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 898787 Introduction The continued emergence of new COVID - 19 variants such as Omicron ( B . 1 . 1 . 529 ) and Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) highlights the importance of vaccination as the best public health measure to reduce disease transmission and burden ( 1 ) . To mitigate the especially high risk of severe COVID - 19 disease in US adults 65 years and older , the Centers for Disease Control urgently recommend vaccination and boosters , which have been 95 % eﬀective in reducing hospitalization in the elderly population ( 2 ) . However , individuals in this population are also more likely to face age - related vaccination barriers . Digital access barriers can both limit their access to healthcare resources and hinder their ability to register for a vaccine appointment ( 3 ) , which can be challenging regardless of age ( 4 ) . In addition to digital access barriers , seniors are also more likely to have health conditions that increase risk of severe COVID - 19 disease ( 5 , 6 ) . Research shows that by the fall of 2021 , vaccination rates for older adults plateaued at around 80 % ( 7 ) . While the reasons for this gap are complex , experts believe that a hospital - centric healthcare system that inherently reduces resources that could otherwise be allocated for care in alternative settings are ill - equipped to support seniors experiencing mobility and other age - related challenges ( 8 ) . Vulnerable subpopulations that comprise the wider group of older adults , such as racial / ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities , are also at disproportionately high risk of disease transmission and burden ( 9 ) . Consequently , these increased risks may prompt concerns among vulnerable seniors about receiving vaccinations in public settings such as hospitals and pharmacies . Further , vaccination sites may be less easily accessible to high - risk subpopulations overall ( 10 ) . Altogether , these barriers are likely to prevent those at highest risk for severe illness and death from receiving a vaccine in a timely manner . More broadly , sex , race , and economic disparities in inﬂuenza and human papillomavirus vaccination have been observed ( 11 , 12 ) . In order to mitigate potential inequities in COVID - 19 vaccination , key public health and medical stakeholders have called for vaccine distribution eﬀorts to prioritize vulnerable groups . Previously identiﬁed solutions include : simplifying the registration process , prioritizing of areas most severely aﬀected by COVID - 19 and with high indexes of economic hardship , partnering with local organizations , and assisting those with mobility barriers ( 13 ) . In - home visits have been proposed as one way to help vaccinate community - dwelling older adults with mobility issues ( 3 , 14 ) . Evaluations of pre - pandemic programs designed to vaccinate seniors against the ﬂu and other viruses in their own homes indicate that such initiatives can be successful in increasing vaccination rates ( 15 – 17 ) . Indeed , policymakers have signaled support : in 2021 , the Department of Health and Human services issued a brief cataloging concerns around barriers preventing homebound seniors from accessing COVID - 19 vaccines ( 18 ) , and Medicare increased reimbursement for in - home COVID - 19 vaccinations ( 19 ) . Though literature on the design and execution of COVID - 19 in - home vaccination programs is emerging ( 20 , 21 ) , formal evaluations have been scarce , and despite calls to collect vaccine recipients’ demographic information in order to ensure that those receiving vaccines match those with the highest COVID burden ( 13 ) , there is limited data whether in - home vaccination initiatives were successful in reaching those who belong to multiple demographic groups that compound their access barriers and risk proﬁle . The objective of this study was to evaluate whether an in - home COVID - 19 vaccination program met its goal of vaccinating high - risk , high - burden populations by reﬂecting on lessons learned from a program evaluation standpoint and by conducting a formal analysis of the demographic and health - related data collected from vaccine recipients . The latter involved : ( 1 ) describing the demographic and health characteristics of adults enrolled in the program , and ( 2 ) reporting on motivations for seeking or receiving in - home care as an alternative to traditional vaccination sites , and how motivations might diﬀer by age , sex , and racial / ethnic groups . Materials and methods Overview of program During the phased COVID - 19 vaccine roll - out period ( February to May 2021 ) , Ro , a healthcare technology company based in New York , NY , USA , worked with the New York State Department of Health ( NYS DOH ) to implement a novel in - home vaccination program for adults aged 65 years and older . Together , Ro and NYS DOH identiﬁed Yonkers , a county with a high proportion of seniors and ethnic minorities , as a high priority area for residents to receive vaccinations . Outside of New York City , Yonkers had reported one of the highest COVID - 19 caseloads in New York in March 2020 ( 22 ) . Eligible community members were made aware of the program via community outreach . In order to simplify the enrollment process , age and county of residence were the only inclusion criteria . Clinical support and vaccine recipient safety Prior to scheduling their appointments , vaccine recipients were screened for contraindications and allergies . Throughout the program , vaccine recipients had access to easy - to - understand education materials about COVID - 19 vaccine side eﬀects and adverse event ( AE ) management . For ongoing FrontiersinPublicHealth 02 frontiersin . org Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 898787 support , Ro’s nurse hotline was available for vaccine recipients to ask questions regarding the vaccine , vaccination process , and potential side eﬀects . NYS - licensed registered nurses and pharmacists were recruited as vaccinators . All vaccinators were required to be fully vaccinated prior to starting in - home visits . Live training sessions and weekly check - ins were instituted to communicate the clinical protocols and processes of the in - home visit . Trainings included modules on AE reporting , technological aspects of care delivery , and administering contingency doses . A dedicated , full - time ﬁeld operations team provided ongoing , immediate communication with vaccinators in the ﬁeld . An on - call board - certiﬁed physician was available for escalation of AE reporting . Appointment scheduling The program’s technological infrastructure was designed so that appointments could be scheduled by eligible individuals or , if digital literacy was a challenge , by their caregivers . To further ensure we reached those with digital access / literacy challenges , Ro and NYS DOH worked with the Yonkers Mayor’s Oﬃce and YOFA to engage family members , caregivers , and guardians to sign up and coordinate appointments on behalf of eligible vaccine recipients . YOFA managed outreach to other local organizations that were able to identify aging and homebound populations , such as the disabled and the blind . The vaccine drive’s software platform was developed to support scheduling , vaccine administration reporting , and collection of demographic information . The team tested foreseeable technological risks before program implementation . Compliance with HIPAA , federal , state , and other regulatory reporting requirements were built into the program’s technology . Workpath , a proprietary software platform and subsidiary of Ro designed to provide logistical support for in - home health care , was used to coordinate and dispatch vaccinators to vaccine recipients’ homes , and alert them in real - time about their appointments . Operations and logistics NYS DOH provided Ro use of two federal and state approved vaccine storage sites : St . Joseph’s Hospital and the Westchester County Center . These centralized locations served as the starting and ending point for vaccinators . Onsite teams at the vaccine storage site coordinated with vaccinators to determine storage , pickup , and drop - oﬀ processes in advance . During pickup , vaccinators were equipped with vaccine storage / administration supplies and education materials . Because vaccines were scarce at the time the program was launched , standby potential vaccine recipients were recruited from a centralized location , i . e . , apartment complexes and local police / ﬁre stations . This enabled vaccinators to congregate at the end of the day and help each other administer leftover vaccines . Members of the Ro team created and ran machine learning models to optimize travel routes for maximum vaccine eﬃcacy . Contingency planning also included instituting emergency protocols for vaccinators to respond to AEs and reportable home situations , such as domestic and elder abuse . Moderna and Johnson & Johnson ( J & J ) vaccines were supplied by NYS DOH . Vaccine recipients were given Moderna or J & J depending on availability of the vaccine as supplied by NYS DOH . Moderna vaccines were administered February - May 2021 , and J & J vaccines were administered April - May 2021 , accounting for the pause from the CDC . Translation services were used when English was not a vaccine recipient’s ﬁrst or preferred language . Initially , the program used the help of bilingual community members and Google Translate services but this was not ultimately sustainable , as these sources of translation lengthened the duration of visits and were not consistently reliable for the exchange of medical information . This in turn impacted waste mitigation eﬀorts and vaccinator workload . Ultimately , Jeenie , a live web - based app speciﬁcally intended for medical translation , was used to translate for non - English speaking vaccine recipients . Data collection and analysis During the home visit , all vaccinators were required to observe vaccine recipients for signs of allergic reactions or adverse events immediately following vaccine administration . During this observation period , vaccinators verbally asked vaccine recipients demographic and health questions from an online questionnaire . Vaccinators were instructed not to read the answer choices aloud , with the exception of COVID - related health conditions . This was in order to prevent bias in vaccine recipients’ responses . The online questionnaire also allowed vaccinators to submit vaccine recipient consent forms , to record vaccine information . Vaccinators were also given paper copies of this questionnaire in case of technical diﬃculties . For data collection integrity , paper , and digital copies were cross - referenced . In the event that a vaccine recipient experienced vaccine - related side eﬀects , vaccinators submitted reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) . In total , the program reached 1 , 076 vaccine recipients . Of these patients , 1 , 063 received either a J & J dose ( n = 85 ) or at least a Moderna ﬁrst dose ( n = 978 ) . Those who only received a Moderna second dose ( n = 13 ) were ultimately omitted from analyses due to missingness in demographic data . This missingness was due to the structure of intake forms , which prioritized eﬃciency of vaccine administration over demographic data collection . People who only received one dose of the Moderna vaccine represented either standby cases who received contingency vaccines in order to mitigate FrontiersinPublicHealth 03 frontiersin . org Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 898787 waste , or who could not be reached to schedule an additional appointment . People under the age of 65 who received contingency vaccines ( n = 136 ) were also omitted from analyses . The ﬁnal analytical sample consisted of 927 vaccine recipients . Age categories of youngest - old ( 65 – 74 years ) , middle - old ( 75 – 84 years ) , and oldest - old ( 85 years and older ) were selected based on previous studies of older adults ( 23 , 24 ) . Vaccine recipients were able to choose multiple answers for the race / ethnicity question ; for a more parsimonious analysis , those who selected more than one answer or who chose “Other” were counted as a separate category . Conditions that were considered COVID - relevant comorbidities were determined using CDC guidelines ( 6 ) . Several of the answer choices for seeking / receiving in - home vaccinations were grouped together based on similarities in theme . Convenience and accessibility issues / concerns unrelated to disability contained the following answer choices : “I couldn’t get the vaccine at a traditional site ( e . g . , line / wait times were too long ) , ” “The closest vaccination site was too far away , ” and “In - home vaccination is more convenient . ” Concern , hesitancy , and / or lack of resources about COVID - 19 vaccination contained the following answer choices : “I didn’t think I needed the vaccine , ” “I didn’t know I could get it somewhere other than in my home , ” “I didn’t know how to get an appointment at a traditional site ( e . g . , diﬃculty using online sign - up ) , ” and “I don’t have a regular doctor and was concerned I would be able to follow up if things went wrong . ” I am home - bound due to mobility , cognitive , or other disability - related reasons and I am avoiding high - risk / public areas due to COVID concerns were kept as their own categories . The answer choice “My job or other responsibilities prevent me from going to a traditional site during open hours” was excluded due to a small analytical subgroup ( n = 9 ) . For each category of number of comorbidities reported , diﬀerences in age category were compared . For each reason cited as motivation for receiving and / or seeking in - home care as an alternative to receiving the vaccine at a traditional vaccination site , diﬀerences in age , sex , and race / ethnicity were compared . Diﬀerences in distribution of race / ethnicity across reasons cited were visualized as a heatmap . Of each reason cited , the darker colors represent a higher percentage of the racial / ethnic group citing that reason . Only Black / African American , Latinx , Asian American / Paciﬁc Islander , and White / Caucasian were included , due to small sample sizes for those who listed other races / ethnicities . Chi - squared tests were used as statistical tests of diﬀerence . A p - value of < 0 . 05 was considered signiﬁcant , and a p - value between 0 . 05 and 0 . 10 was considered marginally signiﬁcant . Questions for which vaccine recipients answered “prefer not to answer” or “don’t know” were considered missing data . R version 4 . 0 . 3 was used . Results Key program evaluation lessons learned Several learnings emerged throughout the course of the in - home vaccination program . First , we had not initially accounted for the time needed to accommodate vaccine recipients who expressed vaccine hesitancy . In response , we updated appointment time windows for extended vaccine education during the visit and developed workﬂows to ensure that vaccinators were continually equipped with up - to - date vaccine education information and guidance from state and federal health organizations . This was especially important in responding to vaccine recipient concerns about the CDC - recommended J & J vaccine pause , which occurred in the middle of the program . Second , because our vaccine recipient population consisted of homebound seniors , we had not anticipated the need for rescheduling appointments and thus did not design the scheduling system to accommodate this need . Initially , the only way for vaccine recipients to reschedule was to ﬁll out a new online form , creating the issue of duplicate data entries . We ultimately built the capability to submit back - dated reports into our technological infrastructure so that we could cross - reference paper reports to revise missing / inaccurate information in virtual reports . On the day of , close communication with building managers helped the operations team understand whether they could expect vaccine recipients to be available later that day . If they were , vaccine recipients who missed their initial appointment time could opt to receive their vaccination during end - of - day contingency administration . To ﬁll vacancies where possible , the operations and hotline teams rescheduled vaccine recipients with later appointments to be seen earlier . Both vaccine hesitancy and rescheduling challenges might have contributed to the small percentage of vaccine recipients who did not receive their required second dose . Another challenge and program limitation was digital sign up . Using a digital platform reduced administrative burden on the program side but might have created access barriers for some . To some extent the program design anticipated that some vaccine recipients might be dependent on caregivers or community outreach workers to sign them up and create appointments , but this led to instances where vaccine recipients themselves did not have a phone number or email address where they could be reached to coordinate appointments . We found it eﬀective to work directly with apartment building managers and staﬀ , who helped coordinate on their residents’ behalf . Future programs might consider a dedicated telephone hotline might remove access challenges for socially isolated seniors without FrontiersinPublicHealth 04 frontiersin . org Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 898787 suﬃcient internet or computer access , or with limited digital literacy . Adverse events Five hundred and thirty - four patients reported mild side eﬀects , including pain at injection site , redness at injection site , swelling at injection site , nausea / vomiting , fever , muscle aches , tiredness , chills , and headache . Five reports were submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) for patients who experienced a more serious health event some time after receiving a dose , though it was undetermined whether these cases were related to the vaccine . Results from analysis on demographic and health - related data Table 1 shows demographic and health characteristics of the vaccine recipient population . The median age was 79 ± SD 9 . 0 years , and there were approximately the same proportion of vaccine recipients in each age group ( 32 . 0 % vaccine recipients in the youngest - old age group , 36 . 6 % in the middle - old group , and 31 . 4 % in the oldest - old age group ) . The oldest vaccine recipient was 107 years old . No age data were missing . Of those vaccine recipients with non - missing data , most vaccine recipients were female ( 63 . 1 % ) , identiﬁed as part of a racial / ethnic minority ( 66 . 4 % ) , reported an annual income of < $ 25 , 000 ( 57 . 7 % ) , and received a high school degree or less ( 68 . 1 % ) . Most vaccine recipients ( 72 . 0 % ) reported having at least one conditions associated with increased risk of severe COVID - 19 disease , and 39 . 2 % reporting reported having multiple COVID - related comorbidities . The most commonly reported conditions were high blood pressure ( 57 . 3 % ) , heart conditions ( 22 . 9 % ) , and / or diabetes ( 21 . 3 % ) . Most vaccine recipients learned about the in - home vaccination program through a community organization ( 59 . 8 % ) and / or a friend or family member ( 22 . 0 % ) . The majority of vaccine recipients received health insurance through Medicare ( 74 . 2 % ) , and almost a quarter received health insurance through Medicaid ( 21 . 6 % ) . Table 2 shows the number of COVID - related comorbidities , by age group . The number of COVID - related comorbidities did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly by age group ( p = 0 . 18 ) . Table 3 shows diﬀerences in vaccine recipients’ motivations for seeking in - home care as an alternative to vaccination at traditional sites , by age group . Among all patients , the most commonly cited motivation was being home - bound due to mobility , cognitive , or other disability - related reasons ( 44 . 5 % ) . This was followed by convenience and accessibility issues / concerns unrelated to disability ( 35 . 3 % ) ; avoiding public areas due to concerns about COVID - 19 transmission ( 27 . 2 % ) ; and concern , hesitancy , and / or lack of resources about COVID - 19 vaccination ( 21 . 9 % ) . When examining diﬀerences between age groups , we found that vaccine recipients who said they sought in - home vaccination because they were home - bound due to disability were most likely to be aged 85 years or older ; 38 . 9 % of those citing this reason were in the oldest - old age group ( p = 0 . 004 ) . Vaccine recipients who cited convenience and accessibility issues unrelated to disability were more likely to be in the middle - old age group ( 38 . 9 % ) , though this diﬀerence was marginally signiﬁcant ( p = 0 . 05 ) . There were no diﬀerences in age group between vaccine recipients who cited avoidance of public areas due to concerns about COVID transmission or concern , hesitancy , and / or lack of resources about COVID - 19 vaccination ( p > 0 . 10 ) . Table 4 shows diﬀerences in motivations for seeking in - home care , by sex . Compared to males , females were more likely to report being home - bound as a reason for seeking / receiving in - home vaccination ( 67 . 8 % , p = 0 . 047 ) . There was a noticeably smaller proportion of females who reported a reason related to a concern , hesitancy , and / or lack of resources about COVID - 19 vaccination ( 56 . 6 % ) ; this was marginally signiﬁcant ( p = 0 . 08 ) . We did not observe any sex diﬀerences in those who reported seeking in - home care due to avoidance of public areas or convenience / accessibility issues unrelated to disability were observed ( p > 0 . 10 ) . Figure 1 shows motivations for seeking in - home care as an alternative to traditional vaccination sites , by race / ethnicity . There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in race / ethnicity for all motivations ( p < 0 . 05 ) , except for avoidance of public areas ( p = 0 . 42 ) ; however , proportionally more Black / African American ( 13 . 3 % ) and Latinx ( 33 . 1 % ) vaccine recipients reported avoiding public areas than other races . White / Caucasian ( 52 . 8 % ) and Black / African American vaccine recipients were more likely than other races to report being home - bound due to disability ( 13 . 2 % , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Those citing convenience and accessibility issues unrelated to disability were more likely to identify as a race / ethnicity other than White ( p = 0 . 003 ) . Vaccine recipients who identiﬁed as Asian American / Paciﬁc Islander were more likely to seek / receive in - home care due to concern , hesitancy , and / or lack of resources about COVID - 19 vaccination ( 41 . 4 % , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Discussion This in - home COVID - 19 vaccination program aimed to serve vulnerable populations most at risk for severe COVID - 19 disease ; the objective of this study was to determine whether the program achieved its aim , both by reﬂecting on lessons learned from implementation and by conducting a formal analysis of demographic and health - related data . In total , 1 , 063 people were fully vaccinated . While we consider this to be an indicator of success , one limitation of this evaluation is the lack FrontiersinPublicHealth 05 frontiersin . org Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 898787 TABLE 1 Demographic and health characteristics of patients seeking care from an in - home COVID - 19 vaccination program .

FIGURE1 Motivations for seeking in - home care as an alternative to traditional vaccination sites , race / ethnicity ( n = 670 ) . of cost / beneﬁt analysis due to the nature of funding for the program . This is a highly useful metric for other organizations considering launching a similar initiative . However , from a process evaluation standpoint , we learned several operational lessons that can inform future eﬀorts how to maximize program eﬃciency and reduce administrative costs in future iterations of in - home care delivery programs . This includes accounting for the amount of provider - facing time that patients may need to ask questions about the care they are receiving , as well as surveying the population in order to gain a clear and thorough understanding of their speciﬁc needs . The latter is essential to informing what additional services or resources may be needed ; in our program we found that , in order for the ultimate goal of vaccine delivery to actually be eﬀective , we needed comprehensive scheduling capabilities , language translation services , and phone alternatives to digital sign - ups . The main limitation of the outcome evaluation was missing data , which may have biased reporting . For example , White vaccine recipients may have seemed more likely to cite being homebound as a motivation for seeking in - home vaccination because White vaccine recipients were more likely to answer questions . However , as minority populations may be less likely to respond to race / ethnicity survey questions ( 25 ) , there is a possibility that members of vulnerable populations made up an even larger portion of the vaccine recipient population than observed in the existing data . To alleviate discomfort in disclosing sensitive information , future iterations of this program should prioritize written collection of demographic data , as data missingness was at least partially attributable to the verbal delivery of sensitive questions . Thoughtful collection of these types of data is integral to tracking program progress in equitable distribution of care . Other potential limitations included lack of generalizability due to the speciﬁcity of the study population ( older adults living in Yonkers , NY ) , and inaccuracy of income data collected from retirement - age individuals . While the latter is a limitation inherent to this population , it may FrontiersinPublicHealth 08 frontiersin . org Zhou et al . 10 . 3389 / fpubh . 2022 . 898787 be inferred that this population’s concerns with vaccination ( especially in traditional , in - person settings ) are consistent with other populations with similar demographic characteristics ( older adults with additional indices of social vulnerability ) . This is especially important when considering disease prevention in older adults amidst the continued emergence of new COVID - 19 variants . Limitations notwithstanding , this innovative in - home COVID - 19 vaccination program allowed medical professionals to vaccinate high - risk seniors despite mobility , accessibility , transmission risk , and vaccine hesitancy barriers . Data collection was a focal point of the program and executed via ( 1 ) a simpliﬁed registration process and ( 2 ) the capture of key demographic and health information , in order to assess whether the program met its goals of prioritizing areas with the highest COVID burden , communities with high indexes of economic hardship , and people with mobility and access barriers . These were in line with expert recommendations ( 13 ) . Indeed , of those who answered demographic questions , most were part of a racial / ethnic minority group and reported lower household income and educational attainment . The majority of vaccine recipients were women . Though early research indicated that , compared to men , women were more likely to express hesitancy about COVID - 19 vaccination , these studies were conducted prior to the availability of vaccines and asked about hypothetical behavior ( 26 , 27 ) . Once vaccines were available in the US , women were more likely to seek and receive COVID - 19 vaccinations ( 28 ) . Older women appear more likely to utilize in - home health services , mainly attributable to women’s greater health needs ( 29 ) . More research is needed to understand the drivers behind lower uptake for men and whether future programs can mitigate this through targeted outreach . The social vulnerability of this vaccine recipient population was underscored by the high proportion of people who reported receiving health insurance through Medicare and Medicaid . Most reported having at least one COVID - related health condition , regardless of age . The most commonly reported conditions were high blood pressure , heart conditions , and diabetes . Of note , the majority of vaccine recipients reported that they heard about the in - home vaccination program through a community organization , emphasizing the importance of partnership with local and government organizations . When asked why they sought or received in - home COVID - 19 vaccination , those who cited being home - bound due to disability were more likely to be older , female , and White / Caucasian or Black / African American . This was also the most commonly cited reason overall , meaning the program achieved its original goal of reaching homebound seniors , particularly the oldest subset of the 65 + population . Those citing convenience and accessibility issues unrelated to disability were more likely to be in the middle range of older adulthood and to be non - White . This may reﬂect well - documented environmental and transportation barriers to healthcare for minority populations ( 30 ) . Though it was not statistically signiﬁcant , proportionally more Black and Latinx vaccine recipients reported seeking in - home care in order to avoid public areas . Black and Latinx populations are known to be disproportionately aﬀected by COVID , due to greater vulnerability to risk factors that increase risk of transmission ( i . e . fewer economic opportunities to work in non - public facing jobs ) and health inequities that promote the development of COVID - related comorbidities ( 9 ) . Those citing a reason related to concern , hesitancy , and / or lack of resources about vaccination were more likely to be Asian American / Paciﬁc Islander . These may be related to language barriers and insulation from knowledge of social services often experienced by older AAPI adults ( 31 ) . Variation in responses as to why seniors opted for in - home vaccination underscore the importance of one of the program’s guiding principles : attempting to deﬁne a measure of home - boundedness for program inclusion criteria , e . g . , a documented disability , would have resulted in the exclusion of many community members from the program . Those exclusions would likely have included a disproportionate amount of non - White recipients . The added administrative burden would have also undermined program administrators’ capacity to address logistical challenges , such as ensuring second dose appointments occurred and preventing vaccine waste . Together , both our program evaluation learnings and our analysis of the population served indicate that our in - home care delivery program was successful in its implementation and can inform future iterations of similar programs . The population receiving in - home vaccination services through this program were mostly non - White , were part of socioeconomically disadvantaged communities , and reported one or more COVID - related health conditions , indicating that the in - home vaccination program was successful in reaching high - need , high - risk seniors . The importance and timeliness of in - home vaccination programs—especially given ongoing concerns and barriers around receiving vaccinations in public areas for those most vulnerable to severe disease—should be considered in light of new COVID - 19 variants .
