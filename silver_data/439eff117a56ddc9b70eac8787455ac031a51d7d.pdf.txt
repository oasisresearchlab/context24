COVID - 19 vaccination is critical for reducing the alarming incidence of the infection , promoting herd immunity , preventing associated mortality and morbidity , and maintaining public health and safety . Through the development of COVID - 19 vaccines , many people are keen to protect themselves against the virus ; however , the willingness for vaccination especially in Africa , is far below what is required to stop the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic . As a result , there is an immediate need to implement plans aimed at increasing population vaccine willingness . The slippery slope is whether sanctions , bans and restriction should be imposed on hesitant persons , since transmission of the epidemic can be prevented through stringent enforcement of the control barriers , while eradicating the disease would necessitate vaccination . This commentary provides recommendations about how to increase population vaccine acceptance while maintaining autonomy . ARTICLE HISTORY Received 5 April 2021 Accepted 21 April 2021 KEYWORDS Autonomy ; COVID - 19 ; vaccination ; vaccine acceptance ; vaccine hesitancy Introduction The superspreading nature and impact of coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) on the general population and healthcare system have been unprecedented . 1 The pandemic has attained rapid global transmission partly owing to the high number of asymp - tomatic carriers interacting in a world interconnected by supply chain , communications technology and travel . 2 Movements to workplaces , urbanization , daily human connection , the mingling of families in communities and international travels intensify the transmissibility of the virus . 3 Such undertakings pose a challenge for mitigating the spread and predispose close contacts of COVID - 19 patients to the infection . Recent report revealed that the family household infection rate is estimated between 16 . 3 % and 30 % . 4 The aged , as well as the elderly , with certain underlying medical condition , are at high risk of serious infection from the virus , which , and can result in hospitalization , admission to intensive care units , intubation and even death . The threats posed by COVID - 19 are immense , but everyone must remain vigilant , follow the mandatory protection precautions and most preeminently , get vaccinated as this would keep the pandemic under control while still shielding individuals and families in the community from the deadly virus . COVID - 19 vaccine hesitancy COVID - 19 vaccination is critical for reducing the alarming incidence of the infection , promoting herd immunity , prevent - ing associated mortality and morbidity , and maintaining public health and safety . 5 Numerous persons are eager to defend themselves against the virus now that the COVID - 19 vaccines have been developed and made available ; however , certain families and individuals may deliberately opt not to be immu - nized . Vaccine hesitancy is known to be caused by a number of factors , especially when new vaccines are being produced . These factors include misconceptions regarding the need for vaccines , vaccine protection and efficacy , negative health effects , lack of confidence in the health system , and lack of community awareness about vaccine - preventable diseases . 6 – 8 Although the World Health Organization approved COVID - 19 vaccines have undergone stringent testing and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and success in con - trolling the pandemic , a report from the United Kingdom stated that one of every five persons was unlikely to take the COVID - 19 vaccines for a number of reasons . 9 Summarily , a study that assessed hesitancy to a COVID - 19 vaccine in Cameroon and its global implication among 2512 participants shockingly reported vaccine hesitancy rate of 84 . 6 % citing communication and media environment , perception of phar - maceutical industry , reliability and / or source of vaccine and cost as influencing factors . 10 Another study investigating the level of willingness for COVID - 19 vaccination in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) reported that , of the 4131 responses , 2310 ( 55 . 9 % ) indicated their willingness to be vaccinated and income status , COVID - 19 status , COVID - 19 community vaccine acceptance and acknowledging the exis - tence of COVID - 19 were associated with an increased will - ingness to be vaccinated . 11 CONTACT Serwaa Dorcas dserwaa0327 @ stu . ui . edu . ng Institute of Life and Earth Sciences ( Including Health and Agriculture ) , University of Ibadan , Olatunde Runsewe Hall , Ibadan , Nigeria HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS 2021 , VOL . 17 , NO . 12 , 5139 – 5141 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1080 / 21645515 . 2021 . 1922265 © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group , LLC The slippery slope between COVID - 19 vaccine autonomy and uptake enforcement Every person has the right to confidently refuse vaccination and this decision must be understood and respected . Therefore , managing COVID - 19 reluctant individuals and their families’ actions may trigger conflict between honoring and promoting a person’s decision - making autonomy and upholding of professional duty to encourage evidence - based decisions , aimed at achieving optimal outcome for both families and individuals . The slippery slope is whether sanc - tions , bans and restriction be imposed on people that resist COVID - 19 vaccination , since it is already commonly recog - nized that the transmission of the epidemic can be prevented through stringent enforcement of the control barriers , while eradicating the disease would necessitate the uptake of a vaccine . The willingness for vaccination especially in Africa , is far below what is required to stop the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic , as a result , there is an immediate need to implement plans to increase population vaccine willingness . Recommendations to increase population vaccine acceptance Educational campaigns Outreach campaigns aimed at improving awareness and dis - pelling some of the vaccine’s well - known stereotypes must be extended to build more optimistic perceptions and decisions toward the vaccine use . An educational strategy of this kind should include factual information , discuss various vaccination issues , and provide answer to questions regarding COVID - 19 vaccine misconception . People must be persuaded that the system for developing , testing and regulating vaccine demands that every vaccine shows both safety and efficacy prior to licensure , and therefore the safety of the current COVID - 19 is well assured and monitored . The campaigns should also emphasize the benefits of the vac - cinations to the recipient , immediate family , neighbors , society and the world at large . The advertisement should appeal to the emotions and fears of individuals but not to scare anyone into taking a specific action . It must also be greared towards protecting the general population’s vulnerability and effective enough to encourage vaccination . If the morbidities , mortalities , and realities associated with the virus are intensely communicated , the public would recognize the growing burden and be willing to take the vaccines . Strategic communication Health communication must reach all communities , especially the most vulnerable , educating them about the safety of the vaccines and the potency to prevent future infections and deaths . Communication about the vaccine can be promoted through community van mobilization , radios , televisions , leaflets and tele - phone hotlines , to enlighten the general public about vaccine - related information like accessibility , availability , efficacy , known side effects , benefits , protocols and triage decisions . Respected community - based organizations and non - governmental agencies , such as the Red Cross , Faith leaders and religious leaders , which are widely regarded as neutral , are critical in fostering interest in COVID - 19 vaccine uptake . Health professionals’ ‘self - vaccination’ strategy Health professionals’ self - vaccination strategy can influence families and individuals who refuse COVID - 19 vaccination . Vaccine acceptance depends on public trust and confidence in the safety , efficacy of the vaccines and immunization . The recommendation of healthcare providers and trust in the healthcare system are most often cited explanation for general public approval for vaccination . 8 , 12 This implies that the public relies on the expertise judgment and willingness of health professionals to view these results accurately and in the best interests of the public . Therfore , the uptake of COVID - 19 vaccine by healthcare providers in the presence of their patients will build trust and affirms the safety of the vaccine . Healthcare professionals ‘patients’ vaccination’ strategy Health professionals should prescribe the COVID - 19 vaccines for those unwilling to vaccinate . The key reasons for healthcare professionals prescribing vaccinations to their patients include a belief in the benefits of vaccines and a sense of responsibility to encourage protection and vaccination . One research found that recommending vaccines to patients requires a trusting doctor – patient partnership . 13 Healthcare professionals have the responsibility of continuously engaging COVID - 19 hesi - tant families and individuals during the provision of healthcare services and public health education sessions in an attempt to modifying their behavior to reconsider vaccination . Healthcare providers must be capable of articulating the safety and efficacy of the vaccine to their clients and also refrain from suggesting that refusing vaccination may be safer . Recent study on acceptance of a pandemic influenza vac - cine : a systematic review of surveys of the general public , reported that respondents who received positive advice from a primary care physician for vaccination were more likely to accept the pandemic vaccine , and those who did not receive positive advice were more likely to decline the vaccine . 12 Safety information must be presented in a non - confrontational dia - logue . Opel et al . 14 reported that hesitant families do accept vaccination after their healthcare practitioners have provided a rationale for vaccine administration . ‘COVID - 19 vaccination passports’ or proof of COVID - 19 vaccination The introduction of ‘COVID - 19 vaccination passports’ or proof of COVID - 19 vaccination , however this topic is highly debatable . Travel restrictions are public health emergency mea - sures to reduce the spread of pandemics and other highly infectious diseases like influenza , yellow fever and polio . The revised International Health Regulations ( IHR ) in 2005 expanded the scope of internationally important diseases from three ( cholera , plague and yellow fever ) to include all “events which may constitute public health emergencies of international concern” . 15 5140 D . SERWAA ET AL . In the yellow fever antecedent , prior to the availability of a vaccine in 1937 , the key tactic used in an attempt to limit its dissemination was to rely on old - fashioned methods of isolation and quarantine . 16 Vaccine entry requirement became the key disease prevention mechanism of the post - vaccination period . Vaccine entry requirement are provisions for travelers to present evidence of vaccination for specific diseases in order to enter a country . These conditions extend to all travelers or visitors coming from areas where the disease is at risk of spread . Likewise , issuing ‘COVID - 19 vaccination passports’ or proof of COVID - 19 vaccination could mean that persons would be allowed to travel freely outside their home country provided they have evidence of immunization . This will promote the resump - tion of air transport and help in the revitalization of national economies . However , there are several arguments as to whether it is ethically permissible to impose such practice on people who refuse vaccination . This will depend on factors like the level of vaccination in the general population , vaccine supply , the nature of restriction and how the restrictions are operationalized . COVID - 19 vaccine certificates The general public should be required to have COVID - 19 vac - cine certificates to gain access to some essential public services and places within the country . Just as children must show - up their immunity certificate against certain diseases before they can be enrolled at a new school and also similar to ‘no mask no entry’ advocacy . This will reopen the economy , make people adapt to the new normal , remind others to get their shots and also improve the safety of staffs and customers in such public places . The pre - pandemic freedom for individuals who refuse to vaccinate against the COVID - 19 should not affect others nega - tively or cause more serious cases of coronavirus disease . It is therefore justifiable to restrict vaccine refusers to reduce onward transmission . A section of the population will accept vaccination if given the choice between immunization and restric - tions at essential public services . However , these restrictions must be conducted in a manner consistent with established health guidelines and prior official notification must be provided to all and sundry involved . In situations where there is limited ability to restrict hesitant people , as is the case of a hospital environment , established organizational policies should be followed and all necessary services must be rendered regardless . Conclusion The COVID - 19 vaccines can contribute to the control of the deadly pandemic , although the vaccines may not be fully protec - tive . Refusal of the vaccine will trigger re - emergence of the pan - demic , which can be harmful to individuals and the general populace . Hence , public health authorities , health providers and all stakeholders involved in the fight against this pandemic have a professional responsibility to provide scientifically proven infor - mation in managing encounters with non - vaccinating families and individuals . The approach should identify the basis of people’s decisions , address concerns and execute the recommended actions to encourage vaccine uptake while upholding ethical responsibilities .
