Pollard , Yale University , New Haven , CT , and approved September 22 , 2014 ( received for review June 30 , 2014 ) Thymosin - β 4 ( T β 4 ) and profilin are the two major sequestering proteins that maintain the pool of monomeric actin ( G - actin ) within cells of higher eukaryotes . T β 4 prevents G - actin from joining a fila - ment , whereas profilin : actin only supports barbed - end elongation . Here , we report two T β 4 : actin structures . The first structure shows that T β 4 has two helices that bind at the barbed and pointed faces of G - actin , preventing the incorporation of the bound G - actin into a filament . The second structure displays a more open nucleotide binding cleft on G - actin , which is typical of profilin : actin structures , with a concomitant disruption of the T β 4 C - terminal helix interac - tion . These structures , combined with biochemical assays and mo - lecular dynamics simulations , show that the exchange of bound actin between T β 4 and profilin involves both steric and allosteric components . The sensitivity of profilin to the conformational state of actin indicates a similar allosteric mechanism for the dissociation of profilin during filament elongation . crystallography | protein complex | thermodynamics | molecular dynamics | fluorescence M onomeric actin ( G - actin ) is maintained at levels far above the critical concentration for polymerization ( 0 . 1 μ M ) ( 1 ) in specific areas of a mammalian cell . In lamellipodia , the levels of G - actin and filamentous actin ( F - actin ) are estimated to be 150 and 500 μ M , respectively ( 2 ) . Generally , actin filaments are thought to be capped to prevent nonproductive polymerization , whereas actively elongating filaments are created through con - trolled uncapping , severing , or de novo nucleation mechanisms ( 3 ) to harness the force of polymerization for a particular biological process . The availability of the pool of G - actin is tightly regulated through the binding of two classes of G - actin sequestering proteins ( 3 , 4 ) . β - Thymosins are short peptides ( ∼ 43 aa ) that are able to completely sequester G - actin , preventing G - actin from forming a nucleus or joining either end of an existing actin filament . Profilins ( molecular mass ∼ 16 kDa ) , in isolation , also sequester G - actin , precluding nucleation or participation in pointed - end filament elongation . In contrast , they actively participate in barbed - end fil - ament elongation , dissociating from the actin protomer as it is in - corporatedinto the filament . In the presence of actin nucleation and elongation machineries , such as actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex activators , formins , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) homology domain 2 ( WH2 ) - containing nucleators [ Spire , protein Cordon - bleu ( Cobl ) , and VopF / L ] , and vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) ( 5 , 6 ) , profilin plays an active role in the nucleation and elongation processes . Cellular concentrations of thymosin - β 4 ( T β 4 ) are in the 100 - to 500 - μ M range , and its association with ATP - and ADP - bound actin is characterized by dissociation constant ( K d ) values of 0 . 1 – 3 . 9 and 80 – 100 μ M , respectively ( 7 – 11 ) . Profilin I has been reported to be at a concentration of 8 . 4 μ M in CHO cells ( 12 ) and can amount from 14 % to 100 % of the G - actin pool in other cells ( 13 ) . Profilin I interacts with actin with K d values of 0 . 1 and 0 . 17 μ M for ATP - and ADP - bound actin , respectively , and is able to enhance the exchange of ADP for ATP ( 14 ) . Taken together , these data lead to a model whereby the pool of ATP – G - actin is shared between T β 4 and profilin . During phases of polymeriza - tion , the profilin – actin complex gives up its actin to the elon - gating filaments . The liberated profilin competes with T β 4 for its bound ATP – G - actin , effectively restoring the pool of polymeri - zation - competent actin . On filament dissociation , ADP - actin is preferentially sequestered by profiling because of the afore - mentioned difference in its affinity toward profilin and T β 4 . In the profilin : actin complex , nucleotide exchange is enhanced , and the resulting ATP - actin is subject to competition between pro - filin and T β 4 , resulting in the restoration of the pool of T β 4 - sequestered actin . Since thediscovery oftheactinbinding activity of T β 4 intheearly 1990s ( 15 , 16 ) , manyefforts havebeenmadeto elucidate the atomic details of this interaction , including those by fluorescence ( 17 , 18 ) , NMR ( 19 – 23 ) , small - angle X - ray scattering ( 23 ) , X - ray crystallog - raphy [ on either part of T β 4 ( 24 ) or its protein homolog ( 25 , 26 ) ] , and structure - based modeling ( 24 , 27 ) . Despite these efforts , a de - tailed picture of the interaction between actin and full - length T β 4 and in particular , its N - terminal portion remains elusive , which may , in part , be attributed to the dynamic nature of this interaction . Here , we report two structures of the T β 4 : actin complex , which were realized through the design of hybrid proteins . Comparison of these structures with those of the profilin : actin complex combined with biochemical assays , molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations , and principal component analysis ( PCA ) shows that both steric and allosteric mechanisms are involved in the exchange of bound actin between T β 4 and profilin . These two proteins have partially Significance Thymosin - β 4 ( T β 4 ) sequesters actin monomers to help maintain the high concentrations of unpolymerized actin in higher eukaryotic cells . Despite more than two decades of research investigating the T β 4 – actin interaction , the X - ray structure of the full - length T β 4 : actin complex remained unresolved . Here , we report two X - ray structures of T β 4 : actin complexes . The first structure reveals that T β 4 has two helices that bind at the bar - bed and pointed faces of actin , whereas the second structure displays a more open actin nucleotide binding cleft and a dis - ruption of the T β 4 C - terminal helix interaction . These structures , combined with biochemical assays and molecular dynamics simulations , reveal how T β 4 prevents monomeric actin from joining actin filaments but participates in the exchange of actin with profilin to ensure controlled actin polymerization .

In addition , they also exert allosteric effects onto each other by stabilizing different conformations of the actin monomer through regulating the width of its nucleotide binding cleft . Results Two Structures Show Different Conformations of T β 4 : Actin . To de - termine the structure of the intrinsically disordered T β 4 polypeptide in its ordered conformation bound to actin , we created a hybrid protein consisting of full - length human T β 4 fused through a flexible linker to Pichia ( Komagataella ) pastoris actin ( 28 ) . The structure of this chimera was determined to a resolution of 2 . 3 Å by X - ray crystallography ( Fig . 1 , Table 1 , and Fig . S1 A ) , with two copies of the chimeric protein in the asymmetric unit . The visible residues in the final electron density map include Val5 to Gly36 and Ser52 to Ser365 of actin and Asp5 to Ala40 of T β 4 . There was no in - terpretable electron density for the N and C termini and the D loop of actin , the linker between actin and T β 4 , or the first four ( Ser1 to Pro4 ) and the last three residues ( Gly41 to Ser43 ) of T β 4 . As had been predicted ( 27 ) , T β 4 makes extensive contact with actin , with an N - terminal α - helix ( Asp5 to Lys11 ) and a C - terminal α - helix ( Lys31 to Gln39 ) spanning the nucleotide binding cleft from the barbed to the pointed face of the monomer . This conformation is referred to hereafter as fully bound T β 4 . The occluded interface between T β 4 and actin is 1 , 626 . 8 Å 2 according to the Protein interfaces , surfaces and assemblies ( PISA ) service at the European Bioinformatics Institute ( www . ebi . ac . uk / pdbe / prot _ int / pistart . html ) ( 29 ) , of which the contribution from the residues after the LKKT motif ( Glu21 to Ala40 ) is 945 . 1 Å 2 and that from the C - terminal helix alone ( Lys31 to Gln39 ) is 391 . 9 Å 2 . Comparison with the structure of unbound , unmodified G - actin [ native G - actin ; Pro - tein Data Bank ( PDB ) ID code 3HBT ] ( 30 ) reveals that the nucleotide binding cleft , which is bridged by the T β 4 C - terminal α - helix , closes , narrowing the distance between subdomains 2 and 4 at the pointed face of actin . This closure is accompanied by a flat - tening of the monomer structure with respect to that of native G - actin , although to a far lesser extent than observed in the actin filament ( 31 , 32 ) ( Figs . 1 D and 3 C ) . These conformational changes on actin clearly indicate that the T β 4 C - terminal α - helix forms an integral part of the T β 4 : actin interface and is critical in stabilizing actin in a more closed and flattened conformation . Consistent with this observation , previous experimental evidence has shown that ( i ) removal of the C - terminal portion of T β 4 results in 4 - to 20 - fold reduction in its affinity for actin ( 9 , 33 ) , ( ii ) compared with full - length T β 4 , a 12 - fold higher concentration of a truncated version of T β 4 ( Ser1 to Ser30 ) is needed to inhibit actin polymerization ( 34 ) , and ( iii ) NMR analysis showed that the C - terminal α - helix of a chimera containing the N terminus of Ciboulot ( Leu8 to Gly24 ) fused to the C terminus of T β 4 ( residues Phe12 - Ser43 ) maintains stable interactions with actin under physiological conditions ( 23 ) . Concomitant with the closure of the cleft at the pointed face of the T β 4 - bound actin , there is a slight widening of the groove at the barbed face between subdomains 1 and 3 , possibly because of the relative rigidity of the large domain that com - prises actin subdomains 3 and 4 ( 35 ) . In addition to the structure of the complex of T β 4 with Pichia actin , we solved the structure of a hybrid peptide complexed with rabbit skeletal actin ( Fig . 1 and Fig . S1 B ) . The overall sequence identity between Pichia and rabbit skeletal actins is 83 % , and 85 % ( 47 of 55 ) of the residues in the T β 4 binding interface are identical , with residue substitutions M16L , H28R , T29A , A167E , T199S , S201V , S203T , and G350S from Pichia actin to rabbit skeletal actin . The hybrid peptide comprises the N - terminal portion of human T β 4 before the LKKT motif ( Ser1 - Lys16 ) , the lysine - rich region ( Phe1095 - Asp1106 ) of Cobl , and full - length human T β 4 ( Ser1 - Ser43 ) . This hybrid , in complex with rabbit skeletal actin , was amenable to crystallization and led to an electron density map in which only regions from T β 4 and actin were visible . There are two copies of actin in the asymmetric unit , forming an antiparallel contact with an interface areaof 940 . 6Å 2 ( Fig . S2 A ) . Clear electron density for a polypeptide chain is visible on the surface of one actin molecule , which can be unambiguously assigned to residues Pro4 to Lys25 of T β 4 ( residues 34 – 55 of the hybrid ) ( Fig . S2 C ) ; for the second actin molecule , there is weak density near its barbed face ( Fig . S2 D ) at a position equivalent to residues Met6 to Ile9 of T β 4 on the first actin . This density is tentatively assigned to residues 8 – 11 of the hybrid construct , although we cannot rule out the density arising from a second chain of the hybrid peptide . Subsequent dis - cussion focuses on the first actin molecule with its unambiguously assigned T β 4 residues . T β 4 in this structure lacks an ordered C - terminal α - helix ( referred to as T β 4N ) , and the pointed face of Fig . 1 . Two structures of T β 4 : actin .

Otherwise , the ordered T β 4 residues in contact with actin adopt very similar conformations as those observed in the structure of T β 4 complexed with Pichia actin . Thus , the T β 4 C - terminal α - helix acts as a sensor and sta - bilizer of the closed actin conformation of subdomains 2 and 4 , and in the context of the crystal , in which a more open confor - mation of actin has been stabilized by the formation of antipar - allel actin dimers , the T β 4 C - terminal α - helix has dissociated . Competition Between T β 4 and Profilin Affects Actin Polymerization . T β 4 and profilin are known to compete with each other for binding actin ( 36 , 37 ) . Because T β 4 and profilin act oppositely during actin barbed - end elongation ( 3 ) , with T β 4 blocking and profilin allowing their bound G - actin to join the barbed end of a filament , the com - petition between the two proteins creates an effective way of tuning the rate and extent of actin polymerization . To provide additional evidence at the level of single - actin filaments , we visualized , using total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , the behaviors of T β 4 , profilin , and their combinations in filament elongation ( Fig . 2 A ) . Profilin : actin ( 0 . 7 and 0 . 35 μ M , respectively ) supported elongation of preexisting filaments in a similar manner to uncomplexed actin ( 0 . 35 μ M ) , whereas T β 4 , at 3 . 5 μ M ( molar ratio 10 : 1 to actin ) , completely inhibited barbed - end elongation . Adding profilin to the T β 4 – actin mixture to 0 . 7 μ M ( two times the molar concentration of actin ) showed no indication of antago - nizing T β 4 sequestration ( Fig . S3 A , Left ) , because under these conditions ( 0 . 35 μ M actin , 0 . 7 μ M profilin , and 3 . 5 μ M T β 4 ) , the combined concentration of polymerization - competent species ( uncomplexed and profilin - complexed actin ) was still below 0 . 1 μ M , the critical concentration for actin barbed - end polymerization ( Fig . 5 shows the dissociation constants , and Table 3 shows the calculated concentrations ) . When the total actin concentration was increased to 1 . 0 μ M , while maintaining the previous molar ratios for profilin ( 2 . 0 μ M ) and T β 4 ( 10 . 0 μ M ) , the competition between T β 4 and profilin became apparent , and barbed - end elongation was observed . As a control , the binary mixture of T β 4 and actin at these elevated concentrations remains inactive ( Fig . S3 A , Right ) . T β 4 : Actin Structures Support the Formation of Profilin : Actin : T β 4 Complexes . The competition between T β 4 and profilin has been proposed to proceed through the formation of a ternary complex of profilin , T β 4 , and actin ( 38 ) . To gain additional structural insight into such ternary complex formation , the newly solved T β 4 : actin structures were superimposed onto a structure of profilin : actin ( PDB ID code 2PBD ) ( 39 ) to produce models of the profilin : actin : T β 4 tricomplexes ( Fig . 2 B and Fig . S3 ) . In these models , the N - terminal helices of T β 4 ( Asp5 - Lys11 for the fully bound and Pro4 - Lys11 for the T β 4N ) fit into the pocket between profilin and actin , Table 1 .

Thus , the T β 4 : actin structures seem to be compatible with ternary complex formation . Another prominent feature of the overlaid structures is the conformational difference between the profilin - and T β 4 - bound actins , analogous to the observed difference between the native and T β 4 - bound actins ( Fig . S3 C and D ) . Specifically , binding of the C - terminal helix of T β 4 reduces the distance between sub - domains 2 and 4 and increases the distance between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin . In contrast , profilin binding does not produce a closure of the cleft between subdomains 2 and 4 of actin but slightly reduces the distance between subdomains 1 and 3 ( 39 ) . This con - formational difference in actin is in line with the hypothesis that profilin and T β 4 mutually influence their interactions with actin through allosteric effects ( 40 ) . This allosteric mechanism was fur - ther explored by fluorescence anisotropy and MD simulations . Fluorescence Anisotropy Reveals Steric and Allosteric Components of T β 4 / Profilin Exchange . The newly solved T β 4 – actin structures and their apparent compatibility with profilin binding necessitated a systematic investigation of the contributions of the distal N ter - minus of T β 4 and the allosteric mechanism in the exchange of bound actin by T β 4 and profilin . Fluorescence anisotropy mea - surements were used with a series of N - terminally truncated T β 4 peptides . Table 2 summarizes the affinities of the full - length and truncated versions of T β 4 for actin and the profilin : actin complex . The dissociation constant ( K d ) of full - length T β 4 for actin is in good agreement with reported values ( 23 , 33 , 38 ) . In support of the structures , removal of the first three residues , Ser1 - Asp2 - Lys3 , of T β 4 does not significantly affect the affinity for actin . Truncation beyond Pro4 reduces the binding strength of T β 4 , which may be attributed to disruption of the relatively short N - terminal helix of T β 4 . Exchange of the bound actin between T β 4 and profilin was measured by the decrease in the fluorescence anisotropy of labeled T β 4 peptides with increasing concentrations of profilin ( Fig . 2 C ) . These data fit well to the model where the exchange proceeds through the ternary complex of profilin : actin : T β 4 ( 38 ) using a single K d of 0 . 2 μ M for profilin : actin determined by isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) ( Fig . 2 D ) . For both the full - length T β 4 and the peptide truncated to Pro4 , there is an ∼ 25 - fold reduction in their affinity for profilin : actin with respect to actin alone ( Table 2 ) , which is comparable with the 10 - to 14 - fold reductions reported elsewhere Fig . 2 . T β 4 / profilin exchange of their bound actin . ( A ) Competition between profilin and T β 4 visualized by TIRF microscopy . Preformed actin filaments stained with rhodamine phalloidin ( magenta ) were immobilized on the surface of the flow cell . Newly formed actin filaments were visualized by BODIPY FL - labeled actin ( green ; 30 % labeling ) . Because of inefficient incorporation of rhodamine phalloidin at the barbed end of the preformed filaments , dual - color single filaments appear to be disconnected at the magenta – green junction .

S3 ) predict that trun - cating the N terminus of T β 4 to , possibly , Asp5 or more confidently , Met6 would eliminate direct conflicts between T β 4 and profilin . The difference in affinity of these peptides for profilin : actin narrows compared with actin but is nevertheless apparent . Hence , we con - clude that the flexible N - terminal Ser1 - Lys3 and the more rigid Pro4 and Asp5 of T β 4 contribute favorably to the exchange process . There is also an allosteric component clearly shown by the Met6 truncate of T β 4 , which can dissociate profilin in the absence of direct clashes between profilin and T β 4 in their actin - bound forms . In this situation , exchange proceeds through a pure allosteric mechanism , in which the sequestering proteins stabilize different conformations of actin that are suboptimal for the other sequestering protein . MD Simulations Disclose Conformational Landscapes of T β 4 / Profilin Exchange . To better understand how profilin and T β 4 modulate the structure of actin , ∼ 1 . 0 - μ s - long MD simulations were carried out on actin , T β 4 : actin , profilin : actin , and profilin : actin : T β 4 starting from the ATP - bound actin conformation taken from the fully bound T β 4 : actin structure ( Table S1 ) . Independent trajectories were generated and analyzed using PCA to extract correlated motions of actin from the matrix of atomic fluctuations . Rep - resentative experimental actin structures were included in the PCA to provide quantitative comparison between simulations and experiment ( Fig . 3 ) . The first few eigenvectors or principal compo - nents ( PCs ) obtained through this analysis represent the main large - scale functional motions of actin ( Fig . S4 ) . The first PC ( PC1 ) cor - responds to twisting / flattening of the molecule , whereas the second PC ( PC2 ) describes opening / closing of the nucleotide binding cleft ( Fig . 3 A ) . Fig . 3 B shows 2D projections of the first two PCs of actin in different molecular environments , which were captured by MD - generated structural ensembles . Actin alone quickly deviated from its starting structure ( T β 4 : actin conformation ) to sample a rela - tively broad energy basin characterized by larger values of PC1 and lower values of PC2 , indicating a closed and twisted conformation . This region of the conformational landscape largely corresponds to theone occupiedbymostexperimentalunbound G - actinstructures ( Fig . 3 C ) . Inclusion of profiling stabilized actin in its more open con - formations and increased its flexibility ( as judged by the rms fluc - tuation on C α positions ) ( Fig . S5 C ) . The conformational landscape ofprofilin - boundactinrevealsthepresence ofmultiple energybasins corresponding to the widely open ( 1HLU - like ) , slightly open ( 2BTF - like ) , and G - actin – like conformers , which is in striking contrast with G - actin and consistent with previous reports ( 41 ) .

The two actin molecules in the newly solved T β 4N : actin structure reported in this paper have different conformations , which are labeled as 4PL8 _ A ( with bound T β 4N ) and 4PL8 _ B ( Fig . S2 A ) . E4600 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1412271111 Xue et al . PC2 shows a significant correlation between the strength of the in - teraction and the opening of the actin nucleotide binding cleft by profilin ( Fig . S5 E ) . Inclusion of T β 4 restricted the actin conformations to those with narrower distances between subdomains 2 and 4 , leading to a landscape with a deep , single - energy minimum . The location of this global minimum is very close to the crystal structure and corre - sponds to an actin conformer locked in a closed , less twisted state than G - actin . Comparison with experimental structures in which the pointed face is not capped , such as the T β 4N with skeletal actin ( Fig . 3 C ) , indicates that binding of the C - terminal helix from T β 4 induces a small but significant closure and flattening of actin through direct intermolecular contacts . Models of the ternary complex were also subjected to MD . These models were stable during the time course of the simulation and showed a reduced overall flexibility of the actin molecule compared with profilin : actin or G - actin but somewhat higher than T β 4 : actin ( Fig . S5 C ) . The N terminus of T β 4 displays a more restricted movement in the ternary complex compared with T β 4 : actin because of the positioning of profilin ( Fig . S5 A and B ) , suggesting an unfavorable entropy loss of the N terminus of T β 4 in forming the complex . PCA indicates that simultaneous binding of T β 4 and profilin onto actin results in a relative broadening of the conformational landscape without significantly altering the location of the energy minimum of the actin – T β 4 complex . Com - parison with profilin : actin and T β 4 : actin clearly suggests that pro - filin and T β 4 simultaneously exert competing effects on the dy - namics of actin and that T β 4 is able to inhibit profilin - induced cleft opening by maintaining tight contacts with actin through its C - terminal α - helix . This effect is evident in the plot of the number of atomic contacts between actin and profilin ( in the ternary complex ) vs . PC2 , where MD simulated structures cluster in a region of space characterized by low values for PC2 ( Fig . S5 F ) . Comparison be - tween the distribution of profilin – actin contacts in profilin : actin and profilin : actin : T β 4 shows a shift of the main population of struc - tures toward less atomic contacts in the ternary complex , which in - dicates a slight destabilization of profilin : actin by T β 4 ( Fig . S5 D and F ) , consistent with experimental affinity measurements ( Table 2 ) . Discussion Importance of the C - Terminal Helix of T β 4 . The T β 4 : actin structures described here reveal that the presence and absence of the bound T β 4 C - terminal helix correlate with significant conformational changes of actin . To further understand these changes , we com - pared the fully bound T β 4 : actin structure with the structure of actin in complex with a chimera consisting of gelsolin domain 1 ( G1 ) fused to the C - terminal portion of T β 4 ( G1 - T β 4 ; PDB ID code 1T44 ) ( 24 ) . Despite differences in species and isoform , the con - formation of cytoplasmic Pichia actin in the T β 4 : actin complex resembles that of rabbit muscle actin complexed with G1 - T β 4 ( Fig . S6 A ) , with a closed pointed face cleft . In contrast , G1 alone [ in the absence of the T β 4 C - terminal α - helix ; examples are 1P8Z ( 42 ) , 2FF3 ( 26 ) , and 1YAG ( 43 ) ] slightly widens the barbed face groove of bound actin ( as seen in 1T44 ) but fails to induce the closure of the pointed face cleft ( Fig . S6 B ) . In good agreement , the PCA shows that , although the structures of G1 : actin cluster with the T β 4N : actin as well as some uncomplexed actins , the fully bound T β 4 : actin and G1 - T β 4 : actin structures cluster together in a distinct region ( Fig . 3 C ) . Thus , the T β 4 C - terminal helix is a sensor and stabilizer of the closed pointed face cleft conformation of actin . Mechanism of G - Actin Sequestration . To understand the mechanism by which T β 4 sequesters G - actin , the two structures of T β 4 : actin were overlaid onto the F - actin structure ( PDB ID code 3MFP ) ( 32 ) . These structures were analyzed by PISA to locate dual - role surface residues on actin that are involved in both binding T β 4 in the T β 4 : actin complex and contacting adjacent protomers in the filament . The fully bound C - terminal α - helix of T β 4 and the first two residues of its N - terminal α - helix sterically prevent the com - plex from joining the barbed and pointed ends of a filament ( Fig . 4 ) , respectively , and there are , indeed , many dual - role residues at both the barbed and pointed faces of actin . In addition to the steric exclusion and large competitive binding surface , there also seem to be entropic and allosteric effects that aid T β 4 sequestration of G - actin . The entropic effect originates from the flexible , distal N terminus of T β 4 , which would become more restricted in movement when the T β 4 : actin complex ap - proaches the pointed end of a filament , analogous to the observa - tions in the MD simulation of the profilin : actin : T β 4 tricomplex . Evidence for the allosteric effect includes ( i ) although not as ef - fective as full - length T β 4 , truncated T β 4s ( Ser1 - Glu24 or Ser1 - Ser30 ) that lack the C - terminal α - helix reduce the amount of F - actin during salt - induced polymerization ( 34 ) ; ( ii ) in the absence of a possible steric effect and competitive binding site , profilin and many barbed - end elongating WH2s ( see below ) reduce the barbed - end association rate of actin ( 23 , 44 ) ; and ( iii ) T β 4 - sequestered actin is in a conformation that is different from the conformations of un - complexed G - and F - actin ( Fig . 3 C ) . T β 4 and WH2 Motifs . To compare the modes of actin interaction be - tween T β 4 and the WH2 motifs , the available WH2 : actin structures were superimposed on the T β 4 : actin structures , with the WH2 from WASPshownasanexample ( Fig . S6 C ) . Themajor observationis that none of the WH2s have a helix that makes extensive interactions with the pointed face of actin , and indeed , many WH2s do not even show a stable interaction with actin beyond the central LKKT motif . The T β 4 C - terminal α - helix is , therefore , the likely major determinant of actin monomer sequestration . Despite being more similar at the barbed face of actin , T β 4 is distinguished from the WH2s by its short Fig . 4 . Mechanism of G - actin sequestration by T β 4 . The Pichia actin – T β 4 structure in Fig . 1 was overlaid onto an F - actin model with five protomers generated with PDB ID code 3MFP . ( A ) Front and side views of superimposed models .

S5 A ) . As discussed earlier , the shorter N - terminal α - helix and theflexibleleadingresiduesarefunctionallysignificantinthattheyarecompatiblewiththeformationoftheprofilin : actin : T β 4 complex . Many actin polymerization and nucleation factors contain WH2 motifs that are preceded by proline - rich sequences ( PRSs ) , which recruit profilin : actin ( 3 , 5 ) . The currently available crystal struc - tures of WH2s suggest that their comparatively longer N - terminal helices are not compatible with the formation of a relatively stable ternary complex as observed for profilin : actin : T β 4 ( 39 ) . Hence , the mechanism by which adjacent PRS and WH2 motifs contrib - ute to polymerization remains open to question . The process may proceed through either ( i ) an unstable ternary complex , in which profilin and WH2 are bound to the same actin , or alternatively , ( ii ) a noncanonical WH2 : actin interaction in the ternary complex that allows the WH2 to gain access to the actin in the PRS - bound profilin : actin , which was manifested by the WH2 - like G - actin – binding ( GAB ) motif of VASP ( 39 ) . Functionally , T β 4 / WH2 motifs have been broadly classified into T β 4 - like peptides that disallow their bound actin to join either end of a filament or barbed - end elongators that participate in barbed - but not pointed - end elongation , albeit at a reduced rate compared with uncomplexed G - actin ( 23 ) . The barbed - end elongating WH2s are , thus , weak sequesterers for barbed - end elongation , which correlates well with the absence of a C - terminal α - helix in their actin - bound structures . Given the resemblance between the T β 4N : actin and the WH2 : actin structures ( Fig . 3 C , purple cluster ) , it seems plausible that T β 4 may also become a barbed - end elongator on dissociation of its C - terminal α - helix . Indeed , it has been shown that mutations in the C - terminal portion or the linker region of T β 4 can increase the dynamics of the C - terminal portion of T β 4 and effectively switch T β 4 into a barbed - end elongator ( 23 , 25 ) . Scheme for Actin Binding and Exchange . The two modes of T β 4 in complex with actin ( fully bound vs . T β 4N ) and the concomitant conformational changes on bound actin suggest that T β 4 binds to actin through a two - step process : initially , the N - terminal portion interacts followed by the C - terminal portion . This hypothesis is supported in two ways : ( i ) the isolated N - terminal portion of T β 4 can bind actin , whereas the isolated C - terminal portion cannot ( 9 , 33 ) , and ( ii ) for many actin - bound WH2 - T β 4 hybrid peptides , their C - terminal portion is more dynamic than their N - terminal portion ( 23 ) . Based on this hypothesis and the K d values measured here and by others ( 9 ) , we constructed a reaction scheme for the actin exchange between profilin and T β 4 ( Fig . 5 ) . By comparing the apparent K d values for the fully bound vs . the K d values for the T β 4N ( measured with Ser1 - Lys25 of T β 4 ) ( 9 ) , the scheme reveals that the C - terminal helix of T β 4 is critical in stabilizing the as - sociation between T β 4 and actin in both T β 4 : actin and profilin : actin : T β 4 , leading to 10 - to 20 - fold increase in the binding af - finity . The three K d values ( 0 . 2 , 2 . 6 , and 4 . 9 μ M ) for profilin binding to uncomplexed actin , T β 4N : actin , and fully bound T β 4 : actin , respectively , show both the steric and the allosteric effects for the T β 4 / profilin exchange . Using this scheme , we calculated the equilibrium concen - trations of all of the species in a system containing T β 4 , profilin , and ATP – G - actin ( Table 3 ) . The first four scenarios in Table 3 correspond to the conditions used for the TIRF experiments ( Fig . 2 A ) . The concentrations for the polymerization - competent species ( A and AP ) are below 0 . 1 μ M when the total actin concentration is low ( scenarios 1 and 2 ) or when profilin is absent ( scenarios 1 and 3 ) . However , at suitable concentrations of the individual compo - nents , profilin can effectively turn the T β 4 - sequestered inactive system into a polymerization - competent system ( scenarios 4 vs . 3 ) , which is in good agreement with the TIRF experiments . Consequences for Filament Elongation . To assess the in vivo con - centrations of all of the species depicted in Fig . 5 and their contributions to actin polymerization , we calculated , in scenario 5 of Table 3 , their equilibrium concentrations using the esti - mated in vivo concentrations for profilin , T β 4 , and ATP – G - actin ( 45 ) . The benefit of ternary complex formation is illustrated by comparing scenario 5 with scenario 6 , in which ternary complex formation was purposely ignored . Clearly , the ternary system is more efficient in lowering the combined concentration of poly - merization - competent species ( sum of A and AP ) . Because G - actin is not required to dissociate during T β 4 / profilin ex - change , spontaneous nucleation is minimized . Moreover , the ternary complex reduces the concentrations of free profilin , profilin : actin complex , and hence , filament barbed ends associ - ated with profilin , all of which will impact on the actin dynamics regulations in vivo . Based on this reaction scheme , a small fraction of the T β 4 : actin and profilin : actin : T β 4 complexes may temporarily lose the T β 4 C - terminal α - helix interaction with the actin protomer be - cause of the allosteric action of actin ( ATn and APTn in Fig . 5 ) . Without the steric hindrance provided by the C - terminal α - helix of T β 4 , the actin in these complexes would be sequestered only by the allosteric mechanism discussed earlier . This loss of steric hindrance seems to impair the capability of T β 4 as a G - actin sequesterer , turning it into a barbed - end elongator ( see above ) . However , added security is present to counteract such an effect in vivo , in which actin filament elongation is often mediated by polymerization machineries , such as VASP ( 46 ) and formins ( 47 ) . These proteins recruit profilin : actin complexes through their PRS , making T β 4N : actin ( without profilin ) a less favorable candidate . Profilin : actin : T β 4N ( APTn in Fig . 5 and Table 3 ) accounts for only about 14 % of the polymerization - competent pool of actin ( A and AP ) . Moreover , this complex does not seem to be compatible with the VASP - mediated elongation process , because T β 4N would mask the binding site of the GAB motif of VASP ( 39 ) . Lastly , we speculate that the allosteric sequestration of G - actin by T β 4N , although quite possibly being attenuated , would not be completely eliminated by the presence of profilin , and consequently , the profilin : actin : T β 4N complex , like many barbed - end elongating WH2 : actin complexes , would not be as competent as profilin : actin in actin polymerization . Taken together , we suggest that , for both T β 4N : actin and profilin : actin : T β 4N , their con - tributions to in vivo actin polymerization will be insignificant . The facts that T β 4 and profilin are sensitive to and can alter the conformation of their bound actin suggest that similar allosteric mechanisms will be invoked during filament elongation . G - actin bound to profilin or barbed - end elongating WH2s is able to join the Fig . 5 . Reaction scheme of actin binding and exchange by T β 4 and profilin .

After it is bound , the actin – actin inter - actions would induce the G - to F - actin structural transition in the newly incorporated protomer away from the optimal confor - mations that favor binding of profilin or WH2s , leading to the release of bound profilin or WH2 and an uncapped barbed end ready for the incorporation of the next actin protomer . Indeed , there have been continued efforts in the literature aimed at elu - cidating the interplay between profilin , G - actin , and the barbed end of F - actin ( 44 , 48 – 52 ) . A recent report detailing kinetic rates at the single - filament level ( 53 ) strongly suggests that the con - formations of protomers at the barbed end of F - actin differ from those of G - actin . Thus , allosteric effects reduce , in a nucleotide - dependent manner , the affinity of profilin for the barbed end of F - actin relative to G - actin . Additional structural data are needed to elucidate the conformations of the barbed end of F - actin at high resolution to understand these allosteric mechanisms . Materials and Methods Proteins and Peptides . The coding sequence of the P . ( K . ) pastoris actin ( Uniprot accession no . Q9P4D1 ) was fused to a linker sequence ( 28 ) followed by human T β 4 ( Uniprot accession no . P62328 ) . This hybrid was then cloned into a modified pPICZc vector ( Invitrogen ) that encodes to the C terminus of the insert a human rhinovirus 3C ( HRV 3C ) protease recognition sequence , a StrepII tag , a tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease recognition sequence , and eight histidines . Protein production was achieved with the X - 33 P . pastoris strain ( Invitrogen ) according to the supplier ’ s protocols . Cells were lysed with the YeastBuster ( Novagen ) , and the clarified lysate was loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrapFF column attached to an AKTAxpress system ( GE Healthcare ) . After washing the column with 2 . 0 mM Tris , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 2 mM DTT , pH 7 . 6 ( Buffer A ) , His - tagged HRV 3C protease was injected to release the bound hybrid protein from the column . The hybrid protein was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex200 column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with Buffer A and concentrated to 15 mg / mL using a Vivaspin 20 concentrator ( Sartorius ) with a 30 - kDa molecular mass cutoff . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified according to previously published proto - cols ( 54 ) followed by gel filtration . Human profilin I was cloned into the pSY5 vector that features an N - terminal His - tag and an HRV 3C protease recognition sequence ( 55 ) and purified by a two - step protocol using His - TrapFF and Superdex75 columns . Full - length and N - terminal truncated versions of T β 4 , with an extra cys - teine introduced at their C terminus , were cloned into the pNIC28 - Bsa4 vector ( GenBank accession no . EF198106 ) by ligation - independent cloning ( 56 ) . The pNIC28 - Bsa4 vector features an N - terminal His - tag and a linker that can be completely removed by TEV . An extra glycine is added to both the Ser1 ( full - length ) and Pro4 to mimic the acetylation in vivo for the former and facilitate TEV protease cleavage for the latter . These constructs were transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) cells ( Invitrogen ) , and protein production was induced using the autoinduction media ( 57 ) . Cells were lysed by sonication , and the recombinant peptides were purified by a two - step protocol with AKTAxpress using HisTrapFF and Superdex30 columns . In some cases , the His - tag on the peptides was cleaved off by incubating the peptides in so - lution at 4 °C with His - tagged TEV protease and passing the reaction mixture through the HisTrapFF column again to capture the tag and the TEV pro - tease . The peptides were concentrated to 10 mg / mL using a Vivaspin 15R concentrator with a 2 - kDa molecular mass cutoff . In an effort to characterize the lysine - rich region of Cobl in actin binding , hybrid proteins comprising this lysine - rich region and different WH2 / T β 4 motifs were constructed . One such hybrid protein was made by joining residues S1 - K16 of T β 4 , F1095 - D1106 of Cobl , and full - length T β 4 ( S1 - S43 ) . This hybrid was cloned into the pSY5 vector , produced , and purified as the T β 4 peptides . The amino acid sequence after HRV 3C protease cleavage is GPSDKPDMAEIEKFDKSKFKPVVQRPVPKDSDKPDMAEIEKFDKSKLKKTETQEKNPL - PSKETIEQEKQAGES , with the residues from T β 4 underlined . The first two extra residues are from the recognition sequence of HRV 3C . Crystallization , Data Collection , and Structure Solution . Crystallization of T β 4 : actin was performed using the sitting - drop vapor diffusion method in 1 . 0 - μ L drops containing a 1 : 1 ( vol / vol ) mixture of protein solution and precipitant . Crystals for the K . pastoris actin – T β 4 hybrid were obtained by mixing the protein stock at 15 mg / mL in Buffer A with 0 . 1 M sodium acetate ( pH 4 . 5 ) and 15 % ( wt / vol ) PEG 4000 at 25 °C . The T β 4 – Cobl hybrid was first incubated at 4 °C in a molar ratio of 1 . 2 : 1 with rabbit skeletal muscle actin in Buffer A , concentrated to 10 mg / mL , and mixed with 0 . 1 M citric acid ( pH 3 . 5 ) and 15 % ( wt / vol ) PEG 3350 at 15 °C . The crystals were transferred to the pre - cipitant solution supplemented with 20 % ( vol / vol ) glycerol before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen . X - ray diffraction data were collected at beamline BL13B1 on an Area Detection System Corporation Quantum - 315 CCD de - tector at the National Synchrotron Research Center . Data were indexed , scaled , and merged in HKL - 2000 ( 58 ) . Structures were solved by molecular replacement using Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin ( PDB ID code 1YAG ) ( 43 ) or rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( PDB ID code 1T44 ) ( 24 ) as models in PHASER ( 59 ) . The solution was subjected to repetitive rounds of restrained refinement in PHENIX ( 60 ) and manual building in COOT ( 61 ) . TLS param - eters generated by the TLSMD web server ( 62 ) were included in the final round of refinement . The CCP4 program suite ( 63 ) was used for coordinate manipulations . The structures were validated with Molprobity ( 64 ) . Back - bone dihedral angles of the final models that fall within the outliers and the allowed and favored regions of the Ramachandran plots are 0 % , 1 . 7 % , and 98 . 3 % for the P . pastoris actin – T β 4 hybrid structure and 0 % , 1 . 0 % , and 99 . 0 % for the T β 4N : muscle actin structure , respectively . All of the structure - related figures were prepared with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System ( DeLano Scientific LLC ) . TIRF Microscopy . Preparation of sample flow cells was based on published protocols with minor modifications ( 65 ) . Briefly , glass slides ( 75 × 25 mm , 1 . 0 mm thick ) and glass coverslips ( 40 × 24 mm , no . 1 , 0 . 13 to 0 . 17 mm thick ) from Fisher Scientific were sonicated 30 min each in 2 % ( vol / vol ) Hellmanex II solution ( Hellma GmbH & Co . ) , 1 . 0 M NaOH , and absolute ethanol , with extensive rinses in between with deionized water . After drying with com - pressed air , the cleaned coverslips were derivatized by coating one side with 80 μ L2 mg / mL mPEG - silane ( molecularweight = 2 , 000 ; Nanocs Inc . ) and 2 μ g / mL biotin - PEG - silane ( molecular weight = 3 , 400 ; Nanocs Inc . ) in 80 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol ( pH adjusted to 2 . 0 by HCl ) and baked at 60 °C for 16 h . The derivatized coverslips were then rinsed and dried again . Flow cells were assembled by placing three parallel strips of double - sided tape ( 30 mm × 6 mm × 120 μ m ) onto a cleaned and dried glass slide with ∼ 3 - mm spacing between the strips . A derivatized coverslip was then positioned over the strips of double - sided tape ( with the coated side facing the tape ) , pro - ducing two separate flow chambers per slide . TIRF images were obtained using a Nikon TE2000 - E inverted micro - scope following published procedures ( 65 , 66 ) . Briefly , the flow cell was first incubated with 1 % BSA in Tris - buffered saline ( 50 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 6 ) followed by 100 μ g / mL streptavidin in Tris - buffered saline Table 3 .

Unlabeled rabbit skeletal actin with 0 . 2 % biotinylation was polymerized in the presence of 40 μ M rhodamine phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) by the addition of equal vol - ume 2 × TIRF buffer , and the mixture was introduced into the flow cell . After ∼ 7 min , the flow cell was washed two times with 1 × TIRF buffer so that only the filaments attached to the surface of the coverslip remained . BODIPY FL maleimide ( Molecular Probes ) - labeled actin ( 30 % fluorophore labeling and no biotinylation in 1 × TIRF buffer ) was then introduced into the flow cell in the absence or presence of T β 4 and / or profilin . Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements . His - tagged T β 4 peptides were ex - changed into 20 mM phosphate ( pH 7 . 0 ) with PD - 10 desalting columns ( GE Healthcare ) and labeled with BODIPY TMR C5 - maleimide ( Invitrogen ) according to the supplier ’ s protocol . Nickel - Sepharose High Performance Beads ( GE Healthcare ) were added to the reaction mixture to capture the peptides and facilitate removal of unattached dye by repeated washes . The labeled peptides were eluted with the phosphate buffer containing 250 mM imidazole , and the imidazole concentration was lowered by di - lution . Removal of His - tag by TEV protease was conducted as mentioned previously for the unlabeled T β 4 peptides . The final concentrations of the peptides were quantified by measuring their absorbance at 544 nm and a molar extinction coefficient of 60 , 000 cm − 1 M − 1 . Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were conducted using a Tecan Safire II plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 530 and 570 nm , respectively , and black 96 - well nonbinding flat - bottom plates ( Greiner ) with a total volume of 100 μ L in the wells . Buffer A was used throughout the experiments . The peptides were fixed at 0 . 2 μ M . For the profilin competition assays , the actin was at 2 . 4 μ M . Fluorescence anisotropy data for T β 4 binding to actin were fitted with Eq . 1 , and those for the ex - change of bound actin between T β 4 and profilin were fitted with Eqs . 2 and 3 that were originally derived for T β 4 : actin : latrunculin A ( 67 ) : r − r f r b − r f = ð K dT + ½ A 0 (cid:2) + ½ T 0 (cid:2)Þ − ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð K dT + ½ A 0 (cid:2) + ½ T 0 (cid:2)Þ 2 − 4 ½ A 0 (cid:2)½ T 0 (cid:2) q 2 , [ 1 ] r − r f r b − r f = 1 − K dPT K dPT + ½ A (cid:2) K dPT K dT + ½ A (cid:2)½ P 0 (cid:2) ½ A (cid:2) + K dP , and [ 2 ] ½ A (cid:2) = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ð K dP − ½ A 0 (cid:2) + ½ P 0 (cid:2)Þ 2 + 4 ½ A 0 (cid:2) K dP q − ð K dP − ½ A 0 (cid:2) + ½ P 0 (cid:2)Þ 2 , [ 3 ] where r is the measured fluorescence anisotropy ; r f and r b are fluorescence anisotropy values for free T β 4 and T β 4 in complex with either actin or profilin : actin , respectively ; [ A 0 ] , [ T 0 ] , and [ P 0 ] are initial concentrations of actin , T β 4 , and profilin , respectively ; [ A ] is free actin concentration ; K dT and K dP are dis - sociation constants for T β 4 : actin and profilin : actin complexes , respectively ; and K dPT is the dissociation constant of T β 4 from the ternary complex . ITC . ITC measurements were performed with a MicroCal Auto - iTC200 System ( GE Healthcare ) in a buffer containing 5 mM Pipes , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ( pH 7 . 5 ) . Profilin at 130 μ M was titrated in 10 - μ L injections into 200 μ L 10 μ M actin at 25 °C . The duration of each injection was 4 s , with an interval of 2 min between injections . Data analysis was carried out with ORIGIN software , giving a K dP of 0 . 23 μ M . MD Simulations . All MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS 4 software package ( 68 ) and the AMBER99SB - ILDN * force field ( 69 , 70 ) . At the beginning of each simulation , the protein was immersed in a box of ex - tended simple point charge water . A minimum distance of 1 . 0 nm was ap - plied between any protein atom and the edges of the box . Sodium ions were added to reach charge neutrality . Long - range electrostatics was treated with the particle mesh Ewald summation ( 71 ) . Bond lengths were constrained using the P - LINCS algorithm ( 72 ) . The integration time step was 2 fs . The v - rescale thermostat ( 73 ) and the Parrinello – Rahman barostat ( 74 ) were used to maintain a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 atm . Each system was energy - minimized using 5 , 000 steps of steepest descent and equili - brated for 200 ps with restrained protein heavy atoms before the beginning of the production simulation . For each system , three independent pro - duction simulations were obtained by using different initial velocities . The aggregated simulation time was ∼ 4 μ s . Calculations of rmsds , root mean square fluctuations , atomic distances , and PCA were carried out using GROMACS routines . In Silico Calculations . The procedure for in silico calculations was similar to that reported ( 45 ) . Briefly , kinetic models based on the reaction scheme ( Fig . 5 ) were constructed in Vcell ( 75 ) . Reaction rates constants were arbitrarily set to 1 . 0 for forward reactions and the measured K d values for reverse reac - tions . The initial concentrations were set according to the experimental conditions used for TIRF or the estimated in vivo values ( 45 ) . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . B . X . thanks Drs . Joma K .
