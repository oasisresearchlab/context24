Garcia a and Rob Phillips b , 1 Departments of a Physics and b Applied Physics , California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , CA 91125 Edited * by Curtis G . Callan , Princeton University , Princeton , NJ , and approved May 26 , 2011 ( received for review October 18 , 2010 ) We present a quantitative case study of transcriptional regulation in which we carry out a systematic dialogue between theory and mea - surement for an important and ubiquitous regulatory motif in bacte - ria , namely , that of simple repression . This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter . From the theory point of view , this motif is described by a single gene regula - tion function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally . The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strains with a large variation in repressor copy number . The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change ( spanning nearly four orders of magnitude ) and repressor copy number ( spanning about two orders of magnitude ) . The predic - tions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots . The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input – output relation for simple repres - sion , aprecisedeterminationoftheinvivobindingenergiesforDNA – repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites , and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli . physicalbiology | thermodynamicmodels | proteincopynumber | lac operon I t is now possible not only to make quantitative , precise , and reproducible measurements on the response of a variety of dif - ferent genetic regulatory architectures , but also to synthesize novel architectures de novo . These successes have engendered hopeful analogies between the circuits found in cells and those that are the basis of many familiar electronic devices ( 1 , 2 ) . However , in many cases , unlike the situation with the electronic circuit analogy , our understanding of these circuits is based upon enlightened empir - icism rather than systematic , quantitative knowledge of the input – output relations of the underlying genetic circuits . Regulatory biology has shed light on the space – time response of a wide variety of these genetic circuits . Examples range from the complex regulatory networks that govern processes such as em - bryonic development ( 3 , 4 ) to the synthetic biology setting of building completely new regulatory circuits in living cells ( 5 ) . In particular , the dissection of genetic regulatory networks is resulting in the elucidation of ever more complex wiring diagrams ( see , as an example , ref . 6 ) . With these advances it is becoming increasingly dif ﬁ cult to develop intuition for the behavior of these networks in space and time . In addition , often , the diagrams used to depict these regulatory architectures make no reference to the census of the various molecular actors ( the intracellular number of polymerases , activators , repressors , inducers , etc . ) or to the quantitative details of their interactions that dictate their re - sponse . As a result , there is a growing need to put the description of these networks on a ﬁ rm quantitative footing . Often , the default description of regulatory response is offered by phenomenological Hill functions ( 7 – 12 ) , which in the case of repression have the form gene expression level ¼ α 1 þ ð½ R (cid:2) = K d Þ n þ β ; [ 1 ] where n is the Hill coef ﬁ cient that determines the sensitivity of the gene regulatory function , K d is a dissociation constant , and α and β are constants that determine the maximum and basal levels of expression , respectively . Although such descriptions might pro - vide a satisfactory ﬁ t of the data , they can deprive us of insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of a given regulatory response or , worse , can force us into thinking about the behavior of a given circuit in a way that is not faithful to the known architecture . Alternatively , using thermodynamic models , it has been shown for a wide class of regulatory architectures that for each and every circuit , one can derive a corresponding “ governing equation ” that provides the fold change in gene expression as a function of the relevant regulatory tuning variables ( 13 – 15 ) . The goal of our work is to carry out a detailed experimental characterization of the predictions posed by one such governing equation for the regulatory motif describing simple repression ( Fig . 1 A ) in which a repressor can bind to a site overlapping the promoter , resulting in the shutting down of expression of the associated gene . This is a particularly fundamental case study because in Escherichia coli alone , there are > 400 circuits that are regulated by different transcription factors that repress by binding to a single site in the vicinity of the promoter ( 16 ) . Indeed , simple repression and ac - tivation are often thought of as the elementary ingredients of a much more diverse range of real regulatory circuits ( 17 , 18 ) . As seen in Fig . 1 , the level of expression in circuits governed by simple repression can be tuned by several different parameters . One of the key tuning variables in nearly all regulatory and sig - naling networks is the numbers ( or concentrations ) of the rele - vant molecular players in the process of interest . We use the repressor number as one of the main tunable parameters in the experiments described below , with a 100 - fold range of different repressor counts considered . To explore our understanding of how this parameter dictates regulatory response , we need to know how many repressors our strains of interest harbor . A se - ries of beautiful recent experiments has made important progress in carrying out the molecular census , using a variety of clever methods . These molecular counts include the census of all actin - related proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells ( 19 ) , a count of essentially all the proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells ( 20 ) , a determination of the distribution of both lipids and pro - teins in synaptic vesicles ( 21 ) , and several counts of the proteins in E . coli ( 22 , 23 ) and other cell types as well ( 24 ) . Most relevant to the current work is a recent experiment using a ﬂ uctuation - based counting method to determine the number of transcription factors in E . coli that control a synthetic circuit of interest ( 10 ) . Our work adds a twist to protein census taking by using ther - modynamic models as a way to count the number of repressors in a simple regulatory motif . Quantitative control of the absolute number of transcription factors is seldom used in experiments that aim to dissect regu - latory architectures even though it is one of the main strategies to verify the predictions from thermodynamic models ( 13 – 15 ) .

However , the use of inducer molecules , although experimentally convenient , adds another layer of complexity to the modeling approach and has been systematically character - ized in only a few cases ( 11 ) . Recent measurements ( 10 , 23 , 27 – 31 , ) have also often focused on the variability or “ noise ” associated with transcriptional reg - ulation . Although there has been great recent interest in this gene expression variability , we argue that a crucial quantitative prerequisite to fully dissecting the properties of genetic networks is a viable description of their mean response , and any concep - tual frameworks used to describe the noise must ﬁ rst be consis - tent with these mean responses . In this work we test these thermodynamic models of transcrip - tional regulation by generating parameter - free predictions for the level of gene expression as a function of the regulatory tuning variables of the simple repression architecture . We show signi ﬁ - cant agreement between the theoretical description and the measurements over multiple orders of magnitudes of the inputs and outputs of the system . We conclude that through thermody - namic models we can accurately predict the level of regulation due to simple repression , opening the door to the design of synthetic genetic circuits where the level of gene expression can be tuned theoretically and to the better interpretation of the transcriptional response of naturally occurring circuits . Theory and Experimental Design Although our analysis should be relevant generically for simple repression , the reasoning behind our experiments is based upon a series of earlier measurements and calculations on the level of repression in the speci ﬁ c case of the lac operon ( 32 , 33 ) . In par - ticular , we consider the case where there is only a single speci ﬁ c binding site for the Lac repressor ( Fig . 1 ) . The wild - type lac operon wasrewired such that only themain operator was present and then , in turn , different strains were constructed in which the strength of that main operator was systematically weakened according to the progression Oid to O1 to O2 to O3 shown in Fig . S1 . Thermodynamic models assume that the processes leading to transcription initiation by RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) are in quasi - equilibrium . This assumption means that we can use the tools of statistical mechanics to describe the binding of RNA polymerase and transcription factors ( TFs ) to DNA . Further , the level of gene expression is assumed to be proportional to the probability that RNA polymerase is bound to the promoter of interest ( 13 , 34 ) . This probability is determined , in turn , by the interactions between polymerase and the promoter and competition for those binding sites by repressors . In Fig . 1 A we show the thermodynamic states and weights corresponding to a minimal model of the simple re - pression regulatory motif . In this simpli ﬁ ed model the promoter can be found in only one of three states : ( i ) empty , ( ii ) occupied by RNA polymerase , and ( iii ) occupied by Lac repressor . The par - tition function for this system is obtained by summing over the statistical weights of each of these states and is given by Z ¼ 1 | { z } promoter empty þ P N NS e − βΔε pd | ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ { zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ } RNA polymerase bound þ 2 R N NS e − βΔε rd | ﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ { zﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄﬄ } LacI bound ; [ 2 ] where P is the number of RNA polymerase molecules , R is the number of Lac repressor tetramers , and N NS ∼ 5 × 10 6 is the number of nonspeci ﬁ c DNA sites ( the length of the genome ) , corresponding to the reservoir for both molecules . β = ( k B T ) − 1 with k B being the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute tem - perature . The energies Δε pd ( RNA polymerase – DNA ) and Δε rd ( repressor – DNA ) correspond to the difference between speci ﬁ c and nonspeci ﬁ c binding for RNA polymerase and Lac repressor , respectively , where we make the simplifying assumption of a homogeneous nonspeci ﬁ c background . The factor of 2 in front of the number of Lac repressors stems from the fact that this molecule is a tetramer , a dimer of dimers , with two binding heads . Therefore , 2 R corresponds to the number of binding heads inside the cell . For a complete derivation of these terms , please refer to refs . 14 and 35 , SI Text and Fig . S2 . The probability of ﬁ nding RNA polymerase bound to the promoter is then given by p bound ¼ P N NS e − βΔε pd Z ; [ 3 ] where Z is the partition function de ﬁ ned in Eq . 2 . A much more convenient quantity to measure is the fold change or relative change in gene expression due to the presence of the transcrip - tion factor ; namely , fold change ¼ p bound ð R ≠ 0 Þ p bound ð R ¼ 0 Þ ¼ 1 þ P N NS e − βΔε pd 1 þ P N NS e − βΔε pd þ 2 R N NS e − βΔε rd : [ 4 ] The great advantage of this quantity is that it is easily accessible both theoretically and experimentally . It is unitless and can be measured by comparing the levels of gene expression ( in any ar - bitrary or absolute units ) when Lac repressor is present and absent . We de ﬁ ne this fold change in gene expression with respect to the absence of transcription factor and not with respect to a state where the transcription factor is fully induced such as in the presence of saturating concentrations of Isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . Using inducers would require us to consider the induction process explicitly ( 11 ) . In the case of a weak promoter such as lac UV5 used in this work ( ref . 15 and SI Text ) the term ð P = N NS Þ e − βΔε pd < < 1 .

The simple repression motif . ( A ) States and weights of the thermodynamic model describing this regulatory motif . We assume that Lac repressor sterically excludes RNA polymerase from the promoter , although that assumption is not critical to our analysis . P and R are the numbers of RNA polymerase and Lac repressor molecules inside the cell , respectively . N NS is the number of nonspeci ﬁ c sites , which we assume to be the size of the genome . Δε pd and Δε rd are the difference in energy be - tween being speci ﬁ cally and nonspeci ﬁ cally bound for RNA polymerase and Lac repressor , respectively . The difference in color in the repressor binding site denotes an overlap of the binding site with the promoter . ( B ) The tuning variables that can be varied in the model and controlled experimentally are the binding strength ( by changing the Lac repressor operator sequence ) and the number of Lac repressors ( by changing its mRNA ribosomal binding site ) . The effect of tuning these parameters on the fold change in gene expression is shown in the graphs . Note that stronger repressor binding corresponds to a larger fold change . For a detailed derivation of the expression and discussion of the assumptions used see SI Text and Fig .

In Fig . 1 B we show the predicted fold change as a function of these two experimentally accessible parameters . Alternatively , the binding of Lac repressor can be described by a dissociation constant , the concentration of Lac repressor for which the fold change in gene expression is 1 / 2 . This approach is explained in SI Text . Throughout the text we report both binding energies and approximate dissociation con - stants , although all of our measurements and analysis are built around binding energies and repressor numbers . Approximate concentrations and dissociation constants are provided merely as rough estimates for the purposes of comparison with literature values in which sometimes these quantities are favored . For details of the estimation of the concentrations and dissociation constants , see SI Text , Connecting Δε rd to K d . Earlier hints as to how simple repression plays out quantitatively were offered by Oehleret al . ( 32 , 33 ) whomeasuredthefold change in gene expression for constructs bearing each one of the four operators and for two different numbers of Lac repressor per cell . UsingEq . 5 orequivalentexpressions ( 15 , 36 ) , thebindingenergyof Lacrepressor to eachone oftheoperators can beestimated . It must be noted , though , that these original measurements were not per - formed with the intention of the kind of quantitative dissection advocated here and that therefore the uncertainties in the pa - rametersaresubstantial . In SIText , Figs . S3andS4 , andTableS1 , we giveadetailedanalysisoftheextenttowhichtheseearlierresultsareconsistentwithourowndata . Additionally , in SI Text and Fig . S5 we show that our results do not depend on the particular choice of quanti ﬁ cation protocol for our enzymatic reporter . Finally , as shown in SI Text and Table S2 , even if we replace our reporter with a ﬂ uorescent protein the results are essentially unaltered . For the measurements reported here , we created ∼ 30 strains of bacteria where we systematically tuned the number of repressors , using a recently developed scheme for controlling ribosomal bind - ing strength ( 37 ) . Although this scheme provides a rough expec - tation for the number of repressors in each one of those strains , we had no precise or accurate a priori knowledge of the actual in - tracellular numbers of Lac repressors . These strains bear reporter constructs regulated by simple repression such as those shown in Fig . S1 , for which we measure the fold change in gene expression . If we are to believe the input – output function from Eq . 5 , once we know the binding energy of the operator in question there is a direct and unequivocal relation between the fold change in gene expression and the number of repressor molecules . Testing these predictions requires an accurate and precise quanti ﬁ cation of the absolute levels of repressor inside the cell . In fact , we view this approach as a way to count molecules by inference by looking at levels of gene expression and passing these levels of expression through the theoretical ﬁ lter of Eq . 5 . In the following sections we test these parameter - free pre - dictions over a wide range of both expression and repressor numbers and show that they largely jibe with our experimental observations . The logic advocated here is that if Eq . 5 is shown to be predictive , it will open the door to creating synthetic gene regulatory circuits whose level of gene expression can be pre - cisely tuned a priori and to being able to predict the regulation of a particular promoter by just looking at its regulatory sequence . In addition , a predictive understanding of the input – output re - lation of these architectures will serve as a jumping - off point for the design and understanding of more complex circuits such as those involving DNA looping , cooperative repression , etc . ( 15 ) . Results Eq . 5 represents a provocatively simple expression purporting to describe the response of a bacterial cell to a wide variety of perturbations such as altering the DNA target sites ( with the K d s changing by three orders of magnitude or , equivalently , Δε rd changing by 7 K B T ) ( 15 , 36 , 38 , 39 ) and repressor copy numbers ( with the copy numbers changing by several orders of magni - tude ) . If we take this equation seriously , it implies that once we have determined the parameter Δε rd , there is a quantitative re - lation between the fold change in gene expression and the cor - responding number of Lac repressors . Namely , once we know one quantity we can predict the other . To exploit Eq . 5 we designed lac UV5 promoters with a single binding site for Lac repressor at the wild - type position of O1 . These promoters bore Oid , O1 , O2 , or O3 and controlled the expression of the enzymatic reporter gene lacZ ( Materials and Methods and Fig . S1 ) , although as reported in SI Text , we also examined many of the same constructs using ﬂ uorescence as well , resulting in nearly identical results . We integrated each one of these simple repression constructs such as the one shown in in Fig . 1 A in the chromosome of a strain bearing no Lac repressor and in six different strains that we systematically designed to express different constitutive levels of Lac repressor . As mentioned above , although we had a qualitative expectation about the number of Lac repressors present in each strain , we had no previous quan - titative information about that magnitude . Taking the Repressor Census Through Thermodynamic Models . We measured the fold change in gene expression of our simple re - pression constructs bearing the operators Oid , O1 , O2 , or O3 in the six different strain backgrounds we created . There are several different ways to explore the results in conjunction with Eq . 5 . As noted above , one scheme is to determine the absolute number of repressor molecules within one strain and to combine this with the measured fold change to obtain the in vivo binding energy for each of the different operators through Eq . 5 . With these binding en - ergies in hand , a way to put the predictability of the thermodynamic model on the stand is to predict the number of repressors in the other strains . An alternative concept is simply to use all of the fold - change and repressor count measurements and to see how well they agree with the functional form provided by Eq . 5 by making one global ﬁ t to the in vivo binding energy for each operator . Regardless of the scheme chosen it is necessary to possess an absolute count of the repressor number in each one of our strain backgrounds . Details of this determination are given below . To carry out the ﬁ rst scheme presented above we used strain RBS1027 as the basis of the calculation of the binding energies . The resulting fold change in gene expression for each operator in this strain background and the calculated binding energies are shown in Fig . 2 A . Using these binding energies we plot the fold change in gene expression as a function of binding energy for all strains and choices of operators in Fig . 2 B ( the corresponding absolute values of gene expression measured for each strain are shown in Fig . S6 ) . The data in Fig . 2 B are ﬁ tted to Eq . 5 to gen - erate a prediction for the number of repressors within each one of the ﬁ ve remaining strains . These predictions are shown in Fig . 2 C . Because the majority of our strains were created for this particular work , the resulting predicted cellular numbers cannot be compared with any external standard . However , strain HG104 expresses wild - type levels of repressor from the native lacI gene . Indeed , for this strain we predict 8 . 8 ± 0 . 8 repressor tetramers per cell , comparable to the previous and , to our knowledge , only available absolute measurement ( 40 ) . To bring the predictions of the model for simple repression to fruition we need to directly measure the number of repressors in each one of our six strains . We measured the in vivo number of Lac repressors in these six strains by performing quantitative immunoblots ( 19 , 41 , 42 ) from cell lysates such as those shown in Fig . 3 A . To get an absolute count of the amount of Lac repressor in each strain a series of dilutions of a puri ﬁ ed Lac repressor standard of a known concentration was used ( Fig . 3 B ) . Quanti ﬁ - cation of the luminescence of the immunoblots was performed using a cooled CCD camera . Care was taken to account for spatial nonuniformities in the light collection as depicted in Fig . 3 C . We can reliably detect a wide range of puri ﬁ ed Lac repressor stand - Garcia and Phillips PNAS | July 19 , 2011 | vol . 108 | no . 29 | 12175 S Y S T E M S B I O L O G Y ards using our immunoblots ( as low as 50 pg , corresponding to around ﬁ ve repressors per cell ) . This result increases our con ﬁ - dence in the method as a way of precisely quantifying protein counts in bulk even at very low levels ( Materials and Methods and Fig . 3 D ) . It is important to note , however , that counting methods based on puri ﬁ cation , such as immunoblots , have the inherent caveat that some proteins might have stayed behind in the dif - ferent fractions . Although we took action to reduce this effect , the results from immunoblots should be viewed as a lower bound on the actual number of proteins in vivo . Our predictions for the number of Lac repressors in each strain can now be compared with the direct measurements of this quantity , which are shown in Fig . 4 A . In Fig . 4 B we compare the predictions and direct measurements explicitly . The direct mea - surements are comparable to the predictions within experimen - tal error , giving us con ﬁ dence that the proposed input – output function from Eq . 5 appropriately describes the input – output properties of the simple repression regulatory motif . This result suggests in turn that once we know the binding energy for an operator , we have predictive power . Although this analysis yiel - ded results that are largely consistent between theory and ex - periment , it appears that we systematically underestimate the number of repressors in the two strains with the highest repressor number . The reader is referred to SI Text for a further discussion of these two strains . Direct Determination of the in Vivo Lac Repressor Binding Energies . The scheme for exploring the limits and validity of the thermo - dynamic model advocated in the previous section is based on using one strain to determine the binding energy of Lac repressor to its operator DNA . However , as noted earlier , an alternative ap - proach is to simply use the entirety of our data to evaluate global ﬁ ts of Eq . 5 to the data corresponding to a given operator . Implementation of this concept is shown in Fig . S7 B , where we combine all of our measurements to determine the best values of the different in vivo binding energies . On the other hand , one might choose to use the information about fold change and re - pressor copy number for one particular strain to derive the dif - ferent binding energies . This analysis can be done , in turn , for all strains created for this work in an analogous way to what we did with strain RBS1027 in the previous section . In Fig . 5 we compare such ﬁ ts with the binding energies that can be obtained from an - alyzing a single strain . Additionally , we show the energies obtained from the Oehler et al . data ( 33 ) ( SI Text and Fig . S8 ) and from Fig . S7 B for comparison . These multiple approaches for obtaining the binding energies , all leading to essentially compa - rable results ( for example , Fig . S7 A ) , increase our con ﬁ dence in the simple model of Eq . 5 and in the minimalist modeling phi - losophy used to obtain it as a quantitative and predictive tool . Finally , it is common in the theoretical treatment of experi - ments on transcriptional regulation to include a constant level of expression dubbed the “ leakiness ” . Such leakiness is usually un - HG104RBS1147RBS446RBS1027RBS11I 8 . 8 ± 0 . 8 40 ± 4 75 ± 2 N / A 270 ± 20 400 ± 50 Strain Prediction ( repressors / cell ) B A C OidO1O2O3 - 17 . 3 ± 0 . 2 - 15 . 8 ± 0 . 2 - 14 . 3 ± 0 . 2 - 10 . 0 ± 0 . 3 ( 0 . 6 ± 0 . 1 ) x 10 - 3 ( 2 . 8 ± 0 . 5 ) x 10 - 3 ( 12 ± 1 ) x 10 - 3 0 . 48 ± 0 . 05 Binding energy ( k B T ) Fold - change and binding energies obtained from strain RBS1027 Operator Fold - change 130 pM 0 . 6 nM 2 . 7 nM 200 nM Binding site energy ( k Approximate dissociation constant ( M ) B T ) Oid O1 O2 −18 −17 −16 −15 −14 −13 −12 −11 −10 −9 10 −4 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 −10 10 −9 10 −8 10 −7 10 −4 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 F o l d - c h a n g e O3 Approximatedissociationconstant Fig . 2 .

Discussion Theoretical models of gene expression , especially in bacteria , have reached a very high level of sophistication . Similarly , measure - ments of gene expression have come to the point where they are both reproducible and quantitative enough to serve as the basis for explicit attempts at confronting theory and experiment and to explore the merits of these theoretical perspectives as a conceptual framework for describing regulatory response . Indeed , such measurements have now reached the point where in our view it is no longer appropriate to use just words to describe them — they call for a theoretical response that is commensurate with the level of quantitative detail in the experiments themselves . To that end , we have undertaken a detailed study of one of the most important and fundamental regulatory building blocks found in living organisms from all three domains of life , namely , simple repression . Simple repression and its positive regulation counterpart , namely simple activation , serve as the paradigmatic building blocks of the much richer regulatory strategies that are used in the growing list of both natural and synthetic networks now being explored . In recent years , the governing equations characterizing the transcriptional response of these elementary regulatory building blocks and much more complicated assemblies of them have been worked out in detail using the ideas of statistical mechanics . The work described here provides a template for the kind of rich in - terplay between theory and experiment that should be demanded of these other networks as well . In particular , the governing equa - tions describing regulatory architectures feature certain key tuning variables that serve to elicit different biological responses . In the experiments described here , we have explored two of the elemen - tary tuning parameters that govern the simple repression motif , namely , the strength of the transcription factor binding sites and the molecular counts of the repressors themselves . We have shown that an input – output function for simple repression obtained from thermodynamic assumptions , which depends on those two tuning parameters , can indeed predict in a parameter - free manner the regulatory outcome over roughly four orders of magnitude in the transcriptional output . Using the thermodynamic model approach coupled tightly with precise measurements we have been able to perform a systematic quantitative dissection of the input – output relation for simple repression and believe that similar analyses should be carried out for each of the other governing equations describing key regula - tory motifs . As a by - product of these measurements , we have been able to make a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA – repressor interactions . In addition , these results provide a census of the repressor content for Lac repressor in E . coli over a large dynamic range ( roughly two orders of magnitude in repressor counts ) . The predictive power revealed by this model on the basis of a few parameters is one of the ﬁ rst steps toward having a standardized description of a regulatory archi - tecture on the basis of its microscopic parameters ( 1 , 2 ) . Hark - ening back to the electronic circuit analogy , the results presented here are analogous to illustrating that for a resistor there is a value for the resistance that is necessary and suf ﬁ cient to predict the current given the voltage . In our case speci ﬁ cation of the binding energy Δε rd is necessary and suf ﬁ cient to predict the fold change in gene expression given the number of repressors . Further characterization of this architecture should explore the role of promoter copy number and operator position as these ar - chitectural features are known to alter the expression pro ﬁ le as well ( 43 – 45 ) . In addition , with these insights in hand for the case of simple repression in the lac operon , it is now important to examine a suite of similar architectures in E . coli and other bacteria with the idea being to explore the extent to which the successes found in this case can be expected to apply to other genes . Materials and Methods DNA Constructs and Strains . The construction of all plasmids and strains is described in detail in SI Text . In short , plasmids pZS25O1 + 11 , pZS25O2 + 11 , pZS25O3 + 11 , and pZS25Oid + 11 have a lac UV5 promoter controlling the expression of a LacZ reporter as shown schematically in Fig . S1 . Plasmid pZS3 * 1 - lacI expresses Lac repressor off of a p LtetO - 1 promoter ( 46 ) . The ribosomal binding site of this construct was weakened following ref . 37 , using site - directed mutagenesis ( Quikchange II ; Stratagene ) in order to generate constructs expressing LacI at different levels as described in SI Text and Table S3 . The E . coli strains used in this experiment are shown in Table S4 . HG105 is wild - type E . coli ( MG1655 ) with a complete deletion of the lacIZYA genes . HG104 is also wild - type E . coli with a deletion of the lacZYA genes . We therefore expect strain HG104 to express wild - type levels of Lac repressor . Reporter constructs and Lac repressor constructs were integrated into the galK and ybcN regions , respectively , using recombineering ( 47 ) and combined using P1 transduction . Please refer to SI Text for details . Growth Conditions and Gene Expression Measurements .

Experimental and theoretical characterization of repressor copy number . ( A ) Immunoblots were used to measure the number of Lac re - pressors in six strains with different constitutive levels of Lac repressor . Each value corresponds to an average of cultures grown on at least 3 different days . The error bars are the SD of these measurements . ( B ) The fold - change measurements in Fig . 2 B were combined with the binding energies obtained from Fig . 2 A ( derived from strain RBS1027 ) to predict the number of Lac repressors per cell in each one of the six strains used in this work . These predictions were examined experimentally by counting the number of Lac repressors using quantitative immunoblots . −18 −16 −14 −12 −10 Strain H G 104 R B S 1147 R B S 446 R B S 1027 O e h l e r e t a l .

Determination of the in vivo binding energies . For each strain we combine the measurements of the fold change in gene expression with the corresponding number of repressors and solve Eq . 5 to obtain an estimate of the binding energies ( dots ) . The energies obtained from the Oehler et al . data ( 33 ) are also shown . The lines correspond to using all measurements of the fold change in gene expression with their corresponding repressor numbers to ﬁ t Eq . 5 to obtain the best possible estimate for the binding energies . This ﬁ t is shown in Fig . S7 B . The results of this approach are shown as horizontal lines and the shaded region captures the uncertainty .

Our protocol for measuring LacZ activity is basically a slightly modi ﬁ ed version of the one described in refs . 48 and 49 . Details are given in SI Text . Measuring in Vivo Lac Repressor Number . Cell lysates of our different strains bearing Lac repressor were obtained as described in SI Text . Calibration samples using a known concentration of puri ﬁ ed Lac repressor ( courtesy of Stephanie Johnson , California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , CA ) diluted in a lysate of HG105 strain ( strain without Lac repressor ) were used . A nitrocellulose membrane was prepared for sample loading and after - ward blocked and treated with anti - LacI primary monoclonal antibody and HRP - linked secondary antibody as discussed in SI Text . Two microliters of each sample was spotted on the membrane in a pattern similar to that of a 96 - well plate . The resulting drops had a typical size of 3 mm . All samples were loaded in triplicate with the exception of samples 1I and HG105 . Both of them were loaded on the order of 20 times on different positions of the membrane to obtain a spatial standard that would allow for corrections of nonuniformities in the light collection ( see below ) . The membrane was dried and developed with Thermo Scienti ﬁ c Super - Signal West Femto Substrate and imaged in a Bio - Rad VersaDoc 3000 system with an exposure of 5 min . A typical raw image of one of the membranes is shown in Fig . 3 A and the corresponding loading map can be seen in Fig . 3 B . Custom Matlab code was written to detect the spots and calculate their total luminescence . The luminescence coming from the HG105 blank samples was ﬁ tted to a second - degree polynomial , which was in turn subtracted from all other luminescence values . After this procedure another second - degree polynomial was ﬁ tted to the 1I samples , resulting in a typical surface such as the one shown in Fig . 3 C . Note that differences of up to 25 % could be ob - served between different positions on the membrane . This last polynomial was used to normalize the intensity of all other samples . The luminescence corresponding to the calibration samples was overlaid withtheluminescencefromthestrains . Thecalibrationsampleswere ﬁ ttedto apowerlawusingonlythecalibrationdatapointsintherangeofthesamples that were to be measured . An example of this calibration is shown in Fig . 3 C . For additional details please refer to SI Text . Finally , the amount of Lac repressor found in a spot was related to the number of Lac repressor molecules per cell by calibration of the OD readings of the original cultures to cell density as described in SI Text .
