This is called proxemics . At its simplest , people naturally correlate physical distance to social distance . We believe that people ' s expectations of proxemics can be exploited in interaction design to mediate their interactions with devices ( phones , tablets , computers , appliances , large displays ) contained within a small ubiquitous computing ecology . Just as people expect increasing engagement and intimacy as they approach others , so should they naturally expect increasing connectivity and interaction possibilities as they bring themselves and their devices in close proximity to one another . This is called Proxemic Interactions . This book concerns the design of proxemic interactions within such future proxemic - aware ecologies . It imagines a world of devices that have fine - grained knowledge of nearby people and other devices - how they move into range , their precise distance , their identity , and even their orientation - and how such knowledge can be exploited to design interaction techniques . The first part of this book concerns theory . After introducing proxemics , we operationalize proxemics for ubicomp interaction via the Proxemic Interactions framework that designers can use to mediate people ' s interactions with digital devices . The framework , in part , identifies five key dimensions of proxemic measures ( distance , orientation , movement , identity , and location ) to consider when designing proxemic - aware ubicomp systems . The second part of this book applies this theory to practice via three case studies of proxemic - aware systems that react continuously to people ' s and devices ' proxemic relationships . The case studies explore the application of proxemics in small - space ubicomp ecologies by considering first person - to - device , then device - to - device , and finally person - to - person and device - to - device proxemic relationships . We also offer a critical perspective on proxemic interactions in the form of " " dark patterns , " " where knowledge of proxemics may ( and likely will ) be easily exploited to the detriment of the user .
