Despite several studies on architectural changes in cultured cell lines 1 , 3 , no ex vivo mechanical analyses of cancer cells obtained from patients have been reported . Using atomic force microscopy , we report the stiffness of live metastatic cancer cells taken from the body ( pleural ) ﬂuids of patients with suspected lung , breast and pancreas cancer . Within the same sample , we ﬁnd that the cell stiffness of metastatic cancer cells is more than 70 % softer , with a standard deviation over ﬁve times narrower , than the benign cells that line the body cavity . Different cancer types were found to display a common stiffness . Our work shows that mechanical analysis can distinguish cancerous cells from normal ones even when they show similar shapes . These results show that nanomechanical analysis correlates well with immunohistochemical testing currently used for detecting cancer . Recent progress in the study of cancer cell motility and invasion has generated a greater understanding of the mechanical properties involved in malignant transformation . In particular , the dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton has become a speciﬁc point of interest regarding changes in cell morphology , motility , adhesion and invasion 4 , 5 . Techniques for measuring cell adhesion and motility have been established in the laboratory for in vitro analysis of cellular phenotypic events associated with tumour cells . Current cytoskeleton analysis techniques include biochemical puriﬁcations , gene expression and polymerization assays , immunoﬂuorescent labelling , and time - lapse and electron microscopies 6 , 7 . Recently , a change in the physical properties , in particular cell elasticity , of tissue cells has been recognized as an indication of disease 2 , 8 , 9 and has emerged as a marker for cellular phenotypic events associated with cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization 2 , 10 – 12 . In particular , several studies have shown a reduction in stiffness with increasing metastatic efﬁciency in human cancer cell lines using several different in vitro biomechanical assays ( see , for example , refs 13 – 15 ) . In this letter we report on the associated cell stiffness ( elasticity ) of pathologically deﬁned human metastatic cancer cells and benign reactive mesothelial cells in human body ( pleural ) ﬂuid samples ( as approved by the Institutional Review Board ; Table 1 ) using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) 16 . AFM has been used to probe a number of properties inherent to microbial cells , mammalian cells and biomolecules 10 , 13 – 15 , 17 – 22 , including analysis of cellular mechanical strain and elasticity , due to the precise application of low forces to cells with minimal disruption 18 , 19 . Although AFM has previously been used to probe cellular mechanics under physiological conditions 13 – 15 , 21 , 23 , 24 , it has not been used for cancer cell analysis in a clinical setting , which is the purpose of this letter . Analyses of body ﬂuid samples , rather than primary tumour samples , were chosen here , because tumour cells in body ﬂuid are all metastatic in nature and thus provide a clonal population of metastatic cells for analysis . Additionally , the co - existence of both benign and metastatic cells in a single specimen provides a native internal control . Body cavities , including pleural , pericardial and peritoneal cavities , are covered by serous membranes consisting of a single row of ﬂat mesothelial cells on the surface and an underlying submesothelial layer , which cover a very large surface area in close contact with every major organ of the body . Because of their continuity with the lymphatic system , these cavities are commonly the seat of metastasis . Metastatic malignant effusions constitute an unequivocal sign of widespread cancer . Current cancer cell detection relies on qualitative morphological analyses of shape change resulting from biochemical alterations , such as cytoskeletal remodelling 25 . However , morphological analysis of cells recovered from an effusion is often difﬁcult to diagnose because of the notorious reactivity of mesothelial cells in mimicking metastatic cancer cells morphologically , featuring enlarged nuclei , increased nuclear and cytoplasmic ratios , among other cytomorphological features . We measured the nanomechanical properties associated with the observed shape changes inherent to metastatic adenocarcinoma cells and benign mesothelial cells in pleural effusions obtained from body cavity ﬂuid samples collected from patients with suspected metastatic adenocarcinoma , using standard protocols ( see Methods ) . Samples were centrifuged , and cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium for 12 h , based on time - culture experiments to establish the optimum incubation time for cell - substrate adherence for mechanical analysis while minimizing artifacts resulting from in vitro culture . The 12 h incubation also allowed the differentiation of benign and malignant cells based on their ex vivo growth and morphological characteristics ( that is , ‘tumour’ cells display anchorage - independent growth patterns , such as rounding of cells , whereas ‘normal’ mesothelial cells show a large , ﬂat morphology ; Fig . 1 ) , so that AFM analysis could be performed separately on these two cell populations . These analyses were later conﬁrmed by LETTERS nature nanotechnology | VOL 2 | DECEMBER 2007 | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology 780 © 2007 Nature Publishing Group immunoﬂuorescence analysis using biomarkers speciﬁc for metastatic cancer and mesothelial cells . Immunoﬂuorescence analysis was performed independently , although on the same population of cells from the same pleural effusion sample , to conﬁrm that cells subjected to AFM analysis based on growth characteristics indeed represented either tumour or mesothelial cells . For each sample , eight probable mesothelial ( ‘normal’ ) cells and eight probable malignant ( ‘tumour’ ) cells ( except in the negative cases where only benign cells were present ) were selected from their culture dish for ex vivo AFM analysis , which was conducted in an alternate fashion to ensure similar conditions were applied for both populations , without prior knowledge of the cytomorphological analysis . Cytomorphological ( with immunohistochemical conﬁrmatory analysis ) , AFM and immunoﬂuorescence analyses were performed independently . Cytomorphological analysis was performed on its own population of cells , but the immunoﬂuorescence and AFM analyses were made on the same population of cells ; however , all of the cell populations were obtained from the same pleural effusion . Mechanical measurements were obtained at 37 8 C at a rate of 1 Hz ( see Methods ) . Force – displacement curves were recorded on each cell to determine the relative cell stiffness ( Young’s modulus , E ) of individual cells , yielding values of E for each cell type per clinical specimen ( Table 1 ) . To conﬁrm the selected cell populations actually represent tumour and mesothelial cells , immunoﬂuorescence triple labelling assays of the samples were performed ( see Methods ; Fig . 1b – d ) . Labelling for DNA / Ber - EP4 / F - actin ( Fig . 1c ) and DNA / Ber - EP4 / Calretinin ( Fig . 1d ) both showed staining of the small , round cells for Ber - EP4 ( red ) , a marker for metastatic adenocarcinoma cells , thus conﬁrming that the round , balled cells ( shown optically in Fig . 1a ) were indeed metastatic adenocarcinoma cells . Moreover , the large , ﬂat cells were positive for Calretinin staining ( Fig . 1d ) , indicative of normal mesothelial cells and consistent with the optical morphology ( Fig . 1a ) . Immunoﬂuorescence analysis showed that the small round cells were not apoptotic , dead or mitotic , as they have intact DNA ( Fig . 1b – d , blue ﬂuorescence ) . Cell elasticity measurements ( Young’s modulus , E ) taken on cytological samples collected from patients with suspected metastatic adenocarcinoma are shown in Fig . 2 . Data collected from seven different clinical samples ( positive for metastatic tumour , n ¼ 40 ; negative for metastatic tumour , n ¼ 48 ) yielded average E values ( mean + s . d . ) for all tumour and benign mesothelial cells of 0 . 53 + 0 . 10 kPa and 1 . 97 + 0 . 70 kPa , respectively ( Fig . 2b , c ; P ¼ 8 . 72 (cid:2) 10 2 22 ) . A two - sample independent t - test conducted on the tumour and mesothelial cell populations showed that the population means were signiﬁcantly different from each other at the 95 % conﬁdence level ( P ¼ 8 . 72 (cid:2) 10 2 22 ) . In particular , tumour cell elasticity measurements from a single clinical sample were found to have an average cell stiffness ( mean + s . d . ) of 0 . 56 + 0 . 09 kPa ( Fig . 2e ) ; however , the average cell stiffness for the morphologically determined benign mesothelial cells in the sample expressed a signiﬁcantly increased average cellular elasticity ( mean + s . d . ) , with a value of 2 . 10 + 0 . 79 kPa ( Fig . 2f ; P ¼ 7 . 77 (cid:2) 10 2 5 ) . Interestingly , the tumour and benign mesothelial cells exhibited signiﬁcantly different trends ; elasticity measurements for the metastatic cancer cells and the benign mesothelial cells were best ﬁt by gaussian ( normal ) and log - normal ﬁts , respectively . Tumour cells displayed a narrow , spiked peak with little spread , whereas benign mesothelial cells displayed a broad peak . Similarly , elasticity measurements collected on a single negative pleural ﬂuid sample yielded an average cell stiffness ( mean + s . d . ) of 2 . 09 + 0 . 98 kPa ( Fig . 2g ; n ¼ 8 ) . The data clearly show that the cell stiffness of metastatic cancer cells is (cid:3) 73 + 11 % less stiff than the benign mesothelial cells in the same sample and when compared to samples collected from other patients . Figure 2h , i shows gaussian ﬁts of Young’s modulus data collected on an individual clinical sample ( Table 1 , Case 4 ) containing only one population of cells , which were difﬁcult to determine as either benign mesothelial cells or metastatic malignant cells , based on cytomorphology .

LETTERS nature nanotechnology | VOL 2 | DECEMBER 2007 | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology 781 © 2007 Nature Publishing Group ex vivo culture there still appeared to be two populations of cells , one cell type that was larger and more ﬂat , suggestive of benign mesothelial cells , and the other type , which was more round and balled up , suggestive of tumour cells . Despite the difference of morphology in ex vivo culture , nanomechanical analysis concluded that these were all tumour cells . Average values ( mean + s . d . ) for both the tumour and morphologically classiﬁed benign mesothelial cells were 0 . 54 + 0 . 08 kPa and 0 . 54 + 0 . 12 kPa , respectively ( Fig . 2 h , i ; n ¼ 8 ) . These population means were not statistically different , and indicated the presence of a single population of malignant cells . Subsequent immunohistochemical staining ( IHC ) with a battery of markers including Calretinin , B72 . 3 and Ber - EP4 ( see Supplementary Information ) conﬁrmed that the sample contained predominantly one cell population , which was indeed malignant based on IHC ﬁndings ( negative for Calretinin and positive for Ber - EP4 and B72 . 3 ) . Additionally , this particular case demonstrates no correlation between ex vivo cultured cell morphology and expected measured stiffness . This lack of correlation suggests that it is unlikely that the ex vivo cultured morphological differences inﬂuence measured elasticity . For each individual patient effusion a new cantilever was used , to avoid any contribution of possible artifacts . The similarity in the data from patient to patient and cell to cell is strongly suggestive of a parallel between patient effusions and cell type . To further conﬁrm that the measured differences between tumour and benign cells were not an artifact of ex vitro culturing , we used a modiﬁed cytocentrifugation procedure without ex vivo culturing , which yielded morphologically indistinguishable cell types . The resulting Young’s modulus values for tumour and benign mesothelial cells were analogous to those obtained using the 12 h ex vivo culture method ( see Supplementary Information for more details ) . This correlation of cell stiffness for the tumour and normal cells in the pleural effusions experimentally demonstrates that the mechanical analysis is representative of cell type , even when considering different preparation methods and the use of different substrates . The need for biomarkers for cancer detection and analysis is critical due to the complexity of the disease . This study shows important implications for the combined use of imaging analysis with nanomechanical measurements as a novel biomarker for evaluating and sensing changes in tumour cells , and which is easily translated into clinical settings . Our results suggest that a shift in biologically driven biomechanical properties towards a decrease in cell stiffness correlates with an increase in metastatic potential . Under analogous conditions , cell stiffness of metastatic cancer cells is . 70 % lower than normal reactive mesothelial cells in the same sample , when compared to other pleural effusions , or even for patients with different clinical histories ( Table 1 ) . This ﬁnding is consistent with previous studies , which found a decrease in stiffness of human cancer cell lines with increasing metastatic efﬁciency using different single - cell in vitro biomechanical assays 13 – 15 .

These ﬁndings clearly demonstrate the ability of nanomechanical - based functional analysis to detect metastatic tumour cells in body ﬂuid . Likewise , the distribution of measured cell stiffness for tumour cells is over ﬁve times narrower than the corresponding distribution for benign mesothelial cells . We found that tumour cell stiffness ﬁts with a normal distribution , whereas the measured benign mesothelial cell stiffness values better ﬁt a log - normal distribution . The ﬁnding that no quantitative overlap was observed in the measured cell elasticity values collected for the metastatic tumour and reactive mesothelial cells is of major diagnostic signiﬁcance . Cancer is extremely biochemically diverse , yet mechanically a common modulus for each cell type is exhibited even for different tumour types and patient effusions ( Table 1 ) . The correlation of cytomechanical measurements with immunohistochemical analysis suggests that nanomechanical measurements of cancer cells has potential for the detection of cancer and may aid in personalized selection of medication and drug screening , especially in body cavity effusions where accurate diagnosis based solely on morphology has to date been challenging . METHODS CYTOLOGICAL SAMPLE COLLECTION The body cavity ﬂuid samples were collected and processed using a standard protocol in cytology labs for conventional cytological analysis including Papanicolaou stain , Gimsa stain and cellblock preparation . An aliquot of the remaining sample ( 10 ml ) was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min . Cell pellets were resuspended with MEM - F12 culture medium and incubated for 12 h at 37 8 C in 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air . The culture medium was changed immediately before AFM analysis to wash off any dead and untouched cells . NANOMECHANICAL MEASUREMENTS WITH AFM All studies were conducted using a Nanoscope IV Bioscope ( Veeco Digital Instruments ) with a combined inverted optical microscope ( Nikon eclipse TE200 ) . This combination permitted lateral positioning of the AFM tip over the nuclear region of the cell with micrometre precision ( Fig . 1a , inset ) . The scan size for all measurements was set to 0 nm to maintain a constant position over the cell , and using the AFM software the tip was brought into contact with the central region of the cell 26 . Mechanical measurements were collected at 37 8 C using sharpened silicon nitride cantilevers with experimentally determined 27 spring constants of 0 . 02 N m 2 1 and a tip radius of , 20 nm . Force – displacement curves were recorded at 1 Hz for determination of Young’s modulus E . E was calculated by converting the force curves into force – indentation curves 28 and ﬁtting with the Hertz model , which describes the indentation of an elastic sample using a stiff conical indenter , as described elsewhere 10 , 29 . The half opening angle of the AFM tip was 36 8 and the Poisson ratio of the cell was taken to be 0 . 5 , as is typical for soft biological materials 28 . To prevent damage to the cell surface and to reduce any possible substrate - induced effects , measurements were analysed in force ranges resulting in shallow indentations of the cell ( , 400 nm ) 30 . IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE TRIPLE LABELLING Two types of triple labelling assays were performed , one was DNA / F - actin / Ber - EP4 and the other DNA / Calretinin / Ber - EP4 . For both experiments , cells were ﬁxed ﬁrst with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with 1 (cid:2) PBS three times , then incubated with 1 % BSA in PBS pH 7 . 4 for 30 min . For DNA / F - actin / Ber - EP4 labelling , cells were ﬁrst incubated with mouse anti - human Ber - EP4 ( DAKO ) at 1 : 300 dilution for 1 h , followed by Cy3 - conjugated AfﬁniPure goat anti - mouse IgG ( H þ L ) ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab ) at 1 : 200 dilution for 30 min , then with BODIPY FL phallacidin F - actin ( Molecular Probes ) at 1 : 40 dilution for 30 min . Finally , cells were incubated with 1 : 10 , 000 DAPI for 5 min . For DNA / Calretinin / Ber - EP4 labelling , cells were ﬁrst incubated with mouse anti - human Ber - EP4 ( DAKO ) at 1 : 300 dilution for 1 h , followed by Cy3 - conjugated AfﬁniPure goat anti - mouse IgG ( H þ L ) ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab ) at 1 : 200 dilution for 30 min . Cells were then further incubated with 1 : 600 diluted rabbit anti - human Calretinin antibody ( Zymed ) for 1 h thenwith FITC - conjugated AfﬁniPure goat anti - rabbit IgG ( H þ L ) ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab ) at 1 : 50 dilution for 30 min , followed by 1 : 10 , 000 DAPI for 5 min . All incubations were performed at room temperature and there were three PBS washing steps in between . Cells were covered with mounting medium for ﬂuorescence microscopic examination . Images were taken using an Olympus BX - 40 microscope with a (cid:2) 40 objective . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Datawere expressed as mean + s . d . , and the statistical signiﬁcance of differences in mean values was assessed using a two - sample independent Student’s t - test at the 95 % conﬁdence level . Differences among means are reported using exact P values . Received 9 September 2007 ; accepted 19 October 2007 ; published 2 December 2007 . References 1 . Bhadriraju , K . & Hansen , L . K .
