Mis - Assembly of Clathrin Lattices on Endosomes Reveals a Regulatory Switch for Coated Pit Formation Li - Hsien Wang , Karen G . Rothberg , and Richard G . W . Anderson Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , Texas 75235 Abstract . The clathrin - coated pit lattice is held onto the plasma membrane by an integral membrane pro - tein that binds the clathrin AP - 2 subunit with high affinity . In vitro studies have suggested that this pro - tein controls the assembly of the pit because mem - brane bound Apo2 is required for lattice assembly . If so , the AP - 2 binding site must be a resident protein of the coated pit and recycle with other receptors that en - ter cells through this pathway . Proper recycling , how - ever , would require the switching off of AP - 2 binding to allow the binding site to travel through the endo - cytic pathway unencumbered . Evidence for this hy - pothesis has been revealed by the cationic amphiphilic class of drugs ( CAD ) , which have previously been found to inhibit receptor recycling . Incubation of hu - man fibroblasts in the presence of these drugs caused clathrin lattices to assemble on endosomal membranes and at the same time prevented coated pit assembly at the cell surface . These effects suggest that CADs re - verse an on / off switch that controls AP - 2 binding to membranes . We conclude that cells have a mechanism for switching on and off AP - 2 binding during the en - docytic cycle . ECEPTOR - MEDIATED - endocytosis is a constitutive en - docytic process that uses clathrin - coated pits as the vehicle for internalization . The membrane coat is a polygonal lattice composed of clathrin triskelion and AP - 2 subunits ( 21 ) . AP - 2 holds the clathrin lattice on the mem - brane by forming a linkage between each triskelion and a high affinity binding site integral to the plasma membrane ( 24 , 30 ) . AP - 2 may also modulate receptor clustering within the assembled pit ( 29 ) . Receptors that are capable of cluster - ing contain a characteristic / S - turn motif in the cytoplasmic tail ( 4 , 11 ) . The steady state number of coated pits on the surface of each cell type is usually constant ( 2 ) . The fusion of secretory vesicles during exocytosis , however , can stimulate the for - mation of additional coated pits that retrieve excess mem - brane . For example , the fertilization of a sea urchin egg causes cortical granules to fuse with the plasma membrane , and this is immediately followed by a massive recruitment of clathrin - coated pits to the membrane ( 12 ) . Likewise , nerve terminal - derived - coated vesicles contain almost ex - clusively membrane that was inserted during synaptic vesicle exocytosis ( 25 ) . These observations raise questions about how the assembly of the pit is regulated and whether or not these regulatory mechanisms operate during each endocytic cycle . Receptor - mediated - endocytosis can proceed for many Please address all correspondence to Dr . Richard G . W .

There are three populations of vesicles that recep - tors may encounter as they recycle ( 13 , 28 ) : early endo - somes , late endosomes , and recycling vesicles . Clathrin and AP - 2 , by contrast , appear to dissociate from the membrane shortly after the formation of endosomes and remain soluble in the cytoplasm until used to assemble another coated pit ( 15 , 31 ) . The high affinity AP - 2 binding site responsible for holding the clathrin lattice on the membrane appears to be an integral membrane protein ( s ) . Most likely it is internalized and recy - cled during endocytosis along with membrane proteins like the LDL receptor that reside in coated pits ( 8 ) . This would require that AP - 2 binding activity be turned off after inter - nalization to prevent subunit binding and subsequent assem - bly of coated pits on endosomal membranes . So far , the only marker for the AP - 2 binding site is the presence of the clathrin lattice . Reagents that inhibit receptor recycling have been useful for identifying different stages in endocytosis ( 8 ) . The most thoroughly studied group of inhibitors are those that elevate the pH of acidic compartments . They interfere with receptor recycling by inhibiting the dissociation of ligand from recep - tor , which leads to trapping of the receptor in endosomes ( 5 ) . A less well understood group of inhibitors are the cat - ionic amphiphilic drugs ( 9 , 19 ) . This class of drugs prevents recycling of receptors for transferrin ( 19 ) , epidermal growth factor , and OtE - macroglobulin ( 9 ) . The mechanism of inhibi - tion is not known but probably does not involve the disrup - tion of pH gradients in endosomes ( 9 , 19 ) . © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 93 / 12 / 1107 / 11 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 123 , Number 5 , December 1993 1107 - 1117 1107 Materials and Methods 200 - Materials The following reagents were obtained from Sigma Chem .

Results Chlorpromazine Inhibits LDL Receptor Recycling LDL receptors become trapped in endosomes when cells are incubated in the presence of monensin ( 5 ) . To see if cationic amphiphilic drugs also affect LDL receptor recycling , we in - cubated cells at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of different concentrations of chlorpromazine , and then assayed for ~ 25I - LDL surface binding at 4°C ( Fig . 1 , o ) . We observed a progressive decline in the number of receptors on the cell surface as the drug concentration was increased . Only , , ol 3 % of the receptors remained after incubation in 100 / ~ M chlorpromazine . By contrast , 25 ttM monensin reduced sur - face receptors by < 50 % during the same incubation period ( Fig . 1 , • on the ordinate ) . Almost immediately after we exposed the cells to 50 / xM chlorpromazine , the receptors began to disappear from the surface ( Fig . 2 , o ) . Maximum loss occurred after 30 rain of incubation . Receptors rapidly reappeared on the cell surface when we removed the drug ( wash , Fig . 2 ) . Eighty - three per - cent of the original number of receptors were on the cell sur - face after a 30 - min incubation at 37°C in the absence of the drug . We used indirect immunofluorescence to determine the fate of receptors during drug treatment ( Fig . 3 ) . Cells were incubated in the presence ( Fig . 3 , B and D ) or absence ( Fig . 3 , A and C ) of the drug at 37°C for various times and assayed for the presence of either surface ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) or internal ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) LDL receptors by indirect immunofluores - cence . Initially most of the receptors were on the cell sur - face , arranged in a typical punctate pattern ( Fig . 3 A ) . Thirty minutes of incubation in the presence of chlorpromazine caused receptors to leave the cell surface ( compare Fig . 3 A with 3 B ) and become located in small vesicles in the cytoplasm ( compare Fig . 3 C with Fig . 3 D ) . We also noted that the amount of anti - receptor IgG binding to the Golgi area of the cell tended to increase ( Fig . 3 D ) . After we re - moved the drug , most of the cells regained a normal surface staining pattern ( data not shown ) . Figure 5 .

Mis - Assembly of Pits 1111 Chlorpromazine Causes Coated Pits to Assemble on Endosomes Monensin inhibits receptor recycling by trapping receptors in endosomes but it does not affect the distribution of clathrin - coated pits ( 5 ) . This was not the case for cldor - promazine . When we treated cells with this drug for 30 min at 37°C , fixed , and then stained with anti - clathrin IgG ( Fig . 4 ) , the clathrin was no longer present on the cell surface in coated pits ( compare Fig . 4 A with B ) . Instead , staining was associated with numerous vesicles deep within the cyto - plasm of the cell . Often the staining was organized into quad - rants at the periphery of each vesicle , suggesting that clathrin was only partially coating the membrane . The exact same staining pattern was seen when we replaced the anti - clathrin IgG with an IgG specific for AP - 2 ( compare Fig . 4 C with 4D ) . Immunofluorescence shows that anti - AP - 2 IgG stains al - most exclusively coated pits in human fibroblasts ( Fig . 4 C ) , which indicates that this subunit is not normally present on early endosomes and must dissociate soon after coated vesi - cles form . To determine if chlorpromazine prevented the un - coating of the clathrin coat after vesicle formation , we used immunofluorescence to follow the distribution of AP - 2 in cells that were incubated in the presence of chlorpromazine for various times at 37°C ( Fig . 5 ) . The earliest change ob - served ( 5 - 10 min of incubation ) was the disappearance of AP - 2 from the cell surface ( compare Fig . 5 A with 5 B ) and a concomitant increase in diffuse as well as particulate fluorescence in the cytoplasm of the cell . This was followed by the appearance of distinct vesicle staining after 15 - 30 min of incubation ( Fig . 5 C ) . These results suggested that chlorpromazine was not preventing the uncoating of coated vesicles . This was confirmed when we incubated cells in the presence of the drug at 180C for 30 min ( Fig . 6 ) and found that rather than being bound to a membrane , AP - 2 was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of the cell ( Fig . 6 , compare B with A ) . If we maintained a set of these cells in the drug while shifting the temperature to 37°C , the diffuse AP - 2 staining promptly changed to the vesicle staining pattern ( Fig . 6 , compare C with B ) . The same result was obtained with anti - clathrin IgG ( data not shown ) . Therefore , the loss of clathrin / AP - 2 from the plasma membrane and appearance on vesicles appear to be separate events . The effect of chlorprornazine on the distribution of clathrin / AP - 2 was reversible ( Fig . 7 ) . Cells incubated in the presence of chlorpromazine for 30 min at 370C displayed AP - 2 on vesicles instead of coated pits ( Fig . 7 , compare A with B ) . When we washed away the drug , a normal coated pit staining pattern was observed after just 30 rain of incuba - tion ( Fig . 7 , compare B with C ) . Figure 6 .

Either ceils were not treated ( A ) or were incubated in the presence of 100 # M chlorpromazine for 30 min at 18°C ( B and C ) . One set of these cells was maintained at 18°C ( B ) while the other ( C ) was shifted to 37°C before both were in - cubated in the presence of chlorpromazine an additional 30 min . The cells were all fixed , permeabilized , and processed for indirect immunofluorescence localization of AP - 2 . Bar , 15 ~ , m . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 123 , 1993 1112 Table I .

At the end of the incubation , the ceils were processed for immunofluorescence as described . Each sample was scored for either coated pit staining ( Fig . 4 A ) or vesicle staining ( Fig . 4 B ) as shown in Fig . 4 . To better define the mechanism of action of chlorproma - zine , we assayed a number of other drugs for their effects on clathrin / AP - 2 distribution ( Table I ) . All of the phenothia - zincs , as well as sphingosine , caused clathrin / AP - 2 redistri - bution . Compounds that elevate the pH of intracellular com - partments ( e . g . , monensin ) had no effect . Drugs that tend to inhibit calmodulin - dependent functions ( e . g . , W - 7 ) caused mis - assembly while those that specifically inhibit protein ki - nase C ( e . g . , Calphostin C ) did not affect AP - 2 distribution . One exception was calmidazolium , which had no effect even though it specifically inhibits calmodulin dependent func - tions ( 7 , 16 ) . The vesicle population decorated with clathrin / AP - 2 was identified by electron microscopy ( Fig . 8 ) . We first incubated fibroblasts in the presence of chlorpromazine for 30 min , and then disrupted the cells and applied anti - AP - 2 IgG followed by immunogold . Like normal cells , chlorpromazine treated cells had numerous multivesicular bodies ( late endosomes ) . A portion of the outer membrane of many of these vesicles was decorated with a fuzzy coat that had the characteristic appearance of a clathrin lattice ( arrows , Fig . 8 , A - C , E ) . Some vesicles had more than one coated region ( arrow , Fig . 8 E ) . Usually the coat was much larger than the typical size of a surface coated pit ( Fig . 8 , A - C , E ) . Each coat was also positively stained with anti - AP - 2 IgG specific immunogold ( arrows , Fig , 8 , A , ( 7 , and E ) but not nonimmune IgG ( Fig . 8 B ) . We did not see any other membrane compartments that were labeled with either anti - AP - 2 IgG gold or fuzzy coats . In addition , fuzzy coats were never seen on endosomal struc - tures of untreated cells ( Fig . 8 D ) . Figure 7 . Chlorprornazine induced relocation of AP - 2 is reversible .

Mis - Assembly of Pits 1113 LDL Receptor and AP - 2 Are Associated with Different Vesicles Chlorpromazine could inhibit LDL receptor recycling be - cause the receptor becomes entangled in endosomal coated pits . Therefore , we used indirect immunofluorescence to colocalize receptors and AP - 2 at various times after treat - ment with chlorpromazine ( Fig . 9 ) . The two markers were initially together in coated pits at the cell surface ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) . Cells incubated for 10 min in the presence of chlor - promazine had LDL receptors in small vesicles that were de - void of anti - AP - 2 IgG staining ( Fig . 9 , compare C with D ) . After 30 rain of incubation , prominent endosomal staining of AP - 2 was observed , but none of these structures were positive for anti - LDL receptor staining ( Fig . 9 , compare E with F ) . Therefore , AP - 2 binding sites and LDL receptors are trapped in different compartments in response to chlor - promazine . Discussion Chlorpromazine causes the loss of coated pits from the sur - face of the cell and the appearance of clathrin coats com - posed of the same subunits on endosomal membranes . Chlorpromazine has revealed a previously unrecognized regulatory step in receptor - mediated - endocytosis : the mem - brane binding of AP - 2 and the subsequent formation of clathrin lattices . A likely site of regulation is the binding of AP - 2 to its high affinity binding site . These results are in agreement with the recent studies of Seaman et al . ( 33 ) who found that AP - 2 binding to membranes and coated pit assem - bly can be modulated in broken cell preparations by either calcium or GTP ' rS . AP - 2 Receptor Virshup and Bennett ( 36 ) were the first to show that mem - branes from both coated vesicles and whole brains could bind isolated APs . AP - binding activity was further defined by Mahaffey et ai . ( 24 ) who discovered a membrane pro - tein ( s ) within coated pits that binds AP - 2 with high affinity . The AP - 2 subunit consists of two distinct domains , referred to as the core and the appendage ( 18 , 22 ) , that can be sepa - rated after proteolysis . Only the core domain binds to the AP - 2 binding site ( 30 ) . In addition , this is the domain that binds clathrin during lattice assembly ( 30 ) . Treatment of membranes with proteases removes the binding site ( 30 ) , which prevents AP - 2 binding and lattice assembly . These data suggest that active AP - 2 binding sites are the controlling element for clathrin lattice assembly . These sites appear to be integral membrane proteins and most likely recycle because other plasma membrane proteins that enter cells through coated pits recycle ( 8 ) . To avoid making coated pits in recycling compartments , the AP - 2 binding site must be switched off shortly after coated vesicle formation . It must then be switched back on upon returning to the cell sur - face . Chlorpromazine appears to be affecting the switching mechanism . Cells incubated in the presence of chlorpromazine at 18°C lost surface clathrin / AP - 2 but after the temperature was shifted to 37°C the subunits appeared on endosomes . Other workers have shown that endosomal fusion is retarded at 18°C while ligand internalization , receptor recycling , and coated vesicle uncoating are unaffected ( 10 , 17 ) . Perhaps the initial loss of clathrin / AP - 2 in the above experiment is a con - sequence of the normal uncoating process while the chlor - promazine inactivated all of the AP - 2 binding sites . When the temperature was shifted to 37°C in the presence of the drug , only the endosomal binding sites were activated . This is consistent with in vitro experiments showing that either Ca + + or GTP ~ S can switch lattice assembly from the plasma membrane to endosomes ( 33 ) . The LDL receptor and clathrin / AP - 2 did not colocalize af - ter ceils were incubated in the presence of chlorpromazine . Therefore , the AP - 2 binding site and the LDL receptor be - come trapped in different vesicle populations of the endo - cytic pathway . This implies that the cytoplasmic tail of recep - tors like the LDL receptor are not the high affinity AP - 2 binding site . On the other hand , transfected cells that over express transferrin receptors appear to have an increased number of clathrin lattices ( 20 , 26 ) , which suggests that receptor tails can influence pit assembly . We conclude that chlorpromazine activates a population of recycling AP - 2 binding sites that normally are inactive . The natural cationic amphiphilic molecule sphingosine also causes anomalous binding of clathrin / AP - 2 on endosomes when added exogenously to cells ( Table I ) . Endogenous sphingosine - l - phosphate appears to regulate cell motility , tu - mor cell invasiveness , and cell proliferation ( 23 , 32 ) . Recent experiments with clathrin deficient Dictyostelium have sug - gested that clathrin - coated pits are important for proper chemotactic motility ( 27 ) . These observations raise the pos - sibility that endogenous CADs might control the direction of cell movement by regulating coated pit assembly . Mechanism of Action of CAD CADs affect the activity of many different enzymes . For ex - ample , they inhibit phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase , CTP : phosphocholine cytidyltransferase , protein kinase C , Ca + + / calmodulin - dependent enzymes , Na + , K + - ATPase , but activate phospholipase D ( 23 ) . Protein kinase C ( 3 ) and calmodulin ( 16 ) have both been found to affect receptor traffic during receptor - mediated - endocytosis . PMA , an activator of protein kinase C , stimulates the hyperpbosphorylation and the internalization of transferrin receptors ( for review see 34 ) . Trifluoperazine , a CAD that causes clathrirdAP - 2 assembly on endosomes ( Table I ) , has the same effect as PMA ( 19 ) . In contrast to these results , we found that PMA had no effect on clathrin / AP - 2 distribution ( Table I ) . Even pretreatment of cells with PMA before chlor - promazine did not prevent the relocation of clathrin / AP - 2 to endosomes . Calphostin C , a potent inhibitor of protein ki - nase C , also did not affect clathrin distribution ( Table D - These results suggest that protein kinase C is not involved in regulating pit assembly . Inhibitors of calmodulin function also impair transferrin receptor recycling ( 16 ) . We had less success obtaining direct information on the role of calmodulin in clathrin / AP - 2 relo - cation . Two specific inhihitors of Ca + + / calmodulin - depen - dent enzymes that were tested are W - 7 and calmidazolium . The former caused clathrin / AP - 2 relocation to endosomes while the latter had no effect ( Table I ) . The recent finding by Seaman et al . ( 33 ) that high Ca + + can cause the mis - assembly of coated pits on endosomal membranes in vitro The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 123 , 1993 1114 Figure 8 . Chlorpromazine causes clathrin and AP - 2 to relocate to multivesicular bodies . Normal human fibroblasts were incubated in the presence ( A - C , E ) or the absence ( D ) of chlorpromazine for 30 rain at 37°C . At the end of the incubation , cells were processed for immunogold localization of either anti - AP - 2 IgG binding sites ( A , C , and E ) or nonimmune IgG binding sites ( B and D ) as de - scribed . Untreated cells were processed for electron microscopy only . Bar , 0 . 21 / ~ m . Wang et al . Mis - Assembly of Pits 1115 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 123 , 1993 1116 suggests that a Ca + + regulated step might be involved in AP - 2 binding . Control of Endocytosis Chlorpromazine has revealed a regulatory site for control - ling coated pit assembly . The effects of the drug indicate that normally the activation of pit assembly at the cell surface is somehow synchronized with the inactivation of pit assembly on newly formed endosomes . This suggests the existence of a molecular switch , possibly one that is controlled by cal - cium or GTP ( 33 ) , that turns on and off AP - 2 binding to its binding site . This switch may play an important role in regulating coated pit formation in instances where massive recruitment of membrane to the cell surface occurs during exocytosis . We would like to thank Mr . William Donzell and Dr . Ravindra Pathak for their assistance in preparing the photographs . We are also grateful for the assistance of Edith Wolrnack who prepared the fibroblast cultures . This study would not have been possible without the generous supply of mono - clonal antibodies X - 22 and AP - 6 provided by Dr . Frances Brodsky .
