Parton 4 , 11 and Ludger Johannes 1 , 2 , 3 , 10 , 11 Several cell surface molecules including signalling receptors are internalized by clathrin - independent endocytosis . How this process is initiated , how cargo proteins are sorted and membranes are bent remains unknown . Here , we found that a carbohydrate - binding protein , galectin - 3 ( Gal3 ) , triggered the glycosphingolipid ( GSL ) - dependent biogenesis of a morphologically distinct class of endocytic structures , termed clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) . Super - resolution and reconstitution studies showed that Gal3 required GSLs for clustering and membrane bending . Gal3 interacted with a deﬁned set of cargo proteins . Cellular uptake of the CLIC cargo CD44 was dependent on Gal3 , GSLs and branched N - glycosylation . Endocytosis of β 1 - integrin was also reliant on Gal3 . Analysis of different galectins revealed a distinct proﬁle of cargoes and uptake structures , suggesting the existence of different CLIC populations . We conclude that Gal3 functionally integrates carbohydrate speciﬁcity on cargo proteins with the capacity of GSLs to drive clathrin - independent plasma membrane bending as a ﬁrst step of CLIC biogenesis . The endocytic pathway consists of distinct vesicular compartments , which merge in the early endosome . Mechanistically , endocytic events can be subdivided into clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent processes 1 – 6 . Cargoes that are eﬃciently internalized in the absence of clathrin include endogenous surface molecules such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins 7 , CD44 ( refs 8 , 9 ) , major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules 10 , interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) receptor 11 , and exogenous ligands such as the bacterial Shiga 12 and cholera toxins 13 , 14 and simian virus 40 ( ref . 15 ) . A large fraction of fluid phase is also internalized by clathrin - independent endocytosis ( reviewed in refs 2 , 4 ) . CD44 , cholera toxin and fluid - phase markers were mapped to early internalization structures with a distinct morphology , termed clathrin - independent carriers 14 ( CLICs ) . CLICs arise directly from the plasma membrane , mature into the GPI - enriched early endosomal compartments 7 , and subsequently merge with early endosomes . Highly organized electron dense coat structures could not be detected at sites of membrane invagination in clathrin ( and caveolin ) - independent uptake processes . How cargo proteins are sorted and membranes are bent to build endocytic pits in these cases has therefore been one of the challenging questions in the field of endocytosis . In mammals , the 15 members of the galectin family of N - glycan - binding proteins have functions in cancer , immunity , inflammation and development 16 – 19 . Within this family , galectin - 3 ( Gal3 ) is unique in that it combines a carbohydrate recognition domain in its carboxy terminus with an amino - terminal non - lectin domain that favours the formation of Gal3 oligomers including pentamers 20 , 21 . Branched N - acetylglucosamine saccharides that result from the activity of the Golgi - localized β - 1 , 6 - N - acetylglycosaminyltransferase V ( Mgat5 ) are preferred binding determinants for Gal3 in the formation of an extracellular galectin – glycoprotein lattice , which regulates receptor tyrosine kinase signalling , cell migration and fibronectin fibril formation 22 , 23 . The availability of Gal3 in tissues is controlled through expressionandatypicalsecretion ( reviewedinref . 24 ) . Gal3expression is deregulated in human cancers , and it has been suggested that Gal3 couldbeatumourmarker 25 , 26 . BindingtoGSLshasbeendemonstrated for galectin - 4 ( Gal4 ; ref . 27 ) and galectin - 9 ( ref . 28 ) , and suggested for Gal3 ( refs 29 , 30 ) . The biological functions of these GSL interactions have remained elusive . GSLs are present in all mammalian cell types , throughout the animal kingdom , in bacteria , fungi and plants .

Based on electron microscopy analysis , three classes of uptake structures could be distinguished in control cells 8 : 40 – 60nm and 80 – 120nm vesicles corresponding to caveolar or clathrin - mediated endocyto - sis , respectively ( Fig . 1a , arrowheads ) and tubular and ring - shaped CLIC structures ( Fig . 1a , arrows ) . When GSLs were depleted us - ing an inhibitor of glycosylceramide synthase ( D , L - threo - 1 - phenyl - 2 - palmitoylamino - 3 - morpholino - 1 - propanol , PPMP ) , only the occur - rence of tubular and ring - shaped CLIC structures was significantly reduced ( Fig . 1a , b ) , strongly suggesting that CLIC processes were exquisitely sensitive to GSL levels . Consistent with this , the uptake of the CLIC cargo protein CD44 ( ref . 8 ) was almost completely abol - ished in GSL - depleted cells , whereas transferrin ( Tf ) uptake through the clathrin pathway was not aﬀected ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 1a , e ) . To rule out potential oﬀ - target eﬀects of pharmacological GSLdepletion , werepeatedtheseexperimentsonGSL - deficientGM95 cells 35 . CD44 uptake was also strongly diminished on these cells , when compared with parental GSL - containing MEB4 cells ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 1b , e ) . Stable overexpression of the ceramide glucosyltransferase - 1 gene ( CG1 cells ) in GM95 cells partially rescued the CD44 uptake phenotype . CD44 surface levels were not altered in these diﬀerent conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 1c , d ) , most likely because CD44 is predominately localized at the plasma membrane at steady state . Thus , uptake inhibition under conditions of pharmaco - logically or genetically induced GSL deficiency clearly pointed to a functional role for GSLs in CD44 internalization and CLIC biogenesis . To establish a molecular link between GSLs and CLICs , we searched the CLIC proteomics list 8 for proteins with a clearly established capacity to bind carbohydrates . Gal3 was one of the best candidates 24 . We expressed recombinant Gal3 , which for some experiments was tagged with HRP or fluorophores . In MEFs ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Video 1 ) or mouse mammary tumour epithelial cells ( TECs ; Supplementary Video 2 ) , HRP - coupled Gal3 decorated small crescent - shaped cisternae with invaginations , exhibiting the characteristic hallmarks of CLIC morphology 14 . These structures were formed with as little as 10ngml − 1 of Gal3 – HRP ( Supplementary Fig . 1f ) , a concentration that is within the range of Gal3 levels in human serum 36 , 37 . Depletion of GSLs caused a pronounced loss of these Gal3 - CLIC structures ( Fig . 1f and Supplementary Fig . 1g ) . Taken together , the data established a link between GSL expression , Gal3 endocytosis and CLIC formation . To address the contribution of GSLs to Gal3 organization before uptake , we determined Gal3 distribution at the plasma membrane by dSTORM super - resolution localization microscopy . PPMP treatment revealed that Gal3 clustering at the cell surface was GSL dependent ( Fig . 1g , handSupplementaryFig . 2a – kandNote1 ) . Gal3clusterswere 75 ± 2nm in diameter , and became smaller and more abundant in GSL - depleted cells . Apart from being clathrin independent , CLIC processes are also little reliant on the scission GTPase dynamin , but strongly sensitive to actin perturbation 14 . We found here that Gal3 uptake was largely unaﬀected by inhibition of clathrin and dynamin activities , both 594 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 16 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2014 © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . A RT I C L E S in TECs and HeLa cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3a – d ) . The genesis of Gal3 - CLICs in MEFs was also not altered under these perturbation conditions ( Fig . 2a ) . In contrast , a marked reduction of Gal3 uptake ( Fig . 2b , c ) and Gal3 - CLIC formation ( Fig . 2a ) was observed when actin polymerization was inhibited with latrunculin A . These findings further confirmed that Gal3 was internalized in a clathrin - independent manner through CLICs . In conclusion , Gal3 clustering , CD44 uptake and Gal3 - CLIC formation required GSL expression . Gal3 needs glycosylated proteins for binding to cells Gal3 binding to TECs was not aﬀected by GSL depletion ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , suggesting that proteins were the primary binding determinants . Indeed , removal of the extracellular domains of glycosylated and non - glycosylated plasma membrane proteins with proteinase K resulted in strongly decreased Gal3 binding , whereas binding of the B - subunit of cholera toxin ( CTxB ) to the GSL GM1 was not aﬀected ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . A similar conclusion was reached when TECs were treated with tunicamycin or 1 - deoxymannojirimycin to inhibit protein N - glycosylation . Again , Gal3 binding to the surface of cells was strongly reduced , whereas binding of CTxB to its lipid receptor GM1 was not aﬀected ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Thus , N - glycosylated proteins were required for Gal3 recruitment to the plasma membrane . Gal3 interacting proteins at the cell surface were identified by Gal3 pulldown followed by mass spectrometry . The list of Gal3 binders contained mostly proteins from plasma membrane , extracellular space or intracellular compartments ( cytosol , lysosomes , Golgi apparatus ) that communicate with the plasma membrane ( Supplementary Fig . 4d and Table 1 ) , and included several known Gal3 interactors ( Fig . 3a , red bars ) . Strikingly , putative and established CLIC cargoes , including CD44 , were also found on the list of Gal3 binders ( Fig . 3a , asterisks ) . The interaction between Gal3 and CD44 was confirmed by western blotting ( Fig . 3b ) . Furthermore , we showed that 79 % ( means , n = 2 independent experiments , with 16 – 18 cells assessed from 6 fields ) of antibody - labelled endogenous Gal3 co - localized with endocytic structures that were positive for endogenous CD44 ( Fig . 3c ) . Likewise , exogenous Gal3 co - localized with endogenous CD44 at early times of uptake ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Both experiments strongly suggested that Gal3 and CD44 were internalized by the same endocytic carriers . Gal3 is required for CLIC formation To test the functional implication of Gal3 in CLIC formation , the lectin was depleted from TECs using distinct short interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ; Supplementary Fig . 5a , d ) . Although CD44 cell surface levels were not aﬀected in Gal3 - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) , CD44 uptake was strongly inhibited ( Fig . 4c , d and Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Addition of exogenous Gal3 rescued CD44 uptake ( Fig . 4c ) in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 4d ) . Significant rescue was obtained with the serum - level Gal3 concentration of 10ngml − 1 , and maximal rescue at 1 µ gml − 1 , which is at the lower end of Gal3 binding aﬃnities for carbohydrates with optimal branching 29 , or for serum proteins 38 . Back - addition of 0 . 8 µ gml − 1 of exogenous Gal3 to Gal3 - depleted cells yielded endogenous labelling intensities ( Fig . 4e , f ) , indicating that this concentration indeed restored natural Gal3 levels in cells . When Gal3 was added back at 10 µ gml − 1 to Gal3 - depleted MEFs , CD44 uptake was not rescued any more ( Fig . 4d ) . It is likely that at such high concentrations , glycoproteinswerecrosslinkedintoanextendedlattice thereby preventing uptake . An N - terminal deletion mutant of Gal3 that lacks critical clustering determinants ( termed Gal3 (cid:49) Nter ; ref . 39 ) was much less eﬃcient at rescuing CD44 uptake ( Fig . 4d ) , strongly suggesting that Gal3 oligomerization was of critical importance for its endocytic function . Interestingly , Gal3 failed to rescue CD44 uptake on GSL - depleted cells ( Fig . 4c ) . These findings established a functional link between Gal3 and GSLs in CD44 endocytosis . β 1 - integrin is one of the most predominant interacting partners of Gal3 ( ref . 40 ; Fig . 3a , b ) , and the protein was identified as a top hit of CLIC - associated proteins by mass spectrometry 8 . Here we found that its endocytic uptake was inhibited in Gal3 - depleted MEFs ( Fig . 4g and Supplementary Fig . 5d , e ) . The uptake of β 1 - integrin was also sensitive to clathrin depletion ( Fig . 4g and Supplementary Fig . 5d , e ) , suggesting the existence of multiple uptake routes that may be selected on the basis of extra - and intracellular conditions . β 1 - integrin surface levels were similar in all conditions , except for a slight reduction in the clathrin and Gal3 double depletion condition ( Supplementary Fig . 5f ) . Depletion of Gal3 also reduced the formation of fluid - phase HRP - labelled CLICs ( Fig . 4h and Supplementary Fig . 5g ) . As the impairment was only partial , we concluded that many but not all CLICs required Gal3 for their biogenesis . Similar conclusions were reached when lactose was used as a competitive inhibitor of galectin function : the inhibitory eﬀect on CD44 uptake was very strong ( Supplementary Fig . 6a – c ) , whereas fluid - phase HRP CLIC formation ( Supplementary Fig . 6d , e ) and dextran fluid - phase uptake ( Supplementary Fig . 6f , g ) were only partly reduced . In summary , Gal3 was recruited to N - glycosylated proteins , was required for uptake of CD44 and β 1 - integrin , and for CLIC formation . N - glycosylation of CD44 required for uptake CD44 is a glycoprotein with 5 N - and at least 7 O - glycosylation sites 41 , 42 . Inhibition of N - glycosylation using 1 - deoxymannojirimycin reduced the average density of CD44 molecules in clusters , and CD44 cluster size ( Fig . 5a , b and Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . CD44 uptake was strongly perturbed in MEFs treated with the N - glycosylation inhibitors 1 - deoxymannojirimycin , kifunensin or swainsonine ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 7c ; see Supplementary Fig . 7d , e for unchanged CD44 surface levels ) . In addition , we generated a CD44 mutant for which all 5 N - glycosylation sites were eliminated . This CD44 - 5xN - Glyc mutant failed to be taken up into cells ( Fig . 5d , e ; see Supplementary Fig . 7f , g for unchanged CD44 surface levels ) . These findings clearly established the importance of N - glycosylation on CD44 clustering and uptake . Gal4 also localizes to CLICs Gal4 binds to GSLs ( ref . 27 ) and forms cluster at the plasma membrane 43 . We therefore investigated whether Gal4 could also be linked to the CLIC pathway . A proteomics analysis of Gal4 interacting partners yielded a markedly diﬀerent profile compared with that of Gal3 ( Fig . 3a , bottom part , and Supplementary Fig . 4d and Table 1 ) . This reflects the distinct preference of Gal3 and Gal4 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 16 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2014 595 © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .

At early times of uptake ( 30s ) , most intracellular carriers indeed contained either Gal3 ( green ) or Gal4 ( red ; Fig . 5f ) . Quantification using Manders’ coeﬃcients revealed that only 35 . 1 ± 3 . 6 % of Gal3 structures were also Gal4 positive , and 56 . 7 % ± 11 % of Gal4 structures were also Gal3 positive .

Gal3 and Gal4 thus associated with overlapping but distinct endocytic environments . On the basis of electron microscopy analysis , HRP - conjugated Gal4 strongly localized to very early endocytic carriers with tubular and ring - shaped CLIC morphologies ( Fig . 5h ) . Its distribution between CLICs and other uptake structures was similar to that of Gal3 ( compare Figs 1f and 5i ) . In combination with the immunofluorescence data on limited overlap of Gal3 and Gal4 at early times of uptake ( Fig . 5f ) , we concluded that Gal3 and Gal4 most likely labelled diﬀerent CLIC populations . 596 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 16 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2014 © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

This result mirrored the inhibition of CD44 endocytosis ( Fig . 1c ) and Gal3 - CLIC formation ( Fig . 1f ) under GSL - depletion conditions . We next examined Gal3 - CLIC cargoes on Gal3 tubular uptake structures . As expected from Gal3 binding ( Fig . 3a , b ) and Gal3 - mediated uptake ( Fig . 4c , d , g ) , 65 . 6 % ( means , 196 tubules pooled from 2 independent experiments ) , 61 . 3 % ( means , n = 191 tubules pooled from 2 independent experiments ) , and 53 . 6 % ( means , n = 140 tubules pooled from 2 independent experiments ) of tubular Gal3 structures ( red ) co - labelled with β 1 - integrin ( Fig . 6e , green ) , α 5 - integrin ( Fig . 6f , green ) , or CD44 ( Fig . 6g , green ) , respectively . In contrast , only 4 . 4 % ( means , n = 216 tubules pooled from 2 independent experiments ) of Gal3 tubules ( red ) also labelled for Tf receptor ( TfR ; Fig . 6h , green ) . Gal3 tubules thus contained a specific complement of Gal3 binders and CLIC cargo proteins . The B - subunit of the bacterial Shiga toxin ( STxB ) interacts with α - but not with β - galactosidic linkages to which Gal3 binds . STxB was previously shown to induce tubular uptake structures after binding to the GSL globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ; ref . 46 ) . Here , we found that STxB ( green ) and Gal3 ( red ) localized to diﬀerent tubule populations on the same cells ( Fig . 6i ) . This finding demonstrated that distinct curvature - generating environments were obtained when endocytosis was driven by lectins with diﬀerential glycan - binding characteristics . In conclusion , these experiments showed that Gal3 favoured the GSL - dependent formation of plasma membrane invaginations containing specific Gal3 interacting proteins , whose processing by scission required active cellular machinery . Membrane - bound Gal3 drives membrane bending To directly address the role of Gal3 in membrane bending , we turned to a liposome reconstitution system . Giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) were prepared with a plasma - membrane - like lipid composi - tion containing cholesterol ( 20mol % ) , sphingomyelin ( 12mol % ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoylphosphatidyl choline ( POPC , 59 . 9mol % ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoylphosphatidyl serine ( POPS , 3mol % ) , a GSL mixture ( 5mol % , see Experimental Procedures ) , and 0 . 1mol % lissamine - rhodamine - B - PE for visualization . The GSL mixture contained lipid species that were also found in the cells that were used in the present study ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ) . Gal3 did not directly bind to these GSL - containing GUVs , in agreement with the notion that Gal3 has low aﬃnity for GSLs ( ref . 29 ) and needs glycosylated proteins for its recruitment onto membranes ( Supplementary Figs 4b , c and 7d , e ) . Therefore , we His - tagged Gal3 ( Gal3 – His ) to force its binding to nickel - chelating lipid ( 3mol % ) - containing GUV membranes , thus mimicking the binding of Gal3 to cargo proteins at the plasma membrane . At early time points , Gal3 – His was evenly distributed on NTA - containing GUVs ( Fig . 7a , 5min ) . At 15min , Gal3 was enriched locally ( arrows and inset ) , and after 30min 65 . 3 % of GUVs showed tubular membrane invaginations ( see Supplementary Table 4 for a summary of observations and quantificationforallGUVexperimentsshowninthisfigure ) . 3 . 0 ± 1 . 6 invaginations ( n = 38 GUVs ) were counted per equatorial plane of GUVs to which Gal3 had bound , with an average length of 1 . 9 ± 1 µ m ( n = 113 invaginations ) . Gal3 was enriched 2 . 5 - fold ( ± 0 . 9 , n = 113 ) in these invaginations , when compared with the limiting membrane . Membrane tubules were at background levels when Gal3 – His was incubated with GUVs that did not contain GSLs ( Fig . 7b ) , that contained 5mol % glucosylceramide , lactosylceramide , or Gb3 , or when GSL - mixture - containing GUVs were incubated with a His - tagged GST – GFP control protein ( Fig . 7c ) . To disrupt carbohydrate - mediated interactions of Gal3 with GSLs , we incubated GUVs with Gal3 – His in the presence of lactose as a competitive inhibitor . Under these conditions , Gal3 – His failed to cluster and form tubules on GSL - containing GUVs ( Fig . 7d ) , demonstrating that Gal3 required direct interaction with the carbohydrate part of GSLs to deform membranes . This important conclusion was confirmed with a carbohydrate - binding - deficient His - tagged Gal3 mutant , Gal3 - R186S , which did not induce invaginations on GSL - containing GUVs either ( Fig . 7e ) . Gal3 interacts with β - but not with α - galactosidic linkages . To characterize the involvement of specific carbohydrate structures in the tubulation process further , we treated GSL - containing GUVs with diﬀerent galactosidases . Incubation with β - galactosidase abolished the tubule - forming potential of Gal3 – His , whereas α - galactosidase had no eﬀect ( Fig . 7f and Supplementary Video 4 ) , again pointing to a requirement of Gal3 - carbohydrate interaction with GSLs for membrane bending . Taken together , membrane - bound Gal3 induced inward - oriented tubulation on GUVs in a GSL - dependent manner . Gal3 oligomerizes on membranes The His - tagged Gal3 (cid:49) Nter mutant is lacking the oligomerization domain and failed on cells to rescue CD44 uptake as eﬃciently as wild - type Gal3 ( Fig . 4d ) . To analyse the contribution of oligomerization to tubule formation , we used this mutant in our GUV system . Gal3 (cid:49) Nter had a strongly reduced capacity to induce tubules ( Fig . 7g ) , indicating that Gal3 clustering was important for membrane bending . Direct evidence for Gal3 clustering came from experiments in which non - His - tagged Gal3 ( which did not bind to GUVs on its own ) was recruited by Gal3 – His onto GUVs ( Fig . 7h ) . These data clearly demonstrated the ability of Gal3 to interact with membrane - bound Gal3 – His and consequently the propensity of Gal3 to undergo oligomerization 20 , 21 . In contrast , non - His - tagged Gal3 (cid:49) Nter failed to be recruited by Gal3 – His ( Fig . 7i ) , in complete agreement with the notion that this protein has a reduced clustering capacity . The carbohydrate - binding mutant Gal3 - R186S without a His - tag was bound to GUVs by Gal3 – His ( Fig . 7j ) , indicating that sugar interactions were not strictly required for oligomerization . On cells , this mutant failed to bind ( Fig . 7k ) , but was internalized when co - incubated with wild - type Gal3 ( Fig . 7l ) . Thus , we demonstrated the propensity of Gal3 to undergo oligomerization on cell and model membranes . DISCUSSION On the basis of the findings of this study , we propose a model to explain the initiation of CLIC biogenesis ( Fig . 8 ) . Monomeric Gal3 is recruited to membranes by binding to glycosylated cargo proteins , such as CD44 and β 1 - integrin . Membrane - bound Gal3 oligomerizes and acquires functional GSL interaction capacity . This is likely to involve an avidity eﬀect based on multiple bond interactions of binding sites on oligomeric lectins with several GSL molecules , and / or the creation of GSL - binding sites at interfaces between Gal3 600 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 16 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2014 © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

This model provides an integrative hypothesis of how cargo proteins are recruited and membranes bent in a process of clathrin - independent endocytosis . For CD44 , endocytic uptake relies extensively on the mechanism presented here . For β 1 - integrin , clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytic contributions have previously been identified 47 , and our mechanism probably explains the clathrin - independent uptake . Indeed , β 1 - integrin functions have also been described to be reliant on N - glycosylation 48 and GSL expression 49 , as one would expect from our model . An ‘endocytic balance’ may thereby be set through an intricate interplay between diﬀerent clustering mechanisms driven from the cytosolic ( that is , coat - dependent ) and extracellular ( that is , galectin and glycosylation - dependent ) sides of the plasma membrane . In addition to CD44 and β 1 - integrin , a number of other proteins are at the same time Gal3 binders and CLIC proteomics hits , including lysosomal - associated membrane protein - 2 ( Lamp - 2 ) , nicastrin subunit of γ - secretase , 4F2 heavy chain ( CD98 ) , the GPI - anchored protein CD109 , mannose 6 - phosphate receptor , collectin - 12 and prosaposin .

We propose the following model to explain the Gal3 - driven initiation of CLIC biogenesis . Monomeric Gal3 is recruited to membranes by binding to glycosylated cargo proteins , such as CD44 and β 1 - integrin . Membrane - bound Gal3 oligomerizes and gains functional GSL binding capacity . Co - clustering of cargo proteins and GSLs generates mechanical stress to which the membrane responds by forming endocytic invaginations . See discussion for further details . diﬀerent cell types ( TECs versus MEFs , respectively ) , this overlap list may represent an underestimation of candidate proteins whose uptake might be mediated by Gal3 . On the basis of the fluid - phase uptake results , we conclude that Gal3 directly drives the biogenesis of a fraction of CLICs . At the same time , these experiments indicate that not all CLIC formation is dependent on Gal3 . Other galectins could be alternative biochemical drivers , as exemplified here for Gal4 . Whether additional classes of lectins or sphingolipid - interacting proteins also contribute remains to be addressed . Furthermore , actin - driven mechanisms of glycolipid clustering , as described for GPI - anchored proteins 50 , could in principle also generate endocytic nanoenvironments similar to the ones described here . Various studies have reported on stimulatory and inhibitory eﬀects of galectins on endocytosis 23 , 51 – 55 . Our finding that CD44 uptake is stimulated at serum - level concentrations of Gal3 , but inhibited with Gal3 concentrations that are several orders of magnitude above serum levels provides an explanation for these apparently contradictory re - ports . Our model predicts that protein glycosylation and GSL expres - sion contribute to setting the domain boundary between regimes of endocytic nanocluster formation ( as described here ) , and the forma - tion of extended lattices leading to inhibition of internalization 23 . In conclusion , we here propose a mechanism in which Gal3 functions like an endocytic adaptor that drives the clathrin - independent biogenesis of endocytic pits by linking glycosylated cargo proteins and GSLs into compositionally defined nanoenvironments at the plasma membrane .

Two - phase partitioning was performed as described previously 62 withminor modifications . Four millilitres of di - isopropyl ether / 1 - butanol ( 6 : 4 , v / v ) was added to the dried extract , vortexed and sonicated , followed by adding 2ml 50mM NaCl ( aq . ) . The mixture was again vortexed and sonicated for several minutes and then centrifuged to separate the phases . The upper organic phase was transferred to a glassvialandsavedforsubsequentalkalinehydrolysis . Theloweraqueousphasewas re - extractedwith4mlofdi - isopropylether / 1 - butanol ( 6 : 4 , v / v ) , vortexed , sonicated for several minutes and centrifuged . The organic phase was removed and saved for subsequent alkaline hydrolysis . Aqueous phases from both extraction steps were pooled , dried in a vacuum centrifuge , and re - dissolved in 1ml methanol / water ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) with vortexing and sonication . For recovery of gangliosides by solid phase extraction , aqueous phase collected after two - phase partitioning was cleaned - up by solid - phase extraction 63 . Supelclean LC - 18 SPE columns ( Supelco ) were successively preconditioned with 10ml methanol , 20ml chloroform / methanol ( 2 : 1 , v / v ) , 10ml methanol , and 20ml methanol / water ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) . The aqueous phase was loaded onto the column . The column was washed with 40ml H 2 O , and gangliosides were eluted with 2ml methanol and 10ml chloroform / methanol ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) mixture . The ganglioside fraction was dried and re - dissolved in 150 µ l of chloroform / methanol ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) . For alkaline hydrolysis of the organic phase , 1ml of 0 . 2M NaOH in methanol was added to the dried sample , incubated at 30 ◦ C for 120min and neutralized by adding 8 µ l of acetic acid . Chloroform ( 1ml ) and water ( 2ml ) were added and the mixture vortexed for 1h at 21 ◦ C . The lower organic phase was transferred to a glass vial , dried in a vacuum centrifuge and re - dissolved in 150 µ l chloroform / methanol ( 2 : 1 , v / v ) . Thin - layer chromatography was performed on Silica gel 60 F254 plates ( 20 × 20cm ; Sigma - Aldrich ) in chloroform / methanol / CaCl 2 ( 65 : 35 : 8 ) and stained with 20 % H 2 SO 4 . For lipid analysis by shotgun mass spectrometry , 2 µ l aliquots of the cell extracts prepared as described above were 160 - fold diluted with 7 . 5mM ammonium acetate in 2 - propanol for positive - mode analyses and 20 - fold with 0 . 05 % triethylamine in methanol for negative - mode analyses . The total ganglioside extract ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) used as a reference was dissolved in chloroform / methanol / water ( 65 : 35 : 8 , v / v ) at the concentration of 1mgml − 1 and diluted 100 - fold for analyses in positive and negative modes . ShotgunlipidomicsanalyseswereperformedonaQExactivemassspectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) equipped with a robotic nanoflow ion source TriVersa NanoMate ( Advion BioSciences ) . FT MS spectra were acquired for 1min within the range of m / z 450 – 1750 at the target mass resolution of R = 140 , 000 ( full - width at half - maximum at m / z 200 ) and automated gain control ( AGC ) of 1 × 10 6 . Lipid species were identified using LipidXplorer software 64 by their m / z determined in MS survey scans with better than 3 ppm accuracy and a signal to noise ratio above the value of 3 . 0 . The molecular fragmentation query language ( MFQL ) queriesrequiredforthelipididentificationareavailableattheLipidXplorer wiki site at https : / / wiki . mpi - cbg . de / lipidx / Main _ Page . Lipid loadings were adjusted accordingtothetotalproteincontentdeterminedbytheBCAproteinassay ( Pierce ) . Species of the following lipid classes were monitored : sphingomyelins , ceramides , hexosylceramides , di - hexosylceramides , GA2 , GA1 / Gb4 ( were not distinguished becausetheyhaveidenticalmasses ) , Gb3 , GD1 , GM3 , GM2 , GM1 , GT1 , GD3 , GD2 , GT3 , GT2 , GQ1 , GP1 , sulphatides , Forssman antigen . To confirm the identity of thin - layer chromatography bands , they were scraped fromtheunstainedplateandextractedwith500 µ lofchloroform / methanol ( 2 : 1 , v / v ) for 20min at room temperature . After centrifugation for 15min at 4 ◦ C the supernatant was carefully collected , transferred into a glass vial and dried under a nitrogenstream . Thedriedsamplewasre - suspendedin100 µ lchloroform / methanol ( 2 : 1 , v / v ) and analysed as described above . Model membrane studies . GUVs were prepared essentially as described previously 65 . A thin film of lipid mixtures ( 2mgml − 1 ) containing POPC ( 56 . 9mol % ) , cholesterol ( 20mol % ) , sphingomyelin ( 12mol % ) , POPS ( 3mol % ) , GSL - mix ( 5mol % ) , Ni - NTA - DOGS ( 3mol % ) and lissamine - rhodamine - PE ( 0 . 1mol % ) was applied to glass slides covered with indium - tin oxide ( Delta Technologies ) and placed into a custom - made Teflon chamber . The GSLmix was a total ganglioside extract from porcine brain and contained the trisialoganglioside GT1b ( 44 . 5 % ) , disialogangliosides GD1a ( 33 % ) , GD1b ( 8 % ) and GD1bL ( 7 % ) , and monosialogangliosides GM1 ( 6 . 5 % ) , GM2 ( 0 . 66 % ) and GM3 ( 0 . 33 % ) . The glass slides were separated by a 2mm thin sucrose solution ( 600mM ) . An electric a . c . field ( 0 . 389V RMS , 10Hz ) was applied for 2 . 5h at 65 ◦ C following the previously described GUV electroformation protocol 66 . Liposomes were collected after cooling to 21 ◦ C and used immediately . A 200 µ l observation chamber ( Lab - Tek chambered # 1 . 0 borosilicate ) was coated using 2mgml − 1 BSA to avoid distortion of GUVs on contact with the chamber and rinsed with imaging buﬀer ( 10mM HEPES at pH 7 . 2 , 590mM glucose ) . One hundred microlitres of GUVs in 600mM sucrose was mixed with 100 µ l of Gal3 – His , Gal3 - R186S – His , Gal3 - R186S or GFP – GST – His in imaging buﬀer to yield 200nM ( that is , 5 µ gml − 1 of Gal3 – His , respectively ) final concentrations in 300mM sucrose . The buﬀer and proteins added to GUVs matched the osmolarity of the GUV solution . The solution was stirred to accelerate protein distribution and binding . A buﬀer control was performed for each experiment . This control was treated exactly the same as the actual experiment ; however , only buﬀer and no recombinant protein was added .

GFP / Alexa - 488 dyes were excited using the 488nm argon laser , and rhodamine was excited with a 543nm He / Ne laser . GFP and Alexa488 emission was collected with 505 – 530nm , and rhodamine emission with 560 – 615nm bandpass filters . The pinholes for each channel were set for an approximate 0 . 8 – 1 . 1 µ m optical slice . To prevent light - induced artefacts , images were acquired with an approximate interval of 5min for each condition . For lipid mixtures without GSLs or without Ni - NTA - DOGS , both lipids were replaced by POPC . Gal3 sorting on GUV tubules was calculated using fluorescence intensities ( Int ) of Alexa488 – Gal3 normalized by the mean intensity of lissamine - rhodamine - PE according to ref . 67 : Sorting ( S ) = ( Int ( Gal3 tubule ) / Int ( Gal3 membrane ) ) / ( Int ( PE - rhodamine tubule ) / Int ( PE - rhodamine membrane ) ) . Galactosidasetreatmentswith 10Uml − 1 of α - galactosidase ( Sigma G8507 , green coﬀee beans ) or β - galactosidase ( Sigma G5160 , Aspergillus oryzae ) of GUVs containing total GSL - mixture was performed for 60min at 37 ◦ C before Gal3 incubation by mixing GUVs in sucrose with the digestion / imaging buﬀer ( final concentration : 10mM HEPES at pH 6 . 5 , 5mM CaCl 2 , 300mM sucrose , 290mM glucose ) . 56 .

Supplementary Note 1 : dSTORM imaging and data processing Sample preparation : Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37˚C with Gal3 - Alexa647 at a concentration of 4 µ g * ml - 1 in serum - free DMEM supplemented or not with PPMP , and then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37˚C . For Gal3 - dependent CD44 clustering in cells treated with 1 - deoxymannojirimycin , cells were incubated for 20 min at 37˚C with Gal3 at a concentration of 4 µ g * ml - 1 in the presence of 1 - deoxymannojirimycin . Subsequently , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37˚C and stained for CD44 using an Alexa - 647 labelled antibodies directed against CD44 . Reversible photoswitching of Alexa - 647 fluorophores in dSTORM experiments was performed in a redox buffer composed of 25 mM Hepes and 5 % glycerol in PBS , pH 8 , using an oxygen scavenger system made of 0 . 05 mg * ml - 1 glucose oxidase , 0 . 025 mg * ml - 1 horseradish peroxidase , 75 mM cysteamine , and 25 mM glucose 1 . dSTORM images were acquired on a TIRF microscope ( ELYRA ; Zeiss ) with a 100x , NA = 1 . 46 oil - immersion objective . For imaging , a 633 nm laser was used for excitation and a 488 nm laser for conversion from the dark state . 15 , 000 - 20 , 000 images were acquired per sample using an electron - multiplying CCD ( EMCCD ) camera ( iXon DU - 897D , Andor ) with an exposure time of 40 ms . For data processing , point spread function ( PSF ) fitting and localization was performed in Zen 2010D ( Zeiss Microscopy ) . Single molecules were identified as areas with an intensity - to - noise ratio greater than 6 . The centre of each PSF was calculated by fitting to a 2 - dimensional Gaussian distribution . Sample drift was corrected by tracking immobile gold fiducial markers . To prevent over - counting due © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

From each dSTORM image , 4 µ m x 4 µ m non - overlapping regions were selected for analysis . Events with localization precision worse than 50 nm were discarded . For each analysed region , Ripley’s K - function was calculated as : K r = A ( ! ! " ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) where δ ! " = 1 if δ ! " < r , else 0 Equation 1 Here , n is the number of points contained in an analysed region of area A ( 4 µ m x 4 µ m ) . d ij is the distance between two points i and j and r is the analysed spatial scale . Localizations at the edge of the analysed region were weighted to negate edge effects . The K - function is a measure of the number of points encircled within concentric circles of radius r centred on each point and scales with circle area . It is therefore transformed into the L - function to obtain linear scaling with radius , r via Equation 2 : ! ! = ! ( ! ) ! Equation 2 Random distributions have L ( r ) = r at all r . We therefore plot L ( r ) - r versus r . Positive values of L ( r ) - r at a given r indicate clustering at that spatial scale . 99 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were generated by simulating 100 spatially random distributions . To generate cluster heat maps , L ( r ) values at a spatial scale of 50 nm , L ( 50 ) , were computed for each point individually ( Equation 3 ) . ! ! 50 = ! ( ! ! " ! ! ! ! ! ) ! where δ ! " = 1 ! " δ ! " < 50 , ! " # ! 0 Equation 3 © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . Values of L ( 50 ) were interpolated to form a cluster heat map ( MATLAB , The Mathworks ) . By applying a threshold of L ( 50 ) = 78 to this map , a binary cluster map was created from which cluster statistics ( number , size , shape , molecules / cluster ) was extracted . This method has previously been demonstrated to extract clustering parameters from PALM and dSTORM data at the plasma membrane 1 - 3 . Statistical significance of the means of two data sets was assessed with Student t - tests ( Prism , GraphPad Software ) . Crucial to PALM and dSTORM data analysis is the correct identification of single molecules and avoidance of over - counting molecules whose fluorescence has ceased and re - appeared . To correct for this effect we used an accepted method of analysis first published by Annibale et al . 4 , and later modified by Rossy et al . 1 to include two different time - scales of blinking . We fitted Gal3 - Alexa647 data to the following equation ( 4 ) : ! t ! = N 1 + ! ! " # $ % ! ! ( ! ! ! ! ! ! " " ! ) + ! ! " # $ % ! ! ( ! ! ! ! ! ! " " ! ) Equation 4 Here N ( td ) is the number of molecular counts at different off gaps ( td ) where off - gap is the maximum time period a molecule is dark before being identified as a different molecule when its fluorescence resumes ; N is the number of fluorescent molecules ; nblink1 and nblink2 are the average number of counts a molecule converts to a dark state ; toff1 and toff2 is the average lifetime of the fluorophore . We corrected for the factors described above using clustering data of HeLa cells treated with PPMP and untreated control cells . As an additional control , we have performed dSTORM experiments with Gal3 - Alexa647 molecules adhered to clean coverslips imaged under © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . the identical parameters as the cell samples . For all samples the duration of the acquisition was 20 , 000 frames at 30 ms per frame . We plotted the number of localized Gal3 - Alexa647 molecules in representative images versus the off - gap and fitted the data to equation 4 ( Supplementary Figure 2i - k ) . Alexa647 - Gal3 exhibited 0 . 25 blinks for 0 . 26 frames ( 7 . 8 ms ) and 0 . 77 blinks for 6 . 2 frames ( 186 ms ) in HeLa control cells , and 0 . 16 blinks for 0 . 25 frames ( 7 . 5 ms ) and 0 . 44 blinks for 7 . 7 frames ( 231 ms ) in PPMP treated cells . Alexa647 - Gal3 molecules adhered to coverslips displayed 0 . 19 blinks per molecule for 0 . 5 frames ( 15 ms ) and 0 . 2 blinks for 22 frames ( 660 ms ) . Based on this analysis , an off - gap threshold of 40 frames was applied . With this threshold , and the exclusion of molecules with localisation precisions > 50 nm , Alexa647 - Gal3 molecules adhered to clean coverslips was not completely random ( probably due to Gal3 aggregation in solution and aggregation of denatured Gal3 on the surface ) , but was 6 - fold lower than Galectin3 - Alexa647 molecules in HeLa ( Supplementary Figure 2h ) . 1 .
