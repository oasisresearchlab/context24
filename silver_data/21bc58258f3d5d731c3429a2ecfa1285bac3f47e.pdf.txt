The small GTPase rab5 has been shown to represent a key regulator in the endocytic pathway of mammalian cells . Using a PCR approach to identify rab5 homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , two genes encoding proteins with 54 and 52 % identity to rab5 , YP / 51 and YF / 53 have been identified . Sequencing of the yeast chromosome XI has revealed a third rab5 - like gene , YF / ~ 2 , whose protein product exhibits a similar identity to tab5 and the other two YPT gene products . In addition to the high degree of identity / ho - mology shared between rab5 and Ypt51p , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p , evidence for functional homology between the mammalian and yeast proteins is provided by pheno - typic characterization of single , double , and triple de - letion mutants . Endocytic delivery to the vacuole of two markers , lucifer yellow CH ( LY ) and a - factor , was inhibited in Aypt51 mutants and aggravated in the double ypt51ypt52 and triple ypt51yptS2yptS3 mutants , suggesting a requirement for these small GTPases in endocytic membrane traffic . In addition to these defects , the here described ypt mutants displayed a number of other phenotypes reminiscent of some vacuolar protein sorting ( vps ) mutants , including a differential delay in growth and vacuolar protein matu - ration , partial missorting of a soluble vacuolar hydro - lase , and alterations in vacuole acidification and mor - phology . In fact , vps21 represents a mutant allele of YPT51 ( Emr , S . , personal communication ) . Altogether , these data suggest that Ypt51p , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p are required for transport in the endocytic pathway and for correct sorting of vacuolar hydrolases suggesting a possible intersection of the endocytic with the vacuolar sorting pathway . I N eukaryotic cells endocytosis is a basic process by which extracellular molecules are internalized by invag - inating and pinching off parts of the plasma membrane . This membrane transport pathway has been extensively stud - ied also in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using two endocytic markers , Lucifer yellow CH ( LY ) ~ to follow fluid - phase endocytosis and c ~ - factor to follow receptor - mediated endocytosis ( for review see Riezman , 1993 ) . The availability of a large pool of mutants and the ease of isolation of novel ones has made the budding yeast S . cerevisiae an excellent system to study the in vivo functions of proteins in the process of endocytosis and to identify novel components of the endocytic machinery .

Genetic screens for mu - tants defective in the internalization of endocytic markers and their delivery to the vacuole have furthermore resulted in the identification of End3p and End4p ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) and Renlp / Vps2p ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) , whose precise func - tions in endocytic membrane traffic are however yet un - known . Another class of proteins that is believed to be required for endocytic transport is the family of small GTPases , known as Ypt family in yeast and rab family in mammalian cells . Their key regulatory role in intracellular membrane traffic was initially demonstrated with the help of conditional lethal yeast mutants , see4 and yptl , in the secretory pathway ( Sal - minen and Novick , 1987 ; Segev et al . , 1988 ; Schmitt et al . , 1988 ) . In mammalian cells a large number of proteins be - longing to the rab family have been identified due to their similarity in primary structure to Yptlp and Sec4p ( Hau - brnck et al . , 1987 ; Touchot et al . , 1987 ; Zahraoui et al . , © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 95251941041283116 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , Number 2 , April 1994 283 - 298 283 1989 ; Chavrier et al . , 1990 ) . Some of these GTPases have been localized to distinct subcellular compartments of both the exocytic and endocytic pathways ( for review see Zerial and Stenmark , 1993 ) . Members of the rab family that are specifically associated with elements of the endocytic apparatus are rab4 , rab5 , rab7 , and rab9 . Whereas rab4 and rab5 are located on early endosomes ( Chavrier et al . , 1990 ; van der Sluijs et al . , 1991 ) and have a regulatory function in early steps of endocytosis ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ; van der Sluijs et al . , 1992 ) , rab7 and rab9 are associated with late endosomes and therefore are in - volved in later steps of the pathway ( Chavrier et al . , 1990 ; Lombardi et al . , 1993 ) . In S . cerevisiae a homolog of rab7 , Ypt7p , has recently been identified ( Wichmann et al . , 1992 ) . The ypt7null mutant is characterized by a delay of endocytic delivery of or - factor to the vacuole and by defects of vacuolar protein sorting and maturation ( Wichmann et al . , 1992 ) . In contrast to the proposed involvement of rab7 and Ypt7p in later steps of endocytosis , studies on rab5 have suggested a key regulatory role of this small GTPase in early endocytic traffic . Rab5 was found to be required for the fusion of early endosomes in vitro ( Gorvel et al . , 1991 ) . In vivo , overex - pression of the wild - type protein in BHK ceils led to in - creased internalization of endocytic markers and to the ap - pearance of very large early endosomal structures ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ) . Conversely , expression of a mutant form of rab5 , rab5Ile ~ 33 , inhibited endocytosis and resulted in fragmenta - tion of early endosomes . In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe a homo - log of rab5 , ypt5p , has been identified recently ( Armstrong et al . , 1993 ) . However , no experimental data are yet avail - able that suggest any function for this protein in endocytosis in the fission yeast ( Armstrong et al . , 1993 ) . Here we report the isolation of three genes from the bud - ding yeast S . cerevisiae that encode Ypt proteins with exten - sive homology to mammalian rab5 and the S . pombe ypt5p . The defects associated with single , double , and triple null mutants of YF / ~ I , YP ~ 2 , and Y / r / ~ 3 suggest an important function of the encoded proteins in the delivery to the vacu - ole of two endocytic markers , a - factor and LY . Furthermore , due to a number of vacuole - associated defects found for the here described ypt mutants , such as protein sorting , acid - ification and morphological changes , a requirement of these Ypt proteins for vacuole biogenesis can be envisaged .

The initial PCR reaction was carried out in a volume of 20 / ~ l and con - sisted of 30 cycles of I rain each at 940C , 2 rain at 60°C , and 1 rain at 72 " C , with a final 5 rain extention at 72 " C . The reaction volume was increased to 100 ~ tl and a second round of amplification was performed using the same conditions as described above . The reaction product of , , o200 bp was gel purified and labeled with o ~ 32p - dCTP ( 3 , 000 Ci / mmol ) using the random primer labeling kit ( Boehringer Mannheim ) . To isolate full length clones of the respective genes , , ~ 40 , 000 E . coli colonies ( transformed with the genomic library ) were screened with the 32p - labeled PCR reaction prod - uct . Plating of bacteria onto nitrocellulose filters on LB - Ampicillin plates and preparation of replica - filters were done by standard procedures ( Sam - brook et al . , 1989 ) . After lysing the cells with base and baking the filters for 2 h at 80°C , they were extensively washed with 3x SSC , 0 . 1 % SDS at 680C to remove bacterial debris . Prehybridization was perfiarmed for 2 h at 680C in 6x SSC , 5x Denhard ' s solution , 100 / ~ g / ml herring sperm DNA and 0 . 5 % SDS . Hybridization was done for 12 h at 68 " C in 6x SSC , lx Danhard ' s solution , 100 / tg / ml yeast tRNA and 32p - labeled PCR reaction product at approximately 3 × 105 cprn / ml . Filters were washed with 2 × SSC , 0 . 1 % SDS at 680C four times for 15 min and exposed wet against x - ray films ( XARS ; Eastman Kodak Co . , Rochester , NY ) . All positive clones identified in the initial screening were isolated and streaked out to obtain single colonies . 5 - 10 of these colonies were subjected to a second round of screening ( as described above ) . Positive clones were restreaked and sin - gle colonies were subjected to a third round of rescreening as described above . Plasmids were isolated from the positive clones using Qiagen columns ( Diagen , D0sseldorf , Germany ) as described by the manufacturer . To determine the nucleotide sequences of the respective clones , a de - generate oligonucleotide , representing a protein sequence motif that can be found in most Ypt / rab proteins , was used as a primer in dideoxy sequencing of double - stranded plasmid DNA . Sequencing was done according to the method of Winship ( 1989 ) using Sequenase Version2 . This revealed that out of the 15 clones isolated , nine represented YPTSI ( four different subclones ) , three represented YF / 53 ( one subcloue ) , and three represented so far unidentified clones ( different subelones ) . The coding sequence of YP ' / 51 and YP / 53 were determined from both strands by using nested primers . Disruption of YPTSI , YPT52 , and YPT53 Large internal parts of the genes YP ' / 51 , YP ' / 52 , and YP ~ 3 were deleted from the genome and replaced with the LYS2 , the URA3 , and the LEU2 gene , respectively . Using the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , the genomic flanking regions on either side of YP / 51 were amplified from pSEYS - BS6 to generate a 205 - nucleotide fragment corresponding to the 5 ' flanking region ( 5 ' FR ) ( nucleotides 385 - 589 ) and a 267 - nucleotide frag - ment corresponding to the 3 ' flanking region O ' FR ) ( nucleotides 1083 to 1349 ) . The ~ inner ~ oligonucleotides , i . e . , those immediately flanking the YP ' / 51 gene , were designed to create restriction sites for HindlII . The " outer " oligonucleotides contained restriction sites for ClaI ( 5 ~ ' R ) and EcoRI ( YFR ) . The two PCR products were purified from an agarose gel and used as a template in a second round of PCR , which used as primers the two outer oligonucleotides used in the first PCR reactions . The major prod - uct of this reaction was digested with ClaI and EcoRI and subcloned into pBSK ( - ) ( Stratagene ) . The resulting plasmid was opened with HindHI and a 4 . 7 - kb LYS2 fragment was ligated between the 5 ' FR and the 3 ' FR . Plasmid pBS - YPT51LYS2 , containing the predicted insert , was linearized with ClaI and Sinai , the latter enzyme cutting ten nucleotides Y of the EcoRI site in the polylinker ofpBSK ( - ) , and used to transform the diploid strain RH1201 in a one step gene replacement ( Orr - Weaver et al . , 1981 ) . After selecting for growth on plates in the absence of lysine , colonies were sporulated at 24 " C . Tetrad dissection was then performed and the cells derived from different spores were grown up at 24°C and examined as described below . The disruption of YP / 53 was performed by the same strategy as described for YP ' / 51 . The genomic flanking regions on either side of YP ' / 53 were am - plified from pSEY8 - HSVI to generate a 196 nucleotide 5 ' FR ( nucleotide 418 to 613 ) and a 206 nucleotide spanning 3 ' FR ( nucleotide 1150 to 1355 ) . The inner oligonucleotides were designed to create restriction sites for XhoI , the outer oligonucleotides contained restriction sites for BamHI ( 5TR ) and PstI ( 3 ' FR ) . After two rounds of PCR ( see above ) the reaction product was subcloned into pGEM1 ( Promega Corp . , Madison , WI ) , opened with XhoI and a 2 . 2 - kb XhoI / SaLl fragment containing the LEU2 marker was introduced . The resulting plasmid ( pGEM - YIrI ~ 3LEU2 ) was linearized with BamHI and PstI . Transformation and dissection of Leu + transformants was carried out as described above . To create a loss - of - function allele of YP / 52 , a 2 . 4 - kb YP / 52 - containing genomic fragment resulting from exonuclease / XbaI digest was subcloned into pBSK ( - ) to generate pBS - YPT52 and a 799 - nucleotide EcoRV / EcoRV fragment containing the entire coding sequence of the gene was replaced by a 1 . 2 - kb Hindlll / HindI ~ fragment containing the URA3 gene . The resulting plasmid ( pBS - YPT52URA3 ) was linearized with KpnI ( contained in pBSK ) and XbaI and used for subsequent transformation of diploids . The null alleles of YP / 51 and YP / 53 contained a deletion of codon 31 to 195 ( inclusive ) and codon 31 to 209 ( inclusive ) , respectively . The null allele of YP / 52 did not contain any coding sequence information . To determine integration of the respective constructs by site - specific recombination , DNA was prepared from cells derived from the four spores of complete tetrads was prepared ( Philippsen et al . , 199D . PCR was per - formed with a primer of the respective olignnucleotide that binds 5 ' from the sequence that was used for homologous recombination of the three respective genes and a primer that binds to sequences within the 5 ' region of the respective marker genes . With the mutants , amplification of a corre - sponding DNA fragment indicated that the marker gene integrated at its proper location , whereas with wild - type DNA no such amplification oc - curred . Additionally , Southern hybridization was performed with wild - type and mutant strains to confirm proper integration of the respective marker genes . For this , chromosomal DNA of the various strains was digested with EcoRI , separated on 0 . 8 % ( to analyze disruption of YP / 51 and YP / 53 ) or 0 . 6 % ( to analyze disruption of YP / 52 ) agarose gels and transferred to Gene - Screen Plus membranes ( Dupont - NEN ) as suggested by the manufacturer . Probes for YP ' / 51 and YP / 53 were prepared by PCR , using the respective outer oligonucleotides described before , gel purified , and labeled with digoxigenin as suggested by the manufacturer ( Boehringer Mannheim ) . To analyze disruption of YP ' / 52 two probes were prepared : a digoxigenin - labeled EcoRV / ECORV fragment containing the coding region of YPTS2 , and a KpnI / BglII fragment containing the 5 ' non - coding region of YP / 52 . Prehybridization and hybridization of probes with the filter and detection using anti - digoxigenin Fab fragment labeled with alkaline phosplmtase was performed according to the protocol provided by Boehringer Mannheim . Correct integration and disruption of the respective lq°T genes were indi - cated by the following results : replacement ofa " ~ 5 - kb lq ~ l fragment in the wild type by a ~ 9 - kb fragment in the Iq " / ' 31 - disrupted strain ; appear - ance of a " , ~ 6 . 8 - and 3 . 1 - kb fragment in a ypt53 mutant versus an " ~ 8 . 6 - kb fragment in the wild type strain ; appearance of a ~ 8 . 2 - kb fragment in a ypt52 mutant versus a ~ 7 . 8 - kb fragment in the wild - type strain using the KpnI / BglII probe , or disappearance of the 7 . 8 - kb band in the ypt52 mutant using the EcoRV / EcoRV Iq " / ~ 2 probe . a - Factor Internalization and Degradation Assays Pheromone internalization and degradation assays were carried out as de - scribed by Dulic et ai . 0991 ) , using biosynthetically labeled 3sS - , - factor . Both assays were performed with the various strains grown overnight at 24 " C . Binding of the pheromone was done for 1 h on ice , internalization at 30°C . The disappearance of intact , internalized a - factor ( pH 1 . 2 sample ) was quantified by densitometric scanning as described ( Singer and Riez - man , 1990 ) . LY - CH Accumulation LY internalization experiments were essentially performed as described by Dulic et al . ( 1991 ) . The various strains were grown to early logarithmic stage overnight at 24°C and LY accumulation ( using 16 mg / mi final concen - tration ) was analyzed after internalization at 30°C for 1 h . The cells were observed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with fluorescence and Nomarski optics . Photographs were made using Kodak T - Max 400 films ( Eastman Kodak Co . ) exposed to ASA 1 , 600 . Exposures for fluores - cence were 30 s . To quantify the results obtained with ypt52ypt53 mutants as compared with wild type , cells with a clear vacuolar staining positive for LY were counted as positive , cells without vacuolar staining , but with recognizable vacuole by Nomarski were counted as negative . 150 cells were counted .

YptSlp , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p and Endocytosis 285 Staining of Vacuoles with Quinacrine and CDCFDA The different strains used for the analysis were grown overnight at 24°C to early logarithmic phase . For staining with quinacrine , 5 x 106 cells were collected and resuspended in 500 / ~ 1 YPD , 50 mM Na2HPO4 , pH 7 . 6 . Qulnacrine was added to 0 . 2 mM final concentration and staining was per - formed at RT for 5 rain . The cells were washed once in 2 % glucose , 50 m . M Na2HPO4 , pH 7 . 6 , and immediately viewed on concanavalin A - coated coverslips as described by Roberts et al . ( 1991 ) , using fluorescence and Nomarski optics . Photographs were made using Kodak T - Max P3200 films and exposures for fluorescence were done for 30 s . For staining with carboxydichlorofluorescein diacetate ( CDCFDA ) , 107 cells were re , suspended in 100 ~ d SD medium , 50 mM citric acid , pH 5 , 20 mM CDCFDA . After 20 rain at 30°C the cells were immediately viewed using either the Axiophot microscope or , alternatively , the EMBL confocal microscope ( excitation wavelength 476 nm ) . Photographs were made using Kodak T - Max 400 films exposed to ASA 1 , 600 ( Axiopho0 and Kodak T - Max 100 films ( confocal microscpe ) . Exposures for fluorescence were 30 s except for analysis of yptMypt52 and yptMypt52ypt53 mutants for which the exposure was reduced to 5 s . Thin Section Electron Microscopy Electron microscopy of cells that had been grown at 30°C to early logarith - mic phase was performed as described previously by Ossig et al . ( 1991 ) . Carboxypeptidase Y and Alkaline Phosphatase Biogenesis Cells of the various strains used in the analysis were grown overnight at 24°C in YPD medium to ' ~ 1 × 107 cells / m . Cells ( 5 × 107 per time point ) were harvested , washed two times with H20 and resuspended to 2 . 5 x 106 cells / m in SD medium containin ~ 2 % glucose , 100 ~ tM ammonium sulfate and nutrient supplements ( SD low sulfate ) . After incubation at 24°C for 5 h the cells were collected , washed once with H20 and resuspended to 2 . 5 x 107 cells / m in minimal medium as described above , but without sulfate ( SD no sulfate ) and with 0 . 5 ms / m1 bovine serum albumin . To label whole cells , a pulse was initiated at 30°C by the addition of 35Smethionine ( 40 ttCi / time point , 1 mCi / 66 / d ) and metabolic labeling conducted for 5 rain at 30°C . I ml of cells was removed ( and processed as described below ) , ammonium sulfate was added to 2 raM , and methionine and cysteine to 30 i ~ g / ml , each , to initiate the period of chase . 1 - ml samples were taken after 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , and 60 min . To terminate the reaction , the l - m samples were added to NaN3 and NaB ( final concentration 5 mM each ) and transferred to - 20°C . Finally , the cells were thawed and TCA was added to 6 % final concentration and protein was precipitated on ice for 30 rain . The precipitates were collected by centrifugation , washed twice with - 20°C acetone and dried . After addition of 100 / d of 50 mM Tris , pH 6 . 8 , 1 % SDS , 2 . 5 mM EDTA ( lysis buffer ) and acid - washed glass beads cell extracts were p ~ pared at 40C by vortexing for I mill at top speed . The extracts were clarified by centrifitgation and the supernatant was heated at 95°C for 5 rain . After centrifugation for 5 min in a microcentrif ~ e , the supernatant was diluted with 1 mi TNET 1 % ( wt / vol ) Triton X - 100 , 150 mM NaCI , 5 raM EDTA , 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 and 1x CLAP ( 5 / ~ g of each chymostatin , leupeptin , antipain and pepstatin , prepared from a 1 , 000X stock in DMSO ) . To remove material that binds nonspeciflcally to protein A - Sepharose beads , 100 / d of a 1 : 2 slurry of Sepharose CL - 4B in TNET was added and incubated for 1 to 2 h on a rocker at 4°C . The un - hound material was transferred to a fresh tube . For immunoprecipitation , 3 / ~ 1 of anti - carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) antiserum and 50 / ~ I of a 1 : 2 slurry of protein A - Sepharose CL - 4B in TNET was added and incubated with the labeled extracts overnight at 4°C . After collecting the beads by centrifuga - tion , the supernatant of each reaction was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti - alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) antibodies for 5 h at 4°C . The beads containing the anti - CPY immunocomplexes were washed five times with 1 ml TNET and resuspended in 60 ttl Laemmli sample buffer . The beads con - taining the anti - ALP immuncomplexes were washed once with TNET , once with 2 M urea , 2 M NaC1 , 1 % TXI00 , 100 mM Tris / HCl , pH 6 . 8 , once with TNET , and twice with 10 mM 1Yis / HC1 , pH 6 . 8 , 10 mM NaC1 . The immunoprecipitates were released from the beads at 95°C for 5 min and separated by SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions using 8 % gels . After electrophoresis the gels were fixed , treated with ENTENSIFY according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , dried and exposed to films at - 70°C for 5 ( CPY immunoprecipitation ) or 14 ( ALP immunoprecipitation ) days . To determine extracellular secretion of vacuolar enzymes , cells ( 2 x l0 s cells / m ) were treated in 0 . 1 M Tris / HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 0 . 14 M cysteamine , 1 . 2 M sorbitol , 5 mM EDTA for 15 rain at 30°C after incubation in SD low sulfate for 5 h as described above . 10 s cells were collected and converted into spheroplasts in a volume of 90 ~ 1 of SD no sulfate , 0 . 1 M Tris , pH 6 . 8 , 1 . 2 M sorbitol , 1 ms / m1 each of BSA and ovalbumin and 10 ~ tl lyticase . Af - ter incubation at 30°C for 45 mill , the spberoplasts were collected by cen - trifugation for 5 rain at 1 , 500 rpm , resuspended in the same medium except for lyticase , and pulse labeling was initiated by the addition of 6 / ~ 1 35Smethionine ( 1 mCi / 66 # 1 ) . After 15 min at 30°C , a chase period of 30 rain followed as described above . The reaction was stopped by the addition of NaN3 and NaB to 5 mM final concentration , each , and by chilling the spheroplasts to 4°C . The spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 1 , 500 rpm and the supernatant was withdrawn . Both , medium and spheroplasts , that were re . suspended in the medium used for labeling , were frozen and processed for successive immunoprecipitation with anti - CPY and anti - ALP antibodies as described above . Quantitation was per - formed on short exposures of fluorograms by densitometric scanning . The values for p2CPY and mCPY in the intracellular and extracellular fraction were added and considered as 100 % total . Cell extracts from overnight cultures grown at 24°C were prepared by collecting cells ( 50 OD units ) , washing them once with water and resus - pending them to 1 - 20D / mi in 0 . 2N NaOH , 0 . 5 % fl - mercaptoethanol . After a 10 - min incubation on ice , TCA was added to 10 % final concentration and proteins were precipitated on ice for 30 rain . The precipitates were collected by centrifugation , washed once with cold acetone and resuspended in I . atemmli sample buffer ( 10 OD / nd ) . After SDS - PAGE on 8 % gels the pro - teins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) . Western blot analysis was performed according to Singer and Riezman ( 1990 ) . The antiserum against CPY was used 1 : 1 , 000 diluted . Secondary goat anti - rabbit IgG conjugated to horseraddish peroxidase was used 1 : 3 , 000 diluted and detected with the ECL system ( Amersham ) . Results Identification of Three S . cerevisiae Genes , YPTM , Yt ~ 2 , and YPT53 , That Encode Proteins with Extensive Homology to rab5 and S . pombe ypt3p Mammalian cells express rabSA ( to which we refer as rab5 ) and two isoforms , rab5B and rab5C ( Chavrier et al . , 1992 ; Bucci , C . , A . Liitcke , V . Olkkonen , P . Dupree , K . Simons , and M . Zerial , manuscript in preparation ) which share se - quence identity in the range of 85 % . Recent data indicate that , similar to tab5 , rab5B and rab5C regulate trafficking in the early endocytic pathway . To identify putative homo - log ( s ) of rab5 in S . cerevisiae we first searched for an amino acid sequence motif specific for the tab5 subgroup . Com - parative analysis of all the available protein sequences re - vealed that the LAPMYYR motif is shared by all three mare - marian rab5 proteins whereas it is absent from all other rab / Ypt proteins . This sequence is located within the helix o ~ 2 of small GTPases ( nomenclature according to Pal et al . , 1989 ) , which is highly conserved between mammalian tab proteins and their yeast counterparts , such as rablA , rablB and Yptlp , and which contributes to the functional specificity of rab5 ( Stenmark et al . , 1994 ) . Two degenerate oligonucle - otides corresponding to the LAPMYYR sequence and to the GXXXXGKS / T motif found in the phosphate - binding loop of all rab / Ypt proteins ( Chavrier et al . , 1992 ) were used in the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) to amplify a putative YP75 gene ( s ) from S . cerevisiae genomic DNA . As determined by Southern blot analysis , upon labeling with 32p , the PCR reaction products hybridized to two distinct genomic DNA fragments ( not shown ) . The respective full - length clones were isolated from a genomic library and shown to represent two novel sequences . Analysis of the two identified clones re - vealed two intronless genes encoding small GTPases of the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , 1994 286 Figure 1 . Amino acid sequence of Ypt51p ( A ) , Ypt52p ( B ) and Ypt53p ( C ) and numbers of identity / homology shared between rab5 and Ypt proteins ( D ) . The boxed clear regions in A , B , and C repre - sent the a2 domain , the hatched segments correspond to the effec - tor domain ( see Results ) . The nucleotide sequence data are avail - able from EMBL / GenBank / DDBJ under the accession numbers X76173 SCYPT51 , X76174 SCYPT52 , and X76175 SCYPT53 , respectively . In D , the values of identity ( upper figure ) / homology ( lower figure ) for the different protein pairs were determined by the gap program of the GCG package . rab / Ypt protein family ( Fig . 1 ) with the closest identity and phylogenetic relationship to rab5 and S . pombe ypt5p ( data not shown ) . Based on these features , but in keeping with the conventional nomenclature used for S . cerevisiae genes , the two genes were named YP / 51 and YP / 53 ( see below ) . In - dependently , sequencing of the S . cerevisiae chromosome XI revealed an open reading frame , that codes for another pro - tein with a high sequence homology to rab5 , but which was distinct from YP / 51 and YF / 53 . This gene was subsequently named YF / ~ 2 ( Fig . 1 ) . Although YP ' / 52 contains the nucleo - tide sequence encoding the LAPMYYR motif , it was not identified by the PCR approach . This can probably be ex - plained by three mismatches at the 3 ' end of the degenerate oligonucleotide representing the GXXXXGKS / T motif . Be - cause all gene products were equally similar to rab5 , the gene with the major importance in respect to phenotypic al - terations ( see below ) was called YF / 51 , followed by YF / 52 and YP / 53 . The overall sequence identity / homology between all pos - sible pairs of rab5 / Ypt proteins was very similar and in the range of 54 % identity and 70 % homology , respectively . Computer analysis of all available rab / Ypt protein sequences to calculate their phylogenetic relationship revealed that mammalian rab5A , B , and C , S . pombe ypt5p and S . cerevisiae Ypt51p , Ypt52p and Ypt53p constitute a group among the members of this family ( data not shown ) . Further support for their close relationship is provided by the striking similarity in the effector domain , which in the case of p21 ~ is known to mediate interactions with the GTPase - activating protein ( Adari et al . , 1988 ; Cales et al . , 1988 ) . Ypt52p and S . pombe ypt5p contain identical effector domains ( RES - TIGAAF ) ( Fig . 1 ) , which differ from rab5 in only one amino acid . Ypt51p and Ypt53p , which contain identical effector domains , have two amino acid differences when compared with Ypt52p and rab5 , respectively ( Fig . 1 ) . Analysis of the codon usage , which is a reliable indicator of protein abundance in yeast ( Bennetzen and Hall , 1982 ) , revealed that on a scale in which 1 represents exclusive use of preferred codons , YF / 51 scored 0 . 18 , YP152B scored 0 . 23 , and YP / 53 scored 0 . 07 . This suggests that YP753 , most likely , encodes an extremely rare protein , whose putative low abun - dance is slightly above that of transcription factors ( 0 - 0 . 05 ) , whereas YP ' / 51 and YP ' / 52 encode proteins which lie in the typical range of other Ypt proteins , like Ypt7p ( 0 . 14 ) and Sec4p ( 0 . 21 ) . These data indicate that S . cerevisiae Yt ~ I , YFI52 , and YP753 are novel sequences which code for small GTPases sharing structural features with mammalian rab5A , B , and C proteins . Disruption Of YPTS1 And YP ' 1 " 52 Has a Synergistic Inhibitory Effect on Cell Growth To determine the function of Ypt5 lp , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p , we first constructed mutants with null alleles of YPT51 , YP752 , and YP / 53 alone , all possible pairs of double mutants and the triple yptSlypt52ypt53 null mutant . To generate single null mutants the disrupted genes and a selectable marker on a linear fragment were used to replace the respective wild - type genes in diploid strains , that were auxotrophic for the different markers . After sporulation and tetrad dissection it was observed that haploid progeny carrying either wild - type or the disrupted gene for YP ' I51 , YP752 , or YP / 53 formed colonies of similar size after growth at 24°C , suggesting that all three YPTgenes are non - essential . All possible combina - tions of double mutants and the triple mutant were obtained by crossing haploid null mutants , followed by tetrad dissec - tion of the respective diploids . The haploid double and triple mutants also did not show any growth defect upon incubation at 240C . However , when precultures of wild - type and mutant ceils grown at 24°C were diluted into YPD medium at 370C , Aypt51 mutants were delayed in growth , whereas Aypt52 and Singer - Krfiger et al . Ypt51p , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p and Endocytosis 287 Aypt53 mutants propagated like wild - type ceils ( Fig . 2 A ) . Disruption of YP / 53 in combination with YF / ~ I or YF / 52 did not change the growth properties of the latter two single mutants ( Fig . 2 B ) . In contrast , in the double yptSlypt52 mu - tant growth was further inhibited at 37°C ( Fig . 2 B ) as com - pared with the single ypt51 null mutant , and a mild delay of growth could already be observed at 30°C ( not shown ) . The triple ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutant was viable and had similar growth properties to the double ypt51ypt52 mutant ( compare Fig . 2 B with A ) . ypt51 , ypt52 , and ypt53 Mutants Internalize re - Factor Normally , but Are Defective in Pheromone Degradation To investigate a possible role of the three Ypt proteins in en - docytosis , the internalization of the mating pheromone a - factor was analyzed . 35S - or - factor internalization assays were performed at 300C with cells that had been grown at 24°C . At those temperatures no major growth defects could be observed , which might negatively influence the assay . The results showed that none of the mutants were defective for a - factor binding and intervaliTation ( data not shown ) . Both the rate of internalization and the total amount of endocy - tosed pheromone in all three single and the triple null mu - tants were indistinguishable from wild - type cells . The degradation of internalized a - factor was then ana - lyzed by separating the intact and degraded forms of ~ sS - labeled pheromone by thin layer chromatography .

Precultures of the corre - sponding strains were grown to stationary phase at 240C . To initiate growth the cells were diluted into YPD medium and incubated at 37 " C . Aliquots were taken at the times indicated to measure the op - tical density at 600 nm . wild - type cells , that had completely degraded the phero - mone after 30 rnin of internalization ( Fig . 3 A ) , single null mutants of YP ~ 2 and YP ~ 3 degraded the pheromone with normal kinetics ( data not shown ) , ypt52ypt53 mutants re - vealed a minor delay in pheromone degradation , since small amounts of intact u - factor were still present after 30 rain of incubation at 30 " C ( Fig . 3 B ) . In contrast , pheromone degradation was strongly inhibited in ypt51 mutants ( Fig . 3 C ) . The tta for ol - factor degradation was prolonged to about 50 min as compared with 10 rain in wild - type cells . ypt51ypt52 ( Fig . 3 E ) and ypt51ypt53 ( Fig . 3 D ) mutants dis - played a further delay in o ~ - factor degradation as com - pared to single ypt51 mutants , with a tu ~ of pheromone deg - radation of about 60 and 75 min , respectively . Triple ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants ( Fig . 3 F ) seemed to be almost blocked in pheromone degradation , since the tu ~ was more than 120 min . These results indicate that disruption of the YF / ~ I gene does not affect ix - factor internalization but causes a severe in - hibition of pheromone degradation . Furthermore , this effect is aggravated by the additional disruption of YP ~ 2 and YP753 . yptS1 , ypt52 , and ypt53 Mutants Are Defective in Vacuolar LY Accumulation The observed lack of pheromone degradation in the here de - scribed ypt mutants could be explained by an inhibition of transport from an endocytic compartment to the site of degradation , the vacuole . To test this hypothesis , we inves - tigated the ability of the various mutants to deliver LY to the vacuole , As compared with wild - type ceils ( Fig . 4 A ) , single mutants for YP ~ 2 ( Fig . 4 B ) and YF / ~ 3 ( not shown ) re - vealed no defect in the accumulation of the fluorescent dye in the vacuole . In contrast , Aypt51 mutants were character - ized by a strong reduction in the amount of LY accumulation in the vacuole ( Fig . 4 C ) . The majority of cells showed a very weak or no detectable fluorescence in the region of the vacu - ole , which was generally recogniTable by Nomarski optics . Only in rare cases did LY accumulate in the vacuole in simi - lar amounts as observed for wild - type cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . In - terestingly , disruption of both YPTS1 and YF / 52 further de - creased LY transport to the vacuole ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) , since even the occasionally observed weak fluorescence of vacu - oles could not be detected . This phenotype was especially noteworthy in light of the fact that the majority of mutant cells contained the typically large vacuole , as seen in wild - type cells . Occasionally , cells of double as well as triple mu - tants revealed a remarkably bright intracellular fluores - cence . This bright staining could sometimes be resolved into tiny spots ( Fig . 4 , D , E , and F , , arrowheads ) . As detected by Nomarski optics , these particular cells did not contain a large vacuole like wild - type cells , but rather exhibited a granular surface similar to class C vps mutants lacking vacu - oles ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . ypt51ypt53 mutants appeared very similar to ypt51 mutants , in that occasionally a weak vacuo - lar staining by LY could be observed ( Fig . 4 D ) . However , in difference to the latter mutant a few cells showed the spotty fluorescence as described for the yptSlypt52 mutant ( Fig . 4 , E and F , , arrowheads ) . Therefore , additional disrup - tion of YF / 753 in Aypt51 mutants resulted in a phenotype which was stronger than observed for ypt51 and weaker than The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , 1994 288 Figure 3 . or - factor degradation by ypt mutants as compared to wild - type cells , a ~ cells of the respective strains were grown overnight at 24°C to early logarithmic stage . After incubation with 35S - or - factor for 1 h at 0 * C the cells were collected and resuspended in YPD medium and transferred to a 30°C waterbath to start internalization of the pheromone . Total cell - associated ( pH 1 . 2 washed cells ) ( 1 ) and internalized ix - factor ( pH 6 washed cells ) ( 6 ) was extracted at the times indicated and resolved by thin layer chromatography .

Although the majority of cells with a disrupted copy of both YP ' / 52 and YP ' / 33 showed no defect in LY accumulation ( data not shown ) , it appeared that the number of cells without dye accumulation was in - creased as compared to wild - type cells . Whereas typically " ~ 95 % of wild - type , ypt52 and ypt53 cells revealed staining of the vacuole with LY , this number was reduced to about 50 % in double ypt52ypt53 mutants . ypt51 , ypt52 , and ypt53 Mutants Display a Delay in the Maturation of a Soluble and a Membrane - bound Vacuolar Enzyme and also Partially Mlssort a Soluble Vacuolar Marker Protein As in mammalian cells , the endoeytic and the vacuolar sort - ing pathways in S . cerevisiae have been proposed to intersect in a prevacuolar , endosomal compartment 0 / ida et al . , 1993 ; Schimm611er and Riezman , 1993 ; Davis et al . , 1993 ) . The finding that the here described Ypt proteins are required for transport of LY and possibly of a - factor to the vacuole sug - gests that delivery of enzymes to the vacuole via the secre - tory pathway could also be affected in the ypt51 , ypt52 , and ypt53 mutants . To test this , transport of the vacuolar hydro - lases carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) to the vacuole was analyzed . The transit of soluble CPY through the secretory pathway can be monitored by the appearance of its different intermediate forms . Cleavage of the signal peptide and core glycosylation in the ER generate a 67 - kD form , plCPY , which is transported to the Golgi complex , where the core oligosaccharides are extended , yielding p2CPY ( 69 kD ) . Finally , just before or upon arrival of p2CPY in the vacuole the NH2 - terminal prosequence is removed to yield mature ( m ) CPY ( 61 kD ) ( Stevens et al . , 1982 ) ( Fig . 5 ) .

Thus , maturation of ALP appeared to be less severely per - turbed in the here described ypt mutants than maturation of CPY . In view of the observed delay in the maturation of vacuolar enzymes , the possibility had to be considered that a fraction of vacuolar enzymes is not properly sorted to the vacuole , but instead missorted to the extracellular space , a phenotype associated with a number of vacuolar protein sorting ( vps ) mutants ( Robinson et al . , 1988 ; Rothrnan et al . , 1989a ) . To examine this , spheroplasts of the various mutants and of wild - type cells were pulse labeled for 15 min and chased for 30 rain . After termination of the chase period by addition of NaN3 and NaF , the intraceilular and extracellular fractions were separated and two successive immunoprecipitations were performed with CPY and ALP antisera . As shown in Fig . 6 A , wild - type , ypt52 , ypt53 and ypt52ypt53 cells con - tained mainly mCPY which was present in the intracellular fraction , suggesting proper targeting to the vacuole . In con - trast , substantial amounts of Golgi - modified p2CPY ( (cid:127)40 % of total ) was found in the extracellular fraction of Aypt51 mutants , providing evidence for missorting of this soluble enzyme . In fact , vps21 ( Robinson et al . , 1988 ) is a mutant allele of YF / 31 ( Emr , S . , personal communication ) . Addi - the 71 - kD mature form ( mALP ) occurs in the vacuole by PEP4 - dependent processing ( Klionsky and Emr , 1989 ) . Pulse - chase labeling with [ 35S ] methionine was performed with ceils that had been grown at 24°C . After a pulse of 5 min at 30°C , the cells were chased for various periods of time at 30oc , and the radioactive CPY and ALP were suc - cessively immunoprecipitated from total cellular protein and subsequently analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Conversion of pl to p2CPY and maturation to mCPY took place with normal kinetics in Aypt52 ( Fig . 5 ) and Aypt53 ( not shown ) mutants as compared with wild - type ceils . In ypt52ypt53 double mu - tants , despite of a 5 - min delay in the conversion from pl to p2 CPY , processing to the mature form occurred normally . Interestingly , Aypt51 mutants exhibited a dear delay in the processing of p2 to mCPY . While in wild - type cells , x , 50 % of p2CPY was processed to mCPY by 10 rain of chase , in mutant cells a similar degree of processing was only ob - served after 20 - - 30 rain of chase , ypt51ypt52 and ypt51ypt52 - ypt53 mutants were charactedred by a further delay in this maturation step , since a chase of approximately 60 rain was required to yield 50 % of both p2 and mCPY ( Fig . 5 ) . Maturation of membrane - bound ALP was also perturbed in mutant cells lacking Ypt proteins . However , while in ypt51ypt52 and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants 50 % of mALP was formed only after 20 rain , as compared with 5 - 10 min in wild - type cells , in all other mutants the processing of this Figure 6 .

Singer - Krfiger et al . YptSlp , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p and Endocytosis 291 tional disruption of either YP ~ 2 or Y / r / 53 increased the ra - tio of external to internal CPY suggesting enhanced missort - ing . Approximately 55 and 50 % of total CPY was present extraceilularly in ypt51ypt52 and ypt51ypt53 mutants , respec - tively . Furthermore , increasing amounts of intracellular p2CPY versus mCPY accumulated in ypt51ypt53 and even more in ypt51ypt52 mutants . The triple ypt51ypt52ypt53 mu - tants displayed the highest degree of CPY missorting ( (cid:127)60 % of total ) and the strongest defect in precursor accumulation . Although upon pulse - chase labeling of ypt51ypt52 and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants small but clearly detectable quanti - fies of mCPY could be detected , as shown in Fig . 5 , in the experiment of Fig . 6 A the amounts of mCPY seemed to be reduced in favor of increased quantifies of p2CPY . This ap - parant discrepancy in the results most likely can be ascribed to the fact that spheroplasts on the one hand ( more precursor accumulation ) and intact ceils on the other hand ( less precur - sor accumulation ) were used . A similar result was obtained in studies of vacuolar protein maturation with vacuolar acidification ( va0 mutants fKlionsky et al . , 1992 ) . As expected for a membrane protein , missorting of ALP to the extracellular medium could not be detected in any of the different ypt mutants ( Fig . 6 B ) . As seen in pulse - chase labeling experiments ( data not shown ) , precursor accumula - tion could be detected only in ypt51ypt52 and ypt51ypt52 - ypt53 mutants . We also determined the steady state levels of mCPY and mALP in the various mutants as compared with wild - type cells . This was done by Western analysis of protein extracts prepared from cultures grown overnight at 24 " C . Surpris - ingly , ypt51 mutants revealed no detectable amounts of mCPY as compared with wild - type cells and the other single ypt mutants ( Fig . 6 C ) . This is in apparent contrast to the results obtained by pulse - chase labeling experiments , in which the generation of mCPY could clearly be observed in the Y / r / ~ l - disrupted ceils , and suggests a reduced stability of mCPY over longer periods of time . The steady - state levels of mALP were reduced to " ~ 50 % of wild - type levels in ypt51 and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants ( data not shown ) . To exclude the possibility that in the absence of Ypt51p , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p the secretory transport pathway was affected in a more general way , we also investigated the secretion efficiency of invertase and the mating pheromone c ~ - factor . A comparison of wild - type cells with the different ypt null mutants revealed that both marker proteins were secreted with normal kinetics ( data not shown ) . In conclusion , while these results reveal no secretion defects and only slight perturbations of ALP maturation in ypt51ypt52 and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants , the kinetics of CPY maturation were increasingly impaired by the successive disruption of YF / ~ I , YF / ~ 2 , and Y / U ~ 3 , and missorting of CPY was simultanously increased . Furthermore , it appeared that the steady state level of mCPY was strongly reduced in Aypt51 mutants . Acidification Properties Are Disturbed in the Here Described ypt Mutants In view of the missorting defect associated with some of the ypt mutants the possibility existed that this phenotype could be related to improper vacuole acidification . Precedents for this are a number of vps mutants ( Banta et al . , 1988 ; Preston Figure 7 . Vacuole acidification as determined by Quinacrine stain - ing is defective in ypt51 and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants .

The cells were washed once in 2 % glucose , 50 mM Na2HPO4 , pH 7 . 6 , and immediately viewed on concanavalin A - coated coverslips using Nomarski and fluorescence optics .

Missorting of vacuolar enzymes can also be caused by rais - ing the pH specifically of the vacuolar system by treatment with the drug bafilomycin A ~ ( Banta et al . , 1988 ; Klionsky and Emr , 1989 ) . Vacuole acidification can be microscopi - cally detected by staining living yeast cells with the lyso - somotrophic agent quinacrine , a fluorescent dye that accu - mulates in acidified organelles ( Weisman et al . , 1987 ) . As shown in Fig . 7 A , wild - type ceils revealed a bright vacuolar fluorescence , as did ypt52 , ypt53 , and ypt52ypt53 null mutants ( not shown ) . In contrast , this staining was strongly reduced in cells with a disrupted copy of YP ' / 31 ( Fig . 7 B ) , and was virtually absent in ypt51ypt52 ( not shown ) and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants ( Fig . 7 C ) .

Bars : ( A - C ) 1 / ~ m ; ( / 9 and E ) 0 . 5 pm . demonstrated that the absence of Ypt51p and Ypt52p results in a severe acidification defect of the vacuolar system . To exclude the possibility that improper vacuole acidifica - tion could have been the primary reason for the observed lack of oMactor degradation rather than an endocytic deliv - ery defect , pheromone degradation was analyzed in vat2 mu - tants disrupted for a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase . These cells display similar defects in vacuole acidification than YP ' / 31 - disrupted mutants . Interestingly , in spite of a delay in c ~ - factor degradation to a t ~ of 16 min in vat2 cells ( data not shown ) as compared with wild - type ceils ( 10 rain ) , this delay was much less severe than observed for ypt51 , and es - pecially for ypt51ypt53 , ypt51ypt52 , and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mu - tants ( see above ) . It is therefore highly unlikely that the lack of or - factor degradation in the here described ypt mutants was mainly caused by a lack of acidification . Vesicle Accumulation and Vacuolar Morphology in yptS1 , ypt52 , and ypt53 Mutants As Ypt51p , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p are likely to act in the endo - cytic and vacuolar protein sorting pathways , a morphological investigation by electron microscopy of ypt51 and yptS1 - ypt52ypt53 mutants as compared to wild - type ceils was initi - ated . Potassium permanganate fixation and staimng was chosen , as it allows visualization of membrane structures without the need to remove the cell wall . It was observed that the ypt51 null mutant ( Fig . 8 , B and D ) as well as the triple Singer - Krflger et al . YptSlp , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p and Endocytosis 293 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , 1994 294 yptSlypt52ypt53 mutant ( Fig . 8 C and E ) accumulated small vesicular structures with a diameter of (cid:127)40 - 60 urn . Com - pared with wild - type ( Fig . 8 A ) , cells of both mutant strains contained on average 6 - 7 - fold more of these vesicles . With respect to size , these structures resembled the vesicles ac - cumulating in yeast mutants that are blocked in transport be - tween the ER and the Golgi ( Kaiser and Schekman , 1989 ; Becker et al . , 1991 ) . As we did not find any evidence for an impairment of CPY transport to the Golgi or for inhibition of protein secretion in Ypt51p - depleted cells , these accu - mulating type of vesicles are likely to represent transport in - termediates between organdies other than the ER and the Golgi , perhaps endosomes . Besides these morphological changes , thin section EM analysis did not reveal any other gross morphological changes , for example of the vacuolar system . However , due to the changed acidification properties and the appearance of small structures positive for LY in some of the ypt mu - tants , we also analyzed the vacuolar morphology on a larger cell population by light microscopy , using the vital stain carboxydichlorofluorescein diacetate ( CDCFDA ) . Vacuolar labeling presumably results from diffusional uptake and sub - sequent hydrolysis of the dye by non - specific esterases , generating a fluorescent hydrolysis product ( Pringle et al . , 1989 ) . In contrast to the microscopic analysis performed with LY , in which the cells were treated with energy poisons to stop endocytosis at a certain stage , these experiments were performed with metabolically active cells . Under these " optimal " conditions , typical vacuoles appear as multiple ir - regularly shaped organdies clustered in a certain region of the cell ( Conradt et al . , 1992 ) ( Fig . 9 , A , B , K , and L ) . Dur - ing certain stages of the cell cycle a process termed vacuole inheritance induces the formation of so - called vacuolar segregation structures , which are projections formed by mother cell vacuoles leading into the developing bud ( Weis - man et al . , 1987 ) ( Fig . 9 , B , C , and K , arrowheads ) . Typical vacuoles and vacuolar segregation structures ( ar - rowheads ) , as found in wild - type cells , were also observed in ypt52 , ypt53 ( not shown ) , and ypt52ypt53 null mutants ( Fig . 9 , C and D ) . In contrast to the convoluted vacuolar shapes of wild - type cells , vacuoles of ypt51 mutants ap - peared completely spherical and as single structures ( Fig . 9 E ) . Furthermore , the typical ~ racks " formed by vacuolar material leading into the developing bud were never ob - served in these mutants , although larger buds clearly con - tained vacuoles . The spherical type of vacuole was also predominantly found in ypt52ypt53 mutants ( Fig . 9 F ) . However , numerous unusually small and bright structures were occasionally observed in these cells ( Fig . 9 G ) . This type of staining became more frequent in ypt51ypt52 and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants ( Fig . 9 , H and I ) . Analysis of these cells by Nomarski optics revealed that the typical larger vacuolar organelles were replaced by much smaller struc - tures . Confocal microscopy further resolved these brightly fluorescent entities into structures that seemed partly inter - connected to form a CDCFDA - positive network ( Fig . 9 , M and N ) . In summary , while EM analysis revealed the accumulation of small vesicular structures in thin sections of ypt51 and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants , subtle and differential morpholog - ical alterations of the vacuolar system could be observed in a small subset of the various ypt mutants with the help of a vital stain and light microscopy , which enables analysis of a large fraction of cells . Discussion Structural and Functional Similarities between YptSlp , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p and Mammalian rob5 Proteins In the present study three new members of the Ypt / rab fam - ily , YptSlp , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p , were identified in S . cere - visiae , that share a high degree of identity / homology to rab5 . Three criteria suggest that these small GTPases are structural homologs of rab5 . First , a significant identity ex - ists between the sequences of each of these Ypt protein and rab5 ( 48 - 54 % ) . The identity is not as high as that between Yptlp and rablA ( 71 % ) ( Haubruck et al . , 1987 ) , or Ypt7p and rab7 ( 63 % ) ( Wichmann et al . , 1992 ) . On the other hand , rab8 , which is required for transport from the TGN to the plasma membrane ( Huber et al . , 1993 ) , thus providing evi - dence for functional similarity to Sec4p , is the closest struc - tural homolog of Sec4p with 51 % identity ( Chavrier et al . , 1992 ) . Second , some of the structural elements that confer functional specificity to rab / Ypt proteins ( located in the ct2 - helix LAPMYYR and effector domain Stouten et al . , 1993 ) ( Brennwald and Novick , 1993 ; Dunn et al . , 1993 ; Hanbruck et al . , 1989 ; Hengst et al . , 1990 ; Stenmark et al . , 1994 ) are highly conserved between rab5 and YptSlp , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p . Third , the phylogenetic analysis , which reflects the sum of similarities of individual sequence ele - ments , clearly indicates that the rab5 proteins and the pro - posed S . pombe and S . cerevisiae homologs constitute a sub - group among all known small GTPases of the Ypt / rab family . In addition to protein similarity , our data support the no - tion that , similar to tab5 , the here described Ypt proteins are involved in the regulation of transport in the endocytic path - way . A strong inhibition of LY accumulation in the vacuole was observed for the single Aypt51 mutant , which was fur - ther aggravated by the additional deletion of YP ~ 2 and YP / ~ 3 . Furthermore , although ypt51 , ypt51ypt52 and ypt51 - ypt52ypt53 null mutants displayed normal a - factor internal - ization rates , they were strongly impaired in oe - factor deg - radation . As this process occurs in the vacuole , also this phenotype could be explained by an endocytic transport de - fect . This hypothesis is supported by the finding that , so far , Figure 9 . Vacuole morphology of various ypt mutants as compared with wild - type cells using CDCFDA as a vital stain . W ' dd - type and mutant cells were grown at 24°C to early logarithmic phase and resuspended in SD medium containing 50 mM citric acid , pH 5 , and CDCFDA . After 20 rain of staining at 30°C the cells were immediately viewed on concanavalin A - coated coverslips using a conventional fluorescence microscope equipped with Nomarski and fluorescence optics ( A - I ) . Due to the increased fluorescence associated with ypt51ypt52 and yptSlypt52ypt53 mutants the exposure time for micrographs was reduced sixfold as compared with the micrographs showing all other strains . Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to analyze wild - type ( K and L ) and ypt51ypt52ypt53 ( M and N ) cells .

Vacuolar segregation structures are indicated by arrowheads . Bars , 5 / ~ m . Singer - Kriiger et al . Ypt51p , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p and Endocytosis 295 endocytic mutants ( with recognizable vacuole ) have all been shown to be defective in transport of both LY and cx - factor ( Ktibler and Riezman , 1993 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ) . However , the surprising finding that Aypt51 mutants displayed a dra - matic reduction in the intracellular levels of mCPY under steady state conditions might suggest that inhibition of phero - mone degradation could also be the result of a defect in vacuolar protease activity . While we cannot completely rule out this possibility , we think it is unlikely . The observation that proteinase A - dependent maturation of CPY and ALP is affected but does take place ( even in ypt51ypt52 and ypt51 - ypt52ypt53 mutants ) suggests that the processing and degra - dative potential of the various ypt mutants is not severely im - paired . Therefore , since pheromone degradation also depends on proteinase A ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) , it should take place if cx - factor were present in the vacuole . Thus , we favor the idea that the lack of or - factor degradation in the here de - scribed ypt mutants is due to impaired transport to the site of degradation . In conclusion , these data suggest that Ypt51p , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p are structurally and functionally related to rab5 , al - though , without complementation analysis , we cannot de - finitively state at the present time that they correspond to the yeast counterparts of rab5A , B , and C . Multiple Pheuotypes of yptJl , ypt52 , and ypt53 Mutants Suggest an Intersection of the Endacytic and Vacuolar Protein Sorting Pathways Besides the defect in the delivery of endocytic markers to the vacuole , the various ypt mutants displayed phenotypes that are reminiscent of vps mutants ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . These include a delay in the maturation of vacuolar hydro - lases , partial missorting of the Golgi form of vacuolar CPY to the extracellular space , acidification defects and subtle morphological alterations of the vacuolar system . In fact , vps21 ( Robinson et al . , 1988 ) represents a mutant allele of YP ~ I ( Emr , S . , personal communication ) . In light of the multiple phenotypes displayed by the here described ypt mutants , the question could be raised whether the defect in acidification may be responsible for the missort - ing of p2CPY and the inhibition of or - factor degradation . Previous studies have revealed that lack of vacuolar acidifi - cation has severe implications on intracellular transport pathways . Treatment of ceils with bafilomycin A1 , a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase , results in missorting of CPY ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) to the same extent as observed for the Aypt51 mutants . However , neither missorting of ALP ( Klionsky and Emr , 1989 ) nor a major defect in oL - factor deg - radation occurs ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) . In mutants dis - rupted for a gene encoding a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase ( vat2 or vatB ) the extent of missorting of CPY to the extra - cellular medium was similar to that ofbatilomycin M - treated cells , while maturation of p2CPY to mCPY was further de - layed and precursor ALP accumulated ( Klionsky et al . , 1992 ) . Nevertheless , even if o ~ - factor degradation was de - layed in vat2 cells , its tu2 was only 16 min , whereas in Ypt5 lp - depleted cells it was prolonged to 48 min . Therefore , while it is possible that the acidification defect in the here described ypt mutants leads to missorting and precursor ac - cumulation of vacuolar enzymes , it seems unlikely that it could be the primary reason for lack of a - factor degradation . It rather seems that the phenotypes displayed by ypt51 , ypt52 , and ypt53 mutants could well be explained by a trans - port defect affecting an endoeytic organdie which is con - nected with the vacuolar sorting pathway . Experimental evi - dence for the meeting of the two pathways comes from cell - fractionation analysis , which reveals that p2CPY and endocytosed , - factor cofractionate in a prevacuolar / endo - somal compartment ( Vida et al . , 1993 ) . Independently , stud - ies with the ypt7 null mutant have suggested that meeting of endocytosed o ~ - factor with vacuolar hydrolases might occur before delivery to the vacuole , since a PEP4 - dependent and energy - independent pheromone degradation can be observed in this mutant ( Schimm611er and Riezman , 1993 ) . Finally , the finding that Renlp , a protein identified for its role in the delivery of or - factor receptor to the vacuole , is identical to Vps2p ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) , which is required for vacuolar protein sorting , also provides further evidence for the inter - section of the endocytic with the vacuolar protein sorting pathway . Site of Function of Ypt5 Proteins Due to the complexity of the ypt51 - , ypt52 - , and ypt53 - associated phenotypes , it is too early to pinpoint the precise step controlled by these Ypt proteins . However , phenotypic comparison between Aypt7 and the here described ypt mu - tants provides some dues about the order in which these small GTPases might function . Ypt7p , the yeast homolog of mammalian tab7 which is associated with late endosomes ( Chavrier et al . , 1990 ) , has been suggested by Wichmann et al . ( 1992 ) to play a role in the endocytic transport of o ~ - factor to the vacuole . As in the here described ypt mutants , indirect evidence for this was a substantial delay of endocytosed pheromone degradation in a Aypt7 mutant . A number of ob - servations support the idea that Ypt51p , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p proteins may act at an earlier step in the endocytic pathway than Ypt7p . First , by comparing the patterns of degradation in ypt7 and ypt51 , ypt52 , and ypt53 mutants obtained under the same experimental conditions , it becomes clear that a - factor degradation is more severely inhibited in the latter mutants . Second , vacuole fragmentation can be predomi - nantly observed in Aypt7 mutants , but is only occasionally seen in the here described ypt mutants . Third , since in yeast at least two kinetic endosomal intermediates ( early and late endosomes ) can be distinguished ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ; Singer - Kriiger et al . , 1993 ) , it is interesting to note that recent studies on the ypt7 null mutant have revealed an accumulation of endocytosed o ~ - factor in a gradient fraction enriched for late endosomes ( Schimm6ller and Riezman , 1993 ) . This suggests that Ypt7p is required for transport from late endosomes to the vacuole ( Schimm611er and Riezman , 1993 ) . Conversely , preliminary cell fractionation experi - ments suggest that upon internalization of , - , - factor into the ypt51 null mutant , the pheromone accumulates in a prevac - uolar endocytic comparanent , most likely in early endo - somes as defined by Singer - Krdger et al . ( 1993 ) ( Singer - Kriiger , B . , and M . Zerial , unpublished observations ) . The proposed order of function of Ypt51p and Ypt7p would be in accordance with the proposed successive function of mam - malian rab5 and rab7 . Future experiments , like epistasis analysis with ypt51ypt7 double mutants , will hopefully help to test this working hypothesis . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , 1994 296 While the internalization rate of transferrin can be modu - lated by rab5 in mammalian cells ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ) , it is at present still unclear why the deletion of YF / 51 , YP ~ 2 , and YF / 53 does not affect the internalization rate of a - factor in yeast . Morphological Changes in yptM , ypt52 , and ypt53 Mutants Analysis of the vacuolar morphology of the various ypt mu - tants using CDCFDA staining in living cells and light mi - croscopy revealed that the ypt51 mutant contained a single large vacuole , which was completely spherical , in contrast to the convoluted vacuolar structures observed in wild - type cells . In addition , vacuolar segregation structures were not found in ypt51 mutants . The single , spherical type of vacuole was also found predominately in the yptMypt52 , yptSlypt53 , and yptMypt52ypt53 mutants . However , in the latter mutants , a small but significant number of cells displayed fragmented vacuolar structures . The observation that these structures were also labeled with LY would favor an endosomal origin . Simultaneous disappearance of typical vacuolar elements in these particular cells would then support the idea that vacu - ole biogenesis depends on proper endocytic and vacuolar protein transport , as discussed before . Furthermore , the 40 - 60 - nm vesicles which accumulate in ypt51 and ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants , revealed by EM analy - sis , may correspond to transport intermediates of the endo - cytic and / or vacuolar protein sorting pathways . Their resem - blance in size to vesicles accumulating in mutants that are blocked in transport between the ER and the Golgi might be rather coincidental , since no such transport defect could be observed in the here described ypt mutants . Definite proof for the origin of these vesicular structures will await more detailed ultrastructural and cell fractionation analysis . The finding that morphological changes of the vacuolar system were not observed by EM , most likely can be explained by the fact that first , these changes might be only visible in liv - ing ceils , and second , that they are only apparent upon analy - sis of a large number of cells . Functional Redundance of YptMp , Ypt52p , and Ypt53p ? The existence of three similar Ypt proteins raises the ques - tion whether they might be functionally redundant or play specialized and distinct roles . Since in all respects the most severe defects were associated with the yptSI mutant com - pared to the other two single mutants , it seems that Ypt51p is the most essential protein for the general endocytic pathway . On the other hand , detectable aggravation of all analyzed phenotypes ( growth , endocytosis , vacuolar protein missort - ing , acidification , vacuolar morphology ) upon additional disruption of YP ' / ~ 2 and YF / ~ 3 demonstrates that the three gene products have at least overlapping functions . The role of Ypt53p in endocytic traffic ( or any other transport step ) is more elusive than that for YptSlp and Ypt52p . Its involve - ment in these transport pathways is , however , suggested in double yptMypt53 , ypt52ypt53 and the triple ypt51ypt52ypt53 mutants , in which synergistic effects can be observed . Never - theless , the sole presence of Ypt53p in ypt51ypt52 mutants does not complement the absence of the other two small GTPases , as no major phenotypic differences to the triple mutant could be detected . Therefore , it is possible that Ypt53p may have a very specialized , yet unresolved func - tion . Interestingly , the severity of the mutant phenotypes correlates well with the predicted abundance of the respec - tive proteins : Ypt5 lp and Ypt52p , which seem to be more im - portant for the general endocytic pathway , have a higher value of theoretical protein abundance , whereas the low abundance calculated for Ypt53p would be in agreement with a specialized and less general function .
