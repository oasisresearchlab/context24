Camesano * Department of Chemical Engineering , Worcester Polytechnic Institute , Worcester , Massachusetts Received 6 February 2004 / Accepted 15 June 2004 Microbial infections of medical implants occur in more than 2 million surgical cases each year in the United States alone . These increase patient morbidity and mortality , as well as patient cost and recovery time . Many treatments are available , but none are guaranteed to remove the infection . In many cases , the device infections are caused by the adhesion of microbes to the implant , ensuing growth , pathogenesis , and dissemination . The purpose of this work is to examine the initial events in microbial adhesion by simulating the approach and contact between a planktonic cell , immobilized on an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) cantilever , and a biomaterial or bioﬁlm substrate . The two model microbes used in this study , Candida parapsilosis ( ATCC 90018 ) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( ATCC 10145 ) , were chosen for both their clinical relevance and their ease of acquisition and handling in the laboratory setting . Attractive interactions exist between C . parapsilosis and both unmodiﬁed silicone rubber and P . aeruginosa bioﬁlms . Using C . parapsilosis cells immobilized on AFM cantilevers with a silicone substrate , we have measured attractive forces of 4 . 3 (cid:1) 0 . 25 nN in the approach portion of the force cycle . On P . aeruginosa bioﬁlms , the magnitude of the attractive force decreases to 2 . 0 (cid:1) 0 . 40 nN and is preceded by a 2 . 0 - nN repulsion at approximately 75 nm from the cell surface . These data suggest that C . parapsilosis may adhere to both silicone rubber and P . aeruginosa bioﬁlms , possibly contributing to patient morbidity and mortality . Characterization of cell - biomaterial and cell - cell interactions allows for a quantitative link between the physicomechanical and physicochemical properties of implant materials and the nanoscale interactions leading to microbial colonization and infection . The development of the microbial bioﬁlm and its impor - tance in medical implant infections have been thoroughly dis - cussed ( 13 , 40 ) . Causing over 2 million infections annually ( 22 ) , which generate over $ 11 billion in additional patient costs ( 36 ) , the bioﬁlm , in a biomedical context , is a system which demands attention . The application of atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to bio - logical systems seems advantageous and has been examined by a number of groups , beginning with early work on DNA ( 26 ) that was later extended to whole - cell systems . AFM was used to examine the physicochemical properties of microbial sur - faces ( 17 ) and to characterize lectin - carbohydrate interactions at the nanoscale ( 42 ) . AFM probes , functionalized with either biomaterial spheres or conﬂuent microbial lawns , were used to characterize bacterial - biomaterial interactions ( 34 , 35 ) . Single microbes , immobilized on AFM probes , have also been used to study a variety of surfaces . Bowen et al . ( 6 ) bound metabolically active Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the probe us - ing a chemical adhesive . Also , Benoit et al . ( 4 ) measured dis - crete intercellular interactions by using Dictyostelium discoi - deum attached to the probe via a lectin . We propose to extend these prior techniques by attaching viable , clinically relevant microbes to the AFM cantilever . These cell probes will then be used to measure local interaction forces between the immobi - lized cell and both biomaterial and bioﬁlm surfaces . Many infectious systems can be polymicrobial , each strain contributing to the whole in some signiﬁcant way ( 22 , 24 ) . Therefore , our model microbial system is designed to study the interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa , a bacterium re - sponsible for 99 % of bacteremia cases , keratitis , and infections in cystic ﬁbrosis patients ( 28 ) , and Candida parapsilosis , an emerging nosocomial pathogen isolated in infections of central venous catheters and bronchoscopes ( 27 , 31 ) . In our experi - ments , Candida cells are chemically immobilized onto AFM probes and used to quantify interactions with bare biomaterials and with biomaterials coated with a bacterial bioﬁlm . MATERIALS AND METHODS Microbial samples , storage , and growth . Freeze - dried samples of C . parapsi - losis ( ATCC 90018 ) and P . aeruginosa ( ATCC 10145 ) were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , Va . ) . C . parapsilosis was main - tained on Sabouraud dextrose agar ( Emmons’ modiﬁcation ; Sigma ) plates and grown in complete liquid medium ( 2 % [ wt / vol ] peptone , 1 % [ wt / vol ] yeast ex - tract , 2 % [ wt / vol ] glycerol [ Sigma ] ) . P . aeruginosa was maintained on tryptic soy agar ( Sigma ) plates and grown in tryptic soy broth ( Sigma ) . Cells were grown until mid - exponential growth phase in liquid medium ( optical density at 600 nm [ OD 600 ] (cid:1) 0 . 5 ) . Characterization of cell morphology , force interactions , and cantilever treat - ment . Cell cultures were examined with a Dimension 3100 atomic force micro - scope with a Nanoscope IIIa controller ( Digital Instruments , Santa Barbara , Calif . ) by using silicon nitride cantilevers ( DNPS ; Digital Instruments ; spring constants of 0 . 13 (cid:2) 0 . 02 N (cid:1) m (cid:3) 1 [ 11 ] or 0 . 25 (cid:2) 0 . 01 N (cid:1) m (cid:3) 1 [ 47 ] ) . Cantilevers were cleaned by exposure to UV light ( 5 min ) to remove adsorbed water and / or hydrocarbons . The unit was conﬁgured for intermittent contact mode in liquid per the manufacturer’s instructions . To attach cells , each slide was coated with 1 ml of poly - L - lysine and dried in a laminar ﬂow hood for 10 min . Cellular solutions were centrifuged ( 1 , 350 (cid:4) g , 15 min ) , washed with 0 . 1 M 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) buffer ( Aldrich ; pH 7 . 1 ) , vortexed , and poured over the dry glass slides in a petri dish . The covered petri dish was placed on a shaker table for 20 min to allow attach - ment . AFM images were captured for each cell found , and ﬁve force cycles per cell were recorded with drive amplitude set to zero ( approximating contact mode ) . * Corresponding author .

E - mail : terric @ wpi . edu . 6012 All force curves were recorded at approximately the same point on the cell , deﬁned as the highest point midway down the length of the cell ( 48 ) . For cell probe experiments , cantilevers were cleaned by placement under UV light ( 30 s ) . Cantilevers were further cleaned by sonication ( 1 min in double - distilled water and 1 min in reagent - grade ethanol [ Aldrich ] ) . To allow cell immobilization , 50 (cid:5) l of a 1 - hexadecanethiol ( HDT ) stock solution ( 10 mM in reagent - grade ethanol ) was placed on a polytetraﬂuoroethylene block , after which the cantilevers were placed into the droplet , removed , and allowed to dry . Cell probe preparation . Single C . parapsilosis cells were attached to AFM cantilevers by using a custom - designed triaxial micromanipulator with extension arm ( stages from Edmund Industrial Optics , Barrington , N . J . ) . A single silicon nitride chip , with two triangular cantilevers , was attached to the extension arm by using double - sided tape . Twenty - ﬁve microliters of Candida culture ( (cid:6) 10 11 cells (cid:1) ml (cid:3) 1 ) was pipetted to a channel of comparable volume etched into a polytet - raﬂuoroethylene block . The cantilever was oriented over the cell culture droplet such that both the tips on the cantilever and the droplet were visible under a stereoscope ( Eclipse SMZ - 10A ; Nikon ) and moved vertically downwards to the droplet until the tips were submerged . Tips were left for 5 min to allow cell adhesion to the HDT monolayer . The withdrawn cantilever was dried for 5 min in a laminar ﬂow hood and viewed with an optical microscope ( Eclipse E400 ; Nikon ) equipped with a UV ( (cid:7) (cid:8) 330 to 380 nm ) ﬁlter cube to verify attachment . Further , adhesion , number of cells adhered , and cell location were veriﬁed using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . The short , fat cantilever gave the best reproducibility for cell immobilization . SEM . Six cellular probes were viewed via SEM ( Amray 1610 Turbo ; Bedford , Mass . ) after dehydration and coating with gold . Each cantilever was examined at the tip , base , and legs ( magniﬁcation , (cid:4) 5 , 000 to (cid:4) 15 , 000 ) . Approach interactions at the cell - biomaterial interface . A 2 - cm 2 area of med - ical - grade silicone rubber tubing ( VWR ; 0 . 25 - in . inside diameter ) was cut and sliced axially and taped to the bottom half of a petri dish , to which MES buffer was added . Force cycles were recorded for 8 to 10 different areas with three data sets taken on each area . Silicone was examined with the Candida probe and with the unmodiﬁed probe and HDT - coated probe , the latter two serving as controls . Approach interactions at the cell - bioﬁlm interface . The parallel plate ﬂow cell ( BioSurface Technologies Corporation , Bozeman , Mont . ) was opened and cleaned , after which a coupon of silicone rubber was ﬁxed into the channel with double - sided tape . The ﬂow cell was assembled and sterilized according to the manufacturer’s instructions and mounted on a support brace in an orbital shaker bath ( Lab - Line ) at 37°C . Sixty milliliters of P . aeruginosa ( OD 600 (cid:9) 0 . 5 ) was centrifuged and resuspended in 0 . 1 M MES buffer and was then continuously pumped through the ﬂow cell at 380 cm (cid:1) min (cid:3) 1 ( Reynolds number , (cid:6) 200 ) . After bioﬁlms were allowed to form for 1 or 3 days in the ﬂow cell , the chamber was opened and the silicone was examined with AFM by using the Candida probe , the unmodiﬁed cantilever , and the HDT - coated cantilever . Electrophoretic mobility analysis . The electrophoretic mobilities and surface potentials of C . parapsilosis and P . aeruginosa were measured using a zeta po - tential analyzer ( Zeta PALS ; Brookhaven , Holtsville , N . Y . ) . Mid - exponential - growth - phase cultures were centrifuged ( 1 , 350 (cid:4) g ) and resuspended in MES buffer ( 25°C , pH 7 . 1 ) at several ionic strengths ( 0 . 02 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 06 , 0 . 08 , and 0 . 1 M ) and in deionized water ( (cid:6) 10 (cid:3) 6 M ) . All measurements were recorded four times and averaged . Zeta potentials reported by the software are automatically calculated accord - ing to the Smoluchowski equation ( 45 ) . Since recent work has shown that this formulation overestimates surface potentials for soft materials , such as bacteria ( 23 , 30 ) , we also applied the soft - particle DLVO ( Derjaguin - Landau - Vervey - Overbeek ) theory of Ohshima et al . ( 23 , 30 ) . A thorough description of the application of these models to our system may be found elsewhere ( 19 ) . Interaction energy calculations . Advancing contact angles were recorded for each microbe under water , formamide , and diiodomethane , by using a Rame - Hart NRL contact angle goniometer ( model 100 ; Mountain Lakes , N . J . ) with 80 readings taken on both sides of each liquid droplet and averaged . The Hamaker constants were obtained from the microbial apolar surface free energy , by using the van Oss - Chaudhury - Good equation ( 44 – 46 ) . We calculate the interaction energy as a function of particle separation according to the two DLVO theories , which can demonstrate London - van der Waals and electrostatic interactions . Modeling of steric interactions with the microbial polymer brush . A steric model of the total force experienced by two interacting surfaces , one covered with grafted polymers and the other bare , was developed to describe the total force ( F st ) due to steric interactions of an AFM probe with a polymer brush ( 3 , 10 , 14 ) : F st (cid:1) 50 k B TaL 0 (cid:10) 3 / 2 e (cid:3) 2 (cid:11) h / L 0 ( 1 ) where k B is the Boltzmann constant , L 0 is the equilibrium polymer brush length , h is the distance between the probe and the sample , T is absolute temperature , a is tip radius of curvature , and (cid:10) is grafted polymer density . While the probe has a nominal radius of curvature of 40 (cid:2) 20 nm , its behavior in terms of long - range interaction energies ( van der Waals , electrostatic , etc . ) is that of a much larger ( 130 - to 380 - nm ) sphere ( 15 , 37 ) . For a similar microbial system , a larger radius ( 250 nm ) was appropriate for the modeling of steric interactions ( 11 ) , and so 250 nm was used in this study . By using nonlinear regression software , the model was ﬁtted to the approach curves . RESULTS Characterization of cell morphologies and force interac - tions . P . aeruginosa cells are rod shaped ( 2 to 3 (cid:5) m by 800 nm ; images not shown ) . Measurements of the forces between the unmodiﬁed silicon nitride probe and individual cells of P . aeruginosa during the approach of the probe to the cell show interactions beginning at 70 nm from the cell surface ( Fig . 1 ) . Only repulsive interactions exist for this cell during the ap - proach portions of the force cycle , which reach a maximum value of 6 (cid:2) 1 nN at the point of zero separation . C . parapsilosis cells are spherical ( diameters , 4 to 6 (cid:5) m ; images not shown ) . The interactions between an unmodiﬁed silicon nitride probe and individual cells of C . parapsilosis are attractive , reaching 0 . 9 (cid:2) 0 . 16 nN approximately 55 nm from the origin ( Fig . 2A ) . This is in contrast with the ﬁndings of Bowen et al . ( 6 ) , who showed no attractive behavior in the approach interactions of S . cerevisiae probes on mica . Differ - ences in experimental conditions ( e . g . , substrate , pH , and mi - crobe surface polymers ) could explain the differences between these data sets . High - force physical agitation of the cells ( viz . , the centrifu - gation and vortexing steps used to prepare cells ) may be a concern , as this agitation could dislodge cell surface structures . Pembrey et al . ( 32 ) have shown , however , that cell surface properties ( e . g . , electrophoretic mobility , structural integrity , and viability ) are not signiﬁcantly altered by agitation at or below 5 , 000 (cid:4) g . The centrifugation and vortexing protocols utilized in these experiments do not exert a force of (cid:12) 1 , 350 (cid:4) g on the cells . Therefore , we do not expect cell surface prop - erties to be altered by our protocols . Interpretation of the distance of these interactions is a dif - ﬁcult and important issue , since several methods exist to deﬁne the cell surface . For example , the data in Fig . 2A were cali - brated according to the method proposed by Ducker and Senden ( 16 ) , in which the constant compliance region of the curve is aligned with the force axis . An alternate approach , following contact mechanical methods ( 8 , 9 ) , deﬁnes the sam - ple surface as the minimum point of the attraction , where all forces acting on the cantilever sum to zero ( Fig . 2B ) . Neither method , however , explicitly accounts for the extracellular poly - mer layer expected for a microbial sample . Such interpretation issues of attractive interactions in approach curves are dis - cussed below . Cell probe preparation and SEM analysis . After prepara - tion of the cellular probes , we veriﬁed adhesion and placement of the cells on the cantilevers by SEM . Approach interactions at the cell - biomaterial interface . The interactions between silicone rubber and the cellular modiﬁed probe are attractive ( Fig . 3 ) , beginning at 120 nm from the cell surface with a magnitude of 2 . 3 (cid:2) 0 . 25 nN at a range of 78 nm . V OL . 70 , 2004 PATHOGENIC MICROBIAL ADHESION TO A BIOMATERIAL 6013 Both the magnitude and the range of these attractions are larger than those for bare and HDT - modiﬁed control cantile - vers . If we directly apply the method of Ducker and Senden , then a strong steric repulsion occurs ( Fig . 3A ) , beginning at (cid:6) 50 nm from the cell surface and reaching a magnitude of (cid:6) 35 nN at the silicone rubber surface . Contact mechanical analysis ( Fig . 3B ) eliminates this repulsive interaction , showing a total range of the attraction as (cid:6) 40 nm . Approach interactions at the cell - bioﬁlm interface . For a representative 3 - day bioﬁlm , AFM approach curves of a mod - iﬁed Candida probe examining the P . aeruginosa bioﬁlm show both attractive and repulsive regions ( Fig . 4 ) . By the Ducker and Senden method of determining the origin of the force cycles ( Fig . 4A ) , interactions begin at (cid:6) 250 nm from the bio - ﬁlm surface , initially showing repulsion that reaches a maxi - mum of 1 . 7 nN at 165 nm . At a range of (cid:6) 115 nm , there is an attractive interaction with a magnitude of 3 . 7 (cid:2) 0 . 64 nN . By use of the contact mechanical models , the surface repulsion is again ignored , and the total interaction range is truncated to 130 nm ( Fig . 4B ) . Data were identical for bioﬁlm growth ex - periments lasting 1 and 3 days in the parallel plate ﬂow cham - ber , suggesting that adhesion and detachment of bacteria to the surface reach a steady state relatively quickly . Electrophoretic mobility analysis . Over the range of ionic strengths , the zeta potential for P . aeruginosa increases from (cid:3) 8 . 0 mV at 20 mM to (cid:3) 3 . 4 mV at 100 mM ( Table 1 ) . We see more variation as a function of ionic strength among the data for C . parapsilosis ( (cid:3) 6 . 3 to (cid:3) 3 . 4 mV ) . As expected , for both microbes , lower values for zeta potentials are calculated by using soft - particle theory than by using the zeta potential as the surface potential via the Smoluchowski equation . The excep - tion is at low ionic strengths , where soft - particle DLVO theory is least able to represent experimental results . Interaction energy calculations . By using two polar liquids ( water and formamide ) and one nonpolar liquid ( diiodometh - ane ) , contact angles on microbial lawns may be translated into surface free energy components . Both microbes are relatively hydrophilic , but C . parapsilosis ( (cid:13) W (cid:8) 15 . 17 (cid:2) 11 . 5° [ standard FIG . 1 . P . aeruginosa approach curves with unmodiﬁed silicon nitride probe . Data shown represent three measurements on a single cell . Interactions begin at (cid:6) 70 nm from the cell surface and are purely repulsive in nature . Repulsion at zero separation distance reaches a value of 7 . 0 (cid:2) 1 . 4 nN . The inset ﬁgure demonstrates the two slopes seen when plotting the natural logarithm of the force data versus separation . This behavior suggests that the cantilever is detecting two separate polymer brushes grafted to the cell surface . 6014 EMERSON AND CAMESANO A PPL . E NVIRON . M ICROBIOL . deviation ( SD ) ] ) is more hydrophilic than P . aeruginosa ( (cid:13) W (cid:8) 24 . 42 (cid:2) 1 . 5° [ SD ] ) ( Table 2 ) . These values , and the corre - sponding surface free energy components , differ signiﬁcantly from published values for P . aeruginosa Olin ( 21 ) and C . parap - silosis strains 294 and 289 ( 20 ) , but such differences could be related to different culture or environmental conditions . Poort - inga et al . ( 33 ) showed that DLVO theory in biological systems may be modiﬁed by modeling the cell surface as a soft , ion - penetrable particle . The models , however , would be speciﬁc to each microbial strain examined , since the interactions pre - dicted by DLVO theory are more complex in a biological system . Simultaneous solution of three instances of the van Oss - Chaudhury - Good equation ( 45 ) yields the three surface ten - FIG . 2 . C . parapsilosis approach curves with unmodiﬁed silicon nitride probe . Data shown represent three measurements on a single cell . Based on the method of Ducker and Senden ( 16 ) , the curves appear as in panel A , with the constant compliance region aligned with the vertical axis . However , according to contact mechanics ( 9 ) , we may also deﬁne the minimum of the attractive force , viz . , where all force gradients acting on the cantilever sum to zero , as the cell surface ( B ) . Whether either method accurately describes the polymer layer on the surface has yet to be determined . V OL . 70 , 2004 PATHOGENIC MICROBIAL ADHESION TO A BIOMATERIAL 6015 sion components ( Table 2 ) . The values of the apolar surface tension component are then used to calculate the Hamaker constants ( 45 ) , which have values of ( 6 . 71 (cid:2) 0 . 12 ) (cid:4) 10 (cid:3) 20 J ( SD ) for C . parapsilosis and ( 5 . 12 (cid:2) 0 . 03 ) (cid:4) 10 (cid:3) 20 J ( SD ) for P . aeruginosa . Values for the two strains are in good agreement ( (cid:14) 10 (cid:3) 21 - J variation ) with reported values of similar strains ( 20 , 21 ) . Interaction energy proﬁles for the interaction of each mi - crobe with silicon nitride were calculated ( Fig . 5 ) . C . parapsi - losis shows no energy barrier preventing adhesion by soft - particle DLVO theory but rather an attractive energy of 5 . 86 k B T . An electrostatic repulsion of 18 . 4 k B T , starting at 0 . 3 nm , exists in the calculation based on the rigid - particle calculation . P . aeruginosa shows a 4 . 83 - k B T electrostatic repulsion at 0 . 1 nm by the rigid - particle model , while at the same distance this repulsion has a magnitude of 7 . 00 k B T by the soft - particle FIG . 3 .

Panel A shows the data analyzed according to the Ducker and Senden method ( 16 ) , while panel B was analyzed by contact mechanics ( 9 ) . The modiﬁed probe has the strongest interactions with the cell - modiﬁed probes and the weakest interactions with the HDT - modiﬁed probes . Note that the different data analysis techniques do not change the interaction for a bare probe on silicone rubber . 6016 EMERSON AND CAMESANO A PPL . E NVIRON . M ICROBIOL . model . For both microbes , these small repulsions are greatly outweighed by van der Waals attractive interactions at very small separation distances . Neither classical nor soft - particle DLVO theory agrees with the behavior seen in AFM force curves ( Fig . 1 and 2 ) . Also , the closeness of the predictions based on the two models indicates that the ion penetrability of the sample is unimportant in the overall interaction . As such , the behavior shown in the force curves must be due to addi - tional physicochemical or physicomechanical phenomena . Modeling of steric interactions with the cellular polymer brush . The approach curves were ﬁtted using the polymer scaling model , with the grafted polymer density and equilib - rium polymer length as ﬁtting parameters . Steric interactions are relevant only in systems that show repulsive interactions . FIG . 4 . Approach curves with a C . parapsilosis - modiﬁed probe in examining a bacterial bioﬁlm grown for 3 days . Panel A shows the data analyzed according to the Ducker and Senden method ( 16 ) , while panel B was analyzed by contact mechanics ( 9 ) . A repulsive interaction begins at (cid:6) 250 nm from the cell surface . Repulsions are followed by attractive events , which reach magnitudes of 3 . 7 (cid:2) 0 . 64 nN at (cid:6) 115 nm . V OL . 70 , 2004 PATHOGENIC MICROBIAL ADHESION TO A BIOMATERIAL 6017 When force curves are analyzed according to the method of Ducker and Senden , the steric model is applicable to all sys - tems . The steric model was in good agreement with experimental data ( Table 3 ) , except for the silicone rubber - DNPS tip system . Since no polymer brush is present on this surface , it was nec - essary to process the data according to contact mechanical models , viz . , aligning the minimum of the attractive interaction with the point of zero separation . We noted that , for P . aeruginosa , although steric model ﬁts agreed acceptably with the collected data ( data not shown ) , the model failed to ﬁt the data points at separation distances of (cid:6) 20 nm from the surface . When the data were plotted as the natural logarithm of the force versus the separation distance ( Fig . 1 , inset ) , an inﬂection point could be seen at the distance where the steric model fails to ﬁt the data well . As such , we formulated an extension to the steric model which accounts for two polymer layers , each having a different grafting density and equilibrium polymer brush length . This is represented mathe - matically by changing the term L 0 (cid:10) 3 / 2 e (cid:3) 2 (cid:11) h / L 0 in equation 1 to L 1 (cid:10) 13 / 2 e (cid:3) 2 (cid:11) h / L 1 (cid:1) L 2 (cid:10) 23 / 2 e (cid:3) 2 (cid:11) h / L 2 . Fitting parameters for this extended model may be seen in Table 3 . Modeling the cell as a cylinder with a 1 - (cid:5) m radius and two hemispherical end caps with 1 - (cid:5) m radii , the grafting densities for P . aeruginosa are 7 . 86 (cid:4) 10 4 and 3 . 96 (cid:4) 10 5 polymers (cid:1) cell (cid:3) 1 for the long and short polymers , respectively . DISCUSSION Interpretation of AFM force curves . AFM force curves may be interpreted in several ways , depending upon the reference points used to deﬁne the sample surface and baseline interac - tion force . For example , Ducker and Senden ( 16 ) align deﬂec - tion data with the axes of a Cartesian plane , with the assump - tion that the cantilever is signiﬁcantly more compliant than the sample surface , with the use of two regions of the curve as reference points . The linear constant compliance region is aligned with the vertical force axis , while the zero interaction region is aligned with the horizontal separation axis . Contact mechanical models , such as those presented in reference 9 , deﬁne the reference points mathematically . These different models are discussed more thoroughly elsewhere ( 19 ) . Analy - sis of the constant compliance regions recorded in this study ( data not shown ) shows that they agree within 5 % with those recorded for glass by using cantilevers of comparable stiffness . This justiﬁes the assumption that the cantilever is signiﬁcantly more compliant than the substrate and validates our use of the Ducker method of force curve analysis . Approach curves shown in Fig . 2 illustrate the differences between the Ducker and Senden method and a contact me - chanical model deﬁning the surface as the attractive minimum , respectively , for C . parapsilosis probed with an unmodiﬁed DNPS tip . The contact mechanical model employed requires that the surface be at this minimum and ignores the shape of the force curve . For many probe - sample combinations , this is a logical treatment , since the constant compliance region begins directly after the attractive minimum ( Fig . 3 , inset ) , and all cantilever deﬂection is due to scanner motion . However , for many systems , especially those involving polymer brushes , ap - plication of these models suggests signiﬁcant indentation into the cell wall . This negates the primary assumption that the cantilever is more compliant than the sample surface . It is therefore our argument that , since the constant com - pliance region is used as the reference point in all systems not involving polymer brushes ( 9 , 16 ) , the same reference should be used for those with polymer brushes , enabling comparison between disparate systems . Data in this paper have been re - ported according to this latter method , and data treated ac - cording to the contact mechanical model are shown for com - parison . Cell probe preparation and SEM analysis . The present im - mobilization technique was developed to minimize the area of the cell that would be chemically treated , thus reducing arti - facts due to chemical treatments .

Examination of the Candida cellular probes with SEM showed cells bound to the cantilever with multiple cells present in some cases . In each case , however , only single cells were present near the cantilever tip and available to interact with the sample surface . Since the height of the tips is small ( (cid:6) 1 (cid:5) m ) relative to the height of the cells , the chemisorbed Candida cells are the major bodies interacting with the sample surfaces . It was also noted that , while the cells were not perfectly aligned at the apex of each cantilever , the tips themselves were , in all cases , off center . Any changes in force curves due to this misalignment of the tip are corrected for when deﬁning the coordinate system . The same technique should be directly applicable to correcting for an off - center cell chemi - sorbed to the cantilever . Approach interactions at the cell - biomaterial interface . For a C . parapsilosis - modiﬁed probe interacting with silicone rub - FIG . 5 . Interaction energies for C . parapsilosis ( A ) and P . aeruginosa ( B ) in 100 mM MES buffer . Shown are total energy and the individual contributions for van der Waals and electrostatic interactions , with the differences between soft - particle ( points ) and rigid - particle ( lines ) DLVO theories . The two show nearly identical results , save for small differences in electrostatic interactions at very short ( (cid:14) 4 - nm ) separation distances . V OL . 70 , 2004 PATHOGENIC MICROBIAL ADHESION TO A BIOMATERIAL 6019 ber , strong adhesive interactions exist . It is possible that irreg - ularities in the silicone surface may account for the variation in attraction magnitude , causing microbial surface structures to interact with different regions of the material surface . There is little variation in the distance over which the attractions occur , however , which reinforces SEM results of single cells interact - ing with the substrate . The role of such structures in lectin - ligand binding to speciﬁc sites has been investigated by a num - ber of groups ( 39 , 42 ) . While no speciﬁc structures have been identiﬁed for C . parapsilosis , various other yeasts ( Kluyveromy - ces bulgaricus [ 18 ] , S . cerevisiae [ 12 ] , and Candida albicans [ 38 ] ) produce them . Retraction curves for the various systems were also analyzed ( data not shown ) . For each system , adhesive events occurred and may be qualitatively correlated to the systems by their magnitude and distance from the surface . Also , we saw no variation with time or number of measurements in approach curves , suggesting that none of the cell surface molecules in - volved in the interaction are lost by adhesion to the substrate . Further information may be found in reference 19 . Approach interactions at the cell - bioﬁlm interface . Interac - tions between a modiﬁed probe and a nascent P . aeruginosa bioﬁlm also exhibit attraction on approach . Immediately be - fore this attraction occurs , long - range ( (cid:6) 250 - nm ) repulsion occurs , reaching a maximum at (cid:6) 175 nm from the bioﬁlm surface . This can be attributed to a combination of electro - static double - layer effects associated with the polymer brushes on each microbe , as well as steric effects . Indeed , ﬁtting this data with a single - polymer steric model yields an equilibrium polymer brush length of (cid:6) 175 nm and a grafting density of 9 . 7 (cid:4) 10 17 polymers (cid:1) m (cid:3) 2 . There is little variation in the distance over which the attractions occur , suggesting that the probe experiences an “average” interaction with a substrate expected to be topographically heterogeneous . As the Candida - modiﬁed probe moves closer to the surface , strong attractive interactions begin to dominate . This suggests that an initial energy barrier must be overcome to reach an energetic minimum favoring adhesion . Therefore , the plank - tonic microbe must have sufﬁcient force , associated with bulk ﬂow , gravitational settling , or inherent mobility , to initially bind to a bioﬁlm . The attractions are also of much higher ( as much as 3 (cid:4) greater ) magnitude than those seen for a modiﬁed probe - bare biomaterial system , indicating that planktonic cells have a higher afﬁnity for binding to surfaces on which a bioﬁlm is already growing . Microbial interaction energy analyses . Microbial surface po - tentials were calculated using classical and soft - particle DLVO theories , with DLVO calculations based on the rigid - particle model showing higher values for surface potential than poten - tials calculated from the soft - particle equations . For C . parap - silosis ( Fig . 5A ) , there was poor agreement with soft - particle DLVO theory , in terms of calculating the surface potential for the cell . Plotting calculated versus experimental electro - phoretic mobilities ( data not shown ) , followed by a linear re - gression of these data , gave a value of R 2 (cid:8) 0 . 22 and a spatial charge density ( ZN ) of (cid:3) 0 . 0196 mol (cid:1) liter (cid:3) 1 . Fungal cell walls often contain cellulose , chitin , or both ( 29 ) , which greatly in - crease cell wall rigidity . So , while the potentials of various bacterial strains , such as those of Escherichia coli ( 2 ) , Pseudo - monas putida ( 1 ) , P . aeruginosa ( reference 23 and this study ) ( Fig . 5B ) , and Streptococcus salivarius ( 5 ) , can be better de - scribed with soft - particle DLVO theory , C . parapsilosis would presumably interact as a more rigid particle . Vadillo - Rodriguez et al . ( 43 ) have begun a series of relevant studies , utilizing AFM to determine relationships between macroscopic cell properties ( ﬂuid contact angles , electro - phoretic mobility , etc . ) and microscopic - nanoscopic cell prop - erties ( double - layer interactions , hydrogen bonding , etc . ) . Ini - tial results from this work seem promising , and future work by this and other groups will hopefully lead to quantitative rela - tions between macroscopic and microscopic - nanoscopic cell properties . Modeling of steric interactions with the microbial polymer brush . In most of the biological systems that we examined , for either microbe individually or for the cell - cell interactions , steric repulsions of varying magnitude were observed in ap - proach curves . Applying the single - brush steric model to these repulsions , we see the role of the microbial exopolymers in the force - distance interactions . The model predicts grafting densi - ties 1 order of magnitude higher for the interactions between the C . parapsilosis probe and the P . aeruginosa bioﬁlm than for the interactions between C . parapsilosis and glass . Values of the equilibrium polymer brush length , however , remain com - parable . The two - brush steric model ﬁts the repulsive regions of the approach curves for P . aeruginosa very well ( R 2 (cid:12) 0 . 99 ) , indi - cating that steric forces , attributable to two separate types of polymer brushes , play a signiﬁcant role as the probe ap - proaches the cells ( Fig . 1 ) . We believe that a two - brush model is valid based on the presence of an inﬂection point at (cid:6) 20 nm from the sample surface ( Fig . 1 , inset ) . The two separate slopes suggest that the probe is interacting with polymer samples having disparate mechanical properties ( viz . , rigidity and elas - ticity ) . P . aeruginosa is known to produce a variety of polymeric materials in both its planktonic and sessile states , including type IV pili ( 41 ) , alginate ( 7 ) , lipopolysaccharides ( 25 ) , and possibly a variety of others . Given this assortment of secreted materials , it is likely that their presence is detectable by the AFM cantilever , especially if the cantilever is very compliant . In actuality , we likely have more than two types of polymers present . However , they can be grouped into two populations TABLE 3 .

There were no attractive interactions seen during the ap - proach of the silicon nitride tip with P . aeruginosa . Qualita - tively similar results have been observed from AFM measure - ments on E . coli JM109 ( 2 ) , Burkholderia cepacia G4 , and P . putida KT2442 ( 11 ) . The hydrophobicity and surface potentials of P . putida and P . aeruginosa are similar , and it is not surpris - ing that strong repulsive interactions are observed between the polymer brush and the AFM probe for both bacterial strains . Conclusions . We examined two medically important mi - crobes in order to characterize their afﬁnity for biomaterial and bioﬁlm surfaces . Although steric interactions play signiﬁcant roles in the approach of silicon nitride probes to P . aeruginosa , they cannot explain the adhesive interactions seen in C . parap - silosis systems . Further , such adhesions are not explainable via soft - or rigid - particle DLVO analyses . C . parapsilosis shows attractive interactions with bare and P . aeruginosa bioﬁlm - coated silicone rubber . The bioﬁlm systems show interactions beginning at distances more than twice that of bare silicone rubber , with similar attractive magnitudes . Further , bioﬁlms demonstrate an initial repulsive force that is a combination of electrostatic and steric interactions between the polymer brushes of cell probe and the ﬁlm . We have also demonstrated that established methods of force curve analysis show inconsistencies for systems involving a polymer brush on either the substrate or the probe . Addi - tional experimentation is necessary to accurately quantify the role of the polymer brush in AFM approach curves involving attraction . In this case , the point of zero separation was de - ﬁned according to the method of Ducker and Senden , in which the constant compliance region is aligned with the vertical axis . This does not truly represent contact with the cell wall , as the polymer brush must take up some space , but instead represents a vertical offset including the maximum compressible thickness of the brush at the point of constant compliance . By using our model system and techniques , cell - biomaterial and cell - cell interactions are characterized at the scales of force and distance at which they occur .
