Specific MABC clones are reportedly spreading globally in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients , 41 however , associated genomic epidemiology studies are lacking in East Asia . Analysis of whole - 42 genome sequencing data for MABC isolates from 220 pre - treatment , non - CF patients in Japan 43 and Taiwan revealed that 112 / 220 , 105 / 220 , and 3 / 220 were M . abscessus subsp . abscessus 44 ( ABS ) , M . abscessus subsp . massiliense ( MAS ) , and M . abscessus subsp . bolletii ( BOL ) , 45 respectively . No significant differences in subspecies composition were noted based on location . 46 Moreover , > 50 % of ABS and > 70 % of MAS were related to four predominant clones in the 47 region . Known mutations conferring acquired macrolide resistance were rare ( 1 . 4 % ) and not 48 enriched in the predominant clones . Conversely , the macrolide - susceptible erm ( 41 ) T28C 49 mutation was significantly enriched in one predominant ABS clone . The most predominant 50 ABS clone was genetically related to the dominant circulating clone ( DCC ) . Hence , we have 51 clarified the relationship between the predominant clones in Japan and Taiwan , and those 52 reported in the international CF patient community . Our results provide insights regarding the 53 genetic characteristics of globally dominant and area - specific strains isolated from patients with 54 or without CF , as well as differences between globally spread and regionally - specific strains . 55 .

As of August 58 2021 , a total of 194 species have been officially registered in the genus Mycobacterium with 59 valid nomenclature ( 1 ) , many of which cause diseases in mammals , including humans . NTM 60 ubiquitously exists in the environment , including water , soil , plants , and animals . Although the 61 global incidence of tuberculosis has declined gradually , pulmonary infectious diseases caused 62 by NTM are globally emerging and frequently intractable due , in part , to their intrinsic 63 resistance to many antibiotics ( 2 ) . The Mycobacterium abscessus complex ( MABC ) account 64 for a group of frequently isolated opportunistic pathogens in patients with or without host risk 65 factors , such as cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , bronchiectasis , and other immunocompromised statuses 66 ( 3 – 5 ) . The occurrence of pulmonary MABC infection has long been investigated , particularly 67 among CF patients , primarily throughout Europe and the Americas ( 3 , 6 , 7 ) , and has also been 68 reported among non - CF patients in some Asian countries , including Japan , South Korea , and 69 Taiwan ( 8 – 12 ) . 70 The MABC is a triad of rapidly growing NTM comprising M . abscessus subsp . abscessus 71 ( ABS ) , M . abscessus subsp . bolletii ( BOL ) , and M . abscessus subsp . massiliense ( MAS ) ( 13 ) . 72 The clinical differences among the subspecies regarding the incidence , manifestation , and 73 prognosis are gradually being elucidated and reflect the clinical importance of differences in 74 .

With recent advances in whole - genome sequencing ( WGS ) technologies , 75 a series of epidemiological studies on MABC isolates have been conducted at different scales , 76 including outbreaks within a single hospital ( 16 , 17 ) , nationwide ( 18 , 19 ) , and even those spread 77 intercontinentally ( 20 , 21 ) . Using WGS data of geographically diverse MABC isolated from 78 patients with CF , Bryant et al . revealed that most isolates form dense clusters with low genetic 79 diversity , and three dominantly circulating clones ( DCCs ) were identified , namely , two ABS 80 clones ( DCC1 and DCC2 ) and one MAS clone ( DCC3 ) ( 20 ) . Subsequent epidemiological 81 studies using WGS at CF centers in other cohorts confirmed the presence of ABS and MAS 82 clones widely distributed among the patients studied ( 19 , 22 ) , however , it is unclear whether 83 these findings apply to MABC isolated from non - CF patients and whether these DCCs are also 84 prevalent in East Asian countries , where few patients are diagnosed with CF ( 23 , 24 ) . 85 Each subspecies exhibits different susceptibility to macrolides , one of the key antibiotics 86 in the treatment of MABC infections . Of the three subspecies of MABC , nearly all MASs are 87 susceptible to macrolides due to the presence of the truncated unfunctional erythromycin 88 ribosomal methylase ( erm ) ( 41 ) gene ( 25 , 26 ) . The remaining two subspecies with the functional 89 erm ( 41 ) gene induce macrolide resistance via methylation of the target molecule , however , 90 become macrolide - susceptible when the erm ( 41 ) gene loses its function through T to C 91 substitution at position 28 ( 27 , 28 ) . In addition to intrinsic macrolide resistance , MABC can 92 acquire mutational macrolide resistance through substitutions on the rrl gene encoding the 23S 93 .

Since these mutations likely impact long - term treatment and promote poor 94 outcomes of MABC infection compared to other NTM diseases ( 31 ) , detailed epidemiological 95 analyses of macrolide resistance - associated mutations are required to control MABC infection . 96 However , the incidence of these mutations in MABC populations derived from non - CF 97 untreated patients in Asian countries , as well as the relationship between these mutations and 98 the predominant clones , are poorly understood . 99 In this study , we sequenced the genomes of 220 MABC clinical isolates , all of which were 100 obtained from non - CF patients before treatment in four hospitals in three East Asian locations 101 ( Tokyo , Okinawa , and Taiwan ) covering subtropical to temperate climate zones over five years . 102 Using the data set , we examined subspecies distribution , the incidence of macrolide resistance - 103 associated mutations , as well as prevalent clones and their genetic features to determine the 104 epidemiological distribution of MABC in Japan and Taiwan . 105 106 Results 107 Isolation of MABC subspecies in Japan and Taiwan 108 We first identified subspecies of 220 MABC clinical isolates based on WGS data to 109 examine the subspecies distribution in Japan and Taiwan . In a maximum - likelihood 110 phylogenetic tree , isolates were divided into three major clades corresponding to each of the 111 three subspecies of MABC ( Fig . 1 ) . This result was confirmed by calculating the average 112 .

The minimum ANI among MABC 113 clinical isolates was 96 . 4 % , all ANI values within the three subspecies were > 98 % ( minimum : 114 98 . 1 % ) , while all ANI values between subspecies were < 98 % ( maximum : 97 . 6 % ; Fig . S1 ) . 115 This indicates that the species and subspecies boundaries of the MABC clinical isolates were 116 approximately 96 % and 98 % ANI , respectively , which is consistent with previous results ( 15 ) . 117 Of the 220 isolates , 112 ( 50 . 9 % ) , 105 ( 47 . 7 % ) , and 3 ( 1 . 4 % ) were identified as ABS , MAS , 118 and BOL , respectively ( Fig . 1 ) . We detected no significant difference between the composition 119 of MABC subspecies in Tokyo , Okinawa , and Taiwan ( Fig . 1 , Wald test ) . 120 121 Prevalent clones of ABS and MAS in Japan and Taiwan . 122 To investigate the genetic relatedness of isolates from individual patients in Japan and 123 Taiwan , we analyzed the phylogeny of ABS and MAS separately ( Fig . 2 , Fig . 3 ) . Among the 124 112 ABS isolates , we identified six clusters ( ABS - EA1 to ABS - EA6 , shown in Fig . 2 ) , 125 including 85 isolates ( 75 . 9 % ) . Of these isolates , 37 ( 33 . 0 % ) and 25 ( 22 . 3 % ) from the three 126 locations belonged to the largest clusters ( ABS - EA1 and ABS - EA2 , respectively ) ( Fig . 2 ) . The 127 other three ABS - EA clusters ( ABS - EA3 , 5 , and 6 ) consisted of isolates from two different sites 128 ( Tokyo / Okinawa , Tokyo / Taipei , or Taipei / Okinawa ) . We identified five clusters of 105 MAS 129 isolates , including 87 isolates ( 82 . 9 % ) ( MAS - EA1 to MAS - EA5 , shown in Fig . 3 ) . Of these 130 clustered isolates , 51 ( 48 . 6 % ) and 20 ( 19 . 0 % ) from the three locations belonged to the first 131 .

We also examined the 133 population differences between ABS and MAS in this region . The genome - wide nucleotide 134 diversity of MAS was significantly higher than that of ABS ( Fig . S2A , p < 5 . 1e - 06 , two - sided 135 Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) , and the total number of genes within MAS isolates was larger than 136 that of the ABS isolates ( Fig . S2B ) , whereas the pairwise genetic distances between isolates 137 within each of the MAS - EA clusters were significantly lower than those of the ABS - EA clusters 138 ( Fig . S2C , p < 2 . 2e - 16 , two - sided Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) . 139 140 Mutations associated with macrolide resistance of ABS / MAS in Japan and Taiwan ( East Asia , 141 EA ) 142 Since macrolides , such as clarithromycin and azithromycin , are first - line antibiotics for 143 the treatment of MABC infection , it is important to determine the incidence of genetic 144 mutations associated with macrolide susceptibility in the presence of circulating clones in Japan 145 and Taiwan . We found that no ABS isolates harbored mutations in the rrl hotspot ( 2269 to 2271 146 bp in the rrl gene of ATCC19977 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Among the 112 ABS , 24 ( 21 . 4 % ) carried the 147 erm ( 41 ) T28C sequence variant . Notably , all erm ( 41 ) T28C sequences belonged to the ABS - 148 EA2 and exhibited significant enrichment in this clade ( Fig . 2 , p < 2 . 2e - 16 , Fisher ' s exact test ) . 149 Three of the 105 MAS ( 2 . 9 % ) had substitutions in the hotspot on the rrl gene , all of which 150 .

However , two MAS ( TWN - 024 and TWN - 041 ) displayed a full - length 153 erm ( 41 ) gene , with a simultaneous T28C substitution . A total of 102 MAS isolates ( 97 . 1 % ) 154 were predicted to be susceptible to macrolides . Together with the fact that no BOL ( n = 3 ) 155 displayed substitutions in the rrl hotspot or T28C mutation in the erm ( 41 ) gene ( data not shown ) , 156 126 / 220 MABC isolates ( 57 . 3 % , 24 ABS and 102 MAS ) were predicted to be susceptible to 157 macrolides due to dysfunctional erm ( 41 ) , whereas 91 isolates ( 41 . 4 % , 88 ABS and 3 BOL ) may 158 induce macrolide resistance , and the remaining three isolates ( 1 . 4 % ) carried mutations that have 159 been reported to confer macrolide resistance . 160 161 The relationship between ABS prevalent in Japan and Taiwan and previously described 162 prevalent clones worldwide 163 We next investigated the relationships between prevalent clones in Japan and Taiwan and 164 previously described DCCs . Publicly available raw sequence data for 349 ABS from individual 165 CF patients in seven countries ( one isolate per patient , all additional isolates are listed in Table 166 S3 ) ( 20 ) were combined with our data set . In the ABS population , we identified 16 clusters 167 ( ABS - GL1 to ABS - GL16 shown in Fig . 4 ) , of which 11 ( ABS - GL1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 168 and 16 ) consisted of isolates from more than two regions ( Fig . 4 ) . Two clusters ( ABS - GL10 169 .

All ABS isolates belonging to ABS - EA1 171 were clustered with isolates that were identified as DCC1 ( = Absc1 ) within the global CF patient 172 community ( 20 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . Although all ABS belonging to DCC2 ( = Absc2 ) ( 20 ) were clustered 173 in ABS - GL2 , no isolate from Japan and Taiwan belonged to this cluster ( Fig . 4 ) . We also found 174 that all isolates belonging to ABS - EA2 clustered in ABS - GL3 with several Absc clusters . 175 Notably , 97 out of 114 isolates ( 85 . 1 % ) belonged to the clade carrying T28C in the erm ( 41 ) 176 gene , whereas the remaining 17 isolates did not ( Fig . 4 ) . Although isolates belonging to this 177 clade exclusively displayed the substitution , it appeared that isolates of several sub - clades 178 within ABS - GL2 reversed to the wild - type T28 genotype in the erm ( 41 ) gene ( Fig . 5A , Fig . 179 S3 ) . To explore the mode of reacquisition of the T28 genotype , we examined the mutation 180 pattern of the erm ( 41 ) gene in all ABS clinical isolates ( Fig . 5 , Fig . S3 ) . We found that the 181 ancestral form of erm ( 41 ) in clinical isolates belonging to the ABS - GL2 carries the T159C , 182 A238G , and A330C sequence variants in addition to T28C ( Fig . 5A , Fig . S3 ) . However , isolates 183 belonging to the four sub - clades and one isolate ( TWN - 080 ) that reversed the T28 genotype , 184 showed distinctly different mutation patterns ( red circles in Fig . 5A ) . In these isolates , we 185 detected that approximately 1 . 4 to 52 kbp fragments harboring the wild - type erm ( 41 ) T28 186 genotype were inserted by recombination around the erm ( 41 ) gene ( red and blue shaded boxes 187 in Fig . 5A , Fig . 5B ) . We also observed the phylogenetically high recombination potential of the 188 .

S3 ) . In contrast , erm ( 41 ) 189 from an isolate ( RVI3T , blue circles in Fig . 5A ) displayed the same mutation pattern as the 190 ancestral type , with the exception of wild - type T28 , and no recombination event was detected 191 in this genomic region of RVI3T ( Fig . 5A , B ) . 192 193 The relationship between MAS prevalent in Japan and Taiwan ( EA ) and previously described 194 prevalent clones worldwide 195 In addition to ABS isolates , we assembled publicly available WGS data for 127 MAS 196 clinical isolates from CF patients from seven countries ( listed in Table S3 ) ( 16 , 20 , 32 ) and 197 combined them with our data set . We identified 11 clusters ( MAS - GL1 to MAS - GL11 shown 198 in Fig . 6 ) , of which eight ( MAS - GL1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , and 11 ) could be considered as globally 199 dispersed clones , while the remaining three were specific to the target region ( MAS - GL5 , 7 , 200 and 10 shown in Fig . 6 ) . MAS - GL2 contained all isolates belonging to MAS - EA2 , which is the 201 second - largest cluster in Japan and Taiwan ( Fig . 3 ) , and is described as an internationally 202 spreading clone Mass5 ( 20 ) . Although TWN - 024 and TWN - 041 , carrying full - length erm ( 41 ) , 203 were clustered with DEN526 ( from Denmark ) and UNC618 ( from the USA ) in the MAS - GL8 , 204 the latter two isolates showed truncation of the erm ( 41 ) gene , as well as all other MAS isolates 205 ( Fig . 6 ) . The mutation pattern of the erm ( 41 ) gene in TWN - 024 and TWN - 041 was similar to 206 that in ABS isolates belonging to ABS - GL2 ( T28C , T159C , A238G , and A330C sequence 207 .

We also found one isolate ( JRH124 from the UK ) that did not belong 208 to any MAS - GL clusters , and sporadically displayed full - length erm ( 41 ) without T28C 209 substitution ( Fig . 6 ) . MAS - GL1 contained all isolates belonging to MAS - EA1 , DCC3 ( Mass1 ) , 210 and Mass3 ( 20 ) ( Fig . 6 , Fig . 7A ) . It should be noted that MAS - GL1 contained isolates from 211 patients during outbreaks in two CF centers ( 16 , 32 ) ( magenta boxes in Fig . 6 ) . 212 In our sample set , half of the MAS isolates belonged to MAS - GL1 ( MAS - EA1 ) . These 213 observations prompted us to further investigate MAS - GL1 phylogeny . We identified three sub - 214 clusters within the MAS - GL1 ( MAS - GL1 . 1 to MAS - GL1 . 3 , Fig . 7A ) and found that DCC3 215 ( Mass1 ) isolates , as well as isolates from patients during previous outbreaks , exclusively 216 belonged to MAS _ GL1 . 2 or MAS - GL1 . 3 ( Fig . 7A ) . In MAS clinical isolates from Japan and 217 Taiwan , 21 out of 105 ( 20 % ) belonged to MAS _ GL1 . 2 or MAS - GL1 . 3 , while 30 ( 28 . 6 % ) 218 belonged to MAS - GL1 . 1 ( Fig . 3 ) . To genetically characterize MAS isolates that belonged to 219 MAS _ GL1 . 2 or MAS - GL1 . 3 , we identified four genes that were significantly associated with 220 these clades ( p < 2 . 7e - 52 after Bonferroni correction , Fisher ' s exact test , Table S4 ) . These genes 221 included two resolvases , both of which may be unfunctional due to frameshift , a DGQHR 222 domain - containing hypothetical protein , and a site - specific DNA - adenine methyltransferase 223 DpnIIA ( Fig . 7B ) . We also found that the most recent common ancestor ( MRCA ) of MAS - GL1 224 retained the DpnIIA gene , and a descendant lineage leading to DCC3 also retained this gene , 225 meanwhile , another descendant lineage leading to Mass3 was determined to have lost this gene . 226 .

As such , 231 this serves as the first WGS - based epidemiological study focusing on MABC clinical isolates 232 from non - CF patients in East Asia , thus , expanding the previous findings reported for CF 233 patients in Western countries ( 16 – 22 , 33 ) . Our sample set , all of which were obtained from 234 patients diagnosed with pulmonary MABC disease , consisted of approximately half ABS , while 235 the other half were MAS , and a small number of BOL . No geographical differences were noted 236 in the subspecies composition of the three locations examined , which agrees with the results of 237 previous epidemiological studies on non - CF patients conducted by conventional methods in 238 Japan and other East Asian cohorts ( 12 , 34 , 35 ) . While the incidence of BOL was very low in 239 our cohort , BOL reportedly accounts for 10 – 20 % of MABC in European cohorts of CF patients 240 ( 22 , 36 ) . Although the composition of the three subspecies is difficult to compare directly , as it 241 primarily depends on the clinical and environmental settings of each institution , these 242 observations may suggest that there are differences in the geographic distribution of BOL 243 and / or the susceptibility to BOL between CF and non - CF patients . 244 .

Our genotyping analysis suggested that at least 57 % of MABC clinical 250 isolates were susceptible to macrolides due to the loss of function of the erm ( 41 ) gene , 251 suggesting that macrolide - containing regimens are effective in treating more than half of 252 MABC infections in our cohort . Notably , over 20 % of ABS carried the macrolide - susceptible 253 erm ( 41 ) T28C mutation , and this mutation was significantly enriched in one of four dominant 254 clones of MABC in this area . Although it is currently unknown whether the ABS erm ( 41 ) T28C 255 sequevar is present in similar proportions elsewhere , these results emphasize the clinical 256 importance of accurate genotyping of the rrl and erm ( 41 ) gene before initiation of MABC 257 treatment , as recommended by recent treatment guidelines for pulmonary MABC infection ( 14 , 258 15 ) . 259 There were several clusters of isolates from both Japan and Taiwan , but the number of 260 isolates in each cluster differed . In ABS isolates , 33 % and 22 % of isolates belonged to the 261 largest and second - largest clusters ( ABS - EA1 and ABS - EA2 ) , respectively , representing 262 dominant clones in Japan and Taiwan . Remarkably , the ABS erm ( 41 ) T28C mutation , which is 263 .

As for MAS , this trend was more pronounced , with more 266 than 70 % of MAS isolates belonging to two large clusters ( MAS - EA1 and MAS - EA2 ) . These 267 results suggest that specific clones of ABS and MAS are intensively isolated from non - CF 268 patients in Japan and Taiwan . A comparison of the population structure of the two MABC 269 subspecies revealed that MAS has higher nucleotide diversity and a larger gene repertoire , but 270 shows lower genetic distances among isolates belonging to the identified clusters . These results 271 suggest that MAS is a more genetically diverse population than ABS , and certain homologous 272 clones may adapt to preferentially infect the respiratory system . 273 Bryant et al . reported that two ABS clones ( DCC1 and DCC2 ) and one MAS clone 274 ( DCC3 ) are dominantly spreading worldwide ( 20 ) . Hence , we analyzed whether these dominant 275 clones also prevail in non - CF patients in East Asian regions . Our results indicate that clinical 276 isolates related to DCC1 clones are also common in Japan and Taiwan . However , no clinical 277 isolates related to DCC2 clones were identified in our sample set , and clinical isolates related 278 to DCC3 clones were not necessarily dominant in our sample set . Consistent with our results , 279 recent genomic epidemiological studies have also reported that DCC1 clones are predominant 280 in CF cohorts across the US , whereas DCC2 and DCC3 are not ( 19 , 22 ) . Thus , it is suggested 281 that the DCC1 clone is distributed worldwide and preferentially infects , and causes pulmonary 282 .

We also 284 identified several regionally - specific , and globally spreading clones . These observations imply 285 that some MABC clones can spread internationally , while others do not . Further genomic , 286 epigenomic , and phenotypic analyses are needed to understand the differences in pathogenicity , 287 as observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( 38 – 40 ) . 288 It should be noted that the ABS erm ( 41 ) T28C isolates from several countries belonged 289 exclusively to ABS - GL2 , indicating that this sequence variant can be considered as one of the 290 globally spreading clones . However , in a previous study ( 20 ) , the erm ( 41 ) T28C sequevar was 291 divided into several minor clusters and was not recognized as a single cluster ( Fig . 4 ) . This is 292 perhaps because our phylogenetic trees were estimated using the core - genome region without 293 recombination sites , whereas Bryant et al . included recombination sites in their estimation of 294 the phylogenetic tree ( 20 ) . Since the ABS erm ( 41 ) T28C isolates caused more recombination 295 events than other ABS isolates ( Fig . S3 ) , we presume that recombination had a relatively large 296 effect on the phylogenetic tree estimation and clustering of the ABS erm ( 41 ) T28C isolates ( 41 ) . 297 Notably , some isolates within ABS - GL2 appeared to reverse the wild - type T28 genotype in the 298 erm ( 41 ) gene . We identified two patterns of reversion of the wild - type T28 genotype . The first 299 is the reversion of the wild - type erm ( 41 ) T28 genotype by point mutation , while the second 300 involved the incorporation of the erm ( 41 ) gene from isolates belonging to other clusters into 301 .

It was also observed that isolates belonging to ABS - GL2 302 showed high recombination potential compared to those belonging to other clades . Since there 303 are no reports that the erm ( 41 ) T28C mutation is detrimental to the survival of the bacterium in 304 macrolide - free environments , one possible explanation for the “genetic throwback” is that the 305 isolates belonging to ABS - GL2 have undergone adaptive evolution to survive in the macrolide 306 environment within the host and that the isolates may be infecting other patients indirectly or 307 directly ( 42 ) . We also observed two MAS isolates carrying the full - length erm ( 41 ) genes with 308 the T28C mutant and one MAS isolate carrying the full - length erm ( 41 ) gene . These results 309 suggest that horizontal transfer of the erm ( 41 ) gene that alters macrolide susceptibility may 310 occur , although not frequently , between ABS and MAS . 311 In the region of this study , more than half of the MASs belonged to MAS - GL1 . This large 312 cluster was divided into three sub - clades , two of which ( MAS - GL1 . 2 and MAS - GL1 . 3 ) were 313 exclusively related to isolates from patients during outbreaks in two CF centers in the USA and 314 UK ( 16 , 32 ) , and were annotated as DCC3 ( 20 ) . Thus , we searched for genes that were 315 significantly associated with MAS - GL1 . 2 and MAS - GL1 . 3 . The genes included a functional 316 methyltransferase dpnIIA gene , which is expected to belong to the “DpnII restriction gene 317 cassette . ” DpnII only methylates double - stranded DNA , whereas DpnI can methylate both 318 single - and double - stranded DNA , although both enzymes act at 5 ' - GATC - 3 ' in DNA ( 43 ) . A 319 recent study demonstrated that the dpnIIA gene of MABC participates in altering the genome - 320 .

Although other mycobacterial species , such as Mycobacterium spp . QIA - 37 and 322 Mycobacterium sp . TRM80801 , express the homologue ( 69 . 4 % and 55 . 8 % identity in amino 323 acid sequence , data not shown ) , there is no other available functional information on the gene . 324 Note that the ratio of isolates related to DCC3 in our cohort was not necessarily higher than 325 those related to other MAS clades . This result is consistent with previous genomic 326 epidemiological studies using a set of clinical isolates from patients with CF ( 19 , 22 ) . In 327 addition , strains belonging to MAS - GL1 . 1 and MAS - GL2 ( = MAS - EA2 , Mass5 ) , which lost 328 the dpnIIA gene , were isolated to the same extent as isolates related to DCC3 . These results 329 indicate that , at least in our cohort , the dpnIIA gene alone does not serve as a determinant of 330 whether a MABC clone is dominant . Nevertheless , all strains isolated during nosocomial 331 outbreaks in CF centers ( 16 , 32 ) carry the dpnIIA gene . It is also noteworthy that a strain ( GO - 332 06 ) isolated from a nosocomial infection at the surgical site of several patients in Brazil ( 44 ) 333 still carries the dpnIIA gene , although it is not related to DCC3 ( Fig . 7 ) . Further research is 334 needed to determine how the acquisition of the dpnIIA gene led to the nosocomial outbreak of 335 MAS , and whether there are other cases of outbreaks caused by clade - specific gene acquisition , 336 to understand the pathogenic evolution of MABC . 337 The present study has several limitations . First , this study was conducted using MABC 338 clinical isolates from only four facilities in three locations ; therefore , further validation using 339 .

Second , there is a lack of information regarding 341 epidemiological links among patients . Analysis of the genetic distances between clinical 342 isolates from individuals showed the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of MABC 343 ( Fig . S2C ) ( 16 , 17 ) . Further analysis , including tracking of epidemiological linkages among 344 patients and environmental sampling , is required to understand the mode of transmission of 345 MABC . Finally , as there are few CF patients in Asia , our sample set did not include clinical 346 isolates derived from CF patients in Japan and Taiwan . Therefore , it cannot be determined 347 whether the detected area - specific clusters were caused simply by differences in the 348 geographical distribution of MABC or by differences in patients’ disease status ( CF or non - 349 CF ) . 350 In conclusion , we revealed prevalent clones and the incidence of macrolide resistance - 351 associated mutations in MABC isolated from non - CF patients in Japan and Taiwan . We also 352 clarified the relationship between these clones and previously described dominant clones in the 353 international CF patient community . Our results provide a cornerstone for WGS - based 354 epidemiological analysis of pulmonary MABC disease in the East Asian region . Furthermore , 355 it would be helpful for future studies to elucidate the genetic differences between globally 356 predominant and area - specific clones isolated from patients with and without CF . 357 358 .

We confirmed that all 362 patients met the diagnostic criteria for ATS / ERS / ESCMID / IDSA ( 14 ) . Of these clinical isolates , 363 117 were obtained from three hospitals in Japan ( Fukujuji Hospital , Keio University Hospital , 364 and Okinawa Chubu Hospital ) , and 103 isolates were obtained from a hospital in Taiwan 365 ( National Taiwan University Hospital ) . All isolates were classified as MABC by DDH 366 Mycobacteria ( Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial , Tokyo , Japan ) and / or MALDI - TOF MS 367 ( Bruker Daltonics , MA , USA ) , and were sub - cultured on 2 % Ogawa egg slants or 7H10 agar 368 plates supplemented with 10 % OADC ( BD BBL , MD , USA ) . 369 The genomic DNA of each isolate was extracted and purified using a standard 370 enzyme / organic solvent method ( 45 ) . A WGS library was constructed using the QIAseq FX 371 DNA Library Kit ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) . Sequencing was performed on the standard 372 NextSeq 550 platform ( Illumina Inc . , CA , USA ) using the NextSeq Mid Output Kit 2 . 5 ( 300 373 cycles , Illumina Inc . ) with 150 - mer paired - end short reads according to the manufacturer’s 374 instructions . All raw read data of newly sequenced strains in this study ( 220 isolates ) were 375 deposited into the DNA Data Bank of Japan ( DDBJ ) and the National Centre for Biotechnology 376 Information ( NCBI ) under BioProject accession number PRJDB10566 . 377 .

The number of contigs , N50 values , and raw coverage of each isolate are listed in 382 Table S2 . The data were combined with the publicly available complete genome sequence of 383 M . abscessus subsp . abscessus ATCC19977 ( 46 ) , M . abscessus subsp . massiliense JCM15300 384 ( 47 ) , and M . abscessus subsp . bolletii BD ( 48 ) . For phylogenetic analyses , we first performed 385 pairwise genome alignment between ATCC19977 and one of the clinical isolates using the 386 MUMmer package ( 49 ) to identify conserved genomic regions among these isolates and the 387 SNP sites located within these regions . We then combined all alignments into a whole - genome 388 alignment , in which each position corresponded to that of the complete genome of ATCC19977 389 using custom Perl scripts . We identified 3 , 638 , 122 bp of the ATCC19977 genome that was 390 conserved among all clinical isolates ( core - genome ) and identified 235 , 540 variable positions 391 within the core - genome . This alignment was used to infer recombination sites using Gubbins 392 ( 50 ) , and 8 , 358 recombinogenic sites were detected and removed from the alignment . The 393 resulting alignment containing 240 , 429 recombination - free variable positions located in the 394 core - genome region were used to reconstruct a maximum - likelihood tree using RAxML ver . 395 8 . 2 . 12 ( 51 ) with the General Time Reversible ( GTR ) - GAMMA model of nucleotide 396 .

To confirm phylogeny - based subspecies 397 identification , ANI values among all MABC isolates were calculated using fastANI with default 398 settings ( 52 ) . Multiple whole - genome alignments were used to investigate the genotypes of the 399 erm ( 41 ) gene ( MAB _ 2297 , 2 , 345 , 955 bp to 2 , 346 , 476 bp in ATCC19977 ) and the rrl gene 400 ( MAB _ r5052 , 1 , 464 , 208 bp to 1 , 467 , 319 bp in ATCC19977 ) of all isolates using SeqKit ( 53 ) . 401 After subspecies identification , the maximum - likelihood phylogeny within each ABS and 402 MAS was constructed as described above . The complete genome sequences of ATCC19977 403 and JCM15300 were used as a reference , respectively . Alignments containing 76 , 114 and 404 48 , 718 recombination - free variable positions located on their core - genome regions ( 3 , 963 , 788 405 bp for ABS and 4 , 033 , 769 bp for MAS ) were used to estimate maximum - likelihood 406 phylogenies , respectively . The resulting phylogenetic trees were used to identify clusters ( ABS - 407 EA and MAS - EA clusters ) in Japan and Taiwan using the TreeGubbins software with options 408 ' - s ( significance cut - off level ) 0 . 01 , - p ( number of permutations to run to test significance ) 409 10000 ' ( https : / / github . com / simonrharris / tree _ gubbins ) . Only detected clusters from more than 410 one location and greater than three isolates were considered ABS - EA / MAS - EA clusters to 411 exclude possible point source outbreaks . 412 To assess the relationships among Japanese ( around Tokyo and Okinawa ) , Taiwanese , 413 and circulating clones of ABS or MAS in a total of eight countries , we combined our data set 414 with publicly available WGS data from 476 MABC clinical isolates ( 349 ABS and 127 MAS , 415 .

These were analyzed in three previous WGS - based epidemiological studies ( 16 , 20 , 416 32 ) , with one strain per patient and known cluster information to which each isolate belongs 417 ( A . Floto , J . Parkhill , and J . Bryant , personal communication ) . All additional raw read data 418 were obtained from the Sequence Read Archive ( SRA ) and assembled de novo using the Shovill 419 pipeline . To measure the assembly quality of these additional isolates , we calculated the 420 genome fraction ( % ) of each isolate , which is the total number of aligned bases in the reference 421 genomes ( ATCC19977 or JCM15300 ) using QUAST software ( 54 ) . We used only isolates with 422 genome fractions greater than 85 % for downstream analyses ( Fig . S4 ) . Alignments containing 423 102 , 613 and 58 , 975 recombination - free variable positions located on their core - genome regions 424 ( 3 , 584 , 621 bp for ABS and 3 , 789 , 583 bp for MAS ) were used to estimate maximum - likelihood 425 phylogenies , and cluster analysis was performed as described above . 426 427 Analysis of lineage - associated genes 428 Lineage - associated genes were identified as described previously ( 15 ) . In brief , we 429 annotated all draft genomes and complete genome sequences of the three type strains 430 ( ATCC19977 , JCM15300 , and BD ) of MABC using DFAST _ core ver . 1 . 0 . 3 with default 431 settings ( 55 ) and Roary software with default settings ( 56 ) to compute core genes or accessory 432 genes . We identified accessory genes that were significantly associated with lineage using the 433 Scoary ( 57 ) . 434 .
