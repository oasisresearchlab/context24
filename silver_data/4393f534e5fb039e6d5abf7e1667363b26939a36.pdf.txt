GPI - linked membrane folate receptors ( MFRs ) have been implicated in the receptor - mediated uptake of reduced folate cofactors and folate - based chemotherapeutic drugs . We have studied the biosyn - thetic transport to and internalization of MFR isoform et in KB - cells . MFR - et was synthesized as a 32 - kD pro - tein and converted in a maturely glycosylated 36 - 38 - kD protein 1 h after synthesis . 32 - kD MFR - a was com - pletely soluble in Triton X - 100 at 0°C . In contrast , only 33 % of the 36 - 38 - kD species could be solubilized at these conditions whereas complete solubilization was obtained in Triton X - 100 at 37°C or in the presence of saponin at 0°C . Similar solubilization characteristics were found when MFR - et at the plasma membrane was labeled with a crosslinkable 125I - labeled photoaffinity - analog of folic acid as a ligand . Triton X - 100 - insoluble membrane domains containing MFR - a could be sepa - rated from soluble MFR - a on sucrose flotation gradi - ents . Only Triton X - 100 soluble MFR - a was internalized from the plasma membrane . The reduced - folate - car - rier , an integral membrane protein capable of translo - cating ( anti - ) folates across membranes , was completely excluded from the Triton X - 100 - resistant membrane domains . Internalized MFR - a recycled slowly to the cell surface during which it remained soluble in Triton X - 100 at 0°C . Using immunoelectron microscopy , we found MFR - o ~ along the entire endocytic pathway : in clathrin - coated buds and vesicles , and in small and large endosomal vacuoles . In conclusion , our data indi - cate that a large fraction , if not all , of internalizing MFR - et bypasses caveolae . - METHYLTETRAHYDROFOLIC acid is an essential vita - min for the biosynthesis of deoxythymidylic acid , pu - rines and the amino acids methionine and serine ( Antony , 1992 ) . For several decades the folate - metabo - lism has been exploited as a target for chemotherapeutic treatment of a variety of cancers using cytotoxic folate - antag - onists such as methotrexate ( Bertino , 1993 ) . Transport across membranes of ( anti - ) folates is one of the critical de - terminants in their chemotherapeutic effectiveness . Two functionally different systems have been implicated in their cellular uptake : ( 1 ) the Reduced - Folate - Carrier ( RFC ) 1 ( Sirotnak , 1985 ) , which probably uses an anion - exchange mechanism to introduce ( anti - ) folates into the cytosol ( Henderson et al . , 1986 ) , and ( 2 ) Membrane Folate Please address all correspondence to Dr .

Receptors ( MFRs ) , which internalize ( anti - ) folates by a receptor - mediated process . After internalization , folates are retained in the cytoplasm by polyglutamation ( McGuire et al . , 1980 ) . The transport kinetics by and affinities for ( anti - ) folates of both systems differ significantly ( Ratnam and Freis - heim , 1990 ; Henderson , 1990 ; Anthony , 1992 ) . The RFC has a relatively high affinity for reduced folates and the antifolate methotrexate ( Kin : 1 - 10 txM ) but has a relatively poor affinity for the oxidized ' folate , folic acid ( Km : 200 - 400 ~ M ) . In contrast , MFRs have high affinities for folic acid ( K ~ : 0 . 1 - 1 nM ) and reduced folates ( Kd : 1 - 10 nM ) but relatively low affinities for methotrexate ( Ka > 100 nM ) . Both of these transport systems can be expressed sepa - rately or complementary to each other in one cell ( Jansen et al . , 1989 ; Westerhof et al : , 1991 , 1993 , 1994 ) . The func - tion of such simultaneous expression of both systems in one cell remains unclear . Although the cell and tissue dis - tribution of MFRs ( Weitman et al . , 1992 ; Ross et al . , 1994 ) has been documented in gre ~ iter detail than the RFC ( Matherly et al . , 1994 ) , both systems are constitutively ex - pressed in many tissues and ~ celi types . Recently two cDNAs have been isolated encoding a protein with RFC - activity © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 96 / 01 / 35 / 13 $ 2 . 00 The Joumal of Cell Biology , Volume 132 , Numbers 1 & 2 , January 1996 35 - 47 35 from mouse ( Dixon et al . , 1994 ) , hamster ( Williams et al . , 1994 ) , and human ( Williams and Flintoff , 1995 ) cDNA - libraries , predicting that the RFC is a glycosylated integral membrane protein that spans the membrane 12 times . While the translocation of folates by the RFC occurs di - rectly at the plasma membrane ( Sirotnak , 1985 ) , the up - take by MFRs is thought to occur after internalization of the receptors into the cells . Several cDNAs encoding at least three different isoforms of MFRs have been isolated ( Ratnam et al . , 1989 ; Elwood , 1989 ; Lacey et al . , 1989 ; Sa - dasivan and Rothenberg , 1989 ; Brigle et al . , 1991 ; Shen et al . , 1994 ) , and it has been well established that their prod - ucts are attached to membranes by a glycosyl - phosphati - dyl - inositol ( GPI ) - anchor ( Lacey et al . , 1989 ; Luhrs and Slomiany , 1989 ; Alberti et al . , 1990 ) . In general , GPI - linked proteins are internalized by cells more slowly than integral membrane receptors and possibly through differ - ent internalization pathways ( Low , 1989 ; Lisanti et al . , 1990 ; Bamezai et al . , 1992 ; Keller et al . , 1992 ; Watts and Marsh , 1992 ) . Especially with respect to the uptake of ( anti - ) folates , Anderson and colleagues have shown that in MA - 104 monkey kidney cells MFR - c ~ binds and inter - nalizes folates after which the receptor recycles to the cell surface . Furthermore , their study provided evidence that MFR - a works in tandem with a probenecid - sensitive car - rier ( Kamen et al . , 1988 , 1991 ) . Electronmicroscopy in combination with these biochemical data led them to pro - pose a model for the uptake of small molecules such as ( anti - ) folates , termed potocytosis ( Rothberg et al . , 1990a ; Anderson , 1993a ) . In this model MFR - ~ is entirely clus - tered in caveolae , which were originally described as small , non - clathrin - coated invaginations at the plasma membrane ( Palade and Bruns , 1968 ) and serve to concen - trate folates . After sealing of the caveolae , rapid acidifica - tion of the caveolar content would cause dissociation of folates from MFR - a after which a putative carrier protein would translocate the folates across the membrane into the cytosol . During this process caveolae remain attached to the plasma membrane . To complete the cycle the caveo - lae open and expose MFR - c ~ to the extracellular space again . Caveolae differ from clathrin - coated buds and vesi - cles which pinch off from the plasma membrane after un - coating the fuse with the endosomal system . However , re - cently it was shown that clustering of MFR - et and other GPI - linked proteins in caveolae could be induced by spe - cific antibodies ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) . Since the clustering of MFR - a in caveolae , as reported by Anderson and col - leagues , could have been induced by antibody binding , the mechanism by which MFR - a mediates the uptake of ( anti - ) folates into cells remains to be established . In addition , it has been reported that internalization of MFR - a and other GPI - linked proteins proceeds via clathrin - coated or non - clathrin - coated vesicles , both capable of fusing with the entire endosomal system ( Hjelle et al . , 1991 ; Nykjzer et al . , 1992 ; Watts and Marsh , 1992 ; Van Deurs et al . , 1993 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1994 ) . Caveolae are thought to exist in many different cell types ( Severs , 1988 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) . The integrity of caveolae depends on the presence of cholesterol ( Roth - berg et al . , 1990b ; Cerneus et al . , 1993 ) . Caveolae have been shown to contain multiple GPI - linked proteins ( Ying et al . , 1992 ) , an IP3 - sensitive Ca2 + - channel ( Fujimoto et al . , 1992 ) , and an ATP - sensitive Ca2÷ - pump ( Fujimoto , 1993 ) . Caveolin is a major constituent of caveolae ( Glen - ney and Soppet , 1992 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) . VIP21 , which was shown to be identical to caveolin ( Glenney , 1992 ) , has also been localized to the trans - Golgi network and has been proposed to be part of the biosynthetic apical sorting machinery in epithelial cells ( Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ; Du - pree et al . , 1993 ) . Differential solubilization of GPI - linked proteins in non - ionic detergents ( for review see Low , 1989 ) has also been implicated in their sorting to the apical domain of the plasma membrane in epithelial cells ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Cerneus et al . , 1993 ; Garcia et al . , 1993 ) . In this model GPI - linked proteins together with glycosphin - golipids form membrane domains in the trans - Golgi net - work , which are then targeted to the apical domain of the plasma membrane , as initially proposed by Simons and van Meer ( 1988 ) . Recently , biochemical methods based on the differential solubilization characteristics in non - ionic detergents such as Triton X - 100 have become available to isolate membrane domains , which are enriched in GPI - linked proteins and may represent caveolae ( Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Fiedler et al . , 1993 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994a ; Chang et al . , 1994 ) . In addition to GPI - linked proteins isolated Triton X - 100 - insoluble membrane domains also contained GTP - binding proteins and protein - tyrosine kinases . This has led to the proposi - tion of another function for caveolae , i . e . , their involve - ment in signal transduction ( Anderson , 1993a , b ; Lisanti et al . , 1994b ) . In the present study , we have used iodinated crosslink - able photoaffinity analogs of folic acid and the antifolate methotrexate to study the trafficking of functional MFR - a and RFC molecules . We have found correlations between the solubilization characteristics of GPI - linked MFR - e ~ with its biosynthesis , internalization , and recycling . Our results show that MFR - a present in detergent - resistant membrane domains are excluded from internalization . Only a small amount of Triton X - 100 soluble MFR - et is in - ternalized by the cells , at least in part via clathrin - coated vesicles , and reaches the endosomal compartments . Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Biosynthetic Labeling KB nasopharyngeal carcinoma , and leukemic CCRF - CEM - 7A ( Jansen et al . , 1990b ) cells were cultured in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 without folic acid ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) , supplemented with 10 % dialyzed FCS and 1 nM of folinic acid ( 6S - 5 - formyltetrahydro - folate ) . 24 h before each experiment the folinic acid was removed from the cells by changing the medium . For metabolic labeling , cells were de - pleted from methionine , pulse labeled at 37°C with 3 . 7 MBq / ml of 35Smethionine ( Tran - S - label , 185 MBq / ml , 40 TBq / mmol , ICN Biomedi - cals , Inc . , CA ) for 15 min and chased for the indicated time periods at 37°C in culture medium containing 100 ixM unlabeled methionine ( Rijn - boutt et al . , 1992 ) . The media were prewarmed and equilibrated in a 5 % CO2 - atmosphere before use . Next the cells were lysed in PBS containing 1 % Triton X - 100 and 1 mM PMSF at 0°C and aliquots of the lysates were incubated at 37 or 0°C in the absence or presence of 0 . 2 % saponin . Deter - gent - insoluble material was subsequently removed by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g at 4°C . Finally , the lysates were immunoprecipitated for MFR - a and immunoprecipitations were analyzed by separation on SDS - PAGE . Quantitation of the gels was performed using a Phospho - Imager ( Molecu - lar Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 132 , 1996 36 Synthesis of Pte - ASA - Lys N ~ - Pteroyl - N ~ ( 4 ' - azidosalicyl ) - L - Lysine was prepared by the reaction of N ~ - Nl° - ( trifluoroacetyl ) pteroyl - L - Lysine ( McAlinden et al . , 1991 ) and 4 - azidosalicylic acid succinimyl ester in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 . 5 at 16°C in subdued light ( Price et al . , 1986 ) . The trifluoroacetyl group was removed concurrently by the addition of 40 mM Li2CO 3 solution . The resulting mixture was acidified using 10 % aqueous citric acid and the resulting solid was isolated after lyophylization . The pellet was washed successively with water , ethanol , and diethylether . The fine yellow powder thus obtained was ~ 70 % pure by thin layer chromatography ( Rf = 0 , 15 ) on silica ( Kodak 13181 ) using a mixture of isopropanol , methanol , and concen - trated NH4OH of 3 : 1 : 1 . A single slower moving impurity ( Rf = 0 . 06 ) was detected which reacted positively with ninhydrine and was assumed to be N " pteroyl - L - Lysine based upon its chromatographic retention time . This material was employed in the subsequent iodination step without further purification . The affinity for Pte - ASA - Lys is similar as for folic acid as demonstrated by equimolar competition for MFR - a of 3Hfolic acid bind - ing by Pte - ASA - Lys and Pte125IASA - Lys binding by folic acid ( results not shown ) . Photoaffinity Labeling and Endocytosis of MFR - a Labeling of MFR - a present at the plasma membrane of KB cells was per - formed either by lactoperoxidase - mediated iodination of the cell surface as decribed previously ( Cerneus et al . , 1993 ) or using a crosslinkable pho - toaffinity analog of folic acid , pteroyl - N ~ - ( 4 - azido - 5 - lZSIiodosalicylyc ) - L - lysine ( Pte - 125IASA - Lys ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Iodination of 200 p ~ g Pte - ASA - Lys in 200 ~ 1 dimethylformamide was performed as described by Price et al . ( 1986 , 1987 ) in subdued red light using 1 . 5 mCi 125I and five iodobeads ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . After 30 min at room temperature the solution was applied to a fluorescent , silica gel TLC sheet which was developed in a mixture of 3 : 1 : 1 ( vol / vol ) isopropanol : methanol : NH4OH . After 3 h Pte - 125IASA - Lys ( RF : 0 . 4 ) was identified using short - wave UV light ( 266 nm ) , carefully scraped and extracted in methanol . After pelleting the sili - cagel at 13 , 000 g , the methanol was evaporated under N 2 and the Pte - 1251ASA - Lys was dissolved in 200 ~ 1 160 mM Hepes , 2 mM MgC12 ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Aliquots were used to determine the concentration ( usually 170 - 210 pmol / lxl ) in a spectrophotometer at 282 nm and the specific activity ( usu - ally 2 . 5 - 3 nCi / pmol ) in a gamma counter . For endocytosis , the cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 without folic acid , supplemented with 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 3 ( RPMI - Hepes ) on ice . To remove extracellularly bound ligands the cells were washed three times on ice with 25 mM Mes , 2 mM CaCI2 , 140 mM NaCI , pH 4 . 5 , followed by three times with RPMI - Hepes on ice . Next the cells were incubated in subdued red light in 50 pmol / ml Pte - 1251ASA - Lys in RPMI - Hepes for 15 min on ice . The cells were washed three times with RPMI - Hepes and irradiated with high intensity 365 nm UV - light ( Spec - troline SB - 100 / F , Spectronics Corporation , Westbury , NY ) to covalently bind the Pte - 125IASA - Lys to MFR - a at the cell surface . To remove non - specifically incorporated or noncovalently bound Pte - 1251ASA - Lys , the ceils were washed twice with 25 mM Mes , 2 mM CaCI2 , 140 mM NaCI , pH 4 . 5 containing 1 mg / ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as a scavenger mole - cule , followed by three times with RPMI - Hepes on ice . Next the cells were chased for the indicated periods of time at 37°C in RPMI - Hepes , supple - mented with l nM folinic acid . To distinguish internalized MFR - a from MFR - ct at the plasma membrane , the cells were washed once with ice - cold RPMI - Hepes , washed twice with ice - cold 25 mM Mes , 2 mM CaCI z , 140 mM NaC1 , pH 5 . 5 , and incubated with 50 mU / ml neuraminidase ( Boeh - ringer , Mannheim , Germany ) in the latter buffer for 1 h on ice . To stop the neuraminidase - mediated desialylation of proteins at the plasma mem - brane , the cells were washed three times with PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 1 mM PMSF and lysed in 1 % NP - 40 in H20 containing 1 rag / ml sialylated fetuin for 30 rain on ice . Aliquots of the lysates were incu - bated in the absence or in the presence of 0 . 2 % saponin on ice and deter - gent - insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g at 4°C . Counting aliquots of the lysates and the insoluble pellets showed that in the presence of saponin no counts were found in the pellets , indicating complete solubilization of MFR - a under these conditions . The lysates were analyzed on 1 dimensional isoelectric focussing gels with a linear pH - range from 3 . 9 to 8 . 8 as described previously ( Rijnboutt et al . , 1992 ) and visualized by autoradiography . Quantitation of SDS - PAGE and IEF gels was performed using a Phospho - Imager ( Molecular Dynamics ) . For IEF gels , neuraminidase - sensitive species of MFR - c ~ were quantitated together and expressed as a percentage of the total . Analysis of Triton X - l O , O - insoluble Membrane Domains on Sucrose Flotation Gradients The isolation of Triton X - lOO - insoluble membrane domains on sucrose fotation gradients was performed using the method described by Fiedler et al . ( 1993 ) and Sargiacomo et al . ( 1993 ) . The cells were labeled with Pte - 125IASA - Lys as described above . After photoaffinity labeling , described as above , the cells were kept on ice or incubated at 37°C in RPMI - Hepes . Subsequently , the ceils were washed with ice - cold RPMl - Hepes and lysed at 0°C in 1 % Triton in 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF and 140 mM NaC1 containing 1 % Triton X - 100 in the absence or the presence of 0 . 2 % saponin . In case fractions of Percoll gradients were analyzed , the fractions of interest were pooled and vesicles were lysed using Triton X - 100 at a final concentration of 1 % . Next 2 ml of the lysate were mixed with 2 ml 2 . 4 M sucrose in 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF and 140 mM NaCI in an SW41 tube and carefully overlayed with subsequently 6 ml 1 . 1 M sucrose and 2 ml 0 . 15 M sucrose in the same buffer ( Beckman Instrs . , Fullerton , CA ) . The lysates were fractionated at 100 , 000 g for 18 h at 4°C and aliquots of the fractions were analyzed using SDS - PAGE . o o ? oo .

Endocytosis of Folate Receptors 37 Quantitation of the gels was performed using a Phospho - lmager ( Molecu - lar Dynamics ) . For some experiments ( as in Fig . 5 ) , CEM - 7A cells were labeled with N ~ - ( 4 - amino - 4 - deoxy - 10 - methylpteroyl ) - N ~ - ( 4 - azido - 5 - 125I - iodosalicylyl ) - L - lysine ( APA - [ 12SI ] ASA - Lys ) , a photoaffinity analog of the antifolate methotrexate constructed for probing the Reduced Folate Car - rier ( RFC ) ( Price et al . , 1987 ; Freisheim et al . , 1988 , 1992 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Label - ing of the RFC at the plasma membrane of 2 . 107 CEM - 7A cells using APA - [ I25I ] ASA - Lys was performed in I ml 160 mM Hepes , 2 mM MgCI2 ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 15 rain on ice and followed by irradiation with UV - light . Recycling of MFR - a and SubceUular Fractionation on Percoll Gradients To study recycling of internalized MFR - tx to the cell surface , KB - ceUs were labeled with Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys as described above and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with RPMI - Hepes , supplemented with 1 nM leucovorin . Next the cells were washed three times with ice - cold RPMI - Hepes followed by two incubations of 10 rain with 25 mM Mes , 2 mM CaC12 , 140 mM NaCI , 1 mg / ml BSA , pH 4 . 5 , to remove all extracellularly bound Pte - [ ~ SI ] ASA - Lys . After washing three times with RPMI - Hepes , the ceils were irradi - ated with UV light as described above and incubated at 37 ~ C for the indi - cated periods of time . For some experiments ( as in Fig . 7 / 4 ) , the cells were incubated at 37°C before irradiation with UV light , allowing the re - moval of ligand bound to recycled MFR - a with a final acidic wash . Next the cells were washed once with ice - cold RPMI - Hepes and once with ho - mogenization buffer ( 0 . 25 M sucrose , 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 2 , 1 mM EDTA , and i mM PMSF ) . The cells were homogenized on ice in 0 . 60 - ml homoge - nization buffer by passing them ten times through a 25 - G needle . A post - nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C and 400 I ~ 1 PNS was fractionated on 7 . 4 ml 20 % Percoll - gradients ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Piscataway , N . J . ) in homogenization buffer , by centrifugation at 32 , 000 rpm ( 100 , 000 g ) for 25 rain at 4°C in a Beckman 50Ti rotor . Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys - labeled MFR - ct was detected in the frac - tions by counting in a gamma counter . Ultracryotomy and Immunolabeling The endocytic pathway was visualized by incubating the cells for I h with BSA - Gold ( 0 5 nm , final OD 10 ) . Before fixation the BSA - gold was re - moved by washing three times with culture medium . Cells were fixed at room temperature by adding 1 ml 4 % paraformaldehyde , 0 . 4 % glutaral - dehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 to 1 ml medium . After 10 min the fixative / medium mixture was replaced by 2 % paraformaldehyde , 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 , 1 M phosphate buffer . 50 min later the cells were removed from the petri dish using a rubber policeman and transferred to an Eppendorf vial . The cells were spun down and washed three times with PBS , 0 . 15 M glycine , and finally pelleted in 10 % gelatin in phosphate buffer . The gelatin was allowed to solidify , and small cubic blocks were cut at 4°C and infused with 2 . 3 M sucrose in phosphate buffer for at least 2 h at 4°C . The blocks were mounted on a copper specimen holder and frozen in liquid nitrogen . Ultrathin cryosections were prepared on a Leica U1 - tracut S ( Vienna , Austria ) and either single labeled for MFR - ct or double labeled ( Geuze et al . , 1981 ) for the folate receptor and clathfin ( Ahle et al . , 1988 ) . The relative distribution of MFR - ct immunoreactive sites was deter - mined by counting gold particles over cell profiles containing a Golgi ap - paratus and a nucleus . In three different grids 10 profiles were counted . The number of gold particles was measured over the plasma membrane ( including coated pits and caveolae ) , the endosomal apparatus ( tubulo - vesic - ular structures , endosomes , multivesicular endosomes ; all containing BSA - gold ) , the biosynthetic pathway ( RER , Golgi apparatus , trans - Golgi reticulum ) , and other vesicles . Results Triton X - 100 Insolubility of MFR - a during Passage through the Golgi Complex KB cells , a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line , ex - press large amounts ( 2 ~ . X 107 receptors / cell ) of MFR - a at their cell surface ( McHugh and Cheng , 1979 ; Antony et al . , 1985 ; Luhrs et a1 . ¢1986 ; Elwood et al . , 1986 ) . The pro - tein can be released completely by PI - PLC ( results not shown ; Luhrs and Slomiany , 1989 ) indicating anchoring to membranes by a glycosyl - phosphatidyl - inositol ( GPI ) an - chor ( Lacey et al . , 1989 ; Alberti et al . , 1990 ) . Several re - cent reports indicate that GPI - linked proteins become in - soluble in the detergent Triton X - 100 at 0°C during maturation of the oligosaccharide chains ( Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ; Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Dr ~ berov ~ i and Dr ~ iber , 1993 ; Cerneus et al . , 1993 ; Garcia et al . , 1993 ) . To study the incorporation of MFR - ot in Triton X - 100 - insolu - ble membrane domains , KB cells were labeled with [ 35S ] methionine and chased after which the cells were lysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 at 0°C . Aliquots of these lysates were then incubated in the presence or absence of the choles - terol complexing agent saponin and MFR - et was immuno - precipitated and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . MFR2 was synthesized as a 32 - kD precursor which was converted to a 36 - 38 - kD mature species starting after 1 h of chase ( Fig . 2 A ) . This increase in apparent molecular weight is due to the conversion of high - mannose N - linked oligosaccharide chains to the complex type ( Luhrs , 1991 ) . The 32 - kD precursor of MFR - et remained completely sol - uble in Triton X - 100 , whereas after 2 h of chase only 33 . 7 % _ + 4 . 8 ( n = 24 ) of mature MFR - et could be solubi - lized in Triton X - 100 at 0°C . The solubilization of the full complement of mature MFR - et was obtained by the addi - Figure 2 . Triton X - 100 solubility of biosynthetic species of MFR - a .

Raising the lysis - temperature or addition of other detergents such as 1 % deoxycholate or 1 % SDS to the lysates had no effect on the amount of solubilized material ( data not shown ) . Simi - lar solubilization characteristics for MFR - a were also found in other cell types indicating that the effect is inde - pendent of the expression level of MFR - ot or cell type . Since there was already some 36 - 38 - kD present after 1 h of chase which was completely soluble in Triton X - 100 in the absence of saponin ( Fig . 2 A ) , the transfer of MFR - ct to its GPI - anchor , as well as the formation of complex - type N - linked oligosaccharides preceded Triton X - 100 in - solubility . Both MFR - a Pools Present at the Cell Surface Are Capable of Binding Ligand Next we examined whether these solubilization character - istics were maintained on the cell surface . To this end , the cell surface of KB cells was iodinated , the cells were lysed as in the previous experiment and MFR - et was immuno - precipitated and analyzed on SDS - PAGE . Fig . 3 shows that 32 . 8 % - - - 3 . 3 ( n = 6 ) of MFR - et was solubilized in Tri - ton X - 100 at 0°C and that addition of 0 . 2 % saponin to the lysate resulted in complete solubilization . To determine whether all MFR - et present at the cell surface was capable of binding ligand , bound ligands were removed by an acid wash and the cells were incubated with Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys ( Fig . 1 ) , an iodinated crosslinkable photoaffinity analog of folic acid . After binding , the excess of ligand was removed by extensive washing , cross - linking was induced by irradia - tion with UV - light and the cells were lysed . Analysis of the lysates on SDS - PAGE shows ( Fig . 3 ) that Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys - labeled MFR - a migrated as a single band of 36 - 38 - kD . Solubilization characteristics similar to 125I - lactoper - oxidase and [ 35S ] methionine ( Fig . 2 ) - labeled MFR - et were found ( data not shown ) . Binding of Pte - p2SI ] ASA - Lys to the ceils could be completely prevented in the presence of 5 IxM folic acid . Taken together , these data show that the plasma membrane MFR - et is present in two pools , a Triton X - 100 soluble and insoluble pool . Both of these MFR - ot pools bind Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys with a high specificity . The insolubility is acquired during passage of the Golgi - com - plex , possibly by incorporation into Triton X - 100 - insolu - ble membrane domains ( Simons and Van Meer , 1988 ; Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . Using sucrose flotation gradients , Fiedler et al . ( 1993 ) and Sargiacomo et al . ( 1993 ) have reported that such Tri - ton X - 100 - insoluble membrane domains were highly en - riched in GPI - linked proteins and caveolin and probably represent caveolae . We performed an analogous experi - ment using Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys as a ligand for MFR - et to determine whether Triton X - 100 insoluble MFR - a in KB cells was present in similar membrane domains . When cells were lysed in Triton X - 100 65 - 70 % of MFR - ot was found on top of a sucrose flotation gradient ( fractions 9 - 11 ) , whereas the soluble fraction remained at the bottom of the gradient ( fractions 1 - 5 ; Fig . 4 A ) . This shows that the insol - Figure 3 . Triton X - 100 solubility MFR - ct at the cell surface .

The immunoprecipitates of 125I - labeled cells and aliquots of the lysates of the cells labeled with Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys were analyzed on SDS - PAGE . Apparent molecu - lar weight markers are indicated on the left ( kD ) . Figure 4 . Isolation of Triton X - 100 - insoluble membrane do - mains containing MFR - a . KB cells were labeled with Pte - [ 12SI ] ASA - Lys and lysed in Triton X - 100 in the absence ( A , C , and D ) or presence ( B ) of 0 . 2 % saponin . The lysates were frac - tionated on sucrose flotation gradients as described in Materials and Methods and aliquots of the fractions were analyzed on SDS - PAGE . In C and D the cells were allowed to internalize MFR - ct labeled with Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys after which the cells were D or were not C washed with an acidic MES - buffer to remove nonin - ternalized ligand . Rijnboutt et al . Endocytosis of Folate Receptors 39 uble fraction of MFR - a was present in Triton X - 100 - insol - uble plasma membrane domains . After addition of 0 . 2 % saponin during lysis of the cells MFR - a was recovered completely at the bottom of the gradient ( Fig . 4 B ) , show - ing that removal of cholesterol interferes with their integ - rity , as was previously suggested for alkaline phosphatase in the human chorion carcinoma cell line BeWo ( Cemeus et al . , 1993 ) . The Reduced Folate Carrier Is Absent from Triton X - lOO - insoluble Microdomains Rothberg et al . ( 1990 ) have proposed that the uptake of folates by MFR - a takes place in caveolae in a process which has been termed potocytosis . During this process MFR - ot concentrates folates in caveolae after which the folates are translocated to the cytosol by an as yet uniden - tified carrier protein . A good candidate protein to fulfill this role is the Reduced Folate Carrier ( RFC ) , which has been implicated in ( anti - ) folate translocation across the plasma membrane and is thought to be an integral mem - brane protein ( Dixon et al . , 1994 ; Williams et al . , 1994 ) . Since the distribution of MFR - a on sucrose flotation gra - dients was identical to the characteristic profile reported for GPI - linked proteins and a few integral membrane pro - teins ( Fiedler et al . , 1993 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994a ) , we examined whether the RFC was present in Triton X - 100 - insoluble plasma membrane domains . To visualize the RFC , a similar cross - linkable photoaffinity folate analog was used . This photoprobe ( APA - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys ; Fig . 1 ) was based on the antifolate methotrexate , for which the RFC has a high affinity ( Jansen et al . , 1990b ) . Based on kinetic studies with ( anti - ) folates having prefer - ential affinities for either MFR - a or the RFC , KB cells have been shown to functionally express both MFR - ~ t and the RFC simultaneously , although the RFC is expressed in limited qualitative amounts in KB cells ( Jansen et al . , 1990a ; Westerhof et al . , 1991 , 1993 , 1994 ) . Therefore , APA - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys was used to label the RFC in CEM - 7A cells , a previously isolated subline of human leukemia CCRF - CEM cells overexpressing the RFC more than 10 - fold ( Jansen et al . , 1990b ) . Next the cells were lysed in Tri - ton X - 100 at 0°C and run on sucrose flotation gradients . A diffuse band of 70 - - 90 kD indicative for the RFC was de - tected on SDS - PAGE as shown in previous studies ( Freis - heim et al . , 1988 , 1992 ) and found on the bottom of the su - crose gradient ( Fig . 5 ) . We conclude that the RFC is excluded from Triton X - 100 - insoluble plasma membrane domains . If these domains represent caveolae , RFC can - not function in tandem with MFR - a during potocytosis of folates ( Kamen et al . , 1991 ) . MFR - c ~ was not detected in this experiment because CEM - 7A cells do not express folate receptors . However , when APA - [ 12SI ] ASA - Lys was used to label KB cells , the photoprobe also specifically la - beled MFR - a without changing its distribution on the su - crose gradient ( data not shown ) . In another control exper - iment in which cell surface - iodinated KB cells as well as CEM - 7A cells were tysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 and run on sucrose flotation gradients , a small subset of iodinated membrane proteins were found on top of the gradients whereas the bulk of iodinated material was found on the Figure 5 . The reduced folate carrier is absent from Triton X - 100 - insoluble membrane domains . CEM - 7A cells , which overexpress the reduced folate carrier were labeled using APA - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys and lysed in Triton X - 100 at 0°C . The lysate was fractionated on su - crose flotation gradients as described in Materials and Methods and aliquots of the fractions were analyzed on SDS - PAGE . The 69 - kD band in lane 10 has been identified to be serum albumin , which has some nonspecific binding capacity for APA - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys . bottom , showing the specificity of the flotation procedure ( data not shown ) . Only Triton X - lOO - - soluble MFR - a Is Internalized by KB Cells Next we studied the internalization of MFR - a in KB cells . After removing bound ligands by an acidic wash , the cells were labeled with Pte - [ lzsI ] ASA - Lys , washed and irradi - ated with UV - light to covalently link the ligand to MFR - a . The cells were allowed to internalize MFR - a for the indi - cated periods of time , washed on ice and treated with neuraminidase to distinguish internalized from noninter - nalized MFR - a . Next the cells were lysed in Triton X - 100 in the absence or the presence of 0 . 2 % saponin and the ly - sates were applied to isoelectric focussing ( IEF ) gels . The results are shown in Fig . 6 . Again only 33 % of MFR - a was solubilized in the absence of saponin . Without chase , treatment of the cells with neuraminidase resulted in a complete shift of all isoforms of MFR - a to higher iso - electric points . After 1 h of chase a maximum of 12 . 3 % _ + 2 . 8 ( n = 3 ) MFR - a had become resistant to the neuramini - dase treatment , indicating these molecules had been inter - nalized during incubation of the cells at 37°C . The amount of internalized MFR - a was independent of the presence of saponin during lysis of the cells , showing that endocytosis was limited to the MFR - a molecules soluble in Triton X - 100 in the absence of saponin . We conclude that MFR - a present in Triton X - 100 - insoluble membrane domains did not par - ticipate in the internalization . When the protocol of the experiment was changed by cross - linking Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys with UV - light after the internalization of MFR - a at 37°C identical results were obtained , as was the case when lactoperoxidase - mediated cell surface - iodination of the cells followed by immunoprecipitation of MFR - a was used , showing that neither absence nor cross - linking of the ligand to MFR - a interferes with its trafficking ( data not The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 132 , 1996 40 Figure 6 . Endocytosis of MFR - u . KB cells were labeled with Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys and irradiated with UV - light to co - valently link the ligand to MFR - m Next the cells were allowed to internal - ize MFR - a for the indicated periods of time ( hours ) , washed on ice and treated with ( + ) or without ( - ) neuraminidase to distinguish internal - ized and noninternalized MFR - a . The cells were lysed as in Triton X - 100 in the absence ( - ) or presence ( + ) of 0 . 2 % saponin and the lysates were ap - plied to isoelectric focussing gels with a linear pH - range from 3 . 9 to 8 . 8 . shown ) . In a separate experiment in which cells labeled with Pte - [ 12SI ] ASA - Lys were allowed to internalize MFR - e ~ at 37°C for 4 h and subsequently analyzed on sucrose flota - tion gradients these data were confirmed ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . When extracellularly bound ligands were removed by an acidic wash of the cells after the incubation at 37°C , only a small amount of MFR - ot was found at the bottom of the gradient ( Fig . 4 D ) , again showing that internalized MFR - ct was soluble in Triton X - 100 . Internalized MFR - a Recycles to the Plasma Membrane Recycling of MFR - t ~ was studied by cell - fractionation on Percoll density gradients . KB cells were labeled with Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys as above , washed and allowed to internalize MFR - a at 37°C for 2 h . Due to the high affinity of folic acid / Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys for MFR - et intracellular dissocia - tion of Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys from MFR - a during endocytosis is thought to be negligible ( Kamen et al . , 1988 ) . Subse - quently noninternalized ligand was removed by an acidic wash and internalized ligand was cross - linked to the recep - tor at 0°C by irradiation of the cells with UV - light . Intra - cellular Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys - labeled MFR - cx was allowed to recycle at 37°C for the indicated periods of time . Postnu - clear supernatants were prepared and fractionated on Per - coll gradients . Fig . 7 A shows the distribution of total cell associated Pte - [ 12SI ] ASA - Lys - labeled MFR - e ~ after binding and in - ternalization of Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys ( open squares ) . After surface - associated Pte - [ a25I ] ASA - Lys had been removed by an acidic wash , the internalized MFR - a distributed at steady state in two overlapping peaks ( fractions 3 and 5 ; solid squares ) . Subtraction of these curves showed that the plasma membrane fractionated in the middle of the gradi - ent ( fractions 5 - 6 - 7 ) . Fig . 7 , B - G show that during the in - cubation of cells at 37°C , internalized MFR - et was slowly but progressively transported from the intracellular pool in fraction 3 to the plasma membrane in fraction 6 ( solid squares ) , when compared to the intracellular distribution at steady state ( open squares ) . In a parallel experiment in which the irradiation of the cells with UV - light was per - formed after the chase incubation at 37°C ( i . e . , after recy - cling ) , identical distributions for recycling MFR - et were found ( data not shown ) . This again indicated that cross - linking of Pte - [ 125I ] ASA - Lys to MFR - tx did not interfere with its intracellular transport . However , this procedure allowed the release of ligands bound to recycled MFR - ~ x by an acidic wash after the chase period ( Fig . 7 / / ) . It shows that part of MFR - ct had recycled to the plasma membrane . However , the majority of internalized , Pte - p25I ] ASA - Lys - labeled MFR - ct was retained in intracellu - lar compartments ( Fig . 7 H ) and was not triggered to recy - cle to the plasma membrane by longer chase periods ( not shown ) . We conclude that part of the internalized MFR - et recycles slowly to the plasma membrane whereas the ma - jority remains in intracellular compartments and is pre - sumably degraded . Since previous experiments had shown that only Triton X - 100 soluble MFR - et participated in endocytosis , we de - termined the Triton X - 100 solubility of recycling MFR - c ~ on sucrose flotation gradients at all chase times used in Fig . 7 . Therefore , Triton X - 100 was added to fractions 2 - 3 - 4 ( Fig . 8 , A and C ) or fractions 6 - 7 - 8 ( Fig . 8 , B and D ) of the Percoll gradients to a final concentration of 1 % and the ly - sates of the pooled fractions were applied to sucrose flota - tion gradients as the cell lysates in Fig . 4 . The results of two of these experiments are shown in Fig . 8 . After a chase of 5 min ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) and after a chase of 60 min ( Fig . 8 , C and D ) , as well as at the other periods of time ( not shown ) , more than 90 % of MFR - o ~ was recovered at the bottom of the gradient . This indicates that MFR - et re - mained soluble in Triton X - 100 during its recycling to the plasma membrane and that movement of MFR - a from the Triton X - 100 soluble pool to the Triton X - 100 insoluble pool only occurred very slowly . Immunoelectron Microscopy Finally , the intracellular distribution of MFR - et in KB cells was examined using immunolocalization in the electron - microscope . The cells were fixed and ultrathin cryosec - tions were immunolabeled for MFR - oL . Fig . 9 A shows abundant homogeneous labeling for MFR - c ~ at the plasma membrane and in budding vesicles . The relative distribu - tion of MFR - a immunoreactive sites ( Table I ) showed that almost 90 % of the receptor is present at the cell sur - face . Based on morphological criteria , caveolae were de - tected only incidentally in KB cells . Most of the budding vesicles at the plasma membrane were clathrin - coated pits , which colabeled for MFR - et ( Fig . 9 B ) . 9 . 3 % of MFR - c ~ was also found in a variety of large and small endosomes ( Fig . 9 , C and D ) . Only 2 % of the MFR - et immunoreactive Rijnboutt et al .

Taken together , the present study provides evidence that only small amounts of MFR - ct are slowly internalized and recycled to the plasma membrane by KB cells . Inter - nalized MFR - ot has access to the entire endocytic appara - tus , probably after internalization by clathrin - coated vesi - cles . MFR - ct present in large Triton X - 100 - insoluble membrane domains remain at the plasma membrane . Discussion In the present study the biosynthesis and endocytosis of MFR - ot and its recycling to the plasma membrane were studied with respect to its partial insolubility in the deter - gent Triton X - 100 , as found for other GPI - linked proteins ( Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ; Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Sargia - como et al . , 1993 ; Fiedler et al . , 1993 ; Chang et al . , 1994 ) . We found that 65 - 70 % of MFR - et becomes insoluble dur - ing biosynthetic transport to the plasma membrane , prob - ably in the Golgi complex . At the plasma membrane only soluble MFR - a participates in endocytosis . Internalized MFR - a remains soluble in Triton X - 100 , also after MFR - a has recycled to the plasma membrane . Internalization of MFR - e ~ and its recycling to the plasma membrane were limited to only 10 - 15 % of MFR - a present at the cell sur - face . This is in good agreement with the quantitative im - munoelectron microscopy , in which 87 % of the MFR - et was found at the cell surface and only 10 % in the en - docytic compartments . The molecular basis for the distribution of GPI - linked proteins in two pools characterized by their differential solubilization in detergents such as Triton X - 100 is not well understood . Intramolecular differences of GPI - linked proteins present in either one of these pools have not been detected . This study shows that the distribution over these two pools is independent of the binding of ligand to GPI - linked MFR - ct . As several groups have already indicated , we conclude that the microenvironment of these proteins must be responsible for the solubilization characteristics of these proteins . This was indicated by the complete solubi - lization of MFR - ct after the addition of the cholesterol complexing agent saponin to the Triton X - 100 , indicating a key role for cholesterol in the integrity of insoluble mem - brane domains ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 ; Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Cerneus et al . , 1993 ) . Glycosphingolipids have also been suggested to be a critical constituent of Triton X - 100 - insoluble microdomains ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . The ho - mogeneous labeling for MFR - et at the plasma membrane as detected in our immunoelectronmicroscopy , suggested the presence of small rather than large insoluble mem - brane domains . The possibility that the formation of large insoluble domains is induced during solubilization in Tri - ton X - 100 by clustering of individual GPI - linked proteins or small insoluble domains cannot be excluded . Since only part of the GPI - linked proteins becomes trapped in these domains , the fact remains that there must still be a differ - ence leading to the differential solubilization . These bio - chemically defined microdomains share many characteris - tics of the morphologically defined caveolae , however , differences in composition due to the methodology used cannot be excluded . Almost 90 % of total cell - associated MFR - a was homo - geneously distributed at the plasma membrane . MFR - a was found to colocalize with clathrin in coated pits . A sim - ilar localization has been observed for the GPI - linked a2 - macroglobulin receptor ( Nykjzer et al . , 1992 ) . In addition , neuroblastoma cells lacking caveolae and caveolin have been reported to internalize a glycolipid - anchored prion protein via clathrin - coated pits and vesicles ( Shyng et al . , 1994 ) . This is in contrast with the observation that GPI - linked proteins are excluded from clathrin - coated pits ( Le - mansky et al . , 1990 ) . MFR - a was also detected along the entire endocytic pathway using immunoelectronmicros - copy . These observations are in contrast with the localiza - tion of MFR - et described by Rothberg et al . ( 1990 ) in MA104 monkey kidney cells . These authors found MFR - a uniquely in large clusters in caveolae at the plasma mem - brane . Such large clusters of MFR - a in caveolae were not detected in prefixed KB cells . On the other hand , cell sur - face immunolabeling of unfixed KB cells resulted in large clusters of MFR - et at the plasma membrane , which only occasionally colocalized with caveolae ( data not shown ) .

Endocytic compartment : Small tubulo - vesicular structures , endosomes , multivesicular endosomes .

Miscellaneous vesicles : Vesicles which could not be assigned to one of the previously defined categories . This is in good agreement with the study of Mayor et al . ( 1994 ) , in which the authors showed that the clustering of MFR - a in monkey kidney MA104 cells was induced by the application of the anti - MFR antibody to the cell surface of unfixed cells . Therefore , the different localizations of MFR - a found by the different groups arise from differ - ences in the methods used . Triton X - 10 ( Oinsoluble membrane domains have been suggested to represent caveolae , which are enriched in GPI - linked proteins ( Fiedler et al . , 1993 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ) including MFR - ct ( this study ) . Caveolae have been proposed to function in the uptake of folates in a process which has been termed potocytosis . In this process folates are concentrated by the clustering of folate recep - tors in caveolae , which close without pinching off and sub - sequently acidify causing the folates to dissociate from the receptors . The folates would then enter the cytosol by the action of an as yet unidentified folate transporter ( Roth - berg et al . , 1990 ; Anderson , 1993a ) . The RFC has been shown to be capable of translocating folates across the membrane into the cytosol . In our experiments the RFC distributes on the bottom of the sucrose flotation gradients and is excluded from the detergent resistant membrane domains . This indicates that the RFC is not a likely candi - date to act in tandem with MFR - ot in caveolae to translo - cate folates into the cytosol . The RFC has been shown to be capable of translocating folates directly at the plasma membrane without an obligatory concentration of the vi - tamin by MFRs before translocation ( Sirotnak , 1985 ; Jan - sen et al . , 1990b ) , even under conditions where folate up - take via MFR - et was blocked ( Westerhof et al . , 1991 , 1994 ) . In addition , several cell lines have been identified which lack MFRs but express an active RFC , such as the CEM - 7A cells used in this study . On the other hand , the fact that cells can survive by means of a GPI - linked folate receptor is illustrated by a previous study in which human leukemia cells with a defective RFC were shown to grow under nanomolar concentrations of folates ( Jansen et al . , 1989b ) . Therefore , it has been proposed that the RFC is the preferred folate - uptake system in cells that express both systems ( Westerhof et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) , although cells lacking the RFC can accumulate sufficient amounts of folates to grow by means of MFRs . The fact that MFR - a has a GPI anchor opens the possi - bility for a role in signal transduction cascades , as has been suggested for other GPI - linked proteins such as Thy - 1 and Decay Accelerating Factor ( Stefanov ~ i et al . , 1991 ; Shenoy et al . , 1992 ; Thomas and Samuelson , 1992 ; Dr ~ iberov ~ and Drfiber , 1993 ) . GPI - anchored MFRs have also been impli - cated in signal transduction causing a proliferative re - sponse in hematopoietic progenitor cells ( Antony et al . , 1987 , 1991 ) and an increased transient uptake of Ca 2 + in Dictyostelium DiscoYdeum ( Milne and Coukell , 1991 ) . Re - cently , it has been suggested that caveolae function as a specialized region of the plasma membrane for Ca 2 + - homeo - stasis and signal transduction ( Anderson , 1993a , b ; Lisanti et al . , 1994b ) . In contrast to this hypothesis is the report by Fra et al . ( 1994 ) in which the authors show the presence of detergent - insoluble glycolipid domains in cells devoid of caveolae and caveolin . In conclusion , we feel that the role of GPI - linked MFRs in the uptake of ( anti - ) folates is subordinate to the role of the RFC . This does not alter the fact that MFRs can be used to introduce antifolate compounds ( ZD1694 , CB3717 , and DDATHF ) with high affinity for MFRs into neoplas - tic cells , such as in ovarian cancer in which MFR - et has been suggested to be a marker protein because of its con - stant high level of expression ( Campbell et al . , 1991 ) . The possible role of MFRs in signal transduction cascades in - volved in cell proliferation offers exciting new possibilities for investigation .
