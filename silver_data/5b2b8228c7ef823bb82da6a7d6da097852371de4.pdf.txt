letters nature structural biology • volume 5 number 9 • september 1998 787 Using a new procedure that combines electron - density corre - lation with biochemical information , we have fitted the crystal structure of the N - terminal actin - binding domain of human T - fimbrin to helical reconstructions of fimbrin - decorated actin filaments . The map locates the N - terminal calcium - bind - ing domain and identifies actin - binding site residues on the two calponin - homology domains of fimbrin . Based on this map , we propose a model of a fimbrin crosslink in an actin bundle and its regulation by calcium . The calponin - homology ( CH ) domain superfamily ( Fig . 1 ) is implicated in regulating the assembly and organization of the actin cytoskeleton through a highly conserved F - actin binding domain ( ABD ) 1 . The ABD , composed of a tandem pair of CH motifs , is found in actin crosslinking proteins such as fimbrin , a - actinin , spectrin , and dystrophin . These molecules are typically bifunctional homodimers , in which the ABDs lie at the ends of long molecules , and thus direct the organization of individual actin filaments into two - and three - dimensional networks . In contrast , the two ABDs ( ABD1 , ABD2 ) of fimbrin are tandemly arranged on the same polypeptide and thus organize actin into bundles of tightly packed filaments 2 – 6 . Recent evidence suggests a more general organizing function for the ABD . Intermediate filament binding proteins , such as plectin , dystonin , and BPAG1n1 , contain a functional ABD , sug - gesting a role for this domain in coordinating the assembly of the actin and intermediate filament cytoskeletons 7 , 8 . Also , a single CH domain is found in proteins that are involved in modulating signal transduction mechanisms associated with Rac / Rho - depen - dent pathways . G - protein signaling proteins such as vav and IQGAP1 are localized to the actin cytoskeleton through single CH domains 1 , 9 . Interestingly , vav becomes an oncogenic transform - ing factor when it’s CH domain is deleted 10 . Thus , the CH domain serves to integrate signaling and cytoskeletal systems . Because the CH domain plays an important and varied role in organizing many aspects of the cytoskeletal function , it is impor - tant to understand the structural basis of CH - domain binding to actin . We have adopted fimbrin as a model system to study the structure and function of the CH - domain actin interaction . Fimbrin contains an N - terminal calcium - binding domain ( residues 1 – 100 ) followed by a tandem pair of ABDs ( ABD1 and ABD2 ) . Each of these ABDs contains two CH domains ( CH1 , CH1 ' , CH2 , and CH2 ' respectively ) . Fimbrin crosslinks actin filaments through this tandem pair of ABDs . The actin bundling activity of fimbrin is inhibited by calcium 11 , 12 , indicating the importance of the N - terminal calcium binding domain . Previously , we determined the X - ray structure of ABD1 ( includ - ing residues 101 – 375 ) of human T - fimbrin 13 and an electron microscopy ( EM ) reconstruction of a larger domain , N375 ( including ABD1 and the N - terminal calcium domain ) bound to actin 14 . Difference mapping analysis lead to a preliminary model that revealed the shape of N375 and localized it’s binding inter - face with actin 14 . This model of actin - binding segments was sup - ported by crosslinking and genetic studies 15 , 16 . In this report , we combine these structural data to provide the first atomic work - ing model for CH - domain binding to actin and the location of the calcium - binding domain . Fitting analysis To refine our understanding of the actin – fimbrin interaction , we applied a new fitting analysis ( N . V . and D . H . , unpublished results ) using the atomic model of fimbrin ABD1 and the elec - tron density maps from electron cryomicroscopy . The main cri - terion was the correlation coefficient between the density of the N375 construct and the electron density calculated from the X - ray model of fimbrin ADB1 in the corresponding trial posi - tion . In addition to this density correlation , a contact function has been introduced that incorporates information from peptide and deletion studies and suppressor mutant analysis for several members of the CH - domain superfamily 17 – 21 . A search revealed a small area in parameter space that simultaneously maximizes the correlation and the contact function . The docking shown in Fig . 2 represents the best fit within this region . The correlation coefficient between the observed and the calculated electron densities is 92 . 7 % and the contact value indicates 46 % compati - bility with the included biochemical information . The mean root - mean - square deviation of the atom positions around this fit was 2 . 6 Å . The model shows that the binding surface on N375 is predominantly localized in CH1 and the connecting region between the two CH domains . The F - actin residues that are in proximity to N375 primarily reside within subdomain 2 of the lower actin subunit ( n ) and subdomain 1 of the upper actin subunit ( n + 2 ) ( see also Fig . 3 ) . The actin – fimbrin interface Residues involved in actin – fimbrin binding should be close to the area of the interface but independent of the orientation and position of the model within the con - strained region of parameter space . In order to evaluate interaction probabilities we employed a scoring scheme for the residues . Only residues that reside within 8 Å of the interface region and have a fractional accessible sur - face area greater than 0 . 1 in the crystal structure were considered as candidates for binding and therefore included in the calculation . All fitting parameters have been allowed to vary within parameter space , as long as the correlation coefficient was above 89 % and the con - tact function was above 0 . 33 . The results are summa - rized in Table 1 and Fig . 3 .

These polypeptide segments are consistent with most of actin - binding segments ABS2 and ABS3 which have been implicated in actin binding by peptide - binding and genetic studies 17 – 20 . In actin the most probable binding sites are found in subdomain 1 , especially close to the helix around residue 100 and the adjacent loop around residue 25 . This is consistent with genetic analysis in yeast , indicating that actin residues 99 / 100 are involved in the interaction with fimbrin 15 . The analysis shows that the CH1 domain plays a dominant role in binding . This observation is consistent with several other inde - pendent studies : ( i ) a fragment from a - actinin representing the N - terminal CH domain binds F - actin only an order of magnitude less tightly than the full length molecule 22 ; ( ii ) IQGAP1 , which contains a single CH domain , binds F - actin in vitro 23 ; ( iii ) isolated CH domains from spectrin and utrophin have been shown to be autonomously folding and stable actin - binding modules 24 , 25 ; ( iv ) calponin , which contains only a single CH domain , binds to F - actin with high affinity 26 ; ( v ) a difference density analysis of three - dimensional maps between calponin - decorated actin and actin 27 shows a feature that is roughly the size of a single CH domain located at the site identified with the CH1 - domain of N375 ( white grid superimposed in red solid representation of peak 1 in Fig . 4 b ) . Not only can the density of calponin be superimposed into the N - terminal CH domain of N375 , but both calponin and N375 induce similar conformational changes in actin subdomain 1 ( peak 2 in Fig . 4 b ; see also refs 14 , 27 ) . The close correspondence between the binding locations of the a - actinin , calponin and the fimbrin , and the similar conformational changes in actin are strong evidence that these CH - domain superfamily members bind actin through similar mechanisms . Model of a fimbrin crosslink The fitting analysis is also strengthened by it’s ability to explain how fimbrin can crosslink individual actin filaments separated by a 140 Å center - to - center spacing 28 . In the crystal structure , the N - and C - termini of the two CH domains point in opposite directions . In the docked model , the N - terminus faces the actin filament while the C - terminus faces away . This arrangement would place fimbrin’s second ABD ( ABD2 ) away from the fila - ment and in position to bind to a second filament , yielding the observed interfilament spacing . This model cannot predict the relative orientations of ABD1 and ABD2 . N - terminal calcium - binding domain Another important feature of the fitting analysis is the localiza - tion of an additional density close to the interface of the CH domains on the side facing away from the actin filament ( Fig . 2 a , b ) . We suggest this prominent peak , calculated from the dif - ference between the observed density of the EM reconstruction and calculated densities of the docked atomic model , is the cal - cium - binding domain ( residues 1 – 100 ) . Since the crystal struc - ture lacks this domain , the existence of this peak suggests its position . The volume of this difference peak can accommodate approximately one EF - hand motif which corresponds to half of the calcium - binding domain . The position of the N - terminus of ABD1 and the position of the difference peak between the observed and calculated densi - ties implies how the N - terminal calcium - binding domain inhibits fimbrin binding in the presence of calcium . The calci - um - binding domain occupies the crevice between the two CH domains . There it can act as a wedge between the two domains and disrupt actin binding to sites on the opposite face of the domain . Since the conformation of calmodulin - like calcium - binding domains is known to be dependent on the calcium a b Fig . 2 A representative fit of the fimbrin ( ABD1 ) crystal structure to the 3D reconstruction of the fimbrin – actin complex . a , A transverse slice through the N375 difference map ( red ) superimposed on the actin map ( blue ) , the atom - ic model of F - actin ( white ) , the ABD1 crystal structure ( green - cyan C a chain ) , and the actin – fimbrin interface ( purple ) .

This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that deletion of the N - terminal calcium - binding domain reduces the actin binding of ABD1 ( P . M . , unpublished results ) . Moreover , our interpretation is reinforced by the proteolytic pattern of fimbrin in the presence or absence of calcium ( Fig . 4 c ) . A hot spot for proteolysis , between the putative EF - hands and the ABD1 , becomes protease - resistant in the presence of calcium . Slower cleavage occurs at a site in the loop between a 3 ' and a 4 ' of CH1 ' . In our model , this site is located near the N - terminal calcium - binding domain . This loop is facing the crevice between the two CH domains , the suggested position of the calcium - binding domain in our model . Therefore , it is con - ceivable that the conformational change that lowers fimbrin ' s affinity to actin also protects this loop from proteolysis . Interestingly , ABD2 of fimbrin seems to be protected from pro - teolysis by the presence of ABD1 , as suggested in our crosslink model . The ability to perform a correlation - based search between calculated and observed electron densities allows an objective evaluation of parameter space . In this study we have combined biochemical and structural information in order to assign interaction probabilities to residues and structural elements involved in the binding of fimbrin to actin . The analysis also provides a putative location for the N - terminal calcium - bind - ing domain and suggests its role in regulating fimbrin - actin bundling . Furthermore the fitted map has implications for fila - ment crosslinking . The important role of biochemical informa - tion along with structural data is emphasized by the solution obtained in this work . Further refinement of the proposed binding sites should include biochemical as well as structural studies . Methods The three - dimensional maps used in this study were generated using electron cryomicroscopy and helical reconstruction . The full details of the reconstructions are described in ref . 14 for the fim - brin work and in ref . 27 for the calponin work . The details of the procedure used for determination of the 101 – 375 crystal structure is described in ref . 13 . Electron density maps and atomic models were displayed on an Iris Indigo R4000 XS24 device ( Silicon Graphics , Corp . , Mountain View , CA ) using O 30 and RASMOL 31 . We fitted the crystal structure of 101 – 375 to the difference map produced by subtracting the actin map from the map of actin decorated with N375 . The fitting of the atomic model of F - actin 32 to the prealigned EM - density maps was done manually using the program O . Fitting procedure . The fitting of the fimbrin ABD1 to the N375 peak was done by a novel algorithm that facilitates a fast six - dimen - sional density - correlation search with respect to translational and rotational parameters of the atomic model .

Only residues with a fractional accessible surface area of more than 0 . 1 and located within 8 Å of the actin filament have been considered in the calculation . We have investigated the effect of increasing as well as decreasing the contact distance . Between 6 Å and 10 Å we found only minute changes in the resulting scores . This is under - standable from the fact that only solvent accessible residues are included in the calculation . We settled for 8 Å because this value corresponded to the maximum root - mean - square deviation we found for any individual atom in the solution peak .

The search revealed a clear trans - lation peak ( Fig . 4 a , upper panel ) that is virtually independent of the orientation . However , the orientation could not be determined by correlation alone . The rotation around the axis parallel to the fil - ament ( z ) as well as the short axis of the N375 density ( x ) display a dual ambiguity and has two peaks 180° apart , whereas the correla - tion is almost insensitive to a rotation around the long axis ( y ) of the N375 density ( Fig . 4 a , lower panel ) . To resolve these ambiguities a contact function has been intro - duced that assigns scores for the compatibility with peptide and a Fig . 4 a , ( upper panel ) Translational scans along the axes of the N375 density . x is along the short axis perpendicular to the actin filament axis . A positive translation in x corresponds to moving the ABD1 model towards the filament . y is along the long axis perpendicular to the filament axis .

A positive translation in z corresponds to mov - ing the ABD1 model up the filament ( see insert ) . The origin was chosen to be the center - of - mass position of the fitted model shown in Fig . 2 .

A total score of one means all surface accessible residues predicted by the biochemical experiments are in contact for that model orientation and position . A search with respect to translation and rotation was performed using the contact function as well as density correlation ( Fig . 4 a ) . The correlation maxima of the rotations around the x and the z axis of the N375 density can be easily distinguished on the basis of the contact function . It also displays a clear sensitivity to a rotation around the y axis giving a peak of 0 . 46 ( 3 . 3 s of y - rotation distribu - tion ) . The correlation coefficient is 0 . 927 in this orientation . However , a degree of freedom in all six parameters is apparent from this analysis . We assigned solutions that simultaneously have a cor - relation coefficient greater than 0 . 89 and a contact value greater than 0 . 33 ( 2 s of y - rotation distribution ) as acceptable . A search sub - ject to these constraints lead to 539 solutions that are equally acceptable according to the distributions of the correlation co - efficients as well as the contact function . The docking shown in Fig . 2 represents the best fit within this region . These solutions have been used to identify the residues likely to be involved in the actin – fimbrin interaction . Residues that are in contact for all 539 solutions have been assigned a score of one , residues in con - tact for half of these solutions have been assigned a score of 0 . 5 and so on . The results are summarized in Fig . 3 and Table 1 . Difference mapping . For the localization of the N - terminal calci - um - binding domain , a difference map has been calculated using the N375 density and the density calculated from the best fit mentioned above . This map was contoured at a level of 3 s above mean , reveal - ing one single peak ( Fig . 2 b ) . The calcium - free NMR structure of Xenopus laevis calmodulin 33 has been used to evaluate the size of the structural element that could be accommodated by this differ - ence peak . Although the peak is too small for the whole calmodulin molecule , the largest part of each of the EF - hands fits quite easily ( data not shown ) . Acknowledgments D . H . and N .
