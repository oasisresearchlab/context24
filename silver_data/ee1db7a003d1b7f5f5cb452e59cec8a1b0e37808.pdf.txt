Lanes 1 and 2 are silver stained , lanes 3 - 9 fluorescent pictures . 3 Galectin - 3 labeling studies in presence of protein mixture II Selectivity of probe 1 for galectin - 3 in presence of protein mixture II 4 Monovalent probe 3 concentration - dependent labeling studies . Figure 3 Galectin - 3 labeling studies with variation of Galectin - 3 quantity at 5 μ M monovalent probe 3 or divalent probe 1 . Labeling studies with variation of Galectin - 3 quantity ( probe 3 ) . An aliquot of 5 μ L of monovalent probe 3 ( 50 μ M in water ) or 1 ( 50 μ M in water : DMSO 20 : 1 ) was added to varying amounts of galectin - 3 ( 20 , 10 , 5 , 2 . 5 , 1 . 1 μ L of 125 μ g / mL stock solution and 2 . 8 μ L of a 12 . 5 μ g / mL stock solution respectively ) , and the total volume was adjusted to 50 μ L in HEPES buffer . The samples were then photoincubated , “clicked” to the fluorescent dye 2 , loaded onto the gel and visualized as described above . The experiments for probe 1 were performed similarly . 5 MALDI spectrum of the excised protein band indicated in figure 2 , lane 6 .
