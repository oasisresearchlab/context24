Vol . 214 No . 4 475 – 489 www . jcb . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201503123 Introduction Cell motility plays a central role in various biological processes , including embryogenesis , immune surveillance , and wound healing , with spatiotemporal regulation of such motility being essential for homeostasis in multicellular organisms ( Lauffen - burger and Horwitz , 1996 ) . Cell motility is induced by multiple extracellular cues , including gradients of chemokines , growth factors , and extracellular matrix components . These molecules engage cell surface receptors and thereby initiate a cascade of events such as activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) and extracellular signal – regulated kinase ( ERK ) signal - ing pathways that function downstream of the small GTP - bind - ing protein Ras ( Guo and Giancotti , 2004 ) . Activated PI3K catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphos - phate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) , which triggers the formation of lamelli - podia at the leading edge of a migrating cell via activation of the small GTPase Rac1 and the protein kinase Akt and thereby promotes cell motility ( Raftopoulou and Hall , 2004 ; Vanhaese - broeck et al . , 2012 ; Xue and Hemmings , 2013 ) . Activated ERK also modulates cell motility through direct phosphoryla - tion of several molecules , including myosin light chain kinase ( Klemke et al . , 1997 ) , cortactin ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) , WAVE2 ( Danson et al . , 2007 ; Nakanishi et al . , 2007 ; Mendoza et al . , 2011 ) , and FAK ( Hunger - Glaser et al . , 2003 ) . We recently showed that the Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain – containing pro - tein SH3P2 is a negative regulator of cell motility whose func - tion is abrogated by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) – mediated phosphorylation at Ser 202 downstream of ERK ( Tanimura et al . , 2011 ) . However , the mechanism by which SH3P2 regulates cell motility has remained elusive . Myosin 1E ( Myo1E ) is an actin - dependent molecular motor that is widely expressed in vertebrate tissues ( McCon - nell and Tyska , 2010 ) . Myo1E is a class 1 myosin , a defining feature of which is the ability to interact with both cell mem - branes and actin filaments via a C - terminal tail homology 1 ( TH1 ) domain and an N - terminal motor domain , respectively . This spatial segregation of membrane and actin - binding sites suggests that class 1 myosins have the potential to serve as diva - lent cross - linking proteins that physically connect and generate force between actin filaments and membranes and thereby to regulate plasma membrane tension . Whereas most class 1 myo - sins are “short tailed” in that they possess only the TH1 domain in the tail region , Myo1E also contains a proline - rich membrane binding ( TH2 ) domain and a protein – protein interaction ( SH3 ) domain and is therefore classified as “long tailed . ” Myo1E has been proposed to function in a manner dependent on interac - tions mediated by its SH3 domain as a transporter or recruiter of effector proteins involved in myosin - based as well as actin nucleation – based force generation at the plasma membrane . It Signaling by extracellular signal – regulated kinase ( ERK ) plays an essential role in the induction of cell motility , but the precise mechanism underlying such regulation has remained elusive . We recently identified SH3P2 as a negative regu - lator of cell motility whose function is inhibited by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase ( RSK ) – mediated phosphorylation down - stream of ERK . We here show that myosin 1E ( Myo1E ) is a binding partner of SH3P2 and that the interaction of the two proteins in the cytosol prevents the localization of Myo1E to the plasma membrane . Serum - induced phosphorylation of SH3P2 at Ser 202 by RSK results in dissociation of Myo1E from SH3P2 in the cytosol and the subsequent localization of Myo1E to the tips of lamellipodia mediated by binding of its TH2 domain to F - actin . This translocation of Myo1E is es - sential for lamellipodium extension and consequent cell migration . The ERK signaling pathway thus promotes cell motility through regulation of the subcellular localization of Myo1E .

However , the molecular mechanisms by which the function of Myo1E , and in particular its intracellular local - ization , are regulated have remained unknown . We have now identified Myo1E as a binding partner of SH3P2 . We found that RSK - mediated phosphorylation of SH3P2 induces the dissocia - tion of Myo1E from SH3P2 in the cytosol , which results in the localization of Myo1E to the tips of lamellipodia and thereby promotes cell motility . Results Identification of Myo1E as a binding partner of SH3P2 To identify proteins that interact with SH3P2 , we performed a pull - down assay with MKN1 cell lysates and a GST - SH3P2 fu - sion protein as the bait . An ∼ 120 - kD protein was found to bind specifically to SH3P2 ( Fig . 1 A ) and was identified by mass spectrometry ( MS ) as Myo1E . Specific interaction between endogenous SH3P2 and Myo1E was confirmed by recipro - cal coimmunoprecipitation assays ( Fig . 1 B ) . The pull - down assay also revealed the binding of ∼ 66 - and ∼ 68 - kD proteins to SH3P2 , and these two proteins were identified by MS as hnRNP - K and Sam68 , respectively . However , given that coim - munoprecipitation assays did not detect a specific interaction between endogenous SH3P2 and either of these two RNA - bind - ing proteins ( Fig . 1 B ) , we did not analyze them further . SH3P2 interacts with Myo1E via its N - terminal proline - rich region and C - terminal acidic amino acid cluster SH3P2 consists of an N - terminal proline - rich ( PR ) region , an SH3 domain , three ankyrin ( ANK ) repeats , and a C - terminal ( C ) region ( Fig . 2 A ) . To determine the region of SH3P2 re - sponsible for interaction with Myo1E , we first performed pull - down assays with MKN1 cell lysates and GST - fused SH3P2 deletion mutants as baits . We found that SH3P2 ( Δ PR ) and SH3P2 ( Δ PR / SH3 ) as well as SH3P2 ( Δ C ) interacted with en - dogenous Myo1E , albeit to a slightly or substantially reduced extent compared with wild - type SH3P2 , respectively , whereas neither SH3P2 ( Δ PR / C ) nor SH3P2 ( Δ PR / ANK / C ) showed such an interaction ( Fig . 2 A ) . Coimmunoprecipitation analysis with lysates of MKN1 cells expressing EGFP - tagged SH3P2 dele - tion mutants showed that deletion of the PR / SH3 or C regions attenuated the interaction of SH3P2 with Myo1E slightly or substantially , respectively , and that deletion of both PR and C regions abolished the interaction ( Fig . 2 B ) . The SH3P2 proteins of various mammalian species con - tain a conserved acidic amino acid cluster at the C terminus ( Fig . S1 A ) , whose potential role in the interaction with Myo1E we next examined . Coimmunoprecipitation analysis with ly - sates of MKN1 cells expressing EGFP - tagged SH3P2 ( Δ C2 ) , SH3P2 ( Δ C1 ) , or SH3P2 ( Δ C ) revealed that the extent of in - teraction of these mutants with endogenous Myo1E decreased as the number of deleted acidic amino acid residues increased ( Fig . 2 B ) . Furthermore , replacement of two ( C2A mutant : Asp 209 / Asp 210 ) or six ( C6A mutant : Glu 205 / Asp 206 / Asp 209 / Asp 210 / Glu 211 / Asp 212 ) acidic amino acid residues of SH3P2 with ala - nine reduced the extent of association with Myo1E slightly or markedly , respectively ( Fig . 2 B ) . Together , these results sug - gested that both the PR region and the C - terminal acidic amino acid cluster , but not the SH3 domain or ANK repeats , of SH3P2 are required for efficient interaction with Myo1E . Myo1E interacts with SH3P2 via its SH3 domain and the C - terminal positively charged region of its TH2 domain Myo1E comprises an actin - activated motor head domain , a light - chain binding neck ( IQ ) domain , as well as TH1 , TH2 , and SH3 domains ( Fig . 3 A ) . To determine the region of Myo1E responsible for interaction with SH3P2 , we first examined the potential interaction between the SH3 domain of Myo1E and the PR region of SH3P2 , given that SH3 domains recognize PR sequences within specific peptide sequence contexts ( Ren et al . , 1993 ; Feng et al . , 1994 ) . A pull - down assay with the GST - fused SH3 domain of Myo1E as bait showed that Myo1E ( SH3 ) bound to recombinant SH3P2 , but not to SH3P2 ( Δ PR ) ( Fig . 3 A ) , sug - gesting that the SH3 domain of Myo1E indeed contributes to the interaction with SH3P2 by binding to its PR region . Coimmunoprecipitation analysis with lysates of MKN1 cells expressing EGFP - tagged Myo1E deletion mutants revealed that although deletion of the SH3 domain alone did not substan - tially affect the binding of Myo1E to endogenous SH3P2 , deletion of TH1 – TH2 - SH3 or TH2 - SH3 domains abolished such binding ( Fig . 3 B ) , suggesting the presence of another binding site ( or sites ) within the TH2 domain . Seven basic amino acids are clus - tered in the C - terminal region of the TH2 domain , which is con - served among mammalian Myo1E proteins ( Fig . S1 B ) . We next Figure 1 . SH3P2 specifically interacts with Myo1E . ( A ) Glutathione - Sepharose beads coupled with GST or GST - SH3P2 were incubated with MKN1 cell lysates ( + ) or with the lysis buffer alone ( − ) , after which bead - bound proteins were subjected to SDS - PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue ( CBB ) . Bands corresponding to proteins of ∼ 120 , ∼ 68 , and ∼ 66 kD ( arrows ) pulled down by GST - SH3P2 were identified by MS analysis as Myo1E , Sam68 , and hnRNP - K , respectively . ( B ) MKN1 cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with antibodies to SH3P2 or to Myo1E ( or with control IgG ) , and the resulting precipitates as well as the whole - cell lysates ( 10 % of the input for immunoprecipitation ) were subjected to immunoblot analysis ( IB ) with antibodies to the indicated proteins . All data are representative of at least three separate experiments . erK signaling regulates localization of myo1e • Tanimura et al . 477 focused on the potential role of these basic amino acid residues in the interaction of Myo1E with SH3P2 . Coimmunoprecipitation analysis with lysates of MKN1 cells expressing EGFP - tagged Myo1E mutants revealed that deletion of sequences containing all seven ( Δ TH2 - b2 / SH3 mutant : Arg 1029 / Arg 1030 / Arg 1035 / Arg 1042 / Lys 1044 / Lys 1048 / Lys 1050 ) or the final four ( Δ TH2 - b1 / SH3 mutant : Arg 1042 / Lys 1044 / Lys 1048 / Lys 1050 ) of these basic amino acid resi - dues abrogated the interaction of Myo1E ( Δ SH3 ) with SH3P2 ( Fig . 3 B ) . Furthermore , replacement of Lys 1048 and Lys 1050 with alanine ( 2A Δ SH3 mutant ) reduced the extent of the interaction between Myo1E ( Δ SH3 ) and SH3P2 ( Fig . 3 B ) . These results suggested that the positively charged region located at the C terminus of the TH2 domain also contributes to the interaction of Myo1E with SH3P2 , most likely through binding to the acidic amino acid cluster of the latter protein . To confirm the presence of these two binding inter - faces for the interaction between SH3P2 and Myo1E , we per - formed pull - down assays with MKN1 cell lysates expressing EGFP - tagged Myo1E deletion mutants and with GST - fused SH3P2 deletion mutants as baits . As expected , SH3P2 bound to Myo1E and to Myo1E ( Δ SH3 ) , but not to Myo1E ( Δ TH2 - b2 / SH3 ) . SH3P2 ( Δ PR ) , which possesses the C - terminal acidic amino acid cluster , bound to Myo1E and to Myo1E ( Δ SH3 ) , but not to Myo1E ( Δ TH2 - b2 / SH3 ) . SH3P2 ( Δ C ) , which possesses the PR region , bound to Myo1E , but not to Myo1E ( Δ SH3 ) or Myo1E ( Δ TH2 - b2 / SH3 ) . Finally , SH3P2 ( Δ PR / C ) failed to bind to Myo1E , Myo1E ( Δ SH3 ) , or Myo1E ( Δ TH2 - b2 / SH3 ) ( Fig . 3 C and Fig . S2 ) . RSK - mediated phosphorylation of SH3P2 at Ser 202 induces dissociation of Myo1E We previously showed that RSK1 , acting downstream of the ERK pathway , phosphorylates SH3P2 at Ser 202 and thereby in - hibits its ability to suppress cell motility ( Tanimura et al . , 2011 ) .

( A ) Glutathione - Sepharose beads coupled with GST or GST - tagged wild - type or indicated mutant forms of human SH3P2 were incubated with MKN1 cell lysates , after which bead - bound proteins as well as the whole - cell lysates ( 10 % of the input for the pull - down assays ) were subjected to SDS - PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue ( CBB ) or immunoblot analysis ( IB ) with antibodies to Myo1E .

The result - ing precipitates as well as the whole - cell lysates ( 10 % of the input for immunoprecipitation ) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Myo1E and to GFP . Amino acid sequences of the PR region and the C - terminal acidic amino acid cluster are shown .

All data are representative of at least three separate experiments . JCB • Volume 214 • NumBer 4 • 2016 478 This serine residue is located in the C - terminal region of SH3P2 , which is required for the interaction with Myo1E ( Fig . 2 B ) . We therefore examined whether RSK - mediated phosphorylation of SH3P2 affects its interaction with Myo1E . Coimmunoprecipitation assays with antibodies to SH3P2 and to Myo1E revealed an inverse relation between the extent of SH3P2 phosphorylation ( resulting from ERK pathway acti - vation ) and the extent of SH3P2 interaction with Myo1E in sev - eral tumor cell lines ( Fig . 4 A ) . Marked association of these two proteins was thus observed in HeLa S3 ( 78 . 7 ± 11 . 6 % of Myo1E in cell lysates was associated with SH3P2 ) and MKN1 ( 78 . 4 ± 6 . 8 % ) cells , in which the activity of the ERK pathway is limited ( Hoshino et al . , 1999 ) . Stimulation of these cells with serum , however , induced SH3P2 phosphorylation and reduced the level Figure 3 .

( A ) Glutathione - Sepharose beads coupled with GST - fused human Myo1E ( SH3 ) were incubated with recombinant human SH3P2 or SH3P2 ( Δ PR ) , after which bead - bound proteins as well as recombinant SH3P2 or SH3P2 ( Δ PR ) ( 10 % of the input for the pull - down assay ) were subjected to SDS - PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue ( CBB ) or immunoblot analysis ( IB ) with antibodies to SH3P2 . ( B ) MKN1 cells were transfected for 24 h with vectors encoding EGFP - tagged wild - type or indicated mutant forms of human Myo1E , lysed , and subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with antibodies to GFP . The resulting precipitates as well as the whole - cell lysates ( 10 % of the input for immunoprecipitation ) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to SH3P2 and to GFP . The amino acid sequence of the C - terminal positively charged region of the TH2 domain of Myo1E is shown , with acidic amino acids , basic amino acids , and proline being indicated in red , blue , and green , respectively . ( C ) MKN1 cells were transfected for 24 h with vectors encoding EGFP - tagged wild - type or mutant forms of human Myo1E , lysed , and subjected to pull - down assays with GST or GST - fused wild - type or mutant forms of human SH3P2 . Bead - bound proteins as well as the whole - cell lysates ( 10 % of the input for the pull - down assays ) were subjected to SDS - PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue or by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to GFP . All data are representative of at least three separate experiments . erK signaling regulates localization of myo1e • Tanimura et al . 479 of SH3P2 – Myo1E interaction within 10 min ( 22 . 4 ± 3 . 9 % in MKN1 cells ) ; both of these effects were partially reversed at 120 min after the onset of stimulation , and they were prevented by prior exposure of the cells to PD184352 , an inhibitor of the ERK kinase MEK . In contrast , only a low level of SH3P2 – Myo1E in - teraction ( 6 . 1 ± 2 . 1 % ) was apparent in MDA - MB - 231 cells , in which the ERK pathway is constitutively activated ( Hoshino et al . , 1999 ) , and treatment of these cells with PD184352 induced dephosphorylation of SH3P2 and increased the association be - tween these two proteins ( 17 . 1 ± 4 . 0 % ) . The unphosphorylatable mutant SH3P2 ( S202A ) showed marked association with Myo1E in HeLa S3 cells , and serum stimulation of these cells did not induce the dissocia - tion of Myo1E from SH3P2 ( S202A ) ( Fig . 4 B ) . Furthermore , SH3P2 ( S202A ) , but not wild - type SH3P2 , also showed a high level of association with Myo1E in MDA - MB - 231 and HT - 1080 cells , in the latter of which the ERK pathway is also constitu - tively activated ( Hoshino et al . , 1999 ) . Finally , serum - induced cell motility in MKN1 and HeLa S3 cells and the enhanced basal level of motility in MDA - MB - 231 cells were markedly attenuated by PD184352 ( Fig . 4 C ) . Together , these results in - dicated that RSK - mediated phosphorylation of SH3P2 at Ser 202 induces the dissociation of Myo1E from SH3P2 , with this dis - sociation being required for the induction of cell motility . Myo1E localizes to lamellipodial tips after dissociation from SH3P2 Both Myo1E and SH3P2 were localized to the cytosol of se - rum - deprived MKN1 cells ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Serum stimulation of the cells induced rapid translocation of Myo1E to sites of actin polymerization in lamellipodia , which define the tips of these structures ( Fig . 5 A ) , whereas it had no substantial effect on the subcellular localization of SH3P2 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Activation of both the ERK and PI3K signaling pathways is required for the induction of actin polymerization and subse - quent lamellipodium formation ( Wennström et al . , 1994 ; Weiger et al . , 2009 ; Mendoza et al . , 2011 ; Vanhaesebroeck et al . , 2012 ) . Prior treatment of MKN1 cells with PD184352 thus inhibited the serum - induced formation of lamellipodia and suppressed the translocation of Myo1E to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5 A ) . Figure 4 . RSK - mediated phosphorylation of SH3P2 at Ser 202 induces the dissociation of Myo1E from SH3P2 . ( A ) MKN1 or HeLa S3 cells were deprived of serum for 12 h , incubated with or without 10 µM PD184352 for 30 min , and then stimulated with 10 % FBS for the indicated times . Exponentially growing MDA - MB - 231 cells were incubated with or without 10 µM PD184352 for 4 h . Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with antibodies to SH3P2 or to Myo1E , and the resulting precipitates as well as the whole - cell lysates ( 10 % of the input for immunoprecipitation ) were subjected to immunoblot analysis ( IB ) with antibodies to the indicated proteins . ( B ) HeLa S3 , MDA - MB - 231 , or HT - 1080 cells were transfected for 24 h with vectors for EGFP - SH3P2 or EGFP - SH3P2 ( S202A ) , and the transfected HeLa S3 cells were then deprived of serum for 12 h before stimulation with 10 % FBS for 10 min . Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Myo1E , and the resulting precipitates as well as the whole - cell lysates ( 10 % of the input for immunoprecipitation ) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the indicated proteins . ( C ) The motility of MKN1 , HeLa S3 , or MDA - MB - 231 cells was measured with a transwell migration assay for 6 h in the absence or presence of 10 % FBS , 10 µM PD184352 , or 10 µM LY294002 as indicated . The numbers of cells that had migrated to reach the lower surface of the filter were 212 ± 20 , 63 ± 14 , and 177 ± 26 for FBS - stim - ulated MKN1 , HeLa S3 , and MDA - MB - 231 cells , respectively . Data are representative of at least three separate experiments ( A and B ) or are means ± SD for three separate experiments ( C ) . * * , P < 0 . 01 versus FBS - stimulated cells . JCB • Volume 214 • NumBer 4 • 2016 480 Furthermore , the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 suppressed the se - rum - induced production of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Fig . S3 A ) , lamellipo - dium formation , translocation of Myo1E to the cell periphery ( Fig . 5 A ) , and cell motility ( Fig . 4 C ) . In addition , exponen - tially growing MDA - MB - 231 cells exhibited lamellipodia at their periphery in which F - actin and Myo1E were colocalized , and PD184352 treatment of the cells induced a marked reduc - tion in the extent of lamellipodium formation and abolished the association of Myo1E with lamellipodial tips ( Fig . 5 A ) . Fi - nally , a low concentration of latrunculin A , which inhibits actin assembly through sequestration of monomeric actin , also sup - pressed translocation of Myo1E to the cell periphery in MKN1 cells ( Fig . 5 C ) , suggesting that serum - induced rearrangement of F - actin , rather than the production of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , is critical for localization of Myo1E to the plasma membrane . Subcellular fractionation confirmed that most Myo1E and almost all SH3P2 resided in the cytosolic fraction of resting MKN1 cells , that serum stimulation induced the translocation of a substantial proportion ( ∼ 10 % ) of Myo1E to the mem - brane fraction without affecting the cytosolic localization of SH3P2 , and that the serum - induced association of Myo1E with the membrane fraction was suppressed by PD184352 and by LY294002 ( Figs . 5 D and S3 B ) . These results suggested that after its dissociation from SH3P2 , Myo1E translocates from the cytosol to the tips of lamellipodia via binding to F - actin . Role of the TH2 domain in the localization of Myo1E to lamellipodial tips To examine how Myo1E interacts with the plasma mem - brane , we determined the localization of EGFP - tagged Myo1E and its deletion mutants in transfected MKN1 cells . Serum stimulation of the cells induced the formation of lamellipo - dia ( Fig . 5 A ) , to which wild - type Myo1E , Myo1E ( Δ SH3 ) , and Myo1E ( Δ TH2 - b2 / SH3 ) , but not Myo1E ( Δ TH2 / SH3 ) or Myo1E ( Δ TH1 / TH2 / SH3 ) , were found to be localized ( Fig . 6 A ) . Myo1E ( Δ TH2 - b2 / SH3 ) thus colocalized with F - actin at extended lamellipodial tips , whereas Myo1E ( Δ TH2 / SH3 ) did not ( Fig . 6 B ) . Although lamellipodia were less well defined in cells expressing a mutant of Myo1E lacking the motor head domain ( Myo1E ( Δ Motor ) ) than in those expressing the wild - type protein , localization of this mutant to the periph - ery of serum - stimulated cells was observed ( Fig . 6 A ) . Subcellular fractionation revealed that EGFP - tagged Myo1E and its deletion mutants as well as β - actin were detected in both cytosolic and membrane fractions of transfected MKN1 cells under exponentially growing conditions , although the pro - portion of each Myo1E protein in the membrane fraction varied ( Fig . 6 C ) . The proportion of Myo1E mutants lacking all or most of the TH2 domain ( Myo1E ( Δ TH2 / SH3 ) and Myo1E ( Δ TH1 / TH2 / SH3 ) ) in the membrane fraction was thus reduced compared with that for wild - type Myo1E or deletion mutants containing all or most of the TH2 domain ( Myo1E ( Δ SH3 ) , Myo1E ( Δ Mo - tor ) , Myo1E ( Δ TH2 - b1 / SH3 ) , and Myo1E ( Δ TH2 - b2 / SH3 ) ) . Figure 5 . Myo1E localizes to lamellipodial tips after dissociation from SH3P2 . ( A – C ) MKN1 cells deprived of serum for 12 h were incubated with or without 10 µM PD184352 ( PD18 ) , 10 µM LY294002 ( LY29 ) , or 50 nM latrunculin A ( Lat A ) for 30 min and then stimulated with 10 % FBS for 10 min . Exponentially growing MDA - MB - 231 cells were incubated with or without 10 µM PD184352 for 4 h . All cells were then fixed and stained with antibodies to Myo1E ( A and C , green ) or to SH3P2 ( B , green ) as well as with phalloidin ( A – C , magenta ) .

However , the C - terminal positively charged region of the TH2 domain , which mediates the interaction of Myo1E with SH3P2 ( Fig . 3 ) , does not appear to be required for the associa - tion of Myo1E with F - actin . SH3P2 suppresses the localization of Myo1E to lamellipodial tips We further examined the physiological relevance of the SH3P2 – Myo1E interaction . Forced expression of wild - type SH3P2 or SH3P2 ( S202A ) , but not that of an SH3P2 mutant lacking the Myo1E binding regions ( SH3P2 ( Δ PR / C ) ) , prevented the mem - brane association of Myo1E in MKN1 cells ( Fig . 7 A ) . Incuba - tion of a membrane fraction of MKN1 cells with recombinant Myo1E in vitro confirmed that the membrane association of Myo1E was suppressed by prior incubation with GST - SH3P2 in a concentration - dependent manner , but not by that with GST - SH3P2 ( Δ PR / C ) ( Fig . S4 ) . Forced expression of SH3P2 also suppressed the mem - brane association of Myo1E ( Δ SH3 ) , which interacts with SH3P2 , but not that of Myo1E ( Δ TH2 - b2 / SH3 ) , which does not interact with SH3P2 ( Fig . 7 B ) . RNAi - mediated depletion of SH3P2 increased the association of Myo1E with the mem - brane fraction even under resting conditions , and the extent of this association was not increased further by serum stimulation of the cells ( Fig . 7 C ) . Knockdown of SH3P2 with an siRNA targeting the 5 ′ - UTR sequence also increased the association of Myo1E with the membrane fraction , and this effect was Figure 6 .

Finally , whereas expression of SH3P2 ( S202A ) attenuated the serum - induced localization of Myo1E to lamellipodial tips , expression of SH3P2 ( Δ PR / C ) did not ( Fig . 7 E ) . Together , these results suggested that SH3P2 functions as a cytoplasmic anchor for Myo1E to suppress its localization to lamellipodial tips . Myo1E promotes active lamellipodium formation and thereby increases cell motility RNAi - mediated depletion of SH3P2 increased the motility of MKN1 cells as revealed by both wound - healing and transwell migration assays ( Fig . 8 A ) . In contrast , RNAi - mediated knock - down of Myo1E suppressed motility in MKN1 , MDA - MB - 231 , and HT - 1080 cells ( Fig . 8 B ) . Knockdown of Myo1E by itself with an siRNA targeting the ORF ( Fig . 8 C ) or the 5 ′ - UTR se - quence ( Fig . 8 D ) did not abolish the serum - induced formation of lamellipodia in MKN1 cells . However , lamellipodia formed under such conditions were poorly developed compared with those formed in cells transfected with a control siRNA . Im - portantly , forced expression of EGFP - Myo1E restored the formation of extended lamellipodia in cells depleted of endog - enous Myo1E with the siRNA targeting the 5 ′ - UTR sequence ( Fig . 8 D ) . Furthermore , rescue of Myo1E expression by infec - tion with a lentivirus encoding FLAG epitope – tagged Myo1E restored the motility of Myo1E - depleted MKN1 cells ( Fig . 8 E ) . Together , these results suggest that Myo1E is necessary for the formation of active lamellipodia required for cell motility . Discussion The molecular mechanisms underlying cell motility , especially with regard to the integration of signaling pathways and cyto - skeletal systems , remain poorly understood . Activation of both the PI3K and ERK pathways downstream of Ras is essential for the induction of cell motility . We recently identified SH3P2 as a negative regulator of cell motility whose function is inhib - ited by RSK - mediated phosphorylation ( Tanimura et al . , 2011 ) . We have now identified Myo1E as a binding partner of SH3P2 and uncovered the molecular mechanism by which SH3P2 inhibits cell motility . We first examined how SH3P2 interacts with Myo1E with the use of pull - down assays with GST - fused SH3P2 or Myo1E deletion mutants as baits as well as coimmunoprecipitation as - says with MKN1 cells expressing such deletion mutants tagged with EGFP . Our results suggest that SH3P2 interacts with Myo1E in the cytosol through two binding interfaces . The PR region of SH3P2 thus interacts with the SH3 domain of Myo1E , and the C - terminal acidic amino acid cluster of SH3P2 interacts with the positively charged region located at the C terminus of the TH2 domain of Myo1E ( Fig . 9 , 1a ) . We confirmed that the SH3 domain of Myo1E interacts directly with SH3P2 in a man - ner dependent on the PR region of SH3P2 . However , we failed to demonstrate direct interaction between the TH2 domain of Myo1E and SH3P2 or between the C - terminal acidic amino acid cluster of SH3P2 and Myo1E , possibly because such small domains of SH3P2 and Myo1E alone are not able to maintain their native conformations when expressed as EGFP - tagged or GST - fused constructs . Structural analysis of the SH3P2 – Myo1E complex will be required to provide a full understanding of the mode of interaction between these two proteins . Serum stimulation of cells induces activation of the ERK signaling pathway and the consequent phosphorylation of SH3P2 at Ser 202 by RSK , resulting in the dissociation of Myo1E from SH3P2 ( Fig . 9 , step 2 ) . Free Myo1E binds di - rectly to membranes via association of its TH1 domain with anionic phospholipids such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , with such interactions being relatively nonspecific and electrostatic in nature rather than stereospecific ( Feeser et al . , 2010 ) . We have now shown that the TH2 domain is required for the pref - erential localization of Myo1E to lamellipodial tips via binding to F - actin . This domain was previously shown to be required for the localization of Myo1E to invadosomes ( Ouderkirk and Krendel , 2014 ) . Long - tailed class 1 myosins bind to F - actin via the TH2 domain as well as the motor domain ( Doberstein and Pollard , 1992 ; Jung and Hammer , 1994 ; Rosenfeld and Rener , 1994 ) . Furthermore , the TH2 domain was shown to mediate the targeting of Xenopus laevis Myo1E to newly assembled actin in vivo ( Yu and Bement , 2007 ) and to be required for the targeting of Myo1B to dynamic actin waves in Dictyostelium discoideum ( Brzeska et al . , 2014 ) . The binding of the TH2 domain to F - actin thus provides a mechanism by which this class of myosin can be targeted specifically to sites of active actin assembly . To - gether , these previous and our present observations suggest that the TH2 domain plays a key role in the localization of Myo1E to lamellipodial tips through its binding to F - actin , whereas the TH1 domain may facilitate the association of Myo1E with the plasma membrane by binding to anionic phospholipids . Myo1E localized at the plasma membrane interacts with F - actin to generate mechanical force and thereby regulates plasma membrane tension ( McConnell and Tyska , 2010 ) . Myo1E has also been shown to transport or recruit several effector molecules such as dynamin , synaptojanin - 1 , and the N - WASP – WIP complex to the membrane – cytoskeleton inter - face in a process dependent on the binding of the PR region of the respective cargo to the SH3 domain of Myo1E ( Kren - del et al . , 2007 ; Cheng et al . , 2012 ; Gupta et al . , 2013 ) . The TH2 domain of Myo1E also contains three conserved PR re - gions ( Fig . S1 B ) , through which Myo1E might bind to SH3 domain – containing proteins and transport or recruit them to the plasma membrane . These observations suggest that the me - chanical force generated by Myo1E – F - actin interaction at the plasma membrane together with the functions of effector mole - cules transported or recruited by Myo1E through binding to its SH3 domain and possibly to its TH2 domain coordinately in - duce active lamellipodium formation and thereby promote cell migration ( Fig . 9 , step 3 ) . Given that SH3P2 also binds to the SH3 domain of Myo1E via its PR region , SH3P2 may regulate the interaction of PR region – containing effector molecules with Myo1E in a compet - itive manner . In this regard , deletion of its SH3 domain did not affect the binding of Myo1E to SH3P2 in MKN1 cells . The SH3 domain of most Myo1E molecules in these cells may be occu - pied by effector proteins rather than by SH3P2 . Thus , although SH3P2 is able to bind to Myo1E through the two binding in - terfaces identified in the present study , the interaction between the C - terminal acidic amino acid cluster of SH3P2 and the pos - itively charged region at the C terminus of the TH2 domain of Myo1E may be responsible for the association of the two pro - teins in most SH3P2 – Myo1E complexes in cells ( Fig . 9 , 1b ) . The major finding of the present study is that SH3P2 regulates the intracellular localization of Myo1E in an ERK pathway – dependent manner .

Data erK signaling regulates localization of myo1e • Tanimura et al . 485 forms a complex with most Myo1E to prevent its localization to the plasma membrane in cells in which basal ERK activity is limited . On cell stimulation , however , activated RSK1 phos - phorylates SH3P2 at Ser 202 and thereby induces the dissocia - tion of Myo1E from SH3P2 and the subsequent translocation of Myo1E to the tips of lamellipodia , a process that is essential for the induction of cell motility . Binding of SH3P2 likely renders Myo1E inaccessible to F - actin and possibly to effector mole - cules , thereby preventing Myo1E localization to lamellipodial tips . SH3P2 therefore functions as a cytoplasmic anchor for Myo1E and thereby negatively regulates cell motility . Activation of the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways by serum stimulation results in the production of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and consequent F - actin rearrangement at the leading edge of the cell as well as in phosphorylation of SH3P2 and consequent dissociation of Myo1E , respectively . The ERK pathway also contributes to the rearrangement of F - actin via ERK - medi - ated phosphorylation of WAVE2 and Abi1 , components of the WAVE2 regulatory complex ( Mendoza et al . , 2011 ) . Myo1E thus appears to be positioned at an integration point for the ERK and PI3K pathways in the coordinated regulation of cell motil - ity , with Myo1E released from its cytoplasmic anchor SH3P2 moving along the rearranged actin filaments toward the leading edge of the cell . Myo1E thereby localized at lamellipodial tips , and the effector molecules recruited by binding to its SH3 do - main then cooperatively promote lamellipodium extension and consequent cell migration . Further studies are required to de - termine the precise molecular mechanisms by which the down - stream targets of Myo1E facilitate cell motility .

For recombinant SH3P2 or SH3P2 ( Δ PR ) , the GST tag was cleaved with PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare ) . Transfection of tumor cells with pEGFP - C1 – based plasmids was performed with the use of Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . Production of and infection with recombinant lentiviruses An human immunodeficiency virus – 1 – based lentiviral vector system was obtained from D . Trono ( École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lau - sanne , Switzerland ; Zufferey et al . , 1997 ) . A cDNA for FLAG - tagged human Myo1E ( Myo1E - FLAG ) was introduced into pRRL . Recombi - nant lentiviruses were produced by transfection of HEK293T cells in a 10 - cm dish for 72 h with 1 . 5 µg pMD2 . G , 3 . 0 µg pMDLg / pRRE , 1 . 5 µg pRSV - Rev , and 6 . 0 µg pRRL - CMV - GFP - Sin - 18 or pRRL - CMV - Myo1E - FLAG . Culture supernatants containing lentiviruses were cen - trifuged at 1 , 200 g for 10 min , and the resulting soluble fraction was passed through a 0 . 45 - µm filter ( EMD Millipore ) . Lentiviruses in the filtrate were then collected by precipitation with polyethylene glycol and suspended in 500 µl Opti - MEM ( Gibco ) . MKN1 cells that had been transfected with Myo1E siRNA for 24 h in a 24 - well plate were in - fected with recombinant lentiviruses encoding GFP or Myo1E - FLAG ( 10 µl of the respective virus suspension ) for 24 h and then incubated in fresh culture medium for 24 h . RNAi siRNAs for human Myo1E ( # 1 , Stealth select RNAi MYO1E - HSS106891 ; # 2 , Stealth select RNAi MYO1EHSS106893 ) and for human SH3P2 ( # 449 and # 500 ; Tanimura et al . , 2011 ) were obtained from Invitrogen . The sequences 5 ′ - GAG TAC GGA TTA AGC GGC CGA AGAA - 3 ′ ( Myo1E # 3 ) and 5 ′ - GAG GCG ACG GTT GTA AGC CAG JCB • Volume 214 • NumBer 4 • 2016 488 ACAA - 3 ′ ( SH3P2 # 36 ) were designed to generate siRNA duplexes specific for the 5 ′ - UTR sequence of human Myo1E or SH3P2 mRNAs ( Invitrogen ) . Stealth RNAi Negative Control Medium GC Duplex was used as a control ( Invitrogen ) . Subconfluent cultures of cells were transfected with siRNAs ( 20 nM ) for 48 or 72 h with the use of Lipo - fectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) . In - gel digestion and protein identification Bands of interest were excised from Coomassie brilliant blue – stained gels , cut into 1 - mm pieces , dehydrated with 50 % acetonitrile containing 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , and dried with the use of a vacuum centrifuge . The gel pieces were rehydrated with digestion solution ( 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 con - taining sequencing - grade modified trypsin [ Promega ] at 10 µg / ml ) and incubated overnight at 37°C , and the resulting peptides were extracted with 5 % trifluoroacetic acid in 50 % acetonitrile . The peptide mixture was subjected to liquid chromatography , electrospray ionization , and tandem MS analysis ( LTQ - XL ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . MS / MS data were extracted with Proteome Discoverer v . 3 . 3 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and spectra were searched against a human subdatabase obtained from the public nonredundant protein database ( International Protein Index version 3 . 84 presented by The European Bioinformatics Institute ) . Each protein was identified on the basis of more than two unique peptides . Immunofluorescence microscopy Cells grown on glass coverslips and exposed to various agents were fixed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 . After blocking of nonspecific sites with 2 . 5 % BSA in PBS , the cells were immunostained with antibodies to Myo1E ( 1 / 200 dilution ) or to SH3P2 ( 1 / 200 ) , and immune complexes were detected with Alexa Fluor 488 – or 546 – conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit IgG ( 1 / 200 dilution ; Molecular Probes ) . F - actin was visualized with the use of Alexa Fluor 350 – labeled phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . Images were acquired with an Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a FluoArc mercury lamp , a Plan - NEO FLU AR 40× / 0 . 75 objec - tive lens , and an AxioCam MRm camera ( ZEI SS ) . For comparison of the localization of Myo1E or of EGFP - Myo1E and its mutants , images were acquired with the same exposure time in respective experiments ( typically 2 s for Myo1E and 5 s for EGFP ) . Images were analyzed with AxioVision software version 4 . 8 . 2 ( ZEI SS ) . Statistical analysis Data are presented as means ± SD and were analyzed with the two - tailed Student’s t test . A p - value of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Online supplemental material Fig .
