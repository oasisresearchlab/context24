Key words : dynamin , amphiphysin , phagocytosis , testis he family of dynamin GTPase is composed of 3 isoforms , dynamin 1 ﾝ 3 [ 1 , 2 ] . All dynamins contain 4 functional domains , the N - terminal GTPase domain , the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , the GTPase eﬀector domain , and the C - terminal proline / arginine - rich domain ( PRD ) . While the PH domain serves as binding motif for phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , PRD mediates interaction with various SH3 domain - containing proteins such as amphiphysin 1 . In neurons , dynamin 1 and amphiphy - sin 1 cooperatively function in the ﬁssion process of clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 3 ] . Recent studies indicate that dynamins are impli - cated in the formation of a wide variety of actin - based cellular events , including the formation of growth cones [ 4 ] , podosomes [ 5 ] , invadopodia [ 6 ] , lamelli - podia and dorsal membrane ruﬄes [ 7 , 8 ] , and phago - cytosis [ 9 ] . Ubiquitously expressed dynamin 2 directly interacts with cortactin , a F - actin binding protein , which in turn modulates cell shape and clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 8 , 10 ] . In testis , Sertoli cells participate in the maturation of germ cells and the release of sperm [ 11 ] . Sertoli cells have high phagocytic activity , by which the cells eliminate residual cytoplasm of spermatids [ 12 , 13 ] or apoptotic germ cells [ 14 ] . Phagocytosis in Sertoli cells is initiated by the recognition of phosphatidyl - serine ( PS ) exposed at the germ cell surface by PS receptors [ 14 , 15 ] . Sertoli cells express high levels of dynamin 2 , dynamin 3 , and amphiphysin 1 [ 16 , 17 ] . Expression of amphiphysin 1 and dynamin 2 in testis coinciden - tally increase with the onset of spermatogenesis [ 16 ] . In addition , both proteins accumulate at tubulobulbar complexes , transiently formed structures in Sertoli cells prior to sperm release [ 18 ] . We have recently reported that amphiphysin 1 participates in actin polymerization during phagocytosis in Sertoli cells T Acta Med .

Yamada ) 1 Nakanishi et al . : Dynamin 2 Cooperates with Amphiphysin 1 in Phagocytosis in Sertol Produced by The Berkeley Electronic Press , 2008 [ 19 ] . In response to stimulation with PS liposomes , Sertoli cells form membrane ruﬄes , where amphiphy - sin 1 is concentrated . The ruﬄe formation and phago - cytosis , but not clathrin - mediated endocytosis , were found to be abolished in an amphiphysin 1 siRNA - treated Sertoli cell line , or Sertoli cells from amphi - physin 1 ( ﾝ / ﾝ ) mice . Interestingly , the expression of dynamin 2 was decreased by approximately 30 ｵ in amphiphysin 1 siRNA - treated cells . These results implied that dynamin 2 cooperates with amphiphysin 1 in Sertoli cells . In the present study , we explored the possibility that dynamins function in Sertoli cell function . Here we demonstrate that dynamin 2 is implicated , at least in part , in PS - dependent phagocytosis with amphiphy - sin 1 .

Dynamin 2 , dynamin 3 , and amphiphysin 1 are highly expressed in Ser - W3 cells , a rat Sertoli cell line . We have previously demon - strated that amphiphysin 1 is implicated in ruﬄe for - mation in PS - dependent phagocytosis by Sertoli cells [ 19 ] . As it was anticipated that dynamin 2 interacts with of amphiphysin 1 in the cells [ 9 ] , we ﬁrst deter - mined localization of dynamin 2 in the PS - stimulated Sertoli cells . Cells with peripheral ruﬄes were char - acterized by the presence of thick peripheral actin ﬁlament accumulation [ 19 ] . Dynamin 2 accumulated at ruﬄes , which were actin ﬁlament - rich structures ( Fig . 1A , arrowheads ) . Double immunoﬂuorescence demonstrated that dynamin 2 partially colocalized with amphiphysin 1 at bright puncta throughout the cyto - plasm . Notably , both proteins were highly enriched at ruﬄes ( Fig . 1B , arrowheads ; ref . [ 19 ] ) . In con - trast , dynamin 3 did not co - localize with amphiphysin 1 at either ruﬄes in PS - stimulated Sertoli cells ( data 387 Role of dynamin 2 and amphiphysin 1 in testis December 2008 Resting Dyn 2 F - Actin ＋PS - lipo . ＋PS - lipo . ＋PC - lipo .

We next determined the interactions between We next determined the interactions between dynamins and amphiphysin 1 by GST pull - down assay . Consistent with the co - localization of dynamin 2 with amphiphysin 1 ( Fig . 1 ) , dynamin 2 speciﬁcally bound to both full - length and the SH3 domain of amphiphy - sin 1 ( Fig . 2A , right 2 lanes ) . The association of endogenous amphiphysin 1 and dynamin 2 in Sertoli cells was conﬁrmed by cross - linking with DSP ( Fig . 2B , right lane ) . It was therefore suggested that dynamin 2 might also function with amphiphysin 1 in the formation of ruﬄes .

We next examined the dynamics of dynamin 2 during PS - dependent phagocytosis . For this purpose , Ser - W3 cells expressing dynamin 2 - GFP were stimu - lated with rhodamine - labeled PS - liposomes and observed by time - lapse . Dynamin 2 - GFP began to accumulate at the phagocytic sites soon after the PS stimulation , and then soon later the accumulation disappeared ( Fig . 3A , arrowhead ) . A similar tran - sient accumulation of dynamin at ruﬄes was observed , as revealed by dual - live imaging of dynamin 2 - mCherry and GFP - amphiphysin 1 . Importantly , amphiphysin 1 acted synchronously with dynamin 2 during ruﬄe formation ( Fig . 3B ) . It has been reported that expression of the dyna - min 2 dominant negative mutant ( K44A ) results in a decrease in phagocytosis by inhibiting extension of the plasma membrane [ 9 ] , and contraction of the cells [ 22 ] . We conﬁrmed in Sertoli cells that liposome uptake is inhibited by expression of dynamin K44A mutant , and the expression - induced contraction of cell shape ( Fig . 4 ) . Under these conditions , the dynamin 2 K44A mutant led to mis - localization of amphiphysin 1 , which appeared as large dots , and inhibited forma - tion of ruﬄes in PS - stimulated rat cultured Sertoli cells ( Fig . 3C upper right ) . These results suggest cooperative functions of dynamin 2 with amphiphysin 1 in PS - dependent phagocytosis . Discussion We have demonstrated in the present study that dynamin 2 but not dynamin 3 associates with amphi - physin 1 , and that dynamin 2 may be implicated in PS - dependent phagocytosis in Sertoli cells . Sertoli cells highly express dynamin 2 , dynamin 3 , and amphiphysin 1 [ 16 ﾝ 19 ] . However , the physiolog - ical function of these proteins in the cell remains to be elucidated . We have recently reported that amphiphy - sin 1 stimulates actin assembly and participates in both ruﬄe formation and phagocytosis in Sertoli cells . Interestingly , RNAi for amphiphysin 1 in cells decreases expression of dynamin 2 to up to 30 ｵ of control [ 19 ] . These observations strongly suggest that dynamin 2 functions in phagocytosis together with 388 Acta Med . Okayama Vol . 62 , No . 6 Vol . 62 , No . 6 Vol . 62 , No . 6 Nakanishi et al .

Wild - type or mutant dynamin were co - transfected with EGFP ( dynamin : EGFP ＝ 10 : 1 in cDNA ratio ) in primary cultured rat Sertoli cells . The cells were stimulated with PS - liposomes , as described in Fig . 1 A , and stained for amphiphysin 1 . Note that immuno - reactivity for amphiphysin 1 is represented as large dots in dynamin K 44 A expressing cells ( upper right ) , which can be identiﬁed by GFP expression ( lower right ) .

Dynamin 2 in the present study accumulated at ruﬄes together with amphiphysin 1 , as revealed by double immunoﬂuorescence and live - imaging ( Figs . 1 and 3 ) . The association between dynamin 2 and amphiphysin 1 was mediated via the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 , as shown by pull - down and cross - link - ing experiments . The interaction between dynamin 2 and amphiphysin 1 might be rather weak and / or tenta - tive in Sertoli cells , because the association could not be detected without a cross - linker ( data not shown ) . This result is consistent with transient accumulation of these proteins at ruﬄes ( Fig . 3B ) . Over - expression of dynamin 2 K44A in Sertoli cells resulted in not only the inhibition of PS - dependent liposome uptake ( Fig . 4 ) , but also mis - localization of amphiphysin 1 ( Fig . 3C ) . The immunoreactivity of amphiphysin 1 in dynamin 2 K44A - expressed cells appeared as distinct puncta compared to that in dyna - min 2 WT - expressed cells ( Fig . 3C ) . These results suggest that dynamin 2 may participate in PS - dependent phagocytosis together with amphiphysin 1 . Dynamin 3 is unlikely to be involved in Sertoli cell phagocytosis because dynamin 3 neither binds to amphiphysin 1 ( Fig . 2A ) nor localizes at ruﬄes ( data not shown ) . In addition , dynamin 3 does not co - local - ize with amphiphysin 1 in seminiferous tubules [ 18 ] . The proline arginine - rich domain ( PRD ) of dynamin 3 has ＜ 60 ｵ of identity with that of dynamin 2 . Thus , it may be possible that dynamin 3 PRD has diﬀerent characteristics , and therefore it is possible that the functions of dynamin 3 are diﬀerent than those of dynamin 2 . Dynamin 2 is involved in actin dynamics during ruﬄe formation in ﬁbroblasts [ 10 , 23 , 24 ] and in phagocytosis in macrophages [ 9 ] . Dynamin 2 at the plasma membrane associates with cortactin , which speciﬁcally binds to F - actin [ 10 , 29 ] . Furthermore , dynamin 2 interacts with Rac1 and regulates the localization with Rac1 , and both proteins are impli - cated in the formation of ruﬄes [ 25 ] . Thus , dynamin 2 as well as amphiphysin 1 may cooperate with these molecules that regulate actin dynamics . In conclusion , we have demonstrated that dynamin 390 Acta Med .
