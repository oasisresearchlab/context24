The for - mation of coﬁlin rods ( containing 1 : 1 coﬁlin : actin ) has been studied in cultured mammalian neurons under con - ditions of excessive glutamate , ATP depletion ( ATP - D ) or oxidative stress . These conditions simulate the pathologies occurring during ischemic stroke . In this study , we investigated the potential involvement of coﬁlin during ischemic - stroke induced apoptosis . Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion ( tMCAO ) was performed to establish an experimental model of ischemic stroke . We used 2 , 3 , 5 - Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride ( TTC ) and immunostaining of the neuronal marker neuronal nuclei ( NeuN ) to evaluate the evolving phases of infarction in rats subjected tMCAO . Immunostaining and TdT - mediated dUTP Nick - End Labeling ( TUNEL ) apoptosis staining were collaboratively used to examine coﬁlin rod formation and cell apoptosis in response to ischemia at diﬀerent time points ( 2 h , 8 h , 24 h and 7 d ) . Our results showed that infarct volume increased initially , between the ﬁrst 2 h to 24 h and became stabilized 24 h to 7 d after tMCAO . The formation of coﬁlin rods signiﬁcantly increased in the cortical core ( from 2 h ) and penumbra ( from 8 h ) , peaking at 24 h and gradually diminishing 7 d after tMCAO . Pro - gressive accumulation of coﬁlin rods subsequently induced microtubule - associated protein - 2 ( MAP2 ) degrada - tion and ischemic cell apoptosis in the infarct cortex after stroke . To further corroborate the role of activated coﬁlin in ischemic stroke , inhibition of coﬁlin by LIM kinase ( Limk1 ) over - expression was performed . Lmik1 reduced coﬁlin rod formation and MAP2 degradation , and consequently , attenuated coﬁlin mediated - apoptosis 24 h after tMCAO . From this evidence we conclude that coﬁlin plays a role in the onset of ischemic - induced apop - tosis and may be eﬃcacious in future studies as a drug target for ischemic stroke .

INTRODUCTION Ischemic stroke has become a major source of long - term neurological disability and death around the world , accounting for 80 – 87 % of all stroke incidences ( Zerna et al . , 2018 ; Benjamin et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , the current health care burden of stroke victims in China is severe , with an estimated 2 . 5 million people suﬀering from stroke annually and 1 million experiencing death from a stroke - related disability ( Liu et al . , 2011 ; Feigin et al . , 2014 ; Zhou et al . , 2019 ) . Currently , thrombolytic therapy is the only FDA - approved treatment for ischemic stroke in cur - rent clinical practice ( Catanese et al . , 2017 ) . The major pathogenic mechanisms of the ischemic cascade include glutamate - mediated excitotoxicity , calcium overload , inﬂammation , oxidative stress and apoptosis ( Macrae , 2011 ) . Interestingly , it is widely accepted that apoptosis in the penumbra is a reversible process ( Liu et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , understanding the molecular mecha - nisms governing neuronal apoptosis may indicate more appropriate molecular targets for the development of eﬀective therapies to reduce neuronal loss and brain damage during stroke . Coﬁlin , a cytoskeletal actin severing protein , is inactivated by LIM kinase ( LIMK ) - mediated phosphorylation , and reactivated by Slingshot ( SSH ) and chronophin - mediated dephosphorylation at its serine - 3 ( Ser3 ) residue ( Mizuno , 2013 ) . A high coﬁlin / F - actin ratio , coﬁlin dephosphorylation and / or coﬁlin oxida - tion are three major mechanisms of coﬁlin rod formation . The formation of coﬁlin rods ( containing 1 : 1 coﬁlin : actin ) has been studied in cultured mammalian neurons treated https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . neuroscience . 2020 . 07 . 019 0306 - 4522 / (cid:1) 2020 The Author ( s ) .

N EUROSCIENCE RESEARCH ARTICLE B . Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 64 with excitotoxic levels of glutamate , ATP depletion ( ATP - D ) or oxidation of A b ( Minamide et al . , 2000 ; Whiteman et al . , 2009 ; Cichon et al . , 2012 ; Bamburg and Bernstein , 2016 ) . These pathological stimulations increase activated coﬁlin through dephosphorylation , enhanced ADP - actin , and generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) which contribute to coﬁlin oxidation and rod formation . Eventually , high production of ROS leads to the targeting of mitochondria and induction of the release of cytochrome c , initiating apoptosis ( Chua et al . , 2003 ; Klamt et al . , 2009 ; Posadas et al . , 2012 ; Alhadidi et al . , 2016 ; Madineni et al . , 2016 ) . The coﬁlin rod inducers mentioned above are similar to the pathologies exhibited during ischemic stroke . As such , we proposed that ischemic stroke would induce coﬁlin rods and apoptosis in the infarct area through the imbalanced activity among actin - regulatory proteins such as LIMK . In support of this notion , a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model was established to examine coﬁlin rod formation in response to ischemic stroke . To further probe the eﬀect of coﬁlin on stroke - induced neuronal apoptosis , we inhibited coﬁlin activity by via lentiviral Limk1 overexpression . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Animals Adult male Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rats ( weighing 280 – 300 g ) were supplied by Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co . , Ltd . ( Shanghai , China ) . They were individually housed in plastic cages under a 12 : 12 light / dark cycle with free access to tap water and a standard diet prior to the test . All experiments were performed strictly in accordance with the International Ethical Guidelines and the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . Primary neuronal culture Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared and cultured similarly to our previous reports ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) . Brieﬂy , hippocampi were dissected from embry - onic day 18 rats and digested with 0 . 05 % trypsin – EDTA for 20 min at 37 (cid:3) C . Then , dissociated cells were counted and plated onto poly - D - lysine - coated glass coverslips kept at 37 (cid:3) C and in 5 % CO 2 . After culturing for 1 d , half of the media were changed into neurobasal medium supple - mented with 2 mM GlutaMAX TM - I Supplement , 2 % B27 and 25 l / ml penicillin / streptomycin . Two m M Ara - C ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was added 6 – 8 d after plat - ing during the culture medium change , and cells were fed twice weekly thereafter . Unless stated otherwise , all tis - sue culture reagents were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ( Waltham , MA , USA ) . ATP - D and assessment of neuronal apoptosis Primary cultured neurons ( 11 – 12 DIV ) were washed twice with PBS and were incubated at 37 (cid:3) C for 20 min in either normal growth medium ( control cells ) or glucose - free DMEM containing 3 mM 2 - deoxyglucose and 5 mM NaN 3 to yield ATP - depleted cells . Twenty - four hours after ATP - D , neuronal apoptosis was assessed in situ by the TdT - mediated dUTP Nick - End Labeling ( TUNEL ) assay ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Stereotaxic viral injection RFP - LIMK and RFP - Ctrl lentivirus were synthesized and sequenced at GeneChem China ( Shanghai , China ) . Surgeries were performed on 8 week old SD rats ( about 200 g ) for virus injection , 7 d before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion ( tMCAO ) . The rats were anesthetized by isoﬂurane ( 3 % initial , 2 % maintenance ) in oxygen with spontaneous respiration via mask , then were placed in a stereotaxic frame . The animals underwent a midline scalp incision and hole was drilled on the skulls above the somatosensory cortex . A 3 l l volume of the lentivirus was stereotaxically delivered into the ipsilateral cortex ( position : AP 0 . 7 mm , ML 3 . 25 mm , DV – 2 . 4 mm ) with a 5 l l syringe and a 34 gage needle . The injection rate was controlled at 0 . 2 l l / min , and the needle was moved up during the injection at speed of 0 . 1 mm / min . After injection , the needle was kept for at least 10 additional minutes before being withdrawn at a rate of 1 mm / min . Induction of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion The rat model of MCAO was induced as described previously ( Longa et al . , 1989 ) . Brieﬂy , under the operat - ing microscope , a silicon - coated nylon suture ( 4 - 0 ) was introduced into the middle cerebral artery to decrease regional cerebral blood ﬂow , which was measured through a Laser Doppler Flowmetry device ( LDF100C , Biopac Systems , Goleta , CA , USA ) . Ischemic rats that showed a sharp decrease to a ﬂow rate 20 % of baseline ( before ischemia ) were used for further experimentation . 2 , 3 , 5 - Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride ( TTC ) staining For TTC staining , all rats were euthanized with 5 % isoﬂurane followed by cold saline perfusion . The rats’ brains were coronally sliced into 2 - mm - thick sections and stained with 2 . 5 % TTC ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) ( w / v ) at 37 (cid:3) C for 20 min . The infarct volume was determined by Image J software ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) and expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere , as described previously ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) . Immunostaining Cultured cells were rinsed with PBS twice and ﬁxed for 45 min in a solution of 4 % paraformaldehyde containing 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde . Coverslips were then rinsed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 100 % methanol at (cid:2) 20 (cid:3) C for 2 min . After blocking with 10 % donkey serum , coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C with the following primary antibodies : mouse anti - microtubule - associated protein - 2 ( MAP2 ) ( 1 : 300 ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , Guinea Pig anti - neuronal nuclei ( NeuN ) ( 1 : 500 ; Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) or rabbit B . Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 65 anti - coﬁlin ( 1 : 1000 ; cytoskeleton , Denver , CO , USA ) . The following day , samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with corresponding secondary antibodies : anti - mouse Alexa 594 - conjugated , anti - Guinea Pig Alexa 647 - conjugated or anti - rabbit Alexa 488 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 300 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Deeply anesthetized animals were transcardially perfused with saline , followed by 4 % PFA in 0 . 1 M phosphate buﬀer ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The rats’ brains were post - ﬁxed overnight at 4 (cid:3) C and cryoprotected with successive 15 % and 30 % sucrose sunk in PBS at 4 (cid:3) C for 3 d . Coronal cryostat sections ( 15 - l m thick ) were made on a Leica CM1950 cryostat ( Leica Biosystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Coronal sections were dried at room temperature for at least 30 min , washed in PBS ( 10 min ) , and permeabilized with 100 % methanol at (cid:2) 20 (cid:3) C for 2 min . After blocking with 10 % donkey serum , primary antibodies were added together with a donkey serum blocking solution in PBS and set to incubate overnight at 4 (cid:3) C . Sections were washed three times in PBS for 15 min and incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h . Sections were again washed three times in PBS and then mounted onto glass slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Molecular Probe , Eugene , OR , USA ) . Images were visualized using an Olympus BX51 microscope with DP controller 3 . 2 software ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) or Nikon A1R - A1 Confocal System under (cid:3) 10 / 0 . 45 or (cid:3) 20 / 0 . 75 objective with NIS Elements 4 . 2 Software ( Nikon Instruments , Tokyo , Japan ) . TUNEL staining TUNEL staining ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) was used to analyze neuronal apoptosis according to the manufacturer’s instructions as previously described ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) . Statistical analysis All data were expressed as mean ± standard error mean ( SEM ) , and analyzed using the SPSS package for Windows ( Version 18 . 0 ) . The number of samples varied from 4 to 6 , and diﬀerences with p < 0 . 05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant . Statistical analysis of the data was performed with Student’s t test or a one - way ANOVA followed by the LSD post hoc test . RESULTS ATP - D induced coﬁlin rod formation and neuronal apoptosis Previous studies have identiﬁed that coﬁlin has a high aﬃnity for actin and rarely forms aggregation in neuronal cells under normal physiological conditions . However , under neuropathological conditions ( such as excessive glutamate or oxidative stress ) coﬁlin rod formation has been reported ( Minamide et al . , 2000 ; Whiteman et al . , 2009 ; Cichon et al . , 2012 ; Bamburg and Bernstein , 2016 ) . Here , we performed immunostain - ing with antibodies speciﬁc for endogenous coﬁlin and two neuronal markers ( MAP2 and NeuN ) in cultured hip - pocampal neurons after ATP - D . The formation of coﬁlin rods was found to be signiﬁcantly increased by exposure to ATP - D treatment for 20 min compared with control medium ( Ctrl : 5 ± 0 . 8 / mm 2 , n = 6 ; ATP - D : 122 . 8 ± 16 / mm 2 , n = 6 ; p < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 1A , B ) , these results were consistent with previous results ( Minamide et al . , 2000 ; Whiteman et al . , 2009 ; Cichon et al . , 2012 ; Bamburg and Bernstein , 2016 ) . ATP - D stimulation also resulted in the decreased density of neuron ( MAP2 + / NeuN + ) from 38 . 1 ± 2 . 4 / mm 2 ( n = 6 ) to 24 . 6 ± 1 . 3 / mm 2 ( n = 6 ; p < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . During oxidative stress in the form of excitotoxicity , coﬁlin has been observed to translocate to the mitochondria where it induces the release of cytochrome C , initiating apoptotic cell death ( Chua et al . , 2003 ; Klamt et al . , 2009 ; Posadas et al . , 2012 ; Alhadidi et al . , 2016 ; Madineni et al . , 2016 ) . To investigate the functional consequences of coﬁlin rod formation on neuronal apoptosis , we performed TUNEL staining . Quantitatively , the average density of apoptotic neurons ( TUNEL + ) in the Ctrl group was 2 . 3 ± 0 . 3 / mm 2 ( n = 6 ) , signiﬁcantly lower than the 17 . 3 ± 1 . 1 / mm 2 ( n = 6 ) observed in the ATP - D group ( Fig . 1D ) . Together , these results indicate that ATP - D for 20 min was suﬃcient to induce coﬁlin rod formation and a signiﬁcant increase in neuronal apoptosis . Temporal progression of cerebral infarct volume after tMCAO In vivo modeling of ischemic stroke ( Fig . 2A ) was performed via subjection to tMCAO ( n = 6 ) and sacriﬁce at diﬀerent end points ( 2 h , 8 h , 24 h and 7 d ) . The brain slices of these rats were stained with TTC and infarct volumes on the ipsilateral region were measured . At earlier time points ( 2 and 8 h ) after tMCAO , the infarct core was limited to the striatum , with the penumbra beginning to exhibit a pink staining around this central infarct core ( Fig . 2B ) . The total infarct volumes peaked at 24 h with no further infarction growth observed by 7 d post - occlusion . There was signiﬁcant diﬀerence between infarction volumes at 2 h , 8 h and 24 h , while no marked diﬀerence was detectable at 24 h and 7 d after tMCAO ( Fig . 2C , D ) . Neuron loss in the cortical core and penumbra was time - dependent after tMCAO The neuronal nuclei marker NeuN is an indicator of mature neurons throughout the central nervous system , including the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , thalamus , cerebellum and spinal cord . Herein , we found that there was a time - dependent reduction in NeuN staining in the ischemic cortex after stroke , achieving minimal levels at 7 d of tMCAO . Similar to what was observed with TTC staining , Fig . 3A – C showed that no infarct was visible in the cortex at the earliest time point ( 2 h of tMCAO ) though a small area of neuronal loss was seen in the cortical core after 8 h of tMCAO . Subsequently , there was a signiﬁcant decrease in neuron number at both the cortical penumbra and core areas 24 h and 7 d after 66 B . Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 Fig . 1 .

Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 67 tMCAO , compared with an earlier time point ( 8 h ) ( Fig . 3A – D ) . The evidence strongly suggested that signiﬁcant neuronal loss occurs after stroke , a loss which is associated with an increase of infarct volume after tMCAO . Coﬁlin rod formation and MAP2 degradation was gradually induced in the cortical penumbra and core areas of tMCAO rats Numerous studies over the years have demonstrated the formation of coﬁlin rods in the hippocampus and cortex of AD patients and various mouse models ( Minamide et al . , 2000 ; Whiteman et al . , 2009 ; Cichon et al . , 2012 ; Bamburg and Bernstein , 2016 ) . Moreover , the formation of coﬁlin rods has been studied in cultured mammalian neurons treated with excitotoxic levels of glutamate , ATP - D or oxidative stress ( Minamide et al . , 2000 ; Whiteman et al . , 2009 ; Cichon et al . , 2012 ; Bamburg and Bernstein , 2016 ) . We therefore analyzed the occurrence of coﬁlin rod formation in rats subjected tMCAO injury . The extent of neuronal injury during stroke could be identiﬁed by the attenuation of MAP2 proteins , mainly expressed in the dendrites and in the neuronal cell body ( Mohan and John , 2015 ) . It has been reported that dendritic micro - tubule integrity is impaired by coﬁlin rods ( Cichon et al . , 2012 ) , which subsequently facilitates cell death ( Madineni et al . , 2016 ) . Here , coﬁilin and MAP2 double - labeling was performed on the coronal brain sections in sham - operated and tMCAO rats and evaluated at diﬀer - ent time points ( 2 h , 8 h , 24 h and 7 d ) . As shown in Fig . 4A , E , coﬁlin rods were present both in the cortical core and penumbra area . Quantiﬁcation of the results ( Fig . 4B , F ) showed that the density of coﬁlin rods was signiﬁcantly increased from 2 h in the cortical Fig . 2 .

Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 core and 8 h in the penumbra , peaking at 24 h and diminished 7 d after tMCAO . Conversely , MAP2 was notably decreased in aﬀected brain areas , reaching minimal expression at 7 d ( Fig . 4C , G ) , which is agreement with observations in previous studies ( Popp et al . , 2009 ; Hartig et al . , 2016 ) . Probing further , there was a signiﬁcant positive linear relationship between MAP2 intensity and NeuN density ( Fig . 4D , core : r 2 = 0 . 75 , F = 66 . 28 , p < 0 . 001 ; penumbra : r 2 = 0 . 82 , F = 102 . 9 , p < 0 . 001 ) following tMCAO . Interestingly , the changes in coﬁlin rod formation were inversely corre - lated with MAP2 intensity ( Fig . 4H , core : r 2 = 0 . 44 , F = 17 . 58 , p < 0 . 001 ; penumbra : r 2 = 0 . 18 , F = 4 . 87 , p < 0 . 05 ) . Together , these results suggested that a pro - gressive accumulation of coﬁlin rods may induce MAP2 degradation in the infarct cortex after ischemic stroke . Time course quantiﬁcation of TUNEL - positive cells in infarct area of tMCAO rats It has been shown that coﬁlin plays an important role in the initiation of mitochondrial - dependent apoptosis ( Chua et al . , 2003 ; Posadas et al . , 2012 ) . We next employed TUNEL staining to examine changes in cellular apoptosis in the lesioned cortex after ischemic stroke . Similar to coﬁlin rod formation , we observed a time - dependent increase in apoptotic cells ( TUNEL + ) which Fig . 3 . Neuronal loss in cortical core and penumbra areas was time - dependent after tMCAO .

Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 69 plateaued 24 h after reperfusion ( Fig . 5A , B ) . Statistical results in Fig . 5C – D showed that apoptotic cells occurred in the MCAO area and increased until 24 h , followed by a gradual decrease 7 d after tMCAO , speciﬁcally in the cortical core area , similar to results reported previously ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , increase in number of apoptotic cells occurred parallel to increased coﬁlin rod density after tMCAO , which was gradually increased until 24 h fol - lowing recovery by 7 d . This further prompted the investigation of the relationship between coﬁlin rod for - mation and TUNEL + cell density . Indeed , a signiﬁcant positive rela - tionship was observed between rod formation and ischemic cell apoptosis ( Fig . 5E , core : r 2 = 0 . 54 , F = 25 . 55 , p < 0 . 001 ; penumbra : r 2 = 0 . 51 , F = 22 . 61 , p < 0 . 001 ) . These data indicated a possibly important role for coﬁlin in cell apoptosis after stroke . Inhibition of coﬁlin by Limk1 reduced coﬁlin rod formation and MAP2 degradation 24 h after tMCAO Activated Limk1 phosphorylates ( inactivates ) coﬁlin at Ser3 . Numerous studies over the years have shown that the activated non phosphorylated coﬁlin , which is translocated to the mitochondria , is essential for induction of apoptosis in vitro ( Chua et al . , 2003 ; Posadas et al . , 2012 ; Alhadidi et al . , 2016 ; Madineni et al . , 2016 ) . In PC12 cells for example , overexpression of Limk1 protects cells from serum - induced apoptosis by inacti - vating coﬁlin and inhibiting cas - pase 3 ( Yang et al . , 2004 ) . To further corroborate the eﬀect of coﬁlin on neuronal apoptosis after stroke in vivo , we over - expressed RFP - Limk1 via lentivirus into the cortical penumbra , using RFP - Ctrl rats as controls 7 d before tMCAO . Imunnohistochemical data shown in Fig . 6A – D demonstrated that the density of coﬁlin rod was signiﬁcantly decreased in the Fig . 4 .

Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 RFP - Limk1 - injected animals ( 97 . 6 ± 27 . 2 / mm 2 , n = 6 ; p < 0 . 001 ) 24 h after tMCAO , compared with RFP - Ctrl injected rats ( 346 . 5 ± 36 . 8 / mm 2 , n = 6 ) . Simultaneously , the degradation of MAP2 as observed by immunohisto - chemical detection was also found to be attenuated by LIMK1 overexpression ( Fig . 6E , from RFP - Ctrl : 100 ± 4 . 9 % ; to RFP - Limk1 : 158 . 9 ± 19 . 6 % ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Col - lectively , these results suggest that phosphorylation of coﬁlin by Limk1 in vivo could partially but signiﬁcantly reduce coﬁlin rod formation and MAP2 degradation fol - lowing ischemic stroke . Inhibition of coﬁlin by Limk1 attenuated coﬁlin mediated - apoptosis 24 h after tMCAO After successful inhibition of activated coﬁlin protein in the previous experiments , we next performed a double immunostaining of RFP with TUNEL to evaluate the eﬀect of this inhibition on cell apoptosis . Interestingly , cells positively labeled for RFP ( indicating over - expression of Limk1 ) showed almost no co - localization with TUNEL positive cells in Fig . 7A , B . Further , quantitative assessment ( Fig . 7C ) revealed a signiﬁcant decrease of ischemia - induced apoptosis after Limk1 over - expression ( 8 . 9 ± 3 . 9 / mm 2 , n = 6 ; p < 0 . 05 ) , in comparison with the RFP - control - injected animals ( 64 . 5 ± 8 . 8 / mm 2 , n = 6 ) . Such ﬁndings clariﬁed that Limk1 - mediated coﬁlin phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis after ischemic stroke . DISCUSSION In this study , we demonstrated a critical role for coﬁlin during ischemic stroke . It has been presented that coﬁlin rod formation signiﬁcantly increased from 2 h in the cortical core area ( 8 h in the penumbra ) , peaking at 24 h and diminishing subsequently 7 d after tMCAO . Coﬁlin aggregation was parallel with ischemic apoptosis and inversely correlated with MAP2 intensity . Furthermore , inhibition of coﬁlin activation by Limk1 over - expression showed a signiﬁcant reduction of coﬁlin rod formation , MAP2 degradation and cell apoptosis in the penumbral area ( Fig . 7D ) . Together , these results illustrated clearly that coﬁlin was important for rod formation and cell apoptosis in the ischemic brain after stroke . The neuronal nuclei marker NeuN has been widely validated as an excellent marker for mature neurons Fig . 5 . Time course quantiﬁcation of TUNEL - positive cells in infarct area of tMCAO rats .

Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 71 throughout the central nervous system , including the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , thalamus , cerebellum and spinal cord . It is strictly expressed in the nucleus and cell body of mature neurons and not in glial cells . Immunoreactivity of NeuN and TTC staining have been used extensively for in the study of the evolving phases of infarction in rats subjected tMCAO ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . In the present study , NeuN staining showed that neuronal loss is increased from 2 h to 24 h after tMCAO , stabilizing between 24 h and 7 d subsequently , and a ﬁnding which was similar to observed TTC staining patterns . The results are in line with other work , in which the occurrence of neuronal loss was associated with the increase of infarct volume after ischemic stroke ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . The cytoskeleton is composed of three polymers— microtubules , actin , and intermediate ﬁlaments—which are structurally , morphologically , and functionally distinct from each other and have unique and dynamic properties which are important for their individual functions ( Mohan and John , 2015 ) . The extent of neu - ronal injury in stroke may also be identiﬁed by an attenu - ation of MAP2 protein . MAP2 is the most abundant microtubule - associated protein that regulates the struc - ture and function of the cytoskeleton . MAP2 , mainly expressed in the dendrites and in the neuronal cell body , can interact directly with both microtubules and F - actin , both of which have been mapped to its microtubule - binding - repeat domain ( Dehmelt and Halpain , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 2012 ) . In the present study , MAP2 was demon - strably decreased in infarcted brain areas , reaching mini - mal expression at 7 d . This ﬁnding was in accordance with earlier reports on MAP2 alterations during stroke ( Popp et al . , 2009 ; Hartig et al . , 2016 ) . Members of the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin family were ﬁrst identiﬁed by James Bamburg in 1980 , due to their ability to bind to both monomeric globular ( G ) - actin and ﬁlamentous ( F ) - actin ( Bamburg et al . , 1980 ) . There are three isoforms in most mammalian animals , including the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF , also known as destrin ) , coﬁlin - 1 ( non - muscle coﬁlin , n - coﬁlin ) and coﬁlin - 2 ( muscle coﬁlin , m - coﬁlin ) ( Maciver and Hussey , 2002 ) , all of which are highly conserved ( 70 – 82 % ) and share identical genes . Both ADF and coﬁlin - 1 ( simply coﬁlin ) are especially abundant in the brain where coﬁlin - 1is the dominant isoform ( Bellenchi et al . , 2007 ) . Coﬁlin , a small protein ( 18 – 19 kDa ) , is an actin - binding protein and a major actin depolymerization factor in the central nervous system . Accumulating evidence indicates that coﬁlin is a functional node in Fig . 6 . Inhibition of coﬁlin by Limk1 reduced coﬁlin rod formation and MAP2 degradation 24 h after tMCAO .

Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 actin ﬁlament dynamics and may prompt reorganization by promoting actin assembly or disassembly ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . The central function of coﬁlin is dependent on the ratio of coﬁlin to actin ( Meberg and Bamburg , 2000 ; Takemura et al . , 2009 ) . At low coﬁlin / actin ratios , coﬁlin acts to sever actin ﬁlaments , whereas at high coﬁlin to actin ratios , coﬁlin nucleates actin assembly and stabi - lizes F - actin ( Meberg and Bamburg , 2000 ; Takemura et al . , 2009 ) . A high coﬁlin / F - actin ratio , coﬁlin dephos - phorylation and / or coﬁlin oxidation are three major mech - anisms of coﬁlin rod formation . The formation of coﬁlin rods ( containing 1 : 1 coﬁlin : actin ) has been studied in cul - tured mammalian neurons treated with excessive gluta - mate , ATP - D or oxidative stress , conditions which simulate the pathologies occurring during ischemic stroke . Thereby , a transient middle cerebral artery occlu - sion ( tMCAO ) model was established to examine whether coﬁlin rod formation was altered in response to ischemic stroke in vivo . As shown in Fig . 4 , coﬁlin rods were pre - sent in both the infarct core area and in the penumbra , which was consistent with our hypothesis . Interestingly , the changes in coﬁlin rod formation were inversely corre - lated with MAP2 intensity . Together , these data suggest that a progressive accumulation of coﬁlin rods may grad - ually induce MAP2 degradation in the infarct cortex after stroke . Recently , a second function of coﬁlin has been demonstrated following its translocation into the mitochondria from cytoplasm where it plays a pivotal role in the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and subsequent release of cytochrome c , the initiation of apoptosis ( Chua et al . , 2003 ; Posadas et al . , 2012 ; Alhadidi et al . , 2016 ; Madineni et al . , 2016 ) . Numerous studies over the years have indicated that coﬁ - lin mitochondrial translocation follows staurosporine induction of apoptosis in a neuroblastoma cells ( Chua et al . , 2003 ) . Additionally , mitochondrial translocation of coﬁlin is required for AITC - mediated cell death via the ROCK1 / PTEN / PI3K signaling pathway ( Li et al . , 2013 ) . Further , mitochondrial translocation of oxidized coﬁlin induces caspase - independent necrotic - like programmed cell death of T cells ( Wabnitz et al . , 2010 ) . Our data showed that ischemia - induced apoptotic changes occurred parallel to changes in coﬁlin rod density , gradu - ally increasing for 24 h and subsequently normalizing by 7 d . Taken together , these results and previous reports sug - gested the importance of coﬁlin in cell apoptosis after ischemic stroke . Coﬁlin - actin rods are induced by stimuli that increase dephosphorylated ( active ) coﬁlin , interestingly , only dephosphorylated coﬁlin has been implicated in mitochondrial translocation . Coﬁlin is inactivated by Fig . 7 . Inhibition of coﬁlin by Limk1 attenuated coﬁlin mediated - apoptosis 24 h after tMCAO .

Chen et al . / Neuroscience 444 ( 2020 ) 64 – 75 73 LIMK - mediated phosphorylation , and reactivated by SSH / chronophin - mediated dephosphorylation at its serine - 3 ( Ser3 ) residue ( Mizuno , 2013 ) . In PC12 cells , overexpres - sion of Limk1 protects cells from serum - induced apopto - sis by inactivating coﬁlin and inhibiting caspase 3 ( Yang et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , when coﬁlin expression was decreased by siRNA - mediated gene knockdown , cyto - chrome c release and apoptosis execution were strongly inhibited ( Madineni et al . , 2016 ) . To further corroborate the role of activated coﬁlin in ischemic stroke , our results revealed that inhibition of coﬁlin by Limk1 over - expression reduced coﬁlin rod formation and MAP2 degradation , and consequently , attenuated coﬁlin mediated - apoptosis 24 h after tMCAO . Based on the present data , we summarized that coﬁlin was particularly important for rod formation and cell apoptosis in the ischemic brain after stroke . In conclusion , the results of the present study demonstrated that ischemic stroke in vivo and in vitro induced coﬁlin rod formation and neuronal apoptosis . Furthermore , inhibition of coﬁlin activation by Limk1 over - expression showed a signiﬁcant reduction of coﬁlin rod formation , MAP2 degradation and coﬁlin mediated - apoptosis in the penumbral area 24 h after tMCAO . Together , these results illustrated the involvement of coﬁlin in the onset of ischemia - induced neuronal apoptosis , suggesting that coﬁlin may be a novel potential drug target for the treatment of ischemic stroke .
