The resulting actin polymerization powers the projection of the plasma mem - brane in lamellipodia and membrane rufﬂes . The Wave proteins are always found associated with partner proteins . The canonical Wave complex is a stable complex containing ﬁve subunits . Even though it is well admitted that this complex plays an essential regulatory role on Wave function , the mechanisms by which Wave pro - teins are regulated within the complex are still elusive . Even the constitutive activity or inactivity of the complex is controversial . The major difﬁculty of these assays resides in the long and difﬁcult puriﬁcation of the Wave complex by a combination of several chromatography steps , which gives an overall low yield and increases the chance of Wave complex denaturation . Here we report a greatly simpliﬁed approach to purify the human Wave complex using a stable cell line expressing a tagged sub - unit and afﬁnity chromatography . This protocol provided us with sufﬁcient amount of pure Wave complex for functional assays . These assays unambiguously estab - lished that the Wave complex in its native conformation is intrinsically inactive , indicating that , like WASP proteins , Wave proteins have a masked C - terminal Arp2 / 3 binding site at resting state . As a consequence , the Wave complex has to be recruited and activated at the plasma membrane to project migration structures . Importantly , the approach we describe here for multiprotein complex puriﬁcation is likely applicable to a wide range of human multiprotein complexes . Cell Motil . Cytoskeleton 2009 .

DOI : 10 . 1002 / cm . 20342 ' 2009 Wiley - Liss , Inc . Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton ( 2009 ) INTRODUCTION Cell migration involves actin polymerization at the front of the cell . Actin polymerization plays an essential role in powering the projection of the plasma membrane in structures such as lamellipodia and rufﬂes [ Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ] . Most of this actin polymerization is contributed by the Arp2 / 3 complex , which nucleates actin ﬁlaments off preexisting ﬁlaments [ Pollard , 2007 ] . This process induces the formation of an array of branched actin ﬁlaments . The Arp2 / 3 complex is intrinsi - cally inactive and needs to be activated by Nucleation Promoting Factors ( NPFs ) . NPFs are characterized by a C - terminal WCA domain ( WH2 - Connector - Acidic ) . The WCA domain binds actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex and is sufﬁcient to trigger Arp2 / 3 dependent actin polymeriza - tion in vitro . Wave proteins are the major NPFs in lamellipodia and rufﬂes . Wave proteins are localized at the tip of these structures [ Miki et al . , 1998 ; Hahne et al . , 2001 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ] . Genetic inac - tivation of Wave genes in the mouse impairs their forma - tion [ Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ] . Mamma - lian cells express three genes encoding Wave proteins ( also known as Scar proteins ) . Wave2 is the most ubiqui - tous protein , whereas Wave1 and Wave3 have more re - stricted expression patterns [ Sossey - Alaoui et al . , 2003 ] . Wave1 and Wave3 are well expressed in the brain . Inter - estingly , in cells coexpressing Wave1 and 2 , a functional specialization was identiﬁed with Wave1 being required for the formation of dorsal rufﬂes and Wave2 for periph - eral rufﬂes [ Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ] . Formation of lamellipodia and rufﬂes is under the control of the small GTPase Rac . Wave proteins are essential downstream factors for this effect [ Miki et al . , 1998 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ] . But how Rac regulates Wave proteins is still unclear . IRSp53 , a protein bridging Rac to Wave2 has been ﬁrst isolated [ Miki et al . , 2000 ] . This protein directly binds membranes and might be able to sense or induce a spe - ciﬁc curvature of the plasma membrane [ Scita et al . , 2008 ] . A second route to connect Rac to Wave involves the so - called Wave complex . The puriﬁcation of Wave1 from brain has revealed that Wave1 was associated with four other subunits in the Wave complex [ Eden et al . , 2002 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ] . The puriﬁcation of Wave2 from HeLa cells revealed a similar complex [ Gautreau et al . , 2004 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ] . Wave3 also likely incorpo - rates into such a complex [ Stovold et al . , 2005 ] . Impor - tantly , these complexes contained the subunit CyFIP1 , also known as Sra1 ( Speciﬁcally Rac Associated - 1 ) , a previously known effector of Rac [ Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ] . In addition to Rac signalling , phosphorylation events also regulate Wave activity [ Kim et al . , 2006 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ] . To understand signaling through the Wave proteins , one must understand their off state , their on state and how they transit between these two states . Wave molecules in isolation activate the Arp2 / 3 complex in a constitutive manner [ Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Eden et al . , 2002 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ] . They differ in that respect from WASP molecules , which are autoinhibited through an intramolecular interaction masking their C - terminal Arp2 / 3 binding site [ Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ] . Regulation of Wave activity relies on its multiprotein complex . This multiprotein complex behaves as a biochemical entity , since depletion of one subunit through RNAi or genetic inactivation leads to degradation of the remaining subunits , in a variety of plant and animal organisms [ Blagg et al . , 2003 ; Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ; Le et al . , 2006 ; Derivery et al . , 2008 ] . The Wave1 complex puriﬁed from brain was reported to be inactive , and to dis - sociate upon GTP - bound Rac addition , thus releasing active Wave1 [ Eden et al . , 2002 ] . According to these results , partner subunits have a primary inhibitory role on Wave activity . The activation model was however chal - lenged by the lack of dissociation of the Wave2 complex in cell - free extract upon active Rac addition [ Innocenti et al . , 2004 ] . Moreover , all subunits of the Wave2 com - plex are localized at the lamellipodium tip , where Wave proteins are active [ Steffen et al . , 2004 ] . These controver - sial ﬁndings could simply indicate that the activation mechanism of Wave2 is different from the one of Wave1 , but actually even the intrinsic inactivity of the Wave com - plex was challenged . The global architecture of the Wave2 complex has been deciphered [ Gautreau et al . , 2004 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ] . Sequential addition of Wave2 complex subunits modulates but does not suppress Wave2 activity [ Innocenti et al . , 2004 ] . Furthermore , puriﬁed Wave1 complex from brain was recently found to be active , contrary to the original observation [ Kim et al . , 2006 ] . These results suggested that the Wave complex was intrinsically active and was recruited from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in an already active form . This idea was tested by fractionating cells and by assaying immunoprecipitated Wave2 from cytosolic and mem - brane fractions . The cytosolic pool of the Wave complex was inactive whereas the membrane pool was active [ Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ] . This observation contradicts the proposed constitutive activity of the Wave complex . To recapitulate , the Wave complex was inactive in two publications [ Eden et al . , 2002 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ] and active in two others [ Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ] . To understand the molecular mecha - nisms of Wave activation during cell migration , one needs ﬁrst to solve this controversy on the intrinsic activ - ity of the Wave complex . We thus chose this objective , 2 Derivery et al . while trying to understand where discrepancies might come from . Combination of different paralogous subunits cre - ates a diverse repertoire of Wave complexes . The canon - ical Wave complex contains : (cid:1) the CyFIP1 subunit , or its paralogous protein CyFIP2 ( also known as PIR121 ) ; (cid:1) the Nap1 subunit , or its paralogous protein Hem1 in hematopoietic cells ; (cid:1) one of the three Wave subunit ; (cid:1) the Abi1 subunit , or one of its paralogous pro - tein , Abi2 or NESH ; and (cid:1) the Brk1 subunit ( also known as Hspc300 ) , which is the only one that does not have a paral - ogous protein in any species examined . Just the combination of the paralogous subunits can create as many as 36 different pentameric com - plexes , but the Abi genes provide an additional source of complexity due to their extensive alternative splicing [ Ziemnicka - Kotula et al . , 1998 ] . Wave complexes puri - ﬁed from a tissue or even a single cell line are thus a mixture of Wave complexes assembled from the expressed paralogous subunits [ Eden et al . , 2002 ; Gau - treau et al . , 2004 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ] . If the diversity of mammalian Wave complexes certainly increase the possible ways to regulate the three Wave activities , it is also a likely cause of discrepancies . The other potential pitfall in studying multiprotein complexes comes from their puriﬁcation . To purify en - dogenous multiprotein complexes from cells or tissues , many steps of chromatography are typically required and this gives an overall low yield . For the Wave1 and 2 complexes , between four and eight steps are required [ Eden et al . , 2002 ; Gautreau et al . , 2004 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ] . The combination of several steps in different physico – chemical conditions , in a procedure that lasts several days , increases the likelihood of denaturation . An alternative to the puriﬁcation of an endogenous com - plex is the reconstitution of this complex from recombi - nant proteins . This approach is also long and difﬁcult . Moreover , a reconstitution is successful when it provides a recombinant multiprotein complex that behaves like the native complex . The native behavior in the case of the Wave complex is precisely unclear and represents our goal . So we decided to choose an intermediate approach , where a recombinant tagged subunit is expressed in a stable cell line and the endogenous com - plex assembled around this recombinant subunit is puri - ﬁed efﬁciently and rapidly by afﬁnity chromatography . Using this strategy , we report here a greatly improved protocol for Wave complex puriﬁcation . We found that the puriﬁed Wave complex is inactive . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids All mammalian expression plasmids were derived from pCDNA5 / FRT / V5 - His ( Invitrogen ) . All the Open Reading Frames ( ORFs ) were derived from human cDNAs and ﬂanked by FseI and AscI sites for easy shut - tling between compatible plasmids . CyFIP1 ( GenBank accession no . XM 039225 ) , Nap1 ( GenBank accession no . AB011159 ) , Wave2 ( GenBank accession no . AB026542 ) , and Brk1 ( GenBank accession no . BC019303 ) were previously described [ Gautreau et al . , 2004 ] . Abi1 _ 1 ( GenBank accession no . BC024254 ) was ampliﬁed by PCR from cDNA clone IMAGE : 3531592 , Abi1 _ 2 ( GenBank accession no . FJ380057 ) was ampli - ﬁed from cDNA clone IMAGE : 5288756 , Abi1 _ 3 ( Gen - Bank accession no . FJ380058 ) was ampliﬁed from cDNA clone IMAGE : 4825581 , Abi1 _ 4 ( GenBank acces - sion no . FJ380059 ) was ampliﬁed from an HeLa library of cDNA . These plasmids tag the ORF in its N - terminus by either FLAG - HA ( MDYKDDDDK - YPYDVPDYA ) or by PC ( MEDQVDPRLIDGKEFDGRP ) followed by a TEV binding and cleavage site ( DYDIPTTENLYFQG ) . The V5 - His tags in the C - terminus were not translated because of the natural stop codon of the ORFs kept before the AscI site . All constructs were veriﬁed by sequencing both strands of DNA . Full length human Wave2 was also cloned in a pET28 vector , tagging the protein by a N - terminal ( His ) 6 peptide , for bacterial expression . pGEX Rac1 Q61L and Nck SH3 . 1 were kindly provided by Alan Hall ( Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center ) and Bruce Mayer ( University of Con - necticut Health Center ) , respectively . Cell Culture Flp - In TM T - REx TM 293 cells ( Invitrogen ) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS . The sta - ble expression of Tet Repressor was not used in this study and thus was not selected for using blasticidin . They were transfected using standard calcium phosphate method . Brieﬂy , 250 , 000 cells ( plated the day before ) were cotransfected with 1 l g of pOG44 plasmid ( Invi - trogen ) and 0 . 2 l g of plasmid of interest . Stable transfec - tants obtained by homologous recombination at the Flp - In site were selected using 200 l g (cid:2) mL 2 1 Hygrogold ( Invitrogen ) . Large scale cultures were grown using 2 L spinner ﬂasks ( Techne ) in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 100 l g (cid:2) mL 2 1 Hygrogold and 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin . Brieﬂy , eight 15 - cm dishes of cells were grown up to 90 % conﬂuency , trypsinized and diluted into 1 L of medium in one spinner . Three days after , cul - ture was splitted into four spinners and volume was adjusted to 1 L . Two days after , volume was adjusted to 1 . 5 L and after two more days , cells were harvested , The Wave Complex is Intrinsically Inactive 3 washed in XB buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM KCl , pH 7 . 7 ) . Cell pellets were then thrown into liquid nitrogen and stored frozen at 2 80 8 C . SDS - PAGE and Western Blot SDS - PAGE was performed using NuPAGE 4 – 12 % Bis - Tris gels ( Invitrogen ) and MES running buffer . Gels were transferred on nitrocellulose membranes according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Western blots were revealed using HRP coupled antibodies , Supersignal kit ( Pierce ) and a Fuji LAS - 3000 ( Fujiﬁlm ) . Colloidal Coo - massie blue ( Invitrogen ) was used for total protein stain - ing of the gel . Protein concentrations were determined after SDS - PAGE using densitometry of the bands and puriﬁed actin as a standard . Quantiﬁcations were per - formed with Image J software . Antibodies A rabbit polyclonal antibody ( W2C ) targeting the last 15 amino - acids of human Wave2 ( SEDDSSEF - DEDDWSD ) , the Acidic domain , was generated ( Zymed ) and puriﬁed by afﬁnity with the immunogenic peptide . Afﬁnity puriﬁed polyclonal antibodies targeting peptides derived from Wave2 ( W2 ) , Sra1 , and speciﬁcally an alternative exon of a long Abi1 isoform ( peptide SSGGYRRTPSV ) were previously described [ Gautreau et al . , 2004 ] . A serum obtained after immunization with peptide HGNNQPARTGTLSRTNP present in many Abi1 isoforms was kindly provided by Ann Marie Pendergast [ Courtney et al . , 2000 ] . Abi2 ( P20 ) polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz . FLAG M2 mAb was from Sigma . Puriﬁcation of Recombinant Proteins Unless stated otherwise , all puriﬁcation steps were performed at 4 8 C . ( His ) 6 - tagged full length Wave2 expression in E coli BL21 ( DE3 ) Star strain ( Invitrogen ) was induced for 2 h at 20 8 C with 1 mM IPTG . Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 8 . 0 ) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Sigma ) . After sonica - tion and centrifugation ( 10 , 000 3 g , 30 min ) , the super - natant was incubated with Ni - NTA resin ( Qiagen ) , washed in ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM im - idazole , pH 8 . 0 ) then eluted in ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 250 mM imidazole , pH 8 . 0 ) . Fractions con - taining the protein were pooled , dyalized against PBS , ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 2 80 8 C until use . GST - Rac1 L61 ( active mutant ) was produced and puriﬁed in E . coli as fusions with GST , and then Rac1 was cleaved off GST using thrombin as previously described [ Haeusler et al . , 2006 ] . GST and GST fused to the ﬁrst SH3 domain of Nck ( GST - Nck SH3 . 1 ) were puriﬁed in E . coli using a standard protocol . Puriﬁcation of Tagged Wave Complexes For small scale puriﬁcation of FLAG - HA tagged Wave complexes , two 15 cm - dishes of 293 cells ( 6 3 10 7 cells ) were lysed in 1 mL of RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % DOC , 0 . 1 % SDS , pH 7 . 7 ) supplemented with Protease In - hibitor Cocktail ( 1 : 1000 , Sigma ) and AEBSF 1 mM ( Interchim ) . The extract was clariﬁed by centrifugation ( 20 , 000 3 g , 10 min ) then incubated with 20 l L of FLAG M2 agarose beads ( Sigma ) for 4 h with rocking . After two washes in RIPA and 2 washes in XB ( 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM KCl , pH 7 . 7 ) , proteins were eluted in 20 l L of XB supplemented with 0 . 1 mg / mL of 3 3 FLAG peptide ( Sigma ) overnight , and then analyzed by SDS PAGE . For large scale puriﬁcation of FLAG - tagged Wave complexes , 6 L of 293 cells expressing FLAG - Abi1 _ 4 ( 10 10 cells , about 20 mL of cell pellet ) were lysed in 30 mL of RIPA buffer supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( 1 : 500 ) and AEBSF 2 mM and rocked for 1 h at 4 8 C . The extract was clariﬁed by centrifugation ( 3300 g , 10 min ) and ultracentrifugation ( 200 , 000 3 g , 1 h ) . The extract was ﬁltered through a 0 . 45 l m ﬁlter ( Millipore ) then applied on a column containing 1 mL of FLAG - M2 agarose beads with recirculation for 4 h at 4 8 C . Beads were washed extensively with 50 mL of RIPA , 50 mL of XB , then 50 mL of ( 50 mM PIPES , 150 mM KCl pH 6 . 8 ) . Several elutions were then performed by mixing the resin and 1 mL of the appropriate buffer . The ﬁrst elution was done in ( 50 mM PIPES , 150 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( 1 : 1000 ) , 0 . 1 mg / mL 3 3 FLAG peptide , pH 6 . 8 ) , the second in ( 50 mM PIPES , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , pH 6 . 8 ) and the last two in ( 50 mM PIPES , 1 mM DTT , pH 6 . 8 ) . Each elution was per - formed by rocking the slurry ( 30 min at 17 8 C then over - night at 4 8 C for the ﬁrst one , 10 min at 4 8 C for the others ) and centrifuging at 300 3 g for 1 min . Elution fractions were then pooled , giving a ﬁnal KCl concentra - tion of 50 mM . This eluate was then clariﬁed ( 100 , 000 3 g , 30 min ) and applied on a miniS PC 3 . 2 / 3 column driven by a Smart System ( Pharmacia ) . Elution was per - formed using a linear gradient between ( 50 mM PIPES , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , pH 6 . 8 ) and ( 50 mM PIPES , 2 M KCl , 1 mM DTT , pH 6 . 8 ) . For analytical gel ﬁltration analysis , 20 l L of the miniS peak ( roughly 20 l g of Wave complex ) was loaded on a Superdex 200 PC 3 . 2 / 3 column driven by a Smart System ( Pharmacia ) at a ﬂow rate of 40 l L s 2 1 in PBS . The stability assay for the Wave complex was performed with 20 l L of FLAG elu - ate in different buffers . Each immunoprecipitation was performed using about 6 3 10 7 cells expressing FLAG - Abi1 _ 4 . The eluates were then spun in the TLA100 rotor at 40 , 000 rpm for 30 min . Apparent K factor for centri - fuging 20 l L at 40 , 000 rpm in this rotor is 24 . 25 . This K 4 Derivery et al . factor implies that 2 . 2 h are required to pellet the native Wave complex of 11 S . Thus the pellet after the 30 min spin contains only aggregated Wave complex . Superna - tant and pellets were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coo - massie staining . For large scale puriﬁcation of PC - tagged Wave complex , 3 L of cells expressing PC - TEV - Abi1 _ 4 ( 5 3 10 9 cells , 10 mL of cell pellet ) were lysed in 40mL of ( 50 mM Hepes , 200 mM NaCl , 1mM CaCl2 , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 , 5 % DOC , 0 . 1 % SDS , 5 % glycerol , pH 7 . 7 ) supple - mented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( 1 : 500 ) and AEBSF 2 mM and rocked for 1 h at 4 8 C . The extract was clariﬁed by centrifugation ( 3300 g , 10 min ) and ultracentrifugation ( 200 , 000 3 g , 1 h ) . After ﬁltration through a 0 . 45 l m ﬁlter ( Millipore ) , the extract was applied on a column containing 1 mL of Protein C afﬁn - ity beads ( Roche ) with recirculation for 4 h . Beads were washed extensively with 50 mL of lysis buffer , 50 mL of ( 50 mM Hepes , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 20 % glyc - erol , pH 7 . 7 ) , 50 mL of ( 50 mM Hepes , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 20 % glycerol , pH 7 . 7 ) , 50 mL of ( 50 mM Hepes , 200 mM NaCl , 20 % glycerol , pH 7 . 7 ) . Several elutions were then performed by mixing the resin with 1mL of ( 50 mM Hepes , 200 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 20 % glycerol , pH 7 . 7 ) . Each elution was performed by rocking the slurry ( overnight at 4 8 C for the ﬁrst one , 10 min at 4 8 C for the other ones ) then centrifuging at 300 3 g for 1 min . Elution fractions were pooled and concen - trated on Amicon ultra ( MWCO 3 kDa , Millipore ) . Molecular Mass of the Wave Complex Molecular mass was determined from the experi - mentally measured Stokes’ radius and sedimentation value using the Siegel and Monty equation [ Siegel and Monty , 1966 ] : M ¼ 6 p h NaS = ð 1 (cid:3) v q Þ ; where M is the molecular mass in Da ( g (cid:2) mol 2 1 ) ; h is the viscosity of the medium , approximated by water , 1 . 002 3 10 2 2 g (cid:2) cm 2 1 (cid:2) sec 2 1 ; N is Avogadro’s number , 6 . 022 3 10 23 mol 2 1 ; a is the Stokes’ radius ( A˚ , i . e . 10 2 8 cm ) ; S is the sedimentation value ( S en Svedberg , 10 2 13 s ) ; v is the partial speciﬁc volume , 0 . 725 cm 3 (cid:2) g 2 1 ; q is the density of medium , 0 . 998 g (cid:2) cm 2 3 . Mass Spectrometry Gel slices were reduced , alkylated and subjected to digestion with trypsin ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Extracted peptides were dried and resolubilized in solvent A ( 95 / 5 water / acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) formic acid ) . The total digestion product of a gel slice was used per LC - MS / MS analysis . The extracted peptides were concentrated and separated on a LC - Packings system ( Dionex S . A . ) coupled to the nano - electrospray II ionisation interface of a QSTAR Pulsar i ( Applied Biosystems ) using a Pico - Tip ( 10 l m i . d . , New Objectives ) . HPLC mobile phases contained for solvent A and for solvent B ( 20 / 80 : water / acetonitrile in 0 . 085 % ( w / v ) formic acid ) . Bound pepti - des were eluted with a gradient of 5 – 50 % of solvent B in 60 min . Information - dependent acquisition was used to acquire MS / MS data , with experiments designed such as the two most abundant peptides were subject to colli - sion - induced dissociation , using nitrogen as collision gas , every 5 s . Data were searched using MASCOT ( Ma - trix Science ) software on the NCBI nr Human database . All data were manually veriﬁed in order to minimize errors in protein identiﬁcation and characterization . Pyrene - Actin Polymerization Assay Actin polymerization was followed by changes in pyrene ﬂuorescence using a Xenius SAFAS ﬂuorimeter ( Safas SA , Monaco ) . Actin was isolated from rabbit skel - etal muscle acetone powder as described [ Spudich and Watt , 1971 ] and stored in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 , and 0 . 1 mM DTT 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex was puriﬁed as described [ Egile et al . , 1999 ] or purchased from Cytoskeleton . Brieﬂy , MgATP - G - actin was prepared by incubating CaATP - G - actin ( 10 l M , 10 % pyrene labeled ) in G buffer with 200 l M EGTA and 20 l M MgCl 2 for 5 min on ice . The resulting MgATP - G - actin was used within 1 h . Polymerization of 2 . 5 l M MgATP - G - actin was initi - ated by the addition of one - tenth volume of 10 3 KMEI ( 500 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , and 100 mM imidazole - HCl , pH 7 . 0 ) . For the control curves , an equal amount of buffer without protein was always included . Handling of data and design of graphs was performed using Kaleidagraph v3 . 6 software ( Synergy Software , Reading , PA ) . Immunoprecipitations One microgram of native or denatured PC tagged Wave complex diluted in 1 mL of buffer A ( Hepes 50 mM , KCl 100 mM , pH 7 . 7 ) was immunoprecipitated with 3 l g of non immune Rabbit IgG , W2 or W2C anti - bodies and 10 l L of Protein G beads ( Pierce ) during 2 h of rocking at 4 8 C . Beads were washed four times with 1 mL of buffer A and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . RESULTS Characterization of Stable Cell Lines Expressing Tagged Subunits of the Wave Complex To purify efﬁciently the Wave complex assembled around a tagged subunit , we ﬁrst decided to compare the different tagged subunits for their ability to incorporate The Wave Complex is Intrinsically Inactive 5 into the endogenous Wave complex . We focused on the so - called ubiquitous Wave complex , the major Wave complex expressed by Hela cells [ Gautreau et al . , 2004 ] . So we cloned CyFIP1 , Nap1 , Wave2 , Abi1 , and Brk1 into a plasmid encoding a fusion with the two epitope tags FLAG and HA . In this study , the presence of the HA epitope was not used , but it potentially allows Tandem Afﬁnity Puriﬁcation , as previously described [ Groisman et al . , 2003 ] . Because Abi1 is spliced alterna - tively , we decided to compare four different splice var - iants obtained as cDNAs of genes expressed in different tissues or HeLa cells . With this series of constructs , we obtained a collection of stable cell lines derived from 293 cells using homologous recombination . As a result , all tagged subunits are expressed from a single well expressed locus . To check whether these tagged subunits were able to integrate into the endogenous Wave com - plex , we performed immunoprecipitations from the col - lection of lines using FLAG mAb followed by elution using 3 3 FLAG peptide competition . The eluates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining ( Fig . 1A ) . All eluates displayed the characteristic pattern of the Wave complex with the high molecular weight dou - blet CyFIP and Nap1 . It should be noted that the differ - ent cell lines grew at somewhat different rates and de - spite an attempt to equalize the number of cells used for this experiment , the immunoprecipitation from the dif - ferent lines was not performed with an equivalent num - ber of cells . As a consequence , this experiment was not the basis to select the best cell line for Wave complex puriﬁcation . Nonetheless , this experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the puriﬁcation of Wave complexes tagged on any subunit . To select for the line producing the largest amount of tagged Wave complexes as a starting material for pu - riﬁcation , we ﬁrst compared their level of Wave2 . None of them displayed a signiﬁcantly increased level , sug - gesting that no single subunit is the limiting factor con - trolling the level of Wave complexes . We thus decided to estimate the proportion of Wave complexes associated with the tagged subunit or the endogenous one . The tagged subunit was depleted by a single round of immu - noprecipitation and the depleted lysates were compared to the initial lysates by the depletion of endogenous Wave2 . The highest depletion of Wave2 was obtained upon FLAG depletion of Abi1 _ 4 , the shortest splice vari - ant of Abi1 ( Fig . 1B ) . Interestingly , the expression of FLAG - Abi1 _ 4 replaced the endogenous Abi proteins , since both the major endogenous Abi1 , a longer isoform than Abi1 _ 4 , and Abi2 were profoundly down - regulated . This effect was obvious when initial lysates of cells expressing Abi1 isoforms were compared to the ones of cells expressing CyFIP1 or Nap1 . This ‘molecular replacement’ of endogenous subunits by the recombinant Fig . 1 . Characterization of stable 293 cell lines expressing FLAG - tagged subunits of the Wave complex . ( A ) Small - scale afﬁnity puriﬁ - cation of Wave complexes tagged on the different subunits . This Coo - massie stained gel of eluates from the FLAG afﬁnity resin indicates that all tagged subunits integrate into the Wave complex . The pres - ence of the Wave complex is best revealed by the high molecular weight subunits CyFIP and Nap1 . The positions of Wave , Abi and Brk1 are indicated , even though they are difﬁcult to see in small scale puriﬁcations . Abi1 _ 1 – _ 4 refers to four different splice variants of Abi1 . Note that the addition of the tag decreases slightly the electro - phoretic mobility of subunits . A variable number of FLAG beads were carried over in these small scale puriﬁcations as indicated by the light chain of the FLAG antibody ( IgLC ) . Positions of molecular markers ( in kDa ) are indicated on the left of the gel . ( B ) Analysis of subunit expression and depletion upon FLAG immunoprecipitation in differ - ent cell lines . Lysates before ( L ) or after FLAG depletion ( D ) were an - alyzed by western blot with the indicated antibodies . Abi1 was ana - lyzed both with an antibody recognizing all forms of Abi1 and an anti - body recognizing speciﬁcally an alternative exon of Abi1 present in long isoforms such as Abi1 _ 1 . The expression of all tagged subunits was detected with FLAG antibodies . A signiﬁcant depletion of endog - enous Wave2 was observed with all six constructs indicating that the tag was exposed in all cases . This depletion was estimated by densi - tometry and given in % below the western blot . FLAG - Abi1 _ 4 shows the best incorporation . Furthermore , expression of a particular Abi1 replaces endogenous Abi1 and Abi2 subunits . 6 Derivery et al . one probably reﬂects that unincorporated subunits are degraded and that endogenous subunits are overwhelmed by the recombinant one . The cell line expressing tagged Brk1 was not selected , because Brk1 forms a free pool in addition to the Wave complex [ Gautreau et al . , 2004 ] . The cell line expressing Wave2 grew signiﬁcantly slower than the others . For this reason , this line was not selected as a good starting material for Wave complex puriﬁcation . The cell line expressing Abi1 _ 4 appeared as the best starting material , because it grows well , tagged Abi1 _ 4 is very well integrated into the endogenous Wave com - plex , and this cell line has a simpliﬁed repertoire of expressed Abi subunits . Optimization of Wave Complex Puriﬁcation We next established the puriﬁcation protocol of the Wave complex from the 293 cell line expressing FLAG tagged Abi1 _ 4 . We grew several liters of this cell line in suspension using spinner bottles . A cell lysate was pre - pared and incubated with beads conjugated with the FLAG mAb . In this large scale immunoprecipitation , depletion of tagged Wave complexes was essentially complete but elution with the competing peptide proved to demand optimization . We found that temperature was a critical determinant of elution efﬁciency . Increasing the temperature promotes elution , but the temperature has to be maintained within a reasonnable range to avoid denaturation of the complex . We found that a 30 min incubation at 17 8 C following an overnight incubation at 4 8 C was a good trade - off , providing 75 % elution . The eluted material was obviously enriched in Wave com - plex , since its characteristic pattern could be clearly dis - tinguished ( Fig 2A , lane input ) , despite the presence of several contaminants in minor amounts . The repertoire of Wave complex subunits puriﬁed with FLAG - Abi1 _ 4 was analyzed by LC - MS / MS ( Table I ) . Both CyFIP1 and 2 were present . These two proteins are 87 % identical explaining why seven peptides were common . In addi - tion , 10 peptides were speciﬁc to CyFIP2 , and one was speciﬁc to CyFIP1 , suggesting that CyFIP2 was more abundant than CyFIP1 . The presence of Nap1 was con - ﬁrmed by 12 peptide and there was no peptide from its hematopoı¨etic speciﬁc paralogue Hem1 . A mixture of Wave1 and 2 was present . In the upper band of the dou - blet , Wave1 was represented by six peptides and Wave2 by only one . In the lower band of the doublet , the ratio was inverted with three peptides of Wave2 and a single one of Wave1 . Despite this enrichment of Wave1 in the upper band and of Wave2 in the lower band , the relative intensity of these two bands cannot be used as an indica - tor of the proportion between these two Wave paralogues , given that these proteins are subjected to band shifts upon phosphorylation . As expected , all the Abi peptides belonged to the tagged splice variant of Abi1 we expressed and puriﬁed . To further purify the Wave complex , we used an ion exchange column . The main contaminant in this preparation is the acidic 3 3 FLAG peptide . The FLAG eluate was thus loaded on a miniS cation exchange col - umn . The Wave complex was speciﬁcally retained but the 3 3 FLAG peptide went through . After elution with a linear gradient of salt , the Wave complex was highly puriﬁed and concentrated ( Fig . 2A ) . In two steps , FLAG afﬁnity and miniS , we obtained 180 l g of pure Wave complex from 10 10 cells ( 6 L culture ) . This amount of Wave complex is unprecedented in the litterature . For an analytical purpose , we performed size exclusion chroma - tography with this puriﬁed Wave complex . An aliquot fraction was loaded on a calibrated superdex - 200 col - umn . The ﬁve subunits eluted as expected as a single peak ( Fig . 2B ) . This peak eluted at a position corre - sponding to a Stokes’ radius of 77 A˚ . This Stokes’ radius together with the previously determined sedimentation coefﬁcient ( 11 S , [ Gautreau et al . , 2004 ] ) predicts a mo - lecular mass of 348 kDa ( see material and methods ) . This mass was in good agreement with the calculated mass of a complex containing a single molecule of each subunit , which ranges between 380 and 390 kDa depend - ing on the exact composition of paralogs . The smallest subunit Brk1 , 9 kDa , was actually shown previously to be a single molecule when bound to Wave2 , even though its free form is a trimer [ Derivery et al . , 2008 ] . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst experimental determination of the stoichiometry of Wave complex subunits . Despite the correct yield obtained with the FLAG afﬁnity followed by MiniS cation exchange column , we noticed variable losses of puriﬁed Wave complex , sug - gesting that the conditions used during this puriﬁcation procedure were not optimal for the stability of the Wave complex . This prompted us to examine the conditions of stability of the Wave complex . We assessed it by eluting the Wave complex with 3 3 FLAG peptide in different buffers and by ultracentrifuging the eluate in conditions where the native 11 S complex does not pellet . We found that the addition of 20 % glycerol improved the solubility of the Wave complex and that low salt conditions were particularly detrimental for Wave complex solubility ( data not shown ) . This last requisite precluded the use of the cation exchange column , which was nonetheless required to get rid of the competing 3 3 FLAG peptide . We thus decided to change the puriﬁcation tag . Instead of the FLAG epitope , we used a Protein C ( PC ) epitope . PC tagged proteins can be puriﬁed using a mAb that requires Ca 2 1 for binding and can thus be gently eluted by Ca 2 1 chelation using EGTA . The Wave Complex is Intrinsically Inactive 7 We derived a new 293 cell line expressing PC tagged Abi1 _ 4 . Using PC afﬁnity chromatography , we could deplete the lysate in tagged Wave complexes and elute 90 % of the bound material , while staying through - out the procedure at 4 8 C in the optimal physico - chemical conditions for Wave complex stability . In a single step , the Wave complex was about 90 % pure with a single additional band ( Fig . 2C ) . This band was identiﬁed as actin ( Table I ) . Actin is a physiologically relevant part - ner of the Wave complex . Using the PC afﬁnity protocol but not with the FLAG afﬁnity protocol , actin was retrieved in a stoichiometric proportion with the Wave complex . The yield of Wave complex puriﬁcation using the single PC afﬁnity step increased more than three times compared with the two step FLAG puriﬁcation , since we obtained 350 l g from only 5 3 10 9 cells ( 3 L culture ) . This puriﬁed Wave complex was used for func - tional assays . The Wave complex is Intrinsically Inactive To assay the activity of the Wave complex , we used the classical pyrene – actin assay in the presence of puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex . The Arp2 / 3 complex is intrinsically inactive and needs to be activated by a NPF . We ﬁrst compared the activity of the puriﬁed Wave com - plex to the one of recombinant Wave2 in isolation . Recombinant Wave2 potently activated actin polymer - ization , in agreement with previous experiments using Fig . 2 . Puriﬁcation of the Wave complex containing tagged Abi1 _ 4 . ( A ) FLAG afﬁnity puriﬁcation of the Wave complex was performed at a 100 - fold larger scale than in ﬁgure 1 . The eluate obtained after 3 3 FLAG peptide competition ( Input ) was run over a miniS cation exchange column and eluted with a gradient of KCl ( dashed line ) . This ion exchange step is essential to get rid of the 3 3 FLAG peptide that ﬂows through but is not stained by Coomassie . Proﬁles of absorb - ance at 280 nm ( dark line ) and at 260 nm ( gray line ) reveal a major protein peak . A Coomassie stained gel ( right panel ) , where input , ﬂow - through ( FT ) and peak fractions were analyzed , indicated that the Wave complex is responsible for this peak eluting at 200 mM KCl . ( B ) Analytical Size exclusion chromatography on a superdex 200 column further conﬁrms that the ﬁve proteins co - eluted from the the MiniS column form indeed a single complex . Positions of stand - ards is indicated by their Stokes’ radii in A˚ above the graph . The Stoke’s radius of the Wave complex was determined to be 77 A˚ . The ﬁve fractions of the peak were analyzed by Coomassie blue after SDS - PAGE in the right panel . ( C ) PC afﬁnity puriﬁcation of the Wave complex . 2 l g of puriﬁed complex was analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . With PC afﬁnity chromatography , actin was additionally retrieved .

The Wave Complex is Intrinsically Inactive 9 Fig . 3 . The Wave complex is intrinsically inactive . ( A ) Wave or Wave complex activity on puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex was monitored by pyrene ﬂuorescence of Mg - ATP actin .

( B ) The inactiv - ity of the Wave complex does not depend on the puriﬁcation tag or on freezing of cell pellets . FLAG - and PC - tagged were puriﬁed from fresh cells and assayed as in A . ( C ) Rac is not sufﬁcient to activate the Wave com - plex . Conditions : 200 nM RacQ61L , 43 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and as in A . Heat denatura - tion of the Wave complex revealed an activ - ity .

Puriﬁed Wave complexes were immunoprecipitated using either the W2 antibody targeting a pep - tide from the central region , or the W2C anti - body targeting the last 15 amino - acids of Wave2 , the acidic domain . The immunopreci - pitates were analyzed with Coomassie stain - ing ( upper panel ) and Wave2 western blot using W2 antibody ( lower panel ) . Upon dena - turation , none of the antibodies is able to immunoprecipitate Wave2 and other subunits of the Wave complex . ( F ) The W2C antibody blocks the activity of puriﬁed recombinant Wave2 . Conditions : 20 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and as in A . ( G ) The W2C antibody blocks the activity of denatured Wave complex . Conditions as in A . ( H ) Wave complex subu - nits aggregate after denaturation . 3 l g of puriﬁed Wave complex was subjected to heat treatment or not , centrifuged at low speed , and then total ( T ) , soluble ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . 10 Derivery et al . Wave1 or Wave2 [ Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Eden et al . , 2002 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ] . In sharp contrast , our puri - ﬁed Wave complex , which contains Wave1 or Wave2 , was completely inactive ( Fig . 3A ) . This important con - clusion was conﬁrmed using PC tagged Wave complex puriﬁed from cells , which were not frozen contrary to our standard protocol ( Fig . 3B ) . Moreover , FLAG tagged Wave complex was also found to be inactive when puri - ﬁed in optimal stability conditions , in which case the competing 3 3 FLAG peptide was still present . Rac in its GTP - bound form and the ﬁrst SH3 domain of the Nck adapter protein were reported to activate the puriﬁed Wave1 complex by a dissociation mechanism [ Eden et al . , 2002 ] . However , the addition of the puriﬁed GTPase defective mutant RacQ61L was unable to acti - vate our preparation of puriﬁed Wave complexes , despite the presence of Wave1 complexes ( Fig . 3C ) . This result is in line with more recent observations that Rac is not sufﬁcient to activate or dissociate the Wave2 complex [ Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ] . Similarly , the addition of the ﬁrst SH3 domain of Nck in fusion with GST did not activate our puriﬁed Wave complex signiﬁcantly , i . e . not more than GST alone that had a very weak effect ( Fig . 3D ) . These results suggest that Wave proteins are in a conformation , where their acidic Arp2 / 3 binding site is masked by an interaction within the Wave complex . This interaction is not abolished by Rac or Nck addition . Interestingly , the WCA domain of Wave proteins is pre - dicted to be intrinsically unstructured , unlike most of the rest of the complex ( http : / / iupred . enzim . hu / ) . Denatura - tion should not affect the activity of the WCA domain , i . e . its ability to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , but should release the WCA domain from its inhibitory interaction . We thus subjected our puriﬁed Wave complex to heat ( a 10 min incubation at 58 8 C ) and cooled it down to 4 8 C . This treatment indeed revealed an activity enhancing Arp2 / 3 mediated actin polymerization ( Figs . 3C and 3D ) . This experiment shows that counterintuitively , Wave activity can be revealed by denaturation of the Wave complex . To test experimentally the hypothesis that the acidic Arp2 / 3 binding site of Wave is masked within the complex and can be exposed upon heat treatment , we raised a polyclonal antibody , W2C , targeting the last 15 amino - acids of Wave2 and puriﬁed it by afﬁnity for the immunogenic peptide . We then compared this antibody to the previously described W2 antibody targeting an in - ternal peptide of Wave2 in the middle region linking the N - terminal Wave Homology Domain to the C - terminal WCA domain . Both antibodies did efﬁciently recognize denatured Wave2 in western blots ( data not shown ) . We then used both antibodies to immunoprecipitate puriﬁed native Wave complex . The W2 antibody , but not the W2C antibody efﬁciently immunoprecipitated the Wave complex , suggesting that indeed the C - terminus of the Wave2 molecule is masked in the native Wave complex ( Fig . 3E ) . It should be noted that we used conditions sim - ilar to the pyrene actin assay , in that no detergents were used , and this resulted in the immunoprecipitation experiment of a detectable background amount of Wave with non immune IgG beads . When the Wave complex was denatured by the heat treatment and then cooled down , surprisingly , not only the W2C antibody did not immunoprecipitate more Wave2 , but also the W2 anti - body ceased to immunoprecipitate . In pyrene – actin assays , the W2C blocked the activity of recombinant His - Wave2 ( Fig . 3F ) , as well as the activity revealed by heat denaturation of the Wave complex ( Fig . 3G ) . Note that the block observed with denatured Wave complex cannot be complete , since Wave1 is not recognized by the Wave2 speciﬁc W2C antibody . After heat denatura - tion , the Wave complex subunits were completely pel - leted by a 1 h centrifugation at 20 , 000 3 g in a table - top centrifuge ( Fig . 3H ) , This experiment indicates non spe - ciﬁc aggregation of the Wave complex subunits after denaturation . This aggregation likely explains why the Wave complex can not be immunoprecipitated even by the W2 antibody after heat treatment . However , the blocking experiment suggest that indeed the activity revealed by this treatment is due to exposure of WCA domains out of agregates . DISCUSSION We reported here a fast and efﬁcient puriﬁcation of the human Wave complex in mild conditions . When assayed in vitro , this material did not activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , indicating that the acidic Arp2 / 3 binding site of Wave1 or Wave2 contained in the complex is masked . This conclusion is corroborated by the lack of recogni - tion of the native conformation of Wave2 within its com - plex by an otherwise blocking antibody targeting the acidic Arp2 / 3 binding site . This important result is in line with Eden et al . reporting that the Wave1 complex is inactive [ Eden et al . , 2002 ] and in opposition with Kim et al . reporting active Wave1 complex at basal state [ Kim et al . , 2006 ] . In these experiments using puriﬁed endogenous Wave1 complex , denaturation occuring dur - ing the many chromatographical steps provides a possi - ble explanation for this discrepancy . Suetsugu et al . reported that the Wave complex immunoprecipitated from cytosol is inactive , in line with our ﬁndings that the Wave complex is intrinsically inactive [ Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ] . However , in the same study , when the membrane fraction was included in the immunoprecipitation , using detergent for lysis as we do here , these authors found the Wave complex to be weakly but signiﬁcantly active , in The Wave Complex is Intrinsically Inactive 11 contrast with ours . Immunoprecipitation or afﬁnity chro - matography relies strongly on the precise conditions used in terms of speed or buffer compositions , for the presence of associated factors or posttranslational modi - ﬁcations , as evidenced in this study by the presence of actin asssociated with the Wave complex puriﬁed through the PC procedure , but not through the FLAG procedure . Actin might be retrieved in the PC procedure through the WH2 domain of Wave proteins as well as through proﬁlin . The small protein proﬁlin may be at the detection limit of Coomassie in our pattern of puriﬁed Wave complex , but may still contribute a large amount of actin through its recruitment by the proline rich regions of Abi and Wave proteins . If the WH2 of Wave proteins contributes this actin , then it implies that the WH2 is exposed at the same time as the nearby acidic domain of the WCA is masked in the native complex . As far as activation is concerned , one can imagine that an activating factor or modiﬁcation was preserved in the conditions of Suetsugu et al . and lost in our puriﬁcation protocol , which was designed to assay the basal activity of Wave complexes . To assay endogenously activated Wave complexes , one should probably optimize the con - ditions required to preserve the speciﬁc membrane bind - ing partners of Wave1 and Wave2 such as WRP and IRSp53 , respectively [ Miki et al . , 2000 ; Soderling et al . , 2002 ] . These proteins belong to the superfamily of BAR / EFC / IMD containing proteins like several important regulators of the WASP family NPFs [ Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ] . Our results indicate that the native Wave complex is inactive . In consequence , this is the state to reach in reconstitution experiments . Only one publication assayed a reconstituted Wave complex obtained after the addition of subunits puriﬁed from different expression systems [ Innocenti et al . , 2004 ] . This reconstituted Wave2 com - plex was active , indicating that even though subunits were binding to each other , they did not reach their native conformation . A protocol enabling to reconstitute faithfully a Wave complex thus remains to be designed and may not be straightforward to reach . Indeed , cells assemble the Wave complex using original reactions constituting an assembly pathway that also remains to decipher . We recently provided evidence that the free form of Brk1 , a trimer , was used as a precursor in Wave complex assembly , even though a single molecule of Brk1 is complexed to Wave [ Derivery et al . , 2008 ] . This implies that along the assembly pathway , the trimeric precursor of Brk1 has to dissociate to incorporate into the nascent Wave complex . Structural studies require a large amount of homo - geneous material . So far only the global architecture of the Wave complex , i . e . the relationships among the ﬁve subunits , is known [ Gautreau et al . , 2004 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ] . Our fast protocol provides an unprece - dented amount of Wave complex , several hundreds of microgram . The expression of paralogous subunits in the same cell line creates a combination of Wave complexes . Our system , where one subunit is tagged and speciﬁcally retrieved from a cell lysate , enables to simplify this combinatorial complexity . In particular , tagging the Abi subunit , which has several splice variants in addition to three paralogues , enables to homogenize this most variable subunit . Nonetheless , we detected the two paralogues CyFIP1 and CyFIP2 and the two paralogues Wave1 and Wave2 in our preparation , indicating that there is possibly a mixture of four different Wave com - plexes . Cristallography , which requires milligram amount of a single molecular species , still appears as a long - term goal with this kind of puriﬁed Wave complex . However , 3D reconstruction at medium resolution from transmission electron microscopy of puriﬁed Wave com - plex seems within reach in terms of amount and homoge - neity given that the mixed Wave complexes are very likely to have the same overall structure . Moreover , we demonstrated here that one can purify Wave complexes tagged on any subunit . Using an additional GFP after the epitope tag , one can envision to locate each subunit ex - tremity by the extra - density in the 3D reconstruction obtained by transmission electron microscopy , as recently achieved in the case of the Arp2 / 3 complex puriﬁed from yeast [ Egile et al . , 2005 ] . The molecular replacement of the endogenous sub - units by the tagged subunit in these stable cell lines sim - pliﬁes the repertoire of subunits . This effect , which per - mitted that an overexpressed single Abi1 splice variant takes over the different endogenous Abi1 and Abi2 var - iants , is likely due to the instability of subunits when they do not reach their ﬁnal stable conformation , i . e . within a native Wave complex . That would explain why all subunits were only found in the Wave complex , when the distribution of endogenous subunits was analyzed in a sucrose gradient [ Gautreau et al . , 2004 ] . Brk1 was the only exception to this rule . The observation made in a wide variety of organisms that , upon depletion of one subunit by genetic inactivation or RNAi , the others are also depleted [ Blagg et al . , 2003 ; Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ; Le et al . , 2006 ; Derivery et al . , 2008 ] supports this idea that to be stable , subunits have to complete the assembly process and become part of the native Wave complex containing all its subunits . This property of molecular replacement of the en - dogenous subunits in stable cell lines overexpressing one subunit opens up an easy way to manipulate the reper - toire of expressed Wave complexes . One could imagine to reveal speciﬁc phenotypes associated with one partic - ular Wave complex and to understand the speciﬁc regu - 12 Derivery et al . lation of the Wave complex contributed by a particular subunit . Another potential use of this property is to immunodeplete the Wave complex from a cell - free extract using commercially available antibodies target - ing the epitope tag in order to study Wave complex func - tion in biomimetic systems . CONCLUSIONS The development of a fast puriﬁcation protocol for the Wave complex enabled us to purify a large amount of native Wave complex . This material provided an unambiguous answer to the question of its intrinsic activ - ity . We found that the Wave complex is inactive in its basal state . With this ground established , the questions of the factors activating the Wave complex and of the active state of the Wave complex can now be addressed in a simple frame . Moreover , the strategy and protocol we have developped here should be applicable for the puriﬁcation of other human multiprotein complexes .

NOTE ADDED IN PROOF Before the development of this fast technique to purify the Wave complex , AG previously examined the behaviors of native Wave1 or Wave2 complexes puriﬁed by several steps of classical chromatography . These were similar to the one reported here with the tagged complex , which contains a mixture of Wave1 and Wave2 . These complexes were intrinsically inactive . They were not activated by GTP bound Rac1 , nor by the ﬁrst SH3 domain of Nck . REFERENCES Blagg SL , Stewart M , Sambles C , Insall RH . 2003 .
