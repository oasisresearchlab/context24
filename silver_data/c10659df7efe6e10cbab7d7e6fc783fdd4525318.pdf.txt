Conclusion Swiprosin - 1 is required for ARVC to adapt to culture conditions . Additionally , it seems to be involved in the desensitization of β - adrenergic receptors . Assuming that ARVC adapt to car - diac stress in a similar way , swiprosin - 1 may play a key role in cardiac remodeling . Introduction Neonatal cardiomyocytes have the ability to perform mitosis , however this capability vanishes within the first week post - partum . Terminally differentiated adult cardiomyocytes have lost the ability to proliferate [ 1 ] . However , cardiomyocytes are able to adapt to cardiac stress like hypertension , cell loss and aging . Recent findings suggest that adaptation is a complex process of cellular dedifferentiation and redifferentiation [ 2 – 6 ] . Adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes ( ARVC ) in culture perform severe structural changes including sarcomere disassembly and reformation [ 7 ] . This is accompanied by a reexpression of fetal - type genes like β - myosin heavy chain ( β - MHC ) and α - smooth muscle actin ( α - sm - actin ) [ 8 , 9 ] . In culture ARVC form new sarcomeres alongside actin - driven stress fibers . This is preceded by the formation of pseudo - podia - like structures , a process known as cell spreading . As a result , ARVC in culture trans - form into widespread , polymorphic cells [ 9 ] . The trigger that induces spreading is still unknown . We hypothesize that swiprosin - 1 , an actin - binding protein , plays a key role in this process . In a dimeric form Swiprosin - 1 , also known as EF - Hand Domain Family Member D2 ( EFhd2 ) , stabilizes F - actin filaments by blocking the binding site of cofilin . Cofilin is needed for the depolymerization of F - actin [ 10 ] . To date , swiprosin - 1 has been only described in immune cells and in non - lymphatic brain tissue [ 10 – 12 ] . In immune cells it triggers the for - mation of lamellopodia which enable macrophages to migrate [ 10 – 12 ] . With the present study , we hypothesize that swiprosin - 1 is required for the formation of pseudopodia - like struc - tures ( spreading ) in ARVC . The heart responds to pathological stress like hypertension or ischemia by hypertrophy , which eventually leads to maladaptive cardiac remodeling and finally heart failure . Some of these maladaptive processes are calcium - calcineurin - dependent [ 13 – 16 ] . However , not all changes linked to maladaptation may be explained by calcineurin activation , even though high diastolic calcium levels seem to be a trigger [ 13 , 15 ] . Notably , calcium is also required for swi - prosin - 1 activation by being involved in the formation of swiprosin - 1 dimers which block the binding of cofilin [ 10 , 11 ] . Therefore , it may hamper cofilin activity . Activation of swiprosin - 1 by calcium and its ability to stabilize actin stress fibers encouraged us to analyze whether ARVC express swiprosin - 1 , and whether swiprosin - 1 is required for the formation of pseudo - podia - like structures in these cells . The latter are necessary for the subsequent rearrangement of sarcomeres . Accordingly , we re - established the above described model of cultivation of ARVC . As a control molecule that has already been identified to be required in the process of spreading , oncostatin M was investigated [ 4 ] . Additionally , former studies have shown a reduction of β - adrenoceptor responsiveness under the same culture conditions that induce spreading of cardiomyocytes [ 17 – 19 ] . Therefore , we correlated swiprosin - 1 expression with genes known to interfere with β - adrenoceptor - coupling . Taken together , our study was done on the basis of recent discoveries that cardiac de - and redifferentiation as it occurs under culture conditions mimics features seen in vivo during car - diac remodeling [ 2 , 4 ] . We want to identify if swiprosin - 1 plays a key role in the process of de - and redifferentiation and by that may be involved in the process of cardiac remodeling .

Materials , Animals and Protocols The investigation was conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institute of Health ( NIH Publication No . 85 – 23 , revised 1996 ) . The protocol was approved by the Justus Liebig University Giessen ( permission num - ber : 507 _ M ) . Sacrifice was performed under isoflurane anesthesia , all efforts were made to minimize suffering of the animals . Isolation and cultivation of adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes Ventricular cardiomyocytes of four month old male Wistar rats were isolated as described pre - viously [ 20 ] . Briefly , the rat was sacrificed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia with isoflurane . The heart was immediately transferred into ice - cold saline solution . It was fixated on the cannula of a Langendorff perfusion system , followed by a 25 minute perfusion with Powell medium ( 80ml ) containing collagenase ( 25mg ) and CaCl 2 ( 25μM ) at 37˚C . Subse - quently , ventricular tissue was minced and incubated in 5ml of the re - circulated buffer for five minutes . The remaining cell solution was filtered through a nylon mesh ( 200 μ m ) . After centri - fugation and stepwise addition of CaCl 2 ( 200μM , 400μM and 1000μM ) cells were plated on petry dishes , coated with 4 % ( vol / vol ) fetal calf serum ( FCS ) . After one hour , the medium ( medium 199 ) supplemented with carnitine ( 2mM ) , creatin ( 5mM ) , taurine ( 5mM ) , penicil - lin - streptomycin ( 2 % ) and 20 % FCS was refreshed . Cytosine - β - arabinofuranoside ( 10mM ) was supplemented to hamper the proliferation of any contaminating cells . The incubator was held at 37˚C . Small interfering RNA ( siRNA ; FlexiTube siRNA Swiprosin , QIAGEN , Netherlands ) at a concentration of 0 . 05μM was used to decease the expression of swiprosin - 1 . Scrambled siRNA ( “scRNA” , All Stars Negative Control siRNA , QIAGEN , Netherlands ) served as negative con - trol and was applied in the same concentration . This RNA interference took place once after washing the freshly plated ARVC . Intracellular calcium was diminished by Bapta - AM ( Molecular Probes 1 invitrogen dectec - tion technologies , USA ) . It was dissolved in DMSO ( 5μg / ml ; Roth , Germany ) and added to the plates in a concentration of 10μg / ml after the last washing step . Pure DMSO in a concentration of 5μg / ml was used as a control . With each cell preparation 150 to 300 cardiomyocytes were evaluated per day and group by light microscopy . All counted cardiomyocytes were subdivided into four groups according to their appearance : “rod - shaped” , “round down” , “spreading” and “unusual appearance” ( S1 Fig ) . The category “spreading” included all cardiomyocytes with pseudopodia - like structures . “Unusual appearance” included all ARVC with an irregular surface and no detectable intact cell membrane . After five days in culture ARVC showed no expression of fibroblast markers ( collagen - 3 ) , but of cardiac specific markers like ANP compared to isolated cardiac fibroblast after 24 hours in culture , which showed vice - versa results . Both , cardiac fibroblasts and ARVC expressed swi - prosin - 1 ( Efhd2 ) on mRNA level ( S2 Fig ) . Immunofluorescence staining of cardiomyocytes In order to analyze the morphological and structural conversion of cardiomyocytes in culture confocal laser scan microscopy was performed . Phalloidin TRITC ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Germany ) was used to stain F - actin according to the manufacturers protocol . The day of cell isolation , labeled as day zero , was used as control . Briefly , cells were fixated with paraformalde - hyde ( 4 % ) . After permeabilization with TritonX - 100 ( 0 . 2 % ) cardiomyocytes were incubated Effects of Swiprosin - 1 in Adult Cardiomyocytes PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0167655 December16 , 2016 3 / 15 with Phalloidin - TRITC ( 10μMol ) . F - actin filaments appeared red in immunofluorescence microscopy . Immunoblot technique Isolated ARVC were incubated with lysis buffer as described previously [ 21 ] . SDS page gel electrophoresis was conducted with the system of NuPAGE , Novex 1 ( Life Technologies , USA ) . The expression of swiprosin - 1 was detected by using a swiprosin - 1 antibody produced in goat ( Biorbyt Ltd . , USA ) . A GRK - 2 antibody produced in rabbit ( Sigma - Aldrich , Germany ) was used to investigate GRK - 2 expression in ARVC . All measurements were normalized to the expression of GAPDH using an antibody produced in mice ( Calbiochem 1 , Germany ) . Pro - tein expression was quantified with horseradish peroxidase and a chemiluminescence machine from Peqlab . RT - PCR Real - time quantitative RT - PCR in ARVC was performed as described before [ 22 ] . Total RNA was isolated using peqGOLD TriFast ( Peqlab , Biotechnologie GmbH , Germany ) according to the manufacturer‘s protocol . After conversion of RNA into complementary DNA ( cDNA ) with reverse transcriptase , PCR was performed with iQ™SYBR 1 Green Supermix ( BIO Rad , Germany ) . In order to detect unspecific binding melting curve analysis or DNA gels were per - formed . For experiments with quantitative real time RT - PCR , ARVC of four petri dishes ( 2ml ) were combined in one sample . Each group contained twelve to fourteen samples . For correla - tion analyses all samples were analyzed . The primers used are listed in supplementary materi - als ( S1 Table ) . Load free cell shortening Determination of ARVC contraction was performed as described before [ 23 , 24 ] . ARVC were stimulated with two AgCl electrodes at 2Hz . Four measurements per cell were conducted and the mean of these measurements was used to define cell shortening . Isoprenaline ( SERVA Feinbiochemica , Germany ) , a β - adrenoceptor agonist , was added five minutes before measure - ment in a concentration of 10μM . Additionally , ARVC were incubated for 24 hours with scRNA or siRNA directed against swiprosin - 1 in a medium without FCS . All experiments were normalized to the control group of ARVC without any treatment . Statistics Statistical analysis was performed using two - way ANOVA followed by Student - Newman - Keuls post hoc analysis or one - side ANOVA with Tukey test . If required , Student´s T - Test was performed with Levene Test to test for normal distribution of samples within a group . Man - Whitney - U post hoc analysis was conducted for samples without normal distribution . For the statistical calculation of all data SPSS 22 . 0 was used . A value of p < 0 . 05 was considered to be significant . Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) or mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) , indicated in the legend to the figures . Results Adult cardiomyocytes in culture Changes in the shape of ARVC adapting to the culture conditions were investigated daily over a time period of six days . Freshly isolated ARVC were typically rod shaped with a clearly visible cross striation ( Fig 1A Day 0 ) . Changes in cell morphology were observed during the following Effects of Swiprosin - 1 in Adult Cardiomyocytes PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0167655 December16 , 2016 4 / 15 days in culture . First ARVC lost all their contractile elements beginning in the periphery ( Fig 1A Day 1 and Day 2 ) . This was followed by a reformation , implicating de novo sarcomerogen - esis . This reformation was preceded by the typical formation of pseudopodia - like structures ( spreading , Fig 1A Day 3 – Day 6 ) . De novo sarcomerogenesis started with the appearance of actin stress fibers ( Fig 1A Day 3 ) . Actin bundles initially appeared in the perinuclear region and formed newly assembled sarcomeres ( Fig 1A Day 4 and Day 5 ) . Latter grew along the preformed actin stress fibers into the periphery ( Fig 1A Day 6 ) . At the end of the cultivation Fig 1 .

They lost all their contractileelements ( Day 2 ) followedby formation of pseudopodia - likestructures ( spreading ; Day 3 – 5 ) and subsequent reformationof their contractileelements indicating de novo sarcomerogenesis ( Day 6 ) . At day six in culture , cross striation was clearly detectable again .

Fig 1B displays the kinetic of the spreading process during cultivation . The frac - tion of ARVC showing pseudopodia - like structures at each time of examination are given as spreading in % ( Fig 1B ) . Spreading started around day three and increased constantly during cultivation time , until 14 . 7 % ± 1 . 39 % ARVC showed pseudopodia - like structures at day six . This process was accompanied by reexpression of β - MHC , whereas the expression of α - MHC decreased during cultivation time ( Fig 2A ) . Furthermore , oncostatin M was significantly increased , when the formation of pseudopodia - like structures started at day three ( Fig 2B ) . Expression of swiprosin - 1 during cultivation To our knowledge we are the first to provide evidence that swiprosin - 1 is expressed in ARVC . Changes in the expression of swiprosin - 1 in ARVC during cultivation are shown in Fig 3A and 3B . Swiprosin - 1 mRNA levels increased during cultivation ( day 1 : 0 . 51 - fold ± 0 . 13 ; day 3 : 2 . 99 - fold ± 0 . 55 ; day 5 : 2 . 85 - fold ± 0 . 72 compared to day 0 ) ( Fig 3A ) . Protein expression of swi - prosin - 1 decreased throughout the first three days ( data not shown ) followed by a significant Fig 2 .

Typically , mRNA expression of swiprosin - 1 increased before protein expression . Thus , cell spreading is associated with increased swiprosin - 1 expression during cultivation . Swiprosin - 1 is needed for de novo sarcomerogenesis in cultured ARVC In order to investigate the role of swiprosin - 1 in the spreading process more closely , experi - ments with siRNA directed against swiprosin - 1 were performed . Immunoblot analysis con - firmed a significant reduction to 74 . 77 % ± 11 . 88 % of swiprosin - 1 at protein level with siRNA directed against swiprosin - 1 compared to scramble RNA ( scRNA ) ( Fig 4A ) . Addition of siRNA directed against swiprosin - 1 delayed spreading of ARVC . At day six , siRNA against swiprosin - 1 reduced spreading by 55 . 61 % ± 14 . 34 % compared to ARVC treated with scRNA ( Fig 4B ) . Additionally , fewer cells performed spreading in the presence of siRNA against swi - prosin - 1 at day four ( p = 0 . 052 ) and day five ( p = 0 . 059 ) . Although the number of ARVC Fig 3 .

First they completely lost their contractile apparatus followed by a reformation of actin - stress fibers and de novo sarcomerogenesis ( S3 Fig ) . Effect of intracellular calcium modulation on cell spreading Calcium is required to activate swiprosin - 1 [ 10 , 11 ] . We hypothesize that an alteration in the intracellular calcium levels may influence the ability of adult cardiomyocytes to spread . Bapta - Fig 4 . Blocking the translation of swiprosin - 1 with siRNA and decreasingthe intracellular calcium with Bapta - AM attenuated spreading in ARVC . ( A ) siRNA againstswiprosin - 1 ( 0 . 05 μ M ) caused a down regulationin protein expressionfor swiprosin - 1 comparedto scRNA at day 2 in culture . Additionally , Bapta - AM ( 10 μ g / ml ) decreased the expressionof swiprosin - 1 on protein level , too . ( B ) Through the wholecultivation a constant down regulationof spreading in ARVC treated with siRNA againstswiprosin - 1was detectable . ( C ) Bapta - AM led to a constant decreasein spreading , too . Data are presented as means ± SEM ; n = 3 – 4 cell preparations ( n = 800 – 1000cells ) ; * P (cid:20) 0 . 05 ; unpairedT - Test or Man - Whitney - U - Test , Ctr = control group , Bapta = ARVC treated with Bapta - AM doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0167655 . g004 Effects of Swiprosin - 1 in Adult Cardiomyocytes PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0167655 December16 , 2016 8 / 15 AM , a known cell - permeable calcium chelator , caused a constant decrease in spreading of ARVC compared to the control group . At day six , Bapta - AM decreased spreading by 62 . 42 % ± 24 . 10 % compared to control ( Fig 4C ) . On protein level a significant down regulation ( 49 . 89 % ± 9 . 87 % ) of swiprosin - 1 was found in Bapta - AM treated cardiomyocytes compared to control ( Fig 4A ) . Swiprosin - 1 expression correlates with GRK2 expression and causes β - adrenoceptor desensitization Experiments with ARVC in culture showed a change in the responsiveness of β 1 - and β 2 - adre - noceptors [ 17 – 19 ] . As swiprosin - 1 significantly affected the adaptation to culture conditions during which also changes in β - adrenoceptor coupling were observed , we correlated the expres - sion of swiprosin - 1 in vitro with genes known to interfere with β - adrenoceptors . The following four proteins showed a distinct positive correlation with the expression of swiprosin - 1 : G pro - tein - coupled receptor kinase 2 and 5 ( GRK2 and GRK5 ) , β 1 - arrestin and β 2 - arrestin ( Fig 5 ) . All of these proteins are proved to be involved in the desensitization of β - adrenoceptors . Addition - ally , a positive correlation between the expression of swiprosin - 1 and β 1 - and β 2 - adrenoceptors was detected . The highest correlation with swiprosin - 1 was found for GRK2 ( R 2 = 0 . 830 ) . Hence , swiprosin - 1 may cause β - adrenoceptor desensitization via co - regulation of GRK2 . To Fig 5 .

Western Blots showed a decrease in protein level of GRK2 in ARVC treated with siRNA against swiprosin - 1 compared to ARVC treated with scRNA ( Fig 6A ) . Load free cell shortening ( 2Hz ) showed no difference in basal contractile responsiveness between ARVC treated with scRNA , siRNA or vehicle ( Fig 6B ) . However , controls increased their contractile amplitude as a response to β - adrenergic stimulation with isoprenaline . Interestingly , this con - tractile responsiveness was further increased in ARVCs treated with siRNA directed against swi - prosin - 1 ( Fig 6B ) . The same effect could be detected with siRNA against GRK2 ( Rolf Schreckenberg , personal communication ) . Summarized , the data suggest a functional relevant GRK2 down regulation in swiprosin - 1 depleted ARVC . Discussion This study reports three new findings . First , ARVC constitutively express swiprosin - 1 as shown here in ARVC on mRNA and protein level . Second , swiprosin - 1 is required to initiate the formation of pseudopodia - like structures ( spreading ) , a process necessary to adapt to cul - ture conditions . Third , the expression level of swiprosin - 1 is associated to that of GRK2 and thereby to β - adrenoceptor responsiveness . In the present study we successfully re - established the cultivation model of adult cardiomyo - cytes , which was described in the 1980s [ 8 , 9 , 25 – 27 ] . ARVC performed a severe remodeling dur - ing cultivation . First the cells lost their contractile elements accompanied by a transition from a rod - shaped morphology to a round form . Subsequently , ARVC formed pseudopodia - like struc - tures ( spreading ) and finally emerged as polymorphic cells with an intracellular net of actin stress - fibers . Along these stress fibers new sarcomeres were formed . After six days in culture , the typical cross striation of sarcomeres reappeared in ARVC . This change was accompanied by replacing α - MHC by β - MHC . As expected , expression of oncostatin M , known to trigger the process of de - and redifferentiation was increased during cultivation [ 4 ] . Thus , within six days the process of de - and redifferentiation of ARVC , which is a well - known phenomenon , could be observed in our study . In this process ARVC showed a mixture between the fetal and embry - onic cell - like cell type , but remained highly differentiated [ 25 ] . For example , they formed new sarcomeres alongside actin stress fibers like adult terminal differentiated cardiomyocytes do , whereas fetal cardiomyocytes start sarcomerogenesis at the sarcolemma [ 28 ] . The process of de - and redifferentiation enables ARVC to adapt to new environments and circumstances [ 2 – 6 ] . We showed with this study , swiprosin - 1 is constitutively expressed in ARVC on mRNA and protein level . By hampering the translation of swiprosin - 1 with siRNA , a significant reduc - tion in spreading was detected in ARVC . Consequently , swiprosin - 1 seems to be required for the adaptation of ARVC to culture conditions . According to the manufacturers’ protocol , the intracellular level of siRNA is sufficient to maintain the gene silencing effect for five to six days . Although , this cannot be certain for the last days in culture an effect of siRNA directed against swiprosin - 1 was detected on protein level in the first days of cultivation . The main effect of siRNA directed against swiprosin - 1 is a delay in the induction of the spreading pro - cess . The ARVC treated with siRNA which showed spreading , performed a similar process of dedifferentiation and redifferentiation as seen in control conditions . According to the treat - ment protocol it is possible , that either not all the swiprosin - 1 in the cardiomyocytes was blocked or that not all cardiomyocytes absorbed the small interfering RNA . Because we could only detect a 25 % decrease of swiprosin - 1 on protein level and no transfection medium was used to protect the sensitive cardiomyocytes , we suspect that ARVC exhibiting the typical spreading behavior as seen under control conditions did not absorb the siRNA against Effects of Swiprosin - 1 in Adult Cardiomyocytes PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0167655 December16 , 2016 10 / 15 swiprosin - 1 . Former researchers established that swiprosin - 1 is required for the formation of lamellopodia in macrophages and by that for the formation of contractile elements enabling immune cells to migrate [ 10 – 12 ] . Taking our present results into consideration we proved that Fig 6 . Swiprosin - 1 caused β - adrenoceptor desensitization by interaction with GRK2 . ( A ) GRK2 protein level was reducedin ARVC treated with siRNA againstswiprosin - 1 ( 0 . 05 μ M ) comparedto scRNA at day 1 in culture . ( B ) In cell shorteningof ARVC after 24h in culture betweencontrol , scRNA and siRNA for swiprosin - 1 no difference was detectable . Addingisoprenaline ( ISO ; 10 μ M ) to control ARVC and ARVC treated with scRNA led to an increasein cell shortening ability . This effect was increasedin ARVC treated with siRNA , thus down regulation of swiprosin - 1 led to down regulation of GRK2 and therefore to an increased responsiveness to the β - adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline .

Therefore , swiprosin - 1 may be a key player in redifferentiation of adult cardiomyocytes . Next , we investigated the role of calcium in swiprosin - 1 dependent spreading . We decreased the intracellular calcium concentration using Bapta - AM . Bapta - AM is a well - known and often used cell - permanent calcium chelator [ 29 ] . Binding of free intracellular Ca 2 + by Bapta - AM led to a decrease of pseudopodia - like structures in ARVC compared to the control group . Furthermore , western blot analysis revealed a reduction of swiprosin - 1 on protein level in Bapta - AM treated ARVC . Hence , calcium seems to be required for swiprosin - 1 expression and activity . Finally , we found a strong correlation between swiprosin - 1 expression and proteins , partici - pating in β - adrenoceptor desensitization . Swiprosin - 1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of GRK5 , β 1 - arrestin , β 2 - arrestin , and especially GRK2 . This relationship between swiprosin - 1 and GRK2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis . Its functional rele - vance was implicated by load free cell shortening . This consequently leads to the assumption that an up - regulation of swiprosin - 1 , e . g . during cardiac stress , causes a decrease in ARVC responsiveness to β - adrenergic stimulation . β - adrenoceptor desensitization is a characteristic feature of heart failure . Here it is associated with cardiac remodeling and leads to an impaired cardiac function with a depression of heart rate and cardiac output [ 30 ] . However , the desensi - tization of β - adrenoceptors in an acute cardiac insult may have a protective effect [ 31 ] . Patients suffering from a myocardial infarction normally receive β - blockers [ 32 – 34 ] . Thus it is expedi - ent for swiprosin - 1 , which seems to play a major role in the adaptation and regeneration pro - cess of ARVC via dedifferentiation and redifferentiation , to be coupled to GRK2 expression , which leads to β - adrenoceptor desensitization . This may protect dedifferentiating cardiomyo - cytes during the adaptation to stress . Additionally , we detected a positive correlation of swiprosin - 1 with β 1 - and β 2 - adrenocep - tors , although the effect was stronger for β 1 . Former studies revealed a shift from β 1 - to β 2 - adrenoceptors during cultivation , which caused an increased hypertrophic responsiveness [ 17 , 18 ] . The role of swiprosin - 1 in chronic heart injuries was not part of the experiments shown here and needs to be investigated in the future . However , previous experiments have shown that chronic dedifferentiation in stressed adult cardiomyocytes leads to impaired cardiac func - tion and survival rates . But , in acute states it had positive effects [ 4 , 6 ] . Therefore , we hypothe - size that swiprosin - 1 and the dedifferentiation process are needed for acute regeneration of adult cardiomyocytes under stress situations . Future investigations will have to focus on the relevance of cardiac swiprosin - 1 expression in vivo . Supporting Information S1 Fig . Categorization of ARVC by light microscopy . Day 0 : Freshly isolated cardiomyocytes are „rod - shaped“ . Day 2 : In the first days of culture ARVC „round down” ( 1 and 2 ) . Cardio - myocytes with „unusual appearance” ( 3 ) showed an irregular surface . Day 6 : Cardiomyocytes with a round cell body and pseudopodia - like structures ( 1 ) as well as widespread cardiomyo - cytes ( 2 ) were counted as „spreading“ . „Unusual appearence”is shown in this picture as ( 3 ) . Pseudopodia - like structures are shown exemplary . ( TIFF ) S2 Fig . DNA gel of qRT - PCR in ARVC . DNA gels showed a mRNA expression of the cardiac specific ANP in ARVC cultivated for five days , whereas an expression of the fibroblast marker collagen 3 could not be detected . Isolated cardiac fibroblasts ( FB ) served as control .
