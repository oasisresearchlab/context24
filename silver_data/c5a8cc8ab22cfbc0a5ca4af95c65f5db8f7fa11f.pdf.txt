Goode , Avital A . Rodal , Georjana Barnes , and David G . Drubin Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California Berkeley , Berkeley , California 94720 - 3202 Abstract . The actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex plays a central role in assembly of actin networks . Be - cause distinct actin - based structures mediate diverse processes , many proteins are likely to make spatially and temporally regulated interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex . We have isolated a new activator , Abp1p , which associates tightly with the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex . Abp1p contains two acidic sequences ( DDW ) similar to those found in SCAR / WASp proteins . We demonstrate that mutation of these sequences abolishes Arp2 / 3 com - plex activation in vitro . Genetic studies indicate that this activity is important for Abp1p functions in vivo . In contrast to SCAR / WASp proteins , Abp1p binds speciﬁ - cally to actin ﬁlaments , not monomers . Actin ﬁlament binding is mediated by the ADF / coﬁlin homology ( ADF - H ) domain of Abp1p and is required for Arp2 / 3 complex activation in vitro . We demonstrate that Abp1p recruits Arp2 / 3 complex to the sides of ﬁlaments , sug - gesting a novel mechanism of activation . Studies in yeast and mammalian cells indicate that Abp1p is in - volved functionally in endocytosis . Based on these re - sults , we speculate that Abp1p may link Arp2 / 3 - medi - ated actin assembly to a speciﬁc step in endocytosis . Key words : actin • yeast • Arp2 / 3 complex • Abp1 • endocytosis Introduction Rapid actin assembly and turnover are required for diverse cellular processes including endocytosis , cell motility , and morphogenesis . For this reason , there has been strong in - terest in learning how actin assembly is regulated in cells . Recently , the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 1 2 / 3 complex has emerged as a central regulator of actin dynamics and orga - nization ( reviewed in Machesky and Gould , 1999 ) . This protein complex has a mass of z 200 kD and is composed of seven highly conserved subunits : p40 , p35 , p21 , p19 , p15 , and the actin related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 . So far , two activities have been identified for purified Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro : nucleation of actin filament assembly and actin fil - ament branching ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Welch et al . , 1998 ) . Alone , the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates actin assembly weakly . However , in the presence of activating proteins , ac - tin nucleation increases dramatically . To date , three activa - tors of the Arp2 / 3 complex have been identified . They are the Listeria ActA protein ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) , the ubiqui - tous cellular SCAR / WASp proteins ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Winter et al . , 1999 ; Yarar et al . , 1999 ) , and fission yeast type I myosin ( Lee et al . , 2000 ) . For each , the minimal domain requirements for activation in vitro have been defined . SCAR / WASp activation requires an acidic motif and an adjacent actin monomer binding do - main ( reviewed in Higgs and Pollard , 1999 ; Mullins , 2000 ) . Activation by ActA requires three regions : an acidic se - quence , an adjacent actin monomer binding domain , and an additional sequence with weak similarity to cofilin ( Skoble et al . , 2000 ) . The acidic motif associates directly with the Arp2 / 3 complex and , in current models , the actin monomer binding domain is thought to present an actin subunit to Arp2 and / or Arp3 , promoting the formation of a filament seed for rapid polymerization ( see , for example , Skoble et al . , 2000 ) . Although fission yeast myosin I activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , its mechanism of activation is less well un - derstood ( Lee et al . , 2000 ) . Budding yeast myosin I also Drs .

However , it has not yet been shown to activate Arp2 / 3 - nucleated actin assembly in vitro . Here , we identify a new activator of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , the actin binding protein Abp1p . We demonstrate that actin monomer binding activity is not a strict require - ment for Arp2 / 3 complex activation , since Abp1p lacks this property . Instead , our data support an alternative model for activation in which Abp1p recruits the Arp2 / 3 complex to the sides of actin filaments to promote fila - ment nucleation . Abp1p was the first actin - associated protein identified in yeast ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . Since then , it has been shown that Abp1p and drebrins are homologous and form a family of proteins conserved from yeast to humans ( Lap - palainen et al . , 1998 ) . These proteins contain multiple do - mains with different functions : an ADF / cofilin homology domain ( ADF - H ) , a helical region , a proline - rich domain , and an SH3 domain . In yeast , Abp1p localizes to cortical actin patches , and its overexpression causes severe defects in cellular actin organization ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . An abp1 null mutant is viable , but is synthetically lethal in combination with mutations in genes encoding other actin - associated proteins : sac6 , sla1 , and sla2 ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . In mammalian cells , Abp1p localizes to the perinu - clear region , but upon activation of the GTPase Rac , Abp1p translocates to the leading edge of cells in a pattern that overlaps precisely with Arp2 / 3 complex localization ( Kessels et al . , 2000 ) . A variety of studies in yeast and mammalian cells have linked Abp1p to endocytosis functionally ( mammalian studies reviewed in Qualmann et al . , 2000 ) . In yeast , Abp1p and the coiled coil region of Sla2p perform a re - dundant function required for endocytosis ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . ABP1 is also required for proper localization in cells of the endocytosis - regulating kinases Ark1p and Prk1p ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) . The proline - rich region of Abp1p binds directly to the SH3 domain of Rvs167p / am - phiphysin , another factor required for endocytosis ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . However , until now , Abp1p was thought to function simply as a physical bridge between actin filaments and endocytic machinery . Our data suggest that Abp1p provides an active link between Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization and an en - docytic function . Materials and Methods Purification of Yeast Arp2 / 3 Complex and Abp1p Using HEK buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl ) supplemented with 10 % glycerol and with 1 mM PMSF plus an aqueous cocktail of protease inhibitors , a high - speed supernatant was generated from lysed yeast cells ( DDY1519 ) , as described previously ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . Actin assembly stimulated by addition of 5 mM MgCl 2 was carried out for 1 h on ice . To isolate assembled actin , the reactions were centri - fuged at 4 8 C for 1 h in an SA600 rotor ( Sorvall ) at 17 , 000 rpm . Pellets were washed once in 6 ml HEKGM buffer ( HEK supplemented with 10 % glyc - erol and 5 mM MgCl 2 ) , and repelleted by centrifugation ( 80 , 000 rpm ) for 20 min at 4 8 C in a TLA100 . 3 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) . The actin pellet was rinsed once in HEKGM buffer , and actin - associated proteins ( AAPs ) were isolated by resuspending the pellet in 3 ml HEKGM buffer 1 0 . 5 M KCl . This material was dounced 10 – 20 3 ( tight - fitting pestle ) on ice and centrifuged at 4 8 C for 20 min in a TLA100 . 3 rotor at 80 , 000 rpm . The su - pernatant contained the AAP mixture . The pellet contained actin , which was further purified on a MonoQ ( 5 / 5 ) column ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , followed by a Superdex 75 gel filtration column ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , and was stored in G buffer as described previously ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from AAP by two different strategies ( sig - nificance described in Results ) . In the two - step method , the salt concentra - tion of AAP was lowered by diluting sevenfold in HEKG 5 buffer ( HEK 1 5 % glycerol ) . The AAP was then fractionated by FPLC on a monoQ ( 5 / 5 ) column , eluting with a 25 - ml linear KCl gradient ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 6 M ) and collecting 0 . 5 – ml fractions . Arp2 / 3 - containing fractions were identified by the dis - tinct seven - band pattern on SDS - PAGE gels and by immunoblotting with anti – Arp2p antibodies ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) . Peak fractions were pooled , desalted in HEKG 5 , and concentrated to 0 . 3 ml using Microcon10 devices ( Amicon ) . Arp2 / 3 complex was then fractionated on a Superose 12 gel fil - tration column ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , equilibrated in HEKG 5 , collecting 0 . 5 - ml fractions . Arp2 / 3 complex eluted in a peak z 12 ml after loading , consistent with a mass of 220 – 250 kD . Peak Arp2 / 3 fractions were pooled , concentrated as above to 5 m M , and stored in aliquots at 2 80 8 C . In the one - step purification , the AAP was desalted and concentrated in a Microcon10 device , and then fractionated by gel filtration as above . By this method , Arp2 / 3 complex eluted from the column z 11 ml after load - ing . To quantitate the stoichiometry of the Abp1p – Arp2 / 3 complex associ - ation , Abp1p and Arc19p bands were quantified by densitometry and the stoichiometry was found to be an z 1 : 1 molar ratio . To purify native yeast Abp1p , the Abp1p - containing fractions from the mono Q column were identified by immunoblotting with anti – Abp1p anti - bodies ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . Peak fractions were pooled , concentrated , and fractionated by gel filtration chromatography as above . Abp1p eluted from the Superose 12 column z 14 ml after loading and was concentrated to 20 m M and stored as above . Abp1p - Arp2 / 3 Binding Assays Anti – HA . 11 monoclonal antibodies ( BAbCO ) were covalently attached to CL4B protein A beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) using Di - methyl pimelimidate ( DMP ; Pierce Chemical Co . ) . A high - speed superna - tant ( HSS ) was generated as above from yeast ( YMW15 ) expressing a func - tional 3 3 hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged Arp2p as the only source of Arp2p ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) . 1 . 5 ml of HSS / 10 m l antibody beads was mixed in a rotator at 4 8 C for 1 h . The beads were then washed five times in HEKG 5 , once in HEKG 5 1 0 . 4 M KCl , and once in HEKG 5 . Samples of the Arp2 / 3 - loaded beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer without reducing agent , and fractionated on SDS - PAGE gels that were subsequently stained with Coomassie blue . Beads contained 5 – 10 m M Arp2 / 3 complex . 1 m M Abp1p was added to 10 m l of Arp2 / 3 - loaded beads or control beads ( no Arp2 / 3 ) in a 100 - m l reaction in HEKG 5 ( final concentration Arp2 / 3 = 0 . 5 – 1 m M ) . Re - actions were mixed on a rotator for 20 min at 25 8 C . Beads were washed three times with 100 m l HEKG 5 and analyzed by SDS - PAGE as above . Actin Filament Cosedimentation For copelleting assays , 1 m M Abp1p was added to variable concentrations of assembled purified yeast actin ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) , incubated for 20 min at 25 8 C , and centrifuged for 30 min in a TLA100 rotor at 90 , 000 rpm . Pellets and supernatants were fractionated on 12 % SDS - PAGE gels that were subsequently stained with Coomassie blue . Band intensities were quantitated by densitometry . To measure the ability of Abp1p to recruit Arp2 / 3 complex to actin filaments , 0 . 5 m M Abp1p and 1 m M F - actin were mixed with variable concentrations of Arp2 / 3 complex ( 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 125 , and 250 nM ) . The reactions were incubated for 15 min at 25 8 C , and then centrifuged for 15 min at 90 , 000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor . Pellets and super - natants were fractionated on 12 % SDS - PAGE gels , blotted , and probed with Arp2 antibodies . Densitometry was performed to determine the level of cosedimentation of Arp2 / 3 complex with actin filaments . Actin Assembly Assays To measure actin assembly kinetics , light scattering and pyrene fluores - cence assays were performed as described previously ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . 60 m l of 3 - m M yeast actin ( or 2 . 5 - m M yeast actin 1 0 . 5 - m M pyrene - labeled yeast actin ) were mixed rapidly with 3 . 5 m l of initiation buffer and 6 . 5 m l HEKG 5 , Arp2 / 3 , and / or Abp1p , and then immediately transferred to a cu - on A p r il 20 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published April 30 , 2001 Goode et al . Arp2 / 3 Complex Activation by Abp1p 629 vette in a fluorometer . Polymer mass levels were determined by sedimen - tation 1 h after initiation of assembly ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . Purification and Analyses of Abp1p Mutants Abp1p mutants were generated by PCR in pEG ( KT ) ( Mitchell et al . , 1993 ) or in pDD187 ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) , and sequenced . GST fusion proteins were purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DDY1810 es - sentially as described ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . Mutants of pDD187 were tested for genetic interactions in DDY995 , DDY996 , and DDY997 as described previously ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . Results Identification of a New Arp2 / 3 Complex - associated Activator Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complex was purified by a new procedure we developed to study actin assembly in yeast extracts ( see Materials and Methods ) , a method that will be described in greater detail elsewhere ( Goode , B . L . , A . A . Rodal , G . Barnes , and D . G . Drubin , manuscript in preparation ) . In this procedure , actin assembly was stimu - lated in yeast lysates after clarification by ultracentrifuga - tion . The actin structures that formed in the extracts con - tained . 90 % of the cellular actin , . 80 % of the cellular Arp2 / 3 complex , and many other known yeast actin - asso - ciated proteins ( determined by quantitative immunoblot - ting ) . These actin structures were isolated by low - speed centrifugation , and the actin - associated proteins were stripped from the filaments with high salt ( 0 . 5 M KCl ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex is an abundant component of the salt - stripped AAP mixture and was purified away from the other proteins using two additional steps , ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography ( Fig . 1 , a and b ) . The isolated complex is composed of seven polypeptides of the expected molecular weights : 15 , 19 , 21 , 35 , 40 , 43 , and 53 kD ( Fig . 1 b , d ) . The complex includes the 40 - kD subunit that has been identified in preparations from other organ - isms , but was reported previously to not copurify with the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . We refer to this as the “core” Arp2 / 3 complex . Core Arp2 / 3 complex modestly accelerated actin assem - bly ( Fig . 2 , n ) . It was activated by a carboxyl - terminal fragment of Las17p / WASP ( see below ) , consistent with re - cent reports ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Winter et al . , 1999 ) , and by the ActA protein from Listeria monocytoge - nes ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) ( Fig . 2 , s ) . We next investigated the possibility that ion exchange chromatography had removed factors normally associated with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Therefore , we purified the Arp2 / 3 complex from AAP by a one - step approach using gel filtration chromatography . This revealed a doublet protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 85 kD that cofractionated with the Arp2 / 3 complex in a 0 . 94 : 1 molar ratio to other subunits in the complex ( Fig . 1 c , * ) . We refer to this material as “intact”Arp2 / 3 complex . In - tact Arp2 / 3 complex eluted earlier from the gel filtration column than the core Arp2 / 3 complex , consistent with an increase in mass from the associated factor . Comparison of the nucleation activities of the intact and core Arp2 / 3 preparations revealed a striking difference : intact Arp2 / 3 complex nucleated actin assembly with rapid kinetics ( Fig . 2 , d ) , similar to ActA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex . Abp1p Associates Directly with the Arp2 / 3 Complex and Activates Actin Assembly We identified by immunoblotting the associated doublet in the intact Arp2 / 3 complex as Abp1p ( Fig . 1 d ) , one of the first actin binding proteins found in yeast ( Drubin et Figure 1 .

This conclusion was confirmed by mass spectrome - try analysis ( B . L . Goode , data not shown ) . Immunoblot - ting showed that all of the Abp1p in the AAP comigrated with the Arp2 / 3 complex through gel filtration . To test whether Abp1p is the activating factor in the intact Arp2 / 3 complex , we purified GST - Abp1p from yeast ( see Materi - als and Methods ) . Addition of GST - Abp1p to the core Arp2 / 3 complex restored nucleation ( Fig . 2 , 3 ) to a level similar to that observed for intact Arp2 / 3 complex . At these concentrations ( h ) , or at higher concentrations ( not shown ) , Abp1p alone did not affect actin assembly signifi - cantly . We also purified native Abp1p from yeast by frac - tionating the AAP mixture using sequential ion - exchange and gel - filtration chromatography ( Fig . 3 A ) . This Abp1p activated nucleation by core Arp2 / 3 complex identically to recombinant GST - Abp1p ( not shown ) . Next , we characterized the biochemical properties of na - tive yeast Abp1p , which have not been reported previ - ously . Abp1p cosedimented with HA - tagged Arp2 / 3 com - plex immobilized on beads ( Fig . 3 B ) , demonstrating that its association with the Arp2 / 3 complex is direct . Abp1p associated directly and tightly with actin filaments ( K d , 0 . 1 m M ) , with binding saturating at a 1 : 1 molar stoichiome - try of Abp1p to filamentous actin ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . Abp1p also recruited the Arp2 / 3 complex to actin fila - ments in cosedimentation assays ( Fig . 3 E ) , suggesting that a tertiary complex may form between filamentous actin , Abp1p , and the Arp2 / 3 complex . The affinity of core yeast Arp2 / 3 complex for actin filaments was weak ( K d 5 2 m M ) , similar to Arp2 / 3 complex isolated from Acan - thamoeba ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . The addition of Abp1p in - creased the affinity by at least 30 - fold ( K d , 0 . 06 m M , data not shown ) . In contrast to SCAR / WASp proteins , purified Abp1p showed no affinity for actin monomers , as tested by native gel - shift assay and etheno - ATP exchange assay ( not shown ) , and did not change actin critical concentration or slow actin assembly ( not shown ) . The inability of yeast Abp1p to bind to actin monomers is consistent with the re - ported properties of mouse Abp1p ( Kessels et al . , 2000 ) . Abp1p Requires Its Two Acidic Motifs and ADF - H Domain for Arp2 / 3 Complex Activation In Vitro Abp1p has multiple domains : an NH 2 - terminal ADF - H domain , two acidic sequences with homology to those found in SCAR / WASp proteins , a proline - rich region , and an SH3 domain ( Fig . 4 A ) . To investigate the domain re - quirements of Abp1p for actin filament binding and Arp2 / 3 activation , we purified a set of Abp1p mutants as GST fu - sion proteins ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . GST was left on the fusion proteins because attempts to remove GST by thrombin di - gestion resulted in severe proteolysis of Abp1p . Deletion of the amino - terminal ADF - H domain dis - rupted both actin - filament binding ( Fig . 4 C ) and Arp2 / 3 activation ( D ) , while deletion of the SH3 domain of Abp1p caused no change in either activity ( not shown ) . The ADF - H domain alone had limited solubility , and therefore we were unable to test its activity in F - actin copelleting assays . It also showed no activity in the pyrene actin assembly assay ( data not shown ) , possibly because it is not folded correctly . Triple substitutions ( DDW / AAA ) within either acidic motif of Abp1p disrupted Arp2 / 3 acti - vation , but not completely ( Fig . 4 E ) . These mutations had no effect on actin filament binding ( Fig . 4 C ) . A double mutant targeting both acidic motifs caused a stronger neg - ative effect on Arp2 / 3 activation than each single mutant alone . Like the single mutants , this double mutant had no effect on actin - filament binding ( Fig . 4 , C and E ) . Genetic Interactions Support an In Vivo Role for Arp2 / 3 Activation by Abp1p To test the in vivo relevance of the Abp1p - Arp2 / 3 complex activity , we introduced the double acidic sequence mutant ( A - N * C * ) into genetic backgrounds in which the abp1 D mu - tant has a phenotype : sla1 - 7 , sla2 - 5 , and sac6 - 102 . Although no synthetic effects were seen in combination with sla1 - 7 or sla2 - 5 , the ABP1 double acidic mutant reduced the permis - sive temperature of growth in the sac6 - 102 background , in - dicating that Arp2 / 3 complex activation by Abp1p is impor - tant in vivo ( Fig . 5 ) . However , the effects were not as strong as a complete abp1 deletion ( see Discussion ) . Discussion We have identified a new activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex , the conserved actin binding protein Abp1p . This protein has been linked functionally to endocytosis by a number of studies in yeast and mammalian cells ( reviewed in Qual - mann et al . , 2000 ; also see below ) . Our data therefore suggest that Abp1p links Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly to a step in endocytosis . They also provide im - portant insights into the mechanism ( s ) by which activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex can be achieved . A New Mechanism for Arp2 / 3 Complex Activation : Recruitment to the Sides of Actin Filaments The most well - characterized activators of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex are ActA ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) and SCAR / WASp ( Ma - Figure 2 .

Arp2 / 3 Complex Activation by Abp1p 631 chesky et al . , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Winter et al . , 1999 ; Yarar et al . , 1999 ) . These factors require both an acidic motif and an actin monomer binding domain for activation ( reviewed in Higgs and Pollard , 1999 ) . Similar to ActA and SCAR / WASp proteins , Abp1p requires acidic se - quences for activating the Arp2 / 3 complex . However , a key difference is that ActA and SCAR / WASp require a single acidic sequence for activation , whereas Abp1p re - quires two acidic sequences for full activation . A possible explanation for this requirement is discussed below . An - other fundamental difference between Abp1p and ActA or SCAR / WASp is that activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by Abp1p requires an actin filament binding domain in - stead of an actin monomer binding domain . Importantly , this demonstrates that actin monomer binding is not a strict requirement for activation . Fungal type I myosin ( Lee et al . , 2000 ) may work by a similar mechanism . How - ever , it has not yet been established whether the carboxyl terminus of this myosin I , which activates the Arp2 / 3 com - plex in vitro , binds to actin monomers and / or actin fila - ments . Actin filament binding of Abp1p is mediated by its ADF - H domain , consistent with functional analyses of mouse Abp1 ( Kessels et al . , 2000 ) . Our data support the hypothesis that the ADF - H module has been adapted for different interactions with actin ( Lappalainen et al . , 1998 ) . Twinfilins use these modules to bind specifically to actin Figure 3 . Abp1p binds directly to actin filaments and to the Arp2 / 3 complex .

A careful structural and functional comparison of ADF - H domains in twinfi - lin , Abp1p , and cofilin / ADF would help reveal how func - tional diversity is achieved in this module . How , then , does actin filament binding by Abp1p con - tribute to Arp2 / 3 complex activation ? It has been shown that activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex increases markedly upon association with actin filaments ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ) . However , the Arp2 / 3 complex has a relatively weak binding affinity for actin filaments ( K d 5 2 m M ; Mullins et al . , 1998 ; and this study ) . We demonstrated that Abp1p has a strong actin filament binding affinity ( K d , 0 . 1 m M ) and recruits Arp2 / 3 complex to filaments . This effect was not due to an increase in the number of pointed ends caused by an Abp1p severing activity . Even high concen - trations of Abp1p did not increase the rate of actin fila - ment disassembly or assembly ( not shown ) , characteristics Figure 4 .

Arp2 / 3 Complex Activation by Abp1p 633 of filament - severing proteins . Based on these data , we propose that Abp1p may activate Arp2 / 3 complex - medi - ated actin nucleation by recruiting Arp2 / 3 complex to fila - ment sides . This model also provides an explanation for why Abp1p requires two acidic sequences for full activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . It has been suggested that ActA and SCAR / WASp proteins may stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex by a “hit and run” mechanism ( Higgs and Pollard , 1999 ) , which would require only transient interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex . This is consistent with their relatively weak bind - ing affinities to activators for Arp2 / 3 complex ( e . g . , WASp has a K d z 1 m M ; Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast , Abp1p binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex with much higher affinity , re - maining tightly and stoichiometrically associated through gel filtration ( Fig . 1 ) at 0 . 3 m M each of Abp1p and Arp2 / 3 complex . This observation indicates that Abp1p binds to Arp2 / 3 complex with a dissociation constant well below 0 . 3 m M . Abp1p also displaces efficiently the “WA” fragment of human SCAR protein from Arp2 / 3 complex in binding competition experiments ( B . L . Goode , unpublished data ) . Therefore , Abp1p may require two acidic sequences to an - chor the Arp2 / 3 complex effectively to the sides of actin fil - aments , which in turn promotes Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated nucleation of actin assembly . The Cellular Functions of Abp1p Until now , the only activities found for Abp1p were actin filament binding ( through its ADF - H domain ) and inter - actions with other proteins ( e . g . , Rvs167p / amphiphysin and Srv2p / CAP ) through its carboxyl - terminal SH3 do - main and proline - rich region . These binding interactions led to the hypothesis that Abp1 might serve as an adapter , linking actin filaments to endocytic machinery ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . Our demonstration here that Abp1p stimu - lates Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin nucleation suggests that Abp1p may link activated actin polymerization to an endocytic function . Evidence that Arp2 / 3 activation by Abp1p is important in vivo comes from the observation that mutation of the two acidic sequences in Abp1p en - hanced the severity of the phenotype resulting from muta - tion of the actin filament cross - linking protein , Sac6p / fim - brin . Further genetic investigations will be required to elucidate the specific in vivo roles of Arp2 / 3 activation by Abp1p , and to determine whether this activity is important for Abp1p’s endocytic function . Note Added in Proof . After our manuscript was submit - ted , two publications appeared that demonstrate activa - tion of the Arp2 / 3 complex by the actin filament binding protein cortactin . This work shows that cortactin requires its actin filament binding domain for activation , and thus its mechanism for activation may be similar to that of Abp1p ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) .
