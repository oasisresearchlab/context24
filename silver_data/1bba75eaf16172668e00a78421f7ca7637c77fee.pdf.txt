Yet , how spatial genome architecture is related to gene expression and cell fate remains un - clear . We comprehensively mapped 3D chromatin organization during mouse neural differentiation in vitro and in vivo , generating the highest - resolution Hi - C maps available to date . We found that transcrip - tion is correlated with chromatin insulation and long - range interactions , but dCas9 - mediated activation is insufﬁcient for creating TAD boundaries de novo . Additionally , we discovered long - range contacts between gene bodies of exon - rich , active genes in all cell types . During neural differentiation , contacts between active TADs become less pronounced while inactive TADs interact more strongly . An extensive Polycomb network in stem cells is disrupted , while dynamic interactions between neural transcrip - tion factors appear in vivo . Finally , cell type - speciﬁc enhancer - promoter contacts are established concomitant to gene expression . This work shows that multiple factors inﬂuence the dynamics of chro - matin interactions in development . INTRODUCTION Genome - wide 3D chromosome organization mapping technolo - gies have revealed important insights on genome folding , but many fundamental questions remain open ( Bonev and Cavalli , 2016 ; Dekker and Mirny , 2016 ; Dixon et al . , 2016 ) . Regulatory in - formation , encoded in the spatial proximity of functional ele - ments , exists at all levels—from histone - DNA interactions to interchromosomal and chromatin - lamina interactions . However , our understanding of the interaction dynamics at the smallest scales during developmental processes is currently limited . At intermediate scales ( 100 kb to 1 Mb ) , a major discovery is the existence of topologically associating domains ( TADs ) ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ; Sexton et al . , 2012 ) . Domain insulation has been shown to be important for gene expression and physiology ( Flavahan et al . , 2016 ; Lupia´n˜ez et al . , 2015 ) . It is known that architectural proteins such as CTCF and cohesin play a role ( Haarhuis et al . , 2017 ; Nora et al . , 2017 ; Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ) , and recently , novel models such as ‘‘loop extrusion’’ have been proposed to explain domain formation ( Fudenberg et al . , 2016 ; Sanborn et al . , 2015 ) . However , the relation between such models and transcription remains unclear . At larger scales , interactions between domains are thought to give rise to two main types of spatial compartments referred to as ‘‘A’’ and ‘‘B’’ ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ) , which are func - tionally related to gene expression and can switch extensively during differentiation ( Dixon et al . , 2015 ) . The deposition of chro - matin marks is thought to contribute to this process ( Dixon et al . , 2015 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ) , and recent evidence indicates that do - mains and compartment formation can be at least partially un - coupled and may result from different biological phenomena ( Nora et al . , 2017 ) . Hi - C is uniquely poised to probe all of these aspects of 3D chromatin architecture . However , given the enormous number of possible contacts in the genome , very few studies using mostly in vitro cultured cells have achieved high resolution ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , the major effect of the cell cycle on chromosome architecture ( Nagano et al . , 2017 ; Naumova et al . , 2013 ) is rarely accounted for in 3D genome mapping studies . These issues have led to a conundrum , since depending on the method used , different studies highlight different and sometimes contrasting views of chromosome folding . Here , we comprehensively mapped 3D chromatin organiza - tion at very high resolution using a well - deﬁned cell differentia - tion system ( Gaspard et al . , 2008 ) in which we controlled for cell type heterogeneity and cell - cycle variation . We focused on neural differentiation and cortical development as a paradigm and performed ultra - deep coverage Hi - C on mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESs ) , neural progenitors ( NPCs ) , and cortical neurons ( CNs ) . Furthermore , using transgenic mouse lines , we puriﬁed NPCs and CNs directly from the developing mouse embryonic neocortex in vivo . In total , we sequenced over 40 billion paired - end reads that resulted in more than 17 billion uniquely mapped contacts .

Our data demonstrate that cellular differentiation involves changes at all scales of folding , and in addition to CTCF - dependent processes , it in - cludes major changes in Polycomb and in transcription factor ( TF ) interaction networks . This rich dataset provides a framework to study dynamic chromatin interactions and their inﬂuence on gene expression and cell fate . RESULTS Global Reorganization of the 3D Genome during Neural Differentiation We used transgenic cell lines expressing GFP either from the Oct4 , Sox1 ( Ying et al . , 2003 ) , or Tau ( Mapt ) ( Bibel et al . , 2004 ) loci to obtain highly pure populations corresponding to the respective cell type : ES , NPC , or CN ( Figures S1A – S1C ) . In addi - tion , we employed a ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) approach , which allowed us to purify G 0 G 1 cells based on DNA content ( Figures S1B and S1H ) . By using in situ Hi - C ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) , we produced over 11 billion uniquely aligned contacts ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ) . Bio - logical replicates were highly correlated at all resolutions ( Fig - ure S1D ) and for each different cell type ( Figures S1E and S2A ) . We reached a maximum resolution of 750 bp—the highest to date ( Figure S1F ) . Analysis of these Hi - C data showed a global reorganization in chromatin interactions during differentiation ( Figures 1B , 1C , S1G , and S2B ) . We then identiﬁed TADs and classiﬁed them into two compartments : active ( A ) and inactive ( B ) ( Figures S1I and S2C , Table S2 , and STAR Methods ) . We observed that the number of compartment borders decreases with differ - entiation and conﬁrmed these results using an analysis based on the eigenvector value ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig - ures 1D and S1J ) . Surprisingly , the interaction strength be - tween A - type domains decreased , whereas contacts within the B compartment became stronger between NPCs and CNs ( Figures 1E and S1L ) . Average contact enrichment be - tween pairs of 100 - kb loci arranged by their eigenvalue conﬁrmed these results ( Figure 1F ) . In addition , the correlation between signal enrichment and eigenvector value for active his - tone marks decreased during differentiation , while the anti - cor - relation between H3K9me3 and the eigenvector value became stronger ( Figure 1G ) . Analysis of the contact map ( STAR Methods ) between several B - type regions also conﬁrmed increased interaction strength during differentiation ( Figures 1H and S2D ) . In conclusion , a major genome - folding reprogramming occurs during neural differentiation with a progressive increase in compartment size , decreased interactions within the A compart - ment , and a concomitant increase in interactions between B - type domains . Transcription Is Correlated with but Not Sufﬁcient to Induce Insulation at TAD Boundaries De Novo We then examined TADs and found that their number decreased during differentiation ( Figure S3A ) , with a corresponding in - crease in size ( Figure S3B ) . Analysis of TAD boundaries revealed that the proportion of the CTCF - less borders increased during differentiation ( Figure S3C ) . In addition to CTCF , cohesin and transcription have also been suggested to play a role in boundary formation ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Fudenberg et al . , 2016 ) , although given low resolution of TAD boundaries in previous studies , it has been difﬁcult to disentangle the role of these other factors from that of CTCF . We thus examined the signal enrichment of CTCF , of Smc1 , and of several transcription - related chromatin marks around TAD borders in ESs . We observed three classes of boundaries : CTCF - positive boundaries , CTCF - negative boundaries close to active gene promoters , and a set of boundaries without enrich - ment of active marks ( Figure 2A ) . Importantly , cohesin was found both at CTCF - positive boundaries , where it colocalized with CTCF , and on CTCF - negative borders marked by active tran - scription ( Figure 2A ) . The third set of boundaries appear to repre - sent repeats ( Figure 2B ) , consistent with previous ﬁndings ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ) . The existence of three types of boundaries was conﬁrmed in CN cells ( Figure 2C ) . TAD boundaries were reported to be mostly conserved be - tween different cell types and even across species ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ) , yet the mechanisms contributing to developmentally regulated borders remain poorly understood . Highly conserved boundaries in our system were characterized by a small but consistent increase in insulation during differenti - ation ( Figures S3D – S3F ) . We classiﬁed developmentally regu - lated TAD boundaries into ES - speciﬁc and neural - speciﬁc regions ( Figure 2D ) and veriﬁed that these borders represent a genuine loss or gain of insulation , respectively , using aggregate Hi - C maps ( Figure 2E ) , insulation score ( Figures S3G and S3H ) , and directionality index ( DI ) ( Figure S3I ) . We found that genes located in close proximity to the neural - speciﬁc TAD boundaries tend to be upregulated ( Figures 2Fi and 2Gi ) , while genes located close to ES - speciﬁc borders are less active in differentiated cells ( Figures 2Fii and 2Gii ) . We examined one such neural - speciﬁc region , where a novel TAD boundary was formed at the transcriptional start site ( Tss ) of Zfp608 during differentiation ( Figure 2H ) , concomitant with the activation of the gene ( Figure S3J ) but in the absence of CTCF binding . We also examined two other neural genes : Sox4 and Sox11 . CTCF was bound to the Sox4 promoter already in ESs , yet insulation dramatically increased only when the gene became expressed at the NPC stage ( Figures S3K and S3J ) . For Sox11 , we also observed increased CTCF binding at its pro - moter ( Figure S3L ) . Remarkably , the changes in insulation were highly similar to the changes in transcription across all three genes ( Figure S3J ) . Next , we asked whether some aspects of novel TAD boundary formation are also conserved in human ( G ) Spearman’s correlation between the eigenvector value and ChIP - seq signal enrichment in 100 - kb bins .

( legend continued on next page ) 560 Cell 171 , 557 – 572 , October 19 , 2017 cortical development . Despite the much lower resolution of the Hi - C maps available ( Dixon et al . , 2015 ; Won et al . , 2016 ) , we observed a similar increase in insulation around SOX11 ( Figure S3M ) . Finally , we asked if RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) recruitment is sufﬁcient to cause chromatin insulation . We used the CRISPR - dCas9 system ( Konermann et al . , 2015 ) to activate gene expres - sion at the endogenous Zfp608 and Sox4 loci , which did not cause precocious neural differentiation ( Figure S3N ) . We then performed Hi - C and found that despite more than 10 - to 20 - fold gene activation , which is comparable to expression levels in NPCs , there was no signiﬁcant change in the contact maps or the insulation score at the examined loci ( Figures 2I and 2J ) . Therefore , transcriptional activation per se appears insufﬁcient to cause chromatin insulation and create a TAD boundary . In summary , transcription is correlated to chromatin insulation in a manner that can be independent from CTCF binding . The proportion of CTCF - less TAD boundaries , located close to or at active gene promoters , increases during neural differentiation . However , transcription is not sufﬁcient to cause chromatin insu - lation at these loci . Dynamic CTCF - Based Loops and Insulation during Neural Differentiation Chromatin insulation occurs at multiple levels and leads to a hierarchical 3D nuclear organization , whereby smaller , less insu - lated regions ( called also sub - TADs [ Flavahan et al . , 2016 ; Phil - lips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ] or contact domains [ Rao et al . , 2014 ] ) are nested inside TADs , which are usually bigger and more strongly insulated ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ; Sexton et al . , 2012 ) . We observed that average intra - TAD contacts become stron - ger , while inter - TAD contacts appear to be depleted during differentiation ( Figures 3A and S4A ) . In addition , the average con - tact enrichment at the loop between two TAD boundaries also increased ( Figure 3A ) . As most of the TAD boundaries are bound by CTCF , we also quantiﬁed the interaction strength between convergent CTCF sites using aggregate Hi - C maps ( STAR Methods ) . We observed strong enrichment as expected ( Guo et al . , 2015 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ) , and the loops were constrained pri - marily inside TADs and rarely crossed TAD boundaries ( Figures 3B and 3D ) . However , the overall enrichment of CTCF - mediated contacts increased with neural differentiation , and even inter - domain contacts became apparent ( Figures 3B – 3D and S4B ) . Inaddition , CTCFsites insulated adjacent regionsasymmetrically based on their motif orientation ( Figure S4C ) . As many as 40 – 50 % of the CTCF sites may change in different cell types ( Chen et al . , 2012 ) . To test whether differences in CTCF binding could be related to cell - type speciﬁc chromatin interac - tions , we compared CTCF binding between ESs and NPCs ( Fig - ure S4D ) . Conserved CTCF were characterized by strong interactions in the convergent orientation ( Figures 3E and 3F ) and by strong insulation both in ESs and NPCs ( Figure S4E ) . In contrast , both the contact enrichment and the insulation be - tween ES - speciﬁc CTCF regions were decreased in NPCs ( Fig - ures 3E , 3F and S4F ) . Next , we examined one of the regions with predicted ES - spe - ciﬁc CTCF interaction ( Figure 3G , dashed circle ) . During differen - tiation , only the forward CTCF site became inaccessible to CTCF , and the chromatin loop disappeared ( Figure 3G ) . To conﬁrm this result , we used three - color ﬂuorescence in situ hy - bridization ( FISH ) with probes at the forward CTCF site , reverse site , and an equidistant upstream region ( Figure 3G ) . Consistent with Hi - C ( Figure S4G ) , only the 3D FISH distance between the pair of probes containing the forward and the reverse CTCF site increased during differentiation , while the other probe pairs displayed the opposite effect ( Figures 3H , S4H , and S4I ) . Active Gene Promoters and the Bodies of Exon - Rich Genes Interact at Multiple Genomic Scales We wondered if gene expression , local insulation , and chromatin contacts are also correlated even outside TAD borders . Using aggregate Hi - C maps , we identiﬁed a strong preference for insu - lation centered on active Tss , but not on inactive ones , a phe - nomenon that was not dependent on CTCF binding ( Figures 4A , 4B , S5A , and S5B ) . Next , we asked whether differences in insulation are also correlated with expression levels . We found that insulation scaled gradually with gene expression based on the insulation score ( Figures 4C and S5C ) and aggregate Hi - C maps ( Fig - ure 4D ) . Interestingly , general TFs such as Taf3 ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) appear to enhance interaction between promoters but had little effect on insulation ( Figure S5D ) . Interactions between active promoters have been observed with other methods ( chromatin interaction analysis by paired - end tag sequencing [ ChIA - PET ] and promoter - capture Hi - C ) ( Li et al . , 2012 ; Schoenfelder et al . , 2015a ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) , but due to the selectivity of these approaches , it is unclear to what extent promoter interactions are enriched above the local genomic average . We observed that interactions occur exclu - sively between the promoters of active genes ( Figures 4E and S5E ) and that active chromatin loops span across domains ( D ) HierarchicalclusteringofdifferentialTADboundariesbasedontheinsulationscore .

Furthermore , most of these interactions were not mediated by CTCF ( Figure 4F ) and were readily identiﬁed in all three cell types ( Figure 4G ) . Impor - tantly , we observed no central enrichment when we performed the same analysis using instead 3 0 gene ends ( Figure S5F ) , showing that these interactions were speciﬁc to promoters and were correlated with the level of expression ( Figures 4H and S5J ) . As an example verifying these observations , we show the contact maps at the locus of the neuronal gene Rnd3 ( Figures S5H and S5I ) . Previous studies suggested that active promoters might engage in loops with their cognate 3 0 gene ends in a process that might facilitate recycling of RNA pol II after the end of tran - scription ( Tan - Wong et al . , 2012 ) . Aggregate Hi - C maps of intra - genic contacts showed that active promoters contact the whole transcribed region of the gene ( Figure S5G ) , suggesting that the contacts with the promoter are maintained throughout the act of transcription , and not just at the time of transcription termination . Surprisingly , we also identiﬁed clusters of very long - range ( > 30 Mb ) chromatin contacts between bodies of expressed genes in cis ( Figures 4I and S5K ) and also in trans ( Figure S5L ) . Unexpectedly , the contact enrichment between gene bodies was highly correlated not only with expression levels , but also with the number of exons per gene ( Figures 4J , 4K , and 4M ) , and was evident across a large range of genomic distances ( Fig - ure S5M ) in all three cell types ( Figure 4N ) . Importantly , this effect was stronger for genes with more splicing events , even when we controlled for gene length ( Figure 4L ) . In summary , promoters of active genes are characterized by strong insulation , which is correlated with transcriptional activity , but is mostly CTCF independent . Active Tss maintain contacts with the gene body and , contrary to CTCF interactions , can interact with other transcribed Tss across TAD boundaries . Finally , actively transcribed genes with a large number of exons engage in long - range chromatin loops in clusters both in cis - and in trans . Polycomb - Mediated Interactions Are Disrupted Independently of H3K27me3 during Neural Differentiation Polycomb - mediated interactions have been previously reported in mouse ESs using a Capture - C approach ( Schoenfelder et al . , 2015b ) and are a prominent feature in Drosophila ( Bantignies et al . , 2011 ) . Unexpectedly , we observed a strong decrease in contact intensity between common H3K27me3 sites , which was especially notable at long distances ( Figure S6A ) . This loss of contacts correlated better with Ring1B than with H3K27me3 on these sites ( Figures S6B and S6C ) . In ESs , strong contact enrichment between conserved Ring1B sites , which decreased during differentiation , was evident in both intra - and inter - domain pairs and also across long distances ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . Although the vast majority of these shared Ring1B sites were marked by both Ring1B and H3K27me3 ( Figure 5C ) , the absolute levels of Ring1B decreased during differentiation ( with only a mild effect on gene expression [ Figure S6D ] ) , while H3K27me3 levels did not ( Figure 5D ) . Finally , the strength of pairwise con - tacts was highly correlated to the level of Ring1B rather than that of H3K27me3 , even in ESs ( Figures 5E and 5F ) . These ﬁnd - ings are illustrated at the HoxA - Vax2 ( Figure S6E ) , Zfp503 - Zmiz1 ( Figures S6F and S6G ) and Hoxa9 - Tlx2 genomic loci ( Figures 5G , 5H , S6H , and S6I ) . As the majority of strong Polycomb - bound regions are on gene promoters , we examined whether their interaction might depend on paused Pol II that is located at bivalent gene promoters ( Min et al . , 2011 ) . To address this question , we examined NPC - spe - ciﬁc Ring1B sites . Cacna2d1 is repressed in ESs and NPCs ( Fig - ure S6K ) . Importantly , a loop was formed speciﬁcally in NPCs between the Cacna2d1 promoter and another NPC - speciﬁc Ring1B site located (cid:2) 500 kb downstream in the gene body ( Fig - ure S6J ) . Skap2 is a gene expressed in ESs where , as expected , it did not contact the adjacent HoxA complex ( Figure 5I ) . In NPCs , Skap2 became repressed ( Figure S6L ) , bound by Ring1B and H3K27me3 , and acquired strong interactions with the HoxA cluster ( Figure 5I ) . Based on these results , we concluded that Polycomb - mediated chromatin contacts are not exclusive to bivalent gene promoters and that they are unlikely to be a conse - quence of paused Pol II at bivalent Tss . Collectively , these data suggest that Polycomb - mediated in - teractions are among the strongest in mouse ESs but become progressively disrupted with neuronal differentiation . However , Polycomb - mediated interactions are maintained or even enhanced at a small subset of genes in a manner that is highly correlated with the levels of Ring1B bound to its target loci . Cell - Type Speciﬁc Chromatin Folding Is Organized around the Neural Transcription Factors Pax6 , NeuroD2 , and Tbr1 In Vivo In ESs , Nanog and Oct4 have been proposed to bring distant chromatin loci together in close proximity ( de Wit et al . , 2013 ) . Using aggregate Hi - C maps , we conﬁrmed that Nanog - bound sites interact above background in ESs . These interactions Figure 3 .

Next , we turned our attention to neural - speciﬁc TFs . However , very few public chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) proﬁles exist , and most of those have been per - formed in the developing mouse neocortex ( Bayam et al . , 2015 ; Notwell et al . , 2016 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , although the in vitro system we employed recapitulates some aspects of cortical development , other features , such as neuronal migration and morphogen signaling , are not . Therefore , we decided to purify NPC or CN populations directly from the mouse neocortex in vivo , hereafter called ncx NPC and ncx CN , respectively ( Figures 6A , 6B , S7B , and S7C ) . We performed RNA - seq and veriﬁed our approach using known markers for neural progenitors ( Nestin ) and differentiating neurons ( Dcx ) ( Fig - ure S7D ) . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) also conﬁrmed that NPC populations , either in vitro or in vivo , are highly similar to each other and are distinct from CNs and vice versa ( Figure S8A ) . We performed Hi - C on the puriﬁed NPC and CN populations in vivo and obtained a total of (cid:2) 3 billion uniquely aligned con - tacts per cell type ( Table S1 ) . Pearson correlation coefﬁcient ( Figure S7E ) , comparison of the eigenvector values , insulation score , and contact probability ( Figures S7G and S8A ) conﬁrmed the high quality of the data and that , importantly , samples group together based on cell type . Nevertheless , we observed some important differences between the two systems . Some well - known neuronal TFs such as Eomes ( marker for basal progeni - tors ) , Neurog2 , Pax6 , NeuroD2 , and Tbr1 were expressed in the appropriate cell type more strongly in vivo than in vitro ( Fig - ure S7F ) . Moreover , we identiﬁed regions that switch compart - ments between the in vitro and the in vivo systems , which were accompanied with corresponding changes in gene expression ( Figures S8B and S8C ) . Pax6 is one of the few ‘‘master regulator’’ neural TFs with a well - known role in cortical development ( Manuel et al . , 2015 ) . We observed a cell - type speciﬁc contact enrichment between Pax6 - bound sites strongest in ncx NPC where Pax6 is highly expressed ( Figures 6C and 6D ) . Interestingly , in contrast to Nanog or Polycomb - mediated interactions , Pax6 contacts were mostly conﬁned within TAD boundaries ( Figures 6C , 6D , and S7O ) . We observed a similar—albeit less strong—trend in the in vitro differentiated cells ( Figure S7K ) , consistent with the lower Pax6 expression levels in NPCs in vitro ( Figure S7F ) . In order to verify these ﬁndings , we examined a (cid:2) 0 . 5 - Mb region interacting with the neural gene Brn1 , which is expressed strongly in NPCs in vivo ( Figures 6G and 6H ) . The promoter of Brn1 is bound by Pax6 in ncx NPC , and there are multiple H3K27ac - markedPax6bindingsiteswithin Brn1 TAD ( Figure6F ) . Hi - C analysis identiﬁed conserved , presumably CTCF - mediated contacts ( Figure 6F , arrowheads ) present in all cell types and several NPC - speciﬁc contacts precisely located at Pax6 - bound sites ( Figure 6F , green arrows ) . Next , we examined two other neuronal TFs : NeuroD2 ( Bayam et al . , 2015 ) and Tbr1 ( Notwell et al . , 2016 ) . NeuroD2 and Tbr1 in - teractions were also mostly constrained inside TADs ( Figures 6C , 6D , S7P , and S7Q ) but increased during differentiation and were the strongest in CNs in vivo . A similar but weaker trend was observed in the in vitro system ( Figures S7L and S7M ) , once again consistent with the lower expression levels in vitro ( Figure S7F ) . Finally , we asked if the interactions between TF - bound loci change because of transcriptional activation or because of ‘‘homotypic’’ interactions between loci bound by the same factor . We found that the contact enrichment is highest be - tween a distal site and a Tss when they are both bound by the same TF ( Figures 6E and S7H ) . This dynamic organization of chromatin contacts around neural TFs is evident at the FoxG1 locus , where cell - type speciﬁc interactions were organized around Pax6 and NeuroD2 binding sites ( Fig - ure 6G ) , even though FoxG1 was expressed in both NPCs and CNs ( Figure 6H ) . Collectively , these data show that dynamic chromatin inter - actions are much more prevalent than previously anticipated . They are frequently related to cell - type speciﬁc TFs , which contribute to a distinct chromosome folding . TADs appear to constrain the interactions between some , but not all , TFs , Figure 4 .

( legend continued on next page ) 568 Cell 171 , 557 – 572 , October 19 , 2017 Enhancer - Promoter Contacts Are Mostly Cell - Type Speciﬁc and Are Generally Established Concomitantly with Gene Expression Enhancer - promoter ( E - P ) contacts have been difﬁcult to observe in Hi - C , and it is unclear how strong they are compared to the surrounding regions . Using aggregate Hi - C maps , we observed enrichment only between pairs of enhancers and active pro - moters , but not when we examined repressed genes ( Fig - ure S8D ) . Importantly , pairwise E - P interactions were con - strained primarily inside TADs ( Figure S8D ) , were gradually increased during differentiation in vitro and in vivo for CN - based pairs ( Figures 7A and 7B ) , and were not strongly dependent on CTCF binding ( Figure S8E ) . Furthermore , intra - TAD - E - P interac - tions were strongest in their respective cell type ( Figures S8F and S8G and Table S3 ) . These results suggest that E - P interactions are highly dy - namic and cell - type speciﬁc . To directly address this hypothe - sis , we clustered highly variable genes based on expression and found that the change in average expression is highly correlated with the change in average E - P interaction score within a cluster ( Figures 7C – 7E ) . Furthermore , the average Hi - C scores and the correlation between expression and chro - matin contacts were strongly decreased when we randomly shufﬂed the position of the enhancer region within the same TAD ( Figures 7D , 7E , and S8H ) . Analogous results were ob - tained in vivo ( Figure S8I ) . In order to conﬁrm these ﬁndings , we also used the ‘‘gene speciﬁcity score’’ as described previ - ously ( Javierre et al . , 2016 ) . We observed high correlation be - tween scores based either on gene expression or on average E - P Hi - C score per gene , both in vitro ( Figures S8J – S8L ) and in vivo ( Figure S8M ) . Next , we examined selected differentially expressed genes . We identiﬁed a NPC - speciﬁc enhancer , which interacted strongly with the promoter of the neuronal TF Brn2 gene only in NPCs , and this interaction was disrupted in CNs when the enhancer was inactive ( Figure 7F ) . Sox2 interacts with a super - enhancer in ESs ( Li et al . , 2014 ) and has been suggested to undergo an enhancer switch be - tween ESs and NPCs based on 5C data ( Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ) . We observed a strong decrease in the interactions between Sox2 promoter and the ES - speciﬁc enhancer ( Fig - ure 7G , blue arrow ) during differentiation , which coincides with a decrease in both CTCF binding and the H3K27ac mark on the enhancer ( Figure 7Gi ) . Conversely , the contact between Sox2 promoter and the NPC - speciﬁc enhancer ( Figure 7G , green arrow ) increased in NPCs . Importantly , our high resolution al - lowed us to discriminate between a conserved CTCF - mediated contact located less than 20 kb away from the enhancer and the E - P interaction , which is evident only in NPCs when the enhancer is active ( Figure 7Gii ) . We also identiﬁed two putative NPC - spe - ciﬁc Sox2 enhancers ( Figure 7G , green arrowheads ) , which inde - pendently gained H3K27ac and contacted Sox2 promoter pri - marily in NPCs ( Figure 7G ) . Collectively , the data show that E - P interactions are primarily intra - TAD and are dynamically regulated during development . Although we did identify instances of pre - set chromatin interac - tions between enhancers and their cognate target genes that precede transcriptional activation ( Figures 7C , S8N , and S8O ) , the majority of those interactions appear to be established concomitantly to gene expression and are also disrupted when the genes become repressed . This suggests that regulating the contact probability between an enhancer and a promoter may represent an important mechanism in the control of gene expres - sion and cell fate . DISCUSSION The analysis of a well - controlled differentiation system and its in vivo cell counterparts shows that cell differentiation is accom - panied by a global chromatin reorganization and a change in compartmentalization with a decrease in long - range interactions between A - type domains concomitant with an increase in con - tacts between inactive B - type domains . Previous studies have shown that heterochromatin regions aggregate in the center of the nucleus in retinal neurons ( Solovei et al . , 2013 ) or that olfac - tory receptor genes interact strongly in postmitotic neurons ( Clowney et al . , 2012 ) . Importantly , in both cases , a reduction in the levels of lamin B receptor was observed , which is also evident in our differentiation system ( Figure S1K ) , suggesting a common mechanism . In addition , the high spatial resolution achieved allowed disen - tangling the roles of different , closely located chromatin components in insulation and long - range contacts . We found transcription to be highly correlated with local chromatin insula - tion . Therefore , although we conﬁrmed that most TAD bound - aries are conserved ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ) , novel borders can occur at promoters of developmentally regulated genes . Furthermore , the correlation between transcription and insulation also extends within TADs . However , we show that activating transcription is not sufﬁcient to cause chromatin insulation , and thus , other fac - tors such as E - P interactions and speciﬁc TFs likely contribute to creating insulation . Alternatively , changes in chromatin confor - mation precede and may enable gene expression at speciﬁc loci . These ﬁndings complement recent results in Drosophila development , which suggested that transcription is not neces - sary for boundary formation ( Hug et al . , 2017 ) . We show that , consistent with previous ﬁndings ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) , CTCF sites interact predominantly in the convergent orientation ; however , the strength of this type of contact in - creases during differentiation . This is somewhat counterintuitive , as the absolute levels of CTCF binding actually decrease during differentiation . An alternative explanation might be that cohesin ( F ) Hi - C contact maps showing (cid:2) 2 . 6 - Mb region around Brn2 promoter . Insets show a magniﬁed view of the contact between the Brn2 promoter and an NPC - speciﬁc enhancer ( dashed circle ) . ( G ) Hi - Ccontactmapsshowing (cid:2) 2 - Mbregionatthe Sox2 locus .

Insets showing the interaction between Sox2 promoter and an ES - speciﬁc enhancer ( blue arrow , Gi ) ; or Sox2 promoter and a known NPC - speciﬁc enhancer ( green arrow , Gii ) . See also Figure S8 and Table S3 . Cell 171 , 557 – 572 , October 19 , 2017 569 binding and potentially the processivity of the loop - extruding complex might be affected . Consistent with this hypothesis , we ﬁnd that expression of cohesin unloading factors such as Wapl and Pds5a is decreased during neural differentiation ( Fig - ure S4J ) , and the increase in looping strength and contact fre - quency upon Wapl removal in human cells ( Haarhuis et al . , 2017 ) correlates well with this . In addition to CTCF and promoters , we showed that different types of chromatin contact behaviors and loops coexist in different cell types . Surprisingly , we ﬁnd that the bodies of highly expressed genes interact strongly both in cis and in trans to form clusters of loops . These interactions are strongly correlated with the number of splicing events per gene with the strongest contacts occurring between genes that undergo most splicing . Splicing foci have been observed in live cells ( Rino et al . , 2007 ) , but whether the contacts we observed are directly linked to co - transcriptional splicing remains to be seen . In ESs , the strong long - range interactions also involve Poly - comb - bound genes and , to a lesser extent , genes bound by pluripotency TFs . These networks are reorganized in neuronal differentiation , which in the case of Polycomb appears to corre - late with PRC1 binding levels . Within the neural lineage , we observed increased contact strength between loci bound by distinct TFs . These interactions are cell - type speciﬁc and point to a potential novel role of these TFs in cortical development . These contacts do not appear to be just a consequence of transcription activation , but it remains to be seen if they truly represent homotypic interactions . In that re - gard , Pax6 has been shown to directly interact with members of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex ( also known as mSWI / SNF ) in adult neural progenitors ( Ninkovic et al . , 2013 ) , but whether and how that contributes to chromatin architecture is unknown . Finally , E - P interactions are highly dynamic and are usually es - tablished concomitantly with gene expression . The high resolu - tion of our Hi - C approach allowed us to determine the contact strength of the E - P interactions relative to the surrounding re - gions while controlling for global changes such as compaction . Our observations support a model where dynamic chromatin looping from enhancer regions triggers gene activation ( Deng et al . , 2014 ) , although clear violations of this principle exist , as previously seen in Drosophila , where many E - P loops are pre - es - tablished ( Ghavi - Helm et al . , 2014 ) . This work provides a comprehensive view of chromatin orga - nization . It shows that different regulatory factors establish pref - erential contacts at different scales . These range from close cis interactions such as promoter - gene body ; to long - range TAD - delimited contacts such as those between enhancers and promoters and TF binding sites ; and ﬁnally , to very long - range contacts involving promoters , Polycomb , heterochromatin re - gions , and a subset of TF binding sites . This comprehensive da - taset thus provides a rich resource to study dynamic chromatin interactions involving different regulatory players of cell fate and differentiation . From a developmental perspective , ultra - deep Hi - C maps from puriﬁed neocortical cell populations will additionally allow for a deeper understanding of how genome ar - chitecture is related to function in vivo .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Cell Lines E14Tg2a , Oct4 - GFP and Sox1 - GFP feeder - free or Tau - GFP ( grown on irradiated CF - 1 MEF feeders ( Tebu - Bio , Cat . N : GSC - 6001G ) ) cell lines were maintained as described in ( Gaspard et al . , 2008 ) . In brief , cells were cultured in DMEM ( ThermoFished , Cat . N : 21969 - 035 ) , suppelemented with 15 % FBS ( ES - qualiﬁed , ThermoFished , Cat . N : 16141 - 079 ) 1 , 000 U / mL of LIF ( Millipore , Cat . N : ESG1106 ) , 0 . 1 mM of non - essential amino acids ( ThermoFished , Cat . N : 11140 - 035 ) , 1 mM of glutamax ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 35050 - 038 ) , 50U of penicillin and streptomycin ( ThermoFirsher , Cat . N : 15070 - 063 ) and 0 . 1 mM of 2 - mercaptoethanol ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 31350 - 010 ) . Media was changed every day and cells were passaged every two days using StemPro Accutase ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : A11105 - 01 ) . Cells were differentiated into neuronal progenitors and cortical neurons as described in ( Gaspard et . al . , 2008 ) with minor changes . In brief , cells were plated at low density ( 2 . 5x10 5 cells per plate ) on gelatin - coated 10cm dishes in ES media and after 12h cultured in DDM media ( DMEM / F12 + GlutaMAX ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 31331 - 028 ) , supplemented with 1x N2 ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 17502 - 048 ) , 1 mM of sodium pyruvate ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 11360 - 070 ) , 500 ug / ml BSA Fraction V ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 15260 - 037 ) , 0 . 1mM of 2 - mercaptoethanol and 50U of penicillin and streptomycin ) for a total of 12 days . Cyclopamine ( Merck – 239803 ) was added from day 2 to day 10 of differentiation . Media was changed every two days . After 12 days of differentiation , neural progenitors were dissociated using StemPro Accutase , plated on poly - lysine ( Sigma , Cat . N : P2636 ) / laminin ( Sigma , Cat . N : 11243217001 ) and cultured in 1 : 1 mixture of DDM and Neurobasal / N27 media ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 21103 - 049 , supplemented with 1x B27 without retinoic acid ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 12587 - 010 ) and 2mM GlutaMax ) for either additional 2 days ( D12 + 2 ) to obtain neural progenitors ( NPC ) , or additional 9 days ( D12 + 9 ) to obtain cortical neurons ( CNs ) . Generation of CRISPR - dCas9 Lines E14tg2a cells were infected by a lentivirus contain dCas9 - VP64 ( Addgene , Cat . N 61425 ) or empty dCas9 ( generating by removing the VP64 from the dCas9 - VP64 ) . Four days after infection cells were selected by adding 15ug / ml of basticidine ( GIBCO , Cat . N A11139 - 03 ) during one week . To generate dCas9 - VP64 / p65 - Hsf1 cell line , dCas9 - VP64 positive cells were then additionally infected by lenti - virus contain MS2 - P65 - HSF1 helper protein ( Addgene , Cat . N 61426 ) . Four days after infection positive cells were selected by adding hygromycine at 1mg / ml ( GIBCO , Cat . N 10687010 ) . Guide RNAs ( Zfp604 – AGAAAGCGGAATGAGAAGTT and Sox4 - TTGCTCTGTAAATTGGAATG ) were designed and cloned in lenti sgRNA ( MS2 ) zeo backbone ( Addgene , Cat . N 61427 ) according to Zhang lab protocol ( http : / / sam . genome - engineering . org / ) . The above mentioned CRISPR - dCas9 cell lines ( plus the original E14Tg2a cell line ) was infected by the sgRNA lentivirus and selected with 250ug / ml of zeocin ( Invitrogen Cat . N R250 - 01 ) for 5 days . The ﬁrst biological Hi - C / RNA replicate was collected one week after the original infection date , while the second was done one passage later ( 9 days post - infection ) . Mouse Strains Hes5 - GFP mice were a kind gift from Verdon Taylor . Dcx - mRFP ( C57BL / 6J - Tg ( Dcx - mRFP ) 15Qlu / J ) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory . The transgenic lines were housed and maintained following the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Commit - tee of the Institut National de la Sante´ et de la Recherche Me´dicale ( INSERM ) in accordance with the European Council directive ( 2010 / 63 / UE ) for the protection and use of vertebrate animals . To purify in vivo cortical progenitors and differentiating neurons , het - erozygous parents ( C57BL / 6J - Hes5 - GFP + / (cid:3) and C57BL / 6J - Dcx - mRFP + / (cid:3) ) were bred , at E14 . 5 embryos were harvested , examined using whole mount ﬂuorescence and the brains of double - positive ( GFP + / RFP + ) littermates were dissected . The somatosensory neocortex was placed in DMEM / F - 12 media , mechanically dissociated using P1000 tip and further incubated for 2 min with StemPro Accutase at 37C . 3x volume of DMEM / F12 was then added , cells were transferred to cold 1xPBS + 2 % FBS , and immediately pro - cessed for FACS . Each biological replicate represents a separate mating with 1 - 3 pooled littermates . METHOD DETAILS Cell Isolation and Puriﬁcation for HiC For the in vitro differentiation system , cells were dissociated using StemPro Accutase ( for ESs and NPCs ) or 0 . 05 % Trypsin - EDTA ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 25300 - 054 ) ( for CNs ) . After ﬁxation for 10 min at RT with freshly prepared 1 % formaldehyde in PBS ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 28908 ) , the reaction was quenched by adding 0 . 2M glycine solution for 5min . Cells were permeabilized using 0 . 1 % saponin and concentration was adjusted to 1x10 6 cells / mL PBS . 1 m L / mL of fxCycle far red dye ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : F10348 ) and 5 m L / mL RNase A ( 20mg / mL ) were added and samples were incubated for 30min at room temperature protected from light with slight agitation . After washing once with cold 1xPBS , samples were resuspended in cold 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS at a concentration Cell 171 , 557 – 572 . e1 – e8 , October 19 , 2017 e3 of (cid:2) 10 7 cells / mL and immediately processed for FACS . FACS was performed using BD FACSAria and appropriate gates were set based on the relative levels of GFP and fxCycle as described in Figure S1 in order to isolate GFP + / G 0 G 1 cells . For in vivo puriﬁed cells , between 250 000 and 600 000 cells per replicate were FACS - puriﬁed directly after dissociation and then immediately ﬁxed and quenched as described , as ﬁxation ﬁrst quenched mRFP signal completely ( data not shown ) . The appropriate gates to isolate GFP + / RFP - and RFP - / GFP + cells were set as described in Figure S7B . After FACS sorting , cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:3) 80C . HiC Library Preparation HiC and library preparation was carried out using the in situ method as described previously ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) with minor modiﬁca - tions . In order to maximize library complexity , FACS - puriﬁed samples were split into batches of 1x10 6 cells and processed sepa - rately . In brief , cells were digested overnight at 37C using 500U of DpnII . After biotin ﬁlling , proximity ligation was carried out for 4 hours at 18C with 2000U T4 DNA Ligase . After reverse - crosslinking , DNA was puriﬁed using ethanol precipitation and sheared to 300 - 400bp fragments using Covaris S220 sonicator . Ligation fragments containing biotin were immobilized on MyOne Streptavi - din T1 beads ( ThermoFished Cat . N : 65602 ) , end - repaired and a - tailed as described . NEXTﬂex adaptors ( Bioo Scientiﬁc , Cat . N : 514101 ) were then ligated and fragments were PCR ampliﬁed using KAPA HiFi Library Ampiﬁcation Kit ( Kapa Biosystems , Cat . N : KK2620 ) for 6 - 8 cycles . DNA was then double - size selected using AMPure XP beads ( Agencourt , Cat . N : A63881 ) in order to isolate fragments between 300 and 800bp . Strand - Speciﬁc Total RNA Library Preparation Cells were processed for FACS as described for HiC , except without ﬁxation , permeabilization or fxCycle addition . GFP + puriﬁed cells were immediately pelleted and resuspended in TRIzol ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 15596026 ) . After 5min at room temperature samples were vortexed for 20 s , 0 . 2x volumes of chloroform was added , tubes were mixed by inverting and samples were centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm at 4C for 15min . The aqueous phase was then processed using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAGEN , Cat . N : 74104 ) with DNase treatment , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Puriﬁed RNA ( maximum of 1ug ) was then used for library generation using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . ChIP and Library Preparation Cells were processed for FACS as described for HiC , except for permeabilization or fxCycle addition . GFP + puriﬁed cells were imme - diately pelleted , frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:3) 80C until further use . 1x10 6 cells per IP for chromatin marks , or 2 . 5x10 6 cells for CTCF / Ring1B were then thawed on ice , resuspended in cold cell lysis buffer ( 10mM Tris pH 8 , 10mM NaCl , 0 . 2 % NP - 40 ) + 1xEDTA - free Protease Inhibitors . 10mM sodium butyrate was added if H3K27ac was ChIPed . Cells were lysed for 20min , washed once with cold PBS and resuspended in 50ul per IP cold nuclei lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris pH8 , 10mM EDTA , 1 % SDS ) + 1xProtease Inhibitors / Sodium Butyrate . Nuclei were lysed for 10min at 4C with rotation and then sonicated for 16 - 18 cycles using Bioruptor ( Diagenode ) . After sonication , 5x volumes of IP dilution buffer ( 20mM Tris pH8 , 2mM EDTA , 150mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 01 % SDS + protease inhibitors ) was added , chromatin was precleared using 25ul Protein A dynabeads ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 10002D ) / 1mL for 1hrs at 4C with rotation . Meanwhile , 25ul beads / IP were washed once with cold 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS , and incubated with the antibody for 4 - 5hrs at 4C in 0 . 5ml 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS ) . Beads were then washed once with 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS , added to the precleared chromatin and incubated overnight at 4C with rotation . Beads were then washed once with cold IP wash buffer 1 ( 20mM Tris pH8 , 2mM EDTA , 50mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS ) , twice with high salt wash buffer ( 20mM Tris pH8 , 2mM EDTA , 500mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS ) , once with cold IP wash buffer 2 ( 10mM Tris pH8 , 1mM EDTA , 250mM LiCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate ) and twice with cold TE buffer ( 1mM Tris pH8 , 1mM EDTA ) . DNA : protein complexes were then eluted twice for 15min at 65C in 100ul elution buffer ( 100mM NaHCO 3 , 1 % SDS ) each time . 16ul 5M NaCl was then added and samples + inputs were reverse cross - linked at 65C , RNase A and proteinase K treated and puriﬁed using ultrapure phenol / chloroform ( ThermoFisher , Cat . N : 15593 - 049 ) . Libraries were prepared using Illumina’s TruSeq ChIP Sample Preparation Kit , according to the manufacturer’s instructions with two exceptions : libraries were PCR ampliﬁed using KAPA HiFi Library Ampiﬁcation Kit for 10 - 12 cycles to maximize complexity and the gel - based size - selection was performed after PCR ampliﬁcation . Library QC and Sequencing Before sequencing , libraries were quantiﬁed by qPCR and the size distribution was assessed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer / Caliper Labchip GX . Libraries were then sequenced 2x50bp paired - end run ( except some ChIP - seq libraries which were sequenced at 1x50bp single - end ) on the Illumina HiSeq2000 / HiSeq2500 platforms at the BGI Hong Kong facility . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ChIP - Seq Analysis Fastq ﬁles were aligned to the mm10 reference genome , PCR duplicates were removed using Samtools and normalized genome coverage tracks were generated from uniquely mapping reads ( mapq > 30 ) using deepTools2 . In order to avoid double counting for paired - end data , reads with mates were extended to match the fragment size deﬁned by the two read mates , and the second e4 Cell 171 , 557 – 572 . e1 – e8 , October 19 , 2017 read mate was discarded . Single - end reads , unmated reads , mate reads that map too far apart ( > 4x fragment length ) were extended by 200bp . Biological replicates were pooled and coverage was then calculated as average reads per million of mapped reads ( RPM ) in 10bp bins . To determine the peaks for ChIPs with narrow binding proﬁles ( CTCF , Ring1B , H3K4me3 , H3K27ac , Pax6 , NeuroD2 and Tbr1 ) , datasets were uniformly processed using the AQUAS Transcription Factor pipeline ( based off the Encode ( phase - 3 ) speciﬁcations ) with default parameters ( IDR = 5 % ) . Peaks for Nanog , ES _ H3K4me3 and ES _ H3K27ac were downloaded directly from the ENCODE website ( see Key Resources Table ) and used without modiﬁcations For broad histone marks , regions with strong signal enrichment ( > 98 % based on the global enrichment quantile using 1Kb bins ) were used . ChIP enrichment is then deﬁned as the – log2 ( 1 - global percentile rank ) . Differential peaks were detected using the R package Csaw . RNA - Seq Analysis Fastq ﬁles were aligned to the mm10 reference genome using STAR version 2 . 5 . 0a in basic twoPass mode using the ‘‘Encode’’ op - tions as speciﬁed in the manual . PCR duplicates were removed and RPM normalized strand - speciﬁc coverage tracks based on uniquely aligned reads were also produced using STAR in ‘‘inputAlignmentsFromBAM’’ runMode . Reads overlapping with annotated genes ( Ensembl build GRCm38 . p4 ) were counted using the summarizeOverlaps function from the R package ‘‘GenomicAlignments’’ in strand - speciﬁc , paired – end mode . FPKM ( Fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments ) counts and differential expres - sion was estimated using DESeq2 . Genes with FPKM > = 1 were considered expressed for subsequent analysis . Hi - C Sequence Alignment and QC Raw sequencing reads were mapped independently to the mm10 reference genome using Bowtie2 in local alignment mode . The uniquely mapped ( MAPQ > 36 ) reads were translated into a pair of fragment - ends ( fends ) by associating each read with its down - stream fend . PCR duplicates and reads mapping to the same restriction fragment were excluded . Library Statistics are presented in Table S1 and include total reads sequenced and number of valid interactions after ﬁltering . Contacts separated by less than 1kb were not considered for subsequent analysis , as the vast majority of this ultra - close cis contacts originate from non - di - gested DNA . Hi - C Data Processing In order to retain maximum information and utilize the depth of the generated data , all analysis has been performed at fragment end resolution with no binning unless otherwise stated . To generate an expected model , we shufﬂed the observed Hi - C contacts using the Shaman R package ( https : / / bitbucket . org / tanaylab / shaman ) with default parameters . Brieﬂy , cis - contacts were randomized us - ing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo - like approach per chromosome ( Olivares - Chauvet et al . , 2016 ) , such that the marginal coverage and contact distance distribution are preserved but any speciﬁc features , such as compartments , TADs or loops are not maintained . These expected HiC maps were generated for each biological replicate separately and contain twice the number of observed cis - contacts . We then calculated the score for each contact in the observed contact matrix using K nearest neighbors ( kNN ) strategy ( Olivares - Chauvet et al . , 2016 ) . In brief , the distributions of two - dimensional Euclidean distances between the observed contact and its nearest 200 neighbors in the pooled observed and pooled expected ( per cell type ) data are compared , using Kolmogorov – Smirnov D statistics to visualize positive ( higher density in observed data ) and negative ( lower density in observed data ) enrichments . These D - scores are then used for visualization ( (cid:3) 100 to + 100 scale ) and are referred to as HiC scores in the text . Contact Probability Contact probability as a function of the genomic distance was calculated as previously described ( Olivares - Chauvet et al . , 2016 ) . We calculated the distribution of the Hi - C contacts either as a log10 contact probability in log10 genomic distance bins , or in order to better visualize differences between conditions , as a simple contact probability ( sum of the observed counts per log2 bin , divided by the all of the observed contacts , without normalizing for the bin size ) . We measured the ‘‘contact probability scaling’’ exponent as the slope of the best - ﬁt line of the cis - decay curve when plotted on log - log axes , within a chosen range of distances . In addition to the genome - wide contact probability curves which were aggregated across individual chromosomes , we also gener - ated contact probability maps where we considered only contacts that are located completely within a TAD ( intra - TAD cis - decay curve ) or inter - TAD . For Figure S1L we also took into consideration whether the interaction is across compartments ( A - B or B - A ) or within a compartment ( A - A , B - B ) . Insulation , TAD , and TAD Boundary Calling To deﬁne insulation based on observed contacts we used the insulation score as previously deﬁned ( Nagano et al . , 2017 ; Olivares - Chauvet et al . , 2016 ) . The insulation score was computed individually on replicates and on the pooled contact map at 1Kb resolution within a region of ± 250Kb and is multiplied by ( (cid:3) 1 ) so that high insulation score represents strong insulation . In order to account for any genome - wide changes in the insulation score , we further normalized it by multiplying with a factor deﬁned as the average insu - lation score across all 1Kb genomic bins in each cell type , divided by the mean of all cell types . Domain boundaries were then deﬁned Cell 171 , 557 – 572 . e1 – e8 , October 19 , 2017 e5 as the local 2Kb maxima in regions , where the insulation score is above the 90 % quantile of the genome - wide distribution . Bound - aries within 10Kb of each other were merged and only boundaries , which were detected in at least 3 biological replicates , were retained . Domains shorter than 50Kb were discarded . To identify differential boundaries we pooled boundaries detected in the re - spected cell types , merging together boundaries if they were located within 10Kb . We consider borders as signiﬁcantly different if they fulﬁll the following criteria : 1 . boundary insulation score is signiﬁcantly different between cell types ( fdr < 0 . 01 using the Benjamini - Hochberg adjusted t test ) 2 . boundary variance ( deﬁned as the maximum insulation score – minimum insulation score across conditions ) . We consider the top 20 % based on variance , in order to avoid any potential false positives . 3 . crossing a boundary threshold – it is considered as a boundary in one condition but not in another ( as deﬁned above ) . Identiﬁcation of A and B Compartments TADs were assigned to either the A - or the B - compartment as described ( Nagano et al . , 2017 ) . In brief , we used k - means clustering ( K = 2 ) on the log2 ratio of observed and expected ( based on genomic length ) inter - TAD contacts in trans . Domains in each cluster exhibit distinct signature based on the enrichment of chromatin marks , replication timing and Lamin B1 DamID enrichment where available ( Figure S1I ) , prompting us to assign cluster 1 to the B - , inactive compartment and cluster 2 to the A - , active compartment . In order to identify compartment transitions , the number of TAD boundaries between adjacent domains of different types ( A - to - B or B - to - A transition ) was divided by the total number of TAD boundaries within that cell type . To determine the compartment strength , we calculated the log2 ratio of observed versus expected contacts ( intrachromosomal separated by at least 10Mb ) either between domains of the same ( A - A , B - B ) or different type ( A - B ) . As another measure of compartmentalization which relies on the intra - chromosomal contacts , we calculated the dominant eigen - vector of the contact matrices binned at 100Kb as described ( Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ) using scripts available at ( https : / / github . com / dekkerlab / cworld - dekker ) . Aggregate Insulation and Hi - C Maps To quantify the average insulation around a set of regions based on the Hi - C contacts , we merged adjacent regions if they were separated by less than 500bp and extracted the observed and the expected contacts in a ± 200Kb window . We calculated the number of contacts ( either observed or expected ) binned by 500bp and normalized them by the total number of contacts ( observed or expected respectively ) in the window . We then plotted the log2 ratio of the observed and the expected normalized counts . High insulation is thus characterized by lower log2 ( obs / exp ) ratio . Note than in Figure 4 the plots are oriented based on the strand of the gene . In order to calculate the average enrichment of contacts around genomic features ( for example ChIP - seq peaks ) , we ﬁrst merged adjacent peaks if they were separated by less than 1Kb , and constructed intrachromosomal pairs of intervals . For 5 0 to 3 0 gene anal - ysis ( Figure S5G ) matched pairs were used ( i . e . , belonging to the same gene ) . We then classiﬁed these pairs into IntraTAD pairs between 200Kb and 2Mb , inter - TAD pairs that cross TAD boundaries but are either at close - cis range ( from 200Kb to 2Mb ) , or alter - natively separated by long distance ( 2Mb to 10Mb ) – ‘‘long - range . ’’ We then extracted the observed and the expected contacts in a 40x40Kb window ( unless otherwise speciﬁed ) and processed them as described above . Strong contacts are characterized by a higher log2 ( obs / exp ) ratio . Note that for analysis involving enhancer - promoter interactions , we oriented the resulting plots based on the strand of the gene . In order to maximize resolution , we performed this analysis using the pooled data . To quantify the total enrichment of contacts over features , or as a function of the genomic distance between the pairs , we used cis - decay curves as described above , but only taking into account Hi - C contacts that fall within a 5Kb bins centered on the genomic features of interest ( adjacent peaks located less than this distance were merged ) . In order to estimate biological variability , we then calculated the log2 ratio of the observed and the expected contacts per replicate either for all intra - ( pairs are separated at least 10Kb and not more than 1Mb ) or inter - TAD ( pairs are between 1Mb and 100Mb ) cis - contacts , or as a function of the distance . Average TAD and Intra - or Inter - TAD Contact Enrichment To calculate the average TAD contact enrichment map , we extend each TAD interval ( with a length x ) both upstream and downstream by x . We then generated a 100x100 grid from the beginning until the end of the extended 2D interval . As each TAD has a different length the constructed grid had varying bin sizes . We then calculated log ratio of the observed and the expected contacts in each bin of the 100x100 grid per TAD . Figure 3A represents the mean values in each grid bin across all TADs per cell type . To calculate the log ratio of contacts outside of domains , we constructed two sets of 2D intervals . Upstream of the domain start ( start – domain length ) until the middle of the domain and downstream of the domain end ( end + domain length ) until the middle of the domain ( see Figure S4A for an illustration ) . The intervals were adjusted by 10 % in order to avoid overlapping with domain boundaries and the total number of the observed and expected contacts per TAD was extracted . e6 Cell 171 , 557 – 572 . e1 – e8 , October 19 , 2017 FISH We generated probes using PCR fragments of 1 . 1 to 1 . 7 kb ampliﬁed from mouse genomic DNA ( Table S4 ) . Probes were labeled using the FISH Tag DNA Kit with Alexa Fluor 488 , 555 , and 647 dyes ( Invitrogen life technologies ) . 3D FISH was adapted from ( Ban - tignies et al . , 2011 ) . Brieﬂy , E14Tg2a cells were differentiated as described above and ﬁxed overnight with 4 % PFA in PBS at 4C . Cells were treated with PBS , 0 . 5 % Triton for 10 minutes , washed in PBS , incubated with 0 . 1M HCl for 10 minutes , washed in 2XSSCT ( 2XSSC , 0 . 1 % Tween20 ) and incubated for 30 minutes in 50 % Formamide , 2XSCCT . 20 to 25 ng of each FISH probes were mixed with 4 m g ( for double FISH experiments ) or 5 m g ( for triple FISH experiments ) of Cot - 1 DNA ( Invitrogen life technologies , Cat No . 18440 - 016 ) and 0 . 8 m L of RNase A ( 10 mg / mL ) . This probe mixture was diluted in FISH hybridization buffer ( FHB : 50 % Formamide , 10 % Dextransulfat , 2XSSC , Salmon Sperm DNA 0 . 5 mg / mL ) always keeping at least three times more FHB buffer volume than probe mix volume ( for a total volume of approximately 20 - 25 m L ) . Probes were initially denatured at 80 (cid:4) C for 10 minutes , cooled in ice , and added to the coverslip before sealing ona slide with rubber cement . Cell DNA and probes wereco - denaturatedat 80 (cid:4) C for20 minutes and hybridization was performed at 42 (cid:4) C overnight in a humid dark chamber . Cells were then washed 3 3 5 minutes at 60 (cid:4) C in 2XSCCT , 3 3 5 minutes at 37 (cid:4) C in 2XSCC , 3 3 5 minutes at 45 (cid:4) C in 0 . 1XSCC , and 2 3 5 minutes in PBS before DNA counterstaining with DAPI ( ﬁnal concentration at 0 . 1ng / m L in PBS ) . After ﬁnal washing in PBS , coverslips were mounted on slides with Vectashield ( Clinisciences ) . Images were acquired using a Leica SP8 - UV microscope ( with a 63X / NA 1 . 4 oil immersion objective ) , Montpellier Rio Imaging ( MRI ) facility . Image analysis was performed with Imaris software ( Bitplane , Switzerland ) and its XT module . After the application of a Gaussian Filter ( sigma = 1 pixel ) , FISH signals were segmented in 3D and their center of mass were calculated . For double FISH ex - periments , the distances between closest neighbor’s center of mass were calculated ( with a maximum distance cut off set at 4 m m ) . For triple FISH experiments , the distances were calculated from one FISH center of mass to the two other FISH closest centers of mass ( with a maximum distance cut off set at 2 m m for both distances ) . Only FISH ﬂuorescence signals within DAPI 3D - segmented object were considered for the analysis . For nuclear mean radius calculation , DAPI channels of images were separated and projected along Z axis using average intensity , before analysis with Cell Proﬁler software . Objects were segmented using automatic thresholding strategy and the mean nuclear radius of the ES , NPC and CNs population were calculated ( ES = 1 . 73 ± 0 . 28 ; NPC = 1 . 39 ± 0 . 24 ; CN = 1 . 43 ± 0 . 20 ) . In order to control for the global change in nuclear size in Figures S4H and S4I , we normalized the pairwise FISH distances by multiplying by a cell - type speciﬁc factor , deﬁned as the mean nuclei radius in that cell type , divided by the average of all three cell types . We refer to these distances as normalized 3D distance . Identiﬁcation of Enhancers and Enhancer - Promoter Interactions To identify enhancers , we used H3K27ac peaks , ﬁltering out regions that were less than ± 5Kb away from known Tss . Peaks were merged if they were located less than 1Kb apart . The ratio between the maximum enrichment of H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 and H3K27ac to H3K4me3 in each putative enhancer region was calculated and only enhancers with H3K4me1 / H3K4me3 > 1 and H3K27ac / H3K4me3 > 1 were retained . Enhancers were also further subdivided into CTCF + versus CTCF - based on the presence of a CTCF binding site within ± 5Kb of the enhancer . In order to rule out the contribution of CTCF or promoter - promoter interactions when using average HiC maps , we removed regions , where there was another Tss in the window ( ± 20Kb ) , ﬁltered out promoters , where there was a CTCF binding site in the window , and oriented the resulting maps based on the direction of transcription . In order to calculate an Enhancer - Promoter ( EP ) interaction score , we constructed 5Kb pairs ( centered on the respective genomic feature ) between enhancers and promoters maximum 2Mb apart in a given cell type . We then extracted the maximum Hi - C interac - tion score in each cell type within that 5x5Kb window if it was supported by at least 10 contacts ( pooled data ) . For Table S3 , we report the Hi - C score between all ( Tss - ﬁltered only ) pairs of enhancer - promoters , supported by at least 10contacts and with a Hi - C score of > = 30 . To calculate the regional enrichment of enhancer - promoter interaction , for each pair we randomly permuted the enhancer anchor 250 times ( while keeping the Tss ) , requiring that the new position is inside the same TAD and that is at least ± 25Kb away from any known Tss or another enhancer . Comparing Enhancer - Promoter Interactions with Gene Expression To examine EP interaction on developmentally regulated genes , we selected genes that are expressed in at least one condition ( FPKM > 1 ) and have a fold change of at least 4 and clustered them using k - means ( k = 8 ) . We then selected only signiﬁcant EP pairs ( Hi - C score > 30 ) per gene in the cell type where the gene had maximum expression . For example , for the Nanog gene , we considered only the pool of ES enhancers when selecting E - P pairs . We then calculated the average gene expression per cluster ( mean ± SEM ) , the average EP interaction strength per cluster for the EP pairs as deﬁned above ( mean Hi - C score ± sem ) , and the correlation be - tween gene expression and EP interaction strength per gene . As control , we used the shufﬂed EP pairs as deﬁned above . To deter - mine the gene speciﬁcity score we used the method as described ( Javierre et al . , 2016 ) , but substituted the CHiCAGO score for the E - P Hi - C interaction score as deﬁned above . We calculated the gene speciﬁcity score separately based on expression data or HiC interaction score using the expression values or all E - P interaction Hi - C scores to construct the distance matrices .
