MUTATIONS AFFECTING SEXUAL CONJUGATION AND RELATED PROCESSES IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVZSZAE . I . ISOLATION AND PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERIZATION OF NONMATING MUTANTS ' 92 > 3 VIVIAN MACKAY4 AND THOMAS R . MANNEY Department of Microbiology , School of Medicine , Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland , Ohio 44206 and Department of Physics , Kansas State University , Manhattan , Kansas 66506 Manuscript received September 12 , 1973 ABSTRACT Nonmating mutants were also isolated from haploid strains of yeast of both mating types . The mutants were characterized with respect to their ability to produce and respond to specific yeast sex factors , their ability to mate at low frequencies , and the ability of the low - frequency diploids to sporulate . Loss of the ability to mate by either mating type was invariably accompanied by the loss of one or more , and in some cases , all , of the above capabilities . The re - sults strongly indicate that the sex factors are functionally involved in the conjugation process . HE mating - type locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is central to a complex Tcontrol system that coordinates functions in both the haplophase and diplo - phase of this simple eukaryotic organism . There are two alternative alleles , a and a ! , of the mating - type locus that confer the a and 01 mating types on haploid cells . In the diploid state , cells heterozygous for mating type ( a / a ) are unable to mate except rarely , although a / a and . / a ! cells mate with the same high frequency of haploids ( ROMAN and SANDS 1953 ; MORTIMER 1958 ) . In addition , a / a diploids have other properties that distinguish them from homozygous mating - type diploids , including ability to undergo meiosis and sporulation ( LINDEGREN and LINDGREN 1943 ; ROMAN and SANDS 1953 ; ROTH and LUSNAK 1970 ) , increased X - ray survival ( MORTIMER 1958 ) , and increased mitotic recombination after U V induction ( FRIIS and ROMAN 1968 ) . These alleles also control the process of conjugation ; the following model for conjugation , has been proposed ( BUCKING - THROM et al . 1973 ; HARTWELL 1973 ) . Cells of the a ! mating type constitutively produce a diffusible peptide a ! factor ( DUNTZE , MACKAY and MANNEY 1970 ; THROM and DUNTZE 1970 ; DUNTZE This work has been submitted in partial satisfaction of requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy . * This investigation was supported in part by Public Health Service Training Grant 5 - TO1 - GMoO171 , by a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship , and by National Institutes of Health grant GM19175 to T .

MANNEY et al . , 1973 ) that acts on a cells , arresting them in the cell division cycle as unbudded cells that have not initiated DNA synthesis ; the arrested cells undergo a morphological alteration to an asymmetrically elongated form . ( Cells with this elongated shape have been called “schmoos” by H . ROMAN , in reference to comic strip characters devised by AL CAPP ; this term will be used here for brevity . ) The existence of an analogous a factor was suggested by the occurrence of both a and Q schmoos in mating mixtures ( AHMAD 1953 ; LEVI 1956 ) . An a factor would act on cy cells in a manner analogous to that of Q factor . HARTWELL ( 1973 ) has shown that , in mixed cultures of a and Q cells , cells of both mating types accumulate as unbudded cells and that mating usually occurs between cells at this stage of the cell cycle . This state could be optimal for nuclear fusion , repli - cation , and meiosis without lethal mistakes . The structure of the mating - type locus itself is as yet unknown , although several observations indicate that it may be a complex site . HAWTHORNE ( 1963a ) obtained a mutant in which a lethal deletion extended into the mating - type locus . The cell was originally an a , but was mutated to a as a result of the deletion . Directed mutation of a to Q and 01 to a occurs by the action of homothallism genes described by several investigators ( HAWTHORNE 1963a , b ; TAKAHASHI 1958 , 1961 ; TAKAHASHI and IKEDA 1959 ; TAKANO and OSHIMA 1967 , 1970 ) . The a allele that results from a directed mutation of Q to a is indistinguishable pheno - typically and probably genetically from a alleles in heterothallic strains ( TAKANO and OSHIMA 1970 ) . Presumably , an Q allele resulting from mutation of a is like - wise identical to other QI alleles . To gain an understanding of the genetic elements involved in control of conju - gation and related processes we have isolated and analyzed a series of nonmating mutants of haploid strains . In this paper we describe their isolation , and pheno - typic characterization . We also present evidence for a diffusible sex factor pro - duced by cells of mating - type a and an assay method for demonstrating it . In the following paper we present a genetic analysis of the sterile mutants . The results of these experiments further implicate these sex factors in the mating process as part of a complex , multigene process under the control of the mating - type locus . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and nomenclature : The heterothallic strains of Saccharomyces cereuisiae used in this study were derived from strains obtained from R . K . MORTIMER of the University of Cali - fornia at Berkeley . The symbols and nomenclature are those proposed at the IVth and Vth Inter - national Yeast Genetics Conferences . The genotypes of the strains used are listed in Table 1 . Sterile mutants isolated in this study have been given the symbol ste . Because of the pro - cedure used , mutants from a single isolation experiment cannot be assumed to be independent . Therefore , each separate isolation was given a symbol ( VA , VB , etc . ) and all of its mutants were numbered . VA1 and VA2 are the first two mutants isolated in one experiment , VA ; VBl and VB2 are from the VB isolation , etc . Mutants with different isolation symbols are assumed to be independent . Media : The culture media used and their purposes are described below : YEPD : Difco Yeast Extract , 10 gramsfliter ; Difco Bacto - Peptone , 20 g / l ; dextrose , 20 g / l ; agar , 20g / l ( omitted in liquid medium ) ( ROMAN 1956 ) . YEPD is a rich complex medium used for a factor assays and mating , as well as for routine culturing and stock maintenance .

MANNEY SPOR : Potassium acetate , 9 . 65 g / l ; dextrose , 1 g / l ; yeast extract , 2 . 5 g / l ; agar , 20 g / l . SPOR is a modification of the sporulation medium described by MCCLARY , NULTY and MILLER ( 1959 ) . Zncubation conditions : All incubations were at 30 " unless the strains were temperature - sensitive , in which case , the permissive temperature was 23 " and the restrictive temperature 36 " ( HARTWELL 1967 ) . If liquid media were used , the flasks or tubes were agitated on a platform shaker for aeration . Assay for sex factors : The method used to assay the production of CY factor or the a cell re - sponse to it has been described previously ( DUNTZE , MACKAY and MANNEY 1970 ) . The method was modified slightly to assay a factor and the ( Y cell response to it . Cells of mating - type a were spread in a single streak on YEPD and incubated for 18 - 24 hours . Mating - type a : cells were streaked lightly next to and occasionally slightly into the a cells . After 5 hours ' incubation , a schmoos could be seen very close to the a streak . Often it was neces - sary to scan the length of the a streak to find areas with CY schmoos . Only when no schmoos were seen along the entire length of the streak was the test considered negative . This assay was not as sensitive as the CY factor assay , ahd there was some uncertainty in judging a mutant to be nega - tive . It should be emphasized that this assay was succcessful only on YEPD . Isolation of sterile mutants : The approach used was first suggested by D . C . HAWTHORNE _ . ~ - ( personal communication ) and has been described previously ( DUNTZE , MACKAY and MANNEY 1970 ) . The parent CY strain carried several nutritional markers and the recessive allele for resistance to canavanine , an analog of arginine . Cells from a 24 - hour culture were irradiated in water at a concentration of 2 x lo5 cells / ml with ultraviolet light from a germicidal lamp . Usually the dose was 374 ergs / mmZ , which yields approximately 86 % survival . The irradiated a : cells were immediately mixed with an equal volume of an Q cell suspension at 2 x I08 cells / ml ; 0 . 2 ml of this 1000 a : 1 a : mixture was spread on YEPD and incubated for 24 hours . The a strain used had the dominant allele for sensitivity to canavanine and nutritional markers complementary to those in the a : strain . The following would be typical strains , XT1172 - S245c CY ade6 his6 leu1 met1 trp5 gal2 can1 and S1388B a ade2 his2 lys5 thrl trp1 gal1 ga12 . After incubation , the cells were resuspended in water , diluted , and plated on an agar medium containing canavanine ( CAN ) and the nutritional requirements of the CY strain . Only unmated 01 cells could grow , although occasional diploids arose that had become homozygous for the can1 allele . The clones that survived this initial enrichment were further screened and classified as sterile mutants if they satisfied the following criteria : ( 1 ) nutritional phenotype of the 01 parent ; ( 2 ) inability to mate with test strains , scored by nutritional complementation , and visible zygote formation ; and ( 3 ) inability to sporulate . With this method the mutants isolated from a single culture are not necessarily independent . For this reason many independent isolations were conducted and a few mutants selected from each . These were assumed to be independent only if they were found to be phenotypically dif - ferent . The procedure for isolating sterile a mutants was slightly different from the above . The parent a strain was resistant to canavanine in this case , and the CY strain was sensitive . Incubation of irradiated cells for 7 - 8 hours , allowing the cells to undergo several divisions , was necessary for the mutations to be expressed . The a cells were then mixed with a cells and plated on YEPD for mating , as above . For temperature - sensitive mutant isolations , all steps of the procedure ( including pre - growth of the initial cultures ) were conducted at the restrictive temperature , 36 " . After completion of the isolation , the mutants were tested for their ability to mate at 23 " . Conditional mutants failed to mate at 36 " , but mated at 23 " . Mating of sterile mutants : Wild - type strains or mutants that are conditionally sterile ( i . e . , temperature - sensitive or suppressible ) were mated under the permissive condition by mixing with cells of the opposite mating type . After 3 hours , zygotes were isolated on agar slabs by ISOLATION OF NONMATING MUTANTS 259 micromanipulation and incubated until visible diploid colonies were formed ( HAWTHORNE and MORTIMER 1960 ) . Many of the unconditional sterile mutants were able to form diploids occasionally with normal haploids of the opposite mating type . These diploids were selected by prototroph selec - tion . Sporulufiom Diploid clones were transferred to YEPD agar for presporulation growth ; after 1 - 2 days , the colonies were replica - plated to SPOR and incubated for 3 - 4 days . Good sporulation was usually obtained by this method . Occasionally , the diploids were sporulated in liquid SPOR . Cells from pre - sporulation growth were inoculated at approximately 107 cells / ml and incubated for 3 - 4 days ; the cells were then washed once with water and resuspended in water . RESULTS Isolation of sterile mutants : The 393 sterile mutants obtained from 16 inde - pendent isolations are summarized in Table 2 . The mutant recovery frequency given is the number of mutants per canavanine - resistant colonies in the initial enrichment . It is primarily a measure of the efficiency of the enrichment step . Ultraviolet radiation ( UV ) was used as a mutagen at several different doses . Although greater UV exposure generally resulted in a greater frequency of mutants , subsequent genetic analysis failed to reveal appreciable variation in the classes of mutants obtained . The efficiency of the mutant recovery procedure appears to be quite sensitive to small variations in cell numbers and incubation times at various steps , Most of the variation in the mutant frequency can be attributed to these causes . Subsequent phenotypic and genetic analysis rules out the possibility that the variation is the result of clones of spontaneous mutants in some of the cultures . Because of these results and the low spontaneous frequency observed , we are confident that mutants from independent isolations are of inde - pendent origin . Sixty - six sterile a mutants , found in 20 independent isolations , are summarized in Table 3 . The same UV dose and parent strain were used for all of them . In the first 5 isolations , which yielded only 4 mutants , the irradiated a cells were not incubated before mating with the LY strain . In subsequent experiments , the irradi - ated cells were incubated before mating , resulting in more mutants , although a lower mutant frequency . This suggests that there is a phenotypic lag after muta - genesis , so potentially sterile a cells may be able to mate before the mutation is expressed . The last 10 isolations were done entirely at 36 " to isolate temperature - sensitive sterile mutants that could mate normally at the permissive temperature , 23 " . Ten of the 29 mutants mated even at 30 " at a frequency approaching that of wild - type strains , but were sterile at 36 " . The other 19 were sterile at 23 " , 30 " , and 36 " . Sex factor studies : Two of the functions related to the mating - type locus are the production of a mating - type - specific sex factor and the response to the sex factor of the opposite mating - type . The characteristic morphological change observed in a - cells responding to a - factor is shown in Figure 1 . The following observations were made on a number of different nonsterile a and LY strains . These have included most of the strains listed in Table 1 plus other laboratory stocks . The strains X2180 - 1A ( a ) and X2180 - 1B ( a ) were used as standards . 260 V . MACKAY AND T . R .

In Figure 2B , the heavy streak consisted of a cells and the light streak of a cells ; the latter did not exhibit any morphological changes or inhibition of division on SC . However , the existence of a factor was demonstrated on YEPD , as illus - trated by Figure 3A in which the heavy a streak was XT1177 - S47c , the parent of the sterile a mutants . The a - cells close to the a streak have undergone a mor - phological change to the elongated schmoo shape ; some inhibiton of division can be seen , but generally results of the a - factor assay were much less pronounced than those of the a - factor test .

Of 383 mutants , 196 have lost the capacity to produce any detectable quantity of the active substance .

The mutants may make either smaller amounts or an altered form of the factor , but the limitations of the assay method used prohibit any reliable quantitation , so these strains were not classified separately from the other a - factor positive mutants .

The results for the mutants isolated at 30 " are summarized in Table 5 , part A . Only 5 of the 37 elicited any response in the a test strain ; in 4 of the 5 , the a - call reaction was less than with wild - type a strains . VY5 alone appeared to produce as strong a response as wild - type a cells . The a - factor assay for VY5 is shown in Figure 3B . W5 - derived spores that are a ste also caused a pronounced schmoo response in a cells , as illustrated in Figure 3C . Figure 3D demonstrates the lack of a - cell response produced by another a ste mutant . As shown in the third column of Table 5 , part A , none of the VR - VY mutants responded to a factor , as scored by schmoo formation or inhibition of cell division . The mutants isolated at 36O to obtain temperature - sensitive sterile mutants were also tested at 36 " and 23 " , as shown in Table 5 , part B . Only two ( VAB2 and VAI2 ) of the 29 produced detectable a factor at 36 " , while ten gave definite positive results at 23 " . Four mutants ( VZ3 , VABl , VAE3 , and VAE5 ) caused questionable responses at 23 " ; a few a schmoos were seen , but the vast majority of the a cells close to the mutant streak were unaffected . None of the a mutants responded to a factor at 36 " . Nine formed schmoos when tested at 23 " , and 6 of these also made a factor at 23O , but not at 36 " . Not all of the mutants that are able to mate at 23 " , however , had normal sex - factor phenotypes at that temper - ature . 266 V . MACKAY AND T . R . MANNEY Low - frequency matings : In order to study these sterile mutations genetically , it was necessary to mate the mutants with wild - type strains to form diploids that could be analyzed . Temperature - sensitive sterile mutants could be mated directly with cells of the opposite mating type at the permissive temperature , and zygotes isolated by micromanipulation . However , most of the sterile strains are uncon - ditional . Although they do not mate at frequencies that allow them to be detected by the usual complementation tests , with some of the mutants low - frequency matings ( LFM ) could be detected by prototroph selection . These mutants formed discrete colonies under conditions where their parent strains would produce confluent growth on the media selective Tor diploids . The genetic analysis described in the following paper revealed that diploids rarely resulted from reversion of the sterile mutation . Since there are many sterile a : mutants and since their independence within a mutant series is not certain , only representative mutants were tested for low - frequency mating ( LFM ) . The results are shown in Table 6 . A high percentage of the mutants ( 62 . 5 % ) possesses the ability to mate to some degree with a cells ( whatever the mechanism ) . The low - frequency maters and nonmaters were also classified for their capacities to produce a factor .

ISOLATION OF NONMATING MUTANTS 26 7 45 % can mate at low hequency , compared with 86 % of the a - factor - negative mutants . Thus , the ability of sterile a : strains to mate at low frequency is not dependent on the production of detectable quantities of a factor . All of the sterile a mutants were tested for low - frequency mating ability . Table 7 summarizes the data by mutant series and a - factor production . The percentage of a mutants that mated at low frequency ( 60 . 6 % ) is comparable to that found with the ( II mutants ( 62 . 5 % ) . There is no apparent correlation between the ability to produce a factor and the ability to mate with a cells at low fre - quency . Although low - frequency mating studies may provide information about the phenotypes conferred by the mutations , they were conducted primarily to obtain diploids for genetic analysis . For this reason , a simpler technique was used for the VZ through VAI mutants , The overnight YEPD culture of the a ste strain TABLE 7 Low - frequency mating of a ste mutants with wild - type Q strains % - factor + % - factor - Total Mutant series LFM + LFM - L FM + LFH - LFM + 1 FM - VT vs VT vu vv vw vx VY vz VAA VAB VAC VAD VAE VAF VAG VAH VA I 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 3 0 2 4 3 1 2 2 5 4 1 2 1 0 0 0 4 2 7 2 6 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 5 2 2 4 7 0 3 3 7 4 0 3 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 5 2 4 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 LFM = low - frequency mating . 268 V . MACKAY AND T . R . MANNEY was mixed directly with an equal volume of the a culture . So instead of the lo8 a : lo5 a ste ratio used before , the proportions were approximately IO8 a : IOs a ste . The mating plates were incubated at 30° , and under these semipermissive conditions , only two mutants , VAE2 and VAES , failed to yield any diploid clones . Ten of the mutants were temperature - sensitive ( Table 5 , part B ) , giving con - fluent growth on the selective plates . At 23 " , these strains were able to form numerous visible zygotes with cr cells . Sporulation of diploids heterozygous for sterile mutations : The diploids formed from low - frequency matings of sterile mutants with standard strains were tested for their ability to sporulate . Seven of the a mutants and six of the a mutants formed diploids that would not produce discernible asci as scored by microscopic observation . This inability to sporulate was a reproducible feature of these particular mutants , although occasionally some of them would form diploids that would sporulate ( Table 8 ) . When these asci were dissected they were always found to contain 2 a spores and 2 cz spores . When the nonsporulating diploids were tested for mating with normally mating haploids they were found to mate at normal ( wild - type ) frequencies , and to have the mating - type opposite to that of the parent strain of the mutant ( Table 8 ) . As none of these mutants produce sex factors , the mutations apparently eliminate all the function of the mating - type locus , including its function related to sporulation of a / a diploids ; these diploids behave as though they carry only one functional mating - type allele , the TABLE 8 Mutations that affect sporulation Clones Diploids that Asci Mating type Mating type Mutant tested sporulated dissected of mutant of diploid VT2 VAEl VAE3 VAE4 VAE6 VAFl VAF2 vc45 vc73 vc77 VL2 VP2 VQ6 1 48 16 48 48 48 4 32 13 17 7 3 32 0 7 2 2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 - 11 33 35 17 13 29 - a a a a a a a a a a a a a - * a a a a - * a a a a a a - * * Not tested . ISOLATION OF NONMATING MUTANTS 269 one from the test strain to which the mutant was mated . The occasional sporu - lating diploids formed by these mutants behave as though they have reverted , giving normal segregation for mating type . If the cultures of these mutants con - tain a low frequency of revertants they would be selected with high efficiency in the low - frequency mating procedure . Occasional diploids derived from the mating of the other sterile mutants with wild - type cells are all capable of sporulating . Thus , they retain the mating - type - determined functions necessary for sporulation and meiosis . DISCUSSION In this paper we have described the isolation and phenotypic properties of haploid mutants that cannot mate with cells of the opposite mating type . In addition , with the use of the sterile a mutants , we have demonstrated the exist - ence of a diffusible sex factor produced by a cells . This substance may affect ( Y cells in a manner analogous to the action of ( Y factor on a cells , since , in a mixture of a and 01 cells , unbudded cells and schmoos of both mating types accumulate ( LEVI 1956 ; HARTWELL 1973 ) . Many of the sterile mutants isolated from either mating type have simultaneously lost the capacity to produce detect - able amounts of their specific sex factor . That the effect is caused by single gene mutations has been demonstrated by the genetic analysis described in the follow - ing paper ( MACKAY and MANNEY 1974 ) . These results strongly indicate that the sex factors are functionally involved in the conjugation process . SENA , RADIN and FOGEL ( 1 973 ) have recently reported that addition of a crude preparation of CY factor to a mating mixture actually hindered the agglutination reaction prerequisite to conjugation . However , the concentration of a factor used ( sufficient to evoke the schmoo response ) is probably considerably higher than the level of sex factors in a normal mating mixture , and exogenous a factor was not added . We do not feel that this observation contradicts the conclusion that these sex factors play an essential role in conjugation . Therefore , the mating inhibition that they observed may result from such an unbalanced condition . The mutant isolation procedure used in this investigation requires that a mutant be able to survive the mating process to be recovered . Thus , the sterile mutations studied probably affect only a portion of the conjugation process . For example , defects that allow formation of inviable zygotes would never be isolated . Such mutants might fuse with cells of the opposite mating type , but processes leading to diploid zygotes capable of budding off diploid cells would be blocked . Another class of mutants selected against are those that respond to the sex factor of the opposite mating type . In the isolation procedure , a sterile a cell , for example , is surrounded by a 1000 - fold excess of wild - type ( Y cells that produce 01 factor . If If the a mutant is sensitive to a factor , it will be inhibited by the factor , while the other cells in the mating mixture ( a cells , a / . diploids , and sterile a cells that do not respond to ( Y factor ) will continue to grow . Therefore , the chance of obtaining such a mutant after resuspension and dilution of the mating mixture is reduced . The same situation could exist for 01 mutants able to respond to a factor . The one ( Y mutant that does respond to a factor proves that such cells can exist . It is possible 2 70 V . MACKAY AND T . R . MANNEY that for each class of mutants represented in this investigation there is a parallel class of sterile strains that can respond to sex factors . In spite of a possible selective bias , the sterile mutants that we have isolated possess several different phenotypes . The potential of mutants to mate at low frequency and the sporulation and mating properties of the diploids thus formed , as well as the mutants’ sex factor abilities , suggest that several genes may be operative in conjugation . It is of some interest that we did not recover any mutations from a to CY or from ( Y to a . We see no obvious reason why our procedures would not have recovered them , and therefore conclude that they must occur at somewhat lower frequencies than sterile mutants . In the following paper , genetic analysis of the low - frequency diploids will be presented . From these results and the phenotypic properties of the sterile mutants described in this paper , it has been possible to infer some of the general features of the mating - type control system . his laboratory and for his excellent criticism of our manuscript .
