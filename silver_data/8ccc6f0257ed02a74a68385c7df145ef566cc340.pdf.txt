We aimed to characterize the household transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syn - drome Coronavirus ( SARS CoV - 2 ) and its associated risk factors . Methods This prospective case - ascertained study was conducted among the household contacts of laboratory - confirmed SARS CoV - 2 cases residing in Ballabgarh , Haryana . We enrolled 148 index cases and their 645 household contacts between December 16 , 2020 and June 24 , 2021 . We defined household contact as any person who had resided in the same household as a confirmed COVID - 19 case . Baseline data collection and sample collection for real time - reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) and IgM / IgG against SARS CoV - 2 were done on day 1 visit , and followed for a period of 28 days . RT - PCR was repeated on day 14 or whenever the contact is symptomatic and blood sample for serology was repeated on day 28 . We estimated household secondary infection rate ( SIR ) and other epi - demiological indicators – median incubation period and serial interval . We employed binomial logistic regression to quantify risk factors associated with infection . Results The household SIR was 30 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 27 . 1 – 34 . 1 % ) . The secondary clinical attack rate was 9 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 7 . 2 – 11 . 8 ) . The risk factors that showed higher susceptibility to infection were household contacts who were the primary care giver of the case , whose index cases PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0287048 October 5 , 2023 1 / 14 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : YadavK , K .

The median ( IQR ) incubation period was 4 days ( 4 , 5 ) , mean ( SD ) serial interval 6 . 4 ( ± 2 . 2 ) days , and median ( IQR ) serial interval 5 days ( 5 , 7 ) . Conclusion Households favour secondary transmission of SARS CoV - 2 , hence , index cases are rec - ommended to self - isolate and wear masks ; and household contacts to follow strict COVID infection control measures within households when a family member is infected . Introduction The Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) spreads via direct and / or indirect contact with the infected peo - ple [ 1 ] . With an alarming increase in the number of cases reported globally , World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared COVID 19 as a pandemic on 11 th March , 2021 [ 2 ] . The num - ber of COVID cases continued to escalate , reporting more than 750 million cases globally ( 7 th March , 2023 ) . India stood second in the highest number of cases reported after USA [ 3 ] . SARS CoV - 2 is a novel virus with continuously evolving transmission trends . The detec - tion and spread of such novel virus are accompanied by uncertainty over the key epidemiologi - cal , clinical and virological characteristics and dynamics of the disease transmission [ 4 ] . Crowded indoor environments with sustained close contacts such as households , are a particu - larly high - risk setting for disease transmission [ 1 ] . The advantage of choosing households is that they have a defined population that may not mix readily with the larger surrounding com - munity . Therefore such settings can provide a strategic way to characterize virus transmission patterns because the denominator is often well defined . Also , exposure is within the setting , and follow - up of household contacts is generally more feasible in this well - defined setting than in an undefined one [ 4 ] . In low and middle - income countries ( LMICs ) , where a quality health - care service for the entire population has been a challenge , overcrowding and inadequate hous - ing per person can enhance the risk of transmission among close contacts in households [ 5 ] . The disease transmissibility can be characterized by household Secondary Attack Rate ( SAR ) [ 1 ] . In epidemiology , a household secondary attack rate is defined as number of house - hold cases occurring within the incubation period upon exposure to a primary case divided by total susceptible household contacts [ 6 ] . This indicator will help in studying and understand - ing the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and also provide information regarding how social interactions influence transmission risk [ 7 ] . To date , the transmissibility of the disease has primarily been assessed at the population level , using mathematical models , or at the individual level in synthetic populations using agent - based models coupled with statistical methods to capture the current evidence [ 8 ] . Liter - ature shows that secondary transmission or infection of SARS - CoV - 2 in household contacts ranges from 4 . 6 % to 49 . 6 % [ 1 , 6 , 9 – 11 ] . In India , transmissibility within households or close contacts remains under investigated . Only few studies have been conducted so far . A study by Laxminarayan et al . [ 12 ] in two south Indian states viz . Tamilnadu and Andhra Pradesh , reported that the per - contact risk of infection was 9 . 0 % ( 7 . 5 – 10 . 5 % ) in the household . PLOS ONE Householdtransmission investigation of COVID - 19 PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0287048 October 5 , 2023 2 / 14 Funding : This work was supported by fund from World Health Organization . The funders had no role in data collection and analysisor preparation of the manuscript . Priorapproval for publicationwas sought fromthe funders and the study was conducted in accordance with the WHO Unity Protocol 2020 - Householdtransmission investigation protocolfor coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterestsexist . However , it was based on the assumptions of robust contact tracing and not entirely a house - hold transmission study . In accordance with the WHO Unity protocol 2020 on household transmission of COVID 19 [ 4 ] , this study was undertaken with the objectives of estimating the secondary infection rate and secondary clinical attack rate for household contacts and factors associated with any varia - tion in the secondary infection risk and to provide suggestions for possible public health measures . Methods We conducted a prospective case - ascertained study of all identified household contacts of a RT - PCR confirmed SARS CoV - 2 cases in the intensive field practice area of the Comprehen - sive Rural Health Services Project ( CRHSP ) , AIIMS in Ballabgarh block of district Faridabad , Haryana . Faridabad district stood second with the highest number of COVID cases in Haryana with a case positivity rate of 5 . 8 % at the start of the study and it further increased to 12 . 24 % during the second wave of COVID - 19 ( April 2021 ) . The intensive field practice area caters to around 1 . 0 lakh population in rural area and around 2 . 5 lakhs population in urban area of Ballabgarh . We included the households of RT - PCR confirmed COVID - 19 cases and their contacts irrespective of age and gender and who consented for the study , and excluded those house - holds in which the date of symptom onset of COVID - 19 was same for more than one family member ( co - primary cases ) , all household members who tested positive on day 1 visit and who were serologically positive on day 1 , hospitalized cases and their contacts , and children less than one - year old and those households who did not consent for the study . The first household was enrolled on 16 th December 2020 , the last one was on 28 th May 2021 and the final follow - up date was 24 th June 2021 . The Delta variant ( or B . 1 . 617 . 2 strain ) of the coronavi - rus was the dominant strain at the time of the study . Sample size The secondary attack rate as reported by Laxminarayan et al . [ 12 ] using contact tracing data was around 9 – 10 % . Since household SAR would likely be higher , we took it like 15 % with 20 % relative precision . With a 10 % non - response rate , the sample size was calculated as 623 . Assuming the average household size in Ballabgarh , Faridabad as 5 , a minimum of 125 house - holds with a laboratory confirmed SARS CoV - 2 index case were required ( i . e . , 125 laboratory confirmed cases and their 500 household contacts ) . In this study , 179 households with 757 household contacts were interviewed . Considering the exclusion criteria , 31 households and their 112 contacts were excluded . Thus 148 households and their 645 contacts were finally enrolled in this study . This study was conducted in accordance with the WHO Unity Protocol 2020 - Household transmission investigation protocol for coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) [ 4 ] . Operational definitions [ 4 ] Confirmed case of COVID 19 : A person with laboratory confirmation of SARS CoV - 2 infec - tion . Household : a group of people ( two or more ) living in the same residence . Household contact : any person who has resided in the same household as a confirmed COVID - 19 case . Secondary clinical attack rate : A measure of the frequency of new symptomatic cases of COVID - 19 infection that occur among contacts within the incubation period ( 14 days ) follow - ing exposure to a primary confirmed case , in relation to the total number of exposed suscepti - ble ( who lacks resistance to a disease and at risk of becoming infected by a disease ) contacts . PLOS ONE Householdtransmission investigation of COVID - 19 PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0287048 October 5 , 2023 3 / 14 Secondary infection rate ( SIR ) : A measure of the frequency of new infections of COVID - 19 among contacts within the incubation period ( 14 days ) following exposure to a primary con - firmed case , in relation to the total number of exposed susceptible contacts . ( The rate of con - tacts being infected , assessed through serological assays / RT PCR ) . Incubation period : The period between an exposure resulting in SARS CoV - 2 infection and the appearance of the first sign or symptom of the disease . Serial Interval : The period from the onset of symptoms in the primary case to the onset of symptoms in a contact . Severity of the COVID : Mild—Cases with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection with fever , cough , sore throat , nasal conges - tion , malaise , headache without evidence of breathlessness or Hypoxia ( normal saturation ) . Moderate—Pneumonia with no signs of severe disease with the presence of clinical features of dyspnoea and or hypoxia , fever , cough , including SpO2 < 94 % ( range 90 – 94 % ) on room air , Respiratory Rate more or equal to 24 per minute . Severe—Severe pneumonia plus one of the following ; respiratory rate > 30 breaths / min , severe respiratory distress , SpO2 < 90 % on room air [ 13 ] . Overcrowding : It is assessed using the persons per room criterion . The number of persons in the household is divided by the number of rooms in the house . One room - 2 per - sons ; two rooms—three persons ; three rooms – 5 persons ; four rooms – seven persons ; five rooms – ten persons ; more than five rooms – add two persons for each additional room [ 14 ] . Data collection method The list of RT – PCR confirmed index COVID cases were obtained from the Haryana Govern - ment’s COVID 19 portal and also through the Senior Medical Officers of the field practice area of Ballabgarh . The health care workers informed the index cases about their disease status , and all of their household contacts were quarantined in their houses immediately for 14 days . The included index cases were communicated telephonically to confirm their availability for a face - to - face interview . The enrolled index cases and their household contacts were paid four home visits , including the enrolment visit ( Day 1 ) and three follow - up visits ( Day 7 , 14 and Day 28 ) within 28 days of enrolment . Data collecting tools Questionnaire . Consenting individuals answered the questionnaire adapted from the WHO household transmission investigation protocol [ 4 ] . It covered demographic informa - tion , relationship with the known index case , exposure attributes during contact with the case or cases during the defined time interval and previous medical history . The date of onset and type of clinical symptoms experienced by the subject ( even if presented individually ) , were also recorded . The questionnaire assessed the symptoms specifically suggestive of COVID 19 , and other symptoms also . Data collection was done using Epicollect 5 mobile and web based application . Sample collection . All baseline upper respiratory tract specimens ( nasopharyngeal / oro - pharyngeal swab ) for RT - PCR and blood samples for serology were collected at the initial home visit ( Day 1 ) from all household contacts , regardless of symptoms . The contacts were fol - lowed up and nasopharyngeal / oropharyngeal swab was collected whenever the contacts showed any symptoms of COVID 19 . If otherwise , a nasopharyngeal / oropharyngeal swab was collected on day 14 from all household contacts , for virological testing , regardless of symp - toms . And at the day 28 visit , a blood sample was collected from all household contacts for Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) . RT - PCR , the gold standard technique was employed for virological diagnosis of SARS CoV - 2 . And ELISA was performed using the WANTAI Kit ( Beijing Wantai Biological Phar - macy Enterprise Co . , Ltd , China ) for serological testing . WANTAI SARS - CoV - 2 Antibody PLOS ONE Householdtransmission investigation of COVID - 19 PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0287048 October 5 , 2023 4 / 14 ELISA is for the qualitative detection of total antibody ( including IgM and IgG ) to SARS - CoV - 2 in serum samples with a sensitivity of 94 . 4 % and specificity of 100 % [ 15 ] . All those involved in collecting and transporting specimens were trained in safe handling practices and spill decontamination procedures . For each biological sample collected , the time of collection , the conditions for transportation , and the time of arrival at the study laboratory were recorded . Nasopharyngeal / oropharyngeal specimens were transported to the Laboratory Medicine , AIIMS , New Delhi within 48 hours of collection , maintaining the cold chain . Serum was separated from whole blood and stored in Ballabgarh laboratory and shipped at 2 – 8˚C . The results of the tests were communicated to the study participants . Ethical considerations AIIMS Ethics Committee clearance was obtained and the guidelines about the participant information sheet ( PIS ) and Participant informed consent form ( PICF ) were followed . Permis - sion from the Medical officers of the respective areas was obtained before the start of the study . The purpose of the investigation was explained to all the household contacts of the index cases in the local language ( Hindi ) . Written informed consent was obtained from each study partici - pant willing to participate in the study . For 1 – 11 years - parents’ consent was taken , for 12 – 18 years parent’s consent and participant’s assent , and for more than 18 years participant’s con - sent was taken . Statistical analysis Epicollect 5 and Microsoft Excel were used for data management . Data analyses were con - ducted using Stata 16 ( Stata Corp , Texas ) . Descriptive statistics were employed . Continuous variables were expressed as mean ( standard deviation ) and median ( interquartile ranges ) , and categorical variables as percentages ( % ) . SIR was calculated by dividing number of secondary cases by the total exposed susceptible contacts ; Secondary clinical attack rate by dividing the number of only symptomatic secondary cases by the total exposed susceptible contacts . We calculated individual Secondary Infection Rate for univariate analyses of case and household factors , to examine transmission risk . To explore the risk factors associated with COVID - 19 among household contacts , a binomial regression model and post - estimation method were used . Results We contacted 179 households with 757 household contacts during the study period . Out of which , 31 households with index case and their 112 contacts were excluded , applying the exclusion criteria . The remaining 148 households and their 645 contacts were eligible to be included in the study . The follow up rate for the three subsequent visits were 93 . 8 % , 100 % , 91 . 3 % and 83 . 6 % respectively . The demographic and baseline characteristics of the participants are described in Table 1 . Of the 645 household contacts , 197 contacts ( 30 . 5 % ) became secondary cases . The median ( IQR ) age of the index cases was 39 years ( 28 , 53 ) and that of the secondary cases was 30 years ( 17 , 52 ) . The majority of the index cases ( 67 . 6 % ) and secondary cases ( 52 . 3 % ) were in the age group of 20 – 59 years . Among the index cases , 56 . 1 % were symptomatic . Majority ( 69 . 5 % ) of the secondary cases were asymptomatic . The 148 index cases gave rise to 197 secondary cases among 645 household contacts . Hence the secondary infection rate was 30 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 27 . 1 – 34 . 1 ) . Among 197 secondary cases , 82 ( 41 . 6 % ) were identified through RT PCR and 115 ( 58 . 4 % ) were identified by serology on day 28 ( ELISA positive and RT PCR negative ) .

The secondary clinical attack rate was 9 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 7 . 2 – 11 . 8 ) . We estimated the median ( IQR ) incubation period of SARS CoV - 2 was 4 days ( 4 , 5 ) . The mean ( SD ) serial interval was 6 . 4 ( ± 2 . 2 ) days and the median ( IQR ) serial interval was 5 days ( 5 , 7 ) . The hospitalization rate among index cases was 2 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 7 – 5 . 4 ) and that of secondary cases was 2 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 0 – 4 . 0 ) . The infec - tion fatality rate among index cases was 2 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 0 – 4 . 7 ) . There were no fatalities among secondary cases . The factors significantly associated with SIR in the univariate analysis included household contacts , those who were the primary care giver of the case , those who were with underlying medical conditions , overcrowded households , those whose index cases were symptomatic , those who were sharing toilet with the index cases , those who had physical contact with index cases and those who were not wearing a mask when coming in contact with the case ( Table 2 ) . The significant factors ( p < 0 . 05 ) in univariate analysis were run through binomial regres - sion model to identify the independent risk factors associated with secondary infection within households . After adjusting for other risk factors , the adjusted OR were as follows : household contacts who were the primary care giver of the case ( OR = 1 . 60 [ 95 % CI : 1 . 42 – 2 . 85 ] ) , who were with underlying medical conditions ( OR = 1 . 83 [ 95 % CI : 1 . 09 – 3 . 05 ] ) , overcrowded households ( OR = 1 . 43 [ 95 % CI : 1 . 13 – 2 . 26 ] ) , whose index cases were mildly symptomatic ( OR = 1 . 44 [ 95 % CI : 1 . 09 – 2 . 09 ] ) and moderately / severely symptomatic ( OR = 1 . 48 [ 95 % CI : 1 . 26 – 1 . 89 ] ) , who were sharing toilet with the index cases ( OR = 1 . 82 [ 95 % CI : 1 . 29 – 2 . 93 ] ) remained significantly associated with increased risk for COVID 19 as independent risk fac - tors . Also who were wearing a mask when coming in contact with the case ( OR = 0 . 86 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 56 – 0 . 93 ] ) was significantly associated with decreased risk for COVID 19 ( Table 3 ) . Discussion Households offer an ideal setting for assessing the infectivity and transmissibility of SARS - - CoV - 2 and its associated risk factors [ 1 ] . To assess this , we conducted a prospective case - ascertained study of identified household contacts of a RT - PCR confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Ballabgarh , Haryana . The secondary infection rate ( SIR ) was 30 . 5 % and secondary clinical attack rate was 9 . 3 % . The risk factors associated with secondary transmission of COVID - 19 were the household contacts who were the primary care giver of the case , who were with underlying medical conditions , overcrowded households , whose index cases were Table 1 .

However our estimate was lower when compared with that of Tennessee and Wisconsin of USA ( 53 % ) [ 17 ] . Majority of the studies reported lower estimates of secondary infection in the range of 4 . 6 % – 23 . 0 % in various provinces of China and USA [ 10 , 16 ] . The pooled esti - mates of SIR from meta - analysis studies also were also lower as 16 . 6 % - 18 . 1 % [ 1 , 22 , 23 ] with significant heterogeneity across the studies ranging from 3 . 9 % to 54 . 9 % [ 23 ] . The difference in secondary infection rates between our study and others published may have been due to various reasons including approaches of identifying or defining secondary cases , features of the cases investigated , environmental and behavioural differences , control measures of that geographical area for mitigating the disease spread and more importantly the study design [ 9 , 22 ] . The published studies were a combination of both retrospective and pro - spective study designs , with the former comprising most of them . As expected , studies with increased frequency of testing regardless of symptom status and longer follow up of the con - tacts would generally report higher infection rates [ 18 ] . Several studies have reported lower estimates of household transmission , mainly from contact tracing activities , with limited fol - low - up and testing of household contacts or delayed enrolment relative to index patient identi - fication [ 17 ] . Our study was a prospective one with longer follow - up ( 28 days ) , including weekly RT - PCR testing up to 14 days , combined with antibody testing at day 28 . Therefore , the chance of higher secondary infection rates relative to other studies is probable . Studies con - ducted similarly also reported higher SIR as in North Carolina ( 32 % ) [ 18 ] , Utah and Wiscon - sin provinces ( 29 % ) [ 20 ] , and Tenesse and Wisconsin of USA ( 53 % ) [ 17 ] which were prospective and also included serological testing for antibody detection . However , the possibil - ity of secondary cases identified later during follow - up acquired from the community other than the index cases cannot be ruled out . The actual SIR may be likely lower than that observed in our study . Nonetheless , the still high household SIR observed in our study underscores the need for effective control measures for SARS - CoV - 2 within households . In this study , the secondary clinical attack rate was 9 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 7 . 2 – 11 . 8 % ) . This study’s secondary clinical attack rate is much higher when compared to a study done in Kerala , India ( 2 . 6 % ) and in Singapore ( 5 . 9 % ) [ 7 , 24 ] . This higher rate may be attributed because the studies were cross - sectional or retrospective . In this study , we estimated that the median ( IQR ) incubation period of COVID - 19 was 4 days ( 4 , 5 ) . This is in line with the estimate reported in 30 provinces of China ( 4 days ) [ 26 ] and Zhuhai , China ( 4 . 3 days ) [ 9 ] and slightly lower than those reported outside of Wuhan ( 5 . 1 days ) [ 27 ] and in Wuhan ( 5 . 2 days ) [ 28 ] . Meta - analysis across various regions revealed an estimate between 4 . 0 to 9 . 0 days [ 29 , 30 ] . Similarly , the median ( IQR ) serial interval calculated in our study was 5 days ( 5 , 7 ) which is in line with the estimate reported in Zhuhai , China ( 5 . 1 days ) [ 9 ] and slightly higher than those reported in mainland China ( 4 . 6 days ) [ 25 ] . Serial interval across various regions of the world revealed an estimate between 4 . 0 to 8 . 0 days [ 25 , 29 , 30 ] . The incu - bation period reported by WHO estimates an average of 5 – 6 days up to 14 days [ 31 ] . A serial interval shorter than the incubation period implies the pre - symptomatic transmission during the incubation period . Therefore it is difficult to contain the epidemic , as an infectious person during this period is hard to identify and is likely to be moving around [ 25 , 29 ] . In this study , the SIR was found to be higher in the elderly above 60 years of age ( 42 . 1 % [ 31 . 0 – 53 . 2 % ] ) though it did not reach a statistical significance . And SIR in children less than 10 years ( 31 . 7 % [ 20 . 3 – 43 . 2 % ] ) is higher than those of adolescents ( 28 . 3 % ( 20 . 5 – 36 . 2 % ] ) and young and middle aged adults ( 28 . 8 % [ 24 . 2 – 33 . 3 % ] ) and it is in line with the results of other studies conducted across the globe [ 1 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 20 , 22 , 23 ] . A study in South Korea noted rela - tively high transmission from index cases for those aged 10 to 19 years . Although children seem to be at reduced risk for symptomatic disease , it is still unclear whether they shed virus similarly to adults [ 1 , 23 , 32 ] . PLOS ONE Householdtransmission investigation of COVID - 19 PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0287048 October 5 , 2023 10 / 14 In this study , the primary care giver of the index case showed a higher SIR ( 36 . 8 % [ 31 . 0 – 42 . 5 % ] ) compared to others ( 26 . 1 % [ 21 . 6 – 30 . 5 % ] ) . The former had 1 . 6 times more risk of becoming the secondary case ( OR 1 . 60 , 95 % CI : 1 . 42 – 2 . 85 , p < 0 . 05 ) . The primary care giver was majorly the spouse who looked after the COVID positive case . This corroborates with the previously reported studies [ 1 , 6 , 10 , 20 ] . Spouses were at higher risk than other household contacts possibly due to their active involvement in the care taking activities of the positive cases . This may have resulted in prolonged , very close physical contact with the index cases and hence longer or more direct exposure to the index case . Another household factor that was a significant risk factor in our study was overcrowding at the households . Secondary cases residing in overcrowded households showed a higher SIR ( SIR 34 . 8 % [ 95 % CI : 26 . 0 – 43 . 6 % ] ) compared to non - overcrowded ones ( SIR 29 . 6 % [ 95 % CI : 25 . 8 – 33 . 5 % ] ) and the former had 1 . 43 times more risk of becoming the secondary case ( OR 1 . 43 , 95 % CI : 1 . 13 – 2 . 26 , p < 0 . 05 ) . This is supported by the study in Israel which showed that relatively large numbers of cohabi - tants living in a close - knit community contributed to the study’s reported high household SIR [ 22 ] . In contrary to this , a study in Kerala reported a mild negative correlation between the number of positive COVID - 19 cases and rooms per person denoting that even though over - crowding should have increased the number of cases there can be multiple other associated concealed or unidentified factors and natural immunity or resistance to the virus which might be playing a role in determining the rate of household transmission of COVID – 19 [ 5 ] . Another significant risk factor was that household contacts with underlying medical condi - tions had higher SIR ( SIR 42 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 31 . 0 – 53 . 2 % ] ) compared with those who did not ( SIR 28 . 9 % [ 95 % CI : 25 . 3 – 32 . 7 % ] ) and the former had 1 . 83 times more risk of becoming the secondary case ( OR 1 . 83 , 95 % CI : 1 . 09 – 3 . 05 , p < 0 . 05 ) . This is in line with most of the studies that stated old age and comorbid conditions are independent risk factors of COVID - 19 infec - tions explaining the higher transmission rate in elderly in household SAR as well [ 6 , 9 , 20 ] . One interesting risk factor that was found to be significantly associated with secondary dis - ease transmission in COVID was sharing the same toilet as used by the positive case of COVID . Sharing a toilet with index case showed a higher SIR ( 36 . 7 % [ 95 % CI : 16 . 0 – 57 . 4 % ] ) and such contacts had 1 . 82 times more risk of contracting the disease ( OR = 1 . 82 , 95 % CI : 1 . 29 – 2 . 93 , p < 0 . 05 ) . The possible reasons may be the lots of contact surfaces ( handles , taps , etc ) where the virus may survive and pass from one person to another ; the presence of cold and wet surfaces which are conducive to viral survival ; flushing toilets that can contribute to aero - sol transfer of the virus to the air and contamination of adjacent surfaces ; the possibility of non - disinfected toilets [ 33 ] . In this study , household contacts who were wearing mask when coming in contact with the index case showed a lower SIR ( 37 . 1 % [ 3 . 5 – 70 . 5 % ] ) than those who were not wearing mask when coming in contact with the primary case . Household contacts who were wearing masks had decreased risk for COVID 19 ( OR = 0 . 86 , 95 % CI : 0 . 56 – 0 . 93 , p < 0 . 05 ) . This in fact is sup - ported by various other studies [ 9 , 10 , 20 , 22 , 34 ] . A study conducted in Beijing , China reported face masks were 79 % effective in preventing transmission [ 34 ] . The findings inform universal face mask use , not just in public spaces , but inside the household with members at risk of infection reducing the risk of transmission . Studies also showed that non - pharmacolog - ical interventions like separate dining , indoor isolation , ventilation and disinfection , index patient living alone , and social distancing are effective at preventing transmission , even in homes that are crowded and small houses [ 9 , 10 , 34 ] . This study has few strengths as this is one among the first few studies conducted prospec - tively in investigating the household transmission investigation of COVID 19 in India with adequate follow ups up to 28 days and adequate testing with RT PCR and serology . But it is not free of limitations . We assumed that only household transmission was responsible for PLOS ONE Householdtransmission investigation of COVID - 19 PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0287048 October 5 , 2023 11 / 14 secondary infections among household contacts . So the household SIR could be an overesti - mation , although simultaneous quarantine orders for household contacts could have limited the community exposures . Also , the initial household member who experienced symptoms and tested positive was considered the index patient . Still , it is possible that other household members were infected concurrently or even prior to the index case but developed symptoms at different times or remained asymptomatic thus not diagnosed . Also , in estimation of incu - bation period , we have not used any statistical models and considered median incubation period . Since this is a follow up study , there was an issue with loss to follow up and few sample refusals which could have underestimated our estimation of the SIR . Conclusion and recommendations Our study highlights the important aspects of secondary infection rates , risk factors , and epide - miological parameters associated with COVID - 19 in household contacts with recent exposure to patients with SARS - COV - 2 . Despite household contacts developing COVID infection , a sig - nificant number of individuals did not develop an infection in spite of sharing the same house - hold , which indicates a role of individual - specific natural immunity for resistance to COVID - 19 . As transmission occurs favourably within households , immediate isolation of the index case with separate dining , sleep room , lavatory , adequate ventilation and wearing masks is mandatory . Along with isolation of index cases , following infection control activities ( hand - washing , wearing masks , social distancing ) customarily by the household contacts especially by the spouse and those with any comorbid conditions . The household contacts should be receptive to following all the COVID prevention protocols before the local health authorities intervene in decreasing the disease transmission among them .
