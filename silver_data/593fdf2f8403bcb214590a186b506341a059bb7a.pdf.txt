A plasma membrane template for macropinocytic cups Douwe M Veltman 1 , 2 * , Thomas D Williams 1 , Gareth Bloomfield 1 , Bi - Chang Chen 3‡ , Eric Betzig 3 , Robert H Insall 2† , Robert R Kay 1† 1 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , United Kingdom ; 2 Beatson Institute for Cancer Research , Glasgow , United Kingdom ; 3 Janelia Farm Research Campus , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Ashburn , United States Abstract Macropinocytosis is a fundamental mechanism that allows cells to take up extracellular liquid into large vesicles . It critically depends on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane , which develops into the macropinocytic cup . We show that macropinocytic cups in Dictyostelium are organised around coincident intense patches of PIP 3 , active Ras and active Rac . These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR / WAVE at their periphery , as are all examined structures based on PIP 3 patches , including phagocytic cups and basal waves . Patch formation does not depend on the enclosing F - actin ring , and patches become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated , showing that Ras plays an instructive role . New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones . We propose that cup - shaped plasma membrane structures form from self - organizing patches of active Ras / PIP 3 , which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 . 001 Introduction Macropinocytosis provides cells with an efficient way of taking up large volumes of medium into intracellular vesicles , from which they can extract nutrients , antigens and other useful molecules ( Bloomfield and Kay , 2016 ; Egami et al . , 2014 ; Maniak , 2001 ; Swanson , 2008 ; Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) . It is an ancient process , used for feeding by amoebae ( Hacker et al . , 1997 ; Thilo and Vogel , 1980 ) , but one that is important for a wide spectrum of human biology , including uptake of drugs , and large - scale sampling of extracellular medium for antigens by immune cells . It has also been hijacked by pathogens as a major route of entry ( Mercer and Helenius , 2012 ) . Recent data suggest that macropinocytosis is a principal and widely used method for sustaining the excessive metabolic demands of cancer cells ( Commisso et al . , 2013 ; Kamphorst et al . , 2015 ) and may be implicated in the spread of neurodegenerative disease within the brain ( Mu¨nch et al . , 2011 ) . Considering its biological importance , macropinocytosis is not well understood . Macropinosomes form from cup - shaped extensions of the plasma membrane , often known as circular ruffles , which are extended by actin polymerisation . The leading rims of these ruffles must be driven outwards to enclose liquid – often for a very significant fraction of the cell’s diameter – but the base must be held static . The resulting cups can be several microns in diameter , and eventually close by constric - tion of their rim , with membrane fusion producing an endocytic vesicle . Here we address a critical and mysterious question about this process - how do cells organize actin to polymerize in a ring and so form the walls of the cup ? In the closely related process of phagocytosis , in which solid particles are taken up , it is proposed that cup formation is guided by engaging receptors with the particle to be engulfed in a zippering process ( Freeman and Grinstein , 2014 ; Griffin et al . , 1975 ) . However , macropinosomes take up fluid and so cannot use a particle as a template in this way . Nor is there any known equivalent in Veltman et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e20085 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 1 of 24 RESEARCH ARTICLE macropinocytosis of the coat that organises clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Thus it appears that mac - ropinocytic cups must form by a self - organizing process within the actin polymerization machinery and its regulators . The dynamic actin that polymerises around macropinocytic cups is probably initiated by a number of nucleators , including both formins , such as ForG , which is needed for the basal part of phagocytic cups in Dictyostelium ( Junemann et al . , 2016 ) , and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Insall et al . , 2001 ) , which produces dendritic structures ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , like the actin that drives pseudopods . Assembly of Arp2 / 3 based actin is controlled by the WASP family of nucleation promoting factors ; the two family members that act at the plasma membrane are WASP and SCAR / WAVE ( hereafter called SCAR ) . WASP is important for actin polymerisation during clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , and SCAR , acting in a five - membered complex ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) , for the for - mation of pseudopods ( Seastone et al . , 2001 ; Veltman et al . , 2012 ) . It is not known which is responsible for macropinocytosis . Ras and phosphoinositide signalling help organize the cytoskeleton for macropinocytosis and phagocytosis ( Bar - Sagi and Feramisco , 1986 ; Bloomfield and Kay , 2016 ; Bohdanowicz and Grin - stein , 2013 ; Rodriguez - Viciana et al . , 1997 ; Swanson , 2014 ) . There is evidence that Ras activity stimulates macropinocytosis in both mammalian and Dictyostelium cells , and macropinocytic cups are associated with an intense domain , or ‘patch’ , of PIP 3 ( Araki et al . , 2007 ; Parent et al . , 1998 ; Yoshida et al . , 2009 ) , which is essential for their function ( Araki et al . , 1996 ; Buczynski et al . , 1997 ; Hoeller et al . , 2013 ; Zhou et al . , 1998 ) . In macrophages , which often evolve macropinocytic cups from linear ruffles , it has been sug - gested that ruffle circularisation creates a diffusion barrier in the membrane leading to intensified PIP 3 signalling and a domain of PIP 3 in the centre of the circular ruffle ( Welliver et al . , 2011 ) . This domain then drives the further progression of the macropinocytic cup . In axenic strains of Dictyostelium , which grow efficiently in liquid medium , macropinocytosis is massively up - regulated due to mutation of the RasGAP neurofibromatosis - 1 ( NF1 ) ( Bloomfield et al . , 2015 ; Hacker et al . , 1997 ; Kayman and Clarke , 1983 ) . These strains are thus an excellent starting point for research into the organising principles behind macropinocytic cup forma - tion . Here we examine macropinocytosis with unprecedented 3D detail using lattice light sheet microscopy , and map the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SCAR and WASP eLife digest Cells can use a process known as macropinocytosis to take up fluid from their surroundings . This process plays an important role in many situations . For example , it allows human immune cells to sample their environment to search for harmful microbes and viruses and helps cancer cells to collect more nutrients so that they can grow more rapidly . During macropinocytosis , a protein called actin – which provides structural support to cells – drives the formation of cup - shaped structures from the membrane that surrounds the cell . Several signaling molecules control when and where the “cups” form , but it was not known exactly how the different types of molecules work together . Here Veltman et al . used a technique called lattice light sheet microscopy to investigate how the macropinocytic cups form in a single - celled amoeba known as Dictyostelium . The experiments revealed that to make a cup , the actin first arranges to form a ring . The ring copies a template in the membrane , which consists of high concentrations of signaling molecules , and then extends outward to form a hollow cup by which fluid is taken up . The most important signaling molecule identified in these patches of membrane is a protein called Ras , which is mutated and hyperactive in many different types of cancer . In Dictyostelium cells that have a genetic mutation that makes Ras more active , the patches of signaling molecules and macropinocytic cups were larger than in normal cells . The findings of Veltman et al . provide new details about how cells engulf fluids from their surroundings . The next steps will be to investigate how the signaling molecules form patches in the first place , and how they attract actin molecules . Also , more research is necessary to find out whether all cells take up fluid in a similar way or if other methods have evolved in mammalian cells .

This leads us to propose a new and general hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane . Results The origins of macropinosomes in axenic strains of Dictyostelium To determine whether macropinosomes form in Dictyostelium by circularization of linear ruffles , as reported for macrophages ( Welliver and Swanson , 2012 ) , we used lattice light sheet microscopy ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) , which allows unparalleled high - resolution imaging of light - sensitive and dynamic cells over prolonged periods . In axenic cells expressing an F - actin reporter , three types of large F - actin structure are routinely detected : macropinocytic cups , which predominate , pseudopods and basal waves . 3D movies show that the majority of macropinocytic cups initiate by splitting of existing ones ( 62 % ; n = 152 , Figure 1E ) . Splitting occurs by a variety of routes , including : simple division in the middle ; detachment of a small ruffle that grows into a new macropinocytic cup ( Figure 1A , Video 1 ) ; and abortive fragmentation of a parental macropinocytic cup into multiple daughter cups . We exam - ined a reporter for active Rac in some of these movies and found that it is spatiotemporally associ - ated tightly with F - actin in this morphological process ( Figure 1B , Video 2 ) . The remaining macropinocytic cups form de novo , expanding from places where no previous F - actin activity was detected . In more than 90 % of cases the initiation is close to the base of the cell , even though most mature macropinocytic cups are present on the top , and are commonly described as ’crowns’ . In the example illustrated in Figure 1C ( Video 3 ) , the parental ruffle first emerges close to the substratum ( t = 0 , white arrow ) and cannot unequivocally be classified as either pseudopod or circular ruffle . The ruffle then quickly sweeps to the top of the cell , during which time it grows in size and splits several times , to produce multiple full - grown macropinocytic cups . As with splitting macro - pinocytic cups , the F - actin in de novo macropinosome cups is closely associated with signalling mol - ecules , as illustrated by active Ras in Figure 1D ( Video 4 ) and discussed later . Circular ruffles can persist on the cell surface for prolonged periods before either closing successfully or regressing back into the cell body . Closure of the cup can be quite abrupt and often appears to involve the inward collapse of the rim ( Figure 1F , Video 5 ) ( Swanson et al . , 1999 ) . The other large F - actin projections in growing Dictyostelium cells are pseudopods . These are dis - tinguished from macropinocytic circular ruffles by their shape , which is convex instead of concave . De novo pseudopods also initiate close to the substratum ( Figure 1G , white arrow and Video 6 ) and expand steadily to their full size . Pseudopods are surprisingly rare in growing axenic cells , account - ing for less than 5 % of all large F - actin structures . Finally , we could follow the enigmatic actin waves that move across the basal surface of vegeta - tive cells ( Bretschneider et al . , 2004 , 2009 ; Gerisch , 2010 ) . These waves also generally originate from existing ruffles by splitting . When the splitting ruffle in Figure 1H ( Video 7 ) contacts the sub - stratum , it initiates an actin wave that spreads across the entire footprint of the cell , becoming so dominant that other large F - actin structures are suppressed and flattening the cell into a smooth bell - shape . These observations show that the large macropinocytic cups of axenic Dictyostelium cells gener - ally form by splitting or by expanding de novo from a small focus , as in fibroblasts ( Bernitt et al . , 2015 ) , rather than by circularization of linear ruffles ( Welliver and Swanson , 2012 ) . The smaller mac - ropinocytic cups of wild - type cells ( see later ) also more normally form de novo or by splitting , rather than by circularization . PIP 3 , Ras and SCAR are required for normal fluid phase uptake We tested the involvement of PIP3 and Ras signalling in macropinocytosis using an isogenic set of mutants in which we measured both fluid uptake and growth in liquid medium ( Supplementary mate - rial , Table 1 ) . Either increased or decreased PIP 3 levels ( PTEN and PI3 - kinase mutants ) are deleteri - ous to fluid uptake and growth in liquid medium , as expected from earlier work ( Clark et al . , 2014 ; Hoeller and Kay , 2007 ) . Two independent RasG - mutants are substantially impaired in growth in liq - uid medium , as previously described , but contrary to the earlier report ( Khosla et al . , 2000 ) , both are also defective in fluid uptake .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 4 of 24 Research article Cell Biology differences may account for the discrepancy ( Bloomfield et al . , 2008 ; Bolourani et al . , 2010 ) . RasC null cells have no growth defect and a lesser defect in fluid uptake , while RasS ( not tested here ) may also contribute to macropinocytosis ( Chubb et al . , 2000 ) . Notably , we confirm that the Arp2 / 3 acti - vator , SCAR , is required for efficient fluid uptake ( Seastone et al . , 2001 ) . A ring of active SCAR forms around PIP 3 domains at the rim of macropinocytic cups The SCAR complex is mostly cytosolic and basally inactive , but when recruited to the plasma mem - brane it causes actin polymerization through the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Steffen et al . , 2004 ; Ura et al . , 2012 ) . A GFP reporter tagged at the HSPC300 subunit accumulates at sites of actin polymerization ( Veltman et al . , 2012 ) . To confirm that this accumulation signifies the presence of activated SCAR complex , we correlated the signal with the expansion of pseudopods , using this as a proxy for actin polymerization . The results clearly show that the reporter is recruited during expansion phases but lost in stalls ( Figure 2A , B ) . This correlation holds true globally : SCAR reporter intensity along the membrane correlates well with the local membrane expansion speed ( Figure 2C ) as all pixels with high SCAR reporter are associated with positive instantaneous membrane speed . Note that the small set of pixels with very high membrane speeds and no SCAR ( Figure 2C , red arrow ) are due to blebs ( Zatulovskiy et al . , 2014 ) . In images recorded in 3D , the reporter reveals a thin , sometimes broken ring of active SCAR around the lip of macropinocytic cups ( Figure 2D and Video 8 ) . The presence of a ring could not be predicted by imaging the actin cytoskeleton itself , as actin filaments are distributed rather uniformly throughout the cup ( Figure 2H ) . These circular SCAR structures are not seen in pseudopods , where 3D images show the same discrete blocks of SCAR as in 2D images ( Figure 2E ) . The discovery of these remarkable rings immediately raises the question of how individual SCAR molecules are coordinated to maintain the ring shape . We visualised PIP 3 using a double reporter that co - expresses the PH - domain of CRAC fused to RFP ( Insall et al . , 1994 ) . This revealed a Figure 1 continued cluster of macropinocytic cups from a small basal F - actin structure ( arrow ) .

In all macropinocytic cups examined , of whatever size , the concave cup contains a patch of PIP 3 and SCAR is present as a ring around this patch , with - out detectable recruitment to its centre ( Figure 2F and G and Video 9 ) . This was confirmed in a larger sample by mea - suring fluorescence intensity at the centre and rim of 17 macropinocytic cups from nine cells ren - dered in 3D ( Figure 3A – B ) . All cup centres con - tained high levels of PIP 3 , but SCAR consistently followed the rim of the cup with the mean fluo - rescence of the SCAR reporter significantly higher than cytosolic background ( p < 0 . 01 ) , while signal at the centre of the PIP 3 patch was not sta - tistically different from the cytosolic background . This is also clear in 2D images , but is easily over - looked as the narrow SCAR ring appears only as tiny puncta in the cross sections obtained from confocal microscopy . We further tested the spatial relation between PIP 3 and SCAR in two ways not requiring visual recognition of macropinocytic cups . In the first , a number of growing axenic cells was analysed as follows . Membrane areas with fluorescence inten - sity of the PIP 3 reporter greater than cytosolic background plus one standard deviation were defined as PIP 3 patches , and the associated SCAR signal was measured . In all cases SCAR is consistently and significantly enriched at patch edges ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and never at their centres ( Figure 3C – D ) . In the sec - ond test , the fluorescence intensity of the SCAR and PIP 3 reporters was extracted from the circum - ference of a number of growing cells and the results plotted as a 2D histogram ( Figure 3E ) . In pixels with high PIP 3 signal , the SCAR signal is low , and conversely in pixels with high SCAR , PIP 3 is low . This method cannot show whether high SCAR and PIP 3 pixels are adjacent , but it does confirm that SCAR and PIP 3 do not co - localise but instead are anti - correlated . SCAR is associated to the periphery of PIP 3 patches throughout macropinocytic cup lifetime The complete lifetime of a de novo macropino - cytic cup is shown in Figure 4A ( Video 10 shows another example ) . The PIP 3 patch first becomes visible at t = 1 and this sub - micron sized patch is already flanked by puncta of SCAR . As the patch of PIP 3 grows the SCAR puncta remain dynami - cally associated with its edge right up to closure of the macropinocytic cup , after which the SCAR signal quickly disappears and the vesicle is intern - alised . The SCAR is not detected at the centres of the patches above background . This is also shown in a kymograph of the mem - brane pixels of a single cell as it makes several macropinosomes ( Figure 4B ) . The SCAR signal , though sometimes weak , can be traced along the edge of the PIP 3 patches from the start of a patch to its abrupt loss at invagination .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 6 of 24 Research article Cell Biology events confirms this continuous association ( Figure 4C – E ) . Thus despite changes in size and shape of PIP 3 patches , SCAR remains associated with their edges , and only their edges , through - out the macropinocytic cup lifetime . All PIP 3 patches , whatever their origin , recruit SCAR to their periphery It seemed possible that as a rule of cytoskeletal organization in Dictyostelium , PIP 3 patches always recruit SCAR to their edges . Four other examples of PIP 3 patches support this : two from growing cells , and two from starved cells , which are highly migratory , chemotactically sensitive , and morphologically very different from growing cells : During phagocytosis Dictyostelium cells make a PIP 3 patch where they contact the particle to be ingested ( Clarke et al . , 2010 ; Marshall et al . , 2001 ) . In the yeast case shown in Figure 5A , SCAR is recruited to the edges of the PIP 3 patch , and not the centre , while a 3D view reveals a full ring of SCAR around the rim of the phagocytic cup . Indeed , a clear ring of SCAR could be detected in all such cases , provided expression of the SCAR reporter was low enough to avoid excessive back - ground fluorescence . Basal waves have a core of PIP 3 surrounded by a ring of F - actin ( Bretschneider et al . , 2004 , 2009 ; Gerhardt et al . , 2014 ; Gerisch , 2010 ) , and again , the basal PIP 3 patches are invariably sur - rounded by a ring of SCAR ( Figure 5B ) . Basal waves are favourable for microscopy , and we found that WASP is also excluded from PIP 3 patches and forms a ring around them , though weaker and less coherently than SCAR ( Figure 5C ) . Similarly , WASP forms rings at the edges of PIP 3 patches of normal macropinocytic cups , again more weakly than SCAR ( Figure 5D ) . The remaining Arp2 / 3 acti - vator in Dictyostelium , WASH , does not associate with PIP 3 patches ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Video 5 . Closure of a macropinocytic cup .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 7 of 24 Research article Cell Biology During chemotactic aggregation , developing cells form small chains and streams with strong head - to - tail adhesions between them and PIP 3 patches in their front ( Dormann et al . , 2002 ) . These patches are invariably surrounded by a ring of SCAR . In the example shown in Figure 5E – G , a cell strongly expressing reporters is situated between two poorly expressing cells . The strongly express - ing cell forms a PIP 3 contact patch , with SCAR present as a clear ring and excluded from the centre . Cells respond to cyclic - AMP by making PIP 3 , initially homogenously and then , after about a min - ute , in patches at the membrane ( Postma et al . , 2004 ) . In the low light conditions required for time - lapse imaging , the SCAR signal is weak , but where detected , it is clearly at the edges of the PIP 3 patches ( Figure 5H – J and Video 11 ) . These patches have sometimes been regarded as new pseu - dopods ( for example [ Chen et al . , 2003 ] ) , but many become concave and close to engulf a drop of medium , indicating that the cell is performing macropinocytosis , not a chemotactic response . PIP 3 patches are based on active Ras but do not require F - actin ruffles PIP 3 is largely made by Ras - activated PI3 - kinases ( Clark et al . , 2014 ; Funamoto et al . , 2002 ; Hoeller and Kay , 2007 ) . We confirmed that a patch of activated Ras exactly coincides with each PIP 3 patch ( Figure 6A ) ( Sasaki et al . , 2004 ; 2007 ) . Similarly , plots of intensity , pixel - by - pixel , show exceptional correlation between the Ras and PIP 3 signals ( Figure 6B ) . Thus PIP 3 patches have a matching patch of activated Ras , which could sustain them by activating PI3 - kinase . Video 7 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 9 of 24 Research article Cell Biology Similarly , the Ras / PIP 3 patch overlaps a patch of active Rac1 , as detected by the CRIB domain ( Figure 6C ) ( Manser et al . , 1994 ) . Rac1 is an upstream regulator of SCAR , and has been implicated in macropinocytosis ( Dumontier et al . , 2000 ; Palmieri et al . , 2000 ) . However , its broad distribution cannot simply account for the much narrower SCAR ring . Alternatively , Rac1 may define a permissive area where SCAR can be activated or other Rac isoforms may be involved , such as RacB , RacC or RacG ( Lee et al . , 2003 ; Seastone et al . , 1998 ) . No specific markers exist for their activated state , but the RacG molecule itself is modestly enriched at the rim of phagocytic cups ( Somesh et al . , 2006 ) . A B μ C μ μ D μ E Figure 3 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 10 of 24 Research article Cell Biology It has been proposed that PIP 3 patch formation requires a positive feedback loop where PIP 3 acti - vates Ras ( Sasaki et al . , 2007 ) . We tested this by genetically manipulating PIP 3 levels ( Clark et al . , 2014 ; Hoeller and Kay , 2007 ) . A mutant without Ras - activated PI3 - kinases and producing only 10 % of wild - type PIP 3 levels still forms patches of activated Ras at a similar frequency to parental cells ( Figure 6D ) . The SCAR signal in confocal cross sections of macropinocytic cups is too small for an accurate comparison of SCAR ring formation between mutants and therefore we used basal waves as a proxy for macropinocytic cups . Ras patches on the basal surface of PI3 - kinase null cells still exclude SCAR from their centre and recruit a peripheral ring of SCAR as normal , albeit more weakly than in parental cells ( Figure 6E – F ) . Conversely , when PIP 3 levels are increased 10 - fold by eliminat - ing the PTEN phosphatase , the activated Ras domains do not expand correspondingly ( Figure 6G ) and remain associated with rings of SCAR ( Figure 6H ) . Thus Ras , rather than PIP 3 , is the primary determinant of patches and SCAR rings . It has also been proposed that PIP 3 patch formation requires an enclosing circular ruffle to act as a diffusion trap ( Welliver and Swanson , 2012 ) . We tested this by controlled use of the actin inhibi - tor latrunculin - A to inhibit ruffle formation . Latrunculin - A at 1 m M leaves some actin polymerisation intact , and at 5 m M abolishes all visible actin filaments , resulting in spherical cells ( Figure 7A ) . Nei - ther treatment abolishes the patches of PIP 3 , which become larger but less numerous , with a μ A B μ C D E Figure 4 . A SCAR ring encircles PIP 3 patches throughout their lifetime .

We tested whether the sharp boundaries of patches are affected by latrunculin - A by measuring the intensity across the edges of more than 30 patches for each condition , ( Figure 7F – H ) . It is clear that latrunculin - A has lit - tle effect on the sharpness of the patch , suggesting that a diffusion barrier is not required to main - tain its strong spatial coherence . In summary , a circular ruffle is not essential to create signalling patches , which appear to largely depend on Ras , with PIP 3 playing a secondary though still important role . The intensity of Ras signalling controls patch and macropinocytic cup size To test whether Ras plays an instructive role in macropinocytic cup morphogenesis , directly regulat - ing their formation and size rather than acting as a remote trigger or passive participant , we exam - ined the effect of genetically increasing Ras activity . The RasGAP NF1 , encoded by the Dictyostelium axeB gene , is present in the wild - isolate NC4 but inactivated in its axenic derivatives , including the standard Ax2 used here . We found that macropinocytic cups in NC4 maintain exactly the same organization as in Ax2 , with a central patch of PIP 3 surround by a ring of SCAR , but are much smaller and shorter - lived and often arise de novo ( Figure 7I , J and Videos 12 , 13 and 14 ) . To confirm that macropinocytic cup size is controlled Video 9 . Macropinocytic cups are defined by a patch of PIP 3 that is circumscribed by a thin line of SCAR .

( H – J ) Response to acute stimulation with the chemoattractant cyclic - AMP . Aggregation - competent cells ( equivalent to about 5 hr of starvation ) were uniformly stimulated with a saturating dose of cyclic - AMP ( 1 m M ) . They respond with a fast and spatially fairly uniform production of PIP 3 at 4 s and later with a secondary response in which clear PIP 3 patches are formed ( panel H , t = 99s ) . SCAR is uniquely present at the edges of these patches ( arrowed ) as is most evident in the kymograph ( I ) and not at the centre ( J ) .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 . 019 Veltman et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e20085 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 13 of 24 Research article Cell Biology by NF1 we compared an isogenic NF1 knock - out with its parent ( DdB ; also derived from NC4 ; [ Bloomfield et al . , 2008 ] ) . Cells from each strain were cultivated for 48 hr in axenic medium to maximally induce the rate of macropinocytosis . Under these conditions the axeB - null cells that have lost NF1 make significantly larger macropi - nocytic patches compared to cells from the parental strain ( p < 0 . 01 , Figure 7K – L ) . The effect of the loss of NF1 on basal PIP 3 patches ( basal actin waves ) is equally striking . Basal PIP 3 patches are prevalent in axenic laboratory strains , especially during early starvation , but absent from all wild - type strains tested ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and compare Videos 15 and 16 ) . axeB knockout cells that have lost NF1 form abundant basal PIP 3 patches , but their wild - type parent does not ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1D ) . Thus the intensity of Ras signalling governs the size and frequency of SCAR rings in macropinocytic cups and basal waves , showing that Ras must play an instructive role . We therefore propose that Ras patches , assisted by PI3 - kinase and Rac , cause macropinocytic cup formation by recruiting rings of SCAR / WAVE complex to their edge . Discussion Macropinosomes develop from cup - shaped projections of the plasma membrane , whose walls are driven outwards by actin polymerization . They contain a central patch of activated Ras and PIP 3 throughout their life and we find that in Dictyostelium , this patch is invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR at its edge . We propose that this ring of active SCAR is recruited by the signalling patch and drives a hollow ring of F - actin to extend the walls of the macropinocytic cup . A possible alternative mechanism comes from immune cells , which make abundant linear ruffles . These occasionally fold back to form circular ruffles , which have been described as diffusion traps that can intensify signalling within them , leading to the formation of a patch of active Ras and PIP 3 , ( Welliver et al . , 2011 ) . In this model , PIP 3 patches form as a consequence of circular ruffle forma - tion , rather than as a cause of it . Despite the evidence that sharply curved membrane areas such as those present at the leading edge of lamellipods can act as a diffusion barrier ( Weisswange et al . , 2005 ) , this idea does not easily extend to Dictyostelium , where linear ruffles are much less common , and the central PIP 3 patch of macropinocytic cups can still form when ruffle formation is inhibited . However it remains possible that a diffusion barrier forms by a ruffle - independent mechanism , for example by septin - like molecules ( Golebiewska et al . , 2011 ) , or perhaps by cross - linking compo - nents within the patch . Further , Dictyostelium patches become larger when Ras signalling is increased by NF1 inactivation , showing that Ras plays an instructive part in their formation . PIP 3 patches are coincident with patches of activated Ras , which presumably support them by activating PI3 - kinase , and also of activated Rac . Previous work suggest that patches are self - organis - ing structures , which can form independently of input from G - protein coupled receptors ( Sasaki et al . , 2007 ) and are likely dependent on positive feedback loops between their components Video 11 . Chemoattractant - stimulated PIP 3 patches recruit SCAR to their edges , not to their centres .

Our results argue against an essential role for feedback from PIP 3 to Ras , because activated Ras patches can form independently of type - 1 PI3 - kinases and are still able to recruit SCAR to their edges , albeit less efficiently than when PI3 - kinases are present .

SCAR remains associated with the Figure 7 continued on next page Veltman et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e20085 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 16 of 24 Research article Cell Biology appears that the kinetics that lead to patch formation must lie largely within the compass of the GEFs and GAPs activating and inactivating Ras . We can only speculate on how SCAR is recruited to the periphery of Ras / PIP 3 patches . One possi - bility is that SCAR and Arp2 / 3 are preferentially recruited by newly synthesised F - actin ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) produced by formins ( Jasnin et al . , 2016 ) , which might therefore be the ini - tial actin nucleator to be recruited . However , this seems unlikely in the light of recent work showing that ForG contributes to the base of the macropinocytic cup , but seemingly not to the extending lip ( Junemann et al . , 2016 ) . Alternatively , SCAR might be moved to the periphery of Ras / PIP 3 patches , perhaps by myosin - 1 motors . Early work showed that myosin - 1 is genetically important for macropi - nocytosis in Dictyostelium ( Novak et al . , 1995 ; Titus , 2000 ) . In support of the genetic evidence , myosin - 1 isoforms are recruited to macropinocytic cups in both Dictyostelium and Acanthamoeba Figure 7 continued patch edge under 1 m M latrunculin - A , but is lost when treated with 5 m M latrunculin - A . ( C – E ) Ruffles are not essential for PIP 3 patch formation . Treatment with latrunculin - A does not significantly change PIP 3 patch intensity , but leads to an increase in size and a decrease in number . ( F – H ) Patch boundaries are sharply defined and this does not depend on an enclosing ruffle .

Macropinocytosis is rapid and small but the cups still show SCAR puncta on their edges . Images were taken on a spinning disk microscope . It should be noted that due to the small size of the macropinocytic cups , the top and bottom of the cup are frequently in the focal plane , resulting in an overlap in both signals .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 17 of 24 Research article Cell Biology ( Brzeska et al . , 2012 ; Ostap et al . , 2003 ) , most likely due to their affinity for PIP3 ( Chen et al . , 2012 ) . The PIP3 - binding MyoE and MyoF are recruited in the centre and MyoB at the periphery of macropinocytic cups , forming a striking ‘bull’s eye’ pattern ( Brzeska et al . , 2016 ; Dieckmann et al . , 2010 ) . In such a scenario , CARMIL may provide the link between myosin - 1 and SCAR ( Jung et al . , 2001 ) . Our work also has implications more specific to Dictyostelium biology . First , the basal actin waves , which give a valuable window into actin dynamics ( Bretschneider et al . , 2004 , 2009 ; Ger - isch , 2010 ) , appear to be formed as a consequence of the loss of NF1 in standard laboratory axenic strains . Knowing this should allow for better manipulation of these waves and for modelling to take account of their underlying need for activated Ras ( Arai et al . , 2010 ; Khamviwath et al . , 2013 ; Sasaki et al . , 2007 ; Taniguchi et al . , 2013 ) . Second , we consider that all patches of PIP 3 and acti - vated Ras are related by their common recruitment of SCAR to their periphery and are therefore likely to organise circular rings of actin polymerization , rather than the solid blocks characteristic of pseudopods . Therefore , the proposed role of these patches in chemotaxis , where they have been mistaken for pseudopods , needs to be re - evaluated . In summary , our work suggests a general hypothesis for the formation of cupped actin structures : that these structures arise from a ring of actin polymerization formed by recruiting actin nucleators to the periphery , but not the centre , of self - organizing patches of intense Ras and PIP 3 signalling . This hypothesis suggests many new lines of experimentation . Materials and methods Cell strains , cultivation and fluid uptake assay The following Dictyostelium discoideum strains were used : Ax2 ( R . Kay lab strain ) , NC4 ( from K . Raper , obtained via P .

Axenic strains were cultured in Petri dishes under HL5 medium ( Formedium , Hunstanton , UK ) using standard methods . Non - axenic strains were cultivated on SM agar plates with a lawn of live Klebsiella pneumoniae and where necessary washed free of bacteria by repeated low - speed centrifugation from KK2 ( 20 mM KH 2 PO 4 / K 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , pH 6 . 2 ) ( for detailed protocols of these standard techniques , see ( Kay , 1987 ) and dictybase . org / techniques / ) . Mutant strains , all in the parental Ax2 ( Kay ) background , are listed in Supplementary Material , Table 1 . Fluid uptake was measured using TRITC - dextran and flow cytometry . Cells were grown on bacte - rial lawns , washed free of bacteria , resuspended in HL5 with antibiotics , 50 m l aliquots were distrib - uted into 96 plates and allowed to adapt for about 18 hr , until macropinocytosis was maximally up - regulated . TRITC - dextran was added to 0 . 5 mg / ml in HL5 to the wells and the cells incubated for various times , after which the TRITC dextran was removed , the cells washed once and uptake termi - nated with ice - cold , 5 mM NaN 3 , which also detaches the cells . Fluorescence in individual cells was then measured by flow cytometry , and the rate determined while uptake was linear with time ( first 45 – 60 min ) . DNA constructs and transfection Single and dual expression vectors were used for all experiments ( Veltman et al . , 2009 ) . Specifically , the following vectors were used : plasmid pDM1219 - expression of mCherry - LimE D coil ( residue 1 – 145 of Dd LimE ) , pDM767 - dual expression of HSPC300 - GFP and PH - CRAC - mRFPmars ( residue 1 – 126 of Dd DagA ) , pDM1492 - dual expression of mCherry - RBD - Raf1 ( residue 1 – 134 of Hs Raf1 ) and PH - PkgE - mCherry ( residue 1 – 100 of Dd PkgE ) , pDM1383 - dual expression of HSPC300 - GFP and mCherry - RBD - Raf1 and pDM1424 - dual expression of HSPC300 - GFP and PH - PkgE - mCherry . The act6 promoter that drives the resistance marker on the expression vectors is not active when cells are cultivated using bacteria as a food source . Therefore , this promoter was replaced by the coaA promoter ( bp (cid:0) 293 to bp (cid:0) 1 relative to the start codon of coaA ) for those vectors that were used to transfect non - axenic , wild - type cells . Transfection of non - axenic cells was performed as follows : 5 (cid:2) 10 6 cells were harvested from the feeding front of an SM agar plate , washed once in H40 buffer ( 40 mM HEPES / KOH pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , and resuspended in 100 m l H40 buffer . Cells were mixed with 5 m l miniprep DNA ( ~ 0 . 5 – 1 m g total ) and put on ice . Cells were then electroporated with two square waves of 350 V , 8 ms , 1 s apart using a Gene Pulser Xcell ( Biorad ) and immediately transferred to a Petri dish with SorMC buffer ( 15 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 2 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 50 m M MgCl 2 , 50 m M CaCl 2 , pH 6 . 0 ) supplemented with live Klebsiella pneumoniae at an OD 600 of 2 . Selection marker was added after 5 hr ( 10 m g / ml G418 or 100 m g / ml hygromycin ) . Image acquisition Lattice light sheet microscopy 3D images were acquired as described ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) , using a massively parallel array of coherently interfering beams comprising a non - diffracting 2D optical lat - tice as light sheet illumination focused by 0 . 65 NA objective for excitation ( Special Optics ) . This cre - ates a coherent structured light sheet that can be dithered to create uniform excitation in a 400 nm thick plane across the entire field of view determined by the length of the light sheet . In order to obtain the array of lattice light sheet , a binary spatial light modulator ( SXGA - 3DM , Forth Dimension Displays ) is placed conjugate to the sample plane , and a binarized version of the desired structured pattern at the sample is projected on the display . In the time - lapse dithered mode , 3D stacks were acquired either by moving the detection objective ( Nikon , CFI Apo LWD 25XW , 1 . 1 NA , 2 mm WD ) , which is synchronized with the scanning galvo mirror , or moving the sample by fast piezoelectric flex - ure stage ( Physik Instrumente , P - 621 . 1CD ) with 100 ~ 150 z planes , to have about 20 m m in z axis with respect to the detection objective . Exposure time was 5 or 10 msec per plane , for a total expo - sure time of ~ 1 s for one 3D stack and a 1 s pause was added between each time point to have time series data . Raw data was deconvolved via a 3D iterative Lucy - Richardson algorithm in Matlab ( The Mathworks , Natick , MA ) utilizing an experimentally measured point spread function . Spinning disk microscopy was performed on an Andor Revolution system with a Yokogawa CSU spinning disk confocal unit . The microscope was fitted with a 1 . 49 Plan Apo 100x oil immersion objective and an additional 1 . 2x magnification lens . GFP and mCherry signals were separated by a Veltman et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e20085 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 20085 19 of 24 Research article Cell Biology Tucam beam splitter and detected using two Andor iXon Ultra backlit EMCCD cameras with 16 m m pixel size . Z - scans were performed with the 1 . 5x optovar in place using 70 ms exposure per frame and a Z - spacing of 0 . 19 m m . Typically , 80 frames were collected from each camera in a total of 8 s . TIRF microscopy was performed using a Nikon N - STORM system fitted with a 1 . 49 Plan Apo 100x oil immersion objective and the 1 . 5x optovar in place . GFP and mCherry fluorescence signals were recorded sequentially on an Andor iXon Ultra backlit EMCCD camera . Confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica SP8 system using a 1 . 4 NA plan apo oil immer - sion objective and GFP / mCherry fluorescence was detected using two HyD detectors . All micros - copy was performed at room temperature . Image analysis General image handling , such as brightness / contrast adjustments and generation of kymographs was done using ImageJ ( NIH ) . 3D cellular fluorescence images were generated as follows . A Z - stack was recorded on a spinning disk microscope using previously indicated settings . The dataset was deconvolved with Huygens Professional software ( Scientific Volume Imaging ) using a calculated point spread function . The images presented are maximum intensity projections of the deconvolved dataset . Correlation between speed and membrane fluorescence intensity was analysed using Quimp11 ( www . warwick . ac . uk / quimp ) . Identification of membrane pixels and measuring their fluorescence intensity was done using a custom - written MATLAB ( The MathWorks ) script ( Supplementary file 1 and Source code 1 ) . Image sets that were used for quantification were taken from at least two independent transfec - tions . Only those cells with very low HSPC300 - GFP expression were included for analysis , as overex - pression dramatically reduces image contrast . For the quantification of SCAR fluorescence on the edge and centre of macropinocytic cups a paired 2 - tailed T - test was used in Figure 3B and D and a 2 - tailed T - test was used in Figure 6F . All lattice light sheet microscopy movies ( 1 – 7 and 12 – 13 ) show a maximum intensity projection of the fluorescence intensity . The F - actin marker LimE D coil is used in all images unless otherwise speci - fied . Images were deconvolved using a custom - written Richardson - Lucy algorithm . The maximum intensity projection was generated using Huygens software . Indicated time is in the min : sec format .
