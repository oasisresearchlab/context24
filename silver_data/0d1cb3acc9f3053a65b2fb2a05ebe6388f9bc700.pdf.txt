Skop Department of Genetics and Medical Genetics , University of Wisconsin – Madison , Madison , WI 53706 ABSTRACT The widely conserved Arp2 / 3 complex regulates branched actin dynamics that are necessary for a variety of cellular processes . In Caenorhabditis elegans , the actin cytoskel - eton has been extensively characterized in its role in establishing PAR asymmetry ; however , the contributions of actin to the maintenance of polarity before the onset of mitosis are less clear . Endocytic recycling has emerged as a key mechanism in the dynamic stabilization of cellular polarity , and the large GTPase dynamin participates in the stabilization of cortical polarity during maintenance phase via endocytosis in C . elegans . Here we show that disrup - tion of Arp2 / 3 function affects the formation and localization of short cortical actin filaments and foci , endocytic regulators , and polarity proteins during maintenance phase . We detect actin associated with events similar to early endosomal fission , movement of endosomes into the cytoplasm , and endosomal movement from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane , sug - gesting the involvement of actin in regulating processes at the early endosome . We also ob - serve aberrant accumulations of PAR - 6 cytoplasmic puncta near the centrosome along with early endosomes . We propose a model in which Arp2 / 3 affects the efficiency of rapid endo - cytic recycling of polarity cues that ultimately contributes to their stable maintenance . INTRODUCTION The generation of cell diversity in a eukaryotic organism relies on the asymmetric partitioning of cues into distinct cellular domains . The stable maintenance of these domains is necessary for many cell types to develop and function properly . The Caenorhabditis elegans one - celled embryo begins to polarize along the anterior – posterior axis just after fertilization ( Cuenca et al . , 2003 ; Goldstein and Macara , 2007 ) . In this system , the well - conserved PAR proteins distinguish the anterior end of the embryo from the posterior end . The anterior PAR complex , which is made up of PAR - 6 / PAR - 3 / PKC - 3 , localizes to the anterior cortex during the first cell cycle . PAR - 2 and PAR - 1 oc - cupy the posterior cortex . The cortical domains are maintained through the rest of the cell cycle and are necessary to regulate the pulling forces that generate the asymmetric first cell division . In C . elegans the formation of the PAR cortical domains occurs in two distinct phases : establishment and maintenance . The RhoA or - thologue RHO - 1 and the actin – myosin cytoskeleton participate in the establishment of polarity , in part by directing cortical flow ( Munro et al . , 2004 ; Motegi and Sugimoto , 2006 ; Cowan and Hyman , 2007 ) . The completion of the establishment phase is marked by pseudo - cleavage formation . CDC - 42 , another member of the Rho family of GTPases involved in regulating actin dynamics , is required specifi - cally for the maintenance of cell polarity ( Aceto et al . , 2006 ) . The mechanism for how CDC - 42 achieves this role is somewhat unclear . The widely conserved multisubunit complex Arp2 / 3 is crucial for the formation of branched actin networks ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ) . It associates with an existing “mother” filament and nucleates the growth of a new actin filament 70° from the existing filament ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ) . Whereas Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics regu - late polarity in many eukaryotic systems ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Monitoring Editor Francis A .

M . Shivas and A . R . Skop Molecular Biology of the Cell 2011 ) . As the maintenance phase progresses , the foci condense to a small area of the cortex and remain there until the cell divides . To determine whether upstream nucleation - promoting factors of Arp2 / 3 affected actin dynamics similarly , we depleted the WASp homologue WSP - 1 and the WAVE homologue WVE - 1 . Depletion of either protein singly did not cause defects in actin organization ( un - published data ) . WVE - 1 RNAi alone is only partially penetrant ( Patel et al . , 2008 ) , and so we instead disrupted function of the WAVE / SCAR complex by depleting GEX - 3 ( Xiong et al . , 2011 ) . gex - 3 en - codes a homologue of NAP1 / NCKAP1—a ligand of the small GTPase Rac1—and has been reported to affect actin dynamics involved in cell migration and tissue morphogenesis later in C . elegans development ( Soto et al . , 2002 ; Patel et al . , 2008 ) . We found that upon depletion of GEX - 3 , there was a similarly significant decrease in the number of cortical actin foci at the anterior through - out the maintenance phase ( Supplemental Figure S1 , A and B ; p values in the legend ) . These results are also similar to those re - ported previously ( Xiong et al . , 2011 ) . These data suggest that Arp2 / 3 and the WAVE / SCAR complex play a specific role in the for - mation and maintenance of short actin filaments and foci during the polarity maintenance phase . ARX - 2 is required for PAR - 2 maintenance In C . elegans , the role of actin dynamics in the maintenance of PAR asymmetry has not been well characterized . Therefore we sought to determine whether the disruption of actin foci formation would alter polarity cue localization . It was recently reported that ARX - 2 affects the localization of one of the posterior PAR proteins , PAR - 2 , specifically during the maintenance phase of polarity ( Xiong et al . , 2011 ) . We reached similar conclusions using a different analysis . Cortical Z - series projections revealed that in wild - type or control embryos expressing GFP – PAR - 2 ( Schonegg et al . , 2007 ) , PAR - 2 is recruited to the posterior cortex as the posterior end of the embryo begins smoothing . On average , 43 . 8 ± 4 . 28 % ( n = 5 embryos ) of the cortical area is occupied by GFP – PAR - 2 by pseudocleavage forma - tion ( Figure 1 , C and D , PN meeting − 4 : 00 ) . This area decreases slightly as the embryo progresses through the maintenance phase , occupying 39 . 78 ± 7 . 57 % ( n = 5 embryos ) of the total cortical area at pronuclear meeting and remaining steady through 4 : 00 min after pronuclear meeting ( Figure 1C ) . In arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos , the area occupied by GFP – PAR - 2 appears unaffected during establish - ment phase ; however , PAR - 2 expands beyond the typical domain during the maintenance phase to occupy almost 60 % of the total cortical area over the course of multiple time points ( Figure 1 , C and D ; wild type [ WT ] . n = 5 embryos ; arx - 2 RNAi , n = 5 embryos ; p val - ues in Figure 1D legend ) . However , before cell division , GFP – PAR - 2 retracts back to a normal cortical domain and the embryo divides asymmetrically , likely due to a rescue mechanism that takes place during mitosis ( Cai et al . , 2003 ; Siegrist and Doe , 2007 ; Schenk et al . , 2010 ) . These data suggest that ARX - 2 – mediated actin dynam - ics and associated regulatory factors play a role in preventing PAR - 2 expansion into the anterior domain during maintenance phase . ARX - 2 is required for CDC - 42 down - regulation during the maintenance phase We next examined the localization of GFP – CDC - 42 due to its in - volvement specifically in PAR maintenance ( Aceto et al . , 2006 ) . CDC - 42 is the C . elegans orthologue of Cdc42—a member of the Rho family of small GTPases that affect actin dynamics and cell po - larity ( Ridley , 2006 ) . We examined the cortex by generating cortical Z - series projections of wild - type and arx - 2 RNAi embryos express - ing GFP – CDC - 42 ( Motegi and Sugimoto , 2006 ) . In the wild - type Georgiou et al . , 2008 ; Leibfried et al . , 2008 ; Harris and Tepass , 2010 ) , the contributions of Arp2 / 3 to the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of polarity in the C . elegans embryo are less clear ( Severson and Bowerman , 2003 ; Xiong et al . , 2011 ) . It is well established that branched actin networks are required for endocytosis and recycling in budding yeast ( Smythe and Ayscough , 2006 ; Lanzetti , 2007 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Slaughter et al . , 2009 ) . The efficient function of endocytic processes reinforces the polarization of the Cdc42p cap , which specifies the bud site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Ayscough , 2000 ; Irazoqui et al . , 2005 ; Marco et al . , 2007 ; Slaughter et al . , 2009 ; Orlando et al . , 2011 ) . The requirements of actin in endocytosis and membrane trafficking in higher eukaryotes vary among organisms and cell types ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ; Taunton , 2001 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Smythe and Ayscough , 2006 ; Lanzetti , 2007 ; Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) , but the endocytic pathway is emerging as a conserved mech - anism necessary to stably maintain polarity in multicellular organ - isms ( Marco et al . , 2007 ; Georgiou et al . , 2008 ; Leibfried et al . , 2008 ; Nakayama et al . , 2009 ; Shivas et al . , 2010 ) . The contributions of ac - tin to endocytic processes required for the maintenance of polarity have not been determined in the C . elegans embryo . We report here that Arp2 / 3 is involved in the cortical localization and organization of several different factors during the polarity maintenance phase . In particular , the formation of short , punctate actin filaments is hampered upon disruption of Arp2 / 3 levels . Sub - sequently , CDC - 42 accumulates at the cortex , and the stable main - tenance of PAR asymmetry is disrupted . We also observe defects in the localization of endocytic proteins , including the large GTPase dynamin . Although endocytosis is not obviously affected , we ob - serve significantly larger early endosomes and accumulations of PAR - 6 in association with these enlarged endosomes . We propose that Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics plays a key role in the regula - tion of early endosome dynamics and in the rapid recycling of ante - rior polarity cues back to the cell cortex , which promotes the stabili - zation of PAR asymmetry before the onset of mitosis . RESULTS ARX - 2 is required for maintenance - phase actin dynamics To characterize the role of the Arp2 / 3 complex during the first cell cycle , we used feeding RNA interference ( fRNAi ) to deplete the lev - els of the C . elegans Arp2 orthologue ARX - 2 . We examined cortical Z - series projections of embryos expressing a green fluorescent pro - tein ( GFP ) – tagged fragment of moesin ( GFP - moe ) that labels fila - mentous actin ( Motegi et al . , 2006 ; Velarde et al . , 2007 ) . As previ - ously reported ( Velarde et al . , 2007 ) , control embryos expressing this construct show a meshwork of actin filaments during the establish - ment phase of polarity when the embryo is contracting to generate cortical flow ( Figure 1A ) . This meshwork retracts to the anterior half of the embryo during establishment phase . On completion of the establishment phase ( pseudocleavage ; Figure 1A ; pronuclear [ PN ] meeting − 4 : 00 [ times are in min : s ] ) , the actin meshwork breaks down into shorter filaments and foci that remain enriched at the anterior cortex ( Figure 1A , 0 : 00 PN meeting + 4 : 00 ; Velarde et al . , 2007 ) . In arx - 2 fRNAi - treated embryos , the actin meshwork looks similar to wild type during the polarity establishment phase ( Figure 1A ) . However , upon entering the maintenance phase , there are fewer actin foci at the cortex ( Figure 1A , 0 : 00 ) . Quantification of the num - ber of individual actin foci at PN meeting , PN meeting + 1 : 00 , and PN meeting + 4 : 00 revealed a significant reduction in the number of cortical actin puncta that form over these time points . ( Figure 1B ; p values in legend ) . A similar reduction in cortical actin foci upon de - pletion of ARX - 2 by fRNAi was previously reported ( Xiong et al . , Volume 23 May 15 , 2012 Arp2 / 3 promotes PAR recycling | 1919 ARX - 2 does not affect microtubule contacts with the cortex during the maintenance phase Microtubules affect cortical cell polarity in the C . elegans embryo ( Motegi et al . , 2006 ; Ai et al . , 2011 ; Xiong et al . , 2011 ) . Recently it was reported that ARX - 2 depletion affected microtubules , in that the fluorescence intensity of a tubulin marker , GFP – TBA - 2 , was re - duced at the centrosomes ( Xiong et al . , 2011 ) . However , it was un - clear whether arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos were actually deficient in microtubule – cortex contacts . To determine whether this was the case , we imaged a single cortical focal plane of a strain expressing EBP - 2 – GFP ( Srayko et al . , 2005 ) , a marker for the plus ends of micro - tubules . A single cortical focal plane was imaged , and the GFP - labeled cortical foci were counted every 5 s from PN meeting through 5 : 00 after PN meeting . In this analysis , we did not find sig - nificant differences in the total number of microtubule plus ends contacting the cortex in wild - type / control or arx - 2 RNAi - treated em - bryos . ( Figure 2 , A and B ; p values in legend ) . Although there may be some subtle microtubule defects at the centrosome , the obser - vation that the numbers of microtubule contacts with the cortex are unaffected suggests that the mislocalizations of cortical proteins are independent of microtubules . ARX - 2 is required for organization of endocytic proteins at the cortex Owing to the disruption of the formation and organization of actin foci specifically during the polarity maintenance phase , we were interested in determining whether the cortical organization of en - docytic machinery relied on ARX - 2 . In particular , we wanted to focus on the large GTPase dynamin . Dynamin has been exten - sively characterized in vesicle scission ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) , but we were also drawn to examine its localization based on previous data suggesting its importance in the formation of actin comets and other actin - based structures ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ; Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Schafer , 2002 , 2004 ; Krueger et al . , 2003 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Lanzetti , 2007 ) . As described previ - ously , DYN - 1 – GFP foci localize across the cortex before the onset of polarity establishment in wild - type embryos . The foci become enriched in the anterior and are maintained through cytokinesis ( Figure 2C , control ; Nakayama et al . , 2009 ) . In arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos , the number of DYN - 1 - GFP – labeled foci at the cortex is reduced significantly ( Figure 2 , C and D ; p values in legend ) . In addition , there is a reduction in the cytoplasmic background fluo - rescence observed . To determine whether the disruption in DYN - 1 – GFP foci to the cortex was specific to Arp2 / 3 - regulated actin dynamics , we again disrupted WAVE function through gex - 3 RNAi and quantified the number of DYN - 1 foci at the cortex ( Figure 2 , C and D ) . We found that disruption of WAVE / SCAR function by gex - 3 RNAi also significantly reduces the number of DYN - 1 – GFP cortical foci , similar to arx - 2 RNAi , suggesting that localization of DYN - 1 cortex relies on Arp2 / 3 and WAVE / SCAR - mediated actin dynamics . Similar to the phenotype observed in the arx - 2 RNAi treatment of moe - GFP – expressing embryos ( Figure 1A ) , the DYN - 1 – GFP foci also condense in a small area of the anterior cortex during the later stages of the polarity maintenance phase ( Figure 2C ; PN meeting + 4 : 00 ) . We next wanted to determine whether the actin foci and DYN - 1 – GFP foci were localizing to the same structures . To do so , we imaged a single cortical focal plane of embryos expressing DYN - 1 – GFP and moe - mCherry and found that 45 . 3 ± 4 . 6 % of the DYN - 1 – GFP foci overlapped with or were adjacent to small , corti - cal actin filaments and puncta in wild - type embryos at PN meeting ( n = 4 embryos ; Figure 2D ; Merrifield et al . , 1999 ; Lee and embryos , CDC - 42 localizes to long structures ( on average , 2 . 54 ± 1 . 59 μm in length ; n = 5 embryos ) at the cortex that become enriched at the anterior during the establishment phase ( Figure 1E , − 4 : 00 ; Motegi et al . , 2006 ) . CDC - 42 remains anteriorly localized through maintenance phase ; however , the area occupied at 4 : 00 after PN meeting is reduced . The foci are also significantly shorter , averaging 1 . 30 ± 0 . 69 μm in length ( Supplemental Figure S2A ; p values in legend ) . The reasons or mechanisms for the down - regu - lation of CDC - 42 levels at the cortex or the change in size during late maintenance phase are unknown . In arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos , the GFP - CDC - 42 – labeled struc - tures during establishment phase are shorter and more condensed than in controls , averaging 1 . 76 ± 1 . 05 μm in length ( Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure S2B ) . CDC - 42 still becomes enriched at the anterior end of the embryo and is maintained . In contrast to the con - trols , we observed little change in the length of the foci between es - tablishment and maintenance phase in arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos ( 1 . 63 ± 1 . 01 μm in length ; Supplemental Figure S2B ) . In terms of the cortical area , CDC - 42 occupies a greater area of the cortex 4 : 00 after PN meeting than in the controls ( Figure 1 , E and F ; p values in legend ; wild - type / control , n = 7 embryos ; arx - 2 RNAi , n = 7 embryos ) , indicat - ing that CDC - 42 dynamics are significantly disrupted . These data suggest that ARX - 2 - mediated maintenance of polarity extends be - yond the PARs , and that possibly an Arp2 / 3 - dependent mechanism is required for the down - regulation or removal of CDC - 42 from the cortex during the late stages of maintenance phase . ARX - 2 depletion causes PAR - 6 accumulations near the cortex To determine whether the appropriate localization of the anterior PAR complex also relied on Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics , we examined GFP – PAR - 6 localization in control and ARX - 2 – depleted embryos . As previously reported , GFPxPAR - 6 localizes to the ante - rior cortex during the establishment phase and is maintained there ( Munro et al . , 2004 ) . In the arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos , the cortical area occupied by GFP – PAR - 6 was somewhat reduced during the maintenance phase ; however , this was statistically significant only at the PN meeting + 1 : 00 time point ( Figure 1 , G and H ) , further sug - gesting that disruption of Arp2 / 3 leads to a destabilization of PAR asymmetry specifically during the maintenance phase . We also observed GFP - PAR - 6 – labeled foci at or near the anterior cortex during the establishment phase and earlier portions of the maintenance phase in wild - type embryos ( Figure 1G , + 4 : 00 ) . The nature of these puncta is unclear ; however , they appear to disperse or are removed from the cortex by 4 : 00 after pronuclear meeting . In embryos depleted of ARX - 2 , these foci appear to remain at or near the cortex longer than what was observed in wild - type embryos ( Figure 1G , + 4 : 00 ) and formed large aggregates similar to those ob - served in the moe - GFP background ( Figure 1A ) . We were interested in determining whether these GFP – PAR - 6 aggregates were associ - ated with the moe - GFP aggregates . To do so , we generated a strain expressing moe - mCherry and GFP – PAR - 6 . In control embryos in which a single cortical focal plane was imaged , there are instances in which GFP – PAR - 6 foci overlap with or are adjacent to moe - mCherry foci during the maintenance phase ( Figure 1I ) . At PN meeting , 39 . 5 ± 6 . 5 % of the PAR - 6 cortical foci were colocalized or partially colocal - ized with moe - mCherry foci ( n = 4 embryos ) . By 4 : 00 after PN meet - ing , however , many of the GFP – PAR - 6 foci are gone ( Figure 1I ) . We found that the larger GFP – PAR - 6 aggregates and moe - mCherry foci condensed to the same small cortical area in the arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos ( Figure 1J ) . These data suggest that Arp2 / 3 affects PAR - 6 dynamics during the polarity maintenance phase . 1920 | J . M . Shivas and A . R .

Later in the maintenance phase ( 4 : 00 after PN meeting ) , 73 . 9 ± 6 . 8 % of the DYN - 1 – GFP foci were colocalized with or adjacent to moe - mCherry – labeled foci ( n = 4 embryos ; Figure 2D , + 4 : 00 ) . In the arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos , the larger aggregates of actin and DYN - 1 – GFP appear to localize to a similar area , and in some cases overlap , during the maintenance phase ( Figure 2E ) . These data indicate that Arp2 / 3 is necessary to organize , and possibly recruit , dynamin to the cortex . Owing to the reduction and disorganization of DYN - 1 – GFP foci at the cortex , we were interested in determining whether arx - 2 RNAi led to a disruption in clathrin levels . We generated cortical Z - series projections of wild - type or control embryos expressing GFP – CHC - 1 ( Sato et al . , 2005 ) . In these embryos , there appeared to be little , if any , asymmetry in the localization of GFP - labeled foci ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) . In embryos depleted of ARX - 2 , however , there is a strong accumulation of GFP - labeled puncta at the anterior cortex ( Supple - mental Figure S3 ) . We also observe more “open” puncta in arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos than in wild - type or control embryos express - ing this construct . These “open” puncta might suggest delays in the constriction of clathrin - coated pits , which has been observed in as - sociation with disruption of actin dynamics in other systems ( Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . We observed the strong anterior accumulation at simi - lar time points as when we observed a decrease DYN - 1 cortical puncta , which suggested a possible disruption in endocytosis . ARX - 2 does not affect membrane internalization We next sought to determine whether the disruption in DYN - 1 – GFP localization to the cortex and the accumulation of GFP - labeled clathrin heavy chain correlated with a disruption in endocytosis . To do so , we assayed internalization of FM1 - 43 , a lipophilic fluorescent dye . We previously reported that a similar dye , FM2 - 10 , was inter - nalized largely from the anterior membrane in a dynamin - depen - dent manner during the maintenance phase ( Nakayama et al . , 2009 ) . In a blind analysis , we found that there was no significant difference in the overall number of vesicles internalized when ARX - 2 levels were decreased . There was also no difference in the asymmetry of internalization in control versus arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos labeled with the dye ( unpublished data ) . It is possible that depletion of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics does not participate in endocyto - sis at the internalization stage but perhaps affects the efficiency of endocytosis , which would not be reflected in our assay . ARX - 2 depletion causes cytoplasmic membrane aggregates We previously reported close association of RAB - 5 – GFP , a marker for early endosomes , and actin foci in the cytoplasm of fixed C . elegans zygotes labeled with phalloidin ( Nakayama et al . , 2009 ) . We were interested in examining this association in living cells . We imaged a single , mid - focal plane of embryos expressing moe - GFP and mCherry – RAB - 5 and examined the movement of endosomes relative to actin . We observed many RAB - 5 – positive endosomes moving away from the plasma membrane that coincided with the appearance of an actin focus ( Figure 3A , times + 0 : 56 through + 1 : 17 ) . Actin localized to the site of endosome entry in 94 . 4 ± 9 . 3 % of the movements ( n = 6 embryos ) . Of the endosomal entries we could detect , actin followed 58 . 4 ± 10 . 6 % of the endosomes into the cell ( n = 6 embryos ) . We also observed actin associated with endosome movement back toward the plasma membrane ( Figure 3B ; see also Supplemental Movie S3B ) . Actin was associated with the endosomes before movement back to the plasma membrane in 77 . 7 ± 34 . 4 % of recycling - like events ( n = 6 embryos ) . Finally , we could also detect what appeared to be endosomal fission events , similar to those reported in other systems ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) . Actin foci were associated with 97 . 2 ± 6 . 8 % of the endosomal fis - sion events ( Figure 3C and Supplemental Figure S4A , n = 7 em - bryos ; see also Supplemental Movie S3C ) . Therefore these data suggest that actin dynamics can affect several aspects of early en - dosome dynamics , including movement into the embryo , recycling , and fission . In our analysis of whether endocytosis was affected in ARX - 2 – depleted embryos , we found membrane aggregates near the plasma membrane of arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos ( Figure 3D , ar - rowheads ) . Such aggregates were not observed as frequently in the controls ( Figure 3D ) . We observed , on average , fewer than three cytoplasmic aggregates per embryo that were > 5 . 98 μm 2 at the PN meeting time point in control embryos ( n = 5 embryos ) . However , in arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos there were , on average , more than six aggregates > 5 . 98 μm 2 observed at PN meeting ( n = 7 embryos ) . The average size of the larger aggregates in control embryos was 11 . 4 μm 2 , as compared with 13 . 9 μm 2 in the arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos . Similar structures could be detected in arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos expressing GFP - tagged EEA - 1 ( 2xFYVE ) ( Figure 3E ) , a marker for early endosomes ( Andrews and Ahringer , 2007 ) . There - fore we sought to determine whether there were defects at other stages of the endocytic pathway . To determine the nature of the aggregates observed in the FM1 - 43 – labeled embryos , we labeled embryos expressing GFP – EEA - 1 ( 2xFYVE ) with the fluorescent membrane dye FM4 - 64 . In control embryos at PN meeting , we could detect examples of dye - labeled cytoplasmic “vesicles” that nearly overlapped with GFP – EEA - 1 ( 2XFYVE ) foci ( Supplemental Figure S4B ) . Similar to the control embryos labeled with FM1 - 43 , few large aggregates were detected in the control embryos labeled RNAi - treated embryos expressing GFP – PAR - 2 .

Arp2 / 3 has been reported to play a key role in specific recycling events at the early endosome in higher eukaryotes ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Puthenveedu et al . , 2010 ) . On the basis of the observation that early endosomes were enlarged at the same time that PAR - 6 occupied a smaller cortical area and condensed into punctate aggregates in time points ( Figure 3F ) . In arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos , the average area was similar to that in controls at PN meeting and at 1 : 00 after PN meeting ( Figure 3F ) . However , from 2 : 00 to 5 : 00 after PN meet - ing , the average endosome areas were significantly larger than in the controls , > 5 . 0 μm 2 , suggesting that ARX - 2 affects regulation of early endosome size and possibly trafficking associated with the early endosome . Of interest , the time points at which we observe enlarged endosomes coincides with when we observed greater dis - ruptions in polarity maintenance ( Figure 1 , C – H ) . We also examined control and arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos expressing a GFP - tagged marker for recycling endosomes , RAB - 11 , and found no obvious effect on the distribution or size of these structures ( unpublished data ) , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 is playing a specific role in early en - dosomal regulation . We hypothesize that the efficiency of early en - FIGURE 3 : Actin associated with early endosomal dynamics .

Skop Molecular Biology of the Cell can be detected when the pronuclei begin to move to the center of the embryo after meeting ( Figure 4B ; see also Supplemental Movie S4B control and arx - 2 RNAi ) . These accumulations are much larger than what is observed in the control embryos and appear to remain associated with RAB - 5 near the centrosome ( Figure 4B , + 3 : 09 to + 4 : 40 ) . During mitosis , the RAB - 5 – and PAR - 6 – posi - tive aggregates move rapidly toward the cortex ( Figure 4B , + 7 : 49 to + 9 : 20 ) . During the maintenance phase , there also appears to be an intense localization of RAB - 5 that remains associated with the centrosome more than that observed in controls ( Figure 4B ) . These data suggest that Arp2 / 3 - medi - ated actin dynamics affects the endocytic trafficking dynamics of PAR - 6 and early en - dosomes , possibly by regulating the nor - mally rapid recycling of PAR - 6 from early en - dosomal compartments back to the cortex to stabilize the size of the anterior domain . DISCUSSION Our observation of disruption in PAR asym - metry and actin dynamics during polarity maintenance phase is similar to recently re - ported data ( Xiong et al . , 2011 ) . The ratio of posterior to anterior PAR - 2 fluorescence intensity was significantly decreased in arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos , which matches our observation that PAR - 2 occupies a sig - nificantly greater cortical area . We also found a slight decrease in cortical area occupied by PAR - 6 that was significant 1 : 00 after PN meeting , as well as residual GFP – PAR - 6 foci near the cortex later in the maintenance phase . This suggests that there is , indeed , some disruption of PAR - 6 dynamics upon arx - 2 depletion . We suggest that this difference in observation might be due to examining the ratio of fluorescence intensities at the mid - focal plane as opposed to measuring the size of the PAR domains in cortical images , as we did in this study . We also report that CDC - 42 accumulates at the cortex during the maintenance phase when Arp2 / 3 dynamics is disrupted . Taken together , both studies clearly indicate a role for Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics in the stabilization of PAR asym - metry during the maintenance phase . These studies also differ in that we did not observe the same defects in microtubules as Xiong et al . ( 2011 ) . We observed that the number of microtubule plus ends that made contact with the cortex was similar in arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos and controls . These data suggest that although the centrosomes may be smaller ( Xiong et al . , 2011 ) , the ability of microtubules to contact the cortex is not af - fected when Arp2 / 3 function is disrupted . However , the most appar - ent difference in our study is our characterization of the dynamics of endocytic proteins and compartments in association with actin dy - namics . We showed that depletion of ARX - 2 leads to significant dis - ruptions in the recruitment and organization of different markers of the endocytic machinery at the cortex . Although we did not observe changes in amount or asymmetry of endocytosis , it is possible that in decreasing the levels of ARX - 2 the overall efficiency of the endo - cytic pathway is reduced . We hypothesize that this inefficiency then leads to the disruption of PAR asymmetry . When Arp2 / 3 function is altered , we found that early endosome dynamics is disrupted , and arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos , we were curious to see whether PAR - 6 remained associated with early endosomes aberrantly , possibly due to a failure in trafficking events at the early endosome . To this end , we generated a strain expressing GFP – PAR - 6 and mCherry – RAB - 5 . In control embryos expressing these constructs , GFP - PAR - 6 – labeled puncta can be detected in the cytoplasm throughout the cell cycle . We previously reported evidence suggesting these puncta were endocytic , as they frequently moved into the cyto - plasm from DYN - 1 - GFP – rich sites at the cortex ( Nakayama et al . , 2009 ) . In the cytoplasm of control embryos , the puncta appear to overlap partially with RAB - 5 – positive endosomes transiently ( Figure 4A , white arrow ) . In a single focal plane , we observed events of this nature six times per embryo , on average . We found that these adja - cent / partially overlapped PAR - 6 – and RAB - 5 – positive structures could be observed moving together for multiple frames . They typi - cally moved together for ∼ 30 s before separating , but more frequently it seemed that the structures drifted out of the focal plane and could therefore no longer be tracked . Longer associations could be de - tected as well , ranging from 70 to 98 s , although typically only one of these long associations was observed per embryo imaged in a single focal plane . Overall , 55 % of the cytoplasmic PAR - 6 structures were associated with RAB - 5 – positive endosomes for multiple time points , and these associations were rarely detected at the centrosomes . Of interest , 54 . 5 % of the cytoplasmic PAR - 6 puncta that we observed not associated with RAB - 5 – positive endosomes were observed in the posterior region of the cell ( n = 5 embryos ) . We also observed RAB - 5 – positive endosomes associated with the movement of large PAR - 6 puncta into the cytoplasm ( Figure 4A , i and ii , blue arrows ; see also Supplemental Movie Figure 4Aii ) . In the arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos , centrosomal aggregates of GFP – PAR - 6 FIGURE 4 : PAR - 6 accumulates near RAB - 5 – dense centrosomes in arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos .

Volume 23 May 15 , 2012 Arp2 / 3 promotes PAR recycling | 1925 taining single - cell polarity via localized recy - cling of polarity cues in yeast has been dis - cussed ( Irazoqui et al . , 2005 ; Slaughter et al . , 2009 ; Yamamoto et al . , 2010 ) , it has not been reported widely in higher eukaryotic systems . Defects in the rapid recycling of PAR - 6 from the early endosome seem to be the most likely cause of disruption in PAR cortical localization and PAR - 6 cytoplasmic accumulation , but we have not ruled out the possibility that inefficiencies at earlier stages of endocytosis could lead to the problems in recycling as well . Actin regulators have been reported to play a role in vesicle uncoating ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Galletta et al . , 2008 ; Galletta and Cooper , 2009 ) . Defects in cargo recycling have been attributed to failures in efficient vesicle uncoating ( Kim et al . , 2002 ; Galletta and Cooper , 2009 ) . Such a defect might explain the aberrant accumulations of PAR - 6 foci , CDC - 42 , and clathrin near the cortex and the accumulation of PAR - 6 and RAB - 5 at the centrosomes . Why would a cell internalize proteins only to recycle them soon after ? We hy - pothesize that the mechanism described here acts to dynamically correct the size of the established PAR domains before the on - set of mitosis , when the PAR proteins have been shown to diffuse rapidly ( Goehring et al . , 2011 ) . Models in yeast suggest that a balance among endocytosis , recycling , and diffusion is key for stabilizing asymmetrically localized factors such as Cdc42p ( Marco et al . , 2007 ; Slaughter et al . , 2009 ) , and ac - tin plays a central role in these processes ( Ayscough , 2000 ; Irazoqui et al . , 2005 ; Marco et al . , 2007 ; Slaughter et al . , 2009 ; Harris and Tepass , 2010 ; Orlando et al . , 2011 ) . In our study , we suggest that we dis - rupted this balance of mechanisms involved in maintaining the asymmetric localization of polarity cues by disrupting recycling and possibly reducing the efficiency of endocy - tosis . We propose a model in which the ac - tin foci observed at the cortex during the maintenance phase form in an Arp2 / 3 - dependent manner and play a role in the organization of the endocytic machinery at the cortex ( Figure 5 ) . They may also promote the efficiency of endocytosis , endosome movement away from the plasma membrane , and vesicle uncoating here . In the cy - toplasm , ARX - 2 – dependent actin foci colocalize with some RAB - 5 – positive early endosomes . Under conditions in which ARX - 2 lev - els are reduced , endosomal dynamics such as endosome fission and recycling of PAR - 6 are disrupted , causing aberrant trafficking to the centrosomal area and destabilization in the maintenance of cor - tically localized polarity cues . In conclusion , the data presented here suggest a mechanism in which Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics play a key role in regulating events during the maintenance phase , including endocytic recy - cling dynamics and organization . The ability of this pathway to func - tion efficiently reinforces the established PAR - 6 localization and overall PAR asymmetry before the embryo enters mitosis . Future cytoplasmic GFP - PAR - 6 aggregates accumulate near the anterior centrosome at the times at which PAR - 6 occupies a smaller cortical area . These PAR - 6 accumulations are associated with larger RAB - 5 – positive endosomes , leading us to conclude that Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics participates in the rapid recycling of internalized PAR - 6 back to the cortex during maintenance phase . Typically Rab4 is associated with the rapid recycling of cargo from the early endo - some ( Yudowski et al . , 2009 ) ; however , a Rab4 homologue has not been identified in C . elegans ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ) . Given that we observe RAB - 5 – positive foci moving from the cytoplasm back to the plasma membrane ( Figure 3B ) , it is possible that RAB - 5 is taking on a recycling role as well . The involvement of actin in the endocytic maintenance of polar - ity cues has been discussed in terms of many experimental systems ( Ayscough , 2000 ; Marco et al . , 2007 ; Georgiou et al . , 2008 ; Leibfried et al . , 2008 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Slaughter et al . , 2009 ; Harris and Tepass , 2010 ; Shivas et al . , 2010 ) . Although the role of actin in main - FIGURE 5 : Model for the maintenance of PAR asymmetry . Model proposed based on our observations and those of previous work . In wild - type embryos during the maintenance phase , actin ( yellow stars ) and dynamin ( blue squares ) associate at the cortex . Dynamin promotes the internalization of PAR - 6 ( green ) . PAR - 6 associates with early endosomes ( purple circles ) , which in some instances are associated with cytoplasmic actin foci . These actin foci appear to help regulate endosomal behaviors , such as endosome scission or recycling . Cytoplasmic puncta of PAR - 6 can then be rapidly recycled back to the cortex if necessary or possibly move on to other endocytic compartments . On disruption of Arp2 levels , PAR - 6 may not be internalized as efficiently , as indicated by the reduction in dynamin sites at the cortex . Early endosomes are significantly larger , possibly due to defects in endosome scission . PAR - 6 cytoplasmic accumulations are detected in association with large early endosome aggregates . Owing to the aberrant accumulation of cytoplasmic PAR - 6 in association with early endosomes , the balance between cortically localized PAR - 6 and PAR - 2 ( gray ) is disrupted . 1926 | J . M .

It also remains unclear how the anterior PAR complex is linked to the plasma membrane in this system and what role CDC - 42 plays in this . Determining this connection could answer the question of how these factors are targeted to their appropriate location , which would greatly clarify our model of how exactly asymmetrically localized proteins are stabilized in a dynamic environment . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES GFP fusions The following transgenic lines were used : N2 , JJ1579 ( GFP – PAR - 6 ; Munro et al . , 2004 ) , TH129 ( GFP – PAR - 2 ; Schonegg et al . , 2007 ) , SA131 ( GFP – CDC - 42 ; Motegi and Sugimoto , 2006 ) , PF100 ( GFP - moe ; Motegi et al . , 2006 ) , MAD3 ( DYN - 1b FL – GFP ; Nakayama et al . , 2009 ) , MAD21 ( DYN - 1 – GFP × mCherry – PAR - 6 ; Nakayama et al . , 2009 ) , JA1403 ( GFP – EEA - 1 ( 2X FYVE ; Andrews and Ahringer , 2007 ) , and TH66 ( EBP - 2 – GFP ; Srayko et al . , 2005 ) . All strains were main - tained at room temperature ( 22°C ) . Strains generated in this work : MAD36 ( moe - mCherry ; this work ) , MAD45 ( moe - mCherry × DYN - 1 – GFP ; this work ) , MAD43 ( moe - GFP × mCherry – RAB - 5 ; this work ; Audhya et al . , 2007 ) , MAD53 ( GFP – PAR - 6 × moe - mCherry ; Munro et al . , 2004 ; this work ) , and MAD60 ( GFP – PAR - 6 × RAB - 5 – mCherry ; Munro et al . , 2004 ; Audhya et al . , 2007 ) . To generate strains that express moe - mCherry , the moe frag - ment was amplified from a pFJ1 - based vector , pMOE ( Velarde et al . , 2007 ) , and then inserted into the Spe I site of pAA64 ( McNally et al . , 2006 ) . The primers used for amplification of moe are sense primer , 5 ′ - AGACCACATGGTCCTTCTTGAG - 3 ′ , and antisense primer , 5 ′ - AAAGAGAGGGGGTGAGTGGAT - 3 ′ . The resulting vector con - tains a 5 . 7 - kb genomic fragment of unc - 119 and a fragment coding the actin - binding domain of moesin fused to N - terminus of GFP ; GFP fusions are driven by the pie - 1 promoter . This vector ( pJMS06 moe - mCherry in pAA64 ) was bombarded into the unc - 119 strain , and movers were isolated and assayed for fluorescence . RNA interference For the arx - 2 fRNAi experiments , the arx - 2 gene was obtained from the Ahringer RNAi feeding library ( Kamath et al . , 2003 ) . Knockdown of gene function was performed using RNA feeding methods ( Kamath and Ahringer , 2003 ) . The temperature for fRNAi treatments was 25°C for 22 – 30 h . Live imaging and analysis of GFP fluorescence Embryos were dissected in egg salt buffer ( 118 mM NaCl , 40 mM KCl , 3 . 4 mM CaCl 2 , 3 . 4 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - pip - erazineethanesulfonic acid , pH 7 . 2 ; Munro et al . , 2004 ) and mounted on a 2 % agarose pad in egg buffer , and a 22 × 22 mm coverslip was placed on top and sealed with Vaseline . GFP time - lapse video im - ages were captured using a motorized microscope ( Axioplan II ; Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with a spinning disk confocal scan head ( QLC100 ; VisiTech , Sunderland , United Kingdom ) . The motor - ized filter turret and focus , external shutters , and a 12 - bit camera ( Orca ER ; Hamamatsu , Hamamatsu , Japan ) were controlled using OpenLab software ( Improvision , PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) . For cortical time - lapse imaging , we collected a Z - series of 2 frames per time point , and converted each Z - series into a single image by maxi - mum projection . Image processing was done with Photoshop ( Adobe , San Jose , CA ) or ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank A . Audhya , B . Goldstein , B .

This work was sup - ported by National Institutes of Health K01 Research Career Devel - opment Award K01HL092585 and the Louis and Elsa Thomsen Wis - consin Distinguished Graduate Fellowship . FM dye imaging For wild - type membrane dynamics , embryos were mounted on uncoated coverslips in hanging drops containing 1 μg / ml FM1 - 43 ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) in egg salts . Fluores - cence was captured with a 488 - nm argon laser and 520 - nm emis - sion filter . Quantification For cortical area occupied , background fluorescent signals other than the major foci were removed by setting a threshold value that minimized background fluorescence in regions devoid of GFP signal or foci . The areas of fluorescence above the threshold value in each anterior and posterior region were measured using the Percent Area measurement in the ImageJ measurement tools . To quantify the number of microtubule contacts made with the cortex , the embryos expressing EBP - 2 – GFP were imaged every 5 s . The number of foci at the cortex were counted manually every 5 s for a total of 60 s . The numbers of foci at each time point were summed to obtain the num - ber of contacts / minute . To quantify the number of DYN - 1 – GFP foci at the cortex , background fluorescence was subtracted in each corti - cal Z - series projection using the ImageJ Subtract Background func - tion . A threshold was set such that the DYN - 1 – GFP foci were high - lighted , and background fluorescence that remained was minimally detected . The foci were analyzed using Analyze Particles in ImageJ with a cutoff of 5 pixels 2 . To quantify the endosome area , a threshold was set so that all of the FM1 - 43 – labeled or RAB - 5 – labeled endo - somes in the focal plane were highlighted and the background fluo - rescence recognized was minimal . Using the Analyze Particles func - tion in ImageJ , we measured the area of the highlighted endosomes by setting a cutoff of 30 pixels 2 for FM1 - 43 to determine how fre - quently larger - than - average endosomes were observed in controls and arx - 2 RNAi - treated embryos and 10 pixels 2 for RAB - 5 to deter - mine the average endosome size at each time point . Statistical analysis The quantified values were compared between wild - type / control and arx - 2 fRNAi - treated embryos . An F test was used to compare the vari - ance between subjects before applying the t test . When the variance was equal , Student’s t test ( two tails ) was used to analyze the differ - ence between wild - type and arx - 2 fRNAi - treated embryos . When the variances were unequal , Welch’s t test was used . The statistical tests were done using Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA ) . p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant .
