This study demon - strates that highly conserved Amblyomma americanum tick saliva serpin 19 ( AAS19 ) , a broad - spectrum inhibitor of hemostasis and in ﬂ ammation system proteases and anticoagulant , can bind heparan sul - fate / heparin ( HS ) GAGs and that this interaction alters its function . Substrate hydrolysis and unpaired t - test analyses revealed that HSGAG binding caused rAAS19 inhibitory activity to : ( i ) signi ﬁ cantly in - crease against blood clotting factors ( f ) IIa ( thrombin ) and fIXa , ( ii ) signi ﬁ cantly reduce against fXa and fXIIa and ( iii ) moderate to no effect against trypsin , kallikrein , papain , and plasmin . Stoichiometry of inhibition ( SI ) analyses show that HSGAG binding improved the rAAS19 inhibitory ef ﬁ ciency against thrombin 2 . 7 e 4 . 3 fold as revealed by SI change from 13 . 19 in absence of HSGAGs to 4 . 83 e 3 . 04 in their presence . Our data show that HSGAG binding dramatically enhanced rAAS19 anticoagulant function . In the recalci ﬁ cation time assay , rAAS19 pre - incubated with HSGAGs prior to the assay , delayed plasma clotting by an additional 176 e 457 s above HSGAGs or rAAS19 alone . Our data suggest that formation of the HSGAGs and rAAS19 complex is important for the observed enhanced anticoagulant effect . Delay of plasma clotting was higher when HSGAGs and rAAS19 were co - incubated to allow complex formation prior to blood clotting assay as opposed to no co - incubation . We have discussed our ﬁ nding with reference to tick feeding physiology and utility of the rAAS19 in blood clotting disorder therapy . © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd . 1 . Introduction Hard ticks such as Amblyomma americanum are successful ec - toparasites because of their immense capacity to evade the host ' s defense response to tick feeding . The tick feeding style of lacerating host tissue and sucking up host blood should provoke host defenses that are aimed at stopping further blood loss . To successfully feed and transmit disease agents , ticks inject numerous pharmacologi - cally active compounds into the feeding site to evade host defenses ( Ribeiro and Francischetti , 2003 ) . The host ' s defense responses to tick feeding include hemostasis , complement activation , and in ﬂ ammation , all of which are primarily serine protease mediated under tight control of serine protease inhibitors ( serpins ) . Numerous human diseases caused by serpin malfunction further validate the importance of this family of proteins ( Brouwer et al . , 2009 ; Cui et al . , 2014 ; Davis et al . , 1999 ; Egeberg , 1965 ; Eriksson , 1964 ; Kubo et al . , 2013 ) . On this basis , it was hypothesized that ticks could inject serpins into the feeding site to thwart host de - fense ( Mulenga et al . , 2001b ) . Multiple serpin encoding cDNAs have been identi ﬁ ed in several tick species , including A . americanum ( Mulenga et al . , 2001a , 2003 , 2007 , 2009 ; Porter et al . , 2015 ; Sugino et al . , 2003 ; Tirloni et al . , 2014 ) . In proposing that ticks utilize serpins to evade host defenses , the assumption is that ticks inject functional inhibitory serpins into the feeding site . Tick saliva proteomes ( Kim et al . , 2016b ; Tirloni et al . , 2015 ) , immunoproteomes ( Lewis et al . , 2015 ; Radulovi (cid:3) c et al . , 2014 ) , and western blotting analysis approaches ( Chalaire et al . , 2011 ; Ibelli et al . , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ) have con ﬁ rmed that ticks do inject serpins into animals during feeding . Several studies have established that some tick saliva serpins have inhibitory * Corresponding author . E - mail address : amulenga @ cvm . tamu . edu ( A . Mulenga ) .

Other studies have shown that some of tick saliva serpins can delay blood clotting ( Ibelli et al . , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ; Mulenga et al . , 2013 ) , prevent platelet aggregation ( Chmelar et al . , 2011 ; Ibelli et al . , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ; Mulenga et al . , 2013 ) , and block in ﬂ ammation ( Prevot et al . , 2009 ) and host immune response ( Palenikova et al . , 2015 ) . Important serpin regulators of the mammalian blood clotting system , antithrombin III , protein C inhibitor , and heparin cofactor II need to bind glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) to achieve physiologically relevant rates of activity ( Berliner , 2012 ; Pratt and Church , 1992 ; Rein et al . , 2011 ; Tollefsen , 1997 ) . In other serpins such as the a 1 - antitrypsin and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 , GAG binding inhibits their inhibitory functions ( Carrell , 2016 ; Ehrlich et al . , 1991 ) . We recently described highly conserved A . americanum serine protease inhibitor 19 ( AAS 19 ) that is characterized by its functional domain being 100 % conserved across different hard tick species ( Porter et al . , 2015 ) . We showed that this protein was injected into the host during tick feeding , and that Pichia pastoris expressed recombinant ( r ) AAS19 was a broad - spectrum inhibitor of hemostasis and in ﬂ ammation system proteases with anti - hemostatic functions ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . In another study target validation by RNAi silencing and immunization affected tick ﬁ tness , prevented successful tick feeding , and female ability to lay eggs ( Kim et al . , 2016a ) . Comparative modeling predicted four basic patches on AAS19 tertiary structure ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) that were similar to functionally validated GAG binding sites in mammalian serpins ( Huntington , 2013 ; Koide , 1993 ; Pratt and Church , 1993 ) . The goal of this study was to determine if putative AAS19 GAG binding sites were functional , and if so , to determine the effect of this interaction on rAAS19 function . We report that rAAS19 binds heparan sulfate / heparin ( HS ) GAGs and that this interaction altered the inhibitory pro ﬁ le and enhanced the anticoagulant function of rAAS19 . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Validation of AAS19 GAG binding sites Expression and af ﬁ nity puri ﬁ cation of rAAS19 was previously described ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Comparative modeling predicted four GAG binding sites on AAS19 ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . To determine if putative AAS19 GAG binding sites were functional , ~ 100 m g of af - ﬁ nity puri ﬁ ed rAAS19 was bound and eluted on HiTrap Heparin HP Column according to instructions by the manufacturer ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences , Uppsala , Sweden ) using 10 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 as binding and 10 mM sodium phosphate , 2 M sodium chloride , pH 7 as eluting buffer . All column fractions were concentrated using the Microsep Advance Centrifugal Devices with 10 K MWCO ﬁ lters ( Pall Life Sciences , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) . On the same column , eluting fractions were desalted and buffer exchanged to binding buffer . Fractions as well as pre - column rAAS19 were subjected to western blotting analysis using the antibody to the C - terminus histidine tag ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Pos - itive signal was detected using a BioFX chemiluminescent reagent ( SurModics , Eden Prairie , MN , USA ) . 2 . 2 . Effect of HSGAG binding on protease inhibitor activity of AAS19 Proteases , peptide substrates and the methods described else - where ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) were used with slight modi ﬁ cation : sub - strate hydrolysis was optimized at 37 (cid:1) C as opposed to 33 (cid:1) C . We used four commercially available HSGAGs : heparan sulfate ( HS ) ( Galen Laboratory Supplies , Middletown , CT , USA ) , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH , the main fraction 3 e 5 KDa , Fisher Scien - ti ﬁ c ) , medium molecular weight heparin ( MMWH , ~ 10 KDa , J . T . Baker , Center Valley , PA , USA ) , and high molecular weight hep - arin ( HMWH , 17 e 19 KDa , Sigma - Aldrich ) . The assay was done in four steps . In the ﬁ rst step we determined the lowest effective protease concentration ( Table 1 ) . In the second step , we screened inhibitoryactivity of 1 m M rAAS19 in presence of HSGAGs to identify proteases that were sensitive ( Table 1 ) . In the third step , we determined the molar ratio of rAAS19 ( I ) to target protease ( E ) for which in absence of HSGAGs less than 80 % inhibition of target enzyme activity was observed ( Table 2 ) . In the fourth step we conducted substrate hydrolysis in presence of HSGAGs . For each protease ( Table 2 ) rAAS19 was pre - incubated with HSGAG ( ﬁ nal concentrations : 5 ng / m L for HS , 10 ng / m L for LMWH and MMWH , and 20 ng / m L for HMWH ) for 5 min at 37 (cid:1) C in the reaction buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % BSA , pH 7 . 4 ) . Subsequently the protease was added to the reaction , followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 (cid:1) C . Following incubation , appropriate substrates ( Table 1 ) were added and substrate hydrolysis was monitored at A 405nm every 30 s for 30 min at 37 (cid:1) C using the BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader ( BioTek , Winooski , VT , USA ) . Data were ﬁ t onto the Michaelis - Menten kinetics equation to plot progress curves and determine residual enzyme activity or maximum velocity ( V max ) in Prism 6 software ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . With background removed , the % enzyme activity inhibition of rAAS19 with or without HSGAGs was calculated using this formula : 100 (cid:3) [ V max ( TPB or TPE ) / V max ( PC ) ] (cid:4) 100 , where TPB , TPE , and PC repre - sent residual enzyme activity of protease þ rAAS19 þ substrate without or with HSGAGs and HSGAG þ protease þ substrate Table 1 Listof proteases and their substrates used in substrate hydrolysisassays .

Mean ( M ) ± SEM % inhibition levels of three separate runs are reported . Mean ( M ) ± SEM % TPB was calculated from a combined twelve runs . Differences between TPB and TPE mean % enzyme activity inhibition levels determined the effect of HSGAG binding on rAAS19 inhibitory function . Positive or negative values denoted enhancement or decrease of rAAS19 inhibitory activity respectively in presence of HSGAGs . The statis - tical signi ﬁ cance of HSGAG binding on rAAS19 inhibitory function was validated using unpaired t - test with Welch ' s correction in Prism 6 software ( GraphPad Software ) . 2 . 3 . Stoichiometry of inhibition ( SI ) In preliminary analysis , we observed that the effect of HSGAG binding signi ﬁ cantly enhanced the rAAS19 inhibitory activity against factor ( f ) IIa ( thrombin ) . To gauge insight on the effect of HSGAG binding on rAAS19 inhibitory activity ef ﬁ ciency , we deter - mined SI indices for thrombin with and without HSGAGs , as described ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Various concentrations of rAAS19 ( 0 , 6 . 81 , 13 . 62 , 20 . 44 , 27 . 25 , 40 . 87 , and 54 . 5 nM ) were pre - incubated with HSGAGs ( ﬁ nal concentrations indicated above ) for 15 min at 37 (cid:1) C in the reaction buffer , followed by addition of thrombin in the ﬁ nal concentration of 27 . 25 nM . Reactions werefurther incubated at 37 (cid:1) C for 3 h . Colorimetric substrate ( 200 m M , Table 1 ) was then addedtoa ﬁ nal reactionvolumeof 100 m L . Residual protease activity was determined by measuring A 405nm every 30 s for 30 min at 37 (cid:1) C . Data were analyzed using the Michaelis - Menten kinetics equation in Prism 6 software to determine V max . V max in presence of various rAAS19 concentrations were expressed as percentage of PC . To es - timate SI ( x ¼ SI when y ¼ 0 ) , a linear regression line was ﬁ t to V max ( y - axis ) versus I : E molar ratio [ x - axis , rAAS19 ( I ) : enzyme ( E ) ] . All I : E molar ratio with V max higher than 10 % were included in the analysis . 2 . 4 . Effect of HSGAG binding on rAAS19 anti - coagulation function The effect of HSGAG binding on rAAS19 anti - coagulation func - tion was assessed using recalci ﬁ cation time , activated partial thromboplastin time , and prothrombin time assays in two steps . In the ﬁ rst step , we determined the lowest effective anti - coagulant dosage of rAAS19 and HSGAGs . To determine the lowest effective anti - coagulant dosages , various amounts of rAAS19 ( ﬁ nal concen - trations 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , and 4 m M ) and HSGAGs ( 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 ng / m L ) were used in recalci ﬁ cation time , activated partial thromboplastin time , and prothrombin time assays as previously described ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . In the second step , we used the lowest effective anti - coagulant dosages to determine the effect of HSGAG binding on rAAS19 anticoagulation function . In the recalci ﬁ cation time assay , we mixed the lowest effective anti - coagulant dosage of rAAS19 ( 2 m M ) and 0 . 5 ng / m L for each of the HSGAGs in 40 m L of 20 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 buffer and incubated for 5 min at 37 (cid:1) C , prior to adding 50 m L of pre - warmed universal coagulation reference plasma . Reactions were further incubated at 37 (cid:1) C for 15 min . Control reactions included rAAS19 , or HSGAG the lowest effective anti - coagulant dosages , or buffer only , that were pre - incubated at for 5 min at 37 (cid:1) C prior to the addition of universal coagulation reference plasma for each assay . Adding CaCl 2 triggered plasma clotting and was monitored at A 650nm every 20 s for 20 min using the BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader ( BioTek ) . In preliminary analysis , we observed that pre - incubation of rAAS19 with HSGAGs substantially delayed plasma clotting above rAAS19 or HSGAGs alone . We were curious to investigate whether or not the pre - incubation step was necessary . To clarify , an additional control re - action was performed , with rAAS19 and HSGAGs pre - incubated separately with universal coagulation reference plasma and com - bined just before addition of CaCl 2 to trigger clotting .

Controls containing rAAS19 , HSGAGs , or buffer only were included . All assays were performed in triplicate . For all assays , data analysis was ﬁ t onto sigmoid line in Prism 6 . Initiation of plasma clotting was interpolated from the sigmoid line when A 650nm increased by 10 % , with 95 % con ﬁ dence interval . Dif - ferences in plasma clotting time between treatment ( rAAS19 and HSGAG pre - incubated together ) and controls , quanti ﬁ ed in seconds the effect of HSGAG binding on rAAS19 anticoagulant function . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Recombinant AAS19 binds heparin Fig . 1 validates that putative GAG binding sites predicted on AAS19 comparative tertiary structure ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) are func - tional . Fig . 1 shows that rAAS19 bound onto heparin in that rAAS19 was detected in run - through ( lane 3 ) and elution ( lane 5 ) fractions , but not in wash fraction ( lane 4 ) . 3 . 2 . HSGAG binding alters rAAS19 inhibitory pro ﬁ le Data summarized in Table 2 , Figs . 2 and 3 show that HSGAG binding had three effects on rAAS19 inhibitory function : ( i ) enhancement ( blood clotting factors thrombin and fIXa ) , ( ii ) inhi - bition ( blood clotting factors fXa and fXIIa ) , and ( iii ) moderate to no effect ( kallikrein , papain , trypsin , and plasmin ) , while effects on fXIa were inconclusive . Unpaired t - test analysis demonstrated that rAAS19 ( 100 nM ) inhibitoryactivity against thrombin ( 27 . 1 nM ) was signi ﬁ cantly enhanced from 49 . 2 ± 3 . 5 % in absence of HSGAGS to 88 . 2 ± 4 . 0 ( p ¼ 0 . 0004 ) , 82 . 8 ± 5 . 1 ( p ¼ 0 . 0303 ) , 90 . 1 ± 1 . 2 ( p ¼ 0 . 0053 ) , and 74 . 0 ± 4 . 5 % ( p ¼ 0 . 0083 ) when bound with HS , LMWH , MMWH , and HMWH respectively ( Fig . 2A , Table 2 ) . For fIXa ( 31 . 44 nM ) , binding LMWH and MMWH signi ﬁ cantly enhanced rAAS19 ( 1 m M ) inhibitory activity from 43 . 1 ± 1 . 9 % in absence of HSGAGs to respectively 55 . 7 ± 2 . 8 ( p ¼ 0 . 0047 ) and 55 . 9 ± 2 . 6 % ( p ¼ 0 . 0129 ) , while binding HMWH and HS also showed enhance - ment but not statistically signi ﬁ cant ( Fig . 2B ) . On the other hand , binding of HSGAGs signi ﬁ cantly suppressed rAAS19 ( 40 nM ) in - hibitor functions against fXa ( 4 . 65 nM ) , which dropped from 75 . 3 ± 4 . 3 % in absence of HSGAGs to 17 . 4 ± 2 . 6 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , 17 . 4 ± 2 . 2 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , 17 . 8 ± 1 . 5 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , and 19 . 4 ± 2 . 0 % ( p < 0 . 0001 ) in presence of HS , LMWH , MMWH , and HMWH , respectively ( Fig . 2I ) . Similarly , HSGAG binding suppressed rAAS19 ( 1 m M ) inhibitory activity against fXIIa ( 2 . 03 nM ) from 76 . 7 ± 1 . 3 % in absence of HSGAGs to 50 . 6 ± 1 . 8 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , 35 . 9 ± 0 . 7 ( p ¼ 0 . 0001 ) , 49 . 9 ± 4 . 6 ( P ¼ 0 . 0216 ) , and 36 . 8 ± 6 . 2 % ( p ¼ 0 . 0199 ) in presence of HS , LMWH , MMWH , and HMWH , respectively ( Fig . 2H ) . The effects of HSGAG binding had mixed , or minimal to no effect against kallikrein , trypsin , papain , and plasmin , or results were inconclu - sive as in the case of fXIa ( Fig . 2D e G ) . Fig . 3 summarizes the effect of HSGAG binding on inhibitory activity of rAAS19 as revealed by differences in mean % enzyme activity inhibition between reactions with and without HSGAGs . Supplemental ﬁ le S - 1 summarizes progress curves of data summarized in Table 2 , Figs . 2 and 3 . 3 . 3 . HSGAG binding improves rAAS19 inhibitory ef ﬁ ciency against thrombin as revealed by SI In Figs . 2 and 3 we observed that HSGAG binding dramatically ampli ﬁ ed rAAS19 inhibitory functions against thrombin . To gauge insight into whether this is translated to the increased rAAS19 inhibitory ef ﬁ ciency we determined SI indices against thrombin ( Fig . 4A e J ) in presence of different HSGAGs . As shown in Fig . 4 , the inhibitoryef ﬁ ciency of rAAS19 against thrombin improved ~ 2 . 7 fold from a SI index of 13 . 19 in absence of HSGAGs ( Fig . 4A and F ) to 4 . 83 when bound to HS ( Fig . 4B and G ) and ~ 4 . 1 , 3 . 9 , and 4 . 3 fold when bound to LMWH ( Fig . 4C and H ) , MMWH ( Fig . 4D and I ) , and HMWH ( Fig . 4E and J ) , respectively . 3 . 4 . HSGAG binding enhances rAAS19 anticoagulant function The recalci ﬁ cation time assay summarized in Fig . 5 , demonstrate that the anticoagulant effects of rAAS19 in complex with any of the four HSGAGs ( Te in Fig . 5 ) was superior to rAAS19 ( Tb in Fig . 5 ) or any of the four HSGAGs ( Tc in Fig . 5 ) alone . It is interesting to note that when we pre - bound rAAS19 with HS , LMWH , MMWH , and HMWH , plasma clotting was delayed for an additional 176 e 457 s above HSGAGs or rAAS19 alone ( Fig . 5A e D and accompanying table inserts ) . Another interesting observation from our data is that pre - incubating rAAS19 with HSGAGs together presumably to allow for the complex to form prior to the recalci ﬁ cation time assay was important for the observed enhanced delay of plasma clotting . Plasma clotted faster in reactions where we pre - incubated rAAS19 and HSGAGs separately with plasma ( Td in Fig . 5 ) and mixed just before triggering clotting as opposed to reactions in which rAAS19 and HGAGs were pre - incubated together prior to triggering clotting ( Te in Fig . 5 ) . As shown in the table inserts Te reactions delayed plasma clotting for an additional 63 e 216 s above Td reactions . In the recalci ﬁ cation time assay , ﬁ rmness of the clot corresponded to higher optical density ( A ) . It is interesting to note that the ﬁ nal A 650nm read outs were apparently lower when rAAS19 was mixed with HSGAGs ( e in Fig . 5 ) in comparison with control reactions ( a - d in Fig . 5 ) . Under conditions of the assay in this study , pre - binding rAAS19 with HSGAGs did not have any effects on plasma clotting time in the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time blood clotting assays .

Discussion This study was prompted by functional analysis data that showed that rAAS19 was a functional inhibitory serpin and anti - coagulant that was predicted to have putative GAG binding sites ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Key regulatory serpins in the mammalian blood clotting system such as antithrombin III , heparin cofactor II , and protein C inhibitor bind GAGs to achieve physiological inhibitory rates against target proteases ( Berliner , 2012 ; Pratt and Church , 1993 ; Tollefsen , 1997 ) . We were curious to investigate if putative GAG biting sites on AAS19 tertiary structure ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) were functional , and if so , the effect of this interaction on rAAS19 inhibitory and anticoagulant functions . Our data demonstrate that rAAS19 binds HSGAGs and this interaction alters the inhibitory pro ﬁ le and enhances the anticoagulant function of rAAS19 . Preventing host blood from clotting is the major tick Fig . 2 . Effect of HSGAG binding on rAAS19 inhibitor function pro ﬁ le . We pre - incubated rAAS19 with or without HSGAGS at 37 (cid:1) C for 5 min prior to addition of appropriate proteases and further 15 min incubation at the same temperature . Subsequently , speci ﬁ c colorimetric substrates at optimized concentrations were added and hydrolysis was monitored as described . Control reactions containing protease þ rAAS19 þ substrate without HSGAGs ( TPB ) , protease þ HSGAG þ substrate without rAAS19 ( PC ) , and HSGAG þ rAAS19 þ substrate ( background ) were included . Data were ﬁ t to Michaellis - Menten kinetics equation in PRISM 6 to determine V max or residual enzyme activity . With background removed , % enzyme activity inhibition of rAAS19 in presence ( TPE ) or absence of HSGAGs was calculated using this formula : 100 (cid:3) [ V max ( TPB or TPE ) / V max ( PC ) ] (cid:4) 100 . Mean ( M ) ± SEM % enzyme activity inhibition of three separate runs are reported , except for TPB , which was calculated froma combined twelve runs . Unpaired t - test in Prism 6 was used to determine statistical signi ﬁ cance between TPB and TPE treatments . ND - not de ﬁ ned . * - statistically signi ﬁ cant difference between TPB and TPE . (cid:1) Z . M . Radulovi (cid:3) c , A . Mulenga / Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 80 ( 2017 ) 1 e 10 5 accomplishment for the simple reason that if blood clots , the tick will starve . The blood - clotting cascade is classi ﬁ ed in three path - ways : the initiation or tissue factor ( classically known as extrinsic ) , the consolidation or ampli ﬁ cation ( classically called intrinsic ) , and the common pathway when the ﬁ brin clot forms to seal off the blood vessel damage ( Versteeg et al . , 2013 ; Walsh and Ahmad , 2002 ) . Blood clotting factors have been grouped into those that regulate the initiation ( fVa , fVIIa , fIXa , and fXa ) , the consolidation ( thrombin , fVIIIa , fXIa , and fXIIa ) , and the common pathways ( thrombin , fVa , and fXa ) ( Versteeg et al . , 2013 ) . The observation that two blood clotting factors , thrombin and fIXa against which HSGAG binding signi ﬁ cantly enhanced rAAS19 inhibitory activity play roles in each of three parts of the blood clotting pathway , suggest that native AAS19 interferes with the blood clotting system at all levels . This may explain the signi ﬁ cant delay in plasma clotting time that was observed in the recalci ﬁ cation time assay . Unlike mammalian serpins for which GAG binding either en - hances or blocks inhibitory function of a candidate serpin ( Berliner , 2012 ; Carrell , 2016 ; Ehrlich et al . , 1991 ) , HSGAG binding had dichotomous effect on rAAS19 inhibitory pro ﬁ le . In absence of HSGAGs , rAAS19 inhibited enzyme activity of 11 mammalian serine proteases to variable degrees ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) and papain in this study . However in presence of HSGAGs rAAS19 inhibitory activity was enhanced against thrombin and fIXa , inhibited against fXIIa and fXa , and had minimal or no effect against trypsin , plasmin , kallikrein , and papain enzyme activities . Given that native AAS19 protein is injected into the host during tick feeding ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) , it is likely that this protein will bind mammalian HSGAGs at the feeding site . On this basis , we speculate that native AAS19 is a likely inhibitor of thrombin , fIXa , fXIa , kallikrein , trypsin - , and papain - like proteases . HSGAGs are present on the surface of endothelial cells , which coat blood vessels and other cavities of cardiovascular system ( Rosenberg et al . , 1997 ) . It is likely that native AAS19 bind HSGAGs on cell and host tissue as way of localizing its effects to the tick - feeding site . It is important to note here that there are some discrepancies in rAAS19 inhibitory activity between this study and our previous study ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Previously we reported lower rAAS19 % enzyme activity inhibition level against thrombin than in this study . Reasons for this discrepancy could be explained by the fact that in this study we used signi ﬁ cantly less amount of thrombin in comparison to previous study ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . We believe that this translated to high rAAS19 excesses and thus high inhibitory levels reported here . Additionally substrate hydrolysis assays in this study were optimized at 37 (cid:1) C as opposed to 33 (cid:1) C in previous paper ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . We would like to note here that the observed rAAS19 inhibitory activity against thrombin in this study is close to that of its homolog in Rhipicephalus microplus , RmS - 15 , which was reported to inhibit thrombin with SI of 1 . 5 ( Xu et al . , 2016 ) . The observation in this study that HSGAG binding dramatically enhanced rAAS19 against thrombin is not unique as similar ob - servations were reported for a viral serpin ( Li et al . , 2008 ) . The rAAS19 inhibitor function pro ﬁ le in this study is partly similar to the inhibitory pro ﬁ le of antithrombin III , which inhibits thrombin , fXa , fIX , fXI , fXII , plasmin , kallikrein , and trypsin ( Bock , 2006 ; Danielsson and Bjork , 1982 ; Kumar et al . , 2013 ) . Heparin binding accelerates antithrombin III inhibitory activity against thrombin , fIXa , and fXa ( (cid:5) 1000 - fold ) ( Bedsted et al . , 2003 ; Jordan et al . , 1980 ; Olson et al . , 1992 ) , and to a less extent kallikrein , fXI , and fXII ( Holmer et al . , 1981 ; Scott et al . , 1982 ) . It is interesting to note that heparin binding enhances rAAS19 inhibitory activity against kallikrein , fIX , and especially against thrombin for which the SI index decreased 2 . 7 e 4 . 3 - fold . However , in contrast to anti - thrombin III , inhibitory activity of rAAS19 against fXa , fXIIa , and plasmin was inhibited after heparin binding . Could native AAS19 represent the tick version of antithrombin III at the feeding site ? Our data suggest the potential of medicinal applications for rAAS19 in treatment of blood clotting disorders . The observation that the signi ﬁ cant delay in plasma clotting above those observed with rAAS19 or HSGAGs alone required HSGAGs and rAAS19 to be in Fig . 3 .

Mulenga / Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 80 ( 2017 ) 1 e 10 7 complex other than the two molecules simply being in a reaction together , has signi ﬁ cant implications toward efforts to improve heparin based treatment of blood clotting disorders . Heparin is used to treat and / or prevent blood - clotting disorders in a wide range of conditions such as preventing thrombi and formation of blood clots in many surgical cases ( Gallus et al . , 1976 ; Rasmussen et al . , 2009 ) . In addition to potential toxicity due accidental over - dosing ( Monagle et al . , 2012 ; Monte et al . , 2010 ) , patients are at risk of developing life threatening heparin - induced thrombocytopenia a serious immune system - mediated complication that results in depleted platelets ( Warkentin , 1998 ) and was reported to occur in up to 58 % of critically ill patients ( Gupta et al . , 2015 ) . Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia occurs when heparin , a negatively charged molecule , binds to platelet factor 4 ( PF4 ) , a positively charged protein found in platelet a - granules , on platelet and some cell surfaces ( Warkentin , 1998 ) . Heparin binding exposes antigenic neo - epitopes that act as immunogens leading to production of antibodies to heparin - PF4 , which lead to immune mediated depletion of platelets and secretion of factors enhancing thrombin generation which leads to thrombosis ( Amiral et al . , 1992 ; Kelton et al . , 1994 ) . Our data suggest that the possibility for heparin - induced thrombocytopenia will be eliminated in that heparin will be delivered in complex with rAAS19 and thus may not be biolog - ically available to bind to PF4 and thus no life threatening anti - bodies will form . Additionally , our data showing that we could achieve signi ﬁ cant plasma clotting delay using less heparin suggest that toxicity due to overdose will be prevented . Heparin based thromboprophylaxis primarily exploits anti - thrombin and fXa effects of this molecule . The risk is that pa - tients face the potential to develop bleeding ( Weitz , 2011 ) . Preferred alternative targets for treatment includes fXIa , which impairs thrombus formation with minimal impact on hemostasis ( Bane and Gailani , 2014 ; Muller et al . , 2011 ) , and fIXa , which is preferred in treatment of venous thromboembolism ( Eikelboom et al . , 2010 ) . Data here and elsewhere ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) show that rAAS19 is an inhibitor of fXIa and fIXa , suggesting the potential for this molecule to be used in anticoagulant therapy . In addition , the observation that LMWH and MMWH signi ﬁ cantly potentiated rAAS19 inhibitory activity against fIXa is interesting . The potential of serpin - heparin covalent complexes to be used in thrombus therapy was successfully demonstrated ( Chan et al . , 1997 ; Stevi (cid:3) c et al . , 2013 ) . It will be interesting to investigate if functionally active rAAS19 can form covalent complex with different heparins . In conclusion , data here suggest that there is likelihood for native AAS19 to undergo post - secretion modi ﬁ cation through binding onto GAGs or proteoglycans at the tick - feeding site . On the basis of data in study , we conclude that native AAS19 is a likely inhibitor of thrombin and other trypsin - related proteases . Kim et al . ( 2016a ) showed that RNAi silencing of AAS19 caused deformities in ticks suggesting that this serpin regulated an important protease in the tick . There is evidence that invertebrates do produce heparin - like GAGs ( Chavante et al . , 2014 ; Pav ~ ao , 2014 ) . It will be inter - esting to investigate if tick derived GAGs affected inhibitory func - tions of native AAS19 in the tick .
