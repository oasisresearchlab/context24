ABSTRACT Cadherin trafficking controls tissue morphogenesis and cell polarity . The endo - cytic adaptor Numb participates in apicobasal polarity by acting on intercellular adhesions in epithelial cells . However , it remains largely unknown how Numb controls cadherin - based adhesion . Here , we found that Numb directly interacted with p120 catenin ( p120 ) , which is known to interact with E - cadherin and prevent its internalization . Numb accumulated at inter - cellular adhesion sites and the apical membrane in epithelial cells . Depletion of Numb im - paired E - cadherin internalization , whereas depletion of p120 accelerated internalization . Ex - pression of the Numb - binding fragment of p120 inhibited E - cadherin internalization in a dominant - negative fashion , indicating that Numb interacts with the E - cadherin / p120 com - plex and promotes E - cadherin endocytosis . Impairment of Numb induced mislocalization of E - cadherin from the lateral membrane to the apical membrane . Atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) , a member of the PAR complex , phosphorylated Numb and inhibited its association with p120 and α - adaptin . Depletion or inhibition of aPKC accelerated E - cadherin internaliza - tion . Wild - type Numb restored E - cadherin internalization in the Numb - depleted cells , where - as a phosphomimetic mutant or a mutant with defective α - adaptin - binding ability did not restore the internalization . Thus , we propose that aPKC phosphorylates Numb to prevent its binding to p120 and α - adaptin , thereby attenuating E - cadherin endocytosis to maintain api - cobasal polarity . INTRODUCTION The dynamic rearrangement of cell – cell adhesion plays a critical role in various physiological processes , including tissue development , wound healing , synaptogenesis , epithelial – mesenchymal transitions , and tumor metastasis . Cadherin mediates cell – cell adhesion by Ca 2 + - dependent homophilic interactions and establishes adherens junctions . E - cadherin is the major cell – cell adhesion molecule in most epithelial tissues and is important for cell – cell adhesion and epithelial cell polarity . In epithelial cells , E - cadherin localizes to lat - eral cell – cell contact sites but is excluded from the apical mem - brane . E - cadherin binds to β - catenin , which is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through α - catenin , and to p120 catenin ( p120 ) , which regulates E - cadherin stability and trafficking ( Peifer and Yap , 2003 ; Bryant and Mostov , 2008 ; Nelson , 2009 ; Reynolds , 2010 ) . Recent studies have indicated that E - cadherin trafficking has a pivotal role in remodeling E - cadherin - mediated cell – cell adhesions ( Yap et al . , 2007 ; Delva and Kowalczyk , 2009 ; Ulrich and Heisenberg , 2009 ) . Cell surface E - cadherin undergoes endocytosis and recycling back to the plasma membrane via early and recycling endosomes Monitoring Editor Tamotsu Yoshimori Osaka University Received : Apr 1 , 2011 Revised : May 31 , 2011 Accepted : Jun 25 , 2011 3104 | K . Sato et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell ( Bryant and Stow , 2004 ; Yeaman et al . , 2004 ) . The adhesive strength of the cell – cell contacts partly depends on the amount of E - cadherin at the cell surface ( Steinberg and Takeichi , 1994 ; Yap et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , E - cadherin trafficking appears to regulate cadherin - based ad - hesive activity by balancing the relative amounts of surface - exposed and sequestered intracellular E - cadherin . E - cadherin and VE - cadherin undergo endocytosis though clathrin - dependent and clath - rin - independent pathways ( Le et al . , 1999 ; Akhtar and Hotchin , 2001 ; Paterson et al . , 2003 ; Palacios et al . , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 2005 ; Bryant and Mostov , 2007 ; Toyoshima et al . , 2007 ) . The adaptor pro - tein complex 2 ( AP - 2 ) associates with E - cadherin through its dileu - cine motif and induces E - cadherin endocytosis in a clathrin - depen - dent manner ( Miyashita and Ozawa , 2007 ; Ishiyama et al . , 2010 ; Reynolds , 2010 ) . The protein p120 regulates E - cadherin trafficking and expression on the cell surface partly by inhibiting the entry of E - cadherin into the endocytic pathways ( Davis et al . , 2003 ; Miyashita and Ozawa , 2007 ; Reynolds , 2010 ) . Further studies have indicated that p120 associates with the membrane - proximal region of E - cadherin and masks its dileucine motif , thereby preventing in - ternalization ( Miyashita and Ozawa , 2007 ) . However , the regulatory mechanisms for how E - cadherin is internalized remain largely unknown . Numb was originally identified as the cell - fate determinant of nervous system development in Drosophila ( Betschinger and Knoblich , 2004 ; Roegiers and Jan , 2004 ) . In sensory organ precursor cells , Numb localizes asymmetrically , segregating into one daughter cell during cell division . Numb binds to Notch and inhibits Notch signaling through its endocytosis , thereby regulating cell fate ( Berdnik et al . , 2002 ) . Numb comprises an N - terminal phosphoty - rosine binding ( PTB ) domain and a proline - rich region ( PRR ) spanning the C - terminal side ( Figure 1B ) . The PTB domain conventionally mediates association with the NPxY motif in transmembrane pro - teins . Numb interacts with endocytic adaptors such as α - adaptin and Eps15 that respectively bind to the DPF and NPF motifs at the C terminus of Numb ( Salcini et al . , 1997 ; Santolini et al . , 2000 ) . Numb selectively promotes clathrin - dependent endocytosis of transmembrane proteins , including Notch ( Traub , 2003 ; Sorkin , 2004 ) , by linking the adaptors with them . We previously found that Numb interacts with the L1 adhesion molecule and promotes the polarized endocytosis of L1 at axonal growth cones ( Nishimura et al . , 2003 ) . Numb associates with integrin - β s ( Calderwood et al . , 2003 ) , localizes to clathrin - coated structures , and promotes integrin endocytosis for directional cell mi - gration with the PAR complex ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . The PAR complex , which is composed of PAR - 3 , PAR - 6 , and atypical pro - tein kinase C ( aPKC ) , functions in various cell polarization events , including front – rear polarity in migrating cells and apicobasal polar - ity in epithelial cells ( Suzuki and Ohno , 2006 ; Goldstein and Macara , 2007 ) . PAR - 3 interacts with Numb and induces aPKC - mediated phosphorylation of Numb ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . This phosphorylation prevents the association of Numb with integrin - β s and α - adaptin , which inhibits integrin endocytosis . It has been shown that Numb forms a complex containing E - cadherin / N - cadherin , β - catenin , and α - catenin and is required for proper formation of adherens junctions in neuroepithelial cells ( Rasin et al . , 2007 ) . Further studies revealed that Numb is involved in the lateral localization of E - cadherin in epithelial cells and in HGF - in - duced cell scattering ( Wang et al . , 2009 ; Lau and McGlade , 2011 ) . However , it remains unclear whether Numb controls E - cadherin en - docytosis , and if so , how the process is regulated . In light of these observations , we explored the role of Numb in E - cadherin trafficking . We found that Numb primarily interacts with p120 and participates in the endocytosis of E - cadherin with p120 in epithelial cells in an α - adaptin - dependent and clathrin - dependent manner . We also discovered that aPKC phosphorylates Numb , pre - venting its association with p120 , E - cadherin , and α - adaptin , which results in the inhibition of E - cadherin endocytosis . Characterizing the functions of Numb as a cargo - selective adaptor provides the basis for further understanding of the polarized distribution of E - cadherin and the dynamic remodeling of cell – cell adhesion in epi - thelial cells . RESULTS Numb partially overlaps with the E - cadherin complex at cell – cell contacts To explore the role of Numb in the epithelium , we first examined the distribution of Numb with immunofluorescence analysis using epi - thelial MCF7 cells . Endogenous Numb showed punctate staining throughout the cytoplasm and accumulation at the cell – cell contacts ( Figure 1A ) . When the cells were costained for E - cadherin and caten - ins ( p120 and β - catenin ) , Numb partially overlapped with these mol - ecules at intercellular adhesion sites ( Figure 1A ) . Higher - magnifica - tion images demonstrated that Numb appeared punctated even at cell – cell contacts . The punctate staining of Numb appears to repre - sent localization to early and recycling endosomes ( Smith et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , consistent with an electromicroscopic study of Numb localization ( Santolini et al . , 2000 ) , punctate staining arose from both basolateral membrane and vesicles containing E - cadherin ( see below ) . We next identified the region of Numb responsible for its localization to the adhesion sites by using GFP - fused Numb frag - ments ( Figure 1B ) . GFP - Numb - full - length localized to sites of cell – cell contact in a manner similar to endogenous Numb ( Figure 1C ) . Under this condition , GFP - Numb - PRR , including the entire PRR re - gion , accumulated at contact sites where the cadherin complex was enriched , in contrast to Numb fragments with additional deletions ( PRR / 1 , PRR / 2 , PRR / 3 ) and GFP - Numb - PTB ( Figure 1C ) . These data indicate that Numb localizes to intercellular adhesion sites through its PRR region . Stable targeting of Numb to cell – cell contacts did not simply reflect the binding ability of Numb fragments to E - cad - herin or p120 ( Figure 2B ) but might involve unidentified molecules or a structural conformation of Numb . Of note , GFP - Numb - PTB and GFP - Numb - PRR / 3 accumulated in the nucleus . This nuclear accu - mulation might indicate cell - proliferative and tumor - suppressive roles of Numb ( Pece et al . , 2004 ; Colaluca et al . , 2008 ; Yan et al . , 2008 ) . Clathrin light chain ( CLC ) and α - adaptin , a member of AP - 2 , also slightly accumulated at cell – cell contacts and partially over - lapped with Numb ( Supplemental Figure 1A ) . Furthermore , when we expressed the Numb mutants DLA , NLA , or DLA / NLA , which are defective in binding to Eps15 , α - adaptin , or both , respectively ( Salcini et al . , 1997 ; Santolini et al . , 2000 ) , they showed a similar ac - cumulation at cell – cell contacts as wild - type Numb ( Supplemental Figure 1B ) , suggesting that Numb localizes to intercellular adhesion sites independently of the endocytic proteins . Numb directly binds to p120 Accumulating evidence suggests a functional interaction between Numb and cadherins ( Kuo et al . , 2006 ; Rasin et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . We therefore examined whether Numb interacts with the cad - herin / catenin complex and endocytic proteins in MCF7 cells . When E - cadherin or p120 was immunoprecipitated from MCF7 cells , Numb and the endocytic proteins ( clathrin heavy chain [ CHC ] and α - adaptin ) were coimmunoprecipitated ( Figure 2A ) . Similarly , E - cadherin and p120 were detected in the immunoprecipitates of Numb . Further - more , Numb , E - cadherin , and p120 were coimmunoprecipitated Volume 22 September 1 , 2011 Numb and aPKC in E - cadherin endocytosis | 3105 with the endocytic proteins ( Figure 2A ) . p190RhoGAP , which inter - acts with p120 ( Wildenberg et al . , 2006 ) , was coimmunoprecipitated primarily with p120 and somewhat with Numb , whereas Histone H3 as a negative control was not detected in the precipitates of either the cadherin complex or endocytic proteins . To identify the interacting region between Numb and E - cadherin or p120 , we performed a pulldown assay using purified GST - Numb - full - length or fragments containing the carboxyl PRR / 3 region to pre - cipitate E - cadherin or p120 from the lysate of MCF7 cells ( Figure 2B ) . E - cadherin preferentially bound to full - length Numb , whereas p120 and α - adaptin ( used as a positive control ) interacted with full - length Numb , PRR , and PRR / 3 to a similar extent . Of note , because E - cad - herin was not efficiently precipitated with Numb PRR and PRR / 3 ( in comparison to full - length Numb ) , the PTB domain might partly con - tribute to association with E - cadherin ( Figure 2B ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Conversely , the GST - E - cadherin cytoplasmic region precipitated Numb , Hakai , β - catenin , α - adaptin , CHC , and p120 ( Figure 2C ) . GST - p120 associated with Numb , β - catenin , α - adaptin , CHC , and E - cadherin ( Figure 2C ) . Considered together with the immunopre - cipitation data ( Figure 2A ) , these results suggest that Numb can form a complex with E - cadherin , catenins , and the endocytic proteins . To determine whether the interaction of E - cadherin and p120 with Numb is direct , we performed an in vitro binding assay using purified proteins . This assay revealed that full - length Numb bound to GST - p120 and loosely bound to the GST - E - cadherin cytoplasmic region ( Figure 2D ) , indicating a direct interaction between Numb and p120 . Depletion of Numb , AP - 2 , clathrin , and p120 in MCF7 cells On the basis of the evidence that Numb is involved in the endocy - tosis of several transmembrane proteins ( Berdnik et al . , 2002 ; FIguRE 1 : Numb partially overlaps with E - cadherin components at cell – cell contacts .

Volume 22 September 1 , 2011 Numb and aPKC in E - cadherin endocytosis | 3107 ization in a time - dependent manner that was similar to the observed rate of E - cadherin internalization ( Supplemental Figure 3B ) . In the Numb - , α - adaptin - , or CHC - depleted cells , the time - dependent in - crease in intracellular E - cadherin was delayed as compared with the control cells ( Figure 4A ) . The difference was most evident at 15 min after initiation ( Figure 4B ) . Trf - R internalization was also delayed in the α - adaptin - or CHC - depleted cells , whereas Numb knockdown had no apparent effect on Trf - R internalization ( Figure 4A ) , implying that Numb is specifically involved in E - cadherin endocytosis . Numb forms a complex with p120 and internalized E - cadherin We attempted to precipitate internalized E - cadherin with an anti - body against the extracellular domain of E - cadherin ( see Materials and Methods for details ) . When surface E - cadherin was precipitated , β - catenin and α - catenin were predominantly coprecipitated , and Numb and endocytic molecules were detected at low levels ( Figure 4C ) . Removal of the antibody from the cell surface with acid buffer prevented the precipitation of cell - surface E - cadherin ( Figure 4C ) , allowing us to precipitate only the internalized E - cad - herin . When the internalized E - cadherin was precipitated , we de - tected an increased amount of Numb ; endocytic proteins , including α - adaptin and CHC ; and p120 in the immunoprecipitates ( Figure 4C ) . Our immunocytological results also showed that Numb staining par - tially overlapped with surface E - cadherin and internalized E - cad - herin ( Supplemental Figure 4 , A and B ) . These data suggest that internalized E - cadherin forms a complex with Numb and that the binding of Numb to the cadherin / catenin complex initiates its endocytosis . Numb is essential for proper cell adhesion and basolateral localization of E - cadherin and p120 in polarized MDCKII cells To address the role of Numb in intercellular adhesion and epithelial cell polarity , we examined the effects of Numb depletion on E - cad - herin - mediated cell – cell adhesion by categorizing colonies of MCF7 cells based on E - cadherin immunofluorescence ( Shtutman et al . , 2006 ; Gross et al . , 2009 ) . The colonies were categorized as com - pact , loose , or scattered depending on the strength of cell adhesion ( Figure 5A ) . In the control scramble - transfected cells , ∼ 40 % of the colonies were categorized as compact . However , the depletion of Numb , α - adaptin , or CHC increased the population of compact colonies ( Figure 5B ) . In contrast , when the cells were transfected with siRNA targeting p120 , the cells showed a scattered appear - ance ( Figure 5B ) . These results suggest that inhibition of E - cadherin endocytosis strengthens intercellular adhesion and that p120 is re - quired for the maintenance of cell – cell contacts . We further investigated the role of Numb in polarized MDCKII cells . Consistent with a previous report ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) , Numb accumulated at the lateral membrane where E - cadherin and p120 localized and at the apical membrane region ( Figure 5C and Sup - plemental Figure 5 ) . The effectiveness of siRNA targeting Numb in MDCKII cells was confirmed with immunoblot analysis ( Supple - mental Figure 2 , E and F ) . In Numb - depleted cells , E - cadherin and p120 mainly localized to the apical membrane region ( Figure 5D ) , but the locations of ZO - 1 and Na + / K + - ATPase , a tight junction and a basolateral protein , respectively , were almost unchanged ( Sup - plemental Figure 6 , A and C ) . These results imply that Numb de - pletion induces a change in the localization of E - cadherin and p120 from the lateral membrane to the apical membrane region . We then examined whether Numb controls the localization of E - cadherin and p120 in MDCK 3D cysts ( Debnath et al . , 2003 ; Nishimura et al . , 2003 ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) , we next ex - ploited an RNA interference ( RNAi ) approach to address the roles of Numb in E - cadherin endocytosis in MCF7 cells . Two different small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) targeting either Numb or p120 were pre - pared , and their effectiveness was confirmed with immunoblot anal - ysis ( Supplemental Figure 2 , A – D ) . Numb and p120 siRNA transfec - tion specifically and effectively decreased respective expression to ∼ 5 – 20 % of the levels in the control scramble - transfected cells with - out noticeably affecting the expression of the transferrin receptor ( Trf - R ) ( Supplemental Figure 2 , A – D ) . E - cadherin expression in the p120 - depleted cells was suppressed to ∼ 30 – 50 % of the levels in control scramble - transfected cells , which is consistent with previous reports ( Davis et al . , 2003 ) . Moreover , siRNAs targeting α - adaptin and CHC were also used as controls to block clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Depletion of Numb , AP - 2 , and clathrin reduces E - cadherin endocytosis Previous studies have shown that Numb regulates the endocytosis of several receptors , including integrin - β s , as an adaptor protein , whereas p120 stabilizes E - cadherin at the cell surface . On the basis of these studies , we hypothesized that Numb controls E - cadherin endocytosis by associating with p120 . We first visualized the inter - nalized E - cadherin with an antibody against the E - cadherin extracel - lular region ( HECD1 ) in MCF7 cells , according to a previously de - scribed method ( Paterson et al . , 2003 ) . Blocking with excess nonfluorescent antibody almost completely eliminated the immun - ofluorescence of E - cadherin at the cell surface , which allowed us to detect only the internalized E - cadherin after permeabilization ( Figure 3A ) . Internalized E - cadherin was detected in the cytoplasm after 10 min and increased in a time - dependent manner ( Figure 3B ) . Incubation for more than 30 min led to a small amount of detectable fluorescence at sites of cell – cell contacts , probably due to the recy - cling of E - cadherin back to the surface . Internalized E - cadherin ulti - mately accumulated in the central region of the cells ( Figure 3B ) . To elucidate the role of Numb in the internalization of E - cadherin , an internalization assay was performed with the depletion of Numb , p120 , α - adaptin , or CHC . Internalization of E - cadherin was delayed in the Numb - , α - adaptin - , and CHC - depleted cells at 10 min after the incubation , whereas internalization was accelerated by the de - pletion of p120 , as expected ( Davis et al . , 2003 ) . The level of inter - nalized E - cadherin showed no remarkable difference between the Numb - , α - adaptin - , or CHC - depleted cells and the control cells af - ter 30 min of incubation ( Figure 3 , C and D ) . These data suggest that Numb , AP - 2 , and clathrin are involved in E - cadherin internalization and that other pathways , such as clathrin - independent or phago - cytic internalization , also contribute to E - cadherin internalization . Numb , AP - 2 , and clathrin are required for E - cadherin endocytosis We further examined the effects of Numb depletion on E - cadherin endocytosis biochemically , with an endocytosis assay ( see Materials and Methods ) . Treatment of cells with a glutathione buffer reduced the biotin remaining at the cell surface to an undetectable level ( Sup - plemental Figure 3A ) , as described previously ( Le et al . , 1999 ) . Inter - nalized E - cadherin was detectable 5 min after initiation and gradually increased in a time - dependent manner ( Supplemental Figure 3 , B and C ) . The transient decrease in internalized E - cadherin at 20 min might represent the beginning of degradation processes ( Supple - mental Figure 3C ; Lu et al . , 2003 ; Palacios et al . , 2005 ) . As a control , we used Trf - R , which undergoes clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2003 ; Motley et al . , 2003 ) . Trf - R underwent internal - 3108 | K . Sato et al .

Numb localized to the baso - lateral membrane where E - cadherin and p120 also accumulated ( Figure 5E ) , whereas actin filaments accumulated at the apical mem - brane ( Debnath et al . , 2003 ) . In the cysts of the Numb - depleted MDCKII cells , the localization of E - cadherin and p120 was dramati - cally shifted to the apical side near the actin filaments ( Figure 5F ) , but ZO - 1 was apparently unaffected ( Supplemental Figure 6B ) . These results suggest that the apical accumulation of E - cadherin and p120 results from the impairment of Numb - mediated endocy - tosis and / or exocytosis . Numb controls E - cadherin endocytosis by interacting with the C - terminal region of p120 To further understand the functional relationship between Numb and p120 , we constructed various p120 fragments and tested their association with Numb in MCF7 cells ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . The Volume 22 September 1 , 2011 Numb and aPKC in E - cadherin endocytosis | 3109 full - length p120 and the p120 fragments containing both ARM re - peats and their N - terminally proximal region ( p120 - 2 , p120 - 5 ) as - sociated with E - cadherin , whereas other p120 fragments ( p120 - 1 , p120 - 3 , p120 - 4 , and p120 - 6 ) failed to associate with E - cadherin ( Figure 6B ) , as described previously ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ) . Under these conditions , Numb interacted with the full - length p120 and p120 fragments containing the C - terminus ( p120 - 2 , p120 - 4 , p120 - 6 ) ( Figure 6B ) , indicating that Numb interacts with the C - terminal re - gion of p120 , which is distinct from the E - cadherin - binding region . We next examined the localization of p120 mutants in polarized MDCKII cells . GFP - p120 - full - length localized to the cell – cell con - tacts where E - cadherin localized . GFP - p120 - 5 localized not only to cell – cell contacts but also to the apical side where E - cadherin local - ized ( Figure 6C ) . Expression of GFP - p120 - 5 induced the apical ac - cumulation of E - cadherin ( in ∼ 80 % of the cells ) but had no appre - ciable effects on ZO - 1 distribution ( Figure 6C ) . The expression of p120 - 5 might inhibit the linkages between E - cadherin and Numb by replacing endogenous p120 , resulting in the compromised accumu - lation of E - cadherin at the apical membrane . These data suggest that the C - terminal region of p120 is required for the proper local - ization of p120 and E - cadherin . Consistent with our data , it has been reported that the C - terminal region of p120 is involved in E - cadherin trafficking ( Liu et al . , 2007 ) . To test the physiological importance of the interaction of p120 with Numb , we examined the effects of various fragments of p120 on E - cadherin internalization . Immunoblot analysis showed that there was only slight variation in the expression level between constructs ( Supplemental Figure 7A ) . Under these conditions , overexpression of full - length p120 and p120 - 5 showed minimal effects , whereas overexpression of p120 - 6 , which prevented the interaction between p120 and Numb ( Figure 6D ) , decreased the level of internalized E - cadherin ( Figure 6E ) , suggesting that p120 - 6 acts as the dominant FIguRE 4 : Numb is responsible for E - cadherin endocytosis .

The effectiveness of siRNA targeting aPKC was confirmed with im - munoblot analysis ( Figure 8 , A and B ) . Transfection of mixed siRNAs targeting aPKC ζ and aPKC λ specifically decreased their expression levels to ∼ 5 % of that of the control scramble - transfected cells with - out noticeably affecting the level of Trf - R , which is an unrelated pro - tein ( Figure 8 , A and B ) . Depletion of aPKC using siRNA or treatment with an aPKC inhibitor enhanced E - cadherin internalization ( Figure 8C ) . These data raise the possibility that aPKC controls the internalization of E - cadherin through Numb phosphorylation . In support of this possibility , aPKC depletion increased the population of scattered colonies in MCF7 cells ( Figure 8D ) . To further confirm the physiological importance of Numb in E - cadherin endocytosis , we performed rescue experiments using vari - ous Numb mutants ( Figures 1B and 7A ) . The expression of these mutants was monitored by immunoblot analysis ( Supplemental Fig - ure 7B ) . The expression of full - length sr - Numb rescued the inhibitory effect of Numb depletion on E - cadherin internalization , whereas sr - GFP - Numb - S7D and sr - GFP - Numb - 3D failed to rescue it ( Figure 8E ) . The phosphodeficient Numb mutants , S7A and 3A , could partially restore E - cadherin internalization , which suggests that a proper phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle is required for full res - toration . Furthermore , Numb mutants defective in binding to endo - cytic proteins , such as NLA , DLA , and NLA / DLA , also failed to com - pensate for the Numb depletion . Thus , E - cadherin internalization appears to require Numb association with endocytic proteins . DISCUSSION AP - 2 containing α - adaptin associates with E - cadherin through its dileucine motif in the absence of p120 and induces E - cadherin en - docytosis in a clathrin - dependent manner ( Figure 9 , A and B ; Miyashita and Ozawa , 2007 ; Yap et al . , 2007 ; Ishiyama et al . , 2010 ; Reynolds , 2010 ) . Furthermore , p120 associates with the membrane - proximal region of E - cadherin and masks its dileucine motif , thereby preventing internalization ( Figure 9B ; Miyashita and Ozawa , 2007 ) . We found that Numb partially overlapped with E - cadherin and p120 at cell – cell contact sites ( Figure 1A ) . Numb interacted with p120 and E - cadherin both in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 2 ) . The C - terminal region of Numb interacted with the C - terminal region of p120 ( Figures 2D and 6B ) . The PRR containing the C - terminal region of Numb was required for its localization to sites of cell – cell contact ( Figure 1C ) . Numb depletion impaired E - cadherin internalization and strength - ened cell – cell adhesive activity , whereas p120 depletion acceler - ated the internalization and weakened cell – cell adhesive activity ( Figures 3 and 5 , A and B ) . Expression of the Numb - binding , C - ter - minal fragment of p120 inhibited E - cadherin internalization in a negative fragment . These results indicate that the interaction be - tween p120 and Numb is required for E - cadherin internalization . We also performed rescue experiments with the p120 mutants . The expression of the siRNA - resistant ( sr ) - p120 - full - length , but not that of p120 - 6 , restored E - cadherin internalization in p120 - de - pleted cells to control levels . Of note , the sr - GFP - p120 fragment lacking the Numb - binding region ( p120 - 5 ) rescued the effects of p120 depletion more efficiently than sr - p120 - full - length ( Figure 6E ) . This may be due to the lacking of the interaction of p120 - 5 with Numb . aPKC regulates the interaction of Numb with E - cadherin and p120 by phosphorylation Our group and others previously found that aPKC phosphorylates Numb at three serine residues ( Ser - 7 , Ser - 265 , and Ser - 284 ) in a PAR - 3 - dependent manner ( Figure 7A ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ; Smith et al . , 2007 ) . To generate phosphomimetic mutants , Ser - 7 was mutated to aspartic acid ( GFP - Numb - full - length S7D ) , and all three residues were mutated to aspartic acid ( GFP - Numb - full - length 3D ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . To generate phos - phodeficient mutants , Ser - 7 was mutated to alanine ( GFP - Numb - full - length S7A ) , and all three residues were mutated to alanine ( GFP - Numb - full - length 3A ) . We also used a previously character - ized antibody that specifically recognizes Numb phosphorylated at Ser - 7 ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . Numb and GFP - Numb local - ized to the apical membrane region and the lateral membrane in polarized MDCKII cells ( Figure 5C and Supplemental Figure 5 ) , whereas Numb phosphorylated at Ser - 7 localized to the apical membrane region but not the lateral membrane ( Figure 7B and Supplemental Figure 8A ) . GFP - Numb - full - length S7A and GFP - Numb - full - length 3A localized to the apical and lateral membrane , whereas GFP - Numb - full - length S7D and GFP - Numb - full - length 3D localized to the apical membrane but not the lateral membrane ( Supplemental Figure 8B ) . GFP - PAR - 3 and aPKC mainly localized to the apical membrane , including the apical junction area ( Figure 7B ) , and partially overlapped with phosphorylated Numb at the apical membrane , suggesting that aPKC can efficiently phosphorylate Numb at the apical membrane . The polarized localization of Numb led us to examine the effect of Numb phosphorylation on the interaction of Numb with E - cad - herin , p120 , and α - adaptin . Numb phosphorylation by aPKC im - paired the association of Numb with E - cadherin , p120 , and α - adaptin ( Figure 7C ) . When the Numb mutants were precipitated from the MCF7 cells , E - cadherin , p120 , and α - adaptin predominantly copre - cipitated with the phosphodeficient Numb mutants , S7A and 3A , but not with the phosphomimetic Numb mutants , S7D and 3D ( Figure 7D ) . Taken together , these results suggest that aPKC nega - tively controls Numb binding to E - cadherin and p120 .

PAR - 3 lo - calizes to apical junctions , such as adherens and tight junctions in the epithelium ( Izumi et al . , 1998 ; Suzuki and Ohno , 2006 ) . PAR - 3 and aPKC are necessary for the formation of adherens junctions and tight junctions in MDCK cells ( Ooshio et al . , 2007 ) . We found that aPKC prevented E - cadherin endocytosis , presumably through Numb phosphorylation . Thus it is tempting to speculate that aPKC phosphorylates Numb at adherens and tight junctions and thereby impairs the Numb - mediated endocytosis of E - cadherin . This polar - ized endocytosis by Numb / aPKC could account for the polarized enrichment of E - cadherin at adherens junctions in the lateral mem - brane and ensure apicobasal polarity ( Figure 9C ) . Chemical materials and antibody The cDNAs encoding Numb , E - cadherin , CLC , and α - adaptin were described previously ( Kuroda et al . , 1996 ; Nishimura et al . , 2003 ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . Mouse p120 cDNA was described elsewhere ( Ohkubo and Ozawa , 1999 ) . The rabbit polyclonal anti – Numb antibody and anti – pS7 Numb - specific antibody were gener - ated and characterized as described previously ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) .

The following commercial antibodies were obtained : anti - aPKC ζ ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) ; anti - Numb ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) ; anti – E - cadherin ( ECCD2 ) and anti - ZO - 1 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) ; anti – E - cadherin ( HECD1 ; Takara Bio , Osaka , Japan ) ; anti – E - cadherin , anti - p120 , anti – β - catenin , anti – α - adaptin , anti - CHC , anti - p190RhoGAP , anti - aPKC λ , and anti - EEA1 ( BD Bioscience , San Jose , CA ) ; anti – Trf - R and anti – Na + / K + - ATPase ( Zymed , San Francisco , CA ) ; mouse monoclonal anti - GFP ( Roche , Barsel , Switzerland ) ; rat polyclonal anti - GFP ( Nacalai Tesque , Kyoto , Japan ) ; rabbit polyclonal anti - GFP ( MBL , Nagoya , Japan ) ; and anti - His ( Nacalai Tesque ) . Alexa488 - , Alexa555 - , and Alexa647 - conju - gated secondary antibodies against mouse , rabbit , or rat immuno - globulin G ( IgG ) , and phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probes ( Invitrogen ) . Other materials and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources . Plasmid construction Fragments of cDNA were amplified using PCR and subcloned into pGEX ( GE Healthcare , Buckinghamshire , UK ) , pRSET - c1 , and pEGFP ( Clontech Laboratories , Mountain View , CA ) vectors . Point muta - tions of Numb were generated using PCR - based site - directed muta - genesis . All fragments were confirmed with DNA sequencing . GST - fusion and His - fusion proteins were produced in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells and purified on Glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads ( GE Healthcare ) and Ni - NTA ( QIAGEN , Venlo , Netherlands ) , respectively . Cell culture and immunofluorescence analysis MCF7 cells were cultured in MEM ( Invitrogen ) with 1 × NEAA ( Invitrogen ) and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Nichirei Biosciences , dominant - negative manner ( Figure 6 , D and E ) . The internalized E - cadherin formed a complex with p120 , Numb , α - adaptin , and clathrin ( Figure 4C ) . Taken together , these observations indicate that Numb primarily associates with p120 and promotes the endocytosis of E - cadherin as a complex with p120 and other endocytic proteins , such as α - adaptin and clathrin . The weak interaction of Numb with E - cadherin raises the possibility that Numb is also involved in the endocytosis of the E - cadherin fraction not bound to p120 ( Figure 9B ) . PAR - 3 associates with Numb and enhances the aPKC - mediated phosphorylation of Numb ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . This phos - phorylation prevents the association of Numb with integrin - β s and α - adaptin , thereby inhibiting integrin endocytosis and controlling polarized cell migration . We found that the phosphorylation of Numb by aPKC blocked the association of Numb with α - adaptin , E - cad - herin , and p120 ( Figure 7 , A , C , and D ) . Depletion or inhibition of aPKC enhanced the internalization of E - cadherin ( Figure 8C ) . A phos - phomimetic Numb mutant , which is defective in binding to E - cad - herin and p120 , could not rescue the Numb knockdown phenotype under the conditions in which full - length Numb rescued the pheno - type ( Figure 8E ) . These results indicate that aPKC phosphorylates Numb and negatively regulates the Numb - mediated endocytosis of E - cadherin , as described for integrin ( Figure 9B ) . The endocytosis of E - cadherin at the lateral membrane and of integrin at the basal mem - brane appears to be coordinately regulated during collective cell migration ( Nelson , 2009 ) . Depletion of Numb and PAR - 3 impairs the wound - induced collective migration of epithelial cells ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ; Nakayama et al . , 2008 ) . Thus it is possible that Numb coordinately regulates the endocytosis of E - cadherin and inte - grin for collective migration under the control of PAR - 3 / aPKC . In polarized MDCKII cells and 3D cysts , E - cadherin and p120 lo - calized to the basolateral membrane where Numb accumulated ( Figure 5C and E ) . The depletion of Numb induced the mislocaliza - tion of E - cadherin and p120 to the apical membrane ( Figure 5 , D and F ) , suggesting that Numb is required for the proper localization of E - cadherin and p120 to the basolateral membrane . This finding is consistent with the recent observation that clathrin is required for the proper localization of basolateral proteins , including E - cadherin , to the basolateral membrane ( Deborde et al . , 2008 ) . Clathrin depletion depolarizes most basolateral proteins by interfering with their biosyn - thetic delivery and recycling , slowing the exit of basolateral proteins from the Golgi complex and promoting their abnormal sorting into apical carrier vesicles . In this regard , Numb has been implicated not only in the endocytosis of target proteins but also in the recycling of the target proteins from the recycling endosome to the plasma mem - brane ( Smith et al . , 2004 ) . Thus Numb depletion may induce the ab - normal sorting of E - cadherin and p120 to apical carrier vesicles . Immunoelectron microscopic studies have shown substantial E - cadherin accumulation at the apical adherens junctions in the lateral membrane of the intestinal epithelium ( Horiguchi et al . , 1994 ) .

In brief , MCF7 cells grown on PDL - coated slips were incubated with 50 μg / ml cycloheximide for 30 min at 37°C and further incubated at 4°C for 1 h to stop cellular activity . The cells were then incubated with 1 . 5 mg / ml sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin ( Pierce Chemical , Rockford , IL ) for 30 min followed by washing with the blocking reagent ( 50 mM NH 4 Cl in PBS containing 1 mM MgCl 2 ) and 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 to quench the free sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin , followed by several further washes in PBS . The cells were then incubated in the culture medium at 37°C for the indicated time period . To mea - sure total E - cadherin , the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % deoxycholate , 5 mM EDTA ) . To measure intracellular E - cadherin , the cells were incubated twice for 20 min at 4°C with glutathione solu - tion ( 60 mM glutathione , 0 . 83 M NaCl , 0 . 83 M NaOH , 1 % BSA ) to remove all cell - surface biotin and then lysed with RIPA buffer . Bioti - nylated intracellular E - cadherin was recovered on streptavidin beads , eluted by boiling in sample buffer for SDS – PAGE , and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti – E - cadherin or Trf - R anti - body . Internalization assay with HECD1 antibody and immunoprecipitation To immunoprecipitate intracellular internalized E - cadherin , the HECD1 antibody remaining at the surface was removed by acid washing ( 0 . 5 M acetic acid , 0 . 5 M NaCl ; Paterson et al . , 2003 ) . Then the immunoprecipitation assay was performed . Categorization of MCF7 colonies based on cell adhesion One thousand cells were plated per 100 - mm plate and allowed to form small colonies for 5 d . siRNA was added after 48 h of seeding . The number of cells maintaining contact with their neighbors was counted for each colony according to previous reports ( Shtutman et al . , 2006 ; Gross et al . , 2009 ) . The data consisted of three indepen - dent experiments . Cyst formation and immunostaining Cyst formation and immunostaining were performed as reported previously ( Debnath et al . , 2003 ) . In brief , Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) was spread onto coverslips and solidified at 37°C for 15 min . Then , 1 × 10 4 cells / ml cells mixed with medium containing 2 % Matrigel were seeded onto the coverslips and cul - tured for the indicated number of days . The samples were fixed with by boiling in sample buffer for SDS – PAGE , and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies . In vitro binding assay Purified GST - p120 and GST - E - cadherin cytoplasmic region were im - mobilized onto Glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads . The beads were incubated with purified His - Numb deletion fragments for 1 h at 4°C . Then the beads were washed three times , eluted by boiling in sam - ple buffer for SDS – PAGE , and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal anti – His antibody . Phosphorylation assay of Numb with aPKC The reaction was carried out in a 50 - μl assay mixture containing 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 50 ng recombinant aPKC ζ ( Upstate ) , 10 μM ATP , and 0 . 4 μM purified GST - Numb fragment for 30 min at 30°C . The assay mixture was in - cubated with Glutathione - Sepharose beads and then mixed with MCF7 cell lysate as described above for 1 h at 4°C . Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer . Internalization assay To analyze E - cadherin internalization , we adapted an immunohis - tochemical assay based on those described previously ( Paterson et al . , 2003 ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . MCF7 cells were seeded onto PDL - coated coverslips . After 12 h , the culture medium was changed to Hanks’ balanced salt solution supplemented with 5 mM Ca 2 + and 50 μg / ml BSA , and the cells were equilibrated for 1 h . The cells were transferred to the chamber at 4°C . After incubation for an additional 1 h , the cells were incubated with the HECD1 antibody , which recognizes the extracellular domain of E - cadherin , for 1 h at 4°C . Afterward , the coverslips were washed with ice - cold PBS to remove the unbound antibody , and the medium was replaced with Hanks’ balanced salt solution prewarmed to 37°C . After incubation at 37°C for various time periods , the cells were washed with ice - cold PBS three times and then fixed and incubated with an excess amount of unconjugated anti – mouse IgG ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , ME ) to block the antibody remaining on the cell surface . Subse - quently , the cells were permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 . The internalized E - cadherin was visualized with a fluorescence - conju - gated secondary antibody . To quantify the internalization , images of cells were captured with the LSM5 PASCAL with apical to basal z - axis sections , and the projected images were used for quantifica - tion . The total fluorescent intensity within a cell was measured and divided by its area ( sum of pixel intensity / μm 2 ) . The data represent the mean and the SE of the mean ( SEM ) of more than 30 cells in each condition . All images were acquired under identical parame - ters . The data are representative of three independent experiments . residues that bind to Numb and Hakai . GGG is a core component that binds to p120 ( Miyashita and Ozawa , 2007 ; Ishiyama et al . , 2010 ) . ( B ) The epithelial cell is highly polarized with an apical surface and basal membrane . E - cadherin composes adherens junctions and maintains epithelial polarity . E - cadherin endocytosis is essential for maintaining adherens junctions and cell polarity . By interacting with E - cadherin and p120 , Numb plays a significant role in E - cadherin endocytosis , and its interactions are regulated through Numb phosphorylation by aPKC . Phosphorylated Numb cannot interact with E - cadherin and p120 and exists in the cytosol . There are two possible ways that Numb mediates E - cadherin endocytosis . First , Numb binds to p120 and mediates internalization of the entire E - cadherin complex containing p120 . Alternatively , Numb binds directly to the NVYYY motif in E - cadherin , which is usually masked by p120 , and internalizes p120 - unbound E - cadherin . With these mechanisms , Numb controls E - cadherin endocytosis through p120 and aPKC . ( C ) Polarized E - cadherin trafficking by Numb establishes adherens junctions and epithelial cell polarity . The PAR complex with Cdc42 , which localizes to tight and adherens junctions , has also recently emerged as an important regulator of endocytosis at adherens junctions ( Balklava et al . , 2007 ; Georgiou et al . , 2008 ; Leibfried et al . , 2008 ) . Numb is phosphorylated by aPKC and thus loses its ability to mediate E - cadherin endocytosis . As a result , aPKC prevents E - cadherin endocytosis and may stabilize cell – cell adhesion at adherens junctions . This polarized endocytosis could account for the restricted distribution of E - cadherin at the lateral membrane . 3118 | K . Sato et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Ireton RC et al . ( 2002 ) .
