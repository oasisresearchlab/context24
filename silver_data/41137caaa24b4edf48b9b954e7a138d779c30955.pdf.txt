It comprises two sub - assemblies : Retriever composed of VPS35L , VPS26C , and VPS29 ; and the CCC complex which contains twelve subunits : COMMD1 - COMMD10 and the coiled - coil domain - containing ( CCDC ) proteins CCDC22 and CCDC93 . Combining X - ray crystallography , electron cryomicroscopy , and in silico predictions , we have assembled a complete structural model of Commander . Retriever is distantly related to the endosomal Retromer complex but has unique features preventing the shared VPS29 subunit from interacting with Retromer - associated factors . The COMMD proteins form a distinctive hetero - decameric ring stabilized by extensive interactions with CCDC22 and CCDC93 . These adopt a coiled - coil structure that connects the CCC and Retriever assemblies and recruits a 16th subunit , DENND10 , to form the complete Commander complex . The structure allows map - ping of disease - causing mutations and reveals the molecular features required for the function of this evolu - tionarily conserved trafﬁcking machinery . INTRODUCTION Membrane trafﬁcking through the endosomal network is central to eukaryotic cell biology . Proteins entering the network are sorted between lysosomal degradation or retrieval and recycling to organelles that include the cell surface and the biosynthetic and autophagic compartments . 1 Several protein machineries are essential for cargo transport , including Retromer and the recently identiﬁed Commander complex . 2 – 5 Commander regulates Retromer - independent retrieval and recycling of hun - dreds of proteins including integrins and lipoprotein receptors , 6 and mutations in its subunits are causative for X - linked intellec - tual disability ( XLID ) and Ritscher - Schinzel syndrome ( RSS ) , a multi - system developmental disorder characterised by abnormal craniofacial features , cerebellar hypoplasia , and stunted cardiovascular development . 7 – 14 Commander is composed of sixteen subunits , arranged in two sub - assemblies , the CCC and Retriever complexes . Retriever , a VPS26C : VPS35L : VPS29 trimer , shares distant homology to Ret - romer , itself a trimer of VPS29 , VPS35 , and either VPS26A or VPS26B ( paralogues with VPS26C ) . 2 , 15 The CCC complex com - prises twelve components , the coiled coil domain - containing ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 , May 11 , 2023 ª 2023 The Authors .

Most transmembrane proteins sorted by Commander , including a 5 b 1 integrin , the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) , and lipoprotein receptors contain F xNxx [ YF ] sequence motifs ( where F is a hydrophobic amino acid ) that are recruited to Com - mander via the sorting nexin 17 ( SNX17 ) cargo adaptor . 6 , 20 , 23 – 29 Mutations in Commander lead to hypercholesterolemia through reduced trafﬁcking of LDLRs . 7 – 10 , 12 – 14 Commander is also required for cellular infection by human papilloma virus ( HPV ) 6 and SARS - CoV - 2 . 30 – 33 In addition , early studies of individual Commander subunits ( COMMD1 and COMMD7 ) implicated these proteins in regulating NF - k B levels and transcriptional Figure 1 .

Here we present a complete model of the sixteen subunit Commander complex . We show that Retriever , despite a super - ﬁcial similarity to the distantly related Retromer , forms a hetero - trimer with unique features that mediate its divergent function . The ten COMMD proteins assemble into a remarkable and unique structure , forming a hetero - decameric ring from ﬁve spe - ciﬁc heterodimers , with a precise and evolutionarily conserved subunit organization . The CCDC22 and CCDC93 proteins stabi - lize the CCC complex , with natively unstructured N - terminal se - quences forming extensive interactions around the decameric COMMD ring . An overall model of the fully assembled complex shows how CCDC proteins link the COMMD decameric ring to Retriever and recruit DENND10 through a central coiled - coil structure . Finally , our work allowed us to structurally map all known missense mutations that cause XLID and RSS . Many of these are found near interfaces between subunits , and our unbi - ased proteomic studies conﬁrm that they perturb complex for - mation . These studies provide key insights into the assembly and function of the Commander complex required for endoso - mal recycling of many essential transmembrane cargos . RESULTS Structure of the trimeric Retriever complex Recombinant human Retriever ( 3xStrepII - VPS26C , VPS35L , and VPS29 - 6xHis ) was expressed in insect cells using the biGBac system / MultiBac BEVS 52 , 53 and isolated using afﬁnity puriﬁca - tion and size - exclusion chromatography ( Methods S1 ) . 6 The resultant peak contained VPS26C , VPS35L , and VPS29 in a sta - ble 1 : 1 : 1 heterotrimer ( Methods S1 ) . Dispersed particles with an elongated ‘‘footprint’’ - like morphology were observed in nega - tive stain EM ( Methods S1 ) , and single particle 2D / 3D cryo - EM classes were dominated by the front view of the ‘‘footprint , ’’ with limited other orientations ( Methods S1 ) . Due to preferential orientation of the particles , gold - standard Fourier shell correla - tions ( FSCs ) are overestimated , and the 3D reconstruction was insufﬁcient for ab initio model building ( Table S1 ) . However , a high conﬁdence AlphaFold2 54 – 56 model of Retriever aligned well with the low - resolution 3D cryo - EM envelope ( Figure 1B ; Methods S1 ; Video S1 ) . Analogous to Retromer , 57 – 62 VPS35L is an extended a - sole - noid that binds VPS26C and VPS29 at its amino - and carboxy - terminal ends respectively ( Figures 1B and S1A ) . VPS35L has lit - tle sequence similarity to the Retromer subunit VPS35 ( < 21 % identity ) , but both are comprised of sixteen HEAT - like a - helical repeat structures . Unlike VPS35 , VPS35L has an additional conserved N - terminal sequence ( (cid:1) 180 residues ) that is mostly unstructured apart from elements that are predicted to engage both the last three a - helical repeats of VPS35L as well as VPS29 ( discussed below ) . The major interactions within Retriever were validated by structure - based mutagenesis . Analogous to VPS26A / B binding to VPS35 , 58 , 60 , 61 VPS26C associates with the second and third a - helical repeats in VPS35L via its C - terminal b - sandwich subdomain ( Figure 1C ) . VPS35L ( R293E ) ( see inset ( i ) in Figure 1B ) induced a > 95 % decrease in VPS26C binding but retained binding to VPS29 and the CCC complex ( Figure 1C ) . The major interaction of VPS29 with VPS35L is supported by the carboxy - terminal region of the VPS35L a - solenoid partially wrapping around VPS29 , similar to VPS35 in Retromer . 57 Mutagenesis of key binding res - idues , VPS35L ( H826E ) and VPS35L ( S781D ) ( see inset ( ii ) in Fig - ure 1B ) , resulted in > 95 % loss of VPS29 binding ( Figure 1D ) , and reciprocal mutations VPS29 ( I91D ) and VPS29 ( W93A ) also decreased VPS35L binding ( Figure 1E ) . Interestingly , reduced VPS29 interaction correlated with a decrease in CCC complex association , suggesting that its binding to VPS35L is important to stabilize Retriever and CCC assembly . N - terminal VPS35L sequences bind a conserved VPS29 site to prevent interaction with Retromer - accessory proteins Two interactions unique to Retriever further promote VPS29 binding and regulate its function . Firstly , a b - sheet extension at the base of VPS35L contacts VPS29 ( see inset ( iii ) in Figure 1B ) . Mutation of this interface with VPS35L ( I761G ) or complete deletion induced > 50 % reduction in VPS29 interaction ( with CCC complex retained ) ( Figure 1F ) , while reciprocal mutant VPS29 ( L67D ) reduced binding to VPS35L by approximately 30 % ( Figure 1E ) . The second unique VPS29 interaction involves the ﬁrst (cid:1) 40 residues of the extended N - terminal region of VPS35L ( see inset ( iv ) in Figure 1B ) . The ﬁrst 17 residues form an intramolecular interaction with the carboxy - terminal region of the VPS35L a - solenoid ( Figure 1B ) , with the same structure predicted for all VPS35L orthologues across species ( not shown ) . Deleting these residues leads to a near complete loss of VPS29 and CCC complex binding without affecting VPS26C association , which is replicated with VPS35L ( R9D / R11D ) and VPS35L ( L825K ) mutants ( Figure 1G ) . The intramolecular association of VPS35L N - and C - terminal regions serves to tether and orient two Pro - Leu ( PL ) motifs , 26 PL 27 and 34 PL 35 of VPS35L , for binding to a hydrophobic sur - face on VPS29 ( see inset ( v ) in Figure 1B ) . A synthetic VPS35L peptide ( Glu16 - Ile38 ) representing the predicted VPS29 - binding sequence showed modest afﬁnity for recombinant VPS29 ( K d of 1 . 8 ± 0 . 8 m M ) ( Figure 2A ) . An X - ray crystal structure of the VPS29 - peptide complex unambiguously conﬁrmed that Leu27 to Leu35 of VPS35L interact with two hydrophobic pockets on VPS29 ( Figure 2B ; Table S2 ) . The conserved 34 PL 35 side chains of VPS35L bind the VPS29 pocket deﬁned by Val174 and Leu152 respectively , VPS35L ( L27D ) and VPS35L ( L35D ) mutations block ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 , May 11 , 2023 2221 Article A B C D E F Figure 2 .

( D and F ) Pearson’s ( legend continued on next page ) ll OPEN ACCESS 2222 Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 , May 11 , 2023 Article peptide binding by ITC ( Figure 2A ) , and immunoprecipitations showed reduced binding to VPS29 and the CCC complex ( Fig - ure 2C ) . Moreover , VPS29 ( L152E ) and VPS29 ( V174D ) retained Retromer association but displayed a > 95 % decrease in binding to VPS35L ( and CCDC proteins ) , conﬁrming the central impor - tance of the 34 PL 35 - VPS29 association for Retriever assembly ( Figure 1E ) . Although covering a more extensive binding surface , VPS35L N - terminal sequences closely mimic VPS29 association with PL motifs in Retromer accessory proteins , including the RAB gua - nine nucleotide exchange factor ANKRD27 , and the RAB7 GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) TBC1D5 , and in the Retromer hijacking effector RidL from Legionella pneumophila 46 , 47 , 63 ( Fig - ure S1B ) . This implies that Retriever will be excluded from interacting with these Retromer accessory proteins . Indeed , re - combinant Retriever failed to bind recombinant TBC1D5 ( Fig - ure S1C ) , GFP - TBC1D5 failed to bind endogenous Retriever in cells , and GFP - VPS35L failed to isolate endogenous TBC1D5 ( Figures S1D and S1E ) . Retriever did not regulate the RAB7 GAP activity of endosomal TBC1D5 , as CRISPR / Cas9 knockout VPS35L HeLa cells did not phenocopy the defect in endosomal maturation and accumulation of hyperactivated RAB7 - GTP observed in Retromer KO cells 64 ( Figures S1F and S1G ) . Lastly , Retriever was not bound by over - expressed mCherry - RidL ( Fig - ure S1H ) . Retromer binding to TBC1D5 and RidL was observed in all controls . These results establish that while Retromer - assembled VPS29 provides a docking site for accessory pro - teins that regulate RAB GTPases ; 46 , 47 , 63 in Retriever , this binding site is occluded , and VPS29 serves to facilitate association with the CCC complex . We ﬁnally assessed the functional signiﬁcance of Retriever in recycling a 5 b 1 - integrin . The interrelated effects of VPS29 asso - ciation on CCC complex coupling precluded a mechanistic dissection of recycling using VPS35L mutants targeting VPS29 binding . However , we conﬁrmed the importance of VPS26C interaction using VPS35L ( R293E ) , which blocks VPS26C binding but retains VPS29 and CCC complex association ( Figure 1C ) . In VPS35L KO HeLa cells , loss of VPS35L induced a reduction in VPS26C levels , indicating their reciprocal requirement for Retriever stability . Knockout of VPS35L also resulted in a loss of CCC complex association with endosomes , demonstrating a requirement of Retriever for CCC endosome recruitment and an increased colocalization of a 5 b 1 - integrin with the LAMP1 - positive late endosome / lysosome ( Figures 2D – 2F ) with a corre - sponding reduction in surface a 5 b 1 - integrin 6 ( Figure 2E ) . These phenotypes were all rescued by wild - type VPS35L , but not the VPS26C - binding mutant VPS35L ( R293E ) ( Figures 2D – 2F ) . VPS26C therefore plays a central role in the endosomal associ - ation and function of Commander through a mechanism that may include association with the cargo adaptor SNX17 , 6 the WASH complex , 65 and / or an inherent ability of VPS26C to asso - ciate with membranes . 60 COMMD proteins assemble into distinct heteromeric complexes To deﬁne the stoichiometry and structure of the CCC complex , we co - expressed all ten human COMMD proteins in Escherichia coli . Four polycistronic vectors were designed , each tagged on a different COMMD protein ( Methods S1 ) . In parallel experiments , afﬁnity puriﬁcation of these four tagged - proteins followed by gel ﬁltration and peptide mass spectrometry resulted in the isolation of three homogeneous and stable tetrameric sub - complexes : COMMD1 - 4 - 6 - 8 ( isolated by COMMD1 - His ) , COMMD2 - 3 - 4 - 8 ( isolated by COMMD2 - His ) , and COMMD5 - 7 - 9 - 10 ( isolated by COMMD5 - His or COMMD10 - His ) , which we referred to as sub - complex A , B , and C , respectively ( Figure 3A ; Methods S1 ) . While each COMMD subcomplex was relatively stable , only subcomplex C produced an X - ray crystal structure ( 3 . 3 A˚ resolu - tion ) , revealing a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 heterotetrameric assembly formed by COMMD5 - COMMD10 and COMMD7 - COMMD9 heterodimers ( Figure 3B , Table S2 ) . The four COMM domains form an intimately assembled core structure with HN domains of COMMD9 and COMMD10 located peripherally . No clear den - sities of COMMD5 or COMMD7 HN domains were seen , pre - sumably due to ﬂexibility . Notably , the structure closely matches that predicted by AlphaFold2 multimer 56 , 66 ( Methods S1 ) . As ex - pected , the four COMM domains are structurally similar , composed of three anti - parallel b - sheets followed by a C - termi - nal a - helix . 42 The COMMD5 - COMMD10 and COMMD7 - COMMD9 dimers interact primarily via an extended b - sheet augmentation be - tween COMMD5 and COMMD7 COMM domains ( Figures 3B – 3D ) . In addition , contacts between the HN and COMM domains of all four COMMD proteins contribute to the overall speciﬁcity of assembly . Two critical contacts involve Leu129 in COMMD10 and the analogous Ile118 in COMMD9 ; these lie within the respective linkers between the HN and COMM domains ( Figures 3D and 3E ) . The linkers position these sidechains to reach across the tetramer interface and ﬁt into complementary pockets on the distal COMMD7 and COMMD5 subunits , respec - tively . In addition , the two HN domains themselves interact with the other three respective subunits . For clarity , we describe these two interfaces as centered around Trp157 of COMMD5 and Trp139 of COMMD7 ( Figures 3F and 3H ) , as these Trp res - idues are the only residues that are strictly conserved across all homologues and species of every COMMD protein . 42 Each of these interfaces involves the HN domain enfolding the loop between the b 1 - b 2 strands of the COMM domain from their respective dimerization partner . In this complex , the HN domain of COMMD10 enfolds the loop of the COMMD5 COMM domain , while the HN domain of COMMD9 enfolds the corresponding loop of COMMD7 . In both interfaces , a serine in the b 1 - b 2 loop forms a stacking interaction with the sidechain and a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of the strictly conserved tryptophan residue of the neighboring COMM domain ; Ser148 of COMMD7 coefﬁcients were quantiﬁed from > 30 cells per 3 independent experiments .

The COMMD proteins assemble into speciﬁc heteromeric complexes ( A ) Puriﬁcation of COMMD sub - complexes . The ten human COMMD proteins were co - expressed in E . coli and puriﬁed via His - tags on different subunits ( Methods S1 ) followed by gel ﬁltration . Peptide mass spectrometry identiﬁed the subunits co - puriﬁed with each tagged protein ( Methods S1 ) and reveals three distinct stable tetrameric complexes of COMMD1 - 6 - 4 - 8 ( subcomplex A ) , COMMD2 - 3 - 4 - 8 ( subcomplex B ) , and COMMD5 - 10 - 7 - 9 ( subcomplex C ) .

Other interactions also contribute to the speciﬁcity of each individual network ( Figures 3G – 3H ) . For example , Glu149 of COMMD7 makes a polar contact with Arg156 of COMMD5 , and Tyr84 in the COMMD10 HN domain forms a hydrogen bond with Gln191 in COMMD9 . Structure of the twelve - subunit core CCC complex To examine the role of CCDC22 and CCDC93 in COMMD inter - actions and assembly of the CCC complex , we cloned all ten hu - man COMMD proteins and CCDC22 and CCDC93 into a single biGBac construct for insect cell expression ( Methods S1 ) . StrepTactin - afﬁnity isolation revealed that CCDC93 - Strep and all other proteins were enriched in the desthiobiotin eluate , with size - exclusion chromatography revealing a single homoge - neous peak ( Methods S1 ) . Western analysis conﬁrmed a complex of all twelve proteins , with native PAGE and mass spec - trometry consistent with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry assembly ( Methods S1 ) . Estimates of the molecular mass of the entire Commander complex are broadly consistent with the predicted molecular weight ( 570 kDa ) if all subunits of Commander are present in a single copy . Puriﬁed BS3 - crosslinked CCC dodecameric complex was vitriﬁed on graphene - oxide coated grids for single particle cry - oEM ( Figure S2 ; Methods S1 ) . Data processing in CryoSPARC yielded a 3D reconstruction ( overall resolution 3 . 1 A˚ ) ( Figure S2 ; Methods S1 ; Table S1 ) . Initially , a model of the dodecamer including all ten COMMD proteins and the N - terminal regions of CCDC22 and CCDC93 was constructed using AlphaFold2 multimer 54 – 56 ( Figure S3A ) . This predicts a speciﬁc arrangement of the COMMD proteins in a heterodecameric ring , with linker regions of CCDC22 and CCDC93 between their N - terminal cal - ponin - homology ( CH ) domains and their C - terminal coiled - coil domains entwined through the COMMD assembly . The model was docked into the cryoEM map with minimal adjustments and reﬁned to produce an initial structure ( Figure S3B ) . The cen - tral ring of the COMM domains was more clearly resolved than the peripheral HN domains due to their relative ﬂexibility ( Video S2 ; Methods S1 ) . To partially address this issue , we re - pro - cessed the data in RELION4 . 0 . Several rounds of 3D particle classiﬁcation with and without alignment combined with 3D reﬁnement yielded a reconstruction with overall resolution of 3 . 5 A˚ ( Figure S2 ; Methods S1 ; Table S1 ) . The HN domains of the COMMD proteins and the CH domain of CCDC93 were bet - ter resolved in this map , albeit at lower resolution than the central coreofCOMMdomains , facilitatingfurtherreﬁnement ( FigureS2 ; Methods S1 ) . Notably , an essentially identical ab initio structure was built using the machine - learning guided modeling software Modelangelo , 67 although incomplete in many HN domains due to poorer density ( not shown ) . Although the complex studied by cryoEM includes the full - length CCDC proteins , no density is observed for the CH domain of CCDC22 or the C - terminal coiled - coil domains of either protein , indicating signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in their relative orientation to the COMMD ring . Weak density is observed for the CH domain of CCDC93 , which is sta - bilized by its interaction with the HN domain of COMMD4 . The human COMMD proteins assemble into a remarkable hetero - decameric closed ring ( Figures 4 and S3B ) . The arrangement of subunits around the ring follows a strict order of ﬁve heterodimers of ( COMMD1 - 6 ) - ( COMMD4 - 8 ) - ( COMMD2 - 3 ) - ( COMMD10 - 5 ) - ( COMMD7 - 9 ) ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . This cryoEM structure is consistent with ( i ) the COMMD10 - 5 - COMMD7 - 9 crystal structure , ( ii ) the tetrameric sub - assemblies observed in bacterial expression , and ( iii ) the complex predicted with AlphaFold2 across diverse species ( Figures S3C – S3E ) . One surface of the ring is decorated by the HN domains of COMMD1 , 4 , 2 , 10 , and 7 , while the other consists of COMMD8 , 3 , 5 , and 9 ( human COMMD6 lacks the HN domain , although it is present in other species ) ( Figure 4B ) . As seen in the crystal structure of the COMMD5 - 7 - 9 - 10 heterotetramer , the interface between each COMMD heterodimer is mediated by speciﬁc contacts involving the four adjacent protomers ( Figure S4A ) , resulting in the precise organization of the heterodecameric ring . In this structure , the CCDC22 and CCDC93 linkers make extensive contacts with the central COMM domain ring and the peripheral HN domains ( Figures 4D , S4B , and S4C ) , while the CCDC93 CH domain is partly stabilized by direct interactions withtheCOMMDringviatheHNdomainofCOMMD4 ( Figure4E ) . Two PxxR sequences in CCDC22 that form similar turn struc - tures , 145 PHLR 148 ( Figure 4F ) and 199 PVGR 202 ( Figure 4G ) , bind the HN domains of COMMD5 and COMMD3 , respectively . The extensive interactions mediated by the linker regions of the CCDC proteins appears to enhance the stability of the COMMD ring and likely explains why only tetrameric sub - com - plexes are isolated when expressing the COMMD proteins alone in E . coli ( Figure 3 ) . The structure is also consistent with trunca - tion analyses that found N - terminal regions of CCDC22 and CCDC93 could interact with COMMD proteins but not Retriever . 21 , 65 The conserved structure strongly implies that COMMD and CCDC22 / CCDC93 proteins will function strictly as a dodecameric complex in the cell . Phylogenetic analysis of the COMMD subunits CCDC22 and CCDC93 demonstrated that all twelve proteins were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor ( LECA ) , 2 with no sequence homologues identiﬁed in Archaea or Bacteria ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . This suggests the COMMD subunits likely arose by gene origination followed by gene duplication along the eukaryotic stem lineage , prior to LECA . The distribution of the ten subunits across extant eukaryotes involves parallel , lineage - speciﬁc loss in some species . These losses continued following the diversiﬁ - cation of the major eukaryotic lineages ; for example , within em - bryophytes ( land plants ) , the model tracheophyte Arabidopsis thaliana appears to have lost Commander entirely , while the bryophyte Physcomitrium patens has retained four of the ances - tral subunits ( Figure S5B ) . To further assess the interdependence of Commander sub - units , the ten human COMMD proteins were each knocked out in eHAP cells , corresponding COMMD proteins were re - ex - pressed with a C - terminal FLAG tag , immunoprecipitated , and analyzed by peptide mass spectrometry ( Figure S5C ) . When used as bait , COMMD1 , 3 , 6 , 7 , and 9 speciﬁcally isolated the entire Commander assembly , conﬁrming the overall inter - stability of the complex . In contrast we noted that COMMD2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , and 10 FLAG - tagged proteins were enriched only with speciﬁc ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 , May 11 , 2023 2225 Article A B C D E F G Figure 4 .

Examination of the CCC structure suggests that the C - terminal FLAG - tags in these COMMD sub - units may affect speciﬁc contacts with CCDC22 and CCDC93 . We speculate this leads to the loss of CCDC interactions , causing disruption of the CCC complex and loss of Retriever interaction , and further validates their importance for overall assembly . The interdependency of the COMMD and CCDC proteins for Com - mander organization provides a molecular explanation for the high degree of subunit conservation across species . DENND10 is recruited by the coiled - coil domains of CCDC22 and CCDC93 As seen previously , 6 , 16 , 20 – 22 , 68 , 69 our proteomic analyses routinely identiﬁed DENND10 as a Commander subunit ( Fig - ure S5C ) , although it is not required for Commander stability , and its deletion does not affect recycling of a 5 integrin . 21 AlphaFold2 predicted a high conﬁdence complex between DENND10 and a dimer of two central coiled - coil regions from CCDC22 and CCDC93 ( CC1 and CC2 ) ( Figures 5A and S6A ) . In this predicted structure , CCDC22 and CCDC93 form a V - shaped coiled - coil dimer bridged by conserved elements of the DENND10 DENN domain ( Figures 5A and S6B ) . Consistent with this , the CC1 - CC2 coiled - coil regions of CCDC22 and CCDC93 formed a stable dimer , which bound to recombinant DENND10 with an afﬁnity of 28 ± 6 nM ( Figure 5B ) . The formation of a high - afﬁnity trimer was also shown by size - exclusion chro - matography ( Figures 5C and S6C ) . Mutations in CCDC22 and CCDC93 within the predicted binding interface either reduced or abolished the interaction to below detectable levels ( Figure 5B ) . We further validated this complex in cells ( Figures 5D and 5E ) . GFP - tagged DENND10 was able to precipitate A B C D E Figure 5 .

Reciprocal mutations in CCDC22 and CCDC93 also perturbed cellular interaction with DENND10 , with the CCDC93 ( H406R ) and CCDC93 ( E410K ) mutations showing the strongest effect in line with the in vitro ITC measure - ments . Although DENN domains are generally thought to act as RAB GEFs , the only structure of a DENN domain - RAB complex is of DENND1B and RAB35 . 70 The DENND10 sequence is highly divergent from DENND1B , and no putative RAB effector pro - tein ( s ) have yet been identiﬁed , although there is evidence for an association with RAB27 . 69 Comparison with the DENND1B - RAB35 complex suggests that the CCDC proteins bind to DENND10 using an overlapping surface . Thus , when associated with Commander , DENND10 would be unable to engage a RAB GTPase in the same way as DENND1B with RAB35 ( Figure S6D ) . Overall structure of the holo - Commander complex and disease mutations Encouraged by the excellent agreement of experimental crystal and cryoEM structures with AlphaFold2 modeled complexes , we performed further predictions to assess how Retriever and the CCC complex assemble to form the Commander complex ( see Methods ) . Full - length CCDC22 and CCDC93 are predicted to form a heterodimer with four coiled - coil regions ( CC1 - CC4 ) in two V - shaped structures , the ﬁrst of which interacts with DENND10 ( Figure 5 ) . Our cryoEM structure shows that the N - ter - minal CH domain of CCDC93 is closely associated with the COMMD ring via the COMMD4 HN domain ( Figure 4 ) . In contrast , the CH domain of CCDC22 , ( which is not visible in the cryoEM map ) is predicted to form an intramolecular interac - tion with the two C - terminal coiled - coil regions ( CC3 - CC4 ) . Interestingly , the two CCDC proteins share distant structural similarity with IFT subunits of the intraﬂagellar transport ( IFT ) ma - chinery , which form comparable coiled - coil dimers with N - termi - nal CH domains ( Methods S1 ) . 71 , 72 After comprehensive testing of potential assemblies , we iden - tiﬁed an unambiguous interaction linking the CCC and Retriever complexes between a conserved surface on VPS35L ( opposite the VPS29 - binding site ) and the CCDC22 - CCDC93 proteins ( Methods S1 ) . This is mediated primarily by the C - terminal CC3 - CC4 coiled - coil structures with a minor interface involving the second CC2 region . By combining our experimental struc - tures with AlphaFold2 - derived models , we developed a structure of the sixteen subunit Commander complex ( Figure 6A ; Methods S1 ; Video S3 ) . The decameric COMMD ring and trimeric Retriever are tethered by the heterodimeric CCDC22 and CCDC93 proteins , with DENND10 associated at the apex of the structure . As mentioned , the interaction of the CCDC pro - teins with Retriever is mediated by the V - shaped CC3 - CC4 segment at their C terminus associating with VPS35L at a conserved surface distal from VPS26C and VPS29 . The overall shape of the complex is restrained by the predicted intramolec - ular interaction between the CCDC22 CH domain with this CCDC22 / 93 C - terminal structure . We validated the major inter - face by mutagenesis of key residues , with VPS35L ( R661A ) or VPS35L ( I710D ) and CCDC22 ( V501D ) or CCDC93 ( E503R ) all speciﬁcally perturbing Retriever and CCC complex association without affecting assembly of either subcomplex ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . In Figure S7 we plotted the electrostatic surface potential of Commander as well as surface conservation to highlight regions of likely functional importance . The electrostatic surface does not reveal any regions suggestive of binding to negatively charged phospholipid membranes . 60 , 73 , 74 In contrast , there are surfaces that show a high degree of conservation . The ﬁrst is a patch on the CCDC22 - CCDC93 coiled - coil structure , lying adja - cent to DENND10 ( Figure S7B ) aligning closely with a region required for interacting with FAM21 of the WASH complex . 65 A second pocket is formed by the interface between VPS35L and VPS26C ( Figure S7C ) . Previously , VPS26C was shown to be required for coupling to the SNX17 cargo adaptor , 6 and we speculate this pocket may be involved in SNX17 recruitment . Lastly , the surface of the CCDC93 CH domain is very highly conserved ( Figure S7D ) . Given the general actin - binding activity observed for CH domains , we speculate it might mediate cyto - skeletal interactions . Finally , we mapped mutations causative for XLID and RSS 7 – 12 onto the Commander model ( Figure 7A ) . This reveals clustering of VPS35L and CCDC22 pathogenic mutations around the inter - face between Retriever and CCC complexes , providing insight into the destabilization of protein expression observed in patients harboring these mutations . 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 CCDC22 ( Y557C ) is a highly conserved sidechain and lies directly within the interface with VPS35L . The CH domain of CCDC22 is predicted to form a key interaction with the C - terminal coiled - coil domains of CCDC22 and CCDC93 resulting in an overall compact Commander struc - ture ( Figure 6A ) , and a cluster of disease - causing mutations ( T17A , T30A , V38M , R128Q ) are predicted to destabilize this domainanditsintramolecularinteraction . VPS35Lpathogenicmu - tations A830T , Del906 , and P787L cluster toward the VPS29 inter - face and are anticipated to disrupt the C - terminal structure of the VPS35L solenoid . Unbiased interactome analysis comparing wild type VPS35L with the three mutants conﬁrmed a pronounced loss in VPS29 and CCC complex association ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast , the VPS35L ( M931Wfs * 2 ) and VPS35L ( Del437 - 461 ) mu - tants 11 retained CCC complex association but had reduced VPS29 binding ( Figure 7B ) . Taken alongside evidence that CCDC22 ( T17A ) , CCDC22 ( Y557C ) , and VPS35L ( A830T ) perturb endosomal recycling of LRP1 and LDLR and lead to hypercholes - terolemia , 11 , 65 these structural data provide a molecular explana - tion for the perturbed stability and assembly of the Commander complex associated with XLID and RSS . DISCUSSION Despite its essential role in membrane trafﬁcking and importance in disease , the molecular structure of Commander has been mostly unexplored . Our studies provide a comprehensive under - standing of how Retriever and CCC complexes are assembled and how they combine to form the Commander super - complex . The conservation of this complex conﬁrms its essential role throughout evolution , and the structure provides an atomic level description of its organization that explains previous results including the co - dependence of each of the COMMD , CCDC , and VPS35L proteins for complex stability . 13 , 28 This structure ll OPEN ACCESS 2228 Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 , May 11 , 2023 Article also indicates that each of the subunits act in unison to mediate Commander activity and implies that previous studies examining individual components of the complex , including our own , 42 may need to be re - interpreted . The structure and function of Retriever are distinct from those of Retromer Retromer is a well - characterized complex that works with different cargo adaptors including SNX3 and SNX27 to facilitate endosomal sorting . 5 Although Retriever shares similarities with Retromer , composed of related VPS35L and VPS26C subunits and the shared VPS29 protein , and associates with one diver - gent adaptor SNX17 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 15 whether it assembled or functioned in a similar manner was unclear . Our studies have shown an anal - ogous architecture ; however , Retriever is more compact and has distinct conserved surfaces that mediate speciﬁc interactions with the CCC machinery and an intrinsically unstructured N - ter - minal region that binds and regulates VPS29 .

Incor - poration of VPS29 into Retriever is therefore mutually exclusive with its ability to function in canonical Retromer - mediated trans - port , which also explains why synthetic macrocyclic peptides targeting the conserved pocket on VPS29 interact with Retromer but not Retriever . 44 In human cells , VPS29 is highly abundant , typically present at up to twice the level of other Retromer sub - units , and more than twenty times the concentration of other Commander subunits . 75 , 76 How the equilibrium between VPS29 association with either Retromer or Retriever is regulated remains an important question . The CCC complex is a unique assembly of enigmatic function The COMMD proteins have been shown to undergo homo - and heteromeric interactions using co - immunoprecipitation from cells , 6 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 28 , 40 – 42 , 68 , 77 or following pairwise co - expression in bacterial systems . 42 , 77 The proteins must form obligate dimers due to the distinct structure of their C - terminal COMM domains . 42 However , in proteomic studies , the entire set of COMMD proteins are always identiﬁed in a complex together with other Commander subunits ( this study and others 6 , 16 , 17 , 20 – 22 ) . Our data deﬁne precisely how COMMD family members interact with each other in preferred heterodimers and provide a detailed understanding of their complete assembly into a heterodecameric ring , the stability of which is dependent on interaction with CCDC22 and CCDC93 . Although there are many individual requirements for precise COMMD interactions , in general the b 1 - b 2 loop within the COMM domain of each COMMD subunit docks closely into a complementary pocket formed by the HN domain and linker of its cognate dimeric part - ner , and these interactions involve a strictly conserved trypto - phan within the C - terminal a 7 - helix of the neighboring subunit . One functional implication of the COMMD assembly is that the HN domains are positioned peripherally and appear to be primed for mediating speciﬁc intermolecular interactions . It has been proposed that the sequence divergence in the N - terminal HN do - mains could allow for distinct interactions mediated by different family members , for example with the NF - k B complex , 34 , 41 and cytoskeletal components . 78 Identifying whether speciﬁc func - tional interactions are mediated by the different COMMD sub - units remains an exciting avenue of investigation . One important ﬁnding is that stable COMMD assembly re - quires the intercalation of CCDC22 and CCDC93 linker se - quences , which make extensive contacts with different COMMD subunits to tie the assembly together . The central coiled - coil regions of the CCDC22 - CCDC93 dimer mediate recruitment of the peripheral subunit DENND10 , a member of the DENN domain family , which are generally thought to act as GEFs for RAB GTPases . 79 – 82 DENND10 localizes to late endo - somes , and its knockdown perturbs aspects of endosomal morphology and function , 21 , 69 although it appears dispensable for assembly of Commander . 21 Only one crystal structure of a DENN domain in complex with a RAB GEF substrate has been determined , 70 while the only other structures known are Longin and DENN domain - containing dimers of C9orf72 / SMCR8 and Folliculin / FNIP2 that act as RAB GAP complexes . 83 – 87 DENND10 is distinct from these , lacking key residues found in DENND1B required for GEF activity , and the interface with CCDC22 - CCDC93 would preclude RAB binding in the same re - gion . Whether DENND10 has GEF / GAP activity or plays a distinct role within the Commander complex remains to be determined . Assembly of the commander holo - complex and its role in endosomal recycling This work provides a molecular explanation for the coupling of the CCC and Retriever assemblies into the holo - Commander complex . Although our model will require full structural conﬁrma - tion , we show that mutations designed based on AlphaFold2 modeling speciﬁcally block CCC and Retriever interaction . Our data thus support the idea that while the CCC and Retriever as - semblies are distinct structures , the function of these proteins likely depends on their incorporation into the Commander holo - assembly . The CCDC proteins share some structural similarity with other CH domain - containing and coiled - coil heter - odimers , 88 predominantly involved in regulating cytoskeletal in - teractions such as with ciliary microtubules , 66 , 71 , 72 within dynein - adaptor assemblies , 89 – 91 or at the kinetochore , 92 and CH domains are often involved in direct interactions with both actin and microtubule ﬁlaments . 93 – 96 Endosomal recycling by Commander requires dynamic organization of actin - rich do - mains on the endosomal surface . 4 Endosome - associated branched actin is nucleated by Arp2 / 3 following activation by the WASH complex , which interacts with Commander subunits . 4 , 6 , 13 , 21 , 65 , 78 Given this functional connection , it is tempting to speculate that CH domain interactions could be important for establishing the actin - rich microdomains required for endosomal sorting . 4 The structure of the Commander complex has allowed us to map the locations of causative mutations for XLID and RSS . 7 – 14 Most missense mutations map to key structural ele - ments or inter - subunit interfaces , and those tested all result in signiﬁcant loss in overall Commander protein levels . In contrast , we found that deletion and frameshift mutations in VPS35L prox - imal to the VPS29 binding site speciﬁcally impact VPS29 interac - tion without seriously affecting overall Commander assembly . This shows that XLID / RSS mutations can lead to either overall Figure 7 .

Limitations of this study Our work provides the overall structural framework for analyzing Commander function in a wide array of cellular and disease - associated processes . However , while core structures of the CCC complex and the interaction of VPS29 with the N - terminal tail of VPS35L have been determined at high resolution using X - ray crystallography and cryoEM , the coiled - coil regions of the CCDC proteins remain unresolved by experimental methods , and cryoEM maps of Retriever have revealed its overall architec - ture but not its entire atomic structure . In addition , while interac - tions of the CCC complex with DENND10 and with Retriever have been mapped and experimentally validated in vitro and in situ , it will still be important to obtain high resolution experimental structures of these complexes in the future . Ultimately , puriﬁca - tion and structural studies of the full sixteen subunit Commander holo - complex will be needed to provide a complete picture of this complex , identify potential conformational rearrangements in its overall organization , and determine how it assembles on the endosomal membrane .

Parental and stable cells lines were negative for mycoplasma by DAPI staining . Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells ( Cat no . 11497013 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) for baculoviral expression of recombinant proteins in insect cells were grown at 26 (cid:3) C in Sf - 900 II SFM media ( Cat no . 10902088 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . METHOD DETAILS Cloning with biGBac plasmids Retriever and Retromer Genes for human Retriever and Retromer were codon optimized for S . frugiperda and synthesized by Twist Biosciences ( San Fran - cisco , CA ) . Codon optimised genes were cloned into pACEBAC1 . Retromer and Retriever were assembled through Gibson assembly into pBIG1A ( empty pBIG plasmids were gifts from Dr Andrew Carter , MRC - LMB , Cambridge , UK ) . 98 For TBC1D5 expression , the coding region of TBC1D5 was subcloned from pEGFP - C1 TBC1D5 into pACEBac1 . CCC complex : Genes for human CCC complex expression were codon optimized for S . frugiperda while avoiding the introduction of Pme I , Swa I , Bam H1 and Hind III restriction sites and synthesized by Twist Biosciences ( San Francisco , CA ) . Codon optimised sequences were cloned into the MultiBAC pKL transfer plasmid at the Bam HI and Hind III sites within the multiple cloning site . The CCC complex genes were assembled using the biGBac cloning strategy . 52 , 53 Plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Cat no . 27106 , Qiagen ) . BACMID PURIFICATION pACEBac1 or pBIG vectors were transformed into DH10EMBacY competent cells which contain a modiﬁed baculoviral genome . 52 Transformations were left to recover overnight before being plated onto agar plates containing 50 m g / mL kanamycin , 10 m g / mL tetracycline , 7 m g / mL gentamycin , 40 m g / mL Isopropyl b - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) and 100 m g / mL Blue - Gal ( Cat no . 15519028 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . The multigene transfer vector integrates with the baculoviral genome via Tn7 transposition . White colonies were grown overnight in 2 mL of LB supplemented with 50 m g / mL kanamycin , 10 m g / mL tetracycline , 7 m g / mL gentamycin . Bacmid DNA was prepared using buffers from a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit ( Cat no . 27106 , Qiagen ) according to the MultiBac protocol . Baculovirus generation Sf21 cells were seeded at 1x10 6 cells / well in a 6 - well plate in a total volume of 3 mL of Sf - 900 II SFM media ( Cat no . 10902088 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . Bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf21 cells using X - tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent ( Cat no . 6366244001 , Sigma - Aldrich ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and incubated at 26 (cid:3) C for 72 h . The media from the trans - fected culture was used to infect a 25 mL suspension culture of Sf21 cells at 1x10 6 cells / ml . At 48 h post proliferation arrest the V1 generation of virus was harvested by pelleting the cells at 2000 rpm for 10 min and collecting the supernatant . To amplify the infec - tivity of the virus , V1 was added to a culture of Sf21 cells and supernatant harvested - termed V2 . All viruses were stored at 4 (cid:3) C in the dark . Protein expression in insect cells For protein expression , the V1 or V2 virus were used to infect suspension cultures of Sf21 insect cells in Sf - 900 II SFM media ( Cat no . 10902088 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . Cells were seeded at 0 . 6x10 6 cells / ml in 2 L Erlenmeyer shaker ﬂasks in a total volume of 600 mL . At a density of 1x10 6 cells / ml , 6 mL of V1 or V2 was added to the culture . At 48 h post proliferation arrest cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min . Cell pellets were either immediately used for protein puriﬁcation or stored at (cid:4) 20 (cid:3) C . Retriever and TBC1D5 puriﬁcation The insect cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 25 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 2 mM b - mercaptoethanol , EDTA - free protease inhibitor tablets ( A32965 , Pierce ) ) and lysed on ice using a 130 - Watt Ultrasonic Processor ( UY - 04714 - 51 , Cole - Parmer ) for a total of 2 min 30 s using a 10 s on 30 s off cycle . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 (cid:3) C for 30 min at 18 , 000 x g . His TALON resin was used to purify his - tagged proteins . Puriﬁcation was performed at 4 (cid:3) C . TALON resin was equilibrated with lysis buffer ( 25 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 2 mM b - mercaptoethanol ) . Cleared cell lysate was then added to the column and allowed to ﬂow through the TALON resin . Once the lysate had completely ﬂowed through the column , the column was thoroughly washed in 10x CV lysis buffer , followed by 10x CV wash buffer ( 25 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 2 mM b - mercaptoethanol and 20 mM imidazole ) .

Lysates were sonicated on ice using a 130 - Watt Ultrasonic Processor ( UY - 04714 - 51 , Cole - Parmer ) for a total of 2 min 30 s using a 10 s on 30 s off cycle . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20 , 000 rpm for 25 min at 4 (cid:3) C . Cleared lysates were loaded onto a Econo - Pac Chromatography Column ( Cat no . 7321010 , Bio - Rad ) packed with 1 mL Streptactin resin ( 2 – 1201 , IBA Lifesciences ) pre - equilibrated in lysis buffer . The column was washed with 2 3 25 mL lysis buffer and bound protein eluted using 5 3 1 mL lysis buffer plus 2 . 5 mM desthiobiotin . A subset of protein containing fractions were crosslinked with 1 mM BS3 ( 11841245 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) for 2 h at 4 (cid:3) C . The reaction was quenched using 1 M Tris , pH 7 . 5 at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 mM .

Fractions of 500 m L were collected and analyzed . All puriﬁcations steps were performed at 4 (cid:3) C and samples kept on ice . Native PAGE Samples were prepared in a 1X dilution of Novex Tris - Glycine Native Sample Buffer ( 2X ) ( LC2673 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . Samples were separated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( native - PAGE ) on a Novex WedgeWell 8 to 16 % Tris - Glycine mini pro - tein gel ( XP08162BOX , Invitrogen ) . A 1X running buffer was prepared using ( 10X ) Novex Tris - Glycine Native Running Buffer and used to ﬁll the chamber of Invitrogen Mini Gel Tanks ( A25977 , Invitrogen ) . Typically , 20 m g of protein was loaded per well along with 4 m L of NativeMark Unstained Protein Standard ( LC0725 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) in one lane as a molecular weight marker . Following PAGE , the gel was washed in ddH 2 0 for 5 min . To visualise the proteins the gel was immersed in Coomassie stain , made with 0 . 1 % Coomassie Brilliant Blue R - 250 ( B7920 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 40 % methanol , 10 % acetic acid and ﬁltered through a Whatman No . 1 ﬁlter . The gel submerged in Coomassie stain was heated in a microwave for 30 s and allowed to incubate for 2 min with gentle agitation . The stain was removed and rinsed with ddH 2 0 before immersing in de - stain ( 20 % methanol ( v / v ) , 10 % acetic acid ( v / v ) in ddH 2 0 ) and microwaving for 30 s . The gel was incubated in de - staining solution until bands could be distinguished from background stain . Gels were visualised with an Odyssey infrared imaging system ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Negative stain EM 5 m g of Retriever was placed onto carbon - coated pioloform copper - mesh grids and incubated for 1 min . After the incubation , the excess protein solution was blotted and the grid was washed quickly in 4 m L 3 % uranyl acetate , blotted again and then incubated with 4 m L of 3 % uranyl acetate for 1 min . After the uranyl acetate incubation , the grids were blotted , washed a third time in uranyl acetate before blotting dry and left to air dry . Images were recorded on a 200 - kV Tecnai F20 microscope ( FEI ) equipped with a FEI Ceta 4k x 4k charge - coupled device camera at 68 , 000 magniﬁcation corresponding to a pixel size of 1 . 63 A˚ / pixel . A total of 14 , 000 particles from 280 images were picked and reference free two - dimensional classiﬁcation was performed with RELION 3 . 2 . Graphene oxide coating of EM grids Graphene oxide coated grids were prepared the day before use . Quantifoil 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 Copper 300 mesh grids were glow discharged for 1 min using an Edwards S150B Sputter coater discharger at power level 7 , 40 mA . Graphene oxide ( Sigma , 763705 , 2 mg / mL in H 2 0 ) was freshly diluted 1 / 10 to 0 . 2 mg / mL in MilliQ water . The diluted graphene oxide solution was span at 600 x g until the visible ﬂakes pelleted . 3 m L of span graphene oxide solution , taken from the top , was applied to the glow - discharged grids and incubated for 1 min . After incubation , grids were blotted with Whatman No . 1 ﬁlter paper and washed / blotted twice with 20 m L of MilliQ H 2 O and a ﬁnal wash with 20 m L of MilliQ H 2 0 was applied to the bottom of the grid .

EPU software ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) was used for automated data acquisition . Data was collected in super - resolution mode with a virtual pixel size of 0 . 525 A˚ per pixel . 4 , 862 movies were collected , with a dose rate of 61 . 7 e (cid:4) / A˚ 2 . Data collection of the CCC complex was performed on a 300 kV ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc Titan Krios transmission electron microscope with a Falcon IV direct electron detector . EPU software ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) was used for automated data acquisition . Data was collected from 2 independently prepared grids , in 2 separate sessions . The Falcon IV detector was used in counted mode with a pixel size of 1 . 084 A˚ per pixel for both data collections . The ﬁrst dataset consisting of 2871 movies was collected with a total dose 43 . 55 e (cid:4) / A˚ 2 over a total exposure time of 9 . 01 s . The second dataset , consisting of 2779 movies was collected with a total dose of 42 . 73 e (cid:4) / A˚ 2 over a total exposure time of 9 . 01 s . A range of defocus values ( (cid:4) 1 . 2 , (cid:4) 1 . 4 , (cid:4) 1 . 6 , (cid:4) 1 . 8 , (cid:4) 2 . 0 m m ) were used for collection of both datasets . Movies on the Titan Krios were collected in EER format . Cryo - EM data processing Retriever Movies were imported into RELION 4 . 0 . 108 Using the motion - correction program implemented within RELION , movies were dose - weighted , drift - corrected , gain - corrected and summed into single micrographs . A binning factor of 2 was used during motion correction , resulting in motion - corrected micrographs with a pixel size of 1 . 05 A ˚ . CTFFIND - 4 . 1 , integrated within RELION , was used to estimate the contrast transfer function ( CTF ) parameters for the motion - corrected micrographs . Micrographs with high astigma - tism values or crystalline ice were removed from the dataset . Retriever particles were manually picked , with a particle diameter of 180 A˚ until (cid:1) 3000 particles had been picked . The manually picked particles were used to train Topaz 109 which is implemented within RELION . Particles were then auto picked using the Topaz trained network . Particles with a ﬁgure - of - merit ( FOM ) value above (cid:4) 3 were extracted using a box size of 240 pixels . We then per - formed 2 rounds of reference - free 2D classiﬁcation . Following 2D classiﬁcation , we only discarded classes that did not look like they contained protein particles ( e . g . ice crystals ) . We kept all classes that looked to contain protein particles as we did not want to lose rare orientations of the particles during the 2D classiﬁcation steps . 252 , 548 particle stacks were imported into CryoSPARC V3 . 3 . 1 . 110 Initial 3D reconstructions were generated using an ab initio job with 4 classes . The resulting four 3D initial reconstructions were then used as templates in a heterologous reﬁnement with 4 classes . The map quality of resulting classes from the heterologous reﬁnement were assessed in Chimera . One class , with 119 , 564 particles , was selected for further processing . This class was reﬁned using ho - mogeneous reﬁnement followed by NU ( Non - uniform ) reﬁnement . Gold - standard Fourier Shell Correlations ( FSCs ) and directional FSC plots and measurements of sphericity ( calculated using the online 3DFSC tool ) indicate that the ﬁnal map has an overall reso - lution of (cid:1) 4 . 2 A˚ . However , this is an overestimation of the resolution of the map , as it was very clear from the reference - free 2D clas - siﬁcation classes and 3D reﬁnement jobs that Retriever particles displayed preferred orientation . The ﬁnal CryoSPARC reﬁned map does not contain particles observed from all angles , has a large deviation from the directional FSC and displays low sphericity ( 0 . 715 out of 1 ) ( Methods S1 ) . The map is therefore insufﬁcient for model building and reﬁnement . We tried unsuccessfully to overcome these preferential orientation issues by changing the sample prep , including butnot limited to ; changing buffer composition and pH ; addition of detergents ; protein concentration ; grid type ( Quantifoil copper / gold , lacey , hole size ) ; grid support ( carbon , graphene oxide ) ; freezing conditions ( blotting time , humidity , plasma cleaning time , incubation time , blot - ting equipment ( FEI Vitrobot , Leica EM GP ) ) . We also collected a tilted dataset but data processing with this dataset was unsuccess - ful ( data not shown ) . We also tried several methods of data processing in RELION / CryoSPARC to recover less frequent orientations . However , these were unsuccessful at improving the distribution of views and the overall ﬁnal map ( data not shown ) . Cryo - EM data processing the CCC complex Data processing of the CCC complex micrographs was ﬁrst performed in CryoSPARC V3 . 3 . 1 . The two movie datasets from the two independent grids were processed independently until indicated . Movies were imported into CryoSPARC and were processed using CryoSPARC’s patch motion correction . CTF estimation was achieved using CryoSPARC’s patch CTF . Particles were initially picked using the blob picker tool with a minimum particle diameter of 100 A˚ and a maximum particle diameter of 180 A˚ . Picked particles were extracted and underwent several rounds of reference - free 2D classiﬁcation . Good 2D classes were selected and used as templates for a further round of particle picking using CryoSPARC’s template picker tool . These newly picked particles were extracted and un - derwent several rounds of 2D classiﬁcation and class selection to discard any ‘bad particles’ . The best 2D classes were then used to generate ab initio reconstructions of the complex . For the ﬁrst dataset , consisting of 2 , 779 micrographs , 198 , 705 particles were used to generate 2 ab inito reconstructions . For the second dataset , consisting of 2 , 872 micrographs , 151 , 195 particles were used to generate 4 ab initio models . The ab initio models from each respective dataset were then used as templates in a hetero reﬁnement job using the same particles as the ab inito job . Following hetero reﬁnement , maps were opened in chimera and the best 3D classes were selected for further reﬁnement using homo reﬁnement and in the case of the ﬁrst dataset , a further step of NU reﬁnement . The resulting 2 reﬁned reconstructions from the 2 independent datasets ( consisting of 138 , 424 and 55 , 894 particles respectively ) were then used to create templates for a further round of particle picking , using the create template tool in CryoSPARC . Particles were picked using the templates created from their respective dataset and extracted . Particles picked and extracted from the second da - taset ( 374 , 899 ) were classiﬁed using 2D classiﬁcation and good classes ( 209 , 507 particles ) were used to train Topaz . This Topaz trained model was then used to pick particles in RELION4 . 0 ( see below ) . The extracted particles from each independent dataset ll OPEN ACCESS e9 Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 . e1 – e16 , May 11 , 2023 Article were combined to give a total of 2 , 063 , 629 particles . Good classes of particles were selected following several rounds of 2D classiﬁcation . 4 ab initio models were generated from 333 , 394 particles and these models were used as templates for a subsequent hetero reﬁnement . The classes were opened in Chimera and the best class consisting of 153 , 104 particles was chosen for homo reﬁnement followed by NU reﬁnement to give a ﬁnal reconstruction with an overall resolution of 3 . 1 A˚ . Some regions of the map were less well resolved than the central core domain ( which was very well resolved in the CryoSPARC reconstruction ) probably due to ﬂexibility of these domains relative to the core . To better resolve the ﬂexible regions of the map , we processed the data in RELION 4 . 0 . The two independent datasets were processed analogously in RELION but kept independent until stated . Micrographs were imported into RELION , dose - weighted , drift - corrected , gain - corrected and summed into single micrographs using the motion - correction program implemented within RELION . CTF estimation was done using CTFFIND - 4 . 1 within RELION . Particles were auto picked using the Topaz implementation within RELION , using the Topaz trained model from the CryoSPARC processing ( see above ) . Particles with a ﬁgure of merit above (cid:4) 1 were extracted with a box size of 264 and then binned by a factor of 4 . Particles underwent one round of 2D classiﬁcation , from which the best classes were selected and used in a 3D classiﬁcation job with 6 classes . The ﬁnal CryoSPARC map of the CCC complex ( described earlier ) was binned , imported into RELION and used as an initial model in these 3D classiﬁcation jobs . A T parameter of 4 , 40 iterations and angular sampling of 7 . 5 (cid:3) were used for the 3D classiﬁcations . 3D classes were opened in Chimera and the best 3D class was selected . Particles in this class were re - extracted without binning and then the selected particles from each independent dataset were combined to give a total of 166 , 533 particles which were then reﬁned to 4 . 2 A˚ . The particles then were subjected to one consecutive rounds of CTF reﬁnement ( beam tilt , anisotropic magniﬁcation and defocus ) , followed by Bayesian polishing 114 and 3D reﬁnement . This further improved the global resolution of the map to 4 . 1 A˚ . To improve the resolution of the densities of the ﬂexible HN domains , the angular assignments from the latest reﬁnement were used for a round of alignment - free 3D classiﬁcation , with a T parameter of 16 . The best 3D class ( 20 , 034 particles ) , which contained densities for all the HN domains as well as the CH domain of CCDC93 , was selected for a further round of 3D reﬁnement , resulting in a 3 . 8 A˚ reconstruction , which was further improved to 3 . 5 A˚ following a ﬁnal round of CTF reﬁnement and 3D reﬁnement . Model building and reﬁnement The AlphaFold2 model of the COMMD1 - 10 , CCDC22 ( 1 – 260 ) , CCDC93 ( 1 – 306 ) complex ( see below ) was docked into the sharpened RELION 4 . 0 108 map using Chimera X . 106 The docked model was then passed through PHENIX 102 real - space reﬁnement to correct Ramachandran outliers and bond angles . To improve the stereochemistry and clash score this model was reﬁned with the Chimera X plugin iSOLDE 107 and then subjected to several rounds of further reﬁnement and rebuilding using a combination of PHENIX , 102 COOT 103 and iSOLDE 107 resulting in a ﬁnal model with excellent reﬁnement statistics and stereochemistry based on Molprobity scores . All images were rendered using ChimeraX . 106 Molecular biology for E . coli expression A series of gene cassettes codon optimised for bacterial expression were synthesised by the Gene Universal Corporation ( USA ) . These were then progressively cloned into the pST39 vector to allow co - expression of all ten human COMMD family members . Brieﬂy , gene cassettes were as follows cassette 1 ( Xba I ) : COMMD1 , COMMD2 , COMMD6 ; Cassette 2 ( Hind III ) : COMMD4 ; Cassette 3 ( Eco RV ) : COMMD7 , COMMD8 , COMMD9 ; Cassette 4 ( Nru I ) : COMMD3 , COMMD5 - Strep , COMMD10 - His . Each protein contained a 5 0 ribosomal binding site and a 3 0 stop codon and were expressed off a single T7 promoter allowing the simultaneous expression of each of the ten COMMD proteins individually . The order of COMMD proteins was determined due to the internal restriction site and the required restriction sites for vector linearisation and cloning . A series of four vectors were then developed from this template to only have a singular His tag on COMMD1 , 2 and 5 . Subsequent pRSFduet co - expression vectors encoding four proteins from each of the subcomplex es Subcomplex A ( COMMD1His - 6 - 4 - 8 ) Subcomplex B ( Commd2his - 3 - 4 - 8 ) and subcomplex C ( COMMD5 - SBP - 7 - 9 - 10 - His ) , were synthetically generated by Gene Universal using the same codon optimised gene sequences . DENND10 was syn - thesized and codon optimized for E . coli expression by geneuniversal and subcloned into a pGEX6P - 1 vector ( BamHI ) . CCDC22 ( 325 – 485 ) and CCDC93 ( 310 – 488 ) were synthesized by geneuniversal and subcloned into a pRSFduet vector at BamHI and NdeI , respectively . Protein puriﬁcation from E . coli The bacterial expression plasmids were transformed into E . coli BL21 DE3 competent cells ( New England Biolabs ) and plated on agar plates containing ampicillin . Clones from this agar plate were collected and grown overnight in 10 mL LB broth , overnight ‘‘starter’’ cultures were expanded into 1 L cultures . Cultures were grown until reaching OD 600 reached 0 . 8 and induced with 0 . 8 mM isopro - pylthio - b - galactoside ( IPTG ) . Cultures were then cooled to 20 (cid:3) C and allowed to grow for (cid:1) 16 h . Cells were harvested by centrifuga - tion at 6000 x g for 5 min at 4 (cid:3) C and the harvested cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl , 5 mM Imidazole , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM n - Dodecyl - b - D - Maltopyranoside ( DDM ) , 50 m g / mL benzamidine , 100 units of DNaseI , and 2 mM b - mercaptoethanol ) . Cells were lysed using sonication and the lysate was clariﬁed by centrifugation at 50 , 000 x g for 30 min at 4 (cid:3) C . Complexes were puriﬁed on a Talon resin ( Clontech ) gravity column and eluted using 500 mM imidazole in a buffer containing 500 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , and 2 mM b - mercaptoethanol . Eluted proteins were subsequently passed through a Super - dex 200 10 / 300 column attached to an AKTA Pure system ( GE healthcare ) in 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl for crystallisation , and isothermal titration experiments ; 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl for mass photometry . For further analysis by MS COMMD ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 . e1 – e16 , May 11 , 2023 e10 Article complexes isolated using Talon were passed through SEC in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 and 30 mM NaCl and further puriﬁed using a mono Q anion exchange chromatography column with a gradient running from 30 mM NaCl to 500 mM NaCl . Wild type and mutant com - plexes of CCDC22 ( 325 – 485 ) and CCDC93 ( 310 – 488 ) contained an amino - terminal decaHis tag on CCDC93 and was co - expressed using the pRSF - duet vector , expression and puriﬁcation were as above . DENND10 was expressed as above and puriﬁed in the same manner except talon resin was substituted for glutathione resin ( Clontech ) . uHPLC - mass spectrometry COMMD complexes puriﬁed by size exclusion chromatography and anion exchange chromatography were trypsinised at a ratio of 1 : 100 ( trypsin : protein ) overnightat37 (cid:3) CandanalyzedbyuHPLC - MS / MSonanEksigent , EkspertnanoLC400uHPLC ( SCIEX , Canada ) coupled to a Triple TOF 6600 mass spectrometer ( SCIEX , Canada ) equipped with a duo microelectrospray ion source . 5 m L of each extract was injected onto a 300 m m 3 150 mm ChomXP C18 CL 3 m m column ( SCIEX , Canada ) at 5 m L / min . Linear gradients of 2 – 25 % solvent B over 35 min at 5 m L / min ﬂow rate , followed by a steeper gradient from 25 % to 60 % solvent B in 15 min were used for peptide elution . The gradient was then extended from 60 % solvent B to 80 % solvent B in 2 min . Solvent B was held at 80 % for 3 min for washing the column and returned to 2 % solvent B for equilibration prior to the next sample injection . Solvent A consisted of 0 . 1 % formic acid in water and solvent B contained 0 . 1 % formic acid in acetonitrile . The ion spray voltage was set to 5500V , declus - tering potential ( DP ) 90V , curtain gas ﬂow 25 , nebuliser gas 1 ( GS1 ) 13 , GS2 to 15 , interface heater at 150 (cid:3) C and the turbo heater to 150 (cid:3) C . The mass spectrometer acquired 250ms full scan TOF - MS data followed by up to 30 3 50ms full scan product ion data in an Information DependentAcquisition , IDA , mode .

Thedatawasacquiredandprocessed using Analyst TF 1 . 7 software ( ABSCIEX , Canada ) . Protein identiﬁcation was carried out using Protein Pilot 5 . 0 for database searching . Mass photometry Microscope coverslips were washed and inserted into a Refeyn mass photometry instrument ( Refeyn Ltd . , UK ) in the Center for Mi - croscopy and Microanalysis ( CMM ) . All protein complexes were in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 and 500 mM NaCl , and all buffers were ﬁltered through a 0 . 22 m M ﬁlter . Calibration was preformed using a mass calibrant purchased from Sigma - Aldrich that contained bovine serum albumin , alcohol dehydrogenase and b - amylase . 6000 frames were collected for each protein and analyzed using the Refeyn provided software . Brieﬂy , movies record light scattering events as proteins interaction with the coverslips and the amount of light scattered is quantiﬁed and a histogram . Gaussian distributions were then ﬁtted to each peak to determine the molecular weights . Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) The afﬁnities of VPS29 interaction with the synthetic VPS35L peptides and DENND10 with the CCDC22 ( 325 – 485 ) and CCDC93 ( 310 – 488 ) complex and associated mutants was determined using a Microcal PEAQ instrument ( Malvern , UK ) . Experiments we performed in 100 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 300 mM NaCl . Native and mutant VPS35L peptides at 600 m M were titrated into 20 m M of VPS29 , while 50 m M of DENND10 was titrated into 10 m M of wild type and mutant CCDC22 and CCDC93 complexes . In both cases in 13 x 3 . 22 m L aliquots were used at a temperature of 25 (cid:3) C . The dissociation constants ( K d ) , enthalpy of binding ( D H ) and stoichiometries ( N ) were obtained after ﬁtting the integrated and normalised data to a single site binding model . The apparent binding free energy ( D G ) and entropy ( D S ) were calculated from the relationships D G = RTln ( K d ) and D G = D H - T D S . All experiments were performed at least in triplicate to check for reproducibility of the data . SPARSE matrix crystal screening COMMD subcomplex C was puriﬁed and concentrated to (cid:1) 8 mg / mL for crystallization screening . Three commercially available SPARSE matrix hanging - drop crystal screens ( LMB , PEGRX , JCSG + ) were setup using a Mosquito liquid handling robot ( TTP LabTech ) at 20 (cid:3) C . Numerous crystal conditions were obtained for COMMD subcomplex C and an initial optimisation screen was per - formed to determine the best crystallisation conditions . The largest crystals were obtained when the protein solution was supple - mented with 2 m M crown ether and 10 % glycerol and grown in 22 % ethanol and 5 mM EDTA . This condition was optimised in a 24 well vapor diffusion plate on glass cover slips by hanging drop , mixing 5 m L protein with 1 m L reservoir solution . Crystals were relatively small with a diamond - shaped morphology ( maximum dimensions (cid:1) 50 m m ) . For data collection crystals were cryo - pro - tected in reservoir solution containing 25 % glycerol for 10 s prior to ﬂash - cooling in liquid nitrogen . Likewise , VPS29 was concen - trated to 16 mg / mL and incubated with 10 mM of the VPS35L peptide ( 16 EFASCRLEAVPLEFGDYHPLKPI 38 ; Genscript , USA ) . Using the same SPARSE matrix screens , and crystals were obtained in JCSG + H3 ( 0 . 1 M Bis - tris pH 5 . 5 and 25 % ( w / v ) PEG3350 ) . 24 well trays using the same solution resulted in large rod - shaped crystals . For data collection crystals were cryo - protected in reservoir solution containing 20 % glycerol for 10 s prior to ﬂash - cooling in liquid nitrogen . Crystallographic structure determination Data was collected at the Australian synchrotron on the MX2 beamline . The data was integrated with XDS 99 and scaled with AIMLESS 100 in the CCP4 suite . 115 Initially the structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER 101 within the ll OPEN ACCESS e11 Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 . e1 – e16 , May 11 , 2023 Article PHENIX suite . 102 For subcomplex C the templates used for molecular replacement searches were the available COMM domain dimer of COMMD9 ( PDB : 6BP6 ) , 42 the HN domain of COMMD9 ( PDB : 4OE9 ) 42 and the HN domain of COMMD10 ( unpublished ) . From anal - ysis of the unit cell volume and Matthews Coefﬁcient using XTRIAGE , 102 it was estimated that a single copy of the COMMD5 - 7 - 9 - 10 tetramer was present in the asymmetric unit . PHASER was able to successfully place four copies of the COMMD9 COMM domain , one copy of the COMMD9 HN domain and one copy of the COMMD10 HN domain . The resulting model and electron density was sufﬁcient to unambiguously determine the identities of each individual COMM domain . These COMM domains were rebuilt in COOT 103 allowing clear deﬁnition of the core heterotetramer of the COMMD5 - 7 - 9 - 10 COMM domains in the structure . Electron den - sity for the two HN domains positioned by PHASER was relatively poor but they could be identiﬁed conﬁdently as belonging to COMMD9 and COMMD10 based on their connectivity to the core COMM domains of these two subunits . Further reﬁnement and rebuilding using a combination of PHENIX , COOT and the ChimeraX plugin , ISOLDE resulted in a ﬁnal model with excellent reﬁne - ment statistics and stereochemistry based on Molprobity scores . Despite the quality of the ﬁnal structure and resulting maps , no electron density was observed for the N - terminal HN domains of either COMMD5 or COMMD7 . This is likely due to ﬂexibility in the orientation of these domains . VPS29 bound to the VPS35L peptide was solved using the same method as above , however we used the AlphaFold2 predicted structure of the complex as the input template for molecular replacement . AlphaFold2 modeling All protein models were generated using AlphaFold2 Multimer 54 , 55 implemented in the ColabFold interface available on the Google Colab platform . 56 A ﬁnal Commander model was compiled by combining 3 models each of (cid:1) 2000 aa ( the current limit of this plat - form ) . The models were as follows : COMMD1 - 10 + CCDC22 ( 1 – 223 ) , COMMD1 - 10 + CCDC93 ( 1 – 300 ) ; CCDC22 + CCDC93 + DENND10 ; VPS29 + VPS26C + VPS35L ; VPS35L + CCDC22 ( 1 – 115 ; 368 – 627 ) + CCDC93 ( 378 – 630 ) ( see Figure S13 ) . Typically , three independent models were generated for each complex and the quality of the predicted complexes was assessed by examining mul - tiple outputs including the iPTM scores ( conﬁdence scores for interfacial residues ) , predicted alignment error ( PAE ) plots , and ﬁnally a visual inspection of how well the resulting structures aligned with each other in PyMol . Notably , the various complexes invariably dis - played highly consistent interfaces across multiple predictions . To generate the ﬁnal assembled Commander complex , we merged the various predicted structures into a single PDB ﬁle , and then models for which we had experimental structures ( COMMD1 - 10 + CCDC22 + CCDC93 , VPS29 + VPS35L peptide , and VPS29 + VPS26C + VPS35L ) were substituted where appropriate . This complete model was then reﬁned using Phenix to ﬁx various stereochemistry parameters including bond length and Ramachandra outliers to produce a ﬁnal model . Similarly , we generated analogous complexes using AlphaFold2 implemented in ColabFold to model struc - tures of the Danio rerio ( zebraﬁsh ) and Salpingoeca rosetta ( single cell choanoﬂagellate ) . These were entirely consistent with the pre - dicted human complex . Cell lines Human cell lines ( HeLa , HEK293T , and RPE1 ) were cultured in humidiﬁed incubators at 37 (cid:3) C , 5 % CO 2 in DMEM ( Sigma , Catalog number D5796 ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( Sigma , catalog number F7524 ) and penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco ) . Generation of HeLa Retriever KO cell lines VPS35 knock - out HeLa cells were previously generated . 97 To generate VPS29 or VPS35L KO HeLa cells , gRNAs targeting genes of interest were designed using the Broad Institute GPP sgRNA Designer and cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP ( PX458 ) . HeLa cells were transfected with 2 m g pX458 using FuGene , according to manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were incubated for 24 h before cells were sorted for GFP expression by FACS . Single cells were deposited into 96 well plates containing Iscove’s modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and Penicillin / Streptomycin . Single cell clones were expanded and screened for gene KO by lysis and Western blotting . Generation of eHAP COMMD KO cell lines Human eHap cells were obtained from Horizon Discovery . Cells were cultured in Iscove 0 s Modiﬁed Dulbecco 0 s Medium ( IMDM ) sup - plemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal calf serum ( FCS ; CellSera ) , and penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco ) at 37 (cid:3) C under an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Constructs for CRISPR - Cas9 genome editing were designed using the CHOPCHOP website 116 and oligonucleotides encoding gRNA sequences cloned into the pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP ( PX458 ) plasmid ( a gift from F . Zhang 117 ; Addgene , plasmid 48138 ) as pre - viously described . 118 The gRNA sequences and targeting loci are described in STAR Methods . Constructs were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) according to manufacturer’s instructions , and single GFP positive cells sorted into 96 well plates .

For generation of FLAG - tagged cell lines , inserts containing cDNA sequences were commercially synthesized ( IDT tech - nologies ) to contain a C - terminal FLAG tag and compatible overhangs for Gibson assembly . Inserts were combined with pBABE - puro plasmid ( Addgene , 1764 ) cut with BamHI - HF and HindIII - HF restriction enzymes ( NEB ) and Gibson assembled using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly System ( NEB ) as per manufacturer’s instructions . Retroviral particles were made in HEK293T cells using pUMVC3 and pCMV - VSV - G ( Addgene , 8449 and 8454 ) packaging plasmids as previously described . Viral supernatant was collected ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 . e1 – e16 , May 11 , 2023 e12 Article at 48 h post - transfection , ﬁltered with 0 . 45 m m PVDF membrane ( Milipore ) and combined with 8 m g mL (cid:4) 1 polybrene for transduction . Infected cells were selected using 2 m g mL (cid:4) 1 puromycin , and transduction veriﬁed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Molecular cloning of VPS35L - GFP To generate VPS35L - GFP , VPS35L was subcloned into the EGFP - N1 or lentiviral pLVX vector . VPS35L was ampliﬁed using Q5 High - Fidelity 2X Master Mix ( NEB , M0492 ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Following PCR , bands were resolved on agarose gel and puriﬁed with GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band puriﬁcation kit ( GE Healthcare , 28 - 9034 - 70 ) . Ampliﬁed gene or 1 m g of plasmid backbone were then digested using appropriate restriction enzymes ( 1 . 5 m L ) , and the plasmid backbone was additionally treated with 1 . 5 m L of quick - CIP ( NEB , M0525 ) to prevent self - ligation . Digestion reaction was carried out in 1x CutSmart buffer and nuclease - free water in a ﬁnal volume of 40 m L at 37 (cid:3) C for 1 h . Digestion products were puriﬁed as previous and 50 m g of backbone and 6 - times excess of insert were then used for ligation using T4 DNA ligase ( Invitrogen , 15224017 ) . Site - directed mutagenesis Primers for site - directed mutagenesis were designed using Agilent QuikChange Primer design tool . PCR reactions were carried out using QuikChange II Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent , 200523 - 5 ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . After PCR , non - mutated template vector was removed from the PCR mixture through digestion for 1 h at 37 (cid:3) C by the enzyme Dpn1 . Following diges - tion by Dpn1 , 4 m L of the mixture was transformed into XL10 Gold ( Agilent , 200315 ) chemically competent cells and plated on suitable antibiotic - containing agar plates . Sequencing of puriﬁed plasmid DNA established whether the desired mutation had been introduced . Gibson assembly NEBuilder Assembly Tool was used to design primers for Gibson Assembly reactions . The fragments were ampliﬁed using overlap - ping primers . 0 . 02 pmol of pLVX _ Puro digested with EcoRI and BamHI and (cid:4) 0 . 04 - 0 . 06 pmol PCR - ampliﬁed fragments were mixed with Gibson Assembly 2x Master Mix ( NEB , E2611 ) according to manufacturer’s instructions and incubated for 1h at 50 (cid:3) C . 2 m L of the reaction was transformed into NEB 5 - alpha Competent E . coli ( NEB , C2987H ) cells . Transfection and transduction of cell lines PEI ( polyethyleneimine ) was used to transfect HEK293T cells with constructs for GFP / mCherry traps or to produce lentivirus . An aqueous 10 m g / mL stock of linear 25 kDa PEI ( Polysciences , catalog number 23966 - 2 ) was used for transfections . For 10 cm or 15 cm , 2 . 5 mL or 5 mL of Opti - MEM was added to 2 separate sterile tubes respectively . In the ﬁrst Opti - MEM containing tube , 10 m g or 15 m g DNA was added for 10 cm or 15 cm dishes respectively . To the second tube , 3 : 1 PEI : DNA ratio was added and the contents vortexed . The Opti - MEM / PEI mixture was then ﬁlter sterilised by ﬁltering through a 0 . 2 m m ﬁlter . The sterilised PEI / Opti - MEM was then added to the Opti - MEM / DNA mixture and the tube was mixed by vortexing . The mixture was left to incubate at room temperature for 20 min . Following incubation , HEK293T cells were washed in PBS , then PBS was removed and the trans - fection mixtures were carefully added to the cell dishes . HEK293T cells were incubated with the transfection mixture , under normal growth conditions , for 4 h . The transfection media was removed at the end of the incubation period and replaced with normal growth media . Cells were further incubated for another 24 / 48 h prior to experimental use . To generate lentivirus , a 15 cm dish of HEK293T cells were transfected with 15 m g of PAX2 , 5 m g pMD2 . G and 20 m g of lentiviral expression vector using PEI as described above . After the 48 h incubation , the growth media containing the lentivirus was harvested and ﬁltered through a 0 . 45 m m ﬁlter . Cells to be trans - duced were seeded at 50 , 000 cells per well of a 6 - well plate and left to settle prior to addition of lentivirus . GFP / mCherry nanotraps Dishes containing cells expressing GFP / mCherry or GFP / mCherry tagged proteins ( either transiently or stably ) were placed on ice . The cell media was removed and the cells were washed three times with ice - cold PBS ( Sigma ) . Cells were lysed with lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM potassium acetate , 1 mM EDTA , 200 mM D - sorbitol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1x protease cocktail inhibitor , pH7 . 5 or 50mM Tris pH7 . 5 with 0 . 5 % NP - 40 in PBS with protease inhibitors ) . 500 m L or 1 mL of lysis buffer was used per 10 cm or 15 cm dish respectively . Lysis was aided through the use of a cell scraper . The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 13 , 200 rpm for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C . 15 m L of GFP - trap beads ( Chromotek , catalog number gta - 20 ) or mCherry - trap beads ( Chromotek , catalog number rta - 20 ) were pre - equilibrated in lysis buffer , through three rounds of washing in lysis buffer , prior to adding cleared cell lysate . 10 % of cell lysate was retained for input analysis . Trap beads and lysates were incubated together on a rocker at 4 (cid:3) C for 1 h . Following incubation , Trap beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm , for 30 s at 4 (cid:3) C . Supernatant was then removed , and beads were either washed a further three times in 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM potassium acetate , 1 mM EDTA , 200 mM D - sorbitol , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1x protease cocktail inhibitor , pH7 . 5 or twice in 50 mM Tris pH7 . 5 with 0 . 25 % NP - 40 in PBS with protease inhib - itors and once with 50mM Tris pH7 . 5 in PBS with protease inhibitors through rounds of re - suspension and pelleting . After the ﬁnal wash , all lysis buffer was removed from the Trap beads .

Polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes ( Immobilon - FL ; EMD Millipore , USA ) were used for transfer with protein detection quantiﬁed using the Odyssey infrared scanning system ( LI - COR Biosciences , USA ) and ﬂuo - rescently labeled secondary antibodies . We routinely performed western blot quantiﬁcation where a single blot is simultaneously probed with distinct antibody species targeting proteins of interest followed by visualisation of secondary antibodies conjugated with distinct spectral dyes . All quantiﬁed western blots are the mean of at least 3 independent experimental repeats , with statistical analysis performed using Prism 7 ( GraphPad Software , USA ) . All quantitation of western blots is shown in Data S1 . Biotinylation of cell surface proteins Fresh Sulfo - NHS - SS Biotin ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc , no . 21217 ) was dissolved in 4 (cid:3) C PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) at 0 . 2 mg / mL prior to incubating with prewashed ( twice with ice - cold PBS ) cells placed on ice to reduce the rate of endocytosis and endocytic pathway ﬂux . Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 (cid:3) C , followed by incubation in TBS for 10 min to quench the biotinylation reaction . Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer and subjected to Streptavidin bead - based afﬁnity isolation ( GE Healthcare , USA ) . Immunoﬂuorescence staining Cells were seeded onto sterile 13mm glass coverslips . Once cells were ready to be ﬁxed , growth media was aspirated off and cells were washed three times in PBS prior to ﬁxation in 4 % PFA ( w / v ) ( paraformaldehyde , Pierce 16 % Formaldehyde ( w / v ) , Methanol - free , catalog number 28906 , diluted to 4 % ( w / v ) in PBS ) . Cells were incubated in 4 % PFA for 20 min at room temperature . Coverslips were then washed a further 3 times in PBS . For permeabilization , coverslips were incubated in 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature . Alternatively , if the cells were going to be stained for LAMP1 , cells were permeabilised in 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) saponin in PBS for 5 min . After permeabilization , coverslips were then washed a further 3 times in PBS . Coverslips were blocked for 15 minin 1 % ( w / v ) BSA in PBS at room temperature . Primary antibodies were diluted in 1 % ( w / v ) BSA in PBS ( for Triton X - 100 permeabilised cells ) or 1 % ( w / v ) BSA , 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) saponin in PBS . 60 m L of diluted antibody solution was pipetted onto a strip of Paraﬁlm as a dot . Cov - erslips were inverted and placed onto the dots so that the cells were immersed into the antibody solution . Coverslips were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature . Coverslips were then washed three times in PBS before placing onto 60 m L dots containing Alexa Fluor - conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI ( if required , 0 . 5 m g / mL ) for 1 h at room temperature , then washed 3 times in PBS and once in water . Coverslips were mounted onto glass microscope slides in Fluoromount - G ( Invitrogen , 004958 - 02 ) . Confocal microscopy Fixed cells were imaged at room temperature using a Leica SP5 , Leica SP5 - II or Leica SP8 multi - laser confocal microscope . A 63x NA 1 . 4 UV oil - immersion lens was used to take all images . Leica LCS or LAS X software was used for the acquisition of images . Coloc - alisation analysis was performed in Volocity 6 . 3 . 1 software ( PerkinElmer ) with automatic Costes background thresholding . Mass spectrometry of FLAG - COMMDs Cell pellets ( triplicate sub - cultures representing each cell line ) were harvested by scraping and washed in PBS ( 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) . Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce Protein Assay Kit ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) , following which 1 mg of material was solubilized for afﬁnity enrichment mass spectrometry ( AEMS ) as previously described . Brieﬂy , cell pellets were solubilized in 20mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 4 , 50mM NaCl , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0 . 1mM EDTA , 1 % ( w / v ) digitonin and 125 units of benzonase ( Merck ) and soluble material loaded onto Pierce Spin Columns ( ThermoFisher Scien - tiﬁc ) containing anti - FLAG M2 afﬁnity gel ( Sigma ) pre - equilibrated with 20mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 4 , 60mM NaCl , 10 % v / v glycerol , 0 . 5mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % w / v digitonin . Following a 2 h incubation at 4 (cid:3) C , columns were washed with the same buffer and enriched protein com - plexes eluted with the addition of 100 m g mL (cid:4) 1 FLAG peptide ( Sigma ) . Eluates were acetone precipitated and precipitates resus - pended in 8 M urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate ( ABC ) . Proteins were reduced and alkylated by incubation at 37 (cid:3) C for 30 min with 10 mM tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine hydrochloride ( TCEP ; Bondbreaker , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) and 50 mM chloroa - cetamide ( Sigma Aldrich ) , following which samples were diluted to 2 M urea using 50 mM ABC prior to digestion with 1 m g of trypsin ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) at 37 (cid:3) C overnight .

For COMMD1 FLAG , COMMD6 FLAG , and COMMD9 FLAG and parental eHap1 cell lines , eluates prepared as above were analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap Elite ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) in conjunction with an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano HPLC ( Dionex Ultimate 3000 ) using the liquid chromatography ( LC ) and mass spectrometry instrument parameters previously described . 120 The basic LC setup consisted of a trap column ( Dionex - C18 trap column 75 m m 3 2 cm , 3 m m , particle size , 100 A ˚ pore size ; ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) run at 5 m L / min before switching the pre - column in line with the analytical column ( Dionex - C18 analytical column 75 m m 3 50 cm , 2 m m particle size , 100 A ˚ pore size ; ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . The separation of peptides was performed at 300 nL / min using a 95 min non - linear ACN gradient of buffer A [ 0 . 1 % formic acid , 2 % ACN , 5 % DMSO ] and buffer B [ 0 . 1 % formic acid in ACN , 5 % DMSO ] . Mass spectrometry data were collected in Data Dependent Acquisition ( DDA ) mode using m / z 300 – 1650 as MS scan range , rCID for MS / MS of the 20 most intense ions . Lockmass of 401 . 92272 from DMSO was used . Other instrument parameters were : MS scan at 100 , 000 resolution , ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 . e1 – e16 , May 11 , 2023 e14 Article maximum injection time 150 ms , AGC target 1 E 6 , CID at 30 % energy for a maximum injection time of 150 ms with AGC target of 5000 . Dynamic exclusion with of 30 s was applied for repeated precursors . For COMMD2 FLAG , COMMD4 FLAG , COMMD5 FLAG , COMMD7 FLAG , COMMD8 FLAG , COMMD10 FLAG and parental eHap1 cell lines , eluates were analyzed on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 Thermo Scientiﬁc ) in conjunction with an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanoHPLC ( Dionex Ultimate 3000 ) using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry instrument parameters previously described . 120 The LC setup was identical to that described above , except that for COMMD2 FLAG , COMMD4 FLAG , COMMD5 FLAG , COMMD7 FLAG , COMMD8 FLAG and parental control , the non - linear ACN gradient used for the separation of peptides was 65 min in length . Mass spectrometry was conducted in data - dependent acquisition mode , whereby full MS1 spectra were acquired in a positive mode at 120000 resolution using a scan range of 300 – 1600 m / z . The ‘top speed’ acquisition mode with 3 s cycle time on the most intense precursor ion was used , whereby ions with charge states of 2 – 6 were selected . MS / MS analyses were performed by 1 . 2 m / z isolation with the quadrupole , fragmented by HCD with collision energy of 30 % . MS2 resolution was at 15000 . AGC target was set to standard with auto maximum injection mode . Dynamic exclusion was acti - vated for 20 s . Afﬁnity enrichment mass spectrometry data were analyzed using the MaxQuant 121 and Perseus 122 platforms as previously described for similar data in . 123 In brief , raw mass spectrometry data from each batch of AEMS experiments were separately analyzed in MaxQuant with the data combined during workup in Perseus . Default MaxQuant search parameters were used with ‘‘Label free quantitation’’ set to ‘‘LFQ’’ and ‘‘Match between runs’’ enabled . Trypsin / P cleavage speciﬁcity ( cleaves after lysine or arginine , even when proline is present ) was used with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages . Oxidation of methionine and N - terminal acetylation were speciﬁed as variable modiﬁcations . Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation . A search tolerance of 4 . 5 ppm was used for MS1 and 20 ppm for MS2 matching . False discovery rates ( FDR ) were determined through the target - decoy approach set to 1 % for both peptides and proteins . The MaxQuant ProteinGroups . txt output tables were imported into Perseus and LFQ intensities were log2 transformed . Values listed as being ‘‘Only identiﬁed by site , ’’ ‘‘Reverse , ’’ or ‘‘Contami - nants’’ were removed from the dataset . Experimental groups were assigned to each set of triplicates and the number of valid values for each row group calculated . For each experiment ( containing a control and an enrichment group ) , single replicates with signiﬁcant variation as evident through a principal component analysis ( PCA ) were removed , along with rows having less than 2 valid values in the enrichment group . Missing values in the relevant control group were imputed to values consistent with the limit of detection . A two - sided , two - sample Student’s t test was performed between control and each enrichment group , with the resulting data plotted on volcano plot . The threshold of signiﬁcant enrichment was set to 2 - fold ( log2 fold change = 1 ) based on the distribution of unen - riched proteins quantiﬁed . TMT labeling and high pH RP chromatography The samples were reduced ( 10 mM TCEP , 55 (cid:3) C for 1 h ) , alkylated ( 18 . 75 mM iodoacetamide , room temperature for 30 min ) and then digested from the beads with trypsin ( 2 . 5 m g trypsin ; 37 (cid:3) C , overnight ) . The resulting peptides were then labeled with TMT seven - plex reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc , Loughborough , LE11 5RG , UK ) and the labeled samples pooled and desalted using a SepPak cartridge according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Waters , Milford , Massachusetts , USA ) . Eluate from the SepPak cartridge was evaporated to dryness and resuspended in buffer A ( 20 mM ammonium hydroxide , pH 10 ) prior to fractionation by high pH reversed - phase chromatography using an Ultimate 3000 liquid chromatography system ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . In brief , the sample was loaded onto an XBridge BEH C18 Column ( 130 A˚ , 3 . 5 m m , 2 . 1 mm 3 150 mm , Waters , UK ) in buffer A and peptides eluted with an increasing gradient of buffer B ( 20 mM Ammonium Hydroxide in acetonitrile , pH 10 ) from 0 to 95 % over 60 min . The resulting fractions ( 5 in total ) were evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 1 % formic acid prior to analysis by nano - LC MSMS using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Nano - LC mass spectrometry High pH RP fractions were further fractionated using an Ultimate 3000 nano - LC system in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . In brief , peptides in 1 % ( v / v ) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano - trap column ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . After washing with 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) formic acid peptides were resolved on a 250 mm 3 75 m m Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) over a 150 min organic gradient , using 7 gradient segments ( 1 – 6 % solvent B over 1 min , 6 – 15 % B over 58 min , 15 – 32 % B over 58 min , 32 – 40 % B over 5 min , 40 – 90 % B over 1 min , held at 90 % B for 6 min and then reduced to 1 % B over 1min ) with a ﬂow rate of 300 nL min (cid:4) 1 . Solvent A was 0 . 1 % formic acid and Solvent B was aqueous 80 % acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % formic acid . Peptides were ionized by nano - electrospray ionization at 2 . 0 kV using a stainless - steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 m m ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) and a capillary temperature of 275 (cid:3) C . All spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2 . 1 software ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) and oper - ated in data - dependent acquisition mode using an SPS - MS3 workﬂow . FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of 120 , 000 , with an automatic gain control ( AGC ) target of 200 , 000 and a max injection time of 50 ms . Precursors were ﬁltered with an intensity threshold of 5000 , according to charge state ( to include charge states 2 – 7 ) and with monoisotopic peak determination set to peptide . Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window ( 60s + / (cid:4) 10 ppm ) . The MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole isolation window of 1 . 2 m / z . ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGC target of 10 , 000 , max injection time of 70ms and CID collision energy of 35 % . For FTMS3 analysis , the Orbitrap was operated at 50 , 000 resolution with an AGC target of 50 , 000 and a max injection time of 105 ms .

Synchronous Precursor Selection ( SPS ) was enabled to include up to 10 MS2 fragment ions in the FTMS3 scan . Proteomic data analysis The raw data ﬁles were processed and quantiﬁed using Proteome Discoverer software v2 . 1 ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) and searched against the UniProt Human database ( downloaded January 2021 ; 169297 sequences ) using the SEQUEST HT algorithm . Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm , and MS / MS tolerance was set at 0 . 6 Da . Search criteria included oxidation of methionine ( + 15 . 995Da ) , acetylation of the protein N - terminus ( + 42 . 011Da ) and Methionine loss plus acetylation of the protein N - terminus ( (cid:4) 89 . 03Da ) as variable modiﬁcations and carbamidomethylation of cysteine ( + 57 . 021Da ) and the addition of the TMT mass tag ( + 229 . 163Da ) to peptide N - termini and lysine as ﬁxed modiﬁcations . Searches were performed with full tryptic digestion and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed . The reverse database search option was enabled and all data was ﬁltered to satisfy false discovery rate ( FDR ) of 5 % . Phylogenetic analyses Representative sequences of CCDC22 , CCDC93 , COMMD1 , COMMD2 , COMMD3 , COMMD4 , COMMD5 , COMMD6 , COMMD7 , COMMD8 , COMMD9 and COMMD10 were used to construct HMM proﬁlers ( HMMER 3 . 3 . 2 ) which were then searched against 30 proteomes from a representative selection of organisms ( from RefSeq 124 and GenBank 125 ) with an E - value threshold of 1 3 10 (cid:4) 5 . Duplicate COMMD sequences were removed , and representative query sequences were added ( for identiﬁcation of each different COMMD protein ) before sequences were aligned using MAFFT L - INS - i ( v7 . 505 ) , 111 with separate alignments for CCD22 , CCD93 and one alignment for all 10 COMMD proteins . Maximum likelihood trees were then inferred using IQTree ( details below ) and manually inspected , and outgroups to the COMMD10 , CCD22 and CCD93 clades were removed from the unaligned sequence sets before alignment and subsequent tree inference . All maximum likelihood trees were inferred under the best - ﬁtting model accord - ing to the Bayesian Information Criterion implemented in ModelFinder ( part of IQTree2 . 1 . 3 112 ) , including complex models allowing for across - site compositional heterogeneity ( - m MFP - madd LG + C60 + F + G , LG + C50 + F + G , LG + C40 + F + G , LG + C30 + F + G , LG + C20 + F + G , LG + C10 + F + G , LG + F + G , LG + R + F – score - diff ALL ) . Each tree was inferred with 10 , 000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates . The best - ﬁtting models were Q . yeast + R5 for the COMMD1 - 10 tree , LG + C20 + F + G for CCD22 , and Q . insect + F + I + G4 for CCD93 . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS For data analysis of FLAG - tagged COMMD subunit mass spectrometry experiments , raw ﬁles were analyzed using the MaxQuant platform , 126 version 1 . 6 . 10 . 43 against canonical , reviewed and isoform variants of human protein sequences in FASTA format ( Uniprot , January 2019 ) . The default settings : ‘‘LFQ’’ and ‘‘Match between runs’’ were enabled . N - terminal acetylation and methio - nine oxidation were set as variable modiﬁcations while cysteine carbamidomethylation was speciﬁed as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation . Computation of protein enrichment was performed in Perseus ( version 1 . 6 . 10 . 43 ) . 122 Peptides labeled by MaxQuant as ‘only iden - tiﬁed by site’ , ‘reverse’ or ‘potential contaminant’ were removed and only those proteins quantiﬁed based on > 1 unique peptide were considered for further analysis . LFQ intensities were log2 transformed and rows having less than 3 valid values in the enrichment group were removed and the missing values in the control group were imputed to values consistent with the limit of detection . The mean log 2 LFQ intensities for proteins detected in each experimental group , along with p values , were calculated using a two - sided two - tailed t - test . Signiﬁcance was determined by permutation - based FDR statistics 122 where the s0 factor was iteratively modiﬁed to exclude all identiﬁcations enriched in the control experiment , yielding an s0 of 1 at 1 % FDR . For quantitation of Western blots protein detection was performed using the Odyssey infrared scanning system ( LI - COR Biosci - ences , USA ) and ﬂuorescently labeled secondary antibodies . We routinely performed western blot quantiﬁcation where a single blot is simultaneously probed with distinct antibody species targeting proteins of interest followed by visualisation of secondary anti - bodies conjugated with distinct spectral dyes . All quantiﬁed western blots are the mean of at least 3 independent experimental re - peats , with statistical analysis performed using Prism 7 ( GraphPad Software , USA ) . Colocalisation analysis of ﬂuorescently labeled proteins was performed in Volocity 6 . 3 . 1 software ( PerkinElmer ) with automatic Costes background thresholding . ll OPEN ACCESS Cell 186 , 2219 – 2237 . e1 – e16 , May 11 , 2023 e16 Article Supplemental ﬁgures A Retriever Retromer VPS35L VPS29 VPS26C VPS35 VPS29 VPS26A Ladde r T B C 1 D 5 T B C 1 D 5 + R e t r o m e r T B C 1 D 5 + R e t r i e v e r T B C 1 D 5 T B C 1 D 5 + R e t r o m e r T B C 1 D 5 + R e t r i e v e r Input Strep - tactin bound VPS35 → his - TBC1D5 → VPS35L→ VPS29 - his → Strep - VPS26A→ Strep - VPS26C → C oo m a ss i e W e s t e r n TBC1D5 2 % G F P i npu t G F P G F P - T B C 1 D 5 GFPtrap CCDC93 CCDC22 VPS26C VPS29 GFP COMMD1 VPS35 VPS26A VPS35L - 75 - 75 - 75 - 37 - 100 - 25 - 37 - 15 - 15 - 25 kDa VPS26A VPS29 CCDC93 CCDC22 COMMD1 ANKRD27 TBC1D5 2 % G F P i npu t G F P G F P - VPS 35 G F P - VPS 35L GFP - 37 - 15 - 75 - 75 - 15 - 25 - 150 - 100 - 75 - 100 - 100 - 150 GFPtrap kDa m C he rr y 2 % m C he rr y i npu t m C he rr y R I D L 1 - 200 m C he rr y R I D L F L VPS35 VPS26A VPS29 VPS35L CCDC93 CCDC22 COMMD1 mCherry - 75 - 37 - 15 - 100 - 75 - 75 - 15 - 25 - 50 - 150 mCherrytrap kDa B HeLa VPS35 VPS29 Ex2 - C11 VPS29 Ex3 - C5 VPS35LC11 VPS35LC12 R ab7 L A M P 1 CRISPR / Cas9 KO HeLa M e r ge H e l a V PS 35 K O PS 29 K O E x o n 2 C l on e11 VP V S 29 K O E x on 3 C l on e5 VPS 35 L K O C l on e11 VPS 35 L K O C l on e12 - 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 P ea r s on ' sc o e ff i c i e n t ns ns * * * * * * * * * * * * L27 VPS35LTBC1D5ANKRD27RiDLVPS29 P34 L35 V174 L154 L142 P141 L136 L714 P713 I170 P171 180 o 180 o C F H E D G ( legend on next page ) ll OPEN ACCESS Article Figure S1 .

Each COMMD forms a strongly supported ( > 90 % bootstrap ) clan in the unrooted phylogeny , and each clan contains representatives from all major lineages ( supergroups ) of eukaryotes ; this implies that all ten COMMD subunits were already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor ( that is , LECA appears 10 times in the tree ) . Based on the absence of COMMD homologues in Bacteria and Archaea , this protein family likely originated on the eukaryotic stem and proliferated via a series of gene duplications prior to the radiation of the modern eukaryotic groups .
