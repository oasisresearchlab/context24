A candidate host factor which mediates this process is cortactin , a protein associated with the processes of colonization and adhesion of H . pylori in gastric epithelium . Aim To investigate the role of cortactin in VacA - induced apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells . Methods Cortactin expression and shRNA lentiviral constructs were developed and transduced into the human gastric cancer cell line , AGS . VacA protein was puriﬁed from H . pylori cultures , acid - activated , and co - incubated with the transduced cell populations . Apoptosis was detected by ﬂow cytometry , and the levels of the pro - and anti - apoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl - 2 were determined by Western blot . Results Acid - activated puriﬁed VacA induced apoptosis in the parental AGS cells . Increased expression of cortactin ( AGS / cortactin ) led to a greater percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis . In contrast , knockdown of cortactin with shRNA ( AGS / cortactin - shRNA ) decreased the per - centage of apoptotic cells . The protein levels of pro - and anti - apoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl - 2 were increased and decreased in AGS / cortactin cells relative to the parental AGS cells . In the AGS / cortactin - shRNA cells , Bax protein levels were decreased , while Bcl - 2 protein was increased . Conclusions The results indicate that cortactin is involved in the regulation of apoptosis induced by VacA in gastric cells . Keywords Cortactin (cid:2) VacA (cid:2) Helicobacter pylori (cid:2) Bax (cid:2) Bcl - 2 (cid:2) Apoptosis Introduction Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) is a type of Gram - negative bacteria colonizing the human stomach . The bacteria infect approximately 50 % of the human population worldwide , and about 10 – 15 % of people infected develop compli - cating health issues , such as gastritis , gastric ulcer , and gastric cancer [ 1 – 3 ] . Vacuolating cytotoxin antigen ( VacA ) is one of the major virulence factors in H . pylori . As a secreted toxin , it has a variety of biological effects on host cells , such as causing cell vacuolar degeneration , inducing apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells , affecting antigen pre - sentation , and inhibiting T cell proliferation [ 4 – 7 ] . In pre - vious studies , the abnormal cell apoptosis caused by VacA protein has been linked to the occurrence and development of gastric carcinoma [ 8 – 10 ] . Cortactin ( cortical actin - binding protein ) is an activator of actin - related protein complexes ARP2 / 3 , and a ﬁla - mentous actin - binding protein [ 11 , 12 ] . The protein is also Hui Chang and Dongfeng Chen have contributed equally to this work . & Chunhui Lan tiandaochouqin99 @ hotmail . com 1 Department of Gastroenterology , Daping Hospital , Third Military Medical University , 10 Changjiang Branch Road , Chongqing 400042 , China 2 Department of Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmacy , College of Pharmacy , The Third Military Medical University , Chongqing , China 3 Cadre’s Ward of Bethune International Peace Hospital , PLA , Shijiazhuang City , Hebei Province , China 4 Department of Gastroenterology , Guizhou Aerospace Hospital , Zunyi City , Guizhou Province , China 123 Dig Dis Sci ( 2016 ) 61 : 80 – 90 DOI 10 . 1007 / s10620 - 015 - 3836 - 0 an important molecular link between signal transduction pathways and the cytoskeleton , which enables migration [ 13 – 15 ] . Expression of the cortactin gene has been found to be abnormally high in cancer tissue samples [ 16 – 18 ] , and protein function has been associated with cancer cell movement , tumor cell invasion , and metastasis [ 19 ] . Col - onization , adhesion , and intracellular movement of H . pylori involve cortactin [ 20 – 22 ] . Furthermore , cortactin possibly has a more direct role as it is involved in the actual transport of VacA between cytophagosomes [ 22 ] . Bax and Bak are two key cell factors in apoptosis . These proteins form pores in cell membranes allowing for a large inﬂux of cytochrome c into the cytosol , which induces apoptosis [ 23 – 26 ] . Bcl - 2 is an anti - apoptotic molecule , which prevents the release of cytochrome c from mito - chondria into the cytosol , thereby inhibiting apoptosis . The balance between pro - apoptotic and anti - apoptotic mole - cules determines cell survival or death in response to var - ious stimuli [ 23 , 25 ] . Here , the role for cortactin in mediating the apoptotic activity of VacA was investigated in a gastric cancer cell line by using lentiviral constructs that expressed cortactin or shRNA to knock down the protein . Puriﬁed acid - acti - vated VacA protein was used to induce apoptosis which was detected by ﬂow cytometry . Furthermore , to gain understanding the molecules mediating apoptosis in these cells , pro - and anti - apoptotic proteins , Bax and Bcl - 2 , were investigated . The results indicated that cortactin levels inﬂuence VacA - induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells .

Annealing was performed by heating the mixture to 100 (cid:3) C and cooling to room temperature . The annealed fragments were diluted 1 : 100 with sterile water . The vector pLVX - shRNA2 - Puro was digested with Bam HI and Eco RI , and the digested fragments were puriﬁed by agarose gel electrophoresis .

Cells were subsequently , col - lected , centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 rpm , and resuspended in 1 9 binding buffer . Annexin V - FITC ( 5 l L ) and PI ( 5 l L ) were added and incubated with the cells at room temperature for 15 min . The cells were then analyzed on a ﬂow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ; San Jose , CA , USA ) . All experiments were performed in triplicate . Data were ana - lyzed using CellQuest software and are displayed as the mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Protein Lysates and Western Blotting Cells were seeded into two wells of six - well plate and cultured for 24 h . Activated VacA protein was added , and protein lysates were prepared from cells collected at 0 , 6 , 12 , and 24 h . Medium was removed from plates which were turned upside down and dried on absorbent papers . Cells were rinsed three times with 3 mL 0 . 01 M PBS ( pH 7 . 2 – 7 . 3 ) at 4 (cid:3) C by gentle shaking for 1 min . Lysis buffer ( 400 l L ) containing 1 mM PMSF was added to the wells , and cells were lysed for 30 min on ice . Cells were scraped from the wells and transferred to a 1 . 5 - mL centrifuge tube . Lysates were centrifuged at 12 , 000 9 g for 15 min at 4 (cid:3) C to pellet cell debris , and the supernatants were collected and stored at - 20 (cid:3) C . VacA protein or protein lysates were separated by 8 % SDS - PAGE . Gels were electro - blotted onto PVDF mem - brane , and blots for protein lysates were ﬁrst blocked with 3 % BSA for 1 h .

After cation exchange chro - matography , a band corresponding to VacA protein was observed migrating at 95 kDa , but a number of contami - nating proteins were also present ( Fig . 1a ) . The putative VacA protein was further enriched by hydrophobic inter - action chromatography ( Fig . 1b ) . A ﬁnal puriﬁcation was performed over anion exchange chromatography and resulted in a purity of VacA of about 90 % . The protein concentration was 0 . 11 mg / mL ( Fig . 1b ) . To conﬁrm that the band at 95 kDa was VacA and its level of purity , the protein eluates after each chromatography step were ana - lyzed by Western blot ( Fig . 2 ) . The results demonstrated that the band running at 95 kDa was puriﬁed VacA . To determine whether the puriﬁed protein was active , AGS cells were co - incubated with activated VacA protein at different concentrations ( 0 , 5 , and 10 ng / mL ) , and the cavitation effect of VacA on the AGS cells was investi - gated . Morphological changes were observed in the treated cells relative to the control ( Fig . 3 ) , and the number / size of vacuoles was signiﬁcantly increased with increasing VacA concentration . The induction of apoptosis was also inves - tigated to determine whether the puriﬁed activated VacA protein was functional . AGS cells were co - incubated with 0 , 5 , and 10 ng / mL acid - activated VacA for 24 h , and the percentages of apoptotic AGS cells were determined by ﬂow cytometry . An increase in the percentages of apoptotic cells was observed at 5 ( 12 ± 0 . 2 % ) and 10 ng / mL ( 12 . 6 ± 1 . 0 % ) of protein relative to the control ( 0 ng / mL ; 7 . 3 ± 0 . 3 % ; Fig . 4A ) . These differences in the percent - ages of AGS cells undergoing apoptosis between the con - trol group and the VacA - treated groups were statistically signiﬁcant ( p \ 0 . 01 ; Fig . 4B ) . Development of Cortactin and shRNA - Expressing AGS Cell Lines The cortactin expression plasmid pLVX - cortactin - mCMV - ZsGreen - PGK - Puro and the cortactin - shRNA interference plasmid pLVX - shRNA2 - Puro - cortactin were generated Fig . 5 Transfection of pLVX - cortactin - mCMV - ZsGreen - PGK - Puro and pLVX - shRNA2 - Puro - cortactin into 293T cells is highly efﬁcient . 293T cells transfected with expression constructs for cortactin ( pLVX - cortactin - mCMV - ZsGreen - PGK - Puro ) and cortactin - shRNA ( pLVX - shRNA2 - Puro - cortactin ) were imaged after 24 h under ﬂuo - rescence in a and c , respectively , and bright ﬁeld in b and d , respectively , in order to determine efﬁciency of transfection based on expression of green ﬂuorescent protein . Scale bar 100 l m 84 Dig Dis Sci ( 2016 ) 61 : 80 – 90 123 and conﬁrmed by restriction analysis and sequencing . The plasmids were transfected into 293T cells , and within 24 h , green ﬂuorescence was detected , indicating that both con - structs were expressed in 293T cells ( Fig . 5a , c ) . Com - parison to bright ﬁeld demonstrated that the transfections reached an efﬁciency of * 50 % ( Fig . 5b , d ) . The con - structs were subsequently packaged , the titer of the len - tivirus rLv - cortactin and rLv - shRNA - cortactin was determined ( 5 9 10 7 and 1 9 10 8 TU / mL , respectively ) , and the viability of these lentiviruses was veriﬁed through infection of 293T cells . Finally , rLv - cortactin and rLv - shRNA - cortactin were transduced into the human gastric carcinoma AGS cells . Selection was performed on the transfected AGS cell lines in puromycin , and the stable integration of the lentiviral constructs in AGS cell lines was veriﬁed under ﬂuorescence and bright - ﬁeld micro - scopy ( Fig . 6 ) . Quantity real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) to measure the level of cortactin before and after treatment with the plasmids of cortactin and shRNA . The results demonstrated that the expression level of cortactin in Lv - cortactin - AGS cells was signiﬁcantly higher than in AGS cells , and the expression level of cor - tactin in Lv - shRNA - cortactin - AGS cells was signiﬁcantly lower than in AGS cells . These results indicated that the transfection was effective ( Fig . 7 ) . Cortactin Mediates VacA Protein - Induced Apoptosis To determine the role of cortactin in mediating cell response to VacA , the parental AGS , AGS / cortactin , and AGS / cortactin - shRNA cells were treated with acid - acti - vated VacA protein at 0 , 5 , and 10 ng / mL for 0 , 6 , 12 , and 24 h , and ﬂow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis . Importantly , increased expression of cortactin or cortactin - shRNA did not induce apoptosis of AGS cells as demon - strated by the 0 - h time point ( Figs . 8a , 9 ) . However , the decrease in the percentage of AGS / cortactin - shRNA cells undergoing apoptosis reached statistical signiﬁcance ( p = 0 . 003 ) . At all other time points ( 6 , 12 , and 24 h ) , apoptosis was signiﬁcantly increased in treated AGS / cor - tactin cells over the parental cells ( Figs . 8a , b ; 9 ) . In con - trast , the percentage of AGS / cortactin - shRNA cells Fig . 6 AGS cells transduced with expression constructs for cortactin protein and shRNA and selected in puromycin express green ﬂuorescent protein . AGS cells were transduced with the lentiviral construct containing the cortactin coding sequence and green ﬂuorescent protein . Images were taken 48 h after selection in puromycin . Transduction results are shown for pLVX - cortactin - mCMV - ZsGreen - PGK - Puro under a ﬂuorescence and b bright - ﬁeld microscopy ; and pLVX - shRNA2 - Puro - cortactin under c ﬂuorescence and d bright - ﬁeld microscopy . Scale bar 100 l m Dig Dis Sci ( 2016 ) 61 : 80 – 90 85 123 undergoing apoptosis remained stable over time in response to puriﬁed activated VacA protein ( Fig . 8b – d ) . These results demonstrated that increased cortactin protein caused cells to be more sensitive to apoptosis induced by puriﬁed activated VacA protein . Cortactin Mediated the Function of Activated VacA on the Expression of Cell Apoptosis - Related Genes To determine whether cortactin modulated proteins involved in eliciting the apoptotic response , Bax and Bcl - 2 levels in the different cell populations under treatment were assessed by Western blot . At all time points , the levels of Bax , a protein which promotes apoptosis , were increased in AGS / cortactin cells relative to the parental cell line . Cor - respondingly , cortactin - shRNA appeared to interfere with molecular response to apoptosis as Bax was decreased in AGS / cortactin - shRNA cells relative to the parental AGS cells ( Fig . 10b ) . In contrast , the absence of cortactin led to increased Bcl - 2 , a protein which interferes with apoptosis . At all time points , Bcl - 2 levels were increased in treated AGS / cortactin - shRNA cells , but decreased in AGS / cor - tactin cells relative to the control ( Fig . 10a ) . These results indicated that cortactin modulated Bax and Bcl - 2 protein levels in response to activated VacA protein . Discussion H . pylori closely interacts with cortactin during the pro - cesses of colonization , adhesion , and intracellular move - ment of the pathogen , leading to the dephosphorylation of cortactin , the redistribution of actin , and toxin protein invasion [ 21 , 22 ] . Cortactin has also been implicated in the trafﬁcking of VacA , one of the major virulence factors from H . pylori , between cytophagosomes [ 22 ] . Thus , cor - tactin may be an important cellular molecule facilitating toxic events as a result of cell contact with activated VacA . Here , a regulatory role for cortactin in apoptosis induced by VacA was investigated . The results demonstrated that in VacA - treated AGS / cortactin cells , both the percentage of apoptotic cells and the expression of the pro - apoptotic protein Bax were signiﬁcantly increased , while the expression of the anti - apoptotic protein Bcl - 2 was decreased . In contrast , cortactin - shRNA interfered with apoptosis in VacA - treated cells , and cells exhibited a cor - responding decrease in Bax and increase in Bcl - 2 . Cortactin is a central regulator of the host actin cytoskeleton , and many pathogens highjack signals that con - verge on this scaffolding protein . For example , the pathogen H . pylori induces inactivation and dephosphorylation of the SH3 domain in cortactin [ 21 ] . Although in recent years the number of studies focused on cortactin has increased sharply because ofits important role inthe colonization , adhesion , and intracellular movement of H . pylori , what the protein does during these processes has not yet been clearly deﬁned . Two possible roles for cortactin are in the transport of VacA between cytophagosomes [ 22 ] , and thus perhaps , in VacA - induced apoptosis when transported into mitochondria asso - ciated with dynamic F - actin structures [ 24 ] . Based on these observations , the relationship between cortactin and VacA protein was further investigated in order to assess the overall signiﬁcance of cortactin on pathogenicity of H . pylori . Cor - tactin levels were also found to inﬂuence levels of apoptosis - related proteins , such as the pro - apoptotic protein Bax and the anti - apoptotic protein Bcl - 2 . These results indicated that cortactin may mediate apoptosis triggered by acid - activated VacA . Cortactin thus appears to work as an important target protein for the pathogen H . pylori . However , there are potential limitations to this study . First , only a single cell line , AGS , was used to perform experiments in vitro . Animal models , including transgenic mice , as well as additional cell lines will help to better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying VacA induction of apoptosis . Second , the experiments here did not deﬁne the mechanism , for example transcription , for the regulation of Bax and Bcl - 2 by cortactin . Finally , there is a lack of corresponding experiments and data illumi - nating the possible relationship between Bax , Bcl - 2 , and Fig . 7 Cortactin levels in AGS cells are increased and decreased by expression constructs for cortactin and the shRNA , respectively . qRT - PCR was used to evaluate expression levels of cortactin in the AGS parental cells and AGS cells transduced with expression constructs for cortactin ( Lv - cortactin - AGS cells ) and shRNA ( Lv - shRNA - cortactin - AGS cells ) . GAPDH was used for normalization 86 Dig Dis Sci ( 2016 ) 61 : 80 – 90 123 VacA - induced gastric epithelial cell apoptosis . However , this study demonstrated that cortactin might mediate apoptosis induced by the H . pylori VacA protein in gastric epithelial cells through the regulation of Bax and Bcl - 2 . Results from this study thus provide a framework to further analyze mechanisms underlying VacA function mediated by cortactin and the proteins potentially downstream dur - ing H . pylori infection . Fig . 8 Percentage of apoptotic cells increases with increased cor - tactin . Cells were co - incubated with activated VacA for a 0 , b 6 , c 12 , and d 12 h and collected for PE - A – annexin V and propidium iodide analysis to detect apoptosis . Cells analyzed are as follows : column 1 , AGS / cortactin - shRNA ; column 2 , parental AGS ; and column 3 , AGS / cortactin Dig Dis Sci ( 2016 ) 61 : 80 – 90 87 123 In summary , we propose that high protein levels of cortactin promote the apoptotic function of acid - activated VacA in gastric epithelial cells . Further downstream , the pro - apoptotic protein Bax is induced , while the anti - apoptotic protein Bcl - 2 is inhibited which ultimately results in the apoptosis of target cells . These results establish a working model for the study of H . pylori infection in target cell types . Fig . 9 Apoptosis is reduced in AGS / shRNA - cortactin cells treated with activated VacA .
