Using a recently developed algorithm for generic rigidity of two - dimensional graphs , we analyze rigidity and connectivity percolation transitions in two dimensions on lattices of linear size up to L = 4096 . We compare three diﬀerent universal - ity classes : The generic rigidity class ; the connectivity class and ; the generic “braced square net” ( GBSN ) . We analyze the spanning cluster density P ∞ , the backbone density P B and the density of dangling ends P D . In the generic rigidity and con - nectivity cases , the load - carrying component of the spanning cluster , the backbone , is fractal at p c , so that the backbone density behaves as B ∼ ( p − p c ) β ′ for p > p c . We estimate β ′ gr = 0 . 25 ± 0 . 02 for generic rigidity and β ′ c = 0 . 467 ± 0 . 007 for the connectivity case . We ﬁnd the correlation length ex - ponents , ν gr = 1 . 16 ± 0 . 03 for generic rigidity compared to the exact value for connectivity ν c = 4 / 3 . In contrast the GBSN undergoes a ﬁrst - order rigidity transition , with the backbone density being extensive at p c , and undergoing a jump discon - tinuity on reducing p across the transition . We deﬁne a model which tunes continuously between the GBSN and GR classes and show that the GR class is typical . I . INTRODUCTION Scalar Percolation is a simple model for disordered sys - tems , and has received much attention in the last two decades [ 1 – 3 ] . This model describes the transmission of a scalar conserved quantity ( for example electric charge , or ﬂuid mass ) across a randomly diluted system . How - ever in the calculation of mechanical properties force ( i . e . a vector ) must be transmitted across the system [ 4 ] . It was originally suggested [ 6 ] that the critical behavior of the elastic moduli of a percolating system should be equivalent to that of its conductivity , but this is only valid for the scalar limit of the Born model of elastic - ity [ 5 ] , a model which is not rotationally invariant and in many cases inappropriate . Elastic percolation is not in general equivalent to scalar percolation . This was ﬁrst made clear by the work of Feng and Sen [ 7 ] , which showed that central - force elasticity percolation was in a diﬀerent universality class than scalar percolation , and provided the starting point for a renewed interest in this problem . It soon became clear that the elasticity problem can be divided in two categories [ 13 ] , according to the kind of forces which hold the lattice together . If angular forces are important [ 8 – 12 , 15 ] , a singly - connected path across the lattice is enough to ensure rigidity , so any conﬁg - uration of bonds which is connected is also rigid . In this case , the geometry of the elastic backbone is ex - actly the same as that of the scalar percolation prob - lem [ 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 ] . This is the case for bond - bending [ 8 , 9 ] and beam [ 10 , 15 ] models . Thus , the elasticity percola - tion problem with angular forces is now well understood and that understanding has borrowed much from the ge - ometrically equivalent scalar percolation problem . It is the purpose of this paper to analyze the more challeng - ing central - force rigidity percolation transition , stressing the similarities and diﬀerences between this problem and scalar percolation . a b c d e f FIG . 1 . The six bodies shown in this ﬁgure are rigidly connected , i . e . they belong to the same rigid cluster . But the removal of any bond ( thin black lines ) leads to the collapse of the structure , which is then reduced to a collection of six in - dependent rigid clusters ( no two are rigidly connected ) . This means that the existence of a rigid connection between for ex - ample clusters e and f cannot be decided on local information only , since it depends on the presence of ’far away’ bonds , i . e . bonds not connected to clusters e or f . If rigidity [ 7 , 14 , 18 , 20 – 23 , 25 , 24 , 32 , 35 ] is provided by central forces alone ( e . g . rotatable springs ) , single - connectedness is not enough to ensure rigidity . In this case a lattice that is conducting usually would not sup - port an applied stress ( i . e . it would not be rigid ) . This was ﬁrst shown by Feng and Sen [ 7 ] who found that the rigidity threshold is signiﬁcantly larger than the conduc - tivity threshold . An exception worth mentioning is the case of elastic lattices under tension , or equivalently , sys - tems in which all springs have zero repose length [ 16 ] . For such systems , conductivity and Young modulus are equivalent , i . e . rigidity appears at the scalar percolation point . It has been recently emphasized [ 17 ] that entropic eﬀects can give rise to similar eﬀects in central - force sys - tems with nonzero repose length and ﬁnite temperature , although the connection with ref . [ 16 ] was not established . The main diﬃculties associated with central - force elas - ticity are as follows : Whereas in the scalar connectivity case it is a trivial problem to determine when two sites be - long to the same connected cluster , in the case of central - force rigidity it is not in general easy to decide whether two objects are rigidly connected . For example it takes some thinking to see that the six bodies in Fig . 1 form a rigid unit . Thus it is not easy to see how a computer algorithm can be devised to identify rigid clusters . In the scalar connectivity problem , the removal of a 1 singly - connected bond leads to the separation of a con - nected cluster into two clusters . In the rigidity case , the removal of an analogous “cutting bond” may produce the collapse of a rigid cluster to a collection of an arbitrarily large number of smaller ones ( we call this the house - of - cards mechanism ) . Fig . 1 shows a simple example of this situation . Due to this fact , the transmission of rigidity can be “non - local” [ 14 , 32 ] , since a bond added between two clusters on one side of the sample may induce rigidity between two clusters on the other side of a sample . a ) b ) FIG . 2 . Three bars are in general enough to form a rigid connection between two rigid bodies ( case a ) , but for partic - ular , degenerate cases ( case b ) , rigidity fails even when the system has the right number of bars . Case b fails to be rigid because the three bars happen to have a common point . A structure formed by two bodies connected by three bars is generically rigid in two dimensions if it is rigid “for most ge - ometrical arrangements” , i . e . leaving aside degenerate conﬁg - urations such as b ) , which occur with probability zero in the conﬁguration space . A second source of diﬃculties in the problem of central - force rigidity is the existence of particular geometrical arrangements for which a system may fail to be rigid [ 39 ] even if it is rigid for most other cases [ 28 , 27 , 30 , 32 ] . Take for example two rigid bodies connected by three bars in two dimensions , as shown in Fig . 2 . This structure is in general rigid , but if the three bars happen to have a common point , then the structure is not rigid , since this common point is the center of relative rotations [ 32 ] between the two bodies . Particular geometrical arrangements ( such as Fig . 2b ) , which are non - rigid even when the structure is rigid for most other conﬁgurations , are called degenerate conﬁg - urations . Degenerate conﬁgurations appear with proba - bility zero if the lattice locations are “randomly chosen” . A lattice is thus said to be generically rigid , if it is rigid for most geometrical arrangements of its sites . Generic rigidity only depends on the topology of the underlying graph , i . e . ignores the possibility of degeneracies . Since degenerate conﬁgurations are always possible on perfectly regular lattices , we will assume our lattice sites to have small random displacements , in which case generic rigid - ity applies . Up to recently , no simple algorithms existed for the determination of the rigid - cluster structure of arbitrary lattices . Due to this , direct solving of the elastic equa - tions was one of the few methods [ 4 ] available to obtain information on the structure of rigidly connected clus - ters . But this is very time - consuming and did not allow the study of large lattices . Previous simulations were for example not suﬃciently precise to conﬁrm or reject the proposal [ 18 – 20 ] that bond - bending and central - force elastic percolation might after all still be in the same uni - versality class . This suggestion was not inconsistent with some numerical results obtained on small - sized systems [ 18 – 22 ] . Recently there has been a breakthrough in the sys - tem sizes accessible to numerical analysis [ 23 – 25 ] , fol - lowing the development of eﬃcient graph - theoretic meth - ods for the problem or generic rigidity in two dimensions [ 27 , 30 , 31 ] . Using such methods , we study the central - force rigidity percolation problem on randomly diluted triangular lattices of linear size up to L = 3200 , and con - nectivity percolation and body - joint rigidity percolation on site - diluted square lattices of size up to L = 4096 . Our numerical algorithm [ 30 ] is complementary to the “pebble game” [ 24 , 31 ] , which is an implementation of Hendrick - son’s matching algorithm in the original “joint - bar” rep - resentation of the network [ 27 ] ( see below ) . This paper is an elaboration and extension of our two recent letters on this subject [ 23 , 25 ] . We extend and elaborate upon the numerical data presented there in several ways : by com - paring rigidity and connectivity percolation , by studying signiﬁcantly larger lattices for rigidity percolation , by giv - ing data on site and bond diluted lattices with a variety of boundary conditions ; by presenting results on a new body - joint model which is in the universality class of bar - and - joint rigidity percolation and ; by presenting detailed results for a model which continuously tunes between the braced square lattice ( which has a ﬁrst order rigidity tran - sition ) and the isotropic triangular lattice ( which has a second order rigidity transition ) . The numerical method is brieﬂy described in Section II . In Section III , our results are presented and their implica - tions discussed . A comparison is made with other avail - able numerical and analytical results for the central - force rigidity percolation problem . We also discuss the issue of ﬁrst - order rigidity , which has been the subject of a com - ment and reply in physical review letters [ 26 ] . Section IV contains our conclusions . II . THE NUMERICAL METHOD We take an initially depleted triangular lattice and add bonds ( in the bond - diluted case ) or sites ( in the site - diluted case ) to it one at a time , and use a graph - theoretic matching algorithm [ 30 ] in order to identify the rigid clus - ters that are formed in the system . For the case of bond dilution , p is the density of present bonds , while in site dilution it indicates the density of present sites . In the site - diluted problem , a bond is present if the two sites it connects are . We use the body - bar version [ 30 ] of a recently proposed rigidity algorithm [ 27 ] . This algorithm , being combina - torial in nature , allows us to identify sets of sites which are rigidly connected , without providing any information on the actual values of the stresses when an external load is applied . The body - bar algorithm sees the lattice as a collection of rigid clusters ( or “bodies” ) connected by bars , instead of points connected by bars as proposed in the original algorithm [ 27 ] and as implemented in the “pebble game” [ 31 ] . The body - bar representation allows a more eﬃcient use of CPU and memory , as each rigid cluster is represented as one object . The matching iden - tiﬁes rigid clusters and condenses them to one node as new bonds are added to the network . In two - dimensional rigidity , a rigid cluster has 3 degrees 2 of freedom , while a point - like joint has 2 . Therefore the minimum number of bonds needed to rigidize n joints in 2d is ( 2 n − 3 ) . Matching algorithms [ 27 , 30 , 31 ] are based on this sort of constraint - counting . FIG . 3 . Inﬁnite percolation clusters which lie in diﬀerent universality classes : a ) Connectivity percolation ( g = G = 1 ) on a triangular lattice ; b ) Rigidity percolation ( g = 2 , G = 3 ) on a triangular lattice ; c ) Rigidity percolation ( g = 2 , G = 3 ) on a braced square lattice . For a ) and b ) , boundary conditions are periodic in the horizontal direction while for c ) they are free . The system size L = 64 and rigid bus - bars are set on the upper and lower ends of the sample . The backbone , is composed of ’blobs’ of internally stressed bonds ( thick black lines ) , rigidly interconnected by cutting bonds ( gray lines ) . Cutting bonds are also called red bonds . Removing one of them produces the collapse of the system . Dangling ends ( thin lines ) are rigidly connected to the backbone , but do not add to the ability of these networks to carry a DC external load ( or current ) . The body - bar algorithm [ 30 ] , can be extended to han - dle “rigidity problems” with arbitrary values of g ( num - ber of degrees of freedom of a joint ) and G ( degrees of freedom of a rigid cluster ) . Connectivity for example , is just a special ( simple ) case of rigidity with g = 1 and G = 1 : the minimum number of bonds needed to connect n points is n − 1 in any dimension . Connectivity perco - lation can thus be studied using this algorithm . More details on the application of matching algorithms for the speciﬁc case of connectivity percolation can be found in Ref . [ 43 ] . There are several ways to deﬁne the onset of global rigidity in a network [ 23 ] . We have used two distinct methods . First we determine whether an externally ap - plied stress can be supported by the network , which we call applied stress ( AS ) percolation . Secondly we studied the percolation of internally - stressed ( IS ) regions . At the AS percolation point , an applied stress is ﬁrst able to be transmitted between the lower and upper sides of the sample . As we add bonds one at a time , we are able to exactly detect this percolation point by perform - ing a simple test [ 30 ] which consists in connecting an additional ﬁctitious spring between the upper and lower sides of the system . This auxiliary spring mimics the ef - fect of an external load , and therefore the ﬁrst time that a macroscopic rigid connection exists , a globally stressed region ( the backbone ) appears . The IS critical point is deﬁned as the bond - or site density at which internal stresses percolate through the system . This means that the upper and lower sides of the system belong to the same self - stressed cluster [ 23 ] , and this is trivially detected within the matching algo - rithm [ 30 ] . The AS and IS deﬁnitions of percolation are in principle diﬀerent , but we found [ 23 ] that the average percolation threshold and the critical indices coincide for large lattices . Similar deﬁnitions apply to the connectiv - ity case , with the AS case being the usual deﬁnition , i . e . the onset of electric conductivity , and IS being percola - tion of “Eddy currents” . We deﬁne the spanning cluster ( Fig . 3 ) as the set of bonds that are rigidly connected to both sides of the sample . However only a subset of these bonds carry the applied load . This subset is called the backbone . The backbone will in general include some cutting bonds , so named because the removal of any one of them leads to the loss of global load carrying capability . Cutting bonds attain their maximum number exactly at p c [ 38 ] . The backbone bonds which are not cutting bonds are parts of internally overconstrained blobs . In the rigidity case , the smallest overconstrained cluster on a triangular lattice is the complete hexagonal wheel ( twelve bonds ) , while in the connectivity case it is a triangle ( i . e . the smallest possible loop ) . The spanning cluster also contains bonds which are rigidly connected to both ends of the sample but which do not carry any of the applied load . These are called dangling ends . This classiﬁcation is standard in connectivity ( scalar ) percolation [ 37 ] . In this work we analyze several other boundary condi - tions , particularly in the generic rigidity case on triangu - lar lattice . In that case , for site dilution we analyze : AS with rigid bus - bars at the ends of the sample , AS with - out bus bars ( any - pair rigidity ) , and IS with bus - bars . For bond dilution , only the AS with bus - bars case was studied . We determine the exact percolation point ( AS or IS ) for each sample , so we can identify and measure the diﬀerent components of the spanning cluster exactly at p c for each sample . This should be contrasted with 3 usual numerical approaches , in which averages are done at ﬁxed values of p , and < p c > is obtained from ﬁnite - size scaling ( e . g . data collapse ) . In that case , it is known that slight diﬀerences in the estimation of < p c > can lead to important deviations in critical indices [ 18 ] . This source of error is absent in our measurements . Sample averages are done over approximately 10 8 / L 2 samples . III . RESULTS We ﬁrst analyze the size dependence of the three key probabilities P B , the backbone density , P D , the dangling end density and P ∞ , the inﬁnite cluster density , exactly at their percolation thresholds as described in the previous section . In Fig . 4a - c , this data is presented for the three diﬀerent universality classes in Figs . 3a - c . 10 100 1000 L(cid:12) 0 . 01 0 . 10 1 . 00 0 . 10 1 . 00 10 100 1000 a b c d FIG . 4 . Density of backbone bonds ( circles ) , dan - gling bonds ( squares ) and inﬁnite cluster bonds ( diamonds ) at the AS critical point for : a ) Connectivity percolation ( g = G = 1 ) on a site - diluted square lattice ; b ) Rigidity percolation ( g = 2 , G = 3 ) on a site - diluted triangular lattice ; c ) Rigidity on a randomly braced square lattice ; d ) Body rigidity ( G = g = 3 ) on a site - diluted square lattice . Case c corresponds to the generic braced square net ( GBSN ) , which is a square lattice to which diagonals are added at random with probability p . The non - generic version of this problem has been studied by many au - thors [ 33 – 35 ] , and it is well known that the number of di - agonals needed to rigidize it is not extensive : p c ∼ 0 when L → ∞ . This is conﬁrmed by our numerical simulations , which correspond to the bus - bar boundary condition . In Fig . 4d we also present data for the rigidity case g = 3 , G = 3 on a square lattice , to further test whether the rigidity class is universal in two dimensions . In this model each site of a square lattice is a body and so has g = 3 degrees of freedom . Each of these bodies is con - nected to each adjacent body by two bonds or bars , i . e . two contiguous bodies are pinned at a common point . Maxwell counting [ 46 ] then implies f = 3 − 4 p , so that the Maxwell estimate of the bond percolation threshold is 3 / 4 . Our numerical estimate is p c = 0 . 74877 ± 0 . 00005 , thus conﬁrming the accuracy of the Maxwell approxima - tion . One clear feature of Fig . 4 is that the BSN ( Fig . 4c ) has a qualitatively diﬀerent behavior than the other cases . For the BSN , P B , P ∞ and P D all have a ﬁnite density at large L , indicating that the rigidity transition is ﬁrst order in this case . In contrast , in both the connectiv - ity ( Fig . 4a ) and rigidity cases ( Figs . 4b , d ) , P B and P ∞ are decreasing in a power law fashion over the available size ranges . However the behavior of P D is more complex . First we discuss the behavior of P B . At a second order phase transition , ﬁnite - size scal - ing theory predicts P B ( p c ) ∼ L − β ′ / ν . Taking into ac - count correction - to - scaling terms , which we assume to be power - law , we may generally write P B = C 1 L − e ( 1 + C 2 L − ω ) . ( 1 ) This expression is ﬁtted to our numerical data by choosing the set of parameters { C 1 , C 2 , e , ω } that min - imize the error E = X P measuredB − P fitB P measuredB ! 2 . ( 2 ) A plot of − log ( P B ) / log ( L ) vs . 1 / log ( L ) should then have an asymptotic ( L → ∞ ) intercept equal to the lead - ing exponent e . Similar ﬁtting procedures were used to produce Figures 5 and 8 , where the leading exponent is β / ν and 1 / ν respectively . A ﬁt of the data in Fig . 4b , d produces a rather universal estimate β ′ gr / ν = 0 . 22 ± 0 . 02 . In consequence the rigid backbone is fractal at p c , with a fractal dimension D B = 1 . 78 ± 0 . 02 . In the connectivity case ( Fig . 4a ) , we ﬁnd [ 43 ] β ′ / ν = 0 . 350 ± 0 . 005 , or D B = 1 . 650 ± 0 . 005 , which is consistent with the most precise prior work [ 44 , 45 ] . Now we consider P ∞ and P D . In the connectivity case ( Fig . 4a ) , an analysis of the dangling ends and inﬁnite cluster probabilities ( Fig . 5a ) both lead to the estimate β / ν = 0 . 10 − 0 . 11 , in agreement with the exact result 5 / 48 . In the rigidity case however , there are strong ﬁnite size eﬀects and even at sizes of L = 3200 ( joint - bar rigid - ity , Fig 4b ) , and L = 4096 ( body - joint rigidity , Fig . 4d , it looks as though the dangling probability may be satu - rating , while the inﬁnite cluster density continues to de - crease . Since P ∞ = P B + P D , it is expected that asymp - totically P ∞ and P D must behave in the same manner . Clearly the numerical results for the range of system sizes currently available are still controlled by ﬁnite size eﬀects , and the results depend on the analysis method chosen . Jacobs and Thorpe [ 24 ] chose to interpret the inﬁnite cluster probability as being key . A ﬁt to the P ∞ data of Fig . 4b , d yields β / ν = 0 . 147 ± 0 . 005 ( See Fig . 5b , c ) in agreement with Jacobs and Thorpe . But a similar ﬁt of the dangling end density gives β / ν ∼ 0 . 03 for the joint - bar rigidity case ( Fig . 5b ) and β ∼ 0 . 01 for the body - joint rigidity case ( Fig . 5c ) . In our previous work [ 25 ] we were guided by the Cayley tree results [ 36 ] which indicated a ﬁrst order jump in the inﬁnite cluster probability . We thus chose to interpret Fig . 4b , d as indicating a satu - ration of the inﬁnite cluster probability at the dangling end value of about 0 . 1 . Having extended our data from L = 1024 to L = 4096 , it now looks more likely that a small value of β occurs in the rigidity case ( Fig . 5b , c ) , though much larger simulation sizes are required to ﬁnd β / ν precisely . Due to the slow ﬁnite size eﬀects found in the analysis of the inﬁnite cluster and dangling end probabilities , it is natural to be concerned about the eﬀect of boundary 4 conditions and other , usually non - universal , parameters on the observed results . For generic joint - bar rigidity case on triangular lattices we thus tested a variety of diﬀer - ent boundary conditions for both site and bond dilution . This data is presented in Fig . 6 , from which it is seen that the conclusions drawn from the case of rigidity per - colation with applied bus bars are quite robust . 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 / log ( L ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 β / ν 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 / log ( L ) 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 β / ν 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 / log ( L ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 β / ν FIG . 5 . The spanning cluster density exponent β / ν as numerically estimated for a ) connectivity percolation on a square lattice ( L max = 4096 ) , b ) rigidity percolation on a triangular lattice ( L max = 3200 ) and c ) body rigidity on a square lattice ( L max = 4096 ) . Two estimates result in each case from ﬁtting the scaling of spanning cluster density ( tri - angles ) and dangling end density ( circles ) . Solid lines are ﬁts using Eq . ( 1 ) Finally , the behavior of the dangling end density as a function of p is also quite striking . This data is presented in Fig . 7 . At very high p , nearly all bonds belong to the backbone , so the dangling end density approaches zero . Below p c , there is no inﬁnite cluster , so there are again no dangling ends . There then must be a maximum in the density of dangling ends between p c and p = 1 . As seen in Fig . 7 , the interesting feature is the abrupt drop in the dangling density at p c , a feature that appears to become more pronounced with increasing sample size . It is tempting to interpret this as deﬁnitive evidence of a ﬁrst order rigidity transition , but it is also consistent with the strong ﬁnite size eﬀects seen in Figs . 4b , d and Fig . 6 , so we must await large lattice simulations for a deﬁnitive analysis . 10 100 1000 L 0 . 01 0 . 10 1 . 00 FIG . 6 .

Data shown here are for the AS case with bus - bars . Now we turn to the calculation of the correlation length exponent for rigidity percolation . When there is a second - order rigidity transition , there is a di - verging correlation length ξ ∼ | p − p c | − ν . We can ﬁnd the exponent ν of this divergence by measuring 5 the sample - to - sample ﬂuctuations in p c as a function of L .

Two independent estimates result in each case from ﬁtting the scaling of red bonds ( triangles ) and ﬂuctuations in p c ( circles ) . An asymptotic analysis for σ ( L ) is shown in Fig . 8a for connectivity percolation , in 8b for joint - bar rigidity and in 8c for body - joint rigidity . From these ﬁgures we esti - mate 1 / ν = 0 . 75 ± 0 . 01 ( the exact value is 1 / ν = 3 / 4 ) for connectivity percolation and 1 / ν = 0 . 85 ± 0 . 02 for rigidity percolation . This provides further strong evidence that rigidity percolation is second order in two dimensions , though not in the same universality class as scalar perco - lation . In the case of the ﬁrst order rigidity on the braced square net ( Fig . 9c ) , the variations in p c behave as L − 3 / 2 , in accordance with analytical results for this model [ 40 ] . 10 100 1000 L 0 . 10 1 . 00 10 100 1000 L 0 . 0001 0 . 0010 0 . 0100 0 . 1000 1 . 0000 10 100 1000 L 0 . 0001 0 . 0010 0 . 0100 0 . 1000 1 . 0000 FIG . 9 .

Our algorithm also identiﬁes the cutting ( also called red or critical ) bonds at the percolation point , for the case of AS percolation . The number N R of red bonds scales at p c as L x . Coniglio [ 38 ] has shown that x = 1 / ν exactly , for scalar percolation . Numerical evidence suggesting that x = 1 / ν also in rigidity percolation was ﬁrst presented in [ 23 ] . It is in fact possible to extend Coniglio’s reasoning to the case of central - force rigidity percolation [ 40 ] . It turns out that x = 1 / ν has to be rigorously satisﬁed also in this case , and therefore σ ( L ) and 1 / N R ( L ) must have the same slope in a log - log plot . Analysis of the number of cutting bonds is also presented in Fig . 8 , and yields values of 1 / ν consistent with the analysis of variations in percolation thresholds described 6 in the previous paragraph . Since the Cayley tree model [ 36 ] gives behavior quite similar to the braced square net [ 35 ] , i . e . a ﬁrst - order rigidity transition , it is interesting to ask whether the rigidity transition is “usually” like that on the braced square net ( i . e . ﬁrst order ) , or whether the second order transition found on triangular lattices is more typical . In order to probe this issue , we analyze a model which inter - polates between the braced square net and the triangular lattice . In the braced square net , the random diagonals are present with probability p d , to make the lattice rigid it is suﬃcient ( though not necessary ) to add one diagonal to every row of the square lattice . The probability that a spanning cluster exists is then P + = ( 1 − ( 1 − p d ) L ) L , from which we ﬁnd p d ∗ ∼ lnL / L . We generalize this model by randomly adding the di - agonals ( with probability p d ) to a square lattice whose bonds have been diluted with probability q . The braced square net is q = 0 , while if q = 1 − p d this model is equivalent to the bond - diluted triangular lattice . Typi - cal results for various values of q are presented in Fig . 9 . It is seen that even for a small amount of dilution of the square lattice , e . g . q = 0 . 10 , the rigidity transition re - turns to the behavior characteristic of the homogeneously diluted triangular case ( see Fig . 9 ) . We ﬁnd that for suf - ﬁciently large lattice sizes , the universal behavior found in the other rigidity cases holds for any ﬁnite q < 0 . 5 ( for larger values of q it is not possible to rigidize the lattice by randomly adding diagonals ) , and we suggest that the “fully - ﬁrst - order” transition ( i . e . a ﬁrst - order backbone ) only occurs in the special case of a perfect ( undiluted ) square lattice . IV . CONCLUSIONS We have compared three types of percolation transi - tion in two dimensions : the connectivity transition and ; the generic rigidity transition on the triangular lattice and ; the generic rigidity transition on the braced square lattice . A summary of our understanding is as follows : ( i ) The generic rigidity transition on triangular lattices is second order with ν = 1 . 16 ± 0 . 03 , 0 ≤ β ≤ 0 . 2 , β ′ = 0 . 25 ± 0 . 02 and ; ( ii ) The rigidity transition on the braced square net is ﬁrst order with ﬁnite backbone , spanning cluster and cutting bond densities at the per - colation threshold . Only the value of β for the generic rigidity transition on triangular lattices remains contro - versial , due to the very strong ﬁnite size eﬀects in that case . To illustrate the fact that our data is inconsistent with a ﬁrst order backbone in the site - joint rigidity case , we have developed the following scaling argument . Assume that the backbone mass [ 41 ] scales as M B ∼ L D B at p c . If the backbone is compact then D B = d , the dimension of the system . The backbone mass is com - posed of red ( or cutting ) bonds plus “blobs” of over - constrained , or self - stressed bonds ( See Fig . 3 ) . There - fore M B = M red + M blobs . The number of red bonds in the backbone scales as M red ∼ L 1 / ν , as analytical results [ 38 , 40 ] and the simulations reported here show . Let us furthermore write M blobs = n blobs × m blobs where n blobs is the number of blobs in the backbone , and m blobs be the average number of bonds in a blob . Therefore L D B ∼ L 1 / ν + n blobs m blobs . Now , the AS backbone is an exactly isostatic body - bar structure , formed by rigid clus - ters ( blobs ) joined by bars ( red bonds ) so that count - ing of degrees of freedom is exact on it and so M red = 3 n blobs + 2 n s − 3 [ 30 ] . Here n s is the number of sites in the backbone , that do not belong to a blob ( see Fig . 3 ) . This identity is known as Laman’s condition [ 29 , 30 ] , and results from the fact that each red bond acts as a bar and therefore restricts one degree of freedom , while each blob has three degrees of freedom and isolated sites have two . The backbone is a rigid cluster and therefore has three overall degrees of freedom . We do not need to know n s for our argument . It is enough to notice that n blobs ≤ M red / 3 ∼ L 1 / ν . We can thus write L D B ≤ L 1 / ν ( 1 + m blobs / 3 ) ( 3 ) To this point , we have made no assumption about the character ( compact or fractal ) of the backbone , so it is valid in general . If the transition is second - order , there is a divergent length ( for example , the size of rigid clusters ) , and we expect m blobs to diverge with system size . There - fore a non - trivial value results for D B , as we ﬁnd numer - ically . If on the other hand there is no diverging length in the system , then m blobs → constant for large systems and D B = d = 1 / ν exactly . We thus see that a compact backbone requires an extensive number of cutting bonds , and this in turn can only be satisﬁed if ν = 1 / d exactly [ 42 ] . This is completely inconsistent with our data , and so the possibility of a ﬁrst order backbone is remote in two dimensions . The ﬁrst order rigidity transition exhibited by the braced square net seems to be atypical as we illustrated using a model which tunes continuously from that limit toward the generic triangular lattice . We found that even a small deviation from the braced square lattice limit leads to a behavior similar to that of the triangular lat - tice . It would be intriguing if there were a tricritical point at which ﬁrst order rigidity ceases and second order rigid - ity sets in , but we have not found a model which exhibits that behavior . Nevertheless there are a large number of other rigidity models in two dimensions , so the possibility is not yet ruled out . C . M . acknowledges ﬁnancial support of CNPq and FAPERJ , Brazil .

[ 39 ] We refer in this paper to “inﬁnitesimal rigidity” as rigid - ity for short . Inﬁnitesimal rigidity is a stronger condition than rigidity , and implies that no transformation , even an inﬁnitesimal one , leaves all bar lengths invariant . See e . g . Refs . [ 28 , 27 , 30 ] [ 40 ] C . Moukarzel , ( 1996 ) unpublished . [ 41 ] We deﬁne the mass of the backbone as the number of bonds belonging to it . It is not correct to count sites in rigidity percolation , since they can simultaneously belong to several rigid clusters . [ 42 ] The randomly braced square lattice model has an exten - sive number of cutting bonds , but 1 / ν 6 = 2 . Therefore it apparently violates Coniglio’s relation . The explana - tion is that N R ∼ L 1 / ν only holds for the number of diagonals that are cutting bonds . There are , in addition to those , the cutting bonds which belong to the square lattice substrate , and these are O ( L 2 ) . The reason for a completely ﬁrst - order transition in this model is therefore the existence of an homogeneous , almost rigid substrate ; the square lattice , which provides an extensive number of cutting bonds .

[ 46 ] The Maxwell approximation consists in ignoring the exis - tence of redundant bonds , i . e . assuming that each present bond eliminates one degree of freedom from a total of F = gN . The critical concentration is then obtained by equating f = F / N to zero . 8
