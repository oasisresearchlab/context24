E - Mail : samharris @ ucdavis . edu Cardiac myosin binding protein - C ( cMyBP - C ) is a regulatory protein expressed in cardiac sarcomeres that is known to interact with myosin , titin , and actin . cMyBP - C modulates actomyosin interactions in a phosphorylation dependent way , but it is unclear whether interactions with myosin , titin , or actin are required for these effects . Here we show using cosedimentation binding assays , that the 4 N - terminal domains of murine cMyBP - C ( i . e . , C0 - C1 - m - C2 ) bind to F - actin with a dissociation constant ( K d ) of ~ 10 µM and a molar binding ratio ( B max ) near 1 . 0 , indicating 1 : 1 ( mol / mol ) binding to actin . Electron microscopy and light scattering analyses show that these domains cross - link F - actin filaments , implying multiple sites of interaction with actin . Phosphorylation of the MyBP - C regulatory motif , or m - domain , reduced binding to actin ( reduced B max ) and eliminated actin cross - linking . These results suggest that the N - terminus of cMyBP - C interacts with F - actin through multiple distinct binding sites and that binding at one or more sites is reduced by phosphorylation . Reversible interactions with actin could contribute to effects of cMyBP - C to increase cross - bridge cycling . Cardiac myosin binding protein - C ( cMyBP - C ) is a thick filament accessory protein that performs both structural and regulatory functions within vertebrate sarcomeres . Both roles are likely to be essential in deciphering how a growing number of mutations found in the cMyBP - C gene , i . e . , MYBPC3 , lead to cardiomyopathies and heart failure in a substantial number of the world’s population 1 , 2 . Considerable progress has recently been made in determining the regulatory functions of cMyBP - C and it is now apparent that cMyBP - C normally limits cross - bridge cycling kinetics and is critical for cardiac function 3 - 5 . Phosphorylation of cMyBP - C is essential for its regulatory effects since elimination of phosphorylation sites ( serine to alanine substitutions ) abolishes the ability of protein kinase A ( PKA ) to accelerate cross - bridge cycling kinetics and blunts cardiac responses to inotropic stimuli 6 . The substitutions further impair cardiac function , reduce contractile reserve , and cause cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic mice 6 , 7 . By contrast , substitution of aspartic acids at these sites to mimic constitutive phosphorylation is benign or cardioprotective 8 . While a role for cMyBP - C in modulating cross - bridge kinetics is supported by several transgenic and knockout mouse models 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , the precise mechanisms by which cMyBP - C exerts these effects are not completely understood . For instance , the unique regulatory motif or m - domain of cMyBP - C binds to the S2 subfragment of myosin in vitro 11 and binding is abolished by PKA - mediated phosphorylation of the m - domain 12 . These observations have led to the idea that ( un ) binding of the m - domain from myosin S2 mediates PKA - induced increases in cross - bridge cycling kinetics . Consistent with this idea , Calaghan and colleagues 13 showed that S2 added to transiently permeabilized myocytes increased their contractility , presumably because added S2 http : / / www . jbc . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1074 / jbc .

However , other reports indicate that cMyBP - C can influence actomyosin interactions through mechanisms unrelated to S2 binding , since either purified cMyBP - C 14 or recombinant N - terminal domains of cMyBP - C 15 affected acto - S1 filament sliding velocities and ATPase rates in the absence of myosin S2 . These results thus raise the possibility that interactions with ligands other than myosin S2 , such as actin or myosin S1 , contribute to effects of cMyBP - C on cross - bridge interaction kinetics . The idea that cMyBP - C interacts with actin to influence cross - bridge cycling kinetics is supported by several studies that implicate the regulatory m - domain or sequences near it in actin binding 16 - 19 . cMyBP - C is a member of the Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) superfamily of proteins and consists of 11 repeating domains that bear homology to either Ig or fibronectin - like folds . Domains are numbered sequentially from the N - terminus of cMyBP - C as C0 through C10 . The m - domain , a unique sequence of ~ 100 amino acids , is located between domains C1 and C2 and is phosphorylated on at least 3 serine residues by PKA 12 . Although the precise structure of the m - domain is not known , small angle X - ray scattering data suggest that it is compact and folded in solution and is thus similar in size and dimensions to the surrounding Ig domains 20 . Recombinant proteins encompassing the m - domain and / or a combination of adjacent domains including C0 , C1 , C2 and a proline - alanine rich sequence that links C0 to C1 have been shown to bind actin 16 , 18 , 19 . The purpose of the present study was to characterize binding interactions of the N - terminus of cMyBP - C with actin and to determine whether interactions with actin are influenced by phosphorylation of the m - domain . Results demonstrate that the N - terminus of cMyBP - C binds to F - actin and to native thin filaments with affinities similar to that reported for cMyBP - C binding to myosin S2 11 . Furthermore , actin binding was reduced by m - domain phosphorylation , suggesting that reversible interactions of cMyBP - C with actin could contribute to modulation of cross - bridge kinetics . Experimental Procedures Protein Expression and Purification . Recombinant murine cMyBP - C proteins containing various combinations of N - terminal domains with and without the m - domain were cloned and purified as described previously 18 , 21 . In some cases proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography ( Bio - rad , Hercules , CA ) . All proteins were centrifuged for 20 min at 120 , 000 rpm ( 511 , 000 x g ) and 4 o C in a TLA 120 . 2 rotor in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , CA ) prior to use to remove any insoluble material . Final protein concentration was determined by UV spectrometry using extinction coefficients calculated from amino acid primary sequences and software from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics website 22 . At least two separate preparations of recombinant cMyBP - C proteins were used for each experimental data set . Rabbit skeletal myosin S1 was prepared by chymotryptic digestion of myosin in the presence of EDTA as described 23 . Myosin S2 Δ ( comprised of the N - terminal 126 amino acids of myosin S2 11 ) was prepared by RT - PCR of RNA isolated from rat heart and subsequent cDNA cloning into the pQE - 2 expression vector ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . Because of the low percentage of aromatic amino acids in the S2 Δ sequence that precludes accurate measurement of concentration by UV spectrometry , the concentration of purified S2 Δ was determined by amino acid analysis performed by the UC Davis Molecular Structure Facility . Bovine cardiac F - actin was prepared from ether powder as described 24 . F - actin was maintained in a storage buffer ( in mmol / L : 50 KCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 2 Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 BME , 1 ATP , and 0 . 02 % sodium azide ) and kept at 4 o C until use . Native thin filaments ( NTF ) were purified from bovine heart left ventricle according to a modification of the protocol by Speiss et al . 25 Four volumes of buffer ( in mmol / L : 10 KPO 4 , pH 7 . 0 , 100 KCl , 5 MgCl 2 , 1 EGTA , 1 NaN 3 , 1 DTT , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) were added to ventricle minced in a Waring grinder and the tissue was homogenized using a Polytron PT3100 . Protease inhibitor cocktail ( in mg / mL : 0 . 01 PMSF , 0 . 001 leupeptin , 0 . 001 pepstatin , 0 . 001 antipain ) was added and the solution spun at 3800 rpm for 13 a t U n i v e r s i t y o f C a li f o r n i a , D a v i s on A p r il 14 , 200 9 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The cMyBP - C Motif Binds Actin 3 min with a JS - 4 . 2 rotor ( Beckman ) . The pellet was homogenized , resuspended , and centrifuged again 4 more times with the last 3 in buffer lacking Triton X - 100 . Next , the pellet containing myofibrils was homogenized in 1 . 6 volumes of buffer plus 5 mM ATP to dissociate the thin and thick filaments . The solution was spun as above and the pellets ( containing mostly thick filaments ) discarded . The supernatant was then spun at 70 , 000 rpm for 15 min ( Beckman Type 70 Ti rotor ) , the pellet discarded , then the supernatant spun again for 80 min . The pellets ( containing mostly thin filaments ) were resuspended in 25 ml of dialysis buffer ( in mmol / L : 20 Tris - HCl , 100 KCl , 5 MgCl 2 , 1 EGTA , 1 NaN 3 , 1 DTT ) using a Dounce homogenizer and dialyzed overnight . The following day , the solution was brought to 200 mM KCl and 5 mM ATP and spun at 45 , 000 rpm for 15 min ( Beckman Type 50 . 2 rotor ) to remove any contaminating myosin . Pellets were discarded , and the supernatant was spun again for 150 min . The pellets were resuspended as above and dialyzed overnight . The purification cycle ( centrifugation for 15 min , pellet discard , and centrifugation for 150 min ) was repeated again the next day . Final pellets were overlaid with NTF buffer ( in mmol / L : 5 imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 KCl , 2 MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 ATP , 0 . 5 DTT ) overnight to soften . The pellets were resuspended gently with a pipette and spun at 19 , 500 rpm for 30 min ( Beckman JA - 20 rotor ) to remove debris and aggregated material . NTF concentration was measured by UV spectrometry using an extinction coefficient ( 280 nm ) = 0 . 0529 µM - 1 cm - 1 and molecular weight = 62 , 500 Da per actin for the thin filament complex ( 7 : 1 : 1 actin : tropomyosin : troponin ) . Ca 2 + regulation of purified NTF was confirmed prior to use in cosedimentation assays by measuring actin activated S1 - ATPase rates as described previously 15 except buffers contained 1mM EGTA . Activity was 0 . 2 ± 0 . 1 s - 1 in the absence of Ca 2 + and 3 . 3 ± 0 . 9 s - 1 ( n = 6 ) in the presence of Ca 2 + ( pCa 3 ) . Phosphorylation of recombinant C1C2 was achieved by incubation with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A ( PKA , Sigma P2645 ) . C1C2 was dialyzed against a buffer containing ( in mmol / L : 20 HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 100 KCl , 10 MgCl 2 , 1 ATP , and 1 DTT ) . PKA was resuspended in 6 mg / ml DTT per manufacturer’s instructions and combined with an additional 1mM ATP and C1C2 at 40 U PKA / mg C1C2 . The reaction mixture was incubated at 4 o C for > 5 h and then applied to a Ni - NTA column ( Qiagen ) to purify phosphorylated C1C2 and remove the PKA catalytic subunit . Phosphorylation status was assessed by Pro Q Diamond staining followed by Sypro Ruby staining ( Invitrogen , Carslbad , CA ) . Cosedimentation Assays . Recombinant cMyBP - C proteins were dialyzed against a cosedimentation buffer ( in mmol / L : 20 imidazole , pH 7 . 4 , 180 KCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 1 EGTA , 1 DTT ) . F - actin remained in its storage buffer prior to use . Recombinant cMyBP - C proteins ( 1 – 30 µM final concentrations ) were combined with sufficient F - actin , ATP , and DTT to achieve final concentrations of 5 µM , 1 mM , and 1 mM , respectively , in a total final volume of 50 µl cosedimentation buffer . For experiments with S2 Δ , a six - fold excess of S2 Δ ( 30 µM ) to actin was added to each tube . Reactions were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at room temperature . Samples were then spun for 30 min at 100 , 000 rpm ( 390 , 000 x g ) using a TLA 100 rotor at 4 o C ( Beckman ) . The supernatants were removed from each tube and the pellets gently washed with 50 µl of cosedimentation buffer and dissolved in 100 µl of a 1 : 1 mix of cosedimentation buffer to urea - thiourea sample buffer 26 . Pellet fractions were loaded onto 10 % polyacrylamide gels and run at constant 200 V for 50 min . Gels were stained for at least one hour in 0 . 05 % Coomassie R - 250 staining solution , followed by destaining and drying overnight . Quantification of Binding Data . Dried gels were scanned to a computer using a flatbed scanner and band intensities were measured using the gel analysis features of Image J ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) . The intensity ratio of recombinant protein to F - actin in each pellet was converted to a molar ratio ( mol cMyBP - C / mol actin ) using standard curves run on each gel that contained known amounts of cMyBP - C and actin in mol / mol ratios ( Figure 1 ) . Standard curves were constructed by adding 40 pmol of actin to each of 7 tubes followed by addition of increasing amounts of recombinant protein ( 4 - 40 pmol ) to achieve the desired mole ratio . A fixed volume from each standard tube ( 3 . 5 µ l ) was loaded onto the gel so that the amount of actin typically varied from 13 to 7 . 8 pmol across the wells of the standard curve . This range was a t U n i v e r s i t y o f C a li f o r n i a , D a v i s on A p r il 14 , 200 9 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The cMyBP - C Motif Binds Actin 4 selected to verify that staining intensity was linear over the amount of actin ( 10 . 6 pmol ) loaded in each cosedimentation assay . Cosedimentation binding data was plotted versus the total cMyBP - C concentration added and fit according to the following equation 27 : where [ C bound ] and [ C free ] are the bound and free concentrations of cMyBP - C proteins , respectively , [ Actin ] is the total actin concentration , B max is the maximal molar binding ratio ( mol cMyBP - C protein / mol actin ) , and K d is the dissociation constant ( µM ) . Eq . 1 can be rearranged by substituting Eq . 2 in for [ C free ] and solving for [ C bound ] / [ Actin ] in order to fit the data as a function of total cMyBP - C protein added ( [ C total ] , ) as shown in Eq . 3 . Data were fit using the Microsoft Excel Solver package by varying the values of B max and K d while minimizing the sum of squares between the actual and predicted binding ratios . Significance was calculated using ANOVA and post - hoc Bonferonni’s t - tests . Results were considered significant at P < 0 . 01 . Analysis of Actin Cross - linking . Actin crosslinking was assessed by measurement of solution turbidity as described by Moos et al . 28 Samples containing mixtures of recombinant cMyBP - C proteins and F - actin were prepared as described above for cosedimentation assays and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at room temperature . Light absorbance at λ = 350 nm was measured using a Beckman DU730 spectrophotometer . Samples containing F - actin alone served as blanks . Electron Microscopy . 5 µ M F - actin and 30 µ M recombinant proteins were mixed as described for cosedimentation assays with the exception that the centrifugation step prior to combining the proteins was omitted . Samples were incubated at room temperature for > 30 min and 5 µ l aliquots of each sample were applied to a freshly evaporated carbon film supported by holey formvar covered grids . After adsorption to the carbon film ( 30 sec ) , excess sample was rinsed off with 8 drops of 100 mM ammonium acetate . The ammonium acetate rinse was followed by application of 8 drops of 1 % uranyl acetate for negative staining . Excess uranyl acetate was removed with filter paper after 30 sec leaving a thin film of negative stain which was then allowed to dry . Dried grids were examined and photographed at 80kV in a JEOL - 1200EXII electron microscope equipped with a 2k x 2k AMT HR60 High resolution Digital Camera ( AMT , Danvers , MA ) . RESULTS The Regulatory Motif of cMyBP - C Binds to F - actin . We sought to quantify binding interactions between the cMyBP - C N - terminus and actin by measuring binding affinity between the 4 N - terminal domains of cMyBP - C ( i . e . , C0C2 comprised of C0 - C1 - m - C2 and inclusive of the proline - alanine rich linker sequence between C0 and C1 ) and F - actin using high speed cosedimentation assays . C0C2 is soluble at physiological ionic strength in the absence of actin and does not sediment during high speed centrifugation . However , when combined with F - actin , C0C2 readily pellets along with actin ( Figure 1 ) , suggesting binding interactions between the two proteins . Binding was saturable at approximately a 1 : 1 molar ratio of C0C2 bound to actin ( B max = 0 . 92 ± 0 . 11 ) and a K d of 13 . 7 ± 5 . 5 µM ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ) . C1C2 ( i . e . , C1 - m - C2 , which lacks the cardiac specific C0 domain and the proline - alanine rich region preceding C1 ) also bound to actin with comparable affinity ( K d = 10 . 9 ± 2 . 2 µM and B max = 1 . 03 ± 0 . 08 ) , suggesting that the C0 domain and the Pro - Ala rich region do not significantly influence interactions with actin under these assay conditions . To further map actin binding site ( s ) to specific domains of cMyBP - C , we first divided the 4 N - terminal domains of cMyBP - C into two non - overlapping recombinant fragments , C0C1 ( inclusive of the Pro - Ala region ) and mC2 , and quantified binding of each subfragment to actin . As shown in Figure 2 , C0C1 binding to actin was significantly reduced compared to C0C2 , with K d a t U n i v e r s i t y o f C a li f o r n i a , D a v i s on A p r il 14 , 200 9 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The cMyBP - C Motif Binds Actin 5 = 40 . 4 ± 16 . 8 µM and B max = 0 . 45 ± 0 . 10 . Although binding appeared saturable , the data could also be fit well to a straight line , suggesting that binding of C0C1 was weak and non - specific or electrostatic in nature . By contrast , the binding affinity of mC2 ( Figure 2 ) was saturable with an affinity ( K d = 10 . 5 ± 4 . 7 µM ) similar to that of C0C2 , although the total amount of mC2 bound was reduced as shown by a decrease in B max ( 0 . 59 ± 0 . 13 ) . To determine whether the m - domain was responsible for binding of mC2 , we also investigated binding of the m - domain in combination with C1 , i . e . C1m . As shown in Figure 2 , the K d for C1m binding to actin was 8 . 7 ± 2 . 4 µM , not significantly different from that of C0C2 . B max ( 0 . 92 ± 0 . 14 ) was also near 1 . 0 indicating a 1 : 1 binding stoichiometry comparable to C0C2 . Thus , the m - domain in combination with C1 completely recapitulated the actin binding properties of the larger C0C2 fragment . Because C1m and mC2 both bound to actin with similar affinities , we next investigated whether the m - domain alone was sufficient to confer actin binding properties to a segment of cMyBP - C that does not bind actin . As shown in Figure 3 , the recombinant protein , C3C4 , consisting of domains C3 and C4 of cMyBP - C , binds F - actin non - specifically as determined by its linear actin binding relation . However , when the m - domain was inserted between domains C3 and C4 to create the C3mC4 protein , saturable binding to actin was observed . The K d for binding was 11 . 2 ± 3 . 3 µM , not significantly different from C0C2 ( Table 1 ) . These data thus demonstrate that the regulatory m - domain of cMyBP - C binds specifically to actin and that binding is of sufficient affinity to contribute to the binding properties observed for C0C2 . However , the total amount of C3mC4 bound to actin was significantly reduced compared to C0C2 ( B max = 0 . 50 ± 0 . 09 versus 0 . 92 ± 0 . 11 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Multiple Actin Binding Sites of C0C2 Cross - Link F - Actin . A straightforward explanation for the 1 : 1 molar binding stoichiometry observed for C0C2 , C1C2 , and C1m is that each molecule binds to a single binding site on an actin monomer . However , a different model is needed to account for the reduced binding ratios ( ~ 1 : 2 actin ) observed for C3mC4 or mC2 . One possibility is that instead of binding to a single site on actin the C1 and m - domains bind to independent sites such that the total amount of protein bound to F - actin ( 1 : 1 for C1m , C1C2 , and C0C2 ) reflects contributions from each of two independent sites ( ~ 0 . 5 mol / mol actin for each site ) . To test this idea , we assessed the ability of various domains to cross - link actin filaments since cross - linking depends on the presence of multiple interaction sites with each site interacting with a different filament to form bundles or meshes 29 . The extent of cross - linking can be quantified by measuring solution turbidity as assessed by light absorbance at 350 nm 28 , 30 . As shown in Figure 4 , combining C0C2 with F - actin under conditions identical to those used for cosedimentation assays significantly increased solution turbidity relative to C0C2 alone , consistent with the idea that addition of C0C2 to F - actin promotes the formation of actin cross - links or bundles . C1C2 and C1m also increased turbidity , whereas C0C1 , mC2 , C3C4 , and C3mC4 did not . Because proteins that did not increase turbidity all lacked one or both the C1 and m - domains , the results suggest that both C1 and the m - domains contain actin binding sites . To confirm that the observed increases in solution turbidity corresponded to actin bundling , electron microscopy was used to visualize F - actin filaments in the presence and absence of recombinant proteins . As shown in Figure 5 , F - actin in the absence of recombinant cMyBP - C proteins ( Figure 5A ) appeared as single filaments deposited randomly on the grid surface . Punctate staining was also visible and was likely due to aggregation of actin monomers . By contrast , when combined with C0C2 or C1C2 , F - actin formed thick tightly packed bundles ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . Thick , regularly packed bundles were also readily apparent in the presence of C1m ( Figure 5D ) , although the extent of bundling as determined by the number and thickness of the bundles was somewhat reduced . The extent and quality of bundling was further diminished in the presence of C0C1 ( Figure 5E ) or mC2 ( Figure 5F ) since few bundles were observed and those that were seen were less regular and less tightly packed than those formed in the presence of C0C2 , C1C2 , or C1m . In particular , a regular side - by - side arrangement of filaments was not observed in the presence of C0C1 . Instead , filaments appeared a t U n i v e r s i t y o f C a li f o r n i a , D a v i s on A p r il 14 , 200 9 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The cMyBP - C Motif Binds Actin 6 only loosely connected ( Figure 5H ) . This infrequent , loose association was most likely the result of non - specific accumulation of filaments around protein aggregates rather than from actin cross - linking . The bundles formed by mC2 ( Figure 5I ) appeared somewhat better organized than those formed in the presence of C0C1 , but their thickness and frequency were still significantly reduced compared to C0C2 , C1C2 , or C1m . Thus , tight , regularly packed bundles indicative of actin cross - linking were most commonly observed in the presence of C0C2 , C1C2 , and C1m , a result in good agreement with solution turbidity measurements . While it is unlikely that the C1 and m - domain promote actin bundling in vivo because of reduced protein stoichiometry of cMyBP - C to actin in sarcomeres , the presence of regulatory proteins , and other constraints on sarcomere geometry , the results provide evidence for multiple independent actin binding sites on the C1 and m - domains of cMyBP - C . Phosphorylation of the MyBP - C M - Domain Reduces Binding to F - Actin . To investigate whether actin binding by cMyBP - C is affected by phosphorylation of the m - domain , we phosphorylated C1C2 using the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A ( PKA ) and assessed the ability of phosphorylated C1C2 ( i . e . , C1C2P ) to bind actin or to cross - link filaments . Pro Q Diamond staining confirmed C1C2 phosphorylation following PKA treatment ( Figure 6A , inset ) . Compared to C1C2 , C1C2P bound to actin with similar affinity ( K d 13 . 3 ± 2 . 8 µM ) . However , overall binding was significantly reduced as indicated by a decrease in B max ( 0 . 49 ± 0 . 16 ) . Phosphorylation of C1C2 also abolished its ability to cross - link actin filaments since the low turbidity of F - actin solutions was unchanged upon addition of C1C2P ( Figure 6B ) . The latter reduction in the ability to induce actin cross - linking suggests that binding through at least one of the sites is eliminated by phosphorylation of the m - domain . Because the m - domain is highly basic ( isoelectric point > 9 . 0 ) and phosphorylation is expected to reduce its positive charge , we also investigated whether decreasing the net charge of the m - domain by increasing pH could affect binding of C1C2 to actin . As shown in Figure 6C , increasing solution pH to 8 . 0 had effects on binding similar to phosphorylation , i . e . , total binding of C1C2 was reduced ( B max 0 . 65 ± 0 . 10 ) and actin cross - linking was abolished ( Figure 6D ) . Together these results suggest that the actin binding properties of the N - terminus of cMyBP - C can be modulated by electrostatic charge or by phosphorylation of the m - domain . S2 ∆ Does Not Compete with cMyBP - C for Actin Binding . We next investigated whether myosin S2 competes with C1C2 to prevent binding to actin since the regulatory m - domain is known to bind the first 126 N - terminal residues of myosin S2 , referred to as S2 ∆ 11 . Figure 7A shows results of cosedimentation experiments performed with C1C2 in the presence of 30 µM S2 ∆ . The binding relationship between C1C2 and F - actin was not significantly affected by S2 Δ since binding parameters obtained in the presence of S2 Δ ( K d = 15 . 4 ± 3 . 0 µM and B max = 0 . 97 ± 0 . 10 ) were not significantly different than for C1C2 in the absence of S2 Δ ( compare to Figure 1 , K d = 10 . 9 ± 2 . 2 µM and B max = 1 . 03 ± 0 . 08 ) . In separate experiments ( Figure 7B ) , increasing the concentration of S2 Δ up to 50 µM while maintaining the concentration of C1C2 constant at 10 µM , also did not affect the amount of C1C2 or S2 Δ found in each pellet . These results demonstrate that binding of the m - domain to F - actin is not diminished by competition of the m - domain with S2 Δ . The M - Domain Binds to Thin Filaments Independent of Ca 2 + . Results from this study thus far demonstrate that the 4 N - terminal domains of cMyBP - C bind to F - actin through interactions involving multiple domains . To determine whether these interactions persist in regulated thin filaments where the binding of cMyBP - C to actin may be affected by the presence of regulatory proteins 16 , we performed cosedimentation binding assays using purified native thin filaments and C1C2 . As shown in Figure 8 , binding of C1C2 to native thin filaments was saturable in the absence of Ca 2 + ( K d = 12 . 5 ± 4 . 8 µM and B max = 0 . 90 ± 0 . 13 ) and binding was unchanged in the presence of Ca 2 + ( K d = 8 . 4 ± 4 . 6 µM and B max = 0 . 90 ± 0 . 13 ) . The K d and B max values obtained for C1C2 binding to thin filaments in the presence or absence of Ca 2 + were not significantly different from those obtained for binding to F - actin alone ( Table 1 ) . Together these data suggest that cMyBP - C binds with similar affinity to either F - a t U n i v e r s i t y o f C a li f o r n i a , D a v i s on A p r il 14 , 200 9 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The cMyBP - C Motif Binds Actin 7 actin or regulated thin filaments and that binding is not affected by Ca 2 + activation of thin filaments . DISCUSSION The major finding from this study is that the unique regulatory motif or m - domain of MyBP - C binds to F - actin and to native thin filaments in a specific , saturable manner with K d = ~ 10 µM . The interaction occurs at physiological ionic strength and is reduced by phosphorylation or by increasing pH , indicating that binding is influenced by electrostatic charge interactions . These data demonstrate that the N - terminus of cMyBP - C can interact in a reversible manner with actin and thus raise the possibility that interactions of cMyBP - C with the thin filament contribute to intropic acceleration of cross - bridge cycling following phosphorylation of cMyBP - C . The results show that the m - domain of cMyBP - C alone is sufficient to bind actin since addition of the m - domain to two Ig domains ( C3 and C4 ) that do not bind actin conferred saturable binding with an affinity similar to that of C1C2 ( Figure 3 ) . Until now the only other binding partner identified for the m - domain was the S2 subfragment of myosin 11 , 12 . Binding of the m - domain to myosin S2 was inferred from binding of C1C2 ( which contains the m - domain ) to myosin minifilaments and to a smaller recombinant protein containing the first 126 N - terminal residues of myosin S2 ( i . e . , S2 ∆ ) 11 . The K d for the interaction was ~ 7 µM and binding was eliminated by phosphorylation of the m - domain 12 . Interactions of the flanking domains , i . e . , C1 and C2 , with S2 ∆ were also demonstrated for each domain separately using NMR , but binding affinities were not determined in those studies and high protein concentrations ( 200 - 800 µM ) were necessary to obtain NMR spectra 31 , 32 . In the present study the binding affinity of the m - domain ( C3mC4 , Figure 3 ) for actin was similar to that reported for C1C2 binding to S2 ∆ . However , we found that S2 ∆ did not compete with actin for binding to C1C2 ( Figures 7A and 7B ) , suggesting that the affinity of the m - domain for actin is greater than for S2 . Since the present experiments were performed at higher ionic strength than those originally used to measure the affinity of C1C2 for S2 11 , the affinity of C1C2 for S2 ∆ may be reduced under the high salt conditions . If so , then it is possible that the m - domain preferentially binds actin rather than S2 in vivo as well . Alternatively , binding sites for the two ligands may be separate and non - overlapping and binding of C1C2 to either actin or S2 could occur independent of one another . Additional actin binding site ( s ) outside of the m - domain were implied by the ability of C1C2 to cross - link actin since cross - linking depends on the presence of multiple binding sites . Because the minimal domains required for cross - linking were the C1 and m - domains , the results imply that a second binding site for actin exists within the C1 domain . C0 might also contribute to actin binding since the extent of cross - linking as assessed by solution turbidity was somewhat greater in the presence of C0C2 compared to either C1C2 or C1m ( Figure 4 ) . However , the relative contribution of the C0 domain to actin binding is likely to be small because C1C2 ( which lacks C0 and the proline - alanine rich region preceding C1 ) bound to actin with an affinity comparable to C0C2 ( Figure 1 ) . In addition , C0C1 bound poorly , if at all , to actin suggesting that C0 contributes little to actin binding under these conditions ( Figure 2 ) . The finding that C0C1 bound only weakly was somewhat unexpected since cross - linking results as discussed above indicated a binding site within C1 that should still be able to cosediment with actin even if C0 does not . A possible explanation for the discrepancy is that C1 ( and / or C0 ) binding to actin is strengthened by the presence of the m - domain . According to this scenario , C1 might bind more tightly to actin when stabilized at its C - terminus by the m - domain as in C0C2 but not when the m - domain is absent as in C0C1 . If so , then mutations linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that are clustered near the C - terminus of C1 20 , 32 could disrupt C1 interactions with the m - domain and reduce binding of C1 to actin . While the present results demonstrate that multiple binding sites for actin exist within the N - terminus of cMyBP - C , the sites appear to be distinct and differentially affected by phosphorylation . This is because phosphorylation reduced , but did not abolish , binding of C1C2 to actin ( Figure 6 ) , indicating that binding via at least one of the sites persists even following phosphorylation of the m - domain . Since cross - a t U n i v e r s i t y o f C a li f o r n i a , D a v i s on A p r il 14 , 200 9 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The cMyBP - C Motif Binds Actin 8 linking was eliminated either by phosphorylation of the m - domain or by increasing pH , the simplest explanation is that binding of the m - domain to actin is affected whereas binding via the C1 domain is not . This idea is depicted schematically in Figure 9 in a model that accounts for actin cross - linking and the effects of pH and phosphorylation on actin binding . As shown in Figure 9A , the N - terminus of cMyBP - C binds to F - actin in the unphosphorylated state primarily through interactions that involve binding sites on the C1 and m - domains along with possible contributions from C0 . However , upon phosphorylation of the m - domain or an increase in pH , reduced net positive charge of the m - domain reduces its affinity for actin and the m - domain becomes unbound ( Figure 9B ) . At the same time , binding of the C1 domain is largely unaffected by electrostatic interactions and it remains bound to actin , thereby accounting for continued C1C2 - actin binding even following phosphorylation of the m - domain ( Figure 6 ) . Note that binding of cMyBP - C to actin is depicted in Figure 9 as less than the 1 : 1 stoichiometry measured here to reflect the occurrence of cMyBP - C in sarcomeres only at discreet locations along thick filament A - bands 33 , 34 . Structural evidence in support of the m - domain in the unbound configuration ( Figure 9B ) was recently obtained by Whitten et al . 16 who modeled the interaction of C0C2 with F - actin from neutron scattering data collected in solution at pH 8 . 0 . In good agreement with binding data presented here , Whitten et al . concluded that C0C2 bound to F - actin through interactions with C1 and C0 , whereas the m - domain appeared unbound at the higher pH . The model shown in Figure 9 also complements recent functional observations which demonstrated that the C1 and m - domains constitute a functional subunit of cMyBP - C 21 . Together the C1 and m - domains increased Ca 2 + sensitivity of tension , rates of tension redevelopment at submaximal [ Ca 2 + ] , and activated force at low levels of Ca 2 + in permeabilized rat trabeculae . These functional observations suggested that the C1 and m - domains create a functional unit that can potently activate the thin filament . The present results extend these observations and suggest that activating effects of the C1 and m - domains are mediated by binding to actin . Binding of the C1 and m - domains to actin could influence the activation state of the thin filament and / or cross - bridge cycling through several mechanisms . One possibility is that binding of C1 and the m - domain to actin directly activates the thin filament by affecting the position of tropomyosin as proposed by Whitten et al . 16 who predicted that the position of C0C2 on F - actin would clash sterically with tropomyosin in the Ca 2 + off state . Binding of C1 and the m - domain could thus compete with and displace tropomyosin , thereby facilitating cross - bridge binding and cycling . A related prediction of this scenario is that binding of cMyBP - C to thin filaments may be increased in the presence of Ca 2 + when the position of tropomyosin on the thin filament is shifted 35 - 37 . However , we found that C1C2 bound to thin filaments regardless of the presence or absence of Ca 2 + ( Figure 8 ) , suggesting that steric clash with tropomyosin does not significantly limit C1C2 binding to actin . Consistent with these observations , Yamamoto 38 also found that binding of skeletal MyBP - C to thin filaments was robust regardless of whether or not Ca 2 + was present , although somewhat more binding was apparent in the presence of Ca 2 + . Since skeletal thin filaments are more completely activated by Ca 2 + alone whereas cardiac thin filaments also require strongly bound cross - bridges 39 , 40 , differences between our results and those of Yamamoto 38 may reflect differences in the relative sensitivity of skeletal and cardiac thin filaments to activation by Ca 2 + . While displacement of tropomyosin by the C1 and m - domains could provide an explanation for the activating effects of the N - terminus of cMyBP - C when added exogenously to motility assays or permeabilized myocytes 18 , 21 , 41 , an apparent paradox is how phosphorylation of the m - domain which decreases binding to actin as shown here ( Figure 6 ) can account for increased cross - bridge cycling in vivo 6 . That is , how can movement of the m - domain to the unbound state ( Figure 9B ) account for acceleration of cross - bridge cycling following phosphorylation by PKA 6 ? Although experiments presented here do not directly address this question , several explanations are possible . The first is that binding a t U n i v e r s i t y o f C a li f o r n i a , D a v i s on A p r il 14 , 200 9 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The cMyBP - C Motif Binds Actin 9 of the m - domain to actin in the unphosphorylated state could block or alters myosin - S1 cross - bridge binding and thereby limits cross - bridge attachment to the thin filament . Phosphorylation of the m - domain and unbinding from actin could thus promote myosin binding and thereby accelerate cross - bridge cycling . Alternatively , unbinding of the m - domain from actin could free the m - domain for interactions with other ligands , such as myosin S1 or S2 , myosin light chains 32 , 42 or thin filament regulatory proteins . Such interactions could affect cross - bridge cycling kinetics by influencing the position or docking of myosin S1 heads onto the thin filament or by activating the thin filament in a manner analogous to the way in which TnI unbinding actin promotes thin filament activation 43 , 44 . A significant result from this study is that binding of the C1 domain to actin persists even following phosphorylation and unbinding of the m - domain from actin . This result suggests that cMyBP - C can tether the thick and thin filaments together regardless of the phosphorylation state of the m - domain . If so , then cMyBP - C could structurally couple thick and thin filaments together . Such coupling could potentially influence cross - bridge cycling kinetics by creating a drag that slows sarcomere shortening as considered by Hofmann and colleagues 45 or by modulating sarcomere lattice spacing . In support of the latter idea , phosphorylation of myofilament proteins by PKA increased sarcomere lattice spacing in cMyBP - C knockout mice , but not in wild - type mice 46 , suggesting that cMyBP - C normally restricts lattice expansion . In summary , we have shown that the C1 and m - domains of cMyBP - C bind to actin . The m - domain of cMyBP - C binds reversibly to actin in a phosphorylation dependent manner , whereas C1 binding to actin is unaffected by phosphorylation . Reversible binding and unbinding of the m - domain to actin could thereby influence cross - bridge cycling in response to inotropic agonists , whereas phosphorylation independent binding of C1 to actin could maintain close coupling of thick and thin filaments regardless of phosphorylation state . Such coupling could ensure optimal lattice spacing as sarcomere shortening ensues and thereby help to maintain efficient cross - bridge interactions throughout the cardiac cycle .
