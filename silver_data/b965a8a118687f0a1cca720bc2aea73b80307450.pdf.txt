Design ﬁxation is related to the broad phenomenon of unconscious cognition bias that hinders the generation of creative solutions during the conceptual design process . While numerous research studies have gone into the study of design ﬁxation , the ex - perimental methods used were external to the cognitive process of designers ; thus , there are some limitations . To address these limitations , the present study utilized electroencephalography ( EEG ) to explore the diﬀerences in neural activities between designers with diﬀerent degrees of design ﬁxation during creative idea generation . Fluency , ﬂexibility , and the degree of copying were used to evaluate the design performance and ﬁxation degrees of all participants ; for the follow - up analyses on brain activity patterns , participants were then divided into the Higher Fixation Group and the Lower Fixation Group according to the evaluation of the degrees of copying . Next , participants in each group were contrasted separately against the task - related alpha power changes during creative idea generation . The comparison results revealed that participants with lower design ﬁxation demonstrated stronger alpha synchronization in frontal , parietotemporal , and occipital regions during creative idea generation , while participants with higher design ﬁxation showed stronger task - related alpha desynchronization in frontal , centroparietal , and parietotemporal regions . Such ﬁndings suggested that participants with higher ﬁxation showed lower solution ﬂexibility because of the inability to inhibit the solutions generated overrelying on intuition . These results could contribute to a deeper under - standing of design ﬁxation from the neuroscience perspective and provide essential theoretical supports for the subsequent deﬁxation methods and tool development . 1 . Introduction In studies on design inspiration and design innovation , some researchers have revealed the design ﬁxation eﬀect on providing example solutions as an external stimulus to designers during creative idea generation [ 1 – 3 ] . Design ﬁxation , which was originally deﬁned as the designer blindly adhered to a set of limited ideas or concepts during con - ceptual design [ 4 ] , would restrict designers’ creative thinking and hinder the creation of novel solutions [ 5 ] . As design studies continue to attract researchers and scholars from a wide range of technical ﬁelds , design ﬁxation has been commonly mentioned in studies of creativity and custom - arily referred to the situation where designers’ creative thinking was restricted due to the overreliance on a series of existing design solutions or the knowledge related to present design problems [ 5 – 7 ] ; it is unconsciously [ 3 , 8 ] and hap - pened to both expert and novice designers [ 3 , 9 ] . Design ﬁxation is thought to occur at the very early stage of the design process , the conceptual design process [ 3 – 5 ] , during which solutions generated have a decisive eﬀect on the ultimate outcomes . Simply stated , the occurrence of ﬁxation would impede the conceptual design process , which would thus lead to strong convergence and lower novelty of so - lutions or concepts generated by designers , while innovation is the core of the conceptual design . To resolve this conﬂict , it is important to have a better understanding of creativity in design and the barriers that block it [ 10 – 12 ] . Existing design ﬁxation researches have already made good progress . However , the experimental techniques used are quite HindawiComputational Intelligence and Neuroscience Volume 2021 , Article ID 6619598 , 10 pages https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2021 / 6619598 homogeneous [ 2 ] and are external to the internal cognitive process of the participants ; thus , there are some limitations in exploring the cognitive activities during the occurrence of design ﬁxation . The present study utilized EEG technology , which could record the neural responses of participants in real - time and noninvasively , aiming to deeply explore the neural activities involved in the occurrence of diﬀerent degrees of design ﬁxation . Crilly and Cardoso [ 11 ] highly summarized that design ﬁxation is a state where designers had an unconscious bias due to previous experience , knowledge , or assumptions , which leads to the limited exploration of design space when fulﬁlling a design task . To explain such cognition bias in design researches , the dual - processing model of cognition which shows the existence of two distinct systems ( one is the intuition system ( System 1 ) and the other is the rationality system ( System 2 ) ) of thinking [ 13 – 15 ] was introduced in the present study . This oﬀered an interesting perspective in design ﬁxation studies : during the creative idea generation process , through System 1 , solutions were generated relying on intuition , experience , and memories . Then , System 2 tries to inhibit these intuition - generated solutions through rea - soning and calculation or directly following the solutions proposed in System 1 . When System 2 directly follows System 1 without any further consideration , design ﬁxation occurs , and this is what researchers called following “the path of least resistance” [ 16 – 19 ] . Therefore , design ﬁxation during creative idea generation occurred because the par - ticipants failed to inhibit the solutions generated relying on intuition . This assumption could be conﬁrmed by the ex - perimental results of some typical design ﬁxation studies [ 20 , 21 ] . And in the present study , we want to further identify this assumption from the perspective of neuroscience . Nowadays , EEG has become a very powerful and con - venient method to investigate cognitive processes , which plays an important role in the creativity of researches . Re - search studies on the relationships between activities of EEG alpha - band ( 8 – 13 Hz ) and creative idea generation produced some reliable , consistent , and robust views on the roles of the task - related alpha - band ( synchronization or desynchroni - zation ) during the creative idea generation [ 22 , 23 ] . How - ever , there are few studies on the intersection of EEG and design researches , especially on design ﬁxation . Recently , Camarda et al . [ 24 ] have gone into the study of the rela - tionships between functional ﬁxedness and alpha - band power changes in both the frontal and temporoparietal regions during creative idea generation using the Alternative Uses Task adapted for EEG recording . However , it should be noted that in the study of Camarda et al . [ 24 ] participants were only required to complete the Alternative Uses Task without any additional problem - solving task or the speciﬁc design task . This made their ﬁndings limited and might not be applicable to ﬁxation eﬀects induced in other contexts such as the design ﬁxation eﬀect . Therefore , in the present study , participants were asked to ﬁnish a speciﬁc design task , and we wanted to determine whether the ﬁndings observed in their study could also be identiﬁed in the present study . The present study aimed to explore neural activity patterns of designers with higher and lower ﬁxation during creative idea generation through EEG technology . Partici - pants were required to generate as many solutions as pos - sible to ﬁnish the design task under the same condition . The design ﬁxation degrees and design performance of all par - ticipants were rated by evaluating their solutions according to three evaluation metrics : ﬂuency , ﬂexibility , and the degree of copying . Based on the evaluation results , the participants were divided into the High Fixation Group and Low Fixation Group . Then , the task - related alpha - band activity patterns in diﬀerent brain regions and hemispheres of participants in the two groups and cognitive activities involved in the so - lution creation were analyzed . Using the real - time recording neuroscientiﬁc methodology , it is possible to discover deeper insights into design ﬁxation compared to the typical be - havioral methods used in existing design researches . Fur - thermore , the ﬁndings of the present study will provide essential theoretical supports for the subsequent deﬁxation methods and tools development and , meanwhile , will contribute to the further application and interpretation of EEG technology in future studies on related ﬁelds . The rest of the paper is structured as follows . In Section 2 , we described the experimental setup , the design task , the participants , and the experiment equipment . Besides , so - lution evaluation metrics and analyses , the EEG data ac - quisition and analyses , were also described . Section 3 presented the comparison results between participants with higher and lower ﬁxation in terms of design performance and task - related alpha - band activity patterns , followed by discussions and limitations on the present study in Section 4 . In Section 5 , the ﬁndings of the present study were summarized . 2 . Materials and Methods The main objective of this experiment was to explore the neural activity patterns of participants with diﬀerent degrees of design ﬁxation while generating creative ideas . According to recent researches in this ﬁeld , the occurrence of design ﬁxation during creative idea generation might result from the failure to inhibit the solutions generated relying on intuition ; therefore , we could generally assume that par - ticipants with diﬀerent degrees ( higher vs . lower degree ) of design ﬁxation have diﬀerent brain activity patterns espe - cially alpha - band activity patterns during the creative idea generation process . Details are as follows . 2 . 1 . Participants . A total of 23 mechanical engineering postgraduate students at Sichuan University participated in the experiment . Two participants were excluded from fur - ther analysis because of the missing data due to the excessive impedance , so the ﬁnal sample consisted of 21 participants ( 9 females , aged 22 – 29 years ; M � 26 . 71 years ; SD � 1 . 75 years ) . They all had at least 5 years of engineering experience . All participants were healthy , were right - handed , had normal vision or vision corrected by wearing glasses or contact lenses , and had no reported history of neurological or psychiatric disorders . They all gave written informed con - sent for the EEG experiment . The experiment was carried 2 Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience out following the rules of the human research ethics com - mittee of Sichuan University . And all participants received an honorarium for their participation after the experiment . 2 . 2 . Design Task . The task is to design a device to shell peanuts , and the device should satisfy some requirements : ( 1 ) not destroying peanut kernels , ( 2 ) ability to remove a lot of peanut shells , ( 3 ) easy to manufacture , and ( 4 ) low cost . All participants were provided with the same design re - quirements and the same example solution as shown in Figure 1 , which illustrates one way to ﬁnish this design task . The example solution is derived from a Chinese Patent for Invention ( Published Application Number : CN109288079A ) titled “A peanut shelling device . ” The design task was set up for two reasons : the ﬁrst was that this design task is an engineering design problem that was suitable for all the participants ; the second reason was that none of the participants had been exposed to such a design problem before . 2 . 3 . The Experiment Equipment and Procedure . BrainProductTM actiChamp - 32 Research Ampliﬁer with a sampling rate of 50 kHz and an impedance of 20 k Ω was used to collect EEG data . The EEG signals were recorded by 33 electrodes , and the electrode positions were in line with the international 10 - 20 - system standard . For subsequent statistical analysis of task - related alpha - band activity patterns , electrode positions were aggregated as follows : frontal ( F ) left ( Fp1 , FT9 , F3 , F7 ) right ( Fp2 , FT10 , F4 , F8 ) , frontocentral ( FC ) left ( FC1 , FC5 ) right ( FC2 , FC6 ) , centrotemporal ( CT ) left ( C3 , T7 ) right ( C4 , T8 ) , cen - troparietal ( CP ) left ( CP1 , CP5 ) right ( CP2 , CP6 ) , parie - totemporal ( PT ) left ( P3 , P7 ) right ( P4 , P8 ) , and occipital ( O ) left ( O1 ) right ( O2 ) . The alpha power of each brain region is the mean power of all electrodes in this brain region . For the analysis of potential hemispheric diﬀerences , the midline electrodes ( Fz , Cz , Pz , and Oz ) , ground electrode ( Fpz ) which was placed on the center of the forehead , and ref - erence electrodes ( TP9 , TP10 ) which were , respectively , placed at left and right mastoids were not included in the analysis . The positions of the electrodes are shown in Figure 2 . For each participant , a preexperiment was conducted to let them get familiar with the experimental procedure and experiment equipment and , more importantly , ﬁnd a comfortable position to ﬁnish the design task . The whole procedure of the experiment is shown in Figure 3 . Each experiment started with eyes closed for 20 seconds , which aimed to let the participant calm down , and then with eyes open for 20 seconds during which the EEG signals recorded served as the reference to assess brain activities during the idea generation process . Then , the design task follows . Every participant was explicitly informed of their task in detail at the beginning of the design task . When the participant was sure to understand the design task , the example solution was displayed on the screen . Participants observed the example solution and then attempt to come up with their solutions . When they were sure to have their solutions , they could sketch them . They were required to generate as many solutions as possible and write the design instructions for their sketch solutions . As there is no time limit , the participants can end the design task whenever they thought they ﬁnished it . Then , a brief , ﬁve - minute retro - spective interview was conducted . The whole process of the experiment was videotaped . 2 . 4 . EEG Data Acquisition and Preprocessing . Throughout the experiment , we mainly recorded and analyzed the EEG data during the idea generation period , and the EEG data during the sketching period were not included . EEG data were recorded through BrainVision Recorder and pre - processed through BrainVision Analyzer2 . 1 software ( BrainProduct Inc . ) . The power of EEG is reﬂected by the calculation of the power spectral density ( PSD ) . To eliminate the high - frequency EMG ( Electromyography ) signals generated by the body movements of participants and EOG ( Electrooculogram ) signals produced by eye movements such as blinking , the raw EEG data were ﬁrstly ﬁltered , and the ﬁltering range is 0 . 1 to 40 Hz . Then , the Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) was conducted to remove the ocular artifacts . Finally , the processed EEG data calculated the PSD using a fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) . The power obtained in the experimental reference interval is the reference power , and the power obtained in the idea gen - eration interval is the activation power . For quantifying task - related power ( TRP ) changes in EEG alpha power at electrode i , the ( log - transformed ) power during the reference interval ( Pow i reference ) was subtracted from the ( log - transformed ) power during activation interval ( Pow i activation ) , according to the following formula [ 23 ] : TRP i � log ( Pow i activation ) − log ( Pow i reference ) . When the TRF is positive , it means that the power during the activation interval is increased as compared with that during the reference interval , and the power in - creases are expressed as synchronization . Contrariwise , de - creases in power from the reference to the activation interval are expressed as desynchronization . The TRP changes refer to a situation in which brain activities when performing a Air pump Intake pipe Vent hole Mixing bin Shelled peanut collecting box Crushing rod Unhulled peanuts Figure 1 : The example solution from the paten document ( CN109288079A ) . Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience 3 speciﬁc cognitive task ( in the present study , the creative idea generation ) are associated with the reference interval when performing no task . This can ensure that the diﬀerences in TRP are due to the speciﬁc task rather than baseline brain diﬀerences of individuals’ brains . 2 . 5 . Metrics . An important diﬀerence between design ﬁxation evaluation metrics is whether they are evaluated subjectively ( subjective metrics ) or objectively ( objective metrics ) . The selection of evaluation metrics mainly depends on the study aims , experiment tasks , and hy - potheses . The more subjective metrics are mainly in - clined to the judgment of evaluators , while the relatively objective metrics tend to be directly calculated [ 25 ] . In the present study , the authors mainly focused on the design outcomes ; considering the experimental task conducted , three evaluation metrics ﬂuency , ﬂexibility , and the degree of copying were selected to evaluate all solutions generated per participant . The three metrics all could be explicitly measured , primarily to quantitatively evaluate the design ﬁxation and design performance of each participant : ( 1 ) ﬂuency , a metric to evaluated par - ticipants’ design performance , was measured by count - ing the total number of ideas generated per participant , ( 2 ) ﬂexibility , which was also a metric to evaluated participants’ design performance , was calculated by counting the number of idea categories generated per participant , ( 3 ) the degree of copying , a metric measured design ﬁxation , was evaluated by calculating the per - centage of features from example solutions participants used in their design solutions . In addition , the time the participants spent generating ideas was recorded as an additional metric to evaluate participants’ design per - formance . The two independent evaluators evaluated all solutions generated per participant according to the features listed in Table 1 . Considering the design task in this study , and following the study of Linsey et al . [ 3 ] , the basic features of the example solution in this study were categorized as shown in Table 1 . For subsequent analyses , participants would be classiﬁed into two groups based on the median value of the degree of copying . Those with scores higher than the median value of the degree of copying would be classiﬁed as the High Fixation Group ( G HF ) , while those with scores lower than the median would be classiﬁed as the Low Fixation Group ( G LF ) . It should be noted that using the median of evaluation scores on creativity outputs was commonly used to divided par - ticipants into two groups in related studies [ 22 , 24 , 26 ] . After grouping , separate analyses of the High Fixation Group ( G HF ) and Low Fixation Group ( G LF ) were performed according to each metric .

Statistical Analysis 2 . 6 . 1 . Statistical Analysis of Metrics . The two participants were excluded from further analysis , resulting in the ﬁnal sample that consists of 21 participants . And two independent evaluators rated the solution sketches generated per par - ticipant . To ensure the reliability of evaluations for all metrics , an interevaluator agreement was performed by two independent evaluators , and Pearson’s correlation was used to determine the interevaluator reliability . And to evaluate the design performance of participants with diﬀerent ﬁxa - tion degrees , the one - sample Kolmogorov - Smirnov test was ﬁrst used to verify the normality of the evaluation results of the evaluation metrics . Secondly , Levene’s test was used to check the homogeneity of variance . When the data were normally distributed and the variance was homogeneous , the ANOVA ( Analysis of Variance ) would be carried out . When the data did not match the normal distribution , a Nonparametric Kruskal - Wallis Test was performed to get further analysis . For the analysis of the time the participants with diﬀerent ﬁxation degrees spent generating ideas , an independent sample T - test was conducted . The P value of signiﬁcance level was 0 . 05 , which was the default value of the system . All statistical analyses of solutions were conducted in IBM SPSS statistics package version 24 for Windows . And the results of the evaluators’ agreement on each metric were reported , respectively , hereinafter . 2 . 6 . 2 . Statistical Analysis of Alpha - Band Activity Patterns . The task - related alpha power changes of participants in the two groups ( G LF vs . G HF ) were analyzed . Speciﬁcally , the brain activation regions of participants with diﬀerent ﬁxa - tion degrees were ﬁrst compared . Then , the homogeneity tests were conducted , the sample data obeyed multivariate normal distribution , and , therefore , the repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) was con - ducted to explore the diﬀerences of activity patterns of al - pha - band TRP changes ( synchronization or desynchronization ) , respectively , considering HEMI - SPHERE ( Left vs . Right ) and REGION ( F : frontal , FC : frontocentral , CT : centrotemporal , CP : centroparietal , PT : parietotemporal , O : occipital ) as within - subject factors and FIXATION DEGREE ( G LF vs . G HF ) as a between - subject factor . For the repeated measures MANVOA , to prevent the interference of the sphericity assumption , the Greenhouse - Geisser method was performed to correct the degree of freedom . The P value of signiﬁcance level was 0 . 05 , which was the default value of the system , and the partial eta squared ( ηp 2 ) was used to access the eﬀect size . All the statistical analyses of alpha - band activity patterns were conducted using IBM SPSS statistics package v24 for Windows . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Results of Metrics . Separate evaluations of all solutions generated by the 21 participants were performed for each of the metrics described in the previous section . The higher Pearson’s correlation indicated that the two evaluators gave highly similar scores . Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient be - tween the two evaluators on ﬂuency was signiﬁcantly high ( R � 0 . 97 , P < 0 . 01 ) , which showed that the measurement of ﬂuency was highly reliable . Also , a strong correlation ( Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient , R � 0 . 77 , P < 0 . 01 ) was observed between the two evaluators on the ﬂexibility , which showed that the measurement for this metric was reliable . For the degree of copying , Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient is 0 . 96 ( P < 0 . 01 ) , so the measurement of this metric was re - liable . Table 2 shows the evaluation results of solutions generated by all participants . The analysis of the one - sample Kolmogorov - Smirnov test on design ﬁxation degrees showed that the design ﬁx - ation degrees of participants in this study accorded with a normal distribution ( N � 21 , M � 0 . 41 , SD � 0 . 20 , Z � 0 . 14 , P > 0 . 05 ) . Therefore , for the subsequent analyses of EEG signals of participants with diﬀerent ﬁxation degrees during creative idea generation , we select the median value ( 0 . 41 ) of the degree of copying to group participants into the Low Fixation Group ( N � 12 , M � 0 . 26 ) and the High Fixation Group ( N � 9 , M � 0 . 60 ) . After grouping , separate analyses of the High Fixation Group ( G HF ) and Low Fixation Group ( G LF ) were performed according to each evaluation metric , and the results were shown in Table 3 . The initial results showed that participants in G HF generated a lower number of ideas and idea categories , reused a higher number of features from the example solution , and spent less time generating ideas compared to participants in G LF . Further analyses on the ﬂuency and ﬂexibility of ideas generated by participants with diﬀerent ﬁxation degrees ( G LF vs . G HF ) were also conducted to evaluate participants’ design performance . The variance of ﬂuency data was not homo - geneous , so a Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA was conducted , and the results showed that there was no signiﬁcant correlation between the ﬁxation degrees ( G LF vs . G HF ) and ﬂuency ( H � 0 . 16 , DF � 1 , P > 0 . 05 , N � 21 ) , although participants in G LF generated a few more solutions than those in G HF ( G LF : RM � 11 . 42 ; G HF : RM � 10 . 44 ) . Besides , the variance of ﬂexibility data was not homogeneous either , so another Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA was implemented . The results revealed high correlations of high signiﬁcance between the ﬁxation degrees ( G LF vs . G HF ) and ﬂexibility ( H � 11 . 07 , DF � 1 , P > 0 . 05 , N � 21 ) , and participants in G LF ( RM � 14 . 63 ) demonstrated higher levels of solution ﬂexi - bility compared with participants in G HF ( RM � 6 . 17 ) .

Results of Alpha - Band Activity Patterns . Individually , participants in each group ( G LF vs . G HF ) were contrasted separately against brain activation during creative idea generation . Figure 4 showed alpha - band task - related power ( TRP ) changes in the diﬀerent hemispheres ( L � left hemi - sphere , R � right hemisphere ) and diﬀerent regions ( F : frontal , FC : frontocentral , CT : centrotemporal , CP : cen - troparietal , PT : parietotemporal , O : occipital ) of all partic - ipants in G LF ( N � 12 ) and G HF ( N � 9 ) during creative idea generation . The average processed TRP changes and the PSD topographic distribution of alpha - band in diﬀerent hemi - spheres and regions of participants in G LF ( N � 12 ) and G HF ( N � 9 ) were illustrated in Figure 5 . These data revealed that the alpha - band mainly activated in F ( frontal ) , PT ( parietotemporal ) , and O ( occipital ) re - gions of participants in G LF and was more active in the left hemisphere than in the right one . It was also revealed that the alpha - band mainly activated in PT ( parietotemporal ) and O ( occipital ) regions of participants in G HF and showed a more active state in the right hemisphere than in the left one . Besides , participants in G LF maintained larger alpha - band synchronization , while participants in G HF maintained larger alpha - band desynchronization . To explore alpha - band activity patterns in more detail , further statistical analyses were performed . The repeated measures MANOVA revealed some sig - niﬁcant results on the diﬀerences of activity patterns of alpha - band TRP . ( i ) A signiﬁcant main eﬀect of REGION ( F ( 1 , 19 ) � 14 . 484 , P < 0 . 01 , partial - η 2 � 0 . 433 ) on alpha - band TRP changes was revealed , reﬂected in the larger task - related alpha - band synchronization in the PT ( parietotemporal ) region and O ( occipital ) region . ( ii ) There was no signiﬁcant main eﬀect of HEMISPHERE ( F ( 1 , 19 ) � 0 . 138 , P > 0 . 05 , ηp 2 � 0 . 007 ) on alpha - band TRP changes . ( iii ) A signiﬁcant main eﬀect of FIXATION DEGREE ( F ( 1 , 19 ) � 26 . 745 , P < 0 . 01 , ηp 2 � 0 . 585 ) on alpha - band TRP changes was revealed , with the larger alpha - band synchronization of participants in G LF and the larger alpha - band desynchro - nization of participants in G HF . ( iv ) There were signiﬁcant interactions between FIXATION DEGREE × REGION ( F FIX - ATION DEGREE × REGION ( 1 , 19 ) � 7 . 207 , P < 0 . 05 , ηp 2 � 0 . 277 ) and REGION × HEMISPHERE ( F REGION × HEMISPHERE ( 1 , 19 ) � 4 . 938 , P < 0 . 05 , ηp 2 � 0 . 206 ) , embodied in the larger task - related alpha - band synchronization in the F ( frontal ) , PT ( parietotemporal ) , and O ( occipital ) regions of participants in G LF . In the F ( frontal ) regions , the task - related alpha - band synchronization of the left hemisphere was stronger than that of the right hemisphere . In other brain regions , the opposite was shown ; that is , the task - related alpha - band synchroniza - tion was stronger in the right hemisphere over these brain regions than in the left one . In G HF , the larger task - related alpha - band desynchronization was stronger in the right hemisphere over F ( frontal ) , CP ( centroparietal ) , and PT ( parietotemporal ) regions of participants in G HF . However , no signiﬁcant interaction between FIXATION DEGREE and HEMISPHERE ( F FIXATION DEGREE × HEMI - SPHERE ( 1 , 19 ) � 4 . 093 , P > 0 . 05 , ηp 2 � 0 . 177 ) on alpha - band TRP changes was found . ( v ) Signiﬁcant interactions between REGION × HEMISPHERE × FIXATION DE - GREE ( ( F REGION × HEMISPHERE × FIXATION DEGREE ( 5 , 95 ) � 4 . 490 , P < 0 . 05 , ηp 2 � 0 . 191 ) were found on alpha - band TRP changes . ( vi ) The interactions of REGION × HEMISPHERE were signiﬁcant on TRP changes of participants in G LF ( F ( 1 , 11 ) � 6 . 922 , P < 0 . 05 , ηp 2 � 0 . 386 ) , but no further signiﬁcant interactions of REGION × HEMISPHERE were found on TRP changes of participants in G HF ( F ( 1 , 8 ) � 0 . 258 , P > 0 . 05 , ηp 2 � 0 . 031 ) . And in G LF , i larger alpha synchronization was found in the right hemisphere than in the left ( Left : M � 0 . 067 , SE � 0 . 016 ; Right : M � 0 . 080 , SE � 0 . 017 ) . 4 . Discussion The present study aimed to explore the neural activities involved in diﬀerent degrees of design ﬁxation during creative idea generation . Given the consistent ﬁndings of neuroscience studies on creativity , we focused on task - re - lated power changes in the alpha - band . Therefore , an EEG experiment was conducted to explore the task - related alpha - band activity patterns in diﬀerent hemispheres and regions of participants with high and low ﬁxation degrees during creative idea generation . The participants were required to generate as many solutions as possible to ﬁnish the design task and they were provided with the same example solution . Fluency , ﬂexibility , and degree of copying were used to evaluate the design performance and ﬁxation degrees of solutions generated per participant . Besides , the time par - ticipants spent generating ideas was also analyzed to evaluate participants’ design performance . And the alpha - band ac - tivities of every participant during idea generation were recorded and analyzed . The solution evaluation results revealed no signiﬁcant relationship between the ﬁxation degrees and ﬂuency . In general , an increase in idea ﬂuency is usually considered Table 2 : The evaluation results of solutions generated by all participants ( N � 21 ) .

Nonetheless , in the present study , no signiﬁcant correlations between ﬂuency and the ﬁxation degrees were found , and this might indicate that the lower level of ﬂuency – 0 . 4 – 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 F FC CT CP PT O T R P Region L - participant 2 R - participant 2 L - participant 4 R - participant 4 L - participant 5 R - participant 5 L - participant 8 R - participant 8 L - participant 9 R - participant 9 L - participant 11 R - participant 11 L - participant 12 R - participant 12 L - participant 13 R - participant 13 L - participant 14 R - participant 14 L - participant 16 R - participant 16 L - participant 18 R - participant 18 L - participant 21 R - participant 21 ( a ) – 0 . 6 – 0 . 5 – 0 . 4 – 0 . 3 – 0 . 2 – 0 . 1 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 F FC CT CP PT O T R P Region L - participant 1 R - participant 1 L - participant 3 R - participant 3 L - participant 6 R - participant 6 L - participant 7 R - participant 7 L - participant 10 R - participant 10 L - participant 15 R - participant 15 L - participant 17 R - participant 17 L - participant 19 R - participant 19 L - participant 20 R - participant 20 ( b ) Figure 4 : The alpha - band TRP changes in diﬀerent hemispheres and regions of all participants in G LF ( Above , N � 12 ) and G HF ( Below , N � 9 ) . Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience 7 might not be a typical characteristic of design ﬁxation . At the same time , no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found in time spent generating ideas between participants with diﬀerent ﬁxation degrees ; this is consistent with the results from the study of Neroni and Crilly [ 30 ] . One possible explanation is that during the whole process of idea generation , diﬀerent participants have diﬀerent focuses and design patterns . Further researches concerning the design process and design ﬁxation are needed to verify this argument . Critically , we observed a high correlation of great sig - niﬁcance between idea ﬂexibility and design ﬁxation degree . This ﬁnding was consistent with most design ﬁxation studies where design ﬁxation was mainly manifested in the decrease of solution categories [ 1 – 4 , 6 , 9 , 10 ] . Flexibility reﬂected the ability to switch between diverse ﬁelds to explore alternative solutions . That the participants in G HF demonstrated lower ﬂexibility could be well understood because they conducted a limited exploration of solution space due to the overreliance on the given example solution without consideration of other alternative solutions . Given the important role of inhibitory control in the generation of creative ideas [ 19 , 24 , 31 , 32 ] , this result can be further explained as follows : participants with higher degrees of design ﬁxation uncon - sciously followed the path of least resistance during creative idea generation , reﬂected in the inhibitory control function of System 2 failed to work ; as a result , more solutions with higher degrees of copying generated intuitively in System 1 were revealed . Of course , following the path of least resis - tance , and generating solutions by searching for the given , established solutions would be far easier and required less cognitive eﬀort [ 33 , 34 ] . Participants with lower degrees of design ﬁxation were able to stray far from the path of least resistance , and the inhibitory control function of System 2 worked to inhibit the intuitive , common , and higher - level copying solutions generated in System 1 . Critically , these claims can be proved by electrophysiological results in the present study . Consistent with the ﬁndings of previous neural ﬁndings [ 19 , 24 , 35 ] , the electrophysiological results in the present study revealed that task - related alpha - band activity patterns were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in participants with diﬀerent degrees of design ﬁxation during creative idea generation . We found that participants with lower ﬁxation degrees demonstrated task - related alpha synchronization in frontal , parietotemporal , and occipital regions , and critically , the right hemisphere showed larger alpha - band synchronization during ideation . While participants with higher degrees of design ﬁxation showed stronger task - related alpha desynchronization in frontal , centroparietal , and parieto - temporal regions . Speciﬁcally , the right hemisphere dis - played larger alpha - band desynchronization . Given that the frontal alpha synchronization reﬂects the function of in - hibitory control of task - irrelevant areas [ 36 ] and the obvious ideas generated relying on intuition [ 26 , 37 ] , our results provided additional support for the role of the inhibitory control in creative idea generation . Besides , the parietal and occipital alpha synchronizations reﬂect the shielding mechanism that prevents interference from unrelated ex - ternal stimulus and supports internally directed attention [ 23 , 32 , 38 ] ; our results further revealed that , in addition to the inhibitory control , the participant with a lower ﬁxation degree also maintained a high degree of internally directed attention . To sum up , our results conﬁrmed that design ﬁxation occurrence was closely related to the inability to inhibit the solutions generated relying on intuition during creative idea generation and proved that inhibitory control was the core process of idea generation to generate creative solutions . Besides , it should be noted that alpha synchronization is also closely associated with divergent thinking [ 23 , 26 , 37 , 39 ] PSD topographic distribution of alpha - band in G LF PSD topographic distribution of alpha - band in G HF 0 . 79 µ V 2 / Hz 0 µ V 2 / Hz – 0 . 79 µ V 2 / Hz 1 . 31 µ V 2 / Hz 0 µ V 2 / Hz – 1 . 31 µ V 2 / Hz 0 . 25 0 . 2 0 . 15 0 . 1 0 . 05 – 0 . 05 T R P – 0 . 15 – 0 . 25 Region F FC CT CP PT O – 0 . 2 – 0 . 1 0 L - G LF R - G LF L - G HF R - G HF Figure 5 : The PSD topographic distribution and alpha - band TRP changes after the average processing of sample data . 8 Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience which usually refers to the thinking process of generating original ideas by exploring various possible solutions . Consequently , our results could further explain why the participant with a higher ﬁxation degree demonstrated lower solution ﬂexibility because the higher ﬁxation restricted their divergent thinking . Therefore , the occurrence of high - level design ﬁxation may be more reﬂected in the ﬂexibility rather than ﬂuency of the generated solutions . Note , however , that generating a creative idea is a complex activity that covers many cognitive activities . Therefore , we assume that the generation of creative ideas involving the inhibitory control on the ﬁxation eﬀect may not simply require activities in certain brain regions or a hemisphere but also requires the activities of networks of multiple regions of the brain . Future studies in this ﬁeld are thus particularly challenged to ex - plore how the networks of multiple regions aﬀect the generation of creative ideas involving inhibitory control on the ﬁxation eﬀect . Nevertheless , the current study also has some limitations that should be acknowledged . Firstly , it should be ac - knowledged that the ideal setup of this experiment is to add a control group where participants would be provided with no example solution ; this is thought to be more scientiﬁc . However , in the very early stage of our research , several experiments were carried out without an example solution , the results showed that most of the participants were at a loss facing such a design task without any hints . They exhausted their eﬀort to comprehend the design task , but ﬁnally , almost none of them generated any ideas . Therefore , we removed the control group where no example solution was provided to participants , but this might aﬀect the comparison results , future studies in this ﬁeld need to set up a control group , which would be more scientiﬁc . Secondly , the EEG signals during sketching were not included in the present study . However , there would be considerable diﬀerences in alpha - band activity patterns of participants with diﬀerent ﬁxation degrees between the idea generation period and sketching period . We will explore this assumption in our future work related to the design process . Thirdly , the results obtained in the present study were under laboratory conditions ; in real - world design activities , diﬀerent ﬁndings might be observed . Therefore , further studies are needed to verify whether the ﬁndings observed in the laboratory can be generalized to real - world design activities . Finally , the diﬀerences in the experience and the knowledge level of participants in our study were not carefully considered ; however , both would aﬀect the experiment results . These factors should be con - sidered in future researches to address the limitations of the present study . 5 . Conclusions The present study utilized EEG to explore neural activity patterns of designers with higher and lower ﬁxation during creative idea generation and aimed to ﬁnd some neural basics of design ﬁxation . Given the consistent ﬁndings of neuroscience studies on creativity , the present study espe - cially focused on task - related alpha - band power changes of participants with diﬀerent degrees of design ﬁxation during creative idea generation . The electrophysiological results showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in participants with higher and lower ﬁxation and proved that the occurrence of high - level design ﬁxation , when faced with an example solution , reﬂected the inability to inhibit the solutions generated overrelying on intuition . Besides , the observed task - related changes of alpha power in the process of ideation revealed that design ﬁxation may also associate with the defocused internal attention and the restricted divergent thinking . These results could contribute to a deeper understanding of design ﬁxation from the neuroscience perspective , revealing the diﬀerent neural activities involved in the occurrence of higher and lower degrees of design ﬁxation . Moreover , the ﬁndings provide essential theoretical supports for the sub - sequent deﬁxation methods and tool development and , meanwhile , will contribute to the further application and interpretation of EEG technology in future studies on related ﬁelds .
