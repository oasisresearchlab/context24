EGFR signalling is critical dur - ing embryogenesis , in particular in epithelial development , and disruption of the EGFR gene results in epithelial immaturity and perinatal death . EGFR signalling also functions during wound healing responses through accelerating wound re - epithelialisation , inducing cell migration , proliferation and angiogene - sis . Upregulation of EGFR signalling is often observed in carcinomas and has been shown to promote uncontrolled cell proliferation and metastasis . Therefore aberrant EGFR signalling is a common target for anticancer therapies . Various reports indicate that EGFR signalling primarily occurs at the plasma mem - brane and EGFR degradation following endocytosis greatly attenuates signalling .

Introduction Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) was ﬁrst discovered in 1962 by Stanley Cohen ( Cohen , 1962 ) . It was isolated from mouse sali - vary glands and identiﬁed to promote development of incisors and eyelids . Further observation that EGF binds in a speciﬁc manner to cell membranes led to the identiﬁcation of the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) in the mid - 1970 ( Okeefe et al , 1974 ; Carpenter et al . , 1975 ) . Beginning with these discoveries , functions of EGFR signalling have been extensively studied and multiple signalling cascades activated downstream of EGFR have been characterised . These studies have led to the identiﬁcation of critical roles of EGFR signalling network in embryogenesis , angiogenesis and cancer development ( Yewale et al . , 2013 ; Zeng and Harris , in press ) . EGFR ( ErbB1 ) belongs to the family of ErbB receptors , which also comprises ErbB2 , ErbB3 and ErbB4 . They consist of the extracellular domain , single transmembrane domain and the intracellular domain . ErbB2 is unique among other ErbB receptors because its extracellular domain does not bind any known ErbB receptor ligand ( Klapper et al . , 1999 ) and thus ErbB2 receptors do not homodimerise in physiological conditions ; further structural studies also revealed that ErbB2 is in an active conformation in an unbound state ( Garrett et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast , ErbB3 is capable of ligand binding , but displays weak tyrosine kinase activity ( Shi http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . biocel . 2014 . 03 . 014 1357 - 2725 / © 2014 Elsevier Ltd . All rights reserved . 24 S . Jones , J . Z . Rappoport / The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology 51 ( 2014 ) 23 – 28 et al . , 2010 ) . In addition to the membrane - bound receptors , soluble forms also exist , which lack the transmembrane and intracellular domains . These soluble receptors are generated either via alter - native mRNA splicing or through proteolytic cleavage of the cell surface receptors , known as ectodomain shedding . In the case of EGFR , soluble isoforms have been found to be generated by both pathways and have a potential to become useful as diagnostic and / or prognostic cancer biomarkers ( Adamczyk et al . , 2011 ; Maramotti et al . , 2012 ; Wilken et al . , 2013 ) . Following stimulation with a ligand , ErbB receptors at the plasma membrane can homo - or heterodimerise , a property that depends on the nature of the ligand and on the complement of receptors expressed by a particular cell type ( Tzahar et al . , 1996 ; Olayioye et al . , 2000 ) . Heterodimerisation brings additional diversity to signalling properties ; additionally , heterodimers may acquire new signalling characteristics , which do not necessarily simply reﬂect the sum of properties of the two monomers ( Olayioye et al . , 2000 ) . Several EGFR ligands have been described , which include EGF , heparin - binding ( HB ) - EGF , transforming growth factor (cid:2) ( TGF - (cid:2) ) , amphiregulin , betacellulin , epiregulin and epigen ( Schneider and Wolf , 2009 ) . Each of these ligands may regulate EGFR signalling and trafﬁcking in different manners . For example , stimulation of human laryngeal epithelial carcinoma cells Hep - 2 with HB - EGF or betacellulin triggered persistent EGFR phosphorylation and ubiqui - tylation , and ultimately degradation ; in contrast , stimulation with TGF - (cid:2) resulted in only subtle EGFR phosphorylation and ubiquity - lation , and complete EGFR recycling ( Roepstorff et al . , 2009 ) . The effect of TGF - (cid:2) may be explained by high pH sensitivity of the TGF - (cid:2) - EGFR binding , which causes dissociation of TGF - (cid:2) within acidic endosomes , leading to recycling of unbound EGFR ; accordingly the binding between EGFR and betacellulin is highly acid - resistant and thus is preserved within the acidic environment of endosomes . Betacellulin also promotes persistent recruitment of Cbl ubiqui - tin ligase and strong EGFR ubiquitylation . The effects of some of the ligands have yet to be explained . For example HB - EGF causes only transient Cbl recruitment ( Roepstorff et al . , 2009 ) . A recent study also found that knockdown of clathrin , a protein involved in EGFR endocytosis , completely inhibited EGFR internalisation fol - lowing stimulation with EGF , but only partially with HB - EGF and betacellulin , raising the possibility that the type of the ligand may dictate the entry route of EGFR ( Henriksen et al . , 2013 ) . Because elevated levels of EGFR ligands are associated with tumour growth and can be upregulated in cancer ( Derynck et al . , 1987 ; Schneider and Wolf , 2009 ; Vlaicu et al . , 2013 ) , these differences have potential signiﬁcant implications for cancer progression . Current understanding suggests that decreased EGFR degrada - tion and / or increased recycling prolong activation of downstream signalling cascades ( Tomas et al . , 2014 ) ; therefore , it is likely that the governing of EGFR trafﬁcking by ligand type , concentration and duration of stimulation may have major consequences for signalling outcomes . Indeed , studies employing a range of con - centrations of EGF have shown that both EGFR signalling and trafﬁcking largely depend on ligand concentration ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 , 2008 ) . In particular at higher ligand concentra - tions ( 20 ng / ml ) , EGFR became ubiquitylated and internalised via clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) , whereas at lower concen - trations ( 1 – 2 ng / ml ) EGFR was not ubiquitylated and internalised via CME ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore it was proposed that following CME , EGFR is preferentially recycled and thus down - stream signalling is prolonged ; in contrast following CIE , EGFR trafﬁcking is shifted towards canonical lysosomal degradation , or potentially non - canonical degradation ( Jones et al . , 2014 ) , lead - ing to signal attenuation ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) . From these ( and other ) studies an interesting pattern of concentration - dependent consequences not only for EGFR trafﬁcking , but also for signal transduction has emerged ; however , little is known about the func - tions of ligands other than EGF in this context . It may be proposed that unique signalling and trafﬁcking patterns could be attributed to EGFR activation following stimulation with a particular lig - and . As mentioned above , ligand binding leads to EGFR dimeriza - tion and activation of intracellular tyrosine kinase domains . The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of EGFR bound to TGF - (cid:2) in a 2 : 2 complex revealed that each ligand binds only one EGFR molecule , and that dimerization is mediated by the recep - tors themselves ( Garrett et al . , 2002 ) . Following ligand binding , the EGFR kinase domains form an asymmetric dimer and undergo activation by an allosteric mechanism . In this model , the C - lobe of one kinase domain ( ‘ activator ’ ) interacts with and activates the N - lobe of the other ( ‘ receiver ’ ) leading to activation of the kinase domain of the ‘ receiver ’ , which in turn phosphorylates tyrosine residues within its C - terminus . The ‘ receiver’ then becomes an ‘ activator ’ and so both EGFR molecules within a dimer become activated ( Zhang et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast to the majority of cell sur - face receptors ( Hubbard , 2004 ) , EGFR activation does not require trans - phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residue within the activation loop , as its mutation was shown not to inhibit EGFR activation on the surface of lipid vesicles ( Zhang et al . , 2006 ) . Following ligand stimulation , EGFR activates multiple signalling cascades , ultimately promoting cell proliferation , migration and anti - apoptotic activities ( Schneider and Wolf , 2009 ; Yewale et al . , 2013 ; Zeng and Harris , in press ) . Simultaneously EGFR is inter - nalised through clathrin - dependent and independent mechanisms ( Huang et al . , 2004 ; Sigismund et al . , 2008 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ; Goh et al . , 2010 ; Henriksen et al . , 2013 ) . Numer - ous reports indicate that receptor endocytosis and trafﬁcking through the endocytic system regulate signalling output , and vice versa , signalling downstream of activated EGFR controls its trafﬁcking . This review highlights the current understand - ing of an intersection between EGFR signalling and trafﬁck - ing . 2 . Functions of signalling in trafﬁcking and vice versa EGFR signalling downstream of activated EGFR largely regu - lates cell fate through activation of multiple signalling pathways ( Schneider and Wolf , 2009 ; Yewale et al . , 2013 ; Zeng and Harris , in press ) . At the same time ligand - bound EGFR undergoes reg - ulated endocytosis from the cell surface followed by trafﬁcking through the endocytic system ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ; Roepstorff et al . , 2009 ) . Multiple lines of evidence reveal that EGFR signalling is governed by receptor compartmen - talisation , and that EGFR trafﬁcking through the endocytic system relies on signalling outcomes . Several examples of this interde - pendent modulation of EGFR signalling and trafﬁcking are shown in Fig . 1 . 2 . 1 . Regulation of EGFR signalling by endocytic trafﬁcking Although EGFR endocytosis was originally perceived solely as a signal attenuator ( Carpenter and Cohen , 1979 ) , isolation of EGF along with activated EGFR from intracellular vesicles of squamous carcinoma cells shed light on the possible importance of endocytic trafﬁcking for signal propagation ( Cohen and Fava , 1985 ) . Following on from this , various approaches have been undertaken to inhibit endocytosis and study the consequences of its inhibition for EGFR signalling . One of the ﬁrst reports on the potential function of endocyto - sis in EGFR signalling comes from a study of a dominant - negative S . Jones , J . Z .

An intersection between EGFR signalling and trafﬁcking . Proteins activated via EGFR at the plasma membrane and within endosomes are shown in green , and signalling events required for EGFR endocytosis and sorting are shown in purple . The cascades proposed to originate at the plasma membrane include PLC (cid:3) pathway , MAPK / Erk pathway and PI3K / Akt pathway . The cascades suggested to be activated following EGFR internalisation include MAPK / Erk pathway , PI3K / Akt pathway , and engagement of ESCRT machinery . form of dynamin , a protein required for CME and certain types of CIE . A decrease in EGF - mediated endocytosis following conditional expression of this mutant resulted in increased phosphoryla - tion of phospholipase C (cid:3) ( PLC (cid:3) ) and Shc ( Src homology 2 domain - containing adaptor protein ) , but downregulation of EGFR , extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( Erk ) and phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) ( subunit p85 ) phosphorylation ( Vieira et al . , 1996 ) . Inhibition of CME by knockdown of clathrin or adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) subunits also resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Erk and Akt ( protein kinase B ) , but not Shc , upon EGF stimula - tion ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) . Conversely , a recent study using dynamin - depleted ﬁbroblasts found that inhibition of endocytosis did not affect phosphorylation of Erk and Akt following EGF stimu - lation , but phosphorylation of both EGFR and Shc ( isoform 66 ) was enhanced ( Sousa et al . , 2012 ) . Quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of changes in pro - tein phosphorylation upon EGF treatment , employing the dynamin inhibitor Dynasore , further showed that phosphorylation of EGFR , PLC (cid:3) , several mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) and many other proteins was not affected by inhibition of endocytosis ( Omerovic et al . , 2012 ) ; however , it was also noted that phos - phorylation of hepatocyte growth factor - regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ( Hrs ) and other components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRT ) machinery , e . g . signal transducing adaptor molecule ( STAM ) , was greatly reduced follow - ing Dynasore treatment . 2 . 2 . Regulation of EGFR trafﬁcking by signalling In addition to the regulation of signalling by EGFR compartmen - talisation , EGFR endocytosis and trafﬁcking through the endocytic system also require certain signalling events to occur . For example , EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr998 and Ser991 following EGF stim - ulation has been proposed to be critical for EGFR internalisation , as mutations of either of these residues inhibited ligand - mediated EGFR endocytosis ( Tong et al . , 2009 ) . AP2 , required for EGFR endo - cytosis ( Huang et al . , 2004 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ; Goh et al . , 2010 ) , has also been found to bind phosphorylated EGFR with much higher afﬁnity than non - phosphorylated EGFR ( Nesterov et al . , 1995 ) . EGFR phosphorylation may therefore also contribute to EGFR endocytosis through enhanced association with AP2 . Another study found that phosphorylation of EGFR substrate 15 ( Eps15 ) is essen - tial for EGF - mediated internalisation of EGFR , because expression of a mutant Eps15 defective in phosphorylation inhibited EGFR endocytosis ( Confalonieri et al . , 2000 ) . In addition to phosphorylation , a potential role of ubiquitylation in EGFR endocytosis has been widely investigated . A recent study using a mass - spectrometric approach found that upon EGF stim - ulation , EGFR was predominantly either polyubiquitylated , with short ubiquitin chains linked via Lys63 within the ubiquitin moi - ety , or single monoubiquitylated ( Huang et al . , 2013 ) . As mentioned above , the level of EGFR ubiquitylation has been shown to depend on ligand concentration : at low EGF concentrations , EGFR has been 26 S . Jones , J . Z . Rappoport / The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology 51 ( 2014 ) 23 – 28 shown to be poorly ubiquitylated and internalised primarily via CME , whereas at higher concentrations , substantial ubiquitylation of EGFR was observed and EGFR was internalised via clathrin - dependent and independent pathways ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) ( although these observations may be cell line / type speciﬁc ) . These data therefore suggest that ubiquitylation may be dispensable for CME , but essential for CIE of EGFR ; however , mutations of several lysine residues within the kinase domain of EGFR ( 15KR mutant : 14KR with an additional K684R mutation ) resulted in negligible EGFR ubiquitylation , yet did not affect EGF - stimulated EGFR endo - cytosis ( Huang et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , it was noted that in the case of an EGFR mutant with impaired kinase activity ( 14KR with additional K704 / 799R mutations ) , which was poorly ubiquitylated and defective in internalisation , restoring partial ubiquitylation rescued EGFR endocytosis ( Huang et al . , 2007 ) . Further mutations of several lysine residues within the C - terminal portion of the 15KR EGFR mutant also inhibited its endocytosis following EGF stimulation , and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that these C - terminal lysines are acetylated ( Goh et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast to its vague function during endocytosis , EGFR ubiq - uitylation has been shown to be essential for targeting EGFR for lysosomal degradation . A recent study found that degradation of the poorly - ubiquitylated EGFR mutant ( 15 KR mutant ) was reduced and its recycling was enhanced following EGF treatment . Further analysis revealed that this mutant is defective in binding Hrs , a member of the ESCRT machinery , and in promoting EGF - stimulated formation of intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) within late endosomes ( Eden et al . , 2012 ) . In summary , from the data presented an interesting image emerges , in which certain signalling cascades may originate at the plasma membrane , whereas others may be potentiated following EGFR internalisation . At the same time , multiple events of phos - phorylation and ubiquitylation in response to ligand binding would modulate EGFR trafﬁcking . 3 . Cascades As portrayed above , ligand stimulation promotes activation of multiple cascades downstream of EGFR , examples of which are shown in Fig . 2 . Each of these downstream pathways is inherently complex and detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this review , as such recent dedicated reviews are suggested for the reader . 3 . 1 . MAPK / Erk pathway One of the major pathways activated downstream of EGFR is the MAPK / Erk pathway . In this pathway , activated EGFR asso - ciates with growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 ( Grb2 ) directly or through Shc ( Batzer et al . , 1994 ) . Recruitment of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos to the EGFR - Shc - Grb2 complex leads to activation of Ras and downstream Raf / MEK / Erk cascade ( Jiang and Sorkin , 2002 ; Wan et al . , 2004 ) . To gain more insight into this pathway please refer to Mendoza et al . ( 2011 ) . 3 . 2 . PI3 - K / Akt pathway EGFR - mediated activation of the PI3K / Akt anti - apoptotic path - way involves phosphorylation of Grb2 - associated binder - 1 ( GAB1 ) by EGFR , which in turn promotes recruitment of PI3K and activa - tion of the PI3K / Akt signalling cascade ( Rodrigues et al . , 2000 ) . Also see Mendoza et al . ( 2011 ) for more information on the PI3K / Akt pathway . 3 . 3 . PLC (cid:2) pathway EGFR activation also controls calcium signalling ( Margolis et al . , 1989 ) . Following ligand stimulation , EGFR interacts with and phos - phorylates PLC (cid:3) , which in turn hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - biphosphate ( PIP2 ) to diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol triphos - phate ( IP 3 ) . Finally , DAG activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) and IP3 mediates release of intracellular calcium . Please refer to Park et al . ( 2012 ) to gain more insight into phospholipase signalling . 3 . 4 . Other pathways and interactors Other proteins associated with EGFR include , but are not con - tained to , Src , which promotes cell migration through activation of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) ( Biscardi et al . , 1999 ; Ray et al . , 2012 ) , as well as through phosphorylation of caveolin 1 ( Cav1 ) , which recruits growth factor receptor - bound protein 7 ( Grb7 ) ( Lee et al . , 2000 ) . EGFR also interacts and phosphorylates STAT ( signal trans - ducer and activator of transcription ) proteins , which modulate gene expression ( Olayioye et al . , 1999 ) , and an interaction between EGFR and Cbl has been identiﬁed to be required for EGFR ubiquitylation and lysosomal degradation ( Grovdal et al . , 2004 ) . 4 . Key molecules in current therapies Due to the vast number and high complexity of the processes activated downstream of EGFR , the accurate regulation of EGFR signalling is vital for cellular homeostasis . Upregulation of EGFR signalling is associated with various pathologies and different approaches are being developed to inhibit aberrant EGFR signalling . Among others , these include monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) which bind EGFR extracellular domain and compete with ligand binding , and tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) directed against EGFR kinase domain , both of which are commonly used in anticancer therapies . 4 . 1 . Monoclonal antibodies When nude mice injected with human cancer cells were treated with anti - EGFR MAbs , which were derived from mice immunised with EGFR , the growth of some tumours was inhibited ( Masui et al . , 1984 ) . Following from this discovery , many anti - EGFR MAbs have been developed , and two are currently used in treatment of cancer . The ﬁrst one is a chimeric mouse - human MAb cetuximab ( Erbitux ) , which has been used since 2004 ( USA ) for treatment of EGFR - expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma , and since 2011 ( USA ) for treatment of metastatic head and neck cancer . Likewise , the sec - ond MAb panitumumab ( Vectibix ) , which is fully human , has been in clinic since 2006 ( USA ) for the treatment of EGFR - expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma ( Fig . 2 ) . For further information on these and others monoclonal antibodies in anticancer therapies the reader is advised to refer to Scott et al . ( 2012 ) . 4 . 2 . EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors The ﬁrst reports on the function of EGFR TKIs in inhibiting cell proliferation showed that the drugs tested speciﬁcally inhibit EGFR and not insulin receptor activity . These inhibitors were patterned after erbstatin and were derivatives of benzylidene malononitrile ( Yaish et al . , 1988 ) . The drugs competed with the substrate for binding to EGFR tyrosine kinase domain leading to inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation and EGF - dependent proliferation of squa - mous carcinoma cells . Since then , further EGFR TKIs have been developed , and four are currently used in treatment of non - small cell lung cancer : reversible TKIs geﬁtinib ( Iressa ) since 2003 ( USA ) , erlotinib ( Tarceva ) since 2004 ( USA ) , icotinib ( Conmana ) since 2011 ( China ) and an irreversible TKI afatinib ( Gilotrif ) since 2013 ( USA ) S .

EGFR signalling pathway . Upon ligand binding , EGFR activates multiple signalling pathways , leading to cell proliferation , differentiation , migration and survival . Anti - EGFR monoclonal antibodies ( cetuximab , panitumumab ) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( geﬁtinib , erlotinib , icotinib , afatinib ) currently used in anticancer therapies block EGFR signalling . ( Fig . 2 ) . Please refer to Ohashi et al . ( 2013 ) for more information regarding EGFR inhibitors used in clinics . 4 . 3 . Potential for combination of drugs Besides monotherapy with MAbs and small molecule TKIs , a combination of EGFR inhibitors with drugs targeting other pro - teins , in particular those downstream of EGFR , has been proposed . For example , a somatic mutation within Ack1 ( activated Cdc42 - associated kinase 1 ) , a protein involved in EGFR signalling and trafﬁcking , enhanced cell proliferation and migration , and silenc - ing of this mutant form of Ack1 sensitised renal cancer cells to treatment with EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib ( Chua et al . , 2010 ) . Another study showed that incubation of squamous carcinoma cells with both EGFR TKI erlotinib and insulin - like growth factor 1 recep - tor inhibitor decreased proliferation of squamous cell carcinoma cells as well as Akt and MAPK / Erk signalling more effectively than erlotinib on its own ( Clayburgh et al . , 2013 ) . 4 . 4 . Resistance to inhibitors of EGFR signalling Even though anti - EGFR therapies may be beneﬁcial , many cancer patients who initially respond to the inhibition of EGFR signalling will ultimately develop resistance . This can happen through several different mechanisms , examples include muta - tions within pro - apoptotic genes which regulate TKI - induced apoptosis ( Ng et al . , 2012 ) and a point mutation within the EGFR kinase domain ( T790M ) , as well as activation of alternative signalling pathways , e . g . through ampliﬁcation of ErbB2 , or through small cell transformation ( Yu et al . , 2013 ) . Further studies into the mechanisms of the acquired resistance will help overcome this problem and improve the therapies for treatment of cancers which depend on EGFR signalling . For more insight into the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors the reader is advised to refer to Remon et al . ( 2014 ) . 5 . Conclusions and future perspectives The emerging intersection between EGFR signalling and traf - ﬁcking has great potential to be useful in clinics , because it appears that the cell - type speciﬁc complement of ErbB receptors and lig - ands may differently regulate cell fate . The type of the ligand along with ligand concentration and duration of stimulation is likely to dictate the speciﬁc signalling and trafﬁcking outcomes for EGFR . This particularly has been shown in the case of EGF , in which con - centration may determine the routes of EGFR entry into the cell , which in turn may inﬂuence signalling responses ( Sigismund et al . , 2005 , 2008 ) . Little is known , however , about the functions of the remaining ligands in this context ( Roepstorff et al . , 2009 ; Henriksen et al . , 2013 ) . Because cancer cells may potentially acquire a unique set of ErbB receptors and ligands , further investigation into this topic will likely enable the understanding of diverse signalling and trafﬁcking patterns speciﬁc for cancer cells .
