The sample of this study consisted of 51 11th grade students from two different classes . While one of the classes was the experimental group where analo - gy was used in the lessons , the other class was the control group where the traditional methods are employed in lessons and this selection was made randomly . When the obtained results were examined , it was seen that teach - ing with analogy has a significantly positive effect on the elimination of misconception and achievement although it has almost no effect on the attitudes of towards physics . Key Words : analogy , teaching , physics education , students , achievement Simply stated , an analogy is a process of identifying similarities between two concepts . The fa - miliar concept is called the analog and the unfamiliar science concept is called the target ( Glynn , 1991 ) , Many models have been presented regarding analogy by Brown and Clement ( 1989 ) , bridging analo - gies , Dupin and Joshua ( 1989 ) , the analogy teaching model , Glynn ( 1991 ) Teaching - With - Analogy ( TWA ) and Zeitoun ( 1984 ) the general model of analogy teaching . When using an analogy in the teach - ing of science , teachers should select an appropriate student world analog to assist in explaining the science concept . The analog and target share attributes that allow a relationship to be identified and contribute to the concept being taught ; however , there are features of the analogy that are unlike the target , and these can cause impaired learning if incorrectly matched . Consequently , the use of analogies in the teaching of science does not always produce the intended effects , especially when students take the analogy too far and are unable to separate it from the content being learned . Some students only remember the analogy and not the content under study , while others focus on extraneous aspects of the analogy and draw spurious conclusions about the target concept . Analogies are believed to aid student learning by providing visualisation of abstract concepts , by helping compare similarities of the students’ real world with the new concepts , and by increasing stu - dents’ motivation ( Duit , 1991 ) . Concrete analogs facilitate understanding of the abstract concept by pointing to similarities between objects or events in the students’ world and the phenomenon under discussion . Analogies can be motivational in that , as the teacher uses ideas from the students’ real world experience , a sense of intrinsic interest is generated . From a teaching perspective , the use of analogies can enhance conceptual change learning of science as they open new perspectives ( Thiele and Treagust , 1995 ; Treagust et . al . , 1996 ; Chiu and Lin , 2002 ; Dilber and Düzgün , 2008 ) Despite their advantages and usefulness , analogies can cause incorrect or impaired learning , de - pending on the analog - target relationship . For example , if the analog is unfamiliar to the learner , devel - opment of systematic understanding is precluded . Although analogies may be more useful to students who primarily function at the concrete operational level ( Gabel and Sherwood , 1980 ) , if students lack EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH Vol . 1 , No . 3 , 211 - 223 ISSN 2165 - 8714 Copyright © 2012 EU - JER http : / / www . eu - jer . com DOI : 10 . 12973 / eu - jer . 1 . 3 . 211 212 Ugur et al . © 2012 , European Journal of Educational Research , 1 ( 3 ) , 211 - 223 visual imagery analogical reasoning may be limited . Students already functioning at a formal opera - tional level may have an adequate understanding of the target and the inclusion of an analogy might add unnecessary information or noise ( Johnstone and Al - Naeme , 1991 ) . For these reasons , some teachers choose not to use analogies at all and thereby avoid these problems while , at the same time , forsaking the advantages of analogy use . Unshared attributes between the analog and target are often a cause of misunderstanding for learners who attempt to transfer or map unshared attributes from the analog to the target . No analog shares all its attributes with the target , or , by definition , it would become an example ; therefore , every analog breaks down somewhere . For instance , when electric currents in wires are compared to water flowing in pipes , some students conclude that electricity will leak out of a switched - on power point that has no plug in it . Indeed , some students try to transfer most or all of the analog structure into the target content and then describe the target content with direct reference to analog features . Other students may only remember the analogy and not the content under study . Nevertheless , a significant body of re - search suggests that although analogies are commonplace in human communication , they are not as effective in the classroom as might be expected ( Duit , 1991 ) . Uncritical use of analogies may generate misconceptions , and this is especially the case when unshared attributes are treated as valid , or when learners are unfamiliar with the analogy . Indeed , in using any analogy , care needs to be taken to ensure that an impression is not conveyed that the analog is a true description of the target concept ( Harrison and Treagust , 1993 ; Curtis and Reigeluth , 1984 ) . Many students do not realise that analogies operate on two levels . In simple appearance matches or descriptive analogies , one or more superficial attributes of the analog corresponds with the target , whereas true inductive analogies share both superficial and higher - order causative relations ( Gentner , 1983 ; Harrison and Treagust , 1994 ) . Systemic similarities between the analog and target induce func - tional relationships in the target , which transfer the explanatory structure from the analog to the target . Superficial attributes promote analogy recognition , accessibility and recall , but produce little growth in knowledge ( Zook , 1991 ) . The systematic mapping of true inductive analogies promotes deep under - standing , but is difficult for unskilled learners to transact . Because students have difficulty in recognis - ing the relational and explanatory power of an analogy , they often miss the real point of the analogy , and this is an excellent reason for teachers to use a systematic approach when teaching with analogies ( Keane et . al . , 1994 ) . Many researchers have provided different perspectives of the functions of analogies ( Chiu and Lin , 2005 ) . According to Holyoak and Thagard ( 1995 ) , scientific analogies have at least four distin - guishable uses : discovery , development , evaluation , and exposition . Among them , the most exciting is discovery , in which the analogy contributes to the formation of a new hypothesis . Once a hypothesis has been formed , the analogy may facilitate further theoretical or experimental development . Analogy can also serve to form arguments for or against a hypothesis’ acceptance , and then the analogy can con - vey the new ideas to other people . For instance , Benjamin Franklin ( Chiu and Lin , 2005 ) derived not only the idea for his experiment but also the basic hypothesis that lightning is electricity by grasping the lightning / electricity analogy . He also used that analogy to develop experiments . This implies that scien - tific analogies have been and can be used for more than one function for particular purposes . Wong ( 1993 ) considered that generative analogies are dynamic tools that facilitate understanding , rather than representations of the correct and static explanations or solution . Other researchers ( Harrison and Treagust , 1993 ; Brown , ( 1993 ) consider the use of analogies to be beneficial for conceptual change in science learning . Glynn et al . ( 1989 ) stated that analogies serve an explanatory and creative function . Duit ( 1991 ) also agrees with Glynn that analogical reasoning can facilitate understanding and problem solving . There is substantial support for Glynn’s conclusion ( Black and Solomon , 1987 ) . However , there are some studies that conclude that findings on analogical reasoning are not particularly promising The Effects of Analogy on Students ' Understanding 213 © 2012 , European Journal of Educational Research , 1 ( 3 ) , 211 - 223 because most students are unable to employ analogical reasoning to solve similar problems regarding different phenomena , and learners are not able to “see” the analogy ( Glynn , 1991 ; Gabel and Sherwood , 1980 ; Gick and Holyoak , 1983 ; Wong , 1993 ) . Analogies allow new material , especially abstracts concepts , to be more easily assimilated with students’ prior knowledge , enabling them to develop a more scientific understanding of the concept . Dagher ( 1994 ) reviewed several studies and comments on the role of analogies . She argues that al - though several studies claim that conceptual change occurred , analogies simply served as references for initial explanations or conjectures rather than bringing forth a conceptual change . Chi ( 2000 ) argues that analogies are considered a way of assimilating new knowledge to an existing structure and , there - fore , is not a conceptual change . Various studies have been conducted where children were observed and interviewed while learn - ing about electric circuits and current . For instance , Osborne ( 1981 ) and Tiberghien ( 1983 ) point out those children aged 8 – 12 years tend to believe that batteries provide flashlight bulbs with some type of material to make them work . Again , Osborne and Freyberg ( 1985 ) showed that students in New Zea - land aged eight to twelve years old used four learning models—the unipolar model , the clashing cur - rents model , attenuation models and the scientific model—when exploring the different types of electri - cal current . Maichle ( 1981 ) found that 85 % of the 400 secondary school students he studied considered that a battery is a reservoir for electricity or energy . Shepardson and Moje ( 1994 ) interviewed fourth graders and found that the majority of students understood the electric circuit via prior procedural and declarative knowledge . Before instruction , the students used more than one model and tended to use operational processes of procedure to describe an electrical circuit . After instruction , the students had a more precise procedural knowledge , but still had difficulty conceptualising the concepts of current with respect to parallel or series circuits . Magnusson , Boyle , and Templin ( 1997 ) argue that many studies have focused on serial connections ; however , students might conceive serial or parallel connections differently . The researchers designed a variety of problems to explore students’ ideas of parallel cir - cuits . The results showed that students mainly have eight mental models : the crossing currents model , the bipolar bouncing model , the bipolar serpentine model , the bipolar branch model , the bouncing model , the loop mode , the serpentine model and the scientific model . Analogies are ubiquitous in physics . They are used by working physicists , physics teachers , and students learning physics . James Clerk Maxwell explicitly stated his belief that analogies were essential to his own work . In formulating a theory on electrical phenomena , Maxwell claimed : “Instead of using the analogy of heat , a fluid , the properties of which are entirely at our disposal , is assumed as the vehi - cle of mathematical reasoning . . . The mathematical ideas obtained from the fluid are then applied to various parts of electrical science” ( Maxwell , 1890 ) . Some analogies may be both communicative and generative . David Bartlett has written recently on “Analogies between electricity and gravity” ( Bartlett , 2004 ) , providing an historical account and application of analogy . As a historical example , consider Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom ( Taylor and Zafiratos , 1991 ) . While the original utility was generative – producing a model that ex - plained experimental results ( which it accomplished more satisfactorily than competing analogies , such as the “plumb pudding” model of the atom ) – the analogy is often used to communicate an introductory atomic model to physics students . Therefore , analogies are not only useful to working physicists , but also to physics teachers . For instance , Coulomb’s law is often taught in introductory courses , as analogous to Newton’s law of gravi - tation . Electric current is often likened to water flowing through a pipe . Understanding how these analogies work is a rich area of physics educational research . Significant effort has gone into develop - ing a theoretical framework for describing analogies , which is discussed in depth below . Simultane - ously , experimentalists have asked specific research questions about the use of analogy in teaching physics concepts . For example , which analogy leads to better student learning about electric circuits – 214 Ugur et al . © 2012 , European Journal of Educational Research , 1 ( 3 ) , 211 - 223 water in a pipe , or a moving crowd ? In the 18th century the first serious experimenters with electricity saw analogies between the flow of charge and the flow of water , an analogy that persists today in the term ‘electric current’ ( Roland , 2006 ) . The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of analogical instruction on students’ learning of electric concepts and how eliminate students’ misconceptions . The aim of this study was not to test the effectiveness of any analogical model . It was aimed to discover how the analogical instruc - tion affected students’ success and their understandings of electric concepts . Methods Subjects : Participants in this study were 51 high school students who enrolled in the introductory physics courses , from the two classes of the same teacher . One class was randomly assigned to the ex - perimental group ( n = 27 ) while the other formed the control group ( n = 24 ) . These groups were se - lected according to an examination result by the school administrative committee . Therefore , the stu - dents in both groups have very similar knowledge levels . So , randomly selecting one of the groups as the control and the other as the experimental group . While the experimental group was taught with ana - logical instruction , the control group was taught with traditional instruction . During a five - week period , each group received an equal amount of instructional time and was provided with the same materials and assignments , apart from the analogical instruction that was used in the experimental group . The duration of the lessons was four 50 - minute periods , and the language of the instruction used for both the experimental and control class was Turkish . In this study , non - equivalent control group design is used to discover the effectiveness of the two different methods . The dependent variable was the students’ electric concept achievement measured by post concept test scores . The independent variable was the type of treatment referred to as ‘group’ . In this study , analogical instruction was used on the experimental group treatment . The analogies used were collected from the literature cited ( Glynn , 1991 ; Dupin and Joshua , 1989 ; Chiu and Lin , 2005 ; Sağırlı , 2002 ) . Electric Concepts Test ( ECT ) : The ECT test consisted of 12 items . The items of this test com - prised three parts . In the first step , students were asked to give an answer to the question . In the second step , the reason of his / her answer to the first questions was asked , and in the third step the student was asked to reveal how confident she / he felt about the answers given to the first two questions . A blank box was added for students who had different ideas on the first two questions . In this study , the re - sponses of the students who gave wrong answers to the first two questions and marked the “very confi - dent” choice were accepted as misconceptions . Responses such as “fairly confident” , “not confident” and “just guessed” were not accepted as misconceptions , because the students who gave such answers may have forgotten the lesson , or may have given such responses because of a lack of knowledge . During the development stage of the test , which constituted the qualitative part of the study , the following steps were taken into consideration : first , instructional objectives related to electric concepts were developed , based on the national curriculum . This step was carried out to define the content of the test . Literature related to the students’ alternative conceptions about the electric concept was then exam - ined . The test was composed of questions that were intended to measure students’ understanding of different concepts related to electric concepts . In some cases , however , the same concept was tested using two different types of questions . All questions were piloted and the required modifications were made prior to the administration of the test . A group consisting of one professor of physics and two research assistants carried out the content validity of the test items . The reliability coefficient of the test was computed by Cronbach Alpha estimates of internal consistency , was found to be 0 . 69 . The final form of the test was administered to both experimental and control groups as a pre - test before the The Effects of Analogy on Students ' Understanding 215 © 2012 , European Journal of Educational Research , 1 ( 3 ) , 211 - 223 treatment and post - test after the treatment . The questions in the text are about the amount of current , resistance connected series and parallel , brightness of the bulbs and conservation of current . Attitude to Physics Scale : This scale was used to measure students’ attitudes to physics . It con - sists of 15 likert - type items . Subjects were asked to express their agreement or disagreement on a five point scale ( strongly agree , agree , undecided , disagree , strongly disagree ) . The reliability of the scale was found to be 0 . 83 . The scale was administered to both experimental and control groups as a pre - test and administered to only the experimental group as a post - test after treatment . Three items on the scale in the following illustration are given as an example . Attitude to Physics Scale Strongly Agree Undecided Disagree Strongly Agree Disagree I like reading books related to Physics I like solving Physics problems I would like to learn more about Physics subjects Procedure : In this study , the same topics were covered for both the experimental and control groups . In general , students were given equal opportunities to perform the activities in each group . The control group received traditional instruction , which involves lessons using lecture / discussion methods to teach the concepts . Teaching strategies relied on teacher explanation and textbooks , with no direct consideration of the students’ alternative conceptions . The students studied the textbooks individually before the class hour . The teacher structured the entire class as a unit , wrote notes on the chalkboard about the definition of concepts , and handed out worksheets to students for them to use to complete the treatment . The teacher described and defined the concepts and after teacher explanation , some concepts were discussed and were directed by teacher - directed questions . The majority of the instruction time was devoted to instruction and engaging in discussion stemming from the teacher’s explanation and questions . Students in the experimental group worked with analogical instruction . Glynn’s Teaching - With - Analogy ( TWA ) model was used to teach each topic and topics were developed from an analysis of science textbooks to provide the most adaptable to classroom teaching ( Harrison and Treagust , 1993 ) . During the instruction time , the step - by - step TWA model was used and six such analogies were ana - lysed ( see Appendix ) . During the instruction , some analogies were showed directly to students in the classroom by using the required tools ; for example ; train , aquarium , u - pipe and water circuits - electric circuit analogies . However , the pictures of other analogies were drawn on the blackboard and presented to the students . During the presentation of the analogies in the classroom , students were assisted to both join the lesson and make a connection between basic electricity concepts and analogies with the help of a few questions . In this way , we contributed to the maximum participation of students in the lessons . At the end of the presented analogies ( after the discussion between the students ) the teacher explained the similarities and differences between the analog and target concepts again . Therefore , the students who made an incorrect connection between the analog and target concepts were able to re - organise their opinions . 216 Ugur et al . © 2012 , European Journal of Educational Research , 1 ( 3 ) , 211 - 223 Results In this study , the independent group t - test was used in order to compare the effectiveness of ana - logical instruction and traditionally designed physics instruction with respect to students’ understanding of electric concepts . The dependent variable was the students’ electric concept achievement measured by Post Electric Concept Test Scores ( POSTECA ) . The independent variable was students’ Pre Electric Concept Achievement ( PREECA ) measured by pre electric concept test scores . Table 1 .

This means there were no differences between the control and experimental group in terms of knowledge about the topic at the beginning of the study . Again in Table 1 , after treatment according to the post - test results there are significant statistical differences between the experimental and control groups , which indicate the successful nature of the experimental group , compared to the control group . While the correct answer percentage of experimental group was 31 . 75 % for the pre - test , the correct answer percentage has been 70 . 8 % for the post - test . These results indicated that the success percentage of experimental group was considerably increased after treatment . For the control group , the correct answer percentage of control group was 30 . 1 % for the pre - test , after treat - ments the correct answer percentage reached 51 . 75 % for the post test . So , it indicated that the success rate of control group , which were learned the topic in traditional way , was increased slightly . According to pre - test results , there are no statistical difference between control and experimental group’s students in terms of the achievement . ( as seen Table 1 , P > 0 . 05 ) . After treatment , experimental group’s students showed better performance than control group’s students . This success ratio caused significant statisti - cal difference favor of experimental group ( P < 0 . 05 ) . According to the results , conceptual misunderstandings were not eliminated completely in the two groups , although the experimental group’s misunderstandings were reduced more than in the other group .

According to the pre - test scores , there is no significant statistical difference between the two groups ( as seen in Table I ) . Nevertheless , as seen in Table 3 , after the instruction , the rates of the experimental groups’ correct an - swers considerably increased ; but the control group students’ correct answers did not increase at the same rate as that of the experimental group ( experimental group 84 . 09 % and control group 62 . 09 % ) . 218 Ugur et al . © 2012 , European Journal of Educational Research , 1 ( 3 ) , 211 - 223 Table 4 .

After treatments , the analogical instruction has no effects on the experimental group’s attitudes towards phys - ics . Discussion The main purpose of the present study was to determine whether or not an instructional manipu - lation that was designed to facilitate conceptual change and learning about electric concepts would im - prove students’ performance . Research related to instruction that is designed to remove students’ alter - native conceptions focused on strategies to promote conceptual change by challenging students’ alter - native conceptions , causing dissatisfaction followed by a correct explanation that is both understand - able and plausible to the students . We hypothesised that the students using the analogical instruction would demonstrate better conceptual understanding of the electric concept than students exposed to traditionally designed instruction . As hypothesised , the analogical instruction did lead to better concep - tual understanding of electric concepts . These results confirm the findings of previous studies in that an analogical instruction can facilitate the learning of scientific concepts ( Glynn , 1991 ; Dupin and Joshua , 1989 ; Thiele and Treagust , 1995 ; Harrison and Treagust , 1993 ; Chiu and Lin , 2005 ; Brown , 1993 ; Thiele and Treagust , 1994 ) . A new approach to change misconceptions of students is to build on ideas which match their students ' existing intuitive knowledge . This can be done by analogy . The use of an analogical relation between the known and the unknown can help students learn new information and discard or modify misconceptions ( Stavy , 2006 ) . The results from this study suggest that analogical instruction helped students to change their pre - existing conceptions or alternative conceptions with the scientific concep - tions by activating their alternative conceptions , producing dissatisfaction and presenting a correct ex - planation that is both understandable and plausible . The current study revealed that some alternative conceptions were still held onto , even in the ex - perimental group after treatment . Chinn & Brewer ( 1993 ) explained why conceptual change is so diffi - cult . Given information that contradicts a strongly held belief , an individual can ignore it , trivialise it , compartmentalise it , hold it in abeyance , change an insignificant part of the current belief but otherwise keep it intact , or undergo a more complete conceptual change . The Effects of Analogy on Students ' Understanding 219 © 2012 , European Journal of Educational Research , 1 ( 3 ) , 211 - 223 The analogical instruction did not make a significant difference to the experimental group stu - dents’ attitudes towards physics after treatments . It can be said that the teaching methods do not effec - tive factor on students’ attitude in a short time . The results demonstrated that using analogies both promoted profound understanding of complex scientific concepts and it helped students to overcome their misconceptions of these concepts . Accord - ing to pre and post test results , in the pre - test the correct answers rates of the two groups are very simi - lar ( there is no statistical difference ) . At the post - test , the control group’s correct answers ratios in - creased by considerable rates , although in the control group’s increase is limited . Wong ( 1993 ) consid - ered generative analogies to be dynamic tools that facilitate understanding . Other researchers ( Harrison and Treagust , 1993 ; Wong , 1993 ) consider the use of analogies to be beneficial for conceptual change in the learning of science . Duit ( 1991 ) also stated that analogical reasoning can facilitate understanding and problem solving . Conclusion The study shows that analogical instruction when applied to physics students will affect their un - derstanding of physics concepts . These efforts all contribute to the broad effort by the physics education research community to enhance instruction through a better understanding of student learning . This study has shown that when analogical instruction is used in a systematic manner , students’ understand - ing of electric concepts and elimination of misconceptions is more enhanced than with traditional in - struction . Science teachers can often use analogical instruction in their classroom to enhance students’ un - derstandings and eliminate misconceptions . While using analogical instruction , analogies should ad - dress the correspondence of its attributes and the relationships between the target concepts in order to make the connections more explicitly , the science teacher must become familiar with students’ difficul - ties in understanding scientific concepts in order to design meaningful materials to provide meaningful learning . In short , when analogical instruction is used , it is highly probable that these lead to a signifi - cantly improved understanding of scientific conception and the elimination of alternative conceptions .

Sample Question Q1 . Consider the following circuits . Lamps A , B and C are identical . What would happen to the bright - ness of bulbs A and B in the circuits if bulb C is added to the circuits ? a . The brightness of both lamps get lower . b . The brightness of both lamps gets higher . c . The brightness of both lamps does not change . How would you explain this ? The current in both lamps gets lower , so the brightness of both lamps gets lower . The current in both lamps gets higher , so the brightness of both lamps gets higher . The current that pass through the circuits does not change , so the brightness of the lamps does not change . The potential differences across the lamps do not change , so the brightness of the lamps does not change . If you have a different idea , please write it in the following blanks with your reasons . ………………………… . . How confident are you that your answers to this question are correct ? a ) very confident , b ) fairly confident , c ) not confident , d ) just guessing
