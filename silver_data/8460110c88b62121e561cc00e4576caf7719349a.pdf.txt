We estimated the anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibody prevalence among blood donors in Kenya . Methods We measured anti - SARS - CoV - 2 spike IgG prevalence by ELISA on residual blood donor samples obtained between April 30 and June 16 , 2020 . Assay sensitivity and specificity were 83 % ( 95 % CI 59 - 96 % ) and 99 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 98 . 1 - 99 . 5 % ) , respectively . National seroprevalence was estimated using Bayesian multilevel regression and post - stratification to account for non - random sampling with respect to age , sex and region , adjusted for assay performance . Results Complete data were available for 3098 of 3174 donors , aged 15 - 64 years . By comparison with the Kenyan population , the sample over - represented males ( 82 % versus 49 % ) , adults aged 25 - 34 years ( 40 % versus 27 % ) and residents of coastal Counties ( 49 % versus 9 % ) . Crude overall seroprevalence was 5 . 6 % ( 174 / 3098 ) . Population - weighted , test - adjusted national seroprevalence was 5 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 3 . 7 – 7 . 1 % ) . Seroprevalence was highest in the 3 largest urban Counties - Mombasa ( 9 . 3 % [ 95 % CI 6 . 4 - 13 . 2 % ) ] , Nairobi ( 8 . 5 % [ 95 % CI 4 . 9 - 13 . 5 % ] ) and Kisumu ( 6 . 5 % [ 95 % CI 3 . 3 - 11 . 2 % ] ) .

By the median date of our survey , only 2093 COVID - 19 cases and 71 deaths had been reported through the national screening system . This contrasts , by several orders of magnitude , with the numbers of cases and deaths reported in parts of Europe and America when seroprevalence was similar . All rights reserved .

Within one week the government instituted several containment measures to limit the spread of the virus and the number of fatalities . 5 While the number of new cases continues to rise ( 14 , 168 cases and 250 deaths as at 21 st July 2020 ) 6 , the rate is notably slower than in Wuhan , China or Europe . The proportion of COVID - 19 cases that are asymptomatic varies by setting . 7 However , in countries like Kenya , with a young population , it is likely to be high . 3 In addition , testing algorithms have ascertained only a fraction of the symptomatic cases in most countries . 8 Good public health planning requires information on the potential burden of the pandemic on the healthcare system and the collateral effects of any mitigation measures . In countries affected early , serological surveillance was used to define cumulative incidence . For example , at the release of lockdown in Wuhan , 9 . 6 % of staff resuming work were found to have anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . 9 At the end of the epidemic wave in Spain , seropositivity was 5 . 0 % in a random population sample of 60 , 897 . 10 At the tail of the epidemic curve in Geneva , seroprevalence rose over three weeks from 4 . 8 % to 10 . 9 % . 11 Currently , we do not have any estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in Africa .

To facilitate comparisons across studies , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) convened a network to share a panel of test sera and evaluate inter - laboratory variation . 14 Physical distancing and movement restrictions imposed as part of the COVID - 19 response make random population sampling impracticable and therefore several countries have monitored seroprevalence in convenience samples from blood transfusion donors 15 - 17 or expectant mothers attending ante - natal clinics . 18 Here we report the results of a pragmatic national serological survey using residual blood samples from transfusion donors across Kenya . Methods Setting , Participants This study was carried out at the KEMRI - Wellcome Trust Research Programme ( KWTRP ) in Kilifi , Kenya in collaboration with the Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service ( KNBTS ) .

The KNTBS guidelines 19 define eligible blood donors as individuals aged 16 - 65 years , weighing ≥ 50kg , with haemoglobin of 12 . 5g / dl , a normal blood pressure ( systolic 120 – 129 mmHg and diastolic BP of 80 – 89 mmHg ) , a pulse rate of 60 - 100 beats per minute and without any history of illness in the past 6 months . KNBTS generally relies on voluntary non - remunerated blood donors ( VNRD ) recruited at public blood drives typically located in high schools , colleges and universities . Since September 2019 , because of reduced funding , KNBTS has depended increasingly on family replacement donors ( FRD ) who provide units of blood in compensation for those received by sick relatives . Antibody testing using a SARS - CoV - 2 Spike Protein ELISA : Assay validation , selection and defining a threshold for seropositivity We adapted the Krammer Enzyme linked Immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) as follows 20 : Nunc MaxiSorp™ flat - bottom 96 - well plates ( ThermoFisherScientific ) were coated with 2µg / ml of whole trimeric spike protein or spike receptor binding domain ( RBD ) at 37°C for 1h , washed 3 times in wash buffer ( 0 . 1 % Tween 20 in 1X phosphate buffered saline ) and blocked with Blocker™ Casein ( ThermoFisherScientific ) for 1h at room temperature . Heat - inactivated serum or plasma samples were diluted 1 : 800 in Blocker™ Casein , added to the spike or RBD - coated plates and incubated for 2h at room temperature . After a further three washes 100µl horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) conjugated goat anti - human IgG antibody ( KPL - SeraCare ) diluted 1 : 10 , 000 in wash buffer was added to the plates , incubated for 1h at room temperature , washed 3 times All rights reserved .

Plates were read on an Infinite® 200 PRO microplate reader ( TECAN ) at 492 nm and optical density ( OD ) values for each sample acquired for analysis . The CR3022 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) was used as positive control , while a pool of sera from 50 adults sampled pre - COVID - 19 pandemic was used as negative control ( see article supplement ) . We explored different approaches to define seropositivity using well - characterised populations from before and during the COVID - 19 pandemic ( Table 1 , Table S1 , Supplementary text ) . For both the RBD and spike ELISA specificity was higher when using OD ratios ( sample OD / negative control OD ) rather than the raw sample OD plus 3 standard deviations . By OD ratio , each ELISA correctly classified 901 of the 910 pre - pandemic samples as seronegative and 15 of the 18 known reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) positive samples as seropositive ( Tables 1 , S1 ) . However , the spike ELISA detected more seropositive individuals among those who were investigated for SARS - CoV - 2 during the pandemic but were RT - PCR negative ( Figure S2 , panels A & B ) . Based on these data , we defined anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG seropositivity as an OD ratio > 2 and selected the spike ELISA for this study ; the sensitivity and specificity of this threshold was 83 % ( 95 % CI : 59 - 96 % ) and 99 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 98 . 1 - 99 . 5 % ) , respectively ( Table 1 , Figure S3 panels A & B ) . Data Analysis We tabulated seropositive results by age , sex and residence ( county or region ) . Because the survey was a non - random sample of the Kenyan population , we also calculated standardised prevalence estimates using population data from the Kenya All rights reserved .

We used 2 methods of standardisation ; 1 ) direct standardisation on the observed prevalence and population weights in 80 region - age - sex strata , and 2 ) multilevel regression and post - stratification ( MLRP ) adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay . 21 22 To predict stratum prevalence for MLRP we fitted a Bayesian logistic regression model that included sex as a fixed effect and age and region as random effects . 23 The Bayesian analysis ( see Supplement ) was done using the rjags package in R version 3 . 6 . 1 . 24 We used vague or weakly informative priors for all parameters except the sensitivity ( 83 . 0 % ) and specificity ( 99 . 0 % ) which took bounds from previous studies ( 62 . 0 % - 92 . 0 % and 98 . 6 % - 99 . 8 % , respectively ) . 21 . We plotted sample distribution and seroprevalence over time to illustrate potential time - trends and tabulated the distribution and seroprevalence across different donor groups ( FRDs vs VNRDs ) to explore potential biases .

We excluded 18 duplicate samples , 56 records missing data on age or collection date and 2 records from individuals aged ≥ 65 years , leaving a total of 3098 ( Figure 1 ) . Compared to the population structure from the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census , our participants were predominantly male ( 82 . 0 % vs 49 . 3 % ) , had more persons aged 25 - 34 years ( 40 . 1 % vs 27 . 3 % ) and more residents of coastal Counties ( 49 . 2 % versus 9 . 1 % , Table 2 ) . In addition , the 15 - 64 - year - old category sampled in our study comprises only 57 . 1 % ( 27 , 150 , 165 ) of the total population ( 47 , 564 , 296 ) of Kenya in 2019 . Those aged < 15 years and ≥ 65 years make up 39 . 0 % and 3 . 9 % of the total population , respectively . Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibody prevalence in study population Overall , 174 of 3098 samples were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 anti - Spike IgG giving a crude seroprevalence of 5 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 8 – 6 . 5 % ) . Crude seroprevalence varied by age ( p = 0 . 046 ) , ranging between 3 . 4 - 7 . 0 % among adults 15 - 54 years ; all 71 donors aged 55 - 64 years were seronegative ( Table 3 ) . Crude seroprevalence did not vary significantly by sex ( p = 0 . 50 ) but did by region , ranging from 1 . 9 % in the Rift Valley region to 10 . 0 % in the Western region ( p = 0 . 002 , Table 3 ) .

Seroprevalence was higher ( 5 . 1 - 6 . 2 % ) in the younger age groups ( 15 - 44 years ) and then declined in the subsequent age groups ( 45 - 64 years ) but was similar for both sexes . Seroprevalence was highest for Mombasa , Nairobi and the Western region though the number of observations for the Western region was small . The directly - standardised seroprevalence estimates are presented in Table S2 and the directly - standardised national seroprevalence ( 5 . 4 % ) did not differ substantially from the Bayesian population - weighted , test - adjusted estimate . Seroprevalence was also calculated for Counties that had at least 120 donors sampled . The three largest urban Counties of Mombasa , Nairobi , and Kisumu had SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence of 9 . 3 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 4 - 13 . 2 % ) , 8 . 5 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 9 - 13 . 5 % ) and 6 . 5 % ( 95 % CI 3 . 3 - 11 . 2 % ) , respectively ( Table S3 ) . The frequency of blood donor sampling and crude seroprevalence estimates increased with time over the 7 - week study period ( Figure 2 ) . The median sample date was May 30 , 2020 while the mid - point of the study was May 24 , 2020 . We did not adjust for sample date because the period of sampling varied for residents of different counties ( Figure 2C ) instead we show the variation in crude prevalence over time ( Figure 2A ) . The VNRDs were 7 . 6 % ( 236 / 3098 ) of donors while the remainder were FRDs . The two groups did not differ significantly by age ( p = 0 . 15 ) or sex ( p = 0 . 51 , Table S4 ) . Crude seroprevalence was 8 . 5 % ( 20 / 236 ) for VNRDs and 5 . 4 % ( 154 / 2862 ) for FRDs . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Discussion In this anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG seroprevalence study of blood donors in Kenya , the crude prevalence was 5 . 6 % and the population - weighted test - adjusted seroprevalence was 5 . 2 % . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first published report of SARS - CoV - 2 seroepidemiology in Africa . Surprisingly , population exposure across the country is considerably higher than previously thought . As expected , seroprevalence was highest in the three urban counties ; Mombasa ( 9 . 3 % ) , Nairobi ( 8 . 5 % ) and Kisumu ( 6 . 5 % ) . Consistent with other studies , seroprevalence did not vary significantly by sex ; 25 it peaked in 35 - 44 - year - olds and was lowest for those ≥ 45 years , which is also consistent with other studies reporting lower seroprevalence in older adults 10 11 Antibody responses are related to the severity of disease 25 and asymptomatic infections , which elicit the least detectable immune responses , are more common in younger populations 4 26 . In older populations , antibody responses may be modified by pre - existing HCoV - elicited immunity 27 28 and seroprevalence may also be reduced by lower risk of exposure ( ‘shielding’ at home ) . The prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in our study is comparable to estimates from large population - based serosurveys in China , Switzerland , Spain and the USA after the initial epidemic peak . 10 11 29 30 Our results are also comparable to other surveys All rights reserved .

Kenya has an estimated population of 53 million in 2020 and 57 % of the population is aged 15 - 64 years . A seroprevalence of 5 . 2 % would therefore suggest approximately 1 . 6 million infections among 15 - 64 - year olds in Kenya . By the median date of our survey , May 30 , 2020 , only 2093 cases ( of which approximately 90 % were asymptomatic ) and 71 deaths of all ages had been reported through the national screening system . 31 The period of sample collection overlapped with the period of government - mandated restrictions ; physical distancing measures were first implemented from 20 th March 2020 . Anti - SARS - Cov - 2 antibody surveys can be used to monitor the spread of the pandemic across the population and to inform mathematical models that predict the course of the epidemic . 32 Like many other countries , Kenya began easing restriction measures from July 2020 including re - opening of domestic flights which may increase transmission . We intend to monitor SARS - CoV - 2 spread by continuous sampling of blood donors throughout the course of the epidemic in Kenya to inform the national response . Serological surveys can also be used to estimate the state of population immunity . However , the low seroprevalence observed in countries that have experienced a substantial first wave of the epidemic implies that relying on herd immunity is unlikely to terminate the pandemic . At the same time , these observations have provoked a lively debate on alternative mechanisms of immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 including cell - mediated immunity 33 - 35 and the role of pre - existing HCoV - elicited immunity 27 28 as well as the function and duration of antibody responses following All rights reserved .

Despite our work showing HCoVs circulate in Kenya 39 , we did not identify evidence of cross - reactive antibodies to endemic coronaviruses in the validation of our assay . Other reports suggest that anti - spike antibody responses may be insensitive as a correlate of exposure to the virus or as a correlate of immunity to the diseases . 40 A key strength of this study is the rigorous validation that included samples from the target population as well as reference plasma from the UK NIBSC as part of a WHO coordinated effort on SARS - CoV - 2 seroepidemiology . In addition , we adopted a conservative seropositivity threshold to prioritise specificity over sensitivity . This is relevant in settings like ours , where seroprevalence is under 10 % and a similar approach has been implemented by others . 10 Although blood donors are not representative of the Kenyan population as a whole , we adjusted for bias in the sample structure by standardisation against the age , sex , and regional distribution of the Kenyan population . A substantial proportion ( 43 % ) of the population of Kenya are outside the age - range ( 15 - 64 years ) , sampled in this study . The small proportion of older adults in Kenya may be one reason why so few COVID deaths have been observed and the large proportion of children < 15 years may explain why so few cases have been observed despite significant evidence of transmission in the population . 3 Blood donors may also be unrepresentative of the general population because their risk of exposure differs . This bias could work two ways ; volunteers are excluded from giving blood if they have been ill during the last two weeks so the sample may All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Our exploration of the two distinct populations of blood donors , FRDs and VNRDs , suggests variation in the seroprevalence by donor group but , of note , 92 % ( 2862 / 3098 ) of our sample came from the group with lower seroprevalence . Conclusions Our study provides the first national and regional estimates of population exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 in an African country . The highest prevalence was seen in the 3 urban counties . The results suggest about 1 in 20 people aged 15 - 64 years have been exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 which is in sharp contrast with the very small numbers of COVID - 19 cases and deaths reported during the same period .
