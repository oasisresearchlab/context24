Vaccines are an important factor to sustain the 51 epidemic . Although with a relatively high - vaccination worldwide , the decay of 52 vaccine efficacy and the arising of new variants lead us to the challenge of 53 maintaining a sufficient immune barrier to protect the population . 54 Method 55 A case - contact tracking data in Hunan , China , is used to estimate the contact 56 pattern of cases for scenarios including school , workspace , etc , rather than 57 ordinary susceptible population . Based on the estimated vaccine coverage and 58 efficacy , a multi - group vaccinated - exposed - presymptomatic - symptomatic - 59 asymptomatic - removed model ( VEFIAR ) with 8 age groups , with each partitioned 60 into 4 vaccination status groups is developed . The optimal dose - wise vaccinating 61 strategy is optimized based on the currently estimated immunity barrier of 62 coverage and efficacy , using the greedy algorithm that minimizes the cumulative 63 cases , population size of hospitalized and fatality respectively in a certain future 64 interval . Parameters of Delta and Omicron variants are used respectively in the 65 optimization . 66 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Results 67 The estimated contact matrices of cases showed a concentration on middle ages , 68 and has compatible magnitudes compared to estimations from contact surveys in 69 other studies . The VEFIAR model is numerically stable . The optimal control 70 vaccination strategy requires immediate vaccination on the un - vaccinated high - 71 contact population of age 30 - 39 to reduce the cumulative cases , and is stable with 72 different basic reproduction numbers ( ùëÖ 0 ) . As for minimizing hospitalization and 73 fatality , the optimized strategy requires vaccination on the un - vaccinated of both 74 aged 30 - 39 of high contact frequency and the vulnerable older . 75 Conclusion 76 The objective of reducing transmission requires vaccination in age groups of the 77 highest contact frequency , with more priority for un - vaccinated than un - fully or 78 fully vaccinated . The objective of reducing total hospitalization and fatality 79 requires not only to reduce transmission but also to protect the vulnerable older . 80 The priority changes by vaccination progress . For any region , if the local contact 81 pattern is available , then with the vaccination coverage , efficacy , and disease 82 characteristics of relative risks in heterogeneous populations , the optimal dose - 83 wise vaccinating process will be obtained and gives hints for decision - making . 84 Keywords : vaccine , allocation strategy , SARS - CoV - 2 , optimal control , immune 85 barrier , contact pattern , greedy algorithm 86 87 Introduction 88 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f At the end of 2019 , the novel coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute 89 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) first broke out in Wuhan , 90 China , and then swept across the world at an extremely rapid pace . As of 91 September 27 , 2022 , a total of 612 , 236 , 677 confirmed cases globally with 92 6 , 514 , 397 deaths had been reported by WHO 1 . Although several targeted 93 interventions have been implemented globally to contain the spread of the new 94 crown epidemic , the situation remains challenging as dominant variant strain 95 updates one by another . A safe and effective new - coronavirus vaccine is essential 96 to reduce transmission , ICUs , mobility and even end the outbreak of novel 97 coronavirus . Although there was a high vaccine coverage with fully vaccinations , 98 the vaccine efficacy ( VE ) in preventing infection is not satisfying . The emergence 99 of new variants poses a challenge to the effectiveness of the new - coronavirus 100 vaccine . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began 101 recommending that all people who receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine 102 receive a booster at least 2 months in advance 2 . Regular vaccinations help to 103 maintain antibody levels in the body and a booster shot of the new - coronavirus 104 vaccine may be the general trend . 105 Vaccines are a powerful tool in the current fight against the epidemic , but 106 with limited supplies , it is important to consider who should be prioritized for 107 vaccination and what vaccine distribution scheme should be implemented to 108 maximize health and economic benefits . WHO believes that those who could 109 benefit from safe and effective SARS - CoV - 2 vaccines should have access as 110 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f quickly as possible , starting with those at the highest risk of serious disease or 111 death 3 . As age is one of the risk factors for serious SARS - CoV - 2 infections and 112 death 4 , the elderly population is the most frequently cited priority target group 5 6 113 7 8 , but studies have also suggested that there is a strong moral case for giving 114 children priority for vaccination to protect the elderly 9 10 . Depending on the 115 objectives , several studies have suggested that priority should be given to 116 vaccinating the elderly population against the new coronavirus to reduce the 117 number of seriously ill patients and reduce mortality , and to the young population 118 to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus 11 12 . According to the effectiveness 119 and availability of the vaccine , it has been suggested that in cases of low vaccine 120 effectiveness and low vaccine availability , it is preferable to allocate the vaccine 121 to the higher age groups first ; in cases of high vaccine effectiveness and high 122 vaccine coverage , it is preferable to allocate the vaccine to the lower age 9 . As the 123 dynamics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic and the status of vaccine 124 supply continue to change , we should adjust our immunization strategy promptly 125 and identify priority target groups for vaccination . 126 Most of those studies considers static allocation of vaccination instead of a 127 dose - wise or time - varying vaccination process . Besides , the dynamical model of 128 SIR ( susceptible - infectious - removed ) , SEIR ( susceptible - exposed - infectious - 129 removed ) , and SEIAR ( susceptible - exposed - symptomatic / asymptomatic 130 infectious - removed ) does not precisely represent the natural history of SARS - 131 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f CoV - 2 , where a considerable pre - symptomatic infectious stage acts in 132 tranmission . 133 To have a better understanding of the impact on age - specific contact patterns 134 and immune barrier in the optimal vaccination strategy , this study analyzed local 135 exposure patterns and vaccine effectiveness using case - contact data from Hunan 136 Province , simulated the transmission of age groups and computed the optimal 137 dose - wise vaccination strategy . A vaccinated - exposed - presymptomatic - 138 symptomatic / asymptomatic - removed ( VEFIAR ) model is developed with a pre - 139 symptomatic stage for better approximation of natural history of SARS - CoV - 2 . 140 The dose - wise vaccination process is considered for optimization instead of a 141 static vaccine distribution optimization for capturing more details . Unlike the 142 most previous studies that simulates the age - grouped models on contact data of 143 health people , this study considers the different behaviors between health people 144 and cases by using data of close contact to construct the special contact pattern of 145 cases and simulates . 146 Materials and methods 147 Data collection 148 A real world scenario of Delta variant outbreak in Hunan Province , China during 149 July 22 , 2021 to August 15 , 2021 is choosed to illustrate the optimal vaccination 150 strategy . Among all of 129 cases in this outbreak , 124 cases and their 13915 close 151 contacts or sub - close contacts have finished a survey of close contact tracing . The 152 information collected including age , sex , date of last contact , locations where the 153 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f last contact taken placed , relation between case and close contacts , exposure 154 ranking , and vaccination status . The definition and standard for judgement of 155 close contact and sub - close contact is given by the Diagnosis and Treatment 156 Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia , Version 8 13 . Data of all cases and 157 their close contacts are provided by Hunan Provincial Centers for Disease Control 158 and Prevention . 159 Statistical Analysis 160 We first evaluate the vaccine coverage in population by inspecting the four 161 vaccination status : none , un - fully vaccinated , fully vaccinated , and booster 162 vaccinated of close contacts in contact data . 163 The total attack rates ( TARs ) are computed for people in different age 164 groups and people with different vaccination status . To handle the uncertainty of 165 the collected data , we use bootstrap 14 to construct the empirical distribution of all 166 these TARs . We performed the bootstrap 10000 times on the contact data , with 167 each bootstrapped data set containing equally 10000 contacts . Each of those 168 bootstrapped data sets produces an 8 √ó 4 matrix of TAR in age groups ( in rows ) 169 and vaccine groups ( in columns ) . Based on those resampled TARs , we depict the 170 distribution of TAR in age groups and vaccine groups in box - plot respectively . 171 The following logistic regression model is used for analyzing odds ratios ( OR ) of 172 age groups and vaccination status groups : 173 ùëôùëúùëîùëñùë° ( ùîº { ùëå | ùêó = ùê± } ) = [ 1 , ùêó ùëá ] ùõÉ { ùëå | ùêó = ùê± } ‚àº binomial distribution 174 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f where ùëôùëúùëîùëñùë° ( ùë• ) = ùëôùëõ ( ùë• 1‚àíùë• ) is the canonical link function of binomial 175 distribution ; ùîº denote the expectation operation of random variables ; ùëå is the 176 0 - 1 random variable of whether a close contact is infected ( 1 represent infected , 0 177 represent un - infected ) ; ùêó is a 4 √ó 1 random vector with its entries be 4 factors : 178 vaccination status , contact age , contact gender and exposure ranking ; ùê± is an 179 observation of ùêó ; ùõÉ is a 5 √ó 1 vector of coefficients ( include coefficient of 180 intercept ) . 181 Based on the coefficient of contact age and vaccination status , the the odds 182 ratio ( OR ) are computed for different age and vaccination groups by : 183 ùëÇùëÖ = ùëí ùë• 1ùëá ùõΩÃÇ‚àíùë• 0ùëá ùõΩÃÇ 184 where ùõΩÃÇ is the fitted parameter vector of the logistic model ; ùë• 0 is the properties 185 of reference population ; ùë• 1 is the properties of target population . ( Note that the 186 exposure ranking and the contact gender are the same in ùë• 0 and ùë• 1 , and they are 187 vanished by ùë• 1 ‚àí ùë• 2 ) 188 Contact pattern analysis 189 We use a contact matrix to describe the current contact pattern . The ùëñùëó - entry of 190 the contact matrix is defined as the average number of contacts in group ùëó that 191 one individual in group ùëñ would produce during a period of one day . A bipartite 192 graph model is developed to describe the properties of the contact matrix . We 193 first construct the contact data matrix by simply fills all the case - contact data 194 pairs in . Then , based on the bipartite graph model , three methods of least square , 195 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f weighted least square , and maximum likelihood , are developed for estimating the 196 contact matrix . The contact matrices are also estimated using the subset of case - 197 contact data which contact occurs in specific scenarios of public transports , 198 amusement , school , household , hospital , working area , service industry , 199 community , catering industry , uncategorized setting , and empty settings in 200 original data respectively . 201 Model development 202 To evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination and heterogeneity among population , 203 a multi - group vaccinated - exposed - pre - symptomatic - symptomatic - asymptomatic - 204 removed ( ùëâùê∏ùêπùêºùê¥ùëÖ ) model is developed . The vaccine efficacy ( ùëâùê∏ ) is 205 considered as coefficients of reducing susceptibility . In simulation , we use the 206 odds ratio versus people of average age and average vaccination status , fitted 207 using the logistic regression , to replace the coefficients ( 1 ‚Äì ùëâùê∏ ) in the newly 208 infection term . 209 Modeling details including assumptions , interpretation of variable and 210 parameters are all presented in supplementary table S1 to S4 and section 2 . 1 of 211 the supplementary material . 212 The ordinary differential equations of the model is given by : 213 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f ùëëùëâ ùëñùëó ùëëùë° = ‚àíùúÜ ùëñ ( 1 ‚àí ùëâùê∏ ùëñùëó ) ùëâ ùëñùëó ùëëùê∏ ùëñùëó ùëëùë° = ùúÜ ùëñ ( 1 ‚àí ùëâùê∏ ùëñùëó ) ùëâ ùëñùëó ‚àí ( 1 ‚àí ùëù ùëñùëó ) ùúî ùëñ‚Ä≤ ùê∏ ùëñùëó ‚àí ùëù ùëñùëó ùúî ùëñ ùê∏ ùëñùëó ùëëùêπ ùëñùëó ùëëùë° = ( 1 ‚àí ùëù ùëñùëó ) ùúî ùëñ‚Ä≤ ùê∏ ùëñùëó ‚àí ùúî ùëñ‚Ä≥ ùêπ ùëñùëó ùëëùêº ùëñùëó ùëëùë° = ùúî ùëñ‚Ä≥ ùêπ ùëñùëó ‚àí ùõæ ùëñ ùêº ùëñùëó ùëëùê¥ ùëñùëó ùëëùë° = ùëù ùëñùëó ùúî ùëñ ùê∏ ùëñùëó ‚àí ùõæ ùëñ‚Ä≤ ùê¥ ùëñùëó ùëëùëÖ ùëñùëó ùëëùë° = ùõæ ùëñ‚Ä≤ ùê¥ ùëñùëó + ùõæ ùëñ ùêº ùëñùëó 214 where subscript ùëñ = 1 , 2 , ‚ãØ , 8 and ùëó = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 denote the subgroups of age ùëñ 215 and vaccination status ùëó ; ùúÜ ùëñ is the infection force acted on each individual in age 216 group ùëñ produced by all infected population , and is defined as : 217 ùúÜ ùëñ = ‚àë ùõΩ ùëòùëñ ùëõ ùëò = 1 [ ‚àë ( ùêº ùëòùëó + ùúÖùê¥ ùëòùëó + ùúÖ ‚Ä≤ ùêπ ùëòùëó ) 3 ùëó = 0 ] , 218 where ùúÖ and ùúÖ ‚Ä≤ denote different transmissibility of asymptomatic and pre - 219 symptomatic populations . 220 Then , ùúÜ ùëñ ùëâ ùëñùëó is the newly infection rate of subgroup ùëñùëó . And by considering the 221 vaccine efficacy inside age group ùëñ , we multiplies each ùëâ ùëñùëó by a constant 222 vaccine efficacy coefficient 1 ‚àí ùëâùê∏ ùëñùëó . In practice , we use the data estimated odd 223 ratios ùëÇùëÖ ùëñùëó versus average population ( Table S7 ) to replace 1 ‚àí ùëâùê∏ ùëñùëó . That is , 224 the newly infection term is obtained as : ‚àíùúÜ ùëñ ( 1 ‚àí ùëâùê∏ ùëñùëó ) ùëâ ùëñùëó = ‚àíùúÜ ùëñ ùëÇùëÖ ùëñùëó ùëâ ùëñùëó . 225 To introduce the impact of contact patterns in the multi - group ùëâùê∏ùêπùêºùê¥ùëÖ 226 model , the transmission rate coefficients ùõΩ ùëñùëó are formularized as the products of 227 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f the number of daily average contacts , the probability of infection after single one - 228 time contact , and the susceptibility of people in the ùëó - th group , that is , 229 ùõΩ ùëñùëó ùëÅ ùëñ = ùëê ùëóùëñ ùëûùúé ùëó , 230 where ùëê ùëóùëñ is the ùëóùëñ - th entry of contact matrix ; ùëû is the probability of infection 231 after a single one - time contact ; ùúé ùëó is the susceptibility of group ùëó . 232 The basic reproduction number ( ùëÖ 0 ) computed by next - generation method 233 is a function of all ùõΩ ùëñùëó and other parameters . With the assumption of 234 decomposition of ùõΩ ùëñùëó and the assumption of equal susceptibility in age groups , 235 ùëÖ 0 is indeed a function of contact matrix C , probability of contact infection ùëû , 236 and all other parameters and the disease - free equilibrium . In our simulation , the 237 probability of infection ùëû is solved from the pre - defined ùëÖ 0 for simulation , and 238 all ùõΩ ùëñùëó are recovered from the contact matrix ùê∂ and ùëû . 239 The grouped ùëâùê∏ùêπùêºùê¥ùëÖ model is tested by simulating with different ùëÖ 0 . The 240 contact pattern involved for recovering all ùõΩ ùëñùëó from ùëÖ 0 is set to be the contact 241 matrix estimated via maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) , and the first patient 242 ( indicator ) is set to be in age group 30 to 39 , with fully vaccinated status , just as it 243 was in this outbreak . For each simulated ùëÖ 0 , the daily incidence rates are shown 244 for each vaccine group , and the total attack rates in 100 - days are shown for each 245 age and vaccine group . 246 Table 1 interprets all parameters defined in the multi - group ùëâùê∏ùêπùêºùê¥ùëÖ 247 model . 248 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Optimization for dose - wise vaccinating process 249 The optimization of dose - wise vaccinating process is indeed an optimal control 250 problem that can be transformed into a nonlinear programming problem ( NLP ) 15 251 by discretizing the controls , and solved by a variety of numerical optimization 252 methods . Typically , one may use back propagation for sub - gradient , and use 253 stochastic gradient descent method for optimizing . However , in real world , the 254 vaccinating process is not always parallel with abundant vaccines , rather than a 255 small amount of step - wise vaccinating process . For this consideration , we use the 256 greedy algorithm 16 to approximate the optimal vaccinating process under the 257 current vaccine coverage . The function to be minimized ( the objective function ) 258 is constructed as the cumulative number of cases by taking weighted summation 259 of time integrals of all ùêπ ùëñùëó and ùê¥ ùëñùëó during the 14 - days simulation . This 260 objective can be also interpreted as if we assigned this dose to such group , then 261 what reduction of cumulative cases are expected within the next 14 - days . Other 262 indicators of concerned , like morbidities and ICUs , can be obtained by weighting 263 the cumulative cases by group - relevant morbidities and ICU ratios . 264 The directional derivative is introduced as an index for the effectiveness of 265 the current dose vaccinated in different groups . The optimal step - wise vaccinating 266 strategy is then obtained by minimizing the directional derivative for each dose . 267 We visualized the optimal vaccine process by showing the population - size curves 268 of each age groups and vaccine groups . Detail profiles of the optimization 269 problem can be found in chapter 4 in the supplementary material . 270 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f All analysis and simulation are completed using MATLAB 2021b . 271 Result 272 Epidemiology characteristics and vaccine efficacy 273 The boxplot in Figure 1 ( a ) shows the different distribution of bootstrapped 274 total attack rates ( TARs ) in age groups and vaccine groups . There is no clear 275 trend of TAR in age groups , and does not change much among groups of middle 276 age , mainly because mixture effects of factors like different vaccine coverage 277 among age groups . The medians of TARs in all age groups are around 10 % . 278 TARs in the youngest age group and the oldest age group are lowest , which can 279 be explained by its lower contact rate . One can conclude TAR in one group is 280 greater than the other group with 95 % confidence by inspecting whether the 281 notches of boxplots overlaps . 282 For the vaccine groups in Figure 1 ( b ) , similarly by inspecting the notches , 283 we conclude with 95 % confidence that the median of TAR decrease by doses . 284 The coefficients fitted in the logistic regression model are all significantly 285 differ from 0 , except the contact gender ( Table S5 ) . The odds ratios versus the 286 un - vaccinated aged greater than 70 and the odds ratios versus the average age 287 ( 38 . 6 year old ) and average vaccine status are then computed using the fitted 288 coefficients ( Table 2 and Table S7 ) . 289 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Analysis of contact pattern 290 The estimated contact matrix in Figure 2 ( b ) showed a small adjustment compared 291 with the contact data matrix in Figure 2 ( a ) . Both of the matrices showed a 292 concentration of contacts in diagonal entries and middle entries , which indicates 293 people in the same age group are more likely to make contact , and people in 294 middle ages are more likely to contact with others ( middle ages are more likely to 295 have children and parents to feed ) . Our matrices are coherent with the result of 296 the contact matrix in Wuhan and Shanghai , two cities in China 17 18 . The scenario - 297 specific contact matrices are presented in the supplementary material . 298 Optimal vaccinating process 299 The optimal vaccinating process is computed for different basic reproduction 300 number ùëÖ 0 = 1 , 2 , ‚ãØ , 12 , different objective function weights of cumulative 301 cases , hospitalization , and fatality , and different parameters of variants Delta and 302 Omicron in reference 19 . We included all those results in the supplementary 303 material , and present only the result of Delta variant with ùëÖ 0 = 8 . 304 Figure 3 answers the question which age - vaccine group should be 305 vaccinated first , and showed how the priority of each age - vaccination group 306 change with doses , which gives a hint for future vaccine distribution . 307 In the computed optimal vaccinating process , three objective functions give 308 a coherent result which requires an immediate vaccination to those un - vaccinated 309 in the age group 30 to 39 ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) . This can be seem from the upper - right 310 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f sub - figure of age 30 to 39 , where the population size of at least vaccinated one 311 dose increased since the first dose ( x - axis = 0 ) , which means the un - vaccinated of 312 30 to 39 should be firstly vaccinated into the un - fully vaccinated group . Since the 313 age group 30 to 39 is of highest contact frequency with other groups , this strategy 314 could be interpreted as to reduce transmissions at an early stage . The objective 315 function of hospitalization and fatality , however , requires vaccination on the 316 oldest just after the age group of 30 to 39 are all covered with at least one dose 317 for higher ùëÖ 0 , and interchange order for lower ùëÖ 0 . This can be interpreted as to 318 begin reducing cases in high - risk populations when the transmission is somehow 319 controlled . 320 Despite the age , and focusing only on the vaccine groups , we found that the 321 un - vaccinated group should be vaccinated first to reduce the cumulative cases , 322 since , in all 8 sub - figures in Figure 3 ( a ) , the un - vaccinated are always first to be 323 vaccinated . 324 Discussion 325 Validity of close - contact matrix 326 In transmission simulation of air - borne disease like SARS - Cov - 2 , the age - 327 specific contact pattern is typically obtained from a survey of susceptible 328 population 20 . However , in this paper , the dataset of close - contact survey from 329 reported cases is firstly used to reflect the contact pattern of cases . This 330 estimation may be more suitable for simulating transmissions if significant 331 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f proportion of cases behave differ from the susceptible population , and that is the 332 current circumstances with public health and social measures ( PHSMs ) . 333 Our contact matrix estimation method considers the nature of connection 334 between two sub - groups by using a bipartite graph model . The resulted 335 estimation is robust for lack of cases ( participants ) in some age groups , i . e . the 336 circumstances that one or more rows of the contact data matrix contains little or 337 even no cases . This method solves the problem by calibrating such rows by its 338 symmetric columns . 339 The estimated contact matrices are consistent with results from an age - 340 specific contact surveyed by a study 18 , suggesting the feasibility of simulating 341 scenarios like sex , age , school , workplace by our estimated setting - specific 342 contact matrices . The concentration of contacts in middle age groups reveals 343 some characteristics of social functions in each population . 344 The disadvantage of case - contact data may be described as the difficulty of 345 its collection . Without a comprehensive case - wise survey , it is almost impossible 346 to construct a reliable contact matrix . Also , the number of cases can not be too 347 small , which makes it not always available at the beginning of an outbreak . 348 The immune barrier 349 By November 2021 , 50 % of people has been fully vaccinated in China 21 . We 350 found a relatively high vaccine coverage with 27 . 5 % of none vaccinated , 13 . 4 % 351 of vaccinated but un - fully , 59 . 1 % of fully vaccinated and very little booster 352 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f vaccinated in Hunan Province , leading the local area an immune barrier to control 353 the outbreak of SARS - CoV - 2 . The vaccine effectiveness had been increased with 354 the enhancing of vaccination doses , which is similar to reports in study 22 . 355 The immune barrier is of great importance to restrain transmission and 356 reducing social burden of hospitalization and morbidities . In epidemics , new 357 variants , decay of vaccine efficacy lead us a great challenge of maintaining 358 immune barrier of population within a relatively high level . As a new variants 359 become dominant , epidemiologists must check whether the current immune 360 barrier is adequate or not . On the point of view of optimization , we can always 361 compute optimal vaccination strategy and observe its effectiveness using 362 parameters of new variants , vaccine efficacy and the equivalence coverage of 363 decay . 364 Validity of Multi - group transmission model 365 The multi - group ùëâùê∏ùêπùêºùê¥ùëÖ model consider heterogeneity of age and vaccination 366 status in population , which is a improvement of our previous studies 23 . The 367 model is simulated with real - world vaccine coverage and immunity using data 368 from Hunan Province . 369 The simulation gives highest incidence rate in people aged 30 to 39 years 370 old , which was consistent with a 27 . 56 % proportion reported cases in this age 371 group . This concentration is similar to a study indicating that transmission mainly 372 occurred in middle and old people 23 . 373 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Effectiveness of the optimized vaccination process 374 The dose - wise vaccination optimization strategy present a time varying decision - 375 making progress , showing the changing priority about which age group and 376 vaccination status group should firstly be vaccinated in further vaccination . 377 Sometimes it may be more instructive than the results of optimized static 378 distribution in 9 , especially for developing countries with small vaccinating 379 capacity stream . The greedy algorithm we used is simpler on dose - wise idea , and 380 easier implemented than other studies that transform the optimal control problem 381 of real - time vaccination optimization to nonlinear programming problems ( NLPs ) 382 24 . The optimization method we used can be easily extended for decision 383 variables of higher dimensions , considering heterogenity of age - vaccination - 384 region subgroups . Although the optimization method of greedy algorithm can 385 hardly found the global minimum for general optimization problems , however , its 386 objective of optimize efficiency for each dose meets real - world needs of reduce 387 the epidemic costs at any time within and before endemics . 388 The objective function decrease smoothly under the computed optimal 389 vaccination strategy , which support the stability of the optimization . 390 In practice , if local contact pattern is obtained , then we can optimize the 391 further vaccination strategy under current immune barrier for epidemic indices . 392 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Limitations 393 Vaccination efficacy decays over time , however , such consideration involving 394 assumptions about the speed of local vaccination capacity , and the decay curve of 395 the vaccine efficacy . The decay of individual vaccine efficacy can be introduced 396 into the dynamical model by using the equivalent decay of vaccinated population 397 size in dynamic models . However , we can omitted this for the amazing 398 vaccination speed in Hunan . 399 Since the contact pattern and odds ratios are estimated using data collected 400 in Hunan Province , the extension of the optimized vaccination process may 401 limited to Hunan Province . Regional contact pattern and other parameters are 402 recommended when extending similar optimization to other regions . 403 The optimal solution given by greedy algorithm is more likely be a local 404 optimizer rather than a global optimizer . 405 In practice , the high - risk occupations should be vaccinated with priority , 406 however , it is not considered in the age - vaccination grouped model . 407 Conclusion 408 The resulting dose - wise strategy illustrate the changing priority about which age 409 group and vaccination status group should firstly be vaccinated in further 410 vaccination , which may give us constructive suggestion to the decision . Under the 411 current vaccine coverage and vaccine efficacy , the objective of reducing 412 transmission requires vaccination in age groups of highest contact with other 413 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f groups , with more priority for un - vaccinated than un - fully or fully vaccinated . 414 However , the objective of reducing total hospitalization and fatality requires not 415 only to reduce of transmission but also to protect the vulnerable population of the 416 older . 417 The contact pattern estimated by the case - contact data depicts the behavior 418 of cases rather than the un - infected population , and will be more suitable for 419 transmission simulation , especially for diseases where significant proportion of 420 patients behaves differ from un - infected population . In simulation of emerging 421 infectious diseases , although the data - driven contact pattern is hardly available , 422 the uncertainty of differences between contact pattern that cause actually 423 transmission and the contact pattern of un - infected population in ordinary period 424 must be considered with suitable calibrations . 425 The optimization method of greedy algorithm is easy to extended for 426 heterogeneity consideration of partitioning the whole population into more 427 heterogeneous sub - groups . 428 Consent for publication 429 Not applicable . 430 Ethics approval and consent to participate 431 Not applicable . 432 Availability of data and materials 433 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f A PDF file contains modeling details and profiles of numerical solutions .
