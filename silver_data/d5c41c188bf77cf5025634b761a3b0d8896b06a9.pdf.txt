Heuser 7 , Xiaowei Zhuang 5 , 6 , 8 and Pietro De Camilli 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 10 Cell - free reconstitution of membrane traffic reactions and the morphological characterization of membrane intermediates that accumulate under these conditions have helped to elucidate the physical and molecular mechanisms involved in membrane transport 1 – 3 . To gain a better understanding of endocytosis , we have reconstituted vesicle budding and fission from isolated plasma membrane sheets and imaged these events . Electron and fluorescence microscopy , including subdiffraction - limit imaging by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) 4 – 6 , revealed F - BAR ( FBP17 ) domain coated tubules nucleated by clathrin - coated buds when fission was blocked by GTP γ S . Triggering fission by replacing GTP γ S with GTP led not only to separation of clathrin - coated buds , but also to vesicle formation by fragmentation of the tubules . These results suggest a functional link between FBP17 - dependent membrane tubulation and clathrin - dependent budding . They also show that clathrin spatially directs plasma membrane invaginations that lead to the generation of endocytic vesicles larger than those enclosed by the coat . To gain new insight into mechanisms of endocytosis , we developed a cell - free system suitable for monitoring the formation and progression of endocytic intermediates live at high resolution . Glass - attached plasma membrane sheets , left behind by sonication of fibroblasts grown on cov - erslips coated with poly - d - lysine , were used as templates to reconstitute cytosol - dependent membrane budding . Sheets were visualized by fluo - rescence microscopy , either by using cells expressing plasma membrane targeted GFP ( PM – GFP ) or by a brief incubation with the lipid dye Bodipy - Texas Red Ceramide ( BTR ) after lysis . Sheets kept in cytosolic buffer showed a diffuse and rather homogene - ous fluorescence , with only a few sparse puncta ( Fig . 1a ) . Within minutes of incubation at 37 °C with brain cytosol , ATP and the non - hydrolysable GTP analogue GTPγS , numerous fluorescence spots appeared ( Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) . Concomitant reduction in the glass - contact area of the sheets suggests that the spots represented mem - brane invaginations ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . Approximately 15 – 32 % of the total membrane area was sequestered into these membrane puncta during 15 min incubation ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . When the same experiment was performed in the presence of GTP instead of GTPγS , few fluorescent spots were observed at the end of 15 min incubation ( Fig . 3d ) , and shrinkage of the membrane was correspond - ingly smaller : less than 5 % was observed ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . Neither puncta nor shrinkage of the membrane was seen when sheets were incubated at 37 °C with nucleotides but no cytosol . To test if the fluorescent puncta were related to clathrin - coated pits , the cytosol was supplemented with Alexa555 - labelled clathrin . A near - complete coincidence between fluorescent membrane puncta and clathrin was observed ( Fig . 1b ) . These membrane puncta also incorporated classical coated pit cargo , as shown by using membrane sheets derived from cells expressing one such cargo , pHluorin - tagged transferrin receptor ( Fig . 1b ) . Clustering of transferrin receptors increased after incubation with cytosol , ATP and GTPγS ( Fig . 1c ; Supplementary Information , Movie 2 ) , and fluorescence in the remain - ing portion of the sheets decreased ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . Furthermore , sites of transferrin receptor clustering colocal - ized completely with clathrin puncta ( Fig . 1b ) , indicating that they are sites of clathrin - coated pit nucleation . To determine the ultrastructure of plasma membrane invagina - tions , three - dimensional stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( 3D - STORM ) and electron microscopy were performed . 3D - STORM is a super - resolution fluorescence microscopy technique with a spatial reso - lution of 20 nm in the x / y direction and 50 nm in the z direction 6 . For this technique , PM – GFP - labelled sheets were incubated with cytosol , ATP and GTPγS for 15 min , then fixed , labelled with antibodies directed against 1 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . 2 Department of Cell Biology , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . 3 Department of Neurobiology , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . 4 Program in Cellular Neuroscience , Neurodegeneration and Repair , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . 5 Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology , Harvard University , Cambridge MA 02138 , USA . 6 Department of Physics , Harvard University , Cambridge MA 02138 , USA . 7 Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , Washington University School of Medicine , 660 South Euclid Avenue , St .

Reconstructed STORM images show that the fluorescence membrane puncta , observed by conventional fluorescence microscopy , were in fact highly elongated structures perpendicular to the surface ( Fig . 1d ; Supplementary Information , Movie 3 ) . Thin - section electron microscopy , as well as deep - etch electron micro - scopy of platinum replica , complemented these observations by revealing a substantial presence of deep , tubular plasma membrane invaginations ( Fig . 1e – g ) , which were always capped by one or several small clathrin - coated pits ( diameter approximately 50 – 70 nm ) . Occasionally , clathrin - coated pits were also localized along the tubules . Most of the tubules had a diameter of 57 ± 6 nm . Typically , they tapered sharply at their tips , with a constriction at the boundary between the tubules and the coated pits ( 30 – 40 nm ) , and were often larger at their base next to the glass substrate ( 80 – 120 nm ) . Control plasma membranes incubated with cytosolic buffer alone revealed few features other than some membrane undulation and occasional clathrin - coated pits that were present before lysis . Cytosol plus ATP and GTP enhanced the number of clathrin - coated pits , but in both conditions the marked tubulation was absent ( Fig . 3c ) . Note that in both of these conditions , the PM – GFP fluorescence signal remained roughly homogenous ( Figs 1a , 3d ) . Thus , the invagination produced by a typi - cal clathrin - coated pit is not sufficient to generate a significantly higher membrane fluorescence signal relative to the surrounding membrane ; under our experimental conditions , fluorescent membrane puncta are in fact reporters of deep membrane invaginations . To gain insight into the molecular nature of the tubules , we explored whether tubulating proteins with putative roles in endocytosis might be present on these structures . Addition of fluorescently labelled dynamin 7 , endophilin ( a BAR protein ) 8 and FBP17 ( an F - BAR protein of the FBP17 / CIP4 / Toca1 family ) 9 – 11 to the cytosol showed that all these proteins were recruited to the sites of membrane invagination ( Fig . 2a ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S3 ) . However , although these proteins were localized to the same puncta in the x , y dimension , close examination in z stacks revealed segregation of these proteins along the axial direction of the tubules ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3 ) . Dynamin colocalized pre - cisely with endophilin both in the x , y dimension and in the z dimension . By contrast , dynamin and endophilin overlapped only partially with FBP17 in the z direction , being concentrated at the tip of the tubules . Stacked 3D - STORM images of membrane invaginations labelled for clathrin ( clathrin heavy chain directly labelled with Alexa 405 - Cy5 ) and FBP17 ( immunostained with Cy3 – Cy5 - labelled secondary antibodies ) further demonstrated that FBP17 was present along the entire length of the large tubules ( Fig . 2b , c ) , whereas dynamin ( directly labelled with Alexa 405 - Cy5 ) was localized in the neck between the coated pit and the FBP17 - coated tubules ( Fig . 2b ) . Accordingly , immunogold labelling of en face thin sections revealed that FBP17 was localized on the wide portions of the tubules . These tubules had diameters between 50 nm and 120 nm ( Fig . 2d ) , which is the same size range of tubules generated by FBP17 when overexpressed in cells or incubated in vitro with liposomes 10 , 12 .

L E T T E R S tubules to the clathrin - coated buds ( Fig . 2d ) . The diameters of these neck regions are 35 ± 5 nm , consistent with the diameter of dynamin - coated or endophilin - coated tubules 13 , 14 . We next analysed the temporal sequence of clathrin recruitment and tubule elongation . The distance between the clathrin signal and the PM – GFP - labelled basal membrane was imaged by 2 - colour 3D - STORM at different time points after the cytosol and nucleotides were added . Formation of clathrin - coated pits had already occurred at 5 min , with 2 . 1 ± 0 . 3 pits per μm 2 ( Fig . 3a , b , only the clathrin signals are shown ) . At this time they were located close to the basal membrane , with a mean distance of 90 ± 61 nm ( Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S4 ) . At 15 min , they had risen to a mean distance of 371 ± 204 nm from the basal membrane with 2 . 0 ± 0 . 3 pits per μm 2 ( Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S4 ) . Thin - section electron microscopy confirmed the assembly of clathrin - coated pits and their location next to the bot - tom surface at 5 min ( Fig . 3c ) . Thus , under these cell - free conditions , recruitment of clathrin precedes tubule growth , suggesting that clathrin is needed to spatially guide tubular growth .

L E T T E R S When antibodies that block clathrin polymerization were included in the cytosol , membrane sheets remained roughly flat , indicating a lack of tubulation ( Fig . 3d ) . This was further confirmed by electron microscopy ( Fig . 3c ) . The absence of deep invaginations , despite the presence of abundant tubulating proteins in the cytosol , suggests that formation of clathrin - coated pits is not only needed to spatially direct tubular growth , but also to trigger tubular growth itself . Pre - incubation of cytosol with anti - FBP17 antibodies also strongly inhibited plasma membrane tubu - lating activity ( Fig . 3c , d ) , consistent with a strong presence of this pro - tein in the wide tubular portion .

L E T T E R S dynamin did not prevent membrane tubulation , as indicated by the accu - mulation of fluorescence membrane puncta ( Fig . 3d ) . In the presence of latrunculin B ( 125 μM ) , which blocks actin polym - erization , clathrin - coated pits accumulated on the membrane sheets ( 2 . 3 ± 0 . 2 pits per μm 2 ) to a similar extent as in the absence of the drug , but they remained close to the basal membrane with a mean distance of 79 ± 39 nm ( Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S4 ) . Accordingly , electron microscopy showed that the tubules were absent under these conditions ( Fig . 3c ) . Many endocytic proteins , including proteins with robust tubulating activity such as FBP17 , are intimately linked to actin polymerization 11 , 15 , 16 . These results suggest that a synergistic action of actin and tubulating proteins is required for the formation of tubular invaginations in response to clathrin - coated pits nucleation ( similar results were recently reported in a system involving clathrin - dependent formation of tubular intermediates on giant unilamellar liposomes 17 ) . Interestingly , addition of latrunculin B ( 125 μM ) to the membrane sheets after tubules had already formed led to loss of the actin cytoskeleton while tubules persisted ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S5a , b ) . This observation suggests that , during tubulation , actin facilitates the assem - bly around the tubules of a stabilizing scaffold containing an F - BAR domain . Intermolecular interactions within such a scaffold may then contribute 12 , at least in part , to tubule stability after actin disassembly , as supported by the slow turnover rate of FBP17 on the tubules revealed by FRAP ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S5c , d ) . Importantly , under all conditions where clathrin - coated pits assem - bled but wide tubules were absent , including in the presence of anti - FBP17 antibodies , the necks of clathrin - coated pits were constricted to a diameter below that of the large tubules ( Fig . 3c ) . Thus , neck constriction and wide tubular growth are probably independently regulated proc - esses , with the latter more dependent on FBP17 . Finally , to determine whether fission could occur in our cell - free system , and whether tubular invaginations are important for this reac - tion , we monitored by fluorescence the appearance of free vesicles formed from PM – GFP - labelled membrane sheets and their recovery on Sepharose beads coated with anti - GFP antibodies . Generation of free vesicles was virtually absent in the single incubation with cytosol , ATP plus GTPγS or GTP ( Fig . 4b ) . However , when cytosol plus ATP and GTP were added to the intermediates generated by a first incubation with cytosol , ATP and GTPγS , a large number of free vesicles was observed in the medium within minutes ( Fig . 4a , b ; Supplementary Information , Movie 4 ) . These newly formed vesicles could be captured with minimal mechanical perturbation by addition of beads coated with anti - GFP anti - bodies , together with the second incubation mixture ( Fig . 4c ) , but not by control beads devoid of specific antibodies ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S6 ) . PM – GFP puncta on the beads colocalized precisely with the flu - orescent membrane marker BTR ( Fig . 4c ; Supplementary Information , Movie 5 ) , confirming their membrane nature . Thin - section electron microscopy of the material recovered on the beads demonstrated the presence of small 40 – 70 nm coated and uncoated vesicles , as well as of larger vesicles of 100 – 400 nm ( Fig . 4d ) . A corresponding loss of tubular invaginations replaced by vesicular struc - tures was observed on the membrane sheets ( Fig . 4e ) . These findings demonstrate the occurrence of fission and suggest that both clathrin - coated pits and tubular regions serve as precursors of free vesicles . The small vesicles are probably derived from the coated pits and the large vesicles probably arise from the large tubular region . No free vesicles were observed when GTPγS or latrunculin B were included in both incubations ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Antibodies directed against FBP17 did not com - pletely abolish , but significantly inhibited vesicle formation when added to either incubation ( Fig . 4b ) . Collectively , our results provide a striking demonstration of the hypoth - esis that membrane tubulation factors present in the cytosol are linked to endocytosis . FBP17 is one such factor , thus supporting an endocytic function of the FBP17 / CIP4 / Toca family , as previously suggested by functional 10 , 11 , 18 and genetic studies 19 . Our results further reveal a robust relationship between clathrin - coated pits and FBP17 - mediated tubula - tion . FBP17 was reported to be recruited to clathrin - coated pits in living fibroblasts 18 . The shallow curvature of the membrane - binding surface of its F - BAR domain led to the hypothesis that FBP17 and other members of the FBP17 / CIP4 / Toca1 family may function before the final constric - tion of the pits 18 , a process probably regulated by BAR - domain proteins with a sharper curvature , such as amphiphysin 20 , endophilin 8 , 21 and SNX9 ( ref . 22 ) . An even earlier action was recently demonstrated for FCHo , another F - BAR - domain containing protein 23 . FCHo is recruited before clathrin assembly and dissociates from clathrin - coated pits as they mature , and thus was proposed to nucleate them 23 . This function is unlikely to be generally applicable to other F - BAR proteins , as it is the carboxy - terminal region of FCHo , the μ homology domain , which has a key role in its locali - zation to clathrin - coated pits . F - BAR proteins of the FBP17 / CIP4 / Toca1 family , which contain a C - terminal SH3 domain instead of the μ homology domain , are recruited later to clathrin - coated pits 18 , 23 . Importantly , FBP17 is not an essential component of clathrin - coated pits in vivo , as it is not recruited to every clathrin - coated pit in non - neuronal cells 23 , and the triple knockdown of FBP17 / CIP4 / Toca1 has only a partial inhibitory effect on transferrin uptake 10 . Our findings are consistent with FBP17 - mediated tubulation acting after ( or in parallel with ) maturation of the pits , and independently contributing to membrane dynamics at the endocytic site , for example by regulating the extent of membrane internalized ( Fig . 5 ) . As in the case for all cell - free systems , the system that we have described does not precisely recapitulate conditions occurring in a living cell . However , it uses a natural plasma - membrane template and cytosol , and thus closely mimics the physiological environment . Hence , coordination of clathrin - mediated budding with the formation of F - BAR - domain - coated tubules observed in this study probably reflects Figure 5 Schematic representation of the membrane invaginations described in this study and of their fission . The model illustrates how an endocytic reaction triggered by clathrin may lead to both classical clathrin‑coated vesicles derived from the coated bud and non‑coated larger vesicles derived from the tubular region . nature cell biology VOLUME 12 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2010 907 © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . L E T T E R S physiologically relevant phenomena . In live cells , membrane tubula - tion is expected to be antagonized by membrane tension 24 , 25 . Membrane sheets prepared here represent a lower tension membrane template and may thus facilitate the production of tubular intermediates by FBP17 , which may act as a tension sensor . The prominence of such tubules will be further enhanced by an inhibition in fission activity . For example , elongated tubular intermediates capped by clathrin - coated pits with similar diameter to those described in this study have been observed in garland cells of shibire , a temperature - sensitive mutant of dynamin 26 . Nevertheless , similar intermediates have also been seen in wild - type cells 27 , 28 . The appearance of such intermediates may result from a tran - sient shift in the balance between tubulation and fission activity caused by regulatory mechanisms in vivo . In addition , unconventional roles of clathrin in endocytosis have been described previously 29 , and in some cases the endocytic reaction results in the internalization of plasma membrane fragments that are larger than the vesicle scaffolded by the clathrin coat itself 30 . Taken together , our study provides strong support for the importance of F - BAR - dependent tubular endocytic intermedi - ates in endocytosis , and reveals new endocytic intermediates that might correspond to a physiological stage of endocytosis . The generation of large membrane fragments from the plasma membrane sheets can be considered a form of clathrin - dependent bulk endocytosis . Thus , our study also demonstrates the possibility of using a cell - free system to study this still mechanistically elusive endocytic reaction .

DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb2094 M E T H O D S METHODS Reagents . Antibodies to clathrin heavy chain ( X22 , Affinity Bioreagents ) , dynamin ( clone 41 , BD transduction ) , GFP ( rabbit IgG , Invitrogen ) and gold - conjugated ( 12 - nm or 6 - nm particles , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) anti - rabbit anti - bodies were purchased commercially . Polyclonal antibodies to dynamin ( DG1 ) for immunogold localization were generated by our lab and described previously 31 . Polyclonal antibodies to FBP17 for immunogold and STORM localization were generated by our lab and described previously 10 . Fluorescent lipid BODIPY TR ceramide ( BTR ) was purchased from Invitrogen . Rhodamine skeletal muscle actin was purchased from Cytoskselton . All other chemicals were from Sigma . Cytosol . Adult mouse brains were homogenized in breaking buffer ( 25 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM KCl , 250 mM sucrose , 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . The lysate was centri - fuged at 160 , 000 g for 2 h and the resulting supernatant was desalted on PD - 10 ( Amersham Biosciences ) at room temperature into cytosolic buffer ( 25mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 120 mM potassium glutamate , 20 mM potassium chloride , 2 . 5 mM mag - nesium acetate , 5 mM EGTA ) . Aliquots of cytosol were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80 °C for up to 2 months . Purified proteins and their conjugation to fluorophores . The following com - mercial fluorophores were used in protein conjugations : Alexa 488 maleimide ( Invitrogen A10254 ) , Alexa 555 maleimide ( Invitrogen A20346 ) , Alexa 594 male - imide ( Invitrogen A10256 ) . Covalently linked activator - reporter pairs Alexa 405 - Cy5 maleimide were prepared as described previously 32 . Clathrin was purified from bovine brains , as described previously 33 . To con - jugate clathrin with fluorescent dyes , clathrin was reacted with the dyes ( Alexa 405 - Cy5 or Alexa 555 maleimide , dye protein molar ratio 8 ) at room temperature for 30 min . One round of polymerization and depolymerization was done to remove non - functional clathrin or aggregates . Briefly , the reaction product was dialysed into polymerization buffer ( 40 mM NaMES pH 6 . 5 , 3 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT ) overnight at 4 °C . The solution was centrifuged at 150 , 000 g for 1 h and the resulting pellet was resuspended into depolymeriza - tion buffer ( 20 mM TrisHCl pH 7 . 8 , 1 mM EDTA ) and dialysed into the same buffer overnight at 4 °C . After centrifugation at 150 , 000 g for 1 h , the supernatant was collected and dialysed into storage buffer ( 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 120 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) . Dynamin was purified from rat brains and conjugated with fluorescent dyes ( Alexa 488 maleimide , Alexa405 - Cy5 maleimide ) as described previously 34 . FBP17 was purified as GST fusion protein as described previously 10 . After cleav - age of the GST tag , FBP17 was conjugated to Alexa 488 maleimide ( Invitrogen A10254 ) by reacting with the dye ( dye protein molar ratio 4 ) at room temperature for 30 min . The final product was dialysed into a high salt storage buffer ( 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) . Membrane sheets . PTK2 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 10 % CO 2 in mini - mum essential Eagle medium ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum , 100 μg ml – 1 penicillin / streptomycin . PTK2 cells stably expressing PM – GFP 35 , transferrin receptor - phluorin 36 were maintained with 0 . 5mg ml – 1 G418 . To prepare membrane sheets 37 – 39 , cells were grown for 24 - 48 h until con - fluent in MatTek dishes ( MatTek ) that had been coated with 20 μg ml – 1 poly - d - lysine for 30 min and washed overnight . They were sheared in ice - cold cytosolic buffer ( 25 mM Hepes at pH 7 . 4 , 120 mM potassium glutamate , 20 mM potassium chloride , 2 . 5 mM magnesium acetate , 5 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) by a brief pulse of sonication ( about 1 s ) using a cell disruptor ( VirTis Ultrasonics ) set at 15 – 17 % of output power with a 1 / 8 - inch microprobe positioned at about 15 mm above the dish . After shearing , membrane sheets were rinsed in cytosolic buffer and used for the in vitro assay within 20 min . When a fluorescent lipid marker was used to visualize the membrane , membrane sheets were incubated with 5 μM BTR at 37 °C for 5 min and rinsed to remove excess dyes . In vitro assay . Membrane sheets were incubated at 37 °C with cytosol and nucle - otides as indicated . The final concentration of cytosol and nucleotides was as follows : cytosol , 4mg ml −1 ; ATP , 1 . 5 mM ; GTPγS , 150 μM ; GTP , 1 . 6 mM . Samples containing ATP were supplemented with an ATP - regenerating system consisting of 16 . 7 mM creatine phosphate and 16 . 7 U ml – 1 creatine phosphokinase 20 . Samples containing GTP were supplemented with a GTP - regenerating system consisting of 1 mM phosphopyruvate and 20 U ml – 1 pyruvate kinase . Fluorescent proteins added to the cytosol were used at the following concentrations : clathrin , 500 nM ; dynamin , 125 nM ; FBP17 , 50 – 250 nM . When indicated , cytosol was pre - incu - bated with anti - clathrin ( 0 . 5 mg ml – 1 ) , anti - dynamin ( 50 μg ml – 1 ) or anti - FBP17 ( 20 μg ml – 1 ) at 4 °C for 1 – 2 h . Heat denatured antibodies were used as negative controls . In real - time imaging , an oxygen - scavenging system ( 4 . 5 mg ml – 1 glu - cose , 1 . 25 μM glucose oxidase , 140 nM catalase , 71 . 5 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ) was included . For the two - step fission assay , membrane sheets were incubated with a dose of cytosolic mixture for 15 – 20 min , washed with cytosolic buffer and incubated with second dose of cytosolic mixture . For immunocapture of the fis - sioned vesicles , protein A Sepharose CL - 4B beads ( GE Healthcare ) were coated with anti - GFP ( 0 . 4 mg ml – 1 ) at 4 °C for 1 h , washed in cytosolic buffer , and added together with second dose of cytosolic mixture at a volume ratio of 1 : 10 . Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis . Epifluorescence imaging was done using a Leica DMI6000 inverted microscopy equipped with CCD camera ( Coolsnap HQ ) and temperature controlled chamber . A mercury lamp ( EXFO X - Cite 120 ) or a xenon arc lamp ( Lambda DG - 4 ) was used as light source . All images were acquired through either ×63 oil ( NA1 . 3 , PL APO ) or ×100 oil ( NA1 . 4 , PL APO ) objectives and the following filter combinations : Ex . : BP 470 / 40 ; Dich . 500 ; Em . : BP 525 / 50 for green ; Ex . : BP 546 / 12 ; Dich . 560 ; Em . : BP 605 / 75 for red ; Ex . : BP 565 / 55 ; Dich . 600 ; Em . : BP 650 / 75 for far red . Metamorph ( Universal Imaging ) was used to acquire either single colour image or sequential 2 - colour images using binning 2 . Real - time fission assay and FRAP experiments were performed on an UltraVIEW VoX spinning disc confocal ( SDC ) microscope ( Perkin Elmer ) equipped with Perfect Focus , temperature controlled stage , EMCCD camera ( Hamamatsu C9100 - 50 ) and controlled by Volocity software ( Improvision ) . All images were acquired through a ×60 or ×100 oil objective ( NA 1 . 4 , CFI Plan Apo VC ) . Green fluorescence was excited with a 488 nm / 50 mW diode laser and col - lected by a BP 527 / 55 filter . Red fluorescence was excited with a 561 nm / 50 mW diode laser and collected by a BP 615 / 70 filter . Two - colour images were acquired sequentially . For fluorescence recovery after photobleaching , a region of interest ( 50 × 50 pixels , 14 μm 2 ) was chosen on the sheet and the 488 nm / 50 mW laser at 100 % power was used to bleach this region for 100 cycles . Images were acquired by a ×100 oil objective ( NA 1 . 4 , CFI Plan Apo VC ) at 10 - s intervals and at least 10 frames were acquired before bleaching . Quantification of fission events was done by counting fluorescence spots in SDC images using custom written algorithm in Matlab . Briefly , for each reaction , a 30 - min movie ( usually 180 frames ) , including before and after adding GTP , was acquired at 20 μm above the surface . Median filter was applied to each frame of the image series and local background was subtracted . Vesicles were identified as pixels with local maximum intensity above a fixed threshold . The identified particles were overlaid with original movie for visual inspection . The number of the vesicles per frame ( 1000 × 1000 pixels , 14 , 400 μm 2 ) was plotted against time and fifty frames with highest number of peaks were averaged to give the final number for this reaction . For each condition , three to eight independent experi - ments were performed , as indicated . Quantification of FRAP was done by calculating the average intensity of the bleached region , which was corrected with background ( average intensity of a non - fluorescent region ) and normalized with the average intensity of a neighbour - ing fluorescent but non - bleached region to account for global intensity changes . The subsequent recovery curve was fitted with the Soumpasis equation F ( t ) = A · e – 2 T / t . ( I 0 ( 2 T / t ) + I 1 ( 2 T / t ) ) + B where I 0 , I 1 are modified Bessel functions , A , B and T are free parameters that describe the increase in fluorescence intensity after recovery F ( ∞ ) – F ( 0 ) , the fluo - rescence intensity immediately after bleaching F ( 0 ) and the recovery time . STORM . After the reaction , samples were rinsed and fixed in 4 % paraformalde - hyde , 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde and 5 μM phalloidin at room temperature for 20 min . In the case of immunostaining , after incubation with primary ( rabbit anti - FBP17 : 1 : 200 ; rabbit anti - GFP 1 : 200 ) and secondary antibody ( 1 : 200 ) for 30 min , samples were fixed for an additional 20 min . Imaging was done as described previously 6 , 32 . Briefly , super - resolution images were acquired on an Olympus IX - 71 inverted microscope equipped with a ×100 NA 1 . 4 oil immersion objective . Three activa - tion lasers and one imaging laser ( CUBE 405 - 50C and Sapphire 460 - 10 from nature cell biology © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .

A dich - roic mirror ( T660LPXR , Chorma ) and an emission filter ( ET705 / 70m , Chroma ) allows the single - molecule photoactivation events to be captured by an EMCCD camera ( Ixon DV897DCS - BV , Andor ) through a cylindrical lens that creates an astigmatism for 3D localization . The reflected imaging laser from the bottom of the culture dish was redirected to a quadrant photodiode , providing the feedback signal to a piezo objective positioner ( Nano F - 100 , Madcity Labs ) to stabilize the focusing of the microscope . One STORM image consists of 1 to 3 z - slices acquired at focal plane positions separated by approximately 470 nm to cover the entire height of the sample , with 5 , 000 – 10 , 000 raw image frames recorded per slice . After correcting for the spherical aberration of refractive index mismatch between the coverglass and imaging buffer 32 , each slice covers a z range of about 650 – 900 nm , depending on the distance of the focal plane to the coverglass surface . Crosstalk between colour channels was subtracted statistically . Electron microscopy . Samples were fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde containing 1 % tannic acid for 1 h at room temperature , rinsed 3 times in cytosolic buffer , stained in 1 % osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer ( 100 mM sodium phosphate , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH6 ) for 1 h , rinsed , en bloc stained in 2 % uranyl acetate in maleate buffer ( 50 mM , pH 5 . 2 ) and rinsed again . Subsequently samples were dehy - drated in an ethanol series and infiltrated using Epon812 resin and baked overnight at 60 °C . Sample containing resins were separated from the glass coverslip and the first few 60 nm sections from each surface were cut using a Leica UltraCut UCT . Sections were lightly stained using 2 % uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed on FEI Tencai Biotwin transmission electron microscope at 80 Kv spot size 1 . Images were taken using Morada CCD and iTEM software ( Olympus ) . Immunogold . Samples were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde and 5 μM phalloidin at room temperature for 15 min , rinsed , and blocked in 1 % fish skin gelatin and 10 % normal donkey serum in PBS for 30 min . Coverslips were then incubated with the primary antibodies ( rabbit anti - FBP17 1 : 10 , or rabbit anti - dynamin 1 : 10 ) for 30 min . After rinsed in buffer for 15 min , they were incubated in secondary antibodies ( 12 nm or 6 nm directly conjugated gold anti - rabbit antibody ) for 30 min . The samples were rinsed in PBS and then post fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde containing 1 % tannic acid for 1 hour at room temperature , and processed as described above .
