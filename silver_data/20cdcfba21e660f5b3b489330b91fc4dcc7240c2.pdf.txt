ABSTRACT Phagolysosomes are crucial organelles during the elimination of pathogens by host cells . The maintenance of their membrane integrity is vital during stressful conditions , such as during Candida albicans infection . As the fungal hyphae grow , the phagolysosome membrane expands to ensure that the growing fungus remains entrapped . Additionally , actin structures surrounding the hyphae - containing phago­ some were recently described to damage and constrain these pathogens inside the host vacuoles by inducing their folding . However , the molecular mechanism involved in the phagosome membrane adaptation during this extreme expansion process is still unclear . The main goal of this study was to unveil the interplay between phagosomal membrane integrity and folding capacity of C . albicans - infected macrophages . We show that components of the repair machinery are gradually recruited to the expanding phagolysosomal membrane and that their inhibition diminishes macrophage folding capacity . Through an analysis of an RNAseq data set of C . albicans - infected macrophages , we identified Cx43 , a gap junction protein , as a putative player involved in the inter­ play between lysosomal homeostasis and actin - related processes . Our findings further reveal that Cx43 is recruited to expand phagosomes and potentiates the hyphal folding capacity of macrophages , promoting their survival . Additionally , we reveal that Cx43 can act as an anchor for complexes involved in Arp2 - mediated actin nucleation during the assembly of actin rings around hyphae - containing phagosomes . Overall , this work brings new insights on the mechanisms by which macrophages cope with C . albicans infection ascribing to Cx43 a new noncanonical regulatory role in phagosome dynamics during pathogen phagocytosis . IMPORTANCE Invasive candidiasis is a life - threatening fungal infection that can become increasingly resistant to treatment . Thus , strategies to improve immune system efficiency , such as the macrophage response during the clearance of the fungal infection , are crucial to ameliorate the current therapies . Engulfed Candida albicans , one of the most common Candida species , is able to quickly transit from yeast - to - hypha form , which can elicit a phagosomal membrane injury and ultimately lead to macrophage death . Here , we extend the understanding of phagosome membrane homeostasis during the hypha expansion and folding process . We found that loss of phagosomal membrane integrity decreases the capacity of macrophages to fold the hyphae . Furthermore , through a bioinformatic analysis , we reveal a new window of opportunities to disclose the mechanisms underlying the hyphal constraining process . We identified Cx43 as a new weapon in the armamentarium to tackle infection by potentiating hyphal folding and promoting macrophage survival .

I nvasive candidiasis , a life - threatening fungal infection , can be caused by several Candida spp . , C . albicans being the most prevalent species worldwide ( 1 , 2 ) . C . albicans is a constituent of the microbiota in most healthy individuals ( 3 ) . However , as opportunis­ tic pathogens , under host immunity weakening , these fungi switch to virulent pheno­ types , which can consequently lead to fulminant sepsis ( 3 ) . Considering that innate immunity is the first line of defense against pathogens ( 4 , 5 ) , a better understanding of the immune cell response to counteract the transition between morphological stages of this microorganism is of utmost importance to design new strategies to strengthen immune system efficiency . Macrophages recognize , engulf , and eliminate C . albicans through phagocytosis ( 5 , 6 ) . After C . albicans internalization , the yeast may transit to the hyphal form , which involves the continuous length growth of the engulfed pathogen , which can induce phagosomal membrane damage ( 7 , 8 ) . Thus , to cope with these adverse conditions , macrophages mount an efficient cellular response to rapidly neutralize the hypha - induced cellular damage , avoiding cell death . Until now , the main described strategies adopted by macrophages to kill C . albicans encompass an increase in reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species production , a reduction of nutrient availability in the phagoly­ sosome , and a more acidic and hydrolytic environment in the proteolytic compartment ( 8 – 13 ) . Nevertheless , as a result of the generated tension from the expanding pathogens , phagolysosomal membrane integrity is commonly compromised , reducing host cell viability ( 8 ) . Thus , to counteract this deleterious effect , cells have developed strategies to repair and maintain membrane integrity ( 14 – 16 ) . These repair responses are triggered by the efflux of phagosomal calcium ( Ca 2 + ) to the cytosol , with a rapid recruitment of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) machinery ( 16 , 17 ) and scramblases to the injured sites ( 18 ) . Interestingly , some of these repair - related complexes such as ESCRT - I complex , including tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein ( Tsg101 ) ( 19 ) , and ALG - 2 - interacting protein X ( Alix ) ( 20 ) were already shown to be enriched in phagosomes . Moreover , these phagolysosomal membrane repair mecha­ nisms have already been associated with cellular response to lysosomal damage induced by pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( 21 , 22 ) , Listeria monocytogenes ( 23 ) , and Salmonella enterica ( 18 ) . In the case of macrophage infection with C . albicans , it was reported that upon Ca 2 + signaling , activation of the leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) ( 23 , 24 ) promotes the recruitment of the Rab8A and the ESCRT - III component CHMP4B to the yeast - containing phagosome . Ca 2 + efflux from ruptured membranes was also positively correlated with the activation of lysosomal fusion required to sustain the expansion of the phagolysosome upon hyphae growth ( 25 ) . Besides lysosomal membrane repair , ESCRT machinery was demonstrated to be required to fix the plasma membrane of epithelial cells infected with C . albicans ( 26 ) . However , the recruitment of ESCRT complex proteins to the phagolysosome containing the expanding hyphae remains unclear . In addition to the membrane repair mechanisms , the assembly of actin structures to fold the expanding hyphae was recently described as an additional defense mechanism used by infected macrophages ( 27 – 32 ) . In this process , macrophages promote the assembly of actin ring structures localized around the hypha - containing phagosomes , hampering pathogen growth and escape , and facilitating its complete engulfment by the macrophage phagosome ( 31 ) . Nevertheless , it is not known how the loss of phagolysosome membrane repair capacity affects the newly described hyphal folding process . Thus , here , we propose to investigate the impact of phagolysosomal membrane integrity on the hyphal folding mechanism and unveil new molecular players in this process . Our data suggest that the recruitment of membrane repair machinery to hyphae - containing phagolysosome is important to potentiate the folding process in macrophages . We also report that Cx43 , a gap junction protein , is recruited to expand­ ing phagolysosomes , localizes to actin ring structures , and promotes hyphae folding , through a mechanism that requires Arp2 - actin nucleation .

In order to restrain the growing pathogen and prevent phagocytic compartment rupture , macrophages can activate fast cellular response to seal the damaged membranes . Aiming to unveil the molecular partners implicated in this process , we evaluated the recruitment of two ESCRT machinery components to the membrane of expanding phagosomes containing C . albicans , namely , Alix and Tsg101 . To address this question , the macrophage cell line RAW264 . 7 ( RAW cells ) was infected with C . albicans for up to 180 min and then immunostained for Alix and Tsg101 , to assess their recruitment to C . albicans containing compartments . Lamp1 was used as a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes . Interestingly , the C . albicans yeast - to - hypha transition ( 180 min ) leads to a total increase of Alix and Tsg101 in phagolysosomes containing hyphae ( Fig . 1a and b ) . These findings were further supported by quantitative imaging analysis correlating the length of the internalized C . albicans with the relative amount of Alix or Tsg101 at phagolysosomes ( Fig . 1c and d ) , where a positive correlation was found between pathogen length and the extent of these proteins recruitment ( r 2 = 0 . 5492 and r 2 = 0 . 5889 , respectively ) . To confirm these data , infected macrophages were treated with 1 , 2 - bis ( 2 - aminophenoxy ) ethane - N , N , N ′ , N ′ - tetraacetic acid tetrakis ( acetoxymethyl ester ) ( BAPTA - AM ) , a cytosolic Ca 2 + chelator , previously shown to inhibit Ca 2 + - depend­ ent recruitment of ESCRT machinery ( 16 ) . Not surprisingly , the presence of BAPTA - AM decreased the recruitment of both ESCRT components ( Fig . S1a through d ) . Additionally , a more extensive colocalization between Alix or Tsg101 and Lamp1 was observed when phagosomal rupture was further potentiated by L - leucyl - L - leucine methyl ester ( LLOMe ) ( Fig . S1a through b ) . Of note , total protein levels of these ESCRT components were not significantly affected by the presence of the pathogen ( data not shown ) . We also observed that infection with heat - killed C . albicans or induction of phagolysosomal rupture by LLOMe also had no effect on the total expression levels of Alix or Tsg101 . Overall , these results strongly suggest that hyphal elongation is accompanied by an increase in ESCRT component recruitment to the phagosome , likely contributing to a continuous maintenance of phagolysosomal membrane integrity . Expanding phagosomes do not present lysophagy markers When the extent and severity of the lysosomal membrane damage overcome or delay repair capacity , the cells can trigger the clearance of these injured organelles through lysophagy , a type of selective autophagy ( 16 ) . This process is initiated by the recruitment of cytoplasmic galectins and glycoprotein - specific ubiquitin ligases to abnormally exposed luminal glycans at the damaged site , resulting in the engulfment of the injured phagolysosome by autophagic membranes ( 21 , 33 ) . We next sought to elucidate whether lysophagy machinery could be elicited in the cellular response to the growing hypha as a mechanism to provide membrane elements to the expanding phagosome . For this , we assessed the recruitment to phagolysosomes of galectin 3 ( Gal3 ) , tripartite motif containing 16 ( Trim16 ) , a Gal3 effector , and ubiquitin , previously reported to be implicated in lysosome removal upon damage ( 21 ) . In hypha - containing phagosomes , Gal3 was slightly recruited to the phagolysosomes ( Fig . 2a ) , and the correlation between Gal3 found in phagosomes containing the hypha and the hypha length was only moderately positive ( Fig . 2b ) , with a coefficient of determination of 0 . 3614 . Moreover , Trim16 recruitment was more evident in hypha - containing phagosomes than in compartments containing the yeast form ( Fig . 2c ) . However , as for Gal3 , only a slight positive correlation was observed between Trim16 recruitment to the phagosome and hypha length ( r 2 = 0 . 3327 ) ( Fig . 2d ) . Interestingly , when cells were treated with LLOMe , no Research Article Microbiology Spectrum September / October 2023 Volume 11 Issue 5 10 . 1128 / spectrum . 01238 - 23 3 FIG 1 Internalized C . albicans causes the recruitment of ESCRT machinery components to the expanding phagosomal membrane .

S2a and b ) . The total levels of Gal3 and Trim16 did not significantly vary after C . albicans infection ( data not shown ) . Similar to Trim16 and Gal3 , we also observed the recruitment of ubiquitin to hyphae - containing phagosomes ( Fig . S2c ) , although with only a small correlation between hyphae length and phagosomal ubiquitin fraction ( Fig . S2d ) . Moreover , to disclose the impact of C . albicans in autophagy , the total levels of autophagic proteins , such as Beclin - 1 , p62 , and LC3 , were assessed by Western blot . The results showed that the levels of these proteins are not significantly altered in macrophages infected with C . albicans ( Fig . S3 ) . Together , these results provide evidence that lysophagy machinery is not implicated in the cellular response to growing phagolysomes or in maintaining their integrity . Phagosomal membrane integrity impacts C . albicans hyphal folding Grounded on recent studies showing that inhibition of the lysosomal fusion reduces the integrity of the phagosome and facilitates hyphal growth ( 25 ) , we hypothesized that the hyphal folding machinery can be affected by phagosome membrane dynamics , with a FIG 2 Expanding phagosomes do not present lysophagy markers .

To evaluate whether defects on phagosomal membrane integrity and autophagy could also affect the folding process , we started by assessing the impact of BAPTA - AM , 3 - methyladenine ( 3 - MA , autophagy inhibitor ) , and LLOMe in internalized hyphae length . In agreement with previous findings ( 25 ) , we found an increase in hypha size upon treatment with BAPTA - AM , as well as in infected cells treated with 3 - MA and LLOMe ( Fig . 3a ) , suggesting that damaged phagosomes are more permissive to hyphal growth . Next , we investigated the effect of phagosomal membrane homeostasis on the hyphal folding . We quantified and categorized the percentage of hyphal folding on C . albicans when treated with the aforementioned compounds as none ( no visible folding ) , low folding ( > 90° angle ) , or high folding ( < 90° angle ) ( Fig . 3b and c ) . The results showed that loss of phagosomal integrity induced by BAPTA - AM , 3 - MA , and LLOMe treatment significantly reduced macrophage capacity to induce hyphal folding ( Fig . 3c ; Fig . S4a ) . The 3 - MA effect on folding capacity may be related with its direct effect on phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns3P ) formation , shown to be required for the FIG 3 Integrity of phagosomal membrane impacts C . albicans hyphal folding .

To further confirm that phagosomal integrity is crucial for hyphal folding , Alix was downregulated to hamper lysosomal repair capacity ( Fig . S4b ) . Accordingly , in cells with lower Alix expression levels , we observed not only a significant reduction of the total hyphal folding capacity ( Fig . 3d and e ) but also an increase of hyphal length ( Fig . 3f ) , when compared to control cells . Accordingly , silencing of Tsg101 in macrophages also induced a significant reduction of high and low folding , with an increase in the no detectable folding percentage ( Fig . S4c and d ) . Altogether these results suggest that phagosomal membrane integrity is required to allow the folding of intralysosomal hyphae , which is vital for host response against C . albicans . Cx43 as a new molecular player during C . albicans infection in macrophages Next , we sought to find new molecular players involved in the progressive response of macrophages to the yeast - to - hypha transition , with the focus on the overlap between phagolysosomal and folding - related mechanisms . We analyzed a publicly available data set ( GSE111731 ) that simultaneously assessed host and fungal pathogen temporal transcriptional profiles during macrophage and C . albicans interactions ( 9 ) . Initially , we compared the differences between consecutive time points : 0 – 60 , 60 – 120 , and 120 – 240 min , identifying 695 , 657 , and 235 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) ( P - value < 0 . 05 ) , respectively ( Fig . 4a ) . The results of the DEGs at each time point are summarized in three volcano plots ( Fig . 4b ) . In parallel with our progressive analysis comparing the different time points , we intersected the common DEGs of macrophages infected with C . albicans during different infection times . We found 21 DEGs commonly affected at the three time points ( Fig . 4c and d ) . Next , we used STRING database to integrate known ( 21 DEGs ) and 10 predicted associations for all the identified common genes , including physical and functional interactions ( Fig . 4d ) . The 21 common affected genes were clustered into four groups : cell migration , regulated exocytosis , translational initiation , and I - kappaB kinase / NF - kappaB signaling . As mentioned earlier , hyphae folding is a process that depends on phagosome vesicle integrity and the cytoskeleton network - mediating mechanical forces responsible for the migratory capacity of macrophages ( 31 ) . Thus , considering this information and the four continuously affected pathways , we intersected all the DEGs from cell migration , such as focal adhesion and cell leading edge , and vesicular structures , including endocytic vesicle and lysosomal membrane gene ontology ( GO ) cellular component ( CC ) terms , to further disclose new molecular players that could potentiate macrophage capacity to fold hypha ( Fig . S5a ) . The results revealed that 47 DEGs are shared between vesicular trafficking and cell migration - related pathways . We then observed the STRING network of these genes , which were clustered in four functional groups : locomotion , focal adhesion , actin filament - based process , and endocytosis ( Fig . 4f ) . As depicted in the heatmap from Fig . 4g , the expression profile of the identified 47 genes was found to change during C . albicans infection . Interestingly , we identified the GJA1 gene , which encodes Cx43 , as one of the putative hits affected during the infection process , with a decrease in the expression levels over time ( Fig . 4g ) . In the functional analysis of our network , Cx43 was associated with locomotion and actin filament - based processes , interacting with endocytic components , such as EHD1 , and focal adhesion proteins as integrins . Although Cx43 has been initially described as gap junction protein , studies from our group and others have ascribed to Cx43 additional biological roles , igniting a new paradigm in the field of noncanonical functions of Cx43 in cellular homeostasis ( 34 – 36 ) . In addition , increased Cx43 expression has already been associated with the cellular response to an inflammatory stimulus ( 37 – 39 ) being implicated in ATP release ( 40 ) . Therefore , we proceeded to further explore the putative role of Cx43 in phagosome membrane remodeling - associated macrophage response to expanding hyphae . Cx43 is recruited to the hyphae - containing phagolysosomes Given the importance of actin filaments in hyphal folding ( 31 ) and the recent reports associating Cx43 to changes in actin cytoskeleton architecture and intracellular Research Article Microbiology Spectrum September / October 2023 Volume 11 Issue 5 10 . 1128 / spectrum . 01238 - 23 7 FIG 4 Cx43 appears as a new molecular player during C . albicans infection in macrophages . ( a ) Schematic representation of our analysis . In order to correlate the different morphological stages of C . albicans , a progressive analysis was performed , meaning that each macrophage infection time ( T ) was compared with the previous one . Through the comparison of T0 – 60 , T60 – 120 , and T120 – 240 min , 695 , 657 , and 235 DEGs were identified ( P - value < 0 . 05 ) , respectively .

To address this issue , we started by evaluating the recruitment of Cx43 to C . albicans containing phagosomes by confocal microscopy . We observed that upon yeast - to - hypha transition , there was a gradual increase in Cx43 present in vesicular structures enclosing C . albicans ( Fig . 5a ) , and this recruitment positively correlates with the length of the internalized C . albicans , with an r 2 of 0 . 6456 ( Fig . 5b ) . Additionally , the recruitment of Cx43 to the phagolysosome was also verified when the membrane damage was exacerbated by cotreatment with LLOMe ( Fig . S6a ) . Of note , the Cx43 protein levels were significantly reduced upon 30 min of C . albicans infection , followed by a recovery to control levels after 180 min of infection suggesting an increased degradation of Cx43 in the early steps of infection ( Fig . S6a and b ) . These results hint toward a potential role of Cx43 in the macrophage response during the expanding process of the phagosome membrane containing hypha . Cx43 promotes hyphal folding To further elucidate the role of Cx43 during C . albicans infection , we generated monoclonal RAW cell lines overexpressing Cx43 ( Fig . S7a and b ) . By using this stable cell line ( RAW Cx43 + ) , we sought to assess the impact of Cx43 expression in hyphal length and folding . Remarkably , a significant decrease in length ( Fig . 6a ) and an increase in macrophage capacity to fold hyphae ( Fig . 6b and c ) were observed in cells with higher FIG 4 ( Continued ) plots of differential gene expression during the three - time comparison : T0 – 60 ( left ) , T60 – 120 ( middle ) , and T120 - – 40 min ( right ) , with significance [ −log10 false discovery rate ( FDR ] plotted against the log2 relative expression .

In contrast , in conditions where Cx43 levels were diminished , we observed a decrease in macrophage hyphal folding capacity ( Fig . S7c and d ) . To understand the role of Cx43 in this defense mechanism , we next investigated whether Cx43 could counteract the effects of compromised phagosomal membrane integrity during hyphal growth and folding .

Strikingly , the presence of increased levels of Cx43 not only reduced C . albicans hyphal length but also resulted in a higher percentage of hypha folding in cells treated with BAPTA - AM ( Fig . S7e and f ) . Accordingly , our data demonstrate that , in RAW Cx43 + cells , there is a significant increase in the total number of live cells with a concomitant reduction of death cells , when compared with the control cells ( Fig . 6d ) . As expected , when infected cells were exposed to BAPTA - AM , this inhibition of the repair capacity increased cell death percentage . Interestingly , increase in Cx43 levels also counteracted the effects of loss of membrane integrity by increasing the percentage of live macrophages , reinforcing its protective role on cell viability . In RAW Cx43 + cells , we also observed that after 180 min , the total amount of extracellular pathogens was reduced when compared with the control ( Fig . S7g ) . These data corroborate previous studies showing that hyphal folding is part of the strategy to constrain this pathogen inside the host cell with consequent reduction of their escape . As mentioned earlier , nucleation of actin filaments is pivotal to promoting hyphal folding ( 31 ) . Furthermore , it was previously reported that Cx43 ( 44 ) and its GJA1 - 20k isoform ( 42 ) modulate actin polymerization and stabilize filamentous actin . To deci­ pher in more detail the mechanism whereby Cx43 promotes hyphal folding , we next investigated the presence of Cx43 in the actin rings surrounding the hypha . Notably , our results showed a high colocalization of Cx43 with these actin structures ( Fig . 6e ; Fig . S7h ; Movie S1 ) . Considering the network analysis , where Arp2 / 3 protein complexes were identified as putative hits in the interplay between phagosomal homeostasis and actin - related processes , we determined whether Cx43 found in the actin rings could be implicated in the recruitment of this actin nucleator complex . In agreement , results in Fig . 6f show a robust colocalization of Cx43 and Arp2 around the actin ring structures , which are localized around the phagolysosomes containing C . albicans . Moreover , upon depletion of Arp2 using siRNA , we observed a significant increase in hyphae length and decrease in hyphal folding capacity in RAW Cx43 + cells when compared to control cells ( Fig . 6e through g ) . Quantification of folding angle revealed a significant reduction of hyphae with low fold in RAW Cx43 + cells . To demonstrate that this mechanism is not cell specific , we resorted to a HEK293A cell line overexpressing GFP - Cx43 . The results obtained with these cells showed the recruitment of Cx43 to actin structures surround­ ing frustrated phagosomes ( Fig . S7i ) , previously described in epithelial cells upon hypha invasion ( 11 ) , suggesting that the recruitment of Cx43 to actin ring structures may be conserved among different cell lines . Overall , the data gathered in this study support a model in which Cx43 has an unanticipated and important role during the formation of actin structures required to induce hyphal folding and prevent C . albicans escape from macrophages . DISCUSSION Phagocytic cells depend on several vesicular trafficking events to efficiently restrain , damage , and eliminate pathogens ( 45 ) . To circumvent the potential deleterious consequences of a defective phagocytic process upon infection , such as that of C . albicans , host cells have developed strategies to preserve phagosomal membrane integrity and confine the microorganism in a functional phagolysosomal vesicle . Here , we provide evidence that active phagosomal membrane repair machinery is required to not only support the continuously expanding hypha but also to promote hyphae folding , which was recently described as a new mechanism of host defense . Strikingly , our study also ascribes to Cx43 a novel and unexpected role during host - pathogen response by anchoring actin - nucleator machinery and promoting the fold of the expanding hyphae , protecting host cell viability ( Fig . 7 ) . Emerging studies have shown that the initial Ca 2 + - dependent response after lysoso­ mal damage is important for ESCRT machinery recruitment and consequent repair of minor membrane perturbations induced by pathogens or other lysosomotropic agents [ as reviewed in references ( 46 , 47 ) ] . Indeed , the recruitment of the ESCRT - III complex was described in cells exposed to chemical and bacterial - induced lysosomal damage ( 16 , 23 , Research Article Microbiology Spectrum September / October 2023 Volume 11 Issue 5 10 . 1128 / spectrum . 01238 - 23 11 48 ) . However , during extreme stretch conditions of phagolysosomes , such as the expanding hyphae - containing phagosomes , the role of the ESCRT components was not clearly elucidated . The data obtained in the present study demonstrate a direct correla­ tion between the recruitment of two components of the ESCRT - III machinery , Alix and Tsg101 , and hyphal size , suggesting that an active repair response at the phagosomal membrane is needed to sustain pathogen - containing phagosome growth through a Ca 2 + - dependent process . In accordance with our findings , a recent work demonstrated that the recruitment of repair machinery to the invagination pocket during epithelial infection with C . albicans relies on Ca 2 + levels . Furthermore , this study found that candidalysin secreted by C . albicans hyphae induced a cytosolic Ca 2 + increase , which promoted the hydrolysis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and loss of cortical actin ( 26 ) . Notably , a key finding of our study is that reduced lysosomal repair capacity diminished the ability of macrophages to fold the expanding hyphae . Wales et al . previously described a mecha­ nism of cortical actin disassembly induced by acute intracellular Ca 2 + increase termed as Ca 2 + - mediated actin reset ( CaAR ) ( 49 ) . This process leads to transient immobilization of organelles , repair of cortical damage , and the formation of actin - rich protrusions during cell spreading , cell migration , and wound healing ( 50 ) . Thus , given the existing evidence associating cytosolic Ca 2 + increase with actin reorganization ( 43 , 51 ) , it is plausible that the local increase of Ca 2 + released from damaged phagolysosomes can indeed impact the local actin polymerization necessary for hyphal folding . During the hyphal folding process , adhesion molecules , such as Dectin - 1 and β2 , as well as cytoskeletal network - mediated mechanical forces responsible for cell migration capacity were found to promote the ability of macrophages to fold and damage the expanding C . albicans ( 31 ) . However , little is known about the molecular players with the capacity to promote actin assembly and modulate phagolysosomal membrane architecture . The analysis of the differentially expressed genes throughout the event of FIG 7 Schematic summary of Cx43 as a new player in C . albicans infection of macrophages . Maintenance of the phagosomal membrane integrity is essential to control the hyphal growth and potentiate the folding capacity of the macrophages , promoting an additional defense and avoiding C . albicans escape from the ruptured phagosome . In addition , our work showed that Cx43 is recruited to the phagosome containing hypha and its protein levels seem to affect the hypha folding capacity of macrophages . Interestingly , Cx43 and Arp2 are present in the F - actin contractile rings around the phagosomes containing the hypha and seem to be recruited to the folding sites , suggesting a new role for Cx43 in the C . albicans folding process . Research Article Microbiology Spectrum September / October 2023 Volume 11 Issue 5 10 . 1128 / spectrum . 01238 - 23 12 macrophage infection unveils new putative partners involved in the interplay between phagosomal membrane and actin network - related events . Remarkably , Cx43 emerges as a new player in this biological process . Interestingly , several noncanonical roles beyond gap junction function have been ascribed to Cx43 , including its involvement in long - distance intercellular communication ( 52 ) , selective sorting of microRNA to extracellular vesicles ( 53 ) , mitochondrial homeostasis ( 54 , 55 ) and localization ( 41 ) , and nuclear structure ( 56 ) . Furthermore , previous studies demonstrated that GJA1 - 20k , which is mainly formed by the C - terminus of Cx43 , can inhibit actin depolymerization and stabilize actin filaments ( 42 , 54 ) and is able to promote mitochondrial fission by engaging actin to the mitochondria ( 54 ) . Here , we found that Cx43 is recruited to the expanding phagosome and promotes hyphal fold , possibly by anchoring Arp2 . These findings are in accordance with our recent work showing that Cx43 is recruited to damaged lysosomes and promotes exocytosis through the remodeling of actin cytoskeleton ( 44 ) . In this process , we found that Cx43 effect on actin rearrangement is dependent on Arp2 activity ( 44 ) . Additionally , supporting our hypothesis , compo­ nents from this actin nucleator protein were also identified in our STRING analysis , namely , actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex subunit 5 ( ARCP5 ) , a component of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and actin - related protein 2 ( ACTR2 ) , an ATP - binding component of the Arp2 / 3 complex , promoter of branched actin networks . In the work by Bain et al . , the folding process was shown to involve vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein actin elongation , and by inhibiting the nucleation with actin inhibitors , cytochalasin D and latrunculin , the folding capacity was reduced . In actin cuffs , observed in epithelial cells infected with C . albicans ( 11 ) , actin assembly was shown to be dependent on formin , which mediates linear actin polymerization and independent of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Although these actin cuffs share some molecular players with the actin rings character­ ized in the folding apparatus ( 31 ) , a direct and functional comparison study was never performed . An obvious difference when we consider these two processes is related to the fact that actin cuffs are assembled on the plasma membrane , while the actin rings inducing hyphae fold are formed in intracellular membranes , i . e . , the phagolysosomal membrane . Interestingly , during the mitochondrial fission process , the focal assembly of actin induces local , Drp1 - dependent fragmentation of the mitochondrial network in a process dependent on Arp2 / 3 and formin ( 57 ) . This suggests that the necessary mechanical forces to induce intracellular membranes stretch can differ from the plasma membrane mechanism . Thus , we believe that Cx43 and Arp2 are both involved in the assembly of actin structures necessary to exert mechanical forces for the stretch and fission of intracellular membrane . In conclusion , this study demonstrates for the first time that phagolysosomal membrane integrity is necessary to potentiate the hyphal folding process . Furthermore , we show that Cx43 plays a pivotal role during this defense mechanism by contributing to anchor complexes involved in the actin nucleation process and promoting cell host survival .

Yeast cells were grown at 30°C overnight in yeast extract peptone dextrose ( YPD ) ( 0 . 5 % yeast extract , 1 % peptone , 2 % agar , and 2 % glucose ) agar plates , harvested by centrifugation , and resuspended in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Yeasts were heat - killed at 95°C during 30 min and used as an inactive pathogen . The fungal cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber and adjusted to the required cell density . Cell lines Experiments were carried out using the RAW 264 . 7 macrophage cell line , obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures ( ECACC 91062702 ) . Generation of RAW cells with increased levels of Cx43 ( RAW Cx43 ) is described in the section Cell infection with the lentiviral vector . Generation of the GFP - HEK293 Cx43 was previously described ( 58 ) . RAW 264 . 7 cells were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium ( DMEM ; Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , supplemented with 10 % non - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco , Life Technologies ) , 3 . 7 g / L sodium bicarbonate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Pen / Strep 100 U / mL : 100 µg / mL ; Life Technolo­ gies ) at 37°C , in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 . GFP - HEK293 Cx43 was grown at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 in DMEM ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated FBS ( Gibco , Life Technologies ) . C . albicans infection assays RAW cells ( 1 . 05 × 10 5 cells / cm 2 ) were seeded in 6 - or 24 - well plates and allowed to adhere and stabilize for 24 h at 37°C , in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 . Macrophages were then washed with PBS and infected with C . albicans ( multiplicity of infection , 1 : 1 ) , for 1 h at 37°C ( pulse ) , in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % of CO 2 . Then , the non - adherent yeast cells were washed , and C . albicans were allowed to internalize for 30 min or 180 min ( chase ) . Cells were treated with 3 - MA ( 20 µM ) and CBX ( 10 µM ) 60 min and 10 min prior to infection , respectively , and compounds were maintained during the experiment time . BAPTA - AM ( 20 µM ) was added at the chase time . LLOMe ( 500 µM ) was added 10 min and 30 min before the end of the infection period , 30 and 180 min , respectively . LLOMe was used as positive control for damaged lysosomes . Incubation time points were 30 min , characterized for a higher number of C . albicans in the yeast form , and 180 min characterized for an increasing number of C . albicans in the hyphal form . Colony - forming unit After C . albicans infection internalization for 1 h , non - internalized extracellular fungi were removed with two PBS washes , and cells were further incubated with fresh culture medium without antibiotic during 180 min . C . albicans viability was then evaluated using a colony - forming unit ( CFU ) assay . The supernatants , corresponding to expelled / extrac­ ellular C . albicans , were collected , and the adhered cells were then lysed with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in sterile distilled water and scraped ( fraction corresponding to intracellular Research Article Microbiology Spectrum September / October 2023 Volume 11 Issue 5 10 . 1128 / spectrum . 01238 - 23 14 fungae ) . Serial dilutions were performed , and each condition was spread on nutrient agar plates , with colony counting after 24 h at 37°C . Immunofluorescence and image acquisition After each timepoint ( 30 min or 180 min after infection ) , the glass coverslips were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( pH 7 . 4 ) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature . Then , the samples were washed , followed by quenching of the aldehyde groups with ammonium chloride ( concentration 50 mM ) in 1 % PBS for 15 min and afterwards blocked with a solution of 0 . 05 % ( wt / vol ) saponin and 1 % ( wt / vol ) BSA , in PBS ( blocking solution ) , for 30 min prior to incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber . The coverslips were then washed with PBS and incubated with the secon­ dary antibody for 1 h at room temperature , in a humid chamber . Nuclei were stained with 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . After this , coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted with MOWIOL 4 - 88 Reagent ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA , USA ) . The images were collected by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axio HXP IRE 2 microscope ( Carl Zeiss AG ) or by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 710 ( Carl Zeiss AG ) , using 63× oil immersion objective . Images were then analyzed and quantified using Image J - Fiji ( described in detail in the section Quantification of the percent of phagosomal proteins ) and Imaris softwares . Surface rendering was performed in 8 - to 15 - µm z - stack images composed of 0 . 43 - µm optical slices using Imaris software ( Bitplane AG , Switzerland ) and carried out at the Imaging facility at iCBR ( iLab - FMUC ) . Quantification of the percentage of phagosomal proteins The percentage of the proteins in the phagosomal membrane was estimated by measuring the intensity of phagosome - associated proteins per the total cellular intensity of the specific protein multiplied by 100 at different time points ( 30 min and 180 min post - infection ) using ImageJ software . For protein detection , a threshold was applied . Each phagosome was manually designed using the boundaries of C . albicans and / or Lamp - 1 staining . Measurement of hyphal folding Macrophages with phagocytosed C . albicans had its hyphal folding measured and categorized as “none” ( no detectable bending or folding ) , “low fold” ( creating a curved hypha or an obtuse angle ) , or “high fold” ( generating an acute angle ) , using ImageJ software . Gene set enrichment analysis The RNA expression profile of GSE111731 data set was used in this study . The DEGs were obtained by the application of a linear model to the voom - transformed data , using the limma package , for the statistical programming language R . Heatmaps were generated with Complex heatmap package for the statistical programming environment R . The DEGs involved in all the pathways related with vesicles and cell migration GO CC terms were intersected , resulting in 47 common genes . The search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes ( STRING ) database ( 11 . 5 ) was applied to integrate known protein - pro­ tein interactions . The correlation between these proteins was evaluated and displayed . Cell infection with the lentiviral vector RAW cells were incubated with the lentiviral vector pLenti6 - CMV - V5 - Cx43 and 8 µg / mL of polybrene for 20 min at room temperature . Then , cells were centrifuged for 90 min at 800 × g and 32°C , plated , and incubated with 8 µg / mL of blasticidin . In order to isolate single cell clones from the polyclonal pool , limiting dilution cloning in a 96 - well plate was applied by targeting 0 . 5 cells / well in complete growth medium , then transferring Research Article Microbiology Spectrum September / October 2023 Volume 11 Issue 5 10 . 1128 / spectrum . 01238 - 23 15 100 µL of this to each . Plates were then incubated at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 incubator , and the clonal expansion was monitored during the next days . Overexpression of Cx43 on the monoclonal RAW cell lines was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis . siRNA - mediated knockdown siRNA transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions . siRNA target sequences were Alix ( Dharmacon , siGENOME SMARTpool M - 004233 - 02 - 0005 ) , Cx43 ( MISSION esiRNA EHU105621 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , and Arp2 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , s94586 ) . A total of 20 nmol / L siRNA was complexed with the transfection reagent , and an overnight incubation at 37°C was performed . After that , transfection media were replaced with fresh media , and the experiments were performed after 72 h ( Alix and Cx43 ) or 48 h ( Arp2 ) . Non - targeting control sequences ( Ambion ) were used as controls . Immunoblotting At the end of each timepoint ( 30 min or 180 min , post - infection ) , RAW cells were detached and centrifuged at 1 , 200 rpm , for 5 min , at 4°C . Then , the supernatants were removed , and cell pellets were washed with PBS and again centrifuged at 1 , 200 rpm , for 5 min , at 4°C . Cell pellets were lysed to obtain total protein extracts using 2× Laemmli buffer . The cell lysates were then sonicated , heated for 5 min at 95°C , and loaded on 10 – 15 % SDS polyacrylamide gels , using Precision Plus Protein Dual Color Standards ( BioRad ) or GRS Protein Marker MultiColour ( GRiSP Research Solutions ) as protein ladders . After electrophoresis , proteins were electrotransferred for 2 h at 300 mA with gentle agitation into polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes , which were previously activated in methanol . To control protein loading , PVDF membranes were stained with Ponceau S . After washing , membranes were blocked with 1 % BSA or 5 % of milk ( wt / vol ) in Tris - buffered saline – Tween 20 ( TBS - T ; 20 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 % [ vol / vol ] Tween 20 , pH 7 . 6 ) , for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated , overnight at 4°C , with the primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution . Then , the membranes were washed three times with TBS - T for 10 min and incubated with the respective HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution , for 1 h at room temperature . Lastly , the proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence with Clarity Western ECL substrate ( Bio - Rad ) using ImageQuant LAS 500 ( GE Healthcare ) . The images were quantified using Image Lab 6 . 0 . 1 software from BioRad . Cell viability After infection , macrophages were stained with annexin V following the manufacturer’s recommendation and analyzed by flow cytometry . Cell populations were divided by live cells [ cells negative for annexin V and propidium iodide ( PI ) ] , early apoptosis ( cells positive for annexin V ) , late apoptosis ( cells positive for annexin V and PI ) , and necrotic cells ( cells only positive to PI ) . These analyses were performed using FlowJo software . Statistical analysis All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism Software ( version 6 . 01 ) . The legends of the figures describe the exact number of independent experiences that were analyzed in each experiment . Results were presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . Statistical significance was determined using the t - test , one - way or two - way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparison test , respectively , with a P < 0 . 05 , considered statistically significant .
