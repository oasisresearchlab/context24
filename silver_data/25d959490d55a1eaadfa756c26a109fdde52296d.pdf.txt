The first is associated with coated pit matura - tion ; the second , with fission of the membrane neck of a coated pit . Using gene - edited cells that express dynamin2 - EGFP instead of dynamin2 and live - cell TIRF imaging with single - mol - ecule EGFP sensitivity and high temporal resolution , we detected the arrival of dynamin at coated pits and defined dynamin dimers as the preferred assembly unit . We also used live - cell spinning - disk confocal microscopy calibrated by single - molecule EGFP detection to deter - mine the number of dynamins recruited to the coated pits . A large fraction of budding coated pits recruit between 26 and 40 dynamins ( between 1 and 1 . 5 helical turns of a dynamin collar ) during the recruitment phase associated with neck fission ; 26 are enough for coated vesicle release in cells partially depleted of dynamin by RNA interference . We discuss how these re - sults restrict models for the mechanism of dynamin - mediated membrane scission . INTRODUCTION During clathrin - mediated endocytosis , regulated recruitment of clathrin and its associated proteins leads to assembly of a scaffold that molds a small patch of plasma membrane into an invaginated , clathrin - coated pit ( Brett and Traub , 2006 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Jackson et al . , 2012b ; Kirchhausen et al . , 2014 ) . These struc - tures capture membrane - bound cargo and pinch off to form clathrin - coated vesicles . Prompt uncoating yields vesicular carriers , which can deliver cargo to endosomes or other membrane - bound organelles . Coated - vesicle budding requires members of the dynamin fam - ily of large GTPases ( Koenig et al . , 1989 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ; Ferguson et al . , 2007 ) , of which human cells have three very similar isoforms , dynamins1 – 3 ( Cook et al . , 1996 ; Urrutia et al . , 1997 ; Brett and Traub , 2006 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Jackson et al . , 2012a ; Kirchhausen et al . , 2014 ) . Dynamin2 is expressed in all cell types ; dynamin1 is restricted to neurons ; and dynamin3 is found in neurons , lungs , and testes . Assembling coated pits recruit these proteins in two phases ( Koenig et al . , 1989 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ; Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ; Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Taylor et al . , 2012 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . The first phase , which accompanies the early stages of coated pit for - mation , appears to regulate coated pit maturation by as - yet - unde - fined mechanisms ( Macia et al . , 2006 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . The sec - ond phase , which generally appears as a “burst” immediately before membrane scission , is necessary for fission of the mem - brane neck connecting the nascent vesicle with the parent mem - brane ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 , 2012 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . Dynamins have an N - terminal GTPase “head , ” similar in structure to Ras - like small GTPases , connected to a long , primarily α - helical stalk ( Chappie et al . , 2009 ; Chappie and Dyda , 2013 ; Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . The stalk , which has a membrane - interact - ing PH domain at its tip , doubles back , so that the C - terminus of the polypeptide chain contacts the head . In solution , dynamin dimerizes readily ; the dimers associate into tetramers at higher concentrations . Crystal structures and cryo – electron microscopic ( cryo - EM ) recon - structions suggest that two sets of dimer contacts are critical for polymer assembly ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ) .

Cocucci et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell collar , with attendant distortion of the mem - brane ( Warnock et al . , 1996 ; Smirnova et al . , 1999 ; Stowell et al . , 1999 ; Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ; Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) . The inner diameter of the membrane tubule around which dynamin in the GMPPCP state assembles , with ∼ 26 dynamins per turn of a single - start helix , is ∼ 7 nm ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Figure 1 ) . Models of membrane fission sug - gest that the inner diameter of a constriction must contract to ∼ 3 nm for a spontaneous hemifission intermediate to form ( Kozlovsky and Kozlov , 2003 ; Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ; Morlot et al . , 2012 ; Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ) . It thus remains puzzling how the proposed powerstroke that attends passage to the transition state of the GTPase might couple to a local contraction of the enclosed membrane . An estimate of the minimum number of dynamin molecules required for scission constrains models for how the dynamin powerstroke might couple to change in membrane curvature . We report here mea - surements that yield such a count . We ap - plied an experimental design essentially similar to the one we developed to define molecular events associ - ated with the initiation of coated pits ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . The ba - sic principles are use of gene - edited cells , so that the relevant mol - ecule ( dynamin in the present case ) with an encoded fluorescent tag ( enhanced green fluorescent protein [ EGFP ] ) is present in physiolog - ical quantities , undiluted by untagged copies , and use of total inter - nal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) illumination to minimize back - ground and allow single - EGFP sensitivity ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) or intensity - calibrated spinning - disk confocal fluorescence microscopy for molecule counting ( Kural et al . , 2012 ) . We find that a dynamin dimer is the basic assembly unit , as re - cruitment proceeds in steps of 2 dynamins ( never 1 ) . Accumulation of ∼ 26 dynamins ( one turn of the dynamin - GMPPCP helix ) is suffi - cient under some conditions to produce membrane scission ; rarely do we see more than twice that amount . That is , one turn of the basic helix is enough , and two complete turns are not essential . A publication that appeared while this work was in review reported a broadly similar result , also using gene - edited cells : the authors of that study detected a minimum of 26 dynamins at the time of scis - sion , although they often found twice that amount ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . Because nucleotide - mediated dimer contacts between GTPase head domains bridge successive helical turns , the measure - ments have strong implications for models to explain how GTP hy - drolysis drives membrane fission . In particular , our results are not consistent with models invoking isotropic contraction of a continu - ous dynamin collar , as that category of mechanism requires a full turn of GTPase contacts and therefore two full turns of the basic helix . They appear instead to favor models that invoke a GTPase - driven twist , in which contraction of the diameter of a collar comes from a reduction in the number of dynamin dimers per turn . RESULTS Gene - edited cells expressing dynamin2 - EGFP To study the molecular events associated with dynamin - mediated membrane fission at the neck of clathrin - coated pits , we established a gene - edited cell line in which we replaced the ubiquitous GTPase domains projecting away from the midplane of the X . The PH domains are flexibly tethered at the other end of each stalk ( Figure 1 ) . GTPase – GTPase contacts generate a second twofold re - lationship between two of the stalk dimers just described . The two contacts produce a repeating , helical polymer ( Figure 1 ) , with the midplane of the X normal to the helix axis . GTP , which binds near the GTPase dimer interface , stabilizes the dimer contact , and formation of the interface greatly increases the rate of nucleotide hydrolysis . The GTPase - proximal segment of the stalk , a helical bundle some - times called the “bundle signaling element” ( BSE ; Chappie et al . , 2009 , 2010 ) , responds through the “switch 1” element of the GTPase to the occupancy of the nucleotide - binding site . Structures that in - clude both the GTPase and the BSE show that the latter has one conformation ( relative to the Ras - like domain ) in the GTP - bound state ( as represented by the nonhydrolyzable analogue , GMPPCP ) and a quite different one in the transition state ( as represented by GDP - AlF 4 − ) . The latter is essentially the same as in the GDP - bound and unliganded states . Assuming these properties to carry over to the intact molecule assembled around a membrane neck or tube , one can infer that GTP loading primes the molecule for a powerstroke that occurs at the transition state of the hydrolysis mechanism . Dynamins assemble in vitro around membrane tubules , forming helical structures in which stem – stem dimer contacts , closely related to those in the crystals , contribute to the principal helical path . GTPase – GTPase dimer contacts bridge adjacent helical turns ( Figure 1 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ; Chappie et al . , 2011 ) . These in vitro assemblies probably correspond to a dynamin “collar” at the neck of a budding coated pit or at the con - striction of an in vitro membrane tubule created by assembly of a dynamin sheath ( Morlot and Roux , 2013 ) . The link to the constricted membrane bilayer is through the dynamin PH domain at the tip of each stalk . The coupling of GTP hydrolysis with conformational changes in the BSE alters the orientation of the stalk and can in principle change the diameter and helical pitch of the collar . Early models for membrane scission driven by GTP hydrolysis postulated a concerted change in diameter of the helical sheath or FIGURE 1 : Rigid - body fit of the x - ray crystallographic atomic model of dynamin to the density from the cryo - EM image reconstruction .

The ribbon diagram shows an X - shaped dynamin dimer , with the GTPase domains projecting away from the midplane of the X and with the PRD at the carboxy - terminus removed ( PDB 3ZVR ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . The PH domains are flexibly tethered at the other end of each dynamin stalk . The dynamin atomic model was inserted into the dynamin helix cryo - EM density map using Chimera ( Goddard et al . , 2007 ) , with Figure 5 in Chappie et al . ( 2011 ) as a guide .

We chose to connect EGFP with a linker of six amino acids to the C - terminus of dynamin2 ( Figure 2A ) . We isolated clone SUM - Dyn2 , bearing the insertion at both alleles . Analysis of the genomic DNA by PCR showed that both alleles were dynamin2 with a dynamin2 - EGFP chimera . We selected the human cell line SUM159 ( Forozan et al . , 1999 ) , breast cancer – derived , mostly diploid cells , and used transcription activator - like effector nuclease ( TALEN ) – mediated editing to create the chimera - encoding FIGURE 2 : Gene editing of SUM cells to express dynamin2 - EGFP . ( A ) Schematic representation of the gene - editing strategy used with SUM159 cells to incorporate EGFP to the C - terminus of dynamin2 based on the TALEN approach ( Sanjana et al . , 2012 ) . The portions of the genomic DNA highlighted in red correspond to the sequences recognized by the DNA - binding domains constructed and then fused to two different copies of the Fok1 endonuclease ; the stop codon TAG indicates the site of EGFP incorporation . The resulting sequence joined by a short linker between the C - terminus of dynamin2 and N - terminus of EGFP is indicated .

Quantification of band intensities indicates that in SUM - Dyn2 , ∼ 2 % of expressed dynamin2 lacks EGFP ( 98 % substitution ) and ∼ 5 % of dynamin1 in the total pool of dynamin1 , dynamin2 , and dynamin2 - EGFP . Similar results were obtained with a different Western blot from a second cell lysate ( unpublished data ) . ( D ) Expression of dynamin2 - EGFP does not affect the receptor - mediated endocytosis of transferrin . The endocytosis of fluorescently tagged Alexa 647 transferrin was determined using a flow cytometry – based assay . Cells were first incubated with Alexa 647 – transferrin for 10 min at 4°C or 10 min at 37°C and then subjected to an acid wash in ice - cold medium to remove the transferrin bound to the cell surface .

Cocucci et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell interfere with the uptake of transferrin ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) . These obser - vations show that addition of EGFP to the C - terminus of dynamin2 does not interfere with its ability to promote coated - vesicle budding . Times series acquired by live - cell , spinning - disk , confocal micros - copy from the bottom surface of SUM - Dyn2 cells expressing rat clathrin light chain a ( LCa ) fused to mCherry ( mCherry - LCa ; Figure 2E ) or of hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells gene edited to express dynamin2 - EGFP and human clathrin LCa – red fluorescent protein ( RFP ; Figure 3C ) confirmed the expected presence of structures containing both fluorescent clathrin and dynamin . Most of these were dynamic spots corresponding to canonical coated pits ; a minority were long - lived coated plaques . The remaining fluorescent spots contained only clathrin ; these were the very mobile structures associated with en - dosomal membranes ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Kural et al . , 2012 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . We restricted most of the analysis of dynamin pre - sented here to its recruitment at canonical coated pits . Estimate of the number of dynamin molecules accumulated at the time of membrane fission Observations in several laboratories have led to the conclusion that fission at the membrane neck of a coated pit and release of a coated vesicle from the plasma membrane coincide with a peak in dynamin recruitment ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 , 2012 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ) , but direct information concerning the number of dynamin molecules that contribute to this peak has been lacking . From in vitro studies , it has been proposed that a two - rung helical collar is the minimal membrane fission unit , with two to three rungs mediating ∼ 80 % of the fission events ( Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ) . This model implies that ∼ 50 dynamin molecules will have ac - cumulated at the time of fission , since one rung in the constricted , GTP - bound conformation contains ∼ 13 . 3 dynamin dimers . Other models might require fewer dynamins ( Ford et al . , 2011 ) . We carried out a primary selection of objects containing fluores - cent dynamin and clathrin using the cmeAnalysis software with clath - rin as the “master” and dynamin as the “slave” ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) ; we then picked manually from the automated primary selections those objects whose clathrin fluorescent signal followed the ex - pected continuous growth associated with canonical coated pits ( see Materials and Methods and representative traces in Figure 4 ) . This selection was important because the clathrin signal was not strong enough for reliable automated selection , and the software often in - correctly classified tracks of coated pits as abortive rather than ca - nonical or incorrectly combined into a single event two or more pits that formed sequentially at a single location ( a “hot spot” ) . We followed in SUM - Dyn2 cells the recruitment of dynamin2 - EGFP during the full lifetime of the selected coated pits and deter - mined the number of molecules recruited , using spinning - disk con - focal microscopy , calibrated for fluorescence intensity , as described in our previous work ( Kural et al . , 2012 ) . We used this strategy in - stead of TIRF because spinning - disk confocal imaging is less sensi - tive to position along the z - axis , thereby ensuring full capture of the signal within the diffraction - limited geometry . We used SUM - Dyn2 cells stably expressing mCherry - LCa , and used alternate wavelength excitation and detection of both fluorophores with 30 - ms exposures to follow recruitment of clathrin and dynamin at the same position . We collected data from the bottom surfaces of the cells using time series lasting 5 min acquired every second and analyzed the dynam - ics of dynamin2 - EGFP recruitment from 426 clathrin - coated struc - tures in five different cells . In agreement with earlier results ( Figure 2D ; Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ; Doyon et al . , 2011 ; indeed substituted and that there was no DNA encoding wild - type dynamin2 ( Figure 2B ) . Consistent with this result , Western blot anal - ysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for dynamin2 showed ∼ 98 % substitution of dynamin2 by the expressed dynamin2 - EGFP ( Figure 2C ) . A different linker , used previously to express dynamin2 - EGFP in the gene - edited SK - MEL - 2 cell line hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN ( Figure 3A ) , does appear to be susceptible to proteolysis , as the apparent level of substitution is only ∼ 50 % ( Figure 3B ; Doyon et al . , 2011 ) , and these cells also have free EGFP ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ; unpublished data ) . Western blot analysis with a monoclonal anti - body specific for dynamin1 showed a very low level of dynamin1 in the SUM - Dyn2 cells ( ∼ 5 % of dynamin2 - EGFP ) and undetectable lev - els in the hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells . We verified that the endocytic efficiency of the clathrin machin - ery was normal in the SUM - Dyn2 cells . We found no difference be - tween control and gene - edited cells in receptor - mediated uptake of fluorescently tagged transferrin - A647 , using flow cytometry to mea - sure endocytic uptake ( Figure 2D ) . This result is consistent with ear - lier observations in conditional null mouse fibroblast cells , showing that ectopic expression of dyn2 - EGFP ( with a different linker ) did not FIGURE 3 : Characterization of hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells expressing dynamin2 - EGFP . ( A ) PCR analysis confirms published results ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ) showing the biallelic integration of EGFP to the dynamin2 in the clonal cell line named hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN gene - edited to express dynamin2 - EGFP and LCa - RFP ; SK - MEL - 2 denotes the parental cell line . ( B ) Western blot analysis of cell lysates from brain or from hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells expressing dynamin2 - EGFP probed with antibodies specific for dynamin1 or dynamin2 .

Similar results were reported re - cently using the gene - edited hCLTA EN / DN - M2 EN and DNM2 EN cells ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . In view of the complete substitution in our cells and the very small proportion of dynamin 1 , we used the maximum intensity of the total dynamin accumulation to deter - mine the number of molecules recruited at the time of membrane scission . The distri - bution peaked at ∼ 40 dynamins and aver - aged at 50 ± 19 molecules ( Figure 5A ) . Nearly 25 % of the events contained be - tween 26 and 40 dynamins , and ∼ 27 % of the events , between 40 and 52 dynamins ( Figure 5B ) . We do not know whether the gradually accumulated dynamin contributes to scis - sion . To estimate the number of dynamins specifically recruited during the burst phase , we subtracted the maximum fluorescence from the plateau 10 s before the peak of the burst . The values plotted , as a histogram and as a cumulative distribution in Figure 5 , C and D , showed a peak at 26 – 28 dynamins with an average of 33 ± 14 dynamins . In the low - intensity , abortive pits ( events lasting < 25 s ) , we saw no dynamin burst and de - tected only small and variable amounts of phase one dynamin recruitment ( Figure 5 , E and F ) . We obtained similar results from hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells ( Figure 6 ) . Because substitution of dynamin2 by dynamin2 - EGFP was only 50 % in those cells , the agree - ment supports the assumption of random incorporation of tagged and untagged dy - namin molecules in a ratio depending only on their relative concentrations in the cytosol . Effects of higher and lower membrane tension Scission of dynamin - coated membrane tu - bules in vitro requires that the tubule be un - der longitudinal tension ( Roux et al . , 2006 ; Morlot and Roux , 2013 ; Morlot et al . , 2012 ; Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ; Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ) . We examined the effect of mem - brane tension on the number of dynamin molecules that have accumulated at the time of coated vesicle release in SUM - Dyn2 cells expressing mCherry - LCa . Lowering plasma membrane tension by acute expo - sure to hyperosmotic medium inhibits coated vesicle formation ( and the associated endocytosis of cargo ; Heuser and Anderson , 1989 ; Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . Introduction of hyperosmolar medium ( lowering membrane tension ) caused the to - tal number of dynamins to increase ( Figure 7 , A and B ) , suggesting that a flaccid membrane needs more dynamin to rupture than does a tense one . Nonetheless , cells incubated in hypo - osmotic medium ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) and thereby subjected to a higher plasma Taylor et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) , most ( > 90 % ) of the dynamin2 - EGFP spots at the membrane colocalized with mCherry - LCa . Dynamin was gen - erally recruited in two phases , also as previously described , although the distinction was not always as marked as in hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells . In the first phase , which occurs during early stages of clathrin coat assembly , dynamin accumulated gradually to a plateau of vari - able magnitude . The second phase was the characteristic burst at FIGURE 4 : Representative traces of clathrin - coated pits forming in SUM - Dyn2 cells .

Accordingly , we found that dynamin depletion in SUM - Dyn2 cells by RNA inter - ference ( RNAi ) treatment for 5 d hindered clathrin - dependent uptake of transferrin ( Figure 8A ) . We inferred that depletion was incomplete because the fluorescence inten - sity of dynamin2 - EGFP remaining in the cy - tosol was 25 ± 10 % ( average ± SD , 10 cells ) and because a small fraction of dynamic pits remained that contained both clathrin and dynamin2 - EGFP . Under these conditions of partial depletion , we asked what would be the number of dynamins required for coated - vesicle budding . We analyzed 97 events in 10 cells and found that ∼ 50 % of the budding coated pits had no detectable recruitment during the first phase and on average recruited 28 ± 10 dynamins ( Figure 8 , B and C ) ; the distribution of the total number of dynamins at the time of pinching ( Figure 8 , D and E ) averaged at 32 ± 13 mol - ecules . The results suggest that a very small number of dynamins in the first phase of re - cruitment is enough to allow the pit to ma - ture and that 26 – 28 dynamins ( one rung ) are sufficient for membrane scission . Preferential recruitment of dynamin dimers to coated pits Using a TIRF configuration calibrated from single - molecule counting as previously de - scribed ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) , we followed the accumulation of dynamin2 - EGFP into coated pits at the bottom surface of SUM - Dyn2 cells . We acquired a rapid time series lasting ∼ 20 s , with 60 - ms exposure / frame at an interval of 110 ms . This protocol mini - mized photobleaching to not more than 20 % toward the end of the time series . We analyzed 23 traces from five cells selected to have relatively low amplitude and therefore show phase 1 of dynamin recruitment . We found consecutive stepwise intensity increments of variable magni - tude and a dwell time of 1 . 06 ± 0 . 57 s ( Figure 9A ) . The number of dynamin2 - EGFP molecules recruited during each of the steps was obtained by fitting the intensity distributions with different models that took into account the dynamin2 substitution by dynamin2 - EGFP ( 98 % ) and alternative contributions of monomer , dimer , te - tramer , and so on of dynamin2 - EGFP during the steps of recruit - ment ( see Materials and Methods ) . The model that gave the best fit , based on a Bayesian informa - tion criterion ( BIC ; Jaqaman and Danuser , 2006 ; see Materials and Methods ; Figure 9B ) had a dimer as the principal recruitment spe - cies , with events corresponding to addition of one ( 8 % ) , two ( 49 % ) , four ( 26 % ) , six ( 6 % ) , and eight ( 11 % ) dynamin molecules . The fit was performed using the ratio of dynamin2 - EGFP to untagged dy - namin of 49 : 1 , corresponding to the experimental value from West - ern blot analysis of a large pool of cells ( Figure 2C ) . We found very poor fits with calculations that assumed significantly different re - cruitment models ( Figure 9B ) . We conclude that a dimer is the prin - cipal species that incorporates into a coated pit ; we detected some membrane tension accumulated approximately the same number as did control cells ( Figure 7 , B – F ) . Thus there appears to be a threshold requirement for membrane scission , even when tension is unphysiologically high . The results also showed greater number of persistent clathrin - coated structures in cells treated with hyperosmotic medium ( n = 1746 , from five cells ) than in cells treated with hypo - osmotic medium ( n = 312 , from five cells ) or kept in iso - osmotic conditions ( n = 260 , from five cells ) , consistent with the known inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Heuser and Anderson , 1989 ; Morlot et al . , 2012 ) associated with accumulation of clathrin - coated micro cages at the plasma membrane ( Heuser and Anderson , 1989 ) in - duced by transient hyperosmotic treatment . We detected a variable number of dynamins ; the amount often fluctuates , without associ - ated pinching ( unpublished data ) .

There was no relationship be - tween the number of accumulated dynamins and the lifetime of the pits . Our analysis , based on data representing > 426 pits in five SUM159 ( SUM - Dyn2 ) and 337 pits in three SK - MEL - 2 ( hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN ) cells edited in both alleles of dynamin2 to express dy - namin2 - EGFP , showed a continuous distri - bution in the amount of dynamin recruited at the time of budding . Data obtained from a significantly smaller set ( 40 pits in three DNM2 EN cells gene - edited in both alleles of dynamin2 to express dynamin2 - EGFP ) sug - gested that the recruitment of dynamin was quantized at the time of budding , with an average of 24 dynamins in 50 % of the pits , an average of 44 dynamins in 39 % of the pits , and 77 dynamins in the remaining 9 % ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . We believe that the apparently quantized recruitment is a result of the very small size of the data set , as we found a continuous distribution from a sig - nificantly larger data set obtained with the same parental cells ( Figure 6 ) . In cells depleted of dynamin by RNAi , the distribution peaks at 26 – 28 , with the burst accounting for nearly all of the re - cruited dynamin . These results , when com - bined with published biochemical data , are at odds with models in which the forces driv - ing membrane fission come from concerted conformational changes in a dynamin collar based on the single - start helix generated by in vitro assembly ( Warnock et al . , 1996 ; Smirnova et al . , 1999 ; Stow - ell et al . , 1999 ; Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ; Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) ; they favor instead a role for GTP hydrolysis and conforma - tional change at or near the leading edge of a helical dynamin as - sembly ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ; Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ) . It is possible that the long - term depletion of dynamin2 by the small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) treatment might increase the expression of other proteins with compensatory activity for membrane scission , thereby reducing the dependence on dynamin . A compensatory fission activity was observed in vitro using tubular lipid templates exposed to dynamin and nonphysiological amounts ( micromolar ) of BAR domain – con - taining proteins , which presumably drove membrane tubulation ( Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . In vivo , where neck formation is driven primarily by the assembly of the clathrin coat , most of the budding coated pits detected in the dynamin2 - depleted cells re - cruited 26 – 28 dynamin2 molecules , the same as the threshold value observed for pits in cells expressing normal amounts of dynamin2 . Thus we believe that a compensatory mechanism is unlikely to have affected the number of dynamin2 molecules recruited under condi - tions of siRNA treatment . A dynamin dimer is the preferred assembly unit In vitro measurements using chemical cross - linking or sedimentation equilibrium show that soluble dynamin is an equilibrium mixture of monomers , dimers , and tetramers ( Binns et al . , 1999 ) , with a pre - ponderance of dimers at 60 nM ( Tuma and Collins , 1995 ) and of te - tramers at 1 μM ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Muhlberg et al . , 1997 ; Ramachandran et al . , 2009 ) . We do not have a measurement of the steps of four , six , and eight within the 110 - ms time resolution of our measurements , but we interpret these as two , three , or four dimers associating in rapid succession . Because photobleaching set a limit of ∼ 20 s for our time series , we could not follow early and late stages of a single coated pit . Dynamin accumulation was very rapid for events with high fluorescence intensities , which presumably cor - responded to the burst phase , and we could not determine a step size with the available time resolution . We further conclude that monomers barely contribute and that there is no preference for a tetramer in the initial step . DISCUSSION Our analysis of dynamin recruitment during assembly of endocytic clathrin - coated pits yields two principal conclusions . First , dynamin dimers are the preferred assembly units . Second , accumulation of ∼ 26 dynamin molecules ( ∼ 13 dimers ) at the neck of a budding vesi - cle is enough to drive scission . A single turn of the helical sheath formed in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues thus ap - pears to be both necessary and sufficient for membrane fission . We resolved recruitment into an early , gradual phase , which par - allels growth of the clathrin coat , and a late , burst phase , which ac - companies scission of the coated vesicle neck . The burst invariably leads to uncoating of the budded vesicle . Recruitment is a succes - sion of consecutive steps—usually arrival together of 2 dynamins ( one dimer ) , less frequently of 4 , and rarely of > 4 . Infrequently , we detect arrival of monomers . The distribution of total accumulated dynamin molecules peaks at ∼ 40 ( 20 dimers ) , with a peak of ∼ 26 if we count just the burst . In essentially no cases do we detect more FIGURE 6 : Number of dynamin molecules recruited to coated pits at the time of membrane fission in hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells .

Cocucci et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Minimum number of dynamins in a productive burst The distribution of burst amplitudes , mea - sured in gene - edited hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells ( Figure 6 ) , with ∼ 50 % of dynamin2 re - taining its EGFP tag , and in gene - edited SUM - Dyn2 cells ( Figure 5 ) , with all of dy - namin2 tagged , shows that ∼ 30 – 40 % of the scission - producing events occur with a burst of 26 – 28 dynamin molecules , although some transfer of dynamins from the pool ac - cumulated during the gradual phase into the burst - producing structure will probably raise this estimate . These experiments were carried out in both cell types , with ∼ 50 % loss of the EGFP tag in one and negligible loss in the other , so the estimate of the size of the burst is independent of apparent substitu - tion level . Depletion of total dynamin by RNAi often reduced the plateau of the first phase to the level of background , and in those experiments , a substantial fraction ( 50 % ) of the events contained 26 – 30 dy - namins . These results indicate that about one turn of the single - start helix is sufficient to produce scission , whether or not dy - namins in the initial phase contribute . Biochemistry of dynamin GTP hydrolysis Two observations from the literature are rel - evant to any consideration of models for dynamin action . One shows a relatively modest degree of cooperativity , despite the apparent requirement for coordinated action of a large number of molecules . Thus several studies of GTP hydrolysis by assembled dynamin yield a Hill coefficient of ∼ 2 ( Tuma and Collins , 1994 ; Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . This result leads to the likely conclusion that GTP hydrolysis at the interface of two GTPase heads , each with an active site , is the only source of measurable cooperativity . The other relevant observation is the number of GTP hydrolysis events , ∼ 15 , needed to break a lipid tube under modest tension ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . Roughly seven or eight pairs of heads must engage to produce this number , or fewer if there is repeated use of one or more paired GTPases . Models for the scission mechanism What constraints on a picture of dynamin - generated scission do our data impose ? We consider the helical cryo - EM reconstruction of a GMPPCP - stabilized dynamin assembly as the most likely model for the initial state of a dynamin collar at the neck of a coated pit . Fit - ting models derived from x - ray crystal structures into the cryo - EM map ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ) shows that one turn of the prominent spiral of density on the outside of the tube contains between 13 and 14 dynamin dimers , with their GTPase heads projecting alter - nately in opposite directions along the helix axis . If dynamin assem - bly proceeds by successive addition of dimers along this helical path , head – head contacts ( and hence stimulated GTPase activity ) will begin to form only during assembly of the second turn of the single - start helix . More specifically , head – head contacts are be - tween dimers i and i + 12 . Our data then show that accumulation of even a small segment of the second turn can lead to scission . absolute abundance of dynamin in a cell , but assuming 0 . 05 % of total protein , we estimate that its concentration falls between these numbers . Consider as an example 400 pg of protein in a HeLa cell ; if 90 kDa is the mean molecular weight , then there is 10 − 14 mole / cell or 10 − 17 mole of dynamin at 0 . 05 % ; if the HeLa cell has a radius of 15 μm , then V ≈ 10 4 μm 3 or 10 – 5 μl , and concentration is ∼ 0 . 5 μM . As shown in Figure 9C , recruitment steps having amplitudes of two and four dynamins , respectively , were in a ratio of roughly 2 : 1 ; steps with larger amplitudes made up < 20 % of the total . We prob - ably failed to resolve some successive dimers ( or tetramers ) because of the sampling interval , limited by the 110 - ms time resolution of our configuration . The data do not , of course , specify the molecular contacts pres - ent in the dimeric species that predominates . We regard it as un - likely that the recruited dimer has a head – head contact . The rate of spontaneous GTP hydrolysis for dynamin in solution is ∼ 0 . 04 s − 1 ; the rate for assembled dynamin is at least 50 - to 100 - fold higher ( Warnock et al . , 1996 ; Binns et al . , 1999 ; Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . The latter presumably derives from the interdimer head – head contacts that develop when two ( or more ) dimers come together on the same membrane . Head – head contacts in solution would produce futile cycles of GTP hydrolysis . The interaction likely to form the dimeric assembly unit is an extensive twofold contact in the crystal structures of Δ PRD - dynamin1 ( Figure 1 ) . The contacts in both struc - tures ( rat and human ) are essentially identical , and the interacting amino acid residues are strictly conserved among all dynamins1 and 2 . This dimer fits well into the cryo - EM reconstruction of a GMPPCP - stabilized dynamin tube ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ; Figure 1 ) . FIGURE 7 : Effect of membrane tension on the number of dynamin molecules recruited to coated pits at the time of membrane fission .

Spontaneous hemifission is believed to require a radius of ∼ 3 nm ( Kozlovsky and Kozlov , 2003 ) . Conformational changes in a dynamin collar could produce such a contraction either by a rota - tion of the stalks toward a more radial orientation , forcing the PH domains inward while leaving the helical parameters of the outer layer more or less unchanged , or by a decrease in the number of dynamins per turn of the helix , reducing both its outer and inner diameter without changing the radial disposition of the stalks . These two alternatives correspond roughly to the models proposed by Chappie et al . ( 2011 ) and by Smirnova et al . ( 1999 ) and Faelber et al . ( 2011 ) . The former is , in its simplest form , an isotropic squeeze ( Figure 10A ) ; the latter , a circumferential twist ( Figure 10B and Sup - plemental Movies S1 – S3 ) . The isotropic contraction model requires nearly a full turn of paired GTPase domains—that is , nearly two turns of the basic helix . The circumferential twist model requires simply that the assembly reach a state in which one or more pairs of GTPase domains interact . Our data appear to favor the latter picture . A progressive , circumferential twist model is consistent with the properties of a mutation , Q40E , at the GTPase dimer interface ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) . The mutation has no effect on the basal GTPase activ - ity , and it does not prevent formation of a dynamin sheath , either in vitro or in vivo . It does , however , eliminate assembly - stimulated GTPase activity . When coassembled with wild - type dynamin , it has a strong , dominant - negative effect on membrane tubule fission in vitro but little dominant - negative effect on the wild - type , assembly - stimulated GTPase activity . Any process requiring a number of suc - cessive steps will be more sensitive to poisoning of any one of those steps than will a concerted process , which can generally bring along with it changes in any inactive but still compliant components . Thus we expect a progressive twist mechanism to be more sensitive to introduction of GTPase heads that cannot pair functionally with an - other GTPase one helical turn away than a concerted contractile mechanism . Any twist model for constriction must include a mechanism to prevent the membrane neck from expanding back against the dy - namin collar . That is , the collar must retain its integrity , even if one turn slides against another . Concerted GTPase activity through - out the region in which one turn overlaps the next could cause the structure to pass through a transition point in which weak GTPase domain contacts would allow the membrane and collar to spring back . Uncoordinated GTP hydrolysis implies that transient instability of one interturn contact will not disengage the entire assembly . Studies of dynamin activity on membrane tubules in vitro show that scission occurs at the edge of an extended dynamin sheath , where an abrupt change in membrane curvature alters the mem - brane elastic energy ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ; Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ) . A bead attached to the sheath rotates with respect to the membrane tubule , and measurements of the corresponding torque on the membrane indicate that the forces involved are strong enough to overcome the barrier to hemifission , the likely intermediate in a leak - age - free process ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ; Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . These observations imply a change in the helical parameters of the dy - namin assembly at the edge of the sheath , but they do not require a concerted change throughout its length . Indeed , the rate of tubule breakage is independent of sheath length , over a range from 150 nm to 10 μm , indicating that whatever conformational changes occur are probably confined to the edge ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . A mecha - nism in which GTP hydrolysis generates constriction by a motor - like mechanism , with one or more dynamin dimers at the edge of a At intracellular GTP concentrations , essentially all the free dy - namin will have GTP in the nucleotide - binding site . The duration of the dynamin burst in our experiments is < 10 s . The rate of assembly is therefore > 3 dimers / s—somewhat faster than the stimulated GTP hydrolysis rate ( ∼ 1 s − 1 ; i . e . , a lifetime of ∼ 2 s for a dimer loaded with two GTPs ) . Thus , if assembly follows the principal single - start helix in the GMPPCP sheath , part of a second turn can form before any of the contacting pairs of GTPase domains have hydrolyzed their bound nucleotides . The relatively low cooperativity of GTP hydroly - sis nonetheless implies that passage of two paired domains to a GDP - Pi bound state can probably occur at any time after they make contact . Agreement of the minimum number of dynamins required for scission with the minimum number needed to generate at least one head – head interaction is consistent with assembly along the principal helix .

The images of the dynamin - depleted cells illustrate absence of the intracellular punctuate pattern characteristic of endocytosed transferrin - A647 and decrease in the overall fluorescence signal of dynamin2 - EGFP .

J . Brugge ( Harvard Med - ical School , Boston , MA ) kindly provided the human SUM159 cells . The mammalian expression vector mCherry - LCa based on pm - Cherry ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) was made by fusing mCherry to the N - terminus of rat brain clathrin light chain A . Mouse monoclonal antibody against dynamin1 ( Clone D5 ; Oncogene Research Products , San Diego , CA ) , goat polyclonal an - tibody against dynamin2 ( C - 18 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) , and horseradish peroxidase – conjugated secondary antibodies ( GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , United Kingdom , or Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) were used for Western blot analysis . Biotinylated fibronectin was prepared by 1 - h incubation at room temperature of 0 . 2 μM fibronectin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) with 1 μM NHS - LC - Biotin ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) freshly made in phos - phate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , followed by overnight dialysis ( Slide - A - Lyzer , minidialysis unit ; size cutoff , 10 4 Da ; Thermo Scientific , Barrington , IL ) at 4°C against filtered PBS . Biotinylated fibronectin was stored at − 20°C in the presence of 20 % glycerol . sheath “walking” along those in the next turn , is analogous to a propagating dislocation at the edge of a two - dimensional crystal . Contacts between heads in the GTP - bound state ( represented by GMPPCP ) are weaker than those in the transition state ( represented by GDP - AlF 4 − ) ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ) , and the conformational change on passage of one or more paired heads from a substrate - bound conformation to a transition - state conformation might in principle drive a shift in register of the remaining pairs in the overlap region . Available structures do not yet allow us to decide on the plausibility of this sort of model—for example , whether the “swing” of the BSE could move one turn a reasonable distance with respect to another in a zone of partial overlap . A propagating dislocation model is nonetheless fully compatible with our finding that one complete turn of the dynamin helix will drive budding of a coated pit , because it suggests that the mechanism of scission at the edge of sheath is essentially the same as scission by a one - turn collar . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Human SK - MEL - 2 cells and the corresponding gene - edited hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells were a kind gift of D .

The quality of the fit increases with more - negative BIC values . The dynamin2 substitution by dynamin2 - EGFP was kept as a fixed parameter corresponding to the value estimated by Western blot analysis ( 98 % ) .

The PCR products were purified , mixed and used for overlap PCR amplification using primers F1 and R3 . The resulting 2300 - nucleotide product was introduced into pCR8 / GW TOPO by TA ligation cloning and verified by DNA sequencing . The sequence of the primers ( Integrated DNA Technologies , Coralville , IA ) was as follows : Dyn2 up F1 GAGCGTGTTTGCCAACAGTGACCTC Dyn2 up R1 GTCGAGCAGGGATGGCTCGGCT Dyn2 EGFP F2 GCCGAGCCATCCCTGCTCGACgatccaccg - gtcgccaccCTG Dyn2 EGFP R2 CCCGAGAGCACGCCCCCCTCGAGGCt - tacttgtacagctcgtccatg Dyn2 down F3 GGGGCGTGCTCTCGGG Dyn2 down R3 GAATACAGAGTGCAGGCACTTACAG SUM159 cells were cotransfected with 600 ng each of the up - stream and downstream targeting sequences and the pCR8 / GW vector containing the donor construct dissolved in a total volume of 250 μl of OptiMEM ( Life Technologies ) into which 5 . 4 μl of TransIT 2020 Transfection Reagent ( Mirus Bio , Madison , WI ) was then added for a 15 - min incubation at room temperature ; the transfection mix - ture was added dropwise to 1 . 5 × 10 5 SUM159 cells plated the day before in six - well plates containing 1 . 5 ml of complete medium . Identification of cells gene - edited in both alleles for dynamin2 - EGFP took ∼ 3 wk and was carried out by a combination of cell sort - ing as follows : transfected cells were transferred from the single six - well dish into a T175 dish and subjected to fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) upon reaching confluency ( ∼ 10 × 10 6 cells ) . FACS was carried out using a FACSAria 2 - SORP ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) instrument equipped with a 300 - mW , 488 - nm laser and a 70 - μm nozzle ; cells were detached by trypsinization , centrifuged briefly at 400 × g , resuspended in 2 ml of PBS , and filtered through a 40 - μm sterile cell strainer ( BD Biosciences ) . Approximately 10 4 of SUM159 cells ( 1 % ) showing a fluorescence signal significantly higher Chemicals were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich unless specified otherwise . Cell handling All cells were grown and imaged at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . SUM159 cells were grown in DMEM / F12 / Glutamax ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) , supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 100 U / ml penicillin and streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) , 1 μg / ml hydrocortisone ( H - 4001 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , 5 μg / ml insulin ( 128 - 100 ; Cell Applications , San Diego , CA ) , and 10 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) , pH 7 . 4 . Sum - Dyn2 cells stably expressing mCherry - LCa were obtained by transfection . hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells were grown in DMEM / F12 / Glutamax sup - plemented with 10 % FBS and 100 U / ml penicillin and streptomycin . Cells ( 2 ml of medium containing 4 × 10 4 cells ) were placed on top of a coverslip in a six - well plate and imaged 12 – 24 h after plating . Gene editing SUM159 cells were gene - edited to replace dynamin2 with dynamin2 fused at its C - terminus to EGFP using a TALEN - based protocol ( Sanjana et al . , 2012 ) . The upstream targeting sequence 5 ′ - TCCCT - GCTCGACTAGGCCTC - 3 ′ overlapped the dynamin2 TAG stop codon ( underlined ) , whereas the downstream targeting sequence 5 ′ - TGCGTGAGGCCCCCCCGAGA - 3 ′ was located 13 nucleotides downstream ( Figure 1A ) . The “donor construct” used as template for the homologous re - combination step was generated by fusion of two ∼ 800 - nucleotide fragments of genomic DNA upstream and downstream of the stop codon of dynamin2 and the open reading frame of EGFP into the pCR8 / GW TOPO vector ( Life Technologies ) . The genomic frag - ments were obtained using two independent PCR amplification re - actions from DNA extracted from SUM159 cells using the QiaAmp DNA mini kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) ; the fragments obtained with primers F1 - R1 and F3 - R3 spanned ∼ 800 nucleotides upstream and 800 nucleotides downstream of the dynamin2 stop codon . The open reading frame encoding EGFP was obtained by PCR using FIGURE 10 : Proposed models for dynamin - mediated scission . ( A ) Isotropic contraction model requiring close to two turns of the basic helix . Consecutive cycles of GTPase activation between domains phasing opposing rungs provide the power stroke that ultimately compresses the spiral to reach conditions of membrane hemifission and eventual membrane scission . ( Adapted from Faelber et al . , 2011 . ) ( B ) Circumferential twist model proposed in this study , in which two dimers at the leading edge of a dynamin rung interact through their opposing GTPase domains ( yellow ) . Activation of the GTPase activity induces a local conformational change—in effect , a power stroke that locally tightens the approaching ends of the assembled rung . To this effect , arrival of a dynamin dimer ( green ) to one of the rung ends ( yellow ) results in the GTPase activation and conformational change of the opposing domains ( green and red ) associated with the next power stroke . A limited number of such sequential additions would be sufficient to tighten the rung , eventually leading to membrane hemifission and membrane scission . 3606 | E . Cocucci et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell acid wash using the 633 - nm laser line of the FASCSCanto2 ( BD Biosciences ) . Depletion of dynamin2 by siRNA treatment and selection of cells for visualization siRNA treatment of SUM - Dyn2 cells was carried out by transfection of cells grown in six - well plates to a density of 80 % . We used 20 nM siRNA ( Dharmacon , Fisher Scientific , Pittsburgh PA ) of sequence 5 ′ - GACAUGAUCCUGCAGUUCAUU - 3 ′ or a scrambled negative control for transfection with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Life Technol - ogies ) . The day after transfection , the cells were trypsinized and re - plated at ∼ 20 % confluency in six - well plates and allowed to grow for additional 3 d , after which ∼ 50 × 10 3 cells were plated onto cover - slips placed in a six - well plate and imaged 24 h later . Before imaging , the coverslip was placed for 10 min on a tem - perature - and humidity - controlled microscope stage containing 1 ml of prewarmed MEM α without phenol red ( Gibco , Langley , OK ) supplemented with 1 % FBS to allow temperature equilibration to 37°C . At this point , transferrin - A647 was added at 5 μg / ml and cells incubated for 7 min . Cells with normal or depleted levels of dynamin2 - EGFP were selected for imaging as follows : cells with normal levels of dynamin showed active coated - pit dynamics and accumulation of transferrin in endosomes ; cells depleted of dy - namin were impaired in coated - pit dynamics at the cell surface together with increased fluorescence intensity of the clathrin struc - tures , decrease of the cytosolic diffuse signal of dynamin2 - EGFP , and accumulation of fluorescence transferrin at the cell surface . Western blot analysis of dynamin2 levels in cells treated with siRNA was not deemed informative as a way to determine the overall ef - ficiency of dynamin2 depletion because < 10 % of the cells showed full loss of active pit dynamics and associated inhibition of transfer - rin uptake . Osmotic shock Cells were subjected to a brief , 10 - min incubation with iso - osmotic , hypo - osmotic , or hyper - osmotic medium , followed by acquisition in the same medium of a 200 - s time series using spinning - disk confo - cal microscopy consisting of 200 frames acquired every second . Hypo - osmotic medium was prepared by mixing one volume of MEM α without phenol red ( Gibco ) containing 1 % FBS with water also containing 1 % FBS . Hyper - osmotic medium was made by dis - solving sucrose to 0 . 25 M in MEM α without phenol red containing 1 % FBS . Live - cell imaging and fluorescence calibration Spinning - disk confocal fluorescence microscopy and TIRF micros - copy were done using Marianas - based systems ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver , CO ) . Both systems were controlled with Slide - Book V5 . 0 ( Intelligent Imaging ) operating under Windows 7 on a computer with 12 GB of RAM ( Dell , Round Rock , TX ) . The spinning - disk confocal microscopy system was based on a fully enclosed , en - vironmentally temperature controlled Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a 100 × / 1 . 4 numerical aperture objective ( Carl Zeiss Microimaging , Thornwood , NY ) , a CSU - 22 spinning - disk confocal head ( Yokogawa Electric , Tokyo , Japan ) modified with a photon ex - pansion Borealis upgrade ( Andor , Belfast , UK ) , and computer - con - trolled piezo - Z stage equipped with a linear X & Y encoder ( Applied Scientific Instruments , Eugene , OR ) . A 1 . 5 × magnification lens placed in front of the cooled electron multiplication charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( QuantEM 512SC ; Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) provided a final pixel size corresponding to 100 nm of image . The excitation was provided by solid - state lasers operating at than that of control nontransfected cells were sorted and grown to confluency in a T175 flask ; these cells were subjected to a second round of FACS , and ∼ 5 % ( those with the highest fluorescence signal ) were isolated , expended in a T175 flask , and frozen . Generation of clonal lines for cells gene - edited in both alleles for dynamin2 - EGFP expression was carried out by single - cell flow cytometry sorting in a 96 - well plates and then maintained in 12 - well plates and split 1 : 6 at the time they reached confluency . Identification of clone D3 , here - with named SUM - Dyn2 , with both alleles modified to express dy - namin2 - EGFP was done by genomic PCR amplification from ge - nomic DNA purified with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) using GoTaq Polymerase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and the forward 5 ′ - GT - CAAACAGCAGGCGAGTTG - 3 ′ and reverse 5 ′ - CAGCGTTAAGGAA - GAGGCCA - 3 ′ primers . These two primers map in the genomic se - quence of dynamin2 in the region close to the stop codon : the amplification wild - type dynamin2 corresponds to a 395 – base pair product , whereas insertion of EGFP results in a 1130 - nucleotide product . Expression of dynamin2 - EGFP instead of dynamin2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis . Glass coverslip preparation Glass coverslips ( # 1 . 5 ; Warner Instruments , Hamden , CT ) were cleaned and then coated with a copolymer of poly - l - lysine ( PLL ) and biotinylated poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ; Susos AG , Dübendorf , Switzerland ) as described ( Böcking et al . , 2011 ; Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . These PEG - modified coverslips were coated with fibronectin and used to plate cells imaged with TIRF microscopy . Clean coverslips without the PEG modification were used to plate cells imaged with spinning - disk fluorescence microscopy . Clean coverslips were also used to capture dynamin2 - EGFP molecules and then used to cali - brate the fluorescence intensity signal of single molecules of EGFP visualized by TIRF or spinning - disk fluorescence microscopy ; diluted cytosol containing dynamin2 - EGFP was placed on clean coverslips immediately after a 3 - min glow discharge period at 50 mA ( Electron Microscopy Science , Hatfield , PA ) . Cell extracts and Western blotting Cytosolic extracts were prepared from bovine brain ( Boll et al . , 1996 ) or from three 10 - cm dishes containing SUM - Dyn2 or hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells grown to confluency . Cells were washed three times in PBS and solubilized at 4°C for 5 min in 300 μl of 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 15 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraa - cetic acid , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Branford , CT ) ; nuclei were removed by low - speed centrifugation ( 800 × g , 5 min , 4°C , Centrifuge 5417R ; Eppendorf , Hauppauge , NY ) . Western blot analysis was carried out as described ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . Transferrin uptake by flow cytometry SUM159 cells , plated in 12 - well plates and grown to 80 % conflu - ency , were washed in PBS and incubated for 10 min with 5 μg / ml Transferrin - Alexa Fluor 647 ( transferrin - A647 ; Life Technologies ) at 4 or 37°C . After incubation , the plates were cooled on ice , rinsed with ice - chilled PBS , and briefly incubated or not twice with 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 125 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 1 M glycine , pH 2 . 5 , to remove the surface - bound transferrin - A647 . The cells were then re - suspended for 3 min at 37°C by treatment with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA ( Life Technologies ) , rinsed with 700 μl SUM media , and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS containing 1 % bovine serum albumin and 0 . 5 mM EDTA at 4°C . The amount of transferrin associated with each cell , reflecting the extent of endocytosis , was determined by flow cytom - etry as the mean fluorescence intensity of transferrin - A647 after the Volume 25 November 5 , 2014 Minimum fission dynamin machine | 3607 f k a n k q q [ ] ( 1 ) i i k n k i M 1 i ∑ =     − − = where q ( 98 % ) is the substitution probability derived from the West - ern blot data , n i is the maximum number of fluorophores for each value of i , and M is the maximum number of molecules included in the model for that step . From this distribution , the corresponding cumulative intensity distribution is calculated as ∑ µ σ = ⋅ + −         = F x f n x n n ( ) [ ] 12 1 erf ( ) 2 n n 1 max where n max is the maximum number of fluorophores in f [ k ] and μ and σ are the mean and SD of the intensity of a single molecule , respec - tively ; the values of μ and σ were obtained from the single - molecule dynamin2 - EGFP calibration . During the fit of F to the measured cu - mulative intensity distributions , the parameter a i was estimated for a given configuration of the assembly unit of dynamin ( e . g . , mono - mer , dimer , tetramer , hexamer , and octamer ) . Different models were created by the iterative addition of components to the simplest pos - sible initial description ( e . g . , one monomer is recruited during each step , or monomer is the only oligomeric state present in the cyto - sol ) . Selection of the best combination of models was based on the BIC used to prevent overfitting of the data ( Jaqaman and Danuser , 2006 ) . The BIC with the lowest value was the best descriptor of the data ; it defines an optimal trade - off between the likelihood of a model and the number of parameters used in the model descrip - tion . Its value decreased with the model likelihood and increased with the number of model parameters used to fit the data . Independent confirmation for the extent of substitution deter - mined by Western blot analysis from SUM - Dyn2 cell extracts was obtained by comparing mathematical models of different dynamin2 assembly units ( monomer , dimer , tetramer , combinations of dimers and tetramers , etc . ) and variable substitution with the experimental data from the SUM - Dyn2 cells used to determine the preferential assembly unit of dynamin ; the BIC was then used to search for the model that would best fit the experimental data . The amount of dynamin recruited to coated pits was determined in SUM - Dyn2 and hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN cells from data obtained by spinning - disk confocal fluorescence microscopy using the cmeAnal - ysis software with clathrin as the “master” and dynamin as the “slave” ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . Parameters used for the detector were Sigma , 1 . 1 , and Alpha , 0 . 05 ; valid tracking was constrained to ob - jects containing less than two gap lengths , at least five frames in length , and with < 3 - pixel shift between consecutive frames . Clathrin traces > 25 s in duration were binned as valid coated pits , whereas shorter ones were classified as abortive pits . Clathrin traces present during the full duration of the time series were classified as persis - tent coated plaques . Not included in the analysis were objects rap - idly appearing or disappearing and objects whose dynamics were truncated by the initiation of end of the time series . All objects re - ported in this study were validated by visual inspection ; this verifica - tion was necessary because the fluorescence signal elicited by mCherry - LCa or by LCa - RFP was not strong enough for reliable au - tomatic selection . The number of dynamin2 - EGFPs recruited to a coated - pit spot was obtained from the fluorescence intensity of dynamin2 - EGFP on the diffraction - limited spot calibrated by the mean intensity of single dynamin2 - EGFP obtained by the single - step photobleaching deter - mination . The number of recruited dynamin2 molecules was then calculated by taking into account the extent of substitution esti - mated by Western blot analysis ( 98 % in SUM - Dyn2 cells , 50 % in 491 , 561 ( Coherent , Santa Clara , CA ) , and 660 nm ( CrystaLaser , Reno , NV ) coupled to an acousto - optical tunable filter for rapid wavelength switching and power control ; images were acquired us - ing 525 / 50 , 620 / 60 , and 680 long - pass emission filters ( Semrock , Rochester , NY ) . The illumination power at the back aperture of the objective was 3 . 6 mW at 491 nm , 3 . 4 mW at 561 nm , and 1 . 7 mW at 660 nm . Time series were acquired every 1 s , with an exposure of 30 ms / frame unless otherwise indicated . The TIRF microscopy imaging system was as described ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) , except that the spherical aberration correction system was replaced by a 2 × magnification lens placed in front of the CCD camera , such that the final pixel size corresponded to 80 nm of im - age . The incidence angle of the excitation light on the coverslip was adjusted to generate an evanescent field with a penetration depth of ∼ 100 – 200 nm . The illumination power at the back aperture of the objective was 3 . 3 mW . Time series were acquired every 110 ms , with an exposure of 60 ms / frame . Glass coverslips with plated cells were washed with sterile PBS , placed in an Attofluor Cell Chamber ( Invitrogen ) , and layered with 1 ml of prewarmed MEM α without phenol red ( Gibco ) supple - mented with 1 % FBS . The chamber was then placed into a heated sample holder ( 20 / 20 Technology , Wilmington , NC ) placed inside the environmentally controlled chamber of each microscope . We used our previously developed imaging procedures and ana - lytical tools to confirm that we could detect the fluorescence from a single dynamin2 - EGFP ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Kural et al . , 2012 ) . Cyto - sol extracts from SUM - Dyn2 were used to determine the fluorescence intensity of a single molecule of EGFP by single - step photobleaching under conditions of continuous TIRF or spinning - disk fluorescence illumination ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Kural et al . , 2012 ) . The cytosol ex - tract was diluted ∼ 1000 times in PBS and then placed on top of a freshly glow - discharged glass coverslip for 5 min . The samples were subjected to continuous illumination , using 60 - ms or 2 - s exposure / frame for TIRF or spinning - disk confocal microscopy , respectively . The fluorescence intensity of diffraction - limited spots profiles was de - termined by summing the intensities in a 5 × 5 – pixel region centered on the spot subtracted from the local background ( TIRF ) or as the amplitude of the Gaussian fluorescence intensity profile obtained by applying a two - dimensional Gaussian - fitting function ( spinning disk ) . The fluorescence intensity traces were fitted using a step fitting func - tion ( Smith , 1998 ) . The distribution of fluorescence intensity loss as - sociated with a photobleaching step obeyed a normal distribution , and the mean of that distribution corresponded to fluorescence from a single EGFP ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . Image analysis The preferential assembly unit of cytosolic dynamin was determined in SUM - Dyn2 cells as described ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) by following the incorporation of dynamin2 - EGFP into coated pits using live - cell imaging data obtained by TIRF . The centroid of diffraction - limited spots was obtained using u - track software ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) with psfSigma , 1 ; integWindow , 1 ; alphaLocMax , 0 . 12 ; and numSigmaIter , 3 . Tracking was constrained to objects that remained for at least 15 consecutive frames ( ∼ 1 . 7 s ) and with gaps of < 5 frames . The selected traces persisted for 10 s or more and accumulated up to 23 ± 11 dynamin2 - EGFP ( mean ± SD ) . A step detection function ( Smith , 1998 ) was applied to each selected trace to obtain the num - ber of dynamins recruited per step and the associated dwell time . The probability of a particular number of molecules being pres - ent in the step ( e . g . , as ( dimer , tetramer , etc . ) is a i , such that a 1 i i ∑ = . The total expected distribution of EGFPs as a weighted sum of bi - nomial distributions for each step is 3608 | E . Cocucci et al .

The data are presented as histograms and as cumulative intensity distributions ; the estimated error associated with the determination of the number of dynamins shown in the cumulative intensity distribution plot corresponds to the range be - tween 5th and 95th percentiles of the data defined by convolving the binomial distribution function accounting for the extent of sub - stitution and the normal distribution of the fluorescence intensity of single dynamin2 - EGFPs . The total number of recruited dynamins is the number measured at the time the coated pit fully formed ; it represents the total accu - mulation due to the first and second recruitment phases . The num - ber of dynamins recruited during the second phase was calculated by subtracting the total fluorescence intensity from the average value obtained from three consecutive frames at 9 , 10 , and 11 s before the peak value at the end of coated - pit formation .
