Adaptive nonequilibrium design of actin - based metamaterials : fundamental and practical limits of control Shriram Chennakesavalu , Sreekanth K . Manikandan , Frank Hu , and Grant M . Rotskoﬀ ∗ Department of Chemistry , Stanford University , Stanford , CA , USA 94305 ( Dated : July 7 , 2023 ) The adaptive and surprising emergent properties of biological materials self - assembled in far - from - equilibrium environments serve as an inspiration for eﬀorts to design nanomaterials and their properties . In particular , controlling the conditions of self - assembly can modulate material prop - erties , but there is no systematic understanding of either how to parameterize this control or how controllable a given material can be . Here , we demonstrate that branched actin networks can be encoded with metamaterial properties by dynamically controlling the applied force under which they grow , and that the protocols can be selected using multi - task reinforcement learning . These actin networks have tunable responses over a large dynamic range depending on the chosen external protocol , providing a pathway to encoding “memory” within these structures . Interestingly , we show that encoding memory requires dissipation and the rate of encoding is constrained by the ﬂow of entropy—both physical and information theoretical . Taken together , these results emphasize the utility and necessity of nonequilibrium control for designing self - assembled nanostructures . I . INTRODUCTION Biomolecular materials spontaneously self - assemble in ﬂuctuating , nonequilibrium environ - ments . Despite this complex environment , many cellular assemblies possess a remarkable capacity for adaptation and dynamism [ 1 – 4 ] . In contrast , our ability to design materials with nanoscale components remains primitive in comparison with the intricate , hierarchical structures that reliably assemble in living systems [ 5 ] . The strategies employed by biological self - assembly thus oﬀer a unique lens into the limits of control for synthetic eﬀorts to engineer nanoscale metamaterials . Cytoskeletal networks are perhaps the most illus - trative example of the dramatic eﬀects of assembly dynamics on resulting material properties [ 6 , 7 ] . The key structural proteins that form this scaﬀolding of the cell must rapidly rearrange to drive fundamen - tal processes such as motility [ 8 ] and signalling [ 3 , 9 ] . The remarkable material properties and dynamical assembly of branched actin networks , which self - organize through the complex interplay between nu - merous proteins and external forces from the en - vironment , have attracted signiﬁcant experimental and theoretical scrutiny . The components of these dynamic networks have been puriﬁed , and reconsti - tuted systems have been studied extensively [ 7 , 10 – 13 ] , yielding detailed insight into their nonequilib - rium dynamics . Atomistic simulations and experimental studies have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms of actin polymerization and allostery [ 14 ] , branch - ing [ 15 ] , and plasticity [ 16 ] . In silico studies of ∗ rotskoﬀ @ stanford . edu mesoscale material properties of cytoskeletal net - works have , on the other hand , relied heavily on min - imal models [ 7 , 17 , 18 ] , that represent the network of actin ﬁlaments as elastic networks with ﬁlaments that resist bending and stretching . For example , randomly assembled networks have been shown to recapitulate interaction with the membrane [ 19 ] and myosin induced contraction [ 17 , 18 ] . Similarly , inter - esting dynamical behaviors like treadmilling [ 20 ] as well as aster formation and sorting in actin - myosin networks [ 21 , 22 ] have been captured accurately with simple models . The aforementioned works show the utility of a minimal modeling approach , and we fol - low suit . We develop a model that closely resem - bles the experimental geometry of a recent study that images branched actin network growth under load [ 10 , 13 ] . We show here that the model we have devel - oped captures the essential behavior of actin net - work growth under varying external loads and , ad - ditionally , we show how to control that behavior to tune the response properties of the resulting mate - rial . We demonstrate , in particular , that an external feedback protocol that dynamically modulates the growth conditions encodes a nonequilibrium mem - ory in the material . The deviation from a homo - geneous distribution of the molecular components leads to distinctive metamaterial properties , but re - ducing the system entropy relative to the homoge - neous state comes with an associated entropic cost . Using reinforcement learning , we optimize external , nonequilibrium protocols that drive the resulting networks into regimes inaccessible to uncontrolled assemblies . We further show that the resulting net - works have elastic coeﬃcients that depend strongly on the applied force . a r X i v : 230 6 . 10778v2 [ c ond - m a t . s t a t - m ec h ] 6 J u l 2023 2 II . ENCODING MATERIAL MEMORY WITH NONEQUILIBRIUM GROWTH DYNAMICS Mechanical response in soft materials is dictated by both intrinsic material properties of the con - stituents and also their spatial organization [ 23 , 24 ] . When the individual components of a structure can be manipulated in a spatially localized fashion , exquisitely precise control of the resulting material is sometimes possible [ 23 , 25 ] . However , in many materials , we can only reconﬁgure a ﬁxed set of com - ponents into distinct topologies . This motivates an exploration of the possibility of controlling mechan - ical response without manipulating the components themselves . For example , the reorganization of ﬁxed components in a network has been used to control global response by systematically removing a small set of bonds from disordered networks of springs [ 26 ] . Making metamaterials by manipulating a few degrees of freedom in a complex network indeed demonstrates the profound sensitivity of mechani - cal properties on spatial organization . However , in nanoscale systems self - assembled by stochastic dy - namics , surgical reconﬁguration is not possible ex - perimentally . Nevertheless , many biomolecular ma - terials have adaptive properties that evince mem - ory of their growth conditions [ 4 , 27 , 28 ] , which are ultimately nonequilibrium , kinetic eﬀects . Per - haps the most direct example of this behavior is the force - induced stress stiﬀening in branched actin net - works [ 11 , 12 , 29 ] which can be reversibly saturated to the point of softening [ 30 ] . When grown under high load forces , actin networks become more rigid than networks assembled in the absence of an ap - plied force , despite consisting of exactly the same protein components . The metamaterials that assemble under the ex - ternal control described in Sec . IV have a “mem - ory” of their growth process . In many works ex - amining nonequilibrium memory retrieval and mem - ory in self - assembly , the existence of a Hamiltonian with multiple metastable states is assumed [ 31 ] ; here we instead examine the question of the thermody - namic constraints on encoding memory and gener - alize this notion to non - Hamiltonian systems . This memory can be quantiﬁed by considering the devia - tion of the spatial distribution of components after the ﬁnite - time protocol 𝜌 𝑇 from a reference homoge - neous steady state distribution , denoted 𝜌 ss . A more structured distribution will have lower Shannon en - tropy 𝑆 sys ( 𝜌 ) ≡ − ∫ 𝜌 ( 𝒙 ) log 𝜌 ( 𝒙 ) 𝑑 𝒙 , setting 𝑘 B = 1 , so a time - dependent reduction of the system entropy constitutes encoding memory . Interestingly , the rate of memory encoding sat - isﬁes a universal “speed - limit” as a direct and straightforward consequence of the detailed Infor - mation Fluctuation Theorem [ 32 , 33 ] : − 𝜕 𝑡 𝑆 sys ( 𝜌 𝑇 ) ≤ (cid:104) 𝜎 env (cid:105) + (cid:164) 𝐼 [ 𝑿 𝑡 ; M 𝑡 ] , ( 1 ) where 𝜎 env is the rate of entropy production in the medium and the brackets (cid:104)·(cid:105) denote averages over trajectories . To see this , we employ the detailed ﬂuctuation theorem assuming that the material is growing under steady state conditions at time 𝑡 = 0 , which identiﬁes the total entropy production along a feedback controlled trajectory as 𝜔 [ 𝑿 𝑡 , M 𝑡 ] = log 𝜌 ss ( 𝑿 0 ) 𝜌 𝑇 ( 𝑿 𝑇 ) − 𝛽 Q [ 𝑿 𝑡 , M 𝑡 ] + I [ 𝑿 𝑡 ; M 𝑡 ] . ( 2 ) Due to the second law of thermodynamics , this quantity is non - negative in expectation , i . e . , 0 ≤ E 𝑿 𝑡 , M 𝑡 log 𝜌 ss ( 𝑿 0 ) 𝜌 𝑇 ( 𝑿 𝑇 ) − 𝛽 Q [ 𝑿 𝑡 , M 𝑡 ] + I [ 𝑿 𝑡 ; M 𝑡 ] ≤ Δ 𝑆 sys ( 𝜌 𝑇 , 𝜌 ss ) − 𝛽 (cid:104)Q(cid:105) + 𝐼 [ 𝑿 𝑡 ; M 𝑡 ] , ( 3 ) where the entropy term appears because the initial conditions are sampled from the steady - state distri - bution which diﬀers from the ﬁnal distribution and the average of the trajectory - wise information is the mutual information between the trajectory and the measurement sequence . This term vanishes when there is no feedback in the protocol . Because the to - tal heat ﬂow out of the system is time extensive , it is more useful to consider the time derivative of this inequality , which recovers ( 1 ) , using the fact that the steady state system entropy change is zero . The interpretation of this speed - limit is straight - forward : the rate at which the system can be driven to deviate from its steady - state behavior requires either a positive rate of dissipation of heat to the reservoir or a positive quantity of information must be extracted from the measurement sequence at each point in time . The entropy production rate for actin networks grown under feedback protocols is plotted as a function of protocol duration in Fig . S5 . In the special case of an equilibrium reference steady - state , this bound can be saturated because there is no steady - state entropy production ; note that if the reference process is dissipative in the steady state , this upper bound may not be tight . Bounds similar to ( 1 ) have appeared without the feedback term to quantify the cost to maintain a steady state [ 34 , 35 ] and as a constraint on number ﬂuctuations in self - assembled lattice gases [ 36 ] . While this upper bound may provide only a weak constraint in some cases , it emphasizes that ﬁnite - time memory encoding re - quires dissipation . The general thermodynamic constraint ( 1 ) implies that a ﬁnite dissipation rate is required to encode 3 < latexit sha1 _ base64 = " N0l8iwEH2XFG / OlwV7HdyJBzkJE = " > AAAGj3icfZRdb9MwFIa9wcoYXx1cchNRISGgazs + xs2mwTbEJi46WGmlplSO46ZWnTiznW5dlH / CLfwn / g12Gldzu3KkSEfPed8c58Q6XkyJkPX635XVW7fXSnfW727cu / / g4aPy5uMfgiUc4RZilPGOBwWmJMItSSTFnZhjGHoUt73Rga63x5gLwqIzOYlxL4RBRAYEQalQv1we9VOXh85HHm / X3mQ / X / XLlfpWPQ9nMWkUSQUU0exvrgWuz1AS4kgiCoXoNuqx7KWQS4IozjbcROAYohEMcFelEQyx6KX50TPnuSK + M2BcPZF0cnrdkcJQiEnoKWUI5VDM1zS8qdZN5OBDLyVRnEgcoWmjQUIdyRw9B8cnHCNJJyqBiBN1VgcNIYdIqmlZXfTBRIyR + hKBZQhJpEl3w1HRVH2dXafWEspVE0NOOAxR7bCYh6h9l1DJuV + TQxzi2uvc9ZUEUCYci90z3JmiVsxJMJSf9RB2HSyrHmOjKmchjKqM + lUhJxRXByTQtqnlWEJK0JzDJyKmcFIleXGZ9ZPiN9oFDonKlOs / zjlPLtf3zyiVsJeqafl44EZe6mqB / oeMplFWcD5kdkUTUxxDvlifQiNR45RwTpGza + + 4SWOwkS0qrhXnSjPu2dwzHNkcGX5u83PDT21 + aviJzU8MH9l8NBumzflsBjYfG35h8wvDL21 + afjE5hPDr2x + ZXjH5h3D2zZva36I1dLg + BvzEiEPWKguvK8uA4yy1GUx5lAyrlfGy1SzpQaRxPGCI4dLLZAHIVlsU + DlnUiwaMph8ZVHR6mr95G6JUdZlqNmc4aaWhbhCzQ7xjjIuo1e6lI8kC6FUUCxU2k4br4Q9CQCvUVVqNXcmF / Ei8mP7a3G + 613p28r + 3vFkl4HT8Ez8AI0wA7YB19AE7QAAmPwC / wGf0qbpZ3SXml / Kl1dKTxPgBWl43 + qq1NX < / latexit > k + Arp2 / 3 < latexit sha1 _ base64 = " XSIYxwVHzq2b0bbZhXbMR7vgTfM = " > AAAGinicfZTfbtMwFMa9wcoYAza45MaiQkJA13bir9DQxDYEExcdrKxSUybHcVOrTpzZTrcuynNwC4 / F22CncTW3K0eKdPQ735fjnFjHTxiVqtH4u7R84 + ZK5dbq7bU763fv3d / YfPBD8lRg0saccdHxkSSMxqStqGKkkwiCIp + RE3 + 4Z + onIyIk5fGxGiekF6Ewpn2KkdKoNzzNPBFBjJL85 / PTjWpjq1EEnE + aZVIFZbRON1dCL + A4jUisMENSdpuNRPUyJBTFjORrXipJgvAQhaSr0xhFRPay4tQ5fKJJAPtc6CdWsKBXHRmKpBxHvlZGSA3kbM3A62rdVPXf9jIaJ6kiMZ406qcMKg7NCGBABcGKjXWCsKD6rBAPkEBY6UE5XczBZEKw / hJJVIRobEh3Depo6b5wB9bbUrvqciCoQBGu75fzkPXvCmm5COpqQCJSf1G4vtIQqVQQuXNMOhPUTgQNB + qTGcIOJKrmcz6sCR6huMZZUJNqzEitT0Njm1i + KMQonnEEVCYMjWu0KC6yftT8WrskEdWZdv3HOeMp5ObqWaUW9jI9rYD0vdjPPCMw / 5CzLM5LLgbcrRhiiyMk5usTaCV6nArNKAp25R3XaSy2snnFleJMacp9l / uWY5djy89cfmb5kcuPLD90 + aHlQ5cPp8N0uZjOwOUjy89dfm75hcsvLB + 7fGz5pcsvLe + 4vGP5ictPDN8nemkI8o37qVR7PNIXPtCXAcV55vGECKS4MCvjWWbYQoNMk2TOUcCFFiTCiM63KfHiTjScNxWw / MqDg8wz + 0jfkoM8L1CrNUUtI4vJOZ4eYxTm3WYv8xjpK4 + hOGQEVpvQKxaCmURotqgOvZqbs4t4PvmxvdV8vfXq6GV190O5pFfBI / AYPAVN8Absgs + gBdoAgzPwC / wGfyrrle3Ku8r7iXR5qfQ8BE5U9v8B + yZShQ = = < / latexit > k + cap < latexit sha1 _ base64 = " YiZpdnqXr7VZ0n6ixpjNz8F828w = " > AAAGjnicfZTfbtMwFMazwcoYf9bBJTcRFRICurYIBjeFiW1oTFx0sNJKTakcx02tOnZmO926KE / CLTwUb4OdxtXcrhwp0tHvfF + Oc2IdPyZYyHr979r6rdsbpTubd7fu3X / wcLu88 + iHYAmHqA0ZYbzrA4EIpqgtsSSoG3MEIp + gjj8 + 0PXOBHGBGT2T0xj1IxBSPMQQSIUG5e3xIPV45AIoMc1 + vhyUK / Xdeh7uctIokopTRGuwsxF6AYNJhKiEBAjRa9Rj2U8BlxgSlG15iUAxgGMQop5KKYiQ6Kf5yTP3mSKBO2RcPVS6Ob3uSEEkxDTylTICciQWaxreVOslcvi + n2IaJxJROGs0TIgrmavH4AaYIyjJVCUAcqzO6sIR4GoMalhWF30wESOovkQgGQFMNeltuSpaqq / bdGttoVw1MeKYgwjWDot5iNp3CZScBzU5QhGqvcpdX3EIZMKRaJ6h7gy1Y47Dkfysh9B0kaz6jI2rnEWAVhkJqkJOCaoOcahtM8sXCQiGC44Ai5iAaRXnxVXWT4rfaBcowipTrv84Fzy5XF8 / o1TCfqqmFaChR / 3U0wL9DxlJaVZwPmJ2RRNTnAC + XJ9BI1HjlGBBkbNr77hJY7CRLSuuFRdKc + 7b3Dcc2hwafm7zc8NPbX5q + InNTwwf23w8H6bN + XwGNp8YfmHzC8MvbX5p + NTmU8OvbH5leNfmXcM7Nu9ofojU0uDoG / MTIQ9YpC58oC4DoFnqsRhxIBnXK + NFqtlKg0jieMmRw5UWwMMIL7cp8OpOOFw25bD4yqOj1NP7SN2SoyzLUas1Ry0to + gCzo8xCbNeo596BA2lRwANCXIrDdfLF4KeRKi3qAq1mhuLi3g5 + fF6t7G3 + / b0TWX / Q7GkN50nzlPnudNw3jn7zrHTctoOdBLnl / Pb + VMql / ZKzdLHmXR9rfA8dqwoHf8Dl3pTpQ = = < / latexit > k + a c t i n < latexit sha1 _ base64 = " eQdHopRn9tuQOEI + QkAsqgD3Jpw = " > AAAGjnicfZTfbtMwFMa9wcoYf9bBJTcRFRJCdG0RDG4KE9vQmLjoYF0rNaVyHDe16sSZ7XTrojwJt / BQvA12Gldzu3KkSEe / 8305zol1vJgSIev1v2vrd + 5ulO5t3t968PDR4 + 3yzpNzwRKOcBsxynjXgwJTEuG2JJLibswxDD2KO974QNc7E8wFYdGZnMa4H8IgIkOCoFRoUN4eD1KXhw5EkkTZz + qgXKnv1vNwlpNGkVRAEa3Bzkbg + gwlIY4kolCIXqMey34KuSSI4mzLTQSOIRrDAPdUGsEQi36anzxzXijiO0PG1RNJJ6c3HSkMhZiGnlKGUI7EYk3D22q9RA4 / 9FMSxYnEEZo1GibUkczRY3B8wjGSdKoSiDhRZ3XQCHI1BjUsq4s + mIgxUl8isAwhiTTpbTkqWqqv03RqbaFcNTHihMMQ1Q6LeYjaDwmVnPs1OcIhrr3OXd9IAGXCsWie4e4MtWNOgpH8oofQdLCseoyNq5yFMKoy6leFnFJcHZJA22aWrxJSghYcPhExhdMqyYurrJ8Vv9UucEhUplz / cS54crm + fkaphP1UTcvHQzfyUlcL9D9kNI2ygvMRsyuamOIE8uX6DBqJGqeEC4qc3XjHbRqDjWxZcaO4UJpzz + ae4cjmyPALm18YfmrzU8NPbH5i + Njm4 / kwbc7nM7D5xPBLm18afmXzK8OnNp8afm3za8O7Nu8a3rF5R / NDrJYGx9 + Zlwh5wEJ14X11GWCUpS6LMYeScb0yXqWarTSIJI6XHDlcaYE8CMlymwKv7kSCZVMOi688OkpdvY / ULTnKshy1WnPU0rIIX6L5MSZB1mv0U5fioXQpjAKKnUrDcfOFoCcR6C2qQq3mxuIiXk7O3 + w29nbfnb6t7H8slvQmeAaeg5egAd6DfXAMWqANEEjAL / Ab / CmVS3ulZunTTLq + VnieAitKx / 8Ao65Tpw = = < / latexit > k   a c t i n Actin Monomer Capping Protein Arp2 / 3 Barrier a ) b ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 l og 10 R n o d e ( !

External control of actin network enables design of actin - based metamaterials . a ) A schematic overview of branched actin networks growing against a barrier , where individual ﬁlaments can polymerize , depolymerize , branch ( via Arp2 / 3 ) or be capped . Network growth can be controlled by modulating load force 𝐹 . b ) Actin networks grown with layered density proﬁles ( top right and bottom left ) have heterogeneous responses , while networks grown with constant density proﬁles ( top left and bottom right ) have more homogenous responses . new properties in a material . Indeed , the large range of elasticities observed in branched actin networks that result only from changing the growth conditions raises an important general question : How tuneable is response with a given material assuming that a dissipative , feedback protocol is used to control as - sembly ? Here , we seek to answer this question using a minimal model of branched actin networks , de - scribed in detail in Sec . III . This model provides an attractive platform for our investigation because this system can be reconstituted using puriﬁed proteins and the growth conditions can be directly manipu - lated using the cantilever arm of an atomic force mi - croscope , as depicted in Fig . 1 . Our model captures the essential physical features of recent experiments reported in Ref . [ 13 ] and , because they work with a ﬁxed set of pure protein components , ambiguities related to cellular regulation of protein expression and other nontrivial side eﬀects of biology can be systematically excluded , allowing us to focus on the underlying physical mechanisms of control . Obtaining a metamaterial by modulating growth conditions requires external control , and the pri - mary experimentally accessible control variable in this system is the applied force as a function of time . Throughout , we consider a setting where the controller interacts with the material , allowing both measurement and feedback , which is a feature of the biological systems and could also be tractable ex - perimentally with appropriate microscopy . Directly tuning elastic coeﬃcients with a feedback protocol is not straightforward because this global property de - pends on the network structure in a complicated and nonlinear fashion . External growth forces do , how - ever , directly impact the local density at the growth front , which in turn is strongly connected to the re - sponse . Throughout , we study the emergent proper - ties of a ﬁxed , ﬁnal network at the end of its growth trajectory . III . MINIMAL MODEL OF ACTIN GROWTH UNDER EXTERNAL LOAD A Brownian ratchet has long been speculated as the mechanism through which external force impacts growth in actin networks [ 20 , 37 – 40 ] . The exper - iments of Li et al . [ 13 ] lend additional support to the Brownian ratchet model by imaging components of the assembly during growth . This set of experi - ments uses the cantilever arm of an atomic force mi - croscope to precisely apply force to the network in the direction of its growth . A similar experimen - tal setup was previously used to elucidate stress - stiﬀening and stress - softening in networks growing under large loads and stress - dependent growth dy - namics [ 10 , 11 , 30 ] . These experiments provide fun - damental insight into the nature of branched actin network assembly , and in particular , they highlight the delicate balance between polymerization , cap - ping and additional branching near nucleation pro - moting factors . Additionally , these reconstitution experiments highlight the strong dependence of ma - terial properties on growth conditions , even in the absence of biological stimuli . Because these experiments contain precisely con - trolled sets of ingredients , we sought to assess if the experimental ﬁndings were consistent with a min - 4 5 10 ( µ m ) Network height 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 ( µ m s ° 1 ) £ 10 ° 2 Growth velocity 10 1 10 2 10 3 ( µ m ° 2 ) Density Actin monomer Arp2 / 3 Capping protein 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 ( s ° 1 ) Reaction propensity Capping Branching 200 400 600 800 1000 10 20 Normalized load Time ( s ) a ) b ) c ) d ) FIG . 2 .

Under increasing loads ( bot - tom panel ) , a ) network height increases with b ) a re - duced growth velocity , c ) density of actin monomers , capping protein and Arp2 / 3 within 100 nm imalist model of polymerization against a ratchet - like load . The model we develop is partially in - spired by and shares many features with those in Refs . [ 41 – 43 ] . These two - dimensional models pro - vide useful qualitative insight into the dynamics of self - organization in branched actin networks in the lamellapodium . The network growth involves the interplay between ATP - dependent polymerization , Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching of the network , and quasi - irreversible capping of the growing barbed - ends of individual ﬁlaments . These reactions all have experimentally measured rates , and the physi - cal properties of individual actin ﬁlaments have been extensively characterized at the single molecule level ( see Table I ) . Remarkably , a Gillespie model that in - corporates only these experimentally known parame - ters predicts emergent , network - level properties that are consistent with experimental results . While the experimental analogue of the actin networks we con - sider are three - dimensional , we ﬁnd , as shown below , that a two - dimensional model is suﬃcient to explain the experimentally observed behavior . Our model geometry closely mimics the experi - mental setup described in Ref . [ 13 ] . As depicted in Fig . 1 , actin elongation occurs homogeneously throughout the network with a rate 𝑘 + actin . Bio - logically , actin growth is biased towards the plus end [ 3 ] , but the experimental setup that we com - pare most directly with includes only proﬁlin - bound actin which exclusively binds the plus end ; that is , no minus end growth occurs in our model . Polymer - ization is balanced by a reverse reaction in which actin spontaneously unbinds from existing ﬁlaments with a rate 𝑘 − actin . The imbalance in the forward and reverse growth rates leads to a steady - state positive growth velocity . For actin and all other components of the network , we ﬁx the chemical potential and assume there is suﬃcient excess of protein that de - pletion eﬀects can be neglected . Near the barrier , nucleation promoting factors en - courage branching of actin ﬁlaments via binding of the protein complex Arp2 / 3 [ 13 ] . We do not ex - plicitly represent nucleation promoting factors , but capture this proximity eﬀect by allowing Arp2 / 3 to bind to ﬁlaments within 10 ℓ actin of the barrier , where ℓ actin denotes the diameter of an actin monomer . In - teractions between the growing end of an actin ﬁla - ment and nucleation promoting factors can disrupt branching [ 13 ] , so we mollify the rate of branching based on the barbed end density near the growth front . Explicitly , the branching propensity is given by 𝑟 branching = 𝑘 + Arp2 / 3 𝑛 Arp2 / 3 binding sites × 𝑛 eﬀ Arp2 / 3 [ Arp2 / 3 Monomers ] , ( 4 ) where 𝑛 free is the number of free barbed ends , 𝑛 eﬀ Arp2 / 3 = max (cid:0) 0 , 𝑛 NPF − 𝑛 free (cid:1) , ( 5 ) and 𝑛 NPF is a ﬁxed constant . The elongation of an individual actin ﬁlament can be halted by the so - called capping protein , which binds free barbed ends with high aﬃnity . When a ﬁlament binds capping protein , an event that is con - sidered irreversible in our model , it no longer poly - merizes or depolymerizes . The only constraint on capping , which occurs homogeneously throughout the network , is steric hindrance with the barrier . Indeed , sterics dictate the overall growth trajec - tory of the network via the constraint imposed by 5 the rigid barrier depicted in Fig . 1 . The Brown - ian ratchet picture of actin growth under load as - serts that polymerization spontaneously occurs as the barrier ﬂuctuates away from the growth front . In our model , diﬀusion of the barrier under an applied load is reﬂected at the point of maximum height of the network . The transition probability density for such a reﬂected diﬀusion can be solved analyti - cally ( A3 ) , meaning that we can propagate the posi - tion of the barrier simply by sampling conditionally on time after a reaction occurs . Fig . 2 illustrates the model branched actin net - work growth under a step - wise increasing load force , which is in reliable qualitative agreement with exper - imental observations [ 13 ] . First , under an increasing load , the growth velocity of the actin network de - creases . This is primarily a consequence of the in - creased steric hindrance between the barrier ; under higher loads , ﬂuctuations in the barrier that enable polymerization are less likely . Second , the density of the materials near the growth front increases . To enable comparisons with experimental observables , we consider a region of interest within 100 nm of the growth - front , a region comparable to the imag - ing depth aﬀorded by Total Internal Fluorescent Mi - croscopy ( TIRF ) [ 44 ] . The reduction in growth ve - locity of the network under an increased load will re - sult in a larger number of uncapped ﬁlaments near the growth front of the network , inducing further capping and branching events , resulting in increased densities of actin monomers , capping proteins , and Arp2 / 3 complexes within this region . Third , we ob - serve that the reaction propensities for branching and capping are balanced across diﬀerent loads , with both propensities eventually decreasing under an in - creased load . In this setting , the increased number of free barbed ends interferes with branching events , while the increase in steric hindrance restricts cap - ping of ﬁlaments . IV . DIRECTING SELF - ASSEMBLY OF ACTIN STRUCTURES The load - induced stiﬀening by the external load force on a growing actin network suggests the possi - bility of engineering actin - based metamaterials . The spatial organization of the actin network depends strongly on the load history [ 11 ] , and furthermore , there is a strong coupling between the response of a network and its spatial organization . Previous work [ 35 ] has shown that reinforcement learning ( RL ) oﬀers a robust , yet straightforward framework for nonequilibrium control , when the tunable parame - ters are extrinsic , such as experimental control vari - ables .

Protocols and growth front density as a function of time for 200 networks grown to a target layered struc - ture with feedback protocols . The ensemble of state - dependent control protocols ( a ) enable realization of tar - get growth - front density ( b ) . we devise a multi - task RL strategy ( see Appendix E ) which allows us to spatially tune the network densi - ties and elicit material responses distinct from those available to homogeneous networks . The response of actin networks grown under a ﬁxed protocol exhibits high variance , limiting protocol - optimization strategies that directly seek to target a particular response . However , determining protocols that control the density of the network al - lows us to assemble actin networks in a targeted way because the response of a network is tightly cou - pled to density . In practice , we can only reason - ably control the growth front of the actin network as ﬁlaments that are not proximal to the barrier are quickly capped , and ﬁlament branching requires a nucleation promoting factor , which are implicitly present on the barrier . Therefore , we can only reg - ulate branching events on monomers proximal to the barrier . With this in mind , we use RL to de - sign external control protocols that produce speciﬁc growth front densities of a network . Here , we de - 6 ﬁne the growth - front density as the density of actin monomers within 10 ℓ actin of the barrier . We consider a discrete set of external loads ( see Table II ) to limit potential experimental challenges of applying load forces with arbitrary resolution . We then train external controllers that can , in a feed - back fashion , modulate the external load to achieve a desired density . In Figure 3 , we detail trajectories of protocols to grow layered networks with a low - density , soft , foundation and a high - density , stiﬀ , growth - front . The protocols to grow target layered structures are nondeterministic ; depending on the current state of the system , diﬀerent loads are re - quired to maintain a particular density and to transi - tion between diﬀerent densities . Importantly , we are able to target network densities with high ﬁdelity . Next , we consider the response properties of actin networks to time - periodic forces . We grow net - works targeted to diﬀerent densities , both uniform and layered ( Figure 4 ) . For uniform networks , we observe that the distribution of eigenvalues of the mass - normalized stiﬀness matrix ( see Appendix D ) is right - shifted under increasing density . Actin net - works grown to a higher density will have a larger number of smaller ﬁlaments , resulting in higher nat - ural frequencies of the network in comparison to networks with lower density . We further compute the corresponding response functions 𝑅 ( 𝜔 ) ( see Ap - pendix D ) , which we normalize by the number of nodes . Similarly , for uniform networks , we observe that the denser networks have a higher response as perturbations can more easily be distributed . Interestingly , we can engineer spatially tuned re - sponses by growing networks with heterogeneous density proﬁles . We target networks with a low - density foundation and a high - density growth - front ( 1 → 5 ) and a high - density foundation with a low - density growth - front ( 5 → 1 ) . We see that the over - all response of these layered networks exhibits an intermediate response in comparison to other uni - form networks . The response of each node depends strongly on its local environment and the nearby density ( see Figure 1 b ) . At frequency 𝜔 = 0 . 5 , the denser regions have higher responses , while sparser regions of the network have lower responses . That is , the emergent metamaterial modality of these net - works results directly from targeted control of the growth density . V .

Actin networks targeted to diﬀerent densities demonstrate diverse responses . 200 networks were grown to target growth - front monomeric densities ( 1 - 5 ) and lay - ered networks were grown with two layers of diﬀerent growth - front densities ( 1 → 5 and 5 → 1 ) . a ) The distri - bution of the eigenvalues for the mass - normalized stiﬀ - ness matrix ( C4 , D4 ) is right - shifted under increasing density , with layered densities displaying intermediate distributions . b ) The response function—normalized by the number of nodes— 𝑅 ( 𝜔 ) ( D8 ) is higher under increas - ing density with layered densities displaying intermediate responses . where modifying the energetic interactions among components is impossible . Here , we take inspiration from reconstitution experiments of dynamically as - sembling branched actin networks [ 13 ] and demon - strate that targeting distinct metamaterial proper - ties is possible without altering the underlying com - ponents , just by modulating an external control vari - able with a feedback protocol . We also show ( 1 ) that the entropy production rate—both in the envi - ronment and in an information reservoir—constrains the rate at which we can encode properties into a de - sired material . Such fundamental limits shed light on the necessary energetic costs of control , but fur - 7 0 5 10 15 − 0 . 10 − 0 . 05 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 1 → 5 v . 1 ( Sparse ) 5 → 1 v . 1 ( Sparse ) 1 → 5 v . 3 ( Moderate ) 5 → 1 v . 3 ( Moderate ) 1 → 5 v . 5 ( Dense ) 5 → 1 v . 5 ( Dense ) log 10 ( ω ) P − P r e f FIG . 5 . Diﬀerences in the density of states between in - homogeneous networks and homogeneous networks . The layered networks respond to perturbations with a proﬁle distinct from those of any homogeneous network . Com - pared to the ensemble of sparse networks , the layered networks have a suppressed response at low frequencies and an enhanced response at higher frequencies . Com - pared to the ensemble of dense networks , the layered networks have an enhanced response at low frequencies , and a suppressed response at higher frequencies . These plots indicate the layer networks mix , albeit in a com - plicated way , the properties of the low density and high density actin networks . ther investigation of these bounds is required to ex - tract practical design principles for controlling ﬂuc - tuating materials . The control framework we introduce here can readily be extended to an experimental setting , even one without mechanisms for feedback . Empirical distributions of control protocols for a speciﬁc target can be used as a proxy for a more precise feedback protocols . The system we investigate here limits a quantitative investigation into the entropic costs re - quired to encode particular responses because the reference steady state is dissipative . However , the computational and theoretical framework motivate a more systematic study into tradeoﬀs between infor - mation acquisition , dissipated heat and the control of a system towards a target state divergent from a nonequilibrium steady state . Additionally , this tradeoﬀ can be incorporated into a protocol opti - mization scheme to design protocols that can encode desired responses with a minimal dissipative cost .

The MIT Press , Cambridge , Massachusetts , second edition edition , 2018 . 10 Appendix A : Minimal model of actin network growth We simulate stochastic trajectories of actin network growth under a load using the Gillespie algorithm ( Algorithm 1 ) . Under this scheme , we sample reactions according to their relative reaction propensity and sample a reaction time that is inversely proportional to the overall reaction propensity of the system . Finally , after carrying out a reaction , we evolve the position of the barrier . We deﬁne the reaction propensity to be the product of the rate and the number of each of the reactants . For a bimolecular reaction 𝐴 + 𝐵 → 𝐶 , the forward reaction propensity , given a rate 𝑘 , can be written as 𝑟 = 𝑘𝑛 𝐴 𝑛 𝐵 , ( A1 ) where 𝑟 has units of inverse time . Given 𝑛 possible reactions in the system , we select a reaction 𝑗 to occur based on its relative reaction propensity 𝑟 𝑗 (cid:205) 𝑛𝑖 𝑟 𝑖 . We deﬁne the time of the reaction to be 𝜏 = 1 (cid:205) 𝑛𝑖 𝑟 𝑖 log (cid:0) 1 𝑢 (cid:1) , where 𝑢 is a randomly sampled from a uniform distribution deﬁned on [ 0 , 1 ] . Finally , consistent with a Brownian ratchet mechanism , we evolve the position of the barrier according to a Langevin equation , (cid:164) ℎ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐹 / 𝛾 + √ 2 𝐷 𝜂 ( 𝑡 ) , ( A2 ) where 𝜂 ( 𝑡 ) is a Gaussian random variable with (cid:104) 𝜂 ( 𝑡 ) (cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104) 𝜂 ( 𝑡 ) 𝜂 ( 𝑡 (cid:48) ) (cid:105) = 𝛿 ( 𝑡 − 𝑡 (cid:48) ) .

We can analytically solve the Fokker - Planck equation corresponding to ( A2 ) with reﬂective boundary conditions [ 49 , 50 ] . For a constant force 𝐹 and 𝜏 , the duration of the reaction , the height of the distribution of the barrier height at the end of the reaction can be described according to 𝑃 ( ℎ 𝑡 + 𝜏 ; ℎ 𝑡 , 𝜏 ) = 𝑃 1 ( ℎ 𝑡 + 𝜏 ; ℎ 𝑡 , 𝜏 ) + 𝑃 2 ( ℎ 𝑡 + 𝜏 ; ℎ 𝑡 , 𝜏 ) + 𝑃 3 ( ℎ 𝑡 + 𝜏 ; ℎ 𝑡 , 𝜏 ) .

Note that 𝑃 1 corresponds to the solution of the Fokker - Planck equation with no reﬂective boundary , while 𝑃 2 and 𝑃 3 correspond to transition probabilities that account for a reﬂective boundary . We can sample a new position for the barrier by numerically solving the equation ∫ ℎ 𝑡 + 𝜏 0 𝑑ℎ (cid:48) 𝑃 2 ( ℎ (cid:48) ; ℎ 𝑡 , 𝜏 ) + 𝑃 3 ( ℎ (cid:48) ; ℎ 𝑡 , 𝜏 ) = 1 2erfc [ (cid:0) ℎ 𝑡 + 𝐹 𝛾 𝜏 (cid:1) / √ 4 𝐷𝜏 ] − 1 2 exp (cid:18) 𝐹ℎ 𝛾𝐷 (cid:19) erfc [ (cid:0) ℎ 𝑡 + 𝜏 + ℎ 𝑡 + 𝐹 𝛾 𝜏 ) / √ 4 𝐷𝜏 ] = 𝑟 ( A5 ) for ℎ 𝑡 + 𝜏 , where 𝑟 is a uniform random number chosen from the interval [ 0 , 𝑟 max ] , where 𝑟 max = ∫ ∞ 0 𝑑ℎ (cid:48) 𝑃 2 ( ℎ (cid:48) ; ℎ 𝑡 , 𝜏 ) + 𝑃 3 ( ℎ (cid:48) ; ℎ 𝑡 , 𝜏 ) = 1 2erfc [ ( ℎ 𝑡 + 𝐹 𝛾 𝜏 ) / √ 4 𝐷𝜏 ] . ( A6 ) See Ref . [ 50 ] for a detailed discussion and the derivation of the expressions above . We consider actin network growth on a two - dimensional surface , where only barbed - end growth is allowed . This latter constraint is consistent with the experimental setup in [ 13 ] and is enforced by using proﬁlin - bound actin monomers . Additionally , we ﬁx the chemical potential ( i . e . the concentration ) for all the constituent proteins , allowing us to neglect potential depletion eﬀects . We deﬁne four possible reactions : actin ﬁlament polymerization , actin ﬁlament depolymerization , actin ﬁlament branching and barbed - end capping , which are detailed below . 1 . Actin ﬁlament polymerization 𝑟 on = 𝑘 + actin 𝑛 polymerizable ﬁlaments [ Actin Monomers ] ( A7 ) This reaction results in the addition of an actin monomer to the barbed - end of a single actin ﬁlament . Here , 𝑛 polymerizable ﬁlaments is the number of actin ﬁlaments that can be polymerized . Filaments that can be polymerized are those that do not have a capping protein bound and those whose distance between the barbed - end and the barrier is greater than the diameter of an actin monomer ( ℓ actin ) . 2 . Actin ﬁlament depolymerization 𝑟 oﬀ = 𝑘 − actin 𝑛 depolymerizable ﬁlaments ( A8 ) This reaction results in the removal of an actin monomer from the barbed - end of a single actin ﬁlament . Here , 𝑛 depolymerizable ﬁlaments is the number of actin ﬁlaments that can be depolymerized . Filaments that can be depolymerized are those that do not have a capping protein or an Arp2 / 3 protein bound to the the leading monomer at the barbed - end of the ﬁlament . 3 . Actin ﬁlament branching ( via Arp2 / 3 ) 𝑟 branching = 𝑘 + Arp2 / 3 𝑛 Arp2 / 3 binding sites 𝑛 eﬀ Arp2 / 3 [ Arp2 / 3 Monomers ] ( A9 ) 12 This reaction results in the irreversible binding of the Arp2 / 3 protein complex to a “mother” ﬁlament enabling a branched “daughter” ﬁlament to grow . Biologically , Arp2 / 3 binding to a mother ﬁlament is contingent on a nucleation promotion factor ( NPFs ) . Furthermore , NPFs can be subject to“barbed - end interference” [ 13 ] , which occurs when uncapped barbed - ends of actin ﬁlaments engage with NPFs , restricting Arp2 / 3 binding . For simplicity , we do not explicitly account for NPFs in our model ; instead , we implicitly incorporate the eﬀect of NPFs through a scaling factor 𝑛 eﬀ arp2 / 3 = max (cid:0) 0 , 𝑛 NPF − 𝑛 free (cid:1) . ( A10 ) Here , 𝑛 free is the number of free barbed ends within 10 ℓ actin of the barrier and 𝑛 NPF represents the number of NPFs , and in practice , is a free parameter that we can tune . Finally , 𝑛 Arp2 / 3 binding sites is the number of potential monomer binding sites for an Arp2 / 3 protein to bind . These sites include all monomers within 10 ℓ actin of the barrier that do not already have an Arp2 / 3 protein bound . Lastly , we note that 𝑘 Arp2 / 3 on is deﬁned as the rate of binding per mother ﬁlament , whereas the reaction propensity we compute considers it as the rate of binding per monomer on the mother ﬁlament . We absorb this diﬀerence into the free parameter 𝑛 NPF . 4 . Barbed - end capping 𝑟 capping = 𝑘 + capping 𝑛 cappable ﬁlaments [ Capping Protein Monomers ] ( A11 ) This reaction results in the irreversible binding of a capping protein to the barbed - end of a ﬁlament , preventing further actin polymerization and depolymerization . Here , 𝑛 cappable ﬁlaments corresponds to the number of ﬁlaments that can bind a capping protein . Filaments that can be capped are those that do not already have a capping protein bound and those whose distance between the barbed - end and the barrier is greater than the diameter of a capping protein ( ℓ cp ) .

S1 . Average growth velocity and barbed end density for diﬀerent growth loads ( normalized by 𝑓 0 ) over 500 networks . Under an increased load , actin networks have more free barbed ends and a lower growth velocity . Barbed end density is computed over the region 100 nm from the barrier . To investigate the validity of our model , we grew an ensemble of networks under a step - wise increasing load ( see Figure 2 and Figure S1 ) similar to the experimental investigation carried out in [ 13 ] . In these experiments , we initially subject the network to a growth load of 𝑓 0 ( see Table I ) and increase the growth load by 𝑓 0 every 50 seconds . 13 First , we observe that under an increased load , the growth velocity of the network decreases ( Figure 2 a , b ) . Under an increased load , ﬁlament elongation near the barrier is restricted due to steric hindrance , limiting the growth of the network . Second , we observe that under increased load , the density of the actin monomer , capping protein and Arp2 / 3 within a 100 nm region from the barrier increases ( Figure 2 c ) . We consider this restricted region—as opposed to the entire network—to be consistent with experimental measurements obtained via TIRF . Third , we observe that the propensities for branching and capping are balanced ( Figure 2 d ) across diﬀerent loads . Importantly , the propensity for branching decreases with increasing load as a result of barbed - end interference , while the propensity for capping decreases with increasing load as a result of steric hindrance with the barrier . This balance in propensities between capping and branching ensures steady - state network growth . Finally , we observe an inverse relationship between the growth velocity and the free barbed - end density ( Figure S1 ) . Increases in the barbed - end density interfere with branching , which in turn inhibits network growth and causes a reduction in the growth velocity . Furthermore , we capture the phenomenon that subsequent increases in the barbed end density decreases with increasing load , leading to a decreasing slope in the curve . Together , these results demonstrate that our model captures most of the key observations from experi - ments , making it a suitable environment for investigating control of actin network growth .

S2 . Schematic of actin ﬁlament deformations . Axial strains deform ﬁlament along principal axis , bending strain deforms ﬁlament away from the principal axis , and shear strain deforms ﬁlament’s cross section . We investigate the response of actin networks to external compressive forces in order to gain insight into the elastic properties of networks grown under diﬀerent load forces . During the growth process , outside of daughter ﬁlaments that branch from a mother ﬁlament , ﬁlaments within the network are not interconnected . To investigate network - level mechanical responses to compressive forces , we consider intersecting ﬁlaments to be crosslinked—this can be enforced in an experiment setting via a crosslinking protein such as ﬁlamin [ 10 ] . Ultimately , this framework allows us to consider the actin network as a collection of nodes and edges , where nodes correspond to either a branching point , a crosslinking point or the end of a network . We consider ﬁlament ( i . e . edge ) deformations that include an axial strain , a bending strain and a shear strain ( Figure S2 ) . The axial strain corresponds to compressions or elongations of the ﬁlament along the principal axis of the edge , the bending strain corresponds to curvatures along the ﬁlament away from the principal axis , and the shear strain corresponds to distortion of the ﬁlament’s cross - section . A ﬁlament experiences a combination of these deformations simultaneously under a compressive load , and we can compute this overall deformation by deﬁning a stiﬀness matrix that we use in conjunction with Hooke’s law to determine equilibrium network responses to compressive forces . More precisely , given a compressive force 𝑭 and a stiﬀness matrix 𝐾 , we can compute the deformations of each edge 𝒖 = 𝐾 − 1 𝑭 , ( C1 ) 14 where 𝒖 = [ 𝑢 𝑥 1 , 𝑢 𝑦 1 , 𝑢 𝜃 1 , 𝑢 𝑥 2 , 𝑢 𝑥 2 , 𝑢 𝜃 2 ] 𝑇 . Here , 𝑢 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝑢 𝑦 𝑖 represents the change in the 𝑥 and 𝑦 coordinates of the 𝑖 th node and 𝑢 𝜃 𝑖 corresponds to the deviation of the 𝑖 th node from the principal axis ( see Figure S2 ) . We deﬁne the compressive force 𝑭 = [ 𝐹 𝑥 1 , 𝐹 𝑦 1 , 𝐹 𝑀 1 , 𝐹 𝑥 2 , 𝐹 𝑦 2 , 𝐹 𝑀 2 ] , where 𝐹 𝑥 𝑖 and 𝐹 𝑦 𝑖 are the forces on the 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions of the 𝑖 th node and 𝐹 𝑀 𝑖 is the torque acting on the 𝑖 th node . For an actin ﬁlament with cross - sectional area 𝐴 , length 𝐿 , modulus elasticity 𝐸 , moment of inertia 𝐼 , and unit vector 𝒆 , the stiﬀness matrix [ 51 , 52 ] , is given by 𝐾 = 𝐸 𝐿  𝐴𝑒 2 𝑥 + 12 𝐼𝑒 2 𝑦 𝐿 2 (cid:0) 𝐴 − 12 𝐼 𝐿 2 (cid:1) 𝑒 𝑥 𝑒 𝑦 − 6 𝐼𝐿 𝑒 𝑦 − (cid:16) 𝐴𝑒 2 𝑥 + 12 𝐼 𝐿 2 𝑒 2 𝑦 (cid:17) − (cid:0) 𝐴 − 12 𝐼 𝐿 2 (cid:1) 𝑒 𝑥 𝑒 𝑦 − 6 𝐼𝐿 𝑒 𝑦 𝐴𝑒 2 𝑦 + 12 𝐼 𝐿 2 𝑒 2 𝑥 6 𝐼𝐿 𝑒 𝑥 − (cid:0) 𝐴 − 12 𝐼 𝐿 2 (cid:1) 𝑒 𝑥 𝑒 𝑦 − (cid:16) 𝐴𝑒 2 𝑦 + 12 𝐼𝑒 2 𝑥 𝐿 2 (cid:17) 6 𝐼𝐿 𝑒 𝑥 4 𝐼 6 𝐼𝐿 𝑒 𝑦 − 6 𝐼𝐿 𝑒 𝑥 2 𝐼 𝐴𝑒 2 𝑥 + 12 𝐼𝑒 2 𝑦 𝐿 2 (cid:0) 𝐴 − 12 𝐼 𝐿 2 (cid:1) 𝑒 𝑥 𝑒 𝑦 6 𝐼𝐿 𝑒 𝑦 sym 𝐴𝑒 2 𝑦 + 12 𝐼 𝐿 2 𝑒 2 𝑥 − 6 𝐼𝐿 𝑒 𝑥 4 𝐼  . ( C2 ) We can compute network - level responses to a compressive force by deﬁning a stiﬀness matrix for a network of 𝑁 nodes and 𝑀 edges . First , we lift the edge - level stiﬀness matrix 𝐾 ∈ R 6 × 6 to the stiﬀness matrix K ∈ R 3 𝑁 × 3 𝑁 . Given an edge 𝑖 that connects nodes 𝑎 and 𝑏 , and 𝑟 , 𝑠 ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 } , we deﬁne K 𝑖𝛼 , 𝛽 =   𝐾 𝑖𝑟 , 𝑠 , if ( 𝛼 , 𝛽 ) = ( 3 𝑎 + 𝑟 , 3 𝑎 + 𝑠 ) 𝐾 𝑖𝑟 , 3 + 𝑠 , if ( 𝛼 , 𝛽 ) = ( 3 𝑎 + 𝑟 , 3 𝑏 + 𝑠 ) 𝐾 𝑖 3 + 𝑟 , 𝑠 , if ( 𝛼 , 𝛽 ) = ( 3 𝑏 + 𝑟 , 3 𝑎 + 𝑠 ) 𝐾 𝑖 3 + 𝑟 , 3 + 𝑠 , if ( 𝛼 , 𝛽 ) = ( 3 𝑏 + 𝑟 , 3 𝑏 + 𝑠 ) 0 , otherwise . ( C3 ) Conceptually , in ( C3 ) , we take each quadrant of 𝐾 𝑖 and ﬁll in the appropriate region of K 𝑖 corresponding to node 𝑎 and 𝑏 . We can then compute the global stiﬀness matrix of the network K global = 𝑀 ∑︁ 𝑖 = 1 K 𝑖 . ( C4 ) Finally , to realize a physically meaningful compression , we enforce a rigid base of the network by ﬁxing all nodes within a cutoﬀ of 0 . 5 𝜇 m from 𝑦 = 0 . We remove the rows and columns of the stiﬀness matrix K that corresponds to these ﬁxed nodes and can use ( C1 ) to compute the deformation of every ﬁlament in the network .

For simplicity , we work with units where the axial rigidity 𝐴𝐸 = 1 and the ratio 𝐸𝐼 / 𝐴𝐸 = 0 . 01 . 15 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 Strain 0 2 4 6 8 10 S tr e ss Layered ( 1 → 5 ) Layered ( 5 → 1 ) 1 ( Sparse ) 2 3 4 5 ( Dense ) FIG . S3 . Plot of Stress ( Σ ) vs . Strain ( Δ ) for 200 networks of diﬀerent composition . See Figure 4 caption for description of legends . The strain represents the fraction of compression of the network and stress represents the applied force required to achieve the strain To obtain the stress - strain proﬁle , we apply a series of linearly increasing compressive forces on the network and compute the strain at step 𝑖 as Δ 𝑖 = ℎ 0 − ℎ 𝑖 ℎ 0 ( C5 ) and the stress at step 𝑖 as Σ 𝑖 = ∑︁ 𝑖 𝜎 𝑖 , ( C6 ) where 𝜎 𝑖 = 𝐹 stress 𝑖 ˜ 𝑁 𝑖 , 𝐹 stress 𝑖 = 𝑖𝐹 stress0 and ˜ 𝑁 𝑖 is the number of nodes within 0 . 2 𝜇 m of the growth - front of the network . We work with small compressions and deﬁne 𝐹 stress0 = 0 . 001 . Here , the stress is measured in units of 𝐴𝐸 . In the curves shown in Figure S3 , we set Δ thresh = 0 . 3 resulting in compression of the network to 70 % of its initial height . We see that uniform networks with higher density have increasingly stiﬀer responses , while layered networks have intermediate responses . Because we’re only applying a stress on the top region of the network , the layered network with a denser growth front ( 1 → 5 ) has a stiﬀer response in comparison to the layered network with a sparser growth front ( 5 → 1 ) . Appendix D : Response of actin networks under time periodic forces We apply a time - periodic force to actin networks to study the frequency response of networks grown under diﬀerent load conditions . For a time - periodic force 𝑭 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑭 0 exp ( 𝑖𝜔𝑡 ) applied to a network , the motion of the nodes in a single edge evolve according to 𝑀 (cid:165) 𝒖 = 𝐾 𝒖 + 𝑭 ( 𝑡 ) , ( D1 ) where 𝑀 is the mass matrix that accounts for the nonzero mass of an edge . For a ﬁlament ( i . e . edge ) with mass density 𝜌 , length 𝐿 and unit vector 𝒆 , the mass matrix [ 51 , 53 ] is given by 𝑀 = 𝜌𝐿 420  4 (cid:16) 35 𝑒 2 𝑥 + 39 𝑒 2 𝑦 (cid:17) − 16 𝑒 𝑥 𝑒 𝑦 − 22 𝐿𝑒 𝑦 70 𝑒 2 𝑥 + 54 𝑒 2 𝑦 16 𝑒 𝑥 𝑒 𝑦 13 𝐿𝑒 𝑦 4 (cid:16) 39 𝑒 2 𝑥 + 35 𝑒 2 𝑦 (cid:17) 22 𝑒 𝑥 𝐿 16 𝑒 𝑥 𝑒 𝑦 54 𝑒 2 𝑥 + 70 𝑒 2 𝑦 − 13 𝑒 𝑥 𝐿 4 𝐿 2 − 13 𝐿𝑒 𝑦 13 𝑒 𝑥 𝐿 − 3 𝐿 2 4 (cid:16) 35 𝑒 2 𝑥 + 39 𝑒 2 𝑦 (cid:17) − 16 𝑒 𝑥 𝑒 𝑦 22 𝐿𝑒 𝑦 sym 4 (cid:16) 39 𝑒 2 𝑥 + 35 𝑒 2 𝑦 (cid:17) − 22 𝑒 𝑥 𝐿 4 𝐿 2    ( D2 ) 16 As with the stiﬀness matrix in Section C , we can compute a mass matrix for the entire network .

( D3 ) We can then compute the global mass matrix of the network M global = 𝑀 ∑︁ 𝑖 = 1 M 𝑖 . ( D4 ) In Figure 4 b ) , we compute the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix D global = M − 1global K global . Using M global and the global stiﬀness matrix K global , we can use ( D1 ) to solve for the response of the entire network . The solution can be written down as 𝒖 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝒖 0 exp ( 𝑖𝜔𝑡 ) , ( D5 ) where 𝒖 0 = G ( 𝜔 ) 𝑭 0 and G ( 𝜔 ) = ( − 𝜔 2 M global + K global ) − 1 . For a periodic force with frequency 𝜔 , we can compute the time - averaged covariance matrix of node responses 𝐶 ( 𝑭 0 , 𝜔 ) = 1 2 𝜋𝜔 ∫ 2 𝜋𝜔 0 Re ( 𝒖 ) Re ( 𝒖 ) 𝑇 𝑑𝑡 = G ( 𝜔 ) 𝑭 0 𝑭 † 0 G † ( 𝜔 ) , ( D6 ) where ( · ) † denotes a conjugate transpose . Given 𝑭 0 , we can compute the response of the network as 𝑅 𝑭 0 ( 𝜔 ) = Tr (cid:0) 𝐶 ( 𝑭 0 , 𝜔 ) (cid:1) , ( D7 ) where Tr ( ( · ) ) denotes the trace . Finally , for an ensemble of forces that satisfy (cid:104) 𝑭 0 𝑭 † 0 (cid:105) = I , we can compute an average response 𝑅 ( 𝜔 ) = (cid:104) 𝑅 𝑭 0 ( 𝜔 ) (cid:105) 𝑭 0 = Tr (cid:16) G ( 𝜔 ) (cid:104) 𝑭 0 𝑭 † 0 (cid:105)G † ( 𝜔 ) (cid:17) = Tr (cid:16) G ( 𝜔 ) G † ( 𝜔 ) (cid:17) . ( D8 ) The response will be maximum at frequencies where 𝜔 2 is an eigenvalue of the stiﬀness matrix as G − 1 ( 𝜔 ) yields a null matrix at those frequencies . 17 Hyperparameters Name Value 𝑄 learning rate 3 × 10 − 4 Optimizer Adam Target Update Rate ( 𝜏 ) 5 × 10 − 3 Batch Size 32 Discount Factor ( 𝛾 ) 0 . 9 Number of Hidden Layers 2 Network Width 64 𝑇 50 A ( Normalized by 𝑓 0 ) [ 1 . 0 , 2 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 6 . 0 , 8 . 0 , 10 . 0 , 12 . 0 , 14 . 0 , 16 . 0 , 18 . 0 ] TABLE II .

We use a variant of Q - Learning , known as clipped double Q - learning [ 35 , 54 , 55 ] , that incorporates two Q networks to avoid an underestimation bias and uses a soft policy update [ 56 ] to ensure a more stable training process . Generally , with reinforcement learning , we are interested in training an agent to optimize interactions ( i . e . actions ) with an uncertain environment in order to optimize some reward [ 57 ] . Here , our environment consists of an actin network growing against a load and the agent is an external controller that can take action on the environment by modulating the strength of the load force . Because the capping protein arrests ﬁlament elongation and shrinkage and because ﬁlaments that are not proximal to the barrier are quickly capped , in practice , we can only reasonably control the growth - front of the actin network . We deﬁne the growth - front of the network to be the region within 10 ℓ actin from the barrier 18 where Arp2 / 3 binding—and as a result branching—can take place . Given a task of targeting a growth - front density of 𝑓 𝑖 ∗ , we deﬁne the task - speciﬁc reward function 𝑅 𝑖 ( 𝒙 ) = (cid:12)(cid:12) 𝑓 gf ( 𝒙 ) − 𝑓 𝑖 ∗ (cid:12)(cid:12) . ( E1 ) We note that in this setting , we aim to minimize the reward in order to reliably target speciﬁc densities . With Q - learning , we learn a state - action value function 𝑄 ( 𝒙 , 𝒂 ) = E 𝑢 (cid:34) ∞ ∑︁ 𝑘 = 0 𝛾 𝑘 𝑅 ( 𝒙 𝑡 + 1 ) (cid:35) , ( E2 ) where 𝑄 ( 𝒙 , 𝑎 ) represents the expected value of a discounted cumulative reward upon taking a particular action 𝑎 given a current state 𝒙 with subsequent actions according to a protoocl 𝑢 . We consider a discrete action space A ( see Table II ) to limit potential experimental challenges of applying load forces with arbitrary resolution . In practice , we will not have access to the full state of the system 𝒙 ; to account for the limited resolution we can access experimentally , we deﬁne the state of the system 𝒔 ∈ R 3 , to be the actin monomer density , ARP2 / 3 density and the capping protein density within 100 nm of the barrier . These densities are directly comparable to the experimental ﬂuorescent measurements of actin monomer , capping protein and Arp2 / 3 obtained via TIRF . We are interested in targeting a set of growth - front densities { 𝑓 ∗ 𝑖 } 𝑛𝑖 = 1 , to both grow networks with various densities and to create layered networks . We approach this with a multi - task RL framework , where given a target growth - front density of 𝑓 𝑖 ∗ and the corresponding reward function 𝑅 𝑖 , we train a state - action value function 𝑄 𝑖 ( 𝒔 , 𝑎 ) ( see Algorithm 3 ) . For each task 𝑖 , we use the trained 𝑄 1 as our 𝑄 𝑖 . In our framework , each 𝑄 𝑖 is an individual neural network , but , in practice , could also be a single neural network 𝑄 ( · , 𝑖 ) , with a task label . Given a set of trained value functions , { 𝑄 𝑖 } 𝑛𝑖 = 1 , our control protocol is 𝑢 ( 𝒔 𝑡 , 𝑡 ) = argmin 𝑎 ∈A 𝑄 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) ( 𝒔 𝑡 , 𝑎 ) , ( E3 ) where 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) , represents the index of the desired growth - front density at some time 𝑡 . We manually deﬁne 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) to grow layered networks or homogeneous networks of diﬀerent densities ( see Algorithm 4 ) . 19 0 5 10 15 20 0 2 4 6 8 10 Target Ensemble 0 5 10 15 20 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 5 10 15 20 0 2 4 6 8 10 1 2 3 4 0 5 10 15 20 1 2 3 4 0 2 4 6 8 10 Network height ( µ m ) N o r m a li ze d l oa d G r o w t h f r o n t d e n s i t y ( µ m − 2 ) FIG .
