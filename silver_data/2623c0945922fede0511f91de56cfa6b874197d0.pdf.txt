However , the construction of highly accurate , low resolution CG models of biomolecules remains challenging . We demonstrate in this work how virtual particles , CG sites with no atomistic correspondence , can be incorporated into CG models within the context of relative entropy minimization ( REM ) as latent variables . The methodology presented , variational derivative relative entropy minimization ( VD - REM ) , enables optimization of virtual particle interactions through a gradient descent algorithm aided by machine learning . We apply this methodology to the challenging case of a solvent - free CG model of a 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) lipid bilayer and demonstrate that introduction of virtual particles captures solvent - mediated behavior and higher - order correlations which REM alone cannot 2 capture in a more standard CG model based only on the mapping of collections of atoms to the CG sites . I . Introduction Atomistic molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations have enabled key insights into biological and material processes . 1 - 3 but modern hardware limits the practicality of MD to the study of millions of atoms on the multi - microsecond scale . This precludes sampling of many biologically relevant phenomena , such as macromolecular assembly . 4 Coarse - grained ( CG ) models aim to extend the spatiotemporal scales of MD by simulating a lower - resolution representation of a system , increasing the efficiency of the simulation . 5 - 8 CG model construction and parameterization often follow either a top - down or bottom - up approach . 7 , 8 In the top - down approach , a CG model is parameterized to directly reproduce macroscopic properties such as thermodynamic data . Popular top - down approaches such as MARTINI have been used to simulate biomolecular structures such as proteins and multicomponent lipid bilayers . 9 - 11 However , these models are not parameterized to reproduce the microscopic correlations and enthalpy - entropy decompositions underpinning these properties . 12 Bottom - up models instead aim to reproduce the microscopic behavior of a reference atomistic model , with the intent of indirectly capturing emergent behavior . 8 , 13 - 18 While bottom - up CG models have an explicit correspondence to the atomistic representation and in principle have a greater potential in accurately describing the underlying physics , their application is limited due to the necessity of imperfect basis sets ( force field expressions ) to represent the CG interactions , as well as issues of representability and transferability . 19 - 21 Ideally , equilibrium simulations of bottom - up CG models will reproduce the configurational distribution of the CG variables implied by the atomistic reference simulation . The exact CG model Hamiltonian whose Boltzmann statistics reproduce the reference distribution is referred to as the CG variable potential of mean force ( mbPMF ) , 14 , 15 and is often 3 many - body in nature . 22 , 23 In the limit of infinite sampling and a perfect basis set to represent the CG interactions , bottom - up CG methods such as Multiscale Coarse - graining 13 , 15 , 16 ( MS - CG ) and Relative Entropy Minimization 17 , 18 , 24 ( REM ) are guaranteed to reproduce the mbPMF . However , practical considerations often relegate the CG force - field ( basis set ) to pairwise non - bonded interactions . Enhancing the expressivity of CG force fields beyond a pairwise basis set through explicit higher - order terms 25 and order parameter ( e . g . , local density ) based interactions 26 - 30 enables the capture of certain many - body statistics . However , for biological systems , it is generally not clear which higher - order terms should be included . Machine - learned CG force - fields can be utilized to construct general approximations to many - body statistics , 31 - 35 albeit at increased computational cost . Practical implementations of bottom - up CG methods possess characteristic approximations often affiliated with matching lower - order correlations . Certain methods such as REM , 24 inverse Monte Carlo 36 ( IMC ) , and iterative Boltzmann inversion 37 ( IBI ) guarantee fidelity of correlations which correspond to a particular interaction in the CG force field ( e . g . , optimization of a pair interaction reproduces the corresponding pair correlation ) . This matching of lower - order correlations often comes at the expense of accurately describing the higher - order correlations . The MS - CG method instead attempts a complete fit to the mbPMF through approximation of the mean forces on CG sites via an integral equation connection of the two - and three - body correlations , 14 but it is not guaranteed to completely reproduce any structural correlations when an incomplete basis set is used to represent the interactions at the CG level . 38 For any CG method , improvement of the CG models must proceed through either an increase in the complexity of the CG force field or a change in the considered CG resolution . Recent advances have , however , focused on augmenting the CG force field while maintaining a pairwise basis set . For example , the pairwise interactions in CG models can be altered to explicitly include higher - order correlations by projecting many - body interactions 4 onto the pairwise basis set . 39 Alternatively , various kinds of ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù sites have been introduced in bottom - up CG models , which can reintroduce orientational information in isotropic CG models and / or capture solvent - mediated interactions . 40 - 42 One can define virtual sites generally as sites with more complex relationships to the CG ( or AA ) model than other sites within the model . Such virtual sites may be related to the atomistic system through a non - linear mapping , or they may be defined in relation to other variables present in the model system . Ideally , the optimization of virtual site interactions in a CG model results in direct improvement of the behavior of the non - virtual or ‚Äúreal‚Äù CG particles . Consequently , the inclusion of virtual particles into a CG model may be most fruitful for very low - resolution CG models , as shown in Figure 1 . Virtual sites have similarly been introduced in both all - atom ( AA ) and top - down CG models to suit a variety of model - specific needs . These include imparting anisotropic projections , such as in the TIP4P water model , improving stability of cholesterol in top - down CG models , and aiding in mixed resolution AA / CG simulations . 43 - 45 In the context of bottom - up CG models , development of virtual particles has generally been impeded by their complex relationship to the associated CG model . Methods centered around distribution matching , e . g . , REM , can be directly incorporated so long as virtual sites are observed in the reference simulation , and can furthermore indirectly enable force - based parameterization . 42 However , parameterization of virtual sites directly through force - based methods , although possible for particularly defined virtual sites , 41 is limited . In either case , these limitations are a consequence of missing information regarding virtual site behavior within the reference ( usually all - atom ) simulation . Such missing information may include forces for virtual sites whose non - linear mapping precludes their direct computation or , for latent virtual sites , a reference distribution altogether . We consider virtual sites of the latter form in this manuscript . 5 Although limited , certain methods do exist which are capable of optimizing CG models for which a reference virtual site distribution is not directly available . Such methods include Inverse Monte Carlo ( IMC ) and Adversarial - Residual - Coarse - Graining ( ARCG ) . 46 In IMC , the expectation of a vector - valued observable , necessarily a function of exclusively real particles , is considered for optimization . 36 ARCG by contrast minimizes a selected f - divergence between reference and model distributions at the CG resolution , which subsequently results in the optimization of a scalar - value observable whose form must be obtained variationally . 46 Figure 1 . Example of CG mapping and VCG mapping for a lipid bilayer . The mapping operator ‚Ñ≥ relates the solvated AA bilayer ( left ) to the implicit solvent CG resolution ( middle ) , while the mapping operator ùí¢ relates the VCG resolution ( right ) which contains virtual particles ( purple ) to the CG resolution . Although the two methods are conceptually different , their approach to virtual particle optimization is similar in that the observable expectations considered must be calculable either directly ( IMC ) or indirectly through variational search ( ARCG ) at the CG resolution . We present here a REM - based methodology for virtual particle optimization , variational derivative relative entropy minimization ( VD - REM ) , which utilizes a distinct variational statement to approximate the derivative of the relative entropy . Similar to both IMC and ARCG , this enables a gradient descent algorithm for which all calculations are performed at the CG resolution . We find that machine - learned models can be useful in VD - REM in approximating target functions necessary for optimization . We apply VD - REM to construct a VCG model of a 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) lipid bilayer without solvent ( i . e . , ‚Äúsolvent free‚Äù or sometimes called ‚Äúimplicit‚Äù solvent ) . Inclusion of virtual particles optimized by VD - REM demonstrates improved model behavior at the CG resolution , including recapture of self - assembly and bilayer flexibility . Lastly , we note that the presented 6 methodology bears conceptual similarities with Predictive Coarse - Graining , 47 which further suggests an alternative approach to virtual particle optimization , as detailed in the Discussion . II . Theory A . Model Definitions Before introducing virtual CG particles , we first explicitly define the AA and CG models . The fine - grained ( FG ) model is described by a collection of masses , ùê¶ , and configurational and momentum degrees of freedom ùê´ ùëõ and ùê© ùëõ , respectively . Reference simulations of the FG model are generated using the dynamics of the FG Hamiltonian ‚Ñé ( ùê´ ùëõ , ùê© ùëõ ) = ùë¢ ( ùê´ ùëõ ) + ‚àë ùê© ùëñ 2 2ùëö ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ = 1 ( 1 ) In the canonical ensemble , molecular dynamics simulations sample from the Boltzmann distribution generated by the FG Hamiltonian ùëù FG ( ùê´ ùëõ , ùê© ùëõ ) = 1 ùëß exp ( ‚àíùõΩ‚Ñé ( ùê´ ùëõ , ùê© ùëõ ) ) ( 2 ) where ùõΩ = 1 k B ùëá . The normalization factor ( ignoring constants due to indistinguishability and unit normalization ) is the classical partition function , and can be written as ùëß = ‚à¨ e ‚àíùõΩ‚Ñé ( ùê´ ùëõ , ùê© ùëõ ) dùê´ ùëõ dùê© ùëõ = ùëß ùê´ ùëß ùê© ( 3 ) The separability of position and momentum implies the configurational and momentum marginal densities can be expressed as ùëù ùê´FG ( ùê´ ùëõ ) = 1 ùëß ùê´ exp ( ‚àíùõΩùë¢ ( ùê´ ùëõ ) ) ( 4 ) ùëù ùê©FG ( ùê© ùëõ ) = 1 ùëß ùê© exp { ‚àíùõΩ ‚àë ùê© ùëñ2 2ùëö ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ = 1 } ( 5 ) 7 As in prior development in MS - CG methodology , we define a mapping operator , ‚Ñ≥ = ( ‚Ñ≥ ùíì , ‚Ñ≥ ùíë ) , which connects the CG degrees of freedom , denoted ùêë ùëÅ and ùêè ùëÅ , and FG degrees of freedom . We consider the mapping operator linear for both position and momentum coordinates such that ùêë ùêº = ‚Ñ≥ ùê´ , ùêº ( ùê´ ùëõ ) = ‚àë ùëê ùêºùëñ ùê´ ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ = 1 ( 6 ) ùêè ùêº = ‚Ñ≥ ùê© , ùêº ( ùê© ùëõ ) = ‚àë ùëê ùêºùëñ ùê© ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ = 1 ( 7 ) Additionally , we restrict the form of the mapping operator such that each FG particle is uniquely associated with a single CG site . The mapping between the FG and CG variables enables the construction of a probability density over the CG variables , i . e . ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùê´ ref ( ùêë ùëÅ ) = ‚à´ ùëù ùê´FG ( ùê´ ùëõ ) ùõø ( ‚Ñ≥ ùê´ ( ùê´ ùëõ ) ‚àí ùêë ùëÅ ) dùê´ ùëõ ( 8 ) ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùê© ref ( ùêè ùëÅ ) = ‚à´ ùëù ùê©FG ( ùê© ùëõ ) ùõø ( ‚Ñ≥ ùê© ( ùê© ùëõ ) ‚àí ùêè ùëÅ ) dùê© ùëõ ( 9 ) A CG model which samples from these distributions will reproduce the equilibrium static behavior of the FG model , at the CG representation , with complete fidelity . To this end , a model Hamiltonian , ùêª ‚Ñ≥ , with parameters ùõâ , is introduced ùêª ‚Ñ≥ ( ùêë ùëÅ , ùêè ùëÅ ; ùõâ ) = ùëà ‚Ñ≥ ( ùêë ùëÅ ; ùõâ ) + ‚àë ùêè ùêº2 2ùëÄ ùêº , ‚Ñ≥ ùëÅ ùêº = 1 ( 10 ) The model Hamiltonian generates its own equilibrium density , i . e . ùëù ‚Ñ≥mod ( ùêë ùëÅ , ùêè ùëÅ ; ùõâ ) = 1 ùëç exp ( ‚àíùõΩùêª ‚Ñ≥ ( ùêë ùëÅ , ùêè ùëÅ ; ùõâ ) ) ( 11 ) The model equilibrium density can again be separated into position and momentum distributions , ùëù ‚Ñ≥mod ( ùêë ùëÅ , ùêè ùëÅ ) = ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùêë mod ( ùêë ùëÅ ) ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùêè mod ( ùêè ùëÅ ) . This defines the following consistency conditions : 8 ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùêë mod ( ùêë ùëÅ ; ùõâ ) = ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùê´ ref ( ùêë ùëÅ ) ( 12 ) ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùêè mod ( ùêè ùëÅ ) = ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùê© ref ( ùêè ùëÅ ) ( 13 ) Momentum space consistency is trivially satisfied by a choice of mass related to the mapping operator . 15 Complete configurational consistency would necessitate introduction of many - body terms into the CG FF . Instead , bottom - up CG methods aim to obtain a parameter set ùúΩ ‚Ä† which satisfies a minimization principle unique to each method . B . Variational Derivative Relative Entropy Minimization At this point , we now consider the introduction of virtual particles into the CG model to produce a VCG model . The VCG model is described by configurational and momentum degrees of freedom ùêëÃÇ ùúà and ùêèÃÇ ùúà , respectively . The parameters of the VCG model are separated into those describing interactions between exclusively real particles , ùõâ ùëê , and those which feature at least one virtual particle , ùõâ ùúà . We define the VCG Hamiltonian , ùêª ùí¢ , as ùêª ùí¢ ( ùêëÃÇ ùúà , ùêèÃÇ ùúà ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ŒΩ ) = ùëà ùí¢ ( ùêëÃÇ ùúà ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ùúà ) + ‚àë ùêèÃÇ ùêº2 2ùëÄ ùêº , ùí¢ ùúà ùêº = 1 ( 14 ) The Boltzmann distribution generated by the VCG Hamiltonian is referred to as ùëù premod . We consider a mapping operator , ùí¢ , which takes the VCG resolution to the CG resolution . The marginal densities of the VCG resolution are then connected to the associated CG densities through this mapping operator ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùêë mod ( ùêë ùëÅ ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ùúà ) = ‚à´ ùëù premod ( ùêëÃÇ ùúà ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ùúà ) ùõø ( ùí¢ ùêëÃÇ ( ùêëÃÇ ùúà ) ‚àí ùêë ùëÅ ) dùêëÃÇ ùúà ( 15 ) ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùêè mod ( ùêè ùëÅ ) = ‚à´ ùëù premod ( ùêèÃÇ ùúà ) ùõø ( ùí¢ ùêèÃÇ ( ùêèÃÇ ùúà ) ‚àí ùêè ùëÅ ) dùêèÃÇ ŒΩ ( 16 ) We note that consistency in momentum space is trivially achieved for all real particles by setting ùëÄ ùêº , ùí¢ = ùëÄ ùêº , ‚Ñ≥ ‚àÄ ùêº . 46 We note that the dependence of the marginal density ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùêë mod on the VCG model parameters ùõâ ùëê and ùõâ ùúà as shown in Equation 15 is not directly considered in the work presented and omit representation of this dependence via notation for clarity in future 9 equations . Since all virtual particle degrees of freedom are removed prior to model evaluation , momentum consistency is achieved for virtual particles at any chosen mass . Similarly , we introduce a mapping operator ‚Ñä , which takes the unobserved VAA ensemble , ùëù preref , with FG degrees of freedom ùê´ÃÇ ùúá and ùê©ÃÇ ùúá , to the observed AA ensemble ùëù ùê´FG ( ùê´ ùëõ ) = ‚à´ ùëù preref ( ùê´ÃÇ ùúá ) ùõø ( ‚Ñä ùê´ÃÇ ( ùê´ÃÇ ùúá ) ‚àí ùê´ ùëõ ) dùê´ÃÇ ùúá ( 17 ) ùëù ùê©FG ( ùê© ùëõ ) = ‚à´ ùëù preref ( ùê©ÃÇ ùúá ) ùõø ( ‚Ñä ùê©ÃÇ ( ùê©ÃÇ ùúá ) ‚àí ùê© ùëõ ) dùê©ÃÇ ùúá ( 18 ) As the remainder of this article is concerned only with configurational consistency , we omit subscripts on mapping operators ‚Ñ≥ , ùí¢ , and ‚Ñä as the type of mapping is implicitly understood to be configurational . We denote the collection of virtual particles ùêò such that ùêëÃÇ ùúà = ( ùêë ùëÅ , ùêò ) and ùê´ÃÇ ùúá = ( ùê´ ùëõ , ùêò ) . The relative entropy between the configurational densities when including virtual particles is then S rel = ‚à´ ùëù preref ( ùê´ ùëõ , ùêò ) ln ( ùëù preref ( ùê´ ùëõ , ùêò ) ùëù premod ( ‚Ñ≥ ( ùê´ ùëõ ) , ùêò ) ) dùê´ ùëõ ùëëùêò + ‚ü®S map ‚ü© VAA ( 19 ) We note that the introduction of virtual particles does not affect the ensemble averaged value of the mapping entropy , which can be evaluated equivalently in the AA ensemble . We next consider the derivative of the relative entropy with respect to a VCG model parameter ‚àÇS rel ‚àÇùúÉ = ùõΩ ‚ü®‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ‚ü© VAA ‚àí ùõΩ ‚ü®‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ‚ü© VCG ( 20 ) For model parameters which govern interactions between exclusively real particles , the relative entropy derivative can be calculated explicitly by integration of the virtual particle degrees of freedom in the ensemble averages of Equation 20 . This produces the standard relative entropy derivative ùúïùëÜ rel ùúïùúÉ ùëê = ùõΩ ‚ü® ùúïùëà ùí¢ ùúïùúÉ ùëê ‚ü© AA ‚àí ùõΩ ‚ü® ùúïùëà ùí¢ ùúïùúÉ ùëê ‚ü© CG ( 21 ) 10 The ensemble averages in Equation 21 can simply be evaluated over the configuration of real particles , just as in a standard REM algorithm . 24 We note that functional minimization of the relative entropy proceeds identically for real particle functions as in standard REM , and hence the recapitulation of the correlations dual to the potential energy function optimized are also guaranteed for VD - REM . The relative entropy derivative with respect to a model parameter that governs virtual particle interactions cannot be calculated in the same manner as the VAA ensemble , unlike the VCG ensemble , is not observed . We proceed by defining the following conditional distribution ùëù premod ( ùêëÃÇ ùúà ) = ùëù ‚Ñ≥ ùêë mod ( ùêë ùëÅ ) ùëù cond ( ùêò | ùêë ùëÅ ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ùúà ) ( 22 ) ùëù pre ref ( ùê´ÃÇ ùúá ) = ùëù ùê´ FG ( ùê´ ùëõ ) ùëù cond ( ùêò | ‚Ñ≥ ( ùê´ ùëõ ) ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ùúà ) ( 23 ) We note that the conditional distributions in Equations 22 and 23 are identical , i . e . , ùëù cond ( ùêò | ùêë ùëÅ ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ùúà ) = ùëù cond ( ùêò | ‚Ñ≥ ( ùê´ ùëõ ) ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ùúà ) , and emphasize that the virtual particle distributions across both ensembles are dictated by the VCG model parameters . We now explicitly evaluate the VAA ensemble average in Equation 20 for a VCG model parameter involving virtual particles , ùúÉ ùúà , ‚ü®‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà ‚ü© VAA = ‚à¨ ‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà ( ‚Ñ≥ ( ùê´ ùëõ ) , ùêò ) ùëù preref ( ùê´ ùëõ , ùêò ) dùê´ ùëõ dùêò ( 24 ) Substituting the conditional distribution as defined in Equation 23 produces ‚ü® ‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà ‚ü© VAA = ‚à´ [ ‚à´ ‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà ( ‚Ñ≥ ( ùê´ ùëõ ) , ùêò ) ùëù cond ( ùêò | ‚Ñ≥ ( ùê´ ùëõ ) ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ùúà ) dùêò ] ùëù ùê´FG ( ùê´ ùëõ ) dùê´ ùëõ ( 25 ) The term in the brackets is the conditional expectation of the potential energy derivative , ‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà . The VAA ensemble average can then be re - expressed as an AA ensemble average of a conditional expectation 11 ‚ü®‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà ‚ü© VAA = ‚ü®‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà ‚ü© AA ( 26 ) Similarly , the VCG ensemble average term in Equation 20 can be re - expressed as a CG ensemble average and the relative entropy derivative can be expressed more symmetrically as ‚àÇùëÜ rel ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà = ùõΩ ‚ü®‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà ‚ü© AA ‚àí ùõΩ ‚ü®‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà ‚ü© CG ( 27 ) Equation 27 is the central equation of this section , and demonstrates how virtual particle parameters can be optimized exactly within a relative entropy framework . We note that while the conditional expectation is evaluated in both reference and model ensembles in Equation 27 , the conditional expectation itself is evaluated only over the model ensemble . This mixing of ensembles is not unexpected , as virtual particles are only ‚Äúseen‚Äù in the model ensemble and thus all predictive modeling for virtual particles stems from the sampling of this ensemble . In practice , the conditional expectation is not explicitly known . However , since the conditional expectation is the minimum of a least squares prediction , simulation of the VCG model can be used to obtain an approximation to the conditional expectation , ùëö ŒΩ ( ùêë ùëÅ ) , through the following variational statement min ùëö ùúà ( ùêë ùëÅ ) ‚à¨ [ ùëö ùúà ( ùêë ùëÅ ) ‚àí ‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ùúà ( ùêë ùëÅ , ùêò ) ] 2 ùëù premod ( ùêë ùëÅ , ùêò ; ùõâ ùëê , ùõâ ùúà ) dùêë ùëÅ dùêò = ‚àÇùëà ùí¢ ‚àÇùúÉ ŒΩ ( 28 ) When an unlimited basis set to express the model interactions is utilized , the variational statement is exact . In practice , a limited basis set for the predictor is used , and an approximate predictor , ùëö ùúà‚Ä† , is obtained . The derivative of the relative entropy with respect to the considered virtual particle parameter can then be approximated by utilizing this predictor ‚àÇS rel ‚àÇŒ∏ ùúà ‚âà ùõΩ‚ü®ùëö ùúà‚Ä† ( ùêë ùëÅ ) ‚ü© AA ‚àí ùõΩ‚ü®ùëö ùúà‚Ä† ( ùêë ùëÅ ) ‚ü© CG ( 29 ) 12 Virtual particle parameters can be optimized in practice by first solving the least squares regression problem presented in Equation 28 to develop an approximate model of the conditional expectation . The ensemble averages of this model are then taken with respect to the AA and CG ensembles to calculate the relative entropy gradient in Equation 29 . We note that the regression problem presented for virtual particle optimization shares connections with representing macroscopic observables through CG variables . 48 In this sense , the averaging over and thus the removal of virtual particles can be seen as a kind of CG operation in and of itself . III . Implementation Equations 28 and 29 suggest that a simple augmentation to a traditional REM algorithm can be implemented to include virtual particles within REM optimized CG models . 24 First , the VCG model is simulated for a given parameter set , and statistics pertinent to REM optimization are recorded . Second , for each virtual particle parameter to be optimized , a predictor is trained using real particle features to approximate the corresponding conditional averaged potential energy derivative through least - squares loss . Lastly , the ensemble averages of all potential energy derivatives are calculated in both the model and reference ensembles to calculate the gradient of the relative entropy , which is then used to update the parameters iteratively . This algorithm is summarized in Figure 2 . While the algorithm for virtual particle optimization is exact in principle , the approximate nature of the gradient descent along the virtual particle parameter space may affect optimization and model performance . Additionally , as only the first derivative of the virtual particle parameter in VD - REM is approximated , update schemes which incorporate higher - order derivatives cannot be utilized . We note the complexity of the predictor bears no additional computational cost on actual simulation of the VCG model , which features only pairwise interactions . 13 Figure 2 . Workflow diagram of VD - REM . An initial model is fed into VD - REM which iteratively updates model parameters according to gradient descent . These steps are performed as in REM for real particles , while machine - learned models are learned to approximate virtual particle interactions first . Furthermore , since the regression problem for each parameter is uniquely evaluated over the VCG ensemble , large amounts of data obtained through computational simulation can be acquired without rendering practical implementations infeasible . Consequently , we utilize machine learning ( in particular , gradient boost models 49 ) in constructing predictors for each potential energy derivative . The features which comprise each descriptor must follow the symmetries present in the interactions it is intended to model . For the virtual particles considered here , these include translational , rotational , and permutation ( between particles of the same type ) symmetries . The features utilized in each descriptor consisted of pairwise nonbonded ( ùëü ) , bonded ( ùëè ) , and angular interactions ( ùëé ) . Two feature types were considered . For the first feature type , the set of all values in the considered interaction types ( e . g . , nonbonded pair ) ùë• for a specific CG bead 14 grouping ùêº ( e . g , lipid head group and middle group ) are selected for placement in a bin ùêµ corresponding to a pre - selected range of values for that interaction type ùêπ 1 ( ùë• ( ùêº ) , ùêµ ) = 1 | ùë• ( ùêº ) | ‚àë 1 ‚ãÖ [ ùëñ ‚àà ùêµ ] ùëñ‚ààùë• ( ùêº ) ( 30 ) The ranges considered for bin construction for each interaction type is detailed in the supporting information ( SI ) . The second feature type utilized only pairwise interactions and consisted of pair - averaged moments for each CG interaction ùêπ 2 ( ùëü ( ùêº ) ) = 1 | ùëü ( ùêº ) | ‚àë ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ‚ààùëü ( ùêº ) ( 31 ) All pairwise interaction types were incorporated as features , and ùëõ = 2 , 4 , 6 and 12 moments were considered . Virtual particle interactions , including self - interactions and interactions with real CG beads , were implemented with a pre - defined model function , in this case , Lennard - Jones , to simplify training and aid in stability during simulation . For all CG bead types of type ùêº and ùêΩ the potential energy interaction can be defined as ùëà ùêºùêΩ ( œµ , œÉ ) = ‚àë ùëà ùêºùêΩ ( ùëü ùëñùëó ; ùúñ , ùúé ) = 4ùúñ ‚àë [ ( ùúé ùëü ùëñùëó ) 12 ‚àí ( ùúé ùëü ùëñùëó ) 6 ] ùëñ ‚àà ùêº , ùëó ‚àà ùêΩ ùëñ ‚àà ùêº , ùëó ‚àà ùêΩ ( 32 ) The virtual particle parameters to be optimized for this interaction are then ùúÉ ùúà = ( œµ , œÉ ) Consequently , for each virtual particle interaction considered a predictor is constructed for the conditional expectation of the potential energy derivatives , ‚àÇùëà ùêºùêΩ ‚àÇùúñ and ‚àÇùëà ùêºùêΩ ‚àÇùúé . These predictors are then used to approximate the reference ensemble average used during gradient descent . In practice , when a limited basis is used for the predictor , the generalization of the predictor across ensembles may be poor when the reference and model ensembles strongly differ . A similar issue occurs for virtual particle optimization in ARCG , 46 and in both cases is most likely to occur at the beginning of training . While the exact predictor will generalize 15 completely across CG and AA ensembles , model predictors must learn only from the CG ensemble and will inherently only be able to generalize to the AA ensemble in a limited capacity . Additionally , previous work on REM has established the gradient of the relative entropy to be noisy ; 50 we note it was found during training of the gradient boost models that substantial regularization was required to avoid overfitting . This is related to the insufficient sampling of the CG ensemble inherent to REM , which has necessitated additional regularization strategies during gradient descent . We suggest two alternative routes to circumvent these issues : ( 1 ) defer updating virtual particle interactions from their initialized values while VD - REM iterations exhibit strong disparities between the reference and model ensembles and ( 2 ) initialize parameters in the VCG model to reduce disparities between the two ensembles . The latter route , which we pursue in the DOPC example , can be accomplished by utilizing a REM - optimized CG model as the starting point for training and a model - specific initial guess for the virtual particle interactions . IV . Proof of Concept Lipids are generally characterized by a hydrophilic head region and hydrophobic tail region . The amphipathic nature of lipids produces thermodynamically stable aggregates such as fluid bilayers , which serve as the template for cellular membranes . 51 CG models of lipid bilayers are highly desirable due to the large amount of solvent require for AA bilayer simulations , and the inherently slow lateral mixing of lipids . 52 The removal of solvent ( i . e . , a solvent - free model ) necessitates encapsulation of the hydrophobic effect , a many - body interaction , within the remaining CG lipid beads . 53 , 54 While various bottom - up CG models of lipid bilayers have been developed , 42 , 55 - 60 bottom - up CG methods have generally been unable to replicate the self - assembling features of lipids from an initial randomized mixture . 16 Figure 3 . VCG mapping scheme for DOPC . Hydrogens are omitted for clarity . Each DOPC lipid is mapped to six real sites of four types : HG ( blue ) , MG ( red ) , T1 ( gray ) , and T2 ( yellow ) . A virtual particle , VP ( purple ) , with no atomistic correspondence is then appended to the HG bead . This suggests the bilayer conformation of solvent - free bottom - up CG models may represent only a metastable state , and that the hydrophobic effect cannot be represented without some sort of implicit solvent representation . The only bottom - up CG model which , to our knowledge , is capable of self - assembly utilizes a semi - explicit representation of solvent , in which the interfacial water of the hydrophilic region is appended as a ‚Äúvirtual particle ‚Äù to the head group bead through a non - linear mapping . 42 The ( highly ) CG DOPC model consists of a head group ( HG ) bead representing the phosphocholine moiety , a middle group ( MG ) bead representing the glycerol center and ester group , outermost tail bead ( T1 ) and innermost tail bead ( T2 ) . Inspired by this approach , we utilize a similar topology to construct a 7 - site VCG model 17 optimized using VD - REM , we denote VD - REM - 7 , in which a virtual particle ( VP ) with no atomistic correspondence is placed near the HG . This CG topology is represented in Figure 3 . Figure 4 . Subset of pair potentials for real CG particles at beginning and end of training . Initial potentials ( red ) which were adapted from the REM - 6 model 42 and final VD - REM - 7 model potentials ( red ) are shown . All - Atom Molecular Dynamics . Reference simulations of a solvated DOPC bilayer were taken from Ref . 42 Briefly , 1152 DOPC lipids , ~ 45000 water molecules and 0 . 15 M NaCl were simulated using GROMACS 5 . 0 . 7 for 100 ns in the constant NVT ensemble at a temperature of 300 K as maintained by a Nose - Hoover thermostat . 61 , 62 Simulations were initialized from a membrane area - equilibrated structure according to established protocol . 63 , 64 The CHARMM36 force field was used for lipids and the TIP3P force field was used for water . 43 , 65 18 Figure 5 . Radial distribution functions for real CG beads of DOPC . Both reference AA statistics ( orange ) and VCG statistics ( green ) are plotted . VD - REM . Each pair interaction between real particles was described using 4 th order B - splines with knots placed every 0 . 5 √Ö . Throughout training , the first B - spline knot value was held fixed , and the last three - B - splines were held fixed to maintain a zero value at the interaction cutoff . Initial interactions for real particles came from the REM - optimized model from Ref . 42 The mass of the virtual particle was set to 100 g / mol . Bonded interactions for the virtual particle to the CG lipid were represented as harmonic with an equilibrium constant of 1 . 5 kcal / mol √Ö and equilibrium distance of 2 . 5 √Ö . Angular virtual particle interactions were also considered harmonic with an equilibrium constant of 2 . 45 kcal / mol and equilibrium angle of 135¬∞ . Only nonbonded interactions were optimized during training . All virtual particle nonbonded interactions were initialized with LJ parameters ùúñ = 0 . 05 kcal / mol for all interactions and ùúé = 4 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 4 . 5 √Ö for VP - VP , HG - VP , and MG - VP interactions , respectively . Due to inherently minimal sampling between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic region , virtual particles and tail groups were considered non - interacting during training . All nonbonded interactions utilized a 25 √Ö cutoff . To improve stability during training , a maximum 19 cap of 0 . 002 kcal / mol was permitted for B - spline coefficient updates , 0 . 0005 kcal / mol for ùúñ updates , and 0 . 005 √Ö for ùúé updates for the first 100 iterations . A more refined search was then conducted for 45 iterations with caps of 0 . 001 kcal / mol permitted for B - spline coefficient updates , 0 . 0001 kcal / mol for ùúñ updates , and 0 . 001 √Ö for ùúé updates to obtain the final VD - REM - 7 model . For each virtual particle interaction parameter , LightGBM was used to construct a gradient boost model to predict the conditional potential energy derivative . 49 For each gradient boost model , the number of leaves was set to 5 , the learning rate was set to 0 . 05 , and 1000 estimators were chosen . The feature fraction and bagging fraction were set to 0 . 8 and 0 . 15 , respectively . The L2 regularization hyperparameter was set to 20 , and each tree was set to a max depth of 5 . All other hyperparameters were set to default values unless specified . Information on feature construction for the machine - learned models is described in the SI . CG Molecular Dynamics . At each VD - REM iteration , the following simulation protocol was conducted : The initial configuration for each simulation consisted of a bilayer - like lattice configuration with each lipid spaced 2 nm apart along the xy - plane . The initial structure was then minimized and simulated in the constant NPT ensemble for 25000 steps with a Langevin thermostat 66 and Berendsen barostat 67 with 2 ps and 5 ps damping constants , respectively . Linear deformation of the resulting structure to the reference atomistic lateral dimensions was then conducted for 25000 timesteps . A constant NVT simulation was then run for 1200000 timesteps in which 50000 frames were collected as training data for least - squares regression and to record real particle ensemble averages . A timestep of 5 . 0 fs was used throughout training . Large - scale production simulations of the resulting VD - REM model were performed in the constant NVT ensemble with 10 , 368 lipids and a 10 fs timestep to collect statistics and spectral information . All CG MD simulations were conducted using the LAMMPS MD engine . 68 20 Results . A subset of real particle potentials are shown in Figure 4 . It is apparent from Figure 4 that the VD - REM alters the real particle interactions mainly by weakening attractive wells , as seen in the MG - MG , HG - MG , and MG - T2 interactions . Tail interactions are augmented to a lesser degree , which is likely explained by the absence of interactions with VPs . Virtual particle interactions of the optimized VD - REM - 7 model consisted of LJ parameters ùúñ = 0 . 0328 , 0 . 0052 , and 0 . 0210 kcal / mol and ùúé = 3 . 97 , 3 . 59 , and 3 . 98 √Ö for VP - VP , HG - VP , and MG - VP interactions , respectively . Consequently , the resulting interactions of the virtual particles in the VD - REM - 7 model predominantly consist of hard wall interactions with minimal attraction . Figure 6 . Predicted values for the HG - VP potential energy derivative ‚àÇùëà ‚àÇœÉ across VCG and AA ensembles . The predicted values for the initial ( left ) and final ( right ) iterations are plotted using kernel density estimation with a bin width of 25 kcal / mol √Ö . Three - dimensional radial distribution functions ( RDF ) for all real particles are shown in Figure 5 . As expected , the fidelity of pair correlations in REM is also found in VD - REM . In principle , the optimization of parameters in the LJ potential describing interactions of the VPs should guarantee recapitulation of ùëü ‚àí12 and ùëü ‚àí6 statistics . However , the absence of an explicit representation of virtual particles in the reference ensemble precludes this direct analysis . 21 Instead , we analyze the convergence of the ensemble averages of the pertinent potential energy derivatives in Equation 27 between AA and VCG ensembles , as in Figure 6 . The machine - learned model constructed for each potential energy derivative was used to predict framewise values across both ensembles . Table 1 .

Bilayer thickness was calculated from the bin - averaged normal distance between HG beads of each leaflet using a bin size of 1 . 0 nm . Orientational order parameters were calculated from the second - order Legendre polynomial for cos ùúÉ , such that 71 ùëÜ ùê∑ ( ùúÉ ) = ‚ü®12 ( 3 cos 2 ( ùúÉ ) ‚àí 1 ) ‚ü© ( 33 ) in which ùúÉ is the angle the vector each bonded T1 and T2 makes with the bilayer normal . The bending modulus , ùúÖ , was calculated via connections to Canham - Helfrich continuum theory . 72 , 73 In the tensionless ensemble , the height fluctuation spectrum ùë¢ with associated reciprocal space vector ùê™ is connected to the bending modulus through the following relation ‚ü®ùê¥ | ùë¢ ( ùëû ) | 2 ‚ü© = ùëò ùêµ ùëá ùúÖùëû 4 ( 34 ) 22 where ùê¥ is the instantaneous bilayer area . This method has been previously used to calculate the bending modulus for AA and CG bilayer simulations . 12 , 42 , 74 , 75 Membrane rigidity is a key biophysical metric in describing membrane - protein interactions . 76 , 77 This fitting was performed using data from a large - scale production run to obtain the bending modulus of VD - REM - 7 DOPC ( see Figure 7 ) . We note that , according to Table 1 , properties such as bilayer thickness and orientational order parameter stayed consistent between REM - 6 and VD - REM - 7 . However , the bending modulus of the VD - REM is less than half of the much too stiff REM DOPC model , indicating that the VD - REM is significantly more flexible . This suggests the introduction of virtual particles into the model has enabled recapitulation , to some extent , of higher order correlations . We note that the MS - CG - 6 model of DOPC retains the most accurate bending modulus of the CG models presented . This is likely due to the MS - CG - 6 model ‚Äô s explicit attempt to relate two - and three - body correlations via the MS - CG algorithm . While the virtual particle methodology presented here provides no method of optimization outside of REM , we detail in the Discussion section possible routes to work around this . 23 Figure 7 . Height fluctuation spectra of VD - REM - 7 DOPC as a function of wavenumber . Simulation data ( circles ) were fit according to Equation 34 ( solid line ) to obtain the bending modulus . As demonstrated in Figure 8 and Movie S1 , the VD - REM - 7 DOPC model is also capable of self - assembly starting from a random configuration . This suggests the hydrophobic effect is more adequately represented in the VD - REM - 7 model than the REM - 6 model , which is unable to properly self - assemble . Since the VD - REM - 7 DOPC model is entirely anhydrous , the hydrophobic effect is interpreted within model interactions implicitly through the reference statistics of the CG lipids . Figure 8 . Depiction of the VD - REM - 7 DOPC model at initial ( a ) , intermediate ( b ) , and final ( c ) stages of self assembly . Although we must be careful to describe the self - assembling nature of the VD - REM - 7 model holistically , we note that self - assembly is lost upon rendering the virtual particle non - interacting , as shown in Figure S1 . The location of the virtual particles in the context of the bilayer configuration , as well as the predominantly repulsive nature of their interactions , suggests their addition into the model may introduce a general cohesive force which maintains bilayer stability . 24 V . Discussion We note that the methodology presented here , in which optimization of a CG model is decoupled from the resolution during simulation , bears conceptual similarities to predictive coarse - graining ( PCG ) . 47 In PCG , a nondeterministic backmap from the CG to AA resolution is constructed via expectation - maximization to critique the underlying FG statistics generated by the CG model . The approach for virtual particle optimization described here has been entirely discriminative , i . e . , focused on the conditional expectation of the target functions . Instead , a generative approach similar to PCG could be taken to construct an analogous CG to VCG backmapping operator . Optimization of the virtual particle interaction parameters would then proceed exactly as in CG REM , but ensemble averages of target functions are evaluated over an approximate joint distribution of virtual and real particle configurational degrees of freedom . Furthermore , this generative approach would allow for the establishment of local information of virtual particles in the reference ensemble through the joint distribution , enabling optimization in force - based methods such as MS - CG and generalized Yvon - Born - Green theory . 13 - 16 , 78 We intend to further establish this connection in future work . Since the introduction of virtual particles into CG models is not restricted by an AA to VCG mapping , the systematic optimization presents new avenues by which virtual particles can augment CG models . Given the critical role solvent plays in protein behavior , 79 , 80 highly CG models of large proteins such as actin - related proteins , 81 HIV - 1 capsid ( CA ) protein , and BAR domain proteins 82 may benefit from introduction of virtual particles . 40 , 83 Alternatively , it has been demonstrated complex lipid behavior including gel - phase hexatic tail ordering and the structural diversity of the ripple phase are not fully recapitulated in low - resolution CG models . 42 , 84 One could in principle introduce virtual particles to lipid tails to attempt to remediate this . 25 Conversely , the lack of a reference mapping for virtual particles renders their meaning within the context of CG modeling somewhat nebulous . The representation of virtual particle behavior in the reference ensemble is inherently approximate and is represented via a machine - learned function of the real particle statistics . It is worth considering how the features inputted into these models relate to the function variationally obtained , i . e . , what features of the real particle statistics are considered important when the model is learned . Explainable machine learning , in particular Shapley additive explanations , 85 could be utilized to explore this relation . Lastly , we note that alternative machine learning approaches could be utilized in solving the regression problems presented in VD - REM beyond gradient boost models . The least - squares regression problem presented in Equation 28 relates the real particle configurational information to a scalar free energy - like function of the virtual particles . This problem is conceptually similar to other machine - learning approaches to CG free energy surfaces , 23 , 32 , 33 as well as the fitting of atomic data to potential energy surfaces . 86 - 91 Consequently , it may be fruitful to pursue similar machine learning approaches which incorporate neural networks and Gaussian processes in construction of model predictors . VI . Conclusions In this work , we have introduced a new coarse - graining methodology , variational derivative relative entropy minimization ( VD - REM ) , to systematically introduce virtual particles , having no explicit atomistic correspondence , within a relative entropy framework . We demonstrate how virtual particles can be optimized in the absence of their reference statistics through machine - learning models of pertinent target functions . We apply this methodology to construct a solvent - free , low - resolution CG model of a 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) lipid bilayer and demonstrate that introduction of virtual particles about the lipid heads enables self - assembly within a CG model that is otherwise 26 incapable of self - assembly . We additionally show that higher order correlations are matched more effectively utilizing virtual particles through a substantial reduction of the CG bending modulus . These results suggest virtual particles will be fruitful in recapitulating solvent - mediated behavior , as well as higher order correlations , within implicit solvent , highly CG models . Although our proof - of - concept demonstrates the utility of virtual particles , a substantial analysis is warranted into alternate machine - learning models such as Gaussian processes and neural networks which may prove more beneficial in predicting the target functions unique to VD - REM . Additionally , feature importance techniques may be informative on representing more explicitly how virtual particles may improve CG models . Taken as a whole , the directions outlined in this work promise to lead to entirely new , more flexible , and more accurate bottom - up CG models , along with their subsequent modeling of real systems at the CG level .

Voth * Department of Chemistry , Chicago Center for Theoretical Chemistry , James Franck Institute , and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics , The University of Chicago , Chicago , IL 60637 , USA * Corresponding Author : gavoth @ uchicago , edu Description of Machine - Learned Model Features As discussed in the main text , features for each machine - learned model consisted of binned statistics of pairwise nonbonded , bonded , and angular interactions , as well as pairwise moments for all interactions . For nonbonded interaction bins , the bin width was set to 0 . 1 √Ö for all bins and the outer range for each bin was the pair cutoff of 25 √Ö . Inner cutoffs were chosen individually through analysis of pairwise statistics . Bonded and angular bins used a bin width of 0 . 05 √Ö and 5¬∞ , respectively . We list bin ranges for all interactions in Tables S1 and S2 . 34 Table S1 . Bin ranges for nonbonded and bonded pair interactions .
