ABSTRACT Dynamins and their related proteins participate in the regulation of neurotransmission , antigen presentation , receptor internalization , growth factor signalling , nutrient uptake , and pathogen infection . Recently , emerging findings have shown dynamin proteins can also contribute to the genesis of cancer . This up - to - date review herein focuses on the functionality of dynamin in cancer development . Dynamin 1 and 2 both enhance cancer cell proliferation , tumor invasion and metastasis , whereas dynamin 3 has tumor suppression role . Antisense RNAs encoded on the DNA strand opposite a dynamin gene regulate the function of dynamin , and manipulate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes . Certain dynamin - related proteins are also upregulated in distinct cancer conditions , resulting in apoptotic resistance , cell migration and poor prognosis . Altogether , dynamins are potential biomarkers as well as representing promising novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment . This study also summarizes the current available dynamin - targeted therapeutics and suggests the potential strategy based on signalling pathways involved , providing important information to aid the future development of novel cancer therapeutics by targeting these dynamin family members . INTRODUCTION Cancer is associated with features of dysregulated cell proliferation and increased migration of tumor cells , resulting in aggressive cell invasion and metastatic disorders . Dysregulation of endocytosis in cancer cells alters cell surface expression of critical molecules , leading to the dysfunction of cell signaling , migration , survival and proliferation . Endocytosis is critical for maintaining neurotransmission , antigen presentation , receptor internalization , growth factors signalling , nutrient uptake , and pathogen infection . In many cell types , multiple endocytotic pathways exist which differ in the proteins utilised and molecules endocytosed [ 1 ] . Dynamins support endocytosis by either clathrin - dependent or - independent mechanisms [ 1 , 2 ] . In the case of receptor - mediated endocytosis , dynamins , clathrin , clathrin adaptor proteins ( i . e . adaptor protein complex ) as well as amphiphysins are essential . During endocytosis , receptor binding is mediated by clathrin adaptors that can bind directly to both clathrin and the lipid and / or protein components of membranes . Clathrin forms a triskelion shape composed of three clathrin heavy chains and three light chains , which is the assembly unit of a clathrin coated pit [ 3 ] . Not all the endocytosis requires clathrin , for example , in quiescent nerve endings a slow endocytosis can occur independent of dynamin and clathrin , however , in an intense stimulation condition , a fast endocytosis can occur as stimulation recruits dynamin , clathrin , clathrin adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) complex , and amphiphysin to increase protein internalization ( Figure 1 ) . Moreover , numerous studies have shown that dynamin - independent and - dependent membrane recycling are independent processes linked to spontaneous and evoked exocytosis , Review Oncotarget 41702 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget respectively [ 4 ] . THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF DYNAMIN ISOFORMS Dynamins are large GTPase , encoded by three genes in mammals , required for vesicle recycling and membrane fission . Dynamins can be directed by amphiphysins to sites of endocytosis [ 5 , 6 ] , where they form a helix around the neck of the invaginated coated pit . They can self - assemble to form ring or helix - like structures around the neck of the vesicle and play an essential role in scission of the Figure 1 : Schematic diagram for resting and stimulated receptor - mediated endocytosis in neurons and differential involvement of dynamin isoforms in stimulated receptor - mediated endocytosis . Using a molecular probe , such as botulinum neurotoxin ( BoNT ) which cleaves SNARE proteins , to dissect the path of receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 115 ] , it was revealed that resting uptake by neurons occurs via lipid rafts , acidified compartments and protein acceptors but not dynamin . In contrast , stimulated endocytosis of BoNT by neurons utilises lipid rafts , acidified compartments ( Vacuolar - type H + - ATPase ) and dynamin and amphiphysin [ 4 ] . In terms of fast recycling of small clear synaptic vesicles , cerebellar granule neurons ( CGNs ) use predominantly dynamin 1 , whereas isoform 2 and , to a lesser extent , isoform 3 to support a less rapid mode of stimulated endocytosis . In contrast , large dense - cored vesicle ( LDCV ) - releasing trigeminal ganglionic neurons ( TGNs ) preferentially employ dynamins 2 and 3 and amphiphysin 1 for evoked endocytosis . PM = plasma membrane , V - H + = Vacuolar - type H + , CCP = clathrin coated pit , CME = clathrin mediated endocytosis . Oncotarget 41703 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget invaginated vesicles during membrane fission ( Figure 1 ) . Three conventional mammalian dynamin genes ( DNM1 , DNM2 and DNM3 ) encode proteins that are ~ 80 % homologous [ 4 ] . Dynamin 1 is generally considered to be neuron specific , but a recent finding showed it can be activated to mediate rapid compensatory clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) in non - neuronal cells [ 7 , 8 ] . In contrast , dynamin 2 is ubiquitously expressed and 3 is mainly expressed in the testis , brain and low levels in the lung [ 9 ] . Despite sharing significant sequence identity , dynamin 1 and 2 differ in their curvature - generating / sensing properties [ 10 ] . In the peripheral sensory neurons , dynamin 1 and 2 have been found to have distinct localization , with isoform 1 located in the peri - nuclear region and 2 mainly resides on the plasma - lemma , suggestive of the distinct functions for these two isoforms ( Figure 2A ) . Dynamin 1 has more potent curvature - generating properties , and it is better suited for rapid , compensatory endocytosis at the synapse , whereas the curvature - sensing properties of dynamin 2 require a narrow neck to trigger its assembly , therefore , dynamin 2 is more suited to monitor and regulate maturation of the early stages of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) [ 10 ] . There has been reported evidence for isoform - specific functions of dynamin 1 and 2 as well as 3 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis both at the central synapse [ 11 ] , peripheral nerves [ 4 ] and non - neuronal cells [ 12 ] , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . Moreover , an overlapping but distinct role between 3 isoforms of dynamin has been shown , for example , expressing any of the three dynamin isoforms in dynamin 1 knock - out ( KO ) neurons could compensate for the dynamin 1 phenotype [ 13 ] . Although the basis for isoform differences and their functional significance remains poorly understood , each isoform has been linked to different disease conditions , including Alzheimer’s disease , Parkinson’s disease , Huntington’s disease , Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease , heart failure , schizophrenic , epilepsy dominant optic atrophy , Table 1 : Influence of dynamin and related proteins on cancergenesis Dynamin isoforms Cancer cell types with abnormally expressed or activated dynamin proteins Outcome Dynamin 1 Acute myeloid leukemia , lung and colon adenocarcinomas , H1299 non - small lung cancer cells Aberrant trafficking of nascent clathrin - coated vesicles and alteration of cell signalling and enhancement of cell proliferation ; dynamin 1 is acutely activated by an Akt / GSK3β signalling cascade to increase the rate of CCP initiation in the H1299 cancer cells . [ 7 , 8 , 30 ] Dynamin 2 Progressive prostate cancer ( PCA ) , pancreatic tumor cells , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , colon - derived tumor cell line , HCT116 , pancreatic tumor cells , malignant glioblastomas , breast - cancer cells , human non - small cell lung carcinoma cells , invasive bladder cancer cells , adult T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Dynamin 2 expression is significantly increased in these cancer conditions . Dynamin 2 is involved in the promotion of cytokinesis , enhancement of tumor invasion and metastasis . Dynamin 2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis ; Dynamin 2 and cortactin participate in cell migration by stabilizing F - actin bundles in filopodia . Dynamin 2 contributes to the bladder cancer invasion by controlling invadopodia formation ; Mutation of dynamin 2 in oncogenesis of T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ 33 , 37 , 39 , 42 , 45 , 99 - 103 ] Dynamin 3 Hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesisis Dynamin 3 gene ( DNM3 ) is hyper - methylated and protein expression level is decreased . Dynamin 3 has tumor suppressive function in HCC by upregulating and activating p53 . [ 46 , 47 ] Dynamin - related protein 1 Lung and breast cancers , glioblastoma cells , Human lung cancer cell ; T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells Drp1 is upregulated in certain types of cancers . Upregulated Drp1 confers chemotherapy resistance , induces apoptotic resistance and autophagy , facilities cell cycle progression , generates genome instability , promotes cell migration and induces poor prognosis . [ 26 , 67 , 69 , 70 ] Mitofusin 1 and Mitofusin 2 Human lung cancer cells express imbalance of Drp 1 / Mfn 2 expression ( an increase in Drp - 1 and decrease in Mfn - 2 ) ; downregulation of Mfn2 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells Mfn - 1 and - 2 induce mitochondrial fission . Overexpression of Mfn - 2 , Drp - 1 inhibition , or Drp - 1 knockdown results in a marked reduction of cancer cell proliferation and an increase in spontaneous apoptosis . [ 23 , 25 - 27 , 104 ] Dynamin - like GTPase optic atrophy 1 Lung adenocarcinoma cells and hepatocellular carcinoma Opa1 is upregulated in various forms of cancer . cell cycle progression , genome instability , cell migration , poor prognosis [ 25 , 27 , 75 ] Oncotarget 41704 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget osteoporosis , Down’s syndrome and various types of cancer [ 14 ] ( Table 1 ) . Apart from the above isoforms , dynamin - related family members also contribute to carcinogenesis or tumor suppression . These dynamin - related proteins include fission proteins , for example , the large self - assembling GTPase dynamins , related protein 1 ( Drp1 , also called DLP1 ) [ 15 ] , mitochondrial fission 1 ( Fis1 ) [ 16 ] , fusion proteins ( Mfn1 , Mfn2 ) [ 17 - 20 ] , and Optic Atrophy 1 ( OPA1 ) [ 21 - 24 ] . These proteins are essential to maintain mitochondrial fission and fusion balance to provide necessary adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to neurons . It is notable that certain cancer patients revealed an imbalanced expression of dynamin - related proteins in fusion and fission which resulted in increased mitochondrial fragmentation . In particular , reduced protein expression levels of Mfn1 , Mfn2 , and Opa1 and high levels of Fis1 and DLP1 / Drp1 were observed in certain cancer conditions [ 23 , 25 - 28 ] ( Table 1 ) . Dynamin 1 signalling in carcinogenesis Dynamin 1 has been linked to many neurological diseases for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease [ 29 ] . Expression of dynamin 1 is upregulated in a number of cancer cells from acute myeloid leukaemia , lung and colon adenocarcinomas [ 30 ] , perhaps reflecting a protective function against pathways of apoptosis ( Table 1 ) . It has been shown most recently that overexpression and activation of dynamin - 1 is selectively activated down - stream of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) – death receptors to self - regulate their endocytosis , attenuate apoptotic signalling , enhance cells survival and migration [ 8 ] . In another word , a reduced level of dynamin - 1 expression confers greater sensitivity to TRAIL - induced apoptosis , whereas enhanced level of dynamin - 1 expression results more resistance to apoptosis . Dynamin 1 is also acutely activated by Akt / GSK3β Figure 2 : Distinct localization of dynamin isoforms in the peripheral neurons highlights their distinct functional importance .

Each domain of dynamin protein is indicated as follows : G domain , yellow , is responsible for GTP binding and hydrolysis ; middle coiled - coil domain – GTPase Effector Domain ( GED ) stalk , blue , is responsible for dynamin protein self - assembly , and variant splicing ; PH domain ( pleckstrin homology ) , green , is responsible for lipid binding ; GED , orange , is responsible for ring assembling and also enhance GTPase activity ; PRD ( proline rich domain ) , light purple , interacts with SH3 - domain partners , such as amphyphisin ; N - terminal MIS ( mitochondrial import sequence ) : dark purple , is responsible for targeting the OPA1 protein ; B insert domain ( pink ) of the Dnm1 guanosine triphosphatase ( a Drp ) contains a novel motif required for association with the mitochondrial adaptor Mdv1 to the mitochondria . Oncotarget 41705 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget signalling in H1299 non - small lung cancer cells , which results in an increase of the rate of CCP initiation , and alteration of CCP dynamics , as well as triggering rapid , accelerated calthrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) [ 7 ] . The dysregulated CME leads to aberrant trafficking of nascent clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) , and alters cell signalling and enhances cell proliferation . This function is also the first evidence of dynamin 1 function in non - neuronal cells [ 7 ] . Altogether , dynamin 1 - targeted anti - cancer therapeutics may potentially to induce cancer cell apoptosis . Dynamin 2 as a prognostic marker in cancer Unlike dynamin 1 , dynamin 2 has been found to be expressed ubiquitously . It is best known for its role in membrane trafficking processes and , recently , it has been uncovered to promote the cytokinesis , cell proliferation , migration , and act as prognostic marker . Dynamin 2 is required for the abscission phase of cytokinesis . Knockdown of dynamin results in multinucleation , a characteristic of a failed cytokinesis in Hela cells [ 31 ] . In terms of endocytosis , it is well known that the endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) requires dynamin 2 . EGFR induces tumorigenesis by multiple signalling pathways . Amplification of both dynamin 2 and EGFR genes have been demonstrated to occur in carcinoma patients [ 32 ] . After dynamin 2 is knocked down or inhibited , the internalization of EGFR is delayed and reduced , resulting in increased EGF - mediated tumor cell migration , colony formation and invasion [ 33 , 34 ] . Moreover , dynamin 2 is necessary for the endocytosis of several proteins associated with cancer motility and invasiveness , including integrin β - 1 and focal adhesion ( FA ) kinase [ 35 , 36 ] . Knockdown dynamin 2 leads to impaired focal adhesion disassembly and cell migration . Dynamin 2 also regulates polyamine internalization in a colon - derived tumor cell line , HCT116 [ 37 ] . Polyamines are ubiquitous small basic molecules involved in primordial stress resistance and their uptake is increased in cancer cells [ 38 ] . Polyamine uptake process is independent of clathrin but it is dependent on caveolin - 1 , highlighting dynamin 2 regulates clathrin - independent endocytosis in cancer cells . Dynamin 2 expression was found to be upregulated in several cancerous conditions . Its overexpression is closely associated with neoplastic prostate epithelium and its poor prognosis [ 39 ] . In isolated progressive prostate Figure 3 : Schematic map for potential targets in dynamin - mediated tumor development whereas dynamin 1 and 2 act as the tumor promotors . In contrast , dynamin 3 has tumor suppressive role . Inhibition or depletion of the Akt / GSK3β signalling pathway will prevent the function of dynamin 1 in lung cancer cells . Moreover , inhibition of dynamin 2 interaction with Vav1 will stop the activation of Rac1 , and a method that prevents phosphorylation of PDGFRα - PI3K / SHP - 2 will reduce the increased tumor growth and cancer cell invasion in certain types of cancer . Blockage of hypermethylation of DNM3 by some genetic approach or increase of expression of dynamin 3 protein will prevent the tumor development . Oncotarget 41706 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget cancer ( PCA ) cells , dynamin 2 was found to regulate focal adhesion turnover , which is critical for cell migration [ 39 ] . Elevated dynamin 2 expression levels are associated with Gleason score , tumor volume , and PCA - specific mortality . Knockdown of dynamin 2 expression or inhibition of dynamin 2 prevents cell invasiveness in androgen - responsive and - refractory PCA models , supporting the potential benefit of dynamin 2 to serve as a target for development of novel therapeutics for treatment of advanced PCA [ 39 ] . In preclinical models , dynamin 2 gene silencing significantly reduced cell migration and invasion in vitro , as well as tumor size and lymph node metastases in vivo [ 39 ] . Level of dynamin 2 was also found to be increased in the cervical cancer , which might be related to the increased proliferation , dysfunction of apoptotic activity and increased migration [ 40 ] . Together these results suggest that both enzymatic activity and proper localization of dynamin 2 are required for extracellular matrix degradation by invasive cancer cells [ 41 ] . Different cell factors are demonstrated to be Table 2 : Commonly used dynamin inhibitors are not isoform specific for cancer treatment Inhibitors Molecular formula Targets Function MiTMAB C17H38BrN Dynamins1 and 2 Surface - active , small molecule , dynamin inhibitors that block endocytosis . targets the dynamin - phospholipid interaction to block dynamin recruitment to membranes but not dynamin oligomerization [ 79 ] OcTMAB C21H46BrN Dynamins1 and 2 Works together with MiTMAB to induce cytokinesis failure and inhibit cell proliferation [ 105 ] Dynole 34 - 2 C25H36N4O Dynamins1 and 2 More efficacious and has less off - target effects than MiTMABs [ 81 ] . It acts on the dynamin G domain [ 106 ] . It is not GTP competitive [ 106 ] . Inhibit the activity of dynamin following recruitment of dynamin to plasma membranes [ 83 ] Dynasore C18H14N2O4 Dynamins1 and 2 Noncompetitive inhibitor which dose - dependently inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin 1 , 2 , and Drp1 ( mitochondrial ) [ 4 , 107 - 109 ] Dyngo C18H14N2O5 Dynamins1 and 2 Greatly improved dynasore analogues , with greatly reduced non - specific in vitro binding and improved potency [ 78 ] ; it is more potent than dynasore and more specific to block dynamin function after its recruitment , with more versatile cell biology tools with reduced cytotoxicity [ 4 , 78 ] Mdivi1 C15H10Cl2N2O2S Drp1 A selective cell - permeable inhibitor of mitochondrial division by blocking dynamin GTPase activity [ 110 - 113 ] Iminodyn - 22 C23H20N4O8 Dynamins1 and 2 Binds to the GTPase domain at an allosteric site and displays uncompetitive antagonism with respect to GTP [ 114 ] RTIL - 13 C30H55BrN2O3 Dynamins1 and 2 Inhibits dynamin I and II GTPase and targets pleckstrin homology ( PH ) ( lipid binding ) domain [ 78 ] Oncotarget 41707 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget involved in the regulation of dynamin 2 function , for example , dynamin 2 is regulated by proto - oncogenic expression of K - RAS in human colon cancer cells [ 37 ] and promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration through activation of Rac1 [ 42 ] . Dynamin 2 has been identified as a Vav1 - SH3 interacting protein which remodels actin in T cells [ 43 ] and this interaction is deemed specific to Vac1 , rather than Vac2 or 3 ( Figure 3 ) . Vac1 also interacts with an actin regulatory scaffold protein Zyxin which is known to be involved in cell adhesion , cell migration and integrin function in T cells and control the cancer cell motility through integrin [ 44 ] . More recently , in pancreatic tumor cells , dynamin 2 was found to promote lamellipodia formation and pancreatic tumor cell migration by its direct binding with Vav1 to promote Rac1 activation and migration [ 42 ] . In brain cancer , dynamin 2 is a downstream effector of the PDGFRα - PI3K / SHP - 2 signalling in glioma cells and mediates PDGFRα - SHP - 2 - promoted glioblastoma growth and invasion [ 45 ] . Depletion of endogenous dynamin 2 by short hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) inhibited PDGFRα - stimulated phosphorylation and activation of Akt , extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 , Rac1 and Cdc42 , prevented glioma cell migration and tumor growth as well as invasion in the brains of mice . Thus , targeting dynamin 2 or PDGFRα - SHP - 2 - Dynamin 2 pathway may be beneficial to patients with malignant glioblastomas [ 45 ] . Dynamin 3 as a tumor suppressor Differing from dynamin 1 and 2 , dynamin 3 can function as a suppressor of tumorigenesis by induction of p53 expression and activation [ 46 ] . Interestingly , dynamin 3 gene ( DNM3 ) was identified as one of the genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesisis , from a triple combination array carried out in surgical specimens obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patients . 48 HCC patients were evaluated in that study for DNM3 methylation and expression status using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction ( MSP - PCR ) and semi - quantitative reverse transcriptase RT - PCR , respectively [ 47 ] . DNM3 was found being hypermethylated in cancer tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue , and this was associated with decreased expression of DNM3 in cancerous tissue ( Figure 3 ) . Patients with reduced expression of dynamin 3 in tumor tissues exhibited worse prognosis with decreased disease specific survival compared to patients without decreased expression [ 47 ] . DYNAMIN GENE - RELATED NON - CODING RNAS ARE BIFUNCTIONAL Non - coding RNAs are found to have a key function in the regulation of gene expression at the post - transcriptional level by base pairing with complementary regions mainly within the 3’ untranslated regions ( 3’ - UTR ) of target mRNAs , thus promoting mRNA degradation and translational repression . These intronic MicroRNAs ( MirRNAs ) can support the function of its host gene by silencing genes that are functionally antagonistic to the host , or act synergistically with the host by coordinating the expression of genes with related functions . MirRNAs promote or inhibit cancer growth by regulate the expression of target genes . In relation to the dynamin genes , MicroRNA - 214 ( MiR - 214 ) is located about 6kb apart on chromosome lg24 . 2 in an intron of the DNM3 gene , and is also involved in carcinogenesis . Although the biological function of MiR - 214 still remains unclear in certain cancers , MiR - 214’s pleiotropic and tumor - specific contribution to various cancer hallmarks formation and progression is achieved via several target genes [ 48 ] . It functions as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene in various types of human cancers . Moreover , MiR - 214 is a novel biomarker for lymph node metastasis in patients with gastric cancer and plays an important role in the development of gastric cancer in the Chinese Han population [ 49 ] . In samples from breast cancer that resistant to cisplatin and tongue squamous carcinoma cell lines as well as in ovarian cancer resistant to platinum , MiR - 214 was found to be over - expressed [ 50 - 52 ] . But , in the cervical cancer tissues [ 53 ] , multiple melanoma [ 54 ] , ovarian [ 55 ] , hepatocellular carcinomas [ 56 ] and bladder cancer [ 57 ] , miR - 214 is frequently down - regulated . A high MiR - 214 level was also detected in the non - small cell lung cancer cell lines resistant to doxorubicin [ 58 ] . In general , overexpression of MiR - 214 inhibited cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis [ 55 ] . MiR - 214 itself is also transcriptionally regulated by transcription factors , peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - α ( PPARα ) , hypoxia - inducible factor - 1α ( HIF - 1α ) , and it also is involved in the post - transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs [ 59 ] . Because of the essential roles of MiR - 214 in coordinating tumor proliferation , stemness , angiogenesis , invasiveness , extravasation , metastasis , resistance to chemotherapy , and microenvironment , MiR - 214 becomes a molecular hub involved in the control of cancer networks . MiR - 214 switching in diverse forms of cancer either by its upregulation or downregulation sheds light on the mechanism of its tumorigenic and suppressive roles and has resulted in it being a potential diagnostic / prognostic biomarker and target for therapeutic intervention [ 48 ] . MiR - 199a is also transcribed as antisense of dynamin 3 ( chromosome 1q24 . 3 ) . Hypermethylation of this region was deemed to correlate with miR - 199a in testicular cancer cells and leaded to suppression of cell growth , cancer migration , invasion and metastasis [ 60 ] . Like MiR - 214 , MiR - 199a is also either up - regulated or Oncotarget 41708 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget down - regulated in a variety of cancers . For example , it is downregulated in human HCC , liver cancer cells [ 61 ] and in testicular germ cell tumor ( TGCT ) [ 62 ] . Interestingly , MiR - 199a and miR - 214 were concordantly expressed in a human neuron - committed teratocarcinoma NT2 cell line and TGCT patient tissue samples [ 62 ] . MiR - 199a and MiR - 199b ( MiR - 199a / b ) family of miRNAs are conserved within their intronic sequences [ 63 ] . The miR - 199a / b family is composed of three members , MiR - 199a1 , MiR - 199a2 and MiR - 199b , which are transcribed from conserved antisense intronic transcripts of the DNM2 locus ( human chromosome 19 ) , DNM3 locus ( human chromosome 1 ) and DNM1 locus ( human chromosome 9 ) , respectively . MiR - 199a and b regulate endocytic transport by controlling the expression of important mediators of endocytosis such as clathrin heavy chain , Rab5A , low - density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR ) , and caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ) [ 63 ] . One of the two mature microRNA species derived from MiR - 199a , named MiR - 199a - 5p is associated with tumor malignancy . Both MiR - 199a and b - 5p , inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis through the regulation of clathrin heavy chain , Rab5A and Rab21 expression , affecting the normal function of receptors located in the plasma membrane such as LDLR and transferrin receptor . In summary , MiR - 199a / b - 5p regulates related physiological processes to those controlled by the host genes in which they are encoded and a significant number of predicted target genes for MiR - 199a / b - 5p were associated with cellular transport [ 63 ] . Moreover , MiR - 199a / MiR - 214 forms miR - 199a / miR - 214 / PSMD10 / TP53 / DNMT1 self - regulatory network [ 62 ] , which might be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of TGCT [ 62 ] . Interestingly , MiR - 199a encoded from the opposite strand of dynamin 2 gene DNM2 exerts reciprocal negative regulation upon HIF - 1α and HIF - 2α [ 64 ] . Overexpression of MiR - 199a decreased HIF - 1α and HIF - 2α , cell migration , and metastasis , thus , serves as a regulatory loop between endocytic pathway and hypoxic response in tumor cells . Mir - 199a has also been implicated to modulate intracellular iron levels by targeting HIF and indirectly affecting the tumor microenvironment through suppression of lysyl oxidase protein expression in ovarian cancer cells [ 64 ] . Apart from MiR - 214 , MiR - 3120 is also encoded from a single gene locus of the dynamin 3 gene , under certain conditions , due to imperfect base pairing . MiR - 214 and MiR - 3120 are the two distinct microRNAs produced from the fully complementary DNA strands . MiR - 3120 is produced following transcription and mRNA processing , whereas MiR - 214 is produced by antisense transcription . MiR - 3120 regulates heat shock cognate protein 70 , thus it serves as a mirror microRNA regulating endocytic function of Hsc70 and auxilin as well as their expression to influence vesicle uncoating . MiR - 3120 is also known to prevent uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles , and MiR - 214 is known to target PTEN ( phosphatase and tensinhomolog ) , which interacts with dynamin and regulates synaptic proteins involved in receptor cycling and synaptic plasticity [ 65 ] . Despite MiR - 3120 being regulator for endocytosis pathways , it is not known whether there is any direct modulation role in the tumorigenosis . THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF DYNAMIN - RELATED PROTEINS Dynamin - related proteins are a group of GTP - binding proteins containing good conservation of the five domains architectures defined for classical dynamin . The five domains contained by classical dynamin are the followings : GTPase domain ; middle domain ; pleckstrin - homology ( PH ) domain ; effector domain ( GED ) ; proline - rich domain ( PRD ) ( Figure 2B ) . Dynamin - related protein proteins also function in vesicle budding , trafficking and membrane - scission events . These proteins have similarity in some domains but might miss out several and have additional domain conferring distinct roles . Dynamin - related protein 1 ( Drp1 ) as a therapeutic target Drp1 , an 80 kDa GTPase without the PRD ( Figure 2B ) , is involved in mitochondrial fission and anti - cancer drug - mediated cytotoxicity , implicating an association with cancer progression [ 25 ] . Drp1 is also involved in conferring chemotherapy resistance , cell cycle progression , genome instability , cell migration and apoptosis . It is upregulated in certain types of cancerssuch as lung and breast cancer [ 25 , 26 , 66 ] . Drp1 upregulation and activation induce changes in mitochondrial dynamics crucial to confer the drug resistant in T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells [ 67 ] . The influence of mitochondria on human health and disease and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer has expanded to include defects in mitochondrial genomics and biogenesis , apoptotic signalling and mitochondrial dynamics [ 68 ] . Moreover , defects in mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 are linked to apoptotic resistance and autophagy in a lung cancer model [ 69 ] . It has been implicated that drugs targeting to Drp1 - mediated mitochondrial fission prevents tumor cell cycle progression . Thus , Drp1 inhibition , or Drp1 knockdown resulted in an observed reduction of cancer cell proliferation and an increase of spontaneous apoptosis and thus serves as an effective therapy for cancer treatment [ 26 ] . Drp1 is also found to contribute to the migration of human glioblastoma cells under hypoxia , and causes the poor prognosis of glioblastoma due to its mitochondrial control in brain tumor initiating cells [ 70 ] . Nuclear Drp1 may increase drug resistance during hypoxia . Drp1 co - precipitated protein , the human homologue of the yeast repair protein RAD23 ( hHR23A ) , is essential Oncotarget 41709 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget for nuclear transportation of Drp1 [ 71 ] . Meanwhile , the nuclear and nucleolar Drp1 ( Drp1nuc ) are associated with poor cancer prognosis [ 71 ] . In brain cancer , Drp1 controls the migration and neuronal differentiation of subventricular zone - derived neural progenitor cells [ 72 ] . Inhibiting Drp1 activity induces alteration of the typical migratory cell morphology into round shapes while the polarized mitochondrial distribution was maintained . With these changes , adult neural stem cells ( aNSCs ) derived from the subventricular zone of the brain failed to migrate , and neuronal differentiation was prevented [ 73 ] . Targeting Drp1 activity by genetic approach or pharmacologic inhibitors attenuates growth of stem - like tumors and lead to good prognosis [ 74 ] , thus , Drp1 serves as a potential target for cancer treatment . Mitofusin ( Mfn ) as a therapeutic target Mfn 1 and Mfn 2 are involved in fusion between mitochondria by tethering adjacent mitochondria ( Figure 2B ) . These proteins have two transmembrane segments that anchor to the mitochondrial outer membrane . Mfn1 and Mfn2 exist as both homotypic and heterotypic oligomers , and therefore can cooperate as well as act individually to promote mitochondrial fusion . Each isoform is essential for embryonic development and mitochondrial fusion , and both have distinct and redundant functions to promote mitochondrial fusion [ 17 ] . Mutations in mitofusin proteins result in fragmented mitochondria , but this can be reversed by mutations in mammalian Drp1 . Human lung cancer cell lines exhibit an imbalanced expression level of Drp1 / Mfn2 , which promotes a state of mitochondrial fission [ 25 ] . Lung tumor tissue samples from patients demonstrated a similar increase in Drp1 and decrease in Mfn2 when compared to adjacent healthy lung . Furthermore , Drp1 also regulates cell cycle progression , genome instability , cell migration and apoptosis in cancer cells . These findings raise the possibility of targeting Drp1 - mediated mitochondrial fission as an effective therapy for treating cancer [ 26 ] . Dynamin - like GTPase Opa1 as a therapeutic target Another dynamin family members called Opa1 , is localized on mitochondrial intermembrane space , where it facilitates fusion between mitochondria [ 21 ] . In various forms of cancer , Opa1 is highly expressed and indicates poor prognosis ( Table 1 ) . The mitochondria fusion protein Opa1 expression level is critical in determining the sensitivity of HCC to sorafenib - induced apoptosis in HCC treatment [ 75 ] and decreased expression of Opa1 is associated with the treatment of HCC by sorafenib , a multi - kinase inhibitor [ 75 ] . DYNAMIN - TARGETED INHIBITORS FOR CANCER TREATMENT Targeting dynamin function has great potential to produce a safe therapy to hopefully increase the life expectancy and quality of life for cancer patients . Some dynamin inhibitors have already been moved from the lab into clinical trials . The specificity and potency are the major selection criteria for basic and therapeutic proposes . Dynamin inhibitors represent a new class of targeted anti - mitotic compounds ( Table 2 ) . They are a small but expanding ‘palette’ of compounds available to rapidly and reversibly block dynamin via distinct mechanisms of action , by operating at different stages in its cycle of GTPase activity . Overall , they possess both antimitotic and anticancer effects . The first reported dynamin inhibitors were long - chain ammonium salts called MiTMAB™ compounds [ 76 ] , and then , followed by dimeric tyrphostins [ 77 ] , and a series of room temperature ionic liquids ( RTILs ) [ 78 ] . Two of the most potent inhibitors from the long - chain ammonium salts , myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ( MiTMAB ) and octadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ( OcTMAB ) , are potent and reversible inhibitors of endocytosis in neuronal and non - neuronal cells , and selectively block dynamin’s second function in cytokinesis [ 79 ] . Targeting cytokinesis with dynamin inhibitors may be a promising new approach for the treatment of cancer [ 80 , 81 ] . MiTMABs inhibit dynamin GTPase activity by targeting its PH domain , a module common to many proteins . In contrast to the classical ( e . g . taxol ) and targeted ( e . g . aurora kinase and polo - like kinases inhibitors ) anti - mitotic compounds which aim to disrupt the mitotic spindle , advantages of MiTMABs is that it is a cell - permeable , water soluble dynamin 1 and 2 inhibitor which exclusively block cytokinesis without disrupting progression through any other stage of mitosis [ 80 ] . Apart from inducing cytokinesis failure , MiTMABs also induce apoptosis in cancer cells [ 82 ] . Overall , MiTMABs are highly cytotoxic and possess anti - proliferative properties , which seem to be selective for cancer cells . In contrast to MiTMAB , OcTMAB blocks dynamin recruitment to membranes whereas the Dynole™ compounds and dynasore block dynamin after its recruitment [ 83 ] . Dynoles cause cytokinesis failure by blocking abscission , which is consistent with inhibition of dynamin 2 . Dynole 34 - 2 is a novel antimitotic compound which specifically acts at the abscission stage and selectively targets dividing cells . It is a dynamin inhibitor and is proved to be the most potent compound for cytokinesis failure [ 83 ] . The dynoles are thought to bind an allosteric site in the GTPase domain and are expected to be more efficacious and have less off - target effects than MiTMABs . Inhibition of dynamin by dynole 34 - 2 induces cell death following cytokinesis failure in a range of cancer cells , such as cellosaurus cell line SMA - 560 , Oncotarget 41710 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget paediatric solid tumor line SJ - G2 ( glioblastoma ) , colon cancer cell line SW480 , breast cancer cell line MCF - 7 , human ovarian A2780 cancer cells and HeLa cells [ 81 ] . Dynasore and its derivatives are also suitable candidates for potent anti - cancer drugs . Dynasore is a non - competitive inhibitor which dose - dependently inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin 1 and 2 , and presumably at higher doses , other dynamin family members . It also interfered with the in vitro GTPase activity of Drp1 [ 84 ] . For instance , dynamic remodelling of actin filaments is the basis for a variety of cellular events including cell motility , cancer cell invasion , and the regulation of actin dynamics [ 85 ] . Furthermore , invasion activity of H1080 cell , a lung cancer cell line , was suppressed by approximately 40 % with dynasore treatment [ 86 ] . These results strongly suggest that dynasore potently destabilizes F - actin . Notably , dynasore destabilizes F - actin and inhibits serum - induced lamellipodia formation in cells , disrupts co - localization of dynamin 2 and cortactin and inhibits invasion of lung cancer cell line H1080 [ 86 ] . Dynago are greatly improved dynasore analogues with greatly reduced or no non - specific in vitro binding and improved potency , they are more potent than dynasore and more specific , blocking dynamin function after its recruitment , with more versatile cell biology tools with reduced cytotoxicity . Among them , Dyngo - 4a is the most potent one with 37 fold more potent than dynasore [ 78 ] . Two Drp1 inhibitors , mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 ( mdivi1 ) or MiR - 499 , are potent in inhibition of mitochondrial division [ 87 ] . Mdivi1 is a selective cell - permeable inhibitor of mitochondrial division Drp1 and dynamin 1 . It enhances death receptor - mediated apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells and is able to increase the sensitivity of human ovarian cancer cells to death receptor ligands including TRAIL , FAS ligands , and TNF - α [ 88 ] . It has been reported to enhance the apoptotic effect of the death receptor ligand TRAIL in human ovarian cancer [ 57 ] . Low serum MiR - 499 expression was associated with advanced tumor node metastasis ( TNM ) stage and poor prognosis [ 89 ] . Overexpression of MiR - 499 - 5p inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro as well as in vivo . Thus , it functions as a tumor suppressor [ 90 ] . Other drugs such as micheliolide may also influence Drp1 function . Micheliolide is a guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone , which induced Drp1 - mediated cell death in breast cancer cells ( MCF - 7 ) through the reactive oxygen species mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [ 57 ] . Other dynamin inhibitors include a group of antidepressant drugs which have anti - proliferative activity , for example , sertraline which significantly inhibited tumor growth in CD1 nude mice xenografted subcutaneously with HT29 cells and has also been successfully used in cancer patients [ 91 ] . The mechanism involved could possibly be that this group of inhibitors block dynamin activity and inhibit endocytosis in tumor cells , as observed in HeLa and human neuroblastoma SH - Sy5Y cells [ 92 ] . Chlorpromazine marketed under the trade names Thorazine and Largactil among others , is a cationic amphiphilic phenothiazine - derived anti - psychotic drug which inhibits endocytosis by blocking dynamin 2 function [ 93 ] . Apart from above - noted dynamin inhibitors , chlorpromazine has been shown to have a relative high specificity for brain cancer [ 94 , 95 ] . Moreover , it has been proven to inhibit glioblastoma growth in rat brains when used in combination with Nitrosureas . Phenothiazine - derived antipsychotic drugs ( APDs ) , which are the cationic amphi - pathic drugs , also inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 93 ] . It is proposed that potent dynamin inhibition is a shared characteristic of phenothiazine - derived APDs , but not other typical or atypical APDs [ 93 ] . Successful cancer treatment requires multiple approaches to reach the most effectiveness . For example , no single combination regimen has clearly emerged as a favourite for the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma . For instance , the newly diagnosed glioblastoma is now commonly treated with surgery , if feasible , or biopsy , followed by radiation plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide , the drug serves as the first line treatment for glioblastoma . However , only approximately one - half of patients respond to temozolomide as it showed little effect in elderly patients with advanced age . Nitrosoureas only remain a second - line treatment option in single and combination regimens , and temozolomide in combination with cisplatin , fotemustine , interferon , sorafenib , celecoxib , irinotecan , or procarbazine / lomustine / vincristine has not been demonstrated to be more effective than temozolomide alone [ 96 ] . Similarly , HER1 / EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib or gefitinib are the most clinically advanced HER1 / EGFR - targeted agents for the treatment of glioblastoma . However , both inhibitors only treat a fraction of patients because HER1 / EGFR are only overexpressed in these patients [ 97 ] . The newly developed inhibitors for dynamin and its related proteins might offer an alternative option for combination of therapeutics to achieve the synergistic effectiveness for glioblastoma . CONCLUSIONS AND PERSEPCTIVES To conclude , dysregulation of endocytosis has been accepted as an emerging feature of cancer development . Significant evidence points to dynamins and their - related proteins as having an important function in carcinogenesis . Each dynamin isoform contributes to various types of cancer development by regulating endocytosis , cytokinesis , cell migration , invasion , and prognosis . In general , dynamin 1 and 2 are overexpressed in cancerous tissue and each is related to specific cancer types . Targeted therapeutics are required to decrease their expression levels or prevent the hypermethylation of the dynamin 3 gene or inhibitors selectively block the signalling cascades would be beneficial . Dynamin 3 Oncotarget 41711 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget serves as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesisis and its expression is decreased during the disease condition due to gene hypermethylation . Targeted therapeutics are required to improve its expression level or blockade the hypermethylation of the DNM3 . Moreover , the expression levels of dynamin gene - related proteins become imbalanced in cancer . These proteins are potential diagnostic / prognostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapeutic intervention . Anti - sense non - coding RNAs for the dynamin gene are bifunctional . Up - or down - regulation of non - coding RNA controls dynamin gene expression and mitochondrial division , to promote tumorigeneses or suppress tumorigenesis . Although numerous dynamin inhibitors have been developed so far , they have failed to selectively block a specific isoform of dynamin . Current dynamin inhibitors are non - selective to a particular isoform , thus , selective inhibitors against distinct isoform are needed for future anti - cancer drug development . The most commonly used dynamin inhibitors have revealed off - target effects in dynamin triple knockout cells [ 98 ] , warranting future development of isoform - specific inhibitors for dynamin as potential therapeutics for successful anti - cancer treatment .
