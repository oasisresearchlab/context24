Hanley , b Mrunali Sona , a Bronwyn L . Fox a and Qipeng Guo * a The eﬀective dispersion of carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) in a thermoset was achieved using ionic liquid as the dispersion – curing agent . We preferentially dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) down to individual tube levels in epoxy resin . Here the dispersion is ruled by the depletion of physical bundles within the MWCNT networks , for which molecular ordering of ionic liquids is considered responsible . The quantitative analyses using ultra small angle X - ray scattering ( USAXS ) confirmed the dispersion of individual MWCNTs in the matrix . The distance between the dispersed nanotubes was calculated at different nanotube loadings using the power law fitting of the USAXS data . The fine dispersion and subsequent curing , both controlled by ionic liquid , lead to composites with substantially enhanced fracture mechanical and thermomechanical properties with no reduction in thermal properties . Merging processing techniques of nanocomposites with ionic liquid for efficient dispersion of nanotubes and preferential curing of thermosets facilitates the development of new , high performance materials . Introduction Development of high performance materials by the incorpora - tion of carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) into polymer matrices has been diﬃcult because thermodynamic and kinetic barriers inhibit the eﬀective dispersion of nanotubes . The incorporation and uniform dispersion of carbon nanotubes in epoxy thermo - sets could facilitate engineers to create materials that poten - tially compete with the most advanced materials in nature . 1 The unique combination of outstanding mechanical , thermal , and electrical properties of CNTs makes them excellent nano - fillers for the fabrication of advanced materials . Successful enhancement in mechanical and electrical properties via reinforcement is expected only when the nanofillers are well dispersed within the polymer matrix . Moreover , the orientation , as well as the CNT / matrix interfacial strength , also determines the eﬀective physical properties of these materials . 2 – 5 However , CNTs , having a high aspect ratio and a large p - electronic surface , typically assemble to give bundles which are heavily entangled with one another . The common dispersing methods such as solution mixing for the preparation of nanocomposites are a concern as CNTs repel most polar and nonpolar solvents . 6 Surface functionalization has been used to improve the disper - sion of CNTs , 7 , 8 however it deteriorates the intrinsic properties of these fillers except for some very recent studies . 9 Therefore , the dispersion of CNTs down to an individual tube level in polymers remains a great challenge and despite numerous advances , polymer – CNTs composites have yet to demonstrate the expected property improvements . Fukushima et al . , achieved a superior dispersion of CNTs in room temperature ionic liquid ( IL ) by mixing single walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs ) with 1 - butyl - 3 - methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ( BMIMBF 4 ) . 10 These SWCNT – IL mixtures or ‘bucky gels’ are highly stable and the nanotubes are finely dispersed due to the orientation of CNTs in IL by possible ‘ imidazolium cation – p ’ interactions . 11 Generally CNTs adhere tightly to each other due to strong p – p stacking interactions , making it very difficult to disperse by common solvents . When CNTs and IL mixed together the shear force detaches the nanotubes from the bundles and the tubes are then a Institute for Frontier Materials , Deakin University , Locked Bag 2000 , Geelong , Victoria 3220 , Australia .

Moreover it is found that IL can disperse a higher concentration of CNTs than surfactants or DNA . 13 This molecular ordering and interaction may initiate the dispersion of CNTs in ILs and high perfor - mance polymer based composites can be efficiently prepared by taking advantage of a strong affinity of the imidazolium ion toward the p - electronic nanotube surface . In another important study , ILs were used as thermally latent initiators for polymeri - zation of epoxy resins . 14 , 15 BMIMBF 4 and recently , 1 - ethyl - 3 - methylimidazolium dicyanamide [ EmiN ( CN ) 2 ] have been successfully used as the hardener for epoxy resins . The ionic liquid is incorporated into the polymer during curing and forms a cross - linked epoxy network with bulky counterions . 15 – 18 In this work , we present an investigation of highly dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) in epoxy by combining the outstanding dispersing and hardening eﬃciency of ILs . The ionic liquid , BMIMBF 4 , was used to disperse MWCNTs in epoxy and then composites with superior mechanical properties were prepared . In other words BMIMBF 4 acts as both a dispersing agent for MWCNTs and a curing initiator for epoxy resin . In the final material , BMIMBF 4 becomes a part of the crosslinked matrix . Here , the cost advantage of MWCNTs over SWCNTs and dispersing potential of BMIMBF 4 over other ILs can provide an alternative route for the preparation of new functional materials . Recent studies of epoxy nanocomposites try to achieve maximum properties at low filler concentrations to make them cost - eﬀective and therefore , composites at low nanotube loadings were investigated . Moreover , the cost of IL is also equitable considering the relatively small fraction of ILs used here as an additive . The whole process has thus a potential to make cost - eﬀective composites to be used in aero - space and automotive applications . Results and discussion Epoxy suspensions and composites containing 0 . 05 to 1 wt % of MWCNTs were prepared using the IL dispersion – curing method . The MWCNT dispersion capacity of ionic liquids in epoxy was verified using USAXS techniques . Epoxy – MWCNT suspensions containing 0 . 5 % BMIMBF 4 were used to analyze the dispersion properties . A dedicated analysis of USAXS data at various q regions enables us to quantitatively demonstrate the rigid rod behavior and crossover network behavior of viscous CNT solutions and their cured composites . The level of disper - sion was measured first in viscous suspensions of epoxy + BMIMBF 4 + MWCNTs prior to curing . We have physically observed that , below 0 . 5 wt % of MWCNT concentration , the suspensions flow freely under the influence of gravity and above this point , the suspensions show physical gel behavior as shown in Fig . 1 . 19 This gelation implies that further disper - sion is achievable , however eventually network formation will limit the degree of dispersion that could be achieved . The gelation is apparently due to the formation of networks owing to the overlapping of individual MWCNTs or their bundles depending on the dispersion state ( Fig . 1d ) . The average distance between the two neighboring contact points in the network is the mesh size ( x ) . 19 The concentration dependence of x can be determined from SAXS intensity profiles to quantify the network crossover effect . The x value is expected to decrease with increasing CNT concentrations . CNTs can be considered as rigid rods and scattering inten - sity from stable solutions of individual CNTs or rod - like CNT bundles is expected to exhibit a Q (cid:2) 1 intensity variation . 20 On the other hand weakly dispersed CNT solutions show Q (cid:2) 2 variation in scattering intensity . The USAXS scattering profiles of MWCNT suspensions stabilized by BMIMBF 4 and epoxy are shown in Fig . 2 . The upturn in scattering for samples con - taining MWCNTs at Q o 0 . 01 A (cid:2) 1 is due to the presence of dispersed nanotubes . 21 The rigid rod ( Q (cid:2) 1 ) and network struc - ture ( Q (cid:2) 2 ) contributions are highlighted in each figure and Q c represents the crossover point . In the USAXS profiles the low Q scattering is due to the MWCNTs dispersed in the solution and it clearly demonstrates the power law behavior . The intermedi - ate scattering that arises from the epoxy + BMIMBF 4 mixture and the higher flat Q region is the incoherent scattering . Considering distinct scattering patterns , the total scattering intensity can be divided into three parts namely ; power law MWCNT scattering , solvent scattering from the epoxy + BMIMBF 4 mixture and the incoherent background scattering . d S d O ð Q Þ ¼ d S d O (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) MWCNT þ d S d O (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) EPO þ IL þ I inc ¼ I 0 Q a þ I EPO þ IL þ I inc ( 1 ) where I 0 is the coeﬃcient of the power law , a is the exponent and the coherent scattering from the solution and incoherent scattering of the background are given by I EPO + IL and I inc respectively .

The solid lines in Fig . 2 ( a – d ) represent the best fit values according to eqn ( 1 ) . 22 The mesh size x was determined by the crossover point of Q (cid:2) 1 to Q (cid:2) 2 power law behavior ( x = 2 p / Q c ) and the observed values for MWCNT suspensions in the epoxy + BMIMBF 4 mixture are given in Fig . 2e . The value of x decreases indicating that the nanotubes are getting close to each other with an increase in concentration of MWCNTs . Theoretically for cylindrical rods in semidilute concentration regimes the mesh size is proportional to the concentration ( c ) of rods , i . e . , x p 1 / O c . 23 This relation is also shown by solid lines in Fig . 2e .

The value of a can be used to quantitatively determine the level of dispersion ; a better dispersion can be assumed if a is close to 1 . Fig . 2f shows the a for diﬀerent suspensions at varying MWCNT concentrations . The a increases with an increase in the nanotube concentra - tions which is attributed to the formation of MWCNT bundles and a wide distribution of size and structures . 22 The results of epoxy suspensions containing BMIMBF 4 were also compared with those without BMIMBF 4 to see the level of dispersion where scattering intensity behavior with a > 2 was observed in all cases ( not given here ) . This demonstrates the excellent capability of BMIMBF 4 to disperse carbon nanotubes . Epoxy composites containing 0 . 1 – 1 wt % of MWCNTs were pre - pared using the mixture 4 , 4 0 - methylenedianiline ( MDA ) + BMIMBF 4 as a curing agent . The amount of BMIMBF 4 was previously optimized to be 0 . 5 % of epoxy for the best dispersion and mechanical performance and then a stoichiometric amount of MDA was employed ( ESI† ) . The efficacy of the BMIMBF 4 in exfoliating and dispersing MWCNTs in epoxy composites is again demonstrated using SAXS data shown in Fig . 3a – c . The SAXS measurements were acquired on 25 mm (cid:3) 25 mm (cid:3) 2 mm composite strips using a 1 mm beam at 2 mm intervals . The scattering profiles of 1 wt % MWCNT composites are shown in Fig . 3b and c . The SAXS profiles of composites prepared using BMIMBF 4 as dispersing medium are identical at all positions of the strip ( Fig . 3b ) whereas those without ionic liquid differ both in intensity and scattering vector , Q - values ( Fig . 3c ) . The finely dispersed MWCNTs in the epoxy matrix can be observed in the high resolution scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) image shown in Fig . 3d . The SEM images show dispersed and randomly oriented individual MWCNTs in 1 wt % compo - sites . It can be suggested that due to the interaction between MWCNTs and ionic liquid , large nanotube aggregates would split into small segregates or individual tubes and become well dispersed in the epoxy matrix . To investigate the level of adhesion between the matrix and nanotubes , a comparison in the size of the individual nanotubes has been performed using the SEM images of composites prepared with and without BMIMBF 4 . It is surprising that the average diameter of nano - tubes is B 80 nm in composites where BMIMBF 4 was added as a dispersing – curing agent . These individual nanotubes in the epoxy matrix are shown in Fig . 3e . The larger diameters observed suggest that the nanotubes were wrapped in or covered by a BMIMBF 4 + epoxy layer , indicating good adhesion between the matrix and MWCNTs . On the other hand , the average diameter of nanotubes was found to be around 50 nm in the case of composites prepared without BMIMBF 4 ( Fig . 3f ) . This is consistent with the diameter range of as - received MWCNTs as provided by the manufacturer ( 40 – 60 nm ) , indi - cating that there is no epoxy wetting or adhesion between MWCNTs and the matrix . The composite samples were further examined using Raman spectroscopy ( Fig . 4 ) to verify that the dispersion of MWCNTs using BMIMBF 4 resulted in physical adsorption at the interface rather than disturbing the CNT structure to introduce defects . The two most distinguished features of CNTs in Raman spectra are the D and G bands observed at wave numbers of B 1350 cm (cid:2) 1 and B 1580 cm (cid:2) 1 , respectively . The G band represents sp 2 hybridized carbon networks and the G band denotes the disorder - induced character .

Phys . , 2013 , 15 , 11696 - - 11703 This journal is c the Owner Societies 2013 of these bands ( I D / I G ) can be used as an indication of defect density of nanotubes . It can be seen that there is no significant changes in the position or intensity of D and G bands or the intensity ratio in samples with and without ionic liquid . This indicates that the dispersion of MWCNTs using BMIMBF 4 was eﬀective in epoxy without damaging nanotube walls . Moreover , the interaction between the matrix and MWCNTs can be verified by a peak width change in the spectra . 24 It is observed that the peak at 1270 cm (cid:2) 1 is shifted to a higher wavenumber region ( 1274 cm (cid:2) 1 ) in composites containing IL and its width is narrower compared to the one without IL . This is due to the interaction of MWCNTs with surrounding polymer chains at the interface . 25 The thermomechanical properties of neat epoxy and nano - composites are presented in Fig . 5a – d . The glass transition temperature ( T g ) and storage modulus of the different samples , at several temperatures , are summarized in Table 1 . The storage modulus of nanocomposites is remarkably higher than that of the neat epoxy at temperatures below T g and then this value becomes similar for all the samples above T g . The incorporation of only 0 . 1 wt % of MWCNTs led to 33 % improve - ment in the storage modulus of glassy epoxy at 30 1 C which is considered to be significant . The storage modulus value steadily increases with the amount of MWCNTs up to 1 wt % and becomes marginal above this concentration . All the com - posites showed higher T g values compared to neat epoxy . The synergic behavior in T g was again confirmed from differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) experiment results . Interestingly T g of all composites show higher values , the maximum T g was shown by 0 . 5 wt % composites ( B 182 1 C ) which is about 9 degree higher than the neat epoxy thermoset ( Fig . S1 in the ESI† ) . Generally there appears to be a reduction in T g of epoxy upon the addition of any fillers . However , it was proven in our previous experiments that epoxy cured using the BMIMBF 4 + MDA mixture shows an improvement in T g by at least 8 – 10 1 C than that cured with MDA alone ( Table S1 , ESI† ) . Here , this synergic effect was retained even after the addition of MWCNTs . Moreover it was confirmed from thermal decompo - sition experiments that the thermal stability of the composites was increased marginally with the addition of MWCNTs ( Fig . S2 , ESI† ) . The fracture toughness was measured to investigate the eﬀect of eﬃcient nanotube dispersion on the fracture mechanical properties .

Chem . Chem . Phys . , 2013 , 15 , 11696 - - 11703 11701 The plain - strain fracture toughness ( K 1C ) and critical energy release rate ( G 1C ) values of the neat epoxy and nanocomposites are summarized in Fig . 6a and b . It is clear that the resistance to fracture was significantly improved by the addition of MWCNTs . The largest improvement in K 1C by 95 % compared to neat epoxy was observed for 0 . 7 wt % MWCNT composites . The increase in fracture toughness can be attributed to the good level of MWCNT dispersion in IL up to 0 . 7 wt % concen - tration . This improvement is significant considering the fact that the total loading of CNT is only 0 . 7 wt % and the epoxy has a high cross - link density . Generally the increase in toughness is at the expense of tensile strength and Young’s modulus in the case of epoxy blends and composites . However , here the tensile properties of the composites are also increased at low MWCNT addition as shown in Table 1 . It can be suggested that BMIMBF 4 addition in epoxy composites has led to a higher interfacial bonding . The SEM images of the fractured surface at high magnification of composites with and without ionic liquid have been compared . The images are shown in Fig . 6c and d respectively . In the case of composites without ionic liquid , nanotubes are pulled out from the matrix and randomly seen on the surface that under - lines a poor adhesion . Although with ionic liquid BMIMBF 4 as a dispersion – curing agent , nanotubes break at fracture instead of slipping and appear to be projecting out of the fracture surface which indicates a good interfacial adhesion . It is difficult to ascertain the mechanism of fracture toughness improvement at this point ; however , a possible assumption is that the formation of a unique epoxy network structure with a definite asymmetric distribution of cross - links around the carbon nanotubes enhances the ductility of the matrix . The thermomechanical and fracture properties of the com - posites prepared using IL have been compared with existing epoxy – CNT composites prepared via other routes and are shown in Table S2 ( ESI† ) . The most common methods involve the use of solvents , surfactants or block copolymers as disper - sing agents for CNTs or functionalization of CNTs . Most of the studies reported an unchanged T g or a reduction in T g occurs by the incorporation of nanotubes into the matrix . 26 – 34 From Table S2 ( ESI† ) , it is clear that IL is the simple and effective dispersion – curing agent that can significantly improve the toughness of the matrix without deteriorating other physical properties .

Conclusions The dispersion – curing method using ionic liquid outlined here allows the fabrication of highly dispersed nanotubes / epoxy suspensions and nanocomposites with superior properties . The role of the ionic liquid is to function as a dispersing agent prior to curing and later as a curing agent . It can be assumed that the addition of the ionic liquid also has an effect on the wetting behavior , and on the interfacial adhesion , which in return has an impact on the ionic liquid’s ability to exfoliate the nanotubes . The composites at low nanotube loading showed exceptionally high fracture mechanical strength and modulus without reduction in tensile properties . The interfacial chemistry of carbon nanotubes with the ionic liquid and epoxy should be an important subject for future research . Experimental section Multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) were obtained from Shenzhen Nano - Tech Co Ltd . The nanotubes were with a diameter of 40 – 60 nm and a length of 1 – 2 m m . The epoxy precursor diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A ( DGEBA ) with epoxide equivalent weight of 172 – 176 and the curing agent 4 , 4 0 - methylene - dianiline ( MDA ) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co . The ionic liquid 1 - butyl - 3 - methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ( BMIMBF 4 ) was from Merck . The chemicals were used as received to simplify the process . For USAXS measurements the MWCNTs were suspended in a solution of the epoxy + BMIMBF 4 mixture , sonicated for 1 hour and then mechanically stirred for 2 hours . For the fabrication of epoxy composites a method based on the mixing of MWCNTs and resin was used . Pre - weighed amounts of MWCNTs were first suspended in the epoxy + BMIMBF 4 mixture and then sonicated for 1 hour . The suspension was then mechanically stirred for 2 hours using an Ika Werke RW16 high speed mixer at 1200 rpm and then MDA was added . After complete dissolution of MDA , the whole mixture was poured into pre - heated moulds and cured at 150 1 C for 10 hours and then post - cured at 180 1 C for 2 hours . USAXS experiments were performed at the Australian Synchrotron on the ultra - small and small angle X - ray scattering beamline utilizing an undulator source that allows measure - ment at a very high flux to moderate scattering angles and a good flux at the minimum q limit . The experiments were conducted at room temperature and the wavelength of X - ray was 0 . 062 nm . The intensity profiles were interpreted from the plot of scattering intensity ( I ) versus scattering vector , q = ( 4 p / l ) sin ( y / 2 ) ( y is the scattering angle ) . Raman spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer Raman station 400 spectro - meter using Helium laser excitation . The samples were scanned from 400 cm (cid:2) 1 to 3624 cm (cid:2) 1 at a resolution of 4 cm (cid:2) 1 . Dynamic mechanical tests were performed on a dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer ( DMTA ) ( TA Q800 , USA ) in a cantilever mode . The frequency was 1 Hz at a heating rate of 3 1 C min (cid:2) 1 . The specimen dimensions were 60 (cid:3) 12 (cid:3) 3 mm 3 . The storage modulus , loss modulus and tan d were measured from 30 to 250 1 C . The T g was taken as the maximum of the tan d curve in the glass transition region . For fracture toughness measure - ments , the single - edge - notch three point - bending ( SENB ) test was used according to ASTM standard D5045 . The tests were performed on an Instron 30 kN instrument at a test speed of 2 mm min (cid:2) 1 . An initial crack was generated carefully by tapping the thumbnail shape crack front using a fresh razor blade prior to testing . K 1C and G 1C of the samples were determined by testing five specimens . The tensile properties of the composites were measured on an Instron 30 kN SD tensile testing machine . The tests were conducted with dumb - bell shaped specimens according to ASTM standard D638 . At least five specimens were tested to obtain the average values of tensile properties for all the specimens .
