The original formatting of letters and referee reports may not be reflected in this compilation . ) 1st Editorial Decision 20 June 2016 Thank you for the submission of your research manuscript to EMBO reports . We have now received the referee reports that are pasted below . As you will see , all referees agree that the findings are interesting and novel . However , they also have several suggestions for how the study could be improved , and given that all concerns and comments are rather straightforward , partially overlap , and include only little new experimentation , they should all be addressed . We would thus like to invite you to revise your manuscript with the understanding that the referee concerns must be fully addressed and their suggestions taken on board . Please address all referee concerns in a complete point - by - point response . Acceptance of the manuscript will depend on a positive outcome of a second round of review . It is EMBO reports policy to allow a single round of revision only and acceptance or rejection of the manuscript will therefore depend on the completeness of your responses included in the next , final version of the manuscript . REFEREE REPORTS Referee # 1 : In their manuscript , Ubelmann and colleagues have investigated how altering expression levels of Bin1 and CD2AP in cells and neurons affects Abeta generation . Bin1 and CD2AP emerged from GWAS studies as LOAD risk factors but how they impact on the disease remains largely uncharted territory . The authors explored the effects of KD and OE in two cellular models , ( differentiated ) EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 2 Neuro2A and differentiated primary hippocampal neurons . Particularly the latter has been very instrumental in identifying a role for both endocytic regulators in the polarized generation of Abeta . The most exciting part of their story is the fact that they discovered different sorting events that regulate the encountering of the substrate , APP , with the sheddase , BACE1 . Bin1 seems to act mainly in axons where it regulates recycling of BACE1 , while CD2AP may be a gatekeeper for endocytic sorting of APP in dendrites . KD of either proteins increases the residence time of APP and BACE1 in early / sorting endosomes , resulting in net accumulations of Abeta . Overall this is a very well documented manuscript with highly relevant data and findings ; the authors use majorly imaging approaches and which are of high quality and well controlled . It provides significant progress in a still poorly explored area and a strong validation for the genetic studies . I include below some major and minor comments that need to be addressed to further improve the paper and make it suitable for publication . Major comments : The authors developed a semi - quantitative imaging approach for intracellular endogenous Abeta42 which provides an important read - out for studying the effects of altered expression of Bin1 and CD2AP . Although the 12F4 is often use to detect Abeta42 , the endogenous levels in murine neurons remain extremely low for an easy detection by classical ICC and confocal microscopy . Given its weight for the paper , the authors should include more controls for their semi - quantitative immunofluorescence based Abeta42 assay , for instance using g - secretase and BACE1 inhibitors for an extended time : in both cases , specific Abeta42 immunofluorescencs should dramatically decrease underscoring the specificity of the assay . Secondly , the authors should rule out that some crossreactivity occurs with the C99 C - terminal fragment : an easy assay could be to transfect cells with C99 - GFP in the absence or presence of a saturating doses of g - secretase inhibitor , or even better , in wt and PSEN dKO cells . The 12F4 should not give any signal in the latter cells or very low in the presence of inhibitors . I wonder whether the immunoprecipitation data are really needed . Firstly , these are single experiments not independently confirmed by other methods and require more scrutiny . Secondly , without further identification of for instance interacting domains , these data remain suggestive . I don ' t see the importance of including them and at least it does not affect the paper by omitting them . The Discussion section is rather poor and requires improvement . The authors largely limit the discussion to re - iterating on their findings without much relation to the literature , next questions or future directions . For instance I miss some more in depth discussion on the extent that Bin1 and CD2AP are potential important risk factors . While there is no clear idea how expression levels are altered in LOAD , the current data suggest that it might be likely lower expression of Bin1 and CD2AP variants that contribute to disease . How is this studied for other candidate risk factors ? Thirdly , the authors measure mostly intracellular Abeta when they evaluate the effects of altered expression of Bin1 and CD2AP . Interestingly , intracellular Abeta accumulation is an early feature in disease progression and in particular Abeta42 accumulates in MVBs where the more acidic environment promotes aggregation underscoring pathological relevance ( reviewed in Peric and Annaert , 2015 ) . On the other hand endo / lysosomal abnormalities are also among the earliest features observed in AD pathogenesis . Also Cell reported just now a prominent role for PSEN2 in contributing most to this intracellular Abeta pool , which occurs , due to its restricted localization in MVBs / lysosomes ( Sannerud et al . , 2016 , Cell ) . Although speculative at the moment , it might be worth discussing whether LOAD risk factors may more pronouncedly affect the intracellular pool ? Minor ( compulsory ) comments : Line 30 : Excessive generation of Abeta is only a trigger in a subset of FAD . In many FAD mutations , like in PSENs , there is in fact less Abeta but the ratio shifts to longer Abeta . Line 107 to 112 : Reference to fig . 2 is wrong and should be Fig . S2 ( and appropriate panels ) , no ? In this section , the authors suggest that the 40 % loss after 60 min chase is in agreement with APP degradation in the lysosome . As supported by several papers , I do not dispute that APP is not degraded in this route , but I am less convinced that this occurs via classical lysosomal degradation . There are namely g - secretases in this route as well ( see also Sannerud et al . , 2016 , but also earlier proteomic studies on isolated lysosomes ( Pasternak et al ) ) , and hence also this pool could follow the canonical degradation by dual processing . In fact , no real study exists that makes a balance sheet EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 3 between the pool degraded through beta / alpha - gamma - secretase or lysosomal enzymes and the latter pool might be rather small . Line 163 . Here an alternative explanation could be that CD2AP depletion results as well in halting cargo delivery from maturing endosomes in dendrites to mature lysosomes in cell bodies . This could explain the increase 22C11 in dendrites and decrease in cell bodies . Line 225 : ' . . . recapitulating the early endosome enlargement that occurs early in AD . ' This is too speculative here , and should be rather included in the discussion ( see major comment ) . Line 237 : the authors state here that downregulation of Bin1 as well as CD2AP results in an increased colocalization of APP with BACE1 . If so , why are opposite effects observed for APP - CTF ( Fig . 1h - i ) ? Line 254 and following : The authors measure here circularity and length of each carrer and conclude that they are increased in Bin1 - depleted axons . However , I find this set of data a bit far - fetched given the low resolution of classic confocal microscopy . I would limit it here by stating that endosomes appear more extended and enlarged ( so measure volume ) as the actual evidence of a failure of tubule scission is far more convincing with the live imaging data ( fig 6e - f ) . Line 289 and following : the authors report here that upon inhibitor treatment or CD2AP combined with Rab5QL , APP is in the limiting membrane . This has been demonstrated already much earlier ( then the by several other groups ( Schneider , Rajendran et al 2006 ; Schneider , Rajendran et al 2008 ; Sannerud et al . 2011 ) and should be included . Secondly , it is an overstatement to say that APP localized to the lumen of enlarged Rab5 QL endosomes while in CD2AP it moved to the limiting membrane as the authors cannot distinguish between full - length APP and APP - CTF . Additional controls with BACE1 inhibitors ( e . g . see Esselens et al 2012 ; Sannerud et al . , 2011 ; Rajendran et al . 2006 ) might be considered . Line 313 : the authors didn ' t study KO of Bin1 and CD2AP but KD . So ' absence ' is an overstatement . Line 319 : the link to cellular propagation of seeds is too speculative and lacks support . Line 369 : ' We uncover the mechanisms by which APP and BACE1 segregate at early endosomes . . . " Although the authors have revealed novel sorting regulation , they ignore other mechanisms that also regulate the encounter / segregation of APP and BACE1 . For instance Sannerud et al ( 2011 ) demonstrated that APP and BACE1 follow distinct internalization routes in cells and neurons which should be included in the discussion . Moreover , worth mentioning is the fact that the contribution of axonally produced Abeta is very low compared to dendritic Abeta : this is relevance in a discussion on the relative contributions of Abeta pools to the disease or to propagation . Specific remarks on the figures : - For both Bin1 and CD2AP independent siRNA should be tested on a few basic readouts to be sure that the effects are not caused by off - targets . - Fig . 1I shows a decrease in APP - CTF / APP while there is no effect on this ratio in FigS1d . Please explain . - It gives a better overview if panels S4d - e are included in Figure 3 ( connected to panel I ) . - I find the presentation of the data in figures S2 and S3 confusing . A better way might be to cluster the data on APP in S2 and on BACE1 in S3 . - Fig S4b : immunostaining for Bin1 / Ank is not convincing . It should demonstrate Bin1 in axons but most is in dendrites ( inset ) . Referee # 2 : In this study , Ubelmann et al explore the role of Bin1 and CD2AP , two genes implicated as risk factors for late - onset Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) . Both are regulators of endocytic trafficking , but their role in development of AD is yet unknown . The authors argue that both Bin1 and CD2AP depletion increase production of amyloid beta by increasing the interaction between APP and BACE1 , though they act differently in the dendritic and axonal compartments . The authors report EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 4 that Bin1 depletion prevents BACE1 recycling back to the plasma membrane in the axon , whereas CD2AP depletion prevents APP lysosomal degradation in the dendrite . The route of APP through the endo - lysosomal pathway and its points of regulation are of significant interest to the field of AD , both to understand how AD pathology develops and to identify potential targets for AD therapeutics . Overall , the paper is well laid out and the experiments are clear . The authors extensively studied the differential regulation of APP processing in axons versus dendrites and provided mechanistic clues as to the potential role of Bin1 and CD2AP in AD pathology . However , there are a few elements which need to be addressed before publication and are as follows : Major critiques : 1 . In light of a recent manuscript that have come out regarding Bin1 and its role in BACE1 trafficking ( Miyagawa et . al . , 2016 ) , the authors should discuss how their data supports or refutes these new findings . 2 . The authors interpret that the residual 22C11 signal seen in many of their siCD2AP experiments ( for example , Figure 2d ) is due to a lack of APP lysosomal degradation because APP is not sorted into intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) . However , lysosomal degradation is not specifically tested by any kind of inhibitor ( bafilomycin , NH4Cl ) and in fact the retention of 22C11 signal could be due to an inhibition of cleavage of the N - terminal APP due to APP sequestration in ILVs . The authors should specifically test lysosomal degradation using both immunofluorescence and biochemical techniques or adjust their interpretation accordingly . Other critiques : 3 . In figure 1 , it is important to show the specificity of AB42 staining , perhaps by conducting experiments in an APP knockdown background or with BACE1 or gamma - secretase inhibitors . 4 . In figure 1 , what happens to intracellular levels of AB40 ? Since there are changes in extracellular secreted AB40 , intracellular levels should be examined as well . Additionally , the authors state that there is a tendency for higher secretion of AB42 , which is not clear in figure ( 1g ) . How do they explain a decrease in extracellular AB40 ? 5 . In figure 1 and S1 , the method of normalization of APP - CTF levels is inconsistent , either to full - length APP ( Fig . 1h ) or tubulin ( Fig . S1d ) . The authors should be consistent . 6 . In figure 2 , the authors should include label of 22C11 antibody staining , and include time of chase for each experiment 7 . In figure 3d , should the y - axis label be % of time point 0 ? 8 . In figures 6 & 7 , the quantifications lack error bars . Even if they are % values from pooled experiments , the authors should express the variability from independent experiments . Data should be quantified such that the amount of variability between experiments can be expressed . Alternatively , they can use more appropriate statistical tests , such as chi - square . Referee # 3 : In this manuscript , authors examined the role of Bin1 and CD2AP in Abeta production and vesicular trafficking in neurons . They found that downregulation of Bin1 and CD2AP increased the production of Abeta by distinct mechanisms . Bin1 regulates BACE1 recycling from early endosome , and CD2AP controls the sorting of APP to the degradation pathway . Depletion of CD2AP and Bin1 increased the encounter of APP and BACE1 at early endosome , thereby increasing the Abeta production . The research design is adequate , the methods used for this study and data obtained are solid . I have several comments and suggestions for the authors to consider improving the quality of the paper : EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 5 1 ) They have shown that knockdown of CD2AP and Bin1 altered the levels of APP - CTFs ( Fig . 1h ) . As gamma - secretase is also involved in the regulation of APP - CTF metabolism , the authors should show the levels of the gamma - secretase ( e . g . , nicastrin ) in the lysates of siRNA - treated cells to exclude the possibility that the gamma - secretase activity was controlled . 2 ) It is general concern that tagging to intracellular region of the cargos affects their vesicular trafficking . Authors should examine the subcellular localization of endogenous APP as well as BACE1 in Bin1 or CD2AP - depleted N2a cells ( or primary neurons ) by immunocytochemistry . 3 ) Authors indicated that knockdown of CD2AP inhibited the sorting of APP to the ILVs . However , the levels of APP holoprotein was now altered in siCD2AP treated cells . Why ? Authors should discuss this issue . 4 ) Bin1 depletion inhibited the tubule scission for BACE1 in primary neurons . Is this phenomenon is specific to the BACE1 ? 5 ) Recently , similar result for Bin1 was reported ( Miyagawa et al . , Hum Mol Genet 2016 in press ) . Authors should refer this and discuss the functional aspect of Bin1 in BACE1 trafficking . 1st Revision - authors ' response 07 September 2016 We would like to thank you for the opportunity to revise our EMBOR - 2016 - 42738V1 manuscript entitled “Bin1 and CD2AP polarise the endocytic generation of beta - amyloid” based on the positive initial reviews . We believe that our work is a very important contribution to the understanding of the cell biological mechanisms of late - onset Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) . We would also like to thank the three reviewers for their constructive comments , which helped us to significantly improve the manuscript . We have addressed all points raised by the reviewers . Importantly , regarding reviewer 1 and 2 concerns with the sensitivity and specificity of the antibodies used in our novel method to detect endogenous A β 42 we have added a whole new figure ( EV1 ) that includes all control experiments suggested . Moreover , we included , for review only , data from Pr . Gunnar K . Gouras ( Lund University ) using APP knockout neurons . Regarding reviewer’s 1 suggestion of removing the co - IP data from the paper ( point 2 ) , we would like to ask your opinion . We agree with the reviewer that co - IP does not prove interaction . Thus we altered our interpretation of the data to indicative of association but would prefer to keep the data in the paper since it strengthens our findings . Regarding reviewer’s 1 and 3 suggestions we expand our discussion with two new subsections and discussed the recent findings by Miyagawa et . al 2016 . Regarding reviewer’s 1 and 2 concerns about APP degradation in the lysosome we have performed the suggested experiments of APP degradation in the presence of lysosomal inhibitor ( Fig . EV3C and EV3D ) . We address each point brought up by the three reviewers below and highlighted in the text all changes in yellow . Referee # 1 Major comments : The authors developed a semi - quantitative imaging approach for intracellular endogenous Abeta42 which provides an important read - out for studying the effects of altered expression of Bin1 and CD2AP . Although the 12F4 is often use to detect Abeta42 , the endogenous levels in murine neurons remain extremely low for an easy detection by classical ICC and confocal microscopy . Given its weight for the paper , the authors should include more controls for their semi - quantitative immunofluorescence based Abeta42 assay , for instance using g - secretase and BACE1 inhibitors for an extended time : in both cases , specific Abeta42 immunofluorescencs should dramatically decrease underscoring the specificity of the assay . EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 6 Response : We understand reviewer 1’s concern relative to the difficulty of detecting endogenous levels in murine neurons . Until recently the intracellular pool of A β 42 has been understudied mainly because extracellular A β is more easily detected . We have been successful many years ago in detecting intracellular A β 42 by immunofluorescence in neurons overexpressing APP with the AD familial Swedish mutation ( Almeida et al . , 2006 ; Takahashi et al . , 2004 ) . Now we have been able by optimizing our assay to consistently detect endogenous A β 42 , and significant positive and negative changes of its levels . As suggested , we have now done additional experiments to control A β 42 detection with 12F4 by immunofluorescence ( Fig . EV1 ) . Additionally , since we also use the anti - A β 42 ( H31L21 ) we included the requested controls also for this antibody . We found that treatment with the gamma - secretase inhibitor DAPT for an extended time ( 48h ) more efficiently reduced the levels of A β 42 detected with 12F4 or H31L21 . BACE1 inhibition with compound IV also reduced A β 42 levels . Although endogenous intracellular A β 42 is not as easily detected as when APP is overexpressed our previous and suggested controls confirm the reliability and robustness of our semi - quantitative assay of endogenous intracellular A β 42 . Secondly , the authors should rule out that some crossreactivity occurs with the C99 C - terminal fragment : an easy assay could be to transfect cells with C99 - GFP in the absence or presence of a saturating doses of g - secretase inhibitor , or even better , in wt and PSEN dKO cells . The 12F4 should not give any signal in the latter cells or very low in the presence of inhibitors . Response : According to reviewer 1’s suggestion , we expressed a C99 C - terminal fragment construct ( made by Virginia Lee ) in N2a cells treated or not with DAPT ( Fig . EV1C and EV1D ) . We observed no clear crossreactivity since the signal of A β 42 ( 12F4 and H31L21 ) did not overlap with that of C99 , see also below that their intensity profiles do not overlap . We also found that DAPT treatment reduced A β 42 signal despite the overexpression and excess of APP CTFs . In addition , the residual signal did not overlap with APP CTFs . This rules out some crossreactivity with C99 and further confirms the specificity of the anti - A β 42 used in this study . Moreover , we suggest reading the reply to reviewer 2 other critiques point 1 , where additional A β 42 immunofluorescence of APP knockout neurons with 12F4 and H31L21 , show no specific signal . EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 7 I wonder whether the immunoprecipitation data are really needed . Firstly , these are single experiments not independently confirmed by other methods and require more scrutiny . Secondly , without further identification of for instance interacting domains , these data remain suggestive . I don ' t see the importance of including them and at least it does not affect the paper by omitting them . Response : We understand the reviewer’s point on coimmunoprecipitation experiments being only suggestive of interaction . We observed co - immunoprecipitation of BACE1 with Bin1 and APP with CD2AP which reinforces the colocalization observed by immunofluorescence . We would prefer to tone down the interpretation of this experiment than removing it completely . We believe that together these two pieces of evidence confirm that Bin1 is associated with BACE1 and CD2AP with APP . We also believe the inclusion of this data will steer the scientific community to further study the interacting domains and show direct interaction . Thus we removed “interaction” and reinforced that the co - immunoprecipitation indicates cellular proximity and is only suggestive of interaction ( line 191 ; line 211 ) . We also removed “interaction” from the discussion line 401 . The Discussion section is rather poor and requires improvement . The authors largely limit the discussion to re - iterating on their findings without much relation to the literature , next questions or future directions . For instance I miss some more in depth discussion on the extent that Bin1 and CD2AP are potential important risk factors . While there is no clear idea how expression levels are altered in LOAD , the current data suggest that it might be likely lower expression of Bin1 and CD2AP variants that contribute to disease . How is this studies for other candidate risk factors ? Secondly , the authors measure mostly intracellular Abeta when they evaluate the effects of altered expression of Bin1 and CD2AP . Interestingly , intracellular Abeta accumulation is an early feature in disease progression and in particular Abeta42 accumulates in MVBs where the more acidic environment promotes aggregation underscoring pathological relevance ( reviewed in Peric and Annaert , 2015 ) . On the otherhand endo / lysosomal abnormalities are also among the earliest features observed in AD pathogenesis . Also Cell reported just now a prominent role for PSEN2 in contributing most to this intracellular Abeta pool , which occurs , due to its restricted localization in MVBs / lysosomes ( Sannerud et al . , 2016 , Cell ) . Although speculative at the moment , it might be worth discussing whether LOAD risk factors may more pronouncedly affect the intracellular pool ? Response : We appreciate reviewer 1 support of intracellular A β and of the role of endocytic abnormalities in AD . This topic is central to our current and past research ( Almeida et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Snyder et al . , 2005 ; Takahashi et al . , 2004 ) . Regarding the potential of Bin1 and CD2AP as AD risk factors we took reviewer’s suggestion and extended our discussion with a full separate subsection ( See paragraph starting on line 418 ) . Moreover , concerning the point on the expression levels of AD risk factors we have extended the introduction on the expression of Bin1 and CD2AP in Alzheimer’s including a reference to a recent paper by the Thinakaran lab ( De Rossi et al . , 2016 ) and on other endocytic risk factors ( line 44 ) . Regarding reviewer 1’s last point on the role of the endocytic risk factors on the intracellular pool of A β . We agree that this pool of A β is often unconsidered in the progression of the disease . In previous work we showed that oligomerization of A β starts in MVBs and correlates with pathology ( Takahashi et al . , 2002 , 2004 ) ; that A β targets synapses post - synaptically ( Almeida et al . , 2005 ; Snyder et al . , 2005 ) and that A β promotes a decrease of glutamate receptors from synapses by increasing their endocytosis ( Snyder et al . , 2005 ) . Importantly , it has been very recently reported that familial AD mutations in PS2 increase intracellular more than extracellular A β ( Sannerud et al . , 2016 ) . In the current study we mostly concentrated on intracellular A β because we wanted to determine if there were subcellular differences in A β production in axons vs . dendrites . However , our data revealed that Bin1 and CD2AP loss of function increased mainly intracellular A β . These effects could be explained by our findings on Bin1 and CD2AP regulation of A β generation , which occurs intracellularly . Extracellularly , we did not observe an increase in A β 42 and observed a decrease in A β 40 secretion . Future experiments will be needed to determine how Bin1 and CD2AP affect the levels of extracellular A β . Please also read the answer to reviewer 2 other critiques point 3 regarding the mechanisms of A β secretion . In the future we also agree that it will be interesting to determine the relative contribution of other risk factors in regulating the intra - vs extracellular pools of A β . We have now addressed the raised point in a new subsection of the discussion about intracellular A β starting on line 344 . EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 8 Minor ( compulsory ) comments : Line 30 : Excessive generation of Abeta is only a trigger in a subset of FAD . In many FAD mutations , like in PSENs , there is in fact less Abeta but the ratio shifts to longer Abeta . Response : We have changed the text in lines 32 - 33 . Line 107 to 112 : Reference to fig . 2 is wrong and should be Fig . S2 ( and appropriate panels ) , no ? In this section the authors suggest that the 40 % loss after 60 min chase is in agreement with APP degradation in the lysosome . As supported by several papers , I do not dispute that APP is not degraded in this route , but I am less convinced that this occurs via classical lysosomal degradation . There are namely g - secretases in this route as well ( see also Sannerud et al . , 2016 , but also earlier proteomic studies on isolated lysosomes ( Pasternak et al ) ) , and hence also this pool could follow the canonical degradation by dual processing . In fact , no real study exists that makes a balance sheet between the pool degraded through beta / alpha - gamma - secretase or lysosomal enzymes and the latter pool might be rather small . Response : We double - checked the references that we found to be correct for Figure 2 but indeed there was a reference missing to panel 2d which we have now corrected in line 128 . About APP degradation in the lysosome : Since 1992 , when Christian Haass and Dennis Selkoe showed that membrane APP increases when the lysosome is inhibited , several groups , as the reviewer agrees , have shown that APP is degraded in the lysosome . To clarify reviewer 1’s point and per suggestion of reviewer 2 ( major critique point 2 ) we inhibited lysosome function with leupeptin ( inhibitor of lysosomal hydrolases ) and performed APP pulse - chase experiments ( Fig . EV3C ) . We observed upon inhibition of the lysosome that only 15 % of membrane APP was degraded as compared to 49 % in control cells , thus indicating that substantial part of membrane APP is degraded by lysosomal hydrolases . the lysosomal degradation of a substantial part of the membrane pool of APP ( Fig . EV3C ) . Moreover , we now show that total APP levels increase by 53 % when the lysosome is inhibited ( Fig . EV3D ) . Nevertheless , we agree with the reviewer that our data does not fully exclude a canonical degradation by non - amyloidogenic dual processing along the route to the lysosome instead of a classical lysosomal degradation . We also fully agree with the reviewer that the contribution of the activity of g - secretase in the lysosomes to APP lysosomal degradation should be determined , but is outside the scope of this paper . For example , it would be interesting to perform these assays in PS2 KO cells given its recently described lysosomal localization to determine the amount of APP degraded by g - activity in the lysosome , since in PS1 KO cells APP degradation was unaltered ( De Strooper et al . , 1998 ) . Line 163 . Here an alternative explanation could be that CD2AP depletion results as well in halting cargo delivery from maturing endosomes in dendrites to mature lysosomes in cell bodies . This could explain the increase 22C11 in dendrites and decrease in cell bodies . Response : This is a very interesting point that reviewer # 1 raises that we have now included in lines 181 - 183 . Line 225 : ' . . . recapitulating the early endosome enlargement that occurs early in AD . ' This is too speculative here , and should be rather included in the discussion ( see major comment ) . Response : We have moved this to the discussion ( line 421 ) . Line 237 : the authors state here that downregulation of Bin1 as well as CD2AP results in an increased colocalization of APP with BACE1 . If so , why are opposite effects observed for APP - CTF ( Fig . 1h - i ) ? Response : To clarify , we would like to point out all our results : In Fig . 1H , we observed upon CD2AP KD a reduction in the levels of APP CTFs by western blot , however in the presence of DAPT , inhibiting APP processing , the levels were restored ( Fig . EV2E ) . By immunofluorescence , and by detecting both APP and APP CTFS with the antibody anti - C - terminal APP ( Y188 ) , we observed a consistent decrease in APP / APP CTFs at early endosomes upon CD2AP KD ( Fig . 7A ) . However , in the presence of DAPT ( Fig . 7A ) , the APP / APP CTFs levels increased at early EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 9 endosomes . The increased colocalization of APP with BACE1 that the reviewer refers to was observed in the presence of DAPT ( Fig . 5E and 5G ) . Therefore , CD2AP KD reduces APP / APP - CTFs in absence of DAPT , in contrast when DAPT is present the levels of APP / APP - CTFs increase at early endosomes thus explaining the increased colocalization of APP with BACE1 . The increase in APP / APP - CTFs in early endosomes is likely due to the retention of APP / APP - CTFs in the endosomal limiting membrane , as shown in Fig . 7 . This is also supported by our observation that DAPT treatment of siControl cells does not result in increased APP / APP - CTFs at the endosomal limiting membrane ( Fig 7 ) . The increased colocalization between APP and BACE1 upon Bin1 KD likely has a different underlying mechanism . When Bin1 is downregulated colocalization increases likely because there is more BACE1 in early endosomes as result of impaired recycling and since there is no alteration of APP endocytic trafficking . Line 254 and following : The authors measure here circularity and length of each carrer and conclude that they are increased in Bin1 - depleted axons . However , I find this set of data a bit far - fetched given the low resolution of classic confocal microscopy . I would limit it here by stating that endosomes appear more extended and enlarged ( so measure volume ) as the actual evidence of a failure of tubule scission is far more convincing with the live imaging data ( fig 6e - f ) . Response : We have now altered the text and now refer to BACE1 carriers as extended and enlarged instead of tubular ( line 270 ) and on Fig . 6B legend . Line 289 and following : the authors report here that upon inhibitor treatment or CD2AP combined with Rab5QL , APP is in the limiting membrane . This has been demonstrated already much earlier ( then the by several other groups ( Schneider , Rajendran et al 2006 ; Schneider , Rajendran et al 2008 ; Sannerud et al . 2011 ) and should be included . Secondly , it is an overstatement to say that APP localized to the lumen of enlarged Rab5 QL endosomes while in CD2AP it moved to the limiting membrane as the authors cannot distinguish between full - length APP and APP - CTF . Additional controls with BACE1 inhibitors ( e . g . see Esselens et al 2012 ; Sannerud et al . , 2011 ; Rajendran et al . 2006 ) might be considered . Response : We have now added the indicated references in line 304 . To clarify that APP - RFP identifies both APP full length and APP - CTFs we have extended the description of this construct ( lines 249 and 325 ) . Line 313 : the authors didn ' t study KO of Bin1 and CD2AP but KD . So ' absence ' is an overstatement . Response : We have deleted “absence” ( line 337 ) and throughout the manuscript . Line 319 : the link to cellular propagation of seeds is too speculative and lacks support . Response : We have removed the link to cellular propagation of amyloid seeds . Line 369 : ' We uncover the mechanisms by which APP and BACE1 segregate at early endosomes . . . " Although the authors have revealed novel sorting regulation , they ignore other mechanisms that also regulate the encounter / segregation of APP and BACE1 . For instance , Sannerud et al ( 2011 ) demonstrated that APP and BACE1 follow distinct internalization routes in cells and neurons , which should be included in the discussion . Moreover , worth mentioning is the fact that the contribution of axonally produced Abeta is very low compared to dendritic Abeta : this is relevance in a discussion on the relative contributions of Abeta pools to the disease or to propagation . Response : We now reference other previously reported mechanisms of segregation in the discussion paragraph that starts on line 434 . Following reviewer 1’s suggestion we have mentioned the need of determining and discussed the relevance of axonal vs dendritic A β in the Discussion ( lines 340 and 367 ) . The reviewer mentions that the axonally produced A β is very low compared to dendritic A β . In our analysis we measured the average amount of A β per axonal and per dendritic segment and thus it is difficult to conclude if the total axonal amount is very inferior to the total dendritic amount . We agree that this is a very interesting point and we are currently working on determining the relative impact of axonal vs . dendritic A β accumulation to synapses . EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 10 Specific remarks on the figures : For both Bin1 and CD2AP independent siRNA should be tested on a few basic readouts to be sure that the effects are not caused by off - targets . Response : We understand the concern of reviewer # 1 . We would like to point out that we have made more clear in the text ( line 85 ) that we used established and specific siRNA sequences previously validated in several publications ( Falcone et al . , 2014 ; Gauthier et al . , 2007 ; Monzo et al . , 2005 ; Tossidou et al . , 2012 ) and have rescued the trafficking defects by re - expressing siRNA resistant Bin1 and CD2AP ( Fig . EV3E and EV4D ) . Nevertheless , to reassure reviewer # 1 we have now performed an additional rescue experiment of the increased A β production upon siRNA ( Fig . EV2C ) , described in lines 86 - 88 . These rescue experiments directly address the possibility of off - targets effects thus confirming the specificity of the siRNAs used in this study . Fig . 1I shows a decrease in APP - CTF / APP while there is no effect on this ratio in FigS1d . Please explain . Response : The decrease of APP - CTF / APP upon CD2AP KD could be caused by either increased degradation of APP CTFs or by increased processing . We found that inhibition of gamma - secretase rescued the defect as shown in Fig EV2E suggesting that increased processing is responsible for the decrease in CTFs . It gives a better overview if panels S4d - e are included in Figure 3 ( connected to panel I ) . Response : We have now included the panel S4d in figure 3 as panel 3I and panel S4E in figure 4 as panel 4J . I find the presentation of the data in figures S2 and S3 confusing . A better way might be to cluster the data on APP in S2 and on BACE1 in S3 . Response : Following reviewer 1’s suggestion , we have clustered the data on APP and on BACE1 in former Fig . S2 and Fig . S3 of the manuscript in Fig . EV3 and Fig . EV4 of the revised manuscript . Fig S4b : Immunostaining for Bin1 / Ank is not convincing . It should demonstrate Bin1 in axons but most is in dendrites ( inset ) . Response : We agree with the reviewer that the visualization of Bin1 in axons was not straightforward . We have included a new immunofluorescence to substitute panel b . We believe that the visualization of Bin1 in axons is now clearer . Importantly Bin1 localization in axons is additionally evidenced by the 3 - fold enrichment of Bin1 in axonal endosomes ( see Fig 3I , 3J and 3K of the revised version ) . Referee # 2 : In this study , Ubelmann et al explore the role of Bin1 and CD2AP , two genes implicated as risk factors for late - onset Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) . Both are regulators of endocytic trafficking , but their role in development of AD is yet unknown . The authors argue that both Bin1 and CD2AP depletion increase production of amyloid beta by increasing the interaction between APP and BACE1 , though they act differently in the dendritic and axonal compartments . The authors report that Bin1 depletion prevents BACE1 recycling back to the plasma membrane in the axon , whereas CD2AP depletion prevents APP lysosomal degradation in the dendrite . The route of APP through the endo - lysosomal pathway and its points of regulation are of significant interest to the field of AD , both to understand how AD pathology develops and to identify potential targets for AD therapeutics . Overall , the paper is well laid out and the experiments are clear . The authors extensively studied the differential regulation of APP processing in axons versus dendrites and provided mechanistic clues as to the potential role of Bin1 and CD2AP in AD pathology . However , there are a few elements which need to be addressed before publication and are as follows : EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 11 Major critiques : In light of a recent manuscript that have come out regarding Bin1 and its role in BACE1 trafficking ( Miyagawa et . al . , 2016 ) , the authors should discuss how their data supports or refutes these new findings . Response : We fully agree with reviewer # 2 that results from Miyagawa et al . , published after we sent our paper to EMBO reports , should be discussed . In Miyagawa et al . 2016 , Bin1 depletion induced BACE1 accumulation in early endosomes of primary neurons floxed out for Bin1 during 6 days by Cre incubation . We similarly observed BACE1 accumulation in early endosomes of primary neurons treated with siRNA for Bin1 for 3 days . We both hypothesized that BACE1 accumulation in early endosomes could result from a defect in recycling and / or degradation . Miyagawa et al . concluded that there was a defect in BACE1 degradation , based on increased BACE1 total levels and decreased colocalization with LAMP1 ( by fractionation ) . A shortcoming of their study is however that pulse - chase analysis of BACE1 degradation that would more rigorously analyse BACE1 degradation was not performed . Moreover , BACE1 recycling was not examined . We performed rigorous pulse - chase analysis of BACE1 recycling and degradation in n2a cells and primary neurons as well as analysis of BACE1 total levels . We observed a defect in BACE1 recycling in both cell types ( Fig . 2I - L , 4C and 4D ) . However , pulse - chase analysis of BACE1 revealed no difference ( Fig . EV4C ) neither western blot analysis of BACE1 total levels ( Fig . EV6C ) . Together our data are not consistent with a defect in BACE1 degradation . This could be due to differences in methodology and in the time of Bin1 depletion . Miyagawa et al . performed 6 days of complete Bin1 deletion while we did knockdown for 72h of transient siRNA transfection . Maybe the extra 3 days of Bin1 depletion are necessary for a defective BACE1 recycling to affect BACE1 total levels . Miyagawa et al . do not describe a mechanism for how Bin1 controls BACE1 degradation while we provide direct evidence for Bin1 to function in the scission of BACE1 tubules necessary for efficient recycling from early endosomes . We have now mentioned and discussed Miyagawa et al . results in lines 116 of the results and 379 of the discussion . The authors interpret that the residual 22C11 signal seen in many of their siCD2AP experiments ( for example , Figure 2d ) is due to a lack of APP lysosomal degradation because APP is not sorted into intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) . However , lysosomal degradation is not specifically tested by any kind of inhibitor ( bafilomycin , NH4Cl ) and in fact the retention of 22C11 signal could be due to an inhibition of cleavage of the N - terminal APP due to APP sequestration in ILVs . The authors should specifically test lysosomal degradation using both immunofluorescence ane biochemical techniques or adjust their interpretation accordingly . Response : We thank reviewer 2 and reviewer 1 for raising this point . We have now specifically tested and found APP lysosomal degradation inhibited upon leupeptin treatment using both immunofluorescence and biochemical techniques ( Fig . EV3C and EV3D ) . Please also see minor comments point 2 from reviewer 1 . We would also like to point out that 22C11 retention was observed after leupeptin treatment similarly to treatment with siCD2AP , supporting that the residual 22C11 observed likely results from delayed lysosomal degradation . Moreover , please note that upon CD2AP depletion APP / APP CTFs was observed retained at the endosomal limiting membrane and not sequestered in ILVs ( Fig . 7 ) . Other critiques : In figure 1 , it is important to show the specificity of AB42 staining , perhaps by conducting experiments in an APP knockdown background or with BACE1 or gamma - secretase inhibitors . Response : Both 12F4 and H31L21 are monoclonal antibodies raised against the c - terminus of A β 42 , that in their specifications refer to be specific and able to recognize A β 42 from APP , APP - CTFs and A β 40 . We decided to use these two antibodies because they had been previously used in 246 publications for 12f4 and 18 for H31L21 . We nevertheless acknowledge the points raised by reviewers 1 and 2 and thus have performed all the suggested experiments . 1 . We performed A β 42 immunofluorescence with both antibodies in the presence of prolonged treatment ( 48h ) with DAPT ( suggested by reviewer 1 ) , and , as suggested by reviewers 1 and 2 , with EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 12 BACE inhibitor ( Fig EV1B ) . Following the advice of reviewer 1 we also performed immunostainings on cells overexpressing the beta - cleaved APP - CTF ( C99 ) in presence or absence of DAPT to rule out any cross - reactivity of the antibodies with APP cleavage byproducts ( Fig . EV1C and EV1D ) . 2 . Additionally , Prof . Gunnar Gouras from Lund University , a renowned AD researcher , uses these antibodies and his post - doc Isak Martinsson had performed immunofluorescence experiments with APP knockout primary neurons . G . Gouras agreed to share with us and the reviewers some of his unpublished results . The figure is shown below . All these experiments show residual labelling with both antibodies , suggestive of background noise , confirming the high specificity of both these antibodies for A β 42 . ( Courtesy of Isak Martinsson and Gunnar K . Gouras , Lund University ) EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 13 In figure 1 , what happens to intracellular levels of AB40 ? Since there are changes in extracellular secreted AB40 , intracellular levels should be examined as well . Response : Following this excellent suggestion by reviewer 2 we measured intracellular A β 40 in N2a cells depleted for Bin1 or CD2AP by immunofluorescence using an antibody specific for A β 40 ( Fig EV2D ) . A β 40 increased intracellularly upon Bin1 knockdown and remained unchanged upon CD2AP knockdown ( line 96 ) . Additionally , the authors state that there is a tendency for higher secretion of AB42 , which is not clear in figure ( 1g ) . How do they explain a decrease in extracellular AB40 ? Response : We agree that a tendency for higher secretion of A β 42 is not clear in Fig . 1G . We have re - written the sentence in line 94 . The mechanisms of A β 40 secretion are poorly characterized . As recently reviewed by Paul Gleeson , several recycling pathways can contribute to the secretion of A β 40 . Briefly we can speculate that once produced at early endosomes A β 40 could be carried to the extracellular space by exocytosis of recycling carriers originating from early endosomes or by release of exosomes from MVBs where A β 40 could accumulate ( Rajendran et al . , 2006 ; Toh and Gleeson , 2016 ) . Bin1 depletion by inhibiting recycling to the plasma membrane would affect not only BACE1 but also A β 40 . CD2AP depletion by potentially inhibiting ILVs formation at MVBs would impair APP degradation , inhibit exosome formation and thus secretion of A β 40 - associated with exosomes . We have now discussed this ( lines 374 and 403 ) . In figure 1 and S1 , the method of normalization of APP - CTF levels is inconsistent , either to full - length APP ( Fig . 1h ) or tubulin ( Fig . S1d ) . The authors should be consistent . Response : We have now changed the method of normalization in Fig . EV1D to full length APP as in Fig . 1H to keep the results consistent as pointed out by reviewer 2 . In figure 2 , the authors should include label of 22C11 antibody staining , and include time of chase for each experiment Response : We have included the label 22C11 and M1 , the anti - Flag - BACE1 antibody used and the respective times of pulse and chase for each experiment . In figure 3d , should the y - axis label be % of time point 0 ? Response : We recognize reviewer 2’s point . Ideally we would normalize it to time zero as we did when we measured the total amount of endocytosis per N2a cells ( Fig . 2E ) or by biotinylation of primary neurons ( Fig . 3F ) . However , there is a technical limitation inherent to the imaging of neurons at highest numerical aperture , necessary to best capture fluorescence intensity . The associated smaller field of view prevents us to acquire the whole cell given the large size of neurons . The solution was to measure the amount of endocytosis per 20 um of dendrite or axon that precludes the normalization to the total amount endocytosed per dendrite , per axon or per cell at time zero . We have nevertheless included below the quantification of APP levels after 60 min relative to time 0 but we think it is more correct to include in the paper the normalization to siControl levels . EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 14 In figures 6 & 7 , the quantifications lack error bars . Even if they are % values from pooled experiments , the authors should express the variability from independent experiments . Data should be quantified such that the amount of variability between experiments can be expressed . Alternatively , they can use more appropriate statistical tests , such as chi - square . Response : Fig . 6B , 7D and 7I now show the variability of the independent experiments analyzed . Referee # 3 : In this manuscript , authors examined the role of Bin1 and CD2AP in Abeta production and vesicular trafficking in neurons . They found that downregulation of Bin1 and CD2AP increased the production of Abeta by distinct mechanisms . Bin1 regulates BACE1 recycling from early endosome , and CD2AP controls the sorting of APP to the degradation pathway . Depletion of CD2AP and Bin1 increased the encounter of APP and BACE1 at early endosome , thereby increasing the Abeta production . The research design is adequate , the methods used for this study and data obtained are solid . I have several comments and suggestions for the authors to consider improving the quality of the paper : 1 ) They have shown that knockdown of CD2AP and Bin1 altered the levels of APP - CTFs ( Fig . 1h ) . As gamma - secretase is also involved in the regulation of APP - CTF metabolism , the authors should show the levels of the gamma - secretase ( e . g . , nicastrin ) in the lysates of siRNA - treated cells to exclude the possibility that the gamma - secretase activity was controlled . Response : We thank the reviewer for raising this point . We have analyzed the levels of nicastrin as suggested in the lysates of siRNA - treated cells and found no significant alterations in the levels of nicastrin upon siRNA treatment ( See Fig . EV2F ) , suggesting that gamma - secretase is unaltered upon Bin1 or CD2AP siRNA treatment ( line 107 ) . 2 ) It is general concern that tagging to intracellular region of the cargos affects their vesicular trafficking . Authors should examine the subcellular localization of endogenous APP as well as BACE1 in Bin1 or CD2AP - depleted N2a cells ( or primary neurons ) by immunocytochemistry . Response : Reviewer 3’s concern with the study of exogenous proteins is a valid point , that we have tried to address by analyzing endogenous proteins whenever possible . Concerning APP , we analysed endogenous APP processing ( Fig . 1H , 1I , EV2E ) ; endogenous APP degradation upon plasma membrane biotinylation ( Fig . 3E and 3F ) ; endogenous co - ip with CD2AP ( Fig . 3G ) ; and importantly , we analyzed the subcellular localization of endogenous APP to early endosomes of CD2AP - depleted primary neurons by immunofluorescence and spinning - disk confocal microscopy ( Fig . 7A and 7B ) and dSTORM super - resolution microscopy ( Fig . 7H , 7I and 7J ) . These results were consistent with the ones obtained using exogenous expression of APP , indicating that tagging does not significantly affect APP vesicular trafficking . Regarding endogenous BACE1 , we analyzed endogenous BACE1 total levels by western blot ( Fig . S6C ) ; and detected an endogenous co - ip with Bin1 ( Fig . 4E ) . Despite working for western blot the polyclonal anti - BACE1 ( Thermo Scientific PA1 - 757 ) used gave by immunofluorescence an ubiquitous signal inconsistent with the established BACE1 endocytic localization and BACE1 endocytic activity ( Buggia - Prévot et al . , 2013 ; John et al . , 2014 ; Vassar et al . , 1999 ; Vetrivel et al . , 2009 ; Yan et al . , 2001 ) ( see below ) . To further try to address reviewer 3 suggestion we tested another antibody , a monoclonal against the ectodomain of BACE1 ( R & D Systems clone 137612 ) . Unfortunately , similar results were obtained ( see below ) . Additionally , we pulsed live neurons with this antibody hoping to detect endogenous BACE1 endocytosis but again these experiments were unsuccessful since endocytosed fluorescent transferrin could be detected but not anti - BACE1 ( shown below ) . It is possible that the antigens recognized by these antibodies are not exposed when the proteins are kept in their native conformation during immunofluorescence but not during western blot in denaturing conditions . We suspect that other researchers encountered similar difficulties because in all BACE1 trafficking papers , that we could find , the endogenous protein trafficking was not reported ( Bauereiss et al . , 2015 ; Buggia - Prévot et al . , 2013 ; Chia et al . , 2013 ; Das et al . , 2013 ; Koh et al . , 2005 ; Sannerud et al . , 2011 ; Udayar et al . , 2013 ; Vassar et al . , 1999 ; Wu et al . , 2011 ) . EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 15 3 ) Authors indicated that knockdown of CD2AP inhibited the sorting of APP to the ILVs . However , the levels of APP holoprotein was now altered in siCD2AP treated cells . Why ? Authors should discuss this issue . Response : We assume the referee refers to the levels of APP holoprotein not being altered in siCD2AP - treated cells ( Fig . 1H ) . To clarify since we used biotinylation of surface proteins that were subsequently chased for degradation we are in fact analyzing specifically the degradation of the membrane pool of APP . We have re - written this in the results ( lines 188 ) . However , we found that CD2AP control of membrane APP degradation in dendrites was not sufficient to alter APP levels at steady state . This could be due to the abundance of APP in other cellular locations and / or to the incomplete block of APP degradation . Nevertheless , we could pinpoint CD2AP function to dendritic early endosomes identifying a novel dendritic specific control of APP degradation . To reinforce the specificity of CD2AP function , we have re - written the discussion ( line 398 ) . 4 ) Bin1 depletion inhibited the tubule scission for BACE1 in primary neurons . Is this phenomenon is specific to the BACE1 ? Response : Bin1 function in scission has not been previously reported . In vitro , Bin1 alone can recruit dynamin to tubulated lipidic bilayers ( Leprince et al . , 1997 ; Nicot et al . , 2007 ; Picas et al . , 2014 ) and dynamin is known for its scission capacity ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) . This evidence supports a role for Bin1 in scission of tubules independent of the presence of cargo . However , some cargo specificity exists in vivo since we observed that the recycling of APP is not altered by Bin1 depletion ( Fig EV3B ) . Moreover , Bin1 depletion show transferrin recycling defects ( Pant et al . , 2009 ) . The CLAP domain specific to neuronal Bin1 could also confer further specificity to Bin1 control of BACE1 , since only the neuronal isoform rescued the BACE1 recycling defect observed upon Bin1 depletion ( Fig EV4D ) . Together these data indicate that the tubules formed upon Bin1 / dynamin scission likely contain BACE1 and transferrin but not APP . Regarding this point we have extended the discussion on Bin1 function ( line 374 ) . 5 ) Recently , similar result for Bin1 was reported ( Miyagawa et al . , Hum Mol Genet 2016 in press ) . Authors should refer this and discuss the functional aspect of Bin1 in BACE1 trafficking . Response : Reviewer 2 also called our attention to this paper , can you please see our answer to reviewer 2 major point 1 . In addition , Miyagawa et al . 2016 show a direct interaction of Bin1 with BACE1 further supporting Bin1 specificity as discussed in point 4 . Although the identified EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 16 interacting domain ( BAR domain ) , present in all Bin1 isoforms , is inconsistent with the inability of ubiquitous Bin1 to rescue the BACE1 recycling phenotype ( Fig . EV4D ) . Subsequent studies will be necessary to clarify this discrepancy . We look forward to seeing our work accepted for publication in EMBO reports . We have a couple of figures that we will send in the next few days for you to consider for the cover . If you have any further questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . 2nd Editorial Decision 11 October 2016 We have finally received all referee comments on your revised manuscript that are included below . While referees 2 and 3 did not raise concerns , referee 1 is still not convinced by the antibodies used and the coIP data . Upon cross - commenting , referee 3 agrees with referee 1 and suggests experiments to address the concerns . These comments are also pasted below . We usually only allow one round of revision . However , in this case , all referees indicate in the manuscript summary table that the findings are novel and interesting , and we would like to publish your study if the remaining concerns can be satisfactorily addressed . I would therefore like to give you the opportunity to do so , if you think this can be done in a reasonable timeframe . It is our journal policy that manuscripts should be accepted at the latest 6 months after a first decision was made , which was in June in your case . We should therefore accept your manuscript before the end of December . Please let me know whether you think that the outstanding concerns can be addressed in the next few weeks / months . Please note that we can only offer a maximum of 5 EV figures at the moment . Additional extra figures will need to be included in an Appendix file . Please see our guide to authors for more information . Please also add a scale bar to figure EV1c . REFEREE REPORTS Referee # 1 : The authors have submitted a revised manuscript where they have addressed the critiques of the reviewers . Major concerns were related to the specificity of the antibodies used to detect Abeta42 by imaging , the co - IP data , additional controls to distinguish lysosomal degradation and the confrontation with Miyagawa et al ( 2016 ) . The new version is indeed improved and the authors have satisfactorily many of the raised issues by including new controls and performing some additional experiments . There are however some remaining issues related to my major critiques that needs some more scrutiny . With respect to the specificity of the Abeta42 antibodies , the first answer is not to the point : it is not because there are 246 papers using these antibodies that paper 247 is OK . The authors make the wrong conclusion that what is published is per definition correct : how many of these 246 papers provided proper controls for antibody specificity ? There are a zillion antibodies actively used in the AD field directed against any risk factor or APP fragment . I can assure the authors that a dramatic high number of antibodies to for instance g - secretase subunits , APP , ADAM10 basically fail when checked in the respective KO backgrounds . Nevertheless , there are even more papers published using such antibodies . With respect to the two anti - Abeta42 antibodies , the authors support their claim for specificity by using g - secretase and bace1 inhibitors and providing data ( via their collaborator ) in APP KO neurons . The authors have to admit that the latter are not 100 % conclusive or supportive . I can maybe live with the specificity of the 12F4 antibody as the APP KO shows little background . But the H31L21 shows on the contrary still ( very ) high backgrounds particularly in the cell body but as well in the dendrites : It is for me very difficult to distinguish major differences between the staining in the wt vs APP KO dendrites . In a way this is reflected in the quantifications using DAPT ( but also Compount IV ) where 24 to 48hrs inhibition only gives a moderate drop ( 30 % to 50 % for H31L21 and even less ( 25 % to35 % ) for 12F4 ) in Abeta42 : in such a time span these inhibitors should give drops up to 80 % . So , to my opinion this is largely caused by the inherent high backgrounds these antibodies generate in ICC applications ( similar analysis by ELISA on N2A would prove / disprove my case ) . The authors didn ' t make a stronger case by providing the APP KO EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 17 and DAPT data . However , I cannot deduce from the data and figures which experiments were done with the 12F4 or H31L21 antibody . With respect to the co - IP data , the authors maintain them in the manuscript with only a minor change on interpretation ( from ' interaction ' to ' suggestive for interaction ' ) . Again , the authors make the wrong argumentation that this might boost interest in the search for interaction domains . My point was that if co - IP data are not scrutinized with the proper controls , they are not reliable : it doesn ' t make any sense to use them to steer the community into further interaction studies . The only control in these experiments is the inclusion of control IgG . That is not sufficient to claim ( suggestive ) interaction . There should be at least additional controls , including beads + antibody without lysate , additional control antigens that do not co - IP . For each IP the provided data have a problem . The co - IP with anti - APP antibodies shows a moderate enrichment for APP ( while one would expect a dramatic higher amount in the IP - ed fraction compared to the input ) . On the contrary , the CD2AP seems to dramatically co - enrich : the levels in the input are barely detectable in contrast to the IP lane . In almost all cases one observes the reverse ( high levels in input , low levels in the co - IP lane ) . With respect to the BACE1 - Bin1 interaction : also here the BACE1 ( co - ip antigen ) levels in the IP lane are higher than in the input lane . Moreover , the IP lane contains 3 bands : impossible that all these bands are Bace1 . . . If these co - IP blots are true , they can only be explained by a very strong interaction ( in both cases ) , which is surprising as the IP is done even in more stringent conditions ( TritonX100 extraction ) . And if these proteins interact so strongly , there should be a more evident colocalization at the immunofluorescence level : by stating that they see an increased ' overlap ' the authors admit there is not much true colocalization . In fact , no single APP hot spot coincides with CD2AP immunoreactivity in dendrites ( figure 3H ) . the same holds true for CD2AP - Rab5 : they do not colocalize , but some organelles tend to overlap and it is the overlap the authors are measuring ( for BIN1 vs BACE1 , there is a better correlate ) . Nevertheless they use these readouts to further support interaction and localization in EE . Minor comments : - Most quantifications of imaging data are presented with individual data points combined with mean values and SEM . In these sets , the representative images correlate with the quantifications . In few cases , however , the authors use a line diagram ( e . g . 2E , EV3C ) : in both cases , the representative images do not follow the quantification ( although , if I read correctly , quantifications are similar and normalized ) . Based on the images , I would expect that the ' red line ' ( siCD2AP in 2E and Leupeptin in EV3C ) would go higher than 100 % , but it remains a straight horizontal line . Can the authors clarify this ? Also related to the EV3C : the authors show that upon leupeptin treatment 22C11 accumulates and is not degraded . However , and this was the point of the critique , they do not show whether this represents full length APP or the shedded ectodomain that is accumulating . - Related to the specificity of Bin1 recruiting BACE1 into recycling tubules : given that there are no conclusive data on the Bin1 - Bace1 interaction , it should be of added value to show that besides Bace1 also TFR is recycled in a Bin1 - dependent manner : in fact , repeat experiment 6E with internalized Tfr - 488 . Referee # 2 : The authors have addressed all the concerns raised by this referee , who now recommends publication in EMBO Reports . Referee # 3 : The authors fulfilled our requests . Regarding the comment ( 2 ) , I would suggest the reviewers to refer a paper by Buggia - Prévot , V . et al . , Mol . Neurodegener . 9 , 1 ( 2014 ) to support the assumption that the trafficking of exogenous C - terminally tagged BACE1 is similar to that of endogenous BACE1 . Cross - comments from referee 3 : Regarding these specificity issues , I agree with both concerns raised by the reviewer . However , the EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 18 accumulation of intracellular A β was not a major focus in this manuscript . If they are able to show the increase in the intracellular A β by different method ( e . g . , western blot or ELISA ) and omit fig . 1 , that should be enough . Rather , this manuscript suffers the specificity of antibodies used in IP experiment , as the reviewer 1 indicated . I would suggest the authors to check the specificity of anti - APP , CD2AP and BACE1 antibodies using lysates obtained from RNAi - treated cells . 2nd Revision - authors ' response 14 October 2016 Referee # 1 : The authors have submitted a revised manuscript where they have addressed the critiques of the reviewers . Major concerns were related to the specificity of the antibodies used to detect Abeta42 by imaging , the co - IP data , additional controls to distinguish lysosomal degradation and the confrontation with Miyagawa et al ( 2016 ) . The new version is indeed improved and the authors have satisfactorily many of the raised issues by including new controls and performing some additional experiments . There are however some remaining issues related to my major critiques that needs some more scrutiny . 1 - With respect to the two anti - Abeta42 antibodies , the authors support their claim for specificity by using g - secretase and bace1 inhibitors and providing data ( via their collaborator ) in APP KO neurons . The authors have to admit that the latter are not 100 % conclusive or supportive . I can maybe live with the specificity of the 12F4 antibody as the APP KO shows little background . Response : We thank the reviewer for agreeing that antibody anti - ab42 12F4 is specific . Importantly we would like to point out that the main result of the manuscript regarding ab42 accumulation , fig . 1c , that shows ab42 polarization by KD of Bin1 and CD2AP was performed using the antibody 12F4 that gave the cleanest result using APP KO neurons and that reviewer # 1 agreed was specific . 2 - But the H31L21 shows on the contrary still ( very ) high backgrounds particularly in the cell body but as well in the dendrites : It is for me very difficult to distinguish major differences between the staining in the wt vs APP KO dendrites . Response : We agree that H31L21 shows a higher background and some remaining labeling of dendrites of APP KO , in our experiments with wt neurons we did not observe such a high background , nevertheless , our quantifications of mean fluorescence of ab42 were always done upon background subtraction . We used H31L21 to show an increase in ab42 fluorescence in N2a cells KD for Bin1 and CD2AP ( fig . 1a ) and to show that re - expression of neuronal Bin1 and CD2AP restored ab42 levels to that of control , confirming the specificity of the increase in abeta42 observed ( EV2C ) . We propose to remove fig1a to strengthen our finding as suggested by reviewer # 1 . 3 - In a way this is reflected in the quantifications using DAPT ( but also Compount IV ) where 24 to 48hrs inhibition only gives a moderate drop ( 30 % to 50 % for H31L21 and even less ( 25 % to35 % ) for 12F4 ) in Abeta42 : in such a time span these inhibitors should give drops up to 80 % . So , to my opinion this is largely caused by the inherent high backgrounds these antibodies generate in ICC applications ( similar analysis by ELISA on N2A would prove / disprove my case ) . The authors didn ' t make a stronger case by providing the APP KO and DAPT data . However , I cannot deduce from the data and figures which experiments were done with the 12F4 or H31L21 antibody . Response : We acknowledge that there are limitations with using immunofluorescence quantifications for absolute measurements of protein amount . We agree with the reviewer that theoretically we should observe a higher effect . However we think it is important to point out that , despite the limitations of this technique , we are able to observe the expected reduction of ab42 levels after the treatment with DAPT and compound IV ( Fig EV1b ) and increase of ab42 levels upon overexpression of APP and BACE1 ( Fig . EV1a ) . Importantly , we are able to observe changes in the levels of ab42 between the axon and dendrites in a single neuron , which is not possible to achieve using other techniques . EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 19 Regarding which antibodies ( 12F4 or H31L2 ) where used in data and figures we appreciate this point from the reviewer since we missed that information in several cases . We have now added that information in the figures and figure legends and expect that it will be more clear to the readers to understand our findings . In summary , we and others ( Liao et al . , 2015 ; Miyagawa et al . , 2016 ) have shown that Bin1 and CD2AP loss of function can increase ab42 production . However , in the current manuscript we provide for the first time evidence for a polarization of the increased production of ab42 upon Bin1 and CD2AP loss of function : ab42 increases in dendrites when CD2AP is KD but in axons when Bin1 is KD . Such polarization of ab42 production can only be measured in the same cell by immunofluorescence . We think that with the controls provided as suggested by the reviewer # 1 , we demonstrate that we can measure relative changes in ab42 levels within a single neuron . 4 - With respect to the co - IP data , the authors maintain them in the manuscript with only a minor change on interpretation ( from ' interaction ' to ' suggestive for interaction ' ) . Again , the authors make the wrong argumentation that this might boost interest in the search for interaction domains . My point was that if co - IP data are not scrutinized with the proper controls , they are not reliable : it doesn ' t make any sense to use them to steer the community into further interaction studies . The only control in these experiments is the inclusion of control IgG . That is not sufficient to claim ( suggestive ) interaction . There should be at least additional controls , including beads + antibody without lysate , additional control antigens that do not co - IP . For each IP the provided data have a problem . The co - IP with anti - APP antibodies shows a moderate enrichment for APP ( while one would expect a dramatic higher amount in the IP - ed fraction compared to the input ) . On the contrary , the CD2AP seems to dramatically co - enrich : the levels in the input are barely detectable in contrast to the IP lane . In almost all cases one observes the reverse ( high levels in input , low levels in the co - IP lane ) . With respect to the BACE1 - Bin1 interaction : also here the BACE1 ( co - ip antigen ) levels in the IP lane are higher than in the input lane . Moreover , the IP lane contains 3 bands : impossible that all these bands are Bace1 . . . If these co - IP blots are true , they can only be explained by a very strong interaction ( in both cases ) , which is surprising as the IP is done even in more stringent conditions ( TritonX100 extraction ) . And if these proteins interact so strongly , there should be a more evident colocalization at the immunofluorescence level : by stating that they see an increased ' overlap ' the authors admit there is not much true colocalization . In fact , no single APP hot spot coincides with CD2AP immunoreactivity in dendrites ( figure 3H ) . the same holds true for CD2AP - Rab5 : they do not colocalize , but some organelles tend to overlap and it is the overlap the authors are measuring ( for BIN1 vs BACE1 , there is a better correlate ) . Nevertheless they use these readouts to further support interaction and localization in EE . Response : With respect to the co - ip data we now understand the reviewer concerns and agree to remove it from the paper as it was suggested by reviewer 1 point 2 in the first revision . Minor comments : - Most quantifications of imaging data are presented with individual data points combined with mean values and SEM . In these sets , the representative images correlate with the quantifications . In few cases , however , the authors use a line diagram ( e . g . 2E , EV3C ) : in both cases , the representative images do not follow the quantification ( although , if I read correctly , quantifications are similar and normalized ) . Based on the images , I would expect that the ' red line ' ( siCD2AP in 2E and Leupeptin in EV3C ) would go higher than 100 % , but it remains a straight horizontal line . Can the authors clarify this ? Response : I understand the reviewer expectation when looking at the images the 22C11 signal upon the 60 min chase appears brighter . This is due to the concentration of the signal in a smaller area that sums up and result in the brighter spots observed upon 60min in siCD2AP in 2E and Leupeptin in EV3C . So to our eyes , the representative image of 60 min chase looks brighter than 10 min pulse . However , when we quantify the total fluorescence of the cell , 60 min chase has the same or lower fluorescence than upon 10 min pulse . By other words , our quantification of the intensity is at both time points divided per the whole cell area . In the experiments shown in fig . 2E and EV3C , we performed a pulse of 22C11 that binds APP and is endocytosed , we consider the amount after this 10min pulse to be 100 % . Upon extensive washing this finite amount of 22C11 bound to APP traffics until the lysosome and part of it gets degraded resulting in a decrease of the initial amount of 22C11 EMBO reports - Peer Review Process File - EMBO - 2016 - 42738 © European Molecular Biology Organization 20 pulsed . In absence of degradation , the end point should have an amount of 22C11 equal to the initial one , which is close to 100 % . Therefore , in these pulse - chase experiments , it is not expected to observe values above 100 % . Indeed both upon CD2AP KD and leupeptin treatment we observed that the level of 22C11 was close to 100 % . Also related to the EV3C : the authors show that upon leupeptin treatment 22C11 accumulates and is not degraded . However , and this was the point of the critique , they do not show whether this represents full length APP or the shedded ectodomain that is accumulating . Response : We agree with the reviewer that the pulse - chase with 22C11 does not exclude a contribution of the shedded domain of APP to the build up of 22C11 . To circumvent this we analysed APP full length levels upon leupeptin treatment by western blot with anti - APP C - terminal domain ( APP Y188 ) in fig . EV3D . We observed an increase in APP full length levels upon leupeptin inhibition of the lysosome suggesting that in the pulse chase experiments , 22C11 build - up includes full length APP . - Related to the specificity of Bin1 recruiting BACE1 into recycling tubules : given that there are no conclusive data on the Bin1 - Bace1 interaction , it should be of added value to show that besides Bace1 also TFR is recycled in a Bin1 - dependent manner : in fact , repeat experiment 6E with internalized Tfr - 488 . Response : We appreciate that the suggestion of the reviewer will show that TfR recycles with BACE1 . However , transferrin receptor recycling has been shown upon Bin1 KD ( Pant , 2009 ) , Transferrin receptor recycling occurs only in the somatodendritic domain and not in axons ( West , AE ; 1997 ) where we found BACE1 recycling to be dependent on Bin1 , moreover Miyagawa 2016 recently showed evidence for a direct interaction between Bin1 and BACE1 . Thus although this experiment would confirm the results described in these publications , at least for N2a cells , would not provide further mechanistic evidence for the findings presented in the current manuscript . So we would propose not to perform these experiments . Referee # 2 : The authors have addressed all the concerns raised by this referee , who now recommends publication in EMBO Reports . Referee # 3 : The authors fulfilled our requests . Regarding the comment ( 2 ) , I would suggest the reviewers to refer a paper by Buggia - Prévot , V . et al . , Mol . Neurodegener . 9 , 1 ( 2014 ) to support the assumption that the trafficking of exogenous C - terminally tagged BACE1 is similar to that of endogenous BACE1 . Response : We have now added the suggested ref in line 134 of the results section . 3rd Editorial Decision 19 October 2016 I am very pleased to accept your manuscript for publication in the next available issue of EMBO reports .
