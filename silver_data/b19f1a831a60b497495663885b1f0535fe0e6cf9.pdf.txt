In this paper , we present CELL - E , a text - to - image transformer architecture that generates a 2D probability density map of protein distribution within cells . Given a amino acid sequence and a reference image for cell or nucleus morphology , CELL - E offers a more direct representation of protein localization , as opposed to previous in silico methods that rely on pre - defined , discrete class annotations of protein localization to subcellular compartments . Keywords : text - to - image synthesis , transformers , single - cell imaging , generative models 1 1 Introduction In recent years , advancements in sequencing technologies have allowed for the com - prehensive cataloging of proteins and their amino acid sequences across a wide range of organisms [ 1 ] . Despite this progress , the exact functions and cellular dynamics of many proteins remain unclear . In order to gain a deeper understanding of these pro - teins , researchers have sought ways to predict their properties , including structure , interactions , subcellular localization , and trafficking patterns , from their amino acid sequences . This type of computational analysis has the potential to shed light on the “dark matters” of the proteome and enable large - scale screening before expen - sive experimental validation . These tools have numerous applications in biomedical research , such as drug design and therapeutic target discovery [ 2 ] . In this study , our focus is on predicting subcellular localization of proteins from their amino acid sequences , which serves as the spatial context for their cellular func - tions . The localization of a protein to a specific subcellular compartment can be driven by either active transport or passive diffusion in conjunction with specific protein - protein interactions , often involving localization “signals” in the amino acid sequence [ 3 – 5 ] . In many cases , however , the exact mechanisms for sequence recognition and traf - ficking are not yet fully understood [ 6 ] . For example , there is ongoing debate about the mechanism behind the import of proteins via the nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) [ 7 ] . Given these challenges , machine learning utilizing existing knowledge of protein localization has become a particularly useful tool . Although computational prediction of protein subcellular localization from pri - mary amino acid sequences is an active area of research , most works train the model with class annotation of subcellular compartments ( e . g . nucleus , plasma membrane , endoplasmic reticulum , etc . ) which are available from databases such as UniProt [ 8 ] . This approach has two major limitations . First , many proteins are present in differ - ent and variable amounts across multiple subcellular compartments . Second , protein localization could be highly heterogeneous and dynamic depending on the cell type and cell state ( including cell cycle state ) . Neither of these two aspects have been captured by existing discrete class annotations . Consequently , machine - learning - based protein localization prediction still have limited applications [ 9 ] . Furthermore , to assist mechanistic discoveries , it is highly desirable for the machine learning models to be explainable . To investigate the relationship between sequence and subcellular localization , we present CELL - E , a text - to - image based transformer which predicts the probability of protein localization on a per - pixel level from a given amino acid sequence and a conditional reference image for the cell morphology and location ( Fig . 1 ) . It relies on transfer learning via amino acid encodings from a pretrained protein language model , and two quantized image encoders trained from a live - cell imaging dataset . By generating a two - dimensional probability density function ( 2D PDF ) atop the reference image , CELL - E naturally accounts for multi - compartment localization and the cell type / state information implicitly encoded by the cell morphology . We demonstrate the capability of CELL - E to predict localization of proteins , identify changes in localization from mutations , and uncover sequence features correlated with the specification of subcellular protein localization . 2 CELL - E Transformer MVCFRLFPVPGSGLVLVCLVLGAVRSYALELNLTDSENATCLYAKWQMNFTVRYETTNKTYKTVTISDHGTVTYNGSICGDDQNGPKIAVQFGPGFSWIANFTKAASTYSIDSVSFSYNTGDNTTFPDAEDKGILTVDELLAIRIPLND… Protein Sequence Nucleus Image Predicted Localization Fig . 1 Given an input of amino acids and a reference nucleus image , CELL - E makes a prediction of protein localization with respect to the nucleus as a 2D probability density function , shown as heatmap , with color indicating relative confidence for each pixel . 2 Results 2 . 1 The CELL - E Model CELL - E is inspired by the text - to - natural - image generation model of DALL - E [ 10 ] ( See Section S . 2 . 1 ) for a review of relevant work ) . Similar to DALL - E , our model autoregressively learns text and image tokens as a single stream of data . While the goal of general text - to - image models is to produce images with high perceptual strength , they do not necessarily aim for quantitative accuracy [ 10 – 12 ] . Therefore , CELL - E was designed with the following considerations : 1 . Transfer learning . Training CELL - E requires a library of cellular images and corresponding morphological reference images for a large number of proteins . For this purpose , we utilized the recently established OpenCell library [ 13 ] , which con - tains a library of 1 , 311 CRISPR - edited HEK293T human cell lines , each having one target protein fluorescently tagged and imaged by confocal microscopy with accompanying DNA staining as the reference for nuclei morphology . The high image quality and consistency makes OpenCell a good choice as the training and vali - dation dataset ( See Section S . 3 . 1 for more information ) . Still , data availability in this domain remains a large obstacle . For example , DALL - E was trained on 250 million text - images pairs [ 10 ] , whereas even the largest publicly available dataset with annotated protein images in human cells , Human Protein Atlas ( HPA ) , only contains 12 , 003 unique proteins with just 82 , 000 images [ 14 ] . We found that utiliz - ing transfer learning by incorporating a frozen embeddings from a language model pre - trained over thirty - one million protein domains from Pfam [ 15 ] as the input embedding for the amino acid text sequence . This approach reduces the number of learned paramaters , thereby alleviating the burden for CELL - E to also learn the amino acid sequence space . This allows training to be concentrated on the relation - ship between sequence and image tokens . We evaluated multiple protein language models ( see Supplementary Information and Table S . 1 ) and eventually chose the BERT - based model from Rao et . al . [ 16 ] , which we refer to as the TAPE model , for subsequent work . 2 . Morphological reference . In our initial efforts , we found that a transformer using just the amino acid tokens and image tokens is capable of generating cell - like images from the amino acid sequence alone ( Fig . S . 3 ) . However , quantifying 3 D e c o d e r E n c o d e r VQGAN D e c o d e r E n c o d e r VQGAN MSSASGLRRGHPAGGEEN… Start 16 22 22 5 … End Pad 97 175 117 73 204 … 231 231 812 574 802 612 804 … 932 1023 BERT Tokenizer Pre - trained TAPE Embedding Learned Nucleus Embedding Learned Threshold Embedding Protein Sequence Nucleus Image Protein Threshold Image Transformer 768 1001 256 255 712 16 22 22 5 … End Pad 97 175 117 73 204 … 231 231 812 574 802 612 804 … 932 1023 712 Fig . 2 Graphical depiction of CELL - E . Solid lines correspond to pre - trained components . Gray dashed lines are learned in Phase 1 and 2 ( Reference Image and Protein Threshold VQGANs ) . Black dashed lines correspond to components learned in Phase 3 . A start token is prepended to the sequence and the final protein image token is removed . The amino acid sequence embedding from the model is preserved , and embedding spaces for the image tokens are cast in the same depth and concatenated with the amino acid sequence embedding . The transformer is tasked with reproducing the original sequence of tokens ( e . g . the input sequence with start token shifted to the right one position ) . protein localization information in the generated images is challenging . Further - more , an estimation of a single snapshot of protein localization is not necessarily a quantifiable indication of global behavior . Therefore , in addition to amino acid tokens and protein image tokens , we utilize 3 separate embedding spaces that also include tokens representing the overall cell morphology from a reference image . The references image provides the model with information regarding the localization of subcellular structures and compartments . Moreover , cell morphology implicitly provides the cell type and cell state context for CELL - E predictions . 3 . Image model . Instead of the Vector Quantized Varational Autoencoder ( VQVAE ) previously used to analyze OpenCell imaging data [ 17 ] , we chose to use Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network ( VQGAN ) [ 18 ] which produces images with comparatively higher spatial frequency . To simplify the task of the protein image VQGAN , we let it predict per - pixel binary representations of protein local - ization ( i . e . a thresholded image ) . This allows us to use the marginal probabilities predicted for each image token from CELL - E to create a weighted sum on the image tokens . This latent space linear combination is then used to generate a con - tinuous 2D probability density function of protein localization , which resembles a gray - scale image ( Fig . 7 ) . We note that the same model can also be trained to output gray - scale images directly ( See Supplementary Notes S . 2 . 2 and Fig . S . 4 ) . 4 R e l a t i v e P r o b a b ili t y R e l a t i v e P r o b a b ili t y R e l a t i v e P r o b a b ili t y M i t og e n - A c t i v a t e d P r o t e i n K i n a s e 9 N u c l e o l a r G T P - b i nd i n g P r o t e i n 2 C a s p a s e - 7 OriginalImage Thresholded Image ( Ground Truth ) Predicted Threshold Image Predicted Probability Map Fig . 3 Prediction results of several types of proteins from the validation set , unseen to the model during training . The nucleus channel is depicted in grayscale , and the protein channel is shown as an overlay in red ( Fig . S . 1 for clarification ) . The thresholded image ( Column 2 ) is designated “Ground Truth” because those are the types of images exposed to the model during training . The predicted probability map is obtained from a weighted sum of potential image patches and normalized to 1 . 2 . 2 Performance Evaluation Fig . 3 and Fig . S . 2 shows the CELL - E predictions for several proteins in the validation dataset . High similarities can be seen between the predictions and the ground truth . Even though the reference images only depict the nuclei , which is a limitation of the OpenCell training data , CELL - E can reasonably paint the shape of the cell for cytoplasmic proteins . Interestingly , the case of Mitogen - Activated Protein Kinase 9 ( MAPK9 ) contains a cell in metaphase . CELL - E correctly predicts the round shape of its distribution around the mitotic chromosomes instead of the more expanded distribution for the adjacent interphase cell . This result suggests that CELL - E can indeed capture cell state information from the morphological reference images . We used several metrics to evaluate the reconstruction performance of CELL - E , summarized in Table S . 2 . Among the metrics , nucleus proportion accuracy measures how close the estimated proportion of pixel intensity within the nucleus is to the ground truth thresholded image . We believe this is the most relevant metric as it is not obscured by small spatial variations and nucleus boundaries can be obtained from the reference images . Description of other metrics and more information on the evaluation procedure can be found in Section S . 3 . 7 . Using these metrics , we performed ablations 5 Table 1 Nuclear Localization Prediction Accuracy Train Validation VQGAN 0 . 99 ± 0 . 08 0 . 99 ± 0 . 09 CELL - E 0 . 89 ± 0 . 31 0 . 72 ± 0 . 45 MuLoc 0 . 71 ± 0 . 45 0 . 79 ± 0 . 41 Subcons 0 . 43 ± 0 . 49 0 . 69 ± 0 . 46 VQGAN indicates the accuracy evaluated on the ground truth threshold image passed through the VQGAN image encoder .

S . 5 and Table S . 1 ) . While not specifically trained as a discrete localization classifier , we also performed naive comparison between CELL - E model and 1D protein localization classifiers MuLoc [ 19 ] and Subcons [ 20 ] specifically trained with annotated protein localizations . We focused on nuclear classification using a simple classification criteria on CELL - E output ( see Section S . 3 . 7 ) , and the results are summarized in Table 1 . We observed a relatively high degree of accuracy from this method compared to the task - specific mod - els . CELL - E outperformed on the training set , and it was a close second for validation set proteins despite not seeing localization annotations during training . 2 . 3 Analysis of NLS using CELL - E As a first test to show CELL - E can recognize specific , functional sequence features , we let it predict the images for Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) , which is non - native to human , as well as GFP appended with two commonly used NLS’s KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK from nucleoplasmin [ 21 ] and PAAKRVKLD from N - Myc [ 22 ] ) that drive nuclear local - ization of a protein . We also appended a randomly generated sequence as a control . A randomly chosen nuclear image from the OpenCell dataset was used as the mor - phological reference . CELL - E struggles to make any prediction with high confidence from the base GFP sequence or GFP appended with a short peptide containing a ran - dom sequence , whereas the two GFP - NLS fusions are clearly predicted to be localized within the nucleus . Therefore , CELL - E has the potential to perform computational insertion screenings for the functional sufficiency of putative localization sequence features . Next , we examined whether CELL - E can identify NLS in a protein by compu - tationally performing truncation / deletion studies . For this purpose , we chose DNA Topoisomerase I ( TOP1 ) , whose N - terminal intrinsically disordered region ( amino acid ( aa ) 1 - 199 ) is essential for its nuclear localization [ 23 ] . An experimental study gener - ated a series of deletion mutants for this region and imaged the subcellular localization in HeLa cells when fused to eGFP [ 24 ] . To computationally reproduce this study , we fed the exact sequences of the deletion mutants to CELL - E . As shown in Fig . 5 , the 6 GFP Predicted Random Sequence + GFP Nucleoplasmin NLS + GFP c− Myc NLS + GFP Fig . 4 Predicted localization of GFP and modified - GFP sequences . predictions were largely consistent with the experimental data , recapturing the inabil - ity for aa 1 - 67 to drive nuclear localization despite containing a putative NLS , as well as the sufficiency of aa 148 - 199 as an NLS . eGFP aa 1 - 199 aa 1 - 67 aa 148 - 199 aa 158 - 199 aa 148 - 187 aa 148 - 157 aa 1 - 199 , △ 148 - 157 aa 1 - 187 , △ 148 - 157 aa 69 - 146 aa 84 - 146 aa 1 - 140 aa 140 - 146 aa 125 - 146 aa 1 - 765 aa 1 - 765 , △ 148 - 157 aa 1 - 765 , △ 117 - 146 aa 1 - 765 , △ 188 - 198 aa 1 - 146 aa 117 - 146 Construct Localization eGFP Cytoplasm aa 1 - 199 Nucleus / Nucleolus aa 1 - 146 Nucleus aa 1 - 67 Cytoplasm aa 148 - 199 Nucleus / Nucleolus aa 158 - 199 Cytoplasm aa 148 - 187 Nucleus aa 148 - 157 Nucleus aa 1 - 199 , 148 - 157 Nucleus / Nucleolus aa 1 - 187 , 148 - 157 Nucleus aa 69 - 146 Nucleus aa 84 - 146 Nucleus aa 117 - 146 Nucleus aa 1 - 140 Cytoplasm aa 140 - 146 Cytoplasm aa 125 - 146 Cytoplasm aa 1 - 765 Nucleus / Nucleolus aa 1 - 765 , 148 - 157 Nucleus / Nucleolus aa 1 - 765 , 117 - 146 Nucleus / Nucleolus aa 1 - 765 , 188 - 198 Nucleus / Nucleolus Fig . 5 Predicted localization of eGFP fusions from [ 24 ] and corresponding figures from the original paper . aa 1 - 199 contains the entire N - terminus region . aa 1 - 146 only contains Motifs I and V . aa 1 - 67 only contains Motif - I . aa 148 - 199 contains Motif II , III , IV and V . Lastly , we demonstrate a more direct approach than computational insertion or deletion studies to identify putative sequence features responsible for protein local - ization . Specifically , we split the generated image patches into two groups , one with the target protein being present and the other being absent based on the average pixel intensity within the 16 × 16 image patch . Then , we calculated the difference of attention weights for each amino acid token to contribute to the two groups .

These are aa 59 - 65 ( Motif I , KKHKEKE ) , aa 150 – 156 ( Motif II , KKIKTED ) , aa 174 – 180 ( Motif III , KKPKNKD ) , and aa 192 – 198 ( Motif IV , KKKPKKE ) . Additionally , the new NLS identified in Mo et . al . [ 24 ] , Motif V ( aa 117 - 146 ) , is highlighted . highlights the amino acids with higher weights for the ”present” group . The high - lighted amino acids includes the three putative NLSs in the experimentally verified aa 148 - 199 range , as well as part of the new aa 117 - 146 NLS identified in [ 24 ] . On the other hand , the putative NLS in the experimentally invalidated aa 1 - 69 range are not activated . The attention map also suggest that aa 89 - 107 ( KIKKE ) could be another NLS in this protein . We must point out that the calculation of attention map was simply based on a protein being ”present” or ”not present” in image patches and did not specify ”nuclear localization” at all . Therefore , it should be capable to serve as a general approach to discover putative sequence features driving protein localization to a variety of subcellular compartments . 3 Discussion CELL - E’s performance seems to be currently limited by the scope of the Open - Cell dataset , which only accounts for a handful of proteins within a single cell type and imaging modality . As the OpenCell project is an active development , we expect stronger performance as data becomes available . The availability of brightfield ( e . g . 8 phase - contrast ) images as the morphological reference will also likely improve the prediction of cytoplasmic protein localization compared to using nuclei images . Fur - thermore , the utility of the model comes in terms of linking embedding spaces of dependent data . One could imagine follow up experiments where rather than images being the prediction , other signatures such as protein mass spec could be predicted . Additionally , other sources of information , such as structural embeddings could be incorporated to bolster CELL - E’s capabilities . 4 Methods We use a multi - phase training approach similar to DALL - E , but our model also uses pre - trained language - model input embeddings for the amino acid text sequences via TAPE : • Phase 1 A Vector Quantized - Generative Adversarial Network ( VQGAN ) [ 18 ] is trained to represent a single channel 256 × 256nucleus image as a grid comprised of 16 × 16 image tokens ( Fig . S . 7 ) , each of which could be one of 512 tokens . • Phase 2 A similar VQGAN is trained on images corresponding to binarized ver - sions of protein images . These tokens represent the spatial distribution ofthe protein ( Fig . S . 9 ) . • Phase 3 The VQGAN image tokens are concatenated to 1000 amino acid tokens for the autoregressive transformer which models a joint distribution over the amino acids , nucleus image , and protein threshold image tokens . 4 . 1 Model Specifics The optimization problem is modelled as maximizing the evidence lower bound ( ELBO ) [ 25 , 26 ] on a joint likelihood distribution over protein threshold images u , nucleus images x , amino acids y , and tokens z for the protein threshold image : Theorem 1 . p θ , ψ ( u , x , y , z ) = p θ ( u | x , y , z ) p ψ ( x , y , z ) This is bounded by : Theorem 2 . ln p θ , ψ ( u , x , y ) ≥ E z ∼ q ϕ ( z | u ) [ ln p θ ( u | x , y , z ) ] − KL ( q ϕ ( x , y , z | u ) , p ψ ( x , y , z ) ) where q ϕ is the distribution 16 × 16 image tokens from the VQGAN corresponding to the threshold protein image u , p θ is the distribution over protein threshold generated by the VQGAN given the image tokens , and p ψ indicates the joint distribution over the amino acid , nucleus , and protein threshold tokens within the transformer . 9 4 . 2 Nucleus Image Encoder Training both image VQGANs maximizes ELBO with respect to ϕ and θ . The VQGAN improves upon existing quantized autoencoders by introducing a learned discriminator borrowed from GAN architectures [ 18 ] . The Nucleus Image Encoder is a VQGAN which represents 256 × 256 nucleus reference images as 256 16 × 16 image patches . The VQGAN codebook size was set to n = 512 image patches . Further details can be found in Section S . 3 . 4 . 4 . 3 Protein Threshold Image Encoder The protein threshold image encoder learns a dimension reduced representation of a discrete binary PDF of per - pixel protein location , represented as an image image . We adopt a VQGAN architecture identical to the Nucleus VQGAN . The VQGAN serves to approximate the total set of binarized image patches . While in theory a discrete lookup of each pixel arrangement is possible , this would require ∼ 1 . 16 × 10 77 entries , which is computationally infeasible . Furthermore , some distributions of pixels might be so improbable that having a discrete entry would be a waste of space . Protein images are binarized with respect to a mean - threshold , via : ¯ u i , j = (cid:40) 1 , u i , j ≥ µ , 0 , u i , j < µ , ∀ pixels u ∈ image U of size i × j , where µ is the mean pixel intensity in the image ( Fig . S . 8 ) . The 16 × 16 image patches learned within the VQGAN codebook therefore corre - spond to local protein distributions . In Section 4 . 6 , we detail how a weighted sum over these binarized image patches is used to determine a final probability density map . Hyperparameters and other training details can be found in Section S . 3 . 5 . 4 . 4 Amino Acid Embedding For language transformers , it is necessary to learn both input embedding representa - tions of a text vector as well as attention weights between embeddings [ 27 ] . In practice , this creates a need for very large datasets [ 28 ] . The OpenCell dataset contains 1 , 311 proteins , while the human body is estimated to contain upwards of 80 , 000 unique pro - teins [ 29 ] . It is unlikely that such a small slice could account for the large degrees of variability found in nature . In order to overcome this obstacle , we opted for a transfer learning strategy , where fixed amino acid embeddings from a pretrained language model exposed to a much larger dataset were utilized . We found the strongest performance came from TAPE embeddings [ 16 ] . Utilizing pretrained embeddings had the two - fold benefit of giving our model a larger degree of protein sequence context , as well as reducing the number of trained model parameters , which allowed us to scale the depth of our network . 10 25 % 60 % 15 % 0 % Fig . 7 Simplified example of probability map calculation . Each circle corresponds to an image token within the quantized VQGAN embedding space . Each PDF patch ( yellow ) is obtained as a weighted sum over all protein threshold image VQGAN codebook vectors . We tried training using random initialization for amino acid embeddings ( See Section S . 2 . 3 ) , however , we noted overfitting on the validation set image reconstruc - tion and high loss on validation sequences . We also experimented with other types of protein embeddings , including UniRep [ 30 ] and ESM1 - b [ 31 ] . 4 . 5 CELL - E Transformer The transformer ( p ϕ ) utilizes an input comprised of amino acid tokens , a 256 × 256 nucleus image crop , and the 256 × 256 corresponding protein image threshold crop . In this phase , ϕ and θ are fixed , and a prior over all tokens is learned by maximizing ELBO with respect to ϕ . It is a decoder - only model [ 32 ] . The model is trained on a concatenated sequence of text tokens , nucleus image tokens , and protein threshold image tokens , in order . Within the CELL - E transformer , image token embeddings were cast into the same dimensionality as the language model embedding to in order to maintain the larger protein context information , however the embeddings corresponding to the image tokens within this dimension are learned ( See Fig . 2 ) . 4 . 6 Probability Density Maps When generating images , the model is provided with the amino acid sequence and nucleus image . The transformer autoregressively predicts the protein - threshold image . In order to select a token , the model outputs logits which contain probability values corresponding to the codebook identity of the next token . The image patch v i is selected by filtering for the top 25 % of tokens and applying top - k sampling with gumbel noise [ 33 ] . Ordinarily , the final image is generated by converting the predicted codebook indices of the protein threshold image to the VQGANs decoder . However , to gen - erate the probability density map ¯ v , we include the full range of probability values corresponding to image patches , p ( v i ) , obtained from the output logits . The values are clipped between 0 and 1 and multiplied by the embedding weights within the VQGAN’s decoder , w i : 11 Theorem 3 . ¯ v = w · p ( v ) = n (cid:88) i = 1 w i p ( v i ) This output is normalized and displayed as a heatmap ( Fig . 7 ) . 5 Data and Code availability Our model is a heavily modified version of an open source text - to - image transformer [ 34 ] , available via the MIT license ( Copyright ( c ) 2021 Phil Wang ) .

Appendix S . 2 Supplementary Notes S . 2 . 1 Related work Natural language processing ( NLP ) has found applications in amino acid sequence encoding , due to the long contextual dependencies of amino acids in a protein’s folded three - dimensional structure [ 35 ] . Self - supervised models from the NLP field have demonstrated excellent performance in predicting protein properties from amino acid sequence inputs [ 31 , 36 – 38 ] . These models are trained on millions of amino acid sequences from databases such as BFD [ 39 ] , UniRef [ 40 ] , Pfam [ 15 ] , and Protein Data Bank [ 41 ] . The language models have proven effective in downstream tasks like struc - ture prediction , evolutionary analysis , and protein engineering [ 16 ] , with LSTM and attention - based models achieving particularly impressive results [ 27 ] . UniRep is an 14 LSTM model that predicts the next amino acid in a variable length sequence [ 42 ] , while BERT uses bidirectional masked language modeling to predict the identity of masked tokens throughout the sequence [ 43 ] . Facebook’s Evolutionary Scale Model ( ESM ) is a state - of - the - art masked - language model model , pre - trained with 250 million amino acid sequences and over 700 million parameters [ 31 ] . While traditional supervised approaches , such as stochastic modeling , have been limited by feature representation or computation time , deep learning has proven to be a powerful tool in predicting localization [ 44 ] . With the ability to optimize millions of parameters , deep neural networks have shown the ability to represent complex patterns in a manner that traditional manual feature extraction cannot [ 45 , 46 ] . The success of language models in protein prediction tasks suggests that patterns dictating these structures are buried within residue sequences [ 16 , 30 ] . Protein localization is typically framed as a class prediction task . 1D localization predictors take the primary sequence as input and produce a fixed - length vector , with each entry corresponding to a subcellular location and the values being probability values . However , these methods have limitations [ 47 , 48 ] . Discrete classifications for contiguous regions of the cell , such as the nuclear membrane , can be ambiguous and may have flawed annotations in established datasets . [ 49 ] . Additionally , these methods do not account for the influence of local cellular geometries [ 50 – 53 ] and cell states [ 54 , 55 ] on transport dynamics . For example , one would expect significantly high amounts of transcription factors for DNA replication in the S - phase of the cell cycle , but not during cell separation in mitosis [ 56 ] ) .

Unlike previous models , DALL - E utilized an autoregressive frame - work , which was trained on a joint distribution of text and image tokens , enabling it to make novel image predictions with high fidelity . In contrast , earlier models based on variational autoencoders ( VAE ) [ 25 ] or Generative Adversarial Networks ( GAN ) [ 57 ] performed poorly when generating images outside of the training data , resulting in distorted images and artifacts [ 58 – 60 ] . While our method does similarly allow for truly zero - shot protein image prediction ( Fig . S . 3 ) , our goal for image generation extends beyond visual fidelity and includes a degree of spatial accuracy . This is crucial for capturing the dynamic process of protein abundance in cells , which fluctuates with respect to cell state and environmental fac - tors . To overcome this challenge , the model is tasked with predicting per - pixel binary probability representations of protein localization , which can then be linearly combined to generate a continuous 2D probability density function of protein localization . The following images ( Fig . S . 3 , Fig . S . 4 ) are from text - to - image models architec - turally similar to CELL - E , but replace the Protein Threshold VQGAN with a similarly trained Protein Image VQGAN . Fig . S . 4 shows model outputs model similar to Fig . S . 3 above , but does include image synthesis conditioned on a nucleus image input ( via Nucleus Image VQGAN ) . The predicted outputs are perceptually more similar to the ground truth protein 15 Predicted Output 1 Predicted Output 2 Predicted Output 3 GroundTruth Input Predicted Output 1 Predicted Output 2 Predicted Output 3 GroundTruth Input Predicted Output 1 Predicted Output 2 Predicted Output 3 GroundTruth Input P r o t e a s o m e s ubun i t b e t a t y p e - 1 B r a i n - s p e c i fi c a n g i og e n e s i s i nh i b i t o r 1 - a ss o c i a t e d p r o t e i n 2 - li k e p r o t e i n 1 B E T 1 - li k e p r o t e i n Sequence to Protein Image Transformer MLSSTAMYSAPGRDLGMEPHRAAGPLQLRFSPYVNGGTILAIAGEDFAIVADTRLS EGFSIHTRDSPKCYKLTDKTVIGCSGFHGDCLTLTKIIEARLKMYKHSNNKAMTTGAIAAMLSTILYSRRFFPYYVYNIIGGLDEEGKGAVYSFDPVGSYQRDSFKAGGSASAMLQPLLDNQVGFKNMQNVEHVPLSLDRAMRLVKD . . .

The sequence ( left column ) is used as input . The middle 3 columns show separate predicted images from random initialization . The true protein image is shown in the right column . image , but the questions of accuracy and scientific utility mentioned previously continue to be a factor within this paradigm . The sequence - to - image transformer is similar to CELL - E and does not take a nucleus image as input . This produces perceptually similar images ( Fig . S . 3 ) . Within the training data , the corresponding protein image is merely a snapshot in time and could be markedly different if taken at another time point . For this reason , we do not believe a image prediction without confidence provides scientific utility . S . 2 . 3 Ablation Study Model Architecture In order to gauge the importance of each component of the model , we performed ablation by training several versions of the model with the same initialization . We specifically chose to look at performance in nuclear proportion accuracy over the validation set ( Fig . S . 5 ) . On the top row , performance from the VQGAN is used as a reference of possible top performance , just as in Table S . 2 . The second row depicts our main CELL - E ( with depth = 32 and a fixed language embedding ) used for this study . We found the performance in both cross - entropy and nuclear proportion accuracy increased with model depth when compared to similar models of smaller depth ( third , fourth , and fifth rows ) . 16 T r a i n S e q u e n ce M o d e l E m b e dd i n g F i x e d S e q u e n ce E p o c h s N u c l e u s P r e d i c t e d T h r e s h o l d P r e d i c t e d 2 D P D F SS I M I S F I D N u c l e u s L o c a li z a t i o n E m b e dd i n g M o d e l D e p t h D i m e n s i o n E m b e dd i n g ?

S . 4 CELL - E model with Protein Threshold VQGAN replaced with Protein Image VQGAN . To understand the effect of using fixed language models , we trained 2 versions of CELL - E of same depth . The first ( second row , light blue ) had a fixed language embedding , while the second ( seventh row , red ) was free to change during training . We also introduced a model with a randomly initialized language embedding ( sixth row , light green ) . While we note fairly high performance from the unfixed models on the training data , they performed quite poorly on the validation , indicating severe overfitting . This is a result of the comparatively small number of proteins represented within the OpenCell dataset when compared to the large pFam database used to train TAPE . We also trained a versions of the model which did not use a nucleus input ( second to last row , pink ) like DALL - E , and a model that only used a nucleus input and no sequence ( last row , purple ) , although a start token was still prepended . Overall , we observe a distributional shift to the right , indicating more accurate predictions , as the depth of the transformer is scaled . Full results for both training and validation sets can be seen in Table S . 1 . We also evaluated the performance of CELL - E using different protein embedding spaces . These were configured such that they were either at the same depth as the TAPE model , or the depth was scaled as deep as possible such that the GPU memory was saturated during training . All model were trained until convergence on the validation set . Language Embedding Alongside language embeddings , we also used one - hot and amino acid chemical descriptors as embedding features . The amino acid chemical 18 Protein Threshold VQGAN Transformer Depth = 32 Fixed Embedding Transformer Depth = 26 Fixed Embedding Transformer Depth = 20 Fixed Embedding Transformer Depth = 15 Fixed Embedding Transformer Depth = 26 Unfixed ( Random Init . ) Embedding Transformer Depth = 26 Unfixed ( BERT ) Embedding Transformer Depth = 32 No Nucleus Transformer Depth = 32 No Sequence M o d e l Nucleus Proportion Accuracy Fig .

[ 61 ] , which contains amino numerical descriptions of amino acid properties from various literature sources [ 62 – 71 ] . Using one - hot and amino acid descriptors allowed us to scale to deeper model depths , but we did not see much improvement from doing so using these embeddings . These encodings likely do not contain sufficient information complexity about local environments that TAPE , UniRep , and ESM1b contain . While we do not see a consistent top performer on the training data , TAPE - based models generally performed the best across all metrics on the validation set , indicating a higher degree of generalizability . 19 Appendix S . 3 Supplementary Methods S . 3 . 1 Dataset Each protein entry in OpenCell is accompanied by multiple high - resolution 3D confo - cal images containing multiple cells [ 13 ] . Having multiple live cells enables the potential for protein distribution to be captured at several time points within a cell’s lifetime . To reduce computational cost for out demonstration , we converted a 3D z - stack into a 2D maximum intensity projection [ 72 ] , which still clearly depicts most subcellular struc - tures and allow subtle subcellular protein localization differences to be distinguished from the OpenCell images [ 13 ] . The OpenCell dataset was selected because the split - fluorescent protein fusion system allows for tagging endogenous genomic proteins , maintaining local genomic context , and the preservation of native expression regulation [ 13 ] . This last point is specifically important when compared to the previously mentioned HPA , which con - tains ∼ 10 × more proteins and images . ICC - IF , which is the technique used for obtaining HPA images , requires several rounds of fixation and washing [ 73 ] . This means the proteins are not observed in a live cell , are subject to signal loss , arti - facts , and / or relocalization events , and therefore does not represent the true nature of protein expression and distribution within a cell [ 74 ] . Training and validation sets were generated by randomly splitting the OpenCell dataset by protein 80 % - 20 % training - validation For every stage of training , models were blind to sequences , nuclei , and protein images contained within the validation set . We utilize data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal and vertical flips on images during training . S . 3 . 2 Train - Validation Split Sequence Diversity In machine learning applications which utilize amino acid sequence , it is recommended to cluster proteins based on similarity in order to create a distributional shift between a training and validation ( and / or test ) set . Oftentimes , redundancy in subsequences between both sets may results in memorization of training sequences and inflated performance metrics [ 75 ] . To investigate the effect of this on CELL - E , we performed a clustered split using a procedure identical to the one used by [ 76 ] to create , a standard dataset used in benchmarking protein localization prediction . This model relies on PSI - CD - HIT [ 77 ] . In short , we clustered proteins based on a value cutoff of a designated percentage of identity for which the alignment must cover 80 % of shorter sequences . We retrained CELL - E with train / validation splits with clustered with varied threshold percentages of sequence identity , ranging from 15 % to 95 % for 130 epochs . Our random split used for the main CELL - E effectively represents clustering based on 100 % identity . We did not observe any patterns in cross - entropy loss during training of the main transformer model in response to different cutoff values for sequence identity . 20 Fig . S . 6 S . 3 . 3 Training We utilized 4 × NVIDIA RTX 3090 TURBO 24G GPUs for this study . 2 GPUs were utilized for training VQGANS via distributed training . Only a single GPU is ever used to train CELL - E models . Our computer also contained 2 × Intel Xeon Silver and 8 × 32768 mb 2933MHz DR × 4 Registered ECC DDR4 RAM . S . 3 . 4 Nucleus Image Encoder VQGAN code was obtained from Esser et . al . [ 18 ] , which was available via MIT license ( Copyright ( c ) 2020 Patrick Esser and Robin Rombach and Bj¨orn Ommer ) . The model was trained on random 256 × 256 crops of 512 × 512 nuclei images . Adam Optimizer was used with learning rate set to 4 . 5 × 10 − 6 . The model was initially trained solely using mean - squared error reconstruction loss . After 50 , 000 steps , ∼ 7 epochs , the discriminator loss term was introduced .

Unless otherwise stated , all results in this work utilized the IUPAC tokens and TAPE language embeddings . CELL - E uses encodings from TAPE , There are 30 possible codebook values for amino acids within this model , with 25 corresponding to amino acids and 5 corresponding to special tokens ( i . e . padding ) . amino acid sequence length was limited to 1000 amino acids , which is longer than 96 % of sequences within the dataset . For amino acid sequences shorter than 1000 amino acids , an end token ( if utilized by the language model ) was appended , followed by padding tokens . For amino acid sequences longer than 1000 amino acids , we randomly cropped a 1000 length 22 Protein Image Thresholded Image Thresholding Process Fig . S . 8 Example of thresholding process to convert protein image ( left ) to thresholded ground truth image ( right ) for CELL - E model subsection . If the right end of the crop ended before the true end of the amino acid sequence , no end token was applied . A start token is then prepended to all 1000 length sequence . The TAPE model used represents input embeddings as vectors with dimension n × 768 , where n is the number of amino acids . The sequence embedding for the TAPE based models therefore had embedding vector sizes of 1001 × 768 . Input amino acids were tokenized and their embeddings were retrieved from the language models . This input embedding is fixed . We also explored other embeddings ( UniRep , ESM1b , One - hot encoding , and chemical descriptors ) in Table S . 1 . CELL - E was trained with an Adam optimizer with learning rate set to 3 × 10 − 4 . The images were passed through the encoders of their respective VQGANs to obtain codebook tokens , and the final protein threshold image token is removed . We utilized data augmentation techniques including random cropping and random flips , just as was performed when training the VQGAN models . Within the CELL - E transformer , image token embeddings were cast into the same dimensionality as the language model embedding to in order to maintain the larger protein context informa - tion , however the embeddings corresponding to the image tokens within this dimension are learned . This ultimately creates a full sequence embeddings 1512 × 768 ( 1001 × 768 for text , 256 × 768 for nucleus images and 255 × 768 for protein threshold images ) ( Fig . 2 ) . A rotary positional embedding [ 78 ] is then applied to the input embeddings . We noted improved performance by shifting embeddings over by 1 ( time - shifting [ 79 ] ) in the feature dimension , but only for image tokens . Image token embeddings were shifted one position from the top and one position from the left . A full attention scheme [ 80 ] is used where future tokens are masked in order to retain full sequence and image context . The output of the attention layers is passed through a block consisting of a linear and softmax layer to produce logits for predicted 23 Fig . S . 9 512 image patches extracted from the protein threshold VQGAN tokens at each position . Selective masking is applied so the model is unable to select anything but amino acid tokens for amino acid positions , nucleus image tokens for the nucleus image positions , and protein image tokens for the protein image positions . Cross - entropy loss is used to measure the model’s ability to reconstruct the origi - nal input vector ( without the prepended start token and including the removed final protein threshold image token ) . The cross entropy is initially scaled by the length of the input , but further weighting is placed to emphasize the output protein image threshold tokens . We used weightings of 1 9 for the amino acid tokens , 19 for nucleus image tokens , and 89 for the protein threshold image tokens . 24 Table S . 2 Image Accuracy Train Validation CELL - E VQGAN CELL - E VQGAN Nucleus Proportion Accuracy 0 . 94 ± 0 . 05 0 . 99 ± 0 . 01 0 . 81 ± 0 . 18 0 . 99 ± 0 . 01 Predicted Threshold Pixel Accuracy 0 . 77 ± 0 . 06 0 . 87 ± 0 . 08 0 . 77 ± 0 . 05 0 . 88 ± 0 . 08 Predicted 2D PDF Pixel Accuracy 0 . 68 ± 0 . 10 0 . 63 ± 0 . 10 Structual Similarity Index Measure 0 . 32 ± 0 . 21 0 . 55 ± 0 . 25 0 . 25 ± 0 . 16 0 . 56 ± 0 . 25 Inception Score 2 . 77 ± 0 . 07 4 . 17 ± 0 . 17 2 . 13 ± 0 . 07 3 . 87 ± 0 . 17 Fr´echet Inception Distance 107 15 156 23 Performance is reported as mean ± standard deviation where applicable . The VQGAN columns indicate the value of these metrics evaluated on the ground truth threshold image passed through the protein threshold VQGAN . As CELL - E selects tokens from this VQGAN to produce its outputs , these values represent the best possible performance for our model . The main CELL - E model had a depth of 32 , indicating 32 consecutive attention and feed forward blocks , and 16 attention heads with dimension = 64 . We used atten - tion and feed forward attention dropout both = . 1 during training . The language embedding was fixed . Model convergence occurred at 130 epochs and these weights were used for study . S . 3 . 7 Performance Evaluation To assess performance , we generated a single prediction per image found in the Open - Cell set . Each image was randomly cropped and flipped similar to training , but cropped regions and flips were maintained between models . Nucleus Proportion Accuracy To calculate the proportion of intensity in the nucleus , we first create a mask ( Fig . S . 10 of the nucleus channel using Cellpose [ 81 ] . We take a sum over the predicted 2D PDF pixels found within the nucleus mask , and divide this by the sum of pixels across the image . Fig . S . 10 Masking procedure depicted . For the the ground truth , we use a similar masking calculation , but consider the values of the ground truth protein image . These values are subtracted to calculate 25 a mean - average error ( MAE ) . Since the maximum possible value is 1 and minimum possible value is 0 , we report accuracy as 1 - MAE . Predicted Threshold Pixel Accuracy We simple calculate a pixel - wise MAE between the predicted protein threshold image of CELL - E and the ground truth protein threshold image . Predicted 2D PDF Pixel Accuracy This metric is similar to Predicted Threshold Pixel Accuracy , except we evaluate the difference using the predicted 2D PDF , rather than the predicted protein threshold image . We expect this number to be less accurate as tokens with less confidence will reduce the pixel value , while all values in the protein threshold image are 0 or 1 . SSIM Structural similarity index measure ( SSIM ) is a measure of local perceptual similarity between images . It considers neighboring pixels to evaluate loss contextually by incor - porating luminance and contrast information . SSIM values range between 0 , indicating no similarity , and 1 , indicating maximum similarity . IS Inception score ( IS ) is often used to evaluate the image outputs of GANs as a measure of “realisticness . ” It rewards image variety and similarity to real - life data . Performance evaluation is based on the magnitude of the IS score . FID Fr´echet Inception Distance ( FID ) is another popular metric for evaluating the quality of images from generative models . It compares the distributions between generated and ground truth images as the squared Wasserstein metric between two multidimensional Gaussian distributions . For this study FID was scored against the training or validation sets when applicable , rather than the entire OpenCell dataset . Nuclear Localization Prediction The ground truth label for nuclear localization was designated by masking the nucleus , but computing the proportion of intensity on the ground truth thresholded protein image . If > 50 % of this intensity was contained within the area of the nuclear mask , the assigned label would be positive for nuclear localization . Otherwise , the protein would be designated as non - nuclear . For the predicted label , we took a summation over the masked and unmasked regions of the predicted 2D PDF . If > 50 % of pixel intensity for the 2D PDF was found in the nucleus , it was classified as a nuclear localizing protein . The protein localization prediction models were provided the amino acid sequence and were considered to predict nuclear if present in the localization prediction . These predictions were also compared against our na¨ıve labels . 26 S . 3 . 8 Visualizing Attention To obtain Fig . 6 , we first split the 16x16 generated threshold image patches into 2 groups , one where protein is primarily determined to be present ¯ u i , j > . 75 and another where background tokens are primarily selected ¯ u i , j < . 25 . For each respective group , we calculate a median of the attention matrices and used attention rollout [ 82 ] to recursively multiply across 32 layers . The final layers of both groups are then compared . We initially look at tokens with higher weightings for the present protein group , and discard the rest . We show the entire image generation process , with frames corresponding to time - steps , in the attached video file : DNAtopoisomerase1 . mp4 .
