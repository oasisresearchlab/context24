V . , part of Springer Nature 2018 Abstract Metastatic cells exhibit an extraordinary phenotypic plasticity , not only in adapting to unfamiliar microenvironments but also in surviving aggressive treatments and immune responses . A major source of phenotypic variability is alternative splicing ( AS ) of the pre - messenger RNA . This process is catalyzed by one of the most complex pieces of cellular molecular regula - tory events , the spliceosome , which is composed of ribonucleoproteins and polypeptides termed spliceosome factors . With strong evidence indicating that AS affects nearly all genes encoded by the human genome , aberrant AS programs have a significant impact on cancer cell development and progression . In this review , we present insights about the genomic and epigenomic factors affecting AS , summarize the most recent findings linking aberrant AS to metastatic progression , and highlight potential prognostic and therapeutic applications . Keywords Cancer metastasis · Alternative splicing · Epigenetics · Prognostic · Therapeutics Introduction Metastatic tumor cells have an intrinsic phenotypic plastic - ity conveyed by genetic and epigenetic alterations allowing them to adapt to and survive variable regional and systemic impediments imposed by the immune system , therapeu - tic treatments , and unfamiliar micro - environments , inde - pendent of the tumor origin [ 1 , 2 ] . Alternative pre - mRNA splicing ( AS ) is one of the major sources of protein vari - ability in human cells [ 3 ] . During the splicing process , specific non - coding sequences of precursor messenger RNAs ( pre - mRNA ) are recognized and removed to form a mature mRNA [ 3 ] . Thus , this finely regulated process generates multiple mRNA transcripts and protein isoforms with related , distinct , or even opposing functions from a single gene unit [ 3 ] . The AS process is regulated by a com - plex molecular machine deemed the spliceosome , which is composed of nuclear ribonucleoproteins and polypeptides denominated spliceosome factors ( SFs ) . Since AS controls almost all human genes , subtle alterations in this process have a significant impact on human diseases , such as the generation of tumor - promoting and metastasis - specific splice variants in cancer [ 4 , 5 ] . From a holistic perspective , variations in the expression level of SFs leads to hyper - var - iability in the individual cell - type specific splicing program . This often becomes even more pronounced in tumor cells that have a higher adaptation potential and dynamic phe - notype compared to their normal origin . The activation of AS programs of genes in a cancer cell can create aggressive tumor clones that allow them to survive and metastasize more efficiently . Nonetheless , one of the most promising aspects of spliceosome alterations is that there are at least two major levels at which aberrant splicing can be modu - lated ; first is the design of splicing site - specific antisense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) that target abnormal exons in pre - spliced mRNA . This approach has demonstrated extraordi - nary results in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) [ 6 ] and in patients with spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) [ 7 ] . The second level of splicing modulation has been translated into a new generation of antitumor drugs Presented at the 7th International Cancer Metastasis Symposium in San Francisco , CA from April 20 – 22 , 2017 ( www . cance rmeta stasi s . org ) . * Dave S .

Molecular mechanisms of pre‑mRNA splicing Mechanistically , pre - mRNA splicing occurs in a coordinated multi - step cascade of molecular events catalyzed by small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNPs ) and further regulated by the presence of more than 200 auxiliary and splicing fac - tors . The first step involves the recognition of consensus sequences called “ splice sites ” in the intron – exon boundaries of the nascent pre - mRNA . Most commonly , the fragment to be removed ( intron ) begins with a guanine - uracil ( GU ) - rich sequence at its 5 ′ end ( known as the “ donor site ” ) and ends with an adenine - guanine ( AG ) - rich sequence at its 3 ′ end ( known as the “ acceptor site ” ) [ 9 ] . To facilitate pre - mRNA splicing , these two sites are separated by a region enriched in cytosine and uracil ( C and U ) residues and a branching point , which includes an adenine nucleotide ( A ; Fig . 1a ) . The pre - mRNA splicing is orchestrated by the spli - ceosome and auxiliary factors , which recognize and bind the conserved sequences . Initially , U1 snRNP binds the splice donor site , and U2 snRNP binds the branch site ( Fig . 1b ) . Then , U4 , U6 , and U5 snRNPs bind the pre - mRNA tran - script , forming the catalytic mature spliceosome complex ( Fig . 1c ) . Next , the donor site is cut and connected to the branch site , which creates a lariat structure ( Fig . 1d ) . Finally , the U1 and U4 snRNPs are released and the donor site is cleaved to allow the exonic sequences to be attached to each other ( Fig . 1e ) . Alternative pre‑mRNA splicing and protein variability The expected outcome of the finely regulated splicing pro - gram is the exclusion of all the intronic regions and the retention of all the exonic regions of a gene unit ( Fig . 2a ) . However , through alternative splicing ( AS ) , more than 95 % of human multi - exonic genes present variations in the combinations of retained exonic regions , leading to a large variability of the human proteome ( Fig . 2b ) . High - through - put transcriptome analyses have revealed the existence of multiple AS patterns including : “ alternative first exon ” , “ alternative last exon ” , “ exon skipping ” , “ intron retention ” , “ mutually exclusive exons ” , and “ alternative 5 ′ splice site ” , and “ alternative 3 ′ splice site ” ( Fig . 2c ) . Interestingly , these alternative transcript variants are usually observed in a cell type - specific manner , which defines specific cellular and tis - sue functions and changes under specific cellular conditions . Thus , dysregulation of this mechanism provides tumor cells the means to adapt and evade different microenvironmental obstacles . Metastasis‑associated alternative splicing alterations The conservation of splice site sequences is critical to maintaining a fine - tuned splicing program . Therefore , the presence of single nucleotide variations or insertions and deletions ( indels ) on these regions can result in splicing abnormalities with potential pathological consequences . The identification of these AS alterations can lead to enhance - ment of tumor clone metastatic efficiency . Impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms on the alternative splicing program Recent advances in next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) tech - nologies have allowed the understanding of AS splicing at a high resolution .

Thus , as recently demonstrated by the genotype - tissue expression ( GTEx ) consortium , genetic variants controlling AS events , named splicing quantitative trait loci ( sQTLs ) , are spread throughout the human genome and are beginning to pique the attention of researchers for their potential cumulative impact on cancer - state specific splicing programs . Genetic alterations in splicing machinery Recurrent mutations commonly observed in cancer often have functional effects on the splicing machinery , primarily leading to alterations in the spliceosome and auxiliary fac - tors SF3B1 , U2AF1 and SRSF2 as previously reviewed [ 11 , 12 ] . Discovery of these common mutations highlighted the importance of splicing in carcinogenesis . Of the many aber - rantly expressed splicing regulators in cancer , SF3B1 ( Splic - ing Factor 3B Subunit 1A ) is the most frequently mutated [ 12 ] . It was recently demonstrated that SF3B1 mutations in various cancer types result in the selection of hundreds of cryptic 3 ′ splice sites [ 13 , 14 ] , which were found to be frequently used by four genes with known roles in cancer ( TT1I , MAP3K7 , FXYD5 , and PFDN5 ) [ 13 ] . Serine and arginine - rich splicing factor 2 ( SRSF2 ) is a well - studied SR protein with recurrent mutations in cancer [ 15 ] . Evidence continues to show that changes in the splicing program as a result of both SRSF2 and U2AF1 ( U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 ) mutations play a role in disease pathogen - esis of myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) [ 16 – 18 ] , leuke - mia [ 19 , 20 ] , and non - small cell lung cancer [ 21 ] . Epigenetic alterations of spliceosome factors in cancer progression to metastasis Alterations in the tumor cell splicing program are not only the result of genomic mutations , but variable levels of SF expression and the combinatorial activity of different splic - ing and auxiliary factors as well , thereby furthering tumor cell adaptations . These dynamic transcriptional changes are mainly influenced by epigenetic mechanisms involving DNA methylation and histone post - translational modifications [ 22 – 24 ] . As we and others have shown , one of the most sig - nificant effects of epigenetic regulation on the splicing pro - gram is the regulation of SF gene expression by both DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in the genomic vicinity of transcription start sites [ 25 , 26 ] . However , the role of epigenetics in regulating the splicing program goes beyond the control of SF gene promoter regions . For exam - ple , intragenic DNA methylation is enriched in alternatively retained exons [ 27 ] . This mechanism is driven by the recruit - ment of Methyl - CpG Binding Protein 2 ( MeCP2 ) to highly methylated genomic segments , which promotes the recog - nition of alternative exonic regions . Additionally , distinct regional histone modification signatures lead to the retention Fig . 2 Splicing mechanisms affecting multi - exonic human genes . a The expected outcome of pre - mRNA splicing mecha - nism . b Alternative splicing leading to mRNA variability in the human proteome . c Mecha - nisms leading to alternative splicing program C v1 v2 Alternativefirst exon 1a 1b 2 1a 2 1b 2 Alternativelast exon 1 2a 2b 1 2b 1 2a Exonskipping 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3 2 1 3 1 3 2 1 3 2 v1 v2 v1 v2 v1 v2 v1 v2 Mutually exclusive exons 2 4 1 3 2 4 1 3 v1 v2 Alternative5’ splice site 1a 1b 2 1b 2 1a 2 v1 v2 Alternative3’ splice site 1 2a 2b 1 2b 1 2a Intron retention A B Gene Splicing Alternative Splicing Predicted mRNA Pre - mRNA Observed mRNA 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 Splicing variant 1 1 5 6 Splicing variant 2 1 2 3 4 Splicing variant 3 1 3 4 6 2 3 4 1 5 6 2 5 1 3 4 6 5 6 1 2 3 4 Auxiliaryfactors Spliceosomefactors ( SFs ) U1 U2 U4 SF1 SF1 SF1 396 Clinical & Experimental Metastasis ( 2018 ) 35 : 393 – 402 1 3 and / or skipping of exonic as well as intronic segments by modulating the recruitment of SFs via chromatin - binding proteins [ 24 ] . For example , the H3K9me3 epigenetic repres - sive mark promotes the binding of heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) , which impacts AS by decreasing the processivity of RNA polymerase II and favors the recruitment of the core SFs [ 28 ] . Alternative splicing contributes to oncogenic processes Aberrant splicing patterns contribute to transformation and hallmarks of cancer initiation and metastasis such as unlimited proliferation , evasion of growth suppressing sig - nals , dysregulated metabolic processes , and cellular pheno - type , and cellular phenotypes , as previously reviewed [ 15 , 29 – 31 ] . For instance , the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a key player in cell proliferation and motility . A recent study observed that expression of an EGFR variant with an exon 4 deletion ( de4 EGFR ) posi - tively correlated with the progression of ovarian cancer to metastatic disease [ 32 ] . Oncogenic splice isoforms of the tumor suppressor p53 leading to a loss of function , even in the absence of TP53 gene mutations have been studied extensively [ 33 ] . Indeed , increased transcript levels of the Δ40p53 isoform was found to be significantly associated with poor outcome of patients with triple - negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) [ 34 ] . Furthermore , polypyrimidine tract binding protein ( PTBP1 ) has a complex role in tumorigen - esis in various cancers [ 35 – 38 ] . We demonstrated that , dur - ing cutaneous melanoma progression to brain metastasis , PTBP1 expression promotes a switch on the AS program that enhances survival and proliferation of melanoma cells in brain tissue [ 26 ] . Recent work has demonstrated that PTBP1 is able to promote breast cancer tumorigenesis in different microenvironments in part by repressing PKM1 ( pyruvate kinase ) expression via alternative splicing , thereby upregulating expression of the PKM2 isoform and , therefore , promoting aerobic glycolysis and tumor development [ 36 ] . Alternative splicing contributes to invasion and metastasis AS significantly influences the formation of metastases by contributing to multiple steps of the metastatic cascade ( reviewed in [ 30 , 39 , 40 ] ) . Current studies suggest that AS in both tumor development and progression is controlled by master regulators , including SRSF1 ( serine and arginine - rich splicing factor 1 ) and ESRP1 / 2 ( epithelial splicing regula - tory proteins 1 and 2 ) [ 41 – 44 ] . It has been well established that SRSF1 can enhance invasion and motility of cancer cells by shifting expression of the tyrosine kinase RON to its constitutively active isoform , ΔRON [ 45 ] . In addition , SRSF1 has been shown to modulate splicing of the kinase S6K1 , leading to the production of a short oncogenic iso - form [ 46 ] , which was recently demonstrated to function as an oncoprotein in breast cancer by upregulating the anti - apoptotic MCL - 1 [ 47 ] . ESRP1 appears to play a dynamic role in tumor development and metastasis [ 12 , 48 ] . We dem - onstrated that ESRP1 expression is epigenetically regulated in cutaneous melanoma progression to brain metastasis and that this is a key SF for the generation of melanoma clones with higher adaptation potential to normal brain tissue [ 26 ] . In addition , ESRP1 expression contributes to a poor prog - nosis in breast [ 49 ] and ovarian cancer [ 50 ] patients and is involved in lung metastasis for breast cancer patients [ 49 ] . By controlling CD44 isoform switching , specifically , to form variants with the inclusion of the exon variant 6 ( CD44v6 ) , ESRP1 enhances cell migration and invasion in melanoma brain metastases and other types of cancer [ 26 , 49 , 50 ] . Organ‑specific metastatic alternative splicing programs One of the most interesting features of the abnormal AS re - programming in cancer is the program specific - ity based on the site of organ metastasis . Consequently , alterations in the splicing programs can significantly dif - fer between synchronous metastatic lesions . In this con - text , we found that splicing alterations contributing to the generation of CD44v6 isoforms are important for brain metastases , but not for regional lymph node or extra - cra - nial distant metastases [ 26 ] . By exploring data from can - cer specimens evaluated by multi - omic platforms in the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) project , it is now possible to compare splicing alterations involved in different organ metastases [ 51 ] . For example , using the SpliceSeq algo - rithm [ 52 ] , we identified the most differentially spliced genes in metastatic melanomas ( Fig . 3a ) . Interestingly , while the expression level of the top five differentially spliced genes showed low variability among different organ metastases ( Fig . 3b ) , the analysis of the splicing isoforms expression revealed organ - specific signatures ( Fig . 3c ) . For instance , we identified that catenin delta 1 ( CTNND1 ) uc001nlv . 3 isoform shows significantly ( P value < 0 . 01 ) higher expression in melanoma metasta - ses to the small bowel than in melanoma lung or brain metastases . Contrastingly , fibroblast growth factor recep - tor 2 ( FGFR2 ) uc010qtq . 1 isoform shows significantly ( P value < 0 . 01 ) higher expression in melanoma brain metas - tases than in lung or small bowel melanoma metastases ( Fig . 3d ) . Interestingly , our epigenomic profiling of mul - tiple melanoma specimens involved in primary or lymph node melanoma progression to distant organ metastases ( n = 133 ) revealed differential DNA methylation signa - tures of key SF genes ( Fig . 4a ) . A group of these genes 397 Clinical & Experimental Metastasis ( 2018 ) 35 : 393 – 402 1 3 showed significantly different DNA methylation levels when comparing primary and metastatic melanomas ( Wil - coxon test , FDR - corrected P value < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 4b ) . Our epigenetic analysis of distant organ metastases suggests the presence of organ - specific DNA methylation changes that can explain the variations in the expression of organ - specific splicing isoforms . In agreement with our previ - ous report [ 26 ] , this analysis indicates that ESRP1 and ESRP2 genes are hypermethylated in melanoma brain and small bowel metastases . A similar trend was observed for the RNA Binding Motif Protein 20 ( RBM20 ) gene , a recently characterized AS repressor [ 53 ] ( Fig . 4c ) . Therapeutic strategies targeting alternative splicing Changes in the normal splicing program are rampant in various cancers . Identification of these cancer - specific variations , however , has revealed an array of promising therapeutic targets . The diverse nature of these changes suggests that a variety of strategies can be utilized to target aberrant splicing programs in cancer . Here we highlight key advances in the development of therapeutics directed at oncogenic AS . Small molecule inhibitors for spliceosome factors Small molecule inhibitors of mutated or aberrantly expressed splicing factors are among the first and best - stud - ied approaches to AS - based therapeutics . For example , sev - eral bacteria - derived compounds have been used to target the splicing factor SF3B1 , which is frequently mutated in several types of cancer [ 54 – 58 ] . Most notably , E7107 , spliceostatin A ( SSA ) , and herboxiedene , a secondary metabolite derived from Streptomyces chromofuscus , all serve as effective inhibitors of SF3B1 [ 59 – 61 ] . These compounds bind to the SF3B complex and disrupt its interactions with pre - mRNA ( reviewed in [ 15 ] ) . Other prevalent small molecule inhibitors have targeted RNA - binding protein kinases , which primarily act on SR proteins , serine ( S ) and arginine ( R ) - rich proteins that regulate splicing by binding exonic splicing enhancer ( ESE ) elements [ 62 ] . Members of the serine - arginine pro - tein kinases ( SRPKs ) and CDC - like kinases ( CLKs ) families have been implicated in several types of cancer [ 63 ] . These kinases phosphorylate arginine and serine - rich domains ( RS domains ) of SR proteins , thus controlling their inter - actions with regulatory elements of pre - mRNAs [ 64 , 65 ] . Small molecules such as CPD - 1 , 2 and 3 inhibit CLK activ - ity , effectively preventing phosphorylation of SR proteins , 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 TMEM14BZNF691 SYTL2ATG4DTMUB2PLA2G6PRDM2INO80CEXOC7NSRP1AIMP2PIGQMELKZNF419ST7LPACRGLDMKNINO80EFANCITNCCTNND1 CTNND1 FGFR2 FGFR2 CD44 CD44 TMEM45A TMEM45A ADAM15 ADAM15 z - sc o r e - 1 . 5 1 . 5 0 Proportion of Exon Skipping Events TCGA RNA - seq ( Gene Level ) TCGA RNA - seq ( Isoform Level ) Lung Metastases Small Bowel Mets Brain Metastases A B C z - sc o r e - 1 . 5 1 . 5 0 D FGFR2 / uc010qtq . 1 CTNND1 / uc001nlv . 3 R P K M 0 50 100 150 200 * * 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 * * Fig . 3 Differentially spliced genes in metastatic melanoma . a Exon skipping analysis using the SpliceSeq algorithm . b Hierarchical clustering ( HCL ) analysis for the gene expression level of the top five most differentially spliced genes ( ADAM15 , TMEM45A , CD44 , FGFR2 , and CTNND1 ) in metastatic melanoma . c HCL analysis for the expression level of potential splicing isoforms generated from the top five most differentially spliced genes in metastatic melanoma . d Boxplots depicting the expression level ( in reads per kilobase mil - lion ; RPKM ) of two significantly ( * * Wilcoxon test , P value < 0 . 01 ) differentially expressed genes isoforms in different melanoma organ metastases 398 Clinical & Experimental Metastasis ( 2018 ) 35 : 393 – 402 1 3 and impacting splicing patterns of genes involved in growth and survival signaling [ 66 ] . A recent study showed that inhibition of SRPK1 ( which phosphorylates SRSF1 ) by the compound SRPIN340 significantly reduces tumor growth in metastatic melanoma in vivo via reduced expression of pro - angiogenic VEGF isoforms [ 67 ] ( Fig . 5a ) . Although numerous compounds which can successfully inhibit RNA - binding protein kinases have been identified , further research is needed to confirm the mechanism ( s ) by which these pro - teins regulate specific transcripts in order to enhance drug efficacy [ 68 ] . Antisense oligonucleotides for splicing site sequences Antisense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) comprise a develop - ing but promising category of AS - based cancer therapies . Typically , these short , target specific oligonucleotides modulate splicing by hybridizing to the splice site , splicing enhancer or silencer elements of the nascent pre - mRNA , as previously reviewed [ 69 ] . Recent work has demonstrated that this approach can be used to target oncogenic AS events in various types of cancer . For example , an increase in the expression the pro - apoptotic isoform STAT3β was achieved in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models , lead - ing to a reduction in tumor growth [ 70 ] . ASOs have also successfully targeted AS in melanoma in vitro and in vivo models : ASO treatment induced exon 6 skipping in the p53 inhibitor MDM4 , resulting in decreased proliferation , as well as increasing sensitivity to MAPK - targeting therapies [ 71 ] . The specificity of ASOs makes them an attractive therapeutic option [ 69 ] ( Fig . 5b ) . However , efficient deliv - ery to tumor cells in vivo has remained a major obstacle in the application of ASOs to cancer treatment [ 72 , 73 ] . ESRP2 M B M S .

Indeed , recent stud - ies in osteosarcoma have utilized CRISPR - Cas9 to success - fully knockdown CDK11 [ 77 ] and PD - L1 [ 78 ] , resulting in decreased cell growth and increased drug sensitivity , respec - tively . Of note , CRISPR - Cas9 has been used extensively in the generation of novel cancer models to assess potential therapeutic targets , as recently reviewed [ 79 , 80 ] . An inno - vative CRISPR - Cas9 - based knock - in system was used to explore the functional significance of mutations in SF3B1 and resulting in AS events in cancer cell lines [ 81 ] . Interest - ingly , these findings indicated that the viability of SF3B1 - mutant cells was dependent on remaining wild - type alleles , bringing into question the effectiveness of pan - SF3B1 inhib - itors [ 81 ] . Although the use of CRISPR - Cas9 for targeting oncogenic AS events is not yet well studied , the specificity of such events to various cancer types combined with the ease of customization of the CRISPR - Cas9 system would suggest that splice variants can be effectively targeted with CRISPR - Cas9 . Successful CRISPR - Cas9 - guided genome editing involves the delivery of Cas9 nuclease complexed with a synthetic guide RNA ( sgRNA ) into each cell . There - fore , as mentioned for ASOs , application of CRISPR - Cas9 for AS correction significantly depends on the efficiency of the ribonucleoprotein complexes . Importantly , this system offers a dual possibility by targeting abnormal genomic seg - ments ( intronic and / or exonic regions ) and removal or modu - lation of key SFs ( Fig . 5c ) , as we recently demonstrated for PTBP1 expression in a TNBC in vitro model [ 82 ] . These new discoveries and approaches may greatly contribute to the development of novel therapeutics in the near future . Clinical trials for alternative splicing‑targeting therapies The expanding repertoire of AS - based therapeutic targets has culminated in numerous clinical trials . E7107 was the first spliceosome inhibitor to be tested in phase 1 clinical trials . This first - in - class drug was proved in solid tumors pre - senting dose - dependent reversible inhibition of the spliceo - some machinery . Unfortunately , minimal clinical responses , perhaps due to uncommon spliceosome mutations in solid tumors , and ocular toxicities have slowed further clinical development of this drug [ 83 , 84 ] . More recently , H3B - 8800 , an orally available SF3B complex modulator , has shown preferential activity in spliceosome mutant epithe - lial and hematologic tumor cells compared to normal cells [ 85 ] . It is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial in hematological neoplasms patients with spliceosome mutations ( Table 1 ) . ASO agents have been more widely developed . Currently , there are ASO agents approved by the FDA for the treatment of non - neoplastic diseases ( for exam - ple , eteplirsen for DMD and nusinersen for SMA ) . However , the use of ASOs in cancer therapy is still under evaluation . Oblimersen , an ASO that targets BCL2 , has shown mod - est clinical benefits in multiple phase 3 clinical trials in patients with melanoma [ 86 ] , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) [ 87 ] and multiple myeloma [ 88 ] , not achieving FDA Fig . 5 Potential therapeutic strategies targeting aberrant alternative splicing . a Small molecule inhibitors , such as E7107 , SSA , SRPIN340 , H3B - 8800 , and herboxiedenes to decrease the effects of mutant and aberrantly expressed spli - ceosome factors . b Antisense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) specifically designed to block the binding of key splicing and auxiliary factors to the nascent pre - mRNA molecule and thus , avoid the formation of the core spliceosome in abnormally spliced genomic regions . c CRISPR - Cas9 ribonucleopro - tein ( sgRNA + Cas9 nuclease ) bound to the vicinity of abnor - mal genomic segments 400 Clinical & Experimental Metastasis ( 2018 ) 35 : 393 – 402 1 3 approval . Custirsen , another oligonucleotide that targets the anti - apoptotic chaperone clusterin , demonstrated a signifi - cant increase in overall survival when combined with doc - etaxel in a phase 2 trial in advanced prostate cancer patients [ 89 ] . However , this benefit was not confirmed in two recent phase 3 trials in patients with metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer [ 90 , 91 ] . Oligonucleotide - based therapies are being actively studied in ongoing clinical trials in different cancer types as single agents , or in combination with other systemic therapies ( Table 1 ) . Perspectives Unraveling the complexity of the spliceosome and charac - terizing cancer - specific splicing alterations , remains a chal - lenge for future research in oncology . Additional insight into the splicing programs , however , may elucidate valuable cancer - specific therapeutic targets and biomarkers . Techno - logical improvements in molecular profiling allow for a bet - ter understanding of the role of AS in cancer progression to metastasis , and positions the field for new approaches in the development of therapeutic modulation of AS in can - cer patients . Personalized and precision medicine for the treatment of cancer can be greatly advanced by the identi - fication of such specific biomarkers , guiding the therapeu - tic program based on the unique molecular profile of the tumor . In addition , to further advance basic and translational AS research , additional clinical studies are much needed to address potential predictive biomarkers for treatment response and improving patient outcomes .
