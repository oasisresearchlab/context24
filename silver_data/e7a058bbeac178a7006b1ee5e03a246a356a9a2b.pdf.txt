Cognitive neuroscience studies of analogy have demonstrated the importance of the prefrontal cortex during relational comparisons , but little is known about how semantic and relational similarity interact throughout its time course . We used scalp electroencephalography ( EEG ) analyzed with event - related potentials ( ERPs ) to examine the neural time course of analogical reasoning while 16 participants solved four - term verbal analogies . Semantic similarity was manipulated by increasing the se - mantic distance between source and target analogs creating semantically near and far analogies . Relational similarity was manipulated by creating relationally valid and invalid analogies . Only valid analogies were im - pacted by semantic distance such that far analogies were solved slower and less accurately than near analogies . Correctly solving near analogies elicited more positive waveforms at the N400 and during later relational processing . However , valid analogies elicited more positive signals during only later relational processing and not during the N400 . These results suggest that semantic information impacts both early semantic and late relational comparison stages , while relational properties exert more in ﬂ uence in later stages of analogical rea - soning . The degree of semantic similarity shared between knowledge domains demonstrated a potent e ﬀ ect throughout the time course of analogy that a ﬀ ected not only semantic access , but also the mapping of relational structures . 1 . Introduction Analogical reasoning is a core component of analytic intelligence ( Snow , Kyllonen , & Marshalek , 1984 ; Spearman , 1927 ; Sternberg , 1977 ) and of great importance in learning and discovery in both chil - dren ( e . g . , Gentner , 2016 ; Goswami , 1992 ; Richland , Zur , & Holyoak , 2007 ) and adults ( e . g . , Dunbar & Klahr , 2012 ; Spellman & Shauer , 2012 ) . Central to analogical thinking is the process of relational com - parison between two domains of information usually labeled as source and target . For instance , in order to verify a four - term ( A : B : : C : D ) verbal analogy problem such as animal : zoo : : person : house , the reasoner needs to compare the relation connecting animal : zoo ( i . e . , lives in ) in the source , to the relation connecting person : house in the target . Under - standing factors that in ﬂ uence the time course of this relational com - parison process and their supporting neural substrates will inform how we perform analogy , as well as other relationally - based processes ( e . g . , decision making ) , in our complex , dynamic , and semantically rich environment . Patient - based ( Andrews et al . , 2013 ; Krawczyk et al . , 2008 ; Krawczyk , Hanten et al . , 2010 ; Morrison et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2012 ; Urbanski et al . , 2016 ) and functional magnetic resonance ima - ging ( fMRI ) studies ( e . g . , Bazargani , Hillebrandt , Christo ﬀ , & Dumontheil , 2014 ; Bunge , Helskog , & Wendelken , 2009 ; Bunge , Wendelken , Badre , & Wagner , 2005 ; Cho et al . , 2010 ; Christo ﬀ et al . , 2001 ; Green , Kraemer , Fugelsang , Gray , & Dunbar , 2010 ; Krawczyk , McClelland , Donovan , Tillman , & Maguire , 2010 ; Kroger et al . , 2002 ; Volle , Gilbert , Benoit , & Burgess , 2010 ; Watson & Chatterjee , 2012 ) have begun to identify a network of brain areas associated with ana - logical reasoning . In a recent meta - analysis of fMRI studies , Hobeika , Diard - Detoeuf , Garcin , Levy , and Volle ( 2016 ) demonstrated the con - sistent recruitment of bilateral frontal - parietal brain regions during di ﬀ erent analogical reasoning tasks . Semantic analogy tasks activated the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex ( rlPFC ) and inferior and middle frontal gyri , while visuospatial matrix tasks additionally activated https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . bandc . 2018 . 11 . 012 Received 11 July 2018 ; Received in revised form 21 November 2018 ; Accepted 27 November 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author .

Voxel - based morphometry ( Aichelburg et al . , 2016 ) and symptom lesion mapping ( Urbanski et al . , 2016 ) techniques ad - ditionally demonstrated that decreased analogy performance was as - sociated with increased grey matter volume and severity of lesions in the left rlPFC , respectively . Together , these various MRI - related tech - niques have demonstrated that the left rlPFC is a critical cortical region involved during relational comparison in analogy . In particular to semantic analogies , the anterior regions of the PFC have been linked to processing relationally complex and creative ana - logies ( Bunge et al . , 2005 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2017 ; Green , 2016 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , & Dunbar , 2008 ; Green , Kraemer , Fugelsang , Gray , & Dunbar , 2012 ) . For instance , verbal analogies where the source and target words are semantically distant ( e . g . , dish : cabinet : : boat : harbor ) require greater engagement of left frontopolar cortex than problems where the source and target are closer ( e . g . , dish : cabinet : : bowl : cup - board ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . Additionally , Green et al . ( 2017 ) ad - ministered focal anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) to this left frontopolar region while participants searched for source - target word pairs that produced creative valid analogies ( see Weinberger , Iyer , & Green , 2016 for task description ) . Participants that received tDCS reported analogies with increased semantic distance between source - target word pairs compared to sham participants ( i . e . , did not receive stimulation ) , further suggesting that heightened acti - vation of this area facilitates integrating relationally similar , but se - mantically distant , concepts . Given the signi ﬁ cant evidence for the role of anterior prefrontal cortex in relational processing ( e . g . , Bunge et al . , 2009 ; Dumontheil , Gilbert , Frith , & Burgess , 2010 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012 , 2017 ; Hobeika et al . , 2016 ; Volle et al . , 2010 ; Watson & Chatterjee , 2012 ) these results suggest that semantically near analogies may rely more on the retrieval of semantic associates and less on re - lational representations compared to semantically distant analogies . In addition to semantic similarity , source and target analogs can vary in relational similarity . Valid analogies occur when their source and target share the same relationship and bindings ( e . g . , dish kept in cabinet : : boat kept in harbor ) , while invalid analogies occur when these relationships are dissimilar ( e . g . , dish kept in cabinet : : bouquet made of ﬂ ower ) . Correctly rejecting invalid analogies is more di ﬃ cult , takes longer , and results in greater activation in the dorsolateral PFC and anterior left inferior PFC than identifying valid analogies ( Bunge et al . , 2005 ) . However , this process is in ﬂ uenced by the semantic similarity of source and target . Patients with frontal - variant frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ) demonstrated di ﬃ culties in ignoring semanti - cally - similar , but relationally - dissimilar ( i . e . , invalid ) , items in scene , verbal , and picture analogy tasks when compared to patients with temporal - variant FTLD ( Krawczyk et al . , 2008 ; Morrison et al . , 2004 ) . These results suggest the importance of the frontal lobe in reconciling the competition between relational and semantic information . Although several neuropsychological and fMRI studies have de - monstrated the importance of PFC regions in performing analogy , the neural time course of semantic and relational processing during analogy are still in need of investigation . Krawczyk et al . ( 2010 ) utilized fMRI to investigate temporally isolated relational encoding ( A : B ) , mapping / in - ference ( C ) , and response stages ( D ) while participants veri ﬁ ed four - term picture analogies . Compared to less relationally intensive semantic and perceptual match conditions , encoding relationships within source images was the most active phase and placed demands on several PFC regions , including the left dorsolateral PFC , left inferior and medial frontal gyrus , and medial and posterior medial PFC . Although less ac - tive overall , the analogical mapping / inference phase similarly activated the left inferior medial frontal gyrus and the response phase demon - strated no signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erences . These results are in contrast to fMRI studies of analogy that have identi ﬁ ed the rlPFC as a critical cortical region involved during inference / mapping ( e . g . , Bunge et al . , 2005 ; Cho et al . , 2010 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , Shamosh , & Dunbar , 2006 ; Green et al . , 2010 , 2012 ; Hobeika et al . , 2016 ; Volle et al . , 2010 ; Wendelken , Nakhabenko , Donohue , Carter , & Bunge , 2008 ) ; however , di ﬀ erent presentation styles of analogies ( e . g . , Krawczyk et al . , 2010 ) may shift activity from mapping / inference to relational encoding of the source . Temporally separating the presentation of source - target analogs and terms to explore the neural time course of analogy may change how these problems are solved while providing new insights into analogical reasoning . While fMRI provides excellent spatial resolution of neural activity , its ability to temporally isolate semantic and relational processing during problem solving is limited . In contrast , scalp electro - encephalography ( EEG ) o ﬀ ers excellent temporal resolution . Only two studies to date have used EEG analyzed with event - related potentials ( ERPs ) to examine the neural time course of analogy . A study by Qiu , Li , Chen , and Zhang ( 2008 ) investigated analogical comparisons of a source and target pairing of three - letter strings ( e . g . , abc : abd : : ijk : ij ? ) and found more negative - going waveforms from 400 to 1200 ms during analogical mapping when compared to a baseline task . More speci ﬁ - cally , this waveform was localized to the left prefrontal cortex late during processing ( 900 – 1200 ms ) . In a similar study , Maguire , McClelland , Donovan , Tillman , and Krawczyk ( 2012 ) analyzed ERPs following encoding , mapping , and response phases of a semantic analogy task and compared them to se - mantic and perceptual conditions that did not require relational com - parisons . During the encoding phase , participants encoded the re - lationship between source items ( A : B ) for the analogy condition , but passively viewed these items for the semantic and perceptual condi - tions . In comparison to passive evaluation , encoding relations elicited positive signals in left frontal electrodes starting 400 – 600 ms following stimulus presentation . During the mapping phase , the analogy condi - tions required participants to map the encoded relation between the source items ( A : B ) onto a presented target item ( C ) and infer a re - lationally appropriate ﬁ nal term ( D ) , while perceptual and semantic conditions required inferences of appropriate perceptual and semantic matches , respectively . Spatial - temporal di ﬀ erences were again found between the analogy and perceptual tasks , such that a left frontal electrode ( F5 ) depicted negative - going signals for the analogy condition between 300 and 600 ms , while later processing was characterized by positive signals in a right posterior site ( O2 ) between 700 and 900 ms . Di ﬀ erences were not observed during the response phase across con - ditions . Together , these results ( 1 ) suggest that relational encoding and mapping are cognitively intensive processes di ﬀ ering in timing and topography and ( 2 ) begin to address the di ﬀ erences in time course and topography during evaluations of semantic and relational information . However , neither of these studies controlled the semantic properties of source and target analogs , making it di ﬃ cult to understand how se - mantic information a ﬀ ects the time course of analogical processing . To further explore the time course of analogy , we employed Green and colleagues ' ( 2010 ) method of di ﬀ erentiating near and far analogies to develop a large set of four - term verbal analogy problems based on asymmetric relations for use with EEG . Participants were sequentially presented source ( A : B ) and target ( C : D ) analogs that di ﬀ ered in se - mantic distance and relational similarity . Similar to Maguire et al . ( 2012 ) , semantic processing during analogical mapping was evaluated using the N400 ERP . The N400 component is a negative de ﬂ ection in EEG signal that typically peaks 400 ms after the presentation of a sti - mulus and increases in negativity as a stimulus becomes more incon - gruous from its context ( Kutas & Federmeier , 2011 ) . For example , in lexical decision tasks where participants are presented with prime - target word pairs , more negative N400s are observed when target words are semantically unrelated to their primes ( e . g . , CAR - PEN ) re - lative to related primes ( e . g . , DOG - CAT ; Holcomb & Neville , 1990 ) . We hypothesized that the N400 ( 300 – 500 ms ) to the target pair would be less negative for near analogies than for far analogies regardless of the relational similarity between source and target . To evaluate the in ﬂ u - ence of semantic processing on later relational comparison , we ma - nipulated the relational similarity across source - target analogs forming M . J . Kmiecik et al . Brain and Cognition 129 ( 2019 ) 25 – 34 26 valid and invalid analogies . Although the exact ERP components for capturing relational comparison are unclear , the previous EEG studies have suggested neural di ﬀ erences late in the time course across fronto - central ( Qiu et al . , 2008 ) and parietal ( Maguire et al . , 2012 ) sites . Be - cause of our interest in the N400 as a metric of semantic processing , we measured relational processing following the N400 between 500 and 1100 ms . Consistent with the ﬁ ndings of Green et al . ( 2010 , 2012 ) , we anticipated that verifying far analogies would place greater demands on relational processing than verifying near analogies . Thus , we hy - pothesized that semantic processing from the source would in ﬂ uence early processing of the target resulting in an N400 e ﬀ ect and also in - ﬂ uence later analogical mapping resulting in electrophysiological signal di ﬀ erences across relational similarity , time , and topography . 2 . Method 2 . 1 . Participants Eighteen right - handed undergraduate students attending Loyola University Chicago participated in the experiment . All participants gave informed consent to take part in the study and received monetary compensation according to procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Declaration of Helsinki . Two participants were excluded from the analysis due to poor EEG recording quality . Thus , all behavioral and EEG analyses are based on 16 participants ( age M = 21 . 25 , SD = 1 . 18 , range = 18 – 23 years ; 3 Females ; 1 Left handed ) . 2 . 2 . Materials The construction of four - term verbal analogy problems began with the generation of a large number of highly recognizable word pair ex - emplars of asymmetric semantic relations inspired by Spellman , Holyoak , and Morrison ( 2001 ) . The relations were asymmetric such that the directionality of the relation ( e . g . , lives in ) speci ﬁ ed the roles of items within each word pair . For example , the relation lives in speci ﬁ ed that A ( bird ) lives in B ( nest ) , but never implied the opposite direction B ( nest ) lives in A ( bird ) . A total of 540 word pairs were generated for the following ﬁ ve asymmetric relations : kept in ( e . g . animal : zoo ) , kind of ( e . g . aluminum : metal ) , made of ( e . g . candle : wax ) , used to ( e . g . train : - travel ) , and works for ( e . g . curator : museum ) . Each relation type con - tained 108 word pairs . Following the methods of Green et al . ( 2010 ) we used latent semantic analysis ( LSA ; Landauer , Foltz , & Laham , 1998 ) to measure the semantic distance between word pairs . Utilizing the singular value decomposition , LSA performs computations on large corpora of text de ﬁ ned within semantic spaces to produce semantic similarity ratings between entities of text . The matrix comparison feature in LSA allows users to enter a list of terms and produce similarity ratings between all terms entered in the list . All possible word pairs were entered into LSA using the matrix comparison feature and semantic similarity ratings were acquired for all possible combinations of word pairs ( http : / / lsa . colorado . edu / ) . Semantically near and far analogy problems were constructed by sorting all possible analogies by semantic distance and selecting pairs of word pairs that had either high ( semantically similar ) or low ( semantically distant ) LSA values , respectively . The classi ﬁ ca - tion of analogies as either semantically near or far was determined not by an a priori LSA threshold , but rather by their rank in LSA estimates after sorting and visual inspection by the authors . Word pairs with identical relations were paired to form relationally similar valid ana - logies and pairs representing di ﬀ erent relations were paired to form relationally dissimilar invalid analogies . Using this method , 720 unique analogies were created for this study that did not previously originate from existing or published stimulus sets . Analogy problems were fully crossed between the factors of validity ( valid and invalid ) and semantic distance ( near and far ) creating four problem types : near - valid , near - invalid , far - valid , and far - invalid . Two counterbalanced versions of 360 unique problems were created with 90 of each problem type . The two versions were counterbalanced between - subjects , such that half of the participants received one ver - sion , while the other half received the other version . The trial order was randomized for each participant . Every target ( C : D ) word pair was used four times within each version , each time paired with a di ﬀ erent source ( A : B ) word pair to create the four types of problems ( see Table 1 ) . Di ﬀ erent C : D pairs were used across the two counterbalanced versions ; however , the same A : B pairs were used in both versions and appeared in di ﬀ erent problem types . Problem - wise ( A : B : : C : D ) semantic distance was matched across validity and inter - pair semantic distance ( A : B and C : D ) was equal across the four problem types . Likewise , the pairs in the various problem types did not di ﬀ er in mean word length or word frequency as measured using Hyperspace Analogue to Language ( HAL ; Balota et al . , 2007 ) . See Table 2 for semantic and lexical stimuli char - acteristics . Table 1 Example four - term verbal analogy problems .

Custom - designed Falk Minow caps with 64 equi - distant active electrodes ( Ag / AgCl ) were used for data collection . CMS / DRL were placed near the vertex . Two electrodes were located on the mastoid bones . Two electrodes were lateral to each eye to monitor horizontal eye movements . Two additional electrodes not located in the cap were placed on the inferior edge of the orbit of each eye to monitor vertical eye movements . Data were collected without applied ﬁ lters with a sampling rate of 512 Hz . The following EEG data processing steps were performed in EMSE ( Source Signal Imaging , San Diego CA ) . EEG data were re - referenced to the average of the two mastoid electrodes and then digitally ﬁ ltered with a 0 . 01 Hz high - pass ﬁ lter and band - stop ﬁ lter from 59 to 61 Hz . All ﬁ lters had a cuto ﬀ attenuation of 12 dB / octave . A polynomial detrend was applied to the data to implement a 200 ms pre - stimulus baseline adjustment for ERP averaging . A spatial PCA ﬁ lter ( a method available in EMSE ) was applied to remove ocular artifacts . Muscle and other artifacts including left / right eye movements were removed via visual inspection of the raw EEG signal and a ± 100 µV trial - by - trial rejection criterion during averaging . Participants who were included in ERP analyses had fewer than 15 % rejected trials on every condition . We calculated mean amplitude estimates for each participant be - tween two time windows to capture early semantic processing ( 300 – 500 ms ) and later relational processing ( 500 – 1100 ms ) following the presentation of the target word pair ( i . e . , C : D ) . The N400 provides an index of semantic processing and is traditionally measured between 300 and 500 ms ( see Kutas & Federmeier , 2011 ; Lau , Phillips , & Poeppel , 2008 ) . This early N400 time window was de ﬁ ned a priori . In contrast , the exact ERP components for capturing relational comparison are unclear . The previous EEG studies of analogy ( Maguire et al . , 2012 ; Qiu et al . , 2008 ) have suggested neural di ﬀ erences late in the time course during analogical mapping that occur post - N400 . Given our interest in the N400 as a metric of semantic processing , we measured relational processing immediately following the N400 between 500 and 1100 ms . This later time window was de ﬁ ned post hoc by taking into consideration methodological di ﬀ erences from Maguire et al . ( 2012 ) and Qiu et al . ( 2008 ) as well as reaction time estimates from our sample . Further , mean amplitude estimates from each channel were averaged within ﬁ ve global electrode positions in order to observe gross changes in topography : left - frontal , center - frontal , right - frontal , cen - tral , and parietal sites . 2 . 4 . Procedure After being prepared for the EEG recording , participants sat in a quiet room 100 cm from a 21 - inch CRT monitor . Word pairs were presented horizontally on the screen ( see Fig . 1 ) and width was adjusted to no more than 4 degrees of visual angle . The task was run and data were collected using E - Prime 2 . 0 and participants made their responses using a Psychology Software Tools electronic response box ( Scheneider , Eschman , & Zuccolotto , 2002 ) . After task instructions participants performed 20 practice trials with trial - by - trial feedback . Trial design and timing followed from the pro - cedure of Bunge et al . ( 2005 ) . Each trial began with a randomly jittered ﬁ xation cross that lasted from 500 to 1000 ms ( see Fig . 1 ) . The ﬁ rst word pair was presented at the center of the screen for 3 . 3 s . Partici - pants were instructed to think of how the pair of words was related . Following an equal sign presented for 750 ms , a second pair of words was presented for 3 . 5 s during which participants were to decide whether the two pairs of words were related in the same way as the ﬁ rst pair of words ( i . e . , formed a valid analogy ) . Participants indicated their choice by pressing one of two buttons with two ﬁ ngers from their right hand . The entire experiment consisted of 360 trials divided into twelve blocks separated by 20 s rests . ERP analyses were locked to presentation of the C : D word pair and only included correct trials . Statistical analyses were performed in R ( version 3 . 2 . 0 ) and RStudio ( version 0 . 98 . 1091 ; R Core Team , 2015 ) . Repeated - measures ANOVAs and generalized eta - squared ( η G2 ) calculations were performed using R package ez ( Bakeman , 2005 ; Lawrence , 2013 ) . Cohen ’ s d measures and their con ﬁ dence intervals were calculated using the R package e ﬀ size ( Torchiano , 2017 ) with the pooled standard deviation used as the standardizer .

Behavioral results A 2 ( near vs . far ) × 2 ( valid vs . invalid ) repeated - measures ANOVA was performed to explore the e ﬀ ect of semantic distance and relational similarity on accuracy . Participants were more accurate in solving near ( M = 87 . 8 % , SD = 4 . 52 % ) than far ( M = 84 . 9 % , SD = 4 . 00 % ) analo - gies that resulted in a signi ﬁ cant main e ﬀ ect of semantic distance , F ( 1 , 15 ) = 28 . 64 , MSE = 0 . 0005 , p < . 001 , η G2 = 0 . 04 . Relational si - milarity ( validity ) did not a ﬀ ect accuracy between valid ( M = 85 . 8 % , SD = 6 . 61 % ) and invalid ( M = 87 . 0 % , SD = 6 . 76 % ) analogies , F ( 1 , 15 ) = 0 . 2 , MSE = 0 . 01 , p = . 66 , η G2 = 0 . 01 . However , we observed an interaction , F ( 1 , 15 ) = 8 . 48 , MSE = 0 . 001 , p = . 01 , η G2 = 0 . 03 . Simple main e ﬀ ects analyses were conducted to further explore the interaction by examining the e ﬀ ect of semantic distance on valid and invalid analogies . The participants were more accurate in judging valid near ( M = 88 . 5 % , SD = 7 . 1 % ) than valid far ( M = 83 . 1 % , SD = 6 . 8 % ) analogies , t ( 15 ) = − 4 . 99 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 25 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 46 , 2 . 04 ] , while similar accuracies were observed for invalid near ( M = 87 . 2 % , SD = 7 . 2 % ) and invalid far ( M = 86 . 8 % , SD = 6 . 9 % ) analogies , t ( 15 ) = − 0 . 36 , p = . 73 , d = 0 . 09 , 95 % CI [ − 0 . 63 , 0 . 81 ] . The response times of participants ’ correct judgments were mea - sured from the onset of the C : D word pair and analyzed with the same procedure as accuracy ( see above ) . Participants correctly responded faster to near ( M = 1510 ms , SD = 200 ms ) than to far ( M = 1573 ms , SD = 196 ms ) analogies that resulted in a signi ﬁ cant main e ﬀ ect of semantic distance , F ( 1 , 15 ) = 12 . 06 , MSE = 4974 , p = . 003 , η G2 = 0 . 02 . Participants correctly responded faster when solving valid ( M = 1461 ms , SD = 196 ms ) compared to invalid ( M = 1628 ms , SD = 250 ms ) analogies that resulted in a main e ﬀ ect of relational si - milarity ( validity ) , F ( 1 , 15 ) = 9 . 68 , MSE = 45165 , p = . 007 , η G2 = 0 . 12 . We also observed an interaction between semantic distance and relational similarity F ( 1 , 15 ) = 15 . 93 , MSE = 3498 , p = . 001 , η G2 = 0 . 02 . This interaction was explored using the same simple main e ﬀ ects analysis as explained above . The participants were faster in judging valid near ( M = 1403 ms , SD = 193 ms ) than valid far ( M = 1523 ms , SD = 212 ms ) analogies , t ( 15 ) = 4 . 76 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 19 , 95 % CI [ 0 . 41 , 1 . 97 ] , while similar reaction times were ob - served for invalid near ( M = 1627 ms , SD = 260 ms ) and invalid far ( M = 1630 ms , SD = 246 ms ) analogies , t ( 15 ) = 0 . 12 , p = . 92 , d = 0 . 03 , 95 % CI [ − 0 . 70 , 0 . 75 ] . 3 . 2 . EEG results A four - way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on mean amplitudes to evaluate electrophysiological di ﬀ erences in semantic and relational processing across the time course with respect to electrode position . Signals were averaged within ﬁ ve global electrode positions in order to observe gross changes in topography ( see middle panel of Fig . 2 ) . The four within - subjects factors included validity ( valid vs . invalid ) , semantic distance ( near vs . far ) , time ( 300 – 500 ms vs . 500 – 1100 ms ) , and electrode position ( left frontal , center frontal , right frontal , central , parietal ) . The two levels of the time factor were chosen to compare early semantic processing between 300 and 500 ms , a time window traditionally used to examine the N400 ( Brown & Hagoort , 1993 ; Holcomb & Grainger , 2009 ; Kutas & Hillyard , 1980 ) , and a later 500 – 1100 ms time window suspected to be important for relational processing . The results of this four - way repeated measures ANOVA are shown in Table 3 . In examining the omnibus ANOVA , we observed a signi ﬁ cant four - way interaction ; however , this four - way interaction became a trending e ﬀ ect ( p = . 07 ) after applying a Greenhouse - Geisser correction for violating assumptions of sphericity ( Mauchly ’ s Test for Sphericity ; W = 0 . 22 , p = . 02 ) . We observed signi ﬁ cant three - way interactions with time as one of the factors : ( 1 ) validity × distance × time , ( 2 ) distance × time × position , and ( 3 ) validity × time × position . Follow - up testing was performed to further understand how the neural pro - cessing of semantic distance and relational validity during analogical reasoning di ﬀ ered across time and topographical location . Follow - up testing was not performed on the validity × distance × time interaction because it did not address the neural di ﬀ erences across both time and topography . 3 . 2 . 1 . Understanding the semantic distance × time × electrode position interaction . Follow - up testing was performed by separating signals based on their electrode position and performing ﬁ ve two - way repeated mea - sures ANOVAs , one ANOVA for each electrode position , across the factors of semantic distance and time . As can be seen in Table 4 , the only signi ﬁ cant two - way interaction between semantic distance and time was at the posterior electrode cluster . Simple main e ﬀ ects were computed to further understand this interaction by comparing near ( n = 2378 total accepted trials in ERP grand - average ) and far ( n = 2286 total accepted trials in ERP grand - average ) analogies at se - parate early ( 300 – 500 ms ) and late ( 500 – 1100 ms ) time windows for the posterior electrode cluster . As seen in Fig . 2 , the semantic distance between source and target analogs elicited an N400 e ﬀ ect with the processing of near analogies resulting in more positive amplitudes compared to far analogies ( d = 0 . 97 95 % CI [ 0 . 21 , 1 . 73 ] ) . A similar , but weaker e ﬀ ect ( d = 0 . 62 [ − 0 . 12 , 1 . 36 ] ) , was seen during later re - lational processing . Regardless of relational similarity , the degree of semantic similarity between source and target analogs a ﬀ ects proces - sing of the target analog during both early semantic processing ( 300 – 500 ms ) and later processing ( 500 – 1100 ms ) when relational comparisons are likely performed . This suggests that semantic distance impacts both semantic processing and mapping during the process of analogy . 3 . 2 . 2 . Understanding the validity × time × electrode position interaction . The same follow - up testing procedure was repeated to understand how the processing of relationally valid and invalid analogies di ﬀ ered across time and topographical locations ( see Table 5 ) . Signi ﬁ cant two - way interactions were observed in the center frontal , right frontal , central , and posterior electrode clusters , but not in the left frontal electrode cluster . Each signi ﬁ cant interaction was explored using the same procedure of computing simple main e ﬀ ects as described above , except valid and invalid analogies were the conditions of comparison at each time window and had 2335 and 2329 total accepted trials in each ERP grand - average , respectively . No N400 di ﬀ erences were observed between valid and invalid analogies at either the center frontal , right frontal , central , or posterior electrode sites . However , the processing of valid analogies elicited more positive amplitudes than invalid analogies during later relational comparisons at center frontal , right frontal , central , and posterior electrode sites ( see Fig . 2 ) . Regardless of semantic similarity , the degree of relational similarity between source and target analogs a ﬀ ected processing of the target analog during later relational comparison ( 500 – 1100 ms ) , but not early semantic computations ( 300 – 500 ms ) . This suggests that the relational information from source analogs does not impact the early semantic processing of target analogs . Rather , relational information is late - acting ( i . e . , post - N400 ) and greatly impacts the process of analogical mapping between source and target analogs . 4 . Discussion This investigation explored the neural time course of verbal analo - gical reasoning while participants processed target word pairs that varied in both semantic distance and relational similarity relative to their source . We hypothesized that the semantic processing of the source would in ﬂ uence early semantic processing of the target resulting in an N400 e ﬀ ect . We also predicted that semantic distance between the M . J . Kmiecik et al . Brain and Cognition 129 ( 2019 ) 25 – 34 29 source and target would bias the extent of later relational processing resulting in electrophysiological signal di ﬀ erences across relational si - milarity , time , and topography . Our results strongly support this ﬁ rst hypothesis , but only tentatively support the second due to a trend ( p = . 07 ) towards a four - way interaction between validity , semantic distance , time , and topographical location . Two signi ﬁ cant three - way interactions from this omnibus ANOVA were explored to evaluate our ﬁ rst hypothesis ( i . e . , semantic distance × time × electrode position interaction ) and how the processing of relational similarity changed across time and electrode position ( i . e . , validity × time × electrode position ) . Together , these analyses explored the extent to which se - mantic distance and relational similarity between source - target word pairs a ﬀ ected the neural processing of analogies across topographical space and time . 4 . 1 . Semantic processing The semantic information encoded from source analogs in ﬂ uenced both early ( 300 – 500 ms ) and late ( 500 – 1100 ms ) processing of target analogs across posterior electrodes . An N400 e ﬀ ect was observed with semantically near targets eliciting more positive signals compared to semantically distant targets . This evidence suggests that the semantic information extracted from source word pairs a ﬀ ected early semantic processing of target analogs . Furthermore , semantically near analogies continued to elicit more positive signals through later relational com - parison stages , suggesting that semantic information also impacts later relational processing stages of analogy . These ERP e ﬀ ects are potentially explained by two cognitive me - chanisms : fast automatic priming through automatic spreading of ac - tivation ( ASA ; Collins & Loftus , 1975 ) and more controlled / e ﬀ ortful Fig . 2 .

M . J . Kmiecik et al . Brain and Cognition 129 ( 2019 ) 25 – 34 30 prediction - based strategies ( Lau , Holcomb , & Kuperberg , 2013 ; Steinhauer , Royle , Drury , & Fromont , 2017 ) . The theory of ASA con - ceptualizes semantic representations as nodes that , when activated , quickly and automatically activate other related nodes . The subsequent processing of these related nodes is faster ( i . e . , primed ) and is thought responsible for modulating N400 amplitudes ( Deacon , Hewitt , Yang , & Nagata , 2000 ; Kiefer , 2002 ) . Recent studies have also demonstrated that N400 mean amplitudes may result from post - lexical prediction - based processes at both short ( 250 ms ; Steinhauer et al . , 2017 ) and long ( 600 ms ; Lau et al . , 2013 ) prime - target stimulus onset asynchronies ( SOAs ) , suggesting that predictability may modulate the N400 over and above ASA . In addition , post - lexical integration processes governed by prediction in working memory modulated signals following the N400 and were characterized by increasingly positive - going de ﬂ ections ( Steinhauer et al . , 2017 ) . It is likely that both mechanisms are a ﬀ ecting the neural signals from processing target word pairs . Given our highly controlled pre - sentation and equal proportion of all problem types ( dis - tance × validity ) , the participants were unable to predict either the semantic relatedness or validity of each target pair in relation to the source . Therefore , early semantic processing di ﬀ erences in the N400 were likely driven by ASA priming mechanisms . However , the long SOA between source and target presentation ( 4050 ms ) likely induced par - ticipant prediction strategies . One potential strategy is to utilize the inferred relationship between the source word pair items to facilitate predictions about the semantic content and relationships shared be - tween target word pair items ( i . e . , making it easier to ﬁ nd a valid re - lational match when looking for one ) . An absent N400 e ﬀ ect between valid and invalid analogies suggests that this prediction - based strategy did not in ﬂ uence early processing , but rather impacted later processing for near analogies . Given the long prediction inducing SOA and similar delayed positivity for later relational processing as seen in Steinhauer et al . ( 2017 ) , it is likely that post - lexical prediction based mechanisms modulated ERP signals for near and far analogies during later relational comparisons . Therefore , we speculate that prediction - based mechan - isms impacted later relational comparisons , especially for analogies that shared a high degree of semantic similarity between source and target analogs , while ASA priming mechanisms impacted early N400 signals .

M . J . Kmiecik et al . Brain and Cognition 129 ( 2019 ) 25 – 34 31 Previous fMRI investigations of analogy have implicated anterior regions of the PFC , especially the left rlPFC , as critical regions for re - lational comparisons ( see Hobeika et al . , 2016 for meta - analysis ) . Furthermore , Green et al . ( 2010 , 2012 ) have demonstrated increased activation in frontopolar cortex as the semantic distance increases be - tween source and target analogs , suggesting that comparisons of se - mantically similar analogs may rely more on their shared semantic than relational representations . Our results corroborate this hypothesis in that near source analogs primed their targets resulting in more positive N400 mean amplitudes than semantically distant ones . Additionally , this facilitated access to semantic representations a ﬀ ected later rela - tional processing ( i . e . , post N400 ) , suggesting that semantic informa - tion is a potent in ﬂ uence in analogy with lasting e ﬀ ects throughout its time course . Despite these similarities to previous MRI - related analogy studies , it is important to keep in mind the di ﬀ erences between these neuroima - ging methods . The EEG / ERP technique measures the summation of post - synaptic potentials on the scalp from billions of potentially active neurons during cognitive processing events . The neural generators of ERP e ﬀ ects ( e . g . , N400 ) have potentially several sources that travel through the various tissues of the brain often alongside other sources generated from overlapping cognitive processes . This creates the inverse problem , which is the inability to determine the neural generator ( s ) of a particular resulting scalp distribution , that limits the ability to make inferences about areas of cortex involved in cognitive processing ( Luck , 2014 ) . In contrast , the hemodynamic response used in blood - oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) contrast fMRI allows millimeter precision of anatomical metabolic activity related to cognitive processing . Given the di ﬀ erences in the spatial resolutions between fMRI and EEG , we will refrain from speculating too much in the following discussion regarding our contrasting topographical results between previously reported fMRI ﬁ ndings . When solving semantically near analogies , we observed the largest ERP di ﬀ erences in posterior and central electrode sites , while fMRI studies typically report increased activation in anterior PFC regions . These topographical di ﬀ erences are the result of the neuroimaging techniques implemented , as well as timing and experimental manip - ulations . Our parietally observed N400 e ﬀ ect between evaluating near and far analogies is consistent with previous N400 studies that often report maximal di ﬀ erences in posterior electrode sites ( see Kutas & Federmeier , 2011 ) and , importantly , was observed between 300 and 500 ms following the presentation of the target ( C : D ) analog . MRI - re - lated analogy studies typically report suprathreshold BOLD di ﬀ erences that occur throughout the time course of solving ( i . e . , several seconds ) . This di ﬀ erence in temporal resolution , as well as the aforementioned spatial di ﬀ erences , between EEG and fMRI create di ﬃ culties in com - paring topography . Furthermore , Green et al . ( 2010 , 2012 ) fMRI studies manipulating the semantic distance between source - target analogs reported the pro - cessing of only valid analogies . It is important to note that our com - parisons between near and far analogies were collapsed across validity and thus contained both valid and invalid analogies . This experimental manipulation , as well as our presentation method of separating source ( A : B ) from target ( C : D ) presentation , creates direct comparison di ﬃ - culties in respect to both timing and spatial location . However , these incompatibilities raise interesting questions regarding whether fMRI is sensitive in capturing how semantic information a ﬀ ects relational rea - soning . To explain , consider Fuster ’ s model of cortical memory that postulates functional di ﬀ erences between reciprocally connected ante - rior ( pre - central sulcus ) and posterior ( post - central sulcus ) cortical areas ( Fuster , 2003 ) . Semantic concepts in posterior association areas feedforward to anterior association areas , while reciprocal connections from anterior association cortex temporally integrate , maintain , and organize this information allowing for complex tasks such as decision making , planning , and reasoning ( Fuster & Bressler , 2015 ) . Semantic information is widely distributed across posterior cortical areas of association and may not elicit focused areas of activation detectable by fMRI . Therefore , utilizing both fMRI and EEG provides complementary information regarding how factors , such as semantic similarity , play a role throughout the time course of analogical reasoning . 4 . 2 . Relational processing The relational similarity between source and target analogs im - pacted the processing of target analogs di ﬀ erently than the e ﬀ ects of semantic distance . When collapsing across semantic distance , the neural processing of relational similarity ( valid vs . invalid ) between source and target analogs displayed no N400 di ﬀ erences , but wave - forms diverged during later relational processing with valid analogies eliciting more positive mean amplitudes than invalid analogies . The lack of di ﬀ erentiation in signals at the N400 for valid and in - valid analogies suggests that relational similarity did not facilitate early semantic processing of target analogs . In other words , this result does not provide evidence of relational priming . Relational priming is a theorized process that the relations ( e . g . , kept in ) between semantic concepts act as semantic representations . The activation of these rela - tional representations then facilitates the processing of relationally re - lated concepts . However , relational priming is sensitive to experimental design aspects such as participant instructions and stimulus presenta - tions . For example , relational priming was demonstrated with faster reaction times for lexical decision and naming latencies ( McKoon & Ratcli ﬀ , 1995 ) and more positive N400 mean amplitudes ( Lau et al . , 2013 ; Steinhauer et al . , 2017 ) when the majority of prime - target items shared the same relationship . Additionally , Maguire et al . ( 2012 ) found N300 / N400 di ﬀ erences with valid analogical targets eliciting more positive signals compared to invalid targets . In contrast , Spellman et al . ( 2001 ) demonstrated di ﬃ culties in obtaining relational priming e ﬀ ects when using analogous word pairs , but were able to obtain relational priming when participants were speci ﬁ cally instructed to utilize se - mantic relationships . Single word prime - targets are more likely to in - duce relational priming when context enables prediction . Therefore , relational priming e ﬀ ects are in ﬂ uenced by task directions and stimulus presentation . Following semantic processing , the process of relational comparison between 500 and 1100 ms elicited more positive signals for valid than invalid analogies across all topographical locations except for left frontal sites . These results suggest that one potential ERP marker of relational comparison is a late positive de ﬂ ection seen across several electrode channels across the scalp , but strongly represented in central and parietal regions . Given the aforementioned concerns regarding inferring potential cortical sites of ERP component generation ( see above Section 4 . 1 ) , we are hesitant to compare our more central and posterior topographical ﬁ ndings with previous fMRI studies of analogy that report anterior PFC regions critical for relational comparison . Compared to previous ERP and fMRI characterizations , the resulting waveforms from evaluating valid and invalid analogies are highly controlled for and collapsed across semantic distance , thus controlling for e ﬀ ects that in ﬂ uence analogical reasoning . One ERP component associated with structural processing in lan - guage is the P600 ERP . Speci ﬁ cally , the P600 component is char - acterized by increased positivity for syntactically invalid items ( Osterhout , Holcomb , & Swinney , 1994 ) and has shown sensitivity to structure mapping violations in semantic - based math problems ( Twelve forks divided by three spoons equals four ; Guthormsen et al . , 2016 ) . However , we were unable to replicate the P600 e ﬀ ect using verbal four - term analogies . In fact , relational comparisons produced the opposite e ﬀ ect ; correct identi ﬁ cations of relationally invalid target analogs ( i . e . , syntactically invalid items ) elicited more negative signals compared to valid analogies . Maguire et al . ( 2012 ) received similar e ﬀ ects with PCA factors characterizing analogical mapping as positive signals appearing across posterior sites ( 700 – 900 ms ) . Qiu et al . ( 2008 ) , however , de - monstrated increasingly negative signals during analogical mapping M . J . Kmiecik et al . Brain and Cognition 129 ( 2019 ) 25 – 34 32 compared to a baseline task . The results of previous ERP studies examining relational compar - isons and structural alignment in analogy are heterogeneous , sug - gesting that this important cognitive process is sensitive to aspects of experimental design and stimuli characteristics . Presenting analogies one term at a time ( e . g . , Maguire et al . , 2012 ; Qiu et al . , 2008 ) facil - itates the prediction of later terms and may change the cognitive pro - cess being studied from relational comparison to a ﬃ rming predictions . Importantly , our investigation demonstrates a clear di ﬀ erentiation be - tween valid and invalid relational comparisons , suggesting these con - ditions a ﬀ ect neural processing patterns and should not be averaged together in ERP assessments of analogy ( e . g . , Qiu et al . , 2008 ) . Asses - sing the neural consequences of structural misalignment at the ﬁ nal term ( e . g . , Guthormsen et al . , 2016 ) provides a clear method of nar - rowing cognitive processes to ERP components ( e . g . , P600 ) , but may underrepresent the ﬂ exibility of relational comparison across di ﬀ erent presentation styles . Thus , we speculate that our presenting the target as a word pair , as opposed to a single word as seen in P600 investigations , may have resulted in opposite neural signatures and di ﬀ erent proces - sing patterns . In addition , we are hesitant to rule out that semantic information was not in ﬂ uential on the process of relational comparison given increased positivity for semantically near analogies as well as the trending four - way interaction between validity , semantic distance , time , and topographical location . 4 . 3 . Conclusion Manipulating both the semantic distance and relational similarity between source - target analogs of verbal analogy problems resulted in behavioral and electrophysiological di ﬀ erences across time and topo - graphy . The factors of semantic distance and relational similarity in - teracted in explaining accuracy and reaction times for correct solutions . Semantically distant valid analogies were solved slower and less accu - rately than near valid analogies . Correctly identifying invalid analogies took longer than con ﬁ rming valid analogies but had comparable ac - curacies to valid near problems . The semantic distance between source - target analogs impacted target word pair evaluations during early se - mantic processing , resulting in an N400 e ﬀ ect , and later relational comparisons at parietal electrode sites . However , the relational simi - larity between source - target analogs only impacted the process of re - lational comparison and not early semantic processing . This investiga - tion suggests that the semantic information from analogical source domains has both early and late in ﬂ uence on the processing of target analogs . However , the relational similarity between source - target ana - logs a ﬀ ects the later process of relational comparison but has little in - ﬂ uence on early semantic processing . Future investigations would be well served to further deconstruct the interface between semantic and relational similarity to better understand how humans reason through the advantages and disadvantages that accompany language ability .
