Here , we use the activation of estrogen receptor - dependent enhancers in a breast cancer cell line to study enhancer - promoter communication . This allows high temporal resolution tracking of molecular events from hormone stimulation to efficient gene activation . We examine how both enhancer - promoter spatial proximity assayed by DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization , and contact frequencies resulting from chromatin in situ fragmentation and proximity ligation by Capture - C , change dynamically during enhancer - driven gene activation . These orthogonal methods produce seemingly paradoxical results : upon enhancer activation enhancer - promoter contact frequencies increase while spatial proximity decreases . We explore this apparent discrepancy using different estrogen receptor ligands and transcription inhibitors . Our data demonstrate that enhancer - promoter contact frequencies are transcription independent but are influenced by enhancer - bound protein complexes whereas altered enhancer - promoter proximity depends on transcription . Our results emphasize that the relationship between contact frequencies and physical distance in the nucleus , especially over short genomic distances , is not always a simple one . Introduction How enhancers exert their action over long genomic distances is not understood . Contemporary models range from those that involve direct enhancer - promoter contact in 3D space , models that do not require enhancer - promoter contact with each other but do require engagement with transcriptional hubs , through to models based on diffusion of activating signals in a confined volume of the nucleus ( Lim and Levine , 2021 ; Karr et al . , 2022 ) . Two major methodologies – biochemical and imaging - are most often used to study the proximity of enhancers in relation to the gene promoters they regulate . Chromosome conformation capture ( 3C ) - derived techniques rely on enzymatic fragmentation of cross - linked and detergent - treated chromatin followed by proximity ligation . When followed by next - generation sequencing , techniques such as Hi - C and micro - C can provide pair - wise contact frequencies genome - wide . 3 Hundreds of thousands , to millions , of cells are often required to obtain high - resolution interaction maps , so the resulting data represent average contact frequencies of the cell population . In imaging - based methods genomic loci are visualized either in live or fixed cells . Techniques , such as DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( DNA - FISH ) generally allow for analysis of only a handful of loci at a time in a few hundred cells but distances between loci in the nucleus can be determined at high spatial resolution at the single cell / allele level . Generally , 3C - and imaging - based approaches give concordant views of 3D genome organization ( Finn et al . , 2019 ; Mateo et al . , 2019 ; Boyle et al . , 2020 ) . However , there are examples where imaging data do not match the expectations from proximity ligation frequencies ( Williamson et al . , 2014 ; Finn et al . , 2019 ) , suggesting that the mechanistic basis for both data sets warrants further examination ( Fudenberg and Imakaev , 2017 ) . A particularly fascinating area of dynamic 3D genome organisation is enhancer - promoter interaction . Hi - C and Micro - C data both show evidence for enriched interactions between enhancers and their target promoters in vertebrate genomes ( Javierre et al . , 2016 ; Hsieh et al . , 2020 ) . These data are consistent with a looping model of enhancer - promoter direct contact ( Karr et al . , 2022 ) . However , a number of observations from imaging techniques are not consistent with a simple enhancer - promoter contact model where enhancers are juxtaposed to , or contact , their cognate target genes in a somewhat stable manner . Both live - cell imaging and DNA - FISH in fixed cells provide no evidence that very close proximity ( < 200nm ) between enhancers and promoters is temporally correlated to enhancer - driven gene transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) ( Alexander et al . , 2019 ; Benabdallah et al . , 2019 ; Platania et al . , 2023 ) . Indeed , DNA FISH indicates reduced enhancer - promoter proximity upon enhancer activation at the Shh locus ( Benabdallah et al . , 2019 ; Kane et al . , 2022 ) . Enhancers in the complex regulatory landscapes of developmental genes may have different mechanisms of action from those that function in other biological contexts , such as in the acute responses to physiological cues . Estrogen - receptor alpha ( ERα ) - dependent enhancers in the human breast cancer cell line MCF - 7 allow tracking of events after hormone treatment at high temporal resolution in a well - studied model system in which enhancers and their target genes , as well as many of the molecular mechanisms operating during enhancer activation , are well defined ( Zwart et al . , 2011 ) . Chromosome conformation capture assays including 3C , Hi - C and ER a - selected CHIA - PET have been used to examine contact frequencies in MCF - 7 cells before and after the addition of the ER a ligand 17 b - estradiol ( E2 ) ( Fullwood et al . , 2009 ; Hah et al . , 2013 ; 4 Rodriguez et al . , 2019 ) . By contrast , there has been little visual examination of the spatial proximity of specific ER a - enhancers and their target genes in the nucleus . Here we use Capture - C and DNA - FISH in MCF - 7 cells to examine the high - resolution 3D organisation of two genes whose transcription is induced rapidly and efficiently from ER a - bound enhancers upon E2 addition . We demonstrate that the two orthogonal methods produce seemingly paradoxical views of 3D enhancer - promoter organisation in response to induction and we explore the basis for these apparent discrepancies using different ligands of ERα and inhibitors of transcription . Our data demonstrate the need to carefully explore the role of enhancer - bound complexes , RNA polymerase II and transcription as determinants of 3C contact frequencies and the enhancer - promoter spatial distances determined by DNA - FISH . 5 Results Rapid enhancer - dependent gene activation in response to estradiol ERα is a member of the nuclear receptor transcription factor family ; upon binding to the ligand E2 it binds chromatin at specific pre - marked regulatory regions ( including enhancers ) within minutes ( Holding et al . , 2018 ) inducing rapid transcription of target genes ( Hah et al . , 2011 ) . Taking advantage of the extensive data available on transcription factor and co - activator chromatin binding in MCF - 7 cells stimulated with E2 , we identified two enhancer - gene pairs to study enhancer - promoter communication . GREB1 and NRIP1 are well studied E2 responsive genes ( Hah et al . , 2011 ) . E2 responsive enhancers were identified using published ERα and p300 binding data from untreated and E2 treated cells ( Hah et al . , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2013 ) , and were paired to the target genes by proximity . A putative GREB1 enhancer is located 40 kb upstream of the gene promoter and the NRIP1 enhancer is located 100 kb upstream of the promoter ( Fig . 1A ) . Using nascent RNA - seq ( TT - seq ) ( Schwalb et al . , 2016 ) , across a time course ( 5 , 30 and 60 min ) after E2 addition to MCF - 7 cells which had been extensively starved of hormone , we detect abundant transcription from these genes 30 mins after E2 addition , but not at the earlier 5 - minute time point ( Fig . 1A , B ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . As previously reported using GRO - seq ( Hah et al . , 2013 ) , TT - seq also reveals enhancer RNAs ( eRNAs ) transcribed at these ERα - bound sites and induced with similar kinetics to the gene mRNAs ( Supplemental Fig . S1A , B ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . There seems to be a unidirectional long transcript running through the intergenic space upstream of GREB1 , for NRIP1 short eRNAs are detected at the sites of ERα - binding . We confirmed these transcription dynamics at the level of individual alleles by nascent RNA - FISH using probes targeted to the first intron of each gene . There are 4 copies of GREB1 in our MCF - 7 cells - two copies on cytologically normal chromosomes 2 , one on a chromosome with additional material translocated onto 2q and the fourth on a small portion of chromosome 2p translocated onto another chromosome ( Kocanova et al . , 2010 ) . Pre - mRNA FISH detects significant upregulation of GREB1 10 min after hormone addition , with the frequency of active alleles increasing up to an hour after E2 addition when 79 % of alleles are found to be active ( Fig . 1C ; Supplemental Fig . 1C ) . NRIP1 is on chromosome 21 of which there are 2 copies in MCF - 7 cells . Significantly increased NRIP1 transcription activation is observed after 20 min of stimulation , with levels reaching a maximum at 40 mins when 73 % of alleles appear to be active ( Fig . 1C ; Supplemental Fig . 1C ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . For both genes , the number of active alleles decreases by 4h after stimulation , but not down to the level of untreated cells . chr21 : 16 , 263 , 224 - 16 , 630 , 829 100kb NRIP1 chr2 : 11 , 602 , 736 - 11 , 790 , 379 50kb GREB1 GREB1 ( TSS2 ) NRIP1 ERα + E2 - E2 + E2 5m N a sc en t RN A ( TT - s eq ) + E2 30m + E2 60m p300 - E2 p300 + E2 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 100 80 60 40 20 5 m 10 m 20 m 40 m 60 m 4 h - E2 + E2 N o foci per cell 01234 pre - mRNA - FISH GREB1 NRIP1 5 m 10 m 20 m 40 m 60 m 4 h - E2 + E2 100 80 60 40 20 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * - E2 + E2 - E2 + E2 - E2 + E2 WT NRIP1 - E2 + E2 - E2 + E2 - E2 + E2 WT GREB1 N o foci per cell 01234 A B C D % o f c e l l s 5 m 30 m 60 m - E2 + E2 * * * * * * * * T SS 1 k b ( * 10 ² ) 2 4 6 8 5 m 30 m 60 m - E2 + E2 * * * * * * * * 2 1 0 100 80 60 40 20 * * * * % o f c e ll s * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 100 80 60 40 20 * * * * * * n . s . * * * * * * * * * 0 pre - mRNA - FISH 7300 4500 4500 9500 - 95009500 - 95009500 - 95009500 - 9500 7300 4500 4500 45000 - 4500045000 - 4500045000 - 4500045000 - 45000 TT - s eq no r m a l i z ed c p m TSS2 TSS1 TSS3 Δ enh - GREB1 cl1 cl2 Δ enh - NRIP1 cl1 cl2 0 0 0 0 6 The putative GREB1 and NRIP1 ERα enhancers have other features , such as p300 and FOXA1 occupancy ( Hurtado et al . , 2010 ; Hah et al . , 2013 ) , expected of a functional enhancer , but direct genetic evidence linking these sites to the activity of target genes has been lacking . To address this , we used CRISPR - Cas9 with guides targeting the borders of the ERα peaks to delete these putative enhancers . Two clones bearing homozygous deletions for each of the two enhancer regions were recovered ( Supplemental Fig . 1D ) . GREB1 enhancer deletion led to a significant decrease in the efficiency of GREB1 activation in E2 - treated cells detected by nascent RNA - FISH ( Fig . 1D ; Supplemental Fig . 1E ) . Residual GREB1 expression may result from multiple regulatory regions coordinating GREB1 expression in E2 treated cells ( Saravanan et al . , 2020 ) . Deletion of the NRIP1 enhancer led to almost total loss of NRIP1 induction in response to E2 ( Fig . 1D ; Supplemental Fig . 1E ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . In contrast , NRIP1 was still highly E2 inducible in cells deleted for the GREB1 enhancer and GREB1 E2 - dependent induction was unaffected by deletion of the NRIP1 enhancer ( Supplemental Fig . 1E ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . These data confirm the role of the upstream ER a binding sites as bona fide enhancers driving E2 - responsive transcription specifically at at GREB1 and NRIP1 . Increased enhancer - promoter contact frequency , but decreased spatial proximity , in response to estrogen . Whether enhancers drive expression of their target promoters through a direct physical interaction , or through contact - independent mechanisms is often assayed from the interaction frequencies derived from chromosome conformation capture assays ( Leung et al . , 2022 ) . To investigate E2 - dependent enhancer - promoter communication , we performed high resolution Capture - C ( Golov et al . , 2019 ) , using tiled BACs covering a 500 kb region at GREB1 and a 1 Mb region at NRIP1 , in MCF - 7 cells treated with vehicle , or with E2 , at 5 , 30 and 60 minutes . Relative enhancer - promoter contact frequencies increase upon E2 stimulation at both loci , with enhanced focal contacts detectable between the enhancer and promoter regions ( Fig . 2A and Supplemental Fig . S2A , arrowheads ) . Using the enhancer regions as viewpoints in virtual 4C plots , increased contact frequency with the target promoter is detected as early as 5 min after E2 stimulation ( Fig . 2B and Supplemental Fig 2B , arrowheads ) and these enhancer - promoter contact frequencies are the highest in the whole captured regions ( Supplemental Fig . S2C ) . Intriguingly , and most noticeable in the case of GREB1 , transcription - related changes along the length of the gene body are also observed : while very short - range relative contact frequencies increase along the gene when it is transcribed , longer - range contact frequencies decrease ( Fig . 2A and Supplemental Fig . S2A ) . 7 Imaging - based methods such as DNA FISH and live cell imaging have questioned whether enhancer - promoter juxtaposition is required for transcription ( Benabdallah et al . , 2019 ; Alexander et al . , 2019 ; Kane et al . , 2022 ) , including for enhancer activation by nuclear hormone - dependent enhancers ( Jubb et al . , 2017 ) . To explore this in the context of rapid gene induction by ER a - dependent enhancers , we used DNA - FISH with fosmid - derived probes spanning the promoter , enhancer and control regions at the GREB1 and NRIP1 loci ( Supplemental Fig . S2C ) . We measured inter - probe distances at different time points after E2 stimulation . At both loci , enhancer - promoter inter - probe distances increase upon E2 treatment . In the case of GREB1 this is statistically significant 20 min after stimulation , but the trend is already observable at 10 min ( Fig . 2C , D ; Supplemental Fig . S2D ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . At NRIP1 , significantly increased enhancer - promoter spatial separation is observed as soon as 5 min after hormone stimulation , is sustained until 1 hour after E2 addition , but is no longer observed at 4h . Increased inter - probe distances are not seen between enhancers and control probe pairs ( Supplemental Fig . S3A ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . It is usually thought that regions showing high contact frequencies in 3C techniques fall within a 200 nm radius of each other and that , rather than looking at overall distance distributions and median values in imaging data , the proportion of loci at short distances is a more appropriate comparison ( Fudenberg and Imakaev , 2017 ; McCord et al . , 2020 ) . However , despite the increased enhancer - promoter contact frequencies we detect by Capture - C after E2 addition , cumulative frequency analysis of inter - probe distances at both the GREB1 and NRIP1 regions show that the proportion of alleles with enhancer - promoter inter - probe distances < 200 nm decreases in E2 treated cells ( Fig . 2D , right panels ) . No difference is observed in enhancer - control inter - probe cumulative distributions upon E2 addition ( Supplemental Fig . S3A ) . To ensure that any very focal enhancer - promoter co - localisation was not being obscured by our use of comparatively large ( 40kb ) fosmid - derived probes , we repeated DNA FISH with probes detecting 10 kb regions centred on the sites with E2 - triggered Capture - C higher contact frequencies . We also included a probe targeted to an intragenic ( i ) ERα ChIP peak NRIP1 locus ( Supplemental Fig . S2C ) . Twenty minutes after E2 addition , at both loci we still observe that enhancer - promoter distances increase , and the proportion of alleles at < 200nm decreases , upon E2 addition ( Supplemental Fig . S3B ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . Of note however , the absolute distances measured with the 10kb probes are smaller than those measured using the larger probe size . This may be due to to use of a confocal super - resolution imaging platform to image the 8 signals from the smaller probes , providing improved resolution , especially in the z dimension , compared to the faster epifluorescence imaging platform used for all other experiments . E2 - induced changes in enhancer - promoter contact frequency , and spatial proximity , are enhancer - dependent . To ascertain whether E2 - induced changes in chromosome conformation and spatial organisation are dependent on specific ER a enhancer activation , we performed Capture - C and DNA - FISH on the cell clones deleted for either the GREB1 or the NRIP1 enhancers that we show are required for correct E2 - dependent gene activation ( Figs . 1D and Supplemental Fig . S1 ) . The size of the engineered deletions - around 600 bp - is smaller than both the bin size used in our Capture - C analysis and the region covered by the DNA - FISH probes , making it possible to look at contact frequencies and spatial distances involving these deletion - harbouring regions . At both GREB1 and NRIP1 loci , Capture - C shows that E2 - triggered increased enhancer - promoter contact frequencies are lost upon enhancer deletion ( Fig . 2E and Supplemental Fig . S4A , B arrowheads ) . Even though E2 induced GREB1 transcription is not totally impaired by enhancer deletion , the impact of the decreased transcriptional activity on E2 dependent 3D chromatin structure within the GREB1 transcribed unit is also seen in the Capture - C heatmaps ( arrowed in Supplemental Fig . S4A ) . DNA - FISH shows that the E2 triggered increase in enhancer - promoter inter - probe distances is also lost in the enhancer - deleted cells at both studied loci ( Fig . 2F ; Supplemental Fig . S4C ; Supplemental Table S2 ) . The deletions had no impact on spatial distances measured between the enhancers and control probes ( Supplemental Fig . S4D ; Supplemental Table S2 ) . We conclude that both E2 - dependent contact frequencies , and enhancer - promoter spatial separation , are affected by the enhancer deletions but in opposite directions – a loss of enhancer - promoter contact in chromosome conformation capture assays and decreased enhancer - promoter spatial separation assayed by DNA - FISH . Enhancer - promoter contacts and spatial proximity are ligand dependent . Enhancer bound ER a recruits co - activators , including SRC1 , 2 and 3 and the histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300 , as well as the transcriptional machinery ( Zwart et al . , 2011 ; Legare and Basik , 2016 ) . Therefore , our data implicating liganded ( E2 ) ER a binding in inducing enhanced enhancer - promoter “contact” and yet decreased spatial proximity , could result from the action of ER a itself , or the recruitment of additional transcriptional activators and co - activators . Tamoxifen ( 4OH ) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator widely used to treat ER - positive breast cancer . ERα liganded with 4OH has been shown to occupy broadly the same genomic 9 sites as E2 - ERα , including the GREB1 and NRIP1 enhancers ( Fig . 3B ) ( Guan et al , 2019 ) , where it recruits co - repressors such as NCOR , including histone deacetylases , repressing the hormonal response ( Guan et al . , 2019 , Legare and Basik , 2016 ) . Taking advantage of these differences in co - factor recruitment by E2 and 4OH we assayed the impact of 4OH treatment on chromatin conformation in MCF - 7 cells . We verified ERα recruitment to chromatin after either E2 or 4OH treatment by immunofluorescence in detergent pre - extracted cells . Levels of chromatin - bound ( detergent - resistant ) ERα induced by 4OH are significantly higher than those observed with vehicle but are lower than with E2 ( Supplemental Fig . S5A ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . Using RT - qPCR , we also verified that 4OH impedes transcriptional activation of E2 - target genes . No induction of GREB1 mRNA is detected by 4OH treatment ( Fig . 3A ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . A low level of 4OH - induced NRIP1 expression is detected , but significantly lower than that seen with E2 . At the GREB1 locus the enhancer - promoter contact frequencies induced by E2 ( Fig . 2 ) are not seen with 4OH ( arrowheads in Figs 3B , C and Supplemental Fig . S5B , C ) . Consistent with the absence of transcription in response to 4OH , the increased short - range contact frequencies along the length of the GREB1 gene , that are induced in response to E2 ( Fig . 2 ) , are also absent in 4OH - treated cells ( Fig . 3B ; Supplemental Fig . S5B ) . Enhancer - promoter contact frequencies at NRIP1 are also diminished in 4OH , relative to E2 , treated cells ( Fig . 3B , C ; Supplemental Fig . S5B , C ) . Unlike with E2 , 4OH also does not induce any change in GREB1 or NRIP1 enhancer - promoter distances detected by DNA - FISH , compared with vehicle treated cells ( Fig . 3D , E ; Supplemental Fig . S5D ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . No changes in spatial distances between the GREB1 or NRIP1 enhancers and control probes are detected under any of the conditions ( Supplemental Fig . S5E ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . We conclude that both enhancer - promoter contact frequencies and enhancer - promoter spatial proximity are not simply the consequence of ERα recruitment but reflect the nature of the co - factors and transcriptional machinery recruited thereafter . Spatial proximity , but not enhancer - promoter contacts , depend on transcription . To investigate the role of the transcriptional machinery in enhancer - promoter contacts and spatial proximity , we analysed the effects of RNA polymerase II ( RPolII ) inhibition on E2 - induced changes in 3D chromosome conformation . 10 Flavopiridol inhibits CDK9 / PTEF - b activity , RNA polymerase II Ser2 CTD phosphorylation and transcription elongation , whereas triptolide inhibits transcription initiation via TFIIH and leads to degradation of RPolII ( Bensaude , 2011 ) . We treated hormone starved MCF - 7 cells with flavopiridol or triptolide for 5 min before adding E2 for 30 min ( Fig . 4A ) . In this time frame we do not expect significant reduction of global RpolII levels ( Jonkers et al . , 2014 , Chen et al . , 2015 ) . It was also reported that ERα , its co - activators , and the transcription machinery are still recruited to enhancers in the presence of flavopiridol , even though transcription of E2 target genes and eRNAs is inhibited ( Hah et al . , 2013 ) . As expected , both inhibitors abolished the E2 - dependent induction of GREB1 and NRIP1 mRNAs ( Fig . 4A ; Supplementary Table S4 ) but did not prevent the E2 - dependant association of ER a with chromatin , though this is diminished in the case of triptolide ( Supplemental Fig . S6A ) . E2 also still induced increased Capture - C enhancer - promoter contact frequencies at both GREB1 and NRIP1 in the presence of flavopiridol and triptolide ( Fig . 4B , C arrowhead and Supplemental Fig . S6B , C ) , but consistent with the inhibition of transcription , both inhibitors blocked the E2 - induced gain of short - range contacts across the GREB1 gene body . In contrast , flavopiridol and triptolide abolished the E2 - induced loss of enhancer - promoter spatial proximity at GREB1 and NRIP1 , as assayed by DNA FISH ( Fig . 4D , E ; Supplemental Fig . S6D ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . There was no effect of E2 on the distances between control probes under all conditions ( Supplemental Fig . S6E ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . The use of these two RPolII inhibitors therefore allows us to separate the effects of E2 addition on 3D genome organisation as assayed by chromosome conformation capture or DNA FISH : while enhancer - promoter contact frequencies assayed by Capture - C are not affected by transcription inhibition , the enhancer - promoter spatial separation observed by DNA - FISH is transcription - dependent . 11 Discussion Chromosome conformation capture and 3D DNA - FISH are linchpins methodologies for 3D genome investigation . For the most part data from these orthogonal approaches are congruent , but in a few cases spatial distances measured by DNA - FISH and proximity ligation frequencies from chromosome conformation capture between the same loci are not so readily reconciled ( Williamson et al . , 2014 ; Finn et al . , 2019 ) . One of the most intensively studied areas of 3D genome organisation is the relationship between enhancers and their target gene promoters . Whereas high - resolution chromosome conformation capture studies show enriched enhancer - promoter contact - frequencies ( Javierre et al . , 2016 ; Hsieh et al . , 2020 ) , there are several examples where live - cell imaging and 3D DNA - FISH in mammalian cells do not show the frequent enhancer - promoter proximity ( < 200nm ) that might be expected from the results of proximity ligation - based assays ( Alexander et al . , 2019 ; Benabdallah et al . , 2019 ; Platania et al . , 2023 ) . Contact - independent models are emerging that require general spatial enhancer - promoter proximity but not protracted enhancer - promoter direct contact for the activation of transcription ( Kane et al . , 2022 ; Karr et al . , 2022 ; Rinzema et al . , 2022 ) . Inducible systems are key to understanding how enhancer - promoter proximity is linked to gene activation . In mESCs , synthetic transcription factors have been used to study enhancer - driven gene activation unexpectedly revealing decreased enhancer - promoter spatial proximity upon enhancer activation ( Benabdallah et al . , 2019 , Kane et al . , 2022 ) , inconsistent with an enhancer - promoter direct contact looping model ( Karr et al . , 2022 ) . However , both the efficiency of transcription and the temporal resolution in these systems are low , such that events occurring immediately downstream of enhancer activation , and the genome organisation specific to transcribing alleles , may have been missed . Here we address these limitations using a system of rapid and efficient enhancer - dependent gene activation in MCF - 7 cells mediated by the binding of liganded ER a at the enhancers of two well studied target genes – GREB1 and NRIP1 . Upon hormone stimulation , ERα rapidly binds to the enhancers , which are already in an open chromatin state and bound by pioneer transcription factors ( Holding et al . , 2018 , Glont et al . , 2019 ) . This ensures rapid and highly efficient transcriptional induction of target genes – nascent RNA FISH showed that the majority of alleles are in the process of being transcribed 20 - 60 mins after E2 addition ( Fig . 1 ) . Data on 3D genome organisation assayed in the E2 - stimulated state is therefore chiefly attributable to actively transcribing alleles . 12 Using Capture - C we detected the increased enhancer - promoter contact frequencies upon hormone stimulation expected from enhancer - promoter looping models . However , DNA - FISH reveals a loss of enhancer - promoter spatial proximity at these same time points ( Fig . 2 ) , consistent with what we have seen at a developmental locus ( Benabdallah et al . , 2019 , Kane et al . , 2022 ) , and at target loci of another nuclear hormone receptor – the glucocorticoid receptor ( Jubb et al . , 2017 ) . We note that this contrasts with live cell imaging data in Drosophila embryos in which enhancer - driven transcription of a reporter gene corresponds to more sustained spatial proximity between the reporter and enhancer loci ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) . We used genetic and biochemical perturbations to dissect the molecular events driving these apparently opposing observations . Both the E2 - stimulated increased enhancer - promoter Capture - C contact frequencies , and the decreased spatial separation detected by DNA - FISH , depend on the presence of the enhancers ( Fig . 2 ) . This contrasts with the lack of significant enhancer - promoter distance changes measured at the Sox2 locus in mESCs when the SCR enhancer is mutated compared to wild - type cells ( Platania et al . , 2023 ) . Both the E2 - stimulated increased enhancer - promoter Capture - C contact frequencies , and the decreased spatial separation , also depend on liganded ERα recruiting co - activator complexes and / or components of the transcription machinery , since they are lost in the presence of the ERα antagonist tamoxifen ( Fig . 3 ) . Finally , the use of transcription inhibitors allowed us to further disentangle the drivers of enhancer - promoter contact frequencies and spatial proximity . While E2 - dependent enhancer - promoter contact frequencies persist when transcription initiation or elongation are blocked with triptolide or flavopiridol , the E2 - dependent loss of enhancer - promoter proximity seen by DNA - FISH is abrogated ( Fig . 4 ) . In the time frame of the experiments performed here , ERα - along with co - activators and the transcription machinery , is known to be still recruited to chromatin by E2 in the presence of these inhibitors ( Jonkers et al . , 2014 , Chen et al . , 2015 , Hah et al . , 2013 ) . It was reported that transcription inhibition has little impact on higher order 3D chromatin organization in mESCs ( Hsieh et al . , 2020 ) while enhancer - promoter contact frequencies were shown to be somewhat reduced ( Hsieh et al . , 2020 , Barshad et al . , 2023 ) . It should be noted however , that this reduction is only noticeable at the genome wide level and that the foci of these interactions were largely unaffected ( Hsieh et al . , 2020 , Barshad et al . , 2023 ) . Our observations also appear to differ from what has been seen at the Sox2 - SCR locus in mESCs where triptolide has no affect on measured enhancer - promoter differences ( Platania et al . , 2023 ) . However a notable difference is that whereas Sox2 is being actively transcribed in mESCs , here we are looking at the acute transcriptional induction of genes from an inactive state . 13 We conclude that the gain of enhancer - promoter contact frequencies detected by Capture - C coincides with E2 - liganded ER a recruitment to enhancers , whereas decreased enhancer - promoter proximity corresponds with E2 - dependent transcription . Most noticeably in the case of NRIP1 , increased enhancer - promoter separation occurs as soon as 5 min after E2 stimulation . This is before nascent transcription of the gene is detected by either TT - seq or RNA FISH ( Fig . 1 ) . However some , albeit not statistically significant , transcription of eRNAs is detected at this early timepoint ( Supplemental Fig . S1 ) . We also detected an enrichment of short - range , and depletion of longer - range , Capture - C interactions along gene bodies linked to E2 - induced transcription , . These depend on transcription , being lost in the presence of tamoxifen or transcription inhibitors . This is most noticeable in the case of GREB1 , a long gene with approximately 30 exons , in comparison with NRIP1’s simple gene structure ( up to 4 exons ) . These observations are compatible with a model in which genes stiffen and decompact as the transcription machinery elongates through , and nascent RNAs and RNA binding proteins coat , the gene bodies constraining their ability to make longer - range contacts ( Leidescher et al . , 2022 ) . At the cell population level , we observe increased Capture - C contact frequencies between regions that , at the same time , appear to become further apart , on average within the nucleus . Whilst imaging data is collected from almost every allele in the few hundred cells that are imaged per experiment , it is not know what proportion of alleles in the millions of cells that go into the Hi - C reaction contribute to the enhancer - promoter contact frequencies detected in Capture - C . We therefore cannot exclude that there is very transient physical contact between the enhancers and promoters that is too infrequent to detect by DNA - FISH , but that is captured by Capture - C . However , the fact that most of the alleles we visualise in this system are being actively transcribed means that such a “kiss and run” contact is not required for each burst of transcription . Both 3C techniques and DNA - FISH rely on protein - protein and DNA - protein crosslinking with formaldehyde , which is widely used and yet incompletely understood ( Hoffman et al . , 2015 ) . The recruitment of ER a , co - activators and the transcriptional machinery results in megadaltons of potentially additional cross - linkable protein complexes at ER - responsive enhancers following E2 , but not 4OH , treatment . Crosslinking between somewhat distant genomic regions is also plausible via a crosslinked meshwork of macromolecules that bridge between two loci . This crosslinking radius is thought to depend on protein occupancy , the abundance of specific amino acids and crosslinking efficiency ( Gavrilov et al . , 2015 ; Giorgetti et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , we note that the P r o m o t e r O F F Med Med GTF M ed G TF EnhancerOFF Pioneer TFs TFs , co - activators RNA binding proteins E2 PromoterON polII polII polII EnhancerON ER Capture - C contact frequency distance E2 + FLV / TRP Promoter OFF polII ER transcription inhibition EnhancerON Capture - C contact frequency distance Tamoxifen P r o m o t e r O F F ER EnhancerOFF Capture - C contact frequency distance ER α RNA PolII 14 physical enhancer - promoter distances we measure upon E2 stimulation might fall within estimated 3C crosslinking and ligation radii ( Giorgetti et al . , 2016 , Finn et al . , 2019 ) . Formaldehyde crosslinking is also affected by protein dynamics . Protein cross - linking to DNA requires a long residence time ( many seconds ) ( Schmiedeberg et al . , 2009 ; Teves et al . , 2016 ) and proteins can artifactually concentrate into large puncta , or can appear to leave foci , during fixation if the fixation rate is slower than protein diffusion rates ( Irgen - Gioro et al . 2022 ) . E2 - dependent increases in enhancer - promoter contact frequencies detected by Capture - C could therefore be influenced by the residence time and exchange rates of the large multicomponent protein complexes recruited by ER a ( Fig . 5 ) . In contrast , the loss of enhancer - promoter spatial proximity detected by DNA - FISH appears to be linked to the production of RNAs ( eRNA and mRNA ) at the target loci , perhaps due to the effect of these RNAs on biomolecular condensate formation ( Lee et al . , 2021 ) . Our work reinforces that high resolution enhancer - promoter contact frequencies derived from 3C techniques cannot be simply interpreted as physical distances . Further careful consideration needs to be given to how dynamics and the functional , biochemical and biophysical environments of genomic loci in different biological systems and under different conditions may impact the data obtained from imaging and chromosome conformation assays . 15 Methods Cell culture and treatments MCF - 7 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , GIBCO021969 - 035 ) , high glucose and supplemented with 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 units / ml penicillin , 6 . 5 μg / ml streptomycin and 10 % foetal calf serum ( FCS , Gibco 10270 ) . Before hormone stimulation , cells were seeded in growth media and 24hr later transferred into starving media comprising phenol - red free DMEM , penicillin / streptomycin and 10 % charcoal - stripped FCS for 96hr . Cells were transferred into phenol - red free DMEM supplemented with either 10 nM 17ß - estradiol ( Sigma E2758 ) ( + E2 ) or ethanol ( - E2 ) for the indicated time points . 100 mM Tamoxifen ( Sigma T3652 ) ( 4OH ) was used .

Library PCRs were supplemented with 2× SYBR dye ( Sigma S9430 ) to monitor amplification by quantitative ( q ) PCR on a Roche LightCycler 480 . To allow for sample multiplexing , PCRs were performed using index primers ( NEBNext multiplex oligos for Illumina , set 1 , E7335 ) and amplified to linear phase . Libraries were combined as an equimolar pool and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq on a single high - output flow cell ( paired - end 75 - bp reads ) .

Replicates were merged in single bigwig file using deeptools bigwigCompare using the mean operation . Read counts over specific genomic regions were computed using featureCounts v2 . 0 . 1 ( options : - p - Q 10 - s 2 ) .

To compute read counts over intergenic regions , pooled ATAC - seq peaks ( Guan et al . , 2019 , see below for methods ) at least 1kb away from annotated TSSs and extended 1 . 5 kb at each side , were used . Differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR on R . ChiP - seq data analysis Data from Zwart et al .

RNA - FISH Custom Stellaris RNA FISH probes were designed against GREB1 and NRIP1 nascent mRNA first introns ( pool of 48 unique 22 - base polymer probes ) using the Stellaris RNA FISH Probe Designer ( www . biosearchtech . com / stellarisdesigner ( version 4 . 2 ) ) . 4x10 5 MCF - 7 cells were seeded on Thermo Scientific SuperFrost Plus Adhesion slides ( 15438060 ) , starved and treated as specified . Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( pFa ) in PBS for 10 min , rinsed with PBS 3 x for 2 min and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 10 min . Following 3 x 2 min 17 rinses , slides were incubated in wash buffer ( 2× SSC , 10 % deionized formamide ) for 5 mins at r . t . Slides were hybridized with GREB1 or NRIP1 Stellaris FISH Probe sets labeled with Quasar 670 ( Biosearch Technologies ) following the manufacturer’s instructions ( www . biosearchtech . com / stellarisprotocols ) . RNA FISH probes were hybridised to slides as previously described ( Kane et al . , 2022 ) . 3D DNA - FISH Probe preparation : For fosmid probes ( Supplementary Table S6 ) , 1 μg of fosmid DNA was labeled by nick translation to incorporate biotin - dUTP ( Roche 11093070910 ) or digoxigenin - dUTP ( Roche 11093088910 ) and prepared for hybridisation as previously described ( Boyle et al . , 2020 ) . For 10kb PCR probes ( Supplementary Table S6 ) , fragments generated by PCR from BAC templates ( Supplementary Table S7 ) were cloned into TOPO - TA plasmids ( Invitrogen ) . 1 μg of plasmid DNA was labeled by nick translation to incorporate biotin - dUTP ( Roche 11093070910 ) , digoxigenin - dUTP ( Roche 11093088910 ) or Green496 - dUTP - labeled ( Enzo Life Sciences ) and used as above . Cell fixing , denaturing and hybridization : Cells were seeded , starved , treated , fixed and permeabilized as for RNA - FISH . Following permeabilization and rinsing , slides were air dried and stored at - 80°C till use . Slides were incubated in 100 μg / mL RNase A in 2× SSC for 1 hr at 37°C , washed briefly in 2× SSC , passed through an ethanol series ( 70 , 90 and 100 % , 2 min in each ) , and air - dried . Slides were incubated for 5 min in a dry incubator at 70°C , denatured in 70 % formamide / 2× SSC ( pH 7 . 5 ) for 40 min at 80°C , cooled in 70 % ethanol for 2 min on ice , and dehydrated by immersion in 90 % ethanol for 2 min and 100 % ethanol for 2 min prior to air drying . Probes in hybridization mix were added to the slides and incubated o / n at 37 °C . Following a series of washes in 2× SSC ( 45 °C ) and 0 . 1× SSC ( 60 °C ) , slides were blocked in blocking buffer ( 4× SSC , 5 % Marvel ) for 5 mins . For 2 - color detection ( either with fosmid or 10 kb derived probes ) , the following antibody dilutions were made : anti - digoxigenin - Rhodamine FAB fragments ( Roche , cat . no . 11207750910 ) 1 : 20 ; Texas Red anti - sheep 1 : 100 ( Abcam ab6745 ) and Avidin - FITC1 : 500 ( Vector Laboratories A - 2011 ) ; biotinylated anti - avidin ( Vector Laboratories , cat . no . BA - 0300 ) 1 : 100 , and Avidin - FITC 1 : 500 . For 3 - color detection the following antibody dilutions were made : anti - digoxigenin ( Roche , cat . 11333089001 ) 1 : 10 ; AF647 anti - seep ( Invitrogen , cat . A - 21448 ) 1 : 10 and Texas Red avidin ( Vector Laboratories , cat . no . A - 2016 ) 1 : 500 ; biotinylated anti - avidin ( Vector Laboratories ) 1 : 100 ; Texas Red avidin ( Vector Laboratories , cat . no . A - 2016 ) 1 : 500 . Slides were incubated with antibody in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 30 – 60 mins in the following order , with 4× SSC / 0 . 1 % Tween 20 washes in between : fluorescein anti - digoxigenin , 18 fluorescein anti - sheep , biotinylated anti - avidin , streptavidin - Cy5 for 3 - color detection ; Texas Red avidin , biotinylated anti - avidin , Texas Red avidin for 2 - color detection . Slides were treated with a 1 : 1 , 000 dilution of DAPI ( stock 50 µg / mL ) for 5 mins before mounting in Vectashield . Image acquisition and deconvolution Slides from RNA and DNA FISH using fosmid derived probes were imaged on an epifluorescence microscope as previously described ( Boyle et al . , 2020 ) . Step size for z stacks was set to 0 . 2 µm . Hardware control and image capture were performed using Nikon Nis - Elements software ( Nikon ) and images were deconvolved using a calculated PSF with the constrained iterative algorithm in Volocity ( PerkinElmer ) . RNA FISH signal quantification was carried out using the quantitation module of Volocity ( PerkinElmer ) . Number of expressing alleles were calculated by segmenting the hybridization signals and scoring each nucleus as containing 0 , 1 or 2 RNA signals . DNA FISH measurements were made using the quantitation module of Volocity ( PerkinElmer ) and only alleles with single probe signals were analysed to eliminate the possibility of measuring sister chromatids . Slides for DNA FISH using 10kb probes were imaged on a SoRa spinning disk confocal microscope ( Nikon CSU - W1 SoRa ) in 0 . 1 μm steps . Images were denoised and deconvolved using NIS deconvolution software ( blind preset ) ( Nikon ) and DNA FISH measurements were as for fosmid probes . Capture - C The Capture - C protocol experiments was adapted from ( Golov et al . , 2020 ) , with 3C libraries captured with biotin labelled fragments from BACs covering the regions of interest ( Supplementary Table S7 ) . 3C library preparation : 3x10 6 MCF - 7 cells were seeded in 10 cm plates , starved and treated as described above . Cells were crosslinked , lysed into nuclei and chromatin was fragmentated and in situ proximity ligated as decribed ( Golov et al . , 2020 ) . For chromatin fragmentation , 350 U of DpnII 50U / µl ( NEB cat . R0543M ) in 300 µl 1x NEBuffer DpnII ( NEB cat . B0543S ) were used . After de - crosslinking and DNA extraction ( Golov et al . , 2020 ) 5 µg of DNA in 500 µl sonication buffer ( 25 mM Tris - HCL pH8 . 0 , 20 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 % SDS ) were sonicated using MSE Soniprep 150 Plus at medium power for two 30 sec pulses on ice to shear DNA to a size of 150 - 700 bp . 1 µg of the resulting DNA was used for library preparation using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® ( NEB cat . E7103 ) . Library PCRs were supplemented with 1× EvaGreen ( Jena 19 Bioscience cat . PCR - 379 ) . qPCRs were performed using index primers ( NEBNext multiplex oligos for Illumina , set 1 , E7335 ) and amplified to linear phase ( 3 - 5 PCR cycles ) . Biotin - bait preparation : 5 ug of pooled equimolar amounts of the selected BACs ( Supplementary Table S7 ) were sonicated as described above for 3C libraries . Equimolarity was calculated by qPCR using primers against the chloramphenicol resistance gene ( Supplementary Table S7 ) . Forked adapters ( Supplementary Table S7 ) were annealed in NEBuffer 2 1X ( NEB cat . B7002S ) to a final concentration of 20 µM in a thermal cycler set to heat at 98°C and gradually cool down to 4°C with a 1°C per 20 sec gradient . Shredded BACs were subjected to end - preparation , A - tailing and adapter ligation as described ( Golov et al . , 2020 ) . BAC baits were PCR amplified using 5’ biotinylated forward and reverse primers ( Supplementary Table S7 ) in the following reaction mix : 10 µl 2X NEBNext® Ultra™ II Q5® Master Mix ( NEB cat . M0544S ) , 1 µl 10 µM each bio - primer , 2 µl adapter - ligated BAC DNA , 1X EvaGreen ( Jena Bioscience cat . PCR - 379 ) . The number of amplification cycles ( in the linear phase of the reaction ) , determined in a test qPCR , usually fell between 7 and 9 cycles . Around 3 µg of biotinylated baits were obtained from 25 reactions . Hybridization and biotin - pulldown : For each experiment , equal amounts of all libraries corresponding to each sample and amplified with different barcodes , were pooled and captured as a pool . One hybridization reaction was done per 1 µg of library pool . Hybridization and biotin - pulldown was done as described ( Golov et al . , 2020 ) . Singly enriched 3C libraries were amplified by qPCR using p5 / p7 primers ( Supplementary Table S7 ) as described above ( Biotin - bait preparation ) . PCR reactions were performed with the DNA still bound to the streptavidin beads . The number of amplification cycles ( in the linear phase of the reaction ) , determined in a test qPCR , usually fell in between 13 and 16 . A second hybridization reaction , biotin pulldown and PCR amplification was performed as before . The number of PCR cycles usually fell between 7 and 10 cycles . The pool was sequenced using either an Illumina NextSeq 500 on a single midium - output flow cell ( paired - end 75 - bp reads ) or an Illumina Nextseq 2000 using a single P1 flow cell ( paired - end 75 - bp reads ) . Capture - C data analysis and generation of virtual 4C profiles Capture - C data were aligned to the hg19 genome and processed using distiller - nf 0 . 3 . 3 ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 3350937 ) with default settings . Coolers filtered for q > = 30 were used and ICE balanced ( Imakaev et al . , 2012 ) using the cooler ( Abdennur et al . , 2020 ) command ' cooler balance - - cis _ only - - blacklist blacklist . bed ' where blacklist . bed contains all regions outside 20 of the capture probe area . Balanced contact frequencies were visualised using HiGlass in resgen . io ( Kerpedjiev et al . , 2018 ) . Virtual 4C data were generated by extracting the balanced contact frequency values from all bins overlapping the viewpoint using cooltools ( Open2C et al . , 2022 ) and summing them . Plots were generated using seaborn ( Waskom , 2021 ) . In the case of GREB1 locus , analysis was done at a 5 kb resolution and heatmaps and plots are shown between the coordinates chr2 : 11602736 - 11790379 ( hg19 ) . In the case of NRIP1 locus , analysis was done at a 10 kb resolution and heatmaps and plots are shown between the coordinates chr21 : 16263224 - 16630829 ( hg19 ) . RT - qPCR RNA from cells grown in 6 well plates was extracted using TRIZOL ( Invitrogen 15596026 ) and reverse transcribed using Superscirpt II Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen 18064022 ) with random decamers . qPCR was performed using the CFX96 Touch Real - Time PCR Detection System ( Bio - Rad ) and the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix ( Roche 04887352001 ) . The mean relative expression of technical replicates of each sample was measure by the CFX Manager software ( Bio - Rad ) according to a calibration serial dilutions curve and normalized to the mean of U2 RNA expression . Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S5 . Statistical analyses DNA - FISH inter - probe distance data sets were compared using the two - tailed Mann - Whitney U test .

Model for enhancer - promoter communication leading to increased Capture - C contact frequencies but loss of spatial proximity during transcriptional activation . Upon estradiol ( E2 ) stimulation , ERα binds to enhancers recruiting co - activators and the transcription machinery , and leading to the transcription of eRNAs and target mRNAs . This produces increased enhancer - promoter contact frequencies and yet increased spatial separation of enhancer and promoter ( top right ) . When transcription is inhibited with flavopiridol ( FLV ) or triptolide ( TRP ) during E2 stimulation , ERα , co - activators and the transcription machinery are still recruited but without the transcription of eRNAs or mRNAs . This still produces increased enhancer - promoter contact frequencies without changes in spatial distance ( middle right ) . With tamoxifen as ligand , ERα binds to the enhancers but recruits co - repressors , thus not inducing the activation of the target genes . In this context , neither enhancer - promoter contact frequencies nor spatial distances change in comparison with the unstimulated situation ( bottom right ) . We speculate that the increase in enhancer - promoter contact frequencies observed upon hormone stimulation is driven by the recruitment of large multicomponent protein compexes while increased enhancer - promoter spatial separation seems to linked to the molecular events associated with transcription . 24 Author contributions L .

After 2 hours ( hrs ) incubation at 37 °C , the pH was adjusted to 4 . 2 using HCl and a charcoal mix ( for 1 litre : 5 g charcoal ( Sigma - Aldrich 05105 ) , 25 mg dextran T70 ( USP , 1179741 ) , 50 ml water ) was added and incubated overnight ( o / n ) at 4 °C with stirring . Charcoal was removed by centrifugation at 500 g for 30 mins at 4 °C , the pH re - adjusted to 4 . 2 and a second charcoal mix added , incubated and then removed . Centrifugation was repeated to remove residual charcoal and the pH adjusted to 7 . 2 with NaOH . Stripped FCS was filter sterilized , aliquoted and stored at - 20°C . CRISPR deletions pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - GFP ( PX458 , Addgene 48138 ) plasmids including either the left or right gRNA ( Supplementary Table S5 ) were co - transfected into MCF - 7 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Invitrogen , L3000015 ) . After 24 hrs , single GFP + ve cells were seeded into 96 well plates . Cell lysates from different clones were obtained using DirectPCR Lysis Reagent ( Viagen Biotech , 102 - T ) and genotyping was performed by PCR using the primers in Supplementary Table S5 . PCR bands were cloned into the TOPO - TA cloning kit ( Invitrogen , 450071 ) and validated by Sanger sequencing . Immunofluorescence 4x10 5 MCF - 7 cells were seeded on Thermo Scientific SuperFrost Plus Adhesion slides ( 15438060 ) , starved and treated as specified above . Before fixing , cells were rinsed with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for a few seconds and then slides were fixed with pFa 4 % in PBS for 10 min , rinsed with PBS 3 times for 2 min and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 10 min . Following 3x 2 min PBS rinses , slides were blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 30 min at r . t . and incubated with 1 : 250 mouse anti ERα antibody ( F - 10 , Santa Cruz , cat . Sc - 8002 ) in 1 % BSA in PBS for 1h . Slides were rinsed twice in PBS for 2 min and incubated for 45 min with 1 : 500 Goat anti - Mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody ( Invitrogen , cat . A11001 ) in 1 % BSA / PBS . After rinsing , 31 slides were incubated with a 1 : 1 , 000 dilution of DAPI ( stock 50 µg / mL ) for 5 mins before mounting in Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories , cat . H1000 ) . Slides for immunofluorescence were imaged on an epifluorescence microscope ( Zeiss AxioImager 2 , camera Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 . 0 16 - bit ) and nuclear fluorescence intensity was quantified using CellProfiler v3 . 1 . 8 .
