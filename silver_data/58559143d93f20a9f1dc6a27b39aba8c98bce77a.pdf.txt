SARS - CoV - 2 in Cardiac Emergencies INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic imposed diverse challenges on health care providers and hospitals . For instance , hospitals needed to rapidly redistribute and reorganize resources to treat acutely ill COVID - 19 patients while keeping up with other emergencies . At the same time outmost attention had to be spent on containing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) to protect other patients and staﬀ . Apart from rising numbers of COVID - 19 patients , a change in the presentation pattern of non - COVID emergencies was observed . In that light , it was recently shown that hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) declined during the pandemic ( 1 – 4 ) . Apart from a decrease in presentations , morbidity and mortality of non - COVID - 19 emergencies might have changed because hospitals may not be able to provide optimal care due to restructured resources and uncertainties how to deal with potentially infected patients ( 5 ) . Position papers consequently recommended to stratify treatment of cardiovascular emergencies according to cardiovascular risk : ( 1 ) only high - risk emergencies ( e . g . , ST elevation myocardial infarction ) should be treated immediately with usage of personal protective equipment as in conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases ; ( 2 ) other emergencies and elective procedures should only be carried out after receiving results of SARS - CoV - 2 testing ( 6 – 8 ) . A better understanding of the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infections may help to guide timely management and reasonable usage of personal protective equipment without aﬀecting the safety of staﬀ and other patients . We here sought to investigate the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in asymptomatic patients presenting with cardiac emergencies . METHODS Study Cohort The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee ( 323 / 20 S ) and conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki . We retrospectively analyzed patients’ data from a tertiary cardiology department which provides 24 / 7 interventional cardiac care between April 15 and May 31 , 2020 ( i . e . , at the peak of the pandemic’s ﬁrst wave in the region ) . Screening of Patients All patients were screened on admission for COVID - 19 symptoms using a questionnaire and had their body temperature measured ( ear thermometer ) . Patients were assigned as COVID - 19 asymptomatic when none of the following criteria were met : body temperature ≥ 38 . 1 ◦ C , coughing , shortness of breath , runny nose , sore throat , or body aches . Additionally , patients were asked whether they had been in contact to a conﬁrmed COVID - 19 case or a patient suﬀering from fever and coughing without proven SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Patients reporting shortness of breath were also regarded as COVID - 19 asymptomatic if they did not report one of the other criteria . COVID - 19 asymptomatic patients were required to wear standard surgical masks ( no FIGURE 1 | ( A ) Daily reported cases ( Bayerisches Landesamt für Gesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit , accessed on 07 - 15 - 2020 ) and prevalence ( Daily Situation Report of the Robert Koch Institute , accessed on 07 - 15 - 2020 ) of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in the Free State of Bavaria during the study period .

These protective measurements were recently shown to reduce in particular the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection for healthcare workers ( 9 ) . N95 masks or FFP2 - 3 masks and further dedicated protective equipment were only used when treating SARS - CoV - 2 conﬁrmed or suspected patients . SARS - CoV - 2 Testing All hospitalized patients were routinely screened for SARS - CoV - 2 using nasopharyngeal swab testing ( SARS - CoV - 2 real - time polymerase chain reaction assay , Mikrogen Diagnostik , Neuried , Germany ) since April 15 , 2020 . Patients without COVID - 19 symptoms were only planned to be tested at admission . Repeated testing was performed if patients developed symptoms or if a more recent test result was required for transferal to other treatment facilities . RESULTS Until May 31 , 2020 , a total of 710 patients presented and were included this analysis .

Nasopharyngeal swab tests were available in 689 ( 97 % ) patients , 409 and 280 of which presented as urgent [ reasons : coronary 116 / 409 ( 28 . 4 % ) , structural 42 / 409 ( 10 . 3 % ) , heart failure 8 / 409 ( 2 % ) , electrophysiology 209 / 409 ( 51 . 1 % ) , other 34 / 409 ( 8 . 3 % ) ] and emergency admissions , respectively . As a suspected SARS - CoV - 2 infection may have reduced the likelihood of presenting with a non - emergency leading to an underestimation of the actual prevalence , we focused on the 280 patients admitted as cardiac emergencies . Baseline characteristics and reasons for admission are displayed in Table 1 . None of these COVID - 19 asymptomatic patients tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . During the hospital stay , 27 ( 9 . 6 % ) of patients were repeatedly tested with no test revealing a positive result . In the total cohort , only one patient was diagnosed to be SARS - CoV - 2 positive ( Figure 1B ) . The patient was sent in home quarantine and treatment was scheduled to be performed after 14 days of quarantine and two subsequent negative nasopharyngeal swabs . This patient remained asymptomatic and no further testing was performed during quarantine . DISCUSSION This result needs to be reviewed in the context of the overall SARS - CoV - 2 prevalence in the respective region during the observation period . During the study period , ∼ 300 cases per 100 , 000 citizens were reported in the Free State of Bavaria . Thus , our data indicate that in cardiac emergency patients which were screened negative for COVID - 19 symptoms , the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in regions with a modest overall prevalence is low . Under these circumstances , our ﬁndings indicate that a delay / deferral of emergency procedures due to waiting for SARS - CoV - 2 test results may not be justiﬁed in emergency patients which are screened asymptomatic for COVID - 19 , but have an unclear SARS - CoV - 2 infectious status . While our ﬁnding is in line with a recent report from Iceland , where in a random - sample screening of the population , 0 . 6 % tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( 10 ) , a study screening pregnant women admitted for delivery in New York City found that 13 . 5 % of tested women were asymptomatic but tested positive ( 11 ) . In summary , the frequency of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 carriers among cardiac emergency patients is low when the overall prevalence of COVID - 19 is modest . Consequently , emergency but also elective procedures may safely be carried out without delay and waiting for SARS - CoV - 2 test results . Importantly , the safety of personnel and patients may be further increased by implementation of rapid or point - of - care tests which despite potential drawbacks [ for an overview , see ( 12 ) ] recently revealed promising results ( 13 ) . Our study was performed during a time period in which the prevalence of COVID - 19 in Bavaria was rather low and our ﬁndings are therefore inherently not applicable in regions with higher prevalence . It was also previously shown that the highest sensitivity of SARS - CoV - 2 was reached bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid ( 14 ) and we may have missed SARS - CoV - 2 infection due to only performing nasopharyngeal swab testing . Additional major limitations are the retrospective nature of this analysis and that the data are derived from a single center . The low prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection may therefore be due to chance and requires validation in further cohorts to draw deﬁnitive conclusions . Our data may nevertheless be helpful to better determine timing of emergency procedures and reasonable usage of protective equipment during the COVID - 19 crisis and the future .
