Much attention has been focused on the molecular mechanism of the fi rst step of this movement , protrusion and its regulation ( Small et al . , 2002 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Far fewer efforts have dealt with how the molecular mechanisms actually produce protru - sive force ( Condeelis , 1993 ; Bray , 2001 ) , and even fewer make a quantitative prediction of what the protrusive force should be ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 , 2003 ; Carlsson , 2003 ; Dickinson et al . , 2004 ) . Despite earlier attempts to measure lamellar stiff - ness using microneedles ( Felder and Elson , 1990 ) and recent attempts to ascertain the lamellar protrusive force indirectly ( Ladam et al . , 2005 ; Bohnet et al . , 2006 ) , it has never been measured directly . The goal of this study was to measure the maximum ( stall ) force the lamellipod could produce and the characteristic force - velocity relation for the lamellipod . Such information would be invaluable in evaluating quantitative mod - els for protrusive force production by the lamella of migrating cells . The concept was to place a fl exible barrier of known stiff - ness in front of a portion of the leading edge of a migrating cell . Defl ection of the barrier by the moving cell would apply a load force to that portion of the advancing lamellipod . The lamel - lipod will apply an equal and opposite protrusive force to the barrier , and , as the load force increases , the lamellipod velocity will decrease eventually to zero when the leading edge stalls . At this point , the maximum possible protrusive force will be exerted by the cell against the load . Results and discussion To experimentally implement this concept , we fabricated a micro - scope stage that permits the positioning of a soft SiN atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) cantilever in the path of a migrating fi sh keratocyte ( Fig . 1 , a and b ) . Particularly critical is the height adjustment : it must block the thin lamellipod without touching the substrate , which would produce a stall that occurs too quickly because of the lamella pushing a cantilever that is not free . The pyramidal tip of the cantilever , which is normally for scanning the sample , could be imaged ( Fig . 1 c ) , and its position could be measured to subpixel accuracy as the cell defl ected it . Fig . 1 c ( also see Video 1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200601159 / DC1 ) shows selected frames from the entire time course of the experiment , from initial contact with the edge at t = 0 to deformation of the lamella at t = 30 s , contact with the nuclear mound at 60 s , maximal defl ection of the cantilever at 233 s , and ending with release of the cantilever Direct measurement of the lamellipodial protrusive force in a migrating cell Marcus Prass , 1 Ken Jacobson , 2 , 3 Alex Mogilner , 4 , 5 and Manfred Radmacher 1 1 Institute of Biophysics , University of Bremen , D - 28359 Bremen , Germany 2 Department of Cell and Developmental Biology and 3 Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC 27599 4 Department of Mathematics and 5 Center for Genetics and Development , University of California , Davis , Davis , CA 95616 T here has been a great deal of interest in the mech - anism of lamellipodial protrusion ( Pollard , T . , and G . Borisy . 2003 . Cell . 112 : 453 – 465 ) . However , one of this mechanism’s endpoints , the force of protrusion , has never been directly measured . We place an atomic force microscopy cantilever in the path of a migrating keratocyte . The deﬂ ection of the cantilever , which occurs over a period of (cid:3) 10 s , provides a direct measure of the force exerted by the lamellipodial leading edge . Stall forces are consistent with (cid:3) 100 polymerizing actin ﬁ la - ments per micrometer of the leading edge , each working as an elastic Brownian ratchet and generating a force of several piconewtons . However , the force - velocity curves obtained from this measurement , in which velocity drops sharply under very small loads , is not sensitive to low loading forces , and ﬁ nally stalls rapidly at large loads , are not consistent with current theoretical models for the actin polymerization force . Rather , the curves indicate that the protrusive force generation is a complex multiphase process involving actin and adhesion dynamics .

The online version of this article contains supplemental material . JCB • VOLUME 174 • NUMBER 6 • 2006 768 after the cell moves on ( Video 1 , frame at 260 s ) . Knowing the stiffness of the cantilever and measuring its defl ection ( see Ma - terials and methods ) permits the load force to be calculated by Hooke’s Law as the cell moves against the cantilever ( Fig . 2 a ) . The load force increases with time until a stall of the entire cell occurs , after which the cell escapes and the load force drops abruptly to zero . The whole cell stall force ( stalling the forward translocation of the cell body rather than blocking the lamelli - podial leading edge protrusion ) is (cid:3) 40 nN , which is consistent with previous results on keratocytes using calibrated microneedles ( Oliver et al . , 1995 ) . One of the features in Fig . 2 a is the period of initial con - tact , which is highlighted . This section is expanded in Fig . 2 b . The initial contact of the lamellipod is followed by a rapid in - crease in load force as the lamellipod pushes the cantilever , eventually stalling after 6 – 8 s ( Fig . 2 b , highlighted section ) . One issue was whether a portion of the lamellipod adjacent to the substrate actually slipped under the cantilever as opposed to the cantilever blocking the lamellipod as desired . We inves - tigated this by rapid fi xation shortly after the cantilever struck the leading edge of the cells using a protocol described by Lee and Jacobson ( 1997 ) . Such a cell is seen in Fig . 2 c stained for fi lamentous actin by rhodamine - phalloidin . Contact - mode AFM of the same fi xed cell ( Fig . 2 d ) demonstrates that no part of the lamellipod slipped under the cantilever , as bare substra - tum can be seen where the cantilever indented the leading edge . ( It should be noted that the indentation at that time is much larger than the indentations when the protrusion force is mea - sured in the fi rst 10 s after cantilever contact ; such indentations are more diffi cult to visualize ) . This suggests that the lamel - lipod behaves as an integral unit consistent with its inherent stiffness ( Felder and Elson , 1990 ) . In addition , the region at the base of the indentation , which actually has closed somewhat by the time fi xation has occurred , does not appear to be apprecia - bly higher . The typical height of the lamellipod of a keratocyte is only (cid:3) 140 – 200 nm ( Laurent et al . , 2005 ) . This corroborates the assertion that the contact length of the cantilever where it hits the lamellipod will be (cid:3) 3 μ m ; this is the long dimension of the cantilever at its base ( Fig . 1 b ) .

PROTRUSION FORCES OF MIGRATING CELLS • PRASS ET AL . 769 Note that after the leading edge is stalled locally , the parts of the leading edge adjacent to the stalled region continue to advance and deform , and , on the scale of tens of seconds , the lamellipodial actin network undergoes signifi cant remodeling so that the lamellipod “sneaks around” the cantilever . In (cid:3) 20 s , the cantilever hits the mound of the cell body and starts to de - fl ect signifi cantly ( Fig . 2 and Video 2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200601159 / DC1 ) . Three representative examples of the force versus time curves are given in Fig . 3 ( a , c , and e ) . Because the cantilever is assumed to maintain contact with the protruding lamellipod , differentiating the position of the cantilever as a function of time gives the velocity of that portion of the lamellipod . This enables force - velocity relations to be plotted for each force - time curve as shown in Fig . 3 ( b , d , and f ) . The mean stall force ( where the cantilever movements stops , at least momentarily ) is 1 . 18 ± 0 . 35 nN ( SD ; n = 12 ) . Table I shows the variability in individual cells regarding stall force , initial cantilever velocity at the point where it contacts the cell , and velocity of the trailing edge of the cell at the moment the cantilever contacts the lead - ing edge . These two velocities are uncorrelated , and neither of them is correlated with the stall force . A surprising element of this study was that the initial can - tilever velocity , rather than being equal to the cell body forward translocation rate , was considerably ( by about a factor of seven ) reduced ( Table I ) , indicating that the protrusion rate decreases abruptly upon contact . Mechanically speaking , this decrease could be caused by initial contact and loading not visible to us ( forces of the order of ≤ 100 pN would cause defl ections so small that they would be undetectable from the images ) . Chemically speaking , signaling material that accumulated on the cantilever does not appear to be a factor , as the velocity reduction effect is seen with both clean cantilevers and those used multiple times . Rather , the leading edge of the cell ap - pears to slow down just before or at the initial instant of strik - ing the cantilever . To ask when this reduction in lamellipodial velocity occurred , we used refl ection interference contrast microscopy ( RICM ) in which close adhesions at the cell ven - tral surface and the cantilever as a stationary obstacle could be simultaneously visualized . To avoid pronounced refl ections from the gold - coated cantilever , which obscures events when the cantilever is in close proximity to the leading edge , we used uncoated SiN cantilevers . This setup enabled us to observe that lamellipod slowdown occurs within typically ≤ 2 pixels ( corresponding to 232 nm ; n = 12 ) in front of the cantilever ( Fig . 4 and Video 2 ) . If there is a narrow nonadherent rim of the leading edge that extends beyond the most anterior close contacts visualized by RICM ( Lee and Jacobson , 1997 ) , slow - down occurs even closer to the cantilever . At this juncture , we favor the idea that the cell mechanically senses the presence of the proximate cantilever and tunes the protrusion velocity and force generation mechanism accordingly ( see the last two paragraphs of this section ) . However , remote sensing by the cell of chemical / electrochemical gradients on the tens of nanometer – length scale cannot be absolutely ruled out . Our provisional interpretation of the stall forces is as fol - lows . If we assume that the 3 - μ m region of the lamellipod edge in contact with the cantilever is stalled independently of the rest of the lamellipodial edge and that (cid:3) 4 pN of force is gener - ated per fi lament ( the elastic Brownian ratchet model predicts (cid:3) 2 – 7 pN per fi lament ; Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) , there must be (cid:3) 100 active fi laments impinging on 1 μ m of the leading edge .

JCB • VOLUME 174 • NUMBER 6 • 2006 770 For comparison , V . Small estimates (cid:3) 120 fi laments per mi - crometer from electron micrographs of the trout keratocyte leading edge ( Small , V . , personal communication ) . Abraham et al . ( 1999 ) have estimated the number of actin fi laments in the fi broblast lamellipod to be (cid:3) 240 in a frontal area of 176 nm × 1 μ m . If we assume that the area in contact with the cantilever is (cid:3) 200 nm × 3 μ m , effective pressures caused by the actin polymerization at stall can be calculated . For keratocytes , the lamellipodial pressure is (cid:3) 2 nN / μ m 2 ( 2 kPa ) , whereas for fi bro - blasts , it is (cid:3) 10 nN / μ m 2 ( 10 kPa ; Abraham et al . , 1999 ) . In compa - rison , the measured polymerization pressure for an actin comet tail modeling that in Listeria monocytogenes is (cid:3) 1 nN / μ m 2 ( 1 kPa ; Marcy et al . , 2004 ; Parekh et al . , 2005 ) . Fig . 5 a shows force - velocity relationships normalized by the unloaded velocity and the stall force . ( Note that the ini - tial sharp drop of velocity at forces of the order of ≤ 100 pN is not depicted ) . They indicate that at low force , the velocity is insensitive to the load , whereas at high loads , the velocity of the lamellipod decreases sharply similar in form to the recent measurement for in vitro L . monocytogenes – like actin networks ( Parekh et al . , 2005 ) . The initial force - insensitive region is not caused by a geometric effect of a fl at cantilever hitting a curved leading edge ( the estimate in supplemental material shows that it would take only a second or so for the part of the cell not initially tangent to the cantilever to hit it , whereas the fl at part of the force - velocity curve persists for 5 – 8 s ; available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200601159 / DC1 ) . Interestingly , the force - velocity relation we measured conforms neither to recent theoretical models ( Fig . 5 b ) nor to a previously measured force - velocity relation of actin comet tails . Marcy et al . ( 2004 ) and McGrath et al . ( 2003 ) obtained a con - vex ( bending up ) force - velocity relation in which the velocity decreases rapidly at low loads and slowly decreases at a greater force , which is in sharp contrast to our measurement . Only Parekh et al . ( 2005 ) observed a concave ( bending down ) force - velocity relation ; however , in contrast with our data , their veloc - ity increased before it became insensitive to the load , possibly as a result of transient actin growth effects . The elastic polym - erization ratchet ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 , 2003 ) as well as the elastic propulsion theory ( Marcy et al . , 2004 ) also predicts a convex force - velocity relation . The theory of autocatalytic branching ( Carlsson , 2003 ) predicts a constant protrusion rate that is completely insensitive to force ( Fig . 5 ) because greater load indirectly increases the Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching and ef - fective density increase of the actin network . Curiously , in vitro , such a force - velocity relation was measured for a bead undergo - ing actin - based motility in a purifi ed protein system ( Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) , albeit for small forces that we cannot probe . The fi lament end – tracking motor model ( Dickinson et al . , 2004 ) as - sumes the existence of a motorlike molecular complex at the fi lamentous actin barbed end and predicts a few possible force - velocity relations , one of which is concave ( bending down ; Fig . 5 ) . None of the existing theories predicts the observed com - plex three - phase force - velocity relation : a sharp drop of veloc - ity at a very small load , a region where velocity is insensitive to low loads , and an abrupt decrease of velocity at large loads and subsequent stall . There are several theoretical possibilities that could ex - plain the observed force - velocity relation . The initial sharp drop of velocity at very small forces of tens of piconewtons per mi - crometer can be explained in the following ways : ( 1 ) weak ad - hesions at the leading edge that limit the polymerization rate and either slide ( Jurado et al . , 2005 ) or stop to assemble ( Bohnet et al . , 2006 ) at very small loads ; ( 2 ) small osmotic / hydrostatic pressure at the leading edge ( Charras et al . , 2005 ) ; or ( 3 ) ther - mal membrane undulations that can be dampened by small loads ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) . In principle , the fi rst sharp drop of velocity could be explained by rapid recoil of the softer lamellipodial network when it encounters the stiffer cantilever . If this is the case , this part of the force - velocity relation is not a feature of the lamellipodial network but rather is a result of the measurement technique . These possibilities are discussed in detail in the supplemental material . Figure 4 . Lamellipod slowdown occurs within 250 nm of the cantilever .

PROTRUSION FORCES OF MIGRATING CELLS • PRASS ET AL . 771 The insensitivity of the velocity to low loads and its sharp drop at a greater load can be the result of a few possibilities . ( 1 ) This could be the result of two sequential processes , one of which is force independent ( for example , the chemical reac - tions associated with adhesion ) . In that case , at small loads , the force - limited process is much faster than the force - independent process , and the average duration of the step of protrusion is force independent . However , at a greater load , the force - limited process becomes slower than the force - independent one , and the average duration of the step of protrusion increases with the load . Several molecular motors ( for example , RNA polymerase [ Wang et al . , 1998 ] and kinesin [ Schnitzer et al . , 2000 ] ) and possibly myosin VI ( Iwaki et al . , 2006 ) have such force - velocity relations for this reason . ( 2 ) Another possibility is that a strong local osmotic / hydrostatic pressure ( Charras et al . , 2005 ) or gel swelling pressure ( Herant et al . , 2003 ) is the force - generating mechanism at the leading edge , in which case the velocity would not depend on the load until the pressure at the leading edge is overcome , and then actin polymerization is rapidly stalled , leading to a concave force - velocity relation . ( 3 ) Yet another possibility is the force - dependent reinforcement of the den - dritic actin network by accelerated branching ( Carlsson , 2003 ) . ( 4 ) Finally , the elastic ratchet model can explain the concave force - velocity curve if actin fi laments at the leading edge are short and rigid ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) . To summarize , the stall force we measure agrees well with the elastic polymer - ization ratchet model , but the measured convex force - velocity relation poses a challenge to models of protrusion . In vivo , the force - velocity curve , which was measured with an AFM cantilever as described above , results from an in - terdependent composite of multiple , possibly redundant mecha - nisms and limiting factors , including actin polymerization , local osmotic pressure , molecular motors , adhesion , and viscoelastic coupling to regions proximate to the cantilever , rather than a single process such as actin polymerization that can be isolated in in vitro systems ( Marcy et al . , 2004 ; Parekh et al . , 2005 ) . ( This interdependence of factors can be seen by the fact that a weak shear fl ow of only (cid:3) 0 . 01 nN / μ m acting on the leading edge of keratocytes , which is much less than what we measure as a stall force , can stop protrusion by probably interfering with nascent adhesions [ Bohnet et al . , 2006 ] ) . Also , in vivo , mechan - ical contact can trigger local mechanochemical pathways that generate signals , causing the delocalization of polymerization - maintaining complexes . Nevertheless , our results provide the fi rst direct measurements of lamellipodial protrusion force char - acteristics of a crawling cell and , therefore , represent a mechan - ical benchmark against which the adequacy of our theoretical understanding of protrusion can be judged . Materials and methods Cell culture and reagents Fish keratocytes were cultured from the scales of rainbow trout ( Oncorhyn - chus mykiss ) . The scales were removed from the freshly killed ﬁ sh and trans - ferred into 100 ml of start medium ( 17 . 5 ml RPMI 1640 without phenol red , 14 ml Fish Ringers [ 0 . 22 mM NaCl , 4 mM KCl , 4 . 8 mM NaHCO 3 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 2 mM Tris ] , 4 ml FCS , 1 . 2 ml penicillin / streptomycin , 1 ml of 1 M Hepes , and 1 ml Steinberg medium [ 0 . 52 M NaCl , 3 mM Ca ( NO 3 ) 2 , 6 mM KCl , and 8 . 6 mM MgSO 4 ] ) and washed several times . The scales were then sandwiched between two microscope slides ( Menzel - Gläser ) with 200 μ l of the start medium and left overnight at 4 ° C . Clusters of cells grew out from the scales , and these were dissociated by treating with EDTA / trypsin for 30 s and washing with 100 ml of running medium ( 20 ml Fish Ringers , 1 ml Steinberg medium , and 1 ml of 1 M Hepes ) . Single cells began to migrate after (cid:3) 5 min . All chemicals were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich or Biochrom . Experiments were usually performed within a few minutes after cells started to migrate . Cells were kept at 4 ° C until they were transferred to the optical microscopes , which were at room temperature . Force measurement microscopy A 200 × 200 × 20 - μ m piezostage ( Physik Instrumente ) was integrated into a thick aluminum plate that replaced the stage on an optical microscope ( Axiovert 135 TV ; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) such that a microscope slide with cells could be micropositioned in x , y , and z ( Fig . S1 , avail - able at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200601159 / DC1 ) . A second thick aluminum plate was placed on top of the Axiovert stage and supported by three adjustable points . An AFM cantilever ( microlever obtained from Veeco Instruments ) was mounted on a plexiglass holder and inserted in a recess of the second aluminum plate so that the cantilever was oriented perpendicular to the substrate ( Fig . 1 a ) . The spring constant of the cantilevers was measured according to the thermal noise method ( Butt and Jaschke , 1995 ) and was found to be in the range of 7 mN / m . To adjust the distance between the cantilever and microscope slide , the slide was oscillated in the y direction by driving the piezo with a sine function , and the cantilver was lowered so that it was in contact with the slide . Then the cantilever was retracted until its oscillation disappeared . To compensate for potential drift , we retracted the cantilever further by 80 – 100 nm . This pro - cedure was applied just before each measurement . Cells were positioned in front of the cantilever , and its deﬂ ection after cell contact was recorded with a CCD camera ( 4912 - 5100 / 0000 ; Cohu ) and a videocassette re - corder ( TL300 ; Panasonic ) . RICM RICM was performed on the same Axiovert 135 TV optical microscope as the force measurement and with the same setup for holding the cantilever . A mercury lamp ( HBO 50 ; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) , an antiﬂ ex slider , and a 63 × antiﬂ ex objective together with standard oil immer - sion objectives ( n = 1 . 518 ; all components were purchased from Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) were used . Cells were prepared on coverslips ( Omnilab ) . The coverslips were attached with magnets to a stainless steel holder to allow free access from the top . In this series of experiments , un - coated cantilevers ( MLCT - NONM ; Veeco Instruments ) were brought in con - tact with the glass slide and served as ﬁ xed obstacles . A green bandpass ﬁ lter ( D535 / 40 ; Chroma Technology Corp . ) was used to avoid damage of the cells by UV light and to enhance contrast in the RICM image . The sequences were recorded with a 12 - bit CCD camera ( Retiga 4000R FAST Mono ; QImaging ) and transferred directly to a computer ( MacIntosh G4 ; Apple ) via ﬁ re wire . Fluorescence and AFM The cells were prepared for ﬂ uorescence as described previously ( Lee and Jacobson , 1997 ) . In brief , (cid:3) 500 μ l of a mixture of 1 . 5 ml PBS , 0 . 5 ml of 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , 100 μ l of 50 % glutaraldehyde in water , and ≤ 100 μ l of 100 μ g / ml rhodamine - phalloidin in MeOH was introduced shortly after the lamellipod struck the cantilever . After (cid:3) 1 min of incubation with the ﬁ xation and staining mixture , cells were washed several times in PBS and imaged later with an Axiovert 135 TV microscope . Images were recorded with a Visicam ( Visitron Systems ) using CamWare 1 . 26 ( PCO AG ) and a PC operated with Windows 2000 SP4 ( Microsoft ) . Contact - mode AFM on ﬁ xed and stained cells was performed on a microscope ( MFP3D ; Asylum Research ) . Data acquisition and analysis Force measurements were performed as follows : the recorded video frames were digitized with a frame grabber card ( AG - 5 ; Scion Corp . ) us - ing ImageJ 1 . 33u software ( National Institutes of Health ) . The time period of interest ( deﬂ ection of the cantilever by the lamellipod ) was recorded in 768 × 512 - pixel images at 25 frames / s . For each image , we aver - aged ﬁ ve neighboring horizontal lines , which were perpendicular to the cantilever . Because the cantilever is the brightest object in this line , the position of the edge could be deﬁ ned by looking at a certain gray value . By following this position , we were able to determine the deﬂ ection as a function of time . Calibration was performed with a stage micrometer ( 100 lines per millimeter ; Leitz ) to generate deﬂ ection versus time graphs . JCB • VOLUME 174 • NUMBER 6 • 2006 772 These data sets contained a signiﬁ cant amount of noise and were smoothed by using a spline ﬁ t option of IGOR Pro ( WaveMetrics ) . The smoothing fac - tor was set to one , and the SD was varied to obtain the best ﬁ t . To produce force - velocity curves , the velocity of the tip was obtained by differentiating the smoothed position versus time curve , whereas the force was calculated from Hooke’s Law . Velocity versus force curves were normalized by the initial velocity of the cantilever ( v max ) and by the force at the point where v = v max / 2 ( f 1 / 2 ) . Error bars for the force were calculated by using the SD of the deﬂ ection . Errors in velocity were not calculated because the position versus time data had to be smoothed before taking the derivative . For AFM , height proﬁ les were obtained after ﬂ attening height im - ages with a second order ﬂ atten option , which is available in the IGOR software . The recording and analysis were performed with IGOR Pro . For RICM , the images were recorded with a 512 × 512 - pixel array and an exposure time of 1 s . The position of the adhesions at the front of the lamel - lipod , as detected by RICM , were recorded from (cid:3) 30 s before cantilever contact to the last visible position of the leading edge ( as a result of the high reﬂ ection of the cantilever ) . Using IGOR Pro , kymographs were con - structed from the time series of images ( Fig . 4 , b and c ) by extracting lines from the videos that capture the collision of the leading edge with the canti - lever ; spatial differentiation of such lines gave sharper edge detection . Calibration was performed with a stage micrometer .
