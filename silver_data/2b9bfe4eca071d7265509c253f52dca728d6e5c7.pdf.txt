Edu Quantitative measurements of diffusion can provide important information about how proteins and lipids interact with their environment within the cell and the effective size of the diffusing species . Confocal ﬂuores - cence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) is one of the most widely accessible approaches to measure protein and lipid diffusion in living cells . However , straightfor - ward approaches to quantify confocal FRAP measure - ments in terms of absolute diffusion coefﬁcients are cur - rently lacking . Here , we report a simpliﬁed equation that can be used to extract diffusion coefﬁcients from confocal FRAP data using the half time of recovery and effective bleach radius for a circular bleach region , and validate this equation for a series of ﬂuorescently labeled soluble and membrane - bound proteins and lipids . We show that using this approach , diffusion coefﬁcients ranging over three orders of magnitude can be obtained from confocal FRAP measurements performed under standard imaging conditions , highlighting its broad applicability . Key words : confocal laser scanning microscope , diffusion coefﬁcient , ﬂuorescence microscopy , FRAP , half time of recovery Received 31 May 2012 , revised and accepted for publication 9 September 2012 , uncorrected manuscript published online 17 September 2012 , published online 10 October 2012 Diffusion is a fundamental process that is relevant over all scales of biology . How rapidly diffusion occurs is charac - terized by the diffusion coefﬁcient D , a parameter that provides a measure of the mean squared displacement per unit time of the diffusing species . At the cellular level , measurements of D can provide important insights into how proteins and lipids interact with their environment , such as the binding of transcription factors with DNA and of proteins and lipids with membrane domains ( 1 , 2 ) . In addition , especially for the case of soluble proteins , an accurate measure of Dcan provide important information about the effective size of the diffusing species ( 3 ) . Currently , biologists have at their disposal a wide range of ﬂuorescence - based techniques to monitor the diffusion of biomolecules in cells , including single - particle tracking ( SPT ) , ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) , photoactivation and ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) ( 4 ) . Of these approaches , many require specialized equipment , analytical tools or probes . In contrast , confocal FRAP is one of the most accessible methods to measure apparent diffusion ( or effective diffusion ) . In FRAP , the diffusion of a population of ﬂuorescently labeled molecules can be studied by photobleaching the molecules contained within a user - deﬁned region of interest ( ROI ) , and then monitoring ﬂuorescence recovery due to the exchange of bleached molecules within the bleach ROI with the surrounding reservoir of unbleached molecules . Most modern confocal laser scanning microscopes ( CLSMs ) are equipped to perform FRAP measurements , and FRAP measurements are straightforward to carry out . In addition , FRAP can be performed using many ﬂuorescently tagged proteins or on directly ﬂuorescently labeled molecules ( 4 , 5 ) . Despite the relative ease of performing confocal FRAP measurements , straightforward methods to quantitatively analyze the resulting data are currently lacking . Most current approaches to calculate Ds from confocal FRAP data require ﬁtting of recovery curves with analytical diffusion models using customized programs , a process which often demands a signiﬁcant level of knowledge of FRAP theory ( Table 1 ) . Alternatively , FRAP measurements can be quantiﬁed simply in terms of the half time of recovery ( τ 1 / 2 ) , deﬁned as the time required for a bleach spot to recover half way between initial and steady - state ﬂuorescence intensities ( 16 – 19 ) . An advantage of this approach is that τ 1 / 2 can be readily extracted from FRAP recovery curves ( 16 – 19 ) . However , τ 1 / 2 is strongly dependent on experimental parameters such as the nominal radius of the user - deﬁned bleach spot ( r n ) and the exact bleaching protocol , as well as the characteristic dynamics of the molecule under investigation . Therefore , τ 1 / 2 is an empirical parameter that www . trafﬁc . dk 1589 Kang et al .

In contrast , D provides a quantitative measure of diffusion ( 6 , 7 ) . Knowledge of the absolute magnitude of D has many advantages over measurements of τ 1 / 2 . For example , D is uniquely determined by the size of the diffusing molecule as well as its local environment ( 20 ) . Therefore , discrepancies between the theoretically expected D and measured apparent ( or effective ) diffusion coefﬁcients may indicate possible molecular interactions or more complex situations . For example , in cell membranes the presence of microdomains prevents proteins from undergoing free diffusion ( 2 ) . Accurate estimates of D are also a necessary starting point for reaction – diffusion analysis ( 1 , 21 ) . One potential solution to the problem of extracting quantitative Dvalues from confocal FRAP data is to utilize the explicit forms of the classical two - dimensional ( 2D ) FRAP equations for small circular bleaching spots derived by Axelrod for a Gaussian laser ( 6 ) and by Soumpasis for a uniform laser ( 7 ) . Both Axelrod and Soumpasis ( 6 , 7 ) reported equations that relate D , τ 1 / 2 and r n for a pure isotropic diffusion model . For example , the Soumpasis equation is given by D r n = 0 . 224 r 2n τ 1 / 2 ( 1 ) where r n is the radius of the uniform bleach laser and the coefﬁcient 0 . 224 was numerically determined ( 7 ) . However , the derivation of both the Axelrod and Soumpasis FRAP equations assumed that diffusion during photobleaching is negligible . This is not necessarily the case for confocal FRAP . Due to the long scanning time of CLSMs ( approximate seconds ) , signiﬁcant diffusion during the photobleaching may occur in confocal FRAP . r n thus may not provide an accurate description of the initial conditions required for this equation to be valid . Failure to take this into account can lead to underestimation of D when the Soumpasis or Axelrod equations are used to analyze confocal FRAP data , especially for fast - diffusing soluble proteins ( 8 , 9 , 22 , 23 ) . This discrepancy can be resolved using a modiﬁed form of the conventional FRAP equations by using the postbleach ﬂuorescence intensity proﬁle to correct for any diffusion that occurs during the photobleaching by incorporating an empirically determined measure , the effective bleach radius r e from the postbleach proﬁle ( 9 ) . However , this approach also requires full ﬁtting of the FRAP recovery curves to calculate D . In this study , we sought to further simplify this approach by deriving an equation to calculate Dfrom confocal FRAP data obtained using circular bleach regions . Theory All the parameters and their meanings are summarized in Table 2 . For simplicity , we assume that cells are ﬂat enough ( as in the case of COS7 cells ) so that both the plasma membrane as well as the cytosol can be treated as 2D objects . We also assume that bleaching spot size is small compared with the cell size , so that we can treat the cell as an inﬁnite plane . Having these , laser intensity proﬁles for photobleaching lasers in the inﬁnite plane are described as either a Gaussian laser : I r n ( x , y ) = 2I 0 π r 2n exp (cid:2) − 2 (cid:3) x 2 + y 2 (cid:4) r 2n (cid:5) 1590 Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 1589 – 1600 Simpliﬁed Confocal FRAP Analysis Table 2 : List of parameters and their deﬁnitions Parameter Meaning Parameter Meaning D Diffusion coefﬁcient F i Prebleach ﬂuorescence intensity τ 1 / 2 Half time of recovery F 0 Initial postbleach ﬂuorescence intensity r n Nominal radius = bleaching spot radius = sampling region radius F ∞ Postbleach steady - state ﬂuorescence intensity r e Effective radius = spreading radius of postbleach proﬁle F 1 / 2 Fluorescence intensity at the half of recovery = [ F 0 + F ∞ ] / 2 q Quantum yield M f Mobile fraction = [ F ∞ − F 0 ] / [ F i − F 0 ] ∈ Attenuation factor for excitation laser τ D Diffusion time = r 2e / ( 4D ) K Bleaching depth parameter D r n Dfrom Soumpasis equation using r n (cid:6) D r n = 0 . 224 r 2n τ 1 / 2 (cid:7) γ The ratio of the nominal and effective radius = r n / r e D r e Dfrom Soumpasis equation using r e (cid:6) D r e = 0 . 224 r 2e τ 1 / 2 (cid:7) C i Prebleach ﬂuorescent protein concentration D Confocal Dfrom = r n / r e and τ 1 / 2 (cid:6) D Confocal = r 2e + r 2n 8 τ 1 / 2 (cid:7) n Number of independent experiments N Total number of cells for FRAP data collection or a uniform laser , I r n ( x , y ) = I 0 π r 2n H (cid:8) r 2n − x 2 − y 2 (cid:9) where H ( · ) is the Heaviside function . In both cases , r n is deﬁned as a nominal radius , and the excitation lasers are represented as ε I r n ( x , y ) for attenuation factor ε ( (cid:4) 1 ) . If we assume the concentration of ﬂuorescent proteins C ( x , y , t ) satisﬁes the diffusion equation C t = D (cid:2) C where D ( μ m 2 / s ) is a diffusion coefﬁcient and (cid:2) = ( ∂ 2 / ∂ x 2 ) + ( ∂ 2 / ∂ y 2 ) , then the solution can be com - puted from a convolution of the fundamental solution of the diffusion equation and an initial condition as C ( x , y , t ) = (cid:10) (cid:10) C (cid:3) x − x (cid:5) , y − y (cid:5) , 0 (cid:4) (cid:4) Dt (cid:3) x (cid:5) , y (cid:5) (cid:4) dx (cid:5) dy (cid:5) where the fundamental solution of the diffusion equation in the inﬁnite plane is deﬁned as (cid:4) Dt ( x , y ) = 1 4 π Dt exp (cid:6) − x 2 + y 2 4Dt (cid:7) . Therefore , the ﬂuorescence intensity from the bleach ROI can be computed ( 6 , 9 ) from F ( t ) = q (cid:10) (cid:10) ε I r n ( x , y ) C ( x , y , t ) dxdy where q is the quantum yield of the ﬂuorophores and C ( x , y , t ) describes the concentration of ﬂuorescent proteins within the confocal volume at time t . It has been empirically shown that a confocal postbleach proﬁle can be described as a simple Gaussian function ( constant minus Gaussian ) ( 21 ) ; C ( x , y , 0 ) = C i (cid:2) 1 − Kexp (cid:2) − 2 (cid:3) x 2 + y 2 (cid:4) r 2e (cid:5)(cid:5) , ( 2 ) where C i is the prebleach ﬂuorescent protein concentra - tion , and r e is the half width at the approximately 14 % of bleaching depth from the top . We deﬁne r e as the effective radius of a postbleach proﬁle , in contrast to the nominal radius ( r n ) from a user - deﬁned bleaching spot radius . Following the computation in Axelrod et al . ( 6 , 9 ) , for a solution of the diffusion equation with unknown diffusion coefﬁcient D and an initial condition given by eqn ( 2 ) , a diffusion FRAP equation for confocal FRAP can be found as F ( t ) = F i (cid:11) 1 − K 1 + γ 2 + 2t / τ D (cid:12) M f + ( 1 − M f ) F 0 ( 3 ) where τ D = r 2e / ( 4D ) and γ = r n / r e . M f is deﬁned as M f = F ∞ − F 0 F i − F 0 for prebleach ﬂuorescence intensity ( F i ) , postbleach initial ﬂuorescence intensity ( F 0 ) and postbleach steady - state ﬂuorescence intensity ( F ∞ ) . K can be computed from eqn ( 3 ) at t = 0 ( i . e . F ( 0 ) = F 0 ) , F 0 = F i (cid:11) 1 − K 1 + γ 2 (cid:12) ⇒ K = ( F i − F 0 ) F i ( 1 + γ 2 ) . ( 4 ) If we let F 1 / 2 = F 0 + F ∞ 2 , i . e . the ﬂuorescence intensity at the half time of recovery then , by deﬁnition , F ( τ 1 / 2 ) = F 1 / 2 . As F 1 / 2 can be related to M f by F 1 / 2 = ( F i − F 0 ) 2 M f + F 0 , Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 1589 – 1600 1591 Kang et al . by setting F ( τ 1 / 2 ) = F 1 / 2 : F 1 / 2 = F i (cid:11) 1 − K 1 + γ 2 + 2 τ 1 / 2 / τ D (cid:12) M f + ( 1 − M f ) F 0 ⇒ 1 + γ 2 + 2 τ 1 / 2 τ D = K 1 − ( F i + F 0 ) 2F i ; ⇒ 1 + γ 2 + 2 τ 1 / 2 τ D = ( F i − F 0 ) F i (cid:3) 1 + γ 2 (cid:4) 1 − ( F i + F 0 ) 2F i , where we applied the deﬁnition of K in eqn ( 4 ) . By multiplying 2F i to both the denominator and numerator in the right hand side , we obtain 1 + γ 2 + 2 τ 1 / 2 τ D = 2 ( F i − F 0 ) (cid:3) 1 + γ 2 (cid:4) F i − F 0 1 + γ 2 + 2 τ 1 / 2 τ D = 2 (cid:8) 1 + γ 2 (cid:9) ; 2 τ 1 / 2 τ D = (cid:8) 1 + γ 2 (cid:9) . Finally , by solving for D in τ D = r 2e / ( 4D ) , after applying γ = r n / r e , we have D Confocal = r 2e + r 2n 8 τ 1 / 2 . ( 5 ) When r e = r n in eqn ( 4 ) ( i . e . bleaching is instantaneous ) , we obtainD = 0 . 25 r 2n τ 1 / 2 which is essentially identical to the Soumpasis equation ( 1 ) . The approximately 3 % difference in the proportionality constants in eqns ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) is due to the different assumptions on either Gaussian or uniform laser proﬁles . Results and Discussion To validate our new FRAP equations ( eqns ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) ) , we used them to extract D values from confocal FRAP data obtained using a CLSM under standard imaging conditions for a series of proteins and lipid probes localized either to the plasma membrane , or within the cytosol ( Figure 1 ) . The proteins and lipid probes studied included Alexa488 - conjugated cholera toxin B - subunit ( Alexa - CTxB ) , a glycolipid - binding bacterial toxin commonly studied as a marker of lipid rafts ; a model GPI - anchored protein ( YFP - GL - GPI ) ; a ﬂuorescent lipid analog ( DiIC 16 ) ; and soluble EGFP ( Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein ) in the cytosol ( EGFP ) . Additionally , the protein Flotillin - 1 , which is diffusely distributed across the cell surface when overexpressed ( 24 ) was examined . Previously reported diffusion coefﬁcients for these molecules span over three orders of magnitude ( Table 3 ) , covering a range ofDvalues that are physiologically relevant for most studies of protein and lipid dynamics in cells . We performed confocal FRAP analysis of each of these molecules using a circular bleach region with a nominal Table 3 : Diffusion coefﬁcients in cells previously reported in the literature for the molecules examined in the current study by confocal FRAP Marker D ( μ m 2 / second ) Methods References CTxB 0 . 15 – 0 . 4 FRAP , FCS ( 5 , 25 , 26 ) YFP - GL - GPI 0 . 2 – 1 . 3 FRAP , SPT ( 5 , 26 , 27 ) DiIC 16 0 . 9 – 5 FRAP , FCS , SPT ( 5 , 26 , 28 , 29 ) EGFP 20 – 70 FRAP , FCS ( 21 , 30 , 31 ) bleach radius ( r n ) of 1 . 1 μ m by repetitively scanning the bleach region . We veriﬁed that when diffusion was inhibited by ﬁxing the sample prior to bleaching that the radius of the bleach region was similar to the user - deﬁned nominal bleach radius ( Figure 2 ) . Next , we calculated the effective bleach radius ( r e ) and bleach depth ( K ) from the postbleach ﬂuorescence proﬁle ( Figure 3A , B ) . For slowly diffusing molecules such as CTxB , the effective bleach radius calculated from the postbleach proﬁle was only slightly larger than the nominal bleach radius ( Figure 2 ) . However , for the majority of molecules examined exchange of ﬂuorescently tagged proteins outside of bleach region was evident . This effect was especially pronounced for the fastest diffusing molecules ( Figure 3A , B ) . Importantly , the postbleach proﬁles were well described by an exponential function for all of the molecules examined . This indicates that this approximation provides a reasonable description of the data even for molecules with widely ranging diffusional mobilities and thus our FRAP equations are valid under these conditions . We next interpolated the recovery curves to obtain τ 1 / 2 ( Figure 3C , Table 4 ) , and computed Deither by ﬁtting the FRAP data with eqn ( 3 ) ( Figure 3C ) or by plugging these numbers directly into the simpliﬁed D Confocal equation ( eqn ( 5 ) ) . As illustrated in Figure 4 , essentially identical D values were obtained using eqn ( 3 ) ( D Fitting ) and eqn ( 5 ) ( D Confocal ) ( Student’s t - test , p > 0 . 05 ) showing that the two approaches yield similar results as expected . In addition , the Dvalues obtained in this way were in good agreement with the range of values previous reported from studies using more elaborate approaches to quantify D ( Table 3 ) . Moreover , the estimated Ds obtained using D Confocal and D Fitting are independent of experimental conditions as assessed by comparing measurements of EGFP diffusion in the cytoplasm using different bleaching spot size and photobleaching times ( Figure 5 and Table 5 ( 9 ) , Student’s t - test , p > 0 . 05 ) . To illustrate the importance of using the corrected values of bleach radius to calculate D values , the same FRAP data were analyzed by Soumpasis equation ( 1 ) using either r n ( D r n ) or r e ( D r e ) . This approach yielded Ds that were signiﬁcantly different from those measured using eqn ( 3 ) or ( 5 ) ( Figure 4 , Student’s t - test , p < 0 . 05 ) . The relation between D Confocal and D r n can be easily seen from 1592 Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 1589 – 1600 Simpliﬁed Confocal FRAP Analysis A B D E C Figure 1 : Representative images of the subcellular distribution of the proteins and lipids studied .

( 7 ) Therefore , D r n and D r e can be understood as the upper and lower bounds for D . Importantly , eqns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) provide the analytic relations between the equations that relate D and τ 1 / 2 for conventional and confocal FRAP in terms of γ , the ratio r n / r e . This relationship also indicates that τ 1 / 2 will not scale proportionally withDunder conditions where r e > r n , providing further evidence that τ 1 / 2 is not a good approximator of diffusional mobility . For example , depending on the exact imaging conditions used , molecules with similar values of D can show different values of τ 1 / 2 ( compare results for YFP - GL - GPI and RFP - Flot in Table 4 ) . The non - ﬁtting method using eqn ( 5 ) heavily hinges on obtaining accurate measurements of r e and τ 1 / 2 , which can be achieved by analysis of large amount of FRAP Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 1589 – 1600 1593 Kang et al .

Working with averaged FRAP data is more advantageous than using the mean value arising from individual measurements from a computational cost perspective , especially for noisy data from a small ROI size ( r n ) or fast diffusion . We also carefully compared D and M f obtained from individual FRAP data with the values from the averaged FRAP curve 1594 Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 1589 – 1600 Simpliﬁed Confocal FRAP Analysis A B C Figure 3 : Confocal FRAP data of Alexa - CTxB , YFP - GL - GPI , Flot - 1 - RFP , DiIC 16 and EGFP .

In ( B ) and ( C ) , y - axes are normalized ﬂuorescence intensities , i . e . F i = 1 . Since the bleach ROI is slightly off center in our system , a correction was made to determine r e as described in the MaterialsandMethods . for a set of experiments to check if the normalization of the FRAP curves incidently masks biological variability , such as expression level - dependent diffusion coefﬁcients ( 32 ) . However , for the proteins and lipids examined here , D and M f obtained from individual FRAP data did not show any signiﬁcant differences from those obtained from the averaged FRAP curves ( Figure 6 , Student’s t - test , p > 0 . 05 ) . In a previous study , we found that r e varies with both r n and bleaching time , and is more sensitive to r n than the bleaching time . For larger r n and longer bleaching time , a larger r e is obtained ( 9 , 21 ) . In addition , the sensitivity of r e to experimental deﬁnition of r n and bleaching time is higher for rapidly diffusing proteins ( 9 , 21 ) . Nevertheless , variations of r e and τ 1 / 2 are constrained by the relation given by eqn ( 5 ) for large range of K as long as the post bleach proﬁles can be described by a Gaussian ( eqn ( 2 ) ) . In summary , we derived and tested a new , simpliﬁed equation for the quantitative analysis of confocal FRAP data based on the pure isotropic diffusion model . An overall workﬂow to determine the apparent diffusion coefﬁcient , D from τ 1 / 2 , r n and r e is summarized in Figure 7 . Taking advantage of widely available technology , this new approach should be accessible to many biologists , since most researchers already have access to CLSMs . Importantly , this method does not require generation of new constructs or the use of specialized ﬂuorescent dyes or labels , and can be applied to both Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 1589 – 1600 1595 Kang et al . Figure 4 : Comparison of diffusion coefﬁcients determined by various schemes . Comparison of diffusion coefﬁcients determined by FRAP data ﬁtting ( D Fitting , eqn ( 3 ) ) , versus the D Confocal equation ( eqn ( 5 ) ) , or the Soumpasis equation using either r n ( D r n ) or r e ( D r e ) in log scale . Ds were found from averaged FRAP curves ( N ≥ 12 cells per experiment ) for three or more separate experiments ( n ≥ 3 ) . Error bars represent standard errors .

Finally , it should be possible to readily incorporate this method into automated approaches to perform and analyze FRAP ( 33 ) , and thus provide quantitative values for use in systems biology . Materials and Methods Celllabelingandreagents COS - 7 cells were acquired from ATCC ( Manassas ) . Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were plated on coverslips 2 days prior to experiments . Cells were transfected 1 day prior to imaging with the model GPI - anchored protein ( YFP - GL - GPI ) ( 5 ) , Flotillin - 1 - RFP ( Flot - 1 - RFP , the gift of Dr Ai Yamamoto , Columbia University ) ( 34 ) or EGFP ( Clontech ) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent ( Roche Diagnostics ) . DiIC 16 ( 1 , 1 (cid:5) - dihexadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 (cid:5) , 3 (cid:5) - tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ) and Alexa488 ﬂuorophore - conjugated cholera toxin B - subunit from Vibrio choleraewere obtained from Invitrogen . For exogenous labeling the cells were rinsed twice with media and then incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 100 n M Alexa488 - CTxB or 5 μ g / mL DiIC 16 . Cells were then rinsed twice with media and imaged . Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 1 mg / mL Bovine Serum Albumin and 25 m M HEPES buffer during imaging . For FRAP on ﬁxed samples , cell were labeled live withAlexa488 - CTxB ( asabove ) . Immediatelyafterlabeling , cellswereﬁxed with 3 . 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature . Cells were then rinsed with 1 × PBS and mounted in Fluoromount G supplemented with 25 mg / mL DABCO ( 1 , 4 diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and allowed to solidify overnight prior to imaging . FRAPmethods FRAP experiments were carried out on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging ) using ﬁlter sets provided by the manufacturer . Imaging was performed using a 40 × 1 . 3 NA Zeiss Plan - Neoﬂuar objective at 4 × digital zoom . The confocal pinhole was set Figure 5 : Comparison of diffusion coefﬁcients for EGFP in the cytosol obtained by confocal FRAP under different experimental conditions as calculated using the Soumpasis equation or D Confocal equation . Diffusion coefﬁcients were determined by FRAP data ﬁtting ( D Fitting , eqn ( 3 ) ) , by the D Confocal equation ( eqn ( 5 ) ) , by the Soumpasis equation using r n ( D r n ) , and by the Soumpasis equation using r e ( D r e ) for individual confocal FRAP curves ( N ≥ 6 ) . Dashed box indicates the range of EGFP’s diffusion coefﬁcients in the cytosol reported in the literature . r e was measured from an averaged postbleach proﬁle ( n = 1 , N = 10 cells ) and Ds were obtained from individual FRAP data ( n = 1 , N = 8 , 10 , 10 and 8 cells ) . * p < 0 . 05 compared to D Fitting , Student’s t - test . between 1 . 78 and 1 . 81 Airy units . The imaging window was further narrowed to a square observation ROI of 70 × 70 pixel ( 7 . 7 × 7 . 7 μ m ) . The 70 × 70 window contained a circular bleach ROI 20 pixels ( 2 . 2 μ m ) in diameter . FRAP conditions were optimized for each molecule under study . Samples were imaged and bleached using a 30 mW Argon laser ( 488 and 514 laser lines ) or 1 . 0 mW HeNe laser ( 543 nm laser line ) . Laser powers for prebleach and postbleach imaging were maintained between 6 . 8 and 17 . 1 nW ( 488 or 514 nm ) or between 13 . 8 and 21 . 0 nW ( 543 nm ) . Bleaching of Alexa 488 - CTxB was performed using the 488 nm line at 0 . 99 μ W . EGFP and Flot - 1 - RFP were bleached using the 488 nm line at 2 . 28 μ W , and YFP - GL - GPI was bleached using the 514 nm line at 1 . 38 μ W . To bleach DiIC 16 we combined the 488 nm line ( 40 nW ) , 514 ( 360 nW ) and 543 ( 540 nW ) . Bleaching regions were scanned 10 ( Alexa - CTxB , YFP - GL - GPI ) or 20 times ( EGFP , Flot - 1 - RFP or DiIC 16 ) . Prebleach and postbleach images were collected with either no line averaging or with line averaging of 2 . Time series images were collect using 2 seconds delay ( Alexa - CTxB ) , 0 . 25 seconds delay ( YFP - GL - GPI ) or no delay ( Flot - 1 - RFP , DiIC 16 , EGFP ) . This resulted in bleach times of 1 . 12 seconds ( Alexa - CTxB ) , 0 . 69 seconds ( YFP - GL - GPI ) , 0 . 56 seconds ( Flot - 1 - RFP ) , 0 . 49 seconds ( DiIC 16 ) and 0 . 27 seconds ( EGFP ) . During recovery , images were collected every 2 . 27 seconds ( Alexa - CTxB ) , 0 . 52 seconds ( YFP - GL - GPI ) , 0 . 14 seconds ( Flot - 1 - RFP ) , 0 . 068 seconds ( DiIC 16 ) or 0 . 035 seconds ( EGFP ) . All FRAP was performed at 37 ◦ C using a stage heater . Correctionforbackgroundandphotofading To correct for background ( F bk ) , ﬂuorescence from a cell - free area of the coverslip was measured under the same conditions as FRAP was performed . To correct for observational photofading ( F Fading ( t ) ) , a time series was collected as for the FRAP studies , except no photobleaching step was performed . The raw FRAP data , F Raw ( t ) , were corrected for 1596 Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 1589 – 1600 Simpliﬁed Confocal FRAP Analysis A B C D Figure 6 : Comparison of values obtained from averaged FRAP data versus mean of values from individual FRAP data .

Finally , the corrected data were normalized by the prebleach intensity , F iCorrected as F ( t ) = F Corrected ( t ) F iCorrected . τ 1 / 2 measurements To measure τ 1 / 2 from the FRAP data a linear interpolation method was used . For the FRAP data { F ( 0 ) , F ( t 1 ) , F ( t 2 ) , ··· , F ( t n ) } such that F ( 0 ) = F 0 andF ( t n ) = F ∞ , the ﬂuorescence intensity at half of recovery is deﬁned as F 1 / 2 = ( F 0 + F ∞ ) / 2 . If F ( t k ) = F 1 / 2 for some t k then we chose τ 1 / 2 = t k . If F ( t k ) < F 1 / 2 < F ( t k + 1 ) then we chose τ 1 / 2 = t k + (cid:13) F 1 / 2 − F (cid:3) t k (cid:4)(cid:14) (cid:15) F (cid:3) t k + 1 (cid:4) − F (cid:3) t k (cid:4)(cid:16) (cid:3) t k + 1 − t k (cid:4) . r e measurements In order to obtain normalized initial postbleach proﬁles , ﬂuorescence intensities were measured along a diagonal of the square observation ROIs of 70 × 70 pixel ( 7 . 7 × 7 . 7 μ m ) from the prebleach image obtained immediately prior to and after photobleaching . Between the proﬁles obtained from two diagonals , the dataset with better symmetry was chosen for analysis . The proﬁles were then normalized by dividing the postbleach proﬁle by the prebleach proﬁle . The normalized postbleach proﬁles were averaged over datasets ( N = 12 ∼ 14 ) . Since the bleach ROI was slightly off center in some cases , if necessary , the symmetry axis was found and set to be x = 0 from the normalized mean postbleach proﬁle . The mean proﬁles were then ﬁtted to f Postbleach ( x ) = 1 − Kexp (cid:2) − x 2 r 2e (cid:5) for K and r e using a nonlinear least - squares ﬁtting routine ( nlinﬁt . m ) available in MATLAB ® ( version 7 . 10 , R2010a , The Mathworks Inc . ) . Alternatively , r e can be determined by direct measurement following three steps . First , K can be determined from the bleaching depth in the normalized postbleach proﬁle as referred as in Figure 8 . Then , the half width of cross - sections between the horizontal line at the height of 0 . 86 K from the bottom of the postbleach proﬁle ( Figure 8 ) and the postbleach proﬁles yields r e without involving any ﬁtting ( Figure 8 ) .

FRAPdataﬁttingforDandM f andweightedresidual The FRAP curves were normalized by the mean prebleach ﬂuorescence intensity ( i . e . F i = 1 ) and the mean of multiple normalized FRAP datasets was used for data ﬁtting . Data ﬁtting was carried out for D and M f by a nonlinear least - squares ﬁtting routine ( nlinﬁt . m ) available in MATLAB ® ( version 7 . 10 , R2010a , The Mathworks , Inc . ) minimizing a weighted residual between averaged FRAP data from 10 experiments ( F Data ( t ) ) and a theoretical FRAP curve ( F ( t ) , eqn ( 3 ) ) , where the weighted residual is deﬁned by | | F Data ( t ) − F ( t ) | | = s (cid:10) 0 (cid:17)(cid:17) F Data ( z ) − F ( z ) (cid:17)(cid:17) z + s (cid:10) 0 F Data ( w ) dw dz . where s is the end time of FRAP data . If F ( 0 ) computed using K from postbleach proﬁle ﬁtting showed any discrepancy from F Data ( 0 ) , K was recalibrated using K = ( 1 + γ 2 ) ( 1 − F Data ( 0 ) ) before data ﬁtting .
