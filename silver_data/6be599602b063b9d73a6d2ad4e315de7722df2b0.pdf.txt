ABSTRACT Changes in the surface morphology of secreting mast cells have been followed by scanning electron microscopy . Mast cells isolated from the rat peritoneal cavity have folds of plasma membrane that form snake - like ridges on their surfaces . Fold length varies considerably from cell to cell , whereas fold width and depth appear to remain relatively constant . To assess the possible relationship between secre - tory activity and surface folding , a semiquantitative method was used for measur - ing fold length in control and secreting populations . A positive correlation is found between secretion of histamine and the extent of membrane folds on the mast cell surface . The source of the membrane required for fold formation is probably secretory granule membrane incorporated into the plasma membrane as a result of exocytosis . Furthermore , a distinct cell type devoid of surface folds , designated as a raspberry - type cell , is found to occur as an integral part of a normal population of mast cells . This cell type is resistant to stimulation by polymyxin . KEY WORDS mast cell - histamine secretion membrane folds (cid:12)9 cell surface morphology (cid:12)9 scanning electron microscopy The surface features of a cell are an expression of the cell ' s response to its internal and external environment . Cell surfaces change as a function of altered physiology , for example , during cell cycle ( 18 ) , in transformed cells ( 19 ) , in response to environmental irritants ( 17 ) , etc . The experiments reported here were undertaken to determine a possible relationship between surface features and secretory activity in the rat peritoneal mast cell . The mast cell synthesizes and stores histamine , among other secretory products , and undergoes compound exocytosis when stimulated to secrete ( 6 ) . Mast cells observed in the scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) have , as characteristic surface features , folds of plasma membrane that form curved ridges in anastomosing patterns ( 3 , 9 , 23 ) , corresponding to microvillus - like projections ob - served in thin sections ( 11 , 20 ) . The folds are also visible on freeze - fracture faces of plasma mem - brane as cross - fractured areas forming snake - like patterns ( 4 ) . Previous studies of the mast cell in SEM ( 9 , 23 ) reported the presence of these folds primarily on unstimulated cells . A cell type , de - void of folds , was also described , designated as the raspberry - type cell , which was dismissed as being an artifact of the preparation ( 9 ) . When cells were exhaustively stimulated to secrete , they lost their surface folds , developed deep cavities , and par - tially collapsed , revealing sharp contours of under - lying granules . The dosages of secretagogue and incubation times used in these previous studies were many times in excess of the conditions re - 690 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY (cid:12)9 VOLUME 74 , 1977 " pages 690 - 697 quired to obtain 100 % histamine release ( 12 ) . In the experiments reported here , intermediate stages of secretion are obtained by using milder conditions of stimulation , i . e . , lower dosage of secretagogue , shorter incubation times , and lower temperature . Histamine release is measured to assess the secretory activity of the cells . In this way , changes in the surface of secreting mast cells can be studied relative to the secretory activity of the population . Since the mast cell is essentially nonmitotic , cell cycle is not a factor in influencing its surface features . Therefore , in this case , changes in surface features probably reflect other physiological responses , the most likely of which is secretory activity . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Collection and Incubation Mast cells are collected from the peritoneal cavities of exsanguinated male rats , 150 - 180 g , of the Long - Evans strain ( U . C . Berkeley colony ) by recovering phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ( pH 7 . 2 ) pipetted into the cavities ( 20 ) . The cell suspensions , initially containing ~ 5 % mast cells , are enriched to > 70 % mast cells by using discontinuous Ficoll ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Pisca - taway , N . J . ) gradients ( 1 ) . Mast cells derived from three to eight rats are pooled and resuspended in PBS at 180C . A controlled amount of histamine secretion is obtained by adding polymyxin B sulfate ( 4 / . tg / ml of incubation mixture ) . Samples are taken 60 s after stimulation for assay of histamine release and examination in SEM . Histamine Assay Ice - cold PBS is added to each sample at the end of an incubation period to stop secretion . The samples are centrifuged ( 200 g , 4 ~ 5 min ) and histamine determi - nations are made on each supernate and pellet pair by the method of Bergendorff and Uvn ~ is ( 2 ) . Histamine is completely extracted from each pellet by boiling in 0 . 1 N HCI for 5 min . Dilutions are made with H20 . Samples of supernate containing undiluted PBS form precipitates during the assay which do not interfere with determina - tions if removed by centrifugation or filtration before reading . Histamine release is expressed as the percent - age of histamine in the supernate ( supernatant histamine plus pellet histamine equals 100 % ) . Sample Preparation for Scanning Electron Microscopy Mast cells are fixed in suspension with ice - cold 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 2 M Millonig ' s buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) and kept at room temperature for 1 h , then washed once ( Millonig ' s buffer plus 6 % sucrose ) and postfixed for 1 h in 1 % OsO4 in Millonig ' s buffer at 4 ~ The cells are kept in suspension throughout alcohol dehydration , transferral to 100 % Freon TC ( E . I . du Pont de Nem - ours & Co . , Wilmington , Del . ) , and placement in B . E . E . M . capsule chambers ( Better Equipment for Electron Microscopy , Inc . , Bronx , N . Y . ) with Flotron - ics silver membrane filters ( Selas Corp . of America , Spring House , Pa . ) ( 0 . 45 / zm pore size ) covering one end . The cells are critical - point dried in Freon 13 ( E . I . du Pont de Nemours & Co . ) . Flotronics filters give high rates of recovery for cell suspensions ( 7 ) . Surface arti - facts caused by Flotronics filters ( 25 ) are avoided by fixation of cells before contact with them ( 7 ) . Polylysine ( 14 ) is not used for attachment of cells to glass cover slips because of the possible introduction of surface artifacts ( 16 ) . Pieces of filter containing the critical - point dried cells are glued onto specimen stubs with silver paste , coated with gold under vacuum on a tilting - rotating stage , and examined in an ETEC or Coates and Welter CWlC scanning electron microscope . Micrographs are taken with Polaroid type 55 P / N film . RESULTS Mast cells observed in SEM have folds of plasma membrane that project from their surfaces . The folds form snake - like ridges in anastomosing pat - terns ( 3 , 9 , 23 ) . In between folds , contours of underlying granules are visible . No microvilli are observed ( Fig . 1 ) . Therefore , the surface projec - tions from mast cells which were previously identi - fied as microviUi in thin sections ( 11 , 20 ) corre - spond to these folds of plasma membrane viewed in cross section . The folds appear to be fairly uniform in width on the same cell and from one cell to another , averaging ~ 0 . 1 / zm . Fold depth , as viewed at the cell edge , varies to some extent , ranging from 0 . 3 to 1 . 0 / zm with 70 - 80 % of the folds - 0 . 8 / ~ m deep . Fold length is the dimension which shows the greatest variability from one cell to another . Differences in fold length are extremely apparent from cell to cell , whereas fold width and depth tend to remain fairly constant . Variability in fold length is the factor which most accounts for the heterogeneous appearance of the mast cell in SEM with respect to surface features . The cells in Fig . 1 are arranged in a sequence of increasingly folded surfaces ( increas - ing fold length ) . Some cells lack folds entirely ( the raspberry - type cell ) ( Fig . 1 A ) and the contours of underlying secretory granules are visible . Cells with extensively folded surfaces ( Fig . 1 C ) often have the extruded contents of several granules adhering to them ( arrow ) , while underlying gran - ule contours are almost totally obscured by folds .

SAriS Plasma Membrane Folds on the Mast Cell Surface 691 Furthermore , the complete range of cell surface appearances is present in both control and stimu - lated populations . The secretion of histamine by mast cells , under the conditions of stimulation used ( incubation in PBS at 18 ~ for 60 s in the presence of 4 / ~ g / ml polymyxin B sulfate ) , was 64 . 2 + - - 4 . 0 % ( n = 3 ) , while the corresponding histamine release by con - trol cells , incubated in the absence of polymyxin B sulfate , was 9 . 9 - - - 1 . 0 % ( n = 4 ) . To determine whether the surface features of mast cells change as a result of stimulation and secretion , a qualitative evaluation of the extent of folding was carried out as follows : Each of two preparations of cells was divided into control and stimulated populations . 50 cells from each popula - tion were randomly selected in SEM at low magni - fication ( (cid:141) 100 ) at which any surface detail is indistinguishable . Magnification was then in - creased to (cid:141) 10 , 000 , and if the cells met the criteria of being undamaged , spherical , and unob - structed , they were photographed . In this manner , 200 cells were systematically photographed . For each cell , a number was assigned on a scale of 1 to 3 , depending on the extent of folds on the cell surface . Category 1 represents cells with very few folds ( including raspberry - type cells ) , category 2 , cells with an intermediate range of folds , and category 3 , cells with extensively folded surfaces . The three cells in Fig . 1 are representative of each category . The numbers of cells falling into each category were compared in the paired control and stimulated populations ( Table I ) . The results show that more cells have extensively folded surfaces in the stimulated populations than in the control populations . To confirm the results obtained with the qualita - tive evaluation , a semiquantitative method was developed for measuring fold length per cell . If the simplifying assumption is made that fold width and depth are relatively uniform from cell to cell , then fold length becomes the variable that allows direct comparison of one mast cell to another . 100 randomly selected cells from a third preparation , divided into control and stimulated populations , FIGURE 1 The various appearances of the mast cell surface in SEM . These cells are taken from both control and stimulated populations and are arranged in order of increasingly folded surfaces . 1A : Category 1 : a rasp - berry - type cell ; 1 B : Category 2 : cell with an intermedi - ate range of folds ; 1 C : Category 3 : cell with an exten - sively folded surface .

Fold length measurements were car - ded out according to the method described in Fig . 2 . For each cell , a ratio of fold length in microme - ters per square micrometers of surface area was calculated , and the distributions of cells according to these ratios were compared in the paired con - trol and stimulated populations ( Fig . 3 ) . Fold length varies over a range from 0 / zm / / zm 2 surface area ( raspberry - type cells ) to - 2 . 4 / . tm / / zm 2 sur - face area , and the distribution resembles a poisson distribution ( Fig . 3 a ) .

There is an overall shift in distribution as a result of stimulation ( Fig . 3b ) , again demonstrating a positive correlation be - tween secretion of histamine and the appearance of membrane folds . The average length of folds per cell for the stimulated population increases - 23 % as a result of secretion of 64 % of the histamine present ( Ta - ble II ) . The relationship between the secretory activity of a population and cell size is shown in Table III . The average cell radius decreases ~ 5 % upon stimulation . However , this shrinkage alone cannot account for the above increase in mem - brane fold length ( Fig . 4 ) . At most , 0 . 07 / zm folds / / xm 2 surface area can be generated from the membrane area made available by cell shrinkage . Since the average increase in fold length from control to stimulated cell is - 0 . 3 / ~ m / / ~ m 2 surface area ( Table II ) , the 0 . 07 / zm folds / ~ m 2 can ac - count for , at most , - 23 % of the 0 . 3 / zm / p . m 2 membrane needed to generate the folds . Prolonged stimulation of cells for 15 min ( still at 18 ~ results in extensive cell damage and lysis . Cell recovery is checked by counting cells in a hemacytometer .

In summary , upon prolonged stimulation , 27 % of the cells are not even re - covered , and 29 % are damaged , leaving only 44 % of the initial population intact . Of this 44 % , a great majority ( > 80 % ) appear to be raspberry - type cells or cells with relatively few folds ( 0 - 1 . 0 / xm / / zm 2 , Fig . 3a ) . Therefore , these remaining cells must be relatively resistant to polymyxin treatment , and the raspberry - type cell appears to be particularly insensitive to polymyxin relative to other mast cells .

These folds correspond to the microvil - lus - like projections previously observed in thin sections . Other cells , observed in SEM as having similar folds , distinct from microvilli , are disso - ciated epithelial cells ( 24 ) . The mast cell folds appear to vary in length from cell to cell to a far greater extent than they vary in width and depth . Some cells lack folds entirely , whereas other cells are completely cov - ered with them . The complete range of cell surface appearances is found in both control and stimu - lated populations . However , qualitative evalua - tion of 200 cells in two separate preparations suggested that more cells have extensively folded surfaces in the stimulated populations than in the control populations . To test this observation fur - ther , a semiquantitative method was devised to compare the extent of plasma membrane folding on control vs . stimulated cells . The length of folds per cell was chosen as the variable allowing com - parison of one mast cell to another . A positive correlation between histamine secretion and fold length was found . This method tends to minimize the difference between control and stimulated cells , because observations in transmission elec - tron microscopy ( 16 ) have tentatively suggested that fold depth may actually increase with stimula - tion . Expansion of the surface area of the mast cell plasma membrane as a result of exocytosis was first reported by Kinsolving et al . ( 10 ) , using an increase in acridone - binding capacity as an indica - tor of newly available membrane surface area . The increase in plasma membrane area was re - lated to histamine secretion ( 15 ) , with 63 % hista - mine release corresponding to a 350 % plasma membrane expansion . The apparent discrepancy between those results and the results presented here is due to the fact that in the experiments of Kinsolving et al . , the internal cavities formed by compound exocytosis are included in the measure - ment . The current observations on plasma mem - brane expansion are limited to the increase in surface area visible as membrane folds on the cell surface . Cell shrinkage associated with secretion will not provide sufficient membrane for generation of folds in stimulated cells . The rapidity of the change ( within 60 s ) probably precludes de novo membrane synthesis as the source of the needed membrane . Therefore , the membrane for fold for - mation probably comes from granule membrane incorporated into plasma membrane after mem - brane fusion and exocytosis . Incorporation of vesi - cle membrane into plasma membrane after release of secretory product has been shown to occur in several secretory systems : in frog neuromuscular junction after prolonged stimulation ( 8 ) , in Tetra - hymena in which synchronous release has been induced ( 21 , 22 ) , in sperm after acrosome dis - charge ( 5 ) , and in the secretory cells of the duck salt gland ( 13 ) . The raspberry - type cell , the cell that lacks mem - brane folds , does not appear to be a damaged cell or an artifact of preparation , in contrast to views previously stated ( 9 , 23 ) . Rather , it is part of the normal mast cell population , and its proportion is higher than would be expected from a poisson distribution . This cell is resistant to damage by prolonged exposure to polymyxin under condi - tions which damage other mast cells . The rasp - berry - type cell may be harder to induce to secrete , due to its having less surface area , or having im - mature membrane which may lack necessary re - ceptor molecules for stimulation . The results sug - gest that cells with greater surface area ( exten - sively folded surfaces ) are more susceptible to stimulation , having perhaps more receptor mole - cules available . One might speculate that addi - tional receptors may be contributed by the interior surface of the granule membrane which , upon fusion , becomes the exterior surface of the plasma membrane . A positive feedback mechanism may be involved in the explosive nature of mast cell secretion at physiological temperature : stimula - tion ~ increase in folds ( receptors ) ~ further stimulation . A positive feedback effect could ac - count for previously stimulated cells being espe - cially susceptible to damage and lysis by further stimulation . Raspberry - type cells may represent different stages of mast cell maturation , during either ( a ) differentiation , or ( b ) recovery after depletion of secretory products . As for the first possibility , a precursor cell of the fully differentiated mast cell still has not been positively identified . With regard to the second possibility , the mast cell should theoretically be able to synthesize and package new product , to " recycle " , because its plasma membrane remains intact and all necessary cyto - plasmic organelles are present . However , the process of recovery after depletion has not been well studied in mast cells . Finally , the raspberry - S . J . BURWEN AND B . H . SATI ~ Plasma Membrane Folds on the Mast Cell Surface 695 type cell may represent a less mature form of a mast cell that is less susceptible to stimulation . The fact that raspberry - type cells can be se - lected for by their ability to survive prolonged stimulation ( 15 min ) may provide a means for isolating them from other cells present . Thus , problems of differentiation , recycling , membrane sites , etc . could possibly be specifically studied in these cells . The authors wish to acknowledge the assistance of Dr .
