The use of metallic nanoparticles for the electrical contacting of redox enzymes with electrodes , and as catalytic labels for the development of electrochemical biosensors is discussed . Similarly , biomolecule - quantum dot hybrid systems are implemented for optical biosensing , and for monitoring intracellular metabolic processes .

The future perspectives of the ﬁeld are addressed by discussing future challenges and highlighting different potential applications . KEYWORDS Nanoparticles , quantum dots , sensor , DNA , nanowires , nanostructures , nanodevices N anomaterials such as metal nanoparticles ( NPs ) or nanowires , semiconductor quantum dots ( QDs ) , carbon nanotubes , or inorganic nanowires exhibit unique electronic , optical , and catalytic properties . The dimensional similarities of these nanomaterials and bio - molecules , such as enzymes , antibodies ( antigens ) , or DNA , suggest that the integration of biomolecules with these nano - objects may generate hybrid systems that combine the properties of the nanomaterials with the natural recognition and catalytic functions of biomolecules . 1 , 2 These biomolecule - NPs ( QDs , nanotubes , etc . ) hybrids may then provide a new class of nanomateri - als that reveal new tailored functionalities . Also , nano - technology provides new tools to image and manipulate chemically modiﬁed surfaces and to probe chemical inter - actions at the molecular level . This enables not only the application of these microscopic tools to characterize the structure - function relationships of biomolecule - nano - objects hybrids , but also to functionalize the nanometric tools with biomolecules and use them for the precise posi - tioning of biomolecules and as biocatalytic manipulators at the nanoscale . 3 Biomolecules themselves represent nanoscale materi - als with encoded structural and functional information . The ability to modify proteins by genetic means or chemi - cal methods , to elicit antibodies or catalytic antibodies , to select and amplify nucleic acid structures with tailored speciﬁc binding properties ( aptamers ) or catalytic func - tionalities ( DNAzymes ) , paves the way to implement the modiﬁed biomolecules or the man - made biomolecular analogs as building blocks to self - assemble and organize functional nanostructures . Examples include the use of nucleic acid templates to activate enzyme cascades , 4 the ingenious self - assembly of nanoscale nucleic acid building blocks into mesoscale structures , 5 or the self - organization of supramolecular DNA nanostructures acting as nanoma - chines . 6 Indeed , tremendous progress was accomplished in the past decades in developing biomolecule - based nanomaterials and nanostructures and their application for sensing , nanocircuitry , nanoscale machinery , logic operations , and the fabrication of nanodevices . These ad - vances were summarized in many review articles ad - dressing different facets of nanobioscience . 1 , 2 The present article aims to discuss the broad perspectives of biomole - cule - based nanomaterials by introducing the topics with representative examples . Since our laboratory was ac - tively involved in developing the area of nanobioscience , we highlight our accomplishments within the broad scope of the area , while discussing the future perspectives of the ﬁeld . The electrical contacting of the redox - active sites of enzymes with electrodes is one of the most fundamental issues in bioelectrochemistry and provides the basis for the development of amperometric biosensors and biofuel * Towhomcorrespondenceshouldbeaddressed .

Different methods to electrically “wire” re - dox enzymes with electrodes , by shortening electron transfer distances , were developed , and these included the modiﬁcation of proteins with electron relays , 9 the im - mobilization of the biocatalysts in redox polymers , 10 and the reconstitution of apo - enzymes on relay - cofactor monolayers associated with electrodes . 11 The unique elec - tronic properties of metal NPs or CNTs were implemented to electrically wire redox enzymes with electrodes . The conductive nano - objects act in these systems as im - planted nanoelectrodes that shorten electron transfer dis - tances and act as relays for transporting electrodes be - tween the redox sites of the enzyme and the electrode . For example , Au NPs ( 1 . 2 nm diameter ) were functional - ized with cofactor units , such as the N 6 - aminoethyl ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide , NH 2 - FAD ( 1 ) , cofactor or the pyr - roloquinoline quinone , PQQ ( 2 ) , cofactor and apo - glucose oxidase , apo - GOx , or apo - glucose dehydrogenase , apo - GDH ( proteins lacking the native FAD or PQQ cofactors ) were reconstituted on the FAD or PQQ cofactor - function - alized Au NPs . 12 , 13 The resulting Au NP - enzyme hybrids were then linked to Au - surfaces by dithiol bridges , and the integrated enzyme electrodes revealed effective elec - trical communication with the electrodes , leading to the bioelectrocatalytic activation of the enzyme . The effective electrical wiring of the enzyme ( k et ∼ 5000 electron·s - 1 ) was attributed to the structural alignment of the redox cofactors in respect to the Au NPs relays implanted in the proteins , Figure 1A . Similarly , carbon nanotubes , modi - ﬁed at the ends with the amino - FAD cofactor ( 1 ) , were implanted into apo - GOx via the reconstitution process , and this led to electrically contacted enzyme electrodes , Figure 1B . 14 The carbon nanotubes acted in this system as charge carriers from the enzyme redox center to the electrode , resulting in the bioelectrocatalytic activation of the enzyme . Interestingly , the effectiveness of electrical “wiring” of the biocatalyst with the electrode was found to inversely relate to the length of the connecting nanotubes ( k et ∝ 1 / l where l is the length of the CNTs ) . While this re - sult seems to be inconsistent with the ballistic conduc - tance of the carbon nanotubes connectors , the phenom - enon was attributed to defects introduced into the sidewalls of the CNTs in the course of preparing the CNTs / enzyme hybrid nanostructures . That is , the prerequisite to cut the CNTs and modify their ends with carboxylic acid residues was essential to construct the hybrid nanostruc - FIGURE 1 .

This oxidative process resulted in the formation of defects in the sidewalls of the tubes , and these perturbed the conductance of electrons through the CNTs . As the probability for forming defects relates directly to the length of the tubes , the effectiveness of “wiring” of the biocatalysts relates inversely to the length of the tubes . The implant of metallic NPs into proteins is , also , im - portant for the photonic wiring of proteins with elec - trodes , and the activation of their photoelectrochemical functions . 15 This was demonstrated by the photochemical synthesis of Pt nanoclusters at the photoactive center of the photosynthetic reaction center PS - I , and the assembly of the Pt nanoclusters / PS - I hybrid on electrodes . The trap - ping of the photoexcited electrons by the Pt nanoclusters was found to facilitate charge separation , and the trans - port of the trapped electrons to the electrode , thus leading to the effective generation of photocurrents . The use of metal NPs / protein hybrids was further extended to yield electrically contacted three - dimensional electrically con - tacted matrices on electrodes , 16 and these enzyme / NPs composites hold great promise in future sensing applica - tions and the design of biofuel cells or photobiofuel cell systems . Metallic NPs exhibit catalytic properties , and these may be used for ampliﬁed biosensing . For example , Pt NPs were found to exhibit horseradish peroxidase - like catalytic activities , such as the electrocatalytic reduction of H 2 O 2 or the catalytic generation of chemiluminescence in the presence of luminol and H 2 O 2 . 17 , 18 Accordingly , nucleic acid - functionalized Pt NPs were used as conju - gates for the ampliﬁed electrochemical or chemilumines - cence detection of DNA or aptamer - substrate complexes . For example , the ampliﬁed detection of thrombin , that includes two binding sites for its aptamers , was achieved by the use of the aptamer - functionalized Pt NPs conjugate as amplifying reporter , Figure 1C . Binding of thrombin to the aptamer - functionalized electrode was followed by the secondary association of the aptamer - modiﬁed Pt NPs that acted as electrocatalytic or chemiluminescent re - porter units . The catalytic growth of metallic NPs on metal nanoclusters seeds was also used for optical or electronic biosensing . Different enzymes that generate reducing products , such as oxidases ( generating H 2 O 2 ) , 19 hydroge - nases ( generating the NAD ( P ) H cofactors ) , 20 or proteases ( such as alkaline phosphatase that generates cathecol products ) , 20 were assayed by the biocatalytic growth of Au NPs . For example , glucose oxidase 19 and alcohol dehy - drogenase and their substrates 20 were optically analyzed by following the plasmon absorbance of the grown NPs . Similarly , tyrosinase was assayed by spectroscopically following the oxidation of tyrosine to L - DOPA and the sub - sequent growth of Au NPs . 21 The catalytic growth of Au NPs also was used for the electrical detection of DNA , Fig - ure 1D . 22 A capturing nucleic acid was immobilized on a gap - surface separating two electrodes . The hybridization of the target analyte DNA and the subsequent binding of nucleic acid - functionalized Au NPs to the resulting hybrid generated a catalytic composite for the growth of the NPs with a silver shell in the presence of hydroquinone . The enlarged particles then generated conductivity paths that bridged the microelectrodes thus decreasing the resis - tance across the gap , Figure 1E . The resistance was found to decrease upon the increase in the target concentration , accompanied by the increase in the coverage of the cata - lytic labels . By the thermal control of the hybridization between the capture nucleic acid and the target analyte DNA , single - base mismatch detection in the analyte se - quence was demonstrated . Semiconductor nanoparticles ( quantum dots , QDs ) pro - vide nanoscale materials exhibiting unique optical proper - ties reﬂected by size - controlled ﬂuorescence features , high luminescence quantum yields , narrow luminescence spectra and large Stokes shifts , and stability against pho - tobleaching . The size - controlled luminescence features of QDs are particularly attractive for sensing , as they enable the use of the variable - sized same materials as different labels for multiplexed analyses . Indeed , tremendous progress was achieved in the past decade in the use of biomolecule - QDs hybrid systems for bioanalytical applica - tions . 23 While early studies have implemented antibody - or nucleic acid - functionalized QDs of variable sizes for the multiplexed analysis of pathogens 24 or DNAs , 25 later stud - ies have used biomolecule - QDs hybrids together with ﬂuo - rescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) or electron transfer ( ET ) as photophysical mechanisms to probe bio - catalytic transformations as well as to follow recognition events . For example , the ribonucleoprotein telomerase that catalyzes the elongation of the telomer chains is known as a versatile biomarker for cancer cells , 26 and it was analyzed by CdSe QDs , Figure 2A . 27 The QDs were functionalized with the nucleic acid primer , ( 3 ) , that is recognized by telomerase . Upon the treatment of the modiﬁed QDs with a HeLa cancer cell extract that in - cluded telomerase , and in the presence of the nucleotide mixture dNTPs that contained the Texas - Red dUTP , ( 4 ) , telomerization proceeded on the QDs . The resulting Texas - Red - labeled telomer triggered - on the FRET process from the QDs to the dye units , thus enabling the time - dependent analysis of the enzyme activity , Figure 2B . A related FRET process was used to follow the activity of caseine kinase ( CK - 2 ) , as a representative of kinases that play key roles in signal transduction and the regulation of intracellular processes , Figure 2C . 28 The serine - containing peptide sequence , ( 5 ) , was linked to CdSe QDs , and it acted as substrate for CK - 2 that stimulates the phosphory - lation of the serine residue to the phosphorylated product , ( 6 ) . By the association of the Atto - 590 - labeled antibody , speciﬁc for the phosphorylated peptide , the FRET process from the QDs to the Atto - 590 acceptor was triggered - on , resulting in the ﬂuorescence of the acceptor dye , provid - PERSPECTIVE © 2010 American Chemical Society 3807 DOI : 10 . 1021 / nl102083j | Nano Lett . 2010 , 10 , 3805 - – 3815 ing a quantitative optical signal for the activity of CK - 2 . The modiﬁcation of different - sized QDs with peptide sub - strates speciﬁc for different kinases then could provide an attractive approach for the multiplexed analysis of differ - ent kinases . Similar FRET - based assays were used to fol - low the activities of different proteolytic enzymes . 29 QDs were functionalized with dye - labeled peptides speciﬁc to different proteases , and the FRET process from the QDs to the dye units proceeded in the peptide - functionalized nanocrystals . The protease - induced cleavage of the pep - tides removed the dye acceptor units , thus switching off the FRET process , while restoring the luminescence of the QDs . Such FRET processes between QDs and acceptor dyes provide a general and versatile optical readout for sensing platforms that follow the formation of biorecogni - tion complexes , such as DNA hybridization 30 or the for - mation of aptamer - substrate complexes . 31 The speciﬁc binding of ions to purine and pyrimidine bases of DNA was used to develop ion - speciﬁc and multi - plexed sensing of ions using nucleic acid - functionalized QDs . 32 CdSe / ZnS QDs emitting at 560 nm were function - alized with oligo thymine - rich nucleic acid chains , and QDs emitting at 620 nm were modiﬁed with oligo - cy - tosine chains . As the thymine bases form T - Hg 2 + - T com - plexes , and the cytosine bases yield speciﬁc C - Ag + - C com - plexes , the formation of the respective Hg 2 + - thymine nucleic acid structures and the Ag 2 + - cysteine nucleic acid complexes on the respective QDs resulted in the electron - transfer quenching of the respective QDs , Figure 2D , and the multiplexed analysis of the two ions , Figure 2E . The progress in designing artiﬁcial heterocyclic bases or ligand - conjugated bases that bind other ions in duplex DNA nanostructures 33 suggests that other ions could be speciﬁcally sensed by appropriate , differently sized , nu - cleic acid - functionalized QDs . Surface - modiﬁed QDs hold great promise as optical labels for the monitoring of intracellular processes . For example , Nile - Blue ( NB ) - functionalized QDs revealed the luminescence quenching of the QDs by a FRET mecha - nism . 34 The reduction of the NB - units by 1 , 4 - dihydronic - FIGURE 2 .

This process was used to sense the NAD ( P ) H cofactors , and a series of NAD ( P ) + - dependent enzymes and their substrates , 34 but more importantly , the modiﬁed QDs were implemented to follow intracellu - lar metabolism . This latter process demonstrated the use of the functionalized QDs as optical labels for the screen - ing of anticancer drugs . The NB - modiﬁed QDs were intro - duced into the cytoplasm of HeLa cancer cells that were grown under starvation , and subjected to the addition of D - glucose that activated the intracellular metabolism . The activation of the intracellular processes generated the NAD ( P ) H cofactors , resulting in the enhanced lumines - cence from the QDs , Figure 3B . A control experiment that used L - glucose , that is not recognized by the cells , did not alter the luminescence of the QDs , implying that the lumi - nescence changes originated , indeed , from the activation of the cell metabolism . The HeLa cells were then cultured in the presence of Taxol , ( 7 ) , a drug known to inhibit the metabolic processes occurring in the cytoplasm . Indeed , the Taxol - treated cells revealed only minute increase in the luminescence of the QDs , as compared to the non - treated HeLa cells , consistent with the inhibition of the intracellular metabolism in the drug - treated cells , Figure 3C . Besides the signiﬁcant progress in using hybrid biomol - ecule / metal NPs or semiconductor QDs for sensing , these nanobiohybrids ﬁnd growing interest as building units of nanocircuits and nanodevices . Different biomolecular templates , such as duplex DNA 35 , 36 or protein nano - tubes , 37 acted as templates for the growth of metallic or semiconductor nanowires . For example , the chemical growth of Ag nanoclusters associated with duplex DNA , 35 or the catalytic enlargement of Ag NPs incorporated into (cid:1) - amyloid nanotubes 37 generated metallic nanowires . The base sequence in DNA provides encoded instructive infor - mation for programmed self - assembly of nucleic acid nanostructures that reveal dictated functionalities . Guided hybridization , binding of speciﬁc low molecular weight or macromolecular substrates ( by aptamers ) , or catalytic functions of nucleic acids represent some of these unique properties of DNA . Indeed , intriguing one - dimensional , 38 two - dimensional , 39 and three - dimensional 40 DNA or DNA - protein nanostructures were designed in the past few years . By the appropriate design of the DNA nanostruc - tures , hybrid metal nanoparticles / DNA nanostructures were synthesized . For example , a two - dimensional DNA array was organized by the self - assembly of 21 single strands of DNA that generate four different double - cross - over tiles , Figure 4A . 41 The hybridization of Au NPs func - tionalized with a nucleic acid tether complementary to one of the tiles enabled then the organization of two - di - mensional Au NPs arrays with programmed spacing , Fig - ure 4A , B . This methodology was extended to generate tubular nanostructures of DNA carrying ordered conﬁgu - rations of 5 nm Au NPs . 42 The folding of a two - dimen - sional array generated by the assembly of four double - crossover tiles , where the Au NPs were tethered to one of the tiles , yielded the tubular ordering of the NPs . Interest - ingly , four types of tubular Au NPs structures were identi - ﬁed , where the symmetrical folding led to stacked rings of the particles , and the nonsymmetrical linkage of the edges of the tiles led to single - spiral , double - spiral , and nested - spiral nanotubes , Figure 4C . A different approach to construct DNA metal nanoparticle hybrid systems has involved the programmed encapsulation of Au NPs in FIGURE 3 .

The interlinkage of the differently sized triangles in the pres - ence of Au NPs , by means of three duplex DNA strands with appropriate sticky - ends for hybridization to the re - spective DNA tethers associated with the triangles , “stapled” the triangles into nanotubes that incorporated the Au NPs , Figure 4E . By varying the sizes of the Au NPs , the NPs could be addressed either to the small or the large capsule domains of the nanotubes . Furthermore , by the displacement of the “staple” DNA strands by comple - mentary nucleic acids , the nanotubes were separated to the triangle building blocks while releasing the Au NPs . This exempliﬁes one of the future potential applications of such DNA / metal nanoparticle hybrids in the triggered - release of nanocargos from the organized nanostructures . The biocatalytic growth of metallic NPs provided a method to synthesize metallic nanowires . 44 Glucose oxi - dase ( GOx ) or alkaline phosphatase ( AlkPh ) were function - alized with Au NPs ( 1 . 2 nm diameter ) and deposited onto Si surfaces by dip - pen nanolithography ( DPN ) , Figure 5A .

By the sequential deposition of the two enzymes on the surface , the orthogonal synthesis of two different metallic nano - wires ( Au° and Ag° ) was demonstrated . Similarly , a single - stranded DNA template that was synthesized by the rolling circle ampliﬁcation process ( RCA ) and consisted of constant repeat units was used as a template for the syn - thesis of metallic nanowires , Figure 5B . The hybridization of Au NP - modiﬁed glucose oxidase , functionalized with nucleic acid tethers complementary to the repeat units of the template , generated an integrated biocatalytic protein / DNA nanowire structure , and this acted as a template for growing the metallic nanowires . 46 The formation of metallic nanowires on biomolecular templates enabled the fabrication of nanodevices and nanomotors . For example , the polymerization of Au NP - functionalized g - actin units generated the Au NPs - modi - ﬁed f - actin ﬁlaments , and these were further extended at their ends by nonmodiﬁed actin units , Figure 6A . The catalytic enlargement of the Au NPs yielded Au - nanowires ﬂanked by actin ﬁlament tethers , Figure 6B . 47 Upon the deposition of the actin - metal nanowire - actin struc - tures on a myosin - functionalized glass surface , the re - spective actin - myosin motor protein complexes were generated , and upon the addition of the ATP fuel , the motility of the actin - Au nanowires on the myosin sur - face was imaged , Figure 6C . The random motility of the nanostructures on the surface at a speed of 25 nm·sec - 1 was demonstrated . Such motor nanostruc - tures , consisting of biomolecule - metal nanowire hy - brids , hold promise as future nanotransporting ele - ments . ( For example , the thermal release of drugs immobilized on the metallic nanowires ) . The deposition of metal nanoclusters on composite biomolecular templates and the catalytic enlargement of the nanoclusters into conductive domains was imple - mented to fabricate a nanostructured ﬁeld - effect transis - tor device . 48 The sequence - speciﬁc winding of a homolo - gous nucleic acid into duplex DNA by the RecA protein carrier was used to address the nucleic acid / protein com - plex in a long duplex DNA scaffold , Figure 7A . The bind - ing of the anti - Rec A antibody to the protein , followed by the association of the biotinylated anti - antibody , shielded the respective DNA scaffold domain . The binding of streptavidin - coated carbon nanotubes to the protein domain , followed by cation exchange and functional - ization of the DNA phosphate residues with Ag + - ions assembled the composite nanostructure for the fabrica - tion of the ﬁeld - effect transistor device . The deposition of the composite nanostructure in the gap separating two microelectrodes , followed by the reduction of the Ag + - ions associated with the nonprotein - coated DNA segments , and their catalytic enlargement with gold , generated the metallic contacts that bridged the single - FIGURE 6 .

Conclusions and Perspectives . The article has dis - cussed recent advances in nanobioscience by addressing different applications of hybrid nanostructures consisting of biomolecules and metallic or semiconductor nonparti - cles ( or carbon nanotubes ) . The article did not attempt to provide a comprehensive survey of the research area , but aimed to highlight the accomplishments of our laboratory within the general scope of the topic , while addressing the future potential applications of the different functional nanostructures . Indeed , impressive progress was achieved in the application of hybrid biomolecular nanostructures for the development of sensors , nanocircuitry and de - vices , and the future perspectives of the ﬁeld are bright . The integration of biomolecules with nanoelements , such as metallic or semiconductor nanoclusters , introduced new directions to the ﬁeld of bioanalysis and sensor de - sign . The tailoring of reconstituted redox - enzyme / metallic NPs ( or carbon nanotubes ) hybrids on electrodes not only resolves the fundamental problem of electrical wiring of redox proteins with electrodes , but it provides new oppor - tunities to design miniaturized , implantable , amperomet - ric sensors , and efﬁcient biofuel cell elements . 49 Similarly , the unique size - controlled optical properties of metallic nanoparticles or semiconductor quantum dots found broad applicabilities in bioanalytical science . Different sensing platforms implementing the plasmonic effects of metallic nanoparticles were developed . 50 The progress in the synthesis of shaped metallic nanoparticles , such as tripod , tetrapod , or hollow metal NPs , exhibiting new plasmonic features , suggests that extensive theoretical and experimental efforts will be directed to characterize these nanostructures and use them to develop new sensor systems . Also , the substitution of organic dyes by semi - conductor QDs as optical labels for biorecognition events ﬁnds growing interest . Speciﬁcally , the size - controlled lu - minescence features of QDs facilitate the design of ﬂuo - rescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) pairs , and their application to follow the dynamics of biorecognition or biocatalytic processes is anticipated to attract growing interest . Also , the size - controlled luminescence properties of QDs are expected to lead to new optical chips for mul - tiplexed analysis . Important future applications of semi - conductor QDs are still ahead of us . The incorporation of biomolecule - QDs nanostructures into cells could introduce new possibilities to target speciﬁc intracellular domains , thus enabling the imaging of biotransformations with nanoscale precision .

The progress in fabricating nanoscale gaps be - tween electrodes and the development of methods that deposit biomolecule - NPs hybrids in these gaps paves the way to construct new bioelectronic devices . Furthermore , the programmed deposition of stimuli - activated biomole - cule / NPs hybrids on patterned nanostructures could lead to nanorobots or nanotransporting devices . Such devices have great potential in future nanomedicine and drug de - livery . In fact , recent reports 51 indicated that such sys - tems can be constructed , and future activities along these directions should be encouraged . While substantial progress in the assembly of functional biomolecule / NPs was accomplished , numerous scientiﬁc challenges are ahead of us . These provide a rich playground for interdis - ciplinary future research efforts . Acknowledgment . The skilled and highly motivated research team members of our laboratory should be ac - knowledged . Their names appear in the list of references . The continuous support of the Israel Science Foundation is gratefully acknowledged . REFERENCES AND NOTES ( 1 ) Katz , E . ; Willner , I . Angew . Chem . , Int . Ed . 2004 , 43 , 6042 – 6108 .
