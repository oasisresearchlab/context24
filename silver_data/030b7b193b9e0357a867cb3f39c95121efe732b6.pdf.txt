Abstract Background and aims Badnaviruses and their host - integrated DNA occur in tropical crops and a few northern tem - perate species . Following the discovery of a badnavirus on a subantarctic island with ﬂoristic links to New Zealand , we postulated that badnaviruses exist in the New Zealand ﬂora . Badna - virus reverse transcriptase ( RT ) sequences consist of variable regions ﬂanked by highly con - served regions . This study used RT sequences to detect and characterize badnavirus sequences in the New Zealand ﬂora and to investigate their utility for the study of broader aspects of plant biology . Methodology Molecular diversity of RT sequences was analysed using polymerase chain reaction and dena - turing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) . In a study of the genus Melicytus , internal tran - scribed spacer ( ITS ) sequences were compared with the RT data . Principal results No freely replicating badnaviruses were detected but more than half of the species ( 37 / 60 ) contained RT sequences . Phylogenetic analysis of 21 RT sequences formed monophyletic groups distinct from other species and from badnaviruses . No frameshift mutations occurred in any of the sequences translated in silico . More detailed study of the genus Melicytus indi - cated broader applications for our approach . Analysis of RT sequences revealed the presence of a previously unrecognized species ( conﬁrmed using ITS ) . Inheritance of DGGE proﬁles by Melicytus ramiﬂorus seedlings suggested that this species may undergo apomixis . Conclusions The presence of integrated badnavirus sequences in a wide range of taxa from this Southern Hemisphere ﬂora indicates that these sequences may be common in many temperate regions . Potential to activate viruses from these sequences should be considered when placing these species in tissue culture or under other forms of abiotic or genomic stress . Analysis of endogenous RT sequences shows potential for the study of systematics , phylogenetics and plant reproductive biology . Introduction Members of the plant virus family Caulimoviridae possess a circular double - stranded DNA genome of (cid:1) 7 – 8 kb . Caulimoviridae are pararetroviruses as they replicate through an obligatory RNA intermediate but , unlike animal retroviruses , do not need to integrate into the host genome to complete their replication cycle . The Caulimoviridae is divided into six genera : Caulimovirus , Soymovirus , Cavemovirus , Petuvirus , Badnavirus and Tun - grovirus ( Fauquet et al . 2005 ) . Three of these genera * Corresponding author’s e - mail address : paul . guy @ botany . otago . ac . nz Published by Oxford University Press .

Such endogenous pararetro - viruses ( EPRVs ) form a distinct class of retroelements and have been found in a variety of crop and ornamental plants . For example , banana contains , and taro and yucca most likely contain , integrated badnavirus sequences ( Clover et al . 2003 ; Yang et al . 2003 ; Geering et al . 2005 a , b ; Gambley et al . 2008 ) as well as freely replicating , transmissible , badnaviruses . Eudicots such as Citrus , Theobroma , Ribes and Rubus contain badna - viruses , but it is not known whether they contain inte - grated badnavirus sequences . A number of eudicots do , however , contain integrated forms of other genera of Caulimoviridae ( Hohn et al . 2008 ) . Although a few badnaviruses have been isolated from cultivated plants from northern temperate regions , bad - naviruses are generally considered to be of tropical or subtropical origin . Recently a new species of badnavirus , Stilbocarpa mosaic bacilliform virus ( SMBV ) , was reported infecting Stilbocarpa polaris on subantarctic Macquarie Island ( Skotnicki et al . 2003 ) . Although the subantarctic islands are among the most remote places on Earth , of the 21 species of dicotyledons that occur on Macquarie Island , 19 are also part of the New Zealand ﬂora ( Allan 1982 ; Hnatiuk 1993 ) . The unexpected discovery of SMBV indicated that the New Zealand ﬂora may harbour unique viruses and pararetroviral sequences that have been evolving in isolation for a long period of their evolutionary history . To date no badnaviruses have been recorded in the New Zealand ﬂora ( Pearson et al . 2006 ) . New Zealand’s ﬂora has strong afﬁnities with the ﬂoras of other Southern Hemisphere landmasses and there has been much debate over whether these afﬁ - nities reﬂect ancient Gondwanan connections or more recent dispersal events . Molecular phylogenies show that many plant lineages are recent arrivals in New Zealand , which have diversiﬁed and then travelled to other Southern Hemisphere landmasses ( Winkworth et al . 2002 ) . We chose to study Melicytus ( Violaceae ) in detail as the genus appears to have evolved in New Zealand and dispersed north into the south - western Paciﬁc and west into Australia and Tasmania ( Mitchell et al . 2009 ) . Melicytus ramiﬂorus is a small tree found in lowland forest throughout New Zealand . It extends offshore to the Three Kings Islands , Kermadec Islands and Norfolk Island . Closely allied species are found in Tonga , Samoa , Solomon Islands , Vanuatu and Fiji ( Kellogg and Weitzman 1985 ) . Melicytus alpinus is a widely distributed shrub found mainly on the dryer eastern side of the South Island where it is found predominantly in grass - land and shrubland ( Mitchell et al . 2009 ) . Species related to M . alpinus are found offshore in eastern and South Australia and Tasmania . Other species of Melicytus have more restricted distributions , with Melicytus chathamicus being conﬁned to the Chatham Island group which lies 700 km east of the South Island ( Mitch - ell et al . 2009 ) . In this paper , we used speciﬁc polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) primers to amplify a 530 - nucleotide sequence of badnavirus reverse transcriptase ( RT ) to investigate the diversity and abundance of badnavirus sequences in the New Zealand ﬂora . We found that often individual plants contained mixed populations of the target sequence . These mixed sequences were closely related and were resolved by denaturing gradi - ent gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) giving characteristic band patterns for each species examined . In one species ( M . ramiﬂorus ) , DGGE band patterns were shown to be inherited . Materials and methods Study species Unless otherwise stated , plants showing no visible signs of disease were collected from a range of habitats in the vicinity of Dunedin , East Otago , Lower South Island , New Zealand . Approximately 10 % of samples were mechani - cally inoculated to subsets of the species listed in Guy et al . ( 1984 ) in an attempt to detect latent virus infec - tion . Extracts of the species listed with a superscript in Table 1 ( 200 mM phosphate buffer pH 6 . 1 , 0 . 5 % sodium sulphite , 0 . 5 % 2 - mercaptoethanol , 2 % poly - ethylene glycol 6000 , 2 % polyvinyl pyrrolidone ) were clariﬁed by centrifugation ( 10 000 × g / 20 min ) and then adjusted to 6 % PEG - 6000 ﬁnal concentration . The clari - ﬁed extracts were incubated at 4 8 C for 2 h and centri - fuged ( 10 000 × g / 20 min ) . The precipitate was resuspended ( 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 , 1 . 5 % sodium chloride , 2 % Triton X - 100 ) overnight at 4 8 C . Following centrifugation ( 5000 × g / 20 min ) the supernatant was centrifuged at 100 000 × g / 2 h and the resulting pellets were resuspended in distilled water and then examined for virus particles in a transmission electron microscope . Extraction of DNA Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh or frozen leaf tissue . A 50 mg sample of leaf tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in a lysing matrix tube con - taining a garnet matrix and 1 / 4 ′′ ceramic sphere ( Lysing Matrix A , Q - BIO gene , MP Biomedicals , LLC , 2 AoB PLANTS 2011 plr008 doi : 10 . 1093 / aobpla / plr008 . , available online at www . aobplants . oxfordjournals . org & The Authors 2011 Lyttle et al . — Badnavirus RT sequences in the NZ ﬂora . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The frozen sample was disrupted in a Retsch mixer mill Type 301 ( Retsch GmbH & Co . KG , Haan , Germany ) using three cycles of 30 s at 30 cycles per second . Following this step , the DNA was puriﬁed using a DNAeasy Plant Mini Kit ( Qiagen GmbH , Hilden , Germany ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Polymerase chain reaction ampliﬁcation All PCR ampliﬁcations were performed in a 20 m L volume containing 1 – 50 ng of template , 10 pmol each primer and 17 m L of Reddy Mix PCR master mix containing 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 ( Abgene Limited , Epsom , UK ) . Polymerase chain reaction products were puriﬁed using a QIAquick PCR puriﬁcation kit ( Qiagen ) prior to sequencing . The badna RT fragment was ampliﬁed using the degenerate primers HafF ( 5 ′ ATG CCI TTY GGI ITI AAR AAY GCI CC 3 ′ ) and HafR ( 5 ′ CCA YTT RCA IAC ISC ICC CCA ICC 3 ′ ) ( Yang et al . 2003 ) . For ampliﬁcation for DGGE , the HafR primer was modiﬁed by including a GC clamp ( 5 ′ AGC CGC GCG GCG GGC GGG GCG GGG GCA CGG CCA YTT RCA IAC ISC ICC CCA ICC 3 ′ ) . Polymerase chain reaction parameters were as follows : one cycle at 95 8 C for 5 min , then 35 cycles of 94 8 C for 30 s , 52 8 C for 1 min , 72 8 C for 1 min followed by one cycle of extension at 72 8 C for 30 min . For PCRs using the GC clamped primer , the cycle was modiﬁed by increasing the denaturing time to 1 min and the extension time to 2 min . The internal transcribed spacer ( ITS ) of nuclear ribo - somal DNA was ampliﬁed using the primers ITS - 1 and ITS - 4 ( White et al . 1990 ) . Polymerase chain reaction parameters were one cycle at 95 8 C for 5 min , then 35 cycles of 94 8 C for 1 min , 48 8 C for 45 s , 72 8 C for 2 min followed by one cycle of extension at 72 8 C for 10 min . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Gradient gels containing 8 % polyacrylamide ( 37 . 5 : 1 ratio of acrylamide : bis - acrylamide ) were formed using a peri - staltic pump ( Gilson Minipuls ) and a gradient mixing device ( Hoefer SG30 ) with a denaturant gradient of 25 – 40 % . Gels were run in 1 × Tris - acetate - EDTA buffer at 75 V , 400 mA for 16 h at 60 8 C . Gels were stained for 60 min in MilliQ water containing 0 . 5 mg of ethidium bromide per litre and destained for 30 min in MilliQ water . Gels were placed on a UV transilluminator and the digital images were recorded with a Kodak Gel Logic Imaging System ( Eastman Kodak Co . , Rochester , NY , USA ) . Bands of interest were excised from DGGE gels and DNA eluted by soaking in 100 m L of water ( MilliQ ) overnight . Aliquots of the eluate were re - ampliﬁed using the HafF and HafR primers and puri - ﬁed prior to sequencing . DNA sequencing Samples were sequenced by the Allan Wilson Centre Genome Service , Massey University , using the Applied Biosystems BigDye TM Terminator Version 3 . 1 Ready Reac - tion Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Life Technologies Corporation , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Analysis of badnavirus RT sequences All available badnavirus RT fragment sequences from GenBank ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / ) were aligned with the sequences obtained in this study using Clus - talW . Mismatched sequences and additional sequence representatives with . 95 % identity to existing sequences were removed from the alignment . The ﬁnal nucleotide alignment was then derived from the corre - sponding translated amino acid alignment that had been adjusted manually . The aligned dataset contained 534 nucleotide characters , of which 448 were parsimony informative . A maximum parsimony phylogenetic analy - sis was done using PAUP * version 4 . 0b10 ( Swofford 2003 ) , with Rice tungro bacilliform virus ( RTBV GenBank : AF113831 ) as the outgroup . One thousand heuristic search replicates were done , using the tree bisection - reconnection branch - swapping algorithm and a random addition of taxa for each replicate , saving 100 trees per replicate . Uninformative characters were excluded and gaps were treated as missing data . Branch support was assessed by bootstrap analysis , with 1000 bootstrap replicates . Each bootstrap replicate involved two replicate heuristic searches with random addition of taxa , saving a maximum of 50 trees per random addition replicate . Analysis of Melicytus ITS region Internal transcribed spacer sequences were aligned using ClustalW . The dataset contained 704 nucleotide characters and eight binary characters , representing indels coded as present ( 1 ) or absent ( 0 ) . A Bayesian inference phylogenetic analysis was done using MrBayes version 3 . 1 . 2 ( Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003 ) , using a general time reversible model with gamma - distributed rate variation across sites and a pro - portion of invariable sites . Four hundred and ﬁfty thou - sand generations were run , sampling every hundredth generation . The standard deviation of split frequencies was 0 . 008268 after 450 000 generations . Trees and branch length samples were summarized after discard - ing the ﬁrst 25 % ( 1125 ) of the samples . Results New Zealand plant species tested for badnavirus sequences A total of 60 species belonging to 28 genera and 22 families were tested ( Table 1 ) . A total of 37 species gave a positive result for the 530 bp fragment of RT with the remaining 23 being negative . No positives were found from species belonging to the families Apia - ceae , Araliacaeae , Escalloniaceae , Icacinaceae , Mora - ceae , Myrtaceae , Ripogonaceae , Rosaceae , Solanaceae and Urticaceae that were examined . Reverse transcrip - tase DNA sequences were detected in both endemic and other native species with wider distributions . Reverse transcriptase sequences were found in plant species from vegetation types ranging from tussock grassland communities to shrublands and forests . The RT sequences reported here were detected in a monocot ( Chionochloa rubra subsp . rubra var . inermis ) , a liane ( Parsonsia heterophylla ) and small trees and shrubs . Chionochloa rubra subsp . rubra var . inermis is a member of the widespread and ecologically important genus of snowgrasses ( Pirie et al . 2008 ) . Reverse tran - scriptase sequences were present in four widespread species of Myrsine and two Chatham Islands endemics Myrsine chathamica and M . coxii . Thirteen out of the 16 species of Coprosma , a large and taxonomically diverse genus of shrubs , surveyed contained RT sequences . The three species of V . sect . Hebe all contained RT sequences . Veronica salicifolia is a lowland forest species native to New Zealand and coastal Chile , V . dieffenbachii is endemic to the Chatham Islands and V . odora is a sub - alpine species . Stilbocarpa mosaic bacilliform virus was not detected in S . polaris collected from Auckland and Campbell Island ( no collections from Macquarie Island ) . None of AoB PLANTS 2011 plr008 doi : 10 . 1093 / aobpla / plr008 . , available online at www . aobplants . oxfordjournals . org & The Authors 2011 5 Lyttle et al . — Badnavirus RT sequences in the NZ ﬂora the Stilbocarpa plants showed symptoms of virus infec - tion and no RT sequences were ampliﬁed using the Haf primers or the primers of Skotnicki et al . ( 2003 ) . Melicytus ramiﬂorus was the only species sampled that displayed virus symptoms . Extensive electron micro - scope examination of M . ramiﬂorus sap , pellets prepared from extracts by differential centrifugation and ultrathin sections failed to detect any badnavirus particles . Par - ticles of an unidentiﬁed icosohedral virus were observed in healthy and symptomatic trees ( D . J . Lyttle and P . L . Guy , unpubl . res . ) . However , there was no correlation between the presence of RT sequence and virus symp - toms . The failure to ﬁnd particles with characteristic badnavirus morphology suggests that virus DNA is present only as integrated sequence . Virus particles were not detected in any of the prep - arations from the other species examined in the electron microscope . No mechanically transmissible viruses were detected during this study . Phylogenetic diversity of endogenous badnavirus sequences BLAST searching ( Altschul et al . 1997 ) showed that the sequences reported here did not match any known bad - navirus sequence . When the 21 RT DNA sequences from 12 species belonging to four genera ( Melicytus 17 , Coprosma 7 , Parsonsia 2 , Chionochloa 1 , Myrsine 1 ) were aligned with known badnavirus sequences from GenBank , each species was shown to contain distinct sequences ( Fig . 1 ) . With the exception of the Coprosma propinqua sequence , Coprosma sequences were monophyletic ( clade A , Fig . 1 ) with good bootstrap support . Another monophyletic group combined the M . alpinus and M . chathamicus sequences . All the M . ramiﬂorus sequences , with the exception of M . ramiﬂorus Wa6 , grouped together with strong bootstrap support . Melicytus ramiﬂorus and Melicytus ﬂexuosus sequences were less closely related . Two P . heterophylla sequences were closely related . Conservation of amino acid sequences in endogenous badnavirus RT All the endogenous badnavirus sequences that were determined were translated into the corresponding amino acid sequence and aligned . After duplicate sequences were removed , this gave a total of 21 distinct amino acid sequences . No frameshift mutations occurred in any of the sequences and a conservative pattern of amino acid changes was observed . Analysis of badnavirus RT sequence diversity from Melicytus Badnavirus RT sequences from the Melicytus spp . were investigated to determine the sequence diversity present within individual plants , among individuals of the same species and between different species in the genus . It was not possible to establish an unambiguous sequence directly from the PCR product for every collec - tion investigated as a number of the PCR products con - tained a heterogeneous mixture of sequences . These mixtures were subjected to DGGE to resolve the oligonu - cleotide fragments . The 530 bp RT fragment from M . ramiﬂorus was resolved into . 25 distinct bands by DGGE ( Fig . 2A ) . Overall , band patterns from different individuals were very similar in appearance and showed many bands in common . However , differences were apparent as some individuals contained additional bands or conversely lacked other bands . For example , the DGGE band pattern from a plant collected from Karamea ( lane 4 ) was similar though distinct from eastern coastal Otago plants ( lanes 2 , 3 ) although fewer bands were observed overall . A plant from Rangitoto Island , Auckland ( lane 6 ) showed three distinctive strong bands in the lower part of the gel but otherwise was similar to the remaining collections . Four plants collected from the same locality on the Otago Peninsula ( lanes 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ) showed indi - vidual differences but contained many common bands . There were no consistent differences in the band pat - terns from plants collected from the southern part of the South Island ( Dunedin ) , the northern part of the South Island ( Karamea ) and the northern part of the North Island ( Auckland ) that could be attributed to geo - graphic location . Inheritance of badnavirus fragment patterns Six plants grown from seed collected from a single parent ( Mel3 ) were compared in this analysis . As M . ramiﬂorus is a dioecious species only the female parent is known for this particular cross . Badnavirus frag - ment patterns for the female parent and the six progeny plants were generated using DGGE ( Fig . 2B ) . The progeny plants contained all the badnavirus fragments present in the maternal plant or a subset of them . Three seedlings , P1 , P3 and P5 , showed DGGE patterns identical to that of the parent . Each of the remaining three seedlings ( P2 , P4 and P6 ) all showed a subset of the parental bands . Analysis of variation in the M . alpinus species complex using badnavirus fragment patterns Analysis of badnavirus fragment patterns for the M . alpinus collections showed considerable variation within the species ( Fig . 3 ) .

DNA samples from the Swampy Summit plants ( 4 / 4 ) and Sandymount plants ( 2 / 2 ) did not amplify with the HafF and HafR primers . The remaining DNA samples all gave PCR products of the expected size . When the corre - sponding GC clamped primers were used for the ampliﬁ - cation of the RT fragment , the plants collected from the coastal sites ( Akatore Creek , Hooper’s Inlet , Nugget Point , Pyramids , Sandymount and Taiaroa Head ) and one inland site ( Middlemarch ) showed identical DGGE band proﬁles ( Fig . 3 , type 1 ) . Two of the inland plants , Pisa Range 1 and Ida Range , shared a second unique DGGE band proﬁle ( Fig . 3 , type 2 ) . The two remaining plants collected from the Pisa Range showed band pro - ﬁles that were different from each other and from the other two groups . The two specimens of M . chathamicus examined gave identical DGGE patterns ( results not shown ) . Congruence between host phylogeny and endogenous badnavirus proﬁles To clarify the phylogenetic relationships among the different species of Melicytus examined for badnavirus sequences in this study , the sequence of the ITS region was determined for 34 collections of various Melicytus spp . ( Table 2 ) using the primers ITS - 1 and ITS - 4 . Two major clades with weak support ( posterior prob - ability value 0 . 92 ) were resolved . One clade contained Fig . 2 .

The second comprised M . alpinus , M . ﬂexuosus and M . novae zelandiae from New Zealand and M . chathamicus ( Chatham Islands ) , M . latifolius ( Norfolk Island ) and M . dentatus ( South Australia ) . The two most geographically separated species , M . dentatus and M . chathamicus , had the most closely related sequences . In this analysis Melicytus obovatus ( Cook’s Strait ) , together with ﬁve specimens of M . alpinus collected from Sandymount and Swampy Summit near Dunedin , formed an unresolved basal polytomy . Plants from all three locations had identical ITS sequences . Although the small - leaved specimens were morphologically similar to M . alpinus , their ITS sequence and lack of RT sequence separates them from M . alpinus sensu stricto . Analysis of individual ITS sequences of Melicytus DNAs showed that two types of variation were present . Many DNA templates showed single - base polymorphisms ( Table 2 ) where the sequencing chromatograms showed alternate bases at a number of positions . This type of polymorphism was consistent in terms of nucleo - tide ratios at each position and was scored if it was observed in both the forward and reverse sequences for a given sample . A second polymorphism identiﬁed was the presence of an indel that caused nucleotide shifts giving overlapping peaks in the sequencing chro - matogram . Two different indels were initially identiﬁed as a character present in some species from the align - ment of all the Melicytus ITS sequences . The 3T indel occurred in sequences from M . ﬂexuosus , and the TGA indel occurred in sequences from the M . obovatus clade . The 3T indel was found as a hybrid polymorphism in a group of specimens collected from mainly coastal sites . The simplest hypothesis to account for the 3T indel poly - morphism is that the plants in which it occurs were orig - inally derived from hybrids between two pre - existing species . From the results of this study it is likely that the coastal clade of M . alpinus arose as a hybrid between M . alpinus sensu stricto ( alpId , alpPa3 and alpPa2 ) and M . ﬂexuosus . In the same manner we con - sider that the specimens Sw1 , Sw2 and Sw3 are likely to be of hybrid origin between an M . obovatus - like pro - genitor and M . ﬂexuosus which is still growing nearby . The predominant sequence from these plants shows a TGA indel characteristic of M . obovatus , but a lesser amount of the 3T indel of M . ﬂexuosus is also observed . In positions where the sequences of M . obovatus and M . ﬂexuosus diverge , the predominant base is that of M . obovatus and the minor base is from M . ﬂexuosus . The closely related plants Smt1 and Smt2 are isolated from any currently existing M . ﬂexuosus population and do not show the introgression of M . ﬂexuosus sequences . Each group shows a badna RT DGGE pattern that is entirely consistent with the ITS sequence data . Discussion In spite of its Gondwanan origins , many of New Zealand’s plant lineages are more recent arrivals ( Wink - worth et al . 2002 ) with many species but few genera being endemic . The New Zealand genera which con - tained RT sequences also occur in other regions : S . E . Asia , Papua New Guinea , Australia , New Zealand , Paciﬁc Islands , Sub Antarctic Islands and South America . Based on our results , we suggest that endogenous badnaviruses may be common in these regions . Melicytus dentatus collected in South Australia contained RT sequences . Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis proved a useful technique to analyse the sequence diversity present in many of the samples : cutting out individual bands and re - amplifying them led to additional sequence information . The most complex band pattern was found in M . ramiﬂorus . When PCR products from this species were analysed by DGGE , over 25 bands were observed in the majority of the samples . Some bands showed minor nucleotide changes but the amino acid sequence was conserved , while others showed additional nucleotide changes that resulted in ﬁve amino acid changes ( in silico ) . Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis has been used widely in environ - mental sampling to uncover the diversity of species within various ecosystems ( Singh et al . 2004 ; Bull and Stach 2007 ; Tannock 2008 ) , but this study shows that it is a useful technique to take a snapshot of the diversity within and between genomes . The presence of endogenous badnaviruses , often as multiple copies , in so many of the species tested and at high incidences , indicatesthatthey mayconfera selective advantage . One such advantage could be protection from infection by related viruses via RNA interference ( Covey and Al - Kaff 2000 ; Hull et al . 2000 ; Noreen et al . 2007 ) . Mul - tiple copies could have arisen by multiple integrations of badnaviruses into the host genome or by the single inte - gration of concatemers whose component sequences then diverged . Typical of island ﬂoras , there is a high inci - dence of polyploidy in New Zealand species ( Richards 1997 ) , which could further increase copy number ; however , recent studies with Nicotiana spp . ( Gregor et al . 2004 ; Skalicka´ et al . 2005 ) have shown selective deletion of repetitive sequences in some polyploids . The inheritance of endogenous badnavirus fragment patterns was investigated by examining plants grown from the seed of a single female plant of M . ramiﬂorus . Three DGGE band patterns were identical to that of the AoB PLANTS 2011 plr008 doi : 10 . 1093 / aobpla / plr008 . , available online at www . aobplants . oxfordjournals . org & The Authors 2011 11 Lyttle et al . — Badnavirus RT sequences in the NZ ﬂora maternal plant but 3 / 6 progeny contained only a subset of the maternal bands . There is strong presumptive evidence that many genera of New Zealand native woody plants including Melicytus reproduce by facultative apomixis ( B . P . J . Molloy , pers . comm . , 2008 ) and this has been shown deﬁnitively for the genus Coprosma ( Heenan et al . 2003 ) . The conservation of endogenous badnavirus DGGE band patterns in M . ramiﬂorus is consistent with the exist - ence of apomictic races that would give rise to additional variants whenever out - crossing occurs . The M . alpinus complex includes a diverse assem - blage of forms that encompasses a considerable amount of environmental and genetic variation , ranging from a low - growing spiny cushion , typical of the species , to shrubs and dwarf alpine forms growing in high - altitude screes . There are several unnamed shrubby taxa in the M . alpinus complex present in New Zealand ( Molloy and Clarkson 1996 ; Mitchell et al . 2009 ) . It is likely that apomixis also occurs in these small - leaved species and may be in part responsible for the existence of the bewildering array of forms found in the M . alpinus complex . The presence or absence of RT sequences and consistent differences in the RT fragment patterns were observed , and in con - junction with ITS sequences revealed that M . alpinus is composed of several distinct taxa . Integrated badnavirus sequences are diverse ( Geering et al . 2005 a , b ) and have undergone reassortment and given rise to infection during tissue culture ( Ndowora et al . 1999 ) . Recent work showed that the proliferation stage of micropropagation triggers the episomal replica - tion ( Dallot et al . 2001 ) . Wounding and various abiotic changes ( Lockhart et al . 2000 ; Richert - Po¨ggeler et al . 2003 ) are known to activate EPRVs and indeed other genomic sequences previously regarded as pseudogenes ( Summerﬁeld et al . 2008 ) . Considering the growing use of tissue culture and other biotechnologies for plant conser - vation ( Engelmann 1991 ; Harding et al . 1997 ; Harding 2004 ; Bapat et al . 2008 ) and the increasing prevalence of these ‘two - faced travellers in the plant genome’ ( Staginnus and Richert - Po¨ggeler 2006 ) , it now seems prudent to screen wild germplasm for endogenous bad - naviruses and other endogenous Caulimoviridae ( Geering et al . 2010 ) before tissue culture . Conclusions and forward look Although our preliminary focus was detecting badna - viruses and endogenous badnaviruses at large in the New Zealand ﬂora , the detection and analysis of badna - virus RT sequences in combination with DGGE were useful for much wider applications in plant systematics , phylogenetics and reproduction biology .
