Critchley 3 & Christoph Ballestrem 1 The link between extracellular - matrix - bound integrins and intracellular F - actin is essential for cell spreading and migration . Here , we demonstrate how the actin - binding proteins talin and vinculin cooperate to provide this link . By expressing structure - based talin mutants in talin null cells , we show that while the C - terminal actin - binding site ( ABS3 ) in talin is required for adhesion complex assembly , the central ABS2 is essential for focal adhesion ( FA ) maturation . Thus , although ABS2 mutants support cell spreading , the cells lack FAs , fail to polarize and exert reduced force on the surrounding matrix . ABS2 is inhibited by the preceding mechanosensitive vinculin - binding R3 domain , and deletion of R2R3 or expression of constitutively active vinculin generates stable force - independent FAs , although cell polarity is compromised . Our data suggest a model whereby force acting on integrin - talin complexes via ABS3 promotes R3 unfolding and vinculin binding , activating ABS2 and locking talin into an actin - binding conﬁguration that stabilizes FAs .

Cell migration involves the cyclical attachment and detachment of the integrin family of adhesion molecules to extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , as well as the generation of force required to translocate the cell body . Such events occur in focal adhesions ( FA ) , dynamic macromolecular complexes in which integrins are linked via cytoplasmic adhesion plaque proteins to the actomyosin contractile machinery 1 – 3 . Two plaque proteins that are key to this link are the interacting actin - binding proteins talin and vinculin . Cells depleted of talin cannot maintain cell spreading 4 , while cells without vinculin have smaller more dynamic FAs 1 – 3 , 5 , 6 and are compromised in coupling plaque proteins to F - actin 4 , 7 , 8 . Structurally , talin consists of an atypical N - terminal FERM - domain ( talin head ) that binds integrins , PIP2 and F - actin ( actin - binding site 1 ; ABS1 ) linked to a C - terminal ﬂexible rod consisting of 13 alpha - helical bundles ( R1 - R13 ) terminating in a dimerization motif ( Fig . 1a ) 9 . The rod contains binding sites for the Rap1 - interactor RIAM 10 , 11 , vinculin 12 and integrins 13 plus two additional regions that bind F - actin ( ABS2 and ABS3 ) 1 – 3 , 14 . Binding of the talin head to integrins regulates their afﬁnity for ECM 4 , 15 , while talin binding to actin is thought to form the primary link to the force - transmitting machinery 4 – 6 , 9 . Vinculin , which binds talin via its globular N - terminal head and F - actin via its C - terminal tail , acts as a molecular clutch , reinforcing the link between talin and actomyosin 7 , 8 , 10 , 16 , 17 . Moreover , vinculin binding to talin maintains integrins in an active conformation 9 , 11 , 16 , stabilizing the entire FA structure containing a large number of signalling components 10 , 11 , 16 . However , expression of constitutively active vinculin compromises cell polarity and directional cell migration 12 , 16 . Thus , co - ordinated cell migration requires that the activity of talin and vinculin are precisely controlled , but the mechanisms that regulate assembly of the talin / vinculin complex and its interaction with the cellular force machinery remain to be explored . The activity of talin and vinculin is regulated by conforma - tional changes at several levels . In both cases , the N - terminal head domains interact with the C - terminal regions of the proteins resulting in an autoinhibited state 7 – 9 , 18 . Despite evidence that activation involves either chemical signals ( binding to activating proteins or lipids ) and / or physical force 9 , 10 , 19 , the detailed mechanisms underlying activation have not been elucidated . In addition , structural and biochemical studies on talin show that the vinculin binding sites ( VBSs ) within the helical bundles that make up the talin rod are cryptic 12 , 14 , 20 – 22 , and single molecule experiments 9 , 23 – 25 indicate that force - induced unfolding of the bundles is required to unmask the VBSs . Thus , it is hypothesised that force - induced conformational changes in talin lead to the recruitment of vinculin and the stabilization of FAs . However , to what extent such mechanisms operate in cells is unclear . Structure – function studies on talin have been hampered by the fact that ( i ) most cell types express two structurally and functionally related talin isoforms 26 , 27 , ( ii ) knockout or knockdown of talin1 leads to upregulation of talin2 4 and ( iii ) knockdown leaves residual talin 4 , 28 , complicating the interpretation of results . Here , we use newly derived talin1 and talin2 knockout ( TKO ) cells that grow in suspension , and only adhere to ECM , spread and assemble FAs following expression of functional talin constructs . By reconstituting TKO cells with structure - based talin point and deletion mutants , we deﬁne the role of speciﬁc talin and vinculin domains in engaging the actomyosin machinery , the assembly and stability of FAs , and the establish - ment of cell polarity . We demonstrate that vinculin binding within domains R2R3 acts to ‘unlock’ ABS2 of talin , and that this is regulated either by prior activation of vinculin , or by the application of force across talin provided by actin - binding to ABS3 . These ﬁndings demonstrate how talin , vinculin and actin interact with one another to form the major mechanosensory module of the FA . Results Talin regulates FA size and cell polarity . To investigate how the 11 potential VBSs in the talin rod 12 contribute to FA formation , we deleted rod domains containing either 4 ( tal D R4 - R10 ) or 9 ( tal D R1 - R10 ) of the VBSs ( Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . These constructs were tagged with GFP and expressed in TKO cells , which lack endogenous talin ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) and do not adhere to ECM and do not spread ( Fig . 1b ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) 4 . Expression of GFP - tagged full - length talin ( talinFL ) rescued integrin activation ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) , cell adhesion , spreading and FA formation ( Fig . 1b , c ) , and cells displayed both small peripheral adhesions and mature FAs connected to prominent actin stress ﬁbres . In contrast , although the talin rod deletion mutants rescued integrin activation and spreading , the cells lacked large FAs ( Fig . 1c ; Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Tal D R1 - R10 cells displayed mostly small peripheral adhesions , and while tal D R4 - R10 cells assembled slightly larger structures ( Fig . 1d ) , both generally lacked actin stress ﬁbres , although adhesions were connected to thin actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 1c ; Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . Moreover , cells expressing these mutants were largely unpolarized ( Fig . 1e ) , and cell motility was reduced compared with talinFL cells ( Fig . 1f ) ; cell polarization is a prerequisite for directional migration . Vinculin , which binds talin and actin , is important for full engagement of adhesion complexes with the force machinery 8 , 16 . Thus , the small peripheral adhesions exhibited by tal D R1 - R10 and tal D R4 - R10 cells might result from reduced vinculin - binding . Indeed , we observed a twofold reduction in the vinculin / talin ratio in tal D R4 - R10 cells , and a ﬁvefold reduction in tal D R1 - R10 cells compared with talinFL cells ( Fig . 1g , h ) . We conclude that both talin R1 - R3 and R4 - R10 contain functional VBSs that recruit vinculin to FAs . The presence of vinculin in talin D R1 - R10 adhesions likely indicates that the two VBSs in R11 - R13 are also functional , as proposed by others 28 , 29 . Talin domains R1 - R3 contain key vinculin binding sites . Inhibition of actomyosin - mediated tension with Rho Kinase ( ROCK ) or myosin inhibitors normally results in FA dis - assembly 16 . By binding to talin , constitutively active full - length vinculin ( vinT12 ) stabilises FAs which become insensitive to such drugs 7 , 16 . To investigate which talin rod domains are key to this effect , talinFL or the talin deletion mutants were co - expressed with either full - length vinculin ( vinFL ) or vinT12 , and the cells treated with Y - 27632 . As the talin deletion mutants do not support FA maturation in TKO cells , we used NIH3T3 cells for these experiments ( endogenous talin supports FA formation which become GFP - talin positive ; Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . As expected , Y - 27632 reduced the size of GFP - talinFL positive FAs while vinT12 stabilized FAs ( Fig . 2a ) . The intensity of GFP - talinFL in FAs also decreased more than in cells co - expressing vinT12 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . Interestingly , while vinT12 also stabilized tal D R4 - R10 in FAs to a signiﬁcant degree , it had no effect on tal D R1 - R10 ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , suggesting that binding of vinculin to the R1 - R3 region of the talin rod is particularly important for adhesion stability . Vinculin - induced FA stabilization goes alongside reduced talin turnover 7 , 30 . To investigate the turnover of talinFL and the deletion mutants , we used talin constructs tagged with ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms10038 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 6 : 10038 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms10038 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications photoactivatable - GFP ( PAGFP ) and assessed ﬂuorescence loss after photoactivation ( FLAP ; for details see Supplementary Fig . 3b and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . The results showed that the rates of turnover of tal D R4 - R10 and tal D R1 - R10 were signiﬁcantly faster than talinFL ( Fig . 2b , c ; Supplementary Fig . 3c ; Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Co - expressing vinT12 signiﬁcantly decreased turnover of talinFL , and to some extent tal D R4 - R10 , but not the tal D R1 - R10 mutant ( Fig . 2b , c ; Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . These results were conﬁrmed using FRAP ( Supplementary Fig . 3d ) .

This construct had no effect on talinFL turnover as assessed by FLAP ( Supplementary Fig . 3e and Supplementary Movie 4 ) . These results clearly indicate that binding of active vinculin to the R1 - R3 region of the talin rod plays an important role in stabilizing FAs . D R2R3 suppresses FA dynamics independently of vinculin . Four out of the ﬁve VBSs in talin R1 - R3 are in R2R3 ( Fig . 1a ) . We therefore expected that TKO cells expressing a tal D R2R3 construct ( Fig . 3a ) would have smaller and less stable FAs . To our surprise , they were even larger than FAs in talinFL cells , although the cells were more rounded ( Fig . 3b , c ) . All FAs in tal D R2R3 cells were linked to prominent actin stress ﬁbres ( Fig . 3b ) , and strikingly , the FAs remained stable when treated with Y - 27632 ( Fig . 3d and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Comparable results were seen in NIH3T3 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Co - expression of vinT12 with tal D R2R3 caused no further increase in FA stability ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Moreover , FLAP experiments showed that tal D R2R3 turnover was greatly diminished compared with talinFL ( Fig . 3e and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . As expected , FAs in tal D R2R3 cells had a signiﬁcantly reduced vinculin to talin ratio compared with control cells ( Fig . 3f and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Furthermore , tal D R2R3 exhibited reduced turnover even when expressed in vinculin null cells ( Fig . 3g ) . Clearly , the stabilizing effect induced by deleting talin R2R3 is vinculin independent . A role for talin ABS2 in FA dynamics . One possibility is that deletion of R2R3 may activate the adjacent actin - binding site ( ABS2 ) originally mapped to residues 951 – 1327 ( ref . 14 ) ( roughly equivalent to R4 - R6 ) . However , R7R8 has also now been shown to bind F - actin 21 . To map ABS2 more precisely , we expressed several new talin rod fragments designed according to domain boundaries . Talin R4 - R8 co - sedimented with F - actin ( Fig . 4a ) to about the same extent as ABS1 in the talin head and ABS3 in the C - terminal R13 rod domain . Interestingly , R1 - R3 and R9 - R12 also co - sedimented with F - actin , though to a lesser degree , a b c 0 100 200 300 0 . 0 Time ( s ) 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y TalinFL Δ R4 - R10 Δ R4 - R10 Δ R1 - R10 Δ R1 - R10 TalinFL C on t r o l V i n T 12 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 A dhe s i on s i z e ( μ m 2 ) T a li n F L un t r ea t ed Δ R 4 - R 10 Δ R 1 - R 10 + Y - 27632 T a li n F L Control + vinT12 * * * * * * NS T a li n F L Untreated Δ R1 - R10 Δ R4 - R10 Y - 27632 TalinFL C on t r o l + v i n T 12 TalinFL Δ R1 - R10 Δ R4 - R10 0 50 100 150 200 250 t ½ F L AP ( s ) Control + vinT12 N / D * * * Figure 2 | Vinculin regulates talin by binding to R1 - R3 domains .

To explore the possibility that domains ﬂanking ABS2 might inﬂuence its activity , we designed ABS2 constructs containing the adjacent R3 and R9 domains . Interestingly , inclusion of these domains either together ( R3 - R9 ) or individually ( R4 - R9 or R3 - R8 ) actually reduced actin binding to ABS2 ( Fig . 4b ) . These results indicate that domains ﬂanking ABS2 suppress its activity , and suggest that conformational changes in these domains have the potential to activate ABS2 . a b c d e Δ R2R3 Actin binding site Vinculin binding site Talin rod domain 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 A dhe s i on s i z e ( μ m 2 ) * * * FL Δ R2R3 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 0 5 10 15 N u m be r o f c e ll s Circularity FL Δ R2R3 FERM R1 R4 R5 R6 R7 R9 R10 R11 R12 R13 DD R8 0 50 100 150 t ½ F L AP ( s ) N / D T a li n F L Δ R 2 R 3 0 100 200 300 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Time ( s ) N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y TalinFL Δ R2R3 TalinFL Δ R2R3 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 A dhe s i on s i z e ( μ m 2 ) Untreated * * * Y - 27632 TalinFL Δ R2R3 + 50 μ M Y - 27632 g f Δ R 2 R 3 0 50 100 150 t ½ F L AP ( s ) * * * * * * Δ R 4 - R 10 Δ R 1 - R 10 T a li n F L N / D 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) TalinFL Δ R4 - R10 Δ R1 - R10 Δ R2R3 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y Vin – / – MEFs 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 T a li n F L Δ R 2 R 3 * * * M ean v i n c u li n : t a li n r a t i o Δ R 2 R 3 Actin T a li n F L GFP Figure 3 | Deletion of Talin R2R3 stabilises FAs .

Both R4 and the R7R8 double domain bound F - actin ( the latter is consistent with previous results 21 ) . In contrast , R5 and R6 bound only weakly if at all to F - actin , and previous studies have shown that R7 alone does not bind actin 21 . The results indicate that R4 and R8 are the key determinants of ABS2 , and perhaps bind cooperatively to F - actin . Both domains have anomalously high pI values ( 9 . 5 and 7 . 8 , respectively ) compared with an average pI of 5 . 4 for the talin rod , and will be positively charged at physiological pH as required for binding to the negatively charged surface of F - actin . High pI values are also observed for ABS1 and ABS3 ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Analysis of the distribution of conserved positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids in the R4 and R8 domain structures highlights a number of residues that may contribute to actin binding . By serially mutating these residues ( Fig . 4d ) , a R4 - R8 construct with reduced ability to bind F - actin ( B 60 % inhibition ) was generated ( B . Goult and M . Schwartz personal communica - tion ) . A GFP - tagged talinFL ABS2mut containing these mutations rescued cell spreading in TKO cells , but the FAs were smaller and the number of actin stress ﬁbres markedly reduced compared with talinFL cells ( Fig . 4e ; for quantiﬁcation Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Furthermore , FLAP experiments showed that turnover of talinFL ABS2mut was signiﬁcantly faster than talinFL and similar results were obtained by deleting the R8 domain ( Fig . 4f and Supplementary Movie 7 , Supplementary Fig . 7c and Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Both talinFL and talinFL ABS2mut were stabilized by co - expression of vinT12 ; however , it had a less pronounced effect on talinFL ABS2mut . Thus , ABS2 is an important factor determining talin turnover in FAs . ABS2 - actin and vinculin - actin regulate talin dynamics . To test whether the stabilizing effects of tal D R2R3 are dependent on ABS2 , we expressed a tal D R2R3 ABS2mut mutant in TKO cells . The construct rescued cell spreading , but the cells had much smaller FAs and lacked the prominent F - actin stress ﬁbres seen with the tal D R2R3 construct ( Fig . 5a ) . Furthermore , using FLAP , we found that the tal D R2R3 ABS2mut had a sig - niﬁcantly faster turnover than tal D R2R3 ( Fig . 5b and Supplementary Movie 8 ) demonstrating that the stabilizing effects of tal D R2R3 are indeed partly mediated through ABS2 . a e f b d R5 R6 R7 R8 R4 K922E Q923E Q930E R1500E R1510E K1522E Actin binding site 2 A c t i n ( 10 μ M ) T a li n ( 4 μ M ) S P S P S P S P S P F 0 – F 3 R 1 – R 3 R 4 – R 8 R 9 – R 12 R 13 – D D * * * 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 N o r m a li z ed i n t e s n i t y 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) FL Control FL ABS2mut VinT12 FL ABS2mut Control FL VinT12 F L ABS 2 m u t Actin GFP T a li n F L * * * TalinFL FL ABS2mut * * ControlVinT12 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 N / D t 1 / 2 F L AP ( s ) c S P S P S P S P A c t i n ( 10 μ M ) Talin ( 4 μ M ) R4 – R8 R3 – R9 R4 – R9 R3 – R8 60 40 89 11 89 11 82 18 A c t i n ( 10 μ M ) S P S P S P S P T a li n ( 4 μ M ) R4 R5 R7 – R8 R6 Figure 4 | ABS2 is a key regulator of talin .

To establish whether this is also a factor regulating talinFL turnover , we used a vinT12 I997A mutant with reduced actin - binding and bundling activity 8 . The vinT12 I997A construct still produced a signiﬁcant reduction in the turnover of talinFL , but the reduction was not as great as with vinT12 ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Movie 9 ) . Altogether , these experiments strongly suggest that actin binding to talin ABS2 contributes to FA stabilization , and that this is regulated by vinculin binding to R2R3 . However , the ability of vinculin to bind directly to both talin and F - actin also plays a signiﬁcant role . Talin - actin link is required for traction force generation . The link between the adhesion plaque and actomyosin is essential to generate the forces required for cell migration . To investigate the role of talin in this process , we used TKO cells expressing various talin mutants , and traction force microscopy to examine force transmission to substrate . The largest traction stresses detected were at the cell periphery , where the majority of adhesion complexes are localized ( Fig . 6 ) . Highest traction stresses were observed in talinFL and tal D R2R3 cells , while cells expressing talin ABS2 deletion or point mutants exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced force transmission ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Quantiﬁcation showed that cells expressing tal D R2R3 were able to exert similar forces on the ECM to cells expressing talinFL ( Fig . 6a , b ) . In contrast , cells expressing tal D R4 - R10 or tal D R1 - R10 , which lack ABS2 and several VBSs , showed a 45 and 55 % reduction respectively in the force transmitted to ECM ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Similarly , TKO cells expressing talinFL ABS2mut displayed a 50 % weaker force exertion than cells expressing talinFL ( Fig . 6c ) . These data clearly demonstrate that ABS2 plays a key role in actomyosin - mediated force transmission . Talin ABS3 is required for FA initiation and cell spreading . While the above experiments demonstrate a key role for ABS2 in FA maturation and engagement with the actomyosin machinery , the role of ABS3 has remained unclear . One hypothesis , largely derived from in vitro experiments , is that ABS3 might support the initial force transduction that is required to unravel the R2R3 helical bundles , and promote vinculin binding . If this were the case , one would expect that abolishing actin binding to ABS3 would result in a failure to form stable adhesions . To test this hypothesis , we used a talinFL KVK / DDD mutation that reduces actin binding to ABS3 by 4 70 % , without affecting dimerization which is essential for actin binding 22 . Interestingly , while the GFP - tagged talinFL KVK / DDD mutant rescued TKO cell spreading , B 45 % of cells lacked FAs ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Moreover , in the majority of cells , GFP - talinFL KVK / DDD showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution with no clear localization to actin ﬁlaments , unlike constructs with an intact ABS3 . These experiments suggest that F - actin binding to ABS3 supports the force required for the initial events leading to FA formation . However , about half of talinFL KVK / DDD cells contained some FAs ( Fig . 7a , b ) . These cells exerted weaker traction forces , migrated slower and contained less vinculin in FAs compared with cells expressing talinFL ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . However , the fact that they had clearly visible FAs suggested that FA initiation via ABS3 can be bypassed . We therefore tested whether activated vinculin , which in turn activates ABS2 , and can itself bind directly to F - actin , might bypass ABS3 . Indeed , we found that co - expression of vinT12 with the talinFL KVK / DDD mutant was able to fully rescue FA formation , unlike co - expression of vinT12 A50I ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Together , our data demonstrate that ABS3 plays a key role in the initiation of FA assembly , but that its role can be bypassed by pathways that activate vinculin and allow the association between vinculin and talin . a b 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 M ean F A s i z e ( μ m 2 ) * * * Δ R 2 R 3 Δ R 2 R 3 ABS 2 m u t 0 50 100 150 t 1 / 2 F L AP ( s ) N / D Δ R 2 R 3 Δ R 2 R 3 ABS 2 m u t c 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 N o r m a li z ed i n t e s n i t y Δ R2R3 Δ R2R3 ABS2mut 0 100 200 300 Time ( s ) 0 100 200 300 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Time ( s ) N o r m a li z ed i n t e s n i t y FL Control FL + VinT12 FL + VinT12 I997A C on t r o l V i n T 12 V i n T 1 2 I 9 97 A 0 50 100 150 200 250 t 1 / 2 F L AP ( s ) * * * N / D Δ R 2 R 3 ABS 2 m u t Δ R 2 R 3 GFP Actin 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 0 5 10 15 Circularity N u m be r o f c e ll s Δ R2R3 Δ R2R3 ABS2mut Figure 5 | Talin R2R3 regulate the availability of ABS2 for actin binding .

Talin is seen early in adhesion complex assembly 37 , binds and activates integrins 38 , 39 and regulates the recruitment of other proteins including vinculin , paxillin and FAK to FAs 4 , 28 , 40 . Using TKO cells , we demonstrate that talin is indeed essential for integrin activation , cell adhesion and spreading , and is at the core of adhesion complex assembly , the regulation of adhesion strength and engagement with actin . TKO cells expressing a talin ABS3 mutant ( talinFL KVK / DDD ) 22 exhibit a marked reduction in assembly of adhesion clusters suggesting that in the absence of ABS3 - mediated coupling to actomyosin , the force - dependent conformational changes in talin required to expose cryptic VBSs and to activate ABS2 are inoperative . As a result , adhesion complexes that do form are unstable . ABS3 may also be involved in the correct localization of talin , bringing it into position to bind and activate integrins and initiate adhesion complex assembly 41 . Such a model is suggested by our ﬁnding that the talinFL KVK / DDD mutant showed little enrichment in actin - rich lamellipodia ( Fig . 7a ) compared with constructs with an intact ABS3 ( Fig . 1c ) . However , the role of talin ABS3 in adhesion assembly can be bypassed by constitutively active vinculin , suggesting that pathways that activate endogenous vinculin may also drive complex assembly . Consistent with this , the muscle - detachment phenotype caused by expressing a talin ABS3 mutant during Drosophila embryogenesis was partially rescued by vinculin 42 . To date , the role of ABS2 in the central part of the talin rod has been ignored . Here we establish that talin ABS2 ( R4 - R8 ) is essential for stabilization of FA complexes , and for the generation of maximal traction force ( Figs 4 and 6 ) . Our biochemical experiments indicate that domains ﬂanking ABS2 suppress its activity ( Fig . 4c ) , suggesting that talin must undergo a conformational change that relieves this inhibitory effect . Since the talinFL KVK / DDD mutation inhibits FA assembly ( Fig . 7a ) , it seems likely that activation of ABS2 is initially regulated by engagement of ABS3 with actomyosin . However , the fact that the talinFL KVK / DDD phenotype is rescued by vinT12 suggests addi - tional regulation of ABS2 by vinculin binding to R3 ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Indeed , our experiments with talin rod deletion mutants show that the VBSs in the R1 - R3 domains are particularly important for FA stabilization , and magnetic tweezer experiments demonstrate that ( i ) force unmasks the VBSs in R2R3 ( ref . 16 ) and ( ii ) that R3 is the initial mechanosensing domain unfolding at B 5pN ( refs 24 , 43 ) . This conclusion is consistent with structural data which shows that while R2 is stabilized by R1 ( ref . 10 ) , R3 is the least stable of the three domains because of the presence of four threonine residues buried within its hydrophobic core 10 , 24 . Based on these results , we postulate that the initial association between talin ABS3 and actin provides sufﬁcient force to overcome the 5 pN threshold to unfold the talin R3 helical bundle . This allows vinculin to bind to R3 , relieving the inhibitory effect of R3 on ABS2 which then binds F - actin , reinforcing the link with the actomyosin machinery , leading to adhesion maturation . When the initial force acting on talin ABS3 is insufﬁcient to unfold the R3 domain , binding of vinculin is suppressed , ABS2 is not activated and the complex disas - sembles , as seen in short - lived nascent adhesions 36 . Ratiometric imaging with talin deletion mutants and vinculin ( Figs 3f and 1h ) shows that the R2R3 , R4 - R10 and the C - terminal R11 - R13 talin rod domains can all bind vinculin in vivo , conﬁrming in vitro data of multiple VBSs along the talin rod 12 . Data demonstrating that activated vinculin stabilizes talin mutants containing talin R2R3 and R4 - R10 domains in FAs , and the FA structure itself ( Fig . 2a , b ) indicates that vinculin drives adhesion assembly through binding to VBSs in these domains .

These observations , together with the previously reported force mediated recruitment of vinculin to FAs 16 , 25 , 44 , and the increased ratio of vinculin / talin during FA maturation 45 , suggest that a gradual increase of force induces vinculin to bind to different sites in talin , thus strengthening the connectivity between the adhesion complex and the cytoskeleton . This additional mode of regulation through vinculin , whose own activity can be regulated by actomyosin - mediated forces , adds a regulatory module which appears key for the cell to respond to changes in the mechanical environment 16 . We propose the following two - step model for talin activation and adhesion maturation which is key for co - ordinated force transduction and polarized cell migration ( Fig . 8 ) . Initially , talin , the bulk of which exists in an autoinhibited form in the cytosol 46 , 47 , is recruited to the plasma membrane , the actin - rich lamellipodium and adhesion sites through pathways involving actin binding to ABS3 , or its interaction with RIAM , integrins , PIP 2 , exosomes 48 and FAK 49 – 52 . Whether kindlin , which appears to precede talin in nascent adhesions 45 , is involved in recruiting talin is unclear . At the leading edge , the talin head - rod auto - inhibitory interaction is disrupted possibly by PIP2 ( ref . 50 ) , and talin synergises with kindlins to activate integrins 9 leading to the formation of nascent adhesions . Subsequently , actomyosin - mediated tension across talin , bound to integrins at one end and actin via ABS3 at the other , leads to unfolding of the R3 helical bundle relieving inhibition of ABS2 and exposing the two high afﬁnity VBSs in R3 , which can bind vinculin 16 , 24 . Vinculin may prevent refolding of R3 locking ABS2 into an active state . The combined link of talin ABS2 and ABS3 to F - actin and the ability of vinculin to cross - link talin to actin stabilises talin in the adhesion complex . This hypothesis is supported by the recently published ﬁndings that talin engaged with F - actin at FAs is under tension , and is stretched and positioned by this F - actin linkage , thus orchestrating the molecular architecture of the FA 53 . Further increases in myosin - II mediated force generation may subsequently activate additional VBSs localized along the talin rod leading to recruitment of more vinculin molecules , resulting in the maximal stabilization of the overall FA structure . The fact that vinT12 can bypass the role of talin ABS3 in FA assembly , suggests that pathways that activate vinculin ( for example , via PIP2 ( refs 54 , 55 ) ) may also drive FA assembly . FAs then act as signalling hubs controlling many aspects of cell behaviour including polarity and migration . Methods Cell lines and transfections . NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts and vinculin (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s med - ium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FCS , 1 % L - glutamine and 1 % non - essential amino acids . For the generation of talin1 and talin2 knock out cells , cells were isolated from the collecting ducts of 5 – 6 - weeks - old talin1 ﬂox / ﬂox mice / talin2 null mice 56 as described by Husted et al . 57 and immortalized with pSV40 plasmid .

Images were acquired with a CoolSnap HQ camera ( Photometrics ) . Image analysis and ratio imaging . Image analysis was carried out using Fiji - ImageJ ( version 1 . 48d ) software . For all constructs , we analysed cells with low to intermediate expression levels of talin . Expression levels were determined by ﬂuorescence intensities measured across a large number of cells / FAs in cells exposed to the same amounts of ﬂuorescent light ( exposure time below 500ms ) . Adhesion size measurements were performed using the particle analysis function of imageJ after careful background subtraction 7 . For cell circularity measurements , a freehand region of interest was drawn and circularity was measured . Cells were classiﬁed as being either ‘circular’ or ‘elongated’ as has been described previously , where elongated cells have a circularity Z 0 . 56 ( ref . 10 ) . For ratio imaging experiments , all images were acquired using the same exposure times . Ratio images were created using custom software ; brieﬂy , background noise was removed by thresholding , followed by division of the vinculin immunoﬂuorescence image by the GFP - talin image . For ratio quantiﬁcation , GFP - talin and vinculin immunoﬂuorescence images were background subtracted , a region of interest was drawn around individual , peripheral adhesions ( 7 per cell ) and the integrated density was measured for both channels . A ratio value was produced for each adhesion by dividing the values from vinculin images by talin images . Fluorescence loss after photoactivation ( FLAP ) . Cells co - expressing the PAGFP - tagged protein of interest and the appropriate mCherry - tagged marker were plated onto ﬁbronectin - coated glass bottom dishes . Both plasmids where expressed in a 1 : 1 ratio ( cells were transfected with 1 m g of each ) and only cells of healthy appearance with low to intermediate levels of the mCherry plasmid were selected for FLAP experiments . One hour before imaging , DMEM was replaced with Ham’s F - 12 medium supplemented with 25mM HEPES buffer , 2 % FCS , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin and 1 % L - glutamine . Cells were allowed to equilibrate in a pre - warmed environment at 37 (cid:2) C with 5 % CO 2 . Experiments were performed on a spinning disk confocal microscope ( CSU10 , Tokogawa ) supplied by Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Inc . ( 3i ) , equipped with a 60 (cid:3) / 1 . 42 Plan Apo oil immersion objective ( Zeiss ) . To photoactivate , a 405 - nm laser was pulsed at full power for 5ms at user - deﬁned regions of interest . Fluorescence images were captured in 10s intervals for a total period of 5min using 488 - nm and 561 - nm laser lines used at full power with an appropriate exposure time . Approximately 4 – 5 FAs within a similar region of the cell were selected . To obtain intensity values over time , photoactivated ﬂuorescence ( PAF ) images in the 488 - nm channel were processed using a custom MATLAB ( The Mathworks ) script . Brieﬂy , a user - deﬁned threshold is used to detect FAs and create a mask . The mean intensity within each mask is measured and recorded . A second user - deﬁned region is used to obtain background values , which are subtracted from the adhesion intensity values .

Fibronectin ( FN ) coated polyacrylamide ( PAA ) gels ( 6 % of gel diluted from 30 % Protogel in PBS , 37 . 5 : 1 ﬁxed ratio of arylamide / bis - acrylamide ; EC - 890 , National Diagnostics ) containing 1 : 100 dilution of 0 . 2 m m FluoSpheres carboxylate - modiﬁed microspheres ( F8805 , blue ﬂuorescent ( 365 / 415 ) , Life Technologies ) were prepared using previously published methods with modiﬁcations 60 , 61 . The stiffness ( 8 . 760 ± 0 . 209kPa ) of 6 % PAA gels were measured with a CellHesion Atomic Force Microscope ( Nanowizard , CellHesion 200 ; JPK Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) with tip - less cantilevers ( NP - O10 , Bruker AFM Probes ) modiﬁed by attaching 10 m m diameter polystyrene beads ( PPS - 10 . 0 , Kisker ) . Transfected cells were plated on gels and allowed to spread overnight . Cell spreading deformed the surfaces of the gels thus changing the position of the embedded beads . Fluorescence images of the embedded beads were captured on a Delta Vision microscope system ( Applied Precision , Washington , USA ) using an oil immersion (cid:3) 60 ( NA ¼ 1 . 42 ) objective . After taking bead images , 0 . 05 % Triton X100 was added to detach the cells and thus release forces mediated by cells on the gel . Subsequently , images of bead positions under null cellular forces were obtained as reference images . The traction forces exerted by cells were analysed by measuring the bead displacement induced by cells ; i . e . bead position changes of reference image and image with cells . Traction force analysis was performed using a MATLAB algorithm 62 . Bead displacement was calculated using cross - correlation between both bead images ( before and after Triton X100 treatment ) . The corresponding gel deformation was obtained by two - dimensional Gaussian interpolation . The stress ﬁeld ( Pa ) was calculated from the gel deformation by implementing a Fourier transform - based algorithm using the Boussinesq Green’s function . The total force ( nN ) was the sum of all overall traction forces exerted from one single cell . Protein expression and puriﬁcation . Talin constructs were synthesized by PCR using a mouse talin1 cDNA as template , and cloned into pET - 151 / D - TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . Constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Star ( DE3 ) cul - tured in LB . Recombinant His - tagged talin polypeptides were puriﬁed by nickel - afﬁnity chromatography following standard procedures 63 . The His - tag was removed by cleavage with AcTEV protease ( Invitrogen ) , and the protein was further puriﬁed by anion - exchange chromatography . Concentration was determined using extinction coefﬁcients at 280nm . Recombinant His - tagged chicken vinculin domain 1 ( Vd1 ; residues 1 – 258 ) was expressed from a pET - 15b plasmid and puriﬁed via nickel - afﬁnity chromatography followed by anion - exchange chromatography , as described by 20 . Actin co - sedimentation assays . Rabbit skeletal muscle G - actin 64 was polymerized in 10mM Tris , 50mM NaCl , 100 m M ATP , 1mM DTT , 1mM MgCl2 , pH 7 . 0 . Assays were performed using 4 m M talin polypeptides and 10 m M F - actin . The mixture was incubated for 60min at room temperature and centrifuged at 100 , 000r . p . m . for 30min at 22 (cid:2) C using a Beckman Optima TM ultracentrifuge . Supernatants and pellets were analysed on 12 % SDS – PAGE gels and stained using Coomassie blue . FACS Analysis of integrin activation . The level of b 1 integrin activation was measured by staining cells with the 9EG7 monoclonal antibody ( 553715 , BD Biosciences ) and ﬂuorescence activated cell sorting ( FACS ) . Cells ( 10 6 / tube ) were washed and re - suspended in FACS buffer ( 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA : A9647 , Sigma ) in PBS ) , incubated with 9EG7 diluted in FACS buffer for 1h on ice and then washed in the same buffer three times . Cells were then incubated with DyLight 649 conjugated donkey anti - rat ( Jackson lmmunoResearch ) diluted in FACS buffer for 45min on ice before two washes with FACS buffer , and a ﬁnal wash with PBS . FACS analysis was carried out by using Cyan ADP ( Beckman Coulter ) and Summit software ( V4 . 3 , Beckman ) . References 1 . Wehrle - Haller , B . Assembly and disassembly of cell matrix adhesions .
