The Changing Impact of Geographic Distance : A Preliminary Analysis on the Co - author Networks in Scientometrics ( 1983 - 2013 ) Xiao Liang Department of Informatics University at Albany , SUNY xliang @ albany . edu Abstract Geographic distance impact is an issue that has been discussed by scholars for years . The intent of this paper is to investigate the changing pattern of this impact . Moreover , since the development of Information Communication Technologies ( ICTs ) can affect remote scholarly collaboration , the author also examines its relationship with the changing pattern . The author uses the Exponential Random Graph Model ( ERGM ) to study the co - author networks in Scientometrics , which is a peer - reviewed journal in the field of Information Science . The result shows that the negative impact of the distance tends to decrease over time . Moreover , the trend of such an impact is somehow coincidental with the development of ICTs . 1 . Introduction Research shows distance is always an impact factor to scholarly collaborations [ 12 , 16 , 21 ] . Given the development of ICTs , the situation becomes complex . On one hand , technologies enable scholars to collaborate across areas and countries [ 14 ] ; on the other hand , problems caused by the long distance cannot be altogether conquered by the development of technologies such as ICTs [ 16 , 35 ] . Given this complexity , has the distance effect been lessened over time ? This question has not been answered very well from a statistical perspective since most of the studies in this area are “descriptive [ 16 ] ” . This paper tries to answer this question by analyzing co - authorship networks year by year in order to trace the impact curve of geographic distance . Beside the question of lessening , it must also be asked : does the changing impact of distance relate with the development of ICTs ? Since there are always other factors affecting the remote collaboration , such as research policies and the development of transportation technologies [ 16 , 46 , 47 ] , the impact of ICTs are rarely statistically separated from other factors [ 46 ] . The author tries to solve this problem by dividing the timeline into intervals according to the development of ICT and its impact to scholarly collaboration . After that , the author compares the impact of the distance by the intervals , trying to discover whether the trend of the impact is coincidental with the development of ICTs . ERGM is applied here to separate the effect of an author’s personal social relationship from the impact of the distance . A better understanding of such trend is important because , without such information , the impact of ICTs on overall scholarly collaborations is vague . Moreover , this research provides a start point for the further investigating of the specific reason for such a trend . This paper also enriches the literature of using ERGMs to study co - author relationships , which is still a new area . In the rest part of this paper , the author first briefly discusses the literature on the relationship between the distance and the scholarly collaboration . Based on the literature , the research questions are raised . After that , the author introduces ERGMs . The co - author networks derived from the journal Scientometrics are used for answering the research questions . Finally , the author defines time intervals according to the development of ICTs , and compares the distance impact across these intervals . 2 . Literature review and the research questions In this section the author reviews the literature about the distance and the scholarly collaboration . The author also briefly discusses the effect of geographical position and ICTs to the scholarly collaboration . Finally , based on the literature , the author proposes the research questions . 2 . 1 . Has the impact of the distance been lessened over time ? Research shows that the impact of the distance always exists in scholarly collaborations . For instance , Cronin studied Rob Kling’s personal co - author 2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 1530 - 1605 / 15 $ 31 . 00 © 2015 IEEE DOI 10 . 1109 / HICSS . 2015 . 92 722 network from the years 1976 to 2005 . Kling’s most prominent co - authors were of ten “ locally sourced [ 4 ] ” . Cornin also examined his personal egocentric co - author network . The findings showed that most of the close and frequent coauthors were from his home site [ 4 ] . By examining a co - authorship network derived from the publication of an interdisciplinary and multi - institutional research group , Rodriguez and Pepe found that co - authorship was highly correlated with department and institutional affiliations [ 35 ] . Other research also indicates or mentions that scientific collaborations are clustered in space [ 11 , 12 , 16 , 21 ] . Such a phenomenon is called as spatial biases [ 12 ] . However , with the facilitation of ICTs , scientific collaborations are not entirely constrained by geographical positions [ 16 , 27 , 43 ] . Based on this fact , scholars began to take into account both the spatial biases and the lessened impact of the distance . [ 9 , 15 , 28 , 36 ] . For instance , Hoekman , Frenken , and Tijssen investigated the changing spatial pattern of the co - author network in Europe in the period of 2000 - 2007 [ 16 ] . They proposed that physical distance , nationality , and linguistic boundaries were still barriers to scholarly collaborations ; however , the negative impact was expected to decrease over time [ 16 ] . Lynch , Heinze , and Scott described a project done by a group of collaborators from Australia , England , and South Africa [ 28 ] . The initiation of the project was from a face - to - face conversation ; and the following research tasks , which were geographically dispersed , were supported by ICTs [ 28 ] . Another example is from Kraut and his colleagues . They interviewed scholars involved in scientific collaborations . The result indicated that traditional physical proxy provided cheap and effective communication opportunities for scholars [ 24 ] . Meanwhile , they proposed that when ICTs were designed to meet the characteristics of physical proxies , they could be used to serve dispersed collaborations as effectively as physical proxies [ 24 ] . Overall , geographically co - located scholars have advantages on identifying and collaborating with each other . However , with the development of ICTs , dispersed scholars can be connected as well . In other words , space obstacles can be conquered ( or partially conquered ) by the development of ICTs . 2 . 2 . The effect of geographical positions and ICTs The discussion in Section 2 . 1 shows that co - location and communication technologies , such as ICTs , are all important to scholarly collaborations . On one hand , face - to - face communication is important since physical presence has the magic to build trusting relationships and settle negotiations and conflicts [ 1 , 27 ] . More importantly , it is easy for co - located individuals talk to each other face - to - face [ 4 , 23 ] . In the case described by Lynch et al . , face - to - face communication is the bridge to connect scholars with similar interests [ 28 ] . On the other hand , ICTs can make present - day scholarly collaborations less constrained by the distance than before . For instance , ICTs can facilitate remote communication , help with remote writing , and encourage discussions [ 30 , 42 , 45 ] . However , research also shows that ICTs cannot completely resolve the problem caused by distance . For instance , the building of trust and the coordination of activities are less supported by ICTs [ 7 , 34 ] . In summary , both geographical positions and ICTs affect scholarly collaboration . Moreover , currently , the two effects cannot completely replace each other , since each of them has its own pros and cons . This is the foundation of the research questions that will be discussed in Section 2 . 3 . 2 . 3 . The research questions The discussion in Section 2 . 1 and Section 2 . 2 shows that both the distance and the ICTs influence scholarly collaboration . More importantly , ICTs cannot completely replace the convenience brought by co - location or short distance among collaborators . Therefore , given the constantly improved technologies , especially ICTs , the research of this paper focuses on the following questions : (cid:2) What is the impact of geographic distance on scholarly collaboration ; is it negative or positive ? (cid:2) If the impact is negative , has it been lessened along the development of ICTs over time ? If not , what is the trend ? In order to answer these questions , the author runs an ERGM simulation and gets the estimated coefficients of the distances . The first research question will be answered by examining the sign of these coefficients . The second question is answered by observing the curve of the coefficient and conducting a KRUSKAL - WALLIS test on the coefficients grouped by the ICTs time intervals . If there are statistically significant differences among these intervals and the curve shows the trend , then we can strongly conclude that the trend and the coincidence exist . 3 . Data and method In Section 3 . 1 , the author introduces social network analysis ( SNA ) and ERGMs . In Section 3 . 2 , the author 723 describes the creation of the data set . Finally , the author describes the parameters used in this paper . 3 . 1 . Method The advantage of the SNA approach lies in its ability to understand social activities by focusing on the relationships among social actors [ 50 ] . In SNA , each actor is a node of the network , and the edge between a pair of node indicates the relationship between the actors . This paper uses SNA to study co - author networks so that the interactions among co - authors can be analyzed . Exponential Random Graph Models ( ERGMs ) are “a family of statistical models for social networks that permit inference about prominent patterns in the data , given the presence of other network structures [ 33 ] ” . In other words , ERGM is the model for analyzing social networks . Robins introduces ERGMs in his article [ 23 ] . If we let X ij denote the edge in a network ( i and j indicate every pair of nodes in the network ) ; then when X ij = 1 , there is a tie between i and j ; when X ij = 0 , there is no tie between i and j . X is the matrix of all X ij . The general form of the model is : Pr ( X = x ) = ( 1 / κ ) exp { ∑ A η A g A ( x ) } In this model , x is the observed network ; η A is the parameter of network configuration A ; g A ( x ) is the “ network statistic [ 3 3 ] ” for configuration A ; κ is used to normalize the probability distribution . 3 . 2 . Data The goal of the data collection is to create the geographic distance matrix as well as the co - author network . The data used here is the co - author network derived from the journal Scientometrics ( now published by Springer Netherlands ) . It embraces statistical studies on " the development and mechanism of science [ 40 ] ” . The bibliographic data is collected from the years 1983 to 2013 . The year 1983 is chosen because the Internet was built for academic use in mid - 1980s [ 26 ] . Considering the effect cannot be detected immediately after the technology is launched , the year 1983 is used as the start point to catch the period when the Internet - enabled ICTs were not popular . Moreover , the size of the data set before the year 1983 is too small to support the simulation . The data set contains 2 , 900 articles , among which 1 , 807 articles are co - authored . The co - authored articles are organized by year . Table 1 is the summary of the number of co - authored articles for each year . Table 1 . Number of co - authored articles Year 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 Article 10 7 23 19 21 22 30 24 Year 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Article 41 40 35 16 36 45 40 45 Year 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Article 58 39 51 46 41 37 47 67 Year 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Article 95 85 137 164 151 181 154 The data set is divided by year . In each year the data contains the : Article ID , Article Title , Author Name , Author ID , and Author Affiliations with addresses . A matrix of the co - author network is established for each year . Specifically , the authors of those articles are the nodes in the network . The edges among the nodes indicate the co - author relationship . Next , the matrices are converted into undirected networks by the R statnet package . Figure 1 is an example of the network . Figure 1 . The co - author network ( year 1999 ) Finally , the latitude and the longitude of those affiliations are retrieved in Google Earth by cities . The result is used to calculate the distance between each pair of the authors . The geographic distance matrix is established and calculated by the R fossil package . It is worth noticing that when an author has multiple affiliations , she will be counted as multiple authors . This is for the sake of data analysis . Moreover , a person who represents multiple affiliations is affected by shared knowledge and tasks among various organizations , especially when these organizations appear together as the person ' s affiliations in one article . There could be situations in which the author does not work with her multiple affiliations when conducting the research ; however , the task of this paper is to compare the effect of geographical distance on scholarly collaborations over time . From a data treatment perspective , this might equally amplify both the co - locating and the remote effects . Therefore , for the comparison purpose , as long as the data of different 724 years is processed under the same standard , this will not affect the comparison result . 3 . 3 The model The data set is analyzed using ERGMs . The model is estimated by R statnet using the Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation ( MCMCMLE ) . The selection of terms depends on the goal of the research as well as how much the term can help explaining the network structure [ 39 ] . There can be some co - lineation between a pair of terms [ 39 ] . Table 2 shows the parameters of the model . In the statnet package , parameters are also called terms . Table 2 . Parameters of the model Terms Explanation edgecov ( distmatrix ) Impact of geographic distances between a pair of authors edges Edge distribution meandeg Average degree distribution gwesp ( . 5 , T ) Geometrically decreasing weighted edgewise shared partner , 0 . 5 , Fixed gwnsp ( . 5 , T ) Geometrically decreasing weighted dyadwise shared partner minus geographically weighted edgewise shared partner , 0 . 5 , Fixed gwdegree ( . 5 , fixed ) Geometrically decreasing weighted degree , 0 . 5 , Fixed The term edgecov ( distmatrix ) is the distance between a pair of authors . The term edges and the term meandeg control the edge distribution and the average degree distribution . The next three terms all have “gw” in their names , meaning that these terms are weighted by geometrically decreasing weights [ 22 , 18 ] . Moreover , when the value of the first argument is between 0 . 1 and 1 . 5 , the result is considered as robust [ 18 ] . The value used in this paper is 0 . 5 which is in the interval and is tested by the author . The value of another argument is “T” , indicating that the model is not curved . The configuration represented by gwesp and gwnsp are showed in Table 3 . The term gwdegree is used to control the nodes with high nodal degree [ 18 ] . Nodal degree is the number of edges that are attached to a node [ 49 ] . Table 3 . Configurations represented by gwesp and gwnsp Terms Configurations Gwesp Gwnsp 4 . Results and discussion In this section , the author first discusses the general results . Second , the author discusses the four time intervals divided by the development of ICTs . Finally , the author discusses the results by the intervals . 4 . 1 . General description Table 4 shows the simulation results . The positive coefficient means the network is likely to be composed of the configuration represented by the term ( e . g . , edges , gwesp ) ; whereas the negative coefficient indicates the lack of that configuration .

The simulation of year 1994 cannot be converged , so there is no result for this year . The positive coefficient of gwdegree indicates that there is less preferential attachment in the network . In other words , authors with many collaborators are not especially attractive to other ones in the network . The positive coefficient of gwesp means that the network is highly clustered . The negative coefficient of gwnsp indicates that core persons or core groups are rare in the network . In other words , there are few authors or groups of authors who relate to most of the collaborations in the network . There are two possible reasons for the concurrence of the positive gwesp and the negative gwnsp . First , this phenomenon is caused by the nature of the data . When several names appear in the same paper , the authors are considered being connected to all other co - authors . Therefore , a paper with many authors will create a highly connected cluster . The other reason is that there are only a few authors who can get published more than once in one year in the same journal . Now we can describe the general features of these networks . First , the networks are sparse and locally clustered ( except year 1988 ) . Second , all the networks , except the network of year 2013 , show the feature that authors with many collaborators tend to be connected with each other to form highly connected clusters . The papers that are written by many co - authors cause this cluster phenomenon . Third , when the network is both sparse and clustered , it indicates that the subgroups within the network are not connected very well with each other . 4 . 2 . The time intervals In order to compare the distance impact by the development of ICTs , the author creates four time intervals according to the timeline of ICTs ( see Table 5 ) . Table 5 . Time intervals Intervals Time Events / Technologies / Services Pre Web 1 . 0 1980 - 1990 - Online catalog offered - Email was used in academia - The internet did not fully come into public domain Web 1 . 0 1991 - 1999 - WWW was released - Online database system offered - Web - based email systems used - Increased Internet user Web 2 . 0 2000 - 2009 - Collaboration and collective intelligence used - The number of blogs and wikis users increased - Facebook and Twitter were created Post Web 2 . 0 2010 - - There is a possibility for post Web 2 . 0 interval Reference materials : [ 2 , 8 , 10 , 13 , 17 , 20 , 25 , 26 , 29 , 31 , 41 , 52 ] The intervals are developed according to the development of ICTs which have impact on scholarly collaboration . Specifically , these ICTs are the Internet ; the World Wide Web ( WWW ) ; E - mail ; digital library and open access movement and the relating technologies ; and some Web 2 . 0 technologies such as wikis , blogs , and social networking sites . First , the Internet and the WWW act as the backbone of remote scholarly collaboration [ 5 , 19 ] . The Internet came into the academia world , expanding beyond the computer science area , in the 1980s [ 26 ] . The WWW came into being in 1990s [ 26 ] . Although scholars used both technologies , their impacts on scholarly collaborations did not become clear until late 1990s [ 20 ] . Second , E - mail is another technology that used in scholarly collaboration . E - mail bridges distant scholars by providing them with the ability to transmit ideas and files remotely . Moreover , E - mail 726 can act as coordinate tools as well as co - writing tools [ 38 ] . Using E - mail can also benefit communications across difference cultures which are the byproduct of some remote collaboration [ 37 ] . E - mail was started in the 1960s and was widely used in academia in the mid - 1980s [ 44 ] . The first commercial web - based email was launched in 1996 ; by the year 2003 , 77 million people were using computers at work and claimed that they used E - mail very often . By the year 2012 , 90 million Americans were accessing E - mail by mobile devices [ 10 ] . The third group of ICTs is the digital library and the technologies that support open access movement . These types of technologies are important to scholarly collaboration because they support the interpersonal recognition activities , which are important for scholarly communication [ 3 , 4 ] . The development of the digital library and the open access system experienced the following processes : sharing cataloging system ( 1970s ) , online cataloging available on local area networks ( mid - 1980s ) , online cataloging available in small colleges and universities ( mid - 1990s ) , and online public access systems as information hubs of organizations ( mid - 1990s ) [ 2 ] . When compared with digital libraries , the open access movement and the relating technologies came into being much later . Starting from early 1990s , the open access movement can be divided into : the pioneering years ( 1993 - 1999 ) , the innovation years ( 2000 - 2004 ) , and the consolidation years ( 2005 - 2009 ) [ 25 ] . Finally , Web 2 . 0 is composed of technologies and services enabling and making use of collective intelligence [ 31 ] . The influence of Web 2 . 0 on scholarly collaborations is reflected by the definition per se , including knowledge seeking ( search engines ) , real time communication ( real - time communication tools ) , collective writing and discussion ( e . g . , wikis , blogs , and forums ) , creating and maintaining connections ( social networking sites ) , and so on [ 6 , 32 , 48 , 51 ] . The development of Web 2 . 0 technologies and services is generalized in table 5 . 4 . 3 . The impact of geographic distances overtime In section 2 . 3 , there are two research questions . In Table 4 , we can see that , except for year 1988 , the coefficients of edgecov are all negative . This indicates a negative impact of geographic distance on scholarly collaborations . This answers the first question : the distance negatively affects scholarly collaboration . Although the coefficients are small , given the long distance , the coefficients still make sense . For instance , in year 2013 there is a collaboration between an author from Shanghai , China and two authors from Honolulu , U . S . The second question is about the trend of such an impact , which is shown in Figure 2 . In this graph the trend line is upward . Given the negative coefficient , we can say that the negative impact of geographic distance tends to decrease over time . Figure 2 . Edgecov by year Significant level : ▲ 1 , × 0 . 01 , (cid:441) 0 . 001 It is worthwhile to notice that the coefficients exhibit strong fluctuations , which is seen in the year 1983 when the effect is very negative , compared to the year 1988 when the effect becomes positive ( see Figure 2 ) . Now let us find out the reason for this fluctuation . The expectation is that the impact of geographic distance is negative , which is opposite to the data of year 1988 . However , when looking at the raw data , we can find that in 1988 most of the collaborations were done among authors at the same location . Table 6 shows the number of authors and distribution of their affiliations . Among 22 papers , there are seven papers that involve international collaborations ( see Table 6 ) . This means the positive coefficient is from collaborations that involve international authors who are extremely far away from their colleagues . Table 6 . Papers and the distribution of authors by country , year 1988 Paper Authors Paper Authors 1 3Croatia 12 2 - Canada 1UK 2 2France 2UK 13 3Australia 1US 3 2India 14 2US 1China 4 2India 15 2Netherlands 5 3India 16 4UK 2US 6 2UK 17 3Switzerland 1Germany 7 2UK 18 2Mexico 2Hungary 8 2Belgium 19 3Hungary 9 2Belgium 20 2Hungary 10 7Japan 21 3Hungary 11 2India 22 2Hungary The reason for the positive impact on long distance should be considered together with another phenomenon . We should notice that in the period of 727 1983 to 1990 , only the year 1988 contained many long distance collaborations . Table 7 shows the data in the time interval 1983 to 1990 . Long distance collaboration is defined as intercontinental collaboration . Table 7 . Number of long distance collaborations involved in those papers ( 1983 - 1990 ) Year Papers International collaboration Long distance international collaboration 1983 10 0 0 1984 7 2 0 1985 23 0 0 1986 19 1 0 1987 21 0 0 1988 22 7 5 1989 30 1 1 1990 24 2 1 Now the fluctuation of impact is explained . Combining the lack of international collaboration and the positive impact of year 1988 , the analysis tells us that in the period of pre - Web 1 . 0 , despite remote collaborations not being as common as they are today , collaborations at a distance are still possible . Now let us discuss the interval of 1991 to 1999 . Figure 2 shows a quick clime up from year 1991 to year 1993 . After this increase , the line slightly decreases ; however , the overall linear trend is ascending . The trend line of the Web 2 . 0 period and the Post Web 2 . 0 period ( 2000 to 2009 to 2013 ) shakes and rises over time with the overall trend ascending . Overall , the impact of geographic distance is mostly negative . Moreover , the trend line of the impact keeps decreasing in a zigzag manner . So far , the author has discussed the general trend of the impact of the distance . In the next part , the author will test whether the change of coefficient coincides with the time interval . The idea is to conducts a KRUSKAL - WALLIS test to examine whether the coefficients in different intervals are statistically different from each other . Table 8 and Table 9 summarize the coefficient of edgecov by time intervals . Table 8 . Coefficients of geographical distance by time intervals 1983 - 1990 1991 - 1999 2000 - 2009 2010 - 2013 - 1 . 69E - 02 - 2 . 03E - 03 - 1 . 18E - 03 - 6 . 72E - 04 - 1 . 22E - 02 - 6 . 85E - 04 - 6 . 05E - 04 - 2 . 87E - 04 - 1 . 11E - 03 - 2 . 16E - 04 - 6 . 80E - 04 - 2 . 84E - 04 - 3 . 26E - 03 NA - 4 . 19E - 04 - 2 . 47E - 04 - 1 . 85E - 03 - 2 . 35E - 04 - 9 . 15E - 04 9 . 25E - 04 - 7 . 481E - 04 - 2 . 08E - 04 - 8 . 87E - 04 - 8 . 205E - 04 - 2 . 21E - 04 - 2 . 82E - 03 - 9 . 679E - 04 - 6 . 49E - 04 - 9 . 002E - 04 - 1 . 92E - 04 - 2 . 73E - 04 Intuitively , coefficients of the latter intervals , as a whole , are larger than those of the former ones . When looking at Table 9 , the arithmetic means of these coefficients increase sequentially . Table 9 . The arithmetic mean of the coefficients 1983 - 1990 1991 - 1999 2000 - 2009 2010 - 2013 - 4 . 76E - 03 - 8 . 25E - 04 - 5 . 34E - 04 - 3 . 73E - 04 Figure 3 is the result of the KRUSKAL - WALLIS test . There is a statistically significant difference among the coefficients of the four intervals ( p - value < 0 . 05 ) . ( For the sake of the print quality , Figure 3 and Figure 4 are the copies , not the screenshots , of the results of the tests . ) Figure 3 . Kruskal - Wallis results It is worthwhile to notice that when conducting the ANOVA test , these coefficients do not pass the homogeneity of variance test . This is why the author choose KRUSKAL - WALLIS test instead . This result also indicates that the coefficients of different time intervals display different statistical characters . Figure 4 shows the result of the homogeneity of variance test ( p - value < 0 . 05 ) . Figure 4 . Homogeneity of variance test Now , let us discuss the homogeneity of variance test . Take the 1983 to 1990 interval from Table 7 as an example . We can see that long distance collaborations are not normal or frequent activities at that time . In other words , although ICTs are not as rich and diverse as they are today , the authors are still able to connect with scholars at a distance and even overseas . 728 Specifically , in the pre - Web 1 . 0 interval , people already have enough tools to make connections . The improvement in ICTs contributes to the ease and the quality of connections and might increase the number of scholars who can conduct a long distance collaboration ; however , it does not significantly affect those who can always get access to advanced communication technologies and the remote research that requires minimum remote communication . The other possibility is that the collaborators with different affiliations stay physically together in order to conduct the research ; thereby , the remote collaboration is actually not remote . The improvement of ICTs has little impact on these authors . The intense fluctuation of the coefficient of the time interval 1983 to 1990 and the relative mild wave of other intervals indicate that in the early times of ICTs people could remotely collaborate . However , this type of collaboration is not as normal as it is today . With the development of ICTs , the ease and quality of long distance collaboration increases . This partially explains the relatively mild fluctuations of the coefficient in the latter time intervals . 5 . Conclusion and future work In this paper the author examines whether the impact of geographic distance on scholarly collaborations is decreasing over time or not . The author also tries to investigate the relationship between the changing impact and the development of ICTs . The findings are as follows : The negative coefficient of edgecov indicates that geographic distance is an issue for scholarly collaboration for all of the time examined . Moreover , the fluctuation of coefficients in the early time interval is larger than the latter ones . This is possibly due to the development of ICTs , which increase the ease and quality of long distance scholarly collaboration . Last but not the least , there are differences among the coefficients of different time intervals . Moreover , the coefficients within the same time interval are not statistically homogeneous . This is due to the fact that some remote research does not require a high quality of remote communication . Another reason is that the collaborators with different affiliations can stay physically together to conduct the research . The third reason is that there are always scholars who can get access to advanced communication tools when those tools are not commonly used . In these cases the improvement of the ICTs does not impact the collaboration very much . This research is preliminary . Thus , there are several undertakings that need to be done . The first task is to examine other journals and compare the results . Second , there are other factors that need to be investigated . For instance , an author ’s affiliation and knowledge background can also affect scholarly collaboration . Finally , interviews with authors who have collaboration experiences will be helpful to give an in - depth understanding to the results . 6 . References [ 1 ] P . A . Arling , E . J . Miech , G . W .
