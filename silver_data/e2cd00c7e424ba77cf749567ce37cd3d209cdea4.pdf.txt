The objective of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of our pediatric population during four waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic from a private hospital . Methods : A retrospective observational study in patients under 15 years old with con ﬁ rmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection by real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) test from April 1 , 2020 to April 30 , 2022 . Demographic , clinical , and therapy variables were examined , and the Chi - square test was used for comparisons . Results : From 5 , 870 RT - PCR taken through the ﬁ rst two years of the pandemic , 1 , 371 tested positive , obtaining a positivity rate of 23 . 37 % . Patients ’ median ( IQR ) age was 9 . 0 ( 7 . 0 ) years , and most were male ( n = 705 , 51 . 4 % ) . The primary comorbidities were rhinitis ( n = 239 , 17 . 4 % ) and asthma ( n = 172 , 12 . 5 % ) . Most cases were scholars ( n = 568 , 41 . 4 % ) during the fourth COVID - 19 wave ( n = 831 , 60 . 6 % ) . Almost all cases ( 88 . 2 % ) reported prior exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 - infected households . Six percent ( n = 82 ) of the patients reported being vaccinated against SARS - CoV - 2 . Most participants ( 89 . 3 % ) received outpatient care , and 0 . 6 % required hospitalization . Nine ( 0 . 6 % ) patients were diagnosed with Multisystemic In ﬂ ammatory Syndrome in Children ( MIS - C ) . The second COVID - 19 wave reported a higher frequency of anosmia and dysgeusia ; the third wave reported fever and malaise , and the fourth wave reported cough , odynophagia , and vomiting ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The second wave reported no treatment ( n = 23 , 15 . 3 % ) , while the third and fourth waves reported outpatient care and hospitalization ( n = 367 , 95 . 1 % ; and n = 4 , 1 . 0 % , respectively ) ( p = < 0 . 001 ) . Reinfection cases were frequent during the second wave ( n = 8 , 5 . 3 % ) ( p = < 0 . 001 ) . Rhinorrhea , vomiting , and diarrhea were reported mainly by infants ; fever by preschoolers ; abdominal pain by scholars ; and headache , odynophagia , Abbreviations HCN , Hospital Clinica Nova ; RT - PCR , real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ; OMS , World Health Organization ; IQR , interquartile range ; MIS - C , multisystemic in ﬂ ammatory syndrome in children ; BNT162b2 , P ﬁ zer - BioNTech ; ICU , intensive care unit .

Neither treatment nor reinfection showed age - related differences ( p = 0 . 496 and p = 0 . 224 , respectively ) . Conclusion : The study demonstrated a lower positive rate for SARS - CoV - 2 in our hospital ’ The majority of cases in our study were outpatients who reported a mild infection with a favorable evolution based on symptomatic treatment . KEYWORDS children , pediatrics , SARS - CoV - 2 , epidemiology , COVID - 19 1 . Introduction Two years have passed since the World Health Organization ( OMS ) was forced to recognize the novel coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) as a pandemic ( 1 ) . In the beginning , the most affected population was adults . A systematic review of the literature on COVID - 19 patients from China , Italy , Spain , and the United States , reported that pediatric cases were a minority ( < 2 % ) ( 2 ) . Until April 30th , 2022 , Mexico reported 5 , 761 , 682 con ﬁ rmed cases , of which 281 , 365 ( 4 . 8 % ) were under 16 years of age ( 3 , 4 ) . To minimize exposure to the virus , the Mexican government enforced a lockdown , shutting down businesses , schools , and non - essential services so that people would stay home ( 5 ) . People were encouraged to follow basic hygiene measures , social distancing , and work from home ( 6 , 7 ) . The government used a four - tired traf ﬁ c light monitoring system , based on the epidemiological risks of contagion for SARS - CoV - 2 , to inform citizens about the use of public spaces ( 8 ) . As the pandemic continued , pediatric COVID - 19 reported asymptomatic or mild symptoms , with a lower risk of hospitalization and complications ( 9 , 10 ) . Two main factors could make the SARS - CoV - 2 diagnosis relatively challenging for this group . The ﬁ rst factor is the non - speci ﬁ c clinical features , which may lead to misleading the cause with other viral pathogens . The second factor is the increase in suspected cases with no diagnostic tests available . The state of Nuevo Leon , México , reported 319 , 488 pediatric con ﬁ rmed cases until April 30th , 2022 ( 4 ) . Hospital Clinica Nova ( HCN ) , a private hospital in this state , had 44 , 186 bene ﬁ ciaries , of which 10 , 673 were under 16 years of age . This hospital only provides attention to a company ’ s employees and their families ; hence the pediatric population had a close follow - up . To avoid COVID - 19 - positive cases , this company implemented a safety protocol among its workers , used diverse strategies to spread information about the pandemic , and established COVID - 19 attention units at HCN . Nevertheless , the impact of these measures was unknown . This study aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of our pediatric population during four waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic . As a second objective , we described the contingency measures that took place in HCN to reduce the virus transmission . 2 . Material and methods 2 . 1 . Design This retrospective observational study included patients under 16 years of age with con ﬁ rmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection by real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) test at HCN from April 1st , 2020 to April 30th , 2022 . The study received approval from the local Institutional Review Board ( Ref . : 10092021 - CN - 1a - CI ) . It followed the STROBE guidelines and the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association ( Declaration of Helsinki ) for experiments involving humans ( 11 ) . The use of a consent form did not apply due to the retrospective nature of this study . 2 . 2 . COVID - protocol attention in the hospital The HCN implemented diverse strategies to guide patients through the health crisis ; this could be divided into two main approaches : social media / technology use and exclusive attention units at the hospital . The ﬁ rst approach used telemedicine instead of face - to - face appointments , webinars , and social networks to communicate updates on the COVID - 19 outbreak . Besides , HCN established a service center called “ COVID - Line ” for counseling on suspected cases and follow - ups , so patients did not need to go to the hospital for medical advice . The second approach consisted of an exclusive area for respiratory / febrile cases to evaluate the severity of the clinical manifestations , whether a COVID - 19 test was necessary , and decide the general management . Indications for testing included at least one of the following : fever , respiratory / gastrointestinal symptoms , asthenia , anosmia , hypogeusia , or a positive close contact . Also , RT - PCR was mandatory in patients who had surgery . All non - severe cases received outpatient care , which consisted of symptomatic management with acetaminophen , Non - Steroidal Anti - In ﬂ ammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) , antihistamines , and probiotics if needed . 2 . 3 . Data collection The department of epidemiology collected data on patients who attended to discard a SARS - CoV - 2 infection . This database Ramírez - Cázares et al . 10 . 3389 / fped . 2023 . 1150738 Frontiers in Pediatrics 02 frontiersin . org helped us to search for patients according to the study ’ s inclusion criteria . We used the Mexican National database to calculate the national and statewide positivity rate of the RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 compare them with the HCN positivity rate ( 4 ) . The inclusion criteria were individuals of both genders under 16 years of age who were HCN bene ﬁ ciaries with con ﬁ rmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection by RT - PCR from April 2020 to April 2022 . The exclusion criteria were a negative RT - PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 or another diagnostic test for SARS - CoV - 2 . The variables we analyzed were : age , gender , comorbidities ( e . g . , obesity , overweight , asthma , rhinitis ) , infected household members con ﬁ rmed by RT - PCR test , date when the RT - PCR test was taken , immunization schedule , clinical manifestation during the SARS - CoV - 2 infection , treatment ( e . g . , no treatment at all , outpatient care or hospitalization ) , complications and reinfection . We strati ﬁ ed the sample into two primary analyses : COVID - 19 waves and age groups . COVID - 19 waves were considered as follows : the ﬁ rst wave from April 1st to August 31st , 2020 ; the second from September 1st , 2020 to April 30th , 2021 ; the third from May 1st to November 30th , 2021 ; and the fourth from December 1st , 2021 to April 30th , 2022 . The age groups were considered as follows : infants ( 0 – 1 years ) , preschoolers ( 2 – 5 years ) , scholars ( 6 – 11 years ) , and adolescents ( 12 – 15 years ) . 2 . 4 . Statistical analysis The researchers reviewed the quality control and anonymization of the database . We used descriptive statistics for the categorical data , such as frequencies and percentages . We used median and interquartile range ( IQR ) for quantitative variables since they showed no normal distribution . The Chi - square test was used to compare characteristics between groups . The data were processed on the statistical program SPSS , version 25 . The analysis was two - tailed , and a p - value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . 3 . Results From April 1st , 2020 to April 30th , 2022 , 5 , 870 pediatric patients underwent RT - PCR testing , and 1 , 371 tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . The age group with more SARS - CoV - 2 cases was the scholars ( n = 568 , 41 . 4 % ) , and the COVID - 19 wave with more infections was the fourth wave ( n = 831 , 60 . 6 % ) . 3 . 1 . General results The patients ’ median ( IQR ) age was 9 . 0 ( 7 . 0 ) years , and most participants were male ( n = 705 , 51 . 4 % ) . The comorbidities reported were : rhinitis ( n = 239 , 17 . 4 % ) , asthma ( n = 172 , 12 . 5 % ) , and obesity ( n = 82 , 6 . 0 % ) . Twelve hundred nine ( 88 . 2 % ) patients reported a household infection ; the rest ( n = 162 , 11 . 8 % ) was considered a symptomatic index case in their household . Ten - point one percent ( n = 138 ) of the participants reported an asymptomatic infection . Fever was reported in 52 . 9 % ( n = 725 ) of the patients . Cough , rhinorrhea , and odynophagia were classi ﬁ ed as respiratory symptoms ; nausea , abdominal pain , vomiting , and diarrhea as gastrointestinal symptoms . Most patients reported respiratory symptoms ( n = 1 , 041 , 75 . 9 % ) , where cough was the most frequent ( n = 707 , 51 . 6 % ) . Only 223 ( 16 . 3 % ) patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms . Of all the reported pediatric cases in HCN , 10 . 1 % ( n = 139 ) received no treatment . Around 1 , 224 ( 89 . 3 % ) received symptomatic measures as outpatients ; three received unproven therapies ( e . g . , ivermectin ) from an external source . Only eight ( 0 . 6 % ) patients required hospital admission . Of those eight patients : three presented pneumonias , and only one developed severe manifestation , demanding high - ﬂ ow ventilation management and Remdesivir ; two presented another non - COVID - related diagnosis , but an RT - PCR was performed as part of the admittance protocol ; one patient was already being treated for chronic renal failure when tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ; the last two patients were diagnosed on the preoperative testing for appendicitis surgery . Twenty - one ( 1 . 5 % ) patients reported SARS - CoV - 2 reinfection . The median ( IQR ) days between the two RT - PCR tests was 207 ( 202 ) . Nine ( 0 . 6 % ) patients were diagnosed with Multisystemic In ﬂ ammatory Syndrome in Children ( MIS - C ) , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria ( 12 ) . All patients received an immunoglobulin infusion as the initial therapy ; only four required dexamethasone as second - line treatment . To date , all patients have reported favorable evolution . Six percent ( n = 182 ) of the patients reported prior immunization against SARS - CoV - 2 , but only 3 . 2 % ( n = 44 ) completed the vaccination schedule . A total of 1 , 098 ( 80 . 1 % ) patients denied being vaccinated against SARS - CoV - 2 , and 191 ( 13 . 9 % ) patients ’ immunization status was unknown . All patients reported receiving the P ﬁ zer - BioNTech ( BNT162b2 ) vaccine . 3 . 2 . COVID - 19 waves The Mexican National database registered 289 , 875 RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 in the pediatric population , from which 74 , 678 tested positive , obtaining a positivity rate of 25 . 76 % . The state of Nuevo León reported 3 , 792 positive tests out of 16 , 095 RT - PCR , obtaining a positivity rate of 23 . 56 % . At HCN , 1 , 371 of 5 , 867 RT - PCR tested positive , obtaining a positivity rate of 23 . 37 % . Figure 1 shows the national , statal , and HCN positivity rates according to the four COVID - 19 waves . The ﬁ rst wave reported only four ( 0 . 3 % ) infected patients ; due to the shortage of patients , it was excluded from further data analysis . During the second , third , and fourth waves , 150 ( 10 . 9 % ) , 386 ( 28 . 2 % ) , and 831 ( 60 . 6 % ) patients were infected , respectively . The second wave reported adolescents as the most affected group ( n = 77 , 51 . 3 % ) , and the third and fourth reported scholars ( n = 154 , and n = 363 , respectively ; 39 . 9 % and 43 . 7 % , respectively ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) . There was no signi ﬁ cant difference between genders ( p = 0 . 137 ) . During the fourth wave , most patients reported having one or more comorbidities ( n = 297 , 35 . 7 % ) ( p = 0 . 039 ) . The most frequent Ramírez - Cázares et al . 10 . 3389 / fped . 2023 . 1150738 Frontiers in Pediatrics 03 frontiersin . org conditions were rhinitis [ n = 178 , 21 . 4 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) ] and asthma [ n = 119 , 14 . 3 % , ( p = 0 . 032 ) ] . An infected household was most common during the fourth wave [ n = 750 , 90 . 3 % , ( p = 0 . 025 ) ] . Vaccination status was signi ﬁ cantly different among the waves : unvaccinated ( n = 590 , 71 . 0 % ) , vaccinated ( n = 76 , 9 . 1 % ) , and unknown status ( n = 165 , 19 . 9 % ) were frequently reported during the fourth wave ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics and medical history according to COVID - 19 waves . FIGURE 1 National , statal , and HCN positivity rates of RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 according to the four COVID - 19 waves . Graph correlating the positivity rates on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 . HCN reported the lowest positivity rates during the ﬁ rst two years of the pandemic , except during the second wave . The peak during the second wave was attributed to HCN testing children exclusively after reporting persistent symptoms .

Neither treatment nor reinfection cases were signi ﬁ cantly different among the age groups . Table 4 shows the clinical manifestations according to age groups . 4 . Discussion Our primary objective was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID - 19 pediatric patients at HCN , and secondly , to describe the contingency measures that took place in HCN during the four waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic . It ’ s important to remark that HCN only provides attention to a company ’ s employees and their families ; hence the pediatric population had a close outpatient follow - up . The majority of positive cases emerged during the fourth COVID - 19 wave , where infants were more frequently infected . Most patients showed an asymptomatic or mild infection with a favorable evolution based on symptomatic treatment . We compared the national , statal , and institutional positivity rates on RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 . HCN reported the lowest positivity rates during the ﬁ rst two years of the pandemic , except during the second wave ( 4 ) . The inconsistency could be attributed to the belief that children were less frequently infected than adults , leading HCN to test them exclusively after reporting persistent symptoms ( 13 ) . On the other hand , our implemented strategy based on educational strategies and closer patient follow - up might explain the lower rates in the next waves . At the beginning of the pandemic , household contacts were assumed to be the primary source of contagion ( 14 – 17 ) . Nevertheless , children have been considered partially responsible for the spread of infectious diseases on account of frequently being asymptomatic carriers ( 18 ) . During the ﬁ rst two years of the pandemic , 11 . 8 % of our sample was the index symptomatic case in the household . On the contrary , a prospective study by Soriano - Arandres et al . and a systematic review and meta - analysis by Chen et al . mention pediatric index case rates as 7 . 7 % and 10 . 3 % , respectively . Our higher incidence may be related to the fact that we tested every child despite having low - grade symptoms or a non - COVID - 19 - related primary diagnosis , unlike at the beginning of the pandemic when children were hardly tested ( 18 , 19 ) . Pediatric COVID - 19 cases increased over time . In our sample , infected patients during the fourth wave two - folded those in the third wave ( 60 . 6 % , and 28 . 2 % , respectively ) . The Delta SARS - CoV - 2 variant triggered the third wave in Mexico . Meanwhile , the Omicron variant emerged by the end of 2021 to cause the fourth wave , reporting the highest number of infected patients in our country . A crucial Omicron characteristic that justi ﬁ es this phenomenon is its transmissibility , which is 3 , 31 - fold higher than the Delta variant ( 20 ) . Other reasons for the accelerated increase in pediatric COVID - 19 cases during the fourth wave were the relaxation of protective measures , social distancing , and increased social and school activities ( 21 ) .

During most of the ﬁ rst and second waves , the four - tired traf ﬁ c light denoted the highest level of risk ; it encouraged high - risk populations to visit public spaces under exceptional circumstances . Non - essential locations remained closed or reduced attendance capacity . During the third wave , the vaccination campaign against SARS - COV - 2 began ; it was divided by age category , beginning with the older population . During the third wave , face - to - face class limitations shifted . In May 2021 , middle - higher and higher educational levels could voluntarily return to school ; preschool , primary , and secondary levels returned by the end of August 2021 . This wave allowed individuals to visit more places as long as they followed the hygiene measures established by the government . However , crowded events were still restricted . The fourth wave reported either an intermediate or low risk of contagion for SARS - CoV - 2 in public spaces , and there were no establishments with capacity restrictions . Face mask use in open spaces was optional but obligatory in closed spaces ( 22 ) . On the other hand , the transition back to school was challenging . The government allowed higher levels of education to go back to in - person classes before reopening the lower levels . All educational centers had to adhere to the following measures : limit the number of students per classroom , maintain an appropriate distance between students and teachers , ensure that every room has adequate ventilation , give students the option to study at home or go to school , and to have a constant supervision of suspicious symptoms . Masks were mandatory in all schools at all times . The permitted student capacity in classrooms progressively increased over time . By the beginning of 2022 , all educational levels will have returned to the school at full classroom capacity . Sanitary measures were required to be observed ( 22 ) . The population in this study demonstrated con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 cases being slightly higher in males ( 51 . 4 % ) , similar to other studies such as Martínez - García et al . ( 59 . 3 % ) , Olivar - López et al . ( 53 % ) , Nachega et al . ( 52 . 4 % ) , Aragón - Nogales et al . ( 55 . 2 % ) , Niño - Serna et al . ( 54 % ) ( 23 – 27 ) . Contrary to what was described in the literature , we found scholars as the most infected group . A few studies proved that children older than twelve years had a higher frequency of testing positive for COVID - 19 ( 13 , 15 , 27 ) . Martínez - García et al . reported infants under ﬁ ve years with a more extensive distribution among all infected groups ( 23 ) . Meanwhile , Olivar - López et al . described a prevalence in both infants and adolescents as the positive pediatric groups ( 24 ) .

The clinical spectrum of COVID - 19 in children is broad . A systematic review and meta - analysis by Qi et al . that included 2 , 874 patients from 37 articles reported numerous asymptomatic COVID - 19 cases , accounting for 27 . 7 % of the sample ( 28 ) . In another meta - analysis by Behnood et al . , the broad rate range of asymptomatic patients was very wide , between 12 % and 64 % ( 29 ) . Our study reported 10 . 1 % asymptomatic cases . The variety in the asymptomatic rate might be because its detection is separate from the usual standard , and the protocol for diagnosis may differ among institutions . However , as children present an asymptomatic infection or have less severe symptoms , they are less frequently tested , consequently underestimating the number of infected patients ( 30 ) . The most common symptoms in order or frequency were fever , cough , and rhinorrhea , just as has been described in other worldwide pediatric cases ( 2 , 14 , 17 , 23 ) . However , abdominal pain , diarrhea , and vomiting were also found in our study . Gastrointestinal manifestations are commonly reported in young children ; in our study , toddlers reported a higher incidence than other age groups ( 31 ) . A systematic review and meta - analysis of Clinical features of pediatric COVID - 19 , which included 37 articles and a total of 2 , 874 patients by Qi et al . , described the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms between 3 . 6 % – 7 . 2 % . They also suggested that despite ﬁ nding a low prevalence , gastrointestinal manifestation should receive considerable attention when diagnosing pediatric COVID - 19 , to which we also agreed ( 28 ) . Children and adolescents are less likely to develop severe COVID - 19 manifestations . Previous studies mentioned that patients with underlying medical conditions are more susceptible to severe illness with higher hospitalization and mortality rates ( 13 , 23 , 26 , 32 ) . In a cross - sectional study on 43 , 465 pediatric patients with COVID - 19 by Kompaniyets et al . , the signi ﬁ cant risk factors for hospitalization were type 1 diabetes and obesity . Meanwhile , the risk factors for severe COVID - 19 illness were type 1 diabetes and cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies ( 33 ) . A Systematic Review and Meta - Analysis by Choi et al . also found obesity and diabetes as risk factors for severe COVID - 19 ( 34 ) . O ’ Neill et al . reported kidney disease as another risk factor for hospitalization with COVID - 19 ( 32 ) . One of our eight inpatients was already hospitalized for chronic renal failure management when he tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , but his evolution was favorable . Although comorbidities are associated with hospitalization and an unfavorable prognosis , our study could not ﬁ nd such a relation . Similar to what has been reported , our patients reported non serious clinical manifestations , receiving symptomatic treatment as the only medical management . To date , severe manifestations range between 1 % – 6 % of the cases ( 13 , 15 ) . Of our eight hospitalized patients , only one received Remdesivir as a COVID - 19 treatment . Remdesivir is the only antiviral drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for use in hospitalized children with COVID - 19 ( 17 , 35 ) . The rest of our inpatients with incidental positive SARS - CoV - 2 tests reported an asymptomatic infection and a favorable evolution . One of the complications of pediatric COVID - 19 is MIS - C . A systematic Review of the characteristics associated with COVID - 19 in children by Kornitzer et al . reported 543 out of 4 , 811 ( 11 . 28 % ) with compatible symptoms of MIS - C ( 36 ) . Other studies describe that children with MIS - C often are hospitalized and require intensive care unit ( ICU ) management due to possible cardiac complications ( 35 ) . In our case , only nine ( 0 . 6 % ) patients were diagnosed with MIS - C . None required ICU management ; their treatment consisted of immunoglobulin and dexamethasone , as mentioned in the literature ( 35 ) . To date , none has shown any complications . The FDA approved the vaccination of adolescents from 12 to 15 years of age in May 2021 , and children from 5 to 11 years of age until October 2021 ( 37 , 38 ) . In Mexico , the COVID - 19 vaccine was available for adolescents from 15 to 17 years old until December 2021 ( 39 ) . Nevertheless , by the time this article was written , vaccination campaigns for COVID - 19 in Mexico were not available yet . The hospital location is near the frontier with the United States , so the parents had a more promising chance to vaccinate their children against SARS - CoV - 2 . However , children were required to attend school regardless of their vaccination status . Nearly all the literature on pediatric COVID - 19 corresponds to studies that analyze the inpatient / ICU treatments or the disease ’ s behavior in immunocompromised patients . There ’ s few reports of the outpatient clinical characteristics and their evolution along the COVID - 19 waves as presented in this study . There is too much to understand about the SARS - CoV - 2 infection among individuals with nonserious clinical presentations of COVID - 19 . This study will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of pediatric COVID - 19 and the importance of following strict hygiene measures . We faced several limitations while doing this research . First , the study ’ s retrospective nature stopped us from knowing the authentic time lapse between the onset of the symptoms and testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Second , parents usually denied or omitted information regarding immunizations received abroad , compromising the vaccination status of the children . Besides , despite not having received a vaccine , children were required to attend school . For future analysis , it could be crucial to con ﬁ rm this kind of information . This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations of the pediatric population with a positive RT - PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 along the four COVID - 19 waves in our unit . Most participants were outpatients who reported a mild infection with a favorable evolution based on symptomatic treatment . Despite the majority of our population being unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated , they showed a low rate of complications . Nevertheless , it still needs to be discovered how this will change after schools re - open , as the actual vaccine shortage for children and adolescents in Mexico .
