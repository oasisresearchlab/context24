However , the effects of viruses 32 remain largely unknown in many environments , including in drinking water systems . Drinking 33 water metagenomic studies have offered a whole community perspective of bacterial impacts on 34 water quality , but have not yet considered the influences of viruses . In this study , we address this 35 gap by mining viral DNA sequences from publicly available drinking water metagenomes from 36 distribution systems in six countries around the world . These datasets provide a snapshot of the 37 taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of the global drinking water virome ; and provide an 38 opportunity to investigate the effects of geography , climate , and drinking water treatment 39 practices on viral diversity . Both environmental conditions and differences in sample processing 40 were found to influence the viral composition . Using free chlorine as the residual disinfectant 41 was associated with clear differences in viral taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential , with 42 significantly fewer viral populations and less even viral community structures than observed in 43 distribution systems without residual disinfectant . Additionally , drinking water viruses carry 44 antibiotic resistance genes ( ARGs ) , as well as genes to survive oxidative stress and nitrogen 45 limitation . Through this study , we have demonstrated that viral communities are diverse across 46 drinking water systems and vary with the use of residual disinfectant . Our findings offer 47 directions for future research to develop a more robust understanding of how virus - bacteria 48 interactions in drinking water distribution systems affect water quality . 49 50 Keywords : viruses , virome , metagenomics , microbiome , disinfection , drinking water 51 52 3 1 . Introduction 53 In an effort to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases , previous research on viruses in drinking 54 water has focused on tracking and eliminating human viral pathogens ( Dong et al . , 2010 ; Gall et 55 al . , 2015 ; Petrovich et al . , 2020 ; Rao et al . , 1981 ; Ye et al . , 2012 ) . For example , researchers have 56 tracked specific human viruses with qPCR to understand their distribution throughout drinking 57 water treatment plants and distribution systems ( Albinana - Gimenez et al . , 2006 ; Samhan et al . , 58 2015 ; Ye et al . , 2012 ) . While research on the presence and fate of human viruses is essential for 59 assessing drinking water quality , the impacts of bacterial viruses , commonly referred to as 60 bacteriophages ( or phages ) , have rarely been addressed . Phages influence microbial populations 61 ( Rohwer et al . , 2009 ; Suttle , 2007 ) and biogeochemical cycling ( Parmar et al . , 2017 ) , through 62 mortality ( Fuhrman and Noble , 1995 ; Guidi et al . , 2016 ) and by facilitating horizontal gene 63 transfer between microorganisms and across environments ( Rohwer et al . , 2009 ) . Similarly , 64 viruses likely impact both beneficial and detrimental bacteria and other microorganisms in 65 drinking water systems that have both direct ( e . g . , causing illness ) and indirect effects ( e . g . , 66 nitrification and corrosion ) on drinking water quality . 67 68 Metagenomic studies have become critical to evaluate the cumulative effects of the drinking 69 water microbiome on water quality ( Hull et al . , 2019 ; Liu et al . , 2013 ) . Past studies have shown 70 that many factors , ranging from source waters ( Assche et al . , 2019 ; Stanish et al . , 2016 ) to 71 treatment practices ( Bautista - de los Santos et al . , 2016 ; Dai et al . , 2020 ; Pinto et al . , 2012 ) , 72 influence the bacterial , archaeal , and eukaryotic inhabitants of drinking water . For instance , the 73 use of residual disinfectants ( e . g . , free chlorine , chloramine ) has been connected to the selection 74 of opportunistic pathogens ( Feazel et al . , 2009 ; Kotlarz et al . , 2019 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ; Vaerewijck 75 4 et al . , 2005 ) , the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes ( Jia et al . , 2019 , 2015 ; Shi et al . , 76 2012 ) , and shaping microbial communities ( Dai et al . , 2020 ; Hull et al . , 2019 ; Krishna et al . , 77 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . At most , these studies have quantified the fraction of viral sequences in 78 a cellular metagenome ( Brumfield et al . , 2020 ; Gomez - Alvarez et al . , 2012 ; Stamps et al . , 2018 ) . 79 This leaves fundamental information about drinking water viruses , such as their taxonomic or 80 metabolic diversity and influence on the drinking water microbiome , unknown . To fill similar 81 knowledge gaps in other environments , cellular metagenomes have been re - examined for DNA 82 viruses , revealing novel viral diversity and offering insights into viral - host interactions ( Paez - 83 Espino et al . , 2016 ; Roux et al . , 2015b ) . Taking such an approach can provide an untapped 84 opportunity to illuminate the effects of phages on drinking water quality and safety . 85 86 The overall goal of this work was to characterize viral communities in drinking water 87 distribution systems . To do so , we identified viral sequences from publicly available 88 metagenomic datasets from drinking water distribution systems from around the world to assess 89 viral taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential . We further investigated the effect of study 90 characteristics ( e . g . , the type of filter used for sample processing and the DNA extraction 91 method ) and environmental conditions ( e . g . , water quality ) on the structuring of the observed 92 viral communities . This study lays the groundwork for understanding the impact of viruses on 93 the microbial communities in drinking water distribution systems . 94 5 2 . Methodology 95 2 . 1 Data Collection 96 Publicly available drinking water metagenomic reads were downloaded from NCBI using the 97 SRA Toolkit v2 . 9 . 6 ( Leinonen et al . , 2011 ) ( Table S1 ) . Sequences deposited on MG - RAST were 98 directly requested from researchers . Only water samples that were collected from drinking water 99 distribution systems and that were sequenced using Illumina short read technology were included 100 in our analysis , excluding samples taken from within treatment plants and distribution system 101 biofilm samples . Based on these criteria , 164 samples were used . Sequencing for some samples 102 was replicated , resulting in a total of 312 sequencing runs . Replicate sequencing sets from the 103 same samples were pooled during subsequent analyses ( “sample” Table S1 ) . Table S1 provides 104 information about sample processing , sequencing platform , and other metadata for each sample 105 included in this study . Water quality parameters for the Dai et al ( 2020 ) and Sevillano et al 106 ( 2021 ) samples are provided in Tables S2 and S3 , respectively . 107 2 . 2 Sequence Read Processing 108 Sequence reads were filtered and trimmed using fastp v0 . 20 . 1 ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) . All code is 109 deposited on github and made freely available 110 ( https : / / github . com / DuhaimeLab / global _ drinking _ water _ viromes _ Hegarty _ et _ al _ 2021 ) . The 111 UniVec Core database ( as of February 2021 ) was used to remove contamination from vectors 112 ( NCBI , 2016 ) . 113 6 2 . 3 Assembly 114 The filtered and processed reads from each distribution system sampling location were co - 115 assembled using MetaSPAdes v3 . 10 . 1 ( Nurk et al . , 2017 ) . Assembly quality was assessed with 116 QUAST v5 . 0 . 2 ( Gurevich et al . , 2013 ) . 117 2 . 4 Viral Population Identification 118 To define viral populations , putative viral contigs were identified from contigs greater than 3 kb 119 using a strategy based on VirSorter v1 . 0 . 6 ( Roux et al . , 2015a ) , VirSorter2 v2 . 1 ( Guo et al . , 120 2021 ) , CheckV v0 . 7 . 0 ( Nayfach et al . , 2020 ) , VIBRANT v1 . 2 . 1 ( Kieft et al . , 2020 ) , and 121 VirFinder v1 . 1 ( Ren et al . , 2018 ) predictions ( Figure S2 ) . Using the predictions considered high 122 quality by the tools’ authors , any contig classified ( i ) as category 1 or 2 by VirSorter , ( ii ) as high 123 or medium by VIBRANT , ( iii ) as complete , high , or medium by CheckV , ( iv ) with a VirSorter2 124 score greater than 0 . 95 , ( v ) with at least two hallmark viral genes from VirSorter2 , or ( vi ) with a 125 VirFinder score greater than 0 . 9 were considered viral . Additionally , any contig called viral by at 126 least two of the following were considered viral : VirSorter categories 3 - 6 , VIBRANT low , 127 CheckV low , Virfinder score between 0 . 7 and 0 . 9 , and VirSorter2 score between 0 . 5 and 0 . 95 . If 128 a contig had ( i ) no viral genes and more than one host gene according to CheckV , ( ii ) more than 129 3 times as many host genes as viral genes based on CheckV , or ( iii ) a length greater than 50 kb 130 and no viral hallmark genes from VirSorter2 , it was removed from the viral list . Bacterial genes 131 were excised from the edges of proviruses based on their identification by CheckV , VirSorter2 , 132 and VIBRANT . Based on the community - established standard for defining viral populations 133 ( Roux et al . , 2019 ) , all viral contigs were clustered ( stampede - clustergenomes ) ( Roux and 134 7 Bolduc , 2017 ) if they shared average nucleotide identity ( ANI ) of 95 % across 85 % of the contig 135 length ( “viral populations” in the following ) . 136 137 The annotations of the three most ubiquitous VPs ( based on frequency of occurrence and relative 138 abundance ) were examined to assess the confidence of the phage annotations of each of these . 139 These three ubiquitous VPs were blasted against the nucleotide collection ( nt ) in NCBI to assess 140 whether they matched any previously sequenced proviruses . The top hits were run through 141 CheckV to identify any provirus sequences in their genome . 142 2 . 5 Read Mapping 143 Filtered and trimmed reads were mapped to all contigs from that sample’s assembly using 144 Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) and quantified using SAM Tools v1 . 11 ( Li et al . , 145 2009 ) . To quantify the reads mapped to the trimmed viral sequences , BLAST v2 . 9 . 0 ( NCBI , 146 2019 ) was used to align the trimmed viral sequences to the contigs and then reads overlapping 147 this region were quantified using FeatureCounts ( Liao et al . , 2014 ) from the Subread package 148 ( Liao et al . , 2013 ) . When more than one sequencing run was performed for a given sample , the 149 total read coverage was summed across sampling replicates . 150 2 . 6 Alpha and Beta Diversity 151 Only contigs with reads covering at least 3 kb of their length were included in diversity analyses . 152 Alpha diversity measures ( i . e . , richness and Shannon Dissimilarity ) were calculated using the 153 vegan v2 . 5 - 7 package ( Oksanen et al . , 2020 ) in R v4 . 0 . 2 ( R Core Team , 2021 ) . All analyses were 154 performed using RStudio v1 . 3 . 595 ( R Studio Team , 2020 ) . To normalize for differences in 155 8 sequencing depth , taxa per one hundred thousand viral reads ( henceforth , “normalized richness” ) 156 and the Shannon Evenness Index ( calculated by dividing the Shannon Dissimilarity by the 157 maximum possible Shannon Dissimilarity for that sample ) were used to examine alpha diversity 158 trends . 159 160 Transcripts per kilobase million ( TPM ) was determined for each viral population and used to 161 calculate the Bray Curtis distance between samples using the vegandist function . Permutational 162 Multivariate Analysis of Variance ( PERMANOVA ) using the adonis function ( vegan ) was used 163 to test the effect of processing procedures , geography , and residual disinfectant use on the full 164 community structure ( Bray Curtis dissimilarities ~ continent * Köppen zone * filter pore size for 165 biomass collection * DNA extraction method ; with stratas for ‘study’ ) . The effect of ‘study’ and 166 residual disinfectant were also tested in isolation ( Bray Curtis dissimilarities ~ study ; Bray Curtis 167 dissimilarities ~ residual disinfectant ) . 168 169 To avoid the confounding effects of study design and climate on diversity analyses , the Dai et al . 170 ( 2020 ) samples collected in the temperate oceanic climate zone ( Cfb Köppen climate 171 classification scheme ) were used to evaluate the effects of residual disinfectant use on taxonomic 172 diversity and metabolic potential ( Figure S1 inset ) . This study was chosen because it provided 173 detailed water quality parameters and was the only study to include samples from distribution 174 systems operated without a residual disinfectant . The six samples taken from the warm summer 175 continental zone ( Dfb Köppen climate classification ) were excluded because they were all taken 176 from distribution systems that use a residual disinfectant , complicating the isolation of climate’s 177 effect from that of residual disinfectant . Additionally , only samples that used free chlorine ( and 178 9 not chloramines ) were included to facilitate comparison with the results presented by Dai et al . 179 ( 2020 ) . This reduced set of samples was used for all subsequent comparisons of water quality 180 and residual disinfectant . Differences in alpha diversity between distribution systems based on 181 residual disinfectant use were tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test . 182 183 Additionally , both the Sevillano et al . ( 2021 ) and Dai et al ( 2020 ) samples were used to 184 investigate the effects of water quality parameters , including residual disinfectant , on the viral 185 community . These two studies were chosen as the only two to include both samples with and 186 without residual disinfectant . Distance - based Redundancy Analysis ( db - RDA ) was performed 187 using the capscale function in the vegan package v2 . 5 - 7 ( Oksanen et al . , 2020 ) in R ( Bray Curtis 188 dissimilarities ~ chlorine + phosphate + temperature + pH + conductivity + ammonia + nitrate + 189 DO + TOC ) . PERMANOVA was used to test the effect of these water quality parameters and the 190 drinking water distribution system on the viral community structures of the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) 191 samples ( Bray Curtis dissimilarities ~ chlorine + phosphate + temperature + pH + conductivity + 192 ammonia + nitrate + dissolved oxygen ( DO ) + total organic carbon ( TOC ) + drinking water 193 distribution system location ) . Parameters were considered significantly correlated if p - value ≤ 194 0 . 05 . 195 2 . 7 Metabolic Potential Analyses 196 Viral contig gene metabolic annotations were assigned using DRAM based on the KEGG and 197 Pfam databases ( Shaffer et al . , 2020 ) . Read coverages of the open reading frames predicted by 198 DRAM were calculated using FeatureCounts ( Liao et al . , 2014 ) from the Subread package ( Liao 199 et al . , 2013 ) . Bray Curtis distances between samples were calculated using the vegdist function 200 10 and then db - RDA was performed using the capscale function with the vegan package in R ( Bray 201 Curtis dissimilarities ~ chlorine + phosphate + temperature + pH + conductivity + ammonia + 202 nitrate + DO + TOC ) . The water quality parameters were used in a PERMANOVA model to 203 evaluate the effect of water quality parameters on the abundance of KEGG orthologies ( KOs ) , 204 which are molecular function classes that represent the metabolic potential of the viromes . The 205 following equation was used in the adonis function ( vegan ) : Bray Curtis dissimilarities ~ 206 chlorine + phosphate + temperature + pH + conductivity + ammonia + nitrate + DO + TOC + 207 drinking water distribution system location ) . Parameters were considered significantly correlated 208 if p - value ≤ 0 . 05 . KEGG pathway modules were considered more abundant in a condition if the 209 difference in normalized read counts was statistically significant between the two conditions 210 ( Welch’s Two Sample t - test p - value ≤ 0 . 05 ) . 211 2 . 8 Taxonomy 212 The open reading frames ( ORFs ) from DRAM were clustered with all full - length bacterial and 213 archaeal virus genomes from NCBI’s viral reference dataset ( ‘Viral RefSeq’ , v . 85 , January 2018 ) 214 using vConTACT2 ( Bin Jang et al . , 2019 ) . Clusters with at least one taxonomic assignment from 215 vConTACT2 , as well as clusters found in ≥ 10 % of samples , were separately visualized with 216 Cytoscape v3 . 8 . 2 ( Shannon et al . , 2003 ) . The lowest common ancestor was identified for each 217 vContact2 cluster with a taxonomic assignment . 218 3 Results / Discussion 219 To produce a snapshot of the virome in drinking water distribution systems , we mined publicly 220 available drinking water metagenomes ( Chao et al . , 2013 ; Dai et al . , 2020 ; Douterelo et al . , 221 11 2018 ; Garner et al . , 2018 ; Jia et al . , 2015 ; Ma et al . , 2019 , 2017 ; Potgieter et al . , 2020 ; Sevillano 222 et al . , 2021 ; Shi et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Table 1 summarizes the metadata for each 223 study . The majority of the samples were collected in Europe ( 31 % ) and Asia ( 35 % ) , with the 224 remainder obtained from North America ( 23 % ) and Africa ( 11 % ) ( Figure S1 ) . In total , 164 225 samples were collected from 69 distribution systems , with 18 samples from systems with no 226 residual disinfectant and 102 from systems with a residual disinfectant . 46 samples are presumed 227 to be from distribution systems using a residual disinfectant based on the typical disinfection 228 choice of their country of origin ( i . e . , China , Singapore , South Africa , United Kingdom , United 229 States ) , but this could not be confirmed ( Table S1 ) . 230 231 Table 1 - Summary data for the assemblies organized by study . 232 Study Number of Samples Number of Assemblies Filter Pore Size DNA Extraction Method Continent Köppen Zone Residual Disinfectant Chao et al .

We then mined the assembled contigs for viral 236 sequences , identifying 62 , 500 viral sequences , or 9 % of all the contigs longer than 3 kb . The 237 proportion of viral contigs is typically not reported in studies that have mined metagenomes for 238 viral sequences . Our results are in agreement with the upper range ( 0 . 3 - 16 % ) of the percentage 239 of viral sequences observed in a marine metagenome study ( Delong et al . , 2006 ) . Additionally , 240 this is consistent with our expectations that viral genomic material would represent roughly 10 % 241 of community DNA given that viruses are on average an order of magnitude more abundant than 242 their microbial hosts in most aquatic habitats , while their genomes tend to be one to two orders 243 of magnitude smaller . To facilitate comparisons of the viral populations across distribution 244 13 systems , the viral contigs were clustered into 48 , 935 viral populations based on 95 % sequence 245 similarity over 85 % of the contig length ( Roux et al . , 2019 ) . These viral populations allowed us 246 to characterize the taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of the drinking water virome , as 247 well as the geographic and treatment - based factors shaping these communities . 248 3 . 1 Viral ecology of drinking water communities 249 3 . 1 . 1 Drinking water viral populations are predominantly novel and heterogeneous 250 between samples and studies 251 We used vConTACT2 to examine the evolutionary relatedness of the viral populations ( VPs ) . Of 252 the total 62 , 500 viral sequences , 23 , 573 ( 37 % ) formed 7 , 897 clusters that approximate genus - 253 level relatedness ( Bin Jang et al . , 2019 ) ( Figure 1A ; Figure S3 ) . Only 778 viral clusters ( 10 % of 254 all viral clusters ) were given a definitive taxonomic assignment per the International Committee 255 on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) conventions by vConTACT2 ( Figure S4 ) . The vast majority of 256 these , 763 out of the 778 viral clusters , were assigned to families in the Caudovirales order of 257 tailed dsDNA phage . Podoviridae ( 373 VPs ) , Siphoviridae ( 284 ) , and Myoviridae ( 81 ) , were the 258 three most prevalent families of viruses identified in these samples , mirroring the three dominant 259 families in many other freshwater environments ( Moon et al . , 2020 ; Saparbaevna et al . , 2017 ; 260 Skvortsov et al . , 2016 ; Zaouri et al . , 2020 ) . The dominance of Caudovirales among the classified 261 VPs in our study may represent compositional bias towards this viral order , as the vConTACT 262 reference database is 90 % Caudovirales . However , the family classification of our VPs does not 263 reflect database bias , as vConTACT contains 50 % Siphoviridae , 23 % Myoviridae , and 15 % 264 Podoviradae ( Bin Jang et al . , 2019 ) . 265 14 266 To date , the vast majority of VPs described in environmental viromics studies have been novel , 267 reflecting that viral databases insufficiently represent global viral diversity , as well as the fact 268 that the viral genomes reconstructed from these datasets tend to be incomplete and thus difficult 269 to classify . For instance , in recent studies of the Arctic Ocean ( Gregory et al . , 2019 ) , honey bees 270 ( Deboutte et al . , 2020 ) , and New York City wastewater ( Gulino et al . , 2020 ) , only 9 . 8 % , 9 . 5 % , 271 and 4 % of their viral populations , respectively , received a taxonomic assignment . Only 1 % of the 272 drinking water viral populations in our study had a taxonomic assignment ( Fig . 2A ) . Since many 273 viruses are strongly habitat - specific ( Paez - Espino et al . , 2016 ; Roux et al . , 2012 ) , the likelihood 274 of sequencing novel viruses from an environment poorly represented in the databases is high . In 275 addition to the lack of drinking water virome studies to date , the typical source waters ( i . e . , 276 groundwater and surface water ) for drinking water production have been less frequently studied 277 than marine aquatic environments ( Kallies et al . , 2019 ; Kothari et al . , 2021 ; Malki et al . , 2020 ; 278 Moon et al . , 2020 ; Paez - Espino et al . , 2016 ; Roux et al . , 2012 ; Skvortsov et al . , 2016 ) . 279 280 15 281 Figure 1 : Overview of the drinking water viral populations ( VPs ) . ( A ) Status of drinking water 282 VPs after taxonomic clustering by vConTACT2 . VPs that were given a taxonomic assignment by 283 vConTACT2 are in black . ( B ) Network clusters of VPs found in more than 10 % of samples and 284 their connections to viral reference genomes from vConTACT2 . Drinking water VPs are black 285 diamonds and viral reference genomes are colored by family - level taxonomic assignment . ( C ) 286 Number of samples where a VP was abundant ( i . e . , greater than 1 % of reads ) versus the number 287 of samples in which that viral population was found . Only contigs with a relative abundance of 288 greater than 1 % in at least one sample were included in this figure . The three most ubiquitous 289 drinking water viral populations were labeled and further described below . Where multiple 290 points overlap , they have a darker fill . 291 292 Of the 48 , 935 VPs ( 95 % ANI across 85 % of the contig ) identified across all distribution 293 systems , 156 viral populations were found in more than 10 % of the samples . Eight of these had 294 an order - level taxonomic assignment : seven belonged to the Caudovirales order ( two viral 295 populations of Myoviridae , one Podoviridae , two Siphoviridae , two unassigned families ) , and 296 one VP belonged to the Microviridae family of isometric ssDNA phage in the Petitvirales order 297 ( Figure 1B ) . Other studies have similarly found a high degree of heterogeneity with few 298 ubiquitous viral populations across different viromes collected from similar environments ( e . g . , 299 16 within ecological zones in marine environments ) ( Gregory et al . , 2019 ; Paez - Espino et al . , 2016 ; 300 Roux et al . , 2016 ) . 301 302 The three most ubiquitous viral populations were VP _ 905 , VP _ 2791 , and VP _ 1288 ( Figure 1C ) . 303 VP _ 2791 , the most prevalent , was found in 42 % of the samples . VP _ 905 and VP _ 2791 were 304 classified as unknown genera within the Siphoviridae family ( Caudovirales ) . VP _ 1288 did not 305 have a taxonomic assignment at any level . The top blast hits for each of the most ubiquitous VPs 306 in the NCBI nt database ( Table S5 ) were each within prophages identified by CheckV . Both 307 VP _ 905 and VP _ 2971 were most similar ( based on query coverage ) to a sequence in 308 Blastochloris viridis ( Figure 2A , Table S5 ) . B . viridis is a purple photosynthetic bacterium 309 ( Tsukatani et al . , 2015 ) that was isolated from a German river and has been found in other 310 freshwaters , including in the biofilm of an ultrapure supply water plant ( Bohus et al . , 2010 ) . 311 VP _ 905 also matched with a similar query coverage to Rhodobacter sp . LPB0142 ( Figure 2A ) 312 and Paracoccus contaminans . VP _ 1288 was most similar to Nitrobacter winogradskyi , a nitrite 313 oxidizing bacterium that has been found in soils , as well as freshwater ( Mellbye et al . , 2015 ) 314 ( Figure 2B ) . While most of the ORFs on the three contigs were not assigned a metabolic 315 annotation ( Figure 2 ; Table S6 ) , the high number of unknown and phage - related genes , 316 combined with the high sequence similarity and synteny with known prophages , increased the 317 confidence that each are truly phage contigs . By pairing deeply - sequenced viromes with cellular 318 metagenomes , subsequent studies will build on this first report of ubiquitous viral populations in 319 drinking water to establish “who infects whom” , thereby leading to a more robust understanding 320 of how viruses impact drinking water quality . 321 322 17 323 Figure 2 : Genome comparisons of the three most globally ubiquitous drinking water viral 324 populations ( VPs ) with the known sequences ( NCBI nt ) that share the greatest percent coverage 325 ( blastn ) .

In contrast to differences reported between viruses sequenced from 0 . 1 - 20 µm and < 0 . 1 336 µm fractions ( Williamson et al . , 2012 ) , our meta - analysis found that filter pore size did not 337 impact viral community structures ( PERMANOVA ; Table S7 ) . As virus sizes typically range 338 from 0 . 02 - 0 . 3 µm , the relatively large filter pore size ( 0 . 22 µm and 0 . 45 µm ) used across all 339 studies in our analysis may explain why filter pore size did not affect viral community structure . 340 18 The other three parameters tested , as well as the interaction of the DNA extraction method and 341 Köppen climate zone , did have a statistically significant effect on the viral community’s structure 342 ( PERMANOVA ; Table S7 ) . Combined , the parameters and their interactions tested explained 343 slightly over a quarter of the variability in the system ( residual PERMANOVA R 2 = 0 . 73 ; Table 344 S7 ) . The inability to explain the full variability in beta diversity in the PERMANOVA model 345 could reflect the unbalanced nature of the metadata ( e . g . , many more samples used the Maxwell 346 16 DNA extraction system than the other three methods ; Figure S4 ) , as well as the importance of 347 additional factors . 348 349 We additionally tested the effect of ‘study’ to encompass the experimental design and 350 environmental conditions , including those not explicitly reported in all of the original 351 metagenomics studies ( e . g . , water source , distribution system water qualities , library 352 preparation ) . ‘Study’ was found to significantly impact the viral community structure 353 ( PERMANOVA R 2 = 0 . 21 , p - value = 0 . 0001 ) . In a previous meta - analysis of drinking water 354 bacterial communities , ‘study’ - specific effects explained nearly a third of the variability among 355 samples ( Bautista - de los Santos et al . , 2016 ) . The collection and processing of samples are 356 known to have a substantial impact on the viruses identified ( Brinkman et al . , 2018 ; Dias et al . , 357 2020 ; Hurwitz et al . , 2013 ; Percival and Wyn - Jones , 2013 ) . The low biomass of drinking water 358 samples may make them particularly prone to the influence of ‘study’ - specific differences from 359 contamination during sample processing ( Bautista - de los Santos et al . , 2016 ) . Alternatively , as 360 most studies only examined one distribution system or focused on a single region , the strong 361 ‘study’ - specific effects may be partly due to local factors , such as geography , climate , treatment 362 19 regime , and water source ( e . g . , groundwater , river water ) . Such parameters have been shown to 363 influence the viral communities of many other environments ( Paez - Espino et al . , 2016 ) . 364 365 366 Figure 3 : Diversity of viral populations cluster based on residual disinfectant use and water quality . 367 dbRDA ordination of the Bray Curtis dissimilarities of the viral community structure for ( A ) Dai et al . 368 ( 2020 ) and ( B ) Sevillano et al ( 2021 ) samples . Distribution system is represented by shape and residual 369 disinfectant use by color . The ordination is overlaid with the gradient of the fit between the measured 370 environmental parameters and the viral community dissimilarities . Only samples from distribution 371 systems using chlorine in the Cfb Köppen climate zone from the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) study were included in 372 4A . 373 374 20 To investigate the influence of water quality parameters independently from study - specific 375 effects , we focused on the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) samples , collected from the UK and Netherlands , and 376 the Sevillano et al . ( 2021 ) samples , collected from Puerto Rico . Both studies found that chlorine 377 was a major determinant of the differences in the microbial community composition ( Dai et al . , 378 2020 ; Sevillano et al . , 2021 ) . Dai et al . ( 2020 ) additionally found that DO and conductivity were 379 correlated with the microbial community structure of these samples ; Sevillano et al . ( 2021 ) found 380 that DO , temperature , and TOC were each significantly associated with changes in microbial 381 composition at specific sites . As bacterial community structure is a critical driver of 382 bacteriophage community structure ( Gregory et al . , 2019 ; Jonge et al . , 2018 ) , we hypothesized 383 that these parameters would also be correlated with the viral community relatedness ( Bray Curtis 384 dissimilarities ) . We found that viral beta diversity ( i . e . , differences in community structure 385 between samples ) correlated with chlorine , phosphate , and nitrate concentration , DO , 386 conductivity , water temperature , pH , and TOC for both studies ; ammonia concentration was also 387 significantly correlated for the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) samples ( Figure 3 ; Tables S8 and S9 ) . These 388 trends indicated that water quality parameters do likely shape the viral communities of drinking 389 water . Distribution system sampling location was significantly correlated with the viral 390 community structure of both the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) study ( PERMANOVA R 2 = 0 . 33 , p - 391 value = 0 . 001 ; Table S8 ) and Sevillano et al . ( 2021 ) study ( PERMANOVA R 2 = 0 . 32 , p - 392 value = 0 . 0001 ; Table S9 ) . Together with the unexplained variability in both the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) 393 ( PERMANOVA R 2 = 0 . 19 ; Table S8 ) and the Sevillano et al . ( 2021 ) samples ( PERMANOVA 394 R 2 = 0 . 25 ; Table S9 ) , these trends indicated that unmeasured factors also likely affected the viral 395 community structures . Altogether , the Sevillano et al . ( 2021 ) and Dai et al . ( 2020 ) viral 396 21 sequences suggest that water quality parameters are influencing the structure of viral 397 communities independently of study - specific differences in experimental design . 398 3 . 1 . 3 Systems with residual disinfectant have less diverse and less even viral 399 communities 400 To assess the effect of residual disinfectant on the viral communities , we first assessed within - 401 sample diversity ( alpha diversity ) . The average normalized viral richness was 350 ± 820 and the 402 average Shannon evenness index was 0 . 28 ± 0 . 10 . The Shannon dissimilarities for the drinking 403 water viral populations range from 0 . 26 - 7 . 7 , which is consistent with ranges reported for other 404 freshwater sources ( Aguirre De Cárcer et al . , 2015 ; Tseng et al . , 2013 ) . Distribution systems that 405 used a residual disinfectant had less diverse viral communities than distribution systems that did 406 not use a residual disinfectant . This trend held for systems using both chlorine and chloramine , 407 as well as for the suspected residual disinfectant samples ( Tukey’s test p adj ≤ 10 - 6 ; Figure S5 ) . 408 Further , no difference was found between the chlorine and chloramine samples ( Tukey’s test p adj 409 = 0 . 92 ) , nor between the suspected residual disinfectant samples and either the chlorine ( Tukey’s 410 test p ad j = 0 . 25 ) or chloramine ( Tukey’s test p adj = 0 . 85 ) samples . Together , these trends supported 411 our prediction that samples from studies with suspected residual disinfectant usage were indeed 412 likely obtained from systems operated with a residual disinfectant . 413 414 415 Bacterial communities in drinking water systems with residual disinfectant have been observed 416 to have lower richness and evenness ( Bautista - de los Santos et al . , 2016 ; Dai et al . , 2020 ) . Dai et 417 al . ( 2020 ) proposed that disinfectant residuals exert a stronger selective pressure than the low 418 phosphate and ammonia availability in distribution systems that do not use a residual 419 22 disinfectant . For the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) samples , we similarly found that viral communities in 420 drinking water distribution systems with a residual disinfectant ( i . e . , free chlorine ) were less 421 diverse and less even than distribution systems without a residual disinfectant ( Wilcoxon rank 422 sum test p - values : normalized richness p - value = 3 . 0 * 10 - 6 and Shannon evenness index p - value = 423 0 . 001 ; Figure 4 ) . Correlations between bacterial and viral diversity have been observed in a 424 range of environments ( Anderson et al . , 2017 ; Dalcin Martins et al . , 2018 ; Yang et al . , 2019 ) . 425 Whether residual disinfectant selects for certain viral populations in drinking water , thereby 426 reducing viral community diversity , or the viral population dynamics are following those of their 427 bacterial hosts as they are affected by residual disinfectant and other changing environmental 428 parameters , is unknown . As phages impose a selective pressure on bacterial communities , phages 429 can both disrupt desirable bacterial communities during industrial processes ( e . g . , yogurt 430 production ) , as well as be used to prevent contamination by pathogens ( e . g . , to prevent milk 431 spoilage ) ( Marks and Sharp , 2000 ) . Based on the abundance and diversity of phages in drinking 432 water , we hypothesize that phages are an important factor influencing the stability of bacterial 433 communities in drinking water . However , more systematic and deeply sequenced analyses of 434 paired cellular and viral metagenomes is needed to better resolve virus , host , and infection 435 dynamics in drinking water distribution systems and their consequences for water quality . 436 437 23 438 Figure 4 - Viral diversity varied based on whether samples originated from distribution systems that use 439 or do not use a residual disinfectant . ( A ) Observed normalized viral richness and ( B ) Shannon Evenness 440 Index of the viral community of each sample . Note that only samples from the Cfb Köppen climate zone 441 and samples with chlorine as the residual disinfectant from the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) study were included . 442 443 Residual disinfectant is also a significant determinant of between - sample bacterial community 444 structure ( Bautista - de los Santos et al . , 2016 ; Dai et al . , 2020 ) , e . g . , beta diversity . Therefore , we 445 anticipated it to have a similar effect on viral community structure . The viral communities from 446 the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) study clustered based on residual disinfectant use ( PERMANOVA R 2 = 0 . 09 , 447 p - value = 0 . 0001 ; Figure 3A ) . While the Dai et al . ( 2020 ) samples considered were all taken from 448 the same Köppen climatic zone , the residual disinfectant samples were taken in the summer / fall 449 and have lower conductivities and the no residual disinfectant samples were taken during the 450 winter / spring and have higher conductivities ( Tables S2 , S10 ) . For this reason , the differences in 451 viral community structure may reflect the additive effect of water quality differences that reflect 452 treatment ( e . g . , chlorine , phosphate , DO , ammonia ) and other factors that may confound the 453 effect of treatment , such as season and water source ( e . g . , temperature and conductivity ) . Both 454 season ( Pinto et al . , 2014 ; Potgieter et al . , 2018 ; Prest et al . , 2016 ) and water source ( Assche et 455 al . , 2019 ; Roeselers et al . , 2015 ) have been shown to influence drinking water microbial 456 communities . When season and water source have been examined together , systems that are 457 24 groundwater fed have lacked the strong seasonal trends observed in surface water fed systems 458 ( Assche et al . , 2019 ; Roeselers et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , season may have a weaker confounding 459 effect than source water for the no residual disinfectant samples , as their conductivities suggest 460 groundwater sources ( Douterelo et al . , 2018 ) . 461 462 Providing an additional opportunity to consider the effect of residual disinfectant , one site from 463 the Sevillano et al . ( 2021 ) study , GUA , had chlorine concentrations below the detection limit or 464 much lower than the other sites ( chlorine concentration < 0 . 05 mg / L ) . The viral community 465 structure of the GUA samples was distinct compared to the other samples ( PERMANOVA 466 R 2 = 0 . 18 , p - value = 0 . 0002 ; Figure 3B ) , including those that had similar conductivities , 467 temperatures , and other water quality parameters . While this further supports the influence of 468 residual disinfectant on viral community structure , more studies are necessary to determine the 469 distinct effects of residual disinfectant use on the viral communities of drinking water 470 distribution systems separate from season and water source . 471 3 . 2 The metabolic potential of drinking water viromes 472 Viral genomes often include genes necessary for replication , as well as host - derived auxiliary 473 metabolic genes ( AMGs ) thought to reprogram host cellular metabolism to support infection 474 processes ( Warwick - Dugdale et al . , 2019 ) . Characterizing and understanding the influences on 475 the metabolic potential of drinking water viruses is , therefore , an essential step in understanding 476 their influence on the cellular members of the drinking water microbiome . 477 25 3 . 2 . 1 Water quality parameters are correlated with differences in viral community 478 metabolic potential 479 The viral community metabolic potential varies with water quality parameters in similar ways to 480 the viral community structure . Specifically , samples clustered primarily by disinfectant status 481 ( Figure 5A ) and all tested water quality parameters correlated with the metabolic profiles of 482 samples from systems using residual disinfectant , other than DO ( Figure 7 ; PERMANOVA 483 Table S11 ) . Furthermore , the strong correlation between metabolic profiles and drinking water 484 distribution system ( PERMANOVA R 2 = 0 . 30 , p - value = 0 . 001 ) and large degree of unexplained 485 variability ( residual PERMANOVA R 2 = 0 . 21 ) suggested that much of the metabolic variability 486 was due to unreported water quality and treatment specific differences . Unlike the viral 487 populations , which were more diverse in distribution systems with no residual disinfectant , there 488 was more diversity in metabolic potential in the residual disinfectant systems ( Wilcoxon rank 489 sum test p - value = 0 . 03 ; Figure S6 ) . This may reflect an evolutionary benefit of carrying extra 490 genes to survive the oxidative stress of residual disinfectant presence . 491 492 26 493 Figure 5 : Metabolic potential of the drinking water virome . ( A ) dbRDA ordination reveals that the 494 diversity of metabolic potential clusters based on residual disinfectant use and water quality . The shape 495 of the points represents the distribution system , and the color represents the residual disinfectant . The 496 ordination is overlaid with the gradient of the fit between the measured environmental parameters and 497 the Bray Curtis dissimilarities . ( B ) KEGG Ontology ( KO ) Pathway module relative abundance for the 498 samples from Dai et al ( 2020 ) . The size of the bubble represents the relative abundance of that pathway 499 module among the reads in that sample . Only samples from the Cfb Köppen climate zone from the Dai et 500 al . ( 2020 ) study were included in A and B . ( C ) Most abundant protein families ( Pfam ) . The percent of 501 genes is the percentage of the number of genes with a specific Pfam annotation divided by the total 502 number of genes with a Pfam annotation . Only those Pfams with a percentage greater than 0 . 5 % are 503 shown . Bars are colored based on whether they were phage non - structural , phage structural , or genes of 504 unknown function . Figures 6A and 6B only includes the samples from distribution systems using chlorine 505 and from the Cfb Köppen climate zone . 506 507 27 508 The relative abundance of KO metabolic pathway modules also differed between distribution 509 systems that used a residual disinfectant and those that did not ( Figure 5B , Table S12 ) . Viral 510 contigs from distribution systems that did not use a residual disinfectant were enriched in genes 511 with nucleotide metabolism annotations . Contrastingly , viral contigs from distribution systems 512 that used a residual disinfectant were enriched in genes involving the metabolism of cofactors 513 and vitamins and for xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism . The higher availability of 514 genes related to these two pathway modules in residual disinfectant systems may reflect the 515 evolutionary pressure to carry genes capable of mitigating the effects of reactive chlorine species 516 ( Huang et al . , 2021 ; Kavagutti et al . , 2019 ) . However , these trends , particularly the 517 overabundance of nucleotide metabolism in no residual disinfectant systems , could potentially be 518 an artifact of the increased diversity of these samples ( Figure 4 ) . As more than 85 % of the KOs 519 were found in less than a quarter of the samples ( Figure S7 ) , further studies with deeper 520 sequencing or viral - enriched genomes are necessary to robustly investigate differential 521 abundances of molecular functions . 522 3 . 2 . 2 Drinking water viruses encode metabolic genes with the potential to augment 523 microbial metabolic processes 524 As is common in other environmental viromes ( Deboutte et al . , 2020 ; Gregory et al . , 2019 ) , most 525 of the predicted viral genes identified in this study were novel , meaning they do not share 526 homology with known genes in public databases . As a result , only 25 % had a Pfam annotation 527 and 6 % could be assigned a KEGG orthology ( KO ) molecular function . Of the six most 528 prevalent Pfams , two were phage structural protein families and four were phage non - structural 529 28 proteins ( Figure 5C ) . The most abundant was a Caudovirus prohead serine protease 530 ( PF04586 . 18 ) , an enzyme involved in capsid maturation . The ubiquity of viral - related 531 annotations among the most abundant Pfams supports that viral contigs were successfully sorted 532 from the majority cellular metagenomes . 533 534 The top four most abundant KO metabolic modules were nucleotide metabolism ( 44 % of the 535 reads that mapped to viral genes with KO annotations ) , cofactors and vitamins metabolism 536 ( 18 % ) , amino acid metabolism ( 11 % ) , and carbohydrate metabolism ( 10 % ) . Genes related to 537 nucleotide and amino acid metabolism are commonly abundant in viral genomes , due to their 538 importance in viral replication ( Hurwitz et al . , 2015 ) . Carbohydrate metabolism genes carried by 539 viruses may be involved in reprogramming central carbon metabolism to favor energy 540 production necessary for viral replication ( Howard - Varona et al . , 2020 ) . In the oligotrophic 541 environment of the drinking water microbiome , these genes , along with those encoding for 542 proteins related to cofactor and vitamin metabolism , might contribute to the survival of the 543 bacteriophages’ hosts or enhance viral replication . 544 545 Nitrogen metabolism genes are common among drinking water bacteria ( Potgieter et al . , 2020 ) to 546 survive the oligotrophic conditions of drinking water ( Kooij and Wielen , 2013 ) . In other 547 nitrogen - limited environments , phages have carried more genes related to nitrogen cycling 548 ( Warwick - Dugdale et al . , 2019 ) . Similarly , genes related to nitrogen metabolism were identified 549 in the drinking water virome in this study ( Figure S8 ) , including carbonic anhydrase ( K01673 ) , 550 glutamine synthetase ( K01915 ) , nitrate reductase / nitrite oxidoreductase ( K00370 ) , glutamate 551 dehydrogenase ( K15371 ) , nitric oxide reductase ( K04748 ) , nitrate / nitrite transporter ( K02575 ) , 552 29 and nitrogen fixation protein NifU ( K04488 ) . The most ubiquitous nitrogen metabolism related 553 genes were glutamine synthetase ( K01915 ; 11 assemblies ) , followed by NifU ( K04488 ; 8 554 assemblies ) . In addition to being part of nitrogen metabolism , glutamine synthetase is also 555 involved in amino acid metabolism . The presence of viral encoded nitrogen - related genes 556 suggests that in drinking water distribution systems , viruses may impact nutrient metabolism , 557 either through rewiring host metabolism to support infection or by mediating horizontal gene 558 transfer of nutrient - stress related genes ( Warwick - Dugdale et al . , 2019 ; Zimmerman et al . , 2020 ) . 559 560 To survive in drinking water systems with a residual disinfectant , microorganisms must also 561 mitigate the effects of reactive chlorine species ( Gray et al . , 2013 ) . In this study , glutathione 562 reductase ( K00383 ) and genes responsible for four of the five steps of coenzyme A biosynthesis 563 ( M00120 ; Figure S9 ) were identified in the viruses of distribution systems that use a residual 564 disinfectant ( 59 samples in 5 studies ) . Low molecular weight thiols , including glutathione and 565 coenzyme A , which maintain the reducing potential of the cytosol ( Chesney and Eaton , 1996 ) , 566 have previously been found in bacterial genomes from drinking water distribution systems 567 treated with chlorine ( Dai et al . , 2020 ; Douterelo et al . , 2018 ; Gomez - Alvarez et al . , 2012 ) . In 568 other environments , genes broadly involved in surviving oxidative stress have been found in 569 phage genomes ( Huang et al . , 2021 ; Kavagutti et al . , 2019 ) and have been shown to be beneficial 570 to viral fitness ( Holmgren , 1989 ; Russel and Model , 1986 ) . While viral genes are implicated in 571 combating oxidative stress in distribution systems using a residual disinfectant , additional 572 research is needed to assess the role of viruses in mitigating the harmful effects of reactive 573 chlorine species in drinking water , specifically . 574 575 30 Taken together , the presence of genes related to nitrogen metabolism and oxidative stress 576 mitigation on drinking water viral contigs suggest that phages may contribute to the transfer of 577 genes that are important for microbial survival in drinking water distribution systems . 578 3 . 3 Opportunities for Future Work 579 Metagenomic analyses allow researchers to make broad assessments of microbial communities 580 and suggest areas for more targeted studies . The analyses conducted here suggest that residual 581 disinfectant use impacts the diversity and metabolic potential of the drinking water virome . 582 However , future bench - scale experiments will be necessary to separate the effects of residual 583 disinfectant from other water quality and sampling differences . Confounding methodological 584 differences between studies , such as DNA extraction method , can mask or be correlated with the 585 factors , including climate , geography , and treatment regime , that may shape the microbial 586 communities of drinking water . While standardizing methodologies may be impossible and 587 premature , coordination between researchers could facilitate cross - study comparisons ( Bautista - 588 de los Santos et al . , 2016 ; Hull et al . , 2019 ) . An excellent first step would be to make raw 589 sequencing data public and report temperature , water quality characteristics ( e . g . , chlorine , 590 phosphate , ammonia , nitrate , TOC concentrations ) , and biomass proxies ( e . g . , ATP levels , cell 591 counts ) , as well as other metadata ( e . g . , source water characteristics , details of the treatment , 592 season , location ) ( Bautista - de los Santos et al . , 2016 ; Yilmaz et al . , 2011 ) . Application of 593 standardized spike - ins , such as “sequins” ( Hardwick et al . , 2018 ) , to drinking water microbiomes 594 would further facilitate between study comparisons , as well as reveal whether the changes in 595 viral gene relative abundances described in this work mirror the trends in absolute abundance . 596 597 31 For the most robust assessments of the drinking water virome , future studies must specifically 598 develop sample processing methods that enrich for viruses and are optimized for the sample 599 matrix ( Langenfeld et al . , 2021 ) . As the drinking water samples of this meta - analysis were not 600 collected with the intention of enriching for submicron viral particles , the sequenced viruses may 601 be biased towards particle - associated viruses , viruses actively infecting a cellular host , and free 602 viruses trapped by the chosen filter . Future studies designed specifically to query the viral 603 fraction of drinking water ( including both DNA and RNA viruses ) and with deeper sequencing 604 efforts are necessary to determine whether the trends described here are reflective of the full viral 605 community . To more fully capture both the drinking water viral community and their influences 606 on bacterial communities , future studies should also explore viruses in drinking water biofilms . 607 As part of this effort , future work should characterize the viral genes that are on DNA within 608 viral particles , as compared to extracellular DNA . Altogether , these studies will also determine 609 the extent to which phage - facilitated metabolic reprogramming or gene transfer contributes to 610 bacterial survival in drinking water systems . By connecting the drinking water virome’s 611 dynamics with that of the bacterial community , improved treatment processes may become 612 possible . 613 4 Conclusions 614 - Mining drinking water metagenomes for viral sequences reveals differences in the viral 615 community based on geography and water quality parameters . 616 - More diverse and even viral communities are found in distribution systems that do not 617 use a residual disinfectant . 618 32 - Viruses in drinking water carry genes , such as those for nitrogen metabolism and chlorine 619 stress mitigation , that mirror those identified as critical for the drinking water bacterial 620 community . 621 Acknowledgements 622 We would like to thank the Remaking Water Infrastructure Blue Sky team , particularly Sarah 623 Potgieter , Christopher Anderson , and Katherine Dowdell , as well as the Duhaime and Wigginton 624 labs for contributing their technical and intellectual expertise for bioinformatic experimental 625 design and analyses and manuscript preparation .
