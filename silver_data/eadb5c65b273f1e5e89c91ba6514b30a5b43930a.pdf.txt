Analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochores has shown that they are complex struc - tures containing > 50 protein components . Many of these yeast proteins have orthologs in animal cells , suggesting that key aspects of kinetochore structure have been conserved through evolution , despite the remarkable differences between the 125 - base pair centromeres of budding yeast and the Mb centromeres of animal cells . We describe here an analysis of S . cerevisiae Ndc10p , one of the four protein components of the CBF3 complex . CBF3 binds to the CDEIII element of centromeric DNA and initiates kinetochore assembly . Whereas CDEIII binding by Ndc10p requires the other components of CBF3 , Ndc10p can bind on its own to CDEII , a region of centromeric DNA with no known binding partners . Ndc10p - CDEII binding involves a dispersed set of sequence - selective and - nonselective contacts over (cid:1) 80 base pairs of DNA , suggesting formation of a multimeric structure . CDEII - like sites , active in Ndc10p binding , are also present along chromosome arms . We propose that a polymeric Ndc10p complex formed on CDEII and CDEIII DNA is the foundation for recruiting microtubule attachment proteins to kinetochores . A similar type of polymeric structure on chromosome arms may mediate other chromosome – spindle interactions . INTRODUCTION Accurate chromosome segregation depends on the attach - ment of microtubules to kinetochores , protein – DNA com - plexes assembled on centromeric DNA . During mitosis , each sister chromatid must assemble one and only one kineto - chore . Chromatids lacking kinetochores cannot be pulled into daughter cells at anaphase , whereas those with two or more kinetochores are in danger of being pulled in two directions at once and becoming torn . Correct chromosome segregation therefore requires proper regulation of kineto - chore assembly . Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an attractive organism in which to study kinetochore assembly because it contains particu - larly short centromeres . A 125 - base pair CEN sequence is necessary and sufﬁcient to mediate accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis ( Clarke and Carbon , 1980 ; Cottarel et al . , 1989 ) . In contrast , Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromeres are 40 – 100 kb in length , and human centromeres span megabases ( Bloom , 1993 ) . Despite the dra - matic difference in the complexity of centromeric DNA among different eukaryotes , there is good evidence that many kinetochore proteins have been conserved through evolution ( Dobie et al . , 1999 ) . It is therefore reasonable to expect that lessons learned in yeast will be of general im - portance for the study of chromosome segregation in other organisms . The 16 centromeres in S . cerevisiae contain three conserved DNA elements : CDEI , CDEII , and CDEIII ( reviewed in He - gemann and Fleig , 1993 ) . CDEI is not essential for centro - mere function , but both CDEII and CDEIII are . CDEI is the binding site for the Cbf1 protein ( Cai and Davis , 1989 ; Jiang and Philippsen , 1989 ; Mellor et al . , 1990 ) and CDEIII is the binding site for the four - protein CBF3 complex ( Ng and Carbon , 1987 ; Lechner and Carbon , 1991 ) . Both CDEI and CDEIII contain highly conserved bases in which point mu - tations impair protein binding and centromere function ( Niedenthal et al . , 1991 ; McGrew et al . , 1986 ; Ng and Carbon , 1987 ; Hegemann et al . , 1988 ) . CDEII has no known binding partners but it has a conserved length ( 78 – 84 bases ) and high A - T composition ( (cid:2) 90 % ; Clarke and Carbon , 1980 ) . CBF3 is the most extensively studied kinetochore complex in budding yeast ( Lechner and Carbon , 1991 ; Goh and Kilmartin , 1993 ; Sorger et al . , 1995 ; Strunnikov et al . , 1995 ; Connelly and Hieter , 1996 ; Espelin et al . , 1997 ) and seems to be required for the initiation of kinetochore assembly ( Kaplan et al . , 1997 ; Russell et al . , 1999 ) . S . cerevisiae kineto - chores are characterized by a hierarchy of protein – DNA and protein – protein contacts , and all known kinetochore pro - teins require CBF3 activity for in vivo association with cen - tromeric DNA . CBF3 contains four protein subunits : Ndc10p , Cep3p , Ctf13p , and Skp1p , all of which are neces - sary for DNA binding and for cell viability . Three CBF3 proteins , Ndc10p , Cep3p , and Ctf13p are in direct contact Article published online ahead of print . Mol . Biol . Cell 10 . 1091 / mbc . E02 – 08 – 0533 .

E - mail address : psorger @ mit . edu . © 2003 by The American Society for Cell Biology 4557 with DNA , as judged by DNA cross - linking in vitro ( Espelin et al . , 1997 ) . The fourth , Skp1p , mediates the phosphoryla - tion - dependent activation of Ctf13p ( Kaplan et al . , 1997 ) . Although CDEII is essential ( Panzeri et al . , 1985 ; Gaudet and Fitzgerald - Hayes , 1987 ) , it has no previously identiﬁed protein ligands . The experiments described here show that Ndc10p is a sequence - speciﬁc CDEII DNA binding protein . Although CDEIII binding by Ndc10p requires the three other members of the CBF3 protein complex , CDEII binding does not . Linker - scanning mutagenesis of CDEII reveals that sequences across a roughly 80 - base pair region are involved in protein – DNA recognition with a particularly important site near the center . Mutations in this sequence signiﬁcantly decrease the ﬁdelity of chromosome segregation . We there - fore propose that Ndc10p has two functions at kinetochores , one as an essential component of CBF3 and a second as a CDEII - binding factor . MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation Ndc10p , Ctf13p / Skp1p , and Cep3p - containing extracts were prepared from nuclear lysates of baculovirus - infected Hi5 insect cells ( Kaplan et al . , 1997 ) . These extracts were analyzed in bandshift assays with radiolabeled probes , as described previously ( Sorger et al . , 1995 ) . To purify Ndc10p , Hi5 cell lysates were prepared 36 h postinfection , centrifuged to remove particulate material , and applied to a cation exchange POROS HQ column ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) in 150 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 20 mM (cid:1) - glycero - phosphate , 20 mM NaF , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % (cid:1) - mercaptoethanol and eluted with 600 mM KCl in the same buffer . Fractions containing Ndc10p were collected and the KCl concentration adjusted to 150 mM . The pooled fractions were then applied to an anion - exchange POROS HS column ( Applied Bio - systems ) and eluted with 600 mM KCl . Fractions were again pooled on the basis of Ndc10p amount as judged by SDS - PAGE . Anti - myc antibody ( 9E10 ) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . Plasmids and Probes Bandshift probes were generated as described previously ( Espelin et al . , 1997 ) from subcloned fragments in plasmids or directly from genomic DNA . CEN3 mutants were generated from pRN505 as follows : the CDEI M probe includes a CDEI mutation from CACATG to CATTATG and CDEIII M probes delete the central CCG of CDEIII ( Sorger et al . , 1995 ) . Probes for the experiments in Figure 2 were generated using PCR “mega - priming” with the ﬁnal products subcloned into vectors and sequenced . A fragment of the tetracycline resis - tance gene from pBR322 was used as a source of “random” DNA in substi - tution and linker scanning mutations . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) was performed as described previously ( Megee et al . , 1999 ; Tanaka et al . , 1999 ) . Strains and Chromosome Loss Assay Yeast strains were derived from W303 ( MATa , ade2 - 1 , trp1 - 1 , can1 - 100 , leu2 - 3112 , his3 - 11 , 15 , ura3 , GAL , psi (cid:3) ) . The strain harboring Ndc10p - myc6 was produced by transformation of W303 by NDC10 - myc6 : : TRP1 ( gift of S . Piatti , Universita degli Studi di Milano - Bicocca , Italy ) . The Mcd1p - myc18 strain was a gift of the Nasmyth laboratory ( K6565 : W303 MATa , ade2 - 1 , can1 - 100 , leu2 - 3112 , GAL , psi (cid:3) , MCD1 - myc18 : : TRP1 ) . Strains for chromosome loss as - says were generated as described previously ( Clarke et al . , 1983 ) by trans - forming W303 haploid cells with constructs containing variant CEN sequence and a linked URA3 marker and subsequent mating with cells of the opposite mating type . Correct integrations were conﬁrmed by PCR genotyping . The chromosome loss assay was performed as follows : cells were grown in selective media ( SD - URA ) and then plated immediately ( t (cid:4) 0 ) or grown under nonselective conditions for 7 or 13 generations in YPD before plating on SD - URA and YPD . Results shown are the average of three separate cultures and 200 – 400 colonies analyzed for each strain . Generations were monitored by OD 600 and cell number . Cells were counted by hemacytometer for plating . The fraction of Ura (cid:3) cells was determined from the ratio of colonies obtained by plating on SD - URA and YPD . ( Analysis was also performed using 5 - ﬂuoro - orotic acid SD - complete plates with similar results . PCR analysis of several randomly chosen colonies from 5 - ﬂuoro - orotic acid plates conﬁrmed loss of the chromosome carrying the CDEII mutation ; our unpublished data ) . Pattern Identiﬁcation Program To analyze CDEII sequences , a program was written that applies a sliding , nonoverlapping window of 80 nucleotides ( similar in length to CDEII ) to the sequence of Chromosome III ; this analysis uncovered 71 sites of high A - T composition ( (cid:2) 80 % ) . Four of these sites were selected at random for bandshift analysis ( Figure 3 , lanes c , j , o , and x ) along with a randomly selected chromosomal site as a control ( Figure 3 , lane w ) . Bandshift probes were 200 bases in length and covered the 80 - base pair CDEII - matched property win - dow along with 60 ﬂanking bases on both sides . The probability of a partic - ular A (cid:3) T composition is derived from the distribution observed in the yeast genome . Regions of DNA containing stretches of poly - A or poly - T were compared with each other by using simulation : for a particular content of adenine , the sequence was randomized and number of stretches counted ; from this distribution probabilities were determined . We compute that CDEII - like sites occur on average every (cid:1) 5 kb . RESULTS Ndc10p Binds to CDEII To identify proteins that associate speciﬁcally with CDEII DNA , we performed in vitro binding experiments using wild - type and variant CEN3 probes that cover different re - gions of the S . cerevisiae centromere ( Figure 1A ) . Both whole - cell lysates from S . cerevisiae and recombinant kinetochore proteins expressed in insect cells were used as sources of potential centromere - binding proteins . Consistent with our previous ﬁndings , when insect cell extracts containing re - combinant Ndc10p , Cep3p or Ctf13p - Skp1p were mixed and incubated with an 88 - base pair CDEIII probe ( probe 2 ) , we observed a rapidly migrating CBF3 species and a second more slowly migrating species ( Figure 1B , lane 1 ; Espelin et al . , 1997 ) . Both of these complexes contain all four CBF3 subunits but the fast - migrating species has a single Ndc10p dimer , whereas the slow - migrating species has two dimers . As expected , we saw no complexes when extracts containing only one or two CBF3 proteins were present in the binding reaction ( Figure 1B , lanes 2 – 4 ; Kaplan et al . , 1997 ) . A strik - ingly different result was obtained with a 184 - base pair probe spanning all of CEN3 ( probe 1 ) . When Ndc10p alone was mixed with probe 1 , several distinct DNA – protein com - plexes formed ( Figure 1C , lanes 7 – 9 ) but none was detected with Ctf13p - Skp1p alone or Cep3 alone ( Figure 1C , lanes 5 and 6 ) . Moreover , complexes did not form when Ndc10p was incubated with a randomly selected fragment of pUC19 ( Figure 1C , lane 10 ) , suggesting that the Ndc10p – probe 1 complex is sequence selective . To measure this sequence selectivity , mixed sequence salmon sperm DNA was titrated into Ndc10p - probe 1 binding reactions . Binding of Ndc10p to CEN3 DNA ( 50 fM ) was 50 % inhibited at a salmon sperm DNA concentration of 20 mg / ml ( our unpublished data ) . Thus , mixed sequence DNA can compete with probe DNA for Ndc10p binding only at very high concentrations . The microscopic sequence selectivity for Ndc10p binding to CEN3 , relative to mixed sequence DNA , is (cid:1) 2 (cid:5) 10 5 . This is 10 - fold lower than that of CBF3 for CDEIII ( Espelin et al . , 1997 ) but typical for many sequence - speciﬁc DNA binding proteins . From these data , we conclude that Ndc10p binds in a sequence - selective manner to intact CEN3 DNA in the absence of other proteins but does not bind to DNA con - taining only CDEIII , the binding site for CBF3 . Point mutations in CDEI or CDEIII disrupt association with Cbf1p and CBF3 , respectively ( McGrew et al . , 1986 ; Ng and Carbon , 1987 ; Baker and Masison , 1990 ; Cai and Davis , 1990 ; Neidenthal et al . , 1991 ) . Incorporation of these muta - tions into CEN3 either singly ( probes 3 and 4 ) or in combi - nation ( probe 5 ) had no detectable effect on Ndc10p binding ( Figure 1D , lanes 12 – 14 ) . However , when an 85 - base pair fragment of plasmid DNA was inserted in place of 85 - base pairs of CDEII , Ndc10p binding was abolished ( Figure 1D , lane 15 ) . This result suggests that Ndc10p binds to sequences in CDEII in a sequence - speciﬁc manner . To investigate C . W . Espelin et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 4558 whether CDEII is sufﬁcient for Ndc10p binding , we used a 127 - base pair sequence comprising only wild - type CDEI (cid:3) II of CEN3 ( probe 8 ) . Ndc10p bound to this DNA fragment , but more weakly than full - length CEN3 ( probe 1 ) . Suspecting that diminished Ndc10p binding might reﬂect the shorter length of probe 8 relative to intact CEN , we generated a 184 - base pair probe ( probe 9 ) in which 88 base pairs of CDEIII were substituted with an equal length fragment of plasmid DNA while maintaining wild - type sequence for CDEI and CDEII . Ndc10p bound tightly to probe 9 ( complex formation was (cid:1) 75 % as efﬁcient as for probe 1 ) , leading us to conclude that DNA ﬂanking CDEII is involved in nonse - quence - speciﬁc Ndc10p binding . CDEII binding by Ndc10p is not a phenomenon limited to CEN3 because a similar binding pattern was obtained with probes ( probe 1 ) derived from four different centromeres ( Figure 1E ) . Thus , binding to CDEII by Ndc10p seems to be a conserved feature of yeast kinetochores . These ﬁndings with recombinant proteins indicate that Ndc10p is capable of existing independently of the other CBF3 components and that this Ndc10p is active in CDEII binding . To demonstrate that this situation exists within a cell , whole - cell protein extracts were prepared from wild - type yeast and subjected to hydrodynamic and bandshift analysis . Sizing columns and glycerol velocity gradients demonstrate that Ndc10p exists as a distinct species in yeast extract ( Figure 1F ) . When incubated with CDEII - containing DNA ( Probe 9 ) , these extracts gave rise to set of complexes whose electrophoretic mobilities were indistinguishable from those of puriﬁed recombinant Ndc10p ( our unpub - lished data ) . Combined with our analysis of recombinant proteins also showing that Ndc10p can exist both as a ho - modimer on its own and as part of CBF3 ( Russell et al . , 1999 ; our unpublished observations ) , we conclude that unbound Ndc10p exists as a dimer and Cep3p is part of a 185 - kDa complex containing two Cep3p , one Ctf13p and one Skp1p subunits . From these observations we conclude that Ndc10p dimers represent the primary CDEII - binding activity that can be detected in yeast extracts by using bandshift gels . Mapping Ndc10p Binding Sites in CDEII To delineate the Ndc10p binding site in CDEII , we con - structed a series of CEN3 variants by substituting progres - sively larger regions of CDEII with plasmid DNA while maintaining the wild - type sequence of CDEI and CDEIII and the spacing between them ( Figure 2 ) . When a substitu - tion series from the left ( starting at CDEI ; LE1 – 7 ) was exam - ined , Ndc10p - DNA binding decreased progressively ( Figure Figure 1 . Binding of CBF3 and Ndc10p to CDEII and CDEIII centromeric DNA . Nu - clear extracts from insect cells expressing recombinant proteins were incubated with radiolabeled DNA fragments and com - plexes resolved on nondenaturing Band - shift gels ( see MATERIALS AND METH - ODS ) .

( C ) Binding of recombinant CBF3 proteins to intact centro - meric DNA ( probe 1 ) and a plasmid control ( probe 7 ) . Ndc10p was puriﬁed from insect cell lysates by ion exchange chromatogra - phy and added at 0 . 4 pmol ( lanes 7 ) , 1 pmol ( lane 8 ) , or 2 pmol ( lane 9 – 10 ) . Binding of 2 pmol of puriﬁed Ndc10p to the indicated probes ( D ) and to 184 - base pair fragments of CEN2 , CEN3 , CEN4 , and CEN6 ( E ) that span CDEI - II - III ( probe 1 ) . ( F ) Analysis of whole - cell yeast extracts was performed us - ing a Sephacryl S - 500 HR column ( Amer - sham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) and glyc - erol velocity gradients as described previously ( Russell et al . , 1999 ) followed by immunoblotting with anti - Cep3p antibodies and anti - myc antibodies ( for Ndc10p - myc6 ) . The table shows estimated hydrodynamic properties ( see Russell et al . , 1999 for details ) . CDEII Binding by Ndc10p Vol . 14 , November 2003 4559 2A ) . When substitutions from the right ( starting at CDEIII ; RE1 – 7 ) were examined , the most dramatic effects occurred with mutations covering the ﬁrst 36 base pairs ( Figure 2B ; compare RE2 and RE3 ) . From experiments with a set of linker - scanning mutations ( S1 – 7 ) , the CDEII region (cid:1) 36 base pairs to the left of CDEIII seems to be the most critical for Ndc10p binding ( Figure 2C , S5 ) , but no single 12 - base pair mutation abolished binding completely . We conclude from these data that Ndc10p - CDEII binding interactions are dis - persed across the length of CDEII with particularly impor - tant contacts near the middle . We propose that Ndc10p makes extended DNA contacts and that multiple Ndc10p dimers participate in CDEII binding . The latter suggestion is consistent with the detection bandshift of more than one distinct Ndc10p – DNA complex in our experiments ( Figure 1C ) . We have previously come to similar conclusions about the capacity of Ndc10p to form higher order complexes on CDEIII , in association with CBF3 ( Espelin et al . , 1997 ) . Properties of Ndc10p Binding Sites Does CDEII contain a series of Ndc10p sites in tandem ? The region of CDEII most critical for Ndc10p association ( bases 49 – 60 of CDEII ; Figure 2C probe S5 ) does not represent a motif found elsewhere in CDEII . It therefore seems likely that Ndc10p binds to a family of related but nonidentical AT - rich sequences . To capture this sequence selectivity com - putationally , we used a supervised learning algorithm to derive a pattern that extracts the characteristic features of CDEII in all 16 S . cerevisiae centromeres . The yeast genome has an overall A (cid:3) T composition of 61 % but the distribution of A - T bases is nonrandom . When an 80 - base pair window ( the approximate length of CDEII ) is used to scan the ge - nome , more regions with very high or very low A (cid:3) T content are found than expected by chance ( (cid:1) 100 times more frequent ) . Moreover , for any particular A - T composi - tion , stretches of poly - adenine or poly - thymine are also more common than expected . The 16 CDEII sequences in S . cerevisiae are characterized both by high A - T content ( aver - aging 92 % ) , by the presence of 4 – 6 poly - A and poly - T stretches , and by a length of 78 – 84 base pairs . Are there sequences at locations in the genome other than centromeres that match the CDEII pattern ? When we scanned Chromosome III for matches to the CDEII pattern , 71 sites were found with a mean spacing of 4 . 5 kb ( a similar density was found elsewhere in the genome ; see MATERI - ALS AND METHODS ) . A scan for the CDEIII pattern yielded only the single centromere present on each chromo - some . Within the selected region of the Chromosome III arm shown in Figure 3 , four matches to the CDEII pattern are found ( including CEN3 ; Figure 3 , A and B ) . These sites are characterized both by high A - T content ( marked with blue squares ) and poly - A / poly - T stretches ( yellow squares ) . A highly AT - rich sequence is also present but it lacks poly - A and poly - T stretches ( Figure 3 ; fragment SGD 212531 ) . To determine whether Ndc10p can bind to these noncentro - meric sequences , we generated 25 successive 200 - base pair probes spanning the identiﬁed sequences and ﬂanking DNA and analyzed Ndc10p binding to the probes on nondenatur - ing gels . Ndc10p associated efﬁciently with the three CDEII - like arm sequences ( Figure 3 , lanes c , j , and o ) and to CEN3 - CDEII ( Figure 3 , lane t ) , but not to intervening DNA , a random genomic sequence ( Figure 3 lane w ) or to the control AT - rich site ( Figure 3 , lane x ) . In addition , the DNA – protein complexes formed on arm and CDEII sequences had similar electrophoretic mobilities and the two classes of sequence ( arms and CEN ) cross - competed with one another ( our un - published data ) . Thus , the CDEII pattern generated by com - puter learning captures the DNA features responsible for Figure 2 . Mapping the Ndc10p binding site in CDEII by substitution and linker scanning mutagenesis . The amount of binding of each 184 - base pair probe to 2 pmol puriﬁed Ndc10p is shown as a percentage of binding to a wild - type CEN3 control .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 4560 Ndc10p binding , even though the pattern does not corre - spond to a simple consensus . In summary , our results support the conclusion that Ndc10p binds in the absence of other CBF3 proteins , speciﬁcally to a subset of AT - rich , poly - A – , and poly - T – containing sequences similar to CDEII . The CDEII pattern is present considerably more often in the genome ( (cid:1) 1000 times more frequent ) than would be predicted by chance and Ndc10p binding sites may therefore be present along chromosome arms away from centromeres . Figure 3 . Binding of recombinant Ndc10p to sequences on Chromosome III arms and in CEN3 . ( A ) DNA probes in 200 - base pair increments were generated across the indicated regions in the KAR4 - PBN1 interval and analyzed for binding to puriﬁed recombinant Ndc10p . Distances are indicated in nucleotides from the left telomere of Chromosome III . The graph shows the product of the log probability of the A - T composition in successive 80 - base pair intervals and the log probability of the number of stretches containing four or more adenines or thymines in a row . To ﬁnd potential Ndc10p binding sites , sequences were sought in which the A - T composition exceeded 80 % ( blue boxes ) and the number of poly - A / poly - T stretches was signiﬁcantly above average for the genome ( yellow boxes ) . Ndc10p binding was predicted to occur on sequences in which both of these thresholds had been exceeded ( green regions ) . ( B ) Sequences of six 80 - base pair windows in Chromosome III analyzed for Ndc10p binding in vitro . Position refers to the number of the ﬁrst nucleotide in the window relative to the left telomere of Chromosome III ( Cherry et al . , 1997 ) and “A (cid:3) T” % to the percentage of adenine plus thymine . Stretches of A and T are emphasized in bold and underlined . Sequence 113800 is CDEII of CEN3 ; 175000 ( lane w ) represents a randomly chosen genomic location ; 212531 is a site of high A - T content but lacking poly - A / poly - T stretches . CDEII Binding by Ndc10p Vol . 14 , November 2003 4561 Increased Chromosome Loss Associated with Mutations in Ndc10p Binding Sites To begin to establish a biological function for the binding of Ndc10p to CDEII , we asked whether mutations that affect Ndc10p - CDEII binding in vitro also affect centromere func - tion in vivo . A subset of CEN3 constructs containing wild - type or mutant sequences in combination with the URA3 gene were recombined into Chromosome III in diploid cells , replacing the natural centromere on one chromosome with a modiﬁed sequence while maintaining the wild - type centro - meric sequence on the other chromosome ( Figure 4A ) . We then determined the percentage of URA (cid:3) cells by plating on SD - URA and YPD after 0 , 7 , and 13 generations of nonse - lective growth in YPD ( Figure 4B ) and determined the loss rate of the mutated chromosomes ( Figure 4C ) . The loss rate of wild - type centromeres was essentially zero after 13 gen - erations of nonselective growth ( Figure 4 , B and C ) . Alter - ation of bases “49 – 60” in the middle of CDEII , the mutation with the greatest reduction in Ndc10p binding in vitro , drastically decreased the mitotic stability of Chromosome III , resulting in a loss rate of 2 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 2 per generation ( Figure 4 , B and C ) . When CDEII was replaced in its entirety with plasmid ( Tet r ) DNA , mitotic chromosome segregation ﬁdel - ity was again severely compromised , with an estimated loss rate of 2 . 6 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 2 per generation observed ( Figure 4 , B and C ) . Centromere function in Chromosome III could be sub - stantially rescued , although not up to wild - type levels , by inserting a DNA sequence from an Ndc10p binding site from the Chromosome III arm , whereas an AT - rich sequence that lacks Ndc10p binding activity in vitro rescued CEN function much less efﬁciently ( our unpublished data ) . How - ever , these data must be interpreted with some caution . The presence of chromosomes with CDEII mutations causes a substantial increase in cell - cycle doubling time ( Figure 4C ) , apparently as a consequence of a mitotic delay that is Mad2 dependent . Moreover , starting cultures seem to be quite aneuploid , probably as a consequence of chromosome non - disjunction . Both of these problems are much more severe in our hands with CDEII mutations than with CDEIII muta - tions , and CDEII mutant chromosomes clearly warrant fur - ther investigation by live cell analysis ( He et al . , 2001 ) . Nev - ertheless , our data do show that CDEII sequences that bind Ndc10p in vitro are important for centromere function in vivo and that Ndc10p binding sites from chromosome arms can function at the centromere . We have therefore estab - lished a correlation between Ndc10p activity in vitro and CDEII function in vivo ( see DISCUSSION ) . Ndc10p Association with Chromosome Arms Does Ndc10p bind to chromosome arms in vivo as sug - gested by our in vitro data ? To investigate this question , we performed ChIP analysis on a region of Chromosome V that had previously been examined in detail for the binding of cohesins ( Tanaka et al . , 1999 ) . The cohesin proteins Mcd1 / Scc1p , Scc3p , Smc1p , and Smc3p ( Strunnikov et al . , 1993 ; Guacci et al . , 1997 ; Michaelis et al . , 1997 ; Skibbens et al . , 1999 ; Toth et al . , 1999 ) link sister chromatids together during meta - phase and associate preferentially with AT - rich DNA ( Blat and Kleckner , 1999 ; Megee et al . , 1999 ; Tanaka et al . , 1999 ) . It therefore seemed possible that the cohesins and Ndc10p might bind to the same arm sequences . When the Chromo - some V region was scanned for potential Ndc10p binding Figure 4 .

A wild - type strain lacking a tagged protein ( Un - tagged ) serves as negative control for the level of background cross - linking . Percentage of cross - linking ( relative to total input DNA ) of Ndc10p - myc6 and the wild - type ( Untagged ) to Chromosome V are graphed against the left axis ( vertical bars ) ; percentage of cross - linking of Mcd1p - myc18 is graphed against the right axis ( line ) ( separate axes were used because absolute ChIP values differed ) .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 4562 sites , several strong matches were identiﬁed . To examine the region for cohesin and Ndc10p binding in vivo by ChIP , yeast cells expressing either Mcd1p - myc18 or Ndc10p - myc6 in place of the wild - type proteins were cross - linked with formaldehyde , extracts prepared , DNA sheared to an aver - age length of 500 base pairs , and the myc - tagged proteins isolated by immunoprecipitation . Extract from cells lacking a myc - tagged protein ( untagged ) served as a negative con - trol . Cross - links were hydrolyzed and DNA sequences as - sociated with Ndc10p - myc6 and Mcd1p - myc18 were de - tected by PCR ( method of Megee et al . , 1999 ; Chromosome V oligos used by Tanaka et al . , 1999 ) . We observed that Ndc10p - myc6 cross - linked strongly to CEN5 DNA ( our un - published data ) , as expected , and to different extents to DNA along the Chromosome V arms ( Figure 4D ) . The peaks of cross - linking were signiﬁcantly above background levels observed with an untagged strain and corresponded to se - quences that were positive for Ndc10p binding in vitro ( Figure 4E ) . The Ndc10p cross - linking peaks did not corre - spond ( or alternate with ) peaks of Mcd1p binding , however , arguing against a connection between Ndc10p and cohesin ( Figure 4D ) . Furthermore , binding of Ndc10p to arm sites was at best three - to fourfold above the untagged control and 5 - to 10 - fold lower than the level of Ndc10p cross - linking to centromeres . We have repeated this experiment with many variations using synchronized and asynchronous cultures and in each case obtained similar results : Ndc10p - myc6 cross - links more strongly to some arm sites than oth - ers , cross - linking is well above background levels in un - tagged strains , but the absolute level of cross - linking is low . One explanation for the low but reproducible signal along arms is that the epitope tag used for Ndc10 immunoprecipi - tation is less accessible on arms than at centromeres . A second , more likely explanation , is low fractional occupancy of Ndc10p on arm sites . Consistent with this idea , the on - off rate of Ndc10p at CDEII in vitro is high ( seconds per minute as opposed to hours for CBF3 on CDEIII ; our unpublished data ) . In summary , ChIP data are consistent with noncen - tromeric binding by Ndc10p but short of conclusive . We therefore sought , using high - resolution imaging , to obtain independent conﬁrmation that Ndc10p is present at cellular locations other than centromeres . Asynchronous cultures of cells carrying Ndc10 - GFP were compared with cells in which known kinetochore proteins were similarly tagged . To determine the position of the spindle as well as verify cell cycle status , the spindle poles were marked with Spc42 - CFP and three - dimensional images were obtained from live and ﬁxed cells by using deconvolution micros - copy . In other work from this laboratory , high - resolution imaging has shown that kinetochore proteins localize during metaphase to two lobes on either side of the spindle mid - zone ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; He et al . , 2001 ) . These lobes correspond to the average positions of congressed sister kinetochores , and thus to the budding yeast meta - phase plate . The localization of one of these kinetochore - speciﬁc proteins , Mtw1p - GFP , is shown in Figure 5 , B and D ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; He et al . , 2001 ) . The apparent overlap of Mtw1p - GFP lobes and spindle poles is an artifact of projecting a three - dimensional distribution onto two di - mensions ( He et al . , 2000 ) . Some kinetochore proteins have a more complex distribution than Mtw1p , being localized not only to lobes of congressed kinetochores but also to nuclear microtubules , spindle pole bodies , and cytoplasmic struc - tures ( Bik1p , Stu2p , and Ipl1p ; He et al . , 2001 ; Tanaka et al . , 2002 ) . Among the localization patterns , we have observed for (cid:1) 25 kinetochore proteins examined thus far , Ndc10p is unique . Ndc10p is found both in a region of the nucleus consistent with congressed kinetochores and is also present along much of the chromatin ( Figure 5A ) . In early anaphase spindles , Ndc10p - GFP ﬂuorescence is visible in a broad distribution similar to that of DAPI - stained DNA ( Figure 5C ; colocalization of Ndc10p and DAPI has not been possible because of the much greater brightness of the DAPI - stained DNA , but the pattern of Ndc10p localization is very similar ) . Somewhat later in anaphase , Ndc10p is also visible along the interpole microtubules , a pattern that has been noticed by others ( our unpublished observations ; Zeng et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast , in control cells carrying only tagged spindle poles and imaged under identical conditions , neither chromatin nor microtubule ﬂuorescence are visible , conﬁrming that they are speciﬁc to Ndc10p - GFP ( our unpublished observa - tions ) . These data argue strongly that Ndc10p is present in Figure 5 . Localization of Ndc10 - GFP and Mtw1p - GFP in meta - phase and anaphase cells . Ndc10p and Mtw1p , a known kineto - chore protein ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ) , were tagged with GFP ( green ) and the spindle pole component Spc42p was tagged with CFP ( red ; indicated by yellow arrowheads ) . Maximum intensity projections of three - dimensional image stacks containing 10 to 20 0 . 2 - (cid:2) m sections are shown representing typical images . The outline of the cell is indicated in yellow . All cells were exposed similarly and images have been adjusted to give the most accurate compar - ison .

CDEII Binding by Ndc10p Vol . 14 , November 2003 4563 nuclei not only at centromeres but also at other structures that probably correspond to chromosome arms . DISCUSSION Homologies between kinetochore proteins in higher and lower eukaryotes argue for substantial evolutionary conser - vation in kinetochore architecture . Centromeric DNA is strikingly different among different species , however , con - sisting of as few as 125 - base pairs of speciﬁc DNA in bud - ding yeast and as many as several megabases in humans . One of the central mysteries in mitosis is the molecular basis of this radical divergence in centromere organization within the context of substantial conservation in kinetochore com - position . One way to clarify this mystery is to uncover the molecular principles of yeast centromere organization and to use these principles to study complex animal cell centro - meres . The least well understood of the three sequence elements in S . cerevisiae centromeres is CDEII . Cbf1p has been shown to bind CDEI ( Jiang and Philippsen , 1989 ; Cai and Davis , 1990 ; Mellor et al . , 1990 ) and CBF3 to bind CDEIII ( Lechner and Carbon , 1991 ; Espelin et al . , 1997 ) , but no CDEII - interacting proteins have been identiﬁed thus far . A key ﬁnding from a large number of studies is that the association of all known kinetochore proteins with centro - meric DNA depends on functional Ndc10p ( Ortiz et al . , 1999 ; He et al . , 2001 ; Janke et al . , 2001 ) . In this work , we propose that the critical role for Ndc10p is a consequence of its sequence - speciﬁc binding to both CDEII and CDEIII . DNA Binding Activities of Ndc10p Previous analysis of Ndc10p focused on its binding to CDEIII DNA as part of a CBF3 core complex containing a homodimer of Ndc10p , a homodimer of Cep3p , and a het - erodimer of Skp1p and Ctf13p . When assembled into CBF3 , Ndc10p , Ctf13p , and Cep3p are in direct contact with CDEIII DNA , as judged by DNA – protein cross - linking , but none of these proteins can bind CDEIII on its own ( Figure 6 ; Espelin et al . , 1997 ) . We now show that Ndc10p interacts with CDEII in the absence of other CBF3 proteins . This binding includes an extended series of sequence - speciﬁc contacts more than (cid:1) 80 base pairs of CDEII as well as sequence - independent contacts with ﬂanking DNA . In addition , three or more CDEII – Ndc10p complexes differing in electrophoretic mo - bility form in vitro ( depending on Ndc10p concentration ) , probably representing different numbers of Ndc10p dimers on each DNA molecule . It is further notable that the in vivo loss rate of chromosomes carrying a speciﬁc 12 base pair mutation in CDEII , which markedly reduces in vitro binding of Ndc10p , is similar to the loss rate observed by replacing Figure 6 . Speculative model for the interaction of Ndc10p , CBF3 , and nucleosomes with yeast centromeres . Three different modes of Ndc10p – DNA interaction are shown . The extended CBF3 complex on CDEIII involves sequence - speciﬁc binding by one Ndc10p dimer ( marked A ) and sequence - independent binding by a second dimer ( marked B ; Espelin et al . , 1997 ; Russell et al . , 1999 ) . We propose that multiple Ndc10p dimers bind sequence - selectively to CDEII ( marked C ) , with particularly important binding by one dimer ( C , solid outline ) to positions 49 – 60 of CDEII ( Figure 2 ) . The sites of cross - linking by CBF3 subunits to bases in CDEIII are indicated by arrows ( Espelin et al . , 1997 ) . This CBF3 – Ndc10p – CEN DNA complex is proposed to be ﬂanked by nuclease hypersensitive sites and embedded in a region of phased nucleosomes that contain the specialized H3 protein Cse4p ( Bloom and Carbon , 1982 ; Bloom et al . , 1983 ; Funk et al . , 1989 ) . No attempt has been made to speculate on the overall folding of centromeric chromatin , but it seems likely from studies in other organisms that it adopts a special structure . C . W . Espelin et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 4564 all of CDEII with plasmid DNA . This suggests that we have disrupted a key function of CDEII , which we believe is the ability to bind Ndc10p . Together , these data suggest that Ndc10p forms a multimeric structure and makes dispersed contacts throughout the length of CDEII . A similar type of binding by Ndc10p also occurs in CDEIII . Although there is only one Ndc10p dimer in the CBF3 core ( Russell et al . , 1999 ) , a second dimer associates with the core and ﬂanking DNA to generate an extended CBF3 complex ( Espelin et al . , 1997 ) . Our current model is that Ndc10p has multiple functions in kinetochore assembly involving three modes of DNA binding ( Figure 6 ) : sequence - selective binding to CDEII in the absence of other proteins ( this work ) , sequence - selective binding to CDEIII in the context of a CBF3 core complex ( Espelin et al . , 1997 ) , and sequence - independent but CBF3 - dependent binding to centromere - distal sequences in the context of the extended CBF3 complex ( Espelin et al . , 1997 ) . We have generated a large series of Ndc10p truncation and point mutations and tested them for binding to both CDEII and CDEIII but have found no separation - of - function muta - tions that retain one type of binding but eliminate another ( our unpublished data ) . We therefore believe that all three binding modes involve a single DNA binding domain , rather than multiple distinct domains . There are many pre - cedents for the binding of a protein to DNA in more than one context . Transcription factors such as activator protein - 1 can associate with a variety of other DNA - binding proteins on complex regulatory sites ( Shaulian and Karin , 2002 ) . The yeast transcription factors , Ste12p and Pho4p , can bind DNA as homomultimers and bind as cooperative complexes with other proteins ( Baur et al . , 1997 ; Magbanua et al . , 1997 ) . Consistent with binding in several modes , Ndc10p exist as a free dimer in whole - cell yeast extracts . Potential CDEII Binding Proteins Our data argue that Ndc10p binds to both CDEII and CDEIII DNA in vivo , but proteins other than Ndc10p have previ - ously been proposed to be CDEII interactors . These proteins include ubiquitous AT - binding proteins and the kineto - chore - speciﬁc proteins Mif2p , the yeast homolog of mam - malian CENP - C ( Meluh and Koshland , 1995 ; Meluh and Koshland , 1997 ) , and Cse4p , the yeast homolog of the vari - ant mammalian histone H3 CENP - A ( Pluta et al . , 1995 ; Stoler et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 1996 ; Meluh et al . , 1998 ) . Although it is possible , and even likely , that more than one kinetochore protein has CDEII - binding activity , it is informative to com - pare the candidates . A variety of ubiquitous proteins bind to A - T tracts , including DATIN ( Winter and Varshavsky , 1989 ) , CMBF ( Horn et al . , 1999 ) , and HMG - I ( Y ) ( Reeves and Nissen , 1993 ) , but none have been shown to have a speciﬁc role in kinetochore function . DATIN speciﬁcally has been shown to be incapable of CDEII binding in vitro ( Winter and Var - shavsky , 1989 ) . The discussion below therefore focuses on Ndc10p , Mif2p , and Cse4p . In considering the evidence discussed below it is important to note that none of these three proteins has been shown to be capable of binding to CDEII in vivo in the absence of a functional CDEIII se - quence . It therefore seems that the binding of all kinetochore proteins ( including the proposed CDEII - bound Ndc10p polymer ) requires that CBF3 be associated with CDEIII . Based on our current understanding of transcription , it seems likely that one important function of CDEIII is to disperse nucleosomes that might otherwise make centro - meric DNA inaccessible to other binding factors . We have obtained strong biochemical evidence that Ndc10p binds in a sequence - speciﬁc manner to CDEII in vitro but cannot yet determine the precise function of this binding in vivo . By comparison , the function of the CDEIII – CBF3 interaction has been ﬁrmly established by multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments . CDEIII is a relatively short and well - conserved sequence in which single point muta - tions abolish activity . When a range of point mutations can be made in a sequence and activities in vitro and in vivo correlated , a strong argument for the biological function of a particular DNA – protein interaction can be made . In the case of CDEII , however , the distributed nature of a site in which no single linker - scanning block mutation eliminates binding , makes it hard to draw as tight a link between biochemical and cellular activities . However , we have uncovered some of the key features of Ndc10p – CDEII association . CDEII muta - tions that impair Ndc10p binding in vitro impair centromere function in vivo . An algorithm that extracts the sequence features of CDEII identiﬁes noncentromeric DNA that is active in Ndc10p binding in vitro , and at least partially active in substituting for CDEII at centromeres in vivo . Additionally , we have attempted to use ChIP to map Ndc10p binding to CDEII and CDEIII in vivo and to evalu - ate the effects of CDEII mutations on Ndc10p - CEN associa - tion . However , the difﬁculty in resolving immediately adja - cent sequences by ChIP has made it impossible to distinguish between binding to CDEII and to CDEIII . Nev - ertheless , we conclude that a biological role for Ndc10p in CDEII binding is likely . The argument that Mif2p binds to CDEII is largely based on its homology to the mammalian centromere - binding protein CENP - C ( Meluh and Koshland , 1995 ) and the presence of an “AT - hook” motif proposed to assist in binding DNA ( Brown et al . , 1993 ) . However , the region responsible for DNA binding in CENP - C ( Politi et al . , 2002 ) is not conserved in Mif2p , and we have found that Mif2p lacking the AT - hook seems to be fully functional in vivo ( our unpublished data ) . We have also examined recombinant Mif2p in vitro , but have not detected binding to CEN DNA , either in the presence or absence of CBF3 . Furthermore , Mif2p has been shown to be incapable of binding CDEI (cid:3) II DNA in vivo as determined by ChIP ( Meluh and Koshland , 1997 ) . Thus , although it is clear that Mif2p is bound to centromeric DNA ( Meluh and Koshland , 1997 ) , the evidence is not strong that this in - volves a speciﬁc interaction with CDEII DNA as opposed to association with other kinetochore components . Cse4p , a specialized histone H3 , has also been proposed to be a CDEII - binding protein . This proposal is based on interpretation of ChIP results ( Meluh et al . , 1998 ) and the existence of genetic synergy between cis - acting mutations in CDEII and trans - acting mutations in CSE4 ( Smith et al . , 1996 ; Keith and Fitzgerald - Hayes , 2000 ) , but no direct interaction has been demonstrated . Given the small size of the yeast centromere and the proximity of CDEII and CDEIII relative to the resolution of ChIP ( (cid:1) 200 – 500 base pairs ) , it is difﬁcult , if not impossible to determine that Cse4p is binding CDEII using this method . Enhanced cross - linking of Cse4p to the center of CEN DNA ( Meluh et al . , 1998 ) would be likely if Cse4p - containing nucleo - somes ﬂank the centromere on both sides . Furthermore , Ortiz et al . ( 1999 ) have shown that Cse4p can be cross - linked by ChIP to a CEN3 fragment that includes CDEIII without CDEII , showing that CDEII is not necessary for Cse4p recruitment to centromeres . Classic experiments describing the nature of nucleosomes ( Kornberg and CDEII Binding by Ndc10p Vol . 14 , November 2003 4565 Klug , 1981 ) dictate that changes in the number of nucle - otide bases alter the phasing of DNA . Were core centro - meric DNA sequences wrapped around a nucleosome , changes in the length of CDEII would have a dramatic effect on the ability of kinetochore proteins to make spe - ciﬁc DNA contacts and would thus alter their orientation and interaction with other kinetochore proteins . Previous data demonstrate binding of the kinetochore proteins Cep3p , Ctf13p , Ndc10p , and Cbf1p ( Espelin et al . , 1997 ; Cai and Davis , 1990 ) to both sides of the DNA , making it a steric improbability that kinetochore proteins could bind on the face of the nucleosome and not be affected by the length of CDEII ( Bloom et al . , 1989 ; Meluh et al . , 1998 ; Cheeseman et al . , 2002 ) . Nucleosomes containing Cse4p should also be similar in their binding speciﬁcities to conventional nucleosomes because the Cse4p - speciﬁc se - quences , particularly the extended N terminus , project away from the DNA ( Luger et al . , 1997 ) . Conventional nucleosomes are known to bind poorly to sequences con - taining stretches of Adenine followed by stretches of Thy - mine ( Kunkel and Martinson 1981 ; Prunell 1982 ) . Al - though not excluded from nucleosomes , AT - rich DNA tends to be found at the ends of DNA wrapped around histones ( Satchwell et al . , 1986 ) , and CDEII would there - fore seem to be a poor nucleosome binding sequence . These considerations raise questions about the widely held assumption that Cse4p binds speciﬁcally to CDEII ( Keith and Fitzgerald - Hayes , 2000 ; Cheeseman et al . , 2002 ) . Instead , we put forward the hypothesis that CDEII is bound by a polymeric Ndc10p complex ; that phased nucleosomes reside on either side of the central CEN DNA - kinetochore structure , as originally suggested by Bloom and Carbon ( 1982 ) ; and that it is these nucleosomes that contain Cse4p . The evidence in favor of this model is by no means deﬁni - tive , but we believe it should be seriously considered as an alternative to the “nucleosome” - centric view . Noncentromeric Roles for Ndc10p Using the sixteen CDEII sequences in S . cerevisiae as a guide , we have identiﬁed sequences approximately every 5 kb along chromosome arms that match the CDEII pattern and are high - afﬁnity Ndc10p binding sites in vitro . The AT - rich , poly - A / poly - T pattern characteristic of these sites occurs 1000 - fold more frequently in the yeast genome than would be expected by chance , implying a possible biological func - tion . The Ndc10p – DNA complexes that form on arm sites are similar in electrophoretic mobility to complexes that form on CDEII , and arm sites cross - complete with CDEII for Ndc10p binding . Because the arm sites are not near CDEIII sequences , it is possible to probe the extent of Ndc10p bind - ing in vivo by using ChIP . Ndc10p is observed to cross - link to arm sites at levels well above background but below the levels observed at centromeres . The relatively low efﬁciency of cross - linking makes the result less than totally convincing but may reﬂect low occupancy of the sites in vivo . However , the localization of Ndc10p to structures other than kineto - chores has been conﬁrmed by three - dimensional deconvo - lution microscopy ( this study ) and by other methods ( Goh and Kilmartin , 1993 ; Zeng et al . , 1999 ) . The function of ex - tracentromeric Ndc10p is not yet known , but may reﬂect the assembly of structures that transiently associate with micro - tubules , perhaps to generate a yeast analog of polar ejection forces ( Rieder et al . , 1986 ) . Summary In summary , the data in this article support the conclusion that , in addition to binding to CDEIII as an essential com - ponent of CBF3 , Ndc10p also binds to CDEII and to sites along chromosome arms . We have not yet distinguished the functions of Ndc10p at CDEII and CDEIII , but it may not be meaningful to separate the kinetochore structure formed on CDEII from the assembly on CDEIII because proteins bound to each region of DNA likely interact . In fact , inversion of CDEIII , relative to CDEII , results in complete loss of centro - mere function ( Murphy et al . , 1991 ) . ChIP experiments dem - onstrate that kinetochore proteins do not associate in vivo with CDEI or CDEII in the absence of a proximal CDEIII sequence , not even Cbf1p , which recognizes a discrete site at CDEI in vitro ( Meluh and Koshland , 1995 ) . A more detailed knowledge of Ndc10p is required to resolve these issues , and we have therefore embarked on a high - resolution crys - tallographic analysis of Ndc10p complexes as well as elec - tron microscopy of CEN DNA with the CBF3 protein com - plex , Ndc10p - and Cse4p - containing nucleosomes . We nevertheless propose that kinetochores contain a polymeric Ndc10p assembly covering CDEII and CDEIII that forms a platform onto which the microtubule - binding components of kinetochores are recruited . The presence of an Ndc10p polymer may help to solve a compliance problem encoun - tered in ﬁrmly anchoring 13 microtubule protoﬁlaments to a single DNA sequence .
