Shauman University of Michigan University of California , Davis Numerous studies have found that female scientists publish at lower rates than male scientists . So far , explanations for this consistent pattern have failed to emerge , and sex differences in research productivity remain a puzzle . We report new empirical evidence based on a systematic and detailed analysis of data from four large , nationally representative , cross - sectional surveys of postsecondary faculty in 1969 , 1973 , 1988 , and 1993 . Our re - search yields two main findings . First , sex differences in research productiv - ity declined over the time period studied , with the female - to - male ratio in - creasing from about 60 percent in the late 1960s to 75 to 80 percent in the late 1980s and early 1990s . Second , most of the observed sex differences in research productivity can be attributed to sex differences in personal char - acteristics , structural positions , and marital status . These results suggest that sex differences in research productivity stem from sex differences in struc - tural locations and as such respond to the secular improvement of women ' s position in science . IN numerous studies have found that fe - male scientists publish at lower rates than male scientists , and research efforts to explain this gender gap have been largely unsuccessful ( Long and Fox 1995 ; Ward and Grant 1995 ; Zuckerman 1991 ) . In a classic statement of the problem , Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) characterize sex differ - ences in research productivity as " the pro - ductivity puzzle " : More than 50 studies covering various time pe - riods and fields of science report sex differ - ences in published productivity , more specifi - cally , that men publish more than women , even when age and other important social attributes are taken into account .

Two data sets used in this study ( Carnegie - 1969 and ACE - 1973 ) were obtained from the Inter - university Consortium for ferences in publication rates appear to have per - sisted for decades . So far , efforts to account for these differences have not been successful ; their existence continues to be a puzzle . ( P . 218 ) From their own research on scientists who received doctorates in 1969 - 1970 , Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) estimate that " women published slightly more than half ( 57 % ) as many papers as men " ( p . 217 ) . In a more re - cent literature review , Zuckerman ( 1991 ) maintains that " women publish fewer papers than men of the same ages , on average , 50 - 60 percent as many " ( p . 43 ) . So far , Cole and Zuckerman ' s provocative assertion has not been seriously challenged , and explanations for sex differences in re - search productivity have remained elusive .

For example , after reviewing many explanations in the litera - ture , Long ( 1992 ) states , " Unfortunately , none of these explanations has been very successful in accounting for sex differences in productivity . Indeed , Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) aptly label these sex differences ' the productivity puzzle " ' ( p . 160 ) . We report new empirical findings from a systematic and detailed analysis of data from four large , nationally representative surveys of postsecondary faculty in 1969 , 1973 , 1988 , and 1993 . We first examine changes in observed sex differences in research produc - tivity over the 24 - year period and then apply multivariate negative binomial models in an attempt to uncover explanations for the ob - served sex differences . MEASURING SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY To properly assess the extent of sex differ - ences in research productivity , we must first define the scientist population being studied and specify an appropriate measure for quan - tifying the sex gap in productivity . The Scientist Population Defining the scientist population is not a simple task ( Citro and Kalton 1989 ) . In prin - ciple , scientists can be defined according to one of three criteria ( Xie 1989 : 29 - 39 ) : ( 1 ) contribution to scientific knowledge ( contri - bution - based definition ) , ( 2 ) scientific edu - cation ( supply - based definition ) , and ( 3 ) sci - entific occupation ( demand - based defini - tion ) . In studies of sex differences in re - search productivity , a supply - based defini - tion is implicit in many studies that draw samples from recipients of doctoral degrees in science ( Clemente 1973 ; Cole and Zuckerman 1984 ; Long 1992 ; Reskin 1978 ) . The main competing definition is a demand - based one that restricts the population of sci - entists to those with academic jobs in scien - tific fields ( Blackburn , Behymer , and Hall 1978 ; Fox and Faver 1985 ) . Cole ' s ( 1979 ) study explicitly combines the two ap - proaches by defining scientists as recipients of science doctorates in 1957 - 1958 who were working in academia in 1965 . Each approach to defining scientists has advantages and disadvantages . The supply - based definition homogenizes the training credentials of scientists and theoretically per - mits the examination of sex differences in career trajectories ; but it could suffer from an " exposure bias " well understood by Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) : " If unequal propor - tions of men and women have remained in academia , the results . . . could be biased , since academics tend to publish more than government and industrial scientists " ( p . 223 ) . In contrast , the demand - based defini - tion homogenizes the job settings of scien - tists to those where publication of research results is expected and rewarded , but it fore - goes the potential analysis of sex differences in the processes of entry to and exit from academia . Hence , the supply - based and demand - based definitions have different implications for our problem : Do sex differences in re - search productivity result from women ' s lower likelihood of working in academia or from women ' s lower productivity within academia ? If the former explanation is true , the productivity puzzle should be defined more accurately as a career puzzle ( Bernard 1964 : 154 ) . This proposition is plausible given Cole and Zuckerman ' s ( 1984 ) finding , which is also confirmed by Long ( 1992 ) , that women are overrepresented among the ranks of unpublished scientists , many of whom may be " silent " because they are not em - ployed in academic settings . Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) , however , rule out differential representation in academia as a viable explanation for sex differences in research productivity by citing evidence that ' ' women . . . tend more often than men to be employed in academic jobs " ( p . 223 ) . In an earlier work ( Xie and Akin 1994 , fig . 1 ) , we showed evidence that contradicts this claim : For every scientific field , the percentage of women in a given cohort of doctoral recipi - ents is higher than the percentage of women among the doctoral recipients with regular faculty employment in postsecondary educa - tion . Thus , it is useful to restrict the popula - tion being studied to academic scientists , be - cause publication is generally expected , fa - cilitated , and rewarded for scientists em - ployed in academic settings . Following Cole ( 1979 ) , we propose to combine the supply - SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY 849 based and demand - based criteria and define scientists as individuals with doctoral de - grees who occupy faculty positions in sci - ence at academic institutions . This is a con - servative strategy , as it removes a significant source of heterogeneity ( job setting ) between the sexes . 1 Quantifying Sex Differences in Research Productivity Conceptually , productivity should be mea - sured as the amount of " research output " in a period of " exposure . " The concepts of out - put and exposure both require some discus - sion . Research output is commonly measured by the number of publications , either re - ported by respondents in surveys or found in bibliographic searches . In general , the publi - cation count is a crude measure of research output , as it does not distinguish between sole - authored and co - authored publications or between significant and insignificant pub - lications . Most survey instruments do not separate peer - reviewed journal articles and books from other forms of publications . 2 In addition , respondents to surveys may misre - port their publication counts because of re - call error or social desirability pressures . De - spite these problems , the count of publica - tions is commonly used because of its sim - plicity . This practice is supported for the study of gender differences in productivity by the lack of evidence linking sex to the aforementioned factors that make the mea - sure imprecise . For example , men and women scientists do not differ in their likeli - hood of collaboration ( Cole and Zuckerman 1984 ; Long 1992 ; Sonnert 1995 : 135 ) . Thus , measurement noise is commonly assumed , as it is in this study , to be innocuous with re - 1 This conservative strategy is sensible given the lack of large and informative longitudinal data sets on doctoral scientists . A comprehensive study examining both career dynamics and publi - cation histories would require data far richer ( in terms of sample size and contained information ) than that currently available . 2 For two of the data sets used in our study ( NSPF - 1988 and NSPF - 1993 ) , information about publication in different formats was collected . However , for consistency with the other two data sets and other comparable studies , we use the simple publication count as our output measure . spect to the main research focus ( i . e . , sex dif - ferences ) . Concerning exposure , an important dis - tinction must be made between " cumulative " measures and " short - term " measures . Cumu - lative measures refer to an individual ' s total research output over the complete span of his / her career ; short - term measures refer to research output accomplished during a rela - tively short interval . We contend that the use of short - term measures is preferred for stud - ies of sex differences in research productiv - ity . We cite three reasons for our position . First , women have only recently increased their participation in science and therefore have fewer years of experience than men on average . Hence , the use of cumulative mea - sures works against women in any cross - sec - tional data set . Second , it is highly plausible that women are more likely to temporarily withdraw from active research owing to spousal or childrearing constraints . This is particularly true in earlier decades ( Astin 1969 : 58 ) . Third , it is difficult to incorporate explanatory variables measuring resource availability into multivariate models when the cumulative count of productivity is the outcome variable , because such explanatory variables are more likely to be endogenous rather than exogenous to one ' s cumulative productivity . For example , prestige and type of employing institution , and academic rank may in fact result from productivity demon - strated at various points earlier in the career . If this is the case , the causality may run op - posite the direction assumed , or the explana - tory and dependent variables may be jointly determined . Although the problem of recip - rocal causality is not solved by the use of short - term measures , it is at least substan - tially mitigated . 3 For a majority of academic scientists , re - search productivity is a lifelong process with a distinct life - cycle profile : It sharply in - creases to a peak early in life and then gradu - ally declines ( Stephan and Levin 1992 ) . For 3 Even with a short - term measure of publica - tion rates , this research is not immune from the problem of reciprocal causality . We handle this problem in two ways : ( 1 ) through a series of hi - erarchical models moving from more exogenous controls to less exogenous controls , and ( 2 ) by interpreting our models as descriptive rather than as causal . 850 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW scientists at different points in their life cycles , we expect their short - term rates of productivity to be different . This problem highlights the need to control for experience . Indeed , several major studies ( Cole 1979 ; Cole and Zuckerman 1984 ; Long 1992 ; Reskin 1978 ) were designed to control for experience by following a single cohort of scientists who obtained their doctoral de - grees at roughly the same time . With cross - sectional data , it is necessary to statistically control for experience , and the effects of ex - perience can be interpreted as constituting a career profile under the assumption of sta - tionarity ( i . e . , no substantial changes across successive cohorts ) . Assuming that we have a good short - term measure of productivity , how should we quantify sex differences in research produc - tivity ? Earlier work ( Blackburn et al . 1978 ; Cole 1979 ) used the correlation coefficient . Typically , the researcher codes sex as a dummy variable and then computes the Pearson correlation coefficient ( r ) between sex and research productivity . The Pearson correlation involving a dummy variable for sex ( X ) and a continuous variable ( Y ) can be easily calculated from the sex - specific sample means of Y , the sex composition in the sample , and the standard deviation of Y . More specifically ( Stuart and Ord 1991 : 995 ) , r = _ ~ p ~ q ( f - g FO ) IS , , ( 1 ) where p and q denote the proportions of fe - male scientists and male scientists in the sample , and Y , and Y0 represent the mean publication counts for female scientists and male scientists , respectively . Equation 1 reveals that the correlation be - tween X and Y is not invariant with respect to the sex composition in the sample . It is evident that conditional means by sex con - vey the most essential information on sex differences . Let the simple ratio between sex - specific means be a measure of sex dif - ferences in research productivity : R = YYo * ( 2 ) Given its invariance in relation to the sex composition , R is preferable to r . Indeed , this is the measure used in the studies of the gen - der differences in publication productivity by Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) and Long a .

Illustration of Bivariate and Multivari - ate Models of the Relationship between Sex and Productivity ( 1992 ) . 4 Easy to compute and interpret , the ratio expressed by equation 2 has been the standard measure used in the labor force lit - erature studying sex differences in earnings ( Bianchi and Spain 1986 , chap . 6 ) . It also corresponds well with a key coefficient in the multivariate regression models that are presented below . MODELING SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY Why Multivariate Analysis ? It has long been recognized that sex differ - ences in productivity are confounded by sex differences in other factors that are related to productivity . This multivariate relationship can be easily demonstrated using the lan - guage of direct , indirect , and total effects in path analysis and structural equation models ( Alwin and Hauser 1975 ) . In Figure 1 we give an unrealistically simple presentation for illustrative purposes . The bivariate effect of sex ( female = 1 , male = 0 ) , shown as A * in Figure la , is called the total effect . In Fig - ure lb , this total effect of sex on research productivity is decomposed into two compo - 4 Long ' s ( 1992 ) measure , based on the same idea , has a different expression : ( Yo - Y ) / Yl ( i . e . , the male scientists ' relative advantage over female scientists ) . SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY 851 nents : a direct effect ( A ) and an indirect ef - fect through covariate Z ( paths C and B ) . 5 Note that sex ( X ) is causally prior to po - tential covariates ( Z ) so that Z represents all possible mediating variables between X and Y . In this simple setup , we are interested in the relative importance of the indirect effect of X on Y through Z . When the indirect effect constitutes a large part of the total effect of X on Y , we attain a good understanding of how the total effect of X on Y operates . In this context , we say that Z " explains " the ef - fect of X . Covariate Z mediates sex differ - ences in research productivity only if both of the following conditions are satisfied : Condition 1 : Z affects productivity in one di - rection . Condition 2 : Z is affected by sex in the op - posite direction ( with sex coded 1 for fe - males and 0 for males ) . In Figure lb , for example , Z has a positive effect on Y and is affected negatively by X . Covariates that have a negative effect on Y but are positively affected by X also would mediate the negative total effect of X on Y . Previous research on the productivity puzzle has considered many covariates , such as age , time between the bachelor ' s degree and Ph . D . , prestige of Ph . D . program , insti - tutional type , and rank ( Blackburn et al . 1978 ; Clemente 1973 ; Cole 1979 ; Fox 1981 ; Fox and Faver 1985 ; Reskin 1978 ; Sonnert 1995 ) . Despite these efforts , researchers have consistently been concerned with the inad - equacy of controls for structural factors that facilitate the production of scientific knowl - edge but are unequally distributed between men and women scientists . For example , Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 : 248 - 49 ) call for paying closer attention to structural determi - nants and specifically recommend studying the social organization of scientific laborato - ries and departments and the allocation of time for teaching versus research . In the re - port titled Climbing the Academic Ladder , the Committee on the Education and Em - ployment of Women in Science and Engi - neering ( 1979 ) criticizes the existing litera - ture for lacking adequate controls : 5 Because our models are not linear , the indi - rect effect cannot be computed as the simple product of the two direct effects C and B . For the specific case of science faculty , factors such as access to appropriate research facili - ties , division of time between undergraduate and graduate teaching responsibilities , and es - pecially availability of graduate and other re - search assistants may be of far greater signifi - cance to productivity than rank or other vari - ables which have been controlled in [ previous studies ] . ( P . 87 ) The report suggests , though it does not dem - onstrate , that sex differences in productivity found in earlier studies may result entirely from the omission of some important control variables . Since the publication of Climbing the Aca - demic Ladder , researchers have responded to these challenges by considering many con - trol factors , particularly the influence of co - authorship and family status . Neither of these control factors has been found to account for gender differences in publication productiv - ity because either condition 1 or condition 2 is not satisfied . In the case of co - authorship , condition 2 is not satisfied : Women are just as likely as men to co - author papers ( Cole and Zuckerman 1984 ; Long 1992 ) . In the case of marriage and motherhood , condition 1 is not true : " Women scientists who marry and have families publish as many papers per year , on the average , as single women " ( Cole and Zuckerman 1987 : 125 ) . To the extent that past efforts have not lo - cated explanatory variables that mediate be - tween sex and productivity , our confidence in the search for the mysterious other factors that will account for the gender gap in publi - cation productivity weakens . If we exhaust plausible explanations , the unexplained dif - ferences between the sexes in productivity can be legitimately called a " puzzle . " Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) lament that " observed disparities in productivity between the sexes have not been eliminated by taking into ac - count variables such as rank and institutional affiliation , although such disparities are re - duced when this has been done " ( p . 219 ) . This quotation reflects Cole and Zucker - man ' s skepticism that the control of observed variables measuring resources will explain the observed sex differences in research pro - ductivity . 6 6 Indeed , Cole ' s own latest attempt ( Cole and Singer 1991 ) focuses on the compounding pro - 852 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW We argue that Cole and Zuckerman ' s pes - simism is premature because Cole ' s ( 1979 : 68 ) and other researchers ' earlier recommen - dation has been only partially implemented . Thus , we set out here to incorporate into a single study of sex differences in publication output many of the individual and structural determinants suggested in the literature , in - cluding variables that capture the monetary aspect of scientific resources . In this way , we can clarify the debates , test competing hy - potheses , and illuminate the puzzling ques - tion of why women scientists publish less than men scientists . Causality Cole ( 1979 ) remarks , " Other variables such as differences in teaching responsibilities , access to research funds , and opportunity to collaborate with other outstanding scientists might account for the differences in pub - lished productivity of men and women " ( p . 68 ) . Cole ' s suggestion is tantamount to the statistical control of structural and resource variables in teasing out the net effect of sex on productivity . However , are structural and resource variables such as institutional affili - ation , rank , funding , and teaching hours nec - essarily causes of productivity ? The answer is no . For example , it is pos - sible that type of current institution , rank , re - search resources , and so on are consequences as well as causes of productivity . Clearly , the causality between research productivity and resource variables is reciprocal . Without ex - perimental data or at least longitudinal data , we cannot identify the reciprocal causality . However , we contend that it is still useful to control these variables in the recursive model depicted in Figure lb ( using available cross - sectional data ) and to interpret the results de - scriptively . Our main rationale is that the re - source variables are likely to be outcomes of cumulative productivity , whereas our mea - sure of research productivity is short - term . This distinction in timing gives us some le - verage for treating the resource variables as exogenous , because for most individuals the resource variables temporarily precede rather than succeed the current level of productiv - ity . Consider the example of research fund - ing . While it is reasonable to expect past pro - ductivity to affect the availability of funding , it seems much less likely that current produc - tivity has a large influence on the current availability of funding . Still , causal inference is difficult here because current productivity may merely be a proxy for earlier productiv - ity , where both are caused by some unob - served common factors . In other words , the stylized causal model depicted in Figure lb is likely to be misspecified because it omits some unob - served characteristics that affect both Z and Y ( i . e . , population heterogeneity ) . Examples of such unobserved characteristics include " ability " or " diligence , " which can underlie both past productivity and current productiv - ity . With longitudinal data , it is possible to partial out the unobserved heterogeneity un - der the assumption that these characteristics are fixed ( Allison and Long 1990 ) . With cross - sectional data , unobserved heterogene - ity is uncontrolled and may confound the causal relationship between the measured re - source variables and productivity . When this is the case , the resource variables are prox - ies for underlying causes and thus serve as " proximate determinants " of productivity . It is in this sense that we wish to draw descrip - tive , rather than causal , inferences from our multivariate model . Some support for tentatively treating the resource variables as exogenous is found in prior research showing the asymmetry of the reciprocal relationship between productivity and resource allocation . Despite the common wisdom that high productivity leads to ap - pointment at prestigious universities , empiri - cal evidence suggests a more complicated picture : Although higher productivity does not necessarily mean appointment at presti - gious institutions , movement to more presti - gious institutions enhances productivity ( Allison and Long 1987 , 1990 ; Long 1978 ; Long , Allison , and McGinnis 1979 ) . In other words , using the notation of Figure lb , the causal effect of Z ( institutional affiliation ) on Y ( productivity ) dominates the effect of Y on Z . Although similar asymmetric relationships may exist between productivity and other re - cess of small differences . Despite its elegance , Cole and Singer ' s theory of limited differences provides only a plausible hypothesis rather than an explanation for observed differences ( for a similar critique , see Reskin 1992 ) . SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY 853 source variables , we are not aware of empiri - cal evidence that supports this conjecture . The Model Our model for estimating the direct effect of sex in a multivariate framework is the fol - lowing loglinear model . For the ith scientist , log ( pi ) = log [ E ( yi xi , zi ) ] K = ( X + 3X + YikZik ( 3 ) k = 1 where M is the expectation of y ( research pro - ductivity ) conditional on x ( sex ) and z ( a vec - tor of covariates ) , and K is the total number of covariates controlled . We use the number of publications in the past two years as our measure of y . If we further assume that ji fol - lows an independent Poisson process for dif - ferent individuals conditional on x and z , equation 3 is a standard multivariate Poisson regression estimable via maximum likeli - hood ( Long 1997 , chap . 8 ; Maddala 1983 ; McCullagh and Nelder 1983 , chap . 6 ) . The loglinear model of equation 3 has cer - tain attractive properties . First , publication count in the last two years is naturally mod - eled as a Poisson process , which can be de - fined as the count of repeatable events within a fixed interval ( Allison and Long 1990 ; Long 1997 : 227 ; Maddala 1983 : 51 - 54 ) . Sec - ond , the Poisson model allows the variance of productivity to increase with the mean of productivity , thus handling a pattern of heteroscedasticity that is apparent in the data . 7 Third , there is no need to impute a small number for individuals with zero pub - lications as would be necessary for the least - squares estimation of equation 3 ( Long 1997 : 227 ) , because the Poisson model al - lows such occurrences . Last , the / 3 coeffi - cient for the sex dummy variable ( with fe - male = 1 , male = 0 ) can be conveniently in - terpreted as log ( R ) , where R is the ratio in productivity between women and men . This is true because , for two scientists with iden - tical values of z but of different sexes : / 3 = log ( PIx = 1 , z ) - log ( lIx = 0O z ) = log ( R ) . ( 4 ) Thus , we can compare estimated Rs in a mul - tivariate context to observed Rs in bivariate analysis . This greatly facilitates interpreta - tion of the multivariate results . One major drawback of the Poisson model as specified in equation 3 is that the Poisson assumption is highly restrictive . Because the mean equals the variance for a Poisson dis - tribution , equation 3 also restricts the vari - ance of productivity : log [ var ( ylx , z ) ] = a + fix + I YkZk . In the data used in our study , the variance of productivity far exceeds the mean of produc - tivity . This problem is called " over - dispersion . " Following the recommendation of McCullagh and Nelder ( 1983 : 198 - 200 ) and Long ( 1997 : 230 - 38 ) , we handle over - dispersion in our data by adding an addi - tional random component ei to equation 3 : log ( pi ) = log [ E ( yixi , zi , Ei ) ] K = C + # Xi + X YikZik + i * ( 5 ) k = 1 After further specifying the parametric as - sumption that exp ( Ei ) follows a Gamma dis - tribution with a mean of 1 and variance v , the model is then estimable via maximum likelihood , where 1 / v is known as the overdispersion parameter . 8 This model is commonly known as the negative binomial model . Our modeling strategy for each data set is to build a series of hierarchical models with the number of publications during the two years prior to the survey as the dependent variable . We first begin with the bivariate model with sex as the sole independent vari - able and gradually introduce other back - ground characteristics , structural locations and resources , and finally marital status . We attempt to maintain parallel models across the four data sets , although measurement of the covariates may differ slightly due to in - consistencies among the data sets . As vari - ables are added , the simpler model is nested within the more complicated model . With G2 and G2 denoting model chi - square sta - tistics respectively for the simpler model 7 In fact , this pattern of heteroscedasticity is also suggested by Long ' s ( 1992 : 166 , fig . 3 ) data . 8 As shown by Long ( 1997 : 233 ) , this modifica - tion leads to var ( y ) = M + M2 / v , with v > 0 . The larger lIv , the more severe the overdispersion . 854 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW and the more complicated model , the differ - ence , AG2 = G ' - G ' follows a chi - square distribution with de - grees of freedom equal to the number of ad - ditional parameters introduced in the more complicated model . Thus , we can use chi - square tests for pairs of nested models to as - sess the statistical significance of additional factors . At the same time , we are interested in how the net sex difference varies as rel - evant explanatory factors are controlled . Given the hypothesis that observed raw sex differences may result mainly from con - founding factors rather than from sex per se , we are interested in whether the magnitude of the sex coefficient shrinks toward zero as we gradually introduce more controls . DATA SOURCES We analyze data from four sources : the Na - tional Survey of Higher Education conducted by the Carnegie Commission in 1969 ( here - after Carnegie - 1969 ) , the Teaching Faculty in Academy study sponsored by the Ameri - can Council of Education in 1972 - 1973 ( hereafter ACE - 1973 ) , the 1987 - 1988 Na - tional Survey of Postsecondary Faculty con - ducted by the National Center for Education Statistics ( NCES ) ( hereafter NSPF - 1988 ) , and the 1992 - 1993 National Survey of Post - secondary Faculty also conducted by NCES ( hereafter NSPF - 1993 ) . The data sets are ideal for our purpose because of their na - tional representation of academic scientists across the complete spectrum of scientific specialties and their coverage of a variety of relevant explanatory factors . In addition , the four data sets are similar in sampling design and survey instrumentation , which allows us to replicate findings and to detect temporal changes over a span of 24 years . To make our results comparable to those from earlier re - search , we restrict the samples to doctoral scientists appointed as regular teaching fac - ulty at a postsecondary institution in one of the following major fields : biological sci - ence , engineering , mathematical science , physical science , and social science . We operationalize the definition of a regular teaching faculty appointment as one respon - sible for teaching at least one college - level course in an academic year . 9 Our opera - tionalization includes regularly employed lecturers / instructors but excludes graduate student instructors . The respondents in the four data sets were drawn by essentially the same two - stage sampling design . In the first stage , a large number ( more than 300 ) of postsecondary institutions were randomly selected with stratification based on institutional types from all two - year and four - year colleges and universities . In the second stage , faculty members employed at these selected institu - tions were randomly drawn . Information was collected by mail surveys only in Carnegie - 1969 and ACE - 1973 , while telephone inter - views were used for sampled individuals who failed to return mail surveys in NSPF - 1988 and NSPF - 1993 . The overall response rates were 60 percent for Carnegie - 1969 , 49 percent for ACE - 1973 , 76 percent for NSPF - 1988 , and 87 percent for NSPF - 1993 . Using our earlier definition of scientists and re - stricting our sample to those with valid re - sponses to relevant questions , we extracted information for 13 , 762 scientists from Carnegie - 1969 ; 9 , 504 scientists from ACE - 1973 ; 1 , 192 scientists from NSPF - 1988 ; and 3 , 007 scientists from NSPF - 1993 . The differ - ences in the number of cases across the four data sets reflect the large variation in the sample sizes of the four original studies . The dependent variable for our analysis is the count of all publications reported by the respondent scientist for the two years prior to the date of the survey . Included in the pub - lication count are articles published in refer - eed and nonrefereed journals , chapters in ed - ited volumes , books , and monographs . Un - like the other studies , the NSPF - 1988 survey instrument included " creative works " with articles and books in the publication count . This inclusion inflates the average publica - tion count for the NSPF - 1988 sample , al - 9 This operationalization suffers from the prob - lem of excluding permanent , doctoral - level , non - teaching researchers employed by universities . This exclusion is necessary for our study because the titles and statuses of such nonteaching re - searchers vary greatly across institutions . Insofar as our exclusion does not affect the relationship between sex and productivity ( i . e . , in the absence of three - way interaction ) , the exclusion does not bias our statistical results . SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY 855 though it should not bias our study if the relative importance of " creative works " is not related to sex . For both the Carnegie - 1969 and ACE - 1973 surveys , the publication count was measured in categorical intervals through a closed - ended question . For these data sets , we use the midpoint of response categories as an approximation of publica - tion counts . 10 The NSPF - 1988 and NSPF - 1993 data , in contrast , provided a detailed count of publications for each scientist . Is the scientist ' s self - reported number of publications a valid measure of productivity ? To our knowledge , the accuracy of self - re - ported publication counts has not been sys - tematically examined . This stands in contrast to productivity measures based on biblio - graphic sources , which Allison ' s ( 1980 ) study verifies to be highly reliable . Unfortu - nately , productivity measures based on bib - liographic databases are not available in our data sets . There are good reasons , however , to rely on the self - reported publication count as the dependent measure for this analysis . First , publication is a salient part of a scientist ' s work activities , and correct ac - counting of this information should be no less reliable than that for many other types of information ( such as job history , cohabi - tation history , and voting behavior ) com - monly collected in social surveys and widely used in sociological research . Furthermore , the mean level of productivity is roughly comparable ( around three to four publica - tions in two years ) across these surveys and between the surveys and other studies that rely on bibliographic searches ( Allison 1980 ; Allison and Long 1990 ; Cole and Zuckerman 1984 ; Long 1990 ; Stephan and Levin 1992 ) . This apparent comparability in means is no proof of the validity of the self - reported mea - sure , but nonetheless it is reassuring . Finally , although self - reported counts are likely to be contaminated by measurement error , it is not clear why the measurement error should be related to sex , our primary independent vari - able of interest . In fact , our bivariate result on sex differences in productivity from Carnegie - 1969 and ACE - 1973 closely repli - cates those from earlier studies . In sum , 10 The following coding scheme was used : none = 0 , ito 2 = 1 . 5 , 3 to 4 = 3 . 5 , 5 to 10 = 7 . 5 , more than 10 = 12 . 5 . while we acknowledge potential inaccuracies in the self - reported measure of publication count , we are reassured by its apparent con - sistency across multiple surveys and its con - gruity with studies based on bibliographic searches . Although the control variables we include in our analysis are not strictly parallel across the data sets , they are similar . We include a measure of the quality of employing institu - tion at the time of the survey for all four data sets . The institutional quality ratings in the Carnegie - 1969 data , based on the Gourman Report of 1967 ( Trow 1975 ) , were contained in the data file made available for public use . In the ACE - 1973 data file , institutions were rated according to the Carnegie Classifica - tion scheme ( shown in Appendix Table B ) . In NSPF - 1988 and NSPF - 1993 , institutions were rated according to a modified Carnegie Classification comparable to that used for the ACE - 1973 . Time between the undergraduate and the doctorate degrees is defined as the difference between the year of graduation with a B . S . or B . A . and the year the scientist received his or her Ph . D . We also include measures of research resources in the multi - variate analysis , as all of the surveys asked questions about research funding and access to research assistance . Information about the receipt of funding by five types of sources ( federal , state , private , industrial , and own institution ) is coded as dummy variables that are not mutually exclusive . The research as - sistance variable is coded as a single dummy indicating access to graduate research assis - tants . The other variables used in the analy - sis are self - explanatory . RESULTS Descriptive Results Table 1 presents summary statistics of two productivity measures , one cumulative and one short - term , by sex and data source . The cumulative measure is the total number of publications in a scientist ' s entire career ( de - noted T ) ; the short - term measure is a scientist ' s total number of publications in the two years prior to the survey date ( denoted Y ) . Severe overdispersion is apparent , as the standard deviations rather than the variances of T and Y are close to the means of T and Y . 856 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Table 1 .

As measured by both r and R , sex differences are greater for the cumulative counts of pub - lications than for the counts of publications in the last two years , which supports our ear - lier statement that the cumulative count is bi - ased against women scientists . According to the short - term measure of productivity ( Y ) , the gender gap in produc - tivity rate has appreciably narrowed over the 24 - year period . In 1969 , women ' s productiv - ity rate was only 63 percent that of men ' s . It increased to 68 percent in 1973 , and to 79 percent in 1988 . In 1993 , the sex ratio in pro - ductivity was 76 percent . While the Carnegie - 1969 data confirm Zuckerman ' s ( 1991 : 43 ) statement that women publish at " 50 - 60 percent " of men ' s rate , our results from the more recent surveys point to much smaller gender gaps . Instead of the " 50 - 60 percent " range in earlier times , data from NSPF - 1988 and NSPF - 1993 suggest that the female - to - male productivity ratio now hov - ers around 75 to 80 percent . 11 Our result is consistent with the observation of Bentley and Blackburn ( 1992 ) that " two - year publi - cation differences between men and women have narrowed considerably since 1969 " ( p . 702 ) . This finding represents a radical depar - ture from the historically persistent pattern observed by Cole ( 1979 : 242 ) and suggests that sex differences in productivity are not immune to social change . One of the most dramatic social changes in the United States since the 1960s is women ' s greater involvement and improved status in the labor force . As shown by Spain and Bianchi ( 1996 : 82 ) , among women of prime working ages ( 25 to 54 ) , women ' s la - " Testing for statistical significance of the changes in sex differences is tantamount to test - ing for the interaction effects between sex and period in a regression analysis with pooled data . For the baseline negative binomial model with - out other covariates , the chi - square statistic for the interaction is 11 . 34 for 3 degrees of freedom , and is significant at the p < . 01 level . SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY 857 bor force participation rate increased signifi - cantly from 42 . 9 percent in 1960 to 75 . 3 per - cent in 1994 . This greater involvement of women in the labor force has been accompa - nied by declines in occupational sex segre - gation and the gender gap in earnings ( Spain and Bianchi 1996 : 94 , 113 ) . In scientific aca - demia , the changes are equally dramatic ( Bentley and Blackburn 1992 ; Fox 1995 ) . We observe the trend toward equal represen - tation of women among science faculty in our own data . From the sex - specific sample sizes reported in Table 1 , it is easy to see that the percentage of women scientists increased from 5 percent in 1969 - 1973 to 15 percent in 1988 and 24 percent in 1993 . Along with increasing representation , the relative status of women science faculty also improved during the study period ( Bentley and Blackburn 1992 ) . This pattern is evident in the descriptive statistics presented in Ap - pendix Tables A through D . Consistent with earlier findings ( Fox 1995 : 212 ; Long and Fox 1995 ; Rosenfeld 1991 ) , our data indicate that women scientists are more concentrated in teaching colleges and are less likely to be found in research universities than their male counterparts . 12 For the Carnegie - 1969 data , for example , women are about twice as likely as men to be employed in four - year colleges ( 17 , 12 , and 9 percent for women , compared to 9 , 6 , and 3 percent for men , in high - , me - dium - , and low - quality four - year colleges , re - spectively ) . In contrast , only 20 percent of women , compared to 25 percent of men , are employed in high - quality universities . While this pattern of sex differences in institutional affiliation persists throughout the study pe - riod , the trend appears to be toward conver - gence . Let us measure the extent of sex seg - regation by institution type using the index of dissimilarity , which represents the mini - mum proportion of scientists who would have to change institution type in order to achieve equity between men and women . The indices of dissimilarity for the four different surveys point to a sharp decline between the early 1970s and the late 1980s : . 201 for Carnegie - 1969 , . 212 for ACE - 1973 , . 073 for NSPF - 1988 , and . 068 for NSPF - 1993 . It is also clear from our data that sex dif - ferences in teaching load have substantially narrowed over the period . With roughly the same five - category classification of teaching hours , the index of dissimilarity between the sexes is . 152 for Carnegie - 1969 , . 141 for ACE - 1973 , . 042 for NSPF - 1988 , and . 033 for NSPF - 1993 , respectively . 13 This suggests that the average teaching loads of male and female scientists have become more equi - table . Similarly , sex differences in research funding appear to have decreased . The fe - male - to - male ratio of funding from federal sources , for example , is . 610 in Carnegie - 1969 , . 653 in ACE - 1973 , . 770 in NSPF - 1988 , and . 784 in NSPF - 1993 . Multivariate Results The main findings from our multivariate analysis are summarized in Table 2 . Parallel results are presented from each data set . Four model specifications are presented in hierar - chical order for each data set , with a lower - numbered specification nested within a higher - numbered specification . Definitions and descriptive statistics of the covariate variables used in the multivariate analysis are presented in Appendix Tables A through D . The simplest specification is Model 1 , which includes only the effect of sex . The exponential function of the estimated coeffi - cient for sex ( i . e . , exp [ / Bse3 ] ) yields the ob - served female - to - male ratio of mean produc - tivity ( R ) . Model 2 adds controls for the fol - lowing individual background variables : field , time lag between bachelor and doctoral degrees , and years of experience beyond the doctoral degree . The introduction of these control variables significantly improves the explanatory power of the model . In the Carnegie - 1969 data set , for example , the change in G2 is 1 , 183 for 11 degrees free - dom . Improvement in the goodness - of - fit of Model 2 over Model 1 is smaller but highly 12 Although Zuckerman ( 1991 : 35 - 36 ) main - tains that women are no less likely to be located in prestigious research institutions than men , Long and Fox ( 1995 : 51 ) clearly reject Zucker - man ' s claim . 13 Because of limitations in the original forn of the ACE - 1973 data , teaching hours are cod with one less category than the coding for t other three surveys . This coding difference cot produce a conservative bias , as fewer category usually lead to smaller indexes of dissimilarity 858 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Table 2 .

The significant improvement in good - ness - of - fit is also indicated by much higher values of pseudo - R2 in Model 2 than in Model 1 , with pseudo - R2 defined as 1 - exp ( G2 / N ) , where N denotes the sample size ( Long 1997 : 105 ) . In Model 3 , we add the variables measur - ing type of current institution , academic rank , teaching hours , research funding , and research assistance . While the background variables included in Model 2 are clearly ex - ogenous to the dependent variable measuring productivity , the resource variables intro - duced in Model 3 are potentially contami - nated by reciprocal causality with respect to productivity . Again , we observe that the covariates strongly affect the two - year pub - SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY 859 lication count , with a significant improve - ment in goodness - of - fit over Model 2 . In Carnegie - 1969 , the change in G2 between Models 3 and 2 is 3 , 334 for 19 degrees of freedom ; the change is , respectively , 2 , 426 , 424 , and 881 in ACE - 1973 , NSPF - 1988 and NSPF - 1993 , all with 20 degrees of freedom . The increase in pseudo - R2 from Model 2 to Model 3 is similarly impressive . Finally , we include a dummy variable denoting a scientist ' s marital status in Model 4 . 14 By the AG2 criterion , marital status is a significant predictor for two of the four data sets , with the exceptions being NSPF - 1988 and NSPF - 1993 . All parameter estimates and their as - ymptotic standard errors for the final model are reported in the last two columns of Ap - pendix Tables A through D . For all four data sets , the introduction of the control variables significantly reduces the net sex difference in productivity . Al - though these control variables are rather crude , their unequal distribution by sex helps explain the estimated gender gap in produc - tivity . For the first two data sets , the coeffi - cient for sex drops precipitously with the in - clusion of these controls : for Carnegie - 1969 , from - . 456 in Model 1 to - . 379 in Model 2 and - . 095 in Model 3 ; for ACE - 1973 , from - . 393 in Model 1 to - . 293 in Model 2 and - . 044 in Model 3 . In the case of ACE - 1973 , the coefficient for sex is no longer signifi - cantly different from zero at the a = . 05 level in Model 3 . For NSPF - 1988 , the coefficient for sex is reduced to a statistically nonsig - nificant - . 094 in Model 2 . 15 For NSPF - 1993 , the sex coefficient decreases from - . 276 in Model 1 to - . 171 in Model 2 and - . 096 in Model 3 . Between the two earlier surveys and the two later surveys , there is a notable decrease in the power of the resource variables intro - duced in Model 3 to explain sex differences 14 NSPF - 1988 and NSPF - 1993 did not collect information on parenthood status . When we added a dummy variable measuring the presence of children to the full model for the other two data sets , it was significantly different from zero but unexpectedly positive only for the Carnegie - 1969 data . We found no interaction effect on research productivity of presence of children x sex . 15 Of course , part of the reason for the nonsig - nificance is the relatively small sample size for NSPF - 1988 . in productivity . The reason for this trend is not a decline in the importance of these re - source variables for determining productiv - ity , for there is evidence that their impor - tance has increased over time ( Bentley and Blackburn 1992 ) . 16 Rather , this trend is a re - sult of the fact that these resources have be - come more equally distributed between men and women . That is , in the language of our stylized causal model ( Figure lb ) , path C has weakened over time . Model 4 includes marital status as an ex - planatory variable . Although previous re - search has found childbearing to negatively affect productivity for both men and women scientists ( Hargens , McCann , and Reskin 1978 ) , there is reason to hypothesize that marriage is a personal asset . A scientist ' s work may benefit from marriage because of the additional economic resources and emo - tional support contributed by a spouse . In addition , a spouse also may provide domestic help that may free up time for the scientist ' s research . For three of the data sets ( Carnegie - 1969 , ACE - 1973 , and NSPF - 1993 ) , we found married scientists to have significantly higher ( about 7 to 11 percent higher ) rates of pro - ductivity than unmarried scientists , control - ling for other factors included in the model . Given that women scientists are less likely than men scientists to be married ( Marwell , Rosenfeld , and Spilerman 1979 ; Shauman and Xie 1996 ) , women scientists , on average , are less likely to benefit from marriage . Thus , controlling for marital status reduces the es - timated sex difference in publication produc - tivity . Indeed , the coefficient for sex is not significantly different from zero in Model 4 for all four data sets . Given the prevalence of within - family gender inequality ( Hochschild 1989 ) , it seems probable that men scientists benefit more from marriage than women scientists . To test this hypothesis , we add an interaction effect between marriage and sex to Model 4 . 17 To our surprise , this interaction is not 16 In our data , for example , the productivity penalty paid for a heavy teaching load ( 11 or more hours per week ) has increased from about 20 percent in 1969 - 1971 to 30 to 40 percent in 1988 - 1993 . Similar results hold for other resource variables . 17 The effect of the rank x sex interaction on productivity will be reported later . Although we 860 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW statistically significant ( AG2 = . 01 , . 03 , 2 . 44 , and . 45 respectively for the four data sets , all with 1 degree of freedom ) . That is , we find that men and women scientists benefit equally from marriage . One possible inter - pretation of this finding is that although women scientists may not gain relief from the domestic demands of marriage , they ben - efit from the high human capital of their spouses , who tend to be highly educated pro - fessionals ( Marwell et al . 1979 ; Shauman and Xie 1996 ) . Parameter estimates for the last model are presented in Appendix Tables A through D . Inspection of the results reveals that the es - timated effects for all the remaining co - variates included in the multivariate analy - sis are in the expected direction . Because our main focus is on sex differences in re - search productivity , we make only two brief observations based on other regression coef - ficients from the final model . First , the esti - mated pattern of experience agrees with Levin and Stephan ' s ( 1991 ; Stephan and Levin 1992 ) finding that scientists ' produc - tivity peaks early in their careers and then decreases with experience . Second , time be - tween a bachelor ' s degree and the Ph . D . has a negative effect on productivity . For ex - ample , those who took more than 10 years between their bachelor ' s degree and Ph . D . are 30 to 40 percent less productive than those who completed their Ph . D . within 4 years . Because women are 40 to 80 percent more likely than men to take 11 or more years between a bachelor ' s degree and a Ph . D . , the negative effect of time to Ph . D . contributes to women scientists ' lower rates of productivity relative to men ' s . Decomposition of Explanatory Power As shown in equation 4 , the ratio measure ( R ) of sex differences in productivity can be obtained from multivariate models as exp ( Psex ) . Thus , the difference in fsex be - tween a particular model and the baseline also tested other interactions , none was signifi - cant except for teaching hours x sex for the NSPF - 1993 data ( Z2 = 21 . 28 for 4 degrees of freedom ) . The direction of the interaction effect favors women at long teaching hours . Interested readers may request computer output from the authors . model ( Model 1 ) yields a sensible measure of the extent to which explanatory variables included in a model " explain " the raw bivari - ate sex difference . While this method gauges the explanatory power of a model , it cannot decompose the explanatory power to the in - dividual factors that are included in the . model . The reason for this is that the ex - planatory factors are correlated with each other . How much the coefficient of sex ( sex ) is changed by the inclusion of a particular factor depends on what other variables are included in the model . The models presented in Table 2 form a particular series of hierarchical models so that a higher - numbered model necessarily in - cludes the variables present in a lower - num - bered model . While this is an effective way to examine the additional explanatory power of the variables being added in a higher - num - bered model and their influence on the sex coefficient , this strategy does not allow the decomposition of the explanatory power of individual factors . That is , we know the col - lective explanatory power of the control vari - ables included in Model 3 and Model 4 in explaining sex differences in productivity , but we do not know their relative impor - tance . It is desirable to decompose the total explanatory power to components uniquely due to the different factors . While it is not possible to establish the " pure " explanatory power of the individual factors , it is illustrative to demonstrate how the inclusion or exclusion of an individual factor affects the sex coefficient ( lsex ) under certain conditions . We focus on the changes in sex under two starkly different situations and use the changes to measure the explana - tory power of the individual factor . The first measure of explanatory power is based on the decrease in sex after an explanatory fac - tor is taken out of the full model ( Model 4 ) . Define D1 as ( omitting the subscript for sex ) : D1 = exp ( f34 ) - exp ( l4 - k ) , ( 6 ) where f4 denotes the sex coefficient for Model 4 , and p4 - k denotes the sex coefficient for the model in which the kth factor is ex - cluded from Model 4 . If a particular factor contributes additional explanatory power in the presence of all other variables , we expect D1 to be greater than 0 . A negative D1 means SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY 861 Table 3 .

Two methods are used . The first method , labeled " low " ( DI ) , is based on the decrease in the coefficient of sex after an explanatory factor is taken out of the full model ( Model 4 of Table 2 ) . The second method , labeled " high " ( D2 ) , is based on the increase in the coefficient of sex after an explanatory factor is added to the baseline model ( Model 1 of Table 2 ) . In general , the " low " method tends to be too conservative whereas the " high " method tends to be too liberal . The last row , defined as the difference in the sex coeffi - cient between the full model and the baseline model , gives the upper limit of the explanatory power . All calculations ignore sampling error . that a particular factor does not appear to ex - plain the sex difference in the presence of other control variables . If the explanatory power of Model 4 were entirely due to this factor , l4 - k would be the same as / 31 , the sex coefficient for the bivariate model ( Model 1 ) , and D1 would be [ exp ( fl4 ) - exp ( fl1 ) ] . Our second measure is based on the in - crease in sex after an explanatory factor is added to the bivariate baseline model ( again omitting the subscript for sex ) : D2 = exp ( 31 + k ) - exp ( flI ) . ( 7 ) In our data , , 1 + k is estimated to be greater than / 31 but less than P4 . This means that D2 varies between zero and [ exp ( 134 ) - exp ( P I ) ] , with zero meaning no explanatory power and [ exp ( / 34 ) - exp ( / 3I ) ] being the maximum ex - planatory power . Hence , for a well - behaved explanatory factor k , both D1and D2 should vary some - where between 0 and [ exp ( / 34 ) - exp ( / 3 ' ) ] . In general , the D1 measure tends to be conser - vative whereas the D2 measure tends to be liberal . For this reason , we also call D1 the " low " method , and D2 the " high " method . The results are presented in Table 3 . All en - tries in this table ignore sampling error . Several findings emerge from an examina - tion of Table 3 . First , the range between the low and the high estimates is fairly large for most of the explanatory factors . In fact , the low estimates of several explanatory factors are negative . Again , this reflects the joint ex - planatory power among different factors and makes the task of decomposing explanatory power difficult . Second , the high estimates of institution type and research funding are consistently large across the surveys ( around 7 to 13 percent ) . In contrast , the high esti - mates of field , experience , rank , teaching hours , and research assistance are moderate ( less than 6 percent ) , with the exception of rank in 1988 and research assistance in 1969 . This suggests the potentially central role played by institution type and research fund - ing in generating sex differences in produc - tivity . Third , although moderate in size , the low estimates for time to Ph . D . and marital status are consistently positive across the surveys .

Net Sex Differences in Productivity by Academic Rank pendent explanatory power of personal at - tributes in explaining sex differences in pro - ductivity beyond measures of resources con - ducive to research . Selectivity Issue A clear finding of our analysis is that net sex differences in productivity are small once other personal characteristics , structural set - tings , and facilitating resources are taken into account . As mentioned earlier , however , interpretation of this result is less clear . The covariates we use may be the effects , rather than the causes , of research productivity , or they may be jointly determined by other un - observed variables such as motivation and ability . For example , men scientists may score favorably on variables measuring structural locations and resources conducive to research because such structural locations and resources are rewards for high produc - tivity . For example , consider academic rank , which is highly dependent on productivity ( Long et al . 1993 ) . As can be calculated from Appendix Tables A through D , full pro - fessors are about 20 to 40 percent more pro - ductive than associate professors , and asso - ciate professors are in turn 10 to 20 percent more productive than assistant professors . From the first two columns of the Appendix tables , we observe that women scientists are more likely to be found at lower ranks than men ( also see Ahern and Scott 1981 : 34 - 39 ) . Because promotion depends on productiv - ity , promotion is always selective . Unproduc - tive scientists are either kept at the entry ( or a relatively low ) rank or encouraged to leave academia . With productivity as an important criterion for promotion , women scientists should be promoted more slowly if they in - deed publish less than men . According to this reasoning , we then would expect sex differ - ences in productivity to be smaller at high ranks than at lower ranks . Lacking the nec - essary longitudinal information , we cannot depict the career trajectory of sex differences in productivity as is done by Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) and Long ( 1992 ) . 18 How - ever , we can gain some insights into the ca - reer pattern of sex differences in productiv - ity by examining the interaction effects be - tween sex and rank . For only two of the four data sets , the interaction proves to be signifi - cant : AG2 is 22 . 67 for the ACE - 1973 data and 9 . 10 for the NSPF - 1988 data , with 3 de - grees of freedom . For the Carnegie - 1969 data and the NSPF - 1993 data , AG2 is mar - ginally nonsignificant at 5 . 99 and 6 . 47 re - spectively , also with 3 degrees of freedom . 18 At first glance , it seems that we can retro - spectively trace the trajectory from the scientist ' s year of Ph . D . degree . However , this would not be correct , as only " survivors " from any given Ph . D . cohort are retained in our samples . In short , we are faced with the selectivity problem discussed earlier . SEX DIFFERENCES IN RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY 863 In Figure 2 , we present the estimated varia - tion ( ignoring sampling error ) in terms of fe - male - to - male ratios , from ACE - 1973 and NSPF - 1988 . From this figure it is easy to see the following pattern : Sex disparity in pro - ductivity narrows or even reverses as rank rises . Note that the " other " rank refers to lec - turers and instructors , a temporary status lower in rank than that of assistant professor . Because the " other " category is numerically small and operationally amorphous , it is not too surprising that the estimated sex differ - ences for this category are not stable across the four data sources . The pattern revealed in Figure 2 supports the notion that selectivity in promotion is at work : Women scientists ' disadvantage disap - pears or reverses at high ranks . This seems to contradict Cole and Zuckerman ' s ( 1984 ) and Long ' s ( 1992 ) finding that sex differ - ences in productivity generally increase for a given cohort , at least over the first nine ca - reer years . This apparent contradiction can be explained by the fact that scientists in our study are by definition academic scientists . If selectivity works to keep more women sci - entists than men out of high academic ranks , the observed disparity in productivity be - tween men and women scientists should nar - row rather than widen . If one follows a co - hort of scientists , as Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) and Long ( 1992 ) do , however , the se - lectivity could also mean that the average publication rate for women falls further with time , with an increasingly larger proportion of women dropping out of academia . Although selectivity seems to be at work , it appears to be of relatively minor impor - tance . We can support this claim by compar - ing sex differences in productivity depicted in Figure 2 at the three ranks of professor - ship . If the estimated net sex difference in productivity at the associate and full profes - sor ranks are contaminated by selectivity , there is reason to suspect that the estimate at the assistant professor rank is relatively free from such a problem , for assistant professor - ship is an entry - level title of an academic ca - reer . Here again , the estimated net sex dif - ference is small , with R being . 925 from the ACE - 1973 data and 1 . 032 from the NSPF - 1988 data . We thus conclude that selectivity may weaken , but does not qualitatively alter , our results . CONCLUSION Have we solved " the productivity puzzle " ? The answer is both yes and no . The answer is yes in the sense that we have , for the first time , successfully identified differences be - tween men and women scientists in personal characteristics , structural positions , and fa - cilitating resources that account for women ' s lower research productivity . That is , we have found that women scientists publish fewer papers than men because women are less likely than men to have the personal charac - teristics , structural positions , and facilitating resources that are conducive to publication . There is very little direct effect of sex on re - search productivity . However , we still do not know why men and women scientists differ systematically in these important dimen - sions , and in this sense the puzzle remains unsolved . As a friendly ASR reviewer points out , this research replaces " the old puzzle of productivity differences with a new puzzle involving differences in personal and struc - tural characteristics . " In fact , this " new " puzzle is closely related to a long - standing interest in differences in career trajectories between men and women scientists ( Bernard 1964 ; Rossi 1972 ; Zuckerman 1991 ) . Another important finding of this research is that overall sex differences in research productivity among academic scientists have declined in the recent years . With the num - ber of publications in the last two years as the measure of productivity , we find that the female - to - male ratio in productivity in - creased from 60 to 65 percent in 1969 and 1973 to 75 to 80 percent in 1988 and 1993 . A major reason for this trend is that the distri - bution of resources and structural positions , albeit still unfavorable to women , has be - come more equitable over the observed time period . The empirical evidence presented in our analysis is significant in its own right , even if theoretical interpretations of it may remain inconclusive for the time being . Some of the debates in the literature are of an empirical nature and can be settled with better data or better data analysis . Our results suggest that the notion of sex differences in research pro - ductivity as " the productivity puzzle " may be misleading for three reasons . First , when properly defined and operationalized , the 864 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW magnitude of raw sex differences in research productivity is smaller than previously claimed . 19 Second , to the extent that sex dif - ferences can be explained by personal char - acteristics , employment positions , and access to resources , sex differences in research pro - ductivity have structural causes that can be further investigated . Calling it a puzzle , therefore , mystifies an observed pattern . Fi - nally , as a manifestation of deeper social pro - cesses , sex differences in research productiv - ity have declined in response to the secular improvement of women ' s role in science , while the notion of a puzzle suggests an in - herently static and persistent nature of the phenomenon . Taken as a whole , the available evidence points out that men and women scientists of - ten pursue somewhat different career tracks . It has long been recognized that values and career ambitions differ between the sexes ( Bernard 1964 ; Davis 1964 , 1965 ; Turner 1964 ) . Much of the source of this difference is sex - typed socialization ( Marini and Brinton 1984 ) . However , a nontrivial part of the difference can also be traced to women ' s extra family responsibility associated with childbearing ( Shauman and Xie 1996 ) . In this study , we reaffirm the importance of structural sources of gender inequality in sci - ence : Women and men scientists are located in different academic structures with differ - ential access to valuable resources . Our study confirms the pattern found in other studies ( Fox 1995 ; Zuckerman 1991 ) - that men generally have positions superior to those of women , although structural differences by gender have appreciably declined over time . Once sex differences in such positions and resources are taken into account , as in this study , net differences between men and women in research productivity are nil or negligible .

Blackburn et al . ( 1978 ) , Fox and Faver ( 1985 ) , and Reskin ( 1978 ) all report smaller sex differences than the generalization of Cole and Zuckerman ( 1984 ) that women publish at 50 to 60 percent of the rate of men .
