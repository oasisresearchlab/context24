Here we develop a tech - nique for intracellularly calibrated superresolution microscopy that can measure the size of individual organelles as well as accurately count absolute numbers of molecules , by correcting for under - counting owing to immature ﬂ uorescent proteins and overcount - ing owing to ﬂ uorophore blinking . Using this technique , we characterized the size of individual vesicles in the yeast endocytic pathway and the number of accessible phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate binding sites they contain . This analysis reveals a char - acteristic vesicle maturation trajectory of composition and size with both stochastic and regulated components . The trajectory displays some cell - to - cell variability , with smaller variation between organ - elles within the same cell . This approach also reveals mechanistic information on the order of events in this trajectory : Colocalization analysis with known markers of different vesicle maturation stages shows that phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate production precedes fusion into larger endosomes . This single - organelle analysis can potentially be applied to a range of small organelles to shed light on their precise composition / structure relationships , the dynamics of their regulation , and the noise in these processes . phosphoinositides | GTPases | endocytosis | PALM | single - molecule S ingle - cell analysis of protein abundance has revealed cell - to - cell variation in the form of phenotypic ( extrinsic ) hetero - geneity and intrinsic variation ( 1 ) . Dynamic processes such as the cell cycle , endocytosis , and meiosis are regulated but also in ﬂ u - enced by stochastic events involving small numbers of molecules ( e . g . , DNA transcription ) ( 2 , 3 ) . Similarly , the size and molecular composition of small subcellular organelles are dynamically regu - lated but still subject to stochastic noise . Studying the biomolecular composition and size of organelles will illuminate the regulation and noise in these dynamically stable systems . A major challenge for such exploration , however , is the development of a combined approach for both resolving small structures below the optical diffraction limit and simultaneously counting biomolecules over several orders of magnitude ( Fig . 1 A ) . In the endocytic pathway , both vesicle morphology and bio - molecular composition are dynamically regulated along a mat - uration path . Formation of vesicles , tethering , fusion , and matu - ration to endosomes are controlled by over 60 proteins in concert with conversion of phosphoinositides ( PIs ) ( 4 , 5 ) . Phosphatases and PI - kinases produce phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) from plasma membrane phospholipids ( 6 ) . PI3P is required for endocytosis ( 7 ) and membrane transport to early and late endo - somes ( 8 , 9 ) . PI3P regulates the recruitment of proteins ( 10 ) , such as Rab GTPases , which coordinate many aspects of vesicle identity ( 11 , 12 ) and maturation to endosomes , including tethering and fusion ( 13 – 16 ) . These master regulators also modulate PI3P production ; thus , there is mutual regulation between PI3P and the Rabs ( 17 ) . Fluorescence microscopy has documented the localization and dynamic exchange of proteins and PIs at different stages in the endocytic pathway ( 18 – 20 ) . In addition , structural studies using electron microscopy complemented ﬂ uorescence studies by re - vealing the shape and size of vesicles below the optical diffraction limit together with qualitative protein localization ( 21 , 22 ) . How - ever , owing to limitations of high - resolution counting techniques , little is known about the relationship between the size and the exact biomolecular composition of endocytic and endosomal vesicles because these properties cannot be simultaneously measured by the same technique . Because size and biomolecular composition are major determinants of vesicle and endosome identity , such knowledge could reveal mechanistic insights into how protein and lipid conversion and vesicle fusion are regulated along the matu - ration path . A precise measurement of these parameters would allow us to study noise caused by stochastic ﬂ uctuations of involved components in the endosomal maturation pathway . Here , we develop an approach to simultaneously measure vesicle size and composition using superresolution microscopy . Single - molecule superresolution microscopy methods , more com - monly known as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( 23 ) or photoactivated localization microscopy ( 24 ) , are based on localizing individual photoactivatable ﬂ uorophores through ﬁ tting Signi ﬁ cance We combined molecule counting and superresolution micros - copy to observe the size , shape , and biomolecular composition of vesicles in the endocytic pathway . From a large number of steady - state snapshots , we follow the maturation of vesicles to endosomes . First , phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) is generated on newly formed vesicles , principally after they shed their clathrin coat . Next , PI3P sites increase ( ∼ 100 - fold ) on small vesicles whose size is tightly regulated . Finally , the GTPase Vps21 ( Rab5 homolog ) is associated with small endo - somal structures during the initial phase of PI3P production , whereas Ypt7 ( Rab7 homolog ) localizes to larger endosomal structures , which exhibit saturating levels of PI3P . This new technique opens up the possibility of accurately measuring molecular stoichiometries across several orders of magnitude while resolving subdiffraction - limit organelles .

These methods offer potential in - formation about the local number of molecules , especially when using photoactivatable ﬂ uorescent proteins ( PAFPs ) as the probe . However , they have associated over - and undercounting errors that must be corrected . For example , blinking of PAFPs such as mEos2 has been shown to cause overcounting artifacts ( 25 ) . Al - though previous studies devoted effort to calibrating these effects ( 25 – 28 ) , variation of photophysical properties with experimental conditions for compatible PAFPs complicates quantitative image reconstruction . In addition , undetected ﬂ uorescent proteins owing to problems such as misfolding lead to undercounting . Here , we develop an intracellular calibration approach for single - molecule superresolution microscopy by measuring the relevant photo - physical parameters in cells under imaging conditions to correct for blinking . By counting the number of molecules in protein complexes of de ﬁ ned stoichiometry , we then determine the frac - tion of undetected PAFPs , allowing us to calibrate and count absolute numbers of molecules . Applying this method to the yeast endocytic pathway allows us to simultaneously measure the size of vesicles and endosomes and the number of associated biomolecules , revealing a regu - lated maturation trajectory of lipid conversion and fusion . Established markers for different stages of vesicle - to - endosome maturation ( such as GTPases ) colocalize with distinct regimes on this maturation trajectory and reveal that the number of ac - cessible PI3P binding sites on vesicles increases about 100 - fold before they start to fuse . By analyzing vesicle - to - vesicle variability within and between cells , we identify noise sources in this mat - uration trajectory and con ﬁ rm our results by colocalization . Our approach sheds light on the endocytic pathway and paves the way for fundamental studies on the relationship between the number of biomolecules and the size of small intracellular structures . Results Calibration of Single - Molecule Superresolution Microscopy Eliminates Over - and Undercounting . The ﬁ rst challenge for accurately counting ﬂ uorescently labeled molecules is overcounting owing to blinking . As shown in previous studies , blinking of PAFPs can be corrected by combining ﬂ uorescent bursts from a single molecule based on a cutoff time determined from the measured characteristic dark - time distribution ( 25 , 27 ) . In addition , it has been previously reported that the detectable fraction of PAFPs can be substantially smaller than 100 % ( 29 – 31 ) . Both the blink characteristics and the detectable fraction are sensitive to the experimental conditions . To solve this problem , we measured both effects in cells under the exact same conditions as our actual experiments . Speci ﬁ cally , we created three yeast strains for calibration , each constitutively expressing low levels of either a single , double , or triple repeat of mEos2 ( 32 ) . The mEos2 repeats were fused to the plasma mem - brane - localized Pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of Plc δ , resulting in a ring of ﬂ uorophores around the periphery of the cell ( Fig . 1 B , Left ) . Before correction , blinking single mEos2 molecules falsely appear closely clustered in time and space ( Fig . 1 B , Top ) . By combining closely separated photoactivation events , we obtain the photon - weighted average position of each molecule ( Fig . 1 B , Top and Fig . S1 ) . The counting histogram was created by counting corrected molecule positions closer than 50 nm and by subtracting background counts from cells lacking mEos2 ( Fig . S2 ) . The small fraction of observed double counts is caused by randomly overlapping molecules . To evaluate our blink correction algorithm , we analyzed superresolution images with the pair - correlation function ( 33 ) ( Fig . 1 B , Right ) , which represents the distribution of distances between any pair of two localization points . Uncorrected data from 1 × - mEos2 cells produces a pair - correlation function with a pronounced peak ( Fig . 1 B , Top Right ) re ﬂ ecting the clustering of localizations caused by blinking . Blink correction results in a ﬂ at pair - correlation function , verifying the random distribution of ﬂ uorophores and proper blink correction ( Fig . 1 B , Top Right ) . In the blink - corrected data of 3 × - mEos2 constructs , up to three ﬂ uorophores appear in close proximity ( < 50 nm separa - tion ) . A portion of mEos2 molecules is undetected , resulting in observation of fewer than three molecules at same location . As a result , the counting histogram follows a binomial distribution B ( N , F ) ( Fig . 1 B , Bottom ) and again exhibits a shoulder owing to randomly overlapping 3 × - mEos2 molecules . When multiple fused mEos2 repeats are expressed , two or three mEos2 mole - cules colocalize , causing the pair - correlation functions of the 2 × - and 3 × - mEos2 constructs to display a peak at short distances . The width of the peak ( full width at half maximum 20nm ) rep - resents the experimental localization uncertainty ( Fig . 1 B , Middle [ PH ] 2 2x mEos2 B 1x m E o s2 m o l e c u l e s / μ m 2 100 nm 1 μ m PALM uncorr . blinkcorr . nu m b e r o f m o l ec u l es size of structures d i ff r a c t i on li m i t cell vacuole nucleus spindlepole body e ndo cy t i c vesiclesnuclear pore A l o c a li z a t i on s / μ m 2 m o l e c u l e s / μ m 2 uncorrectedcorrected 100806040200 1200 800 400 [ PH ] 2 mEos2 [ PH ] 2 3x mEos2 3x m E o s2 molecules / cluster c oun t s 400 300 200 100 0 8 6 4 2 0 2x 3x detectedfraction ( F ) 95 % quantile molecules cells 1x 487 1393 2025 56±2 % 53 / 59 % 53 / 65 % 59±3 % 35 29 33 C 2x m E o s2 c oun t s 200 150 100 50 0 N = 2 F = 59±3 % 80 60 40 20 0 m o l e c u l e s / c e ll 3 2 1 0stoichiometry c oun t s 200 150 100 50 0 N = 3 F = 56±2 % distance ( nm ) 200 100 0 300 5004003002001000 distance ( nm ) 300 200 100 0 200 100 0 300 m o l e c u l e s / μ m 2 8 6 4 2 0 molecules / cluster molecules / cluster86 4 2 0 mEos2 distance ( nm ) 200 100 0 300 Fig . 1 .

This improved localization precision compared with uncorrected data ( see peak width of uncorrected data , Fig . 1 B , Top ) results from combining all detected photons to de - termine each molecule ’ s position rather than distributing them over multiple blinks . By ﬁ tting the distribution of the observed number of PAFPs to the known numbers in our strains ( 1 × , 2 × , and 3 × - mEos2 ) , we determined the fraction of undetected mEos2 molecules to be about 40 % , allowing us to calibrate the observed number of PAFPs ( Fig . 1 C ) . Using this calibration , we can count the absolute number of PAFP - labeled molecules present in subcellular organelles and protein complexes of unknown stoichiometry with a resolution of 20 nm . As shown in SI Materials and Methods and Fig . S1 , this ap - proach holds for up to hundreds of molecules per organelle without undercounting artifacts owing to ﬂ uorescent overlap in time . Measuring Maturing Vesicle Size and Counting Accessible PI3P Binding Sites with Superresolution Microscopy . PIs de ﬁ ne the identity of endocytic vesicles and endosomal compartments by providing speci ﬁ c binding sites for structural and regulatory proteins ( 9 , 13 , 17 , 34 , 35 ) . To spatially resolve vesicles and si - multaneously measure the number of accessible PI3P binding sites on their surfaces , we expressed mEos2 fused to a PI3P - binding domain [ a double FYVE domain of EEA1 ( 19 , 34 ) ] . Although this reporter cannot detect PI3P molecules shielded by other proteins , it gives a stable measure ( see also Fig . 3 ) of the exposed pool also seen by regulatory proteins containing FYVE ﬁ ngers , such as Vac1p , Fab1p , and Vps27p . Constitutive FYVE – mEos2 expression is driven by the weak pCyc promoter to minimize possible interference with the endocytic pathway . In blink - corrected images , vesicles are detected with high contrast and resolved as circular structures ( Fig . 2 A ) . The high resolution not only enables us to resolve the size of vesicles but also to sep - arate vesicles that are close together . By applying our calibrated superresolution microscopy approach , the absolute number N of molecules in each vesicle as well as its diameter D are determined ( Fig . 2 B ) . Our detection range in the vertical direction is limited by diffraction to about 500 – 700 nm . Because the vesicles in this study are typically smaller ( mean diameter 80 nm ) , all molecules in a vesicle can be detected . We note , however , that the applica - tion of our technique to structures with size similar to or larger than the detection range would require imaging with different focal planes ( z - stacks ) to detect all molecules . Number of Exposed PI3P Sites and Vesicle Surface Area Display a Maturation Path . To study the distribution in PI3P content and size of maturing vesicles , we imaged over 50 cells and ana - lyzed 273 vesicles . Both vesicle diameters and number of ac - cessible PI3P binding sites display a broad range of values ( Fig . 2 C ) . The diameter of vesicles with very few PI3P binding sites may be slightly underestimated owing to an uneven distribution of detected molecules . However , the measured mean vesicle diameter ( 82 nm ) lies within the range obtained from electron microscopy studies on clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 22 ) . We next examined the degree to which the observed variability in size and PI3P content is random or subject to tight regulation . By plotting the number of accessible PI3P binding sites against the calculated surface area of 273 individual vesicles , we obtained a scatter plot populated in a clearly de ﬁ ned region ( Fig . 2 D ) . Vesicles with low to intermediate numbers of PI3P binding sites are relatively tightly distributed in size , but vesicles with several hundred binding sites show a signi ﬁ cant increase in size and size variation . Both small and large vesicles are found within the same cell ( Fig . 2 D , red ) , suggesting that our aggregate distribution represents a superresolution snapshot of dynamic processes oc - curring in each cell . Because PI3P is produced on incoming vesi - cles , which fuse during maturation , or on early endosomes , we hypothesized that this population of vesicles represents a matura - tion trajectory of PI3P production and vesicle fusion . To validate our counting of PI3P binding sites in individual vesicles , we combined superresolution with conventional ﬂ uo - rescence microscopy ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S3 ) . In this way , three independent parameters were obtained from each vesicle : their subdiffraction limit size , the number of one type of molecule ( superresolution with mEos2 ) , and the amount of a second molecular species ( conventional ﬂ uorescence with GFP ) . We coexpressed our calibrated FYVE – mEos2 construct with FYVE – GFP . Each vesicle now appears in both superresolution ( red ) and conventional GFP ( green ) channels . The mEos2 counting and the GFP intensity show a high correlation ( Pearson ’ s cor - relation coef ﬁ cient , ρ = 0 . 91 ; Fig . 3 B ) . This correlation validates our use of FYVE – mEos2 as a PI3P reporter . Characteristic PI3P Sites and Vesicle Size Are Conserved Between Cells ; Variation Is Due to Intrinsic and Extrinsic Noise . Stochastic gene expression leads to variability within a cell ( intrinsic noise ) as well as to phenotypic heterogeneity between cells ( extrinsic noise ) ( 1 ) . Logically , these sources of noise might also manifest themselves on the level of small intracellular organelles . We examined whether our observed vesicle population ( Fig . 2 D ) is caused by cell - to - cell variability or represents a trajectory of PI3P production and vesicle fusion present in each cell .

Vesicles in the endocytic pathway show characteristic relationship be - tween vesicle size and PI3P content . ( A ) A tandem repeat of the FYVE domain of EEA1 fused to mEos2 serves as a speci ﬁ c probe to detect accessible PI3P binding sites on endocytic / endosomal vesicles . mEos2 ( red ) localizes to distinct , circular vesicles within a yeast cell ( gray ) . ( B ) By applying our calibrated super - resolution microscopy approach , the number of mEos2 molecules ( N ) bound to PI3P on each vesicle is determined ( x ’ s ) . The molecular distribution exhibits a circular shape ( two peaks in a 1D projection ) . The diameter of vesicles ( D ) is determined by measuring the spatial spread of molecules . ( C ) Vesicles display variability in PI3Pcontent and size . Representative vesicles are shown displaying the expected circular shape . The histogram of vesicle diameters exhibits a ﬁ tted maximum at 82 nm . ( D ) PI3P content and vesicle surface area fall on a charac - teristic curve . Vesicleswith fewerthan 100moleculesdisplay relatively tight size regulation , whereas structures above this threshold are signi ﬁ cantly larger . Vesicles from each part of this characteristic distribution can be found within one individual cell ( red ) . This path is also displayed as an exponential function ( black line ) ﬁ tted to box - smoothed data with 95 % con ﬁ dence envelope . Puchner et al . PNAS | October 1 , 2013 | vol . 110 | no . 40 | 16017 C E LL B I O L O G Y subject to intrinsic noise ( Fig . 3 B ) , our experimental setup pro - vides the required accuracy . By analyzing multiple vesicles from individual cells ( Fig . 4 A , only cells with six or more vesicles are displayed ) , we observed that individual cells contain vesicles from all regions of the population . The majority of the spread in vesicle size and lipid content therefore seems to re ﬂ ect a regulated maturation trajectory of PI3P production and vesicle fusion in the endocytic pathway . The scattering of vesicles from individual cells around the trajectory , however , displays two sources of noise : systematic deviations above or below the mean path ( e . g . , red , blue and orange in Fig . 4 A ) and intrinsic scat - tering within a cell around the path ( e . g . , green , yellow , and pink in Fig . 4 A ) . Because both variations are larger than the experi - mental error , we conclude that intrinsic noise owing to variation of accessible PI3P binding sites between individual vesicles within a cell and extrinsic noise owing to variation between cells is present in the endocytic pathway ( Fig . 4 B ) . Landmark Proteins Associate with Distinct States of the Maturation Trajectory . To correlate our observed PI3P - size trajectory with the timeline of vesicle maturation , we performed two - color colocalization experiments between our PI3P reporter ( in the superresolution channel ) and landmark endocytic pathway pro - teins labeled with GFP ( in the conventional ﬂ uorescence chan - nel ) ( Fig . 5 A ) . We tagged three endocytic pathway proteins with GFP : ( i ) clathrin , present from the initial stages of membrane invagination and endocytic vesicle formation ( 18 ) ; ( ii ) the small GTPase Vps21 ( yeast homolog of Rab5 ) , an interaction partner of the PI3 - kinase that associates with incoming vesicles and early endosomes ; and ( iii ) the GTPaseYpt7 ( yeast homolog of Rab7 ) , found in late endosomes ( for reviews on Rabs see refs . 16 and 36 ) . Both GTPases are involved in tethering and fusion ( 15 , 37 ) and participate in different stages of endosomal maturation ( 11 ) . In each of the three sets of experiments , we counted PI3P binding sites and measured the size of individual vesicles as well as the amount of each GFP - tagged landmark protein . By plotting those vesicles with signi ﬁ cant GFP signal ( Fig . 5 B and Fig . S4 ) , we observed the same characteristic distribution of size and PI3P content . These three landmark proteins denote three distinct regimes in our observed distribution . Clathrin associates with very low PI3P - content vesicles , whose size and morphology in - dicate that these structures are early endocytic vesicles . In con - trast , Vps21 colocalizes with vesicles containing hundreds of PI3P molecules , but both clathrin - and Vps21 - associated regimes display tight regulation of vesicle size . Finally , Ypt7 associates with vesicles of signi ﬁ cantly larger size and containing the highest numbers of PI3P binding sites . This trend is also clear in the medians of each class and hand - drawn ellipses , which include more that 80 % of data points of each class ( Fig . 5 B , crosses and shaded ellipses , respectively ) . In general , more small individual vesicles are observed than large , Ypt7 - associated endosomes . Given that many individual vesicles fuse to form a larger endo - some , this observation is consistent with the conservation of lipid membrane along the maturation path . Discussion Quantifying the abundance and spatial distribution of bio - molecules in cells provides fundamental insights into biological processes such as compartmentalization , polarization , and sig - naling . Here we take this approach one step further to study the size and biomolecular composition of subcellular compartments using calibrated superresolution microscopy . This technique opens up new and exciting opportunities to quantitatively study processes in intracellular organelles and complexes . The identity of organelles is primarily de ﬁ ned by their morphology and bio - molecular composition , and our method provides fundamental characterization of these properties . From a large number of such measurements , insights can be obtained into how this identity is dynamically regulated along a path . Challenges for Counting Single Molecules with Superresolution Microscopy . Counting absolute molecule numbers remains chal - lenging because of overcounting owing to blinking and under - counting owing to a limited PAFP maturation ef ﬁ ciency . Several recent studies made progress in quantifying single - molecule superresolution microscopy data by correcting for dye blinking ( 25 – 28 ) . Other approaches calculated averaged spatial distri - butions of an ensemble of signaling complexes ( 33 , 38 ) or de - termined high mEos2 molecule numbers using an average number of blinking events ( 39 ) . One persistent problem is the strong environmental dependence of the photophysical param - eters required for blink correction and the fraction of unobserved ﬂ uorophores .

Experimental conditions such as environmental oxygen and redox potential or the intensity of excitation and photo - switching affect the ﬂ uorophore ’ s photophysical parameters ( 40 ) . These conditions may vary between cellular compartments and cell types . The fraction of undetected PAFPs also depends on environ - mental factors such as temperature , pH , and ﬁ xation conditions . Systematic measurement of the sum of these effects by counting ﬂ uorophores with known stoichiometry is critical for obtaining absolute molecule numbers and associated uncertainties . For fu - ture optimizations of PAFPs compatible with single - molecule superresolution microscopy , it is important to enhance not only their brightness and maturation rate but also photo - switching ca - pability , low transition rates to dark states , and short dark times . A Superresolution Snapshot of the Vesicle Maturation Trajectory : PI3P Production and Vesicle Fusion Occur at Different Stages . The appli - cation of calibrated superresolution microscopy to the yeast endocytic pathway allowed us to count the number of accessible PI3P binding sites , quantify their colocalization with endocytic or endosomal proteins , and correlate these numbers with vesicle size . The observed maturation trajectory of vesicles suggests an initial phase of PI3P production on vesicles whose size is tightly regu - lated , followed by a later phase in which fusion of these vesicles occurs . Previously it has been shown that Vps21 mediates vesicle tethering ( 37 ) , which precedes fusion . We are able to resolve tethered vesicles ( e . g . , in Fig . 5 A , middle row and column ) ; how - ever , consistent with the notion that fusion is fast , such events are very rarely observed . The PI3P content is highest in large , fused structures , which we interpret to be early and late endosomes based on their morphology and Vps21 / Ypt7 association . Owing to the increase in surface area in these larger structures , our ﬁ ndings indicate that most PI3P production occurs before vesicles start to fuse . As seen in Fig . 5 A , most of the large Ypt7 - associated endosomes exhibit complex , irregular morphology , consistent with EM studies in yeast that resolved the structure of endosomes and multivesicular bodies ( 41 ) . Owing to this complex morphology and 2D projection of the images , the calculated surface area of those large structures may be slightly underestimated . However , this underestimation does not affect our conclusion that most of the PI3P is produced on individual vesicles before they fuse . Because the endocytic pathway is conserved between yeast and mammalian cells , our results can be viewed in a broader context . It is well established that PI3P production is required for vesicle fusion and maturation ( 7 ) . In mammalian cells , the key proteins in this process are EEA1 ( homolog of yeast Fab1 ) , which binds to PI3P ( 34 , 42 ) and is thought to recruit and to effect Rab5 ( homolog of yeast Vps21 ) ( 10 ) . Rab5 in turn tethers vesicles ( 16 , 37 ) and interacts with the fusion complex CORVET ( 43 ) and through EEA1 with SNARE ( 44 ) . However , owing to the lack of a direct measurement , it is still debated whether PI3P is pro - duced on incoming vesicles , fused vesicles , or endosomes . Fur - ther experiments will help to dissect maturation events following Rab5 mediated fusion in more detail and study the role of other proteins involved in these processes . Dissecting Regulation and Noise with Multiple Parameters . Quanti - fying multiple parameters of a dynamic process with many static snapshots can illuminate both regulation and variability within the pathway . For intracellular organelles , the most important parameters are morphology / size and molecular composition . Our method allows us to track these parameters and to gain mechanistic insight into the overall pathway by dissecting dif - ferent regimes in the measured parameter space . In addition , we also obtain insights into intrinsic and extrinsic sources of noise by comparing parameter distributions within and between cells . In the case of our observed vesicle maturation trajectory , we found that vesicles from individual cells cover the whole range of the distribution , indicating a regulated process in each cell . The scattering of vesicles from individual cells around the trajectory is signi ﬁ cantly above our experimental error and displays two sources of noise : intrinsic noise owing to variation of accessible PI3P binding sites between individual vesicles within a cell and extrinsic noise owing to variation between cells . Certain endo - cytic proteins involved in lipid modi ﬁ cation and protein sorting are expressed at very low levels [ e . g . , Fab1 ( 149 copies per cell ) or Vps27 ( 172 copies per cell ) ( 45 ) ] , creating potentially large stochastic variations between vesicles and endosomes ( Fig . S5 ) . In contrast , the higher expression level of our PI3P reporter results in a lower coef ﬁ cient of variation ( see also high correlation Fig . 3 B ) and thus less intrinsic noise than some other endocytic pro - teins . By synthetically introducing noise in different nodes , future experiments on modi ﬁ ed endocytic pathways could reveal which parts are sensitive to , suppress , or amplify this variability . Quantitative superresolution microscopy also presents the opportunity to study clustering or polarity in small intracellular compartments ( 46 ) . Endosomal proteins are likely to have a complex spatial organization on vesicles that may be important for various processes in membrane traf ﬁ cking and sorting . We believe that our calibrated superresolution microscopy approach together with its ability for multiparameter quanti ﬁ cation will be useful for future mechanistic insight of dynamic processes below the diffraction limit .

Materials and Methods Sample Preparation . Yeast strains ( W303 ) ( see Tables S1 – S3 ) were grown at 30 °C overnight in synthetic media with glucose ( SD ) , diluted 1 : 50 in SD , and grown for 3 – 4 h to log phase in the dark . After immobilization on a Con A - coated coverslip , cells were ﬁ xed for 30 min with 4 % ( vol / vol ) formalde - hyde ( SI Materials and Methods gives details ) . Superresolution Microscopy . Superresolution measurements were performed ona custom - built microscope based on aNikon Ti - E inverted microscope with the Perfect Focus System . Photoactivation ( 405 nm laser , 1 – 160 μ W corre - sponding to a power density of roughly 0 . 06 – 10 W / cm 2 ) and simultaneous bright - ﬁ eld imaging in one frame was followed by nine frames with exci - tation ( 561nm , 17 mWcorresponding to apowerdensity of roughly 1kW / cm 2 ) ; this cycle was repeated until all mEos2 molecules were imaged and bleached ( SI Materials and Methods and Fig . S3 ) . Fluorescent intensity pro ﬁ les of single mEos2 molecules were ﬁ tted with Gaussians and drift corrected ( SI Materials and Methods and Fig . S1 ) . Calibration for Molecule Counting . To accurately calibrate our measurements in cells under imaging conditions , we measured the dark - time histogram of well - separated [ PH ] 2 - mEos2 molecules at the plasma membrane . Using this histogram , we determined that 99 % of the dark states of a single ﬂ uorophore last less than 2 . 66 s ( SI Materials and Methods and Fig . S1 ) . The pair - correlation function reveals that these bursts are spatially separated by less than 150 nm . Therefore , all ﬂ uorescent bursts separated by less than 150 nm and 2 . 66s were combined ( SI Materials and Methods and Fig . S1 ) . For the labeling densities in this study , combining ﬂ uorescent bursts in this way does not lead to under - counting artifacts owing to overlap in time ( Fig . S1 B ) . To determine the frac - tion of undetectable mEos2 molecules , counting histograms of the double and triple mEos2 repeats were noise - subtracted and ﬁ tted by a binomial distri - bution ( SI Materials and Methods and Fig . S2 ) . Two - Color Colocalization with Superresolution Structures . GFP was images after mEos2 to avoid potential crosstalk ( SI Materials and Methods and Figs . S3 and S4 ) . Images were background - subtracted and corrected for uneven illumination , and the total GFP intensity per vesicle was calculated ( SI Materials and Methods ) . Only vesicles with more than two FYVE – mEos2 molecules were analyzed ( SI Materials and Methods ) . Vesicles with a signif - icant GFP signal ( above the 90 % threshold , Fig . S4 ) are plotted in Fig . 5 B . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank Eva Schmid , Mark von Zastrow , Mark Marsh , Voytek Okreglak , Vito Mennella , Marcus Taylor , and the W . A . L . and B .
