Dysfunction of anucleate platelets is likely to be completely attributable to alterations in post - translational modifications and protein expression . We therefore examined the proteome of platelets highly purified from fresh blood donations , using elaborate protocols to ensure negligible contamination by leukocytes , erythrocytes and plasma . Utilizing quantitative mass spectrometry , we created the first comprehensive and quantitative human platelet proteome , comprised of almost 4 , 000 unique proteins , estimated copy numbers for ~ 3 , 700 of those , and assessed inter - subject ( 4 donors ) as well as intra - subject ( 3 different blood samples from one donor ) variations of the proteome . For the first time , our data allow for a systematic and weighted appraisal of protein networks and pathways in human platelets , and indicate the feasibility of differential and comprehensive proteome analyses from small blood donations . Since 85 % of the platelet proteome shows no variation between healthy donors , this study represents the starting point for disease - oriented platelet proteomics . In the near future , comprehensive and quantitative comparisons between normal and well - defined dysfunctional platelets , or between platelets obtained from donors at various stages of chronic cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases will be feasible .

Introduction Platelets play a crucial role in hemostasis and in the pathological genesis and progression of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases . As those are the major cause of death in industrialized countries , anti - platelet treatment is recognized as a pharmacological target of considerable importance . Patients suffering from cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease benefit from anti - platelet treatment through reduced prevalence of recurrent - mostly fatal - events and improved safety in case of angiographic intervention 1 . In recent years , however , evidence has been accumulating that a significant subset of patients does not respond adequately to certain drugs 2 - 4 . This insufficient responsiveness to anti - platelet treatment imposes an increased risk for severe cardiovascular or other adverse secondary events 5 and might be a direct consequence of differences in protein expression patterns and / or post - translational modification ( PTM ) states of individual humans . More recently , it has been increasingly recognized that platelets also have major inflammatory functions and affect innate and adaptive immunity and inflammatory diseases 6 . The anucleate nature of platelets renders proteomics a valuable tool to help and better understand physiological as well as pathophysiological proccesses related to hemostasis and thrombosis . In various proteomic studies , we and others identified ~ 2 , 000 proteins 7 - 13 , and more than 1 , 000 PTM in human platelets 12 , 14 , 15 . However from qualitative data conclusions can be inferred only to limited extent . Deeper understanding of the individual role and contribution of signaling components to the initiation and propagation of platelet activation demands quantitative data for the protein components involved as it allows a weighted appraisal of the relevance of diverse signaling pathways in platelet activation and inhibition , which is mandatory for reconstruction and modeling of pathways . In principle , quantitative global as well as PTM - centric proteomics of reproducibly prepared platelets might allow assessing differences between platelets from healthy individuals or from individual patients or patient cohorts . This appears of interest since platelets are not only a major component of hemostasis but serve as sensitive monitor of vascular integrity especially in chronic diseases . To assess the potential of quantitative proteomics to address these issues of utmost relevance , we conducted a systematic study determining the general biological variance of human platelets , freshly isolated from four healthy donors . We identified more than 2 , 500 personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 4 phosphorylation sites , almost 4 , 000 unique proteins and estimated copy numbers per platelet for ~ 3 , 700 of those . In addition , we relatively quantified ~ 1 , 900 proteins between four different donors ( inter - subject variation ) and ~ 1 , 500 proteins between three different blood donations of the same volunteer ( intra - subject variation ) , covering a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude . Our results clearly demonstrate on a global level that in both cases ~ 85 % of the platelet proteome show no variation . We calculate a total of ~ 20 million protein molecules per platelet , corresponding to 1 . 5 mg protein / 10 9 platelets which fits well to common laboratory values ( 1 . 8 + 0 . 2 mg ) . Based on this and the protein coverage we achieve for human platelet - related pathways taken from the manually curated Reactome website ( www . reactome . org ) , we estimate a coverage of 80 - 85 % of the entire platelet proteome , concluding that human platelets comprise approximately 5 , 000 rather than the afore - estimated 2 , 000 - 3 , 000 proteins 16 . Taken altogether , this study significantly improves our knowledge of quantitative platelet composition and biological variance , and demonstrates that quantitative proteomics is a powerful tool ready - to - use for conducting disease - related studies of high clinical relevance 17 - 19 , starting already with small blood donations . 2 . Material and Methods 2 . 1 Platelet isolation and purification Human platelets were prepared as reported 20 , with small modifications . The additional centrifugation step after dilution with buffer was introduced to remove leukocytes and improves sample purity substantially . Blood was obtained from healthy volunteers according to our institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki . Our studies with human platelets are approved and recently ( Sept . 24 , 2008 ) reconfirmed by the local ethics committee of the University of Würzburg ( Studies No . 67 / 92 and 114 / 04 ) . Blood was collected in ACD solution ( 12 mM citric acid , 15 mM sodium citrate , 25 mM D - glucose ) , apyrase and EGTA were added to final concentrations of 0 . 01 U / mL and 3 mM , respectively . Platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) was obtained by 5 min centrifugation at 330 g . To reduce leukocyte contamination , PRP was diluted 1 : 1 with PBS and centrifuged at 240 g for personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 5 10 min . Subsequently , the supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 430 g and pelleted platelets were washed once in CGS buffer ( 120 mM sodium chloride , 12 . 9 mM trisodium citrate , 30 mM D - glucose , pH 6 . 5 ) . A small aliquot was resuspended in HEPES buffer ( 150 mM sodium chloride , 5 mM potassium chloride , 1 mM magnesium chloride , 10 mM D - glucose , 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) to a final concentration of 3·10 8 platelets / mL for quantifying leukocyte contamination using a leukocount kit ( BD Biosciences ) . 2 . 2 Sample processing for quantitative mass spectrometry Experimental details for sample preparation / processing are given in the supplemental methods . To assess reproducibility of the entire workflow , proteolytic digests were controlled prior to LC - MS analysis 21 . To assess the inter - subject variance of the platelet proteome , samples from four donors were independently processed and individually labeled with iTRAQ on the peptide level . Thus , isobaric tags of different stable isotope compositions are attached to all primary amines ( free peptide N - termini and Lys residues ) which allows pooling of samples and consequently relative quantification based on specific reporter ion signal intensities in corresponding MS / MS spectra 22 . Experimental details for iTRAQ labeling , peptide fractionation , TiO 2 enrichment , mass spectrometry , spectrum processing and database searching are given in the supplemental methods . Search engine results were post - processed using the PeptideShaker software ( http : / / peptide - shaker . googlecode . com ) and peptide to spectrum matches ( PSM ) were exported to the PRIDE repository ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pride / ; accession numbers 22201 - 22203 , 22206 ) . 2 . 3 Protein quantification Spectrum counting for estimation of protein copy numbers was accomplished using the normalized spectral abundance factor ( NSAF ) 23 chosen for its robustness 24 . NSAF relates the number of identified mass spectra to the length of a protein as a measure of its abundance . To estimate copy numbers of the platelet proteome , NSAF were correlated with a set of 24 personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 6 reference proteins for which copy numbers were found in the literature ( table 1 ) . Relative quantification between donors was conducted using the iTRAQ methodology . Details are given in the supplemental methods . 2 . 4 Comparison of quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics data We compared our quantitative proteome data with RNAseq data from Rowley et al . 25 and with SAGE data from Dittrich et al . 26 as well as quantitative proteome data from HeLa 27 and U2OS 28 cells . Details are given in the supplemental methods . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 Sample purity In contrast to cell culture models , for proteome analyses of primary tissues and blood components such as platelets , sample preparation and purity have to be considered thoroughly . Since in apheresis platelet concentrates changes in activity and degradation can alter proteome patterns , we decided to analyse platelets directly isolated from fresh blood donations , based on an optimized protocol guaranteeing high purity 20 . As determined by the leukocount kit , all platelet samples contained less than 1 leukocyte per 10 6 platelets and less than 1 erythrocyte per 10 4 platelets . 3 . 2 The platelet proteome In this study we initially identified more than 3 , 700 proteins in human platelets with a false discover rate ( FDR ) of < 1 % using a multi - pronged approach ( figure 1 ) . We conducted a two - step enrichment of phosphopeptides with low and high selectivity to identify additional proteins which were not accessible to the global approach – most likely due to low abundance and / or the presence of only few unique peptides within the respective sequences . This led to the identification of 1 , 355 and 1 , 052 phosphorylation sites of high and personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 7 lower confidence ( regarding the unambiguous localization of the phosphoamino acid ) from 263 additional proteins at < 1 % FDR ( supplemental table 2 ) . Since global proteomics studies are generally biased against membrane proteins 29 , we added ~ 200 further proteins which were only confidently identified in our previous platelet membrane proteome study 11 , generating a combined dataset comprising in total ~ 4 , 200 proteins ( supplemental table 3 ) . 3 . 3 Estimation of protein copy numbers Protein abundance estimation was conducted based on NSAF . Since non - unique peptides , shared between different proteins still pose a major challenge to proteomics , these might lead to deviations of estimated copy numbers for isoforms / homologs . Thus , ambiguous peptide sets derived exclusively from different protein isoforms or homologous proteins were considered as protein groups in our final proteome dataset ; ambiguous peptide sets derived from non - related proteins were omitted . Based on the correlation to 24 reference proteins ( table 1 ) , copy numbers for 3 , 718 identified protein / protein groups were estimated , ranging from 2 . 2(cid:0)10 6 ( actin ) to less than 500 copies per platelet for low abundant proteins . In general our data surprisingly well correlate with known literature values yielding a Pearson coefficient of R² = 0 . 90 . Notably , these copy numbers are estimates which shall provide researchers a general overview of platelet composition - although in good accordance with the current knowledge , in individual cases copy number estimates can significantly differ from real copy numbers . This can be attributed to general limitations of large - scale spectral counting based quantification of cells , which comprise sample preparation ( e . g . tryptic digestion ) , mass spectrometric detection / identification and data interpretation . ( 1 ) Only unique peptides can be unambiguously assigned to a single protein rendering protein isoforms problematic , ( 2 ) hydrophobic proteins can be depleted during sample preparation , ( 3 ) proteins with multiple transmembrane domains ( TMD ) generate comparatively few tryptic peptides accessible for the analysis and may be underestimated , ( 4 ) proteins which are extensively modified ( e . g . glycosylated ) are underrepresented since digestion might and identification will be hampered . personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 8 In case of CD9 the reported 49 , 000 copies in the literature differ extremely from the estimated 8 , 000 copies in our study . This discrepancy might be ascribed to the generation of only two fully tryptic peptides < 20 amino acids ( and three additional ones > 25 amino acids ) , due to the presence of four TMD within only 228 amino acids . From the obtained copy numbers and the corresponding protein molecular weights , we calculate an approximate protein concentration of 1 . 5 mg per 10 9 platelets which is in close agreement with typical laboratory reference values ( 1 . 8 + 0 . 2 mg ) . The final list of identified proteins and copy numbers is given in supplemental table 3 . 3 . 4 Comparison to transcriptome data To compare our proteome to transcriptome and SAGE RNA data , we generated a merged dataset comprising 9 , 505 entries , 8 , 070 of which referring to individual proteins ( 3 , 598 from proteomics , 6 , 202 from RNAseq and 2 , 737 from SAGE ) . The overlap between all three datasets is considerably low with 8 % , whereas 12 % , 38 % and 9 % of proteins were exclusively found in proteome , RNAseq and SAGE data , respectively . From the 20 th percentile of the proteins quantified by RNAseq , 71 % are shared with proteome data , whereas from the 20 th percentile of the MS - derived proteins , 85 % are shared with RNAseq data . However , for the most frequent proteins / transcripts no correlation of RPKM and protein copy number can be observed ( R 2 < 0 . 1 ) . Purity of all datasets was evaluated based on 68 established CD markers ( table 2 ) selected from UniProt ( http : / / www . uniprot . org / docs / cdlist ) , HPRD ( http : / / www . hprd . org / ) and the BD Biosciences CD marker handbook , of which 28 were shown to be expressed in platelets . Indeed , all of these except for CD23 , but also two established non - platelet proteins , CD81 and CD97 , were identified in our proteome . CD37 , present in ~ 110 , 000 copies per leukocyte 30 , is also present in platelets ( own FACS data ) . It was also identified by Dowal et al . in their recent analysis of platelet palmitoylation 13 , and is estimated to ~ 790 copies per platelet based on our MS data . In comparison , RNAseq data contain 15 non - platelet CD marker transcripts , whereas in the SAGE data 5 non - platelet markers were found , yet at significantly higher rates than in the RNAseq data . personal use only .

The integrin heterodimer α2bβ3 is the most relevant integrin for platelet aggregation , acting as fibrinogen receptor . The two subunits are found almost equally expressed in the proteome ( 83 , 000 and 64 , 200 copies ) and also in the transcriptome ( 1357 and 1223 RPKM in RNAseq ) . The subunits of the von - Willebrand factor receptor GPIX / Ibα / Ibβ / V are found in stoichiometric ratios of 1 . 00 : 0 . 58 : 1 . 51 : 0 . 93 in the proteome while GPIbα is missing in the transcriptome data and GPV is only detected in trace amounts . Collagen interacts with platelets via the integrin α2β1 , GPIV or GPVI / Fc receptor gamma complex . Glycoprotein GPIV is the most abundant of these followed by GPVI / FcRg ( 1 . 00 : 0 . 85 stoichiometry ) and α2β1 ( 2 : 1 stoichiometry ) . In quantitative proteomics the Iα ( P10644 ) , Iβ ( P31321 ) , IIα ( P13861 ) , and IIβ ( P31323 ) regulatory and α ( P17612 ) and β ( P22694 ) catalytic subunit isoforms of PKA were found . The regulatory to catalytic subunit stoichiometry as derived from proteomics data with 1 : 0 . 82 is close to the expected 1 : 1 ratio and with ~ 9 , 600 copies of catalytic subunit twice as much as published 31 . In contrast , RNAseq data are clearly deviating , not reflecting the expected stoichiometry . 3 . 6 Pathway analysis We analyzed the coverage of known platelet pathways for G - protein - , integrin - , calcium - and cyclic nucleotide - signaling . Due to the central role of G - protein signaling in platelet regulation , we analyzed proteome , RNAseq and SAGE data with respect to the presence of G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCR ) . Whereas the platelet transcriptome contains 20 GPCR ( 19 in RNAseq and 4 in SAGE ) , our initial proteome dataset comprised only four : ADA2A , PAR4 , P2Y12 and V1AR , with an additional 7 GPCR present in our previous membrane study ( included in the final dataset supplemental table 3 ) . This discrepancy between the global and the membrane - dedicated study can be mainly attributed to the combination of ( a ) low abundance , ( b ) strong hydrophobicity ( 7 TMD ) and ( c ) sample complexity , impeding generation as well as detection of proteotypic peptides in case of global studies . Amisten et personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 10 al . evaluated the gene expression profile of platelet GPCR 32 with PAR1 ( 292 nd highest abundance in our platelet membrane proteome ) and P2Y12 ( 296 th ) receptors being the prevalent GPCR followed by SUCR1 ( not present ) , P2Y1 ( 482 nd ) and LPA ( 530 th ) receptors , in agreement with our previous results 11 as well as RNAseq data . For G - protein alpha subunits , the inhibitory G α - subunits ( Gi α 1 - 3 , G α Z ) account for 61 % , followed by G α Q with 24 % , G α 12 with 10 % and G α S with 5 % of all subunit copies . The corresponding Gβ and Gγ subunits are almost equally ( 34 , 400 vs . 42 , 300 copies ) yet less expressed than G α subunits . In contrast , in RNAseq data G α S is found almost exclusively ( 82 % ) and in SAGE data G α 13 and G α i2 together account for 72 % of all Gα subunit transcripts . A steep increase of intracellular calcium constitutes the initial and essential signal for platelet activation 33 . Two major mechanisms contribute to the fast increase : calcium entry through the non - selective P2X1 ion channel and mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores 34 . P2X1 is the only ligand gated calcium channel identified in the proteome and the transcriptome and found at a moderate copy number ( 1 , 400 ) . Calcium mobilization occurs through IP3 receptors ( Inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate receptor type 1 , 2 , and 3 with 2 , 400 , 1 , 700 , 750 copies ; IRAG with 3 , 500 copies ) . IP3 is formed from phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate by phospholipase C which is expressed in several subtypes and isoforms ( PLCB2 , PLCB3 , PLCB4 , PLCG2 : 2 , 500 , 1 , 700 , 1 , 000 , 2 , 000 copies ) . The secondary calcium influx can be achieved by two major pathways which have been proposed for platelets : the calcium sensor / calcium release activated channel ( STIM1 / CRAC ) and transient receptor potential channels ( TRPC ) 35 , 36 . Apparently both pathways are present in human platelets ( STIM1 : 7 , 400 , CRACM1 : 1 , 700 , TRPC6 : 1 , 100 copies ) . However proposed interaction partners of STIM1 such as TRPC1 and IPLA2 37 or other TRPC were detected neither in the platelet proteome nor the transcriptome . For the resting state of platelets , maintaining low intracellular calcium levels is fundamental . While plasma membrane calcium transporters are only present in low copy numbers ( CaATPases PMCA4 : 640 , and ATPase 2C1 : 2 , 200 , Na + / Ca 2 + Exchanger SLC8A3 : 580 ) , mitochondrial calcium transporter ( MCU , MICU1 , 5 , 900 , 1 , 400 ) and particularly ER / SR CaATPases ( SERCA2 and 3 with 9 , 000 and 16 , 300 ) which also maintain the filling state of Ca - stores are found in exceedingly high quantity . These numbers underline the outstanding importance of intracellular calcium stores for platelet calcium regulation 38 . personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 11 The major endogenous platelet inhibitory pathways are based on cyclic nucleotide regulation . cAMP is formed by adenylyl cyclases which are anchored in the cell membrane by two 6 - TMD each . In our proteome data only adenylyl cyclase 6 ( ADCY6 ) is present , while in our membrane proteome and in the RNAseq data , AC3 and AC5 are present as well . As expected from previous studies from us and others , only soluble guanylyl cyclase could be detected in platelets : In all datasets solely GC α3 ( Q02108 ) and β β 1 ( Q02153 ) subunits are present , with quantitative proteomics indicating a 1 : 1 stoichiometry ( 3 , 500 and 3 , 700 copies ) . Cyclic nucleotides are degraded by 3 ' , 5 ' cyclic phosphodiesterases - in our current understanding platelets predominantly express three phosphodiesterases : PDE2A , PDE3A , and PDE5A , with PDE5A being the most relevant . Deducing PDE stoichiometries from different data sources results in similar ratios : ( a ) 1 . 00 : 0 . 17 : 0 . 04 for PDE5 : PDE3 : PDE2 from Western blot 39 , ( b ) 1 . 00 : 0 . 07 : 0 . 04 from RNAseq and ( c ) 1 . 00 : 0 . 12 : ( n / a ) from quantitative proteomics , with PDE2 only detected after phosphopeptide enrichment , most likely due to low abundance . Combining quantitative proteomics and Western blot data < 300 copies per platelet can be estimated . The major effectors of cyclic nucleotides are the cyclic nucleotide dependent protein kinases PKA and PKG . Of the PKG subtypes only PKGI is consistently found in all datasets , yet proteome data indicate a 6 - fold lower expression ( 3 , 500 copies ) than literature data 31 . Generally , the comparison with transcriptome data clearly indicates that platelet transcripts do not reliably reflect protein expression . The lack of correlation with copy numbers , even for highly expressed proteins , and the rather unlikely frequency distribution of transcriptome data suggest that in platelets the occurrence of proteins is not interrelated to the presence of transcripts . 3 . 7 Global analysis of the platelet proteome and comparison to quantitative proteome data from human cell lines To further assess the general quality / coverage of the present dataset on a global scale and thus evaluate whether it is in accordance with current knowledge , we analyzed our ~ 4 , 200 platelet proteins with regard to enriched GO terms and coverage of platelet - related pathways in the Reactome database . Although validity and integrity of the underlying personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 12 protein - interaction and function databases are a matter of debate , the obtained information can nevertheless help to appraise the quality and reasonableness of proteomic data and furthermore allows for comparing large - scale proteomic data . Compared to the human proteome ( Uniprot human , ~ 18 , 000 entries ) , our platelet proteome is highly enriched in GO terms which can be related to platelet function , such as “endomembrane system” , “actin cytoskeleton” , “platelet alpha granule” , “platelet dense granule” , “intracellular signal transduction” or “filopodium” . Among the ten most significantly enriched pathways were “platelet activation” , “hemostasis” , “response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca 2 + ” , “membrane trafficking” and “platelet degranulation” . Surprisingly this analysis also suggested an important role for ubiquitination in platelet regulation . As all the aforementioned data confirm a highly pure and comprehensive analysis of the platelet proteome , we analyzed several platelet - specific human pathways in the Reactome database more in detail , namely “GPVI signaling” ( stable identifier React _ 1695 . 3 ) , “GP1b - IX - V signaling” ( React _ 23847 . 2 ) , “platelet homeostasis” ( React _ 23876 . 2 ) and “thrombin signaling through PAR” ( React _ 21384 . 2 ) ( all summarized in supplemental table 4 ) . However , here one of the limitations of global proteome analyses , that oftentimes isoform - resolution and differentiation of highly homolog proteins is not possible due to the absence of sufficient unique peptide sequences , has to be considered . Hence , some small G - proteins or PP2A and PDE subunits are missing ; we therefore considered these as protein groups as usually several but not all of these members / subunits were unambiguously detected ( in analogy to our final protein list ) . Thus , we achieve 97 % ( 32 out of 33 proteins ) coverage of the Reactome “GPVI signaling” pathway , 90 % ( 9 / 10 ) coverage of “GP1b - IX - V signaling” , 90 % ( 18 / 20 ) coverage of “platelet homeostasis” and 89 % ( 8 / 9 ) coverage of “thrombin signaling through PAR” . Concluding , we estimate a coverage of 80 - 85 % of the complete platelet proteome , even when taking into account missing isoforms . To reveal discrepancy or congruency of protein expression and copy numbers between proteomes of human platelets and human cell lines , we aligned our data to quantitative proteome data from HeLa 27 and U2OS 28 cells . The combined data sets encompass a total of 9 , 696 individual proteins ( disregarding splice variants ) . The overlap is rather complete with only 4 % of the proteins exclusively found in platelets , 69 % present at least in two sets and personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 13 27 % in all sets ( figure 2 ) . 32 % of the platelet proteome overlap with both sets . The overlap of the highly expressed proteins ( 95 th percentile ) of each dataset ( platelets , HeLa , U2OS ) is clearly higher . 58 % of the 671 proteins in this set are present in all three cells and 88 % in at least two cells . A subset of 28 proteins ( 4 % ) is exclusively present in platelets and is mainly composed of γ - actin , glycoproteins and platelet and coagulation factors ( supplemental table 5a ) . According to Engelhard et al . 41 the coverage of the total protein mass for the HeLa proteome is ~ 51 % , compared to 80 % for the platelet proteome , whereas for U2OS data an appropriate analysis was not possible due to the cutoff thresholds in the data . The frequency distribution of logarithmized copy numbers indicates almost identical maximum and full width at half maximum values for HeLa ( μ = 4 . 4 , σ = 1 . 03 ) and U2OS ( μ = 4 . 2 , σ = 0 . 85 ) . In contrast , the maximum of the frequency distribution of the platelet proteome is shifted to lower copy numbers and is narrowed ( μ = 3 . 16 , σ = 0 . 55 ) reflecting the lower protein expression levels and a limited protein inventory ( figure 2 ) . Protein copy numbers of the different cells do neither correlate for the complete proteome nor subsets based on the stratified data . The ratio of copy numbers for the platelet proteome in relation to the HeLa proteome is mainly between 0 . 02 and 0 . 1 , in relation to the U2OS proteome between 0 . 05 and 0 . 5 ( supplemental table 5b ) . The distribution of protein sizes in the three data sets is almost identical to the total human proteome as provided by Swissprot , demonstrating the absence of any bias for protein size in mass spectrometry analysis . In summary , the qualitative comparison of the human platelet proteome to HeLa and U2OS proteomes indicates considerable similarities which are virtually independent from copy numbers , while the distribution of copy numbers is similar for the three cell types . However , for platelets the smaller cell volume shifts the mean of the frequency distribution to lower copy numbers , whereas highly expressed proteins exclusively found in the platelet proteome are typical platelet proteins . 3 . 8 Potential contamination with other blood components Since estimated copy numbers and stoichiometries in this study substantially reflect and extend present knowledge , we addressed the important issue of contamination with other personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 14 blood components . In particular the sponge - like structure of platelets 42 leads to an extensive perfusion of the open canalicular system with plasma components . Consequently , a complete removal of plasma components is almost unattainable and it remains questionable to which extent the respective plasma proteins indeed are an actual and vital part of the platelet proteome . We therefore compared our dataset with the so far most comprehensive plasma proteome study providing concentration estimates for a large set of plasma proteins 43 . Indeed , 149 of the 150 most abundant plasma components are also present in our dataset ( supplemental table 3 ) , with albumin estimated to ~ 53 , 000 copies per platelet . The established concentration of albumin in plasma ( 50 mg / mL ) corresponds to the occurrence of ~ 450 , 000 copies per fL . Considering the mean platelet volume of 9 . 7 + 0 . 5 fL , we conclude that our samples contained approximately 1 percent by volume ( 0 . 1 fL ) plasma per platelet . From the occurrence of the second most abundant plasma protein transthyretin ( 0 . 77 mg / mL corresponding to 29 , 000 copies per fL ) at 4 , 500 copies per platelet , almost the same share , namely 1 . 5 percent by volume ( 0 . 15 fL ) plasma per platelet can be deduced . Considering that a significant amount of hemoglobin can be ascribed to marginal hemolysis during platelet preparation a relevant contamination by erythrocytes can almost be ruled out . The absence of one of the most abundant erythrocyte proteins , the band 3 anion transporter ( 1 , 000 , 000 copies per erythrocyte ) 44 , underlines this assumption . However , even if the detected hemoglobin ( 280 , 000 , 000 copies per erythrocyte ) resulted from erythrocytes , the estimated 61 , 000 copies would account for less than 1 erythrocyte per 5 , 000 platelets . 3 . 9 Platelet proteome variation For the 1 , 900 proteins relatively quantified between four different donors and covering a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude , we calculated SD over the obtained ratios – with the resulting median SD over all quantified proteins amounting to 0 . 14 . To account for ( a ) technical variations during sample processing and ( b ) MS analysis , we classified all proteins with SD 2x higher than the median SD as potentially differential . Although this is significantly lower than the usually expected biological variance between humans ( > > 2x ) , 85 % of the quantified proteins are below this cutoff and therefore show no / almost no variation between the analyzed donors . personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 15 Whereas individual deviations increase with lower copy numbers , there is no clear tendency towards variation for low abundant proteins ; ¼ of all proteins and ¼ of the proteins with SD > 0 . 28 have less than 1 , 000 copies per platelet . To assess the impact of a single outlier ratio ( i . e . one donor ) , for those proteins with SD > 0 . 28 , we determined SD 3patients values when omitting the most deviating ratio and set the SD 3patients cutoff to 0 . 14 ( 1x median SD ) . Then , still 171 proteins ( 9 % ) show potential variation . The group of differential proteins comprises potential / known contaminants such as Hemoglobin , MHC molecules and apolipoproteins , most likely due to slight differences during platelet isolation . In principle for individual proteins a differing degree of PTM as well as single amino acid exchanges might simulate a variation in protein abundance , caused by the reduced recovery of respective peptide sequences . In contrast , proteins central to platelet function have low SD which predominantly reflect the technical error of iTRAQ - based protein quantification ( ~ 20 % ) : GPIbα 0 . 05 ; GPIbβ 0 . 11 ; GPIV 0 . 16 ; GPVI 0 . 24 ; GPIX 0 . 10 ; PAR4 0 . 25 ; Platelet basic protein 0 . 09 ; Platelet factor 4 0 . 13 ; STIM1 0 . 07 ; P2X1 0 . 17 ; VASP 0 . 11 ; LASP 0 . 10 ; PKA ~ 0 . 20 ; PKG 0 . 10 ; Actin ~ 0 . 10 . In principle , these results agree with Winkler et al . who compared platelets from healthy donors using the difference in gel electrophoresis ( DIGE ) strategy and determined a coefficient of variation ( CV ) of 18 % based on the relative quantification of 500 reproducibly found spots 45 . However , 2D gel spots can easily contain up to 10 or more proteins , rendering accurate and global quantification on the protein level challenging . In contrast , in this study 1 , 900 proteins were relatively quantified by MS ( CV of 13 % ) yielding a substantial increase of quantitative information . Additionally , we assessed the intra - donor variation by quantitatively analyzing platelet samples purified from three different blood donations of the same donor . We independently processed two technical replicates per sample and analyzed all six samples without prefractionation by LC - MS . Since omitting the prefractionation reduced the number of identified spectra per protein , the obtained NSAF values were used only for relative comparison . From the 1 , 505 proteins which were identified in all samples with high confidence ( CV 12 . 2 % ) , ~ 85 % showed no variation ( CV > 24 . 4 % ) . Furthermore , technical variances determined using the two replicates per sample were 12 . 7 % , 14 . 8 % and 13 . 8 % , personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 16 respectively ( supplemental table 6 ) . Only seven proteins were considered as regulated in both intra - and inter - subject comparisons , namely DDX3X , SAMM50 , UQCRH , GLTP , EIF5A , BCL2L1 and ACAA1 , of which three are of mitochondrial origin . These results confirm that platelet formation as membrane encapsulated fragments of megakaryocytes is a highly reproducible and regulated process . 4 . Conclusion We conducted a systematic and thorough proteomic characterization of highly pure human platelets , ( a ) identifying ~ 4 , 000 platelet proteins , ( b ) estimating copy numbers per platelet for ~ 3 , 700 of those , relatively quantifying expression levels of ( c ) 1 , 900 proteins between four healthy donors and ( d ) 1 , 500 proteins between three different blood samples of the same donor . Based on leukocount and quantitative proteome data we conclude that the contamination with other blood components is negligible : e . g . 1 leukocyte per 10 6 platelets and 1 . 0 - 1 . 5 % by volume plasma per platelet , which can be mainly attributed to the sponge - like structure of the open canalicular system . To estimate copy numbers per platelet for the identified proteins , we utilized the established NSAF approach which we previously demonstrated as robust method for quantifying proteins in complex mixtures . We related the obtained NSAF values to a set of copy numbers found in the literature and found a surprisingly high degree of correlation ( R² = 0 . 90 ) . Although absolute quantification based on spectral counting can suffer from errors up to 200 % in individual cases ( membrane proteins or proteins with an unusually frequent occurrence of PTM ) , known protein complex stoichiometries can be confirmed and unknown deduced . To this end , our study provides a first comprehensive insight into the qualitative and quantitative platelet composition , allowing for a weighted appraisal of the physiological relevance of distinct pathways and thus represents a rich source for the systematic search for novel platelet functions and mechanisms . In addition , our quantitative proteomic comparisons between four healthy donors as well as three different blood samples from the same donor demonstrate that , despite the dynamics of the proteome and the high biological variance between human beings , platelet formation personal use only . For at North Carolina State University Libraries on September 28 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From 17 from megakaryocytes is a highly regulated and reproducible process yielding only minor differences in protein expression patterns . As we demonstrate , thorough and monitored isolation of platelets from fresh blood donations , combined with quality controlled sample preparation and proteomic analysis yield highly reproducible data . Thus , results and analytical strategy of the present study build a foundation for future investigations which can directly address issues of utmost clinical relevance such as differences in the response to anti - platelet treatment or in the pathological potential for the genesis of cardiovascular diseases . Since between healthy donors > 85 % of the proteome show no variation , by combining an elaborate quantitative analytical strategy and the appropriate individual patient and / or patient cohort ( and size ) with the right scientific questions , novel biomarkers , drug targets or key mediators of platelet function can be identified starting from small blood donations . In principle already less than 100 µg of protein per donor ( ~ 4·10 7 platelets , a few ml of blood ) will be sufficient indicating that platelet proteome analyses of individual donors and / or patients is possible . The quantitative results presented in our paper demonstrate the feasibility to assess on a global scale qantitative protein differences between ( a ) normal and well - defined dysfunctional platelets from individual persons , ( b ) platelets with normal and pathological response to antiplatelet drugs , and ( c ) platelets obtained from patients at various stages of chronic cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases . Some of such ambitious studies are currently initiated . 5 .

( A ) Platelets were isolated from fresh blood donations , lysed , proteins were carbamidomethylated and digested using trypsin . ( B ) Quantitative analysis was conducted in a two - pronged way . 1 . For absolute quantification of protein copy numbers , equal amounts of digest from the four donors were combined and peptides separated by in - solution isoelectric focusing . Obtained fractions were analysed by LC - MS / MS on an LTQ Obritrap Velos and copy numbers were calculated based on the NSAF method . 2 . For quantifying the biological variance of the human platelet proteome , 100 µg of each sample were labeled with iTRAQ 114 , 115 , 116 and 117 , respectively . Samples were multiplexed and fractionated using different techiques , namely SCX , IEF , HILIC and COFRADIC . Obtained fractions were analyzed by LC - MS on Orbitrap XL and Qstar Elite mass spectrometers . ( C ) To increase the coverage of the human platelet proteome , a two - step TiO 2 enrichment , first with low and then with high specificity for phosphopeptides was conducted and samples analyzed by LC - MS / MS on a q - Exactive mass spectrometer . personal use only .

( A ) All three proteomes show a remarkable overlap , which is virtually independent from copy numbers . ( B ) The distribution of copy numbers is similar for the three proteomes . However , due to the smaller cell volume in platelets the mean of the frequency distribution is shifted to lower copy numbers which is in accordance with Lundberg et al . who reported a correlation between cell size and protein expression levels 40 . ( C ) Contribution of proteins to the total protein mass in the platelet proteome : only 18 proteins account for 20 % , 171 proteins for 50 % and 680 proteins for 75 % of the total protein mass in human platelets . personal use only .
