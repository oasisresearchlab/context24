ARTICLE LIVE - PAINT allows super - resolution microscopy inside living cells using reversible peptide - protein interactions Curran Oi 1 , 2 , Zoe Gidden 3 , Louise Holyoake 3 , Owen Kantelberg 4 , Simon Mochrie 2 , 5 , Mathew H . Horrocks 4 ✉ & Lynne Regan 6 ✉ We present LIVE - PAINT , a new approach to super - resolution ﬂ uorescent imaging inside live cells . In LIVE - PAINT only a short peptide sequence is fused to the protein being studied , unlike conventional super - resolution methods , which rely on directly fusing the biomolecule of interest to a large ﬂ uorescent protein , organic ﬂ uorophore , or oligonucleotide . LIVE - PAINT works by observing the blinking of localized ﬂ uorescence as this peptide is reversibly bound by a protein that is fused to a ﬂ uorescent protein . We have demonstrated the effectiveness of LIVE - PAINT by imaging a number of different proteins inside live S . cerevisiae . Not only is LIVE - PAINT widely applicable , easily implemented , and the modi ﬁ cations minimally per - turbing , but we also anticipate it will extend data acquisition times compared to those previously possible with methods that involve direct fusion to a ﬂ uorescent protein . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 01188 - 6 OPEN 1 Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry , Yale University , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . 2 Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology , Yale University , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . 3 School of Biological Sciences , University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh EH9 3DW , Scotland . 4 School of Chemistry , The University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh EH9 3FJ , Scotland . 5 Department of Physics , Yale University , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . 6 Center for Synthetic and Systems Biology , Institute of Quantitative Biology , Biochemistry and Biotechnology , School of Biological Sciences , University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh EH9 3BF , Scotland . ✉ email : mathew . horrocks @ ed . ac . uk ; lynne . regan @ ed . ac . uk COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 458 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 01188 - 6 | www . nature . com / commsbio 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; O ptical microscopy has traditionally been restricted to a resolution of ~ 250 nm due to the diffraction limit of light . New methods , collectively grouped under the term super - resolution microscopy , have increased the resolution of ﬂ uores - cence microscopy by almost two orders of magnitude , allowing systems previously inaccessible to ﬂ uorescence microscopy to be studied 1 – 5 . These methods rely on either limiting the illumination of the sample to regions smaller than the diffraction limit 1 , or stochastically and temporally separating the emission of indivi - dual ﬂ uorophores to allow their positions to be precisely loca - lized . This latter strategy is termed single - molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) , and various approaches have been devel - oped to enable the required stochastic emission , including stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) 5 , photo - activation localization microscopy ( PALM ) 2 , and point accumu - lation for imaging in nanoscale topography ( PAINT ) 6 . In the original implementation of PAINT , ﬂ uorescent mole - cules ( for example , Nile red ) bind transiently and non - speci ﬁ cally to hydrophobic regions of a structure 6 , and a super - resolution image is built up as each one is localized . Unlike PALM and STORM methods , which are limited by photobleaching of the dye molecules over time , in PAINT - based methods there is continual replenishment of the ﬂ uorescent probes , which allows much longer imaging times , resulting in a higher density of localiza - tions , and the potential for a higher resolution image 7 . In all PAINT methods , the concentration of the interacting ﬂ uorescent molecule can be varied and optimized . DNA - PAINT was developed to enable speci ﬁ c and ﬁ nely tunable binding of the ﬂ uorophore to the structure to be imaged 8 . It relies on covalently attaching a short oligonucleotide sequence to the biomolecule of interest . A super - resolution image is built up as ﬂ uorescently labeled DNA oligonucleotides of com - plementary sequence to the oligonucleotide attached to the bio - molecule of interest , transiently hybridize with it and thus are localized . DNA - PAINT is attractive because it is relatively straightforward to vary the strength of strand association by varying the sequence or length of the DNA oligonucleotides . The reversibility of duplex formation allows for replenishment of signal at the position of interest by restricting the illuminated volume of the sample , for example , using total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) or light - sheet ﬂ uorescence microscopy . Thus , only ﬂ uorophores in the illuminated portion of the sample are bleached and they will be replaced by unbleached ﬂ uorophores when the DNA strands dissociate . By having a large reservoir of ﬂ uorophores that can exchange with the bleached ones , many localization events can thus be captured , enabling very high - resolution images to be collected . Localizations with low precision can be discarded , which also contributes to increased resolution . DNA - PAINT has seen many variations and innovative appli - cations 8 – 11 . A signi ﬁ cant limitation , however , is that DNA - PAINT cannot be used to visualize proteins inside live cells 12 . Although extensions of DNA - PAINT , in which the DNA is fused to a nanobody or another protein - binding module , enable intracellular proteins to be visualized , the cell must be permea - bilized to allow them to enter . As a result , work in live cells has been limited to the visualization of cell - surface proteins 12 . Here , we describe a PAINT - based method that has all the advantages of DNA - PAINT , but with the enormous bene ﬁ t that it can be used for imaging inside live cells . We refer to this approach as LIVE - PAINT ( Live cell Imaging using reVersible intEractions PAINT ) . In LIVE - PAINT , reversible peptide – protein interac - tions , rather than zipping / unzipping of a DNA oligonucleotide duplex , are responsible for the transient localizations required for SMLM . The protein to be imaged is genetically fused to a short peptide and expressed from the protein ’ s endogenous promoter . Additionally , integrated at a suitable place in the genome , a peptide - binding protein is genetically fused to a ﬂ uorescent protein and expressed from an inducible promoter , allowing its expression level to be controlled and optimized . The small size of the peptide tags fused to the protein of interest is another important strength of the method . It enables post - translational ﬂ uorescent labeling of target proteins that do not tolerate a direct fusion to a ﬂ uorescent protein . To illustrate this point , we show that LIVE - PAINT can be used to perform in vivo super - resolution imaging of proteins , such as actin and co ﬁ lin , which are notoriously refractory to direct fusions 13 , 14 . Furthermore , we show that LIVE - PAINT can be used to perform diffraction - limited tracking of individual biomolecules for extended periods of time . Results Peptide - protein pairs can be used to achieve super - resolution . The essence of LIVE - PAINT is to visualize individual ﬂ uorescent molecules transiently attached to a cellular structure of interest . The individual ﬂ uorophores are thus identi ﬁ ed by temporal , rather than spatial , separation . LIVE - PAINT achieves sparse labeling by using reversible peptide – protein interactions . The protein of interest is directly fused to a peptide and a ﬂ uorescent protein is fused to the cognate protein ( Fig . 1a ) . The peptide – protein interactions are chosen so that solution exchange occurs on a timescale shorter than or comparable to the bleaching lifetime , allowing many sequential images to be obtained . In each image , a different peptide - tagged protein of interest is bound to a different protein - FP , allowing individual proteins to be precisely localized ( Fig . 1a – d ) . These localization events are then summed to generate a super - resolution image ( Fig . 1e ) . As a test case with which to optimize this approach , we visualized the cell division septin protein Cdc12p , a component of the readily - identi ﬁ able septum that is formed during Sacchar - omyces cerevisiae budding . We tested LIVE - PAINT using two different peptide – protein interactions with very different dis - sociation constants and molecular structures : TRAP4 - MEEVF ( a tetratricopeptide repeat - peptide pair with a dissociation constant ( K D ) of 300 nM ) and SYNZIP17 - SYNZIP18 ( an antiparallel coiled coil pair with a K D of 1 nM ) 15 – 18 . In both cases , the peptide ( MEEVF or SYNZIP18 ) is fused to Cdc12p and the cognate protein or peptide ( TRAP4 or SYNZIP17 , respectively ) is fused to the bright green ﬂ uorescent protein mNeonGreen ( mNG ) 19 . Although mNG is known to blink intrinsically 20 , we chose to use it in our experiments because it is very bright and therefore can produce very precise localization events . mNG has a brightness of 93 19 , while other ﬂ uorescent proteins we use in this work , mKO and mOrange , have brightness of 31 21 and 49 22 , respectively . Most importantly , we show that mKO and mOrange , which are not known to blink intrinsically , are also compatible with LIVE - PAINT ( Supplementary Fig . 1 and Supplementary movies 1 and 2 ) . TRAP - peptide pairs have been shown previously to be less perturbative for cellular imaging than direct fusion to a ﬂ uorescent protein 23 . Both TRAP4 - MEEVF and SYNZIP17 - SYNZIP18 , were well - tolerated by the cell , and both can be used for either diffraction limited or super - resolution imaging of the septum in live yeast ( Fig . 1e ) . As with other super - resolution imaging methods , resolution improves as more localizations are acquired . In our method , we are able to obtain ~ 20 nm resolution in ~ 5 s when imaging Cdc12p - SYNZIP18 using SYNZIP17 - mNG ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We observed no distorted cell morphology or changes in growth rate in liquid media when using the TRAP4 - MEEVF and SYNZIP17 - SYNZIP18 interaction pairs . In previous work we observed distorted cell morphology for ~ 5 % of yeast expressing a ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 01188 - 6 2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | ( 2020 ) 3 : 458 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42003 - 020 - 01188 - 6 | www . nature . com / commsbio direct fusion of Cdc12p to a ﬂ uorescent protein 23 . We also provide evidence that LIVE - PAINT can be performed with additional peptide – protein interaction pairs ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , that the localizations events observed are speci ﬁ c to the protein being labeled ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , and that two orthogonal interaction pairs can be used with two ﬂ uorescent proteins to tag two different proteins speci ﬁ cally and concurrently ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Signal to background dictated by amount of labeling protein . In LIVE - PAINT , the peptide - binding proteins fused to mNG ( TRAP4 - mNG and SYNZIP17 - mNG ) , are expressed from an inducible promoter , so that expression levels can be optimized 24 . See Supplementary Fig . 6 for ﬂ uorescence induction pro ﬁ le . By varying the expression level of either TRAP4 - mNG or SYNZIP17 - mNG , for the TRAP4 - MEEVF and SYNZIP17 - SYNZIP18 interaction pairs respectively , we can determine which conditions generate the highest percentage of localizations at the septum relative to non - speci ﬁ c localizations ( Fig . 2 ) . For very low expression levels , for example for 0 % galactose with ‘ leaky ’ expression , not enough mNG is expressed and not enough localization events are achieved to generate a super - resolution image . Conversely , for example for 0 . 1 % galactose , expression levels are too high and very few individual localization events can be visualized , because the density of mNG is too high to achieve sparse labeling . At intermediate expression levels , for example with 0 . 005 % or 0 . 02 % galactose , there are suf ﬁ cient ﬂ uorescent proteins that enough localization events can be recorded to resolve a super - resolution image , but the ﬂ uorescent protein expression level is not so high that single localization events cannot be recorded . We performed cluster analysis using the DBSCAN function ( see Methods section ) to quantify the number of localization events in the septum versus in the rest of the cell . We were thus able to identify the conditions that produced the most speci ﬁ c super - resolution images . In an analogous fashion to DNA - PAINT , the ﬂ uorescent protein mNG does not give rise to a localization event until it binds and is immobilized . Some non - speci ﬁ c localization or blinking events are recorded , these are a Saccharomyces cerevisiae In vivo b Weak K D = 300 nM K D = 1 nM Strong c e d Fig . 1 LIVE - PAINT achieves sparse labeling using reversible peptide – protein interactions . a Details of the LIVE - PAINT imaging method , as applied to Cdc12p .

The number of these non - speci ﬁ c localization events increases with galactose concentration , because by increasing galactose we increase the number of free mNG which are not bound to a Cdc12p . For this reason , we choose not to work with very high galactose concentrations for most of our experiments . We observed that the highest percentage of localization events in the septum for the 0 . 005 % galactose condition when imaging both the TRAP4 - MEEVF interaction pair ( 45 % of localization events in the septum ) and the SYNZIP17 - SYNZIP18 interaction pair ( 98 % of localization events in the septum ) . The septum was identi ﬁ ed by cluster analysis ( see Methods section ) . Septum width increases as daughter to mother ratio increases . To demonstrate the potential of LIVE - PAINT , we show an example of how it can be used to study a biological structure in live cells . By analyzing SMLM data for Cdc12p in individual cells , obtained using LIVE - PAINT with the SYNZIP17 - SYNZIP18 interaction pair , we are able to describe various features of the yeast budding process . For example , we ﬁ nd that for small daughter cell sizes ( daughter : mother diameter ratio < ~ 0 . 85 ) , the septum width is of the order 200 nm . As the daughter cell gets larger ( daughter : mother diameter ratio ~ 0 . 85 – 1 . 0 ) , the septum is clearly visible as two separate rings , with a septum width of ~ 400 – 800 nm . See Supplementary Fig . 7 . This example demon - strates that LIVE - PAINT can be used to study a biological structure in live cells on the single cell level . Multiple tandem mNG improves localization precision . In current super - resolution imaging techniques used inside live cells , such as PALM , the target protein is directly fused to a ﬂ uorescent protein . This fusion adds a large modi ﬁ cation ( 25 kDa ) to the target protein . Trying to enhance the PALM signal by fusing three ﬂ uorescent proteins to the same target protein would increase the size of the overall protein by ~ 75 kDa . Many proteins are unable to fold and correctly mature to their functional state when fused to a single ﬂ uorescent protein , therefore a larger modi ﬁ cation to a target protein , on the order of 75 kDa would likely be even more detrimental . With the LIVE - PAINT method , however , the protein of interest is labeled post - translationally and reversibly . Thus , labeling with multiple tandem ﬂ uorescent proteins should be more feasible . We performed LIVE - PAINT on Cdc12p - SYNZIP18 using the SYNZIP17 fused to one or three tandem copies of mNG and compared the super - resolution data obtained for both conditions ( Supplementary Figs . 8 and 9 ) . Cdc12p not only tolerates such post - translational labeling with the three tandem mNG , but labeling with this construct results in better localization precision . We note , however , that the larger size of the three tandem mNG construct creates additional distance between the protein of interest which would result in increased uncertainty about its actual position . LIVE - PAINT enables longer data acquisition times . An addi - tional advantageous feature of the LIVE - PAINT method is that it allows bleached ﬂ uorescent labels to exchange with unbleached ﬂ uorescent labels , in vivo . In the case of STORM and PALM imaging methods , photobleaching of the probe adds a limitation to the number of emitters that can be localized . This photo - bleaching reduces the resolution of the image because it limits the density of emitters that can be measured . Thus , researchers have to resort to using localization events with lower signal to noise than is optimal . In many cases , control of the emission is dif ﬁ cult to achieve , and much of the ﬂ uorescent probe is bleached early in the acquisition when individual emitters cannot be discerned due to their density being too high , further limiting the density of localizations measured . Here we demonstrate the ability to image for longer periods of time with LIVE - PAINT , using the SYNZIP labeling pair . When imaging using a conventional direct fusion of Cdc12p to mNG , we observe that after we deliberately photobleach by irradiating with high laser power for 2 min , very few localization events are subsequently observed . In contrast , when using SYNZIP17 - SYNZIP18 to localize mNG to Cdc12p , after we deliberately photobleach by irradiating with high laser power for 2 min , we subsequently observe many more new localization events , indicating that the bleached SYNZIP17 - mNGs can unbind and be replaced by unbleached SYNZIP17 - mNGs from the cytoplasm . This result shows that the LIVE - PAINT imaging strategy allows one to obtain more total localization events during an imaging session , because they allow for longer imaging times ( Fig . 3 ) . The individual cells imaged using LIVE - PAINT for the data in Fig . 3 were measured to have a resolution of ~ 20 nm ( see Supplementary Fig . 10 for maximum projection images of the individual cells analyzed in Fig . 3 ) . Increasing exchangeable label extends data acquisition times . The data in Fig . 3 shows that reversible interaction pairs can unbind from the target protein and signal can be replenished by free protein - mNG binding to the target protein . Building on this result , we compared how long data collection can be continued , when there is a high versus low level of peptide - binding protein - mNG in the cytoplasm .

For 0 % galactose , where the expression level of peptide - binding - module - ﬂ uorescent pro - tein is low , almost all the binding - module - ﬂ uorescent protein will be initially bound to Cdc12p , thus all ﬂ uorescent proteins will be illuminated and bleached rapidly , because there is not a cytoplasmic pool of peptide - binding protein - ﬂ uorescent protein for them to exchange with . By contrast , for 0 . 1 % galactose , where the expression level of the peptide - binding protein - ﬂ uorescent protein is high , there is a sizeable cytoplasmic pool available to exchange with molecules bound to peptide - Cdc12p , but which have been bleached . In Fig . 4b , for example , we observe that when imaging Cdc12p - SYNZIP18 + SYNZIP17 - mNG using 0 . 1 % galactose , even after 200 s of imaging , localizations are still being recorded at ~ 30 – 40 % of the initial rate . a Before Bleaching Cdc12p - SYNZIP18 + SYNZIP17 - mNG Cdc12p - mNG b After Bleaching Before Bleaching After Bleaching Frames 1 - 200 201 - 400 401 - 600 601 - 800 801 - 1000 Frames 1 - 200 201 - 400 401 - 600 601 - 800 801 - 1000 DF PrB DF PoB SZ PrB SZ PoB 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 N u m be r o f l o c a li z a t i on s Fig . 3 LIVE - PAINT shows recovery of signal after bleaching . a LIVE - PAINT interaction pairs show more recovery in number of localization events than a direct fusion to a ﬂ uorescent protein .

Actin ( Act1p ) , an important cytoskeletal protein , is notoriously dif ﬁ cult to tag and image . A number of different methods have been developed to circumvent this problem , but they are not without issues , including changing the stability , dynamics , and lifetime of Act1p structures 13 , 25 , 26 . Direct fusion of Act1p to the photoconvertible ﬂ uorescent protein mEos , expressed alongside unmodi ﬁ ed Act1p , has been used to image Act1p using PALM 27 , 28 . The mEos protein is a rather large addition to Act1p , and undoubtedly results in some perturbation of function ( as evidenced by cells expressing only Act1p - mEos , in the absence of any unmodi ﬁ ed Act1p , being unviable ) . LifeAct is a peptide that binds to the polymerized form of Act1p , and not the unpoly - merized form . The perturbation to the equilibrium distribution of Act1p forms that LifeAct causes has been noted 25 . Nevertheless , the binding and unbinding of LifeAct has been used to image Act1p ﬁ laments in live cells using a PAINT - like approach 29 . We note and reference this result , however polymerized Act1p is the only protein that can be imaged using LifeAct , our method can be applied to any protein , including Act1p , and we present its application to Act1p to provide another possible tool for actin researchers . Wild - type Act1p was chromosomally expressed from its endogenous promoter . We expressed SYNZIP18 - Act1p from a low copy number plasmid , using a copper - inducible promoter . SYNZIP17 - mNG was expressed , as previously , from the galactose inducible promoter , chromosomally integrated at the GAL2 locus ( Fig . 5 ) . Using LIVE - PAINT , we were able to readily visualize actin patches , which assemble at the cell membrane , at sites of endocytosis 30 ( Fig . 5a ) . Because actin structures are quite dynamic , we investigated how quickly we could obtain super - resolution images ( compared to the acquisition time of 200 s for the data shown in Fig . 5c ) . Actin rings , or actin cables that span the cell , are likely not observed because we are imaging in TIRF , which illuminates only ~ 200 nm into the cell ( a typical yeast cell is 1 – 3 μ m thick ) . Alternatively , or additionally , it could be that the stringent structural requirements for actin in these assemblies means that even actin with very small ~ 2 kDa tags may be excluded from ring and cable structures 31 . LIVE - PAINT enables long tracking times in vivo . In the data presented so far , we have used LIVE - PAINT to generate super - resolution images of proteins which do not move signi ﬁ cantly during the period of data acquisition . In some cases , the protein - of - interest may move on the timescale of imaging , and whilst an increase in the imaging frame rate could resolve this to some extent , it may not always be possible if the proteins move too quickly . The extended imaging lifetime enabled by LIVE - PAINT , however , offers the opportunity to detect and track the motion of diffusing molecules within live cells . Co ﬁ lin ( Cof1p ) is an important protein that binds to actin ﬁ laments promoting severing 14 . It has so far , however , proven dif ﬁ cult to image due to its function being affected by either N - or C - terminal direct fusion of a ﬂ uorescent protein 14 . We therefore C - terminally tagged Cof1p with SYNZIP18 , and tracked it using the LIVE - PAINT strategy ( diffraction - limited , not super - resolution ) . We were able to observe the diffusion of Cof1p during the 100 s of imaging ( Fig . 6 and Supplementary movie 3 ) . We observed a wide range of behaviors ( Fig . 6 ) . The success of the LIVE - PAINT tagging approach in these examples demonstrates the value of the method for visualizing proteins that are refractory to direct fusion to a ﬂ uorescent protein 14 , and also its potential to be developed to track moving proteins . Discussion We have developed an imaging strategy , LIVE - PAINT , which enables a new approach to super - resolution imaging inside live cells . We have demonstrated the effectiveness of LIVE - PAINT , which makes use of reversible protein – peptide interactions to obtain SMLM in live S . cerevisiae . The data we obtained for Cdc12p enabled us , for example , to quantitatively track the width of the septum at the bud neck of budding yeast as a function of daughter : mother cell diameter ratio and showed that septum width does not change signi ﬁ cantly until the daughter diameter reaches ~ 0 . 85 of the mother cell diameter , at which point the septum divides into two distinct rings . LIVE - PAINT has a number of advantages over existing super - resolution imaging methods . The main advantage over DNA - PAINT is that LIVE - PAINT works inside living cells ; all the components that we describe are chosen to function in that milieu . Also , LIVE - PAINT is extendible to concurrent tagging of multiple proteins . Recently , interacting charged coiled coil pairs have been used to label proteins to perform PALM imaging in live mammalian cells 32 . This work provides a valuable independent validation of our approach . LIVE - PAINT requires neither photo - conversion of ﬂ uor - ophores ( as PALM does ) nor selective deactivation of ﬂ uor - ophores as stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) does . Not only do these methods require special instrumentation , but the high laser power that is typically required can often cause cell damage during live cell imaging experiments , in addition to bleaching of ﬂ uorophores 33 . LIVE - PAINT is performed inside living cells , typically in minimal growth medium , with no potentially toxic additions , such as oxygen scavengers , required . LIVE - PAINT requires only that the protein of interest is directly fused to a small peptide tag , a strategy with a number of advantages . Labeling is post - translational , and therefore the method is sui - table for labeling proteins for which direct fusion to a larger ﬂ uorescent protein abrogates function 23 . Other approaches to performing PAINT in live cells , such as protein - PAINT , require the addition of organic dyes , cannot be used to image multiple targets simultaneously , and require a larger fusion to the target protein 34 . The intensity of the signal from each localization event can be increased , by using a tandem array of ﬂ uorescent proteins attached to the peptide - binding protein . It is also straightforward to change the identity of the ﬂ uorescent protein , without needing b a c Fig . 5 Actin patches can be imaged using LIVE - PAINT in live yeast . a Cartoon showing the three distinctive actin structures that have been observed in ﬁ xed and immunostained S cerevisiae : actin cables ( red ) , actin rings ( blue ) , and actin patches ( magenta ) . b Diffraction limited image of SYNZIP18 - Act1p + SYNZIP17 - mNG . c LIVE - PAINT super - resolution image constructed from 200 s video imaging SYNZIP18 - Act1p + SYNZIP17 - mNG ( 50 ms exposure per frame and a laser power density of 3 . 1 W / cm 2 ) .

Because LIVE - PAINT does not rely on the use of photoactivatable pro - teins , any ﬂ uorescent protein can be used . This ﬂ exibility in choice of ﬂ uorescent protein means that the method could be extended to concurrent super - resolution imaging of multiple targets . One of the limitations of existing live cell super - resolution methods is the reliance on ﬂ uorescent proteins that are all very spectrally similar to one another , which prevents accurate ima - ging of multiple target proteins concurrently . Even though recent methods have been extended to image two targets in live cells , they require harsh oxygen scavengers and are limited to only two colors by the lack of additional orthogonal chemistries for attachment of dyes to protein tags such as SNAP - tag 35 . LIVE - PAINT does not require oxygen scavengers and is limited only by the number of orthogonal peptide – protein interaction pairs and the number of available spectrally distinct ﬂ uorescent proteins , both of which are abundant . Importantly , the protein of interest is expressed from its endogenous promoter and the conditions for detection of ﬂ uor - escence localizations are optimized by adjusting the intracellular concentration of the peptide - binding protein - ﬂ uorescent protein that is used for labeling . This means that for a very abundant protein of interest , for example , in LIVE - PAINT the number of ﬂ uorescent proteins can be reduced by reducing the expression level of the peptide - binding protein - ﬂ uorescent protein , instead of having to photobleach some of the ﬂ uorescent proteins to reduce the number so that individual ﬂ uorescent proteins can be localized . Similarly , for a low abundance protein of interest directly fused to a ﬂ uorescent protein , photobleaching is espe - cially problematic , because the starting number of molecules is very low . In LIVE - PAINT , more localization events can be observed by imaging for longer , during which time any bleached peptide - binding protein - ﬂ uorescent proteins can be refreshed by exchange with an unbleached pool . Finally , LIVE - PAINT , especially in a TIRFM ( or light - sheet ﬂ uorescence microscopy ) format , enables data to be acquired for much longer than other current methods ( such as PALM ) that can be used inside live cells . In such methods , the ﬂ uorescent protein is directly fused to the protein of interest , so once a ﬂ uorophore is bleached , it is not replaced and from then onwards is dark . By contrast , in LIVE - PAINT , the non - covalently bound ﬂ uorescent protein can be exchanged after bleaching , with a non - bleached ﬂ uorescent protein from the cytoplasm . Acquiring data for longer results in more localizations being detected and con - sequently higher resolution images being obtained . Unbound ﬂ uorescent proteins in LIVE - PAINT result in background ﬂ uorescence , but this effect can be mitigated by reducing the illumination volume in the cell , as we have done using TIRFM in this work , or by using other strategies , such as light - sheet ﬂ uor - escence microscopy . We have demonstrated the power of LIVE - PAINT in S . cere - visiae by using it to image Cdc12p and hence to study septum formation . Furthermore , we have used it to image Act1p and Cof1p , two important proteins that are intractable to direct fusion . Finally , we showed that this approach is fundamentally compatible with tracking the movement of individual proteins inside live cells . We expect that it will be straightforward to extend LIVE - PAINT to other organisms and cell types . In our work we found that two of the three peptide - pairs that we tested were suitable for LIVE - PAINT . Many more potentially compatible interaction pairs exist , and may be better suited for particular applications . In future work , we will investigate how the optimal labeling requirements differ for different cellular proteins and how best to label and image multiple proteins simultaneously . Methods Molecular biology . All cloning was performed in Escherichia coli strain TOP10 . Peptide tags were cloned into pFA6a - KANMX6 by amplifying the plasmid back - bone and inserting gBlocks ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) using NEBuilder ® HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix ( New England Biolabs ) .

The 3xmNG construct itself was joined to SYNZIP17 using our standard GGSGSGLQ linker . Peptide - binding proteins fused to ﬂ uorescent proteins were cloned into the pFA6a - HIS3MX6 and tagged Act1p constructs were cloned into the pCu415CUP1 vector ( CEN6 / ARS4 origin of replication ) using the methods referenced above . The linker used to fuse Act1p to SYNZIP18 or MEEVF was GGSGSG . Primer sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Tables 2 , 3 , and 4 . Peptide – protein interaction selection . TRAP4 - MEEVF 15 , SYNZIP17 - SYNZIP18 17 , and CC - A N 3 . 5 - CC - B N 3 . 536 interaction pairs were identi ﬁ ed in the literature and tested in vivo in live yeast by fusing one half of the interaction pair to a protein of interest and the other half to a ﬂ uorescent protein . The cells were imaged under a microscope as described in the “ Microscopy ” section . The TRAP4 - MEEVF and SYNZIP17 - SYNZIP18 interaction pairs showed no morphological abnormalities , no noticeable growth defect in liquid culture or on plates , and showed ﬂ uorescence at the expected locus of the tagged protein . For this reason , these two interaction pairs were used in this work . Using CC - A N 3 . 5 - CC - B N 3 . 5 interaction pair resulted in unusual cell morphology in the vast majority of cells , with elongated cell shapes , so this pair was not used further . The 101A - 101B and 108A - 108B interaction pairs 18 were also checked and did not cause any changes to cell morphology or changes to cell growth . Yeast strain construction . Except where otherwise noted , standard methods for genetically modifying yeast and preparing growth media were used 37 . These methods are described below . The yeast strains and selection markers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 5 . Yeast strains constructed in this study are all derived from the parent strain BY4741 . C - terminal tags were ampli ﬁ ed from pFA6a - kanMX6 yeast integration vectors , along with the KanR marker . The ampli ﬁ cation primers also included 45bp homology arms , which matched the ﬁ nal 45 bp preceding the stop codon in the protein to be tagged and 45bp downstream of the stop codon . Transformants were selected by plating ﬁ rst on YPD plates and then replica plating to yeast agar plates including 600mg / L geneticin ( Gibco ) and incubating for a further 48 h . Fluorescent protein fusions were inserted into the yeast genome at the GAL2 locus by amplifying the desired protein ’ s sequence from a plasmid . The ampli ﬁ cation primers also included 45 bp homology arms that match sequences upstream and downstream of the GAL2 gene , and the HIS3 gene . Transformants were selected by plating on synthetic complete agar plates lacking histidine . Strain construction was veri ﬁ ed by PCR ampli ﬁ cation of the modi ﬁ ed locus ( using primers from Supplementary Table 2 ) . First , genomic DNA ( gDNA ) was isolated from colonies obtained from yeast transformations . This was done by resuspending a single yeast colony in 100 μ L of 0 . 2M LiAc + 1 % SDS . This mixture was incubated at 75 °C in a heat block for 5 min . Afterwards , 300 μ L 100 % ethanol was added to the mixture and centrifuged at 15 , 000 × g for 3min . The resulting pellet was washed with 100 μ L 70 % ethanol , the ethanol was removed , and the pellet allowed to dry for 10min . The dried pellet was then dissolved in 20 μ L TE buffer ( 10mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 ) and centrifuged at 15 , 000 × g for 15s . The supernatant containing the gDNA was then transferred to a fresh tube . This gDNA was then used as a template for a PCR reaction to con ﬁ rm the presence of the inserted DNA at the genomic locus being checked . The PCR reactions were carried out using Phusion High - Fidelity DNA Polymerase and GC buffer ( New England Biolabs ) in a ProFlex PCR system ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . All PCR reactions to validate the insertion of DNA at genomic loci ran for 30 cycles and used an extension time of 2min and a volume of 10 μ L . The annealing temperatures used for checking each locus varied : CDC12 ( 59 °C ) , GAL2 ( 64 °C ) , and COF1 ( 61 °C ) . PCR products were run on a 1 % agarose gel in TAE buffer ( 40 mM Tris , 20 mM acetic acid , and 1mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 ) for 30 min at 120 V . Microscopy . For imaging experiments , yeast cells were grown overnight in 500 μ L of synthetic complete media . Constructs using the GAL1 promoter were all grown with 1 % w / v raf ﬁ nose plus the concentration of galactose desired for a particular experiment . The concentration of galactose used varied between 0 % and 2 % w / v . One colony was picked into a 500 μ L overnight culture to ensure that the OD 600 of the cells was between 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 by the time of imaging . Two dilutions of the overnight culture , 1 : 1 and 1 : 5 , were prepared to ensure that one would fall in this OD 600 range . In all , 22 ×22 mm glass coverslips with thickness no . 1 ( VWR ) were cleaned by a 20 min exposure in a 2 . 6 L Zepto plasma laboratory unit ( Diener Electronic ) . Frame - Seal slide chambers ( 9× 9mm 2 , Biorad , Hercules , CA ) were then secured to a coverslip . The surface was prepared for the attachment of yeast cells by coating the surface with 2mg / mL concanavalin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , which was dissolved in PBS pH 7 . 4 , using ~ 100 μ L per well . After leaving the concanavalin A on the surface of the slide for 30s , it was removed using a pipette tip and by tilting the slide to ensure all liquid was removed . Then , 150 μ L of prepared yeast culture was pipetted onto the slide . The yeast culture was left to sit on the slide for ~ 5 min . The cells were then aspirated from the slide , the surface washed with milliQ water three times , and then 150 μ L fresh milliQ water was then added to the slide before imaging . Single - molecule imaging was performed using a custom - built TIRF microscope , which restricts the illumination to within 200 nm of the sample slide . ImageJ was used to collect images and videos . The ﬂ uorophores were excited with 488 nm illumination . Collimated laser light at a wavelength of 488 nm ( Cobolt MLD 488 - 200 Diode Laser System , Cobalt , Sweden ) was aligned and directed parallel to the optical axis at the edge of a 1 . 49 NA TIRF objective ( CFI Apochromat TIRF 60XC Oil , Nikon , Japan ) , mounted on an inverted Nikon TI2 microscope ( Nikon , Japan ) . The microscope was ﬁ tted with a perfect focus system to autocorrect the z - stage drift during imaging . Fluorescence collected by the same objective was separated from the returning TIR beam by a dichroic mirror ( Di01 - R405 / 488 / 561 / 635 ( Semrock , Rochester , NY , USA ) ) , and was passed through appropriate ﬁ lters ( BLP01 - 488R , FF01 - 520 / 44 ( Semrock , NY , USA ) ) . The ﬂ uorescence was then passed through a 2 . 5× beam expander and recorded on an EMCCD camera ( Delta Evolve 512 , Photometrics , Tucson , AZ , USA ) operating in frame transfer mode ( EMGain = 11 . 5e – / ADU and 250 ADU / photon ) . Each pixel was 103 nm in length . Images were recorded with an exposure time of 50ms with a laser power density of 3 . 1 W / cm 2 . The lasers were ﬁ rst attenuated with neutral density ﬁ lters to reduce the excitation power . The power at the back aperture of the objective lens was measured , and the excitation area determined using tetraspeck beads immobilized on a glass coverslip . The microscope was automated using the open source microscopy platform Micromanager . For photobleach - and - recovery experiments we ﬁ rst imaged the samples at very high laser power density ( 26 . 6 W / cm 2 ) . After 1000 frames ( 50 s ) of imaging , this power density was dropped to 3 . 1W / cm 2 . The sample was then imaged for another 1000 frames ( 50 s ) . For experiments in which mKO and mOrange were used for imaging , a 561 nm laser ( Cobolt DPL Series 561 - 100 DPSS Laser System , Cobalt , Sweden ) was used just as the 488 nm laser was used for mNG imaging experiments . The laser power used was 50W / cm 2 when imaging mKO or mOrange . Microscope settings / imaging parameters . Images were analyzed using Fiji ( Java 8 2017 release ) and single localizations were processed using the Peak Fit function of the Fiji GDSC SMLM plugin , using a signal strength threshold of 30 , a minimum photon threshold of 100 , and a precision threshold of 20 nm . The precision threshold was sometimes changed to 30nm , 40 nm , or 1000 nm , in order to obtain the distribution of precision values for all obtained localization events . Supple - mentary Figure 12 shows a matrix of precision and minimum photons per loca - lization thresholds applied to one stack of images , which helped select the cutoffs used . Image resolution calculation . Image resolution was calculated by ﬁ rst performing cluster analysis using DBSCAN 38 in Python 2 . 7 to identify localizations in the yeast bud neck . Then , resolution was measured using the equation R eff ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ (cid:1) r nn ð Þ 2 þ (cid:1) σ ð Þ 2 q , where R eff is the effective image resolution , (cid:1) r nn is the mean nearest neighbor distance between localizations in the septum , and (cid:1) σ is the average localization precision 39 . Cluster analysis for identifying yeast septum . For the images shown in Fig . 2 , septum localizations were identi ﬁ ed from total cellular localization events using DBSCAN 38 in Python 2 . 7 and the percent of total cellular localizations in the septum was determined . In order to prevent misidenti ﬁ cation of septa in back - ground localizations , DBSCAN was applied to localizations within a 1 - μ m radius of the center of the cell . DBSCAN parameters were maintained for images of cells the same galactose concentration : 0 % galactose – ε = 2 , N = 25 ; 0 . 005 % galactose – ε = 2 , N = 50 ; 0 . 02 % galactose – ε = 1 . 75 , N = 50 ; and 0 . 1 % galactose – ε = 2 . 8 , N = 75 . Quantifying septum width . Budding yeast with septa were identi ﬁ ed from z - projections and following thresholding , ImageJ ’ s Analyze Particles tool was used to determine : the maximum Feret ’ s diameter of the cell , the starting coordinates of the Feret ’ s diameter , the angle between the Feret ’ s diameter and the x - axis , and the coordinates of the cellular center of mass . The end coordinates of the Feret ’ s diameter were calculated from the Feret ’ s diameter data . In the same cells , septum localizations were identi ﬁ ed from total cellular localization events as described in above cluster analysis within a radius of the Feret ’ s diameter / 5 from the cell ’ s center of mass and using parameters of ε = 2 , N = 100 . The distance between the center of the septum points and the coordinates of both the start and end of the Feret ’ s diameter was determined and the larger of the two was taken to be the mother cell diameter and the smaller , the daughter cell diameter . To ﬁ nd the septum width , the mean absolute perpendicular distance between all the septum localizations and the line bisecting the angle between the center of the septum , and the mother and daughter diameters was doubled .

Plate reader measurements were carried out on a POLARstar Omega microplate reader ( BMG LABTECH ) . To observe the galactose - dependent induction of mNG under the GAL1 promoter in a gal2 Δ background , budding yeast cells were grown overnight in 500 μ L of synthetic complete media plus 1 % w / v raf ﬁ nose and galactose concentrations ranging from 0 to 0 . 1 % w / v . The next morning , 200 μ L of this culture was added to individual wells in a 96 - well clear bottom plate ( Greiner bio - one , item 655096 ) . Cellular ﬂ uorescence was excited using the 485 nm excitation ﬁ lter and measured using the 520 nm emission ﬁ lter . The optical density of the cells was measured using the absorbance setting at 600 nm . The ﬂ uorescence readings were then normalized to the number of cells by dividing the measured cellular ﬂ uorescence by the optical density . Single - molecule tracking analysis . The LIVE - PAINT images were recorded at a frame rate of 50 ms for 2000 frames . The images were ﬁ rst analyzed using Trackpy 40 . Individual puncta corresponding to Cof1p clusters were selected by applying a mask size of 7 and a minimum mass of 2000 . The puncta were linked into tracks by applying a maximum displacement of three pixels / frame , and a memory of three frames ( i . e . if the puncta were absent in more than 3 frames , then they were no longer linked to those in previous or subsequent frames ) . Tracks shorter than 20 frames were discarded , and the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) plot for the remaining tracks were calculated . Igor Pro ( Wavemetrics ) was used to calculate the initial diffusion coef ﬁ cient for each track by ﬁ tting the ﬁ rst 250 ms of the MSD to a straight line and determining the gradient . The log of the diffusion coef ﬁ cients determined from ﬁ ts with an r 2 > 0 . 5 were then used to populate the diffusion coef ﬁ cient histogram . A custom code was also used to generate the tracking movies , and the track ﬁ gure ( Fig . 6B ) . Statistics and reproducibility . A one - tailed t - test was performed to compare whether the mean precision values differed between 1xmNG and 3xmNG imaging experiments . First , the mean precision value of all localization events was calcu - lated . Using two replicates ( super - resolution images from different ﬁ elds of view ) for each of 1xmNG and 3xmNG experiments , a t - test was then performed using the t - test function in MATLAB ( 2019b release ) .
