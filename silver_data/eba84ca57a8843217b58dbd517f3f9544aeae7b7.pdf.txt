Teleman & Constantinos Demetriades mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) regulates cell growth and metabolism . mTORC1 activity is regulated via integration of positive growth - promoting stimuli and negative stress stimuli . One stress cells confront in physiological and pathophysiological contexts is hyperosmotic stress . The mechanism by which hyperosmotic stress regulates mTORC1 activity is not well understood . We show here that mild hyperosmotic stress induces a rapid and reversible inactivation of mTORC1 via a mechanism involving multiple upstream signaling pathways . We find that hyperosmotic stress causes dynamic changes in TSC2 phosphorylation by upstream kinases , such as Akt , thereby recruiting TSC2 from the cytoplasm to lysosomes where it acts on Rheb , the direct activator of mTORC1 . This work puts together a signaling pathway whereby hyperosmotic stress inactivates mTORC1 . The mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR , formerly known as mammalian target of rapamycin ) senses the nutritional status of the cell and is a master regulator of growth and metabolism 1 , 2 . mTOR is a serine / threonine protein kinase that is highly conserved from yeast to mammals and belongs to the phosphati - dylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) - related kinase family ( PIKK ) 3 . mTOR is present in two distinct molecu - lar complexes , mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) and mTOR complex 2 ( mTORC2 ) , which show different subunit composition , functions , upstream regulation , and sensitivity to the allosteric mTOR inhibitor rapamycin 2 , 4 . mTORC1 integrates various upstream signals—such as growth factors , nutrients , energy levels , oxygen and stresses—to regulate protein , lipid and nucleic acid synthesis , ribosomal biogenesis , glucose uptake , glycolysis , NADPH production and autophagy , thereby controlling cellular metabolism and growth 1 , 2 . Dysregulation of mTOR is implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases such as cancer , and metabolic disorders 1 , 2 , 5 . One stress to which cells are exposed under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions is hyperosmotic stress . Cells within the kidney ( renal inner medula ) , the gastrointestinal tract , the cornea , the liver , intervertebral discs and joints are exposed to substantial osmolarity fluctuations even under physiological conditions ( reviewed in 6 ) . In addition , dietary and ambient conditions can also induce hypernatremia in sites such as the respiratory epithelium and the skin , resulting in approximate hyper - osmolalities of 400 mOsm / kg 7 – 9 . Hyperosmotic stress acts as an inflammatory stimulus and is implicated in various pathophysiological conditions . Examples are inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract , liver disease , cardiovascular disease and the dry eye syndrome ( reviewed in 6 ) . Moreover , increased plasma tonicity ( in conditions of serum hyperglycemia and hypernatremia / hyperkalemia ) is suggested to induce an elevation of blood pressure and the progression of diabetes , promoting insulin resistance , diabetic cataract formation , and diabetic nephropathy ( renal tubular fibrosis ) ( reviewed in 6 ) . Finally , epithelial cells exposed to sublytic concentrations of bacterial pore - forming toxins can face osmotic stress 10 . Hyperosmotic stress causes cells to shrink , thereby increasing the density of all intracellular macromolecules . Since cells are sensitive to such alterations , they have developed mechanisms to quickly compensate for osmostress by regulating their volume ( reviewed in 11 ) . If cells fail to compensate for osmostress , they trigger apoptosis and die 12 – 14 .

Previous reports investigating the effect of hyperosmotic stress on mTORC1 came to differing conclu - sions . Most of them found that osmostress inactivates mTORC1 ( as depicted by phosphorylation of its downstream substrates S6 kinase and 4E - BP1 ) 15 – 19 , others reported that mTORC1 activity is not signifi - cantly affected 20 and others that mTORC1 activity increases in response to hyperosmotic conditions 21 – 23 . Therefore , how mTORC1 regulation is involved in the hyperosmotic stress response is not clear . The upstream mechanisms mediating the effects of hyperosmotic stress on mTORC1 are also partially con - flicting and incompletely understood 16 – 19 , 22 – 26 . Importantly , in yeast , TOR is necessary to promote cell survival upon salt stress 27 , 28 , highlighting the significance of mTOR signaling in the osmoregulatory response in eukaryotes . The closest upstream direct activator of mTORC1 is the small GTPase Ras homolog enriched in brain ( Rheb ) . mTORC1 binding to active GTP - bound Rheb is essential for mTORC1 activation 29 , 30 . Rheb is localized on lysosomal and endosomal membranes and possibly other endomembranes as well 31 – 35 . Thus mTORC1 activation requires both activation of Rheb as well as mTORC1 recruitment to Rheb - containing compartments 34 . Rheb activity is controlled by the tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) consisting of tuber - ous sclerosis complex 1 ( TSC1 , also known as hamartin ) , tuberous sclerosis complex 2 ( TSC2 , also known as tuberin ) and TBC1D7 36 . TSC2 has a GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) domain and catalyzes conversion of active GTP - bound Rheb to its inactive GDP - bound form to inhibit mTORC1 29 , 30 . The TSC complex appears to be a central integration point for multiple stress signals to inactivate mTORC1 37 . We previously showed that amino acid removal inactivates mTORC1 in part by recruiting TSC2 to the lysosome , where it acts on Rheb to fully release and inhibit mTORC1 38 . mTORC1 - dependent , TOP mRNA translation was also shown to be inhibited via TSC2 in response to amino acid starva - tion 39 . Similarly , growth factor signaling to mTORC1 also involves changes in TSC2 localization 40 , 41 . Furthermore , stresses such as low energy or hypoxia were also described to signal via multiple mech - anisms to the TSC complex to inhibit mTORC1 42 – 44 . Therefore , most upstream inputs that regulate mTORC1 follow diverse pathways but integrate on the TSC complex to control its activity . Whether regulation of TSC2 subcellular localization represents a general mechanism to control its function is an important question that has not been answered yet . Here we show that mild hyperosmotic stress is capable of inactivating mTORC1 in a rapid and revers - ible manner . In response to activation of a calyculin - A - sensitive upstream phosphatase , osmostress leads to inhibition of Akt , thereby relocalizing TSC2 to the lysosome to act on Rheb , and therefore inhibit mTORC1 . This work pieces together a pathway that leads to mTORC1 inhibition in response to hyper - osmotic stress . Results Hyperosmotic stress rapidly and reversibly inactivates mTORC1 in multiple cell lines . To study the mechanism by which hyperosmotic stress ( henceforth referred to as osmostress ) inhibits mTORC1 , we treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) with medium supplemented with increasing amounts of sodium chloride ( NaCl ) , ranging from 25 mM to 150 mM . The osmolality of normal medium is roughly 330 mOsm / kg so that addition of 100 mM NaCl corresponds to a physiological increase to approximately 500 mOsm / kg 20 . In agreement with previous reports showing mTORC1 inactivation upon osmostress 15 – 19 , mTORC1 activity progressively decreases as the medium becomes more hypertonic , with 100 mM of NaCl causing nearly complete mTORC1 inactivation ( Fig . 1A ) . This effect was due to a change in medium osmolality , and not specific for sodium chloride , since it was recapitulated by addition of the non - ionic osmolyte sorbitol ( Fig . 1B ) . Furthermore , inactivation of mTORC1 appears to be a fairly canonical response of cells to osmostress , since we also observed it in a panel of cell lines of different origins ( Supplementary Fig . S1A – C ) . mTORC1 inhibition occurs very rapidly in response to osmostress , reaching maximal inhibition 15 minutes after treatment and mildly recovering at later time points ( Fig . 1C ) . Although we do not know the reason for the mild recovery in mTORC1 activity at later time points , mammalian cells are known to rapidly activate ion transport systems to compensate for altered medium osmolarity 45 . The mTORC1 inhibition is rapidly reversed upon returning cells to normal medium ( Fig . 1D ) . For all subsequent treatments , we used osmostress conditions ( + 100 mM NaCl ) that induce a robust effect on mTORC1 , but are mild enough that cells survive it , based on reversibility of the effect . Osmostress causes lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 . We previously reported that the mTORC1 inhibitor TSC2 rapidly accumulates on lysosomes when cells are treated with medium lacking amino acids ( nutrient stress ) 38 . Likewise , TSC2 relocalizes to lysosomal membranes when cells are deprived of growth factor signaling 40 , 41 . Hence , we asked whether TSC2 also relocalizes to lysosomes in response to osmostress . Indeed , treating cells with hypertonic medium caused a rapid accumulation of TSC2 to lysosomes ( marked by LAMP2 ) , regardless of whether the hypertonicity of the medium was caused by addition of NaCl ( Fig . 2A ) or sorbitol ( Fig . 2B ) . Whereas TSC2 localization is uniformly cytoplasmic in MEFs treated with control medium ( Fig . 2A , top row ) , clear lysosomal accumulations of TSC2 could be observed as early as 5 minutes after induction of osmostress ( Fig . 2A , second row ) . Similar to the www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 13828 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep13828 reversibility of mTORC1 activity , the lysosomal localization of TSC2 was rapidly reversed , going back to a uniform cytoplasmic distribution within 5 minutes of returning cells to isotonic medium ( Fig . 2C ) . The TSC complex is required for proper inactivation of mTORC1 in response to osmos - tress . To test the requirement for TSC2 in the response of mTORC1 to osmostress , we treated control and TSC2 knock - out MEFs with hypertonic medium . Whereas control cells rapidly inactivate mTORC1 within minutes of osmostress induction , TSC2 - null MEFs retain significant amounts of mTORC1 activity ( Fig . 3A ) . More extended treatments with hypertonic medium led to complete mTORC1 inactivation also in TSC2 - null MEFs ( Supplementary Fig . S2A ) , indicating that TSC2 is required for the initial inac - tivation of mTORC1 in response to osmostress , whereas a TSC2 - independent mechanism inactivates mTORC1 at later time points . In this report , we focus on the initial mTORC1 inactivation that occurs within the first 5 – 15 minutes of osmostress that is TSC2 - dependent . As expected , delayed inactivation of mTORC1 in response to osmostress was also observed in MEFs lacking the TSC2 binding partner TSC1 ( Supplementary Fig . S2B ) . Figure 1 . Hyperosmotic stress inactivates mTORC1 in a rapid and reversible manner . ( A , B ) Hyperosmotic stress inactivates mTORC1 in a dose - dependent manner . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were exposed to normal or hyperosmotic culture media . Medium osmolality was increased by adding NaCl for 15 min ( A ) or sorbitol for 60 min ( B ) . Lower panels show quantifications of phospho - S6K normalized to total S6K , or phospho - 4E - BP1 normalized to total 4E - BP1 .

Lower panels show quantifications of phospho - S6K normalized to total S6K , or phospho - 4E - BP1 normalized to total 4E - BP1 . ( D ) mTORC1 inhibition by hyperosmotic stress is reversible . MEFs were treated with hyperosmotic medium ( + 100 mM NaCl ) for 1h after which the stress was reversed by replacing with normal culture medium for the indicated time points . See also Supplementary Fig . S1 . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 4 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 13828 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep13828 mTORC1 activity is regulated via a combination of two factors—its subcellular localization and the state of activation of its binding partner Rheb 34 . Hence , we asked whether osmostress causes displace - ment of mTORC1 away from lysosomes , but this was not the case . Whereas mTORC1 becomes cyto - plasmic in cells deprived of amino acids ( “ - aa” , Fig . 3B ) , it was still lysosomally concentrated in cells treated with hypertonic medium ( “NaCl” , Fig . 3B ) . This suggests osmostress does not regulate mTORC1 via its subcellular localization , but rather via the state of Rheb activation . Indeed , forcing mTORC1 to localize to Rheb - containing endomembranes , by expressing a Raptor - Rheb chimera does not pre - vent mTORC1 inactivation in response to osmostress ( Fig . 3C ) . As a control , the Raptor - Rheb chimera rescues mTORC1 inactivation upon amino acid starvation ( “ - aa” in Fig . 3C ) , as previously reported 34 . Consistent with osmostress regulating Rheb activation rather than mTORC1 localization , expression of a constitutively active Rheb that cannot be acted upon by TSC2 46 partially rescues mTORC1 activity in response to osmostress ( lanes 3 – 4 , Fig . 3D ) , whereas expression of wild - type Rheb is less potent ( lanes 5 – 6 , Fig . 3D ) . Consistent with the existence of a TSC2 / Rheb - independent mechanism that inactivates mTORC1 at later time points , overexpression of constitutively active Rheb was not sufficient to prevent mTORC1 inhibition by prolonged osmostress ( Supplementary Fig . S2C ) . Osmostress regulates multiple signaling pathways impinging upon TSC2 . The TSC1 / 2 com - plex is a central integration point for the regulation of mTORC1 in response to upstream stimuli 37 , 38 . Phosphorylation of the TSC1 / 2 complex is regulated by multiple signaling pathways including Akt , Erk , AMPK , RSK , GSK3 β and p38 / MAPKAPK2 37 , 47 , many of which have been previously reported to be affected by osmostress 11 , 26 . We analyzed which of these pathways are modulated in our experimental Figure 2 . Hyperosmotic stress causes a rapid and reversible recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes .

Treatment of MEFs with hypertonic medium leads to a transient decrease in phosphorylation of Akt on both the PDK1 ( Thr308 ) and mTORC2 ( Ser473 ) sites ( Fig . 4A and Supplementary Fig . S1A – C ) , in agreement with two previous reports 16 , 24 . The drop in Akt phosphorylation leads to a decrease in its activity , as reflected by the dephosphorylation of its canonical target GSK3 β ( Supplementary Fig . S3A ) and a corresponding drop in phosphorylation of TSC2 on the Akt site ( Thr1462 ) ( Fig . 4A , and Supplementary Fig . S1B - C and S3A ) . Osmostress also causes a transient drop in Erk phosphorylation Figure 3 . TSC2 and Rheb mediate mTORC1 inactivation upon hyperosmotic stress . ( A ) TSC2 - null MEFs do not appropriately inactivate mTORC1 upon acute hyperosmotic stress .

MEFs were treated with hyperosmotic medium ( + 100 mM NaCl ) or medium lacking amino acids ( - aa ) for 1 h and mTOR localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy .

Representative magnified insets are shown on the right . ( C ) Hyperosmotic stress inhibits mTORC1 independently of its localization . mTORC1 in HEK293FT cells was targeted to Rheb - containing endomembranes by overexpression of chimeric Raptor - Rheb15 , as previously described 34 . mTORC1 activity was analyzed for non - treated cells ( Ctrl ) , cells treated for 15 min with hyperosmotic medium ( + 100 mM NaCl ) or 1 h with medium lacking amino acids ( - aa ) .

( E ) Inhibition of p38MAPK does not prevent mTORC1 inactivation in response to hyperosmotic stress . MEFs were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of p38 inhibitor SB203580 and then exposed to hyperosmotic stress for the indicated times . See also Supplementary Fig . S3 . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 7 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 13828 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep13828 ( Fig . 4A and Supplementary Fig . S3B ) and in phosphorylation of TSC2 on Ser664 , the Erk site 48 , 49 ( Fig . 4A ) . In contrast with the transient regulation of the other kinases , p38 phosphorylation increases steadily in response to osmostress ( Fig . 4A ) . The phosphorylation of several other kinases tested was unaffected by osmostress ( Supplementary Fig . S3B - B ′ ) . In sum , osmostress modulates activity of various signaling pathways that impinge on TSC2 ( summarized in Fig . 4A ′ ) . Lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 is mainly mediated via modulation of Akt signaling . Since osmostress modulates the activity of multiple pathways affecting TSC2 , we aimed to dissect which ones are principally responsible for the lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 and the TSC2 - mediated inhibition of mTORC1 . Pharmacological inhibition of Akt caused both inhibition of mTORC1 ( Supplementary Fig . S3C ) and a mild but significant recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes ( Fig . 4B ) , as previously reported ( in PTEN - null MEFs 41 ) , indicating that inhibition of Akt contributes towards mTORC1 inactivation and lysosomal recruitment of TSC2 in response to osmostress . In contrast , inhibition of Erk and activation of p38 signaling in response to osmostress appear to play less of a role in the response of mTORC1 . Pretreatment of MEFs with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) prevented the inhibition of Erk in response to osmostress ( p - ERK1 / 2 , Fig . 4C ) , but did not rescue the inactivation of mTORC1 ( p - S6K , Fig . 4C ) . Furthermore , use of a MEK inhibitor ( U0126 ) to inactivate Erk only had a weak effect on mTORC1 activity , and only at later time points ( Fig . 4D ) . Likewise , pharmacological inhibition of p38 with 10 μ M SB203580 prevented the phosphorylation of its downstream target MAPKAPK2 in response to osmostress ( Fig . 4E ) but did not prevent the inactivation of mTORC1 ( p - S6K , Fig . 4E ) , in agreement with a previous report 21 . Both Erk and p38 inhibition resulted in the expected changes in phosphoryl - ation of TSC2 on the respective sites ( Ser664 and Ser1254 ) ( Fig . 4D , E ) 48 – 50 , suggesting that these phos - phorylations are not sufficient to lead to TSC2 activation upon osmostress . In sum , the inhibition of mTORC1 and recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes in response to osmostress is mainly mediated via Akt . Osmostress inhibits Akt and S6K via activation of a Calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase . Since the main contribution towards mTORC1 regulation in the response to osmostress is via Akt , we aimed to delineate the mechanism of Akt inactivation . Although previous reports have come to differing con - clusions regarding the effect of osmostress on Akt activity 16 , 22 , 24 , 25 , our data are in line with previous work , which shows that Akt is inhibited by a calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase 16 , 24 . We performed a time course to analyze the rate of dephosphorylation of Akt on the PDK1 and mTORC2 sites . Treatment of MEFs with LY294002 to inhibit PI3K and hence PDK1 leads to dephosphorylation of Akt on the PDK1 site ( Thr308 ) within 5 minutes ( Fig . 5A lanes 1 – 5 ) . When PDK1 is inhibited in the presence of osmos - tress , the rate of dephosphorylation on this site is increased ( compare lanes 7 to 3 and 8 to 4 , Fig . 5A ) , indicating elevated phosphatase activity . Likewise , inhibition of mTORC2 with Torin1 leads to dephos - phorylation of Akt on the mTORC2 site ( Ser473 ) ( Fig . 5B lanes 1 – 5 ) , which is accelerated in the presence of osmostress ( Fig . 5B lanes 6 – 9 , compare 5 and 10 minute time points ) . Pretreatment of MEFs with calyculin A , an inhibitor of PP2A and PP1 phosphatases , prevented dephosphorylation of Akt , the Akt phosphosite on TSC2 ( Thr1462 ) and impaired mTORC1 inactivation in response to osmostress ( Fig . 5C ) . In line with the effect of calyculin A on TSC2 phosphorylation by Akt , pretreatment with this drug also abolished the lysosomal relocalization of TSC2 in response to osmostress ( Fig . 5D ) . Previous reports showed that S6K dephosphorylation is also mediated by a calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase , such as PP2A 15 , 51 . We therefore tested if a calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase is also acting on S6K in our experimental setup . Indeed , osmostress accelerated ( Supplementary Fig . 4A ) and calycu - lin A pretreatment prevented ( Supplementary Fig . 4B ) the dephosphorylation of S6K in response to the mTOR inhibitor Torin1 . In sum , osmostress activates a calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase that dephos - phorylates Akt , thereby leading to TSC2 activation and accumulation to lysosomes , and in parallel acts on the mTORC1 substrate S6K to cause its dephosphorylation ( Fig . 6 ) . Discussion Previous reports showed that osmostress inhibits mTORC1 15 – 19 , however the mechanism of mTORC1 inactivation was unclear . We show here that osmostress affects TSC2 phosphorylation and subcellular localization , thereby inhibiting mTORC1 via Rheb . Combining our data with data from the literature yields a signaling pathway whereby osmostress activates a calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase , which dephosphorylates Akt on both the PDK1 and mTORC2 sites ( Fig . 6 ) . This leads to inactivation of Akt , loss of TSC2 phosphorylation on the Akt site ( Thr1462 ) , and accumulation on lysosomes where it inac - tivates Rheb and thereby mTORC1 ( Fig . 6 ) . Effects of osmostress on the activity of other kinases , such as p38 and Erk , and the phosphorylation of the respective sites on TSC2 might also contribute to its activation , although they were not sufficient to affect mTORC1 activity , when activated or inhibited singly . In agreement with previous reports 15 , 51 , the calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase also acts on the mTORC1 substrate S6K to dephosphorylate it , thereby providing a possible explanation for the partial TSC2 / Rheb - independent drop in S6K phosphorylation upon osmostress . We previously reported that another stress—amino acid starvation—also causes TSC2 to accumu - late on lysosomes 38 . There are some similarities and some differences between osmostress and amino acid removal that are worth noting . In both cases , TSC2 rapidly relocalizes to lysosomes and acts on Rheb . However , in the case of amino acid withdrawal , this leads to displacement of mTORC1 away from www . nature . com / scientificreports / 8 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 13828 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep13828 lysosomes , whereas in the case of osmostress this does not occur . There are two tethering activities keeping mTORC1 on the lysosome—the Rag GTPases 18 , 38 , 52 and Rheb 38 . Amino acid removal severs both tethering activities ; the Rag GTPases release mTORC1 as a result of GAP activity by the GATOR1 complex 53 , and Rheb releases mTORC1 as a result of inhibition by TSC2 . In contrast , in response to osmostress , the Rag GTPases continue to tether mTORC1 on the lysosome , since they are inactivated specifically by amino acid withdrawal 18 . Figure 5 . Hyperosmotic stress activates a Calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase to regulate Akt and S6K . ( A , B ) Phosphatase activity on Akt is increased upon hyperosmotic stress . Time courses of treatment with 50 μ M LY294002 ( A ) or 250 nM Torin1 ( B ) were performed to inactivate PDK1 or mTORC2 respectively , and observe the rate of dephosphorylation of the respective sites on Akt , both in the absence of hyperosmotic stress or when NaCl is added simultaneously with the drug ( + 100 mM NaCl ) . In the presence of hyperosmotic stress , both the PDK1 ( A ) and the mTORC2 ( B ) sites on Akt become dephosphorylated more quickly than in control conditions . Quantifications of phospho - Akt normalized to total Akt are shown in the lower panels . ( C ) Inhibition of a calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase prevents TSC2 and Akt dephosphorylation and mTORC1 inactivation upon hyperosmotic stress . MEFs were pretreated with DMSO ( “Ctrl” ) or 15 nM Calyculin A for 30 min and then exposed to hyperosmotic medium ( + 100 mM NaCl ) for the indicated times . Lower panel shows quantification of phospho - TSC2 normalized to total TSC2 levels . ( D ) Inhibition of a calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase rescues the osmostress - induced lysosomal accumulation of TSC2 . MEFs were left untreated ( “Ctrl” ) or treated with 100 mM NaCl for 15 min following pretreatment with DMSO ( “NaCl” ) or 15 nM Calyculin A for 5 min ( “Calyc . A + NaCl” ) . TSC2 localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy . LAMP2 staining was used as a lysosomal marker . Representative magnified insets are shown on the right . See also Supplementary Fig . S4 . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 13828 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep13828 Unlike the response of mTORC1 to other stresses , such as removal of growth factor signaling , mTORC1 inactivation in response to osmostress is extremely rapid , taking only a few minutes . Presumably , this is because osmostress is very noxious to the cell 12 – 14 , 54 . This initial , rapid inactivation of mTORC1 to osmostress appears to be partly TSC - dependent ( Fig . 3A and Supplementary Fig . S2B ) , and was the focus of this present study . Two pieces of data suggest , however , that additional TSC2 - and Rheb - independent mechanisms exist to inactivate mTORC1 and its downstream substrates both during the early response to osmostress ( 5 – 10 min after treatment ) and on a longer timescale ( 60 min after treatment , Fig . 6 ) . Firstly , although mTORC1 inactivation in response to osmostress is clearly impaired in TSC2 - null MEFs , they nonetheless do show some mTORC1 inactivation ( Supplementary Fig . S2A and 55 ) . Secondly , expression of active , GTP - locked Rheb does not fully rescue mTORC1 inactivation in response to osmostress at early time points ( Fig . 3D ) and is not sufficient to prevent mTORC1 inhibition at late time points ( 60 minutes in Supplementary Fig . S2C ) . This is unlikely to be due to technical issues , since in our hands the activated Rheb fully rescues mTORC1 inactivation upon 60 minutes of amino acid withdrawal ( Supplementary Fig . S2C ) , in agreement with previous reports 29 , 30 . This suggests osmostress likely activates multiple mechanisms that act in parallel to inhibit mTORC1 and its downstream effectors such as S6K . Indeed , osmostress activates a calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase acting directly on S6K ( Supplementary Fig . 4 and 15 , 51 ) . Furthermore , at later time points osmostress leads to phosphorylation of Raptor by MARK4 19 . It is possible that osmostress also causes additional effects such as dissociation of the mTORC1 complex , similar to what is seen in response to energetic stress 56 . In agreement with this , a previous report found that Rheb overexpression has a mild effect if cells are treated with high sorbitol concentrations ( 600 mM ) for longer time points ( 30 min ) 29 . In sum , several mechanisms ensure robust inactivation of mTORC1 and S6K in response to osmostress , with the early response being largely TSC2 - dependent . Materials and methods Cell Culture .

HeLa and MCF - 7 cells were cultured in high - glu - cose DMEM containing 10 % FBS ( PAA ) . MCF - 7 cells were also supplemented with 1 × non - essential amino acids ( Gibco ) . All media were supplemented with 1 × Penicillin - Streptomycin ( Gibco ) . TSC1 − / − , TSC2 + / + p53 − / − , and TSC2 − / − p53 − / − MEFs were a kind gift by David Kwiatkowski and Michael Hall and were described previously 57 , 58 . Figure 6 . Proposed model for hyperosmotic stress - induced inhibition of mTORC1 . Hyperosmotic stress rapidly inactivates Akt via activation of a Calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase and regulates other signaling pathways ( ERK1 / 2 , p38MAPK ) independently of this phosphatase . Subsequently , TSC2 phosphorylation changes and its lysosomal localization increases , thereby inhibiting Rheb and mTORC1 , as indicated by phosphorylation of its direct substrate S6K . In addition , the Calyculin - A - sensitive phosphatase acts on S6K itself to inactivate it . At later time points , additional TSC2 / Rheb - independent pathways also contribute to mTORC1 inhibition . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 10 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 13828 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep13828 The identity of HEK293FT , HeLa , and MCF - 7 cells was verified using the Multiplex human Cell line Authentication service ( MCA , Multiplexion GmbH ) , which uses an SNP - profiling approach and was performed as described at www . multiplexion . de . The HEK293FT , HeLa , MCF - 7 , TSC2 + / + p53 − / − and TSC2 − / − p53 − / − MEF cell lines were verified to be Mycoplasma - free and free of contamination with cells of other species , according to the Multiplex cell Contamination Test Report ( Multiplexion GmbH ) , as described at www . multiplexion . de . Cell treatments and media composition . Hyperosmotic stress conditions were applied by addition of NaCl or sorbitol to the culture media . The concentration of NaCl in serum - free normal culture media ( high - glucose DMEM , Gibco ) is 110 . 35 mM and the overall osmolality is 320 – 360 mOsm / kg , according to the manufacturer’s specifications . An increase of the NaCl concentration by 100 mM or addition of 200 mM sorbitol to full , serum - containing media raises osmolality to ≤ 500 mOsm / kg 20 . For reversal of hyperosmotic stress , the hypertonic media were removed and replaced by normal culture media . Amino acid starvation was carried out as previously described 38 . In brief , the culture media were replaced with treatment media containing or lacking only all amino acids . Treatment media were sup - plemented with 10 % dialyzed FBS . The starvation media were formulated according to the Gibco recipe for high - glucose DMEM , omitting the amino acids . Pharmacological treatments using Akt inhibitor VIII ( # 124018 , Calbiochem ) , MEK1 / 2 inhibitor U0126 ( # 9903 , Cell Signaling Technology ) , PKC activator phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) ( # P8139 , Sigma ) , p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 ( # AG - CR1 – 0030 - M001 , AdipoGen ) , PI3K inhibitor LY294002 ( # 9901 , Cell Signaling Technology ) , mTOR inhibitor Torin1 ( # Cay10997 , Cayman Chemical ) , and phos - phatase inhibitor Calyculin A ( sc - 24000 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , were performed as described in the figure legends .

An antibody against phospho - TSC2 ( S664 ) was purchased from Abcam ( ab133465 ) . The mouse LAMP2 ( ABL - 93 ) antibody was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank . A monoclonal antibody recog - nizing human and mouse α - tubulin ( # T9026 ) and an anti - FLAG ( M2 ) ( # F1804 ) antibody were pur - chased from Sigma . All antibodies were used in 1 : 1000 dilution for western blotting , except for the phospho - ERK , total ERK , TSC2 , and p38 antibodies that were used in 1 : 2000 . Cell lysis and Western blotting . For SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting experiments , cells were lysed in - well with ice - cold Triton lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM NaF , 2 mM Na - vanadate , 0 . 011 gr / ml beta - glycerophosphate , 1 × PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitors and 1 × Complete protease inhibitors ) for 10 minutes on ice . Samples were clarified by centrifugation ( 15 min , 14 , 000 rpm , 4 °C ) , and SDS loading buffer was added to the supernatant before boiling . The samples were analyzed by 1D gel electrophoresis and phospho - and total protein levels were detected using the appropriate antibodies . Quantification of immunoblots was performed using the LICOR Fc detection system and the ImageStudio software ( most panels ) or by densitometry of films with ImageJ ( p - 4E - BP1 panels in Figs 1A , C , 4D and 5C ) . Plasmid constructs . For the pcDNA3 - FLAG - Rheb WT expression vector , full - length Rheb was amplified from human cDNA with oligos containing the appropriate restriction enzyme overhangs and cloned in the EcoRI / NotI sites , in frame with the FLAG tag sequence in pcDNA3 - FLAG . The S16H point mutant was created by site - directed mutagenesis . A similar vector expressing FLAG - tagged firefly Luciferase was used as a negative control ( pcDNA3 - FLAG - Luc ) . The Luciferase gene was amplified from a pGL3 vector ( Promega ) and cloned in the EcoRI / NotI sites , in frame with the FLAG tag sequence in pcDNA3 - FLAG . The integrity of all constructs and the presence of point mutations was verified by sequencing . The pLJM1 - FLAG - Raptor WT and pLJM1 - FLAG - Raptor - Rheb15 were a gift from David Sabatini ( Addgene plasmids # 26633 and 26634 ) and have been described previously 34 . Plasmid transfections . Plasmid DNA transfections in HEK293FT cells were performed using Effectene ( QIAGEN ) , according to manufacturer’s instructions . Cell Imaging / Immunofluorescence . Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as previ - ously described 38 . In brief , cells were seeded on fibronectin - coated glass coverslips and treated as indi - cated in each experiment . Following treatments , cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4 % PFA in PBS . Samples were washed / permeabilized twice with PBT solution ( 1 × PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) www . nature . com / scientificreports / 11 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 13828 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep13828 for 10 min , and blocked with BBT solution ( 1 × PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , 0 . 1 % BSA ) for 45 min . Stainings were performed with the indicated primary antibodies diluted in BBT ( 1 : 100 – 1 : 200 ) for 2 h , following 1 h incubation with appropriate highly cross - adsorbed secondary fluorescent antibodies . Nuclei were stained with DAPI and the coverslips were mounted on slides using a glycerol - based mounting medium ( 80 % glycerol , 1 × PBS , 0 , 4 % propyl gallate ) . Images from single channel captures are shown in grayscale . For the merged images , FITC is shown in green , and TRITC in red . The images were captured using a 40 × objective lens and 3 × zoom on an SP8 Leica confocal microscope . All cell images within each panel were acquired and displayed using the same settings .
