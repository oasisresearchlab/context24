De Camilli , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , and approved May 19 , 2006 ( received for review April 25 , 2006 ) Clathrin - coated pits assemble on a membrane and pinch off as coated vesicles . The released vesicles then rapidly lose their clath - rin coats in a process mediated by the ATPase Hsc70 , recruited by auxilin , a J - domain - containing cofactor . How is the uncoating process regulated ? We ﬁnd that during coat assembly small and variable amounts of auxilin are recruited transiently but that a much larger burst of association occurs after the peak of dynamin signal , during the transition between membrane constriction and vesicle budding . We show that the auxilin burst depends on domains of the protein likely to interact with lipid head groups . We conclude that the timing of auxilin recruitment determines the onset of uncoating . We propose that , when a diffusion barrier is established at the constricting neck of a fully formed coated pit and immediately after vesicle budding , accumulation of a speciﬁc lipid can recruit sufﬁcient auxilin molecules to trigger uncoating . hsc70 (cid:1) endocytosis (cid:1) lipids T he cycle of clathrin - coated vesicle formation and disassembly requires coordinated interaction of a large number of pro - teins . Clathrin forms a lattice surrounding the invaginating membrane . Various adaptor proteins provide the links required for sorting cargo proteins into assembling coated pits . Additional proteins regulate coat formation and coat disassembly . Coat assembly is relatively steady , whereas disassembly is abrupt . The entire cycle typically lasts for 30 – 90 s ( 1 ) . Biochemical and genetic observations indicate that Hsc70 and its cofactor , auxilin , are directly involved in the uncoating process ( 2 ) . Hsc70 , an abundant and ubiquitous cytosolic protein , has an ATPase domain linked to a claw - like , substrate - binding domain ( 3 ) . Through their J - domain , auxilins recruit Hsc70 molecules to their substrate , clathrin - coated vesicles ( 4 – 8 ) . Mammalian cells express two auxilin variants , the brain - specific auxilin1 ( Aux1 ) and the ubiquitous cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) , also called auxilin2 . Auxilins have a region with high sequence similarity to the phos - phatase and C2 domains of PTEN ( 9 ) , a central segment with binding sites for dynamin ( 10 ) , AP - 2 , and clathrin ( 8 , 11 , 12 ) and a C - terminal J - domain . In addition , GAK contains an N - terminal Ser (cid:2) Thr kinase domain that phosphorylates in vitro the (cid:1) - chains of AP - 1 and AP - 2 clathrin adaptors ( 8 , 13 ) . Hsc70 promotes dissoci - ation of clathrin coats in vitro by a mechanism that depends on ATP hydrolysis and on Hsc70 recruitment by substoichiometric amounts of auxilin ( 14 ) . The C - terminal half of Aux1 , lacking the PTEN - like domain , canalsosupportuncoating invitro ( 15 ) . Thepositionofthis fragment within the clathrin lattice , in contact with three different clathrin legs , has been determined by cryoelectron microscopy ( 16 ) . Coated pits assemble continuously until the coated vesicles pinch off , and only then does the coat dissociate . Partially assembled lattices should be able to recruit both auxilins and the ATP - bound Hsc70 constitutively present in the cytosol , and therefore they should uncoat prematurely . Premature uncoating might be pre - vented , either by activating bound auxilin only after finishing coat growth or by restricting auxilin recruitment to completed coated vesicles . To work out which of these two possibilities determines the onset of uncoating , we used live - cell imaging to follow the dynamics of auxilin recruitment into assembling endocytic clathrin coats . We find that small and variable amounts of auxilin accumulate and dissociate during the growing phase , whereas much larger amounts arrive during the rapid transition between membrane invagination and budding of the coated vesicle . This late burst of auxilin requires its phosphatase - like domain and correlates strongly with the rup - ture of physical continuity between the plasma membrane and the invaginated vesicular membrane . We further demonstrate that Aux1 binds to specific phosphoinositides in vitro and that the PTEN - like region of auxilin is required for this binding . We propose that the onset of uncoating is determined by a precise timing of auxilin recruitment to the coat . This timing may be set by a rapid change in the concentration of a specific phosphoinositide . Results Auxilins Are Present in All Isolated Clathrin - Coated Vesicles but only in a Small Fraction of Clathrin - Coated Structures at the Cell Surface . To work out what determines the onset of uncoating , we first studied by fluorescence microscopy the association of auxilins with clathrin - coated structures in fixed cells . Auxilins were present in only a fraction of clathrin - coated structures at the cell surface . Whereas all fluorescent spots containing EGFP - Aux1 and (cid:1) 70 % of the EGFP - GAK spots colocalized with clathrin or AP - 2 , only a small fraction ( 10 (cid:2) 3 % ; n (cid:3) 150 ) of the clathrin or AP - 2 spots colocalized with auxilins ( Fig . 1 a ) . We found a similar colocaliza - tion of clathrin or AP - 2 with endogenous Aux1 in astrocytes or with GAK in the epithelial kidney cell line BSC1 ( Fig . 1 b ) . In the latter case , clathrin and AP - 2 were visualized by stable expression of EGFP - LCa or (cid:2) 2 - EGFP . Few of the spots of endogenous auxilins failed to coincide with either LCa or (cid:2) 2 . In contrast to the presence of auxilins in only a fraction of the structures containing clathrin or AP - 2 , we detected them in all isolated coated vesicles ( Fig . 1 c ) . This result suggests that auxilin associates with coated pits at one particular time of their assembly cycle , presumably at a late step of pit formation or immediately after coated - vesicle budding . Auxilin Is Transiently Recruited to the Plasma Membrane at Late Stages of Coated Vesicle Formation . To characterize the temporal behavior of auxilins as they associate with clathrin coats , we used live - cell imaging to follow the recruitment of Aux1 and GAK to the plasma membrane of astrocytes ( see Cells ) ( Figs . 6 – 8 , which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . The fluorescence signals of Aux1 ( green in Fig . 2 a ) or GAK ( green in Fig . 2 b ) showed small , low - amplitude fluctuations during clathrin coat assembly and a major burst at the end of the growth phase ( red ) ( Movie 1 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Every instance of disappearance of a clathrin - coated pit ( e . g . , corresponding to the uncoating of an endocytic vesicle ) had an associated Aux1 or GAK burst ; these bursts were detected in at least three consecutive time frames , and their Conﬂict of interest statement : No conﬂicts declared .

The probability of an incorrect assign - ment by our tracking algorithm is (cid:4) 10 (cid:5) 4 . The maximal peak signal of the EGFP - Aux1 bursts corresponds to (cid:1) 20 – 40 molecules , because their intensities were four to five times lower than the EGFP - LCa signals from coated vesicles observed in BSC1 cells just before uncoating ( (cid:1) 100 – 120 molecules ; ref . 1 ) . In the majority of cases ( (cid:1) 90 % of 148 events ) a single burst started immediately before the clathrin signal reached its maximum , hence just before completion of coat assembly ( clathrin - coated pit stage ) ( Fig . 2 c ) . In the remaining few cases there were two or more recruitment events just before the end of the growth phase ( Fig . 2 c ) . We observed no significant correlation between the sizes of the clathrin coats before uncoating ( estimated by the maximum net signal of clathrin ) and the number of auxilin molecules recruited in the final burst ( Fig . 2 d ) . We likewise found no correlation between the time required to build the coat ( growth phase ) and the time used to uncoat it ( Fig . 2 e , uncoating phase ) . We confirmed that the recruitment of auxilin to fully formed clathrin - coated structures happens during the transition from a coated structure still close to the plasma membrane ( e . g . , a coated pit ready to pinch off ) to a structure that moves away from it ( e . g . , a budded coated vesicle ) . We did so by measuring the fluorescence intensity of EGFP - Aux1 while rapidly alternating between total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) and wide - field acquisition modes . In (cid:1) 55 % of the EGFP - Aux1 objects the TIRF signal disappeared faster than the wide - field signal ( Fig . 9 a , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , indicating that Aux1 was present in objects that had escaped the evanescent field ( (cid:1) 140 nm ) by moving away from the ventral plasma membrane toward the cell interior . In the remaining cases the simultaneous disappearance of both fluorescence signals indi - cated that the Aux1 association and dissociation happened in objects that remained within the evanescent field , close to the plasma membrane , until complete uncoating ( Fig . 9 b ) . We ob - served a similar behavior for GAK ( Fig . 9 c and d ) . The PTEN Homology Region of Aux1 Is Required for the Burst of Recruitment to a Clathrin - Coated Pit .

The recruitment of Aux1 and GAK ( data not shown ) lacking the J - domain showed the same temporal pattern as full - length auxilin , indicating that this domain is not required for association with coats in cells . Removal of the complete PTEN homology domain strongly impaired the burst of Aux1 recruitment ( Movie 2 , which is published as sup - porting information on the PNAS web site ) ; removal of just the phosphatase - like domain produced a similar perturbation ( Movie 3 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . It is unlikely that the targeting defects elicited by these truncated mutants are due to a major misfolding of Aux1 , because the mutants are recruited to the clathrin microcages and other latticesformedincellsupontransienthypertonicshockwithsucrose ( 17 ) ( Fig . 10 a , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . The transient appearance of small amounts of auxilin during coat assembly is also unimpaired . We did not observe any detectable decrease in the endocytosis of transferrin ( Fig . 7 ) , suggesting that these variants are not dominant , presumably be - causetheavailableendogenousWTauxilinsaresufficienttosustainuncoating . How can the PTEN - like region influence recruitment ? The homology with the phosphatase domain of PTEN and the presence of a C2 lipid - binding domain suggest that it might recognize lipid head groups . In a lipid overlay assay we found that recombinant Aux1 binds phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) ( 3 ) - phosphate , PI ( 4 ) phos - phate , and PI ( 3 , 4 ) - biphosphate more strongly than various other phosphoinositides or negatively charged lipids ( Fig . 3 c ) . In contrast , a truncated form of Aux1 , lacking residues 1 – 546 ( e . g . , without the PTEN - like region ) , did not bind any of these lipids ( Fig . 11 b , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Dynamin Function Is Required for the Major Recruitment of Auxilin . TheabruptrecruitmentofEGFP - Aux1atthetransitionfromafully formed coated pit to a coated vesicle suggests a relationship to dynamin activity . We examined the correlation of dynamin and auxilin bursts [ using transiently expressed dynamin2 ( Dyn2 ) – monomeric red fluorescent protein ( mRFP ) and stably expressed EGFP - Aux1 ] and found that all of the Aux1 correlated with a small but significant peak in the dynamin signal , generally (cid:1) 1 – 2 s before the auxilin maximum ( Fig . 4 a and Fig . 12 b , which is published as Fig . 3 .

We then explored the relationship between the dynamics of these two proteins by three complementary approaches ( 1 ) . We depleted endogenous Dyn2 in cells stably expressing EGFP - Aux1 by treatment with small interfering RNA oligonucleotides ( 18 ) . We could not detect EGFP - Aux1 recruitment to the plasma membrane ( Movie 4 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) in any cell that showed the expected block in transferrin uptake ( Fig . 13 a , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . These latter cells still displayed punctate clathrin and AP - 2 patterns ( Fig . 13 b and c ) ( 2 ) . We transiently overexpressed the dominant negative mutant Dyn2 - K44A ( 19 ) fused to mRFP . Ex - pression of this mutant impaired transferrin uptake and reduced EGFP - Aux1 recruitment to spots on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 10 b and Movie 5 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) ; control cells overexpressing WT Dyn2 - mRFP showed no perturbations in clathrin - mediated endocytosis or Aux1 dynamics ( Movie6 , whichispublishedassupportinginformationon the PNAS web site ) ( 3 ) . We treated cells with dynasore , a small molecule that acutely , specifically , and reversibly inhibits the dy - namin GTPase , thereby blocking transferrin uptake and locking coated pits at stages before budding ( 20 ) . Dynasore abolished the final burst of auxilin recruitment ( Fig . 4 b ) ; a substantially weaker auxilin signal ( 25 – 50 % less than normal ) remained associated with the locked pits . Auxilin and dynamin have been reported to interact directly in vitro through a region of auxilin that lies between the PTEN homology domain and the clathrin - binding domain ( 10 ) . Could this interaction account for the correlations described in the preceding paragraph ? At least two lines of evidence suggest otherwise . First , the actual dynamics are different . Dynamin is recruited steadily to coated pits , with an incremental burst at the time of pinching ( 1 ) , whereas the auxilin burst begins essentially at baseline . Second , truncated Aux1 that lacks the PTEN - like region but retains the dynamin - binding segment exhibits no late burst in intensity , whereas its early , low - level , transient recruitment appears to be normal . We therefore believe that a direct interaction between the two proteins cannot account for the major auxilin burst . Discussion Our principal finding is that auxilin recruitment to a coated pit occurs primarily in a burst just as growth is complete and as budding occurs . We conclude that the timing of this recruitment is the process that triggers rapid uncoating shortly after assembly has finished . There is also a low level of transient auxilin incorporation during the growth phase of a coated pit . One function for these auxilins ( and the Hsc70 that they presumably bring along ) might be to release a few clathrin triskelions from the growing edge of the pit , perhaps to correct errors appearing during assembly . Another might be to promote local disassembly , possibly required to accom - modate a change in curvature of the underlying membrane in response to incorporation of cargo of larger size . Auxilin could also have a function distinct from its role as an Hsc70 cochaperone . We can imagine two general ways in which the major burst of auxilin recruitment could be timed . In one class of mechanism , interactions with clathrin , APs , dynamin , or other proteins would recruit auxilin , and the regulation of those interactions , e . g . , by phosphorylation or other modification , would in turn determine the timing of auxilin association . A model based exclusively on the modulation of protein – protein interactions would , however , re - quire coordinated modification of all 20 – 40 auxilin molecules during the major burst or of an equivalent number of partner proteins distributed throughout the coat . It is difficult to imagine how local modifications can be coordinated across so large a structure . A second kind of mechanism , based on topological constraints , provides a simpler explanation to account for the major burst of auxilin recruitment before uncoating . A specific lipid species , generated by an enzymatic modification within the coated membrane and perhaps recognized by the PTEN domain , might act as a recruiting signal for auxilin . For example , it is known that synaptojanin , a phosphoinositide phosphatase that binds proteins linked to endocytosis , is needed for the normal completion of the coated vesicle cycle ( 21 – 28 ) . This enzyme dephosphorylates PI ( 4 , 5 ) - biphosphate phosphoinositides to create PI ( 4 ) phosphate ( 29 ) , one of the lipids shown here to bind auxilin , which could be the recruiting signal for auxilin . During all stages of coat formation before vesicle budding , the underlying membrane remains con - nected to the plasma membrane , and any such lipid will rapidly diffuse into the surrounding membrane . It will therefore fail to reach the concentration threshold needed to capture enough auxi - lin for productive uncoating . Only when a diffusion barrier is established at the connecting neck or after the vesicle has been topologically isolated from the plasma membrane ( i . e . , after fission ) can the concentration of the postulated lipid increase sufficiently to support the coordinated recruitment of a large number of auxilin molecules ( Fig . 5 ) . The internal location of the Aux1 C - terminal portion seen by cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction would allow the PTEN region to extend inward and contact the mem - brane ( 16 ) . Four findings support this proposal ( 1 ) . Auxilin association with the clathrin lattice is relatively weak ( 16 ) , and a strong association will probably require an additional set of contacts ( 2 ) . All known perturbations that block budding but still retain clathrin coats at the plasma membrane also prevent late auxilin recruitment and thus prevent uncoating . The perturbations include removal of dynamin by small interfering RNA treatment and inhibition of dynamin function either by expression of Dyn2K44A mutant or by treatment ofthecellswithdynasore . Cholesteroldepletion , bybriefincubation of the cells with cyclodextrins , also retains clathrin arrays at the plasma membrane , blocks budding , impairs auxilin recruitment ( Movie 7 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , and prevents coordinated uncoating . Thus , dis - continuitybetweentheplasmamembraneandafullyformedvesicle Fig . 5 . Model for the recruitment of auxilin . The principal stages leading to the auxilin burst and its relation to the onset of clathrin coat disassembly are shown . The plasma membrane is represented by the orange line ; the mem - brane containing the lipid signal used to recruit auxilin is shown in gray . During the growth phase , cargo , clathrin , adaptors , and other coat compo - nentscontinuouslyaccumulate . Continuedgrowthresultsindeepmembrane invaginations , until membrane constriction and ﬁssion coordinated by a ﬁnal burst of dynamin occur . After budding , the coated vesicle moves away from the membrane , and uncoating rapidly ensues . Small and variable amounts of auxilin associate to and dissociate from growing pits , while a large burst of auxilin recruitment starts during membrane constriction and ends with the onset of uncoating . At this stage , sufﬁcient amounts of ATP - bound Hsc70 are captured by auxilin to drive coat disassembly . In this model , a lipid species ( indicated by the gray shadowing of the membrane ) , generated within the coated membrane and perhaps recognized by the PTEN - like domain of auxi - lin , acts as a recruiting signal for auxilin . Before vesicle budding , the under - lying membrane remains connected to the plasma membrane , and any such lipid will rapidly diffuse into the surrounding membrane . It will therefore fail to reach the concentration threshold needed to capture enough auxilin to ensue coat disassembly . 10268 (cid:1) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0603369103 Massol et al . appears essential for auxilin recruitment before uncoating ( 3 ) . Removal either of the entire PTEN homology domain of auxilin or of just the phosphatase - like domain completely prevents the final burst of auxilin , even though binding sites for dynamin , AP - 2 , clathrin , and Hsc70 are still present on the truncated auxilins . The C2 domain of PTEN has been reported to confer nonspecific recognition of lipid head groups ( 30 ) , and it seems likely that the auxilin C2 domain functions similarly . The phosphatase - like do - main of auxilin lacks the residues in PTEN essential for catalytic activity toward phosphoinositides , but the extent of sequence identity is sufficiently high that recognition of phosphoinositides is possible ( 4 ) . Purified full - length Aux1 ( but not a truncated form lacking its PTEN - like region ) displays preferential binding to phosphoinositides in a lipid overlay assay . Treatment with wort - mannin or LY - 294002 ( Fig . 12 a ) did not alter coat dynamics in a noticeable way ; this lack of an effect could be due to incomplete PI 3 - kinase inhibition ( 31 ) or to the presence of a pool of PI ( 3 ) - phosphate lipids with a relatively slow turnover . Future studies will be needed to identify the lipid species recognized by auxilin and to test its role in triggering uncoating . Materials and Methods Plasmids , Oligos , Transfections , and Protein Purification . Full - length bovine Aux1 ( 910 residues ) was amplified by PCR from a full - length cDNA clone and inserted into pEGFP - C1 ( CLON - TECH ) , resulting in pEGFP - Aux1 . The C - terminal J - domain of Aux1 was removed by using an internal BamHI site to create a truncation after M812 ( pEGFP - Aux1 (cid:7) J ) . The N - terminal PTEN homology region or the phosphatase - like domain was removed by QuikChange mutagenesis ( Stratagene ) by incorpo - rating a HindIII site after Q419 or a BglII site after L216 . The resulting HindIII (cid:2) SacII or BglII (cid:2) SacII fragment was transferred into pEGFP - C1 , resulting in pEGFP - (cid:7) PTEN Aux1 or pEGFP - (cid:7) PDAux1 . Full - length rat Dyn2 WT or K44A ( 874 residues ) EGFP fusions were a generous gift of Sandy Schmidt ( The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ) . mRFP was amplified from pRSETb and substituted for EGFP in WT and K44A versions of Dyn2 - EGFP . Full - length LCa and (cid:2) 2 fused to EGFP ( pEGFP - LCa and p (cid:2) 2 - EGFP , respectively ) were previously described ( 1 ) . The sequence corresponding to the tandem repeat tomato ORF ( 476 residues ) was amplified by PCR and substi - tuted for EGFP in pEGFP - LCa using Age1 (cid:2) BsrGI sites ( pTom - LCa ) . All constructs were verified by restriction digest and sequence analysis . All transfections were carried out by using FuGENE 6 ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis ) , and cells were evaluated 16 – 48 h later or selected with geneticin to obtain stable cell lines . The sequence of the double - stranded small interfering RNA oligo ( Dharmacon , Lafayette , CO ) targeting human Dyn2 was the following : sense strand , 5 (cid:8) - GGAGAUU - GAAGCAGAGACCTT - 3 (cid:8) ; antisense strand , 5 (cid:8) - GGUCU - CUGCUUCAAUCUCCTG - 3 (cid:8) . Small interfering RNA oligo targeting CD4 was used as a negative silencer control . Trans - fections of oligos were performed by using Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer’s recommendations . Cells were tested 96 h after transfection . For bacterial expression of auxilin we transferred Aux1 from pEGFP - Aux1 into pGEX - 4T - 1 using BglII and SalI restriction enzymes , resulting in full - length Aux1 fused to GST ( pGEX - 4T - 1 - Aux1 ) , which was then used to transform BL21 - pLys cells . Expres - sion was achieved after overnight growth at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (cid:2) kanamycin , followed by in - oculation of 10 ml into 1 liter of fresh LB medium and further allowed to grow for 2 – 3 h at room temperature ( OD 560 (cid:1) 0 . 5 – 0 . 7 ) before adding isopropyl - 13 - D - thiogalactoside ( 0 . 1 mM final ) . Cells were harvest by centrifugation after a further incubation for 16 h , washed with cold PBS , resuspended , and lysed by sonication at 4°C ( four pulses of 1 min , 30 s of cooling ) in the presence of complete protease inhibitors ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) and 1 mM PMSF . The lysate was clarified by centrifugation ( 34 , 000 (cid:9) g , 20 min , 4°C ) , and the GST - Aux1 protein was isolated by using gluta - thione affinity columns . The yield is consistently very low ( 0 . 07 – 0 . 15 mg (cid:2) liter of culture ) , and the preparation consists of full - length Aux1 and several fragments . For insect cell expression of Aux1 we transferred Aux1 from pEGFPAux1 into the pFastBac HT vector ( Invitrogen ) using BglII and PstI . This plasmid was used to transform DH10Bac cells to produce , upon recombination , the bacmids coding for full - length N - terminal His 6 - tagged Aux1 . Sf9 insect cells were transfected with the resulting bacmids , and the amplified virus was used to transduce High Five insect cells ( 1 – 2 (cid:9) 10 6 cells per ml ; volume , 500 ml infected with a 1 : 600 dilution of viral stock ) . Cells were harvested 56 – 72 h after infection , and Aux1 was purified by using TALON metal affinity resin ( CLONTECH ) as described ( 32 ) . This proce - dure provides a moderate yield of mostly full - length His 6 - tagged Aux1 ( 0 . 5 – 0 . 7 mg (cid:2) liter of culture ) and with no detectable contam - inants observed by Coomassie blue staining . Cells . Sf9 and High Five insect cells were grown in ExCell 420 medium at 28°C in spinner flasks . BSC1 , HeLa , HEK - 293 , and U373mg astrocytes were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , 2 mM L - glutamine , penicillin ( 50 units (cid:2) ml ) , streptomycin ( 50 mg (cid:2) ml ) , and nonessential amino acids ( 0 . 1 mM ) . The human U373mg astrocytes offer the proper cellular context to study the brain - specific endogenous Aux1 . U373mg cell lines , stably express - ing EGFP fusion chimeras of Aux1 , EGFP - clathrin light chain ( LCa ) , or (cid:2) 2 - EGFP were generated by selection with 0 . 5 – 0 . 7 mg (cid:2) ml geneticin . The rates of the growth and uncoating phases of clathrin - coated structures observed by using LCa and AP - 2 fused to fluorescent proteins is very similar ( Fig . 8 a – c ) . The relative expression level of EGFP - Aux1 in the crude microsomal fraction containing clathrin - coated vesicles was 4 – 5 times higher than the expression level of endogenous Aux1 ; there was no significant replacement of endogenous Aux1 associated with this fraction . Simultaneous expression of EGFP - Aux1 with tomato - LCa or with mRFP - dynamin was performed by transient expression of the red fluorescent proteins in cells stably expressing EGFP - Aux1 or by transient coexpression of the green and red fluorescent proteins . Cells were seeded on glass coverslips and imaged 16 – 72 h later at (cid:1) 50 – 70 % confluency . EGFP - Aux1 was recruited to diffraction - limited spots at the ventral ( Fig . 6 a and b and Movie 8 a , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) and dorsal ( Movie 8 b ) surfaces of the cell with a residence time of 8 (cid:2) 1 . 5 s ( n (cid:3) 150 – 270 particles per cell analyzed from six cells ; Fig . 6 c ) . We obtained comparable results upon transient expression of EGFP - Aux1 in HeLa , HEK - 293 , and BSC1 cells ( Movie 8 c ) and of EGFP - GAK in astrocytes ( Fig . 6 d – f and Movie 9 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Expression of EGFP - tagged Aux1 or GAK did not affect the uptake of transferrin ( Fig . 7 ) or the duration of coat formation and uncoating ( Fig . 8 d and e ) . Theredfluorescentproteintomatofused to clathrin LCa does not disturb the dynamic behavior of endocytic - coated structures or the endocytosis of transferrin ( Fig . 8 f ) . Immunofluorescence . Cells were fixed in 3 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature , washed with PBS , blocked with 50 mM NH 4 Cl in PBS for 15 min at room temperature , and finally incubated with 2 % BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature . AllantibodiesweredilutedinPBSsupplementedwith 2 % BSA and 0 . 1 % saponin . Aux1 was labeled with the mouse monoclonal antibody 100 (cid:2) 4 that recognizes only Aux1 ( 33 ) . Aux1 and GAK were simultaneously labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody . Clathrin heavy chain , (cid:3) - adaptins , and dynamin were labeled with the mouse monoclonal antibodies X22 ( 34 ) , 10A ( 35 ) , and Hudy - 1 ( Upstate Biotechnology ) , respectively . Alexa Fluor 488 - , Alexa Fluor 594 - , or Alexa Fluor 647 - labeled goat anti - mouse Massol et al . PNAS (cid:1) July 5 , 2006 (cid:1) vol . 103 (cid:1) no . 27 (cid:1) 10269 C E LL B I O L O G Y or anti - rabbit were used as secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) . Lipid – Protein Overlay Assay . PIP Strips hydrophobic membranes , spotted with 15 different biologically active lipids ( Echelon Bio - sciences , Salt Lake City , UT ) , were used to determine lipid – Aux1 interactions following the manufacturer’s instructions . Bound Aux1 was detected by using either a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for His 6 ( His - 1 , Sigma ) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for Aux1 (cid:2) GAK followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and ECL ( Amer - sham Pharmacia ) . The intensity of each spot was corrected by the signal of the membrane immediately adjacent to the spot by using IMAGE J ( 36 ) . Live - Cell Imaging . Cells grown on 25 - mm - diameter coverslips ( no . 1 . 5 , Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) were washed with sterile PBS and placed into an open perfusion chamber , and prewarmed medium was added . The chamber was inserted into a sample holder ( 20 (cid:2) 20 Technology , Wilmington , NC ) placed on top of the microscope stage enclosed by an environmental chamber ( 37°C ) . The cells were maintained in a humidified environment of 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 . Most experiments were done by using MEM without phenol red supplemented with 20 mM Hepes ( HMEM ) and 0 . 5 g (cid:2) dl BSA . Experiments carried in the presence of 80 (cid:1) M dynasore or 10 mM methyl - (cid:3) - cyclodextrin were done with PBS supplemented with 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , glucose ( 4 . 5 g (cid:2) liter ) , and 1 % Nuserum . To test the effect of inhibition of PI 3 - kinases in EGFP - Aux1 recruitment and dynamics we incubated cells with 0 . 5 – 10 (cid:1) M wortmannin or 30 (cid:1) M LY - 294002 in HMEM for up to 30 min . HMEM containing the inhibitors was added fresh during the recording of the time lapse . Transferrin uptake followed using Alexa Fluor 594 - or Alexa Fluor 647 - labeled human trans - ferrin ( Molecular Probes ) added to the media . Image Acquisition . All spinning - disk confocal - based imaging exper - iments were conducted by using the microscope setup previously described ( 1 ) captured with SLIDEBOOK 4 software ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver ) . A second microscope was equipped with a TIRF slider ( Zeiss ) , illuminated with a 40 - mW solid - state laser ( Crystal Laser , Reno , NV ) for TIRF , and selected with a computer - controlledacoustoopticaltunablefilterandwitha175 - W Xe lamp Lambda DG - 4 ( Sutter Instruments , Novato , CA ) for wide - field illumination ; the images were acquired with a charge - coupled device camera ( Cascade , Photometrics , Tucson ) set with no electronic amplification using a (cid:9) 100 objective lens ( n . a . 1 . 45 , Zeiss ) . The TIRF laser beam was focused at an off - axis position in the back focal plane of lens by using a TIRF slider ( Zeiss ) , with an angle of incidence above the critical angle necessary to achieve total internal reflection . The spherical aberration was corrected with a computer - driven SACS device ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) . Exposure times were 100 – 300 ms . Image Processing and Analysis . An image analysis application ( IAB ) was developed with MATLAB 7 ( Mathworks , Natick , MA ) to identify and track fluorescent objects by using the same criteria previously described ( 1 ) and also to carry out all data analysis . Objects tracks were defined as follows : background smoothing followed by a Gaussian , Laplacian , intensity threshold filtering and three - dimensional connectivity of resulting masks . Object tracks with the following characteristics were eliminated : ( i ) objects with masks diameters larger than three to five pixels ( 378 – 500 nm , depending on the camera used ) ; ( ii ) objects tracks shorter than three consec - utive time frames ; ( iii ) objects present in the first or last frame of the time series ; ( iv ) objects whose centroid moved more than two pixels between consecutive time frames ; ( v ) tracks corresponding to merge or dissociation of nearby objects ; ( vi ) tracks of coated pits appearing before the disappearance of another at the same site . All particle tracks were validated manually . Statistical analysis was performed by using MATLAB 7 or SIGMAPLOT 7 . 0 ( SYSTAT , Point Richmond , CA ) . We are grateful to Drs . E .
