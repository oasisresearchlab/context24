Jaeger 1 * Abstract Background One of the primary aims of contact restriction measures during the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic has been to protect people at increased risk of severe disease from the virus . Knowledge about the uptake of contact restriction measures in this group is critical for public health decision - making . We analysed data from the German contact survey COVIMOD to assess differences in contact patterns based on risk status , and compared this to pre - pandemic data to establish whether there was a differential response to contact reduction measures . Methods We quantified differences in contact patterns according to risk status by fitting a generalised linear model accounting for within - participant clustering to contact data from 31 COVIMOD survey waves ( April 2020 - December 2021 ) , and estimated the population - averaged ratio of mean contacts of persons with high risk for a severe COVID - 19 outcome due to age or underlying health conditions , to those without . We then compared the results to pre - pan - demic data from the contact surveys HaBIDS and POLYMOD . Results Averaged across all analysed waves , COVIMOD participants reported a mean of 3 . 21 ( 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) 3 . 14 , 3 . 28 ) daily contacts ( truncated at 100 ) , compared to 18 . 10 ( 95 % CI 17 . 12 , 19 . 06 ) in POLYMOD and 28 . 27 ( 95 % CI 26 . 49 , 30 . 15 ) in HaBIDS . After adjusting for confounders , COVIMOD participants aged 65 or above had 0 . 83 times ( 95 % CI 0 . 79 , 0 . 87 ) the number of contacts as younger age groups . In POLYMOD , this ratio was 0 . 36 ( 95 % CI 0 . 30 , 0 . 43 ) . There was no clear difference in contact patterns due to increased risk from underlying health conditions in either HaBIDS or COVIMOD . We also found that persons in COVIMOD at high risk due to old age increased their non - household contacts less than those not at such risk after strict restriction measures were lifted . † Jasmin Walde and Madhav Chaturvedi contributed equally as first authors . * Correspondence : Veronika K .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 205 Conclusions Over the course of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , there was a general reduction in contact numbers in the German population and also a differential response to contact restriction measures based on risk status for severe COVID - 19 . This differential response needs to be taken into account for parametrisations of mathematical models in a pandemic setting . Keywords Contact behaviour , SARS - CoV - 2 , Risk groups Introduction A key strategy in the response to the SARS - CoV - 2 pan - demic has been the population - wide reduction of con - tacts via various non - pharmaceutical interventions . In Germany , for instance , very strict contact reduction measures were put in place from March to May 2020 . The summer of 2020 saw less intense restrictions , but stricter measures were reintroduced in November 2020 which were intensified in December 2020 in response to the second wave of the pandemic [ 1 ] . This was followed by a gradual easing of the restrictions starting from late spring 2021 . Once diagnostic testing became widespread and vaccines were offered to the majority of the population , these restrictions were augmented to include individual vaccination or tested status . For example , from August 2021 , most states in Germany introduced some variation on the so called ‘3G’ rules—individuals had to be either vaccinated , tested negative , or previously infected by SARS - CoV - 2 and recently recovered to be able to access or use large parts of public life [ 2 ] . The effect of all these interventions on individual con - tact behaviour has been assessed in contact surveys , and population - wide reductions in the number of contacts have been reported for various countries [ 3 – 7 ] . However , these studies largely do not take into account differential risk of severe COVID - 19 outcomes in different popula - tion subgroups . One of the main goals of contact reduction measures is to protect people at increased risk of a severe course of COVID - 19 to prevent morbidity and mortality , as well as the overloading of the healthcare system . Research indicates that people who perceived themselves to be at higher risk of severe COVID - 19 made more efforts to reduce close contacts during the pandemic [ 8 ] . Further examination of differences in contact behaviour among different risk groups will provide valuable information for public health policy and communication , as well as the parametrisation of modelling studies . In this study , we provide a comprehensive analysis of contact behaviour during the pandemic , focusing on differences due to risk of severe COVID - 19 . We use data from the longitudinal contact survey COVIMOD [ 7 ] , conducted in Germany over the first two years of the pandemic . We distinguish between groups with and without an increased risk of severe COVID - 19 , due to either old age or an underlying health condition . We also compare these data to data from pre - pandemic surveys to analyse if observed dif - ferences in contact patterns during the pandemic mirror underlying pre - pandemic differences or if they represent a differential response to contact reduction measures . Methods Contact surveys COVIMOD The contact survey COVIMOD ( COVID Pandemic : Social Contacts and MODelling ) was initiated in April 2020 in Germany . Participants were recruited via the market research company Ipsos from members of the online panel i - say . com [ 9 ] , based on quotas about age , sex , and region to ensure that the study population broadly matches the German population with regards to distribution of sociodemographic characteristics . Some more information on how Ipsos creates samples can be found on their website [ 10 ] . A subgroup of adult partici - pants with children under the age of 18 were invited to complete the survey as a proxy for their children . This allowed for the collecting of information about children’s social contacts . The questionnaire for COVIMOD was based on the questionnaire of the CoMix study [ 4 , 6 ] being conducted across various European countries . It includes questions on demographics , current behaviours , attitudes towards SARS - CoV - 2 , and the social contacts of participants . A version of the questionnaire , translated from German , can be found in Additional File 1 . A contact in COVIMOD is defined as “people who you met in person and with whom you exchanged at least a few words , or with whom you had physical con - tact” , which is in line with the pre - pandemic contact survey POLYMOD [ 11 ] . Participants were asked to list each contact individually for the first two survey waves of COVIMOD . From wave 3 onwards , in addition to indi - vidual contacts , participants could give aggregate group contacts in each of three different settings ( work , school , and other ) , and for three contact age groups in each set - ting ( < 18 years , 18 to 64 years , 65 years or older ) . All COVIMOD participants were also asked whether they had used a mask or public transport the previous day . In addition , participants were asked about their vaccination status from survey wave 17 onwards . Page 3 of 11 Walde et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 205 The timing and the sample sizes of the 31 survey waves included in this study can be found in Additional File 2 , sheet 1 . POLYMOD and HaBIDS We used the pre - pandemic POLYMOD ( Improving Pub - lic Health POLicY in Europe through MODelling and Economic Evaluation of Interventions for the Control of Infectious Diseases ) and HaBIDS ( Hygiene and Behav - iour Infectious Diseases Survey ) studies to compare con - tact details from COVIMOD to pre - pandemic contact patterns . POLYMOD was a Europe - wide paper - based contact survey , conducted in Germany in 2005 / 2006 . HaBIDS was conducted between 2014 and 2017 and col - lected data on social contacts of people living in certain districts of Lower Saxony , Germany , using both online and paper - based surveys . Participants in POLYMOD and HaBIDS were given the option to report group contacts if they were too numerous to list individually ; however , this option was only provided for professional contacts . Further details on HaBIDS and POLYMOD can be found elsewhere [ 11 , 12 ] . Definition of the risk groups We considered two groups of participants at higher risk of a severe COVID - 19 outcome . First , all participants aged 65 and over were considered to be at increased risk due to their age . This risk will henceforth be called high ‘ age risk’ and correspondingly participants aged below 65 will be called the low age risk group . The second group consisted of participants with underlying health conditions that risk a severe course of COVID - 19 . During the first 13 COVIMOD survey waves , participants were asked if they belonged to a risk group for whom annual flu vaccinations are recommended ( due to a health condition ) . This included persons with chronic respiratory disease , chronic heart disease , chronic kidney disease , chronic liver disease , chronic neurological dis - ease , diabetes ( all types ) , immunosuppression ( disease - or treatment - related ) , asplenia or splenic dysfunction , grade III obesity ( BMI ≥ 40 ) , and pregnant women ( Additional File 1 ) . Throughout the manuscript we will refer to this as high risk due to underlying health conditions , or , when a shorter term is needed , as simply high ‘ health risk’ . From survey wave 14 onwards , this question was rephrased and asked if the participant was at either high or medium risk for a severe COVID - 19 outcome due to existing health conditions . Medium risk was defined as including one or more of the following : less severe lung disease ( such as asthma , COPD , emphysema , or bron - chitis ) , heart disease ( e . g . heart failure ) , diabetes , chronic kidney or liver disease , brain or nerve disease ( such as Parkinson’s disease , motor neuron disease , multiple sclerosis , or cerebral palsy ) , increased risk for infection , taking medications that can affect the immune system ( such as low - dose steroids ) , BMI of 40 or more , preg - nancy . High risk was defined as including one or more of the following : organ transplant , bone marrow or stem cell transplant in the past six months , current cancer treat - ment , blood or bone marrow cancer , severe lung disease ( such as cystic fibrosis , severe asthma , or severe COPD ) , a condition that increases the risk of infection ( such as SCID or sickle cell disease ) , immunosuppressive medica - tions or high dose steroids , pregnancy with a severe heart disease . For this study , we considered high and medium risk to be equivalent under the umbrella of high risk due to underlying conditions . Handling missing data Data about age risk ( i . e . data about the participant’s age or age group ) was missing in 0 . 05 % of COVIMOD responses , whereas data about health risk was missing in 8 % of COVIMOD responses , due to them not knowing or not being willing to give an answer to the relevant ques - tions . There were no missing data in the outcome vari - ables of daily number of contacts . For the age risk analysis , we decided to use a complete case analysis approach due to the very low proportion of missing data . It was often the case that data about participants’ health risk were missing from some survey waves but not others that they had also participated in . In this case , for each survey wave in which a participant had missing health risk status , we assigned them the health risk status from the temporally closest survey wave for which this information was not missing . After this procedure , we were left with 0 . 7 % of responses with missing health risk status ( due to it being missing from all relevant waves ) , and we removed these responses from the health risk analysis . Since health risk status could change over time , we also did a sensitivity analysis for the health risk analy - sis , using an approach where we removed missing data in any survey wave completely regardless of whether it was available in another survey wave , instead of using the procedure described above . Data management and statistical analysis Throughout this section , the participant refers to the person whose contacts were reported . All analyses were done using R version 4 . 1 . 1 [ 13 ] and Python 3 . 9 . 7 [ 14 ] . Participants in COVIMOD were asked to specify whether the contacts they reported were with house - hold members or not . The analyses were carried out twice , once using all reported contacts , and once using only contacts with non - household members , which could possibly be more useful for assessing the impact Page 4 of 11 Walde et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 205 of contact reduction measures . To prevent a few outliers with a large number of contacts from affecting the anal - yses , we decided to truncate the number of group con - tacts reported in each setting at 100 where necessary . For COVIMOD we calculated the bootstrapped mean and 95 % confidence intervals of the number of contacts per participant per survey wave split by risk status for participants stratified by both types of risk . To assess potential differences in contact patterns depending on risk status , we used negative binomial models with contacts as the independent variable , risk status and confounders ( varied according to the analyses being per - formed ) as explanatory variables . In R notation : In mathematical notation : where i represents an individual participant , j represents survey wave , 1 risk is an indicator function for whether participant i belongs to the high risk group , and X x are confounders ( varied according to the analyses being per - formed ) . The β are coefficients to be estimated , and ǫ ij is the residual term . We fit the models to our data using generalised esti - mating equations ( GEEs ) , to obtain population - averaged coefficients while taking into account autocorrelation due to repeated measures of the same participant . The exponentiated coefficient e β 1 then represents the popu - lation - averaged ratio of mean contacts in the high risk group to the low risk group . Thus , we will henceforth call it the overall ‘contact ratio’ for high risk . We used the ‘statsmodels’ package in Python [ 15 ] to fit the models . We used two ‘types’ of model in the analyses . Model 1 for both age risk and health risk included no con - founding variables , and we will refer to the contact ratios obtained from it as ‘unadjusted’ contact ratios . For model 2 for age risk , we included sex and house - hold size as confounding variables , since older people tend to live in smaller households than younger people . Similarly , certain age groups are more likely to be at high health risk than others , so we included sex and age group as confounding variables in model 2 for health risk . The contact ratios obtained from Model 2 will be called the ‘adjusted’ contact ratios . Lifting of restrictions The different COVIMOD survey waves took place under varying levels of contact restrictions in Germany . We contacts ∼ risk _ status + confounders Contacts i ∼ NegativeBinomial ( mean = 𝜇 i , heterogeneity = 𝛼 ) ln ( µ i ) = β 0 + β 1 1 risk ( i ) + x β x X xi + ǫ i identified five distinct ‘restriction phases’ in the duration of the analysed survey waves , based on chronologies of national - level restrictions in Germany [ 1 , 16 ] . First lockdown : COVIMOD waves 1 and 2 were con - ducted towards the tail end of the first lockdown in Ger - many , in the end of April and most of May 2020 . Relaxed measures : COVIMOD waves 3 to 12 were con - ducted when contact restriction measures were relaxed in Germany , from the end of May to the start of Novem - ber 2020 . This includes ‘transition’ periods at the start when restrictions were being eased gradually , and at the end when restrictions were slowly being put in place again as a response to the second wave of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . Second lockdown : The second SARS - CoV - 2 wave led to an increase in contact restrictions in Germany again , starting in November 2020 and eventually a second lock - down that lasted till mid - April 2021 , although schools and some businesses were allowed to reopen from the beginning of March 2021 . COVIMOD waves 13 to 20 were carried out during this period . Relaxed measures again : Restrictions were relaxed again once the second lockdown was lifted , and remained relaxed until late August . COVIMOD waves 21 to 25 were conducted during this time . Vaccination / Testing checks : COVIMOD waves 26 to 31 were carried out from September 2021 , when the so - called 3G , 2G , and 2G + rules were put in place in much of Germany . These restricted large parts of public life to people unless they had : 3G : Been vaccinated , recently tested negative for , or recently recovered from a SARS - CoV - 2 infection , 2G : Been vaccinated or recently recovered from a SARS - CoV - 2 infection , 2G + : Been vaccinated or recently recovered , AND recently tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 . These phases are similar to , but not the same as , the classification made by the Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) [ 17 , 18 ] ; the intensity of contact reduction measures was not the main consideration in the RKI’s classification . To establish whether COVIMOD participants responded differently to strict contact restriction meas - ures being lifted , we took an interrupted time series approach considering the lifting of lockdown as the interruption , using the negative binomial model schema below adapted from the framework described by Linden [ 19 ] : In R notation : In mathematical notation : contacts ∼ risk _ status ∗ wave + confounders Page 5 of 11 Walde et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 205 where the symbols mean the same as before , with the new indicator function 1 relaxed (cid:31) j (cid:30) indicating whether wave j occurred during a time of relaxed restriction measures . We excluded waves belonging to the ‘ Vaccination / Testing checks’ phase ( waves 26 onwards ) from this analysis , since the restrictions during these waves were neither at strict lockdown levels nor fully relaxed . A detailed interpretation of the regression coefficients from the above model schema can be found in the paper by Linden [ 19 ] ; here we are only concerned with β 5 . e β 5 represents the ( multiplicative ) change in the contact ratio for high risk from the lockdown phases to the relaxed measures phases i . e . it is a ratio of contact ratios . For this analysis too , we used two models for both the age risk and health risk analysis ; Time series 1 with no confounders , and Time series 2 with the confounders mentioned earlier for Model 2 . These models were also fit using GEEs to account for within - participant clustering . Comparison to POLYMOD and HaBIDS In POLYMOD , no information on underlying health conditions was collected , so POLYMOD was used only for the age risk comparison with COVIMOD . Similarly , in HaBIDS no participants older than 75 years were recruited , therefore HaBIDS was only included in the health risk comparison . For this purpose , we restricted COVIMOD participants to those between 15 and 75 years of age to match HaBIDS . The high health risk group in HaBIDS is made up of those participants who reported having a chronic condition , or currently being pregnant [ 12 ] , with participants for whom this data was missing being excluded . Furthermore , due to different definitions of group contacts in the surveys , it was not possible to truncate contacts from all three studies in the same way , so we chose to right - truncate the final number of contacts at 100 for the comparative analysis . The sample sizes for our HaBIDS ( N = 856 ) and POL - YMOD ( N = 1341 ) datasets were similar to that of one COVIMOD wave ( average N = 1761 . 4 , min . 739 , max . 2502 ) and did not have repeated measures . Therefore , to estimate contact ratios for high risk for these sur - veys , we used the models used for COVIMOD but with - out accounting for within - participant clustering . We used regression analyses to fit these models , using the ‘glm’ function from the MASS package in R [ 20 ] . Again , the 2 - model framework was used to estimate both Contacts ij ∼ NegativeBinomial ( mean = 𝜇 ij , heterogeneity = 𝛼 ) ln ( 𝜇 ij ) = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 1 risk ( i ) + 𝛽 2 j + 𝛽 3 1 relaxed ( j ) + 𝛽 4 1 risk ( i ) j + 𝛽 5 1 relaxed ( j ) 1 risk ( i ) + 𝛽 6 j 1 relaxed ( j ) + 𝛽 7 j 1 relaxed ( j ) 1 risk ( i ) + ∑ x 𝛽 x X xi + 𝜖 ij unadjusted and adjusted contact ratios for HaBIDS and POLYMOD separately . We compared these ratios to the overall contact ratios obtained from fitting the respective COVIMOD models to the modified COVIMOD data . Neither POLYMOD nor HaBIDS required their partici - pants to specify whether their contacts were with house - hold members or not , so an analysis concerning contacts only with non - household members was not possible . It has been reported that the day of the week , especially whether it is a weekend or a weekday , is a contributing factor to social contact behaviour , and it is common to weight contact survey data by day of reporting [ 21 ] . However , we found in descriptive analyses that the distri - bution of responses with respect to weekday or weekend was balanced in the high and low risk groups for both age and health risk ( between 20 and 22 % of responses made on a weekend in all groups ) , so we did not adjust or weight for this in our analyses . Furthermore , although we had data on whether COVIMOD participants were vac - cinated in the survey waves conducted after vaccinations became available ( survey wave 17 onwards ) , we believe that being unvaccinated due to vaccinations not being available would have a different impact on contact pat - terns than being unvaccinated when vaccinations were available , due to choice or vaccination prioritisation poli - cies . Therefore , we did not find it appropriate to adjust for vaccination status . Results Demography The first 31 COVIMOD survey waves had a total of 54 , 602 responses from 7 , 323 unique participants , who reported a total of 178 , 916 contacts including truncated group contacts . Of these , 54 , 570 responses were included in the age risk analysis , and 54 , 208 were included in the health risk analysis , with the others excluded due to missing information about their risk status . From POLY - MOD , 1 , 341 participants , who reported a total of 24 , 278 contacts after truncation , were assessed in this study , as well as 856 participants from the HaBIDS study who reported a total of 27 , 777 contacts . All of the included HaBIDS participants were from the online - based part of the survey . Between 43 and 49 % of the responses in the COVI - MOD waves were from female participants . Between 18 and 32 % were from participants at high risk for a severe COVID - 19 outcome due to their age ( age risk ) and between 35 and 40 % were from participants at risk for severe COVID - 19 due to underlying health conditions ( health risk ) . A detailed demographic table for COVI - MOD can be found in Additional File 2 , sheet 2 . In com - parison , 10 % of POLYMOD participants were at high risk Page 6 of 11 Walde et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 205 due to their age , and 15 % of the participants analysed from HaBIDS were at high risk due to underlying health conditions . Mean contacts Across all COVIMOD waves , participants reported a mean of 3 . 28 overall daily contacts ( with group contacts truncated , bootstrapped 95 % CI 3 . 20 , 3 . 35 ) . Participants at high health risk reported a mean of 2 . 87 ( 95 % CI 2 . 77 , 2 . 98 ) daily contacts , whereas those at low health risk reported a mean of 3 . 49 ( 95 % CI 3 . 38 , 3 . 60 ) daily contacts . Participants at high and low age risk reported a mean of 2 . 59 ( 95 % CI 2 . 49 , 2 . 70 ) and 3 . 52 ( 95 % CI 3 . 43 , 3 . 62 ) daily contacts respectively . Figure 1 below , and Tables A3 . 1 and A3 . 2 in Additional File 3 show the mean number of overall contacts and the mean number of contacts with non - household members stratified by risk group for each COVIMOD survey wave . In most waves , participants at high risk reported fewer contacts on average than participants at low risk . The difference was greatest in survey waves 4 and 5 , i . e . June 2020 , which happened during a period of relaxed contact restriction measures in Germany . Contact ratios Table 1 shows both the unadjusted and adjusted over - all contact ratios ( CRs ) for high risk for COVIMOD participants . In the unadjusted model , higher risk was associated with having fewer contacts , for both age risk and health risk ( All contact CRs 0 . 73 [ 95 % CI 0 . 66 , 0 . 81 ] for age risk , 0 . 82 [ 95 % CI 0 . 75 , 0 . 90 ] for health risk , non - household contact CRs 0 . 72 [ 95 % CI 0 . 62 , 0 . 83 ] and 0 . 84 [ 95 % CI 0 . 74 , 0 . 96 ] for age and health risk respectively ) . So , for example , the unadjusted ratios imply that COVI - MOD participants aged 65 and over reported on average 27 % fewer daily contacts than those younger than 65 . The association with high age risk remained after adjusting for participant sex and household size ( all contact CR 0 . 83 [ 95 % CI 0 . 74 , 0 . 92 ] , non - household contact CR 0 . 72 [ 95 % CI 0 . 62 , 0 . 83 ] ) , but the association with high health Fig . 1 Mean number of contacts reported by participants per COVIMOD wave , split by risk status . 95 % confidence intervals were obtained by bootstrapping . The x - axis represents midpoints of the period of data collection for the corresponding survey wave . Displayed are the mean overall number of contacts stratified by ( a ) whether the participant is aged over or under 65 ( high or low age risk ) , and ( b ) whether the participant is recommended to get an annual flu vaccination due to existing health conditions or not ( high or low health risk ) . The bottom row displays the mean number of contacts with non - household members , stratified by ( c ) age risk and ( d ) health risk status Page 7 of 11 Walde et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 205 risk disappeared after adjusting for participant sex and age group ( all contact CR 0 . 99 [ 95 % CI 0 . 90 , 1 . 09 ] , non - household contact CR 0 . 97 [ 95 % CI 0 . 86 , 1 . 10 ] ) . Response to lifting restrictions COVIMOD participants reported a mean of 2 . 60 ( 95 % CI 2 . 48 , 2 . 70 ) daily total contacts and 1 . 50 ( 95 % CI 1 . 39 , 1 . 61 ) daily non - household contacts in waves that occurred during the two lockdown phases , compared to a mean of 3 . 62 ( 95 % CI 3 . 50 , 3 . 75 ) and 2 . 56 ( 95 % CI 2 . 44 , 2 . 68 ) daily total and non - household contacts respectively in waves that occurred during the two ‘relaxed measures’ phases . Table 2 shows the estimated change in contact ratios for high risk from lockdown phases to relaxed phases . The unadjusted contact ratios for high age risk with respect to non - household contacts were smaller during periods of relaxed measures than during lockdown periods ( Ratio of CRs 0 . 72 [ 95 % CI 0 . 54 , 0 . 95 ] ) . This was also true but with wide confidence intervals spanning either side of 1 for the contact ratios regarding all contacts ( Ratio of CRs 0 . 87 [ 95 % CI 0 . 72 , 1 . 05 ] ) . This remained the case after adjust - ing for sex and household size ( Multiplicative factor 0 . 83 [ 95 % CI 0 . 71 , 1 . 05 ] for all contacts , 0 . 72 [ 95 % CI 0 . 54 , 0 . 95 ] for non - household contacts ) . The point estimates for the ratio of contact ratios for high health risk pointed towards lower contact ratios dur - ing periods of relaxed measure compared to lockdown periods , but confidence intervals were wide and spanning either side of 1 ( Ratio of CRs 0 . 92 [ 95 % CI 0 . 75 , 1 . 13 ] for all contacts , 0 . 79 [ 95 % CI 0 . 58 , 1 . 07 ] for non - household contacts ) . This remained true after adjusting for sex and age group ( Ratio of CRs 0 . 92 [ 95 % CI 0 . 76 , 1 . 13 ] and 0 . 80 [ 95 % CI 0 . 60 , 1 . 08 ] for all and non - household contacts respectively ) . Comparison to POLYMOD and HaBIDS 116 responses from COVIMOD ( 0 . 2 % ) required further truncation of grouped contacts to make them suitable for comparison compared to 49 HaBIDS responses ( 5 % ) , and 2 POLYMOD responses ( 0 . 1 % ) . For POLYMOD , after this truncation , people at high age risk reported a mean of 7 . 00 ( 95 % CI 5 . 62 , 8 . 52 ) contacts , compared to 19 . 55 ( 95 % CI 18 . 51 , 20 . 54 ) contacts for those at low risk . Comparatively , after this truncation , the mean contacts for high and low age risk in COVIMOD were 2 . 56 ( 95 % CI 2 . 47 , 2 . 66 ) and 3 . 44 ( 95 % CI 3 . 36 , 3 . 52 ) respectively . For comparison to HaBIDS , after excluding COVI - MOD participants outside the HaBIDS age range of 16 – 75 years and those for whom no data about health risk were available , we were left with 48 , 630 COVIMOD responses . Of these , 48 % were from female participants and 37 % from participants at increased risk due to under - lying health conditions ( health risk group ) . In HaBIDS , the mean number of contacts reported by people with an underlying health condition ( health risk group ) was 26 . 49 ( 95 % CI 21 . 65 , 31 . 80 ) , compared to 28 . 58 ( 95 % CI 26 . 71 , 30 . 42 ) for those at low risk . In COVIMOD on the other hand , the high health risk group ( in HaBIDS - compatible age groups ) reported a mean of 2 . 82 ( 95 % CI 2 . 72 , 2 . 93 ) contacts , compared to 3 . 20 ( 95 % CI 3 . 11 , 3 . 30 ) for the low health risk group . For the sake of completeness , the mean reported con - tacts and bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals by risk status for each COVIMOD wave after this truncation , and after further filtration for compatible age groups , can be found in Additional File 3 , Table A3 . 3 .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 205 Table 3 shows the estimated contact ratios for high risk status for POLYMOD , HaBIDS , and the overall contact ratios for the modified - for - comparison COVI - MOD data , without and with further adjusting varia - bles respectively . Both the unadjusted and adjusted ( for sex and household size ) models showed that high age risk was associated with fewer contacts in POLYMOD ( Unadjusted CR 0 . 36 [ 95 % CI 0 . 30 , 0 . 42 ] , adjusted CR 0 . 36 [ 95 % CI 0 . 30 , 0 . 43 ] ) . This effect was much stronger than that observed in the comparable COVIMOD data ( Unadjusted CR 0 . 74 [ 95 % CI 0 . 68 , 0 . 82 ] , adjusted CR 0 . 84 [ 95 % CI 0 . 76 , 0 . 92 ] ) . In HaBIDS , neither the unadjusted nor the adjusted ( for sex and age group ) contact ratios showed an asso - ciation between high health risk and differences in con - tact behaviour , but the confidence intervals were wide ( Unadjusted CR 0 . 93 [ 95 % CI 0 . 77 , 1 . 13 ] , adjusted CR 0 . 96 [ 95 % CI 0 . 80 , 1 . 16 ] ) . In the comparable COVIMOD dataset , the unadjusted analysis showed an association between high health risk and fewer contacts ( CR 0 . 88 [ 95 % CI 0 . 80 , 0 . 97 ] ) , which disappeared after adjusting for sex and age group ( CR 0 . 99 [ 95 % CI 0 . 91 , 1 . 09 ] ) . Sensitivity analysis for health risk We found that using an approach where we removed missing data from each survey wave regardless of whether it was available in other waves , instead of the ‘temporal imputation’ method described in the methods section , to handle missing data about health risk led to slight changes in the values of the mean contacts and contact ratios ( in particular , mean contacts were higher for both risk groups in the complete case analysis ) . How - ever , these differences were small and did not impact the interpretation of the results at all . Discussion Reductions in the contacts of the general population caused by the pandemic and implemented control meas - ures have been extensively studied [ 3 – 7 , 22 , 23 ] . The COVIMOD survey also shows that there has been a reduction in contacts throughout the German population during the pandemic , and in this study we further found that for most of the duration of the pandemic , people with high risk status had on average fewer contacts than people at lower risk ( See Fig . 1 , Additional File 3 tables A3 . 1 and A3 . 2 ) . It is already well - documented that elderly persons had fewer contacts than younger people , even before the pan - demic [ 24 , 25 ] . The pre - pandemic data we analysed from the POLYMOD survey corroborates this , and data from COVIMOD shows that this phenomenon remained dur - ing the pandemic , with elderly participants reporting fewer contacts than younger participants . Compared to pre - pandemic times , the difference in pandemic contact patterns between the high and low age risk groups ( i . e . Respectively the elderly and younger age groups ) was less stark . A possible explanation for this could be that the contact reduction measures employed during the pandemic have mainly been successful at reducing contacts in work and education settings , which reduces the younger population’s contacts dispropor - tionately more than elderly people’s contacts . This can be seen from the POLYMOD and COVIMOD data ; the work contacts of the elderly remain consistently low in both POLYMOD and all COVIMOD waves , but the work contacts of the younger individuals are much lower in the COVIMOD waves than in POLYMOD ( Additional File 3 Table A3 . 4 ) . Another possible explanation is that there was simply less scope for reduction in the elderly’s con - tacts , since they had much fewer contacts to begin with . Whatever the reason , this has implications for the para - metrisation of infectious disease models . Many mathe - matical models of the pandemic were parametrised using scaled - down pre - pandemic data [ 26 – 28 ] . Given the dif - ferences in age - stratified contact patterns betweeen pre - pandemic and pandemic times , such a uniform scaling down may not be appropriate . We found that participants at risk because of underly - ing health conditions ( health risk ) also reported fewer contacts during the pandemic compared to participants without this risk , as can be seen from Fig . 1 and the unadjusted contact ratios in Table 1 . However , the mag - nitude of this effect was lower compared to that due to age risk , as illustrated in Table 1 . Furthermore , given that , after adjusting for age and sex , the effect disappeared , there is no evidence that this reduction is associated with high health risk itself , and it is likely associated with the confounding effect of age instead . Table 3 Comparison of contact ratios for high risk before and during the pandemic Table 3 : Contacts were right - truncated at 100 for this analysis . COVIMOD estimates were obtained by running the same models as before on the dataset modified to be compatible with HaBIDS and POLYMOD . Pre - pandemic estimates were obtained by a negative binomial regression analysis . When other adjusting variables were used , they were sex and household size for the age risk analysis , and sex and age group for the health risk analysis Unadjusted Contact Ratio ( 95 % CI ) Adjusted Contact Ratio ( 95 % CI ) Health risk Pre - pandemic ( HaBIDS ) 0 . 93 ( 0 . 77 , 1 . 13 ) 0 . 96 ( 0 . 80 , 1 . 16 ) Pandemic ( COVIMOD ) 0 . 88 ( 0 . 80 , 0 . 97 ) 0 . 99 ( 0 . 91 , 1 . 09 ) Age risk Pre - pandemic ( POLYMOD ) 0 . 36 ( 0 . 30 , 0 . 42 ) 0 . 36 ( 0 . 30 , 0 . 43 ) Pandemic ( COVIMOD ) 0 . 74 ( 0 . 68 , 0 . 82 ) 0 . 84 ( 0 . 76 , 0 . 92 ) Page 9 of 11 Walde et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2023 ) 23 : 205 We did not find a strong association between health risk status and differences in contact behaviour in pre - pandemic data from HaBIDS , in either the unadjusted or adjusted analyses . Although we did find such an asso - ciation in the unadjusted analysis in COVIMOD , the overlapping confidence intervals mean that it is unclear whether there were changes in this effect from pre - pan - demic to pandemic times . We also found evidence of differential responses to the lifting of strict contact restriction measures ( i . e . lock - down ) based on age risk status . The average number of contacts of both the high and low risk groups increased in the survey waves immediately after restrictions were lifted or relaxed ( Fig . 1 ) , but the high age risk group increased their non - household contacts less than the low age risk group ( as indicated by the change in con - tact ratios in Table 3 ) . The picture for health risk is , once again , less clear , as is the picture for age risk when con - sidering all contacts ; the wide confidence intervals point , at best , to weak evidence to the presence of a differen - tial response in these cases . Further study is needed to understand if people reacted differently to the lifting of strict contact restriction measures based on individual risk status . Although various quotas were put in place for recruit - ment to the COVIMOD participant pool to ensure that the distribution of sociodemographic characteristics matched that of the German population as closely as pos - sible , middle aged individuals with young children were underrepresented because many such individuals took up the option of filling in the survey as a proxy for their children , instead of with their own information . Further - more , it cannot be ruled out that the people inclined to take part in a survey relating to public health would also be more inclined to adhere more closely to infection pre - vention measures , and this is a potential source of bias . Lastly , the participant pool might not have been repre - sentative of the German population with regards to epi - demiological characteristics even if it was representative with regards to sociodemographic ones . Details about other sources of bias in COVIMOD , for example survey fatigue from participants taking part in multiple waves , and what steps were taken to mitigate these biases , can be found elsewhere [ 7 ] . The COVIMOD questionnaire also changed over the 31 waves , the most prominent change being the addition of group contacts from survey wave 3 onwards . The lower contacts seen in the first two survey waves could be an artefact of this change . Although we cannot know for sure , it is likely that the inability to give group contacts would affect the group that would have a higher number of contacts dis - proportionately more than the other . This would mean that we would underestimate the magnitude of any differences in contact behaviour in these waves . Given that this was only the case for the first 2 waves , however , it likely had little to no impact on the overall estimates . All 3 surveys analysed in this paper were held in dif - fering time periods and had different participant pools . Furthermore , they had very different sample sizes and used different means of data collection—POLYMOD was paper - based , with participants encouraged to carry the booklets with them and record contacts as they hap - pened , HaBIDS was a mix of online and paper - based data collection although only participants from the online survey were analysed in this study , and COVI - MOD was completely online . There is evidence to show that contact reporting remains consistent between online and mixed - mode surveys [ 29 ] , but participants are likely to report more contacts in paper - based sur - veys than online ones [ 30 ] . It should be noted that this is contrary to our pre - pandemic data ; the analysed POLY - MOD participants reported on average around 18 con - tacts , while the analysed HaBIDS participants reported an average of around 32 . This is unlikely to have an effect on comparisons of reported contact behaviour of dif - ferent groups within a single survey , but makes cross - survey comparisons less clear . In addition , the group contacts assessed in POLYMOD ( as well as HaBIDS ) only include contacts met at work . Since the elderly are less likely to have a lot of work contacts , it cannot be ruled out that the difference in the number of contacts of older participants compared to younger participants in POLYMOD has been overestimated . Furthermore , the definitions of health risk in HaBIDS and COVIMOD are not an exact match ; therefore , the results regarding per - sons with underlying health conditions should be inter - preted with caution . Conclusion We found that people at higher risk of developing a severe outcome from a SARS - CoV - 2infection due to age or an underlying health condition had , on a population level , fewer daily contacts during the pandemic than people at lower risk . Interestingly , the difference in the number of contacts between people at higher risk due to old age and those not was smaller during the pandemic than before . Furthermore , persons at higher risk due to their age increased their contacts less than those not when contact restriction measures were lifted . These dif - ferences should be taken into account when parametris - ing infectious disease models in pandemic settings . However , the population - level differences observed within the subpopulation at higher risk due to underly - ing health conditions compared to those at lower risk were likely due to other factors and had no association with risk status itself .
