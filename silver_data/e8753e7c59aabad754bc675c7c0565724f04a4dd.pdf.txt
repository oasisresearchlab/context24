A socioeconomically diverse sample of ﬁrst - and second - generation Chinese American immigrant children between ages 7 and 10 ( n = 223 ) was administered assessments of Chinese and English language proﬁciencies and a multi - method , multi - informant battery of self - regulation measures . Multiple regression analyses suggested that controlling for covariates ( child age , gender , and SES ) , children’s bilingualism - related advantages were limited to higher performance only on computerized tasks of cognitive ﬂexibility , and only among children with higher degrees of ﬂuency in both Chinese and English . By contrast , proﬁciencies in one language ( either Chinese or English ) were uniquely and positively associated with other domains of self - regulation , including parent and teacher - reported effortful control . These results suggest that the bilingual advantage for self - regulation may be observed as a continuous variable among immigrant children with varying levels of bilingual ﬂuency ; however , this advantage may not extend across all domains and contexts of self - regulation . , Keywords : bilingualism , self - regulation , immigrant children INTRODUCTION Though previous research suggests that bilingual experience may confer advantages for children’s executive functioning ( see Bialystok et al . , 2009 , for a review ) , recent ﬁndings indicate mixed support for the “bilingual advantage” ( Antón et al . , 2014 ; Gathercole et al . , 2014 ; Pelham and Abrams , 2014 ) . A more nuanced understanding of the bilingual advantage may be achieved by examining two questions that to - date remain largely unexplored . The ﬁrst is whether bilingual advantages in exec - utive functioning can be observed as a continuous variable . That is , among children who are bilingual or learning two lan - guages , is executive functioning related to the degree of dual language proﬁciency ? Second , previous research on the bilin - gual advantage has been limited largely to laboratory - based tasks of executive functioning . Can bilingualism - related advantages also be found in other domains of self - regulation ( e . g . , effort - ful control ) or in other contexts ( e . g . , home and school ) ? We investigated these questions using a sample of Chinese American immigrant children . Speciﬁcally , we tested : ( a ) whether English and Chinese proﬁciency uniquely predict higher self - regulation among English - Chinese bilingual children , and ( b ) whether English and Chinese proﬁciency interact with each other in predicting children’s self - regulation . Executive function refers to higher - order , self - regulatory cog - nitive processes that aid in the monitoring and control of thought and action ( Zelazo and Cunningham , 2007 ) . Research to date on bilingualism - related advantages in children’s executive func - tion has operationalized “bilingualism” primarily as a categorical variable , and has compared bilingual children with monolin - gual peers on measures of executive function . One important limitation of the between - groups design is that classifying bilin - gual children into a single group masks the heterogeneity within the bilingual population . Children exposed to and learning two languages ( i . e . , dual language learners , or DLL ) have consider - able variability in their development of L1 and L2 ( Hammer et al . , 2011 , 2014 ) . For example , research with Cantonese - English bilinguals has shown large individual variation in language and early literacy measures for both children’s home language ( L1 ; Cantonese ) and their school language ( L2 ; English ) ( Uchikoshi and Marinova - Todd , 2012 ; Uchikoshi , 2013 ) . This variation has led to differences in scores of more than one standard devia - tion , especially in their L1 Cantonese . This variation may be due to home language use , as well as supplemental instruction through bilingual programs or Saturday heritage language schools ( Leung and Uchikoshi , 2012 ; Uchikoshi and Marinova - Todd , 2012 ; Uchikoshi , 2013 ) . Indeed , researchers have suggested that truly balanced bilin - guals ( i . e . , individuals with equal competence in both languages ) are rare , and that bilingual proﬁciency is more accurately rep - resented on a continuum ( Valdés , 2001 ) . Some researchers have www . frontiersin . org September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 1069 | 1 Chen et al . Immigrant children’s bilingualism and self - regulation used a more nuanced approach to assess proﬁciencies in both lan - guages , and quantify bilingualism as multiplicative terms of these proﬁciencies ( Carlisle et al . , 1999 ; San Francisco et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , by assessing and analyzing language proﬁciency as continu - ous variables , it is possible to examine the more complex relations between bilingualism and executive function . First , one can test whether proﬁciency in two languages uniquely relates to efﬁcien - cies in executive functioning . Because research has shown that proﬁciencies in two languages are correlated with each other in complex ways among bilingual children or DLLs ( Hammer et al . , 2014 ) , it remains unknown whether proﬁciency in each language uniquely contributes to efﬁciency in executive function skills . Second , testing the interactive relation between two languages allows researchers to study whether children’s executive function skills are related to their proﬁciency in L1 and L2 . For example , do bilingual children who are proﬁcient in both languages ( i . e . , bal - anced bilinguals ) show higher executive function than those who are proﬁcient in only one language ( e . g . , L1 - dominant bilinguals , or L2 - dominant bilinguals ) ? Previous work on the bilingual advantage in executive func - tion has primarily used lab - based cognitive measures , and there have been a number of ﬁndings that support bilingual children performing better on these tasks compared to monolingual chil - dren . Compared to monolingual children , balanced bilinguals performed signiﬁcantly better on executive function tasks that require inhibiting distracting information ( interference suppres - sion ) , switching between tasks , working memory , or coordinating different executive control skills ( Carlson and Meltzoff , 2008 ; Martin - Rhee and Bialystok , 2008 ; Bialystok , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2011 ) . This advantage has been attributed to bilinguals’ man - agement of ongoing linguistic experience , which involves the constant recruitment of control processes to maintain focus on the language in current use while temporarily inhibiting access to the other language . The constant need to exercise executive func - tion , in turn , is hypothesized to contribute to enhancement in these cognitive skills over time ( Bialystok et al . , 2009 ) . What remains unknown is whether the bilingual advantage on children’s executive function skills can also be observed in other domains of children’s self - regulation , namely , the regulation of emotion and behavior in natural contexts such as home and school . Recent theoretical and empirical work has suggested that executive function shares commonalities in its conceptualization , measurement , and neural structure with the temperament - based construct of effortful control . Effortful control refers to the vol - untary inhibition of a prepotent , dominant response in order to activate a subdominant response ( Rothbart and Bates , 2006 ; Blair and Razza , 2007 ; Zhou et al . , 2012 ) . Both executive function and effortful control can be conceptualized as self - regulatory pro - cesses associated with goal - directed behavior , and studies using both effortful control and executive function measures have sug - gested that these measures are modestly correlated and load on a common factor of self - regulation ( Blair and Razza , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2014 ) . However , while executive function has been conceptualized as involving primarily cognitive processes , and is typically measured using laboratory - based measures , effortful control is conceptualized as including more emotional regula - tory processes , and is commonly assessed with parents’ reports , teachers’ reports , or tasks requiring behavioral persistence ( Blair and Razza , 2007 ) . There are reasons to expect that DLLs may exhibit higher self - regulation beyond laboratory contexts . For example , it is pos - sible that the attentional processes enhanced through bilingual experience may also be used to maintain focus in both home and classroom settings . Likewise , the ability to cognitively inhibit distracting information may also be taxed on behavioral tasks requiring persistence in the face of temptation . It is also possible that the effects of bilingualism may extend beyond purely cognitive processes of executive function to more socioemotional processes involved in effortful control . Though we are unaware of research to - date speciﬁcally examining effects of bilingualism on effortful control , research with bicultural individuals suggests that switching regularly between cultural frames of reference allows one to adapt readily to changing social contexts and situations , and to develop more complex and nuanced representations of culture and the self ( Benet - Martínez et al . , 2002 , 2006 ; Nguyen and Benet - Martínez , 2013 ) . This higher self - complexity among bicultural individuals , in turn , has been theorized to buffer against negative stressors and emo - tional states ( Linville , 1985 ; Yip , 2009 ) . In support of this theory , a recent study by Yip ( 2009 ) indicated that among Chinese American undergraduates , simultaneous salience of both Chinese and American identities was associated with increased positive mood . Thus , as a form of biculturalism , bilingual experience may provide DLLs with increased adaptability and self - regulation in response to socioemotional stressors . Alternatively , it is possible that higher self - regulation in these domains may be inﬂuenced by higher proﬁciency in one , rather than multiple , languages . Speciﬁcally , in the present study , chil - dren’s higher Chinese proﬁciency may reﬂect greater orientation toward Chinese culture and its expectations of behavioral con - trol and self - restraint , and may therefore be reﬂected in higher self - regulation across different domains ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Jose et al . , 2000 ; Luo et al . , 2013 ) . In support of this hypothesis , children from East Asian countries have been found to outper - form European American children on tasks of executive function ( Sabbagh et al . , 2006 ; Oh and Lewis , 2008 ; Lan et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , Asian - English bilinguals have been found to outper - form Spanish - English and French - English bilinguals on tasks of attentional control ( Yang and Lust , 2007 ) . Taken together , examination of the bilingual advantage in DLLs must consider both the interactive and unique effects of language proﬁciencies across different domains of self - regulation . First - and second - generation Chinese American immigrant chil - dren are an ideal sample in which to examine the relations between bilingualism and self - regulation . Chinese Americans are the largest subgroup of Asian Americans ( 23 . 5 % of the Asian American population ) and one of the fastest growing foreign - born populations in the United States ( Pew Research Center . , 2012 ) . Moreover , Chinese American children have vary - ing degrees of proﬁciency in English and Chinese ( Leung and Uchikoshi , 2012 ; Uchikoshi and Marinova - Todd , 2012 ) . For example , one study using cluster analysis found four dis - tinct groups of young bilinguals : ( a ) children who had sim - ilar levels of English and Chinese vocabulary—i . e . , balanced Frontiers in Psychology | Language Sciences September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 1069 | 2 Chen et al . Immigrant children’s bilingualism and self - regulation bilinguals ; ( b ) higher English vocabulary and lower Chinese vocabulary ( English - dominant ) ; ( c ) high English vocabulary and high Cantonese vocabulary—so - called “ideal bilinguals” ; and ( d ) higher Cantonese vocabulary and lower English vocabulary ( Cantonese - dominant ) ( Leung and Uchikoshi , 2012 ) . Moreover , previous research indicates that only 16 . 1 % of second - generation immigrant youth are highly proﬁcient in their family’s her - itage language , and 72 . 3 % prefer speaking in English com - pared to their family’s heritage language ( Portes and Hao , 1998 ) . The present study tested the unique and interactive relations of Chinese American immigrant children’s Chinese and English proﬁciencies to their self - regulation assessed by a multi - method battery . As some researchers have argued that SES and ethnicity are potential confounds in the associations between bilingualism and executive function ( Morton and Harper , 2007 ) , we exam - ined the relations between bilingualism and self - regulation in a single - ethnicity sample of immigrant children , and controlled for family SES in the analyses . Based on the literature on the bilingual advantage in children’s executive control ( Bialystok , 2011 ) , we hypothesized that proﬁciency in two languages would additively and interactively predict higher self - regulatory skills controlling for family SES and child demographics ( age and gender ) . Given traditional emphasis of Chinese culture on children’s behavioral control and self - restraint ( Luo et al . , 2013 ) , we also expected that children’s higher Chinese proﬁciency would be uniquely associ - ated with their self - regulatory skills . Consistent with integrated models of self - regulation ( Zhou et al . , 2012 ; Chen et al . , 2014 ) , we also hypothesized that these associations would be observed across domains ( executive function and effortful control ) and contexts ( laboratory , home , and school ) of self - regulation . METHODS PARTICIPANTS Children were selected from a larger longitudinal study of Chinese American immigrant families in the Western United States . Children were either ﬁrst - generation ( born outside of the United States ) or second - generation immigrants ( born in the United States to at least one foreign - born parent ) . Data for the present study were collected at the second wave of the longitudinal assess - ment , when children ( n = 239 ) were between 7 and 10 years of age . To exclude monolingual Chinese or English speakers from the present sample , children were excluded from the present analyses if they : ( a ) scored more than one standard deviation below stan - dard mean scores on a standardized test of English reading skills , or ( b ) were unable to identify at least one item on a test of Chinese receptive vocabulary ( PPVT - R in Chinese ; Lu and Liu , 1998 ) . Children were administered the Basic Reading Skills Cluster of the Woodcock - Johnson Tests of Achievement , 3rd Edition ( WJ - III ) , which consists of the Letter - Word Identiﬁcation ( naming and reading words from a list ) and Word Attack subtests ( reading non - words ) . Children who scored more than one standard devi - ation below the mean score on the WJ - III were excluded from analyses ( n = 1 ) . Children were also administered the Chinese version of the Peabody - Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised ( Lu and Liu , 1998 ) . Fourteen tests were invalid due to administration errors , and children who were unable to identify at least one item were excluded from analyses ( n = 1 ) . The resulting sample included 223 Chinese American immi - grant children , of whom 23 . 3 % were ﬁrst generation and 76 . 7 % were second - generation immigrants . Approximately half ( 48 . 9 % ) of the children were girls . Children ranged from 7 . 49 to 10 . 96 years of age ( M = 9 . 18 , SD = 0 . 74 ) . Almost all participating par - ents ( 80 . 3 % mothers ) were born outside of the United States : 74 . 0 % of parents were born in mainland China , 8 . 5 % were born in Hong Kong , 3 . 1 % were born in Taiwan , and 12 . 1 % were born in other parts of the world . Participating parents’ years of for - mal education ranged from 2 to more than 20 years ( Doctorate or other advanced degree ) . On average , participating parents had completed some post - secondary education ( M = 13 . 22 years , SD = 2 . 87 ) . Families’ household per capita income was calcu - lated by dividing the estimated total family income for the past year by the number of individuals living in the household ( Datta and Meerman , 1980 ) . Families’ per capita income ranged from $ 1000 to over $ 33 , 750 ( M = $ 11 , 841 . 49 , SD = $ 8309 . 48 ) . More than half the children in the present sample ( 57 . 3 % ) were eligible for free or reduced school lunch based on family income . PROCEDURES All participants were treated in accordance with ethical stan - dards of APA . All procedures were approved by the University of California , Berkeley’s Institutional Review Board and the Committee on the Protection of Human Subjects . Following informed consent procedures , the child and the participating par - ent participated in a 2 . 5 - h laboratory assessment , which included structured interviews , questionnaires , cognitive and behavioral tasks , and tests of academic achievement . All questionnaires and tests were administered in the parent’s or child’s preferred lan - guage ( English , Mandarin , or Cantonese ) indicated at the begin - ning of the visit . All written materials , including consent and assent forms and questionnaires , were available in English , sim - pliﬁed Chinese , or traditional Chinese . The majority of parents ( 82 . 5 % ) completed the questionnaires in Chinese . All children in the present sample completed the assessment in English . At the end of the laboratory visit , parents were paid $ 50 and reimbursed for transportation , and children were given a small prize . At the end of data collection , a brief written feedback report was mailed to the parent , summarizing the child’s performance on academic test and his / her overall emotional and behavioral adjustment , based on parent’s and teacher’s ratings on standardized instru - ments . After obtaining the parent’s written permission , the child’s main classroom teacher was contacted by the research staff and asked to complete a set of questionnaires on the child’s behaviors at school . Teacher questionnaires were sent and returned via mail , and teachers were paid $ 20 . 00 for completing the questionnaires for each child . Teacher questionnaires were collected for 87 . 0 % of children . MEASURES We used a variety of laboratory tasks ( observed behavioral mea - sures , computerized tasks ) , parent questionnaires , and teacher questionnaires to assess four components of children’s self - regulation : behavioral regulation , attention focusing , inhibitory www . frontiersin . org September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 1069 | 3 Chen et al . Immigrant children’s bilingualism and self - regulation control , and cognitive ﬂexibility . Children’s Chinese and English vocabularies were assessed through three laboratory assessments . Puzzle box test of behavioral regulation Children’s behavioral regulation was assessed via their perfor - mance on a task in which they were required to assemble a puzzle without looking ( Eisenberg et al . , 2001 , 2005 ) . Children were pre - sented with a wooden puzzle placed inside a large wooden box . The back of the box was covered with clear Plexiglas through which children’s hand movements could be observed . The front of the box was covered by a black cloth , and the cloth had sleeves through which the children placed their arms . Although the cloth blocked the child’s view of the puzzle , children were shown that they could easily “peek” during the task by lifting the cloth , but were instructed not to do so . Children were told that they had 5 min to complete the puzzle without looking , and were told that they would receive a prize for completing the puzzle . Children were left alone in the room for up to 5 min while completing the task and were videotaped by a visible video camera . Two trained undergraduate students independently coded the videos for the number of seconds the child persisted on the puz - zle without cheating or going off - task ( inter - rater r = 0 . 97 in this sample ) . Children’s behavioral persistence was calculated as the proportion of time persisting on the task ( i . e . , time persist - ing divided by the total time spent on the puzzle , see Eisenberg et al . , 2001 ) . In a longitudinal study of predominantly European American children , the behavioral persistence score on this task showed satisfactory rank order stability from middle to late child - hood and loaded positively on the latent factor of effortful control together with parent and teacher report of attention focusing and inhibitory control ( Eisenberg et al . , 2005 ) . Computerized tests of response inhibition and cognitive ﬂexibility Response inhibition has been conceptualized as the ability to refrain from a prepotent or automatically - cued response , while interference suppression involves attending to a relevant cue while ﬁltering out irrelevant and potentially conﬂicting cues ( Bunge et al . , 2002 ) . Bilinguals have been shown to outperform mono - linguals on tests of interference suppression , but no consistent advantages have been observed for tasks of response inhibition ( Bialystok et al . , 2006 ; Costa et al . , 2008 ) . Response inhibition task . Children performed a computerized Go / No - Go task ( Eriksen and Eriksen , 1974 ) designed for use in children . Children were presented with a series of images of car - toon characters from a popular animated children’s ﬁlm , and were instructed to press a button quickly in response to the appearance of a target stimulus , and to refrain from pressing the button in response to the appearance of a non - target stimulus . The stim - uli were presented for 2 s each at consistent intervals . Designation of cartoons as either target or non - target stimuli were counter - balanced for each child . During an initial instructional phase consisting of 30 trials , the experimenter provided correctional feedback if the child made an error in responding . In the sub - sequent testing phase , no feedback was provided . Each testing phase consisted of 200 target / Go trials and 50 non - target / No - Go trials . Data from the testing phase were submitted for analysis . Previous research has suggested that a low rate of omission errors , i . e . , failing to press the button in response to the target stimulus , on similar tasks reﬂect sustained attention , while a high rate of commission errors , i . e . , responding to non - target stimuli , reﬂect disinhibition or impulsivity ( Halperin et al . , 1988 ; Barkley , 1991 ) . Cognitive ﬂexibility task . Children were administered a comput - erized task that required them to use , on a trial - by - trial basis , one of two visually presented rule cues ( “Color” or “Direction” ) to determine the appropriate response for a given target stimulus ( Baym et al . , 2008 ) . Target stimuli were cartoons from a popular animated children’s ﬁlm . Color and Direction trials were ran - domly ordered . On Direction trials , children were instructed to press a left button in response to an arrow that pointed to the left of the screen , and a right button for an arrow that pointed to the right . On Color trials , half of the children were taught that a red stimulus indicated a left - button press and a blue stimulus indicated a right button press , and half were taught the reverse stimulus - response mapping . Trials involved either Incongruent features , in which the color and direction required different responses ( e . g . , a left - facing stimulus in a color associated with a right - button press ) , or Congruent features , in which the color and direction required the same response ( e . g . , a left - facing stim - ulus in a color associated with a left - button press ) . Finally , rules for each trial ( i . e . , Color or Direction ) were either the same as on the preceding trial ( “Repeat” ) or different from the preceding trial ( “Switch” ) . To ensure that they understood the directions of the task , chil - dren participated in a short practice session ( 32 trials ) followed by a testing session ( 98 trials ) . On each trial , an instructional cue ( “Color” or “Direction” ) appeared for 2300 ms , followed by a target stimulus for 1500 ms . Children were required to press the appropriate button while the target stimulus was displayed . If a child responded incorrectly to a stimulus during the prac - tice session , the experimenter would pause the task and remind the child of the correct response . No feedback was given to the child during the testing session . Data was missing for one child on this task due to a computer malfunction . For the present study , proportion correct [ 100 ∗ ( # of correct trials / # of total trials ) ] on Incongruent - Switch trials ( 24 total trials ) was used as a measure of cognitive ﬂexibility . As measured by this task , cognitive ﬂexibil - ity is a more speciﬁc type of interference suppression , as accurate performance on these trials requires suppression of the previously relevant stimulus dimension ( i . e . , interference suppression ) , as well as ﬂexible switching from one rule to another ( Baym et al . , 2008 ) . Parent and teacher questionnaires The child’s participating parent and main classroom teacher com - pleted Attention Focusing and Inhibitory Control subscales of the Children’s Behavior Questionnaire ( CBQ ; Rothbart et al . , 2001 ) . Items were rated on a 7 - point scale ranging from 1 ( extremely untrue ) to 7 ( extremely true ) . Parent and teacher reports of the two CBQ subscales have been used previously with both European American and Chinese children , and have shown satisfactory internal and test - retest reliabilities in both European American and native Chinese children ( Eisenberg et al . , 2005 ; Zhou et al . , Frontiers in Psychology | Language Sciences September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 1069 | 4 Chen et al . Immigrant children’s bilingualism and self - regulation 2008 ) . Moreover , cross - cultural comparisons between Chinese and US samples showed cross - cultural similarities in the relations of attention focusing and inhibitory control ( Zhou et al . , 2009 ) . In the present sample , the alphas for parent and teacher - rated inhibitory control ( 11 items ) were 0 . 74 and 0 . 81 , respectively ; the alphas for parent and teacher - rated attention focusing ( 12 items ) were 0 . 77 and 0 . 88 , respectively . Inhibitory control and attention focusing are two theoretically related components of effortful control ( Rothbart and Bates , 2006 ) . Within the present sample , the inhibitory control and attention focusing subscale scores were moderately to highly correlated within reporters , r s = 0 . 65 and 0 . 71 ( N s = 216 and 192 ) , for parents’ and teachers’ reports , respectively , p s < 0 . 001 . Thus , following procedures used in previous studies ( Olson et al . , 2005 ) , an effortful control com - posite was computed by averaging the item scores across the two subscales . Laboratory tests of language proﬁciency Chinese language proﬁciency . Two measures were used to assess children’s proﬁciency in Chinese receptive vocabulary and Chinese character recognition . To assess children’s receptive vocabulary , children were administered the Chinese version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised ( Lu and Liu , 1998 ) . To assess children’s proﬁciency in Chinese character recognition , children were presented with a sheet containing 20 Chinese char - acters of increasing complexity , and asked to identify as many words as they could ( Gottardo et al . , 2001 , 2006 ) . The items are commonly used in texts encountered by beginning read - ers . Characters were presented in both traditional and simpliﬁed Chinese characters . Children were given one point for each cor - rect response , for a maximum of 20 points . Children were given partial credit ( 0 . 5 points ) if they were unable to provide the Chinese pronunciation for the character , but were able to provide the correct English meaning . English proﬁciency . The Basic Reading Skills cluster from the Woodcock - Johnson III Tests of Achievement III ( WJ III ; Woodcock et al . , 2001 ) was used to assess children’s English proﬁ - ciency . The Basic Reading Skills cluster consists of two subtests : Letter - Word Identiﬁcation ( naming and reading words from a list ) and Word Attack ( the ability to read non - words ) . The WJ III is standardized with a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 . The age - standardized scores were used in the analyses . RESULTS Analyses were conducted in the following steps . First , all study variables were screened for normality . Second , zero - order correlations were used to examine associations between demo - graphic variables , Chinese and English language proﬁciencies , and separate measures of self - regulation across laboratory , home , and classroom contexts . Finally , multiple regression analyses were used to examine the unique and interactive associations between children’s Chinese and English proﬁciencies and components of self - regulation . DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS Descriptive statistics for all main variables are listed in Table 1 . All variables were screened for normality . Based on recommended cutoffs of two and seven for skewness and kurtosis , respectively ( West et al . , 1995 ) , one variable was positively skewed ( most participants made few errors of omission on the response inhibi - tion task ) , whereas another variable was negatively skewed ( most participants showed high levels of behavioral persistence on the puzzle box task ) . Given the presence of non - normal variables , we conducted the regression analyses using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors ( Muthén and Muthén , 1998 ) . ZERO - ORDER CORRELATIONS Zero - order correlations among main variables are reported in Table 2 . Family SES was computed as a composite score by ﬁrst averaging maternal and paternal education levels and then averaging the standardized scores of parental education and fam - ily per capita income . Some associations were found between demographic characteristics and main variables . Older children performed better on some measures of self - regulation ( e . g . , fewer commission errors , r = − 0 . 15 , p < 0 . 05 , better behavioral regulation , r = 0 . 29 , p < 0 . 001 ) and tests of Chinese proﬁ - ciency ( r s between 0 . 25 and 0 . 27 , p s < 0 . 001 ) . However , older children received lower age - standardized English reading scores ( r = − 0 . 23 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Higher family SES was associated with better English literacy ( r = 0 . 22 , p < 0 . 01 ) and higher parent - rated effortful control ( r = 0 . 17 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Finally , boys exhib - ited worse performance than girls on most tests of self - regulation ( r s between − 0 . 13 and − 0 . 41 , p s < 0 . 05 to < 0 . 001 ) . Given these associations , child age , family SES , and child gender were included as covariates in the main analyses . Table 1 | Descriptive statistics of main variables .

Overall , zero - order correlations also indicated that children’s English and Chinese proﬁciencies were both associated with bet - ter self - regulation , though these associations varied across speciﬁc measures . Children’s English literacy was associated with fewer omission errors on the response inhibition task ( r = − 0 . 23 , p < 0 . 01 ) and higher parent and teacher ratings of effortful control ( r s between 0 . 23 and 0 . 36 , p s < 0 . 01 to < 0 . 001 ) . On the other hand , Chinese literacy was associated with fewer commission errors on the response inhibition task ( r = − 0 . 21 , p < 0 . 01 ) and higher teacher - reported effortful control ( r = 0 . 19 and 0 . 15 , p s < 0 . 01 ) . Finally , children’s receptive Chinese vocabulary was associated with better behavioral regulation on the puzzle task ( r = 0 . 21 , p < 0 . 01 ) , better cognitive ﬂexibility ( r = − 0 . 14 , p < 0 . 01 ) , and better parent and teacher - rated attention focusing and inhibitory control ( r s between 0 . 15 and 0 . 22 , p s < 0 . 10 to < 0 . 01 ) . Zero - order correlations also indicated a number of positive associations among measures of self - regulation . With the excep - tion of correlations between parent - reported measures ( r = 0 . 65 , p < 0 . 001 ) and between teacher - reported measures ( r = 0 . 71 , p < 0 . 001 ) , associations among self - regulation measures were in the weak to moderate range ( r s between 0 . 15 and 0 . 33 ) , sug - gesting that measures represented interrelated but dissociable components of self - regulation . MULTIPLE REGRESSIONS : PREDICTING SELF - REGULATION MEASURES FROM CHINESE PROFICIENCY , ENGLISH PROFICIENCY , AND THEIR INTERACTIONS Six multiple regression models were speciﬁed to predict each of the six self - regulation measures ( including four lab measures and two adult - reported measures ) from the following predic - tors : ( a ) the covariates ( child age , child gender , and family SES ) , ( b ) Chinese receptive vocabulary , Chinese literacy , and English literacy , and ( c ) the interactions between Chinese proﬁciency and English proﬁciency : Chinese receptive vocabulary × English literacy and Chinese literacy × English literacy . To minimize mul - ticollinearity and aid interpretation ( Aiken and West , 1991 ) , the main effect predictors of language proﬁciency were mean centered prior to computing the interaction terms . Because of the presence of non - normal variables , the regres - sion models were estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Robust ( MLR ) estimator in Mplus 6 . 12 ( Muthén and Muthén , 1998 ) . Missing data were handled using the full information maximum likelihood ( FIML ) estimation approach . The esti - mates of regression coefﬁcients and R 2 values are reported in Table 3 ( for lab - based self - regulation measures ) and Table 4 ( for adult - reported self - regulation measures ) . Across models , unique variance contributed by the language predictors ranged from values of R 2 = 0 . 03 ( for language variables predicting behav - ioral persistence ) to R 2 = 0 . 15 ( for language variables predicting teacher - reported effortful control . Controlling for child age , gender , and family SES , Chinese receptive vocabulary uniquely predicted higher behavioral per - sistence . Chinese literacy uniquely predicted a lower number of commission errors on the response inhibition task ( failures of inhibition to No - Go stimuli ) , whereas English literacy uniquely predicted a lower number of omission errors on this task ( failure to respond to Go stimuli within the allotted time ) .

For the regression predicting % accuracy on incongruent - switch trials of the cognitive ﬂexibility task , there was a signiﬁcant interaction effect of Chinese literacy × English literacy . Following the procedures outlined by Aiken and West ( 1991 ) , simple slope analyses were conducted to probe the signiﬁcant interaction effect ( i . e . , Chinese literacy × English literacy predicting cognitive ﬂex - ibility ) . In simple slope analysis , the relations between Chinese literacy and cognitive ﬂexibility ( % accuracy on the incongruent - switch trials of the cognitive ﬂexibility task ) were estimated at three levels of English literacy : mean level , one standard deviation above the mean ( “high” ) , and one standard deviation below the mean ( “low” ) , controlling for other predictors in the model . At low and mean levels of English literacy , Chinese literacy was non - signiﬁcantly associated with the cognitive ﬂexibility score ( i . e . , unstandardized simple slopes were non - signiﬁcant ) ; at high lev - els of English literacy , Chinese literacy was positively related to cognitive ﬂexibility , the unstandardized simple slope ( SE ) = 0 . 35 ( 6 . 0 ) , p = 0 . 02 ( Figure 1 ) . Thus , cognitive ﬂexibility scores were positively associated with children’s bilingual literacy , but only for children with higher levels of proﬁciency in both English and Chinese . DISCUSSION The present study examined potential variations on the bilingual advantage in executive function in an ethnically homogeneous sample of bilingual children , and in doing so extended previ - ous research in three critical ways . First , our study provides only limited evidence that the bilingual advantage in executive func - tion may be observed on a continuum among children with varying levels of exposure and proﬁciency in two languages . Second , by utilizing a multi - method , multi - informant assessment www . frontiersin . org September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 1069 | 7 Chen et al . Immigrant children’s bilingualism and self - regulation FIGURE 1 | The interaction of Chinese × English literacy predicting cognitive ﬂexibility . The numbers in parentheses are unstandardized simple slopes . ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0 . 001 ; ∗∗ p ≤ 0 . 01 ; ∗ p ≤ 0 . 05 . of self - regulation as a broad construct , our study suggests that the bilingual advantage in executive function may be limited primar - ily to lab - based cognitive tasks of executive function , while higher proﬁciency in Chinese or English may be uniquely associated with children’s self - regulatory skills in home and school contexts . Third , by recruiting a diverse socioeconomic sample of Chinese American immigrant families , we were also able to identify the unique contributions of both socioeconomic and linguistic fac - tors to children’s self - regulation . Within our sample , family SES was positively associated with children’s English literacy as well as parent - rated effortful control . However , even when family SES was included as a covariate , our analyses still indicated signiﬁ - cant contributions of child language proﬁciencies across different domains of self - regulation . KEY FINDINGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Results from the present study both expand and reﬁne previ - ous ﬁndings on bilingualism and executive function . Namely , our results provide limited evidence that bilingualism - related advan - tages in executive function may be observed on a continuum among dual language learners , but only on laboratory - based tests of cognitive ﬂexibility , and only among children with highest levels of bilingual proﬁciency . Consistent with previous ﬁnd - ings ( Martin - Rhee and Bialystok , 2008 ) , children high in both English and Chinese proﬁciencies did not perform better on the Go / No - Go task , which involved inhibition of a response to a single - feature , or univalent display . Unexpectedly , higher bilingual proﬁciency was not signif - icantly associated with advantages in other domains of self - regulation . Rather , children’s higher proﬁciency in either Chinese or English was associated with better effortful control , better per - formance on a task of behavioral persistence , and fewer errors on the Go / No - Go task . As such , our ﬁndings suggest that previous cross - cultural differences in executive function observed between Asian and European American children ( Sabbagh et al . , 2006 ; Oh and Lewis , 2008 ; Lan et al . , 2011 ) may also be observed as variations within Asian American immigrant children . Our ﬁndings also highlight directions for future investigations that examine constructs not speciﬁed in our original hypotheses . For example , further consideration of children’s reaction time on the Go vs . No - Go trials may also yield more nuanced interpreta - tions of our ﬁndings . Post - hoc analyses indicated that children’s faster overall reaction time on the Go / No - Go task was associ - ated with higher English proﬁciency ( r = − 0 . 14 , p = 0 . 032 ) and more commission errors ( r = − 0 . 37 , p = 0 . 000 ) . In contrast , slower overall reaction times were associated with more omission errors ( r = 0 . 43 , p = 0 . 000 ) . Taken together , these preliminary results suggest that higher acculturation among immigrant chil - dren ( as reﬂected by higher English proﬁciency ) may also be associated with faster , and possibly more erroneous response tendencies . These results should be considered in light of the small effect sizes observed across models . Previous meta - analyses on the cog - nitive beneﬁts of bilingualism indicate a range of small to large effect sizes across studies , and suggest that these effect sizes may be larger in studies using quasi - experimental designs ( i . e . , com - parisons of bilinguals and monolinguals ) ( Adesope et al . , 2010 ) . Indeed , results of the present study are comparable to effect sizes found in other non - experimental studies examining predictors of children’s self - regulatory processes ( e . g . , Lengua et al . , 2007 ; Bernier et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , as language proﬁciency may be only one of a number of family - level processes that may con - tribute to self - regulatory capacities in immigrant children ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) , ﬁndings from the present study need to be replicated among other bilingual immigrant samples , and across different developmental periods . Future research can also help to identify the unique contri - butions of bilingualism and general verbal ability to different components of children’s self - regulation . For example , it is pos - sible that general verbal ability , rather than bilingualism , may facilitate children’s use of certain self - regulatory strategies and behaviors , such as support seeking or self - distraction ( Roben et al . , 2013 ) . Alternatively , as measures of verbal ability have been positively associated with some measures of executive function Frontiers in Psychology | Language Sciences September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 1069 | 8 Chen et al . Immigrant children’s bilingualism and self - regulation ( Hughes , 1998 ; Ardila et al . , 2000 ) , it is also possible that bilin - gual advantages on these tasks may be mediated by verbal ability . More speciﬁcally , future research is also needed to identify how aspects of language proﬁciency—i . e . , receptive vocabulary , liter - acy , and productive vocabulary—contribute uniquely to compo - nents of self - regulation . Indeed , a limitation of the present study is that measures of Chinese and English proﬁciency were not directly equivalent ( e . g . , receptive vocabulary was assessed only in Chinese ) . The cross - sectional design of the present study also limits interpretation of the directionality of relations between lan - guage and self - regulation . For example , children’s higher ﬂuency in Chinese language may reﬂect greater adherence to tradi - tional Chinese values of behavioral control and self - restraint . These values , in turn , may be reﬂected in the associations between Chinese proﬁciency and lower commission errors on the Go / No - Go Task . Moreover , while the aim of this study was to examine potential effects of children’s language proﬁ - ciencies on self - regulation , there is also evidence supporting reciprocal relations—i . e . , that children’s self - regulatory mecha - nisms may foster the development of language ( Blair and Razza , 2007 ; see Eisenberg et al . , 2005 , for a review ) . This inﬂuence may be particularly relevant for children of immigrant parents , and may also explain the positive associations between chil - dren’s English proﬁciency , lower omission errors and effortful control , which were not predicted by our hypotheses . The abil - ity to focus attention and persist in the face of distraction are likely to be key skills in children’s acquisition of a new language , whether learning language of a new host country , or maintain - ing their family’s heritage language . As such , future longitudinal research is needed to examine the reciprocal , prospective rela - tions between children’s dual language proﬁciencies and their self - regulation . In sum , ﬁndings from the present study underscore both the unique and interactive contributions of English and Chinese pro - ﬁciency to Chinese American children’s self - regulatory capacities . More broadly , our results build on previous research highlighting associations between bilingualism and Asian American immi - grant children’s positive developmental outcomes ( Han , 2010 ) , and suggest that children’s self - regulatory capacities may be a key mediator of these associations .
