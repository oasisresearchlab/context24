ABSTRACTObjective We aimed to investigate the relationship between tumour necrosis factor inhibitors ( TNFi ) therapy and the onset of new psoriasis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) using Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance ( CARRA ) Registry data . Methods De - identified data were obtained from the CARRA Registry . Patients with inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis documented on or prior to JIA diagnosis date or with incomplete data were excluded . Exposure to TNFi was categorised as : ( 1 ) ever use ; ( 2 ) current use or ( 3 ) first use only . Adjusted HRs ( aHRs ) were calculated between exposed and unexposed groups adjusted for methotrexate exposure , sex , race , family history of psoriasis and initial JIA category . Results A total of 8225 patients were included with a median follow - up of 3 . 9 years . Over half of the patients were prescribed TNFi ( n = 4437 , 54 % ) . The aHR of new onset of psoriasis after ever exposure to TNFi was 2 . 93 ( 2 . 15 to 3 . 98 ) . The incidence rate of psoriasis was the highest in children ever receiving and actively receiving adalimumab . Ever concurrent methotrexate use ( HR 0 . 45 , 0 . 29 to 0 . 69 ) was associated with lower risk . Conclusion In a large prospective JIA patient registry , we observed a nearly threefold increased risk of psoriasis after TNFi exposureCite Now INTRODUCTION Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors ( TNFi ) have been approved to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) in children . Children with underlying conditions including JIA , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) and chronic non - bacterial osteomyelitis ( CNO ) treated with TNFi may develop psoriasis after exposure to TNFi which is sometimes called paradoxical psori - asis , as TNFi also effectively treat psoriasis . 1 – 6 The most common paediatric presentations included plaque and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis with similar anatomical distribution to psoriatic lesions not associated with TNFi use . 7 In many cases of paradoxical psoriasis , topical treatments lead to sufficient control allowing for continuation of TNFi therapy , whereas TNFi may need to be discontinued in persistent cases . 7 8 In studies to date , paradox - ical psoriasis occurred at a median range of 4 – 20 months after exposure to TNFi . 2 3 5 6 9 10 Demo - graphic characteristics and concomitant therapy were not significantly associated with paradoxical psoriasis from a large paediatric cohort study . 1 A positive family history of psoriasis was noted in 5 % – 27 % of those who developed cutaneous lesions after exposure to TNFi . 2 3 5 6 9 10 A single - centre study that assessed rates of paradoxical psoriasis in JIA , IBD and CNO found that rates of psoriasis in TNFi exposed patients were higher for JIA and IBD , but not for CNO . Data from a large prospective clinic - based registry may help further elucidate the association between TNFi and subsequent psoriasis in JIA . We used data from Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance ( CARRA ) Registry to determine the risk from a geographically diverse population . PATIENTS AND METHODS Inclusion and exclusion criteria Data were obtained from the CARRA Registry for patients enrolled with a diagnosis of JIA from 30 June 2015 ( Registry inception date ) to 1 January 2020 with follow - up data . The CARRA Registry includes patients enrolled from 70 CARRA sites in North America . 11 Enrolment in the CARRA Registry Key messages What is already known about this subject ? ► Paradoxical psoriasis after exposure to tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) inhibitors ( TNFi ) is described in the paediatric population but the association between TNFi and subsequent psoriasis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) has not been systematically assessed using a large prospective clinic - based registry such as Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance . What does this study add ? ► In a large prospective JIA patient registry , we observed a nearly threefold increased risk of psoriasis after TNFi exposure compared with patients who were never treated with TNFi . ► The risk of new onset TNFi - associated psoriasis was increased in the non - psoriatic arthritis subset with the adjusted HRs ( 95 % CI ) of psoriasis of 5 . 60 ( 3 . 47 to 9 . 05 , p < 0 . 01 ) . ► Any concurrent methotrexate use was significantly associated with a lower hazard of psoriasis in patients without the psoriatic subtype of JIA ( HR = 0 . 45 ( 0 . 29 to 0 . 69 ) ) . How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments ? ► Increasing awareness of this unwanted side effect in JIA patients is important to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment . ► Concurrent methotrexate use could be considered to ameliorate the risk . 2 Zhao Y , et al . Ann Rheum Dis 2022 ; 0 : 1 – 4 . doi : 10 . 1136 / annrheumdis - 2021 - 221694 Paediatric rheumatology is not dependent on treatment with TNFi or any other specific medication use ( ie , it is not a drug - based registry ) . The sites are instructed to assess all patients in the CARRA Registry for events of special interest in the same way , irrespective of treatment . It is unlikely that surveillance for psoriasis was increased by treatment with TNFi among Registry patients . New onset skin psoriasis following patient enrolment is considered an ‘event of special interest’ that Registry sites are explicitly instructed to report . Furthermore , history of psoriasis is obtained at the time of Registry enrolment . International League of Association for Rheumatology ILAR classification is used by site to report the category at baseline and subsequent visits . Psoriatic arthritis is defined as arthritis with psoriasis or meeting at least two of the three criteria ( nail pitting , family history of psoriasis , dactylitis ) if without psoriasis . 12 Patients with IBD or psoriatic skin lesions documented on or prior to JIA diagnosis date were excluded , as were patients with incomplete data regarding TNFi start and stop dates and patients with no recorded follow - up time after JIA diagnosis ( figure 1 ) . New onset psoriasis was defined by first recorded instance of psoriasis following JIA diagnosis . Exposure to TNFi was assessed in multiple ways which were not mutu - ally exclusive as shown in figure 1 . We categorised exposure as : ( 1 ) Ever TNFi use : follow - up began with first TNFi use and continued until psoriasis outcome or most recent visit date , irre - spective of ongoing TNFi use or discontinuation . ( 2 ) Current TNFi use : follow - up began with first TNFi use and continued as long as TNFi use persisted . If TNFi was discontinued , then observation time attributed to TNFi was censored 60 days later . Follow - up was resumed for any subsequent restart of TNFi . Follow - up was censored at the first of : psoriasis outcome , most recent visit and most recent TNFi stop date . ( 3 ) First TNFi use : follow - up began with first TNFi use and continued as long as first TNFi use persisted . If first TNFi was discontinued , then observation time attributed to first TNFi was censored 60 days later . Follow - up was censored at the first of : psoriasis outcome , most recent visit and first TNFi stop date . The 60 - day extension of the exposure risk window was chosen because TNFi may have been discontinued presumptively at the onset of rash before the diagnosis of psoriasis is confirmed . Some TNFi exposure time occurred prior to Registry enrolment . We used the historical medication log ( retrospective data at enrolment ) and the diag - nosis date of comorbid condition at enrolment to make these assessments for some patients / exposures . Statistics Baseline characteristics were analysed with descriptive statistics . Incidence of psoriasis was calculated for each TNFi exposure method as number of cases per 1000 person - years , with 95 % CIs calculated using mid - p exact methods . Incidence on TNFi was assessed overall ( all TNFi ) and individually ( etanercept , adali - mumab and infliximab only ) . Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate HRs with 95 % Wald CIs comparing the hazard of developing psoriasis among patients ever exposed or first exposed to TNFi versus those never exposed , adjusted for any concurrent methotrexate exposure , sex , race , family history of psoriasis and initial JIA category . Patients with PsA were included in the primary analysis if they had not experienced skin psoriasis prior to TNFi use . Due to concerns about patients with PsA developing skin psoriasis as part of the expression of their disease rather than ‘paradoxical’ psoriasis , secondary analyses were conducted which stratified by PsA . For modelling , TNFi exposure was treated as a time - varying covariate in Cox regres - sion based on registry recorded start date of first TNFi , after which exposure was treated as a fixed exposure ( ever exposed ) . Exposure to methotrexate was assessed separately within TNFi unexposed and TNFi exposed time and was treated as fixed within the given exposure assessment period .

Ann Rheum Dis 2022 ; 0 : 1 – 4 . doi : 10 . 1136 / annrheumdis - 2021 - 221694 Paediatric rheumatology was considered statistically significant . Statistics were performed in SAS V . 9 . 4 . RESULTS A total of 8225 patients with JIA were included with a median follow - up of 3 . 9 years and analysed as depicted in figure 1 . The majority of patients were female and white ( table 1 ) . The mean age at the diagnosis of JIA was 7 . 5 years . Oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA were the most common categories . Over half of the patients were prescribed TNFi ( n = 4437 , 54 % ) at some point during observation . Etanercept was most commonly used as the first TNFi followed by adalimumab and infliximab . However , the overall usage was similar between etanercept and adalimumab . TNFi prescription patterns did not differ signifi - cantly among patients with PsA versus others ( online supple - mental table 1 ) . The incidence rate of psoriasis was much higher in PsA group ( 66 . 34 per 1000 person - years ) than in other groups combined ( 1 . 17 per 1000 person - years ) ( online supple - mental table 2 ) . The incidence rate of psoriasis was the highest in children who received adalimumab in ever exposure , current exposure and first exposure only calculations ( table 2 ) . The HR of new onset of psoriasis after ever exposure to TNFi was 3 . 02 ( CI 2 . 26 to 4 . 02 , unadjusted ) and 2 . 93 ( 2 . 15 to 3 . 98 , adjusted ) ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( table 3 ) . The adjusted HR ( 95 % CI ) of psoriasis after TNFi exposure was 1 . 68 ( 1 . 11 to 2 . 54 , p = 0 . 01 ) in psoriatic JIA . The risk of new onset TNFi - associated psoriasis was increased in the non - psoriatic arthritis subset . The adjusted HR ( 95 % CI ) of psoriasis after TNFi exposure was 5 . 60 ( 3 . 47 to 9 . 05 , p < 0 . 01 ) in non - psoriatic arthritis subset . Any concurrent methotrexate use was significantly associated with a lower hazard of psoriasis in patients without the psoriatic subtype of JIA ( HR = 0 . 45 ( 0 . 29 to 0 . 69 ) ) ; similar but non - significant associations were seen in patients with psoriatic JIA ( HR for methotrexate : 0 . 73 ( 0 . 49 to 1 . 08 ) ) . Family history of psoriasis and race / ethnicity were not associated with psoriasis development . DISCUSSION This is the largest study in a paediatric population ascertaining the increased risk of paradoxical psoriasis in children with JIA after exposure to TNFi . We found a threefold increase in the odds of psoriasis among patients with JIA treated with TNFi compared with those not treated with TNFi . We further investigated the risks of new onset of psoriasis in children with JIA during the first TNFi exposure , ever exposure and current exposure and did not find significant differences between exposure ascertainment methods . These results suggest that the risk is not altered by the duration of TNFi treatment and the incidence of psoriasis will continue to occur as patients remain on the treatment . In order to determine the continuing risk after discontinuation of TNFi , a longitudinal cohort of patients with prolonged observation time after complete discon - tinuation of TNFi is needed . Among the three most commonly prescribed TNFi , etanercept was most commonly used first , but adalimumab was used in a similar proportion of patients during the entire follow - up . The incidence rate of new onset psoriasis was significantly higher for adalimumab exposure than for etanercept exposure when total exposure time of each TNFi was considered . This result is consis - tent with published case series in which the majority of psoriasis occurred after exposure to adalimumab or infliximab . 3 4 Type 1 interferon is known to induce psoriasis and suppression of TNF has been associated with upregulated type 1 interferon . There - fore , we hypothesise that monoclonal antibody - based TNFi may be more associated with the development of psoriasis via potentiation of type 1 interferon due to more potent inhibition of TNF . 13 14 The HR of psoriasis was only 1 . 68 in children with a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis without pre - existing psoriasis , which was well below the HR of 5 . 6 in children with diagnosis of other categories of JIA . This finding suggests that while the overall risk of psoriasis was higher in children with psoriatic arthritis , the exposure to TNFi did not increase the risk in this subset of JIA as much . Both TNF and type 1 interferon may contribute to psori - asis while TNF regulates the production of type 1 interferon . Accordingly , it is possible that patients with psoriatic arthritis have relatively less production of type 1 interferon during the treatment of TNFi compared with other patients with JIA . Any concurrent methotrexate use was associated with a signifi - cantly lower hazard of psoriasis in patients with JIA without psoriatic arthritis , whereas family history of psoriasis and race / ethnicity were not associated with psoriasis development . These results implied that there was potential benefit of combining Table 2 Summary of psoriasis incidence Incidence rate Cases / 1000 person - years ( 95 % CI ) Median follow - up time ( months ) Raw totals Overall ( all follow - up time ) 5 . 33 ( 4 . 67 to 6 . 07 ) 46 . 9 223 cases / 41 831 PY Never exposed to TNFi 3 . 27 ( 2 . 62 to 4 . 03 ) 20 . 4 84 cases / 25 700 PY Ever exposed to TNFi 8 . 62 ( 7 . 27 to 10 . 14 ) 33 . 3 139 cases / 16 132 PY First exposure to TNFi 8 . 65 ( 6 . 67 to 11 . 03 ) 13 . 5 61 cases / 7056 PY Specific categories of TNFi exposure First use of any TNFi Etanercept 6 . 78 ( 4 . 69 to 9 . 50 ) 15 . 1 31 cases / 4573 PY Adalimumab 12 . 32 ( 8 . 22 to 17 . 8 ) 11 . 1 26 cases / 2110 PY Infliximab 9 . 04 ( 2 . 30 to 24 . 59 ) 12 . 2 3 cases / 332 PY First ever use of specific TNFi * * Etanercept 6 . 97 ( 4 . 88 to 9 . 68 ) 14 . 5 33 cases / 4731 PY Adalimumab 11 . 98 ( 8 . 60 to 16 . 27 ) 9 . 4 38 cases / 3173 PY Infliximab 6 . 44 ( 2 . 36 to 14 . 28 ) 10 . 4 5 cases / 776 PY Active use of specific TNFi Etanercept 5 . 46 ( 3 . 96 to 7 . 36 ) 22 . 5 40 cases / 7324 PY Adalimumab 13 . 41 ( 10 . 30 to 17 . 18 ) 12 . 2 59 cases / 4400 PY Infliximab 8 . 77 ( 4 . 88 to 14 . 61 ) 21 . 8 13 cases / 1483 PY * With or without other prior TNFi exposure .

Further investigation of this potential association is warranted . The study has some limitations . As a retrospective cohort study , patients were not randomised to receive TNFi treat - ment and therefore there is likely some degree of residual confounding in our assessment of the association between TNFi use and development of psoriasis . There may be risk factors for psoriasis development which we did not capture . Additionally , some data collected retrospectively may also have been subject to recall bias . However , appropriate controls , adjustment of covari - ates and rigorous censoring based on the event and follow - up strengthen the validity of our and others’ results . 1 CONCLUSION In a large prospective JIA patient registry , we observed a nearly threefold increased risk of psoriasis after TNFi exposure compared with patients who were never treated with TNFi . Increasing awareness of this unwanted side effect in paedi - atric community is important to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment .
