ABSTRACT Temperature - induced structural changes in the cortical region of the garland cell , which is considered to be active in endocytosis , were investigated in a temperature - sensitive , single gene mutant of Drosophila melanogaster , shibire tsl ( shi ) and wild - type ( Oregon - R ) . At 19°C , both shi and wild type showed similar structural features : an irregularly extended network of labyrinthine channels , coated pits and vesicles , tubular elements and alpha vacuoles . Tannic acid ( TA ) impregnation showed that coated pits comprised ~ 20 - 25 % of the total coated profiles at 19°C in both shi and wild - type . When flies were incubated in a horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) solution for 5 min , organelles such as coated profiles , tubular elements , and alpha vacuoles were labeled . In wild - type at 30°C , minor changes were observed - - mainly a decrease in the distribution of the labyrinthine channels and an increase in HRP uptake . On the other hand , in shi at 30°C , the labyrinthine channels were much elongated and their network became far more complex , indicating the expansion of the surface area of the cell . Also , the coated profiles were increased in number while the number of tubular elements was decreased considerably . The TA method showed that almost all of the coated profiles were coated pits , coated vesicles being almost completely absent at 30°C in shi . Furthermore , HRP uptake activity was considerably decreased at 30°C . These structural changes , as well as the reduced HRP uptake activity , were reversible when the temperature was lowered to 19°C . The observations suggest that in the garland cell of shi the conversion of coated pits to coated vesicles , that is , membrane pinch - off , is blocked at high temperature . The temperature - sensitive single gene mutant of Drosophila melanogaster , shibire ' sl ( shi ) , ~ behaves normally at 22 " C but shows a reversible paralysis at 29 " C ( 6 ) . Physiological studies have shown that a progressive diminution of its neuromus - cular excitatory junction potentials occurs as the temperature is raised above 28°C with moderate stimulation ( 0 . 5 Hz ) ( 11 , 23 ) . This effect appears to be presynaptic , since the muscle fibers respond normally to direct stimulation ( 11 ) , the sensi - tivity of the postsynaptic membrane to iontophoretically ap - plied 1 - glutamate ( putative transmitter , reference 9 ) remains unaltered ( Koenig , J .

The transmitter release mechanism ( exocytosis ) is apparently un - affected at high temperature , since normal - appearing minia - ture excitatory junction potentials and a normal - sized re - sponse to stimulation are observed if activity at the terminal is suppressed while the temperature is raised ( 14 , 20 ) . These observations suggest that a step in the recycling of synaptic vesicles might be blocked in this mutant , resulting in vesicle depletion as exocytosis proceeds at high temperature . This possibility is further suggested by the observation that many pitlike structures accumulate on the presynaptic membrane of various types of synaptic terminals of shi at high tempera - ture ( 16 ) . These observations suggest that the process of endocytosis THE IOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY • VOLUME 97 AUGUST 1983 499 - 507 © The Rockefeller University Press • 0021 - 9525 / 83 / 08 / 0499 / 09 $ 1 . 00 499 on J u l y 13 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m FIGURE 1 Electron micrograph of a garland cell of shi at 19°C .

There - fore , the garland cells ( or wreath cells ) , which are considered to be very active in endocytosis via coated vesicles ( 25 ) , were observed . These cells are very similar to pericardial cells ( 21 ) in structure and function and are classed together With the latter as " nephrocytes " , since they appear to function in the segregation and storage of waste products ( 25 ) . We report here temperature - induced structural changes in these garland cells in adult shi flies . These changes suggest that the endo - cytotic activity of the garland cell is blocked at high temper - ature at the step that converts coated pits to coated vesicles . MATERIALS AND METHODS The experimental animals were the wild - type strain , Oregon - R , and the single gene mutant , ( shi ) , of Drosophila melanogaster . 4 - 10 - d old adult female flies that had been raised at 17°C were used . For dissection , a fly was mounted laterally ( right side up ) with Tackiwax over an opening in a plastic tube in a dish , so that its left side remained exposed to air . Then it was covered with modified Bodensteln saline solution ( 10 ) , and FIGURES 2 - 7 Fig . 2 : Wild - type at 19°C .

The temperature was controlled by a thermoelectric unit placed under the dissecting dish and monitored by a thermistor in the saline solution . Four flies , two wild - type and two shi , were processed together to insure that these four flies were exposed to exactly the same conditions . Light and Electron Microscopy : For low temperature control experiments , the flies were dissected in saline at 19 * C , kept at that temperature for 5 - 20 min , and fixed at the same temperature with a mixture of 2 % paraformaldehyde and 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate or cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 - 7 . 4 ) . For high temperature experiments , the flies were dissected at 19 * C , kept at that temperature for 5 rain , and then the temperature was raised to 30 " C at a rate of about 1 - 2 * C / min . After 10 - min exposure to 30 " C , the flies were fixed at 30 " C with the same aldehyde mixture . For recovery experiments , flies were exposed to 30 " C for l0 min in the same way as that described above , then the temperature was lowered to 19 * C at a rate of ~ 1 - 2 * C / min and kept at that temperature for l0 min ( 10 - min recovery ) or 30 min ( 30 - min recovery ) before fixation . Specimens were postfixed in 2 % osmium tetroxide ( OsO4 ) in 0 . 1 M caco - dylate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) , block - stained in 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate , dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol , and embedded in Epon 812 . Semithin ( 0 . 5 ~ m ) sections were cut with glass knives and stained with 1 % toluidine blue . Two to four series of partially serial semithin sections of the anterior portions of ventral halves of the thorax were made from each of four different categories , i . e . , wild - type at 19 " and 30 " C , and shi at 19 " and 30 " C . Thin sections with white interference color were cut with Dupont diamond knives in a LKB ultramicro - tome , double - stained with uranyl acetate and Millonig ' s lead hydroxide ( 18 ) , and examined with a Philips 301 electron microscope . Tannic Acid Impregnation ( TA ) Method : Following the method of Bungaard , Frokjar - Jensen , and Crone ( 3 ) , tannic acid ( powder : Matheson Coleman and Bell Manufacturing Chemists , Norwood , OH ) was used to distinguish the organelles continuous to the extracellular spaces from intracel - lular organelles . After osmification , specimens were rinsed twice briefly with 1 % tannic acid in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) and immersed in the same tannic acid solution for 1 h at room temperature . Then they were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Epon 812 . Thin sections were double - stained as described above . The impregnation was very capricious . In a single specimen , some cells were well impregnated while others were not . Furthermore , even a single cell could have both well and poorly impregnated portions . For analysis , only well impregnated portions were selected . Horseradish Peroxidase ( HRP ) Uptake Experiments : To test the endocytotic activity of the garland cells , a 0 . 7 % solution of horseradish peroxidase ( type VI , Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) in modified Boden - stein saline solution was used . For low temperature experiments , flies were incubated at 19 * C with the HRP solution for 5 min after dissection , and then fixed at this temperature . For high temperature experiments , flies were dissected in saline solution and the temperature was raised as described previously . After 4 - min of exposure to 30 " C , the saline solution was replaced with the HRP solution . After a 5 - rain incubation with HRP at 30 " C , the flies were fixed with the aldehyde mixture at 30 " C and kept at that temperature for 10 - 15 rain , then returned to room temperature . For recovery experiments , the flies were incubated with the HRP solution in the same manner as that described for the high temperature experiments , then the temperature was lowered and kept at 19 " C for 10 min or 30 rain . The flies were fixed at 19 " C with the same aldehyde mixture . After l - h fixation in the aldehyde mixture , all flies were further dissected , with removal of the dorso - ventral muscles , the tergotrochanter muscle , and the upper five dorsal longitudinal muscles on both sides . The total duration of the aldehyde fixation was 2 - 3 h . Specimens were rinsed overnight in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) while being kept in the refrigerator . They were preincubated at room temperature for 30 min in a 0 . 05 % solution of 3 , 3 ' - diaminobenzidine - tetrahydrochloride ( DAB ; grade II , Sigma Chemical Co . ) in the same phosphate buffer and were subsequently incubated for 30 min in a 0 . 5 % DAB solution in the same phosphate buffer containing 0 . 01 % H202 ( 5 , 22 ) . The specimens were rinsed in the same phosphate buffer and postfixed in 2 % OsO4 in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) . After block - staining in uranyl acetate and dehydration in ethanol , the specimens were embedded in Epon 812 . Thin sections were usually observed without staining . For controls , either the incubation with HRP solution or the incubations in DAB and DAB + H202 solutions were omitted . In these controls , small dense granular structures , ~ 40 - 50 nm in diameter , were observed that were easily distinguishable from HRP - labeled structures . Measurements : Experimental changes in the numbers of coated pro - files and tubular elements were estimated by counting numbers of profiles per 1 / ~ m perimeter of the cell surface . For this purpose , electron micrographs were taken at a primary magnification of 10 , 000 or 13 , 000 ( calibrated by a Pelco ' s carbon grating replica ) and printed with a 2 . 5 magnification . Portions of garland cells cut perpendicular to the cell surface were selected . Profiles showing no clearly defined limiting membranes were not counted . The length of the surface perimeter was measured with a thread along the layer of the basement mem - brane . 5 - 22 photographs of cortical regions with 45 - 165 ~ m of total surface perimeter were analyzed from each fly . The numbers of coated vesicles and pits were counted by using electron micrographs of TA materials , and the percentage of coated vesicles in the total number of coated profiles was calculated . ~ 200 - 600 coated profiles were analyzed from each fly . For the measurements of the outer diameter of coated vesicles and pits , one TA material was selected for each condition . ~ 15 - 20 electron micrographs were taken from each fly at a primary magnification of 16 , 700 and enlarged 2 . 5 times . The final magnification of the prints was 41 , 700 ( calibrated by a Pelco ' s carbon grating replica ) . The outside diameters of the coated vesicles and pits were measured on the prints using calipers . The diameter of the coated vesicles of elongated or irregular shape was determined by ~ where a and b were distances along the shortest and longest axes , respectively . RESULTS The structural features of garland cells and pericardial cells have been well investigated both light and electron micro - scopically and are considered to be very similar in various insects ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 13 , 17 , 21 , 24 ) . Our observations were consistent with these previous descriptions . In adult Drosophila , the garland cells usually cluster near the junction between the ventriculus and the esophagus . There are ~ 10 garland cells on each side , which are ovoid in shape ( ~ 28 - 35 um by 10 - 17 um ) and have two subcentral spherical nuclei ~ 4 # m in diameter ( Fig . 1 ) . No consistent differences in the distribution , size , or shape of the garland cells between wild - type and shi at either low or high temperatures were observed . The cytoplasm of the garland cell consists of two concentric regions , the central region and the cortical region ( Fig . 1 ) , as FIGURES 8 - 12 Fig . 8 : Wild - type at 19°C , tannic acid impregnation .

Here , we will focus on the structure of the cortical region , where a major part of the endocytotic process takes place . Effect of Temperature WILD - TYPE AND SHI AT 19°C : At I9°C , no obvious difference in the fine structure of the cortical region of the garland cells was observed between shi and wild - type flies . A layer of basement membrane , ~ 25 - 30 nm thick , covered the whole surface of each garland cell but never penetrated into the labyrinthine channels ( Figs . 1 - 3 ) . The cytoplasm sur - rounding the channel openings contained a dense material , while a thin bridge of extracellular material spanned the openings . Within some parts of the channels , an extracellular material that sometimes showed periodicity was observed ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . Almost all of the labyrinthine channels were located near the surface of a cell and did not penetrate into the central region ( Figs . 1 - 3 ) . Many coated profiles were seen in the cortical region . They have been classified into two groups ( 2 , 4 ) , one ~ 60 - 90 nm in diameter , the other ~ 120 - 180 nm in diameter . The smaller coated profiles were usually found near or at the surface opposing the basement membrane and did not contain any material in them ( see inset b in Fig . 5 ) . The larger ones were usually seen to arise from or lie between labyrinthine channels and contained material similar to that in the channels ( Figs . 2 and 3 ; also , for higher magnification see inset a in Fig . 5 ) . The latter were far more prevalent , representing ~ 95 % of the total coated profiles in shi and wild - type at 19°C . Other organelles observed in the cortical region were tu - bular elements , small dense granules , alpha vacuoles , free ribosomes , and small cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticu - lum . The tubular elements were membrane - bound and cylin - drical , ~ 60 - 75 nm in diameter . A layer of dense material that appeared to be made of subunits ( 2 , 4 , 2 l ) was seen to occupy the inside of the tubular elements . Some of the tubular elements had swollen bulbs on one end ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) , which also contained dense materials . Tubular elements that ap - peared to be connecting to alpha vacuoles were often ob - served . As reported previously ( 2 , 4 , 21 ) , no tubular elements showed a connection with the plasma membrane . Alpha vacuoles ( 4 ) , which were usually located slightly away from the cell surface , were very prominent structures in the cortical region ( Figs . 1 - 3 ) . They were round or ovoid in shape and varied considerably in size , from ~ 0 . 2 to 3 gm in diameter . The inside of the vacuoles was lined with a dense material and usually contained one or more aggregates of a dense granular material that appeared to adhere to the limiting membrane . Small dense granules of various shapes containing dense materials similar to those in the beta vacuoles were also observed ( 4 ) . The beta vacuoles were mainly localized in the central region ( Fig . 1 ) . W I L D - T V P E A T 3 0 ° C : The structural features Of the cor - tical region in wild - type flies at 30°C were fairly similar to those of the low temperature controls , but there seemed to be minor quantitative changes ( Fig . 4 ) . The labyrinthine chan - nels appeared decreased in length and were usually confined to the peripheral 0 . 5 ~ m of cytoplasm , although some chan - nels extended close to the nucleus . The number of coated profiles stayed almost the same , but the size appeared to be smaller . Alpha vacuoles appeared to decrease in size and 504 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 97 , 1983 become irregular in shape , and the number of tubular ele - ments and small , dense granules appeared to be increased . SHI AT 30°C : In contrast to the minor changes seen in wild - type , shi showed consistent , major structural changes at 30°C ( Fig . 5 ) . One prominent change was an elongation of the labyrinthine channels . In striking contrast to wild - type , the majority of the labyrinthine channels of shi extended radially 2 - 3 # m or more from the surface . They ran relatively parallel to one another and appeared to make a wide channel layer of regular width at the periphery . Thus , the surface area of the labyrinthine channels was increased considerably . A second prominent change was an increase in the number of coated profiles , particularly coated pits . Small coated profiles were encountered very frequently near or at the surface of the cell , while large coated profiles were frequently observed to arise from the elongated channels . Many of these coated profiles could be recognized as coated pits arising from the cell surface or the labyrinthine channels . A third prominent change was a considerable decrease in the number of tubular elements and alpha vacuoles . In addition to the three major changes described above , the small dense granules appeared to increase in number and were frequently observed between elongated labyrinthine channels . RECOVERY : The temperature - induced structural changes in the cortical region of the garland cell in shi were reversible when the temperature was lowered to 19°C . After a 30 - min recovery , the structural features of the cortical region were very similar to those at 19°C ( Figs . 6 and 7 ) . The distribution of labyrinthine channels and the number of coated profiles and tubular elements appeared to return to their control levels . The minor structural changes observed in wild - type also appeared to be reversible . TA Impregnation TA - impregnated materials were used to distinguish between those structures that were continuous with the extracellular space ( e . g . , labyrinthine channels and coated pits ) and those that were not ( e . g . , coated vesicles , tubular elements ) . WILD - TYPE AND SHI AT 19°C : The distribution of the labyrinthine channels , which appear as darkly impregnated structures , is well demonstrated by this technique . Further - more , coated profiles can now be clearly distinguished as impregnated coated pits or unimpregnated coated vesicles ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) . Thus , it could be observed that there were no significant differences between wild - type and shi at 19°C in the number of coated profiles per 1 ~ m surface perimeter or in the percentage of coated vesicles in the total number of coated profiles ( 20 - 25 % ) ( Table I ) . Tubular elements were not impregnated with TA . Therefore , they do not connect with the extracellular space . WILD - TYPE AT 30°C : The labyrinthine channels were confined to the cortical region near the surface as shown in Fig . 10 . Both coated pits ( impregnated ) and coated vesicles ( unimpregnated ) are seen in this figure . The number of coated profiles per gm of surface perimeter decreased and the per - centage of the coated vesicles in total coated profiles increased compared with those at 19°C ( Table I ) . SHI AT 30°C : The labyrinthine channels in shi at 30°C showed a striking change from those at 19°C . This is clearly demonstrated in Fig . 11 . The channels were extended radially toward the center of the cell , forming a 2 - 3 - ~ m - wide impreg - nated layer along the cell surface . This temperature - induced on J u l y 13 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m elongation is apparent when this is compared with either shi at 19°C ( Fig . 9 ) or wild - type at 30°C ( Fig . 10 ) . Another prominent characteristic revealed by TA impregnation was that almost all of the coated profiles were impregnated ( Fig . 11 ) . Thus , they represent coated pits , not coated vesicles . On the other hand , coated vesicles ( unimpregnated ) were very rare ( Fig . 11 and Table I ) . Thus the percentage of coated vesicles in the total coated profiles was drastically reduced ( Table I ) . Large coated pits were seen to arise from the elongated labyrinthine channels . Since the total number of coated profiles was considerably increased in addition to the decrease in the percentage of coated vesicles in the total coated profiles , a large increase in the number of coated pits occurred in shi at 30°C . Besides the increase in the number of large coated pits , small coated pits , which were rare in shi at low temperature or in wild - type , were observed frequently near or at the surface of the cell ( Fig . 11 ) . ~ 10 % of the total coated profiles were small coated pits . It was also observed that the number of tubular elements decreased considerably ( Fig . 11 and Table I ) . RECOVERY : After exposure to high temperature ( 30°C ) for l0 min , the temperature was lowered to the control level ( 19°C ) . The reversibility of the temperature effect was ob - served after 30 min at 19°C . The distribution of the labyrin - thine channels and the number of coated profiles and tubular elements returned to the original level ( Fig . 12 ) . Also , the percentage of coated vesicles in the total coated profiles re - turned to the original level ( Table I ) . Thus , the temperature effect was reversible . The temperature effect on the number of coated profiles and tubular elements and on the percentage of coated vesicles in total coated profiles is summarized in Table I . This table depicts clearly the structural changes in the shi garland cells , i . e . , the increase in the number of coated pits and the drastic decrease of the number of coated vesicles and tubular ele - ments . Table II shows the sizes of the coated vesicles and pits in various conditions . The sizes of the coated pits and vesicles seemed to be the same in shi and wild - type at 19°C . At 30°C , a decrease in the size of the coated pits was apparent in shi . HRP Experiments The three drastic structural changes in shi at 30°C that were described in the previous section suggest that endocytotic activity is affected at high temperature in this mutant . This was confirmed by experiments on HRP uptake . At 19°C , no differences were observed between wild - type and shi in HRP uptake . After a 5 - min incubation with HRP , coated profiles , tubular elements , and alpha vacuoles were labeled ( Figs . 13 and 14 ) . When flies were incubated with HRP for 5 min at 30°C , wild - type showed an HRP uptake similar to or greater than that at 19°C . The structures labeled with HRP were the same as those labeled at 19°C , i . e . , coated profiles , tubular elements , and alpha vacuoles ( Fig . 15 ) . On the other hand , in shi at 30°C , only alpha vacuoles of reduced size with dense granular aggregates were labeled ( Fig . 16 ) . Since the number and the size of alpha vacuoles were decreased as described before , the overall uptake of HRP was considerably decreased at this temperature . The suppression of HRP uptake in shi at 30°C was revers - ible . After exposure to 30°C for 5 min , the temperature was lowered to 19°C and the fly was allowed to recover for 10 min . After that , HRP was applied for 5 min . Coated profiles , tubular elements , and alpha vacuoles were labeled in the same way as those of the low temperature controls . DISCUSSION The results present four major observations on the effect of high temperature on the garland cells of the mutant , shi : ( a ) The surface area of the plasma membrane increased drasti - cally through the elongation and increase in complexity of the labyrinthine channels . ( b ) The number of coated pits increased while the number of coated vesicles decreased . ( c ) The number of tubular elements and alpha vacuoles de - creased . ( d ) The uptake of HRP was greatly reduced . What do these observations suggest about the nature of the shi defect ? The increase in the labyrinthine channels , which represents a large increase in the surface area of the plasma membrane , suggests that an imbalance in the rates of exo - and endocytosis has occurred . This increase could be due either to a relative increase in the rate of exocytosis , which would add intracellular membrane to the plasma membrane , TABLE II Outside Diameters of Coated Pits and Vesicles Genotype Temperature Coated pit Coated vesicle nm nm Wild - type 19°C 150 ± 23 ( 130 ) 160 ± 27 ( 40 ) Wild - type 30°C 134 ± 22 ( 172 ) 137 ± 22 ( 115 ) shi 19°C 146 ± 23 ( 134 ) 158 ± 22 ( 45 ) shi 30°C 117 ± 20 ( 168 ) shi 19°C ( 30 min 133 + 20 ( 146 ) 128 ± 19 ( 48 ) recovery ) Values are expressed as mean - + standard error nm .

VOLUME 97 , 1983 or to a relative decrease in the rate of endocytosis , which would cause a build - up of plasma membrane as exocytosis proceeded uninhibited . The considerable decrease in HRP uptake at high temperature suggests that the second possibil - ity , i . e . , a decrease in endocytosis , may be responsible . If , indeed , the endocytotic process is blocked ( or slowed down ) , then at what step in this process does the block occur ? TA impregnation showed that at 30 " C the number of coated pits increased while the number of coated vesicles and tubular elements drastically decreased . These observations suggest that the conversion of coated pits to coated vesicles , i . e . the membrane pinch - off mechanism , is blocked in shi at high temperature . The mechanism responsible for this block in pinch - off appears to be common to various types of cells . For example , in neurons it has been observed that very similar morpholog - ical changes occur at the terminal in shi at high temperature , i . e . , an increase in the surface area of the plasma membrane , an increase in pitlike structures , and a decrease in synaptic vesicles ( 16 ) . The temperature - dependent depletion of syn - aptic vesicles was suggested to be the result of a block in endocytosis at the step of membrane pinch - off ( 15 , 16 ) . Although most investigators seem to agree that coated vesicles in pericardial and garland cells take up protein from the hemolymph , the intracellular pathway of these absorbed proteins is not clear . Sanger and McCann ( 21 ) showed that organelles such as coated vesicles , alpha vacuoles , and tubular elements of the pericardial cell were labeled by ferritin . On the basis of these results , they presented a scheme of the pathway of protein uptake , in which they postulated the transformation of coated vesicles to tubular elements via smooth tubular vesicles ( Fig . 9 in Sanger and McCann [ 21 ] ) . On the other hand , Crossley ( 4 ) reported that tracer molecules did not enter the tubular elements , suggesting that tubules are not involved in the endocytotic pathway . The present results , however , suggest that the tubular elements are , indeed , in - volved in the endocytotic pathway . Our HRP experiments showed labeling of tubular elements as well as coated profiles . Secondly , a decrease in the number of these elements oc - curred , along with a decrease in coated vesicles , when the temperature was raised to 30°C . These observations are con - sistent with Sanger and McCann ' s ( 21 ) suggestion that coated vesicles are transformed into tubular elements , although the pathway through smooth tubular vesicles remains to be de - termined . In addition , our observations suggest that the tu - bular elements may give rise to alpha vacuoles . Thus , it was often observed that tubular elements are connected to a bulb that contains electron - dense material reminiscent of a small alpha vacuole . Furthermore , these organelles were labeled with HRP . Therefore , it may be that , in the garland cell , the endocytotic pathway occurs in the following order ; coated pit - - coated vesicle - - tubular element - - bulb - - alpha vacuole . Of course , much experimentation must still be performed before a determination of the pathway can be made . The fact that the endocytotic process can be reversibly controlled by temperature in this mutant should prove an invaluable tool bation at 30°C . Coated profiles , tubular elements and alpha vacu - oles are labeled . The number of labeled structures appears to be increased compared with that at 19°C . Bar , 1 ~ m . x 26 , 200 . Fig . 16 .

Such a study using this mutant is presently underway in our laboratory . The above results , as well as those on synaptic terminals ( 15 , 16 ) , are compatible with the possibility that the mem - brane pinch - off mechanism is blocked in shi at high temper - ature . This possibility must be further investigated in these tissues and in other tissues as well and is being pursued in our laboratory at the present time . Hopefully , this mutant will offer some important new clues as to how membrane pinch - off occurs . We wish to express our thanks to Dr . J . H .
