Local markets feature locally produced and consumed offerings and consistent patterns of competitive density . Traded markets feature non - local economic exchanges that create revenue flows from one geographic market to another and divergent levels of competitive density . High levels of competitive density create intense rivalry in the local market , which fosters product innovation and success in traded markets . By explicitly accounting for these countervailing effects , conceptually and empirically , this study offers fresh insights into equivocal findings regarding the effects of competitive concentration . The results offer compelling evidence that competitive density in the performing arts has a positive effect on product innovation , an increasingly positive effect on traded market performance , and negative effects on local market performance attributable to competitive rivalry . Keywords : Competitive density , product innovation , performing arts , nonprofit marketing Introduction Competition plays a key role in determining organizational actions and outcomes ( Jansen , Van den Bosch , and Volberda 2006 ) , but the nature of the relationship is obscured by offsetting effects that arise when competitors locate near one another ( e . g . , Shaver and Flyer 2000 ) . Positive effects from competitive density emerge when a dense concentration of competitors creates knowledge spillovers ( Butt et al . 2018 ; Song , Almeida , and Wu 2003 ; Swaminathan 2001 ; Venturini , Ceccagnoli , and van Zeebroeck 2018 ) , or when shopping destinations attract customers seeking greater selection ( Arentze , Oppewal , and Timmermans 2005 ; Thill 1986 ) . Negative effects emerge when organizations compete for scarce talent and resources , when interfirm mobility leads to new competitors ( Klepper 2010 ; Wezel , Cattani , and Pennings 2006 ) , or when direct rivalry forces competitors to fight for the same customers ( Bloom , Schankerman , and Van Reenen 2013 ) . These countervailing forces have produced equivocal empirical findings for the effects of competitive concentration on organizational outcomes . According to Frenken , Cefis , and Stam ( 2015 , p . 10 ) “there is… little evidence that [ collocated ] clusters enhance firm growth and firm survival . ” McCann and Folta ( 2008 , p . 540 ) offer that , “any conclusions regarding the empirical record in the agglomeration literature should remain tentative at this point . ” Our study offers new insights with respect to competitive density in the nonprofit performing arts sector . 1 First , building on the idea of multimarket competition ( Jayachandran , Gimeno , and Varadarajan 1999 ) , we make a conceptual contribution by identifying important 1 Various terms describing competitive density appear in the literature , including agglomeration ( Gaubert 2018 ; Kalnins and Chung 2004 ; Liu , Steenkamp , and Zhang 2018 ; Shaver and Flyer 2000 ) , clustering ( Butt et al . 2018 ; Frenken , Cefis , and Stam 2015 ; Porter 2003 ) , locational differentiation ( Iyer and Seetharaman 2008 ) , and market structure or size ( Datta and Sudhir 2013 ; Davis and Dingel 2019 ; Goettler and Gordon 2014 ) . Following Ciccone and Hall ( 1996 ) , we focus on the geographic density of economic activity and use the term competitive density , which we define as the relative concentration of competing organizations within a geographic market . 2 differences between traded and local markets . We show that these differences can explain seemingly equivocal empirical results with respect to competitive density in the performing arts sector ( Reddy et al . , 1998 ) . Most economic activity features locally produced and consumed offerings ( Porter 2003 ) , activity that merely circulates revenue and produces consistent patterns of competitive density across geographic markets ( Jensen 2011 ) . The resulting balance between local supply and demand offers no theoretical explanation for positive returns to competitive density . Traded markets are critical to explaining positive returns to competitive density because exporting brings additional revenue into the area and supports a concentration of competitors and suppliers . The differences between local and traded markets are well - established in economics , but to our knowledge the marketing literature has not explicitly addressed these macrosegments . Our second contribution is in delineating the mediating role of product innovation , which we define as the ability to formulate and develop new products ( Moorman and Slotegraff 1999 ) . This focus on committing resources to new product development is consistent with current thinking that aligns innovation with implementation ( Anderson , Potočnik , and Zhou 2014 ) . While it is generally acknowledged that product innovation leads to improved market performance ( for an overview , see Rubera and Kirca , 2012 ) , linking competitive density to product innovation and market performance fills a gap in the literature identified by Crossan and Apaydin ( 2010 , pp . 1176 - 77 ) , who conclude that “…studies concerned with innovation outcomes treat them as a dependent variable and not as a mediator to performance . . . A possible way to advance this research is to test the connection between identified innovation determinants , innovation outcomes , and firm performance . ” In the next section , we expand on the theoretical rationale for why product innovation mediates the relationship between competitive density and market performance and how 3 characteristics of traded and local markets moderate the relationship with revenue performance . We then describe the empirical study and analyses , which isolate the positive and negative effects of competitive density and control for alternative explanations . We conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice . Linking Competitive Density to Product Innovation and Market Performance Local competition threatens survival , which motivates organizations to innovate ( Schumpeter 1942 ) . Extensive research in marketing has examined the role of competitive intensity but empirical results have been equivocal ( e . g . , Kirca , Jayachandran , and Bearden 2005 ) . Far less research has examined the role of competitive density . One relevant study ( Voss and Voss 2008 ) links competitive density to relative success in attracting transactional as opposed to relational customers . Research at the product manufacturer level ( Bowman and Gatignon 1995 ) suggests that competitive density influences competitor response time to new product introductions . At the customer level , competitive density can exert countervailing effects on customer repurchase ( Seiders et al . 2005 ) , which can vary depending on industry characteristics ( Voss , Godfrey , and Seiders 2010 ) . We extend this stream of research by proposing that competitive density has direct , differential effects on local and traded market performance as well as indirect effects , mediated by product innovation ( see Figure 1 ) . - - - - - Insert Figure 1 - - - - - Our study’s key contribution is in demonstrating how competitive effects diverge in local versus traded markets . Local market activity involves local production that is derived from local resources and consumed by local customers . Direct rivalry with local competitors manifests as competition for resources as well as customers . Traded markets feature non - local economic exchanges resulting in revenue flows from one geographic market to another . These trade flows , 4 both internationally and within - nation , are increasingly important in the digital , knowledge economy ( Gaubert 2018 ; Jensen 2011 ) . Sectors that were historically viewed as primarily serving local markets are expanding their offerings to traded markets . For example , state universities initially established to serve the local citizenry now offer online courses to anyone in the world ( Lederman and Lieberman , 2019 ) . We now develop specific hypotheses that explicate the central role played by competitive density in driving product innovation and performance outcomes in traded and local markets . We begin by examining how product innovation mediates the effect of competitive density on performance . We then proceed to the direct effects of competitive density on traded and local market revenues . The Mediating Role of Product Innovation Following Cohen and Levinthal ( 1990 ) , we conceptualize product innovation as a learning routine that assimilates and exploits knowledge from the environment . The process involves complex bundles of skills that transform tacit , complex , and dynamic sources of knowledge into valuable outputs and outcomes ( e . g . , Day 1994 ; Fabrizio and Thomas 2012 ) . Product innovation focuses on developing new , theoretically limitless , ideas , which implies non - exclusionary competition and considerable potential for mutualism , that is , symbiotic interaction where both parties benefit . Mutualism takes the form of knowledge spillovers in product innovation and leads to a positive effect for competitive density on product innovation ( e . g . , Cohen and Levinthal 1990 ) . Organizations accomplish this through competitive monitoring ( Gatignon and Xuereb 1997 ; Jaworski and Kohli 1993 ; Morgan , Vorhies , and Mason 2009 ; Slater and Narver 1994 ; Voss and Voss 2008 ) , learning by hiring ( Slavova , Fosfuri , and De Castro 2016 ; Song , Almeida , and Wu 5 2003 ) , and accumulation of human capital based on social interactions ( Berliant , Reed , and Wang 2006 ) . Tacit or contextual knowledge , which is best transmitted via face - to - face , frequent , and repeated exchanges ( von Hippel 1994 ) , enhances the importance of collocated competition , knowledge transfers , and product innovation . Empirical evidence largely supports a positive relationship between competitive density and product innovation ( Morris 2018 ) , especially when measured in terms of patents and patent citations ( Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009 ; Feldman 1999 ) . Feldman and Audretsch ( 1999 ) also find a positive relationship between competitive density and product innovation measured as the number of product introductions . Studies also support links between competitive density and product differentiation in retail contexts ( Datta and Sudhir 2013 ; Iyer and Seetharaman 2008 ) . Evidence also suggests that the relationship between competitive density and innovation may be curvilinear . For example , Carlino , Chatterjee , and Hunt ( 2007 ) report higher patents per capita as employment density increases , but they note that the rate of increase diminishes for the very largest cities . This diminishing effect is consistent with the analytic study by Goettler and Gordon ( 2014 ) , who argue for an inverted U - shaped relationship between competition and innovation . The relationship critically depends on innovation spillovers – a key assumption in the present work – and also on the extent to which entry barriers are present . Given both theoretical , analytical , and empirical support , we expect a diminishing positive relationship between competitive density and product innovation . H1 : Competitive density exerts diminishing positive direct effects on product innovation . Product innovation increases customer benefits , which implies positive effects on both traded and local market revenues . We expect that these positive effects are decreasing for two reasons ( Romer 1986 ) : ( 1 ) Production returns to accumulated knowledge are greater than returns 6 to new knowledge , and ( 2 ) Competitors can absorb some of the innovation returns due to the inability to perfectly patent or copyright an innovation . Diminishing returns to innovation are also consistent with the organizational ambidexterity literature , which argues that superior performance requires a balance between exploratory innovation and exploitative alignment . Positive effects for creativity , innovativeness , and innovation potential on organizational performance are widely supported ( Crossan and Apaydin 2010 ; Dahl and Moreau 2002 ; Rao et al . 2008 ; Rubera and Kirca 2012 ) . The effect is especially pronounced for radical innovations ( Sorescu , Chandy , and Prabhu 2003 ) . Empirical research also finds diminishing returns ( Ravichandran , Han , and Mithas 2017 ) , which leads us to hypothesize diminishing positive returns to product innovation in both traded and local markets . H2 : Product innovation has diminishing positive direct effects on an organization’s ( a ) traded market revenues and ( b ) local market revenues . Direct Effect of Competitive Density on Traded and Local Market Performance Hypotheses H1 and H2 establish that the effect of competitive density on market performance is mediated in part or in whole by product innovation . Following generally accepted practices for assessing mediation ( Kenny , Kashy , and Bolger 1998 ) , we explicitly examine whether competitive density has a direct effect on local and traded market performance that is not fully mediated by product innovation . There are two general reasons to expect direct effects for competitive density on market performance . First , a direct effect allows for omitted , mediating organizational capabilities that are not included in the present investigation ( e . g . , supply chain , operations ) . Second , competitive density can have direct effects on demand – for example , increased variety - seeking behaviors ( Voss and Voss 2008 ) – that are not mediated by organizational capabilities . 7 Increasing returns to competitive density for traded revenue . The idea that competitive density has increasing returns to traded but not local market revenues can be traced to Marshall ( 1920 ) and explains the competitive advantage of nations ( Porter 1990 ) and large cities ( e . g . , Krugman 1991 ) . Despite these broad applications , there is no literature that explicitly examines diverging effects for competitive density in traded versus local markets . Direct positive effects for competitive density on traded market demand can be explained by structural and reputational mechanisms . For example , channels of distribution that are developed at the market level facilitate exporting for all organizations in the market . These channels could include physical infrastructure ( e . g . , transportation hubs ) as well as distribution agents that facilitate order fulfillment . Demand preference for offerings from a certain origin also explain direct effects of competitive density on traded market demand . For example , wine lovers may develop a preference for wines grown in Napa Valley based on beliefs that Napa wines are superior to wines from other regions . Thus , local competitive density exerts direct positive effects on traded market demand when the concentration of competitors precipitates the creation of market - level structural advantages and when non - local demand develops a preference for goods and services from a specific market . Emerging research at both the individual and organizational level of theory and analysis provides additional insights for mechanisms that drive increasing returns in traded markets . Davis and Dingel’s ( 2019 ) spatial equilibrium theory explains increasing returns to high - ability individuals who move to high - density cities for enhanced opportunities for both learning and earning that derive from their ability to produce outputs that are valued in traded markets ; low - ability producers do not realize enhanced earning because their outputs are not valued in traded markets and they face local competition for outputs that have only local value . Gaubert ( 2018 ) 8 estimates the relative contribution of competitive collocation to productivity in traded market sales , concluding that competitive density accounts for approximately 50 % of increasing returns , with the remaining 50 % attributable to the organization . These results establish that competitive density has direct positive effects on traded market demand after controlling for organizational capabilities . Following theoretical and empirical research indicating that traded market returns are increasingly positive as competitive density increases , we hypothesize that : H3a : Competitive density exerts increasingly positive direct effects on an organization’s traded market revenue . Negative returns for local revenue . We expect competitive density will have a negative direct effect on local market revenue due to product market rivalry ( Bloom , Schankerman , and Van Reenen . 2013 ) . Faced with many options , customers engage in price - seeking behaviors that put downward pressure on local revenues ( Bowman and Gatignon 1998 ) . By definition , average local market revenue , which is total local market revenue divided by the total number of local competitors , is inversely related to the number of competitors . Increasing the number of competitors implies a smaller slice of the pie for each competitor . This expectation is consistent with empirical findings suggesting a negative effect for competition on organizational success rate ( Barnett and Carroll 1987 ) . In one prior study that examines the effect of competitive density on local market revenues ( Voss and Voss 2008 ) , the reported results indicate that the direct effect on local market revenues is negative , especially at higher levels of competitive density . This leads us to hypothesize : H3b : Competitive density exerts increasingly negative direct effects on an organization’s local market revenue . 9 Empirical Context , Construct Measurement , and Model Specification The idea that competitive density provides substantial benefits in traded markets , where the positive effects of competition on product innovation pay off , but is detrimental to local market performance , due to revenues being distributed among competitors , generalizes to any industry where competitors engage in both traded and local market activity . This requires a business model that generates distinct revenue streams such that arbitrage or substitution is not practical . The nonprofit performing arts in the United States features these characteristics and is ideal for examining links between competitive density , product innovation , and market performance for several reasons . First , as detailed in Beaudry and Schiffauerova ( 2009 ) , the detection of competitive externalities is more robust when evaluating fine - grained industry sectors , leading the authors to recommend a minimum three - digit industry classification . The performing arts ( North American Industry Classification System 7111x ) satisfies this criterion . Second , the performing arts offer clearly delineated revenue streams that follow the economics of traded and local markets . These distinct outcomes allow us to isolate the positive effects of competitive density on traded market revenue and the potentially negative effects of product market rivalry on local market revenue . Third , the nonprofit performing arts feature fast - cycle competition . Organizations in our sample introduced an average of 17 offerings per year , ranging from exploitation of classics , such as Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet , to exploration of new works of art , which confer intellectual property rights ( e . g . , the musical Hamilton in 2015 ) . The rapid product development cycle ensures a dynamic environment , where competitive offerings change frequently and local market performance , in the form of customer and critical response to those offerings , is registered in a matter of days or weeks . 10 Finally , product development at these nonprofit performing arts organizations features self - organizing , multifunctional teams that typically change with each production . To build these teams , organizations draw from overlapping networks of actors , musicians , designers , and directors , much like the movie networks described by Narayan and Kadiyali ( 2016 ) . Artistic employees are hired on a contract basis for a specific production , and successful artists work on different projects at three or more organizations in a given year . The average organization in our sample hired 51 employees per year on a contract basis . These characteristics provide an ideal context for examining supply - side externalities linking competitive density to product innovation and performance . We now describe the local geographic market and organization - level measures . The data set is specifically constructed to test the hypotheses and allows us to address additional empirical challenges associated with collocation research ( Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009 ; McCann and Folta 2008 ) . Table 1 provides an overview of construct measurement and data sources , and Table 2 shows summary statistics and correlations for the continuous variables . - - - - - Insert Table 1 and Table 2 about here - - - - - Local Geographic Market Variables We use longitudinal , distance - discounted local geographic market data to operationalize competitive density and control for environmental munificence , complementary and total business activity . In doing so , we address a key empirical challenge regarding the appropriate level of aggregation for geographic area variables . McCann and Folta ( 2008 ) critique prior research for using aggregated data with geolocations defined for areas as small as a one - mile radius and as large as entire states . They recommend using geolocation measures aggregated over the distance for which externalities are expected to extend and cite studies ( e . g . , Rosenthal 11 and Strange 2001 ; Henderson 2003 ) that indicate that externalities drop rapidly in the first few miles and more slowly beyond the first few miles . We followed these recommendations to construct a spatial model that controls for cross - sectional and longitudinal variations in local geographic market characteristics . We operationalized the spatial model at the zip code level and integrated zip code and census - tract level data . To spatialize zip code level data , we calculated geographic distances between all zip codes , using population - weighted centroid longitudes and latitudes . To spatialize census - tract level data , we calculated geographic distances between every zip code and every census tract , again using population - weighted centroid longitudes and latitudes . We then applied an empirically validated , exponential power decay function ( α = . 91 ; β = . 46 ) to weight every metric within 50 kilometers of each zip code , which is consistent with other research operationalizing local retail markets ( e . g . , Ozturk , Venkatraman , and Chintagunta 2016 ) . 2 The decay function assigns weights of 100 % at zero distance ( i . e . , the same zip code ) , 40 % at one kilometer , 7 % at 10 kilometers , etc . The distance - weighted metrics represent a mathematical approximation of the geographic market for every zip code and smooths variations across arbitrary geographic designations . We use these weighted measures for competitive density , environmental munificence , and the presence of complementary and other businesses . Competitive density . For the competitive density measure , we attempted to identify and geocode every performing arts organization in the US . We did this by cross - mapping all arts organizations reported by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) , DataArts , Theatre 2 We estimated distance - based attenuation for arts patronage using box office data for 84 arts organizations in five major US markets for 2 . 3 million households over 5 years . We geocoded every household and every arts organization and plotted patronage likelihood as a function of distance , applying an exponential power decay function , with parameters 𝛼𝛼 > 0 and 𝛽𝛽 > 0 : 𝑓𝑓 ( 𝑑𝑑 ) = 𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝑑𝑑 𝛽𝛽 ( e . g . , Halás , Klapka , and Kladivo 2014 ) , which produced the α = . 91 , β = . 46 parameters . 12 Communications Group ( TCG ) , and the League of American Orchestras ( LAO ) . The IRS provides the most complete data set , as we have tax return data for each year from every nonprofit performing arts organization required to file a tax return . DataArts collects data from nonprofit arts organizations that either voluntarily submit data to participate in the data collection effort or apply for funding from a grantmaker that requires submission of data . As service organizations , TCG and LAO conduct annual surveys of their members , with each organization receiving 100 - 300 completed surveys each year . The IRS , DataArts , and service organization data provide a census of nonprofit performing arts organizations , some 20 , 000 organizations geo - located at the zip code level . Figure 2 , Panel A provides a color - coded map of the geographic dispersion of activity ( i . e . , total expenses ) in our data set , aggregated to the county level . The key takeaway is that our data cover every US county that features significant nonprofit performing arts activity . - - - - - Insert Figure 2 about here - - - - - In Figure 3 , we demonstrate how the spatial model integrates competitor information from the local geographic market in Cook County , IL . This is for illustration only , as our data span the entire United States . The color coding in the map corresponds to the distance weighted measure for competitive density , which ranges from 2 to 81 . We show zip codes along with circles indicating the locations for all nonprofit performing arts organizations in Cook County . The largest number of organizations are located in zip codes 60640 ( 34 ) and 60657 ( 31 ) . A zip - code measure of competition would effectively discriminate the level of competition in these zip codes vis - à - vis zip code 60655 ( one organization ) in the southern Merrionett Park suburb and zip code 60070 ( one organization ) in the northern Prospect Heights suburb . But a zip code measure does not effectively represent the competitive density for the single organization located in zip 13 code 60612 in near West Side Chicago , which is proximate to zip code 60610 that has nine performing arts organizations . Nor does a county - level measure of competition ( 402 organizations in Cook County ) effectively discriminate the different levels of competitive density . In summary , the spatialized measure offers greater face validity than either the county or zip code level measures . 3 - - - - - Insert Figure 3 here - - - - - Geographic market controls . We used census data to construct three variables that control for other variations over time and across geographic markets . The environmental munificence factor includes measures of employment percentage , per capita income , percentage of households not in poverty , percentage of households with income over $ 150K , and percentage of individuals with bachelors and graduate degrees . Complementary business activity and all other business activity control for Jacobs ( 1969 ) diversity effects , which emerge if knowledge spillovers emanate from complementary or diverse industries ( Audretsch and Feldman 1996 ) . We identify complementary business activity based on empirical work by Porter ( 2003 ) , which found that hospitality and tourism was the only industry that overlapped with entertainment . The complementary business activity factor combines the employee - weighted number of bars , restaurants , and hotels per capita . 4 All other business activity is a per capita measure of the employee - weighted number of all businesses minus the employee - weighted number of theaters , dance , music organizations , bars , restaurants , and hotels . These measures are matched to the focal organization’s zip code using the decay function described above . 3 We also replicated all subsequent analyses using zip - code and county - level measures of competition . The results were similar but model fit criteria indicated that the distance - discounted measure fit the data better . 4 The environmental munificence and complementary business activity factors are formative as opposed to reflective constructs , but the coefficient alpha for both constructs was greater than . 70 . 14 Organization - level Measures All organization - level measures were provided by DataArts’ Cultural Data Profile , which includes financial information ( e . g . , revenues , expenses , balance sheet items ) and a range of non - financial information ( e . g . , attendance , space , pricing , program activity and staffing ) . The unbalanced panel includes data for 3 , 764 nonprofit performing arts organizations , covering 2010 - 2018 . The total number of observations is 17 , 500 ( ~ 5 years per organization on average ) . We now describe the mediating variable , two dependent variables , and control variables . Product innovation . We operationalize product innovation in the nonprofit performing arts as a count measure of the number of world premieres each organization introduced in the current and previous season . World premieres are new - to - the - world product offerings ( Lukas and Ferrell 2000 ) that align with March’s ( 1991 ) conceptualization of exploration and confer intellectual property rights . World premieres represent the most radical new offerings in the performing arts and are similar to the development of new films ( Eliashberg , Elberse , and Leenders 2006 ) . This operationalization aligns with our conceptual definition that focuses on the commitment of resources to the development of new product offerings . Traded market revenue . Performing arts organizations earn traded market revenue in two ways . The first way is to mount touring productions that travel to other cities . Dance companies , which tend to use prerecorded music and minimal sets , earn the highest level of tour revenue in our data . The second way to earn traded market revenue is through royalties , which flow to the creator of a new artwork for the right to mount subsequent productions . Royalty revenues are conceptually similar to licensing revenues in biomedical and technology industries and to innovation - driven franchising revenues ( Mallapragada and Srinivasan 2017 ) . Royalty 15 revenues are directly linked to product innovation and are critical to the success of many organizations in the creative and cultural industries ( Castaldi 2018 ) . Local market revenue . Performing arts organizations earn local market revenue through ticket sales and related concession sales associated with demand for the organization’s local offerings . Program revenue is directly attributable to local consumer demand associated with attending a performance and therefore corresponds to the economics of a local market , where intense , localized rivalry can dominate collocation benefits ( Seaman 2004 ) . Organization - level controls . We included several control variables in the analyses . Subsector dummy variables control for systematic differences between Dance ( 15 % of our sample ) , Music ( 25 % ) , Opera ( 5 % ) , Symphony ( 10 % ) , Theater ( 38 % ) , and Multidisciplinary Performing Arts organizations ( 7 % ) . Organization age and size control for the capacity to absorb and integrate benefits from competitive density as well as prior performance ( Eggers and Kaul 2018 ) . Age is the current fiscal year minus the reported founding date . Organization size is the lagged number of full - time ( hereafter FT ) employees , which is consistent with the operationalization of size in the literature ( Chandy and Tellis 2000 ; Jansen , Van den Bosch , and Volberda 2006 ; Morgan , Vorhees , and Mason 2009 ) . Additional control variables include the one - year lagged number of total offerings , which is a count measure of the total number of productions each year , the lagged average ticket price , and the lagged total spend on marketing . We log transform the continuous organization - level measures to improve the distribution and then mean - center them to simplify interpretation . Model Specification To test the hypotheses , we estimated models for each dependent variable separately and also as a system of equations . Both approaches produced similar results and we focus on the 16 independent model results here . These models include a random intercept at the organization level to control for unobserved heterogeneity and fixed effects for year and subsector .

For the local market revenue models , we assume a normal distribution for the error term and individual effects and maximize the residual maximum likelihood ( REML ) using a ridge - 5 Recall that product innovation is measured in the current ( t = 0 ) and previous ( t = - 1 ) season , and all independent variables for predicting product innovation are lagged one year ( t = - 1 ) . We use the product innovation measure combined with all other lagged independent variables to predict traded market revenue and local market revenue in the current ( t = 0 ) year . We explored different operationalizations of product innovation ( e . g . , one year or three years ) , which produced similar results . We lag geographic market variables because Census estimates correspond to the calendar year and the majority of the organizations in our sample report fiscal years ending between June and September , which implies that nearly half the activity and most decisions for fiscal year t = 0 likely occur during calendar year t = - 1 . 17 stabilized Newton - Raphson algorithm ( Lindstrom and Bates 1988 ) . The observed distributions for product innovation and traded market revenue are censored at zero . Specifically , only 2 , 204 of the 3 , 764 organizations ( ~ 59 % ) representing 9 , 300 of the 17 , 500 observations ( ~ 53 % ) reported at least one world premiere , and 1 , 406 organizations ( 29 % ) representing 3 , 396 observations ( 19 % ) reported positive trade market revenue . Given the large number of zeros for these two dependent variables , we estimated random - effects Tobit models with censoring at zero , implementing a Halton sequence with 100 draws ( Bhat 2001 ) . Results We present the results for a series of nested models for each dependent variable in Table 3 , corresponding to equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . These models allow us to assess mediating effects and explore systematic patterns that emerge for the geographic market variables . For simplicity , we use two - tailed t - tests when reporting significance levels . We do not show results for the subsector controls but note that dance followed by theater produced more world premieres and opera the least . Dance , followed by theater , earned more traded market revenue . Opera , followed by theater , earned more local market revenue . - - - - - Insert Table 3 about here - - - - - Examining Parameter Stability for the Control Variables For product innovation , we show a baseline model including only control variables ( Model 1 ) , a model that adds main effects for competitive density ( Model 2 ) , and the fully specified model that includes a quadratic effect for competitive density ( Model 3 ) . The parameter estimates for the geographic market controls are mostly stable , with environmental munificence an obvious exception . It exerts a strong positive effect ( p < . 001 ) on product innovation in the baseline model and negligible effects in Models 2 and 3 . This result suggests 18 that competitive density fully mediates the effect of environmental munificence on product innovation . Complementary business activity has a positive effect on product innovation ( p < . 001 ) , with the size of the effect substantially attenuated when competitive density is included . All other business activity has a negative effect on product innovation ( p < . 001 ) . Because complementary and all other business activity are positively correlated ( see Table 2 ) , we examined whether the opposite signs are an artifact of collinearity . Collinearity diagnostics do not indicate a problem ( largest condition index in the two models is 3 . 5 and largest VIF = 3 . 0 for complementary business activity ) , which suggests that other business activity acts as a suppressor variable ( Friedman and Wall 2005 ) . We see a similar pattern of results for the geographic market control variables in the traded market analyses , which include a baseline model with only control variables ( Model 4 ) , a model that adds main and quadratic effects for product innovation ( Model 5 ) , a model that adds main and quadratic effects for competitive density ( Model 6 ) , and a fully specified model that includes all effects ( Model 7 ) . Environmental munificence has a strong positive coefficient in Model 4 ( β = 1 . 082 , p < . 001 ) , which is substantially attenuated ( β = . 462 , p < . 10 ) with the addition of the competitive density coefficient in Model 6 . There is similar but smaller attenuation of the positive effects for complementary business activity and for the negative effects for all other business activity ( p < . 05 in Model 4 and not significant in Models 5 - 7 ) . Turning to the local market revenue models , we again see significant changes for the environmental munificence and complementary business activity factors across models . Specifically , the effects for environmental munificence and complementary business activity are nonsignificant in baseline Model 8 and become significantly positive ( p < . 001 ) when competitive density is added ( Models 10 and 11 ) . All other business activity has consistently 19 positive effects ( p < . 001 ) on local market revenue . All of these results are robust to one by one elimination of the control variables , and diagnostics again indicate no collinearity concerns . In summary , the empirical models effectively isolate and control for the positive and negative effects of increasing economic density . Competitive density mediates the positive effect of environmental munificence and complementary business activity on both product innovation and traded market revenue . This result is logical because dynamic cities do not innovate , excel , and generate exports in every industry , only in industries that cluster in the city , supported by complementary industries . The positive and negative effects of other business activity are relatively unaffected by competitive density in the focal industry . Examining Parameter Stability for Organizational Control Variables The organizational controls are generally stable across nested models for each dependent variable with some logical differences across dependent variables . In the product innovation models , organization size has a positive effect ( p < . 001 ) and organization age has a negative effect ( p < . 001 ) . Total number of offerings , which controls for activity levels , has a positive effect on product innovation ( p < . 001 ) . Average ticket price has no effect , and marketing spend has a small , positive effect . In the traded market revenue models , organization size and age have consistently positive effects ( p < . 001 ) . Both log - log coefficients are greater than one , indicating increasing returns to size and age for traded market revenue . The positive effect of total offerings is attenuated when product innovation is added ( Models 5 and 7 ) . Average ticket price has no effect , and marketing spend has consistently positive effects . Organizational control variable effects are consistently positive in the local market revenue models . The positive elasticity for price is consistent with nonprofit organizations 20 setting price points below profit maximizing levels . The size of the marketing spend elasticity ( . 039 ) is consistent with estimates of short - term advertising elasticities ( Sethuraman , Tellis , and Briesch 2011 ) . Hypothesis Tests The pattern of results for the control variables supports measurement validity and overall model specification , so we now turn to the hypothesis tests . Consistent with H1 , competitive density has diminishing positive effects on product innovation , with a strong positive main effect ( β = . 338 , p < . 001 ) and a small negative quadratic effect ( β = - . 029 , p < . 05 ) . The AIC indicates that adding competitive density improves the fit for Model 2 compared to Model 1 and that adding the quadratic improves the fit for Model 3 compared to Models 2 and 1 . This result is consistent with Goettler and Gordon’s ( 2014 ) analytic results and establishes necessary conditions for product innovation’s role as a mediating variable . The results in Models 5 and 7 ( traded market revenue as dependent variable ) provide preliminary support for H2a , which predicted a decreasing positive effect for product innovation on traded market revenue . The product innovation coefficient is significantly positive ( p < . 001 ) and the quadratic coefficient is significantly negative ( p < . 001 ) . The AIC also indicates that , compared to the baseline , model fit is improved by the addition of the product innovation parameters . The graph in Figure 4 , Panel A shows an inverted U - shaped relationship between product innovation and traded market revenue , with traded market revenue maximized when product innovation is moderate . Very low and very high levels of product innovation are associated with near - zero traded market revenue . - - - - - Insert Figure 4 about here - - - - - 21 The results for Models 9 and 11 ( local market revenue as dependent variable ) in Table 3 offer qualified support for H2b , which predicted a decreasingly positive effect for product innovation on local market revenue . The product innovation coefficient is significantly positive ( p < . 001 ) and the quadratic coefficient is negative but not significant . The AIC indicates that the addition of the product innovation parameters does not improve model fit . The results in traded market revenue Models 6 and 7 offer support for H3a . Even though the quadratic coefficient for competitive density is not significant , the main effect is significantly positive and greater than one ( β = 1 . 294 , p < . 001 in Model 7 ) . Because these are log - log coefficients , an elasticity estimate greater than one is consistent with the presence of increasing returns to competitive density for traded market revenue . The AIC indicates that adding the competitive density terms improves model fit . We also note that the stronger results for the main effect of competitive density in Model 6 ( β = 1 . 494 ) add further support for increasing returns . A Sobel ( 1982 ; see also Zhao , Lynch , and Chen 2010 ) test supports the presence of a significant ( p < . 001 ) indirect effect for competitive density on traded market revenue , mediated by product innovation . Panel B in Figure 4 plots the direct and total effects . To generate the two curves , we use the coefficients from Model 6 in Table 3 for total effects and the coefficients from Model 7 in Table 3 for the direct effects . The plot assumes a larger and older dance company engaged in an average level of product innovation operating in a munificent market . The resulting plot demonstrates a dramatic effect for competitive density . Expected traded market revenue is zero except in the most competitively dense markets . The mediating effect of product innovation ( i . e . , the total effect minus the direct effect of competitive density ) is quite strong . Figure 2 , Panel B , which shows the geographic dispersion of traded market revenue , offers model - free support for these empirical results . Traded market revenue exists in many markets 22 but is much more concentrated in competitively dense markets than is activity for the panel as a whole . As a result , the latent variable underlying the Tobit model becomes positive only when competitive density is very high . The results in Models 10 and 11 support H3b , which predicted an increasingly negative effect for competitive density on local market revenue . The competitive density coefficient is significantly negative ( p < . 001 ) and the quadratic coefficient is also negative ( p < . 001 ) . The AIC indicates that adding the competitive density terms improves the fit for Model 10 compared to baseline Model 8 . Panel C in Figure 4 offers greater insight into the relationship between competitive density , product innovation , and local market revenue . The first take - away is that the relationship between competitive density and local market revenue is not monotonically negative ; instead , the effect is initially positive , with local market revenue peaking between four and five competitors , and then turning increasingly negative . The second take - away is that the mediating effect of product innovation ( i . e . , the total effect minus the direct effect of competitive density ) is negative at low levels of competitive density and negligible at high levels of competitive density . This explains why the addition of the product innovation effect does not result in a significant change to the direct competition coefficient ( consistent with a Sobel test ) and why the AIC shows no improvement when product innovation is added to model . Discussion We began by identifying countervailing externalities that obscure the effects of competitive density on product innovation and market performance , leading to seemingly contradictory directional results in prior empirical research . To address these contradictions , we borrowed from the economics literature to explicate the distinction between traded and local 23 market revenues . Surprisingly , no empirical research to date has explicitly isolated the effect of competitive density on traded and local market revenues . Our results offer implications for researchers and managers . Research Implications The unambiguous , positive effects for competitive density on product innovation and traded market revenue support the existence of geographically - mediated knowledge spillovers ( see Figure 4 , Panel B ) . We believe these results are broadly generalizable , because increasing returns to traded market revenue align with economic theory and empirical regularities that emerge at multiple levels of analysis , including individual workers ( Davis and Dingel 2019 ) , organizations and sectors ( Gaubert 2018 ) , entire cities ( Behrens , Duranton , and Robert - Nicoud 2014 ; Combes et al . 2012 ) , and states ( Ciccone and Hall 1996 ) . Increasing returns to traded market revenues are especially relevant to knowledge economy competitors , where low transportation costs associated with digital offerings facilitate diffusion of offerings to geographically dispersed markets . Isolating the positive effects of knowledge spillovers on traded market revenues and the negative effects of product market rivalry on local market revenues helps us understand equivocal results in prior research . A closer examination of the effects of competitive density on market performance enriches the marketing literature , where there is a long record of research examining the role of competitive intensity and competitor orientation ( e . g . , Jaworski and Kohli 1993 ; Morgan , Vorhies , and Mason 2009 ; Slater and Narver 1994 ) but relatively little examining the role of competitive density . The finding that key antecedent variables influence performance in systematically different ways depending on the spatial structure of the market provides fresh insight for specifying moderating effects that go beyond simple fixed effects for industry . 24 The results also contribute to a debate that is frequently cast as Marshall specialization versus Jacobs diversity effects ( Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009 ) . Jacobs ( 1969 ) argues that the most important sources of knowledge spillovers are external to the focal firm’s industry , but other researchers propose that collocating close to complementary , as opposed to strictly diverse , industries creates externalities for knowledge - based industries ( Audretsch and Feldman 1996 ) . Because we simultaneously include effects for direct competition , complementary activity , and all other business activity , our study disentangles these potentially confounded effects . The negative effect for other business activity on product innovation and insignificant effect on traded market revenue offer evidence against knowledge spillovers from diverse industries . The positive effect for other business activity on local market revenue supports the importance of infrastructure and market proximity , urbanization externalities that facilitate access to local customers ( Priem , Li , and Carr 2012 ) . These results are consistent with arguments that diversity generates knowledge spillovers only if sectors are technologically close enough so that inventions in one sector are relevant in the other industry ( Combes 2000 ) . Summarizing the competitive density effects , we find strong support for within - industry knowledge spillovers that enhance product innovation and traded market revenue . These positive effects do not extend to local market revenue , where rivalry dominates . Complementary business activity exerts positive effects on product innovation , traded and local market revenues . Diverse business activity provides positive local demand effects , likely attributable to infrastructure and market proximity , but no positive knowledge spillover effects . The inverted U - shaped relationship between product innovation and traded market revenues offers striking support for the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation 25 ( e . g . , March 1991 ) . World premieres are the most radical form of innovation in the performing arts , consistent with March’s ( 1991 , p . 71 ) description of exploration as “variation , risk taking , experimentation , play , flexibility , discovery , innovation . ” Most performing arts productions have been produced elsewhere ; these offerings match March’s ( 1991 , p . 71 ) conceptualization of exploitation as “refinement , choice , production , efficiency , selection , implementation , execution . ” Because we include the total number of productions as a control variable , the results for product innovation can be interpreted as the relative focus on innovation or exploration on revenue . Our expectation was that product innovation would have a decreasingly positive , monotonic relationship with both sources of revenue . Instead , traded market revenue is maximized at medium levels of product innovation , which represents a balance between exploration and exploitation . The finding that some organizations overinvest in product innovation despite little or no return is consistent with prior research documenting a mismatch between motivation and ability to successfully innovate ( Eggers and Kaul 2018 ) . Managerial Implications The main managerial insight that emerges from this research is that dense overlapping networks of talent are critical to the success of product innovation . For performing arts organizations , locating in high competitive density markets is essential for access to talent and generating traded market revenue . At the same time , organizations in high competitive density markets should be prepared to face challenges from local rivals . An intriguing paradox is that organizations may find entry into low competitive density markets easier but that such markets may not support product innovation or access to traded market revenue . The results also reaffirm the important role played by older , larger organizations . These organizations are most successful at generating local and , especially , traded market revenues . 26 The path of a new work of art may begin in the periphery but success requires an established organization possessing the requisite capabilities and operating in a competitively dense market . For established performing arts organizations , the results with respect to product innovation stress the importance of balance in programming . Organizations with a disproportional focus on product innovation may play a vital role in stimulating sector - wide innovation , but they are not successful in commercializing innovations for their own benefit . The greatest success in commercializing product innovation accrues to organizations that engage in moderate levels of innovation within a balanced portfolio of offerings . In the performing arts , this result may reflect artistic missions dedicated to innovation for innovation’s sake rather than a financial objective . Limitations and Future Research Given our focus on the nonprofit performing arts , we were not able to fully investigate all boundary conditions for the competitive density effect . Spatial ecology and economics , where extensive research focuses on density and dispersion , offer valuable insights to direct a search for boundary conditions . In spatial ecology , density dependent dispersal occurs when competition for local resources forces a species to migrate elsewhere . Moderate levels of dispersal promote the greatest levels of biodiversity in a community and low dispersion leads to low average productivity , a single dominant species in each community , and relatively high variability across communities ( Loreau , Mouquet , and Gonzalez 2003 ) . Applying this line of thinking to spatial economics with traded revenue representing dispersal in the economic system , medium levels of traded revenue maximize local diversity . In the performing arts , where traded revenue is globally much lower than local revenue , high competitive - density markets ( where there is more traded revenue but still less than local revenue ) feature more diverse and dynamic ecologies and 27 low competitive - density markets ( where there is no dispersal in the form of traded revenue ) feature single dominant organizations with high variability in quality across communities . These insights are consistent with the results in the current study . Our empirical context does not allow examination of the opposite extreme , that is , industries where dispersal in the form of traded revenues exceed local revenues . Under these conditions , spatial ecology would predict global competitive exclusion and homogenization of the entire metacommunity ( Loreau , Mouquet , and Gonzalez 2003 ) . We see this in the automobile industry , where a small number of relatively large , homogeneous manufacturers tend to collocate and compete with one another in most geographic markets , and similar patterns in Silicon Valley internet competitors and Hollywood film competitors , albeit mitigated by the effects of culture and language . These agglomerations feature expected concentrations of competitors , employees , and support industries ( Chatterji , Glaeser , and Kerr 2014 ; Klepper 2010 ) . Increasing returns to traded market revenue likely exist . Our arguments for a positive impact of competitive density on traded market revenue rely on overlapping networks as a theoretical mechanism . Although we do not directly observe these networks , there is strong anecdotal and empirical evidence that overlap does occur . The average organization in our sample contracted 51 artists per year on a temporary basis , and successful artists tend to work at three or more organizations per year , under contracts lasting nine weeks . These conditions and the empirical results are remarkably consistent with Davis and Dingel’s ( 2019 ) “Spatial Knowledge Economy , ” in which high - skill individuals generating tradable outputs benefit most from ( and therefore migrate to ) large cities whereas low - skill individuals generating non - tradable outputs do not benefit from those effects . Our results indicate similar effects at the organization level . It remains an open question whether competitively dense 28 markets attract better talent or whether the competitive processes in competitively dense markets produce more innovative organizations . The positive effects for complementary business activity on product innovation , traded and local market revenues provide strong support for the important role played by complementary industries ( Audretsch and Feldman 1996 ) . Unfortunately , our results do not allow inferences with respect to process . For example , it may be that the presence of large numbers of bars , restaurants , and hotels simply facilitates intense , face - to - face interactions that allow knowledge spillovers to flourish . Alternatively , the employment opportunities at bars , restaurants , and hotels for temporarily out - of - work dancers , actors , musicians , designers , and directors may cultivate and sustain social as well as economic networks . Future research could explore the extent to which local market rivalry effects uncovered here extend to the broader retail sector . Retail collocation is common , taking various forms such as shopping malls , food courts , and repetitive strip malls , and empirical evidence suggests some benefits to retail collocation ( Arentze , Oppewal , and Timmermans 2005 ; Ozturk , Venkatraman , and Chintagunta 2016 ; Thill 1986 ) . It would be instructive to explore more closely which types of retail may benefit from collocation and at what level of competitive density rivalry effects dominate collocation benefits . The extent to which the retail store location decision is endogenous may moderate this relationship ( e . g . , Aguirregabiria and Suzuki , 2014 ; Orhun , 2013 ; Zhu and Singh , 2009 ) . For example , Datta and Sudhir ( 2013 ) demonstrate that some competitive concentration is induced by zoning regulations , which is related to the current study in that cities commonly designate art districts . Finally , our results with respect to competitive density , product innovation , market performance , and organization size and age offer insights for future research . Chandy and Tellis 29 ( 2000 ) dispelled the myth of the “incumbent’s curse” and documented that larger , incumbent organizations introduced the majority of innovations after World War II . They speculated that dynamic organizational structures and strong technological capabilities keep these organizations nimble . We speculate that density of economic activity and traded market exchange , both of which accelerated post World War II , also play a role . Older organizations in our study exhibited less product innovation , consistent with the incumbent’s curse , but were far more successful commercializing their product innovation in traded markets , consistent with Chandy and Tellis’s results . But older and larger performing arts organizations were successful commercializing their product innovations only if they were located in competitively dense markets . We encourage future research that explicitly examines the links between competitive density , organization age and size , absorptive capacity , and innovation success . 30 References Aguirregabiria , V . , & Suzuki , J .

The size of the red circles corresponds to the relative percentage of the total expenses and traded revenue for our sample , aggregated to the county level . Population of competitors Population of competitors 43 Figure 3 Visual Depiction of Competitive Density in Cook County , Illinois * * This is for illustration only , as our data span the entire United States . Competitive density is the weighted sum of all competitors within 50 kilometers , discounted by distance using the exponential power decay function 𝑓𝑓 ( 𝑑𝑑 ) = 𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝑑𝑑 𝛽𝛽 , where α = . 91 and β = . 46 . Total number of competitors in Cook County is 402 . The spatialized number of competitors located within 50 kilometers , including competitors in adjacent counties , ranges from 2 - 81 . 44 Figure 4 Plotting the Effects of Product Innovation and Competitive Density on Traded and Local Market Revenues * Panel A : Direct Effect of Product Innovation on Traded Market Revenue Panel B : Total & Direct Effects of Competitive Density ( Mediated by Product Innovation ) on Traded Market Revenue Panel C : Total & Direct Effects of Competitive Density ( Mediated by Product Innovation ) on Local Market Revenue * All plots show effects for larger , older organizations and the competitive density plots show effects for organizations engaging in an average level of product innovation in munificent markets . For total effects , we use the coefficients from Models 6 and 10 in Table 3 for traded and local market revenue , respectively , and for direct effects , we use the coefficients from Models 7 and 11 in Table 3 for traded and local market revenue , respectively . The indirect effects of competitive density ( mediated by innovation activity ) can be inferred from the distance between direct and total effects . $ 0 $ 20 $ 40 $ 60 $ 80 $ 100 $ 120 Low High T r a d e d M a r k e t R e v e nu e ( 000 s ) Product Innovation $ 0 $ 20 $ 40 $ 60 $ 80 $ 100 $ 120 Low High T r a d e d M a r k e t R e v e nu e ( 000 s ) Competitive Density Total effects Direct effects $ 500 $ 1 , 000 $ 1 , 500 $ 2 , 000 Low High L o c a l M a r k e t R e v e nu e ( 000 s ) Competitive Density Total effects Direct effects
