unspliced RNA in the cytoplasm ( 23 , 24 ) is not supported by the observation that the majority of these do not accumulate significantly in a upf3 D strain [ suppl . fig . 3 ( 7 ) ] . The expectation based on intronic small nucleolar RNA – pro - cessing phenotypes that accumulation of in - trons in the dbr1 D mutant should be inversely related to intron size ( 25 ) seems not to hold either , most likely because of Dbr1p - indepen - dent mechanisms of intron turnover ( suppl . fig . 4 ) . We do not observe correlation between a nonconsensus 5 9 splice site or a U - rich region near the 5 9 splice site and strong dependence on Nam8p ( 26 ) for splicing in vivo ( Suppl . figs . 5 and 6 ) . We also see no correlation between the presence of a U residue upstream of the branch - point sequence ( 27 ) or the presence of a poly - pyrimidine tract before or after the branchpoint and strong dependence on Mud2p ( suppl . figs . 7 and 8 ) . These data indicate that using any one intron as a reporter may cause the importance of a factor to be overemphasized or missed . Genomewide analysis allows perturbations of splicing to be evaluated on every intron at once , in effect using the entire genome as a reporter . These studies present the first genome - wide view of splicing for any organism . The ability to distinguish differently spliced forms of RNA by using oligonucleotide microarrays opens the way for expression profiling that accounts for alternative splicing and splicing regulation in higher cells . Estimates suggest that 40 to 60 % of human genes produce alternatively spliced transcripts ( 28 , 29 ) . In a growing number of key cases , alternatively spliced mRNAs produce proteins of distinct or even antagonistic function [ e . g . ( 30 ) ] . Im - proved expression profiling technologies must resolve changes in alternative splicing not simply by estimating exon representation [ e . g . ( 31 ) ] , but by providing direct evidence for exon joining . The results we describe here demonstrate that oligonucleotide arrays de - signed to detect specific splicing products will be key to accurate parallel analysis of alternative splicing in higher organisms .

The splice junction ( SJ ) index is the ratio of the mutant / wild - type ratios derived from the normal - ized signals from the splice junction probe to the exon 2 probe : SJ index 5 SJ mut / SJ wt divided by E2 mut / E2 wt , obtained by subtracting the log 2 ratio of the exon 2 probe from the log 2 ratio of the splice junction probe . The intron accumulation ( IA ) index is obtained by subtracting the log 2 ratio of the exon 2 probe from the log 2 ratio of the intron probe . Because probe performance may not be directly related to absolute transcript amount , these indexes depend idiosyncratically on the se - quences of the probes . We also calculated the precursor / mature ( PM ) index , which is obtained by subtracting the log 2 ratio of the splice junction probe from the log 2 ratio of the intron probe . This index mimics the unspliced / spliced ratio used in classical splicing studies ( 15 ) . 15 . C . W . Pikielny , M . Rosbash , Cell 41 , 119 ( 1985 ) . 16 . H . V . Colot , F . Stutz , M .

To address topological properties of these two networks , we quan - ti(cid:222)ed correlations between connectivities of interacting nodes and compared them to a null model of a network , in which all links were randomly rewired . We found that for both interaction and regulatory networks , links between highly connected proteins are systematically suppressed , whereas those be - tween a highly connected and low - connected pairs of proteins are favored . This effect decreases the likelihood of cross talk between different functional mod - ules of the cell and increases the overall robustness of a network by localizing effects of deleterious perturbations . With the growth of experimental information about basic biochemical mechanisms of life , molecular networks operating in living cells are becoming better defined . Direct physical interactions between pairs of proteins form one such network , which serves as a back - bone for functional and structural relation - ships among its nodes and defines pathways for the propagation of various signals such as phosphorylation and allosteric regulation of proteins . The information about specific binding of proteins to each other has recently grown by an unprecedented amount as a re - sult of high - throughput two - hybrid experi - ments ( 1 , 2 ) . The production and degradation of proteins participating in the interaction network is controlled by the genetic regula - tory network of the cell , formed by all pairs of proteins in which the first protein directly regulates the abundance of the second . The majority of known cases of such regulation happens at the level of transcription , in which a transcription factor positively or negatively regulates the RNA transcription of the con - trolled protein .

One may wonder how such a heavily intertwined and mutually de - pendent dynamical system can perform mul - tiple functional tasks and still remain stable against deleterious perturbations . We analyzed the topological properties of interaction and transcription regulatory net - works in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which at present is perhaps the best charac - terized model organism . The interaction net - work used in this study consists of 4549 physical interactions between 3278 yeast pro - teins as measured in the most comprehensive two - hybrid screen of yeast proteins ( 2 ) , whereas the genetic regulatory network is formed by 1289 directed positive or negative direct transcriptional regulations within a set of 682 proteins as listed in the Yeast Protein Database ( Incyte Genomics , Palo Alto , CA ) ( 3 ) . The protein interaction network is a rep - resentative of the broad class of scale - free networks ( 4 – 6 ) in which the number of nodes with a given number of neighbors ( connec - tivity ) K scales as a power law } 1 / K g . In our case the histogram of connectivities can be fitted by a power law with g 5 2 . 5 6 0 . 3 for K ranging from 2 to about 100 ( 7 , 8 ) . A small part of the protein interaction network , formed by proteins known to be localized in the nucleus and to interact with at least one other nuclear protein , was visualized ( Fig . 1 ) . One remarkable feature of this graph is the abundance of highly connected proteins that are mostly connected to those with low con - nectivity , and thus well separated from each other . To test for correlations in connectivities of nodes for each of the above two networks , we calculated the likelihood P ( K 0 , K 1 ) that two proteins with connectivities K 0 and K 1 are connected to each other by a link and com - pared it to the same quantity P r ( K 0 , K 1 ) mea - sured in a randomized version of the same network . In this “null model” network , all proteins have exactly the same connectivity as in the original one , whereas the choice of their interaction partners is totally random . The transcription regulatory network is natu - rally directed , whereas the network of phys - ical interactions among proteins in principle lacks directionality . However , for poorly un - derstood reasons , the two - hybrid experimen - tal data have a significant asymmetry be - tween baits and preys , with bait hybrids being more likely to be highly connected than their prey counterparts . This can be seen , e . g . , in the fact that average connectivity of baits with at least one interaction partner is close to 3 , whereas the same quantity measured for preys is only 1 . 8 . Because each reported in - teraction involves one bait and one prey pro - tein , this asymmetry needs to be taken into account when constructing an uncorrelated “null” model for the interaction network . For this purpose , in our randomization procedure we would treat the two - hybrid data as a di - rected network with an arrow on each edge pointing out from bait to prey hybrid . Ran - domized versions of these two networks were constructed by randomly reshuffling links , while keeping the in - and out - degree of each node constant . A convenient numerical algo - rithm performing such randomization con - sists of first randomly selecting a pair of directed edges A 3 B and C 3 D . The two edges are then rewired in such a way that A becomes connected to D , while C connects to B . However , in case one or both of these new links already exist in the network , this step is aborted and a new pair of edges is selected . This last restriction prevents the appearance of multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes . A repeated application of the above rewiring step leads to a randomized version of the original network . Multiple sampling of randomized networks allowed us to calculate both the average expectation and the standard deviation for any particular property of the random network . Correlations in connectivities manifest themselves as systematic deviations of the ratio P ( K 0 , K 1 ) / P r ( K 0 , K 1 ) from 1 . We calcu - Fig . 1 . Network of physical interactions be - tween nuclear proteins . Here , we show the part of the network reported in ( 2 ) , consist - ing of all proteins that are known to be localized in the yeast nucleus ( 3 ) , and which interact with at least one other protein in the nucleus . This subset consists of 318 interac - tions between 329 proteins . Note that most neighbors of highly connected nodes have rather low connectivity . Fig . 2 . Correlation pro(cid:222)les of protein interaction and regulatory networks in yeast . ( A ) The ratio P ( K 0 , K 1 ) / P r ( K 0 , K 1 ) , where P ( K 0 , K 1 ) is the probability that a pair of proteins with total numbers of interaction partners given by K 0 , K 1 correspondingly , directly interact with each other in the full set of ( 2 ) , while P r ( K 0 , K 1 ) is the same probability in a randomized version of the same network .

( D ) As in ( C ) , but for incoming and outgoing links in the the transcription regulatory network . To improve statistics , the connectivities in all four panels of this (cid:222)gure were logarithmically binned into 2 bins per decade . R E P O R T S www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 296 3 MAY 2002 911 lated this ratio for interaction ( Fig . 2A ) and regulatory ( Fig . 2B ) networks , with K 0 and K 1 being the total number of interaction part - ners of two interacting proteins ( for the inter - action network ) , and out - and in - degrees of two nodes connected by a directed edge 0 3 1 ( for the regulatory network ) . Thus , by the very construction , P ( K 0 , K 1 ) is symmetric for the physical interaction network but not for the regulatory network . We also estimated the statistical significance Z ( K 0 , K 1 ) of the above deviations in the interaction ( Fig . 2C ) and regulatory ( Fig . 2D ) networks , by divid - ing each observed deviation from the null model by the standard deviation in multiple realizations of a randomized network . The combination of these two plots reveals the regions on the K 0 - K 1 plane , where connec - tions between proteins in the real network are significantly enhanced or suppressed , com - pared to the null model . In particular , red regions in the upper left and the lower right corners reflect the tendency of highly con - nected nodes ( hubs ) to associate with nodes of low connectivity , while the blue / green re - gion in the upper right corner reflects the reduced likelihood that two hub centers are directly linked to each other . One should also note a prominent feature on the diagonal of Fig . 2 , A and C , corresponding to an en - hanced affinity of proteins with between four and nine interaction partners to physically interact with each other . This feature can be tentatively attributed to the tendency of mem - bers of multiprotein complexes to interact with other proteins from the same complex . The above range of connectivities thus cor - responds to a typical number of direct inter - action partners of a protein in a complex . When we checked for interactions between proteins in this range of connectivities , we found 39 pairs of interacting proteins to be - long to the same complex in a recent high - throughput study ( 9 ) , which is four times more than one would expect to find by pure chance alone . To further quantify and compare corre - lation patterns in interaction and regulatory networks , we calculated the average con - nectivity ^ K 1 & of nearest neighbors of a node , as a function of its own connectivity K 0 ( Fig . 3A ) . In order to simplify the com - parison between two networks here , we characterize each node in the regulatory network by its total number of neighbors K 5 K in 1 K out . For both interaction and regulatory networks , the average connec - tivity ^ K 1 & shows a gradual decline with K 0 , which can be fitted with a power law ^ K 1 & } 1 / K 00 . 6 6 0 . 1 over approximately two de - cades . This observation gives an additional credit to the affinity between correlation patterns in these two protein networks vis - ible in Fig . 2 . It was recently found ( 10 ) that the internet , defined as the set of inter - connected routers , in addition to a scale - free distribution of node connectivities sim - ilar to the protein interaction network , is characterized by the same correlation pat - tern between connectivities of neighboring nodes : ^ K 1 & } 1 / K 00 . 5 . This extends by one step an intriguing similarity in the topology of these networks of completely different nature . For the scale - free physical interaction net - work , we also plotted the probability distri - bution of the nearest - neighbor connectivity K 1 , measured separately for nodes with small connectivity K 0 # 3 , and for those with large connectivity K 0 $ 100 ( Fig . 3B ) . In the absence of correlations , this conditional prob - ability does not depend on K 0 and is propor - tional to K 1 / K 1 g ; 1 / K 11 . 5 . This uncorrelated form holds approximately true for neighbors of a protein with low connectivity . It is only violated at the far tail of the distribution due to an excess likelihood of it being connected to a protein with very high connectivity , as was mentioned above . On the other hand , the distribution of connectivities K 1 of neighbors of highly connected proteins scales as } 1 / K 12 . 5 and thus differs from that of lowly connected ones by a factor of 1 / K 1 . When analyzing molecular networks , one should consider possible sources of errors in the underlying data . Two - hybrid experiments give rise to false positives of two kinds . In one case , the interaction between proteins is real but it never happens in the course of the normal life cycle of the cell , due to spatial or temporal separation of participating proteins . In another case , an indirect physical interac - tion is mediated by one or more unknown proteins localized in the yeast nucleus . Con - versely , in a high - throughput two - hybrid screen , one should expect a sizeable number of false negatives . Primarily , a binding may not be observed if the conformation of the bait or prey heterodimer blocks relevant in - teraction sites or if the corresponding het - erodimer altogether fails to fold properly . Secondly , 391 proteins out of the potential 5671 baits in ( 2 ) were not tested as possible bait hybrids , because they were found to ac - tivate transcription of the reporter gene in the absence of any prey proteins . Unlike for the interaction network , our data for the genetic regulatory network do not come from a single large - scale project . In - stead , they derive from a collection of numer - ous experiments performed with different ex - perimental techniques in different labs . Therefore , it is not feasible even to list pos - sible sources of errors present in such a di - verse data set . In particular , one should worry about a hidden anthropomorphic factor present in such a network : Some proteins just constitute more attractive subjects of research and are , therefore , relatively better studied than others . One should also note that the transcription regulation network is only a subset of a larger genetic regulatory network , which in addition to transcriptional regulation includes translational regulation , RNA edit - ing , and so forth . An encouraging sign was that when we separately analyzed the set representing the current knowledge ( 3 ) about this later more complete network , consisting of 1750 genetic regulations among 848 pro - teins , we reproduced all of our empirical results for the transcriptional network . The observed suppression of connections between nearest neighbors of highly connected proteins is consistent with compartmentaliza - tion and modularity characteristic of control of many cellular processes ( 11 ) . In fact , it suggests the picture of functional modules of the cell organized around individual hubs . To further test the extent of modularity of hubs and their immediate neighborhood in each network , we selected 15 highest connected nodes . To pro - Fig . 3 .

R E P O R T S 3 MAY 2002 VOL 296 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 912 vide an unbiased sample of hubs from the point of view of in - and out - connectivity , half of those nodes were selected as the highest out - degree hubs ( 8 baits with K bait $ 90 for the interaction network and 7 nodes with K out $ 34 for the regulatory network ) , while half were the highest in - degree hubs ( 7 preys with K prey $ 20 for the interaction network and 8 nodes with K out $ 8 for the regulatory network ) . In agree - ment with the correlation properties described above , direct connections between hubs were significantly suppressed . In the interaction net - work , we observed 20 links between different hubs in this group , which is significantly below 56 6 7 . 5 links in the randomized network . In the transcription regulatory network , there were 16 links between hubs in real network , as op - posed to 35 6 6 . 5 in its randomized version . Not only are direct links between hubs sup - pressed in both studied networks , but hubs also tend to share fewer of their neighbors with other hubs , thereby extending their isolation to the level of next - nearest neighbor connections . The total number of paths of length 2 between the set of 15 hubs in the interaction network is equal to 418 , whereas in the null model we measured this number to be 653 6 56 . Simi - larly , for the transcriptional network the number of paths of length 2 is equal to 186 in the real network , whereas from the null model one ex - pects it to be 262 6 30 . Since the number of paths of length 2 between a pair of proteins is equal to the number of their common interac - tion partners , one concludes that both the hub node itself and its immediate surroundings tend to separate from other hubs , reinforcing the picture of functional modules clustered around individual hubs . A further implication of the observed corre - lation is in the suppression of the propagation of deleterious perturbations over the network . It is reasonable to assume that certain perturbations such as , e . g . , significant changes in the concen - tration of a given protein ( including its vanish - ing altogether in a null - mutant cell ) with a ceratin probability can affect its first , second , and sometimes even more distant neighbors in the corresponding network . While the number of immediate neighbors of a node is by defini - tion equal to its own connectivity K 0 , the aver - age number of its second neighbors , given by K 0 ^ ( K 1 – 1 ) & K 0 , is sensitive to correlation pat - terns of the network . Because highly connected nodes serve as powerful amplifiers for the prop - agation of deleterious perturbations , it is espe - cially important to suppress this propagation beyond their immediate neighbors . It was ar - gued that scale - free networks in general are very vulnerable to attacks aimed at highly con - nected nodes ( 12 , 13 ) . The anticorrelation pre - sented above implies a reduced branching ratio around these nodes and thus provides a certain degree of protection against such attacks . This may be the reason why the correlation between the connectivity of a given protein and the lethality of the mutant cell lacking this protein is not particularly strong ( 8 ) . It is feasible that molecular networks in a living cell have organized themselves in an interaction pattern that is both robust and specific . Topologically , the specificity of dif - ferent functional modules can be enhanced by limiting interactions between hubs and sup - pressing the average connectivity of their neighbors . We have seen that such a correla - tion pattern appears in a similar way in two different layers of molecular networks in yeast , and thus presumably is a universal feature of all molecular networks operating in living cells .

Tsien 1 , 3 ‡ Many proteins associated with the plasma membrane are known to partition into submicroscopic sphingolipid - and cholesterol - rich domains called lipid rafts , but the determinants dictating this segregation of proteins in the mem - brane are poorly understood . We suppressed the tendency of Aequorea (cid:223)uo - rescent proteins to dimerize and targeted these variants to the plasma mem - brane using several different types of lipid anchors . Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements in living cells revealed that acyl but not prenyl modi(cid:222)cations promote clustering in lipid rafts . Thus the nature of the lipid anchor onaproteinissuf(cid:222)cient todeterminesubmicroscopic localization within the plasma membrane . Subcellular compartmentalization of signal - ing increases the specificity and efficiency of signal transduction . Caveolae and lipid rafts are related microdomains of the plasma mem - brane that are enriched in cholesterol , sphin - golipids , and many signaling proteins ( 1 , 2 ) . Whereas protein - protein interactions main - tain many signaling complexes ( 3 , 4 ) , specif - ic lipid modifications are believed sufficient to sequester proteins in lipid rafts and caveo - lae . In particular , acylated proteins may pref - erentially partition into these compartments ( 5 , 6 ) . Unambiguous observation of these small ( , 100 - nm ) microdomains in living cells is beyond the resolution of visible light microscopy ; thus destructive assays such as cellular fractionation ( 7 ) or immunolocaliza - tion by electron microscopy ( 8 ) have been relied upon to study lipid rafts and caveolae . We now use fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) between nondimerizing cyan ( CFP ) and yellow ( YFP ) variants of Ae - quorea green fluorescent protein ( 9 , 10 ) to show which lipid modifications are sufficient to cause such test proteins to aggregate within lipid rafts inside living cells .
