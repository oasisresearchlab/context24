The grounded perspective offers a uni - fying view of cognition . It stresses dynamic brain - body - environment interactions and perception - action links as the common bases of simple behaviors as well as complex cog - nitive and social skills , without ontological ( or representational ) separations between these domains ( Spivey , 2007 ; Barsalou , 2008 ; Frontiers in Psychology www . frontiersin . org January 2013 | Volume 3 | Article 612 | 1 Pezzulo et al . Computational grounded cognition Glenberg , 2010 ) . Historically the grounded perspective has mainly targeted psychological phenomena . However , it aligns well with current theories in neuroscience that emphasize a continuity between the neuronal circuits that solve essential problems of action speci - ﬁcation and selection in early organisms , and those that solve more elaborated problems in humans ( cf . Shadlen et al . , 2008 ; Cisek and Kalaska , 2010 ) . Furthermore , the debate on the embodied nature of brain and cognition has a substantial impact on many other disciplines , including philosophy , linguistics , the social sciences , and robotics ( Verschure et al . , 2003 ; Pfeifer and Bongard , 2006 ; Clark , 2008 ) . Despite its growing popularity , the full potential of this methodology has not yet been demonstrated ; and this is not only a matter of obtaining new empirical demonstrations of the importance of grounding for cognition . The framework is empirically well - established , but the theories are relatively underspeciﬁed . A real breakthrough might result from the real - ization of explicit computational models that implement grounding in sensory , motor and affective processes as intrinsic to cognition .

ComputationalGroundedCognition The fusion and cross - fertilization between grounded cognition theories , computational modeling , and cognitive robotics methods . The goal of Computational Grounded Cognition is developing process models of how grounded phenomena originate during ( human and animal ) development and learning and how they are expressed in on - line processing . WHAT IS GROUNDED COGNITION ABOUT ? A FIELD MAP Grounded and embodied theories of cognition have become popular by stressing “the role of the body in cognition” ( e . g . , body orientation in relation to spatial processing or metaphor - ical reasoning , cf . Lakoff and Johnson , 1999 ) . However , the scope of these theories is presently much wider and thus the literal meaning of the term “embodied cognition” is too narrow . As shown in Figure 1 , grounded cognition is the name of a methodological approach to the study of cognition , which describes it as “grounded in multiple ways , including simula - tions , situated action , and , on occasion , bod - ily states” ( Barsalou , 2008 , pp . 619 ) . Grounded cognition theories are bases for studying how knowledge and concepts are grounded in the modalities and bodily states , how cognitive pro - cesses such as language and thought are rooted in the body’s interactions with the physical and social environment , and how situated simula - tions and the re - enactment of perceptual , motor and affective processes can support abstract thought . Ultimately , the promise of grounded theo - ries of cognition is to explain behavioral and experimental patterns in all of the traditional provinces of cognition ( e . g . , attention , memory , reasoning , and language ) without recourse to a central module , showing instead that these pat - terns emerge from all of the systems in the brain , the body , and the environment ( see the arrows pointing to the “Classic Cognition” domain in Figure 1 ) . Below we provide ﬁve examples of grounded phenomena chosen for illustrative purposes . 1 . Barsalou and collaborators ( Niedenthal et al . , 2005 ; Wilson - Mendenhall et al . , 2011 ) have documented that the acquisition of concep - tual knowledge about emotions requires the embodiment of the corresponding bodily , affective , and emotional states . The same emotional states are re - enacted when emo - tion knowledge is used to perceive , recog - nize , and interpret the emotions of self and others . Niedenthal et al . ( 2005 ) discuss sev - eral other examples of social embodiment of attitudes , social perception , and emotion . ( see also Ferri et al . , 2010 ) . 2 . A signiﬁcant example of embodiment sig - natures in cognition is attention deploy - ment , which plays a central role in forming concepts and directing reasoning within a grounded cognition framework . For exam - ple , Grant and Spivey ( 2003 ) found that people who were about to solve a difﬁcult diagram - based insight problem ( Duncker’s Tumor - and - Lasers problem ) tended to pro - duce subtly different eye - movement patterns compared to people who were about to give up on the problem . Those particular eye movements were part and parcel of the cog - nitive insight process itself , revealing that these people were about to discover the solu - tion . In a second experiment , Grant and Spivey implicitly induced those eye move - ments in a new group of participants , and the number of people achieving insight doubled . Thus , the high - speed perception - action loop produced by eye movements ( where an eye movement to an object inﬂuences both cog - nition and the next eye movement to another object , and so on ) constitutes a sensorimo - tor ordering of micro - cognitive states from which high - level reasoning can emerge , such as abstract insight into a difﬁcult puzzle . 3 . Embodiment exerts its inﬂuence during development . Yu and Smith ( 2012 ) report that young learners solve the hard problem of learning object names by using an embodied Frontiers in Psychology www . frontiersin . org January 2013 | Volume 3 | Article 612 | 2 Pezzulo et al . Computational grounded cognition FIGURE 1 | Grounded cognition : a ﬁeld map . strategy . Essentially , their hand , head and eye movements help to stabilize attention on a selected target , thus reducing competition in the visual ﬁeld and ultimately supporting word learning . 4 . The importance of the linkage between visual and motor processes is well - demonstrated by the stimulus - response compatibility effect ( Tucker and Ellis , 2001 ; Ellis et al . , 2007 ) . These studies demonstrate that when we perform visual categorization tasks ( e . g . , identifying artifact vs . natural objects ) , the micro - affordances linked to the objects ( e . g . , power grasp for a large apple or precision grip for a small cherry ) affect visual catego - rization performance , even if they are irrel - evant for the task . This suggests that seeing an object automatically evokes motor pro - grams appropriate to deal with it . Glenberg and Kaschak ( 2002 ) have provided additional demonstrations of action - compatibility effects ( ACE ) , such as faster response times when the action used for reporting a choice is con - gruent with the context in which the action is typically used , or with the semantics and pragmatics of linguistic stimuli . This latter evidence suggests that even linguistic pro - cessing might be grounded in action ( see also Glenberg , 2010 ) . 5 . Finger counting ( see Figure 2 ) is used throughout the world to acquire concep - tual knowledge about numbers . Historically , several cultures chose number symbols that resembled hand and ﬁnger shapes . Recently , the inﬂuence of ﬁnger counting habits on adult number processing was documented by Fischer ( 2008 ) and Domahs et al . ( 2010 ) . Note that we do not consider these ( and other ) grounding phenomena as optional add - ons of an overall amodal cognition , but con - stitutive of it . For instance , we do not assume that affective states modulate an amodal cogni - tive categorization process , but that they actually constitute the categorization , and thus are nec - essary for it ( Niedenthal et al . , 2005 ) . This is a key difference between the grounded view and alternative theories that assign embodied phenomena a limited role in “true” cogni - tion ( e . g . , those that assume amodal process - ing plus some contextual modulation ) , or those that assume a one - directional leakage from Frontiers in Psychology www . frontiersin . org January 2013 | Volume 3 | Article 612 | 3 Pezzulo et al . Computational grounded cognition FIGURE 2 | Numerical cognition can be grounded in bodily actions . central amodal processing to the sensorimo - tor peripheries ( Mahon and Caramazza , 2008 ) . Further elaborations and distinctions , such as that between on - line and off - line embodiment , are discussed in Myachykov et al . ( 2013 , unpub - lished ) . GROUNDING , EMBODIMENT , AND SITUATEDNESS : A CONCEPTUAL CLARIFICATION Grounded theories of cognition are often deﬁned in contrast to traditional cognitive sci - ence ( e . g . , denying representation in terms of amodal symbols , and rejecting accounts of cog - nitive processing in terms of arbitrary symbolic manipulations ) , or reduced to a slogan ( e . g . , “the body plays a role in cognition” ) . The recent proliferation of grounded theories , which are often associated with different claims and per - spectives ( Wilson , 2002 ) , has lead to a confusing usage of terms such as “grounded , ” “embod - ied , ” and “situated . ” Like in Barsalou ( 2008 ) , we use the term “grounding” as a suitcase word to deﬁne the ﬁeld . Furthermore , as cognition can be grounded in multiple ways , it is often neces - sary to formulate more speciﬁc hypotheses , such as clarifying whether a cognitive process is inﬂu - enced by a bodily state , a situated simulation , or both . For this , we propose that the effects of grounding , embodiment , and situatedness can be conceptualized as a cascade and have additive effects on cognition and representation ( see Figure 3 ) . Below we give some examples of grounding , embodiment , and situatedness in the domain of numerical cognition . This domain is chosen because it has been considered as a domain par excellence for abstract and amodal concepts , a view we wish to challenge . FIGURE 3 | Grounding , embodiment and situatedness : a cascade of effects on cognition . Grounding Cognition has a physical foundation and is shaped by physical properties of the world , such as gravity , celestial light sources , and the laws of physics . Grounding of numerical cognition is reﬂected in the universal association of smaller numbers with lower space and larger numbers with upper space ( Ito and Hatta , 2004 ; Schwarz and Keus , 2004 ) , which reﬂects the physical necessity that aggregating more objects makes larger piles . Alternatively , grounding could be expressed through the perception of the cardi - nality of a set ( Stoianov and Zorzi , 2012 and references therein ) which natively supports fun - damental cognitive operations . Embodiment Embodied representations are shaped by physical constraints of an individual’s body . These sensory - motor experiences are structured according to physical principles that provide the grounding of cognition . Therefore , unusual bodies create unusual minds ( Casasanto , 2011 ; Keehner and Fischer , 2012 ) , and systematic use of one’s body also inﬂuences the cognitive representation of numbers . Consider the fact that small / large numbers are responded to faster with the left / right hand . This SNARC effect ( spatial - numerical association of response codes ) is weaker in people who start counting on the ﬁngers of their right hand ( Fischer , 2008 ; Lindemann et al . , 2011 ) , presumably because right - starters have initially learned to associate small numbers with their right side . Importantly , it becomes clear that indi - vidual differences ( physical and experiential ) modulate this component of the SNARC effect .

Computational grounded cognition Situatedness Situated cognition refers to the context - Cognitive Robotics The ﬁeld of robotics that takes inspiration from theories of human and animal cognition to endow robots with comparable cognitive abilities . Cognitive robotics ultimately aims at realizing intelligent and embodied systems ( robots ) that make decisions and take actions autonomously in realistic environments , includingsocial ( human - robot and robot - robot ) scenarios . dependence of cognitive processing , that is , to current constraints and task demands . Two examples illustrate how the speciﬁc situation further modulates the grounded and embodied representation of numbers ( see also Fischer et al . , 2009 , 2010 ) : ﬁrst , a given number is associated with left or right space , depending on the number range tested ( Dehaene et al . , 1993 ) . Second , turning one’s head to the left / right induces the production of smaller / larger random numbers ( Loetscher et al . , 2008 ) . TOWARD A COMPUTATIONAL GROUNDED COGNITION For grounded cognition theories to improve their explanatory scope , it is necessary to develop ( better ) process models of how grounded phenomena originate during development and learning and how they are expressed in on - line processing . Some examples of fruitful cross - fertilization between grounded cognition and computational modeling studies exist already ( see e . g . , Cangelosi and Riga , 2006 ; Spivey , 2007 ; Schöner , 2008 ; Hope et al . , 2010 ; Pezzulo and Calvi , 2011 ) , but the ﬁeld would greatly bene - ﬁt from an integrative effort : a Computational Grounded Cognition initiative . Given that computational modeling has been around for a long time , what is special about Computational Grounded Cognition ? Below we discuss this issue . First , we summarize the most important elements that grounded com - putational models should incorporate ( see also Pezzulo et al . , 2011 ) . Second , we emphasize the importance of adopting Cognitive Robotics as a research methodology . KEY ASSUMPTIONS OF GROUNDED COMPUTATIONAL MODELS Grounded computational modeling requires constructing models in which cognition is deeply interrelated with sensorimotor action and affect , and cognitive abilities emerge from the interactions between sub - processes rather than being implemented in isolated “cog - nitive modules . ” Thus , the cognitive algo - rithms for word reading , speech recogni - tion , object recognition , action understand - ing , and problem - solving should incorporate information from perceptual , motor , and affec - tive processes when producing their results , and this is seldom seen in current computa - tional models . This design method demands an integrative approach , which can be called “ interactionism , ” in which cognition stems Interactionism A theoretical framework in the cognitive and neural sciences that places emphasis on how a given cognitive process ( e . g . , language , memory , numerical processing ) emerges from the interaction between multiple subsystems rather than from the operation of an individual module devoted to that process . from “coordinated non - cognition” ( Barsalou et al . , 2007 ) . Modal vs . amodal representations According to grounded theories , cognition is supported by modal representations and asso - ciated mechanisms for their processing ( e . g . , situated simulations ) , rather than amodal repre - sentations , transductions , and abstract rule sys - tems . Recent computational models of sensory processing can be used to study the ground - ing of internal representations in sensorimotor modalities ; for example , generative models show that useful representations can self - organize through unsupervised learning ( Hinton , 2007 ) . However , modalities are usually not isolated but form integrated and multimodal assem - blies , plausibly in association areas or “conver - gence zones” ( Damasio , 1989 ; Simmons and Barsalou , 2003 ) . Furthermore , during learn - ing strong interdependences among sensory and motor representations are established that incorporate sensory regularities created by an agent’s actions , forming sensorimotor contin - gencies ( O’Regan and Noe , 2001 ) or emulators ( Grush , 2004 ) . Similarly , theories of active per - ception emphasize that sensory stimuli are not experienced passively but gathered actively , and action deployment structures the way people develop sensory representations . For example , Held and Hein ( 1963 ) showed that if cats expe - rience the world only passively , they develop suboptimal perceptual representations . An open research objective is incorporating these ideas in computational models that realize the simulta - neous grounding of representations in multiple modalities as well as across sensory , motor and affective processes . One computational method for integrating modalities is designing robot controllers com - posed of multiple , interlinked modal maps ( e . g . , Kohonen’s , 2001 self - organizing maps , or pop - ulation codes , Ma et al . , 2006 ; Morse et al . , 2010 ) . These might include motor maps , visual maps , and auditory maps , with the goal of investigating how they combine to support cog - nitive processing . This approach has recently been taken by Rucinski et al . ( 2011 ) when implementing the SNARC effect in a humanoid robot . Generative models can be used as well to explain multimodality and top - down inﬂu - ences ( e . g . , from motor or reward to sensory representations ) . Another open research question concerns the hierarchical structure of association areas and the interaction of bottom - up activation vs . top - down simulation processes ( Friston , Frontiers in Psychology www . frontiersin . org January 2013 | Volume 3 | Article 612 | 5 Pezzulo et al . Computational grounded cognition 2010 ) , which potentially permits conceptual knowledge to exert inﬂuence on sensorimotor processes . From sensorimotor experience to cognitive skills : abstraction and abstract thought on the top of a modal system Grounded computational models should not come pre - equipped with ( arbitrary ) representa - tions . Instead , they should acquire “grounded modal symbols” through development and sen - sorimotor interaction , with genetic constraints presumably also playing a role . Furthermore , grounded computational models should acquire advanced cognitive abilities and abstract thought on top of their modal systems , not in separate subsystems . In other words , not only should representations be grounded in the modalities , but also their processing should be fully embodied , such that there is no cen - tral processing independent of sensorimotor processes and / or affective experience . Figure 4 sketches an initial proposal for a “multi - modal processor” that can poten - tially implement cognitive and symbolic oper - ations in modal systems ( rather than with amodal symbols ) . First , grounded models are based on situated interaction of the robot with its environment , which can include both robots and humans . These multimodal sym - bols integrate perceptual , motor and valence information . Second , cognitive processing prin - cipally involves situated simulation , which is the re - enactment of grounded symbols ( Barsalou , 1999 ) . Cognition thus involves constraints that are similar to those in overt action because rel - evant episodic representations and associated bodily resources and sensorimotor strategies are activated . Situated simulations may also support cog - nitive processing of objects or events in their absence . This can range from delib - erate forms of imagery ( Kosslyn , 1980 ) to automatic , unconscious processing ( Jeannerod , 2001 , 2006 ) . Forms of action simulation and mental imagery have been linked to compre - hension , reasoning , prospection , object catego - rization , action recognition , and other com - plex cognitive tasks ( Glenberg , 1997 ; Jeannerod , 2006 ; Hassabis and Maguire , 2009 ; Moulton and Kosslyn , 2009 ; Schacter et al . , 2012 ) . These studies support simulation as a core process , which can both recreate experiences and productively recombine them , resulting in novel and prospective experiences , ultimately supporting off - line cognition without amodal representations . An important challenge is explaining how abstract concepts and symbolic capabilities can be constructed from grounded categorical rep - resentations , situated simulations and embod - ied processes . It has been suggested that abstract concepts could be based principally on inte - roceptive , meta - cognitive and affective states ( Barsalou , 2008 ) and that selective attention and categorical memory integration are essen - tial for creating a symbolic system ( Barsalou , 2003 ) . Grounded computational models can help better specifying and testing these initial proposals . Realistic linkage of cognitive processes with the body , the environment , and brain dynamics In grounded cognition theories , cognitive pro - cessing in even abstract domains depends on sensorimotor skills and bodily resources . This leads to the possibility that expressions like “tak - ing a perspective on a problem” or “putting FIGURE 4 | A grounded cognition perspective on how grounded ( modal ) symbols are ﬁrstly formed based on situated interactions with the external environment , and later re - enacted as situated simulations , which afford higher - level cognitive processing . Frontiers in Psychology www . frontiersin . org January 2013 | Volume 3 | Article 612 | 6 Pezzulo et al . Computational grounded cognition oneself into another’s shoes” or “grasping a con - cept” should be taken more literally than they normally are . This is due to at least two con - verging factors . First , cognitive abilities develop on top of the architecture for sensorimotor con - trol , and the gradual maturation of the latter constitutes a scaffold for the former . Second , cognitive abilities re - enact and re - use modal representations rather than amodal recoding , and typically reuse existing sensorimotor com - petences in increasingly more complex cognitive domains ( e . g . , visuomotor strategies for prob - lem solving , Grant and Spivey , 2003 ) rather than building novel modularized components . For these reasons , grounded cognitive processes have the same power , but also the same con - straints , as bodily actions , and to understand the former it is necessary to provide realistic models of the latter . Indeed , the grounded approach to model - ing a cognitive ability begins by considering the sensorimotor processes that could support it . For example , a robot could ﬁrst learn to spatially navigate , and then learn to reason in temporal and mathematical domains using its spatial representations and bodily processes as a scaffold . This potentially may produce behav - ior in line with the SNARC effect ( cf . Rucinski et al . , 2011 ) . This approach enables incorpo - rating increasingly more complex constraints as the tasks become more demanding . For exam - ple , spatial abilities can be reused to learn social interaction and joint action tasks . This approach can reveal how constraints from grounding , embodiment , and situatedness shape cognition in the brain . For example , studying language learning and usage in the context of realis - tic social interactions can help to explain why brain regions that are active when processing objects and actions are also active when nouns and verbs are comprehended ( Pulvermüller , 2005 ) . Note that although we have mainly empha - sized psychological processes , computational models beneﬁt also from the incorporation of anatomical and neurophysiological con - straints that help linking grounded theories to neuronal substrates . One example is the impor - tance of reentrant loops and efference copies in neural computational hierarchies ( Crapse and Sommer , 2008 ) , which suggests a possi - ble way that action streams inﬂuence perception and cognition . Recent EEG evidence has also shown that early sensory pathways are mod - ulated by the action associations of objects and the intentions of the viewer ( Goslin et al . , 2012 ) . COGNITIVE ROBOTICS AS A RESEARCH METHODOLOGY FOR COMPUTATIONAL GROUNDED COGNITION Potentially , many types of computational mod - els ( e . g . , connectionist , dynamical systems , and Bayesian ) and “approaches” ( see the recent dis - pute between “normative” and “emergentist” approaches , Grifﬁths et al . , 2010 ; McClelland et al . , 2010 ) are well - suited for modeling grounded phenomena . Shifting from a theoreti - cian’s to an engineer’s perspective , one argument is that the most compelling demonstration of any theory’s success is : when you build it , does it work ? A move from purely computational toward cognitive robotic models could drastically improve our ability to develop and test grounded theories of cognition . Cognitive robotics is a broad research area whose central aim is realizing complete robotic architectures that , on the one hand , include principles and constraints derived from animal and human cognition and , on the other hand , have realistic embodiment , sensors and effectors , and learn to act autonomously in complex , open - ended ( and social ) . Cognitive robotics enables simul - taneous consideration of multiple aspects of grounding , embodiment , and situatedness , showing how they constrain the development and expression of cognition . Thus , the beneﬁts of adopting a cognitive robotics methodology are multifaceted . 1 . Cognitive robotic models are an ideal choice to incorporate the entire cascade of effects of grounding , embodiment , and situatedness ( including individual and social scenarios ) . 2 . Cognitive robotics is suitable for experi - encing environments full of choices , with numerous sources of rewards and punish - ments ( e . g . , manipulation of objects , social interactions ) . In turn , this permits linking behavior and cognitive processing with real - istic motivational and emotional dynamics . 3 . Cognitive robotic models favor uniﬁed design approaches that combine multi - ple psychological processes ( e . g . , attention , memory , action control ) in the context of a speciﬁc task . This stands in opposition to ( and usefully complements ) the divide - and - conquer methodology of most empirical research , which , although useful , runs the risk of compartmentalizing cognitive phe - nomena . Cognitive robotics thus can be used to move beyond isolated models of single functions to focus on complete architectures that develop their skills over time . Frontiers in Psychology www . frontiersin . org January 2013 | Volume 3 | Article 612 | 7 Pezzulo et al . Computational grounded cognition 4 . Cognitive robotics incorporates nicely the idea that behavior and cognition are orga - nized around the achievement of goals and the deployment of actions . The centrality of action and its linkage with perception emerge if one considers that for a function - ing robot , action is also a way to change the environment in order to steer ensuing stim - uli and to learn actively . Researchers from many traditions have emphasized the impor - tance of learning from ( the consequences of ) one’s actions . The goal - centered perspective could help with linking all cognitive abili - ties under common computational and neu - ral processing principles . In this perspective , representation ability , memory ability , cat - egorization ability , and attention ability , all could be ultimately in the service of action and goal achievement , rather than having disconnected functions ( e . g . , vision as a re - coding of the external world ) . 5 . Cognitive robotic models can have realistic embodiment and can be used to investigate the reciprocal inﬂuences among the body , action and perception , such as , for instance , how action sculpts the body space ( Rizzolatti et al . , 1997 ) . Principled approaches to per - ceptual processing describe the task of the brain as that of extracting statistical regular - ities from the sensorium . Cognitive robotics recognizes that also embodiment and action are sources of statistical regularities that are incorporated through learning ( Verschure et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore , embodiment can alleviate brain processing in multiple ways , for example by providing solutions to control problems ( Pfeifer and Bongard , 2006 ) , con - straining choice to a space of possibilities that is body - scaled ( Gibson , 1979 ) , and imple - menting situated problem - solving strategies ( Kirsh and Maglio , 1994 ) . Note that to study most of these phenomena the mere posses - sion of a body is not sufﬁcient , but is nec - essary to develop realistic models of sensory processing , action systems , body schema and awareness ( Haggard et al . , 2002 ) . 6 . Cognitive robotic models are plausible plat - forms to explore the dynamics of change and adaptation at the evolutionary and developmental levels ( studied by “develop - mental” or “epigenetic robotics” ) . At the DevelopmentalRobotics The ﬁeld of robotics that takes inspiration from theories of human development to study the development of comparable cognitive abilities in robots . Developmental robotics ultimately aims at realizing robots that develop novel abilities by learning from exploration as well as with the help of teachers , much like children do . evolutionary level , this can help us to under - stand how advanced cognitive skills develop on top of an existing neural architecture that solves basic problems of survival and reproduction ( Pezzulo and Castelfranchi , 2007 , 2009 ) . At the developmental level , this can help us to understand how the progressive maturation at the level of sen - sorimotor coordination scaffolds the acqui - sition of cognitive and intellectual skills , and how the latter remain linked to the sensorimotor processes that provided scaf - folding for their development ( Rosenbaum et al . , 2001 ; Thelen and Smith , 1994 ; von Hofsten , 2004 ) ; see also ( Anderson , 2010 ) for a discussion of “reuse” of neural substrates across simpler and more complex abili - ties . Developmental robotics ( speciﬁcally aimed at modeling developmental phenom - ena , see Cangelosi and Schlesinger , 2013 ) offers new ways to investigate this topic in more detail . For example , it permits manip - ulating robot knowledge and skills so as to assess what are the necessary prereq - uisites for the development of a particu - lar cognitive ability . Furthermore , it permits studying the environmental conditions that facilitate or prevent normal cognitive devel - opment , and the social dynamics that scaf - fold language use and culture formation ( Steels , 2003 ) . CONCLUSIONS : CHALLENGES FOR A NEW SCIENTIFIC ENTERPRISE Grounded theories of cognition claim that the development and expression of cognition is grounded in sensorimotor processes , affective states , and bodily strategies ; furthermore , cog - nitive abilities have tight links with the envi - ronmental and social contexts in which they were acquired , rather than constituting isolated modules . A large body of work ( reviewed in Barsalou , 2008 ) strongly supports this view . Still , grounded cognition theories lack process models and computational realizations . We have proposed a “new alliance” of grounded cognition and computational mod - eling toward a novel scientiﬁc enterprise : Computational Grounded Cognition . This joint initiative requires that both computational modelers and empiricist adapt their research methodologies . Computational modelers should undergo a “grounded turn” : they should fully incorpo - rate the key tenets of grounded theories and increasingly adopt robotic platforms to bet - ter deal with issues of embodiment , situat - edness , and development . Modeling grounded cognition tasks poses a huge multidimensional problem , as they could potentially incorpo - rate multiple kinds of constraints ( psycho - logical , anatomical , physiological ) and link to realistic physical and social environments Frontiers in Psychology www . frontiersin . org January 2013 | Volume 3 | Article 612 | 8 Pezzulo et al . Computational grounded cognition ( e . g . , with human - robot interactions or multi - agent teams ) . This requires the elaboration of novel design methodologies that are multilevel and isolate sub - problems without losing the rel - evant directions . One possible starting point consists of designing functional - level architec - tures ﬁrst , which more easily integrate pro - cessing principles , and then developing models that are more detailed at the neuronal level ( see Verschure and Althaus , 2003 ) . But clearly , the advantages of this approach ( or the oppo - site one which starts from neurophysiologi - cally detailed models ) have to be evaluated in practice . One challenge for Computational Grounded Cognition is the realization of design principles that take multiple levels and con - straints into account and allows researchers to study many phenomena , but are also spe - ciﬁc enough to avoid losing contact with data obtained from animal or human experiments . Empiricists should better incorporate the “synthetic methodology” of computational modeling and cognitive robotics within their own research . To this aim , it is necessary that good ( off - the - shelf ) process models of grounded phenomena become available that experi - menters can easily incorporate in the design , operationalization and testing of their theo - ries and experiments . Success stories already exist in many ﬁelds of psychology and neuro - science . For example , a family of reinforcement learning algorithms ( e . g . , Temporal Difference Reinforcement Learning , Sutton , 1988 ) and statistical methods ( e . g . , drift diffusion mod - els , Ratcliff , 1978 ) are widely used to analyze neural data and to develop process models of ( perceptual and reward - based ) learning and decision - making . Similarly , the MOSAIC model provided a coherent framework for numerous experiments in computational motor control and social interaction ( Wolpert et al . , 2003 ) . Similar proposals are emerging in the ﬁeld of grounded cognition , especially in the dynamic systems family of models . From this perspec - tive , cognitive processing does not operate by using symbols , but rather by the dynamic inter - actions of multiple processes of perception and action , which become coupled through learning and interaction with the environment . Spivey’s ( 2007 ) proposal of continuous attractor dynamics constitutes a common computational foundation for numerous studies in attention , language processing , and reasoning , showing a continuous interaction between decision - making and motor execution . Computational models for the parallel speciﬁcation and selec - tion of multiple actions have been proposed in neuroscience that can explain the mechan - ics of decision - making and bridge the gap between simple and abstract choices ( Cisek , 2012 ; Shadlen et al . , 2008 ) . Schöner’s ( 2008 ) dynamic ﬁeld framework is another example of a widely adopted approach that has the potential to explain cognitive phenomena at many lev - els . Important insights might come from recent advancements in probabilistic approaches to neural processing , biological learning , and con - trol , as well ( Doya et al . , 2007 ; Friston , 2010 ; Shadmehr and Mussa - Ivaldi , 2012 ) . Still , there is clearly a place for new ideas and ambi - tious researchers who want to develop better process models of cognition that have ground - ing , embodiment , and situatedness at their core .
