The F - BAR { Fes / CIP4 [ Cdc42 ( cell division cycle 42 ) - interacting protein 4 ] homology and BAR ( Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ) } proteins have emerged as important co - ordinators of signalling pathways that regulate actin assembly and membrane dynamics . The presence of the F - BAR domain is the hallmark of this family of proteins and the CIP4 ( Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ) was one of the ﬁrst identiﬁed vertebrate F - BAR proteins . There are three human CIP4 paralogues , namely CIP4 , FBP17 ( formin - binding protein 17 ) and Toca - 1 ( transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly 1 ) . The CIP4 - like proteins have been implicated in Cdc42 - dependent actin reorganization and in regulation of membrane deformation events visible as tubulation of lipid bilayers . Results . We performed side - by - side analyses of the three CIP4 paralogues . We found that the three CIP4 - like proteins vary in their effectiveness to catalyse membrane tubulation and actin reorganization . Moreover , we show that the CIP4 - dependent membrane tubulation is enhanced in the presence of activated Cdc42 . Some F - BAR members have been shown to have a role in the endocytosis of the EGF ( epidermal growth factor ) receptor and this prompted us to study the involvement of the CIP4 - like proteins in signalling of the PDGFR β [ PDGF ( platelet - derived growth factor ) β - receptor ] . We found that knock - down of CIP4 - like proteins resulted in a prolonged formation of PDGF - induced dorsal rufﬂes , as well as an increased PDGF - dependent cell migration . This was most likely a consequence of a sustained PDGFR β activation caused by delayed internalization of the receptor in the cells treated with siRNA ( small interfering RNA ) speciﬁc for the CIP4 - like proteins . Conclusions . Our ﬁndings show that CIP4 - like proteins induced membrane tubulation downstream of Cdc42 and that they have important roles in PDGF - dependent actin reorganization and cell migration by regulating internalization and activity of the PDGFR β . Moreover , the results suggest an important role for the CIP4 - like proteins in the regulation of the activity of the PDGFR β . 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed ( email pontus . aspenstrom @ ki . se ) .

Introduction The importance of an active interplay between the actin cytoskeleton and the machinery that regulates membrane trafﬁcking events has received increas - ing attention during recent years . Vital biological processes , such as cell migration , endocytosis and exocytosis , require the concerted regulation of the cytoskeleton and the machinery responsible for mem - brane dynamics ( Smythe and Ayscough , 2006 ) . Mem - bers of the F - BAR { Fes / CIP4 [ Cdc42 ( cell divi - sion cycle 42 ) - interacting protein 4 ] homology and www . biolcell . org | Volume 102 ( 4 ) | Pages 215 – 230 215 M . Toguchi and others Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs } also known as PCH ( pombe Cdc15 homology ) family of proteins have been im - plicated in these processes ( Lippincott and Li , 2000 ; Aspenstr¨om et al . , 2006 ; Chitu and Stanley , 2007 ) . The F - BAR proteins are multi - domain adapter pro - teins and the founding member of this family , the ﬁs - sion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein Cdc15p , was originally identiﬁed in a screen for thermo - sensitive mutants in the cell division cycle of S . pombe ( Nurse et al . , 1976 ) . Cdc15p is involved in actin regulation and cdc15 mutant cells cannot form a nor - mal actomyosin ring at the site of cell separation ( Frankhauser et al . , 1995 ) . Membrane - targeting of the F - BAR proteins is conferred by the F - BAR do - main , which structurally and functionally resembles the canonical BAR domains found in proteins in the endocytic pathway ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . Sim - ilarly to the BAR domains , the F - BAR domains were shown to induce tubulation of lipid membranes in vitro and in vivo ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . This tubulation is considered to be a process that oc - curs during the initial phase of endocytosis as well as during membrane trafﬁcking events . The three - dimensional structure of the F - BAR domains stud - ied so far , show that the domains form crescent - shaped antiparallel dimers . The domain is composed of ﬁve α - helices : a short N - terminal α - helix , three extended α - helices followed by a short C - terminal α - helix , and a bundle formed by helices 2 , 3 and 4 constitutes the core element ( Henne et al . , 2007 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . The banana - shaped structure of the F - BAR domains gives rise to a concave surface with an excess of positively charged residues , which can bind to the negatively charged head groups on the lipid membranes . The diameter of the cross sec - tion of the tubes formed by F - BAR dimers vary in size from around 50 up to 150 nm ( Henne et al . , 2007 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . The mechanisms by which F - BAR domains induce membrane deforma - tion are still under debate , but according to a recent study , the membrane binding and bending abilit - ies of F - BAR domains constitute distinct proper - ties ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) . According to the model proposed in this study , the F - BAR domains do not necessarily bind curved membranes ; instead F - BAR domains can bind side - wise to ﬂat membranes . Oli - gomerization of the F - BAR domains result in a re - localization of the curved surface to face the mem - brane and drive membrane deformation ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) . The CIP4 - like proteins , which are the focus of the present study , comprise three members : CIP4 , FBP17 ( formin - binding protein 17 ) and Toca - 1 ( transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly 1 ) . These pro - teins have N - terminal F - BAR domains , central HR1 ( protein kinase C - related kinase homology region 1 ) domains and C - terminal SH3 domains . HR1 do - mains have been shown to bind Rho GTPases and the HR1 domains in CIP4 and Toca - 1 bind Cdc42 , while in FBP17 , the HR1 domain binds Rnd2 ( As - penstr¨om , 1997 ; Fujita et al . , 2002 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ) . The CIP4 - like proteins participate in regulation of actin dynamics by binding , with their SH3 domains , to the WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) – Arp2 / 3 complex ( actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ) and / or to DRFs ( diaphanous - related formins ) ( Tian et al . , 2000 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ; Aspenstr¨om et al . , 2006 ) . Thereby , they have a direct inﬂuence on the two major machineries for actin polymerization . The WASP – Arp2 / 3 complex mediates the formation of branched networks of actin ﬁlaments , whereas the DRFs me - diate the elongation of actin ﬁlaments ( Higgs , 2005 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . In the present study , we examined the potential involvement of the CIP4 - like proteins in signalling by the PDGFR β [ PDGF ( platelet - derived growth factor ) β - receptor ] . To this end , we employed siRNAs ( small interfering RNAs ) speciﬁc for the individual CIP4 - like proteins and we also expressed full - length and deletion mutants of the proteins in porcine endothelial cells and mouse ﬁbroblasts . We found that CIP4 - like proteins induced membrane tubula - tion and that they have important roles in PDGF - dependent actin reorganization and cell migration by regulating the internalization and activity of the PDGFR β . Results The CIP4 - like proteins localize to dynamic actin structures The tubulation of lipid membranes induced by some F - BAR proteins has been shown to be linked to en - docytosis ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . We performed side - by - side analyses of the effects on membrane tubu - lation and actin organization induced by the three 216 C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2010 Portland Press Ltd CIP4 - like proteins in PDGF signalling Research article members of the CIP4 - like F - BAR proteins . To this end , we transfected plasmids encoding FLAG - or Myc - tagged CIP4 , FBP17 or Toca - 1 into PAE ( por - cine aortic endothelial ) / PDGFR β cells and analysed the formation of membrane tubules . CIP4 localized in the cytoplasm and induced tubules in 49 % of the transfected cells , mostly seen as tubular patches ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . Notably , the tubular struc - tures often stained positive for F - actin ( Figure 1A , arrowheads ) . CIP4 expression was also accompanied by a reduction in the stress ﬁbre content , similar to what was previously observed in Swiss 3T3 cells ( Fig - ures 1A and 1B ) ( Aspenstr¨om , 1997 ) . Unlike CIP4 , exogenously expressed Myc - tagged Toca - 1 was uni - formly distributed in the cytoplasm and only mar - ginally induced tubules in transfected cells ( 11 % of the cells , Figures 1A and 1B ) . In contrast , FLAG - tagged FBP17 exposed a markedly different subcel - lular distribution and formed long tubular structures in the cytoplasm in 90 % of the transfected cells ( Fig - ure 1A ) . FBP17 has previously been shown to in - duce tubulation of liposomes in vitro as well as in vivo ( Kamioka et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , FBP17 - induced tubules also stained positive for F - actin , and FBP17 in - duced a signiﬁcant reduction of the stress ﬁbres ( Fig - ure 1B ) . The effects on tubulation were not restricted to PAE / PDGFR β cells ; ectopic expression of CIP4 - like proteins in MEFs ( mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ) also induced membrane tubulation and stress ﬁbre dissolution ( see Supplementary Figure S1 at http : / / www . biolcell . org / boc / 102 / boc1020215add . htm ) . CIP4 - dependent tubulation requires the F - BAR domain We next focused on CIP4 and tested which domain of CIP4 was responsible for tubulation and targeting of CIP4 to patches . We employed the transient trans - fection procedure as an assay to study the tubulating activity of CIP4 - like proteins in vivo . For this pur - pose , the deletion mutants depicted in Figure 2 ( A ) were transiently transfected into PAE / PDGFR β cells and the tubulation efﬁciency was evaluated by ﬂuor - escence microscopy . We found that a CIP4 mutant containing only the F - BAR domain was slightly more efﬁcient in producing tubules , compared with the full - length CIP4 ( 70 % versus 50 % ; Figures 2B and 2C ) . In contrast , a mutant CIP4 that lacked the FCH domain was unable to induce tubulation and did not co - localize with F - actin ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . In addi - tion , a mutant containing only the FCH domain was equally ineffective in inducing tubules ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . These observations indicate that an intact F - BAR domain is required for the tubulation and targeting of CIP4 to tubules . Activated Cdc42 regulates the formation and morphology of the CIP4 - induced tubules We have previously reported that the simultan - eous expression of a GTPase - deﬁcient Cdc42 mutant , Cdc42 / Q61L , together with CIP4 induced the form - ation of dorsal microvilli as well as the translocation of CIP4 to the cell edges ( Aspenstr¨om , 1997 ) . Con - sidering the current knowledge regarding the role of F - BAR domains in inducing liposome tubulation , this phenomenon needed to be reinvestigated . The previous study was not done by confocal analysis and the ‘dorsal microvilli’ could in fact reside in - side the cytoplasm close to the plasma membrane . To this end , we co - expressed Cdc42 / Q61L and CIP4 in PAE / PDGFR β cells . This triggered CIP4 to in - duce tubule structures at a signiﬁcantly increased frequency and length compared with the cells trans - fected with CIP4 alone ( compare Figures 1A and 3B ) . Fifty per cent of the cells expressing CIP4 alone had developed tubules , which were short and patch - like ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . In contrast , when CIP4 was ex - pressed together with Cdc42 / Q61L , tubulation was visible in almost 90 % of the cells and half of them had signiﬁcantly longer tubules than those seen in cells expressing CIP4 alone ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Indeed , confocal analysis showed that the tubules were restric - ted to the cytoplasm ( results not shown ) . The tubules positive for CIP4 were often positive for Cdc42 / Q61L ( Figure 3A ) . Interestingly , we noticed an alteration in the morphology of the tubules when a Cdc42 mutant ( Cdc42 / F28L ) was co - transfected with CIP4 . Cdc42 / F28L cycles between GDP - and GTP - bound conformations independently of guanine - nucleotide - exchange factors ( Lin et al . , 1997 ) , and we observed that this Cdc42 mutant decreased the ratio of long tubules and CIP4 - positive tubules in favour of shorter patch - like tubules ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . In addition , there was an increased localization of CIP4 to the cell edges ( Figure 3A , arrowheads in the second panel ) . This suggests that the activated GTP - bound status of Cdc42 is an important determinant for the formation of CIP4 - dependent membrane tubules . www . biolcell . org | Volume 102 ( 4 ) | Pages 215 – 230 217 M .

We also tested whether Cdc42 / Q61L could trigger the formation of Toca - 1 - induced tubules ; however , very few tubules were observed under these condi - tions although Toca - 1 is a Cdc42 - binding protein ( Figures 3A and 3B , see Supplementary Figure S2 at http : / / www . biolcell . org / boc / 102 / boc1020215add . htm ) . Moreover , a reduction of the FBP17 - induced tubules was noticed when FBP17 was co - expressed www . biolcell . org | Volume 102 ( 4 ) | Pages 215 – 230 219 M . Toguchi and others Figure 3 Cdc42 induces CIP4 - dependent tubulation ( A ) Subcellular localization of FLAG - tagged CIP4 , Toca - 1 or FBP17 co - transfected with Myc - tagged Cdc42 / Q61L or Cdc42 / F28L was determined with a mouse monoclonal anti - FLAG antibody followed by a TRITC - conjugated anti - mouse antibody . Myc - tagged Cdc42 was visualized with a rabbit anti - Myc antibody followed by an Alexa Fluor ® 488 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody . Filamentous actin was visualized by Alexa Fluor ® 350 - conjugated phalloidin . The arrowheads show the co - localization of CIP4 / Q61L and CIP4 in the upper panel and the localization of CIP4 to the cell periphery in response to co - expression of Cdc42 / F28L . Scale bar , 20 μ m . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of the ability of CIP4 - like proteins to induce tubulation was performed by microscopy analysis . Tubules with a size of < 3 μ m were counted as short and tubules with a size > 3 μ m were scored as long tubules . In most cases , the long tubules spanned the entire perinuclear area . The values represent the analysis of at least 100 cells derived from three independent experiments . with Cdc42 / Q61L ( compare Figures 1B and 3B ) . One possible explanation for this effect could be that activated Cdc42 induces a scission of the rather long FBP17 - induced tubules . It should be men - tioned that there is a difference in the afﬁnity for Rho GTPases between the different CIP4 - like proteins . CIP4 and Toca - 1 bind all three mem - bers of the Cdc42 subfamily ; however , the inter - action between TC10 and Toca - 1 is rather weak . Interestingly , FBP17 binds TCL ( TC10 - like ) but not at all to Cdc42 or TC10 ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . 220 C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2010 Portland Press Ltd CIP4 - like proteins in PDGF signalling Research article The CIP4 - binding GTPases TC10 and TCL are less efﬁcient in triggering the formation of CIP4 - dependent tubules We next tested whether additional Rho GTPases can induce the formation of tubules when co - expressed with CIP4 . We found that a constitutively active mutant of TC10 ( TC10 / Q75L ) had no major effect on the formation of tubules ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . TCL / Q79L induced a robust relocalization of CIP4 into edge rufﬂes but tubules were rarely seen ( Fig - ures 4A and 4B ) . Rac1 / Q61L , which does not bind CIP4 at all , did not induce a relocalization of CIP4 ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . This suggests that the length of the tubules is regulated by Cdc42 and not by the other Cdc42 - like GTPases . Moreover , TCL seems to have a unique role in targeting CIP4 to the cell peri - phery . PDGF signalling leads to Cdc42 activation in PAE / PDGFR β cells What is the physiological relevance of the Cdc42 - induced CIP4 - dependent tubulation ? Receptor tyr - osine kinases , such as the PDGFR β , have been found to activate Rho GTPases and FBP17 has pre - viously been shown to co - localize with the EGF ( epidermal growth factor ) receptor ( R¨onnstrand and Heldin , 2001 ; Kamioka et al . , 2004 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . We hypothesized that activation of endogen - ous Cdc42 by PDGF stimulation would also result in the formation of CIP4 - dependent tubules . We fo - cused on Cdc42 , since the other member of the Cdc42 subfamily , TCL , is not expressed in PAE / PEGFR β cells or in MEFs , and TC10 is expressed at modest levels in these cells ( see Supplementary Figure S3 at http : / / www . biolcell . org / boc / 102 / boc1020215add . htm ) . We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that PDGF - BB stimula - tion in PAE / PDGFR β cells induced the activation of Cdc42 by employing a GST ( glutathione transferase ) pull - down assay ( Figure 5A ) ( Edlund et al . , 2002 ) . PDGF - BB stimulation also activated Cdc42 in MEFs , which express endogenous levels of the PDGFR β , but the timing of the activation differed from the PAE / PDGFR β cells ( Figure 5B ) . We next transfec - ted PAE / PDGFR β cells with CIP4 and stimulated the cells with PDGF - BB for 10 min . The stimulation was associated with a relocalization of CIP4 into tu - bules ( Figure 5C ) . Noticeably , CIP4 was commonly relocated to dorsal rufﬂes in the cells ( Figure 5C ) . These circular or dorsal rufﬂes represent a clathrin - independent pathway for internalization of cell sur - face receptors and the patches seen in the rufﬂes rep - resent endocytosed vesicles ( Orth et al . , 2006 ) . Im - portantly , PDGF stimulation induced a localization of endogenous CIP4 to the cell periphery and to dorsal rufﬂes in MEFs , suggesting a role for CIP4 in the or - ganization of dorsal rufﬂes ( Figure 5D ) . Cells treated with CIP4 - speciﬁc siRNA show a prolonged response in the formation of dorsal rufﬂes We next wanted to test if knock - down of CIP4 with siRNA had any role in the PDGF - BB - induced actin reorganization and in the formation of dorsal rufﬂes . To this end , CIP4 - speciﬁc siRNA was transfected into normal MEFs . We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that a CIP4 - speciﬁc siRNA could knock down the expression of CIP4 in this cell line ( see Supplementary Figure S4 at http : / / www . biolcell . org / boc / 102 / boc1020215add . htm ) . In this experiment we focused on CIP4 , since it was shown to localize to dorsal rufﬂes . We next trans - fected MEFs with control siRNA or CIP4 - speciﬁc siRNA and stimulated the cells with PDGF - BB for 10 and 30 min . This treatment commonly in - duces the formation of edge rufﬂes and dorsal rufﬂes and the balance between the two responses differs between cell types ( R¨onnstrand and Heldin , 2001 ) . In this particular ﬁbroblast cell line , formation of dorsal rufﬂes represents the predominant PDGF - BB - dependent morphogenetic response . Cells transfected with the control siRNA formed dorsal rufﬂes after 10 min in response to PDGF - BB stimulation . After 30 min , the formation of dorsal rufﬂes was about to cease and the cells had started to recover stress ﬁbres ( Figure 6A , quantiﬁcation in Figure 6C ) . In contrast , dorsal rufﬂe formation was slightly delayed in the cells transfected with the CIP4 - speciﬁc siRNA but , importantly , these cells exhibited signiﬁcantly more dorsal rufﬂes after 30 min compared with the control cells ( Figure 6B , quantiﬁcation in Figure 6C ) . This suggests that the PDGF - BB - dependent formation of dorsal rufﬂes is sustained in cells with a reduced ex - pression of CIP4 . A similar response was seen in NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ; also in this case knock - down of CIP4 resulted in a sustained membrane rufﬂing seen after 30 min of PDGF - BB stimulation ( Figure 6D ) . Im - portantly , transient transfection of Myc - tagged hu - man CIP4 returned the membrane rufﬂing activity to more or less normal levels ( Figure 6D ) . www . biolcell . org | Volume 102 ( 4 ) | Pages 215 – 230 221 M .

( C ) Quantiﬁcations of dorsal rufﬂe formation . Randomly picked areas were scored for the ability of the cells to form dorsal rufﬂes . Over 200 cells were scored for each condition . The values represent the means for three experiments . Statistical analysis was performed using a Student’s t test . ( D ) NIH 3T3 cells were analysed in a similar manner to the MEFs in ( C ) . The NIH 3T3 cells were also transfected with Myc - tagged human CIP4 in order to suppress the phenotype caused by CIP4 siRNA treatment . Human CIP4 was used since it is inert to the siRNA directed against the murine CIP4 . Statistical analysis was performed using a Student’s t test . Knock - down of CIP4 expression results in a sustained PDGFR β activation and decreased receptor internalization We next examined the mechanism underlying the sustained dorsal rufﬂing activity in cells with de - creased CIP4 expression . To this end , we transfected MEFs with siRNA for CIP4 or Toca - 1 and the ef - ﬁciency of the siRNA reagents was tested ( Supple - mentary Figure S4 ) . Interestingly , the tyrosine phos - phorylation of the PDGFR β was sustained in cells with ablated CIP4 or Toca - 1 expression ( Figure 7A ) . We hypothesized that the sustained receptor ac - tivation was caused by a delay in the internalization of PDGFR β in cells lacking CIP4 - like proteins . To this end , we studied the timing of the receptor ac - tivation by cross - linking the cell surface receptors at various time points after PDGF - BB stimulation . The PDGFR β was effectively internalized in the con - trol cells ; after 60 min of stimulation only a minor portion of the receptor remained bound to the sur - face . In contrast , treatment of cells with siRNA for CIP4 and Toca - 1 resulted in a marked delay in the receptor internalization and a signiﬁcant amount of the receptor remained at the plasma membrane after 60 min ( Figure 7B ) . The effect seems to be speciﬁc for the PDGFR β , since the internalization of the trans - ferrin receptor was not visibly affected by the siRNAs ( Figure 7B ) . We concluded that the sustained activ - ation of PDGFR β in the absence of CIP4 - like pro - teins was caused by a delayed internalization of the activated receptor , which implies a role for these pro - teins in the normal process of internalization of the PDGFR β . CIP4 - like proteins are involved in cell migration Since knock - down of the CIP4 - like proteins results in a prolonged PDGFR β activation and a sustained formation of dorsal rufﬂes , we next analysed if this was associated with an increased PDGF - BB - induced cell migration in cells lacking CIP4 - like proteins . To this end , MEFs were transfected with siRNA speciﬁc for CIP4 or Toca - 1 . Conﬂuent cells were wounded with a plastic tip and the efﬁciency in wound clos - ure in the presence of PDGF - BB was determined as described in the Experimental section . Cells with reduced levels of CIP4 or Toca - 1 had signiﬁcantly increased wound closure ability ( Figures 8A and 8B ) . The effect was not dependent on an increased prolif - eration rate , since cells from different experimental conditions had similar proliferation rate as determ - ined by a BrdU ( bromodeoxyuridine ) incorporation assay ( results not shown ) . These results show that knock - down of CIP4 - like proteins causes delayed re - ceptor internalization , which is transformed into an increased receptor activation and an augmented ruff - ling activity and increased cell migration . Discussion Cell migration is a complex process and requires the co - ordinated reorganization of adhesion proteins , cytoskeletal elements and the reconstruction of the plasma membrane . There is a growing list of observa - tions pointing to direct links between the machinery for cytoskeletal regulation and the factors regulating membrane dynamics and architecture ( Janmey and Lindberg , 2004 ) . During cell migration , all these as - pects need to be tightly co - ordinated in time and space in order for the cell to adapt the morphogenesis and migration to a wealth of external and internal signals . In addition , the robust alterations in the cell surface area during cell migration necessitate a neatly regulated co - operation between endocytosis , exocyt - osis and the cytoskeleton . www . biolcell . org | Volume 102 ( 4 ) | Pages 215 – 230 225 M . Toguchi and others Figure 7 Knock - down of CIP4 - like proteins results in sustained PDGFR β activation and delayed receptor internalization ( A ) MEFs were transfected with siRNA or siRNA for CIP4 ( CIP4 / 2 ) or Toca - 1 ( Toca - 1 / 2 ) , and stimulated with 50 ng / ml of PDGF for the time intervals depicted in the Figure . The cells were lysed and subjected to SDS / PAGE followed by Western blotting with an antibody raised against phosphotyrosine residues ( PY99 ) to detect activated PDGFR β . The ﬁlters were stripped and blotted with an antibody for PDGFR β ( CT β ) . ( B ) MEFs were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA for CIP4 ( CIP4 / 2 ) or Toca - 1 ( Toca - 1 / 2 ) , and stimulated with 50 ng / ml of PDGF for the time intervals depicted in the Figure . In order to detect the cell surface proteins still exposed at the surface of the cells , the cells were cross - linked with sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin and were lysed and the biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin – agarose as described in the Experimental section . The precipitated receptors were subjected to SDS / PAGE followed by Western blotting with an antibody raised against PDGFR β ( CT β ) or the transferrin receptor ( TrfR ) . The identiﬁcation of BAR domains has provided an entirely new set of tools for our understanding of the regulation of cytoskeletal – membrane interac - tions . The BAR domains not only function as lipid anchors , but they also induce alteration in the shape of the lipid bilayers , which is an important factor during the formation of lipid vesicles , such as endo - cytic or exocytic vesicles ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . It is clear that BAR domain - containing proteins have important roles in the regulation of the structure and function of lipid bilayers . The F - BAR domain pro - teins used in the present study , CIP4 , FBP17 and Toca - 1 , are good examples of cytoskeletal regulators of this kind . Although the CIP4 - like proteins have been reported to induce tubulation before ( Kamioka et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) , we demonstrate in the present study that there is a difference in their respective abilities to induce tu - bules . FBP17 is by far the most efﬁcient member of this family , whereas Toca - 1 is almost unable to in - duce tubules in our assays . The tubulating activity of CIP4 is somewhere in between FBP17 and Toca - 1 . Importantly , the CIP4 - triggered tubules are depend - ent on the activated , GTP - loaded , status of Cdc42 . Moreover , the tubules also contain ﬁlamentous actin , suggesting collaboration between the CIP4 - like pro - teins and the actin polymerization machinery . The F - BAR protein PACSIN2 ( protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2 ) is an integral com - ponent of the F - actin tail induced by expression of PIP5 kinase I α ( phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5 - kinase I α ) ( Plomann et al . , 2009 ) . In the present case , F - actin seems to coincide with the exogenously expressed CIP4 - like proteins along the length of the tubules and did not appear to be accumulated towards the rear ends of the tubules . Instead , the smaller tu - bules , in particular the patches observed in CIP4 - expressing cells , resembled the F - actin patches seen in cells during endocytosis of the Heliobacter pylori VacA toxin ( Gauthier et al . , 2007 ) . This internaliza - tion by a clathrin - independent pathway involves the adaptor protein CD2AP ( CD2 - associated protein ) as well as a number of actin - binding proteins . There is a clear connection between the activ - ity of tyrosine kinase receptors and the activation of Rho GTPases ( R¨onnstrand and Heldin , 2001 ; 226 C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2010 Portland Press Ltd CIP4 - like proteins in PDGF signalling Research article Figure 8 Knock - down of the CIP4 family of proteins results in an increased PDGF - BB - dependent cell migration ( A ) Cells were cultured in six - well plates and transfected with control siRNA or siRNA for CIP4 ( CIP4 / 2 ) or Toca - 1 ( Toca - 1 / 2 ) . The cells were serum - starved overnight and thereafter wounded with a plastic tip and stimulated with 50 ng / ml PDGF - BB . For each condition , three representative ﬁelds were photographed at 0 and 48 h . ( B ) The cells were counted and normalized by area and calculated as percentage of non - stimulated control cells . Each experimental condition was repeated at least three times . Statistical analysis was performed using a Student’s t test . www . biolcell . org | Volume 102 ( 4 ) | Pages 215 – 230 227 M . Toguchi and others Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2002 ) . In the present study , we noticed a robust activation of Cdc42 by stimulation of the PDGFR β . CIP4 was originally cloned as a Cdc42 - binding protein and it was no - ticed that Cdc42 induced a relocalization of CIP4 when they were co - transfected in Swiss 3T3 ﬁbro - blasts ( Aspenstr¨om , 1997 ) . In the present study , we demonstrate a dependency of the activity of Cdc42 on the formation of CIP4 - induced tubulation , which has not been observed before . We also no - ticed a difference in the CIP4 - dependent tubulation between the different members of the Cdc42 family ( Cdc42 , TC10 and TCL ) , although all three mem - bers possess the ability to bind CIP4 ( Aspenstr¨om et al . , 2004 ) . The GTPase - deﬁcient mutant of Cdc42 , Cdc42 / Q61L , induced the formation of very long tu - bules , but the fast cycling mutant , Cdc42 / F28L , in - stead induced short tubules , suggesting that an active GDP / GTP cycling of Cdc42 is required for scission of the CIP4 - induced tubules into smaller vesicles . PDGF - BB is a potent regulator of chemotaxis and cell migration ( R¨onnstrand and Heldin , 2001 ) . An - other tyrosine kinase receptor , the EGF receptor has been shown to be internalized via ‘dorsal waves’ , which are presumably just another way to describe dorsal , or circular , rufﬂes ( R¨onnstrand and Heldin , 2001 ; Orth et al . , 2006 ) . These waves were shown to represent a clathrin - independent pathway for EGF receptor internalization . Since we found CIP4 to loc - alize to dorsal rufﬂes in PDGF - BB - stimulated cells , we hypothesized that the CIP4 - like proteins might be involved in the internalization of the PDGFR β . Knock - down of the individual CIP4 family mem - bers resulted in a clear delay in the internalization of the PDGFR β . The prolonged surface exposure of the receptor , furthermore , was associated with an in - crease in the kinase activity of the receptor , which was transmitted into a higher migratory ability of cells in which the CIP4 - like proteins were ablated with siRNA techniques . An involvement of CIP4 in cell migration was suggested by the observation that overexpression of CIP4 decreases the ﬁbroblast migration in wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays ( Dombrosky - Ferlan et al . , 2003 ) . Our results show the reciprocal effect : knock - down of the CIP4 - like proteins resulted in an increased PDGF - induced cell migration , and it also demonstrated a more direct involvement of the CIP4 - like proteins in cell migra - tion . Experimental Reagents , antibodies and DNA work The full - length human CIP4 , FBP17 and bovine Toca - 1 , as well as deletion mutants of CIP4 , were subcloned into the pRK5 FLAG or pRK5Myc vector . Myc epitope - tagged Cdc42 , TC10 , TCL and Rac1 and the pRK5 vector have been described previ - ously ( Aspenstr¨om et al . , 2004 ) . cDNA encoding human Toca - 1 was a gift from Marc Kirschner ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , U . S . A ) . DNA sequencing employing the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyser conﬁrmed the ﬁdelity of all DNA constructs . The following antibodies were used : rabbit anti - PDGFR β ( a gift from Johan Lennartsson , LICR , Uppsala , Sweden ) , rab - bit anti - Toca - 1 ( a gift from Marc Kirschner , Harvard ) , Mouse anti - Myc ( 9E10 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - Myc , mouse anti - phosphotyrosine ( PY99 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , mouse anti - FLAG ( M2 ; Sigma ) , mouse anti - CIP4 ( BD ) , mouse anti - transferrin receptor ( Zymed ) , FITC - conjugated anti - mouse , TRITC ( tetramethylrhodamine β - isothiocyanate ) - conjugated anti - rabbit ( Dako ) , TRITC - conjugated anti - mouse ( Jackson Im - munoresearch Laboratories ) , Alexa Fluor ® 488 - conjugated anti - rabbit ( Molecular Probes ) , Alexa Fluor ® 488 - conjugated and Alexa Fluor ® 350 - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) and TRITC - conjugated phalloidin ( Sigma ) . Cell cultivation and transfection Normal MEFs were cultured in DMEM ( Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS ( fetal bovine serum ) and penicillin / streptomycin . PAE cells stably transfected with the human PDGFR β , PAE / PDGFR β cells , were cultured in Ham’s F12 medium , supplemented with 10 % FBS and peni - cillin / streptomycin . All cells were cultured at 37 ◦ C in an at - mosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Knock - down of the expression of the CIP4 - like proteins was triggered by transfection of MEFs with double - stranded CIP4 , FBP17 and Toca - 1 - speciﬁc siRNA or a control siRNA ( synthesized by Ambion ) employing the Silent - Fect transfection reagent ( Bio - Rad ) . MEFs were seeded on to six - well plates and stimulated with PDGF - BB for the time intervals described in Figure 7 . The cells were lysed , washed with ice - cold PBS and lysed on ice in Triton buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 % glycerol , 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 1 % aprotinin and 0 . 5 mM Na 3 VO 4 ) . The cell lysates were subjected to SDS / PAGE and transferred on to nitrocellulose ﬁlters ( Hybond - C Extra ; GE Healthcare ) . Western blots were performed with antibod - ies as speciﬁed in the Figure legends followed by horseradish peroxidase - conjugated anti - mouse or anti - rabbit secondary an - tibodies ( GE Healthcare ) . The Western blots were detected by the Luminol Western Blotting reagent ( Santa Cruz Biotechno - logy ) and ﬁlms or a CCD ( charge - coupled - device ) camera ( Fuji ) . Biotinylation of cell surface proteins Cells were serum - starved overnight and stimulated with 50 ng / ml PDGF - BB for different periods of time at 37 ◦ C . Thereafter , cells were washed twice with ice - cold PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) and incubated for 1 h on ice with 0 . 2 mg / ml sulfo - NHS ( N - hydroxysuccinimido ) - SS - biotin ( Pierce ) in PBS . To inactivate unbound sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin , cells were treated for 5 min with 50 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) . Cells were lysed , and biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin – agarose ( Sigma ) for 1 h at 4 ◦ C . The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and 228 C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2010 Portland Press Ltd CIP4 - like proteins in PDGF signalling Research article boiled with SDS sample buffer . Eluted proteins were analysed by SDS / PAGE and Western blotting . Immunocytochemistry PAE / PDGFR β cells or MEFs were seeded on coverslips and transfected by Lipofectamine TM ( Invitrogen ) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer . Fixation and cell staining procedures essentially followed the scheme described previously ( Aspenstr¨om et al . , 2004 ) . Cells were photographed by a Hama - matsu ORCA CCD digital camera employing the QED Imaging System software using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope . Confocal analysis and live cell imaging was performed with a Zeiss Ax - iovert 200M microscope equipped with LSM 510 lasers . The cellular effects induced by ectopic expression were determined by microscopy analysis . At least 100 cells were scored for each experimental condition . The entire procedure was repeated three times in order to allow statistic analysis of the observed differ - ences in cell morphology . The statistic analysis was performed using the Student’s t test . Wound - healing assay MEFs cells cultured in six - well plates were transfected with the siRNA speciﬁc for CIP4 , FBP17 , Toca - 1 as well as a scrambled control siRNA . The cells were serum - starved overnight and wounded with a plastic pipette tip . Three parallel wounds were made per well . Wounded cells were washed twice with serum - free medium and stimulated with a medium containing 50 ng / ml PDGF - BB or 10 % FBS . For each condition , three rep - resentative ﬁelds were photographed at 0 and 48 h and the num - ber of cells within a deﬁned area were counted and calculated as a percentage of non - stimulated control cells . Each experimental condition was repeated at least three times . Statistical analysis was performed using a Student’s t test . Protein production and Cdc42 activation assay GST - linked WASP – CRIB domain ( Cdc42 / Rac - interacting binding domain ) was expressed in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed on glutathione – Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) . The formation of activated Cdc42 was analysed by the GST pull - down assay em - ploying the Cdc42 - binding domain of WASP , which speciﬁcally binds the GTP - loaded Cdc42 , essentially as previously described ( Edlund et al . , 2002 ) .

C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2010 Portland Press Ltd CIP4 - like proteins in PDGF signalling Figure S2 Interaction between CIP4 - like proteins and the Cdc42 subfamily of Rho GTPases The GBDs ( GTPase - binding domains ) of CIP4 , Toca - 1 and FBP17 were subcloned into the GAL4AD ( GAL4 activation do - main - containing ) vectors pACT or pACTII . The GAL4AD vectors were thereafter transformed into Y190 yeast cells expressing GAL4DB - TCL / Q79L , - TC10 / Q75L , - Cdc42 / Q61L or - Rac1 / Q61L , after which the cells were spread on SC ( synthetic complete ) medium lacking histidine , leucine and tryptophan residues and supplemented with 25 mM 3AT plates ( 3 - amino - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole ) . The transformants were then patched on to new 3AT plates ( A ) . Under these conditions , cells grow only in those cases where an interaction between the two fusion proteins restores a functional GAL4 protein and thereby induces transcription of the reporter genes , i . e . when the CIP4 - like proteins interacted with the Cdc42 - family GTPases . The transformants were also spread on SC medium lacking tryptophan and leucine ( SC - Trp - Leu ) to show that the yeast cells harbour both the GAL4AD and GAL4DB plasmids ( B ) . LacZ expression was assayed by a membrane - transfer assay and the ﬁlters were scored according to the speed of development of the blue colour ( + + + = rapid , + + = intermediate , + = slow , – = no blue colour ) ( C ) , using the method described by Aspenstr ¨om and Olsson ( 1995 ) . CIP4 and Toca - 1 bind TCL , TC10 and Cdc42 , whereas FBP17 only binds TCL . None of the CIP4 - like proteins bind Rac1 . www . biolcell . org | Volume 102 ( 4 ) | Pages 215 – 230 M .
