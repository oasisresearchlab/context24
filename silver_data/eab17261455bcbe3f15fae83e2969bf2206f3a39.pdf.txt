Recently , we have reported the expression and puriﬁcation of a mGluR from Drosophila melanogaster ( DmGluRA ) , a homologue of mammalian group II mGluRs . We have shown that ligand binding to reconsti - tuted DmGluRA requires the presence of ergosterol in the lipo - somes [ Eroglu , C . , Cronet , P . , Panneels , V . , Beauﬁls , P . & Sinning , I . ( 2002 ) EMBO Rep . 3 , 491 – 496 ] . Here we demonstrate that the receptorexistsindifferentafﬁnitystatesforglutamate , depending on the membrane composition . The receptor is in a high - afﬁnity state when associated with sterol - rich lipid microdomains ( rafts ) , and in a low - afﬁnity state out of rafts . Enrichment of the mem - branes with cholesterol shifts the receptor into the high - afﬁnity state , and induces its association with rafts . The receptor was crosslinked to photocholesterol . Our data suggest that sterol - rich lipid rafts act as positive allosteric regulators of DmGluRA . cholesterol (cid:1) metabotropic glutamate receptor (cid:1) nano - electrospray ionization tandem MS (cid:1) regulation of G protein - coupled receptors M etabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluRs ) are implicated in the regulation of many physiological and pathological processes in the CNS , including synaptic plasticity , learning and memory , motor coordination , pain transmission , and neurode - generation ( reviewed in refs 1 and 2 ) . Glutamate also functions as a neurotransmitter in the invertebrate CNS ( 3 ) , where it performs both excitatory and inhibitory actions ( 4 , 5 ) . The first Drosophila mGluR cloned , ( DmGluRA ) , shares the structural features characteristic for mammalian mGluRs ( 6 ) . Recently , we have reported the expression of DmGluRA in insect cells by recombinant baculovirus infection ( 7 ) , and in transgenic Dro - sophila melanogaster ( 8 ) , where the receptor is directed to the photoreceptor cells in the fruit fly eye , and is colocalized with rhodopsin in specialized membrane stacks , called rhabdomeres . Unlike many other G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , which possess a ligand - binding pocket in their heptahelical transmembrane domain ( 7TMD ) , mGluRs have a very large extracellular domain responsible for ligand binding ( 1 ) . The glutamate - binding domains of mGluRs have been expressed as soluble secreted receptors ( 9 – 11 ) . The crystal structure of the glutamate - binding domain of mGluR1 shows the presence of two globular domains separated by a hinge region ( 12 ) . The receptor exists in two different conformations , open ( resting ) and closed ( active ) , in the ligand - free form . Ligand ( glutamate ) binding stabilizes the closed ( active ) conformation rather than inducing it ( 12 , 13 ) . It is still not known for the full - length receptor how the ligand - binding domain ( LBD ) is functionally coupled to the 7TMD . Recently , a model for the crosstalk between these two domains has been presented ( 14 ) . This model postulates the existence of modulators that act on the 7TMD , which in turn influences ligand binding . Interestingly , we have previously ( 8 ) shown for reconstituted DmGluRA , that ligand binding depends on the presence of ergosterol in the liposomes . This finding suggests that a sterol – 7TMD interaction is involved in the regulation of ligand binding . Sterols are known to affect the function of various membrane proteins ( reviewed in ref . 15 ) , including GPCRs ( 16 , 17 ) . Sterols might mediate their action on membrane proteins , either indi - rectly by modulating the biophysical properties of the lipid bilayer , or by a direct interaction with the receptor acting as a cofactor ( 15 , 17 ) . Sterols are known to promote phase separation in membranes , thus playing an important role in the formation of lipid microdomains , which are also known as lipid rafts ( reviewed in refs . 18 and 19 ) . Detergent - resistant sterol - sphingolipid - enriched membranes ( DRMs ) , which can be iso - lated as a light ( floating ) fraction by using density gradients after detergent extraction at low temperatures , are derived from these lipid rafts ( 18 , 20 ) . Partitioning in and out of lipid rafts is thought to be involved in the sorting and regulation of membrane proteins ( 21 ) . In addition , lipid rafts are implicated in the establishment of polarity in certain cell types ( 18 , 22 ) , including neurons ( 23 ) . In this article , we show that sterols and rafts are involved in the regulation of DmGluRA , a key molecule for synaptic transmission . Materials and Methods Preparation of Membrane Fractions . Enriched plasma membrane fractions were prepared from transgenic Drosophila melano - gaster heads expressing DmGluRA in the photoreceptor cells ( DrDGR membranes ) , and insect cells ( Sf9 ) infected by a recombinant baculovirus expressing DmGluRA ( Sf9DGR mem - branes ) ( 8 ) . Crude lysate from transgenic Drosophila heads or postnuclear supernatant from insect cells were mixed 1 : 2 with OptiPrep ( Nycomed , Oslo ) resulting in 40 % solution ; the 30 % and 5 % OptiPrep solutions were laid on top . Plasma membrane enriched fraction formed a dense band at 30 – 5 % interface after 3 h of centrifugation at 100 , 000 (cid:1) g . Immunodetection of DmGluRA . DmGluRA was detected by a polyclonal antibody against a peptide in the extracellular domain of the receptor ( described in ref . 8 ) . Horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Sigma ) were used for detec - tion and the blots were developed by an enhanced chemilumi - nescence kit ( Amersham Pharmacia ) . Chemiluminescence was detected on BioMax MR1 films ( Kodak ) . This paper was submitted directly ( Track II ) to the PNAS ofﬁce .

DmGluRA expressed in Sf9 suspen - sion cells was purified by an immunoaffinity column as described in refs . 7 and 8 . Lipids dioleoyl - phosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) , dipalmitoyl - phosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) , and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids . Reconstitution was per - formed as described in ref . 8 . Glutamate Binding Assay . Homologous competitive binding ex - periments were performed on Sf9DGR and DrDGR mem - branes , as described ( 7 , 8 ) , in the presence of varying concen - trations of cold L - glutamate ( 10 (cid:2) 3 to 10 (cid:2) 8 M ) to determine the affinity of the receptor to glutamate . Membranes ( 20 – 40 (cid:2) g ) were incubated with 1 . 5 (cid:2) M tritiated glutamate ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) in 20 mM Tris , ( pH 7 . 4 ) buffer containing 0 . 2 % BSA for 2 h at 25°C . The binding mixtures were filtered through nitrocellulose membrane filters ( pore size 0 . 45 (cid:2) m , 25 - mm diameter ; Sigma ) , and the filters were washed four times with 2 ml of 50 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 4 ) 250 mM NaCl (cid:2) 0 . 1 % BSA . The radioactivity on the filters was counted . Reconstituted receptor ( 1 (cid:2) g ) was tested for binding in the same way , but with different washing stringencies . The total binding and IC 50 values were calculated by a GraphPad ( San Diego ) program , after entering the binding data ( dpm ) versus the logarithm of concentration of cold L - glutamate . The y axis was then converted to percent total binding to simplify comparison . Enrichment of Membrane Sterol Content . Methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin ( M (cid:1) CD ; Sigma ) – cholesterol complexes were formed as described in ref . 24 . Isolated plasma membrane fraction was treated with different concentrations of M (cid:1) CD – cholesterol complexes as de - scribed in ref . 16 . After treatment , membranes corresponding to 2 (cid:2) g of membrane protein were analyzed with a cholesterol oxidase assay kit ( Molecular Probes ) to check sterol incorporation , follow - ing the manufacturer’s protocol . The maximum cholesterol incor - poration ( (cid:3) 8 - fold of the original sterol content ) was reached when membranes were treated with 240 (cid:2) M of the complex . Isolation of Light - Density DRMs . The protocol was adapted from ref . 25 . Membrane protein ( 800 (cid:2) g ) was solubilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 ( TX - 100 , Serva , Germany ) in , and the extraction mixture was mixed 1 : 2 with OptiPrep ; the 30 % and 0 % OptiPrep solutions were laid on the top ( 1 . 2 and 0 . 2 ml , respectively ) . After 2 h of spinning at 55 , 000 rpm ( Beckman TLS55 rotor ) at 4°C , 350 - (cid:2) l fractions were taken from top to bottom . Ten - microliter samples from each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting . Crosslinking Cholesterol to DmGluRA . Photoactivatable analogue of cholesterol , photocholesterol , radioactively labeled with tritium , and in complex with M (cid:1) CD ( 26 ) , was a kind gift from C . Thiele ( Max Planck Institute of Cell Biology and Genetics , Dresden , Germany ) . Isolated plasma membranes from fruit fly heads ( 1 mg of total membrane protein ) or insect cells ( 3 mg of total membrane protein ) were incubated with M (cid:1) CD – [ 3 H ] photocholesterol com - plex ( 0 . 3 mCi , 2 mg ; 1 Ci (cid:4) 37 GBq ) . The photocholesterol was crosslinked by irradiation by using the filtered ( (cid:3) (cid:5) 310 nm ) beam ofahigh - pressuremercurylamp . One - tenthofthemembraneswere analyzed as total membrane protein , and the remainder was immunoprecipitated ( pulled down ) by using 50 (cid:2) l of 7G11 - Sepharose ( described in ref . 8 ) . The total membrane protein fractions and the pull - down fractions were analyzed by SDS (cid:2) 7 . 5 % PAGE . The labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography on x - ray films ( Hyperfilm , Amersham Pharmacia ) . Lipid Analysis . Membrane pellets were extracted , according to the method of Bligh and Dyer ( 27 ) . After solvent evaporation , samples were resuspended in methanol , and were further pro - cessed for nano - electrospray ionization tandem MS ( nano - ESI - MS (cid:2) MS ) as described ( 28 ) . Cholesterol and ergosterol analysis of the sulfated sterols was performed as described ( 29 ) .

Results DmGluRA Has Different Affinities to Glutamate , Depending on the Membrane Environment . Previously , we have described the over - expression of DmGluRA in Drosophila photoreceptor cells and in Sf9 cells ( 7 , 8 ) . We have purified and reconstituted Dm - GluRA , and showed that the ligand binding depends on the presence of sterols in the liposomes ( 8 ) . To try to understand how sterols affect the activity of DmGluRA , we decided to further characterize the receptor . To achieve this end , we determined the affinity of the receptor to glutamate . Compet - itive binding assays were performed on both DrDGR mem - branes and Sf9DGR membranes . Interestingly , DmGluRA expressed in Sf9DGR membranes had (cid:5) 10 - fold higher affinity to glutamate than did the same receptor expressed in the fruit fly eye in DrDGR membranes , ( IC 50 (cid:4) 4 . 17 versus 54 . 5 (cid:2) M ; Fig . 1 ) . Because our previous study pointed out the importance of the lipid environment in ligand binding to the receptor ( 8 ) , we tested whether the cause of this dramatic difference in affinity was due to differences in the lipid environment . To make this determination , we analyzed the lipid composition of the membranes from both sources by nano - ESI - MS (cid:2) MS ( 30 ) . The fatty acyl chains of phos - pholipids in DrDGR membranes were shorter and less saturated , whereas in Sf9DGR membranes , phospholipids contained longer and more saturated acyl chains ( Table 1 ) . The main sterol species from both membranes were different as shown ( 31 – 32 ) . DrDGR membranes contain ergosterol , whereas Sf9DGR membranes con - Fig . 1 . DmGluRAshavedifferentafﬁnitytoglutamatewhenexpressedinSf9 cells or in fruit ﬂy heads . Competitive glutamate binding assays on Sf9DGR membranes ( A ) and DrDGR membranes ( B ) show that the receptor expressed in Sf9DGR membranes has 10 - fold higher afﬁnity to glutamate than the receptor expressed in the fruit ﬂy eye ( IC 50 : 4 . 17 versus 54 . 5 (cid:2) M ) . Curves represent the mean of independent experiments ( n (cid:4) 4 ) .

The amounts of sterol per mg of membrane protein were similar in both membranes ( see Table 3 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Sf9DGR membranes contain sphingomyelin and other sphin - golipids ( Table 2 and Fig . 7 C ) . In contrast , DrDGR membranes lack sphingomyelin , but contain other sphingolipid species [ glucosylceramides ( GlcCer ) , 14 : 1 ; 18 : 0 and 14 : 1 ; 20 : 0 and phosphoethanolamine Cer ( PECer ) , 14 : 1 ; 20 : 0 ) ] , including hydroxylated GlcCer species : GlcCer 20 : 0 - OH ( 73 . 6 % ) and GlcCer 22 : 0 - OH ( 26 . 5 % ; Table 2 and Fig . 7 C ) . The High - Affinity State of DmGluRA Correlates with Its Association with DRMs . Sterols associate with the long and saturated fatty acyl chains of sphingolipids and phospholipids , and form tightly packed lipid microdomains , which are also known as lipid rafts . Lipid rafts are thought to be the source of DRMs . Taking into account the results of our lipid analysis , we asked whether the differences in affinity we observed could be the result of a biophysical state of the membrane , rather than the sterol content per se . To confirm our findings , we tested whether DmGluRA associates with DRMs . Sf9DGR and DrDGR membranes were treated with TX - 100 , and subjected to density gradient centrif - ugation ( see Materials and Methods ) . Western Blot analysis of fractions from the density gradient showed that DmGluRA was mostly DRM - associated ( floating to the light density fraction ) in Sf9DGR membranes ( Fig . 2 A ) , whereas it was mostly not DRM - associated ( in the bottom fractions ) in DrDGR mem - branes ( Fig . 2 B ) . These results , together with the affinity data from DrDGR and Sf9DGR membranes , suggest that raft association is involved in the modulation of the affinity of the receptor to glutamate . To further test this conclusion , we decided to increase the sterol content of DrDGR membranes . This end can be achieved by treatment of membranes with preformed water - soluble in - clusion complexes of M (cid:1) CD with cholesterol ( 33 ) . Ergosterol could not be used because it failed to form stable complexes with M (cid:1) CD . Increasing concentrations of M (cid:1) CD – cholesterol com - plex treatment resulted in increase of membrane 3 - hydroxyl sterol content up to 8 - fold in DrDGR membranes ( see Materials and Methods ) . Competitive glutamate binding assays were per - formed on these membranes after treatment . The analysis of the binding curve showed an (cid:3) 50 - fold increase in affinity to gluta - mate ( IC 50 (cid:4) 1 . 2 (cid:2) M ; Fig . 3 A ) . Interestingly , the total binding was also increased ( up to 2 . 5 - fold ) after sterol treatment . This increase in the total binding could be due to either the activation of previously inactive receptor present in the membranes by the addition of sterols , or to the increase in affinity as the binding assay is done with [ 3 H ] glutamate concentrations ( 1 . 5 (cid:2) M ) close to the IC 50 values . Next , DRM association of DmGluRA was examined in these membranes . On treatment with M (cid:1) CD - cholesterol , a significant portion of the receptor was incorpo - rated into DRMs ( Fig . 3 B ) . Together , these results suggest a role of raft association in the regulation of the affinity of the receptor to glutamate . DmGluRA Directly Interacts with Cholesterol .

( B ) InDrDGRmembranes , the receptor is mostly soluble ( in the bottom fractions , lanes 4 – 6 ) , indicating that it is not associated with DRMs . DmGluRA is detected by a polyclonal anti - DmGluRA antibody as described in ref . 8 . DmGluRA ( both in DrDGR or Sf9DGR membranes ) runs as an (cid:3) 100 - kDa monomer ( only when a reducing agent is present ) , and as an (cid:3) 200 - kDa SDS (cid:2) PAGE - resistant dimer . The mono - mer and dimer observed in SDS (cid:2) PAGE gels do not directly represent the oligomerization state of the receptor in the membranes . Eroglu et al .

Next , we asked whether DmGluRA directly interacts with sterols . To confirm this possibility , we used a photoacti - vatable analogue of cholesterol , known as photocholesterol , that has previously been used for labeling proteins with strong affinity to cholesterol ( 26 ) . DrDGR and Sf9DGR membranes were treated with M (cid:1) CD – [ 3 H ] photocholesterol complex , and is crosslinked by light activation ( see Materials and Methods ) . After labeling , total membrane proteins from these membranes were analyzed by SDS (cid:2) PAGE , and the labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography ( Fig . 4 A , lanes 1 – 3 ) . A strong band corre - sponding to the monomer size of the receptor was visualized after SDS (cid:2) PAGE in DrDGR membranes labeled with [ 3 H ] photocholesterol . A protein band of identical apparent molecular mass was also present in the fraction pulled down by a DmGluRA - specific monoclonal antibody ( 7G11 ) conjugated to Sepharose ( described in ref . 8 ) from these membranes ( Fig . 4 A , lane 4 ) , demonstrating that this band corresponds to DmGluRA . In Sf9 membranes , labeling of DmGluRA in Sf9DGR membranes was harder to distinguish from the back - ground ( Fig . 4 A , lanes 2 and 3 ) . However , the labeled receptor was detected in the pull - down fraction from Sf9DGR mem - branes ( Fig . 4 A , lane 5 ) , whereas no such band was present in the pull - down fraction from uninfected Sf9 cell membranes ( Fig . 4 A , lane 6 ) , thus demonstrating that the band that was seen having the correct apparent molecular mass belongs to DmGluRA . Interestingly , Western blot analysis of the same fractions ( Fig . 4 B ) showed that on labeling with photocholesterol , the receptor ran mainly as a monomer in SDS (cid:2) PAGE , and that there was a slight difference in migration between the receptor from DrDGR and Sf9DGR membranes . The pattern of DmGluRA recognition in Western blot analysis matches exactly with the autoradiography signals , thus confirming that the suspected band in autoradiography represents DmGluRA . DmGluRA is , to our knowledge , the first GPCR known to crosslink to cho - lesterol . This result suggests a direct interaction between the receptor and cholesterol . Partition of DmGluRA Into Lipid Rafts Modulates Its Binding Affinity . We have shown that sterols are required for the activity of Dm - GluRA , and that the high - affinity state of the receptor correlates with its association with lipid rafts . To distinguish whether the effect of sterols on the binding properties of DmGluRA depends only on the sterol concentration in the membrane or in the ability of sterols toinducetheformationoflipidrafts , wehavereconstitutedpurified DmGluRA into liposomes of two different compositions . Both types of liposomes had the same cholesterol concentration ( 40 % molar ) . The first type ( non - raft ; NR ) had 60 % unsaturated DOPC . The second type ( raft - like ; R ) contained 30 % saturated DPPC , as well as 30 % DOPC . The absence of saturated acyl chains in NR liposomes impairs formation of sterol - rich lipid microdomains . The saturated acyl chains of DPPC form a complex with cholesterol , thus promoting the formation of lipid rafts ( 18 , 34 , 35 ) . DmGluRA was reconstituted into NR and R liposomes with similar efficiency ( data not shown ) . Glutamate binding experiments were performed on these proteoliposomes ( see Materials and Methods ) . Because the amount of purified reconstituted receptor was limiting , we could not perform competitive binding assays as before . Instead , we measured the specific glutamate binding under low - and high - stringency conditions . Specific binding of glutamate was detected for both types of liposomes when the assay was performed with low stringency ( two washes ; Fig . 5 ) . The specific binding to DmGluRA reconstituted in R liposomes was 1 . 3 - fold higher than that of the receptor reconstituted in NR liposomes ( Fig . 5 ) . Interestingly , the specificbindingin NR liposomeswasdramaticallyreducedwhenthe stringency of the binding assay was increased by adding a third washing step . The third wash did not diminish the specific binding in R liposomes ( Fig . 5 , (cid:3) 10 - fold more specific binding in R liposomes compared with NR liposomes ) . This result suggests that the receptor in NR liposomes had lower affinity than the receptor in R liposomes , because the radioactive ligand could be displaced more easily from the receptor in NR liposomes . If the affinity would dependonlyonthemembranesterolconcentration , thereshouldbe no difference . Therefore , we conclude that the affinity of the receptor is not regulated by the sterol content alone , but rather by the partitioning of the receptor into lipid rafts . Fig . 3 .

Discussion Affinity of DmGluRA to Glutamate Is Regulated by DRM Association . We have previously shown ( 8 ) that glutamate binding to the purified DmGluRA strictly depends on the presence of ergos - terol . In this article , we show that the receptor has different affinity states , depending on the lipid environment , and we link the high - affinity state of DmGluRA to its association with sterol - rich membrane microdomains . We show that the high - affinity state of DmGluRA is induced by its association with lipid rafts . In addition , we show a direct interaction of cholesterol with DmGluRA by crosslinking . This interaction is most likely the major driving force for its DRM association . The oxytocin receptor is the only other GPCR for which it is known that ligand binding also depends on the presence of sterols ( 36 – 38 ) . This receptor belongs to the rhodopsin - like GPCR family , which possesses a ligand - binding pocket in its transmembrane domain . Two distinct affinity states of the receptor have been reported , and the high - affinity state is facilitated by increasing the cholesterol content ( 16 , 33 , 37 , 39 ) . However , the oxytocin receptor does not associate with DRMs ( 38 ) , and no direct interaction with sterols has been reported . Therefore , sterols might modulate the function of GPCRs in different ways . Our results indicate that sterols are required for ligand binding of DmGluRA ; however , the affinity for the ligand is modulated , not by the sterol content itself , but rather , by the ability of sterols to induce raft formation ( Fig . 5 ) . DRM Association of DmGluRA . Raft formation depends on the relative ratios of sterols , sphingolipids , and the degree of fatty acyl saturation ( 18 ) . Lipid analysis of Sf9DGR and DrDGR membranes showed significant differences in composition . Whereas Sf9DGR membranes contain sphingomyelin and saturated phos - pholipid species , DrDGR membranes lack sphingomyelin , and are enriched in glycerophospholipids with short and unsaturated acyl chains ( Table 1 , Table 3 , and Fig . 7 B and C ) . Consequently , DmGluRA was associated with DRMs in Sf9DGR , but not in DrDGR membranes ( Fig . 2 ) . Even though the sterol species are different in these two membranes , biophysical studies on lipid bilayers have shown that ergosterol and cholesterol affect the lipid bilayer properties in a similar fashion ( 18 , 35 ) , and ergos - terol has been shown to have even higher propensity to form rafts ( 35 ) . However , the shorter and more unsaturated fatty acyl chains in DrDGR membranes ( Table 1 ) would reduce the driving force of ergosterol to induce phase separation . In addition , lack of sphingomyelin might affect the extent of raft formation . However , certain ceramide species that are enriched in fruit fly head DRMs might partially replace sphingomyelin . The fact that DmGluRA expressed in DrDGR membranes is not associated with DRMs cannot be explained simply by the lack of DRMs in these membranes , as lipid analysis showed their presence ( Table 3 and Fig . 7 B and C ) . DrDGR membranes are not only derived from photoreceptor cells , but they are also derived from other cell types , such as nerve cells and the brain . In fact , rhab - domeres from fruit fly photoreceptor cells where DmGluRA is expressed ( 8 ) must be optimized for rhodopsin function , which is facilitated by the presence of unsaturated phospholipids , and is impaired by higher concentrations of cholesterol ( 40 , 41 ) . Studies on rod disk membranes ( mammalian rhabdomeres ) showed that they are poor in cholesterol and sphingolipids , and contain high amounts of polyunsaturated phospholipids ( 42 ) , and therefore do not support raft formation ( 17 ) . However phase separation can be induced by cholesterol enrichment of these membranes by using M (cid:1) CD – cholesterol complexes ( 17 ) . Our data are in line with these observations . We could induce the association of DmGluRA with DRMs in DrDGR membranes by adding cholesterol ( Fig . 3 B ) . In addition , the higher crosslinking efficiency of photocholesterol to DmGluRAinthesemembranessuggeststhatrhabdomeres , likerod disk membranes , contain a low level of sterols ( Fig . 4 A ) . However , in insect cell membranes , the crosslinking efficiency is lower as DmGluRA is in rafts , and therefore , photocholesterol must com - pete with endogenous sterols . Positive Allosteric Modulation of DmGluRA by Raft Association . Ac - cording to the current model of ligand binding to mGluRs ( 12 – 14 , 43 ) , the LBD oscillates between closed ( active ) and open ( resting ) conformations , and the binding of glutamate stabilizes the closed conformation . Similarly , the 7TMD also oscillates between differ - ent states ( active and resting ) , which are proposed to depend on the conformationoftheLBD . Thereverseshouldalsoapply , suggesting that an allosteric interaction exists between these two domains ( 14 ) . Therefore , the ligand - binding affinity can be altered by modulating Fig . 6 . Model for the regulation of ligand binding to DmGluRA by sterols . The receptor oscillates between an active and a resting state . Ligand binding shifts the equilibrium to the active state by stabilizing the LBD ( 12 , 14 ) . Our data suggest that sterol - rich lipid microdomains act as positive allosteric modulators , which alter the equilibrium between the active and resting state of the LBD by interacting with the 7TMD .

Intheabsenceofsterols , thereceptor is trapped in the resting state ( no binding ) ( 8 ) . Fig . 5 .

Excess glutamate ( 1 mM ) was added to measure nonspeciﬁc binding . The amount of liposomes remained equal in both cases throughout the assay . Speciﬁc binding was calculated by subtracting nonspeciﬁc binding from total binding . Average data plus SEM given are from experiments performed in triplicate . Eroglu et al .

We show that the ligand - binding properties of DmGluRA critically depend on sterols and lipid rafts . We suggest that both modulate ligand binding by acting on the 7TMD . In the absence of sterols , the receptor is trapped in the resting state ( no binding of glutamate ) , and therefore is inactive . The association of thereceptorwithsterol - richor - poordomainsalterstheequilibrium betweentheactiveandrestingstates ( Fig . 6 ) . Fortheraft - associated receptor , the active form is favored , and out of rafts the resting form is favored . Therefore , the affinity of the receptor to glutamate is high when in rafts , and is low when out of rafts . In conclusion , we propose that the association with sterol - rich lipid microdomains acts as a positive allosteric regulator of DmGluRA . Physiological Role of Raft Association of mGluRs . DmGluRA is homologous to group II mammalian mGluRs ( 6 , 44 ) . Group II mGluRs ( 2 (cid:2) 3 presynaptic ) , like DmGluRA , are associated with rafts in a sterol - dependent manner ( see Fig . 8 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . In addition , different affinity states of mGluR2 have been reported when expressed in different cell types ( 1 ) , which is analogous to our observations on DmGluRA . This finding implies that ligand binding to group II mGluRs might be regulated by sterols in a similar way . A recent study ( 45 ) suggests that mGluR1 (cid:4) ( group I , post - synaptic ) is not in rafts , whereas evidence is provided on the raft association of metabotropic GABA receptors ( GABAB ) , which arelocalizedpresynapticallysimilartogroupIImGluRs . Therefore , it is possible that raft association ( in a cholesterol - dependent manner ) is a characteristic of presynaptic metabotropic neurotrans - mitter receptors , and is involved in their sorting . Indeed , there is substantial evidence that rafts play a role in axonal polarization of nerve cells ( 46 , 47 ) . In addition , lipid rafts have been recently shown to facilitate the long - range axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors by inducing dimerization of Unc104 motor protein ( 48 ) . Raft association of DmGluRA must be a dynamic process to have a regulatory function . One of the possibilities of regulation would be the modification of the membrane composition at the presynaptic region . Even though there is very limited data on the dynamics of lipid composition at the synapse , there is evidence that lipids are playing important roles in the formation and regulation of endocytosis and exocytosis at these sites ( 49 ) . In addition , cholesterol is an important constituent of the synaptic vesicles ( 26 ) . Interestingly , cholesterol has been identified as a factor re - leased by glial cells that increases synapse number and efficacy ( 50 – 52 ) . This result suggests cholesterol - dependent mechanisms in the regulation of synaptic transmission , and plasticity in mammalian CNS ( 53 ) . mGluRs are primarily involved in these processes . Therefore , by regulating the cholesterol level of presynaptic membranes , glial cells might modulate the ligand - binding characteristics of presynaptic mGluRs ( group II ) , and facilitate synaptic transmission and plasticity .
