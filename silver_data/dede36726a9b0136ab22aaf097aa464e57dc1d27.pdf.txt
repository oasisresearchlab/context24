RES EAR CH Open Access Serine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for maximal host cell invasion by Campylobacter jejuni Derrick R Samuelson and Michael E Konkel * Abstract Background : Campylobacter jejuni causes acute disease characterized by severe diarrhea containing blood and leukocytes , fever , and abdominal cramping . Disease caused by C . jejuni is dependent on numerous bacterial and host factors . C . jejuni invasion of the intestinal epithelial cells is seen in both clinical samples and animal models indicating that host cell invasion is , in part , necessary for disease . C . jejuni utilizes a flagellar Type III Secretion System ( T3SS ) to deliver the Campylobacter invasion antigens ( Cia ) to host cells . The Cia proteins modulate host cell signaling leading to actin cytoskeleton rearrangement necessary for C . jejuni host cell invasion , and are required for the development of disease . Results : This study was based on the hypothesis that the C . jejuni CiaD effector protein mediates Erk 1 / 2 dependent cytoskeleton rearrangement . We showed that CiaD was required for the maximal phosphorylation of Erk 1 / 2 by performing an immunoblot with a p - Erk 1 / 2 specific antibody and that Erk 1 / 2 participates in C . jejuni invasion of host cells by performing the gentamicin protection assay in the presence and absence of the PD98059 ( a potent inhibitor of Erk 1 / 2 activation ) . CiaD was also found to be required for the maximal phosphorylation of cortactin S405 and S418 , as judged by immunoblot analysis . The response of human INT 407 epithelial cells to infection with C . jejuni was evaluated by confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to determine the extent of membrane ruffling . This analysis revealed that CiaD , Erk 1 / 2 , and cortactin participate in C . jejuni - induced membrane ruffling . Finally , cortactin and N - WASP were found to be involved in C . jejuni invasion of host cells using siRNA to N - WASP , and siRNA to cortactin , coupled with the gentamicin protection assay . Conclusion : We conclude that CiaD is involved in the activation of Erk 1 / 2 and that activated Erk 1 / 2 facilitates C . jejuni invasion by phosphorylation of cortactin on serine 405 and 418 . This is the first time that cortactin and N - WASP have been shown to be involved in C . jejuni invasion of host cells . These data also provide a mechanistic basis for the requirement of Erk 1 / 2 in C . jejuni - mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement . Keywords : Bacterial pathogenesis , Effector protein , Invasion , Erk 1 / 2 , N - WASP Lay abstract Campylobacter jejuni uses the flagellum as a Type III Se - cretion System ( T3SS ) . A subset of proteins are exported from the flagellum and delivered to the cytosol of host cells where they modify host cell signaling events to pro - mote bacterial invasion . Here we report that C . jejuni , which is the leading bacterial cause of food - borne dis - ease worldwide , usurps the host cell signaling proteins Erk 1 / 2 and cortactin . We show that the C . jejuni CiaD protein is required for the invasion of host cells and for the activation of Erk 1 / 2 ( a host cell kinase ) and cortac - tin ( a cellular scaffolding protein ) . The characterization of a virulence protein and the identification of a novel host cell signaling pathway exploited by C . jejuni pro - vides a significant advancement in the understanding of C . jejuni pathogenesis . Background Cortactin is an actin - binding protein that plays an integral role in the regulation and dynamics of the actin cytoskel - eton . Cortactin has emerged as a key cellular protein that microbes readily subvert during the establishment of in - fection [ 1 ] . To date , cortactin has been demonstrated to * Correspondence : konkel @ vetmed . wsu . edu School of Molecular Biosciences , Washington State University , College of Veterinary Medicine , Life Sciences Bldg .

While several pathogens , including Shigella , Neisseria , Rickettsia , Chlamydia , Staphylococcus , Listeria , Helicobacter , Escherichia , and Coxiella , require Src - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin for host cell invasion , the mechanism of cortactin activation has only been partially elucidated or is , in most instances , not known [ 1 - 8 ] . The role of various actin cytoskeleton regula - tors , including Erk 1 / 2 and cortactin , in C . jejuni invasion has not been elucidated . Campylobacter jejuni is a Gram - negative bacterial pathogen that causes acute disease characterized by se - vere diarrhea . C . jejuni causes ~ 1 . 4 to 2 . 3 million cases of gastroenteritis in the United States each year [ 9 ] . Guillain – Barré syndrome ( GBS ) , an autoimmune disease affecting the peripheral nervous system , can be a possible sequelae associated with certain strains of C . jejuni [ 10 ] . Motility , adherence , invasion , intracellular survival , and toxin pro - duction have all been shown to contribute to the severity of C . jejuni - mediated disease , illustrating the fact that dis - ease is a multifactorial process [ 11 - 16 ] . Maximal cell invasion requires the Campylobacter in - vasion antigens ( Cia ) [ 14 ] . The Cia proteins are exported from the bacterium ’ s flagellar Type III Secretion System ( T3SS ) and are delivered to the target host cell , where they presumably modify host cell regulatory proteins to promote C . jejuni - host cell entry and intracellular survival . Co - culture of C . jejuni with either host cells or host - like conditions results in increased expression of the genes en - coding the Cia proteins [ 17 , 18 ] . To date , four Cia proteins have been identified , designated CiaB , CiaC , CiaD , and CiaI [ 11 , 16 , 19 , 20 ] . The importance of the Cia proteins in campylobacteriosis has been demonstrated using in vivo studies with a ciaB mutant , which is deficient in the secre - tion of all of the Cia proteins [ 15 ] . Piglets inoculated with a C . jejuni wild - type strain develop severe diarrhea within 24 hours of infection and exhibited major histological ab - normalities , such as villus blunting and production of exu - dates in the lumen . In contrast , piglets inoculated with the ciaB mutant did not developed diarrhea until 3 days post infection and only exhibited minor histological lesions . Piglets inoculated with a ciaB mutant harboring a wild - type copy of the ciaB gene exhibited clinical signs of disease similar to piglets inoculated with the C . jejuni wild - type strain [ 21 ] . Given that the Cia proteins contrib - ute to the development of C . jejuni - mediated enteritis , additional work is warranted to further dissect the func - tions of these proteins . We recently identified a secreted protein , which we termed CiaD ( Cj0788 ) , that is exported from the flagel - lum and delivered to the cytosol of host cells . We found that CiaD activates the host cell kinases p38 and Erk 1 / 2 , resulting in the secretion of interleukin - 8 ( IL - 8 ) from host cells . Similarly , we found that CiaD - mediated activation of p38 and Erk 1 / 2 are required for maximal invasion of host cells by C . jejuni . CiaD function within host cells is dependent on a mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase - docking motif . Finally , CiaD was found to contribute to the development of disease , as evidenced by gross pathology and histopathology of tissues from IL - 10 knockout mice inoculated with a C . jejuni wild - type strain , ciaD mutant , and ciaD complemented isolate [ 22 ] . While it is known that CiaD contributes to C . jejuni invasion of host cells , the details of the molecular mechanisms of C . jejuni - host cell invasion are incomplete . The goal of this study was to determine the role of CiaD in C . jejuni host cell invasion . We hypothesized that the C . jejuni effector protein CiaD contributes to bacterial invasion by stimulation of Erk 1 / 2 and the phosphorylation of cortactin . We sought to identify the role of Erk 1 / 2 and cortactin in C . jejuni invasion of host cells . More specifically , we sought to determine if the phosphorylation of cortactin is necessary for C . jejuni in - vasion of host cells , and whether CiaD contributes to the phosphorylation of cortactin . Results Erk 1 / 2 and the C . jejuni CiaD effector protein are required for maximal invasion of human INT 407 epithelial cells Experiments were initially performed to determine if CiaD contributes to the activation of the Erk 1 / 2 signaling path - way . Consistent with previous work [ 22 ] , we found that CiaD is required for maximal invasion of host INT 407 cells ( Figure 1A ) and contributes to the complete acti - vation of the host cell kinase Erk 1 / 2 ( Figure 1B ) . INT 407 cells are a human epithelial cell line [ 23 ] . To de - termine if Erk 1 / 2 is involved in bacterial invasion , we performed a gentamicin protection assay in the presence of the MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor PD98059 ( a potent inhibitor of Erk 1 / 2 activation ) . Inhibition of Erk 1 / 2 activation was found to significantly decrease the number of C . jejuni internalized ( Figure 1C ) , which is consistent with previ - ous reports [ 24 , 25 ] . These results demonstrate that CiaD and Erk 1 / 2 are necessary for maximal host cell invasion by C . jejuni . CiaD is required for host cell membrane ruffling independent of Rho GTPase activation Three Rho GTPases ( i . e . , Rho , Rac1 , and Cdc42 ) are in - volved in the regulation and dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton [ 26 ] . C . jejuni invasion of host cells is accompanied by the activation of the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 [ 27 , 28 ] . Rac1 is involved in the formation of lamellipodia and Cdc42 is involved in the formation of filopodia [ 26 ] . We will refer to lamellipodia and filo - podia extensions , which are membrane protrusions as - sociated with reorganization of actin microfilaments , as membrane ruffles throughout the manuscript . Experiments Samuelson and Konkel Cell Communication and Signaling 2013 , 11 : 82 Page 2 of 15 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 11 / 1 / 82 were performed to assess membrane ruffling of INT 407 cells upon infection with the C . jejuni wild - type strain , ciaD mutant , and ciaD mutant expressing a wild - type copy of ciaD in trans ( ciaD complemented isolate ) , as well as cells infected with a C . jejuni wild - type strain that had been pretreated with the MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor PD98059 that blocks Erk 1 / 2 activation . Representative scanning elec - tron microscopy ( SEM ) images of the various C . jejuni strains interacting with host INT 407 cells are shown in Figure 2A1 - 9 . Both flagellated and non - flagellated bac - teria were visualized bound to the host cells . The obser - vation of non - flagellated bacteria bound to the cells was presumably due to the method of fixation , as all of the bacterial isolates were highly motile as judged by motility assays ( not shown ) . We observed that 28 . 8 % ± 6 . 9 % of untreated and uninfected INT 407 cells had membrane ruffling ( Figure 2A1 ) . In contrast , 57 . 9 % ± 5 . 7 % of INT 407 cells had pronounced membrane ruffling when inoc - ulated with a C . jejuni wild - type strain ( Figure 2A2 ) . Inoculation of INT 407 cells with the ciaD mutant resulted in membrane ruffling in 45 . 1 % ± 5 . 8 % of the cells ( Figure 2A3 ) , whereas inoculation of cells with the ciaD complemented isolate resulted in membrane ruffling in 55 . 8 % ± 5 . 6 % of the cells ( Figure 2A4 ) . Pretreatment of host cells with the Erk 1 / 2 inhibitor reduced the percent - age of host cells with membrane ruffling to 42 . 4 % ± 4 . 4 % Figure 1 CiaD and Erk 1 / 2 are required for maximal C . jejuni invasion .

Based on these data , we concluded that max - imal membrane ruffling of host INT 407 cells requires CiaD and Erk 1 / 2 . Given that the C . jejuni ciaD mutant was found to be deficient in stimulating membrane ruffling , we investi - gated whether there was a defect in Rho GTPase activa - tion . The ciaD mutant exhibited normal Rac1 ( Figure 2B ) and Cdc42 ( Figure 2C ) activity when compared to the C . jejuni wild - type strain , as determined by G - LISA ™ . The fact that the activation levels of the Rho GTPases are not changing in the C . jejuni ciaD mutant was in - teresting , as there were clear reductions in bacterial invasion and host cell membrane ruffling . These data indicate that activated Rac1 and Cdc42 require assembly and / or activation of scaffold or accessory proteins to fa - cilitate lamellipodia and filopodia extensions . Given the complexity of the C . jejuni - mediated invasion complex , we chose to focus on the role of CiaD - mediated Erk 1 / 2 activation and the potential targets of Erk 1 / 2 that par - ticipate in membrane ruffling . CiaD mediated Erk 1 / 2 activation is required for cortactin serine phosphorylation Experiments were performed to determine if Erk 1 / 2 par - ticipates in transcriptional regulation of genes and / or ac - tivation of cytosolic signaling proteins necessary for actin Figure 2 CiaD induced host cell membrane ruffling is Rho GTPase independent .

We first assessed the role of Erk 1 / 2 mediated transcriptional regulation in C . jejuni invasion of host cells . To prevent Erk 1 / 2 medi - ated transcriptional activation in response to infection with C . jejuni , host INT 407 cells were pre - treated with 5 , 6 - dichloro - 1 - beta - D - ribofuranosylbenzimidazole ( DRB ) . DRB inhibits Cdk - activating kinase ( a TFIIH - associated kinase ) , thereby preventing transcription by RNA polymerase II [ 29 ] . To determine the concentration of DRB necessary to inhibit transcription , cells were pre - treated with different concentrations of DRB and the secretion of interleukin - 8 ( IL - 8 ) from host cells was determined . The host cell che - mokine IL - 8 is transcribed , translated , and secreted from host cells in response to numerous bacterial pathogens , in - cluding C . jejuni [ 30 - 35 ] . Pretreatment of INT 407 cells with DRB resulted in a reduction in the amount of IL - 8 in supernatants from C . jejuni infected cells ( Figure 3A ) , suggesting that DRB effectively blocks the transcription of IL - 8 . However , pretreatment of INT 407 cells with DRB re - sulted in normal C . jejuni invasion of host cells ( Figure 3B ) . These results suggest that Erk 1 / 2 mediated transcriptional regulation is not involved in host cell actin cytoskeleton re - arrangement necessary for C . jejuni host cell invasion . Given that Erk 1 / 2 mediated transcriptional regulation is not required for cytoskeleton rearrangement , we per - formed experiments to determine if cytosolic signaling mediated by Erk 1 / 2 was altered or impaired . We chose to Figure 3 Erk 1 / 2 is necessary for cytosolic signaling required for maximal C . jejuni invasion of host cell . A .

In contrast to infection of INT 407 cells with a C . jejuni wild - type strain , the C . jejuni ciaD mutant was deficient in maximal phosphoryl - ation of cortactin at the Erk 1 / 2 phosphorylation sites S405 and S418 , as judged by immunoblot analysis with the S418 and S405 phospho - specific antibodies to cortactin ( Figure 3C ) . INT 407 cells infected with the C . jejuni ciaD complemented isolate restored the phosphorylation of cortactin to levels indistinguishable from infection with a C . jejuni wild - type strain ( Figure 3C ) . This finding indi - cates that CiaD mediated activation of Erk 1 / 2 leads to the phosphorylation of cortactin on serine residues . Consist - ent with the fact that CiaD mediates Erk 1 / 2 activation and Erk 1 / 2 mediates the phosphorylation of cortactin on S405 and S418 , we found that pretreatment of INT 407 cells with the MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor PD98059 reduced phos - phorylation of cortactin on S418 in response to C . jejuni infection , similar to the level observed in uninfected cells ( Figure 3D ) . The inhibition of cortactin serine phosphoryl - ation by treatment of cells with PD98059 is in agreement with published data [ 37 ] . However , this is the first report showing that cortactin becomes activated in response to C . jejuni infection . Given that CiaD is required for max - imal cortactin activation , we assessed the role of cortactin phosphorylation in C . jejuni invasion of host cells . Cortactin serine phosphorylation is required for maximal invasion To determine if cortactin is required for C . jejuni invasion of host cells , we used small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) to knockdown cortactin and siRNA to knockdown the down - stream complex protein N - WASP . N - WASP is a known component of the actin nucleation and polymerization complex and is necessary for the complete activation of Arp 2 / 3 . More specifically , serine phosphorylation of cor - tactin leads to the recruitment of N - WASP , activation of Arp 2 / 3 , and actin remodeling [ 36 ] . INT 407 cells were transfected with siRNA to cortactin or siRNA to N - WASP , and C . jejuni invasion of host cells was evaluated using the gentamicin protection assay . The knockdown of cortactin resulted in a significant reduction in the number of C . jejuni internalized by host cells ( Figure 4A ) . The knock - down of N - WASP also significantly reduced the amount of internalized C . jejuni ( Figure 4A ) . Effective knockdown of cortactin ( 60 . 6 % ± 3 . 3 % knockdown ) and N - WASP ( 67 . 8 % ± 1 . 1 % knockdown ) was demonstrated by immuno - blot analysis ( Figure 4B ) . These data support the proposal that cortactin and N - WASP are necessary for maximal C . jejuni invasion of host cells . To evaluate the specific contribution of Erk 1 / 2 phos - phorylation of cortactin at S405 and S418 in C . jejuni host cell invasion , phosphorylation null constructs of cortactin were utilized and the gentamicin protection assay was performed . INT 407 cells were transfected with cortactin - EGFP phosphorylation null constructs with the following mutations : S405A , S418A , and S405 / 418A ( double serine mutant ) . The contributions of c - Src ( tyrosine ) phosphorylation of cortactin were also evaluated , as c - Src phosphorylation of cortactin is known to be im - portant for the invasion of other pathogens [ 2 , 3 , 5 ] . INT 407 cells were transfected with cortactin - EGFP Y421F and Y421 / 470 / 486 F ( triple tyrosine mutant ) mutant constructs to evaluate the role of c - Src phosphorylation of cortactin . We found that both cortactin serine and tyrosine phos - phorylation are required for maximal invasion of host cells by C . jejuni , as judged by the gentamicin protection assay ( Figure 4C ) . Equal expression of the cortactin - EGFP phos - phorylation null constructs was confirmed via immunoblot analysis ( Figure 4D ) . In support of the finding that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for C . jejuni inva - sion , inhibition of the upstream kinase c - Src with the in - hibitor PP2 prevented C . jejuni internalization ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1 ) . This is the first report to our knowledge demonstrating that serine phosphorylation of cortactin by Erk 1 / 2 and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by c - Src are required for C . jejuni invasion of host cells . Based on these results , we hypothesized that cortactin and the serine phosphorylation of cortactin are necessary for C . jejuni - induced membrane ruffling . Cortactin serine phosphorylation is required for host cell membrane ruffling To evaluate the role of cortactin activation by CiaD in C . jejuni - mediated host cell membrane ruffling , we utilized EGFP - tagged cortactin to visualize membrane ruffling . INT 407 cells , which had been transfected with a cortactin - EGFP construct , were infected with the C . jejuni wild - type strain , ciaD mutant , and the ciaD comple - mented isolate and the cells examined by confocal microscopy . Uninfected cells transfected with cortactin - EGFP exhibited diffuse cortactin localization with no distinct membrane ruffling of cell borders ( Additional file 2 : Figure S2 A - D ) . However , infection with the C . jejuni wild - type stain resulted in membrane ruffling ( Additional file 2 : Figure S2 E - H ) . In contrast , the C . jejuni ciaD mu - tant was deficient in membrane ruffling and exhibited dif - fuse cortactin localization similar to that of uninfected cells ( Additional file 2 : Figure S2 I - L ) . Host cell membrane ruffling was restored when cells were infected with the C . jejuni ciaD complemented isolate ( Additional file 2 : Figure S2 M - P ) . While this experiment indicated that CiaD is necessary for C . jejuni - induced membrane ruffling , it was not clear if cortactin is required for membrane ruffling .

INT 407 cells , which had been transfected with cortactin - EGFP S405A , S418A , and S405 / 418A phosphorylation null constructs , were infected with a C . jejuni wild - type strain and evaluated by confocal microscopy . Uninfected cells transfected with cortactin - EGFP exhibited diffuse cortactin localization with no dis - tinct membrane ruffling of the cell borders ( Figure 5A - D ) . Infection of cortactin - EGFP transfected cells with the C . jejuni wild - type strain resulted in distinct membrane ruffling ( Figure 5E - H ) . C . jejuni infection of INT 407 cells transfected with EGFP - cortactin S405A ( Figure 5I - L ) , S418A ( Figure 5M - P ) , and S405 / 418A ( Figure 5Q - T ) phosphorylation null constructs resulted in a diffuse localization of cortactin and no observable membrane ruf - fling in response to C . jejuni was observed . These results indicate that cortactin is required for C . jejuni - induced membrane ruffling . Scanning electron microscopy was performed to de - termine the extent of C . jejuni - induced membrane ruf - fling in cells transfected with siRNA to cortactin and siRNA to N - WASP . More specifically , INT 407 cells were transfected with a scrambled siRNA , siRNA to cortactin , or siRNA to N - WASP , and infected with a C . jejuni wild - type strain . INT 407 cells were also trans - fected with cortactin - EGFP S405A , S418A , and S405 / 418A phosphorylation null constructs .

Treatment of host cells with siRNA to N - WASP and siRNA to cortactin reduced membrane ruffling to 26 . 8 % ± 6 . 0 % and 27 . 9 % ± 6 . 4 % , respectively ( Figure 6D and E ) . We also observed a significant decrease in host cell membrane ruffling when cells were transfected with phosphorylation null constructs of cortactin ( Figure 6F - H ) .

Noteworthy is that treatment of INT 407 cells with siRNA or phosphorylation null constructs pre - vented membrane ruffling from occurring even in the presence of direct bacterial contact ( compare panels J and K to panels L - P ) . These data indicate that cortactin and N - WASP are required for maximal membrane ruf - fling induced by C . jejuni .

Infection of INT 407 cells with a C . jejuni wild - type strain resulted in a significant increase ( above uninfected cells ) in the amount of phosphorylated ( activated ) cortactin ( Figure 7 ) . In contrast , the amount of activated cortactin significantly decreased in INT 407 cells infected with the C . jejuni ciaD mutant .

These data show that C . jejuni induces the formation of the actin nucleation and polymerization complex Erk 1 / 2 - cortactin - N - WASP , and that this associ - ation is , in part , dependent of the C . jejuni effector protein CiaD . These data also show that the recruitment of N - WASP to cortactin requires Erk 1 / 2 serine phosphoryl - ation of cortactin . Discussion This study was performed to further elucidate the mechan - ism of C . jejuni invasion of host cells . More specifically , we investigated the role of Erk 1 / 2 and cortactin in C . jejuni invasion of host cells . Erk 1 / 2 is a serine / threonine kinase that is part of the Ras - Raf - MEK - ERK signal transduction cascade . Erk 1 / 2 is activated by dual phosphorylation at Y204 / 187 and T202 / 185 catalyzed by MEK 1 / 2 [ 41 , 42 ] . Erk 1 / 2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of hundreds of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and participates in numerous cellular processes including cell adhesion , cell cycle progression , cell migration , cell survival , differen - tiation , metabolism , proliferation , and transcription [ 42 ] . Cortactin is a filamentous actin binding protein that is a crucial link between the organization of structural proteins , such as actin , and cellular signal transduction pathways . Cortactin stimulates actin polymerization via interaction with N - WASP through its SH3 domain , and binding of Arp 2 / 3 through its N - terminal domain [ 36 ] . Cortactin is regulated by phosphorylation of Y421 , Y470 , and Y486 by c - Src and other tyrosine kinases [ 36 ] . Likewise , Erk 1 / 2 phosphorylates S405 and S418 Figure 7 CiaD is required for Erk 1 / 2 - cortactin association . INT 407 cells were infected with a C . jejuni wild - type strain , ciaD mutant , ciaD complemented isolate , or uninfected ( control ) for 45 min . A . The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation experiments with an antibody against cortactin , separated by SDS - PAGE and blotted for cortactin , p - cortactin , N - WASP , and pErk 1 / 2 . Whole cell lysates ( WCL ) were also probed with an α - cortactin antibody to confirm similar inputs . Also shown are the blots of the IgG isotype control IP probed with cortactin , p - cortactin , N - WASP and pErk 1 / 2 antibodies . B . Band intensity of p - cortactin , N - WASP , and pErk 1 / 2 were normalized to total cortactin from three independent experiments . The asterisks indicate a significant difference ( P < 0 . 01 ) compared to the value obtained for the C . jejuni wild - type strain , as judged by one - way ANOVA followed by post - hoc Dunnett ’ s analysis . N . S . indicates no significant difference .

There is also evidence that PAK phosphorylates cortactin , however the implications of PAK serine phosphorylation are poorly defined [ 1 , 36 ] . Work by Martinez - Quiles et al . ( 2004 ) revealed that phos - phorylation of cortactin by Erk 1 / 2 acts as a positive regu - latory event and Src phosphorylation acts as a negative regulatory event in actin cytoskeletal rearrangement by ac - tivation / deactivation of N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 [ 40 ] . Add - itionally , Kelley et al . [ 39 ] demonstrated that concurrent phosphorylation of cortactin by Erk 1 / 2 and tyrosine ki - nases allow cells to regulate actin dynamics through N - WASP . Taken together , it is clear that the activation and deactivation of cortactin by phosphorylation is a dynamic process . In the present study , we showed that phosphoryl - ation of cortactin on S405 , S418 , Y421 , Y470 , and Y486 are required for maximal invasion of host cells by C . jejuni . Specifically , we show that CiaD is required for max - imal activation of Erk 1 / 2 ( Figure 1 ) . Activation of Erk 1 / 2 leads to the phosphorylation of S405 and S418 on cortactin ( Figure 3 ) . Also , the association of cortactin with Erk 1 / 2 is dependent on CiaD ( Figure 7 ) . Further - more , we found that serine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for maximal C . jejuni induced host cell membrane ruffling . These findings provide the basis for a detailed model of C . jejuni invasion of host cells ( Figure 8 ) . Previous work has shown that Dock180 and its bind - ing partner ELMO ( Engulfment and Cell Motility ) form a bipartite guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) , resulting in the activation of Rac1 and membrane ruf - fling [ 27 ] . C . jejuni invasion of cells is also accompanied by the activation of Cdc42 [ 28 , 45 ] . Interestingly , several effector proteins from Salmonella enterica , including SopE , SopE2 and SopB , modulate the activity of Cdc42 and Rac1 to manipulate actin cytoskeleton rearrange - ments [ 48 , 49 ] . Noteworthy is that the IcsA effector protein from Shigella flexneri promotes filopodia forma - tion by binding and activating N - WASP in a Cdc42 - like fashion [ 50 ] . To determine the role of CiaD in C . jejuni in - vasion of host cells , we first evaluated the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 as a loss in the activation of either Figure 8 Model of C . jejuni internalization . C . jejuni invasion of host cells . Step 1 : C . jejuni binds to fibronectin ( Fn ) via the two C . jejuni Fn binding proteins CadF ( blue dots ) and FlpA ( yellow dots ) [ 43 , 44 ] causing activation of the α 5 β 1 integrin receptors and the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) [ 27 , 45 ] . Step 2 : Activation of the α 5 β 1 integrin leads to the recruitment and partial activation of FAK and paxillin [ 27 , 46 ] . Step 3 : The delivery of the Campylobacter invasion antigens ( e . g . , CiaD shown in red ) to the host cell [ 16 , 19 , 27 , 47 ] leads to the maximal activation of key components of the focal complex ( i . e . , FAK , paxillin , vinculin , p130Cas , Src , and the CrkII / DOCK - 180 / ELMO complex ) [ 27 , 28 , 45 , Konkel et . al , Invasion of epithelial cells by Campylobacter jejuni is independent of caveolin - 1 , In Submission ] . Step 4 : Focal complex activation , in conjunction with CiaD , leads to the phosphorylation of Erk 1 / 2 . Caveolin - 1 , Vav2 , Rac1 , and Cdc42 are also activated following focal complex activation [ 27 , 28 , 45 ] . Step 5 : Activation of Erk 1 / 2 and Src leads to the phosphorylation of cortactin , which allows for the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 to activate N - WASP associated with phosphorylated cortactin , promoting actin cytoskeletal reorganization . Highlighted in this model is the role of CiaD in C . jejuni internalization . Specifically , CiaD is necessary for the maximal activation of the Erk 1 / 2 and cortactin signaling pathways . Components of the focal complex and focal complex associated proteins are shown in blue . The newly identified components of the C . jejuni invasion complex are shown in green . Samuelson and Konkel Cell Communication and Signaling 2013 , 11 : 82 Page 11 of 15 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 11 / 1 / 82 protein could explain the invasion deficiency of the ciaD mutant . INT 407 cells infected with the C . jejuni ciaD mutant exhibited levels of Rho GTPase activation similar to that of cells infected with the C . jejuni wild - type strain . This is in stark contrast to cells infected with a C . jejuni ciaC mutant that display a significant reduction in Rac1 activation [ 27 ] . The reduction in Rac1 activity with the C . jejuni ciaC mutant is in agreement with the fact that there are fewer sites of co - localized Rac1 in INT 407 cells infected with the C . jejuni ciaC mutant versus a C . jejuni wild - type strain [ 27 ] . Our data supports the pro - posal that CiaD is manipulating cellular signaling cascades and altering actin nucleation at a site downstream from Rac1 and Cdc42 . Moreover , our results indicate that CiaC and CiaD manipulate at least two distinct host cell targets that are necessary for C . jejuni invasion of host cells . Based on the observation that Erk 1 / 2 is critical for C . jejuni invasion of host cells , we performed experiments to determine if : 1 ) Erk 1 / 2 is transcriptionally regulating cellular components involved in cell invasion ; and / or 2 ) Erk 1 / 2 is necessary for the activation of cytosolic cellular signaling cascades involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement . We found that the transcription of the gene that encodes for IL - 8 is not required for invasion , but that Erk 1 / 2 is re - quired for the serine phosphorylation of cortactin . As pre - viously stated , cortactin is an actin - binding protein that recruits N - WASP and activates Arp 2 / 3 , leading to actin remodeling [ 36 ] . Interestingly , Erk 1 / 2 activation stimu - lates bacterial capture of Shigella by filopodia [ 51 ] , while the OspF effector protein from Shigella harbors phosphat - ase activity to inactivate mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , including Erk 1 / 2 , c - Jun N - terminal kinase , and p38 , post - invasion [ 52 ] . Collectively , these data highlight the fact that Erk 1 / 2 is a key component of the C . jejuni invasion complex and that bacterial pathogens can ma - nipulate membrane extensions ( e . g . , lamellipodia and filo - podia ) by targeting Erk 1 / 2 . Cortactin is likely involved in the uptake of patho - genic bacteria into host cells , as it acts in concert with N - WASP to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . It is plausible for a pathogen to activate cortactin directly or to acti - vate cortactin indirectly via Erk 1 / 2 or Src . For example , the IpaC effector protein from Shigella mediates Src - dependent phosphorylation of cortactin , thereby pro - moting actin polymerization [ 53 ] . We found that serine phosphorylation of cortactin by C . jejuni is dependent upon Erk 1 / 2 , as the level of phospho - cortactin in C . jejuni infected cells treated with the PD98059 inhibitor was indis - tinguishable from uninfected cells . Here we demonstrate that the formation of the Erk 1 / 2 - cortactin - N - WASP complex is dependent on the C . jejuni effector protein CiaD . To our knowledge this is the first re - port of the involvement of cortactin and N - WASP in host cell invasion by C . jejuni . In addition , this is the first report showing that Erk 1 / 2 mediated serine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for C . jejuni invasion of host cells . Fu - ture studies will focus on the identification of the direct target of CiaD and the kinetics and regulation of cortactin in bacterial invasion . This work provides new insight into C . jejuni pathogenesis and the complex signaling events exploited by bacterial pathogens during the process of invasion . Equally important , it contributes to the un - derstanding of the phosphorylation of cortactin in bac - terial infection . Conclusion In this study , we present a model for C . jejuni invasion of host cells ( Figure 8 ) . We show that C . jejuni acti - vates Erk 1 / 2 . Specifically , we found that Erk 1 / 2 activa - tion is dependent on the C . jejuni effector protein CiaD . Similarly , we found that Erk 1 / 2 activation is necessary for bacterial invasion because it is necessary for the phos - phorylation of serine residues in cortactin . Moreover , in - hibition of serine phosphorylation results in decreased bacterial invasion and host cell membrane ruffling . The requirement of serine phosphorylation of cortactin by Erk 1 / 2 in C . jejuni host cell invasion represents a mech - anistic basis for how Erk 1 / 2 inhibition leads to impaired C . jejuni invasion . Methods Bacterial strains , tissues culture types The Campylobacter jejuni F38011 clinical isolate was used in this study . All C . jejuni isolates were cultured on Muller - Hinton agar plates containing bovine citrated blood ( MHB ) with the appropriate antibiotic at the following final concentrations : chloramphenicol 8 microgram / mL and tetracycline 2 microgram / mL . Cultures were grown at 37° C in a microaerobic chamber ( 5 % O 2 , 10 % CO 2 , and 85 % N 2 ) . INT 407 cells ( ATCC CCL 6 ) were obtained form the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . INT 407 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium ( MEM ) sup - plemented with 10 mM sodium pyruvate , 20 mM glutam - ine , and 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . Preparation of INT 407 whole cell lysates Whole cell lysates ( WCL ) of INT 407 cells were pre - pared by the addition of lysis buffer , as described previ - ously [ 27 ] . The lysates were collected and analyzed by SDS - PAGE coupled with immunoblot analyses . The pro - tein concentration of each sample was determined by the bicinchoninic acid ( BCA , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) protein assay and normalized prior to SDS - PAGE . Immunoblot analysis , cellular inhibitors , antibodies , and densitometry analysis Immunoblots were performed as described previously [ 27 ] . INT 407 cell lysates were collected and analyzed by Samuelson and Konkel Cell Communication and Signaling 2013 , 11 : 82 Page 12 of 15 http : / / www . biosignaling . com / content / 11 / 1 / 82 SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .

The α - rabbit IgG or the α - mouse IgG ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) secondary antibodies were applied at a 1 : 2000 dilu - tion for 1 h at room temperature . Band intensity was quantified using a LAS 4000 mini ( GE healthcare ) and the Multi Gauge V3 . 0 ( Fujifilm , Valhalla , NY ) software pack - age . Densitometry analysis is shown as the ratio of phosphoprotein to total protein ( i . e . , p - Erk 1 / 2 to total Erk 1 / 2 and p - cortactin to total cortactin ) or as the ratio of target protein to cortactin in the IP experiments ( i . e . , N - WASP to total cortactin and p - Erk 1 / 2 to total cortactin ) . Inhibitors or vehicle [ dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ] were added to INT 407 cells 30 min prior to infection and maintained throughout the assay . The Erk 1 / 2 inhibitor PD98059 ( Selleck , Houston , TX , Cat # S1177 ) was used at 50 μ M . The c - Src inhibitor PP2 ( Sigma , Cat # P0042 ) was used at 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 μ g / mL . The transcription inhibitor 5 , 6 - dichloro - 1 - beta - D - ribofuranosylbenzimidazole ( DRB ) ( Sigma , Cat # D1916 ) was used at 10 , 20 , and 40 μ M . Cell death was quantified with trypan blue staining . No signifi - cant death of INT 407 cells was observed with any of the treatments ( not shown ) . Binding and internalization assays Binding and internalization assays were performed as described elsewhere [ 27 ] . INT 407 cells were seeded at a density of 1 . 5 × 10 5 into 24 - well flat bottom tissue cul - ture trays ( BD Falcon , Franklin Lakes , NJ , Cat # 353047 ) . Bacteria were suspended in MEM containing 1 % FBS and added to cells at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 100 . Trays were centrifuged at 800 × g to promote bacterial cell contact . Cells were lysed with 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 and plated onto MHB agar for bacterial enumeration . C . jejuni host cell invasion was assessed by lysing INT 407 cells and enumerating the internalized bacteria following a 3 h incu - bation with 250 microgram / mL of gentamicin .
