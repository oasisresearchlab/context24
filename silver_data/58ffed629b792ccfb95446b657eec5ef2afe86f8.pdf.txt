The research involved detailing the knowledge reuse process in six case studies varying in degree of innovation . Across the six cases , a six - stage reuse - for - innovation process was identiﬁed consisting of three major actions : reconceptualize the problem and approach , including deciding to search for others’ ideas to reuse ; search - and - evaluate others’ ideas to reuse ; and develop the selected idea . Findings include ( 1 ) the need for an insurmountable gap in performance to stimulate the decision to reuse others’ knowledge ; ( 2 ) the critical importance of an adapter to bridge the idea source and recipient ; ( 3 ) three layers of search - and - evaluate activities in which the ﬁrst layer of scanning to ﬁnd ideas to reuse and the last layer of detailed analysis of ideas are bridged by a layer of brief evaluations of ideas assessing the presence ( or absence ) of targeted information about each idea ; and ( 4 ) the differential use of metaknowledge about each idea to facilitate proceeding through each search - and - evaluate layer . In addition , reusers in the more ( versus less ) innovative cases redeﬁned problems at the outset in nontraditional ways using analogies and extensions , rather than accepting the preexisting problem deﬁnition ; used a substantially broader search strategy with a greater variety of search methods ; and worked more closely with adapters during the latter stages of the reuse process .

This paper was with the authors for 8 months for 2 revisions . Pete , the project manager , read the Announcement of Opportunity , which called for the development of an instrument that autonomously detects and measures dust devils on Mars . Dust devils are notoriously difﬁ - cult to predict and yet carry with them enough force to upset equipment , and dust so ﬁne that it poses a hazard to future human exploration of the Red Planet . As a 20 - year veteran of space mission development , Pete considered the use of “standard” ( if there is a standard for Mars ) meteorological solutions but they didn’t provide the advance - warning capability . More - over , it wasn’t “sexy” enough for the NASA sponsors , so transfer of known practices wasn’t feasible . Pete considered developing a solution from scratch , but the project resources didn’t allow the time or money . So Pete embarked on a search for ideas that he could reuse and adapt to innovate . What did Pete do to ﬁnd those ideas , how did he evaluate them when he found them , and what are the implications of Pete’s behaviors and decisions for knowledge management ? These are the questions this paper addresses . Introduction Knowledge transfer is the process through which knowledge acquired in one situation is applied to another ( Argote and Ingram 2000 ) . We adopt a broad deﬁnition of knowledge consistent with prior research : explicit knowledge such as drawings , analytic results , and scientiﬁc journal articles , as well as tacit knowledge such as insights , intuition , and implied assumptions ( Beccerra - Fernandez and Sabherwal 2001 , Grant 1996 , Kogut and Zander 1992 , Polanyi 1966 , Teece 1981 ) . Knowledge transfer can generally be subdivided into knowledge sharing ( the process by which an entity’s knowledge is captured ; Appleyard 1996 ) and knowledge reuse ( the process by which an entity is able to locate and use shared knowledge ; Alavi and Leidner 2001 ) . We are focused on knowledge reuse . In this paper , we are interested in knowledge reuse for the express purpose of facilitating the development of radically innovative solutions . Inno - vative solutions are deﬁned as solutions that repre - sent creative ( i . e . , novel and useful ) ideas that are implemented ( Amabile 1996 ) . Radical innovation is differentiated from incremental innovation by involv - ing discontinuous development where unprecedented improvements or performance features are achieved 174 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 129 . 128 . 216 . 34 ] on 30 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 10 : 02 .

Majchrzak , Cooper , and Neece : Knowledge Reuse for Innovation Management Science 50 ( 2 ) , pp . 174 – 188 , ©2004 INFORMS 175 ( Leifer et al . 2000 ) . From a knowledge reuse perspec - tive , reuse for radical innovation is the exploitation of existing diverse ideas previously unknown to the innovator when creating a new product or service ( Armbrecht et al . 2001 ) . Kogut and Zander ( 1992 ) describe this ability of the ﬁrm to generate new com - binations of existing knowledge as combinative capa - bilities . Grant ( 1996 ) argues that such a capability is a strategically signiﬁcant resource to a competitive organization . Given the importance of understanding how these new combinations of knowledge are created , iden - tifying ways to facilitate innovators’ search and reuse behavior is an appropriate objective . If inno - vators limit their search for solutions to their cur - rent personal knowledge base or existing network of sources , the extent to which radical innovation is achieved will be limited ( Leifer et al . 2000 , Clark and Fujimoto 1991 ) . When innovators reuse others’ knowledge which was previously unknown to them , the creativity envelope is expanded beyond a small set of individuals ( Armbrecht et al . 2001 ) . Thus , a knowledge management system that expands the creativity envelope improves the research and devel - opment process through quicker access and move - ment of new knowledge . Moreover , improving the use of knowledge in innovation has beneﬁts to the practical ﬁeld of knowledge management . According to a 1997 Ernst & Young survey of executives ( cited in Holsapple and Joshi 2000 ) , innovation is seen as the area of greatest payoff from knowledge manage - ment , even though such efforts to date have mostly focused on operational productivity improvements ( Davenport et al . 1996 ) . Existing Literature on Knowledge Reuse There are several frameworks in the literature for understanding knowledge reuse . Grant ( 1996 ) cate - gorizes these frameworks into those that focus on knowledge acquisition ( or replication ) and those that focus on knowledge integration . For example , stud - ies on spillover effects of knowledge between related research programs , product generations , and manu - facturing organizations , as well as studies of best - practice transfers ( see review by Argote 1999 ) focus on how a “recipient organization” acquires and applies the knowledge of the “source organization” in an effort to replicate the essential elements of the source’s knowledge . Szulanski ( 2000 ) provides an example of a study with this “knowledge reuse as replica - tion” ( KRR ) focus . Grant ( 1996 ) , however , argues that knowledge acquisition is not necessarily an efﬁ - cient approach when the objective is radical inno - vation . With radical innovation , knowledge is not only acquired but also integrated across disparate sources of specialized knowledge . While acquisition may beneﬁt from Nonaka’s ( 1994 ) conversion of tacit into explicit knowledge , for example , and from Brown and Duguid’s ( 1991 ) communities of practices , Grant argues that knowledge integration requires different—as yet underresearched—mechanisms . In addition to Grant’s claims , there is research from the literature on innovation to indicate that the frame - works and ﬁndings from the KRR literature may actu - ally restrict , rather than facilitate , effective reuse for innovation . As one example , knowledge reuse is often thought to increase with initial shared experiences between source and recipient ( Argote 1999 , Brown and Duguid 1991 , Hansen 1999 , Kogut and Zander 1992 , Nonaka 1994 ) . That is , the more familiar you are with a source , the more likely you are to reuse the source’s knowledge . However , research on innovation diffusion ( Rogers 1983 ) , new product development ( Dougherty 1992 ) , creativity ( Amabile 1996 , Unsworth 2001 ) , and how people reuse knowledge when inno - vating ( Swan 2001 , Gray 2000 ) comes to the opposite conclusion : divergence and lack of shared experiences are critical for developing new ideas . For example , Hargadon and Sutton ( 1997 ) explain why IDEO is so productive at repeatedly generating innovative ideas : employees identify solutions in other domains that have nothing in common with their focal domain . Allen’s ( 1977 ) research demonstrates that innovators get creative ideas from a variety of sources , including searches of knowledge bases with unknown sources . Thus , knowledge reuse for radical innovation ( KRI ) may not rely on shared experiences between sources and recipients as completely as KRR . KRI may also differ from KRR in the evaluation cri - teria applied to knowledge being reused . While any knowledge is likely to be reinvented as it is reused ( Argote 1999 , Rice and Rogers 1980 ) , adaptation of knowledge is likely to be greater and more deliberate in radical innovation than in the transfer of best prac - tices . Does this greater need for adaptation affect how knowledge is evaluated ? For example , is knowledge that is being considered for reuse in a KRI process evaluated not only for its reuse potential but also for its adaptation potential ? KRI may also differ from KRR in the content of the knowledge being transferred . Szulanski ( 2000 ) and Zander and Kogut ( 1995 ) found that practices with clear cause and effect relationships that were codiﬁed and trainable were more easily transferred . However , because radical innovation involves the transfer and integration of largely tacit knowledge ( Leonard and Sensiper 1998 ) , the knowledge being transferred is likely to be ambiguous , incompletely codiﬁed , and complex . This requires reusers in a KRI D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 129 . 128 . 216 . 34 ] on 30 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 10 : 02 .

Majchrzak , Cooper , and Neece : Knowledge Reuse for Innovation 176 Management Science 50 ( 2 ) , pp . 174 – 188 , ©2004 INFORMS process to ﬁnd ways to understand the tacit knowl - edge being transferred . Clark ( 1996 ) and Star and Griesemer ( 1989 ) have theorized that tacit knowl - edge transfer is facilitated by the use of shared arti - facts . These artifacts convey contextual information about the knowledge being shared , helping to clar - ify the meaning underlying ambiguous knowledge . This would suggest that physical artifacts may play a particularly important role in the KRI process . Finally , we do not know what a staged model for the KRI process looks like . Radical innovation proceeds less as stages from conceptualization to com - mercialization ( as is found with incremental devel - opment ) and more as sporadic trajectory changes in response to unanticipated events ( Cheng and Van de Ven 1996 , Leifer et al . 2000 ) . For example , in radical innovation , idea generation and opportunity recogni - tion do not occur at the front end as in incremental development , but sporadically throughout and often in response to organization , technical , and market dis - continuities ( Dougherty 1992 ) . Thus , knowledge reuse that occurs within a radical innovation work process may not proceed as a staged model ﬂowing from opportunity recognition to execution ( Szulanski 2000 ) or tacit - to - explicit - to - tacit conversion ( Nonaka 1994 ) . For example , Thomke ( 1998 ) and Kelly ( 1970 ) suggest that tacit conversion in the form of experiments occur throughout the KRI process , not just at the beginning and end . This review suggests that researchers need to study KRI in its own right by examining how knowledge is reused during the actual work process of innovat - ing . In particular , we are interested in answering the following questions : How is knowledge reused for radical innovation ? Is this reuse process fundamen - tally different from previous studies depicting a KRR process ? Research Design Our research question suggests a research design in which we build rather than test theory . More - over , our research design requires examining reuse as part of the actual work process of innovation , requiring ethnographic research methods ( Blackler 1995 , Schultze and Boland 2000 ) . Thus , we apply Eisenhardt’s ( 1989 ) guidelines for theory - building case study research in conjunction with the guidelines for hypothesis - generation case study research offered by Yin ( 1984 ) and Klein and Myers ( 1999 ) . Table 1 summarizes our study design , comparing it to recom - mendations made by Eisenhardt ( 1989 ) . Case Selection . Our case study research involved collecting and comparing data from six cases of reuse for innovation at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) .

Started in the 1930s , JPL has conceived and executed missions to use robotic spacecraft to explore all of the solar system’s known planets ( except Pluto ) . Thus , JPL specializes in developing technologies and concepts that have not been used previously , i . e . , radical innovation . The six cases were selected from an initial pool of 15 cases identiﬁed through interviews with man - agers at JPL . The pool of cases came from two projects that had been supported by internal JPL funds . These funds were earmarked to develop detailed propos - als in response to a NASA announcement of oppor - tunity ( AO ) .

The cases in the pool were stratiﬁed by degree of innovation ; innovation was deﬁned as degree of discontinuity in form , ﬁt , or function from gener - ally accepted approaches to the same problems . The manager of both projects along with the participant - observer made judgments about the degree of inno - vation in each case and the level of conﬁdence that the current approach would continue beyond the pro - posal selection process into development . 1 From this pool , we selected six cases where conﬁdence in the solution being continued into development was high , and which ranged from little innovation to substantial radical innovation . We stopped at studying six cases when theoretical saturation was achieved . This num - ber of six cases falls well within Eisenhardt’s ( 1989 ) suggestion of 3 – 10 cases required for theory building . The six cases are described in Table 2 . 1 The JPL product development life cycle begins with concept development and proceeds through preliminary design , develop - ment , integration and testing , and operations . To reduce risk , pro - posal teams strive to create as mature a concept as possible during proposal generation . In the two projects we picked , concept devel - opment and preliminary design were part of the proposal develop - ment , after which the project team underwent a NASA competitive selection process . Thus , the six stages of knowledge reuse occurred during the concept development and preliminary design activities and , for Project 1 , continued after selection . In sum , by selecting six reuse cases arrayed along a continuum of innovation , we believe we have met Yin’s ( 1984 ) call for replication logic in case selection . In addition , we have met Eisenhardt’s ( 1989 ) call for selection to be based on a population ( i . e . , as the pop - ulation of cases of reuse for innovation ) that controls for extraneous variation . The six cases came from the same organization , JPL , thus controlling for organi - zational culture that encourages innovation ( Amabile 1996 ) . The six cases came from two similar projects , thus controlling for task differences , a factor found by Becerra - Fernandez and Sabherwal ( 2001 ) to affect knowledge reuse . Finally , all six cases were led by the same manager , thus controlling for the important role played by project managers in new product develop - ment efforts ( Clark and Fujimoto 1991 ) . Data Collection . Building on a tradition in the innovation literature of using retrospective tracer studies ( Rogers 1983 ) , data collection focused on developing a detailed timeline for each case . These timelines were developed based on review of documents ( AO , ﬁnal proposals , e - mails , and engineering notes ) and repeated interviews with reusers in each case . A minimum of two informants per case were used in addition to the archival infor - mation . The informants included reusers and team members participating in team discussions with the reusers .

Majchrzak , Cooper , and Neece : Knowledge Reuse for Innovation 178 Management Science 50 ( 2 ) , pp . 174 – 188 , ©2004 INFORMS The interview protocol consisted of a set of struc - tured , open - ended questions asking informants to describe the knowledge they reused , reasons why they reused this knowledge , the problem that they were trying to solve with the reused knowledge , the initial state of their domain knowledge for solv - ing the problem prior to ﬁnding the reused knowl - edge , a description of the reused knowledge ( in terms of the form , ﬁt , and function it was serving when they discovered it ) , how the reused knowledge was discovered and evaluated , and what they did with the reused knowledge . Because the events had taken place a relatively short time before the interviews were conducted , the informants were able to answer these detailed questions . Because multiple informants were used for each case , differences between the informants arose ; however , these differences were generally attributable to the different roles that the different informants played , rather than to conﬂicts . Nevertheless , when differences arose , we shared these with the informants to determine if our interpre - tations of the differences were correct . Thus , the multiple informants allowed us to generate a more comprehensive timeline of events than we could have obtained from any single informant . 2 In addition to the use of multiple informants , stan - dardized interview protocol , and standardized data collection format of timelines , Eisenhardt ( 1989 ) rec - ommends that theory - building case study research should consider the use of multiple investigators with complementary insights . We were fortunate because our research team consisted of a senior faculty mem - ber , a doctoral student intern who was given permis - sion to join JPL’s knowledge management team for a year and spend time at JPL learning the culture and context , and a development engineer who had par - ticipated in an operational ( rather than innovation - generation ) capacity on the two projects and thus served as a participant observer . To avoid bias during the interviewing process , the participant - observer did not conduct the interviews ; however , her ﬁrst - hand experience with the team provided a perspective not typically obtained through interviews . An example of a timeline ( for the most - innovative case ) is shown in Figure 1 . 3 Results Because Szulanski ( 2000 ) provides one of the few operationalizations of stages in the knowledge 2 The timelines span different periods , but all start with concept development and include preliminary design activities which cul - minated in a high - conﬁdence commitment to a speciﬁc design approach . During the study period , the instruments under develop - ment reached varying degrees of maturity ranging from conceptual design to actual hardware . 3 The remaining timelines can be accessed on the senior author’s website at www - rcf . usc . edu / ∼ majchrza . transfer process , and his process is conceptually similar to Rogers’s ( 1983 ) well - respected innovation - decision process , we initially tried to code each action taken in the timeline by the stages offered by Szulanski ( 2000 ) : “Formation of transfer seed , ” “Decision to transfer , ” “First day of use , ” and “Achievement of satisfactory performance . ” During the coding process , we found that the time - line actions did not fall neatly into Szulanski’s stages ; nevertheless , there were sufﬁciently similar actions across the six cases that actions could be coded , then grouped by precedence ordering . The actions for all the cases were then displayed on a single chart to observe commonalities across the cases . A summary of this chart is shown in Table 3 and is described in the remainder of this section . 4 Reconceptualization Stage For each case , the reuse process began not with the formation of a “transfer seed , ” as suggested by Szulanski ( 2000 ) , but with a deﬁnition of the problem . The participants had the option to narrowly interpret the problem as portrayed in the NASA AO . In the least - innovative case ( mag patches ) , they chose that option . In the other ﬁve cases , however , the respon - dents chose to redeﬁne the problem in a way that would beneﬁt from an infusion of as - yet unknown ideas , requiring the need for radical innovation . For example , in the most - innovative case ( Lidar ) , the par - ticipants chose not only to characterize the meteoro - logical phenomenon as called for in the AO but also to create an early warning system . In the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) design case , the reuser describes his reconceptualization : The AO called for measurement to be taken on par - ticles of < 1 micron . The traditional approaches were rejected as imposing too many constraints ( size , sam - ple type and preparation , high vacuum and volt - age requirements ) . So the scientist considered a new approach , atomic force microscope . Respondents offered several reasons why they believed radical redeﬁnitions were necessary . First , these redeﬁnitions were motivated by the competitive nature of the “marketplace , ” in which proposed Mars projects that were perceived as having greater impact on the scientiﬁc community were more likely to be selected in the NASA competitive process . The respondents had some belief that radically different ideas would offer the greatest beneﬁts to the sci - entiﬁc community . Characteristics of the individual ( i . e . , recipient ) also played a role in the redeﬁnition 4 The speciﬁc pattern - matching tables on which this summary table is based can be accessed on the senior author’s website at www - rcf . usc . edu / ∼ majchrza .

Thus , they had signiﬁcant interest in innovating as well as the requi - site experience in their ﬁeld to know what was inno - vative and what was not . Project factors also appeared to inﬂuence the degree of innovation desired . There was only a limited amount of funding and risk that was acceptable . Innovators , together with other project members , decided which ideas ( and AO prob - lems ) would be handled in a more - or - less innovative fashion . Finally , the organizational factor of JPL affected which problems to redeﬁne : JPL was per - ceived in the science community as having a spe - cial expertise in space instruments ( which was the focus of the redeﬁnition for the three most - innovative cases ) , rather than in space materials ( the focus in the two least - innovative cases ) . As a ﬁrst step in the KRI process , then , radical reconceptualization was necessary to set the stage for innovation to occur , regardless of whether the solu - tion would eventually be reused or new . The radical reconceptualization established a challenging vision— a goal that excited , motivated , and directed the scien - tists’ efforts to strive for an unknown future state . Simultaneously with their radical redeﬁnitions , reusers in the more innovative cases developed con - ceptual approaches which were ambitious and not tied to the past ; they used analogies and extensions to anchor the concepts . For example , the reuser in the most - innovative case used the analogy of an earth - based thunderstorm warning radar to describe an instrument to detect dust devils on Mars : Our focus was on developing an instrument to study dust devils on Mars . But the problem was how do you get a machine to tell when the dust devil has arrived and turn the machine on to take pictures and mea - surements . Well , I thought about radars at airports . Isn’t this what radars do ? But radar can’t be used here because it has a much longer wave length and needs harder things like airplanes . Lidar , however , could be used . Point it at the sky , swivel it around , and tell whether there is a dust devil . This is a novel use of Lidar . To use analogies and extensions required reusers in the more - innovative cases to not only be knowl - edgeable about traditional approaches , but also to be aware of , and open to , nontraditional approaches that D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 129 . 128 . 216 . 34 ] on 30 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 10 : 02 .

Majchrzak , Cooper , and Neece : Knowledge Reuse for Innovation 182 Management Science 50 ( 2 ) , pp . 174 – 188 , ©2004 INFORMS might lead to greater levels of innovation . For exam - ple , in the second - most innovative case ( electrometer ( ELM ) design ) , the reuser generally knew of devices that measure electrostatic properties on earth . This inspired him to believe that there may be a way to measure electrostatic properties on Mars and thus propose such a conceptual approach . He extended the basic principles via an analogy to other measurement devices such as pressure gauges , and by using a robot arm as an analogy for the motion of an astronaut on the surface of Mars . In sum , at this early reconceptualization stage , individuals needed to balance the apparent paradox of suggesting wildly ambitious conceptualizations , while having conﬁdence that someone , somewhere , would have an idea that would help them opera - tionalize their ideas . Decision to Search Having reconceptualized the problem and approach , the respondents proceeded to the next stage : the decision to initiate a search for reusable knowledge . Unlike Szulanski’s ( 2000 ) decision to transfer , this sec - ond stage involved individuals considering whether to invent their own solution—a clearly preferred strategy as inventors—or to examine others’ ideas for possible reuse . For our respondents to even consider examining others’ ideas required that they acknowl - edge that they did not have the personal expertise in the required area and that their aim in searching oth - ers’ ideas was not simply to support personal learning ( so they could invent ) , but to actually reuse another’s ideas . We found that before engaging in a search for reusable knowledge , our respondents needed to expe - rience an “insurmountable performance gap , ” result - ing from severe time and / or cost constraints . For example , in both the most - and least - innovative cases , inventing one’s own solution was deemed too expen - sive . In the words of the scientist involved in the most innovative ( Lidar ) case : The major problem was the cost cap . Full - up develop - ment would have broken the bank . In the other cases , there was insufﬁcient time to invent a solution . Only with the insurmountable per - formance gap were the respondents willing to admit that they could not invent their own solution and that they would therefore consider reusing others’ ideas . Search and Evaluate Stage Having decided to consider reusing others’ ideas , respondents proceeded into a stage of active search - ing . In this third stage of the knowledge reuse pro - cess , we found that three layers of search and analysis were needed for reuse to occur : ( 1 ) Scanning the environment to become aware of possible ideas , ( 2 ) Conducting brief evaluations of ideas to deter - mine if the idea was worth pursuing , and ( 3 ) Conducting an in - depth analysis of the idea . Scanning . Respondents in all six cases engaged in scanning behavior , during which ideas and indi - viduals with potential relevance to the conceptual approach were identiﬁed . Reusers in the more innova - tive cases conducted much broader searches extend - ing into nontraditional areas , resulting in ideas that came from sectors beyond their immediate space com - munity , did not ﬁt the immediate functional require - ments , or did not have the expected or needed form . For example , in the second - most innovative case ( ELM design ) , ELMs to measure the electrostatic properties of dust ( the conceptual approach ) did not exist at the outset of the timeline . Therefore , the reuser could not simply look for the right ELM . Instead , he searched for information about how ELMs work in general and how various industries use ELMs . One of the ideas he discovered from this search was that the British textile industry worries a great deal about the electrostatic properties of chair covers ; consequently , the industry routinely uses ELMs to measure the elec - trostatic properties of various materials . Thus , a space scientist developing an instrument for Mars reused ideas from the British textile industry ! In the words of this scientist : I worked by analogy . I looked around to see what oth - ers were doing in the ﬁeld : (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) semiconductor indus - try , electrostatic discharge industry . [ There are ] a num - ber of companies that deal with clean room gar - ments ; chair covers [ that result in ] minimal static build up . [ There was ] some help from the textile industry [ for example , an individual ] (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) from the British textile industry . In addition to broad search criteria , reusers in the more - innovative cases used a wide variety of search methods ranging from the Internet to face - to - face vis - its , using both strong and weak ties . For example , in the most - innovative case ( Lidar design ) , strong and weak ties , formal “introductions” via the AO , tele - phone , e - mail , and the Internet were all used to ﬁnd people and artifacts related to Lidar . Conducting Brief Evaluations . Having scanned the environment to become aware of others’ ideas , the reuser proceeded to brieﬂy evaluate each selected idea . Three criteria were applied to decide if an idea should be either discarded or continued into an in - depth analysis : credibility ( the idea is valid and repli - cable ) , relevance ( there is some degree of match with problem needs in terms of form , such as shape and materials ; ﬁt , such as size and weight ; and / or techni - cal functionality ) , and adaptability ( the extent to which the idea can be modiﬁed to ﬁt the new problem within time and cost constraints ) . When evaluating D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 129 . 128 . 216 . 34 ] on 30 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 10 : 02 . F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Majchrzak , Cooper , and Neece : Knowledge Reuse for Innovation Management Science 50 ( 2 ) , pp . 174 – 188 , ©2004 INFORMS 183 for adaptability , we found that reusers assessed not just if the idea could be adapted , but more impor - tantly for them , who ( source , recipient or a third party ) would do the adaptation . During this layer of search , the reuser was often trading off the cost , capabilities , and interests of a source or third party to do the adap - tation against the cost , capabilities , and interests of the solo reuser . For example , in the AFM tip array case , one reusing scientist commented on the value of ﬁnding an adapter : They had an operational system of tip arrays (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) and a fabrication process to make them [ even though it had not been used on Mars or for our purpose ] . This is a huge step forward . We immediately knew that we should team up with [ the adapter ] as it would save time and energy . To assess the credibility , relevance , and adaptabil - ity of the ideas identiﬁed during the scanning step , we found that reusers looked for data , models , proto - types , and other contextual cues ( such as whether the concept had been ﬂown in space previously ) . We refer to these cues as the metaknowledge for the reused idea . Similar to metadata , meaning “data about the data , ” which is used to facilitate retrieval ( Heery 1996 ) , we deﬁne metaknowledge as “knowl - edge about the knowledge , ” which is used to facil - itate evaluation and use ( e . g . , to assess relevance , credibility , or adaptability ) . While types of meta - knowledge such as document author and date ( e . g . , Tiwana 2002 ) were of value to the reusers in the six cases , the types of metaknowledge that were more valuable were physical artifacts such as data , models , and prototypes . Though metaknowledge was used to evaluate ideas , there were too many ideas identiﬁed during the scanning step for metaknowledge to be closely exam - ined for each idea . Therefore , during the brief eval - uation phase , the reusers were primarily interested in determining if the metaknowledge even existed ; they inferred from the existence of the metaknowledge that the idea would be judged positively . For exam - ple , when reusers learned that they could access the data or prototype for an idea , they inferred that the idea was more credible than an idea without data— even before they analyzed the data . When reusers learned that they could ﬁnd someone ( such as a manufacturer ) able to adapt an idea , they judged the idea to be more adaptable than ideas without adapters—even before they spoke with the adapter . When reusers learned that contextual data describing the constraints and environmental conditions under which the original knowledge was generated existed , they inferred that the idea was more reliable . This ﬁnding suggests that reusers do not need or want access to metaknowledge when initially evaluating ideas for reuse ; rather , they only want to be informed that the metaknowledge exists and can be accessed at a later point in time . In the words of one reuser : The key [ at this point in the evaluation process ] was not the availability of the instrument but [ knowing ] the fact that the instrument was in development . Conducting In - Depth Analysis . Finally , ideas that successfully met the three criteria for use ( credibil - ity , relevance , and adaptability ) progressed into the ﬁnal layer of search : in - depth analysis . The goal of this layer was to determine if any of the ideas being considered could in fact be adapted to meet the prob - lem as formulated . In this ﬁnal layer , reusers accessed and manipulated the metaknowledge to test it against the constraints and challenges of the problem . For example , a hand - held commercial ELM for the ELM design case , a software model for the Lidar case , and laboratory prototypes for the AFM design case were acquired and manipulated to provide the necessary conﬁdence for the reuser to commit to the devel - opment approach . During this layer of activity , the reuser often needed to turn to the source and adapter for advice and artifacts . Summary of Three Layers . This pattern of three layers of evaluation suggests that a reusable idea must successfully traverse “gates” to be eventually reused . It must ﬁrst be found on the “scanning radar , ” then it must meet criteria expected during a brief evalua - tion , and ﬁnally it must continue to show promise in a more in - depth analysis . Thus , for knowledge to be reused not one , but three evaluations must take place . Full Development In the ﬁnal stage , the continued ideas were developed and incorporated into a ﬁnal solution . This stage is characterized by the full commitment of the team to the chosen implementation approach . The work now shifts from “Is this feasible ? ” to “Make it happen . ” It is at this point that sharing common experiences between reusers and either the source or adapter becomes valuable . Shared experiences took the form of sessions in which prototypes were tested , reviewed , and improved . In the words of one reuser : We worked with the people at Kennedy Space Cen - ter to design the electrometer experiments on various materials . While working with the data was important , it was equally if not more important to have a lot of discussions and meetings . While shared experiences were important for all six cases , the focus of the shared experience var - ied depending on the degree of innovation : for the least - innovative case , the shared experience focused on transferring best practices , while for the more - innovative cases , the shared experience focused on D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 129 . 128 . 216 . 34 ] on 30 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 10 : 02 .

Moreover , who was involved in these shared experiences varied across the cases . Sources were only included in these shared experiences in four of the cases ; in the other cases , reusers shared experiences with adapters . Discussion In summary , Figure 2 presents a staged KRI process that was discernible across the six reuse cases . This process included six stages : ( 1 ) reconceptualize the problem and approach for innovation , ( 2 ) decide to search for reusable ideas , ( 3 ) scan for reusable ideas , ( 4 ) brieﬂy evaluate reusable ideas , ( 5 ) conduct in - depth analysis on reusable ideas and select one , and ( 6 ) fully develop reused idea . Within each stage , reusers involved in the more - innovative cases behaved differently from those involved in the less - innovative cases . Thus , even though the unique culture of JPL may seem to limit the generalizability of the ﬁndings , radical inno - vation is by its very nature unique ( Leifer et al . 2000 ) . Developing atom - sized computers or biotech - nology innovations require equally unique cultures and individuals . As revelatory cases ( Yin 1984 ) , then , these six cases from JPL provide the opportunity to develop new theory about knowledge reuse for inno - vation that focuses attention on reuse for all radi - cal innovation processes . Therefore , the utility of this research should be judged by the degree to which it fosters new insights and stimulates new ques - tions and propositions for future research ( Eisenhardt 1989 ) . We use these questions and propositions to summarize key points as well as to extend our ﬁnd - ings into new areas .

Our ﬁndings ﬁrst sug - gest a process model for KRI . This model is composed of six stages starting with Reconceptualize the problem and ending with Develop the idea . That is , despite the nonlinear , chaotic nature of radical innovation , a six - stage model was identiﬁable . This suggests our ﬁrst proposition : Proposition 1 . An individual who proceeds through all six stages in the manner described in Figure 2 is more likely to reuse others’ ideas in ways that foster innovation than individuals who skip any stage or perform any stage differently from how it is portrayed in Figure 2 . The uniqueness of the JPL context suggests that testing this proposition is worthy of future study . In addition , we examined only cases in which reuse actually happened , as opposed to cases in which innovation occurred without reuse , or failed to occur because of improper reuse . As such , we cannot con - clude from our ﬁndings that these six stages are both necessary and sufﬁcient for fostering reuse . Future research that makes such comparisons is needed . Three Levels of Search . One of the features of our staged process is the three levels of search : initial scan for possible reusable ideas , brief evaluation , and in - depth analysis . Clearly , such a three - tiered strat - egy beneﬁts innovation by allowing innovators to be exposed to a diverse range of inputs quickly before they converge on a single idea , but it may be inefﬁ - cient if a known point solution is desired , such as with KRR . This raises a proposition for future research : Proposition 2 . Reusers who are interested in knowl - edge reuse for innovation have a greater need to proceed through the three layers of scanning , brief evaluation , and in - depth analysis than reusers interested in replication . Role of Adapters . Our research found that there are three criteria used to decide to reuse knowl - D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 129 . 128 . 216 . 34 ] on 30 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 10 : 02 .

Majchrzak , Cooper , and Neece : Knowledge Reuse for Innovation Management Science 50 ( 2 ) , pp . 174 – 188 , ©2004 INFORMS 185 edge for innovation : relevance , credibility , and adapt - ability . While the ﬁrst two criteria have been found elsewhere ( e . g . , Szulanski 2000 ) , the criterion of adapt - ability has not been mentioned in the literature previously ( although Rice and Rogers suggest , as early as 1980 , that more research attention should be paid to the reinvention process ) . We found that the absence of credible adapters , or the absence of ways to quickly determine if adapters are available and credible , can create a barrier to reuse for inno - vation . This suggests , then , that if an idea is to be reused for innovation , adapters need to be readily identiﬁable . Thus , instead of simply storing an idea in a knowledge repository , names of agents ( which may be manufacturers , institutions , or other researchers ) willing and interested in adapting this idea should be stored as well , or included as part of a discussion forum on the idea . This notion needs further testing and thus we propose : Proposition 3 . An innovator who considers how an idea will be adapted and who will do the adaptation is more likely to reuse ideas to facilitate innovation than reusers who ignore these issues during the reuse process . Role of Metaknowledge . Our ﬁndings that meta - knowledge plays a different role at the different stages in the KRI process is another area for future research . We conﬁrmed previous research that metaknowledge ( describing context , credibility of source , etc . ) about a potentially reusable idea is important to reusers ( Markus 2001 ) . We also conﬁrmed previous research that embodying this metaknowledge in physical arti - facts such as models , data , and prototypes instead of text facilitates understanding and reuse ( e . g . , Star and Griesemer 1989 ) . The additional insight provided by our research is that metaknowledge is accessed differ - ently at different stages in the reuse process . We found that when reusers ﬁrst became aware of an idea they wanted only to know that the metaknowledge on the idea existed . It was only later when reusers conducted in - depth analyses of the idea that they accessed and manipulated this metaknowledge . This suggests that to facilitate knowledge reuse for innovation , the deci - sion about what metaknowledge to capture should be based on which metaknowledge would provide , by its mere presence , some evidence for the credi - bility , relevance , and adaptability of the idea . This is a notion worthy of future research and thus we propose : Proposition 4 . Ideas that are structured to indicate the presence ( or absence ) of metaknowledge will be more readily considered by reusers during the KRI process than ideas that are not so structured . If this ﬁnding that awareness of metaknowl - edge is more important than acquisition at early stages in the knowledge reuse process generalizes to other sites and research studies , this could sug - gest how information overload might be avoided . Reusers can be initially provided with a checklist of what metaknowledge exists on the idea , allow - ing access to the metaknowledge when the reuser returns to the idea for a more detailed analysis . This may also suggest that metaknowledge can be constructed and presented in a way to facilitate or inhibit knowledge reuse . Borrowing from Culnan ( 1983 ) , we call this structuring the “chauffeuring” of knowledge through the reuse process , with meta - knowledge serving as chauffeur . Just as a technology - transfer professional is able to chauffeur an idea from initial awareness to implementation ( Rogers 1983 ) , or Toyota’s knowledge - sharing network is able to chauffeur Toyota suppliers from awareness to adop - tion of best practices ( Dyer and Noveoka 2000 ) , prop - erly constructed metaknowledge might be able to chauffeur an idea through the knowledge reuse pro - cess and increase its chances of being reused . Meta - knowledge , viewed in this way , becomes the “bound - ary object” that links the source to the reuser ( Star and Griesemer 1989 ) . To facilitate reuse , each idea could be coupled with its metaknowledge , organized around evaluation needs , and layered either for mere indication of presence or for access and manipulation . Factors Affecting Reuse . We found many factors that affected KRI , including searching nontraditional communities of practice , use of a variety of search methods , weak ties as well as strong ties , and shared experiences with sources and / or adapters ( but pri - marily only at the end of the process , not at the begin - ning as found by Szulanski 2000 ) . Additional research on these factors is needed to conﬁrm that they are speciﬁc to KRI . We also found that innovators were motivated to consider reusing others’ knowledge only when ( 1 ) they confronted a problem that was insurmount - able with their current knowledge and resources , ( 2 ) they reconceptualized the problem and approach to require an ambitious new perspective , and ( 3 ) they believed that existing ideas were likely to be found somewhere that would be useful . While the effects of the ﬁrst two factors have been found previously ( Gupta and Govindarajan 2000 , Osterloh and Frey 2000 ) , the third factor has important implications for building a theory of KRI . Why one innova - tor believes ideas exist that would be useful , while another believes the opposite , is not clear . It may be , as Allen ( 1977 ) observed , that those who believe there are existing ideas that would be helpful have been exposed , through experience and networking , to a wide range of inputs . Alternatively , as Leifer et al . ( 2001 ) recently observed , these individuals may have been exposed not just to a range of inputs but D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 129 . 128 . 216 . 34 ] on 30 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 10 : 02 . F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Majchrzak , Cooper , and Neece : Knowledge Reuse for Innovation 186 Management Science 50 ( 2 ) , pp . 174 – 188 , ©2004 INFORMS to a particular type of input , an “opportunity rec - ognizer . ” These are individuals who recognize the business potential of an innovator’s idea and who motivate the innovator to pursue his or her ideas , including sharing them with others . These individu - als are different from traditional technology gatekeep - ers or brokers because they are focused on helping sources pursue their own interests . Innovators who make contact with an opportunity recognizer may , in the course of a discussion , learn enough about what various other sources may be doing or what vari - ous business opportunities may exist to increase their belief that an idea useful for their approach is likely to exist . Our ﬁndings suggest that the notion of an opportunity recognizer can be applied to the KRI pro - cess . In this role , the individual helps innovators rec - ognize both that a conceptual approach has validity and that reusable ideas are likely to be found with a reasonable search strategy . This raises a proposition for future research : Proposition 5 . Innovators who are encouraged to pur - sue innovation through reuse by opportunity recognizers are more likely to reuse others’ ideas than innovators with - out that encouragement . Role of Project - Level Decisions . Our ﬁndings sug - gest that the decision to reuse others’ ideas to solve a particular problem needs to be examined with respect to decisions made about other problems in the same project or organizational unit . In our sample , the amount of innovation desired by a reuser for a par - ticular case was constrained in part by the amount of innovation incurred by the entire project . Too much risk in too many areas might damage the viability of the project . For example , in the least - innovative case ( mag patches ) , the reusers intentionally chose to limit the innovativeness of the solution due to the degree of risk already present in other aspects of the project . This suggests that knowledge reuse research should broaden its focus beyond characteristics of the speciﬁc best practices being transferred or the speciﬁc knowledge and participants involved in the transfer process . This broadening of focus should take into account the web of decisions being made by the individual , project colleagues , and project managers . Just as Argote and Ingram ( 2000 ) suggest that the transfer process needs to be understood within an embedded network of elements , our ﬁndings suggest including projectwide decisions into this network , especially for innovation . We phrase this implication as a proposition : Proposition 6 . A key determinant of reuse for inno - vation in any one case will be the degree of innovation incurred in other cases within the same project or organ - izational unit . Reconciling Our Findings with Previous Re - search . We argued at the outset of this paper that Szulanski’s ( 2000 ) model was unlikely to provide a good ﬁt with an innovation environment because the model was more linear in ﬂow , and more determinis - tic about the knowledge being transferred , than is typ - ically experienced in radical innovation . Our ﬁndings support this initial argument by identifying a model quite different from that of Szulanski . There are , however , commonalities between our model and that of Szulanski : they both begin with the recognition of a gap , end with integration of the transferred knowledge into an organizational routine ( or ﬁnalized solution ) , and include characteristics of the recipient as important factors affecting the trans - fer process . Despite these similarities , there are many differences : Szulanski says little about the search and evaluation activities that were so critical to our reusers , and the role of source and recipient are dif - ferent ( in our study , recipient characteristics such as an openness to nontraditional approaches were criti - cal early in our process , and shared experiences with the source were needed at the end , while Szulanski found the opposite to be true ) . The differences between our model and Szulanski’s may be caused by Szulanski’s assumption that meta - knowledge and alternative reusable ideas were gath - ered prior to the decision to transfer , and didn’t model it . We offer an alternative explanation for the differences—and one we ﬁnd more generative of theory building . We suggest that KRI requires more attention to the search and evaluation stages because the idea that is transferred is not committed to until late in the process . It may be that , when integration and innovation are the drivers of the process , the reuse process focuses on how the problem is con - ceptualized and what alternative reusable ideas can be identiﬁed . As such , characteristics of recipients are critical because the recipients deﬁne the level of aspiration ( March and Shapira 1987 ) that motivates them to ﬁnd innovative ways of achieving the desired objective , even if it means not inventing it themselves . In contrast , KRR focuses on the practices being trans - ferred , and thus recipient traits may be less important early on . This suggests that the two models and the two streams of research on knowledge reuse ( for innova - tion and for replication ) can be reconciled by stringing them together into a single model . Our process model can be used to describe early stages of the reuse pro - cess and Szulanski’s model can be used to describe later stages . That is , early in the reuse process when innovation may be desired the reusers devote efforts to problem deﬁnition and search activities . Later in the process when routinization of the selected idea is desired the best practices underlying this idea ( if best D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 129 . 128 . 216 . 34 ] on 30 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 10 : 02 .

Majchrzak , Cooper , and Neece : Knowledge Reuse for Innovation Management Science 50 ( 2 ) , pp . 174 – 188 , ©2004 INFORMS 187 practices exist ) can be transferred by removing as many of Szulanski’s barriers as possible . By stringing the two models together , we may be able to explain the difference in the impact of recipient and source characteristics between the two studies . It may be that the recipient’s and source’s characteristics are inﬂuen - tial at several points in a complete reuse process : early in the innovation phase and later in the routinization phase for the recipient , and the inverse for the source . This suggests that future research should consider the entire lifecycle of the transfer process—from innova - tion to routinization—to understand the process by which transfer occurs . Conclusion In this study , we have offered several research ques - tions and propositions to stimulate future research on KRI . We have suggested that reusers in a KRI pro - cess act differently from those in a KRR process . The unique context of JPL raises a challenge for future research to test the generalizability of these propo - sitions . In the JPL context , the reusers redeﬁned the problem to provide the greatest value to the customer ( scientist and funder ) relative to competitors . We pro - pose that these same drivers exist in most industries ; we would expect to see similar results in other con - texts of radical innovation . We found that reusers in the JPL context balanced the paradox of identifying a nontraditional untested conceptual approach to the problem against the need for risk reduction by pick - ing only those approaches in which they had some conﬁdence that someone , somewhere , would have a relevant idea . We propose that risk reduction is a major factor in most radical innovations and thus would expect to see similar results in future studies . In the JPL context , we found reusers engaging in three levels of search and evaluation that require a broad search of nontraditional communities of practice and the ability to quickly scan metaknowledge . Creativity researchers ( e . g . , Amabile 1996 ) have long argued for the need to search in nontraditional communities ; the use of metaknowledge to do this searching quickly deserves further study . Is the set of metaknowledge we identiﬁed a highly contextualized one ? Finally , we found in the JPL context that reusers sought out adapters ( who were not often the source ) to bridge the gap between a source’s original idea and the ﬁnal solution . Whether this ﬁnding is generalizable is an interesting question . In the JPL context , the reuser and adapter were often not the same person because skills , funding , and experience for the two were quite differ - ent . In other ﬁelds and industries , the two roles may overlap . Is there some characteristic of a discipline that drives adapters’ and reusers’ roles ? In addition to generating research questions for future work in this area , our ﬁndings are also prac - tical . First , due to the importance of being able to use metaknowledge of potentially reusable ideas , such metaknowledge that quickly communicates credibil - ity , relevance , and adaptability needs to be captured and presented . Second , because reusers for innova - tion need to deﬁne problems broadly , be aware of both traditional and nontraditional approaches , con - duct broad and nontraditional searches , and use a variety of search methods , our research suggests that organizations should consider providing training and incentives to their innovators in these areas . Finally , new roles such as adapters , chauffeurs , and opportu - nity recognizers need to become part of the commu - nity of practice encouraging knowledge reuse . In conclusion , this research is intended to ground knowledge transfer and reuse research in a relatively unexplored context : innovation . In this context , as Grant ( 1996 ) so aptly explains , the intention is not spillover , replication , or acquisition , but recombina - tive integration . Knowledge is clearly being reused , but how ? This study is an effort to address this ques - tion and stimulate future research .
