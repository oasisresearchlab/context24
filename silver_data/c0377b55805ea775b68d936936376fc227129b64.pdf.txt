In the unactivated Limulus sperm , a 60 - m m - long bundle of actin ﬁlaments crosslinked by the protein scruin is bent and twisted into a coil around the base of the nucleus . At fertilization , the bundle uncoils and fully extends in ﬁve seconds to support a ﬁnger of membrane known as the acrosomal process . This biological spring is powered by stored elastic energy and does not require the action of motor proteins or actin polymeriza - tion 1 . In a 9 . 5 - A˚ electron cryomicroscopic structure of the extended bundle , we show that twist , tilt and rotation of actin – scruin subunits deviate widely from a ‘standard’ F - actin ﬁlament . This variability in structural organization allows ﬁlaments to pack into a highly ordered and rigid bundle in the extended state and suggests a mechanism for storing and releasing energy between coiled and extended states without disassembly . The actin bundle of the Limulus acrosomal process is an unusual actin - based engine that is highly ordered in its structure 2 . The coiled state has a difference in average twist of 0 . 23 8 per subunit relative to the extended form . Change in the twist accompanies uncoiling of the bundle into the ﬁnal extended state 3 . Mechanical measurements of the extended bundle yield a Young’s modulus ( a measure of stiffness ) of 2 GPa ( refs 4 – 6 ) . This stiffness enables the bundle to penetrate the jelly layer surrounding the egg membrane . A 40 - A˚ tomographic reconstruction 7 revealed periodic and dense packing of the scruin - crosslinked actin ﬁlaments . However , to understand all these functions , a higher resolution structure is necessary . An electron micrograph of the native extended bundle shows its crystallinity ( Fig . 1a ) . We merged data from 153 such bundles at various orientations 8 to produce a three - dimensional map at a resolution of 9 . 5 A˚ ( Fig . 1b ) . As far as we know , this is the highest resolution of any electron cryomicroscopic reconstruction contain - ing an F - actin ﬁlament . We can identify each actin subunit and both domains of scruin , referred to as elongated ( E ) and spheroidal ( S ) on the basis of their shape 9 , and secondary structure elements of both molecules . We used correlation analysis and non - crystallographic symmetry ( NCS ) averaging within the asymmetric unit to determine the azimuthal and axial positions of the 14 actin – scruin subunits . The azimuthal rotation between adjacent subunits ranges from 2 176 . 5 8 to 2 142 . 5 8 ( Fig . 1c , d ) , and thus deviates from the canonical actin helix by 2 10 . 4 8 under - twist to þ 23 . 6 8 over - twist . Nevertheless , the rise per subunit in the axial direction had less than one pixel ( 1 . 33 A˚ ) deviation . This amount of individual azimuthal distortion is larger than the distortions found in averaged reconstructions from F - actin ﬁlaments 10 – 15 , but such studies cannot reveal individual subunit variations . On the basis of this two - dimensional cross - correlation , we created an average actin monomer from the 14 subunits in the asymmetric unit . In this map ( Fig . 2a ) , three a - helices in sub - domain 1 of actin were detected by an a - helix search ( using the program ‘helixhunter’ ) 16 . Their locations match a - helices in the actin crystal structure ( amino acids 79 – 91 , 113 – 125 and 137 – 144 ) 17 . Because we obtained this map without referring to the actin crystal structure during either the reconstruction process 8 or the NCS letters to nature NATURE | VOL 431 | 2 SEPTEMBER 2004 | www . nature . com / nature 104 © 200 4 Nature PublishingGroup averaging , ﬁnding these a - helices in locations expected for an authentic actin molecule ( Supplementary Information ) validated our analysis and the reconstruction . We subsequently aligned and averaged the actin more accurately with a six - dimensional rigid body search of the 14 actin subunits , using the atomic coordinates 18 . In this improved map we were able to identify three additional a - helices ( 182 – 194 , 203 – 216 and 367 – 373 ) ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , the side view ( Fig . 2c ) shows a density near residues 264 – 273 projecting from the back of the subunit . This protrusion corresponds to the hypothesized “hydrophobic plug” that was built in an F - actin model on the basis of ﬁbre diffraction 18 . In all actin X - ray crystal structures the “plug” region has other conformations because the interstrand contacts of an F - actin ﬁla - ment are non - existent in a crystal . In our reconstruction , the plug is positioned to stabilize the two strands of the actin ﬁlament . Finally , we ran the program ‘foldhunter’ again , searching the averaged map ( Fig . 2b , c ) with pairs of subdomains ( subdomains 1 , 2 and 3 , 4 ) . The coordinates derived from this search ( Fig . 2d ) reveal that in the average structure , subdomains 2 and 4 at the top of the molecule are brought 2 – 3 A˚ closer together by a rotation of 3 8 of subdomains 3 and 4 , relative to subdomains 1 and 2 . This ‘closed’ structure is characteristic of nucleotide - bound actin confor - mation 19 – 21 and has been found in actomyosin ﬁlaments 22 . Intrigu - ingly , actin subdomain movement in muscle in response to myosin binding has recently been inferred from ﬂuorescence depolarization experiments 23 . Here it is probably also inﬂuenced by scruin inter - actions . Biochemical evidence shows that ADP is the nucleotide present in the bundle 5 . The orientations determined by the six - dimensional cross - cor - relation search reveal signiﬁcant tilt and rotation of the actin subunits ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary Movie ) . Compared with a standard ﬁlament ( Fig . 3a ) , actin subunits in the bundle ( Fig . 3b ) vary either in tilt ( in and out of the plane of the actin molecule about a horizontal axis ) , which predominantly occurs in the yellow strand in Fig . 3 , or in rotation ( about the centre of the molecule ) , which is more common in the cyan strand . The average deviation from the orientation of the Holmes F - actin model 18 in tilt or rotation was 11 . 3 8 . However , the hydrophobic plug ( Fig . 2c ) can still maintain contact with the opposite strand . Rotation of up to 12 8 was observed in averaged reconstructions of actin with actin depolymerizing factor 14 . Actin’s ability to adopt different conformations by subdomain movements or gross changes of the F - actin helix is well - documented in crystals and in helically averaged ﬁlaments 21 , 24 , 25 . We show how a ‘quasi - helical’ ﬁlament packs into a naturally occurring crystalline bundle . The two - stranded ﬁlament adjusts itself to distortions generated in the biological context of the acrosomal bundle . As predicted 26 , actin has “random variable twist” , in that the azimuth in one subunit has no apparent relationship to that of the preceding or following subunits along the ﬁlament . In the bundle , the twist is Figure 1 Acrosomal bundle reconstruction . a , Image of bundle near a major crystallographiczone . b , Three ﬁlamentsfrom the crystal .

Further - more , the variations ( Fig . 3b ) of the subunits appear to be coordi - nated along a strand , and asymmetric between strands ( that is , one by tilt of its actin subunits , and the other by rotation of its subunits ) . As far as we know , this is the ﬁrst direct evidence for symmetry - breaking between the two strands in an actin ﬁlament . The allowable actin distortion ( Fig . 3b ) affects the interactions and dynamics available to the bundle in its coiled and extended states . Although the scruin atomic coordinates are not yet available , we carried out a two - dimensional search with the scruin domain densities using iterative cross - correlation and NCS averaging , as described above for the actin . Scruin follows a distortion pattern similar to that of actin , with variable azimuth for both the S and E domains of each subunit ( Fig . 1d ) . The averaged map of each domain ( Fig . 4a , b ) shows features that are consistent with a beta - propeller based structure homologous to kelch repeats 27 . Conﬁr - mation of this domain structure requires a higher resolution map . Placing the averaged actin and scruin at the positions determined by the correlation results reveals the relationship among the molecules within an asymmetric unit . This averaged ﬁlament ( Fig . 1c ) shows that each scruin domain interacts with actin subdomains within a ﬁlament at different radii , and perhaps with different functions , as previously observed and suggested 9 , 28 . The interﬁlament contacts are primarily between the S domains of different ﬁlaments ( Supplementary Information ) . This conclusion differs from a much lower resolution ( , 40A ˚ ) reconstruction 7 . To a ﬁrst approximation , the overtwist and undertwist patterns of the actin and scruin in a ﬁlament are similar ( Fig . 1d ) , suggesting that the scruin packing causes the actin distortions . The bundle is both stiff and conformationally variable . The Young’s modulus of the extended bundle 4 – 6 is like that of poly - ethylene or nylon . This stiffness combined with a force of nano - Newton scale provides the pressure to penetrate the jelly coat of the egg . Biochemical evidence suggests that calcium is the switch that changes scruin structure or interactions , and triggers straightening of the bundle 29 . Our model suggests that scruin packing dictates actin ﬁlament structure and the organization of those ﬁlaments into the rigid bundle . Figure 1d shows that the separation between the S and E domains in each scruin molecule varies among different subunits in the asymmetric unit . Thus the S domain interacts in a variable way with the E domain and the actin of its own ﬁlament , and with the S domains from neighbouring ﬁlaments ( Supplementary Infor - mation ) . Suchvariable interactions may be critical for the structures of both coiled and extended forms of the bundle and especially the transition between them . The structure of the extended form of the bundle suggests how the coiled form can store energy . Distortion of actin is balanced against and coupled to the maintenance of interﬁlament scruin contacts in both the coiled and the extended form . We predict that the actin will respond to the changes in scruin during the acrosomal reaction and that transitions must occur along an energetically reasonable path . The acrosomal bundle was proposed to be a biological spring 30 . Our studies have shown that it stores 6 £ 10 2 13 joules of elastic energy . In the coiled state , the subunits are on average over - twisted with respect to the extended state , but under - twisted with respect to standard F - actin . The observed actin distortion ( Fig . 3b ) suggests that scruin - decorated actin ﬁlaments in the bundle can store entropic or enthalpic energy in the actin helix . The extensive interactions between ﬁlaments could both ‘lock - in’ the energy and mediate the transition between coiled and extended conformations . We expect that conformational variability of the actin ﬁlament at the subunit - by - subunit level will be observed in other actin - containing machines , for example the muscle sarco - mere , probably modulated and regulated by other components of the thin ﬁlament such as tropomyosin .
