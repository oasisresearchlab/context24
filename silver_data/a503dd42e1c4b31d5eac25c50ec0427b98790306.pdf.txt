Cortactin Tyrosine Phosphorylation Promotes Its Deacetylation and Inhibits Cell Spreading Eugenia Meiler , Elvira Nieto - Pelegrı´n , Narcisa Martinez - Quiles * Departamento de Microbiologı´a II , Facultad de Farmacia , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , Madrid , Spain Abstract Background : Cortactin is a classical Src kinase substrate that participates in actin cytoskeletal dynamics by activating the Arp2 / 3 complex and interacting with other regulatory proteins , including FAK . Cortactin has various domains that may contribute to the assembly of different protein platforms to achieve process specificity . Though the protein is known to be regulated by post - translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation , how tyrosine phosphorylation regulates cortactin activity is poorly understood . Since the basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation is low , this question must be studied using stimulated cell cultures , which are physiologically relevant but unreliable and difficult to work with . In fact , their unreliability may be the cause of some contradictory findings about the dynamics of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in different processes . Methodology / Principal Findings : In the present study , we try to overcome these problems by using a Functional Interaction Trap ( FIT ) system , which involves cotransfecting cells with a kinase ( Src ) and a target protein ( cortactin ) , both of which are fused to complementary leucine - zipper domains . The FIT system allowed us to control precisely the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and explore its relationship with cortactin acetylation . Conclusions / Significance : Using this system , we provide definitive evidence that a competition exists between acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and that phosphorylation inhibits cell spreading . We confirmed the results from the FIT system by examining endogenous cortactin in different cell types . Furthermore , we demonstrate that cell spreading promotes the association of cortactin and FAK and that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin disrupts this interaction , which may explain how it inhibits cell spreading .

The cortactin protein has emerged as an important node in the network regulating the actin cytoskeleton during numerous biological processes [ 2 , 3 ] . It was originally described as a substrate of Src kinase located primarily at the cell cortex [ 4 ] . Almost simultaneously , cortactin was cloned as the product of the CTTN gene ( formerly EMS1 ) , located in chromosomal region 11q13 , which is frequently amplified in different human carcinomas [ 5 ] . Today , cortactin is considered an oncoprotein and a bona fide invadopodial marker [ 6 ] . Cortactin is a modular protein that contains an N - terminal acidic ( NTA ) domain with a 20 DDW 22 motif that directly binds and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex . The NTA domain is followed by six and a half amino acid ‘repeats’ that bind to F - actin and define the actin - binding region ( ABR ) [ 7 ] . Since cortactin only weakly activates the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro [ 8 ] , it is unclear whether cortactin requires post - translational modifications to be fully active . The ABR is followed by a helical , proline - rich region , followed in turn by a C - terminal Src homology ( SH3 ) domain . Cortactin binds several proteins through its SH3 domain , such as WIP [ 9 ] and neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) [ 10 , 11 ] . Cortactin regulation is very complex [ 12 ] . Although tradition - ally studied as a substrate of Src family kinases ( SFKs ) [ 4 ] , it can also be phosphorylated by other tyrosine kinases such as Fer [ 13 ] and Abl / Arg [ 14 ] . The effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on cortactin structure and function remain largely unknown . This phosphorylation was shown to decrease cortactin binding to F - actin [ 15 ] , and this binding is required for cortactin activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 16 ] . This phosphorylation is also required for inducing bone metastasis of breast cancer cells in nude mice [ 17 ] , and it appears to be involved in bacterial invasion of cells , such as for the adhesion of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) [ 18 ] . Protein phosphatase 1B ( PTB - 1B ) dephosphorylates tyrosine 421 in cortactin [ 19 ] , suggesting reversible regulation . The data seem to indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33662 tightly controlled , but the details of this regulation are far from clear . Tyrosine phosphorylation - dephosphorylation of cortactin may regulate its ability to form complexes with other proteins [ 20 , 21 ] . Cortactin is also the target of serine - threonine kinases , including ERK [ 22 ] and Pak [ 23 , 24 ] . In fact , phosphoproteomic analysis has revealed numerous phosphorylation sites , most of which are serines and threonines [ 25 ] . Cortactin promotes actin polimerization through two pathways : directly , by activating the Arp2 / 3 complex ; and indirectly , when the SH3 domain binds and activates N - WASP [ 10 ] . In vitro , cortactin binds and activates N - WASP only when phosphorylated on serines by ERK , whereas phosphorylation by Src at tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 terminates cortactin activation of N - WASP , which suggests that phosphorylation indeed affects cortactin structure . Based on studies by our group [ 10 ] and others [ 22 ] , we proposed a model in which serine / tyrosine phosphorylation controls the accessibility of the SH3 domain of cortactin [ 10 ] . This model was subsequently named the ‘S - Y Switch’ model [ 26 ] , and its most easily testable prediction is that cortactin can be regulated by a conformational change . The structure of unmodified cortactin [ 27 ] reveals a closed , globular conformation achieved mainly through interactions between the SH3 domain and ABR region . Studies with mutant forms of cortactin have been carried out to understand the functional consequences of serine and tyrosine phosphorylation . Indeed it has been proposed that different cortactin phosphoforms have distinct cellular functions : in this proposal , tyrosine - phosphocortactin mainly regulates focal adhe - sion turnover , whereas serine - phosphocortactin controls actin polimerization [ 28 ] . More recently , antibodies specific for phospho - serine have been used to show that serine phosphoryla - tion of cortactin is essential for lamellipodial persistence [ 29 ] . Adding another layer of complexity to cortactin regulation , studies have shown that the protein is also regulated by reversible acetylation . The protein can be acetylated by histone acetyltrans - ferase p300 / CBP - associated factor ( PCAF ) and deacetylated mainly by Histone Deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) . Acetylated cortactin has a reduced capacity to bind F - actin [ 30 ] . Although numerous studies of cortactin have suggested a complex network of regulatory post - translational modifications , they have been unable to indicate definitively how Src - mediated phosphorylation affects cortactin structure and activity , and how this phosphorylation relates to other post - translational modifica - tions . These difficulties may reflect the low basal level of phospho - tyrosine cortactin in most cell types , which makes cell culture - based studies of cortactin challenging . Here we attempt to overcome this problem using the Functional Interaction Trap ( FIT ) system [ 31 , 32 ] . The FIT system involves fusing a kinase and a substrate of interest to complementary leucine zippers ; cotransfection with the two expression vectors allows for specific and efficient phosphorylation of the substrate . Methods Cells , reagents and antibodies ( Abs ) The following cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) : human epithelial HeLa cells ; mouse fibroblasts deficient in Src , Yes , and Fyn kinase ( Src 2 / 2 , Yes 2 / 2 , Fyn 2 / 2 ; abbreviated SYF ) ; and SYF fibroblasts rescued for Src ( Src + / + , Yes 2 / 2 , Fyn 2 / 2 ; abbreviated Rsrc ) . Wild - type ( WT ) and HDAC6 - deficient MEFs immortalized by p53 gene deletion [ 33 ] were obtained from Dr . Tso - Pang Yao ( Department of Pharma - cology and Cancer Biology , Duke University ) . Cells were grown in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium ( IMDM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and antibiotics . The deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A ( TSA ) from Streptomyces sp was purchased from Sigma . The selective Src - family kinase inhibitor PP2 was purchased from Calbiochem . The following commercial Abs were purchased from Millipore : mouse cortactin 4F11 MoAb ; mouse Src GD11 MoAb ; mouse myc 4A6 MoAb ; Platinum phospho - tyrosine ( for WB ) , which is a mixture of two generic phosphotyrosine Abs : PY20 and 4G10 ; vinculin MoAb ; and FAK 2A7 MoAb ( for IPs ) . For immunopre - cipitations ( IPs ) , we used phosphotyrosine MoAb and for FAK WB , the Ab from Cell Signaling . Mouse actin C4 MoAb was from MP Biomedicals , and rabbit cortactin MoAb was from Novus Biologicals . The rabbit cortactin polyclonal Ab ( Applied Biological Materials ) was raised against an unphosphorylated peptide around tyrosine 466 . This Ab recognizes both unphosphorylated and tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin . Rabbit phosphocortactin Y466 polyclonal Abs were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and from Abcam ( data not shown ) . Myc ( A14 ) Ab was from Santa Cruz . pY421 cortactin Ab was from Abcam . Rabbit Ab against acetyl - cortactin was initially obtained from Dr . Edward Seto ( H . Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute , Tampa , Florida ) and subsequently from Millipore . IRDye 800CW - labeled goat rabbit and mouse secondary Abs ( Fisher Scientific ) were used to give green signal . IRDye 680CW - labeled goat rabbit Ab ( Fisher Scientific ) and Alexa 680 - labeled goat mouse Ab ( Invitrogen ) were used to give red signal . All secondary Abs were purchased at a concentration of 1 mg / ml and used at 1 : 5 , 000 dilution . Constructs All FIT constructs used , including MycCortactin , were a generous donation of Dr . Bruce J . Mayer ( Connecticut Health Center , CT , USA ) . Cortactin with mutations of all three tyrosines that can be phosphorylated by Src ( Y421 / 466 / 482F , referred to as the 3F mutant ) was produced using the QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . Mutations were produced sequen - tially : first the 421F mutant was generated , and then this was used as template to mutate Y466 and Y482 ( primer sequences available upon request ) . After verifying the sequence , the insert was subcloned into an empty ZipB vector . WT GFP - cortactin and 3F - GFP constructs were previously described [ 10 ] . Cell transfection and Western blotting ( WB ) For transfection , plasmid DNAs were purified with endotoxin - free , transfection - grade JetStar 2 . 0 Midi columns ( Genomed ) as per the manufacturer’s instructions . Cell transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) or Fugene HD transfection reagent ( Roche ) . Briefly , cells were grown to 60 – 75 % confluence for Lipofectamine transfections or to 50 – 60 % confluence for Fugene transfections in 6 - well plates using 2 m g of the indicated plasmids per well . Transfections were incubated for approximately 20 h in medium containing 10 % FBS but no antibiotics . WB was carried out on cells from a single well or , when necessary , from a 100 - mm plate . Cells were washed once with cold Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline ( D - PBS ) with calcium and magnesium ( Invitrogen ) and scraped into 300 m l 2 6 Laemmli buffer . Samples were homogenized by three passages through a syringe with a 25 - gauge needle and then centrifuged at 21 , 000 6 g for 5 min at 4 u C . Samples were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Amersham ) using a BioRad transfer system . Membranes were blocked for 1 h with Odyssey blocking buffer and incubated overnight with primary Ab Acetylation versus Phosphorylation of Cortactin PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33662 in blocking buffer containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 . Membranes were washed 4 times for 5 min with PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody , and washed as before . Membranes were scanned with the Odyssey infrared system ( Lycor , Fisher Scientific ) using the red ( 700 nm ) and green ( 800 nm ) channels . When required , membranes were stripped using Odyssey stripping buffer according to the manufacturer’s instructions . When significantly different intensities were observed between the two color signals , we performed sequential Ab incubations . After stripping membranes , we incubated them with secondary Ab alone and scanned them to confirm the efficiency of stripping before incubating them with another primary Ab . Quantification of the bands was performed on the scanned images using the Odyssey Scan band tool . The results were analyzed by the two - tailed Student’s t test and displayed graphically using GraphPad Prism software ( version 5 . 0 ) . Pervanadate treatment Pervanadate solution was prepared by mixing 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 with 1 % H 2 O 2 ( both from Sigma ) , diluting two - fold with IMDM medium and used for 30 min at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 . Immunoprecipitation ( IP ) experiments Cells were grown on 150 - mm plates and transfected as described above with 20 m g of each plasmid . After transfection cells were washed once with D - PBS and scraped into 700 m l modified RIPA buffer [ 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 15 % glycerol , 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 10 mM NaF , 1 mM PMSF , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Amersham ) , phosphatase inhibitor ( PhosSTOP , Roche ) ] . When indicated , TSA was added to the RIPA buffer at a final concentration of 400 ng / ml to detect cortactin acetylation [ 30 ] , except in the case of lysates from WT or HDAC6 - deficient cells . Magnetic mouse or protein G Dynabeads ( 30 m l / IP , Invitrogen ) were washed and blocked with PBS containing 0 . 1 % BSA for 10 min , then incubated 1 h with 4 m g Ab per IP . After one wash with PBS - 0 . 1 % BSA , the beads were added to 200 – 300 m l cell lysate and incubated with rotation at 4 u C for 4 h . The beads were washed 3 times with the help of a magnet ( Invitrogen ) and 200 m l lysis buffer diluted 1 : 10 in PBS supplemented with TSA , except in the case of lysates from WT or HDAC6 - deficient cells , when TSA was omitted . The beads were resuspended in 40 m l 2 6 Laemmli buffer and processed for SDS - PAGE or frozen at 2 80 u C until further analysis . Pull - down ( PD ) experiments GST and the GST - cortactin SH3 domain were produced in BL21 E . coli , purified and coupled to GSH - beads [ 10 ] . The proteins were added to 200 m l cell lysate and incubated for 3 h with tumbling at 4 u C . Pull - downs were washed twice with 200 m l lysis buffer diluted 1 : 10 in PBS . Immunofluorescence microscopy Cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4 % formalin ( Sigma ) and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . After three washes with PBS , cells were blocked with 2 % BSA in PBS for 10 min , stained at room temperature ( RT ) with the appropriate primary Ab for 1 h , washed 3 times with PBS , and finally incubated 1 h with secondary Ab . Actin cytoskeleton was visualized with 1 m g / ml tetramethyl - rhodamine - isothiocyanate ( TRITC ) - phalloidin ( Sigma ) or a 1 : 25 dilution of Alexa Fluor 350 - phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) . The secondary Abs ( Invitrogen ) were Alexa Fluor 405 - labelled mouse ( blue ) , Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled mouse and - rabbit ( green ) , and Alexa 568 - labeled rabbit ( red ) . Counting was done using a Nikon Eclipse TE 200 - U fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu camera . Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop . Confocal micros - copy was performed at the Parque Cientı´fico de Madrid microscopy facility with a Leica Confocal SP2 / DMEIR2 , using Leica software ( version 2 . 61 ) . Spreading experiments Cells were transfected for 20 h , trypsinized and washed once with trypsin inhibitor at 0 . 5 mg / ml ( Sigma ) . For immunofluores - cence studies , 2 . 5 6 10 5 cells per time point were replated on 4 coverslips previously treated with 30 m g / ml fibronectin ( Calbio - chem ) in each well of a 6 - well plate . After fixation they were processed for immunofluorescence . For FAK pull - down and IP experiments , transfections were carried out in 150 - mm plates , and cultures were trypsinized 20 h later . For each condition , 2 . 5 6 10 6 trypsinized cells were kept in suspension or replated on fibronectin - treated 100 - mm plates . Results Efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by Src in cells transfected with the FIT system To specifically phosphorylate cortactin in cells with Src kinase , we used the FIT system ( Fig . 1 , schematic cartoon ) . HA - tagged Src kinase lacking the SH2 and SH3 domains was expressed with a C - terminal leucine zipper from the Leucine - ZipA vector ( ZipAHA - D Src ) , while myc - tagged cortactin was expressed with an N - terminal leucine zipper from the Leucine - ZipB vector ( ZipBMyc - Cortactin ) ( Fig . 1 , lane 5 ) . As controls , we transfected different vector combinations ( Fig . 1A ) and left cells untransfected ( lane 9 ) . We performed these transfections in SYF fibroblasts , which lack the three SFKs ( Src , Yes , Fyn ) predominant for that cell type [ 34 ] . We also performed these transfections in control cells reconstituted with Src ( Rsrc cells ) . WB of cell lysates was carried out using the Odyssey two - color infrared scanning system . Src targets tyrosines 421 , 466 , and 482 of mouse cortactin [ 35 ] . We observed strong tyrosine phosphor - ylation of transfected cortactin using a phospho - specific Ab against tyrosine 466 ( pY466 Ab ) . Simultaneously we detected both endogenous cortactin , migrating at 80 – 85 kDa , and transfected cortactin using the 4F11 mouse MoAb ( Fig . 1A ) . We next merged the images to show that the phosphorylated band superimposes on the transfected cortactin band , and that the mobility of both bands was slightly lower than that of unphosphorylated cortactin . Actin was detected as a loading control . Similar results were obtained with a different cortactin pY466 Ab ( data not shown ) . Using the FIT system , we found no appreciable differences in the levels of cortactin phosphorylation between SYF and Rsrc cells . To analyze how efficiently the FIT system generated phosphor - ylated cortactin , we transfected truncated Src kinase and cortactin without the ZipA or ZipB domains , respectively ( Fig . 1A , lines 4 and 8 ) . The results show that cotransfection of Src and cortactin increases tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin , and that the phosphorylation level is much higher when the leucine zipper domains are used , in agreement with previous studies using the FIT system [ 32 ] . We also analyzed the phosphorylation of position 421 using a pY421 Ab ( Fig . 1B ) . The results in Fig . 1A and 1B indicate that the FIT system allows efficient phosphorylation of cortactin on tyrosines 421 and 466 . In subsequent experiments , we used the pY466 Ab because it gave a stronger signal than the pY421 Ab . Acetylation versus Phosphorylation of Cortactin PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33662 To specifically detect transfected cortactin , we performed WB with mouse myc 4A6 MoAb and rabbit cortactin MoAb . Fig . S1A shows that transfected cortactin is recognized equally well by both Abs . This was further confirmed by the superposition of bands generated with the 4F11 Ab and the rabbit cortactin MoAb ( data not shown ) . These results show that endogenous and transfected ZipBMyc - Cortactin can be detected by either MoAb , though the signal intensity was greater with the rabbit MoAb . As a control for the transfections we blotted with antibodies against the HA tag to detect both HA - D Src ( Fig . S1B , lanes 1 , 4 and 8 ) and ZipAHA - D Src ( lanes 2 and 5 ) . We confirmed the genotype of the SYF and Rsrc cells by blotting with Src MoAb GD11 ( Fig . S1B ) . Substrate specificity of Src kinase in the FIT system To determine whether cortactin is the primary Src substrate phosphorylated in cells transfected with the FIT system , we analyzed the cell lysates by WB using mouse MoAbs against generic phospho - tyrosine ( Platinum Ab : 4G10 + PY20 ) ( Fig . S2 ) . The same membrane was also incubated with rabbit cortactin MoAb . We observed a strong phospho - tyrosine band that comigrated with transfected cortactin ( lane 5 , asterisk ) . When Src kinase is activated , it is phosphorylated on tyrosines , which explains why we observed in lanes 2 and 5 a band of slightly higher molecular weight than actin that corresponds to ZipAHA - D Src . Similarly , we observed Src kinase in the reconstituted Rsrc cells . These results demonstrate that the major phospho - protein in our lysates is transfected ZipBMyc - Cortactin that is tyrosine - phos - phorylated by ZipAHA - D Src ( lane 5 , asterisk ) . As a second control of phosphorylation specificity , we analyzed whether the Src substrate paxillin [ 36 ] is phosphorylated by our transfected Src kinase . We performed WB using a phospho - paxillin ( p - paxillin ) Ab . In Fig . 2A we show the most relevant transfections ( lanes 4 and 5 ) from two FIT experiments ( FIT8 and FIT9 ) , after blotting with p - paxillin Ab . As an internal control , we treated both cell types with pervanadate , a generic phosphatase inhibitor that induced a strong signal for p - paxillin . While untreated cell lysates did not show detectable paxillin phosphor - ylation , lysates of treated cells did . Thus we can conclude that our transfected cells express a basal level of phospho - paxillin . Positional specificity of Src kinase in the FIT system Src phosphorylates tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 in mouse cortactin [ 35 ] . After detecting cortactin phosphorylation at positions 421 and 466 , we wanted to exclude the possibility of phosphorylation at other tyrosines . For this purpose we used a non - phosphorylatable mutant in which the three major residues targeted by Src kinase were replaced by phenylalanine ( 3F ) . We carried out our experiments in HeLa cells because the experiments described above showed similar results in SYF and Rsrc cells , and HeLa cells are easier to handle and widely used . We cotransfected cells with ZipAHA - D Src and either ZipBMyc - Cortactin or ZipBMyc - Cortactin 3F , and performed WB using Abs against generic phospho - tyrosine and cortactin . Cortactin was phosphorylated on tyrosines , while the 3F mutant was not ( Fig . 2B , lanes 4 and 5 ) , indicating that cortactin is phosphorylated specifically on the expected tyrosines . Relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation and acetylation of cortactin Cortactin is acetylated mainly in the cortactin repeat region , and this modification decreases the ability of cortactin to bind F - actin [ 30 ] . Because cortactin phosphorylation by Src has a similar effect [ 15 ] , we wanted to analyze whether a relationship exists between the two post - translational modifications . Figure 1 . Efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by Src in cells using the FIT system . SYF and Rsrc cells were transfected with different combinations of Src and cortactin FIT fusion vectors ( lanes 1 – 8 ) or left untransfected ( lane 9 ) . Cell lysates were blotted for actin as a loading control and with different Abs , then blotted with the respective conjugated secondary antibodies and finally visualized with the Odyssey system . The lysates were blotted with ( A ) pY466 or ( B ) with pY421 cortactin Abs . In both cases , we observed a clear specific phosphorylation band ( in green ) when ZipA - HA - D Src and ZipB - MycCortactin were cotransfected ( transfection 5 ) , and this band superimposes ( asterisks ) on the cortactin band detected with the 4F11 MoAb ( in red ) . Sizes of the molecular weight markers ( denoted M ) are shown in kDa . A schematic cartoon of the FIT system is shown . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0033662 . g001 Acetylation versus Phosphorylation of Cortactin PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33662 For this purpose , we decided to use HeLa cells because cortactin acetylation was previously detected in this cell type [ 30 ] . Cells were transfected with empty vectors ( Fig . 3 , lane 1 ) , with ZipBMyc - Cortactin plus HA empty vector ( lane 2 ) , or with ZipBMyc - Cortactin together with HA - D Src ( lane 3 ) or ZipAHA - D Src ( lane 4 ) . Transfected cells were left untreated or treated with Trichostatin A ( TSA ) , a deacetylase inhibitor previously used to prevent deacetylation of cortactin [ 30 ] . WB experiments were performed to confirm tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin using the pY466 Ab ( Fig . S3A ) . As expected , cortactin was strongly phosphorylated when ZipBMyc - Cortactin was cotransfected with ZipAHA - D Src ( lane 4 ) , and the phosphorylation signal was much lower when ZipBMyc - Cortactin was cotransfected with HA - D Src ( lane 3 ) . To analyze whether phospho - cortactin was simultaneously acetylated , we performed IPs of transfected cortactin using a myc MoAb , followed by WB with an Ab specific for acetyl - cortactin ( Fig . 3A ) . The results show that cortactin was efficiently immunoprecipitated in all samples , while it was undetectable in the isotype control IP ( Fig . 3A , right panels ) . Acetyl - cortactin was nearly undetectable in the sample in which cortactin was strongly phosphorylated ( lane 4 ) , whereas it was clearly detectable when cortactin was not phosphorylated ( lane 2 ) . Treating cells with TSA increased the apparent level of acetyl - cortactin , suggesting that it prevents the deacetylation of cortactin as previously described [ 30 ] . In addition to checking cortactin phosphorylation in the lysates used to perform the IPs ( Fig . S3A ) , we wanted to check the phosphorylation status in the immunoprecipitates ( Fig . 3A ) . The membrane was gently stripped until the green acetyl signal was lost and then reprobed with pY466 Ab and myc MoAb . As expected , the myc immunoprecipitates showed cortactin phosphorylation mainly when ZipAHA - D Src and ZipBMyc - Cortactin were cotrans - fected ( lane 4 ) . When transfected alone , ZipBMyc - Cortactin was not detectably phosphorylated , yet it presented a strong acetylation signal ( Fig . 3A , lane 2 ) . The results suggest that acetylation and phosphorylation of cortactin occur antagonistically . To confirm these results separate IPs were carried out in parallel with myc MoAb and generic phospho - tyrosine MoAb ( pTyr MoAb ) ( Fig . 3B ) . To simplify the experiment we used only TSA - treated cells and the most relevant vector combinations : empty vectors ( lane 1 ) , empty HA - vector and ZypBMyc - Cortactin ( lane 2 ) , and ZipAHA - D Src and ZipBMyc - Cortactin ( lane 3 ) . IP with pTyr MoAb was performed only in the cotransfection of ZipAHA - D Src and ZipBMyc - Cortactin , where cortactin should be phosphorylated . Again , we observed that tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin was not acetylated and vice versa . Thus no signal for acetylation was detected in the phospho - tyrosine IP , which pulled down only tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin . In contrast , a very faint acetylation signal was detected in the myc IP , which pulled down primarily phosphorylated cortactin but also a small fraction of unphosphorylated protein . We found a statistically significant difference in acetylation signal between unphosphorylated cortac - tin ( transfection 2 ) and tyrosine - phosphorylated protein ( transfec - tion 3 ; Fig . 3B ) . To verify these results with tyrosine - phosphocortactin by a different approach we performed IPs with the pY466 cortactin Ab ( Fig . S3B ) using the same vector combinations as above ( Fig . 3B ) . The immunoprecipitates and lysates were blotted with cortactin 4F11 MoAb , which detects both transfected and endogenous cortactin in lysates . Tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin was efficiently immunoprecipitated when ZipAHA - D Src and ZipB - Myc - Cortactin were cotransfected ( lane 3 ) . WB with acetyl - cortactin Ab revealed that pY466 immunoprecipitates did not contain acetylated cortactin , which is consistent with previous results ( Fig . 3A , B ) . These results indicate that the two modifications did not occur simultaneously , suggesting that a competition exists between phosphorylation and acetylation of cortactin . To exclude any non - specific effects due to the fusion tag and to further characterize how these two post - translational modifications relate to each other , we performed transfections using GFP - tagged cortactin constructs ( Fig . 4 ) . We transfected HeLa cells with empty vector and a vector encoding GFP - WT cortactin or GFP - 3F cortactin , and we blotted the lysates with acetyl - cortactin Ab . We observed that WT and GFP - 3F cortactin were acetylated ( Fig . 4A ) and found no statistically significant difference in acetylation level between the two constructs ( data not shown ) . This indicates that Figure 2 . Specificity of tyrosine phosphorylation in the FIT system . ( A ) Detection of the phosphorylation status of paxillin , another Src kinase substrate . SYF and Rsrc cells were transfected with FIT fusion vectors and the most relevant lysates ( 4 and 5 ) from two different experiments ( FIT 8 and 9 ) were analyzed by WB with a rabbit Ab against phospho - paxillin ( in green ) and with a MoAb against actin ( in red ) . As controls , cells were left untreated or treated with pervanadate ( PV ) , a potent phosphatase inhibitor that induces the phosphorylation of paxillin . Rsrc cells showed a higher basal level of phospho - paxillin than did SYF cells , though in both cell lines , this basal level was enhanced by treatment with PV .

Several control cotransfections were done ( lanes 1 – 3 ) . WB with generic pTyr MoAb demonstrated that only ZipB - Myc WT cortactin , and not the 3F mutant , was phosphorylated ( in green ) . Cortactin was detected with a rabbit MoAb ( in red ) .

We next examined the effects of pervanadate ( PV ) and TSA on GFP - cortactin ; these compounds induce phosphorylation and acetylation , respectively ( Fig . 4B ) . Lysates of cells transfected with GFP - cortactin were left untreated or treated with PV or TSA , and subjected to WB with the acetyl - cortactin Ab first , followed by gentle stripping and then reprobing with the pY466 cortactin Ab . As a transfection control , lysates were also blotted with GFP MoAb . Treating lysates with TSA increased the amount of acetyl - cortactin over basal levels . However , we cannot determine whether it simultaneously decreased the level of phospho - cortactin because the basal level of the phospho - protein is undetectable . In contrast , PV strongly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin , and this was accompanied by a decrease in the level of acetyl - cortactin , such that the ratio of the two forms of cortactin differed significantly from basal conditions ( Fig . 4B ) . These results indicate that induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin decreases its acetylation . Analysis of the acetylation and phosphorylation status of endogenous cortactin The experiments described so far established that acetylation and phosphorylation of transfected cortactin are mutually exclusive events . We next analyzed whether the same relationship holds for endogenous cortactin ( Figs . 5 , 6 ) . First we performed experiments in WT and HDAC6 - deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , because HDAC6 is the major cortactin deacetylase in cells [ 30 ] . IPs using 4F11 MoAb were blotted with acetyl - cortactin Ab , then the membranes were stripped and blotted with pY466 Ab ( Fig . 5A ) . IPs from HDAC6 - deficient cell lysates using 4F11 MoAb showed a significantly higher basal level of acetylated cortactin than did IPs from WT cell lysates . In addition , the ratio of the acetyl : pY466 signals was significantly higher in the HDAC6 - deficient cells . These results indicate that the lack of HDAC6 deacetylase significantly increases the acetyl : pY466 cortactin ratio and that HDAC6 - deficient cells are a valuable reagent to characterize how acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin relate to each other . Consequently , we performed cortactin IPs using the acetyl - cortactin Ab and blotted them with pY466 Ab and 4F11 MoAb . No signal was detected by pY466 Ab in the immunoprecipitates in which cortactin was detectable with the 4F11 MoAb ( Fig . 5B ) . To confirm this result , acetyl - cortactin immunoprecipitates were analyzed using generic pTyr mouse MoAb or cortactin rabbit MoAb on separate membranes . Similar results were obtained ( Fig . S4 ) . We confirmed the HDAC6 - deficient phenotype of the MEFs by WB with HDAC6 Ab ( Fig . 5C ) . These results show that Figure 3 . Analysis of acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of transfected cortactin . ( A ) Lysates from various transfection combinations ( lanes 1 – 4 ) , treated or not with the deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A ( TSA ) , were used to perform IPs using a myc MoAb that were examined by WB first with acetyl - cortactin Ab ( in green ) and second with myc MoAb ( in red ) .

We next examined cortactin acetylation in SYF and Rsrc MEFs , because they represent cell types with different levels of tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin ( Fig . 6 ) . Separate IPs were carried out in parallel using 4F11 and pTyr MoAb and blotted first with rabbit acetyl - cortactin Ab . Then the blot was stripped and reprobed with pY466 cortactin Ab . To detect immunoprecipitated cortactin the membrane was stripped again and reprobed with a cortactin Ab ( Fig . 6A ) . We detected acetyl - cortactin in immuno - precipitates prepared from SYF and Rsrc cell lysates using cortactin 4F11 MoAb . Parallel IPs performed with the pTyr MoAb showed that endogenous tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin was present only in Rsrc cell lysates , as expected . Furthermore , this cortactin fraction was not acetylated ( see asterisks , Fig . 6A ) . We quantified three independent experiments and found that 4F11 immunoprecipitates from SYF and Rsrc cells differed significantly in the ratio of acetyl : pY466 cortactin ( Fig . 6A ) . These results indicate that when most of the immunoprecipitated cortactin is tyrosine - phosphorylated , then is not concomitantly acetylated . To confirm these results , we performed IPs from SYF and Rsrc cell lysates with pY466 cortactin Ab ( Fig . 6B ) . The immunopre - cipitates were blotted with acetyl - cortactin Ab and cortactin 4F11 MoAb , gently stripped , and then reprobed with pY466 cortactin antibody ( Fig . 6B ) . As detected in Fig . 6A , tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin was immunoprecipitated only from Rsrc cell lysates . More importantly , cortactin phosphorylated on Y466 was not acetylated ( Fig . 6B ) . Again as detected in Fig . 6A , when cortactin was immunoprecipitated with a generic antibody such as 4F11 MoAb , the immunoprecipitates contained both acetylated and tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin . On the contrary , when cortac - tin was immunoprecipitated with a generic phospho - tyrosine MoAb or a specific pY466 - cortactin Ab , only tyrosine - phosphor - ylated cortactin was immunoprecipitated and it was not acetylated . Together these results demonstrate that the majority of endoge - nous cortactin is acetylated or tyrosine - phosphorylated , consistent with the results obtained with transfected cortactin . Analysis of cortactin acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation during cell spreading We performed FIT transfections of SYF and Rsrc cells to visualize the location of nonphosphorylated cortactin ( transfection 2 ) and phosphorylated protein ( transfection 3 ) . As negative controls , we left cells untransfected and we transfected them with empty vectors ( Fig . S5 and data not shown ) . We visualized cell morphology with TRICT - phalloidin ( Fig . S5 ) . We also examined high - magnification images to study cell morphology in detail . We detected cortactin expression using myc MoAb and cortactin phosphorylation using pY466 Ab . As in the IPs ( Fig . 6 ) , the level of endogenous cortactin that was tyrosine - phosphorylated in SYF cells under our experimental conditions was nearly undetectable ; the level of phosphorylation was similar to that observed in cells transfected only with cortactin ( transfection 2 , TF2 ) . Cotransfec - tion of cortactin and Src kinase in the FIT system ( TF3 ) increased the level of phospho - cortactin in cells , and this level was easier to observe in SYF cells because of their null background level . In SYF cells , cortactin localized to the cell periphery and around the nucleus , as previously described for endogenous cortactin [ 7 ] . In contrast to SYF cells , untransfected Rsrc cells showed , as expected , a detectable level of tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin ( data not shown ) , as did Rsrc cells transfected in the TF2 experiment . Some cells showed clusters of actin and phospho - cortactin ( arrows , Fig . S5 ) . Images from TF3 showed that Rsrc cells were somewhat more retracted and detached than their TF2 counterparts . These results demonstrate that transfected and endogenous tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin show similar local - ization , and suggest a role for phospho - cortactin in cell adhesion . To test this hypothesis , we examined the spreading of transfected SYF and Rsrc cells on fibronectin ( Fig . 7 ) . Fig . 7A shows representative spread and non - spread SYF and Rsrc cells Figure 4 . Analysis of acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of transfected GFP - cortactin . ( A ) Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is not required for acetylation of the protein . HeLa cells were transfected with vectors encoding GFP fused with WT cortactin or the Y421 / 466 / 482F non - phosphorylatable cortactin mutant ( 3F ) . Lysates were blotted with acetyl - cortactin Ab and GFP MoAb . Transfected cortactin was acetylated and no statistically significant difference was found in acetylation level between WT and 3F transfectants ( data not shown ) . ( B ) Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin decreases acetylation of the protein . HeLa cells were transfected with a vector encoding GFP fused with WT cortactin . Transfectants were left untreated ( - ) or treated with pervanadate ( PV ) , a generic phosphatase inhibitor , or with Thrichostatin A ( TSA ) , a deacetylase inhibitor . Lysates were blotted with acetyl - cortactin Ab and with GFP MoAb . After stripping , the membrane was incubated with pY466 cortactin , which was merged with the GFP cortactin signal . The ratio of acetyl : pY466 cortactin is shown for untreated ( - ) and PV - treated cells . a . u . : arbitrary units . * * , p , 0 . 01 . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0033662 . g004 Acetylation versus Phosphorylation of Cortactin PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33662 transfected with ZipB - MycCortactin and empty HA vector ( TF2 ) or ZipB - MycCortactin and ZipAHA - D Src ( TF3 ) . We counted 100 transfected cells and classified then as spread or non - spread for two different time points under three transfection conditions [ TF1 ( empty vectors ) , TF2 ( cortactin ) and TF3 ( tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin ) ] . In TF3 we counted only transfected cells that also showed significant phosphorylation signal . Quantification of the results showed that at 1 h after replating , cells overexpressing cortactin ( TF2 ) showed significantly more cell spreading than did TF1 or TF3 cells . More importantly , expression of tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin ( TF3 ) significantly inhibited cell spread - ing compared to TF1 or cortactin - transfected cells ( TF2 ) . This pattern of spreading was also observed at 3 h after replating . Analysis of cells that did not spread confirmed that cortactin favors spreading , while tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin inhibits it . Indeed , at 6 and 18 h after replating , most Rsrc cells in TF3 were detached ( data not shown ) . Similar results were found in SYF cells , although the differences among the three transfection conditions did not reach statistical significance . These results suggest that cortactin expression favors cell spreading , while cortactin phosphorylation counteracts this effect ( Fig . 7A ) . To further understand the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and explore how it relates to cortactin acetylation during cell spreading , we analyzed the spreading of Rsrc cells on fibronectin in the presence and absence of PP2 , a widely used Src family kinase inhibitor ( Fig . 7B ) . Untreated cells were plated and allowed to spread for 1 and 3 h . Cells on a third plate were allowed to spread for 1 h and then they were cultured for 2 h in the medium containing 10 m M PP2 . Cell lysates were subjected to IPs with cortactin 4F11 MoAb or isotype control Ab . The membranes were first blotted with acetyl - cortactin Ab , the acetyl signal was stripped , and then the membranes were reprobed with pY466 cortactin Ab and 4F11 cortactin MoAb . We observed that PP2 treatment nearly abolished cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( right panel IPs , Fig . 7B ) and increased the intensity of the acetyl - cortactin signal ( left panel IPs ) . Quantification of three indepen - dent experiments showed that treatments with PP2 significantly increased the ratio of acetyl : pY466 cortactin . These results indicate that inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin during cell spreading induces cortactin acetylation . To characterize how cell spreading is altered by tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin , we stained focal adhesions using vinculin as a marker ( Fig . 8 ) . We performed FIT transfections of SYF and Rsrc cells as before and allowed them to spread on FN for 3 hours ( Fig . 8 ) . We visualized focal adhesions by immunoflu - orescence staining with vinculin MoAb and detected expressed protein using myc Ab in cells transfected with empty vectors ( TF1 ) or in cells overexpressing unphosphorylated cortactin ( TF2 ) or tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin ( TF3 ) . We observed that cells overexpressing tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin ( TF3 ) showed markedly fewer focal adhesions than under the TF1 and TF2 conditions , and these differences were more apparent in Rsrc cells ( Fig . 8 ) than in SYF cells . Many cells in TF3 had an elongated morphology , in agreement with previous observations ( Fig . 7 ) . Cell spreading induces the interaction of cortactin with focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , and this interaction is lost upon tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin To understand how tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin may affect the formation of focal adhesions , we focused on a recently described cortactin partner , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) [ 37 ] , which plays important roles in focal adhesion dynamics [ 38 ] . We examined the spreading of HeLa cells on fibronectin , and in parallel left them in suspension as a negative control ( Fig . 9 ) . Since Figure 5 .

( A ) Isotype control ( Ctrl . ) and 4F11 immunoprecipitates from cell lysates of WT and HDAC6 - deficient MEFs ( H ) were blotted first with acetyl - cortactin Ab ( in green ) and second with the 4F11 cortactin MoAb ( in red ) .

We found that cortactin SH3 domain was able to pull down much more FAK from the lysates of spread cells than from lysates of suspended cells . Similar results where obtained with Rsrc lysates ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that focal adhesion formation during cell spreading induces cortactin - FAK association ( Fig . 9B ) . To confirm the cortactin - FAK interaction during cell spreading and to determine whether it is affected by tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of cortactin , we performed IPs from cell lysates overexpressing cortactin ( TF2 ) or tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin ( TF3 ) ( Fig . 9C ) . We immunoprecipitated FAK using a FAK mouse MoAb . The immunoprecitates were blotted sequentially , first with myc Ab and secondly with FAK Ab , and lastly with pY466 cortactin Ab . Interestingly , we observed that FAK immunopre - cipitated cortactin but not tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin ( see asterisk , Fig . 9C ) . This result implies that FAK is associated with cortactin , but not when it is tyrosine - phosphorylated . Discussion Cortactin phosphorylation is predicted to have important physiological consequences [ 26 ] that are not yet fully understood . Although cortactin is a classical Src kinase substrate , the functional consequences of its tyrosine phosphorylation remain unclear . The low basal level of tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin , and poor reproducibility of results when stimulating cell cultures with growth factors such as EGF and PDGF , have made it challenging to understand how tyrosine phosphorylation regulates cortactin activity . To avoid these problems , we used the FIT system to study the effect of Src - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin in cells . In this system , a leucine zipper motif , consisting of a pair of complementary amphipathic helices [ 39 ] , is added to both Src and its substrate , in this case cortactin . Src kinase targets tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 of murine cortactin [ 35 ] . Src family kinases ( SFKs ) are composed of separable modules that include SH2 and SH3 domains [ 34 ] . Different systems have been used to study SFK substrates and signal transduction pathways . The hemopoietic cell Src kinase ( Hck ) was reengineered by substituting the SH2 and SH3 domains with a PDZ domain to alter the kinase’s substrate specificity [ 40 ] . In another study , a temperature - sensitive vSrc mutant was found to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin [ 41 ] . The FIT system has been used successfully to force efficient phosphorylation of desired substrates in cells [ 31 ] , including Src - mediated phosphorylation of paxillin , p130Cas and cortactin [ 32 ] . In the present study , we set up the FIT system and simultaneously detected levels of total cortactin and tyrosine - phosphorylated protein , both transfected and endogenous , using two commercial Abs against phospho - Y466 and the 4F11 MoAb ( Fig . 1A ) . Transfected cortactin was also detected using a rabbit cortactin MoAb and a MoAb to recognize the myc tag on our cortactin constructs . Western blots were visualized with the Odyssey scanning system , which allowed unambiguous double labeling of cortactin and phospho - cortactin . We performed these experiments in SYF and Rsrc fibroblasts to exclude any contribution from endogenous Src kinases . When cells were cotransfected with Src and cortactin , both fused to leucine zipper interaction motifs , we observed a strong phosphorylation signal at positions 421 and 466 that superimposed on the transfected cortactin band ( Fig . 1A , B ) . We next performed various analyses to determine the phosphorylation specificity of our FIT system . We determined that cortactin is the major phosphoprotein in our samples , based on experiments using two generic phospho - tyrosine MoAbs ( Fig . S2 ) . We also showed that our FIT system is specific to cortactin : the transfections did not affect the phosphorylation status of paxillin , a known Src substrate ( Fig . 2A ) . Finally , using the non - phosphorylatable triple cortactin mutant Y421 / 466 / 482F ( 3F ) , we verified that Src - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin occurs at the expected tyrosines ( Fig . 2B ) . Like phosphorylation , acetylation regulates numerous cellular functions . In fact , many proteins related to cytoskeletal dynamics are regulated by acetylation , such as Arp2 / 3 , tubulin , cofilin and coronin [ 42 ] . Cortactin is regulated by reversible acetylation that occurs mainly in the ABR of the protein [ 30 ] , and this acetylation was recently confirmed by ‘‘acetylome’’ analysis [ 42 ] . Acetylation of lysines in the ABR was shown to reduce binding to F - actin , which inhibits cell migration [ 30 ] . Like cortactin acetylation , Src - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin decreases its binding to F - actin [ 15 ] . This binding is required to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 16 ] . We hypothesized that the two modifications are interrelated since they have similar effects on cortactin function , and we explored this idea in the present study . Using the FIT system , we overexpressed phosphor - ylated or unphosphorylated cortactin in cells , immunoprecipitated the protein , and performed WB experiments with Abs against Figure 6 .

To be sure of our results , we performed the IPs using a myc MoAb , and then again using a generic phospho - tyrosine MoAb ( Fig . 3A , B ) and pY466 cortactin Ab ( Fig . S3 ) . The first set of IPs brought down phosphorylated and unphosphorylated cortactin , whereas the second set brought down only phosphorylated cortactin . Blotting with pY466 Ab detected cortactin phosphorylation mainly in the sample transfected with Zip - cortactin and Zip - Src . These experiments show that acetylation and phosphorylation of cortactin are mutually exclusive : acetylated cortactin is not phosphorylated and vice versa ( Fig . 3 ) . Another major finding of our study is that when WT cortactin is expressed in transfected cells , at least some of it is acetylated ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) and therefore predicted to be inactive [ 30 ] . To determine whether the competition observed between acetylation and phosphorylation of transfected cortactin also holds for the endogenous protein , we carried out experiments in two cell types . The first was WT and HDAC6 - deficient MEFs . HDAC6 is the major deacetylase acting on cortactin [ 30 ] . As expected , we found the HDAC6 - deficient cells to have a significantly higher basal level of acetylated cortactin than did WT cells , as previously described using siRNA techniques [ 30 ] . More importantly , we confirmed in both cell types our finding of a competition between acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation . We did this in two types of IP experiments , one using the 4F11 MoAb and the other using an Ab against acetyl - cortactin ( Fig . 5 ) . In the latter IPs , acetyl - cortactin did not show detectable tyrosine phosphorylation , as assessed by either pY466 cortactin Ab or generic pTyr MoAb ( Fig . S4 ) . These two IP experiments were repeated on endogenous cortactin in a second cell type , SYF cells , for which Rsrc cells served as control ( Fig . 6 ) . Since SYF and Rsrc cells have different levels of tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin , we performed IPs with 4F11 , pTyr Ab and pY466 Ab . As in WT and HDAC6 deficient MEFs , endogenous tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin was not acetylated . A major conclusion of our work is that phosphorylation of cortactin has important repercussions on cell spreading , extending the insights of a previous study showing that cortactin mutants mimicking tyrosine phosphorylation affect focal adhesion turnover [ 28 ] . Using the FIT system to control tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin , we analyzed the effect of phosphorylating cortactin on cell location ( Fig . S5 ) and cell spreading ( Fig . 7 ) . We found that phosphorylated and unphosphorylated cortactin expressed through transient transfection has an intracellular distribution similar to that of endogenous protein [ 12 ] . More importantly , phosphorylation affects cell spreading : cortactin expression facilitated cell adhesion , while tyrosine phosphorylation inhibited it . This phenotype was more noticeable in Rsrc cells , which express Src , than in SYF cells , which do not contain the major SFKs expressed in fibroblasts ( Src , Yes and Fyn ) . This difference between the cell lines is understandable given that many proteins besides cortactin participate in cell adhesion , and many of them are regulated by Src - mediated phosphorylation [ 43 ] . In an effort to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin on cell spreading , we hypothesized that this post - translational modifica - tion would affect the binding of cortactin SH3 domain to interacting proteins that function in cell spreading . One obvious candidate was FAK [ 37 ] . Our results in the present study demonstrate that in vivo , as previously proposed in vitro [ 10 ] , tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin prevents the SH3 domain from interacting with FAK and potentially other proteins as well . While we were preparing this manuscript for submission , researchers reported that a tyrosine phosphorylation - mimicking mutant of cortactin no longer binds FAK and promotes cell motility [ 44 ] . This result is comparable to our results obtained with cortactin mutants and with the endogenous protein after Figure 8 . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin affects focal adhesion formation : staining for vinculin . SYF and Rsrc cells were transfected with empty vectors , with ZipB - MycCortactin and empty vector ( TF2 ) or with ZipB - MycCortactin and ZipA - HA D Src ( TF3 ) .

In the present study , we used not mutant forms of cortactin but the phosphorylated form of the WT protein to demonstrate directly that phosphorylation inhibits cortactin binding to FAK and cell spreading . Our results point to a significant role for tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in regulating cell adhesion to fibronectin . This further suggests the possibility that cortactin and its phosphorylation contribute to integrin signaling . Model We propose a model for the ‘sequential’ activation of cortactin ( Fig . 10 ) . The major tyrosines targeted by Src are located in the proline - rich region at the C - terminus of the protein . Cortactin has a closed , globular conformation , achieved mainly through interactions among the SH3 domain , the ABR and helical region [ 27 ] . This agrees with previous studies showing that in unmodified cortactin , the SH3 domain is masked [ 10 , 22 ] . Since acetylated cortactin has also been proposed to be inactive [ 30 ] , we hypothesize that acetylated cortactin has a closed conformation as well . Based on our observation that acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation are not present simultaneously , we propose that in acetylated cortactin , the tyrosines targeted by Src are hidden . Analysis of the tertiary structure of cortactin suggests that both acetyl and phosphate groups can be close to each other in space [ 45 ] , which may explain why one process excludes the other . Acetylation of the e - amino group of lysines has already been suggested to ‘‘rival’’ phosphorylation in some cases [ 46 ] . Some examples of phosphorylation - acetylation switches in the regulation of proteins are already known . For example , Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 1 ( STAT1 ) is activated by phosphorylation and inactivated by acetylation [ 47 ] . We further propose that upon appropriate stimulation , such as focal adhesion formation during cell spreading , cortactin is deacetylated , mainly by HDAC6 , which like cortactin can translocate to the cell periphery [ 48 ] . This deacetylated status would be maintained by rapid Src - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation , although we cannot exclude the possibility that other post - translational modifications contribute to inhibiting reacetylation . In essence , we propose that tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin is a ‘pre - activation state’ . At the present moment we do not know whether this species has an open or closed configuration ; this will require high - resolution structural analysis . Figure 9 . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin terminates its interaction with focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) during cell spreading . ( A ) Coomassie staining of purified GST and GST - cortactin SH3 domain was scanned in the Odyssey system . ( B ) HeLa cells were detached with trypsin - EDTA , washed with trypsin inhibitor and kept in suspension ( susp . ) or allowed to spread for 3 h on fibronectin ( FN ) - treated 100 - mm plates . RIPA cell lysates were used for pull - down experiments with GST or GST - SH3 , which were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and WB with focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) Ab , followed by labeling with a 800CW - conjugated goat rabbit Ab . ( C ) HeLa cells were transfected with ZipB - MycCortactin and empty vector ( TF2 ) or with ZipB - MycCortactin and ZipA - HA D Src ( TF3 ) . After 20 h cells were detached with trypsin - EDTA , washed with trypsin inhibitor and allowed to spread on FN - coated 100 - mm plates for 3 h . Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with FAK MoAb . The immunoprecipitates were subjected to WB and probed in three steps : ( 1 ) with myc Ab to detect transfected cortactin , followed by a 680CW - labeled goat mouseAb ( red ) ; ( 2 ) with FAK Ab , followed by a 800CW - labeled goat rabbit Ab ( green ) ; and ( 3 ) with pY466 cortactin Ab , followed by a 800CW - labeled goat rabbit Ab . Transfected cortactin was immunoprecipitated by FAK ( asterisk ) only when the protein was not tyrosine - phosphorylated . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0033662 . g009 Acetylation versus Phosphorylation of Cortactin PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 12 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33662 Supporting Information Figure S1 Western - blotting controls for the transfec - tions of the FIT vectors . ( A ) To detect our transfected protein , lysates were analyzed by WB with a rabbit cortactin MoAb and a mouse myc MoAb . Both MoAbs recognize transfected cortactin . ( B ) Transfection and cell phenotype controls were performed by WB with HA Ab ( in green ) , and myc and Src MoAbs ( in red ) . ( TIF ) Figure S2 Specificity of the FIT system as detected with phosphotyrosine generic antibodies . SYF and Rsrc cells were transfected with different combinations of Src and cortactin FIT fusion vectors ( lanes 1 – 8 ) or left untransfected ( lane 9 ) . The cell lysates were blotted for actin as a loading control , and with a mixture of two generic phosphotyrosine MoAbs : 4G10 and PY20 ( Platinum ) . The major tyrosine - phosphorylated band observed in our lysates corresponded to cortactin detected with rabbit cortactin MoAb ( in red ) in the lysates cotransfected with ZipA - HA - D Src and ZipB - MycCortactin ( lane 5 , asterisks ) . ( TIF ) Figure S3 Analysis of acetylation and tyrosine phos - phorylation of transfected cortactin . ( A ) Lysates from various transfection combinations ( lanes 1 – 4 ) , treated or not with the deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A ( TSA ) , were blotted using pY466 cortactin Ab ( pY466 ) ( in green ) and 4F11 MoAb ( in red ) to analyze the phosphorylation of transfected cortactin . ( B ) TSA - treated cell lysates from various transfection combinations ( lanes 1 – 3 ) were subjected to IP experiments with the pY466 Ab or isotype control Ab ( Ctrl . ) . The IPs were blotted first with acetyl - cortactin Ab , and second with the cortactin 4F11 MoAb ; then the membrane was stripped and reprobed with pY466 Ab and with cortactin 4F11 MoAb . The asterisk denotes nonspecific bands . ( TIF ) Figure S4 Analysis of acetylation and tyrosine phos - phorylation of endogenous cortactin in WT and HDAC6 - deficient MEFs . Immunoprecipitates obtained with acetyl - cortactin Ab were blotted with phospho - tyrosine generic mouse MoAb ( pTyr ) and cortactin rabbit MoAb . There was not phosphorylation signal to coincide with acetylated cortactin . ( TIF ) Figure S5 Localization of tyrosine - phosphorylated cor - tactin . SYF and Rsrc cells were transfected with empty vectors ( not shown ) , with ZipB - MycCortactin and empty vector ( TF2 ) or with ZipB - MycCortactin and ZipA - HA D Src ( TF3 ) . Cells were fixed and visualized by immunofluorescence using myc MoAb ( in blue ) , pY466 cortactin Ab ( in green ) and TRITC - phalloidin to label actin cytoskeleton ( in red ) . Pictures were taken on a confocal microscope at 600 6 magnification . Images were merged and a zoomed view was generated using Leica software . Scale bars are shown . Some cells showed clusters of actin and phospho - cortactin ( arrows ) . ( TIF ) Acknowledgments We are indebted to Dr . Bruce J .

Acetylated cortactin is inac - tive and probably has a closed conformation that masks the tyrosines targeted by Src . Upon appropriate stimulation , cortactin is deacetylated by HDAC6 , exposing the tyrosines , which are then rapidly phosphor - ylated by Src . This phosphorylation keeps cortactin deacetylated . Whether this tyrosine - phosphorylated cortactin has an open or closed configuration is unknown ( question mark ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0033662 . g010 Acetylation versus Phosphorylation of Cortactin PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 13 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33662 12 .
