We use this ‘FociQuant’ tool to compare methods of kinetochore quantitation and we show proof of principle that FociQuant can be used to identify changes in kinetochore protein levels in a mutant that affects kinetochore function . This analysis can be applied to any protein that forms discrete foci in cells . Keywords : kinetochore , fluorescence , yeast , cerevisiae , ImageJ INTRODUCTION The advent of genome - wide green fluorescence protein ( GFP ) labeling has enabled the location of most cellular proteins to be determined in vivo [ 1 ] . This type of study has revealed that , for a number of cellular processes , proteins colocalize to discrete foci either as part of their nor - mal homeostasis or in response to specific stimuli [ 2 , 3 ] . For example , DNA repair proteins relocalize to discrete foci that are coincident with double strand breaks [ 4 ] . The study of these foci provides insight into the underlying biological processes ( for example see [ 5 ] ) . Kinetochores are specialized protein complexes that assemble on centromeres to direct the segregation of chromosomes during cell division [ 6 - 8 ] . Defects in kinetochore function result in errors in chro - mosome segregation , which lead to aneuploidy and genome instability , a hallmark of cancer cells [ 9 - 12 ] . Hence , altered levels of kinetochore proteins may disrupt normal chromosome segregation and play a role in tumorigenesis or tumor development . In support of this notion , over - expression of several kinetochore and checkpoint genes has been found in tumor cells [ 13 - 16 ] . For this reason , and to understand the basic structure of the kinetochore , a key question is to understand the assembly and homeostasis of kinetochores . However , assessing the levels of proteins that are specifically located at the centromere is relatively difficult . The total cellular protein levels are not indicative of the protein loaded onto the centromere ( i . e . part of the kinetochore ) , hence standard biochemical techniques are not necessarily informative . This question has been addressed in the yeast Sacharomyces cerevisiae by quantitatively assessing kinetochore protein levels using fluores - cence imaging [ 17 - 20 ] . An advantage of budding yeast is that all 16 centromeres cluster together to a single focus within the yeast nucleus that approximates to a diffraction - limited spot . Hence , measuring the fluorescence intensity of these foci allows quantitative assessment of kinetochore protein levels . One of the next steps in understanding kinetochore biology is to understand how the levels of the kinetochore proteins change in response to perturbations such as mutations , over - expression of endogenous genes or drug treatments . This requires a high - throughput method of assessing kinetochore protein levels using fluorescence imaging . We have developed a modular script , ‘FociQuant’ , written for the freely available ImageJ software that enables quanti - tation of the fluorescence intensity of kinetochore foci ( or any other fluorescent foci ) . The script could be used for images of single cells , but it is designed to be used for high - throughput imaging approaches . We use FociQuant to compare established 2 - dimensional and 3 - dimen - sional quantitation methods and show that under normal conditions the reported approaches give well - correlated results . We also show that the data generated using FociQuant compares well with that obtained using commercial software . We assess the ability of FociQuant to detect changes in kinetochore protein levels between haploid and diploid cells and also those produced by a checkpoint mutant . We find that changes 2 J Biol Methods | 2015 | Vol . 2 ( 2 ) | e22 POL Scientific in the fluorescence intensity of foci of yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) linked to kinetochore protein Dad4 in mad1∆ cells are detected using FociQuant . These data suggest that changes in kinetochore homeostasis can be used to identify mutants that lead to chromosomal instability . The software could be used to quantify other types of foci , such as those formed by centrosome proteins and we show proof of principle for simultaneously quantifying two different foci in the same images . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains used here are based either upon W303 ADE2 + RAD5 + genetic background [ 21 , 22 ] or for MIF2 - GFP the BY4741 strain [ 23 ] grown using standard methods [ 24 ] . A fluorescently - tagged strain , T37 , was generated via homologous recombination of a linear PCR product , to create endogenously tagged DAD4 - YFP ( MAT a can1 : : STE2pr - Sp _ his5 lyp1∆ : : STE3pr - LEU2 DAD4 - YFP : : NATMX SPC42 - RFP : : HYGMX ) and this was used to derive PT146 - 1A ( MATα TRP1 lys2∆ DAD4 - YF - P : : NATMX SPC42 - RFP : : HYGMX ) . The homozygous diploid DAD4 - YFP / DAD4 - YFP strain , PT206 , is a cross between T37 and PT146 - 1A . The heterozygous diploid strain PT207 contains only one tagged allele of DAD4 ( MAT a / α trp1 - 1 / TRP1 lys2∆ / LYS2 can1 : : STE2pr - Sp _ his5 / can1 - 100 lyp1∆ : : STE3pr - LEU2 / LYP1 DAD4 / DAD4 - YFP : : NATMX SPC42 - RFP : : HYGMX / SPC42 ) . The deletion of MAD1 was introduced by amplifying the KANMX cassette from the mad1 : : KANMX strain from the gene deletion library [ 25 ] and transforming this into T37 ( genotype as T37 but with mad1∆ : : KANMX ) . For imaging Mtw1 - YFP , haploid E66 ( MATα TRP1 lys2∆ MTW1 - YFP ) and diploid PT6 ( MAT a / α trp1 - 1 / TRP1 lys2∆ / LYS2 BAR1 / bar1 : : LEU2 MTW1 - YFP / MTW1 - YFP ) strains were used . The MIF2 - GFP strain is from the GFP collection of strains [ 1 ] ( MAT a his3∆1 leu2∆0 met15∆0 ura3∆0 MIF2 - GFP : : HIS3MX ) . We confirmed the sequence of modified loci using PCR and Sanger sequencing . Yeast were prepared for imaging by growth in synthetic complete media at 23˚C ( containing 120 mg / L adenine to minimize the con - centration of the autofluorescent adenine biosynthetic intermediate phosphoribosylamino - imidazole ) . Log - phase cells were mixed with low melting point agarose to 0 . 7 % and placed on a glass microscope slide beneath a 22 mm square ~ 170 µm thick coverslip and imaged within 10 minutes . The depth of agarose between the slide and coverslip is fixed at 6 - 8 µm , slightly larger than the diameter of the average yeast cell , which maintains a consistent distance from the coverslip to the cell nucleus . Cells were imaged with a Zeiss Axioimager Z2 microscope ( Carl Zeiss AG , Germany ) , using a 63 × 1 . 4 NA plan apochromat oil immersion lens . Zeiss Immersol 518F immersion oil was used with a refractive index of 1 . 5181 . Fluorescence illumination was provided by a Zeiss Colibri LED illumination system ( a 505 nm LED was used for YFP excitation , 470 nm was used for GFP illumination and 590 nm used for RFP illumination ) . Fluorescence emission passed through filter sets from Zeiss ( 60HE for YFP and RFP and 38HE for GFP ) . Brightfield contrast was enhanced with differential interference contrast ( DIC ) prisms . The resulting light was captured using a Hamamatsu Flash 4 . 0 Lte CMOS camera with 6 . 5 µm pixels , binned 2 × 2 ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Japan ) . The exposure times were set to ensure that pixels were not saturated , typically 200 msec . The resulting 16 - bit images have a pixel size of 206 nm in x and y and a z step size of 350 nm . Images shown in the figures were prepared using Volocity imaging software ( Perkin Elmer Inc . , USA ) or ImageJ [ 26 ] . Figure 1 . Outline of image analysis protocol . A .

The flow chart illustrates the steps taken by the ImageJ script to quantify foci , each box indicates a separate module in the software . RESULTS A key requirement of quantifying fluorescent images is that the imaging system produces a linear relationship between the number of photons emitted from the sample and the voltage readout ; often from a shift register ( CCD ) or active - pixel ( CMOS ) sensor . This relationship can be determined experimentally for any system and it is a prerequisite J Biol Methods | 2015 | Vol . 2 ( 2 ) | e22 3 POL Scientific of quantitative imaging . Space does not permit a full discussion of ap - propriate imaging systems , but this information is available elsewhere [ 27 ] . Specifically for kinetochore imaging , there are excellent resources for obtaining appropriate images that avoid many of the confounding issues associated with quantifying fluorescence [ 17 ] and the system used here is described further in the Materials and Methods . Images are typically either single channel ( 1 color , for example Fig . 1A ) or multichannel ( for example Fig . 6D ) and contain a stack of images ( a z stack ) where each z slice is in a different plane of focus . As proof of principle we chose to use the kinetochore protein Dad4 , a component of the microtubule - associated outer kinetochore DAM1 / DASH com - plex [ 28 ] . We tagged this protein with YFP by fusing the endogenous DAD4 gene to that encoding YFP . We wished to create a simple system of image quantitation that was robust and had the potential to be used with many images as part of a high - throughput approach . A number of commercial software and data analysis packages are available to enable quantitation , but we wished to develop an open access system that would use freely available software . To increase the flexibility of the system we also wanted to create a modular system that could in - corporate additional features . We have made use of the popular ImageJ software , which is widely adopted and freely available [ 26 ] , and we have developed a modular script ( illustrated in Fig . 1B ) that quantifies the fluorescence intensity of foci from 3 dimensional ( 3D ) images . The script is divided into several simple modular algorithms and a detailed description of each module is provided in the supplementary informa - tion . A number of the modules are interchangeable to allow different parameters to be used in selecting foci or for including the quantitation of another channel of fluorescence emission . The script , including the individual modules is freely available to download ( https : / / sourceforge . net / projects / fociquantitation / files / ) . Segmentation A typical kinetochore focus ( Fig . 2A ) is assumed to be a diffraction limited point source , although in reality the individual kinetochores are spaced in a region ≤ 200 nm [ 29 ] . In any case , the bulk of the fluores - cence emission is contained within an x - y area consistent with the point spread function of the optical system ( ~ 550 nm for our system ) . Using a wide field imaging system the resolution in the z dimension is less precise and consequently the foci appear elongated in this dimension ( Fig . 2B ) . A first step in quantifying these foci is to identify their x , y and z position in an image such as Figure 1A . There are a number of methods for identifying bright points in both 2 - dimensional ( 2D ) and 3D images ( for example with CellProfiler [ 30 ] or FindFoci [ 31 ] ) . The method by which foci are identified has implications for the subsequent quantitation of the fluorescence signals . Cells growing asynchronously or mixed populations of cells may have foci that are fundamentally different in their fluorescence intensity . Kinetochore intensity increases during S phase as the centromeres are replicated and then decreases as the two sister kinetochores separate during mitosis . Furthermore , different mutants may have foci of different intensities or differing shapes . Therefore , our ImageJ script incorporates one of three different segmentation modules that allow foci to be selected in different ways . In each case the output is a set of points in each image that align in two dimensions ( x and y ) with each focus . A fully automated approach allows the user to set a specific noise threshold for the ‘FindMaxima’ process in ImageJ and then uses this to get a selection of points for each image . The advantage of this method is that it can be applied to multiple images without any manual intervention and consequently is suitable for high - throughput analysis . Automated segmentation is also Figure 2 . Quantitation of fluorescence foci . A . A typical kinetochore focus is shown in 2 dimensions , the scale bar is 5 µm . B . The focus has a third dimension in z that is extended due to the optical imaging system . The solid scale bar in x and y dimensions and dashed scale bar in z are all 5 µm . C . 2D quantitation measures a defined square of pixels ( yellow 3 × 3 in this case ) with a background region ( blue ) two pixels outside of the measured region . D . 3D quantitation measures the brightest z slice plus the z slices directly above and below this plane , although the background measurement remains a single z slice in the brightest plane . E . The graphical output from the software includes an image with all the measured objects indicated ( a small region is shown here ) . The measured and background regions are indicated together with an identifying number , which can be used to track this particular object to specific measurements in the tabulated output ( e . g . Table S1 ) . The measured kinetochore and background regions have the dimensions illustrated in ( C ) . unbiased , since there is no user input . However , this type of segmen - tation suffers from a lack of precision , since there is no guarantee that only genuine kinetochore foci are selected . While it is possible to filter some aberrant measurements out of the resulting data using quantitative parameters , we wanted to create alternative selection methods . Therefore the second method allows the user to select the threshold manually for each image . This has the advantage that each focus does not need to be selected separately , instead the threshold is adjusted manually to an appropriate level that is optimum for each image . This semi - automat - ed method would be ideal if the overall fluorescence intensity is very different between images , but consistent within an image . The third method allows the user to manually select each focus in each image . While this method is time consuming , it can reduce false positives if the user is readily able to select the correct foci in the image and can be applied to a subgroup of cells within a field of view . When using the manual selection method , the selected points do not need to exactly align with the center of the focus , since the quantitation module will then search locally for the brightest point ( the size of this search area can be defined within the module ) . This manual segmentation is ideal if only specific cells within an image need to be quantified . The choice 4 J Biol Methods | 2015 | Vol . 2 ( 2 ) | e22 POL Scientific of which segmentation method to employ should be determined either by the requirement to select only specific foci ( the manual method ) or the need to select all foci ( the semi - automated / automated method ) . Quantitation The primary aim of the FociQuant quantitation is to measure the intensity of the fluorescence and this is achieved in three ways , each of which is based upon common methods used in the literature . First , a square area around each focus ( typically ~ 600 nm ) is used as the x - y area for quantitation , sufficient to account for the majority of the fluorescence from kinetochores [ 18 ] . This area can be adjusted based upon the pixel size of the image ( in our images each pixel is 206 nm square , consequently we used a 3 × 3 pixel square , Fig . 2C ) . Since each image is composed of a stack of vertically separated images ( z stack ) , the script next identifies the brightest z slice within the z stack . Assuming that this brightest square is not at the very top or bottom of the z stack , the mean intensity of the brightest square is then recorded . This square does have depth , determined by the depth of field of the Figure 3 . Comparing different types of fluorescence measurements . A . The 3D box measurement is com - pared with the 2D measurement for 4981 Dad4 - YFP foci , the measurements correlate well . B . The 3D and 2D measurements also correlate for each image as a whole . The average kinetochore focus intensity for each of the 55 images are compared using the two methods . In both panel A and B , then mean intensi - ties are shown rather than integrated intensities . C . The distribution of the 2D measurements is shown indicating a relatively broad distribution of intensities from the 4981 foci ( with a mean intensity of 469 r . u ) . The distribution of 3D measurements ( dashed line ) is very similar to that for the 2D measurements . All foci were selected using the fully automated method . All fluorescence measurements are expressed in relative units ( r . u . ) . D . Different exposure times for Mif2 - GFP images are shown with identical contrast , the scale bar is 5 µm . E . The false discovery rates were estimated from the Mif2 - GFP images assuming that cells would contain either one or two foci . False positives indicate the automated detection of extra ‘non - kinetochore’ foci and false negatives indicate a failure to detect genuine kinetochore foci . J Biol Methods | 2015 | Vol . 2 ( 2 ) | e22 5 POL Scientific objective lens and so is technically cuboid . For imaging diffraction limited foci , the numerical aperture of the lens is typically high , hence the depth of field is primarily determined by wave optics and will differ depending upon wavelength ; our imaging system has a depth of field of 400 - 500 nm . Importantly , the z slice position of this square is also recorded , since the relative distance from the coverslip can have significant effects upon the measured fluorescence [ 17 ] . Selecting a 3D ‘volume’ that encloses all fluorescence above a given threshold is common in a number of commercial imaging software packages . Therefore , a second measurement is made by including the adjacent squares immediate above and below the brightest square ( Fig . 2D ) . This 3D box ( for example 3 × 3 × 3 pixels ) defines a volume that depends upon the spacing of the separate z stacks in the user’s image and the depth of field of the objective lens . Finally , the mean fluorescence of the square in every slice in the z stack is also calculated ( as in [ 32 ] ) . It is important to subtract the fluorescence background from mea - surements of fluorescence in an image . In an ideal imaging system , the levels of background fluorescence are uniform across the field of view . However , since this ideal situation rarely applies and different cells may have different levels of background fluorescence , we chose to measure a local background measurement for each focus . We use an area that is two pixels outside of the brightest square and is two pixels wide ( Fig . 2C and D ) . In addition , we also measure this same back - ground area in the entire z stack , although we realise that , depending upon the z spacing , the fluorescence from a focus would contaminate this volume due to the point spread function in the z dimension . In summary , the ImageJ script makes three measurements of each focus and two background measurements . Each measurement is a mean value of the grey levels within each area or volume . Median measurements of both the brightest square and the background area are taken . Also , the integrated fluorescence from the 3D measurement is also calcu - lated . The output of our script includes an image that indicates these foci and background regions in 2 dimensions ( Fig . 2E ) . The tabulated results describe a number of details about each measurement . Each kinetochore measurement includes the mean and median values of the 2D measurement , the mean of the 3D measurement ( box , as in Fig . 2D ) and the mean of the whole stack . An example of the data output is shown in Table S1 . The background region measurement for each focus includes the mean and median of the 2D measurement and the mean of the whole stack . Hence , with four different measures of kinetochore intensity and three measures of background intensity , there are twelve possible background - subtracted values that can be calculated for each focus . Here we use two different calculations of background - subtracted kinetochore foci intensity . First , the median background intensity is subtracted from the mean kinetochore intensity ( both 2D ) , referred to as the 2D measurement . We use median background values rather than mean in case the background region overlaps neighboring foci , which would skew the mean . Second , for 3D measurements we use the ‘box mean’ of the kinetochore with the median 2D background subtracted . We have included a module in FociQuant that plots both , the center of mass of each focus , and the position of the peak of a Gaussian distribution ; this positional information is included in the results table ( e . g . see Table S1 ) . This results table can be filtered in a number of ways , for example to eliminate dead cells , which would have a very high background fluorescence or to only select foci in one region of the image using the X , Y and Z coordinates . Figure 4 . Comparing foci segmentation methods . A . The mean fluores - cence intensities of kinetochores in each image are compared when using a fully automated segmentation ( x axis ) or semi - automated segmentation ( y axis ) . Measurements are all made in 2D . B . The same comparison is made between fully automated segmentation ( x axis ) or manual segmentation ( y axis ) . C . The distribution of foci fluorescence intensities is shown for automated segmentation of foci ( blue , as in Fig . 3C ) and manual selection of foci ( red ) . The manual selection of foci avoids some of the weak foci that are sometimes found in wild - type cells . D . Two examples of these weak foci are highlighted with red arrowheads and shown in the graphical output of the ImageJ script . Black arrowheads indicate standard kinetochore foci . Scale bars are 5 µm and the ( background subtracted , 2D ) intensities of the highlighted foci are indicated . Comparing 2D and 3D measurements We compared the 2D , 3D and stack quantitation methods for a set of 55 sample images of a yeast strain ( T37 ) in which the kinetochore is labeled with Dad4 - YFP encoded at the genomic locus . Images were acquired as described in the Materials and Methods . An example of one of these images is shown in Figure 1A . We initially used FociQuant’s automated segmentation approach to find the foci . In total 4981 foci were identified and quantified . We compared the 2D with 3D box quantitation and find that the methods are very well correlated ( Fig . 3A ) . Our images contain 21 vertically - separated z planes spread over 7 µm and so are not ideal for whole stack measurements . However , we find good correlation between the whole stack and 2D measurements ( Fig . S1A and B ) . The correlation between the different methods also extends to the mean intensities of foci from each of the 55 images ( Fig . 6 J Biol Methods | 2015 | Vol . 2 ( 2 ) | e22 POL Scientific 3B ) . These data show that for relative quantitation of foci fluorescence , the 2D and 3D methods give equivalent data . The distribution of the foci intensities from the 2D and 3D quantitation are found to be sim - ilar ( Fig . 3C ) . Members of the DAM1 / DASH complex are relatively abundant kinetochore proteins [ 18 ] , which makes the segmentation straightforward . To assess the ability of the methodology to measure weak foci , we quantified the fluorescence of Mif2 , a lower abundance kinetochore protein . We find that Mif2 - GFP foci are clearly visible with our normal imaging conditions using 200 msec exposure time ( Fig . 3D ) , so we reduced the exposure time gradually to diminish the signal to noise ratio . We find that at < 50 msec exposure , FociQuant cannot readily identify the foci ( Fig . 3E ) . These data confirm our expectation that foci quantitation , particularly using an automated approach , relies upon a sufficiently strong emission signal from the tagged protein , relative to the background noise in the image . We next wished to ask whether the different segmentation methods would affect the average fluorescence intensities in these images . We used both the semi - automated and manual selection methods to quantify the fluorescence of foci in all of the 55 Dad4 - YFP images and compared the results with those from the automated selection . The semi - automated method correlates well with the fully - automated method ( Fig . 4A ) . The manual foci selection process should be the most precise since only genuine kinetochore foci are selected , however , it suffers from subjec - tivity , as the user may be biased to select only stereotypical kinetochore foci . Indeed we find only moderate correlation between the manual and automated methods ( Fig . 4B ) . We noticed in the distributions of fluorescence intensities that a peak of low intensity foci was absent from the manual segmentation method ( Fig . 4C ) . This class of foci have fluorescence that is less than half that of the normal kinetochores and examples of these weak foci are highlighted in Figure 4D . These foci may indicate lagging chromosomes or other aberrant kinetochore structures within a subset of wild - type cells . The fluorescence intensity of kinetochore foci in unsynchronized cells ( such as Fig . 1A ) will contain kinetochore foci with a single complement of centromeres ( 1C ) and a double complement ( 2C ) . 2C kinetochores arise after DNA replication in late S phase and early G2 phase . This would result in some S / G2 kinetochores with higher fluorescence [ 29 ] . The distribution of fluorescent intensities across the population of 4981 foci is relatively broad ( Fig . 3C ) with no obvious indication of two groups of foci ( G1 vs G2 ) . To assess the contribution of 2C kinetochores to the distribution of fluorescence intensity values , we used the manual selection method to quantify only separated metaphase kinetochores , which have a 1C DNA content . An example of these metaphase kine - tochore is shown in Figure 5A , inset . The metaphase kinetochores do indeed produce a less variant fluorescence intensity ( Fig . 5A ) . Calibrating FociQuant software To compare how the ImageJ script would compare with a com - mercial image analysis package we used Volocity software ( Perkin Elmer ) to quantify fluorescence in a set of images and compared the values with that obtained using our automated script . The details of the Volocity segmentation are provided in the supplementary information . Since the Volocity measurements are 3D , we compared them with our 3D measurements using FociQuant . We find that the two methods do correlate ( R 2 = 0 . 67 ) for Dad4 - YFP quantitation ( Fig . S1C ) , but the correlation is less than we might have expected . This may be in part because all the images are of the same tagged protein ( Dad4 - YFP ) in wild - type cells . Thus the differences between the images are relatively small and therefore more susceptible to small changes in quantitation . To more reliably assess the ability of FociQuant to detect changes in the intensity of fluorescent foci , we compared both haploid and diploid cells with labeled kinetochore proteins . Since diploid cells have twice as many centromeres as haploids they can be expected to load twice the amount of kinetochore proteins . We used the automated method to assess both Mtw1 and Dad4 kinetochore protein levels in haploids and diploids and we used our automated FociQuant method . For Mtw1 - YFP strains , we find ~ 70 % increase in fluorescence from haploids to diploids ( Fig . 5B and Fig . S1D ) . However , when we examined Dad4 - YFP images we find that the fluorescence is only 40 % higher in diploids than haploids ( Fig . 5C ) . The same results were obtained using Volocity image analysis software ( Fig . S1E and F ) . Additionally , a heterozygous diploid DAD4 - YFP / DAD4 strain contains less Dad4 - YFP signal than a haploid ( Fig . 5C ) . These latter data suggests either that Dad4 - YFP does not compete effectively with untagged Dad4 for inclusion into the kinetochore or that the DAD4 - YFP allele produces less Dad4 protein than the untagged allele . One possible reason the Dad4 - YFP diploids do not have foci that are twice as bright as haploids may be that the automated segmentation method is less able to detect Dad4 - YFP foci than Mtw1 - YFP foci . To test this notion we manually selected Dad4 - YFP foci in both haploids and diploids , but again the diploid cells only have 40 % more Dad4 kinetochore fluorescence of haploids ( Fig . S1G ) The implications of these data are discussed later , but in summary the FociQuant software can detect the different levels of fluorescence between haploid and diploid cells . A key concern with quantitative fluorescence imaging is the effect of fluorophore bleaching . If a significant proportion of the tagged protein is bleached , then the measurement of fluorescence will underestimate the true levels of fluorophores present in each focus . The rate of bleaching depends upon the fluorophore and its environment and is proportional to the excitation energy . Bleaching is a particular problem in confocal imaging , which uses high - energy excitation . The FociQuant software allows us to measure bleaching by quantifying fluorescence levels in cells that have been continuously exposed to excitation energy . Rapid bleaching can result in different z slices having different intensities due to progressive bleaching during the image acquisition . We imaged both Dad4 - YFP and Mif2 - GFP with continuous exposure to LED excitation for approximately 9 minutes , with a z stack of images captured every 12 seconds ( each z stack takes approximately 3 seconds to capture ) . Individual foci were quantified for each time point using the automated segmentation method . The resulting bleaching curves show different rates of bleaching for these two proteins ( Fig . 5D ) . Hence , FociQuant can be used to assess bleaching rates for specific tagged proteins that form foci . In this case , the effect of bleaching should be small within the 3 second acquisition time used for the images shown . mad1∆ mutants The purpose of our FociQuant software is to enable high - throughput analysis . To test the ability of FociQuant to detect mutations that impact the kinetochore , we chose to look at mutants in the mitotic checkpoint gene MAD1 . Mad1 binds to kinetochores in response to phosphorylation of Bub1 and aids the conversion of Mad2 from an ‘open’ to a ‘closed’ form , which is a key step in checkpoint activation [ 33 , 34 ] . Mutants of MAD1 have an abrogated checkpoint and therefore may proceed through mitosis without all their chromosomes correctly attached to the mitotic spindle . This leads to a chromosomal instability phenotype [ 35 , 36 ] . We captured images of both wild - type and mad1∆ cells containing Dad4 - YFP and used the automated analysis method to compare the fluorescence intensity of their kinetochore foci . We find that mad1∆ J Biol Methods | 2015 | Vol . 2 ( 2 ) | e22 7 POL Scientific cells have a broader distribution of kinetochore fluorescence intensities than wild type ( Fig . 6A ) , consistent with the aberrant kinetochore foci that are observed in many cells ( Fig . 6B ) . Overall we detect an increase in the mean kinetochore fluorescence in mad1∆ cells ( Fig . 6C ) . Thus , our methodology readily detects the changes produced by checkpoint mutations , and could therefore be used to identify similar changes produced by other genetic changes that would lead to a chromosomal instability phenotype . 2 channel analysis Since the software is modular it is possible to build in the ability to analyze a second fluorescence channel . To demonstrate this we have used such a “2 channel” analysis of cells tagged with both Dad4 - YFP and Spc42 - RFP . Spc42 is a spindle pole body protein and hence marks the microtubule organizing center in yeast . We include a proximity threshold , that the user defines , to search within a defined number of pixels of the primary focus for a focus in the second channel . Hence , only RFP foci within a set number of pixels of the YFP focus will be analyzed . The second channel is quantified as for the first channel and the positions of the second channel foci are marked on the graphical output ( Fig . 6D ) . An example of the typical tabulated output is shown in Table S2 . The scripts for 2 color imaging are also freely available to download ( https : / / sourceforge . net / projects / fociquantitation / files / ) . Figure 5 . A .

The metaphase kinetochores have a narrower distribution ( mean = 509 r . u . , n = 480 , standard deviation = 153 r . u . ) compared with all foci ( mean = 605 r . u . , n = 4087 , standard deviation = 269 r . u . ) . The inset image shows a stereotypical metaphase pair of kinetochores , the scale bar is 5 µm . B . The mean fluorescence intensity of Mtw1 - YFP foci in both haploids and diploids is shown for FociQuant automated analysis , the error bars indicate one standard deviation . C . The mean fluorescence intensity of Dad4 - YFP foci in both haploids and diploids is shown for FociQuant automated analysis , the error bars indicate one standard deviation . D . The foci fluorescence of six Mif2 - GFP foci and six Dad4 - YFP foci are shown over time with continual fluorescence exci - tation ; the fluorescence data are normalized to the starting fluorescence measurement , which is set to the value 1 . The error bars indicate one standard deviation . The foci were identified using the automated segmentation protocol and at later time points some foci are not detected hence the absence of error bars on some time points . 8 J Biol Methods | 2015 | Vol . 2 ( 2 ) | e22 POL Scientific DISCUSSION We have developed a software tool , FociQuant , that enables high - throughput quantitative analysis of the fluorescence levels of foci in cells . The software is freely available and runs on the popular ImageJ platform . The modular nature of FociQuant and extensive line - by - line documentation allow the script to be modified with new functions or new image formats as required . The software provides various outputs of quantitation including both 2D and 3D analysis with a number of background correction possibilities . The tabulated results data can be mined to extract , for example , dead cells that have a high fluorescence background or to enrich for metaphase cells . We use this methodology to compare different methods of foci quantitation and show that they correlate well with each other . We also compare FociQuant with a com - mercial software package for fluorescence quantitation and find good correlation between the methods . The aim of FociQuant is to enable high - throughput analysis of images of kinetochore foci to identify per - turbations that affect kinetochore protein levels . Initially , we compared haploid and diploid strains encoding the kinetochore proteins Mtw1 - YFP and Dad4 - YFP . FociQuant and Volocity software consistently detect a ~ 70 % increase in fluorescence intensity of diploid Mtw1 - YFP kineto - chore foci , compared with haploid strains . However , Dad4 - YFP shows a more modest increase in fluorescence ( ~ 40 % ) . There are a number of possible reasons for this . First , it is possible that the addition of the YFP tag to Dad4 causes a perturbation in the structure of the kineto - chore , although we do not see any obvious mitotic growth defects in DAD4 - YFP strains . The observation that heterozygous diploids appear to selectively exclude Dad4 - YFP from the kinetochore may support the Figure 6 . The fluorescence intensity of kineto - chores in mad1∆ cells and 2 colour analysis . A . The distribution of foci fluorescence intensities of a new set of wild - type images ( blue ) are compared with those of mad1∆ cells ( red ) . All measurements are automated 2D analysis . B . Examples of mad1∆ cells with normal ( top ) or aberrant ( middle and bottom ) kinetochore foci are shown , scale bar is 5 µm . C . The average kinetochore intensity of mad1∆ cells is higher than wild type ( Students t - test P < 0 . 0001 ) , the error bars indicate standard deviation of the mean . D . An example of 2 - colour measurement is shown for Dad4 - YFP , Spc42 - RFP . The position of the centre of the second channel measurement is indicated on the graphical output with a yellow box . The scale bar is 5 µm , the tabulated quantitation of these two yellow and two red foci are shown in Table S2 . J Biol Methods | 2015 | Vol . 2 ( 2 ) | e22 9 POL Scientific idea that the tagged protein is not equivalent to an untagged version . We note that Dad4 - YFP fluorescence shows a considerable variation between cells ( Fig . 5A ) ; the coefficient of variation of automatically selected haploid foci fluorescence is 0 . 49 compared with 0 . 32 for Mtw1 . The high Dad4 - YFP variance may be a result of the fluorescent tag . Second , there may be rapid turnover of kinetochore bound Dad4 - YFP , especially in diploids , and coupled with slow fluorophore maturation , the fluorescence signal may no longer correlate with protein numbers . However , experiments with structural kinetochore proteins do not support the notion of rapid turnover [ 18 , 29 , 37 ] . Although , these data could be interpreted to indicate that Dad4 is not loaded stoichiometrically with the rest of the DAM1 / DASH complex in diploid cells , this seems an unlikely option . Previous studies with DAM1 / DASH proteins show that they work together as part of heterodecameric complex [ 38 ] , although with some flexibility as to their stoichiometry [ 18 ] . The DAM1 / DASH proteins are thought to form a ring around microtubules [ 38 , 39 ] and they are essential . Consequently we would expect the members of the DAM1 / DASH complex to scale with the other kinetochore proteins . Finally , it is possible that a proportion of the Dad4 - YFP in the cell has the YFP moiety improperly folded , resulting in a pool of non - fluorescent Dad4 - YFP . This notion could explain the high degree of cell to cell variation in fluorescence intensity seen with Dad4 - YFP . We show that our methodology is sufficient to identify changes in kinetochore fluorescence produced by a mutation in the checkpoint gene MAD1 . Checkpoint mutants proceed through mitosis even if chromosomes are not correctly attached to the mitotic spindle . The automated analysis of the kinetochore fluorescence of mad1∆ cells indicated a large range of fluorescence intensities from very weak foci to highly - fluorescent foci . This observation indicates altered Dad4 protein levels , which may be the result of chromosomal instability or checkpoint dysfunction that are characteristic of mad1∆ cells [ 35 , 36 ] . This analysis shows that the software can detect changes in kinetochore fluorescence in mutants that affect chromosome segregation using the fluorescence intensities or distribution of intensities ( Fig . 6 ) . It should be pointed out that our cell cultures were not synchronized to a specific point in the cell cycle . Since kinetochore fluorescence increases as cells replicate their centromeres in S phase , late S / G2 cells would be expect - ed to have higher levels of fluorescence at kinetochores . Additionally , cells in early mitosis may start to separate their kinetochores but by a distance that is less than the diffraction limit , in which case two foci would be quantified as one . Thus the cell cycle stage of cultures could influence the foci fluorescence . Since FociQuant is modular and flexible it can be adapted to differ - ent types of cellular foci and provides different types of fluorescence measurements . For example , a second channel can be measured to compare the levels and location of a second kinetochore or spindle protein within the same cells , as indicated in Figure 6D . We have built a software module to plot the position of foci at a resolution beyond the diffraction limit ( using Gaussian fitting of diffraction limited spots ) , the software could determine the spatial separation of two cellular proteins in high - throughput data . Alternatively , the script could be adapted to identify different shapes such as lines consistent with microtubules . The software could also be used to screen for split GFP association or potentially for FRET studies both of which have been useful for studying the yeast kinetochore [ 40 , 41 ] . Consequently , the methodology outlined here provides a robust tool for relative quantitation of fluorescence signals from large numbers of foci and has the potential to be used in numerous applications beyond simple quantitation .
