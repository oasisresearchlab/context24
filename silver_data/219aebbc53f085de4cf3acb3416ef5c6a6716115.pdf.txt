ARTICLE Received 4 Nov 2012 | Accepted 16 Apr 2013 | Published 21 May 2013 Formin mDia1 senses and generates mechanical forces on actin ﬁlaments Antoine Je´gou 1 , Marie - France Carlier 1 & Guillaume Romet - Lemonne 1 Cytoskeleton assembly is instrumental in the regulation of biological functions by physical forces . In a number of key cellular processes , actin ﬁlaments elongated by formins such as mDia are subject to mechanical tension , yet how mechanical forces modulate the assembly of actin ﬁlaments is an open question . Here , using the viscous drag of a microﬂuidic ﬂow , we apply calibrated piconewton pulling forces to individual actin ﬁlaments that are being elongated at their barbed end by surface - anchored mDia1 proteins . We show that mDia1 is mechanosensitive and that the elongation rate of ﬁlaments is increased up to two - fold by the application of a pulling force . We also show that mDia1 is able to track a depolymerizing barbed end in spite of an opposing pulling force , which means that mDia1 can efﬁciently put actin ﬁlaments under mechanical tension . Our ﬁndings suggest that formin function in cells is tightly coupled to the mechanical activity of other machineries .

P hysical forces participate in the regulation of biological functions , from embryonic development to adult physiology , and are key factors in numerous pathological processes 1 . Individual cells are sensitive to their mechanical environment , which can be used to steer stem cell differentiation 2 . Single - molecule approaches have provided insight into some molecular mechanisms responsible for the conversion of physical forces into biochemical signals . For example , talin , a protein involved in mechano - transduction at focal adhesions , exposes buried vinculin interaction sites when it is stretched by forces of tens of piconewtons 3 . Molecular motors that convert the energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical movement along ﬁlament tracks are also sensitive to applied forces in the piconewton range , and have been studied with extreme accuracy 4 , 5 . In stark contrast , nearly nothing is known about the regulation of cytoskeletal ﬁlament assembly by mechanical forces , besides the slowing down of polymerization by an opposing obstacle—an effect observed more clearly for microtubules 6 than actin ﬁlaments 7 , which are too ﬂexible to work individually . Evidence of a mechanism where a mechanical force modulates the elongation of individual actin ﬁlaments is still missing . Formins elongate actin ﬁlaments while remaining processively attached to their growing barbed ends 8 , 9 . They are responsible for the rapid generation of long actin cables which form the backbone of key cellular substructures such as ﬁlopodia 10 , stress ﬁbres 11 and cytokinetic rings 12 , 13 . Formin elongation has been proposed to be mechano - sensitive 14 , as the two protomers of the FH2 ( Formin Homology domain 2 ) dimer translocate in a rotating stair - step fashion to track the elongating barbed end 15 , 16 . From a physiological perspective , the regulation of formin activity by mechanical forces would have a central role in numerous situations where formin - elongated ﬁlaments are eventually put under tension , for example , during ﬁlopodia retraction or cytokinetic ring contraction . The aim of the present work is to establish how a formin responds to the application of mechanical tension on the ﬁlament that it is elongating . We use microﬂuidics to apply piconewton pulling forces to individual actin ﬁlaments elongated by surface - anchored formin mDia1 , and show that their elongation rate can thus be increased up to two - fold . This increase in elongation rate can be understood by considering that the pulling force favours the ‘open’ conformation of the FH2 dimer , in which an additional actin subunit can be added at the ﬁlament barbed end . The mechanical response of formin mDia1 is the same whether the pulling force is applied at the N - terminal side of the FH1 domain or at the C - terminal side of the FH2 domain . We also show that formin mDia1 remains processively bound to the barbed end of a depolymerizing ﬁlament which is being pulled on , and that the pulling force slows down depolymerization . This result implies that formins can put actin ﬁlaments under tension . Results Applying forces to individual ﬁlaments with microﬂuidics . In order to apply pulling forces to individual ﬁlaments , we have taken advantage of a yet unexploited mechanical feature of our recently developed microﬂuidics setup 17 , 18 . In this experimental conﬁguration , ﬁlaments grow anchored by one end to the glass coverslip surface at the bottom of a ﬂow chamber . The ﬁlaments are aligned and maintained close to the coverslip surface by the ﬂow ( Fig . 1b ) . The viscous drag exerted by the ﬂowing liquid on the anchored ﬁlament results in a pulling force , which is maximal at the anchoring point . Using a bead in an optical trap to measure this force , we have veriﬁed that it was proportional to the local ﬂuid velocity times the length of the ﬁlament , and thereby determined the longitudinal friction coefﬁcient for an actin ﬁlament ( Fig . 1a , Methods ) . Filaments anchored at the bottom of the ﬂow cell are in a region where the ﬂow velocity increases linearly with distance away from the surface ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . As the anchored ﬁlament ﬂuctuates in the ﬂowing ﬂuid , it explores different distances away from the surface . Using Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy with a calibrated penetration depth ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) we have measured the contour proﬁle of individual ﬁlaments , which ﬂuctuate around an average position 250 nm above the surface for the range of ﬂow velocities and ﬁlament lengths used in this work ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . The force exerted on the anchoring point is computed by integrating the viscous drag over the whole - ﬁlament contour , which experiences different local ﬂow velocities as it explores different distances above the surface . Within a 10 % error , the average force is equal to the viscous drag the ﬁlament would experience if it remained entirely 250 nm above the surface . The force ﬂuctuates within ± 30 % of its average value , at a frequency far superior to that of data acquisition ( Fig . 1b , Supplementary Fig . S3 , Methods ) . When a ﬁlament grows from a surface - anchored spectrin - actin seed , no signiﬁcant force is exerted on a formin interacting with its freely growing barbed end ( Fig . 2a ) . In this situation , as in the absence of formin 17 , the ﬂow velocity has no impact on the elongation rate . Here , we elongate ﬁlaments from surface - anchored formins on which we thus exert a pulling force . We have used a formin construct mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) , which comprises the functional FH1 and FH2 domains , as well as the DAD domain which has no impact on ﬁlament elongation 19 , an N - terminal GST tag and a C - terminal His tag ( Fig . 2 ) . Proper passivation of the coverslip surface and functionalization with streptavidin ensured the speciﬁc anchoring of either the N - ter - FH1 or the C - ter - FH2 domain of mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) pre - incubated with biotinylated anti - GST or anti - His antibodies ( Fig . 2 ) , without affecting their activity ( Methods ) . As ﬂuorescent labelling can give rise to unexpected artifacts 20 , we monitor the elongation of ﬁlaments from unlabelled actin monomers , by ﬁrst nucleating and Actin filament 12 10 8 6 4 F o r c e ( p N ) 2 0 Filament length × flow velocity ( μ m 2 s – 1 ) 0 5 , 000 10 , 000 15 , 000 20 , 000 Optical trap Flow Force Glass slide Actin filament mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) Flow 150 nm 350 nm 5 – 50 μ m 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 N u m be r o f e v en t s 10 0 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 62 2 . 4 2 . 8 3 . 2 3 . 64 Force ( pN ) Figure 1 | Pulling on actin ﬁlaments with the viscous drag of a ﬂowing ﬂuid .

Elongation is monitored by tracking the position of the ﬂuorescent ﬁlament segment as it moves away from the anchored mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) . Pulling forces accelerate elongation by formin mDia1 . At a given ﬂow rate , the force exerted on the anchored mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) increases progressively as the ﬁlament elongates , and the elongation rate increases with this force ( Fig . 3 ) . The pulling force can also be varied rapidly by changing the ﬂow rate . The relation between force and elongation rate does not depend on the method by which the force is varied , and the elongation rate drops upon a decrease of the pulling force ( Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . Forces hence modulate formin activity in a reversible fashion . To understand what causes this increase in elongation rate upon the application of a pulling force , we have measured this effect at different proﬁlin – actin concentrations ( Fig . 3c ) . Pulling forces increase the elongation rate to a plateau value that is roughly twice the value in the absence of force , with a half - effect reached for a force of B 0 . 6 pN . The same behaviour is observed whether mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) is anchored via anti - His antibodies , thereby pulling on the FH2 domain alone , or via anti - GST anti - bodies , thereby pulling on the FH1 domain as well ( Figs 2a , 3c ) . The pulling force exerted on the FH2 dimer should favour its translocation 14 . The linear increase of elongation rate with proﬁlin – actin concentration in the absence of force ( Fig . 3c inset ) indicates that the translocation of the FH2 dimer is not rate - limiting and that we can consider the FH2 dimer to be in rapid equilibrium between a ‘closed’ conformation , in which no subunit can be added , and an ‘open’ conformation , in which subunits can be added with rate constant k on to the barbed end 15 , 21 ( Fig . 4 ) . The elongation rate can be written as v elong ¼ p 0 k on ( C (cid:2) C c ) , where C is the proﬁlin – actin concentration , C c is the critical concentration and p 0 is the probability to ﬁnd the FH2 dimer in the open conformation . Based on a simple description of translocation using transition state theory 22 , 23 , we can write that upon application of a pulling force F , the probability p 0 becomes p F ð Þ ¼ 1 1 þ 1 (cid:2) p 0 p 0 e (cid:2) F d = kT ð 1 Þ where d ¼ 5 . 4 nm is the actin monomer size , k is Boltzmann’s constant and T is temperature . The elongation rate can hence be written as v elong F ð Þ ¼ k on ð C (cid:2) C c Þ 1 þ 1 (cid:2) p 0 p 0 e (cid:2) F d = kT ð 2 Þ Fits of our data by this simple model , with p 0 and k on ( C (cid:2) C c ) as free parameters for each curve , are shown in Fig . 3c . We can hence interpret our results by considering that a pulling force accelerates ﬁlament elongation by favouring the open conformation of the FH2 dimer . In the conditions of our measurements ( that is , with a 3 m M excess of proﬁlin ) , we ﬁnd k on ¼ 84 . 8 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and C c ¼ 0 . 07 m M ( Fig . 3c , inset ) . In the absence of force , the FH2 dimer is in the open conformation only 56 % of the time ( p 0 ¼ 0 . 56 ± 0 . 06 ) , resulting in a slower elongation , with an ‘apparent on - rate’ of 48 . 1 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 . Formin mDia1 generates tension on depolymerizing ﬁlaments . Recent work on individual actin ﬁlaments has shown that mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) is able to track a depolymerizing barbed end 16 . Using our control conﬁguration , where no force is applied to mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) , we conﬁrm this observation . We have previously reported that free barbed ends depolymerize faster in the presence of proﬁlin 17 and we now show that this effect is further ampliﬁed by the presence of mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) at the barbed end ( Fig . 5b ) . This effect is reminiscent of the acceleration of barbed end elongation from proﬁlin – actin by formins . Future experiments should reveal whether this effect is due to the action of FH1 alone or also involves an alteration of the barbed end by the FH2 dimer . The fact that a formin can track a depolymerizing barbed end suggests that it could perhaps generate pulling forces on the disassembling ﬁlament . To address this question , we have triggered the depolymerization of ﬁlaments under mechanical force in our microﬂuidic setup , by ﬂowing in a solution of proﬁlin . We observe that mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) remains bound to the depolymerizing ﬁlament , pulling it upstream against piconewton forces , thus showing that formins are able to generate mechanical forces ( Fig . 5 ) . This activity was observed on ﬁlaments elongated from ATP - actin and depolymerized in standard F - buffer ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) as well as ﬁlaments elongated from ADP - actin and depolymerized in ATP - free buffer ( Fig . 5 ) . To further characterize the mechanical response of mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) as a force - generating motor , we have measured the depolymerization rate of ADP - actin ﬁlaments against different loads ( Fig . 5 ) . We ﬁnd that a pulling force exerted on the ﬁlaments slows down depolymerization . As for elongation experiments ( Fig . 3 ) , we have veriﬁed that this effect is reversible , and that the depolymerization rates measured against a mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) 6xHis FH2 FH1 DAD GST Anti - His Anti - GST UnlabelledG - actin LabelledF - actin segment Flow Flow Force Force T i m e 10 μ m FH1 FH2 CONTROL Spectrin - actin No force Force Flow Figure 2 | Applying forces to surface - anchored formins as they elongate actin ﬁlaments .

Following a similar reasoning as for elongation , we can assume that the terminal actin subunit can depart from the barbed end , with a rate constant k off , only when the FH2 dimer is in the ‘closed’ conformation ( Fig . 4 ) . The depolymerization rate can then be written as v depol F ð Þ ¼ k off 1 þ p 0 1 (cid:2) p 0 e F d = kT ð 3 Þ Fits of our data by this simple model , with p 0 ¼ 0 . 56 ( determined by the ﬁts of the elongation data by equation ( 2 ) ) , d ¼ 5 . 4 nm , and leaving k off as a free parameter for each curve , are shown in Fig . 5 . As for elongation , the interpretation here is that the pulling force favours the ‘open’ conformation of the FH2 dimer . This simple two - state model accounts for the observed force - induced decrease of the depolymerization rate , but misses some of its features . For instance , our data indicate that the force - depolymerization proﬁle becomes less sensitive to proﬁlin concentration as force increases , more drastically than what is computed theoretically , suggesting that the interaction of proﬁlin with the formin - bound barbed end may also be affected by force . Also , the computed depolymerization rates are nearly zero at 3 pN , whereas the experimental data seem to indicate a higher stall force . Indeed , our experimental data show that depolymerization remains signiﬁcant for forces as high as 2 . 4 pN . Under these conditions , mDia1 produces a mechanical work of B 13 pN nm E 3 . 2 kT for every departing actin subunit . Discussion To describe the conformation changes of the FH2 dimer during ﬁlament elongation , one can use the ‘gating factor’ , which is deﬁned as the ratio of the elongation rate of barbed ends with and without FH2 , in the absence of proﬁlin 21 . The gating factor can be written as p 0 k FH2on = k on , where k FH2on and k on are the monomer on - rate constants in the presence and absence of an FH2 dimer , respectively . For mDia1 , the gating factor is of the order of 0 . 9 . If we assume that the translocation of the FH2 domain is not affected by proﬁlin , our estimated value of p 0 ¼ 0 . 56 leads to k FH2on ¼ 1 : 6 k on . Our results therefore indicate that the mDia1 FH2 dimer , when present at the ﬁlament barbed end in the open conformation , increases the on - rate constant of actin monomers by 60 % . Formin mechano - sensitivity has been proposed by Kozlov and Bershadsky 14 to stem from FH2 elasticity .

Nonetheless , it is possible that formin elasticity contributes to the energy landscape sketched in Fig . 4 . The FH1 domain is often presented as a ﬂexible chain that captures and delivers proﬁlin – actin to the barbed end 21 . The FH1 domain of mDia1 comprises n ¼ 14 polyproline domains of length d E 3 nm , separated by linkers . Assuming these linkers are ﬂexible , we can model the FH1 domain as a ﬂexible chain , with an ‘entropic spring’ stiffness of 3 kT / nd 2 E 0 . 1 pN nm (cid:2) 1 . A 1 pN force should then be able to stretch the FH1 domain , keeping its extremities 10 nm apart . This is a signiﬁcant constraint on the possible conformations that the FH1 chain , which has a full contour length of about 42 nm , is able to explore . If the FH1 domain delivers proﬁlin – actin to the barbed end by taking advantage of its ﬂexibility to rapidly explore different conformations , the elongation rate of mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) - bound ﬁlaments should decrease drastically when piconewton forces are applied on the FH1 domain , compared with the situation where the pulling force is applied to the FH2 domain alone . Beyond this ‘capture and delivery’ mechanism , it seems likely that during FH1 - assisted elongation the newly added actin subunit is transiently bound to proﬁlin - FH1 and to the FH2 - ﬁlament barbed end simultaneously . This conﬁguration should become extremely difﬁcult to achieve when polyproline regions of the FH1 domain are pulled away from the barbed end by pN forces . Our results therefore indicate that the ﬂexible FH1 domain is able to remain in the vicinity of the FH2 dimer and the barbed end , in spite of a pulling force applied on its N - terminal extremity . This could be achieved by interactions of FH1 polyproline helices with FH2 alpha - helices . 24 Such a connection between the FH1 and FH2 domains could lead to a situation where the N - terminal region of the FH1 domain is maintained close to the C - terminal region of the FH2 domain , and pulling on one or the other would have very similar consequences . Elucidating the detailed function of FH1 in rapid processive growth from proﬁlin – actin will require the combination of mechanical experiments like the present ones and of biochemical approaches 25 , which by themselves have not brought deﬁnite answers .

The ﬁlament barbed end is in a non - polymerizing state when the FH2 dimer is in the ‘closed’ conformation , while it can bind an actin monomer ( not shown ) when the FH2 dimer is in the ‘open’ conformation 15 . When analysing ﬁlament depolymerization , we consider that the FH2 dimer in the ‘open’ conformation prevents the departure of the terminal actin subunit from the barbed end . Applying a pulling force tilts the energy landscape of the FH2 dimer at the barbed end , favouring the ‘open’ conformation . In the frame of reference of the microchamber , the FH2 dimer is in a ﬁxed location and the ﬁlament is displaced as it elongates or depolymerizes .

Formin mDia1 bears more similarities with the latter as it does not hydrolyse ATP , and converts energy from actin conformational changes into mechanical work . However , even though mDia1 does not directly induce depolymerization , it largely ampliﬁes the depolymerizing action of proﬁlin ( Fig . 5b ) . The pulling forces that we apply to the ﬁlaments also detach formins from the surface ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) , thereby limiting the collection of data at high forces , and precluding the study of the force dependence of formin departure from the barbed end ( processivity ) . With a stronger anchoring of formins to the surface , future experiments should allow the study of the release of the ﬁlament by mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) and provide accurate measurements of the stall force of depolymerization . Nonetheless , the pulling forces generated by mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) that we measure are large enough to play a role in cells . Very recent evidence from cell studies indicates that this could indeed be the case . Romero et al . 30 have shown that the stall force of ﬁlopodium retraction strongly depends on the molecular details of ﬁlopodium tip adhesion . This result suggests that the proteins located at the ﬁlopodium tip , including formins , actively participate in the generation of the pulling forces responsible for retraction . Two other very recent studies in cells 31 , 32 report that cytokinetic ring contraction requires actin depolymerization , and still takes place when myosin motor activity is suppressed . This implies that actomyosin contraction is not the only way to generate mechanical tension in cells . Our ﬁndings show that formins anchored to depolymerizing ﬁlaments are a molecular alternative to produce the required pulling forces . Methods Proteins and buffers . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit muscle . Recombinant Proﬁlin I from mouse was expressed in E . Coli and puriﬁed . Spectrin - actin seeds were puriﬁed from human erythrocytes . Fluorescent actin was labelled with Alexa488 succinimidyl ester . ADP - actin was made from Ca - ATP - actin , using hexokinase and glucose , converted into Mg - ADP - actin by adding MgCl 2 and EGTA at the beginning of each experiment , and kept on ice for a maximum of 2h . Formin mDia1 ( GST - FH1 - FH2 - DAD - His 6 ) , simply referred to as mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) , was expressed in E . Coli and puriﬁed 9 . Biotinylated mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) was obtained by incubating mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) with either biotinylated anti - His antibody ( mouse monoclonal IgG , AnaSpec ) or biotinylated anti - GST antibody ( mouse monoclonal IgG , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) for at least 1h on ice . The antibody - to - mDia1FH1FH2 ratio was varied between 0 . 046 and 2 . 3 and no differences were observed in the resulting force - velocity curves . Standard elongation and depolymerization of ﬁlaments was done in F - buffer ( 5mM TRIS pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 01 % NaN3 , 100mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM EGTA ) supplemented with 10mM DTT and 1mM DABCO to limit photobleaching . ATP was replaced with ADP þ 10 m M Ap5A in experiments with ADP - actin . Nucleation of ﬁlaments by mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) was carried out at a lower ionic strength , using 50mM KCl . All measurements were carried out at 25 (cid:2) C . Sample preparation . Glass coverslips were cleaned by sonication in Hellmanex followed by ethanol , rinsed in water and blow dried . Microﬂuidic chambers were built by assembling clean glass coverslips to PDMS structures composed of three entry channels and one exit channel ( more details below ) . The microchambers were placed on the microscope stage , and connected to the microﬂuidic system 17 . For control experiments where ﬁlament barbed ends grow freely , the microchambers were incubated with spectrin - actin seeds , followed by a solution of BSA . For experiments with anchored mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) , the chamber was incubated repeatedly with biotinylated BSA , BSA and Streptavidin , before incubation with biotinylated mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) . The speciﬁcity of the anchoring of mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) via its biotin tag was tested by ﬂowing mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) pre - incubated with biotinylated antibodies in one half of the microﬂuidic chamber , and mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) alone in the other half , and verifying that ﬁlaments were subsequently nucleated in the region exposed to biotinylated mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) only . The elongation rates of ﬁlaments growing from anchored mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) in the absence of mechanical tension were identical to the ones measured on ﬁlaments growing from adsorbed spectrin - actin seeds with mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) at their barbed end . Microscopes . TIRF and epiﬂuorescence observations were carried out on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope , with a (cid:3) 60 TIRF objective , and a 473nm laser ( Cobolt ) . Images were acquired using a cascade II EMCCD camera ( Photometrics ) . The angles of incidence of the laser beam were determined by mounting a triangular prism on the microscope stage . 33 As the refractive indices of the glass coverslip and buffer solution are known with limited accuracy 33 , we have measured the penetration depth of the TIRF excitation ﬁeld by monitoring ﬂuorescent microbeads in the ﬂow chamber ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . The optical trap setup was built on a Nikon eclipse TE2000 - U inverted microscope , using an 1064nm laser , and opto - actoustic deﬂectors ( AA opto - electronics ) for attenuation and deﬂection . Polystyrene microbeads ( Polysciences ) of 2 m m diameter were used for trapping . The optical trap stiffness was calibrated using the Stokes force on microbeads in a microﬂuidic ﬂow , and conﬁrmed by the roll - off frequency technique applied in glass microchambers . These measurements were carried out 5 or 10 m m above the coverslip surface , and the same results were obtained at both positions , conﬁrming that the surface was far enough not to perturb these measurements . 34 Images were acquired using an Orca Flash camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Microﬂuidic system . PDMS microchambers were made from photoresist moulds ( Stanford Microﬂuidics Foundry ) , and mounted on clean glass coverslips . The chambers are composed of three inlets and one outlet . Observations were carried out in the main channel , a few hundred micrometres downstream of the inlets’ junction . The main channel is 1mm wide and 42 m m high . The ﬂow of solutions in the chamber is controlled and monitored using a MAESFLO system ( MFCS and Flowell , from Fluigent ) . We have veriﬁed that the ﬂow rates indicated by the ﬂow metres on the three inlets of our microﬂuidic apparatus were accurate , within a few per cent . Force calibration and control experiments . The friction coefﬁcient of actin ﬁlaments was determined using ﬂuorescent ﬁlaments growing from spectrin - actin seeds adsorbed on microbeads held in an optical trap , as depicted in Fig . 1a . Force and length were measured within 5s , for different ﬁlament lengths . Force was calibrated for each bead , before growing the ﬁlament . The ﬂow velocity at the position of the bead was measured by releasing the bead and monitoring its movement . These measurements allowed us to verify that the force is proportional to ﬁlament length times ﬂow velocity , and that the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlament did not bias the measurement . These measurements were repeated at different heights , 5 – 10 m m above the surface , and in different microchambers , 40 – 100 m m high , hence with different local ﬂow velocity gradients . This allowed us to verify that the application of a ﬂow velocity gradient had no measurable impact on the force . By monitoring the movement of polystyrene microbeads in the microchamber , we have mapped the velocity proﬁle of the microﬂuidic ﬂow along the vertical axis . Data were in very good agreement with the theoretical parabolic proﬁle ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Thus , the ﬂow proﬁle near the surface is well approximated by a linear function , with a slope that can be computed from the global incoming ﬂow rate and the microchamber dimensions . Using TIRF microscopy , we have taken advantage of the exponential decay of the evanescent excitation ﬁeld to monitor the vertical position and the ﬂuctuations of the anchored ﬁlaments in the ﬂuid ﬂow ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . These mea - surements were done on highly labelled ﬁlaments ( 30 – 70 % Alexa488 ) in order to have a homogeneous ﬂuorescence . We ﬁnd that ﬂuctuations are larger near the free end of the ﬁlament , and larger over the whole ﬁlament for lower ﬂow rates . Nevertheless , except for a short region ( less than 2 m m long ) near the anchoring point , the different portions of the ﬁlaments are located 250nm above the surface on average , and ﬂuctuate within ± 30 % of this plane . For a given ﬁlament proﬁle ( that is , a set of z - positions for different portions of the ﬁlament ) , we can compute the force exerted by the ﬂowing ﬂuid on the ﬁlament and transmitted to the anchoring point , by integrating the viscous drag exerted on each portion of the ﬁlament . We have veriﬁed that the result was not affected by the size and number of the ﬁlament portions that we considered . By acquiring TIRF images of the ﬂuctuating ﬁlament with a high frame rate ( down to 17ms between images ) we can monitor the force ﬂuctuations over time . For the present range of ﬂow velocities ( up to 200 m ms (cid:2) 1 ) and ﬁlament lengths ( up to 50 m m ) , taking the ﬂow velocity 250nm above the surface and the full - length of the ﬁlament reliably gives the average of the force distribution exerted on the anchoring point . Fluctuations are very rapid : the full breadth of the force distribution is explored in less than a second . This ensures that the average force exerted on the anchoring point between two images in our experiments ( typically 5s ) is the average force of the distribu - tion . The effect of force ﬂuctuations was estimated by a convolution of the theoretical curves , and found to be negligible . The local ﬂow velocity experienced by surface - anchored ﬁlaments was conﬁrmed by exposing highly ﬂuorescent ﬁlaments to continuous TIRF illumination in order to fragment them , and monitoring the velocity of detaching fragments with a high camera frame rate . The measured velocities are in good agreement with the height positions estimated by TIRF , with the expected velocity proﬁle near the surface of the ﬂow cell . Control experiments with ﬁlaments grown from surface - anchored spectrin - actin seeds were performed in order to measure the elongation and depolymerization rates in the absence of force . These experiments were done with 5 – 12 % ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms2888 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 4 : 1883 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms2888 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications & 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

These experiments also showed that the activity of mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) bound to free barbed ends was not affected by the length of the ﬁlament or the microﬂuidic ﬂow rate . Image analysis . Images were analysed using ImageJ . Contrast was enhanced using the KymoToolBox plugin ( available from fabrice . cordelieres @ curie . upsud . fr ) . The ﬂuorescent segment of actin ﬁlaments was tracked using the ‘snake ﬁt’ pro - gramme 35 . Very short ﬂuorescent segments were tracked using the ‘spot tracker 2D 0 plugin in Image J ( available at http : / / bigwww . epﬂ . ch / spottracker / ) . We consider that each actin subunit contributes to 2 . 7nm of the ﬁlament length . We thus obtained length - versus - time data , which we could ﬁt to extract elongation or depolymerization rates . Knowing the ﬂow rate ( measured by the MAESFLO microﬂuidic apparatus during the experiment ) and the length of the ﬁlament ( full - length , including both the unlabelled and the ﬂuorescently labelled segment ) , we can compute the force exerted on the surface - anchored mDia1 ( FH1FH2 ) .
