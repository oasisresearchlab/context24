The Anarchy of Numbers : Aid , Development , and Cross - Country Empirics David Roodman The recent literature contains many stories of how foreign aid affects economic growth . Aid raises growth in countries with good policies , or with difﬁcult economic environ - ments , or outside the tropics , or on average but with diminishing returns . The diversity of the results suggests that many are fragile . Seven important aid - growth papers are tested for robustness , using 14 minimally arbitrary tests deriving mainly from differences among the studies themselves . This approach investigates the importance of potentially arbitrary speciﬁcation choices while minimizing the arbitrariness in testing choices . All of the results appear fragile , especially to sample expansion . JEL Codes : F35 , O23 , O40 In early 1981 , economist Edward Leamer gave a lecture at the University of Toronto , in which he bemoaned the state of econometrics . Econometrics sought the status of a science , with regressions as its analog for the reproduci - ble experiments of chemistry or physics . Yet an essential part of econometric “experimentation” was too often arbitrary , opaque , and unrepeatable . “The econometric art as it is practiced at the computer terminal involves ﬁtting many , perhaps thousands , of statistical models . . . . This search for a model is often well intentioned , but there can be no doubt that such a speciﬁcation search invalidates the traditional theories of inference” ( Leamer 1983 , p . 36 ) . The way out of the quagmire , he argued , was for econometricians to explore larger regions of “speciﬁcation space , ” systematically analyzing the relationship between assumptions and conclusions . One econometric debate with hallmarks of the syndrome Leamer describes is that on the effectiveness of foreign aid in developing countries . Since Grifﬁn and Enos ( 1970 ) , econometricians have parried over the question of how aid affects economic growth .

But Burnside and Dollar are just one voice among many . Collier and Dehn ( 2001 ) , Collier and Dollar ( 2002 , 2004 ) , and Collier and Hoefﬂer ( 2004 ) cor - roborate their ﬁnding , whereas others challenge it . From the ongoing debate emerge several stories of the relationship between aid and growth , each turning on a particular quadratic or interaction term involving aid . The stories are not incompatible , but most of the papers support only one . Hansen and Tarp ( 2001 ) ﬁnd that entering the square of aid drives out aid (cid:2) policy and makes the simple aid term signiﬁcant too : aid works on average , but with diminishing returns . Guillaumont and Chauvet ( 2001 ) also fail to ﬁnd signiﬁcance for aid (cid:2) policy and instead offer evidence that aid works best in countries with difﬁcult economic environments , characterized by volatile and declining terms of trade , low population , and natural disasters . In the same vein Collier and Dehn ( 2001 ) ﬁnd that increasing aid cushions countries against negative export price shocks . Collier and Hoefﬂer ( 2004 ) offer a triple - interaction term : aid works particularly well in countries that are recovering from civil war and that have good policies . Last , Dalgaard , Hansen , and Tarp ( 2004 ) say that aid raises growth outside the tropics but not in them . These papers differ not only in their conclusions but in their speciﬁcations as well . Within the group there are two choices of period length in the panel data sets , three deﬁnitions of policy , three of aid , and four choices of control variable sets . Although probably none of the choices is made on a whim , these differences appear to be examples of what Leamer called “whimsy . ” From Leamer’s point of view the studies together represent a small sampling of speci - ﬁcation space . And few include much robustness testing . Without further analy - sis , it is hard to know whether the results reveal solid underlying regularities in the data or are fragile artifacts of particular speciﬁcation choices . This article examines the possibility of fragility systematically . Since by the laws of chance any regression can be broken with enough experimentation , it is essential for credibility that the testing suite itself be minimally arbitrary . The tests derive from two sources : the choices present in the original speciﬁca - tions , and the passage of time , which allows expansion of data sets ( as in Easterly , Levine , and Roodman 2004 ) . In all , regressions from seven of the most prominent studies are subjected to this systematic test suite . Section I reviews the approaches and conclusions of the studies that are tested for robustness , section II describes the tests , and section III reports the results . I . H I S TO RY O F A I D A N D G ROW T H S T U D I E S The hope has often arisen that a turn to the numbers would shed light on the questions of whether and when foreign aid works . In the view of Hansen and 256 THE WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW Tarp ( 2000 ) the aid effectiveness literature has gone through three generations . The ﬁrst generation essentially spans 1970 – 72 and mainly investigates the aid - savings link . Inﬂuenced by the Harrod - Domar model , in which savings is the binding constraint on growth , aid - induced saving is assumed to lead directly to investment and then to growth through a ﬁxed incremental capital - output ratio . The second generation runs from the early 1970s to the early 1990s and directly investigates whether aid affects investment and growth . Hansen and Tarp argue that the preponderance of the evidence from these ﬁrst two generations shows that aid increases total savings , but less than one for one , and that aid increases investment and growth . They suggest that studies with more pessimistic results , such as Mosley , Hudson , and Horrell ( 1987 ) , gained disproportionate attention precisely because they are contrarian . The third generation , which began with Boone ( 1994 ) and continues to this day , is the focus of this article . It brought several innovations . The data sets cover more countries and years . Reﬂecting the inﬂuence of the new growth theory , regressors are typically included to represent the economic and insti - tutional environment ( sometimes together called the “policy environment” ) . The potential endogeneity of aid is addressed through instrumenting . And the marginal aid - growth slope is allowed to vary , through the incorporation of such regressors as aid 2 and aid (cid:2) policy . The data sets are almost always panels . Burnside and Dollar ( 2000 ) test whether an interaction term of aid and an index of recipient country economic policies are signiﬁcantly associated with growth . Their panel is drawn from developing countries outside the former Eastern bloc , covering the six four - year periods in 1970 – 93 . They incorporate some controls found to be signiﬁcant in the general growth literature : initial income ( log real GDP per capita ) to capture convergence ; ethno - linguistic frac - tionalization ( Easterly and Levine 1997 ) , assassinations per capita ( Banks 2002 ) , and the product of the two ; the Knack - Keefer ( 1995 ) institutional quality variable , the International Country Risk Guide Economic rating ( ICRGE ) ; the ratio of M2 to GDP , to indicate ﬁnancial depth , lagged one period to avoid endogeneity ( King and Levine 1993 ) ; and dummy variables for Sub - Saharan Africa and fast - growing East Asia . Burnside and Dollar use a measure of aid called effective development assist - ance ( EDA ; Chang , Fernandez - Arias , and Serven 1998 ) . EDA differs in two major respects from the usual net ofﬁcial development assistance ( ODA ) measure tabulated by the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development – Development Assistance Committee ( OECD – DAC 2002 ) . First , EDA excludes technical assistance , on the grounds that it funds not so much recipient governments as consultants . Second , it differs in its treatment of loans . Net ODA counts disbursements of concessional ( low - interest ) loans only , but at full face value . 1 As a capital ﬂow concept , it nets out principal but 1 . The DAC considers a loan concessional if it has a grant element of at least 25 percent of the loan value , using a 10 percent discount rate . Roodman 257 not interest payments on old loans . In contrast , EDA includes development loans , regardless of how concessional ( for example , it includes loans on near - commercial terms by the World Bank to middle - income countries such as Brazil ) , but counts only their grant element—that is , their net present value . Concerned about limited statistical power , Burnside and Dollar combine their economic policy indicators into a single variable . They ﬁrst run a growth regression without aid terms , but with all controls and three indicators of economic policy—log ( 1 þ inﬂation ) , budget balance as a percentage of GDP , and the Sachs - Warner ( 1995 ) openness variable . All three policy variables are signiﬁcantly different from zero at the 0 . 05 level , so Burnside and Dollar form a linear combination of the three using their coefﬁcients as weights . 2 When Burnside and Dollar run their base speciﬁcation including aid and aid (cid:2) policy , the term of central interest , aid (cid:2) policy does not enter signiﬁ - cantly . However , it becomes signiﬁcant after either of two possible changes . Five outlier observations can be excluded ( giving Burnside and Dollar’s pre - ferred speciﬁcation ) . Or a quadratic interaction term can be added— aid 2 (cid:2) policy , in which case both aid (cid:2) policy and aid 2 (cid:2) policy appear signiﬁcantly different from zero , the ﬁrst with a positive sign and the second with a nega - tive . Burnside and Dollar famously conclude that aid raises growth in a good policy environment , but with diminishing returns . Burnside and Dollar’s work has triggered responses , some critical , some sup - portive . Hansen and Tarp ( 2001 ) make one prominent attack . They modify the Burnside and Dollar two - stage least - squares ( 2SLS ) regressions in several ways , most importantly by adding aid 2 . Aid (cid:2) policy is not signiﬁcant in their results , but aid and aid 2 are , the ﬁrst with a positive sign and the second with a nega - tive . The implication is that aid is effective on average , but with diminishing returns—regardless of recipients’ policies as far as the evidence goes . Hansen and Tarp then criticize both the Burnside and Dollar regressions and their own for failing to handle several standard concerns . There may be country - level ﬁxed effects that correlate with both policies and growth . Failing to purge or control for all such effects could give spurious explanatory power to policy and aid (cid:2) policy . Also , variables other than aid and its interaction terms , such as ﬁscal balance , could be endogenous and need instrumenting too . They deploy the Arellano - Bond ( 1991 ) generalized method of moments ( GMM ) estimator , which is designed to handle these problems in short panels . Hansen and Tarp also add the change in aid ( D aid ) and D aid 2 as regressors . 3 Their 2SLS results on aid and aid 2 hold . And D aid and D aid 2 are signiﬁcant too , again , the ﬁrst with a positive sign and the second with a negative . 2 . They also add a constant term to the index , but this has no effect on the regression results of interest here . 3 . This is equivalent to adding lagged aid and lagged aid 2 since the regressions also control for aid and aid 2 . 258 THE WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW Guillaumont and Chauvet ( 2001 ) tell a third story . They hypothesize that the economic vulnerability of a country inﬂuences aid effectiveness . They call econ - omic vulnerability the “environment , ” not to be confused with Burnside and Dollar’s “policy environment . ” In this story , aid ﬂows stabilize countries that are particularly buffeted by terms of trade difﬁculties , other sorts of external shocks , or natural disasters . Guillaumont and Chauvet build an environment index out of four variables : volatility of agricultural value added ( to proxy for natural dis - asters ) , volatility of export earnings , long - term terms of trade trend , and log of population ( small countries being more vulnerable to external forces ) . Their speciﬁcation is distinctive in using 12 - year periods , and in its controls , which include population growth , mean years of secondary school education among adults ( Barro and Lee 2000 ) ; the Barro - Lee ( 1994 ) measure of political instability , based on assassinations and revolutions ; ethno - linguistic fractionalization ; and lagged M2 / GDP . In their OLS and 2SLS regressions , aid (cid:2) environment appears with the predicted negative sign , indicating that aid works better in countries with worse environments . The term also drives out aid (cid:2) policy . Collier and Dollar ( 2002 ) corroborate Burnside and Dollar with a quite differ - ent data set and speciﬁcation . Unlike Burnside and Dollar , they perform OLS estimations only . They include former Eastern bloc countries , the Bahamas , and Singapore . They use net ODA rather than EDA . They study 1974 – 97 instead of 1970 – 93 . They drop all Burnside and Dollar controls except log initial GDP per capita , ICRGE , and period dummy variables . But they add region dummy variables . 4 And they deﬁne policy as the overall score from the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment ( CPIA ) , a composite rating of countries on some 20 aspects of policies and institutions . 5 They add aid 2 but then drop the linear aid term from their preferred speciﬁcation as insigniﬁcant . After all the changes aid (cid:2) policy is again signiﬁcant , as is aid 2 , with a negative sign . Starting from the Collier and Dollar core regression , Collier and Hoefﬂer ( 2004 ) analyze how recent emergence from civil war inﬂuences aid effective - ness . Sticking to the four - year panel , they create three dummy variables to indi - cate how recently civil war ended . Peace onset is one in the period when a country goes from civil war to peace . Post - conﬂict 1 is one in the following period and post - conﬂict 2 is one in the period after that—assuming that civil war does not recur . Aid (cid:2) policy (cid:2) post - conﬂict 1 is signiﬁcant in Collier and Hoefﬂer’s preferred ( OLS ) speciﬁcation : aid works particularly well in a good policy environment a few years after civil conﬂict . Also corroborating Burnside and Dollar , Collier and Dehn ( 2001 ) hew closely to the Burnside and Dollar speciﬁcation and data set and tell a story 4 . The regions are Europe and Central Asia , Middle East and North Africa , Southern Asia , East Asia and Paciﬁc , Sub - Saharan Africa , and Latin America and the Caribbean , as deﬁned by the World Bank . 5 . Collier and Hoefﬂer ( 2004 ) make a small correction to the Collier and Dollar data set , excluding ﬁve observations where a missing value had been treated as zero . The Collier and Hoefﬂer version of the Collier and Dollar regression is tested here . Roodman 259 that incorporates elements from Guillaumont and Chauvet ( 2001 ) . They ﬁnd that adding variables incorporating information on export shocks renders Burnside and Dollar’s preferred speciﬁcation—the one with aid (cid:2) policy but not aid 2 (cid:2) policy —more robust to the inclusion of Burnside and Dollar’s ﬁve outliers . First , they add two variables indicating the magnitude of any positive or negative commodity export price shocks . They report that aid (cid:2) policy is then signiﬁcant at 0 . 01 for a regression on the full data set . The negative - shock variable is signiﬁcant too , with the expected minus sign . 6 Then Collier and Dehn add four aid – shock interaction terms : lagged aid (cid:2) positive shock , lagged aid (cid:2) negative shock , D aid (cid:2) positive shock , and D aid (cid:2) negative shock . The ﬁrst and last prove positive and signiﬁcant in OLS , and the last , D aid (cid:2) negative shock , proves particularly robust in their testing . The study buttresses Burnside and Dollar while suggesting that well - timed aid increases ameliorate negative export shocks . This matches the Guillaumont and Chauvet result in spirit . But where Guillaumont and Chauvet interact the amount of aid with the standard deviation of an index of export volume and other variables , Collier and Dehn’s signiﬁcant term involves the change in aid and the change in export prices . Dalgaard , Hansen , and Tarp ( 2004 ) tell a novel aid - growth story . They focus on the share of a country’s area that is in the tropics as a determinant of both growth and the inﬂuence of aid on growth . This variable surfaces as a growth determinant in Bloom and Sachs ( 1998 ) , Gallup and Sachs ( 1999 ) , and Sachs ( 2001 , 2003 ) . The causal links may include institutions and economic policies ( Acemoglu , Johnson , and Robinson 2001 ; Easterly and Levine 2003 ) . Dalgaard , Hansen , and Tarp thus see tropical area as an exogenous “deep determinant” of growth . In the regressions , aid and aid (cid:2) tropical area fraction are signiﬁcant , the ﬁrst with a positive sign and the second with a negative sign and similar magnitude . For countries situated completely in the tropics , the derivative of growth with respect to aid ( the sum of the two coefﬁcients ) is indistinguishable from zero . Thus , on average , aid seems to work outside the tropics but not inside them . The authors report that their new interaction term drives out both aid (cid:2) policy and aid 2 . There are other third - generation studies ( Hadjimichael and others 1995 ; Durbarry , Gemmell , and Greenaway 1998 ; Svensson 1999 ; Lensink and White 2001 ; Chauvet and Guillaumont 2002 ; Burnside and Dollar 2004 ) . This article focuses on those already highlighted as being among the most inﬂuential and , with one exception , having been published . The exception is Collier and Dehn ( 2001 ) , which is a pillar of the published Collier and Dollar ( 2004 ) . The testing here applies to what appear to be the authors’ preferred regressions ( table 1 ) . Country by country the tested regressions generate a 6 . However , the reproduction using their data gives a t statistic of only 0 . 42 to aid (cid:2) policy despite having the same R 2 and sample size , so their result may be an error . But the same negative sign does appear in the reproduction on the negative - shock variable . 260 THE WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW T A BLE 1 .

Roodman 263 diversity of conclusions about the slope of growth with respect to aid at the margin ( table 2 illustrates these conclusions for the 20 largest aid recipients in 1998 ) . As an example of the calculations here , the Burnside and Dollar ( 2000 ) structural equation is D Y ¼ a A þ b A (cid:2) P þ g P þ x d þ 1 ; where Y is GDP per capita , A is aid , P is policy , x is a vector of controls , including initial GDP / capita , and 1 is the error term . So the implied slope of growth with respect to aid is d ( D Y ) / dA ¼ a þ b P , which depends on the recipi - ent’s policy level . Applying such formulas to 1998 data , the Burnside and Dollar regression generally predicts beneﬁts from increasing aid while , at the other extreme , the Dalgaard , Hansen , and Tarp ( 2004 ) and Guillaumont and Chauvet ( 2001 ) regressions express pessimism . The question is what to make of such conclusions . I I . T H E T E S T S U I T E There is some robustness testing in the recent literature on aid - growth connec - tions , albeit focusing on Burnside and Dollar ( 2000 ) . Lu and Ram ( 2001 ) introduce ﬁxed effects into the Burnside and Dollar regressions . Ram ( 2004 ) splits the aid variable into the components coming from bilateral and multi - lateral donors and also tests alternative deﬁnitions of policy . Dalgaard and Hansen ( 2001 ) modify the choice of excluded outliers . Easterly , Levine , and Roodman ( 2004 ) extend the Burnside and Dollar data set to additional countries and an additional period , 1994 – 97 . All these tests eliminate the key Burnside and Dollar result . The present study expands Easterly , Levine , and Roodman ( 2004 ) along two dimensions . It tests more studies . And it applies more tests . In addition to fragility , the other bugaboo of econometrics is misspeciﬁca - tion . Important questions can be raised about the validity of the regressions tested here . Some exhibit serial correlation in the errors . 7 The excludability and relevance of instruments are legitimate concerns . Regressors treated as exogen - ous may not be . And term pairs such as aid and aid 2 may be multicollinear . But for the sake of concision , this article focuses on the problem of fragility . The Tests The tests applied to these third - generation aid - growth regressions constitute a more systematic sampling of “speciﬁcation space” than has hitherto been done . 7 . An earlier version of this article attempted to address autocorrelation by further modifying the tested speciﬁcations , at the expense of complexity in presentation and , arguably , “whimsy . ” In particular , most of the test regressions included the log of population as a control since Sargan - type tests suggested it was an improperly excluded instrument . This explains the difference in results between this and the earlier version . 264 THE WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW To limit complexity and minimize arbitrariness , each test involves changing just one aspect of the estimations at a time ( the tests are summarized in table 3 ) . The ﬁrst four groups of tests—relating to the controls , the deﬁnition of aid and policy , and period length—transfer one speciﬁcation’s choices to the others . 8 Last are tests that modify the sample by dropping outliers or expand - ing to new countries and periods . There are six groups of tests : ( 1 ) Changing the control set . In Leamer’s worries about whimsy , the spe - ciﬁcation choice that concerns him is that of regressors . The studies examined use four different control sets , which give rise to four robustness tests ( detailed in table 3 ) . Each substitutes an alternative control set for the original one and examines the effect on the signiﬁ - cance of key terms . Like the authors of the original regressions , and in the spirit of avoiding arbitrariness , the robustness tests here use all the complete observations available for developing countries ( including the countries of Eastern Europe ) . Because different variables are available for differ - ent subsets of countries , changing the regressor set changes the regression sample . One could perform variants of the tests that are restricted to the intersections of the old and new samples in an attempt to distinguish the effects of changing samples and changing variables . This course is not taken here because it would add to the complexity , would still cause sample changes , and would not answer the hypothetical question , “What would the results have been if the original authors had used alternative controls ? ” The authors almost certainly would have used all available observations . ( 2 ) Redeﬁning aid . All the studies take total aid received as a share of recipi - ent GDP . But there are differences in deﬁning both the numerator and denominator of the ratio . Burnside and Dollar ( 2000 ) , Collier and Dehn ( 2001 ) , and Dalgaard , Hansen , and Tarp ( 2004 ) use EDA in the numer - ator , whereas the rest use net ODA . On the choice of denominator , there is also a split . Hansen and Tarp ( 2001 ) and Guillaumont and Chauvet ( 2001 ) use GDP converted to dollars at market exchange rates , whereas the others use real GDP from the Penn World Tables ( Summers and Heston 1991 ) . A country’s relative price level strongly correlates with income per capita , with the poorest countries having price levels 20 – 25 percent that of the United States . Thus , using purchasing power parities instead of exchange rates will result in relatively larger GDPs and relatively smaller ratios of aid to GDP for the poorest countries . 8 . Papers that instrument the variables of interest also differ in their choice of instruments . But since different variables ( aid (cid:2) policy in one regression , say , and aid 2 in another ) ought to be instrumented differently , the various instrument sets are less interchangeable and of less use for the approach in this article .

With two options each for measuring aid and GDP , there are four possible combinations for the aid to GDP ratio . The literature includes all but EDA / exchange rate GDP , and these are the bases for three tests . 9 In fact , EDA / real GDP and ODA / real GDP are highly correlated ( Dalgaard and Hansen 2001 ) , so switching from one to the other may not stress results much ( table 4 ) . ( 3 ) Redeﬁning good policy . Three sets of “good policy” variables appear among the tested regressions . One is Burnside and Dollar’s combination of budget balance , inﬂation , and Sachs - Warner openness . A second is inﬂation and Sachs - Warner only ( Hansen and Tarp 2001 ) . And a third is CPIA alone ( Collier and Dollar 2002 ; Collier and Hoefﬂer 2004 ) . These generate three robustness tests . With Burnside and Dollar’s coefﬁcients used to form policy indexes ( 6 . 85 for budget balance , – 1 . 40 for inﬂation , and 2 . 16 for Sachs - Warner ) , the ﬁrst two policy deﬁnitions are highly correlated , at 0 . 98 , but the third varies more distinctly ( see table 4 ) . But in actual application of the tests , the Burnside - Dollar – style index - forming regression is rerun each time ; it includes all regressors except aid and its interaction terms , and the coefﬁcients on the policy T ABLE 4 .

EDA as used here is extrapolated to the rest of 1970 – 2001 through a regression of EDA on net ODA . Roodman 267 variables are used to make the index , regardless of statistical signiﬁcance . 10 ( 4 ) Changing periodization . All but Guillaumont and Chauvet use four - year periods . The lack of higher frequency observations of the Guillaumont and Chauvet environment variable prevents adapting their 12 - year regressions to a 4 - year - period panel . But the other regressions can be tested on 12 - year panels . Notably , key cross - section studies in the growth literature use periods of 10 – 25 years despite the small samples that result ( Barro 1991 ; Mankiw , Romer , and Weil 1992 ; Sachs and Warner 1995 ) . ( 5 ) Removing outliers . The tested Burnside and Dollar speciﬁcation excludes ﬁve observations that are outliers in aid (cid:2) policy and highly inﬂuential on the coefﬁcient on that term . This raises a general question about the importance of outliers . To investigate , one robustness test reruns the reproductions of the original regressions after excluding outliers . Another does the same for the expanded - sample versions ( see sub - sequently ) . Following Easterly , Levine , and Roodman ( 2004 ) , outliers are chosen by applying the Hadi ( 1992 ) procedure for identifying mul - tiple outliers to the partial scatter of growth and a regressor of interest , using 0 . 05 as the cut - off signiﬁcance level . 11 In 2SLS estimations , regres - sors are ﬁrst projected onto instruments . 12 Since the two - dimensional partial scatter plot is not well deﬁned for GMM regressions , in those cases , analogous 2SLS regressions are run to identify outliers . Outliers are not synonymous with inﬂuential observations . But even outliers that do not greatly inﬂuence coefﬁcients of interest can substan - tially affect reported standard errors . In addition , outliers are the obser - vations most likely to signal measurement problems or structural breaks beyond which the core model does not hold—both of which seem better reasons for exclusion than high inﬂuence . That said , outliers do not necessarily signal measurement problems or structural breaks . This is especially possible when the variable of interest is highly non - normal , such as the Collier and Dehn ( 2001 ) export price shock variable . In such cases , outliers may contain valuable information about the development process under rare circumstances . 10 . The constant term in the policy index is computed in the same manner as in Burnside and Dollar . It is the predicted growth rate in the model when the policy variables and the period dummy variables are zero , and all other variables take their sample - average values . 11 . Applying the Hadi procedure directly to a full , many - dimensioned data set typically identiﬁed 20 percent or more of observations as outliers . 12 . This test is even run on the Burnside and Dollar 5 / OLS regressions , from which one set of outliers is already excluded . Regardless of the genesis of these regressions’ results , it is interesting whether they are driven by a few observations in the remaining sample . 268 THE WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW ( 6 ) Expanding the sample . Easterly , Levine , and Roodman ( 2004 ) develop a data set that extends that of Burnside and Dollar from 1970 – 93 to 1970 – 97 and adds six countries . For the current study that data set has been extended to 2001 and improved in other respects . ( See supplemen - tal appendix S . 1 , available at http : / / wber . oxfordjournals . org / . ) This allows a net expansion in both years and countries for all but the Guillaumont and Chauvet regression , whose 12 - year periods and unusual environment variable hinder expansion . Issues in Interpreting Results If Leamer’s ( 1983 ) extreme - bounds analysis is applied to the results of this testing , then a coefﬁcient will be deemed robustly different from zero only if it is signiﬁcantly different from zero in every test . However , as Sala - i - Martin ( 1997 ) argues , this deﬁnition of robustness indeed seems extreme . For example , one could test robustness by averaging together all observations for each global region , generating samples of some six observations . Almost no regression would pass this test . One could argue that this test would be “unfair , ” in that it would be too weak to generate meaningful results . But there is no sharp div - ision between fair and unfair tests . Indeed , in this test suite the 12 - year - period test destroys every regression it can be applied to . It is not obvious whether the test is too strong or the regressions too weak . Thus , robustness should be a con - tinuous rather than a dichotomous concept . Sala - i - Martin offers his own procedure for assessing robustness . In essence , he estimates the cumulative distribution function for a coefﬁcient of interest by running a large number of variants of the regression it comes from . The robust - ness of a coefﬁcient is then the fraction of the density that is on one or the other side of zero . The validity of this concept is based on the assumption , however informal , that the set of regressions actually run is a representative of all possible variants of the original regression . For the collection of tests assembled here , however , that assumption is not valid . For example , one important subset of tests , those expanding the sample , cannot be applied to the Guillaumont and Chauvet ( 2001 ) regression . It does not seem plausible that the test results are representative both with and without this important subset of tests . The sampling of speciﬁcation space that is made here is minimally arbitrary , but cannot be assumed to be representative of all possible tests . Thus , while Leamer’s deﬁnition of robustness may be too harsh for this context , Sala - i - Martin’s has its own limitations . This will be true even if one performs every possible combination of tests in the suite rather than just one at a time . In the end it seems that human judgment applied to the full set of results must substitute for mechanical deﬁnitions of robustness . This in turn means there is some value in keeping the tests few enough for the human mind to embrace . Roodman 269 T A BLE 5 .

R E S U LT S The ﬁrst step in the testing is to use the authors’ data sets to reproduce their original results ( see column 1 of tables 5 and 6 ) . All the reproductions exhibit the same pattern of results as the originals and all but one have the same sample size . 13 The Burnside and Dollar ( 2000 ) , Collier and Dehn ( 2001 ) , and Hansen and Tarp ( 2001 ) reproductions are perfect , and the rest are close . Since the purpose is to test robustness , the inexact matches are not a concern . If the results from the tested regressions are robust , they should withstand what - ever minor changes in data or speciﬁcation cause the discrepancies in the reproductions . Tables 5 and 6 report results on key terms in all tests . 14 Blank cells indicate inapplicable tests . The test involving the deﬁnition of aid as the ratio of EDA to real GDP , for example , is not applicable to regressions that originally use it . Using 12 - year periods does not work for the Collier and Hoefﬂer ( 2004 ) regression , because the deﬁnition of their post - conﬂict 1 variable assumes four - year periods . Lack of higher frequency data for Guillaumont and Chauvet’s ( 2001 ) environment variable prevents short - period tests . A total of 71 robust - ness checks are run . 15 Results for tests inspired by differences among the original regressions are given in table 5 . The Collier and Hoefﬂer result on post - conﬂict 1 (cid:2) aid (cid:2) policy ( or the collinear post - conﬂict 1 (cid:2) aid ) and the Dalgaard , Hansen , and Tarp results for aid and aid (cid:2) tropical area fraction do best . All of these center on sharply bimodal variables : the Collier and Hoefﬂer post - conﬂict 1 dummy variable is one for only 13 of the 344 observations in their original sample , and there are negative shocks in 38 of the 234 Collier and Dehn observations . In the Dalgaard , Hansen , and Tarp ( 2004 ) sample , 233 of the 371 observations are 100 percent tropical and 68 are zero percent , leaving 70 in between . Evidently , regularities involving such variables are more resilient to speciﬁca - tion changes . Results from sample - modifying tests are shown in table 6 . The ﬁrst two result columns are based on regressions on the original authors’ data sets—ﬁrst 13 . The Dalgaard , Hansen , and Tarp ( 2004 ) regression was executed with the DPD for Ox package ( Doornik , Arellano , and Bond 2002 ) . It turns out that a quirk in this software—incomplete observations that create gaps in the time series must always be included in the data ﬁle rather than deleted—led to a slight mishandling of the data . The xtabond2 module for Stata ( Roodman 2006 ) , used here , handles gaps as users intend . This explains the difference in samples . 14 . Full results are available on request . 15 . Initial testing revealed multicollinearity in the Collier and Hoefﬂer regression . In their preliminary regression 3 . 1 ( not regression 3 . 4 , which is tested here ) , they include the variables post - conﬂict 1 , post - conﬂict 1 (cid:2) policy , and post - conﬂict 1 (cid:2) aid 2 , along with the favored post - conﬂict 1 (cid:2) aid (cid:2) policy . In the reproduction of 3 . 1 , post - conﬂict 1 (cid:2) aid (cid:2) policy and post - conﬂict 1 (cid:2) aid have a partial correlation of 0 . 985 , making the two statistically indistinguishable . Thus the Collier and Hoefﬂer results ought to be interpreted as pertaining to either post - conﬂict 1 (cid:2) aid (cid:2) policy or post - conﬂict 1 (cid:2) aid . Occam’s razor argues for the second . Roodman 273 for their full sample and second for the sample excluding outliers . The next pair of columns is analogous , for the expanded data set . The corresponding partial scatter plots in supplemental appendix S . 2 ( available at http : / / wber . oxfordjournals . org / ) illustrate the sample - modifying results and are reminders of the importance of checking for outliers . Except for Guillaumont and Chauvet , all the original OLS and 2SLS results depend on outliers for some or all of their signiﬁcance . The dependence is particularly heavy for the regressions involving aid (cid:2) policy . On the other hand , the lack of signiﬁcance of most of the coefﬁcients under the sample - expansion test is not driven by out - liers . It is worth noting that the Collier and Dehn result on D aid (cid:2) negative shock , another interaction term involving a variable with a highly non - normal distribution , is arguably stronger than it looks . The coefﬁcient is reversed by the exclusion of outliers from the original sample . But it is arguably fallacious to draw conclusions about the role of shocks having excluded many of the most dramatic examples . The overall pattern is clear . The 12 - year test is the toughest—probably because of the small samples—failing all regressions . The new - data test is not far behind , an important point given that the modiﬁcation it involves—a mode - rate sample expansion—is much less radical . When the tables are read by rows ( test subjects ) instead of columns ( tests ) , the Dalgaard , Hansen , and Tarp result on the aid - tropics link is the only one to come through the speciﬁcation - modifying tests strongly . But it too falls down on the sample - modifying tests after outliers are removed . Four of the nine original - sample outliers are for Jordan , covering 1974 – 89 , a period in which that non - tropical country experi - enced high growth and received considerable aid from its neighbors . This con - ﬁrms the conclusion of Rajan and Subramanian ( 2005 ) that the aid (cid:2) tropics result is fragile too . I V . C O N C L U S I O N The results reported here suggest that the fragility found in Easterly , Levine , and Roodman ( 2004 ) for Burnside and Dollar ( 2000 ) is the norm in the cross - country aid - growth literature . Indeed , in a counterpoint to the focus of Leamer ( 1983 ) , Levine and Renelt ( 1992 ) , and Sala - i - Martin ( 1997 ) on the choice of controls as a source of fragility , it turns out that modifying the sample gene - rally affects results the most . For example , in the Collier and Dollar ( 2002 ) regression , half of the speciﬁcation - modifying tests leave the t statistic at 1 . 49 or higher and two more lower it to near 1 . 00 ( see table 5 ) . But adding more years sends it to – 0 . 19—and , after dropping outliers , to – 0 . 81 ( see table 6 ) . Does this mean that the various stories of aid effectiveness should be sum - marily dismissed ? Are recipient policies , exogenous economic factors , and post - conﬂict status irrelevant to aid effectiveness ? Are there no diminishing returns to aid ? Is helping the neediest countries a hopeless task ? No . There can be no doubt that some aid ﬁnances investment and that domestic policies , 274 THE WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW governance , external conditions , and other factors these authors study inﬂuence the productivity of investment . Why then do such stories of aid effectiveness not shine through more clearly ? Aid is probably not a fundamentally decisive factor for development , not as important , say , as domestic savings , inequality , or governance . Moreover , foreign assistance is not homogeneous . It consists of everything from food aid for famine - struck countries to technical advice on building judi - ciaries to loans for paving roads . And much aid is poorly used—or , like venture capital , is like good bets gone bad . Thus the statistical noise tends to drown out the signal . Perhaps researchers will yet unearth more robust answers to the fundamental questions of aid policy . Or perhaps they have hit the limits of cross - country empirics . Either way , robust , valid generalizations have not and will not come easily . Despite decades of trying , cross - country growth empirics have yet to teach us much about whether and when aid works . R EFERENCES Acemoglu , D . , S . Johnson , and J . A .
