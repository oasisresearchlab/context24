One such experience - based constraint is the 24 tendency for people to view tightly organized visual stimuli as single , unified percepts , 25 even when decomposition of those stimuli into component parts ( termed chunk 26 decomposition ) would facilitate problem solving . The current study investigates the 27 neural underpinnings of chunk decomposition in creative problem solving by 28 analyzing event - related potentials . In two experiments , participants decomposed 29 Chinese characters into the character’s component elements and then used the base 30 elements to form a new valid character . The action could require decomposing a 31 “tight” chunk , meaning that the component elements intersected spatially , or a “loose” 32 chunk , in which the component elements did not overlap in space . Behaviorally , 33 individuals made more errors and responded slower to trials involving tight chunks 34 relative to loose - chunks . Analysis of the ERPs revealed that relative to loose chunks , 35 the electrophysiological response to tight chunks contained an increased N2 , an 36 increased N400 , and a decreased late positive complex . Taken together , these results 37 suggest that chunk tightness is a principle determinant of the difficulty of chunk 38 decomposition , and that chunk tightness provokes neural conflict and semantic 39 violations , factors known to influence the N2 and N400 ERP components . 40 Keywords : Chunk tightness ; Chunk decomposition ; insight problem solving ; Chinese 41 character ; ERPs 42 43 44 3 1 . Introduction 45 Insight - based problem solving involves an “impasse - overcoming” sequence , in 46 which people encounter a difficulty that temporarily slows progress to a halt despite 47 all efforts , until suddenly the difficulty is overcome by the act of restructuring an 48 ineffective mental representation ( Cranford & Moss , 2012 ; Knoblich , Ohlsson , Haider , 49 & Rhenius , 1999 ; Kounios & Beeman , 2014 ; Ohlsson , 1984 ) . One typical cause of an 50 impasse in creative problem solving is an experience - based constraint , such as having 51 a mental set or exhibiting functional fixedness , whereby the subject cannot “think 52 outside the box . ” ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; Storm & Angello , 2010 ; Storm & Patel , 2014 ; 53 Luchins , 1942 ; Smith , 1995 ; Duncker , 1945 ) . To solve the problem , one has to discard 54 the ineffective mental representation . 55 Chunk decomposition is a variant of insight - based problem solving whereby 56 subjects must mentally deconstruct a stimulus into simpler components in the service 57 of solving the problem ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; Knoblich , Ohlsson , & Raney , 2001 ; 58 Luo , Niki , & Knoblich , 2006 ; Wu , Knoblich , Wei , & Luo , 2009 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ; 59 Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . During chunk decomposition , particular kinds of 60 experienced - based constraints can interfere with a subject’s ability to partition the 61 stimulus appropriately ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; Wu , Knoblich , & Luo , 2013 ) . The past 62 decades have witnessed a wealth of studies on problem solving associated with 63 experience - based fixations / constraints ( e . g . , Chi & Snyder , 2011 ; Duncker , 1945 ; 64 Knoblich et al . , 1999 , 2001 ; Luchins , 1942 ; Mai et al . 2004 ; Ollinger , Jones , & 65 Knoblich , 2008 ; Smith , 1995 ; Qiu et al . 2006 ; Storm & Angello , 2010 ; Zhao et al . , 66 4 2011 ) . However , relatively little research has focused specifically on chunk 67 decomposition . 68 Chunk decomposition is a reciprocal process to “chunking” . The term 69 “chunking” refers to grouping strongly or weakly associated information components 70 into a meaningful pattern ( Chase & Simon , 1973 ; De Groot , 1978 ; Gobet et al . , 2001 ; 71 Gobet & Lane , 2012 ; Miller , 1956 ) . Chunking has wide application in human 72 cognition ( Gobet et al . , 2001 ) , affecting a diverse set of mental tasks including the 73 learning of action repertoires ( Graybiel , 1998 ) speech ( Gilbert , Boucher , & Jemel , 74 2015 ) , memory ( Miller , 1956 ) , and problem solving ( Chase & Simon , 1973 ; De Groot , 75 1978 ) . Reversing the process , chunk decomposition refers to decomposing a unified 76 chunk into smaller components , paving the way either for regrouping ( Knoblich , et al . , 77 1999 ; Knoblich , Ohlsson , & Raney , 2001 ; Luo , Niki , & Knoblich , 2006 ; Wu , 78 Knoblich , Wei , & Luo , 2009 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) , or for generating a new 79 representation ( Huang , Fan , & Luo , 2015 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ; Wu , Knoblich , & Luo , 80 2013 ) . 81 Chunk tightness is a critical factor that determines the difficulty of chunk 82 decomposition ( Knoblich , et al . , 1999 ; Luo , et al . , 2006 ) . Chunk tightness can be 83 conceptual or perceptual in nature . Conceptually , a chunk is tight if the component 84 elements of the chunk have no independent meaning , and a chunk is loose if the 85 component elements of the chunk carry independent meaning ( Huang et al . , 2015 ; 86 Knoblich , et al . , 1999 , 2001 ; Luo , et al . , 2006 ; Wu , et al . , 2009 , 2013 ) . When the 87 individual elements of the chunk have no independent meaning , the elements are 88 5 more difficult to extract from the larger chunk . For example , in the matchstick 89 problem , “XI = III + III” , people decompose the chunk “X” into two relatively 90 independent components ( “ / ” and “ \ ” ) so that the two components can be reorganized 91 into another chunk “V” , to generate a valid equation , “VI = III + III” . Here “X” is a 92 tight chunk , because the to - be - removed parts ( “ / ” and “ \ ” ) are not meaningful chunks . 93 In contrast , in another matchstick problem , “VII = II + III” , people decompose the 94 chunk “VII” into two components , “VI” and “I” , so that “I” can be combined with 95 “II” to generate a valid equation , “VI = III + III” . In this case , “VII” is a loose chunk , 96 because the to - be - removed component “I” is itself a meaningful chunk . 97 Recently , Zhang and colleagues ( 2015 ) challenged the conceptual definition of 98 chunk tightness , by investigating the effects of both conceptual chunk tightness and 99 perceptual chunk tightness . A chunk is perceptually tight when the component 100 elements of the chunk overlap in space . Perceptual chunk tightness is a type of 101 perceptual bias that has been thoroughly researched by Gestalt psychologists 102 ( Wagemans , Elder , Kubovy , Palmer , Peterson , Singh , & von der Heydt , 2012 ) . Zhang 103 and colleagues hypothesized that in the above example the chunk “X” is tight because 104 the elements ( “ / ” and “ \ ” ) intersect each other , not because “ / ” and “ \ ” have no 105 independent meaning . By contrast , “VII” is a loose chunk , because the to - be - removed 106 component “I” and the to - be - left “VI” are spatially separated , not because “I” and 107 “VI” each carry meaning of their own . Zhang and colleagues tested the claim with a 108 task in which participants had to move some part of a character on the right side to 109 another character on the left side , to get two new characters ( e . g . , “ 巾亢——市几 ” ) . 110 6 The to - be - removed part of each chunk could be conceptually tight ( a set of strokes 111 with no meaning ) , conceptually loose ( a character with its own meaning ) , 112 perceptually tight ( intersecting with other elements of the chunk ) , or perceptually 113 loose ( not overlapping in space with the other elements ) . Though both conceptual and 114 perceptual manipulations of tightness affected performance , perceptual manipulations 115 had a larger impact . 116 Previous studies investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms of chunk 117 decomposition in problem solving have only studied manipulations of conceptual 118 chunk tightness ( Huang et al . , 2015 ; Luo et al . , 2006 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 119 2009 ; 2010 ; 2013 ) . Past work has revealed three major findings . First , chunk 120 decomposition requires the suppression of irrelevant visual information ( Luo et al . , 121 2006 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ) . Alpha oscillations over parietal – occipital 122 regions are associated with the successful suppression of visual information ( Sauseng 123 et al . , 2009 ) , and alpha activity is greater when subjects decompose tight chunks 124 versus loose chunks ( Wu et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , successful chunk decomposition is 125 associated with reduced activity in neural regions relating to attention and visual 126 processing , including the inferior parietal lobe , the bilateral cuneus , and the lingual 127 gyrus ( Luo et al . , 2006 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ) . Second , chunk decomposition involves 128 visuo - spatial processing ( Huang et al . , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2010 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . Chunk 129 decomposition is associated with effective connectivity between the dorsal and ventral 130 visual pathways ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) , and elicits both greater activity in visuo - spatial 131 brain regions ( Huang et al . , 2015 ) , and increased amplitude of the late positive 132 7 complex ( LPC ) , an ERP component sensitive to visuo - spatial processing ( Wu et al . , 133 2013 ) . Third , chunk decomposition , activates the cognitive control network , including 134 the right lateral prefrontal cortex , the pre - supplementary motor area , the inferior 135 frontal junction , and the anterior cingulate cortex ( Huang et al . , 2015 ; Luo et al . , 2006 ; 136 Tang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . 137 The current work examines the underlying neuro - cognitive mechanisms at play 138 when decomposing a tightly - organized percept in the service of insight problem 139 solving . Previous neuroimaging research has neglected the impact of spatial 140 intersection in defining chunk tightness ( e . g . , Knoblich , et al . , 1999 , 2001 ; Luo et al . , 141 2006 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2009 , 2013 ) . The current work uses an adapted 142 Chinese character decomposition task ( Tang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . Chinese 143 characters are used as materials because Chinese characters are perceptual chunks 144 composed of sub - components that can be meaningful or not - meaningful , and that can 145 intersect or be spatially independent ( Fu , Chen , Smith , Iversen , & Matthews , 2002 ; 146 Siok , Perfetti , Jin , & Tan , 2004 ; Tan et al . , 2001 ; Tan , Laird , Li , & Fox , 2005 ; Zhang 147 et al . , 2015 ) . Chinese characters are frequently - used materials in research on chunk 148 decomposition ( e . g . , Huang et al . , 2015 ; Luo et al . , 2006 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 149 2009 , 2013 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . In the current task , there is a source character ( the 150 to - be - decomposed chunk ) and a probe ( the to - be - removed part ) . The task is to remove 151 the probe from the source character to get a valid character . The experiment includes 152 two levels of chunk tightness in the decomposition task : tight chunk decomposition 153 ( TCD ) or loose chunk decomposition ( LCD ) . The current version of the task diverges 154 8 from previous research in two main ways . First , in Tang et al . ( 2016 ) and Wu et al . 155 ( 2013 ) , the researchers presented the source character and the probe simultaneously 156 whereas the current study presents the probe first and the source character afterward . 157 The change reduces horizontal eye - movements between stimuli , but should also 158 engage working memory to a greater degree than in the task used by Tang and 159 colleagues ( 2016 ) , and by Wu and colleagues ( 2013 ) . Second and more importantly , 160 Wu and colleagues ( 2013 ) manipulated chunk tightness according to the conceptual 161 view of chunk tightness , whereby a chunk was tight if the to - be - removed part had 162 meaning on its own , and loose if the to - be - removed part had no individual meaning . 163 In contrast , the current study manipulated chunk tightness according to the spatial 164 relationship between the parts of the source character . Specifically , according to the 165 hypothesis that chunk tightness varies according to the degree of intersection between 166 elements , the to - be - removed part and the to - be - left part intersect each other in the 167 TCD condition , and spatially separate from each other in the LCD condition . 168 The current work includes the recording and analysis of event - related potentials 169 ( ERPs ) in order to elucidate the neural mechanisms involved in chunk decomposition , 170 and to examine how the neural mechanisms unfold over a millisecond timescale . 171 Previous studies have indicated that conflict detection—a critical component of 172 cognitive control—plays an important role in breaking impasses at a moment of 173 insight ( Aziz ‐ Zadeh , Kaplan , & Iacoboni , 2009 ; Dietrich & Kanso , 2010 ; Mai , Luo , 174 Wu , & Luo , 2004 ; Qiu et al . , 2006 ; Subramaniam , Kounios , Parrish , & Jung - Beeman , 175 2009 ; Zhao , Li , Shang , Zhou , & Han , 2014 ) . Some work has suggested that the 176 9 process of conflict detection is reflected by the N2 ERP component when solving an 177 insight - requiring task , such as Chinese riddle comprehension ( Mai et al . , 2004 ; Qiu et 178 al . , 2006 ; Zhao et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , functional magnetic resonance imaging 179 ( fMRI ) studies have provided converging support for the importance of conflict 180 detection in overcoming chunk decomposition difficulty ( Huang et al , 2015 ; Luo et al . , 181 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . Also of note is that the N2 wave is sensitive to visual 182 discrimination difficulty , exhibiting larger amplitude to greater difficulty in a 183 discrimination task ( Senkowski & Herrmann , 2002 ) . Thus , two lines of research 184 suggest that increasing chunk tightness should elicit a larger N2 . In addition , Wu and 185 colleagues ( 2013 ) observed a late positive complex ( LPC ) that is sensitive to 186 manipulations of the difficulty of perceptual transformation . Wu and colleagues 187 suggest that the LPC is an index of visual - spatial processing , thus the current work 188 includes an analysis of the effect of chunk decomposition on the LPC . 189 190 FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE 191 2 . Experiment 1 192 Experiment 1 made a preliminary exploration on the neural mechanism 193 underlying chunk decomposition influenced by chunk tightness , by directly 194 comparing ERPs between the tight and loose chunk decomposition conditions ( TCD 195 vs . LCD ) . 196 2 . 1 . Methods 197 2 . 1 . 1 . Participants 198 10 In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the approval of the local 199 university ethics committee ( Liaoning Normal University ) , 24 right - handed native 200 speakers of Chinese gave written consent prior to participation in exchange for a 201 small honorarium ( ¥ 30 Yuan ) . Two volunteers were excluded before data analysis 202 because of high impedances ( one recorded 20 kΩ in the ground electrode and the 203 other recorded 13 kΩ in the EOG electrode ) , leaving 22 volunteers ( 10 males ; mean 204 age = 22 . 14 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = [ 20 . 96 , 23 . 32 ] ) All volunteers reported 205 normal or corrected - to - normal vision with no history of brain damage or psychiatric 206 illness . 207 2 . 1 . 2 . Stimuli 208 There were 92 normal Chinese source characters , which could be decomposed 209 into two parts : a to - be - removed part / character and a to - be - left part / character . The 210 to - be - removed part was the probe whereas the to - be - left part was the target . Half of 211 the source characters comprised the TCD condition , in which the to - be - removed part 212 and the to - be - left part intersected each other . For example , the source character “ 全 ” 213 could be decomposed into two parts : “ 三 ” and “ 个 ” , which were in a spatially 214 intersecting relationship with each other in the source character . The other half of the 215 source characters comprised the LCD condition , in which the to - be - removed part and 216 the to - be - left part were in a spatially non - intersecting relationship with each other . For 217 example , the source character “ 夺 ” could be decomposed into two parts : “ 大 ” and 218 “ 寸 ” , which were separated from each other in the source character . Three normal 219 sub - types of spatially non - intersecting relationship were included in the LCD 220 11 condition : 20 cases with horizontal offset ( e . g . , “ 女 ” and “ 少 ” in the source character 221 “ 妙 ” ) and 17 cases with vertical offset ( e . g . , “ 大 ” and “ 寸 ” in the source character 222 “ 夺 ” ) and 9 cases with half - surrounding relationship ( e . g . , “ 广 ” and “ 占 ” in the source 223 character “ 店 ” ) . The average stroke number of the source characters , the 224 to - be - removed parts , and the to - be - left parts between the two conditions ( TCD vs . 225 LCD ) was 6 . 70 vs . 6 . 78 , 2 . 78 vs . 2 . 78 and 3 . 96 vs . 4 . 00 , respectively . There were no 226 significant differences in the stroke number of the source character , the to - be - removed 227 part , and the to - be - left part between the two conditions ( TCD vs . LCD ) . Source 228 character frequency was referenced from www . cncorpus . org to determine if frequency 229 of use of the source characters was different between conditions . There was no 230 significant source - character frequency difference between the TCD [ M±SD : ( . 0900 231 ± . 1653 ) % ] and the LCD [ M±SD : ( . 0653 ± . 1236 ) % ] conditions , F ( 1 , 90 ) = . 654 , p 232 = . 42 , η² = . 007 . Another 60 characters were collected to make up 20 filler trials , in 233 which any of the three characters was not a part of another ( e . g . , the characters : “ 卫 ” 234 —— “ 农 ” ——“县” ) . Like the presentation style of the critical trials in both TCD and 235 LCD conditions , the three characters were assigned and respectively presented in the 236 positions of the probe , the source character and the target , but participants were 237 unable to complete the decomposition task ( e . g . , participants were unable to remove 238 “ 卫 ” from “ 农 ” to get “ 县 ” , because “ 卫 ” and “ 县 ” were not the parts of “ 农 ” ) . The 239 20 fillers served to assess how often a participant was guessing when the participant 240 did not actually know the answer . The stimuli were presented on a LCD monitor , 241 subtending approximately 3 . 3 ╳ 3 . 3° of visual angle . 242 12 2 . 1 . 3 . Procedure and task 243 Participants were seated in a silent room , at a viewing distance of approximately 244 1 . 0 m from the computer screen , and were asked to put their right index finger on 245 button “1” and the middle finger on button “2” of the keypad . Three stimuli per trial 246 ( the probe , source character , and target character ) were presented one by one ( see 247 Figure 1 ) . A fixation was followed by a probe ( e . g . , “ 个 ” ) lasting for 1 s , then a source 248 character ( e . g . , “ 全 ” ) was presented for 4 s , during which time participants were asked 249 to remove the previously presented probe from the source character to get a new valid 250 character . Participants pressed “1” if they came up with the answer within 4 s or made 251 no response if they did not think up the answer . Afterwards , one character ( e . g . , “ 三 ” ) 252 was presented for 4 s , participants were asked to respond whether the character was 253 their answer . Participants pressed “1” if the presented character was consistent with 254 their answer or pressed “2” if not . Participants made no response if they had no 255 answer . A blank screen was presented for a random interval between 0 . 6 ~ 0 . 8 s after 256 the first and second stimulus . The source character and the probe were presented 257 separately to reduce horizontal eye movements . The 112 trials ( 46 trials in TCD 258 condition , 46 trials in LCD condition and 20 fillers ) were equally distributed into two 259 blocks and order was randomized within each block . There were 10 practice trials 260 before the formal experiment . 261 2 . 1 . 4 . ERP recordings and analysis 262 Electroencephalography ( EEG ) was recorded from 64 scalp sites using tin 263 electrodes mounted in an elastic cap ( Brain Products ) . The electrodes were placed 264 13 according to the international 10 - 20 system , and referenced to FCz during recording . 265 The ground electrode was positioned at the medial frontal aspect . The vertical 266 electrooculograms ( EOG ) was recorded infra - orbitally at the right eye . Impedances 267 were kept below 10 kΩ for all electrodes across all 22 participants included in the 268 analysis : the actual average was 3 . 21 kΩ , within the range 0 - 8 kΩ . The EEG and EOG 269 were amplified by using a band - pass of 0 . 01 - 100Hz and continuously sampled at 270 500Hz / Channel . 271 The EEG data was re - referenced offline to the average of left and right mastoids 272 ( TP9 / TP10 ) . Eye movements were corrected offline . The infinite impulse response 273 ( IIR ) Butterworth Zero Phase Filters were used for low - pass filtering on the 274 continuous data , with a cut - off frequency of 30 Hz and 24 dB / octave roll - off . The 275 EEG data were then notch - filtered at 50Hz . Trials contaminated by large artifacts 276 ( with deflections outside the range of + 80µV ) were excluded before averaging . ERP 277 epochs were extracted with a 200 msec baseline and included 800 msec of 278 post - stimulus onset activity . ERPs were time - locked to the onset of the source 279 character ( the to - be - decomposed character , e . g . , the character “ 夺 ” in the task of “ 大 280 ——夺——寸 ” ) . ERPs on trials with correct answers were averaged separately for 281 each condition . 282 Similar to N2 observed by Mai and colleagues ( 2004 ) and by Qiu and colleagues 283 ( 2006 ) in the insightful riddle task ( the so - called N380 or N320 ) , the pattern and 284 distribution of the N2 deflection exhibited a central midline distribution peaking 285 between 240 msec and 460 msec ( see Figure 2 ) . The authors therefore analyzed N2 286 14 mean amplitude between 240 and 460 msec at the following 25 electrode sites ( F1 , F2 , 287 F3 , F4 , Fz , FC1 , FC2 , FC3 , FC4 , FCz , C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 , Cz , CP1 , CP2 , CP3 , CP4 , CPz , 288 P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , Pz ) . In addition , following Wu and colleagues ( 2013 ) , the authors 289 analyzed mean amplitude of the LPC between 460 - 800 msec at the 13 posterior 290 electrodes ( CP1 , CP2 , CP3 , CP4 , CPz , P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , Pz , PO3 , PO4 , POz ) . There 291 was no evidence of a distinct N400 component occurring in Experiment 1 , and 292 therefore no analysis dedicated specifically to that component . 293 All these ERPs were analyzed using two - way repeated measures analysis of 294 variance ( ANOVA ) with chunk tightness ( two levels : TCD vs . LCD ) and electrode 295 site ( 25 sites for N2 , 13 sites for LPC ) as within - subject factors . Effects with p < . 05 296 were reported to be significant . For any effect with df > 1 , Greenhouse - Geisser 297 correction was used and the value of Epsilon ( ε ) was reported if sphericity assumption 298 was violated ( p < . 05 ) . Bonferroni corrections were used for each of the multiple 299 comparisons . Two types of effect size estimates were given : Classical eta squared ( η² ) 300 for results of two - level ANOVA and partial eta squared ( η p2 ) for ANOVA results of 301 more than two levels . Effect size was reported according to Cohen’s rule of thumb : 302 Cohen ( 1988 ) defined small , medium and large effects as η 2 ( or η p 2 ) values of 02 , . 13 303 and . 26 , respectively . Accordingly , in the current work , effects < = . 02 were labeled as 304 small , effects between . 02 and . 26 as medium , and effects > = . 26 as large . 305 306 FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE 307 2 . 2 . Results 308 15 2 . 2 . 1 . Behavioral results 309 For the filler trials , an accurate response was no response because there was no 310 solution . Filler trial accuracy was 97 % ( 95 % CI = [ 95 % , 100 % ] ) , indicating that 311 participants did not press the button habitual , and did not often guess when there was 312 no solution . 313 A repeated measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) on accuracy in the critical 314 trials showed that participants had significantly lower accuracy in the TCD condition , 315 M = 0 . 86 , 95 % CI = [ . 83 , . 90 ] , than the LCD condition , M = 0 . 98 , 95 % CI = [ . 97 , . 99 ] , 316 F ( 1 , 21 ) = 60 . 48 , p < . 001 , 95 % CI for difference = [ - . 15 , - . 09 ] , with a large effect 317 size , η² = 0 . 74 . In addition , participants took more time to complete the task in the 318 TCD condition , M = 1568 . 46 msec , 95 % CI = [ 1454 . 20 , 1682 . 72 ] , than in the LCD 319 condition , M = 899 . 47 msec , 95 % CI = [ 826 . 85 , 972 . 08 ] , F ( 1 , 21 ) = 259 . 16 , p < . 001 , 320 95 % CI for difference = [ 582 . 57 , 755 . 42 ] , with a large effect size , η² = 0 . 93 . These 321 results indicate that the tight vs . loose chunk manipulation was successful . 322 To determine if character frequency influenced the difficulty of chunk 323 decomposition , the authors computed a Pearson correlation between the frequency of 324 the source character and both reaction time data , and accuracy data .

No interaction 337 between chunk and electrode was found , F < 1 . 338 339 FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE 340 Evidence for distinct effects : Inspection of the grand average waveforms could 341 provoke the concern that the N2 and LPC effects were not distinct . That is , the effects 342 appear to overlap in space and in time . This could occur for several reasons ( see Luck , 343 2014 for several discussions of this issue ) . First , event - related mental processes 344 unfold over time such that later processing is influenced by earlier processing . Second , 345 distinct mental processes can generate ERP components that have similar topological 346 distributions . Third , it is an intrinsic property of the EEG that data points across either 347 space or time will be correlated dependent on proximity . In an attempt to disentangle 348 the significant N2 effect from the LPC effect , the authors did the following work . 349 The authors calculated p - values from a paired t - test of the difference between the 350 TCD and LCD conditions at frontal / central ( F1 , F2 , F3 , F4 , Fz , FC1 , FC2 , FC3 , FC4 , 351 FCz ) , central / parietal ( C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 , Cz , CP1 , CP2 , CP3 , CP4 , CPz ) , and 352 17 parietal / occipital regions ( P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , Pz , PO3 , PO4 , POz , O1 , O2 ) , comparing 353 mean amplitude within a 20 msec sliding window at each time point in the epoch 354 from - 190 msec to 790 msec . Figure 3 shows the p - values plotted across time . 355 Between 200 msec and 300 msec , the difference between TCD and LCD conditions 356 was significant at frontal / central electrodes but not at parietal / occipital electrodes . 357 Further , the later LPC effects were consistently significant at parietal / occipital 358 electrodes , but fell away from significance at frontal / central electrodes beginning at 359 approximately 500 msec . Finally , there was a gap in significant effects between 360 approximately 300 msec and 360 msec indicating that the N2 and LPC effects did not 361 overlap in time . 362 Though there were strong a priori reasons based on previous work ( Mai et al . , 363 2004 ; Qiu et al . , 2006 ) for selecting the electrode groups and time windows for 364 analysis reported above , the p - value plot indicated post hoc that the N2 and LPC were 365 maximally distinct at narrower time windows and more focal topologies . That is , the 366 N2 effect was significant at frontal / central electrodes but not parietal / occipital 367 electrodes between 200 msec and 300 msec and the LPC effect was significant at 368 parietal / occipital electrodes but not at frontal / central electrodes between 700 msec and 369 800 msec . The relevant statistics for these post hoc time - window and electrode 370 groupings are as follows : The post hoc N2 was more negative in the TCD condition , 371 M = 2 . 31 µV , 95 % CI = [ . 71 , 3 . 90 ] , than in the LCD condition , M = 3 . 51 µV , 95 % CI 372 = [ 1 . 70 , 5 . 32 ] , F ( 1 , 21 ) = 4 . 72 , p = . 04 , 95 % CI for difference = [ - 2 . 36 , - . 05 ] , with a 373 medium effect size , η² = . 18 . The post hoc LPC was less positive in the TCD 374 18 condition , M = - 1 . 77 µV , 95 % CI = [ - 2 . 99 , - . 54 ] , than in the LCD condition , M = 1 . 91 375 µV , 95 % CI = [ . 70 , 3 . 12 ] , F ( 1 , 21 ) = 19 . 39 , p < . 001 , 95 % CI for difference = [ - 5 . 41 , 376 - 1 . 94 ] , with a large effect size , η² = . 48 . 377 To further examine the relationship between these two effects , the authors tested 378 for a correlation between the post hoc N2 and LPC effects . The authors quantified the 379 N2 effect by subtracting the mean amplitude of the LCD N2 from the mean amplitude 380 of the TCD N2 between 200 msec and 300 msec across frontal / central electrodes , and 381 the LPC effect by subtracting the mean amplitude of the LCD LPC from the mean 382 amplitude of the TCD LPC between 700 msec and 800 msec across parietal / occipital 383 electrodes . The correlation between effects was not significant , r ( 22 ) = . 394 , p = . 069 , 384 but the p value was close to threshold . Thus , the p - value plot suggests the N2 and 385 LPC effects are distinct , but the correlation does not bolster this interpretation . Taken 386 together , these secondary analyses suggest the authors can tentatively discuss the N2 387 and LPC effects as distinct , but further work is warranted . Experiment 2 returns to this 388 issue . 389 2 . 3 . Discussion for Experiment 1 . 390 The behavioral results show that participants took longer to decompose tight 391 chunks than loose chunks , and made more errors on tight chunks . These results 392 support the hypothesis that perceptual chunk tightness is an important determinant of 393 the difficulty of chunk decomposition . In addition , when compared to loose chunk 394 decomposition , tight chunk decomposition elicits an enhanced N2 ( 240 - 460 msec ) as 395 well as a decreased LPC ( 460 - 800 msec ) . 396 19 Consistent with the predicted effect , the N2 in the TCD condition was larger than 397 in the LCD condition . Previous studies have shown that the fronto - central N2 is 398 sensitive to conflict , with higher amplitude in conflict - inducing tasks , such as in the 399 incongruent condition of an Eriksen flanker task ( Bartholow et al . , 2005 ; Kopp , Rist , 400 & Mattler , 1996 ; Van Veen & Carter , 2002a ) . The fronto - central N2 is generated in the 401 anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , as indicated through source modeling of the N2 402 ( Bocquillon et al . , 2014 ; Van Veen & Carter , 2002a , 2002b ) , and fMRI studies of the 403 flanker task ( Botvinick , Nystrom , Fissell , Carter , & Cohen , 1999 ) . A major theory of 404 the N2 is that N2 reflects conflict detection by the ACC ( Botvinick et al . , 1999 ; 405 Folstein & Van Petten , 2008 ) . However , the N2 wave is also sensitive to difficulty in 406 visual discrimination tasks ( Senkowski & Herrmann , 2002 ) . In the current task , the 407 authors speculate that the N2 reflects the process of recognizing / discriminating the 408 probe inside the source character . The larger N2 amplitude in the TCD condition 409 might indicate high conflict in the process of probe identification , due to interference 410 from the spatially intersecting relationship . The effect would be similar to the 411 increased interference observed in the attentional blink task when distracters appear 412 closer in time to the targets ( Warren , Breuer , Kantner , Fiset , Blais , & Masson , 2009 ) , 413 or when distracters overlap in time with targets ( Nieuwenhuis , Gilzenrat , Holmes & 414 Cohen , 2005 ) . Warren and colleagues ( 2009 ) interpret the interference as neural 415 conflict . 416 Additionally , there was a decreased LPC in the TCD condition relative to the 417 LCD condition . The LPC is sensitive to mental workload ( Kok , 2001 ) . Specifically , 418 20 the amplitude of the LPC decreases as memory load or task demand increases 419 ( Johnson , 1986 ; Kok , 2001 ) . In a chunk decomposition task , once individuals identify 420 the probe , a process of perceptual transformation from one percept ( e . g . , the 421 to - be - removed part ) to another ( e . g . , the to - be - left part ) should occur . Thus , the 422 elicited LPC deflection might index the transformation between perceptual 423 representations , a type of visuo - spatial processing ( Wu et al . , 2013 ) . The decrease in 424 LPC amplitude observed here might reflect difficulty in perceptual transformation 425 caused by chunk tightness ( specifically the spatially intersecting relationship ) , which 426 imposes a greater memory load and requires allocation of more cognitive resources . 427 There are several potentially confounding factors in Experiment 1 . First , the 428 to - be - removed part appears as a probe in a standard form in the first exposure and in a 429 non - standard form ( as part of the source character ) in the second exposure . Thus , 430 sometimes changes in the precise shape of a part between the first and the second 431 exposure occurred . To eliminate such noise in Experiment 2 , the shape of the 432 to - be - removed part held constant across the two exposures ( see the examples in 433 Figure 4 ) . Second , among the possible types of non - intersecting relationships ( vertical 434 offset , horizontal offset , or half - surrounding ) , the probability of each individual type 435 is lower than the probability of the spatially intersecting relationship . Again , 436 Experiment 2 eliminates the source of noise , by controlling differences in the 437 frequencies of the various types of spatial relationships and by using only a vertical 438 offset relationship in the LCD condition . Third , the effect on the elicited N2 in 439 Experiment 1 could overlap with an effect of the classic N400 wave . Generally , 440 21 semantic violations in linguistic processing provoke a N400 component ( Hagoort , 441 Hald , Bastiaansen , & Petersson , 2004 ; Holcomb , 1993 ; Kutas , & Hillyard , 1980 ) . The 442 N400 is also sensitive to conceptual fluency ( Wolk , Schacter , Berman , Holcomb , 443 Daffner , & Budson , 2004 ) . Chinese characters contain semantic information , and thus 444 can elicit N400 deflections ( e . g . , Liu , Perfetti , & Hart , 2003 ) . The time window 445 analyzed for N2 ( 240 - 460 msec ) in Experiment 1 largely overlaps with the time 446 window of the classic N400 ( 300 - 500 msec ) . Further , the well - known repetition 447 priming effect for N400 implies that the second presentation of a word should induce 448 a decreased N400 amplitude ( Kutas & Federmeier , 2000 ; Van Petten , Kutas , Kluender , 449 & Mitchiner , 1991 ) . In the current chunk decomposition task , the participants view a 450 probe , and then must find that probe in the source character . This means the probe 451 repeats and thus could elicit a repetition priming , N400 response . To distinguish the 452 N2 from a potential N400 , Experiment 2 introduces a third condition , in which the 453 to - be - removed part is not actually present in the source character , making it 454 impossible for the participants to obtain a new character ( The third condition serves as 455 a “filler” condition relative to TCD and LCD ) . Previous research indicates that 456 unrepeated characters ( relative to repeated characters ) elicit larger N400 deflections in 457 a Chinese character matching task ( Wang , Huang , & Mao , 2009 ) . Considering that a 458 matching or identification process is needed when looking for the to - be - removed part 459 in the current character decomposition task , the third ( filler ) condition should elicit a 460 standard N400 , serving as a reference for differentiating between the N2 effect and a 461 potential subsequent N400 effect . 462 22 The authors conducted the primary ERP analysis in Experiment 1 using a priori 463 time windows based on previous work ( Mai et al . , 2004 ; Qiu et al . , 2006 ) . However , 464 these time windows did not appear to capture distinct effects . A secondary analysis 465 characterizing the effects across time and space indicated that the significant effect of 466 chunk tightness was separated across both space ( frontal - central vs . parietal - occipital ) 467 and time ( no significant effects between ~ 300 msec and 360 msec ) ( see Figure 3 ) . 468 However , a correlational analysis using post hoc time windows guided by the data 469 suggested that the frontal / central N2 effect between 200 msec and 300 msec and the 470 LPC effect between 700 msec and 800 msec were closely , if not significantly , related . 471 The authors performed the same set of analyses in Experiment 2 to address this issue 472 further . 473 3 . Experiment 2 474 The aim and task of Experiment 2 were the same as Experiment 1 with the main 475 difference that the fillers serve not only to reduce and assess rates of guessing , but 476 also as a control condition for the comparison with the critical conditions ( TCD and 477 LCD ) . The amount of trials was equivalent across three decomposition conditions or 478 levels ( TCD vs . LCD vs . fillers / “not” ) for final ERP analysis and comparisons . 479 3 . 1 . Methods 480 3 . 1 . 1 . Participants 481 Selection and consent procedures for a new group of 24 participants ( 12 males ; 482 mean age = 23 . 6 , 95 % CI = [ 22 . 53 , 24 . 72 ] ) , were identical to Experiment 1 , as was 483 the compensation with a small honorarium ( ¥ 30 Yuan ) . No volunteer from 484 23 Experiment 1 participated in Experiment 2 . 485 3 . 1 . 2 . Stimuli 486 Stimuli were the same as those in Experiment 1 with the following exceptions . 487 First , there were forty trials in the TCD and LCD conditions , respectively . Second , the 488 to - be - removed parts and the to - be - left parts were always in a relationship of vertical 489 offset in the source character for the LCD condition ( see the examples in Figure 4 ) . 490 Third , 40 new source characters , each composed of a to - be - removed part and the 491 to - be - left part , were collected for the filler condition . These characters were separated 492 in order to be randomly regrouped with other characters in any given trial . For 493 example , the character “ 禾 ” from “ 秀 ” , the character “ 正 ” from “ 歪 ” and the 494 character “ 舍 ” can make up a catch trial , in which participants cannot find “ 禾 ” 495 within the source character “ 舍 ” , and thus cannot remove “ 禾 ” to get the target 496 character “ 正 ” . Fourth , the average stroke number was computed among the three 497 conditions ( the filler / control condition , the TCD condition , the LCD condition ) in an 498 attempt to limit variability in stroke number across conditions . The average stroke 499 number of the probes were 2 . 85 , 3 . 05 , 3 . 05 , which did not differ significantly , F ( 2 , 500 117 ) = . 28 , p = . 76 . The average stroke number of the source character was 6 . 075 , 501 6 . 65 , 6 . 65 , which also did not differ significantly , F ( 2 , 117 ) = 1 . 23 , p = . 30 . The 502 average stroke number of the target also did not differ , ( 3 . 35 , 3 . 6 , 3 . 6 ) , F ( 2 , 117 ) 503 = . 38 , p = . 68 . Fifth , the new characters exhibited a significant difference in frequency 504 of use in the Chinese language between the TCD ( M±SD : ( . 0779 ± . 1204 ) % ) and the 505 LCD ( M±SD : ( . 0206 ± . 0227 ) % ) , F ( 1 , 78 ) = 8 . 77 , p = . 004 , η ² = . 101 conditions 506 24 ( character frequency was statistically referenced by www . cncorpus . org ) . This 507 difference in character frequency was unintentional , but as reported in the behavioral 508 results , character frequency differences did not appear to produce any behavioral 509 differences across conditions . No other changes were made to the stimuli , and the size 510 of the stimuli was the same as in Experiment 1 ( subtending 3 . 3 ╳ 3 . 3° of visual 511 angle ) . 512 513 FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE 514 3 . 1 . 3 . Procedure and task 515 The procedure and task in Experiment 2 were the same as the procedure and task 516 in Experiment 1 except that the durations of the source character and the left character 517 were adjusted to 3 seconds and 2 seconds , respectively , in light of the average 518 response times in Experiment 1 . The 120 trials ( 40 trials in the TCD condition , 40 519 trials in the LCD condition and 40 filler trials ) were presented in a randomized order 520 in each block . Participants were given a break every 40 trials . There were 12 practice 521 trials before the formal experiment . 522 3 . 1 . 4 . ERP recordings and analysis 523 The ERP recordings and the pre - processing steps of ERP data from 524 re - referencing to grand averaging was the same as Experiment 1 . The impedances of 525 all electrodes were kept below 10 kΩ : the actual average was 2 . 86 kΩ , ( range 0 - 7 526 kΩ ) . 527 The time ranges analyzed were different between Experiment 1 and 2 , to allow 528 25 for independent analysis of the N400 . The N2 was analyzed between 260 - 360 msec , 529 the N400 in a 360 - 460 msec time window , and the LPC was analyzed during the same 530 time window as Experiment 1 , 460 to 800 msec ( see Figure 5 and 6 ) . The mean 531 amplitude of N2 was measured at the same 25 electrodes as in Experiment 1 , and the 532 N400 was analyzed at the same electrodes as the N2 . The mean amplitude of LPC was 533 measured at the same 13 electrodes as in Experiment 1 . One final difference in 534 analysis between Experiment 1 and 2 was that in Experiment 2 , the ERPs to the filler 535 condition were included as third level of the chunk tightness factor in the omnibus 536 ANOVA . 537 3 . 2 . Results 538 3 . 2 . 1 . Behavioral results 539 The percentage of correct no - responses in the filler condition was 96 % ( 95 % CI 540 = [ 94 % , 97 % ] ) , indicating again that participants did not guess when there was not an 541 apparent solution . Participants had lower accuracy in the TCD condition , M = . 89 , 542 95 % CI = [ . 85 , . 92 ] , than the LCD condition , M = . 98 , 95 % CI = [ . 97 , . 99 ] , F ( 1 , 23 ) = 543 34 . 76 , p < . 001 , 95 % CI for difference = [ - . 13 , - . 09 ] , with a large effect size , η² = . 62 . 544 In addition , participants took more time to complete the task in the TCD condition , M 545 = 1436 . 43 msec , 95 % CI = [ 1355 . 20 , 1517 . 66 ] than in the LCD condition , M = 916 . 95 546 msec , 95 % CI = [ 858 . 68 , 975 . 21 ] , F ( 1 , 23 ) = 421 . 34 , p < . 001 , 95 % CI for difference 547 = [ 467 . 13 , 571 . 83 ] , with a large effect size , η² = . 95 . 548 Character frequency did not appear to influence chunk decomposition difficulty . 549 Pearson correlations indicated no significant correlation between frequency and 550 26 reaction times : r ( 80 ) = . 038 , p = . 738 , nor between frequency and accuracy : r ( 80 ) = 551 - . 006 , p = . 961 . 552 3 . 2 . 2 .

In 597 addition , the N2 effect began later in Experiment 2 ( ~ 300 msec ) and extended for a 598 longer period of time ( approximately 200 msec ) . This may be the spatial and temporal 599 overlap between the N2 and N400 effects , potentially provoked by including the filler 600 condition in Experiment 2 , or perhaps by other small differences , including the use of 601 different participants . 602 The p - value plot for experiment 2 suggested the N2 did not begin until 300 msec . 603 In addition , the LPC effect showed spatial specificity between 600 msec and 800 604 msec . To continue the examination of the relationship between the N2 and LPC 605 effects begun in Experiment 1 , the authors analyzed the post hoc N2 at frontal / central 606 electrodes between 300msec and 400 msec , and the post hoc LPC at parietal / occipital 607 electrodes between 600 msec and 800 msec . The post hoc N2 was more negative in 608 the TCD condition , M = 1 . 55 µV , 95 % CI = [ - . 57 , 3 . 68 ] , than in the LCD condition , M 609 = 4 . 00 µV , 95 % CI = [ 2 . 00 , 6 . 01 ] , F ( 1 , 23 ) = 17 . 23 , p < . 001 , 95 % CI for difference = 610 [ - 3 . 67 , - 1 . 23 ] , with a large effect size , η² = . 43 .

As in Experiment 1 , the 614 authors quantified the post hoc N2 and LPC effects in these maximally distinct 615 time - window / electrode - grouping combinations by subtracting the LCD values from 616 29 the TCD values . The correlation between post hoc N2 and LPC effects was not 617 significant , r ( 24 ) = . 250 , p = . 239 . This non - significant effect does not prove the 618 effects are distinct , but continued , cautious interpretation along these lines seems 619 appropriate . 620 3 . 3 . Discussion for Experiment 2 621 Experiment 1 primarily investigated the role of chunk tightness in chunk 622 decomposition , by comparing the TCD and LCD conditions . Experiment 2 added the 623 filler condition to the statistical analysis , giving three decomposition levels ( TCD vs . 624 LCD vs . filler ) . In addition , the primary negative - going deflection in Experiment 1 625 was divided into an N2 ( 260 - 360 msec ) and an N400 ( 360 - 460 msec ) for 626 measurement and analysis in Experiment 2 . 627 The ERPs results of Experiment 2 show characteristic differences in the pattern 628 of sensitivity across conditions , dissociating these components . The N2 was sensitive 629 to the difference between tight and loose chunks , but not between loose chunks and 630 the filler condition . The N400 was sensitive to the difficulty of finding the probe , but 631 not to the difference between a difficult probe identification , and no probe 632 identification in the filler condition . The LPC effect was distinctive from the N2 and 633 N400 effects by virtue of being sensitive to the differences between all three 634 conditions . 635 Experiment 2 replicated the N2 effect seen in Experiment 1 , in that the TCD 636 condition elicits a larger N2 than the LCD condition , even when the shape of the 637 probe is kept rigorously constant and the spatial offset between the to - be - removed 638 30 part and the target character is always vertical in the LCD condition . 639 In Experiment 2 the filler condition elicited an N400 , representative of the N400 640 repetition effect , in which a non - repetition condition elicits a larger N400 than a 641 repetition condition ( Kutas & Federmeier , 2000 ; Van Petten et al . , 1991 ; Wang et al . , 642 2009 ) . The observed N400 in the filler condition might reflect a semantic violation 643 that occurs when participants cannot find the target character within the source 644 character . With the N400 elicited in the filler condition taken as reference , there is an 645 enhanced N400 - like deflection ( N360 - 460 ) in the TCD ( vs . LCD ) condition , 646 following the N2 ( N260 - 360 ) . However , there is no significant difference in N400 647 amplitude between the TCD condition and the filler condition , suggesting that the 648 neural activity associated with searching for the solution in the TCD condition is 649 similar to activity associated with failing to find the probe stimulus within the source 650 character , even though the accuracy data indicates that participants typically do find 651 the solution . 652 As an interim summary , the N2 effect , the N400 effect , and the LPC effect 653 together seem to index multiple stages of chunk decomposition . The N2 seems to 654 reflect neural conflict or interference associated with identifying the probe in 655 crossed - relation with the target . The N400 effect then reflects the ongoing difficulty 656 of mentally extracting the probe when it is firmly embedded or not at all present in the 657 source character , relative to the easier , LCD condition . Finally , the LPC effect seems 658 to index the last stage of the mental task , when subjects have either realized there is 659 no solution ( largest LPC to the filler condition ) , are solving the solution easily 660 31 ( intermediate LPC ) , or are having greater difficulty performing the final visuo - spatial 661 transformation associated with the solution ( smallest LPC ) . 662 4 . General discussion 663 This work investigated the temporal course of neural activity associated with 664 insight - based problem solving in a chunk decomposition task , revealing that the N2 665 and LPC ( Experiment 1 and 2 ) , and the N400 ( Experiment 2 ) are all sensitive to 666 the difficulty of chunk decomposition . Each of these ERP components have a 667 unique sensitivity to our manipulation , allowing speculation on the progress of 668 problem solving in the task from early to late stages . In addition , what is already 669 known about each of these components can be leveraged to suggest what cognitive 670 process is occurring during each window of time . 671 4 . 1 . Different roles of spatial intersection and element type in chunk 672 decomposition 673 Interestingly , the pattern of LPC deflection in the current study is completely 674 different from the pattern observed by Wu and colleagues ( 2013 ) , in which the LPC 675 deflection was larger during tight chunk decomposition than during loose chunk 676 decomposition . The different results must be due to the different ways of 677 manipulating chunk tightness between the current work , and the study of Wu and 678 colleagues . Wu and colleagues used a conceptual manipulation of chunk tightness 679 based on whether the to - be - removed component had independent meaning or not , 680 Conceptual manipulations of chunk tightness have a smaller effect on chunk 681 decomposition difficulty than perceptual manipulations ( Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . In 682 32 contrast , the current study uses a perceptual manipulation of chunk tightness whereby 683 tight chunks have spatially overlapping components and loose chunks do not . It is 684 reasonable to suggest that these two different manipulations of chunk tightness might 685 influence chunk decomposition through different mechanisms . Such a proposal still 686 needs to be tested , given that neither study compared the neural underpinnings of 687 perceptual and conceptual manipulations of chunk tightness directly . 688 4 . 2 . Two - phase difficulties of insight problem solving 689 The observed time course of ERP effects ( N2 , N400 , and LPC ) in the current 690 work support a preliminary model of insight problem solving during Chinese 691 character decomposition ( see Figure 8 ) . The model suggests two essential phases : an 692 identification process and a transformation process . In the model , perceptual chunk 693 tightness causes the difficulty of both probe identification and perceptual 694 transformation . 695 696 FIGURE 8 ABOUT HERE 697 In the first phase , individuals have to recognize the key element of a perceptual 698 chunk . The first step serves as an initiation probe for the decomposition of a 699 perceptual chunk . The ERP data exhibit sensitivity to the difficulty of identification in 700 the consecutive N2 - N400 waves . The enhanced amplitude of N2 indicates greater 701 conflict in the TCD condition . Subsequently , the enhanced N400 deflection indicates 702 greater semantic violation in the TCD condition and the filler condition , compared to 703 the LCD condition . The difficulty in identification causes both the conflict - related N2 704 33 effect and the semantic violation N400 effect . 705 The second phase involves the transformation of the perceptual representation . In 706 the second phase , the hierarchical pattern of LPC amplitudes across the three 707 conditions ( TCD < LCD < filler ) provides evidence for the difficulty of 708 transformation hypothesis . The LPC reflects a process of perceptual transformation 709 ( Wu et al . , 2013 ) from an old perceptual element to a new one ( the target character ) . 710 As the difficulty of transformation increases , associated demands such as memory 711 load increase , which results in a decrease in LPC amplitude ( Johnson , 1986 ; Kok , 712 2001 ) . Further , the difficulty of perceptual transformation contributes to poor 713 behavioral performance , as an additional correlation analysis ( by combining data from 714 both experiments ) indicates that there was a significant negative correlation between 715 LPC amplitude values and response times [ r ( 92 ) = - . 290 , p = . 005 ] . 716 4 . 3 . Conflict detection and resolution in creative insight : Implications of early 717 ERP negativity ( N2 ) and late ERP positivity ( LPC ) effects . 718 A leading theory of the N2 is that N2 reflects conflict detection by the ACC ( e . g . , 719 Botvinick et al . , 1999 ; Coderre , Conklin , & van Heuven , 2011 ; Folstein & Van Petten , 720 2008 ) . The conflict is due to simultaneous activation of incompatible representations 721 ( Botvinick et al . 1999 ) . The N2 effect observed here supports the view that conflict 722 detection and resolution play essential roles in creative insight , particularly in 723 breaking an impasse ( Laukkonen & Tangen , 2017 ; Zhao et al . , 2014 ) . The cause of 724 impasse is ineffective mental representations ( experience - based constraints or 725 constraints imposed by biases in the perceptual system ) . These mental representations 726 34 interfere with the process of finding the solution ( Zhao et al . , 2014 ) . The interference 727 might provoke the neural conflict associated with the N2 , and conflict detection may 728 be the impetus for abandoning the ineffective mental representation . Such an 729 interpretation is supported by studies of other insight problem solving tasks that also 730 report a larger N2 and / or greater ACC activity in more difficult problems . For 731 example , many studies of insight problem solving have found an increased N2 when 732 the solution required the breaking of experience - based constraints ( Luo et al . , 2011 ; 733 Mai et al . , 2004 ; Qiu et al . , 2006 ; Zhao et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ; Xing , Zhang , 734 & Zhang , 2012 ) . Dipole source analysis in two of these studies suggested that the 735 generator of the N2 was located in the ACC ( Mai et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . In 736 addition , fMRI studies have observed strong ACC activation in solving verbal 737 problems of insight , such as Chinese riddles ( Luo , Niki , & Phillips , 2004 ) , the RAT 738 task ( Subramaniam et al . , 2009 ) , and the anagram task ( Aziz - Zadeh et al . , 2009 ) . 739 Finally , researchers have observed greater ACC activity in other chunk decomposition 740 tasks for conceptually tight chunks versus conceptually loose chunks ( Wu et al . , 741 2013 ) . 742 The LPC effect may reflect conflict resolution during the breaking of the impasse 743 in these kinds of problems . LPC , has been associated with conflict resolution in the 744 Stroop task ( Appelbaum , Boehler , Davis , Won , & Woldorff , 2014 ; Coderre et al . , 2011 ; 745 Xiang , Wang , & Zhang , 2013 ; West , 2003 ) . During insight problem solving , detecting 746 conflict alone is not sufficient for breaking the impasse . As Qiu et al . ( 2006 ) show in a 747 Chinese riddle task , both the unsolved condition and the insight condition elicited 748 35 greater N2 - like deflections than the non - insight condition . Thus , the N2 is not 749 predictive of finding the solution , such that resolving the conflict is necessary as well 750 ( Zhao et al . , 2014 ) . Accumulating work has provided evidence that LPC might 751 function as an index of conflict resolution when breaking the impasse caused by 752 experience - based constraints . Several studies have observed LPC effects following 753 N2 effects ( Xing et al . , 2012 ; Zhao et al . , 2014 ) , Wang and colleagues ( 2009 ) found 754 additional positive deflections ( P300 - 800 and P1200 - 1500 ) over parietal - occipital 755 regions , together with additional negative deflections ( N300 - 800 and N1200 - 1500 ) 756 over fronto - central regions . Similarly , Luo et al . ( 2011 ) found a greater P900 - 1700 757 ( insight vs . non - insight ) accompanied by early negative deflections ( N300 - 500 and 758 N1100 - 1300 ) . Concomitant with the conflict - detecting negativity , the LPC might 759 reflect conflict resolution as an index of activation of the answer ( Zhao et al . , 2014 ) , 760 or as an index of the formation of new associations ( Luo et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 761 2009 ; Xing et al . , 2012 ) . 762 4 . 4 . Limitations and future directions 763 The interpretation offered here of findings presented in the current work should be 764 tempered by several considerations . First , though the N2 findings in the current and 765 other work support the involvement of conflict detection in breaking an impasse 766 during insight problem solving , there has been some inconsistent work . For example , 767 Zhang et al . ( 2011 ) found a P400 - 600 effect associated with insight solutions ( vs . 768 search solution ) in a Chinese anagram task and argued that the P400 - 600 reflected the 769 breaking of mental set . Zhang and colleagues did not find an N2 effect in that study . 770 36 Similarly , Zhao et al . ( 2011 ) found a P500 - 700 deflection associated with breaking an 771 impasse and no N2 effect . Second , in contrast to the many important papers linking 772 the N2 to conflict detection , the link between conflict resolution and the LPC has not 773 yet received abundant support ( Appelbaum et al . , 2014 ; Coderre et al . , 2011 ) . In fact , 774 some have suggested that LPC might reflect semantic processing ( e . g . , Liotti et al . , 775 2000 ) . Thus , the account of conflict deflection and resolution on creative insight calls 776 on more empirical examinations in the future . 777 There are some methodological limitations that should be noted here as well . 778 First , though the authors carefully handled channel selection and time window 779 definition according to the experimental observations and previous studies , more 780 objective data - driven methods ( e . g . , principle components analysis ) have been 781 encouraged for ERP analysis ( Dien , 2012 ; Dien , Beal , & Berg . , 2005 ) . 782 Second , the ANOVA analysis for Experiment 2 included the ERP results from the 783 filler / control condition , which was important for testing specific claims , but raises the 784 concern that the filler may not have been an appropriate control condition . The filler 785 condition can be regarded as not requiring decomposition , in that the task only 786 involves searching for the probe , not identification or perceptual transformation ( i . e . , 787 transformation from the to - be - removed part to the to - be - left part ) . Thus , the LPC 788 result for the filler condition may not be able to provide sufficient information to 789 explain the difficulty of perceptual transformation . In this regard , future studies could 790 examine a wider variety of control conditions . For example , for conditions not 791 involving decomposition , researchers could use at least two types of control : a control 792 37 condition in which the participants cannot find the probe ( the to - be - removed part ) 793 within the source character , so that decomposition does not occur , coupled with a 794 control condition in which participants can find the probe but cannot use it to create a 795 valid character . In this way , researchers could isolate the ERP activity associated with 796 specific task phases ( probe identification or perceptual transformation ) . Another 797 consideration is that future researchers could construct a three - level parametric design 798 for chunk tightness : high vs . middle vs . low ( loosest ) . In this way , researchers could 799 get deeper insight into how the ERPs change incrementally with changes in chunk 800 tightness . 801 Finally , though this study reveals consistent ERP effects across the two 802 experiments , the ERP patterns are inconsistent to some degree . For instance , the slope 803 of LPC is steep in Experiment 1 but not steep in Experiment 2 , appearing more 804 similar to a long - lasting P3b in Experiment 2 . The LPC and P3b ( as well as N400 ) 805 overlap in time but might be functionally dissociable ( Misra & Holcomb , 2003 ; 806 Olichney , Yang , Taylor , & Kutas , 2011 ) . Some factors differing between experiments 807 might affect LPC as well as overlapping components ( P3b or N400 ) making it 808 difficult to attribute specific effects to the LPC alone . 809 One factor that differed between experiments was character frequency ( character 810 frequency of use in the Chinese language ) . Whereas Experiment 1 controlled 811 character frequency across the two chunk tightness conditions , Experiment 2 did not 812 control the character frequency . However , the concern that character frequency 813 confounded effects in Experiment 2 can be mitigated by considering that high 814 38 frequency ( vs . low frequency ) words induce a smaller N400 ( Rugg , 1990 ) , as well as 815 larger P300 ( Polich & Donchin , 1988 ) , a pattern opposite to that observed in the 816 current study . 817 The other two factors that differed between Experiment 1 and 2 were shape 818 change and stimuli probability . Experiment 1 did not control either factor , but 819 Experiment 2 controlled both . It is possible that the difference in experimental control 820 exerted over shape change and stimulus probability between experiments caused some 821 differences in the ERPs between experiments ( e . g . , the LPC amplitude ) . Nevertheless , 822 the main findings concerning the N2 and LPC were replicated between experiments . 823 In conclusion , the current study found increased amplitude of the consecutive 824 N2 - N400 wave and decreased amplitude of the LPC for tight ( vs . loose ) chunk 825 decomposition . The behavioral and ERP results support the hypothesis that chunk 826 tightness associated with spatial intersection causes the difficulty in insight problem 827 solving by increasing neural conflict and requiring greater mental resources for 828 visuo - spatial transformation . 829 Acknowledgements 830 This work was improved greatly through the review process and we wish to express 831 our gratitude to the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions . 832 This work was supported by MOE ( Ministry of Education in China ) Youth Project of 833 Humanities and Social Sciences ( 18YJC190033 ) ; the National Natural Science 834 Foundation of China ( 31571153 , 31671150 , 31571144 ) ; the Guangdong province 835 colleges and universities innovation team construction project ( 2015KCXTD009 ) ; the 836 Shenzhen Fundamental Research Projects ( JCYJ20150729104249783 ) ; the “12th 837 Five - Year plan” of Guangzhou Education Science ( 1201421342 ) ; and the Scientific 838 Research Startup Project ( 27000503138 ) . 839 39 References 840 Appelbaum , L . , Boehler , C . , Davis , L . , Won , R . , & Woldorff , M .
