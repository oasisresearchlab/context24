In the process of macropinosome formation , localized productions of phosphoinositides such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 spatiotemporally orchestrate actin polymerization and rearrangement through recruiting and activating a variety of actin - associated proteins . In addition , the sequential activation of small GTPases , which are known to be master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton , plays a pivotal role in parallel with phosphoinositides . To complete macropinosome formation , phosphoinositide breakdown and Rho GTPase deactivation must occur in appropriate timings . After the nascent macropinosomes are formed , phosphoinositides and several Rab GTPases control macropinosome maturation by regulating vesicle trafﬁcking and membrane fusion . In this review , we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the critical functions of phosphoinositide metabolism and small GTPases in association with their downstream effectors in macropinocytosis . Keywords : macropinocytosis , small GTPases , phosphoinositides , Rac1 , optogenetics , myotubularin - related proteins INTRODUCTION Macropinocytosis , an actin - dependent endocytic pathway , leads to the nonselective ingestion of extracellular ﬂuid containing nutrients , antigens , and other molecules into cells . The process was ﬁrst reported as pinocytosis ( drinking by cells ) by Warren H . Lewis using the earliest live - cell imaging technique , ﬁlmed time - lapse cinephotography ( Lewis , 1931 ) . Macropinocytosis , which forms large ( > 0 . 2 – 5 μ m ) endocytic vacuoles called macropinosomes , was later distinguished from micropinocyto - sis , which is mediated by smaller vesicles ( ∼ 100 nm ) such as clathrin - coated vesicles ( Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) . Compared with the mechanisms of receptor - mediated endocytosis through clathrin - coated vesicles , those of macropinocytosis have been studied less intensively in previous years . However , macropinocy - tosis has recently attracted increasing attention , as the important physiological and pathological implications of this process have been successively uncovered in a broad range of cell types . In macrophages and dendritic cells , exogenous proteins that are internalized through macropinocytosis are processed and pre - sented as antigen peptides on the class II major histocompati - bility complex ( MHC ) ( Sallusto et al . , 1995 ) . In connection with pathogenesis , macrophage foam cell formation in atherosclerotic plaques can occur through the macropinocytic uptake of native low - density lipoproteins ( Kruth et al . , 2005 ) . The macropinocy - tosis of proteins in cancer cells is a pivotal amino acid supply route for tumor growth ( Commisso et al . , 2013 ) . In neuronal cells , macropinocytosis - mediated massive retrieval of the plasma membrane is an important mechanism of growth cone col - lapse and axon growth inhibition ( Kabayama et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) . Paradoxically , numerous infectious pathogens , such as bacteria , viruses , protozoa , and prions , utilize macropinocytosis for their internalization into host cells ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 , 2012 ; Lim and Gleeson , 2011 ) . Salmonella typhimurium induces mem - brane rufﬂing and macropinocytosis , which ultimately directs the internalization of the species into spacious phagosomes in host cells ( Garcia - del Portillo and Finlay , 1994 ; Alpuche - Aranda et al . , 1995 ) . These organelles can be considered as similar to macropinosomes in the context of their formation mechanism . A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying macropinocytosis , which serves several distinct purposes in dif - ferent cell types , would provide new insights into a wide range of pathologies and human health issues . The process of macropinocytosis begins with actin - driven plasma membrane rufﬂing . Although many rufﬂes recede soon after formation , some sheet - like rufﬂes turn into cup - shaped circular rufﬂes ( macropinocytic cups ) . Then , closure of the cup opening results in the formation of intracellular macropinosomes . Subsequently , newly formed macropinosomes undergo a process of maturation for degradation or recycling . The two key events of macropinocytosis , macropinosome for - mation and maturation , are mediated by the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafﬁcking , which are primarily controlled by www . frontiersin . org September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 374 | 1 Egami et al . GTPases and phosphoinositides in macropinocytosis small GTPases and phosphoinositides ( Araki et al . , 2000 ; Cardelli , 2001 ; Swanson , 2008 ; Kerr and Teasdale , 2009 ; Lim and Gleeson , 2011 ) . In this review , we summarize the regulatory relevance of small GTPase and phosphoinositide metabolism to macropinocy - tosis and introduce our recent ﬁndings on the implications of myotubularin - related proteins ( MTMRs ) in phosphoinositide metabolism during macropinosome formation . SMALL GTPases Small GTPases of the Ras superfamily consist of several sub - families , including the Ras , Rho , ADP ribosylation factor ( Arf ) , and Rab GTPases , all of which are key regulators in the sig - naling pathways that control diverse cellular and developmental events such as differentiation , cell division , vesicle transport , nuclear assembly , and cytoskeletal organization . These GTPases are known to serve as molecular switches and regulate the pro - cess of macropinocytosis . In this section , we describe the current knowledge of the regulatory implications of each small GTPase family in macropinocytosis . Rho GTPases Rho family GTPases , which act as molecular switches , regulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling through cycling between an active , GTP - bound form and inactive , GDP - bound form ( Ridley , 2006 ) . Changes in the actin cytoskeleton drive many dynamic aspects of cell behavior , including morphogenesis , migration , cytokine - sis , phagocytosis , and macropinocytosis . Rho GTPases encompass three groups of proteins , Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 , which differ - entially regulate actin - based cell structures . Typically , Rho is involved in the formation of focal adhesion and stress ﬁbers , Rac forms lamellipodia and / or membrane rufﬂes , and Cdc42 forms ﬁlopodia ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Hall , 1998 ; Hall and Nobes , 2000 ) . In the process of macropinocytosis , Rac1 is crucial for membrane rufﬂing and macropinosome formation in a variety of different cell types , including dendrite cells , macrophages , ﬁbrob - lasts , and epithelial cells . Furthermore , we have recently revealed that the deactivation of Rac1 following its transient activation is also required for macropinosome formation ( Fujii et al . , 2013 ) . We show these data later in a separate subsection . Cdc42 activation has also been shown in some cell types during macropinocytosis , although its necessity to macropinocy - tosis has not been established ( Patel and Galán , 2006 ) . In bone marrow – derived mouse dendritic cells , the microinjection of GDP - bound inactive Rac1 - T17N or treatment with Clostridium difﬁcile toxin B , which inhibits all Rho GTPases ( including Rac and Cdc42 ) , abrogates membrane rufﬂing and macropinocy - tosis , whereas inactive Cdc42 does not affect macropinocyto - sis ( West et al . , 2000 ) . GTP - bound Rac1 and Cdc42 activate p21 - activated kinase 1 ( PAK1 ) , which is essential for ruf - ﬂing and macropinosome formation ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 2000 ) . PAK1 regulates actin cytoskeleton organization through WASP / WAVE - Arp2 / 3 activation and also phosphorylates the C - terminal - binding protein - 1 / Brefeldin A - ADP – ribosylated sub - strate ( CtBP1 / BARS ) , which is essential for the ﬁssion of macropinosomes from the plasma membrane ( Liberali et al . , 2008 ) . Although the precise roles of Rho isoforms in macropinocy - tosis remain unclear , the implications of some Rho isoforms in the process have been reported . Higher vertebrates possess three major Rho isoforms , RhoA , RhoB , and RhoC , which share 85 % amino acid sequence identity . RhoA and RhoC GTPases share 92 % amino acid sequence identity ; however , they show dif - ferent activity dynamics during macropinocytosis . Using FRET microscopy with a RhoC biosensor , RhoC was shown to be tem - porally activated at the circular rufﬂes prior to macropinosome closure ( Zawistowski et al . , 2013 ) , while a burst of RhoA activ - ity was observed after macropinosome closure in ﬁbroblasts ( Pertz et al . , 2006 ; Zawistowski et al . , 2013 ) . Unlike RhoA and RhoC , RhoB localizes to intracellular endosomes and controls vesicle transport through regulating actin assembly on vesicle membranes ( Fernandez - Borja et al . , 2005 ) ; however , the spe - ciﬁc contribution of RhoB to macropinosomes has not yet been determined . Additionally , RNAi knockdown and overexpression experiments have suggested that RhoG , a close homolog of Rac1 , is required for the formation of dorsal membrane ruf - ﬂes during growth factor - induced macropinocytosis in ﬁbrob - lasts and A431 cells ( Ellerbroek et al . , 2004 ; Samson et al . , 2010 ) . Ras GTPases The involvement of Ras in membrane rufﬂing and macropinocy - tosis has been reported in several cell types ( Bar - Sagi and Feramisco , 1986 ; Porat - Shliom et al . , 2008 ; Welliver and Swanson , 2012 ) . H - Ras localizes to membrane rufﬂes and forms macropinosomes in epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - stimulated HeLa and COS - 7 cells , and the G12V active mutant of H - Ras induces membrane rufﬂing and macropinocytosis ( Porat - Shliom et al . , 2008 ) . In RAW macrophages , Ras activation , as measured by ratio imaging of the citrine - Ras - binding domain ( RBD ) , is observed after circular rufﬂe formation and is approximately con - current with Rab5 recruitment during macropinocytosis . The peak of Ras activity occurs slightly after cup closure ( Welliver and Swanson , 2012 ) . Arf GTPases The Arf family of proteins comprises another group of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases . Arf small GTPases are known to regulate membrane trafﬁcking events , including phagocy - tosis and macropinocytosis , through modulating phospholipid metabolism and the actin cytoskeleton . Arf6 and Arf1 , two of the best - characterized Arf proteins , have been implicated in membrane rufﬂing and macropinocytosis ( Radhakrishna et al . , 1996 , 1999 ; Zhang et al . , 1999 ; Schafer et al . , 2000 ; Grimmer et al . , 2002 ) . It has been suggested that Arf6 is required for the localization of activated Rac1 to the plasma mem - brane . When Salmonella invades host cells through inducing macropinocytosis , Arf6 triggers actin assembly through recruit - ing ARNO , an Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) , which activates Arf1 to enable the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) ( Humphreys et al . , 2013 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production by phos - phatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase α ( PI4P5K α ) is stimu - lated through the cooperation of Arf6 and Rac1 in membrane rufﬂe formation ( Honda et al . , 1999 ) . Additionally , biochem - ical analysis has shown that Arf6 activates phospholipase D1 , which is required for macropinosome formation ( Haga et al . , 2009 ) . Frontiers in Physiology | Membrane Physiology and Membrane Biophysics September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 374 | 2 Egami et al . GTPases and phosphoinositides in macropinocytosis Rab GTPases Rab GTPases are key regulators of membrane trafﬁcking in endo - cytic pathways ( Somsel Rodman and Wandinger - Ness , 2000 ; Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . To date , more than 60 members of the Rab family have been identiﬁed in the human genome ( Colicelli , 2004 ) . Many of the Rab proteins that are localized on distinct intracellular vesicles have been reported to coordinate sequential steps of membrane transport ( Schwartz et al . , 2007 ) . In the macropinocytic pathway , several Rab GTPases have been shown to be involved in macropinosome formation or subse - quent macropinosome maturation . Live - cell imaging analysis and experiments with dominant - negative mutants and RNAi have revealed that Rab5 and Rab34 are involved in macropinosome formation . Porat - Shliom et al . showed that the recruitment of Rab5 to the plasma membrane overlaps with the production of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) in COS - 7 cells expressing H - Ras - G12V ( GTP - bound form ) ( Porat - Shliom et al . , 2008 ) . In MEF cells stimulated with platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , the expression of Rab5 - S34N ( GDP - bound form ) inhibits the induction of circular rufﬂes ( macropinocytic cups ) , which are the precursors of macropinosomes ( Lanzetti et al . , 2004 ) . Rab5 is recruited to macropinocytic cups together with RN - tre , a Rab5 GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) and Rab5 effec - tor , which mediates actin remodeling . Supporting the involve - ment of Rab5 in macropinosome formation , the expression of Rabankyrin - 5 , another Rab5 effector , promotes ﬂuid - phase uptake in EGF - treated A431 cells ( Schnatwinkel et al . , 2004 ) . FRET microscopy has shown that Rab5a activation follows imme - diately after its recruitment to nascent macropinosomes in growth factor – stimulated COS - 7 cells and macrophages . Rab5a activ - ity increases temporally in early macropinosomes and then decreases prior to its dissociation . The overexpression of activat - ing and inhibitory proteins indicates that active Rab5a stabilizes macropinosomes ( Feliciano et al . , 2011 ) . During macropinocytosis , Rab34 is also associated with actin - rich membrane rufﬂes and regulates macropinosome formation . In mouse embryo ﬁbroblast ( C3H 10T1 / 2 ) cells , Rab34 - mediated macropinocytosis requires the activity of Rac1 and the actin nucleation factor WAVE2 ( Sun et al . , 2003 ) . However , when Coxa virus enter human intestinal epithelial Caco - 2 cells through macropinocytic activity , Rab34 - mediateded macropinocytosis is dependent on Ras but not Rac1 ( Coyne et al . , 2007 ) . In the process of macropinosome maturation , internalized macropinosomes migrate in a centripetal manner , contracting and rapidly acquiring late endosomal / lysosomal markers such as Rab7 ( Racoosin and Swanson , 1993 ; Kerr et al . , 2006 ) . Although the physiological roles of each Rab protein in macropinosome maturation remain undeﬁned , several Rab proteins are associated with macropinosomes at different points during macropinosome maturation ( Figure 1 ) . Our time - lapse observations revealed that Rab21 and Rab20 are recruited to Rab7 - positive matur - ing macropinosomes in RAW264 macrophages ( Egami and Araki , 2009 , 2012 ) . Rab21 and Rab20 are close homologs of Rab5 ( Schwartz et al . , 2007 ) . These GTPases show similar but not identical spatiotemporal dynamics during macropinocytosis . Although Rab21 is largely colocalized with Rab5 , the recruit - ment of Rab21 to the macropinosomes lags a minute behind that of Rab5 and precedes that of Rab7 ( Egami and Araki , 2009 ) . The difference between Rab5 and Rab21 is further emphasized by the recruitment of Rab21 to the macropinosomes after a decrease in PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels . Rab21 then dissociates from the macropinosomes prior to the accumulation of Lamp1 , a late endosomal / lysosomal protein . Notably , the expression of Rab21 - T33N ( GDP - bound form ) does not inhibit macropinocytic cups or macropinosome formation , suggesting that Rab21 is unnec - essary for macropinosome formation . Similarly to Rab21 , Rab20 is also localized to macropinosomes . Although Rab20 is colocal - ized with Rab5 and Rab21 at the macropinosomal membranes , the association of Rab20 with the macropinosomes persists even after the dissociation of Rab5 and Rab21 ( Egami and Araki , 2012 ) . Intriguingly , Rab20 is colocalized both with Rab7 and Lamp1 on the macropinosomes . At present , the roles of multiple additional Rab GTPases in macropinocytosis remain under investigation . THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF Rac1 DEACTIVATION DURING MACROPINOSOME FORMATION Until recently , most studies have focused on the activation ( switching on ) of Rho family GTPases in membrane rufﬂing and macropinocytosis . However , the pivotal role of the deactivation ( switching off ) of these molecular switches in the completion of macropinocytosis is now becoming clear . Yoshida et al . showed the spatiotemporal activation of Rac1 during macropinosome formation in live macrophages using FRET image analysis , sug - gesting that temporal activation followed by deactivation may be important in the process ( Yoshida et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , using optogenetics to manipulate Rac1 activity through blue laser irradiation , we dissected the roles of Rac1 activation and deactivation in the process of macropinocytosis ( Fujii et al . , 2013 ) . Genetically encoded photoactivatable Rac1 ( PA - Rac1 ) , which is a fusion of the dominant active Rac1 with the light oxygen voltage ( LOV ) domain and J α - chain ( Wu et al . , 2009 ) , can be locally activated in live macrophages by blue laser irradiation under a confocal microscope . When we irradiated a peripheral portion of the cell , remarkable cell surface rufﬂing was induced in the irradiated area . In addition , enhanced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production and actin assembly were conﬁrmed at the region of PA - Rac1 . Soon after irradiation was ceased , rufﬂing receded ; macropinosomes were then formed from the cup or pocket - shaped rufﬂes ( Figures 2A , B ) . Markers of macropinosome mat - uration , such as PI ( 3 ) P and Rab21 , were recruited to the formed macropinosomes after the irradiation was turned off ( Figure 2C ) . However , when we continued the irradiation , macropinosome formation was not observed ; cup or pocket - like structures instead accumulated at the photoactivation region ( Fujii et al . , 2013 ; Araki et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , Rac1 activation alone is insufﬁcient for closing macropinocytic cups into macropinosomes , although it efﬁciently forms circular rufﬂes . These results suggest that deactivation following the activation of Rac1 is crucial to the completion of macropinosome formation . PHOSPHOINOSITIDES AND LIPID - MODIFYING ENZYMES Phosphoinositides are produced by the phosphorylation of phos - phatidylinositol ( PI ) on the 3 , 4 , and 5 positions of its inositol ring . Phosphoinositides comprise only a small fraction of cellular www . frontiersin . org September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 374 | 3 Egami et al . GTPases and phosphoinositides in macropinocytosis FIGURE 1 | Proposed model for the sequential association of small GTPases and phosphoinositides with the processes of macropinocytosis . See text for explanations . membrane phospholipids but are involved in many cellular pro - cesses , such as signal transduction and membrane dynamics ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) . Each phosphoinositide recruits speciﬁc proteins to the membrane domain where the phospho - inositide is enriched , then activates protein function and leads signaling cascades . The processes of macropinocytosis seem to be tightly regulated by a series of phosphoinositides with precise spa - tiotemporal patterns . In this section , we review the involvement of phosphoinositides in membrane rufﬂing , macropinocytic cup formation , macropinosome formation , and macropinosome maturation . Our recent observations of Caenorhabditis elegans , which revealed critical phosphatases that regulate phosphoinosi - tide metabolism in membrane rufﬂes ( Maekawa et al . , 2014 ) , are also described . PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 4 , 5 - BISPHOSPHATE ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) AND PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 4 - PHOSPHATE 5 - KINASES ( PI4P5K ) IN MEMBRANE RUFFLING PI4P5K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) to form phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) . Live - cell imaging using a ﬂuorescent protein – fused PLC - PH domain demonstrated that the levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are markedly increased in membrane rufﬂes and macropinocytic cups ( Araki et al . , 2007 ; Welliver and Swanson , 2012 ) . Therefore , PI4P5K must be locally activated for localized PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 syn - thesis from PI4P . In support of this ﬁnding , both Rac1 and ARF6 , which activate PI4P5K activity ( Honda et al . , 1999 ) , are known to be temporally activated at the same region ( Zhang et al . , 1999 ; Balañá et al . , 2005 ; Yoshida et al . , 2009 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binds to activate various actin - binding proteins and initiates the actin polymerization and reorganization required for membrane rufﬂing , which is a prerequisite for macropinosome formation . Furthermore , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the most common physiological sub - strate for phospholipase C ( PLC ) , which produces two impor - tant messengers : diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) . DAG activates a number of protein kinase C ( PKC ) iso - forms and causes their translocation to the plasma membrane from the cytosol . PKC activation by phorbol ester is known to enhance membrane rufﬂing and macropinocytosis ( Swanson , 1989 ) . The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in the membrane decrease upon macropinosome closure . At that time , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is hydrolyzed to IP 3 and DAG by phospholipase C γ ( PLC γ ) or converted to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 by PI3K during the process of macropinosome forma - tion . However , PLC γ and PI3K seem to function in distinct phases of macropinocytosis . The inhibition of PLC γ by U - 73122 per - turbs macropinocytosis at the rufﬂe formation step , while PI3K Frontiers in Physiology | Membrane Physiology and Membrane Biophysics September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 374 | 4 Egami et al .

After 13min , the irradiation was shifted to a different area of the same cell .

GTPases and phosphoinositides in macropinocytosis inhibitors block macropinocytic cup closure without affecting membrane rufﬂing ( Araki et al . , 2007 ) . The depletion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by PI3K and PLC may be important for the localized release of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding proteins from the membrane ( Terebiznik et al . , 2002 ; Scott et al . , 2005 ) . PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3 , 4 , 5 - TRISPHOSPHATE ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) AND CLASS I PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3 - KINASES ( PI3Ks ) IN MACROPINOSOME FORMATION The necessity of PI3K for membrane rufﬂing varies among differ - ent cell types and receptors . Although PDGF - induced membrane rufﬂing in ﬁbroblasts is eliminated by PI3K inhibitors , mem - brane rufﬂing and circular rufﬂe formation in macrophages and EGF - stimulated A431 cells are resistant to these inhibitors ( Araki et al . , 1996 , 2006 , 2007 ) . The pivotal role of class I PI3K for macropinosome closure has been well established in several cell types ( Araki et al . , 1996 , 2006 ; Amyere et al . , 2000 ) . Using live - cell imaging and scanning electron microscopy of macrophages and EGF - stimulated A431 cells , we showed that PI3K inhibitors such as LY294002 inhibit macropinosome forma - tion but not membrane rufﬂing or actin assembly ( Araki et al . , 1996 , 2006 ) . Ratiometric imaging of ﬂuorescent protein – fused Akt - PH or Btk - PH domains , which are ﬂuorescent probes for PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , relative to the plasma membrane marker has demon - strated that levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are markedly increased after circular rufﬂe formation ( Araki et al . , 2007 ; Yoshida et al . , 2009 ; Welliver and Swanson , 2012 ) . The morphological features of cup - shaped circular rufﬂes restrict the diffusion of membrane proteins and further amplify local signaling inside the cups ( Welliver et al . , 2011 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 binds to the PH domains of several proteins , such as Akt , Btk , PDK1 , and ARNO , and subsequently leads to their downstream signaling pathways . Unlike PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is not required for actin polymerization but instead contributes to actin depolymerization and remodeling through activating ADF / coﬁlin ( Rupper et al . , 2001 ; Nishita et al . , 2004 ; Araki et al . , 2007 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is also known to activate Rac1 through recruiting Vav , a Rac1 GEF ( Patel et al . , 2002 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 isthoughttobeconvertedintoPI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 bySHIP5 - phosphatase . Indeed , imaging of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 with the TAPP domain hasshownthatthetimingofPI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 formationisalmostsimulta - neouswiththedisappearanceofPI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( WelliverandSwanson , 2012 ) . CLASS III PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3 - KINASE ( PI3K ) IN MACROPINOSOME MATURATION A few minutes after macropinosome formation , a considerable amount of PI ( 3 ) P is found on the macropinosome membrane . Because PI ( 3 ) P production is inhibited by 3 - methyladenine , a class III PI3K inhibitor , class III PI3K primarily accounts for the PI ( 3 ) P production on macropinosomes . We have reported that the class III PI3K inhibitor prevents the recruitment of EEA1 , a PI ( 3 ) P - binding membrane tethering protein , to macropinosomes and blocks the homotypic fusion of early macropinosomes ( Hamasaki et al . , 2004 ; Araki et al . , 2006 ) . Live - cell imag - ing of PI ( 3 ) P with the ﬂuorescent protein - fused FYVE domain demonstrates that PI ( 3 ) P is transiently found on the mem - branes of Rab5 - positive early macropinosomes in macrophages ( Yoshida et al . , 2009 ) ; however , in EGF - induced macropinosomes in A431 cells , PI ( 3 ) P remains on the membranes as long as macropinosomes are present ( Araki et al . , 2006 ) . Unlike macrophage macropinosomes , macropinosomes in A431 cells never mature to fuse with lysosomes . The conversion of PI ( 3 ) P to PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 by PIKfyve activity may be required for further macropinosome maturation to fuse with late endosomes or lyso - somes in the degradation pathway ( Kerr et al . , 2010 ) . Sorting nexin 5 ( SNX5 ) , which possesses a PX domain that binds PI ( 3 ) P , is localized on EEA1 - positive macropinosomes and tubular exten - sions from these macropinosomes ( Kerr et al . , 2006 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ; Kerr and Teasdale , 2009 ) . The dissociation of SNX5 - positive tubules from the macropinosome is thought to promote its maturation . DEGRADATION OF PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 IN MEMBRANE RUFFLES In addition to the burst of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 production inside of circular rufﬂes ( macropinocytic cups ) , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is produced and degraded to a lesser extent in the dorsal membrane rufﬂes . Using ﬂuid - phase uptake mutants of C . elegans , we have identi - ﬁed myotubularin - related proteins ( MTMRs ) as phosphoinosi - tide 3 - phosphatases that function at membrane rufﬂes ( Maekawa et al . , 2014 ) . In the next two subsections , we describe the use - fulness of C . elegans mutants in identifying important genes for macropinocytosis , as well as the sequential breakdown of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 → PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 → PI ( 3 ) P → PI in the rufﬂing membrane through the action of SHIP 5 - phosphatase , inositol polyphos - phate 4 - phosphatase ( INPP4 ) , and myotubularin - related proteins ( MTMRs ) . Fluid - phase uptake mutants in C . elegans C . elegans contains six scavenger - like cells , called coelomocytes , in its pseudocoelom ( body cavity ) ( Figure 3A ) . Coelomocytes actively and continuously endocytose ﬂuids and solutes to clear them from the body cavity . Considering these coelomo - cyte characteristics , Fares and Greenwald developed an elegant assay to monitor the endocytic activity of coelomocytes in situ ( Figure 3B ) ( Fares and Greenwald , 2001 ) . This assay employs a transgenic worm ( arIs37 ) containing myo - 3p : : ssGFP . The trans - gene induces the synthesis of a secretory signal sequence – GFP chimera in the body wall muscles . GFP is secreted into the body cavity from the body wall muscles and then endocytosed by coelomocytes . GFP is thus only detected in the coelomocytes of the transgenic worms ( Figures 3B , C ) . Through examining known viable endocytosis mutants and RNAi results for other known endocytosis genes , possible causal genes for c oelomocyte up take defective ( CUP ) phenotypes were determined . In these CUP mutants , GFP accumulates in the body cavity because of the defective uptake of GFP by coelomocytes ( Figures 3B , C ) . The CUP genes identiﬁed to date are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Phosphatases that degrade 3 - phosphorylated phosphoinositides in membrane rufﬂes Macropinocytosis in mammalian cells may resemble the pro - cess of ﬂuid uptake in coelomocytes . We therefore examined if mammalian orthologs of the CUP genes are involved in macropinocytosis .

Note that the other tissues of C . elegans are not shown for the sake of explanation . ( B ) Diagrams of the ﬂuid - phase endocytosis assay . In wild - type worms containing myo - 3p : : ssGFP , GFP synthesized in the body wall muscle cells is secreted into the body cavity and taken up by coelomocytes . In wild - type worms , GFP signals are detected only in the coelomocytes . In CUP mutants containing myo - 3p : : ssGFP , GFP is not endocytosed by coelomocytes and is therefore accumulated in the body cavity . Note that the coelomocytes are magniﬁed for the sake of explanation . ( C ) Images of wild - type worms and mtm - 6 ( ok330 ) III mutants ( one of the CUP mutants ; see Supplementary Table 1 ) . All worms contain myo - 3p : : ssGFP . Coelomocytes in the mtm - 6 mutants do not have GFP - positive vesicles , and GFP accumulates in the body cavity ( indicated by a white arrow ) . Coelomocytes are indicated by broken yellow lines . Scale bars : 10 μ m ( adapted from Maekawa et al . , 2014 ) . 6 ( MTMR6 ) and myotubularin - related protein 9 ( MTMR9 ) , mammalian ortholog of mtm - 6 and mtm - 9 , are essential for macropinocytosis in A431 cells ( Maekawa et al . , 2014 ) . MTMR6 and MTMR9 belong to the myotubularin family phospho - inositide 3 - phosphatases ( Robinson and Dixon , 2006 ; Hnia et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting that the degradation of PI ( 3 ) P to PI is required for macropinosome formation . Cells depleted of MTMR6 or MTMR9 still show membrane rufﬂing after EGF stimulation , suggesting that MTMR6 and MTMR9 function in the steps that follow the formation of membrane rufﬂes ( Maekawa et al . , 2014 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 are transiently generated in dorsal membrane rufﬂes during circular rufﬂe formation in PDGF - stimulated NIH3T3 cells ( Hasegawa et al . , 2011 ) . As MTMR6 is a 3 - phosphatase ( Schaletzky et al . , 2003 ) , we reasoned that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is dephosphorylated by 4 - phosphatase to provide the substrate PI ( 3 ) P to MTMR6 . INPP4B is a speciﬁc 4 - phosphatase of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( Norris et al . , 1997 ; Ivetac et al . , 2005 ; Gewinner et al . , 2009 ) . Using RNAi knockdown experiments , we found that INPP4B is essential for macropinocytosis in EGF - stimulated A431 cells ( Maekawa et al . , 2014 ) . Similarly to the knockdowns of MTMR6 and MTMR9 , the knockdown of INPP4B did not inhibit www . frontiersin . org September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 374 | 7 Egami et al . GTPases and phosphoinositides in macropinocytosis EGF - induced membrane rufﬂing . Therefore , INPP4B likely also functions at the steps after the formation of membrane rufﬂes . In light of a report that SHIP2 , a 5 - phosphatase of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , is involved in PDGF - induced circular rufﬂe formation in NIH3T3 cells after PDGF ( Hasegawa et al . , 2011 ) , these results suggest that PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is sequentially converted to PI in membrane rufﬂes by speciﬁc PI phosphatases and that this process is indispensable for circular rufﬂe / macropinocytic cup formation . Live cell imag - ing of EGF - stimulated A431 cells expressing ﬂuorescent Akt - PH or TAPP1 - PH domains has consistently detected signiﬁcant levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) 3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 at the membrane of EGF - stimulated rufﬂing ( Maekawa et al . , 2014 ) , although these increased levels are not as high as those detected on the membrane inside of macropinocytic cups after circular rufﬂe formation ( Welliver and Swanson , 2012 ) . When monitoring PI ( 3 ) P using a GFP - fused FYVE domain , PI ( 3 ) P is faintly observed in the rufﬂing membrane . However , in MTMR6 - depeleted A431 cells with RNAi , signiﬁcant levels of PI ( 3 ) P are detected in the membrane of EGF - induced dorsal ruf - ﬂing . Double knockdown of MTMR6 and SHIP2 or of MTMR6 and INPP4B prevents the emergence of PI ( 3 ) P after EGF stim - ulation , indicating that the PI ( 3 ) P in the membrane rufﬂes is produced through the sequential breakdown of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by SHIP2 and INPP4B . The level of PI ( 3 ) P in the membrane rufﬂe is much lower than that in the membranes of early macropinosomes , which is produced through the phospho - rylation of PI by class III PI3K . However , the transient PI ( 3 ) P production in the membrane rufﬂe may be required for the activation of KCa3 . 1 , a Ca 2 + - activated K + channel ( Srivastava et al . , 2005 ) . Actually , KCa3 . 1 localizes to membrane rufﬂes and is essential for macropinosome formation ( Maekawa et al . , 2014 ) . MACROPINOCYTOSIS IN DICTYOSTELIUM DISCOIDEUM Dictyostelium discoideum is a genetically and biochemically tractable soil ameba . In D . discoideum , active macropinocytosis constitutively occurs for the uptake of nutrients from the envi - ronment and can be experimentally detected through the obser - vation of macropinosomes labeled by ﬂuorophore - conjugated dextran , a ﬂuid - phase marker , added to the medium . Therefore , the molecular mechanisms of macropinocytosis in D . discoideum have been elucidated , as have those of phagocytosis and chemo - taxis , using gene disruption and protein expression ( Maniak , 2001 ) . Similarly to that in mammalian cells , macropinocyto - sis in D . discoideum is actin - dependent ( Hacker et al . , 1997 ) . Null mutants of coronin , an actin - binding protein , and Daip1 , an actin - interacting protein , present defective macropinocytosis ( Maniak et al . , 1995 ; Konzok et al . , 1999 ) . Rac1 GTPase also regu - lates macropinocytosis in D . discoideum ( Dumontier et al . , 2000 ) . Another study using null mutants and an inhibitor has indi - cated that class I PI3K and its downstream effector , protein kinase B ( PKB / Akt ) , regulate macropinocytosis in this species ( Rupper et al . , 2001 ) . More recently , Hoeller et al . ( 2013 ) revealed two distinct functions for class I PI3K isoforms in macropinocytosis using systematic genetic ablation . PI3K1 and 2 produce patches of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 associated with actin - dependent rufﬂe formation , and PI3K4 is required for the conversion of rufﬂes into intracel - lular macropinosomes . Furthermore , these authors identiﬁed two speciﬁc Ras proteins , RasG and RasS , that interact with PI3K1 / 2 and PI3K4 ( Hoeller et al . , 2013 ) . Through expressing probes for phosphoinositides , the dynam - ics of 3 - phosphoinositides can be visualized during macropinocy - tosis in D . discoideum ( Dormann et al . , 2004 ; Hoeller et al . , 2013 ; Veltman et al . , 2014 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 transiently increases at the macropinocytic cups , followed by rapid PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 generation at the periphery of the macropinosomes upon internalization , suggesting that PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is degraded to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 through macropinosome maturation ( Dormann et al . , 2004 ) . Similar phosphoinositide kinetics are observed during macropinocytosis in mammalian macrophages ( Welliver and Swanson , 2012 ) . Thus , this free - living ameba shares many features of macropinocyto - sis with mammalian phagocytes such as macrophages ( Cardelli , 2001 ) . Although careful attention should be given to the dif - ferences in the molecular mechanisms of macropinocytosis between D . discoideum and mammalian cells , information from this species is generally helpful for the analysis of mammalian macropinocytosis . CONCLUDING REMARKS Our current knowledge of the macropinocytic pathway in mam - mals has been primarily derived from pharmacological and gene overexpression approaches . However , due to the off - target effects or incomplete inhibition , it is occasionally difﬁcult to identify a single key gene for a certain process of macropinocytosis . In this respect , genetic studies of C . elegans and D . discoideum are useful for identifying crucial regulators of macropinocytosis , although careful attention must be given to the differences in the molec - ular mechanisms among different organisms . Additionally , the application of newly developed genome editing systems such as CRISPR / Cas9 may shed light on this endocytic mechanism in mammalian cells . To better understand the dynamic mechanisms coordinating macropinosome formation and maturation in both space and time , both the genetic identiﬁcation of key molecules and live cell imaging are crucial . Combining morphological stud - ies with FRET imaging , super - resolution microscopy , and / or optogenetics will be quite valuable for dissecting the dynamic molecular mechanisms of this process . Although still incompletely understood , the molecular mech - anism that controls macropinocytosis has been greatly eluci - dated in recent years . It is now apparent that large numbers of signaling and mechanistic molecules spatiotemporally regu - late the coordinated processes of macropinosome formation and maturation . The complex interplay of small GTPase molecular switches and phosphoinositides orchestrates the highly sophis - ticated processes of macropinocytosis ( Figure 1 ) . However , the regulation of macropinocytosis may partly be dependent on cell type . Macropinocytosis is constitutive in antigen - presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells ( Steinman and Swanson , 1995 ; Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) , but it can also be rapidly induced by growth factors in other cell types , such as epithelial cells and ﬁbroblasts . Macropinosomes usually mature and merge with the lysosomal degradative pathway . However , macropinosomes in certain cell types , such as A431 cells , do not deliver their ﬂuid contents to the degradation pathway and are instead extracellularly regurgitated by recycling pathways Frontiers in Physiology | Membrane Physiology and Membrane Biophysics September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 374 | 8 Egami et al . GTPases and phosphoinositides in macropinocytosis ( Hewlett , 1994 ; Hamasaki et al . , 2004 ) . Although the biological signiﬁcance of this backﬂow is unknown , it is of special inter - est for elucidating the differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the distinct emergence and fate of macropinosomes in different cell types . If we can determine these differences using molecular and signaling comparisons of the two distinct macropinocytic pathways , we can manipulate macropinocyto - sis through activating or inhibiting the key signals . Several pathogenic microorganisms that enter thorough macropinocyto - sis interfere with macropinosome maturation to survive inside of the cell . The manipulation of macropinocytosis would therefore also be to our advantage in developing therapeutic strategies for human diseases involve macropinocytic activity .
