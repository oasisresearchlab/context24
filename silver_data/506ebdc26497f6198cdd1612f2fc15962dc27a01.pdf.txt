May 2016 ■ Journal of Dental Education 569 Continuing Education A Systematic Literature Review of the Information - Seeking Behavior of Dentists in Developed Countries Amy Isham , MaapSciLibInfoMgt ; Silvana Bettiol , PhD ; Ha Hoang , PhD ; Leonard Crocombe , PhD Abstract : Understanding the information - seeking behavior of dentists may inform ways to increase the dentist uptake of evidence - based research for clinical decision making and the practice of evidence - based dentistry , but no systematic review of dentist information - seeking behavior has been conducted . This review aimed to synthesize the best available evidence on where and how dentists seek information . A literature search of Web of Science , Scopus , PubMed , and reference lists of English language studies from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries of dentists’ information - seeking behavior published between 2002 and 2014 was conducted . Selected articles were assessed using mixed methods analysis , and the data extracted were thematically synthesized . Nine studies met the inclusion criteria , and four main themes were identified : dentists’ difficulty translating evidence - based resources into clinical practice ; dentists’ preference for face - to - face meetings , collegial discussion , and print materials over evidence - based resources ; dentists’ perceptions of the validity of evidence - based resources and the role of specialist and experienced dentists as information sources for general and less experienced dentists ; and differences between early and late adopters of research evidence . Dentists in these studies tended to adopt new materials / techniques after discussion with a colleague , a dental specialist , or a respected dental expert . These dentists also reported lacking time , experience , skills , and confidence to find and use evidence - based resources . Many of the dentists studied were cautious about making decisions based on documentary sources like literature reviews and preferred to seek advice from an experienced or specialist colleague or to participate in face - to - face meetings .

Keywords : dentists , clinical decision making , evidence - based dentistry , information - seeking behavior Submitted for publication 4 / 29 / 15 ; accepted 11 / 15 / 15 “I nformation - seeking” is defined as a process of inquiry in which people purposefully engage to change their state of knowledge . 1 Many models have attempted to map the process of information - seeking since 1993 when Ellis estab - lished one of the first models of information - seeking , expanded in research by Kulthau and Wilson into a more comprehensive model . 2 - 4 These models have varied in their ability to explore the various variables of information source selection , levels of informa - tion need , and cycles of feedback and review and determine whether the information need has been satisfied by a search . 5 The activity of information - seeking consists of question formulation , refining a search , and the resources or sources used , which can be people or documentary . One study also explored the barriers to information - seeking by specific groups to develop ways to overcome these barriers . 6 The Australian Dental Association defines evidence - based dentistry ( EBD ) as “an approach to health care that requires the judicious integra - tion of systematic assessments of the best clinically relevant scientific evidence” and contends that the implementation of critically assessed data is ide - ally performed in partnership between dentist and patient . 7 Both EBD and information - seeking relate to an individual’s interaction with information for a specific purpose , and both incorporate feedback loops to assess the information’s suitability for the information need . However , information - seeking en - compasses a broader range of behavior and includes more sources than EBD , which generally refers to 570 Journal of Dental Education ■ Volume 80 , Number 5 as one of a larger group of practitioners . The review also sought to assess the information - seeking behav - ior of dentists for the purpose of making clinical deci - sions , not for other purposes . However , no articles were excluded on that basis that were not already excluded for other reasons . The inclusion and exclu - sion criteria are shown in Table 1 , and categories of articles included and excluded are shown in Figure 1 . The PubMed , Scopus , and Web of Science databases were searched using Boolean operators and the following keywords : information - seeking , dentists , clinical decisions , and evidence - based . In - clusion and exclusion criteria were applied at title and abstract search levels , followed by full text analysis of those articles that met the inclusion criteria . The detailed process of applying the inclusion and ex - clusion criteria is shown in Figure 1 . Snowballing techniques were then applied whereby the reference lists of retrieved articles were searched for other relevant citations . One reviewer conducted the search of full text articles against the inclusion and exclu - sion criteria , and the other reviewers assisted in the assessment of methodological quality , data extrac - tion , and data synthesis . The quality of the articles selected for review was assessed by two authors for methodological validity using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool developed at McGill University in Canada . 13 Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion or with a third reviewer . Selected studies were classified by type of re - search ( qualitative or quantitative study ) and then as - sessed according to six criteria designed to assist with evaluating the methodological quality . An overall quality score for each study was calculating by divid - ing the number of criteria met by the total number of criteria as per the appropriate methodological quality criteria for quantitative and qualitative studies . 14 the synthesis of scholarly peer - reviewed information rather than consultation with people sources . 8 - 11 As evidence - based medicine and dentistry are seen as a method of increasing the uptake of up - to - date best evidence in clinical practice , information - seeking as a distinct part of this process can offer insights into the capabilities , perceptions , and needs of dentists . There has not been a comprehensive review of the literature on the information - seeking behavior of dentists ; the articles that are available are from fields such as library and information science , dentistry , and the evidence - based movement . Although similarities exist between the information - seeking literature and EBD in regard to searching for and assessing the information , EBD includes patient feedback in that process . 4 Overall , little is known about information - seeking behaviors of dentists . A better understanding of the information - seeking behaviors of dentists will assist education providers , such as dental schools , in designing tertiary education programs and dental associations in developing continuing education ( CE ) and pro - fessional development programs . It will also help policymakers , decision support system designers , and creators of new knowledge understand the best methods of supplying accessible information that will encourage EBD . The aim of this review was to synthesize the best available recent evidence on where and how dentists seek information . Methods The review considered both qualitative and quantitative studies , written in English , and published between 2004 and 2014 . 12 This review focused on studies in which dentists were the only group of par - ticipants and excluded studies that included dentists Table 1 .

An overview of characteristics of the studies included in the review is shown in Table 4 . Of the nine studies , six were conducted in the U . S . , one was a collaboration between researchers in Denmark and the U . S . , one was conducted in the U . K . , and one was conducted in Turkey . Six were quantitative studies using self - administered survey questionnaires . Three studies were qualitative using focus groups , vignettes , or semi - structured inter - views . Four major themes were identified ( Table 5 ) . Translating Evidence - Based Resources into Clinical Practice Both qualitative and quantitative studies re - viewed indicated that these dentists had difficulty applying information from peer - reviewed journals , literature searches , and other evidence - based re - sources such as practice guidelines in their clinical Data extracted from the reviewed articles were the study populations , study methods , and main out - comes . The text about where and how dentists seek information was coded and concepts identified . Two authors performed the thematic analysis . For each article , all the participant quotations ( qualitative stud - ies ) and text in the results and / or discussion / conclu - sion sections ( quantitative studies ) were extracted . The two authors independently coded the extracted data , categorized the codes , and generated themes . The results were compared and discussed at regular meetings involving all authors until consensus was reached . Results From an initial pool of 278 published articles , nine met the inclusion criteria ( Table 1 ) . The result of the review process is shown in Figure 1 . The articles Figure 1 .

Number of studies in each theme Theme Number of Studies Difficulty translating evidence 5 Preference for print and face - to - face 6 Validity concerns of research 5 Information diffusion between generalist 6 and specialist / experienced dentists Validity of Evidence - Based Resources and Use of Specialists The studies reviewed suggested that the dentists were skeptical about the authority , validity , and rel - evance of many evidence - based resources . 1 , 9 , 14 , 15 , 18 , 19 Dentists place a high value on source validity and authority , and these studies suggested dentist mistrust of the scientific and peer - reviewed literature . 1 , 9 , 15 , 18 , 19 Although scientific caution is possibly an aspect of dentists’ clinical process , Spallek et al . found this mistrust in scientific information to be a new finding not previously mentioned . 18 In a quantitative study , Funkhouser et al . tried to distinguish between the frequency of use of an information source and its influence on the dentist’s practice and were surprised that newer graduates , whom they assumed would be more active online than their counterparts who graduated earlier , rated face - to - face CE and association meetings as more influential than online courses . 16 Hopper et al . found that this mistrust of evidence - based guidelines came from the need for an outside assessment of the data , so that the dentists could be advised since , as one said , “I wouldn’t have time to look at whether the right stats were being used . ” 19 Botello - Harbaum et al . acknowledged that this suspicion about whether a source was reliable or authoritative explained why the dentists preferred to attend face - to - face CE meetings since “speakers are often recognized as authorities in their field , prompting a greater level of trust in their information . ” 1 Early Versus Late Adopters Five studies noted a distinction between early adopters of newer research evidence published in peer - reviewed databases and journals and late adopt - ers who tended to consult experts and preferred to read trade and local journals regularly for their clini - cal practice decisions . 1 , 14 , 15 , 18 , 19 Late adopters waited for a “large body of evidence” to compel them to change their clinical practice methods , especially if they perceived their current methods as effective . 19 Subjects commented that research did not always yield the clinical results they promised , possibly due to time constraints in general practice . 19 The combination of reliable and easily used data was dif - ficult to find , even by the expert dentists , since often detailed and valid statistics were available yet were considered too complex . This could explain the need Authors speculated that low use of some online sources related to a lack of critical ability to analyze and use evidence - based information in their practices . 9 , 15 , 16 , 18 Some experienced dentists themselves found a lot of clinical guidelines relevant but lengthy to read and therefore difficult to use in their practice due to lack of time . 18 The dentists also reported feeling that a lot of research was not relevant to their practice . 19 Those dentists who were aware of the availability of research made comments such as “ [ I ] need to develop a critical eye , ” referring to their ability to synthesize and utilize the information they retrieved so that they could apply it in their practice . 14 Preference for Meetings , Discussion , and Print Materials Due to the difficulty of translating new research into practice , these dentists were found to have a higher preference for print textbooks , subscription journals , face - to - face discussion , meetings , and lo - cal CE than for databases and other online sources of the literature . 1 , 9 , 11 , 15 , 16 Colleagues were often con - sidered a better resource than the scientific literature as the practical application of knowledge could be explained in a way that was personalized . 14 , 19 Studies also found greater use of face - to - face association meetings , specific single subscription journals , and discussion with colleagues than the use of Medline or PubMed . 1 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 19 Straub - Morarend et al . observed that reliance on other professionals , although limited , was “arguably economical and readily accessible” for dentists who have time con - straints . 9 A lack of computer literacy among dentists from both metropolitan and rural areas was noted , and some authors recommended increased literacy to resolve their isolation issues . 1 , 11 In contrast to the use of people and older print resources , one study reported a low uptake of clinical decision making software by dentists . 15 May 2016 ■ Journal of Dental Education 575 priate information or lacked the ability to synthesize it for clinical application . 1 , 9 , 14 , 15 , 18 , 19 These issues of knowledge translation , skepticism about source va - lidity , and alternate source - seeking could be resolved through more strategic dissemination strategies to reach dentists in clinical practice . Lack of appropriate dissemination systems and networks could also contribute to these dentists’ preference for face - to - face communication despite the availability of large quantities of quality infor - mation . The evidence of dentists’ frequent use of collegial communication could suggest that formal - ized networks be developed to take advantage of this information - seeking behavior . Formalized networks such as these could increase uptake of evidence - based information and allow specialists to serve as experts on specific procedures to the benefit of less experienced dentists in the profession . Leckie et al . ’s model of information - seeking proposed that all professionals look for relevance , reliability , and accessibility in an information source , but that accessibility was the most significant factor . 6 Given that many dentists work alone or have high patient quotas , the importance of accessibility for information source selection may influence their preferences for print journals and textbooks , visual resources , and face - to - face consultation with a col - league . When translating information sources into practice , some dentists complained that the informa - tion they required was not yet available , took too long to read , or that they preferred a verbal interchange with a well - known expert . 1 , 9 , 14 , 15 , 18 , 19 These issues relate to Leckie et al . ’s concept of relevance . 6 A per - ception of prior success with an information source created a sense of reliability and accessibility related to how usable the information was . The question of reliability and accessibility begs the question as to whether there are issues with the dentist’s skill or training or shortcomings with the data available . The situation of experienced or specialist dentists who provide a dissemination service to less experienced and general dentists requires further examination . Hertzum , an information scientist , stud - ied the act of “expert - seeking” among professionals from many fields , exploring the context in which professionals seek people as information sources over documentary sources such as databases . 21 He posited a theory of high and low information needs in which high information needs were related to “process , opinion , and decision making” and people sources were more appropriate for those higher needs . This for further consultation with a dentist perceived as experienced and authoritative for decision making . 18 Hopper et al . described the group of later adopt - ers as “not reflective , ” meaning that although they read journals , they were reluctant to apply what they read to their practice . 19 Some general dentists in that study noted that they would ask for help from dentists who were interested in research or were early adopt - ers , who would then feed the information to the other dentists . One specialist dentist in a different study mentioned that he was “someone that people would go to for information” and that he often contacted other specialists for information . 14 Specialists , due to their greater experience and training , often showed a preference for seeking their clinical practice informa - tion in scientific peer - reviewed sources over general dentists who preferred to seek it from specialists . Hopper et al . noted that the difference between early adopters and later adopters was that the early adopters operated as information diffusers of the latest , most valid , and most reliable information , often in the face of criticism and resistance from other more cautious dentists or practice managers . 19 Discussion This systematic literature review found that the way in which dentists are urged to search for information differs from the way they actually search . The NHMRC hierarchy of evidence pyramid recommends that dentists consult first systematic re - views and randomized controlled trials , followed by pseudo - randomized controlled trials , cohort studies , and case controlled studies , and lastly comparative studies and case studies . Expert opinion does not feature in the pyramid , but if it were at the bottom and the pyramid were turned upside down , it would match more accurately the way in which these den - tists actually searched for information . 20 Our findings about the dentists’ difficulty in uti - lizing and applying best quality up - to - date evidence need to be further investigated to better understand their causes . If these causes could be identified , they would contribute to education designs that could improve the uptake of EBD . This would particularly benefit solo , isolated , and rural dentists who have less frequent access to training and collegial support for their information - seeking . The studies reviewed suggested that the participating dentists either lacked the computer or critical literacy to discern the appro - 576 Journal of Dental Education ■ Volume 80 , Number 5 There are three essential areas for further re - search : explore the computer , critical , and informa - tion literacy of dentists ; explore the design , relevance , and accessibility of evidence - based documentary sources such as systematic reviews or procedural guidelines ; and explore the efficacy of the dissemina - tion of new research through formal tertiary and CE in comparison with informal information - seeking be - tween dental colleagues . A study could be conducted on these aspects of information - seeking , surveying a broad range of dentists across rural and metropolitan areas , public and private practice , and primary and specialist care . Limitations of this study were that the grey lit - erature was not included and that no distinction could be drawn in several of the studies between clinical information - seeking and non - clinical information - seeking , as some of the quantitative studies did not incorporate it into the survey design . Grey literature refers to unpublished research or research that has been published in non - commercial form , such as government reports , conference proceedings , news and bulletins , and research reports . Some useful information on our topic may have been available in these sources . Conclusion Many of the dentists studied in the reviewed articles were cautious about making clinical decisions based on documentary sources like literature reviews and preferred to seek an experienced colleague or at - tend face - to - face meetings . The reasons for this could relate to the quality of evidence - based information available for dentists ; time constraints in a busy den - tal practice ; abilities or lack thereof regarding critical thinking , information - seeking , and synthesization among dentists in different contexts ; or current dis - semination strategies used to distribute current best evidence recommended for dental practice .

Karen Campbell , Campus theory is consistent with Kulthau’s theory of high and low information needs . 3 It is possible that dentists seek information from people sources when their information needs are higher than on other occasions when they access documentary sources . Hertzum’s review could inform a future study in which the reasons for dentists’ seeking information from more experienced people sources are explored . The correlation between the number of years since dentists’ graduation and their use of non - evidence - based print , face - to - face training , and dis - cussion with colleagues was a surprising result . 14 , 18 One would expect newer graduates , being more computer - savvy , to be greater users of evidence - based information such as peer - reviewed materials in electronic databases than dentists who graduated earlier . This correlation between earlier dental school graduation date and information and critical literacies requires further research to ascertain why apparently older dentists seek information more easily than more recent graduates . Also important are the critical literacies to interpret and assess relevance for an information need . Levine et al . documented an interdisciplinary course about information resource use in conjunction with EBD and performed a review of the literature that revealed a lot of dental schools failed to teach the ability to conduct critical appraisals of the best available evidence . 10 However , Hopper et al . ’s study stressed the importance of clinical experience and “pattern recognition” for effective clinical outcomes , which is a separate skill to finding and analyzing the best evidence for clinical use . 19 There is a need for further research aimed at understanding the preferred source selection and information - seeking habits of dentists in order to assist dental practitioners and education providers such as dental schools and dental associations in providing CE training and continuing professional development in a fashion that is most suitable for dental practitioners . To further explore the concept of information diffusion channels , McGlone et al . noted that the method of information diffusion in dental education was critical , particularly if the desired outcome of the education was to result in changed clinical practice . 22 The education of dentists in the use of new materials was more effective when the form of education den - tists received was hands - on although further research is required to ascertain what kinds of education lead to changes in clinical practice .
