China 7 8 Abstract 9 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) Omicron variant 10 has become the dominant lineage worldwide . Experimental studies have shown that 11 SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant is more stable on various environmental surfaces than 12 the ancestral strains of SARS - CoV - 2 . However , the influences on the role of the contact 13 route in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission are still unknown . In this study , we built a Markov 14 chain model to simulate the transmission of the Omicron and ancestral strains of SARS - 15 CoV - 2 within a household over a 1 - day period from multiple pathways ; that is , airborne , 16 droplet , and contact routes . We assumed that there were two adults and one child in the 17 household , and that one of the adults was infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . We assumed two 18 scenarios . ( 1 ) Asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , and ( 2 ) symptomatic infection . 19 During asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , the contact route contributing the 20 most ( 37 % – 45 % ) , followed by the airborne ( 34 % – 38 % ) and droplet routes ( 21 % – 28 % ) . 21 During symptomatic infection , the droplet route was the dominant pathway ( 48 % – 71 % ) , 22 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 followed by the contact route ( 25 % – 42 % ) , with the airborne route playing a negligible 23 role ( < 10 % ) . Compared to the ancestral strain , although the contribution of the contact 24 route increased in Omicron variant transmission , the increase was slight , from 25 % – 25 41 % to 30 % – 45 % . With the growing concern about the increase in the proportion of 26 asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection in Omicron strain transmissions , the airborne 27 route , rather than the fomite route , should be of focus . Our findings suggest the 28 importance of ventilation in the SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant prevention in building 29 environment . 30 31 Keywords : Omicron variant ; ancestral strains ; airborne ; contact ; Markov chain model 32 33 # Those authors contributed equally 34 * Corresponding to : Dr .

SARS - CoV - 48 2 is a respiratory infection believed to be transmitted mainly through direct contact , 49 droplets , fomites , and airborne routes ( WHO , 2020 ) . Exploring the relative importance 50 of different transmission routes is crucial for developing targeted infection - control 51 strategies . However , the extent to which different transmission routes contribute to 52 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission between humans remains unclear . 53 54 Modelling studies have evaluated the relative importance of evaluating transmission 55 through different routes for SARS - CoV - 2 wild strains in healthcare settings ( Jones , 56 2020 ; Mizukoshi et al . , 2021 ) or households ( Lei et al . , 2021a ) . One study in healthcare 57 setting suggested that droplet and airborne transmission routes may predominate over 58 the contact route ( Jones , 2020 ) . While Mizukoshi and his colleagues suggested fomite 59 route was the major contributor at high virus concentration in the saliva in healthcare 60 setting ( Mizukoshi et al . , 2021 ) . Fomites as a mode of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission are 61 thought to play an important role at the beginning of the pandemic , with laboratory 62 studies revealing that SARS - CoV - 2 can persist on plastic , stainless steel , and other 63 surfaces for hours to days ( Chin et al . , 2020 ; Pastorino et al . , 2020 ; Marcel et al . , 2020 ) . 64 By May 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and other agencies were 65 recommending careful and thorough washing of hands and disinfection of frequently 66 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 touched surfaces . The importance of fomite in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission was first 67 confirmed in July 2020 ( Aboubakr et al . , 2021 ; Katona et al . , 2022 ) , with the literature 68 in different settings strengthening this argument . The Centers for Disease Control and 69 Prevention ( CDC ) had stated that “people can be infected with SARS - CoV - 2 through 70 contact with surfaces . However , based on available epidemiological data and studies of 71 environmental transmission factors , surface transmission is not the main route by which 72 SARS - CoV - 2 spreads , and the risk is considered low . ” ( CDC , 2020 ) . 73 74 The newly emerged Omicron SARS - CoV - 2 variant was first identified on November 75 19 , 2021 , in South Africa ( Viana et al . , 2022 ) , and soon became the dominant strain 76 worldwide , suggesting its high transmissibility in humans . A recent structural study 77 indicated that its spike protein is more stable than that of the ancestral strain ( Zeng et 78 al . , 2021 ) , and an experimental study showed that the SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant 79 was more stable on various environmental surfaces compared with ancestral strain 80 ( Chin et al . , 2022 ) . In addition , Omicron variant has a much higher rate of asymptomatic 81 infection than ancestral strain ( Garret et al . , 2021 ) . And infection with Omicron was 82 less severe than with ancestral strain ( Menni et al . , 2021 ) . Omicron variant has 83 difficulty to mitigate its transmission for its high transmissibility under the strict public 84 health and social measures in other countries ( Kim et al . , 2022 ) . Thus , the transmission 85 routes of Omicron variant may be different to these of ancestral strain . The transmission 86 of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron via packaging has been reported over the past few months . 87 However , how the changes in surface stability would influence the role of fomite route 88 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 in SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant transmission remains unknown . 89 90 The relative importance of different transmission routes varies in different scenarios 91 ( Gao et al . , 2021 ) . In this study , we considered a household environment because 92 households are high - risk settings for the transmission of COVID - 19 ( Lei et al . , 2020a ) 93 and are an important factor in wider community spread ( Haroon et al . , 2020 ; Harris et 94 al . , 2021 ) . It has been reported that most clustered COVID - 19 infections in the first 95 wave in China were within families ( WHO , 2020 ; Special Expert Group for Control of 96 the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine 97 Association , 2020 ) , suggesting high rates of intra - family transmission and urging 98 prioritization of studies on risk factors for household transmission . 99 100 Methods 101 Environmental setting 102 The mean household size is 2 . 95 members in China ( National Bureau of Statistics of 103 China , 2019 ) , as compared to 2 . 52 in the USA ( Statista Research Department , 2022 ) . 104 Thus , the household size was assumed to be three , that is , two parents and one child 105 around 10 years of age , since the contacts between little baby and parents are unique 106 and different to these between parents and children with age > 6 . So here we considered 107 one child around 10 years of age to represent a more general child - to - parent contact 108 patterns . Since adults are more susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 and there is no gender 109 difference in susceptibility to COVID - 19 ( WHO , 2020 ) , one of the parents was 110 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 assumed to be infected with SARS - CoV - 2 and the other two individuals were assumed 111 to be susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 . In this study , we modeled the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 112 infection in two susceptible individuals during a 1 - day exposure to the household 113 environment . 114 115 Transmission route definition 116 As a respiratory infection , SARS - CoV - 2 can be transmitted by contact , droplets , 117 fomites , airborne routes , and possible fecal - oral , bloodborne , and intrauterine routes 118 ( WHO , 2020 ) . In this study , we considered four major transmission routes : contact , 119 droplet , fomite , and airborne routes , and classified them into the following three 120 categories : 121 1 . The airborne route refers to the direct inhalation of an infectious agent through small 122 droplet nuclei , where the residue of large droplets containing microorganisms that 123 have evaporated to an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 µm ( termed respirable ) 124 ( Nicas and Jones , 2009 ) . These respirable droplets can then be deposited in the 125 respiratory tract . 126 2 . The droplet route refers to the inhalation of the virus carried in respirable airborne 127 particles with a diameter between 10 and 100 microns ( termed inspirable ) ( Nicas 128 and Jones , 2009 ) , and the droplet spray of large droplets ( > 100 microns in diameter ) 129 onto facial target membranes . 130 3 . The contact route includes both direct and indirect contact routes . Direct contact 131 route refers to infection transmission through person - to - person contact such as 132 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 shaking hands . The indirect contact route is also called the fomite route , which 133 refers to infection transmission by touching objects or surfaces that have previously 134 been contaminated by hands or by the direct deposition of infectious pathogens 135 from infected individuals . Direct and indirect contact routes are difficult to 136 distinguish because hands can be contaminated via both routes , and the virus 137 concentration on the hands of susceptible individuals sequentially influences the 138 exposure level . Thus , in this study , the two routes have merged to one route . And 139 we evaluated the relative importance of direct and indirect contact routes via the 140 relative infection risk when the susceptible individuals did not touch fomites or 141 hands of the infector . 142 143 The exposure pathway model 144 A Markov chain was used to model the movement of the virus between select 145 compartments in the household environment ( Figure 1 ) , which described virus moved 146 between the states according to rate constants in the direction of the arrows . Based on 147 this model , the viral load after n time steps can be calculated . In addition , we also 148 described this model in detail in the Method . We used this model to study multi - route 149 infection transmission in airplanes , households , and hospitals ( Lei et al . , 2018 ; Lei et 150 al . , 2021a ; Xiao et al . , 2018 ) . Eight compartments and three transmission routes were 151 considered in the study . The virus is emitted into the room air ( compartment 1 ) in the 152 droplets exhaled by the infector . In this study , the environmental surfaces were divided 153 into two types : porous surfaces , which is typically rough , such as cloth , the bed cover 154 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 surfaces ; and non - porous surfaces , such as the glass table surfaces . Some of the virus 155 in the room air could be deposited on porous ( compartment 2 ) and non - porous surfaces 156 ( compartment 3 ) , infector hands ( compartment 4 ) , exhausted by ventilation 157 ( compartment 5 ) , and inhaled by susceptible individuals ( compartment 6 ) . The virus 158 can be transferred between porous / non - porous surfaces and the infector’s or susceptible 159 individuals’ hands ( compartment 7 ) during hand - to - surface contact . The virus on the 160 hands of susceptible individuals could be transmitted to the mucus membranes and lead 161 to infection transmission ( compartment 8 ) . Detailed model and the parameterization 162 were summarized in Supplementary Information Part 1 Model and Parameterization . 163 164 165 Figure 1 . The exposure pathway model in a household environment . 166 167 Airborne route model 168 For airborne route , we assumed that the airborne droplets were uniformly distributed in 169 room air . On one hand , the infector could exhale virus - contained airborne droplets into 170 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 room air , on the other hand , the virus - contained airborne droplets could be removed via 171 ventilation , natural inactivation and deposition on horizontal environmental surface . We 172 elected not to consider virus inhalation by individuals in the household and deposition 173 on the vertical environmental surface during the 1 - day simulation period because of 174 their negligible contribution . Then the concentration of droplet nuclei in room air 175 ( 𝐶 𝑎 ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) ) can be calculated by equation ( 1 ) . 176 177 𝑑 ( 𝐶 𝑎 ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) ) 𝑑𝑡 = 𝐺 𝑖 ( 𝑟 0 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 0 ) − ( 𝑞 + 𝑏 𝑎 + 𝑘𝑟 2 ) 𝑉𝐶 𝑎 ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) ( 1 ) 178 where 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 0 ) is the concentration of virus in the droplets with initial radius 𝑟 0 ; 𝑞 is 179 the ventilation rate of the room , 𝑏 𝑎 is the inactivation rate of SARS - CoV - 2 in air , 𝑉 is 180 the room volume , and 𝑘𝑟 2 quantifies the deposition rate of droplets with particle size 181 𝑟 on the horizontal environmental surface . 𝐺 𝑖 ( 𝑟 0 ) is the generation rate of droplets of 182 radius 𝑟 0 exhaled by the infector . The total number of droplets generated by the 183 infector per hour corresponds to 𝑁 𝑑 ; droplet size distribution is 𝑓 ( 𝑟 0 ) , and 𝐺 𝑖 ( 𝑟 0 ) = 184 𝑁 𝑑 𝑓 ( 𝑟 0 ) . At a steady state , ( 𝑑 ( 𝐶 𝑎 ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) ) 𝑑𝑡 = 0 ) , there is 185 186 𝐶 𝑎 ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑁 𝑑 𝑓 ( 𝑟 0 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 0 ) / [ ( 𝑞 + 𝑏 𝑎 + 𝑘𝑟 2 ) 𝑉 ] ( 2 ) 187 Then the airborne exposure dose ( 𝐷 𝑎 ) of a susceptible person during 𝑇 𝑎 exposure time 188 can be calculated by equation ( 3 ) : 189 190 𝐷 𝑎 = ∫ ∫ 𝑝𝐶 𝑎 ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) 4 3 𝑟 𝑎 0 𝑇 𝑎 0 𝜋𝑟 3 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑟𝑑𝑡 ( 3 ) 191 where 𝑟 𝑎 is the largest radius of respirable droplets , 𝑝 is the pulmonary ventilation rate . 192 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 𝑟 0 is the initial radius of the droplet immediately after exhalation . We assume that the 193 final radius 𝑟 after complete evaporation is 𝑟 = 𝑟 0 / 3 ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) . 194 195 Droplet route model 196 There are two main droplet transmission routes : ( 1 ) inhalation of the virus carried in 197 inspirable droplets with diameters between 5 and 50 𝜇𝑚 ( Nicas and Jones , 2009 ; Lei 198 et al . , 2018 ) . These inspirable droplets are mainly deposited in the upper respiratory 199 tract ; and ( 2 ) droplet spray of virus - containing droplets onto the facial membranes of 200 susceptible individuals during talking and coughing . It was assumed that the trajectory 201 of the droplets exhaled by the infector formed a jet , and the cone angle formed by the 202 jet is 𝛼 , the mucosal area of a person is 𝐴 𝑚 , at a horizontal distance of S ( S ≤ 2 m ) from 203 the infector , the virus concentration in the droplet is : 204 205 𝐶 𝑑 ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) = 𝐺 𝑖 ( 𝑟 0 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 0 ) / ( 𝑝 ( 𝜋 ( 𝑆 ∙ 𝑡𝑎𝑛 ( 𝛼 2 ) ) 2 ) ) ( 4 ) 206 207 We assume that the exposure time of susceptible individuals in the droplet transmission 208 route is 𝑇 𝑑 . The exposure dose caused by inhalation is : 209 210 𝐷 𝑑𝑖 = ∫ ∫ 𝑝𝐶 𝑑 ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) 4 3 𝑟 𝑏 5 𝑇 𝑑 0 𝜋𝑟 3 𝑑𝑟𝑑𝑡 ( 5 ) 211 212 where 𝑟 𝑏 is the maximum radius of the inspirable droplets . Small droplets with particle 213 sizes less than 10 μm evaporated completely before being inhaled by the susceptible 214 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 person , however , large droplets may not evaporate completely when inhaled by a 215 susceptible person ; thus , 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) is determined by the evaporation time and inhalation 216 time of susceptible persons . Assuming that 𝑡 𝑚 ( 𝑆 ) is the traveling time for the exhaled 217 droplets from the source to reach a susceptible person a distance S away , 𝑡 𝑒 ( 𝑟 0 ) is the 218 evaporation time for the droplets with radius 𝑟 0 . 219 220 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) = { 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 0 ) 𝑡 𝑚 ( 𝑆 ) < 𝑡 𝑒 ( 𝑟 0 ) 0 . 25𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 0 ) 𝑡 𝑚 ( 𝑆 ) ≥ 𝑡 𝑒 ( 𝑟 0 ) ( 6 ) 221 Xie et al . ( 2006 ) studied the evaporation time of droplets with different diameters using 222 a fitting function , 𝑡 𝑒 ( 𝑟 0 ) = 7 × 10 −4 𝑟 02 was used in this study . 𝑡 𝑚 ( 𝑆 ) = 𝑆 / 𝑉 𝑚 , where 223 𝑉 𝑚 is the droplet speed after exhalation . The exposure dose by spraying onto the mucous 224 membrane is 225 226 𝐷 𝑑𝑠 = ∫ ∫ 4 3 𝑟 𝑐 / 2 5 𝑇 𝑑 0 𝜋𝑟 3 𝐴 𝑚 𝐶 𝑑 ( 𝑟 , 𝑡 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑟𝑑𝑡 ( 7 ) 227 228 Where 𝑟 𝑐 is the maximum radius of the exhaled droplets . 𝐴 𝑚 is the area of mucous 229 membranes . The average interpersonal distance between two individuals ( S ) during 230 talking was set as 0 . 81 m ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . 231 232 Contact route model 233 By assuming the uniformly distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 on environmental surfaces and 234 hands after each touch , the time varying SARS - CoV - 2 concentrations on each 235 environmental surface and hand can be calculated via ordinary differential equations , 236 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 which had been used in previous literatures ( Plipat et al . , 2013 ; Lei et al . , 2017 ; Lei et 237 al . , 2020b ) . In this study , the environmental surfaces were divided into two types , i . e . , 238 porous and non - porous surfaces . Virus on hands could be removed by hand hygiene and 239 natural inactivation . And we assumed there was no surface cleaning during the 1 - day 240 simulation period . 241 242 Assuming that 1 % of the virus exhaled by the infector deposits by droplet spread on the 243 infector’s hands , the rate of virus deposition on the infector ' s hand 𝐺 ℎ is 244 245 𝐺 ℎ = 0 . 01 ∫ 𝑁 𝑑 𝑓 ( 𝑟 0 ) 𝐿 ( 𝑟 0 , 0 ) 4 3 𝜋𝑟 03 𝑟 𝑐 / 2 5 𝑑𝑟 0 ( 8 ) 246 Viruses on the hands also lose activation and are removed by hand hygiene . The natural 247 inactivation rate of the virus on hands is represented by  h . Hand hygiene frequency 248 was assumed to be 𝑐 ℎ𝑦 and hand hygiene efficiency was assumed to be 𝑒 ℎ𝑦 . Hand 249 hygiene ( 𝑒 ℎ𝑦 ) is considered to remove 90 % of the virus ( Temime et al . , 2009 ) . To 250 represent the discrete hand hygiene process in the continuous governing ordinary 251 differential equations , we made the following translation . After hand hygiene , only a 252 fraction ( 1 – 𝑒 ℎ𝑦 ) of the viruses remained on the hands . Hand hygiene occurs 𝑐 ℎ𝑦 times 253 per hour , and the time - averaged rate of pathogen removal due to hand hygiene is 254 denoted by  ℎ𝑦 . On average , if there is 1 – 𝑒 ℎ𝑦 = 𝑒  ℎ𝑦 / 𝑐 ℎ𝑦 , then  ℎ𝑦 = −log ( 1 – 90 % ) 𝑐 ℎ𝑦 255 ( Lei et al . , 2020b ) . 256 257 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 At the steady state , the amount of virus on the patient ' s hands 𝑛 𝑖𝑝 ̅̅̅̅ is 258 259 𝑛 𝑖𝑝 ̅̅̅̅ = 𝐺 ℎ  ℎ +  ℎ𝑦 ( 9 ) 260 Assuming the infector and the susceptible adult touch the environmental surface with 261 rate 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑠 , and the susceptible child touch the environmental surface with rate 𝑐 𝑝2 , 𝑠 , 262 the frequency of hand - to - hand contact between the infector and the susceptible adult 263 is 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 , and that between the infector ( and the susceptible adult ) and the susceptible 264 child is 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝1 . Then , the amount of virus on the 𝑖 th susceptible individual ' s hand , 265 𝑛 𝑝𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) ( 𝑖 = 1 for the adults , 𝑖 = 2 for the child ) , and the k th environmental surface , 266 𝑛 𝑠𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) ( 𝑘 = 1 represents a porous surface , 𝑘 = 2 represents non - porous surface ) , can be 267 calculated by equations ( 10 - 12 ) : 268 269 𝑑𝑛 𝑝1 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 = ∑ 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑠 𝛼 𝑠𝑘 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑠 𝐴 𝑠𝑘 𝑛 𝑠𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) 2𝑘 = 1 + 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝1 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑝1 𝐴 𝑝1 𝑛 𝑖𝑝 ̅̅̅̅ + 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝐴 𝑝2 𝑛 𝑝2 ( 𝑡 ) − ( ∑ 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑠 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑠𝑘 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑠 𝐴 𝑝1 2𝑘 = 1 + 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝1 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑝1 𝐴 𝑝1 + 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝐴 𝑝1 +  ℎ +  ℎ𝑦 ) 𝑛 𝑝1 ( 𝑡 ) ( 10 ) 𝑑𝑛 𝑝2 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 = ∑ 𝑐 𝑝2 , 𝑠 𝛼 𝑠𝑘 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝2 , 𝑠 𝐴 𝑠𝑘 𝑛 𝑠𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) 2𝑘 = 1 + 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝐴 𝑝1 𝑛 𝑖𝑝 ̅̅̅̅ + 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝐴 𝑝1 𝑛 𝑝1 ( 𝑡 ) − ( ∑ 𝑐 𝑝2 , 𝑠 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑠𝑘 𝐴 𝑐𝑝2 , 𝑠 𝐴 𝑝2 2𝑘 = 1 + 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝐴 𝑝2 + 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑝2 𝐴 𝑝2 +  ℎ +  ℎ𝑦 ) 𝑛 𝑝2 ( 𝑡 ) ( 11 ) 𝑑𝑛 𝑠𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑠 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑠𝑘 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑠 𝐴 𝑝1 ( 𝑛 𝑖𝑝 ̅̅̅̅ + 𝑛 𝑝1 ( 𝑡 ) ) + 𝑐 𝑝2 , 𝑠 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑠𝑘 𝐴 𝑐𝑝2 , 𝑠 𝐴 𝑝2 𝑛 𝑝2 ( 𝑡 ) − ( 2𝑐 𝑝1 , 𝑠 𝛼 𝑠𝑘 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑠 𝐴 𝑠𝑘 + 𝑐 𝑝2 , 𝑠 𝛼 𝑠𝑘 , 𝑝 𝐴 𝑐𝑝2 , 𝑠 𝐴 𝑠𝑘 +  𝑛𝑠𝑘 ) 𝑛 𝑠𝑘 ( 𝑡 ) , k = 1 , 2 . ( 12 ) 270 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 where 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑠𝑘 ， 𝛼 𝑠𝑘 , 𝑝 and 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑝 represent the transmission efficiency of the virus from 271 the hand to the k th environmental surface , from the k th surface to hand , and from hand 272 to hand , respectively . 𝐴 𝑝𝑖 , 𝐴 𝑠𝑘 , 𝐴 𝑐𝑝𝑖 , 𝑠 , and 𝐴 𝑐𝑝1 , 𝑝𝑖 represent the area of the 𝑖 th 273 susceptible individual ' s hand , area of the 𝑘 th environmental surface , contact area 274 during hand - to - environmental surface contact , and contact area during hand - to - hand 275 contact , respectively .  𝑛𝑠𝑘 is the inactivation rate of the virus on the k th environmental 276 surface . We assumed that hand washing and surface cleaning are performed at a certain 277 frequency at certain time points . 278 279 Then , the total exposure dose of 𝑖 th susceptible individual via the contact route at the 280 exposure time 𝑇 𝑐 can be calculated by equation ( 13 ) : 281 282 𝐷 𝑐 , 𝑝𝑖 = ∫ 𝑐 𝑝𝑖 , 𝑚 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑚 𝐴 𝑓 , 𝑝𝑖 𝐴 𝑝𝑖 𝑛 𝑝𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑑𝑡 𝑇 𝑐 0 ( 13 ) 283 where 𝑐 𝑝𝑖 , 𝑚 is the contact rate on the mucous membrane of 𝑖 th susceptible individual , 284 𝛼 𝑝 , 𝑚 is the transmission efficiency of the virus from the hand to mucous membranes , 285 and 𝐴 𝑓 , 𝑝𝑖 is the contact area between the hands and mucous membranes of the 𝑖 th 286 susceptible individual . 287 288 Detailed model parameterization were summarized in Supplementary Information Part 289 1 Model Parameterization . 290 291 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 Infection risk assessment 292 The negative exponential dose - response model ( Lei et al . , 2018 ) was used to estimate 293 the infection risk , which implies that a single particle can start an infection and that all 294 single particles are independent of each other . The infection risk of individual during 1 - 295 day exposure can be calculated according to the following equation : 296 297 𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒 −𝜂 𝑙 𝐷 𝑎 −𝜂 𝑢 𝐷 𝑑𝑖 − 𝜂 𝑚 𝐷 𝑑𝑠 − 𝜂 𝑚 𝐷 𝑐 ( 14 ) 298 299 where 𝜂 𝑙 , 𝜂 𝑢 , and 𝜂 𝑚 are the dose - response rates in the lower respiratory tract , upper 300 respiratory tract , and mucous membranes , respectively . To the best of our knowledge , 301 a dose - response relationship for both SARS - CoV - 2 ancestral and Omicron variant as a 302 cause of SARS - CoV - 2 has not been reported . Therefore , in this study , we assumed that 303 the dose - response rates for the ancestral and Omicron variants were the same . Animal 304 experiments have suggested that airborne transmission is more efficient than fomite 305 transmission ( Port et al . , 2021 ) . Recent findings on SARS - CoV - 2 also revealed that 306 angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 , which is used to infect humans , is expressed in the 307 nose at higher levels than in the lower respiratory tract with a ratio of difference 308 approximately 4 : 1 ( Hou et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , this is a case of 𝜂 𝑙 ≥ 𝜂 𝑚 . In this study , 309 we assume that 𝜂 𝑙 : 𝜂 𝑢 : 𝜂 𝑚 = 100 : 1 : 1 ( Mizukoshi et al . , 2021 ) , Although the 100 : 1 310 ratio for infectivity in the lower respiratory tract and upper respiratory tract / mucous 311 membranes may be an overestimate , we set the 100 : 1 ratio mainly based on the data 312 on influenza virus in humans ; for influenza , there is 𝜂 𝑙 : 𝜂 𝑚 = 1000 : 1 ( Couch and 313 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 Kasel , 1983 ; Nicas and Jones , 2009 ) . For adults , 𝜂 𝑚 = 2 . 46 × 10 −3 , which was the 314 dose - response rate for SARS - CoV - 2 , and was also the best available model in the 315 present study ( Mizukoshi et al . , 2021 ) . For children , the dose response rates were 316 assumed to be half of those for adults , since studies have reported that susceptibility to 317 SARS - CoV - 2 increases with age ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ; Lei et al . , 2021b ) . The detailed 318 model parameterization is summarized in the Supplementary Information Part 1 Model 319 Parameterization . 320 321 Virus shedding by the infector 322 For both Omicron and ancestral variant , SARS - CoV - 2 infected individuals shed viruses 323 into the environment via respiratory activities such as breathing , talking , coughing , and 324 sneezing . The proportion of asymptomatic / presymptomatic infections is high in SARS - 325 CoV - 2 transmission ( Yanes - Lane et al . , 2020 ) . We defined ‘asymptomatic’ as an 326 individual with laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection but without symptoms 327 throughout their entire course of infection , or after 14 days of follow up ; and ‘pre - 328 symptomatic’ as an individual who reports no symptoms at the time of the initial 329 positive test result , but who subsequently develops symptoms attributable to COVID - 330 19 , i . e . , during the incubation period ( Qiu et al . , 2021 ) . In this study , we considered the 331 following two scenarios : 1 ) asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , where infected 332 individuals shed viruses into the environment via breathing and talking . 2 ) 333 Symptomatic infection , where infected individuals shed viruses into the environment 334 via breathing , talking , and coughing . Detailed size distribution of droplets from 335 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 breathing , talking and coughing were in Supplementary Information Part 1 . 336 337 During asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , we assumed that 49 . 5 % and 49 . 5 % of 338 the droplets exhaled by the patient were partitioned into porous and non - porous surfaces , 339 respectively , and the remaining 1 % would be deposited on the infector’s hands . During 340 symptomatic infection , we assumed that 89 % and 10 % of the droplets exhaled by the 341 patient were partitioned into porous and non - porous surfaces , respectively ( Mizukoshi 342 et al . , 2021 ) , as the infected individuals would lie in bed most of the time . The 343 remaining 1 % was deposited in the hands of the infector . The viral load in 344 nasopharyngeal swabs peaked 1 d before symptom onset , with values of 8 – 9 log10 345 RNA copies per mL , and then decreased exponentially ( Néant et al . , 2021 ; Wyllie et al . , 346 2020 ) . Thus , in this study , in asymptomatic / presymptomatic infections , the viral 347 concentration in the droplets was set from 10 5 to 10 9 RNA copies per mL , and in 348 symptomatic infections , the viral concentration was set from 10 4 to 10 8 RNA copies per 349 mL . 350 351 Sensitivity analysis 352 Some parameters had uncertainties that could not be controlled by the scenario settings . 353 Thus , we performed the sensitivity analysis of these uncertain parameters , including 354 hand - to - surface contact rate , hand hygiene frequency , dose response rates and 355 proportion of virus deposition on different surfaces , which were summarized in 356 Supplementary Information Part 2 : Sensitivity Analysis . 357 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 358 Results 359 Estimation of the infection risk 360 The risks of each pathway and the overall risk depended on the virus concentration in 361 saliva ( Figure 2 ) . Under the same conditions , the overall infection risk was albeit 362 slightly higher for the Omicron strain than for the ancestral strains ( Figure 2 ) . This was 363 mainly because of the assumption that Omicron variant had higher dose response rates 364 than the ancestral strains due to its higher infectivity . With higher dose - response rates , 365 the infection risk of the Omicron variant would be higher ( Supplementary Information 366 Part 3 Figure S5 ) . When the salivary virus concentration was 10 4 – 10 8 RNA copies / mL , 367 the overall infection risk for the susceptible child was approximately half of that of the 368 susceptible adult , as the dose response rate of the child was set as half of that of the 369 adult , but when the salivary virus concentration was 10 9 RNA copies / mL , the overall 370 infection risks were close to 1 for both the susceptible child and the adult . During 371 asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , for the susceptible child , the overall infection 372 risk was 2 . 2 × 10 - 4 for salivary virus concentration of 10 5 RNA copies / mL , 2 . 2 × 10 - 2 for 373 salivary virus concentration of 10 7 RNA copies / mL , and 0 . 89 for salivary virus 374 concentration of 10 9 RNA copies / mL . For the susceptible adult , the overall infection 375 risk was 4 . 4 × 10 - 4 for salivary virus concentration of 10 5 RNA copies / mL , 4 . 3 × 10 - 2 for 376 salivary virus concentration of 10 7 RNA copies / mL , and 0 . 99 for salivary virus 377 concentration of 10 9 RNA copies / mL . During symptomatic infection , for the 378 susceptible child , the overall infection risk was 2 . 3 × 10 - 4 for salivary virus concentration 379 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 19 of 10 4 RNA copies / mL , 2 . 3 × 10 - 2 for salivary virus concentration of 10 6 RNA copies / mL , 380 and 0 . 90 for salivary virus concentration of 10 8 RNA copies / mL . For the susceptible 381 adult , the overall infection risk was 4 . 7 × 10 - 4 for salivary virus concentration of 10 4 382 RNA copies / mL , 4 . 6 × 10 - 2 for salivary virus concentration of 10 6 RNA copies / mL , and 383 0 . 99 for salivary virus concentration of 10 8 RNA copies / mL . When the infector was 384 symptomatic , the infector was expected to produce a much larger number of droplets 385 than during asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , as expected by the addition of 386 cough to the modes of infector droplet generation . However , the peaked virus 387 concentration in the saliva was supposed to be lower . Thus , the peaked overall infection 388 risk of two susceptible individuals with asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection was 389 close to that of symptomatic infection , which suggests that 390 asymptomatic / presymptomatic infections could contribute to approximately 50 % of 391 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . 392 393 394 ( A ) ( B ) 395 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 20 396 ( C ) ( D ) 397 398 ( E ) ( F ) 399 400 ( G ) ( H ) 401 Figure 2 .

For both strains , the dominant routes during 410 asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection were different from those during symptomatic 411 infection . When the infector was asymptomatic / presymptomatic , all three routes 412 contributed a role in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ( Figure 3A , 3B ) . Contact route 413 contributed the most ( 37 % – 45 % ) , followed by the airborne route ( 34 % – 38 % ) and 414 droplet route ( 21 % – 28 % ) . When the infector was symptomatic , the droplet route was 415 the dominant pathway ( 48 % – 71 % ) , followed by the contact route ( 25 % – 42 % ) . The 416 airborne route played a negligible role ( < 10 % ) . Compared to the ancestral strain , 417 although the contributions of the contact route increased in Omicron variant 418 transmission , the increase was slight ( Figure 3 ) . Further , the sensitivity analysis showed 419 that the slight increase in the contribution of contact route in SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron 420 variant transmission compared with the ancestral strain was robust to the key 421 parameters in the model ( Supplementary Information Part 2 Sensitivity Analysis ) . 422 423 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 22 424 ( A ) 425 426 ( B ) 427 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 23 428 ( C ) 429 430 ( D ) 431 Figure 3 .

Left : ancestral strain ; Right : Omicron strain . 435 436 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 24 We also explored the relative contributions of direct and indirect contact routes to the 437 contact transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Figure 4 ) . The indirect contact route dominated 438 the contact transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in households . This may be mainly because 439 the frequency of hand - to - environmental surface contact ( 3 times per hour ) was much 440 higher than the frequency of hand - to - hand contact ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 times per hour ) , and the 441 hand hygiene frequency was also high , at 0 . 5 / h ; however , environmental surfaces were 442 not considered to be clean , so the virus concentration on environmental surfaces was 443 higher than that on the hands ( Supplementary Information Part 3 , Figure S5 ) . Because 444 of the relatively higher hand - to - hand contact between the susceptible child and the 445 infector , the direct contact route contributed more in contact transmission of SARS - 446 CoV - 2 for the susceptible child than that for the susceptible adult ( Figure 4 ) . 447 448 ( A ) 449 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 25 450 ( B ) 451 452 ( C ) 453 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 26 454 ( D ) 455 Figure 4 .

Left : ancestral strain ; Right : 459 Omicron strain . 460 461 Discussion 462 The emergence of the new coronavirus variant strain , Omicron , has led to a rapid 463 increase in the proportion of asymptomatic infections , making it more difficult to 464 prevent infection and control the pandemic . To control the transmission of SARS - CoV - 465 2 , the relative importance of the different pathways should be quantified , to determine 466 the effective non - pharmaceutical interventions . In this study , based on our current 467 knowledge about SARS - CoV - 2 and its related information , we calculated SARS - CoV - 468 2 infection risk through multiple pathways of exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 in the context 469 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 27 of a prototypical household and estimated the relative contribution of each pathway to 470 transmission . We found that the relative importance of different routes varied between 471 asymptomatic / presymptomatic and symptomatic infections . During 472 asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , all three routes contributed a role . During 473 symptomatic infection , the droplet route was the dominant pathway ( 48 % – 71 % ) and 474 the airborne route played a negligible role ( contribution < 10 % ) . The main reason for 475 this is that , during asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , SARS - CoV - 2 is mainly 476 emitted via breathing and talking , and most droplets emitted from breathing are 477 respirable droplets with diameters less than 10 µm . When the infector developed 478 symptoms , most viruses were emitted from coughing , since the volume of saliva from 479 coughing was much larger than that from breathing . Droplets from coughing had a 480 relatively larger size , so most exhaled droplets were deposited on environmental 481 surfaces and inhaled by susceptible individuals via the droplet route . With the emerging 482 concern about the increase in the proportion of asymptomatic / presymptomatic 483 infections due to the Omicron strain ( Garrett et al . , 2022 ) , evaluating the relative 484 importance of different transmission routes in asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection 485 is critical for SARS - CoV - 2 prevention . In addition , in both 486 asymptomatic / presymptomatic and symptomatic infections , although the SARS - CoV - 487 2 Omicron variant was more stable on various environmental surfaces than the ancestral 488 strain , the contribution of the contact route to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission increased 489 slightly for the Omicron variant . 490 491 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 28 Previous studies have explored the relative contributions of different routes to SARS - 492 CoV - 2 ancestral variant transmission via both animal models ( Bao et al . , 2020 ) and 493 mathematical models ( Jones , 2020 ; Mizukoshi et al . , 2021 ) . In the animal experiment 494 study , the absolute risks of airborne , droplet , and overall risk were 0 , 3 / 10 , and 7 / 13 , 495 respectively ; thus , considering the inclusion and exclusion of contact transmission , the 496 estimated contributions of airborne , droplet , and contact routes could be 0 % , 57 % , and 497 43 % , respectively . This tendency is consistent with the results obtained when the 498 infector was symptomatic . The modelling studies conducted by Jones ( 2020 ) and 499 Mizukoshi et al . ( 2021 ) both considered virus emission via coughing ; the study by Jones 500 ( 2020 ) considered virus emission solely via the coughing as a possible action for spread . 501 Jones found that the droplet and airborne routes predominated , contributing 35 % and 502 57 % , respectively , in hospitals . Mizukoshi et al . ( 2021 ) found that the airborne route 503 was much less important than the contact route and droplet route , only contributing 504 4 % – 10 % of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in hospitals . This is consistent with the results 505 obtained when the infector was symptomatic . In addition , Mizukoshi et al . ( 2021 ) found 506 that the role of the droplet route decreased with an increase in salivary virus 507 concentration , contributing 65 % – 70 % when the virus concentration was 10 1 – 10 4 / mL , 508 and 20 % – 46 % when the virus concentration was 10 5 – 10 8 / mL . When the virus 509 concentration was low , the estimated contribution of the contact route was consistent 510 with the results of this study ( 67 % – 71 % ) . However , when the virus concentration was 511 high , the estimated 20 % – 46 % contributions were much lower than those in this study 512 ( 48 % – 71 % ) . The main reason for this could be that the estimated overall risk in the 513 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 29 study by Mizukoshi et al . ( 2021 ) was much higher than our estimation under the same 514 salivary virus concentration . When the infection risk by contact route was high , with 515 further rapid increase in salivary virus concentration , the infection risk by contact route 516 would increase slowly , while infection risk via other routes would still increase quickly ; 517 thus , the contribution of the contact route was relatively decreased . The relatively low 518 overall infection risk in this study was mainly due to the relatively small volume of 519 droplets considered to be exhaled by talking ( 0 . 16 VS 3 . 2 × 10 −4 mL saliva per 100 s 520 speaking ) and coughing ( 4 . 4 × 10 −2 VS 8 . 1 × 10 −3 mL per cough ) . 521 522 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission through fomites has been demonstrated in animal model 523 studies ( Bao et al . , 2020 ; Sia et al . , 2020 ; Port et al . , 2021 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 has been 524 detected on various surfaces ( Guo et al . , 2020 ; Mondelli et al . , 2020 ) . In long - term care 525 facilities with COVID - 19 patients , SARS - CoV - 2 concentrations on environmental 526 surfaces ranged from 1 . 3 to 3661 . 2 genomes / cm 2 , with median values at 76 . 6 527 genomes / cm 2 ( Dumont - Leblond et al . , 2021 ) . The estimated virus concentration on the 528 environmental surfaces in this study was similar to the results of field measurements . 529 The transmission of microns of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron via packaging has attracted 530 widespread attention . Because the virus inactivation of the Omicron variant is lower 531 than that of the ancestral strain ( Chin et al . , 2022 ) , concerns are rising about a significant 532 increase in contact transmission risk . Since both Omicron and ancestral variants survive 533 well on environmental surfaces , hand hygiene plays a key role in restricting contact 534 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . In our study , we found that the role of the contact route 535 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 30 increased slightly in Omicron variant transmission , by no more than 5 % . Therefore , 536 contact transmission is should not be the cause of excessive concern . In contrast , we 537 found that , with the increase in asymptomatic / presymptomatic infections in Omicron 538 strain transmission ( Garrett et al . , 2022 ) compared with the ancestral strain , the airborne 539 route should gain more attention in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and prevention . When 540 the infector was symptomatic , the airborne route played a negligible role ( < 10 % ) , but 541 this pathway becomes important ( 34 % – 38 % ) when the infector is 542 asymptomatic / presymptomatic . 543 544 This study had several limitations . First , the results depend on the model assumptions . 545 For example , the relative contribution of the droplet route is dependent on the emission 546 of the virus in respirable droplets and the exposure time of susceptible individuals . 547 Hand hygiene frequency and efficiency affected the results related to contact route . 548 However , the real - life effect and variables relating to these parameters remain unclear . 549 To improve the accuracy of the model , the data pertaining to SARS - CoV - 2 should be 550 updated in future studies . Second , it should be noted that the scenario we assume at 551 home is relatively simple ; we only consider close contact distance ( 0 . 81 m between two 552 individuals , and contacts of infected and susceptible individuals were only considered 553 for 30 min of conversation ) . In reality , there are more complex activities , such as dining 554 together , that may increase the risk of the droplet and contact routes . In other public 555 places such as shopping malls and restaurants , the dominant route may be different ; 556 thus , we would study further scenarios of the other settings . Lastly , the behavioral 557 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 31 settings of susceptible adults and susceptible children are the same ; however , children 558 may touch more surfaces and wash their hands less often , which may lead to a higher 559 risk of contact transmission . In a word , the overall risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection 560 predicted by the mathematical model should be interpreted with caution , though the 561 result comparisons are informative . 562 563 Conclusions 564 In SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron strain transmission , concern about the increase in the 565 proportion of asymptomatic / presymptomatic infections and the airborne route , rather 566 than the fomite route , should receive much attention ; interventions such as increased 567 ventilation should be recommended for Omicron strain transmission prevention . 568 569 CRediT authorship contribution statement 570 Shuyi Ji : Writing – original draft , Writing – review & editing , Software , Methodology , 571 Formal analysis , Data curation .

Model parameterization 779 1 . 1 Shedding Parameter . When infected individuals shed , they release some 780 pathogens into the environment . SARS - CoV - 2 infected individuals shed viruses into 781 the environment via respiratory activities such as breathing , talking , coughing , and 782 sneezing . The proportion of asymptomatic / presymptomatic infections could reach 57 . 5 % 783 ( Yanes - Lane et al . , 2020 ) . In this study , we considered the following two scenarios : 1 ) 784 asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , where infected individuals shed viruses into 785 the environment via breathing and talking . Breathing and talking for 2 min would expel 786 2 . 4 × 10 −6 and 7 . 1 × 10 −2 mL saliva , respectively . During 787 asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , we assumed that 49 . 5 % and 49 . 5 % of the 788 droplets exhaled by the patient were partitioned into porous and non - porous surfaces , 789 respectively , and the remaining 1 % would be deposited on the infector’s hands . 2 ) 790 Symptomatic infection , where infected individuals shed viruses into the environment 791 via breathing , talking and coughing . One cough would expel 0 . 17 mL saliva , and the 792 cough frequency was determined to be 30 per hour . During symptomatic infection , we 793 assumed that 89 % and 10 % of the droplets exhaled by the patient were partitioned into 794 porous and non - porous surfaces , respectively ( Mizukoshi et al . , 2021 ) , as the patient 795 would lie in bed most of the time . The remaining 1 % was deposited in the hands of the 796 infector . Detailed size distributions of droplets from breathing , talking , and coughing 797 are provided in Supplementary Information Part 1 . The viral load in nasopharyngeal 798 swabs peaked 1 d before symptom onset , with values of 8 – 9 log10 RNA copies per mL , 799 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 42 and then decreased exponentially ( Néant et al . , 2021 ; Wyllie et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , in this 800 study , in asymptomatic / presymptomatic infections , the viral concentration in the 801 droplets was set from 10 5 to 10 9 RNA copies per mL , and in symptomatic infections , 802 the viral concentration was set from 10 4 to 10 8 RNA copies per mL . To examine this 803 process , we considered the 1 ) shedding event frequency , such as breathing , talking , and 804 coughing ; 2 ) number of droplets emitted per shedding event ; 3 ) size distribution of the 805 shedding droplets ; 4 ) pathogen concentration in the shedding droplets . 806 807 1 ) Breathing , talking , and coughing frequency 808 In asymptomatic / presymptomatic infections , the infector shed viruses into the 809 environment via breathing and talking . Breathing lasted 24 hours , and talking between 810 the infector and the susceptible child last 30 minutes per day , and talking between the 811 infector and the susceptible adult also last 30 minutes per day . In symptomatic 812 infections , besides shedding virus via breathing and talking with same frequency to the 813 situation in asymptomatic / presymptomatic infections , the infector also coughs with 814 frequency 12 / h ( Nicas and Jones , 2009 ) . 815 2 ) number of droplets emitted per shedding event and 3 ) size distribution of the 816 shedding droplets ; 817 For breathing , 2 minutes naturally paced breathing , in through the nose and out through 818 the nose could produce around 8000 droplets , with size ranged from 0 μ m to 20 μ m 819 ( Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . The droplets size distribution follows a lognormal distribution 820 ( Miller et al . , 2022 ) , i . e . 821 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 43 lognorm ( log ( 1 . 614 ) , log ( 1 . 3 ) ) ( 1 ) 822 Thus , the saliva volume per 2 minutes of breathing was set to be 2 . 4 × 10 −8 mL . 823 For talking , the counting from ‘1’ to ‘100’ ( assuming a speed of counting of 1 count per 824 1 second , then counting from ‘1’ to ‘100’ lasted 100 seconds ) could produce about 100 - 825 2794 droplets , with average value at 760 droplets ( Xie et al . , 2009 ) . The droplets size 826 ranged from 0 . 8 μ m to 1000 μ m ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) , and the size distribution 827 follows the sum of three following lognormal distributions ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) , i . e . 828 ( lognorm ( log ( 1 . 614 ) , log ( 1 . 3 ) ) + lognorm ( log ( 2 . 4 ) , log ( 1 . 66 ) ) + lognorm ( log ( 145 ) , 829 log ( 1 . 795 ) ) ) / 3 ( 2 ) 830 Thus , the saliva volume per 100 s of talking was estimated to be 1 . 8 × 10 −3 mL saliva , 831 a little higher than the estimated 3 . 2 × 10 −4 mL saliva counting from ‘1’ to ‘100’ in the 832 study by Chen et al . , ( 2020 ) . However , Mizukoshi and his colleagues estimated that the 833 30s talking could produce 0 . 05 mL saliva ( Mizukoshi et al . , 2021 ) , 92 times of our 834 estimation . So our estimation was intermediate . 835 For coughing , one cough could produce about 4973 particles ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) , with 836 size ranged from 0 . 8 μ m to 1000 μ m ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . And the size distribution 837 follows the sum of the following three lognormal distributions ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) , 838 i . e . 839 ( lognorm ( log ( 1 . 568 ) , log ( 1 . 25 ) ) + lognorm ( log ( 1 . 6 ) , log ( 1 . 68 ) ) + lognorm 840 ( log ( 123 . 3 ) , log ( 1 . 837 ) ) ) / 3 ( 3 ) 841 Thus , the saliva volume per cough was set to be 8 . 1 × 10 −3 mL , close to the estimated 842 7 . 55 × 10 −3 mL saliva per cough in the study by Chen et al . , ( 2020 ) . In the study by 843 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 44 Nicas and Jones ( 2009 ) , the estimated saliva volume per cough was 4 . 4 × 10 −2 mL . 844 So , our estimation was intermediate . 845 846 Figure 1 . Size distribution of the droplets from breathing , talking and coughing 847 respectively . 848 4 ) Virus concentration in the shedding droplets . 849 Regarding the SARS - CoV - 2 concentration in the saliva , To et al . ( 2020 ) firstly reported 850 the salivary virus concentration specimens of 11 patients , with median value 3 . 3 × 10 6 851 copies / mL ( ranged from 9 . 9 × 10 2 to 1 . 2 × 10 8 copies / mL ) . Wyllie et al . ( 2020 ) reported 852 the mean salivary virus concentration was 10 5 . 58 copies / mL with range from < 10 4 to > 853 10 10 . The viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs peaked 1 d before symptom onset , with 854 values of 8 – 9 log10 RNA copies per mL , and then decreased exponentially ( Néant et 855 al . , 2021 ; Wyllie et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , in this study , in asymptomatic / presymptomatic 856 infections , the viral concentration in the droplets was set from 10 5 to10 9 RNA copies 857 per mL , since when the virus is lower than 10 5 RNA copies per mL , the infection risk 858 is very low ( Mizukoshi et al . , 2021 ) . And in symptomatic infections , the viral 859 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 45 concentration was set from 10 4 to 10 8 RNA copies per mL , an order of magnitude lower 860 than the virus concentration during asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection . 861 862 1 . 2 Virus inactivation parameter . In this study , the environmental surfaces were 863 divided into two types : porous surfaces , such as the bed cover surfaces ; and non - porous 864 surfaces , such as the glass table surfaces . We used a simple first - order process to model 865 the inactivation of virus in the environment . 866 Several studies had reported the SARS - CoV - 2 virus survival on environmental surfaces 867 ( Chin et al . , 2020 ; Pastorino et al . , 2020 ; Hirose et al . , 2021 ) , however , experimental 868 environment such as temperature and humidity , which could influence the survival of 869 viruses , may be different in different studies . Chin et al . , ( 2022 ) studied the survival of 870 Omicron variant and ancestral strain on various surfaces under same environmental 871 setting . In this study , the virus inactivation rate was estimated by the survival time of 872 Omicron variant and ancestral strain on surfaces in the study by the Chin et al . , ( 2022 ) . 873 The SARS - CoV - 2 ancestral strain inactivation rate on porous surfaces was estimated to 874 be 0 . 32 / h , on non - porous surfaces 0 . 043 / h . The SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron strain 875 inactivation rate on porous surfaces was estimated to be 0 . 083 / h , on non - porous 876 surfaces 0 . 0091 / h . The ancestral strain inactivation rate on hands was estimated to be 877 0 . 21 / h ( Hirose et al . , 2021 ) . No study had reported the Omicron strain inactivation rate 878 on skin , since the Omicron strain inactivation rates on porous and non - porous surfaces 879 were about 1 / 4 of ancestral strain inactivation rates on porous and non - porous surfaces , 880 respectively . Therefore , in this study , we simply assumed the Omicron strain 881 inactivation rate on hands is about 1 / 4 of ancestral strain inactivation rate on hands , at 882 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 46 0 . 05 / h . The ancestral strain inactivation rates in air was estimated to be 0 . 22 / h ( Van 883 Doremalen et al . , 2020 ) . For Omicron strain , we also assumed that the inactivation rates 884 in air was 1 / 4 of the ancestral strain , at 0 . 055 / h . 885 886 1 . 3 Transfer efficiency parameters . Depending on the material of the environmental 887 surfaces , the transfer efficiency during contact varies widely . To the best of our 888 knowledge , there was no data on the transfer efficiency of SARS - CoV - 2 between hand 889 and hand / surfaces during hand - to - hand / surface contact . Therefore , in this study , we 890 used the transfer efficiency of SARS coronavirus and influenza A H1N1 , since SARS 891 coronavirus , influenza A H1N1 and SARS - CoV - 2 were all respiratory viruses . 892 We used 27 % with constraints for the virus transfer efficiency from hand to non - porous 893 surface ; studies have shown that this parameter ranges from 13 . 6 % to 44 . 6 % , with a 894 mean of 27 % ( Lopez , 2013 ) . We used 29 % with constraints for the virus transfer 895 efficiency from non - porous surface to hand , as studies have shown that this parameter 896 ranges from 15 % to 61 . 5 % , with a mean of 29 % ( Lopez , 2013 ) . As the porous surfaces 897 in this study were cloth , which is typically very rough ; the transfer efficiency might be 898 similar for different types of microorganisms . Therefore , the transfer efficiency for E 899 coli , S aureus , and B . thuringiensis under low relative humidity was used . The transfer 900 efficiency for these three microorganisms from cotton to hand ranged from 0 . 3 % to 901 15 . 4 % with a mean of 3 % ( Lopez et al . , 2013 ) . We used 3 % for the virus transfer 902 efficiency from porous surface to hand . We used 81 % for the virus transfer efficiency 903 from hand to porous surface , as the transfer efficiency from hand to fabric ranged from 904 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 47 17 % to 88 % with a middle value of 81 % ( Mackintosh and Hoffman , 1984 ) . The virus 905 transfer efficiency from hand to membrane during self - membrane touching was 906 assumed to be 36 % , as studies have shown that this value ranges from 34 % to 41 % , 907 with a mean value of 36 % ( Rusin et al . , 2002 ) . 908 909 1 . 4 Contact behaviors in household . In the household , the mean direct body - to - body 910 contact rate between adults ( father - mother ) was 1 . 2 per day , the father or mother - to - 911 child contact rate was 2 . 6 and 5 . 9 per day ( Miura et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , in this study , 912 the activity time during one - day simulation was set as 9 : 00am - 21 : 00pm , the direct 913 body - to - body contact rate between the infector and the susceptible adult was set as 0 . 1 / h 914 ( 1 . 2 / 12 ) , and the direct body - to - body contact rate between the infector and the 915 susceptible child was set as 0 . 5 / h ( 5 . 9 / 12 ) . The hand contact rate on environmental 916 surfaces in household was estimated from one observation study in student office , in 917 which , the mean hand - to - surface contact rate was 3 / h ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , 918 in this study , the hand - to - surface contact rates for both adults and children were set as 919 3 / h . In the sensitivity analysis , the hand - to - surface frequency at 2 / h and 4 / h were used . 920 The mean frequencies of handwashing per day before and during the COVID - 19 921 pandemic were 2 . 9 and 8 . 9 times per day ( Sayeed et al . , 2021 ) , In this study , we 922 assumed the handwashing frequency is 6 per day , mean value of handwashing 923 frequency before and during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Since in this study , the activity 924 time during one - day simulation was set as 9 : 00am - 21 : 00pm , so the handwashing 925 frequency was set as 6 / 12 = 0 . 5 per hour , and hand hygiene efficiency was 90 % ( Temime 926 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 48 et al . , 2009 ) , which means 90 % of the virus on hands would be removed after 927 handwashing . And in the sensitivity analysis , the hand hygiene frequency at 0 . 25 / h and 928 0 . 75 / h were used . 929 930 Table S1 summarized the parameters used in the model . 931 Table S1 .

Sensitivity Analysis 934 We performed the sensitivity analysis of the following 4 parameters , i . e . , including 935 hand - to - surface contact rate , hand hygiene frequency , dose response rates and 936 proportion of virus deposition on different surfaces . 937 2 . 1 . Sensitivity analysis of hand - to - surface contact rates . 938 To assess the impact of hand - to - surface contact rates on the results , the hand - to - surface 939 contact frequency at 2 / h and 4 / h were set . Our baseline for hand - to - surface contact 940 frequency was 3 / h . With hand - to - surfaces contact frequency at 2 / h , 3 / h and 4 / h , the 941 increased contributions of contact route in Omicron strain transmission were all slight , 942 less than 5 % ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . 943 944 ( A ) ( B ) 945 946 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 54 ( C ) ( D ) 947 Supplementary Figure S1 .

Sensitivity analysis of hand hygiene frequency . 953 To assess the impact of hygiene frequency on the results , a hand hygiene frequency of 954 0 . 25 / h and 0 . 75 / h was used , at baseline , the hand hygiene frequency was set at 0 . 5 / h . 955 With the increase of hand hygiene frequency , it was reasonable to find that contact route 956 would play a less important role in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , so with low hand 957 hygiene frequency ( 0 . 25 / h ) , the increased contributions of contact route in Omicron 958 strain transmission compared with the ancestral strain were more ( Supplementary 959 Figure S2 ) . But with hand hygiene frequency at 0 . 25 / h , 0 . 5 / h and 0 . 75 / h , the increased 960 contributions of contact route in Omicron strain transmission were still slight , less than 961 6 % . 962 963 ( A ) ( B ) 964 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 55 965 ( C ) ( D ) 966 Supplementary Figure S2 .

Sensitivity analysis of dose response rates . 973 To assess the impact of dose response rates on the results , different dose response rates 974 were set for the Omicron variant . At baseline , for the SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant , 975 the dose response rates in the lower respiratory tract , upper respiratory tract and mucous 976 membranes were 𝜂 𝑚 = 𝜂 𝑢 = 2 . 46 × 10 −3 and 𝜂 𝑙 = 2 . 46 × 10 −1 , which are the same 977 variables as those of the ancestral strain . Because the Omicron variant has a higher 978 infectivity than the ancestral strain , in the sensitivity analysis , 𝜂 𝑚 = 𝜂 𝑢 = 5 × 10 −3 , 979 𝜂 𝑙 = 5 × 10 −1 , and 𝜂 𝑚 = 𝜂 𝑢 = 1 × 10 −2 , 𝜂 𝑙 = 1 values were set . With the increase 980 of dose response rates for the Omicron strain , when the virus concentration in saliva 981 was high , then the infection via contact route would be high , with further increase in 982 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 56 salivary virus concentration , the infection via contact route would increase slowly , 983 while other routes with less contribution would increase quickly . In summary , the 984 increased contributions of contact route in Omicron strain transmission compared to the 985 ancestral strain were still less than 10 % ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . 986 987 ( A ) ( B ) 988 989 ( C ) ( D ) 990 Supplementary Figure S3 .

Sensitivity analysis of virus deposition on different surfaces . 996 To assess the impact on the results virus deposition on different surfaces would have , 997 during asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , the proportion of virus exhaled by the 998 infector deposited on porous surfaces was set to 69 . 5 % and 29 . 5 % , respectively ; thus , 999 the proportion of virus deposited on non - porous surfaces was set to 29 . 5 % and 69 . 5 % , 1000 respectively . At baseline , during asymptomatic / presymptomatic infection , we assumed 1001 that 49 . 5 % and 49 . 5 % of the virus - containing droplets exhaled by the infector were 1002 partitioned into porous and non - porous surfaces , respectively . With more virus 1003 deposited on porous surfaces , the virus transfer rate from porous surface to hand was 1004 much lower than the transfer rate from non - porous surface to hand , thus , with more 1005 virus deposited on porous surfaces , the contribution of fomite route to SARS - CoV - 2 1006 transmission became less . So , it was reasonable to find that with more virus deposited 1007 on porous surfaces , the increased contribution of contact route in Omicron strain 1008 transmission compared to the ancestral strain became less ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . 1009 1010 ( A ) ( B ) 1011 Supplementary Figure S4 .
