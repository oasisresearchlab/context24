In turn , cytoskeletal proteins contribute to the filament - based 20 network responsible for controlling adipocyte ' s shape and promoting the intracellular trafficking of 21 key cellular components . Currently , our understanding of these mechanisms remains incomplete . In 22 this study , we identified the non - muscle myosin 10 ( MYH10 ) as an important regulator of 23 adipogenesis and adipocyte function through its interaction with the insulin dependent , Glucose 24 transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) . MYH10 depletion in preadipocytes resulted in impaired adipogenesis , with 25 knockdown cells exhibiting disrupted morphology and reduced molecular adipogenic signals . MYH10 26 was shown to be in complex with GLUT4 in adipocytes , an interaction regulated by insulin induction . 27 The missing adipogenic capacity of MYH10 - KD cells was restored when they uptook GLUT4 vesicles 28 up from neighbor wild - type cells in a co - culture system . Our results provide the first demonstration 29 that MYH10 interacts with GLUT4 in cells and adipose tissue through the insulin pathway . The 30 signaling cascade is regulated by the protein kinase C ζ ( PKCζ ) , which interacts with MYH10 to mo dify 31 the localization and interaction of both GLUT4 and MYH10 in adipocytes as PKCζ inhibition resulted in 32 reduced GLUT4 and MYH10 translocation and interactions . Overall , our study establishes MYH10 as 33 an essential regulator of GLUT4 translocation , affecting both adipogenesis and adipocyte function , 34 highlighting its importance in future cytoskeleton - based studies in adipocytes . 35 Keywords : MYH10 , GLUT4 , PKC ζ , adipogenesis , cytoskeleton organization , insulin signaling 36 3 Introduction 37 The process of adipocytes differentiation is termed adipogenesis . It is a well - coordinated process 38 orchestrated by morphological and molecular changes in the cells and their niche . Specific physical , 39 molecular , and chemical pathways promote the commitment of mesenchymal cells to preadipocytes 40 and later to mature adipocytes through a series of sequential inter - dependent events 1 , 2 . During 41 adipogenesis , the cells undergo substantial morphological changes that are crucial for their 42 commitment to a lineage - specific fate 3 , 4 . These changes are organized by cytoskeletal components 43 responsible for determining and maintaining cellular shape and function and are a prerequisite for 44 the induction of adipogenic signaling 5 – 9 . In addition , cytoskeletal proteins are also involved in the 45 terminal differentiation phase and the insulin signaling pathway , where they are needed as a filament - 46 based network for translocation of glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) and other related processes 10 – 15 . 47 GLUT4 is an insulin - dependent glucose transporter expressed mainly in the brain , muscle cells , and 48 adipocytes 16 , 17 . Reduced GLUT4 translocation and reduced membranal expression , specifically in 49 adipose tissue , is associated with diabetes , insulin resistance , and lowered glucose sensitivity 18 , 19 . In - 50 vitro , GLUT4 expression is upregulated during adipogenesis , and knockdown of GLUT4 in 51 preadipocytes can interfere with their differentiation 20 , 21 . GLUT4 is packed in storage vesicles ( GLUT4 52 storage vesicles : GSVs ) that are found in the cytoplasm . Upon stimulation , these GSVs are 53 translocated to the cell membrane , where they uptake glucose 16 , 17 . The translocation process is highly 54 synchronized by a variety of kinases and cytoskeletal proteins that undergo rapid reorganization to 55 promote shuttling of GSVs to the cell membrane 11 , 13 , 22 . Some of the most significant cytoskeletal 56 components associated with GLUT4 translocation are myosins , where different types of myosins 57 interact with both the actin network and the GSVs to facilitate the shuttling process 23 – 29 . 58 Non - muscle myosin II ( NMII ) proteins are vital cytoskeletal components that are ubiquitously 59 expressed in a variety of cell types . The three NMII mammalian paralogs ( A - C ) , encoded by the MYH9 , 60 MYH10 , and MYH14 genes respectively , differ in their expression profiles , and play both unique and 61 overlapping roles 30 , 31 . These proteins interact with actin filaments and are associated with 62 intracellular forces , organelle shuttling , cell adhesion , directional motility , and morphogenesis 30 , 32 . 63 The NMII proteins also play a role in the cytoskeletal organization of stress fibers and anchor the cells 64 4 to the substrate 33 , 34 . However , despite extensive research addressing the roles of NMII , it remains 65 unclear at the conceptual level how the specific expression profile of MYH10 in individual cells is linked 66 to cell physiology . While a variety of myosin types are implicated in adipocyte metabolism , little is 67 known about the role of MYH10 in adipocytes and adipogenesis . Previous studies have reported that 68 MYH10 is expressed in adipocytes 29 , 35 – 38 , and we have previously demonstrated the association of 69 reorganized actin filaments and other candidate proteins , including MYH10 , in adipocyte 70 differentiation 6 . However , the mechanism of action and function of MYH10 in adipocytes has never 71 been studied . 72 Here , we generated a knockdown model of MYH10 in preadipocytes in order to examine its effects 73 on adipogenesis and adipocyte function . The results identify MYH10 as a possible regulator of 74 adipogenesis in 3T3 - L1 cells . They also reveal the presence of MYH10 in a complex with GLUT4 that is 75 regulated by insulin . The interaction with GLUT4 was proven crucial for adipogenesis as the lack of 76 adipogenic capacity of MYH10 knockdown cells was restored by transportation of GLUT4 from 77 neighboring cells . Moreover , our results indicate that the MYH10 : GLUT4 complex is regulated by PKC ζ , 78 a protein kinase C associated with insulin signaling and cytoskeleton reorganization 39 , 40 . This is the 79 first study to show the importance of MYH10 in adipogenesis and adipocyte function and can serve 80 as the foundation for future MYH10 based studies in adipocytes . 81 Methods and Materials 82 Animals : Epididymal visceral adipose tissues were taken from C57bl / 6J mice and used as fresh and 83 frozen tissues for further procedures . The mice were kept in a conventional facility with 12 h 84 light / dark cycles and were fed with standard chow and provided water ad libitum . Animal care and 85 experiments were in accordance with the guidelines of the IACUC Approval ( 01 - 21 - 044 ) . 86 Cell lines : Mouse embryonic 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes ( American Type Culture Collection ) were 87 cultured and differentiated as was previously described 41 . For insulin induction , differentiated 3T3 - L1 88 cells were incubated in a Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) without glucose for one hour 89 ( Biological Industries , Israel ) , and then replaced with a GM with and without 5µg / ml insulin for 5 - 30 90 minutes . To inhibit PKCζ activity , a myristoylated pseudo - substrate inhibitor for PKCζ ( Santa Cruz , SC 91 - 397537 ) was added at 50µM to the starvation and induction phases of insulin induction . 92 5 Lentivirus production and transduction : Lentiviruses were produced as was previously described 42 . 93 The pLenti - myc - GLUT4 - mCherry expressing lentivirus plasmid was a gift from Weiping Han ( Addgene 94 plasmid # 64049 ; http : / / n2t . net / addgene : 64049 ; RRID : Addgene _ 64049 ) 43 . The MYH10 pCMV - 95 GFPH2B lentiviral plasmid ( Clone ID ; TRCN0000110555 ) was a gift from Chen Luxenburg , Tel Aviv 96 University , Tel Aviv , Israel . 44 The lentivirus particles were produced by the transfection of cultured 97 HEK293FT cells ( Invitrogen ; R70007 ) with the lentivirus expression plasmid and helper plasmids [ pLP1 , 98 pLP2 , and VSV - g ( Invitrogen ) ] . The supernatant was collected after one and 2 - days post - transfection . 99 Cultured 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes were infected control ( Scr ; H2B - GFP ) or gene - specific lentiviruses with 100 Polybrene ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at a final concentration of 100µg / ml . 101 Co - culturing : For the GLUT4 + : MYH10 - KD 3T3 - L1 co - culture , GLUT4 + cells were seeded first , and 102 after one day , the MYH10 - KD cells were added to all wells . The culture was then differentiated as 103 described . The PKH26 : MYH10 - KD co - cultures 3T3 - L1 cells were labeled with 0 . 5λ PKH26 Fluorescent 104 Cell Linker Kit ( Sigma‐Aldrich ) ; the GFP cells were added after one day . 105 Immunofluorescence staining : Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described in Mor - 106 Yosef Moldovan et al 6 . Shortly , the cells were fixed with a 4 % paraformaldehyde solution , 107 permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton in 1 % TBST , and then blocked with a blocking solution ( 1 % TBST 108 containing 1 – 2 % normal goat serum and 1 % BSA ) . Next , the cells were incubated overnight with 109 primary MYH10 ( Santa Cruz ; SC - 376942 ) and GLUT4 ( Santa Cruz ; SC - 53566 ) antibodies , washed , and 110 incubated with secondary antibodies , Cy3 - anti - mouse ( 115 - 165 - 003 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch 111 Laboratories ) , Alexa Fluor 555 anti - Mouse IgG1 ( Invitrogen ; A - 21127 ) , and Alexa Fluor 488 anti - 112 Mouse IgG2b ( Invitrogen ; A - 21141 ) for one additional hour . F‐actin filaments were stained with 113 fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled phalloidin ( P5282 ; Phalloidin‐FITC ; Sigma‐Aldrich ) . The stained 114 coverslips were mounted on slides with Fluoroshield™ mounting medi um containing 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 115 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) . Images were acquired by a confocal microscope ( Leica SP8 ; Leica , Wetzlar , 116 Germany ) and a fluorescence microscope ( Nikon , Eclipse Ci ) . 117 Whole - mount staining : Adipose tissue whole - mount staining was performed as previously 118 described 45 . Briefly , isolated murine epididymal adipose tissues were fixated in 1 % paraformaldehyde 119 in 24 - wells plates . The tissues were then washed and blocked with a blocking buffer ( PBS - 0 . 3T with 120 6 5 % normal goat serum ) . Blocked tissues were incubated overnight with primary MYH10 ( Santa Cruz ; 121 SC - 376942 ) and GLUT4 ( Santa Cruz ; SC - 53566 ) antibodies . Next , the tissues were incubated with 122 secondary antibodies , Alexa Fluor 555 anti - Mouse IgG1 ( Invitrogen ; A - 21127 ) , and Alexa Fluor 488 123 anti - Mouse IgG2b ( Invitrogen ; A - 21141 ) and washed again before adding the Fluoroshield™ mounting 124 medium DAPI . Images were acquired by a confocal microscope ( Leica SP8 ; Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . 125 Image processing and analysis tools : ImageJ was used to analyze and process the 126 immunofluorescence pictures . Cytoskeleton quantification : MYH10 filaments distribution analysis 127 was done as previously described 6 . Shortly , the images were analyzed with the FIJI ImageJ software 128 ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) using two plugins . OrientationJ 46 was used to quantify the coherency of the cells , 129 and the Ridge detection plugin 47 , 48 was used to calculate the length and number of junctions of each 130 cell . Membranal / cytoplasmatic ratio quantification : Membranal / cytoplasmatic and 131 cortical / cytoplasmatic ratios were calculated as previously described 49 . The mean membranal and 132 cytoplasmatic intensities were extracted by using the method . The mean membranal intensity was 133 divided by the mean membranal intensity to extract the ratio of cells . 134 Live microscopy : All live imaging was performed using EVOS FL Auto 2 microscope ( Invitrogen ) . 135 Adhesion assay : Suspended 3T3 - L1 cells were seeded in six wells and were immediately transferred 136 to the EVOS microscope . Phase - contrast images were taken at 3 , 15 - and 33 minutes post - seeding . 137 Fiji ImageJ ' s Trainable Weka segmentation plugin 50 was used to separate the cells and background in 138 each image . Every cell in each field was marked , and its area was calculated using ImageJ . Migration 139 assay : The migration of cells was assessed by manual track of single cells using time - lapse images . 140 The cells were observed for three hours , and images were taken at ten minutes intervals . Trajectories 141 of the migration paths were calculated using the manual cell tracker plugin in ImageJ . Each cell 142 nucleus in the image sequence was manually marked for each frame . Then the created trajectories 143 were used to generate the vectors and calculate the motility data . Accumulative distance and average 144 speed were calculated for each trajectory . Wound healing assay : Cultured confluent ( 90 % ) 145 monolayer of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes were scratched with a tip . The cells were then observed under 146 the EVOS microscope and measured at 0 , 4 , 8 , and 12 hours and at the time of closure . The relative 147 closure gap was calculated as the ratio of the current gap relative to the gap at the starting point . The 148 experiment was repeated three times for each group . 149 7 Adipogenesis assays : Images of cultured 3T3 - L1 cells throughout differentiation were taken in order 150 to follow the cell ' s growth , morphology and LDs accumulation . Level of adipogenesis : The Level of 151 adipogenesis was calculated as previously described 51 . Shortly , Stitched phase - contrast x40 images 152 of differentiated cultures were taken after 21 days post - adipogenesis induction . Based on the major 153 visual difference between fibroblasts and adipocytes a visual difference mapping ( VDM ) was 154 obtained . The map was used to calculate the level of adipogenesis ( LOA ) in each culture . Lipid droplet 155 quantification and morphological analysis : Phase contrast Images at a magnification of x400 of 156 differentiating cultures were taken 21 and 28 days post - induction . The LDs radius and cell projected 157 area were analyzed using an image - processing - based method developed by Lustig et al 51 . 158 Immunoblotting : The procedures and analyses were performed according to the standard protocols 159 ( www . protocol - online . net ) . Cells were harvested from cultures , washed with ice‐cold PBS , and lysed 160 in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl buffer containing 1 mM EDTA , 1 % NP‐40 and protease inhibitors : 161 [ phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 1 mM ; 1‐chloro‐3‐tosylamido‐4‐phenyl‐2‐butanone , TPCK , 10 162 µg / ml ; aprotinin , 10 µg / ml ( Sigma‐Aldrich ) ] . Protein concentration was determined with BCA Protein 163 Assay Kit ( Pierce 23225 ) . Samples were re - suspended in Laemmli buffer , separated on 7 . 5 % SDS – 164 PAGE gel , and transferred to nitrocellulose . After blocking the membranes were incubated overnight 165 with a primary antibody , anti – MYH10 ( Santa Cruz ; SC - 376942 ) . Primary antibody was washed 4 times 166 for 5 min with TBST and followed by incubation with Peroxidase Anti - Mouse IgG ( Jackson Immuno 167 Research ) in blocking solution . Peroxidase signal was detected with chemiluminescent substrate 168 ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) using Fusion FX7 ( Vilber Lourmat ) . Coimmunoprecipitation Whole - cell lysates 169 ( 200µg ) were incubated with Protein A / G Plus Agarose ( Santa Cruz , SC - 2003 ) and an anti - GLUT4 ( SC - 170 53566 ) antibody overnight . The samples were washed and dissolved in Laemmli buffer . 171 Mass spectrometry : Mass spectrometry data was analyzed based on our data base that was 172 previously described 6 173 RNA isolation and qPCR : Total RNA was extracted from 3T3 - L1 cells ( EZ RNA kit , Biological 174 Industries , Beit Haemek , Israel ) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using High - Capacity cDNA Reverse 175 Transcription Kit ( Applied biosystems ) .

Phosphorylation 182 partners analysis was performed using the PathwatNet website 53 . The top fifty candidate genes were 183 extracted and compared with Insulin pathway signaling pathway proteins ( GO : 0008286 ) that were 184 extracted from the gene ontology database 54 – 56 . 185 Statistical analysis : Statistical analyses were analyzed by GraphPad Prism v . 8 . 1 . 1 . Results are 186 presented as means ± SEM . All results were tested for normal distribution by Kolmogorov - Smirnov 187 test , and outliers were identified using the ROUT method . Statistical differences comparing the mean 188 values were tested using two - tailed , unpaired t - tests or one way - ANOVA where appropriate . Values 189 that were not normally distributed were tested using Mann - Whitney or Kruskal - Wallis ( for three or 190 more groups ) , followed by Dunn ' s post - test for multiple comparisons . A value of p < 0 . 05 was 191 considered statistically significant . 192 Schematic illustrations : were created by Bio Render software https : / / biorender . com 193 194 195 9 Results 196 MYH10 distribution is altered during adipogenesis in 3T3 - L1 cells . 197 A previous study from our lab examined the association between changes in cell morphology and the 198 reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton 6 . As part of the analysis , we examined the distribution of 199 actin fibers during adipogenesis and identified the non - muscle myosin isoform ( MYH10 ) as a potential 200 cytoskeletal protein that may impact the function of adipocytes which led us to examine the role and 201 function of MYH10 in adipocytes . Immunostaining of MYH10 ( red ) and F - actin ( green ) in 202 undifferentiated 3T3 - L1 cells showed a colocalization pattern of the filaments as part of the 203 actomyosin cytoskeleton , indicating a mutual role in undifferentiated ( UD - F ) cells ( Fig . 1A ) . In order 204 to examine whether MYH10 filaments undergo reorganization during adipogenesis in UD - F cells , we 205 compared the distribution of MYH10 in UD - F and differentiated cells ( Diff ) . The results indicated a 206 substantial difference in the binary images of MYH10 during differentiation , where the organized 207 filamentous - like form distributed evenly throughout the cell in undifferentiated cells was disrupted 208 and predominantly located in a cortical ring around the cell membrane once the cells differentiated 209 ( Fig . 1B ) . This prompted us to examine the dynamic nature of MYH10 reorganization during the 210 differentiation of adipocytes . Comparison of MYH10 in cells at different stages in the same culture 211 revealed that the coherency in UD - F was significantly higher than in Diff ( 0 . 14 and 0 . 016 , respectively ) , 212 with more junctions than in Diff cells . Moreover , the MYH10 filaments in UD - F were 1 . 7 times longer 213 in the undifferentiated cells ( Fig . 1C ) . These observations suggest that , like actin , MYH10 undergoes 214 significant reorganizations during adipogenesis . 215 MYH10 knockdown model . 216 As the next stage in exploring the effect of MYH10 on adipocyte function , we generated an shRNA - 217 MYH10 knockdown system in 3T3 - L1 cells infected with an shRNA - MYH10 lentivirus containing a 218 histone 2B green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) marker ( MYH10 - KD ) . The knockdown efficacy was tested 219 by qPCR , which confirmed a substantial decrease in MYH10 levels ( Fig . 2A ) . Knockdown efficacy was 220 also examined by analyzing the percentage of transfected cells ( GFP + ) and examining the intensity of 221 cytoplasmatic MYH10 in the GFP + cells . The results indicated that 80 % of cells in the culture were GFP 222 positive , and that these cells exhibited lower levels of cytoplasmatic MYH10 ( Fig . 2B ) . 223 10 MYH10 KD affects cell motility and migration . 224 Since MYH10 is known to play roles in cell migration and adhesion , we assessed the effect of its 225 depletion on cell adhesion and motility in knockdown ( KD ) 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes and cells infected 226 with a scrambled construct ( scrambled ) . Figure 3A presents the differences in adhesiveness between 227 the cultures . After 33 minutes of adhesion , the cell projected area of control scrambled cells was 2 . 5 - 228 fold higher than for KD cells , suggesting a possible effect of MYH10 on cell spreading and adhesion in 229 preadipocytes ( Fig . 3B ) . Next , we examined the impact of MYH10 KD on cell migration . The results of 230 a wound - healing assay ( illustrated in fig . 3D ) , with the relative scratch gap measured after 4 , 8 , and 231 12 hours , revealed a significantly larger gap at the endpoint in MYH10 KD cells than scrambled cells 232 ( 40 % vs . 8 % respectively , Fig . 3C , D ) . With respect to migration , the average speed and accumulated 233 distance of individual KD cells were reduced by more than 20 % , demonstrating the effect of MYH10 234 on the motility of the cells ( Fig . 3E , F ) . Figure 3G presents representative images of the trajectories of 235 cells after 1 and 3 hours . These data support the suggestion that MYH10 is a key factor in adhesion 236 and migration . 237 MYH10 knockdown affects adipogenesis . 238 In order to assess the effect of MYH10 on adipogenesis , scrambled and KD cultures were 239 differentiated to adipocytes and the level of adipogenesis was evaluated after 21 and 28 days . As can 240 be seen in Figure 4A , C , knockdown cultures displayed a lower LOA than the scrambled cultures ; KD 241 cells exhibited little to no adipogenesis , and the fraction of differentiated cells were primarily due to 242 the WT ( Wild type ; GFP - ) cell population in the culture . Quantification of the LOA ( the percentage of 243 adipocytes in the culture relative to the scrambled cells ) confirmed the reduction in adipogenesis in 244 the knockdown cells ( Fig . 4B ) . With respect to adipogenesis - related morphologic parameters , 245 scrambled cells had a significantly greater cell area than the MYH10 KD cells ( 1800 μm 2 versus 520 246 µm 2 , respectively ) . They also had larger lipid droplets ( 3 . 3 μm in the scrambled cells compared to 247 1 . 5 μm , respectively ( Fig . 4E ) ) . Both the cell area and size of lipid droplets rose significantly between 248 day 21 and day 28 of differentiation , but only in the scrambled cells , suggesting that adipogenesis 249 ceased mid - differentiation in the KD cultures . Figure 4F presents the reduction in the expression of 250 principal adipogenic markers in the knockdown cultures , with significant downregulation of all 251 11 measured markers ( PPAR γ , GLUT4 , IRS1 , LPL , and CD36 ) . This observation supports the results of a 252 lack of adipogenesis due to the knockdown of MYH10 , and together , these data strongly suggest a 253 major role for MYH10 in adipocyte differentiation . 254 Co - expression of glucose transporter 4 and MYH10 . 255 While MYH9 , an MYH10 paralog , is known to interact with GLUT4 and was shown to affect its 256 intracellular translocation , this aspect of MYH10 has never been extensively studied . Immunostaining 257 of MYH10 and GLUT4 in murine visceral adipose tissue revealed a similar cortical / membranal 258 expression pattern in mature adipocytes ( Fig . 5A ) . Co - immunoprecipitation of adipose tissue 259 preparations with GLUT4 followed by a western blot with MYH10 demonstrated an association 260 between the two proteins and suggested the presence of a GLUT4 : MYH10 complex in the tissue ( Fig . 261 5B ) . As for adipose tissue , immunofluorescence staining in 3T3 - L1 cells demonstrated colocalization 262 of MYH10 and GLUT4 , particularly in the cell membrane and the cortical area of the cells ( Fig . 5C ) . 263 Similarly , GLUT4 and MYH10 also co - immunoprecipitated from differentiated 3T3 - L1 cells , indicating 264 that the proteins exist together in a complex both in - vivo and in - vitro ( Fig . 5D ) . Mass spectrometry of 265 undifferentiated and differentiated adipocytes revealed the expected differential expression of 266 glucose transporters . GLUT1 is expressed in fibroblasts , and the level increases in adipocytes , while 267 GLUT4 is expressed only by differentiated adipocytes , highlighting the importance of GLUT4 in 268 adipogenesis ( Fig . 5E ) . These data suggest that the effect of MYH10 on adipogenesis may be related 269 to the interaction with GLUT4 . 270 MYH10 colocalization and interaction with GLUT4 is induced by insulin . 271 Since GLUT4 translocation is insulin - dependent , we examined the changes in the expression and 272 localization of MYH10 in response to insulin . After differentiation , 3T3 - L1 cells were starved for one 273 hour and then induced with insulin for a further 30 minutes . Immunostaining of MYH10 and GLUT4 in 274 induced and uninduced cells revealed that insulin - induction strongly increases the expression of 275 GLUT4 in the membranal compartment . MYH10 exhibited a similar pattern , with prominent 276 expression in the cortical region of stimulated cells ( Fig . 6A ) . Intensity plots also revealed 277 colocalization of MYH10 and GLUT4 after induction ( Fig . 6B ) . The membranal to cytoplasmatic ratio 278 ( MCR ) of GLUT4 was 1 . 5 - fold higher after insulin stimuli , meaning that more GLUT4 was translocated 279 12 to the membrane post - induction ( Fig . 6C ) . Quantification of MYH10 MCR also demonstrated a similar 280 increase post stimulus ( 1 . 48 - fold , Fig . 6C ) . We then examined the effect of insulin induction on total 281 MYH10 expression ; a western blot of MYH10 after 15 and 30 minutes showed no difference in MYH10 282 levels indicating that insulin primarily affects the localization and function but not the expression 283 levels of MYH10 in adipocytes ( Fig 6D ) . Co - immunoprecipitation with GLUT4 followed by a western 284 blot with MYH10 revealed an increase in the MYH10 : GLUT4 complex in cells after insulin induction , 285 implying a functional role for MYH10 in GLUT4 translocation in induced adipocytes ( Fig . 6E ) . Overall , 286 these results indicate that MYH10 is connected to the insulin pathway with a possible effect on GLUT4 287 translocation from the cytoplasm to the cell ' s membrane . 288 GLUT4 + shuttling can restore the adipogenic capacity of MYH10 KD cells . 289 In order to determine whether the adipogenic capacity of MYH10 cells can be restored by the 290 transportation of GLUT4 from neighboring cells , we established a co - culture model of 3T3 - L1 cells 291 expressing a GLUT4 - mCherry ( GLUT4 + ) with MYH10 - KD cells expressing nuclear GFP . The labeled 292 GLUT4 ( red ) in GLUT4 + enables us to track the movement of GLUT4 between cells and analyze cell - to - 293 cell interactions . Co - cultures of GFP Scramble cells with the preadipocytes stained with PKH26 red 294 fluorescent dye or marked GLUT4 + cells were used to examine the basic cell - to - cell interaction model . 295 The results presented in Fig . 7A clearly show the uptake of red - labeled particles by the GFP + cells in 296 both cases . Phase - contrast images of differentiated GLUT4 + and MYH10 - KD monocultures 297 demonstrated their disparate adipogenic capacity ( Fig . 7B ) . Images of the differentiated co - cultures 298 revealed numerous GFP + adipocytes filled with GLUT4 - mCherry staining ( Fig . 7C ) . Unsurprisingly , the 299 LOA of co - cultures of MYH10 - KD and GLUT4 + was higher than GFP + cells alone ( Fig . 7D ) . Strikingly , the 300 number of differentiated GFP + cells per field was significantly higher in the co - culture ( average of 4 301 compared to < 1 in the GFP culture , Fig . 7E ) . These results may suggest that labeled GLUT4 is taken 302 up by GFP + cells to compensate for the lack of GLUT4 transferred from within the cell to its outer 303 membrane and indicate the presence of cellular communication that can transfer GLUT4 from 304 neighboring cells to support and induce the differentiation of MYH10 - KD cells . 305 13 MYH10 interaction with GLUT4 post insulin induction is mediated by PKCζ . 306 A number of pathways and effectors are known to regulate the function of MYH10 through 307 phosphorylation . We used PathwayNet analysis , a web - based tool for diverse protein - to - protein 308 interactions to identify potential phosphorylation partners of MYH10 in order to better understand 309 its involvement in insulin - induced GLUT4 translocation ( Fig . 8A ) . After retrieving the top PathwayNet 310 phosphorylation candidates , we crossmatched them to the gene ontology list of insulin signaling 311 pathway - related proteins . PKCζ , a protein kinase C protein , was the lead candidate , since it is a known 312 component of the insulin signaling pathway and a potential MYH10 phosphorylation partner . In order 313 to further explore the hypothesis that PKCζ affects MYH10 function , we used a myristoylated pseudo - 314 substrate inhibitor for PKCζ to examine the effect on MYH10 activity . Insulin - induced differentiated 315 3T3 - L1 cells were incubated with and without the inhibitor to examine its effect on MYH10 and GLUT4 . 316 As shown in Fig . 8B - C , insulin induction triggered a ring - like membranal expression of both MYH10 317 and GLUT4 . In contrast , the inhibitor dramatically disturbed the translocation and localization of 318 MYH10 and GLUT4 , resulting in chaotic and disruptive expression of both proteins . 319 Furthermore , MCR analysis revealed a substantial decline in membranal and cortical expression of 320 both GLUT4 and MYH10 , where the MCR was decreased 1 . 7 - fold for GLUT4 , and 2 - fold for MYH10 in 321 the presence of the inhibitor ( Fig . 8D - E ) . Taken together , these results suggest that PKCζ inhibition 322 attenuated cortical MYH10 assembly and GLUT4 translocation to the membrane . Notably , the PKCζ 323 inhibitor also affected the formation of the GLUT4 : MYH10 complex , with fewer complexes formed in 324 the inhibited cells compared to the insulin - induced cells ( Fig . 8F ) . Overall , our results demonstrate the 325 importance of MYH10 in adipocyte function and adipogenesis through its involvement in insulin 326 induced GLUT4 translocation regulated by PKCζ . These results provide important insights into the 327 relationship between insulin signaling , GLUT4 translocation , and cytoskeleton rearrangement , where 328 MYH10 play an essential role . 329 Discussion 330 Differentiation of preadipocytes is a complex process that is associated with changes in cell 331 morphology . The early stages of adipogenesis require extensive remodeling and organization of 332 various cytoskeletal components regulated by changes in the ECM 52 , 57 , 58 , while in latter parts of 333 14 differentiation and general metabolism , these components are key in maintaining the physiological 334 function of the cells 5 , 11 . Nevertheless , our knowledge of such elements and the molecular pathways 335 by which they affect the cells , remains unclear . This study establishes the importance of MYH10 in 336 adipogenesis and adipocyte function , and more specifically , its interaction with GLUT4 and facilitation 337 of translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane as part of the insulin signaling pathway . 338 We initially identified changes in the distribution of MYH10 filaments during the course of 339 adipogenesis . Non - muscle myosins ( NMMs ) are tightly related to actin , and their interaction is known 340 to affect rudimental cellular processes , including morphogenesis and cytokinesis 59 – 61 . The 341 cytoskeleton is vital for determining and maintaining the shape and function of adipocytes , and 342 depolymerization and repolymerization of actin affect both early adipogenesis and terminal 343 differentiation 7 , 58 . Notably , reorganization of other cytoskeletal components has been shown to 344 affect lipogenesis , mitochondrial activity , and glucose uptake in adipocytes 13 – 15 , 62 , 63 . MYH10 filaments 345 were shown to undergo reorganization in a similar fashion to actin filaments 6 , with a stress - fiber - like 346 appearance in preadipocytes , in contrast to the cortical distribution seen in differentiated cells . These 347 findings further support the notion of reorganization of cytoskeletal components as a potential 348 prerequisite step in adipogenesis . They also highlight the association between myosin and actin in 349 cytoskeletal reorganization and the possible importance as regulators of differentiation . 350 Subsequently , we established a knockdown model of MYH10 in 3T3 - L1 cells to examine how depletion 351 of the protein affects preadipocyte and adipocyte functions . First , we assessed the consequences for 352 migration and adhesion in preadipocytes . MYH10 plays an essential role in cell polarization , motility , 353 and migration through the assembly of actomyosin filaments 31 , 32 . Previous in - vivo and in - vitro studies 354 have demonstrated the importance of MYH10 in migration . Impaired motility was reported in MYH10 355 depleted lung carcinoma cell line , glioma cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts 64 , 65 , 66 . In - vivo , MYH10 356 knockout mice exhibited impaired development of cardiac and brain tissue due to impaired cell 357 adhesion and migration 67 – 69 . Our observations of a significant impact of MYH10 knockdown on cell 358 migration and spreading are consistent with those of previous studies . 359 A major finding of this study was that MYH10 has a significant effect on adipogenesis , with knockdown 360 cells displaying no morphological or molecular indications of adipogenesis . The function of MYH10 as 361 15 a regulator of differentiation can probably be attributed to the interaction with other cytoskeletal 362 components such as actin , that together with ECM signaling and modifications , regulate 363 differentiation . Previous studies have reported the importance of MYH10 in the morphogenesis of a 364 variety of organs through regulation of cell shape and ECM remodeling 70 – 72 . However , our study is the 365 first to show the importance of MYH10 in adipocytes as prior research focused mainly on MYH9 , a 366 paralog of MYH10 and a member of the NMM family 25 , 26 , 29 , 37 , 38 , 73 – 75 . Such studies reported that MYH9 367 affects the secretion of adiponectin and the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles through an interaction 368 with actin filaments 26 , 38 , 75 . The relationship between MYH9 and GLUT4 was studied extensively and 369 showed to affect GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in insulin - stimulated 370 adipocytes 25 , 26 , 29 , 37 , 74 , 75 . Moreover , Blebbistatin , a myosin inhibitor that affects both isoforms of 371 NMMs , also inhibited glucose uptake in insulin - stimulated adipocytes 25 , 26 . Although the effect was 372 mainly attributed to MYH9 , these observations prompted us to examine the relationship between 373 MYH10 and GLUT4 . 374 The results presented here , demonstrate that , both in - vitro and in - vivo , MYH10 and GLUT4 exist in a 375 functional protein complex localized in the cell membrane . In addition , they also implicate the 376 involvement of MYH10 in the insulin pathway since induction with insulin altered its localization and 377 interaction with GLUT4 . Since previous studies reported that , in contrast to MYH9 , MYH10 is highly 378 expressed in the cortex of both stimulated and stimulated adipocytes 26 , we used the MCR method to 379 assess the changes in its cortical expression to reveal the upregulation after exposure to insulin . The 380 same method was also used to quantify the MCR as an indicator of membranal expression of GLUT4 49 . 381 The results indicate that MYH10 and GLUT4 are upregulated in response to insulin , both individually 382 and as a complex . We therefore suggest that the insulin dependent GLUT4 translocation to the cell 383 membrane , may be regulated by MYH10 . These results may help us to better understand the 384 overlapping and unique roles of different NMMs , specifically in adipocyte function , and the 385 importance of MYH10 in adipogenesis . 386 The MYH10 knockdown adipogenesis model showed that the WT population in the cultures can 387 induce the differentiation of KD cell , with several differentiated GFP + cells primarily in areas with 388 differentiated WT cells . This finding suggests that the WT population may secrete and transfer factors 389 that induce adipogenesis even in MYH10 - KD cells . Because of the observed interaction between 390 16 GLUT4 with MYH10 , we hypothesized that co - culturing of MYH10 - KD with GLUT4 + cells could have an 391 effect on the adipogenic potential of the MYH10 - KD cells . In this context , adipocytes are known to be 392 able to sense their niche and interact with neighboring cells either directly or indirectly 76 , 77 . Notably , 393 we were able to restore some adipogenic capacity to MYH10 depleted cells by uptake of GLUT4 394 particles from neighboring GLUT4 + cells in co - culture ( Fig . 7C , E ) . The transport of extracellular vesicles 395 containing GLUT4 from other cells , has been reported previously 78 , and this method of cellular 396 communication is of great interest because of its potential in the regulation of adipocyte 397 differentiation and function . 398 The regulation of NMMs differs from that of cardiac and muscle myosins and involves the 399 phosphorylation of regulatory light chains and the tails of the heavy chains themselves 30 , 32 . 400 Phosphorylation of the non - muscle myosin tails can promote the reorganization and localization of 401 actomyosin filaments 79 – 84 . We predicted that some regulators of MYH10 may also be downstream 402 effectors of the insulin pathway and may govern MYH10 activity in that regard . We were able to 403 identify PKCζ as a regulator of MYH10 function in induced adipocytes . Our investigations into potential 404 regulators of MYH10 activity indicated a possible role for PKCζ i n regulating MYH10 activity via the 405 insulin pathway , and indeed , its inhibition impeded MYH10 and GLUT4 activity . PKCζ is an atypical 406 protein kinase C protein that was previously shown to be highly related to the insulin pathway . It is 407 phosphorylated by phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 3 - kinase and , in turn , can phosphorylate various 408 downstream effectors that regulate GLUT4 translocation 39 , 40 . PKCζ also regulates the required 409 cytoskeletal reorganization that accompanies insulin signaling and can affect the polymerization of 410 actin that is crucial for GLUT4 shuttling , placing it at the intersection of insulin signaling and 411 cytoskeleton activity 85 – 87 . The different non - muscle myosins have several overlapping and unique 412 regulators both through their regulatory light chains and heavy chains 30 , 32 . Interestingly , MYH10 is the 413 only non - muscle myosin regulated by PKCζ , which highlights the differences in function and regulation 414 of the different myosin isoforms 79 , 88 , 89 . The reported effects of PKCζ on the cytoskeletal association , 415 mechanoresponsiveness , and cortical localization of MYH10 are in good agreement with our finding 416 that it regulates the localization of MYH10 in response to insulin and that inhibition of PKCζ inhibited 417 MYH10 and GLUT4 activity 79 , 90 . Our observations suggest that PKCζ is phosphorylated as part of the 418 insulin pathway , and in turn , can trigger MYH10 cortical activity that facilitates GLUT4 translocation 419 17 to the membrane because of their interaction ( Fig . 8G ) . The suggested pathway further highlights the 420 strong relationship between cytoskeleton activity and cellular functioning . 421 In conclusion , we have identified MYH10 as a novel effector of adipogenesis and adipocyte function . 422 Our results demonstrate that MYH10 regulates the translocation of GLUT4 through insulin - induced 423 PKCζ activation , and that MYH10 - KD inhibits adipogenesis . These observations further support the 424 importance of cytoskeleton proteins in adipocyte function and differentiation . Future in - vivo studies 425 that incorporate pathophysiological conditions and their effect on MYH10 function in adipocytes will 426 undoubtedly prove informative . 427 Acknowledgments : Mike Egozi participated in the project as part of the jInternship program .
