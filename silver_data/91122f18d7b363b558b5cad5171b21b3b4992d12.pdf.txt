A RT I C L E S ARF1 is directly involved in dynamin - independent endocytosis Sudha Kumari 1 and Satyajit Mayor 1 , 2 Endocytosis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) and the fluid phase takes place primarily through a dynamin - and clathrin - independent , Cdc42 - regulated pinocytic mechanism . This mechanism is mediated by primary carriers called clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) , which fuse to form tubular early endocytic compartments called GPI - AP enriched endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) . Here , we show that reduction in activity or levels of ARF1 specifically inhibits GPI - AP and fluid - phase endocytosis without affecting other clathrin - dependent or independent endocytic pathways . ARF1 is activated at distinct sites on the plasma membrane , and by the recruitment of RhoGAP domain - containing protein , ARHGAP10 , to the plasma membrane , modulates cell - surface Cdc42 dynamics . This results in the coupling of ARF1 and Cdc42 activity to regulate endocytosis at the plasma membrane . These findings provide a molecular basis for a crosstalk of endocytosis with secretion by the sharing of a key regulator of secretory traffic , ARF1 . Internalization of cargo at the cell surface takes place via multiple clath - rin - dependent and independent pathways 1 – 3 . Many of these mechanisms use the large GTPase dynamin to facilitate vesicle fission at the plasma membrane , although other pathways function in its absence . A dynamin - independent , Cdc42 - regulated pinocytic pathway is one such example 4 ; it does not use the coat - proteins , caveolin or clathrin , nor the scission effector , dynamin . Nascent endocytic vesicles ( CLICs ) in this pathway have been recently identified 5 , and they fuse to form early endosomal intermediates , GEECs 4 . This is distinct from the early sorting endosomal compartment which also contains clathrin - dependent endocytic cargo 6 . Although the GEEC pathway is responsible for endocytosis of specific components of the membrane such as GPI - APs and cholera toxin ( CTx ) bound to its ganglioside receptor ( GM1 ) , it also facilitates pinocytosis in a variety of cell lines 4 – 8 . Recently , we have shown that cholesterol - sensitive Cdc42 activa - tion results in recruitment of actin - polymerization machinery to spe - cific foci at the plasma membrane , promoting endocytosis via CLICs into GEECs 9 . This results in an endocytic pathway that is sensitive to perturbations of cholesterol levels and actin polymerization . To date , very few other components of this pathway have been identi - fied . Flotillin1 has been reported to be required for internalization via a clathrin and dynamin independent pathway 10 , and CtBP1 – BARS protein has been implicated in a dynamin - independent pinocytic mechanism 11 . Further downstream , Rab5 and PI ( 3 ) K are recruited to early endocytic intermediates of the GEEC pathway , resulting in fusion with sorting endosomes 6 . The functional significance of endocytosis via GEECs is expanding as we discover both specific cargo and molecular players that participate in this pathway ; for example , folate uptake via GPI - anchored folate recep - tors ( FR - GPI ) , and the internalization of vacuolating toxins such as VacA and aerolysin , are mediated by this pathway 3 , 12 . Taking into account the diverse functions of GPI - AP cargo and the importance of fluid - phase endocytosis for a variety of cellular processes , it is imperative to under - stand the molecular mechanism of the GEEC pathway . Here , we have examined the role of the ADP - ribosylation factor ( ARF ) family of proteins that participate in multiple intracellular trafficking events 13 . Of the many family members 13 , ARF1 and ARF6 are the best characterized . ARF1 has a central role in vesicle formation during early and late secretory traffic 14 , 15 , whereas ARF6 is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton near the cell surface and has been implicated in mul - tiple pathways of endocytosis 16 – 8 . We find that activated ARF1 is present at the plasma membrane and recruits ARHGAP10 , a GAP for Cdc42 , which , in turn , regulates endocytosis via the GEEC pathway . REsuLTs Modulation of ARF1 GTPase activity specifically affects endocytosis via the GEEC pathway ARF1 , a cytosolic GTPase with a relative molecular mass of 21 , 000 ( M r , 21K ) , is recruited to Golgi membranes , where its location in the mem - brane depends on GTP - binding 19 . The GDP - exchange deficient form of ARF1 ( ARF1 T31N ) is primarily cytosolic , and behaves as dominant nega - tive isoform of ARF1 activity when overexpressed 20 .

Endocytosis via the dynamin - dependent pathways , clathrin , caveolin or the RhoA - dependent processes were mon - itored by measuring the extent of endocytosis of fluorescently - labelled transferrin ( Tf ) bound to the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , C 6 - Bodipy - lac - tosylceramide ( C 6 - LacCer ) incorporated into the plasma membrane , or antibodies against the β - subunit of the interleukin 2 receptor ( IL2R - β ) 21 , respectively . Endocytosis via the GEEC pathway was assessed by moni - toring uptake of surface - labelled folate receptor ( FR – GPI ) and TMR - labelled Dextran ( TMR – Dex ) , as probes for GPI - APs and the fluid - phase , respectively . Overexpression of ARF1 T31N resulted in specific inhibition of FR – GPI and TMR – Dex uptake , whereas internalization of Tf ( Fig . 1a ) and C 6 - LacCer ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S1a ) were unaf - fected . Although ARF1 T31N caused a reduction in the surface levels of the IL2R - β , possibly due to its effect on IL2R - β exocytosis , endocytosis of IL2R - β was also unaffected ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S1d ) . The effect of ARF1 T31N on the CLIC – GEEC pathway was not restricted to CHO cells . ARF1 T31N expression inhibited FR – GPI and fluid - phase uptake in BHK cells ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S2a ) , and the uptake of GEEC cargo , CTxB and fluid - phase in mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ; Fig . 1b ) 5 , 6 . In cells overexpressing ARF1 T31N , steady - state levels of surface FR – GPI were increased ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S2c ) , consistent with inhibition of GPI - AP endocytosis . ARF1 also plays a role in GPI - AP exocytosis , as surface delivery of GPI - APs ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S2b ) was also inhibited . In parallel , there was a reduction in surface levels of TfR ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S2d ) , and together with alteration in morphology of TfR containing perinuclear - recycling compartment ( Fig . 1a ) , these results suggest a role for ARF1 in the exocytosis of TfR and in TfR recycling 22 . ARF1 depletion inhibits uptake via the GEEC pathway ARF1 T31N overexpression could inhibit endocytosis via GEECs by seques - tering GDP exchange factors ( GEFs ) for other ARF family members , besides ARF1 , as some GEFs have overlapping specificity for ARF1 and ARF6 ( ref . 23 ) . To discount this possibility , ARF1 protein was depleted using RNA interference ( RNAi ) methodology 22 . Approximately 60 h post - transfection with ARF1 - specific short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) , cells appeared morphologically distinct ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S2e ) and ARF1 protein levels were reduced ( Fig . 2b ) .

Although surface - receptor normalized Tf - uptake was unaffected , FR – GPI and the fluid - phase uptake were markedly reduced ( Fig . 2a , c and d ) . Similar results were observed with another shRNA sequence against ARF1 ( data not shown ) . A reduction in fluid - phase uptake by ARF1 shRNA - treated cells was also confirmed by a biochemical assay , using horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) as a fluid - phase probe ( Fig . 2e ) . ARF1 depletion decreased both the number of fluid - containing endo - somes and average endosomal intensities ( see Supplementary informa - tion , Fig . S3a , b and c ) . Furthermore , reduction in FR – GPI uptake after treatment with ARF1 shRNA was not due to decreased cell - surface levels , as FR - GPI endocytosis was reduced in ARF1 depleted cells at compara - ble surface levels of FR – GPI ( Fig . 2d ) . Similarly to results obtained with ARF1 T31N expression , ARF1 depletion caused a reduction in cell - surface levels of TfR , consistent with previous studies on the role of ARF1 in mem - brane recycling to the plasma membrane 22 , 24 . In ARF1 - depleted cells , there was a detectable reduction in ARF3 levels ( Fig . 2b ) . As the ARF1 target sequences do not share any significant sequence similarity with ARF3 , this could be a result of coregulation of the protein products in CHO cells ; however , further experiments are required to confirm this possibil - ity .

In ARF3 - depleted cells , ARF3 levels were reduced without altering ARF1 levels ( Fig . 2b ) ; however , there was no reduction in fluid - phase , TfR or FR – GPI uptake ( Fig . 2a , c ) . Similarly in cells depleted of ARF4 or ARF5 , there was no detectable reduction in fluid uptake ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S4 ) . Moreover , expression of an RNAi - resistant form of ARF1 ( Fig . 3a ) that rescues the levels of ARF1 protein ( Fig . 3c , d ) restored fluid - phase uptake significantly ( Fig . 3b ) . In cells transfected with ARF1 shRNA , Golgi morphology was altered to a more hazy appearance . Consistent with rescue of ARF1 function , the morphology of the Golgi was also restored in cells expressing the RNAi - resistant construct when cotransfected with shRNA against ARF1 ( Fig . 3e ) . In contrast , depletion of ARF6 by shRNA did not affect endocytosis via the GEEC pathway ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S3d ) . These results provide evidence that ARF1 is specifically required for endocytosis via the GEEC pathway . Involvement of ARF1 in the GEEC pathway is distinct from its role in secretion Recently , perturbation of Syntaxin6 function was shown to inhibit caveo - lar uptake in human foreskin fibroblasts via inhibition of delivery of specific membrane components from the Golgi 25 . One explanation for the inhibition of endocytosis is an indirect effect by inhibition of mem - brane traffic from the Golgi to the plasma membrane , as perturbation of ARF1 inhibits Golgi - to - cell surface delivery of GPI - APs and other cargo 22 , 26 , 27 ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S2b ) . Many secretory mutants in yeast are also known to have endocytic defects 28 . To test this hypothesis , cells were treated with Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , a fungal metabolite that inhibits Golgi - to - cell surface traffic 29 by blocking some ARF - GEFs and causing release of Golgi - localized ARF 30 , 31 . At concentrations of BFA where Golgi disassembly occurs , cell - surface delivery of newly synthe - sized GPI - AP ( CFP – GPI ) was inhibited ( Fig . 4a ) . However , endocyto - sis of fluid phase and GPI - APs was measurably enhanced ( Fig . 4b ) via the GEEC pathway ; endosomes formed during BFA - treatment contain endocytosed FITC – Dex and FR – GPI , but not Tf ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S5a ) . A similar increase in uptake of a fluid - phase marker , HRP , on BFA treatment , has been reported in apical membrane of MDCK cells 32 . BFA treatment redistributed perinuclear - localized endocytosed Tf into extensive tubular compartments ( data not shown ) and reduced cell - surface levels of TfR , as previously reported 33 , but did not affect the internalization of Tf ( Fig . 1a and see Supplementary information , Fig . S5c ) . Importantly , BFA - mediated increase in uptake via the GEEC pathway was reversed by ARF1 T31N expression ( Fig . 4c ) .

These results also demonstrate that ARF1 function in the GEEC pathway is BFA - insensitive , implicating a BFA - resistant GEF in ARF1 activation at the plasma membrane . ARF1 modulates GEEC pathway via the adaptor ARHGAP10 ARF1 recruits ARHGAP10 , a multi - domain protein ( M r , 200K ) identified in yeast – two hybrid interaction screen of constitutively active ARF1 and ARF6 ( refs 34 , 35 ) . ARHGAP10 has a distinct domain ( ABD ) neces - sary for binding activated ARF1 , and a GAP domain for RhoGTPases ( R - G ; Fig . 5a ) . ABD encompasses a plekstrin homology ( PH ) domain , which does not bind to PtdIns , but is essential for ARF binding ; the R - G domain possesses a relatively high GAP activity for Cdc42 compared with other Rho GTPases , and mutation of Arg 1183 to alanine in the R - G domain renders it incapable of GAP activity 34 . When overexpressed , these domains function as dominant - negative inhibitors for the generation of actin - patches on the Golgi 34 . To determine whether ARHGAP10 could couple the activation of ARF1 with a GAP activity for Cdc42 , and in turn affect GPI - AP endocytosis , different domains of this protein were expressed ( Fig . 5b ) . All the truncated domains , with the exception of the mutated RhoGAP domain , were capable of marginal but significant inhibition of endocytosis via GEECs ( Fig . 5b ) , but not Tf uptake ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S5c ) . Overexpression of ARF1 Q71L , an isoform of ARF1 deficient in GTP hydrolysis , lead to increased FR – GPI internalization , as well as a more peripheral distribution of FR – GPI endosomes ( Fig . 5b , c ) , suggest - ing a role for ARF1 in post - endocytic trafficking . Persistent activa - tion of ARF1 was also accompanied by a reduction in Tf uptake ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S5c ) . This could arise due to seques - tration of shared GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) for ARF1 and ARF6 that are reported to be involved in clathrin - mediated endocyto - sis 17 . To determine whether ARHGAP10 exerts its effect downstream of activated ARF1 , we examined whether coexpression of ARHGAP10 20°C 20°C 37°C 37°C a Fluid – BFA + BFA FR b c N o r m a li z e d s u r f ace l e v e l s 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 20°C 37°C 37°C BFA : – + 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 Fluid FR * * * * * * N o r m a li z e d u p t a k e Control BFA BFA / ARF1 T31N Figure 4 Brefeldin A inhibits surface delivery of GPI - APs , but enhances endocytosis via the GEEC pathway .

Different domains of ARHGAP10 reversed the ARF1 Q71L - induced enhanced FR – GPI uptake to a similar extent ( Fig . 5c ) . The extent of inhibition of uptake was comparable in R - G - and R - G R1183A - domain expressing cells , suggesting that the interaction between ARHGAP10 and Cdc42 was not dependent on the activity of the GAP domain . Taken together with the inhibition observed in the ABD / R - G domain , these data suggest that full - length ARHGAP10 is required as a link between ARF1 and Cdc42 . The inhibition mediated by the ARHGAP10 domains may be explained by sequestration of activated ARF1 and thus inhibition of ARF1 , rather than a dominant - negative of ARHGAP10 . To determine a role for ARHGAP10 more specifically , endogenous ARHGAP10 was depleted using shRNA . As hamster ARHGAP10 sequence is unknown , the effects of shRNA were monitored in MEFs , where the uptake of fluid is ARF1 sensitive ( Fig . 1b ) and the ARHGAP10 sequence has been determined .

( d ) In a model for ARF1 - dependent regulation of endocytosis via GEEC pathway , ARF1 is activity is governed by a BFA - resistant GEF and a GAP of unknown identity ( ? ) . Activated ARF1 recruits ARHGAP10 to function as a RhoGAP for Cdc42 , resulting in inactivation and release of Cdc42 into cytosol . Activated Cdc42 regulates dynamic actin polymerization that leads to formation of endosomes via the GEEC pathway . However , persistent activation of Cdc42 ( due to constitutively activated Cdc42 or loss of ARHGAP10 - based RhoGAP activity ) leads to a different type of actin architecture ( see box ) , incompatible with endocytosis via the GEEC pathway .

In approximately 60 % of GFP - expressing cells , the shRNA resulted in alteration in Golgi morphology ; fewer cells showed a perturbation of actin organization ( approximately 30 % ) . Consistent with this result , expression of shRNA against ARHGAP10 resulted in approximately 60 % of the transfected cells exhibiting a detectable reduction in fluid uptake ( Fig . 5f , g ) . These results implicate ARHGAP10 in uptake via the GEEC pathway , downstream of ARF1 activation , potentially coupling it with GAP activity for Cdc42 . Recruitment of ABD to the plasma membrane is sensitive to ARF1 activation The involvement of ARF1 in endocytosis at the plasma membrane requires plasma membrane - localized activated ARF1 . To observe the distribution of ARF1 at the plasma membrane , total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) was used to report on distribution of fluorophores in the evanescent field in close proximity ( ~ 100 nm for 488nm illumination ) to the plasma membane . TIRFM imaging of live cells expressing low levels of ARF1 – GFP revealed relatively stable , punctate structures located at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 6a and see Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) that were resistant to treatment with BFA ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S5b ) . To determine whether the recruitment of the ABD at the plasma mem - brane depends on ARF1 activation , live cells expressing very low levels of GFP - tagged constructs of different ARHGAP10 domains were imaged using TIRFM ( Fig . 6a and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S6a ) . Low levels of expression provided better contrast of detection in TIRFM and did not affect fluid uptake , therefore acting as non - perturbing report - ers . Full - length ARHGAP10 was not detectably expressed in cells 34 , but similarly to ARF1 – GFP , GFP – ABD appeared as relatively stable , punc - tate structures at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 6a ) . Although GFP – ABD structures were fewer in number than ARF1 – GFP , they mimicked both the morphology and distribution of ARF1 puncta . Similar punctuate patterns were observed for ABD / R - G , which can bind to activated ARF1 and Cdc42 , but the R - G domain ( lacking ABD ) was uniformly distributed ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S6a ) . To determine whether ABD is a sensor of ARF1 activation , it was coexpressed with ARF1 shRNA or HA - tagged ARF1 T31N ( Fig . 6a ) . In both cases , GFP – ABD was not recruited to the plasma membrane and appeared similar to cytosolic GFP 9 . Furthermore , RFP – ABD punctae colocalized with ARF1 – GFP in the TIRFM field ( Fig . 6c , d ) , but not with ARF6 – GFP ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S6b – d ) . These observations provide evidence for endogenous ARF1 activation and localization at or near the plasma membrane , and support the use of ABD as a reporter for endogenous ARF1 activation . The recruitment of ABD to activated ARF1 sites in the plasma membrane is consistent with the coupling of activated ARF1 to ARHGAP10 in the plasma membrane . Activated ARF1 is located on early intermediates of the GEEC pathway If ARF1 activity is required for endocytosis via the GEEC pathway , colo - calization of activated ARF1 on nascent endocytic carriers of the GEEC pathway should be observed . For this purpose , cells were pulsed with TMR – Dex for short times ( 60 s ) and imaged . A fraction of fluid - contain - ing endosomes colocalized with GFP – ABD - labelled vesicles and tubules ( Fig . 6e ) and colocalization was also observed with ARF1 – GFP ( Fig . 6e ) . Newly formed fluid and FR – GPI containing endocytic carriers did not colocalize with coat components such as COPI ( known to interact with ARF1 on Golgi and some endosomal membranes 31 ) , even in the presence of ARF1 Q71L ( see Supplementary information , Fig . S5d ) . ARF1 influences Cdc42 dynamics on plasma membrane To address the role of ARF1 in regulating Cdc42 dynamics at the plasma membrane , the recruitment of Cdc42 to the plasma membraned was monitored using live - cell TIRFM , both in control cells and after silenc - ing endogenous ARF1 ( Fig . 7a ) . The extent of recruitment , and plasma membrane residence time , of single molecules of Cdc42 are positively influenced by GTP - bound status of Cdc42 ( ref . 9 ) . Depletion of ARF1 enhanced both the number of Cdc42 recruitment events and its resi - dence time ( Fig . 7a and see Supplementary Information , Movie 2 ) , and formation of cortical spike - like structures ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2e ) , consistent with activation of Cdc42 at the plasma membrane 9 , 36 , 37 . Furthermore , similarly to ARF1 silencing , overexpres - sion of a constitutively active form of Cdc42 ( Cdc42 L61 ) led to reduction in fluid - phase uptake ( Fig . 7b ) . To determine whether the coupling of ARF1 activation and Cdc42 dynamics can influence endocytosis via the GEEC pathway , GPI - AP endocytosis was monitored in cells overexpressing ARF1 Q71L . Coexpression of Cdc42 N17 ( a GTP - exchange deficient form 4 ) or treat - ment with Toxin B ( an inhibitor of Rho GTPases ) reverted the activated ARF1 Q71L - mediated increase in GEEC endocytosis ( Fig . 7c ) . These results provide evidence that ARF1 is part of the molecular machinery that regulates the GEEC pathway , upstream of Cdc42 . DIsCussIon ARF1 has been extensively studied in COPI - coated vesicle formation at the Golgi 38 , and it is also involved in recruiting AP3 and COPI subunits to endosomal membrane buds in PC12 cells 31 , 39 . A recent report using a het - erologously expressed sensor for activated ARFs detected BFA - insensitive sequential activation of ARF6 followed by ARF1 at sites of phagocytosis 40 . Our data , using a variety of techniques including RNAi depletion , domi - nant - negative inhibition and dominant - active activation , support a model ( Fig . 7d ) wherein activated ARF1 is directly and specifically involved in endocytosis via the Cdc42 - regulated GEEC pathway at the cell surface . There are several lines of evidence that support a role for ARHGAP10 as the downstream effector of activated ARF1 at the plasma membrane , providing the critical GAP - activity necessary for Cdc42 cycling : first , activated ARF1 directly binds to ARHGAP10 ( ref . 34 ) and silencing ARHGAP10 inhibits endocytosis via the GEEC pathway ; second , ARF1 - binding fragments of ARHGAP10 ( ABD ) block ARF1 Q71L - induced acti - vation of the GEEC pathway , as well as the constitutive operation of this pathway ; and third , ABD exhibits a dynamic punctate distribution at the plasma membrane colocalized with ARF1 , and maintained by acti - vated ARF1 , as depletion of ARF1 or overexpression of ARF1 T31N pre - vents recruitment of the ABD domain . Although ABD serves as a specific reporter for ARF1 on the plasma membrane , ABD is also capable of inter - acting with both ARF6 and ARF1 on intracellular structures — although much higher expression levels of ARF6 are required for visualizing the colocalization of ABD – RFP and ARF6 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S6 ) . This difference may arise due to differences in membrane com - position at plasma membrane and endomembranes , such that association with ARF1 is more favoured at some regions on the plasma membrane . 38  nature cell biology volume10 | number1 | JAnuArY2008 © 2008 Nature Publishing Group A RT I C L E S These regions could mark the sites where endocytosis via GEECs is initi - ated by enhancing the local cycling kinetics of Cdc42 . The coupling of ARF1 activation with a Cdc42 – GAP activity is sup - ported by the observation that depletion of ARF1 or ARF1 T31N expression ( data not shown ) results in persistently activated Cdc42 at the plasma membrane , as assessed by single - molecule TIRFM . As expression of both GTP - binding and GTPase - deficient mutants of Cdc42 inhibit endocytosis via GEECs , these results support a role for ARF1 - activa - tion in dynamic cycling of Cdc42 , required for endocytosis via GEECs . Activated Cdc42 is recruited to the plasma membrane and initiates actin polymerization , thereby promoting endocytosis via GEECs in an actin - dependent mechanism 9 . This is reminiscent of ARF1 – ARHGAP10 in actin - patch formation at the Golgi 34 . Likewise , it is possible that the ARF – ARHGAP10 interaction can also aid other endomembrane trans - port processes , the involvement of these molecular interactions in intra - cellular trafficking processes is not clear as yet . The involvement of ARF1 in endocytosis demands a source of acti - vated ARF1 and its effectors ( GAPs and GEFs ) at the plasma mem - brane . Our data show that the GEF involved in ARF1 activation is BFA insensitive . Similar observations have been reported in studies on the uptake of FM4 - 64 in maize root - hair cells 41 and phagocytosis in macro - phages 40 , where endocytosis is blocked on overexpression of ARF1 T31N , but not by BFA treatment . A recent report has shown that a BFA resistant ARF – GEF , GNL1 is required for selective internalization at the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root - hair cells 42 . The BFA - insensitive GEF could be a member of ARNO – Cytohesin family 43 . However , expres - sion of deletion mutants of ARNO failed to inhibit GPI - AP’s uptake ( S . K . , unpublished observations ) , suggesting the use of other GEF ( s ) . Another regulator of dynamin - independent endocytic pathways is the CtBP1 – BARS protein , which is reported to aid vesicle fission 11 . It is inter - esting that the ARF1 - specific GAP protein , ARFGAP1 , interacts directly with BARS , and is hypothesized to function as a dynamin counterpart 44 . ARFGAP1 may provide a link for interaction of ARF1 based machinery with CtBP1 – BARS . These studies suggest that endocytosis via the GEEC pathway could be limited by the availability of activated ARF1 at the plasma membrane in a wide variety of cell lines , including a human cell line ( S . K . , unpub - lished observations ) , and support a central role for ARF1 where it is necessary for endocytosis via GEECs , but do not exclude an ancillary role for ARF3 — ARFs have been reported to function in combination in specific trafficking processes 22 . Activated ARF1 ( detected by ABD - GFP staining ) is also found on nascent endocytic structures that contain the fluid phase and have the characteristic tubular morphology of CLICs and GEECs 5 . However , at this time , we cannot determine whether ARF1 is derived directly from the cell surface or independently recruited to CLICs – GEECs , post - inter - nalization . Thus , in addition to its role at the plasma membrane , ARF1 may have other roles in the GEEC pathway . Endocytic carriers stimulated by expression of ARF1 Q71L do not colocalize with COPI ( β - COP ) in fixed cells ; ARF1 may recruit other endosomal coats onto GEECs , such as AP3 on endosomes in PC12 cells 39 or other molecules 15 . Overexpression of ARF1 Q71L leads to peripheral distribution of FR endosomes , suggesting a role in post - endocytic trafficking as well . ARF6 is also thought to regulate a clathrin and dynamin - independent endocytic pathway 3 , 16 . As ARF6 depletion or inhibition 6 has no effect on uptake into GEECs , this argues that the ARF6 - and Cdc42 - regulated pathways are either distinct processes operating differentially in differ - ent cell types , or that ARF6 could modify the ARF1 – Cdc42 - regulated pathway , post - internalization in some cell types . In conclusion , we find that multiple proteins , which have a Golgi - enriched steady - state distribution , are involved in regulating endocytosis via the dynamin - independent pinocytic ( GEEC ) pathway . In addition to ARF1 , CtBP1 – BARS and Cdc42 are both enriched in the Golgi 11 , 45 . The involvement of yet another central secretory traffic regulator , ARF1 in endocytosis , raises an interesting possibility that exocytosis and endocy - tosis may be integrated for maintenance of plasma membrane homeos - tasis 2 . In addition , our data suggest that this is likely to be accomplished by regulated spatial distribution of distinct ARF1 effectors , and will be a focus of future studies .

RNAi - resistant ARF1 was generated by using a primer 5´ - ATAGGCTTCAACG TGGAAAC G GT A GAGTACAAGAACATCAGCTTC - 3´ , where the nucleotide sequences corresponding to the ARF1 RNAi sequence used were altered as indi - cated in bold type . This primer was used to amplify human ARF1 – GFP using PCR . The resultant plasmid was sequenced verified before use . ARF6 shRNA ( sequence corresponding to 307 – 327 nucleotides of human ARF6 coding sequence ; 5´ - CCAGGAGCTGCACCGCATTAT - 3´ ) , was chosen as target sequence . This sequence is conserved in human , mouse and rat ARF6 . The shRNA against this sequence was ligated into pGSUPER vector , as previously described 46 . A similar procedure was used for generation of ARHGAP10 shRNA . The sequence cho - sen was conserved between human and mouse ARHGAP10 and corresponds to 817 – 836 in human coding sequence ( 5´ - GTCATTGTGCCTTCTGAGA - 3´ ) . For generation of mRFP – ABD , mRFP was obtained from plasmid mRFPpSETb using the primer 5´ - ATAGGTACCACCGGTCGCCACCATGGCCTCCTCCGAG - 3´ . Following the RFP sequence , a 14 bp linker sequence was added such that mRFP sequence is flanked by Age I and Bgl II enzyme sites . EGFP from pEGFPC2 – ABD was replaced with mRFP , using these enzyme sites . All of the above mentioned constructs were used after confirmation of sequence following cloning . Endocytic and exocytic assays and immunofluorescence microscopy . Endocytic and exocytic assays cells were carried out as previously described 4 with minor modifications , as detailed in the Supplementary Information , Methods . shRNA transfection and western blotting . shRNA in the pSUPER vector ( ARF1 ) was transfected with a fixed ratio of vector carrying the shRNA sequence of interest or pSUPER vector alone ( mock ) with pEGFP - N1 ( 3 : 1 , w / w ) in 3 cm cover - slip dishes , to ensure cotransfection . Coexpression using this protocol was confirmed by measuring the reduction of protein target levels in GFP - expressing cells by using specific antibodies against the protein target . In all of the endo - cytic experiments , shRNA was cotransfected with pEGFP - N1 for identification of transfected cells , unless otherwise mentioned . Cells transfected with shRNA directed against ARF6 in pG - SUPER vectors were identified by GFP coexpres - sion . To biochemically measure protein depletion , cells were plated in 92 mm dishes and cotransfected with shRNA carrying vector or vector alone ( control ) with pEGFP - N1 . Post - transfection , cells were allowed to grow for 60 h , harvested using trypsin – EDTA , and GFP - positive cells were sorted using FACS - Vantage SE ( BD , San Jose , CA ) . Approximately 30 , 000 sorted cells from each transfection were lysed and loaded on a 12 % SDS – PAGE . Protein estimation was carried out after transfer of proteins on PVDF membranes and the regions corresponding to bands of interest on the membrane were cut and probed using anti - ARF1 , anti - ARF6 , anti - ARF3 or anti - actin antibodies . The band intensities were sub - sequently quantified . Imaging , image processing and quantification . Confocal microscopy was carried out on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta imaging system ( 63× 1 . 4 NA ; Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) or Andor Spinning Disc confocal imaging system ( 60× 1 . 42 NA or 100× 1 . 4 NA , with nature cell biology volume10 | number1 | JAnuArY2008 39 © 2008 Nature Publishing Group A RT I C L E S Ixon EMCCD ; Andor Technologies , Belfast , Ireland ) using appropriate factory - set filters and dichroics for different fluorophores . Care was taken to avoid fluorophore saturation during acquisition . For quantitative imaging on spinning disc confocal microscope , laser powers and camera gains were maintained constant throughout the experiment . Images acquired using LSM ( Zeiss ) software or Revolution ( Andor ) software was converted into TIFF and analysed using Metamorph software . For live imaging , Nikon TE 2000 inverted system equipped with 100× oil objective ( NA 1 . 45 ) and a cooled CCD cascade camera ( Photometrics Inc , Tuscon , AZ ) was used . For dual - colour live imaging , cell growth medium was changed to M1 with 0 . 1 % BSA and glucose , and the dishes containing cells were brought to tempera - ture - controlled stage maintained at 37 °C . Images were collected using Metamorph acquisition software . For quantification of uptake of endocytic tracers , images were obtained using 20× , 0 . 75 NA objective on widefield microscope ( Nikon TE300 ) . The cells from different fields from each dish were defined as regions , and the integrated intensi - ties inside the ‘regions’ were obtained using the ‘region measurement’ application of Metamorph . Average and s . d . of integrated intensities per cell from each dish was determined and plotted as weighted mean of these values , as described in statistical analysis section , unless otherwise stated . The number and intensity of endosomes formed in cells pulsed with TMR – Dex ( 1 mg ml – 1 ) for 3 min at 37 °C were determined by imaging cells at 20 °C . Images were processed and the endo - somes were identified , and total number of endosomes and associated intensity were calculated , as previously described 4 , 6 . Briefly , the images were processed for background correction using Metamorph and threshold using Multispot software , such that all the endosomes with intensity above the background were identified . The number of endosomes , area and integrated intensity per endosome were determined per cell using Multispot . TIRF imaging was carried out exactly as previously described 9 . Cdc42 spots were defined as pixels with intensity values above autofluorescence and cor - respond to single molecules of Cdc42 – GFP according to criterion previously established criterion 9 . Note , bleaching of single GFP fluorophores occurs over a much longer period than measured for the Cdc42 – GFP fluorophores . Only spots that make an appearance within the imaging duration ( 100 ms per frame , 200 frames stream acquisition ) were considered for quantification . The residence time of each spot was manually estimated by determining the number of frames it was visible . The data were binned and expressed as percentage of total number of dynamic spots tracked . In all cases , images were analysed using Metamorph software and processed for presentation using Adobe Photoshop . Images are displayed at the same contrast - settings for control and treated cells in all display items . The scale bar corresponds to 10 µm , unless otherwise specified . Statistical analysis . The values plotted are weighted mean , µ x , obtained from at least two different dishes in each experiment , calculated using the following formula Equation 1 ∑ n i ∑ n i σ 2 X i X X i σ 2 i × = x µ where i is the number of cover - slip dishes used in an experiment , X i is the mean of fluorescence intensities determined for cells in a single dish , n i the number of cells observed per dish , and σ Xi the s . d . in the measurement . The s . e . m . was determined by the following equation , s . e . m = ( ) ∑ n i X σ 2 i 1 / 2 Equation 2 unless otherwise specified . Minimum number of cells ( n ) quantified from an individual dish is indicated in the figure legends . Statistical significance was meas - ured using unpaired , two - tail distribution , Student’s it - test . Unless specifically mentioned , the P values were < 0 . 001 in all cases reported . Each experiment was repeated three or more times with similar results , unless otherwise stated . Note : Supplementary Information is available on the Nature Cell Biology website .

The pulse was terminated by cooling cells on ice and washing with chilled HEPES - buffered isotonic buffer ( M1 : 140mM NaCl , 20mM HEPES , 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 5mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) . To remove surface fluorescence , cells were treated with PI - PLC ( 50 μ g / ml , 1h ; GPI - APs ) or with ascorbate buffer ( 160mM sodium ascorbate , 40mM ascorbic acid , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM CaCl 2 , pH 4 . 5 ; Tf ) at 4 ° C and subsequently fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde for 15min . Similarly , for fluid - phase and CTx uptake , cells were incubated with 1mg / ml fluorescently - labeled dextran or 1 μ g / ml CTx at 37 ° C . C 6 - LacCer endocytosis was monitored by surface labeling cells with C 6 - LacCer . C 6 - LacCer was ( 2 . 6mM in ethanol ) dissolved in 0 . 15 % defatted BSA to achieve a concentration of 100 μ M . The BSA - lipid complexes was dialyzed against PBS at 37ºC for 20min to remove ethanol and used for endocytosis assays . IA2 . 2 cells pre - incubated in serum - free medium for 1h , and prior to incubation with 200nM BSA - lipid complexes on ice for 20min . Subsequent to washing , cells were chased at 37 ° C for 5min in presence of Alexa 647 - Dex ( 2mg / ml ) . The pulse was terminated by washing with chilled M1 on ice and surface C 6 - LacCer was back - extracted by incubation of cells with 5 % solution of defatted BSA in M1 at 4 ° C for 30min . Cells were subsequently fixed and imaged . In some experiments , cells were processed for immunostaining post - fixation . For HRP uptake , cells were plated in 92mm dishes , transfected with vector alone or ARF1 shRNA for 72h . Cells were pulsed with 1mg / ml HRP for 10min at 37ºC , then washed with chilled M1 and ascorbate buffer and © 200 8 Nature Publishing Group subsequently incubated with 5mg / ml BSA on ice . Cells were then scraped off the dish , counted and lysed using RIPA buffer ( 150mM NaCl , 50mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 500 (cid:1) M EDTA , 100 (cid:1) M EGTA , 1 . 0 % Triton X - 100 , and 1 % sodium deoxycholate ) . Cell lysates from equal numbers of cells were used for total protein estimation and HRP activity . HRP activity was measured by monitoring the absorbance of reaction product , upon the incubating with equal amounts of H 2 O 2 / TMB solution , at 450nm on ELISA reader ( BioRad ) . To quantify CFP - GPI exocytosis , cells were plated in HEPES - buffered HF - 12 , transfected with CFP - GPI DNA and post - transfection ( 10h ) , transferred to restrictive temperature of 20 ° C . After 12h at 20 ° C , cells were incubated with 50 μ g / ml cycloheximide for an additional hour , followed with 1h at 37 ° C along with cycloheximide , with or without BFA , washed with pre - chilled M1 , incubated with fluorescently labeled anti - GFP monoclonal antibody , and fixed prior to imaging . In the immunofluorescence assays , cells were fixed and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Tween20 for 20min and then incubated with primary and fluorescently labeled secondary antibody where necessary . Under these conditions , minimal loss of fluid - phase endocytic tracers was detected . References : 1 . Sharma , P . et al .
