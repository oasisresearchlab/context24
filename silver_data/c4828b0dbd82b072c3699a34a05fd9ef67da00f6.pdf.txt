Here , we describe a role for ubiquitination in this process . We ﬁnd that the E3 RING ubiquitin ligase , MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 , localizes to endosomes through interactions with the retromer complex . Knockdown of MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 or the Ube2O E2 ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme signiﬁ - cantly impaired retromer - mediated transport . We further demonstrate that MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 ubiquitin ligase activity is required for nucleation of endosomal F - actin by the WASH regulatory complex , a known regulator of retromer - mediated transport . Mecha - nistic studies showed that MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 facili - tates K63 - linked ubiquitination of WASH K220 . Signiﬁcantly , disruption of WASH ubiquitination impaired endosomal F - actin nucleation and retro - mer - dependent transport . These ﬁndings provide a cellular and molecular function for MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 in retrograde transport , including an unap - preciated role of K63 - linked ubiquitination and identiﬁcation of an activating signal of the WASH regulatory complex . INTRODUCTION Endosomal protein recycling pathways facilitate the transfer of membrane proteins from early and late endosomes back to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) or plasma membrane ( Bonifacino and Rojas , 2006 ) . In doing so , these pathways generally function to prevent lysosomal delivery and degradation of membrane proteins . Endosome - to - Golgi transport , referred to as retro - grade transport , is an important cellular process that facilitates the recycling of a variety of proteins , including sorting receptors ( such as CI - M6PR ) , SNARE membrane fusion proteins , mem - brane receptors , metabolite transporters , and several proteins that undergo polarized localization / secretion ( Bonifacino and Rojas , 2006 ; Johannes and Popoff , 2008 ) . Importantly , retro - grade transport has been implicated in a number of different human pathologies . Endosome - to - Golgi transport is essential for cellular entry of pathogenic toxins , such as Shiga , cholera , and ricin , as well as viral pathogens such as HIV ( Brass et al . , 2008 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 2005 ) . Furthermore , components of the retrograde transport pathway are downregulated in Alz - heimer’s disease and upregulated in cancer ( Scott et al . , 2009 ; Small , 2008 ) . Recent studies have started to deﬁne the molecular machinery crucial for different aspects of this process , including cargo recognition , endosomal membrane budding , tubulation and scission , and vesicle transport , tethering , and fusion at the TGN ( Bonifacino and Rojas , 2006 ; Cullen and Korswagen , 2012 ) . One critical component is the retromer protein complex that consists of VPS26 , VPS29 , and VPS35 and functions to recognize retrograde cargo on endosomes ( Bonifacino and Hur - ley , 2008 ) . Another essential factor in retrograde transport is WASH . WASH is a member of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family consisting of WASP / N - WASP , WAVE , WHAMM , JMY , and WASH ( Campellone and Welch , 2010 ) . Like other WASP family members , WASH contains a carboxy - terminal VCA ( verprolin homologous or WH2 , central hydro - phobic , and acidic ) motif that binds to actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex to stimulate actin ﬁlament nucleation ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Duleh and Welch , 2010 ; Jia et al . , 2010 ; Linardopoulou et al . , 2007 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Recent studies have demonstrated that WASH is endosomal - associated , exists in amacromolecular complex termed the WA SH r egulatory c omplex ( SHRC ) and functions downstream of the retromer complex to facilitate endosome - to - Golgi transport ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Duleh and Welch , 2010 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Linardopoulou et al . , Cell 152 , 1051 – 1064 , February 28 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 1051 2007 ) . Importantly , retromer and SHRC have been implicated in other endosomal recycling pathways , including endosome - to - plasma membrane sorting of integrins ( Zech et al . , 2011 ) . SHRC consists of at least ﬁve core factors , CCDC53 , FAM21 , SWIP , Strumpellin , and WASH ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Jia et al . , 2010 ) . The SHRC is recruited to early endosomes by multivalent interactions between repeat elements in FAM21 and the retromer subunit VPS35 ( Harbour et al . , 2012 ; Jia et al . , 2012 ) . WASH is essential for Arp2 / 3 - induced F - actin accumulation on endosomes ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez et al . , 2012 ) . With WASH suppression , scission of membrane tubules emanating from endosomes was sug - gested to be impaired ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billa - deau , 2009 ) and knockout of WASH in MEFs resulted in the collapse of the early endosomal and lysosomal networks ( Gomez et al . , 2012 ) . Nucleation of F - actin by WASP family members is regulated by a variety of signaling events that converge on VCA motif activa - tion / exposure ( Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) . The VCA motifs of WASP / N - WASP , WAVE , and WASH are autoinhibited through in - tramolecular and intermolecular interactions ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ; Jia et al . , 2010 ; Kim et al . , 2000 ; Miki et al . , 1998 ) . Several signaling molecules have been identiﬁed to promote the activation / exposure of WASP / N - WASP and WAVE VCA motifs to allow timed and localized F - actin nucleation , including small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 , PIP 2 and PIP 3 phos - pholipids , and phosphorylation by the Src , Abl , and Cdk family of kinases ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2000 ; Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ; Miki et al . , 1998 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) . Contrary to WASP / N - WASP and WAVE , the mechanisms regulating WASH activation have been more elusive . The Rho GTPase has been genetically linked to activa - tion of WASH in Drosophila ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) but is not sufﬁcient to directly activate human WASH in vitro ( Jia et al . , 2010 ) . Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modiﬁcation in which a small 76 amino acid protein is covalently attached to lysine resi - dues in substrate proteins through a three step E1 , E2 , and E3 enzymatic cascade ( Fang and Weissman , 2004 ) . Ubiquitination can have pleiotropic effects on its substrates depending on the length and type of ubiquitin chains . K48 - linked ubiquitin chains typically target proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome ( Bochtler et al . , 1999 ) . However , K63 - linked ubiquitination typi - cally acts as a signaling event to modify function , such as altering protein - protein interactions , protein conformations , or targeting proteins for lysosomal delivery ( Sun and Chen , 2004 ) . Recently , we identiﬁed a class of proteins that bind to and enhance the activity of E3 RING ubiquitin ligases ( Doyle et al . , 2010 ) . These ubiquitin ligase enhancers are known as melanoma antigen ( MAGE ) genes and comprise a family of over 50 unique human genes ( Chomez et al . , 2001 ) . Although the biochemical function of MAGE proteins in ubiquitination has been elucidated , the cellular processes in which speciﬁc MAGE proteins act are unclear . Here , we investigate the cellular function of MAGE - L2 , a paternally imprinted gene that is abundantly expressed in the brain , maps to the Prader - Willi syndrome deletion locus , and is implicated in normal circadian rhythm and the hypothalamic - endocrine axis ( Bischof et al . , 2007 ; Boccaccio et al . , 1999 ; Ko - zlov et al . , 2007 ; Tennese and Wevrick , 2011 ) . RESULTS Identiﬁcation of MAGE - L2 E3 RING Ubiquitin Ligase Partner and Subcellular Localization To determine the speciﬁc E3 RING ubiquitin ligase partner of MAGE - L2 and gain insight into its cellular function , we exam - ined MAGE - L2 binding partners by tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ( TAP ) coupled to mass spectrometry . The E3 RING ubiquitin ligase TRIM27 was identiﬁed as a major binding partner of MAGE - L2 ( Figure 1A ) . Binding of MAGE - L2 and TRIM27 was conﬁrmed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments ( Figures 1B and S1C available online ) . Moreover , in vitro trans - lated MAGE - L2 bound recombinant GST - TRIM27 but not GST alone , indicating the interaction between the two proteins is direct ( Figure 1C ) . To conﬁrm the association of MAGE - L2 and TRIM27 , we stably expressed GFP - MAGE - L2 and mCherry - TRIM27 in U2OS cells and examined their colocalization by live - cell microscopy . We found that the two proteins colocalized in discrete cytoplasmic puncta ( Figure 1D ) , as well as in a smaller nuclear pool ( data not shown ) . These ﬁndings suggest that TRIM27 binds MAGE - L2 and that the MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 ubiquitin ligase complex localizes to discrete cytoplasmic structures . MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 Binds and Localizes to Retromer - Containing Endosomes To determine the identity of the MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 structures , we reanalyzed our mass spectrometry data of MAGE - L2 inter - acting proteins for clues . Interestingly , MAGE - L2 was identiﬁed to interact with VPS35 and VPS26 ( Figure 1A ) , two components of the endosomal retromer complex . mCherry - TRIM27 colocal - ized with GFP - tagged VPS35 , VPS29 , and VPS26 , as well as the retromer - associated SHRC proteins , WASH and FAM21 ( Figure S1A ) . Furthermore , costaining for endogenous VPS35 and TRIM27 clearly identiﬁed TRIM27 cytoplasmic structures as retromer - positive endosomes ( Figure 1E ) . Unfortunately , we were unable to observe endogenous MAGE - L2 due to the lack of speciﬁc , high - quality antibodies ( data not shown ) . More detailed analysis of TRIM27 localization revealed its localization to numerous tubular structures emanating from endosomes ( Fig - ure 1F ) , a property shared with the retromer complex ( Arighi et al . , 2004 ; Bonifacino and Hurley , 2008 ) . These ﬁndings sug - gest that MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 localizes to the retromer - positive subset of endosomes . Next , we conﬁrmed the interaction between MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 and the retromer complex initially observed by mass spectrometry . MAGE - L2 and TRIM27 coimmunoprecipitated with all three components of the retromer complex ( Figures S1B and S1C and data not shown ) and MAGE - L2 directly bound recombinant GST - VPS35 in vitro through its WH - B motif ( Figures S1D , S1G , and S1H ) . In addition , MAGE - L2 interaction with VPS35 did not impair VPS35 binding to the SHRC component FAM21 ( Figure S1I ) . Furthermore , MAGE - L2 - VPS35 interaction is functionally important because knockdown of VPS35 dramat - ically inhibited MAGE - L2 and TRIM27 endosomal localization ( Figures S1E and S1F and data not shown ) . These ﬁndings sug - gest that VPS35 recruits MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 to retromer - positive endosomes by binding to MAGE - L2 . 1052 Cell 152 , 1051 – 1064 , February 28 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 Is Required for Endosomal Protein Recycling We next assessed whether MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 participates in endosome - to - Golgi transport . Two independent siRNAs tar - geting MAGE - L2 or TRIM27 were identiﬁed that signiﬁcantly reduced their target protein’s levels but had no effects on the levels of other known essential factors required for retrograde transport ( Figures S2A – S2C ) . Multiple siRNAs targeting MAGE - L2 or TRIM27 resulted in impaired CI - M6PR and TGN46 traf - ﬁcking to a degree similar to VPS35 - RNAi ( Figures 2A – 2C and S2D ) . Importantly , the overall organization of the TGN was unaf - fected in MAGE - L2 - or TRIM27 - RNAi cells ( Figure S2E ) . The steady - state defects in CI - M6PR localization were corroborated by examining transport of a small pool of surface localized CI - M6PR to the TGN in MAGE - L2 - and TRIM27 - RNAi cells . MAGE - L2 - or TRIM27 - RNAi impaired transport of surface - labeled CI - M6PR to the TGN ( Figure 2D ) . Importantly , the dis - persed steady - state or surface - labeled CI - M6PR in TRIM27 - or MAGE - L2 - RNAi cells colocalized with the endosomal marker EEA1 ( Figures 2E and S2F ) . Furthermore , CI - M6PR protein levels were reduced in MAGE - L2 - and TRIM27 - RNAi cells and Cathepsin D processing and trafﬁcking were impaired ( Fig - ure 2F ) . Finally , overexpression of MAGE - L2 in combination with TRIM27 increased CI - M6PR endosomal retrieval kinetics ( Figure S2G ) . These results suggest that MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 is required for endosome - to - Golgi retrograde transport . To extend our ﬁndings , we examined the requirement of TRIM27 on the trafﬁcking of two additional physiologically and pathologically relevant substrates of the retromer and SHRC complexes . First , knockdown of TRIM27 signiﬁcantly impaired trafﬁcking of the retromer cargo cholera toxin subunit B ( CTxB ) to the TGN ( Figure 2G ) . However , the trafﬁcking of the SHRC - independent cargo Transferrin receptor to perinuclear recycling endosomes was unaltered in TRIM27 - RNAi cells ( Figure 2G ) ( Du - leh and Welch , 2010 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Gomez et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , the retromer and SHRC complexes have been implicated in the recycling of endosomal proteins to the plasma membrane , including integrins ( Duleh and Welch , 2012 ; Zech – VPS26 – VPS35 – MAGE - L2 – TRIM27 kDa 250 – 150 – 100 – 75 – 50 – 37 – 25 – 20 – T AP - V e c t o r T AP - M A G E - L2 A M yc - M A G E - L2 M yc - V e c t o r – Myc - MAGE - L2 EndogenousTRIM27 W C L B I P : A n t i - M yc 20 % I npu t G S T G S T - T R I M 27 – Myc - MAGE - L2 C D m C h - T R I M 27 G F P - M A G E - L2 O v e r l a y + DN A TRIM27 VPS35 Overlay + DNA F mCh - TRIM27 E 75 – 50 – 75 – 50 – yz xz Rr = 0 . 7 Rr = 0 . 8 * * – EndogenousTRIM27 – Figure 1 .

Therefore , we examined whether MAGE - L2 and TRIM27 function extends beyond endosome - to - Golgi trafﬁcking by examining their contribution to the recycling of integrin a 5 to the plasma membrane . Knockdown of MAGE - L2 or TRIM27 signiﬁcantly decreased cell surface integrin a 5 ( Figure 2H ) and increased the intracellular pool of integrin a 5 in EEA1 - negative endosomes ( Figure 2I ) . Importantly , this decrease in cell surface integrin a 5 in MAGE - L2 - or TRIM27 - RNAi cells is functionally signiﬁcant because invasion of cells through matrigel , a process regulated by integrins , is signiﬁcantly impaired in MAGE - L2 - or TRIM27 - RNAi cells ( Figure 2J ) . These results suggest that MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 functions with the retromer and SHRC com - plexes in both endosome - to - Golgi and endosome - to - plasma membrane protein recycling . Ube2O E2 Ubiquitin - Conjugating Enzyme Is Required for Retrograde Transport Next , we determined whether the requirement for MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 in retrograde transport involved its ubiquitin ligase activity by utilizing a TRIM27 RING mutant lacking E3 ubiquitin ligase activity . Unlike wild - type TRIM27 , expression of an RNAi resistant TRIM27 RING mutant was unable to rescue retrograde transport of CI - M6PR in TRIM27 - RNAi cells ( Figures 3A and S3A ) . Importantly , the TRIM27 RING mutant localized similarly to the wild - type protein ( Figure S3B ) . These results suggest that the ubiquitin ligase activity of MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 is impor - tant for proper retrograde transport . Next , we examined which of the more than 35 different E2 ubiquitin - conjugating enzymes functions with MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 to facilitate retrograde endosome - to - Golgi trafﬁcking of CI - M6PR . Of the 35 E2 enzymes examined , knockdown of only Ube2O and Ube2L6 resulted in dramatic alteration of CI - M6PR localization ( Figures 3B and S3C , and data not shown ) . Ube2O - RNAi showed similar penetrance as TRIM27 - RNAi ( Fig - ures 3B and 3C ) , resulted in CI - M6PR dispersion to EEA1 - positive endosomes ( Figure 3D ) , and reduced total CI - M6PR ( Figure 3E ) . However , Ube2L6 - RNAi did not redistribute CI - M6PR to EEA - positive endosomes ( Figure 3D ) or promote lyso - somal degradation of CI - M6PR ( Figure 3E ) but rather disrupted TGN organization ( Figure S3D ) . Notably , Ube2O , but not Ube2L6 , was also identiﬁed in a yeast - 2 - hybrid screen for E2 enzymes interacting with TRIM27 ( Markson et al . , 2009 ) . These results suggest that the Ube2O E2 ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme is the physiologically relevant E2 enzyme functioning with MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 in supporting retrograde transport . Retrograde Transport Requires K63 - Linked Ubiquitin Chains We next investigated whether retrograde transport was depen - dent on ubiquitin , and if so , which type of polyubiquitin chain . To do so , we utilized the previously developed system ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) to inducibly knockdown ubiquitin by addition of tetracycline and replace it with a ubiquitin variant that is unable to produce a speciﬁc ubiquitin chain , namely ubiquitin in which lysine 48 or lysine 63 has been mutated to arginine ( K48R or K63R , respectively ; Figures S3E and S3F ) . We found that deple - tion of ubiquitin from cells dramatically affected CI - M6PR trafﬁcking ( Figures 3F and S3G ) . Addition of wild - type or K48R ubiquitin completely rescued CI - M6PR localization ( Figures 3F and S3G ) , suggesting that ubiquitin is required for retrograde trafﬁcking , but K48 - linked ubiquitin chains are not . In contrast , depletion of K63 - ubiquitin chains dramatically blocked CI - M6PR TGN localization and relocalized it to EEA1 - positive endo - somes ( Figures 3F and S3G and data not shown ) but had no signiﬁcant effect on the overall organization of the TGN ( Fig - ure S3H ) . Similarly to the steady - state behavior , retrograde transport of cell surface - labeled CI - M6PR to the TGN is also dependent on K63 - linked ubiquitination ( Figures 3G and S3I ) . Furthermore , depletion of K63 - linked ubiquitin chains altered trafﬁcking of the lysosomal hydrolase Cathepsin D , resulting in the reduction of mature Cathepsin D , accumulation of pro - and intermediate - Cathepsin D , and the secretion of pro - Cathepsin D into the cell culture media ( Figure 3H ) . These results suggest that K63 - linked ubiquitination is important for proper retrograde transport . MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 , Ube2O , and K63 - Linked Ubiquitin Chains Are Required for Efﬁcient Endosomal F - Actin Assembly Next , we assessed the precise mechanism by which MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 , Ube2O , and K63 - linked ubiquitination promotes retro - grade transport . Retrograde transport requires several ordered steps to facilitate endosome - to - Golgi transport , including endo - somal localization of the retromer complex and localization and activation of the SHRC to facilitate endosomal F - actin accumu - lation by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Cullen and Korswagen , 2012 ) . We interrogated several of these speciﬁc steps to determine when ubiquitination may be important . The localization of the retromer complex to CI - M6PR substrate - containing endosomes was un - affected by depletion of TRIM27 or K63 - linked ubiquitin chains ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . In addition , the SHRC was still recruited normally to retromer - positive endosomes in TRIM27 - RNAi cells ( Figure S4C ) . However , knockdown of MAGE - L2 or TRIM27 re - sulted in reduced endosomal F - actin to a degree similar to WASH - RNAi ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Similarly , knockdown of the physiologically relevant Ube2O E2 enzyme , but not Ube2L6 , re - sulted in a reduced endosomal F - actin ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Consistent with reduced endosomal F - actin , knockdown of MAGE - L2 , TRIM27 , or Ube2O , but not Ube2L6 , signiﬁcantly reduced the accumulation of the Arp2 / 3 complex subunit , ARPC5 , on SHRC - positive endosomes ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . Notably , there was no defect in total ARPC5 or F - actin levels ( Figure 4D and data not shown ) . Likewise , depletion of K63 - linked ubiquitin chains resulted in the speciﬁc reduction of ( H ) Cells were treated with the indicated siRNAs for 72 hr and surface integrin a 5 was determined by ﬂow cytometry .

Consistent with the previously described role of SHRC and endosomal F - actin in membrane tubule scission ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) , TRIM27 - RNAi , shUb - Ub , and shUb - Ub ( K63R ) cells accumulated endosomal tubules ( Figures S4D and S4E ) . These results sug - gest that K63 - linked ubiquitination by MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 and Ube2O is required for localization of the Arp2 / 3 complex to the SHRC and generation of endosomal F - actin . Uninhibited Endosomal Actin Assembly Rescues Endosome - to - Golgi Transport Defects of TRIM27 - RNAi and K63 - Ubiquitin Depleted Cells We next examined whether the defective endosome - to - Golgi retrograde trafﬁcking in TRIM27 - RNAi or shUb - Ub ( K63R ) cells is due to decreased endosomal F - actin . First , we designed a fusion protein in which endosomal F - actin accumulation could be induced by an uninhibited WASH VCA motif . WASH VCA motif was fused to the C - terminal domain of FAM21 ( D 356N ) , which binds VPS35 for endosomal targeting ( Figure 5A ) ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ; Jia et al . , 2012 ) . Upon expression in cells , this fusion protein localized to retromer - positive endosomes ( Figure 5A ) and increased F - actin accumulation on endo - somes ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . We next determined whether this FAM21 - WASH - VCA fusion could rescue retrograde transport in TRIM27 - RNAi cells . Indeed , this was the case for both Cathepsin D trafﬁcking ( Figure 5C ) and CI - M6PR TGN localiza - tion ( Figures 5D and S4F ) . Furthermore , the FAM21 - WASH - VCA fusion rescued CI - M6PR trafﬁcking in cells deﬁcient for K63 - linked ubiquitin chains ( Figures 5E and S4G ) . Therefore , the primary requirement for TRIM27 and K63 - linked ubiquitin chains in retrograde trafﬁcking appears to be for accumulation of endosomal F - actin . MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 Ubiquitinates WASH K220 to Promote Endosomal F - Actin Assembly Generation of endosomal F - actin is facilitated by the SHRC , which binds the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin through a conserved VCA domain in WASH ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Gomez and Billa - deau , 2009 ) . However , the WASH VCA domain exists in an autoinhibited state that must be relieved before nucleation of F - actin by the Arp2 / 3 complex can be achieved ( Jia et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , we speculated that MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 may facilitate WASH - VCA exposure , Arp2 / 3 complex and actin bind - ing , and consequent F - actin nucleation on endosomes through targeted ubiquitination of the SHRC . Based on the highly homol - ogous WAVE regulatory complex , regulators of SHRC activation are predicted to act on WASH itself or SWIP ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Jia et al . , 2010 ) . Although we were unable to detect any ubiquiti - nation of endogenous SWIP ( Figure S5A ) , endogenous WASH was highly ubiquitinated ( Figure 6A ) . WASH ubiquitination was TRIM27 - dependent , as knockdown of TRIM27 dramatically reduced endogenous WASH ubiquitination ( Figure 6B ) . Further - more , WASH ubiquitination was K63 linked , as WASH was unable to be polyubiquitinated by K63R ubiquitin ( Figure 6C ) . These ﬁndings suggest that TRIM27 is required for K63 - linked ubiquitination of WASH . Next we investigated the importance of WASH ubiquitination . To do so , we ﬁrst determined the speciﬁc lysine in WASH that is conjugated to K63 - linked ubiquitin chains . A single lysine , K220 , in WASH had been identiﬁed in global proteomics studies to be ubiquitinated ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Signiﬁcantly , K220 is a highly conserved residue in species that express TRIM27 orthologs ( Figure S5D ) . This residue is located in a region of WASH that is analogous to the ‘‘meander’’ region of WAVE , which is known to make contacts necessary for intracomplex inhibition in the WAVE regulatory complex ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , we examined whether WASH ubiquitination was dependent on K220 . Endogenous WASH was knocked down by RNAi and YFP - tagged wild - type or K220R WASH was re - expressed to insure integration of the re - expressed WASH into the SHRC . Unlike YFP - WASH wild - type , YFP - WASH K220R failed to be ubiquitinated ( Figure 6C ) , suggesting that WASH ubiquitination is dependent on K220 . We next examined whether WASH ubiquitination is important for retrograde transport . Using our re - expression system , YFP - WASH K220R , unlike wild - type YFP - WASH , could not support proper retrograde transport resulting in CI - M6PR dispersion ( Figures 6D and S5B ) and degradation ( Figures 6E and S5B ) and Cathepsin D secretion ( Figure 6F ) . These results suggest that K63 - linked ubiquitination of WASH K220 by TRIM27 is required for WASH function in retro - grade transport . We next examined whether WASH K220 ubiquitination may act as a signal to relieve WASH autoinhibition and promote its activity toward the Arp2 / 3 complex . As previously reported ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) , knockdown of WASH resulted in reduced endosomal Arp2 / 3 complex localization ( Figures 6G and S5C ) . Unlike wild - type YFP - WASH , re - expression of YFP - WASH K220R was unable to rescue proper endosomal Arp2 / 3 complex localization ( Figures 6G and S5C ) . Importantly , YFP - WASH K220R localized properly to endosomes indicating that it still incorporated into the SHRC ( Figure S5C ) . These results suggest that ubiquitination of WASH K220 is required for WASH activa - tion and Arp2 / 3 complex endosomal localization . In Vitro Reconstitution of MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 and K63 - Ubiquitin - Dependent SHRC Activity Finally , we developed an in vitro reconstitution system to directly test whether ubiquitination of WASH is required for its actin assembling activity . To do so , we reconstituted WASH knock - out MEFs ( Gomez et al . , 2012 ) with stable expression of ( G ) Ubiquitinreplacement cells weretreatedwithorwithout tetracycline for72 – 96 hr .

The intact SHRC was then puriﬁed from each of these cell lines by anti - HA chro - matography to near homogeneity ( Figures S6A and S6B ) . Under these conditions , very little free WASH is present ( Figure S6B ) . The activity of the reconstituted SHRCs was ﬁrst assayed by examining their capacity to assemble F - actin on beads in cell lysates ( Cory et al . , 2003 ) . As expected , SHRC stimulated F - actin accumulation on beads in a manner dependent on the VCA motif of WASH and was inhibited by cytochalasin D ( Figure 7A ) . Impor - tantly , WASH knockout MEFs reconstituted with WASH K220R mutant did not support actin assembly on beads ( Figure 7A ) . In addition , the activity of SHRC was dependent on MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 , as SHRC isolated from MAGE - L2 - or TRIM27 - RNAi cells was signiﬁcantly less active ( Figure 7B ) .

To further examine the interplay of WASH ubiquitination and activity , we treated puriﬁed wild - type SHRC with the K63 - speciﬁc deubiqui - tinating enzyme AMSH . This treatment deconjugated K63 - ubiquitin chains from WASH ( Figure 7D ) and signiﬁcantly in - hibited SHRC activity on beads ( Figure 7E ) and in pyrene - actin assembly assays ( Figure 7F ) . These results suggest that K63 - ubiquitination of WASH K220 by MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 facilitates the activation of SHRC in a reversible manner . To determine if ubiquitination of WASH K220 may facilitate SHRC activation by disrupting autoinhibitory contacts in the meander region around WASH K220 , we mutated WASH K220 to aspartic acid ( K220D ) to destabilize autoinhibitory contacts in this region . Unlike inactive WASH K220R , WASH K220D is active in vitro ( Figures 7A and 7C ) and facilitates endosome - to - Golgi retrograde transport ( Figures 6D – 6F ) and endosomal Arp2 / 3 complex localization ( Figure 6G ) in cells . These results suggest that destabilizing the WASH meander region around the ubiquitination site can facilitate SHRC activity independent of ubiquitination . DISCUSSION MAGE proteins are a family of proteins that contain a conserved domain known as the MAGE homology domain . Recently , we showed that MAGE proteins function biochemically to bind to and enhance the activity of E3 RING ubiquitin ligases ( Doyle et al . , 2010 ) . In this study we investigated the cellular function of one speciﬁc MAGE protein , MAGE - L2 . Proteomic analysis re - vealed that MAGE - L2 speciﬁcally bound the TRIM27 E3 RING ubiquitin ligase . TRIM27 belongs to a large family of E3 RING ubiquitin ligases known as tripartite motif ( TRIM ) proteins . TRIM27 was originally identiﬁed and named Ret ﬁnger protein ( RFP ) , due to its discovery as a gene that undergoes a transloca - tion event with the Ret tyrosine kinase receptor in thyroid car - cinomas ( Saenko et al . , 2003 ; Takahashi and Cooper , 1987 ) . Subsequent work has implicated it in several processes , includ - ing transcriptional regulation , NF k B signaling , CD4 + T cell homeostasis , and as an oncogene ( Cai et al . , 2011 ; Kru¨tzfeldt et al . , 2005 ; Shimono et al . , 2000 ; Zha et al . , 2006 ; Zoumpoulidou et al . , 2012 ) . It will be of particular interest in the future to deter - mine if any of these diverse functions of TRIM27 are attributed to its regulation of WASH and vesicular transport . Cellular studies revealed that MAGE - L2 and TRIM27 colocal - ized on cytoplasmic structures that were determined to be retromer - positive endosomes . Of note , TRIM27 was previously shown to localize to similar structures that were unidentiﬁed at the time ( Harbers et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , the localization of TRIM27 was regulated by PKC , JNK , and RAS signaling path - ways . To determine if any of these signaling pathways may con - tribute to the upstream regulation of MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 and endosome - to - Golgi retrograde transport , we examined the effects of short - term inhibition of the PKC , JNK , MEK , and PI3K signaling pathways on the kinetics of surface CI - M6PR trafﬁcking to the TGN . Speciﬁc inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway blocked CI - M6PR retrieval to the TGN ( Figure S7 ) . Future studies into the mechanism by which JNK signaling regulates endosomal protein recycling will be of particular interest . Our mechanistic studies uncovered that K63 - linked ubiquiti - nation of WASH K220 by MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 is required for endosomal F - actin nucleation and retrograde transport . WASH K220 is predicted to exist in an analogous region on the SHRC as the meander region on the known WAVE regulatory complex structure . The meander region makes contacts with WAVE itself and SRA1 ( analogous to SWIP in SHRC ) and is essential for maintaining WAVE in an inactive state ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Importantly , this region is subjected to regulation by phosphory - lation ( Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ) . Thus , the proposed meander region on both the WAVE and WASH regulatory complexes may be regulated by posttranslational modiﬁcations , phosphor - ylation , and ubiquitination , respectively . In addition , WASH K220 is highly conserved in vertebrates where TRIM27 is found . How - ever , it is not conserved in invertebrates where TRIM27 orthologs are not present ( Boudinot et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , regulation of SHRC by ubiquitination is likely highly conserved in vertebrates , but additional forms of regulation are predicted in invertebrates . Our results suggest that ubiquitination of WASH facilitates activation by directly destabilizing autoinhibitory contacts in the SHRC , thus allowing VCA exposure , Arp2 / 3 complex binding , and subsequent F - actin assembly ( Figure 7G ) . Con - sistently , destabilizing these autoinhibitory contacts bypasses the requirement for WASH ubiquitination . In the context of the cell , other factors likely cooperate to further enhance activity , perhaps by clustering the active SHRC . Another likely point of regulation is in deactivating WASH after sufﬁcient endo - somal F - actin nucleation for retrograde trafﬁcking . Indeed , we ﬁnd that ubiquitin - mediated activation of SHRC is reversible . Future studies into relevant deubiquitinating enzymes will be of interest . Our ﬁndings also provide important insights into pathological conditions associated with MAGE - L2 , TRIM27 , and retrograde transport . Genes required for retrograde transport are fre - quently ampliﬁed in melanomas , contribute to tumorigenesis , and mediate trafﬁcking of proteins required for tumor progres - sion ( Scott et al . , 2009 ; Zech et al . , 2011 ) . Our ﬁndings extend this work to show that the TRIM27 oncogene facilitates integrin a 5 recycling , an important event in tumorigenesis . Additionally , retrograde transport has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease , where components of the pathway are downregulated and mutated ( Small , 2008 ) . Similarly , MAGE - L2 has been reported to be downregulated in the hippocampus of patients with incip - ient Alzheimer’s disease ( Blalock et al . , 2004 ) . Finally , retrograde transport is an essential pathway in which many microbial toxins and some viruses enter cells . Indeed , inhibition of TRIM27 blocks trafﬁcking of cholera toxin . Our results suggest a potential strategy to combat these pathogens .

Supplemental Information EXTENDED EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture and Transfections HEK293 ( ATCC ) , HeLa Tet - ON ( Clontech ) , or U2OS ( ATCC ) cells were grown in DMEM ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Hy - clone ) , 2 mM L - Glutamine ( Invitrogen ) , 100 units / ml penicillin ( Invitrogen ) , 100 mg / ml streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) , and 0 . 25 mg / ml amphotericin B ( Invitrogen ) . WASH knockout MEFs were cultured as previously described ( Gomez et al . , 2012 ) . U2OS ubiquitin replacement cells were grown under similar conditions . Cell lines in which ubiquitin knockdown and replacement with wild - type or K63R ubiquitin were described previously ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . Similar methods were performed to construct K48R ubiquitin replace - ment cells . Ubiquitin knockdown and replacement was induced by addition of 1 m g / ml tetracycline for 72 hr ( shUb and shUb - Ub [ K48R ] ) or 96 hr ( shUb - Ub [ WT ] and shUb - Ub [ K63R ] ) . Plasmid and siRNA transfection were performed for 48 - 96 hr with Effectene ( QIAGEN ) or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) , respectively , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . siRNAs siRNAs ( Thermo Dharmacon ) used in this study are : FAM21 ( 5 0 - GGUCUUAACUGGAUUACAA - 3 0 ) , MAGE - L2 # 1 ( 5 0 - UACCUAGA GUACAGGCGAAdTdT - 3 0 ) , MAGE - L2 # 3 ( 5 0 - ACACUGAGCCCGCAGAGUAdTdT - 3 0 ) , TRIM27 # 1 ( 5 0 - CGGAGAGUCUAAAGCA GUUdTdT - 3 0 ) , TRIM27 # 2 ( 5 0 - GAACCAGCUCGACCAUUUAdTdT - 3 0 ) , VPS35 ( 5 0 - AUUUGGUGCGCCUCAGUCAdTdT - 3 0 ) , and WASH ( 5 0 - CGCCACUGUGUUCUUCUCUAdTdT - 3 0 ) . siRNAs targeting ubiquitin E2 enzymes , mouse MAGE - L2 , and mouse TRIM27 were purchased as SmartPools ( Thermo Dharmacon ) . Negative control siRNAs ( siControl ) against an irrelevant gene ( LonRF1 ) were also purchased as a SmartPool ( Thermo Dharmacon ) . Simultaneous WASH knockdown and re - expression constructs were described previously ( Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . Antibodies Antibodies used in this study are as follows : anti - APC2 ( Tang et al . , 2001 ) , anti - ARPC5 ( 305011 ; Synaptic Systems ) , anti - CapZ a 1 ( AB6016 ; Millipore ) , anti - CapZB ( AB6017 ; Millipore ) , anti - Cathepsin D ( 219361 ; Calbiochem ) , anti - CCDC53 ( ABT69 ; Millipore ) , anti - CD49e Integrin a 5 ( 555616 ; BD PharMingen ) , anti - CI - M6PR ( AB2733 ; Abcam ) , anti - EEA1 ( 3288 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , anti - FAM21 ( ABT79 ; Millipore or as described previously [ Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ] ) , anti - GAPDH ( 2118 ; Cell Signaling Tech - nology ) , anti - goat IgG - HRP ( SC - 2056 ; Santa Cruz ) , anti - Golgin - 97 ( A - 21270 ; Invitrogen Molecular Probes ) , anti - hemagglutinin ( 12CA5 ; Roche ) , anit - K48 - linked ubiquitin ( 8081 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , anti - K63 - linked ubiquitin ( 05 - 1308 ; Millipore ; or 5621 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , anti - mouse IgG - HRP ( Amersham ) , anti - Myc ( 9E10 ; Roche ) , anti - rabbit IgG - HRP ( Amersham ) , anti - Strum - pellin ( SC - 87442 ; Santa Cruz ) , anti - SWIP ( ABT70 ; Millipore ) , anti - TGN46 ( T7576 ; Sigma ) , anti - TRIM27 ( 18791 ; IBL ) , anti - VPS26 ( AB23892 ; Abcam ) , anti - VPS29 ( GTX104768 ; GeneTex ) , anti - VPS35 ( AB10099 ; Abcam ) , and anti - WASH ( SAB4200373 ; Sigma or as described previously [ Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ] ) . Tandem Afﬁnity Puriﬁcation and Mass Spectrometry Tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ( TAP ) was performed using 293 / TAP - Vector or 293 / TAP - MAGE - L2 stable cell lines as described previ - ously ( Doyle et al . , 2010 ) . In brief , ten 150 mm 2 dishes of cells were lysed , bound to IgG Sepharose beads ( GE Amersham ) , cleaved off the beads with TEV protease , collected on Calmodulin Sepharose beads ( GE Amersham ) , eluted with SDS sample buffer , separated by SDS - PAGE , and stained with colloidal Coomassie blue ( Pierce ) . Unique protein bands were excised , in - gel proteolyzed , and iden - tiﬁed by LC / MS - MS . Protein Puriﬁcation and In Vitro Binding Assays GST - tagged VPS35 , GST - TRIM27 , and His - AMSH were produced in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells by overnight induction at 16 (cid:2) C with 0 . 5 mM Isopropyl b - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) and 100 m M ZnCl 2 in the case of GST - TRIM27 . GST - VPS35 and GST - TRIM27 were puriﬁed from bacterial lysates with glutathione Sepharose ( GE Amersham ) and eluted with 10 mM glutathione . His - AMSH was puri - ﬁed from bacterial lysates with Ni - NTA agarose ( QIAGEN ) and eluted with 250 mM imidazole . In vitro binding assays were performed as described previously ( Doyle et al . , 2010 ) . Brieﬂy , 15 m g of puriﬁed GST - tagged proteins were bound to glutathione Sepharose beads ( Amersham ) for 1 hr in binding buffer ( 25 mM Tris [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 137 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 , and 10 mM 2 - mer - captoethanol ) and then blocked for 1 hr in 5 % milk powder . In vitro translated proteins ( Promega SP6 - TNT Quick rabbit reticulocyte lysate system ) were then incubated with the bound beads for 1 hr , extensively washed , eluted with SDS - sample buffer , boiled , sub - jected to SDS - PAGE , and immunoblotting . Cathepsin D Secretion Assay Cathepsin D secretion was detected as previously described ( Rojas et al . , 2008 ) . In brief , 72 hr after RNAi or 96 hr after ubiquitin replacement , cells were washed and incubated for 16 hr in OPTI - MEM without serum . Adherent cells were collected in SDS - sample buffer for loading controls . The cell culture media were collected and centrifuged for 15 min at 16 , 000 3 g to pellet cell debris . The clariﬁed supernatant was treated with 0 . 02 % sodium deoxycholate for 30 min on ice . Proteins were precipitated in 15 % trichloro - acetic acid overnight at 4 (cid:2) C . Precipitated proteins were pelleted at 16 , 000 3 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:2) C , washed in ice - cold acetone twice , Cell 152 , 1051 – 1064 , February 28 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . S1 air - dried , resuspended in SDS - sample buffer , separated by SDS - PAGE , and immunoblotted . Equal loading was determined by pon - ceau S staining proteins precipitated from the media and immunoblotting of cell lysates . RT - QPCR RT - QPCR was performed as described previously ( Doyle et al . , 2010 ) . Brieﬂy , total RNA was extracted ( Qiagen ) , DNase treated ( Invitrogen ) , converted to cDNA with SuperScript III ( Invitrogen ) , and SYBR green QPCR ( Bio - Rad ) performed on an Abi - 7900HT instrument ( Applied Biosystems ) . Immunoﬂuorescence , Microscopy , and Quantitative Measurements Immunoﬂuorescence was performed essentially as described previously ( Potts and Yu , 2007 ) . Cells were washed in 1X PBS , ﬁxed for 15 min at room temperature in 3 % paraformaldehyde , washed in 1 3 PBS twice , and incubated in blocking solution ( PBS containing 3 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] and 0 . 1 % saponin ) for 20 min at 4 (cid:2) C . After blocking , cells were incubated in blocking solution con - taining approximately 2 m g / ml of each primary antibody for 60 min at room temperature . Cells were then washed three times in PBS containing 0 . 1 % saponin and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in blocking solution containing 4 m g / ml Alexa - 488 , Alexa - 568 , or Alexa - 647 secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen Molecular Probes ) . After incubation , cells were washed three times in PBS con - taining 0 . 1 % saponin , DNA stained in 1 m g / ml 4’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) for 2 min , washed in PBS , and mounted . For F - actin staining , 33 nM Alexa - 568 - conjugated Phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature following primary antibody staining . Cells were imaged with a 63 3 or 100 3 objective on a DeltaVision or Nikon TiU inverted ﬂuorescence microscope . Images were acquired with a CoolSnap HQ2 charge - coupled device camera ( Photometrics ) at 0 . 3 m m intervals , deconvolved using the nearest neighbor algorithm , and stacked to better resolve endosome structures . Intensity measurements were performed using ImageJ Soft - ware . For those experiments speciﬁcally quantitating the amount of endosomal localized F - actin or ARPC5 , images were thresholded using the endosomal markers FAM21 , VPS35 , or WASH and intensity measurements were performed only on the F - actin or ARPC5 signal colocalizing . Quantitation of CI - M6PR trafﬁcking was performed by blind analysis of the percentage of cells showing compact juxtanuclear ( normal ) or dispersed ( abnormal ) CI - M6PR staining . At least 50 – 100 cells were counted for each condition in each exper - iment . Statistical analysis was performed using two - tailed unpaired Student’s t test . For assaying retrograde transport of cell surface CI - M6PR , cells were incubated for 60 min or the indicated times at 37 (cid:2) C in serum - free media ( DMEM containing 1 % BSA , and 25 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 4 ] ) containing 10 m g / ml of monoclonal antibody against the luminal domain of CI - M6PR . Cells were washed in serum - free media three times to remove excess unbound anti - CI - M6PR antibody . Cells were then ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained with secondary antibody ( anti - mouse Alexa - 488 ) only . For live - cell microscopy , cells were grown in 4 - well chambered coverglasses ( Lab - Tek ) and imaged on a DeltaVision inverted ﬂuorescence microscope with envi - ronmental chamber . Single plane images were acquired every 500 ms . Time - lapse images were processed and analyzed by ImageJ Software . Flow Cytometry Analysis HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 72 hr before staining with 10 m g / ml anti - CD49e ( Integrin a 5 ; BD PharMingen ) or IgG isotype control for 30 min on ice . Cells were washed twice and incubated with secondary anti - mouse Alexa - 488 antibody for 30 min on ice . Cells were washed three times and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry . Cell Invasion Assay HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 48 hr and subsequently serum starved for 16 hr . One hundred thousand cells were then plated in serum - free media on matrigel - coated 8 m m transwell invasion chambers ( BD Biosciences ) with a chemoat - tractant media containing 2 . 5 % FBS in the bottom chamber . Twenty - four hours after plating , noninvaded cells were scraped off and invaded cells on the bottom of the transwell membrane were stained with DAPI and crystal violet . The numbers of cells in each ﬁeld were counted using a 10X objective . Actin Assembly Assays and Puriﬁcation of SHRC WASH knockout MEFs were prepared and characterized previously ( Gomez et al . , 2012 ) . The WASH knockout MEFs were recon - stituted with HA - GFP - tagged human WASH wild - type , D VCA , K220R , or K220D by retroviral infection and selection . Equal expres - sion of mutants at levels comparable to endogenous was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting ( data not shown ) . In vitro actin assembly on beads using cell lysates was performed as described previously ( Cory et al . , 2003 ) . Brieﬂy , one 15 cm 2 plate of WASH knockout MEFs reconstituted with the indicated HA - GFP - tagged WASH proteins was lysed in 1 ml of NP - 40 lysis buffer containing MgCl 2 ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 7 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail ) . Lysate protein concentrations were estimated using Bradford Assay ( Bio - Rad ) and normalized to 2 mg / ml . HA - GFP - WASH incorporated into SHRC was puriﬁed using anti - HA agarose beads ( Sigma ) by overnight incubation . Beads were extensively washed in NP - 40 lysis buffer containing MgCl 2 and ﬁxed in 3 % paraformaldehyde . F - actin on SHRC - captured beads was stained with 66 nM Alexa - 568 - conjugated Phalloi - din and beads were squashed on slides and imaged . For examining the dependence of MAGE - L2 - TRIM27 , WASH knockout MEFs reconstituted with HA - GFP - WASH were transfected with mouse MAGE - L2 or mouse TRIM27 siRNAs for 72 hr before puriﬁcation of S2 Cell 152 , 1051 – 1064 , February 28 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . SHRC and assaying activity as described above . In the indicated samples , clariﬁed cell lysates were treated with 3 . 5 m M AMSH for 1 hr at 30 (cid:2) C or with 10 m M cytochalasin D before incubation with anti - HA beads . For in vitro pyrene - actin assembly assays , the tagged WASH SHRC complex was puriﬁed to near homogeneity from ten 15 cm 2 plates of WASH knockout MEFs reconstituted with the indicated HA - GFP - tagged WASH proteins . Cell pellets were lysed in NP - 40 lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , [ pH 7 . 7 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 1 mM DTT , and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail ) and clariﬁed by centrifugation and ﬁltration . Clariﬁed lysates were bound to 1 ml of anti - HA agarose beads ( Sigma ) and washed extensively in lysis buffer . The SHRC was eluted six times with 100 m g / ml 3X HA peptide ( Sigma ) . The elutions were pooled , concentrated , and assayed for all SHRC components and purity by western blotting , Coomassie staining , and mass spectrometry . Note , HA - GFP - WASH was present at stoichiometric levels to other SHRC proteins , suggesting very little free HA - GFP - WASH in our preparations . Pyrene - actin assembly assays were performed as described previously ( Leung et al . , 2006 ) . Brieﬂy , actin was puriﬁed from rabbit muscle and the Arp2 / 3 complex was puriﬁed from bovine thymus . Actin assembly assays contained 4 m M actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) , 10 nM Arp2 / 3 complex in KMEI - 15G buffer ( 15 % ( w / v ) glycerol , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , and 10 mM imidazole [ pH 7 . 0 ] ) . In the indicated samples , puriﬁed SHRC was treated with buffer or 3 . 5 m M AMSH for 1 hr at 30 (cid:2) C before pyrene - actin assembly assays . SUPPLEMENTAL REFERENCES Leung , D .
