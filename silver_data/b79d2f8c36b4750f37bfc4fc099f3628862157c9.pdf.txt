This creates a new bottleneck : determining the functional impact of each variant 41 – largely a painstaking , customized process undertaken one or a few genes or variants at a time . 42 Here , we established a high - throughput imaging platform to assay the impact of coding variation 43 on protein localization , evaluating 3 , 547 missense variants of over 1 , 000 genes and phenotypes . 44 We discovered that mislocalization is a common consequence of coding variation , affecting about 45 one - sixth of all pathogenic missense variants , all cellular compartments , and recessive and 46 dominant disorders alike . Mislocalization is primarily driven by effects on protein stability and 47 membrane insertion rather than disruptions of trafficking signals or specific interactions . 48 Furthermore , mislocalization patterns help explain pleiotropy and disease severity and provide 49 insights on variants of unknown significance . Our publicly available resource will likely accelerate 50 the understanding of coding variation in human diseases . 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 3 INTRODUCTION 58 59 Pathogenic coding variants underlie many human diseases , from rare Mendelian disorders to 60 complex traits , cancer , and neurodegeneration . Rapid advances in genome and exome 61 sequencing technologies have uncovered hundreds of thousands of coding variants associated 62 with these diseases , vastly outpacing our ability to interrogate the effects of coding variation on 63 protein function . This glaring disparity has resulted in two major challenges . On one hand , due to 64 the lack of functional assays , most coding variants in disease genes remain classified as variants 65 of unknown significance ( VUS ) , posing a major roadblock for the clinical interpretation of coding 66 variation 1 . On the other hand , even if a given coding variant is deemed pathogenic , it is often not 67 known how exactly it disrupts protein function 2 , 3 . Thus , characterizing the functional 68 consequences of coding variants is highly relevant to clinical genetics , understanding disease 69 pathogenesis , and developing novel therapies . 70 71 Diseases caused by coding variation are immensely diverse , affecting different cellular processes , 72 tissue types , and developmental stages . Yet , despite this phenotypic diversity , the molecular 73 mechanisms by which coding variants disrupt protein function are much more constrained 2 , 4 . 74 Mutations often impinge on protein stability , rewire interactions by disrupting existing or 75 introducing new interactions with other biomolecules , or perturb protein subcellular localization . 76 The most common disruptive mechanism is likely the loss of protein stability . Because most 77 proteins are only marginally stable 5 , single amino acid changes can easily destabilize protein folds 78 and promote protein misfolding . Experimental studies have suggested that 30 % - 60 % of all 79 pathogenic missense variants are destabilizing 6 , 7 . Similarly , pathogenic mutations are enriched in 80 known protein - protein interaction interfaces and can disrupt interactions with nucleic acids or 81 small molecules 7 – 14 . Our previous work suggests that up to 30 % of pathogenic missense 82 mutations disrupt specific protein - protein interactions , i . e . affect some interactions while leaving 83 4 others unperturbed , indicating that interactome rewiring is a widespread mechanism of 84 pathogenesis 7 . 85 86 While large - scale studies and computational approaches have shed light on the frequency of 87 mutations affecting protein stability and interactions , much less is known about mutational effects 88 on protein localization . Correct subcellular localization is fundamental to the function of all 89 proteins , and mislocalization plays a central role in diverse human diseases 2 , 15 – 18 . For example , 90 the most common mutation underlying cystic fibrosis , CFTR ΔF508 , leads to the retention of the 91 mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) due to ER quality control 19 . Pharmacological 92 correction of CFTR ΔF508 trafficking to the plasma membrane can restore much of CFTR’s 93 activity as a chloride channel , significantly ameliorating symptoms in patients 20 . Similarly , 94 mislocalization of tumor suppressors such as PTEN and BRCA1 and oncogenes such as AKT1 95 and NPM1 has been causally implicated in tumorigenesis 21 – 24 . Finally , aberrant localization of 96 proteins to aggregates or phase - separated condensates is a defining hallmark of most 97 neurodegenerative diseases , illustrated by α - synuclein aggregation in Parkinson’s disease and 98 FUS ( fused in sarcoma ) phase separation in amyotrophic leukodystrophy ( ALS ) 25 . 99 100 Despite many such examples of mislocalized pathogenic variants , computational analyses have 101 suggested that fewer than 2 % of pathogenic disease variants are mislocalized 17 . However , this is 102 likely a significant underestimate because accurate prediction of mislocalization is difficult . Protein 103 localization can be regulated by diverse mechanisms , such as compartment - specific sorting 104 signals , protein - protein interactions , cell - state dependent signaling events , ligand binding , or the 105 protein quality control machinery . Disruption of any of these mechanisms could lead to 106 mislocalization . Thus , the full extent to which aberrant protein localization contributes to diverse 107 diseases is still unknown . 108 109 5 Here , we systematically assess how pathogenic coding variants affect protein localization . We 110 use high - content microscopy to characterize the localization pattern of 3 , 547 missense variants 111 of 1 , 282 proteins involved in diverse Mendelian disorders and tumorigenesis . Our results reveal 112 that mislocalization is a common phenotype that involves all cellular compartments , with a 113 particularly pronounced role for proteins trafficked through the secretory pathway . Mislocalization 114 equally affects dominant and recessive disorders as well as somatic mutations underlying cancer . 115 We further show that changes in subcellular localization can reveal mechanisms of pleiotropy and 116 help classify variants of unknown significance . We provide the full dataset of images and data as 117 an open - access resource for researchers studying rare diseases and mechanisms of protein 118 trafficking . 119 120 RESULTS 121 122 Systematic analysis of protein localization 123 124 To systematically characterize the effect of mutations on protein localization , we used a previously 125 described collection of missense variants ( hmORFeome1 . 1 ) , which contains 3 , 046 variants 126 across 1 , 139 genes annotated in the Human Gene Mutation Database ( HGMD ) , in addition to 127 their wild - type , or “reference” , counterparts 7 , 26 . We complemented this collection with another set 128 of 136 variants ( 109 missense variants and 27 fusion proteins ) in 43 genes encoding protein 129 kinases and chaperone client proteins 27 , 28 , 295 variants of 115 genes found in cancer genome 130 sequencing projects 29 , and 70 likely non - pathogenic variants of 40 genes identified in exome 131 sequencing studies 7 . Altogether , our collection includes 3 , 547 variants across 1 , 282 unique 132 genes , highly enriched for pathogenic and damaging variants based on ClinVar annotations and 133 PolyPhen predictions 30 , 31 ( Figures 1A , 1B , S1A , and Table S1 ) . The collection broadly covers 134 6 variants with autosomal recessive , autosomal dominant , and X - linked inheritance patterns as well 135 as somatic variants and susceptibility alleles ( Figure 1C ) . 136 137 We transfected 3xFLAG - V5 tagged reference and variant constructs into HeLa cells in a 96 - well 138 format . After 48 hours , cells were fixed and stained with anti - FLAG antibody and with subcellular 139 markers for nucleus ( Hoechst ) , membranes and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ; concanavalin A ) , 140 and mitochondria ( MitoTracker ) . We used an automated high - content confocal microscope to 141 image 25 fields at three different Z planes of each well using a 63x objective , providing a robust 142 dataset for downstream analysis . All microscopy images were analyzed visually by two 143 independent observers and computationally with a custom CellProfiler pipeline 32 ( Figures 1D , 1E , 144 and 1F ) . Visual and computational annotation both indicated that about 60 % of tagged reference 145 and variant proteins were detected in more than 50 cells ( Figure S1B and S1C ) . Only 12 % of 146 proteins were not detected at all ( Figure S1B ) , possibly due to low stability or secretion , indicating 147 that our transient transfection protocol provides a robust method for ectopically expressing a large 148 collection of diverse proteins . 149 150 We then visually annotated the localization patterns of the detectable reference proteins and their 151 variants , finding the localizations to be generally concordant with publicly available annotations . 152 Excluding secreted proteins that cannot be accurately detected by imaging , over 70 % of the 153 detectable reference proteins were localized to at least one of the compartment annotations in six 154 different data sources , including UniProt and the Human Protein Atlas 33 , as well as four 155 independent mass spectrometry - based approaches ( Figure 1G ) 34 – 37 . These results are in line 156 with previous experiments comparing transfection of epitope - tagged proteins and 157 immunofluorescence with antibodies against endogenous proteins 38 . Notably , only the Itzhak et 158 al . study used HeLa cells , suggesting protein localization is not generally cell - type dependent . To 159 test this more directly , we randomly selected 118 reference and variant proteins and transiently 160 7 transfected them into HeLa , RPE1 , and U2OS cells . Although some proteins showed subtle 161 differences in localization between cell lines , all tested reference or variant proteins were either 162 highly similar or identical when comparing all three cell lines ( Figure S1D and S1E ) . Variant 163 mislocalization could also be detected in all three cell lines ( Figure S1F ) . We conclude that 164 ectopic expression of epitope - tagged proteins is generally a reliable method for detecting protein 165 localization and is not overly influenced by the cell type . 166 167 The most common localization compartments for reference proteins were cytoplasm ( 32 % ) , 168 endoplasmic reticulum ( 26 % ) , nucleoplasm ( 14 % ) , mitochondria ( 8 % ) , plasma membrane ( 7 % ) , 169 and Golgi apparatus ( 7 % ) ( Figure S1G ) . However , the majority ( 54 % ) of reference proteins 170 localized to multiple compartments . The ER and mitochondria contained the most specifically - 171 localized proteins , while the plasma membrane , Golgi apparatus , vesicles , cytoplasm , and 172 nucleus contained more multi - localizing proteins ( Figure S1H ) . These patterns are concordant 173 with previous studies in both human and yeast cells 33 , 39 . 174 175 176 8 177 Figure 1 . Systematic profiling of subcellular localization of missense variants .

I ) Correlation coefficient of localization 185 patterns between reference alleles and missense variants for non - hits , low penetrance hits and high 186 penetrance hits . Statistical significance was calculated with ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple 187 testing . 188 189 Widespread mislocalization of pathogenic missense variants 190 191 We then examined the extent to which variants found in humans change the localization of their 192 respective reference proteins . Variants that had a visually different localization pattern than the 193 reference ( as assessed by either of the two observers ) were classified as high penetrance ( more 194 than 50 % of cells showed a phenotype ) or low penetrance ( fewer than 50 % of the cells with 195 differing phenotype ) . We complemented the visual analysis with a computational analysis based 196 on 340 morphological features extracted by a custom CellProfiler pipeline ( Figure 1E ) 32 . The wild - 197 type / mutant impact was assessed by measuring the distance between the morphological 198 representation of each wild - type / mutant morphological profile ( see Method Details ) . Negative 199 correlation coefficient between well - level preprocessed and aggregated morphological profiles of 200 wild - type / mutant pairs was scaled to a [ 0 , 1 ] range and used as the measure of distance ( impact 201 score ) . All variants that were scored as mislocalized by either visual examination or computational 202 analysis were re - arrayed and tested with a second , independent round of transfection and 203 immunofluorescence . Variants that passed the secondary validation round ( which used the same 204 analysis parameters ) were considered final mislocalized hits . Highlighting the complementary 205 nature of our approaches , computational analysis detected several subtle changes in localization 206 that were missed by manual observation , whereas manual annotation identified cases where only 207 a limited number of cells expressed the reference or variant protein or cases in which the 208 phenotype was visible in only a fraction of cells . Even so , the approaches were generally in good 209 agreement : hits identified visually had a significantly higher impact score relative to their reference 210 counterpart than non - hits ( Figure 1H ) . Moreover , higher - penetrance hits ( as defined manually ) 211 10 had a more dramatic impact on computationally - determined localization than lower - penetrance 212 hits and non - hits ( Figure 1I ) . 213 214 Figure 2 . Mislocalization map of missense variants . The overall pattern of mislocalization is shown in 215 the center . Each line represents a mislocalized variant . The color of the line indicates destination 216 compartment ( i . e . mislocalization compartment ) . Examples of mislocalized variants for different categories 217 are shown with manual annotation and the associated disease phenotype . Scale bar , 20 µm . 218 219 Our screen identified 250 ( 11 % ) confirmed mislocalized variants out of 2 , 280 variants that were 220 detected by imaging ( Figure 2 ) . These variants represented 152 distinct genes ; 16 % of genes 221 had at least one mislocalized missense variant . However , nearly 40 % of genes for which we 222 11 assayed four or more variants had at least one mislocalized variant ( Figure S2A ) . Thus , missense 223 variation can affect the localization of a substantial portion of the proteome . 224 225 Mislocalized variants were not equally distributed among genes : if a gene had one mislocalized 226 variant , it was significantly more likely to have multiple such variants than expected by chance ( p 227 < 0 . 0001 , Fisher’s exact test ; Figure 3A ) . Thus , mislocalization disproportionately affects some 228 gene products while sparing others . We observed a similar trend with localization patterns . We 229 identified 53 different localization categories from one compartment to another , representing all 230 major cellular compartments ( Figure 2 ) . We found that some compartments were significantly 231 more likely to be involved in mislocalization . For example , proteins normally localized to the 232 plasma membrane , Golgi , and vesicles were enriched in mislocalized variants , whereas those 233 localized to the cytoplasm or mitochondria were depleted ( Figure 3B ) . In total , 59 % ( 148 / 250 ) of 234 mislocalization events included the secretory pathway ( ER , Golgi , plasma membrane , or vesicles ) 235 as the reference or variant localization , although these proteins represented only 36 % of the 236 library ( p < 0 . 0001 ; Fisher’s exact test ; Figure 3C ) . These results are consistent with the well - 237 established role of ER in protein quality control 40 . Another class of proteins that displayed frequent 238 mislocalization were cytoskeletal proteins such as keratins , actin , and tubulin , whose assembly 239 into long filaments is central to their function ( Figures 3B and 3D ) . 240 241 One prominent class of mislocalization was the formation of discrete foci or clusters by 14 % 242 ( 34 / 250 ) of the hits , representing 34 distinct proteins ( Figures 2 and 3E ) , across a range of 243 baseline reference locations . Among the focus - forming variants were known aggregation - prone 244 proteins , such as germline variants CRYAB R120G and CRYBB1 S228P 41 , 42 and multiple somatic 245 variants of the cancer driver SPOP ( Figure 3E ) . Two prostate cancer associated variants of the 246 SPOP E3 ligase ( W133G and W133C ) formed visibly larger and rounder foci in the nucleus than 247 the reference protein ( Figure 3E ) . These larger foci likely represent membraneless granules 248 12 previously reported for SPOP 43 . Interestingly , two endometrial cancer - associated SPOP mutants 249 ( E47A and E50K ) did not form any foci ( Figure 3E ) , indicating that oncogenic variants associated 250 with different tumor types show distinct localization phenotypes . SPOP localization is affected by 251 its substrates 44 , and the endometrial and prostate cancer associated variants have distinct effects 252 on SPOP substrates such as BRD3 and BRD4 45 , likely explaining the difference in localization . 253 254 We then asked whether variants whose mislocalization involved loss or gain of foci had features 255 distinguishing them from other mislocalized variants . We found distinct features that were 256 consistent with these variants functioning through a toxic gain - of - function mechanism due to 257 aggregation or condensate dysregulation . First , focus - forming and focus - dissolving variants were 258 enriched for those that function in a dominant manner , compared to other mislocalized variants 259 ( Figure 3F ) . Second , they were significantly enriched in mutations predicted to dysregulate 260 condensate formation , both when compared to other mislocalized variants and to normally 261 localized variants ( Figure 3G ) 46 . Our results suggest that aggregation and / or condensate 262 dysregulation are common mechanisms of variant mislocalization and human disease 263 pathogenesis , consistent with recent reports 18 , 46 . 264 265 266 13 267 Figure 3 .

Statistical significance was calculated with Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni 282 correction for multiple hypotheses . 283 284 285 Features associated with variant mislocalization 286 287 To understand the causes underlying protein mislocalization , we compared features of 288 mislocalized variants to normally localized variants . Overall , mislocalization occurred at a similar 289 rate between dominant and recessive variants and between germline and somatic variants 290 ( Figures S2B and S2C ) , indicating that protein mislocalization broadly affects all types of 291 variation . However , mislocalized variants were significantly enriched in pathogenic variants and 292 depleted of benign variants , as assessed by ClinVar and Polyphen2 ( Figures 4A and 4B ) , and 293 they had a significantly lower population frequency than normally localized variants ( Figure 294 S2D ) 30 , 47 . Indeed , not a single common variant from exome sequencing studies ( 0 / 36 ) , and only 295 6 % ( 9 / 162 ) of variants annotated in ClinVar as benign or likely benign were mislocalized . In 296 contrast , 16 % ( 135 / 822 ) of those annotated as pathogenic or likely pathogenic showed a distinct 297 localization pattern from the reference protein ( p < 0 . 001 , Fisher’s exact test ; Figure 4C ) . This 298 pattern was even more pronounced for proteins normally localized to the secretory pathway : 23 % 299 of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in these proteins were mislocalized ( Figure S2E ) . 300 301 We identified nine mislocalized variants classified as benign or likely benign in ClinVar . However , 302 further investigation revealed that at least six of these have been shown to have altered activity 303 or localization in functional assays 7 , 48 – 53 , corroborating our results . These variants may be 304 misannotated in ClinVar or cause partially penetrant phenotypes that do not manifest themselves 305 in all individuals . Alternatively , it is possible that these missense mutations functionally affect the 306 15 protein without having an influence on the organismal phenotype , as has been observed for some 307 protein / protein interaction disrupting variants 54 . 308 309 Aberrant protein localization can be caused by mutations that disrupt post - translational 310 modification sites , specific protein - protein interactions , or trafficking signals such as the nuclear 311 localization signal or the signal peptide . Alternatively , it can be caused by mutations that disrupt 312 protein stability , leading to protein misfolding and trapping in intermediary compartments such as 313 the ER 2 . To understand the relative contributions of these alternatives , we investigated the 314 characteristics of the missense mutations leading to mislocalization . 315 316 Only five of the 250 mislocalized variants contained a mutation in a known post - translational 317 modification site ( Figure 4D ) . Notably , two of these variants impact a phosphoserine site in 318 proteins normally localized to microtubules ( TUBB2 S172P and DCX S47R ) and have been 319 previously reported to affect protein localization and function 55 , 56 . We observed similar phenotypes 320 for these variants ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting that our approach could capture variant effects on PTM 321 sites . However , overall mislocalized variants were not enriched for mutations in PTM sites , 322 including disulfide bridges ( Figures 4D and S2F ) . 323 324 16 325 Figure 4 . Features associated with mislocalization . A ) Mislocalized variants are enriched in pathogenic 326 and likely pathogenic variants . B ) Mislocalized variants are predicted to be more damaging by Polyphen - 2 . 327 C ) Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants are mislocalized more often than benign or likely benign 328 variants . D ) Mutations causing mislocalization are not enriched in post - translational modification sites . E ) 329 Mutations causing mislocalization do not disrupt protein - protein interactions more often than mutations 330 leading to normal localization , as assessed by yeast two - hybrid assay and validated by orthogonal assays 7 . 331 F ) Mutations causing mislocalization are not enriched in signal peptides . G ) Mutations causing 332 mislocalization are highly enriched in transmembrane domains . H ) Mislocalized variants interact more with 333 chaperones and quality - control factors than normally localized variants , as determined by LUMIER assays 7 . 334 17 I - K ) Comparison of chaperone and quality control factor interactions of reference proteins and mislocalized 335 or normally localized proteins for Hsp70 / HSPA8 ( I ) , Grp78 / HSPA5 ( J ) , and Chip / STUB1 ( K ) . Statistical 336 significance was calculated with a chi - square test ( panels A and B ) , Fisher’s exact test ( panels D - H ) , and 337 Mann - Whitney test ( panels I - K ) 338 339 Disruption of protein - protein interactions ( PPIs ) similarly was not a major cause of mislocalization 340 patterns , although again our strategy identified known examples . PPIs can orchestrate the 341 trafficking of proteins to specific compartments 57 . We found that MCDF2 D81Y , which underlies 342 Combined Deficiency of Factor V and Factor VIII ( OMIM 613625 ) , was mislocalized from the Golgi 343 apparatus to the ER ( Figure 2 ) . Mislocalization of MCFD2 D81Y has been attributed to the loss 344 of interaction with LMAN1 , a cargo receptor - like protein that cycles between the ER and Golgi 345 apparatus 58 . To examine the overall contribution of protein - protein interaction patterns on protein 346 localization , we assessed if mislocalized variants were more likely to exhibit PPI perturbations . 347 We therefore compared our imaging results with a previously generated dataset of interactions 348 for the hmORFeome 1 . 1 collection 7 . There was no significant difference in the frequency of 349 interaction - disrupting mutations between mislocalized and normally localized variants ( Figure 350 4E ) , suggesting that disruptions in specific PPIs are not a major cause of mislocalization . 351 Consistent with this notion , mutation frequencies in signal peptides and mitochondrial leader 352 peptides , which are recognized by specific PPIs , were also similar between the two groups of 353 variants ( Figure 4F ) . Thus , while the examples highlighted here indicate that our platform could 354 identify known cases of mislocalization due to disruptions in PPIs and PTMs , overall , these do 355 not seem to significantly contribute to protein mislocalization . 356 357 In contrast to mutations affecting PTMs , signal peptides , and specific protein - protein interactions , 358 mislocalized variants were highly enriched in mutations that interfere with protein folding or 359 insertion of transmembrane domains into the membrane . Insertion into the lipid bilayer is primarily 360 driven by interactions between aliphatic hydrophobic residues in a transmembrane domain ( TMD ) 361 18 and the lipid hydrocarbon chains in the lipid membrane . Nearly 20 % of mislocalized variants had 362 a mutation in an annotated TMD , in contrast to only 5 % of normally localized variants ( p < 0 . 0001 ; 363 Fisher’s exact test ; Figure 4G ) . Moreover , TMD mutations in mislocalized variants were 364 significantly enriched in non - conservative substitutions compared to normally localized variants 365 ( Figures S2G and S2H ) . 366 367 To assess the contribution of protein stability , we compared how mislocalized and normally 368 localized variants interacted with chaperones and other cellular quality control factors , which was 369 characterized in our previous study 7 . Mislocalized variants were significantly more likely to interact 370 more with one or more quality control factors than normally localized variants ( Figure 4H ) . 371 However , the pattern was not identical between different quality control factors . For example , 372 mislocalized variants interacted significantly more with Hsp70 family chaperones in the cytoplasm 373 ( Hsc70 ) and ER ( Grp78 ) but not with Hsp90 family chaperones ( cytoplasmic Hsp90 and ER - 374 resident Grp94 ) ( Figures 4I - J and S2I - J ) . Consistent with this , Hsp70 cochaperones STUB1 and 375 BAG2 also interacted more with mislocalized variants ( Figures 4K and S2K ) . The difference 376 between Hsp70 and Hsp90 interactions reflects the functional differences between these 377 conserved chaperone families . Hsp70 is an early - stage chaperone that promotes de novo folding 378 and trafficking of its clients , whereas Hsp90 acts at a later stage and with a more limited set of 379 clients 28 , 59 , 60 . In any case , these results establish that protein instability , rather than loss of specific 380 protein / protein interactions , is a major factor driving protein mislocalization . 381 382 Imaging provides insights into mechanisms of variant pathogenicity and disease severity 383 384 Disruptions of specific protein / protein interactions can explain pleiotropy , i . e . where two mutations 385 in the same gene cause distinct diseases 7 . We hypothesized that protein localization could 386 underlie pleiotropy in a similar manner . We therefore focused on cases where two variants of a 387 19 gene had distinct localization patterns and asked whether the associated phenotype annotations 388 were concordant or discordant . Indeed , variant pairs that were differentially localized were 389 significantly enriched for discordant disease annotations compared to pairs that were similarly 390 localized ( Figure 5A ) . 391 392 To investigate if localization patterns could similarly provide insights into disease severity , we 393 surveyed the literature for mislocalized variants that had annotations for disease severity or age 394 of onset . We found such annotations for PLP1 and GFAP variants , underlying distinct 395 leukodystrophies . PLP1 ( myelin proteolipid protein ) mutations cause Pelizaeus - Merzbacher 396 disease , a demyelinating disorder that is manifested as a spectrum of symptoms contingent on 397 the genotype 61 . Gain - of - function mutations in GFAP ( Glial fibrillary acidic protein ) cause 398 autosomal dominant Alexander disease , which has a highly variable disease presentation and 399 age of onset 62 . In both cases , we observed a strong correlation between disease severity and the 400 extent of mislocalization . PLP1 W163L , which is associated with a very mild form of Pelizaeus - 401 Merzbacher disease 63 , showed slightly decreased plasma membrane staining compared to the 402 reference protein , whereas three variants underlying severe ( connatal ) disease lost all plasma 403 membrane localization ( Figure 5B ) . This concordance between subcellular localization and 404 patient phenotype is consistent with a previous study with two other PLP1 variants 64 . GFAP 405 variant localization ranged from reference - like intermediate filament localization to diffuse 406 cytoplasmic staining to prominent cytoplasmic punctae , likely reflecting pathogenic aggregation 62 407 ( Figure 5B ) . The localization pattern correlated with the age of onset of the disease : the E207Q 408 variant associated with the oldest age of onset showed only a partial diffuse localization , whereas 409 the R258P variant with the youngest age of onset was localized to distinct punctae . The third 410 pathogenic variant ( E374G ) , associated with an intermediate age of onset , localized mostly to the 411 cytoplasm , with some cells showing weak punctate staining . Thus , our results suggest that protein 412 mislocalization is associated with both pleiotropy and disease severity . 413 20 414 Figure 5 . Mislocalization and disease phenotypes . A ) Variants of the same gene that have a distinct 415 localization pattern are more often associated with distinct disease phenotypes than variants that are 416 similarly localized . Statistical significance was calculated with Fisher’s exact test . B ) Top , loss of membrane 417 localization of PLP1 variants is concordant with disease manifestation . Bottom , loss of intermediate filament 418 staining and appearance of distinct punctae ( arrowheads ) with GFAP variants correlates with age of onset . 419 21 C ) Distinct localization of beta - actin variants underlying different diseases . Filamentous actin staining with 420 phalloidin ( magenta ) shows distinct patterns with wild - type actin and each mutant . D ) Proximity 421 interactomes of wild - type actin and R183W and E364K variants were determined by BioID in HEK293 cells . 422 The graph shows selected interactions ; the full dataset is available in Table S1 E ) Mislocalization of SMAD2 423 D304G variant from the nucleus to the cytoplasm . Wild - type and mutant SMAD2 - 3xFLAG - V5 constructs 424 were transfected into HeLa and U2OS cells and stained with anti - FLAG antibody ( green ) . F ) SMAD2 D304G 425 interacts less with the transcriptional co - regulator SKI and more with the TGFβ receptor TGFBR1 . Indicated 426 3xFLAG - V5 tagged constructs were co - transfected into HEK293T cells with Nanoluc - tagged wild - type 427 SMAD2 or the D304G variant , and interaction was assayed with LUMIER assay . Statistical significance 428 was calculated with ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple hypotheses . * * * , p < 0 . 001 , * , p < 0 . 05 . G ) 429 SMAD2 D304G is a weaker transactivator than wild - type SMAD2 . Indicated constructs were co - transfected 430 with 3TP - lux reporter and Nanoluc control into MDA - 231 cells and the cells were treated with vehicle control 431 or TGFβ . Transactivation activity measured with luciferase assay . The ratio between Firefly and Nanoluc 432 luminescence was normalized to EGFP control with vehicle treatment . Statistical significance was 433 calculated with ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple hypotheses . * * * , p < 0 . 001 , * , p < 0 . 05 . 434 435 436 We then searched for examples where our imaging results could provide insight into the potential 437 pathogenic mechanisms of variants with distinct localization patterns . Among our hits were two 438 β - actin ( ACTB ) variants , R183W and E364K . In humans , these variants lead to distinct 439 phenotypes : R183W was found in a patient with developmental malformations , deafness , and 440 delayed - onset dystonia 65 , whereas E364K is associated with neutrophil dysfunction 66 . In vitro 441 assays with purified proteins have not revealed dramatic changes in these variants’ thermal 442 stability compared to the wild - type protein . However , the two mutations have similar but modest 443 effects on the polymerization and ATP hydrolysis activity of actin 67 . Moreover , in vitro studies with 444 the E364K mutant have provided conflicting evidence as to its effects on folding and profilin 445 binding 66 – 68 , and this variant is classified as a VUS in ClinVar . 446 447 In contrast to these in vitro assays , imaging revealed striking differences in the localization of 448 ACTB R183W and E364K compared to wild - type β - actin . ACTB R183W formed remarkable 449 filaments overlapping the nucleus , whereas ACTB E364K showed reduced protein levels and did 450 22 not form any filaments ( Figure 5C ) . Staining filamentous actin with phalloidin corroborated these 451 results : cells expressing the R183W variant displayed prominent actin filaments , whereas E364K - 452 expressing cells had less prominent F - actin staining than those expressing wild - type actin . 453 454 To gain more insight into how these mutations lead to distinct phenotypes , we characterized the 455 interactomes of wild - type ACTB and the two variants with proximity - dependent biotinylation 456 ( BioID ) . We generated stable tetracycline - inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing each construct 457 fused to the FLAG epitope and the abortive biotin ligase BirA * , which promotes biotinylation of 458 proximal proteins . We first analyzed construct localization by anti - FLAG immunofluorescence and 459 streptavidin staining after biotin treatment . Similar to HeLa cells , ACTB R183W and E364K 460 showed prominent differences from each other and from the wild - type β - actin ( Figure S3A ) . 461 E364K was again expressed at lower levels than wild - type β - actin and localized in the cytoplasm 462 in a diffuse manner . In contrast , the R183W variant was localized to membrane - proximal regions 463 like wild - type β - actin , but it also formed large cytoplasmic foci ( Figure S3A ) . The difference in 464 ACTB R183W localization between HEK293 and HeLa cells is likely due to cell type differences 465 in actin dynamics and regulation in these cell lines . However , the prominent differences in R183W 466 and E364K localization in both systems strongly suggest distinct functional consequences of 467 these mutations . 468 469 Consistent with our imaging results , the two variants showed clear differences in their proximity 470 interactions ( Figure 5D and Table S1 ) . The ACTB E364K interaction pattern was consistent with 471 a loss - of - function phenotype . This mutant lost proximal interactions with virtually all proteins 472 interacting with wild - type β - actin , but associated more with subunits of the TRiC / CCT chaperonin 473 and prefoldin , which are key chaperones regulating actin folding 69 . This is also consistent with our 474 previous finding that ACTB E364K interacts more than wild - type β - actin with several cellular 475 chaperones 7 . Thus , E364K very likely represents a loss - of - function β - actin variant due to deficient 476 23 folding , which is not readily seen with in vitro assays . Our results also suggest that E364K should 477 be re - classified as a true pathogenic variant . 478 479 ACTB R183W , in contrast , showed a complex pattern of changed proximal interactions . While it 480 interacted with some known actin regulators ( e . g . tropomodulins ) to a similar extent as wild - type 481 β - actin , most proximal interactions were either increased or decreased . For example , the variant 482 associated less with proteins that bind the barbed end of the actin filament , such as capping 483 proteins ( CAP1 and CAP2 ) , formins ( FMNL2 and FMNL3 ) , and WH2 domain proteins ( JMY , 484 WASL ) . On the other hand , it associated more strongly with proteins that associate with the side 485 of filamentous actin and / or promote actin bundling and cross - linking , including alpha - actinin and 486 other proteins with calponin - homology domains , regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase PP1 , 487 and tropomyosin 70 . This interaction pattern suggests that the R183W mutation affects actin 488 dynamics by promoting the association of filament - stabilizing proteins and disrupting interactions 489 with factors promoting polymerization or depolymerization . The prominent differences between 490 E364K and R183W variants in localization and proximity interaction partners likely explain the 491 distinct disease manifestations associated with these mutations . 492 493 Next , we investigated if imaging could provide functional insights into variants identified in cancer 494 genome sequencing studies . Our imaging screen identified a subtle but reproducible phenotype 495 in a mutant variant of the SMAD2 transcription factor , SMAD2 D304G . The mutant variant 496 localized more to the nucleus than wild - type SMAD2 , which was mostly cytoplasmic ( Figure 5E ) . 497 We observed a similarly subtle but reproducible phenotype in U2OS cells , corroborating the 498 original screen results ( Figure 5E ) . 499 500 SMAD2 is a key transcription factor in the TGFβ pathway . Loss - of - function mutations or deletions 501 in SMAD transcription factors and TGF - β receptor genes occur in a significant fraction of 502 24 esophageal , gastric , colorectal , and pancreatic adenocarcinomas 71 . Upon TGFβ pathway 503 stimulation , SMAD2 interacts with SMAD4 , translocates to the nucleus , and activates TGFβ 504 responsive genes . The D304G mutation is located in the C - terminal MH2 domain , which regulates 505 interactions of SMAD2 with other SMADs , transcriptional cofactors and other cellular factors 71 . 506 We therefore investigated if the mutation might disrupt some of these interactions . To this end , 507 we used the LUMIER assay , which has previously been used to study SMAD2 interactions 72 . We 508 co - transfected Nanoluc - tagged reference SMAD2 or D304G with 3xFLAG - tagged SMAD2 509 interaction partners and measured luminescence after anti - FLAG pulldown . Wild - type and mutant 510 SMAD2 interacted equally well with the known SMAD2 interactors TRIM33 , SMURF2 , FOXH1 , 511 and SMAD4 ( Figure 5F ) . However , the D304G mutant had a severely reduced interaction with 512 the transcriptional regulator SKI and a slightly increased interaction with the TGFβ receptor 513 TGFBR1 . Thus , the mutation selectively affects some SMAD2 interactions while having no effect 514 on others . 515 516 To assess the effects of the D304G mutation on SMAD2 activity , we assayed its ability to activate 517 a TGFβ reporter gene 73 . We co - transfected 3xFLAG - tagged wild - type SMAD2 or D304G with the 518 3TP - lux reporter and Nanoluc control plasmid into MDA - 231 cells and measured reporter activity 519 with or without TGFβ stimulation . Wild - type SMAD2 robustly activated the reporter in control 520 conditions , and this was boosted by TGFβ treatment ( Figure 5G ) . In contrast , SMAD2 D304G 521 activated the reporter much less and it did not respond to TGFβ ( Figure 5G ) , indicating that the 522 mutation disrupts SMAD2’s transactivation potential and TGFβ responsiveness . The loss of 523 transactivation capability suggests that the D304G variant is phenotypically a loss - of - function 524 mutation , thereby potentially contributing to tumorigenesis . More generally , these results show 525 that protein localization can be used to prioritize variants of unknown significance for functional 526 studies . 527 528 25 DISCUSSION 529 530 This study represents the first large - scale , publicly available map of the impact of human coding 531 variants on protein localization . Aside from serving as a freely available resource for researchers 532 interested in each variant , reference gene , or associated human disorder , our work answers 533 fundamental questions about the frequency , characteristics , and mechanisms of mislocalization 534 in human disease . . 535 536 Our work firmly establishes that protein mislocalization is a common result of pathogenic 537 missense variation in diverse disease genes . At least one in six pathogenic or likely pathogenic 538 variants are mislocalized , rising to at least one in four for variants in proteins trafficked through 539 the secretory pathway . Thus , mislocalization is nearly as common a molecular phenotype of 540 pathogenic missense variants as loss of protein stability or loss of protein - protein interactions . 541 Moreover , mislocalization is equally involved in variants underlying recessive and dominant 542 diseases , as well as germline and somatic variants , illustrating the central role of aberrant protein 543 trafficking and localization in disease pathogenesis . 544 545 Compartments of mislocalization 546 547 While variant mislocalization affected all subcellular compartments , it was particularly common in 548 the secretory pathway . This is consistent with the compartmentalized nature of protein quality 549 control in the secretory pathway . Mutants that disrupt the folding of proteins trafficked through the 550 secretory pathway are often retained in the ER or Golgi before being targeted for degradation via 551 the proteasome , autophagy , or ER - phagy 40 . Thus , any mutations that interfere with protein folding 552 in the ER or insertion into the membrane will likely lead to mislocalization . Studies with model 553 substrates in yeast and human cells have delineated multiple pathways that regulate protein 554 26 quality control in the secretory pathway . However , although the pathways are well known , it is still 555 poorly understood how individual substrates are recognized by one or another pathway 40 . We 556 believe that the large - scale collection of mislocalized secretory pathway variants will be a valuable 557 resource to more comprehensively characterize these pathways in a disease - relevant setting . 558 559 We also observed that 1 . 5 % of all tested variants ( corresponding to 14 % of all mislocalized 560 variants ) formed distinct punctate structures compared to the reference protein . These included 561 known aggregating variants in lens crystallins and cytoskeletal keratins as well as variants known 562 to regulate protein partitioning to biomolecular condensates . Importantly , variants affecting 563 punctate structures were significantly enriched for those that are predicted to modulate 564 condensation properties of proteins and for autosomal dominant inheritance pattern . These 565 independent lines of evidence suggest that many of the newly discovered variants could be 566 pathogenic due to their propensity to interfere with biomolecular condensates in a gain - of - function 567 or dominant negative manner . We suggest that such focus - forming variants in our study be 568 prioritized for further studies to characterize their mechanism of action in molecular detail . Of note , 569 although the absolute frequency of focus - forming variants was relatively low , the highly charged 570 3xFLAG - V5 tag used in our study may interfere with condensate formation . It is known that 571 different tags can have distinct effects on the phase separation behavior of tagged proteins 74 . 572 Assessing localization patterns with alternative tags such as fluorescent proteins could reveal 573 more variants with altered condensate behavior . 574 575 Causes of mislocalization 576 577 Our study suggests that , overall , protein mislocalization is caused more often by mutations 578 disrupting protein stability and folding rather than mutations in specific motifs that regulate protein 579 trafficking or those that interfere with specific protein - protein interactions . This notion was 580 27 supported by the tendency of mislocalized variants to interact more with cellular quality control 581 factors than normally localized variants , and by the enrichment of mutations in transmembrane 582 domains in mislocalized variants . While there are many exceptions , the trend is consistent with 583 the available target space for mutations . Most proteins have many more residues that contribute 584 to protein stability than those that regulate specific protein - protein interactions involved in 585 trafficking . Our findings also highlight the interconnectivity of molecular phenotypes of disease 586 variants . Missense variants often impinge on multiple facets of protein homeostasis . For example , 587 loss of stability can cause mislocalization , which in turn can affect protein - protein interactions by 588 limiting access to interacting partners . On the other hand , loss of specific interactions can lead to 589 protein instability . Characterizing pathogenic variants with multiple complementary assays can 590 help understand how these processes are connected and provide a means to uncover the root 591 cause of pathogenesis at the molecular level . 592 593 Complementary strategies for variant phenotyping 594 595 Our approach to study a few variants but across more than a thousand different genes is highly 596 complementary to deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) studies . DMS has emerged as a powerful 597 method to systematically characterize the effects of all missense variants on a single protein at a 598 time 1 . However , many DMS studies have employed readouts that are specific to each protein’s 599 function , limiting assay transferability and scalability . On the other hand , “wide mutational 600 scanning” ( WMS ) provides a phenotypic survey of variants across a wide swath of proteins . 601 Although not all genes or variants are amenable to WMS based on protein localization , combining 602 multiple scalable assays for common phenotypes of pathogenic variants can significantly increase 603 the coverage 75 . Indeed , if our localization results are combined with our previous study for variant 604 stability and protein - protein interactions with the same variant collection 7 , 66 % of the genes had 605 at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant with a phenotype in at least one assay . Thus , 606 28 a relatively limited set of scalable assays for common molecular phenotypes can cover a large 607 fraction of all genes . 608 609 Imaging presents several avenues to further increase the sensitivity and throughput of variant 610 phenotyping . We have shown that cell morphological profiling ( “Cell Painting” ) can predict the 611 impact of coding variants on protein function and distinguish between gain - of - function , change - 612 of - function , and loss - of - function variants of diverse genes 76 , 77 . Integrating Cell Painting with 613 variant localization in the future could provide an exceptionally sensitive and information - rich 614 platform for variant phenotyping , although more replicates per sample would likely be needed to 615 capture the often - subtle morphological effects of Cell Painting , compared to effects on protein 616 localization . At the same time , moving from arrayed libraries to pooled optical screens enabled 617 by barcoding and in situ sequencing 78 , 79 could dramatically increase the throughput of variant 618 profiling by imaging . Further improvements in large - scale mutagenesis in human cells and 619 decreases in the cost of DNA synthesis could make it realistic to phenotypically profile all 620 ~ 200 , 000 pathogenic missense coding variants reported in ClinVar , providing an unprecedented 621 resource of variant phenotypes across thousands of rare diseases . 622 623 Mislocalization as a phenotype for drug discovery 624 625 The mislocalization phenotypes discovered in our study could serve as starting points for chemical 626 screens for correctors of trafficking defects . Notably , correctors and potentiators of mutant CFTR 627 trafficking , which are now in clinical use , were originally identified in phenotypic screens in cell 628 culture models with ectopically expressed constructs 80 , 81 . It is highly likely that many other 629 pathogenic variants could be similarly corrected with small molecules . These could directly bind 630 mutant proteins akin to the CFTR correctors or target key nodes regulating protein trafficking . The 631 latter possibility is particularly attractive , as mislocalized variants are significantly enriched in 632 29 membrane proteins and secreted proteins . This raises the tantalizing possibility that similar 633 therapeutics might be identified that could mitigate an entire class of mislocalizations and , 634 therefore , potentially an entire class of disorders . For example , pharmacological manipulation of 635 the unfolded protein response can promote trafficking of some loss - of - function variants and 636 prevent protein aggregation in the secretory pathway 82 – 85 . However , the vast majority of 637 mislocalized disease variants remain to be tested for pharmacological rescue . Our 638 comprehensive resource of pathogenic mislocalized variants could act as a scalable platform for 639 the characterization of pharmacological chaperones across hundreds of phenotypes and 640 diseases , providing a springboard for the discovery of novel therapeutics for rare disorders . 641 642 30 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 643 We would like to thank other members of the Taipale and Carpenter – Singh labs for their help 644 during the project and for comments on the manuscript .

MDA - 231 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium 693 ( Gibco ) supplemented with 5 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Cells were dissociated with 694 trypsin and all cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were regularly monitored for 695 mycoplasma infection . HeLa Kyoto cells , HEK293T , and HEK293 Flp - In TREx cells were 696 33 authenticated with STR profiling ( GenePrint 24 System , Promega ) at The Centre for Applied 697 Genomics , The Hospital for Sick Children , Toronto . 698 HeLa Kyoto , U2OS , and RPE1 cells used in this study were a gift from the Pelletier laboratory 699 ( Mount Sinai , Toronto , Canada ) . MDA - 231 cells were a gift from the Attisano laboratory . 700 701 METHOD DETAILS 702 703 Plasmids 704 We used the previously described hmORFome 1 . 1 and common variant collection 7 , a collection 705 of kinase mutant variants 27 , and the Target Accelerator Pan - Cancer Mutant Collection ( Addgene 706 Kit # 1000000103 ) 29 . 707 708 Entry clones were transferred using Gateway technology into a mammalian expression 709 pcDNA3 . 1 plasmid containing an N - terminal 3xFLAG - V5 tag ( Addgene 87064 ) for the Target 710 Accelerator Pan - Cancer Mutant Collection , or a pcDNA3 . 1 - based plasmid containing a C - 711 terminal 3xFLAG - V5 tag ( Addgene 87063 ) for all other variants . Inserts were verified by 712 restriction digestion and clones that did not produce the expected digestion pattern were omitted 713 from further analysis . 714 715 Transfection and Immunofluorescence 716 Cells were seeded on CellCarrier - 96 well black , optically clear bottom plates ( Perkin Elmer ) at a 717 density of 5 , 000 cells / well and incubated overnight to attach . Plasmids were transfected into HeLa 718 Kyoto cells with X - tremeGENE 9™ ( MilliporeSigma ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Two 719 days post - transfection , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in culture medium for 20 min 720 at room temperature , followed by three washes in 1xPBS . Cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % 721 34 Triton X - 100 / 1xPBS for 10 min and blocked with 1 % BSA / 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / 1xPBS for 45 min . 722 Cells were incubated with anti - FLAG M2 antibody ( 1 : 500 , Sigma - Aldrich ) diluted in blocking buffer 723 for 1 h at room temperature . Subsequently , cells were washed in 1 x PBS then incubated with 724 Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - mouse ( 1 : 500 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , Hoechst 33342 ( 1 : 5000 , 725 Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , Concanavalin A , Alexa Fluor™ 647 Conjugate ( 1 : 250 , Thermo Fisher 726 Scientific ) and MitoTracker™ Red CM - H2Xros ( 100 nM , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) diluted in 727 blocking buffer for 1 hour . For phalloidin staining of actin filaments , cells were incubated in Alexa 728 Fluor™ 568 Phalloidin ( 1 : 400 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 hour . 729 730 Image acquisition 731 For quantitative imaging of stained cells , images were acquired using the Opera Phenix™ 732 screening system ( PerkinElmer ) using a 63x / 1 . 15 NA water immersion objective in confocal 733 mode . In every experiment twenty - five fields were acquired per well , capturing four fluorescence 734 channels each with Harmony™ high - content imaging software ( PerkinElmer ) . 735 736 Image analysis 737 Using CellProfiler 31 software , images were corrected for illumination variation across the field of 738 view , individual cells were segmented , and 1 , 313 morphological features were measured for each 739 cell across four imaging channels . Then untransfected cells were filtered out based on the mean 740 intensity of the 488 fluorescence channel ( FLAG tag ) . Replicate - level ( equivalent to well - level ) 741 profiles were formed by aggregation ( population - average ) of all transfected imaged single cells in 742 each sample well . Features with near zero variance were removed and replicate - level profiles 743 were standardized per plate to have zero mean and unit variance . The similarity between two 744 profiles is measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient ( CC ) and is used to assess technical 745 replicate reproducibility of the perturbations with more than one technical replicate . 746 35 747 The Impact Score ( IS ) for each wild - type / mutant pair is then defined as the ( 1 - CC ) / 2 in which CC 748 is the correlation coefficient between the wild - type and the mutant replicate - level profiles on each 749 same plate . Impact scores were calculated for each wild - type / mutant pair at three levels of feature 750 categories : features relating to the tagged protein channel ( n = 340 ) , all other channels ( n = 953 ) , 751 and all four channels ( n = 1293 ) combined . An impact score of 0 for a wild - type / mutant pair 752 indicates perfect similarity between the pair , whereas an impact score of 1 indicates that the 753 profiles show opposite patterns . The full data processing and analysis pipeline and workflow is 754 publicly available at : https : / / github . com / carpenter - singh - lab / 2023 _ LacosteHaghighi _ submitted 755 756 Feature analysis 757 Features of variants were extracted from HGMD , PolyPhen - 2 , AlphaFold Database , and ClinVar 758 26 , 30 , 31 , 86 . Post - translational modifications ( PTMs ) were extracted from ActiveDriver , PhosphoSite 759 Plus , and UniProt 87 , 88 . 760 761 Stable cell line production for mass spectrometry 762 Entry clones were from the collections previously described in Plasmids . Entry clones were 763 transferred using Gateway technology to Flp - In T - REx compatible vector pDEST - pcDNA5 - BirA * - 764 FLAG , to express the BirA * at the C - terminus of the bait 89 . All inserts were verified using Sanger 765 sequencing . The resulting constructs were integrated into HEK293 Flp - In T - REx cells using the 766 Flp - In technology ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . HEK293 Flp - In T - REx were seeded in 6 - well plates 767 and co - transfected the following day with 200 ng bait - BirA * - FLAG construct and 2 μg pOG44 768 ( Invitrogen ) with Lipofectamine 2000 , as per the manufacturer’s ( Invitrogen ) protocol . 24 hours 769 later , cells were expanded to a 10 - cm dish . Polyclonal cell populations were then selected for 12 - 770 15 days with 200 μg / ml hygromycin B . Expression of constructs and biotinylation activity was 771 validated by Western blotting . 772 36 Sample preparation for BioID 773 Sample preparation and processing was performed in two biological replicates . Cells were grown 774 in 150 mm dishes to roughly 70 % confluence , and then gene expression was induced with 1 µg / ml 775 tetracycline . 12 hours later , 50 mM biotin was added to each plate and incubated for another 12 776 hours . Cells were washed once using 1 x PBS , scraped , pelleted , flash - frozen and kept at 80°C 777 until processing . 778 779 Sample processing began with resuspension of cell pellets in ice - cold modified RIPA buffer ( 50 780 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % NP40 , 0 . 1 % 781 SDS , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate ) containing protease inhibitors ( 1 mM PMSF , 1 : 500 protease 782 inhibitor cocktail from Sigma - Aldrich , P8340 ) at a 1 : 8 pellet weight ( g ) to lysis buffer volume ( ml ) 783 ratio . Lysates were sonicated ( 3 x 5 - second bursts with 3 seconds rest in between at 33 % 784 amplitude ) . 1 μL of RNase A ( Sigma - Aldrich , R6148 ) and 1 μL TurboNuclease ( BioVision , 9207 ) 785 were added to each sample , followed by incubation on a nutator / rocker for 20 minutes at 4°C . To 786 further solubilize membranes , appropriate volumes of 10 % SDS were added into each sample to 787 bring the SDS concentration up to 0 . 25 % . After 5 minutes of mixing at 4°C , samples were 788 centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C . After centrifugation , equal amounts of 789 supernatant from each sample were mixed with 30 μl of pre - washed streptavidin - sepharose 790 beads ( GE Healthcare , 17 - 5113 - 01 ) and incubated for 3 hours at 4°C on a nutator . Following 791 affinity purification of biotinylated proteins , the supernatant was discarded , and beads were 792 washed once with modified RIPA buffer containing inhibitors , once with 2 % SDS wash buffer ( 25 793 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 2 % SDS ) , once with RIPA wash buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM 794 NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % NP40 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate ) , and finally once with 795 TENN - wash buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % NP40 ) . Following 796 those washes , the beads were washed three times with ABC buffer ( 50 mM ammonium 797 bicarbonate pH 8 in mass spectrometry grade H 2 O ) . Streptavidin - sepharose beads were then 798 37 resuspended in 50 μl of ABC buffer , and 1 μg trypsin ( Sigma - Aldrich , T6567 ) was added to the 799 samples . The samples were incubated overnight at 37°C , followed by addition of 0 . 5 μg of trypsin 800 for 4 hours at 37°C . After trypsin digestion , the beads were pelleted , and the supernatant was 801 recovered into a fresh 1 . 5 ml microfuge tube . The beads were rinsed twice in 80 μl of HPLC - grade 802 H 2 O , and the rinses were pooled with the original supernatant . The pooled supernatants were 803 centrifuged at 16 , 100 x g for 2 minutes , and all but the bottom 15 - 20 µl was transferred to a fresh 804 1 . 5 mL microfuge tube . The samples were dried with a centrifugal evaporator and stored at - 80°C 805 until further processing . 806 807 Mass spectrometry data acquisition 808 Fused silica ( 0 . 75 μm ID , 350 μm OD ) capillary columns were pulled with a laser puller and 809 packed in - house with 10 – 12 cm C18 ( Reprosil - Pur 120 C18 - AQ , 3 μm , Dr . Maisch HPLC 810 GmbH ) in methanol . Columns were equilibrated in buffer A ( 0 . 1 % formic acid in 2 % acetonitrile ) 811 before sample loading . 812 A quarter of each BioID sample was analyzed using the TripleTOF 5600 ( AB Sciex ) in Data - 813 Dependent Acquisition ( DDA ) mode . Briefly , 5 μL of digested peptides were loaded at 400 814 nL / min onto a previously equilibrated HPLC column . The peptides were eluted from the column 815 over a 90 - minute gradient using a NanoLC - Ultra 1D plus ( Eksigent , Dublin CA ) nano - pump and 816 subsequently analyzed using a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer ( AB SCIEX , Concord , 817 Ontario , Canada ) . The gradient was delivered at 200 nL / min , initiating from 2 % acetonitrile with 818 0 . 1 % formic acid to 35 % acetonitrile with 0 . 1 % formic acid over 90 minutes , followed by a 15 - 819 minute wash using 80 % acetonitrile with 0 . 1 % formic acid , and a 15 - minute equilibration period 820 to 2 % acetonitrile with 0 . 1 % formic acid . Instrument performance was monitored daily using a 821 system suitability test data consisting of a 30 - minute gradient injection of 30fm BSA and 60fm of 822 38 casein protein digest ( both standards were trypsin digested in - house from commercial protein 823 stocks ( Sigma ) ) that was run before each sample . Performance monitoring consisted of tracking 824 Peak intensities , mass accuracies , and retention times to ensure LCMS data quality was 825 consistent throughout the project . The mass accuracy of the 5600 instrument was calibrated 826 before each sample analysis using an automated routine . 827 The instrument method used in DDA mode consisted of one 250 ms MS1 TOF survey scan 828 from 400 - 1250 Da followed by isolation of the top 20 MS2 candidate ions for 100 ms per ion . 829 Only ions charged 2 + to 4 + exceeding a threshold of 250 cps were considered for MS2 , and 830 former precursors were excluded for 15 s following isolation . 831 832 Mass spectrometry data analysis 833 AB SCIEX WIFF MS files were first converted to mzXML using Proteowizard 90 implemented in 834 ProHits v4 . 0 91 . mzML and mzXML files were searched using Mascot ( version 2 . 3 . 02 ) and Comet 835 version 2012 . 02rev . 0 92 against the NCBI RefSeq database ( version 57 , January 30 , 2013 ) 836 containing a total of 72 , 482 human and adenovirus sequences supplemented with common 837 contaminants from the Max Planck Institute 838 ( http : / / lotus1 . gwdg . de / mpg / mmbc / maxquant _ input . nsf / 7994124a4298328fc125748d0048fee2 / $ 839 FILE / contaminants . fasta ) and the Global Proteome Machine ( GPM ; 840 https : / / www . thegpm . org / crap / index . html ) . The database parameters were set to search for 841 tryptic cleavages , permitting up to two missed cleavage sites per peptide with a mass tolerance 842 of 35 ppm for precursors with charges + 2 to + 4 and a tolerance of ± 0 . 15 amu for fragment ions . 843 Asparagine or glutamine deamination and methionine oxidation were allowed as variable 844 39 modifications . The results from each search engine were subsequently analyzed through the 845 Trans - Proteomic Pipeline ( version 4 . 6 Occupy rev 3 ) using the iProphet pipeline 93 . 846 847 Significance analysis of INTeractome ( SAINT ) analysis 848 SAINTexpress ( version 3 . 6 . 1 ) 94 was used as a statistical tool to filter out likely contaminants . 849 Briefly : all protein entries identified with ≥ 2 unique peptides and iProphet score ≥0 . 95 were used 850 for SAINTexpress analysis , and biological duplicates were used for each bait . Negative controls 851 [ fusions of BirA ∗ - FLAG to EGFP or Nanoluciferase or untransfected HEK293 cells ; 10 controls in 852 total – Table S1 , sheet B : Controls ] were compressed to 5 virtual controls to maximize stringency 853 in scoring , as previously described 95 . SAINTexpress analysis was performed using the default 854 parameters , and only those entries passing a calculated Bayesian FDR ( BFDR ) ≤ 1 % were 855 considered high - confidence . 856 Luminescence assays for SMAD2 characterization 857 For 3TP - lux reporter assays , MDA231 cells were seeded into clear 96 - well plates at 15 , 000 cells 858 per well in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with 5 % FBS growth medium . The following 859 day , each well was transfected with 100 ng of 3TP - lux ( Attisano Lab ) , 50 ng 3xFLAG - tagged ORF , 860 and 5 ng Nanoluciferase with X - tremeGENE 9™ ( MilliporeSigma ) following the manufacturer’s 861 protocol . The next day , the media was removed , and cells were starved with RPMI supplemented 862 with 0 . 2 % FBS for 8 hours . Then , the media was removed and replaced with 100 µl of 0 . 2 % serum 863 media + / - 100 pM TGFβ ( a kind gift from the Attisano lab , University of Toronto ) . After an overnight 864 incubation ( 16 hours ) , cells were washed with 1 x PBS , lysed with 80 µl / well HENG buffer ( 20 mM 865 HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 9 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 20 mM Na 2 MoO 4 , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 866 40 5 % glycerol ) containing protease inhibitors ( 1 μg / mL aprotinin , 1 μg / mL leupeptin , 1 μg / mL 867 pepstatin , 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) and incubated on a shaker at 4°C . After 20 minutes of incubation , 20 868 µl of the sample and 20 µl of Firefly Luciferase Lysis Buffer ( 150 mM Tris - HCL pH 8 . 0 , 75 mM 869 NaCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 , 15 mM DTT , 0 . 6 mM Coenzyme A , 0 . 45 mM ATP pH 870 7 . 0 , 250 µg / mL D - luciferin ) was added to a 96 - well white opaque plate . Firefly signal was 871 measured using a BioTek Synergy Neo microplate reader after the plate was incubated at room 872 temperature for 10 minutes . Then , 20 µl of Firefly Stop & Glo Buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCL pH 7 . 5 , 150 873 mM KCl , 45 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 % Tergitol NP9 , 60 µM PTC124 , 50 mM Thioacetamide , 5 µM 874 Fuzimarine ) was added to the 96 - well plate , incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature , and 875 Nanoluciferase signal was read . 876 For the LUMIER assay , 293T cells were seeded into clear 96 - well plates at 30 , 000 cells 877 per well in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS . The following day , each well was transfected 878 with 75 ng of 3xFLAG - tagged ORF ( prey ) and 75 ng of either Nanoluc - SMAD2 WT or Nanoluc - 879 SMAD2 - D304G in a mixture with 0 . 6 µL polyethylenimine ( PEI ) and 50 µL OptiMEM . After two 880 days , cells were treated with 5 pM TGFβ for 5 minutes then cells were washed with 1xPBS , and 881 then lysed with ice - cold HENG buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 150 mM NaCl , 2mM EDTA pH 8 , 882 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 5 % glycerol ) containing protease inhibitors ( 1 µg / ml aprotinin , 1 µg / ml 883 leupeptin , 1µg / ml pepstatin , 0 . 2 mM PMSF ) . The lysates were then transferred from the 96 - well 884 plates into opaque white 384 - well plates that were pre - coated with monoclonal anti - FLAG M2 885 antibody ( Millipore Sigma , F1804 ) . Plates were blocked with 1 % BSA / 5 % sucrose / 0 . 5 % Tween 886 20 / 1xPBS . The 384 - well plates were incubated for 3 hours at 4°C with mild shaking and then 887 washed with HENG buffer ( without protease inhibitors ) using an automated plate washer . 888 Luminescence was measured with a BioTek Synergy Neo microplate reader five minutes after 889 adding furimazine luciferase reagent dissolved 1 : 200 in luciferase buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 890 1 mM EDTA , 150 mM KCl , 0 . 5 % Tergitol NP9 ) . Afterwards , HRP - conjugated anti - FLAG antibody 891 ( 1 : 10 , 000 , Millipore Sigma , A8592 ) diluted in ELISA buffer ( 1xPBS , 1 % goat serum , 1 % Tween 892 41 20 ) was added to wells and plates were incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature with mild 893 shaking . Plates were then washed with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 / 1xPBS using an automated plate washer . 894 ELISA signal was measured using a BioTek Synergy Neo microplate reader one minute after 895 adding SuperSignal ELISA Pico Chemiluminescent substrate ( ThermoFisher Scientific , 37069 ) . 896 897 Quantification and statistical analysis 898 Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism .
