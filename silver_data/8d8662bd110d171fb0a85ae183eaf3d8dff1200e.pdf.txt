REVIEW Open Access Computational approaches to protein inference in shotgun proteomics Yong Fuga Li , Predrag Radivojac * Abstract Shotgun proteomics has recently emerged as a powerful approach to characterizing proteomes in biological samples . Its overall objective is to identify the form and quantity of each protein in a high - throughput manner by coupling liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry . As a consequence of its high throughput nature , shotgun proteomics faces challenges with respect to the analysis and interpretation of experimental data . Among such challenges , the identification of proteins present in a sample has been recognized as an important computational task . This task generally consists of ( 1 ) assigning experimental tandem mass spectra to peptides derived from a protein database , and ( 2 ) mapping assigned peptides to proteins and quantifying the confidence of identified proteins . Protein identification is fundamentally a statistical inference problem with a number of methods proposed to address its challenges . In this review we categorize current approaches into rule - based , combinatorial optimization and probabilistic inference techniques , and present them using integer programing and Bayesian inference frameworks . We also discuss the main challenges of protein identification and propose potential solutions with the goal of spurring innovative research in this area . Introduction The main objective of mass spectrometry - based proteo - mics is to provide a molecular snapshot of the form ( e . g . splice isoforms , post - translational modifications ) , abun - dance level , and functional aspects ( e . g . protein - protein interactions , protein localization ) of each protein in a biological sample [ 1 - 3 ] . Among proteomics strategies , bottom - up or shotgun proteomics has emerged as a high - throughput technology capable of characterizing hundreds of proteins at the same time . In this scenario , proteins in a sample are first digested into peptides , typi - cally using site - specific proteolytic enzymes ( e . g . trypsin ) . Peptides are then separated by liquid chromatography ( LC ) and analyzed by tandem mass - spectrometry ( MS / MS ) resulting in a set of MS / MS spectra [ 4 ] . In contrast to the top - down proteomics strategy , where intact pro - teins are directly analyzed through mass spectrometers , shotgun proteomics is characterized by high separation efficiency and mass spectral sensitivity . At the same time , it places higher demands on the computational and sta - tistical techniques necessary for peptide identification , protein identification , and label - free quantification . In a standard computational pipeline , MS / MS spectra from a mass spectrometer are searched against spectral libraries [ 5 - 8 ] and / or in silico spectra [ 9 - 14 ] corresponding to peptides from a protein database in order to provide peptide - spectrum matches ( PSMs ) . Such a database search , depending on the parameters of the search and the MS / MS platform , can result in a large number of PSMs that are assigned scores indicating the confidence level of cor - rect identification of the respective peptide . The next step is to assemble a list of identified proteins from all , or a subset of , PSMs and provide statistical confidence levels for each protein . Protein identification is a special case of label - free pro - tein quantification because , in an ideal scenario , each protein with a correctly inferred non - zero quantity ( abundance ) would be considered identified . However , label - free quantification has not yet reached the accuracy needed for the wide dynamic range of quantities observed in cellular or extracellular proteomes [ 15 ] . In addition , in many practical situations it suffices to only consider the existence of proteins in the sample and not their exact quantity . Thus , solving the more general and significantly more difficult problem of quantification to provide a solution to its subproblem may result in less accurate solutions to protein identification . * Correspondence : predrag @ indiana . edu School of Informatics and Computing , Indiana University , Bloomington 150 S .

Obtaining a list of identified proteins from a set of pep - tide sequences with identification scores may seem straightforward . However , there are several factors that combine to challenge such intuition : ( 1 ) Usually only a small number of peptide identifications , mostly unreli - able , are available for each protein [ 16 ] . This is because only the top - scoring PSMs for each peptide are typically included into the candidate set for peptide identifications , and among those candidates only a small subset are con - sidered to be confident identifications . This leads to diffi - culties in providing confident protein identifications , e . g . if only a single peptide is identified from a protein . ( 2 ) Peptides , even those from the same protein , are not equally likely to be identified in a proteomics experiment [ 17 - 19 ] . The probability that a peptide is identified in a standard proteomics experiment has been referred to as peptide detectability [ 19 ] , see appendix . ( 3 ) Many peptide sequences encountered in a typical proteomics workflow can be mapped to more than one protein in a database . These are referred to as degenerate or shared peptides [ 20 , 21 ] . It is a common situation that a eukaryotic sample contains more degenerate than unique peptides , i . e . pep - tides that can be mapped to only one protein . ( 4 ) It is non - trivial to estimate the false discovery rates ( FDRs ) of identified peptides and proteins . Some approaches to estimating peptide - level FDRs involve construction of decoy databases or use unsupervised estimation of class - conditional distributions ( distributions of PSM scores given correct and false identifications , respectively ) . How - ever , a large number of low - scoring PSMs may create dif - ficulties in determining the certainty of both peptide and protein identification . While methods for the estimation of peptide - level FDRs have been characterized relatively well computing protein - level FDRs remains an open problem [ 22 , 23 ] . The process of identifying proteins that are present in a biological sample is now widely framed as a statistical inference problem , and has been referred to as the protein inference problem [ 20 , 21 ] . To date , a number of approaches have been proposed to address this problem [ 20 , 35 - 37 ] . We categorize those approaches into three broad groups , noting that a particular method may exploit more than one strategy : 1 . Rule - based strategies - methods that rely on a relatively small set of confidently identified ( unique ) peptides that are subsequently assigned to proteins . 2 . Combinatorial optimization algorithms - methods that rely on constrained optimization formulations of the protein inference problem resulting , for example , in minimal protein lists that cover some or all confi - dently identified peptides . 3 . Probabilistic inference algorithms - methods that formulate the problem probabilistically and assign identification probabilities for each protein in a database . In the following sections , we provide justification for the development of advanced protein inference algo - rithms and then review the major computational strate - gies . All combinatorial optimization techniques are presented using a framework of integer programming ; on the other hand , probabilistic algorithms are summarized using Bayesian inference principles . Our focus is also on the intuition behind the algorithms , the types of solutions generated , and the strengths and limitations of each method . We believe this information is essential in order to understand commonalities among the algorithms as well as their principal differences . It is also important for the proper interpretation of outputs from the various protein inference tools already applied in bottom - up proteomics . Notation Before discussing algorithmic details , it is important to introduce notation that will be used throughout this paper . Let us consider a set of tandem mass spectra S from a proteomics experiment and let be a database of proteins that the spectra are searched against . Let also be the set of all pep - tides in the database and , similarly , be the set of pep - tides that belong to protein P i . We now define two sets of indicator variables as follows t j = (cid:2) 1 0 if peptide p j is conﬁdently identiﬁed otherwise and x j = (cid:2) 1 0 if peptide p j is present in the sample otherwise Confident peptide identifications can be determined in several ways , typically by using strict FDR thresholds on the top - scoring PSMs ( per peptide ) and are estimated using a decoy database [ 22 ] or tools such as PeptidePro - phet [ 38 ] , which calculate the posterior probability of a correct peptide identification . When posterior probabil - ities are available , stringent thresholds ( e . g . 0 . 90 ) can be applied directly to those probabilities . Alternatively , suffi - ciently high scores from various search engines [ 9 , 39 - 42 ] are sometimes used to select confident identifications . It is important to mention that variables t i and x i are different . For example , a peptide p j that is confidently identified , e . g . using an FDR threshold of 0 . 01 , will result in setting t j = 1 . On the other hand , x i can be seen as a hidden variable that is to be inferred . Accordingly , P ( x j = 1 | S ) refers to the probability that peptide j is present in the sample given all the data from the mass Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 2 of 19 spectrometer . A set of confidently identified peptides , using any of the above - mentioned approaches will be denoted as . In some situations it will be necessary to consider peptides with explicit designations of their parent pro - teins . In those cases , the j - th peptide derived from pro - tein P i will be denoted as p ij . Two or more such peptides will be allowed to have identical amino acid sequences . For example , peptides p ij and p kl ( i ≠ k ) with identical amino acid sequences will be referred to as degenerate peptides . In the context of protein inference , peptides that occur multiple times only within a single protein will not be considered degenerate . Finally , we define y i = (cid:2) 1 0 if protein P i is present in the sample otherwise Variable y i can be seen as an equivalent of x i at the protein level . Thus , is the posterior probabil - ity that protein P i is present in the sample . The sum - mary of notation and abbreviations is shown in Table 1 . Protein inference : significance and algorithms Our first goal is to investigate the influence of degener - ate peptides and to show that their presence is often a major factor contributing to the challenges in protein inference . We analyze several cellular and serum sam - ples and characterize the peptide identification process . The data include cell line and plasma samples from Homo sapiens [ 16 ] , a tissue sample from Mus musculus [ 43 ] , as well as samples from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 44 ] and Deinococcus radiodurans [ 24 ] . The sets of spec - tra were searched using MASCOT [ 39 ] against the human IPI database ( v3 . 35 ) , mouse IPI database ( v3 . 35 ) , Saccharomyces Genome Database ( R63 , 05 - Jan - 2010 ) , and D . radiodurans proteins extracted from GenBank ( 27 - Aug - 2009 ) , respectively . Figure 1A shows the percentage of identified peptides per protein for an FDR of 0 . 01 ( on the unique peptide level ) when using a reversed database as decoy . We observe that 32 - 63 % of proteins are covered by only one confidently identified peptide , while 5 - 36 % of proteins are covered by five peptides or more . Figure 1B shows the percentage of degenerate peptides in each sample . The results indicate that 57 - 68 % of peptides in human and mouse samples are degenerate , regardless of the type of biological sample ( e . g . cell line vs . tissue vs . plasma ) . On the other hand , the yeast and D . radiodur - ans data sets contain only 18 % and 1 % of degenerate peptides , respectively . Figure 1C provides the percentage of candidate proteins hit by unique peptides . In mouse and human samples more than 80 % of candidate pro - teins are identified only with degenerate peptides . This percentage decreases to 23 % for yeast and 3 % for D . radiodurans . Finally , in Figure 1D we provide the per - centage of protein groups of a particular size , where a group is formed from the set of proteins that are hit by exactly the same peptides . In accordance with previous results , most of the yeast and D . radiodurans candidate proteins are distinguishable ; however , for human and mouse samples , between 30 % and 50 % of protein groups contain multiple proteins . This analysis provides evidence that protein inference is a non - trivial problem , especially for multicellular eukaryotes that are known to contain large numbers of paralogous proteins . It also emphasizes the importance of developing sophisticated protein inference algorithms . Rule - based approaches With a typical LC - MS / MS experiment resulting in a potentially large number of protein identifications , con - cerns were raised regarding the impact of misidentified proteins on biomedical science [ 45 ] . In response to this , several guidelines were proposed regarding the standards for publishing proteomics results [ 46 - 49 ] . The so - called “ two - peptide rule ” or two - hit rule , requiring two or more confidently identified peptides to define a confident pro - tein identification , was advocated [ 46 , 48 ] . The same guidelines also recommended the parsimony principle ( see next Section ) as an explanation for the confident peptide identifications , and suggested that “ protein family ” - proteins with similar sequences due to single amino acid variants , homologs , splicing variants , or anno - tation mistakes - should be reported as one group if the proteins share the same identified peptides . There is a good rationale for using the two - peptide rule . In principle , one correct unique peptide should be sufficient to correctly identify a protein . However , even for the low FDR associated with a set of peptides , many individual peptides in a large data set are incorrectly identified . Furthermore , proteins identified by single pep - tide hits are more likely to be incorrectly identified than proteins with higher peptide coverage [ 45 ] . It was reported that FDRs for single - hit proteins can be over 10 times higher than FDRs at the PSM level [ 50 ] , likely due to the clustering of correct peptide identifications to the correct proteins and the lack of clustering behavior for the incorrect peptides [ 50 , 51 ] . However , the two - peptide rule has been challenged [ 51 , 52 ] . First , while including single - hit proteins without stringent quality control can compromise specificity , ignoring such proteins will certainly compromise sensi - tivity [ 52 ] . Second , controlling the confidence ( FDR ) at the peptide level and then deducing the proteins using heuristic rules leads to undefined FDRs at the protein level [ 27 , 50 - 52 ] . On the other hand , controlling FDR directly at the protein level may rescue some of the con - fident single - hit proteins . Indeed , Gupta and Pevnzer Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 3 of 19 demonstrated that using the “ single - peptide rule ” results in 10 - 40 % more protein identifications compared with the two - peptide rule at a fixed FDR level [ 52 ] . The sin - gle - peptide rule simply uses the highest scoring peptide from a protein as a score for that protein , and then directly estimates FDR at the protein level ( rather than at the peptide level ) using decoy databases . Thus , any protein that has one or more peptides with a score above a certain threshold is deemed confident . This statement seems problematic because proteins hit by single peptides should not be reliable . However , two mediocre peptides are not necessarily better than one good peptide ; thus , many proteins hit by a single peptide can be rescued with more stringent score thresholds . Since a significant portion of such proteins are correct [ 53 ] , it is not surprising that the single - peptide rule leads to more protein identifications . With the help of protein - level FDR estimation ( using a decoy database ) , better and more complex rules may be devised to achieve even higher sensitivity . For example , Weatherly et al . proposed setting separate score thresh - olds for proteins with different number of confident peptide identifications [ 51 ] . They reported that gradually lower score thresholds were needed for proteins with increasingly higher coverage . For the coverage of 1 ( i . e . proteins hit by single peptides ) , a MASCOT score of 44 was required , while for coverage of 6 , a MASCOT score as low as 11 was necessary for the same FDR [ 51 ] .

Combinatorial optimization algorithms The input to this class of algorithms typically consists of a set of confidently identified peptides = (cid:3) p j | t j = 1 (cid:4) and a protein database . The objective is to provide a list of proteins that optimizes certain criteria . In one way or another , all such formulations result in NP - hard problems and are usually solved using approximation algorithms . The minimum set cover formulation Minimum set cover ( MSC ) problem : Given a set of confident peptide identifications and protein database , find a smallest protein list L ⊆ such that each pep - tide from is assigned to at least one protein from L . More formally , Figure 1 Summary of peptide identification results over five data sets using a false discovery rate of 0 . 01 and a reversed database . ( A ) Percentage of identified peptides per protein in each sample ; ( B ) percentage of degenerate peptides in each sample ; ( C ) Percentage of all proteins hit by at least one unique peptide , calculated as the number of proteins with at least one unique peptide divided by the number of all proteins hit by at least one peptide ; ( D ) Percentage of protein groups of a particular size , where groups consist of proteins identified by the same set of peptides . The number of identified peptides and proteins in each sample were as follows : ( 3006 , 1898 ) in human cell line ; ( 700 , 390 ) in human plasma ; ( 5062 , 4331 ) in mouse liver ; ( 4012 , 1154 ) in yeast ; and ( 969 , 368 ) in D . radiodurans . Peptide identifications correspond to charges + 1 , + 2 , and + 3 , combined . Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 5 of 19 This protein inference formulation is identical to the classical computer science problem of minimum set cover , where given a set of elements ( peptides ) U and a set of subsets ( proteins ) over U , the goal is to find a smallest ( not necessarily unique ) set of subsets that con - tain all elements in U . It is convenient to visualize the MSC formulation using bipartite graphs ( Figure 2A ) . Using graph representation , it is relatively easy to see that an optimal solution to the MSC problem can also be provided if the original graph is divided into con - nected components and an optimal MSC solution pro - vided separately for each component . The MSC approach has been implemented in the IDPicker software [ 54 , 55 ] . IDPicker , however , also con - tains several heuristics that further simplify the solution and its interpretation . The algorithm starts by collapsing the peptide - protein bipartite graph such that all pep - tides / proteins connected to the same proteins / peptides form group nodes containing multiple peptides or pro - teins . It then finds a set of disconnected subgraphs within a bipartite graph using a depth - first search . Finally , it performs a MSC optimization in each of those subgraphs . IDPicker extends beyond algorithmic imple - mentations , e . g . it contains modules for calculating con - fidently identified peptides ( using an FDR - based approach ) , modules for combining scores from multiple search engines , as well as visualization of results . The minimum set cover formulation is one of the most commonly encountered strategies in protein inference , and is recommended by the guidelines for publishing proteomics results [ 46 , 48 ] . Its intuition is to select the smallest among many possible solutions ( Occam ’ s razor , parsimony principle ) , which can be justified by consider - ing the number of possible solutions when protein list consists of exactly n proteins . Assuming n ≪ | | , the solutions of smaller sizes are selected from a smaller solution space and are therefore less likely to be spurious findings . In many practical situations , including protein inference , the MSC formulation leads to natural and acceptable solutions . However , it is not obvious that a minimalist formulation should apply to biological sam - ples in which multiple paralogous proteins or protein iso - forms may be present at the same time . This approach also ignores other available information , e . g . peptides that are not identified ( all dashed edges in Figure 2B ) , gene functions [ 56 ] or mRNA expression levels [ 57 ] . The partial set cover formulation Although the MSC formulation relies on a set confi - dently identified peptides , a subset of such peptides are expected to be incorrect identifications . This fact pro - vides motivation for the partial set cover approaches where the goal is to find the minimum protein list that covers at least 100· c % of the identified peptides , where 0 < c ≤ 1 is a user specified parameter . Minimum partial set cover ( MPSC ) problem : Given a set of confident peptide identifications U , protein data - base , and parameter c ( 0 < c ≤ 1 ) , find a protein list L of minimal size such that at least 100· c % of identified peptides are assigned to the proteins from L . More formally , Figure 2 ( A ) A bipartite graph showing two connected components with five identified peptides and four proteins that contain these peptides . ( B ) An expanded bipartite graph showing the situation corresponding to the first connected component in panel A , with unidentified peptides added . The unidentified peptides are connected to their parent proteins using dashed lines .

Both MSC and MPSC problems are NP - hard in general . Thus , optimal solutions cannot be guaranteed in situations with a large number of identified peptides ( note that each pep - tide from adds a constraint in the problem formula - tion ) . A number of approximation algorithms have been proposed ranging from greedy algorithms to integer pro - gramming , and several such algorithms have been tested in protein inference [ 58 ] . Both the MSC and MPSC problem formulations result in situations where it is not possible to distinguish among proteins identified exclusively by degenerate peptides ( e . g . proteins P 1 and P 2 in Figure 2 ) . Nesvizhskii and Aebersold have identified several such classes of proteins , naming them indistinguishable proteins , subset proteins , subsum - able proteins , etc . [ 20 ] . Because such situations are com - mon for eukaryotes or samples containing multiple closely related organisms , different problem formulations are necessary to provide appropriate tie resolutions . The minimum missed peptide formulation The MSC - based formulations of the protein inference problem rely only on peptides that were confidently identified ( ) and thus ignore all unidentified peptides from the proteins containing at least one peptide from , see dashed edges in Figure 2B . In addition , these methods implicitly assume that each peptide is equally likely to be observed in an MS / MS experiment . The first combinatorial approach addressing these aspects was the minimum missed peptide ( MMP ) formulation [ 59 ] . This approach relies on the concept of peptide detectability ( appendix ) . To provide intuition for the MMP approach , let us consider the example in Figure 3 , which itself corre - sponds to the bipartite graph from Figure 2B . When con - sidering only peptides in ( solid lines in Figure 2B ) , proteins P 1 and P 2 would be classified as indistinguishable [ 20 ] ; however , given detectabilities of all peptides , it can be inferred that protein P 1 is more likely to be present in the sample than protein P 2 . Specifically , the three identi - fied peptides ( shaded ) are the most detectable peptides in protein P 1 . On the other hand , these peptides are among the least expected peptides to be observed if protein P 2 was in the sample . Thus , protein P 1 is more likely to be a correct identification than protein P 2 . Note that the tie resolution was provided by considering unidentified peptides . Before formalizing the MMP approach , let us consider a particular solution to the protein inference problem in which different peptides from are assigned to protein P i . Note that some peptides may not be assigned to P i (cid:5) x ij = 0 (cid:6) although their sequence can be mapped to the protein and the peptide is confidently identified (cid:5) t ij = 1 (cid:6) . Peptide p ij is defined as missed if and where d ij is detectability of peptide p ij . In other words , a peptide is missed if in a particular inference solution ( 1 ) it is not confidently identified and ( 2 ) a peptide with lower detectability from the same protein is identified and assigned to that protein . We emphasize that the peptides with detectabilities lower than the minimum detectability of assigned peptides for protein P i are not considered missed due to the fact that protein quantity influences effective detectability of all peptides in P i . Thus , for effective detectability below a certain thresh - old , no peptides are expected to be observed . The MMP approach can now be formalized as follows . Minimum missed peptide ( MMP ) problem : Given a set of confident peptide identifications , protein data - base , and peptide detectability for each peptide Figure 3 A detectability plot corresponding to the situation from Figure 2B . Peptides in each protein are ranked according to their detectability . The identified peptides p 1 , p 2 , and p 3 are shaded , while the remaining peptides are white . The situation provides intuition for a decision that protein P 1 is more likely to be present in the sample than protein P 2 . Note that detectabilities of peptides p 1 , p 2 , and p 3 are not necessarily identical in the two proteins . This is because they depend on peptide sequence but also on the context of the parent protein ( neighboring peptides ) . Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 7 of 19 , find a set of proteins that covers all pep - tides in and minimizes the number of missed peptides . More formally , minimize (cid:7) i , j z ij · ( 1 − t j ) subject to ( z ij − z ik ) · ( d ij − d ik ) ≥ 0 ( ∀ i , j ∈ N ( i ) , k ∈ N ( i ) ) (cid:7) i ∈ N ( j ) z ij ≥ t j ( ∀ p j ∈ C ) , where z ij ∈ { 0 , 1 } indicates whether detectability d ij for peptide is above or equal to (cid:5) z ij = 1 (cid:6) or below (cid:5) z ij = 0 (cid:6) the minimum detectability of peptides assigned to protein P i and N ( i ) is a set of peptides connected to P i in the expanded bipartite graph ( see Figure 2B ) . A set of identified proteins can now be determined as y i = (cid:2) 0 if (cid:8) j ∈ N ( i ) z ij · t j = 0 1 if (cid:8) j ∈ N ( i ) z ij · t j > 0 Alves et al . have shown that the minimum cover set problem can be reduced to the minimum missed peptide formulation [ 59 ] . Thus , the MMP problem is NP - hard and approximation algorithms are needed for large - scale problems . Alves et al . proposed an efficient greedy approximation algorithm that provides a good solution [ 59 - 61 ] . Alternative formulations and algorithmic approaches are also possible . For example , this algorithm can be generalized in a relatively straightforward manner to a partial set formulation or to a version that minimizes the overall probability of unidentified peptides . Although the MMP formulation was the first protein inference technique capable of resolving indistinguishable proteins , it generally shares the limitations of other approaches based on combinatorial optimization techni - ques . That is , these algorithms do not provide probabilities for identified proteins , unless post - processing statistical models are used [ 62 ] . Probabilistic inference algorithms Similarly to the previous classes of algorithms , probabil - istic approaches to protein inference generally consist of two steps . First , PSM scores are converted to PSM prob - abilities using algorithms such as PeptideProphet [ 38 ] . After this pre - processing step , protein inference is per - formed based on an assumed probabilistic model . In probabilistic terms , protein inference involves comput - ing protein posterior probabilities for every protein in . Several classes of probabilistic algorithms have been proposed so far [ 21 , 24 , 60 , 61 , 63 - 71 ] , with different strate - gies and levels of rigor in addressing protein groups and different run - time performance . Some probabilistic algo - rithms do not address degenerate peptides [ 63 , 65 , 68 , 70 ] , while some such as ProteinProphet [ 21 ] combine prob - abilistic inference with the parsimony principle ( for degenerate peptides ) and protein grouping ( for indistin - guishable proteins ) . In the following subsections , we provide an in - depth discussion of the three major prob - abilistic methods : ProteinProphet [ 21 ] , MSBayesPro [ 61 ] , and Fido [ 71 ] , and briefly mention several other meth - ods . We use the same notation for all models and , when possible , provide new interpretations of the algorithms . We aim to reveal inherent connections and principal differences among the methods . For original derivations and interpretations , readers are referred to the original publications . ProteinProphet ProteinProphet is the first and most widely used probabil - istic protein inference approach [ 21 ] , with importance comparable to the first automated peptide identification tool , SEQUEST [ 9 ] . ProteinProphet consists of four major steps ; together , they convert the original PSM probabilities from PeptideProphet to peptide identification probabilities and then combine the peptide identification probabilities to infer proteins . Pre - processing In order to obtain protein identification probabilities , peptide identification probabilities are needed as input . Here , the difficulty is to obtain one peptide identification probability from typically multiple spectra matched to a peptide . The solution used in Pro - teinProphet is to simply take the maximum value among the peptide - spectrum matching probabilities for peptide j ( step 1 , Figure 4A ) , i . e . where is the set of spectra identified for peptide j . If no spectrum is matched to the peptide , i . e . if then . Recently , the iProphet algorithm was proposed to improve this approach [ 72 ] . Combining peptide probabilities A key feature of Pro - teinProphet is that protein probabilities are computed by assuming peptide identifications to be independent pieces of evidence for the presence of protein i in the sample , i . e . where N ( i ) is the set of peptides mapped to protein i . This assumption , however , is not easy to justify because peptide identifications are not statistically independent . That is , if one peptide from the protein is confidently identified , the chance is higher that another peptide from the same protein will also be identified .

These issues are addressed via the following two adjustment steps . Adjustment for peptide identification probability To address the limitation due to the independence assumption , ProteinProphet replaces in the equation above by ; step 2 , Figure 4A . The difference between the adjusted peptide identification probability ) and the original peptide identifica - tion probability comes from the presence of other spectra ( peptides ) mapped to the same protein as peptide j . They are expected to change the confidence of peptide identification . However , it is not straightforward to estimate . Nesvizhskii et al . defined the expected number of sibling peptides ( NSP ) , i . e . the num - ber identified peptides ( other than peptide p j ) weighted by the adjusted peptide identification probability ) , from the same protein . Specifically , NSP ij = (cid:7) j (cid:5) ∈ N ( i ) , j (cid:5) (cid:6) = j P ( x j (cid:5) = 1 | S ) , where i indexes a parent protein of peptide j ( step 4 , Figure 4A ) . ProteinProphet then approximates , which is computed from ) and ) by using the Bayes rule . Since computing NSP ij requires , and computing requires NSP ij , iterative updating is used until conver - gence ( steps 2 , 4 ; Figure 4A ) . Adjustment for peptide degeneracy In order to address degenerate peptides , a weighting scheme is used to modify protein probabilities to P ( y i = 1 | S ) = 1 − (cid:9) j ∈ N ( i ) ( 1 − w ij · P ( x j = 1 | S ) ) , where w ij is the “ proportion ” of peptide j assigned to protein i ( step 3 , Figure 4A ) . Nesvizhskii et al . defined that w ij = P ( y i = 1 | S ) / (cid:7) i (cid:5) ∈ N ( j ) P ( y i (cid:5) = 1 | S ) , where N ( j ) is the set of proteins that contain peptide j ( step 5 , Figure 4A ) . This adjustment step is in accor - dance with the parsimony principle cause (cid:8) i ∈ N ( j ) w ij = 1 , i . e . one peptide is ensured to come from only one pro - tein in total . Note that w ij = 1 for all unique peptides and that w ij = 0 if peptide j cannot be mapped to pro - tein i , i . e . when i / ∈ N ( j ) . Since the calculations of w ij Figure 4 ( A ) A diagram of the ProteinProphet algorithm . The numbers in the circles correspond to the steps mentioned in the text . The presence of loops in the diagram represents iterative inference algorithms used by ProteinProphet . ( B ) Toy examples illustrating the impact of fluctuations in peptide identification probabilities on the inference outcome from ProteinProphet ( version 4 . 2 RAPTURE rev 2 ) . Top part shows four identified peptides corresponding to two proteins . Peptides p 1 and p 2 are shared peptides while peptides p 3 and p 4 are unique peptides for proteins p 1 and p 2 , respectively . The numerical values are the peptide identification probabilities used in the toy examples . Bottom : ProteinProphet results on seven data sets with minor changes in peptide identification probabilities . Noisy Input and Output : the peptide and protein identification probabilities respectively ; group : protein group probability ; N / A : not reported in ProteinProphet output . Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 9 of 19 and are mutually dependent , another itera - tive updating procedure is used until convergence . By combining these four steps , with a minor modifica - tion to include weights w ij for peptides in the NSP adjustment step , i . e . NSP ij = (cid:7) j (cid:5) ∈ N ( i ) , j (cid:5) (cid:6) = j w ij · P ( x j (cid:5) = 1 | S ) , protein identification probability can be approximated through a variant of the expectation - max - imization ( EM ) iterative process ( steps 2 - 5 ; Figure 4A ) . Since indistinguishable proteins remain indistinguishable in ProteinProphet , the grouping strategy is adopted by treating the indistinguishable proteins as one protein . Therefore , a “ group probability ” , i . e . the probability that any one of the proteins in the group is identified , is reported . As the first probabilistic inference method for protein identification , ProteinProphet has been very successful and , as part of the Trans - Proteomic Pipeline [ 73 ] , remains the most widely used protein inference tool . Although the degenerate peptides are handled by a parsi - mony - driven weighting procedure , an iterative method by ProteinProphet is used to obtain those weights and ultimately results in reasonable probabilities for proteins . Recently , the tool has been improved , mainly at the pre - processing step , due to iProphet [ 72 ] . By using the same computational strategy as in the NSP adjustment step of ProteinProphet , iProphet obtains one identification prob - ability for each peptide by aggregating the PSM probabil - ities of the peptide from multiple search engines , spectra , experiments , charge states , and PTM states . Limitations Because ProteinProphet relies on certain strong assumptions , e . g . the parsimony - driven weighting ( step 5 , Figure 4A ) , its outputs are not always sensible from a statistical perspective . One such scenario was noticed by the authors [ 21 ] , that for a set of proteins with shared peptides , a protein with a unique peptide , no mat - ter how small the identification probability is , always dom - inates the protein ( s ) without unique peptides . In other words , the algorithm assigns score 1 to the protein with a random but unique peptide identification and score 0 to other proteins . This is undesirable , since there are always a large number of random peptide identifications with close to 0 probabilities in real proteomics data sets . To address the issue , only peptides with probabilities ≥ 0 . 2 are used to compute protein probabilities . Similarly , we observed that the inference outcome of ProteinProphet is sensitive to minor changes in peptide probabilities . This can be illustrated by a simple example shown in Figure 4B . Consider two homologous proteins P 1 and P 2 with identi - fied peptides { p 1 , p 2 , p 3 } and { p 1 , p 2 , p 4 } , respectively . Sup - pose p 1 and p 2 are reliable identifications , but that p 3 and p 4 are not , with small identification probabilities . In the seven toy datasets ( A - G ) in Figure 4B , we varied the iden - tification probability of peptides p 3 and p 4 , and computed the protein probability using ProteinProphet . In data sets A and E , when the probabilities of unique peptides are not larger than 0 . 5 , ProteinProphet considers proteins P 1 and P 2 indistinguishable , and only reports a group probability ; in data set B , when probability of peptide p 3 is slightly larger than p 4 ( which has probability 0 . 5 or less ) , Protein - Prophet considers protein P 1 as much more reliable than P 2 ; in data sets C and G , when probability of peptide is ( slightly ) larger than p 3 ( which has probability 0 . 5 or less ) , ProteinProphet considers protein P 2 as much more reli - able than P 1 ; in data set D , when the probabilities are both larger than 0 . 5 , ProteinProphet considers both proteins to be reliable ; while in data set F , when the probability of peptide p 3 is 0 . 2 or less , ProteinProphet suggests that only protein P 2 can be the true protein , despite the significant probability that peptide p 4 is a random identification . This non - continuity of the inference results is counterintuitive . Naturally , one would expect the probability of protein P 2 ( P 1 ) decreases ( increases ) gradually as the probability of peptide p 3 decreases . Although ProteinProphet applies the parsimony princi - ple to the issue of shared peptides , it uses a probabilistic model and an EM - like algorithm . Thus , ProteinProphet distinguishes itself from the other parsimony principle - dri - ven methods , such as the combinatorial approaches dis - cussed earlier . However , it is not clear how often ProteinProphet actually leads to the same solutions as other various combinatorial approaches regarding proteins with shared peptides . In addition , with the presence of degenerate peptides , the inference problem is difficult ; thus , it would be interesting to compare the EM - like itera - tive algorithm used by ProteinProphet with the heuristics used by the combinatorial approaches to examine how efficiently they handle large data sets . MSBayesPro MSBayesPro [ 61 ] is defined as a full probabilistic protein inference method which provides “ perhaps the most rig - orous existing treatment of the peptide degeneracy pro - blem ” [ 71 ] . The MSBayesPro model includes peptide detectability in the probabilistic model ; thus it can , to some degree , distinguish among “ indistinguishable ” proteins . Model structure MSBayesPro is a Bayesian network ( Figure 5 ) serving as a generative model for the data . The high level structure of the network is simple : Pro - teins ® Peptides ® Spectra , which mimics the experi - mental protocol in proteomics where proteins are first digested into peptides , from which spectra are gener - ated . Hence , P ( y , x , S ) = P ( y ) P ( x | y ) P ( S | x ) ∝ P ( y ) P ( x | y ) P ( x | S ) , Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 10 of 19 where y is a vector of random indicator variables for all candidate proteins , x is a vector of random indicator vari - ables representing all peptides from those proteins , and S represents the data , i . e . all the spectra generated in the experiment . The Peptides ® Spectra associations are defined by the available PSM scores ( or probabilities ) . The Proteins ® Peptides connections , however , are determined by the sequences of the peptides and candi - date proteins . If the sequence of peptide p j can be exactly mapped to protein P i , there will be an edge pointing from the protein node i to peptide node j in the network . This is similar to the structure of the model used in Pro - teinProphet , although the latter is not a Bayesian net - work . However , there is an important difference between MSBayesPro and ProteinProphet , i . e . all peptides , identi - fied and unidentified , are included in the network struc - ture in MSBayesPro . In contrast , the unidentified peptides are ignored in ProteinProphet and other Baye - sian network models [ 69 , 71 ] proposed subsequently . Other than the simplification of the model structure , we believe there is no legitimate justification for excluding unidentified peptides from a probabilistic model . Such peptides will have the identification probability ; thus x j = 0 is guaranteed in the inference step . We note that it is these unidentified peptides that , together with the peptide detectability information , will lead to tie resolution between grouped proteins and improve the scoring of proteins hit by single peptides . The MSBayesPro model has an important property in that the peptide identifications are conditionally indepen - dent given the presence of the parent proteins ( Figure 5 ) . This is not to be confused with the independence assump - tion of peptide identification used in ProteinProphet . Actually , the conditional independence assumption in MSBayesPro will lead to marginally dependent peptide identifications if two peptides share parent proteins directly or indirectly through other peptide / protein nodes ( that is , if the two peptides are in a connected component of the graph ) . Furthermore , the conditional independence assumption aligns with the LC - MS / MS experiment . Con - sider a protein P i that is in the sample at some known abundance q i . Then , further knowing the information that one peptide is already identified from this protein does not inform whether another peptide from the same protein should be identified in MS / MS or not . With conditional independence , we can expand the joint probabilities of the set of peptides N ( i ) ( both the identified ones and those that are not ) from protein i as P ( x N ( i ) | y i = 1 , y i (cid:5) (cid:6) = i = 0 , q i = q ) = (cid:9) j ∈ N ( i ) P ( x j | y i = 1 , y i (cid:5) (cid:6) = i = 0 , q i = q ) . where q i is the abundance of protein P i . Model inputs and parameters MSBayesPro requires peptide identification likelihood ratios and a set of peptide detectabilities . The former is a required input to the method , and the latter , as required parameters of MSBaye - sPro , can be provided as an input , or ideally , peptide detectabilities should be estimated via a machine learning model from the same data set on which protein inference is carried out [ 24 , 61 ] . For peptide identifications , the input to MSBayesPro is the likelihood ratios rather than Figure 5 An example of a Bayesian network used as a generative model in MSBayesPro . Three layers are provided reflecting the LC - MS / MS experiment in which proteins are first digested into peptides which are then matched to the MS / MS spectra . The numbers associated with the directed edges indicate peptide detectabilities ( between the first two layers ) and PSM identification scores ( between the last two layers ) . Note that some peptides may not be matched with any spectra while some others may be matched with more than one spectrum . The peptides not matched to any spectra are shown using dashed lines . Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 11 of 19 the peptide identification probabilities that impli - citly include a uniform prior [ 60 , 61 ] . Here the original peptide - invariant class priors used to compute peptide identification probability are replaced in MSBayesPro by the peptide sequence and protein abundance dependent detectabilities , which are more informative priors . We note that this treatment in MSBayesPro is somewhat related to the NSP adjustment in ProteinProphet , which essentially changes the prior to incorporate information from the NSP values ( interestingly , NSP values may roughly reflect protein abundances , in similar ways as effective detectability ) . Note that unlike detectability , NSP is not specific to the sequence of a peptide . Using peptide detectability is an important distin - guishing feature of MSBayesPro . Detectability is required to build the conditional distribution tables between the Protein and Peptide layers and subse - quently to compute the posterior probabilities for the proteins . However , to use detectability properly it is important to consider the impact from protein quantity ( appendix ) . Li et al . [ 60 ] proposed a quantity adjustment formula to convert standard peptide detectability d 0 ij = P ( x j = 1 | y i = 1 , q i = q 0 ) to effective detectability d ij ( q ) = P ( x j = 1 | y i = 1 , q i = q ) , where q i , the quantity of protein P i , is estimated by the maximum likelihood or moment matching approaches . If a ( degenerate ) peptide p j is shared by multiple proteins , the network structure requires combining detectabilities d ij over all parent proteins of p j . Here , MSBayesPro assumes that d j = 1 − (cid:10) i ∈ N ( j ) P ( x j = 0 | y i = 1 , q i ) = 1 − (cid:10) i ∈ N ( j ) ( 1 − d ij ) . Alternative approaches in combining multiple detect - abilities may also work , but the key intuition is the fol - lowing : if , for a given peptide , there are multiple parent proteins all present in the sample , the detectability of the peptide should be larger than its detectability from any of the individual proteins alone . This treatment per - mits a non - parsimonious solution , because a degenerate peptide is allowed to come from more than one parent protein . Inference algorithms With the Bayesian network model structure and parameters specified , it is in principle easy to exactly compute the joint posterior probability for the proteins , i . e . . An optimal solution for the presence of all proteins ( the maximum a posteriori configuration ) is computed as . The joint posterior probability can be further marginalized to compute for the presence of each individual pro - tein in the sample . In practice , this is not always possible due to the prohibitive time complexity , i . e . the inference on Bayesian networks is NP - hard in general [ 74 ] . MSBaye - sPro uses Gibbs sampling instead of exact computation when a connected component in the Bayesian network is large ( it is easy to show that connected components should be considered separately ) . It is important to note that MSBayesPro also reports estimated protein quantities and the marginal posterior probabilities for peptides , which provide better scores for measuring peptide confidence [ 61 ] . Thus , in its core , MSBayesPro is also a label - free quantification algorithm . Further generalization of the MSBayesPro model has been suggested to unify the peptide and protein identification problems and perform higher - level inference on genes and pathways based on proteomics data [ 75 ] . Limitations The use of peptide detectability is both the strength and a limitation of MSBayesPro . The method requires good detectability predictions in order to achieve good performance [ 24 ] . However , prediction of detectabil - ity for non - tryptic peptides and post - translationally modi - fied peptides is not a fully solved problem yet , which limits the applicability of MSBayesPro . In addition , detectabilities cannot be expected to provide tie resolution for proteins with nearly identical sequences . These cases , however , reveal the limits of shotgun proteomics experiments and should be addressed by follow - up experiments such as well - designed targeted proteomics experiments . Another limitation is related to the computational complexity : effi - cient approximation algorithms are necessary for MSBaye - sPro to work on very large data sets . The Fido model The Fido model [ 71 , 76 ] uses a Bayesian network , but was primarily designed for fast inference . The major contri - bution of this method consists of two graph transforma - tions applied to each connected component : collapsing protein nodes that are connected to the identical sets of peptides and pruning of spectral nodes ( with user speci - fied parameters ) that results in splitting of the connected components . Both transformations facilitate tradeoffs between the accuracy and speed of the inference step . Fido also allows an application of advanced probabilistic inference algorithms , e . g . the junction tree algorithm , which significantly improve protein inference on large graphs . There are two major differences in the Bayesian network models used by Fido and MSBayesPro . First , unidentified peptides are ignored in Fido and a sequence - independent parameter is used as a replacement for peptide detectabil - ity ( Figure 6 ) . Hence , the resulting Bayesian network is simpler and inference is faster . Second , another parameter b is introduced to the model , which is the prior probability for a peptide to be identified from an artificial “ noise ” node . This addresses the situation where input peptide probabilities are not accurate ( e . g . many incorrect peptides are assigned high probability ) . We believe this is a legiti - mate remedy for disasters that can happen during the Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 12 of 19 peptide probability estimation . However , parameter b seems to be redundant given that ( 1 − α ) | N ( j ) | is the prob - ability for a peptide p j to be identified from “ noise ” . The authors indeed observed strong inverse correlation between the optimal values of a and b . One limitation of the Fido model is that it requires a decoy ( randomized ) database to find the best values of the parameters ( α , β , and γ - the prior for the presence of pro - teins ) by combining an ROC optimization ( in a supervised manner ) with FDR estimation . Some versions of this approach may lead to overly optimistic performance esti - mates . Decoy database - independent maximum likelihood approach may be an alternative to fit the parameters . Finally , the parameter optimization step dramatically increases the run time of the algorithm ( up to 2000 times ) , which compromises the overall speed of the method [ 71 ] . Other probabilistic approaches Yang et al . recently investigated protein inference from an information retrieval ( IR ) point of view [ 68 ] . This work is interesting because it leverages methods in the IR field to the protein identification problem in proteo - mics . The authors found that the Prob - OR score , which is similar to ProteinProphet without the two adjustment steps , is dramatically worse than Prob - AND score , which is related to the protein posterior probabilities computed by MSBayesPro if degenerate peptides were treated as unique to each parent protein . We emphasize that the IR method proposed by Yang et al . is inherently a ranking approach rather than an inference approach ; hence , it does not directly address the shared peptide issue as do the other probabilistic approaches discussed above . Gerster et al . [ 69 ] recently reported a new probabilistic approach , Markovian Inference of Proteins and Gene Models ( MIPGEM ) , that is similar to MSBayesPro and Fido . MIPGEM models peptide probabilities as random variables as in some previous approaches [ 66 ] and assumes conditional independence between peptide scores given their parent proteins ( Markovian assump - tion ) . Similar to the Fido model , MIPGEM does not con - sider peptide detectability or unidentified peptides although the authors suggested that including detectabil - ity would be a future consideration . Table 2 provides a summary of the major probabilistic inference methods . Several other methods are reviewed in [ 35 - 37 ] . Discussion Our main goal in this review was to present the chal - lenges , intuition and proposed solutions to the protein inference problem . With increased throughput of proteo - mics experiments , the tools and approaches presented Figure 6 An example of a Bayesian network used in the Fido model . Three layers mimic the LC - MS / MS experiment in which proteins are first digested into peptides which are then matched to the MS / MS spectra . The numbers associated with the directed edges correspond to PSM identification scores between the peptide and spectrum layers , while a , b , and g are the three parameters used in Fido . Note that unidentified peptides are not modeled .

These applications include inference and verification of gene models , identification of splice forms or post - trans - latioinally modified sites . Some of these problems can only be addressed using proteomics techniques and , as such , proteomics holds great promise in systems biology , biomarker discovery , diagnostics , prognostics and treat - ment monitoring . Undoubtedly , there is a need for more sophisticated methodology for protein inference , unbiased performance evaluation of these techniques , as well as stand - alone tools with graphical user interface that will facilitate transition from research environments to practice in biomedical sciences . We conclude this paper by discussing the current issues in evaluating protein inference algorithms and then speculating on the ideal protein inference approaches . Evaluation of protein identification methods Despite the development of computational protein identi - fication methods , objectively evaluating the performance of the methods remains a problem . Two strategies are cur - rently available : the use of standard samples ( mixtures of known proteins ) and the use of decoy protein sequences to estimate FDR at the protein level . Both approaches have limitations . To date , only a limited number of standard samples [ 78 - 80 ] containing 10 - 50 proteins have been used to facili - tate evaluation of peptide / protein identification . The advantage of using standard samples is that the truth is known ; thus , the accuracy measures , e . g . precision and recall , of protein identification can be directly computed . However , standard samples are frequently plagued by con - taminant proteins and the boundary between true and false protein identification is blurred .

For ProteinProphet , the underlying bipartite graph does not correspond to a Bayesian Network although it guides the EM - like algorithm through inference . 2 . MIPGEM uses a rule - based protein removal scheme to simplify the network structure ; 3 . Exact computation is used only for small connected components ; 4 . Gene centric proteomics was proposed in [ 77 ] , and implemented earlier in a deterministic way in [ 67 ] .

The second approach estimates protein - level false dis - covery rates with the help of decoy databases . Although the approach has been used in several studies [ 51 , 52 ] , two serious problems of the approach are generally ignored . We suggest that using decoy databases for evaluation of protein identification algorithms should be approached with these limitations in mind . First , unlike the decoy ( e . g . reversed , randomized ) database approach for peptides , the decoy database for proteins does not produce the cor - rect estimation of the number of incorrect protein identi - fications when the correct proteins comprise a significant portion of the database . In an extreme scenario , when all proteins in the database are present in the sample , all the identified proteins from the forward database are correct despite many peptides being incorrect identifications . On the other hand , all identified proteins from a decoy database are incorrect . Thus , using a decoy directly will produce a non - zero FDR , while FDR = 0 is the correct answer . This problem can be addressed by correcting for the bias due to the number of true proteins in the forward database . Let the number of identified forward and decoy proteins be n F and n D , and the total number of forward and decoy proteins in the databases be N F and N D , respectively . Let the protein level FDR in forward database be FDR P and the rate of incorrect protein iden - tifications from the forward and decoy database be γ F = FDR P · n F N F − ( 1 − FDR P ) · n F , and γ D = n D N D , respectively . An assumption regarding a decoy database is that the rates of the false protein identifications are identical ; hence , γ F = γ D . By solving this equation we find FDR P = n D · ( N F − n F ) n F · ( N D − n D ) . Note that there is a correction factor ( N F − n F ) ( N D − n D ) in this equation compared to the FDR formula used for peptides . Also , when N F = n F , FDR P = 0 as expected . A related correction is implemented in the MAYU approach [ 50 ] developed for FDR estimation from large proteomics data sets , i . e . the case when n F / N F (cid:8) 0 . Further corrections may be needed if the average lengths of the identified vs . non - identified proteins are different . We would like to point out that , for probabilistic pro - tein inference algorithms , theoretical protein FDR values can be computed based on the protein posterior prob - abilities . However , such theoretical FDR values are only accurate when the reported protein posterior probabil - ities are accurate . Hence , they need to be evaluated them - selves , e . g . against the target / decoy - based empirical FDRs . The second and more serious issue for applying the decoy approach is related to the existence of protein families . In fact , to our knowledge , no solution has yet been proposed . Simply speaking , a randomized data - base cannot serve as a good decoy for evaluating meth - ods on data sets that contain many degenerate peptide identifications . The reason is that such peptides are typically shared among forward proteins , which could be similar to each other due to biological / annotation reasons , but not with decoy proteins . As a result , a ran - domized protein database cannot provide indications whether the identifications made among homologous proteins are correct or not . For this reason , a rando - mized decoy database is expected to underestimate FDRs for eukaryotic samples , which have large number of shared peptides ( Figure 1 ) . The problem might be addressed using well - constructed non - random sequence database or using a closely related proteome database as decoy . Evaluating protein inference algo - rithms using such non - random decoys , however , remains a research problem . We emphasize that both standard mixtures and the tar - get / decoy approach for complex samples have their pros and cons in evaluating protein inference algorithms , and they are not mutually exclusive approaches . In fact , stan - dard mixtures can be used to validate the target / decoy approach for protein FDR estimation . It is generally a good idea to use both strategies for a more complete and objective evaluation . A need for guidelines for comparisons between methods Due to the complexity of protein inference , fair evaluation of the proposed methods has been challenging . This is due to two major aspects . First , reliable and objective valida - tion of the protein identification results is itself a challen - ging problem , as the FDR estimation is still unreliable . In addition , it is not even obvious how to compare models whose outputs are considerably different , e . g . those that provide protein groups and those that resolve ties between all proteins . Second , due to the lack of agreed upon guide - lines , avoidable unfair comparisons are sometimes seen in the literature [ 69 ] . In other works , different peptide identi - fication algorithms or scoring schemes are sometimes used as inputs to different protein inference methods , making the protein inference comparisons uninterpretable . In order to address this situation , we tentatively pro - pose the following principles for comparisons of protein inference algorithms . First , whenever possible , the same Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 15 of 19 or equivalent peptide identification scores as input to dif - ferent programs should be used . Second , effort should be made to provide inputs most appropriate to each algo - rithm considered . For example , algorithms that take all peptide identifications should be provided all scores , while programs that take only confident identifications should be provided such a subset . Third , at least one standard protein mixture data set should be used and all known proteins ( whether they belong to “ indistinguish - able ” protein groups or not ) in such data sets should be included in the evaluation of the protein inference meth - ods . This will allow the evaluation of protein inference algorithms on proteins identified without any unique peptides . Finally , and in an ideal scenario , large data sets from complex samples of unknown proteins should also be used to compare different programs ; however , we cau - tion that the current decoy database strategy may not provide reliable FDR estimates at the protein level ( eva - luation for protein data sets with significant fraction of degenerate peptides is a particular problem ) . The ultimate protein inference approach Despite the amount of published work , the protein inference problem is far from solved . We believe two aspects are crucial to the future approaches . First , the model should be probabilistic and with degenerate pep - tides treated in principled ways . Second , unidentified peptides should be exploited with peptide detectability incorporated into the model , perhaps adjusted to allow modeling peptide competition at the elution stage in a given sample . Despite the current limitations of peptide detectability predictions , especially for non - tryptic and modified peptides , it is believed that including detect - ability [ 24 , 35 , 69 , 71 ] or peptide - specific information for peptide probability adjustment [ 21 ] would improve the current methods for protein inference . Furthermore , we believe that better estimation of pep - tide / protein quantity might also help protein inference by , for example , improving the quantity adjustment of peptide detectability [ 60 , 61 ] , and provide additional input information for protein inference . As mentioned in the Introduction , protein inference can be viewed as a special case of protein label - free quantification . In fact , an ideal inference algorithm should automatically be a quantification algorithm , and vice versa . We believe much better performance can be achieved by combining the protein inference and quantification tasks into one statistical framework . Algorithmic development is equally important for rig - orous and yet practical probabilistic inference . Serang et al . [ 76 ] proposed an approximate solution by setting low peptide probabilities to zero and then applying the graph pruning procedure . In this way the complexity of the problem can be controlled at arbitrarily low levels with the price of potentially high error ( i . e . the com - puted probability may greatly deviate from the exact values ) . The Gibbs sampling approach implemented in MSBayesPro can achieve arbitrarily high accuracy in probability estimation ; however , the time required for the inference can be prohibitively long . A fast algorithm with controllable error bound is desirable . Applying well - established exact or approximate graph inference algorithms , e . g . the junction tree algorithm [ 76 ] , is an important direction for further investigation . Appendix Peptide detectability Peptide detectability has been defined as the probability that a peptide will be identified in a proteomics experi - ment given the presence of its parent protein in a sample [ 19 , 24 ] . There are multiple factors , spanning all phases of a proteomics experiment , that influence peptide identifi - cation . For example , during sample storage and prepara - tion , some peptides may be truncated at their termini resulting in semi - tryptic or non - tryptic peptides ( in the case of trypsin digestion ) which usually remain unidenti - fied in a database search [ 25 ] . Peptides with different hydrophobicity patterns may not be retained in the LC stationary phase ( hydrophilic peptides ) or may be insolu - ble in the LC mobile phase ( hydrophobic peptides ) . Peptides that eluted will be ionized with different efficien - cies based on the presence and distribution of charged residues in their sequence . Furthermore , in complex bio - logical samples , peptides are likely to co - elute with many other peptides and thus compete for ionizing protons during the electrospray ionization . Many peptides may elute and ionize well , but poorly fragment , producing MS / MS spectra with few peaks . Such peptides are diffi - cult to interpret by computational methods . In addition , peptides whose m / z values are outside of the range of the mass spectrometer ( 200 - 2000 Da ) cannot be identified . Apart from physicochemical aspects , there are several biological factors influencing peptide identification . For example , the three - dimensional structure of a protein could lead to the existence of sites with different sensitiv - ities to proteolytic digestion . Other sites may be post - translationally modified by one of more than 200 different post - translational modifications ( PTMs ) observed in eukaryotes [ 26 ] . Many such peptides typi - cally remain unidentified unless a database search explicitly specifies the PTM type or the sites of interest ( which , in turn , leads to a decrease in the number of identifications for regular peptides ) . Finally , different peptide identification software packages are based on different assumptions and are known to result in differences among identified peptides [ 27 ] . It has been shown that the detectability of a peptide at standard quantity , i . e . standard detectability , is a property Li and Radivojac BMC Bioinformatics 2012 , 13 ( Suppl 16 ) : S4 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2105 / 13 / S16 / S4 Page 16 of 19 of the peptide sequence and thus can be predicted from peptide / protein sequence for a given experimental plat - form [ 17 , 19 , 24 , 28 - 33 ] . On the other hand , the quantity of a protein also determines the fate of a peptide with respect to its identification . For example , peptides with high standard detectability that are present in a sample in low quantity may not be identified , while peptides with relatively low detectability present at high quantity may in fact be observed . Therefore , protein quantity and stan - dard detectability collectively determine the effective detectability of each peptide in a protein . Effective pep - tide detectability cannot be predicted from amino acid sequence alone ( unless protein quantity can be shown to depend on protein sequence ) and has to be estimated from a set of peptide identifications and their standard detectabilities [ 24 ] . A detectable peptide is related to a proteotypic peptide , which is “ an experimentally observable peptide that uniquely identifies a specific protein or protein isoform ” [ 18 ] . In practice , proteotypic peptides were required to be observed in more than 50 % of experiments in which their parent protein was identified [ 18 , 30 ] . The relation - ship between two definitions can be best understood from an interesting property of peptides in MS / MS experiments to group at either high or low end of the detectability scale in a standard sample [ 24 , 34 ] . In summary , the identification of a peptide in a pro - teomics experiment is a stochastic event that depends on multiple factors . It is therefore convenient to sum - marize all these factors using a probabilistic framework . The standard detectability of peptide p j from protein P i ( at quantity q 0 ) will be denoted as d ij 0 , while the effective detectability at an arbitrary quantity q will be denoted as d ij ( q ) .
