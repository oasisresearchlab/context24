It has been shown ( F ) Schematic diagram of methylation changes in wild - type ( (cid:49) / (cid:49) ) , that an intronic CpG island , known as “region 2” , in [ Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) ] double mutant ( 3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , 3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) ) , and Dnmt1 the Igf2 receptor ( Igf2r ) gene is methylated when it is null mutant embryos ( c / c ) during early development . During preim - inherited from the mother , but unmethylated when it is plantation development , the bulk DNA undergoes demethylation inherited from the father ( Sto¨ger et al . , 1993 ) . We found ( dashed line ) , resulting in hypomethylation of genomic DNA at the that the region 2 sequence ( presumably , of the maternal blastocyst stage . After implantation of blastocysts , de novo methyl - ationtakes place , resulting ina rapidincrease inmethylation ( yellow allele ) in [ Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) ] ES cells was resistant line ) .

Similarly , the 5 (cid:57) upstream region of ( red line ) , whereas in Dnmt1 null mutants embryos , maintenance H19 gene was methylated in three of the four methylation is disrupted , resulting in rapid loss of methylation in all [ Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) ] ES cell lines ( Figure 6E ) .

This suggests that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b partialdemethylationinoneofthelinesisprobablyfortu - encode de novo methyltransferases ( green ) , while Dnmt1 encodes a maintenance methyltransferase ( red ) . itous , representing clonal variation , as methylation of Mammalian De Novo Methyltransferases 253 were demethylated to approximately the same level as in Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) cells , suggesting that disruption of Dnmt3a did not contribute to the demethylation of these repeats . Similar demethylation of the minor satellite re - peats was also detected in E9 . 5 Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) and [ Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) ] embryos , but not in Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) embryos ( Figure 7B ) . These results suggest that the mi - nor satellite repeats , in contrast to other repetitive se - quences , are specific targets of Dnmt3b . It should be noted that the minor satellite repeats in Dnmt1 null mu - tant ES cells or embryos were demethylated to levels lower than those in Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) ES cells or embryos ( Fig - ures 7A and 7B ) , suggesting that Dnmt3b might contrib - ute to methylation of a subset of minor satellite repeats . Mutations of Human DNMT3B in ICF Syndrome Recently , the human DNMT3B gene has been mapped to 20q11 . 2 ( Robertson et al . , 1999 ; Xie et al . , 1999 ) , a locus associated with ICF syndrome ( i mmunodefi - Figure 7 .

DNA methylation stud - ies have shown that the classical satellites II and III , H19 in the other three lines was stable over 20 passages which are major components of constitutive heterochro - ( data not shown ) . However , to our surprise , a differen - matin , are hypomethylated in this syndrome ( Jeanpierre tially methylatedregion inthe Igf2 gene , knownas DMR2 et al . 1993 ) , similar to the hypomethylation of centro - ( Feil et al , 1994 ) , was almost completely demethylated in meric minor satellite repeats in Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) mutant mice [ Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) ] cells , but not in the Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , ( Figure 7 ) . This observation , together with the genetic Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) , or [ Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , Dnmt3b (cid:49) / (cid:50) ] cells ( Figure 6F ) . linkage data , raised the possibility that ICF syndrome The methylation level of this region in [ Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , may be associated with dysfunction of DNMT3B . Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) ] cells was comparable to that in Dnmt1 null To determine whether DNMT3B is indeed disrupted in mutant cells ( Figure 6F ) . We also analyzed methylation this syndrome , we analyzed immortalized lymphoblasts of the Xist promoter region in ES cells before and after derived from anaffected individual and herparents ( Car - differentiation . This region is moderately methylated in penter et al . , 1988 ) .

These ob - ure 8B ) . This missense mutation occurs in a region be - servations suggest that some genomic sequences are tween motifs I and IV , within the catalytic domain of subject to demethylation of unknown mechanisms , and DNMT3B ( Xie et al . , 1999 ) . A second heterozygous “maintenance” of methylation patterns of these se - change in the DNMT3B transcript from the proband was quencesin EScellsrequirespersistent denovomethyla - observed at codon 744 , consisting of a 9 bp insertion tion by Dnmt3 proteins . encoding three amino acids : serine , threonine , and pro - line ( Figure 8C ) . This insertion occurred upstream of the exon 23 splice acceptor site and was derived from the Dnmt3b Is Required for Methylation of Centromeric Minor Satellite Repeats adjacent intronic sequence ( Xie et al . , 1999 ) . The inser - tion is within the conserved region of the catalytic do - Despite their overlapping function in de novo methyla - tion of various sequences in vivo , distinct functional main , which is likely to be disrupted by insertion of a proline residue . Analysis of genomic sequence revealed properties of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are suggested by the observation that Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) and Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) mice a guanidine to adenosine mutation within intron 22 , lo - cated 11 nucleotides 5 (cid:57) to the normal splice acceptor displayed different development defects . This raised the possibility that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b might methylate site . This mutation results in the generation of a novel splice acceptor site ( AG (cid:57) TA ) , which is presumably re - different sets of sequences in the genome . Minor satel - lite DNA consists of tandem repeats at copy numbers of sponsible for the insertion of the adjacent 9 nucleotides into the altered transcript ( Figure 8D ) . Neither the in - 50 , 000 – 100 , 000 , located in centromeric regions ( Hastie , 1989 ) . We showed that the minor satellite repeats were tronic mutation nor the altered DNMT3B transcript was present in either parent , suggesting that it may be the substantially demethylated in Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) , but not in Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) ES cells ( Figure 7A ) . Furthermore , the minor consequence of a de novo germline event in the pro - band . Analysis of immortalized lymphoblasts from 50 satellite repeats in [ Dnmt3a (cid:50) / (cid:50) , Dnmt3b (cid:50) / (cid:50) ] ES cells Cell254 together with the chromosomal linkage and characteris - tic hypomethylation of centromeric repeats , suggest that mutations of DNMT3B are responsible for ICF syn - drome . Discussion Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b Encode Functional De Novo Methyltransferases De novo methylation and maintenance methylation are two distinct processes that are required for the estab - lishment and mitotic inheritance of tissue - specific meth - ylation patterns . An ongoing debate since the cloning of Dnmt1 has been whether de novo methylation and maintenancemethylationarecarriedoutbyDnmt1aloneorbytwoormoredistinctenzymes . Biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated that Dnmt1 is the major maintenance methyltransferase . In this study , we show that two recently identified DNA methyltransfer - ases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation in ES cells and early embryos . Inactivation of both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b disrupts de novo methylation of proviral DNA in ES cells ( Figure 2 ) and genome - wide de novo methylation occurring during early develop - ment , but ithas nodiscernible effecton themaintenance of preexisting methylation patterns ( see Figure 5F ) . Our findings thus provide genetic evidence that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b encode DNA methyltransferases which are pri - marily responsible for de novo methylation during devel - opment . While it remains possible that Dnmt1 might be in - volved in de novo methylation of some unique se - Figure 8 .

The insertion is derived from the intronic sequence flanking show lower methyltransferase activity than Dnmt1 in the 5 (cid:57) splice site of exon 23 .
