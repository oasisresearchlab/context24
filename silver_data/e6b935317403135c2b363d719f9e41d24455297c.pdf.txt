The development of a symptomatic OD depends on various fac - tors , including the damage and insufﬁcient repair of the sub - chondral bone plate . The ankle joint has a high congruency . During loading , compressed cartilage forces its water into the microfractured subchondral bone , leading to a localized high increased ﬂow and pressure of ﬂuid in the subchondral bone . This will result in local osteolysis and can explain the slow development of a subchondral cyst . The pain does not arise from the cartilage lesion , but is most probably caused by repetitive high ﬂuid pressure during walking , which results in stimulation of the highly innervated subchondral bone underneath the cartilage defect . Understanding the natural history of osteochondral defects could lead to the develop - ment of strategies for preventing progressive joint damage . Keywords Osteochondral defect (cid:1) Cartilage (cid:1) Ankle joint (cid:1) Subchondral cyst (cid:1) Natural history (cid:1) Pain Introduction An osteochondral defect ( OD ) of the talus is a lesion involving the talar articular cartilage and its subchondral bone mostly caused by a single or multiple traumatic events , but idiopathic OD of the ankle do occur [ 8 , 46 , 47 , 50 ] . The defect initially may consist only of cartilage damage caused by shearing stresses , with the subchondral bone intact , but a bone contusion following high - impact force also can cause a defect [ 41 , 62 , 65 ] . Ankle trauma associated with an OD often leads to subchondral bone cysts . These cysts are associated with persistent deep ankle pain thereby limiting the patients mobility . Most ODs of the talus are localized on the anterolateral or posteromedial talar dome [ 70 ] . Lateral lesions are usually shallow oval shaped and are caused by a shear mechanism . Medial lesions in contrast are usually deep , and cup - shaped , indicating a mechanism of torsional impaction and axial loading [ 4 , 11 , 12 , 19 , 58 , 66 ] . Even though elaborate knowledge exists concerning ODs of the talus , its etiology and pathogenesis are still not fully understood . Increasing attention is paid to invasive and sometimes expensive surgical treatments , while research for pathogenesis of the lesions has somewhat been neglected . In order to treat ODs in all its dimensions , more should be known about their natural history . The development of an OD may have a sudden onset , but the development of a subchondral cyst is most often a slow process . Why do some ODs remain asymptomatic and inert , while others develop pain on weight bearing , demonstrate persistent bone edema on magnetic resonance imaging and result in the progressive formation of a subchondral cyst ? Understanding this process might make it possible to interfere and prevent progressive damage to the joint . In this manuscript , the most important factors related to the development of ODs are analyzed . Etiology A traumatic insult is widely accepted as the most important etiologic factor of an OD of the talus . For lateral talar C . N . van Dijk ( & ) (cid:1) M . L . Reilingh (cid:1) M .

As not all patients report a history of ankle injury [ 17 ] , a subdivision can be made in the etiology of nontraumatic and traumatic defects . Ischemia , subsequent necrosis and possibly genetics are etiologic factors in nontraumatic ODs [ 50 ] . Furthermore , ODs in identical twins and siblings have been described [ 1 , 16 , 68 ] . The defect is bilateral in 10 % of patients [ 23 ] . Traumatic cartilage injuries generally comprise three categories : microdamage or blunt trauma , chondral frac - tures and osteochondral fractures [ 20 ] . Ankle sprains have a predominant role in traumatic ODs . When a talus twists inside its boxlike housing during an ankle sprain , the car - tilage lining of the talus can be damaged . This may lead to a bruise and subsequent softening of the cartilage or even a crack in the cartilage with subsequent delamination . Separation in the upper layer of the cartilage occurs as a result of shearing forces . Alternatively , separation may occur in the subchondral bone , giving rise to a subchondral bone lesion . Fragments may break off , and ﬂoat loose in the ankle joint , or they remain partially attached and stay in position . The lesions can either heal and remain asymp - tomatic or progress to deep ankle pain on weight bearing and formation of subchondral bone cysts . In cadaver ankles , Berndt and Harty reproduced lateral defects by strongly inverting a dorsiﬂexed ankle . As the foot was inverted on the leg , the lateral border of the talar dome was compressed against the face of the ﬁbula [ 4 ] . When the lateral ligament ruptured , avulsion of the chip began . With the use of excessive inverting force , the talus within the mortise was rotated laterally in the frontal plane , impacting and compressing the lateral talar margin against the articular surface of the ﬁbula . A portion of the talar margin was sheared off from the main body of the talus , which caused the lateral OD . A medial lesion was reproduced by plantarﬂexing the ankle in combination with slight anterior displacement of the talus on the tibia , inversion and internal rotation of the talus on the tibia . Clinical presentation In the acute situation , an OD of the talus often remains unrecognized since the swelling and pain from the lateral ligament lesion prevails . The weight - bearing anteroposte - rior ( mortise ) and lateral radiographs may not reveal any pathology , or only show an area of radiolucency . In case of a large OD the initial radiographs may be positive . When the symptoms of the ligament injury have resolved after some weeks , symptoms of persistent swelling , limited range of motion and pain on weight bearing may continue . If symptoms have not resolved within 4 – 6 weeks , an ( osteo ) chondral defect should be suspected . Locking and catching are symptoms of a displaced fragment . Chronic lesions typically present as persistent or inter - mittent deep ankle pain during or after activity [ 18 ] . Most patients demonstrate a normal range of motion with absence of recognizable tenderness on palpation and absence of swelling . However , reactive swelling or stiff - ness may be present . The natural history of osteochondral lesions of the talus whether treated or not is benign . We reported the long - term results of ODs and found only one case of radiographic progression after 10 years in 38 cases [ 52 ] . Reports of ankle arthrodesis following ODs of the talus are rare [ 18 , 52 ] . Cartilage and bone anatomy Cartilage consists of chondrocytes that lie groupwise in lacunae of the extracellular matrix they produce . The car - tilaginous matrix consists of collagen , hyaluronic acid , proteoglycans and a small amount of glycoprotein’s ( Fig . 1 ) . Its elasticity is based on the electrostatic connec - tions between collagen ﬁbers and the glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) side chains of the proteoglycans , the containment of water by the negatively loaded GAGs of the central protein of proteoglycans and the ﬂexibility and the mutual sliding of the collagen ﬁbers . Cartilage is avascular and is nourished by the intra - articular ﬂuid . The tissue ﬂuid of the cartilage matrix , which Fig . 1 Schematic diagrams showing normal anatomy of ankle carti - lage , subchondral plate and subchondral bone area . The cartilage consist of chondrocytes that lie groupwise in lacunae of the extracel - lular matrix , which contains collagen ﬁbers in an arcwise conﬁgura - tion , hyaluronic acid , proteoglycans and 75 % water ( upper left ) . The hollow haversian canal that runs longitudinally down the center of the osteon in compact bone contains an arteriole , venule and lymphatic duct for vascular and lymphatic drainage . The Volkmann canals run perpendicular to and connect the Haversian canals ( lower left ) Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc ( 2010 ) 18 : 570 – 580 571 123 comprises about 75 % of the total weight of the cartilage , functions as a transport medium . In the healthy cartilage the GAG side chains of the proteoglycans play an important role for the elasticity and maintenance of the water content of 75 % . As a matter of fact , we all walk on water . Cartilage does not contain lymph vessels or nerves and has a slow metabolism [ 27 ] . Mineralized bone consists of both com - pact and trabecular bone . Compact bone is found beneath the periosteum and acts as the main weight - bearing pillar for the skeleton . It is not a solid tissue but rather an aggregation of osteons , the major multicellular unit of compact bone . Each osteon is composed of groups of con - centric calciﬁed cylinders , each of which is made up of bone matrix proteins that form long cylinders - shaped structures , oriented parallel to the long axis of the bone [ 33 ] . Histopathology Koch et al . studied the cartilage and bone morphology in ODs of the knee [ 29 ] . They intra - operatively harvested cylinders of the osteochondral areas as part of a cartilage - bone transplantation in 30 patients . At the cartilage level there was a loss of acidic GAGs from the extra - cellular matrix and a decrease of the number of chondrocytes . Hyaline cartilage was often replaced by ﬁbrocartilage . The subchondral bone plate was thinned compared to normal osteochondral samples and had fractured areas . Parallel with a general loss of proteoglycans from the superﬁcial layers of the extracellular cartilage matrix , the amount of chondroitin sulfates and keratin sulfate was increased in deep cartilage layers and in the subchondral bone . Koch et al . [ 29 ] stated that all morphological features tend to indicate that the main area of action is around the sub - chondral bone plate . In 2009 Uozumi et al . [ 63 ] studied the differences in the histological ﬁndings of ODs in 12 knees . During the sur - gery , cylinder osteochondral plugs were taken from the center of the OD and examined with light microscopy . They classiﬁed three types in the subchondral bone area : ( 1 ) necrotic subchondral trabeculae , ( 2 ) viable subchondral trabeculae , and ( 3 ) cartilage without bone trabeculae . Uozumi et al . [ 63 ] stated that the initial change in the subchondral area is bone necrosis or subchondral fracture ; the necrotic bone is then absorbed and replaced either by viable subchondral trabeculae or cartilage without bone trabeculae . An abnormal subchondral plate is likely to be one of the major factors in inﬂuencing the long - term outcome of articular cartilage repair . Qiu et al . [ 40 ] studied ODs in femoral condyles of rabbits and found that the presence of an advanced and irregular subchondral plate was associated with degradation of repaired articular surface . Cause of pain in osteochondral ankle lesions Several factors can play a role in the cause of pain in ODs . A raise in intra - osseous pressure has been mentioned as a cause of pain and has been associated with joint degener - ation [ 2 , 3 , 64 ] . Restoration or decrease in the intra - osseous pressure can be accomplished by medullary decompression [ 28 , 57 ] . A rise in intra - articular pressure can be a cause of pain in degenerative joint disease . Goddard and Gosling have found a linear correlation between experience pain in osteoarthritis and resting intra - articular pressure of the synovial ﬂuid [ 21 ] . A connection of synovial hypertrophy and raised intra - articular pressure in arthritis has been demonstrated by Bu¨nger et al . [ 10 ] . However , it is unlikely that in a localized osteochondral talar defect a raise in intra - articular pressure plays a role . These patients typi - cally do not demonstrate relevant joint effusion . Nerve endings can be found in the synovium and joint capsule . Joint capsule and the soft tissue around the joint are important triggers of nociception . The upregulation of substance P - and CGRP - positive neurons in response to arthritic changes suggests a mechanism involving neuro - peptides in the maintenance of a painful degenerative joint disease [ 49 ] . Patients with an OD of the ankle , however , generally do not show much synovitis . The synovium of the anterior ankle joint can be palpated since it lies directly under the skin . These patients usually can differentiate this secondary synovial pain from the deep ankle pain caused by the OD . The disabling deep ankle pain on weight bearing cannot be reproduced during physical examination . The most probable cause of this pain is the nerve endings in the subchondral bone that have been ﬁrstly detected in the early nineties [ 33 ] . Within each osteon a hallow tube , known as a Haversian canal , runs longitudinally down the center of the osteon . It contains an arteriole , venule and lymphatic duct to provide the vascular and lymphatic drainage of compact bone . In addition to the longitudinally oriented Haversian canals , a series of canals known as Volkmann’s canals run perpen - dicularly to and interconnect the Haversian canals ( Fig . 1 ) . Mach et al . [ 33 ] studied mouse femora and found that not all osteons are innervated . The likelihood of an osteon being innervated is greatest in the proximal head followed by the distal head and then the diaphysis of the femur . There are CGRP - immunoreactive and RT - 97 ( clone name of neuroﬁlament ) immunoreactive nerve ﬁbers , which suggests that the mineralized bone , the bone marrow and the periosteum are innervated by both unmyelinized and myelinized ﬁbers . These ﬁbers contain A - b , A - d and C - ﬁbers that conduct sensory input from the periphery to the spinal cord . In general , the areas in mineralized bone that underwent the greatest mechanical stress and loading , 572 Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc ( 2010 ) 18 : 570 – 580 123 that had the highest metabolic rate , and that were most vascularized , had the highest density of sensory and sym - pathetic ﬁbers [ 33 ] . The fact that there is abundant inner - vation of bone marrow possibly explains the observation that patients with bone diseases already experience pain before there is any radiological evidence of bone destruc - tion or involvement of the periosteum . Macrophages , the precursor cells of the osteoclasts , form important accessory cells in the regulation of bone metabolism and destruction . Chronic macrophage activation and vascular derangements lead to low PH , local bone demineralization ( acid attack ) , and H ? - mediated stimulation of the primary afferent nociceptive nerve ﬁbers [ 31 ] . Pain probably develops as a rise in ﬂuid pressure , and a decrease in pH excitates nerve ﬁbers present in bone . Joint congruency versus cartilage thickness The cartilage of the talar dome is thin in comparison with the cartilage of other articulating surfaces . The average cartilage thickness of the talar dome is 1 . 11 ( ± 0 . 28 mm ) in women and 1 . 35 ( ± 0 . 22 mm ) in men [ 59 ] . Shepherd and Seedhom [ 55 ] found almost similar values . In 1891 , Braune and Fischer [ 5 ] proposed that articular cartilage is thicker in regions of low congruence . Simon et al . [ 56 ] related joint congruence to cartilage thickness . They calculated con - gruence ratios for canine joints by dividing the average length of the congruent surface by the average length of the total articular surface . The ankle with the thinnest articular cartilage had the highest ratio , and the knee with the thickest cartilage had the lowest ratio . Shepherd and Seedhom [ 55 ] conducted a similar study with human cadaver specimens . The average thickness of the cartilage in the ankle , hip , and knee joints were 1 . 2 mm ( 1 . 0 – 1 . 6 ) , 1 . 6 mm ( 1 . 4 – 2 . 0 ) and 2 . 2 mm ( 1 . 7 – 2 . 6 ) , respectively . The thickness of the cartilage appeared to be related to the congruence of a joint . Shepherd and Seedhom [ 55 ] hypothesized that congruent joint surfaces , such as those in the ankle and elbow , are covered only by thin articular cartilage because the compressive loads are spread over a wide area , decreasing local joint stresses and eliminating the necessity for large cartilaginous deformations . Incon - gruent joints are covered by thicker cartilage which more easily deforms , thereby increasing the load - bearing area and decreasing the stress per unit area . Cartilage , subchondral bone and loading Tissue changes the structure in response to the functional demands imposed on them . Connective tissue has the ability to alter structure in response to mechanical loading . Adaptation is affected by different cells . Cartilage has a much lower response to mechanical adaptation when compared to bone . Bone remodeling is regulated by osteocytes that respond to mechanical triggers by sending signals that promote osteoblastic bone formation . Osteo - clasts resorb bone at the site of microcracks that frequently occur in the subarticular spongiosa during impact loading . Large number of osteoclasts digesting parts of the bone plate lie in close contact to osteoblasts that seem to be compensating for bony instability by constantly remodel - ing the bone stock . Loading tends to thicken the sub - chondral bone plate in cases of overlying cartilage damage . This results in sclerosis of the subchondral bone plate . The load - bearing area of the ankle joint is relatively small compared to the forces it conducts . The load on the ankle joint during walking can be calculated . Procter and Paul measured the load to be 3 . 9 times body weight at heel rise during the stance phase of walking [ 39 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . Mow et al . measured a load of 5 . 0 times body weight at heel rise during the stance phase of walking [ 37 ] . Hence , according to the data of Procter and Paul , the force on the talus with every step taken by a person weighing 75 kg is 2 , 867 N ( 3 . 9 9 75 kg 9 9 . 8 m / s 2 ) . The average tibiotalar contact area is estimated to be 4 . 4 cm 2 [ 44 ] . This means that the average load on the articular cartilage during the stance phase can be calculated to be 650 N / cm 2 . During running , this load increases multiple times . When the contact surface areas diminish in size , this will result in an increase in load on the remaining cartilage . This happens in malunion after an ankle fracture . Ramsey and Hamilton [ 44 ] have shown that 1 - mm lateral talar shift reduces the contact area by 42 % , while 2 - mm lateral shift reduces the contact area by 56 % . Lloyd et al . [ 32 ] found similar values . In the latter situation the average load per Fig . 2 Schematic diagrams showing the calculation of load trans - mission through the ankle joint during walking . Approximately one - sixth of the load across the ankle is transmitted through the talo - ﬁbular facet , and the remaining load is transmitted through the tibiotalar articulation . F = force Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc ( 2010 ) 18 : 570 – 580 573 123 cm 2 in a person of 75 kg is increased from 650 to 1590 N ( Fig . 3 ) . A 2 - mm shift is thus an indication for correction and operative reduction because of the high risk of devel - oping degenerative changes [ 26 ] . A 1 - mm shift is generally regarded to be acceptable . This would mean that talar cartilage can adept to an increase in load of up to 40 % ! In the case of an OD the following calculation can be made . The size of an average defect measures 0 . 85 cm 2 on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) [ 15 ] . By means of computed tomography ( CT ) we measured the size of the talar OD in 50 consecutive patients that were treated for a symptomatic OD . We measured an average defect size of 0 . 65 cm 2 ( 0 . 5 – 0 . 8 cm 2 ) . The size of an OD can easily be overestimated on MRI because of bone edema , this can explain the difference . After debridement of a talar OD with a diameter of 0 . 65 cm 2 it can be calculated that the load on the remaining talar cartilage is increased by 15 % ( Fig . 3 ) . This increase in load is probably not enough to cause damage to the remaining cartilage since this ﬁgure lies far beyond the threshold of 40 % . Any varus or valgus malalignment can increase the load [ 7 ] and hence increase the likelihood of progressive cartilage damage [ 9 , 42 , 60 ] . Radin and Paul [ 43 ] argued that articular cartilage by virtue of its thinness is not a good shock absorber considered in terms of reduction of peak impact force . Although the underlying bone is much stiffer , it is so much longer by comparison , that its total compliance exceeds that of carti - lage . Peak stresses at the joint surface , however , are still greatly reduced through redistribution and deformation of cartilage . In contrast to the tibia , which is a long bone , the talus is compact , and peak impact force can only be dis - tributed over a small volume of bone . The small talar volume combined with its thin cartilage may explain why ODs are more common on the talar dome than in the tibial plafond . Thin cartilage is less elastic when compared to thick cartilage . Shepherd and Seedhom [ 55 ] suggested an inverse relation between the mean cartilage thickness and mean compressive modulus , i . e . , thin cartilage has a high com - pressive modulus . After measuring cadaver cartilage of several species including humans , they found that two factors contribute to the deformability of the cartilage : the thickness of the cartilage and its intrinsic elasticity . There is a curvilinear relationship between the magnitude of the deformation and the thickness of the articular cartilage under a certain level of loading . In the congruent ankle joint , Wan et al . measured a peak cartilage deformation of 34 . 5 % ± 7 . 3 % under full body weight in persons with a medial talar dome cartilage thickness of 1 . 42 ± 0 . 31 mm [ 67 ] ( Fig . 4 ) . Talar cartilage is thin and therefore less elastic . It makes the talus more susceptible to cartilage lesions and Fig . 3 Graph showing load in relation to tibiotalar contact ( black line ) . The green line represents the average tibiotalar contact area of 4 . 4 cm 2 for a 75 - kg person during the stance phase of walking . The blue line represents the same person with a tibiotalar contact area diminished by 42 % to 2 . 6 cm 2 , as would occur after an ankle fracture with 1 mm of lateral displacement of the talus and ﬁbula . The red line represents the same person with a tibiotalar contact area diminished by 58 % to 1 . 8 cm 2 , as would occur after an ankle fracture with 2 mm of lateral displacement of the talus and ﬁbula . The yellow line represents a person weighing 75 kg with an OD of the talus measuring 0 . 65 cm 2 ; the average load on the remaining cartilage is increased from 650 to 764 N / cm 2 Fig . 4 Schematic comparison of the deformation of the cartilage in a congruent ( ankle ) and incongruent ( knee ) joint before , during and after loading . Arrows = direction of water 574 Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc ( 2010 ) 18 : 570 – 580 123 microfractures in the underlying bone when exposed to high - impact forces . However , ODs occur in joints with thicker cartilage as well and whether or not an OD occurs probably also depends on factors like impact force and shearing stress . Cartilage has two components that enable the tissue to withstand compressive stress : a liquid and a multicompo - nent solid consisting of collagen and hydrophilic proteo - glycan molecules . The liquid is a dialysate of synovial ﬂuid that is incompressible , but able to ﬂow . However , for this ﬂuid to withstand the compressive loads that joints sustain , it must be contained . The cartilage matrix resembles a sponge with directional pores . The small diameter of these functional pores and their arrangement in circuitous tun - nels , created by the hydrophilic collagen end proteoglycan matrix components , prevent large molecules from entering the cartilage and offer considerable resistance to interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow . These characteristics provide adequate con - tainment for the ﬂuid to support the load . At any instant , only a part of the joint is load - bearing or compressed . If one part is in compression , the adjacent area is being stretched and pulled apart and liquid ﬂows to the unloaded area . In a healthy situation , the liquid is not able to enter the subchondral plate . It will only ﬂow to adjacent carti - lage . Fluid in cartilage is freely exchangeable , whether extra - or intra - ﬁbrillar [ 34 ] . Herberhold et al . [ 22 ] studied patellar and femoral compression for 4 h under continuous static loading with 150 % body weight . A maximal thick - ness reduction of 57 ± 15 % was observed for patellar cartilage and a volume change of [ 30 % , suggesting that more than 50 % of the interstitial ﬂuid were displaced from the matrix . However , when trauma has caused microfractures in the subchondral plate and subchondral bone it creates a situa - tion in which liquid not only ﬂows within the cartilage , but it can enter into the subchondral bone through the micro - fractured area . Damaged subchondral bone is less able to support the overlying cartilage [ 9 ] . Inadequate subsurface support from an abnormal subchondral bone might be one of the main reasons for unsuccessful cartilage repair [ 35 , 40 , 54 ] . Cartilage that is not supported by the underlying bone plate loses proteoglycans and glycoprotein [ 27 , 43 ] . The loss of negatively loaded GAG side chains and hydrophilic proteoglycans causes a decrease in contain - ment of water ; it ﬂows more easily to other places . Each step or other load - bearing activity causes water to be pressed out of the cartilage and pressed into the micro - fractured areas of the subchondral bone ( Fig . 5 ) . It has been demonstrated that continuous high ﬂuid pressure causes osteolysis . An intermittent or continuous high local pressure can interfere with normal bone perfu - sion and lead to osteonecrosis , bone resorption and for - mation of lytical areas [ 2 , 3 , 14 , 25 , 51 , 64 ] ( Fig . 6 ) . These changes in structure at the level of the subchondral bone are induced by mechanical forces , gravity , compression , ﬂuid shear stress and hydrostatic pressure . In the undis - eased situation we can say that ‘‘form follows function’’ . Irie et al . [ 24 ] studied calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) - containing nerve ﬁbers in bone tissue and their involvement in bone remodeling . The effect of CGRP on bone remodeling could be partly through its action on blood vessels , regulating local blood ﬂow . Possibly high ﬂuid pressures cause excitation of CGRP - containing nerve ﬁbers , thereby diminishing blood ﬂow through bone , and causing osteolysis . Compression of incompressible ﬂuid leads to local stress shielding . It is postulated that as long as the ﬂuid pressure is preserved , the bone resorption will continue . When the ﬂuid pressure drops , the resorption stops . Bone remodeling around the cystic bone defect will create a layer of dense bone adjacent to the cavity thus creating a sclerotic cystic wall . When the subchondral bone lies exposed because overlying cartilage is sheared off or because the cartilage - bone interface is damaged at microscopic level , it is subject Fig . 5 a Sagittal T2 - weighted MRI study of an ankle with an OD . The vertical conﬁguration of the water column ( seen in the center of the talus ) suggests that the water is pumped directly caudal under high pressure , perpendicular to the talar joint surface . b and c , Schematic diagrams of ﬁssures in the subchondral bone plate of an unloaded ankle b and a loaded ankle c . When the ankle is loaded , the water is squeezed out of the cartilage into the subchondral bone . The diameter of the opening of the subchondral bone plate determines the pressure of the ﬂuid ﬂow ( the smaller the diameter , the higher the pressure ) Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc ( 2010 ) 18 : 570 – 580 575 123 to continuous high ﬂuid pressures that cause osteolysis and subsequent large defects [ 14 , 45 , 69 ] . The subchondral bone becomes damaged because of damaged overlying cartilage and the cartilage damages further because the underlying bone is unable to provide support . This way , a vicious circle is started . Various types of osteochondral defects in the ankle There are various factors that may play a role in the development of ODs in the ankle . The ankle joint has a high congruency . A decrease in joint congruence will increase contact pressure per area . More displacement corresponds to increasing contact pressure [ 32 , 44 ] . Thordarson et al . conﬁrm that substantial displacement of the ﬁbula ( C 2 mm shortening or lateral shift or C 5 (cid:2) external rotation ) increases the contact pressures in the ankle joint [ 61 ] . Long - term follow - up studies have dem - onstrated that patients with persistent displacement of ankle fractures had poorer long - term results than those without persistent displacement [ 26 ] . Therefore , displace - ment of [ 2 mm of the ﬁbula in injuries should not be accepted . Varus or valgus malalignment of the ankle joint may also play an important role in the natural history by increasing the contact pressure in certain localizations of the ankle . Biomechanical experiments have demonstrated that in varus and supination the maximum pressure is located on the medial border of the talus , while in valgus and pronation the maximum pressure is located on het lateral talar border [ 7 ] . Increased pressure on an existing OD may negatively inﬂuence the healing of the defect [ 9 , 14 , 30 , 42 ] . Koshino et al . [ 30 ] observed the medial joint space in 146 knees during the removal of blade plate after a high tibial valgus osteotomy 2 years postoperatively . They found a clear relationship between the stage of cartilage regeneration and the postoperative limb alignment , with more mature regeneration seen in more valgus angulated knees . It is therefore important to detect and correct mal - alignment in patients with an OD of the talus . The consecutive stages of local ODs may help us to understand the development of the defects . Superﬁcial lesions consist of sheared off ﬂakes with an intact sub - chondral bone plate ( Fig . 7 ) . In a more severe defect , the subchondral bone is damaged , as with , microfractures and bone bruises . Bone bruises are seen as a decreased signal intensity on T1 - weighted MRI studies and an elevated intensity on T2 - bone MRI . The reticular type bone bruise is not continuous with the adjacent articular surface [ 6 , 38 , 65 ] ( Fig . 8 ) . In general , this type heals normally and the healing occurs from the periphery to the center [ 13 ] . The geographic type bone bruise is continuous with the adja - cent articular surface ( Fig . 9 ) . It is this type that is often associated with ODs of the talus . Spontaneous healing is impaired or absent [ 38 , 48 , 65 ] . This impaired healing could possibly be caused by the cartilaginous water content being forced - on every step - into the persistent ﬁssure in the bone plate underneath . In case of an osteochondral fragment , healing may be precluded by intermittent ﬂuid ﬂow on every step around the fragment ( Fig . 10 ) . Subchondral cyst formation has been hypothesized to be caused by the damaged cartilage functioning as a valve [ 53 ] . This valve mechanism would allow intrusion of ﬂuid Fig . 6 a through c , Coronal CT scans ( upper row ) with corresponding schematic diagrams ( lower row ) , showing the ankles of three young patients ( 26 – 37 years ) , who had deep ankle pain of 5 – 12 years duration . An opening in the subchondral bone plate can be seen in all three CT scans , with subchondral osteolysis that has developed into a subchondral cyst . a Coronal CT , showing a cystic lesion in the talar body , with corresponding diagram schematically indicating the mechanism of cyst formation . Black lines = nerve endings in subchondral bone . b , In this patient , the cyst has extended to the subtalar joint . c , Sclerosis is visible around the subtalar cyst 576 Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc ( 2010 ) 18 : 570 – 580 123 from the joint space into the subchondral bone , but not in the opposite direction . On the weight - bearing phase of gait there is full contact between major parts of the talar and tibial cartilage , with most contact over the talar shoulders [ 36 ] . During this phase , pressures in opposing talar and tibial cartilage are theoretically identical , which may result in the forcing of ﬂuid in the direction of the least resistance , i . e . , the damaged subchondral bone . Backﬂow is prevented by the direct contact of opposing cartilage . During unloading of the joint , joint space ﬂuid may re - enter the articular cartilage . On the next weight - bearing cycle , this ﬂuid again is intruded in the subchondral bone . This repetitive mechanism represents a vicious circle , causing the intermittent shift of synovial ﬂuid under high pressure into the damaged subchondral talar bone . Development of a subchondral cyst is then just a matter of time . Conclusion Most osteochondral talar defects are caused by trauma . They may heal and remain asymptomatic or progress to subchondral cysts with deep ankle pain on weight bearing . The pain in osteochondral defects is most probably caused by an intermittent local rise in intraosseous ﬂuid pressure Fig . 7 a MRI study showing a cartilage defect of the medial talar dome . The subchondral bone plate has remained intact , and there is no sign of bone bruise . b Schematic diagram showing a fragment that probably was sheared from the underlying bone Fig . 8 a Sagittal T2 - weighted MRI study of an ankle with a reticular bone bruise . The white area in the anterior talus represents bone edema . b Schematic diagram of a reticular bone bruise with intact subchondral bone plate . This type of bone bruise heals from the periphery to the center without complications Fig . 9 Schematic diagram showing the geographic type of bone bruise , which is continuous with the adjacent articular surface . Healing depends of the healing of the subchondral bone plate Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc ( 2010 ) 18 : 570 – 580 577 123 with occurs on every step , and which thus sensitizes the highly innervated subchondral bone . The development of symptoms and subchondral cysts depends on the defect type , joint congruence , alignment , impact force and shearing stress . Symptoms and subchondral cyst formation will only occur in case of a local small diameter defect in the subchondral plate . Cartilage has a liquid and a solid component ( i . e . , col - lagen and proteoglycans ) that enables it to withstand compressive stress . A congruent joint surface , such as the ankle , is covered by thin articular cartilage . Incongruent joints , such as the knee , are covered by thicker cartilage . There is a curvilinear relation between the cartilage thickness and deformation . Thick cartilage easily deforms , thereby increasing the load - bearing area and decreasing the stress area . Fluid from the damaged cartilage can be forced into the microfractured subchondral bone plate underneath during loading . The smaller the diameter of the defect in the subchondral plate , the higher the ﬂuid pressure . This intermittent local rise in high ﬂuid pressure will cause osteolysis and the eventual formation of a subchondral cyst . Malalignment of the ankle joint may aggravate this process by increasing the local pressure in speciﬁc loca - tions of the ankle . The pain in osteochondral defects is most probably caused by the repetitive high ﬂuid pressure and decrease in pH , sensitizing the highly innervated subchondral bone . Acknowledgments L .
