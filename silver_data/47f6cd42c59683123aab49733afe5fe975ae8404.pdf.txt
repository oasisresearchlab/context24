Acknowledgements In the Name of God , the Most Beneﬁcent , the Most Merciful The author wishes to thank : Prof . Dr . Petra Badke - Schaub for promoting this PhD research work , and for her non - intrusive and constructive comments and critiques . The author almost always has a big smile on his face whenever he leaves Petra’s oﬃce . It was not only because of the lively discussion , but also sometimes because of the way Petra gives her critiques ; the author was able to accept these easily and laugh at his own stupidity . Vielen Dank ! Dr . Joris S . M . Vergeest , for his daily supervision , encouragement , and personal help . While lifting the scientiﬁc standard , he also gave the author a very large space for creativity and freedom to choose . ”It is your research , not mine , and it is your responsibility ; I leave it to you ! ” is such a sentence the author often heard after argumentative talk that ended up with no consensus between him and the author . Hartstikke bedankt ! All committee members for their expertise which enriched the quality of this ﬁnal thesis . Their comments , suggestions , and corrections are invaluable . Dr . Prabhu V . Kandachar , the Design Engineering department head , for his administrative involvement which allowed the author to smoothly work on the project until the end . Dr . ir . Rudi . M . F . Stouﬀs , the chairman of Design Informatics Faculty of Archi - tecture , TU Delft ; Prof . Dr . Riichiro Mizoguchi from the Institute of Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research , Osaka University ; Dr . Rob Dekkers from the faculty of Technology , Policy and Management TU Delft ; Prof . Dr . Tetsuo Tomiyama from Mechanical Engineering , TU Delft ; and dr . Henry . H . C . M . Christiaans and dr . ir . Regine . W . Vroom for their help in the early stage where the author made the i ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS foundation of this research .

Colleagues in the Design Engineering ( DE ) department and Computer Aided De - sign Engineering ( CADE ) group for their cooperation . The author is indebted to Jouke Verlinden for his involvement during the implementation of CDIRS . Special thanks to Tjamme Wiegers , who with him , the author did not feel alone in rais - ing his children in a less religious society and enjoyed the inter - faith discussion . Tjamme gave the necessary Desys Project data along with nice discussions , while many other readings were also collected from him . The draft of this thesis was carefully examined by him . Also , a special thanks goes to Dr . Raluca Dumitrescu who , together with the author , faced almost all technical and administrative prob - lems regarding their research and to survive in Holland . The technical and ad - ministrative problems themselves would not have been solved easily without the assistance from the computer administrators Marco Bolleboom and Adrie Kooi - jman , and the department secretaries , Astrid Bijkerk , Marijke Timmerman , and Hanneke Sosef . The help and private communication from former staﬀ members , dr . ir . Peter de Jager and Jeroen Pulles , are very much appreciated . Thanks also go to Evren Akar , Dr . Alexander Shevchenko , Zhishan Wang , and Huaxin Wang for being such nice oﬃcemates . Genuine thanks are expressed to prof . dr . Imre Horv´ath , the head of CADE ; although in many respects the author did not agree with him , the author would not neglect his inﬂuence in helping the author to reach this current stage . iii Ir . Aad Bremer , the former Design Engineering department head and Mrs . Agnes de Haan , the P & O advisor to the author’s research group for keeping the author on the track when the working environment was not appropriate to do a good research . Thank you for the trust , and thank you for the encouragement . Without their trust and encouragement , most probably the author already gave up and quit like some other PhD students and staﬀs . Alvast hartelijk bedankt ! Dr . Ery Djunaedy and his family . Without their help , the author never would have gone to Holland . Due to the economic disaster across Southeast Asia , it was almost impossible for the author who was doing his master’s thesis to buy an airline ticket for the interview in Delft . None of his friends or relatives were able or willing to help , or did not trust the author’s ability to pay them back if something went wrong . ( Indeed , if something went wrong , the author will never able to pay back the loan with the normal salary in Indonesia for his whole life ! ) . Ery sent a long email of encouragement and called to discuss any possibilities for solving the problem in his oﬃce at the National University of Singapore . The author could not ﬁnd him at his oﬃce ( he had already left to be with his wife in Bandung , Indonesia , who was expecting their second baby ) , but the author found a paid ticket with the author’s name on it for the interview . After having presentation and a three days of full Dutch coﬀee interviews with all ICA group members in Delft , the author was accepted for the PhD position , but sadly also had to accept a clausal : ” no ticket reimbursement if accepted or full reimbursement if rejected . ” – Fortunately , no other PhD candidates after the author will have to accept this condition anymore – The Djuenady’s were very happy with this news and never asked about the payback . Months later , the author ﬁnished his master’s degree , and was facing the same problem of how to buy a ticket to start his PhD research in Delft . Again , Ery bought a ticket for the author - the one whom he called ’ akhi ’ ( my dear brother ) - with his credit card , while the ﬁrst one was not paid yet . If God has His Arsy ( throne ) , then the Arsy must be shaken by the Djunaedys’ demonstration of a brotherhood . Jazakallahu khairan katsiran ! Dr . Yogi A . Erlangga for being the L A TEXguru in this thesis preparation , and for introducing the gentleness and the beauty of the Salafy school . The Raam family , the Nugraha family , Mr . Helman Muhammad and family , the Jacobs family , the Supriyanto family , the Parikesit family , Bang Syamsudin and other Indonesian and Muslim communities in Delft , Rotterdam , Den Haag , and Amsterdam whose names the author cannot include . Para ( tidak lagi ) bujangan such as Oki , Hatami , Rusdha , Gea , Rizki ’ Kiki Gis ’ , Sanny , Ari ’ Pai ’ Nugroho , Ari Nurman , Said ( benernya sih : Irfan ) , Ary ’ Datuk ’ , Andi , Ican , Nandra ( Nganu ) , and Noval ( baca : Nopal ) for being such nice anak - anak to the author . The Abdurrahman Kadir family , all other relatives and friends especially Eko Ihsanto , Syamsul Bahri , Santi ’ Ode ’ Soekanto , Wisnu ’ Kadz ’ Pramudya and all their family , who make the settlement of the author’s family in Indonesia goes iv ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS smoothly . Mas Bambang I . Soemarwoto and Natalia R . ’ Ceu Iya ’ Mustafa , the author’s only cousins in Holland , and their daughter Karina ’ Ayin ’ P . H . Soemarwoto for their hospitality toward author whenever he feels homesick . Marbiah Abubakar - Jambak , the author’s mother , Muhammad Ihsan ’ Kak Ican ’ Jambak and Muhammad ’Irfan ’ Papang ’ Jambak , the author’s brothers and their families ( ’ Yuk Mila ’ Tirawasni , Dek Nurhasanah Wuri Utami , Inayah , Ikrom , Irham , Balqis , and Nuha ) for their love , continuously praying , supporting , and encouraging . At the most , the author and his family is indebted to Kak Ican as he has been the backbone to the Jambaks , especially after the past of the beloved father Ahmad Jambak . The author also hopes Papang will ﬁnish his PhD soon and together with the author will be able to payback the sacriﬁce of Kak Ican , the one who support the author and Papang to reach this stage . Mo kaseh Kak , kalu idak kerno toubouk - tu , kamek beduo dak pacak jadi mak ini . The author hopes this thesis could fulﬁl the eﬀort of the Jambaks to promote the value of education and knowledge in the riches - oriented society of number 30 of world’s most corrupt countries ( source : Transparency International , 2006 ) . The hopes and prays also go to ’ Nelly ’ Nawal Abdurrahman , the author’s sister in law and her family in Japan , who is struggling to ﬁnish her PhD . Ganbatte kudasai ! ’Aﬁfah ’ Iﬀah ’ Azzahra’ Abdurrahman , the author’s soulmate and lifelong partner , for being his lovely wife , taking care of his sons – his walking hearts – and for trusting him completely although sometimes this trust was tearful and painful for her . No matter how far and high the author must go to achieve , she is always better than him because of the above reasons . Without her role in all of this , it is inconceivable for the author to believe he could have ﬁnished this research . Ahmad Asadillah ’ Asad ’ Abdurrahman Hasan , Ahmad Abdurrahiem ’ Ahmad ’ Salim Fiddaroini , and Ahmad Abdulhaq ’ Abduh ’ Mutawakkil – the most beautiful and joyful gifts in the author’s life . They deserve the author’s sincere thanks for , because of them , he refused to give up and fought any and all obstacles . The author hopes this piece of work will be a good foundation and source of encour - agement and inspiration for their better life . To conclude this acknowledgement , the author would like to make an apology to his mothers , his brothers , his wife , and his sons for their tears and suﬀering caused by the commitment of the author to this research work , especially his absence for the last two years . The author wishes to be able to compensate for his absence , either in the future or otherwise , hopefully , this commitment may cause a better reunion in the next life .

To raise new questions , new possibilities , to regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science . ” - Albert Einstein 1 . 1 Data , Information and Knowledge in Design Process The design process has been formalized , described and interpreted in many ways [ Cross , 1995 ; French , 1998 ; Hyde , 1989 ; Pahl and Beitz , 1995 ; Roozenburg and Eekels , 1995 ] , and has ended up with diﬀerent representations of design process diagrams . Furthermore , a comprehensive look at the design process can be found in Braha and Maimon [ 1997 ] work . All of these descriptions can be simpliﬁed and described as a series of activities including analysis , synthesis , representa - tion / simulation , evaluation , and decision , as shown in Figure 1 . 1 . First , based on need , motivation or the speciﬁc design task , the designer ( s ) researches the prob - lem area and analyzes it . The designer ( s ) then synthesizes all of the necessary information in order to produce ( some alternative ) problem solutions candidates . These problem solutions candidates will then be simulated or represented in a CAD system or a simple pencil sketch and will then be evaluated before a deci - sion can be made . Certainly , large amounts of data , information and knowledge are involved throughout the design process [ Court , 1997 ; Rodgers et al . , 2001 ] . 1 2 INTRODUCTION : GETTING INTO THE CONTEXT 1 . 1 Factually , a design process can be seen as an activity designed to transform the available data , information , knowledge and expertise to construct a map from an expressed solution need [ Lang et al . , 2002 ] . Figure 1 . 1 : Basic design cycle [ Roozenburg and Eekels , 1995 ] While the deﬁnitions of data , information , knowledge and their relationships remain debatable [ see Court , 1997 ; Eckert et al . , 2005 ; Groﬀ and Jones , 2003 ; Maier et al . , 2005 ; McMahon et al . , 2004 ; Morroni , 2006 ; Stenmark , 2002 ; Tuomi , 1999 ; Wang and Ariguzo , 2004 ] , traditionally , ”data” is understood as raw facts . For instance , material properties are just a list of a number of physical facts about such materials . Meanwhile , ”information” gives them meaning by connecting these pieces of data to certain topics . In this case , the information about design material might allow the designer to choose which material is suitable for the alternative solution , but will not disclose the separate number that appears in each of the physical properties of the material . ”Knowledge” is created when information is observed by the designer and recorded by his memory through a mental activity . Furthermore , knowledge adds information to the understanding and capability of the owner of that knowledge and places them in a state of knowing that guides actions , whereas data and information simply inform or even confuse . For that reason , designers can be deﬁned as information processing systems in 1 . 1 DATA , INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE IN DESIGN PROCESS 3 order to solve design problems or to ﬁnd ideas , as illustrated in Figure 1 . 2 . There - fore , the result of a design project depends very much on the initial know - ledge and expertise of the designer ( s ) and also on the information obtained during the design process by any means of information retrieval . The initial knowledge or information is referred to as any knowledge or information that a designer has before he starts to retrieve necessary information . Expertise is regarded as the ca - pability of converting a designer’s knowledge into actions in a speciﬁc area . These components are interrelated and inﬂuence each other . For example , knowledge and expertise do not only diﬀer in their capacity to initiate search terms in an information retrieval process , but they also diﬀer in their capacity to judge and utilize the information search results . Conversely , if the quality of incoming in - formation is higher , it will positively inﬂuence the designers’ ability in the design decision - making and problem - solving areas while also reﬂecting the level of the designer’s expertise . Figure 1 . 2 : Designer as an information processing system . Adapted from [ Wiegeraad , 1999 ] Unfortunately , the amount of data , knowledge and information to be handled by designers is often too large , broad and unmanageable to be implemented into a well - structured system . As a result , although data , information and knowledge are abundantly available and surround the designer , getting access to the correct and necessary knowledge or information for a particular design process is not always an easy task [ Cave and Noble , 1986 ; Lang et al . , 2002 ] . The challenge of the above issue does not only come from the size , types and diﬃculties in utilizing the data , information and knowledge from various lo - cations , domains and disciplines ( as shown in Figure 1 . 3 ) but also through the ambiguity between connections / relationships , sequences , and keywords . Because 4 INTRODUCTION : GETTING INTO THE CONTEXT 1 . 1 of this deﬁcit , in many cases , designers often do not complete a great deal of infor - mational research [ Rouse and Cody , 1989 ] , preferring instead to use information they already possess [ Court , 1997 ] . As a result , informal communication with a nearby colleague is often preferred over a systematic search through literature , patent databases and so forth . This situation merely leads to the risk of making wrong decisions and overlooking new possibilities concepts . In addition , this situ - ation also results in many designs being generated without the beneﬁt of existing information in the design environment . In the end , this could degrade the quality of the design and / or unnecessarily lengthen the design process . ( a ) Information sources ( b ) Information types Figure 1 . 3 : Information Sources and Types [ Wiegeraad , 1999 ] For an expert or experienced designer , it is relatively easy to understand the context of such data , information or knowledge to be accessed and applied and to predict the consequences of such actions in each design state . This kind of un - derstanding is deﬁned as knowledge about knowledge and termed by Hori [ 1997 ] , 1 . 2 DATA , INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE HANDLING IN EARLY DESIGN PHASES 5 Clarkson and Hamilton [ 2000 ] , as ”meta - knowledge” . For the purpose of this re - search , meta - knowledge in this thesis is more speciﬁed knowledge about context , and therefore is termed as ”context - knowledge” and technically deﬁned in chap - ter 2 . For instance , this includes putting into practice which keywords are to be used to access the internet , which experts need to be contacted and consulted , which drawings needs to be learned , what practices would be best to adopt , etc . The concept of ”context” itself is being explored in many research ﬁelds , such as artiﬁcial intelligent [ Akman and Surav , 1996 ; Buvaˇc et al . , 1995 ] , know - ledge management [ Schwotzer , 2002 ] , natural language processing [ Br´ezillon , 1999b ] , and information seeking [ Kari and Savolainen , 2007 ] . The term ”context” is widely used but does not enjoy a consensus on its meaning . However , gener - ally speaking , it has to do with knowledge or information relationships . Indeed , Schwotzer said that knowledge never stands on its own ; it is always embedded in a context . In this thesis , the concept and term ”context” is explored and discussed from many angles . Furthermore , context knowledge terminology is introduced , referring to a subset of all knowledge that identiﬁes the context of speciﬁc knowl - edge or information . There are other reasons to immerse this context knowledge in the design envi - ronment besides its important role in design processes , as described in the above case . First of all , a design project is necessarily executed by a group of designers , so it is very important that they have the same goals in mind . Although they could have the same sources , they may not have access to the same data , infor - mation or knowledge . Second , the knowledge transfer from experienced designers to novice designers can be speeded up if the context knowledge is visible or easily available . Third , since most knowledge is in the designers’ minds , most design companies frequently suﬀer from knowledge loss if a designer leaves the company . 1 . 2 Data , Information and Knowledge Handling in Early De - sign Phases A design process can be described according to its phases and the outcomes of each phase , as shown in Figure 1 . 4 . The process starts with a need or design brief . The ﬁrst design activity is to analyze the problem or clarify the task . The output of this activity is a statement of the problem or a design speciﬁcation . In the conceptual design phase , one or more alternative solutions or concepts are developed ; one or more of them are selected and taken to the next phase . According to the results obtained in the embodiment phase , necessary feedback is provided in order to re - analyze or rebuild a new concept . After the necessary iterative modiﬁcations , a concept is chosen and detailed in the detail design phase , as some output , such as working drawings , production planning , etc . , will be produced . The early phases of design refer to the analysis and conceptual phase . Unlike the other phases , these phases are characterized by ill - deﬁned problems . They involve describing the real problem , the possible solutions , and the methods re - 6 INTRODUCTION : GETTING INTO THE CONTEXT 1 . 2 Clarification Conceptual design Embodiment design Detail design Production planning Task Specification Selected concepts Preliminary design Finished design Product ( a ) Product development phases [ Pahl and Beitz , 1995 ] Need Statement of Problem Selected Schemes Working Drawings , etc Analysis of Problem Conceptual Design Embodiment of the Schemes Detailing Feedback ( b ) Conceptual design phases [ French , 1998 ] Figure 1 . 4 : Two interpretation of design phases quired to obtain the solution , in many cases , cannot be completely validated . Therefore , design methods suggest to avoid premature commitment to a design problem solution , but rather iteratively and gradually propose design concepts , speciﬁcations , functions , and alternative solutions , and evaluate them as soon as possible [ Austin et al . , 2001 ; Hatamura , 2006 ; Jin and Chusilp , 2006 ; Ozkaya and Akin , 2006 ; Qin et al . , 2003 ; Segers et al . , 2005 ] . In order to identify the need , to generate or search ideas or concepts , to look up alternative solutions , or to deﬁne speciﬁcations and functions , designers generally use divergent approaches which involve the suspension of judgments . Meanwhile , designers use convergent approaches to evaluate or select those alternative so - lutions , which involves the imposition of value judgments [ Cross , 1995 ; Liu and Bligh , 2003 ; Roozenburg and Eekels , 1995 ; Thompson , 2005 ] , as illustrated in Figure 1 . 5 . The iterative process and the divergent - convergent approaches mentioned above are also true for the information search process during the design process . Based on personal understanding and knowledge capacity , one can initiate a search that is believed to contain useful information . In the divergent approach , some of this information are seemingly irrelevant but could lead to alternative or new ideas or could trigger a new search term [ Jambak et al . , 2005 ; Snoek et al . , 1995 ] . Other - wise , designers must reﬁne the search term that is believed to be closer to his or her design informational needs . When useful information is retrieved , designers 1 . 2 DATA , INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE HANDLING IN EARLY DESIGN PHASES 7 Divergent Convergent Level of solution abstraction Solution ( a ) adapted from [ Liu and Bligh , 2003 ] Needs Specification ( requierments ) Concept design Exploration Identification Generation and evaluation ideas ( b ) adapted from [ Thompson , 2005 ] Figure 1 . 5 : Divergent - convergent approaches might want to complete a convergent approach by detailing the results with a new search , as can be seen in Figure 1 . 6 . During this iterative process , designers gradually structure the connections among the incoming information and build knowledge by setting connections between one query to another . The situation illustrated in Figure 1 . 6 actually occurs in both human to human and human to non - human interactions . For the ﬁrst interaction that is human to human , a designer to expert discussion or a brain - storming session in ad design team can be used as an example . A designer can direct a question towards an expert in order to ﬁnd a solution or a problem based on his personal understanding of the design task or problem . The ﬁrst question may be vague for the expert , but he or she can answer the question or decide to gain further understanding by further questioning the designer . The more frequently the two parties exchange questions and answers , the faster both of them will reach a state of understanding , where the designer can ask very speciﬁc questions and the expert can more easily understand the question and therefore give his expertise to the designer . Obviously , the information search process on the internet can be taken as an example of a human to non - human interaction , illustrated in Figure 1 . 6 . However , a designer reading a book can also be an example of this interaction . Moreover , it can be taken as an example of a divergent approach , where an idea possibly comes to the designer’s mind , although he or she reads a book that did not have a direct link to his or her design project . When this happens , he or she can begin to shape the idea with the convergent approach by ﬁnding more speciﬁc data in more speciﬁc resources , for example , a design handbook , a material properties handbook , etc . A number of remarks can be derived from the above examples . First of all , there are two diﬀerences on how the designer and information resources interact with each other . In the case where sources are human , such as an expert or other 8 INTRODUCTION : GETTING INTO THE CONTEXT 1 . 3 Search Search results Relevant Evaluation Refine search term No Inspire new idea No New search term Finish No Yes Detailing Yes Yes No Yes Figure 1 . 6 : The information search model design team members , both parties gradually develop common understanding ( a ) 1 . Therefore , they can share this understanding ( b ) . They can also validate the ”need” for each party ( c ) . For instance , the expert can validate a designer’s question to determine whether it is reﬂecting his or her informational need or not , and the designer can discuss with the expert whether the answer from him or her is something he or she really needs or not . Meanwhile , the designer has to develop his or her own understanding in human to non - human interactions ( d ) . 1 . 3 Using State - of - the - Art Search Engines for Supporting the Design Process Today , the enormous growth of web sites has opened up opportunities for design - ers to retrieve a broad variety of design information , such as potential markets , existing competitors , materials , processes , etc . Designers use a search engine in order to retrieve this information from the internet . These search engines do oﬀer not only better algorithms , but also technology advancements that poten - tially help designers to gain necessary information . These advancements include automatic bookmarking , history , audio and video searches and playback , image searches , e - book searches , and communication means . The automatic bookmarking and history provide services where a user of an internet search engine does not have to bookmark any of the checked search results 1 Although the problems of communication between experts and non - experts are known , see [ Eppler , 2004 ; Stonehouse and Pemberton , 1999 ] , but that is a research ﬁeld by itself 1 . 3 USING STATE - OF - THE - ART SEARCH ENGINES FOR SUPPORTING THE DESIGN PROCESS 9 ( a ) Automatic bookmarking and history ( b ) Audio search and playback ( c ) Video search and playback ( d ) Image search ( e ) e - Book search ( f ) Communication means Figure 1 . 7 : The popular search engines and their features and can keep them in the historical search . This advancement keeps the search process and the results in one environment . Without this advancement , a user must bookmark a search result using the internet browser . It is also possible 10 INTRODUCTION : GETTING INTO THE CONTEXT 1 . 4 to search an audio or video ﬁle on the internet and play it inside of the search engine . While some of these multimedia ﬁles are restricted by copyright , some of them may be freely downloaded . Images or static pictures may now be searched and downloaded from a search engine . Search engines are able to not only search information that is in diﬀerent formats ( i . e . , text , postscript , Microsoft ™ oﬃce ) or diﬀerent languages , but are also able to go through an electronic book . Some of these search engines provide various communication services , such as email , messenger , and audio / video conferencing . These advanced features for popular search engines are shown in Figure 1 . 7 . At this moment , the notion of ”relevance” is still at the center of information retrieval research [ Baeza - Yates and Ribeiro - Neto , 1999 ] . Therefore , algorithmic approaches have been ﬁghting to improve search engines . It is fair to say that some of these search engines signiﬁcantly improve their query methods and techniques , bringing their degree of relevance closer to the actual ”information need” . Their conﬁdence in their search results can be seen by their oﬀers to give only the top web page in their ranking that is returned in a query ( For example , the ”I’m feeling lucky” service oﬀered through www . google . com ) . Despite the increase of users’ ( including designers ) satisfaction in available search engines , their applicability in the ﬁeld of design still has room for improvement . Companies are still looking for improved tools to assist the designer in retrieving information where the internet as a source of information is increasingly important . 1 . 4 Problem Statement and Research Questions In order to better articulate the problem statement and research questions of this research work , it is necessary to brieﬂy introduce the philosophical fundamentals of research in design , and the research - design relationship ( for more detail and further readings : [ Braha and Maimon , 1997 ; Fallman , 2003 ; Stappers , 2005 ] ) . Although both of research and design share their similarities , and each of them is essential to the other – research is essential to design , and viz versa – , they diﬀer in their aim [ Stappers , 2005 ] , and therefore an activity can be subject to one of them based on its orientation . Fallman [ 2003 ] simpliﬁes the discourse into two categories : knowledge - generating design - oriented research and artifact - generating research - oriented design . Both of these categories are used to articulate the problem statement and research questions of this research work . 1 . 4 . 1 Knowledge - Generating Point of View This research wanted to gain knowledge of how ”context” can give the opportu - nity to solve problems to gather knowledge , store and represent knowledge , and to manage it , and to reduce the risk of brain drain that often happens when a de - signer leaves a company . In order to do so , some research questions have emerged including the following : 1 . 4 PROBLEM STATEMENT AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS 11 • What is the concept of context ? • How to use or handle context ? 1 . 4 . 2 Artifact - Generating Point of View The existing search engines assume that a supplied search term is a mature ﬁx , and accurate information is needed . At the early phases of design , the design problem is ill - deﬁned , the concept is vague , and possible solutions are unevaluated ; therefore , the most likely informational need is also vague . At this point , designers are actually deﬁning and validating the information need . Consequently , in order to deﬁne an accurate ”information need” , designers should complete information searches iteratively while his or her mind evolves from abstract to concrete , from partial understanding to comprehensive under - standing of the design task , needs , problems , and possible solutions . On the contrary , most of the search engines treat an information search in a single query process . Subsequently , designers use search engines repeatedly , but the connec - tion between one search term and others , and how they are being grouped into a topic , is only structured in the designer’s mind . Usually , the connection be - tween information or knowledge sources , as illustrated in Figure 1 . 2 and 1 . 3 ( a ) , are structured implicitly in the designer’s mind . Not many available search engines enable the user to personalize the search process . Google ™ and Yahoo ™ are two that do allow their users to personalize their own search processes , as can be seen in Figure 1 . 7 ( a ) . However , for the design information management purpose , it would be more helpful if could also compartmentalize their search processes based on their design projects , because each design project had its own unique information search . Furthermore , while other search engines are still not concerned about retaining a search history , the features from the two popular search engines mentioned above give users the opportunity to capture the design process and the designer - thinking evolution . However , this feature will come closer to the nature of the design if the users have room to use their judgment instead of automatically storing all search terms supplied or search results clicked . By assuming that every search result is a product of the designer’s thinking , the prospect of capturing the judged search terms will open up possibilities of capturing designers’ thinking paths in each design project . The eﬀort towards knowledge utilization in design practice remains feeble and is still attempting to answer three big questions , namely , how to gather knowledge , how to store and represent knowledge , and how to manage it . The risk of losing knowledge that often happens when a designer leave a company can be reduced if knowledge products , which can be both the process and results of an information search , can be stored . 12 INTRODUCTION : GETTING INTO THE CONTEXT 1 . 6 From the above statements , some research questions have arisen , including the following : 1 . How can search engines better ﬁt the design process enabling designers greater beneﬁt from them ? These beneﬁts include : ( a ) The ability to support the iterative process ( b ) The ability to allow designers to connect the search process with other designers’ external information or knowledge sources , as well as allow designers the ability to build a context knowledge of each information search process 2 . How can search engines create an information connection or context - knowledge that is explicit to the designer’s mind ? 3 . If it can be made explicit , how can it be visualized ? 4 . Can this context - knowledge ( reﬂecting the designer’s thinking path , pro - cesses and results of an information search ) be stored ? 5 . How can a search engine personalize and compartmentalize the search pro - cess ? 1 . 5 Hypothesis In order to decompose the problem statement and answer the research question , hypotheses have been created and clariﬁed during this study . They include : • If the search terms of a search process , using an internet search engine , can be connected , then there is the possibility of making an internet search process more towards the nature of the designer . It is then possible to represent the context . • If a search is supported by a representation of the context of the information request , the probability of obtaining the right response is increased . The explicit creation of contexts and their adaptation and extension during the design process is the key to eﬀective information retrieval and managing the available information and knowledge . 1 . 6 Research Approach and Basic Deﬁnitions The problem of this research was approached from two angles . Firstly , a literature study to understand the concept of context from various domains and applica - tions . Secondly , an empirical study of a design project . In the empirical study , data from previous investigations on conceptual design tools were studied . From 1 . 6 RESEARCH APPROACH AND BASIC DEFINITIONS 13 these two approaches , a general formalism on the design process and context were developed . Thereafter , a system to assist context building and manipulation during the information search process within a design process has been concep - tualized and implemented . Furthermore , the implemented system has been used as a proof - of - concept of the design practice and has been evaluated by experts . A software system called ”Web - based Contextual Design Information Retrieval System” has been developed and implemented for the purpose of this research . This system aims at helping designers collect information related to their de - sign projects . Thus , the software name must be read as ”contextual design - information” rather than ”contextual - design information” . ”Contextual design” is a methodology used especially in software design that deals with issues of data gathering , driving and managing the design , team and organization contexts [ Beyer and Holtzblatt , 1998 ] . It is an approach to designing products that comes directly from the designer’s understanding of how the customer works [ Beyer and Holtzblatt , 1999 ] . However , in a broader sense , this system is aimed at helping designers during the execution of a design project to retrieve design - related infor - mation , or , in short , ”design information” contextually , regardless of any design methodologies or approaches . It is also necessary to clarify the use of the phrase ”information retrieval system” rather than ”data retrieval system” , although in design processes , both of these types of systems could allow designers to share the same necessitate . According to Baeza - Yates and Ribeiro - Neto [ 1999 ] , the ”data retrieval system” is aimed at retrieving all items which satisfy clearly deﬁned conditions such as , for instance , a relational algebraic expression that conveys the constraint that must be satisﬁed by items in the answer set . Furthermore , data retrieval , while providing a solution for the user of a database system , does not solve the problem of retrieving information about a subject or topic . The ”data retrieval system” could be very useful to designers when they are seeking speciﬁc engineering data during the design process as a part of the whole design - related information retrieval system . However , not all necessary design information can be speciﬁc and constrained into an informational need expression , especially in the early phases of design . In contrast , with an ”information retrieval system” the user’s informational need is translated into a query , which is a set of words which convey the semantics , and then the ”information retrieval system” will ’interpret’ the contents of the information items into a collection and rank them according to their degree of relevance . In many cases , the eﬀectiveness of an information retrieval system is judged according to its precision , or the number of relevant items within the entire num - ber of items retrieved [ Saracevic , 1975 ; Strzalkowski et al . , 1997 ; Xu and Croft , 2000 ] . In fact , the primary goal of most available information retrieval systems is to retrieve information which is ”relevant” to a user query while retrieving as few ”non - relevant” information items as possible [ Baeza - Yates and Ribeiro - Neto , 1999 ] . However , in design , ”irrelevant” information in a query process may ﬁt or be useful in a certain design context ( see Section 1 . 2 ) . This is the fundamental 14 INTRODUCTION : GETTING INTO THE CONTEXT 1 . 7 reason why the software title ”contextual” that comes from ”context” is chosen , despite using ”relevance” before the ”design information” phrase . Last , but not least , the term ”web - based” needs to be clariﬁed because , gener - ally speaking , a web - based or internet system is a perfect match as an information retrieval system , since the user of an internet system has to specify his informa - tional need as a search term ( keywords , phrases or a combination of them ) that will be executed in search engines in order to collect the intended information . In return , the search engine will collect lists of websites and rank them based on their degree of relevance . Considering this fact , one can say that every information search process occurs in an ”information retrieval system” . Nevertheless , the term ”web - based” refers to a more speciﬁc source among other informational sources in a design environment which can involve experts , books , drawings , charts , local computer ﬁles , notes , etc . 1 . 7 Thesis Context and Overview This thesis is constructed as follows : Chapter 2 ( The Chaos of Context ) intensively look at the concept of ”context” in various domains and application . At the end , the term ”context” for this thesis is deﬁned , as well as the term of ”context knowledge” . Chapter 3 ( Study on Context Knowledge in Design Practice ) reports the study on the indication of existential context knowledge during a conceptual design . Chapter 4 ( System Conceptualization ) introduces the conceptualization and architectural work of an information retrieval system that gains the beneﬁt of context knowledge , based on the ﬁndings of chapter 2 and chapter 3 . Chapter 5 ( The Contextual Design Information Retrieval System ) reports the implementation of a user interface that builds on the existing web search technol - ogy and operates in conjunction with a common internet search engine . Chapter 6 ( System Life - Cycle Illustration and Evaluation ) presents the illus - tration of how the system can assist designers in developing context knowledge during the informational search completed in the early phases of design . Chapter 7 ( Conclusions and Future Work ) closes the thesis with a summary and discussion of the presented research topics and hypotheses clariﬁcations , and concludes with some suggestions for future research . Chapter 2 The Chaos of Context : A meaning reconstruction survey ”The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think . ” - Edwin Schlossberg 2 . 1 Introduction This chapter aims at clarifying the ”context” terminology that is widely used in many domains and applications . In 1999 alone , an internet search using the keyword ”context” retrieved more than 440 . 000 documents [ Br´ezillon , 1999b ] . At the end of 2006 , about 244 . 000 . 000 documents were listed in the search results using that same keyword . Since the word is ill - deﬁned and used in many domain speciﬁcs with such an ad hoc manner , it somehow creates a chaotic situation that is diﬃcult for those who want to understand it . The strategy of this survey is to start from a dictionary survey , where the root and the common use of the word ”context” can be found . The root and the common understanding are used to draw the meanings from representative speciﬁc domains , along with a common concept of those domains . This survey also emphasizes how context has been treated and used in each domain and application . To reconstruct the meaning of ”context” , this survey work not only tries to ﬁnd a consensus of meaning or concept of ”context” , but also attempts to present the understanding of ”context” from various points of view for domains and applications . Therefore , it can be understood by readers from diﬀerent domains or applications . At the end of this chapter , three deﬁnitions of ”context” and ”context knowledge” for the purpose of this research work are presented . 15 16 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 2 2 . 2 Context in the Dictionary The Barnhart dictionary of etymology [ Barnhart , 1988 ] suggests that the word ”context” as a noun has been used since before 1425 and is borrowed from the Latin word contextus and the past participle of contexere . However , context , in the sense of surrounding parts of a text , was ﬁrst recorded around 1568 . Further - more , the Oxford Latin dictionary [ Glare , 1982 ] reveals the meaning of the root ”context” as follows : 1 . contex¯o [ CON + - TEXO ] , as an adjective , has the following meanings : ( a ) to join weaving or otherwise closely linking ( e . q . to make by weaving , joining , etc . , together ) ( b ) • to connect , link ( word ) • to compose , assemble ( speech , writing ) by linking together ( c ) to bring into close association , combine , link ( e . g . to make continuous , join ) 2 . Contex¯e [ CONTEXTVS + - E ] is an adverb and means in close combination ; in a connected or coherent manner 3 . contextim [ NEXT + - IM ] is an adverb and means in a continuous or unin - terrupted manner 4 . Contextus [ past participle of CONTEXO ] as an adjective has the following meanings : ( a ) closely joined , interwoven ( b ) connected , coherent ( c ) continuous , uninterrupted , unbroken 5 . Contextus [ CONTEXO + - TVS ] has several meanings . They include the following : ( a ) the action of weaving or otherwise joining together ( b ) the state of being joined , ( e . g . logical connection , coherent ) ( c ) an ordered scheme , plan , course ( d ) the manner in which a thing is made or constructed , structure ( e ) the state of being uninterrupted , ( e . g . , a continuous series or grouping together ) ( f ) a whole made - up numerous part , complex 2 . 2 CONTEXT IN THE DICTIONARY 17 For the time being , the above explanation for the root of ’context’ will be left as it is , and will again be referred to for the absorption of English or adoption in dif - ferent ﬁelds of research . In order to check the common understanding of the word ’context’ , three well - known dictionaries have been chosen for the survey . They in - clude Webster’s New International Dictionary [ Gove , 1981 ] , The Oxford English Dictionary , Second Edition [ Murray et al . , 1989 ] , and The American Heritage Illustrated Encyclopedic Dictionary [ DeVinne , 1987 ] . According to [ Gove , 1981 ] , ’context’ is deﬁned as : 1 . the weaving together of words in a language 2 . the part or parts of a written or spoken passage preceding or following a particular word or group of words and so intimately associated with them as to throw light upon their meaning 3 . the interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs 4 . • coherent in discourse • = contexture 5 . things or conditions that serve to date or characterize an article ( as a prim - itive artifact ) : surroundings 6 . the ﬂeshy part of the pileus of a mushroom or other pileate fungus as dis - tinguished from hymenium Meanwhile , [ Murray et al . , 1989 ] deﬁnes ’context’ as : 1 . the weaving together of words and sentences ; the construction of speech , literary composition 2 . the connected structure of a writing or composition ; a continuous text or composition with parts duly connected . 3 . the connection or coherence between the parts of a discourse 4 . • the whole structure of a connected passage regarding its bearing upon any of the parts which constitute it ; the parts which immediately pre - cede or follow any particular passage or ’text’ and determine its mean - ing • – transferred ( e . g . ”We carry on with us , from day to day , the whole moral context of the day gone by” . ) – ﬁgured ( e . g . ”It is literally impossible , without consulting the context of the building , to say whether the cups have been added . ) • in this context : in this connection 5 . = contexture 18 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 2 [ DeVinne , 1987 ] deﬁnes context as : 1 . the part of a written or spoken statement that surrounds a particular word or passage and can clarify its meaning 2 . the circumstances in which something occurs or exists ; the background or setting From these three dictionaries , the meaning of context can be combined into the following deﬁnitions : 1 . the weaving together of words and sentences 2 . the part or parts of a written or spoken statement that surround a particular word or passage and can clarify its meaning 3 . the connection or coherence between the parts of a discourse 4 . in connection with 5 . contexture 6 . background or setting and interrelated condition in which something exists or occurs 7 . the ﬂeshy part of the pileus of a mushroom or other pileate fungus as dis - tinguished from hymenium The item number 1 can be removed because this deﬁnition overlaps with the deﬁ - nitions of sentence and paragraph . The item number 7 can also be removed from the list because this deﬁnition is not only too isolated from the other deﬁnitions , but also has no connection with the Latin root form . Item 2 and item 3 can be combined because a verbal interchange of ideas or discourses certainly involve some spoken statements . Furthermore , although the meaning of item 5 can have the same meaning as context ( e . g . , This text is lying in this contexture ; Is there anything in the intention and contexture of these ten passages to warrant so grave a departure from the common meaning of the words ? ) , it can also have a diﬀerent meaning which can be categorized into the derivative word of context . There - fore , it is proposed that this item also be removed from the above list . From this dictionary survey , it can be concluded that the use of ”context” includes the following : 1 . the part or parts of a written or spoken statement that surround a particular word or passage and can clarify its meaning ; it also covers the interconnec - tion and coherence of those parts 2 . in connection with 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 19 3 . background or setting and interrelated condition in which something exists or occurs For the rest of this chapter , these three deﬁnitions are referred as the daily com - mon understanding of context . 2 . 3 Context in Various Disciplines and Applications Context has been exploited in many research domains [ Br´ezillon , 1999a , b ; Guha , 1991 ; Seraﬁni and Giunchiglia , 2002 ] . However , this word has been extended in many directions and is generally not well - deﬁned . ”Context” then becomes some sort of ”conceptual garbage can” [ Akman , 2000 ] , since the word ”context” is used daily and everyone supposedly knows its meaning without a clear deﬁnition . Otherwise , one will give an ad hoc deﬁnition to delineate the particular meaning from one’s own point of view [ Akman and Surav , 1996 ; Bazire and Br´ezillon , 2005 ] . The following subsections will explore the notion of ”context” and how it is used in diﬀerent discipline . It is a realistic expectation that there is no consensus among the disciplines related to the many aspects of ”context” . In fact , the common meanings found in the dictionary survey have apparently been used in confusing ways or have been extended exclusively towards a particular discipline which ends up creating new meanings . On the contrary , there is still a question as to whether a uniﬁed theory of ”context” can be realized [ Buvaˇc and Kameyama , 1998 ] . However , after the dictionary survey , the exploration of various disciplines and applications is the logical departure point in search of the understanding of ”context” . 2 . 3 . 1 Context in Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing The mobile lifestyle is now supported by many types of ubiquitous electronic devices that are present everywhere . Pervasive computing is the new research application moving towards increasing ubiquitous and wireless connected com - puting devices in an environment . This area of research not only covers existing wireless mobile devices , such as mobile phones or laptop computers , but also any device that can be embedded in an object and can communicate through the in - terconnected network , creating a completely connected , intuitive , and eﬀortless portable that is constantly available in such environments . Consequently , to reach these goals in this research area , this domain of research must deal with human - computer interaction problems . The use of context is important in interactive applications , but on the contrary , it has been noticed that human capabilities use implicit situational information ( or context ) to increase their conversational band - width , does not transfer well in human - computer interactions [ Dey and Abowd , 1999 ; Dourish , 2004 ] . 20 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 According to [ Dey , 2001 ] and [ Crowley et al . , 2002 ] , the deﬁnition of ”context” in the ﬁeld of pervasive computing was ﬁrst introduced by Schilit and Theimer in 1994 . [ Schilit and Theimer , 1994 ] argued that computation no longer occurred at a single location in a single environment . For this reason , the information on a location enabled users to query and use nearby devices , while also enabling soft - ware to track a moving object ( the changes object over time ) and adapt according to the 1 ) location of use and 2 ) the collection of people and objects . ”Context” , according to them , refers to a location , people and an object’s identity , as well as the changes in the objects . [ Dey , 2001 ; Dey and Abowd , 1999 ] and [ Crowley et al . , 2002 ] stated that after [ Schilit and Theimer , 1994 ] , similar deﬁnitions have been proposed with some other elements included , such as time , focus of intent , environmental elements ( temperature , season , etc . ) , and user’s physical , social , and emotional states . Context is also deﬁned as the environment , situations , and subsets of physical and conceptual states of interest for a particular entity . The above deﬁnitions are too technical and too domain - speciﬁc , since all of them seem too far from the common meaning that can be found in the dic - tionary . Furthermore , [ Dey and Abowd , 1999 ] and [ Dey , 2001 ] said that the above deﬁnitions are either too general or speciﬁc . Therefore , they proposed a new deﬁnition which seems to be the standard in this domain . According to http : / / citeseer . ist . psu . edu / , these two papers have been cited a total of 132 times since their appearance and have become the central issue for Human - Computer Interaction journal , special issue ( volume 16 , number 2 , 3 , & 4 , 2001 ) . As they stated , ”context” is deﬁned as : any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity . An entity is a person , place , or object that is considered rel - evant to the interaction between a user and an application , including the user and applications themselves . This deﬁnition of ”context” ( or often confused as ”context information” ; see : [ Shafer et al . , 2001 ] and [ Khedr and Karmouch , 2005 ] ) is converse to the item 3 of the common meaning of ”context” . In the third meaning of ”context” in the dictionary , the ”situation” is used to explain something that interchanges between two subjects . For instance , the information interchanges , by the above deﬁnition , the information is used to characterize ( explain ) the situation . In addition , according to [ Winograd , 2001 ] , this deﬁnition is still too general , since it uses open - ended phrases , such as ”any information” and ”characterize . ” From the facts given above , it is clear that in this domain , the deﬁnition of con - text , and the important elements that are comprised within context , still remain debatable . To implement such concepts of context , researchers face a trade - oﬀ between the scope of their context and the possibility of the implementation . It is not easy to include the social and emotional context of the user , but at the same time , if they reduce the scope of context , the system then only partially supports the context and merely turns to a listed - preserved users’ expectations system . 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 21 Input Output ( a ) Traditional ”black box” application Explicit Input Explicit Output ( b ) Context - aware application Figure 2 . 1 : Context is everything but the explicit input and output [ Lieberman and Selker , 2000 ] This way , the implemented system can become intrusive and annoying when the users’ intentions and expectations are not listed or wrongly deﬁned beforehand by the system designers / developers . Researchers in this domain dispute the deﬁnition of context , not only because of their diﬀerent views on approaches , but also because the nature of the system will support the context . The system could purely used the input and output of the computation system point of view to implement the context . Figure 2 . 1 shows that Lieberman and Selker [ 2000 ] used the shifting of computation point of view from traditional ”black box” application to context - aware application to deﬁne context as everything but explicit input and output . The implementation of a context concept in a pocket PC , shown in Figure 2 . 2 could give two diﬀerent views of how the context possibly be implemented . First of all , although it is complex , it is quite easy to deﬁne the context of loading information that is stored along with a map in the pocket PC . The system will load the connected information , such as a restaurant’s name , nearby gas stations , or public transports that are near the point of location using a global positioning system ( GPS ) . Here , in this system , the contextual information is loaded according to the change of the ”location” . For the second possibility , which is rather diﬃcult , is to deﬁne the context that enables one to automatically switch oﬀ the user’s home electric equipment using this pocket PC when the user goes to sleep . A simple assumption that the user will go to bed after midnight could turn to disaster if the user is working late to prepare for a very important meeting in the morning . More examples of this kind of ”intelligent” context application are elaborated in [ Khedr and Karmouch , 2005 ] . The above pocket PC application examples show that the ”situation” happen - ing in a ”context” , which is lead the necessity to deﬁne the situation in order to understand the context . The ﬁrst pocket PC application example shows that the 22 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 Figure 2 . 2 : The implementation of context concept in pocket PCs situational information is loaded according to where the location is situated on the map . In the second example , the context ( must ) tried to deﬁne the situation in which the contextual action must be done . Regarding to their deﬁnition , Dey and Abowd [ 1999 ] and Dey [ 2001 ] include the term ”situation” in their deﬁnition , but unfortunately , give less attention to describing the notion of situation . McCullough [ 2001 ] deﬁned ”situation” as abili - ties connected with a setting . If this deﬁnition is combined with the third common meaning of ”context” , or ”setting conditions in which something exists or occurs” then it can understood that situations point out the context in which something exists or occurs . Meanwhile , [ Greenberg , 2001 ] noticed that the dynamic nature of context is deﬁned by situated action . However , situated action is easily con - fused by the institutionalized ( and often simplistic ) social norms that are often used to predict and prescribe all actions . The example of making the assumption that all people will sleep after midnight is an instance where institutionalized and simplistic social norms can wrongly deﬁne a situation . Context Categorization , Handling and Use in Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing Looking at the fact that the deﬁnition of context is far from reaching a consensus in this domain , viewing how plausibly researchers treat , handle and use the context 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 23 will be much more worthy to note . First of all , the dispute can be abstracted to the level of conception rather than a more complex application level . Second , as [ Gu et al . , 2005 ] said , by classifying various contexts and knowing their characteristics , it is possible to perform a context reasoning where perhaps a context conﬂict can be solved . Dourish [ 2004 ] , made a categorization based on the view of researchers of when they handle context . Based on these categories , he then made a general assump - tion . Dourish said that the context representations were inspired by the social science that falls into three major categorizations : positivist , phenomenological , and critical theories ; only positivist and phenomenological theories are relevant to context . While positivist theories are derived from the rational , empirical , and scientiﬁc tradition and , therefore , are often objective and quantitative in nature , the phenomenological theories are subjective and qualitative in orientation . In summary , positivist and phenomenological theories are not compatible . However , many researchers attempt to derive positivist responses to phenomenological ar - guments , for instance , when trying to encode and represent the context . From this point of view , such deﬁnitions of ”context” can be generalized into four as - sumptions , including the following : • context is a form of information • context is delineable • context is stable • context and activities can be separated . Dourish argued that context as a representational problem with the four listed principles above can model the sociological critiques but not the context itself . He proposed an alternative view which does not use the sociological approach . Instead of considering context as a representational problem , he considers it as an interactional problem . Instead of raising the question of ”what is context and how can it be encoded” , he questioned ”how and why , in the course of their inter - actions , do people achieve and maintain a mutual understanding of the context for their actions ? ” Those four assumptions listed above have been altered into the following assumptions : • contextuality is a relational property held between objects or activities • the scope of contextual features is deﬁned dynamically • context is occasioned property • context arising from the activity ( or content ) cannot be separated 24 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 With this assumption , Dourish altered the conception of ”context” from some - thing that describes a setting to something that people do and formed an engage - ment of those settings . This conception , although slightly diﬀerent from what Dey and Abowd [ 1999 ] and Dey [ 2001 ] proposed , still opposes the common mean - ings listed in the dictionary . The item 3 common meaning of the word ”context” would give a setting , for example , of why somebody would do this or that . How - ever , with Dourish’s conception , it will be understood that somebody does this or that because of a certain context . Moreover , Dourish claimed that users would be allowed to negotiate and evolve systems of practice and meaning in the course of their interaction with information systems , or what he called ”embodied inter - action” . Crowley et al . [ 2002 ] categorized context into a user’s and system’s context . They refer to the ”user” , using common computer science terms , as human agents . The context of which such systems should be aware is that of one or more users . In most cases , users are driven by one or more goals which can be parallel or switched from one to another . However , interacting with the system is not considered to be the goal of the user . In fact , when they use the system to archive their goals , it should be invisible to users . Crowley [ 2002 ] proposed deﬁnitions of state , task , and activity for this model . A state is deﬁned as using combinations of predicate ( or their negation ) expressions , which are functions of properties observed in the world . Actions are represented by connected states in the universe . While at any instant in time , the universe is a state called a current state , a goal state is a state where the user brings the universe to another state , requiring a sequence of actions . The association between the current state and the goal state is a task . A set of current tasks deﬁne the user’s activity , some others can be referred to as background tasks . A system’s context is composed of this model plus a model of its internal context . This composition then provides the means to observe and interpret the observations . Gu et al . [ 2005 ] classify context into two main categories : direct and indirect context . A context is classiﬁed as a direct context when it is directly acquired or obtained from an internal or external context provider . Meanwhile , indirect context is derived by interpreting direct context through context reasoning . Direct context can be classiﬁed into sensed context if it is required from physical sensors ; a direct context is classiﬁed as a deﬁned context if it is deﬁned by the user . Chalmers et al . [ 2004 ] identify the use of context or contextual information into six categories as follows : • contextual sensing , where the context is sensed , and information describes the current context • contextual augmentation , where the context is associated with data • contextual resource discovery • context triggered actions 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 25 • context mediation , where context is used to modify services • context aware presentation 2 . 3 . 2 Context in Information Science , Information Retrieval , Web Search Figure 2 . 3 : Information retrieval process [ J¨arvelin and Wilson , 2003 ] One could argue that information science , information retrieval , and information searches on the internet have one purpose , namely , to utilize the information . At the most basic level , information science should include information and data base theories , library science , documentation , information management , infor - mation processing , geographical information , etc . , and should concern gather - ing / collecting , retrieving , storing and manipulating recorded information . Most studies conducted in these ﬁelds have been used by other more speciﬁc and ap - plicable research domains , such as information retrieval and internet searches . Information retrieval concerns information - seeking based on the users’ informa - tional needs and puts the issue of how to gather the relevant information , while reducing nonrelevant information in an information query , as the central focus of the research in this ﬁeld . A web search or information search on the internet using a search engine is a kind of internet version of the original information re - trieval system , but characterized by broader and less - structured systems . It is 26 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 believed that context can play a role in creating better information manipulation and allowing the user to focus on a certain topic in order to avoid an information overﬂow . The topics division in this subsection might not satisfy everybody . For in - stance , there are many arguments for separating information seeking ( belonging to library and information science ) from information retrieval on the basis of a philosophical foundation or conversely including the knowledge aspects into these disciplines [ J¨arvelin and Wilson , 2003 ; Kuhlthau , 2005 ] . However , beside not having the nature of this literary study deeply involved in this debate , these ter - minologies are interrelated , as shown in Figure 2 . 3 of the information retrieval process . Context in Information Science According to Theodorakis et al . [ 2002 ] , ”context” in information modeling is a higher level of a conceptual entity that describes a group of conceptual entities from a particular standpoint , while the conceptual entities described can also be a context by themselves . In this terminology , a context is recognized or dis - tinguished by views or versions . For example , an information base is a context because the designer’s viewpoint is inﬂuenced by the particular needs . View schemas of an object - oriented database are also a context because they are ac - cording to the view of the creator . Workspace , where the objects are created and manipulated , is a context because the created objects are viewed according to the involved individual . Conversely , Motschig - Pitrik [ 2000 ] said that the information expression on conceptual entities that are relative to context have some criteria , including viewpoint , topic ( information items must be relevant to one or more topics ) , focus ( by ignoring the irrelevant issues in a situation ) , ( restricted ) access , varying degrees of evidence ( to describe situation ) and time slots for viewing an entity in the instance of time . Both the works of Motschig - Pitrik [ 2000 ] and Theodorakis et al . [ 2002 ] share the same goal , namely , to allow partial information on conceptual entities to be viewed from diﬀerent viewpoints and diﬀerent situations , thus allowing the decomposition of an information base into possible overlapping subsets , called ”context” , as seen in Figure 2 . 4 . They also share the same central claim , that objects can have diﬀerent names ( more then one ) or even zero names in order to handle synonymous , homonymous and anonymous objects . Using almost the same idea , Akaishi and Spyratos [ 2004 ] ; Akaishi et al . [ 2005 ] deﬁnes context as the organization of manageable subsets of the contents of an information base . If objects are contents of an information base , described by descriptors , and referred to as a certain context by references , then formally , a context is a set of triple forms : ( descriptors , objects , references ) . With this formalism , as long as the objects are identiﬁable , then the objects can belong to any context , which is almost the same concept as claimed by the two studies described above . 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 27 Figure 2 . 4 : Context in the information base [ Theodorakis et al . , 2002 ] The ”context” of this ﬁeld of research is too domain - speciﬁc and diﬀers some - what from common understandings . However , it can be understood as a ”channel of communication” between system developers , users and systems so that their viewpoints are transparent and clear to others . By showing these viewpoints as partial information or subsets of an information base’s contents , it will allow the user to personalize the collection or speed up the search for desired objects . The description of context criteria and notions , such as ”relevant” , ”focus” , ”situation” and ”viewpoint” from the research mentioned above , are very useful in recognizing or sensing an existing ”context” . Some of these notions are discussed in the ﬁeld of information science , but perhaps for the purpose of this literature study , it would be better to discuss it in the next subsection . Another important fact found in this ”context” , meaning reconstruction , is that context can be nested ; in another words , a context can explain or be made from another context . Context in an Information Retrieval and Web Search Riloﬀ and Hollaar [ 1992 ] divided information retrieval into two branches . The ﬁrst is described as the query - based retrieval task where the user formulates a query by specifying the topic of interest and typing it into the retrieval system . In return , the system will produce a ranked list of potentially relevant documents where the top item is considered the most relevant . The second branch concerns a single query that will interest one or more people during a period of time – a kind of static informational need . The sub - branches include categorization , routing and ﬁltering . Categorization automatically labels the information based on a set of predeﬁned categories . Routing systems automatically route information , based on users’ proﬁles or interests , to the corresponding user . A ﬁltering system only passes the appropriate information on to the user . For a web search , Dumais 28 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 et al . [ 2001 ] proposed another branch , which combines search results and category structures . Information retrieval communities remain focused on improving indexing and retrieval algorithms to provide ”objectively” relevant results given in an isolated query . However , more and more intentions have been put in ”context” , which is a kind of information communicated by the user to the system in order to allow the system to better respond to the user’s informational needs [ Anick and Vaithyanathan , 1997 ; Budzik et al . , 2001 ] . This information communication band - width between user and system could be increased by improving a user’s experi - ence with the accessed information . One example of this is [ Kiyoki et al . , 1994 ] which deﬁne context as user’s impression and the content of the information . In order to extract the appropriate information according to the user’s impression and the information contents , a method called mathematical model of meaning ( MMM ) realizes the semantic associative search by giving context words . This way , users use their own words for representing impression and information con - tents for information retrieval , and do not need to know how the information of retrieval candidates are characterized in database . Kari and Savolainen [ 2007 ] deﬁne context as all those things which are not an inherent part of information phenomena , but which nevertheless bear some relation to these . One fundamental attribute of context in information seeking is referred to as time [ Savolainen , 2006 ] , and then the concept of ”situation” in information seeking emerged . Dourish et al . [ 1993 ] refers to context as a set of practices for retrieving and evaluating information . These experiences and practices could guide the infor - mation interpretation , because interpretation must be interpreted and decided by users when retrieved and could lead to the understanding of what is ”relevant” . Saracevic [ 1975 ] divides relevance into three categories , as depicted in Fig - ure 2 . 5 . Topical relevance is easy to implement , as judgment is decided by prede - ﬁned categories . The other two are diﬃcult to implement without strong support from artiﬁcial intelligence and psychology . Motivational relevance is diﬃcult to implement because it should sense user motivation and relate this sense to the user information seeking process . Interpretational relevance is more diﬃcult because it must consider all context properties , such as situations , focus , time instances , and the user . 2 . 3 . 3 Context in Design The ”context” jargon has also been widely used in design domains . But , as the de - sign itself is not a monolithic discipline , the context terminology may vary for each design sub - domain . In the next subsection , ”context” use will be discussed from an architectural / building and urban design , software design , industrial / consumer product design , and mechanical engineering design points of view . It is assumed that these four design sub - domains will represent the diﬀering emphases and com - mon senses of the design domain . Furthermore , with the exception of software 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 29 Figure 2 . 5 : Relevance [ Saracevic , 1975 ] design , the other three technical areas are very much assisted by computer - aided design . There has been a paradigm shift in computer - aided design from being just a drawing tool to a design representation in which is involved some aspect of design , including the ’design context’ . For this reason , this survey will include one of these design contexts , the ”shape context” . Context in Architecture / Building and Urban Design Looking for the meaning of ”context” in architecture and urban design sources can be considered diﬃcult , not only because this word has been widely used among researchers and practitioners of this domain without a clear deﬁnition , but also because a lot of new context - related idioms have emerged . In this survey , the deﬁnition of context was not found in any architecture dictionary , such as [ Hoshino , 1978 ] and [ Burden , 2002 ] . The most probable reason behind this is that the term ”context” is assumed to be understood . In fact , most of these deﬁnitions are understood as the meaning of item 2 and item 3 of the common meaning of ”context” . For instance , ”historical context” can be interpreted by one who does not have an architectural background , simply as an architectural or urban connection with a historical background , or the architecture of a building that is set and interrelated with a historical background . The fact that ”context” is ill - deﬁned and left to be interpreted by the reader creates a mess of context - related idioms that have been found in [ de Jong and van der Voordt , 2002 ; Franklin , 1998 ; Stellingwerﬀ , 2005 ; Talen , 2006 ; Unwin , 30 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 Figure 2 . 6 : Fitting , responding , and mediating an architecture to its surroundings [ Bur - den , 2002 ] 2003 ; Warren et al . , 1998 ] and many others architecture reading sources , possibly leaving readers confused . The approach that has been used to reconstruct the meaning of context in this sub - design domain explores the meaning of ”contex - tual” and ”contextualism” , as these two terminologies are well - deﬁned derivatives of context terminologies in [ Burden , 2002 ] . The meaning of “contextual” is any doctrine emphasizing the importance of the context in establishing the meaning of terms , such as the setting into which a building is placed , its site , its natural environment or its neighborhood . Meanwhile , contextualism is deﬁned as an ap - proach to urban planning ( 1960 - 1970 ) that considers the city in its totality , and the view that the experiences of a city are greater than the sum of its parts ; all architecture must ﬁt into , respond to , and mediate its surroundings . From those two deﬁnitions , ”context” obviously plays a role in establishing the relationship between an object of architectural or urban design work ( which has primary basic architecture elements , i . e . , the ground , space , gravity , light and time [ Unwin , 2003 ] ) and its surroundings , while it also becomes a frame of reference to totally harmonize these relationships . Therefore , once a design features a location or place , it has a material context ( spatial , ecological , or technical ) , a social context ( historic or historical , cultural , or political ) , and a practical context ( organizational , operational , or intersubjective ) [ Franklin , 1998 ] and [ de Jong and van Duin , 2002 ] . Since these contexts are changing , a designer should anticipate the future of a context . One way to do so is to write down information via physical or digital means and translate the design ideas and sketches into a so - called ”virtual context” that allows designers to ’foresee’ what may come in the future [ Stellingwerﬀ , 2005 ] . 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 31 ( a ) Dome of Rock , Palestine ( b ) Royal Mosque Kotobaru , Riau , In - donesia ( c ) Al Azhar , Cairo , Egypt ( d ) Blue Mosque , Istanbul , Turkey Figure 2 . 7 : Islamic architecture , ( source : private documentations ) As quoted in [ Stellingwerﬀ , 2005 ] , Ranulph Glanville said ’Design is ( like ) a conversation’ . The designer and user or owner are communicating the architec - tural work or artifacts through the contexts . A designer puts all of the components and concepts of his or her architectural work into contexts [ de Jong and Rose - mann , 2002 ] , while the user or owner interprets the architecture using the context [ M´acˇel , 2002 ] . The designer can scale the intensity of the context in his architec - tural work , while the user can distinguish the architectural work on its contextual scale . Figure 2 . 7 shows that Islamic architecture shares common senses but diﬀers in material and social context scales . Context in Software Design The term ”context” appeared in the software design domain not long ago . Perry [ 1994 ] , mentioned ”context” as something that needed to be considered during the building of software , including architectural ( size , product type , product ap - proach , and level of process maturity ) , organizational and social contexts . This understanding is closer to item 3 of the common understanding of ”context” , and establishes that the software development process is set and interrelated with such conditions . In the same year , Holtzblatt introduced the idiom of ”contex - 32 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 ( a ) Flow Model ( b ) Aﬃnity diagram ( c ) Consolidated ﬂow model ( d ) Storyboard Figure 2 . 8 : Contextual design methodology [ Beyer and Holtzblatt , 1998 ] tual technique” in software design in [ Holtzblatt , 1994 ] . Along with Beyer , she then gradually developed a software design methodology of so - called ”contextual design” which is now widely used . ”Contextual design” deals with the issues of data gathering , driving design , and managing the team and organization con - text [ Beyer and Holtzblatt , 1998 ] . It is an approach of designing products directly from a designer’s understanding of how the customer works [ Beyer and Holtzblatt , 1999 ] . Although the term context is not well - deﬁned , this methodology aims at the results of such software development and is set in the user’s context ( not only requirements , but also culture , policy and vision ) . It seems that Holtzblatt and Beyer combined some known techniques in software design and other tech - niques from design science in their user - centered software design methodology , as can be seen in Figure 2 . 8 . Aﬃnity diagrams and storyboard are two well - known techniques that allow the user to express his or her experiences and wishes for a product , and analyze the results respectively . Later on , more speciﬁc context deﬁnitions in this domain are found by Evans [ 2004 ] . In the introduction of the concept , Evans described how important context is among developers , users and experts and how diﬃcult it can be to represent and share . A context is deﬁned as the setting in which a word or statement ap - 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 33 Figure 2 . 9 : Navigation map [ Evans , 2004 ] pears that determines its meaning . Several contexts are bound to give a clear and shared understanding of what is consistent and what can independently develop for teams members . The relationship and their model between certain bound contexts involved in a project are represented in a context map depicted in Fig - ure 2 . 9 . In this case , Evans not only adopted the ”context” terminology from the common English understanding , but also directly from the Latin understanding , namely , the state of being joined , ( e . g . logical connection ) of contextus . Context in Human - Centered Software Design The International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) provides guidance on human - centered design activities throughout the life cycle of computer - based in - teractive systems known as ISO13407 - 1999 [ ISO13407 , 1999 ] . One factor that is emphasized in this standard is usability and to what extent a product ( software ) can be used by speciﬁed users to achieve speciﬁed goals with eﬀectiveness , eﬃ - ciency and satisfaction in a speciﬁed context of use [ ISO9241 - 11 , 1998 ] . Related to this , ISO9241 - 11 deﬁnes the context of use , user , and task respectively . The ”context of use” is deﬁned in ISO9241 - 11 as users , tasks , and equipment ( hard - ware , software and materials ) and the physical and social environments in which a product is used . Meanwhile , ISO / IEC FDIS 9126 - 1 ( ”Software product qual - ity - Part 1 : Quality model” ) proposes a software quality model [ Bevan , 2000 ] and deﬁnes usability as the capability of the software product to be understood , learned , used and attractive to the user under speciﬁed conditions . The use of use under speciﬁed conditions phrase makes it clear that quality is not an absolute property , but depends on the context of use [ Bevan , 1999 ] . 34 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 From those two related deﬁnitions , the meaning of ”context” in ”context of use” terminology refers to item 3 of the common understanding of ”context” , thus can be interpreted as an interrelated condition in which the quality of software can be measured . However , the deﬁnition in ISO9241 - 11 is considered an ambiguous deﬁnition , since it mixes up the actors ( users and equipments ) , factors ( tasks ) , and conditions ( physical and social environments ) . Otherwise , this deﬁnition tends to explicitly emphasize that the quality of software can only be measured when actors , factors and conditions are placed together as a whole in one setting . Context in Consumer Product / Industrial Design The two approaches listed above have been used in order to reconstruct the mean - ing of ”context” in two branches of design . In this subsection , in order the under - standing of ”context” in this ﬁeld , a theory called degree of product - user relation - ships was developed and proposed . This theory was adopted from product levels description in [ Hekkert and van Dijk , 2001 ] and theory of entity - relationship from [ Chen , 1976 , 2002 ] Degree of Product - user Relationship In the ﬁrst degree , the product is understood as an artifact . It is merely the shape , materials , form , colors , aesthetics , list of functions and other quantiﬁable characteristics . In the second degree of the relationship , a product is related to a user by how the user experiences ( uses , feels , sees , and judges ) and understands it , or how the product aﬀects the user ( i . e . lifts the user’s prestige , gives the user comfort or pushes the user to think ) . Finally , at the third degree of the product - user relationship , the second degree user - product relationship is put , ﬁtted and derived into a certain related list of facts , for example , as social , economical , political , environmental , cultural , etc . , as depicted in Figure 2 . 10 . By adopting the basic theory of entity - relationship , the user - product relation - ship degrees mentioned above can be described mathematically . Initially , the product itself ( no relationship with the user or ﬁrst degree of relationship ) is symbolized in the following formula : f : P i → A i ( 2 . 1 ) A product ( P ) can be seen as an entity , which has several attributes ( A ) , such as shape , form , material , aesthetics , and so on , and can therefore be detailed in the following formula : f : P i → A i 1 X A i 2 . . . X A i n ( 2 . 2 ) where X denotes the Cartesian product . The users or human beings – which are not easily mathematically described – can be seen by all factors ( B ) as making decisions , judgements , using senses , 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 35 First degree Second degree Third degree Figure 2 . 10 : Degree of product - user relationship positions , etc . , using cultural backgrounds , religious or faith backgrounds , tacit knowledge , political views , hobbies , understandings , experiences , etc . In a simple formula , the user is a function of these factors . f : U i → B i ( 2 . 3 ) f : U i → B i 1 X B i 2 . . . X B i n ( 2 . 4 ) Furthermore , the product - user relationship as such ( the second degree of re - lationship ) or r i for a particular product with a particular user ( U ) is a cartesian product of a product’s attributes and user’s human factors that describe a unique user - product relationship , such as ”LIKE” , ”DISLIKE” , and ”COMFORT” , as an element of a set of relationships R . r i ⊂ A X B ( 2 . 5 ) Where R = { r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r n } ( 2 . 6 ) An R or set of all particular relationships between a speciﬁc user and a speciﬁc product will describe the user’s experiences with a particular product . It seems 36 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 R will allow the user to have the product ( to use it again in the future ) or not . However , there are factors ( C ) outside of this relationship that can not only change or inﬂuence the user’s decisions or experiences with a particular product as mentioned above , but can also change or inﬂuence the product development and thus , the product’s attributes . These factors are time sensitive and can change from time - to - time . Therefore , these factors are a function of time C → C ( t ) . If c 1 , c 1 , . . . c n , are the selected factors of time t that can potentially inﬂuence the product , the user and their relationships , then c t 1 , c t 2 , . . . c t n ⊂ C ( 2 . 7 ) At the end , the third degree product - user relationship ( E ) can be described as E = { R , c t i } ( 2 . 8 ) ”Context” in a Successful Product Development Figure 2 . 11 : Over the wall production steps [ Rembold et al . , 1993 ] Traditionally , product development is understood as consisting of several isolated activities . With this old - fashioned understanding , product development is seen as an ”over - the - wall” transformation , as illustrated in Figure 2 . 11 . Therefore , by these means , design is often simply a plan for an object to be built later , leaving designers to believe that their role only produces objects [ Mitchell , 2001 ] . In the early 1990’s , this view radically changed to include more integrated product de - velopment [ Jambak , 2000 ] . However , – refer to a successful product development – although now more and more designers develop a product more integrally , but many designers’ visions are still disconnected from the users’ needs , which is in contrast to the fact that design is central to the human experience [ Hekkert et al . , 2000 ; Heskett , 2003 ; Hummels and Overbeeke , 2000 ; Mattelm¨aki , 2005 ; van Rompay et al . , 2005 ] . This common mistake ( which becomes a common design failure ) will be taken as a starting point to reconstruct the meaning of ”context” in product development in the ﬁeld of consumer product / industrial design . The 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 37 common understanding of ”context” and the proposed degree of user - product relationship theory will be used as a means for this purpose . Mitchell [ 2001 ] claims that designers often pay more attention to the style of design rather than responding to the actual context in which the design will be situated . Paradoxically , it is also deﬁnitely beyond a designer’s ability to anticipate and respond to all complexities of context . Hummels and Overbeeke [ 2000 ] and Mattelm¨aki [ 2005 ] proposed shifting the design from creating products , improving usability and addressing ergonomic problems to experiences . Here , Hummels and Overbeeke [ 2000 ] proposed ”context for experience” as possibilities for a user to do things , gain knowledge and be aﬀected in some way , depending on the intentions of the user and the situation in which the event occurred . To this point , ”context” can be easily understood as a set of conditions ( item 3 of the common understanding of ”context” ) about which a designer should be concerned during the design process or conditions with which he or she should be connected and aware . From the user - product relationship degree point of view , they are suggesting moving from the ﬁrst degree ( isolated product concern ) to the second degree ( where the user - product relationships are included ) . However , the presentation of some terms , such as ”experience” , ”use” , and ”possibilities” in the ”context for experience” needs further clariﬁcation . Before that , the term ”context” , as deﬁned by industrial designers , will ﬁrst be discussed . Hekkert and van Dijk [ 2001 ] and Sleeswijk Visser et al . [ 2005 ] deﬁne ”context” as all ( implicit and explicit ) factors selected and combined by designers that in - ﬂuence the experience of product use . This deﬁnition promotes the ”context for experience” from the second degree to the third degree of user - product relation - ship , bringing in interactions with other possible factors that could inﬂuence the original ”context for experience” when a product is used . Although this deﬁni - tion does not explicitly mention conditions , backgrounds , and settings , the term ”experience” implicitly contains those three meanings . Therefore , one could say that this deﬁnition is close to item 3 of the common understanding of ”context” . Theoretically , the above deﬁnition of ”context” is adequate enough to explain the user , product , and the ( in a very broad sense ) environment as it ﬁts the generalization of the third degree of a user - product relationship . However , this deﬁnition makes the ”context” unlimited , as depicted in Figure 2 . 12 . Since the deﬁnition of this context is unlimited , it is then beyond the ability of a designer to handle it and is known as the paradox mentioned by Mitchell [ 2001 ] . Moreover , this deﬁnition of context overlaps with the design notion itself if design is under - stood as compromising the whole factor of design in a balanced and comprehensive way . Glock [ 2001 ] distinguishes between the contexts and the collection of require - ments and design factors by invoking these collections with certain contexts , such as context of use , context of production , and context of maintenance . In other words , context is an understanding - enriched collection of requirements and design factors . Unlike the traditional design solution , the selection of design factors is driven by a design problem , and context factors are not obviously related to the 38 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 Figure 2 . 12 : Onionskin and layer models of context [ Stappers and Sleeswijk Visser , 2006 ] problem domain but rather the commitment of a strategy [ Hekkert and van Dijk , 2001 ] . These two statements impose at least three implications in understand - ing the meaning of ”context” . First , there is the intention of designers to select certain design factors in order to invoke certain contexts . Second , there is an interconnected judgement process involving a factor selection . Third , one should predict or be sure ( rationally or intuitively ) of their predictable expectations when a selection has been made . Unlike human - centered software design domains that clearly state that context is not the property of a product but rather a tool to measure the usability of a product , from this literature study it can be conclude that industrial designers do not have that position ( for example , see : [ Hekkert and van Dijk , 2001 ; Hummels and Overbeeke , 2000 ] ) . However , measuring and simulating these contexts ( e . g . context for experiences or context of use ) as properties of a product is diﬃcult . In fact , current design support software packages do not yet cover modeling and forecasting product use that make designers anticipate various use circumstances in order to develop a successful product [ van der Vegte and Horv´ath , 2002 ] . Nev - ertheless , if designers use their intentions of invoking a certain context , then later judge their position and boundaries of the intended context as a setting of product development , this context will most likely play a big role as a factor in successful product development . Using an example , when a team of designers has chosen , based on their judgment , certain ”possible experiences” that the users might have for their imminent product , they can use this shared understanding in product development . This understanding acts as a reference when they choose certain requirements and when they deﬁne design problems , and acts as a boundary to certain solutions previously proposed . This understanding might also act as an ”interpreter” to avoid ambiguity in communication ( i . e . during the brain - storming session ) . 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 39 ( a ) Process and involvement ( b ) Data collection techniques ( c ) Preparatory diagram ( d ) Data analyze Figure 2 . 13 : Contextmapping methodology , ( source : [ Sleeswijk Visser et al . , 2005 ] and private documentation ) Sleeswijk Visser et al . [ 2005 ] introduced a method to collect and represent possible users’ experiences called ”contextmapping” . This method was motivated by the fact that many designers face diﬃculties in designing ( or re - designing ) a product based on just numbers and graphs provided by R & D and marketing departments . Designers receive few clues of what users really expect of such products . Contextmapping comprises methodology in collecting information that inﬂuences a user’s experience with such products and a means of communicating this information among design team members ( which can be educated designers , engineers , marketers , managers , etc . ) , contextually depicted in Figure 2 . 13 . This concept brings an enormous potential contribution to the design sciences , espe - cially to the user - centered design and design for experience . Nevertheless , this approach operates on the paradox mentioned by Dourish [ 2004 ] , as they combine the positivist and phenomenological theories . During the observation or data collection , the positivist rationale is used in actions such as objectivity , individ - ual uniqueness , and the reduction of complexity . However , during analysis , the phenomenological rationale , such as subjectivity and qualitatively , are used , espe - cially when the results of the observation being analyzed are overwhelming . This way , the context might be recognized or indicated , but reducing the objectivity during the analysis , might lead one to question the end results . 40 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 Context in Mechanical and Other Engineering Design Gomes et al . [ 2001 ] classiﬁed design as routine and non - routine . A design is classiﬁed as routine when all of the needed knowledge for the mapping process is available to the designer ; in other words , it is an instance of known designs . Meanwhile , a non - routine design is classiﬁed when some of the knowledge for the mapping process is missing . A subclass of this non - routine classiﬁcation is an innovative design , whereas the lack of knowledge is located in the structural space . Otherwise , if the knowledge is missing in all spaces , it is called creative design . When innovative design gives new values to the design variables that are not commonly used in previous designs , the creative design extends the known design space by creating a new class of artifacts . Unlike the industrial design , described in the previous section , that can most likely be classiﬁed into innovative or creative designs , mechanical and other engi - neering designs heavily reuse the knowledge from previous design activities and can be classiﬁed as routine , or a partially innovative design . Over 60 % of the mechanical - design activity in industries reuse existing mechanical designs [ Bar - dasz and Zeid , 1992 ] . Mechanical and other engineering designs can also be seen as an activity of intensive manipulation of knowledge that forms from the establish - ment of complex associative relations , such as functional and topological , among diﬀerent design object or entities for each considerated problem [ Dentsoras , 2005 ] . Therefore , storing the design cases generated while solving design problems , and retrieving those applicable for new design problems context in a knowledge base ( a machine - readable resource for the dissemination of information ) or knowledge management system ( integral knowledge base that includes resources , documents , people and skills ) , is of paramount importance [ Bardasz and Zeid , 1992 ] . Further - more , Bardasz and Zeid [ 1992 ] argued that in most cases , it is more eﬀective to modify the design process and create a mechanical artifact , rather than modify the mechanical artifact itself . Many types and approaches of knowledge - based or knowledge management systems have been proposed to store or retrieve design knowledge , i . e . knowledge indexing [ Ahmed , 2005 ] . However , Bardasz and Zeid [ 1992 ] ; Clarkson and Hamil - ton [ 2000 ] ; Dentsoras [ 2005 ] argued that storing and retrieving knowledge is not as easy as doing the same to information . Some problems that can be listed include the following : it is not always easy to form and structure knowledge , since it is usually expressed dynamically and is complicated ; it is not easy to capture the design process ; it is not easy to verbalize human knowledge ; it is not easy to make a generalization and at the same time distinguish each case or event individually in order to make knowledge storing eﬃcient as well applying retrieved knowledge . The understanding of the meaning of ”context” in this area will be approached from the mechanical / engineering knowledge utilization problems mentioned above . According to Clarkson and Hamilton [ 2000 ] , although knowledge has been sys - temized in a well - structured way , those systems still cannot do what an expert can do , namely , understand which piece of knowledge may be applied and pre - 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 41 dict the likely consequences of applying particular knowledge . Above this stored knowledge , there is a knowledge about knowledge , referred to as meta - knowledge . This meta - knowledge , in a broader sense , plays a role in eliciting knowledge from other sources , including human experts , textbooks , work ﬁles , and previous cases . In their proposed system , retrieved knowledge describes the speciﬁc method to be used to perform a task , and coupled with the meta - knowledge , describes the ”context” . At this point , ”context” can be understood as a condition or setting where pieces of speciﬁc knowledge can be applied with a predictable consequence . Referring to the three common understandings of ”context” in the dictionary , it can be argued that this understanding is closer to the third meaning . However , as meta - knowledge actually plays a ”context” role , namely , connects pieces of knowledge , it can also be understood as ”context” from the latin root contextus , meaning ”action of weaving or joining together . ” ( a ) Contexts ( b ) Contexts Relationship ( - - - - : re - lationship ) Figure 2 . 14 : Contexts and their relationships [ Bardasz and Zeid , 1992 ] Bardasz and Zeid [ 1992 ] proposed the use of a memory model to store and retrieve mechanical design knowledge , based on certain accessible contexts , which is analogically designed to solve problems . A context comprises events that cor - respond to design plans for mechanical artifacts , for example , product context , assemblies context , ( mechanical ) component context , and recurring engineering context , as depicted in Figure 2 . 14 . From this fact , it can be argued that the mean - ing of ”context” is a division of knowledge , allowing a user of that knowledge to focus on a particular mechanical design plan while retrieving the best - case sce - nario for his design problem , and store cases of solved design problems eﬃciently . This understanding seems a bit far from the common understanding found in the dictionary . However , this understanding is close to some deﬁnitions of the latin root contextus , including the followings : 42 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 3 1 . joining together 2 . the state of being joined , ( e . g . logical connection , coherent ) 3 . an ordered plan 4 . constructed or structured 5 . a whole made up of numerous parts and complexes There are two claims from Bardasz and Zeid [ 1992 ] work which are interesting to be reviewed . First , they claim that these contexts can determine a minimally relevant set of featured types to describe an event . Fundamentally , a context can be recognized when there is a relationship . However , since mechanical and engineering design problems are established from relationships among diﬀerent design objects or entities , such as features , shapes and assemblies , these pieces of the relationship might hinder the focus of such design plans . Reducing or minimizing the relevance makes such contexts and focuses or goals of such plans easier to identify . Bardasz and Zeid [ 1992 ] also claimed that this memory model grows with the designer when more and more design problems are presented and solved . As this memory model can be seen at a higher level of context , it can be said that context also grows when knowledge grows . Shape Context in Product Modeling Shape is of primary concern in product modeling . For companies , the shape of their products reﬂects their brand and vision . One example of this is the auto - motive domain . Although they gradually keep changing their product shape – to show their customers that they are innovative and technologically high - ended – they still keep the new shape in context of their brand . Figure 2 . 15 shows the diﬀerent types of shapes and series of products that are contextually linked to the producer’s brand and speciﬁc series . A radical change would set their brand at risk . In this case , a shape context can be understood as a limitation of shape changing to keep a tight relationship between a user or customer [ Vergeest and Jambak , 2007 ] . Therefore , the meaning of ”context” in this context can be un - derstood as a setting or background where a particular shape could exist ; this is closer to the third common meaning listed in the dictionaries . However , for each change in shape or modiﬁcation that refers to a certain product brand , it can be said that these tasks are in connection with a certain brand image . Hence , it can also be stated that this kind of context refers to the second common understanding in the dictionaries . Another understanding of ’context’ in this domain is a creation or control over the shape in product modeling . In order to eﬀectively control the shape , one must have the proper shape context in place [ Dumitrescu et al . , 2005 ] . In this case , context functions as the cancellation ( or hiding ) of degrees – of – freedom parameters that are not relevant to the current modeling task [ Vergeest , 2001 ] . 2 . 3 CONTEXT IN VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND APPLICATIONS 43 Series ↓ Models Figure 2 . 15 : Series of models of BMW products , www . bmw . com Conversely , according to Vergeest [ 2001 ] , context can be understood as the set of parameters that are relevant to the current modeling task . He also deﬁned parameter as anything that can be changed or controlled by the designer in order to perform his or her task . This could include a numerical variable or a proﬁle curve . Meanwhile , a task is deﬁned as the creation or modiﬁcation of a shape . This deﬁnition of ”context” also applies to the ﬁrst deﬁnition above ( for instance , in the case of BMW products ) if the set of parameters are understood as something limiting shape modiﬁcation and the term ”relevant” is according to the products’s brand - customer relationship . Vergeest [ 2001 ] and Dumitrescu [ 2007 ] characterized shape context as the fol - lowing : • shape context relates to degrees of freedom , or parameters , or shape handles . In general , it is connected to those aspects that can ( or need to ) be changed • shape context is dynamic ; it depends on time to determine whether a par - ticular shape aspect is or is not relevant ; therefore , it cannot be assumed that shape context is static • shape context is related to the current design intent . As far as shape is concerned , design intent can be circumscribed as the set of shapes that would satisfy the constraints It can be concluded that a shape context is a ﬁnite collection of shape vari - ation procedures where each shape variation procedure is governed by a multi - component parameter and can be formalized by its implications to the shape 44 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 4 domain 2 R 3 . A shape context C , C = { M 1 , . . . , M n } , is a set of mappings , n ≥ 0 , where each mapping takes the form M i : ( 2 R 3 × P i ) −→ 2 R 3 ( 2 . 9 ) where P i , called the parameter domain of M i , can be any set . M i transforms a shape S into a diﬀerent ( or possibly the same ) shape S 0 , depending on the parameter value p ∈ P i . For a given shape S ⊂ R 3 , the set I i ( S ) = { M i ( S , p ) | p ∈ P i } is called the image of S through M i . I i ( S ) is a family of shapes , possiblly including S itself . The union of all images through M i , denoted as R ( S ) is the range of the shape context relative to S : R ( S ) = S i = 1 , n I i ( S ) . In order to describe a process that takes place during a ﬁnite time interval , time dependency must be taken into account and the shape context equation must be generalized into the following : C ( t ) = [ i = K ( t ) M i ( 2 . 10 ) where t ∈ [ t 0 , t 1 ] denotes the time interval considered and K ( t ) ⊆ { 1 , . . . , n } is a selection function from n indices . The set { M 1 , . . . , M n } contains all mappings that occur in context C ( t ) for at least one value t ∈ [ t 0 , t 1 ] . To summarize , for any t in a time interval [ t 0 , t 1 ] , C ( t ) speciﬁes zero or more ‘active’ mappings ; each mapping speciﬁes a shape , or a ‘space’ of shape variations , controlled by a ( multi – component ) parameter . 2 . 4 Summarizing Remarks on ”Context” After collecting the deﬁnitions of context from three popular English dictionaries , this survey suggests three common understandings of ”context” in daily life . Prior to doing this , a study on Latin words , from where the English word ”context” was borrowed , have been studied . The three daily common understandings of ”con - text” have been suggested considering the Latin words and these understandings have been used to reconstruct the meaning of ”context” in various domains and applications . Not surprisingly , a consensus on ”context” has not been found . Even in some areas of research , the understanding of this word has been sharply polarized . Moreover , the deﬁnition of this word has been extended with an ad hoc deﬁnition for the purpose of a speciﬁc study , research , or application . What is a surprising ﬁnding in this study is that the word ”context” can be used very ﬂexibly in each domain and can still be accepted as a true deﬁnition , even if it is very much the opposite from not only other domains or applications but also from the daily common understanding . Two examples that can be drawn here are from pervasive computing and mechanical engineering design domains . In one common understanding , ”context” explains why something happens or why an object does a certain activity ; ”context” more or less deﬁnes a situation . 2 . 4 SUMMARIZING REMARKS ON ”CONTEXT” 45 However , in pervasive computing , ”context” is an object or activity explaining a situation where , based on this situation , computers can do a certain task . In this case ( or in context of this research domain ) , an object or activity becomes contextual information as an input for a computation process . In daily life , people can ﬁnd the application of this ”opposite” concept in an automatic door . The door will open or not according to the results of such computation processes where the input of this process is the identiﬁed object ( a person ) standing before the door . It is widely accepted that context is about relationships . The more relation - ships that are included , the more a context is clearly understood . However , in mechanical or engineering design , where a component is deﬁned by feature rela - tionships , an assembly is deﬁned by component relationships , and a product is deﬁned by assembly component relationships , a context can be deﬁned by reduc - ing these relationships until it is clear to the user on what certain design task or plan he or she can focus . Although this is opposite other domains in deﬁning a context , without reducing relationships , a context in mechanical and engineering designs might not be easily recognized . In the same spirit , reducing the proper - ties of ”context” has also been enacted in order to realize the implementation of context - aware application systems in pervasive computing . In general , the existence of context can be recognized or deﬁned by recog - nizing or deﬁning its properties : relevance , focus , situations and other heritage tasks . Relevance is deﬁned by judgement and produces a list of relevant contents . To focus on a certain context , one must be aware of or sensitive about goals , motivation and current issues . An object can be said to leave a context when its focus is changing . A situation describes a context and thus deﬁnes a con - text . Inspired by the human capability to handle contexts , studies have diﬀerent attitudes , strategies , and representations of context , for instance , the human ca - pability to understand an incomplete , implicit , or ambiguous sentence . Humans are also able to understand a goal or meaning without being verbally instructed , and of course , are capable of interpreting words , situations , conditions or phenom - ena . From this literature study , it can be generalized that there are two attitudes and two strategies of researchers towards ”context” . Some researchers , in order to understand and utilize context , tend to describe the properties of context . Understanding what the mechanisms are and how are they run processes is a kind of challenge . For instance , what is relevance ? How have judgments been made to satisfy relevance ? How does one sense a focus when a user or system can come or leave a focus ? How does one describe a situation in such a context , or viz versa ? What is the boundary of context ? And so on . It can be speculated that these attitudes are very much inﬂuenced by the research in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence ( that , in fact , is one of the ﬁrst research domains concerned about context ) and end up in a strategy of creating an intelligent context , which tends to replace or artiﬁce human capabilities to make a judgement , or sense a focus , situation , or interpretation . Huge challenges must still be overcome in order to formulate and describe a context in a complete 46 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 5 portrayal . Other groups of researchers recognize the phenomena of existing context and tend to facilitate utilizing the context . This way , they face less diﬃculties in describing a context . This attitude is deployed in the strategy assisting users ( that could be a human being ) to develop ( or recognize ) and utilize context , including acting as a human - computer ( or system ) channel of communication . The next section will describe context and the strategy in utilizing context in this thesis . 2 . 5 Context in this Thesis : Problem Statement Revisited As described in chapter 1 , it is well - known that designers face many problems in conceptual design due to characteristics of ill - deﬁned design problems and vague design concepts . This problem also aﬀects the formulation of designer’s informa - tional needs into information queries because the informational need is ill - deﬁned as well . Analogically , how designers use internet search engines during this design phase is like a man in a dark tunnel searching for a light . Although such algorithm improvements and better predeﬁne categories are good , it would be in the best interest of designers to help designers who have already found the light , namely those who know what to ﬁnd . What is important in helping designers during this search in the dark tunnel include the following : • Assistance in recording and connecting every step he or she made in order to ﬁnd the light . Designers need assistance connecting each single isolated search process using an existing search engine . • Assistance in tracing every step he or she made to revise or reevaluate his or her previous judgements . Designers need assistance in recording every query he or she made in order to revisit judgments . • Assistance in marking each connected step of his or her endeavor to ﬁnd the light . Designers need to group these queries so that he or she can recognize his or her focus and any attempt in ﬁnding a design solution , concept , or idea . • Assistance in recording the experience of walking in the dark tunnel . Design - ers need to personalize their information search processes and systematically construct them according to their design projects . From this literature study , three deﬁnitions of context that plausibly to support designers in situation described in four items above were made . Following each of these context deﬁnitions , are the reformulated problem deﬁnitions . Furthermore , based on these three deﬁnitions , ”context knowledge” is deﬁned . 2 . 5 CONTEXT IN THIS THESIS : PROBLEM STATEMENT REVISITED 47 Context deﬁnition 1 . • Context includes interconnected search term ( s ) and relevant results in in - formation search processes using internet search engines . • Context is a record of ( interconnected ) search term ( s ) and relevant results according to users’ design projects . Problem deﬁnition 1 . • How to personalize internet information search processes ? • How to compartmentalize these processes according to design projects ? • How to connect these isolated queries ? • How to record ( bookmark ) both search term ( s ) and relevant results Context deﬁnition 2 . Facts : Design knowledge and information are not limited to only the internet . This knowledge or information may come from experts , books , patents , brain - storming notes , design tasks , design sketches , etc . Designers use multi - resource knowledge and information for speciﬁc design tasks and design problem - solving cases . Therefore , although designers have abundant knowledge and information resources , it is necessary to bring these applications together to solve a speciﬁc design problem . In daily life , a designer will search for information on the internet , print it , and put it in a design project folder , along with other notes , photocopies , drawings , sketches , etc . Therefore , context is interconnected search terms , relevant results , and other user’s ( digital ) documents in a speciﬁc focus . Problem deﬁnition 2 . How does one include user’s ( digital ) documents into a search process ? 48 THE CHAOS OF CONTEXT : A MEANING RECONSTRUCTION SURVEY 2 . 6 Context deﬁnition 3 . Facts : Information search processes are inclusive in a design process . There - fore , the capability and expertise of designers inﬂuence signiﬁcant fac - tors of good informational needs . Keeping or recording information search processes will open opportunities to keep or store designers’ knowledge that traditionally was diﬃcult to do because of the diﬃ - culties verbalizing designers’ knowledge from their mind . In daily life , especially in collaboration design projects , designers need to share their understanding with others . How can they can exchange their informa - tion search results at the same level of understanding ? Therefore , context is interconnected with search terms , relevant results , and other user’s ( digital ) documents that explicitly and visible to other designers and trans - ferable . Problem deﬁnition 3 . How to make a deﬁned context transferable ? Context Knowledge deﬁnition . From the three context deﬁnitions above , the then context - knowledge can be deﬁned as : • Knowledge of knowing interrelated ( information ) search processes • Knowledge about interrelated knowledge and information sources and how to retrieve them for a speciﬁc purpose . 2 . 6 Concluding Remarks This literature study reported the reconstruction the meaning of ”context” . Dif - ferent approaches have been used to introduce the concept of ”context” in each domain . For the industrial design domain , where this research project attempts to support the designers , the concept of ”context” was introduced using the degree of product - user relationship theory . At the end of this meaning reconstruction , summarizing remarks have been made and the problem statement , deﬁned in the chapter 1 , has been revisited , where the understanding of ”context” derived from this literature study is central to reformulating the problem deﬁnition . From this literature study , approaches to recognize or to indicate the ”context” were found . One of these approaches , that is indicating the existence of context by the change of ”focus” was used during the empirical study of context knowledge in design practice and reported in next chapter . The proposed context deﬁnitions for this thesis , are detailed and implemented in chapter 4 . Chapter 3 The Study of Context Knowledge in Design Practice 1 ”Your theory is crazy , but it’s not crazy enough to be true . ” Niels Bohr 3 . 1 Introduction In chapter 2 , the deﬁnition and the concept of ”context” in many research ﬁelds has been studied . In order to ensure that the upcoming system can be helpful and useful for the designer , a study on the data of an experiment that reﬂects the practice of product engineering design has been completed . The assumption is that if the ”context” in design practice can be understood , there is a greater chance of having a helpful and useful support system closer to the nature of the design process . For this purpose , data from the so - called D 1 experiment of the Desys project [ van Breemen , 1996 ] were used in this study . This chapter reports the results of that study . Desys was a research project conducted at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology . It investigated the role of information in the early phase of the product development process [ van Breemen , 1996 ] . The Desys project aimed at developing tools that supported conceptual design activities . In order to have a computerized conceptual supporting tool , the requirements of such a computer system were gathered through an empirical observation of the design process . 1 adopted from Jambak and Vergeest [ 2004 ] 49 50 THE STUDY OF CONTEXT KNOWLEDGE IN DESIGN PRACTICE 1 3 . 2 In section 3 . 2 , the Desys project D 1 experiment , will be described . Following this , the relevance of the context research study is analyzed in Section 3 . 3 . Sec - tion 3 . 4 reports on how the contexts are indicated and the way they are being treated . Section 3 . 5 reports the role of context in communication during the in - formational transaction . After learned these phenomena , the design process and context knowledge has been formalize in section 3 . 6 . The conclusions are drawn in section 3 . 7 . 3 . 2 Introduction to the Desys Project As part of the Desys project , the D 1 experiment aimed at studying information handling provided by means of design support and then identifying any oppor - tunities to do so . This experiment , as depicted in ﬁgure 3 . 1 [ Knoop , 1997 ] , was based on a conceptual design task given to a designer . The designer S performing the design process P was located in an observation room with audio and video equipment facilities , where he was assisted by an experimenter E 1 who was seated at the same table . E 1 played the role of an expert in providing pertinent informa - tion . Meanwhile , E 2 , observed both S and E 1 , in a separate room and controlling the audio and video equipment . Both experimenters , E 1 and E 2 , observed the requests , answers and results , and also noted the activities of S . However , since E 1 had to answer questions from S , his observational activities were considered as incomplete . And therefore in this case , E 2 had a more complete observation . Figure 3 . 1 : Structure of D 1 Experiment The task that was chosen for the experiment reﬂected an industrial problem , 3 . 3 THE RELEVANCE OF THE CONTEXT STUDY AND D 1 EXPERIMENT 51 addressing a mixture of generating a concept together with the technical speciﬁ - cations in both the mechanical and electrical domain . For this experiment , the subject ( S ) had to design a bicycle lighting system that would power the light bulb even when the bicycle speed was low or the bicycle was standing still for a short period of time . Subject had to generate a brief description of the concept how it fulﬁlled the requirements . E 1 and E 2 made real time notes on an observa - tion list as shown in ﬁgure 3 . 1 . This list contains the start and end of the task , observed activities , requests , answers , and results that were represented by their time , description and indication . At the end of each session , E 1 and E 2 made a ﬁrst version of their transcript by combining their notes and , if necessary , observ - ing the video and audio recordings . This transcript ﬁle , called f - ﬁle ( see : 1 ) , was structured as follows : • File identiﬁcation • Header • Start time of the task • Transcription of the events • End time of the task In this research , two sample f - ﬁle s from session 1 and 2 of the D 1 experiment have been studied ( see : appendix ) . f - ﬁle 1 Session 1 13 : 08 : 25 a [ ] 0 activity ( start _ of _ assignment ; ; ) # the activities are renamed to studying the assignment 13 : 09 : 40 a [ 1 ] 1 activity ( " studying the assignment " ; marking the assignment on page 1 ) 13 : 12 : 35 a [ 1 ] 1 activity ( " studying the assignment " ; marking the assignment on page 2 ) # the activity is renamed to making notes on the assignment 13 : 13 : 00 a [ 1 ] 1 activity ( " making notes on the assignment " ; making notes about the requirements ; 42 ) # sample 1 # the request following this activity indicates an information # collection , the activity is therefore placed before the ri [ ] 1 and # its time is changed to that of ri [ ] 1 , the description is shortened 13 : 13 : 30 a [ 1 ] 3 activity ( " collecting technical information " ; collecting information on the technical environmen 13 : 13 : 30 ri [ ] 1 request ( what are the different types of rear - wheels on which the generator has to fit , how are integrated in their environment , how does the internal of the hub look like such as chain gear - case , overcoat guard , pedal brake , calliper brake and drum brake ) # end sample 1 # this activity which occurs more than once is named sketching rear # axle area 13 : 15 : 00 a [ 1 ] 4 activity ( " sketching rear axle area " ; sketching ; 42 centre ) # this answer comes when s is in an activity that is another than the # one in which the request was raised 13 : 15 : 30 ii [ 1 ] 1 answer information sheet ’hub’ ; 1 ) 3 . 3 The Relevance of the Context Study and D 1 Experiment To draw the relevance between this research and the Desys experiment , a situation design studio is illustrated . Suppose there is a designer doing his design task , 52 THE STUDY OF CONTEXT KNOWLEDGE IN DESIGN PRACTICE 1 3 . 3 along with an expert who can give any answer needed , sitting side by side . In the middle of the design process , the designer asks the expert a question : ”What is the radius ? ” It would be no surprise if the expert could understand the question and answer it correctly . First of all , it is common in human communication that people able to understand a question without having it complete . The second reason is that the expert has been following the designer’s work since the beginning of the project . Therefore , the expert knew to what radius the designer was referring . If the designer had asked other experts that had the same level of expertise but had not followed the design process , it is likely that the expert would have asked for additional information on the question ; for instance , ”To what radius are you referring ? Is it the radius of the wheels or the chain - wheels ? ” As already mentioned in chapter 1 , for a human to human designer - information provider relationship , this kind of example where both parties gradually develop a context does exist . But it is still a challenge to make , computers doing the same thing . It is not the intention of this study to get involved in a controversial issue of human versus computer or of who could or should handle knowledge utilization during a design process . However , computers are already involved in aiding de - signers in other aspects of design . Therefore , it is possible for a computer to play a role in supporting the designer in utilizing knowledge during a design process . However , there are still many obstacles and diﬃculties in developing a suitable knowledge utilization support system using a computer . Some reasons for this include the lack of computer capabilities over human capabilities . Humans can easily integrate diﬀerent kinds and pieces of knowledge from diﬀerent domains . In contrast , computers need a clear information classiﬁcation and certain rules in order to integrate it . For example , a designer can unconsciously use pure ge - ometric knowledge and consider aesthetics and other knowledge while making a design model . Humans can also easily process incomplete informational input to produce an expected result , but it is diﬃcult for a computer to produce the correct results without having complete and exact input . Referring back to the design sub - process , it is common for the designer to jump from one sub - process to another or deal with more than one process at a time . A designer can gain a better understanding of a problem while he or she is trying to solve a design issue . Designers may have to choose two or more alternatives to solve a design problem . Quite the opposite , it is certainly very diﬃcult to deploy all of these capabilities with only a computer . From the above illustration , it can be understood that a context has been transferred or shared among the designer and the knowledge provider . The knowl - edge provider uses context in order to retrieve the necessary information for the user . The user will then interpret or transform the information into his or her own knowledge . The Data of f - ﬁle and video in the D 1 experiment recorded the question - answer session in an earlier phase of the design process between a de - signer and an information provider . Furthermore , the experiment also recorded how the designer jumped from one problem or topic to another . It almost per - fectly represented how an actual system support can handle such situations during 3 . 4 INDICATING THE EXISTENCE OF CONTEXT IN THE DESIGN PROCESS 53 the design process . It is now a challenge to understand and formulate it . A sys - tem that aims at helping the designer in the same situation will be signiﬁcantly beneﬁcial from this formulation . 3 . 4 Indicating the Existence of Context in the Design Process Only if there is enough initial knowledge one can manipulate data [ Ullman , 2001 ] . This condition also applies to the situation where one must gather additional knowledge or retrieve information . The initial knowledge should be suﬃcient to have queries to the knowledge or information from the provider in order to re - ceive relevant information . During the iteration process of searching for / receiving information , the context should become more and more clear , as illustrated in ﬁg - ure 3 . 2 . Initial Knowledge context t = t 0 Accumulated Knowledge context t = t i t = t ( i + x ) Accumulated Knowledge context Figure 3 . 2 : Knowledge growth and information exchange 54 THE STUDY OF CONTEXT KNOWLEDGE IN DESIGN PRACTICE 1 3 . 4 3 . 4 . 1 Indicating the Existence of Context by the Emergence of New Issues The emergence of new issues can indicate the growth of context , assuming that the designer’s knowledge is growing when he / she receives the incoming knowledge or information from the information provider . As shown in ﬁgure 3 . 2 , if the context is the subset of the accumulated knowledge , the capability to identify the necessary knowledge also increases . From this study , it can be expected to ﬁnd new design issues during the design process . Method The data from the transcript ﬁle ( f - ﬁle ) was read sequentially and divided into blocks . Each block was deﬁned as lines from the f - ﬁle transcript within a ”sample” and lines from before the project started . Within this block , every issue found was extracted . An issue could be noticed by keywords or terms of information requested by the designer , dialogues between the designer and expert , and doc - uments studied by the designer . At the end of each block , the most dominating issue tackled by the designer was what is referred to as as a designer’s ”focus” in that particular stage . However , when a designer tackles all issues equally , then the focus will not be seen . When a new issue appeared , it was tagged as ”new” . In addition , when new issues were inherited from the previous connected termi - nology , a tag ”sub” was included at its next appearance . Furthermore , when two issues had a connection to each other , a ”connect” tag was given . In order to indicate the context , an example of the f - ﬁle analysis method can be seen below . f - ﬁle Analysis and Discussion After studying the design requirements , the designer requested some information ( tagged as six initial issues at time 13 : 13 : 30 ) , see : f - ﬁle session 1 . This can be regarded as a starting point of the context - knowledge growth . Every new issue arising from the starting point until the end of the design assignment was noticed within ﬁve minute time intervals , as shown in ﬁgure 3 . 3 . New issues were frequently noticed during the ﬁrst 15 minute period , where the highest number ( 14 ) occurred in the period between minutes 10 and 20 . There were no new issues between minutes 35 and 45 , minutes 65 and 100 , or after minute 125 until the end of the design assignment . Figure 3 . 4 shows the accumulation of new issues from the beginning until the end of the design process . 3 . 4 INDICATING THE EXISTENCE OF CONTEXT IN THE DESIGN PROCESS 55 Figure 3 . 3 : New design issues Figure 3 . 4 : Total new design issues This study conﬁrms that the designer has the initial contextual knowledge needed as he / she can make some informational requests . This analysis shows that an issue might inﬂuence new knowledge / information discoveries . In the periods where there were no new issues , it was observed that the designer was busy with elaboration or was dealing with previous issues . Indeed , it can be concluded that at the end of the design assignment when the idea / concept was practically concrete , no new issues arose . 56 THE STUDY OF CONTEXT KNOWLEDGE IN DESIGN PRACTICE 1 3 . 4 f - ﬁles Analysis 13 : 08 : 25 start of assignment # the activities are renamed to studying the assignment13 : 09 : 40 a [ 1 ] 1 activity ( ”studying the as - signment” ; marking the assignment on page 1 ) 13 : 12 : 35 a [ 1 ] 1 activity ( ”studying the as - signment” ; marking the assignment on page 2 ) # the activity is renamed to making notes on the assignment 13 : 13 : 00 a [ 1 ] 1 activity ( ”making notes on the assignment” ; making notes about the requirements ; 42 ) # sample 1 # the request following this activity indi - cates an information # collection , the activity is therefore placed before the ri [ 1 ] and # its time is changed to that of ri [ 1 ] , the description is shortened 13 : 13 : 30 a [ 3 ] 1 activity ( ”collecting technical information” ; collecting information on the technical environment ) 13 : 13 : 30 ri [ 1 ] request ( what are the diﬀerent types of rear - wheels on which the generator has to ﬁt , how are they integrated in their environment , how does the internal of the hub look like such as chain gear - case , over - coat guard , pedal brake , calliper brake and drum brake ) # end sample 1 1 st blockIssues : a .

Our assumption , since the expert was the only knowledge / information provider that could develop the context while others ( books , physical models , pictures , sheets , etc . ) could not , was that the expert must more quickly provide knowledge / information to the designer . Method This method using the diﬀerence between the time the designer received an answer and the time when he or she asked ( or looked ) for information . From each type of answering delay time and answering delivery the indication of the existing of context can be found . Results and Discussion Figure 3 . 5 shows the results of the study . Books imply the longest delay time while oral replies needed the shortest amount of time . To allow the results to be more clearly understood , the frequency distribution of the above results is shown 3 . 5 INDICATING THE EXISTENCE OF CONTEXT IN THE DESIGN PROCESS 59 in ﬁgure 3 . 6 . Most oral communications gave answers in less than one minute ; nineteen examples were directly supplied by the knowledge / information provider . Figure 3 . 5 : Answering time per channel of communication Figure 3 . 6 : Frequency of distribution of answering - time This study conﬁrms the important role of context while gathering knowledge or retrieving information between the designer and the information provider . 60 THE STUDY OF CONTEXT KNOWLEDGE IN DESIGN PRACTICE 1 3 . 5 3 . 5 The Role of Context in Communication In addition to the results of the study as described in subsection 3 . 4 . 2 , a study of the role of context between the communication of the designer and knowl - edge / information provider was conducted . The hypothesis that will be tested is that ”every question asked an information provider can be and needs to be accompanied by context ( s ) . A richer context gives the information provider a better chance of providing a correct and relevant answer at the right time . ” The questions made by the designer ( subject ) in session 1 and 2 of the D 1 experiment have been analyzed . This analysis aimed at ﬁguring out the relation - ship between the questions asked by the subject and the context surrounding the question - answer process . Therefore , this analysis focused on the following points : 1 . Concreteness of the question 2 . Relevance of the question At the beginning of this analysis , the expectations formulated were as follows : 1 . There will be some cases found where the questions are not concrete or implicit , or may be incomplete questions that the information provider can still understand . 2 . There will be some cases where the question is related to previous questions . 3 . There will be some cases where contextual transfers / dialogues occur within the question - answer process . Terminologies , Deﬁnitions , and Analysis Some terminologies were introduced for the analysis ; they are described as follows : 1 . The subject is a designer who is asking questions to the expert ( information provider ) 2 . The observer is the one who observes the transcript ﬁle ( f - ﬁle ) 3 . Time is the time stamped in the protocol when a question is asked 4 . Concreteness of questions determines whether the question is explicit ; it is explicit if the observer can understand it without referring to previous questions and answers . ”Y” means the question is explicit and ”N” means the question is implicit . 5 . The channel of communication refers to the question or context transacted between the subject and the information provider . ”S” means the question and / or context was literally transacted . ”T” means the question or context 3 . 5 THE ROLE OF CONTEXT IN COMMUNICATION 61 was transacted via a written text . The question may have been transacted literally but the context was transacted via a text . In the D1 protocol , session 2 , time 14 : 29 : 00 , for example , the subject asked the question ”Does this formula give the eﬀective voltage ? ” In this case , it is assumed that the subject was showing a written formula to the information provider . ”P” means the question or context was transacted via a picture / drawing sheet . ”O” means the question or context was transacted via a physical object . 6 . Was the question related to a previous question ? ”Y” indicates the observer assumed that the question had a relationship with the question - answer pro - cess or request activities . 7 . Did the question relate to an earlier question ? ”Y” was marked if the question was related to an earlier question or request activity . 8 . Was conﬁrmation needed ? ”Y” was marked if the information provider asked the subject to conﬁrm his / her understanding of the question or to redirect his / her context . 9 . Were context word ( s ) needed ? ”Y” was marked if the question contained one or more words that could point to previous question - answer processes or request activities . The procedure of this analysis is as follows : 1 . The observer should read the f - ﬁle sequentially 2 . The observer has to ﬁnd the question to the activity ”request” of the f - ﬁle 3 . The observer must notice the time stamp when the request happens 4 . Requests not in a question form should be excluded from the table but should be recorded because they may be involved in building the context 5 . The observer should check the question to determine whether he / she can understand the question without further speciﬁcation . 6 . The observer should observe how the question is transacted , whether lit - erally or in need of an explanation or additional information using texts , pictures or physical objects . 7 . The observer should determine whether the question has a relationship to previous request and answer activities from the f - ﬁle 8 . The observer should determine whether the question has a relationship with earlier questions and not all request and answer activities 9 . The observer should determine whether the answer activity related to the request activity and whether it was in a question form or not 62 THE STUDY OF CONTEXT KNOWLEDGE IN DESIGN PRACTICE 1 3 . 5 10 . The observer should determine whether the question contained one or more words that related to other request or answer activities of the f - ﬁle Results and Discussion From the results below , most of the questions can be considered explicit . In session one , none of the eleven questions were implicit . Only two out of twenty - two were implicit in session two . All implicit questions were related to the previous questions . On the contrary , not all of the explicit questions had a relationship with the previous questions . These results show us that an implicit question occurs if the question has a strong relationship with previous questions . For instance , in session two , at 14 : 35 : 05 , the question ”Are they equally expensive ? ” is not explicit to the observer . However , after the observer sees the previous request at 14 : 33 : 40 concerning the current existing batteries , it is clear to the observer that the question should be as follows : ”Are these existing batteries equally expensive ? ” Here , it can be seen that the information provider already had a context ; therefore , it is not a problem to understand the implicit or incomplete question . Both sessions one and two show that most of the questions have a relationship with the previous question or request activities . Indeed , most of the questions have a relationship with earlier questions or request activities . These results show that the context has been developed during the question - answer process and even during the design process as a whole . Few questions have no relationship between the entire request - answer process or the earlier question or request . These results give the indication that a new context has been built . On the other hand , questions at 14 : 51 : 30 , 14 : 51 : 30 and 15 : 00 : 00 of session two , have a relationship with the previous request - answer process but have nothing to do with the earlier question . This could be an indication of a subject shift back to the speciﬁc focus of the design problem that he or she previously left . The results also show that most questions contain word ( s ) that can point to the previous request - answer process or request activities . All of the questions that contain a context word ( s ) have a relationship with the previous request - answer process or request activity . In most cases , the context transfer uses speech as a channel of communication . The questions are explained literally during the dialogue between the subject and the information provider . However , it happens twice that the contexts are transferred via ( or refer to ) a physical object . At one time they are transferred using a text . Other evidence found in these results indicated that in most cases , the initiative of context building comes from the subject who asks the question , but the context could also be requested by the information provider in order to deliver an answer . In this case , the information provider will reply to a question from the subject with another question . In other words , conﬁrmation is needed by the information provider in order to have the correct context . The results of this analysis are consistent with some of the expectations .

This study also found that most of the questions have a rela - tionship to previous question - answer processes or request activities that give an indication that a speciﬁc / local context has been developed . Here also can be found some possible channels of communication that transferred the context . However , it is not possible to use this analysis to measure the quality of the answers due to the absence of feedback from the subject regarding incoming data / information from the information provider . Another reason is that these question - answer pro - cesses occurred as a part of the design process where the results of the design process itself are also progressing . 3 . 6 Proposed Formalism Guided by the results of this study , a formalism of the design process and context knowledge have been proposed . This formalism is used as the foundation of the development of a knowledge - gathering and information - retrieving support tool to be used during product design . 3 . 6 . 1 Design Process Formalism The design process will be denoted as D . This process begins at t start and ends at t end . In this process , the designer ( s ) , denoted as S , is creating models M ( t ) that can be changed from time to time until the end of the design process at t end . The knowledge providers R , such as databases , books , experts , etc . , provide a set of items of information J = { d j 1 , d j 2 , d j 3 . . . d jm } at T J = { t j 1 , t j 2 , t j 3 . . . t jm } , where d i is an information item provided by R at time t ji . If all received information items d j 1 , d j 2 , d j 3 . . . d jm ∈ J and I include the set of all information , then : J ⊂ I . In order to received the necessary information , S must produce and pass Q = { q 1 , q 2 , q 3 . . . q m } at T Q = { t q 1 , t q 2 , t q 3 . . . t qm } to R , where q i is a query item passed by S to R at time t qi . Therefore , the design process D can be described as follows : D = ( S , R , M ( t ) , t start , t end , J , Q , T J , T Q ) It can be assumed that before t = t start , the designer S has accumulated pieces of knowledge k i 1 , k i 2 , k i 3 . . . k im in a set of initial knowledge K i . Tacit knowledge , such as designer experience and / or any knowledge that he or she previously had t = t start are included in this initial knowledge . All of these pieces of knowledge are denoted as k i 1 , k i 2 , k i 3 . . . k im and are members of K i . It can also be assumed that all of the received information items of J can be interpreted or transformed into knowledge by the designer in process P . There - fore , the process P , can be seen as mapping I from K ; thus : P : I → K , i . e . , if P ( d jm ) = K m . If all incoming information in J can be transformed into knowledge and it can be assumed that nothing was lost during the process and that it can all be 3 . 7 CONCLUDING REMARKS 65 stored , then this knowledge is accumulated in the designer’s set of accumulated knowledge K a ( t ) as pieces of knowledge that are denoted as k a 1 , k a 2 , k a 3 . . . k am . The accumulated knowledge ( K a ) at time t can then be expressed as follows : K a ( t ) = K i ∪ m = 1 , n P (cid:0) d jm (cid:1) , t jm ≤ t The accumulated knowledge K a ( t ) is a union of the initial knowledge and the knowledge from the interpretation or transformation process of all received infor - mation items . At the beginning of the design process , K a ( t start ) = K i because there is yet no interpretation or transformation from information to knowledge . At the end of the process , where t = t end , the knowledge accumulated at the completion of D can be seen as : P ( J ) = K a ( t end ) As a note , if K is a set of all knowledge , then K i ⊂ K as well as K a ( t ) ⊂ K . 3 . 6 . 2 Context Knowledge Formalism Context knowledge is a subset of all knowledge accumulated by the user and has been or will be transferred or shared to the knowledge provider ( which is not necessarily a human knowledge provider ) . Therefore , at time t , the context knowledge K c ( t ) can be expressed as K c ( t ) ⊂ K a ( t ) . However , in order to share the context knowledge , the user S must express it as understandable information to the knowledge provider R . Let E repre - sent a process to express the knowledge into a set of context information C . If d c 1 , d c 2 , d c 3 . . . d cm are pieces of information deducted from K c in a process of E ( K c ) , then d c 1 , d c 2 , d c 3 . . . d c m ∈ C . Therefore , it is also true that d c 1 , d c 2 , d c 3 . . . d c m ∈ I . It is true that the designer can express his / her initial knowledge K i into a set of information V that contains informational pieces d v 1 , d v 2 , d v 3 . . . d vm in a E ( K i ) process . Therefore , for a query q m that is passed by the designer S at time t jm < t qm ≤ t , a set of additional context information C m can be delivered along with this query , where C m ⊂ { V ∪ J } and d ci ∈ C m : d ci related to q m . 3 . 7 Concluding Remarks The results of this study have provided indications and evidence of the existence of context during the design process . The evidence shows the important roles of two types of context . The ﬁrst type of context , which is increasing along with the growth of accumulated knowledge , is very important in the knowledge and infor - mation transaction . The second type of context is very helpful for communication between the designer and the knowledge / information provider . Although both of them are important , for the purpose od this research work , this study focuses on 66 THE STUDY OF CONTEXT KNOWLEDGE IN DESIGN PRACTICE 1 3 . 7 the ﬁrst type of context . For this reason , a formalism of the design process and context knowledge has been provided . The study of the Desys project is very important because it can reﬂect the con - ditions of ﬁnding information during the design process through an ”intelligent” agent acting as an expert , in which the intelligent agent knows the context hidden in questions . It is extremely diﬃcult to understand and make a generalization of how the designer and expert in this study can develop and share a common under - standing in their communication . Nevertheless , this kind of context shows that the informational resource ( the expert ) can give a correct answer in a relatively short period of time for an incomplete question asked by the designer . The study also describes that each designer has his / her own information searching path that depends on their tacit knowledge . This study suggest that although the subjects had the same level of education , for each design problem and knowledge source , every designer has his / her own way of ﬁnding a design solution . They have their own questions to be answered . If the knowledge source is passive and only reacts to the designer’s questions , then it can be said that every answer is based on the designer’s question formulation . In other words , ev - ery question is an actual reﬂection or representation of a designer’s knowledge . It can also be seen that each answer from the knowledge source will trigger another question and / or another idea . It could then be said that every answer received will encourage designers to have a better formulation of information need . Formalism of the design process and context knowledge have been made . These formalisms will be used as a guide to conceptualize a system in chapter 4 and pilot the implementation of a proof - of - concept system in chapter 5 . Chapter 4 System Conceptualization ”The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity . ” - Doug Horton 4 . 1 Introduction The question - answer activities between the designer and the expert in chapter 3 is in a sense analogous to the web information search through a search engine . The internet user will supply a search term that could be a keyword , a phrase or a combination of keywords / phrases . In response , the search engine will give a list of related web pages , if any . These search results are based on the supplied search terms accordingly , with the most relevant page appearing ﬁrst due to the search algorithm . However , unlike the process between the designer and the expert , the process between the user and the search engine has a very short life - cycle . As depicted in ﬁgure 4 . 1 , the process between the user and the search engine ends when the search engine gives its response , namely a list of web pages . User Search Engine Search terms Web pages Figure 4 . 1 : Web information search life - cycle 67 68 SYSTEM CONCEPTUALIZATION 4 . 1 By means of the question - answer analogy , it is assumed that designers use the search engines repetitively . For a design problem , they might look for information on the internet throughout a search engine using more than one supplied search term . There are two main logical reasons why designers complete an iterative information search process . First of all , since the design concept during the early phases of design is vague and incomplete , the query might evolve by query refor - mulation . Or , the designer could initiate a number of searches just to generate ideas . The second reason is the nature of the design process where a designer could jump from one sub - design problem to another . A sub - design problem often needs more than one informational source or type , e . g . , the geometry , material properties , aesthetics , and manufacturing . In order to support designers in building , retrieving and sharing such contexts , a system has been built . This chapter will describe the concept of the web - based Contextual Design Information Retrieval System . This system conceptualization is based on the literature survey of chapter 2 and the ﬁndings in the study of chapter 3 . If every question that is supplied to the knowledge source is a reﬂection of a designer’s knowledge , then it is important that such a web information search system not only record the search results , but more importantly , the search terms . Because the combination of the ’right’ search terms and the ’relevant’ search results and their relationship is a kind of knowledge , storing this information will take one step further in answering the question of how to share the ( design ) knowledge . Prior to this fact , it would useful if the track of the search terms could be seen ( at least during the search activity ) historically , so that the designer’s cognitive thought processes could be mapped . So far , some search engines have provided the possibility of keeping the search terms and the search results once , as previously mentioned in 1 . 3 . Despite the fact that this state - of - the - art web information retrieval system is very useful and helpful in general , it needs further eﬀorts to comply with informational processing in design projects . First of all , it should not only be personalized ( every user has their own search and search results ) but must also segregate this search activity into a compartmentalized design project . Second , it should give designers the space needed to decide which search results are relevant . The above - mentioned search engines will keep the clicked search results in a history database , even though they are not always relevant . Third , as mentioned in chapter 3 , when designers focus on a design problem , they might use more than one search term in order to ﬁnd relevant information for problem solutions or ideas . Consequently , the system that aims at helping the designer should also manage the relationship among the associative search terms when deﬁned as a context . In practice , designers print out the relevant search results and put them into a design project folder , where other documents , such as drawing sketches , brain - storming reports , meeting reports , etc . , are also included . It would be good if these associative documents , along with the search terms and the relevant search results , could be stored contextually in a better way . Hypothetically , this would make it easier for the designer to access this information . 4 . 2 INTRODUCTION 69 ( a ) Context Projects Contexts has [ 1 : m ] Keywords has [ 1 : m ] URLs Documents has [ 1 : m ] has [ 1 : m ] ( b ) Context granularity Figure 4 . 2 : Basic concept of the information search ’context’ The basic concept of a hierarchical context based on theory and ﬁndings de - scribed in chapter 3 and the deﬁnitions in 2 . 5 is shown in ﬁgure 4 . 2 . The rela - tionship between a search term ( keyword ) with a list of relevant search results and user’s attached documents is shown at a very low level of context . A group of interrelated search terms that represent the designer’s focus on a particular design problem is referred to as ”context” . A project contains a list of contexts and individual search terms . The original of this idea of ”context” not only to encourage designers to ﬁnd relevant information , but also allows them to make this kind of knowledge trans - ferable . Since designers often work in groups , it is good if they can share informa - tion contextually . An additional reason is that design companies often suﬀer from a loss of knowledge when a designer leaves the company and takes their gained knowledge with them . This chapter is aimed at brieﬂy overviewing the implemented prototype sys - tem concept . Section 4 . 2 gives the overview of the system , while section 4 . 3 and section 4 . 4 describe the search information personalization . The core of the sys - tem , namely project , search , and context management modules , are described in separate sections . There are many ways and methods to describe the concepts and architectural styles of this system which are dependant on original purposes . Nonetheless , it should be clear , simple , and easy to implement these into a system artifact . The most important parts of an architectural concept of a software sys - tem are entities , data ﬂow , processes , data storage and the relationship between data entities . To show these parts of the system , the implemented prototype in this research is described by data - ﬂow diagrams and an entity relationship diagram . The Gane - Sarson’s data ﬂow diagram notations have been chosen to standardize the notations of the chosen description method . 70 SYSTEM CONCEPTUALIZATION 4 . 2 4 . 2 System Overview The system is designed to interface between the user and the search engine , so that the state of question - answer sessions in chapter 3 can be situated as shown in ﬁgure 4 . 3 . The user gives his search terms to the search engine directly , and the search terms will be passed through the system . In return , the search engine will give the search results for every search term received from the system to the user via the system , but the user will have a chance to manage them contextually . CDIRS User Search Engine User’s Data Contextual Information User’s Search Term Search Results UserID User Profile Project Profile Search Term Figure 4 . 3 : System overview In order to manage this search activity and its results , the user of the system must create his / her own user and design project proﬁles . The user must invest some time in the beginning to create these proﬁles . The user will then only supply his user identiﬁcation ( userID ) to log on to the system and load the stored projects or begin a new ( web information search for a design ) project . The system also allows the user to embed his relevant data , such as digital drawings or sketches , oﬃce ﬁles or media ﬁles , to a search term . 4 . 3 SYSTEM OVERVIEW 71 As shown in ﬁgure 4 . 4 , each user will have their own account and will complete the design information search on the internet through a search engine for a speciﬁc design project . Every new user will be added to the users’ database and will be veriﬁed with their supplied userID and password each time they log on to the system . This unique userID will be used to identify the owner of the projects that are stored in the project proﬁle database . Therefore , every single internet search activity is dedicated to a speciﬁc project and a particular designer . In this way , it is then possible for the user to include his / her own data for a speciﬁc information context ( from the internet search activities ) of his speciﬁc design project . Instead of using the conventional way of ﬁnding information from the internet where users only have bookmarks of search results with no context , the return user of this system can retrieve a project where the search terms and the relevant results are bookmarked and the user’s own ﬁles are attached within a context .

The user validation screen is the gate to the system ; hence , the user must supply his / her userID and password . The system will make a query to ﬁnd a matching combination of a userID and password in the user proﬁle database . Once the system ﬁnds the match combination , it will allow the veriﬁed user to go to the project menu and and update the user log in the session database . If the userID and password entered is incorrect , the system will provide a userID and password exclamation . A registered user can try with another combination . Meanwhile , a non - registered user can sign up as a new user by creating a new userID , password , and detail proﬁles . A log will be updated every session subsequent to a successful login . Figure 4 . 5 shows the user validation and addition process . UserID User User Profile Project Owner Saved User Users Verified UserID Register New User Login Session Logged User Figure 4 . 5 : User validation and addition 4 . 4 Project After ﬁnding the match of the supplied userID and password through the valida - tion query , the system will retrieve a list of the user’s available projects , if any . The system will notify the user of the last project that was completed before the last successful logout . By selecting one of the available projects , the user can then begin an internet search as depicted in ﬁgure 5 . 4 . In this way , the user can 4 . 5 SEARCH 73 continue any terminated information search activities without forgetting valuable search terms and results . Like a design activity as a whole , part of the informa - tion search activity is to have a search term as a representation of the designer’s brain work that is too valuable to be lost . Some conventional search engines do not keep the search term because they are designed to have a very short life - cycle , as described in section 4 . 1 . Others do keep these search terms , however , they are not managed into separate project folders and are less meaningful to the user and less likely to be put into a context . To start a new project , users can create their own new project or participate in another user’s shared project . When a user starts a new project , he or she should supply project proﬁle data , such as a project name and a project identiﬁcation ( projectID ) . With the exception of the projectID , if necessary , the stored project proﬁle can be edited . It is important to supply the design requirements along with other project proﬁle data . Design requirements often become information search objects during the early stages of a design , allowing the design results to meet their requirements . According to the developed theory in chapter 3 the designer has actual initial knowledge . This system allows a designer to input possible and potential search terms while supplying a project proﬁle data . These search terms will appear when the designer completes information search activities . In practice , a design project is often done by a group of designers . They could be divided into smaller groups and then come together with the best design or idea , or divide the project into smaller and more speciﬁc works . Whatever project working style has been chosen , in general , there will be a brain - storming phase and progress meeting for the project . Therefore , the system should also allow the user to join a project ( created by another user ) . Every user of a joint project will have his / her own information search , but at the same time , it will be possible to keep the search activities within a project and share the search results among users of a particular design team . Only the owner of a project has authority to make any changes in the project proﬁle . After saving the new project proﬁle or selecting one of the available projects , a user can begin a search . More details about this will be described in section 4 . 5 . After obtaining the necessary information , the user can then manage these indi - vidual search terms into contexts . Further details on this context management will be explained in section 4 . 6 . 4 . 5 Search A “Do - search” play role is a core function of this system , where the user can search information with a dedicated conventional search engine in a web - browser . However , this system also oﬀers an added value that complies with the design process . The term ’dedicated’ means that the system should not do any “meta - searching” or use more than one search engine in a query , because this can violate the terms of service for some search engines . However , the system should work for 74 SYSTEM CONCEPTUALIZATION 4 . 5 Project Profile User User’s Data Search Term Project Owner User validation and addition User’s Search Term Search Engine Contextual Information Search Results Project Profile Existing Project ( s ) New Project ( s ) Do Search Create New Own Project Manage Context ( s ) Saved Search Term Edit Project Profile Selected Project Edited Project Keywords Initial Search Term Stored Search Term Context ID Requirements New Requirements Figure 4 . 6 : Project most search engines and should be able to embed any search engine in general . Any search engine company can beneﬁt by adopting this system . The search engine should not be manipulated , thus avoiding any jurisdiction risks that could be interpreted as cracking such search engines . They should remain as they are , with all of their original search results and other features and advertisements . As can be seen in ﬁgure 4 . 7 , when a user selects one of the available projects , 4 . 5 SEARCH 75 the system will recall the search function . The system will initialize a search engine by sending the user’s search term . In the case of a new project , when the user saves the project proﬁle , any initial search terms that represent the user’s initial knowledge will be stored in a keywords database and loaded in the search function . Once the user selects these stored search terms , they will be sent to the search engine . In response , the search engine will send a list of search results to the “show results” process . From the list of these search results , users will then select any relevant results and bookmark them . More details about the bookmarking process will be described in section 4 . 5 . On the contrary , the user might not ﬁnd any relevant information from the search process . In this case , there will be no bookmarking process , unless the user decides to do so , as opposed to some existing search engine history features that record every clicked search result . The user will not only have a list of bookmarked URLs , but may also want to embed his or her supportive ﬁles for each relevant search term . These ﬁles will then be stored in a ”documents” database and always associated with a particular search term . If a user has more than one individual search term , he / she might want to build a context by associating the search terms in a context management . This context management function is the same as was mentioned in section 4 . 4 . Bookmark A search engine will rank the search results based on their algorithm from the most relevant to the least . The existing search engines are judged by the their users based on their ”guess” . The closer the guess is to what the users expect , the better the acknowledgment they will get , although there are some ”nasty” search engines that give any party who pays more the highest ranking . Furthermore , some popular search engines , who have great conﬁdence in their algorithm , will provide a sorted list of search results . For instance , only the ﬁrst ten search results , or possibly only the ﬁrst , will be displayed . The limitation of search results oﬀered by search engines sounds good to the user because it helps the user avoid the ”noise” of said search . However , there are at least two arguments to counter why this is not always the best scenario in a design situation . First , since the search terms are actually the manifestation of the user’s knowledge of what should be searched , it is possible that at the very early stages of design where the concept is vague , the search terms might not be correct . It could be because there is a limitation of knowledge about what is to be searched , or perhaps because of the formulation of the search term . The wrong formulation might put the ”relevant” search results lower on the sorted list and hinder the user from ﬁnding it . Second , when designers work out the design problem , they might use two diﬀerent approaches at once : divergence and convergence . This limitation may help in the convergence approach , as opposed to divergence . In conclusion , this system will allow the user to judge which search results 76 SYSTEM CONCEPTUALIZATION 4 . 5 Selected Project Project Profile User’s Data User Search Term User’s Search Term Search Engine Saved Search Term Manage Context ( s ) Search Results Stored Search Term Keywords Do Bookmark New Search Term Bookmarks New Bookmark Show Results List of URLs Initialize Search Engine Selected URLs Embed User’s Data Documents Linked Document Figure 4 . 7 : Completing a Search are relevant and also allow them to rely on the original search engine’s rank . As depicted in ﬁgure 4 . 8 , the search results are shown in the “show results” process and will be selected by the user . When the user decides to bookmark a selected search result , the system will verify the existence of the search term . If the system 4 . 6 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT 77 ﬁnds one , it will go through the bookmarking veriﬁcation process . If not , it will trigger a pre - store process to ensure that the correct search results are given and that the associated search terms are stored correctly . For the existing search term , the system will directly store the selected search result if it cannot ﬁnd one during the veriﬁcation process , and only on the condition that the user wants to store it . New Bookmark Bookmarks Selected URLs Show Results New Search Term Keywords Verify Existing Search Term Check Existing Bookmark Existing Search Term Existing Bookmarks Associated Search Term Figure 4 . 8 : Bookmark 4 . 6 Context Management Lists of individual search terms are stored during the iterative search process . These search terms represent the necessary information needed for design problem - solving . When the information is needed , the user can execute the search term through the search engine . Meanwhile , the bookmarked URLs represent the selected relevant information of such search results . However , these individual search terms and their contents ( search results , bookmarked relevant URLs , and embedded ﬁles ) do not represent the user’s focus , as mentioned in chapter 3 . The context management function allows the user to build such contexts from stored individual search terms , as shown in ﬁgure 4 . 9 . The user can build a context with at least two associated search terms . To build a context , a user needs to supply a contextID and then add all appropriate search terms from the search activity . This process reﬂects the proposed theory in chapter 3 that the knowledge about context is cultivated along with the growth of incoming information that is relevant . It is quite possible that the user will complete the 78 SYSTEM CONCEPTUALIZATION 4 . 6 search process ﬁrst and then group all individual search terms according to their contexts . Contextual Information User Saved Search Term Do Search Building Context Contextual Linked Search Term Visualize Context Selected Contextual Context ID Contexts Saved Context ID Selected Context Edit Context Chosen Context Edited Context Context Visualization Chosen Contextual Edited Contextual Figure 4 . 9 : Context management Since a search term could appear in two or more diﬀerent contexts , the linked search terms of a distinctive context and the information about the context itself are stored in diﬀerent data storages . The information about the context , such as context name and explanation , are stored in a ”context” database , while the associated search terms are stored in a ”contextual” database . For example , in the bicycle design case , the term ”material” could appear in a ”bicycle frame” context . It could also possibly appear in another part of the bicycle , such as ”chain” . If necessary , the user may want to edit or delete a context . Through the editing 4 . 7 INFORMATION DESIGN 79 context process , users can edit the context information or remove an associated search term . Given that a context should contain more then one search term , users must delete a context if there are only two search terms and one of them is out of context , or they must alternatively add a new one and then remove the unneeded search term . To provide an adequate representation of a context , the system will visualize a context in a 2 - D representation , rather than a simple list or tree view . A selected context will appear and interconnect with its associated search terms . Each search term will then interconnect with its URLs and ﬁles in a 2 - D representation . These interconnections are represented by lines from a context to the search term and from a search term to the URLs and ﬁles . 4 . 7 Information Design From the above data ﬂow diagrams , a concept of the database for the system implementation has been derived , as shown in ﬁgure 4 . 10 . Subsequently , the following entities have been created . They are : users , sessions , projects , require - ments , keywords , bookmarks , documents , contexts , and contextual ﬁles . In order to personalize the search , a ”users” entity has been introduced . This entity allows a unique user to have dedicated search activities . Within the ”users” entity , the ”user id” attribute plays the role of the primary key . For some search engines , the user id value is bonded with the provided user’s email address . To - gether with the ”user password” attribute , the ”user id” attribute is used in the user veriﬁcation process . The ”user id” attribute also acts as a foreign key to the ”sessions” entity which will tell the user the time of the last login and what the last project was . This way , the user will know which uncompleted search activities can be continued . With the purpose of segregating search activities into a compartmentalized design project where the user can have many projects , the ”projects” entity was created . Each design project will be notiﬁed by the primary key of this entity , namely the ”project id” . More information , such as project name and project description , can be stored in the ”project name” and ”project desc” attributes . Moreover , design requirements information is important for design information searches because often the information gathering is began from ﬁnding more in - formation than design requirements demand . Since there are frequently more than one design requirement , a ”requirements” entity was created with the ”project id” playing the role as the foreign key . Meanwhile , the value of one integer ”sharing - project” attribute is used to notify the user if he / she wants to share particular design project information with others or not . If the value is ”yes” , true or ”1” , then other users can ﬁnd search activity information , such as search terms , con - texts , and embedded ﬁles , within the project . In addition , in anticipation of a project being accessed by another user ( for instance , in the case of a design project that has been done by a group of designers ) the ”owner” attribute was added . If 80 SYSTEM CONCEPTUALIZATION 4 . 8 the value of ”user id” is the same as the value of ”owner” , then the user is the creator of the project . This user has authority to change any of the values of the attributes or even delete the data . The complexity of this information design occurs because of three reasons . First , the user’s core activity , namely the information search activity , is a repeti - tive process that should be recognized by a particular project . Since a user may have more than one project and a project can belong to more than one user , the ”works” entity can be used to recognize an active project of a users - projects many - to - many relationship . The attributes of this entity are used to recognize search terms and contexts of a particular project . They act as a foreign key for the ”keywords” and ”contexts” entities below . In addition , this ”works” entity ensures that the search results of a project exclusively belong to a user , even in a joined project . The second complexity this information design addresses is that the system should recognize a search term as individual and unique for a certain context of a certain project . The ”keyword id” is introduced to anticipate the search terms text similarity stored in the ”keyword” attribute . A diﬀerent user might have the same search terms in diﬀerent contexts and diﬀerent projects . A search term for a particular context might have diﬀerent purposes , i . e . diﬀerent lists of URLs or diﬀerent supportive ﬁles . Therefore , each search term must be unique . Every query will be stored within the ”keywords” entity , while their results will be stored in the ”bookmarks” entity because one search term may be relevant to more than one search result . The ”url description” is used to put verbal contexts to a relevant search result . The supportive ﬁle that will be linked with the query will be stored in the ”documents” entity . Because the documents that will be attached are diﬀerent in type and have a diﬀerent way of being loaded , the type will be stored in the ”doc type” attribute in order to make the content easier to load within a ”doc content” attribute . The third complexity can be described by the following example . Two diﬀerent and separate bicycle design projects have contexts within the so - called ”bicycle frame” and ”bicycle wheel” contexts . Within each of these contexts , there is a search term ”stainless steel” with very diﬀerent search results . This complexity will increase when these bicycle projects are executed by a group of independent designers of diﬀerent design teams . Therefore , although the contexts and key - words are recognized by ”works” , each of the ”contexts” and ”keywords” entities have a ”context id” and ”keyword id” correspondingly to handle the similarities . In this fashion , a context including all search terms and their search results can be transferred to a diﬀerent project and a diﬀerent user . Because a search term can appear in two or more diﬀerent contexts , the content of a context listed in search terms is stored in a separate entity called “contextual” to allow for duplication . 4 . 8 INFORMATION DESIGN 81 sessions PK , FK1 user _ id last _ login last _ project users PK user _ id user _ name user _ password contextual FK1 context _ id FK2 keyword _ id documents doc _ name doc _ type doc _ description doc _ content FK1 keyword _ id works PK , FK1 project _ id PK , FK2 user _ id keywords PK keyword _ id keyword FK1 project _ id FK1 user _ id projects PK project _ id project _ name project _ desc sharing _ project Owner bookmarks urlurl _ description FK1 keyword _ id requirements FK1 project _ id requirement contexts PK context _ id context _ name context _ description FK1 project _ id FK1 user _ id Figure 4 . 10 : The information model 82 SYSTEM CONCEPTUALIZATION 4 . 8 4 . 8 Concluding Remarks The deﬁnition of ”context” from chapter 2 , have been used in this system con - ceptualization . Although the system conceptualized in this chapter is generic enough so that the user does not necessarily have to be a designer , it complies to the design process because of four reasons . First of all , it can do a repetitive search process for a design project . Regarding this repetitive search process , the implementation of the ”users” and ”projects” entities give the possibility of having a personalized and compartmentalized search activity . Implementing these entities also makes it possible to implement the concept of ”history” , where the user can stop the search activity and come back again to the exact point where he / she left oﬀ . Second , during this iteration process , every associative search term , with the search results , can be connected in a context . Therefore , the designer can jump from one design focus to another without losing the context . The third and fourth reasons are that this system supports both the uniqueness of the designer and the possibility of a joint project . Each designer can have his or her own search terms and search results , even in a joint project . However , even though every design team member will has his or her own search , and therefore his or her own context , he or she is still able to share with each other . This system is aimed at helping the designer build the above - deﬁned ”context” . Each context itself can grow and trigger a new search , which is also supported by this system . However , the system does not automatically produce or generate any search term or initial knowledge . They are very much dependant on designer experience , understanding and knowledge that diﬀerentiate between the expert and the novice designer as well as each individual user . However , as the ﬁndings in chapter 3 indicate , every designer has their own way or path to ﬁnd the right information that can be accommodated in this system and also shared . Therefore , theoretically , the novice can gain advantages from the expert by using this system . Additionally , this system proposes a new approach on how to minimize vanishing knowledge when a ( senior ) designer leaves a design company . The pilot implementation of the proof - of - concept system for this thesis is re - ported in the next chapter .

It begins with the user speciﬁcation , system and interface requirements speciﬁcations , and a database , followed by the details of the system . While describing the imple - mented system , each of the sections will construct ideas to address each of the sub - research questions listed above . The ﬁrst sub - research question will be ad - dressed in section 5 . 6 and section 5 . 7 . The second , third and fourth will be explored in section 5 . 7 . Section 5 . 8 will concentrate on sub - research questions numbers 5 , 6 , and 7 . 5 . 2 User Speciﬁcation The users of this system are designers who have minimum experience using in - ternet search engines . It is assumed that the users need to complete one or more iterative information searches on the internet , and need to manage the results and the information search processes in a constructive way . It is also assumed that the users will complete individual or collaborative design projects . The users might be willing to use the results and the processes of the informational search in other projects or share this information with other users . 5 . 3 System and Interface Requirements Speciﬁcation From the system’s conceptualization , literature study , and the results of the con - text knowledge study in conceptual design , the speciﬁc implemented system is as follows : 1 . The implemented system is built on existing web search technology and operates in conjunction with a common internet search engine . The idea of this work is not to develop a new search engine . Instead of replacing existing advanced search engines , this system will amplify them to ﬁt the nature of the designers , as well as their projects and purposes . As a prototype , the implemented system will utilize a browser technology component and a popular search engine that supports the chosen programming language . 2 . The implemented system will support the user in building representations of one or many contexts , where each context is a structured set of keywords that contains Uniform Resource Locators ( URLs ) , pictures , and supportive ﬁles , such as oﬃce application documents and media ﬁles . With the phe - nomena of design in practice , design problems needing to be solved or design ideas needing to be elaborated may occur in an iterative information search process using more than one search term . Each of these keywords may show one or more URLs as a result of the particular search . Each of the search terms may also be supported by the user’s existing local computer ﬁles , such as oﬃce documents , pictures , and media ﬁles . 5 . 4 WEB - BASED CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 85 3 . This system will provide an overview of all available contexts in a particular design project and also provide the graphical presentation of any contexts . One way to make the context explicit is to represent it in a graphical rep - resentation . 4 . This system enables the editing of any context ; keywords can be included or deleted , and local or newly retrieved documents can be associated with keywords . 5 . This system encourages the designer to search for information from a con - text selected from existing sources rather than from keywords or stored bookmarks . 6 . This system encourages the designer to spend more time and eﬀort on en - riching existing contexts and / or creating new ones . 7 . This system enables the copying of contexts from preceding and / or shared projects . It also enables the copying of entire projects ( as a starting point of a similar design or a redesign ) . 8 . This system enables the designer to make his / her project sharable with other designers . From the system requirements speciﬁed above , a list of interface requirements is drawn : 1 . The search application interface should contain a common search engine . 2 . The search application interface should allow users to see the list of all queries that have been given by the search engine and show the results . 3 . This system should allow designers to decide for themselves the relevance of each result . 4 . This system should allow the designers to decide for themselves which key - words are within a context . The user should be able to edit the context itself in terms of adding or removing relevant keywords . 5 . This system should allow designers to ﬁnd and attach their local supportive ﬁles onto a particular context . 5 . 4 Web - based Contextual Design Information Retrieval Sys - tem A prototype system has been implemented using a Visual Basic and Java pro - gramming language . The system oﬀers the possibility of managing the queries 86 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 5 and results in a structured way . It also presents the possibility of supporting the designer in building a representation of one or more search contexts . Another key aspect of this system is the possibility of archiving contexts and reusing them in new design projects , thus accelerating the information search process . Fig - ure 5 . 1 gives the overview of the architecture of the implemented system that consists of proﬁle management , dialogue management and context management , while relying on an existing search engine . The next section will describe the implementation of the information design conceptualized in chapter 4 , followed by sections that describe the details of each part of the implemented system . Figure 5 . 1 : Web - based Contextual Information Retrieval Architecture 5 . 5 System Database The MSAccess database management system has been chosen to implement this information design . The numbers on the tables that have been created are as much an entity in information design as any other component , but some details to the attributes have been added . The users and project tables play a key role in determining how to personalize the search process . The combination of the primary keys from these two tables is to ensure that each information search process carried out on the internet is unique . Since the relationship between 5 . 6 SYSTEM DATABASE 87 these two tables is many - to - many , where a user can have many projects and a project can belong to many users ( for example , when they are developing the design project together ) , a table called ”works” , shown in ﬁgure 5 . 2 , is a kind of index allowing the query to be unique and expectantly faster . Likewise , with other relationships in this database , many diﬃculties arise because of the many - to - many relationships . For example , an information search in a project can have many search terms ( located in table ”keywords” ) and contexts , while a search term might appear in more than one context . Similar to this , a bookmarked search result and a user’s embedded document might appear in more than one search term . Figure 5 . 2 : Implemented database Because of the above facts and what has been discussed in 4 . 7 , in order to personalize an information search process , the system should not only uniquely identify who is the user , and in what project design he is now working , but should also identify each of the supplied search terms . The possibility of duplicating search results and user - embedded documents in an information search process should be a trade - oﬀ with the need for unique identiﬁcation . 88 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 6 5 . 6 Proﬁle Management The proﬁle management maintains the data of the users as well as their ( design ) project data . Therefore , the information search process in this system will always associate with a particular ( design ) project that belongs to an individual user ( designer ) through dialogue management . In this way , the system can be person - alized in accordance with the chosen search engine . In other words , each user will have his / her own design projects and each of the projects will have an individual information search process . This proﬁle management controls the login system , user , and project proﬁle modules . 5 . 6 . 1 Login system and User Proﬁle Modules In order to use this system , the user must log onto the system . If the user uses the system for the ﬁrst time and has not become a registered user , he or she must sign up ﬁrst . When a user ﬁrst registers , a user proﬁle will be created . The user should then provide a self - chosen user identiﬁcation ( ID ) and password . Other contact details , such as aﬃliation and email addresses , may also be provided by the user . Each time the user logs onto the system , the system will seek to match the userID and password combination from the stored user proﬁles in the system’s database . 5 . 6 . 2 Project Module This module is central to the implemented system . This module is divided into sub - modules where the user can see what design projects have been done , and the collaborative design projects in which the user is participating . Here the designer can also create a new project , edit a project proﬁle , complete internet searches for such projects , create and manage the contexts of a particular project and ﬁnd and copy useful contexts from other projects . In this module , a user will be provided with two kinds of project lists as shown in Figure 5 . 3 . On the left hand side , the user will ﬁnd a list of any design projects that he created before ( as an individual or a team leader ) . On the right hand side is the list of projects in which the user is participating , if any . To begin a search process , users will select a project from the list and execute it . Project Proﬁle To manage the information search activities based on a project and to integrate the information search process and its results with other project documents , the users can create an information search project as same as his or her design project’s naming system . When a user creates a project , the user can type in any initial keyword for that project in the menu shown in Figure 5 . 4 . The initial keyword or combination of keywords or sentences are any keywords that appear 5 . 7 DIALOGUE MANAGEMENT 89 Figure 5 . 3 : Project menu in the users’ mind before they actually begin the information search process . The user may also decide whether or not to share the information search contexts of a project . When a project is created , the project proﬁle will be stored in the project database . This proﬁle can be maintained using the project proﬁle sub - module . The information about a project , such as project goals , project requirements , and types of products , will be maintained . 5 . 7 Dialogue Management The dialogue management actually interfaces the users with the existing search engine and keeps the queries and results tractable . The other role of the dialogue management is to connect the users’ supportive ﬁles to the appropriate search queries . 5 . 7 . 1 Search Module This module is at the core of the implementation system . In this module , an existing search engine is utilized . The user will use the search engine as usual . Any of the features available from the search engine will be available to the user . In addition , this module will capture the query text ( keywords , combination of keywords , or sentences ) and write it into a “history” memory before it is passed to the search engine running on the internet browser . When necessary , the text in the memory can be passed to the search engine . In return , the search engine will display a list of URLs as a result of the passed query . The memory will be ﬂushed whenever the module is closed . Instead of going to the location of the 90 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 7 Figure 5 . 4 : Project proﬁle clicked URL , a pop - up window will appear to show the internet site . It is then the decision of the user to determine the relevance of the site . If the user decides to keep the chosen internet site , both the query text and the URL text will be stored in the “Keywords” and “Bookmarks” tables . Whenever a query text is loaded from the database , it will be passed on to the search engine . In addition , all lists of internet sites , bookmarked URLs , pictures , and documents will be loaded . This process is shown in ﬁgure 5 . 5 and details of this module process will be described in the next sub - sections . Search Engine Utilization To utilize a search engine , a web browser component and text box must be placed in a visual basic form . Whenever the search module is executed , this form will be loaded and will call the web browser component . The empty web browser component will be initiated by a chosen search engine web address and then locked 5 . 7 DIALOGUE MANAGEMENT 91 Figure 5 . 5 : Search module process to avoid a direct search through the search engine . The search term typed by the user in the textbox will be taken as a search argument value . After encoding this search argument into a form that is accepted by the chosen search engine , a complete URL that contains the search engine address and search argument will be composed . This URL will be called by the activated web browser by using the ”Navigate2” method . In return , a list of search results will be shown by the web browser . The general algorithm of this process can be seen in algorithm 5 . 1 and the example of the search engine utilization subroutine is shown in code 5 . 1 . Algorithm 5 . 1 search engine utilization Load the form Initiated the web browser with search engine address Initiate text - box with null value Read the text - box value Encode the value Compose a complete URL Call the URL with " Navigate2 " method Unlike using the search engine directly , this system will not redirect the web browser to the clicked search result , but rather will load a pop - up window called the result browser window that consists of a web browser . The user can still see all of the listed search results while checking a clicked search result . After checking 92 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 7 the search results in the result browser window , the user can decide to bookmark the result or not . More details about bookmarking activities will be described in the next sub - section . Sub StartGoogleSearch ( searchString ) Dim url As String , searchArgs As String searchArgs = Replace ( Trim ( searchString ) , " " , " + " ) ’compose complete url url = " http : / / www . google . com / search ? hl = en & lr = & ie = UTF - 8 & safe = off & q = " + searchArgs ’for yahoo ’url = " http : / / search . yahoo . com / search ? p = " + searchArgs + " & prssweb = Search & ei = UTF - 8 & fr = FP - tab - web - t400 & x = wrt " ’navigate to the page ! WebBrowser1 . Navigate2 url Exit _ StartGoogleSearch : Exit Sub Err _ StartGoogleSearch : MsgBox Err . Description Resume Exit _ StartGoogleSearch End Sub Code 5 . 1 : Search engine utilization subroutine A requisite of the system conceptualization in chapter 4 is that the imple - mented system should represent the search engine as it is and should allow the user to see and use all available features that belong to the search engine and web browser . In other words , the embedded search engine’s features must be available for use . In order to diﬀerentiate between the click on a search result that triggers the loading of the result browser window and other clicks that enable the use of a search engine’s features , an ”intelligent” check procedure has been added . Only a double click on a URL listed in the search results will trigger a result browser window to appear ; otherwise , it will be considered an action of the search engine or web browser . Details on this procedure are shown in code 5 . 2 . History and Bookmark As already brieﬂy mentioned in section 5 . 7 . 1 , the search terms written in the text box are not only passed to the search engine , but also have been sent to a temporary history list as shown in ﬁgure 5 . 6 . This temporary memory is used to catch user’s “trial - and - error” and “mind jump” from one topic to another , as a tool for the user to keep track of his / her searches . If these right , relevant , “wrong” or “irrelevant” search terms should be revisited , the user can again select the term and the system will pass the information to the search engine to again search for results . Technically , each time the search module sends the search term text from the text box to the search engine , it sends this text to a listbox as well . A double - click on one of these listed search terms will activate the search engine to search for information on the internet and present the search results based on the clicked 5 . 7 DIALOGUE MANAGEMENT 93 Private Sub WebBrowser1 _ BeforeNavigate2 ( ByVal pDisp As Object , url As Variant , Flags As Variant , TargetFrameName As Variant , PostData As Variant , Headers As Variant , Cancel As Boolean ) On Error Resume Next If InStr ( url , " google . com " ) = 0 Or InStr ( url , " google . com / url " ) > 0 Then ’for yahoo ’If InStr ( url , " yahoo . com " ) = 0 Or InStr ( url , " yahoo . com / url " ) > 0 Then Cancel = True ’open secondary browser ResultBrowserForm .

Close End If End Sub Code 5 . 2 : Result browser window text . Since these search terms listed in the listbox are represented as “short memory” in this information search process , they will be cleared whenever the search module is closed . Contrastingly , the bookmark system is a representation of a “long term” mem - ory . When the user bookmarks one of the search results , it means he / she aﬃrms that the bookmarked search result is relevant to the design process , and therefore both the search term and selected search result need to be stored in the system database as an intellectual asset . Before showing the selected URL , the system will ﬁrst check if the search term has been previously stored . The system will only store the search term once , when the ﬁrst URL from a particular query is bookmarked . If the search term does exist in the database , the system will then check to see if the URL has been stored before as a particular associated search term . If so , then the system will only show the result and will not complete a pre - store process . Otherwise , only a pre - store process for a URL , or for both the search term and URL , will be executed when the user clicks the ”bookmark” 94 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 7 Figure 5 . 6 : Captured and saved keywords button . In the pre - store process , the system will access the “keywords” and “book - mark” tables of the CDIRS database and collect sets of records called recordsets from those two tables by executing Sequel Query Language ( SQL ) commands . The system will then do a quick seek to ﬁnd the search term . If the search term does not exist , then the system will create a unique identiﬁcation ( ID ) for the search term and for the URL , or the system will only create an ID for the non - existing URL . The system will then start a data store process to write the search term ID , search term text , URL ID , and URL text to the recordset . By using the data transaction methods , the system will only physically transfer the data to the database if there is no error and the process can be completed ; otherwise it will cancel the transaction . After a successful transaction , the recordset will be closed and the memory will be released . By following this procedure , the system can keep the data integrity in the physical database . When a bookmark has been successfully created , the search term will be dis - played in a combo box ( a list box that only displays a single item at the ﬁrst item index ) . Only the latest stored search term will be displayed in the combo box , while all relevant URLs will be displayed in a list box as shown in ﬁgure 5 . 6 . Every time that a URL from the list is clicked , the information ( web site ) will be displayed in a pop - up window screen . 5 . 7 DIALOGUE MANAGEMENT 95 Each one of the stored search terms in the combo box is linked with the search results , the list of bookmarked URLs and the list of a user’s relevant documents , such as electronic pictures / drawings , MS Oﬃce ﬁles , and multimedia ﬁles . Once the user selects the combo box and chooses another search term , the search engine will update the search results based on the chosen search term and a list of bookmarked relevant URLs from the particular displayed search term will be shown . The user’s embedded ﬁles will then be listed on a multi - tab pad as can be seen in ﬁgure 5 . 6 . Essentially , every stored search term builds a very low context deﬁnition , namely , a connection between a search term , relevant search results , and a user’s relevant ﬁles from the “outside” of the system environment . More details concerning a user’s documents will be given in the next sub subsection . User’s Embedded Documents As previously mentioned , this system allows the user to link electronic documents to a particular search term . The assumption is that the user might want to use the same keyword to ﬁnd information on the internet or to ﬁnd his local document . The other assumption made for this system implementation is that the user might want to enrich information from internet search results with his local documents or vice versa . These embedded documents might be available in many formats , such as a note , a drawing , a physical model , a book etc . However , it is possible to transfer this format to an electronic format . This can be categorized into three types , namely , pictures , oﬃce documents , and multimedia ( sounds and moving pictures ) as shown in ﬁgure 5 . 7 . In order to embed the documents into the system , a browsing menu has been created . This menu will appear as a pop - up window when the “add picture” , “add document” or “add media” buttons in the multitab pad are clicked . Basically , this browsing menu contains browsing tools like “Explorer” in MS windows , where the user can deﬁne the “drive” and “directory” of the user’s document ﬁle as illustrated in ﬁgure 5 . 7 . Based on the above three categories , a list of ﬁltered documents will be shown in the ﬁle list box . This ﬁltering system is depicted in code 5 . 3 below . To quickly view a selected ﬁle , the user must click one of the ﬁles listed in the ﬁle list box . The user will then be able to see the selected picture or document or play selected media ﬁles . The user may also want to add some additional text as a remark to the ﬁle , such as why it is important to be embedded in a particular search term . This ﬁle will be stored in the database and will be loaded to the multitab pad in the search menu when the user clicks the ”open” button . Otherwise , if no quick view or comments are listed on a document ﬁle , then a double click to a ﬁle name listed in the ﬁle list box will complete the same operation as clicking the “open” button . The browsing windows will automatically unload whenever the embedding process is successfully implemented . Storing and loading a picture , an oﬃce document or a media ﬁle categorized as a binary data type is completed using a diﬀerent process than other types of 96 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 7 Figure 5 . 7 : User’s Files Inclusion Private Sub Form _ Load ( ) ’Adding User document ActiveAddDocumentTrigger = True If DocumentTrigger = " pic " Then Frame1 .

A binary data type needs a streaming process in order to store or to load a binary data type to and from a recordset . In order to do so , a “stream” object that represents the binary text data needs to be constructed . Because this stream object is constructed for streaming the binary data , the stream type needs to be set as “adTypeBinary” . The process of embedding a user’s local document ﬁle can be described as follows . First , a recordset will be opened and a new row of data will be added . Next , the chosen embedded ﬁle will be loaded to an open stream object using the “LoadFromFile” method . To assign the binary data from the stream object to the ﬁeld in the recordset , the “read” method is used and then the stream object will be closed . Meanwhile , the streaming process to load the binary data from a recordset is slightly diﬀerent . Before it can be loaded to a viewer in the ﬁle browsing window or multitab pad in the search menu , the binary data will be assigned to an open stream object by using the “write” method and then will be saved into a temporary ﬁle by using the “savetoﬁle” method . This temporary ﬁle will actually be loaded into the viewer . Each of these temporary ﬁles are diﬀerent in how they will be loaded and represented to the user as it is illustrated in code 5 . 4 . After the loading process of the viewer into a browsing window or multitab pad in the search menu has been completed , the temporary ﬁle ( MyTempPictureFile or MyTempDocFile or MyTempMediaFile ) will be deleted . The diﬀerence in how a user’s embedded ﬁle loaded to CDIRS as can be seen in code 5 . 4 depends on its type . A static image will be loaded into an image container , and an oﬃce ﬁle will be loaded into an OLE ( object linked embedded ) container . Meanwhile , moving pictures and sound will be played in a media ﬁle . In addition , since more than one picture , oﬃce or media ﬁle can be embedded into a single search term , a record locator is placed in each tab . This record locator can move from one record to the next or to the previous record and also allows jumping to the ﬁrst or the last record . However , since most oﬃce or media ﬁles involve large bytes and therefore require more computer memory capacity , only the header of the record will be moved to the record locator . This ﬁle will only be loaded when the user clicks the “load” command for the oﬃce ﬁle and “play” button for the media ﬁle . Unlike a picture or media ﬁle that easily ﬁts into a picture container or media player no matter how big the ﬁle , an oﬃce ﬁle cannot be properly viewed in a small OLE container . However , this technology allows the ﬁle to be opened in a computer program in which the ﬁle can be viewed properly . An example would include a Microsoft ® Oﬃce Word ﬁle that is embedded into a user’s search term . This ﬁle would be opened in its original format in Microsoft ® Oﬃce Word whenever the user double - clicks the OLE container . This ﬁle will go back into the OLE container whenever the user closes Microsoft ® Oﬃce Word . 98 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 8 5 . 8 Context Management As mentioned in 5 . 7 . 1 , each search term in the “search” sub - modules contains structured URLs , pictures , and documents that have a meaningful relationship with each other . However , at the higher level or at the level of search terms , they are unstructured and therefore contextless . Contrarily , in practice a designer might have more than one keywords for a design problem or a design idea to be searched in order to receive complete information . Consequently , these keywords are connected in the designer’s mind . This implemented search system allows de - signers to implement their own connections between all search terms in particular contexts . The context management is responsible for building , visualizing and manipu - lating the contexts in internet design information searches of a particular design project . The sub - module “context editor” is responsible for creating a context . Once a context has been made , it can be modiﬁed or deleted as will be detailed in 5 . 8 . 1 . Although making an explicit context out of a design information search is important , more importantly is how to visualize the context and transfer it in a necessary case . A context visualization sub - module that handles the process of visualizing the connection of two or more search terms for a particular context will be described in 5 . 8 . 2 . In the case of designs created by teams , a design team member may want to copy a context from other member , or a user may want to use a context from a previous design project . In this case , the context search and copy process is possible through the “context search and copy” sub - module that will be described in 5 . 8 . 3 . 5 . 8 . 1 Context Editor In this sub - module , a user is able to create a context by deﬁning the context name and a text description of the context . The name and the description should represent the design problem or design idea . All available search terms will be shown and the user may want to choose at least two of them before a context will be created . Before the user chooses one of these search terms and , if necessary , puts it into a context , the user can visualize the lower level context where the connection between the search term , the relevant URLs and the user’s embedded ﬁles are shown . This visualization will be described in more detail in the next subsection . Once these contexts are created , they can be edited or even deleted by the user . By then , the user may want to add more search terms into a context or even remove a search term from a context . In many cases , the user might want to use a context from another project or user . Therefore , it is possible to either copy the full context or part of it . In the case of partial copying , the user can edit the context and delete unnecessary search terms . This “context editor” sub - module is available in the “project” module and in the “search” module .

The user also might want to have a visualization of the stored context or search terms in order to not lose the “context” for ﬁnding information because the process is postponed . Therefore , this “context editor” sub - module is located in the “project” module that appears when a revisited user is successfully logged onto the system . Oth - erwise , if the user wants to build a context during a search process , the “context editor” is also available in the “search” module . 5 . 8 . 2 Context Visualization Since the contexts are constructed in a hierarchical way , the visualization of con - texts has granularity as shown in ﬁgure 4 . 2 . At the ”project” level , this module will show the contexts of a project , while at the ”context” level , this module will show a list of keywords . At the lowest level , a keyword will show lists of URLs and a user’s embedded documents . The visualization will increase the explicit - ness of the context , and will give the user instantaneous results in order to do any necessary editing or adding .

A Java applet will be used to change the parameters in an HTM ﬁle before it will be executed in the web browser , as illustrated in code 5 . 5 . This java applet has been developed to interactively display these visualizations , allowing the user to rearrange , select and modify the information at hand . The applet is capable of rendering and creating an arbitrary layout of large intercon - nected graphs and allowing two - way communication with its surrounding client . In our implementation , an inspector pane on the right side of the visualization was built in a Visual Basic form to display and edit details of the selected com - ponent . Each visualization is fed by one or multiple SQL queries . The CDIRS entities are mapped to diﬀerent visual elements , for example , URLs are shown via little thumbnails of the actual website ( automatically generated by CDIRS in the bookmarking function ) , while documents , contexts , keywords and projects each have diﬀerent basic shapes and colors . In order to cope with large quantities of data , the graph visualization uses a ﬁsheye lens distortion . Items in the center are displayed in full , while their size is decreased when dragged to the sides . This enables the presentation of all elements at the same time . For the purpose of this research and regarding its size , only the context and the details of the search term visualization have been implemented and tested . In the future , it may be possible to have the visualization at the project level , the reverse relationship of the search term and context ( the visualization of all contexts which are search terms are included ) , and all context of a particular shared project implemented as it is already prepared in the code . In the situation when the user wants to see the details of a search term be - fore deciding to include it into a context as portrayed in the subsection 5 . 8 . 1 , the updateJavaGraph subroutine will select the cKeywordDetails case . For this case , the SQL command will be executed to retrieve the search term and all URLs and embedded documents regarding the search term . Otherwise , if the user wants to visualize a context , the updateJavaGraph subroutine will select the cContextKey - words case . Therefore , the SQL command will retrieve all search terms related to the speciﬁc context and deﬁne their relationship before completing the same procedure in detailing the search terms as mentioned before . The representation of such search term detail and context visualization is depicted in ﬁgure 5 . 8 . A context is represented by an oval , while a search term is represented by a box . For a detail search term , each URL is represented by its screenshot thumbnail , while embedded documents are represented by icons , depending on their type , including pictures , oﬃce ﬁles and media . The relationships among all of these entities are deﬁned by lines . On the right - hand side of the web browser , the description of each entity can be found when the user selects it . For example , in the ﬁrst example of ﬁgure 5 . 8 , when the user clicks the URL’s thumbnail , the details of this URL are shown and the user is able to visit the URL by clicking the ”open” button . As mentioned above , all of the URLs’ thumbnails have been created by exe - cuting an embedded OLE Control eXtension , or OCX , in the web browser of the browser pop - up window that shows the results of the bookmarking process . Once 102 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 8 ( a ) Search term detail visualization ( b ) Context visualization Figure 5 . 8 : Context visualization 5 . 9 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT 103 a URL is successfully stored in the database , the capturescreen OCX ﬁle will be executed to capture the active screen of the web browser and save it as an image ﬁle as illustrated in code 5 . 6 .

WebBrowser1 . SetFocus winhandle = GetFocus f = CaptureScreen1 . CaptureSpecificScreen ( winhandle , fname , JPG , False , 92 , 92 ) End If Code 5 . 6 : Create thumbnail 5 . 8 . 3 Context Search and Copy The “context search and copy” sub - module allows a user to ﬁnd and copy the right and necessary contexts from other users or other projects . In this sub - module , the user either wants to browse all available contexts from other users or projects , or ﬁnd it within categories , for example , a type of product category . However , other users can only copy the context if the owner decides to share the context . The decision to share the context or not is made by the owner of a new design project in the “project creator” sub - module . However , for a design project that is executed by a team of designers , one of the team members , usually the team leader who creates the design project , must make sure to click the “share” option to allow other members to have access to the context . When a user chooses a project by clicking the projectID in the shared project list , all contexts and individual search terms that belong to the project will be shown as depicted in ﬁgure 5 . 9 . Both contexts and individual search terms have the ability to be visualized in order to ensure the user that chosen contexts or individual search terms are correct . Since a search term can appear in more than one context and a context can appear in more than one project , each search term and context must be unique . When a user copies a context from another project or from other projects belong - ing to another user , the system will give this context a new context identiﬁcation ( ID ) and each search term ID will be replaced with a new one . Accordingly , all of the relevant URLs and a user’s embedded ﬁles from each search term in a context will also be copied . Unnecessary search terms can be removed from a context in the context editor sub - module , while unnecessary URLs and embedded doc - uments can be deleted directly from the list when the user executes the search term in the “search” module . 104 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 10 Figure 5 . 9 : Search and copy context 5 . 9 Structured modules list The general overview of the system is broken down and sharpened into structured modules and sub - modules . Each module or sub - module is a reﬂection of a spe - ciﬁc function of the implemented system and together they construct the general function mentioned in CDIRS . For example , User Proﬁle and Project Proﬁle are two modules that construct the Proﬁle Management . As shown in ﬁgure 5 . 10 , these structured modules and sub - modules are listed as follows : 5 . 10 Modules Interaction This section describes the relationship and interaction between modules and sub - modules . The modules and sub - modules of the implemented system will interact with each other , representing the general functions as described in section 5 . 4 . 5 . 10 MODULES INTERACTION 105 Login User Profile Project Project Creator Search Context Editor New Project Project Profile Copy Context or query Join Project Initial queries Results Relevant Results Supportive Documents Context creation queries Context Visualization Keywords Visualization History Accurate Queries Figure 5 . 10 : The structured content list 106 THE CONTEXTUAL DESIGN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM 5 . 10 5 . 10 . 1 User Proﬁle , Project Proﬁle and Search Interaction When a user logs into CDIRS , the user proﬁle module will seek the combination of the provided user ID and password in the database . Users giving IDs that do not exist or are a wrong combination of user - ID passwords will be asked to sign - up as a new user or exit the system . Figure 5 . 11 shows that a new user must deliver user proﬁle information to the system before creating a new project proﬁle . For a returning user , he or she can continue to work on one of the users’ unﬁnished projects that is listed in the project proﬁle sub - module . The user will be provided with information by the user proﬁle module about the latest working project and time / date of the last successful login . Should the user need to create a new project , it will be possible to create one through the project creator sub - module . When the user creates a new project , requirements and information on the project ID , project name , project description and project goal will be stored . The user will also have an opportunity to put any “initial keywords” in the project creator that will be used in the search sub - module . The user can also decide whether or not to share the context . Once the project is created , the user can begin an internet information search , or if the user wants to continue a listed project , the user can select and execute this command . 5 . 10 . 2 Project Creator , Search and Context Editor Interaction Before the user actually starts retrieving information from the internet via the search sub - module , the user will be given a chance to collect potential query texts ( keywords , or a combination of keywords or sentences ) that are already on the user’s mind based on his or her knowledge , experiences , or information regarding the design task ( design goal , description , type of product , and requirements ) when a project is created . In chapter 3 , this is called initial knowledge . This refers to any knowledge held by the user at the time before the search is begun . These initial query texts ( or initial keywords , initial combination of keywords , or initial sentences ) will be sent to search sub - modules by the sub - module project creator ( see Figure 5 . 12 ) . In a sub - module search , the search engine will retrieve the information from the internet and present the results to the user . The user can then decide on the relevance of the results . From these iterative search processes , the user might want to reﬁne the query text , or may have a new idea on a better query text based on the represented results . The user can also delete the query text if the results are not relevant . When a reﬁned query text or a new query text is entered , the search module will record them in the history memory . If necessary , the user can pick one of these recorded query texts for retrieving information from the internet . For the duration of the retrieval of information from the internet in the search sub - module , the user actually not only gain any knowledge from the incoming in - 5 . 10 MODULES INTERACTION 107 User Profile User login into CDIRS User sign up as a new user Un - existing user Project Profile User create new design project Project Creator Search User start the information search process Internet User continue the design project User type in the initial knowledge Figure 5 . 11 : User proﬁle , project proﬁle and search modules interaction formation of the search result , but also will develop contexts among the individual query texts .

However , this context is still implicit to the user . To make this context explicit , the user can connect at least two query texts and give it a context name and description within the context creator sub - module . It is possible for the user to visualize each query text ( keyword - URLs - pictures - documents - media ﬁles ) before the user puts it into a particular context . Once the context is created , it can be shared and visualized . 5 . 11 Concluding Remark The proﬁle management allows the system to personalize search engines , and thus the information obtained in the search process . In this way , a designer , or a group of designers for a project , have their own search processes . If the search terms are the manifestation of the user’s knowledge and the search paths are the user’s emerging context knowledge , then the personalization of this search process can play a big role in design knowledge management . It then becomes possible to store the manifestation of the designer’s knowledge . Moreover , if the search paths are built from a designer’s experience , a novice designer may learn from a designer with more expertise by accessing stored context knowledge . The use of the pop - up window screen is to keep the user in “context” with the 5 . 11 CONCLUDING REMARK 109 search process . The parentheses around the word context are used to distinguish the term from the technical terminology in this chapter 4 . When a user accesses a search engine in a conventional way , the screen will redirect to the web site of the clicked URL from the search results . In one way or another , the user will lose his context of the search process when he / she cannot see the search term or the search results , because it is situated in diﬀerent environment . This proposed system allows the user to move freely from one search term , access past search terms in the history , bookmark search terms or URLs , as well as ensure that the user will be able to stay in the same place with his / her information search processes . The user also can still in context and continue the unﬁnished search or a revisited search process . As the designer usually keeps important hard copies of information and doc - uments of such design projects in a particular folder . This implemented system oﬀers the possibility to connect a search term in an internet information search process and the electronic version of the supported documents that exist from other parts of the design process , such as brain storming notes , sketches , oﬃce ﬁles . This way of treating important information and documents may potentially oﬀer a solution to the well - known lateen design or other knowledge management problems , including how to get the right information at the right time and at the right place . Furthermore , in this thesis , the “context” is technically deﬁned as the re - lationship between two or more search terms that are meaningful for the user . Therefore , this kind of context is very explicit , even to another user when it is transferred . However , the level of its explicitness can increase by adding some text for notiﬁcation , comments or visualization . This system supports the as - sumption that allows the user to comment when embedding a local documents ﬁle to a search term and build a new context , but also represents the relationship between inter - search terms and search terms - URLs - embedded ﬁles in a graphical representation . At this moment , there are three types of user electronic documents that can be embedded into the implemented system . These are the types that are most likely obtainable in the early design phase . For instance , a scanned user’s conceptual paper - pen drawing ﬁle , a word brainstorming notice ﬁle , a spreadsheet budget and schedule ﬁle , and a multimedia animation ﬁle are possible examples of a connection with a search process . However , since most of the computer programs that run in Microsoft ® Windows operating systems include most of the 3 - D design computer programs recognizable to the OLE technology , it may be possible in the future to embed these kinds of ﬁles into a search process , or vice versa . All sub - research questions listed at the beginning of this chapter have been answered during the explanation of this implemented web - based design informa - tion retrieval system , and can be considered as added values to the conventional internet search system . Chapter 6 System Life - Cycle Illustration and Evaluation ”There can be no literary equivalent to truth . ” - Laura Riding 6 . 1 Introduction In chapter 4 and chapter 5 , the concept of the system and how it technically works were described . This chapter has a more practical nature and attempts to illustrate how this system can be applied in a very early design stage project . There are two design project cases that will be illustrated . These cases will demonstrate how the context can be built and how the context can be useful for other designers or other design projects . In the end , these two cases were also used during the evaluation of the CDIRS system by several members of academia and industrial practitioner experts . 6 . 2 System Life - Cycle Illustration 2 There are several points of emphasis in this system life cycle illustration , includ - ing the following : ( a ) describing the system using step - by - step instructions , ( b ) showing how context can be built , ( c ) showing how context can be shared and 2 This illustration is built - up partly from the observation of several participants who volun - teered to simulate the same assignments as mentioned in this chapter with and without using CDIRS . Some pictures used in this illustration have already been appeared in chapter 5 . 111 112 SYSTEM LIFE - CYCLE ILLUSTRATION AND EVALUATION 6 . 2 useful for other designers or other projects , ( d ) subsequent points and ( e ) how a novice designer can learn from an experienced designer . This illustration will not include all of the steps entailed in using CDIRS , such as the logon and entering project proﬁles , but rather , will focus on information searches and context building / manipulating . 6 . 2 . 1 The Design Assignments The ﬁrst given assignment was to design yogurt packaging for a mobile and busy person with the following requirements : • Light and easy to be carried • Aﬀordable price • Environmentally friendly • Easy to manufacture The second design assignment was to design a garden chair for an area with four seasons that can withstand the extreme climate changes with the following requirements : • Light and movable • Aﬀordable price • Environmentally friendly • Easy to manufacture 6 . 2 . 2 Context Building From the requirements , the designer intuitively could think and want to ﬁnd solutions for several topics and aspects – termed as initial knowledge – such as : • Materials • Users / customers • Tools needed to design • Manufacturing possibilities For the materials topic , the designer might want to search for : • Light material : carton , aluminium , plastic • Green material 6 . 2 SYSTEM LIFE - CYCLE ILLUSTRATION 2 113 • Recycleable material • Cheap material For the users / customers topic , the designer might want to search for : • User habits • Local tradition / culture • Local climate • Local food These topics should remain in the designer’s mind and might diﬀer from one to another . To start an information search , a designer can start with any topic , possible solution or search query . The user does not have to have structures in action because all typed queries will be recorded in the short memory recorder , allowing he or she to freely jump backward or forward . Meanwhile , the designer should not be afraid that all of his or her search results will be automatically permanently recorded ; unlike existing search engine features , the search terms and results will only be recorded if the designer decides to record them . Although he or she might think about the previous material , any search term coming to his or her mind could be directly typed into the search box , as can be seen in Figure 6 . 1 , where the designer discovered the ”bottle type packaging” idea . Figure 6 . 1 : Information search starts The designer will then have to decide from the listed search results which are relevant , based on his or her judgement , as can be seen in Figure 6 . 2 . 114 SYSTEM LIFE - CYCLE ILLUSTRATION AND EVALUATION 6 . 2 Figure 6 . 2 : Designer’s relevant judgement With a list of bookmarked search results , a designer might want to add his or her pictures or ﬁles to certain related keywords , as illustrated in Figure 6 . 3 . At this point , the designer can begin to build the lowest level of context , namely , connected keywords , bookmarked relevant URLs , and the user’s ﬁles . Figure 6 . 3 : Designer’s local document inclusion 6 . 2 SYSTEM LIFE - CYCLE ILLUSTRATION 2 115 With a list of recorded individual keywords , the designer might want to build a higher level of context , namely a group of keywords that are meaningful or have certain topics in common , for example , user habits , formgiving , climate , and the culture , as partly depicted in Figure 6 . 4 . ( a ) User’s habits context ( b ) Formgiving context Figure 6 . 4 : Context building In the end , the designer might want to visualize the context , and from there , each of the URLs can be checked and the context can be changed / edited , as can be seen in Figure 6 . 5 . 116 SYSTEM LIFE - CYCLE ILLUSTRATION AND EVALUATION 6 . 3 Figure 6 . 5 : Context visualization 6 . 2 . 3 Context Use In the previous subsection , the nature of context building was illustrated . In this subsection , the second example , the ”garden chair” design assignment , will be used to illustrate the use and manipulation of available context . When the ﬁrst and second design assignment are compared , some topics are almost the same , although they are diﬀerent in product types , for instance , both require to search information about ”material” . Therefore the designer might think that some earlier design project recorded information could be useful . Before copying the available contexts from the ﬁrst assignment ( see : Figure 6 . 6 ) , the designer might want to reviewed it ﬁrst by visualize the contexts or each of the search terms . This only possible if the contexts have been shared by the owner . After reviewing them , the designers may decide to copy the ”Dutch Culture” and ”climate” contexts for the garden chair / furniture design assignment . When copying the context , all keywords within that context , including all URLs and user’s ﬁles , are also copied , as can be seen in Figure 6 . 7 . Designers might then delete or add other URLs and ﬁles for such keywords . Of course , it is also possible to delete or add keywords from a certain context . 6 . 3 SYSTEM EVALUATION 117 Figure 6 . 6 : Review and copy contexts 6 . 3 System Evaluation In section 6 . 2 , the design case examples and possible situations of how the pro - posed system can be used and support designers have been illustrated . This section reports the evaluation of the proposed CDIRS . This evaluation is not intended to evaluate the usability of the developed sys - tems , but rather to evaluate the implementation of the concept of ”context” and its applicability in a design project . The reason behind this is that the full usabil - ity test would reserve a lot of eﬀort and take a lot of time out of the limitation of this research . Meanwhile , doing so would give no guarantee that the concept of ”context” and other proposed information searches in earlier design phase im - provements could be evaluated and better revealed . Hence , this evaluation should ﬁnd an acceptable number of participants and evaluation time , while it should also represent the opinions of design communities and situations . If the participants are not familiar with the system , this could hinder their best opinions on such matters of interest or hinder them from seeing the possible cases that could happen in real life . Furthermore , if the participant does not realize the possible situations that could help in real life , they will not be able to give an educated opinion on the system or may not be aware of system advancements . 118 SYSTEM LIFE - CYCLE ILLUSTRATION AND EVALUATION 6 . 3 Figure 6 . 7 : Having copied contexts , search terms , and continued the search 6 . 3 . 1 Evaluation Strategies and Methods An evaluation panel , consisting of experts that either have academic or industrial experience , was formed . The assumption was made that academic experts will be theoretically stronger , while industrial practicing experts will be more familiar with novel and practicing design issues . This demonstration will mainly focus on the analysis phase of design because it is assumed that in this phase , a lot of design information retrieval from internet activities will occur . These experts will have a demonstration of the CDIRS application on two design cases . The demonstration will include the following functions : 1 . Search for information and optional context building , 2 . Use of context from another user , which may or may not share the project . This demonstration will overcome the problems of ”unfamiliar” practices , and at the same time , give an overview of the system’s capabilities and the ”context” theory behind it . After the demonstration , experts may have a chance to gain hands - on experience of the system by using it to complete their own fake design project , with researchers standing by to oﬀer assistance . If necessary , could search for information on their real design project ”live” . However , the demonstration is designed to be enough for experts to develop an opinion without using the system . 6 . 3 SYSTEM EVALUATION 119 From each expert , the following will be collected : 1 . Data about his / her background and experience in design and information retrieval , 2 . Opinions about existing search engines , 3 . Expectations for a future ( to - be ) search engine 4 . Opinions about CDIRS’ utility and eﬃciency in regards to context building , context usage and context sharing , 5 . Expected key beneﬁts , 6 . Expected key drawbacks and 7 . Suggestions for the CDIRS and for the methodology and research . The assessments will be collected using questionnaires completed by the experts after the demonstration session . 6 . 3 . 2 Evaluation Results Experts’ Proﬁle The concept of context and CDIRS was discussed , presented , and demonstrated before ten experts . The experts were grouped into two groups : members of academia and industrial practitioners . For members of academia , their expertise has been proven by their long - term involvement in design education , research , experience in guiding students’ design projects , or having industry experience be - fore embarking on their careers in academia . Members of academia that were involved in this evaluation are professionals , such as lecturers or senior lecturers at faculty members of the Industrial Design Engineering , Delft University of Tech - nology . The expertise of industrial practitioners was assessed by their long - term involvement in design projects and consultations in the industry . The experts from the industry ranged from small - medium to large international companies , from pure design companies to product data management consultations , and from general design to speciﬁc consumer products design work . The companies that were involved in this evaluation are located in the Netherlands . They include NewProducts , Fabrique , Philips and Philips Design . All of the experts stated that they have experience in consumer products and industrial design projects . While , some of them mentioned experience in automotive and professional products . All of them mentioned that during their design projects , they collect information from multiple sources , such as colleagues , previous design projects’ documentations , other available surrounding documents and the internet . They see themselves not as experts in ﬁnding information from the internet , but as experienced in ﬁnding information from the internet and quite often using 120 SYSTEM LIFE - CYCLE ILLUSTRATION AND EVALUATION 6 . 3 internet search engines for collecting information for their design projects . All of them prefer using the ”Google” search engine to ﬁnd information on the internet . Members of academia also ranked other popular search engines , including the meta search engine ( such as ”mamma” ) , Yahoo , Altavista , and MSN . Meanwhile , practitioners , after Google , preferred Yahoo , Altavista , MSN , and the meta search engine . All of them expect search engines to easily ﬁnd their expected results . Experts’ Opinions on Existing Search Engines As can be seen in Table 6 . 1 , members of academia scored the usefulness of existing search engines in supporting design projects as 3 . 6 out of 5 , while the industrial practitioners scored 3 . 0 or were quite neutral . Table 6 . 1 : Experts’s opinions on the usefulness of existing search engines ( 1 - 5 ; 5 is Very useful ) Group Mean Standard Deviation Academia 3 . 6 0 . 5 Industrial Practitioner 3 . 0 0 . 8 The academic experts thought it easy to ﬁnd relevant information using cur - rent internet search engines , in which they gave a score of 3 . 3 out of 5 . Conversely , the industrial practitioners thought it harder to ﬁnd relevant information using current search engines , reﬂected in their score of 2 . 3 out of 5 , as described in Table 6 . 2 .

With these features , designers could record their information search processes . The experts were di - vided on their opinions in terms of the usefulness and necessity of these features . Members of academia were not in favor , while the industrial practitioners’ views were quite diﬀerent . However , both groups conceded that these feature could be very helpful during the collecting of design information from the internet , as can be seen in Table 6 . 5 .

Below are the results of this questionnaire . Both members of academia and industrial practitioners agreed that it was not a need to embed search engines in a computer - aided design system , as drawn in Table 6 . 6 . Industrial practitioners found dedicated and unique search processes and in - formation search results necessary , while members of academia did not . This fact can be found in Table 6 . 7 . 122 SYSTEM LIFE - CYCLE ILLUSTRATION AND EVALUATION 6 . 3 Table 6 . 6 : Embedding search engines in a CAD ( 1 - 5 ; 5 is ultimately needed ) Group Mean Standard Deviation Academia 2 . 0 1 . 0 Industrial Practitioner 2 . 8 1 . 0 Table 6 . 7 : Dedicated and unique search processes for each design project ( 1 - 5 ; 5 is unique for a project ) Group Mean Standard Deviation Academia 2 . 3 0 . 5 Industrial Practitioner 3 . 6 1 . 5 Both members of academia and industrial practitioners found that it would be useful if the search context could be visualized , as seen in Table 6 . 8 .

Table 6 . 9 : Connection between search results and users’ local digital documents ( 1 - 5 ; 5 is needed and useful ) Group Mean Standard Deviation Academia 3 . 6 0 . 5 Industrial Practitioner 4 . 5 0 . 5 Furthermore , some experts gave their expectations that such features should be included in future search engines verbally and include the following , listed below : Search engines should determine from earlier searches and documents what contexts makes a keyword relevant . Relevant hits are saved , as well as the context in which they were relevant . Search engines should also keep track of successful and bad combinations of keywords and should give advice on better combinations , e . g . when searching for ”clay” , the engine knows from the documents that ”styling clay” is 6 . 3 SYSTEM EVALUATION 123 relevant ; it will exclude ”soil” and ask if Play - doh is to be included or not • Have a high hit rate on design - related topics • Diﬀer between convergent and divergent searches • Easily ﬁnd visual material Guide the process of including relevant search terms and excluding irrelevant ones Search engine : Results are ranked by designers . Descriptions of the pages discuss whether or not one can ﬁnd prices , pictures and expla - nations on how things work , etc . Expert Opinions of CDIRS In general , both members of academia and industrial practitioners found CDIRS helpful , as can be seen in Table 6 . 10 . Table 6 . 10 : General impression on CDIRS ( 1 - 5 ; 5 is needed and useful ) Group Mean Standard Deviation Academia 3 . 3 0 . 5 Industrial Practitioner 3 . 8 0 . 7 one of the experts from the industry included a brief feedback after the demon - stration and is quoted below : I think the application is helpful , but it just requires too many steps , too many interactions and too much organization . All of the good intentions will be lost in a work situation . The key is that it does not block you in working . It surely makes searching and showing the search process easier , but it is the steps before that ; creating the database and maintaining it The industrial practitioner experts reluctantly logged on to the system every time to begin the information start , but members of academia have no problem for that , as shown in Table 6 . 11 .

Meanwhile , industrial practitioner experts found that the most useful feature of CDIRS was its capability to uniquely compartmentalize the search processes into a design project . After that , they found that the users’ document inclusion and keeping the original search engine capabilities were also advancements in CDIRS . In general , both groups of experts suggested that the user interface was not an urgent matter of improvement , as stated in Table 6 . 19 .

Combine internet and intranet searches 6 . 3 . 3 Discussion There are diﬀerent characteristics for design projects in industry and in academics , such as how big the projects are , how tight the deadline is , and how much pressure is present from the market or the competitors . Usually , a design project in the industry is bigger than an academic design project . The time schedule for meeting the deadline is tight and the pressure from the market or competitor is high . This last design project characteristic is not often present in academic projects . This situation is consistently in agreement with [ Court , 1997 ] , where in the end , designers from industry tend to coup the deadline and pressure by not spending much time ﬁnding information , but rather using the information they already possess . The evaluation results on experts’ opinions on existing search engines reﬂect the above fact . Members of academia are assumed to have more time to use search engines to ﬁnd information on the internet . Therefore , they have more apprecia - tion and awareness of the advancements in existing search engines , as long as it directly gives the needed information . On the contrary , for industrial practitioner experts , current search engines are not really helpful in ﬁnding relevant informa - tion . Therefore , they want improvement . Because of their tight time schedules , they tend to seek information rather than explore all possible beneﬁcial sources . 6 . 4 CONCLUDING REMARKS 127 This assumption is consistent with the fact that they expect future search en - gines to better manage the search process and give results uniquely dedicated to a design project ( so they can use it again for other projects ) ; this is the feature of CDIRS that they appreciated most . From this evaluation , the concept of ”context” , the search personalization , search processes , results compartmentalization , context building and manipulat - ing are all acceptable and work both in academia and industry . However , the proposed CDIRS system itself needs to be improved in terms of its usability ( user interface and complexity presentation ) , which is acceptable , because for the time being it has been developed only for the purpose of the proof - of - concept . 6 . 4 Concluding Remarks In this chapter , two design cases have been used to illustrate the CDIRS life - cycle . Although it is not detailed step - by - step from the user logon into the system , this example gives the illustration of how a context can be built step - by - step . The second example has been used to show how contexts can be used and manipulated . The two cases have also been used to evaluate a demonstration . The strategy and method of evaluation have been described and the results have been presented in this chapter . The discussion of these evaluation results draws the conclusion at the end . Chapter 7 Conclusions and Future Work Under normal conditions , the research scientist is not an innovator but a solver of puzzles , and the puzzles upon which he concentrates are just those which he believes can be both statedand solved within the existing scientiﬁc tradition . - Thomas Kuhn 7 . 1 Introduction This chapter discusses the general conclusions and the limitations of this research work . Based on the achievements of the research work , some future research directions are recommended in this chapter . 7 . 2 Conclusion This thesis has deﬁne major problems of utilizing data , information and knowledge in design process . Further , it also has deﬁned the incompatibility of current search engines and the absence of a system that can fully support the information search process for designers in the early phases of a design process , as instances of the problems mentioned above as outlined in chapter 1 . The concept of context has been explored and proved that context plays a role in supporting designers’ information searches especially in the early phases of design and is structured in designers’ minds in the form of : 129 130 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 7 . 2 • Connecting and grouping designers’ search terms , while allowing designers to jump from one problem to another , one solution to another , and one focus to another , which are reﬂected by the iterative information search processes • Connecting memories of delayed judgements of relevance and going back when designers need to revisit , revise or modify search terms • Giving a starting point for unﬁnished information searches • Connecting other information and knowledge from other sources for useful design processes within the search process . Because it is structured within designers’ minds , knowledge about context is not easy to record or utilize , either by the owner or by other designers . This re - search work deﬁnes and proposes a system , called Contextual Design Information Retrieval System ( CDIRS ) , that implements the utilization of context in order to increase the beneﬁts of search engines in the earlier phases of design as well as making the contexts in design information searches explicitly visible , recordable , and transferable . 7 . 2 . 1 History : short - term memories There are two possible reasons why designers resupply or revise search terms during the iterative information search process . First of all , the information need is not yet mature and designers need to complete a trial - and - error process . Based on his or her initial knowledge , as founded from the empirical study described in chapter 3 , designers supply a number of search terms and then revise them while the design concept and understanding of such concept evolves ; therefore , the information need also evolves . The second reason is that it is possible for designers to delay judgement on search results , as one of the characteristics of an early phase , and come back to the judgement process or revise the results of a judgement process after receiving more information or knowledge for a certain context . The two possibilities listed above are supported by the ”history” features in CDIRS . Each and every search term is recorded , and therefore , during the infor - mation search process using the search engines , the designers can always revisit the previously supplied terms or supply a new or revised search term . Otherwise , the supplied search terms could get lost in the designer’s mind , or be overlooked when the designer needs to review them or their judgement of the search results . One feature of CDIRS is similar to the automatic bookmarking and history of some search engines . However , it is diﬀerent in scope and purpose . The automatic bookmarking and history features of some search engines are designed to work in bulk , where each search term is recorded in long - term storage for the history of the use of the search engine by the user . In contrast , the history in CDIRS is designed for an information search process ( that could be done by designers more 7 . 2 CONCLUSION 131 than once ) of a certain design project to support the above - mentioned purposes . It is ﬂushed away when the designer leaves the information search process or the design project . Together with bookmarking features , which will be described in the next subsection , they assist the designers in keeping search terms in context with an iterative of isolated information search processes . 7 . 2 . 2 Bookmarking : Long - term memories and design process capturing The current bookmarking systems , found at the internet web browser level and not on search engines , have limitations . At the internet web browser level , the bookmarking system ends up with disconnected search results and search pro - cesses . First , they are technically situated in diﬀerent places . Second , the search results are recorded but not the search terms . This means that after some time , the designers could forget of the search terms , and therefore , could loose the clue from where the bookmarked results came . This makes it impossible to check other search results that might have not yet been judged , or results that need to be revisited after the designer gains more understanding . By not recording the search terms , the system might be unable to advise or give a context to designers of where the starting point was of unﬁnished search processes . As already mentioned above , the automatic bookmarking system in some search engines gives no ability for the designers to have their own judgment . The bookmarking system automatically records the clicked search results whether they are relevant to the designer or not . In contrast , the CDIRS bookmarking system will only record the judged search terms and the URLs of relevant search results , and meanwhile will allow designers to see all listed search results . As the search terms are products of the designer’s thinking , these recorded search terms reﬂect the designer’s thinking evolution to solve the design problems . 7 . 2 . 3 File inclusion : Building low - level context CDIRS allows designers to make explicit connections between multiple informa - tion sources and types , as mentioned in [ Wiegeraad , 1999 ] . For the purpose of this research , CDIRS allows designers to include other types of electronic ﬁles , including images , oﬃce ﬁles , and media ﬁles . By connecting this information to recorded search terms , its search results , and its list of URLs of relevant search results , CDIRS makes this type of context , namely , knowing the contextual con - nections , explicitly visible . 7 . 2 . 4 Context Editor : Building and modifying contexts Contexts can be characterized by their same focus , topics , and relevance , as con - cluded in the literature review of this thesis . With these characteristics , the existing contexts can be recognized in design process , as described in chapter 3 . CDIRS allows designers to group search terms ( including the URLs of relevant 132 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 7 . 2 search results and connected electronic ﬁles ) into a particular focus , topic , prob - lem solver , etc . , and store them in a database . By doing so , CDIRS also allows designers to modify certain contexts if necessary . 7 . 2 . 5 Context Visualization : Making explicit context visible Context editors make the implicit context in a designer’s mind explicit and thus suitable to be stored or modiﬁed . The beneﬁts of context will increase if these explicit connections are visible to the owner or others . By making the context visible , it will be possible for designers to review the connections and connected search terms , relevant search results , and ﬁles , which means reviewing developed design concepts or problem solvers . This visualization also makes the designer’s context transparent to others . This visualization , although explicit , still allows room for interpretation . 7 . 2 . 6 Copy Context : Making sharable contexts transferable In a design team or in collaborative design projects , designers communicate with each other . During this communication , parties may share contexts . However , they might also want to share their information on that context . CDIRS allows designers to transfer sharable contexts to others . 7 . 2 . 7 Search Personalization and Compartmentalization In order to implement all of the above - mentioned features in CDIRS , the search process needs to be personalized and structured into design project compartments . In daily practices , designers search for information on the internet , print it out and put it and all other necessary information , such as sketches , notes and contacts , into a design project folder . CDIRS allows designers to manage all contextual information in one system . 7 . 2 . 8 Implementable Contexts The empirical study as described in chapter 3 concludes that two types of context exists in a design process . The contexts in CDIRS include the type that can be implemented into a computer system in order to support designers’ information search processes in the earlier phases of design . 7 . 2 . 9 CDIRS as Knowledge Elicitation and a Transfer Mean The greatest obstacle for knowledge elicitation is its gathering from diﬀerent sources and types and to put it in the context of design problem - solving . Because CDIRS is capable of storing and retrieving contextual information for a certain 7 . 3 FUTURE WORK 133 design focus or topic , it can act as a model for general knowledge elicitation for other applications . Because CDIRS is capable of storing , retrieving and visualizing contextual information , it opens up opportunities for novice designers to learn from expe - rienced designers . It also reduces the risk of “brain drain” , because designers’ thinking products and processes can be captured . 7 . 3 Future Work 7 . 3 . 1 Limitation of the Project As it was not the intention of this project to create a new search engine , some diﬃculty occurred in the operation of CDIRS that ran over existing search engines . At this time , the system cannot do a search within a deﬁned context , as is possible with some search engines that provide a search history . During the internal evaluation of the system , it was also found that the book - marking system failed to recognize advertisement pages and some web pages that have dynamic page names . The feedback from the experts in the evaluation suggested reducing the com - plexity of CDIRS . Although some experts found the context visualization useful , others suggested simplifying the visualization . CDIRS also has limitations in accepting three types of designers’ electronic ﬁles , namely , static images , oﬃce ﬁles , and dynamic or media ﬁles . As they are successfully implemented , it might helpful in the future to accept a kind of computer - aided design system ﬁle . CDIRS is implemented as a stand - alone system and only runs under a Win - dows operating system . This project can possibly be scaled up to a client - server system , a fully web - based system or other operating systems to widen its supports for designers of ( global collaborative ) design projects . Because of limited time and resources , CDIRS was not fully tested in terms of its usability . 7 . 3 . 2 Recommendations The proposed system , CDIRS , is radically changing the user - interface concept of search engines , from a single isolated query to contextual multiple queries and user - expert dialogue - like interfaces . However , this approach still needs many im - provements and evaluations in the future , especially by search engine companies . Some possible future directions of this research can be formulated and include the following : • It is still in attention and concern of many researchers to answer why certain designers could chose an appropriate design methodology and others could not . Likewise , the question emerges why certain designers ( especially the 134 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 7 . 3 experience ones ) can have eﬃcient information search and others not . An eﬀective to investigate this , is to use CDIRS to observe the way of experience and novice designers . • In the information search process , creativity from the part of the user is involved . The usage of CDIRS may supply information about creativity in information search • It has been widely noticed that there is a discourse for using artiﬁcial in - telligent or intelligence agents to artiﬁce or augment the process of judging relevance . By observing how CDIRS is used to make those judgments , op - portunities to reformulate the process are opened . Therefore other domains , such as artiﬁcial intelligent ( AI ) and psychology possible to beneﬁt from this implemented system . • There are many structured knowledge portals and other design tools avail - able ; it would be interesting to have a single integrated design support environment , where designers can draw and sketch while doing information searches . • At the cutting edge of internet technology is a portal where people can share pictures , videos , ﬁles , and chat , such as Friendster © and MySpace © . Here , there is a chance to scale CDIRS as a designers’ community portal , where designers can safely share their ideas , ﬁles , and knowledge globally . Bibliography Ahmed , S . ( 2005 ) .

Summary Large amounts of data , information , and knowledge are used during a design pro - cess , especially during the earlier stages of design . However , past research proves that designers often neglect information and instead rely on discussions with col - leagues , although the data , information and knowledge abundantly surround the designers . Besides varying in size , the diﬀerences in type and coming from diﬀerent do - mains , the diﬃculties in utilizing these resources are largely due to the absence of ”context” , namely how to bring the right data , information , and knowledge into a design context for a particular design process . In the era of the internet , where the number of websites is still growing , the opportunities for designers to re - trieve design information from the internet are increasing . However , most internet search engines are not compatible with designers’ information search processes , especially during the earlier phases of design ( analysis and conceptual design ) . These internet search engines are typically intended to be used once during an in - formation search process , while designers search for design information iteratively in a divergent or convergent search process . Moreover , there are two reasons why these search engines are not really ﬁt to the design process in the early phases . First of all , these search engines assume the information need that is reﬂected in every search term of an information query , is mature , while in the early phases of design , the concepts are vague and the problems are ill - deﬁned . Therefore , the information needs themselves are subject to be found . Second , because queries are not connected , the use of the available search engines at this moment does not give designers the opportunity to treat and utilize the contexts that have been built during the search process . Instead , those contexts are implicit and stored mentally . This research work was aimed at developing a search system that is ”natural” to the designer in the earlier phases of the design process , but more than that , captures the designer’s thinking evolution . By assuming that every search term 145 146 is a product of a designer’s thinking process , the prospect of recording judged search terms will open up possibilities of capturing a designer’s thinking path in each design project as groups of contexts . Furthermore , at this moment , the ef - fort towards knowledge utilization in design practice is generally feeble , including research attempts to answer three major questions , namely , how to gather knowl - edge , how to store and represent knowledge , and how to manage it . It is possible that the risk of brain drain that often happens when a designer leaves a company can be reduced if knowledge about information searches , both the process and the results , can be stored . In order to simultaneously complete an initial literature survey on a few anchor papers , this research work began by studying the empirical data of a previous conceptual design tool research , where the communication between designers and experts were recorded . In the present study , it can be concluded that designers are actually building up knowledge in order to handle the information search process , namely knowledge about the context of each query and the incoming information from experts . This empirical study also found that each designer has his or her own information searching path which is dependent on his or her tacit knowledge . Also from this present study , formalisms of design processes and context knowledge were proposed . Meanwhile , in an intensive and comprehensive literature study , a reconstruc - tion of the meaning of ”context” , and its concept from various domains and applications , was done . This literature study was started by ﬁnding the root of the term context and then collecting common meanings of context from some popular and widely used dictionaries . Although there was no consensus found on the deﬁnition of context , where the meaning of context was at times even opposite in some domains , this literature study revealed the emergence of the meaning of context that can be understood by readers from diﬀerent domains or applications . In order to reconstruct this meaning of context , diﬀerent approaches were used . The literature study also crystalized the characteristics of context – how it can be recognized , how researchers from many disciplines treat and handle it , and other context - related words , such as focus , relevance , topics , and judgement . As a re - sult from this literature study , the deﬁnitions of context for the purpose of this research were proposed , and the research problem statement was revisited . Based on this study and further literature studies , a system for supporting designers in retrieving design information from the internet was conceptualized . In this stage , the term “context” was technically deﬁned as a relationship between search terms that are meaningful to the designers . In system conceptualization , the use of search engines by designers is analogous to the designer - expert questions and answers . This system conceptualization used the Gane - Sarson’s data ﬂow diagram notation and entity relationship diagram to express the functions and the information design and to specify its architecture . Guided by the results of system conceptualization , a system called a web - based Contextual Design Information Retrieval System ( CDIRS ) was developed and implemented . It interfaces designers and search engines in order to increase SUMMARY 147 the beneﬁts of search engines in the earlier phases of design , as well as making the contexts in design information searches explicitly visible , recordable , and trans - ferable . This system was also designed to comply with the nature of a designers’ way of searching for design information . After conducting internal testing , the system was used by a number of invited users to simulate how information searching was done in the early phase of a design project . By observing these users , two cases involving context - building and context - use were made using CDIRS . An evaluation panel , consisting of experts with academic and industrial ex - perience backgrounds , was formed . The assumption was made that academic experts would be theoretically stronger , while industrial experts would be more familiar with novel and practicing design issues . It was decided to demonstrate CDIRS , rather than asking the panel members to operate the system . In this way , an overview of the system’s capabilities and the context theory behind it , could be obtained . The two design cases were demonstrated to the panel , to show the building and the use of context while applying CDIRS . Although the demonstration was designed to allow experts to give their opinions on CDRIS , per request , the experts experienced the system hands - on side - by - side with the researcher . Finally , the experts wanted to operate CDIRS for real and actual de - sign problems before giving their opinions by ﬁlling out the questionnaire . From this evaluation it was concluded that , with some minor suggestions , the proposed ”context” concept implemented in CDIRS was well accepted and proven to work in design assignments . Samenvatting 3 Tijdens een ontwerpproces worden grote hoeveelheden gegevens , informatie en kennis gebruikt , vooral in de vroegere fasen van het ontwerpen . Uit eerder gedaan onderzoek blijkt echter dat ontwerpers vaak informatie negeren en in plaats daar - van terugvallen op discussies met collega’s , ondanks de overvloed aan gegevens , informatie en kennis die hen omringt . Behalve de variatie in omvang , de verschillen in type en domein van herkomst , komen de moeilijkheden bij het gebruik van de informatiebronnen vooral door het ontbreken van ”context” ; hoe moeten de juiste gegevens , informatie en kennis in een ontwerpcontext gebracht worden voor een bepaald ontwerpproces . In het internettijdperk , bij een nog steeds groeiend aantal webpagina’s , nemen de mo - gelijkheden voor ontwerpers toe om via internet informatie te krijgen . Maar de meeste internet - zoekmachines zijn niet afgestemd op zoekprocessen van ontwer - pers , vooral tijdens de vroegere fasen van het ontwerpen ( analyse en conceptueel ontwerpen ) . Deze internet - zoekmachines zijn typisch bedoeld voor incidenteel gebruik , terwijl ontwerpers juist informatie zoeken op een iteratieve manier , di - vergerend of convergerend . Allereerst gaan deze zoekmachines ervan uit dat de informatiebehoefte , uitgedrukt in een zoekterm , zelf al rijp is , terwijl in de vroege fasen van het ontwerpen de concepten vaag en de problemen nog niet goed zijn gedeﬁnieerd . De informatiebehoeften zelf moeten dus nog gevonden worden . Ten tweede , omdat de zoekopdrachten niet gekoppeld zijn bieden de huidige zoek - machines geen mogelijkheden aan de ontwerpers om contexten die tijdens het zoekproces zijn opgebouwd verder te gebruiken . In plaats daarvan worden con - texten impliciet en mentaal opgeslagen . Het onderzoek richtte zich op het ontwikkelen van een voor de ontwerper ”natuurlijk”zoeksysteem voor de vroege ontwerpfasen , maar dat ook het denkpro - ces van de ontwerper volgt Aannemende dat iedere zoekterm een product is van de gedachten van de ontwerper , geeft het registreren van ingegeven zoektermen 3 Summary in Dutch 149 150 de mogelijkheid om de gedachtegang van een ontwerper vast te leggen in de vorm van groepen contexten . Verder is er in het algemeen nog weinig onderzoek gedaan naar het gebruik van kennis in de ontwerppraktijk , met als belangrijkste drie vra - gen hoe kennis te vergaren , hoe het op te slaan en te representeren en hoe het te beheren . Mogelijk kan het gevaar van brain drain , wanneer een ontwerper een bedrijf verlaat , worden gereduceerd als kennis over het informatie - zoeken , zowel het proces als de uitkomsten , kunnen worden vastgelegd . Tegelijk met een eerste literatuurstudie , begon het onderzoek met een studie naar empirische gegevens uit een eerder onderzoeksproject naar conceptuele on - twerptools , waar de communicatie tussen ontwerpers en experts waren gereg - istreerd . Uit deze studie kan worden geconcludeerd dat ontwerpers in feite kennis opbouwen om het informatiezoekproces te kunnen uitvoeren , namelijk kennis over de context van iedere zoekopdracht en de binnenkomende informatie van de ex - perts . Deze empirische studie gaf ook aan dat iedere ontwerper zijn of haar eigen informatiezoekpad heeft afhankelijk van zijn of haar voorkennis . Van deze studie werden tevens formalismen van ontwerpprocessen en contextkennis voorgesteld . Intussen werd een intensieve en uitgebreide literatuurstudie uitgevoerd , waar - mee het begrip en het concept ”context”werd gereconstrueerd gezien vanuit ver - schillende domeinen en toepassingen . Deze literatuurstudie ging uit van het ba - sisbegrip ”context”en vervolgens werden betekenissen van context uit populaire en veelgebruikte woordenboeken verzameld . Hoewel er geen consensus is gevon - den in de deﬁnitie van context , waarbij de betekenis van context uit sommige domeinen soms zelfs tegengesteld was , kwam toch een betekenis van context naar boven die door lezers uit verschillende domeinen en toepassingen begrepen wordt . Om deze betekenis te herleiden werden verschillende benaderingen gebruikt . De literatuurstudie kristalliseerde de karakteristieken van context uit , hoe het wordt herkend , hoe onderzoekers uit verschillende disciplines het hanteren , evenzo voor contextgerelateerde termen als focus , relevantie , onderwerp en beoordeling . Met de resultaten uit de literatuurstudie konden de deﬁnities van context ten be - hoeve van dit onderzoek worden voorgesteld , and werd de onderzoeksvraagstelling herzien . Gebaseerd op deze en verdere literatuurstudies werd een systeem geconcip - ieerd voor het ondersteunen van ontwerpers bij het verkrijgen van informatie via internet . In dit stadium werd context technisch gedeﬁnieerd als een relatie tussen zoektermen die betekenisvol zijn voor ontwerpers . Bij het concipi¨eren van het sys - teem was er een analogie tussen het gebruik van zoekmachines door ontwerpers en de vragen en antwoorden tussen ontwerpers en experts . Bij deze systeemconcep - tualisatie werden de Gane - Sarson datastroomdiagramnotatie en entiteit - relatie - diagrammen gebruikt om het functie - en informatieontwerp uit te drukken en om de architectuur te speciﬁceren . Vanuit het systeemconcept werd een systeem , webgebaseerd Contextual De - sign Information Retrieval System ( CDIRS ) , ontwikkeld en gemplementeerd . het vormt een interface tussen ontwerpers en zoekmachines om de voordelen van zoek - machines in de vroege fasen van het ontwerpen te verbeteren , en om contexten SAMENVATTING 3 151 van het informatie zoeken expliciet zichtbaar te maken , en te kunnen vastleggen en doorgeven . Het systeem is ook aangepast aan de manier waarop ontwerpers zoeken naar ontwerpinformatie . Na interne tests werd het systeem door een aantal uitgenodigde personen ge - bruikt om te simuleren hoe het zoeken naar informatie verloopt in de vroege fasen van een ontwerpproject . Door deze gebruikers van CDIRS te observeren werden twee cases ontwikkeld , van het opbouwen van context en van het gebruik van context . Er werd een panel gevormd bestaande uit experts met academische en met in - dustrile achtergrond . De aanname hierbij was dat academische experts theoretisch sterker zouden zijn en experts uit de industrie meer vertrouwd met nieuwe en praktische ontwerpproblemen . Er werd besloten om CDIRS te demonstreren en de panelleden niet te vragen het systeem te bedienen . Op deze wijze kon een overzicht worden verkregen van de mogelijkheden van het systeem en de achterliggende contexttheorie . Beide ontwerpcases werden aan het panel gedemonstreerd om het bouwen en het gebruik van context te tonen . Hoewel de demonstratie was opgezet om de experts gericht te vragen naar hun opinie over CDIRS , was er meer sprake van een hands - on ervaring samen met de onderzoeker . Tenslotte wilden de ex - perts het systeem daadwerkelijk gebruiken voor echte , actuele ontwerpproblemen alvorens hun opinie te geven d . m . v . het vragenformulier . Uit de evaluatie kwam naar voren dat het voorgestelde concept van context , zoals gemplementeerd in CDIRS , goed ontvangen werd en bleek te werken in ontwerpopdrachten . Inhaltsangabe 4 W¨ahrend eines Entwurfsprozesses werden große Mengen von Daten , Informatio - nen und Wissen gebraucht , vor allem in den fr¨uheren Phasen eines Entwurfs . Fr¨uhere Untersuchungen beweisen jedoch , daß Designer oft Informationen igno - rieren und sich stattdessen auf Diskussionen mit Kollegen verlassen . Sie tun dies trotz des ¨Uberﬂusses von Daten , Informationen und Wissen , der sie umringt . Außer der Variation in Umfang , dem Unterschied in Typ und der Herkunfts - dom¨ane , liegen die Schwierigkeiten beim Gebrauch von Informationsquellen vor allem am Fehlen von Zusammenh¨angen . Die Frage ist , wie die richtigen Daten , Informationen und das richtige Wissen mit einer bestimmten Entwurfsaufgabe in Zusammenhang gebracht werden k¨onnen . Im Internetzeitalter , bei der noch immer wachsenden Anzahl von Webseiten , nehmen die M¨oglichkeiten f¨ur Desi - gner zu um ¨uber das Internet Informationen zu bekommen . Die meisten Inter - netsuchmaschinen sind jedoch nicht abgestimmt auf Suchprozesse von Designern , vor allem w¨ahrend in den fr¨uhen Entwurfsphasen ( Analyse und Konzept ) . Inter - netsuchmaschinen sind auf einmaligen Gebrauch abgestimmt . Designer hingegen suchen wiederholt Informationen , mal ausweitend , und ein andermal zielgerich - tet . Es gibt zwei Hauptgr¨unde , warum Suchmaschinen nicht wirklich zur fr¨uhen Entwurfsphase passen . Zum Ersten gehen diese Suchmaschinen davon aus , dass der Informationsbedarf , ausgedr¨uckt in einem Suchbegriﬀ , selbst schon ausgereift ist . Hingegen sind in den fr¨uhen Entwurfsphasen die Konzepte vage und die Pro - bleme noch nicht gut deﬁniert . Die Informationsbed¨urfnisse selbst m¨ussen noch gefunden werden . Zum Zweiten sind Suchauftr¨age bei heutigen Suchmaschinen nicht aneinander gekoppelt . Damit bieten sie keine M¨oglichkeit f¨ur Designer um Zusammenh¨ange , die w¨ahrend des Suchprozesses aufgebaut werden , weiter zu be - nutzen . Stattdessen bleiben solche Zusammenh¨ange f¨ur Designer implizit , und sie werden nur im Ged¨achtnis bewahrt . Die Untersuchung richtet sich auf die Entwicklung eines Suchsystems , das der 4 Summary in German 153 154 fr¨uhen Entwurfsphase auf ’nat¨urliche’ Weise entspricht und dar¨uber hinaus in Be - tracht zieht , wie Designer Ideen entwickeln . Das System nimmt an , daß jeder Such - begriﬀ ein Produkt des Denkprozesses eines Designers ist . Die M¨oglichkeit , bewer - tete Suchbegriﬀe mit einer Bewertung zu speichern , er¨oﬀnet wieder M¨oglichkeiten um den Gedankengang eines Designers per Designprojekt als Gruppen von Zusam - menh¨angen darzustellen . Desweiteren gibt es noch wenig Untersuchungen ¨uber den Gebrauch von Wissen in der Designpraxis , insbesondere zu drei wichtigen Fragen : wie Wissen sammeln , wie es speichern und pr¨asentieren und wie es ver - walten ? Hier Es gibt die Gefahr eines ’brain drain’ , wenn ein Designer einen Be - trieb verl¨asst . M¨oglicherweise kann diese Gefahr reduziert werden , wenn Wissen ¨uber Informationssuchen , sowohl ¨uber den Prozess als auch ¨uber die Ergebnisse , festgelegt werden k¨onnen . Diese Untersuchung begonn mit einer ersten Literaturstudie und gleichzeitig mit einer Analyse von empirischen Daten aus einem frherem Untersuchungspro - jekt nach konzeptuellen Designwerkzeugen , in dem die Kommunikation zwischen Designer und Experten registriert wurden . Aus der Analyse kann geschlossen wer - den , daß Designer tats¨achlich Wissen aufbauen um den Informationssuchprozess ausf¨uhren zu k¨onnen , n¨amlich Wissen ¨uber die Zusammenh¨ange von jedem Such - auftrag und ¨uber die dazukommenden Informationen von Experten . Diese em - pirische Studie ergab auch , dass jeder Designer seinen oder ihren eigenen Infor - mationspfad hat , abh¨angig von seinem oder ihrem Vorwissen . Als Ergebnis der Studie werden formelle Elemente fr Designprozesse und Wissenszusammenh¨ange vorgestellt . Zugleich wurde eine intensive und ausf¨uhrliche Literaturstudie ausgef¨uhrt , in der der Begriﬀ und das Konzept ’Kontext’ aus der Sicht verschiedener Gebie - te und Anwendungen konstruiert wird . Diese Literaturstudie ging aus von dem Basisbegriﬀ ’Kontext’ . Zun¨achst wurde die Grundbedeutung des Begriﬀs festge - stellt . Dann wurden Bedeutungen von Kontext aus popul¨aren und viel gebrauch - ten W¨orterb¨uchern gesammelt . Obwohl kein Konsens in der Deﬁnition von Kon - text gefunden wurde , und die Bedeutung von Kontext manchmal widerspr¨uchlich wiedergegeben wurde , konnte mithilfe der Literaturstudie doch eine Bedeutung des Begriﬀes Kontext festgestellt werden , die f¨ur Leser aus verschiedenen Be - reichen und Anwendungen verst¨andlich ist . Um diese Bedeutung zur¨uckzuf¨uren , wurden verschiedene Ann¨aherungen gew¨ahlt . Die Literaturstudie kristallisierte den charakteristische Elemente von Kontext heraus : wie er erkannt wird , wie Un - tersucher aus verschiedenen Disziplinen ihn handhaben . Dies wurde auch getan f¨ur kontextverwandte Begriﬀe wie Fokus , Relevanz , Thema und Beurteilung . Mit den Ergebnissen aus der Literaturstudie wurde eine Deﬁnition von Kontext f¨ur die Zwecke dieser Untersuchung vorgestellt , und die urspr¨unglich gestellte Unter - suchungsfrage neu formuliert . Basierend auf dieser und weiterer Literaturstudien wurde ein System konzi - piert , das Designer bei der Informationssuche im Internet unterst¨utzen soll . In diesem Stadium wird Kontext technisch deﬁniert als eine Beziehung zwischen Suchbegriﬀen die f¨ur Designer bedeutungsvoll sind . Beim Konzipieren des Sys - INHALTSANGABE 4 155 tems wird eine Analogie geschaﬀen zwischen dem Gebrauch von Suchmaschinen durch Designer , und den Fragen und Antworten zwischen Designern und Exper - ten . Bei der Systemkonzeption wurden Gane - Sarson Datenstromdiagrammrech - nungen und Wesen - Beziehungsdiagramme angewendet , um die Funktions - und Informationsform auszudr¨ucken und um die Systemarchitektur zu speziﬁeren . Auf der Basis der Ergebnisse der Systemkonzeption wurde ein System ent - wickelt und implementiert : das web - based Contextuel Design Information Retrie - val System ( CDIRS ) . Es ist ein Interface zwischen Designer und Suchmaschi - ne , das die Vorteile von Suchmaschinen f¨ur die fr¨uhen Entwurfsphasen Phasen noch vergr¨oßert , und dar¨uberhinaus Zusammenh¨ange bei Designinformationssu - chen deutlich sichtbar , speicherbar und transferierbar macht . Das System wurde so gestaltet , daß es der Herangehensweise von Designern bei der Suche nach Ent - wurfsinformation entspricht . Nach ersten internen Tests wurde das System durch eine Anzahl eingeladener Personen benutzt , um zu simulieren , wie das Suchen nach Informationen in den fr¨uhen Phasen eines Entwurfsprojektes verl¨auft . Die Beobachtung dieser Benutzer resultierte in zwei F¨allen von CDIRS - Benutzung : dem Aufbauen eines Kontextes , und dem Gebrauch eines Kontextes . Ein Expertenpanel mit akademischen und mit industriellen Hintergrund wur - de geformt . Die Annahme hierbei war , daß akademische Experten theoretisch st¨arker und Experten aus der Industrie vertrauter mit neuen und praktischen Entwurfsproblemen sein w¨urden . Es wurde beschlossen , CDIRS zu demonstrie - ren und die Panelmitglieder nicht zu fragen , das System zu bedienen . Auf diese Weise kann eine ¨Ubersicht erlangt werden von den M¨oglichkeiten des Systems und der dahinterliegenden Kontexttheorie . Beide Entwurfsf¨allen wurden dem Pa - nel demonstriert , um das Aufbauen und den Gebrauch von Zusammenh¨angen zu zeigen . Obwohl die Demonstration geplant war , um die Experten gezielt nach ihrer Meinung ¨uber CDIRS zu fragen , wurde daraus mehr eine ’hands - on’ Er - probung zusammen mit den Untersuchern . Schließlich wollen die Experten das System tats¨achlich benutzen f¨ur echte Entwurfsprobleme , bevor sie ihre Meinung abgaben beim Ausf¨ullen eines Fragebogens . Das Ergebnis dieser Evaluation war , daß das vorgestellte Konzept von Kontext in CDIRS gut angenommen wurde , und daß das System , mit Ausnahme von einigen Details , bei der Entwurfsarbeit brauchbar ist .

Sen lis¨aksi , ett¨a niden k¨aytett¨avien tietovarastojen koko , tyyppi ja alkuper¨a vaihtelevat , niiden k¨ayt¨on vaikeus johtuu puutteellisesta sidoksesta asiayhteyteen ( konteksti ) , eli siit¨a , miten tuoda oikea tieto ja tiet¨amys tiettyyn suunnittelu - tilanteeseen . Internetin aikakaudella , kun www - sivustojen m¨a¨ar¨a on jatkuvasti kasvussa , suunnittelijan mahdollisuus hy¨odynt¨a¨a internetist¨a saatavissa olevaa tietoa kasvaa . Useimmat internet - hakukoneet eiv¨at kuitenkaan ole yhteensopivia suunnittelijan tiedonhakuprosessin kanssa , varsinkin kun on kyse suunnittelun al - kuvaiheista ( ongelma - analyysi ja k¨asitteellinen suunnittelu ) . Internet - hakukoneet ovat tyypillisesti tarkoitettu k ¨ aytett ¨ av ¨ aksi tiedon kertaluonteiseen hakemiseen , kun taas suunnittelijan hakuprosessi on toistuvaa , suunnitteluun liittyv¨an , kon - vergoituvan tai divergoituvan tiedon etsint¨a¨a . Lis¨aksi on olemassa kaksi syyt¨a , miksi internet - hakukoneet eiv¨at kovin hyvin sovellu alkuvaiheen suunnittelupro - sessiin . Ensinn¨akin , hakukoneet olettavat , ett¨a hakutermin m¨a¨aritt¨am¨a tiedon tar - ve on tarkkaan harkittu , kun todellisuudessa suunnittelun alkuvaiheissa k¨asitteet ovat ep¨am¨a¨ar¨aisi¨a ja ongelmat ep¨aselvi¨a . T¨ast¨a syyst¨a tiedon tarve itsess¨a¨an on haun kohteena . Toiseksi , olemassa olevien hakukoneiden k¨aytt¨o ei t¨all¨a hetkell¨a anna suunnittelijalle tilaisuutta k¨asitell¨a ja hy¨odynt¨a¨a sis¨alt¨o¨a , joka on raken - nettu hakuprosessin aikana , koska haut eiv¨at ole yhteydess¨a toisiinsa . Sen sijaan sis¨all¨ot ovat implisiittisi¨a ja varastoitu jokaisen suunnittelijan omaan muistiin . T¨am¨an tutkimusty¨on tarkoituksena oli kehitt¨a¨a hakuj¨arjestelm¨a , joka on ”luon - nollinen”suunnitteluprosessin alkuvaiheen suunnittelijoille ja joka tallettaa muis - tiinsa suunnittelijan ajatusmallin kehittymist¨a suunnitteluty¨on edetess¨a . Oletus , ett¨a jokainen hakutermi on tuotos suunnittelijan ajatteluprosessista , antaa mah - 5 Summary in Finnish 157 158 dollisuuden tallentaa arvioituja hakutermej¨a ja tulkita suunnittelijan ajattelupol - kua suunnitteluprojektiin liittyvien kontekstien joukkona . T¨all¨a hetkell¨a aiemman suunnittelutiet¨amyksen hy¨odynt¨aminen on k¨ayt¨ann¨oss¨a v¨ah¨aist¨a . Aiemmissa tut - kimuksissa ei ole my¨osk¨a¨an kyetty vastaamaan kolmeen keskeiseen p¨a¨akysymykseen : kuinka tiet¨amyst¨a voidaan ker¨at¨a , miten sit¨a voidaan tallentaa ja kuinka sit¨a voi - daan k¨asitell¨a . Usein , kun ty¨ontekij¨a j¨att¨a¨a ty¨opaikkansa , mukana h¨avi¨a¨a my¨os h ¨ anen tieto - taitonsa . T ¨ am ¨ an vaikutusta on mahdollista lievent ¨ a ¨ a , jos tiet ¨ amys informaatiohauista , niin prosesseista kuin tuloksista , voidaan varastoida . T¨am¨a tutkimusty¨o aloitettiin alustavalla tutustumisella kirjalliseen l¨ahdeai - neistoon sek¨a hakemalla kokemustietoa suunnitteluty¨okaluista , joissa kommuni - kointi suunnittelijoiden ja asiantuntijoiden kanssa tallennettiin . T¨ast¨a selvitys - ty¨ost¨a voitiin tehd¨a johtop¨a¨at¨os , ett¨a suunnittelijat todellisuudessa muodosta - vat tiet¨amyst¨a selviyty¨akseen tiedonhakuprosessista ; kyse on tehtyjen kyselyjen kontekstista ja asiantuntijoilta saadusta tiedosta . T¨am¨an empiirisen tutkimuksen tuloksena todettiin , ett¨a jokaisella suunnittelijalla on oma tiedonhakupolkunsa , joka on riippuvainen hnen omasta hiljaisesta tiedostaan . Tutkimuksessa laadit - tiin my¨os suunnitteluprosessia ja siin¨a k¨aytett¨av¨a¨a kontekstitiet¨amyst¨a koskeva formalismi . Syv¨allisen ja kokonaisvaltaisen kirjallisuustutkimuksen perusteella m¨a¨ariteltiin kontekstin k¨asite eri soveltamisen aloilla ja sovelluksissa . T¨am¨a kirjallisuusselvi - tys aloitettiin selvitt¨am¨all¨a konteksti - termin alkujuuret ja sen j¨alkeen ker¨a¨am¨all¨a t¨am¨an k¨asitteen yleisi¨a merkityksi¨a muutamasta laajalti k¨aytetyst¨a sanakirjasta . Vaikka yksik¨asitteist¨a merkityst¨a termille ”konteksti”ei l¨oydetty ja vaikka joissa - kin l¨ahteiss¨a oli k¨asitteelle olemassa samaan aikaan jopa aivan vastakkaisia merki - tyksi¨a , t¨am¨a kirjallisuusselvitys paljasti konteksti - termin k¨aytt¨otavan eri l¨ahteiss¨a ja sovelluksissa . Jotta konteksti - termin t¨asm¨allinen m¨a¨aritteleminen oli mahdol - lista , oli k¨aytett¨av¨a erilaisia l¨ahestymistapoja . Kirjallisuusselvitys my¨os kiteytti konteksti - termin ominaisuuksia : kuinka se voidaan tunnistaa , kuinka tutkijat eri tieteenaloilla suhtautuvat siihen ja k¨aytt¨av¨at sit¨a , sek¨a muut konteksti - termin su - kulaissanat , kuten tarkentuminen ( focus ) , relevanssi , aihe ( topic ) ja arvio ( judge - ment ) . Tuloksena t¨ast¨a kirjallisuusselvityksest¨a saatiin ehdotus konteksti - termin m¨a¨arittelemiseksi t¨am¨an tutkimuksen tarkoitukseen ja tutkimusongelman tarken - tamiseen . Perustuen tehtyyn selvitysty¨oh¨on ja t¨aydent¨aviin kirjallisuusselvityksiin pys - tyttiin m¨a¨arittelem¨a¨an j¨arjestelm¨akonsepti , joka voi tukea suunnittelijaa saamaan internetist¨a informaatiota suunnitteluty¨ons¨a tueksi . T¨ass¨a vaiheessa termi ”kon - teksti”m¨a¨ariteltiin suunnittelijalle merkityksellisten hakutermien suhteena . Ta - voitteena oli kehitt¨a¨a j¨arjestelm¨a , jota suunnittelijat k¨aytt¨av¨at hakukoneena ja joka on toimintaperiaatteeltaan analoginen suunnittelija - asiantuntija kommuni - kaation kanssa . T¨am¨an j¨arjestelm¨an periaate kuvattiin toiminnallisuuden osalta Gane – Sarson : n tietovirtakaavioiden avulla ja k¨aytt¨aen ER - kaavioita kuvaamaan tiedon rakennetta ja arkkitehtuuria . M¨a¨arittelyn pohjalta suunniteltiin ja toteutettiin verkkopohjainen suunnit - teluty¨ot¨a tukeva j¨arjestelm¨a , Contextual Design Information Retrieval System YHTEENVETO 5 159 ( CDIRS ) . Se tukee suunnittelijoiden ja hakukoneiden vuorovaikutusta siten , ett¨a hakukoneita voidaan hy¨odynt¨a¨a tehokkaasti alkuvaiheen suunnittelussa , kuten my¨os tekem¨a¨an suunnitteluinformaation kontekstin selke¨asti n¨akyv¨aksi , tallen - nettavaksi ja siirrettvksi . Jrjestelm on suunniteltu noudattamaan suunnittelijalle luontevaa tapaa etsi¨a suunnitteluinformaatiota . Sis¨aisen testauksen j¨alkeen j¨arjestelm¨a¨a testattiin ulkoisten k¨aytt¨ajien kanssa . N ¨ ain saatiin selville , kuinka tiedonhakua toteutetaan todellisten suunnittelupro - jektien alkuvaiheissa . Testik¨ayt¨on tuloksena saatiin analysoitavaksi kaksi tilanne - kuvausta , jotka sis¨alsiv¨at sek¨a kontekstin rakentamisen ett¨a k¨aytt¨amisen CDIRS - j¨arjestelmn avulla . T¨am¨an j¨alkeen perustettiin arviointilautakunta , joka koostui akateemisista ja teollisuuden asiantuntijoista . Oletuksena oli , ett¨a akateemiset asiantuntijat ovat teoreettisesti vahvempia , kun taas teollisuusasiantuntijoille tutumpia oli - sivat uudenlaiset ja k¨ayt¨ann¨onl¨aheiset suunnitteluongelmat . Arviointilautakun - nan j¨aseni¨a ei pyydetty k¨aytt¨am¨a¨an j¨arjestelm¨a¨a , vaan p¨a¨adyttiin demonstroi - maan heille CDIRS : n toimintaa .

Matome 6 製品の概念設計においては、その製品に関連する適切な情報と知識が必要とされる。しかしながら、過去 の研究が示すように、多くのデザイナーが大量の情報に囲まれているにもかかわらず、それらを有効に用 いず、情報獲得の手段については、デザイナー間の対話に頼っている。設計に関する情報には、サイズ、 型やドメインによる違いがあるが、それらの情報の利用を難しくするものは「コンテクスト」の取り扱い にある。特定の設計過程において設計のコンテクストの把握は難しく、しばしばそれらは考慮されない。 インターネットが普及している時代において、情報量が増加するにつれ、デザイナーが設計に関する情報 を得る機会も増える。しかし、多くのインターネット上の検索システムは、デザイナーの情報探索プロセ スに対応できない。これらの検索システムは、一時的な情報の獲得に使用される。それに対して、デザイ ナーの情報探索プロセスは、返しを含む発散あるいは収束プロセスである。さらに、検索システムの使用 には、特定の語彙を必要とするが、初期の設計過程においては、設計のための概念があいまいであるため、 それらの取得とその利用が難しい。また、検索システムは、情報の探索過程に使用されたコンテクストを 利用することができない。 本研究の目的は、初期設計過程においてデザイナーが自然に使用可能（つまり、コンテクストを利用可能） であり、かつ、デザイナーの思考過程を考慮した検索システムを開発することである。 6 Summary in Japanese 161 162 すべての探索語彙がデザイナーの思考過程から導かれるものであると仮定すれば、本システムを用いるこ とにより、その思考過程をたどることができるようになる。このため、どのように知識を獲得、保存し表 現するかという研究課題の解決に貢献し、また設計対象と設計知識を保存することにより、知識流出のリ スクを減少させることができる。 第一に、本研究では重要と思われる文献調査を行った。同時に、既存の設計支援システムを用いた設計実 験を行った。この結果、デザイナーは、エキスパートからの対話を通して情報検索のための情報を獲得す ることが観察された。また、デザイナーは各々の知識背景に依存する情報探索ルートを持っていることが わかった。設計実験と文献調査を通して、本研究では設計過程とコンテクストに関する知識の形式方法を 提案した。 本研究ではさらに、文献調査を包括的に行い、多様なドメインから導かれるコンテクストの意味を考察し た。調査は、第一に、広義の辞書などから導かれるコンテクストの語源と意味について行われた。調査の 結果、それらの意味は一貫しておらず、しばしば対義的に定義されていた。また、このことから、コンテ クストの意味は多様なドメインやアプリケーションから創発されるものであることが明らかになった。 更なる文献調査と研究に基づき、本研究ではデザイナーのインターネット上の情報獲得支援システムの概 念設計を行った。本システムでは、コンテキストを「デザイナーにとって意味のある検索語彙の関係」と 定義した。本システムにおいて、インターネット上での情報探索は、エキスパートとの対話プロセスとし て位置づけられる。また本システムは、機能と情報設計を表現し、システムのアーキテクチュアを特定す るため、 Gane - Sarson のデータフローダイアグラムと実体間関係ダイアグラムの表記を用いている。 これらの概念設計にもとづいて、本研究では、 Conceptual Design Information Retrieval Systems ( CDIRS ）を開発および実装した。本システムは、初期設計過程で検索エンジンを用いることによる効果を 高めるために、デザイナーと検索エンジン間のインターフェースの役割を担う。また、本システムは、設 計のために検索されたコンテクストを明示的に表現、記録、転送可能にする。さらに、本システムは、デ ザイナーの設計に関する情報探索を自然な形（コンテキストを用いた形）で実現させる。 本研究では、コンテキストの獲得とその利用について、本システムの実現可能性に関する実験と評価を行 った。また、大学と企業からエキスパートを招き、本システムの実用性に関する評価を行った。ここで、 大学のエキスパートは理論について、また、企業のエキスパートは、実際の設計に関してより多くの知識 を有すると仮定した。システムの評価は、エキスパートが実際に利用するのではなく、デモンストレーシ ョンの形式によって行った。２通りの設計ケーススタディについて、本システムを用いて評価を行った。 これらの評価の結果、エキスパートは実際の設計において、本システムの導入が有効であることを示した。 これらの実験と評価により、本研究において示した概念とシステムは、設計過程において広く役立つこと を検証した。 ¨Ozet 7 Bir tasarım s¨ureci boyunca , ¨ozellikle tasarımın erken safhalarında b¨uy¨uk miktarda veri , bilgi ve birikim kullanılır . Ancak ge¸cmi¸s ara¸stırmalar tasarımcıların bol veri ve bilgiyle ¸cevrili olmalarına raˇgmen , genellikle bilgiyi ihmal edip onun yerine meslekta¸slarıyla yaptıkları tartı¸smalara dayandıklarını kanıtlar . Bu kaynakların kullanımındaki zorluklar boyuttaki deˇgi¸sim , t¨urdeki farklılıklar ve farklı alanlardan gelmi¸s olmalarının yanı sıra b¨uy¨uk ¨ol¸c¨ude baˇglamın eksikliˇgine ; yani belirli bir tasarım i¸cin doˇgru veri ve bilginin tasarım baˇglamına nasıl geti - rildiˇgine baˇglıdır . Hala web sitesi sayısının arttıˇgı internet ¸caˇgında , tasarımcılar i¸cin internetten tasarım bilgisine eri¸sme fırsatları artmaktadır . Ancak bir¸cok in - ternet arama motoru tasarımcıların , ¨ozellikle tasarımın ilk safhalarındaki ( analiz ve kavramsal tasarım ) bilgi arama s¨ure¸cleri ile uyumlu deˇgildir . Tasarımcıların tekrarlanan ıraksak ve yakınsak arama s¨ure¸cleriyle tasarım bilgisi aramalarına kar¸sın bu internet arama motorları genelde bir kez bilgi arama s ¨ ureci boyunca kullanım i¸cin ama¸clanmı¸stır . Ayrıca bu arama motorlarının erken safhalarda ta - sarım s¨urecine tam anlamıyla uymamalarının iki nedeni vardır . ˙Ilk olarak bu ara - ma motorları bilgi sorgusunda kullanılan her arama teriminin yansıttıˇgı gerekli olan bilginin olgun olduˇgunu kabul eder , ancak tasarımın erken safhalarında kav - ramlar muˇglak , problemler iyi tanımlanmamı¸stır . Bu sebeple gerekli bilginin ken - disi bulunmalıdır . ˙Ikinci olarak , sorgular birbirleriyle baˇglantılı olmadıˇgından ¸su anki mevcut arama motorlarının kullanımı tasarımcılara arama s¨ureci boyunca olu¸sturulan baˇglamların i¸slenmesine ve yararlanılmasına fırsat vermez . Bunun ye - rine bu baˇglamlar ¨ort¨ul¨ud¨ur ve zihinde saklanır . Bu ara¸stırma ¸calı¸sması tasarım s¨urecinin erken safhalarında tasarımcıya doˇgal gelen , ve bundan daha ¸cok tasarımcının d¨u¸s¨unce geli¸simini kapsayan bir ara - ma sistemi geli¸stirmeyi ama¸clamı¸stır . Her arama teriminin tasarımcının d¨u¸s¨unme s¨urecinin bir ¨ur¨un¨u olduˇgu varsayılarak yargılanmı¸s arama terimlerinin kaydedil - me ihtimali tasarımcının her tasarım projesini baˇglamlar grubu i¸cinde d¨u¸s¨unme 7 Summary in Turkish 163 164 yolunu kavrama olasılıklarını a¸cacaktır . Buna ilaveten ¸su anda tasarım pratiˇgindeki bilgi kullanım ¸cabası , ki buna bilgi nasıl toplanır , bilgi nasıl saklanır ve sunulur , ve bu nasıl kullanılır ¨u¸c ana sorusunu cevaplamaya y¨onelik ara¸stırma giri¸simleri de dahildir , genellilke zayıftır . Bir tasarımcı ¸sirketi terkettiˇginde sıklıkla ortaya ¸cıkan beyin g¨o¸c¨u riskinin azaltılması , eˇger bilgi aramasıyla ilgili bilgi , s¨ure¸c ve sonu¸clar olarak kaydedilebiliyorsa m¨umk¨und¨ur .

Bu ¸calı¸smada tasarımcıların aslında her sorgu baˇglamıyla ilgili , bi - rikim ve uzmanlardan gelen bilgi olmak ¨uzere , bilgi arama s¨ureciyle ba¸sa ¸cıkmak i¸cin birikim in¸sa ettikleri sonucuna varılabilir . Bu deneysel ¸calı¸sma ayrıca her tasarımcının kendi zımni bilgisine dayanan kendi bilgi arama yolu olduˇgunu bul - mu¸stur . Ayrıca bu ¸calı¸smayla tasarım s¨ure¸clerinin ve baˇglam bilgilerinin ilkeleri ¨onerilmi¸stir . Bu arada yoˇgun ve kapsamlı bir literat¨ur ¸calısmasıyla ’baˇglam’ın anlamının yeniden in¸sası ve ¸ce¸sitli alanlardan ve uygulamalardan kavramı yapılmı¸stır . Bu literat¨ur ¸calı¸sması baˇglam teriminin k¨ok¨u bulunarak ve bazı pop¨uler ve ¸cokca kullanılan s¨ozl¨uklerden ortak anlamlar toplanarak ba¸slatılmı¸stır . Bazı alanlar - da baˇglamın tanımı birbirinin tam kar¸sıtı olsa da ve baˇglamın tanımında bir g¨or¨u¸s birliˇgi olmasa da , bu literat¨ur ¸calı¸sması farklı alanlardan ve uygulamalar - dan okuyucuların anlayacaˇgı bir tanımın ortaya ¸cıkı¸sını g¨ostermi¸stir . Baˇglamın bu tanımını yeniden in¸sa etmek i¸cin farklı yakla¸sımlar kullanılmı¸stır . Bu literat¨ur ara¸stırması ayrıca baˇglamın niteliklerini : nasıl te¸shis edileceˇgini , farklı ¨oˇgretilerden ara¸stırmacıların bunu ve odak , ilinti , konular ve karar gibi diˇger baˇglamla ilin - tili kelimeleri nasıl i¸sleyeceˇgini ve ele alacaˇgını belirginle¸stirmi¸stir . Bu literat¨ur ara¸stırmasının sonucu olarak bu ¸calı¸smanın amacı olan baˇglamın tanımları ¨onerilmi¸s ve ara¸strıma problemi ifadesi yeniden g¨ozden ge¸cirilmi¸stir . Bu ve gelecek literat¨ur ¸calı¸smalarına dayanarak tasarımcıların internetten ta - sarım bilgisine ula¸smalarını destekleyen bir sistem kavramsalla¸stırılmı¸stır . Bu a¸samada baˇglam terimi teknik olarak , tasarımcılar i¸cin anlamlı olan arama te - rimleri arasındaki ili¸ski olarak tanımlanmı¸stır . Sistem kavramla¸stırılmasında ara - ma motorlarının tasarımcılar tarafından kullanılması tasarımcı - uzman sorularına ve cevaplarına benzerdir . Bu sistem kavramla¸stırması fonksiyonları ve bilgi ta - sarımını ifade etmek ve bunun mimarisini belirtmek i¸cin , Gane – Sarson’un veri akı¸s diyagram g¨osterimini ve varlık ili¸ski diyagramını kullanmı¸stır . Sistem kavramla¸stırması sonu¸clarının rehberliˇginde aˇg - bazlı Baˇglamsal Ta - sarım Bilgisi Eri¸sim Sistemi ( BTBES ) – Contextual Design Information Retrieval System ( CDIRS ) – geli¸stirilmi¸s ve hayata ge¸cirilmi¸stir . Bu sistem tasarımın erken safhalarındaki arama motorlarının yararını arttırmak ve tasarım bilgisi arama - larındaki baˇglamları a¸cık¸ca g¨or¨ul¨ur , kaydedilebilir ve ta¸sınabilir yapmak i¸cin ta - sarımcılar ve arama motorlarını kesi¸stirir . Bu sistem ayrıca tasarımcının tasarım bilgisini arama yolunun doˇgasına uymak ¨uzere geli¸stirimi¸stir . Dahili testler yapıldıktan sonra , bir tasarım projesinin erken safhalarında bil - ¨OZET 7 165 gi aramasının nasıl yapıldıˇgını benzetmek ¨uzere sistem birka¸c davetli kullanıcı tarafından kullanıldı . Bu kullanıcılar g¨ozlemlenerek baˇglam - kurma ve baˇglam - kullanma ¨ornekleri BTBES kullanılarak yapıldı . Akademik ve end¨ustriyel tecr¨ubesi olan uzmanlardan olu¸san bir deˇgerlendirme j¨urisi kuruldu . Akademik uzmanların teorik olarak daha g¨u¸cl¨u , end¨ustriyel uz - manların yeni ve pratik tasarım problemlerine daha a¸sina oldukları varsayımları yapıldı . J ¨ uri ¨ uyelerinden BTBES sistemini ¸calı¸stırmalarını istemektense , sistem ¨uyelere a¸cıklandı . Bu yolla sistem yetisi hakkında genel g¨or¨u¸s ve ardındaki baˇglam teorisi elde edilebilecekti . BTBES uygulanırken baˇglamın olu¸sumunu ve kullanımını g¨ostermek amacıyla iki tasarım ¨orneˇgi j¨uriye g¨osterildi . Bu g¨osterim uzmanların BTBES’le ilgili ( istek ¨uzerine ) ﬁkir vermelerine izin verecek ¸sekilde geli¸stirilmi¸s olmasına raˇgmen , uzmanlar sistemi uygulamalı olarak ara¸stırmacıyla yan yana tecr¨ube ettiler . Son olarak , uzmanlar soru formunu doldurup ﬁkirlerini vermeden ¨once BTBES’yi ger¸cek ve ¸simdiki tasarım problemleri i¸cin ¸calı¸stırmak istediler . Bu deˇgerlendirmenin sonucu olarak , BTBES’le hayata ge¸cirilen ’baˇglam’ kavramı ¨onermesi birka¸c k¨u¸c¨uk ¨oneriyle kabul edildi ve tasarım g¨orevlerinde ¸calı¸stıˇgı ispat edildi .

Pieter Jan Stappers is a full profes - sor of design techniques at Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering , Delft University of Techno - logy . His interests focus on developing techniques and tools that support designers ( and other crea - tive people ) in early phases of idea and concept development . He and his colleagues in Design Studio Lab , are developing the theory of ”con - textmapping” . Prof . ir . Daan van Eijk is a full professor of applied ergonomics and a practicer of consul - tancy for product development and innovation in Netherlands . He is also a member of the Dutch platform for product development ( Nederlands Platform Productontwikkeling - NPP ) . Vitae Muhammad Ikhwan ’ Iwan ’ Jambak was born in Palembang , Indonesia on Septem - ber 08 , 1969 . He ﬁnished secondary school in 1988 , and studied Chemical Engineer - ing at Sriwijaya University . Despite do - ing research in chemical labs as tradition - ally has been done by other students , he did a computer simulation of level control for his research that became the ﬁrst ever chemical engineering research at the fac - ulty using computers in the early 90’s . He graduated with his Bachelor of Engineer - ing degree in 1993 . Thereafter , he became a computer programmer in industry for several years before he went to Malaysia to ﬁnish his Master’s of Engineering in the ﬁeld of Computer Integrated Manu - facturing ( CIM ) at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering , Malaysia University of Technology . During this period , he was awarded as a junior researcher for the CIM project under a Malaysian government grant . While he was ﬁnishing his master’s thesis , he presented his research work and was accepted as a PhD stu - dent ( in Dutch : Assistent in Opleiding or AIO ) at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering , Delft University of Technology in March 2000 . In October 2000 he became a member of the Integrated Conceptual Advancement ( ICA ) project . He was assigned to explore new kinds of modeling entities called the nucleus . In mid 2002 , he moved and focused more on contextual design information retrieval in the early phase of design . Prior to the defense of this thesis , he was invited to be a member of the special interest group , ”Design Creativity” for the Design Society . 173 Appendix A – f - ﬁle Session 1 9 13 : 08 : 25 a [ ] 0 activity ( start _ of _ assignment ;

March 27 , 2007 10 : 00 AM March 27 , 2007 10 : 00 AM Context Knowledge Supporting Designers’ Information Search in the Early Design Phases MUHAMMAD IKHWAN JAMBAK The concept of context is used in many fields of research and applications . An architectural object can be understood from its context . The “Dome of Rock” architecture and the urban surrounding , can be understood in the context of Islam - Christian - Jews religions and the Arab - Israeli conflict . In this case , context is a kind of connection means between an architecture or urban design with social life and history . Another kind of connection gives a meaning to a group of matrix - style unstructured characters , as above . The characters are contextually grouped as “Context Knowledge” . This book explores the concept of context in order to support designers’ information search in the early design phases . The hypothesis is that the absence of context is the cause of difficulties to utilize data , information and knowledge surrounding designers
