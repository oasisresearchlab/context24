We set out to increase the image resolution of super - resolution fluorescence microscopy by combining 3D STORM 11 , 12 with a dual - objective detection scheme 13 , 14 ( Fig . 1a ) . In the original 3D STORM approach 12 , at any given instant , an optically resolvable subset of fluorescent probes are activated and imaged using a single objective . Astigmatism is introduced in the detection path using a cylindri - cal lens such that the images obtained for individual molecules are elongated in x and y directions for molecules on the proximal and distal sides of the focal plane , respectively . The lateral and axial coordinates of the molecules are determined from the centroid posi - tions and ellipticities of these single - molecule images , respectively . Through iteration of the activation and imaging cycles , the posi - tions of many molecules can be determined and a super - resolution image can be reconstructed from these molecular coordinates . It could be reasoned that total collected fluorescence signal would double by sandwiching the sample between two opposing objectives and detecting the signal from both objectives 13 , 14 . Because the local - ization uncertainty of each molecule scales with the inverse square root of the number of photons detected , doubling the photon count would yield a 1 . 4 - fold improvement in the image resolution . To characterize the localization precision of the dual - objective 3D STORM setup , we imaged individual Alexa Fluor 647 molecules scattered in fixed cells within ~ 150 nm of the focal plane , a range comparable to the thickness of the sheet - like cell protrusions . In this work , we use the term cell protrusion to refer to the thin region of the cell near its edge generally without dis - tinguishing protruding or retracting regions . Although we lim - ited our imaging z range to be comparable to the thickness of cell protrusions here , the imaging depth could be increased by stepping the sample in the z direction . As each Alexa Fluor 647 molecule can be switched on and off multiple times , we experi - mentally determined the localization precision by the standard deviation ( s . d . ) of repetitive localizations of the same molecule . Notably , the measured localization precisions , ~ 4 nm in the x and y directions and ~ 8 nm in the z direction ( Fig . 1b ) , are more than twofold greater than reported values with the same fluorophore using single - objective STORM 12 . This localization precision cor - responds to an image resolution of ~ 9 nm in the lateral directions and ~ 19 nm in the axial direction , measured in full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) . By examining the single - molecule images , we found that beyond the expected doubling of photon - collection efficiency ( Fig . 1c ) , the combination of astigmatism imaging and dual - objective detection provided a noise - cancelling mechanism that led to greater image dual - objective storm reveals three - dimensional filament organization in the actin cytoskeleton Ke Xu 1 , Hazen P Babcock 2 & Xiaowei Zhuang 1 , 3 by combining astigmatism imaging with a dual - objective scheme , we improved the image resolution of stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( storm ) and obtained < 10 - nm lateral resolution and < 20 - nm axial resolution when imaging biological specimens . using this approach , we resolved individual actin filaments in cells and revealed three - dimensional ultrastructure of the actin cytoskeleton . We observed two vertically separated layers of actin networks with distinct structural organizations in sheet - like cell protrusions . Recent advances in super - resolution fluorescence microscopy have substantially increased the spatial resolution of optical imag - ing 1 , 2 . In optical imaging of biological samples , resolutions down to ~ 20 nm have been achieved in lateral directions with axial resolutions of 10 – 100 nm ( refs . 1 , 2 ) . This enhanced resolution has enabled the visualization of various cellular ultrastructures previously inaccessible to optical methods . However , the current state - of - the - art resolution still cannot resolve many cellular struc - tures , and further improvement of resolution is desirable . For example , among the three major types of cytoskeletal struc - tures , individual microtubules and intermediate filaments can be observed with optical microscopy ; in contrast , individual actin filaments have not been resolved in cells by optical means , includ - ing super - resolution methods 3 – 6 , owing to the small diameter and high packing density of actin filaments . However , actin is crucial for many cellular processes 7 . In particular , the assembly and dis - assembly of actin filaments in the thin sheet - like cell protrusions drive cell locomotion 8 . The knowledge of how actin filaments are spatially organized is critical for understanding these processes . Although electron microscopy and cryo - electron tomography can resolve individual actin filaments in cells , three - dimensional ( 3D ) reconstructions are still challenging owing in part to the struc - tural perturbations induced by the dehydration and embedding treatment required for conventional electron microscopy and the difficulty in reconstructing large volumes by cryo - tomography 9 , 10 .

Molecules that were axially closer to one of the objectives were necessarily farther from the opposing one , leading to anti - correlated changes in the ellipticity detected by the two objectives ( Fig . 1d ) . In contrast , noises ( such as those caused by sample drift ) and abnormalities ( such as two nearby molecules with overlapping images that are misidentified as a single molecule ) led to correlated changes ( Fig . 1d ) . Using this effect , we cancelled noises by aver - aging the z measurements from the two channels , and identified and rejected abnormalities by examining the difference in the z positions obtained from the two objectives ( Online Methods ) . In addition , the mechanical stability of the dual - objective setup ( with the optical axis of the objectives parallel to the optical table and the sample vertically oriented ) was higher than that of the single - objective setup built on a standard inverted microscope . The syn - ergy of these effects led to substantially higher spatial resolution . Next , we tested these imaging capabilities on the actin cytoskel - eton ( Fig . 2 ) . To take full advantage of the high image resolution , we labeled the target structure using small organic molecules by staining actin filaments with Alexa Fluor 647 dye – labeled phal - loidin , which binds actin filaments with high specificity . We car - ried out STORM imaging through direct activation of Alexa Fluor 647 ( refs . 5 , 15 ) . Individual actin filaments were clearly resolved in dual - objective STORM images of fixed cells ( Fig . 2a , b ) . The cross - sectional profile of individual filaments showed a 12 - nm FWHM ( Fig . 2e ) . After accounting for the 9 - nm lateral image resolution , we derived the width of phalloidin - labeled actin filaments as ~ 8 nm ( ( 12 2 – 9 2 ) 1 / 2 ) , which agrees with the known diameter of actin ( 5 – 9 nm ) . Nearby filaments with a center - to - center distance of ~ 20 nm were also well resolved from each other ( Fig . 2f ) . In com - parison , we achieved lower resolution when we relied only on the information collected by one of the two objectives , and actin fila - ments were completely unresolvable in con - ventional fluorescent images ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Through volumetric imaging with 9 - nm lateral and 19 - nm axial resolutions , we obtained a holistic , 3D view of the actin networks with dual - objective STORM . b c a 200 – 40 – 20 0 2040 – 40 – 20 0 20 40 – 40 – 200 2040 – 40 – 20 0 20 40 0 0 Single objective Dual objective Photon count ( 10 3 ) 10 20 30 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 F r a c t i on ( a . u . ) Objective 1 Objective 2 Count σ z = 8 . 0 nm z ( n m ) 100 y ( nm ) – 40 40 – 20 100 200 0 0 20 C oun t σ y = 4 . 2 nm z ( n m ) x ( n m ) y ( n m ) d Lens Lens Laser Lens Lens Lens M M M M Lens Sample Obj . 1 Obj . 2LP Dichroic LP Slit Slit BP CL C C D x ( nm ) – 40 40 – 20 20 0 100 200 0 C oun t σ x = 3 . 9 nm figure 1 | Experimental setup and spatial resolution of dual - objective 3D STORM .

The apparent thickness of each layer was 30 – 40 nm ( Fig . 3d – f ) . The separation between the two layers was generally ~ 100 nm , but could be as small as ~ 50 nm ( Fig . 3d – f ) . Far from the cell edge and in the interior region , this separation increased to values much greater than 200 nm , suggesting that the two layers evolve into the cortical actin layers in the cell body . We also vali - dated the two - layer organization in living cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Similar to the x - y case , using only information obtained from one of the objectives led to substan - tially lower quality of the x - z cross - section images ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Although filaments in the two layers formed well - separated networks , thick fila - ment bundles occasionally connected the two layers ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Such bundles typically originated from adhesion plaques , ran through the ventral layer and gradually rose toward and ultimately reached the dorsal layer ( Supplementary Fig . 3b – d ) , likely representing dorsal stress fibers 16 . We also observed thick bundles connecting adhesion plaques on the ventral surface , likely representing ventral stress fibers 16 . In addition to these mature focal adhesions at the end of the thick actin bundles 17 , we also observed smaller and more isotropic adhesion complexes ( Supplementary Fig . 3e – h ) , prob - ably representing nascent adhesion complexes 17 . Actin filaments attached to these structures diverged in different directions . Notably , the two layers of actin networks often had highly distinct spatial organizations of actin filaments ( Fig . 3g , h ) . Whereas the dorsal layer appeared as a consistently dense and homogeneous meshwork , the ventral layer typically formed a web - like structure with a lower filament density and highly variable organization . We observed the two - layer arrangement in BSC - 1 epithelial cells ( Fig . 3a – h and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) and in COS - 7 fibroblast cells ( Supplementary Figs . 5 and 6 ) . The actin density in the dorsal layer was often several times higher than that in the ventral layer ( Supplementary Fig . 5f , i , j ) . Additional analysis suggests that the two - layer arrangement spans the lamellum and possibly extends into the lamellipodium ( Supplementary Results ) .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 188 | VOL . 9 NO . 2 | FEBRUARY 2012 | nature methods brief communications how these networks responded to different actomyosin - perturbing drugs . Cytochalasin D , a drug that inhibits actin polymerization , led to lower filament density as we expected ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) 18 . Latrunculin A , a drug that sequesters monomeric actin , also led to lower filament density as we expected 18 , but with the dorsal network substantially more disrupted than the ventral layer ( Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . This suggests that the dorsal layer is potentially more dynamic and thus more readily disrupted by actin monomer depletion . Notably , blebbistatin , an inhibitor for myosin II , removed the structural differences between the ventral and dorsal networks : both networks became uniform actin mesh - works of similar density , reminiscent of the dense , uniform dorsal network observed in untreated cells ( Fig . 3i – m ) . This suggests that myosin II has a key role in the structural organization of the ventral actin layer and in maintaining the structural differences between the dorsal and ventral actin networks . This function of myosin II is potentially related to its activities previously found in regulating actin disassembly , actin bundle formation and focal adhesion maturation ( Supplementary Discussion ) . By combining astigmatism imaging , dual - objective detection and small - molecule labeling in STORM , we have achieved an image resolution of < 10 nm in the lateral direction and < 20 nm in the axial direction . This lateral resolution is twofold or more higher than previously achieved for biological samples using super - resolution methods . Although higher axial resolutions have been reported using interferometry approaches 13 , 14 , the astigmatism - based system reported here is substantially simpler to implement . The ability to resolve individual actin filaments in cells using fluorescence microscopy opens new possibilities for study - ing numerous actin - related processes in cells . The two layers of continuous actin networks with distinct structures that we observed in sheet - like cell protrusions support and extend pre - vious understanding of the 3D ultrastructure of the actin cytoskel - eton 19 ( Supplementary Discussion ) . The high image resolution obtained with dual - objective STORM should also find use in many other biological systems . methods Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper at http : / / www . nature . com / naturemethods / .

Two infinity - corrected microscope objectives ( Olympus Super Apochromat UPLSAPO 100× , oil immersion , numerical aperture ( NA ) 1 . 40 ) were placed opposite each other and aligned to focus on the same spot of the sample . A piezoelec - tric actuator ( Thorlabs DRV120 ) was used to control the axial position of the sample with nanometer precision . The 647 - nm line from a Kr / Ar mixed - gas laser ( Innova 70C Spectrum , Coherent ) and the 405 - nm beam from a solid - state laser ( CUBE 405 - 50C , Coherent ) were introduced into the sample through the back focal plane of the first objective using a customized dichroic mirror that worked at an incident angle of 22 . 5° ( Chroma ) . Using a transla - tion stage , the laser beams were shifted toward the edge of the objective so that emerging light reached the sample at incidence angles slightly smaller than the critical angle of the glass - water interface , thus illuminating only the fluorophores within a few micrometers of the coverslip surface . The fluorescence emission was collected by both objectives . After passing through long - pass filters ( HQ665LP , Chroma ) , the two parallel light rays from the two objectives were each focused by a 20 - cm achromatic lens , cropped by a slit at the focal plane and then separately projected onto two different areas of the same electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( EM - CCD ) camera ( Andor iXon DU - 897 ) using two pairs of relay lenses . Astigmatism was introduced into the imaging paths of both objectives using a cylindrical lens so that the images obtained by each objective were elongated in the x and y directions for molecules on the proximal and distal sides of the focal plane ( relative to the objective ) , respectively . A band - pass filter ( ET700 / 75m , Chroma ) was installed on the camera . See Supplementary Protocol 1 for more details . Sample preparation . BSC - 1 and COS - 7 cells were plated on 18 - mm diameter , # 1 . 5 coated glass coverslips at a confluence of ~ 20 % . After 16 – 24 h , the cells were fixed and labeled according to protocols for ultrastructural studies of actin cytoskeleton 20 – 22 ( see Supplementary Protocol 2 for details ) . Briefly , the cells were initially fixed and extracted for 1 – 2 min using a solution of 0 . 3 % ( v / v ) glutaraldehyde and 0 . 25 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 in cytoskeleton buffer ( CB , 10 mM MES , pH 6 . 1 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM glucose and 5 mM MgCl 2 ) , and then post - fixed for 10 min in 2 % ( v / v ) glutaraldehyde in CB . The sample was treated with freshly prepared 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) sodium borohydride for 7 min to reduce background fluorescence . For vinculin staining ( when needed ) , the sample was first blocked with 3 % ( w / v ) BSA and 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , and then was stained with rabbit monoclonal vinculin antibodies ( Invitrogen 700062 ) followed by Cy3 - labled goat anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen A10520 ) . Actin filaments were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 - phalloidin ( Invitrogen A22287 ) overnight at 4 °C . A con - centration of ~ 0 . 5 µ M phalloidin in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS pH 7 . 4 ) was used . To minimize the dissociation of phalloidin from actin , the sample was briefly washed once with PBS and then immediately mounted for STORM imaging . For drug - effect studies , cells were incubated with culture medium containing 0 . 5 µ M cytochalasin D ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 0 . 25 µ M latrunculin A ( Invitrogen ) or 50 µ M ( − ) blebbistatin ( the active enantiomer ; Sigma - Aldrich ) at 37 °C for 1 h and then were fixed and labeled as described above . The STORM imaging buffer for fixed cells was PBS with 100 mM cysteamine , 5 % ( w / v ) glucose , 0 . 8 mg ml −1 glucose oxi - dase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 40 µ g ml −1 catalase ( Roche Applied Science ) . Imaging buffer ( ~ 4 µ l ) was dropped at the center of a freshly cleaned , # 1 . 5 rectangular coverslip ( 22 mm × 60 mm ) , and the sample on the 18 - mm diameter coverslip was mounted on the rectangular coverslip and sealed with nail polish . Image data acquisition . The sealed sample was mounted between the two opposing objectives . The 647 - nm laser was used to excite fluorescence from Alexa Fluor 647 molecules . Before acquiring STORM images , we used relatively weak 647 - nm light ( ~ 0 . 05 W cm −2 ) to illuminate the sample and recorded the conventional flu - orescence image before a substantial fraction of the dye molecules were switched off . We then increased the 647 - nm light intensity ( to ~ 2 kW cm −2 ) to rapidly switch the dyes off for STORM imag - ing . The 405 - nm laser was used to reactivate the fluorophores from the dark state back to the emitting state 23 . The power of the 405 - nm laser ( 0 – 1 W cm −2 ) was adjusted during image acquisi - tion so that at any given instant only a small , optically resolvable fraction of the fluorophores in the sample were in the emitting state . The EM - CCD camera acquired images from both objec - tives simultaneously at a frame rate of 60 Hz . Typically , ~ 90 , 000 frames were recorded to generate the final super - resolution image of the actin ultrastructure . Recording of more frames ( for exam - ple , 230 , 000 frames for Fig . 2 ) further increased the image quality at the expense of longer imaging time . Image data analysis . The recorded STORM data were first split into two movies , each of which comprises a sequence of images obtained by one of the two objectives . Each movie was first ana - lyzed separately as described previously 12 . The centroid positions and ellipticities of the single - molecule images provided lateral and axial positions of each activated fluorescent molecule , respec - tively . The molecular positions obtained by the second objective were mapped to the coordinates of the first objective through a transformation on the basis of corresponding features ( con - trol points ) in both images 24 . The mapped data from the two objectives were then compared frame by frame : molecules that were switched on within one frame of time and that were within ~ 50 nm of each other in the mapped x - y plane were identified as the same emitting molecule detected by both objectives . Nonmatching molecules were discarded . For each pair of matched molecules observed by the two objectives , the availability of two z positions obtained through the two objectives provides a new way to iden - tify abnormalities and cancel noise . Because the focal planes of the two opposing objectives coincided , a molecule on the proximal side of the focal plane of one objective would be on the distal side of the other objective . Therefore , its image would appear elongated in x through one objective but elongated in y through the other objective . A real change in the z position would cause anticorrelated changes in ellipticity measured through the two objectives ( Fig . 1d , green and blue arrows ) . Conversely , abnormalities and noise would tend to cause correlated changes in ellipticity . For example , when two nearby molecules with overlapping images were misi - dentified as a single molecule , the resultant images through both objectives would appear elongated in the same direction along the line connecting the two molecules ( Fig . 1d , magenta arrow ) . Likewise , any x - y drift of the stage or camera would also cause n p g © 2012 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature methods doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 1841 elongation in the same direction . These correlated changes in ellipticity led to apparently different z positions obtained through the two objectives ( ∆ z ) . The value of ∆ z can thus be used to iden - tify and reject abnormalities . These abnormalities ( identified by ∆ z greater than ~ 100 nm , which is substantially larger than the axial resolution of a single objective ) comprised ~ 10 % of all identified molecules . For molecule pairs that matched well with each other in all four ( spatial and temporal ) coordinates , the final coordinates were determined as the average of the mapped coor - dinates from the two objectives , weighted by the width of the image and number of photons obtained by each objective . This averaging procedure further reduced noise caused by errors , such as the correlated changes in ellipticity described above . The final super - resolution images were reconstructed from these molecular coordinates by depicting each location as a 2D Gaussian peak . Analysis software is available as Supplementary Software . To characterize the localization precision , we used fixed cell samples sparsely labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 . Relatively strong activation conditions were used such that each Alexa Fluor 647 molecule was activated multiple times during image acquisition and gave a cluster of localizations owing to repetitive activation . Under this sparsely labeled condition , we could readily identify individual clusters of localizations . Localizations from many such clusters within ~ 150 nm of the focal plane were aligned by their center of mass to generate the localization distribution reported in Figure 1b . The localization precision determined from these distributions was ~ 4 nm ( s . d . ) in the x and y directions and ~ 8 nm ( s . d . ) in the z direction . The variation in localization preci - sion across this region was small ( within 15 % of the average value ) . The localization precision determined from the sparsely labeled sample also represents the localization precision achieved in densely labeled actin samples as the parameters relevant for the localization precision , such as the number of photons detected from individual molecules and the background fluorescence sig - nal , were measured to be the same for both sparsely and densely labeled samples . For STORM imaging of the densely labeled actin samples , rela - tively weak 405 - nm activation intensities were used during image acquisition . This led to a typical linear localization density of one localization per 4 nm along individual actin filaments for ~ 90 , 000 frames , which corresponds to a Nyquist criterion – based resolution of 8 nm , smaller than the 9 - nm lateral and 19 - nm axial resolu - tions determined above . As we had not exhausted all of the labeled molecules by the end of image acquisition , the number of localiza - tions can be further increased by increasing the imaging time . For the characterization of the widths of individual actin fila - ments , we chose short ( ~ 200 nm ) , straight segments of filaments in cells along which no crossing or branching of filaments was observed . Analysis of eight such segments yielded FWHM widths of 12 ± 2 nm . 20 . Small , J . V . , Rottner , K . , Hahne , P . & Anderson , K . I . Microsc . Res . Tech . 47 , 3 – 17 ( 1999 ) . 21 .
