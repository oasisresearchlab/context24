The lines were derived from TH - positive tumors in transgenic mice carrying the SV40 T antigen oncogene under the transcriptional control of 773 base pairs of 5’ flanking sequences from the rat TH gene . Although the lines continue to express T antigen , they exhibit neuronal properties such as neurofilaments and synapto - physin and lack glial intermediate filaments . Although in viva TH is only expressed in postmitotic neurons in the CNS , the CATH . a line demonstrates that TH expression and continued cell division are not incompatible after oncogenic transfor - mation . [ Key words : noradrenergic cell lines , tyrosine - hydroxy - lase , SV40 T antigen , transgenic mice , brain tumor , cate - cholamines ] Immortalized cell lines of differentiated neuronal cell types can be valuable research tools because they provide homogeneous sources of single cell types . They can be used to elucidate mech - anisms of induction without the complicating presence of non - target cells , a situation impossible to achieve in vivo or in mixed primary cultures . They can also serve as sources of cell - specific molecules , as recipients for such molecules in gene transfer ex - periments , or as sources for cell transplants into the nervous system . Neuronal cell lines from the CNS are especially valuable since it is difficult to prepare pure populations of primary neu - rons . In addition , few differentiated cell lines originating from the CNS exist . Neuronal cell lines have been generated by four methods : ( 1 ) from spontaneously arising or chemically induced tumors , ( 2 ) by fusion of neurons to neuroblastoma cells , ( 3 ) by retroviral infection of neural precursor cells , and ( 4 ) by the use of onco - genes driven by cell - specific promoters that direct tumorigenesis Received June 5 , 1992 ; revised Sept . 21 , 1992 ; accepted Sept . 30 , 1992 .

Although many cell lines have been derived from spontaneous or induced tumors , the majority are relatively undifferentiated ( Spengler et al . , 1973 ; Schubert et al . , 1974 ; Waymire and Gilmer - Waymire , 1978 ) . Many have a mixed neuronal and glial phenotype characteristic of very immature cell types . The PC12 cell line ( Greene and Tischler , 1976 ) and some mouse C - 1300 subclones ( Amano et al . , 1972 ) do exhibit some differentiated properties . However , these lines are derived from the PNS . Somatic cell hybrids offer the potential for obtaining immortalized cells with a well - dif - ferentiated phenotype , since mature CNS neurons can theoret - ically be used as fusion partners . Unfortunately , the success rate of such fusions is low and most researchers have relied on em - bryonic neuronal tissue to obtain hybrids that resemble mature neurons to varying degrees ( Lee et al . , 1990 ; Choi et al . , 199 1 ) . An additional major drawback of somatic cell hybrids is the extent to which the neuroblastoma partner may influence the resulting hybrid , since the neuroblastoma parent is of PNS or - igin . This is of concern because hybrids contain additional chro - mosomes derived from the neuroblastoma parent and often lose those from the non - neuroblastoma parent . Recently , mesen - cephalic hybrid lines have been established by the fusion of embryonic mesencephalic cells with a neuroblastoma line ( Choi et al . , 199 1 ; Crawford et al . , 1992 ) . Although these lines resem - ble mature midbrain neurons , they synthesize not only dopa - mine ( DA ) but also norepinephrine ( NE ) , which is surprising since mature mesencephalic cells are exclusively dopaminergic ( Bjorklund and Lindvall , 1984 ) . Some of these problems can be circumvented by generating cell lines with retroviral or trans - genie technologies . Retroviral infection of primary neuronal cul - tures can result in neuronal cell lines capable of undergoing differentiation under appropriate conditions ( Cepko , 1989 ; Len - dahl and McKay , 1990 ) . Since the virus requires at least one round of cell division in order to integrate into the host’s ge - nome , this approach has been largely limited to the immortal - ization of cycling precursor cells ( Fredericksen et al . , 1988 ; Ry - der et al . , 1990 ) . Transplantation experiments have shown that these precursor cells retain their plasticity when implanted into a developing brain , giving rise to cells appropriate for the site of implant ( Renfranz et al . , 199 1 ; Snyder et al . , 1992 ) . Retroviral infection has thus been of greatest use for lineage analyses and other developmental studies . The most direct approach to create cell lines of defined neu - ronal cell types utilizes tissue - specific promoter elements to di - rect oncogene expression in transgenic mice ( Cory and Adams , 1988 ; Jenkins and Copeland , 1989 ) . In this way , very specific cells may be targeted . In the last few years this technique has led to the immortalization of gonadotropin - releasing hormone The Journal of Neuroscience , March 1993 , 133 ) 1281 ( GnRH ) - cxpressing and retinal amacrine neurons ( Hammang et al . , 1990 ; Mellon et al . , 1990 ) , as well as for differentiated cells of many non - neuronal tissues ( Hanahan , 1989 ) . Since the target cell destined for transformation is determined by the reg - ulatory promoter elements used , in theory tumors can be in - duced in any cell type for which specific regulatory elements are available . For the most part , tumors have been observed in the appropriate tissues , although ectopic expression does occur ( Behringer et al . , 1988 ; Cory and Adams , 1988 ) . We have used the upstream elements of the rat tyrosine hy - droxylase ( TH ) gene to drive the SV40 T antigen ( Tag ) oncogene to generate tumors in the TH - producing cells of the CNS and PNS . TH is the first and the rate - limiting enzyme in the cate - cholamine biosynthetic pathway . It converts L - tyrosine into di - hydroxyphenylalanine ( L - dopa ) , from which are sequentially synthesized DA , NE , and epinephrine ( E ) such that all cate - cholamine - producing cells express TH . The 5’ upstream regu - latory region of the TH gene has been well studied ( Lewis et al . , 1987 ; Cambi et al . , 1989 ; Fader and Lewis , 1990 ; Gizang - Gins - berg and Ziff , 1990 ; Yoon and Chikaraishi , 1992 ; Banerjee et al . , 1992 ; Fung et al . , 1992 ) , and elements necessary for cell - specific expression in cultured cells ( Yoon and Chikaraishi , 1992 ; Fung et al . , 1992 ) and in transgenic mice ( Kaneda et al . , 199 1 ; Banerjee et al . , 1992 ) have been defined . The expression of TH in the nervous system has been well established . It has a specific tissue distribution in the CNS in discrete nuclei mainly in the olfactory bulb ( OB ) , midbrain , and brainstem regions ( Bjork - lund and Lindvall , 1984 ) . In the PNS it is most abundant in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and in sympathetic ganglia ( Rothman et al . , 1980 ) . In the rodent CNS ( excluding the OB ) , the total number of TH - producing cells is less than 70 , 000 , scattered across a number of sites , which makes the isolation of pure populations of TH - positive cells very difficult . Since TH in the CNS is expressed only in postmitotic neurons ( Specht et al . , 198 l ) , immortalization of TH - expressing neurons using retroviruses is unlikely . SV40 Tag has been shown to induce tumors in a wide variety of tissues . Though other oncogenes such as c - myc and H - rus have been demonstrated to induce tumors ; they are relatively restricted in the types of tissues that they can transform ( Davis et al . , 1987 ; Sinn et al . , 1987 ) . SV40 Tag , on the other hand , has been successful in inducing tumors in many cell types and , in particular , has been used to generate tumors in endocrine and neural tissues . For example , endocrine pancreatic tumors have been induced when Tag was under the control of the pro - moters for insulin ( Hanahan , 1985 ) , glucagon ( Efrat et al . , 1988 ) , and vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP , Murphy et al . , 1987 ) ; anterior pituitary tumors were produced with the promoters for VIP ( Murphy et al . , 1987 ) and glycoprotein hormone a - subunit ( Windle et al . , 1990 ) ; retinal and adrenal gland tumors were obtained with the phenylethanolamine N - methyl transferase ( PNMT ) promoter ( Baetge et al . , 1988 ) and hypothalamic tu - mors have been generated with the GnRH promoter ( Mellon et al . , 1990 ) . We report here the immortalization of cells from the brain and adrenal glands of transgenic mice bearing SV40 Tag under the control of 773 base pairs ( bp ) of the upstream regulatory region of the rat TH gene . We have established three cell lines that possess a neuronal phenotype , indicated by the presence of neurofilament ( NF ) proteins and the absence of glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) . The lines are strongly catecholaminergic , synthesizing high levels of TH enzyme and producing both DA and NE . They also contain synaptophysin , a protein specific to small synaptic vesicles in neurons and related small vesicles in neuroendocrine cells ( Navone et al . , 1986 ; Johnston et al . , 1989 ) . Materials and Methods Plusmid construction . A Nar - Nar fragment ( - 19 to 2562 ) was deleted from - 4 . 8 THCAT ( Cambi et al . , 1989 ) and replaced with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing TH sequences from - 19 to + 10 followed by three unique sites ( SmaI , NruI , SalI ) and NarI half - sites at either end . The resulting plasmid , 4 . 8 THO , contains 4 . 8 kilobases ( kb ) of upstream TH and 10 bp of TH 5’ untranslated region followed by the SmaI , NruI , and Sal1 sites . The plasmid retains an ampicillin - resistance gene and a colE1 , origin of replication . A 2 . 7 kb St + BamHl fragment from wild - type SV40 DNA ( Fiers et al . , 1978 ) was blunt ended and inserted into the unique SmaI site of 4 . 8THO to generate 4 . 8THTag . Digestion with XhoI and Sal1 yielded a linear piece of DNA containing the complete coding sequence for Tag ( 2 . 7 kb ) under the control of - 773 bn of TH . The DNA was nurified from aaarose aels bv the sodium perchlorate method ( Chen and Thomas , 1985 ) and - resuspended at a concentration of 5 rig / d for injections . Transgenic mice . The procedures were done essentially as described by Hogan et al . ( 1986 ) . DNA was injected into the male pronucleus of recently fertilized eggs from B6 / D2 Fl donor mice ( Taconic Labs ) . Following an overnight incubation at 37”C , the two - cell embryos were implanted into the oviducts of pseudopregnant CD - 1 females ( Charles River Labs . ) . Pups bearing the transgene were identified by a tail blot in which DNA from a tail segment was isolated , bound to nitrocellulose filters , and probed with a radiolabeled DNA fragment corresponding to Tag . Pups were screened for the presence of an un - rearranged transgene by Southern analysis ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ) . Cell culture . Tumors were removed under sterile conditions and cut into small pieces . These were mechanically triturated in RPM1 1640 medium containing 0 . 018 % type I collagen & e ( Worthington Biochem - ical Corp . ) with 0 . 2 % bovine serum albumin ( Sigma ) and placed at 37°C for 20 - 25 min . The reaction was stopped by the ‘addition of serum - containing medium , and the cells were triturated again and pelleted . They were then plated onto tissue culture plastic and grown in medium containing RPM1 1640 supplemented with 8 % horse serum ( Hyclone ) , 4 % fetal bovine serum ( GIBCO ) , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( stocks of 10 . 000 U / ml nenicillin G and 10 , 000 & ml strentomvcin sulfate : Irvine Scientific ) and 20 U / ml nystatin ( GIBCO ) . The - mixed primary cultures were passaged once a week using 0 . 12 % trypsin without EDTA ( Irvine Scientific ) . Even in primary cultures , few glial or fibroblastic cells were evident . For cloning purposes , cells were grown at a low density and glass cylinders were used to isolate individual colonies that were trit - urated to clumps of l - 10 cells in the presence of 0 . 12 % trypsin ( without EDTA ) , and replated at cloning densities . This procedure was performed three times . A more rigorous treatment to obtain only single cells was not successful even when different substrata or conditioned media from healthy cultures were used for culturing . PATH . 1 was grown on dishes coated with poly - L - lysine ( Sigma ) at a concentration of 100 & ml to improve attachment . This procedure did not affect the properties of the cell line . Irnmunohistochemisty . Tissues and tumors were immersed in Bouin’s fixative ( 75 ml saturated picric acid , 25 ml 37 % formaldehyde , 5 ml glacial acetic acid ) for 4 hr to overnight depending on tissue thickness , after which time they were treated as required for cryostat or paraffin sectioning . Cryostat ( 9 - l 2 pm ) and paraffin ( 6 pm ) sections were usually placed on 0 . 01 % poly + lysine - coated slides . Cell lines were grown on poly - L - lysine - coated glass coverslips placed in a 24 - well plate , and were fixed by a 15 min exposure to Bouin’s fixative . Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 3 % ) in potassium phosphat + buffered saline ( TKPBS ) was used for permeabilization and was present until the enzymatic reaction was performed in the last step of the procedure . Hydrogen peroxide ( 1 % ) in absolute methanol was added to the sections or cells for 20 min to reduce background due to endogenous peroxidase activity . For Tag detection , tissue sections were treated with 0 . 003 % bacterial protease XXIV ( Sigma ) in TKPBS for 15 min . This treatment partially digested the cellular proteins , including Tag , thereby better exposing the antigens . Since the proteolytic treatment tended to increase background staining , these sections were routinely blocked with avidin followed by biotin ( blocking kit , Vector Labs ) . These solutions were used undiluted and as provided by the supplier . All sections and cells were incubated in 2 % normal goat serum ( Vector Labs ) and 1 % Carnation nonfat dry 1282 Suri et al . . Catecholaminergic Cell Lines with the TH - SV40 Tag Transgene milk in TKPBS for 30 min to block nonspecific binding prior to ad - dition of primary antibody . Primary antibody incubations were at 4°C for l - 3 d depending on the antigen . TH antiserum ( Eugene Tech . ) was a rabbit polyclonal an - tiserum against bovine TH . It was used at a dilution of 1 : 250 or 1 : 500 , depending on the batch . Tag antiserum ( rabbit polyclonal ) was a gift from Dr . D . Hanahan ( UCSF ) and was used at a 1 : 5000 dilution for tissue sections and at a 1 : 10 , 000 dilution for cells . Anti - synaptophysin was a rabbit polyclonal against the rat antigen . It was a gift of Dr . J . Wang ( Tufts Univ . ) and was used at a dilution of 1 : 200 . Antibodies against the medium chain of NF and GFAP were gifts of Dr . V . Lee ( Univ . Penn . ) . Anti - NF , a mouse monoclonal , was used at a dilution of l : lO , and anti - GFAP , a rat monoclonal , at a dilution of 1 : lOO . The buffer for dilutions contained 1 % Carnation nonfat dry milk in T / KPBS with 0 . 02 % sodium azide . Sections were covered with glass coverslips to prevent drying . Biotinylated secondary antibodies ( goat anti - rabbit , horse anti - mouse , and goat anti - rat ) were obtained from Vector Labs and used at a dilution of I : 200 in TKPBS with 1 % Carnation milk for 2 hr at room temperature . Antibody reactions were visualized with an enzymatic assay utilizing the peroxidase enzyme linked to avidin ( ABC kit , Vector Labs ) . Sections and cells were incubated in the ABC mix for 1 hr at room temperature . Diaminobenzidine ( at 40 mg / 100 ml in Tris - buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 ) and hydrogen peroxide ( at 0 . 003 % ) acted as substrates and NiCl ( at 0 . 04 % ) as an enhancer for the reaction , which was allowed to proceed until the blue - black color was visible , but not more than 20 min . All sections and cells were dehydrated in ethanol and xylene , and permanently mounted with Permount ( Fisher Scien - tific ) . TH enzyme activity ( modified from Rittenhouse et al . , 1988 ) . Cells were grown to 70 % confluency on 65 mm plates . They were rinsed twice with cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , scraped off , and pelleted at 10 , 000 rpm for 10 min . The pellet was homogenized in 150 ~ 1 of a buffer containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 5 mM Tris ( pH 6 . 0 ) and recen - trifuged . The supematant ( 10 ~ 1 aliquots ) was assayed in duplicate at 37°C for 6 min in a reaction mix consisting of 200 mM KI - IPO , ( pH 6 . 0 ) 3 . 2 mM 6 - methyl - 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 - tetrahydropterin , 80 WM L - tyrosine , 300 PM brocresine , 40 mM p - mercaptoethanol , and 2 x 1 OS U / ml catalase . Eoinenhrine ( 25 nmol ) in 0 . 1 mM EDTA and 0 . 5 M Tris ( nH 8 . 6 ) was used to stop the reaction . Catecholamines were allowed to bind to acid - washed alumina for 15 min with constant shaking . The alumina was then pelleted and washed twice with 0 . 1 M NaHSO , in 0 . 5 M Tris ( pH 8 . 6 ) . The bound catechols were eluted with 0 . 1 M H , PO , , 0 . 1 mM EDTA and quantitated by HPLC . Protein content in an aliquot of the super - natant usedlfor the assay was determined by the method of Lowry et al . ( 1951 ) . DBH enzyme activity ( modified from Sperk et al . , 1980 ) . Cells were grown and pelleted as - above . They were son & ted after resuspension in cold 50 mM sodium acetate DH 6 . 0 with 1 % Triton X - 100 . After one freeze - thaw cycle , they were centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 10 min . Protein content in the supematant was measured by the method of Lowry et al . ( 1951 ) . Protein ( 10 pg ) was added to 100 ~ 1 of 1 % concan - avalin A Sepharose 4B beads in 50 mM sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 5 ) . Do - pamine P - hydroxylase ( DBH ) was allowed to adsorb to the beads for 15 min at 4°C and the beads were pelleted at 12 , 000 rpm for 3 min . They were washed three times with ice water and resuspended in 200 ~ 1 of 50 mM sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 5 ) . The enzymatic assay was per - formed at 37°C for 30 min using 100 ~ 1 of DBH - bound beads in a final reaction volume of 200 ~ 1 . The reaction mix contained 3 mM dopamine , 4 mM ascorbic acid , 40 mM fumarate , 0 . 6 mM pargyline , 700 U of catalase , 3 PM copper sulfate , and 50 mM sodium acetate ( pH 5 . 5 ) . The reaction was stopped by chilling on ice and with the addition of 0 . 5 volumes of 2 M Tris ( pH 8 . 6 ) . The catecholamines were extracted with alumina as described for the TH assav and detected bv HPLC . 7 . 0 ) . RNA was transferred to a Genescreen membrane by passive cap - illary flow for at least 20 hr , and cross - linked to the membrane by exposure to 1600 J of UV radiation . The membrane was prehybridized for at least 5 hr at 42°C in a buffer containing 50 % formamide , 5 x SSC , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 1 % sodium pyrophosphate , 120 & ml salmon sperm DNA , 10 x Denhardt’s reagent , and 10 % dextran sulfate . Hybridization was done overnight under similar conditions in the presence of a radioactive probe . The membrane was washed at 65°C under stringent conditions and exposed to Kodak XOMat film for autoradiography . Sources of DNA for making radiolabeled probes were as follows : TH plasmid RR1 . 2 , Cambi et al . ( 1989 ) ; NF plasmid , gift of Dr . N . Cowan , NYU ; and PNMT plasmid , gift of Dr . E . Weisberg , Univ . of Pittsburgh . DNA probes with an average specific activity of 180 million cpm / pg were made by random priming of the intact TH and PNMT plasmids ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ) . NF RNA probe of a similar specific activity was made according to standard protocols . Determination of total catecholamines . Cells were grown on 65 mm plates , washed twice with ice - cold PBS , and scraped off mechanically . The cell pellet was homogenized in 0 . 1 N HClO , and 1 mM EDTA . After centrifugation for 10 min at 10 , 000 rpm , the supematant was neutralized with 0 . 5 vol of 2 M Tris ( pH 8 . 6 ) and adsorbed to acid - washed alumina . Following this step , the procedure was as described for the TH enzyme assay . In order to measure the amount of catecho - lamines in the supematant , cells were fed with fresh media 24 hr before the catecholamines were extracted . Western blots . Cell pellets were resuspended in electrophoresis buffer ( 3 % SDS , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 064 M Tris pH 6 . 8 , 2 % P - mercaptoethanol ) , placed in a boiling water bath for 5 mitt , and stored at - 70°C . Protein content in an aliquot was measured by the method of Lowry et al . ( 195 1 ) . One hundred microliters of the mix ( containing 67 pg total protein ) were loaded per lane onto an 8 % acrylamide - SDS gel . The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to an Immobilon membrane ( Millipore ) . Nonspecific binding was reduced by incubating the membrane for 1 hr in Tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( TBST ) and 3 % Car - nation nonfat dry milk . It was then exposed to anti - synaptophysin serum at a 1 : 500 dilution in the same buffer for 1 . 5 hr at room temperature . Following three washes in TBST buffer with 3 % milk , horseradish per - oxidase linked to donkey anti - rabbit antibody was added at a 1 : 2000 dilution for 40 min at room temperature . The membrane was washed three times in TBST and the bands visualized by an ECL detection system ( Amersham ) . Results TH - expressing tumors in transgenic mice bearing a TH - Tag transgene . A 783 bp region of the rat TH gene , containing 773 bp of 5’ upstream DNA and the first 10 bp of untranslated mRNA , was linked to the complete coding region of the wild - type SV40 Tag ( Fiers et al . , 1978 ) . The hybrid gene contained the mRNA initiation site at + 1 from the TH gene and the translation start site from the Tag sequence that also provided the natural splice sites and the polyadenylation site . This lin - earized construct , devoid of plasmid sequences , was injected into fertilized B6 / D2 Fl ova . Seven of the 21 pups contained the transgene in their DNA . Southern analysis showed deletions in the transgene in two of these founders ( data not shown ) , which were therefore discarded ; the other founders contained one to five copies of un - rearranged TH - Tag transgene . One female founder , # 17 , died at 10 weeks of age during pregnancy from a massive adrenal tumor that occupied the top left quadrant of the abdominal cavity . The other four founders bred successfully but mice in three lineages were nonexpressors . The remaining founder , # 20 , established a lineage in which the progeny con - sistently developed brain tumors . The age of the animals at the onset of tumors varied from 15 weeks to 8 . 5 months . It is likely that all animals of this lineage will develop tumors with time . In all cases the tumor - bearing mice demonstrated motor diffi - culties , and exhibited a hunched posture and an enlarged head . Upon death , the mice were found to have tumors on the ventral HPLC . A C - 18 reverse - phase colu’mn ( Beckman do . ) was used in combination with an electrochemical detector ( Waters ) . The mobile phase contained 7 . 5 % methanol , 50 mM NaH , PO , ( pH 3 . 6 ) , 0 . 387 mM sodium octyl sulfate , and 0 . 1 mM EDTA . Northern analysis . Cells were grown on 150 mm plates . PolyA + RNA was prepared using the Fast Track mRNA isolation kit ( Invitrogen ) . Northems were performed as described ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ) using 2 fig of polyA + RNA per lane of a 1 % formaldehyde - agarose gel . Molecular weight markers ranging in size from 0 . 24 to 9 . 49 kb were purchased from Bethesda Research Labs . After electrophoresis the gel was im - mersed in 0 . 05 N NaOH for 20 min , rinsed in DEPC - treated H , O , and equilibrated in 1 x SSC buffer ( 0 . 15 M NaCl , 15 mM sodium citrate , pH The Journal of Neuroscience , March 1993 . 73 ( 3 ) 1283 Figure 1 .

No organ other than the brain and adrenal glands developed a tumor in any of the transgenic mice , nor was there Tag staining in any of the other organs . Sections from the tumors were either treated for immuno - histochemical analysis or placed in tissue culture medium . Mor - phologically , both the adrenal and brain tumors resemble neu - roblastomas composed of small , densely packed , undifferentiated cells with scant cytoplasm . Figure 1 illustrates a typical staining pattern for TH and Tag proteins in adrenal and brain tumor sections . Whereas Tag can be seen in all the cells of the tumor , albeit at a variable intensity , TH is patchy in its distribution , appearing primarily in cells within a group or nodule . Interest - ingly , in lineage 20 , expression of Tag is also observed in scat - tered cell nuclei in nontumorigenic brain areas that lack TH - positive cell bodies . In these areas , which include the midbrain , brainstem , and specific layers in the cortex and cerebellum , stained nuclei can be seen intermingled with unstained cells ( Fig . le ) . This ectopic distribution of the Tag protein was also ob - ” served in the brains of siblings that had not yet developed a tumor . With - 773 bp of TH , therefore , Tag was observed in regions that were both appropriate ( brain and adrenal glands ) and in - appropriate ( non - TH - producing brain cells ) . However in some TH - positive regions like the OB and superior cervical ganglia ( SCG ) , Tag expression was never detected , suggesting that 773 bp of 5’ TH information is not sufficient for a completely ap - propriate in vivo expression . Derivation of immortalized cell lines . Primary tumor cells from the adrenal tumor of founder female 17 and from a brain tumor of a male offspring of founder 20 were grown as mixed cultures for 3 - 5 months . Cell lines were then isolated from both the adrenal and brain tumor cultures as described in Materials and Methods . These lines were derived by isolation ofindividual clumps of l - 10 cells that were plated at cloning density . The progeny of each clump were subjected to at least two additional 1284 Suri et al . * Catecholaminergic Cell Lines with the TH - SV40 Tag Transgene t i - Figure 2 .

After the first cycle , cells were tested for the presence of TH by immunochemical means . Approxi - mately 50 % of the adrenal lines and 12 % of the brain lines contained TH . From the adrenal culture , two cell lines , PATH . 1 and PATH . 2 ( for peripheral adrenergic TH - expressing ) , have been studied extensively . They have been passaged at least once a week since February 199 1 . The brain culture yielded one strongly catecholaminergic cell line , CATH . a ( for central ad - renergic TH - expressing ) , which has been cultured since April 1991 . CATH . a and PATH . 2 attach well to uncoated plastic tissue culture dishes , whereas PATH . 1 adheres less well to stan - dard culture plates . All three cell lines have since been frozen in liquid nitrogen and successfully thawed . Figure 2 shows the morphology and immunochemical stain - ing patterns for TH and Tag in these three cell lines . All three lines grow in clumps , lack appreciable processes , and appear relatively undifferentiated , with large nuclei and scant cyto - plasm . They maintain this morphology when plated on poly - L - lysine , collagen , laminin , or irradiated mouse NIH3T3 cells , or in defined media in the absence of serum . However , they stain very strongly for TH and Tag . The expected compartmentali - zation of TH and Tag is evident in that the TH antibody stains the cytoplasm , while the Tag staining is restricted to the nucleus . While Tag staining is very robust and homogeneous , staining for TH is typically heterogeneous and of variable intensity . The same result was obtained with both a rabbit polyclonal and a mouse monoclonal antibody against TH . We have observed a similar heterogeneity in the PC8b cell line , a subclone of the PC12 cell line ( Tank et al . , 1990 ) . The reason for this hetero - geneity is not clear . To test the possibility that TH is expressed only in nondividing cells , cells were grown in bromodeoxyuri - dine ( BUdR ) for 1 hr before fixation and double stained with anti - TH and anti - BUdR antibodies . A high proportion of TH - positive cells was found to be BUdR = labeled ( data not shown ) , The Journal of Neuroscience , March 1993 . 13 ( 3 ) 1285 K 1 . 9 kb 123456 Figure 3 .

Non - catecholaminergic cell lines such as NIH3T3 and ATT20 failed to stain with either TH or Tag antiserum ( data not shown ) . TH mRNA expression in cell lines . To confirm biochemically that TH is expressed in these cells , a Northern analysis was performed on polyA + RNA . Figure 3 shows that all three TH - Tag lines have a strong band at 1 . 9 kb , the position of TH mRNA . As expected , PC8b cells show this band although at a reduced level compared to the TH - Tag lines , and the negative cell lines NIH3T3 and B103 ( a CNS neuroblastoma ) do not . The three TH - Tag cell lines therefore contain abundant TH mRNA as judged by Northern blot analysis , and TH protein as judged by immunocytochemistry . Activities of catecholaminergic enzymes in cell lines . To de - termine whether the TH protein is enzymatically active , we measured TH activity in vitro . Table 1 shows that PATH . l , PATH . 2 , and CATH . a have TH - specific activities of 776 , 233 , and 1129 pmol / mg protein / min , respectively . Since the next enzyme in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway , dopa - de - carboxylase , is found in most cells , the three cell lines should be capable of synthesizing the first major catecholamine , DA . To determine if the cells synthesize the second catecholamine in the pathway , NE , we assayed for DBH , which converts DA to NE . As Table 1 indicates , all three cell lines contain an active form of DBH , which suggests that these cells should also produce Table 1 .

NE if the required cofactors for TH and DBH are also present in the cells . Catecholamine production in cell lines . To evaluate cate - cholamine production directly , DA and NE were measured in cell extracts by a reverse - phase HPLC system . As with the en - zymatic assays , cells were plated in equal numbers and grown to similar densities before the catecholamines were extracted . High levels of both DA and NE can be detected in the cell extracts , while E was not detected even under conditions of high sensitivity . DA levels in all three cell types are higher than the NE levels , the ratio of DA to NE being approximately 1 . 9 for PATH . 1 , 2 . 5 for PATH . 2 , and 2 . 4 for CATH . a ( Table 2 ) . Anal - ysis of the tissue - culture medium also revealed large amounts of the two catecholamines ( Table 2 ) as well as of their degra - dation products ( data not shown ) , suggesting a high basal se - cretion and turnover . Taken together with the enzyme assays , these results suggest that all three cell lines are noradrenergic . The lack of E in these cell lines is consistent with the absence of mRNA for PNMT , the enzyme required for the conversion of NE to E . Figure 4 shows that only RNA from the adrenal gland contains the 1 . 1 kb band specific to PNMT . None of the other cell lines , including PC1 2 , were found to possess this RNA species . Expression of a neuronal phenotype . The lines were assayed for the expression of NF , the intermediate filaments character - istic of neurons ( Lazarides , 1982 ) . NFs are composed of three separate proteins of 68 kDa ( light chain ) , 150 kDa ( medium chain ) , and 200 kDa ( heavy chain ) ( Hoffman and Lasek , 1975 ) . Figure 5a - c shows the immunocytochemical results with mono - clonal antibodies against the medium chain of NF . Reaction product is clearly visible in patches near the periphery of all Table 2 .

Lane 8 contains RNA from mouse adrenal glands as a positive control . Arrow indicates the correct size of the mRNA species . All lanes are from the same gel and blot . three cell types . The distribution of NF within cells is variable but when present it is always cytoplasmic . In contrast , when cells were stained with an antibody against GFAP , the inter - mediate filament characteristic of glial cells , no reaction was detected ( Fig . 5d - f . To confirm the presence of NF using an alternate approach , mRNA from the cell lines was analyzed for the presence of the NF light chain . In Figure 6 the two RNA species of 2 . 5 kb and 4 . 0 kb ( Lewis and Cowan , 1985 ) encoding the light chain RNA are readily apparent in PATH . 1 and CATH . a , while PATH . 2 has less of the 68 kDa NF RNA . Nevertheless , these data in conjunction with the antibody staining demonstrate that all three lines express NFs and lack GFAP , suggesting a neuronal or neuroendocrine origin . Control cell lines , NIH3T3 and B103 , lack NF RNA . Expression of synaptophysin . A polyclonal antibody against synaptophysin ( ~ 38 ) exhibits a similar and distinct staining pat - tern in all three lines . The staining is largely confined to a single , intense spot near the nucleus ( Fig . 7 ) . Control experiments showed no staining when primary antiserum was omitted or when a non - neuronal cell line , NIH3T3 , was used . Synaptophysin in neurons and endocrine cells is subject to differential modification by glycosylation and sulfation , result - ing in multiple forms on SDS gels ( Navone et al . , 1986 ; Regnier - Vigouroux et al . , 199 1 ) . To determine if indeed there were mo - lecular differences in the protein between the three cell lines , a Western blot using the same polyclonal antibody was performed . As shown in Figure 8 , all three cell lines contain p38 proteins ( indicated by a bracket ) that can be resolved into several closely migrating species . PATH . 1 has a higher level of synaptophysin than PATH . 2 and has fewer different isoforms that can be re - solved on SDS gels . CATH . a has the highest concentration of p38 with several clearly distinguishable bands . In general , all three lines contain p38 proteins that migrate more slowly than those derived from a control rat brain synaptosomal fraction . Discussion The development of TH - expressing brain tumors in transgenic mice carrying SV40 Tag directed by TH regulatory sequences demonstrates that the CNS catecholaminergic neurons are in - deed susceptible to the effects of Tag . This is in contrast to the results obtained with the glucagon enhancer directing expression of Tag to neurons in the brainstem ( Efrat et al . , 1988 ) . While Tag expression was detectable in specific brainstem neurons that are thought to be glucagon expressing , no tumors arose . In the same animals , Tag could be seen in the appropriate a - cells of the endocrine pancreas as early as embryonic day 10 when those cells are first detected ( Pictet and Rutter , 1972 ) . At this site , the oncogene continued to be expressed throughout adulthood , leading to the formation of overt tumors by 9 - l 2 months . Since Tag - expressing neurons in the CNS failed to proliferate , a pos - sible implication was that CNS neurons were not susceptible to the effects of an oncogene . Recent experiments with the GnRH promoter driving SV40 Tag have demonstrated that this is not the case for all neurons ( Mellon et al . , 1990 ) . Not only did the transgenic mice develop tumors , but the neuronal cell lines iso - lated from such tumors continued to produce both GnRH and Tag . While it is likely that glucagon expression in the CNS is restricted to postmitotic neurons , the GnRH - expressing hypo - thalamic neurons , which are thought to arise from the olfactory placode , have been shown to express the hormone while still dividing ( Schwanzel - Fukuda and Pfaff , 1989 ) . These results might suggest that Tag needs to be expressed in a dividing cell in order to initiate transformation . This explanation is not entirely con - sistent with results using a PNMT - Tag transgene ( Hammang et al . , 1990 ) . Retinal tumors were observed in these transgenic mice in amacrine cells that are thought to be postmitotic at the time when PNMT is first expressed . However , the cell type of origin for the amacrine cell cultures derived from these tumors is unclear since these cells did not produce PNMT . They also did not express other catecholaminergic properties , although the lack of TH and other catecholaminergic traits may be due to the fact that a significant percentage of PNMT - positive amacrine cells normally do not produce TH ( Hadjiconstantinou et al . , 1984 ; Park et al . , 1986 ) . Nevertheless , the lack of PNMT in cultured cells was surprising and was suggested by the authors to be due to a repression of the differentiated phenotype by Tag . Therefore , the issue as to whether a postmitotic neuron can be immortalized by the action of Tag remained unresolved in these experiments .

Our results clearly show that TH - producing CNS tumors can be obtained despite the fact that TH expression in the brain is observed only in postmitotic neurons in viva ( Specht et al . , 198 1 ) . One possibility for the success of the TH promoter may be due to the fact that TH is an early marker of differentiated catecholaminergic neurons . In the rat CNS , TH is first detected in cells at embryonic day 10 . 5 , within 1 d of the birth of these cells ( Foster et al . , 1985 ) . Thus , even though TH is expressed by postmitotic neurons , the presence of Tag so early in devel - opment might allow the cell to reenter the cell cycle while main - taining TH expression . In contrast , expression of Tag late in development , with the glucagon or PNMT promoter constructs , may be incapable of driving a neuron back into the cell cycle after it has been withdrawn from the cycle for a number of days . This differential susceptibility of a neuron to oncogenesis based on its developmental status could also account for the lack of tumors in some tissues and their presence in others . The observation that brain tumors only arose in adults and at various ages from 15 weeks to 8 . 5 months , but were always present in the same location in the brain even though Tag itself was present in other regions , implies two things : first , that Tag by itself is not sufficient to induce tumors in the brain , and second , that some cells in the midbrain or brainstem are more likely than others to undergo complete transformation . The observation that SV40 Tag requires additional transforming events in order to cause neoplasia is well estab - lished . The multistep process hypothesized for tumorigenesis ( Foulds , 1958 ) has been strongly supported by experiments with primary cells in tissue culture ( Land et al . , 1983 ; Yancopoulos et al . , 1985 ) and with transgenic mice in vivo ( Hanahan , 1985 ; Mahon et al . , 1987 ; Sinn et al . , 1987 ) . The lack of brain tumors with the glucagon - Tag transgene ( Efmt et al . , 1988 ) could be due to the smaller numbers of glucagon - positive cells as com - pared to the number of TH - positive cells . The small number of glucagon - positive cells would reduce the number of potential targets for subsequent “hits” needed for full transformation . The fact that TH - producing tumors always arose in the same location in the brain demonstrates that cells in this area are more prone to neoplasia . Possibly , Tag is expressed earlier in development in these susceptible cells . Alternatively , it may be that the TH - expressing cells of this region can transcribe Tag more efficiently because of the presence of appropriate trans - activating factors that would efficiently activate the TH pro - moter as compared to non - TH - expressing neurons in other brain 1288 Suri et al . * Catecholaminergic Cell Lines with the TH - SV40 Tag Transgene f - 4 . 0 kb f - 2 . 5 kb : 12345 Figure 6 .

Arrows mark the sizes of the two mRNA species of the light chain gene of NF . All lanes are from the same gel and blot . regions . This difference in Tag levels might account for the relative ease with which transformation is accomplished in TH - expressing cells . The absence of Tag staining in some TH - expressing tissues such as OB and SCG is likely to reflect the lack of appropriate tissue - specific elements in 773 bp of TH upstream region . A similar pattern of Tag expression was found in transgenic mice in which 2 . 8 kb of 5’ TH DNA was used ( C . Suri and D . M . Chikaraishi , unpublished observations ) . While these transgenic mice developed CNS tumors similar to the - 773 TH - Tag mice , they also failed to express Tag in the OB and SCG . Recently , Kaneda et al . ( 199 l ) , using the entire coding region ofthe human TH gene including 2 . 5 kb of 5’ flanking DNA and 0 . 5 kb of 3’ flanking DNA , demonstrated a strong expression in appropriate brain regions and adrenal glands as well as inappropriate ex - pression in CNS regions like the striatum and hippocampus . In fact , further in situ and immunohistochemical analyses extended the areas of ectopic expression in the CNS ( Nagatsu et al . , 199 1 ) . Unfortunately , expression in the OB and SCG was not reported in these studies . In contrast , a longer 5’ flanking region ( 4 . 8 kb ) of the rat TH gene appears to contain all the elements for correct tissue - specific expression in transgenic mice ( Banerjee et al . , 1992 ) . Creation of transgenic mice bearing the 4 . 8 TH - Tag construct was in fact attempted but only 1 of 47 pups carried the transgene and that one lineage was nonexpressing , suggesting Figure 7 . Presence of synaptophysin in the TH - Tag cell lines : im - munocytochemical staining in CATH . a ( a ) , PATH . 1 ( b ) , and PATH . 2 ( c ) . Scale bar , 20 pm . that the presence of the transgene may have had a deleterious effect on the development of the fetus ( Suri and Chikaraishi , unpublished observations ) . Several lines of evidence demonstrate that CATH . a , PATH . 1 , and PATH . 2 are noradrenergic . They synthesize active forms of the enzymes TH and DBH and produce the catecholamines DA and NE . The activities of the two enzymes are similar to those in the PC12 cell line . The activity of TH in PC12 cells , as initially reported , was 39 f 5 pmol / min / mg protein ( Greene and Tischler , 1976 ) which is 6 - 30 - fold less than in the TH - Tag lines . DBH , on the other hand , has an activity level of 806 + 84 pmol / min / mg protein in PC12 cells , which is approxi - mately five - to sevenfold more than in the TH - Tag lines . The levels of DA and NE in PC12 cells are 16 . 6 ? 1 . 7 and 6 . 1 + 6 nmol / mg protein , respectively , which are higher than in the TH - Tag lines . This may be because the TH - Tag lines secrete large amounts of catecholamines into the tissue culture medium . The presence of NFs , the intermediate filaments in neurons , The Journal of Neuroscience , March 1993 , 73 ( 3 ) 1289 1 12345 Figure 8 . Presence of synaptophysin in the TH - Tag cell lines : Western analysis with synaptophysin antibody . Each lane contains 67 fig of total protein from the following : NIH3T3 ( lane I ) , PATH . 1 ( lane 2 ) , PATH . 2 ( lane 3 ) , CATH . a ( lane 4 ) and a rat brain synaptosomal fraction ( he 5 ) . Bracketed region shows the position of synaptophysin from rat brain . and the absence of GFAP , characteristic of glial cells , imply that the TH - Tag cell lines are neuronal in origin . The presence of synaptophysin or p38 in the TH - Tag lines suggests the existence of synaptic vesicles , although the presence of vesicles needs to be confirmed by ultrastructural analysis . It is interesting that the apparent molecular weight of p38 in all three cell lines is higher than in the rat brain synaptosomal preparation . This may be due to different posttranslational modifications in the trans - formed cells , since other neuroendocrine tumors and neuroblas - tomas also exhibit these differences ( Weidenmann and Huttner , 1989 ) . Synaptophysin or p38 is an integral membrane protein with a molecular weight of 38 kDa . It is inserted in the membranes of small vesicles found only in neurons and neuroendocrine cells ( Navone et al . , 1986 ) . In neurons these vesicles have been shown to function as storage sites for non - peptidergic neurotransmit - ters and to participate in their regulated release via exocytosis . In endocrine cells the function of p38 - containing vesicles is not well understood ( Johnston et al . , 1989 ) . The pattern of staining for synaptophysin in our cells is very similar to that in PC12 cells , where the majority of staining has been shown to be cen - tered about the Golgi complex ( Johnston et al . , 1989 ) . If syn - aptophysin is incorporated into vesicles they may tend to pool near the Golgi complex , their site of synthesis . Since PATH and CATH . a lack neurites under normal culture conditions , they may lack the machinery necessary to transport vesicles to the periphery and hence accumulate more vesicles over the Golgi complex . The small cell size and the large nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio suggest that the three lines have originated from relatively im - mature cells . The PATH lines are likely to have arisen from precursors in the chromaffin lineage in the adrenal medulla . The lack of E is consistent with the immortalization of a precursor cell , since immature sympathoadrenal cells tend to be norad - renergic . The noradrenergic phenotype of CATH . a is consistent with an origin in the NE neurons ofthe brainstem mainly located in the locus coeruleus and lateral tegmental area . However , a more rigorous biochemical and physiological examination is required before the origin can be fully established , since it may be that some dopaminergic cells of the midbrain express NE transiently during development ( Choi et al . , 199 1 ) . It would be of interest to determine whether CATH . a bears receptors for GABA ( Cedarbaum and Aghajanian , 1976 ) 5 - HT ( Segal , 1979 ) , opiates ( Atweh and Kuhar , 1977 ) , and NE ( Aghajanian et al . , 1977 ) as has been demonstrated for locus coeruleus neurons . In conclusion , our results demonstrate that promoter directed oncogenesis in transgenic animals can be used to establish CNS cell lines from postmitotic neurons . Since our cell lines retain high levels of catecholamine expression , they should be useful for a variety of studies involving gene regulation and trans - plantation and should serve as good sources for the isolation of tissue - specific transcription factors .
