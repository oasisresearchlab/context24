Understanding these disparate responses has been insufficient , especially from a social recovery perspective . In this study , we propose the con - cept of social recovery and develop a comprehensive perspective on how a city ' s socioeconomic characteristics affect it . The analytical framework is applied to 296 prefecture - level cities in China , with social recovery measured by the changes in intercity intensity between the pre - pandemic baseline ( 2019 Q1 and Q2 ) and the period in which the pandemic slightly abated ( 2020 Q1 and Q2 ) through anonymized location - based big data . The results indicate that the social re - covery of Chinese cities during the COVID - 19 pandemic are significantly spatially correlated . Cities with larger populations , a higher proportion of GDP in the secondary industry , higher road density or more adequate medical resources tend to recover socially better . Moreover , these mu - nicipal characteristics have significant spatial spillover effects . Specifically , city size , government intervention and industrial structure show negative spillover effects on neighboring areas while information dissemination efficiency , road density , and the number of community health services per capita have positive spillover . This study fills the knowledge gap regarding the different per - formances of cities when they face pandemic shocks . The assessment of a city ' s social recovery is an insight into the theoretical framework of vulnerability that aids in translating it into urban re - silience . Hence our findings provide practice implications for China and beyond as the interest in urban - resilience development surges around the post - pandemic world . 1 . Introduction Since their formation , cities have been high aggregates of human socioeconomic activities and continuously subject to chronic pressures and acute external and internal shocks [ 1 ] . These risks or crises are highly uncertain and pose a significant threat to the eco - nomic development and social stability of countries . Once stricken by a shock , a city faces a wide range of operations to cope with losses to recover its diversified socioeconomic activities [ 2 ] . However , it is clear that cities recover at different rates and at different levels following risks , with some unable to recover and others gradually overcoming the adverse effects of risks and even using them as opportunities for further development [ 3 ] . Previous research has shown that generally , factors such as the level of economic devel - opment , industrial structure , city size , infrastructure , and health status may explain the recovery of cities after a crisis [ 4 – 7 ] . The recovery of a city infers the process by which it rebuilds and revitalizes itself following a traumatic event or a period of de - cline . This may include natural disasters , economic recessions , social unrest , or other events that disrupt the fabric of urban life [ 8 ] . * Correspondingauthor .

Yang et al . Unlike other shocks or disruptions , the novel coronavirus ( COVID - 19 ) , assessed by the United Nations as the biggest challenge facing the human race since World War II , affecting nearly every country and region , has triggered extensive scientific research from various perspectives [ 9 , 10 ] . This crisis is in extremis [ 11 ] , with many cities severely affected by the epidemic underwent phased lockdowns and business shutdowns , leading to widespread cases and extensive social and economic impacts in a short period of time , which se - verely challenged the extreme vulnerability of citizens to unexpected and complex global risks , and the ability of cities to heal against such severe shocks [ 12 , 13 ] . Recovering from the COVID - 19 pandemic remains one of the greatest concerns over the next few years [ 14 ] . Although much is known conceptually that municipal characteristics have large impacts on a city ' s ability to withstand the COVID - 19 outbreak [ 10 , 15 – 17 ] , there are limited studies that which specific characteristics explain the different responses of cities to such shock and how these characteristics manifest empirically during the social recovery process . Mainly , this is due to a lack of em - pirical data sets and analytical frameworks to measure social recovery in response to the pandemic in temporal and spatial detail , de - spite the fact that such information is critical for policymakers to improve social levels in city development [ 18 ] . Against this backdrop , this study attempts to identify and explore the spatial effects of the municipal socioeconomic characteris - tics that influence the social recovery of cities after the COVID - 19 shock . Based on previous research [ 19 – 21 ] , we define social recov - ery as the process of agents gradually resuming regular daily routines and ultimately returning to a stable state in accordance with their own social characteristics after the shock of a destructive force . Our study employed the recovery of population mobility as a proxy for social recovery since people are the most dynamic factor in socioeconomic systems [ 22 ] , their cross - regional movement and migration can promote the re - aggregation and diffusion of social and economic factors to some extent [ 23 ] , and the maintenance of urban dynamics requires constant drawing of external negative entropy ( influx of people , material and information ) [ 24 , 25 ] . Thus , the recovery of population mobility can serve as an important signal of economic and social recovery in the wake of the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 26 ] . Our study makes an important contribution to the existing literature and practices . First , we tapped into the potential of anonymized location - based data to construct a social recovery index at the city level , represented by percentage changes in intercity travel intensity during the pandemic . Second , we propose a comprehensive framework incorporating different factors influencing a city ' s social recovery and identify possible determinants . Finally , we introduce a spatial analysis paradigm to examine the impact of municipal characteristics on cities ' social recovery and its spillovers , which represents meaningful progress in research methodology . Since regional heterogeneity and spatial correlation are taken into account , the socio - economic characteristics of one region may have a specific impact on surrounding regions through diffusion or polarization because of spatial interactions , and ignoring spatial spillover effects 1 may lead to biased model estimates [ 27 ] . Our results provide significant practice evidence for a city ' s flexible devel - opment in the post - pandemic era . The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . The next section reviews the literature on this topic . We describe the model set - tings and the data in Section 3 . Section 4 provides empirical results and discussion . We finish the paper with suggestions for future re - search at the end . 2 . Literature review Since the turn of the century , cities worldwide have been struck by various diseases , including the avian flu , SARS , swine flu , Ebola , and the emerging COVID - 19 [ 28 ] . Serious problems have been associated with these shocks , generating interest in how to help cities prepare for and recover from extreme events [ 29 ] . Before the 1990s , disaster studies primarily conceptualized recovery as a pre - dictable sequential process composed of multiple stages that eventually led back to “ normalcy ” [ 30 ] . More recent conceptualizations acknowledge that individuals experience recovery at different rates and have different outcomes . Going beyond the reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure , recovery also includes the rebuilding of people ' s lives and livelihoods [ 31 ] , and clearly requires social and cultural recovery as well [ 32 ] . It is also important to note that recovery is a spatially and temporally dynamic process [ 33 ] . Most researchers have divided post - disaster recovery into three phases - relief , restoration , and recovery . Relief involves mitigating acute post - disaster conditions such as rescuing . Restoration is about bringing back infrastructures , while recovery includes returning organizations , communities , and envi - ronments to successful operations [ 34 ] . Further research suggests that the recovery process should include both physical and social recovery after a disaster [ 35 ] . [ 36 ] divided disaster recovery into four phases : emergency , restoration , basic reconstruction , and ma - jor constructions . Among them , the basic reconstruction phase includes rebuilding structures to pre - disaster levels , replacing the pop - ulation , and building a functioning society . Thus , recovery can be defined as the differential process of restoring , rebuilding , and re - shaping the physical , social , economic , and natural environment [ 37 ] . In this study , we focus on the municipal level of social recov - ery . While the majority of recovery studies have focused on reconstruction of the physical environment and economic indicators such as employment and income [ 8 , 31 , 38 ] , it is important not to neglect the social aspects of recovery . Initially by Ref . [ 21 ] ; social recov - ery encompasses economic and residential independence with low social disruption . 1 Spatialspillovereffect : alsocalledindirecteffectorneighborhoodeffect .

Inacer - tain spatial scope , changes in any variable will affect other spatial units , and the association and interdependence among elements are important factors that cause changes [ 118 ] . In regional economic development , the spatial spillover effect can be expressed as the impact of economic growth in one region on the economy of other regions , especially neighboring regions , is the impact of a certain economic activity on individuals in spatial proximity [ 119 ] . International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 90 ( 2023 ) 103643 3 T . Yang et al . Recovery also reflects the idiosyncrasies of the shocked area , with more vulnerable areas needing longer recovery phases [ 39 ] . So - cial vulnerability is generally defined as a set of pre - existing ( individual , household , or community ) conditions that hinder disaster preparedness , risk mitigation , and recovery capacity and disproportionately increase disaster damage and loss burden [ 40 ] . Based on the Hazard of Place ( HOP ) model and framework [ 41 , 42 ] , social vulnerability theories postulate that characteristics such as race and ethnicity , gender , income , poverty , age , education , and religion play significant individual or combined roles ( poor , minority , and women ) in where people live , access to social and economic resources , and , the overall ability to cope and recover from disaster im - pacts [ 43 ] . Assessment of urban recovery is an insight into the theoretical framework of vulnerability that aids in translating it into urban con - struction . Although several indices have been developed to measure vulnerability [ 44 – 48 ] , only relatively few studies have consid - ered recovery indices as well as only a few qualitative studies that have assessed perceptions of quality of life and general satisfaction with the recovery process [ 38 ] . It is increasingly acknowledged that recovery - process assessment should be based on indicators to guarantee objectivity and comparability [ 8 ] . Researchers have proposed recovery indices based on macroscopic statistics such as pop - ulation , railway passenger numbers , welfare , and crime rates [ 2 ] . Another method to measure recovery progress in an urban zone is based on targets . Organization of the recovery process after the Kobe earthquake ( Japan ) provides a model that measures the recov - ery progress based on three targets [ 32 ] . In studies on sustainable cities after the COVID − 19 epidemic , most existing work has focused on socioeconomic recovery . Popula - tion mobility associated with social relations has been widely used as an indicator of social recovery [ 3 , 26 , 31 , 49 ] . For example [ 26 ] , constructed indicators such as relative recovery index and recovery gap index based on population migration index data from January 13 to April 8 , 2020 , to reveal the day - by - day characteristics , stage characteristics , and spatial and temporal patterns of China ' s short - term impact from the COVID - 19 pandemic at multiple scales . Researchers investigating and analyzing actual cases [ 50 – 54 ] have identified factors affecting social recovery including population , health status , social services , community capacity , social networks , economic interactions , agricultural production methods , regional culture , and transportation [ 4 – 7 ] . Scholars who have examined the spread of COVID - 19 were quick to attribute it to density [ 16 ] , which renders it one of the most contentious and impactful factors and raises the question of whether urban density and healthy cities closely correlate . Others also began to explore the safety implications of city size after the SARS outbreak in 2002 , suggesting that excessive size is the primary reason for increasing risk level [ 55 ] . The scale of services , such as , socio - economic , environmental , and infrastructure , also affects urban recovery , according to Abdrabo et al . [ 56 ] . Specifically , city size affects it through economic growth and infrastructure development [ 57 ] . Post - disaster population displacement and recovery patterns on a city scale have long been studied through surveys and census data [ 3 , 15 , 58 – 61 ] . Although such studies have revealed factors associated with recovery , they have often neglected the effect of in - terdependencies between cities . New geolocation techniques offer the possibility of studying population movements and the possible spread of infectious diseases at an unprecedented , high spatio - temporal granularity [ 62 – 66 ] . Most recently , general patterns of popu - lation recovery have been studied through cross - comparative analyses using large - scale mobile phone GPS data sets from multiple crises [ 67 , 68 ] . Moreover , heterogeneity in displacement rates has been explained by a set of key universal factors across various com - munities and includes median income level , population size , housing damage rate , and connectivity to other regions . Despite such progress , the importance of the association of municipal characteristics in relation to social recovery has been under - studied in the lit - erature . Notably , some researchers have used spatial indicators to measure the recovery progress in affected areas [ 31 , 69 ] , demon - strating that indices are also useful in measuring the spatial components of recovery . However , these components have received lim - ited coverage in the literature to date . Spatial correlations are evident measurements of stages reached in the recovery process , mak - ing it easier to design a recovery plan during the early stages and subsequent progress evaluations . Recording temporal and spatial information is known as location - based services ( LBS ) big data [ 70 ] , and the scale of data is signif - icant and includes comprehensive geographical coverage . Currently , LBS big data plays a key role in COVID - 19 scientific research and control practices [ 71 ] . used massive , anonymized population - movement data and daily - travel network simulations to prove that the combination of non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPI ) such as travel restriction and contact reduction in China achieved rapid out - break control . However , LBS big data are mostly used for epidemic predictions , real - time statistics , and trajectory identification [ 26 ] , and little research has been conducted on social recovery assessment . Taken together , some urban social - recovery research has been conducted , but it has focused on the recovery conception from a broader perspective . Although recovery indices have been developed , no consensus has been reached on a quantitative approach to evaluate urban social recovery . This research has often ignored the role of interdependence among cities and failed to adequately match China ' s context [ 72 , 73 ] . Although such interdependence is importance for both scholars and government , few empirical stud - ies have addressed this issue . Therefore , in this study , we measure the social recovery of Chinese cities using large data on Baidu mi - gration in cities across the country . We also examine the impact of municipal characteristics on cities ' social recovery and their spatial spillover effects . It is expected that this study will offer important suggestions for the formulation of urban resilience policy . 3 . Methodology and data 3 . 1 . Data collection and description This case study selected Chinese cities based on the following reasons . First , the first confirmed COVID - 19 cases were identified in late 2019 in Wuhan , Hubei Province , China [ 74 ] , and unlike other affected countries , Chinese cities adopted a series of commendable practices during the early outbreak stages , such as restrictng population mobility and crowd gathering by setting up traffic choke - points and quarantine stations on city streets , village roads and towns , which promptly curbed the spread of the epidemic [ 75 ] . How - ever , post - disaster social recovery faces challenges because of cities ’ socio - economic characteristics and control policies such as travel International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 90 ( 2023 ) 103643 4 T . Yang et al . restrictions . Second , as the largest developing country in the world , China has become an important microcosm of urbanization worldwide [ 76 ] . COVID - 19 has been a critical public health emergency in China and has dramatically impacted the national social - economic development . It is possible to enhance the social recovery capacity of cities under an epidemic norm by replacing “ short - term pain relief ” with “ long - term pain management ” and systematically sustaining city operations over the long term . Therefore , our scenarios offer a new research perspective for China , which is in the process of continuous urbanization and an industrialization boom . We used multiple sources of data in this study . After excluding some regions with missing data , like Hong Kong , Macau , and Tai - wan , we arrived at a panel of data for 296 cities at the prefectural level or higher in 31 provinces ( districts ) in China . As of February 15 , 2020 , most provinces and cities in China such as Shanghai , Chongqing , Xi ' an , and Hubei Province , started to resume production and work . 2 To reflect the study dynamics , the data time series was set as February 15 , 2020 to May 5 , 2020 , with a total of 81 days . However , to reveal the socioeconomic impact of the epidemic and ensure comparability , the historical data for the same period in the 2019 lunar calendar were selected from February 26 , 2019 to May 17 , 2019 . First , based on previous studies on urban social recovery [ 3 , 26 , 31 , 49 ] , the population mobility recovery was used as a proxy for social recovery , and the social recovery index ( SRI ) was constructed and used as the explained variable for this study [ 77 – 79 ] . SRI i , t = ITI i , t ∕ ITI i , t ′ ( 1 ) where SRI i , t is the social recovery index of city i at time t , ITI i , t shows the intercity travel intensity of city i at time t , and ITI i , t ’ shows the intercity travel intensity of city i for the same time t ' in lunar calendar 2019 . We measured the intercity travel index ( ITI ) as the sum of the in - migration index and the out - migration index [ 80 ] , which was crawled using Python from the Baidu migration data . The Baidu migration data were acquired from Baidu Map , 3 which defines and mines migrating people by identifying the spatial and temporal displacement of a large number of LBS service users , and determines the migration characteristics of people between regions [ 77 ] , and can be used to compare the scale and spatial distribution of popula - tion mobility in different regions at different times . The Baidu migration data provides in - migration , out - migration and within - city migration index recorded at the provincial and city levels in China on a daily basis , as well as the proportion of in - migration and out - migration populations by province and city of origin . The in - migration and out - migration indexes we use record the number of people moving between any two cities and directly reflect the intercity population movement in China [ 26 ] . Although it cannot capture all migrants as it is based on the availability of smartphones , it is useful for comparing general migration patterns among different cities . The significant dates of COVID - 19 impacts and mitigation processes in China can be seen in Fig . 1 . Academician Zhong Nanshan , on January 20 , 2020 stated that there existed a “ human - to - human ” transmission phenomenon in COVID - 19 . On the same day , Gen - eral Secretary Xi Jinping requested Party committees and all levels of government as well as relevant departments to take effective measures . Subsequently , following the “ city closure ” of Wuhan on January 23rd for epidemic prevention and control , 31 provinces , municipalities and autonomous regions across the country entered a public health event level 1 response as of January 30 , 2020 , and China began to enter a national phase of population mobility control [ 81 ] . By early February 2020 , the spread of the epidemic had been initially contained , with most provinces and cities having no new confirmed cases for several days and starting to resume work in batches . For example , enterprises in Wuxi started to resume work on February 9 , Guangdong Province , Zhejiang Province , Hebei Province , Henan Province , Heilongjiang Province , Shanghai , Chongqing on February10 . 4 On February 14 , 2020 , Hubei Province , which was most severely affected by the COVID - 19 outbreak , resumed operations . 5 and according to Ref . [ 26 ] ; most cities entered a rapid recovery period by that time , and a smooth recovery period began on March 3 . Intercity population movement increased in Wuhan City on April 8 when control measures for the passage away from Han and away from Hubei . On May 2 , all 31 Chinese provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities lifted their Level 1 responses to the public health emergency , and the epidemic control achieved a stage victory [ 82 ] . Therefore , considering the time lag required for policy implementation , we selected SRI data for the next day of each node — i . e . , February 15 , 2020 ; March 4 , 2020 ; April 9 , 2020 ; and May 3 , 2020 , respectively , which represent different recovery stages in 296 Chinese cities . Fig . 2 depicts the map of SRI classification symbols divided into 6 grades . As shown in Fig . 2 , COVID - 19 dramatically changed the social recovery of Chinese cities , and the SRI and the degree of change varied significantly across cities . Fig . 2 ( a ) shows that after the basic resumption of production and work nationwide , the SRIs of most cities across the country were at Grade 1 and 2 , with only a few eastern coastal cities reaching Grade 3 above 0 . 6 , implying that the impact of the outbreak and implementation of strong preventive and control measures in the early stages contributed to increasing awareness regarding the seriousness of the virus . Resumption of work and production in such cities was also greatly affected after the holidays . After effectively controlling the outbreak by March 4 , the SRI remained at Grades 1 and 2 in most cities ; however , the num - ber of cities that reached Grade 3 increased significantly , and some southern cities reached Grades 4 and 5 ( Fig . 2 ( b ) ) . According to Fig . 2 ( c ) , after Wuhan was unsealed , the number of cities in Grades 1 and 2 decreased significantly , and most cities reached Grade 3 . Still , there were a few cities in Grades 4 and 5 , and the SRI was more evenly distributed among cities nationwide .

Map of SRI classification symbols for 296 cities in China . provement of the epidemic and the relaxation of preventive and control measures , the SRI in most cities across the country was greater than Grade 4 ( 0 . 9 ) . This was true especially in some eastern and southern cities , which reached Grades 5 and 6 ( Fig . 2 ( d ) ) , and normalcy was reestablished . Second , although the specific dates of issuing prevention and control and return - to - work policies varies across the country , pro - duction and daily life had largely begun to recover as of February 15 . A range of explanatory variables was selected to assess the im - pacts of municipal characteristics on social resilience . Social recovery is closely associated with a city ' s macroeconomic conditions , with more economically developed cities better able to mobilize more frequent population flow and improve social resilience [ 83 ] . Therefore , in this study , we selected macro - economic characteristics such as city size ( the total population at the end of the year ) , gov - ernment intervention ( government public budget expenditure per capita ) , and industrial structure ( the proportion of primary , sec - ondary , and tertiary industries in the GDP ) [ 84 , 85 ] . As social recovery is also closely related to infrastructure development in each city [ 53 , 86 ] , we chose information dissemination efficiency ( the number of internet users ) and road density ( the ratio of total high - way length to land area per capita ) as criteria . Similarly , the level of medical care in each city had a direct impact on population flow International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 90 ( 2023 ) 103643 6 T . Yang et al . during the epidemic [ 18 ] , and thus we chose the number of community health - service institutions per capita and the number of med - ical beds per capita [ 84 ] . Additionally , the number of newly confirmed cases was also controlled . Considering that the intercity travel intensity is the ratio between 2020 and 2019 , and that it was daily data so that the city macro situation was not likely to change signif - icantly during the study period , the characteristic indicators of each city in 2018 , a close sample year , were uniformly adopted as vari - ables . The number of community health - service institutions was obtained by the Statistical Bulletins or Statistical Yearbooks 6 of 296 cities , and missing data were supplemented by the government or health commission websites 7 ; the number of newly confirmed cases was derived from the accumulated number of confirmed COVID - 19 cases published by the health commissions of each city , which were differentiated to obtain newly confirmed daily cases . Additionally , the 2018 China City Statistical Yearbook 8 provided data on the total population at year end , government public budget spending , the proportion of primary , secondary , and tertiary industries in the GDP , the number of internet users , the total highway length , regional land area , and the number of medical beds . All of these vari - ables were used in the spatial model after taking logarithms . In our empirical study , there were 23 , 976 observations . Table 1 de - scribes the basic statistical description of the main variables . 3 . 2 . Model specifications Spatial autocorrelation is an analytical method that tests whether the observed values at a point in space are correlated with the values at its neighboring points [ 87 – 89 ] . If the value of a variable at a location is high , the value of that variable at its nearby location is also high , then it is positive spatial correlation ; conversely , it is negative spatial correlation . In recent years , scholars have used Moran ' s I , Geary C index , and Getis - Ord index G to test spatial correlation , among which Moran ' s I is the most widely used [ 90 ] . An in - vestigation of the spatial correlation existence of cities ' social recovery is conducted in this study using Moran ' s I : I = n ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 Wij ( Xi −  X ) ( Xj −  X ) S 2 n ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 Wij ( 2 ) where S 2 = n ∑ i = 1 ( Xi − X ) 2 n  X = n ∑ i = 1 Xi n , I takes values in the range of [ − 1 , 1 ] , and the larger the Moran ' s I value , the higher spatial correlation is indicated . Here , I > 0 indicates a positive spatial correlation , while I < 0 indicates a negative spatial correlation , and I = 0 indicates no correlation — that is , the spatial distribution is random . On the subject of the impacts of municipal characteristics , most of the previous studies were conducted within the ordinary least squares ( OLS ) model [ 91 – 93 ] . Therefore , the basic panel data model for the impact of municipal characteristics on cities ’ social recov - ery is presented below : Yi , t = 𝛽 Xi , t + 𝜀 i , t ( 3 ) where explained variable Y represents coefficient of cities ' social recovery , i is the region , t is the date , explanatory variable X is the characteristic variables of macro , infrastructure , and medical care . β denotes the estimated coefficient of explanatory variable X , and ε it denotes the error term . To empirically analyze the influence of these factors on cities ’ social recovery through spatial spillover effects , a spatial panel - data regression model using a spatial weight matrix is constructed based on Model ( 2 ) , including the spatial autocorrelation model ( SAR ) and spatial error model ( SEM ) [ 94 ] , and the spatial Durbin model ( SDM ) [ 95 ] , which is as follows : Yi , t = 𝜌 WYi , t + 𝛽 Xi , t + 𝛼𝜄 n + 𝜃 WXi , t + 𝜇 i + ui , t ui , t = λ W 𝜇 i , t + 𝜀 i , t ( 4 ) where ρ and λ both represent the spatial autocorrelation coefficient , and W represents the spatial weight matrix , WY refers to the de - gree of interdependence and correlation of local social recovery and other cities . WX is the exogenous interaction of local municipal characteristics and other cities , τ n means a vector of n * 1 ; α , β , and θ represent the vectors of regression coefficient estimates ; while μ refers to the vector of a fixed or random effect , and u i , t denotes the spatial error term . Equation ( 4 ) can be simplified into three different models with the appropriate constraints : When λ = 0 , it is simplified to SDM ; when θ = 0 and λ = 0 , it is simplified to a spatial lag model or a spatial autoregressive model ; and as θ = 0 and ρ = 0 , it is simplified to SEM . According to Ref . [ 96 ] ; when the LM test rejects the OLS model , there is a spatial lag and spatial error , making SDM more ap - propriate . The SDM can be interpreted as a SAR or SEM model in a restricted form with spatial lags for both the dependent variables ( WY ) and the explanatory variables ( WX ) . 6 TheinformationisfromtheStatisticalBureausofeachcity , forexample , dataforBeijingcanbefoundonlineathttps : / / nj . tjj . beijing . gov . cn / nj / main / 2019 - tjnj / zk / indexch . htm . 7 Sincethedatasourceinvolves296citiesandeachcityhasadifferentsource , Beijingisusedhereasanexample .

( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , the main empirical model for estimating the spatial spillover effects of municipal characteristics is configured as : Yi , t = 𝜌 N ∑ j = 1 WijYj , t + 𝛽 Xi , t + 𝜃 N ∑ j = 1 WijXj , t + 𝛼𝜄 n + 𝜇 i + ui , t ( 5 ) where j denotes the neighboring cities ( j ≠ i ) , and other variables are defined as previously stated . The spatial - weight matrix W measures the closeness of spatial linkages between variables on a regional basis . This study uses a spatial adjacency matrix ( W bin ) in constructing the spatial weighted matrix ( W ij ) , assuming that only neighboring cities influence each other : W ij = { 1 0 i ≠ j i = j and ∑ Nj Wij = 1 . In the case of W bin , a symmetric spatial matrix of 296 Chinese cities is shown in Fig . 3 . [ 95 ] provided a theoretical framework to better evaluate spatial spillover effects that requires decomposing the explanatory - variable effects on the explained variable ( social recovery index ) through converting the spatial weight matrix and accounting for the role of diagonal elements due to spatial correlation between variables . We calculated the direct , indirect , and total effects using the Fig . 3 . Symmetric spatial matrix of 296 Chinese cities . International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 90 ( 2023 ) 103643 8 T . Yang et al . SDM . These interventions reflect the cumulative effect of such independent - variable interventions ( municipal characteristics ) across Chinese cities , leading to changes in the long - term stationary balance [ 97 ] . The SDM is rewritten as : ( In − 𝜌 W ) y = X 𝛽 + WX 𝜃 + 𝛼𝜄 n + 𝜀 ( 6 ) y = k ∑ r = 1 Sr ( W ) xr + V ( W ) 𝛼𝜄 n + V ( W ) 𝜀 ( 7 ) where V ( W ) = ( In − ρ W ) − 1 and Sr ( W ) = V ( W ) ( In β r + W θ r ) . I n is a unit matrix of n * n , β r is the regression coefficient of the independent variable on the dependent variable , and θ r is the regression coefficient of the spatial lag term of the independent variable on the de - pendent variable . S r ( W ) is the matrix after these transformations . Expanding Eq . ( 7 ) from one region to n regions and converting it to matrix form , we obtain : y 1 y 2 ··· y 3 = k ∑ r = 1 ⎡⎢⎢⎢ ⎢ ⎢⎣ Sr ( W ) 11 Sr ( W ) 12 ··· Sr ( W ) 1 n Sr ( W ) 21 Sr ( W ) 22 ··· Sr ( W ) 2 n . . . . . . . . . . . .

Averaging the sum of the rows ( or columns ) of matrix S r ( W ) overall cities provides the average total effects , and the average indirect effects ( spillover effects ) are ob - tained by the difference between the total and direct effects . It can be shown as 9 :  M ( r ) total = n − 1 𝜄 ′ nS r ( W ) 𝜄 n  M ( r ) direct = n − 1 tr ( Sr ( W ) )  M ( r ) indirect =  M ( r ) total −  M ( r ) direct Thus , the explanatory - variable effects on the explained variable ( social recovery index ) can be divided into three categories . First is the direct effect , which examines the extent to which social recovery is influenced by the local explanatory variable , namely the ele - ments in the main diagonal of the matrix S r ( W ) . Second , the indirect effect ( or spatial spillover effect ) , which analyzes the extent to which social recovery is influenced as a result of the corresponding explanatory variables in adjacent spatial units ( corresponding to elements on the non - principal diagonal of the matrix S r ( W ) ) . Third , the total effect , which analyzes the extent to which social recov - ery is influenced by an explanatory variable in aggregate across all cities . 4 . Results and discussion 4 . 1 . Spatial autocorrelation test Based on the results of Moran ' s I index , 10 representative six - day SRI data were selected to obtain a Moran ' s I scatter plot of the so - cial recovery index for each city , as shown in Fig . 4 . According to Fig . 4 , the SRIs of 296 cities in China passed the significance test ( 1 % significance level ) during the observation pe - riod , indicating a significant positive spatial correlation among Chinese cities in terms of social recovery , as well as a certain mutual promotion relationship between the social recovery of each region . It can also be seen that the Moran ' s value is the largest ( 0 . 71478 ) on April 26th of these 6 days , and the social recovery of the city is gradually positive . In the following section , we analyze the spatial effects and differences in municipal characteristics that affect social recovery based on the development of a spatial econometric model . 4 . 2 . Empirical findings In this study , the impact and spatial effects of municipal characteristics on social recovery were estimated using the spatial econo - metric toolbox from Refs . [ 95 , 96 ] . We separately estimated OLS , SAR , SEM , and SDM models for 296 cities using spatial panel - data techniques after standardizing all variables . The results of the LM test and robust LM test show that spatial effects exist in the basic model , and that ordinary OLS estimators without spatial considerations are biased and overestimated . Results of the Wald test ( p = 0 . 00 ) both reject the null hypothesis that SAR and SEM are in favor of the SDM . Therefore , to examine the direct and indirect ( spillover ) effects of municipal characteristics on social recovery , we selected the SDM . The value of the Hausman test is 1703 . 70 ( de - grees of freedom = 12 , p = 0 . 00 ) , indicating the SDM should be preferred to the fixed effect model . After comparing the results of the space - fixed effect , the time - fixed effect , and the time and space double - fixed effects , the SDM time - fixed effect model was selected for this study , and the results are reflected in Table 2 . 9 To address the endogeneity problem in the model , we apply maximum likehood ( ML ) procedures to estimate spatial panel data models [ 97 ] . While generalized method of moments ( GMMs ) procedures are available as an alternate method , GMMs must generally contain independent variables with spatial lags — a condition does not allow for exploring the effect of spatial spillovers effects [ 120 ] . 10 Forbrevity , weonlyprovidethefinalresults .

As shown by the results , the spatial - autocorrelation coefficient ρ ( or spatial error coefficient λ ) is positive and significant in all models , which reveals that the 296 cities have positive and significant spatial - correlation levels with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 . 65 to 0 . 79 . The spatial adjacency matrix - based spatial econometric model is a better fit , and the estimation results of the SDM model differ somewhat from those of the SAR and SEM models after taking the spatially lagged terms of the explanatory variables into account . The coefficient of the spatial lag term expresses the extent of the explanatory - variable correlation in space , and it can also be International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 90 ( 2023 ) 103643 10 T . Yang et al . interpreted as the weighted influence of other cities on social recovery . Ultimately , the SDM time - fixed effect model was selected for the focused analysis . The regression coefficients of the explanatory variables indicate that city size , scale of primary industry , scale of secondary industry , information dissemination efficiency , road density and number of community health - service institutions per capita are deciding factors ( basically at the 1 % level of significance in all models ) . Regression coefficients are 0 . 088 , 0 . 086 , and 0 . 029 for city size , scale of primary industry , and scale of secondary industry , indi - cating significant positive effects on social recovery . The scale of tertiary industry is not significant . The regression coefficient of per capita government expenditure ( 0 . 011 ) is significantly positive at the 5 % level , indicating that governments with more actively man - aged finances can better facilitate intercity population mobility and improve social recovery . The regression coefficient of information dissemination efficiency is − 0 . 113 , showing that higher information - dissemination effi - ciency under the shock of COVID - 19 significantly reduces population mobility and negatively affects social recovery . The regression coefficient of road density is 0 . 064 , suggesting a significant positive effect on social recovery , and that ease of access promotes popu - lation mobility . The regression coefficients of the number of community health - service institutions per capita and the number of medical beds per capita ( 0 . 053 and 0 . 012 ) are both positive , indicating that the construction of community health services and the improvement of medical conditions contributed to social recovery under the shock of COVID - 19 . In addition , the regression coefficient of the control variable of the number of newly confirmed cases is not significant , indicating that the increase in the number of newly confirmed cases had no significant effect on local social recovery during the recovery phase . For further exploration of the interaction information contained in the coefficients of the regressions in the spatial econometric model , the exact signs and magnitudes of the direct and indirect effects of all explanatory variables in the SDM time - fixed model are reported in Table 3 . Although there is a significant positive direct effect of city size ( 0 . 082 ) , the indirect effect is significantly negative ( − 0 . 071 ) , and the total effect is insignificant , indicating that the expansion of city size can promote local social recovery while weakening the social recovery of neighboring cities . Both the direct and total effect of government expenditure per capita are significantly positive ( coef . = 0 . 027 , 0 . 225 ) , while the indirect effect is insignificant . This suggests that after considering the spatial spillover effects of all explanatory variables together , increasing government fiscal expenditure has a greater positive effect on improving the local social re - covery but no significant effect on neighboring cities . In terms of industrial structure , the direct effects of the scale of the primary and secondary industries are significantly positive ( coef . = 0 . 057 , 0 . 015 ) , whereas the indirect effects and total effects are significantly negative ( coef . = − 0 . 349 , − 0 . 160 ) , and ( coef . = − 0 . 292 , − 0 . 145 ) , respectively . On the other hand , the direct effect and total effect of the scale of tertiary industry on social recovery have significant positive effects ( coef . = 0 . 025 , 0 . 390 ) , while the indirect effect is insignificant . This suggests that an increase in the industrial structure significantly contributes to a higher local social recovery , ex - cept for an insignificant spillover effect of the tertiary sector on neighboring cities , which significantly weakens their social recovery . For infrastructure , the direct effect of information dissemination efficiency on social recovery is significantly negative ( coef . = - 0 . 101 ) . In contrast , the indirect and total effects are significantly positive ( coef . = 0 . 142 , 0 . 041 ) , indicating that enhancing informa - tion dissemination efficiency can significantly inhibit population flows during the epidemic , weakening local social recovery and cre - ating a significant promotion in neighboring cities . At the same time , the direct , indirect , and total effects of road density appear to be significantly positive ( coef . = 0 . 084 , 0 . 242 , 0 . 326 ) , indicating that an increase in road density contributes significantly both to the social recovery of local and neighboring cities , and that its spillover effect on neighboring cities is greater than its direct effect on the region . Note that the direct effect ( 0 . 084 , 18 ) is larger than the regression coefficient ( 0 . 064 , 17 ) , as the effect includes the “ feedback effect " . 11 Regarding medical care , significant positive direct , indirect , and total effects are found for the number of community health ser - vice institutions per capita ( coef . = 0 . 067 , 0 . 169 , 0 . 236 ) . The results suggest that increasing the number of community health service institutions per capita can significantly contribute to the social recovery of the local and surrounding cities . The direct effect of the number of medical beds per capita is insignificant , while the indirect effect is − 0 . 144 , which is significantly negative , and the total ef - fect is significantly positive at 0 . 049 . This indicates that increasing the number of medical beds per capita does not have a significant effect on local social recovery , although it has a significant weakening effect on the surrounding cities . Additionally , the direct , indi - rect , and total effects of the number of newly confirmed cases are all significantly negative ( coef . = − 0 . 145 , − 1 . 540 , − 1 . 685 , respec - tively ) , implying that increasing the number of newly confirmed cases significantly reduces both local and neighboring cities ' social recovery . 4 . 3 . Discussion It can be observed from our results that expansion of city size can promote the social recovery of the city itself , in accordance with previous research findings [ 51 , 56 , 98 – 100 ] that have shown that smaller cities have limited economic , social , institutional , and physi - cal resources , which makes them more vulnerable than larger cities [ 98 ] . Applied to this study , large cities have better resources that can directly facilitate or indirectly attract population mobility [ 100 ] . Despite having large populations at risk , large cities can more readily address disasters due to the abovementioned resource advantages [ 99 ] , reflecting an unequal distribution of social resources . The advantage of large cities also provides an explanation for the results of spillover effects , in which the social recovery of a city is in - fluenced by the size of the neighboring city in which the larger the neighboring city ( in the context of an epidemic shock ) , the more it attracts population mobility and the less intense the local population mobility .

Thus , our results remind us of the im - portance of balancing resource allocation and promoting coordinated regional development to expand urbanization . Government intervention positively affects local social recovery , which provides empirical evidence for [ 102 ] who argued that welfare spending shows a significant positive relationship with population migration . The outbreak of COVID - 19 made us aware of the importance of government expenditure in terms of city development , particularly in infrastructure investments such as medical research and medical care [ 73 ] . Government expenditure measures the capacity of the government to engage in resource mobiliza - tion [ 72 ] , and cities with greater government capacity to mobilize resources can devote more social resources to epidemic prevention and control while quickening post - disaster resumption of production and work to encourage intercity population mobility . However , social recovery in one city will not be influenced by government expenditure in neighboring cities , as each city government involves specific decisions tailored to the local context . Although neighboring cities may move to mimic each other ' s policy measures [ 103 ] , the impact of the local city ' s social recovery has little impact . Governments can mitigate the harm caused by disasters and promoting social recovery through the extent that regional public expenditure affects population migration and by adopting appropriate regula - tory measures in conjunction with regional policy goals . Industrial structure positively and significantly affects the social recovery of a city while weakening its neighboring cities , in agreement with what [ 52 , 104 ] have found . Primary and secondary industries have greater impacts on the improvement of local social recovery . An increase in the primary sector leads to promoting intercity population mobility . The agriculture , forestry , animal hus - bandry , and fishery industries are classified as primary industries in China , as these sectors are unable to provide a large amount of la - bor or even absorb surplus local labor in the context of mechanization , leading to population outflow [ 105 ] . In contrast , with the rapid development of secondary and tertiary industries , cities can provide a large number of jobs and thus absorb labor from sur - rounding and distant areas , while the population inflow from the surrounding cities will be reduced and social recovery weakened . Therefore , the endogenous development capacity of social recovery can be enhanced by industrial restructuring , transformation and upgrading , and accelerating the development of secondary and tertiary industries . In terms of infrastructure , information dissemination efficiency has a negative impact on local social recovery while promoting it in neighboring cities , which aligns with the study of Orencio et al . [ 86 ] . The result also reflects the specificity of our study conducted in the context of COVID - 19 , demonstrating the importance of timely and accurate publication of information crucial for epidemic pre - vention and control . Under conditions of persistent epidemics [ 84 ] , slow reporting , concealment , and omission of information would likely delay timing controlling the epidemics and expand its scale . Residents would take the epidemic more seriously with timely and accurate information , thus enhancing prevention and controlling literacy [ 106 ] Thus , intercity population mobility would be weak - ened , but the increase in the efficiency of information dissemination in neighboring cities would accelerate local social recovery . Even though information dissemination efficiency is an important factor affecting social recovery , it is not a positive factor for local urban governance and development in the context of our study . Road density significantly and positively affects the social recovery of both local and neighboring cities , and its spillover effect far outweighs the direct local effect . Roads are seen as the main lifeline of a region and are key components of the infrastructure in miti - gating and responding to emergencies . From a disaster management perspective , the development of trunk arterials can increase the flow of people and cargo [ 107 ] , thus contributing to the recovery of social vitality . Therefore , Chinese urban governments can priori - tize the development of infrastructure such as roads and expand transportation networks , which not only facilitate post - disaster re - covery , but also provide timely public services such as materials and people in order to withstand disasters , thus reducing losses . As for medical care [ 108 ] , showed that when a city has better healthcare resource adequacy , a city can contain the spread of an epidemic in significantly reduced time . Thus , improving medical conditions can effectively curb the spread of an epidemic [ 84 ] , thereby facilitating population mobility . Our empirical results show that an increase in community health services has a positive ef - fect on social recovery in both local and neighboring cities , providing strong evidence of the importance of medical resources in miti - gating the risk of epidemic transmission [ 81 , 109 ] . In terms of spillover effects , inadequate healthcare infrastructure and governance capacity may also increase the vulnerability of neighboring cities to cope with infectious disease [ 110 ] . However , an increase in the daily number of newly confirmed cases would directly reduce local population mobility , which translates to an increase in the overall COVID - 19 situation , leading to a subsequent decrease in social recovery in neighboring cities . This will cause a subsequent reduction in the social recovery of neighboring cities , which is consistent with the findings in the current literature on the relationship between International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 90 ( 2023 ) 103643 12 T . Yang et al . COVID - 19 and population mobility [ 18 , 79 , 111 ] . Thus , avoiding a healthcare system collapse can prevent more disease cases and eco - nomic losses [ 112 ] , and thus improve social recovery . 5 . Conclusion The lessons from the COVID - 19 pandemic have highlighted the importance of understanding what determines social recovery in a city , calling for developing empirical evidence to enhance a city ' s ability to cope with risk in the post - pandemic era . Based on munici - pal - level Baidu Migration Data , we constructed a social recovery index that compares intercity travel intensity during the light pan - demic remission ( 2020 Q1 and Q2 ) with the baseline ( 2019 Q1 and Q2 ) . Through a spatial analysis , the impacts of municipal charac - teristics on social recovery and their spillover effects in 296 cities have been identified . Our empirical findings indicate that the social recovery of Chinese cities is significantly spatially correlated , and cities ' municipal characteristics have significant impacts on social recovery . However , the spillover effects of municipal characteristics vary depending on their type . Our results complement the cur - rent framework of urban recovery that focuses primarily on environmental , socioeconomic , or natural disaster recovery . The specific findings are as follows . First , city size , scale of primary industry , scale of secondary industry , information dissemination efficiency , road density , and the number of community health - service institutions per capita were found to be the deciding factors in a city ' s social recovery . For in - stance , cities with larger populations , a higher proportion of GDP in the secondary industry , higher road density , or better medical re - sources tend to recover socially better . Second , the macroeconomic characteristics generally show positive effects on local social re - covery and negative spillover effects on neighboring areas . Third , although information dissemination efficiency and road density have different effects on local social recovery , these infrastructure characteristics both have positive spillover effects on neighboring areas . Fourth , the number of community health service institutions per capita has a positive effect on social recovery in both local and neighboring cities . Although our analysis is based on the case of Chinese cities shocked by COVID - 19 , the research framework has general applicabil - ity for understanding social recovery of cities in other countries after being shocked by COVID - 19 or other epidemics . For example , countries such as Germany , Italy , Spain , and France all severely restricted population mobility during the COVID - 19 pandemic and fo - cused on social recovery development in their countries after COVID - 19 abated [ 113 – 116 ] . Limitations still exist , however , and will impact future research agendas . First , a more comprehensive understanding of the urban recovery framework is needed , particularly to re - evaluate factors . The use of sources of big data , such as public transport check - in data , would allow for such an extension of the study . Second , this research only covered a relatively short study period because the employed dataset ( i . e . , Baidu Migration Index ) was updated for 2020 as of May 5th , when Chinese cities had not yet fully recovered . A longer time span can be analyzed in future if such a dataset becomes available . Third , the municipal characteristics and population mobility data used in this study include the whole city , not just the city center , which may have a Modifiable Areal Unit Problem ( MAUP ) and thus affect the analysis results . Future studies should focus on data screening and give full consideration to the scale and resolution of spatial data . Further , there is a limitation to use the recovery of population mobility as a symbol of social recovery , as so - cial recovery under the impact of a pandemic is a large - scale process , and the main factors affecting urban resilience may differ de - pending on event shocks and the passage of time . Therefore , future studies should try to add more variables from different perspec - tives to analyze issues related to urban resilience in a multidimensional way .
