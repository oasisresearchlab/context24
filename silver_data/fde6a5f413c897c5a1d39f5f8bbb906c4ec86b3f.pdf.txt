( Dated : September 1 , 2018 ) A broad range of membrane proteins display anomalous diﬀusion on the cell surface . Diﬀerent methods provide evidence for obstructed subdiﬀusion and diﬀusion on a fractal space , but the underlying structure inducing anomalous diﬀusion has never been visualized due to experimental challenges . We addressed this problem by imaging the cortical actin at high resolution while simultaneously tracking individual membrane proteins in live mammalian cells . Our data conﬁrm that actin introduces barriers leading to compartmen - talization of the plasma membrane and that membrane proteins are transiently conﬁned within actin fences . Furthermore , superresolution imaging shows that the cortical actin is organized into a self - similar meshwork . These results present a hierarchical nanoscale picture of the plasma membrane .

INTRODUCTION The plasma membrane is a complex ﬂuid where lipids and proteins continuously interact and generate signaling platforms in order to communicate with the outside world . One of the key mechanisms by which membrane molecules search reaction sites is based on lateral diﬀusion . Quantitative imaging methods , such as single - particle tracking [ 1 – 4 ] , spatiotemporal image correlation spectroscopy [ 5 ] , ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) [ 6 , 7 ] , and STED - FCS [ 8 , 9 ] , show that the dynamics of proteins and lipids in the plasma membrane often deviate from normal diﬀusion . In par - ticular , the mean square displacement ( MSD ) does not grow linearly in time as expected for Brownian motion [ 10 – 13 ] . This behavior suggests processes that hinder diﬀusion . Since the formation of protein complexes is governed by diﬀusion - mediated encounters , hindered diﬀusion plays fundamental roles in cell function . Unveiling the underlying mechanisms leading to the observed anomalous diﬀusion on the cell membrane is critical to understanding cell behavior . Anomalous diﬀusion in the plasma membrane can be caused by macromolecular crowding [ 14 ] , transient binding [ 15 ] , heterogeneities [ 16 , 17 ] , and membrane compartmental - ization by the underlying cytoskeleton [ 2 , 9 , 18 , 19 ] . In recent years it has become evident that a single mech - anism cannot account for the complex dynamics ob - served in the plasma membrane [ 13 ] . We have shown that interactions with clathrin coated pits ( CCPs ) cause anomalous diﬀusion and ergodicity breaking [ 15 , 20 ] . However , it was observed that this process coexisted with a diﬀerent anomalous diﬀusion mechanism at - tributed to diﬀusion within a fractal topology . Ex - perimental evidence for the organization of the plasma membrane by the cortical actin cytoskeleton has been provided by measurements in cell blebs , spherical protrusions that lack actin cytoskeleton [ 21 ] , and in the presence of actin - disrupting agents [ 9 , 22 , 23 ] . The picket - fence model explains these observations by postulating that the mobility of membrane - bound molecules is hindered by the actin - based cytoskeleton in close proximity to the plasma membrane , leading to transient conﬁnement [ 2 , 24 , 25 ] . Conﬁnement and seg - regation of membrane components can have important physiological consequences by allowing the formation of functional domains on the cell surface . However , in spite of the vast evidence that has accumulated over the last two decades , a direct observation of the dynamic compartmentalization of membrane proteins by under - lying actin fences is challenging due to the spatial and temporal resolutions required for its visualization . Here we employ superresolution imaging and single - particle tracking of membrane proteins to elucidate the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane by intracellular structures . While tracking individual voltage - gated potassium channels as described in our previous studies [ 15 ] , we found that these membrane proteins exhibited anomalous diﬀusion on the cell sur - face . We now report that the anticorrelated dynam - ics are best modeled by obstructed diﬀusion instead of fractional Brownian motion and we directly visu - alize the transient conﬁnement of potassium channels by cortical actin in live cells . In order to character - ize the cortical actin meshwork , we employ stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) to obtain superresolution images in ﬁxed cells . We ﬁnd a non - integer fractal dimension for the actin cortex and a 2 broad distribution of compartment sizes as expected for a self - similar structure . These observations con - sistently explain the anticorrelated subdiﬀusive motion of membrane proteins and provide new insights on the hierarchical organization of the plasma membrane . II . RESULTS A . Kv1 . 4 and Kv2 . 1 ion channels undergo subdiﬀusion in the plasma membrane Voltage - gated potassium channels Kv1 . 4 and Kv2 . 1 were expressed in human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) cells , labeled with quantum dots ( QDs ) [ 15 ] , and im - aged using total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy at 50 frames / s , so that individual molecules could be detected on the cell surface . Kv1 . 4 and 2 . 1 are similar in size , 654 and 853 amino acids , respectively , but share less than 20 % overall amino acid identity [ 26 ] . They are placed into distinct gene subfamilies because of this low identity . They are most similar within a central core domain composed of six transmembrane alpha helices and the ion conducting pore . In contrast , they share no amino sequence identity within the cyto - plasmic N - and C - terminal regions ; each Kv1 . 4 subunit has 402 cytoplasmic amino acids while the Kv2 . 1 sub - units have 624 . Both channels exist as homotetrameric structures giving the functional channel 24 membrane spanning domains and a total of either 1608 or 2496 cytoplasmic amino acids . Figure 1 ( a ) shows representa - tive trajectories of Kv1 . 4 channels . The motion of the ion channels was initially evaluated in terms of their time - averaged MSD , δ 2 ( ∆ ) = 1 T − ∆ Z T − ∆ 0 | r ( t + ∆ ) − r ( t ) | 2 d t , ( 1 ) where T is the total experimental time , r the parti - cle position , and ∆ the lag time , i . e . , the time diﬀer - ence over which the MSD is computed . When a parti - cle displays Brownian diﬀusion , the MSD is linear in lag time , i . e . , δ 2 ( ∆ ) ∼ ∆ . In contrast , anomalous diﬀusion is characterized by a diﬀerent MSD scaling , namely MSD ∼ ∆ α , where α is the anomalous expo - nent . Anomalous diﬀusion is classiﬁed as subdiﬀusion when 0 < α < 1 and superdiﬀusion when α > 1 . Figure 1 ( b ) shows the MSD of 20 individual trajecto - ries . The MSDs of Kv1 . 4 as well as Kv2 . 1 channels show subdiﬀusive behavior , albeit with large apparent ﬂuctu - ations . Figures 1 ( c ) and 1 ( d ) show the MSDs averaged over 1 , 312 Kv1 . 4 ( n = 10 cells ) and 6 , 385 Kv2 . 1 ( n = 14 cells ) trajectories , respectively , D δ 2 ( ∆ ) E . Throughout the manuscript we employ overlines to denote time av - erages and brackets to denote ensemble averages . The anomalous exponent α of Kv1 . 4 was found to be 0 . 89 and that of Kv2 . 1 was 0 . 74 , indicating subdiﬀusion in both cases . Several distinct mathematical models lead to subd - iﬀusion [ 11 – 13 ] . Among the most well - accepted types of subdiﬀusion in biological systems , we encounter ( i ) obstructed diﬀusion , ( ii ) fractional Brownian motion ( fBM ) , and ( iii ) continuous time random walks ( CTRW ) . Both fBM [ 27 , 28 ] and obstructed diﬀusion [ 29 – 31 ] are models for subdiﬀusive random walks with anticorre - lated increments that have been extensively used in live cells . fBM describes the motion in a viscoelastic ﬂuid [ 32 , 33 ] , which can be caused by macromolecular crowding [ 34 , 35 ] . fBM is a generalization of Brownian motion that incorporates correlations with power - law memory . It is characterized by a Hurst exponent H that translates into an anomalous exponent α = 2 H . Obstructed diﬀusion describes the motion of a particle hindered by immobile ( or slowly moving ) obstacles , e . g . , percolation . As the concentration of immobile obsta - cles increases , the availability of space decreases . Near a critical concentration known as percolation threshold , the obstacles form a fractal with dead ends in all length scales . In particular , the reduction of the available space results in anomalous diﬀusion with a recurrent exploration pattern . A CTRW is a generalization of a random walk where a particle waits for a random time between steps [ 36 ] . When the waiting times are asymp - totically distributed according to a power law such that the mean waiting time diverges , the CTRW is subdiﬀu - sive . These three models describe very distinct physical underlying mechanisms but they can yield similar sub - linear MSD scaling , particularly in obstructed diﬀusion and fBM models . Thus the MSD analysis is insuﬃcient to elucidate the type of random walk . Diﬀerent tests beyond the MSD have been employed to distinguish among types of subdiﬀusive random walks , including p - variations [ 37 ] , ﬁrst passage prob - ability distribution [ 38 ] , mean maximal excursion [ 39 ] , Gaussianity [ 40 ] , and fractal dimensions [ 41 ] . Here we employ the distribution of directional changes , i . e . , the turning angles , a tool that probes correlations in the particle displacements and has been shown to contain information on the complexity of a random walk [ 42 ] . Figure 1 ( e ) illustrates the construction of turning angles from a particle trajectory . In simple Brownian motion , the turning angles are uniformly distributed . Contrast - ingly , when the steps are correlated the distribution of turning angles is not uniform [ 42 ] . Figures 1 ( f ) and 1 ( g ) show the distribution of turning angles of Kv1 . 4 and Kv2 . 1 for diﬀerent lag times ( 1 , 312 Kv1 . 4 tracks , 10 cells and 6 , 385 Kv2 . 1 tracks , 14 cells ) . Both distributions peak at θ = 180 ◦ indicating the particles are more likely to turn back than to move forward . In other words , Kv channels have a preference to go in the di - rection from where they came rather than to persist moving in the same direction . This property is a ﬁn - 3 ~ t 0 . 74 ~ t 0 45 90 135 180 0 0 . 004 0 . 008 0 . 012 P r o b a b i l i t y d e n s i t y Turning angle Kv2 . 1 ΔC318 θ 1 θ 2 ( e ) ( j ) ( f ) ( g ) Turning angle 0 0 . 005 0 . 010 c = 41 % c = 33 % percolation P r o b a b i l i t y d e n s i t y 0 0 . 005 0 . 010 H = 0 . 4 H = 0 . 3 fractional BM Turning angle P r o b a b i l i t y d e n s i t y ( h ) ( i ) 0 45 90 135 180 0 45 90 135 180 E A - T A - M S D ( μ m 2 ) Lag time , ∆ ( s ) ( c ) Lag time , ∆ ( s ) ( d ) E A - T A - M S D ( μ m 2 ) 0 . 1 1 0 . 01 0 . 1 ~ t 0 . 89 ~ t 0 . 1 1 0 . 01 0 . 1 220 frames ( 4 . 4 s ) 1 μm 180 frames ( 3 . 6 s ) 250 frames ( 5 s ) 150 frames ( 3 s ) ( a ) T A - M S D ( μ m 2 ) Lag time , ∆ ( s ) ( b ) Kv1 . 4 Kv2 . 1 Kv1 . 4 0 . 012 0 0 . 004 0 . 008 P r o b a b i l i t y d e n s i t y Turning angle 0 . 08 s 0 . 2 s 0 . 4 s 1 s 0 45 90 135 180 Kv1 . 4 0 0 . 004 0 . 008 0 . 012 P r o b a b i l i t y d e n s i t y Turning angle 0 45 90 135 180 0 . 08 s 0 . 2 s 0 . 4 s 1 s Kv2 . 1 ( k ) 0 . 02 s 0 . 04 s 0 . 1 1 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 ~ t ~ t ΔC318 Lag time , ∆ ( s ) E A - T A - M S D ( μ m 2 ) 0 . 1 1 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 FIG . 1 .

Besides the shape of the distribution , the dependence on lag time bears valuable information . Strikingly , we observe that the distribution is indepen - dent of lag time , i . e . , we measure the same distribution of directional changes whether the lag time is 20 ms or 1 s . We examined numerical simulations of fBM and ob - structed diﬀusion and found that they have distinctive attributes in their distribution of directional changes . Figure 1 ( h ) shows the distribution of directional changes for subdiﬀusive fBM simulations with Hurst exponents H = 0 . 3 and 0 . 4 . Even though the distributions peak at 180 ◦ , the probability density function is diﬀerent from the experimental data [ Figs . 1 ( f ) and 1 ( g ) ] . In our exper - imental data , the turning angle distributions increase sharply as θ approaches 180 ◦ and most of the devia - tions from a uniform distribution are above 90 ◦ . How - ever , fBM gives rise to a gradual increase that takes place mainly in the range 45 ◦ < θ < 135 ◦ . Further , the turning angles of fBM reach a plateau , in contrast to our measurements . Conversely , obstructed diﬀusion , strongly resembles our experimental results . Figure 1 ( i ) shows the turning angle distribution for obstructed dif - fusion simulations in a square lattice with obstacle con - centrations 33 % and 41 % [ 31 ] . Note that 41 % is slightly above the percolation threshold . These results show that the motion of Kv channels in the plasma mem - brane is better modeled by percolation , i . e . , obstructed diﬀusion , rather than motion in a viscoelastic medium , i . e . , fBM . Potential obstacle candidates for obstructed diﬀusion in the plasma membrane are the cortical cytoskeleton , lipid rafts , and extracellular glycans . By evaluating the MSD and turning angle distribution of ∆ C318 , a mu - tant in which the last 318 amino acids of the C - terminus of Kv2 . 1 channel had been deleted [ 43 ] , we found that the anticorrelated diﬀusion originates from interactions with intracellular structures . We observed that ∆ C318 channels diﬀuse freely in the plasma membrane , α = 1 4 with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = 0 . 19 µ m 2 / s [ Fig . 1 ( j ) , n = 3114 tracks , 5 cells ] . Further , the distribution of turn - ing angles of ∆ C318 was ﬂattened , as expected for Brownian diﬀusion [ Fig . 1 ( k ) ] , indicating the intracel - lular C terminal domain of Kv2 . 1 plays a key role in the anticorrelations within the particle trajectory . Even though the distribution of turning angles in the ∆ C318 mutant is close to that in Brownian motion , a small peak is still noticeable at 180 ◦ suggesting additional complexities in the plasma membrane . In contrast to Kv1 . 4 , which is homogeneously dis - tributed on the cell membrane , a subpopulation of Kv2 . 1 channels forms micron - sized clusters that local - ize to endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) - plasma membrane junctions [ 44 , 45 ] . Thus , we expect both the ER and the cortical cytoskeleton introduce intracellular interac - tions with Kv2 . 1 channels . To identify the origin of the observed anticorrelated diﬀusion , we analyzed the mo - tion of non - clustered Kv2 . 1 channels , i . e . , the channels that reside outside ER - plasma membrane junctions . We labeled Kv2 . 1 channels both with green ﬂuorescent pro - tein ( GFP ) and QDs [ 45 ] . While all the channels were labeled with GFP , only a small fraction included QDs in order to enable both single - particle tracking and cluster identiﬁcation [ supplementary Fig . S1 ] . We ob - served that the distribution of directional changes of non - clustered channels is indistinguishable from that of the overall population [ supplementary Fig . S2 ] . Thus , we can exclude interactions with the ER as the cause for anticorrelated subdiﬀusion . These observations suggest that diﬀusion is hindered by intracellular components , possibly the cortical cytoskeleton , in agreement with a membrane - skeleton fence model [ 2 ] . We observed that the distribution of turning angles were independent of lag times [ Figs . 1 ( f ) and 1 ( g ) ] within the probed spatial and temporal scales . These obser - vations indicated the anticorrelated subdiﬀusion of Kv channels did not have an evident characteristic time scale . This type of random walk is consistent with diﬀu - sion on a self - similar structure , i . e . , a fractal subspace . In order to visualize the diﬀerence between diﬀusion on a fractal structure , and diﬀusion on a meshwork with a characteristic length scale , we performed simulations of motion of a particle in the presence of permeable fences that introduce compartments with a well - deﬁned length scale [ supplementary Fig . S3 ] . In these simulations , we observed that the distribution of turning angles is not time invariant ; the peak at 180 ◦ grows as we increase the lag - time up to a characteristic time , and then it de - cays when the lag - time increases further [ supplemen - tary Figs . S3 ( b ) and S3 ( c ) ] . Thus , hop - diﬀusion with a narrow distribution of conﬁnement sizes exhibits a time - dependent turning angle distribution ( with a well - deﬁned characteristic time scale ) , in contrast to our ex - perimental results where the turning angle distribution is time - invariant . B . Cortical actin transiently conﬁnes Kv1 . 4 and Kv2 . 1 channels We observed that Kv channels undergo obstructed diﬀusion . The ∆ C318 mutant data indicated that hin - dering of the particle motion originated within cyto - plasmic structures in close proximity to the plasma membrane , in agreement with previous experimental evidence of transient conﬁnement by the actin - based cytoskeleton [ 9 , 21 , 46 – 48 ] . Thus we examined the cor - tical actin as a candidate for the observed obstructed diﬀusion in the plasma membrane . We imaged the cortical actin in live HEK cells us - ing the photoactivatable probe tdEosFP [ 49 ] via an actin binding peptide ( ABP ) that reversibly binds to F - actin [ 50 ] . Previous studies showed that expression of ABP - tdEosFP does not aﬀect the organization of the cytoskeleton [ 50 , 51 ] . By activating a sparse subset of tdEosFP and individually localizing them with high precision , we generated photoactivated localization mi - croscopy ( PALM ) images using localizations from 100 frames ( 2 s ) , yielding a smooth video of the dynamic actin meshwork ( supplementary Video S1 ) . Both exci - tation and photoactivation were implemented in total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) so that only the actin adjacent to the plasma membrane was imaged . The dissociation of ABP - tdEosFP occurs with a time constant on the order of 40 s [ 50 ] , thus the exchange within 2 - s imaging is negligible . Figure 2 ( a ) shows a representative PALM reconstruc - tion of actin . Although the number of localizations in 100 frames is not adequate to fully resolve the cortical actin and some faint ﬂuorescent single - ﬁlament struc - tures might be missed in the images , we could use the reconstructed PALM image to study the interactions of the potassium channels with the actin cortex in live cells . Previous breakthrough experiments have reported simultaneous imaging of cortical actin cytoskeleton and single - particle tracking [ 48 , 52 , 53 ] . Here , to the best of our knowledge , we perform for the ﬁrst time simultane - ous single - particle tracking measurements and imaging cortical actin with superresolution . In order to ﬁnd out whether actin - delimited domains as identiﬁed by PALM hinder diﬀusion and compart - mentalize the cell surface , we imaged and tracked Kv1 . 4 and Kv2 . 1 channels on the cell surface while simul - taneously imaging the cortical actin . Channels often remained conﬁned within the areas enclosed by actin indicating actin acted as a barrier to channel diﬀu - sion . Figures 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) show Kv2 . 1 channel tracks for one video overlaid on the last reconstructed im - age of the cortical actin . However , this visualization method suﬀers from overlaying long trajectories on a single reconstruction image of the actin meshwork . In addition to being constrained by actin structures , some trajectories exhibit conﬁnement within small nanoscale 5 ( c ) ( d ) 0 100 200 300 400 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 d ( nm ) 0 100 200 300 400 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 d ( nm ) Kv1 . 4 Kv2 . 1 ( a ) r 2 ( μ m 2 ) < > r 2 ( μ m 2 ) < > d ( nm ) r 2 ( μ m 2 ) < > 0 100 200 300 400 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 ( e ) ΔC318 ( b ) FIG . 2 .

Error bars indicate standard errors . domains that do not appear to be enclosed by actin . We have previously shown that Kv channels exhibit fre - quent immobilizations when the channels are captured within clathrin - coated pits [ 20 ] . Thus , the cortical actin cytoskeleton is not the sole mechanism by which the mobility of Kv channels is hindered . In order to deal with these complexities , we evaluated the MSDs as a function of proximity to actin . Given that actin hinders channel motility , we ex - pect the particles to explore smaller areas when they are conﬁned within smaller compartments . To test the actin fence hypothesis , we overlaid channel trajectories on the corresponding PALM image of actin obtained in 2 s , a time scale in which the actin structure is fairly persistent [ supplementary video 1 ] , with a sliding time window 0 . 2 s . For example , trajectories of the chan - nels from 0 to 2 s were overlaid on the ﬁrst recon - structed actin frame and the trajectories in the interval 200 ms to 2 . 2 s were overlaid on the second actin PALM frame . Then we partitioned the trajectories into 200 - ms intervals and classiﬁed each segment according to the maximum distance d of the particle to the nearest actin feature , calculated using an Euclidean distance map algorithm . We evaluated the ensemble - averaged MSD h r 2 i of all the segments located at a speciﬁc dis - tance away from actin , i . e . , we averaged the squared displacements in 200 ms of the particles transiently lo - cated a given distance from actin . Figures 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) show the MSD as a function of distance - to - actin for Kv1 . 4 and Kv2 . 1 . For both channels we observed that as molecules dwell closer to actin their MSD decreases . As a control of our method , we performed the same analysis for ∆ C318 channels . Because of the lack of the intracellular domain , these channels should not have any interaction with the cortical cytoskeleton . We ob - served that the MSD of ∆ C318 channels is independent of distance from actin [ Fig . 2 ( e ) ] , which demonstrates the eﬀect of intracellular structure in the transient con - ﬁnement of Kv channels . C . Characterization of cortical actin meshwork When imaging live cells with PALM , the number of frames used in the reconstruction is restricted by the cell dynamic nature . A low number of frames results in insuﬃcient detected particles to accurately determine the structure , also having a deleterious eﬀect on res - olution . In contrast , very high spatial resolution can be obtained in ﬁxed cells by collecting data over long times [ 54 – 56 ] . Therefore , we used TIRF - STORM to visualize the compartments formed by cortical actin in ﬁxed cells . Actin was labeled with phalloidin con - jugated to Alexa Fluor 647 , which binds actin ﬁla - ments with high speciﬁcity without signiﬁcantly enlarg - ing them [ 56 ] . A total of 50 , 000 frames where used in the reconstruction . In our STORM reconstructions we observed both thick and thin actin structures , Fig 3 ( a ) . The ﬁnest structures that we observed had a cross sec - tion standard deviation of 20 nm ( FWHM = 48 nm ) .

Areas are shown in logarithmic scale and the red line is a log - normal distribution with shape parameter σ = 0 . 8 µm . ure 3 ( b ) shows the average cross section proﬁle of 20 lines aligned by the center of each line . The thickness of these lines in the reconstruction is governed by the localization accuracy , 20 ± 8 nm ( mean ± SD , supple - mentary Fig . S4 ) , which sets a lower bound on STORM resolution . Thus we are unable to determine whether these structures are individual ﬁlaments ( 10 nm in di - ameter ) or actin bundles . We employed a watershed segmentation algorithm [ 57 ] to identify actin - delimited compartments in the STORM reconstructions [ Figs . 3 ( c ) and 3 ( d ) ] across the whole cell . The average percentage of the watershed meshwork covered by actin was 84 ± 4 % ( mean ± SD , n = 9 cells ) . Figure 3 ( e ) shows the distribution of com - partment areas ( n = 2 , 500 compartments ) . The areas of the compartments are ﬁtted well by a log - normal dis - tribution , which is a subexponential heavy - tailed distri - bution in the sense that it decays more slowly than any exponential tail [ 58 ] . The log - normal distribution is in good agreement with Kolmogorov’s model for the distribution of particle sizes after repeated breakage [ 59 , 60 ] . When a particle is divided into fragments in such a way that the fragment proportions are in - dependent of the original particle size , a log - normal distribution emerges in the particle sizes after random repeated fragmentation . Analogously , actin - delimited compartments are split into smaller compartments by growing actin ﬁlaments and thus their distribution is predicted to be log - normal . In addition to the compartment area distribution , the relation between perimeter and area contains valuable ( b ) ( a ) C o u n t s Box Size , ε ( pixels ) 1 10 100 1000 1 10 2 10 4 10 6 ~ ε - 1 . 75 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 0 . 1 1 10 P e r i m e t e r ( μ m ) Area ( μm 2 ) FIG . 4 .

Perimeter - area relations have been exten - sively used to investigate the properties of complex pla - nar shapes [ 61 , 62 ] . As expected , we observe that ar - eas and perimeters of the diﬀerent compartments are highly correlated [ Fig . 4 ( a ) ] . This correlation indicates shape homogeneity among diﬀerent compartments [ 63 ] . Furthermore , the area exhibits the same scaling over the whole observed range , A ∼ L 1 . 8 , where A and L are compartment area and perimeter , indicating the same statistical character at diﬀerent scales , and sug - gesting that compartments formed by cortical actin are scale - invariant in the observed range . Such scale in - variance is a hallmark of a self - similar fractal struc - tures . 7 Fractals are characterized by scaling properties gov - erned by a non - integer dimension d f , i . e . , an anoma - lous dependence of the “mass” on the linear size of the system with M ∼ l d f . In a regular object such as a line , square , or cube , we would refer to its mass M as the length , area or volume , respectively . In these reg - ular cases the mass scales as M ∼ l d , where the l is the linear size and d = 1 , 2 , 3 is the spatial dimension . On the other hand , fractals such as a Sierpinsky gasket or a percolation cluster diﬀer from Euclidean spaces and display a fractional dimension [ 61 , 64 ] . Usually the capacity dimension is obtained using a box - counting algorithm that quantiﬁes the mass scaling . In brief , the structure is placed on a grid , the number of occu - pied “boxes” are counted , and the process is iterated for ﬁner grids . The number of occupied boxes scales as N ∼ ǫ − d f , where ǫ is the box length . Figure 4 ( b ) shows the computation of the fractal dimension of the cortical actin meshwork from the STORM image in a represen - tative cell . The box counting analysis shows the actin structure exhibits statistical self - similarity over more than three decades . Our data indicate the fractal di - mension of the meshwork is d f = 1 . 75 ± 0 . 02 ( n = 9 cells ) . III . DISCUSSION Our current understanding of the plasma membrane is that of a complex partitioned ﬂuid where molecules often undergo anomalous diﬀusion and can be segre - gated according to their function . We observe that K + channels perform a random walk with antipersistent nature , i . e . , a random walk with an increased probabil - ity of returning to the site it just left . However elucidat - ing the mechanisms that cause anomalous diﬀusion is not trivial because several diﬀerent subdiﬀusion mod - els lead to similar MSD scaling . The analysis of K + channel motion is further complicated by the occur - rence of immobilizations with power law sojourn times , which introduce deviations from Gaussian functions in the distribution of displacements [ 15 , 20 ] . Thus , we cannot employ Gaussianity - based tests to distinguish among complex antipersistent random walks . We ﬁnd that the distribution of directional changes provides a robust test for the type of random walk . The measured channel trajectories are shown to be well described by obstructed diﬀusion but not by fBM . We observed that the Kv2 . 1 intracellular domain played a key role in the anomalous diﬀusion , in agree - ment with previous observations showing that the depth at which a membrane protein extends into the cytoplasm determined how frequently it encountered mechanical barriers [ 47 ] . The obvious candidate to ob - struct the motion of proteins with large intracellular do - mains is the actin cytoskeleton . Thus , we visualized the cortical actin with high temporal and spatial resolution and evaluated its eﬀect on membrane protein dynam - ics . Considering that some faint single - ﬁlament actin structures might not be accurately detected by PALM imaging , we can miss some interactions between actin and membrane proteins . Notwithstanding , we found that Kv channels are transiently conﬁned by perme - able actin fences , conﬁrming existing models for mem - brane compartmentalization as an organizing principle of the actin cytoskeleton [ 2 ] . By studying the diﬀusion of Kv2 . 1 channels outside ER - plasma membrane junc - tions , we veriﬁed that the observed subdiﬀusion is not due to interactions with ER . Other intracellular compo - nents such as intermediate ﬁlaments could also hinder protein diﬀusion and further compartmentalize the cell membrane , but these cytoskeletal ﬁlaments were not studied in the present work . Previous single - particle tracking works using lipids labeled with 40 - nm gold nanoparticles have observed the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells , with 70 - nm mean compartment size [ 1 ] . However , this compartmen - talization occurs with molecules having virtually no cy - toplasmic domains and with a residence time close to 3 ms . At time scales above 50 ms , gold - labeled lipids were found to exhibit Brownian diﬀusion with an eﬀec - tive diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = 0 . 41 µ m 2 / s [ 1 ] , similar to our observations for ∆ C318 Kv2 . 1 mutant . Ion channels are observed to undergo anticorrelated anomalous diﬀusion over at least two orders of magni - tude in time . In terms of percolation theory , this hints the cell surface is maintained close to criticality , i . e . , near the percolation threshold . However , this hypothe - sis seems highly unlikely . A more feasible explanation stems from the emergence of a scale - invariant structure under the plasma membrane . We directly observed that , within the probed spatial scale , the actin cortex has in fact a self - similar nature . It is possible to spec - ulate that actin fractality develops from its branching structure . Hierarchically branched structures have a fractal dimension d f such that R b = R d f r , where R b is the bifurcation ratio and R r is the length - order ratio [ 65 ] . The bifurcation ratio can be interpreted as the average number of branches that emerge after a bifur - cation and the length - order ratio is deﬁned as the ra - tio between incoming branch length and the length of the emerging branches until the next bifurcation [ 66 ] . Actin branching is driven by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 67 ] with a bifurcation ratio R b = 2 . Here we measure a meshwork fractal dimension d f = 1 . 75 , which can arise from a branching pattern with R r = 1 . 5 or , in other words , the daughter branch being on average 1 / 3 shorter than the mother branch . The fractal dimension of the cytoskeleton is in line with a broad range of frac - tal geometries found in biology ranging from the lung alveoli to subcellular structures such as mitochondrial membranes and the endoplasmic reticulum [ 61 ] . 8 We propose that the fractal nature of the actin cortex is employed by the cell to organize the plasma mem - brane . The complexity of this structure leads to a hier - archical organization with domains in multiple length scales and the development of nested compartments . Such a dynamic hierarchical organization facilitates the active segregation of domains with diﬀerent functions and the maintenance of reactants near reaction cen - ters . Furthermore , the fractal nature of the cortical actin has broad implications for anomalous diﬀusion , for instance it could bridge the gap between the plasma membrane hop diﬀusion models and diﬀusion in a frac - tal that leads to anomalous dynamics over broad time scales . We foresee that a self - similar cytoskeleton struc - ture also inﬂuences active actomyosin - mediated orga - nization of the plasma membrane [ 68 ] in such a way that these processes can take place over multiple length scales . In conclusion , our ﬁndings show that the plasma membrane is compartmentalized in a hierarchical fash - ion by a dynamic cortical actin fractal . We ﬁnd that the anomalous diﬀusion of potassium channels is best modeled by obstructed diﬀusion or diﬀusion in a frac - tal . By combining PALM imaging with single - particle tracking we were able to directly visualize the hindering eﬀect of cortical actin on the diﬀusion of the membrane proteins . We characterized the compartments formed by cortical actin using superresolution imaging in ﬁxed cells and found evidence for the self - similar topology of this structure . IV . MATERIALS AND METHODS A . Cell transfection and labeling . HEK 293 cells ( passage 42 - 49 ; American Type Cul - ture Collection ) were cultured in phenol red Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco ) at 37 ◦ C . Cells were transfected to express a Kv2 . 1 or Kv1 . 4 construct with an extracellular biotin acceptor domain that , when coexpressed with a bacterial biotin ligase , results in bi - otinylated Kv channels on the cell surface [ 69 ] . For live - cell actin imaging cells were transfected with 3 µ g of ABP - tdEos . ABP is the actin - binding sequence of ABP140 from S . cerevisiae consisting of 17 amino acids [ 50 , 51 ] . Kv2 . 1 - loopBAD - GFP ( 3 µ g ) was employed to identify Kv2 . 1 clusters on the cell surface . For single - particle tracking , biotinylated channels were labeled with QDs . Cells were incubated for 10 minutes in HEK imaging saline with 1 nM streptavidin - conjugated QD705 or QD655 ( Invitrogen ) and 10 mg / mL bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) [ 15 ] at 37 ◦ C . Fol - lowing incubation the cells were rinsed again six times with HEK imaging saline to ensure the removal of any unbound QDs . The diameter of the QDs is in the range 10 - 15 nm , thus given that Kv channels are similar in size to the QDs , it is highly unlikely that the Kv : QD stoichiometry is higher than 1 : 1 . We have previously shown that QD conjugation does not alter Kv channel diﬀusion [ 15 , 20 ] . B . Live cell imaging . Imaging was performed in an objective - based TIRF microscope built around an IX71 Olympus body . Sam - ple temperature was kept at 37 ◦ C using objective and stage heater ( Bioptechs ) . A 405 - nm laser was used to activate tdEosFP ﬂuorophore , while 473 - nm and 561 - nm lasers were used to excite it in its inactive and active states , respectively . C . Single - particle tracking . QD labeling was controlled so that QDs remained at low density to allow for single - particle tracking [ 15 ] . Particle detection and tracking were performed in MATLAB using u - track [ 70 ] . D . Fixed cell imaging . Cells were plated on Matrigel - coated 35 mm petri dishes . After 12 hours the cells were ﬁxed and labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 - phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) . Image stacks were obtained using the same setup as live cell imaging . A continuous illumination of 638 - nm laser was used to excite the Alexa Fluor 647 . The laser power before the objective was 30 mW . To maintain an appropriate density of activated molecules , 405 - nm laser was used in some experiments . 50 , 000 frames were collected to generate a superresolution image . E . Fractal dimension . The fractal dimension of the actin cortex was com - puted using a box - counting algorithm . The thresholded binary actin image was placed on a grid of square boxes of size ǫ and the number of occupied boxes was counted . The process was repeated for grids of boxes with diﬀerent sizes . The number of occupied boxes scales as N ∼ ǫ − d f , ( 2 ) where d f is the capacity dimension , or simply the frac - tal dimension . 9 F . Statistics Results show mean and s . e . m . unless indicated oth - erwise . All experimental results were obtained from multiple diﬀerent dishes and days . The number of dis - tinct imaging regions , i . e . , diﬀerent cells is indicated in the text .
