ABSTRACT ( 197 words ) : The tumor microenvironment and wound healing after injury , both contain extremely high concentrations of the extracellular signaling molecule , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) compared to normal tissue . P2Y2 receptor , an ATP - activated purinergic receptor , is typically associated with pulmonary , endothelial , and neurological cell signaling . Here we report its role and importance in breast epithelial cell signaling and how it’s altered in metastatic breast cancer . In response to ATP activation , P2Y2 receptor signaling causes an increase of intracellular Ca 2 + in non - tumorigenic breast epithelial cells , while their tumorigenic and metastatic counterparts have significantly reduced Ca 2 + responses . The non - tumorigenic cells respond to increased Ca 2 + with actin polymerization and localization to cellular junctions , while the metastatic cells remained unaffected . The increase in intracellular Ca 2 + after ATP stimulation could be blunted using a P2Y2 antagonist , which also prevented actin mobilization in non - tumorigenic breast epithelial cells . Furthermore , the lack of Ca 2 + concentration changes and actin mobilization in the metastatic breast cancer cells could be due to reduced P2Y2 expression , which correlates with poorer overall survival in breast cancer patients . This study elucidates rapid changes that occur after elevated intracellular Ca 2 + in breast epithelial cells and how metastatic cancer cells have adapted to evade this cellular response . INTRODUCTION : Wound healing and the tumor microenvironment ( TME ) have many parallel molecular markers , gene expression patterns , and phenotypes including , inflammation , proliferation , and migration . 1 – 3 Moreover , genomic studies have shown that invasive tumors and wound repair have similar gene expression patterns and display similarities between microenvironments . 3 , 4 The TME consists of intra - and extracellular communication between non - malignant , resident and recruited cells , and the transformed tumor cells . 5 , 6 One factor present at high , persistent levels within the TME is adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , released by tumor and stromal cells in a regulated or non - regulated manner . 7 – 9 Pellegatti et al found that ATP concentration ranged in the hundreds of micromolar in the tumor interstitium , while normal tissue has undetectable levels of extracellular ATP . 8 This extracellular ATP , well studied in neurotransmission , is an ideal messenger with high sensitivity due to low extracellular physiological concentrations , a rapid off - switch to avoid overstimulation or desensitization from a multitude of extracellular nucleotidases , and its ability to easily diffuse through aqueous tissues . 7 , 10 These signaling and TME characteristics , make it critical to investigate the role of extracellular ATP in tumor signaling , immunosuppression , growth , migration , and invasion . Activated by extracellular ATP , uridine triphosphate ( UTP ) , adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , and uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) , the P2 receptors play a diverse role in neurotransmission , developmental biology , cardiac and pulmonary function , the apoptotic cascade , metastasis , as well as many other bodily functions . 11 P2 receptors are divided into two families , P2X , a ligand - gated ionotropic channel , and P2Y , a metabotropic G - protein coupled receptor ( GPCR ) , this paper will focus on the latter . 11 ATP signaling via P2Y2 receptors has been shown in a few cancer studies , like prostate , liver , pancreatic , colorectal , and nasopharyngeal , but has remained more elusive in breast cancer research . 12 – 17 A previous study showed altered purinergic receptor - Ca 2 + signaling in endothelial growth factor ( EGF ) - induced epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and later in hypoxia - induced EMT in breast cancer cells . 18 , 19 While these previous studies have found correlation between purinergic signaling and cancer , most studies are using phenotypic assays based in cancer biology , which probe for slow cellular responses may take hours and days to respond . In contrast , we investigate rapid phenotypes occurring within seconds to minutes after purinergic receptor activation via ATP and how responses might vary in breast cancer compared to non - tumorigenic cells . Interestingly , purinergic signaling , specifically P2Y2 receptor , has been understudied in breast cancer and remains an interesting target to further investigate for therapy . 20 – 22 Current breast cancer treatments include surgery , systemic therapy based on subtype , and chemotherapy , but metastatic disease remains nearly incurable . 23 Approximately 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime , making female breast cancer the most diagnosed new case of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death . 24 Breast cancer can be organized into 3 subtypes based on gene amplification of epidermal growth factor 2 ( ERBB2 ) and expression of estrogen or progesterone receptors . 23 While available systemic therapies target HER2 or hormone receptor positive subtypes , triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) lacks all three markers , and therefore , is more metastatic and most challenging to treat . 5 - year survival rate can also vary based on the stage of breast cancer at diagnosis . There is an 86 - 96 % 5 - year survival rate for regional and localized breast cancers , while distant breast cancers have only a 29 % 5 - year survival rate . 24 Another marker of poor survival in cancer patients is KRAS , a proto - oncogene and member of the RAS family of small GTPases . Only a single amino acid substitution is needed for an activating mutation at codon 12 , 13 , or 61 . 25 Activating KRAS mutations have been associated with various human cancers , including lung adenocarcinoma , colorectal , and pancreatic carcinomas . 26 In breast cancer patients , KRAS is not the most common genetic mutation but it is present in around 30 % of TNBCs . 27 Previous work in our lab has led to the development of MCF10A cells with step - wise mutations of a PTEN double knockout and a KRAS activating mutation ( 10A - PTEN - / - KRas ) , that progressively push the cells towards tumorigenic transformation and metastasis . 28 With all of the variations of breast cancer subtype and stage at the time of diagnosis , treatment plans and prognosis can range drastically for patients . Further research is needed to better target TNBCs and metastatic breast cancer . Some research has linked P2Y2 receptor activation to increased migration via downstream modulators of the Ras pathway , like MEK - ERK in MCF7 breast cancer cells . 29 Our lab previously showed that a scratch assay , similar to a wound edge , on breast epithelial cells transiently release ATP extracellularly , which activates P2Y2 receptor in neighboring cells and yields a signaling cascade which increases intracellular calcium ( Ca 2 + ) . 30 Other research has linked increased intracellular Ca 2 + and actin polymerization around the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum in mammalian epithelial , mesenchymal , endothelial , and immune cells . 31 Lasting only minutes before the actin cortex reformed , this rapid response was termed calcium - mediated actin reset ( CaAR ) . 31 Elevated intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations also affect T lymphocyte activation , which is mediated by T cell receptor ( TCR ) clustering and dependent upon actin cortex interactions and movement to the cell surface . 32 When there is an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + leading to actin polymerization and increased interactions with TCR , reducing its mobility to the cell surface . 32 Furthermore , Ca 2 + fluxes and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton have been evolutionarily conserved , and shown to play a role in Drosophila epithelial wound closure . 33 Whether ATP - P2Y2 - Ca 2 + signaling in breast cancer has a similar molecular and functional mechanism regarding actin polymerization is still unknown . It is well known that high extracellular concentrations of ATP are found in the TME , similar to a wound edge , and here we report that ATP alone is sufficient to stimulate an intracellular Ca 2 + response in multiple breast epithelial and metastatic cancer cell lines . We demonstrate that ATP - activated P2Y2 receptors leads to a substantial increase in intracellular Ca 2 + and a rapid polymerization of the actin network in non - tumorigenic breast epithelial cells . In contrast , metastatic breast cancer cells have an attenuated response to ATP with only a modest increase in intracellular Ca 2 + . We also show that metastatic breast cancer cells have decreased expression of P2Y2 receptors , which could lead to their blunted Ca 2 + response . Similarly , a chemical inhibitor of P2Y2 is able to recapitulate the insensitivity to ATP in the responsive non - malignant breast epithelial cells . Finally , we show that ATP - stimulated Ca 2 + fluxes promote rapid changes in the actin cortex of non - tumorigenic breast epithelial cells , but these changes were significantly downregulated in metastatic breast tumor cells . We conclude that a non - malignant cell in the TME or at the wound edge would respond to ATP by increasing Ca 2 + that would cause the actin cortex to stabilize , while in metastatic tumorigenic cells this ATP wound signal is muted and their cortex is unchanged .

Bioinformatics The online cBioPortal ( RRID : SCR _ 014555 ) database ( https : / / www . cbioportal . org / ) was used to test whether P2Y2 mRNA expression had an effect on disease free survival in two different breast cancer datasets . The online Kaplan – Meier Plotter ( RRID : SCR _ 018753 ) database ( https : / / kmplot . com / analysis / ) was used to test whether P2Y2 mRNA expression had effects on breast cancer patient clinical outcome . The Gene symbol used was P2RY2 . Statistics Statistical analyses were conducted using two - tailed t - test , or one - way ANOVA with Dunnett’s or Holm - Sidak multiple comparison post - tests in GraphPad Prism 9 . 0 software ; P < 0 . 05 was considered significant . RESULTS : Extracellular ATP stimulates calcium signaling in normal and tumorigenic breast epithelial cells . Following up on previous work by the lab , we aimed to test adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) as a signaling molecule for intracellular calcium across multiple breast epithelial cell lines . 30 Since there are few studies that have focused on rapid calcium signaling in breast cancer , we wanted to measure signaling in tumorigenic cell lines as well . Time - lapsed images were captured with epifluorescence on a Nikon Ti2E microscope , and relative fluorescent units ( RFUs ) were measured in Nikon NIS - Elements software ( Supp . Figs . 1 - 3 ) . Representative images from those compressed videos were selected at specific time points : before and after ATP addition , 1 min , and 10 min ( Fig . 1A ) . We observed that non - tumorigenic MCF10A cells have a rapid and significant intracellular Ca 2 + response after 10mM ATP addition , indicated in green ( Fig . 1A ) . 10A - PTEN - / - KRas and MDA - MB - 231 cells both responded with intracellular calcium increases after ATP stimulation , but both failed to reach the increase in RFUs compared to non - tumorigenic MCF10A ( Fig . 1A ) . Whole - field change in fluorescence compared to baseline fluorescence ( △ F / F 0 ) as well as peak RFU were both greater in MCF10A cells after ATP treatment , while the two metastatic breast tumor cell lines showed a comparatively lower induction of cytoplasmic calcium after ATP addition ( Fig . 1B - D ) . Only MCF10A cells had a significant difference between ATP - treatment and control peak RFU , as well as MCF10A + ATP compared to MDA - MB - 231 + ATP ( Fig . 1E ) . When comparing all conditions and cell lines to one another , the MCF10A cells had a significantly greater intracellular Ca 2 + response than the two tumorigenic cell lines ( Fig . 1E ) . Overall , these results illustrate that stimulating breast epithelial cells with ATP leads to a rapid Ca 2 + response that is blunted in aggressive tumor cells . Intracellular Ca 2 + levels are inhibited in tumorigenic cells in response to ATP stimulation In order to confirm our results from Figure 1 showing ATP - induced intracellular Ca 2 + with epifluorescence microscopy , we used real - time quantitative plate reader measurements as an orthogonal approach . The increase in intracellular Ca 2 + response was also seen in the MCF10A cells treated with ATP in the FlexStation III ( Fig . 2A ) . The 10A - PTEN - / - KRas cells and MDA - MB - 231 cells showed a much smaller intracellular Ca 2 + response ( Fig . 2B - C ) . Area under the curve ( AUC ) measurements were performed and a one - way ANOVA with multiple comparisons was used to calculate significance ( Fig . 2D ) . Comparing all three cell types , we again saw a significant difference in Ca 2 + response from the MCF10A cells , while there were no significant changes in the metastatic cell lines ( Fig . 2D ) . These findings further indicate that the metastatic cells are unable to respond like a non - malignant cell and demonstrate that metastatic tumor cells have an inhibited intracellular Ca 2 + response compared to non - tumorigenic breast epithelial cells after ATP stimulation . P2Y2 receptor expression is lower at the mRNA and protein levels in tumorigenic cells compared to MCF10As . After showing by multiple measurements that the non - tumorigenic MCF10A cells increased intracellular Ca 2 + compared to metastatic cell lines , we wanted to investigate a potential mechanism responsible for this difference in our breast epithelial cell lines . We focused on our previous findings that extracellular ATP signals are conveyed through the purinergic receptor , P2Y2 , in breast epithelial tissue . 30 RNA sequencing data showed that P2Y2 expression is reduced nearly 8 - fold in the mutant 10A - PTEN - / - KRas cells as well as the 10A - KRas cell line ( Fig . 3A ) . The metastatic MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 436 cells from ATCC also showed a large fold - change in decreased P2Y2 mRNA expression compared to MCF10A cells ( Fig . 3A ) . After discovering the large decrease in P2Y2 mRNA , we examined protein expression in seven different tumorigenic and non - tumorigenic breast epithelial cell lines . P2Y2 protein expression appeared to be down in 10A - PTEN - / - KRas and MDA - MB - 436 cells but was significantly decreased in MDA - MB - 231 cells compared to MCF10A cells ( Fig . 3B ) . Densitometry shows that there is a significant reduction in P2Y2 protein expression in MDA - MB - 231 cells . While there was also a decrease in protein expression in the 10A - PTEN - / - KRas and MDA - MB - 436 cells it did not reach statistical significance ( Fig . 3C ) . These data show that there is a significant decrease in P2Y2 expression at the mRNA and protein level in metastatic MDA - MB - 231 cells . ATP - induced intracellular Ca 2 + response is inhibited by P2Y2 antagonist in breast epithelial cells . Previous work in our lab showed that AR - C118925XX , a P2Y2 antagonist that will be referred to as P2Y2i , was able to block a mechanically - induced calcium response in MCF10A and MDA - MB - 231 cells after scratch assays . 30 To test if P2Y2 receptors are involved in the differential response to ATP in mammary epithelial and breast tumor cells , we examined the effect of P2Y2i on ATP - stimulated Ca 2 + elevation . Cells were pre - treated with 10µM P2Y2i for 10 mins after loading with Fluo - 4 AM and time - lapsed imaging was performed similar to Figure 1 for all three cell lines . Figure 4A shows representative images from all three cells lines pre - and post - ATP addition , 1 min , and 10 min post - stimulation . Total field - of - view RFUs were analyzed in Nikon NIS - Elements , and graphed as △ F / F 0 control , ATP , or P2Y2i + ATP ( Fig . 4B - D ) . In Figure 4B , P2Y2i significantly suppresses the ATP response in MCF10A cells , while breast tumor cells ( Fig 4 . C , D ) are inhibited almost completely , similar to the control . Measuring peak RFU with one - way ANOVA statistical test , we found no significant differences in intracellular Ca 2 + changes over time among the three cell lines treated with P2Y2i compared to control ( Fig . 4E ) , indicating a complete suppression of the ATP - induced intracellular Ca 2 + with P2Y2i . These results demonstrate that MCF10A cells when treated with an antagonist for P2Y2 receptor and then stimulated with ATP , recapitulate a similar blunted Ca 2 + response to the metastatic breast cancer cells . Rapid changes in the actin cortex occur after ATP - induced calcium increases in breast epithelial cells . We have now shown that ATP via P2Y2 receptor can induce an intracellular Ca 2 + response in breast epithelial cells , while tumorigenic cells have a significantly lower response compared to MCF10A cells . What remained unknown , was the effect of that Ca 2 + signal on cell behavior that could impact responses to stress , wound healing , or the elevated ATP in the tumor microenvironment . It is well known that actin and Ca 2 + work closely together , which led us to explore changes in the actin network after ATP treatment . 31 We found that after treatment with 10µM ATP , MCF10A cells demonstrated a rapid actin reorganization that localizes at cell edges and junctions within 10 mins ( Fig . 5A , top panel ) . WGA was used to label the whole cell membrane . The same actin polymerization and localization was not seen in the 10A - PTEN - / - KRas or MDA - MB - 231 cells , supporting the idea that tumorigenic cells might not be responsive to normal wounding signals ( Fig . 5B , C , top panels ) . Similar to our results with P2Y2i in Figure 4 , we also show that P2Y2i prevents actin re - localization and polymerization after ATP stimulation in non - tumorigenic breast epithelial cells ( Fig . 5A , lower panel ) . The metastatic breast cancer cells show no major changes in actin after P2Y2i treatment and ATP stimulation ( Fig . 5B , C , lower panels ) . These data show that breast epithelial cells have changes in the actin cortex in response to rapid Ca 2 + signaling after ATP stimulation , which can be inhibited with P2Y2i , while the metastatic breast cancer cells lack a response . Low P2Y2 mRNA expression is correlated with decreased survival and disease - free progression in breast cancer patients . To further support our findings , we used bioinformatic tools to explore mRNA expression versus patient outcomes . Bioinformatic analysis showed strong correlation with poor survival and low disease - free outcomes in patients with reduced P2Y2 mRNA expressing tumors . Two cBioportal breast cancer datasets , the Invasive Breast Carcinoma ( TCGA , PanCancer Atlas ) and Firehose Legacy , also an invasive breast carcinoma , both showed significant correlation with low P2Y2 expression and smaller percent chance of disease - free survival ( Fig . 6A , B ) . 34 , 35 The independent KM Plot database also demonstrated that breast cancer patients , including all subtypes , with tumors showing reduced P2Y2 receptor have reduced overall survival probability ( Fig . 6C ) . 36 Additionally , this clinical data help support our findings that metastatic breast cancer cells with less P2Y2 receptor expression have a limited Ca 2 + response after ATP - activation . DISCUSSION : The tumor microenvironment ( TME ) is composed of many different cell types , and the role of non - malignant cells play a large factor in promoting tumors . 6 ATP is released into the TME from multiple cell types and has been found in extremely high concentrations in the extracellular tumor space . 8 , 37 ATP concentrations in the tumor interstitium have been found in the hundreds of micromolar , compared to normally undetectable levels in a non - malignant tissue . 8 Since it is well known that ATP is an activator of purinergic receptor signaling , multiple studies have investigated the role of purinergic receptors , such as the P2Y2 receptor , in wound healing . Boucher et al . found that P2Y2 receptor plays a key role in the response to corneal epithelial cell injury and repairs . 21 Just as our lab previously observed in breast epithelial cells , damage to the corneal epithelial cells caused a release of ATP and a stimulation of purinergic receptors ( P2Y2 ) , which subsequently lead to a Ca 2 + response . 21 , 30 Both groups also saw that the Ca 2 + signal could be blocked if the cells were pretreated with apyrase , while Boucher et al . found that the purinergic signaling also lead to phosphorylation of ERK . 21 Another group found that pharmacological inhibition of P2Y2 receptor , phospholipase C , and inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate receptor decreased wound closure in human keratinocytes . 38 A previously unknown mechanism was shown by a group in 2013 , indicating endothelial P2Y2 receptor involvement in cancer cell extravasation via activated platelet release of ATP . 39 Purinergic receptor signaling in breast cancer is a unique niche , where a few groups have found involvement of ATP - activated P2Y2 receptor and relatively long - term cancer phenotypes that occur over hours to days , like epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , migration , and invasion . 18 , 20 , 29 , 40 , 41 Davis et al . found that initiation of EMT using endothelial growth factor in MDA - MB - 436 breast cancer cells caused an increase in vimentin at 24 hours . 18 Using RT - PCR , they found that P2X5 mRNA expression was increased in their cells and also found changes in Ca 2 + signaling via ATP stimulation with increased vimentin . 18 Parallel to that , here , we have identified differences in intracellular Ca 2 + response after ATP - activated P2Y2 receptor signaling in metastatic breast cancer cells with oncogenic KRas mutations compared to non - malignant breast epithelial cells . The purpose of our study was to investigate the more rapid phenotypes that occur within seconds to minutes , that could potentially lead to those later changes in migration and invasion . We next sought to find what might play a role in these Ca 2 + response differences . Previous work led us to P2Y2 receptors , and while there is some variation in P2Y2 protein expression levels across breast epithelial cells and breast cancer lines , we saw a decrease in P2Y2 mRNA and protein in MDA - MB - 23 cells compared to our MCF10A cell line . 40 , 42 The metastatic breast cancer cells might not respond to our ATP signal due to their significantly decreased mRNA and protein expression of P2Y2 receptor , thereby suppressing Ca 2 + flux within the cytoplasm . Calcium concentration in the cytoplasm is normally around 100nM , while extracellular Ca 2 + is much higher in the mM range . 43 The field of calcium signaling in cancer is mainly focused on aberrant gene expression due to changes in Ca 2 + concentrations or protein expression of receptors causing differences in Ca 2 + concentrations . 43 – 45 We , and others , have now shown differences in P2Y2 receptor expression , but we are also focused on those rapid Ca 2 + changes and how the cell responds within seconds . As previously studied , the role of Ca 2 + and the actin cortex has been well established in muscle , bone , and cardiac research . 46 The rapid polymerization and localization of actin in response to ATP - stimulated Ca 2 + increase is a normal cell response to wounding . Oppositely , cancerous cells with lower P2Y2 expression would not respond normally to ATP , and therefore yield minimal flux of Ca 2 + with no actin polymerization . It would be advantageous for breast cancer cells to not respond or become desensitized to the high ATP concentrations in the TME and continue to migrate out of the primary tumor . Since the P2Y2 receptor is part of the large family of purinergic receptors , there are a few drugs developed to target it or its family members . AR - C118925 is a potent and specific antagonist of the P2Y2 receptor . 47 The drug was developed using UTP agonist as the base and is relatively new . 47 Thus far , only a few P2Y2 drugs are being used clinically . Diquafosol is a P2Y2 receptor agonist that has been used as treatment for dry eye disease , since P2Y2 is expressed in the epithelium of the eye . 48 Another antagonist for P2Y and P2X receptors is the non - selective drug Suramin . 49 It has most commonly and consistently been used as a treatment for human sleeping sickness , but also has applications for viral disease like HIV and hepatitis , as well as studies looking at autism , snakebites , and cancer . 49 Unfortunately , it is extremely indiscriminate and has a multitude of targets from DNA and RNA synthesis , sirtuins , protein kinases , tyrosine phosphatases , ATPases , GABA receptors , etc . 49 There was even one clinical trial for suramin and paclitaxel in women with stage IIB - IV breast cancer from 2003 to 2015 . The goal was to give the drugs in combination and to assess the best dose of suramin that might increase the effectiveness of paclitaxel by sensitizing the tumor cells . 50 They found that suramin at non - toxic doses in combination with paclitaxel given weekly , was tolerated well by metastatic breast cancer patients , but the efficacy did not meet the criteria essential to rationalize further investigation . 50 Purinergic receptors are such a large family that drugs must be specific to avoid as many off target effects as possible . A P2Y2 antagonist might not be the best choice in metastatic breast cancer cells with low expression of P2Y2 receptor compared to non - tumorigenic breast epithelial . Even in tumor cells with normal or elevated P2Y2 receptor expression , our results indicate treatment with a P2Y2i would be predicted to reduce actin - dependent reinforcement of cell junctions in the presence of ATP , which could inadvertently induce tumor cell dissemination . There may be potential use for a P2Y2 agonist if that could play a role in sensitizing the cells to ATP and signaling an intracellular Ca 2 + response . In summary , our results demonstrate that metastatic breast cancer cells have a suppressed intracellular Ca 2 + response to ATP - stimulated P2Y2 receptor signaling compared to non - malignant breast epithelial cells . Further research into the rapid phenotypes occurring after P2Y2 activation could help elucidate better mechanisms for drug therapy and deeper understanding of how cancerous cells evade normal cellular responses .
