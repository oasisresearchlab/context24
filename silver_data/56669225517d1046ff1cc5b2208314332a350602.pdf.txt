Deciphering how these processes are regulated and coordinated to generate form and function is therefore complex . Historically , the first insights were inspired by descriptive observations of embryos developing in vitro . Wilhelm Roux realized the need to establish causality or , in other words , determine the effects of experimental manipulations on nor - mal development 1 , a notion that pioneered the field of experimen - tal embryology . From initial cell separation 2 and transplantation experiments into the generation of chimaeras 3 , 4 and the creation of genetically modified organisms 5 – 7 , the use of experimental embryol - ogy techniques to study mammalian embryos has led to the estab - lishment of a number of key developmental principles . This method can be thought of as a ‘top - down’ approach , with the starting point being the embryo , which is deconstructed to its constituent pieces through experimental manipulation ( Fig . 1 ) . The alternative way to verify a basic developmental principle that applies to a complex organism would be to construct a simple system based on that principle , an approach inspired by the field of synthetic biology 8 . The core concept of this reductionist ‘bottom - up’ approach is the use of individual blocks ( for example , stem cells ) to build simplified in vitro models of real embryos , so - called embry - oids or synthetic embryos . Although this idea was already intro - duced at the beginning of the twentieth century , it has been revived over the past years and the number of embryo stem cell models is growing . These simplified models are highly relevant for the study of mammalian development , in particular for the early phases of post - implantation development when embryos become inaccessible for visualisation and experimentation . Moreover , ethical guidelines limit the developmental timeframe in which human embryos are amenable to scientific study in the laboratory 9 . In this Review , we will discuss top - down strategies and innova - tions used to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape mouse and human post - implantation embryos , as well as bot - tom - up approaches devised to reconstruct embryos using stem cells . Elucidating early development in the mouse Experiments in the 1950s have pioneered the establishment of in vitro culture methods for mouse pre - implantation embryos 10 , 11 . These methods were optimized and simplified , leading to the gen - eration of the standard medium used today 12 that allows embryo development up to the blastocyst stage ( embryonic day E4 . 5 ) . With these culture techniques in place , methods were developed to manipulate gene expression during embryo development 5 , 6 , 13 , 14 , resulting in the discovery of specific developmental gene func - tions 15 ( Fig . 1 ) . In combination with long - term time - lapse imag - ing , which allows the tracking of individual cell dynamics in living embryos 16 – 19 , these improved methodologies led to an understand - ing of how the blastocyst is formed and how its lineages are speci - fied . These lineages are the embryonic epiblast ( precursor to the future fetus ) and two extra - embryonic epithelial tissues , the primi - tive endoderm and trophectoderm ( precursors of the yolk sac and placenta , respectively ) 20 . Together , these techniques have shaped current understanding of the first days of mammalian development , the so - called pre - implantation stage . The mouse blastocyst implants into the uterus at E4 . 75 – 5 . 0 ( ref . 21 ) . Implantation marks the initiation of a series of morpho - genetic reorganizations and changes in stem cell identity that set the stage for establishment of the body plan 22 . However , given the small size of the implanting embryo and its inaccessibility in the uterus , the sequence of events during this period has remained largely unexplored , and hence this stage was coined the black box of development 23 . The analysis of mouse embryos recovered at successive developmental stages in combination with the genera - tion of knockout models 15 provided an opportunity to study the signalling interactions and cellular mechanisms involved in post - implantation morphogenesis . Following implantation , the apolar epiblast transforms into a cup - shaped epithelial tissue that flanks an emergent luminal space , the pro - amniotic cavity 22 . The polar ( embryonic ) trophectoderm forms the extra - embryonic ectoderm , which is adjacent to the epiblast and contains trophoblast stem cells ( TSCs ) 24 . These cells will go on to form the mature placenta , and during the first days of post - implantation development they will generate structures such as the ectoplacental cone . The mural ( abembryonic ) trophectoderm gives rise to terminally differenti - ated trophoblast giant cells , which are required during implantation of the embryo 24 . The primitive endoderm forms the differentiated parietal endoderm cells and the visceral endoderm , which develops to envelop both the epiblast and the extra - embryonic ectoderm 22 ( Figs . 2 , 3 ) . The extra - embryonic tissues play a key role in pat - terning during post - implantation development , and the crosstalk established between embryonic and extra - embryonic cells breaks Deconstructing and reconstructing the mouse and human early embryo Marta N . Shahbazi * and Magdalena Zernicka - Goetz * The emergence of form and function during mammalian embryogenesis is a complex process that involves multiple regulatory levels . The foundations of the body plan are laid throughout the first days of post - implantation development as embryonic stem cells undergo symmetry breaking and initiate lineage specification , in a process that coincides with a global morphological reor - ganization of the embryo . Here , we review experimental models and how they have shaped our current understanding of the post - implantation mammalian embryo .

We will summarize this process in the paragraph below , and for additional details see refs 15 , 21 , 25 – 27 . As the embryo implants and starts to grow , the extra - embryonic ectoderm secretes proteases Furin and Pace that promote the mat - uration of Nodal protein , which is secreted from the epiblast 28 . In turn , Nodal leads to BMP4 expression in the extra - embryonic ecto - derm , which activates Wnt3 in the epiblast and further amplifies Nodal signalling 29 . Concomitantly , a discrete population of visceral endoderm cells is specified in the distal part of the embryo ( distal visceral endoderm , DVE ) , which subsequently migrates toward the extra - embryonic ectoderm , marking the future anterior domain 30 , 31 . These anterior visceral endoderm ( AVE ) cells secrete Wnt and Nodal antagonists , therefore creating an anterior – posterior gradient of Wnt and Nodal activity that leads to specification of the primi - tive streak in the posterior epiblast and the onset of gastrulation by E6 . 5 ( ref . 32 ) . Posterior epiblast cells initiate expression of mesoderm markers , undergo epithelial - to - mesenchymal ( EMT ) transition and ingress through the primitive streak to form mesoderm and defini - tive endoderm 15 . In addition , extra - embryonic ectoderm - derived BMP signals lead to the induction of 4 to 8 primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) in pre - streak posterior epiblast cells 33 , 34 . Despite this overall basic understanding of the signalling cross - talk between the embryonic and extra - embryonic tissues , many fundamental questions have remained unanswered . What are the morphogenetic events that take place in the implanting embryo ? How are they regulated at the cellular and molecular level ? What are the transcriptional and epigenetic changes that drive these morphogenetic transformations ? What is the influence of the uter - ine environment or , alternatively , are these morphogenetic events embryo autonomous ? Thanks to the development of methods to culture mammalian embryos in vitro beyond implantation , we are just beginning to address these questions . Several studies in the 1970s indicated that mouse blastocysts have the intrinsic ability to undergo post - implantation morphogenesis in vitro 35 – 39 . These culture methods varied in complexity , composition and substrate used , and were not commonly adopted in the field . The first systems relied on collagen gels 35 , 36 and lens explants 37 , 40 to promote attachment , but later successful development was also reported on plastic dishes 38 , 39 , 41 or in co - culture with uterine cells 42 . Advancing these methodologies and coupling them with high - res - olution time - lapse imaging 43 – 45 has led to discovery of the morpho - genetic events that shape the epiblast , leading to its polarization and formation of the pro - amniotic cavity at the transition from pre - to post - implantation 45 . Epiblast cells polarize in response to β 1 - integrin signalling , which is initiated by interactions with the extra - cellular matrix secreted by extra - embryonic tissues 46 . This polarization transforms the epiblast into a transitory rosette - like structure that undergoes lumenogenesis to form the pro - amniotic cavity 45 .

Whereas the transformation of the epiblast has now been largely uncovered , the cellular and molecular mechanisms that reshape the extra - embryonic tissues still await discovery . Another breakthrough has been the development of single - cell technologies , which allow developmental biologists to study cell - fate decisions at the single - cell level in an embryonic context 48 . This approach has been particularly useful in identifying events lead - ing to lineage specification 49 and differential allelic gene expres - sion 50 , 51 . Single - cell sequencing studies also led to the discovery that molecular differences are already present between individual cells of 2 - cell stage and 4 - cell stage embryos , and that lineage specifi - cation is affected by this cellular heterogeneity 18 , 19 , 52 – 54 . In addition , the route from pluripotency establishment at the blastocyst stage ( E4 . 5 ) to lineage commitment at gastrulation ( E7 . 5 ) can now be effi - ciently followed 55 – 57 ( Fig . 3 ) . During these three days , epiblast cells are pluripotent and able to form any cell type of the fetus . However , epiblast cells exhibit marked transcriptional , epigenetic and meta - bolic differences that define distinct pluripotent states , from the naive epiblast of unrestricted potential at E4 . 5 to the lineage - biased primed pluripotent state characteristic of the E6 . 5 – E7 . 5 epiblast 58 – 60 . These pluripotent state transitions are drivers of epiblast morpho - genesis and formation of the pro - amniotic cavity 61 . Mouse blas - tocysts may be locked in the naive pluripotent state in a state of dormancy , known as diapause , which can be mimicked in vitro by inhibiting proliferation or downregulating the metabolic activity of the blastocyst 62 , 63 . We are just beginning to open the black box of implantation development . Our understanding of the complex interplay between tissue morphogenesis and cell fate specification , as well as the inter - cellular communication between distinct tissue types , is still far M ou se H u m a n E4 . 5 E7 Implantation ( mural TE ) Implantation ( polar TE ) E5 . 0 Epiblast polarization and cavity formation E5 . 5 Extra - embryonic cavity formation DVE specification DVE / AVE migration Epiblast polarization and lumenogenesis Amnion specification and amniotic cavity formation E9 E11 Yolk sac formation E6 . 5 Symmetrybreaking ?

By E4 . 5 in mice and E7 in humans , the blastocyst is ready to implant into the uterus . At this stage it is composed of one embryonic tissue , the naive pluripotent epiblast , and two extra - embryonic tissues , trophectoderm and primitive endoderm ( mouse ) or hypoblast ( human ) . Implantation is initiated through the abembryonic trophectoderm ( mural ) in the mouse or the embryonic trophectoderm ( polar ) in the human embryo . On exit from naive pluripotency and in response to the extracellular matrix secreted by the extra - embryonic tissues , the epiblast undergoes a process of polarization , rosette formation and subsequent lumenogenesis . In the mouse embryo , by E5 . 5 the polar trophectoderm has formed the extra - embryonic ectoderm , which is contiguous to the epiblast and undergoes lumen formation . The fusion of the extra - embryonic ectoderm and epiblast cavities generates the pro - amniotic cavity . Both tissues are surrounded by the visceral endoderm derived from the primitive endoderm . The primitive endoderm also forms the parietal endoderm , which is adjacent to trophoblast giant cells derived from the mural trophectoderm . A subset of visceral endoderm cells is specified as DVE and AVE , which migrate towards the epiblast – extra - embryonic - ectoderm boundary to determine the future anterior side of the embryo . By E6 . 5 , in the posterior epiblast the primitive streak is formed , gastrulation is initiated and PGCs become specified at the boundary between the posterior epiblast and the extra - embryonic ectoderm . By contrast , during early post - implantation development of human embryos a subset of epiblast cells becomes specified as extra - embryonic amnion and the pluripotent epiblast acquires a disc shape . By E11 the hypoblast has formed a prospective yolk sac and the trophectoderm has differentiated into cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast . By E14 gastrulation is initiated in the posterior epiblast . In monkey embryos , PGCs are specified in a population of amniotic cells , but whether this is also the case in human embryos remains to be determined . TE , trophectoderm .

A more comprehensive knowledge of these pro - cesses may be achieved using in vitro models of the embryo , as discussed in the following section . Stem cell models of the mouse embryo Soon after the derivation of mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) in 1981 ( refs 64 , 65 ) , their potential to mimic embryogenesis was tested through formation of three - dimensional ( 3D ) aggregates called embryoid bodies ( EBs ) 66 . This work was based on experiments investigating the developmental potential and differentiation capa - bilities of embryonic carcinoma cells 67 , 68 . EBs became a widely used tool to explore the mechanisms of cell fate specification and differ - entiation , and to direct ESCs into specific developmental lineages 69 . At that point it was unclear whether these lineage specification events in EBs occurred in an organized manner . The pioneering work of ten Berge et al . led to the conclusion that self - organizing morphogen gradients can be established in EBs , leading to polar - ized Wnt signalling and mesoderm specification 70 . More recently EBs have been used to generate organ - like structures , termed organ - oids 71 , 72 , and embryo - like structures , or embryoids 73 – 76 . These mod - els share the intrinsic symmetry - breaking events that likely arise as a consequence of fluctuations in gene expression , which are ampli - fied under appropriate experimental conditions 77 . These spontane - ous symmetry - breaking events 70 can be generated more robustly by providing a short pulse of the GSK3 inhibitor ( Wnt activator ) Chiron 73 , 76 during a precise time window . Under these conditions EBs can develop to establish distinctive gene expression domains suggestive of germ layer specification 73 ( Fig . 4 ) . EB - derived embry - oids are very valuable tools to study self - organization and lineage specification , but they do not recapitulate the initial morphogenetic steps of the epiblast , such as polarization into a 3D rosette struc - ture that undergoes lumenogenesis 45 . Inspired by the fundamental discoveries of Mina Bissell and Keith Mostov , among others 78 – 81 , we recently showed that individual ESCs cultured in a 3D matrix recapitulate the processes of cell polarization , rosette formation and lumenogenesis through vesicular exocytosis , following naive pluripotency exit 45 , 61 . When the chemical , physical and mechanical properties of the 3D matrix are controlled , a self - organized circu - lar arrangement of gene expression is generated as a consequence of differential cell adhesion and cortical tension 82 . Globally , these studies highlight an intrinsic ability of ESCs to self - organize and generate patterns 83 . The derivation of stem cells more akin to the post - implantation epiblast represents another interesting avenue that might help to explore the molecular mechanisms of cell lineage allocation and pluripotent state transitions . Culture of post - implantation epiblasts in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 2 ( Fgf2 ) and Activin - A generates epiblast stem cells ( Epi SCs ) , which capture a lineage - biased , primed pluripotent state similar to the E6 . 5 – E7 . 5 epiblast 84 – 86 ( Fig . 3 ) . When mouse ESCs are cultured in this medium they acquire a transitory E5 . 5 - like formative pluripotent state 87 , 88 .

When EpiLCs are grown in micropatterns of a defined size they generate a circular arrangement of cellular fates that can be modulated by changing the external growth - factor environment 89 . Self - renewing stem cell lines representative of the extra - embry - onic tissues of the mouse embryo have also been established ( Fig . 3 ) . Extra - embryonic endoderm ( XEN ) cells represent the stem cell population of the primitive endoderm , but they are molecularly and functionally more similar to the parietal endoderm than the visceral endoderm 90 . TSCs derived from mouse blastocysts repre - sent the stem cell population of the extra - embryonic ectoderm 91 . Recently , it has been shown that fostering the self - assembly of TSCs and ESCs in a 3D matrix leads to generation of embryo - like structures , which recapitulate the morphogenesis of early post - implantation embryos including pro - amniotic cavity formation , and undergo symmetry breaking and specification of mesoderm and PGC - like cells 92 ( Fig . 4 ) . Mixing ESCs and TSCs has also led to development of structures morphologically and transcriptionally similar to mouse blastocysts 93 . These blastoids can also be generated by reprogramming primed cells into the naive state 94 , but in both cases they do not robustly develop to post - implantation stages—at least not at present . Most recently , complete embryo - like structures composed of ESCs , TSCs and XEN cells have been generated 95 that establish all three tissues : ESC - derived epiblast , TSC - derived extra - embryonic ectoderm and XEN - derived visceral endoderm . These embryo - like structures initiate EMT and gastrulation , which leads to the specification of mesoderm and definitive endoderm - like cells , and globally to the acquisition of a gene expression signature similar to E7 . 0 mid - gastrula stage embryos 95 , 96 . An important conclusion that can be drawn from these studies is that ESCs have the potential to undergo patterning events in vitro . A comparison of the different in vitro models of embryogenesis gen - erated so far , may help to reveal the role of extra - embryonic tissues in directing the self - organizing capabilities of ESCs .

Blastoids , a suspension culture of mouse ESCs and TSCs leads to the generation of structures transcriptionally and morphologically similar to the blastocyst . Reprogramming of primed pluripotent cells into naive conditions can also generate blastocyst - like structures with embryonic and trophoblast lineages . Mouse epiblast - like structures , ESCs cultured in 3D Matrigel recapitulate the formation of rosettes that evolve to form a luminal cavity . In polarized EBs , aggregates of ESCs , known as EBs , undergo a process of symmetry breaking , specify a region of mesoderm , and form a primitive streak - like domain . EB - derived gastruloids , under appropriate experimental conditions EBs are able to elongate and specify ectoderm - like , mesoderm - like and endoderm - like domains . The resulting structures are thus called gastruloids . Organized germ layers , ESC rosettes evolve to generate organized germ layers when cultured in a scaffold of defined physical properties . Patterned EpiLC colonies , EpiLCs cultured in micropatterns of a defined size generate a radial organization of cellular fates . Different combinations of growth factors and inhibitors lead to distinct cell fate patterning . The diagram depicts cellular identities observed in a medium containing Activin - A , Wnt3a , Fgf2 and Bmp4 . Polarized embryo - like structures , co - culture of ESCs and TSCs in 3D Matrigel generates composite structures that specify mesoderm and PGC - like cells at the extra - embryonic – embryonic boundary . Gastrulating embryo - like structures , a suspension culture of ESCs , TSCS and XEN cells leads to the generation of structures that morphologically and transcriptionally resemble E7 . 0 mouse embryos . Human epiblast - like structures , human ESCs cultured in 3D Matrigel recapitulate the formation of a luminal cavity . Post - implantation amniotic sac embryoids , human epiblast - like structures break symmetry and generate amnion - like cells and an epiblast - like region that undergoes EMT . Patterned human ESC colonies , ESC confinement in the presence of BMP4 generates a circular arrangement of cellular fates , mimicking the generation of embryonic germ layers . In this model , treatment with WNT3A and ACTIVIN - A leads to the formation of a gastrula organizer .

Elucidating early development in the human The first month of human development has remained elusive for decades . A major breakthrough in our understanding of human embryogenesis came from the work of John Rock , Miriam Menkin and Landrum Shettles , in the United States , and Robert Edwards , Barry Bavister and Patrick Steptoe , in the UK , who reported the in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) of a human egg 97 , 98 ( Fig . 1 ) . Refined culture conditions endowed the resulting zygotes with the ability to cleave , blastulate and hatch 99 , 100 . As a result , the first seven days of human embryogenesis became accessible to observation and experimenta - tion . The use of surplus donated IVF human embryos , in combina - tion with single - cell profiling , has permitted researchers to describe major events in human pre - implantation development , including embryonic genome activation and cell lineage allocation 101 – 106 . The recent application of genome - editing technology further revealed the function of early developmental genes ; such as the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 ( ref . 107 ) . On day 7 , the human blastocyst , composed of the embryonic epiblast and two extra - embryonic epi - thelial tissues , primitive endoderm ( hypoblast ) and trophectoderm , is ready to implant in the maternal uterus 108 . Although failure to implant represents one of the main causes of early pregnancy loss and an important limitation of assisted reproductive techniques 109 , our understanding of human implantation morphogenesis is scant given the technical difficulties in studying human embryos beyond day 7 . In this context , a number of studies have reported successful co - culture of human blastocysts with endometrial cells beyond day 7 ( refs 110 , 111 ) . This approach represents a valuable tool to determine the signalling crosstalk between the endometrium and the embryo at the time of implantation . However , whether human embryos undergo proper post - implantation morphogenesis in these settings remains unexplored . Due to these difficulties , the knowledge of early human post - implantation morphogenesis has been based on the contributions of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , which has collected and described samples of in vivo developing human embryos since 1914 ( refs 112 – 114 ) . These observations have established that following implantation ( day 7 – 8 ) , an amniotic cavity is formed within the epi - blast , which organizes into a polarized rosette - like structure , resem - bling the process of pro - amniotic cavity formation in the mouse 45 . However , although both mouse and human epiblasts develop simi - larly and form a pseudostratified columnar epithelium , the mouse epiblast acquires a cylinder - like morphology and the human epi - blast forms a disc . More importantly , in human embryos , epiblast cells adjacent to the trophoblast are specified to form a squamous epithelium known as the amnion 112 ( Figs . 2 , 3 ) . The trophectoderm at the embryonic pole , which mediates implantation of the embryo into the uterus , transforms into the villous cytotrophoblast . This tis - sue harbours bipotent stem cells that give rise to the differentiated extravillous cytotrophoblast ( which infiltrates the maternal decidua ) and the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast ( which forms lacunar spaces to allow the supply of maternal blood ) ( day 11 – 12 ) 115 , 116 . At this stage a definitive yolk sac , derived from the hypoblast , can be observed 117 . This is in contrast to the mouse , where the mural troph - ectoderm mediates implantation of the embryo into the uterus , the polar trophectoderm gives rise to the extra - embryonic ectoderm , and both amnion and yolk sac are formed at the time of gastru - lation 118 . By day 14 of human embryogenesis , the primitive streak emerges , gastrulation is initiated and PGCs are specified 119 . These major morphogenetic transformations have also been observed in Rhesus monkey embryos 120 , highlighting a high degree of similarity in the early post - implantation embryogenesis of higher primates 121 . The work of Patrick Luckett and Allen Enders , among others , established the basic anatomy of early post - implantation Rhesus monkey embryos , including yolk sac development , extra - embryonic mesenchyme formation , and amnion specification and cavitation 117 , 120 , 122 , 123 . In cynomolgus monkeys PGCs were shown to originate from the amnion prior to gastrulation 124 , whereas in por - cine embryos PGCs are specified at the posterior epiblast 125 . Despite this divergence , the mechanisms of PGC specification described in both species , and in PGC - like cells 125 – 127 , seem to be conserved 124 , 125 . Analyses of Carnegie stage human embryos revealed the presence of PGCs in the yolk sac at E24 ( ref . 119 ) . However , where exactly human PGCs are specified , remains unknown . The establishment of a culture system allowing human embryo development beyond implantation would open the doors to explore the basic mechanisms of human post - implantation morphogen - esis . Embryos cultured in these settings should undergo the major morphogenetic events of early post - implantation morphogenesis , namely : lineage segregation , amniotic cavitation , trophoblast dif - ferentiation , yolk sac formation and amnion specification ( Fig . 2 ) . Based on the self - organizing capabilities of mouse embryos 43 , it was plausible to hypothesize that early human post - implantation morphogenesis could happen in the absence of maternal tis - sues , and thus in an embryo - autonomous fashion . Together with the Brivanlou laboratory at the Rockefeller University , New York , we used an experimental protocol and culture media previously developed for mouse embryos 43 to show that human embryos can attach , survive and develop under these conditions 128 , 129 . Moreover , approximately 30 % of the developing embryos displayed the major hallmarks of post - implantation morphogenesis up to day 12 – 13 ( ref . 128 , 129 ) . This in vitro method provides a powerful tool to under - stand the mechanisms of early human embryogenesis , causes of early pregnancy loss and the biology of human ESCs in the physi - ological context of the embryo . However , it also raises fundamen - tal questions about the limits of the self - organising capabilities of human embryos . Would the presence of endometrial cells and / or a 3D scaffold affect the morphogenesis of the embryo ? What are the transcriptional and epigenetic regulators in different cell types as the embryo undergoes morphogenesis ? A study in cynomolgus monkeys has identified global transcriptional changes in the epi - blast as the embryo implants in the uterus 130 . These changes are sug - gestive of a pluripotent state transition in the implanting epiblast 130 , similar to what has been described in mouse embryos 56 , 57 , 88 although timing and identity of the involved genes differ . In favour of such a pluripotent state transition , evidence suggests that if human embryos are blocked in the naive pluripotent state , amniotic cavita - tion is impaired 61 . However , the cellular and molecular mechanisms that trigger exit from pluripotency and cell lineage specification in human embryos are unknown . Advances in culture 128 , 129 and genome editing of human embryos 107 , 131 – 133 provide a unique opportunity to investigate gene function at the time of implantation , when the embryo needs to undergo a dramatic reorganization and many pregnancies fail . However , it has to be noted that these studies are limited to the first 7 days of post - implantation development . The 14 - day rule estab - lishes a legal limit for in vitro culture of human embryos in many countries , including the UK . This rule mandates that embryos can be cultured up to day 14 of development , or until the appearance of the first signs of primitive streak formation , whichever event takes place first 9 . Thus , at present , the mechanisms of cell fate specifi - cation at gastrulation cannot be studied in the context of in vitro human embryo culture . However , alternative models to study post - implantation human embryogenesis are being explored . For exam - ple , human ESCs have been shown to be able to colonize mouse embryos as well as embryos of other non - rodent species , differen - tiating into the three germ layers—thereby generating interspecies chimaeras 134 – 137 . This approach allows the investigation of human cell lineage allocation in vivo . Other strategies are based on the gen - eration of in vitro stem cell - derived models that recapitulate certain NaturE CEll BioloGy | VOL 20 | AUGUST 2018 | 878 – 887 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 883 Review ARticle NaTure Cell Biology aspects of human embryogenesis . In the next section we will discuss the efforts to mimic human embryogenesis using stem cells . Stem cell models of the human embryo Since the initial derivation of human ESCs in 1998 ( ref . 138 ) , exten - sive efforts have been made to devise robust differentiation proto - cols to generate homogenous cell populations for regeneration 69 . As in the mouse , the first approximation to investigate whether human ESCs are capable of self - organising was the generation of EBs ( ref . 139 ) , which contain representative cell types of the three germ layers . Subsequent work showed that EBs can develop to specify gastrula organizer cells 140 and , given the appropriate signals , they can be directed to form complex organoids in vitro 141 , 142 . However , in doing so they do not reproduce the spatial patterning of the post - implantation human embryo 77 . Hence , the question remained of how to exploit the self - organizing capabilities of human ESCs to mimic embryogenesis . A hint that this could be possible came from studies of non - human primate ESCs , which showed an intrinsic capability to form post - implantation - like structures in vitro 143 , 144 . The use of circular micropatterns has shown that self - organizing patterns of human ESCs can be induced by confinement 145 ( Fig . 3 ) . A geometri - cally controlled culture and a chemical cue ( bone morphogenic pro - tein 4 , BMP4 ) are sufficient to generate ring - like arrangements of different cellular fates , similar to those observed at gastrulation 145 , 146 . This self - organizing pattern emerges as a consequence of the inter - play between receptor localization ( and thus accessibility to the ligand ) and production of the BMP - inhibitor Noggin 147 . Exposure of such micropatterned colonies to ACTIVIN - A and WNT3A leads to the formation of a structure equivalent to the human orga - nizer 148 . This system represents an in vitro model ideally suited to decipher the complex interplay between signalling , fate and shape , as well as explore symmetry - breaking events and the self - organizing properties of pluripotent stem cells . It lacks , however , some of the key morphological features of the early post - implantation human embryo , such as formation of the amnion and amniotic cavity . Recent reports have shown that amniotic - cavity - formation can be recapitulated using human ESCs by addition of a 3D extracellular matrix 128 , 149 . Moreover , these structures undergo spontaneous sym - metry - breaking , forming a squamous amniotic epithelium that is contiguous to an epiblast columnar epithelium 150 , 151 , as observed in early post - implantation human embryos 112 . They also initiate gas - trulation - like events , such as mesoderm specification and upregu - lation of EMT transcription factors 151 . Interestingly , these events appear to be controlled by a gradient of BMP4 ( ref . 151 ) , in agree - ment with observations in monkey embryos 124 . However , in con - trast to the micropattern technology , formation of these embryoids is currently less efficient and robust . These models are just the beginning of a surge of interest in synthetic embryo research . There are still a number of unresolved questions , technical difficulties and ethical concerns that await future investigation . First , the initial culture parameters may have a profound impact in the final outcome . It is becoming increasingly apparent that ESCs can be maintained in different pluripotent states in vitro by modifying culture conditions 135 , 152 – 160 , and these states may endow cells with different functionalities 126 . Secondly , the contribution of extra - embryonic tissues to the development of the human epiblast remains to be determined . The derivation of human TSCs ( ref . 115 ) and generation of human ESCs with embryonic and extra - embryonic potential 161 may be useful tools to generate orga - nized structures comprising both embryonic and extra - embryonic lineages . The third aspect to take into consideration is reproduc - ibility . Devising robust protocols will help to obtain quantitative measurements and to assess gene function 77 . The fourth issue relates to the lack of an appropriate in vivo control . Given that human embryos can only be cultured in vitro until day 14 and prior to the appearance of the primitive streak 9 , our knowledge of human gastrulation is limited to a few electron microscopy images of embryos developing in vivo 112 . This limitation could be partially overcome by the use of non - human primate embryos , which dis - play a similar developmental program to humans , both in terms of morphogenesis and gene expression 56 , 124 , 125 , 130 . Finally , the genera - tion of synthetic human embryo - like structures raises a number of fundamental ethical questions that need to be carefully evaluated 162 . Given the numerous potential scientific and clinical benefits of this research , such as improving ESC differentiation protocols or deciphering the causes of early pregnancy loss , it is important that updated guidelines and limits should be established to enable scien - tific progress within an ethical and legal framework . Future perspectives The study of embryo development has been shaped by the concepts of experimental embryology . This top - down approach contrasts with the recent generation of stem cell models of the embryo . In this exciting time for developmental biologists , we envisage that by com - bining studies on natural and synthetic embryo - like structures , we will be able to unravel the basic principles of human development . There are still a number of key elements that need further investiga - tion in the coming years , such as : use of physically and chemically defined , and tuneable , 3D matrices 163 as an alternative to sarcoma - derived Matrigel ; establishment of human embryonic and extra - embryonic stem cell lines , which may be used to produce improved forms of human synthetic embryo - like structures ; generation of more complex in vitro culture systems for human embryos that can mimic the 3D uterine environment ; use of non - human primates as an in vivo reference for characterization of synthetic human embryos ; broad application of CRISPR – Cas9 technology to study gene function during human embryogenesis ; and , finally , further development of long - term high - resolution 4D imaging techniques to analyse cellular behaviours as embryos start to grow . Working with synthetic embryo - like structures has the main advantages of scalability , ease of genetic manipulation , accessibility and the possibility to finely control a limited number of variables or elements . For these reasons , we envisage that they will become a fundamental model to decipher the cellular and molecular prin - ciples of mammalian development . However , it is important to keep in mind that mimicking embryogenesis in vitro using stem cells generates simplified models of the real embryo , which do not reca - pitulate the whole complexity of developing organisms . Hence , to comprehend the development of form and function , constructing synthetic embryos will complement deconstructing natural ones .
