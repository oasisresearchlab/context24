A number of these effectors modulate organelle trafficking 16 pathways to create a membrane - bound niche called the Legionella containing vacuole 17 ( LCV ) . In this study , we found that L . pneumophila induces F - actin accumulation in host 18 cell cortex by its Dot / Icm substrate RavJ ( Lpg0944 ) . RavJ harbors an C 101 H 138 D 170 motif 19 associated with human tissue transglutaminases ( TGs ) . We showed that RavJ catalyzes 20 a covalent linkage between actin and the Motin family proteins Angiomotin ( AMOT ) and 21 Angiomotin - like 1 ( AMOTL1 ) , proteins known to regulate tube formation and cell 22 migration . Further study revealed that RavJ - induced crosslink between actin and AMOT 23 occurs on its Gln 354 residue . Crosslink between actin and AMOT significantly reduces the 24 binding between actin and its binding partner cofilin , suggesting that RavJ inhibits actin 25 depolymerization . We also demonstrated that the metaeffector LegL1 directly interacts 26 with RavJ to antagonize its transglutaminase activity , leading to reduced crosslink 27 between actin and Motin proteins . Our results reveal a novel mechanism of modulating 28 the host actin cytoskeleton by L . pneumophila . 29 30 3 Introduction 31 Legionella pneumophila is a Gram - negative intracellular pathogen that causes 32 Legionnaires’ disease in humans [ 1 ] . Successful colonization by this bacteria requires its 33 ability to manipulate such diverse processes of host cells as membrane trafficking , 34 immunity , protein translation , autophagy , gene expression , and cytoskeleton structure [ 2 , 35 3 ] . Upon entry into host cells , L . pneumophila promotes the biogenesis of a phagosome 36 structure called the Legionella - containing vacuole ( LCV ) that supports its intracellular 37 replication [ 4 ] . The virulence of L . pneumophila is correlated with its ability to survive and 38 replicate in the LCV [ 4 ] . Biogenesis of the LCV requires the Dot / Icm system that transports 39 over 330 protein substrates into the host cell [ 5 , 6 ] . The activity of these effectors is 40 essential for the development and maintenance of this replicative niche [ 4 ] . 41 The actin cytoskeleton is involved in many essential cellular events such as 42 mitosis , cell migration , control of epithelial barrier function , and adherence of immune 43 cells [ 7 ] . Given the essential roles of the actin cytoskeleton , it is not surprising that this 44 network is a common target for bacterial virulence factors [ 8 ] . Yersinia blocks macrophage 45 phagocytosis by interfering with host Rho GTPase and the actin cytoskeleton 46 dynamics [ 9 ] . Salmonella enterica Typhimurium delivers a subset of bacterial effector 47 proteins into the eukaryotic host cell to modulate the host cell actin cytoskeleton , 48 facilitating its own internalization into non - phagocytic cells [ 10 ] . L . pneumophila has also 49 acquired the ability to modulate the actin cytoskeleton by its Dot / Icm substrates . For 50 example , RavK is a protease that disrupts host cytoskeletal structure by cleaving 51 actin [ 11 ] ; LegK2 targets the actin nucleator ARP2 / 3 complex by phosphorylating its 52 components ARPC1B and ARP3 , leading to the global actin cytoskeleton remodeling in 53 4 cells [ 12 ] ; Ceg14 affects actin distribution and inhibits actin polymerization by a yet 54 unknown mechanism [ 13 ] ; VipA interferes with organelle trafficking by acting as a 55 nucleator for actin polymerization [ 14 ] . 56 Post - translational modifications ( PTMs ) of host proteins involved in important 57 cellular processes is a commonly used mechanism used by bacterial pathogens to 58 counteract host defense [ 15 ] . PTMs often is executed by virulence factors that display 59 diverse biochemical activities . A number of unique PTMs have been found to be imposed 60 by Dot / Icm effectors , including phosphorylcholination [ 16 , 17 ] , AMPylation [ 18 ] , 61 phosphorylation [ 19 ] , ADP - ribosylation [ 20 - 22 ] , ubiquitination [ 20 , 23 ] , and 62 transglutamination [ 23 ] . Among these , transglutamination is induced by 63 transglutaminases ( TGs ) that primarily catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond 64 between the γ - carboxamide group of a glutamine residue from one protein and the ε - 65 amino group of a lysine residue of another protein with the release of an ammonia [ 24 ] . 66 This modification has been identified as an important PTM that attacks a wide spectrum 67 of host functions to benefit the pathogens . For example , the HopX ( AvrPphE ) family of 68 Pseudomonas syringae Type III effectors are composed of a conserved putative cysteine - 69 base catalytic triad resemble of the transglutaminase family that is required for the 70 generation of a cell - death response in specific Arabidopsis ecotypes [ 25 ] . The type III 71 effector VopC promotes Vibrio invasion by activating Rac and CDC42 via its 72 transglutaminase activity [ 26 ] . Modification by transglutamination by L . pneumophila 73 effectors has recently emerged as an important virulence factor of this bacterium . The L . 74 pneumophila effector MavC has been characterized as a transglutaminase that catalyzes 75 5 the formation of a covalent linkage between ubiquitin and UBE2N , leading to the inhibition 76 of NF - κB signaling in the initial phase of bacterial infection [ 23 ] . 77 Here , we showed that the Dot / Icm substrate RavJ ( Lpg0944 ) catalyzes crosslink 78 between actin and members of the Motin family , AMOT and AMOTL1 , via its 79 transglutaminase activity , leading to accumulation of actin polymers in mammalian cells . 80 We also showed that the transglutaminase activity of RavJ is regulated by another 81 Dot / Icm substrate LegL1 ( Lpg0945 ) , which directly binds to RavJ and inhibits the 82 enzymatic activity of RavJ . 83 Results 84 RavJ is a transglutaminase that induces actin accumulation in mammalian cells . 85 RavJ was originally identified in a study aiming to analyze the mechanism of metaeffector 86 activity in L . pneumophila [ 27 ] . Structural analysis reveals that RavJ harbors a C - H - D 87 ( C 101 H 138 D 170 ) motif associated with members of tissue transglutaminases ( TGs ) [ 27 ] . In a 88 screening to identify Dot / Icm substrates capable of regulating the actin cytoskeleton , we 89 transfected HEK293T cells with a GFP fusion library of Dot / Icm substrates and found that 90 RavJ causes rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian cells ( Fig 1 ) . To 91 determine the role of the putative catalytic motif potentially involved in TG activity in the 92 function of RavJ , we introduced mutations in C 101 , H 138 , D 170 , respectively , and found that 93 each of these mutations completely abolished the ability of RavJ to induce actin 94 cytoskeleton rearrangements ( Fig 1 ) . These results indicate that overexpression of RavJ 95 triggers the formation of actin filaments in the cell cortex by a mechanism that requires its 96 C 101 H 138 D 170 motif . 97 6 98 99 Fig 1 . Ectopic expression of RavJ causes rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton . HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and then subjected to immunofluorescence microscopic analysis . F - actin was stained by phalloidin conjugated with Texas - Red . Bar , 10 µm . Note that wild - type RavJ induces actin accumulation in the cell cortex and this phenotype is dependent on the predicted TG enzymatic motif . 7 ravJ is dispensable for intracellular growth of L . pneumophila 100 To examine the role of ravJ in L . pneumophila virulence , we first determined the level of 101 RavJ at different growth phases throughout its growth cycle in broth . RavJ was detectable 102 in all growth phases ( optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 0 . 5 - 3 . 5 ) but became highly 103 expressed in the lag phase ( OD 600 = 0 . 5 - 0 . 7 ) ( Fig 2A ) after saturated cultures were diluted 104 into fresh medium , suggesting that RavJ functions in the initial phase of infection . 105 We also determined the role of ravJ in L . pneumophila virulence by examining 106 intracellular bacterial replication of relevant bacterial strains . The mutant Lp02∆ ravJ grew 107 at rates indistinguishable from that of the wild - type strain ( Fig 2B - C ) , indicating that , 108 similar to most Dot / Icm substrates , RavJ is not required for proficient intracellular bacterial 109 replication in commonly used tissue culture hosts . 110 8 111 Fig 2 . ravJ does not influence intracellular growth of L . pneumophila . A . The growth of L . pneumophila in AYE broth ( right ) and the expression of RavJ in bacteria grown in broth ( left ) . Cultures grown to stationary phase were diluted 1 : 20 into fresh medium and the growth of bacteria was monitored by measuring OD 600 at the indicated time points . B - C . The ∆ ravJ strain grew at rates indistinguishable from that of the wild - type strain in commonly used tissue culture hosts . Bone marrow - derived mouse macrophages ( BMDMs ) ( B ) or Dictyostelium discoideum ( C ) were infected with relevant L . pneumophila strains at the indicated time points , cells were treated with 0 . 02 % saponin for half an hour and the bacteria number was determined by enumerating colony - forming unit ( CFU ) of appropriately diluted lysates obtained by saponin . Errors bars represent ±SEM ; n = 3 ; 9 Ectopically expressed RavJ crosslinks with actin . TGs function to catalyze homo - or 112 heterologous protein crosslink by a transglutamination reaction [ 24 ] . The key to 113 understand the mechanism of how RavJ induces actin rearrangement is to identify its 114 target proteins . To achieve this goal , we expressed Flag - tagged RavJ or the RavJ C101A , 115 RavJ H138A , RavJ D170A mutants in HEK293T cells . Cell lysates were subjected to 116 immunoprecipitation with beads coated with the Flag antibody . Detection of the 117 precipitated proteins by immunoblotting with the Flag antibody revealed that a portion of 118 wild - type RavJ but not the mutants migrated as higher molecular weight ( MW ) forms ( Fig 119 3A ) , suggesting it is posttranslationally modified . To identify the modification associated 120 with the upshifted protein , we expressed double - tagged Flag - RavJ - His 6 in HEK293T cells 121 and used a two - step sequential purification procedure to obtain upshifted RavJ ( Fig 3B ) . 122 Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins in the upshifted band identified abundant actin 123 and RavJ , suggesting that the upshifted band is a product generated by protein 124 conjugation between these two proteins . 125 10 126 Fig 3 . RavJ induces a molecular weight shift in actin by a putative transglutaminase activity . A . A portion of RavJ migrated as a higher molecular weight form when expressed in mammalian cells . HEK293T cells were transfected to express Flag - RavJ , RavJ C101A , RavJ H138A , or the RavJ D170A mutants . Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with beads coated with the Flag antibody . Products were resolved by SDS - PAGE and probed with the Flag antibody . Note that RavJ displayed as an upshifted band on the blot . B . Tandem purification of the Flag - RavJ - His 6 upshifted band . HEK293T cells were transfected to express Flag - RavJ - His 6 . Cell lysates were subjected to IP with beads coated with the Flag antibody . Proteins were then eluted from the beads with 3xFLAG peptide and incubated with Ni 2 + - NTA beads . Products were separated by SDS - PAGE and detected by silver staining . C . RavJ forms a covalent bond with actin in mammalian cells . HEK293T cells expressing the indicated proteins were subjected to IP with beads coated with the Flag antibody and separated by SDS - PAGE . Samples were detected by Flag - specific ( left ) and RavJ - specific ( right ) antibody , respectively . 11 127 128 Fig 4 . Actin is crosslinked to RavJ through its Gln354 residue . A . MS analysis of the Flag - RavJ - His 6 upshifted band . Coverage of the amino acids in actin are highlighted in blue . Note that Lys 84 , Lys 118 , Lys 213 , Lys 359 , Gln 121 , Gln 137 , Gln 353 , Gln 354 were not recovered from the MS , indicating them as potential linkage residues . B . The formation of Actin - RavJ was detected by immunoblotting . Note that the Actin Gln354Ala mutant has largely lost the ability to be modified ( the 3 rd lane ) . 12 129 To test whether the upshifted band is a crosslink product between actin and RavJ , 130 we coexpressed Flag - tagged actin and GFP fusion of RavJ or its mutants in HEK293T 131 cells . Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using agarose beads coated 132 with the Flag - specific antibody . We found that GFP - RavJ indeed was linked with actin 133 ( Fig 3C ) . To identify the chemical linkage between actin and RavJ , the protein band 134 corresponding to the RavJ upshifted band was excised , digested with trypsin , and 135 analyzed by mass spectrometry ( MS ) . TGs catalyze protein crosslinking by forming an 136 isopeptide bridge between the lysine ( Lys ) donor residue of one protein and the acceptor 137 glutamine ( Gln ) residue of another [ 24 ] . Thus , we hypothesized that a lysine residue and 138 S1 Fig . Determination of the crosslink site in actin . A - B . HEK293T cells co - transfected to express the indicated proteins were lysed and immunoprecipitated by beads coated with the Flag - specific antibody . Note that only the Gln354Ala mutation in actin abolished the crosslink products induced by RavJ . 13 a glutamine residue are involved in the crosslink between RavJ and actin . In the MS 139 analysis , around 80 % of the peptides in actin were recovered from the tryptic digestion , 140 indicating Lys 84 , Lys 118 , Lys 213 , Lys 359 , Gln 121 , Gln 137 , Gln 353 , Gln 354 in actin as potential 141 lysine donor residues or glutamine acceptor residues ( Fig 4A ) . Among the individual 142 mutation of these residues , only Q354A in actin abolished the ability of actin to crosslink 143 with RavJ ( Figs 4B and S1A - B ) . 144 RavJ induces crosslink between actin and members of the Motin family protein . 145 Transglutaminases normally catalyze crosslink between two proteins , and in the absence 146 of the receptor substrate , these enzymes induce crosslink between itself and the available 147 donor substrate . Our analysis of the precipitated products obtained by RavJ identified a 148 number of proteins ( Fig 3C ) , one or more of which could be potentially the second 149 substrate that crosslinks with actin in the reaction induced by RavJ . To identify such 150 proteins , we purified the crosslink products using a tandem purification method from cells 151 transfected to express Flag - HA - actin and GFP - RavJ . Samples similarly transfected to 152 express the catalytically inactive RavJ C101A mutant were used as controls . Twenty - four 153 hours after transfection , cell lysates were subjected to IP with beads coated with the Flag 154 antibody . Proteins eluted with 3XFLAG peptide were further purified by IP with the HA 155 antibody . Samples separated by SDS - PAGE were detected by immunoblotting with the 156 appropriate antibodies . In samples transfected to express GFP - RavJ , several upshifted 157 bands were detected with the anti - Flag antibody ( S2A Fig ) . The gels containing upshifted 158 proteins were excised , digested with trypsin , and analyzed by mass spectrometry , which 159 allowed us to obtain a list of proteins that potentially crosslink with actin ( Table 1 ) . Two 160 of Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome and SCAR homolog ( WASH ) complex components , 161 14 WASHC4 and WASHC5 , and one protein from the Motin family , Angiomotin ( AMOT ) were 162 among the proteins identified with high confidence . We considered these proteins as 163 potential substrates of RavJ because of their relevance to the actin cytoskeleton network . 164 Further analysis showed that RavJ did not detectably induce crosslink between actin and 165 WASHC4 or WASHC5 ( S2B - 2C Fig ) . Importantly , we found that AMOT is able to form a 166 conjugate with actin when coexpressed with RavJ ( Fig 5B ) , suggesting that AMOT is the 167 second substrate of the crosslinking reaction catalyzed by RavJ . 168 15 169 S2 Fig . Identification of the cellular targets of RavJ . A . Tandem purification of actin crosslink products catalyzed by RavJ . HEK293T cells co - transfected to express Flag - HA - Actin , GFP - RavJ or GFP - RavJ C101A were subjected to IP with beads coated with the Flag antibody . Proteins were eluted from the beads by 3XFLAG peptide . Elution fractions were then immunoprecipitated with beads coated with the HA - specific antibody . Products resolved by SDS - PAGE were detected by silver staining ( right ) or probed with the Flag antibody ( left ) . Gel plug corresponding to the upshifted band was cut for MS analysis . B - C . WASHC4 and WASHC5 do not crosslink with actin in the presence of RavJ . HEK293T cells co - transfected to express the indicated proteins were lysed and immunoprecipitated by beads coated with the Flag - specific or HA - specific antibody . Note that there is no crosslink products detected between actin and WASHC4 or WASHC5 . 16 Table 1 : Top hits from MS analysis of the tandem purification 170 171 To verify that AMOT is targeted by RavJ , we tested the crosslink between 172 endogenous actin and AMOT . In cells transfected to express GFP - RavJ , crosslink 173 products formed by endogenous actin and AMOT were detected ( Fig 5C ) . We also 174 observed crosslink between actin and AMOT - p80 ( Fig 5D ) , an AMOT isoform arose from 175 alternative splicing of the AMOT transcript ( Fig 5A ) . In addition , we have tested 176 Angiomotin - like 1 ( AMOTL1 ) , which is another member in the Motin family having 177 significant homology with AMOT . Crosslink products of AMOTL1 and actin were detected 178 in HEK293T cells expressing wild - type RavJ but not its catalytically inactive mutants ( Fig 179 5E ) . Taken together , our results indicate that RavJ catalyzes the crosslink between actin 180 and members of the Motin family . 181 17 182 Fig 5 . RavJ catalyzes crosslinks between actin and members of the Motin protein family . A . A schematic view of the two isoforms of AMOT produced by alternative splicing of the AMOT mRNA . The two isoforms , AMOT - p130 and AMOT - p80 , are characterized by a conserved coiled - coil domain , a C - terminal PDZ binding domain , and an angiostatin binding domain . The AMOT - p130 isoform harbors a unique N - terminal domain . B . Actin conjugates with AMOT - p130 in the presence of RavJ . HEK293T cells co - transfected with the indicated proteins were lysed and subjected to IP with beads coated with the Flag antibody or the HA antibody . Samples resolved by SDS - PAGE were probed with a Flag - specific antibody or an HA - specific antibody . C . RavJ induces crosslink between HA - AMOT and endogenous actin . Cells expressing HA - AMOT - p130 and GFP - RavJ or the GFP - RavJ C101A mutant were lysed and immunoprecipitated with beads coated with the HA antibody . Crosslink products were probed by immunoblotting using either Actin or Flag antibody . 18 The Motin family of proteins harbor several structural domains , including the N - 183 terminus domain potentially involved in Yes - associated protein 1 ( YAP1 ) binding [ 28 ] , a 184 conserved coiled - coil ( CC ) domain and the C - terminal PDZ - binding domain [ 29 ] ( Fig 6A ) . 185 To determine the crosslink site on AMOT , we constructed a number of HA - tagged AMOT 186 truncation mutants ( Fig 6A ) and tested their ability to crosslink with actin in cells 187 expressing RavJ . Our results showed that all the four truncations were able to crosslink 188 with actin ( Fig 6B - C and 6F ) . To identify the modification sites on each truncation , the 189 corresponding crosslink products were subjected to MS analysis ( S3A - C Fig ) . However , 190 despite multiple attempts using different enzymes to digest the crosslink products , we 191 were unable to detect the crosslink sites between the two proteins . The mass of the 192 peptide without the crosslink is too big to extract the peptide from the gel and to sequence 193 it . We then mutated the two lysine residues in the truncation contains the PDZ - binding 194 domain ( Fig 6E ) . Substitution mutant in Lys 1051 was enough to abolish the crosslink 195 product ( Fig 6E ) . The same mutation in the AMOT 871 - 1084 truncation also abolished the 196 crosslink product ( Fig 6D ) , suggesting that AMOT 871 - 1084 crosslinks with actin through its 197 Lys 1051 residue . 198 D . Actin forms a conjugate with AMOT - p80 in HEK293T cells in the presence of RavJ .

RavJ catalyzes the formation of a covalent bond between the N - terminal domain of AMOT - p130 and actin . 20 200 RavJ catalyzes crosslink between purified actin and AMOT . We next examined 201 whether crosslink between actin and AMOT occurs in cell - free reactions . HEK293T cells 202 S3 Fig . Determination of the crosslink sites in AMOT . A - C . Tandem purification of crosslink products of actin and AMOT truncations . HEK293T cells co - transfected to express the indicated proteins were subjected to IP with beads coated with the Flag antibody . Proteins were eluted from the beads by 3XFLAG peptide . Elution fractions were then immunoprecipitated with beads coated with the HA - specific antibody . Products resolved by SDS - PAGE were detected by silver staining ( right ) or probed with the indicated antibodies ( left ) . Protein bands corresponding to the crosslink products were excised for MS analysis . 21 transfected to express Flag - Actin , HA - AMOT , GFP - RavJ or GFP - RavJ C101A , respectively , 203 were lysed , and the lysates were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 2 h . Beads coated with 204 the Flag antibody were used to enrich Flag - Actin and products of crosslinking formed by 205 actin and AMOT were detected by immunoblotting . Protein conjugate detectable by the 206 HA - specific antibody was detected only in reactions that received lysates containing wild - 207 type RavJ ( Fig 7A ) , indicating that RavJ - induced crosslink between actin and AMOT 208 occurs in a cell - free system . 209 To further determine the activity of this transglutaminase , recombinant RavJ 210 purified from E . coli was incubated with Flag - Actin and HA - AMOT purified from HEK293T 211 cells , and the production of a crosslink product was detected after the reactions were 212 allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37°C ( Fig 7B ) . Consistent with results from earlier 213 experiments with cell lysates , adding His 6 - RavJ C101A to the reactions did not cause 214 crosslink between these two proteins ( Fig 7B ) . Together , these results establish that 215 RavJ is a transglutaminase that catalyzes crosslink between AMOT and actin . 216 L . pneumophila induces crosslinking between actin and AMOT in a RavJ - 217 dependent manner . Our results from ectopic expression by transfection strongly suggest 218 that RavJ catalyzes protein crosslink between AMOT and actin . To determine whether 219 this reaction is physiologically relevant , we attempted to determine the activity of RavJ 220 during L . pneumophila infection . HEK293T cells transfected to express the FcγII receptor 221 were infected with opsonized bacteria of relevant L . pneumophila strains at an multiplicity 222 of infection ( MOI ) of 50 . No crosslink between AMOT and actin was detected in cells 223 infected with strain Lp03 , an avirulent dotA mutant , or the wild - type stain Lp02 ( S4 Fig ) . 224 Considering the possibility that the amount of crosslinked products was too low in 225 22 samples infected with strain Lp02 , we examined whether overexpression of RavJ in the 226 wild - type strain background allows us to detect the crosslink products . Indeed , infection 227 of the cells with strain ∆ ravJ ( pRavJ ) led to robust crosslink between AMOT and actin ( Fig 228 7C ) . In contrast , crosslink did not occur in cells similarly infected with strain 229 ∆ ravJ ( pRavJ C101A ) , which overexpressed the enzymatically inactive RavJ mutant ( Fig 230 7C ) . These results indicate RavJ catalyzes crosslink between actin and AMOT in cells 231 infected with L . pneumophila competent in the Dot / Icm system that overexpressed wild - 232 type RavJ . The amount of crosslink products in cells infected with the wild - type strain 233 likely was not sufficient for detection with our method , RavJ likely catalyzes the crosslink 234 between actin and the Motin family of proteins . 235 236 S4 Fig . Determination of the effect of RavJ during bacterial infection . HEK293T cells transfected to express the FcγII receptor were treated with opsonized bacterial strains as indicated .

RavJ induces crosslink between purified actin and AMOT in vitro . Reactions containing Flag - Actin , HA - AMOT , His 6 - RavJ or His 6 - RavJ C101A were incubated at 37°C for 2 h .

The blots were probed with the indicated antibodies . 24 Simultaneous knockdown of AMOT and AMOTL1 interferes with the formation of 238 actin filaments induced by RavJ . Ectopic expression of RavJ in mammalian cells led to 239 the formation of actin filaments ( Fig 1 ) . The observation that RavJ induces protein 240 crosslink between AMOT and actin suggests that this event is important for the actin 241 polymerization phenotype . To examine the relevance between protein crosslink and the 242 formation of actin filaments , we determined the impact of AMOT depletion on RavJ - 243 induced actin filament formation . To this end , we introduced shRNAs that target mRNAs 244 of both AMOT and AMOTL1 into HEK293T cells , which is known to express high levels 245 of these two isoforms but almost an undetectable level of AMOTL2 [ 30 ] . Introduction of 246 shRNAs by lentiviral transduction led to significant reduction of the protein levels of both 247 AMOT and AMOTL1 ( Fig 8A ) . Next , we expressed RavJ in these cells by transfection 248 and examined the formation of actin filaments by phalloidin staining . In samples that 249 received scramble shRNAs , actin filaments were readily detected at rates similar to 250 untreated cells ( Fig 8B ) . Consistently , crosslink between actin and AMOT became 251 undetectable in these cells ( Fig 8C ) . Furthermore , overexpression of AMOT by 252 transfection rescued not only RavJ - induced formation of actin filaments but also the 253 crosslink between actin and AMOT ( Fig 8B - C ) . Taken together , these results support a 254 conclusion that members of the Motin family of proteins are important for RavJ - induced 255 actin accumulation by forming protein conjugates with actin . 256 257 25 258 Fig 8 . Knockdown of AMOT and AMOTL1 reduced actin accumulation in HEK293T cells induced by RavJ . A . Expression level of AMOT and AMOTL1 was examined by Western blot .

Crosslinking products were detected with the Flag - specific antibody and AMOT - specific antibodies , respectively . 26 259 RavJ interferes with the interaction between actin and cofilin . Earlier studies suggest 260 that actin interacts with profilin and cofilin through its Gln 354 residue [ 31 - 33 ] . Cofilin 261 depolymerizes and severs actin filaments while profilin binds to actin monomers and 262 provides ATP - Actin for incorporation into actin filaments [ 34 ] . The fact that actin crosslinks 263 with RavJ and AMOT via Gln 354 inspired us to investigate whether RavJ affects the 264 binding between actin and actin binding proteins . HA - profilin - 1 , HA - profilin - 2 or GFP - 265 cofilin were expressed in HEK293T cells along with relevant proteins , and cell lysates 266 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the Flag - specific antibody . Interestingly , 267 expression of RavJ reduced the binding between actin and cofilin ( Figure 8D ) , but not 268 profilin - 1 and profilin - 2 ( S5A - B Fig ) , suggesting that RavJ - induced actin accumulation in 269 cell cortex was a result of reduced actin depolymerization . 270 271 D . RavJ inhibits the binding between actin and cofilin . Cells transfected to express the indicated proteins were lysed and subjected to IP with beads coated with the Flag - specific antibody . Binding between actin and cofilin were detected by the indicated antibodies . 27 LegL1 blocks the activity of RavJ by sterically hindering its catalytic site . In a 272 previous study , LegL1 ( Lpg0945 ) was identified as a putative metaeffector of RavJ which 273 interacts with its amino terminus containing the predicted motif important for its enzymatic 274 activity [ 27 ] . We then tested whether LegL1 can influence actin cytoskeleton 275 rearrangement induced by RavJ . Coexpression of HA - LegL1 with GFP - RavJ significantly 276 reduced the formation of crosslink products by actin and AMOTs and such reduction 277 became more apparent as the ratio between LegL1 and RavJ increased ( Fig 9A ) , 278 indicating that LegL1 inhibits the activity of RavJ . The inhibitory effect of LegL1 can 279 attribute to at least two potential mechanisms : LegL1 reverses the crosslink by an 280 enzymatic activity , or it inhibits the activity of RavJ by direct binding . 281 To distinguish between these two possibilities , we pre - incubated cell lysates 282 expressing HA - LegL1 with cell lysates expressing GFP - RavJ for 1 h at 37°C . Cell lysates 283 expressing HA - AMOT and Flag - Actin , respectively , were then added to the cell - free 284 system . RavJ that has been pre - incubated with HA - LegL1 was unable to induce crosslink 285 between actin and AMOT , suggesting that LegL1 blocks the activity of RavJ ( Fig 9B ) . 286 Furthermore , addition of HA - LegL1 to reactions containing crosslinked actin - AMOT did 287 not detectably reduce the amount of the conjugate product ( S6 Fig ) . We also tested the 288 activity of recombinant LegL1 purified from E . coli . Incubation of GST - LegL1 with cell 289 lysates expressing GFP - RavJ ablated its ability to catalyze crosslink between actin and 290 AMOT ( Fig 9D ) . 291 S5 Fig . Effects of RavJ on the binding between actin and actin binding proteins . A - B . RavJ does not influence the binding between actin and actin binding proteins , profilin 1 and profilin 2 . HEK293T cells co - transfected to express the indicated proteins were lysed and subjected to IP with beads coated with a Flag - specific antibody . 28 We next examined the interactions between LegL1 and RavJ in L . pneumophila . 292 RavJ can be immunoprecipitated from lysates of L . pneumophila expressing Flag - LegL1 293 with beads coated with the Flag antibody , indicating binding between LegL1 and RavJ 294 ( Fig 9E ) . We further tested the effect of LegL1 on RavJ - induced crosslink during bacterial 295 infection . HEK293T cells were infected with ravJ mutant complemented with RavJ , the 296 RavJ C101A mutant , or both RavJ and LegL1 , at an MOI of 50 . Crosslink between AMOT 297 and actin was only detected in cells infected with the ∆ ravJ ( pRavJ ) strain but not strain 298 ∆ ravJ ( pRavJ , pLegL1 ) ( Fig 9C ) , suggesting that LegL1 effectively inhibits the crosslink 299 caused by RavJ during bacterial infection . The translocation of RavJ into host cells is not 300 influenced by LegL1 , indicating that the regulation of RavJ by LegL1 is likely occurs in the 301 host cells ( Fig 9F ) . Collectively , these results indicate that LegL1 blocks the activity of 302 RavJ by direct binding . 303 S6 Fig . LegL1 does not reverse the transglutaminase activity of RavJ . HEK293T cells transfected to express the indicated proteins were lysed and subjected to IP with beads coated with the Flag - specific antibody . Note that expression of HA - LegL1 did not remove actin from the crosslink product . 29 304 Fig 9 . LegL1 antagonizes the catalytic activity of RavJ . A . expression of LegL1 in HEK293T cells reduced crosslink products induced by RavJ . Lysates of cells transfected to express the indicated proteins were subjected to IP with beads coated with the Flag antibody and the products resolved by SDS - PAGE were detected with the indicated antibodies . B . LegL1 inhibits the activity of RavJ in a cell - free system . Cells transfected to express Flag - Actin , HA - LegL1 , HA - AMOT , GFP - RavJ , and GFP - RavJ C101A , respectively , were lysed with RIPA buffer without EDTA . Lysates of HA - LegL1 was pre - incubated with those expressing GFP - RavJ for 1 h at 37°C . Reactions containing the indicated cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with beads coated with the Flag antibody and proteins were detected with the indicated antibodies . C . Overexpression of LegL1 in L . pneumophila inhibits the enzymatic activity of RavJ . Bacteria of the indicated L . pneumophila strains were opsonized prior to infecting HEK293T cells transfected to express the FcγII receptor at an MOI of 50 for 4 h . Cells lysed with 0 . 2 % saponin were probed with the indicated antibodies . 30 305 D . Recombinant LegL1 reduces the crosslink products induced by RavJ . Cells transfected to express Flag - Actin , HA - AMOT , GFP - RavJ , and GFP - RavJ C101A , respectively , were lysed with RIPA buffer without EDTA . 10 μg GST - LegL1 was pre - incubated with cell lysates of GFP - RavJ for 1 h at 37°C . Reactions containing the indicated components were immunoprecipitated with beads coated with the Flag antibody and proteins were detected with the indicated antibodies . E . LegL1 directly binds to RavJ in L . pneumophila . Bacterial cells carrying either the vector pZLQ or pZLQ - LegL1 were lysed with RIPA buffer and then immunoprecipitated with beads coated with the Flag antibody . Binding between RavJ and LegL1 was detected by RavJ - specific antibodies and the Flag antibody , respectively F . Overexpression of LegL1 in L . pneumophila does not influence the translocation of RavJ . HEK293T cells transfected to express the FcγII receptor were treated with different bacterial strains : 1 . No infection , 2 . Wild - type L . pneumophila . 3 . Wild type L . pneumophila overexpressing Flag - LegL1 . Cells were collected at the indicated time points and lysed by 0 . 2 % saponin . RavJ and LegL1 translocation were detected by RavJ - specific antibodies and the Flag - specific antibody respectively . Tubulin was probed as a loading control . 31 Discussion 306 The actin cytoskeleton network is a major host structural component that provides 307 structural and functional support in numerous vital cellular activities . It also directs the 308 trafficking of cargo - containing vesicle trafficking throughout the cell by functioning as a 309 highway [ 35 ] . Intracellular bacterial pathogens have evolved remarkable strategies to 310 subvert the host cytoskeletal machinery to promote bacterial internalization , facilitate the 311 biogenesis of bacteria - containing phagosomes , and co - opt actin - dependent movement 312 to benefit pathogen dissemination [ 36 ] . To support diverse infection events , intracellular 313 pathogens hijack the actin cytoskeleton by introducing effector proteins into the host 314 cytosol by specialized secretion systems [ 8 ] . Among these , Coxiella burnetii triggers actin 315 reorganization at the attachment site of phagocytic human macrophages by binding to 316 CR3 receptors to stimulate bacterial internalization [ 37 ] . After entering a host cell , this 317 bacterium replicates within an acidic compartment called the parasitophorous vacuole 318 ( PV ) in macrophages . Optimal intracellular growth of C . burnetii requires F - actin 319 accumulation around the PV , but the detailed mechanisms are not fully characterized [ 38 ] . 320 Chlamydia species replicate in a host membrane - derived compartment termed inclusion . 321 Optimal development and maintenance of vacuole morphology and integrity require F - 322 actin rings surrounding the inclusion to stabilize the organelle [ 39 , 40 ] . Spotted Fever 323 Group Rickettsia , such as R . rickettsii and R . conorii , escape the phagosome before 324 lysosomal fusion after entering a host cell . After escape , these bacteria induce actin 325 polymerization to form an actin tail that facilitates bacterial motility within the cell [ 41 , 42 ] . 326 Actin exists in two main forms of organization , the monomeric G - actin , and the 327 filamentous form F - actin [ 43 ] . Polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments are 328 32 kept in a dynamic balance to tightly regulate movement and other cell functions [ 43 ] . The 329 VCA domains of N - WASP ( Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ) and SCAR / WAVE 330 ( suppressor of Camp receptor / WASP - family verprolin homologous protein ) activate the 331 actin nucleator Arp2 / 3 complex to generate new F - actin branches from preexisting mother 332 filaments [ 44 ] . Actin - depolymerizing factor ADF / cofilin regulates actin dynamics by 333 depolymerizing filaments at their pointed ends , thereby restoring a pool of actin 334 monomers for filament assembly [ 35 ] . Actin molecule harbors two main lobes separated 335 by a deep upper cleft . Each main lobe is subdivided into two clearly discernible 336 subdomains , SD1 - 4 [ 45 ] . SD1 , which is built from residues 1 - 32 , 70 - 144 , and 338 - 375 , 337 forms an important target area for a large number of actin - binding proteins such as profilin , 338 cofilin and gelsolin [ 45 ] . Of note is that RavJ - induced actin crosslink with AMOT occurs at 339 Gln354 , a site locates on the SD1 , suggesting that this crosslinking event may interfere 340 with the interaction between actin subunits in the filament and the actin binding proteins . 341 In agreement with this notion , the binding between cofilin and actin is significantly reduced 342 ( Fig 8D ) , indicating that RavJ functions to block actin depolymerization , resulting in the 343 accumulation of F - actin in cell cortex . 344 It has been known for a long time that L . pneumophila avoids the delivery of its 345 vacuole to lysosomes by modulating the ER - to - Golgi vesicle trafficking [ 46 ] . Shortly after 346 being internalized by a host cell , the plasma membrane derived vacuole containing L . 347 pneumophila will be converted into a compartment that has similarity to an ER - Golgi 348 intermediate compartment [ 47 - 49 ] . The biogenesis of this specialized phagosome has 349 been studied extensively [ 49 ] . A repertoire of Dot / Icm effectors have been demonstrated 350 to hijack the host vesicle trafficking pathway directly [ 2 , 50 ] , some of them could affect this 351 33 cellular process indirectly to bypass the microbicidal endosomal compartment [ 51 ] . The 352 modulation of the actin cytoskeleton clearly contributes to the development of the LCV . 353 For example , the metal protease RavK cleaves actin , abolishing its ability to form actin 354 polymers [ 11 ] whereas LegK2 phosphorylates components of actin nucleator ARP2 / 3 355 complex and thus inhibits actin polymerization on the phagosome [ 11 ] . Ceg14 inhibits 356 actin polymerization by a yet unknown mechanism [ 13 ] . These proteins are very likely 357 working in synergic to temporally inhibit actin polymerization on the LCV and thus 358 preventing fusion with late endosomes [ 12 ] . In contrast to the inhibitory effects of RavK 359 and LegK2 , VipA enhances actin polymerization by acting as an actin nucleator [ 14 ] . RavJ 360 also appears to promote the formation of actin filaments . Here , we showed that RavJ - 361 induced crosslink between actin and AMOT blocks the depolymerization activity of 362 ADF / cofilin , resulting in the stabilization of actin polymers in cell cortex ( S7 Fig ) . Clearly , 363 in cells infected with L . pneumophila , its effectors strike a balance between the two states 364 of actin . Balanced modulation of host processes has recently emerged as a prominent 365 feature associated with the interactions between L . pneumophila and its hosts . In some 366 cases , the balance is achieved by effector pairs with opposite biochemical activity which 367 may function at different phases of infection [ 52 ] . In other cases , the importance of balance 368 lies in the cellular locations of the molecular events regulated by the effectors [ 17 ] . In 369 addition to other effectors that inhibit actin polymerization , the regulation imposed by RavJ 370 is controlled by its metaeffector LegL1 , which blocks its function by direct protein - protein 371 interactions . LegL1 likely functions to spatially and temporally prevent RavJ from inducing 372 excessive actin polymerization . 373 34 374 375 Clathrin - vesicle associated proteins regulate vesicle assembly by binding directly 376 to the actin filaments through a C - terminal talin - like domain , indicating important 377 correlation between actin polymerization and endocytic vesicle trafficking [ 53 ] . Actin 378 filaments also play a key role in maintaining ER structure and the ER - to - Golgi 379 trafficking [ 54 ] . Given the extensive interconnection between vesicle trafficking and the 380 actin cytoskeleton , RavJ is likely working in concert with VipA to enhance cargo 381 transportation between ER and the LCV , thus facilitating fusions between the ER - derived 382 vesicles and the LCV . Together , these effectors are likely work in concert to promote 383 bacterial replication by indirectly interfering with the vesicle trafficking pathway . 384 S7 Fig . A predicted model of RavJ in actin cytoskeleton modulation . RavJ catalyzes the crosslink between actin and AMOT , which led to the blockage of the ADF / cofilin binding site in actin , resulting in stabilization of actin fibers in the cell cortex . 35 Materials and Methods 385 Media , bacteria strains , and cell lines .

The 532 fragmentation of precursor ion was accomplished by stepped normalized collision energy 533 setting of 27 % . The resolution of Orbitrap mass analyzer was set to 120 , 000 and 15 , 000 534 for MS1 and MS2 , respectively . The full scan MS1 spectra were collected in the mass 535 range of 350 - 1 , 600 m / z , with an isolation window of 1 . 2m / z and a fixed first mass of 100 536 m / z for MS2 . The spray voltage was set at 2 and Automatic Gain Control ( AGC ) target of 537 4e5 for MS1 and 5e4 for MS2 , respectively . 538 For protein identification , the raw data were processed with the software 539 MaxQuant [ 67 ] ( version 1 . 6 . 3 . 3 ) against Homo sapiens database downloaded from the 540 UniProt ( www . uniprot . org ) . The following parameters were edited for the searches : 541 precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm ; enzyme specificity of trypsin enzyme allowing up to 542 2 missed cleavages ; oxidation of methionine ( M ) as a variable modification and 543 carbamidomethylation of cysteine ( C ) as a fixed modification . False discovery rate ( FDR ) 544 42 of peptide spectral match ( PSM ) and protein identification was set to 0 . 01 . The unique 545 plus razor peptides ( non - redundant , non - unique peptides assigned to the protein group 546 with most other peptides ) were used for peptide quantitation . LFQ intensity values were 547 used for relative protein abundance measurement . Only proteins detected with at least 548 one unique peptide and MS / MS ≥2 ( spectral counts ) were considered as true 549 identification and used for downstream analysis . 550 551 Materials Availability Statement : All unique constructs and cell lines described in this 552 article are available upon reasonable request from academic researchers .
