In this study , we characterized the CaM - binding peptide of a CaM - KK ( residues 438 – 463 ) , which suppressed the activity of constitutively active CaM - KK ( 84 – 434 ) in the absence of Ca 2 1 / CaM but com - petitively with ATP . Truncation and site - directed mu - tagenesis of the CaM - binding region in CaM - KK reveal that Ile 441 is essential for autoinhibition of CaM - KK . Furthermore , CaM - KK chimera mutants containing the CaM - binding sequence of either myosin light chain ki - nases or CaM kinase II located C - terminal of Leu 440 , exhibited enhanced Ca 2 1 / CaM - independent activity ( 60 % of total activity ) . Although the CaM - binding do - mains of myosin light chain kinases and CaM kinase II bind to the N - and C - terminal domains of CaM in the opposite orientation to CaM - KK ( Osawa , M . , Tokumitsu , H . , Swindells , M . B . , Kurihara , H . , Orita , M . , Shibanuma , T . , Furuya , T . , and Ikura , M . ( 1999 ) Nat . Struct . Biol . 6 , 819 – 824 ) , the chimeric CaM - KKs containing Ile 441 re - mained Ca 2 1 / CaM - dependent . This result demonstrates that the orientation of the CaM binding is not critical for relief of CaM - KK autoinhibition . However , the require - ment of Ile 441 for autoinhibition , which is located at the 2 3 position from the N - terminal anchoring residue ( Trp 444 ) to CaM , accounts for the opposite orientation of CaM binding of CaM - KK compared with other CaM kinases . Ca 2 1 / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase kinase ( CaM - KK ) 1 has been identified and cloned as an activator for two multifunctional CaM kinases , CaM - KI and IV . The identifica - tion of this new CaM kinase regulating other CaM kinases revealed a novel intracellular Ca 2 1 - mediated signal transduc - tion pathway , the CaM kinase cascade ( 1 – 6 ) . Phosphorylation by CaM - KK of Thr , located in the activation loop of the catalytic domain of CaM - KI and CaM - KIV , results in a large increase in the catalytic efficiency of each CaM kinase ( 5 – 7 ) . Two CaM - KK genes ( a and b ) have been cloned in mammal ( 4 , 8 , 9 ) , whereas only one gene was characterized in Caenorhabditis elegans ( 10 , 11 ) . In mammals , the highest expression of the a and b iso - forms of CaM - KK is observed in the brain , although the a isoform is also expressed in various peripheral tissues such as thymus and spleen ( 4 ) . Numerous studies demonstrated that the CaM - KK / CaM - KIV cascade is present and functional in various cell types such as Jurkat cells ( 12 ) , cultured hippocampal neurons ( 13 ) , and transfected COS - 7 cells ( 7 ) . An important role for the CaM - KK / CaM - KIV cascade in the regulation of Ca 2 1 - dependent gene expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors such as cAMP - response element - binding protein has been dem - onstrated ( 13 – 17 ) . The CaM - KK / CaM - KI cascade is activated in PC12 cells upon membrane depolarization , although its physiological role remains to be determined ( 18 ) . Recently a kinase homologous to mammalian CaM - KI ( Ce CaM - KI ) has been cloned in C . elegans ( 19 ) . Unlike mammalian CaM - KI , overexpressed Ce CaM - KI is predominantly localized in the nucleus of transfected cells because of the presence of an N - terminal nuclear localization signal . In transfected cells , Ce CaM - KK and Ce CaM - KI reconstitute a signaling pathway that mediates Ca 2 1 - dependent phosphorylation of cAMP - re - sponse element - binding protein and cAMP - response element - dependent transcription , similarly to the mammalian CaM - KK / CaM - KIV pathway . In addition to CaM - KI and IV , protein kinase B has been identified as a target for CaM - KK . The phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase B by CaM - KK is responsible for the anti - apoptotic effect upon modest eleva - tion of intracellular Ca 2 1 in NG108 cells ( 20 ) . CaM - KK has an N - terminal catalytic domain and a regula - tory domain containing autoinhibitory and CaM - binding seg - ments at its C terminus in a similar manner to other CaM kinases . The catalytic domain of CaM - KK contains a unique Arg - Pro - rich 22 residues insert , which plays an important role for recognition of downstream CaM kinases ( 11 ) . The binding of Ca 2 1 / CaM to CaM - KK is absolutely required for its activation and efficient phosphorylation of target protein kinases ( 7 , 27 ) . Previous studies using site - directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides identified the CaM - binding region of a CaM - KK as spanning residues 438 – 463 ( 21 ) . The three - dimensional struc - ture of the Ca 2 1 - CaM complex with the a CaM - KK peptide ( residues 438 – 463 ) has been resolved by NMR spectroscopy . The CaM - KK peptide forms a fold comprising an a - helix ( resi - dues 444 – 454 ) and a hairpin - like loop ( residues 455 – 459 ) whose C terminus folds back onto the helix ( 22 ) . This unique loop structure in CaM - KK peptide is stabilized by intramolec - ular hydrophobic interaction between Met 453 and Phe 459 , which anchor to the C - terminal domain of CaM , as well as interactions involving Phe 463 , Ile 448 , and Leu 449 . This was con - firmed by mutation of either Phe 459 or Phe 463 to Asp , which resulted in a significant reduction of CaM - binding ability of * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

Trp 444 was also identified as another anchoring res - idue to the N - terminal domain of CaM . Therefore , the orienta - tion of the CaM - KK peptide with respect to the two CaM domains is opposite to that of the MLCKs and CaM - KII pep - tides ( 35 – 37 ) . These observations raised the question why CaM - KK requires an opposite orientation of CaM binding to that of other CaM kinases for the regulation of its protein kinase activity . In this report , we present evidences using CaM - KK mutants and chimeras to assume the critical role of the unique regulatory domain of CaM - KK and the orientation of CaM binding for the kinase autoinhibition . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials— a CaM - KK cDNA ( GenBank TM accession number L42810 ) was from a rat brain cDNA library ( 4 ) . GST - CaM - KK - ( 84 – 434 ) was constructed by the insertion of a Xba I - digested fragment from pME - CaM - KK - ( 1 – 434 , 21 ) into pGEX - KG vector , and the recombinant en - zyme was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified on gluta - thione - Sepharose . GST - CaM - KI - ( 1 – 293 , K49E ) into pGEX - 4T3 was constructed by polymerase chain reaction followed by mutagenesis using a mutagenic oligonucleotide ( 5 9 - AAACTGGTGGCCATCGAATG - CATTGCCAAGAAG - 3 9 ) and a GeneEditor in vitro site - directed mu - tagenesis system ( Promega Co . ) . Expressed GST - CaM - KI - ( 1 – 293 , K49E ) in E . coli JM109 was purified on glutathione - Sepharose . Recom - binant rat CaM was expressed in E . coli BL - 21 ( DE3 ) using pET - CaM ( 23 ) , which was kindly provided from Dr . Nobuhiro Hayashi ( Fujita Health University , Toyoake , Japan ) , and purified by phenyl - Sepharose column chromatography . Nucleotide sequences of those constructs were confirmed . Twenty six - residue synthetic peptides corresponding to the calmodulin - binding domain of both rat a CaM - KK ( residues 438 – 463 ) ( 21 ) and C . elegans CaM - KK ( residues 331 – 356 ) ( 11 ) were synthesized by the Peptide Institute Inc . ( Osaka , Japan ) . Purity of either peptide was estimated at higher than 95 % judging by high pressure liquid chromatography . All other chemicals were from standard commercial sources . Construction of CaM - KK Mutants— Mutagenesis of CaM - KK using pME - CaM - KK ( wild - type , 4 ) plasmid as a template was carried out by a GeneEditor in vitro site - directed mutagenesis system ( Promega Co . ) and mutagenic oligonucleotides as follows ; I441A , 5 9 - AACTCAGTCAA - GCTTGCCCCCAGCTGGACC - 3 9 ; I441R , 5 9 - AACTCAGTCAAGCTTCG - CCCCAGCTGGACC - 3 9 ; I441D , 5 9 - AACTCAGTCAAGCTTGACCCCAG - CTGGACC - 3 9 . For CaM - KK truncation and chimera mutants , pME - CaM - KK - ( 1 – 463 , 21 ) was mutated at Ile 441 by a mutagenic oligonucleotide ( 5 9 - AAGAACTCAGTCAAGCTTAAGCCCAGCTGGACCACT - 3 9 ) to intro - duce the Afl II site and then digested with Afl II followed by treating with mung bean nuclease to create a blunt end at the first codon ( C ) of Leu 440 . After digestion with Not I , the linearized plasmid ligated with pre - annealed double - stranded oligonucleotides containing the Not I site as follow : pME - CaM - KK - ( 1 – 440 ) , 5 9 - TCTGACATATGCGCTCTAGAA - CTAGTGC - 3 9 and 5 9 - GGCCGCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGCATATGTCAG - A - 3 9 ; pME - CaM - KK - ( 1 – 441 ) , 5 9 - TCATCTGACATATGCGCTCTAGAA - CTAGTGC - 3 9 and 5 9 - GGCCGCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGCATATGTCAG - ATGA - 3 9 ; pME - CaM - KK - ( 1 – 443 ) , 5 9 - TCATCCCCAGCTGACATATGC - GCTCTAGAACTAGTGC - 3 9 and 5 9 - GGCCGCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGC - ATATGTCAGCTGGGGATGA - 3 9 ; pME - CaM - KK - ( 1 – 444 ) , 5 9 - TCATCC - CCAGCTGGTGACATATGCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGC - 3 9 and 5 9 - GGCC - GCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGCATATGTCACCAGCTGGGGATGA - 3 9 ; pME - CaM - KK - 440 / smMLCK ( chicken gizzard , residues 797 – 816 ) , 5 9 - TCAGAAGAAAATGGCAGAAAACAGGCCATGCTGTCCGAGCAATA - GGAAGACTGTCATCCATGTGAGC - 3 9 and 5 9 - GGCCGCTCACATGGA - TGACAGTCTTCCTATTGCTCGGACAGCATGGCCTGTTTTCTGCCA - TTTTCTTCTGA - 3 9 ; pME - CaM - KK - 440 / skMLCK ( rabbit skeletal mus - cle , residues 577 – 596 ) , 5 9 - TCAAGAGGCGCTGGAAGAAAAACTTCAT - TGCCGTCAGCGCTGCCAACCGCTTCAAGAAGATCTGAGC - 3 9 and 5 9 - GGCCGCTCAGATCTTCTTGAAGCGGTTGGCAGCGCTGACGGC - AATGAAGTTTTTCTTCCAGCGCCTCTTGA - 3 9 ; pME - CaM - KK - 440 / C - aM - KII ( rat , residues 296 – 313 ) , 5 9 - TCCGACGGAAATTGAAGGGTGC - CATCTTGACAACTATGCTGGCTACGAGAAATTTTTGAGC - 3 9 and 5 9 - GGCCGCTCAAAAATTTCTCGTAGCCAGCATAGTTGTCAAGATGG - CACCCTTCAATTTCCGTCGGA - 3 9 . pME - CaMKK - ( 1 – 448 ) and ( 1 – 434 ) were constructed as described previously ( 21 ) . For construction of Ile 441 - inserted CaM - KK chimera mutants , each chimeric mutant described above was digested with Eco RI and Not I and re - inserted into a newly digested pME18s plasmid , which was used as a template for mutagenesis . Mutagenic oligonucleotides are described as follows : pME - CaM - KK - 441 / skMLCK , 5 9 - AAGAACTCAGTCAAGCT - TATCAAGAGGCGCTGGAAGAA ; pME - CaM - KK - 441 / smMLCK , 5 9 - AA - GAACTCAGTCAAGCTTATCAGAAGAAAATGGCAGAA - 3 9 ; pME - CaM - KK - 441 / CaM - KII , 5 9 - AAGAACTCAGTCAAGCTTATCCGACGG - AAATTGAAGGG . The nucleotide sequence of each mutant was con - firmed by automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer . Transient Expression and Partial Purification of CaM - KK Mutants— COS - 7 cells were maintained in Dulbeco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum . Cells were subcultured in 10 - cm dishes 12 h before transfection . The cells were then transferred to serum - free medium and treated with a mixture of either 10 m g of pME18s plasmid DNA ( DNAX Research Institute , Inc . ) or CaM - KK cDNA containing plasmid DNAs and 60 m g of LipofectAMINE Reagent ( Life Technolo - gies , Inc . ) in 6 . 4 ml of medium . After a 32 – 48 - h incubation , the cells ( 3 plates ) were collected and homogenized with 1 ml of lysis buffer ( 150 m M NaCl , 20 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 m M EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 2 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 10 mg / liter leupeptin , 10 mg / liter pepstatin A , 10 mg / liter trypsin inhibitor ) at 4 °C . After centrifugation at 15 , 000 3 g for 15 min , the supernatant was diluted by the addition of twice the volume of 50 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 m M EDTA , 1 m M EGTA , 0 . 2 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 10 mg / liter leupeptin , 10 mg / liter pepstatin A , and 10 mg / liter trypsin inhibitor ( buffer A ) and then applied to a Q - Sepahrose column ( 0 . 5 - ml bed vol - ume ) , which had been pre - equilibrated with 50 m M NaCl containing buffer A . After washing the column with 10 ml of the equilibration buffer , CaM - KK was eluted by the addition of 0 . 5 ml of 0 . 6 M NaCl containing buffer A and stored at 2 80 °C . In Vitro Assay of CaM - KK Mutants— Either partially purified CaM - KK ( 1 m l ) from transfected COS - 7 cells or E . coli expressed GST - CaM - KK - ( 84 – 434 , 0 . 7 m g / ml ) was incubated with 10 m g of GST - CaM - KI - ( 1 – 293 , K49E ) at 30 °C for 5 min in a solution ( 25 m l ) containing 50 m M HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 10 m M Mg ( Ac ) 2 , 1 m M dithiothreitol , 100 m M [ g - 32 P ] ATP ( 1000 – 2000 cpm / pmol ) in the presence of either 2 m M EGTA or 2 m M CaCl 2 , 3 m M CaM . The reaction was initiated by the addition of [ g - 32 P ] ATP and terminated by spotting aliquots ( 15 m l ) onto phospho - cellulose paper ( Whatman P - 81 ) followed by washing in 75 m M phos - phoric acid ( 24 ) . Phosphate incorporation into GST - CaM - KI - ( 1 – 293 , K49E ) was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting of the filters . For each experiment , ; 10 - fold volume of partially purified CaM - KKs used in the assay was analyzed by Western blotting to check the amount of the enzymes . CaM - KK activity was measured for 5 min , which was under the linear condition . Others— Western blotting was carried out using antiserum ( 1 / 1000 dilution ) against a peptide corresponding to a conserved protein kinase motif ( residues 132 – 146 of CaM - KII ) , and the biotinylated - CaM overlay was done as described previously ( 4 ) . Detection was performed by using chemiluminescence reagent ( NEN Life Science Products ) . Protein con - centration was estimated by Coomassie Blue dye binding ( Bio - Rad ) using bovine serum albumin as a standard ( 25 ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We have previously identified the CaM - binding domain at the C - terminal of rat a CaM - KK ( residues 438 – 463 ) by using mutagenesis and a synthetic peptide ( Fig . 1 A ) ( 21 ) . Recently , a study using NMR spectroscopy has shown that the CaM - bind - ing peptide ( residues 438 – 463 ) of a CaM - KK bound to the N - and C - terminal domains of CaM in an opposite direction to all other known CaM kinases such as MLCKs and CaM - KII ( 22 ) . This result raised the possibility that CaM - KK is regulated by a mechanism distinct from that controlling other CaM kinases . Indeed , we have found that the CaM - binding peptide ( residues 438 – 463 ) of a CaM - KK is a weak inhibitor of the enzyme , when CaM - KIV activation assay was used to measure CaM - KK ac - tivity ( 21 ) . In this study , we performed a direct phosphorylation assay toward the GST - CaM - KI - ( 1 – 293 , K49E ) mutant as a substrate to determine CaM - KK activity . The use of this CaM - KI mutant has numerous advantages . First , CaM - KI lacking a regulatory domain ( including an autoinhibitory and CaM - binding domains ) is more suitable for measuring the Ca 2 1 / CaM sensitivity of CaM - KK . Second , substitution of Lys 49 by Glu abolishes the binding of ATP and allows us to rule out the possibility of a feedback phosphorylation of CaM - KK by activated CaM - KI , which would indirectly affect CaM - KK ac - Regulation of CaM Kinase Kinase 20091 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 22 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m tivity ( 26 ) . Finally , a direct phosphorylation assay allows us to perform kinetic analysis of CaM - KK activity . Thus we exam - ined the inhibitory effect of the a CaM - KK peptide ( residues 438 – 463 ) on the constitutively active mutant ( 84 – 434 ) of CaM - KK lacking both an autoinhibitory and CaM - binding do - mains ( 7 ) . As shown in Fig . 1 B , the peptide inhibits CaM - KK 84 – 434 activity with an IC 50 of ; 15 m M in the absence of Ca 2 1 / CaM . This inhibition is comparable to that obtained with the corresponding peptide from C . elegans CaM - KK ( residues 331 – 356 ) . Kinetic analysis indicated that the peptide inhibition of CaM - KK 84 – 434 was competitive with respect to ATP ( Fig . 1 B , inset ) but not to its protein substrate ( data not shown ) . When Ca 2 1 / CaM was added into the inhibitory reaction using 24 m M CaM - KK peptide , the activity of CaM - KK 84 – 434 was restored up to 80 – 90 % of its original activity in a dose - depend - ent manner ( Fig . 1 C ) . These results indicated that the CaM - binding peptide could also interact with the catalytic domain of CaM - KK and function as an autoinhibitory peptide . Previous mutagenesis study revealed that block mutation of either Lys 435 - Asn 436 - Ser 437 or Val 438 - Lys 439 - Leu 440 by triple Asp re - sulted in increased Ca 2 1 / CaM - independent activity ( 10 – 20 % of total activity ) , suggesting that these residues are involved in autoinhibitory function either directly or indirectly ( 21 ) . Be - cause constitutive activity of those mutants is low compared with that of fully constitutive active mutant ( 1 – 434 ) , we tested the possibility that other regions of CaM - KK , further C - termi - nal from residue 440 , could be important for autoinhibition .

C , partially purified truncated CaM - KKs ( ; 0 . 1 m g of protein ) were incubated with GST - CaM - KI - ( 1 – 293 , K49E , 0 . 4 mg / ml ) in the absence of Ca 2 1 / CaM for 5 min at 30 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” The experiment was per - formed in triplicate for each point , and the results are presented as the mean and S .

B , GST - CaM - KK - ( 84 – 434 , 0 . 7 m g / ml ) was incubated with GST - CaM - KI - ( 1 – 293 , K49E , 0 . 4 mg / ml ) without Ca 2 1 / CaM in the absence or presence of either a CaM - KK peptide ( residue 438 – 463 , 1 – 100 m M , closed circle ) or C . elegans CaM - KK peptide ( residue 331 – 356 , 1 – 100 m M , open circle ) for 5 min at 30 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” Inset , GST - CaM - KK - ( 84 – 434 ) activity was measured as described in A in the either absence ( open circle ) or presence of 20 m M a CaM - KK peptide ( residue 438 – 463 , closed circle ) using 50 – 400 m M [ g - 32 P ] ATP . The results are presented as double reciprocal plots ( Lineweaver - Burk ) .

The experiments were performed in triplicate for each point and the results are presented as the mean and S . E . of three experiments .

A recent study demonstrated that the truncation mutant of CaM - KK at Trp 444 , which turns out to be the an - choring residue to N - terminal domain of CaM ( 22 ) , was also inactive ( 27 ) . Based on these results , we postulated that the important residue ( s ) for the autoinhibition are located between residue 438 and 444 . We , therefore , constructed other truncated CaM - KK mu - tants ( Fig . 2 A ) and overexpressed them in COS - 7 . The expres - sion level of each mutant was analyzed by immunoblotting after partial purification on Q - Sepharose ( Fig . 2 B ) . Direct phos - phorylation assay toward GST - CaM - KI - ( 1 – 293 , K49E ) by each mutant was performed in the absence of Ca 2 1 / CaM ( Fig . 2 C ) . Consistent with previous observation ( 21 ) , a truncated version of CaM - KK at Phe 463 did not exhibit significant Ca 2 1 / CaM - independent activity compared with the wild - type enzyme . Further truncation from residue 448 to 441 generated detect - able but weak Ca 2 1 / CaM - independent activity , which is ; 20 – 25 % of fully constitutively active mutant ( 1 – 434 ) . Interest - ingly , truncation at Ile 441 resulted in complete constitutive activity of CaM - KK similar to that of 1 – 434 mutant . This result suggests that Ile 441 is essential but residue 435 – 440 may not be absolutely critical for CaM - KK autoinhibition . Our pre - vious result demonstrating a 10 – 20 % constitutive activity of CaM - KK after triple Asp substitution between residues 435 – 440 was likely because of the indirect effect of the mutation on the function of residue 441 . It is noteworthy that Ile 441 is conserved in b - isoform ( 8 , 9 ) and C . elegans CaM - KK ( 10 , 11 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . To confirm the involvement of Ile 441 in the regulatory mech - anism of CaM - KK , we mutated Ile 441 by Ala , Arg , or Asp in the F IG . 3 . Point mutation of Ile 441 in a CaM - KK .

The mutation of Ile 441 by Asp significantly reduced the binding ability of CaM compared with either wild type or other Ile 441 mutants ( Fig . 3 A , lower panel ) . This result is in accordance with the previous observation that the mutation of Val 438 - Lys 439 - Leu 440 by triple Asp reduced the binding ability of Ca 2 1 - CaM complex ( 21 ) . This is probably because of an intermolecular electrostatic repulsion , because there are many acidic residues in the region of CaM , which binds to the N terminus of the CaM - KK peptide ( residues 438 – 463 ) ( 22 ) . These results demonstrated that the CaM binding and autoin - hibitory regions in CaM - KK are overlapped at Ile 441 . Extensive mutagenesis studies indicated that most of the elements required for CaM binding and autoinhibition of MLCK and CaM - KII were located within the combined seg - ment but clearly separated because mutation of the CaM rec - ognition region has little effect on autoinhibition of the kinases ( 28 – 33 ) . Moreover , the CaM recognition sequence among ML - CKs and CaM - KII can be interchangeable ( 28 , 34 ) . This may be guaranteed by the fact that MLCKs and CaM - KII contain basic amino acid clusters located at N - terminal of the first hydropho - bic anchoring residue resulting in the same direction of CaM - binding ( 35 – 37 ) . In contrast , the three - dimensional structure of the Ca 2 1 - CaM complex with the CaM - KK peptide ( residues 438 – 463 ) has shown that the orientation of CaM binding to the peptide was opposite of that observed for MLCKs and CaM - KII . This difference can be due to the presence of a basic amino acid cluster ( Lys 451 , Arg 455 - Lys 456 - Arg 457 ) in the C - terminal region , which interacts with the negatively charged C - terminal chan - nel outlet of CaM ( 22 ) . To determine whether the proper orientation of CaM binding to CaM - KK was required for the regulation of the enzyme , we constructed chimera CaM - KK mutants that contained CaM - binding segment of either chicken smMLCK ( residues 797 – 816 ) ( 38 ) , rabbit skMLCK ( residues 577 – 596 ) ( 39 ) , or rat a CaM - KII ( residues 296 – 313 ) ( 40 , 41 ) based on the position of an N - terminal anchoring residue to CaM ( Trp 444 in CaM - KK , Trp 800 in smMLCK , Trp 580 in skMLCK , and Leu 299 in a CaM - KII ) ( Fig . 4 A ) . The clusters of basic amino acids , which are critical for the orientation of the binding of CaM to the peptide , are located at the N terminus of the CaM - binding sequence of each CaM kinase . Therefore , we fused each CaM - binding seg - ment with the catalytic portion of CaM - KK at Leu 440 . These chimera enzymes were expressed in COS - 7 cells and partially purified to analyze their enzymatic activities and Ca 2 1 / CaM binding by CaM overlay method ( Fig . 4 B ) . All of the chimeric enzymes retained the ability to bind Ca 2 1 / CaM as expected ( Fig . 4 B , lower panel ) . Unlike the wild - type and 1 – 463 mutant of CaM - KK , which are Ca 2 1 / CaM - dependent enzymes , all of the chimeric mutants expressed ; 60 % of constitutive activity ( Fig . 4 C ) . It is not surprising because Ile 441 , which is critical for autoinhibition described above , was replaced by a basic residue ( Arg or Lys ) in all of the chimera mutants . In the presence of Ca 2 1 / CaM , all chimeric enzymes slightly enhanced the CaM - KK activity suggesting that the CaM - binding region of each CaM kinase slightly blocks the catalytic activity . This is consistent with that Ile 441 mutants of CaM - KK , which exhib - ited 40 – 60 % constitutive activities and were further activated by the addition of Ca 2 1 / CaM ( Fig . 3 B ) . Finally we inserted Ile 441 into the boundary between the catalytic domain and CaM - binding region of each chimeric CaM - KK to examine Ca 2 1 / CaM dependence of the mutants ( Fig . 5 A ) . As shown in Fig . 5 B , all of the chimera CaM - KKs containing Ile 441 are virtually inactive in the absence of Ca 2 1 / CaM and are activated by Ca 2 1 / CaM to the same extent to the wild - type CaM - KK . These results demonstrate that the orien - tation of Ca 2 1 / CaM binding to the CaM - binding region is not critical for the relief of CaM - KK autoinhibition . Conclusion— The present mutagenesis identified Ile 441 as a critical residue for autoinhibition of a CaM - KK located at 2 3 position from Trp 444 , which is an anchoring residue to the N - terminal hydrophobic pocket of CaM . Three - dimensional structural analysis of Ca 2 1 / CaM binding ( 35 – 37 ) and sequence alignment of MLCKs and CaM - KII show that the residues at the 2 1 to 2 3 position from the N - terminal anchoring residue to CaM ( Fig . 4 A ) are basic in all of them . These residues are critical for the determination of the direction in which CaM is binding , as they interact with more negatively charged C - terminal domain than N - terminal domain of CaM . In the case of CaM - KK , substitution of Ile 441 by either Ala , Arg , or Asp resulted in increased constitutive activity ( Fig . 3 B ) , suggesting that a residue with a lower hydrophobicity at 2 3 position from Trp 444 caused suppression of the autoinhibitory function . Thus , a basic residue should not be located at a key position for the autoinhibition in CaM - KK . In agreement with this , the cluster of basic amino acid is located at the C - terminal portion in F IG . 5 . Effect of Ile 441 insertion on the activities of CaM - KK chimera mutants . A , schematic representation of wild - type and chi - mera mutant of a CaM - KK contained CaM - binding region of skeletal muscle MLCK ( 441 - skMLCK ) , smooth muscle MLCK ( 441 - smMLCK ) , or a CaM kinase II ( 441 - CaM - KII ) in which Ile 441 is inserted . Chimera CaM - KKs containing Ile 441 were constructed and expressed in COS - 7 cells followed by partial purification as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” Ile 441 in each chimera mutant is indicated by a box . Hy - drophobic anchoring residues to N - and C - terminal domains of CaM are indicated by asterisks . B , partially purified CaM - KK chimera mutants ( ; 0 . 4 m g of protein ) including wild - type and Mock were incubated with GST - CaM - KI - ( 1 – 293 , K49E , 0 . 4 mg / ml ) in the either the absence ( open bar ) or presence ( closed bar ) of Ca 2 1 / CaM for 5 min at 30 °C as de - scribed under “Experimental Procedures . ” The experiment was per - formed in triplicate for each point , and the results are presented as the mean and S . E . of three experiments . Inset , partially purified CaM - KK chimera mutants ( ; 3 m g pf protein ) including wild - type and Mock were analyzed by Western blotting ( indicated by arrows ) as shown in Fig . 2 B .

Regulation of CaM Kinase Kinase 20094 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 22 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m CaM - binding segment of CaM - KK ( Lys 451 , Arg 455 - Lys 456 - Arg 457 ) , resulting in an opposite direction of Ca 2 1 / CaM binding compared with other CaM kinases such as MLCKs and CaM - KII ( 22 ) , although the direction of Ca 2 1 / CaM binding itself is not critical for relief of the autoinhibition . This is supported by the result that all of the chimeric CaM - KKs lacking Ile 441 exhibited enhanced Ca 2 1 / CaM - independent activity ( Fig . 4 ) . Kinetic analysis of CaM - KK peptide inhibition raises the pos - sibility that Ile 441 interacts with the ATP - binding domain di - rectly and / or distort the ATP - binding site allosterically by in - teracting with the catalytic domain of CaM - KK . This might be analogous to Phe 307 in the CaM - binding domain of CaM - KI that interacts with Phe 31 in its glycine - rich ATP loop resulted in obstructing the nucleotide binding pocket ( 42 ) . We propose that the Ca 2 1 / CaM - binding segment of CaM - KK with an oppo - site orientation of CaM binding to other CaM kinases plays a key role for its autoinhibitory function through Ile 441 . Ile 441 is likely the residue released from the catalytic domain upon binding of Ca 2 1 / CaM to the regulatory region . Future studies including structural determination will be necessary to estab - lish the molecular mechanism of interaction between Ile 441 and the catalytic domain of CaM - KK and to determine how this residue contributes to the autoinhibitory function of CaM - KK .
