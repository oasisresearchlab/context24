Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo - 51 neutralization assay . 52 Results : COVID - 19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls , and 50 . 3 % 53 were hospitalized . ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had high diagnostic 54 accuracies with AUCs of 0 . 992 ( 95 % Confidence Interval [ 95 % CI ] : 0 . 986 - 0 . 996 ) and 0 . 977 55 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 963 - 0 . 990 ) , respectively . IgG assays outperformed IgA assays ( p = 0 . 008 ) . Taking an 56 assessed 15 % inter - assay imprecision into account , an optimized IgG ratio cut - off > 1 . 5 57 displayed a 100 % specificity ( 95 % CI : 98 - 100 ) and a 100 % positive predictive value ( 95 % CI : 97 - 58 100 ) . A 0 . 5 cut - off displayed a 97 % sensitivity ( 95 % CI : 93 - 99 ) and a 97 % negative predictive 59 value ( 95 % CI : 93 - 99 ) . Substituting these thresholds for the manufacturer’s , improved assay 60 performance , leaving 12 % of IgG ratios indeterminate between 0 . 5 - 1 . 5 . 61 Conclusions : The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG 62 against SARS - CoV - 2 in patient samples , with no obvious gains from IgA serology . The 63 optimized cut - offs are fit for rule - in and rule - out purposes , allowing determination of whether 64 individuals in our study population have been exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 or not . IgG serology 65 should however not be considered as a surrogate of protection at this stage . 66 .

Serological assays can complement diagnostic strategies focusing on the identification 71 of the infectious agent during the acute phase of disease . Unlike RT - PCR , they can identify 72 infected individuals that remained asymptomatic or undiagnosed , which are both frequent 73 conditions during SARS - CoV - 2 infection , long after the initial infection . Validated serological 74 assays are also key to understanding the ( immuno ) - pathophysiology of COVID - 19 in various 75 patients’ groups and will be critical to characterize responses elicited by the numerous vaccine 76 candidates in development ( 1 ) . 77 Designing serological testing strategies with high sensitivity and specificity and with acceptable 78 positive ( PPV ) and negative predictive values ( NPV ) is far from trivial , and requires taking two 79 major analytical aspects into account : analytical specificity and sensitivity ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) . The former 80 may largely be determined by the degree of cross - reactivity with other CoVs , which frequently 81 cause common colds in humans ( i . e . HCoV - 229E , - NL63 , - OC43 and - HKU1 ) ( 4 ) resulting in 82 seroprevalence rates usually above 90 % in adults ( 5 ) . 83 This cross - reactivity occurs when virus - specific antigenic epitopes are highly similar and 84 recognized by the same B cells . It is best defined by the proportion of “false - positive” SARS - 85 CoV - 2 results in individuals who were never exposed to this pathogen . In contrast to common 86 cold CoVs , the seroprevalence for MERS - CoV is low even in endemic countries ( 6 ) . Therefore , 87 cross - reactivity between MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 is not a critical factor when assessing 88 population seroprevalence . Previous studies have shown that antibodies against common cold 89 CoVs can cause considerable cross - reactivity in serological assays , depending on the type of 90 assay and antigens used . Particularly , whole virus - or nucleocapsid protein - based assays 91 showed a higher cross - reactivity compared to whole spike or S1 domain - based assays resulting 92 in lower specificity ( 4 ) . During the early phase of an outbreak , when SARS - CoV - 2 93 seroprevalence is low , serological testing strategies must have a very high specificity to reach a 94 high positive predictive value ( PPV ) and avoid false positive results . 95 On the other hand , analytical sensitivity is strongly influenced by the epidemic course , the 96 disease biology , and numerous analytical factors . All these interrelated items are primarily 97 influenced by the intrinsic immunogenicity of the SARS - CoV - 2 antigens and the magnitude and 98 duration of B cell responses elicited by infection , be it asymptomatic , benign , moderate or 99 severe ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) . 100 .

In this study , we 103 performed an extensive validation of a high throughput SARS - CoV - 2 commercial serological 104 platform quantifying both serum IgG and IgA against the S1 protein . As reference method , we 105 used a whole spike - based recombinant immunofluorescence assay ( rIFA ) ( 4 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8 ) . Selected 106 sera from SARS - CoV - 2 - infected patients were assessed for their neutralization capacity using a 107 pseudovirion assay ( see below ) . 108 109 Methods : 110 Aims 111 The aim of this study is to validate and define the operational cut - off values of a commercially 112 available ELISA - based SARS - CoV - 2 serological assay that could be applied at large scales to 113 reliably determine the presence of specific IgG as a marker of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . This study 114 used RT - PCR confirmed cases , but the goal was to be able to identify exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 115 by immunoassay alone . Therefore , the ELISA results were compared against recombinant 116 immunofluorescence assay ( rIFA ) , which was considered as the reference method due to its 117 demonstrated high specificity for serology of other CoVs such as MERS - CoV ( 6 ) . The 118 secondary goal is to assess the potential added value of IgA in patients recently infected with 119 SARS - CoV - 2 . 120 121 Study population 122 Negative control serum samples ( n = 176 ) were collected for various serological testing in our 123 routine laboratory and stored for analytical validation . These sera were collected in 2013 , 2014 124 and 2018 before the start of the outbreak and thus have not been exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 . 125 Sera ( n = 181 ) of PCR - confirmed COVID - 19 patients were collected at the University Hospitals of 126 Geneva from hospitalized patients ( n = 91 ) as well as from patients from the outpatient clinic 127 ( n = 90 ) . Ethical approval for all sera used in this study was waived by the local ethics committee 128 of the HUG that approves usage of leftover of patient serum collected for diagnostic purposes . 129 The number of days from symptom onset to blood collection was based on patient history 130 whenever this information was available or could be retrieved in a reliable way ; otherwise , we 131 used the date of RT - PCR positivity as a surrogate for onset of symptoms . Serum samples from 132 unmatched PCR - confirmed COVID - 19 hospitalized patients were collected for routine diagnostic 133 purposes under a general informed consent and outpatients were asked if they were willing to 134 .

Samples were immediately 140 processed and then frozen and stored at −20°C until ELISA , recombinant immunofluorescence 141 analyses , and pseudoneutralization were performed ( see below ) . Patients were sampled at 142 different times after onset of symptoms ( dpos ) or according to days post RT - PCR diagnosis 143 ( dpd ) if the onset was not known . To compare the seropositivity between different time points , 144 we grouped patients in the following dpos / dpd categories : 0 - 10 ( n = 8 , 4 . 4 % ) , 11 - 20 ( n = 112 , 145 61 . 9 % ) and 21 - 39 ( n = 61 , 33 . 7 % ) . 146 147 SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR analyses 148 SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR was performed according to manufacturers’ instructions on various 149 platforms , including initially in house method using eMAG ( bioMérieux , France ) and Charité RT - 150 PCR protocol ( 9 ) , then BD SARS - CoV - 2 reagent kit for BD Max system ( Becton , Dickinson and 151 Co , US ) and Cobas 6800 SARS CoV2 RT - PCR ( Roche , Switzerland ) . 152 153 Serum IgG and IgA ELISA 154 Both IgG and IgA enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) used the S1 - domain of the 155 spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 as antigen . Sera were diluted at 1 : 101 and assessed with the IgG 156 and IgA CE - marked ELISA ( Euroimmun AG , Lübeck , Germany # EI 2606 - 9601 G and # EI 157 2606 - 9601 A ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . They were run on Dynex Agility 158 ( Ruwag , Switzerland ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol . After adding the conjugate , 159 samples’ immunoreactivity was measured at an optical density of 450nm ( OD450 ) and then 160 divided by the OD450 of the calibrator provided with each ELISA kit to minimize inter - assay 161 variation ( 8 ) . The quantitative results obtained were then expressed in arbitrary units and 162 interpreted as follows : OD ratio : < 0 . 8 = negative ; ≥0 . 8 and < 1 . 1 = indeterminate ; ≥1 . 1 = positive . 163 Inter - assay variation was 15 . 6 % for IgG at a ratio of 2 . 09 ( n = 17 ) and 17 . 7 % for IgA at a ratio of 164 4 . 85 ( n = 7 ) . 165 166 Recombinant immunofluorescence assay 167 .

Briefly , Vero B4 cells were 169 transfected with the mammalian expression vector pCG1 - SCoV2 - S ( kindly provided by M . 170 Hoffmann and S . Pöhlmann , DPZ , Göttingen , Germany ) using Fugene HD ( Promega , # E2311 ) . 171 After 24h of incubation cells were detached and residual trypsin was removed by centrifugation 172 at 300x g for 5min . 50µl of transfected cells were seeded at a density of 2x10 5 / ml on multi - test 173 glass slides ( DUNN Labortechnik GmbH # 40 - 412 - 05 ) and incubated for 6h at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 . 174 Afterwards slides were washed 2x with PBS and fixed for 10min using ice - cold 175 Acetone / Methanol ( ratio 1 : 1 ) . For rIFA staining , slides were rehydrated for 10min using PBS + 176 0 . 1 % Tween20 ( PBS - T ) and blocked with 5 % milk in PBS - T for 30min at RT . Sera were diluted 177 1 : 40 in blocking buffer , 30µl were applied on each spot and incubated for 60min at 37°C or RT . 178 After 3x washing with PBS - T , secondary goat anti - human - IgG antibody conjugated with 179 Alexa488 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , # 109 - 545 - 088 ) was diluted 1 : 200 in PBS and 25µl were 180 applied to each spot . The secondary antibody was incubated for 45min at 37°C and slides were 181 washed 3x with PBS - T afterwards . Slides were briefly rinsed with dH 2 O and mounted using 182 glycerol . rIFA results were judged by 3 observers independently and the inter - observer kappa 183 correlation was 0 . 59 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 31 - 0 . 87 ) between observer 1 and 2 , 0 . 62 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 33 - 0 . 91 ) 184 between observer 2 and 3 as well as 0 . 75 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 52 - 0 . 99 ) between observer 1 and 3 , which 185 could be considered a substantial level of agreement ( 10 ) . 186 187 VSV - based pseudo - neutralization assay 188 VeroE6 cells were seeded in 96 - well plates at 2 x 10 4 cells per well and grown into confluent 189 monolayer overnight . Sera from patients were inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and diluted 1 : 5 190 in 120 µl DMEM 2 % FCS in the first column of a 96 - well plates ( in duplicate ) . Remaining wells 191 were filled with 60 µl of DMEM 2 % FCS . Two - fold dilutions were performed until 1 : 80 was 192 reached by moving 60 µl from one well column to the following one . VSV - based SARS - CoV - 2 193 pseudotypes ( generated according to Berger , Rentsch , and Zimmer ( 11 ) and Torriani et al . ( 12 ) ) 194 expressing a 19 amino acids C - terminal truncated spike protein ( 13 ) ( NCBI Reference 195 sequence : NC _ 045512 . 2 ) were diluted in DMEM 2 % FCS in order to have MOI = 0 . 01 in 60 µl 196 volume and added on top of serum dilutions ( final serum dilutions obtained were from 1 : 10 to 197 1 : 160 ) . The virus - serum containing plate was incubated at 37°C , for 2h . Vero E6 were then 198 infected with 100µl of virus - serum mixtures . After incubation at 37°C for 1 . 5h , cells were washed 199 once with 1X PBS and DMEM 10 % FCS was added . After 16 - 20h of incubation at 37°C , 5 % 200 CO 2 cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde solution for 15 min at 37°C and nuclei stained with 201 .

GFP positive infected cells were counted with 202 ImageXpress® Micro Widefield High Content Screening System ( Molecular Devices ) and data 203 analyzed with MetaXpress 5 . 1 . 0 . 41 software . 204 205 Statistical analyses 206 Analyses were performed with Graph Pad Prism version 8 . 3 . 1 software using Fisher’s bilateral 207 exact test and Mann – Whitney U ‐ test where appropriate . ROC analyses were performed 208 using ANALYSE ‐ IT ™ software for Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA , USA ) to : ( i ) confirm the cut ‐ off 209 values , prospectively proposed by the manufacturer , when compared to IFA results as the 210 reference method ( samples with very weak fluorescence signal just above background were 211 deemed putative negatives , and were considered as negative for the purpose of this analysis ) ; 212 ( ii ) compare the diagnostic accuracy of IgG alone , IgA alone , or both combined ; and ( iii ) 213 determine the optimal rule - in cut - off ( PPV of 100 % ) , a rule - out cut - off with a NPV above 95 % , 214 and an indeterminate interval , taking into account the analytical imprecision - derived least 215 significant change ( LSC ) . The LSC represents the smallest significant detectable difference 216 between two measurements based given the analytical imprecision , and is conventionally 217 defined as 1 . 96 * √2 * VC , ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) . AUC comparisons were performed according to the 218 nonparametric approach proposed by DeLong et al . ( 16 ) . Sensitivity ( SE ) , specificity ( SP ) , PPV 219 and NPV with the respective 95 % CIs are given . A value of p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically 220 significant . 221 222 Results : 223 The baseline demographic characteristics of the participants are summarized in table 1 . There 224 was a higher proportion of males ( 61 . 3 % ) vs females ( 38 . 7 % ) in COVID - 19 patients compared 225 to controls ( Fisher’s exact test , p = 0 . 002 ) . Among COVID - 19 patients , we included an equal 226 representation of hospitalized patients ( n = 91 , 50 . 3 % ) and outpatients ( n = 90 , 49 . 7 % ) . 227 228 Prevalence of IgG seropositivity according to rIFA 229 An in - house developed recombinant immunofluorescence assay ( rIFA ) using the whole spike 230 protein of SARS - CoV - 2 as antigen was used to assess spike - specific serum IgG . Since rIFA 231 was used as a confirmatory assay , we maximized its specificity by interpreting putative 232 negatives as negative to avoid false positive results . Among negative control samples , we found 233 no positive , five putative negative ( 2 . 8 % ) and 171 ( 97 . 2 % ) negative samples indicating a 234 specificity of 100 % . Among COVID - 19 samples there were 165 ( 91 . 2 % ) positive , two ( 1 . 1 % ) 235 .

Similar results were 238 found in hospitalized and outpatients . Thus , in our sample of 181 COVID - 19 samples , rIFA 239 proved a robust method for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 spike - specific IgG . 240 241 Diagnostic accuracies of IgG and IgA ELISA against rIFA 242 Overviews of OD ratios for IgG and IgA are shown in Figure 1 A and B , respectively . In control 243 sera , we found no positive , five ( 2 . 8 % ) indeterminate and 171 ( 97 . 2 % ) negative samples for 244 IgG , and 14 ( 7 . 7 % ) positive , 10 ( 5 . 7 % ) indeterminate and 157 ( 86 . 7 % ) negative samples for IgA 245 according to the manufacturer defined cut - off ( EI cut - offs ) ( table 2 ) . Considering the 246 indeterminate values as positive resulted in a specificity of 97 . 3 % ( IgG ) and 86 . 4 % ( IgA ) , 247 respectively . Analysis of COVID - 19 samples revealed 154 ( 85 . 1 % ) positive , one ( 0 . 6 % ) 248 indeterminate and 26 ( 14 . 4 % ) negative samples for IgG , and 164 ( 90 . 6 % ) positive , four ( 2 . 2 % ) 249 indeterminate and 13 ( 7 . 2 % ) negative samples for IgA . This resulted into an overall significantly 250 higher seropositivity for IgA ( 90 . 6 % ) than IgG ( 85 . 1 % ) in the S1 - based ELISA ( p = 0 . 041 ) . 251 252 Next , we analysed the seropositive rates of both ELISAs at different dpos or dpd ( Figure 1E ) 253 according to the EI cut - offs . Sera collected 21 dpos / dpd had a similarly high seropositivity for 254 both IgG ( 96 . 7 % ) and IgA ( 96 . 7 % ) ( p > 0 . 99 ) . A higher seropositivity was observed for IgA 255 compared to IgG for sera collected at 11 - 20 dpos / dpd ( 91 . 1 % vs 84 . 8 % , p = 0 . 0264 ) but not 0 - 10 256 dpos / dpd ( 37 . 5 % vs 0 % , p = 0 . 2 ) . No significant difference was found between hospitalized and 257 outpatients in IgG or IgA ELISA ( p = 0 . 833 , and p = 1 . 000 , respectively ) . 258 259 ROC curve analysis ( Fig 1 ; C and D ) indicated that overall , both IgG and IgA had a high 260 diagnostic accuracy with respective AUCs of 0 . 992 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 986 - 0 . 996 ) and 0 . 977 ( 95 % CI : 261 0 . 963 - 0 . 99 ) , respectively . Although modest , this AUC difference was found to be significant 262 according to the de Delong method ( p = 0 . 008 ) . Combining IgG and IgA ELISAs together ( AUC 263 0 . 986 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 976 - 0 . 995 ) tended to decrease the diagnostic accuracy of the model when 264 compared to IgG alone ( p = 0 . 080 ) , but outperformed IgA alone ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Although these 265 differences were modest , our results indicate that IgG ELISA displays the optimal fit with IgG 266 rIFA and that IgA did not improve diagnostic value . In a subgroup analysis considering only sera 267 harvested before 21 days after symptoms onset ( n = 120 ) , ROC curve analyses displayed similar 268 .

At these early 269 time - points , the AUC difference between IgG and IgA ratio was not significant ( p = 0 . 19 ) . 270 271 Thirteen patient samples had discrepant or potentially discrepant results , i . e . were negative or 272 indeterminate in ELISA and putative negative or positive in rIFA . To investigate this 273 discordance , we performed a VSV - based pseudovirus neutralization assay ( pseudo - NT ) for 1 ) 274 these 13 samples ( n = 13 ) , 2 ) five negative control samples , including one sample that showed 275 putative negative results in rIFA , and 3 ) seven patient samples that were positive by ELISA IgG , 276 IgA and rIFA ( table 3 ) . All samples that showed negative and putative negative rIFA results 277 were confirmed negative , whereas all rIFA positive samples were confirmed as positive by the 278 pseudo - NT assay ( table 3 ) . These findings support the accuracy of the rIFA and our decision to 279 count putative negative rIFA results as negative . 280 281 Optimizing the threshold for IgG serology 282 Taking into account the variation coefficient ( VC ) of 15 % at a low positivity IgG ratio ( 2 . 09 ) , and 283 assuming that such VC could at least be transposed to the 1 . 1 cut - off ratio , the minimal LSC 284 would be 0 . 42 . Added to the 1 . 1 ratio , an IgG ratio cut - off of 1 . 5 ( 1 . 1 + 0 . 42 ) would be the lowest 285 able to secure 100 % PPV while taking into account the analytical imprecision . Furthermore , an 286 LSC of 0 . 42 also indicates that the indeterminate zone proposed by the manufacturer ( between 287 0 . 8 and 1 . 1 ) should be reconsidered , as it falls within the analytical imprecision range . At the 1 . 5 288 IgG ratio cut - off , ROC curve analyses indicated that the SE was 86 % , the SP 100 % , and the 289 NPV 89 % . Thus , selecting a 1 . 5 cut - off , rather than the recommended 1 . 1 cut - off for IgG 290 seropositivity , allows the securing of a PPV of 100 % despite a 15 % imprecision . Higher VCs 291 would translate into a higher seropositivity cut - off to secure an identical PPV . For rule - out 292 purposes ( i . e . the seronegativity lower cut - off ) , the best trade - off IgG ratio cut - off was found to 293 be < 0 . 5 . At this value , the SE was 97 % , the SP 87 % , the NPV 97 % and the PPV 86 % ( table 4 ) . 294 This defines an indeterminate range between IgG ratios of 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 , which represented 43 295 cases ( 12 % ) of our samples ( including 20 control and 23 COVID - 19 samples ) . In this 296 indeterminate zone , all 20 sera from controls were confirmed as negative ( n = 19 ) or putative 297 negative ( n = 1 ) by rIFA . For indeterminate samples of COVID - 19 patients , five were negative , 298 one was a putative negative and 18 were positive by rIFA . 299 In the subgroup of patients whose samples were taken before 21 dpos , using the manufacturer 300 IgG ratio seropositivity cut - off ( 1 . 1 ) , the SE was 91 % , the SP 100 % , the PPV 100 % , and the 301 .

At the manufacturer seronegative cut - off ( < 0 . 8 ) , the SE was 91 % , the SP 100 % , the 302 PPV 100 % , and the NPV 64 % ( table 4 ) . Importantly , no patient displayed a ratio between 0 . 8 303 and 1 . 1 in this subgroup , preventing us from estimating the importance of the indeterminate 304 cases . 305 Using the aforementioned optimized IgG ratio cut - off for IgG seropositivity ( 1 . 5 ) , the SE was 306 82 % , the SP 100 % , the PPV 100 % , and the NPV 46 % . At the cut - off for IgG seronegativity 307 ( < 0 . 5 ) , the SE was 96 % , the SP 69 % , the PPV 95 % , and the NPV 73 % ( table 4 ) . The number of 308 undetermined cases between 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 IgG ratio values represented 17 % ( 20 / 120 ) of the 309 subgroup . Taken together , these results indicate that if the seropositivity cut - off of 1 . 5 for the 310 IgG ratio would be suitable for patients with sample taken < 21 days post symptoms onset , the 311 seronegative cut - off of 0 . 5 would display a non - optimal NPV for rule - out purposes . The optimal 312 seronegative ( NPV 100 % ) cut - off would have been < 0 . 4 , at the cost of a modest increase of 313 indeterminate cases to 20 % ( 24 / 120 ) . Thus , this assay performs best for convalescent samples 314 taken as of 21 dpos . 315 316 Discussion : 317 The key finding of this validation study , derived from a large cohort of laboratory - confirmed 318 SARS - CoV - 2 cases and unmatched negative controls , is that the present CE - IVD marked 319 immunoassay for IgG has a good diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0 . 99 and outperformed 320 IgA according to ROC curve comparisons . These results parallel the ones obtained by two other 321 smaller studies ( 8 ) , ( 17 ) , which tested the non CE - marked ELISA version and showed potentially 322 better diagnostic performances of IgG compared to IgA ELISA but lower AUCs compared to this 323 study . Our improved results might result from the higher number of negative controls and 324 COVID - 19 patient sera tested , and from the decreased non - specific background relative to that 325 observed in the earlier studies . Despite the greater performance of the IgG based ELISA , it was 326 reassuring to see that the IgA results correlated well with the IgG results and gave very similar 327 AUCs upon ROC analyses . However , knowing if and how IgA could be used in clinical practice 328 to further refine rule - in our rule - out strategies still remains elusive . 329 330 The second notable finding of this study is that the current manufacturer cut - offs are prone to 331 misinterpretations and should not be used without proper evaluation before routine testing . 332 Keeping in mind the challenges of developing a serological assay for a new viral disease in an 333 emergency situation ; securing both rule - in and rule - out cut - offs is key to mitigate the 334 unavoidable risk of false positive and false negative results due to the combination of a highly 335 .

Our analyses revealed the following limitations of the 337 manufacturer’s seropositivity cut - off . First , with an inter - assay imprecision of 15 % assessed at 338 an IgG ratio of 2 . 09 ( above than the 1 . 5 two cut - off value selected ) translating into a LSC of 0 . 42 339 IgG ratio , our results indicate that the analytical imprecision is higher than the range of the 340 indeterminate zone proposed by the manufacturer , which encompasses a delta of 0 . 3 IgG ratio . 341 This implies that any result within the 0 . 8 - 1 . 1 IgG ratio range could be randomly either above , 342 within or below these values just because of analytical imprecision . Secondly , with a LSC of 343 0 . 42 our results indicated that a higher IgG ratio cut - off value was needed to secure an optimal 344 specificity and PPV . Adding the 0 . 42 LSC to the 1 . 1 cut - off yielded a 1 . 5 ratio as the IgG 345 seropositivity cut - off with a PPV of 100 % , the lower end of the 95 % CI still being compatible with 346 a 97 % rule - in strategy . Notably , using this cut - off in the subgroup of patients under 21 dpos / dpd , 347 the SP and PPV were still 100 % , however , with broader confidence intervals . Similarly , in an 348 attempt to maximize the negative predictive value at the rule - out cut - off , the cut - off had to be 349 decreased from 0 . 8 to 0 . 5 IgG ratio in order to reach an overall NPV of 97 % , with a 93 % at the 350 lower end of the 95CI . In the subgroup of patients under 21 dpos / dpd this interval was found to 351 be substantially larger ( 95 % CI : 45 - 91 ) . Taken together , these results indicate that at this stage 352 the optimal rule - in cut - off should be set at > 1 . 5 of IgG ratio for seropositivity and at < 0 . 5 of IgG 353 ratio for rule - out purposes ( seronegativity ) . With these optimized “Geneva’s " cut - offs , the 354 indeterminate zone represented 12 % of the cases overall ( 20 controls and 23 COVID - 19 355 samples ) , representing a volume easily amenable to further confirmation tests like rIFA . 356 357 In this respect , the 13 discordant cases between ELISA and rIFA were tested using the pseudo - 358 NT assay . This indicated that all non - positive samples ( negative and putative negative ) by rIFA 359 were negative in the pseudo - NT assay , and that all positive samples by rIFA ( but ELISA 360 negative ) were positive in the pseudo - NT assay . One sample that was indeterminate in ELISA 361 and positive in rIFA was also positive in pseudo - NT . These findings may indicate an earlier IgG 362 antibody response , which could better mediate virus neutralization , against the S2 domain of the 363 spike protein , as previously suggested for SARS - CoV - 1 neutralizing antibodies targeting the S2 364 domain ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) . Although based upon a limited number of observations which 365 prevents us from drawing final conclusions , these results suggest that rIFA may be an 366 appropriate confirmatory assay in the future . 367 Regarding potential limitations , we need to highlight several additional points . We evaluated an 368 ELISA assay measuring antibodies against the S1 domain of the spike protein and not against 369 .

Such 370 factors could potentially explain why some samples were negative by ELISAs but positive by 371 rIFA , as the whole - spike protein is used in rIFA . Secondly , we strongly emphasize two important 372 cut - off limitations related to the analytical imprecision . At the level of the analytical imprecision , 373 the SARS - CoV - 2 IgG intra - individual biological variation being unknown , we had to use the LSC 374 instead of the reference change value ( 22 ) , which most likely would have translated into a 375 higher seropositivity cut - off . Along the same line , because the intra - lot imprecision of the 376 reagents is still undetermined , but expected to be higher than 15 % , this could have a similar 377 impact on cut - off determination . Nevertheless , these cut - offs implemented in routine testing at 378 the Geneva University Hospitals ( GE - cut - offs ) proved useful in the management of a number of 379 clinically compatible COVID - 19 patients with negative PCR results . 380 Importantly , this study is a diagnostic accuracy validation study and not a seroprevalence study . 381 This implies that the current seropositivity cut - off has to be considered with caution in population 382 studies . Indeed , the 100 % PPV achieved in this study was due to combined effect of a 100 % 383 specificity and a 1 : 1 distribution of control and samples form patients with positive SARS - CoV - 2 384 PCR . Therefore , in population seroprevalence studies with a lower expected proportion of 385 COVID - 19 , the PPV at the 1 . 5 cut - off will likely decrease . In this context , increasing the rule - in 386 IgG cut - off to a higher value or using a secondary specific confirmatory assay may become 387 necessary . Due to this limitation , at this stage we recommend the confirmation of all positive 388 ELISA results ( including ratios above 1 . 5 ) using a second serological assay such as rIFA for 389 seroprevalence studies with a low pre - test probability , and the confirmation of doubtful ELISA 390 results in settings with a pre - test probability around 50 % . A summary of our proposed testing 391 strategy is given in figure 2 . 392 393 In conclusion , in this validation study performed on 357 sera , of which 50 . 7 % came from 394 patients with COVID - 19 , we demonstrate a close to optimal diagnostic accuracy of IgG SARS - 395 CoV - 2 serology of the Euroimmun assay , without any obvious gains from IgA serology . Taking 396 analytical imprecision into account , we propose optimized cut - offs allowing a PPV of 100 % and 397 a NPV of 97 % to be secured with an indeterminate zone comprising about 12 % of the results , 398 for which additional rIFA analyses are currently necessary . Ongoing seroprevalence studies will 399 be instrumental to further refine the optimal rule - in and rule - out cut - offs , as well as the optimal 400 testing strategy , which may require a highly specific confirmatory assay . For the time being , this 401 assay seems to be fit for the purpose of enabling authorities to make informed decisions 402 regarding measures to be taken in order to manage the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic .

As a final caution , at this time simple IgG levels determined 405 by ELISA or rIFA cannot be considered as a surrogate of protection for individual patients . This 406 implies that risk mitigation decisions may not yet be based only on SARS - CoV - 2 ELISA / rIFA 407 serology . 408 409 Acknowledgements : 410 We would like to thank Markus Hoffmann and Stefan Pöhlmann ( DPZ , University of Göttingen ) 411 for providing a SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein expression vector .
