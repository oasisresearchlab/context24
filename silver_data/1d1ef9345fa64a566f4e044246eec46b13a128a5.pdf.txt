Introduction Binding of EGF to its receptor ( EGF receptor [ EGFR ] ) at the cell surface initiates a signal transduction process that involves a dynamic network of molecular interactions and modifications ultimately leading to cell survival , proliferation , and differentia - tion ( Schlessinger , 2000 ) . EGF binding also results in rapid internalization of activated receptors and targeting of internal - ized EGF – receptor complexes to lysosomes for degradation ( for review see Sorkin and Goh , 2009 ) . Acceleration of internaliza - tion and lysosomal targeting leads to receptor down - regulation , which serves to decrease the number of activated receptors in the cell and prevent excessive signaling . For instance , acti - vation of phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase and protein kinase B / AKT is thought to occur mostly from the plasma membrane and is , therefore , negatively regulated by endocytosis ( for review see Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . However , activated EGFR can continue to emit signals from endosomes . Specifically , endocytosis has been proposed to be necessary for the normal duration and intensity of the EGFR signaling to mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ; Vieira et al . , 1996 ; Teis et al . , 2006 ; for re - views see Fehrenbacher et al . , 2009 ; Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . Therefore , endocytosis can have multiple and possibly opposing effects on signal transduction processes . The analysis of the role of EGFR endocytosis in signaling has been difficult because the molecular mechanisms of EGFR internalization remain poorly understood , and experimental approaches to spe - cifically inhibit EGFR internalization have not been developed . In particular , mutants of EGFR that are not internalized but main - tain a full signaling capacity have not been generated . Endocytosis of EGFR has historically been and remains to be the most popular experimental system for the study of ligand - induced endocytosis . Endocytosis via clathrin - coated pits is the main pathway of activated EGFR internalization observed under most physiological conditions , although several examples of E ndocytosis of the epidermal growth factor recep - tor ( EGFR ) is important for the regulation of EGFR signaling . However , EGFR endocytosis mechanisms are poorly understood , which precludes development of approaches to specifically inhibit EGFR endocytosis and analyze its impact on signaling . Using a combination of receptor mutagenesis and RNA interference , we demon - strate that clathrin - dependent internalization of activated EGFR is regulated by four mechanisms , which function in a redundant and cooperative fashion . These mechanisms involve ubiquitination of the receptor kinase domain , the clathrin adaptor complex AP - 2 , the Grb2 adaptor protein , and three C - terminal lysine residues ( K1155 , K1158 , and K1164 ) , which are acetylated , a novel posttranslational modification for the EGFR . Based on these findings , the first internalization - defective EGFR mutant with functional ki - nase and normal tyrosine phosphorylation was generated . Analysis of the signaling kinetics of this mutant revealed that EGFR internalization is required for the sustained activation of protein kinase B / AKT but not for the activation of mitogen - activated protein kinase .

This mutant was used to demonstrate the impact of slow EGFR endocytosis on signaling dynamics , particularly , on the sustained activity along the EGFR – AKT sig - naling axis . Results Lys residues in the EGFR kinase and C - terminal domains play redundant roles in receptor internalization We have previously described an EGFR mutant with 15 Lys to arginine ( 15KR ) mutations in the kinase domain ( Huang et al . , 2007 ) . Despite negligible residual ubiquitination , 15KR was still internalized as efficiently as the wild - type ( wt ) EGFR , suggesting that receptor ubiquitination is not essential for internalization . Because there are six Lys in the C - terminal tail of EGFR ( resi - dues 1037 , 1075 , 1136 , 1155 , 1158 , and 1164 ) , we examined whether these Lys represent cryptic ubiquitination sites , which are undetectable by mass spectrometry ( MS ) and Western blotting , could be important for EGFR internalization . To this end , all six Lys were mutated to arginines in the wtEGFR and 15KR mutant , resulting in the 6KR - C and 21KR mutants , respectively ( Fig . 1 A ) . We found that measurements of EGF endocytosis rates in cells transiently expressing EGFR yield low rates when compared with the typical rate of CME and the endocytic rates of endoge - nous as well as stably expressed heterologous EGFR ( Fig . S1 ; Carter and Sorkin , 1998 ) . To accurately measure the endocytic rates , EGFR mutants were stably expressed in porcine aortic en - dothelial ( PAE ) cells that do not express endogenous EGFR and detectable amounts of other ErbBs . For each EGFR mutant , sev - eral single - cell stable clones were tested to account for potential clonal variability . Finally , internalization assays were performed using low , physiological concentrations of radiolabeled 125 I - EGF ( 1 ng / ml ; plasma concentration of EGF ) , conditions favoring EGFR internalization through the CME pathway . As shown in Fig . 1 B , 6KR - C mutant was internalized at a high rate . In contrast , several clones of 21KR - expressing cells internalized 125 I - EGF much slower than 15KR and wtEGFR - expressing cells ( Fig . 1 C ) . EGF - induced tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of 21KR mutants was similar to that of wtEGFR , which in - dicates that the decrease in the internalization rate was not caused by altered tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor ( Fig . 1 D ) . Overall , these data suggest that Lys within the C - terminal tail play a role in EGFR internalization only when ubiquitination of the kinase domain is eliminated . Therefore , we hypothesized that Lys within the kinase domain and the C - terminal tail of EGFR are involved in two redundant mechanisms of EGFR internalization . AP - 2 – binding motifs in the EGFR are involved in receptor internalization Because the 21KR mutant exhibits a 50 % reduction in the rate of internalization ( Fig . 1 C ) , additional mechanisms responsible for the residual internalization of the 21KR mutant must exist . The interaction of EGFR with the major cargo - binding protein complex in coated pits , AP - 2 , has been previously demonstrated , although functional experiments have shown that this interaction is not essential for EGFR internalization ( Sorkin et al . , 1996 ; Nesterov clathrin - independent EGFR endocytosis have been reported ( Yamazaki et al . , 2002 ; Sigismund et al . , 2005 ; Orth et al . , 2006 ) . Several conventional mechanisms of cargo recruitment into clathrin - coated pits have been tested for their role in EGFR internaliza - tion . An early study demonstrated interaction of EGFR with the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP - 2 ( Sorkin and Carpenter , 1993 ) . Classical tyrosine - based motif ( Y 974 RAL ) in EGFR is es - sential for this interaction , although an involvement of another AP - 2 – binding , dileucine motif ( Leu 1010 / Leu 1011 [ LL 1010 / 1011 ] ) in EGFR has also been proposed ( Sorkin et al . , 1996 ; Huang et al . , 2003 ) . However , functional assays demonstrated that neither the YRAL motif that interacts with the  2 subunit of AP - 2 nor the LL motif is necessary for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) of EGFR ( Sorkin et al . , 1996 ; Nesterov et al . , 1999 ; Huang et al . , 2003 ) . Testing the effect of AP - 2 depletion by siRNAs on EGFR internalization has yielded conflicting results , showing either an important role of AP - 2 ( Huang et al . , 2004 ; Johannessen et al . , 2006 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ) or lack thereof ( Motley et al . , 2003 ) . Another proposed mechanism of internalization involves cargo ubiquitination and interaction of the ubiquitinated cargo with ubiquitin adaptors in coated pits , such as epsin 1 and Eps15 . EGFR is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl , which binds to activated EGFR directly and indirectly through the Grb2 adaptor protein ( Levkowitz et al . , 1999 ; Waterman et al . , 2002 ) . However , the ubiquitin - based mechanism has also been ruled out as essential for EGFR internalization . First , mutation of 15 Lys residues in the kinase domain of EGFR , including six major ubiq - uitin conjugation sites , essentially abolished receptor ubiquitina - tion but did not affect the rate of EGFR internalization ( Huang et al . , 2007 ) . Second , siRNA depletion of epsin 1 alone or together with depletion of Eps15 and Eps15R did not specifi - cally affect the CME of EGFR ( Huang et al . , 2004 ; Sigismund et al . , 2005 ; Vanden Broeck and De Wolf , 2006 ; Chen and Zhuang , 2008 ) . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from the double – epsin 1 / 2 knockout exhibited normal EGFR endocytosis ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , a strong effect of epsin 1 knockdown on EGFR internalization in HeLa cells has been reported in a previ - ous study ( Kazazic et al . , 2009 ) . The latter study suggested that there might be cryptic ubiquitination of the EGFR Lys mutants , which could potentially mediate receptor internalization through interaction with epsin 1 . Controversies in the reported effects of EGFR mutagenesis and siRNA depletion of AP - 2 and epsin on EGFR endocytosis prompted us to test whether ( a ) ubiquitin - and AP - 2 – based inter - nalization mechanisms have a redundant function in EGFR endo - cytosis and whether ( b ) Lys residues in the EGFR outside of its kinase domain are involved in the ubiquitin - dependent endo - cytosis . Thus , we show that there are at least four either completely redundant or partially interrelated mechanisms that participate in EGFR internalization through clathrin - coated pits . These mecha - nisms involve ubiquitination of the receptor kinase domain , re - ceptor interaction with AP - 2 , C - terminal Lys residues , and Grb2 . Consecutive elimination of the molecular determinants in EGFR , which participate in multiple internalization mechanisms , led to the generation of a novel EGFR mutant that preserves nor - mal signaling capacity , yet is very slowly internalized and not 873 EGF receptor endocytosis • Goh et al . of the EGFR kinase , c - Cbl and Shc , to the extent similar to that observed in cells expressing wtEGFR ( Fig . S3 ) . Collectively , these data suggest that the defective internalization of 21KR  AP2 and other mutants is not caused by the impaired kinase activity . The clathrin - dependent endocytosis of EGFR has limited capacity and is saturated when high concentrations of EGF - occupied receptors are present at the cell surface . In turn , the satu - ration leads to the decrease in the specific internalization rate of EGF , as the contribution of a slow clathrin - independent endo - cytosis in the overall uptake of EGF is increased ( Lund et al . , 1990 ) . Because various clones of PAE cells express different lev - els of EGFR mutants ( Fig . S2 ) , saturation of the CME pathway et al . , 1999 ; Jiang et al . , 2003 ) . To investigate whether AP - 2 is one of the several mechanisms involved in EGFR endocytosis , two AP - 2 – binding motifs in EGFR , Y 974 RAL and LL 1010 / 1011 , were mutated in the 15KR and 21KR constructs ( 15KR  AP2 and 21KR  AP2 mutants ; Fig . 2 A ) . Interestingly , although mutations of these AP - 2 – binding motifs in wtEGFR ( wt  AP2 ) did not af - fect the internalization rate , the same mutations in conjunction with 15KR or 21KR mutations significantly reduced internaliza - tion rates of 1 ng / ml 125 I - EGF ( Fig . 2 B ) . Importantly , all mutants used in this study preserved normal EGF - induced tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . S2 ) . Moreover , upon EGF stimulation , 21KR  AP2 was capable of phosphorylating two direct substrates Figure 1 .

JCB • VOLUME 189 • NUMBER 5 • 2010 874 into clathrin - coated pit , an equilibrium - coated pit localization assay was performed as previously described ( Sorkina et al . , 2002 ; Jiang et al . , 2003 ) . Cells stably expressing similar levels of wtEGFR , wt  AP2 , 21KR , or 21KR  AP2 were transiently transfected with  2 - YFP to mark plasma membrane clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . The cells were incubated with 4 ng / ml EGF - rhodamine ( EGF - Rh ) at 4°C for 45 min to achieve an equilib - rium so that EGF - Rh binding to surface receptors and interaction of EGF - Rh – EGFR complexes with coated pit proteins could take place in the absence of endocytosis . Three - dimensional deconvolution image analysis revealed that EGF - Rh dots were often colocalized with  2 - YFP dots ( coated pits ) in cells ex - pressing either wtEGFR or wt  AP2 mutant , and the extent of EGF - Rh colocalization with coated pits was 10 – 11 % ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) . Surprisingly , 21KR mutant was also efficiently con - centrated in coated pits despite its slow endocytosis ( Fig . 4 A ) . In contrast , 21KR  AP2 mutant was diffusely distributed in the plasma membrane and accumulated in membrane ruffles with few examples of colocalization between EGF - Rh dots and  2 - YFP ( Fig . 4 A ) . The extent of colocalization of rhodamine and YFP dots in these cells was as low as 3 % ( Fig . 4 C ) . The discrepancy between slow endocytosis and normal re - cruitment of 21KR to clathrin - coated pits at 4°C could be a result of the long incubation of cells with EGF - Rh ( 45 min ) at 4°C , allowing the process of receptor interaction with coated pits to reach the equilibrium . Under such conditions , moderate differ - ences in the binding affinity of wtEGFR and 21KR to coated pits may not be revealed . For instance , internalization assay that in - cluded long preincubation of cells with EGF at 4°C did not reveal the effect of AP - 2 siRNA depletion on EGF internalization , whereas the assay using a short time course at 37°C did demon - strate a role of AP - 2 ( Motley et al . , 2003 ; Huang et al . , 2004 ; Johannessen et al . , 2006 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ) . There - fore , the efficiency of wtEGFR and 21KR recruitment into coated pits was compared by incubating cells with EGF - Rh for a short time ( 1 min ) at 37°C . Based on the time course of binding and internalization of 125 I - EGF , there is a substantial EGF binding to surface receptors at the 1 - min time point without significant inter - nalization . In contrast to experiments at 4°C , the extent of EGF - Rh can occur at different 125 I - EGF concentrations . Therefore , inter - nalization saturation experiments were performed using a range of 125 I - EGF concentrations ( 1 – 20 ng / ml ) to compare the maxi - mally high internalization rates among all clones . Consistently with the results of time course internalization assays using 1 ng / ml 125 I - EGF ( Fig . 2 B ) , progressive decreases in the maximum inter - nalization rate were observed as the redundant pathways were eliminated by mutations ( Fig . 2 C ) . Importantly , the maximum internalization rate of the 21KR  AP2 mutant was 20 – 30 % to that rate of wtEGFR . Altogether , these results suggest that ubiqui - tination of the kinase domain , C - terminal Lys , and AP - 2 – binding motifs all contribute to EGFR internalization process and likely represent the redundant mechanisms of this internalization . To further test whether AP - 2 and Lys residues function re - dundantly in EGFR internalization , the effect of AP - 2 depletion on the internalization of wtEGFR , 21KR , and wt  AP2 mutant was examined using siRNA targeting µ2 subunit of AP - 2 . AP - 2 can re - cruit cargo to coated pits by means of direct or indirect interaction with the cargo ( Traub , 2009 ) , and AP - 2 also has a general function in the formation of coated pits and vesicles ( McMahon and Mills , 2004 ) . Therefore , it is expected that depletion of AP - 2 would differ - entially affect endocytosis of a cargo that binds AP - 2 directly ( such as wtEGFR ) and that does not bind AP - 2 directly ( such as wt  AP2 mutant ) . Indeed , AP - 2 depletion reduced the internalization rate of both wtEGFR and wt  AP2 ( Fig . 3 A ) . However , the effect of µ2 siRNA on wt  AP2 receptor internalization was less ( 50 % de - crease ) than on wtEGFR internalization ( 75 % decrease ) , whereas AP - 2 was similarly depleted in both cell lines ( Fig . 3 B ) . This result is consistent with a model in which AP - 2 has a smaller contribu - tion to internalization of the wt  AP2 mutant as compared with wtEGFR because the former mutant does not directly bind AP - 2 . Furthermore , AP - 2 knockdown decreased the internalization rate of the 21KR mutant ( Fig . 3 A ) , which confirmed that AP - 2 inter - actions play an important role in endocytosis of the 21KR mutant . Internalization - defective EGFR mutants are poorly recruited into clathrin - coated pits To determine whether slow internalization of 21KR and 21KR∆AP2 mutants was caused by inefficient recruitment Figure 3 . siRNA depletion of AP - 2 decreases internalization of 125 I - EGF to a various degree in cells expressing wtEGFR , WT  AP2 , and 21KR receptors . ( A ) Internalization rate constants ( k e ) were measured using 1 ng / ml 125 I - EGF in wtEGFR , WT  AP2 , and 21KR - expressing cells that were transfected with nontargeting siRNA ( NT ) or siRNA targeting µ2 subunit of AP - 2 . Bars represent SEM from four experiments . ( B ) Lysates of cells used in internalization exper - iments described in A were probed by West - ern blotting ( WB ) with Ab32 to  - adaptin and actin antibody ( loading control ) . All images are from the same Western blot . The efficiency of siRNA depletion ( KD % ) was calculated as a percentage of the intensity of the  - adaptin signal in depleted cells to that intensity in non - targeting siRNA – transfected cells ( both signals were first normalized to the loading control ) . Black lines indicate that intervening lanes have been spliced out . 875 EGF receptor endocytosis • Goh et al . We have previously shown that during EGFR endocytosis , Tyr6 in the  2 subunit of AP - 2 (  2 - adaptin ) is phosphorylated by acti - vated EGFR and that this phosphorylation is strongly dependent on the LL 1010 / 1011 motif of the EGFR ( Huang et al . , 2003 ) . The interaction of the LL 1010 / 1011 motif with AP - 2 is likely of low affinity , as it could not be detected by coimmunoprecipitation , and the phosphorylation of AP - 2 can be considered as an indi - rect measure of the interaction . Therefore , the ability of EGFR mutants to phosphorylate  2 - adaptin was tested by immuno - precipitating AP - 2 from EGF - stimulated cells and probing the immunoprecipitate with phosphotyrosine antibodies . As shown in Fig . 5 A , wtEGFR and 15KR mutant phosphorylated AP - 2 localization in coated pits was two times lower in cells expressing 21KR mutant than wtEGFR , although EGF - Rh – occupied recep - tors were mainly clustered . ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . Similar to experi - ments performed at 4°C , localization of the 21KR  AP2 mutant in coated pits at 37°C was minimal ( 3 . 5 % ; Fig . 4 C ) . Collectively , these data suggest that the 21KR mutant is impaired in the ability to interact with coated pit proteins . Considering the hypothesis of the redundant role of EGFR Lys residues and AP - 2 – binding motifs , it is unclear why the 21KR mutant , which contains AP - 2 – binding motifs , is internal - ization impaired . One possibility could be that Lys residues and their modifications regulate receptor interactions with AP - 2 . Figure 4 . Recruitment of EGF - Rh into clathrin - coated pits is impaired in cells expressing 21KR and 21KR  AP2 mutants . ( A ) PAE cells expressing wtEGFR , WT  AP2 , 21KR , and 21KR  AP2 were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 . 1 –  2 - YFP . After 2 d , the cells were incubated with 4 ng / ml EGF - Rh for 45 min at 4°C and fixed . A z stack of optical sections was acquired through CY3 ( EGF - Rh ) and FITC (  2 - YFP ) filter channels and deconvo - luted . 21KR  AP2 was mostly localized to the ruffles at cell periphery .

JCB • VOLUME 189 • NUMBER 5 • 2010 876 peptide was detected in human head and neck squamous carci - noma cells expressing high levels of endogenous EGFR , although in these cells , the acetylation was EGF dependent ( unpublished data ) . Thus , it is possible that acetylation of the distal C - terminal Lys regulates EGFR internalization . Residual internalization of the 21KR∆AP2 mutant is clathrin and Grb2 dependent To obtain insights into the mechanisms of the residual internal - ization of the 21KR  AP2 mutant (  20 – 30 % wtEGFR ) , the effects of several siRNAs on endocytosis of this mutant were ana - lyzed . Knockdown of clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) substantially inhibited internalization of 21KR  AP2 ( k e = 0 . 05 min  1 ; Fig . 7 ) . Similarly , siRNA knockdown of the Grb2 adaptor , known to be important for ubiquitination and endocytosis of EGFR , strongly inhibited 21KR  AP2 internalization ( Fig . 7 ) despite a complete lack of detectable ubiquitination of this mutant ( Fig . S2 ) . siRNAs targeting several other proteins specifically implicated in EGFR endocytosis or capable of Grb2 binding , such as phospholipase D ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) , CIN85 ( Soubeyran et al . , 2002 ) , Tom1L1 ( Puertollano , 2005 ) , and intersectin ( Martin et al . , 2006 ) , did not affect internalization of the 21KR  AP2 mutant and wtEGFR ( unpublished data ) . These data suggest that there is at least an ad - ditional ( fourth ) mechanism underlying the CME of EGFR that requires Grb2 . Altered dynamics of AKT activation by the internalization - defective 21KR  AP2 mutant Although 21KR  AP2 mutant could still be internalized at a slow rate , the internalization rate of this mutant approximates the rate of constitutive endocytosis . Therefore , it is expected that EGF would not cause significant accumulation of the 21KR  AP2 mutant in endosomes . Analysis of the localization of this mutant stimulated with EGF - Rh at 37°C demonstrated that the appearance of the mutant receptor in endosomes containing EEA . 1 ( early endosomal antigen 1 ) was dramatically delayed as compared with cells expressing wtEGFR ( Fig . 8 A ) . 21KR  AP2 did not signifi - cantly colocalize with EEA . 1 for up to 1 h after EGF stimula - tion . This result confirmed that in cells expressing 21KR  AP2 receptor , most of the EGF - activated receptors remained at the cell surface , whereas in cells expressing wtEGFR , there was a large pool of EGF - occupied receptors in endosomes . Because nonubiquitinated EGFR mutants are not efficiently sorted to late to a similar extent , which indicates a similar extent of receptor interaction with AP - 2 . wt  AP2 did not phosphorylate  2 despite normal recruitment to coated pits and endocytosis , support - ing the hypothesis that this mutant utilizes AP - 2 – independent mechanisms of internalization ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Interestingly ,  2 - adaptin was only negligibly phosphorylated by the 21KR mutant ( Fig . 5 A ) , which suggests that this mutant very weakly and / or only transiently interacts with AP - 2 . The weak  2 phosphorylation by the 21KR mutant was not caused by the direct effect of C - terminal Lys mutations because the 6KR - C mutant displayed normal capacity to phosphorylate AP - 2 ( Fig . 5 B ) . In summary , the decreased recruitment into coated pits at 37°C and slow internalization of the 21KR mutant cor - related with its inability to phosphorylate  2 - adaptin . These data support the hypothesis that EGFR Lys and possibly post - translational modifications of these residues regulate the inter - action of the receptor with AP - 2 . Three distal Lys in the C terminus are critical for EGFR internalization and are acetylated To further elucidate the mechanism by which C - terminal Lys reg - ulate EGFR internalization , we tested which of these six Lys are responsible for the slow internalization of the 21KR mutant . Sys - tematic arginine to Lys add - back mutations in the C - terminal tail of 21KR were made , and several monoclonal lines in PAE cells were generated ( Fig . 6 A ) . Restoration of three kinase - proximal Lys ( 1037 , 1075 , and 1136 ) did not significantly rescue the inter - nalization rate , whereas add back of three distal Lys ( 1155 , 1158 , and 1164 ) rescued EGFR internalization to the level of internal - ization observed for wtEGFR and 6KR - C mutant ( Fig . 6 B ) . These data suggest that Lys1155 , Lys1158 , and Lys1164 are involved in the regulation of EGFR internalization . Individual and double mutations of these Lys did not significantly affect internalization of the 15KR mutant , indicating that the role of these three Lys is redundant ( Fig . 6 B ) . MS analysis of wtEGFR - expressing PAE and other types of cells untreated or treated with EGF did not reveal ubiquitin conjugation of C - terminal Lys . Surprisingly , a peptide encom - passing Lys1155 , Lys1158 , and Lys1164 , in which all three Lys residues were acetylated , was identified several times ( Fig . 6 C ) .

However , although AKT phosphorylation was sustained in wtEGFR - expressing PAE cells , the amount of phosphorylated AKT rapidly decreased to  50 % by the 15 - min time point in cells expressing the 21KR  AP2 mutant ( Fig . 8 , B and C ) . These data suggest that internalization is necessary for normal kinetics of AKT activation by EGFR . In contrast , phosphorylation of MAPK / extracellular stimulus – regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) in cells expressing 21KR  AP2 mutant was relatively long lasting when compared with wtEGFR - expressing cells ( Fig . 8 , B and C ) , suggesting that EGFR endocytosis primarily down - regulates ERK1 / 2 signaling . endosomes and remain in early / recycling endosomes ( Huang et al . , 2006 ) , enhanced recycling of the 21KR  AP2 mutant may amplify the effect of its slow internalization , thus resulting in its predominant cell surface localization . To assess whether activation of the internalization - defective 21KR  AP2 mutant results in altered signaling outcome , cells expressing wtEGFR or 21KR  AP2 mutant were incubated with 5 ng / ml EGF at 37°C . Western blot analysis of phospho - EGFR revealed prolonged phosphorylation of the 21KR  AP2 mutant as compared with wtEGFR ( Fig . 8 B ) . Both wtEGFR and the 21KR  AP2 mutant initially activated protein kinase B / AKT to the same extent , suggesting that the mutant receptor is Figure 6 .

JCB • VOLUME 189 • NUMBER 5 • 2010 878 maintained normal tyrosine phosphorylation and was capable of phosphorylating exogenous substrates ( Figs . S2 and S3 ) . The precise role of the three distal C - terminal Lys , which appear to be mainly responsible for the observed slow internal - ization of 21KR receptor , is unknown . The simplest explanation is that these Lys are ubiquitinated in the absence of major conju - gation sites in the kinase domain ; however , such ubiquitination is neither detected by MS nor by Western blotting . MS analy - sis instead revealed a novel posttranslational modification of EGFR by acetylation ( Fig . 6 C ) . Strikingly , Lys1155 , Lys1158 , and Lys1164 that are important for EGFR internalization ( Fig . 6 ) were the only acetylated Lys in the EGFR that were identified in our analysis . It is common that acetylation occurs at clusters of Lys residues that form positive patches , as it occurs in the distal C terminus of EGFR . Lys acetylation has been shown to regulate protein function in coordination with phosphorylation and ubiquitination ( Yang and Seto , 2008 ) . Thus , Lys acetylation may have either a direct , positive effect , or an opposite , inhibi - tory function on EGFR endocytosis , for instance , by competing with ubiquitination of these Lys . Unfortunately , all available acetyltransferase inhibitors were highly toxic to PAE cells un - der various experimental conditions , precluding the analysis of the effects these inhibitors on the endocytosis of EGFR mutants ( unpublished data ) . Finally , it is also possible that C - terminal Lys are a part of an internalization motif . For instance , the QQDFF sequence was shown to be capable of mediating CME ( Chang et al . , 1993 ) . Such a sequence ( residues 1149 – 1153 ) is present in the proximity to the three distal Lys of EGFR and can potentially regulate endocytosis in conjunction with these Lys . The role of yet another internalization mechanism that in - volves EGFR binding to AP - 2 was revealed when AP - 2 – binding motifs of EGFR ( Y 974 RAL and LL 1010 / 1011 ) were mutated in combination with the mutation of Lys in the kinase domain and C terminus . Although the YRAL motif is critical for the receptor Altogether , these data imply that EGFR endocytosis can have both positive and negative effects on its downstream signaling molecules . Discussion Since the first comprehensive analysis of EGF endocytosis ( Carpenter and Cohen , 1976 ) and cloning of EGFR ( Downward et al . , 1984 ) , > 1 , 000 publications have addressed the mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis and the role of endocytosis in EGFR signal - ing . This study provides an explanation as to why previous stud - ies produced many nonreconcilable models of these processes by demonstrating the extreme complexity of the clathrin - dependent internalization of EGFR , which appears to be mediated by several redundant and interdependent mechanisms . A hypothetic model of the EGFR CME is described in Fig . 9 . Ubiquitination of Lys within the kinase domain is one of the mechanisms that can promote EGFR internalization . Inhibi - tion of ubiquitination by mutating ubiquitin conjugation sites or Cbl - binding site ( Tyr1045 ) in the EGFR did not affect internaliza - tion , thus indicating that ubiquitination is not essential for recep - tor internalization ( Waterman et al . , 2002 ; Huang et al . , 2007 ) . Similarly , normal endocytosis of the ubiquitination - deficient mu - tant of the fibroblast growth factor receptor , another receptor ty - rosine kinase , has also been demonstrated previously ( Haugsten et al . , 2008 ) . However , add back of two major ubiquitin conju - gation sites restored the internalization of the ubiquitination and kinase activity – deficient EGFR mutant , providing the first indi - cation that ubiquitination of the EGFR kinase domain is capable of promoting receptor internalization under specific conditions ( Huang et al . , 2007 ) . In this study , the involvement of ubiquitina - tion of the kinase domain was revealed when Lys in the kinase domains and C terminus were simultaneously mutated ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . In this case , the internalization - defective EGFR mutant Figure 7 . siRNA depletion of Grb2 and CHC decreases internalization of 125 I - EGF in cells expressing wtEGFR and 21KR  AP2 mutant . ( A ) Internalization rate constants ( k e ) were measured using 1 ng / ml 125 I - EGF in wtEGFR and 21KR  AP2 - expressing cells that were transfected with nontargeting siRNA ( NT ) or siRNA targeting Grb2 or CHC . Error bars indicate SEM from three experiments . ( B ) Lysates of cells used in internalization experiments described in A were probed by Western blotting with anti - bodies to CHC , Grb2 , and actin ( load - ing control ) . All images are from the same Western blot ( WB ) . Black lines indicate that intervening lanes have been spliced out . 879 EGF receptor endocytosis • Goh et al . interaction with the LL motif . Poor phosphorylation of  2 - adaptin by the 21KR mutant ( Fig . 5 ) can be the consequence of weak bind - ing of this mutant to AP - 2 and , therefore , short residence time in coated pits or vice versa , which is a basis for the insufficient LL – AP - 2 interaction and coated pit recruitment of the mutant re - ceptor . It is possible that ubiquitination of Lys in the kinase domain and / or posttranslational modifications of C - terminal Lys may cause conformation changes in the EGFR molecule , leading to better ex - posure of AP - 2 – binding motifs , as was suggested for the interferon receptor ( Kumar et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , our model also implies that coated pit accumulation of receptors lacking AP - 2 binding , such as the wt  AP2 mutant , can be achieved by alternative , e . g . , ubiquitin - based , mechanisms . Finally , the residual internalization of the 21KR  AP2 mutant is controlled by yet another mechanism . siRNA analy - sis demonstrated that internalization of 21KR  AP2 is par - tially clathrin dependent and also requires Grb2 . It should be emphasized that Grb2 plays a role in all ubiquitin - dependent mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis by delivering Cbl to EGFR interaction with AP - 2 in cell lysates and in vitro , it is unlikely that this motif is involved in such interaction in the intact cell . A recent study suggested that the YRAL sequence is part of an  - helix and is not present in an extended conformation neces - sary for binding to the µ2 subunit of AP - 2 ( Jura et al . , 2009 ) . In fact , denaturing conditions and ionic detergents resulted in an increased interaction of the EGFR YRAL motif with AP - 2 ( Nesterov et al . , 1995 ; Sorkin et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , when YRAL motif was mutated , coimmuno - precipitation of AP - 2 with EGFR was not observed ( Sorkin et al . , 1996 ) . This suggests that the interaction between the LL motif of EGFR and AP - 2 is very weak and transient . In fact , the LL motif in EGFR lacks a negatively charged residue in the  4 position , which is frequently present in the LL - based motifs of other pro - teins . However , recent structure of AP - 2 complexed with the LL peptide suggested that such negative charge is not an absolute re - quirement ( Kelly et al . , 2008 ) . Importantly , this study also pre - dicted that phosphorylation of Tyr6 in  2 - adaptin would shift the AP - 2 complex to an active , open conformation capable of efficient Figure 8 . Poor accumulation of 21KR  AP2 mutant in endosomes and altered kinetics of ERK1 / 2 and AKT activation by EGF in cells expressing the internal - ization - defective mutant .

It is possible that the relative contribution of one of the internalization mechanisms may vary in different cell types and depend on experimental conditions . Importantly , the existence of multiple internalization mechanisms does not necessarily imply that all mechanisms are simultaneously used . Instead , one mechanism may be predominantly used under physi - ological conditions , whereas other mechanisms are used only when the main mechanism is inhibited experimentally or under pathological conditions . It is interesting that two rate - limiting steps of EGFR down - regulation exhibit drastically different robustness ( Fig . 9 ) . Unlike the internalization step , the endo - somal sorting to the degradation pathway is highly dependent on EGFR ubiquitination and , therefore , mainly controlled by a single , ubiquitin - based mechanism ( Levkowitz et al . , 1999 ; Huang et al . , 2006 ) . The first internalization - defective EGFR mutant with normal tyrosine phosphorylation generated in this study ( 21KR  AP2 ) is a novel and specific tool to investigate the role of EGFR endocytosis in signaling . As was observed with the EGFR mutants defective in lysosomal targeting ( Levkowitz et al . , 1999 ; Huang et al . , 2006 ) , degradation of activated 21KR  AP2 was substantially delayed as compared with wtEGFR ( Fig . 8 ) . However , in contrast to degradation - defective mutants , 21KR  AP2 mutant did not fully maintain AKT ac - tivity , suggesting that continuous activity of AKT requires EGFR internalization ( Fig . 8 ) . This finding contradicts the general assumption in the literature that the AKT activation pathway is mostly initiated at the plasma membrane , where phosphatidylinositol - ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - phosphate is generated , whereas the EGFR - ERK1 / 2 signaling can also be triggered from en - dosomes ( Haugh and Meyer , 2002 ; Sadowski et al . , 2009 ; for reviews see Wiley , 2003 ; Fehrenbacher et al . , 2009 ; Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . It is possible that endosomal EGFR is required for activation of a pool of AKT associated with Appl1 / 2 ( adaptor protein , phosphotyrosine interaction , PH domain , and Leu zipper containing – 1 ) , an endosomal pro - tein that recruits AKT and facilitates phosphorylation of its downstream substrate , glycogen synthase kinase - 3  in Rab5 - containing endosomes ( Schenck et al . , 2008 ) . Recently , an - other endosomal adaptor protein , WDFY2 , was found to be necessary for maintaining insulin - stimulated AKT2 phosphory - lation ( Walz et al . , 2010 ) . Finally , another possible explanation is that accumulation of internalization - defective EGFR at the cell surface triggers a negative feedback loop by up - regulating an AKT phosphatase , which results in down - regulation of active AKT . The role of endocytosis in ERK1 / 2 activation by EGF has been previously demonstrated using general inhibitors of CME ( Vieira et al . , 1996 ) , although other studies using the same in - hibitors produced conflicting results with regard to the role of endocytosis in ERK activity ( for reviews see Wiley , 2003 ; Fehrenbacher et al . , 2009 ; Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . In our experiments , ERK1 / 2 activation was not inhibited and even slightly prolonged in cells expressing the 21KR  AP2 receptor ( Fig . 8 ) . Thus , endocytosis of activated EGFR may primarily serve to down - regulate rather than enhance EGFR - ERK1 / 2 sig - naling . In summary , our experiments have taken the experimental ( for review see Sorkin and Goh , 2009 ) . In the case of the 21KR  AP2 receptor , it is likely that Grb2 links the recep - tor to coated pits through ubiquitin - independent mechanisms and unknown adaptors . In addition to its role in CME , Grb2 has been shown to be important for clathrin - independent en - docytosis of EGFR ( Yamazaki et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , Grb2 knockdown has the major inhibitory effect on the total uptake of EGF by wtEGFR and 21KR  AP2 mutant ( Fig . 7 ) . Lastly , early studies in mouse fibroblasts demonstrated that EGFR mutants with deletions of the C terminus at the position 1022 ( eliminating Grb2 - and Cbl - binding sites ) were rapidly in - ternalized in a kinase - dependent manner ( Chen et al . , 1989 ) , although the same mutants were internalized very slowly in PAE cells ( Jiang et al . , 2003 ) . These data suggest that in some cells , there might be yet another mechanism of EGFR internal - ization that requires kinase activity but does not require Grb2 binding , receptor ubiquitination , and a large portion of the C terminus . Finally , another level of complexity is added by the recent report of the clathrin - mediated but kinase - independent internalization of EGFR ( Frosi et al . , 2010 ) . In this case , inter - nalization is mediated by the protein called receptor - associated signal transducer ( RALT or MIG6 ) that is capable of binding to the dimerized EGFR , inhibiting its kinase activity and linking the receptor to coated pits through the interaction with AP - 2 and intersectins . In summary , our experiments reveal several redundant and , in some cases , interdependent mechanisms of EGFR inter - nalization involving AP - 2 , Grb2 , ubiquitination , and possibly Lys acetylation . The sheer complexity of EGFR internalization may help to explain discrepancies in the literature regarding the role of AP - 2 and ubiquitin adaptors like epsin in EGFR Figure 9 . Working model of EGFR internalization and lysosomal targeting . Grb2 / Cbl - dependent ubiquitination of the kinase domain ( mechanism # 1 ) and C - terminal Lys ( mechanism # 2 ) functionally interact with AP - 2 bind - ing of the receptor ( mechanism # 3 ) in contributing to 70 – 80 % of EGFR internalization . The CME ( mechanism # 4 ) involves other unknown Grb2 - related mechanisms . Clathrin - independent mechanisms of EGFR internal - ization constitute  5 – 15 % of the overall uptake of EGF – EGFR complexes into the cell . These mechanisms may involve Grb2 , actin - dependent mem - brane ruffling , and cholesterol - rich membrane microdomains ( rafts ) . 881 EGF receptor endocytosis • Goh et al . ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h at 4°C . The precipitates were washed twice with TGH lysis buffer supplemented with 100 mM NaCl and once without NaCl . Samples were resuspended in sample buffer and heat denaturated . For immunoprecipitation of AP - 2 , c - Cbl , or Shc , PAE cells expressing wt and mutant EGFR were stimulated with 100 ng / ml ( for AP - 2 ) or 20 ng / ml ( for c - Cbl and Shc ) EGF for 5 min at 37°C , and the cells were lysed as de - scribed previously ( Huang et al . , 2004 ) . AP - 2 , c - Cbl , or Shc was immuno - precipitated using AP6 , c - Cbl ( C - 15 ) , or Shc antibodies ( BD ) , respectively , for 3 h at 4°C followed by protein A – Sepharose beads ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or protein G – Sepharose beads ( Invitrogen ) for 1 h at 4°C . The samples were washed and heat denatured as described in the previous paragraph . To examine EGFR signaling , the cells grown in 35 - mm dishes were serum starved overnight , stimulated with 5 ng / ml EGF , and lysed in TGH lysis buffer without NaCl . The immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were resolved on 7 . 5 % SDS - PAGE . Proteins were transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane and probed by Western blotting with various antibodies followed by species - specific secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( The Jackson Laboratory ) . Detection of signal was performed with an en - hanced chemiluminescence kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . To determine the linear range of chemiluminescence signal , several x - ray films ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were analyzed , and the densitometric quantifications were per - formed using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) . MS PAE cells stably expressing wtEGFR were grown in 150 - mm dishes .

The peptides were separated by nanoscale reversed chromatography coupled to a mass spec - trometer ( LTQ - Orbitrap ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . MS / MS data were col - lected on a data - dependent method described previously ( Haas et al . , 2006 ) . Mass increment of 42 . 0106 ( acetylation ) was allowed on Lys resi - dues for MS / MS spectra matched to hEGFR using Sequest algorithm ( Eng et al . , 1994 ) . Internalization of 125 I - EGF Mouse receptor - grade EGF ( Collaborative Research , Inc . ) was iodinated as previously described ( Nesterov et al . , 1999 ) . In most experiments , the time course of 125 I - EGF internalization was obtained using 1 ng / ml 125 I - EGF , and the specific rate constant for internalization k e was calculated as the linear regression coefficient of the dependence of the ratio of inter - nalized / surface 125 I - EGF versus time as previously described ( Nesterov et al . , 1999 ) . This low concentration of 125 I - EGF was used to avoid saturation of the clathrin - mediated internalization pathway . In internalization saturation experiments , the k e values were determined for the range of 125 I - EGF con - centrations ( 1 – 20 ng / ml ) and plotted against the amount of surface 125 I - EGF – occupied receptors per cell . The latter value was determined at a 5 - min time point of the 125 I - EGF internalization assay as described previ - ously ( Huang et al . , 2006 ) .

Images are presented as obtained in Slidebook without changing  settings . Images were cropped to the final size using Photo - shop ( Adobe ) . To assess colocalization of EGFR with early endosomal marker , EEA . 1 , the cells grown on coverslips were treated with 4 ng / ml EGF - Rh at 37°C and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 12 min at room temperature . Fixed cells were mildly permeabilized with 0 . 02 % saponin in CMF - PBS containing 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature . Permeabilized cells were incubated with antibodies to EEA . 1 followed by secondary donkey anti – mouse IgG labeled with Cy5 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) . The cells were washed and mounted on glass slides using Mowiol and imaged as described previously ( Huang et al . , 2006 ) . Online supplemental material Fig . S1 shows the comparison of 125 I - EGF internalization rates between various cell lines expressing endogenous or transfected EGFR . Fig . S2 shows that EGFR mutants retain normal phosphorylation of Tyr1068 . Fig . S3 shows that 21KR  AP2 EGFR mutant induces normal tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of c - Cbl and Shc .
