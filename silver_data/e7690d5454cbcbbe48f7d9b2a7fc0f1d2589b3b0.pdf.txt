HopW1 from Pseudomonassyringae Disrupts the Actin Cytoskeleton to Promote Virulence in Arabidopsis Yongsung Kang . , Joanna Jelenska . * , Nicolas M . Cecchini , Yujie Li , Min Woo Lee ¤ , David R . Kovar , Jean T . Greenberg * Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology , The University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois , United States of America Abstract A central mechanism of virulence of extracellular bacterial pathogens is the injection into host cells of effector proteins that modify host cellular functions . HopW1 is an effector injected by the type III secretion system that increases the growth of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae on the Columbia accession of Arabidopsis . When delivered by P . syringae into plant cells , HopW1 causes a reduction in the filamentous actin ( F - actin ) network and the inhibition of endocytosis , a known actin - dependent process . When directly produced in plants , HopW1 forms complexes with actin , disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and inhibits endocytosis as well as the trafficking of certain proteins to vacuoles . The C - terminal region of HopW1 can reduce the length of actin filaments and therefore solubilize F - actin in vitro . Thus , HopW1 acts by disrupting the actin cytoskeleton and the cell biological processes that depend on actin , which in turn are needed for restricting P . syringae growth in Arabidopsis .

Essential for understanding dynamic host - pathogen interactions is the identification of critical components of the host defense machinery and the biochemical mechanism by which bacterial factors interfere with host functions . At least two types of molecules from plant pathogenic bacteria can trigger defenses : conserved patterns ( pathogen - associated molecu - lar patterns , PAMPs ) that bind to cell surface pattern receptors and more variable effectors that are injected by bacteria into the plants [ 1 ] . The perception by plants of some bacterial effectors occurs through the deployment of intracellular immune complexes [ 1 ] . A major consequence of bacterial effector activities is to promote virulence , which can occur when plants lack immune receptors for particular effectors . Some of the best - studied effectors are those that form the set of proteins introduced into plants through a type three secretion system ( TTSS ) [ 2 ] . Pseudomonas syringae is an extracellular pathogen that causes several types of foliar disease in agriculturally important plant species [ 3 ] . In the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana , pattern receptors and hormonal signals contribute quantitatively to defense against virulent P . syringae [ 1 , 4 , 5 ] . However , some P . syringae effectors can inhibit the action of receptors , accumulation and / or action of hormone / defense signals and other processes important for quantitative defense activation [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] . An emerging area of research has focused on cytoskeleton components as specific virulence targets of P . syringae . At least one effector , HopZ1a , acetylates tubulin in vitro and causes microtubule disruption in planta [ 9 ] . Treatment of plants with cytochalasins , compounds that prevent actin polymerization , increases the ability of several fungal pathogens to penetrate plant tissue [ 10 , 11 ] . Infection of Arabidopsis with P . syringae or treatment with PAMPs induces dynamic changes in actin filament density and bundling [ 12 , 13 ] . Application of a drug that depolymerizes filamentous actin ( F - actin ) causes increased growth of P . syringae in planta [ 12 ] . These observations raise the possibility that specific effectors target the actin cytoskeleton to disrupt actin - dependent immune responses . In plants , the actin cytoskeleton is important for various cell biological processes [ 14 ] that may be important for immune signaling , including endocytosis and the trafficking of some vacuolar proteins [ 15 ] . While specific P . syringae effectors that target actin have not yet been reported , injected virulence factors from several mammalian pathogens have been shown to directly interact with actin or modify cellular components that regulate actin [ 16 , 17 , 18 ] . Nearly a decade of research on effectors has uncovered several examples of P . syringae TTSS effectors that can interact with multiple host proteins . Whereas some interactions trigger immu - nity , others promote virulence [ 8 , 19 ] . The HopW1 gene , which resides on a multicopy plasmid in P . syringae pv . maculicola strain PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 1 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004232 ES4326 [ 20 ] , is an example of an effector that , when expressed in P . syringae pv . tomato , triggers strong immunity in the Arabidopsis Ws accession and N . benthamiana , but promotes virulence in the Arabidopsis Col accession [ 21 ] . HopW1 harbors an N - terminal domain that is also found in the N - terminal region of HopAE and a C - terminal domain found in a predicted effector from pathogenic E . coli [ 22 ] , both of unknown functions . The C - terminal domain of HopW1 is critical for triggering defenses and interacting with three HopW1 - interacting proteins ( WIN1 , WIN2 and WIN3 ) [ 21 ] . In the present study , we focus on a virulence function of HopW1 . Here , we identified actin as a major component of HopW1 - containing complexes purified from plants . We show that F - actin is a major virulence target of HopW1 that in vitro disrupts actin filaments and in planta disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and interferes with actin - dependent cell biological processes important for plant immunity . Results Actin Co - purifies with HopW1 To find components of HopW1 - containing complexes , we used LC - MS / MS to identify proteins that co - purified with HopW1 - HA that was transiently expressed in N . benthamiana . Thirteen unique peptides derived from actin ( covering 47 % of protein ) were identified from a co - precipitating band of 43 kDa that was absent in the control immunoprecipitation ( IP ) . We confirmed that HopW1 and actin formed a complex using IP and immunoblot - ting of extracts from N . benthamiana and Arabidopsis that transiently expressed HopW1 - HA ( Figure 1 ) . HopW1 does not have any know actin binding motifs or sequences that could help predict its activity . However , the high amount of actin in HopW1 complexes prompted us to investigate HopW1 influence on the actin cytoskeleton . HopW1 Disrupts Actin Filaments during Infection In eukaryotic cells , actin exists as both dynamic filaments ( F - actin ) and as a large pool of unpolymerized actin [ 23 ] . We used Arabidopsis Col expressing Lifeact - GFP ( green fluorescent protein ) that binds F - actin [ 24 , 25 , 26 ] to visualize the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 2A ) . We imaged F - actin by confocal microscopy in Col / Lifeact - GFP seedlings infected with Pto DC3000 containing HopW1 ( Pto DC3000 / HopW1 ) or a vector control ( pME6012 ) . We used ectopic expression in a heterologous Pto strain that does not a contain a HopW1 homologue , since we were not able to delete HopW1 from its native strain Pma ES4326 , where HopW1 resides on a large multicopy plasmid [ 20 , 21 ] . Ectopic HopW1 expressed in Pto DC3000 is functional : it confers increased pathogen virulence in Arabidopsis Col and reduced virulence in Ws , where HopW1 strongly triggers defenses [ 21 ] . Actin filament density was quantified as the percentage of Lifeact - GFP signal occupancy ( or density ) in confocal micrographs , as described in [ 12 , 25 ] . We observed a trend of a transient increase of F - actin density in cotyledons at 6 h after Pto DC3000 / vector infection and a later decrease at 48 h compared with a mock treatment ( Figure 2B ) , similar to a previous report [ 12 ] . Pto DC3000 / HopW1 infection or treatment with an inhibitor of actin polymerization , latrunculin B ( LatB ) caused a decrease in F - actin already after 6 h that persisted also at later time ( 24 and 48 hpi ) . The actin cytoskeleton was significantly more disrupted during infection with Pto DC3000 / HopW1 than Pto DC3000 / vector at 6 and 24 h ( Figure 2B ) . Thus , HopW1 causes an early disruption of the actin cytoskeleton during infection . The Virulence Effect of HopW1 Is Phenocopied by Latrunculin B If the actin cytoskeleton is a major target of HopW1 , a prediction is that pharmacological disruption of the actin cytoskeleton should phenocopy the virulence effect of HopW1 . Indeed , LatB treatment increased the growth of Pto DC000 on Arabidopsis [ 12 ] , an effect we also observed ( Figure 2C ) . LatB had the same magnitude of effect as HopW1 to increase Pto DC3000 growth on Col Arabidopsis ( Figure 2C ) . Pto DC3000 / HopW1 grew slightly more than Pto DC3000 / vector in LatB - treated plants . However , the additive effect was very small and might not be biologically meaningful . The results show that the net effects of HopW1 and LatB are similar , consistent with disruption of actin being responsible for increased pathogen growth . HopW1 Alone Disrupts the Actin Cytoskeleton in Plant Cells We directly expressed HopW1 in plant cells to see if it is sufficient to affect the actin cytoskeleton . When transiently co - expressed in N . benthamiana with Lifeact - GFP , HopW1 - RFP ( red fluorescent protein ) disrupted F - actin to such a degree that HopW1 was only detected in cells with very little Lifeact - GFP 36 – 40 h after Agroinfiltration ( Figure 3A ) . This pattern was seen in all cells with detectable HopW1 . At earlier times ( 16 – 24 h after Agroinfiltration ) , no fluorescent protein signals were detected . Plant cells in which the actin cytoskeleton was labeled with Lifeact - GFP lacked detectable HopW1 - RFP signals . In contrast , dense F - actin was present in cells with control mCherry ( Figure 3A ) . When Figure 1 . HopW1 forms complexes with actin in plants .

Such functions include the transport of cellular material to and from different cellular compartments . The plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae is extracellular and causes disease by injecting effector proteins into plant cells . One of these effectors is HopW1 , which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and reduces the transport of vesicles from the cell surface and proteins destined for vacuoles . The effects of HopW1 can be mimicked using a drug that inhibits actin polymerization . Thus , this work establishes a direct mechanism for pathogen disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and implicates actin - dependent events as important for controlling pathogen growth during infec - tion . P . syringae HopW1 Targets Plant Actin for Virulence PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 2 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004232 detectable , HopW1 - RFP accumulated in patches at the periphery of cells ( Figure 3A ) . Similar patterns were observed when HopW1 - RFP was transformed alone into N . benthamiana leaves without Lifeact - GFP ( not shown ) . Localization of HopW1 in patches may result from disorgani - zation of the actin cytoskeleton at the time when we can detect HopW1 . During the infection of Arabidopsis with Pto DC3000 / HopW1 or LatB treatment , most Lifeact - GFP marked filaments also disappeared from the cell interiors and the signal remained at the periphery ( Figure 3A ) . Similarly , in protoplasts from Arabidopsis Lifeact - GFP plants transiently expressing HopW1 - CFP ( cyan fluorescent protein ) , the F - actin cytoskeleton was absent 15 h after transformation and HopW1 - CFP was found in patches mostly along cell border ( Figure 3B ) . Only protoplasts with undetectable HopW1 - CFP signal had an intact actin cytoskeleton ( not shown ) . These data show that HopW1 is sufficient to disrupt actin filaments in plant cells . HopW1 - C Disrupts F - actin In Vitro To test whether the effect of HopW1 on the actin cytoskeleton observed in planta is direct , we assayed the activity of recombinant HopW1 on actin filaments in vitro . To evaluate the ratio of soluble to F - actin , we performed sedimentation assays after 30 min . incubation of pre - assembled F - actin with recombinant His - HopW1 - C ( HopW1 407 – 774 ) [ 27 ] . We used a truncated version of HopW1 because full - length protein was insoluble . We validated that actin co - purified from plants with full length and the C - terminal domain , but not with N - terminal domain , although HopW1 - C accumulated in planta at much lower level than other variants ( Figure S1 ) . HopW1 - C , but not E . coli extract or BSA , increased the amount of actin in the supernatant and simulta - neously decreased actin in the pellet ( Figure 4A ) , indicating a dose - dependent ability of HopW1 - C to solubilize F - actin ( Figure 4B ) . Sedimentation assays were corroborated by visualizing changes in the distribution of actin filament lengths after 1 h incubation with a range of HopW1 - C concentrations . There was a clear and statistically significant shift to smaller filament lengths as a function of the amount of HopW1 - C added to preassembled F - actin ( Figure 4C and 4D ) . These assays employed non - muscle actin . We did not detect disruption of muscle F - actin by HopW1 - C ( Figure S2 ) . Thus , HopW1 - C can directly disrupt non - muscle F - actin in vitro . HopW1 Disrupts Actin - Dependent Protein Targeting Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton may lead to disruption of intracellular trafficking that is essential for plant immunity [ 13 , 28 , 29 , 30 ] . As a first test of this possibility , we assessed HopW1’s effect on the trafficking of marker proteins . A functional Figure 2 .

These experiments were performed three times with similar results .

In the absence of HopW1 , both reporter proteins individually transfected to Col protoplasts showed patterns consistent with ER and / or vacuole localization ( Figure 5A , upper panels ) , as previously shown [ 14 ] . In contrast , in transgenic Arabidopsis protoplasts expressing dex - induced HopW1 , the normal patterns of SPO - GFP and AALP - GFP signals were disrupted at 12 , 24 and 48 h post transformation and HopW1 - dependent punctate patterns appeared ( Figure 5A , bottom panels ) . Control treatment with LatB to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton also caused similar punctate GFP patterns ( Figure S3A ) , as previously reported [ 14 ] . Quantitation of the GFP patterns showed that HopW1 ( and LatB ) significantly disrupted the normal localization patterns of AALP - GFP and SPO - GFP , respectively ( Figure 5B and S3B ) . Therefore , HopW1 prevents normal localization of proteins whose targeting depends on actin in a similar way as a drug that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton . HopW1 Disrupts Endocytosis A functional actin cytoskeleton is also critical for endocytosis and trafficking of vesicles [ 23 ] . We used the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 Figure 3 .

These experiments were repeated twice with similar results . The actin cytoskeleton was not detectable in all cells in which HopW1 - RFP / CFP was observed ( at least 30 N . benthamiana cells and 40 Lifeact - GFP Arabidopsis protoplasts , respectively , with HopW1 signal were observed ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1004232 . g003 P . syringae HopW1 Targets Plant Actin for Virulence PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 4 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004232 to monitor endocytic trafficking [ 31 ] in Arabidopsis protoplasts . Over time ( 0 . 5 to 2 h after dye application ) , increased numbers of endocytic vesicles were stained with FM4 - 64 in wild - type protoplasts . In contrast , FM4 - 64 failed to label vesicles in protoplasts from transgenic Arabidopsis expressing dex - inducible HopW1 ( Figure 6A and 6B ) . Endosomes labeled by FM4 - 64 were also significantly reduced in the LatB - treated versus control protoplasts ( Figure 6B ) . Thus , HopW1 affects actin - dependent cell biological events when directly expressed in plant cells . Infection Causes HopW1 - Dependent Disruption of Endocytosis We tested whether the delivery of HopW1 during P . syringae infection has a similar effect on endocytosis as HopW1 expressed directly in plant cells . To estimate when the inhibition of endocytosis might occur , we infected seedlings with Pto DC3000 / HopW1 or Pto DC3000 / vector , or treated seedlings with LatB as a positive control . We monitored endosomes stained with FM4 - 64 in Col cotyledons 1 . 5 , 6 , and 18 h after infection ( Figure 7A and 7B ) . The numbers of endosomes per cell labeled with FM4 - 64 were highly reduced at 6 and 18 h after infection with Pto DC3000 / HopW1 and similar to the effect of LatB treatment . In contrast , the number of endosomes was not different from mock treatment in early ( 1 . 5 – 6 h ) Pto DC3000 / vector infection , but was reduced by 50 % at 18 h . These results indicate that HopW1 is mainly responsible for the inhibition of endocytosis during early stages of infection , but Pto DC3000 may have another factor ( s ) that also weakly affects endocytosis at the later times . The timing of inhibition of endocytosis by HopW1 is consistent with disruption of actin cytoskeleton during infection ( Figure 2 ) . Discussion HopW1’s virulence activity is strongly linked to its effect on actin and actin - dependent processes in susceptible Col Arabidop - sis . Specifically , HopW1 co - purifies with actin from plants and can disrupt F - actin in vitro and decrease actin filament density during infection . Figure 8 shows a model for HopW1’s possible mode of action as a virulence factor . HopW1 inhibits actin - dependent cell biological processes in planta , such as endocytosis and the trafficking of certain proteins destined for ER and / or vacuoles . Surface receptors such as FLS2 or LeEix2 that recognize PAMPs and contribute to basal defense [ 32 ] are endocytosed upon activation [ 33 , 34 , 35 ] . Endocytosis of receptors requires an intact actin cytoskeleton [ 33 ] , but whether endocytosis per se is critical for FLS2 signaling to limit bacterial growth is not clear . Endocytosis of the tomato receptor LeEix2 is important for its immune signaling output [ 35 ] . Trafficking to the ER , disrupted by HopW1 , is necessary for replacement of endocytosed receptors at the plasma membrane [ 33 , 36 ] and secretion of antimicrobial factors [ 37 ] . Vacuole also has an established role in immunity [ 38 ] . HopW1 joins a growing list of pathogenic effectors from infectious bacteria that directly bind actin and / or regulate actin and thus actin - dependent processes [ 15 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 ] . However , Figure 4 . HopW1 - C disrupts F - actin in vitro . ( A ) HopW1 - C ( HopW1 407 – 774 ) causes a reduction in the size of actin filaments in vitro as assayed by sedimentation ultracentrifugation . Non - muscle F - actin ( 10 m M ) was incubated with HopW1 - C ( W1 - C , asterisks ) for 30 min , partitioned into supernatant ( S ) and pellet ( P ) fractions by ultracentri - fugation , separated by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . Greater than 90 % of actin was found in the pellet in the absence of HopW1 - C . In contrast , after incubation with 0 . 5 m M HopW1 - C , . 70 % of actin was in the supernatant ( note concomitant decrease of actin in the pellet ) . ( B ) F - actin disruption by HopW1 - C is dose dependent . Preassembled F - actin ( 10 m M ) was disrupted in the presence of different amounts of HopW1 - C , but not with the controls : phosphate buffer ( PB ) , BSA , and E . coli BL21 extract ( EXT ) after 30 min incubation . ( C ) Visualization of F - actin disruption . Mock ( 50 mM phosphate buffer ) ( i ) , BSA ( 0 . 5 m M ) ( ii ) , and different amounts of HopW1 - C ( iii to vii ) were incubated with 5 m M F - actin for 1 h . Filaments were stained with TRITC - phalloidin and observed by epifluorescence microscopy . ( D ) Quantita - tion of the reduced F - actin lengths . Actin filaments ( $ 100 ) from ( C ) were measured in each treatment . The distribution of lengths of F - actin was different for 0 . 03 m M to 0 . 5 m M HopW1 - C ( W1 - C ) treatments compared with buffer control ( mock ) , as determined by x 2 tests ( P , 0 . 0001 ) . These experiments were repeated three or more times with similar results . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1004232 . g004 P . syringae HopW1 Targets Plant Actin for Virulence PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 5 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004232 HopW1 is the first effector that we know of from a plant bacterial pathogen that directly targets actin . HopW1 can increase the growth of a P . syringae isolate that is already relatively successful in growing on Arabidopsis . This implicates an actin - dependent process ( es ) as important for imparting an immune response to limit the growth of pathogenic bacteria . Disruption of F - actin polymerization with LatB also increases susceptibility of the Col accession of Arabidopsis to Pto DC3000 ( [ 12 ] , this paper ) confirming the role of actin cytoskeleton in defense . HopW1 is not part of the Pto DC3000 effector repertoire , and thus we expect that there may be yet additional effectors from Pto DC3000 and / or other P . syringae strains that affect actin or actin - dependent processes . Recently , a study of actin dynamics during infection of Arabidopsis by Pto DC3000 implicated effectors as causing increased F - actin bundling late in the infection as part of the virulence mechanism , although no specific effector was identified Figure 5 .

We did not notice any effect of HopW1 on F - actin bundling . An early response to PAMPs and infection is an increase in density of actin filaments [ 12 , 13 ] , possibly to assist with higher demand for intracellular trafficking during defense . HopW1 counteracts this response by disrupting F - actin early during infection . HopW1 - C activity in vitro is specific for non - muscle ( cytosolic ) actin . Plant vegetative actin isoforms ( expressed in all vegetative organs ) are not more phylogenetically similar to non - muscle than muscle animal actins . However , they are functionally more related to cytosolic actins than to specialized muscle actins [ 44 ] . Cytosolic actin is essential for processes such as growth and intracellular trafficking in all eukaryotic cells . Our results confirm this functional similarity , recently reported by com - plementation of Arabidopsis vegetative actin mutants by human and protist cytosolic actins , but not by human muscle actins [ 44 ] .

A protein BLAST search indicates that the plant pathogen Acidovorax encodes a protein with similarity to the C - terminus of HopW1 ( eg . GeneBank accession no . YP 969911 ) . These homologs may also disrupt actin as part of their virulence mechanisms . HopW1 does not have recognizable features corresponding to any known actin depolymerizing or severing factors . However , its localization pattern in patches resembled that of actin - binding proteins involved in F - actin organization at the membrane : class I formins , such as AtFH4 [ 45 ] and NET proteins [ 46 ] . Future structural analysis may shed light whether HopW1 is an example of a structural mimic of a known activity or whether it disrupts F - actin by a wholly novel mechanism . Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains and Plasmids Bacterial strain and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables S1 , S2 . Bacterial Growth Assays In Planta Bacteria and / or 10 m M LatB were inoculated into leaves of 3 - week old Arabidopsis thaliana Col accession grown in soil for bacterial growth analyses , which were done as described in Text S1 . Immunoprecipitation , Western Blot and LC - MS / MS Analysis HopW1 - HA was immunoprecipitated with anti - HA matrix ( Roche ) from transgenic Arabidopsis or transiently transformed N . benthamiana as described Text S1 . LC - MS / MS protein identifica - tion after trypsin digestion of protein bands was performed at Chicago Biomedical Consortium as described [ 47 ] ; data was searched against the NCBI database using Mascot and validated with Scaffold 2 ( Proteome Software Inc . ) Evaluation of F - actin Arrays in Cotyledons after Infection To quantitatively evaluate actin filament populations , we calculated F - actin density in the cell as the percent occupancy of Lifeact - GFP signals based on the captured confocal microscope images . Transgenic Col / Lifeact - GFP [ 26 ] cotyledons were infect - ed with Pto DC3000 / empty vector or Pto DC3000 / HopW1 at OD 600 = 0 . 01 and 100 m M LatB was used as an actin cytoskeleton - disrupting control . Laser - scanning confocal microscopy was used to visualize Lifeact - GFP ( see Text S1 for details ) in infected epidermal cells . GFP fluorescence from Z - series maximum - intensity projections of 32 optical sections ( 0 . 5 m m each ) was separated from background by minimal threshold to include all F - actin signals . Images were analyzed by Image J software ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) as described [ 25 ] . Gaussian blur and high - band pass filter ( 1 – 5 pixels ) were applied as described in [ 12 , 25 ] . Actin filament density was designated as a percentage of total pixel numbers of F - actin ( as defined by Lifeact - GFP ) per total number of pixels in the photograph [ 12 , 25 ] . Picture regions without stomata were used for F - actin density calculation . Protoplast Isolation and Transient Transformation Arabidopsis protoplasts isolation , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) - mediated transformation [ 48 , 49 ] and microscopy were done as described in Text S1 . Protoplasts from at least two independent transgenic dex : HopW1 lines were used with similar results . Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 strain harboring pMDC43 - Lifeact ( F - actin marker ) and 35S - mCherry ( control ) or pGWB454 - HopW1 ( HopW1 - RFP ) were co - infiltrated into N . benthamiana leaves . 16 – 40 h after Agro - infiltration , leaves were analyzed by confocal microscopy . At least 30 cells with HopW1 - CFP signal were observed in 2 experiments 24 – 40 h after transformation . Monitoring Protein Trafficking in the Presence of HopW1 Constructs for in vivo organelle targeting reporter proteins ( AALP : GFP and SPO : GFP , kindly provided by Dr . Inhwan Hwang in Pohang University of Science and Technology , South Korea ) were transfected into protoplasts derived from Arabidopsis dex : hopW1 and control non - transgenic plants , and incubated in W5 buffer with 0 . 2 m M dexamethasone to express HopW1 . Protoplasts were monitored using confocal fluorescence microscopy Figure 8 . A schematic diagram of HopW1’s effects on plant cells . Model showing that the P . syringae effector HopW1 , secreted through the type three secretion system ( TTSS ) disrupts actin - dependent events that may be important for defense . Disruption of actin - dependent endocytosis may reduce active signaling from endosomes . It is also possible that disruption of actin - dependent vacuolar trafficking suppresses defenses by preventing efficient delivery of defense proteins to the vacuole or that some other actin - dependent defense process is disrupted . Proteins and possibly other molecules that are targeted to vacuoles have previously been implicated in various defense - related responses to infection [ 38 , 52 ] . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1004232 . g008 P . syringae HopW1 Targets Plant Actin for Virulence PLOS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 8 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004232 ( described in Text S1 ) at the various times ( 12 h , 24 h , and 48 h ) after transfection / dex treatment . Based on the digital images of transformed protoplasts , we categorized GFP patterns by the distributions of reporters as a vacuolar , an ER , and a punctate pattern , and then we counted and scored the distribution patterns of . 100 protoplasts . Endocytosis Inhibition Assay in Protoplasts and Cotyledons Protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis expressing dex : hopW1 or non - transgenic controls were incubated overnight with 0 . 2 m M dexamethasone and then stained with 6 . 4 m M FM4 - 64 ( Invitro - gen , Eugene , OR ) for 5 min and washed with W5 buffer . The protoplasts were then incubated for various times ( up to 2 h ) in W5 buffer at room temperature prior to fluorescence microscopy as described in Text S1 . To study endocytosis after infection , 6 - to 8 - d old Arabidopsis Col grown on MS agar plates were inoculated by placing a drop of Pto DC3000 / HopW1 or Pto DC3000 / vector cultures at OD 600 of 0 . 01 in 10 mM MgSO 4 or 100 m M LatB on each seedling , and incubated in a sterile hood for 30 min to allow the excess liquid to be absorbed by the seedling or evaporate . Seedlings were returned to the growth chamber for various times ( up to 24 h ) . Harvested cotyledons infiltrated with 8 . 2 m M FM4 - 64 ( Invitrogen , Eugene , OR ) using vacuum for 2 min , were incubated 1 h prior to microscopic analyses . Endosomes were manually counted in at least 10 plant cells per treatment per time point . Non - muscle F - actin Disruption Assays F - actin disruption assays followed manufacturer’s protocol ( Cytoskeleton , # BK013 , USA ) for sedimentation assays or fluorescence microscopy as described [ 50 , 51 ] in the presence of purified recombinant HopW1 - C ( Text S1 ) . Non - muscle actin was polymerized to filaments in 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM ATP , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 and 2 mM MgCl 2 for 1 h at room temperature . 10 m M preassembled F - actin was incubated with HopW1 - C or controls ( BSA or E . coli extract ) for 30 min . at room temperature and centrifuged at 150 , 000 6 g for 1 . 5 h . Pellet ( P ) and supernatant ( S ) fractions were separated by SDS - PAGE . To examine F - actin disruption by fluorescence microscopy , 5 m M preassembled non - muscle F - actin was incubated with different amounts of HopW1 - C or BSA for 1 h at room temperature and stained for 5 min with 1 m M TRITC - Phalloidin ( Fluka Biochemika , Switzerland ) . Reactions were terminated by a 250 - fold dilution in fluorescence buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM DTT , 20 m g / ml catalase , 100 m g / ml glucose oxidase , 3 mg / ml glucose , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , and 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) and absorbed to coverslips coated with 0 . 05 m g / m l poly - L - lysine . Fluorescence images were collected with a cooled CCD camera ( Orca - ER , Hamamatsu ) on an Olympus IX - 81 microscope . The lengths of at least 100 filaments per treatment were quantified using ImageJ software ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) . Supporting Information Figure S1 C - terminal domain of HopW1 forms com - plexes with actin in plants .

Complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti - HA agarose from dexamethasone - treated leaves and actin was detected by immunoblotting . - , not transformed control ; N , HopW1 - N - HA ( dex : HopW1 D 416 – 761 - HA ) ; C , HopW1 - C - HA ( dex : HopW1 D 19 – 417 - HA ) ; W1 , full length HopW1 - HA ( dex : - HopW1 1 – 774 - HA ) . Asterisks ( * ) mark bands corresponding to monomeric HopW1 - HA variants ( HopW1 and HopW1 - C are also detected in larger bands that may be dimers ) . Input was 3 % of extract used for each IP . This experiment was repeated 3 times with similar results . Note that accumulation of HopW1 - C is lower than other variants . ( TIF ) Figure S2 HopW1 did not disrupt muscle F - actin . Visualization of muscle F - actin . 0 . 5 m M of BSA ( i ) , or 0 . 5 m M of HopW1 - C ( ii ) was incubated with pre - assembled muscle F - actin ( from chicken breast ) for 1 h . Actin filaments were stained with TRITC - phalloidin and observed by epifluorescence microscopy . At least 100 actin filaments were measured from each sample and filament lengths were quantified ( right panel ) . This experiment was repeated twice with similar results . ( TIF ) Figure S3 Phenotypic effects of LatB on AALP : GFP and SPO : GFP localization . ( A ) Example of microscopic analysis of the effect of LatB on AALP : GFP and SPO : GFP localization . Protoplasts from wild - type plants were transfected with AALP : GFP or SPO : GFP and incubated in 10 m M of LatB . Localization of AALP : GFP and SPO : GFP was examined using confocal fluorescence microscopy per time point , in two biological repeats . In the presence of LatB , the distribution patterns of the AALP : GFP and SPO : GFP showed similar punctate fluorescence patterns similar to those caused by HopW1 . ( B ) Quantitation of the LatB - altered distribution patterns of AALP : GFP and SPO : GFP in Arabidopsis . Protoplasts were counted based on the distribution patterns in the presence and absence of LatB 12 h , 24 h , and 48 h after transfection from two biological repeats . Bars indicate SEM , x 2 tests indicated that the distributions were significantly different between the wild type and LatB treatment at each time point for each marker protein fusion ( P , 0 . 0001 , n $ 30 ) .
