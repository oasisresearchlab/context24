The commonly accepted assay to determine metastatic potential in vitro is the Boyden chamber assay , where the percent of serum - starved cells that can long - term transmigrate / invade through sub - cell size membrane - pores is quantified ; those experiments typically take 2 - 3 days . Those invasive cells are required to be pliable to squeeze through the small pores , yet they are also able to force their way through flexible microenvironments . We have previously shown that metastatic breast - cancer cells will deform and indent soft , impenetrable , elastic gels within 2 hours of seeding , without requiring serum starvation . Specifically , in cell lines with higher metastatic potential , a larger percentage of cells will indent gels and typically also to deeper gel depths . Thus , we are able to rapidly reveal mechanically invasive subpopulations , which are likely those that lead to high metastatic potential . By comparing the Boyden chamber and gel - mechanobiology assays , we show that the indenting cell subpopulations in the gel - assay are part of the group that successfully transmigrate through the Boyden chamber membrane ( 8  m pores ) . Thus , we are able to rapidly ( within 2 hours of seeding ) , using the standard cell media , provide a quantitative measure of the mechanical invasiveness of cells , which is correlated to the metastatic potential but is an independent parameter ; we evaluate numbers of indenting cells and their indentation depth . Moreover , the mechanical invasiveness assay allows focusing on specific ( invasive or non - invasive ) cells within the sample to identify specific surface markers , determine invasive mechanisms , and evaluate effects of applied drugs and treatments on the different subpopulations . Keywords : Mechanobiology , in vitro migration and invasion , cancer metastasis , Boyden chamber . Introduction Metastasis , the lethal spread of cancer in the body , causes nearly 90 % of cancer - associated deaths , despite major advances in molecular biology and genetics of cancer . Stages of metastasis include detachment from the primary tumor , invasion of surrounding tissue , intravasation and dissemination through the blood stream or lymph system , extravasation , and finally the outgrowing of a secondary tumor . This complex process is highly ineffective , yet cells may mutate to increase motility , plasticity and invasive capacities , attaining metastatic competence that results in successful invasion . These stages are marked by significant changes in gene expression , tumors markers and also varying cell - microenvironment interactions . The important roles of the cell microenvironment and the cells’ dynamic , mechanical phenotypes have recently been recognized in the context of metastasis . During metastasis the mechanobiology of the cells changes in response to external forces , by dynamically changing the cell mechanics or by modifying their microenvironment ( Butcher et al . 2009 ; Kumar and Weaver 2009 ) . The mechanobiology , cell mechanics , and cell - microenvironment mechanical interactions have recently been directly correlated with the metastatic potential in different cancer cell types . While tumors have been shown to be stiffer than normal tissue , single metastatic cancer cells are externally and internally softer ( Guck et al . 2005 ; Cross et al . 2007 ; Gal and Weihs 2012 ) . We have shown that metastatic breast cancer cells are softer , have a more sparse cytoskeleton and exhibit heightened internal dynamics ( Gal and Weihs 2010 ; Gal and Weihs 2012 ; Goldstein et al . 2013 ) . This also correlates with a reduction in the cell’s stiffness for more aggressive and motile cells ( Guck et al . 2005 ; Cross et al . 2007 ) . Differences in mechanics and physical properties of metastatic , cancer and benign cells have been demonstrated through different physical methods , such as optical stretcher ( Lincoln et al . 2004 ; Guck et al . 2005 ; Liese et al . 2007 ; Remmerbach et al . 2009 ) , flow cytometry ( Lincoln et al . 2003 ; Lincoln et al . 2004 ) , magnetic twisting cytometry ( Coughlin et al . 2013 ) , micropipette aspiration ( Mohammadalipour et al . 2012 ) and atomic force microscopy ( Cross et al . 2007 ; Li et al . 2008 ; Fuhrmann et al . 2011 ; Jonas et al . 2011 ; Plodinec et al . 2012 ; Lin et al . 2015 ; Staunton et al . 2016 ) . For example , high metastatic potential breast cancer cells ( MDA - MB - 231 ) have been shown to be more deformable than non - metastatic cells ( Guck et al . 2005 ) . When those cells were treated with all - trans retinoic acid , they became less deformable and less aggressive ( Wang et al . 2001 ) , and as a result , we showed , that their ability to apply force decreased ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) . The cells ability to dynamically apply force and rapidly change morphology is what facilitates their enhanced motility and invasiveness - their metastatic potential . The metastatic potential is conventionally evaluated in vitro using Boyden chambers . Cells that are able to cross the non - degradable membrane with pores smaller than their diameter are defined as more invasive ( Sahai 2005 ) . The interactions of cancer cells with their microenvironment have also been correlated with the metastatic potential , invasiveness and adaptability of cancer cells . For example , cell subpopulations with stem - like phenotypes are adhered less strongly and express markers of the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) ( Morata - Tarifa et al . 2016 ) , indicative of enhanced motility . Cancer cells typically migrate either mesenchymally ( by degrading the extracellular matrix ) or amoeboid fashion , where the aggressive cells can switch between the modes of motility when necessary ( Nguyen - Ngoc et al . 2012 ; Clark and Vignjevic 2015 ) . A rounded cell morphology is typical for cells that are seeded on a soft gel and also for cells exhibiting amoeboid - type migration ( Friedl 2004 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) ; actin rich protrusions are used by the cell to sense the microenvironment and initiate attachment ( Ilina and Friedl 2009 ) . In contrast , on a three - dimensional ( 3D ) matrix invasive cells assumed an elongated spindle - like morphology and present higher contractility when compared to their benign counterpart ( Koch et al . 2012 ) . By evaluating the mechanical interactions of the cancer cells with an elastic , initially flat polyacrylamide ( PAM ) gel , we have recently shown that cells are rapidly identifiable , and distinguishable from benign cells , ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Dvir et al . 2015 ; Massalha and Weihs 2016 ) ; the gel is physiological - stiffness and impenetrable , as it is non - degradable and has sub - micron pores . We have shown that while benign cells attach and apply small lateral traction forces only , metastatic breast cancer cells may apply either traction forces or a combination of normal and lateral forces , to indent and / or laterally pull the gel . We and others have observed that lateral traction forces exerted by metastatic cells increase linearly with gel stiffness on the range 1 - 11 kPa , while forces applied by benign cells appear to be stiffness - independent ( Kraning - Rush et al . 2012 ; Massalha and Weihs 2016 ) . Interestingly , we have observed that a subpopulation of the metastatic cells indent the impenetrable gels , when those are soft enough to push , yet stiff enough to grip ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Dvir et al . 2015 ) . The indentation depth attained by single , indenting metastatic breast cancer cells were 2 - 3 - fold larger on 2 . 3 kPa gels as compared to 1 . 3 kPa gels , and cells were unable to adhere to 0 . 5 kPa gels ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) . Thus , using cell - gel mechanical interactions , we were able to quantitatively distinguished between MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 468 lung metastases , breast cancer cell lines , respectively high and low metastatic potential cells , e . g . by indentation depths . Notably , these measurements are independent of the underlying tumor genetics , and rely only on the cell’s ability to apply force to their environment as an invasiveness measure . We note that it was a subpopulation of the cells that indented the gels , by applying repetitively larger - and - lower forces with time ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Dvir et al . 2015 ) . That shows the population heterogeneity and dynamics in the mechanical phenotype of the cells , likely indicating differences in invasiveness . Here , we show that the rapid and quantitative mechanobiology gel - based assay provides an important quantitative complement to the Boyden chamber transmigration / invasion - assay . Together these assays may be used to evaluate in vitro metastatic potential and the ensuing mechanical invasiveness of cancer cells on single - cell level . Both the Boyden chamber and our gel - mechanobiology assay reveal cancer cells that have high capacity to perform amoeboid invasion ; the focus of the gel - assay is on the mechanical interactions of cells with their microenvironment , providing a rapid ( 1 - 2 hours ) , quantitative measure of the cell - induced deformation on single - cell level . We show that the subpopulation of cells that migrate through an 8  m Boyden chamber membrane is also subpopulation that will deeply indent the gels ; the Boyden chamber effectively concentrates the more invasive cells which then indent the gels . Appropriately , we observe a larger invasive subpopulation in the MDA - MB - 231 cells as compared to the MDA - MB - 468 cells . Our approach can rapidly reveal subpopulations with mechanically invasive phenotype and may be used to identify and test new cell - specific targets for treatment . Materials and Methods Cell culture . We used MDA - MB - 231 ( HTB - 26 , ATCC , Manassas , VA ) and MDA - MB - 468 ( HTB - 132 ) both breast cancer lines from lung metastasis . Cells were cultured in DMEM ( Gibco , Carlsbad , CA ) media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , and 1 % vol . each of penicillin - streptomycin , 1 - glutamine , sodium pyruvate ( all from Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beit Haemek , Israel ) . Cells were maintained in an incubator at 37 o C , 5 % CO 2 and high humidity , and were used in passages 10 - 30 from stock . Polyacrylamide gel preparation . The gels were prepared according to an established protocol ( Raupach et al . 2007 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) . Glass coverslips , 30 mm diameter , # 5 thickness ( Menzel , Germany ) were hydroxylized using 0 . 1M NaOH and then activated with 3 - aminopropyltrimethoxysilan ( both Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , and fixed with glutaraldehyde after 24 hours . Gels were prepared on ice , by combining acrylamide ( 34 µ l of 40 % vol ) and BIS acrylamide monomers ( 3 . 8 µ l of 2 % vol ) ( both Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , in 203 µ l of distilled water , we obtain a gel with stiffness ( Young’s modulus ) of 2440±40 Pa , determined with an AR - G2 TA Instruments rheometer ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) . Prior to initiation of gelation , 2 µ l of 200 nm diameter , red fluorescent carboxyl - coated polystyrene particles ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) were added to the solution . Gelation was initiated with 1 : 200 vol . ammonium persulphate ( APS ) and catalyzed with 1 : 500 vol . of tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED ) . The gels were prepared by placing 25 µ l of the monomer solution inside a plastic frame ( Gene Frame , 25 μl , 10 × 10 mm , ABgene Thermo - Scientific , Waltham , MA ) adhered on the activated glass coverslip and covered by a plastic coverslip . Slow gelation was performed at 2 o C and under 300 g centrifugation ( Raupach et al . 2007 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) for 30 min . to confine the fluorescent nanoparticles at the gel surface . To facilitate cell adhesion , the surface of the gel is activated with Sulfo - SANPAH ( Pierce , Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and coated with rat tail collagen type I ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Glass coverslips with gels were kept under phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) at 4 o C until use . Gel rheology . The gel stiffness was determined using a TA Instruments AR - G2 rheometer ( New Castle , Delaware ) . To determine the shear modulus , gels were prepared directly on the rheometer plate and time sweep experiments were run ( oscillatory strain 0 . 5 % , angular frequency 3 . 14 rad / s ) using a 2 - cm parallel - plate fixture . The Young’s modulus , E , was determined by : E = 2 ∣ G * ∣ ( 1 + ν ) where G * , the complex shear modulus is equal to the elastic modulus , G * ≈ G ’ , since the gels are elastic ( G ’ > > G ” ) . Using a Poisson’s ratio of ν = 0 . 49 ( Takigawa et al . 1996 ) , the Young’s modulus is E = 3 | G ’ | . We used a gel with Young’s modulus of 2 . 4 ± 0 . 2 kPa , as was previously determined at our lab ( Massalha and Weihs 2016 ) . The gel’s Young’s modulus values exhibited small variation and high reproducibility between batches . This low variability is consistent with previous measurements on a wide range of polyacrylamide gels ( Abidine et al . 2015 ; Elosegui - Artola et al . 2016 ) , where rheology and AFM were compared and gels were homogeneous with linear mechanical properties . Boyden chamber , transwell - migration assay . We determined the number of serum - starved cells that cross through Boyden chamber membranes with 8  m pores . The transwell inserts were pretreated overnight with collagen type I ( 5 µg / ml ) at 4°C to facilitate cell attachment . Breast cancer cells were serum - starved overnight and 1 . 0×10 5 cells were seeded in 100  l of serum - free media in the upper compartment of the transwell inserts ( EDM Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . Serum full DMEM ( 10 % FBS ) in the lower chamber was used as a chemoattractant . Cells were allowed to migrate for 72 hours while incubated at 37 o C and 5 % CO 2 . The cells from the upper and lower compartments were collected , using trypsin or non - enzymatic cell dissociation , for comparison . Cell collection by Trypsin was performed by adding , respectively 200 µ l and 300  l of Trypsin - EDTA Solution A ( 0 . 25 % , Biological Industries , Cromwell , CT ) and incubating for 5 minutes ; a larger amount of trypsin ( same concentration ) was used to fill the Boyden chamber’s lower compartment , so as to reach the cells that have traversed the chamber and remain attached to the bottom of the membrane . The trypsin was neutralized by adding 800 µ l and 1 . 2 ml of DMEM growth media to the upper and lower compartments , respectively ; these amounts give a ratio of 1 : 4 trypsin - to - media . As trypsin may alter cell adhesion , we have also used the non - enzymatic Cell Dissociation Solution ( Biological Industries , Cromwell , CT ) . Cells from the top and bottom compartments were incubated , respectively in 200 µ l and 300  l for 10 minutes and then centrifuged and re - suspended in cell media . The cells from both compartments were compared , using two separate experiments : flow cytometry and the gel - based mechanical evaluation . For the gel - based experiment , to quantify the percentage of indenting cells we perform 4 different experiments with a total of 100 - 200 for control conditions and for the trespass and no trespass condition we evaluate between 350 - 500 cells in 6 different experiments . Indentation depth was measured for 50 - 100 cells for each condition . It is important to note that cells reaching the bottom chamber encounter serum - full media , which after 72 hours may induce significant cell division in cells that are not significantly migrating ; the doubling time of both the MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 468 is similar , at approximately 24 hours . Thus , we compare the percentage of indenting cells in each chamber , and not the numbers of cells . Flow cytometry . Cells from the upper and lower compartments of the Boyden chamber membranes were counted using a BD LSRII flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . We counted 10 , 000 events in 3 experiment for each condition in the two cell lines . Results were plotted on a dot plot of forward - scattered light ( FSC ) vs . side - scattered light ( SSC ) . We also used the flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability , by quantifying the percent of cells that stain with propidium iodide ( PI , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , a marker for dead cells , using 10 µ l / ml of a 10 µ g / ml stock PI solution . Count were based on 10 µ l volume of cell solution . Microscope imaging . Cells and gels were imaged using an inverted , epifluorescence Olympus 81X microscope using a 60x / 0 . 7NA differential interference contrast ( DIC ) air immersion objective . Images were captured using a XR Mega - 10AWCL camera ( Stanford Photonics Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) with a final magnification of 107 . 8 nm / pixel ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) . Gel - indentation experiments and depth evaluation . The number of indenting cells and depths were obtained by seeding cells on top of PAM gels ( 2 . 4 kPa Young’s modulus ) , within 2ml of cell media . We evaluated gel - indentations for two control conditions with all cells either under serum - starved or serum - full conditions . For the starved control experiments , cells on serum - starved condition , the cells were cultured for 24 hours on FBS - free DMEM media trypsinized and neutralized with standard DMEM media and placed on the gel for imaging . The serum - full control consisted of cells cultured for 24 hours with standard DMEM media . Controls were compared to gel - indentations induced by the two subpopulations of cancer cells obtained from the upper and lower compartments of the Boyden chamber , respectively , non - trespassing and trespassing ( transmigrating ) cells . Cells were imaged one hour after seeding on gels to allow attachment . We imaged several , random fields of view ( typically 10 - 30 ) , collecting three images at each location : ( a ) a differential interference contrast ( DIC , Nomarsky optics ) image of the cells on the gel , ( b ) a fluorescence image of the particles embedded at the gel surface , and ( c ) when a cell indented the gel , a fluorescence image was obtained at the lowest focal depth where the particles were in focus by eye ; these measurements were similar between different users ( averaged differ < 0 . 5  m ) and were also verified by confocal microscopy ( Dvir et al . 2015 ) , however we are currently also working on developing an automated image processing procedure for this step . The percent of indenting cells in every experiment was quantified . The focal height difference between the two fluorescence images provided the depth of indentation ( see e . g . , Figure 2 ) . Statistical analysis . Results are displayed as the mean ± the standard deviation . We average four gel - indentation experiments with a total of hundreds of cells for each cell line in each condition . A two - way ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction was conducted to evaluate the effect of cell type and the condition ( i . e . , control , starved control , trespass , no - trespass , and cell dissociation method ) using a confidence level of 95 % . Null hypothesis are identified by p - values less than 0 . 05 . Results We show that the mechanical invasiveness of metastatic cells on the synthetic gel system directly correlates and complements with the Boyden chamber assay , providing an enhanced measure of the mechanical , metastatic competence of the cells , on the single cell level . We compare and also combine the two in vitro assays : the Boyden chamber transmigration / invasion assay and our gel - based mechanobiological invasiveness assay . Concurrently , we determine the direct correlation between cancer cell migratory and mechanical indentation abilities . We compare the populations of cells that are able to cross an 8  m Boyden chamber and those that actively indent a soft , elastic and impenetrable polyacrylamide gel , showing the direct correlation ( Figure 1 ) . Following 72 hr interaction with the Boyden chamber , we collect the subsets of cells from the upper and lower compartments of the Boyden chamber , respectively , providing the non - trespassing and trespassing ( transmigrated ) cell fractions . We evaluate indentations induced by the two fractions with those induced by the entire cell population in serum full and serum starved control , to match the Boyden chamber conditions where cells are serum starved 24 hrs prior to seeding . Flow cytometry counting showed that 69±3 % and 48±1 % , respectively , of the seeded MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 468 breast cancer cells successfully transmigrated through the 8  m membrane . Viability was determined by PI staining of ( initially serum starved ) cells collected from the upper and lower chambers of the Boyden membrane , and cells in both compartments were over 95 % viable ( Figure S1 ) . The two fractions , trespassing and non - trespassing cells , and whole cell - populations controls ( serum full and overnight serum - starved ) were seeded on the PAM gels to evaluate the mechanical interactions . The cell mechanical interactions with the PAM gel included evaluation of two parameters : the percentage of indenting cells and the biomechanically induced indentation depth . We observe that a subset of the MDA - MB - 468 and MDA - MB - 231 cell populations ( respectively 35 % and 50 % ) indent the 2 . 4 kPa PAM gels , likely in attempted invasion ; we have previously shown that benign cells do not significantly indent the gels ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Dvir et al . 2015 ) . The gels are impenetrable to the cells , being non - degradable and with sub - micron pores , yet already 1 hour after seeding , single , metastatic breast cancer cells measurably indent the gel . The indentation is apparent as a cell pushes the gel surface downwards to a lower focal plane . Figure 2 shows examples of indenting and non - indenting cells seeded on the PAM gels . Figure 3 shows the percentage of MDA - MB - 468 and MDA - MB - 231 cells that indent the PAM gel under control conditions and following Boyden chamber migration . The two whole cell - population controls ( serum full and serum starved ) were indistinguishable , indicating that the cell’s gel - indentation capability is not affected by serum starvation . We observe that the non - trespassing subpopulation exhibited a similar percentage of indenting MDA - MB - 468 cells and a reduction in the indenting MDA - MB - 231 cells , both with wider variability ; this population is expected to be less migratory and less invasive . We have also evaluated the effect of the dissociating solution , as that may affect cell adhesion . Compared the percent of indenting cells following Boyden chamber interaction , collected using trypsin or using a non - enzymatic Cell Dissociation Solution , we observed a larger percentage of indenting cells when using the non - enzymatic cell dissociation . However , the results were qualitatively similar using both collection approaches , and thus we focus on the observed phenomena in general . Most importantly , we note that for both cell types , regardless of the cell collection method , the cells that have trespassed through the Boyden chamber exhibit a high percentage of indenting cells ( > 70 % ) , indicating a direct correlation between the Boyden migration and gel indentation . Remarkably , by performing a simple calculation , for example with the trypsinized MDA - MB - 468 cells , we observe that since 48±10 % of the cells trespassed the Boyden chamber , and 75±3 % ( N = 351 ) of those then indented the gels , 48 % * 75 % = 36 % , which is in fact the percentage of the indenting cells in the overall population ; in the trypsinized MDA - MB - 231 cells , it is 69±3 % trespassing and 72±13 % ( N = 468 ) indenting to give 50 % of the overall population . This suggest that the Boyden chamber is “concentrating” the more migratory and invasive cells , which are then more likely to indent the gels . We observed a wide distribution of indentation depths induced in the gels by both MDA - MB - 468 and MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cell lines , where the maximal depth following interaction with the Boyden chamber was higher than controls ( Figure 4 ) ; indentation depths following use of the cell dissociation solution are in Figure S2 . The measured indentation depths ( up to 12 μm in controls ) are significantly larger than previously observed dimples ( < 1 μm ) exhibited by non - cancerous cells that spread ( Hur et al . 2009 ) or crawl ( Delanoe - Ayari et al . 2010 ) ; those dimple likely result from mostly traction forces that locally bend the gels . To evaluate the number of “intentionally” indenting metastatic cells , we have set a threshold indentation depth of 2 . 5 μm , the maximum depth that we had previously observed in benign breast cells ( Dvir et al . 2015 ) . Regardless , indentation depths between 0 . 5 - 2 . 5 μm represent less than 6 % of the indenting cells in both cell lines . We observe that the serum - full and serum - starved controls are again indistinguishable , where the distributions of the indentation depths were statistically indistinguishable . In contrast , cells that were seeded in the Boyden chambers exhibited wider distributions , reaching larger indentation depths than both controls , regardless of whether the cells trespassed . Notably , in the subpopulation of cells that did trespass the Boyden chamber , the average depth also increased , as compared to the controls and the non - trespassing subpopulation . Discussion Our results show that the gel - based system provide an important complementary measure to be combined with the Boyden chamber assay , revealing different aspects of cell invasiveness . The results shown here provide a preliminary indication towards potential use of the gel - indentation assay as an approach to evaluate the in vitro metastatic potential of cancer cells ; to validate the approach would require further experimentation with cell lines and primary cells . The gel - assay is more rapid , simple , quantifiable , and provides the evaluation of mechanical invasiveness on single cell level , while also providing an average measure of the invasive subpopulations . By combining both methods we shows a subpopulation of cells , within the evaluated breast - cancer cell lines , which is both mechanically invasive ( gels ) and highly migratory ( Boyden chamber ) . The Boyden chamber migration assay is typically used to identify the migratory capability and invasiveness of cells , and thus determine their metastatic potential . Boyden chambers may be used in different ways , were changing the pore size or the biochemical functionalization of the membrane allows different features of the migration / invasion to be studies ; the equivalent approach in the gel - assay would be to vary gel stiffness ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Massalha and Weihs 2016 ) , its dimensionality or the surface functionalization . Additionally by combining with time lapse imagining , both the gels and the Boyden chamber can be used to characterize cell dynamics . We show by combining the approaches , that passage through a Boyden chamber ( 8  m pores ) concentrates the cells that are able to indent and deform the impenetrable , synthetic , elastic polyacrylamide gel ; the fraction of indenting cells significantly increases in cells that have traversed the Boyden chamber . That is , the ability of the mechanically competent cell - subpopulation to successfully trespass through a Boyden chamber is directly correlated with their propensity to apply force and indent the gel , making both methods comparable . Hence , we propose that the mechanobiology gel - assay and Boyden chamber assay provide complementary information on cell invasiveness , yet the gel - assay has several advantages , such as rapidity and simplicity , as discussed below . We have observed that serum starvation does not affect the indenting cell subpopulation ( i . e . in quantities and attained depths ) , while it is required to induce cell invasion through the Boyden chamber . The interaction of the serum - starved cells with the Boyden chamber membrane may in fact “activate” some of the cells , making them even more invasive . Specifically , a subset of the subpopulation of indenting cells that had been seeded on the Boyden chamber membrane for 72 hours were able to indent the gels more deeply than the control , in both the trespassing and non - trespassing subpopulations ; this shows that cells that do not cross the Boyden chamber may still have the capacity . Serum - starvation has previously been shown to increase the invasiveness of the MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells used here , resulting in larger percentages cells migrating through a Boyden chamber ( Nagelkerke et al . 2013 ; Ye et al . 2013 ) ; serum starvation is typically applied a day prior to the assay . Thus , the serum starvation itself is likely affecting the cell invasiveness . We note that the experiments run with the gel - indentation assay do not require serum starvation and results are unaffected by it . More importantly , the gel - indentation assay provides rapid results ( 1 - 2 hours ) and shows the distribution of single - cell behaviors within a cell population . The mechanically invasive subpopulation that is highlighted here is likely comprised of cells that are capable of performing amoeboid migration . Boyden chamber membranes are non - degradable with sub - cell diameter pores ( here 8 µm pores and cells ~ 20 µm diameter ) , which requires amoeboid migration , including significant cell pliability and dynamic changes in cell morphology . Single , MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells are softer both externally and internally , as compared to non - metastatic cancer and benign breast cells ( Guck et al . 2005 ; Cross et al . 2007 ; Gal and Weihs 2012 ) , due to heightened cytoskeleton dynamics and more sparse intracellular structure ( Mierke et al . 2010 ; Goldstein et al . 2013 ) . Concurrently , the same metastatic cells are also adaptable , and can modify their cytoskeleton and morphology ( Dvir et al . 2015 ) , and apply strong mechanically invasive forces to their microenvironment ( Mierke et al . 2008 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ; Kristal - Muscal et al . 2015 ) . Most of the indenting cells ( ~ 85 % ) in the current work exhibited transient bleb - like membrane protrusions a characteristic of amoeboid migration ( Krakhmal et al . 2015 ) , as also observed previously at our lab ( Kristal - Muscal et al . 2013 ) ; the gels are also non - degradable , making them a non - proteolytic assay similar to Boyden chambers . Cells use such membrane - blebs to actively sense suitable adhesion sites or tracks to successfully invade ( Krakhmal et al . 2015 ) . In summary , our mechanobiology gel - assay approach may be in combination with the Boyden chamber assay to evaluate different aspects of in vitro mechanical invasiveness and metastatic potential of cancer cells . The combined testing approach used here , merging mechanobiology with Boyden chamber migration assays , has revealed a mechanically aggressive subpopulation , being highly migratory and indenting deeply it is likely the metastatic competent subpopulation within these cell lines . The ability to understand and predict cell responses and behavior in different microenvironments is of fundamental importance in tissue engineering , for the design of biologically relevant tissues and scaffolds . Cell motility plays an important role in tissue engineering and in the current work , we highlight a specific aspect of interest that can affect tissue engineered scaffolds , i . e . the mechanical invasiveness exhibited by highly migratory / invasive metastatic cells . The correlation between migration and mechanical invasiveness in cancer cells is highlighted in this work . The gel - indentation mechanobiology approach reveals complementary aspects of cell invasiveness in vitro to those available using the Boyden chamber assay . An advantage of the gel - indentation assay is that it is more rapid ( 1 - 2 hours vs . 3 - 4 days ) and provides quantitative information on single cells in the population , a strength of the mechanobiology approach . The gel - assay may be used independently to determine mechanical aspects of the cell invasiveness , e . g . their “strength” . Furthermore , the approach can be used to evaluate the effect and efficacy of anti - metastatic drugs and also to identify the underlying biochemical and epigenetics associated with the mechanically invasive phenotype , focusing on single cells within the population . There are likely to be several different phenotypes within the indenting cell population ; genetically different subpopulations of breast - cancer cells that promote collective invasion has been observed in 3D spheroids ( Westcott et al . 2015 ) . The isolation and identification of metastatically competent cell subpopulations is essential to understand the underlying causes for metastasis , and to provide accurate prognosis . Thus , using a rapid , quantitative mechanobiology approach could shed light on the nature and abilities of aggressive subpopulations within a tumor sample .

The experimental flow used to evaluate the mechanical , metastatic competence or metastatic potential of the breast cancer cell lines . Cells are serum starved for 24 hrs , seeded on Boyden chambers , and collected after 72 hrs from the top ( no - trespass , black fill ) and bottom ( trespassing , light fill ) . Cells from top and bottom were counted using flow cytometry and their mechanobiology was evaluated on our gel - based system . Results from the Boyden chamber - separated populations were compared to the entire cell - population , both serum full and serum starved . Figure 2 . Single , metastatic , breast cancer cells ( MDA - MB - 231 ) seeded on 2 . 4 kPa stiffness polyacrylamide gel either ( top row ) indent the gels ( bottom row ) adhere but do not indent . ( a - b ) DIC image of indenting and non - indenting cells , showing that both maintain a rounded morphology ; ( c - d ) fluorescence image of 200nm diameter fluorescent beads embedded at the gel surface . In ( c ) beads directly under the cell are displaced to a lower plane due to cell - induced indentation ; ( e ) beads are in focus at 6 . 28 µm below gel surface , indicating the indentation depth generated in the gel ; ( f ) for the non - indenting cell the gel remains flat , and beads are out of focus below the gel surface . Scale bar is 10 µ m . Figure 3 . Percentage of MDA - MB - 468 ( light gray ) and MDA - MB - 231 ( dark gray ) metastatic potential cells that indent the 2 . 4 kPa polyacrylamide gels . Controls include all cells plated on the gels under either serum - full or serum - starved conditions ; control cells were dissociated with trypsin . We compare the whole - population controls to two cell populations that are plated on the gels following Boyden chamber migration for 72 hours being , respectively , the trespassing subpopulation ( collected from the lower chamber ) and the non - trespassing ( NT ) subpopulation ( upper chamber ) ; the experiment is performed once with trypsin and once with a non - enzymatic cell dissociation solution ( CDS ) . Results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation . Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Figure 4 . Indentation depth distributions of MDA - MB - 468 ( a - d , light gray , left ) and MDA - MB - 231 ( e - h , dark gray , right ) breast cancer cells . We compare cells that ( a , e ) trespassed through an 8 µm Boyden chamber ; ( b , f ) non - trespassing cells collected from the top of the Boyden chamber membrane ; ( c , g ) serum - starved controls including all cells ; and ( d , h ) serum - full control with all cells . Dashed lines are guides to the eye noting the maximal observed indentation depths of the controls in both cell types , at least 50 - 100 single cells were evaluated in each condition . Supplementary Materials Figure S1 . Cell viability following Boyden chamber assay . Whole population of unstained ( a ) MDA - MB - 231 and ( d ) MDA - MB - 468 cells are used as control histograms for gating . Insets are forward scatter ( FSC ) vs . side scatter ( SSC ) dot plots with gating on live cells . Cells were collected following Boyden chamber assay and were stained with propidium iodide as a marker for dead cells . MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 468 cells were collected from the upper chamber are ( b ) 98 % and ( e ) 95 % viable , respectively , and from the lower chamber are ( c ) 96 % and ( f ) 96 % viable .
