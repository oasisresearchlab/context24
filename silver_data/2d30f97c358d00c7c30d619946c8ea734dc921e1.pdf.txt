Learning and Instruction 14 ( 2004 ) 445 – 451 www . elsevier . com / locate / learninstruc Editorial Extending the conceptual change approach to mathematics learning and teaching The ﬁve papers that comprise this special issue entitled ‘‘The conceptual change approach to mathematics learning and teaching , ’’ attempt to demonstrate that the conceptual change approach can be a fruitful component of a theory of mathemat - ical learning and instruction . Some of them focus on issues of learning i . e . , on pre - senting evidence that the conceptual change approach provides a powerful explanatory framework for explaining students’ diﬃculties with certain mathemat - ical concepts , while others deal mainly with issues of instruction . In this very brief introduction we will try to deﬁne the conceptual change approach as we see it and outline some of the advantages gained by applying it to mathematics . 1 . Deﬁnitional issues The term ‘‘conceptual change’’ is used to characterize the kind of learning required when the new information to be learned comes in conﬂict with the learners’ prior knowledge usually acquired on the basis of everyday experiences . It is claimed that in these situations , a major reorganization of prior knowledge is required—a conceptual change . Some of the situations where conceptual change is required involve , for example , the acquisition of the scientiﬁc concept of force which comes in conﬂict with the everyday concept of force as a property of physical objects ( Chi , Slotta , & de Leeuw , 1994 ) , understanding the Copernican view of the solar sys - tem which comes in conﬂict with the geocentric view ( Vosniadou & Brewer , 1994 ) , and the acquisition of the concept of fraction as it requires radical changes in the pre - existing concept of natural number ( Hartnett & Gelman , 1998 ; Stafylidou & Vosniadou , 2004 ) . Some researchers in learning and instruction ( e . g . , Caravita & Halden , 1994 ) ask : Why should we call this type of learning ‘‘conceptual change’’ and not just ‘‘learning’’ ? While conceptual change is undeniably a form of learning , it is impor - tant to diﬀerentiate conceptual change from other kinds of learning because it requires diﬀerent mechanisms to be accomplished and diﬀerent instructional inter - ventions to be taught . Most learning is additive and involves an enrichment of existing knowledge . Conceptual change cannot , however , be achieved through additive mechanisms . In fact , as we will argue in greater detail later , the use of 0959 - 4752 / $ - see front matter # 2004 Elsevier Ltd . All rights reserved . doi : 10 . 1016 / j . learninstruc . 2004 . 06 . 014 additive mechanisms in situations requiring conceptual change is one of the major causes of misconceptions . A common type of misconception is caused when the new information is added to the incompatible knowledge base , producing synthetic models , like ‘‘the hollow sphere’’ ( Vosniadou & Brewer , 1992 ) , or the belief that fractions are always smaller than the unit ( Stafylidou & Vosniadou , 2004 ) . It is important in instruction to dis - tinguish cases requiring conceptual change and alert students against the use of additive mechanisms in these cases . More generally , it is important to develop intentional learners that have acquired the metacognitive skills to correctly identify diﬀerent kinds of learning and apply the most eﬀective strategies in dealing with them ( Vosniadou , 2003 ) . 2 . Diﬀerent approaches to conceptual change The conceptual change approach was brought to the ﬁeld of learning and instruction from the philosophy and history of science ( Kuhn , 1970 ; Lakatos , 1970 ) by science educators who saw certain analogies between theory changes in the history of science and students’ learning of science ( e . g . , Posner , Strike , Hewson , & Gertzog , 1982 ) . Since the 1970s researchers such as Viennot ( 1979 ) , Novak ( 1977 ) and Driver and Easley ( 1978 ) realized that students bring to the science learning task alternative frameworks or misconceptions that are robust and diﬃcult to extinguish . Posner et al . ( 1982 ) and also McCloskey ( 1983 ) saw these alternative frameworks as theories that need to be replaced by the currently accepted , correct scientiﬁc views through a process of conceptual change . Drawing on Kuhn ( 1970 ) , Posner et al . ( 1982 ) argued that in order for students to be able to replace their alternative conceptual frameworks with the currently accepted scien - tiﬁc views : ( a ) there must be dissatisfaction with existing conceptions , ( b ) the new conception must be intelligible , ( c ) the new conception must appear initially plaus - ible , and ( d ) the new concept should suggest the possibility of a fruitful program . The Posner et al . ( 1982 ) theoretical framework became the leading paradigm that guided research and instructional practices in science education , until it became subject to several criticisms ( i . e . , Caravita & Halden , 1994 ; Smith , diSessa , & Roschelle , 1993 ) . These critics pointed out that the conceptual change approach focuses on the mistaken qualities of students’ prior knowledge and ignores their productive ideas , that alternative conceptions may be not as robust as they seem to be , that cognitive conﬂict is not an eﬀective instructional strategy , and that instruc - tion that ‘‘confronts misconceptions with a view to replacing them is misguided and unlikely to succeed’’ ( Smith et al . , p . 153 ) . Caravita and Halden ( 1994 ) also pointed out that conceptual change happens in a larger situational , educational , and socio / cultural context , that it is aﬀected by motivational and aﬀective vari - ables , and that we need to recognize that science is socially constructed and vali - dated ( see also Driver , Asoko , Leach & Mortiner , 1994 ; Pintrich , 1999 ) . We agree with all of the above - mentioned criticisms of the original conceptual change approach . Most important , we ﬁnd a great deal of truth in the recommen - Editorial / Learning and Instruction 14 ( 2004 ) 445 – 451 446 dation to study the knowledge acquisition process in greater detail , and in parti - cular , the need to focus on ‘‘detailed descriptions of the evolution of knowledge systems’’ ( Smith et al . , 1993 : p . 154 ) over long periods of time . Indeed , research in cognitive development provides an important source of information about the pro - cesses of conceptual change ( e . g . , Carey , 1985 ; Gallistel & Gelman , 1992 ; Hatano & Inagaki , 1998 ) . More speciﬁcally , Vosniadou and her colleagues have attempted to provide a cognitive developmental approach to conceptual change through detailed descriptions of the development of knowledge in several areas of the natu - ral sciences , such as observational astronomy ( Vosniadou , 1994 , 2003 ; Vosniadou & Brewer , 1992 , 1994 ) mechanics ( Ioannides & Vosniadou , 2001 ; Megalakaki , Ioannides , Vosniadou , & Tiberghien , 1997 ) , geophysics ( Ioannidou & Vosniadou , 2001 ) , chemistry ( Kouka , Vosniadou , & Tsaparlis , 2001 ) , and biology ( Kyrkos & Vosniadou , 1997 ) . The results of these studies have shown that young children answer questions about force , matter , the earth in space , or about the composition of earth , mostly in an internally consistent way , revealing the existence of narrow but coherent initial explanatory frameworks . These explanatory frameworks are diﬀerent in their structure , in the phenomena they explain , and in their individual concepts , from the scientiﬁc theories to which children are exposed through systematic instruction . The process of learning science is a slow and gradual one , during which children usually add the new , scientiﬁc , information to their initial explanatory frameworks , destroying their coherence and creating synthetic models . Examples of such syn - thetic models are the model of the dual sphere , the hollow sphere , or the ﬂattened sphere , the model of the sun and the moon revolving around a spherical earth in a geocentric solar system , etc . ( see Vosniadou & Brewer , 1992 , 1994 ) . One could argue that the cognitive developmental approach to conceptual change is not very diﬀerent from the classical conceptual change approach put for - ward by Posner et al . ( 1982 ) . But this is not the case . The cognitive developmental approach to conceptual change meets all the criticisms of Smith et al . ( 1993 ) . First , misconceptions are not considered as unitary , faulty conceptions that represent a diﬀerent physical theory . Rather , we describe a knowledge system consisting of many diﬀerent elements organized in complex ways . Second , we make a distinction between the learner’s initial explanatory framework , prior to systematic instruc - tion , and misconceptions that are produced after instruction . We believe that most of these misconceptions can be characterized as synthetic models—i . e . , attempts by learners to synthesize the new information with the initial explanatory framework . Third , our theoretical position is a constructivist one . Not only it assumes that new information is built on existing knowledge structures ; it also uses constructivism to explain students’ misconceptions and to provide a comprehensive framework for making meaningful and detailed predictions about the knowledge acquisition pro - cess . Finally , while our cognitive approach investigates only one facet of concep - tual change , it is complementary and not contradictory to other approaches that deal with motivational / aﬀective and socio / cultural factors ( Anderson , Greeno , Reder , & Simon , 2000 ) . 447 Editorial / Learning and Instruction 14 ( 2004 ) 445 – 451 3 . Conceptual change and mathematics learning Although some historians of mathematics ﬁnd the Kuhnian conceptual change approach particularly fruitful in the case of mathematics ( e . g . , Corry , 1993 ; Dauben , 1984 ; Kitcher , 1992 ) , there is a general reluctance in philosophy and history of science circles to apply the conceptual change approach to mathematics . That mathematics is based on deductive proof and not on experiment , that is pro - ven to be extremely tolerant of anomalies , and it does not display the radical incommensurability of theory before and after revolution , are some of the reasons why Thomas Kuhn himself exempted mathematics from the pattern of scientiﬁc development and change presented in the Scientiﬁc Revolutions ( see Mahoney , 1997 ) . According to Mahoney ( 1997 : p . 2 ) ‘‘synthetic geometry , invariant theory , or quaternions may lose interest for mathematicians , subjects may be judged obsol - escent or fruitless , but they do not seem to cease to be mathematics in the way that Aristotle’s mechanics ceased to be mechanics , or Galen’s physiology ceased to be physiology , or phlogistron chemistry ceased to be chemistry’’ 1 . Unlike science , the formulation of a new theory in mathematics usually carries mathematics to a more general level of analysis and enables a wider perspective that makes possible solu - tions that have been impossible to formulate before ( Corry , 1993 ; Dauben , 1984 ) . Similar diﬀerences between the natural sciences and mathematics are also noted by some of the authors in the present issue . We ﬁnd this discussion particularly interesting because it helps to illuminate some of the debates that have taken place in the conceptual change approach literature as it applies to learning situations . More speciﬁcally , a number of researchers have pointed out that even in the case of the natural sciences concep - tual change should not be seen in terms of the replacement of students’ naı¨ve phys - ics with the ‘‘correct’’ scientiﬁc theory but in terms of enabling students to develop multiple perspectives and / or more abstract explanatory frameworks with greater generality and power ( Driver et al . , 1994 ; Spada , 1994 ) . It thus appears that the theory replacement issue ( which represents a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the historical development of the natural sciences compared to mathematics ) may not be an issue in the case of learning and instruction . In fact , students are confronted with similar situations when they learn math - ematics and science . As it is the case that students develop a naı¨ve physics on the basis of everyday experience , they also develop a ‘‘naı¨ve mathematics’’ , which appears to be neurologically based ( developed through a long process of evol - ution ) , and that consists of certain core principles or presuppositions ( such as the presupposition of discreteness in the number concept ) that facilitate some kinds of learning but inhibit others ( Dehaene , 1998 ; Gelman , 2000 ; Lipton & Spelke , 2003 ) . 1 The common explanation of this diﬀerence is that ‘‘mathematicians deal with worlds of their own making , which their encounters with the physical world cannot constrain them to change’’ ( Mahoney , 1997 : p . 2 ) . Editorial / Learning and Instruction 14 ( 2004 ) 445 – 451 448 Such similarities support the argument that the conceptual change approach can be fruitfully applied in the case of learning mathematics . 4 . What do we gain from a conceptual change approach in mathematics learning and teaching ? We are not the ﬁrst to argue that there may be discordances and conﬂicts between many advanced mathematical concepts and ‘‘naı ¨ ve mathematics . ’’ Fisch - bein ( 1987 ) was one of the ﬁrst mathematical educators to notice that intuitive beliefs may be the cause of students’ systematic errors in mathematics , a fact also noted by Stavy and Tirosh ( 2000 ) in their intuitive rules theory ( see also Tirosh & Tsamir , this issue ) , by researchers such as Greeno ( 1991 ) , and Verschaﬀel and De Corte ( 1993 ) in the case of addition and subtraction , and pointed out by many other math educators such as Vergnaud ( 1989 ) and Sfard ( 1987 ) . Other researchers have argued that incompatibility between prior knowledge and incoming infor - mation may be the source of students’ diﬃculties in understanding algebra ( Kieran , 1992 ) , fractions ( Hartnett & Gelman , 1998 ) , rational numbers ( Merenluoto & Lehtinen , 2002 ) , etc . The conceptual change approach has the potential to enrich a social constructivist perspective and provides the needed framework to systematize the above - mentioned widespread ﬁndings and utilize them for a theory of math - ematics learning and instruction . Some of the more obvious advantages of exploring the instructional implications of the conceptual change approach are the following : It can be used as a guide to identify concepts in mathematics that are going to cause students great diﬃculty , to predict and explain students’ systematic errors and misconceptions , to provide student - centered explanations of counter - intuitive math concepts , to alert students against the use of additive mechanisms in these cases , to ﬁnd the appropriate bridging analogies , etc . In a more general fashion , and as it is being discussed by the individual contributions to this volume , it highlights the importance of devel - oping students who are intentional learners and have developed the metacognitive skills required to overcome the barriers imposed by their prior knowledge ( Schoen - feld , 1987 ; Vosniadou , 2003 ) .
