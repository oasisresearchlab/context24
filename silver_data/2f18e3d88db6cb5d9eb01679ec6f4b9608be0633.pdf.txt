Drubin 1 , Eva Nogales 1 , 2 , 3 & Georjana Barnes 1 Chromosomes interact through their kinetochores with micro - tubule plus ends and they are segregated to the spindle poles as the kinetochore microtubules shorten during anaphase A of mitosis . The molecular natures and identities of coupling proteins that allow microtubule depolymerization to pull chromosomes to poles during anaphase have long remained elusive 1 . In budding yeast , the ten - protein Dam1 complex is a critical microtubule - binding component of the kinetochore 2 that oligomerizes into a 50 - nm ring around a microtubule in vitro 3 , 4 . Here we show , with the use of a real - time , two - colour ﬂuorescence microscopy assay , that the ring complex moves processively for several micrometres at the ends of depolymerizing microtubules without detaching from the lattice . Electron microscopic analysis of ‘end - on views’ revealed a 16 - fold symmetry of the kinetochore rings . This out - of - register arrangement with respect to the 13 - fold microtubule symmetry is consistent with a sliding mechanism based on an electrostatically coupled ring – microtubule interface . The Dam1 ring complex is a molecular device that can translate the force generated by microtubule depolymerization into movement along the lattice to facilitate chromosome segregation . Although in principle minus - end - directed motor proteins could be responsible for the poleward transport of chromosomes , it has long been recognized that the force generated by microtubule depolymerization itself contributes to movements during anaphase A 1 , 5 . Microtubule depolymerization is sufﬁcient to move metazoan chromosomes 6 or kinesin - coated microbeads in vitro 7 , 8 . Different theoretical models have tried to explain how kinetochores exploit the force created by depolymerization 9 , 10 , but the molecular nature of a device that would remain attached to a disassembling microtubule end without losing its connection has remained elusive . Budding yeast mitosis displays anaphase A and B movements 11 , and kinetochore microtubule dynamics are restricted to plus ends 12 . Recent studies have revealed that the budding yeast kinetochore is composed of at least eight multiprotein complexes that assemble on centromeric DNA in a hierarchical manner 13 – 15 . A critical micro - tubule binding activity of the kinetochore is provided by the ten - protein Dam1 complex , which is essential for mitotic spindle integrity and , under regulation by the yeast Aurora B kinase Ipl1p , for the establishment and maintenance of bipolar chromosome attachments 16 – 18 . Puriﬁed Dam1 complex oligomerizes into 50 - nm ring structures when incubated with microtubules in vitro 3 , 4 . The Dam1 rings form at physiologically relevant concentrations , encircle the microtubule orthogonal to its axis , promote microtubule assembly , and prefer - entially bind to the GTP lattice of GTP / GDP - segmented microtu - bules , suggesting a mechanism for their targeting to plus ends 3 . Two observations suggested that the ring complex might exhibit lateral mobility on the microtubule : ﬁrst , the nature of the interaction between rings and microtubules is largely electrostatic , and second , electron micrographs of the Dam1 ring complex showed that rings accumulated at the ends of depolymerizing microtubules 3 . To uncover the principles of force generation and motility at the kinetochore we sought to develop a ﬂuorescence microscopy assay that would allow observation of the Dam1 complex on dynamic microtubules in real time . The main challenge was to observe microtubules that are not completely attached to the surface of a ﬂow cell because this might impede movement of the ring complex . This was achieved by imaging the microtubules in a ﬂow chamber ﬁlled with a viscous solution of methylcellulose and by blocking the glass surfaces to limit non - speciﬁc adsorption 19 ( Fig . 1a ) . To mimic microtubule dynamics during anaphase we induced depolymeriza - tion either by including the kinesin13 family member XMCAK1 in the motility buffer or by diluting Dam1 - decorated microtubules below the critical concentration for microtubule assembly . Indis - tinguishable results were obtained by both disassembly protocols . When 5 nM Alexa488 - conjugated Dam1 complex was incubated with rhodamine - labelled microtubules , which were then diluted , microtubules depolymerized over the course of several minutes . As the free end of the microtubule shortened , the Alexa488 signal could clearly be seen tracking with the disassembling end ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Movie S1 ) . In cases where the observed microtubule was completely free in solution , Dam1 signals tracked both depoly - merizing ends and increased in intensity as the microtubule shor - tened ( Supplementary Movie S2 ) . In rare events , the Dam1 signal was partly released from the depolymerizing end , probably as a result of adsorption of the complex to the coverslip surface . In these cases , the green ﬂuorescent Dam1 signal was ‘stretched’ before release , demon - strating the force generated by the depolymerizing microtubule end ( Supplementary Movie S3 ) . In principle , tracking could occur through one of two different mechanisms : continued association of an intact ring with the microtubule lattice ( ‘sliding’ ) , or the rapid dissociation and reassoci - ation of ring subunits with the retracting microtubule end ( ‘turn - over’ ) . To distinguish between these possibilities , we mixed green ﬂuorescent Alexa488 – Dam1 complex with red ﬂuorescent Alexa594 – Dam1 complex and incubated this mixture with unlabelled micro - tubules ; after incubation for 30 min we visualized them in our assay system . Because rings were formed by randomly combining green and red ﬂuorescent complexes , each spot on the microtubule showed a strict co - localization of green and red signals ( Fig . 1c ) . In the next experiment , we added green and then red ﬂuorescent Dam1 complex sequentially to microtubules . If the rings turned over , one would expect the subunits to re - equilibrate such that the spots on the microtubules would be green and red as in Fig . 1c . However , in this LETTERS 1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , 2 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , 3 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , University of California Berkeley , Berkeley , California 94720 - 3202 , USA . Vol 440 | 23 March 2006 | doi : 10 . 1038 / nature04409 565 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group experiment most spots on the microtubule were either red or green ( Fig . 1d ) . The rare cases in which red and green signals seemed to co - localize probably arose from adjacent rings on the microtubule too close to be resolved by ﬂuorescence microscopy . We conclude that under our assay conditions , once bound to the microtubule , the ring subunits do not turn over and the ring tracks with the depolymeriz - ing microtubule end as an intact entity . We next tested whether the ring complex can couple microtubule depolymerization to the movement of a cargo . We prepared modiﬁed Dam1 rings by combining green ﬂuorescent complexes with bioti - nylated complexes . These Dam1 rings readily recruited streptavidin - coated , red ﬂuorescent microbeads to microtubules ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . After the induction of depolymerization , the beads remained attached to Dam1 - decorated depolymerizing microtubule ends and were translocated in the direction of depolymerization ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Movie S4 ) . This result shows that the ring complex can act as a coupling device under load to move objects with the depolymerizing microtubule end . Next we investigated the behaviour of multiple well - spaced Dam1 ring complexes on depolymerizing microtubule ends . As the micro - tubule disassembled , the distal Dam1 signal tracked with the end and merged with the next signal ; both continued to move together with increased ﬂuorescence intensity ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . This ‘collection’ of Dam1 signals is further illustrated by a kymograph representation ( Fig . 2b ) , which shows oblique Dam1 lines that merge and increase in intensity as a function of time . We quantiﬁed the Alexa488 signal of the depolymerizing end and found that it increased in steps of approximately equal magnitude .

LETTERS NATURE | Vol 440 | 23 March 2006 566 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group contrast , the intensity of the tubulin signal of the depolymerizing end remained constant over time ( Fig . 2c ) . In many cases the collection of multiple Dam1 signals seemed to slow down or eventually stall depolymerization ( Fig . 2b ) . For a better evaluation of the effect of Dam1 ring concentration on depolymerization rates we observed microtubules with asymmetrically distributed Dam1 rings : as shown in Fig . 2d ( Supplementary Movie S6 ) , a sparsely decorated end ( green arrowhead ) depolymerized over time and the Dam1 signal tracked with the end as observed previously . In contrast , the other end ( white arrowhead ) initially started to depolymerize ( 0 – 60 s ) but then stalled at an area with a high Dam1 concentration ( 60 – 280 s ) . Thus , direct observation indicates that two fundamental biochemical activities of the complex , namely stabilization and mobility along the lattice , depend on the relative concentration of Dam1 rings at the micro - tubule ends . We next investigated the dynamics of individual Dam1 rings on stable microtubules . Alexa488 – Dam1 complex was incubated at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 – 5 nM with Taxol - stabilized microtubules and followed by using ﬂuorescence microscopy at high time resol - ution to detect small movements . On observation of the whole ﬁeld , numerous Dam1 spots could be seen undergoing small random motions without directional preference ( Supplementary Movie S7 ) . On single Taxol - stabilized microtubules individual Dam1 spots moved independently of each other , changed direction , merged , and separated again ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Movie S8 ) . In contrast , Dam1 signals that were adsorbed on the coverslip surface remained immobile ( Supplementary Movie S9 ) . Thus , individual Dam1 rings show undirected , one - dimensional diffusion on a stable microtubule lattice . The mean - square displacement of individual spots increased linearly as a function of time ( Fig . 3b ) . From the slope of the graph we calculated an average diffusion constant of about 0 . 54 £ 10 2 9 cm 2 s 2 1 for the movement , which is comparable to values reported for other microtubule – motor - protein systems 7 , 20 . The sliding of a ring complex along the lattice is a previously unobserved mode of microtubule - based motility and we sought to investigate structural determinants for such a mechanism . When we saturated Taxol - stabilized microtubules with Dam1 complex and revealed the sample by negative - stain electron microscopy , we occasionally observed ‘end - on views’ that provided axial projections of the microtubule – Dam1 complex arrangement ( Fig . 4a ) . In the best three images the number of protoﬁlaments ( 13 ) could clearly be counted , but the individual Dam1 complexes in the ring density around the microtubule were not as well deﬁned . We performed rotational analysis on three end - on images after masking out the Figure3 | One - dimensional diffusionof Dam1ringsonstablemicrotubules . a , An individual Dam1 spot on a Taxol - stabilized microtubule is followed over time .

The free energy of GTP hydrolysis is released as peeling protoﬁlaments produce a power - stroke by means of a transition from straight to curved .

NATURE | Vol 440 | 23 March 2006 LETTERS 567 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group microtubule density . This analysis revealed a consistent 16 - fold symmetry for the Dam1 ring . The sharpness of different rotational averages of the ring density at and around the correct rotational symmetry supports the cross - correlation analysis and provides a signal - enhanced view of the arrangement of the 16 Dam1 complexes as they form a ring around the microtubule ( Fig . 4b ) . The symmetry mismatch between the 13 - fold microtubule and the 16 - fold Dam1 ring suggests that there might not be speciﬁc inter - actions between the surface of the microtubule and the Dam1 ring . Other combinations of microtubules ( 14 protoﬁlament microtubules assembled with guanosine - 5 0 - [ ( a , b ) - methyleno ] triphosphate ( GMPCPP ) ) and Dam1 rings ( 18 - foldfor instance ) were alsoobserved with symmetry mismatch . These observations , and the requirement of the tubulin C termini for the interaction with and assembly of the Dam1 rings , are consistent with a sliding mechanism in which positive charges in the inner surface of the Dam1 ring interact electrostatically with the negative charges along the microtubule surface 3 . Thus , we have obtained conclusive evidence that the Dam1 ring complex , a critical microtubule - binding element of the budding yeast kinetochore , diffuses along the microtubule lattice and moves processively with the end of a depolymerizing microtubule . This processive movement could help chromosomes to stay attached to disassembling kinetochore microtubules during anaphase A and contribute to the successful segregation of chromosomes in the absence of minus - end - directed motors . Typically , microtubules have been viewed as static tracks along which motor proteins transport cargo . However , microtubules themselves produce pushing and pulling forces that can move cellular structures 21 . Our analysis of Dam1 motility shows that the microtubule end and the ring complex form a molecular machine that generates movement ( Fig . 4c ) . Because the GTP and GDP forms of microtubule protoﬁlaments differ in their preferred conformations 22 , 23 , the chemical energy of GTP hydrolysis is stored as mechanical strain in the lattice and is released as a power - stroke by the outward peeling of protoﬁla - ments 24 – 26 . The ring is needed as a force - coupling device that translates the mechanical energy of the power - stroke into a sustained movement along the lattice . As the ring moves in response to the polymerization state of the microtubule end , we also note that it could be part of the tension - sensing machinery that monitors kinetochore – microtubule attachments 27 . Despite its remarkable properties in vitro , the Dam1 complex is clearly not the only factor that contributes to dynamic kinetochore attachment at microtubule ends in vivo . Some chromosome segre - gation occurs in dam1 mutants at the restrictive temperature , and the ﬁssion yeast Dam1 complex , although also contributing to high - ﬁdelity chromosome segregation , is not essential for viability 28 , 29 . The Dam1 complex could be especially important in budding yeast because only one microtubule attaches to each kinetochore . METHODS In vitro assays . Alexa488 - labelled or 594 - labelled Dam1 complex was prepared as described , and electron microscopy showed regular ring formation of the complex 3 . In an analogous procedure , biotin - maleimide ( Sigma ) was coupled to Dam1 complex and free biotin was separated by gel ﬁltration . Flow cells were constructedwithtwolayersofdouble - sidedtapeand12mm £ 12mmcoverslips tocreateachambervolumeofabout15 m l . Toblocksurfacestheywerepretreated with 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) Pluronic F108 ( BASF ) in PEM medium ( 80mM PIPES / KOH pH6 . 8 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA ) . Motility reactions ( 20 m l ) contained 0 . 8 % ( w / v ) methylcellulose ( Sigma ) , 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) Pluronic F108 , 200 m gml 2 1 glucose oxidase , 35 m gml 2 1 catalase , 4 . 5mgml 2 1 glucose , 0 . 5 % 2 - mercaptoethanol , 1mgml 2 1 BSA and 0 . 5mgml 2 1 casein in PEM and the indicated amounts of Alexa488 – Dam1 complex and microtubules . To follow XMCAK1 - catalysed depolymerization , 1 m l of rhodamine - labelled GMPCPP microtubules ( 15 m M ) wasincubatedwith1 m l ofAlexa488 – Dam1complex ( 0 . 4 m M ) for5minat37 8 C . Then 1 m l of the mixture was combined with 19 m l of motility buffer containing 15nM XMCAK1 and 1 . 5mM MgATP . Alternatively , 30 m M microtubules were assembledinthe presence of 1mM GTPand25 % ( v / v ) glycerol , and 1 m l ofthese microtubules was then incubated with 1 m l of Alexa488 – Dam1 complex and the samplewas diluted1 : 10into motility buffercontaining 8 m Munlabelledtubulin . The sample was introduced into the ﬂow cell and observed immediately at 25 8 C onaninvertedOlympus IX81epi - illuminatedmicroscope with a100 £ objective ( numerical aperture 1 . 4 ) and neutral - density ﬁlters . For the observation of processive movements on depolymerizing microtubule ends , two - channel movies were made with a green ﬂuorescent protein / red ﬂuorescent protein ﬁlter set and motorized excitation and emission ﬁlter - wheels . The camera and the ﬁlter - wheels were controlled by Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging ) . General processing of movies and images was performed with the ImageJ software ( rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Electron microscopy and symmetry analysis . Microtubule – Dam1 complexes were revealed by electron microscopy of negatively stained samples . Dam1 complex ( 20 m l , 30 m M ) was incubated with 20 m l of Taxol - stabilized micro - tubules ( 3 . 75 m M ) for 15min at 37 8 C , pelleted at 139 , 000 g in a TL100 rotor and resuspended in 40 m l of PEM ( containing 1mM GTP and 10 m M Taxol ) . The sample was stained with uranyl acetate and electron microscopic images were recorded as described previously 3 . The rotational symmetry of the Dam1 complexes around the microtubules as seen in end - on views was analysed with the SPIDER image processing package 30 . The end - on microtubule – Dam1 ring image was translated so that its rotation centre coincided with the image centre . The microtubule density was masked so that only the outer density correspondingtotheDam1ringremained . Theringwasthenrotatedatdifferent angles and the cross - correlation coefﬁcients with the original ring were calcu - lated . A maximum in the cross - correlation proﬁle as a function of the rotation angle was found every 22 . 5 8 , corresponding to a 16 - fold rotational symmetry . Different rotational averages of the Dam1 ring density at and around the correct rotational symmetry ( 16 - fold ) were then calculated with SPIDER .
