Recent work has reported a role for extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) , known to transfer various nucleic acids , in uptake of TLR - activating molecules , raising speculation about possible roles of EVs in innate immune surveillance . Whether EV - mediated uptake is a general mechanism , however , was unresolved ; and the molecular machinery that might be involved was unknown . We show that , when macrophages are stimulated with the TLR9 agonist CpG oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODN ) , the secreted EVs transport ODN into naïve macrophages and induce the release of chemokine TNF - α . In addition , these EVs transfer Cdc42 into recipient cells , resulting in further enhancement of their cellular uptake . Transport of ODN and Cdc42 from TLR9 - activated macrophages to naïve cells via EVs exerts synergetic effects in propagation of the intracellular immune response , suggesting a general mechanism of EV - mediated uptake of pathogen - associated molecular patterns . INTRODUCTION Intracellular innate immunity has attracted intensive research attention , especially with respect to key mediators such as endosomal Toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) , cyclic guanosine 5′ - monophosphate – adenosine 5′ - monophosphate synthase , and stimulator of interferon genes in the cytosolic innate immune sensing DNA and RNA from pathogens ( 1 , 2 ) . Human TLRs are an important family of innate immune receptors located either on the cell surface ( TLR1 , TLR2 , TLR4 , TLR5 , TLR6 , and TLR10 ) or inside cells within the endosomal compartment ( TLR3 , TLR7 , TLR8 , and TLR9 ) , which are capable of recognizing pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) and danger - associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) ( 3 – 5 ) . Intriguingly , a mechanism involving extra - cellular vesicles ( EVs ) derived from bacteria has been recently found in the induction of innate immunity activation by facilitating the up - take of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , a classic PAMP for TLR4 on the cellular surfaces ( 6 , 7 ) . With the assistance of EVs , LPS penetrates the cellular membranes and activates various inflammatory caspases in the cytosol ( 7 ) . Nonetheless , little is known about whether other PAMPs / DAMPs also use similar EV vehicles or what molecular machinery is involved . EVs play pivotal roles in cell - cell communication during different pathological and physiological processes ( 8 ) . The passage of EVs between the donor and recipient cells is an important means of transfer for molecules , including proteins , nucleic acids , and lipids , and these specific molecules could , in turn , have an impact on EV cellular uptake ( 9 , 10 ) . A recent study showed that the metastatic potency of cancerous , EV - donating cells could determine the uptake efficiency of the EV - receiving cells ( 11 ) . This was evidenced by the findings showing that EVs isolated from metastatic site - derived PC - 3 cells were more efficiently internalized into the recipient cells , compared with EVs from primary malignant cells ( 11 ) . EVs secreted from immune cells showed immune - modulatory capacity ( 12 – 14 ) . In immune responses , EVs secreted from macrophages upon infection of bacterial antigens induced the activation of dendritic cells and T cells both in vitro and in vivo ( 14 ) . Although EVs have been implicated in mediating immune responses , the role of EVs in the cellular internalization of different PAMPs and the activation of intracellular innate immunity warrants further investigation . In this study , we investigated whether EVs transported PAMP / DAMP molecules that affect cell functions upon reception of these EVs . Our findings showed that a TLR9 ligand , CpG oligodeoxynucleotides ( ODN ) , was transported by EVs from infected macrophages into naïve macrophages , suggesting roles for EVs in the mediation of both inter - and intracellular innate immu - nity with oligo DNA PAMPs as cargos . At the same time , enhanced cellular uptake of EVs from ODN - infected macrophages was observed , compared with EVs from noninfected cells . Moreover , mechanisti - cally , we showed that EVs transported Cdc42 , a protein responsible for increased cellular endocytic activity into cells . Particularly , ODN carried by EVs induced the release of tumor necrosis factor –  ( TNF -  ) , which further activated Cdc42 to promote the cellular up - take of EVs . Together , these results may point to a general mecha - nism whereby EVs facilitate the entry of different PAMPs / DAMPs into recipient cells . These findings not only shed light on the activa - tion of innate immunity but also suggest a previously unidentified regulation strategy for these important biological pathways . RESULTS EVs transport ODN into endosomes to interact with TLR9 EVs have been shown to be capable of transporting nucleic acids such as DNA , messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , and microRNA ( miRNA ) between cells ( 9 , 15 ) .

Therefore , we hypothesized that EVs may carry ODN from stimulated cells into nonstimulated ones and induce physiological changes in the recipient cells . To test our hypothesis , we added fluorescently labeled fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) – ODN into DsRed - marked and TLR9 - overexpressing cells , and the progress of EVs release from these cells was monitored using live - cell confocal microscopy . We observed that most EVs released from DsRed - marked cells were labeled with red fluorescence . Some of the EVs were visualized with yellow fluorescence due to the colocalization of FITC - ODN and DsRed protein ( Fig . 1A and movie S1 ) . Next , we isolated EVs by the standard ultracentrifugation protocol ( fig . S1A ) and characterized them with a transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) and the Western blot . TEM analysis showed that the diameters of our isolated EVs were approximately 150 nm ( fig . S1B ) . Typical protein markers for EVs such as CD63 , CD9 , and Hsp70 were identified in the Western blot analysis , confirming the identity of those isolated EVs ( fig . S1C ) . The level of β - actin was negligible in EVs compared to that in cells ; therefore , it was used as a negative control in our tests ( 17 ) . Moreover , results from nanoparticle tracking analysis ( NTA ) using a scattering mode further confirmed the presence of particles around the expected size of EVs in the samples ( Fig . 1B ) . We expected that EVs isolated from FITC - ODN – treated cells would be visible with green fluorescence because of their FITC - ODN cargo . Because of their ultramicroscopic sizes , we observed the isolated EVs using structured illumination microscopy ( N - SIM ) , an established method for visualization of nanoparticles with diameters as small as approximately 100 nm . The results showed that these EVs were indeed visualized with fluorescence at green wavelengths , indicating that FITC - labeled ODN was carried by EVs ( Fig . 1C ) . In contrast , we did not observe Fig . 1 . EVs transport ODN into recipient cells . ( A ) EVs released from FITC - ODN – treated DsRed + cells ( marked by arrows ) . DsRed + cells were treated with 0 . 5  M FITC - ODN for 12 hours before real - time monitoring by confocal microscopy for 4 hours .

After 12 hours of the treatment , EVs were isolated from the TLR9 - overexpressing human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293 cell culture medium by ultracentrifugation . Then , the isolated EVs were mounted with a fluoromount aqueous mounting medium onto glass slides and observed by the Nikon N - SIM microscopy system . Scale bar , 1  m .

In addition , results from high - sensitivity flow cytometry analysis of these EVs showed that FITC fluorescence intensity notably in - creased by ~ 20 % in EVs derived from FITC - ODN – treated cells , consistent with our observation from N - SIM microscopy imaging ( fig . S1D ) ( 18 ) . When the isolated FITC - ODN - EVs were added into cells , the colocalization of TLR9 , endosome , and the fluorescent EVs in the recipient cells was observed ( Fig . 1D ) . The ratio for colocalization between FITC - ODN - EVs and TLR9 was 83 . 17 ± 5 . 61 % . Together , these results indicated that the traffic of EVs between cells led to the transport of ODN into the endosome in recipient cells , which interacted with TLR9 . Cellular uptake of EVs increases upon ODN stimulation TLR9 is localized in the endosome in response to the inflammatory activation by ODN ( 19 ) . On the other hand , the endosome is also one of the sources of the EV biogenesis ( 10 ) . To test whether TLR9 activation correlates with EVs , we first investigated the effect of TLR9 activation on the intercellular EV transfer . A previously reported Cre - LoxP reporter system was used here to visualize the amount of EVs in the cell - cell communication ( 20 ) . In this reporter system , Cre mRNA from donor cells is loaded into EVs that can be taken up by recipient cells . Upon entry into the recipient cells by endocytosis , the expressed Cre recombinase induces Cre - LoxP recombination , resulting in the excision of the gene encoding the red fluorescent protein and the switch of fluorescent colors from red to green ( Fig . 2A ) ( 20 ) . The chosen concentrations of ODN were within the range in which TLR9 activation could be observed , determined by an established secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase reporter assay ( Fig . 2B ) ( 21 ) . The results showed that the ODN challenge increased the number of EVs transferred between cells in a dose - dependent manner , either in short distances when cells were mixed and cultured in the same layer ( Fig . 2C ) or in long distances when cells were separated by a 400 - nm filter in a Transwell chamber , which only allowed EVs to pass ( Fig . 2D ) . Using EVs isolated from the donor ( Cre + ) cells to stimulate the recipient ( reporter + ) cells , we observed similar results that the EV transfer increase significantly in the presence of ODN treatment ( fig . S2A ) . In the reporter system , where little TLR9 was expressed , ODN treatment did not significantly increase the transfer of EVs , suggesting that the modulation of EV transfer by ODN was due to the activation of TLR9 ( fig . S2 , B and C ) . In addition , when comparing ODN - stimulated with unstimulated cells , neither the percentage of dead cells nor the growth rate of cells was affected , determined by Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) ( fig . S2D ) ( 22 ) . Next , we set out to determine whether the increase of EV traffic between cells was primarily due to the enhancement of the secretion from donor cells or the uptake by recipient cells . With NTA analysis , we quantified the particles around the size of EVs isolated from the culture media of RAW 264 . 7 cells with or without ODN treatment . The results showed that the number of EVs secreted from cells treated with ODN ( ODN - EV ) was substantially higher than those of the control - EV ( CTL - EV ) released from nontreated cells ( Fig . 2E ) . Next , we investigated the cellular uptake of EVs by adding the same amount of PKH67 - labeled CTL - EV and ODN - EV into RAW 264 . 7 cells . Cell plasma membrane was fluorescently labeled with anti – Glut1 to exclude potential false - positive results caused by nonspecific staining of the membrane by PKH67 , as shown by Takov et al . ( 23 ) . We found that the cellular uptake of ODN - EV was also significantly higher compared with CTL - EV , suggesting that ODN - EV was more prone to be internalized by cells ( Fig . 2F ) . In summary , ODN - induced TLR9 activation had an effect on the intercellular traffic of EVs , in both the secretion from donor cells and the uptake by recipient cells . Cdc42 is enriched in EVs derived from ODN - stimulated cells Emerging data demonstrated that EV protein composition affected their fusion with recipient cells ( 24 , 25 ) . Thus , we focused on probing the underlying mechanism for the increase of the cellular uptake of EVs through an analysis of their protein cargo . Using liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) analysis , we identified 1235 different proteins in EVs isolated from RAW 264 . 7 cell culture supernatant . Among these , in three independent experiments , 42 proteins were found only in ODN - EV and 16 proteins were found only in CTL - EV ( Fig . 3A ) . Moreover , within the proteins identified in both CTL - EV and ODN - EV , 57 proteins significantly increased and five proteins decreased in ODN - EV [ 1 . 5 - fold cutoff was chosen to show biological significance ( 26 ) ] , compared with CTL - EV ( Fig . 3A ) . Further bioinformatics analyses of gene ontology ( GO ) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) were performed on 99 proteins , namely , the combination of the 57 proteins that signifi - cantly increased and the 42 proteins only present in ODN - EV ( fig . S3 , A to D ) . In the KEGG analysis , signaling pathways with P value < 0 . 05 , i . e . , – log ( P value ) > 1 . 3 , were considered enriched . From our analysis , the most enriched signaling pathway was “endocytosis” ( fig . S3A ) . Since our interest lay in the uptake of EVs into cells , we next investigated those proteins involved in endocytosis . The proteins enriched in endocytosis were further analyzed with their previously reported interaction network summarized in the Search Tool for Recurring Instances of Neighbouring Genes ( STRING ) database . We found that Cdc42 was the hub of the interaction network of proteins enriched in ODN - EV and endocytosis signaling ; therefore , we decided to focus further analysis on this protein ( Fig . 3B ) . Our results showed that the level of Cdc42 was significantly higher in ODN - EV than in CTL - EV with an approximately threefold elevation ( Fig . 3C ) . Further , we carried out biochemical characterizations and found that the level of Cdc42 protein was also markedly higher in cells that received ODN - EV compared with those that received CTL - EV ( Fig . 3D ) . Therefore , we decided to focus on Cdc42 in the following studies . Given that EVs were capable of carrying mRNA to modulate the function of recipient cells , we also investigated the level of Cdc42 mRNA in EVs . Our findings showed that , compared with CTL - EV , ODN - EV carried a slightly higher level of Cdc42 mRNA ( ~ 1 . 2 fold ) , but the difference is not statistically significant ( Fig . 3E ) . Overall , we found that Cdc42 was present in EVs secreted from macrophages stimulated with the TLR9 agonist ODN and that ODN - EV contained a larger amount of the Cdc42 protein , which was subsequently transferred into the recipient cells . Cdc42 enhances the cellular uptake of ODN - induced EVs Distinct endocytic pathways have been suggested in the uptake of EVs , including both clathrin - dependent endocytosis and clathrin - independent pathways such as caveolin - mediated internalization , macropinocytosis , phagocytosis , and lipid raft – mediated uptake ( 27 , 28 ) . Cdc42 , a protein belonging to the small guanosine 5′ - triphosphate – binding proteins of the Rho family , is associated with the endocytic machinery via a clathrin - independent mechanism in endocytosis Zhang et al . , Sci .

We set out to investigate whether Cdc42 was responsible for the internalization of EVs with the Cre - LoxP reporter system . Our findings showed that the overexpression of a constitutively active form of Cdc42 , Cdc42 - Q61L , in the EV - recipient cells enhanced the cellular internalization of EVs ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . However , the overexpression of the active form of Cdc42 did not significantly increase the number of secreted EVs , characterized by NTA analysis ( fig . S4 , A and B ) . The expression of Cdc42 - Q61L was confirmed with Western blot analysis ( Fig . 4A ) . Next , we went further to test whether Cdc42 was responsible for the ODN - increased cellular uptake using the same Cre - LoxP cell system . We first knocked down Cdc42 in both donor and recipient cells . Next , we treated donor cells ( Cre + cells ) with ODN for 24 hours before they were washed and subcultured with the same amount of recipient cells ( reporter + cells ) . The depletion of Cdc42 was demonstrated by Western blot analysis ( Fig . 4C ) . The enhancement of ODN - triggered cellular uptake of EVs was abolished in recipient cells where Cdc42 was knocked down , suggesting that Cdc42 was essential in this process ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . GW4869 , an established inhibitor of the EV secretion ( 31 ) , was added to the donor cells in the Cre - LoxP reporter system as a comparison to show the effect on blocking EV transfer in the presence of ODN ( Fig . 4D ) . Furthermore , when Cdc42 was only knocked down in recipient cells , the level of EV uptake was reduced , which is in good agreement with the results showing that the expression of Cdc42 - Q61L increased the EV uptake ( Fig . 4B and fig . S4C ) . After being mixed with ODN - pretreated donor cells , the level of EV uptake was lower in Cdc42 knockdown cells compared with the control ( fig . S4C ) . Similarly , when Cdc42 was only knocked down in donor cells before being mixed with recipient cells , the EV uptake was also reduced , possibly because of less transfer of Cdc42 ( fig . S4C ) . On the basis of these findings , we concluded that Cdc42 played an important role in the ODN - increased cellular uptake of EVs . EVs transport ODN and induce TNF -  release and Cdc42 elevation To gain further mechanistic insights , we used FITC - phalloidin to stain actin and examined its morphology to evaluate the activation of Cdc42 . The activation of Cdc42 by TNF -  has been implicated in the regulation of endocytosis and induction of actin polymerization ( 32 , 33 ) . Filopodia formation has been proven to be an effective means to monitor the activation of Cdc42 ( 32 , 33 ) . We showed that TNF -  induced the formation of filopodia in RAW 264 . 7 cells ( Fig . 5A ) , consistent with the previous findings . ODN induced the release of a significant amount of TNF -  in macrophages ( fig . S5 ) . The formation of filopodia induced by ODN was suppressed by an inhibitor of TNF -  , indicating that ODN activated Cdc42 through the augmentation of TNF -  release ( Fig . 5A ) . Since EVs could deliver ODN into cells , colocalizing with TLR9 within endosomes ( Fig . 1D ) , we investigated whether ODN - EV could induce the release of TNF -  from recipient cells . We observed that the level of TNF -  was significantly higher in the culture medium of macro - phages treated with ODN - EV , compared with the medium from cells Fig . 3 .

To rule out the possibility that TNF -  was induced by the impurity from the preparation of EVs , we also isolated EVs by size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) . Consistent with our findings obtained from EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation , ODN - EV induced a higher level of TNF -  in cells than CTL - EV ( fig . S5B ) . In addition , after being treated with nuclease and protease , ODN - EV was still able to promote the level of TNF -  production ( fig . S5C ) . These results indicate that ODN - EV activated macro - phages by ODN enclosed in EVs . Next , we set out to investigate whether the activation Cdc42 was affected by EVs that transported ODN . We found that both CTL - EV and ODN - EV induced Cdc42 activation in cells at 5 hours , and the maximum amount of activated Cdc42 was observed at 7 hours . At 12 hours , the Cdc42 activation almost disappeared in cells treated with CTL - EV ( Fig . 5C ) . However , in the cells treated with ODN - EV , a significantly larger amount of filopodia was observed , compared with cells treated with CTL - EV ( Fig . 5C ) . The prolonged production of filopodia in cells treated with ODN - EV was possibly due to the production of TNF -  , which accumulated after ODN treatment , exerting an effect on the activity of Cdc42 , in addition to the increase of the Cdc42 protein by EV transfer . To prove this concept , we performed Cdc42 pull - down activation assay . The effect of ODN - EV on the activation of Cdc42 was further confirmed ( Fig . 5D ) . Overall , our results suggested that ODN was transported to the endosome of cells by EVs , increasing the activated form of Cdc42 in cells through the enhancement of the TNF -  release . DISCUSSION The sensing of PAMPs is a crucial step in innate immune activation ( 34 ) . Recent studies demonstrated that EVs transport LPS into the cytosol ( 6 ) . Nonetheless , whether this machinery is a common component of other innate immune receptors remains unclear . In this study , we have shown that EVs secreted from ODN - activated macro - phages transport ODN into naïve macrophages , where it interacts with TLR9 and enhances the release of chemokine TNF -  .

Together , our results demonstrate the mechanism that EVs use to regulate their own cellular uptake in macrophages through a feedback loop , which involves amplifying the level of ac - tivated Cdc42 protein in the recipient cells ( Fig . 6 ) . EVs serve as a critical vehicle for intercellular communication in the fusion , internalization , and release of signal molecules to their target cells ( 9 , 13 , 35 , 36 ) . The influence of EV - carried miRNA was demonstrated in prometastastic inflammatory responses in which TLR7 and TLR8 were involved ( 36 ) . Our investigation of the cellular uptake of EVs in immune cells provides a better understanding of the general role of EVs in the regulation of intracellular innate immunity . It has been noted that the transfer of EVs was enhanced in pathological states such as cancers and inflammation , com - pared with most physiological conditions ( 37 ) . Nonetheless , the underlying mechanism for EV secretion and uptake has not been thoroughly studied . Our effort in deciphering that mechanism by proteomic analysis of EVs led to the finding that Cdc42 is responsible for ODN - mediated EV uptake . Cdc42 activation was previously linked to immune evasion in HIV - 1 – induced membrane extensions in immature dendritic cells , which facilitated cell - cell exchange of the virus particles between dendritic cells and CD4 + T cell ( 38 ) . Therefore , we extended our study to characterize the relevance of Cdc42 activation for ODN stimulation . Our investigations demonstrate that the activation of Cdc42 is essential in ODN - triggered EV uptake in macrophages , which may offer insight into the function of Cdc42 activation in various autoimmune diseases . Our data also show that Cdc42 and ODN are delivered simulta - neously to recipient cells to exert a synergetic effect on cellular uptake of EVs . These data are in agreement with a previous finding showing a costimulatory effect of EVs on recipient cells via the Fig . 5 . The effect of EV and ODN - EV on Cdc42 activity .

ODN has been shown to have great potential in different clinical applications as a vaccine adjuvant ( 40 – 42 ) . Our findings show that the level of Cdc42 is enhanced in ODN - derived EVs . Upon entry into recipient cells , Cdc42 was activated by TNF -  , influencing the further uptake of EVs . In summary , we have deciphered a mechanism by which EVs propagate TLR9 - mediated innate immune responses through feedback regulation of their own cellular uptake . Our investigation on the uptake of ODN - carrying EVs could deepen understanding of the role of EVs in TLR - modulated intracellular innate immune responses . Multiple mechanisms have been previously reported for the destinies of the endocytic EVs and their cargos after cell endo - cytosis ( 43 ) . Nonetheless , intriguing questions such as the topology of the nucleic acid cargo within the EVs remain unresolved . Thorough characterization of how and when ODN is released from the EVs and consequently interact with TLR9 demands further investigation . Moreover , our findings may facilitate the development of more efficient therapeutic approaches targeting Cdc42 to modulate the uptake of EVs , especially in the context of various inflammatory diseases . MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of EVs To prepare “EV - depleted medium , ” fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) was centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 1 hour at 4°C to remove EVs . The centrifuged FBS was then mixed with medium at a ratio of 1 : 10 . For each condition , cells were cultured in the EV - depleted medium at 60 to 70 % confluency for 48 hours . Culture medium was then harvested . EV purification from the medium was performed by ultracentrifugation ( 44 ) or size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) . During ultracentrifugation , the harvested culture medium was first centrifuged at 500 g twice for 10 min to eliminate floating cells , at 2000 g twice for 15 min to remove cell debris , and centrifuged at 16 , 500 g twice for 20 min . The medium was then filtered through a 0 . 22 -  m filter before an ultracentrifugation step at 100 , 000 g for 1 hour . Then , the supernatant was discarded , followed by a washing step in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) to eliminate contaminating proteins . EVs were suspended in 100  l of PBS , and protein content was measured by a bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) protein assay kit ( Pierce ) . The number of cells from all the culture conditions was counted . SEC was performed using commercially available Exo - spin SEC columns ( Cell Guidance Systems ) , following the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , the culture medium was centrifuged at 500 g twice for 10 min and then at 16 , 500 g for 30 min . The supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and mixed with 1 : 2 volume of Exo - spin buffer for 2 hours . Then , the mixture was centrifuged at 16 , 500 g for 1 hour . The supernatant was discarded , while the EV - containing pellet was resuspended in 100  l of PBS . The sample was further purified using the provided Exo - spin columns . Last , the purified EVs were collected from the eluate . Nanoparticle tracking analysis The concentrations and size distribution of EVs were analyzed by NTA using the NanoSight LM14 instrument ( Malvern Instruments , UK ) . EVs were suspended in 100  l of PBS and diluted 50 times with double - distilled water . Constant flow injection was used , and three videos of 60 s were captured . The camera level was set at level 14 and the detection threshold at 4 or 5 . Data were analyzed on the basis of the captured videos by NTA 3 . 1 software . PKH67 labeling of EVs The PKH67 Green Fluorescent Cell Linker Mini Kit for General Cell Membrane Labeling kit ( SLBR4806V , Sigma ) was used to label EVs . First , EVs from cells were resuspended in 100  l of diluent C in the kit . PKH67 dye was diluted into a final concentration of 2  M with diluent C and then mixed with the EVs ( ~ 10 7 ) . After a 5 - min incubation at room temperature , the reaction was stopped by adding 500  l of 5 % BSA ( bovine serum albumin ) / PBS . Labeled EVs were washed with PBS twice by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in PBS . Immunofluorescence and imaging Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 10 min and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . The cells were then blocked with 1 % BSA / PBS for 45 min and incubated with a primary antibody for 2 hours and a secondary antibody for 1 hour . Washes were done four times with PBS after each step . When desired , the cells were incubated with 4′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( 1  g / ml ) in PBS for 10 min and washed four times . Last , the cells were photographed with an A1Rsi super - resolution laser scanning confocal microscope ( Nikon ) . Five fields were randomly chosen for images , and three independent experiments were performed . The images were analyzed using ImageJ software ( version 2 . 0 . 0 - rc - 54 / 1 . 51h ) . EVs were fixed by with a fluoromount aqueous mounting medium ( Sigma ) onto glass slides and then observed by Super Resolution Microscope N - SIM microscopy ( Nikon ) . Colocalization quantification The extent of colocalization of two fluorescent labels was measured using the “colocalization” module of Imaris 9 . 1 . 2 ( Bitplane AG , USA . ) . The program analyzes stacks of confocal sections obtained in two channels . Green and blue channels were chosen here for analysis . The pixels of the green region ( FITC - ODN - EV ) were defined as the thresholds in the settings to calculate the percentage of blue area ( TLR9 ) colocalized with the green region . The threshold for all measures was consistent . Fig . 6 . Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism for ODN - stimulated EV uptake via modulation of Cdc42 . EVs secreted from ODN - activated macrophages carry both Cdc42 and ODN . When EVs internalize into the recipient cells , Cdc42 is transferred from EVs to cells , further increasing the level of Cdc42 in the cells . ODN carried by EVs also induces the release of TNF -  from recipient macrophages , which , in turn , activates Cdc42 , forming a positive feedback loop to promote further endocytosis of EVs .

In - gel digestion was then carried out with sequencing grade modified trypsin in 50 mM ammo - nium bicarbonate at 37°C overnight . The peptides were extracted twice with 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) in 50 % acetonitrile aqueous solution . Extracts were centrifuged in a SpeedVac to reduce the volume . Tryptic peptides were dissolved in 20  l of 0 . 1 % TFA . For LC – tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) analysis , the peptides were separated by a gradient elution at a flow rate of 0 . 30  l / min with a Thermo - Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , coupled with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The analytical column was a home - made fused silica capillary column ( inner diameter , 75  m ; length , 150 mm ; Upchurch , Oak Harbor , WA ) packed with C - 18 resin ( 300 Å , 5  m ; Varian , Lexington , MA ) . The mobile phase consisted of 0 . 1 % for - mic acid , and mobile phase B consisted of 80 % acetonitrile and 0 . 1 % formic acid . The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in the data - dependent acquisition mode using Xcalibur 2 . 1 . 2 software , and there was a single full - scan mass spectrum in the Orbitrap ( 300 to 1800 mass / charge ratio , 70 , 000 resolution ) , followed by 20 data - dependent MS / MS scans at 27 % normalized collision energy [ HCD ( higher - energy collisional dissociation ) ] . F - actin staining assay The cells were fixed with 4 % PFA for 10 min and permeabilized by 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min at room temperature . F - actin was stained with 100 nM FITC - phalloidin for 30 min in the dark . Actin fragments were imaged with a 100× oil immersion objective on a Nikon A1Rsi super - resolution laser scanning confocal microscope ( Nikon ) . Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) was performed to measure the level of TNF -  expression . THP - 1 cells were pretreated with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( 100 ng / ml ) before being seeded at 0 . 5 × 10 6 per well using a 24 - well plate in 0 . 5 ml of complete cell culture medium with 10 % FBS . After 24 hours , cells adhered to the surface of the plate . Fresh medium without FBS was used during the treatment of EVs or ODN - EVs ( EV - to - cell ratio was 100 : 1 ) , or they were left un - treated . After 24 hours , the culture medium was collected and levels of TNF -  were determined using the human TNF -  OptEIA ELISA kit ( BD Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Statistical analyses Data were represented as the means ± SEM . Unpaired Student’s t test was used to analyze data with only two sets . One - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed to determine whether there was a significant difference between more than two datasets , followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test , using GraphPad Prism 6 . 0 . Group differences at the level of P < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Asterisk ( * ) represented P < 0 . 05 ; double asterisk ( * * ) represented P < 0 . 01 ; triple asterisk ( * * * ) represented P < 0 . 001 .
