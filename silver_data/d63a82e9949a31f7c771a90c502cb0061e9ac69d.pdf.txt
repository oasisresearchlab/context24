The most widely accepted and cited mechanisms for ensuring signal honesty are based on the costly signalling hypothesis , which posits that costs associated with ornamentation prevent low - quality males from being highly ornamen - ted . Alternatively , by the index hypothesis , honesty can be achieved via cost - free mechanisms if ornament production is causally linked to core physiological pathways . In this essay , we review how a costly signalling fra - mework has shaped empirical research in mate choice for colourful male ornaments and emphasize that alternative interpretations are plausible under an index signalling framework . We discuss the challenges in both empirically testing and distinguishing between the two hypotheses , noting that they need not be mutually exclusive .

Introduction Female mate choice is hypothesized to be an important form of selection on bold and brilliant colour displays of male animals [ 1 – 3 ] . In particular , it is widely proposed that choosing females assess prospective males by their col - ourful ornaments because colour displays can be honest signals of individual quality [ 4 – 6 ] . For signals of quality to be effective and evolutionarily stable , they must be reliable such that there is a consistent correlation between orna - ment expression and some unobservable male quality that is of interest to the female [ 7 – 10 ] . Thus , it has been proposed that ornaments should evolve and be the object of female assessment only if they remain honest signals of the true condition or quality of a male ( i . e . condition - dependent ornaments ) [ 8 ] . The logical challenge to the concept of honest signalling is cheating . During mate choice , the interests of a choosing female and a displaying male are fun - damentally different [ 11 , 12 ] . It is to each male’s advantage to present a signal that maximizes his chances of mating—even if it is a dishonest reflection of his quality—while it is to each female’s advantage to sort prospective mates by aspects of quality that will affect her reproductive success [ 13 , 14 ] . A wealth of empirical data from diverse taxa shows that coloration can be an honest signal of male quality [ 15 – 17 ] , so the fundamental question is : what maintains the honesty of colourful ornaments in mate choice systems [ 9 , 18 , 19 ] ? In this essay , we review two hypothesized mechanisms for the enforcement of the honesty of colour signals assessed by females during mate choice : ( i ) the costly signalling hypothesis [ 10 ] and ( ii ) the index hypothesis [ 20 , 21 ] . The former is the foundation for the most widely accepted and cited hypotheses for how colour signals remain honest , proposing that costs entailed in the pro - duction or maintenance of colour displays ensure the honesty of the signals . On the other hand , the index hypothesis , which proposes that signal honesty is maintained by cost - free mechanisms that arise from the inexorable links & 2017 The Author ( s ) Published by the Royal Society . All rights reserved . between male condition and signal expression , is an often - overlooked but important alternative as the basis for honest signalling from coloration . We first briefly review the frame - work of the costly signaling and index hypotheses and consider their application to colour signals . We assess how including the perspective from the index hypothesis provides important alternative explanations for experimental results from two empirical studies of coloured ornaments . Finally , we discuss how future studies can better tease apart whether honest colour signals used in mate choice are shaped by costly or cost - free mechanisms—or a combination of both . 2 . Mechanisms of honest signalling ( a ) The costly signaling hypothesis The costly signalling hypothesis requires that signals be costly to be reliable [ 10 , 22 , 23 ] . In the realm of animal color - ation , costs come in a variety of forms such as increased predation risk ( 1a , table 1 ) or resource allocation towards ornamentation instead of body maintenance ( 1b , table 1 ) . However , for signalling to be evolutionarily stable with little cheating , these costs associated with ornamentation must ultimately result in a decrease in fitness [ 8 – 10 , 20 , 30 ] . Moreover , a key premise of costly signalling theory is that ornamentation will impose a higher cost for low - quality males than high - quality males [ 8 , 31 – 33 ] . Consequently , sig - nals remain honest because males of low quality simply cannot recover sufficient fitness from dishonest signalling to compensate for the high cost of ornamentation . For example , bold and conspicuous coloration may slightly increase the predation risk for a high - quality male with good stamina and agility , but the same coloration may greatly increase the predation risk for a low - quality male that is less able to evade predators [ 34 ] . Similarly , high - and low - quality males may suffer differential effects of allocating resources to orna - ment production and away from physiological functions that contribute to fitness [ 35 , 36 ] ( 1b , table 1 ) . As with predation risk , allocating critical resources to ornamentation rather than body maintenance may cause low - quality males to suffer higher fitness costs than high - quality males [ 24 , 37 , 38 ] . The unifying theme of costly signalling is that the fitness costs of ornamentation maintain signal honesty because only high - quality males gain a net fitness benefit from producing the colour displays most preferred by females [ 8 ] . Zahavi [ 10 ] proposed the first conceptualization of the costly signalling hypothesis in biology with his handicap principle , which states that ornaments pose a survival cost on the signaler such that only high - quality males can with - stand the handicap of being fully ornamented . Bearing a large ornament is a strategic cost—a cost in excess of what is needed to unambiguously convey information [ 9 ] —and thus this form of honest signalling has been termed wasteful signalling [ 39 ] . Zahavi’s hypothesis proposed survival costs as an intuitive mechanism for maintaining signal reliability , but his verbal model was met with much early criticism ( reviewed in [ 9 ] ) . The plausibility of the handicap principle was not validated until the 1980s through mathematical mod - elling by Enquist [ 40 ] , Pomiankowski [ 33 ] and especially Grafen [ 8 ] . Grafen’s game - theoretic approach showed that strategic costs could maintain honesty if lower - quality indi - viduals paid more than high - quality individuals to achieve full ornamentation [ 8 ] . This validation bolstered Zahavi’s handicap principle as the paradigm for the evolution and persistence of honest animal signals in the wild . Many recent critiques of the handicap principle argue that the realized costs of signalling—the actual decrease in fitness incurred by giving the signal—required by the handicap principle are not wholly sufficient , or required , to prevent cheating . [ 19 , 41 – 45 ] . The key points of these critiques are that a high signal cost is not the only mechanism that main - tains honesty and that cheap or cost - free signals ( i . e . signals imposing little or no reduction in fitness ) can be honest . For example , when the potential costs of cheating are sufficiently high—such as risk of punishment through harassment of cheats—the realized costs of honest signals could be zero [ 41 , 45 , 46 ] ; in other words , a signal that is not difficult to pro - duce or maintain can still be honest if cheats run the risk of paying high costs through social mediation or other means . As long as high - quality individuals and not low - quality indi - viduals gain a net fitness benefit from giving a high - quality signal , costs paid for giving the signal are arbitrary in main - taining signal honesty [ 44 – 46 ] . Despite the mounting evidence that handicap - like costs are perhaps unlikely to maintain honesty in most signalling systems [ 41 , 44 , 47 – 49 ] , research on animal coloration frequently cites costly mechan - isms , like those of the handicap principle , for maintaining signal honesty [ 26 , 50 – 52 ] . While Zahavi’s handicap principle of honest signalling originally focused on maintenance costs and increased mor - tality as the means to ensure signal honesty [ 10 ] , research on honest signalling via colour displays in recent decades has largely extended the concept of costly signals to include production costs and especially resource trade - offs ( discussed in detail in § 3 ) as the potential mechanisms for maintaining honesty in colour signals [ 50 , 53 ] . The costly signalling hypothesis is an overarching concept that extends the handi - cap principle ( table 1 ) to propose that the costs associated with ornament production or maintenance are key to signal honesty . However , others have shown that alternative cheap or cost - free mechanisms can also maintain signal hon - esty [ 4 , 21 , 41 , 43 , 45 , 46 , 54 ] but have largely been ignored in the animal coloration field . ( b ) The index hypothesis The second major explanation for honest signalling in the context of mate choice is the index hypothesis , which pro - poses that coloration can serve as an uncheatable signal of individual quality if it is inexorably linked to individual con - dition [ 20 , 21 , 27 ] . By this idea , signal honesty is not maintained by costs but is instead ensured because signal production relies directly on the function of internal pro - cesses that cannot be faked . Proponents of the index hypothesis recognize that all behaviours and physiological processes inevitably require energy , resources and / or time that could potentially have been allocated towards other functions . However , the index hypothesis proposes that the requirements of producing or maintaining the signal are not sufficient to impose handicaps or other costly constraints described by the costly signaling hypothesis . Under the index hypothesis , signals are honest because their expression is fun - damentally linked to core physiological processes—not because of costs associated with that signal . r s t b . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 372 : 20160343 2 The concept of index traits has long been accepted as a cost - free mechanism to ensure honesty of vocal and behav - ioural displays [ 20 , 40 , 55 , 56 ] . For example , in red deer , the pitch of roaring vocalizations is causally linked to body size ( larger males have a longer vocal apparatus that produces a deeper pitch ) and thus fighting ability ( larger males are also more successful in intrasexual competition ) [ 57 ] . In this example , roaring is an honest signal of fighting ability because it is an index of body size that cannot be faked [ 9 ] . However , the concept of index traits has rarely been invoked to explain the signal honesty of animal coloration [ 18 , 58 ] . Hamilton & Zuk’s essay on plumage colour as an honest signal of parasite resistance was the first time a cost - free mechanism was proposed to maintain honesty in animal colour signals ( 2a , table 1 ) [ 4 ] . They concluded that bright feather coloration acts as an honest signal of heri - table parasite resistance . While the mechanisms of honestly signalling genetic parasite resistance through feather color - ation were not explicitly discussed , Hamilton & Zuk rejected the idea that females would select for a handicap . Instead , they proposed that females would select for a ‘dem - onstration of health that cannot be bluffed’ ( note 20 in [ 4 ] ) , which is precisely what we and others [ 20 ] argue to be an index signal . More recently , Hill [ 27 ] revived the idea that a cost - free mechanism could ensure honesty from animal colour signals by proposing that condition - dependent expression of colourful ornaments can arise when the underlying physio - logical pathways that produce coloration are dependent on the same core cellular processes that are the key determinants of individual condition ( 2b , table 1 ) . By this ‘shared pathway’ concept , colour displays can be fully executed only if the bio - chemical and cellular processes of an individual are functioning well . System functionality , in turn , depends on the combination of genetic , environmental and gene by environment interactions that determine an individual’s con - dition [ 27 , 28 ] . Ornament expression matches the condition of the male because maximum expression is trivial if the indi - vidual is functioning well , but impossible if the individual is functioning poorly . Mitochondrial function in particular has been proposed to be a key physiological process that links ornamentation to overall condition ( 2c , table 1 ) [ 29 ] . For example , several recent investigations have shown that colourful ornament expression can be honest signals of condition because the pigments themselves are sensitive to oxidative stress from free radicals ; such high oxidative stress levels would reduce the colourfulness of the pigments [ 59 , 60 ] . Oxidative stress arises when production of free radicals exceeds the capacity of antioxidant systems [ 61 , 62 ] . Because core system processes , including the immune response and mitochondrial respiration , can be major contri - butors to oxidative stress when they are dysfunctional [ 6 ] , the index hypothesis predicts that colourful ornaments can honestly signal condition because of these inherent Table 1 .

Assessing studies of honest signaling via coloration While the costly signalling and index hypotheses are both theoretically viable and not mutually exclusive , research on honest signalling via coloration has been dominated by an assumption of the necessity of costs . In this section , we briefly review how signalling costs have been specifically proposed to maintain signal honesty in male coloration , focusing on the prominent concept of resource trade - offs ( 1b , table 1 ) . We then introduce how a consideration of cost - free index mechanisms can both refocus interpretation of experimental and correlational studies and offer new opportunities for future study . The resource trade - off hypothesis ( 1b , table 1 ) posits that honest signalling from coloration is due to differential allo - cation of the substrates used to produce ornamental coloration , and it is among the most commonly invoked mechanisms to maintain the honesty of colour signals under the costly signalling hypothesis [ 25 , 63 – 65 ] . Pigments , the substrates used to synthesize pigments , or the com - ponents needed for integumentary microstructures potentially have uses within the body other than colour pro - duction , so individuals might face a direct allocation trade - off [ 36 ] . By this idea , only high - quality males can afford the cost of allocating resources to produce a good colour signal and still meet the demands of body maintenance [ 66 ] . Thus , this resource trade - off conceptualization of the costly signaling hypothesis has two key assumptions : ( i ) the resources needed for coloration are scarce or difficult to obtain , and ( ii ) the same resources needed to produce coloration also serve important physiological functions . Costly signalling through differential resource allocation is perhaps most often applied to carotenoid - based ornaments because carotenoid pigments cannot be synthesized de novo within the animal body and must be acquired from the diet [ 67 ] . Whether or not carotenoids are a limited resource in the diets of most animals has been debated for 25 years [ 68 – 70 ] , with still surprisingly few direct measurements of the caroten - oid contents of diets of wild animals and carotenoid requirements of ornaments [ 71 – 73 ] . Moreover , carotenoids are thought to be relevant , powerful antioxidants and impor - tant boosters of immune response such that allocating carotenoids towards coloration comes at the cost of those pig - ments not being available for these other functions [ 63 , 74 , 75 ] . Carotenoid coloration may therefore be an honest signal of oxi - dative stress or immune system function because allocating potentially scarce and important carotenoid resourcesto color - ation is thought to be too costly for males of poor quality . Related hypotheses propose that testosterone may be a critical mediator of the relationship between ornament colour and individual quality by affecting both carotenoid allocation and immune function ( 1c , table 1 ) or oxidative stress ( 1d , table 1 ) ; in this case , only high - quality individuals could afford to pay potential costs of high testosterone—costs that could potentially be offset by the beneficial function of caro - tenoids . Although the concept of the resource trade - off is widely cited as the mechanism that maintains honesty from carotenoid signals , whether carotenoids are limiting resources for most animals with carotenoid - coloured signals and whether they are relevant to animal antioxidant and immune systems remains largely unresolved [ 70 , 76 – 78 ] . This resource trade - off hypothesis has been applied less extensively to melanin pigmentation , but the substrates needed for production of melanic ornaments are also ulti - mately sourced from an animal’s diet and therefore may be limited resources requiring differential allocation among functions . For example , the melanin pigments that produce black , brown and rufous coloration are synthesized from an essential amino acid that is also used for myriad physiologi - cal functions , including hormonal cascades and immune responses [ 79 ] . An attempt to manipulate the access to key precursor amino acids in the diets of house sparrows ( Passer domesticus ) , however , failed to affect black melanin coloration [ 80 ] . In addition , melanin synthesis requires trace metals that have been proposed to be limited in the diet , which could maintain honesty if there is a cost to allocating those metals to melanin synthesis instead of to internal main - tenance functions [ 64 ] . However , the role of these potential resource limitations and physiological trade - offs in pro - duction of melanin ornamentation remains contentious [ 81 , 82 ] . In contrast to pigmentary coloration , much less attention has been focused on honesty - maintaining mechanisms for structural coloration , though these ornaments may also func - tion as honest signals of quality . Structural coloration requiresthe precise arrangement of integumentary microstruc - tures , and the integrity of microstructures has been shown to be an honest signal of male body condition in some systems [ 83 – 85 ] . The costlysignaling hypothesis has also been adopted to explain honesty from structurally coloured ornaments with proposed costs related to production and precise organization of the components that produce coloration [ 86 ] . While the importance of resource trade - offs to signal honesty is widely accepted , definitive testing of how differ - ential resource allocation shapes condition - dependent coloration is challenging . It is typically extremely difficult to know the quantity of pigments or other resources avail - able to the individual producing the ornament , how pigment resources are allocated within the body , and whether patterns of allocation change in the manners pre - dicted by trade - off hypotheses . For example , an individual may vary the amount of pigments it has available for ornamental use at any of the various stages of the pigmen - tation process , including absorption from the diet ( in the case of strictly dietary pigments , like carotenoids ) , transpor - tation to target tissues , metabolic transformation ( if necessary ) , as well as deposition in the integument [ 87 ] . The complexities of allocation make the interpretations of whole - animal experimentation problematic because non - terminal investigations generally rely on the quantities of pigments in circulation as a proxy for the internal pigment stores . Such methods , however , do not allow researchers to distinguish between re - allocation versus disruption of uptake , transport or metabolism . This problem of ‘blackbox - ing’ the physiological and biochemical processes that determine pigment usage within the body of an animal pre - sents a major challenge to understanding the mechanism that gives rise to honest signalling . For example , a foundational experiment performed by Faivre et al . [ 88 ] is often cited as compelling evidence for caro - tenoid pigment allocation away from ornamental coloration r s t b . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 372 : 20160343 4 and towards immune and antioxidant function during immune activation . In this experiment , male European Black - birds ( Turdus merula ) were injected with a foreign substance ( sheep red blood cells ) to induce an innate immune response that was quantified via a blood haemagglutination test ; the coloration of each male’s characteristically orange bill was measured before and after injection . Faivre et al . [ 88 ] reported that bill coloration became duller after injection in all males and that dullness of bill coloration correlated positively with strength of haemagglutination response . These results were interpreted as being supportive of the costly signaling hypothesis , with carotenoids being allocated away from coloration and towards an immune response . However , with - out understanding the specific allocation processes occurring within the blackbirds , the results of Faivre et al . [ 88 ] are also consistent with the index hypothesis . Challenged birds may have exhibited duller ornaments because of a change in underlying system functionality independent of reallocation of carotenoids for immune defense . For instance , challenged blackbirds may have absorbed fewer carotenoid pigments from the diet to avoid potential pro - oxidative effects of caro - tenoids [ 89 ] . The relationship between dullness of bill and strength of haemagglutination response is also potentially consistent with the index hypothesis because a decreased haemagglutination reaction may indicate a bird that was less challenged by an antigen and therefore may have better functioning core cellular processes that also enable it to produce a bright orange bill . By the index hypothesis , bill coloration is a signal of the core system functionality that underlies processes mediating both immunocompetence and ornament production [ 27 ] . Experiments with melanin pigmentation are also incon - clusive with regard to the mechanisms that link ornamentation to condition . For example , the dark melanin patches on the wings of male damselflies are sexually selected traits that have been shown to honestly signal parasite resist - ance [ 90 ] . Importantly , melanin production in this and other insect species is dependent on a shared pathway with immune defense , the phenoloxidase ( PO ) pathway . Using an experimental parasite challenge , Siva - Jothy [ 90 ] found that males with higher parasite burdens after inoculation also had elevated PO levels but lighter , more heterogeneous wing patches . The author concluded that melanic wing pig - mentation is an honest signal of male parasite resistance because the cost of diverting resources to melanin production was too great for poor - condition males . However , alternative conclusions are plausible under the index hypothesis . If we consider individual condition to comprise the functionality of core physiological processes—in this case , the PO immune response pathway—then we might expect an indi - vidual in poor condition to also exhibit poor functionality of melanin production pathways . Melanin ornaments can thus serve as honest signals of condition through cost - free mechanisms because melanin production is an index of immunocompetence through a shared pathway between melanin pigment production and immune function . 4 . Discerning costly trade - offs from cost - free indices We have used two empirical examples to demonstrate that the acceptance of the costly signaling hypothesis framework in interpretation of experimental results is not always warranted because experimental designs often cannot rule out alternative explanations . However , just as it is challenging to clearly demonstrate that resource allo - cation is a cost to ornamentation , it can be equally difficult to definitively demonstrate links to biochemical pathways that enforce honesty in signalling systems . We propose that future studies work to clarify the mechanisms of honest signalling by performing targeted experimental manipulations that can better isolate the importance of costs versus physiological function in determining orna - ment expression . Indeed , we argue that better awareness of the index hypothesis and its potential application to male coloration used in mate choice displays will lead to more decisive experimental design and effective interpretation of results . Specifically , recent and ongoing advancements in bio - medical , molecular and genetic technologies present new opportunities for testing the roles of resources , energy , cel - lular processes and other key factors in maintaining honesty in coloured ornaments . For example , the primary roadblock to definitively demonstrating the role of differen - tial resource allocation in condition - dependent carotenoid colour expression is the inability to clarify where , when and in what quantities carotenoids are moved through the bodies of animals . Relatively unexplored techniques , such as designing radiolabels for carotenoid pigments , may be key to isolating the actual size of the pool of carotenoid resources to which an individual has access and how those resources are allocated under changing conditions . Studies of pigment resource abundance and movement can be paired with the use of new genetic discoveries— such as key genes in the biosynthesis of melanin [ 91 ] and the metabolism of red carotenoids [ 92 , 93 ] —to consider how the genetic regulation of pigment uptake and / or trans - formation may interact with resource use in defining both signal expression and individual performance . To test the role of allocation or resource trade - offs in maintaining hon - esty in colour signalling , we must isolate specific trade - offs , their fitness costs to males of differing quality and their role in colour signalling systems . Testing the index hypothesis is particularly challenging because the physiological processes and potential shared pathways that define individual quality are difficult to isolate . Perhaps the most effective means to test a potential index signal is to focus on the mechanisms generating that signal and to consider how such mechanisms may overlap with other physiological pathways involved in individual per - formance ( such as the immune system ) [ 29 ] . By performing a targeted experimental manipulation that alters the function - ality of the hypothesized controlling mechanism and then measuring the resulting effects on ornament expression , we may be able to elucidate whether central pathways drive variation in ornament production . For example , it was recently proposed that mitochon - drial cellular respiration is the core pathway that links ornamentation to aspects of condition ( 2c , table 1 ) [ 27 ] . Many aspects of individual condition that are usually invoked with respect to condition - dependent ornaments , such as immune function and reproductive success , can be traced through pathways that intersect at the level of the mitochondrion [ 28 , 29 , 94 , 95 ] . This is important because the mitochondrion is both the core energy producer of the r s t b . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 372 : 20160343 5 animal body and also a critical integrator organelle that interprets , transduces and responds to a multitude of internal signals . As such , functionality of an individual’s mitochondria may be a primary mechanistic basis for the index hypothesis ; mitochondrial processes could be con - sidered the fundamental physiological processes that determine both ornament and individual quality , thereby maintaining uncheatable signals [ 28 ] . Basic understanding of mitochondrial function is progressing rapidly and lead - ing to novel means to manipulate mitochondrial function [ 96 – 98 ] , providing new means to test the idea that colourful ornaments act as index signals because mitochondrial func - tion potentially mediates both individual condition and ornamentation . Future research into how ornament quality varies with mitochondrial function as well as with the per - formance of traditional measures of individual condition , such as immunocompetence or oxidative stress balance , will be important to test ideas related to honest signalling . Laboratory techniques , such as quantifying mitochondrial ATP production efficiency or production of free radicals [ 99 – 101 ] or performing biochemical manipulations that inhibit various aspects of mitochondrial function with or without corresponding changes to free radical production [ 96 – 98 ] , will be critical to advancing these ideas . For example , detecting a change in carotenoid coloration after experimental inhibition of mitochondrial function in the absence of increased free radical production would indicate that colour expression is dependent on internal functional - ity rather than on costs of using the pigments as antioxidants . Determining a direct mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and ornament production will be important to determine whether coloured signals are true indices of cellular function . 5 . Conclusion The diversityof . . . mechanisms . . . producing cost - free , minimal - cost signals , and handicaps at the equilibrium , will reveal itselfin its full shape and beauty when researchers are primed to look for it [ 41 ] . The entrenchment of the paradigm that signals must be costly to be honest has resulted in a widespread acceptance that allocation trade - offs define colour signals , while experimental data are often equivocal and correlational evidence does not rule out alternative explanations . To advance understanding of the mechanisms that maintain signal honesty , we encou - rage scientists to design experiments and collect data that can disentangle competing hypotheses and to consider whether alternative hypotheses may provide valid alternative explanations to observations . The costly signaling and the index hypotheses are not mutually exclusive ; it may prove that both the functionality of core pathways and costs result - ing from resource limitations contribute to colour expression and establish the observed links between condition and orna - mentation . It is time , however , to open the black box that has been erected around many physiological systems so as to better understand the mechanisms that underlie honest signalling in animal coloration .
