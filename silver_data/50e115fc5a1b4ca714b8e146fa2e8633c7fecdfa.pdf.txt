How integrins are dynamically relocalized to the leading edge in highly polarized migratory cells has remained unexplored . Here , we demonstrate that β 1 integrin ( known as PAT - 3 in Caenorhabditis elegans ) , but not β 3 , is transported from the plasma membrane to the trans - Golgi network , to be resecreted in a polarized manner . This retrograde trafﬁcking is restricted to the non - ligand - bound conformation of β 1 integrin . Retrograde trafﬁcking inhibition abrogates several β 1 - integrin - speciﬁc functions such as cell adhesion in early embryonic development of mice , and persistent cell migration in the developing posterior gonad arm of C . elegans . Our results establish a paradigm according to which retrograde trafﬁcking , and not endosomal recycling , is the key driver for β 1 integrin function in highly polarized cells . These data more generally suggest that the retrograde route is used to relocalize plasma membrane machinery from previous sites of function to the leading edge of migratory cells . Retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus provides a link between the endocytic and the biosynthetic / secretory pathways 1 , 2 . Retrograde traﬃcking machinery includes the cargo sorting complex retromer 3 , 4 , the t - SNARE membrane fusion protein syntaxin 16 ( ref . 5 ) , the regulatory GTPase Rab6 ( ref . 5 ) , and the tethering complex GARP ( ref . 6 ) . Biological functions such as the establishment of Wnt morphogen gradients 7 , the regulation of the synaptic abundance of AMPA - type glutamate receptors 8 , and the sorting of lysosomal enzymes 9 rely on retrograde traﬃcking . Furthermore , pathogens and pathogenic factors exploit retrograde transport to reach specific intracellular sites 10 , 11 . The full complement of functions of retrograde transport has not yet been addressed , however , and notably whether the retrograde route contributes to the establishmentofcellpolarityinrelationtocellmigrationhasremained an open question . Integrins are α / β heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that control cell adhesion and migration by mediating dynamic interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix 12 ( ECM ) . In mammals , 24 diﬀerent α / β heterodimeric combinations exist , which are found in active or inactive conformations with respectively , high or low aﬃnity for their ECM ligands 13 . Cell surface localization and dynamics of integrin heterodimers are crucial during directional cell migration , where polarized assembly and disassembly of cell – ECM adhesion sites determine speed and persistence 14 . Integrins continuously cycle between plasma membrane and internal compartments , with low lysosomal degradation rates 15 . Up to now two main intracellular integrin traﬃcking pathways have been identified : the Rab4 - dependent short - loop 16 , used by the α v β 3 heterodimer 17 , 18 and the inactive conformation of β 1 integrin 16 ; and the Rab11 - dependent long - loop , mainly used by activated α 5 β 1 heterodimer 19 , 20 . A number of other traﬃcking factors such as Rab21 and Rab25 have also been implicated in the intracellular routing of integrins 21 – 23 . Here , we identified the retrograde transport route as a previously unexplored intracellular itinerary of the non - ligand - bound conforma - 1 Institut Curie , PSL Research University , Endocytic Trafﬁcking and Therapeutic Delivery group , 26 rue d’Ulm , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 2 CNRS UMR3666 , 75005 Paris , France . 3 INSERM U1143 , 75005 Paris , France . 4 Institut Curie , PSL Research University , Molecular Mechanisms of Intracellular Transport group , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 5 CNRS UMR144 , 75005 Paris , France . 6 Institut Curie , PSL Research University , Systems Cell Biology of Cell Polarity and Cell Division , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 7 Institut Curie , PSL Research University , Proteases and Immunity group , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 8 INSERM U932 , 75005 Paris , France . 9 Institut Curie , PSL Research University , CNRS UMR 3215 , INSERM U934 , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 10 Ecole Polytechnique , CNRS UMR7654 , route de Saclay , 91128 Palaiseau Cedex , France . 11 Institut Curie , PSL Research University , Membrane Dynamics and Mechanics of Intracellular Signaling group , 26 rue d’Ulm , 75248 Paris Cedex 05 , France . 12 Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell - Matrix Research , Faculty of Life Sciences , University of Manchester , M13 9PT Manchester , UK . 13 These authors contributed equally to this work . 14 These authors jointly supervised this work . 15 Correspondence should be addressed to B .

RESULTS Retrograde transport of β 1 integrin A SNAP - tag - based vectorial proteomics approach was used on HeLa cells to identify cargo proteins of the retrograde route 24 , 25 ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , left ) . β 1 integrin ( also termed CD29 ) came up as the top hit , together with α subunits that dimerize with β 1 integrin ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , right ; Supplementary Table 1 ) . To validate these screening results , a β 1 - specific antibody , TS2 / 16 , was labelled with benzylguanine ( BG ) , and incubated with cells expressing a Golgi - localized SNAP - tag construct ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . TS2 / 16 – BG accumulated in the perinuclear area where it co - localized with the SNAP - tag construct ( Fig . 1a , top panel ) . In contrast , non - BG - tagged TS2 / 16 did not visibly accumulate in the Golgi area ( Fig . 1a , bottom panel ) , indicating that β 1 integrin dynamically transits through the Golgi . This result was confirmed in a biochemical assay in which the formation of a covalent conjugate between TS2 / 16 – BG and the Golgi - localized SNAP - tag construct was detected and quantified by western blotting ( Fig . 1b ) . α 5 - integrin , which forms a heterodimer with β 1 integrin 26 , 27 , was found as a hit in our screen ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . BG - tagged anti - α 5 integrin antibodies accumulated in perinuclear Golgi membranes ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) , and the formation of the covalent conjugate with the SNAP - tag could be detected by western blotting ( Fig . 1b ) . Whereas β 1 integrin drives the establishment of nascent adhesion sites , β 3 integrin has a primary role in the reinforcement of adhesions that are submitted to high traction force 28 . Although expressed in HeLa cells , the β 3 and α v integrins were not identified in our screen , and no Golgi accumulation was observed with BG - tagged anti - β 3 - integrin or anti - α v - integrin antibodies , neither in immunofluores - cenceexperiments ( SupplementaryFig . 1b ) , norusingthebiochemical assay ( Fig . 1b ) . These findings establish that targeting into the retro - grade route is specific for certain integrin heterodimers , and illustrate that important functional diﬀerences exist between β 1 and β 3 classes of integrins 28 . The aﬃnity of integrins for their ligands is controlled by con - formation 29 , and active and inactive integrins are diﬀerentially traf - ficked through the endo - lysosomal system 16 , 27 . Retrograde transport experiments were therefore performed with antibodies that selectively recognize the non - ligand - bound ( mAb13 ; ref . 30 ) or ligand - bound ( 12G10 , 9EG7 ; refs 31 , 32 ) forms of β 1 integrin , as well as with the 50K fragment of the β 1 integrin ligand fibronectin ( FN - 50K ) . Conjugation of this fragment with Cy3 and BG did not alter its functionality , as it still co - localized with the active conformation of β 1 integrin , identified by 12G10 antibody ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Strikingly , BG - tagged mAb13 accumulated in Golgi membranes , whereas BG - tagged 12G10 or 9EG7 antibodies , or FN - 50K failed to do so ( Fig . 1c , d ) . Together with the results on TS2 / 16 , these findings demonstrate that it is specifically the non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin that traﬃcs through the retrograde route . We then tested whether the activation of β 1 integrin with the TS2 / 16 antibody 33 aﬀected retrograde traﬃcking of the non - ligand - bound conformation , recognized by mAb13 antibody ( taking advantage of the fact that mAb13 and TS2 / 16 binding is mutually exclusive 31 ) . After binding of BG - tagged mAb13 on ice , HeLa cells were incubated in the absence or presence of TS2 / 16 . In its presence , 2 . 5 - fold higher amounts of mAb13 – BG were captured by the Golgi - localized SNAP - tag construct ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) , strongly suggesting that activation of β 1 integrin increased the retrograde transport eﬃciency of the non - ligand - bound pool of the protein . Using diﬀerent β 1 integrin stimulation conditions , that is , incubation with TS2 / 16 or with soluble fibronectin in the presence of manganese 34 , non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin could be detected by mAb13 labelling in the Golgi region ( Supplementary Fig . 1d , conditions 1 – 3 ; see graph for quantification ) , in contrast to ligand - bound β 1 integrin , as detected with 12G10 or 9EG7 ( Supplementary Fig . 1d , conditions 4 – 7 ; see graph for quantification ) . These findings closely mirror those described above for antibody uptake experiments ( Fig . 1c , d ) , strongly suggesting that determinants exist on non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin that are recognized by retrograde sorting machinery , and that β 1 ligand engagement promotes the entry of a separate pool of unligated integrin into the retrograde traﬃcking pathway . To gain insight into mechanisms that sort β 1 integrin into the retrograde route , the TS2 / 16 antibody was used for co - immunoprecipitation experiments followed by proteomics analysis ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . The following hits with established functions in retrograde sorting at the early endosomes – trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) interface were validated by western blotting ( Fig . 1e ) : the retromer components Vps26 , Vps35 and Snx6 , and the Rab6 GTPase ( whenever mentioning Rab6 , we refer to the two ubiquitous isoforms Rab6a and Rab6a’ ) . In agreement with the interaction data , Vps35 co - localized with β 1 integrin , as detected with TS2 / 16 antibody , as well as with α 5 integrin , whereas no overlap was observed with β 3 integrin ( Fig . 1f ) . Vps26 and Snx6 also codistributed with TS2 / 16 ( Supplementary Fig . 1f ) . Importantly , Vps35 overlapped with non - ligand - bound ( mAb13 ) but not with ligand - bound ( 12G10 ) integrins ( Fig . 1f ) , which mirrored the retrograde transport behaviour of the corresponding β 1 integrin conformational states ( see above ) . SNAP - tag conjugate formation with BG - tagged TS2 / 16 was inhibited on cells that were depleted for the following well - established retrograde traﬃcking factors : syntaxin 16 ( ref . 5 ) , Rab6 ( ref . 5 ) or Vps35 ( refs 3 , 4 ) ( Fig . 1g , left ) . Also the SNAP - tag - mediated capture of BG - tagged anti - α 5 - integrin antibodies was inhibited in syntaxin 16 - depleted cells ( Fig . 1g , right ) . The reduction of total and surface levels of β 1 integrin and the increase in its co - localization with LAMP1 - positive compartments indicated that internalized β 1 integrin was routed to the degradative pathway in syntaxin 16 - or Rab6 - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1g – i ) . In contrast , depletion of Rab11 only slightly aﬀected the retrograde traﬃcking of TS2 / 16 ( Fig . 1g , left ) , as described previously for other retrograde cargoes 35 . These functional data established that β 1 integrin followed the canonical retrograde traﬃcking pathway . Cell adhesion relies on retrograde transport β 1 integrin plays a critical role in cell adhesion 28 .

As total cell size was not decreased ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) , the spreading phenotype was most likely due to an impairment of the de novo formation of focal adhesions . In support of this hypothesis , reduced levels of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) phosphorylation at Tyr 397 , a modification that depends on integrin engagement to the ECM ( ref . 36 ) , were measured in syntaxin 16 - or Rab6 - depleted RPE - 1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Furthermore , fewer cells with vinculin - positive focal adhesions were observed in the initial stages of cell spreading onto fibronectin - coated coverslips ( up to 1h ) ( Fig . 2b for HeLa cells , Supplementary Fig . 2d for RPE - 1 cells ) , and cells were more easily removed by successive washes after 1h of adhesion ( Fig . 2c for HeLa cells , Supplementary Fig . 2e for RPE - 1 cells ) . Thus , the establishment of integrin – ECM adhesions was clearly compromised on inhibition of the retrograde route . Defective FAK signalling leads to enlarged focal adhesions , due to a reduced integrin turnover 37 . Furthermore , α 5 β 1 integrin regulates formation of small , contractility - independent adhesions , whereas α v β 3 integrin promotes formation of large focal adhesions that localize to regions of high traction force . Here , focal adhesion morphology was analysed in HeLa and RPE - 1 cells under retrograde transport inhibition conditions . Cells were plated on circular fibronectin - coated micropatterns 28 , such that cell shape was constrained and focal adhesions formed in a stereotypical manner . After plating for at least 5h , syntaxin 16 - or Rab6 - depleted cells had a significantly higher percentage of large focal adhesions ( > 1 µ m 2 ; Fig . 2d ) , and it took them longer to detach when collected with trypsin ( Supplementary Fig . 2f ) . Thus , retrograde transport strongly influences the morphology of adhesions , controlling the delivery of β 1 integrins that could confer protrusive activities and nascent adhesion formation . In the absence of retrograde transport , adhesion formation is most likely compensated by other integrin heterodimers that are unaﬀected by this pathway ( for example , α v β 3 ) . To investigate whether retrograde transport is involved in a physiological cell adhesion situation , we analysed the early development of embryos collected from conditional Rab6a knockout mice , leading to the depletion of Rab6a and Rab6a’ ( ref . 38 ) . In the developing mouse embryo , the laminin basement membrane starts to be deposited at 4 . 5 days post coitum ( dpc ) , initiating a switch from cadherin - to integrin - dependent cell adhesion . The basement membrane allows the correct adhesion between the epiblast and the visceral endoderm ( Fig . 3a for schematics ) 39 . We collected Rab6a − / − embryos and their heterozygous Rab6a + / − littermates at 4 . 5 , 5 . 5 and 6 dpc , and stained them with diﬀerent lineage markers ( see Fig . 3a for schematics of lineages at stage 5 . 5 dpc ) . Rab6a − / − embryos ( 4 . 5 dpc ) did not exhibit any visible morphological alterations , presenting a well - formed nanog - labelled epiblast layer , limited by phalloidin - labelled primitive endoderm monolayered cells that separated it from the blastocoelic cavity ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , left ) .

( f ) The white dashed lines in e have been plotted to measure signal intensity at both the basement membrane and the cavity - facing membrane . as Rab6a + / − ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 3a , right ) . Necrotic embryos could not be genotyped owing to contaminating tissue from the mother . However , because we did not recover a significant number of Rab6a − / − embryos at 6 dpc ( only 1 out of 6 , Fig . 3b ) , we concluded that necrotic embryos were most likely Rab6a − / − . Rab6a − / − embryos ( 5 . 5 dpc ) presented clear morphological alterations ( Fig . 3b ) , indicating that lethality occurred at the peri - implantation stage , similar to β 1 integrin null embryos 39 , 40 . 5 . 5 dpc embryos were stained with β 1 integrin , laminin , the visceral endoderm marker Gata4 , and the epiblast maker Oct4 . Remarkably , the deposition of the laminin basement membrane was clearly altered , and a profound disorganization of the monolayered epiblast was observed that failed to polarize towards the cavity ( Fig . 3c , d ) . In contrast , Rab6a + / − embryos presented a clear laminin basement membrane in between the epiblast and the visceral endoderm ( Fig . 3c , d ) . The well - formed basement membrane allowed the correct adhesion between the two layers and the subsequent polarization of the epiblast cells , as confirmed by the localization of their Golgi apparatus , stained with Rab6 – GTP antibody , facing the blastocoelic cavity ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . At the subcellular level , we noticed that in epiblast cells of Rab6 − / − embryos the enrichment of β 1 integrin at the basement membrane was lost in favour of a homogeneous membranedistribution ( Fig . 3e , f ) . Thisobservationclearlydocuments a significant loss of polarity . Alterations in the formation of the basement membrane are most likely the consequence of an upstream role of β 1 integrin in the synthesis or assembly of laminin 39 , 41 , 42 . Cells thereby lose polarity , as previously observed in epithelial cells after β 1 integrin inhibition 43 . 58 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2016 A RT I C L E S Ctrl siRNA Fibronectin - coated line pattern FN Front Rear M i g r a t i o n 100 0 80 60 40 20 Front Rear Rab6 siRNA 0 100 80 60 40 20 Front Rear 0 100 80 60 40 20 Front Rear + – Front Rear 0 100 80 60 40 20 m A b 13 s u r f ace i n t e n s i t y d i s t r i b u t i o n ( % ) synt16 siRNA Rab11 siRNA Chase ( min ) m A b 13 i n t e n s i t y ( P e r ce n t a g e o f t o t a l i n t e n s i t y ) T20 T40 T90 Stim FrontGolgi Nostim Merge Golgi mAb13 a b c No stimulation TS2 / 16 stimulation Chase - T20 Chase - T40 Chase - T90 d e ∗∗∗ NSNS ∗∗∗ ∗∗∗ NS Front Rear N u m b e r o f m A b 13 v e s i c l e s 0 50 100 150 N o s t i m S t i m T 20 T 40 T 90 N o s t i m S t i m T 20 T 40 T 90 4 8 20 16 12 2 6 10 14 18 4 8 20 16 12 2 6 10 14 18 4 8 20 16 12 2 6 10 14 18 4 8 20 16 12 2 6 10 14 18 0 10 20 30 Figure 4 Retrograde trafﬁcking regulates polarized β 1 integrin distribution .

Together , these observations therefore strongly suggest that as in cultured cells ( see above ) , retrograde transport inhibition also alters β 1 integrin function in the developing mouse embryo . Polarized β 1 integrin distribution depends on retrograde transport In the light of the polarity phenotype seen in epiblast cells of the developing mouse embryo , we next investigated the role of retrograde transport in the distribution of β 1 integrin in RPE - 1 cells migrating in micropatterned lines 44 where cell polarity is imposed in a binary orientation ( Fig . 4a ) . Non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin ( mAb13 ) was mostly localized to the leading edge in control cells ( Fig . 4b ) . In contrast , in migrating cells depleted for syntaxin 16 or Rab6 , a clear redistribution of the signal towards the rear was observed ( Fig . 4b ) . Of note , the Rab11 - dependent long - loop recycling pathway 19 , 45 was not required for this polarity phenotype , as Rab11 depletion did not cause a significant change in the distribution pattern of mAb13 labelling ( Fig . 4b ) .

Scale bars , 10 µ m . ∗∗∗ P < 0 . 001 , unpaired t - test . distribution of non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin depends specifically on retrograde transport . The same observations were made when polarization was imposed onto HeLa or RPE - 1 cells by plating them on crossbow - shaped micropatterns 46 . On depletion of syntaxin 16 or Rab6 , a clear loss of mAb13 labelling from the front was observed ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . The distribution of ligand - bound integrin also changed on depletion of retrograde transport machinery . Control cells showed a strong 12G10 antibody signal in the leading edge and the rear of migrating RPE - 1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . The leading edge signal was probably due to the formation of nascent adhesions , and the rear signal to focal adhesions that regulate the ‘rear steering’ process 47 . The depletion of Rab11 did not change this distribution pattern . In contrast , depletion of syntaxin 16 or Rab6 led to a marked loss of 12G10 labelling in the leading edge ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , possibly because non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin failed to be delivered there and thus could not be activated through interaction with the ECM . The TS2 / 16 - based β 1 integrin stimulation protocol was then used to address the fate of Golgi - localized non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin species . As shown before for TS2 / 16 - treated HeLa cells in 2D culture dishes ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) , mAb13 also accumulated in the Golgi ofRPE - 1cellsinlinepatternsthatwereactivatedwithTS2 / 16 ( Fig . 4c ) . As expected , the leading edge was devoid of mAb13 labelling under these conditions . The removal of the TS2 / 16 antibody ( chase ) resulted in a specific increase of mAb13 immunoreactivity on vesicles localized between the Golgi and the leading edge ( Fig . 4d ) . In addition , plasma membrane labelling of mAb13 at the leading edge concomitantly recovered to steady - state levels , whereas mAb13 signal in the Golgi decreased ( Fig . 4c , e ) . These findings suggest that retrograde traﬃcking serves to collect internalized , non - ligand - bound integrins at the Golgi apparatus for polarized vesicular transport to the leading edge and subsequent re - engagement of the ECM at the protrusive cell front . Persistent cell migration depends on retrograde transport The turnover of focal adhesions and a constant supply of the leading edge with focal adhesion materials , including integrins , is critical for cell motility 48 . We therefore tested whether interference with retrograde β 1 integrin traﬃcking aﬀected cell migration . For RPE - 1 cells on culture dishes ( Fig . 5a ) or on line patterns ( Fig . 5b ) it was found that path persistence ( that is , ratio of the eﬀective maximum displacement to the actual trajectory length ; see schematics in Supplementary Fig . 5a ) was strongly decreased in cells depleted for syntaxin 16 or Rab6 ( Fig . 5a , b , and Supplementary Video 1 ) , whereas the speed of migration was not aﬀected in Rab6 - , and variably 60 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2016 A RT I C L E S Head Tail U - shaped gonad DTC Sp ina - 1 ( RNAi ) Sp L4440 Sp vps - 35 ( RNAi ) Sp > > > > > > > rab - 6 . 2 ( RNAi ) Sp rab - 11 ( RNAi ) Sp > > > > Adult worm Posterior gonad arm a Trailing edge ( rear ) EE Retromer synt16 Rab6 Leading edge ( front ) Migration Retromer EE Non - ligand - bound integrin α 5 / β 1 ( mAb13 ) Ligand - bound integrin α 5 / β 1 ( 12G10 or 9EG7 ) ) Retrograde transport Anterograde transport Fibronectin Nucleus b N u m b e r o f w o r m s s h o w i n g a m i s d i r ec t e d g o n a d 0 10 20 30 L4440 r a b - 6 . 2 ( R N A i ) v p s - 35 ( R N A i ) r a b - 11 ( R N A i ) i n a - 1 ( R N A i ) i n a - 1 ( R N A i ) ; v p s - 35 ( R N A i ) Sp ina - 1 ( RNAi ) ; vps - 35 ( RNAi ) Figure 6 Retrograde trafﬁcking in distal tip cell migration in C . elegans .

Non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin is endocytosed and transported in a retromer - , Rab6 - and syntaxin 16 - dependent manner to the TGN . From the TGN , polarized secretion operates the targeted β 1 integrin delivery to the leading edge of migrating cells , ensuring a topical supply of focal adhesion materials , thereby enabling persistent cell migration . aﬀected in syntaxin 16 - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . These data suggest that retrograde traﬃcking of β 1 integrin is required to sustain persistent cell migration . In contrast , RPE - 1 cells depleted of Rab11 showed an increased path persistence in two dimensions ( Fig . 5a ) and one dimension ( Fig . 5b ) , and an increased migration speed ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . These results are consistent with previous findings showing that α 5 β 1 integrin recycling through the Rab11 - dependent long - loop pathway promotes random cell migration 49 . It thereby seems that diﬀerent β 1 integrin traﬃcking routes ( that is , retrograde transport versus endosomal recycling ) sustain diﬀerent types of migratory behaviour ( that is , directionally persistent versus random ) . NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2016 61 A RT I C L E S Of note , the retrograde transport eﬃcacy of non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin was dependent on the cell polarization status . When Golgi – SNAP - tag - expressing RPE - 1 cells were plated on line patterns , a more than fivefold increase of Golgi - localized BG – mAb13 could be measured , when compared with the same cells grown on 2D surfaces ( Fig . 5c ) . Furthermore , under highly polarized 1D migrationconditions , mAb13labellingcouldevenbedetectedwithout the BG – SNAP - tag system in the Golgi area of 68 % of RPE - 1 cells , whereas none of the cells grown on 2D surfaces exhibited this phenotype ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Similar to the TS2 / 16 or fibronectin / manganese stimulation conditions described above ( Supplementary Fig . 1d , e ) , cell polarization seems to favour the retrograde traﬃcking of non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin . We finally addressed the importance of retrograde transport in two models of persistent cell migration . In wound healing assays on RPE - 1 cells , the speed of wound closure ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) and path persistence of the edge cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5e and Supplementary Video 2 ) were strongly decreased on depletion of syntaxin 16 or Rab6 . During wound closure , the Golgi apparatus usually repositions towards the wound front for polarized secretion 50 , 51 . We observed that in syntaxin 16 - or Rab6 - depleted cells , this topology was preserved ( Supplementary Fig . 5f ) , demonstrating that the alterations in persistent cell migration that were observed under these conditions were not due to a defect in Golgi positioning . Of note , in wound healing edge cells , the distribution of mAb13 was quite broad under syntaxin 16 - or Rab6 - depletion conditions , whereas mAb13 was localized to protrusions under control conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 5g ) . Ligand - bound β 1 integrin ( 12G10 antibody ) was found in control cells on small structures that resembled nascent adhesions , and on elongated fibrillar adhesions in syntaxin 16 - or Rab6 - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5g ) . These findings again suggest that cells fail to dispatch non - ligand - bound β 1 integrins properly in the absence of retrograde traﬃcking , thereby aﬀecting eﬃcient focal adhesion turnover . The nematode C . elegans was chosen as a second assay system to study persistent cell migration . The gonad is formed during larval development by persistent migration of a leader cell , termed the distal tip cell , along the basement membrane ( Fig . 6a , schematics ) . The β 1 integrin homologue PAT - 3 is strictly required for this process in a cell - autonomous manner 52 . In larvae in which rab - 6 . 2 or the retromer subunit vps - 35 was depleted 8 , 53 , we observed that instead of being straight as seen in control worms ( Fig . 6a , L4440 ) , dorsal gonad arms showed an undulating morphology ( Fig . 6a ) that was similar to that described for pat - 3 mutants 52 or observed on depletion of the α integrin homologue ina - 1 ( Fig . 6a ) . This phenotype was confirmed in rab - 6 . 2 and vps - 35 null mutants ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . In contrast , depletion of rab - 11 did not aﬀect gonad morphology ( Fig . 6a ) , even on worms that presented signs of tissue degeneration , such as vacuole formation ( data not shown ) . It thereby clearly appeared that as for the cell culture system , retrograde transport machinery , but not Rab11 , is required for persistent cell migration in this in vivo model . The double depletion of vps - 35 and ina - 1 did not yield a stronger phenotype than each of the individual depletions ( Fig . 6a ) , as expected for proteins that functionally interact . Through the retrograde cargo protein MIG - 14 / Wntless , Wnt signalling also aﬀects the morphogenesis of C . elegans gonads 54 . However , mig - 14 ( k124 ) null mutant worms exhibit a type II gonad phenotype 54 ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) , which is qualitatively diﬀerent from the type III pathfinding defect that was previously described for ina - 1 or pat - 3 ( ref . 52 ) , and observed here on rab - 6 . 2 and vps - 35 depletion . In conclusion , the abnormal gonad morphology that was detected when retrograde transport machinery was inhibited could best be explained by a loss of persistent cell migration of the distal tip cell , most likely due to an impairment of integrin function . DISCUSSION We here demonstrate that β 1 integrin traﬃcs through the retrograde route from the plasma membrane to the TGN before being resecreted in a polarized manner , and that retrograde traﬃcking is of critical importance for β 1 integrin - dependent cellular functions . In the developing mouse embryo we indeed discovered that interfering with the retrograde route is lethal at a stage where cell – matrix interaction becomes dependent on a functional β 1 integrin system . Persistent cell migration is another β 1 integrin - dependent cellular function , which builds on an asymmetric cellular morphology , with leading and trailing edges onto which defined sets of proteins such as Cdc42 have to be spatially segregated for polarized signalling 55 – 57 . We here found that the polarized distribution of the non - ligand - bound conformation of β 1 integrin at the leading edge depends on a functional retrograde route , the inhibition of which leads to a reduced migratory persistence . Until now , mainly the α v β 3 integrin heterodimer has been implicated in persistent cell migration 58 . Our results identify a previously unrecognized function for the α 5 β 1 heterodimer in this context . They also establish a mechanism according to which the previously described complementary functions of both heterodimer complexes 28 can be conceptualized . Disabling the retrograde route indeed leads to the generation of large adhesion complexes , which is consistent with the notion that an inhibition of α 5 β 1 integrin function unbalances focal adhesion dynamics in favour of α v β 3 integrin - specific activities . The non - ligand - bound conformation of β 1 integrin is transported through a Rab4 - dependent short - loop pathway to ensure its rapid and local recycling to the plasma membrane 16 . Here we have uncovered the retrograde route as a complementary recycling pathway . In line with an earlier proposal 59 , we speculate that retrograde transport allows for recovery of non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin complexes from distal parts of migrating cells , and their deposition into the leading edge by polarizedsecretionfromtheGolgiapparatus . Thistraﬃckingitinerary seems to be of particular importance when cells need to migrate in a highly polarized and persistent manner , such as in 1D migration alongfibronectinfibrils ( reviewedinref . 48 ) , woundclosure , or during gonad development in C . elegans ( this study ) . We have found here that the eﬃcacy of retrograde transport can be modulated , which points to the exciting possibility of a reciprocal regulatory relationship between retrograde machinery and cell polarity . In growth factor - stimulated cells , the ligand - bound conformation of β 1 integrin is recycled through a long - loop pathway that involves Rab11 ( refs 16 , 20 ) . As Rab11 and retrograde traﬃcking - dependent β 1 integrin recycling have opposing phenotypes , that is , promoting random 49 or persistent ( this study ) cell migration , respectively , 62 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2016 A RT I C L E S our work provides a fresh perspective on the whole process : Rab11 - dependent traﬃcking may ensure the maintenance of ligand - bound β 1 integrin at the leading edge , whereas retrograde traﬃcking allowsthepolarizedreshuﬄingofnon - ligand - bound β 1 integrintothe leading edge to initiate cell – matrix contacts . In conclusion , we propose a model according to which the non - ligand - bound β 1 integrin conformation is preferentially shuttled through the retrograde route in highly polarized cells ( Fig . 6b ) . In such cells , the TGN faces the leading edge 51 and represents as such an optimally positioned sorting platform to ensure the turnaround of focal adhesion building blocks required for persistent cell migration .

Automaticco - localizationassayswereperformedwithManders’ overlap coeﬃcient , using the JACoP plugin for ImageJ 64 . Co - localization plots were obtained using the ‘RGB Profiler’ plugins on ImageJ . Kymographs of RPE - 1 cells migrating on lines were performed using the MultipleKymograph plugin of ImageJ . Surface distribution of integrins on cells migrating in lines . Z - stacks ( Z step = 0 . 4 µ m ) of RPE - 1 cells on line micropatterns were acquired with a Zeiss LSM700 inverted confocal microscope . After Z - projection ( SUM ) , cells were segmented using the automatic threshold method ( Mean ) , rotated and cropped according to the migration direction . Size and intensities were normalized for each cropped cell . Then , a normalized mean cell was represented by averaging for each condition signals from at least 10 cells of surface - localized non - ligand - bound ( mAb13 ) or ligand - bound ( 12G10 ) β 1 integrin . Intensity profiles along the migratory axis were corrected for each cell according to the cell area , and the mean intensity distribution profile and the respective standard deviation were computed for each condition . Z - stacks ( Z step = 0 . 2 µ m ) of RPE - 1 or HeLa cells patterned on disc or crossbow shapes were acquired with an inverted wide - field DeltaVision Core Microscope ( Applied Precision ) . Out of focus signals were reduced using deconvolution . A normalized mean cell of surface - localized non - ligand - bound ( mAb13 ) or ligand - bound ( 12G10 ) β 1 integrin was obtained for each condition by averaging a minimum of 15 cells per condition .
