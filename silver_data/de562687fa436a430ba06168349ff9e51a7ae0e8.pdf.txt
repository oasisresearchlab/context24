Airola , michael . airola @ stonybrook . edu ABSTRACT C - terminal Domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 ( CTDNEP1 ) is a non - canonical protein serine / threonine phosphatase that regulates ER membrane biogenesis . Inactivating mutations in CTDNEP1 correlate with development of medulloblastoma , an aggressive childhood cancer . The transmembrane protein Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 1 ( NEP1R1 ) binds CTDNEP1 , but the molecular details by which NEP1R1 regulates CTDNEP1 function are unclear . Here , we find that knockdown of CTDNEP1 or NEP1R1 in human cells generate identical phenotypes , establishing CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 as an evolutionarily conserved membrane protein phosphatase complex that restricts ER expansion . Mechanistically , NEP1R1 acts as an activating regulatory subunit that directly binds and increases the phosphatase activity of CTDNEP1 . By defining a minimal NEP1R1 domain sufficient to activate CTDNEP1 , we determine high resolution crystal structures of the CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 complex bound to a pseudo - substrate . Structurally , NEP1R1 engages CTDNEP1 at a site distant from the active site to stabilize and allosterically activate CTDNEP1 . Substrate recognition is facilitated by a conserved Arg residue that binds and orients the substrate peptide in the active site . Together , this reveals mechanisms for how NEP1R1 regulates CTDNEP1 and explains how cancer - associated mutations inactivate CTDNEP1 . 2 INTRODUCTION A key branching point in de novo phospholipid synthesis is the conversion of phosphatidic acid ( PA ) to diacylglycerol by lipin PA phosphatases ( PAPs ) , which promotes synthesis of the major membrane phospholipids and triglycerides 1 , 2 . The phosphorylation state of lipin regulates both PAP activity and subcellular localization 3 - 6 , with phosphorylation / dephosphorylation establishing a conserved regulatory mechanism between mammalian lipin PAPs and the orthologous yeast PAP S . cerevisiae ( Sc ) Pah1 7 - 9 . Several kinases , including mTOR can phosphorylate lipin 3 , 4 , 10 , 11 . C - terminal Domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 ( CTDNEP1 ) is the primary phosphatase that dephosphorylates lipin to regulate lipid and membrane biosynthesis 12 - 14 . CTDNEP1 localizes to endoplasmic reticulum / nuclear envelope ( ER / NE ) membranes 15 , 16 and plays key roles in regulating ER / NE membrane biogenesis 11 , 12 , nuclear pore insertion 17 , nuclear positioning 18 , 19 , and chromosome segregation during mitosis 11 , 20 . Recently , CTDNEP1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor with loss of function mutations in CTDNEP1 leading to amplification of c - MYC associated with medulloblastoma 20 , 21 , an aggressive childhood brain cancer . CTDNEP1 is a member of the C - terminal domain phosphatases ( CTDPs ) 22 , which is a subfamily of the haloacid dehalogenase ( HAD ) superfamily of magnesium dependent phosphatases that share a characteristic Rossmann - like fold and catalytic mechanism involving a DxDx ( V ⁄T ) active site motif 12 , 14 , 23 , 24 . CTDNEP1 and CTDPs represent a distinct class of phosphoprotein phosphatases ( PPPs ) from canonical Ser / Thr PPPs ( PP1 - PP7 ) with different catalytic cores , metal ion requirements , and reaction mechanisms 22 , 25 . However , like canonical phosphatases , CTDNEP1 has been demonstrated to interact with other proteins 13 , 18 , which may act as regulatory subunits . Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 1 ( NEP1R1 ) is currently the best characterized binding partner of CTDNEP1 13 , 15 - 17 . The yeast orthologs of CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 in S . cerevisiae are Nem1 and Spo7 , which form an obligatory phosphatase complex that dephosphorylates Pah1 9 , 26 - 28 , the yeast ortholog of lipins . Genetic disruption of NEM1 or SPO7 give rise to identical phenotypes with an expanded nuclear envelope morphology and defects in sporulation 26 . Co - expression of NEP1R1 with CTDNEP1 is required to rescue these effects in spo7 D or nem1 D spo7 D cells 13 , but expression of CTDNEP1 alone is sufficient to complement nem1 D cells 12 . In mammalian cells , the requirement of NEP1R1 co - expression for CTDNEP1 to dephosphorylate lipin PAPs is cell type dependent , with NEP1R1 required in HEK293 cells , but not in BHK cells 12 . While it is clear NEP1R1 can function as a partner for CTDNEP1 to dephosphorylate lipin , the mechanistic role of NEP1R1 remains undefined . 3 Here , we address the mechanistic and structural role of NEP1R1 as a regulatory subunit for CTDNEP1 . We find NEP1R1 , like CTDNEP1 11 , is also required to limit ER expansion in mammalian cells . Extensive biochemical data , using highly purified proteins , defines NEP1R1 as an activating transmembrane regulatory subunit that associates with CTDNEP1 through a soluble , non - membrane embedded domain with micromolar affinity . High resolution crystal structures of the CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 complex , with an active site bound pseudo - substrate peptide , reveal the structural basis of complex formation and substrate recognition , and explain how cancer associated mutations inactivate the protein phosphatase activity of human CTDNEP1 . RESULTS Interdependency of CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 function in mammalian cells . To address the role of NEP1R1 , we first generated a U2OS CTDNEP1 KO cell line stably expressing epitope - tagged CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 and used siRNA to monitor the co - dependence of protein levels . As previously observed upon overexpression in yeast or HEK293 cells 13 , CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 protein levels were interdependent , with knockdown of either protein reducing the levels of both proteins ( Fig . 1A ) . To assess the functional consequences of NEP1R1 knockdown , we took advantage of our recent observation that knockout of CTDNEP1 results in an expanded ER phenotype in U2OS cells 11 . As seen with the CTDNEP1 KO 11 , control U2OS cells treated with CTDNEP1 siRNA had an expanded ER in comparison to non - targeting control siRNA ( Fig . 1B , C ) . Similarly , siRNA depletion of NEP1R1 significantly elevated the percentage of cells with expanded ER ( Fig . 1B , C ) . Knockdown of both CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 did not result in a further increase of ER expansion ( Fig . 1B , C ) . This indicates a functional interdependence of CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 in limiting ER expansion . CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 form a catalytically active magnesium - dependent protein phosphatase complex . Given their functional interdependence in limiting ER expansion , we sought to determine the mechanism by which NEP1R1 acts as a regulatory subunit for CTDNEP1 . The role of NEP1R1 has been unclear given CTDNEP1 is catalytically active in vitro in the absence of NEP1R1 12 , 14 and the difficulties associated with purification of the transmembrane protein NEP1R1 . We first purified and compared the activity of the NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 protein complex with CTDNEP1 alone . Highly pure NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 complex was obtained by co - expression of a His - tagged maltose binding protein ( MBP ) fusion of NEP1R1 with untagged CTDNEP1 ( MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 ) in E . coli , followed by purification using Ni - NTA and size - exclusion chromatography ( Fig . 2A , B ) . As a control , we purified an inactive point mutant 4 of the complex that replaced the catalytic aspartate residue D67 of CTDNEP1 with glutamate ( MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 D67E ) ( Fig . 2A , B ) . In both cases , untagged wild type ( WT ) CTDNEP1 and the D67E point mutant remained bound to NEP1R1 throughout the purification process . On its own , purification of full - length CTDNEP1 required fusion with MBP ( MBP - CTDNEP1 ) . Cleavage of MBP caused the resulting untagged CTDNEP1 to precipitate . We thus limited our characterization to MBP - CTDNEP1 . When purified alone , MBP - CTDNEP1 formed a soluble aggregate on size - exclusion chromatography , while the co - purified MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 protein complex did not aggregate . This indicated that association with NEP1R1 prevents aggregation of CTDNEP1 in vitro . The MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 complex was catalytically active and robustly hydrolyzed the generic phosphatase substrate para - nitrophenol phosphate ( pNPP ) ( Fig . 2C ) . pNPP hydrolysis by MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 was magnesium dependent with manganese generating some activity and calcium failing to support any catalytic function ( Fig . 2D , E ) . MBP - CTDNEP1 was capable of hydrolyzing pNPP but had ~ 10 - fold lower activity than the MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 complex . As expected , the negative controls MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 D67E and MBP did not hydrolyze pNPP ( Fig . 2C ) . We concluded that NEP1R1 and CTDNEP1 form an active magnesium - dependent phosphatase complex , and that in vitro NEP1R1 stabilizes and prevents aggregation of CTDNEP1 . CTDNEP1 binds membranes via an N - terminal amphipathic helix . CTDNEP1 belongs to the HAD superfamily of phosphatase enzymes 12 , 14 . Alphafold 29 predicts CTDNEP1 to form a globular HAD - like catalytic domain with an N - terminal amphipathic helix that contains hydrophobic residues lining one side of the helix and polar residues on the other side ( Fig . 3A , B ) . This suggests CTDNEP1 membrane association is mediated by the predicted N - terminal amphipathic helix ( AH ) , which has previously been proposed to be a transmembrane helix 12 , 14 . To test if the amphipathic helix was required for CTDNEP1 membrane association , we purified CTDNEP1 lacking this helix ( MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH ) ( Fig . 3C ) and used liposome co - sedimentation to assess membrane binding . Under all lipid compositions tested , MBP - CTDNEP1 displayed ~ 100 % binding to liposomes and deletion of the amphipathic helix eliminated all membrane binding ( Fig . 3D , 3E ) . We concluded that CTDNEP1 contains an N - terminal amphipathic helix that is required for and mediates membrane association . NEP1R1 binds and enhances the phosphatase activity of CTDNEP1 . The ability of CTDNEP1 to dephosphorylate lipin in cells has been shown to require NEP1R1 13 . However , two independent studies have demonstrated recombinant CTDNEP1 alone exhibits in vitro catalytic activity against pNPP 12 or 9 - mer phospho - 5 peptides of lipin 14 . Both in vitro studies used recombinant CTDNEP1 that lacked the amphipathic helix 12 , 14 . We purified NEP1R1 separately to test if NEP1R1 could bind and activate CTDNEP1 in vitro . As a comparison , we included co - purified complexes of MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 and MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 D AH , which respectively contained or lacked the N - terminal amphipathic helix ( Fig . 4A ) . The MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 complex had higher catalytic activity towards pNPP than the MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 D AH complex ( Fig . 4B ) . However , NEP1R1 failed to increase activity of full length CTDNEP1 ( MBP - CTDNEP1 ) ( Fig . 4B ) . We suspected this may be due to the observed aggregation of MBP - CTDNEP1 when purified in the absence of NEP1R1 . Consistently , MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH , which lacked the amphipathic helix and did not aggregate , displayed higher activity than full length MBP - CTDNEP1 . Notably , MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH was activated by NEP1R1 to levels comparable to the co - purified complexes ( Fig . 4B ) . We concluded that NEP1R1 directly activates CTDNEP1 , and that complex formation and phosphatase activity does not require CTDNEP1’s amphipathic helix . To confirm that activation of CTDNEP1 by NEP1R1 was from a direct protein - protein interaction , we used size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) to assess binding between NEP1R1 and CTDNEP1 . Elution fractions were tested for pNPP hydrolysis as a readout for the presence of CTDNEP1 . When ran separately , NEP1R1 and MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH had similar retention times to each other ( Fig . 4C ) . The NEP1R1 SEC peak did not hydrolyze pNPP , while the MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH peak directly overlapped with fractions that hydrolyzed pNPP ( Fig . 4C ) . A mixture of MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH with a 4 - molar excess of NEP1R1 gave rise to two non - overlapping peaks . One peak ( elution volume , V E = 14 . 4 mL ) overlapped with free NEP1R1 . A second larger apparent molecular weight peak ( V E = 11 . 9 mL ) also appeared , which represented the NEP1R1 / MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH complex as confirmed by SDS - PAGE analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) and the direct overlap of these fractions with pNPP hydrolysis ( Fig . 4C ) . Thus , activation of CTDNEP1 by NEP1R1 occurs through a direct protein - protein interaction and the amphipathic helix of CTDNEP1 is not required for complex formation in vitro . We next compared the ability of NEP1R1 to regulate CTDNEP1 dephosphorylation of lipin , as lipin represents an evolutionary conserved well characterized phosphoprotein substrate of CTDNEP1 11 - 14 . These experiments used purified mouse lipin 1 a expressed in Sf9 insect cells and took advantage of the gel shift observed upon lipin dephosphorylation 3 , 6 , 30 . At the single protein concentration tested , we observed near complete dephosphorylation of lipin 1 a by the MBP - NEP1R1 / CTDNEP1 complex that was comparable to treatment with 6 lamda phosphatase , with no observable dependence on CTDNEP1’s amphipathic helix ( Fig . 4D ) . For CTDNEP1 alone , deletion of the helix ( MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH ) resulted in a slightly faster migration of lipin 1 a on the phos - tag gel ( Fig . 4E ) , which suggests a higher catalytic rate of the non - aggregated MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH over MBP - CTDNEP1 . Consistent with our previous observations , the addition of NEP1R1 further enhanced lipin 1 a dephosphorylation by CTDNEP1 ( Fig . 4E ) . Thus , NEP1R1 directly binds and enhances the catalytic activity of CTDNEP1 towards both the artificial substrate pNPP and the canonical phosphoprotein substrate lipin 1 a . A soluble cytoplasmic domain of NEP1R1 is sufficient to bind and activate CTDNEP1 . We next sought to define a minimal region of NEP1R1 sufficient to bind and active CTDNEP1 . Alphafold predicted NEP1R1 to adopt an elongated structure containing a transmembrane helical region and a cytosolic domain ( Fig . 5A ) . Given CTDNEP1 is a peripheral membrane - binding protein , we reasoned that the interaction between NEP1R1 and CTDNEP1 might be through the non - membrane embedded , cytoplasmic domain of NEP1R1 . This hypothesis was assessed by generating a soluble version of NEP1R1 that deleted NEP1R1’s predicted transmembrane helices ( Fig . 5A , B ) . This soluble construct of NEP1R1 , which did not require detergents for purification , is referred to as soluble NEP1R1 ( sNEP1R1 ) . sNEP1R1 could be purified alone ( Fig . 5C ) and formed a stable domain that was sufficient to increase the activity of MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH using pNPP as a substrate ( Fig . 5D ) . In addition , untagged CTDNEP1 D AH co - purified with either MBP - sNEP1R1 or His - sNEP1R1 when co - expressed together in E . coli ( Fig . 5C ) . These soluble complexes were catalytically active ( Fig . 5E ) and band intensities suggested CTDNEP1 and sNEP1R1 associate in a 1 to 1 molar ratio ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . This defines a minimal cytoplasmic domain of NEP1R1 that is sufficient to bind and activate CTDNEP1 . NEP1R1 and CTDNEP1 associate with low micromolar affinity . To quantitate the affinity of the interaction between NEP1R1 and CTDNEP1 , we used microscale thermophoresis ( MST ) to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant ( K d ) . MST experiments were carried out by addition of increasing concentrations of sNEP1R1 to a solution of msfGFP - MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH , a fusion of monomeric superfold green fluorescent protein ( msfGFP ) with MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH . Fitting of the relative changes in thermophoresis yielded a K d value of 2 . 9 µ M ( Fig . 5F , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , which is in the physiological range of protein - protein interactions . Crystal structure of the CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 protein phosphatase complex . To determine the structural basis for CTDNEP1 activation by NEP1R1 , we attempted to crystallize and / or use cryoEM to determine the structure of CTDNEP1 alone , as well as full - length and soluble CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 complexes , but were unsuccessful . 7 We thus generated several covalent fusions of CTDNEP1 D AH with sNEP1R1 that contained different linker peptides . One of these fusions had similar activity as the soluble unfused complex ( Fig . 6A , B ) and crystallized , diffracting to 1 . 91 Å ( R work = 0 . 1908 , R free = 0 . 2120 , Table 1 ) . Phases were determined using molecular replacement with an Alphafold model of CTDNEP1 , as molecular replaced failed with an Alphafold multimer 31 model of the soluble complex . A high - resolution structure of the CTDNEP1 - sNEP1R1 fusion was also determined with a magnesium ( Mg 2 + ) ion bound in the active site ( Table 1 ) . The CTDNEP1 - sNEP1R1 phosphatase complex had an overall compact structure , with CTDNEP1 adopting the expected globular HAD - phosphatase fold and sNEP1R1 forming a single extended helix that engaged CTDNEP1 on a hydrophobic surface present on the opposite side from the active site ( Fig . 6C ) . Notably , the hydrophobic surface in CTDNEP1 is not conserved in the similar human CTD phosphatases ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , which are not known to bind regulatory subunits . This suggests the dependency of CTDNEP1 on NEP1R1 derives from this hydrophobic surface , which is occluded by NEP1R1 to stabilize and activate CTDNEP1 . The NEP1R1 helix engaging CTDNEP1 encompassed conserved region 1 ( amino acids 24 - 38 ) , which is one of three conserved regions between NEP1R1 , Spo7 , and other homologs based on secondary structure analysis 13 . However , several key residues at the interface of NEP1R1 and CTDNEP1 complex are not conserved in S . cerevisiae Spo7p , which is most likely due to the relatively low sequence identity between NEP1R1 , Spo7 , and other homologs 13 . The observed interactions between NEP1R1 and CTDNEP1 were largely similar to those predicted by AlphaFold Multimer ( Fig . 6D - E ) , but Alphafold predicted conserved regions 2 ( amino acids 101 - 116 ) and 3 ( amino acids 130 - 138 ) of NEP1R1 to fold into an additional helix and a distal beta hairpin ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . In contrast there was no observable electron density for residues in conserved regions 2 and 3 in the apo CTDNEP1 - sNEP1R1 structure , indicating these regions were disordered . However , in the magnesium bound structure , conserved region 2 formed an alpha helix , but differed in its orientation and did not form any significant interactions with CTDNEP1 as predicted by Alphafold ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . To assess the functional importance of these interactions , we designed a point mutant , MBP - CTDNEP1∆AHS232D , to disrupt complex formation . As predicted , MBP - CTDNEP1∆AHS232D failed to form a stable complex with NEP1R1 on size exclusion chromatography ( Fig . 6F , Supplementary Fig . 1 ) and was not activated by sNEP1R1 ( Fig . 6G ) . Consistently , we also recently demonstrated the point mutants F30E in NEP1R1 and V233E in CTDNEP1 , which reside at the center of the complex interface , disrupt complex formation in vitro and in mammalian cells with corresponding effects on protein stability and lipin dephosphorylation 16 . 8 Given that NEP1R1 engages CTDNEP1 at a site far away from the active site and the lack of an experimental CTDNEP1 structure without NEP1R1 , it remains difficult to discriminate if NEP1R1 binding activates CTDNEP1 through localized conformational changes and / or by a general global stabilization of the catalytic domain . To assess if NEP1R1 directly stabilized CTDNEP1 , we determined the melting temperature ( T m ) of MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH in the presence and absence of sNEP1R1 . We observed that sNEP1R1 increases the thermal stability of MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH to the same level as the co - purified complex ( Fig . 6H ) . In control experiments , sNEP1R1 did not affect the thermal stability of the MBP - CTDNEP1 D AH S232D and V233E 16 point mutants , which disrupt complex formation ( Fig . 6H ) . While we are currently unable to directly assess the specific conformational changes in CTDNEP1 induced by NEP1R1 binding , this confirms that NEP1R1 binding contributes to a global allosteric stabilization and activation of the CTDNEP1 catalytic domain , which is consistent with our previous observations that NEP1R1 prevents CTDNEP1 aggregation . Peptide recognition by CTDNEP1 . The linker peptide included in the CTDNEP1 - sNEP1R1 fusion was involved in a crystal contact and occupied the active site of an adjacent CTDNEP1 molecule in the crystal lattice ( Fig . 7A ) . The linker peptide in the CTDNEP1 active site adopted a similar position as a co - crystallized phospho - peptide substrate complexed with Scp1 32 , which represents a related CTD phosphatase ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . This suggested the bound linker peptide was serving as a pseudo - substrate and had locked the CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 complex in a catalytically competent position . In both the CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 and Scp1 structures , a series of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between a conserved arginine residue and carbonyl oxygens of the bound peptides stabilized a single helical turn within the bound peptides that was N - terminal ( residues in position - 2 to - 3 ) to the site of dephosphorylation ( Fig . 7B , C , D ) . This commonality suggested the conserved arginine residue ( R158 in CTDNEP1 ) was involved in peptide / substrate recognition . To test this hypothesis , we generated the point mutant R158A in MBP - CTDNEP1∆AH ( Supplementary Fig . 6A ) and assessed activity against pNPP and lipin 1α . To discriminate between general effects on catalysis versus specific effects on substrate recognition , we also generated an E70S point mutant that replaced a conserved glutamate residue in the active site that coordinates a Mg 2 + bound water molecule and would likely be important for general catalysis , but not peptide binding . Both the R158A and E70S point mutants had diminished catalytic function , with both point mutants retaining ~ 20 % activity compared to WT MBP - CTDNEP1∆AH using the soluble substrate pNPP ( Fig . 7E ) . In contrast , the R158A point mutant nearly eliminated the ability of MBP - CTDNEP1∆AH to dephosphorylate lipin 1α ( Fig . 7F ) , while the E70S point mutant only diminished the ability to dephosphorylate lipin 1α , similar to the diminished 9 activity against pNPP . Together , this suggests R158 has two roles in CTDNEP1 catalysis , one to bind and properly orient peptide substrates in the active site for dephosphorylation , and a second involving general stabilizing interactions within CTDNEP1 ( Supplementary Fig . 6B ) that contribute to CTDNEP1 catalytic function . DISCUSSION Prior studies have demonstrated that NEP1R1 acts as a binding partner with CTDNEP1 to promote lipin dephosphorylation and that loss of CTDNEP1 , and the consequent inability to dephosphorylate lipin , leads to ER expansion . However , the effects of NEP1R1 depletion in human cells had not been determined , which left open the question if CTDNEP1 requires NEP1R1 in this context . Our finding that depleting NEP1R1 results in ER expansion corroborates that the function of CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 in regulating ER / NE membrane morphology is evolutionarily conserved with the Nem1 - Spo7 complex . Our biochemical evidence establishes NEP1R1 as an activating regulatory subunit for CTDNEP1 , with NEP1R1 directly binding , stabilizing , and enhancing the catalytic activity of CTDNEP1 . It is still unclear if the mechanistic role ( s ) of NEP1R1 also includes to recruit protein substrates for dephosphorylation by CTDNEP1 , as seen in some regulatory subunits for canonical phosphoprotein phosphatases 33 , 34 . Since NEP1R1 enhances CTDNEP1 mediated catalysis , this hypothesis may be difficult to test without observing a direct protein - protein interaction between NEP1R1 and a CTDNEP1 substrate ( e . g . lipin ) . We did observe that recombinant NEP1R1 was more stable in vitro than CTDNEP1 , which required fusion with MBP to prevent aggregation and / or precipitation . Complex formation with NEP1R1 directly stabilized CTDNEP1 and alleviated the propensity of CTDNEP1 to aggregate . This is consistent with recent findings that NEP1R1 regulates the stability and degradation of CTDNEP1 in human cells 16 . Thus , we suspect that NEP1R1 may have several pleiotropic roles that contribute to CTDNEP1 cellular function , in addition to directly increasing CTDNEP1 catalysis . While NEP1R1’s cellular concentration has not been determined , CTDNEP1’s cellular concentration in HEK293 cells is estimated to be 19 nM 35 , which is two orders of magnitude lower than the K d of ~ 2 . 9 µ M between CTDNEP1∆AH and sNEP1R1 . This raises the likely possibility that CTDNEP1 can dissociate from NEP1R1 in cells , which has recently been demonstrated 16 . Dissociation from NEP1R1 may be a critical factor in regulating CTDNEP1 function , which could either lead to CTDNEP1 protein degradation 16 , independent functions of CTDNEP1 ( e . g dephosphorylation of nuclear myc 20 ) , or association with other yet identified regulatory subunits . Future studies addressing these issues may take advantage of the soluble complex we identified that is sufficient for complex formation , and / or the fusion complex of CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 that covalently links the two proteins together and increases thermal stability . 10 While the K d of the orthologous Nem1 - Spo7 complex has not been determined , it has been suggested that Nem1 - Spo7 form a constitutive complex . In yeast , Ice2 has been identified as a regulator of Nem1 - Spo7 that inhibits function 36 . The mammalian SERINC proteins display sequence and structural homology with Ice2 37 , however it is not known if they analogously inhibit CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 , in addition to their reported role of incorporating serine into membrane lipid synthesis 38 . However , dissociation of CTDNEP1 and NEP1R1 suggests that this need not necessarily be the case , as CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 may have evolved different regulatory mechanisms from their yeast counterparts . Comparison of the experimentally determined crystal structure versus the AlphaFold Multimer prediction identified important shared features for complex formation , but also had some notable differences . Alphafold predicted NEP1R1 to form a cytoplasmic domain when bound to CTDNEP1 , whereas our experimental structure lacked density beyond the single helix formed by conserved region 1 or had a second helix that adopted a different orientation to that predicted by AlphaFold . Mutational analyses confirmed that the shared residue interactions found in both the experimental and predicted complexes are necessary for complex formation , but the discrepancies between the experimental and AI structural predictions remain unresolved . Additional experimental structures of either the full - length NEP1R1 - CTDNEP1 complex or a non - fused complex may resolve these issues . Some phosphoprotein phosphatases bind their regulatory subunits using a consensus motif 39 , 40 . At this point , given the lack of other known CTDNEP1 regulatory subunits , it is not possible to predict a consensus motif for CTDNEP1 regulatory subunits . However , based on the CTDNEP1 - NEP1R1 binding interface it remains possible that other proteins may associate with CTDNEP1 through a helix that would bind and occlude the hydrophobic patch on CTDNEP1 to mediate complex formation . Lastly , inactivating truncations and point mutations in CTDNEP1 have recently been identified in patients with medulloblastoma , an aggressive brain cancer . Mapping the location of these point mutants provides a clear rationale for loss of function . Both point mutants , L72H and W205R are in the core of the catalytic domain and would likely disrupt correct protein folding and adoption of the native tertiary structure necessary for catalysis ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Notably , both mutations are located at sites away from the NEP1R1 binding interface , and mutations of NEP1R1 in medulloblastoma have not been identified . Thus , it is unclear if NEP1R1 is required for CTDNEP1 to function as a tumor suppressor in brain cancer cells , if another regulatory subunit is necessary , or if CTDNEP1 alone is sufficient . 11 METHODS Materials .
