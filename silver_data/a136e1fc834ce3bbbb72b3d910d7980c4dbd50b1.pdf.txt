Common mechanisms of nerve and blood vessel wiring Peter Carmeliet 1 & Marc Tessier - Lavigne 2 Blood vessels and nerve ﬁbres course throughout the body in an orderly pattern , often alongside one another . Although superﬁcially distinct , the mechanisms involved in wiring neural and vascular networks seem to share some deep similarities . The discovery of key axon guidance molecules over the past decade has shown that axons are guided to their targets by ﬁnely tuned codes of attractive and repulsive cues , and recent studies reveal that these cues also help blood vessels to navigate to their targets . Parallels have also emerged between the actions of growth factors that direct angiogenic sprouting and those that regulate axon terminal arborization . D uring evolution , organisms have come to perform more specialized tasks , requiring an increased degree of infor - mation processing by neurons and supply of nutrients by blood vessels . Wiring of neuronal axons and blood vessels into functional circuits is therefore of utmost importance . The complexity of this task is underscored by the high degree of orderly patterning of the neural and vascular networks . The choreographed morphogenesis of both networks suggests that they are directed by genetically programmed mechanisms . Five centuries ago , Andreas Vesalius illustrated the parallels in the stereotyped branching patterns of vessels and nerves ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Today , evidence is emerging that blood vessels , which arose later in evolution than nerves , co - opted several of the organizational principles and molecular mechanisms that evolved to wire up the nervous system . In this review , we highlight these common morphogenetic signals and mechanisms , and illustrate how intricately the navigational mechanisms for both systems are intertwined . Lining up nerves and vessels Neural and vascular networks appear , at least superﬁcially , to develop differently . Neurons send out a cable - like axon that migrates over often considerable distances to reach its targets . The task of leading the axon is performed by the growth cone : a highly motile , sensory structure at the axon tip 1 – 3 , discovered over a century ago by Ramon y Cajal ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Through dynamic cycles of extension and retrac - tion of ﬁlopodial extensions , the growth cone continually explores and reassesses its spatial environment and accurately selects a correct trajectory among the maze of possible routes . Upon reaching its target , the axon often arborizes to allow innervation of multiple target cells . In addition to this terminal arborisation , an axon may branch ‘interstitially’ before reaching its target to make connections with different target regions . Many branches are later pruned to reﬁne the initial pattern of projections 1 , 4 . In contrast to axons , the vasculature arises through a hierarchy of mainly local movements of endothelial cells that appear superﬁcially to have more in commonwith the branching morphogenesis of other tissues than axonal patterning . During initial vasculogenesis , a primitive labyrinth of similarly sized vessels forms from an assem - blage of locally proliferating endothelial cells 5 ( Fig . 2c ) . Then , during angiogenesis , vessels sprout off more side branches ( through delami - nation and migration of endothelial cells , rather than formation of a cellular extension , as in the case of axons ) to colonize the avascular areas in the embryo . During subsequent vascular remodelling , many of the initially small vessels coalesce or expand , or instead are pruned , resulting in the emergence of the mature vascular network of larger vessels ramifying into smaller branches 5 . In the words of Aristotle : “blood vessels are like watercourses in gardens : they start from one spring , and branch off into numerous channels , and then into still REVIEWS Figure 1 | Parallels in vessel and nerve patterning . a , b , Drawing by the Belgian anatomist Andreas Vesalius 101 , highlighting the similarities in thearborization ofthe vascularand nervous networks . c , Vessels ( red ) and nerves ( green ) track together towards their targets ( reproduced with permission from ref . 9 ) . 1 The Center for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy ( CTG ) , Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology ( VIB ) , University of Leuven , 3000 Leuven , Belgium . 2 Division of Research , Genentech Inc , South San Francisco , California 94080 , USA .

The distances over which endothelial cells migrate might not be as great as those travelled by growth cones , but they nonetheless require extensive motility . A century after the discovery of the growth cone , it was recognized that specialized endothelial ‘tip’ cells are present at the forefront of navigating blood vessels and share many similarities with axonal growth cones 6 ( Fig . 2c , d ) . They extend and retract numerous ﬁlopodia in saltatory fashion to explore their environment , suggesting that they direct the extension of vessel sprouts . The key function of the tip cells appears to be to ‘pave the path’ for the subjacent ‘stalk’ endothelial cells ( Fig . 2e ) . Tip cells proliferate mini - mally , whereas stalk cells proliferate extensively while migrating in the wake of the tip cell , thus permitting extension of the nascent vessel . How do the patterns of nerves and vessels line up ? Axons and vessels often take advantage of one another to follow the same path . In some cases , vessels produce signals ( such as artemin and neuro - trophin 3 ) that attract axons to track alongside the pioneer vessel 7 , 8 . Conversely , nerves may also produce signals such as vascular endo - thelial growth factor ( VEGF or VEGF - A ) to guide blood vessels ( Fig . 1c ) 9 . The ability of axons to guide vessels , and vice versa , extends the well known facts that axons can guide other axons ( early ‘pioneer’ axons can , in some cases , be used by later ‘follower’ axons to reach their targets ) 1 and that different types of vessel often track together ( for instance , blood vessels release VEGF - C to attract lymph vessels ) 10 . Mutual guidance , an elegant explanation for the alignment of nerves and vessels , might not seem so surprising . What was less expected , however , was the discovery , starting in the late 1990s with neuropilins and ephrins 11 – 13 , that the same cues and receptors that control axon guidance also function to pattern blood vessels . This provides a distinct mechanism to explain how axons and vessels align—by responding to common cues . At the same time , recent insights into angiogenic sprouting have also revealed marked paral - lels with the mechanisms regulating axonal terminal arborization . Thus , whereas the overall logic of wiring of the nervous and vascular systems might be different , steps in these processes appear mecha - nistically related . In this review , we discuss these parallels , starting with sprouting and arborization phenomena . Axon terminal arborization parallels vessel sprouting Angiogenic and axon terminal sprouting both serve the same func - tion : to provide coverage of a target tissue . In each case , target cells direct sprouting through regulation of growth factor release . For vessels , a hypoxic tissue secretes VEGF , thus beckoning its vascularization ; VEGF expression is downregulated when target cells receive appropriate oxygen supply 5 . For axon terminals , target cells devoid of synaptic input secrete growth factors such as nerve growth factor ( NGF ) that similarly beckon their innervation and are downregulated when appropriate electrical stimulation of the target is successful 4 . Thus , unlike the more stereotyped patterning of larger vessels and nerves ( see below ) , formation of capillary networks and axon terminal arborizations is non - stereotyped , but governed by the metabolic or electrical needs of the target tissue . Furthermore , in both systems sprouting requires not merely the presence of growth factors , but also of appropriate gradients of these factors—we review this ﬁrst for VEGF - mediated stimulation of angiogenesis . VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis in health and disease 14 , 15 . It stimulates division and migration of endothelial cells , and is critical for vascular development 16 , 17 . In addition , VEGF is critical for the guidance of endothelial cells to their targets . Indeed , VEGF exists in different isoforms , with distinct afﬁnities for the extracellular matrix . Thus , VEGF 121 is diffusible , VEGF 189 binds to the matrix , whereas VEGF 165 has an intermediate proﬁle ( in mice , all VEGF isoforms are shorter by one residue ) . By virtue of their distinct afﬁnities , the isoforms produce a gradient , with VEGF 120 acting over a long range and VEGF 188 over a short range 6 , 18 ( Fig . 3a ) . In the mouse retina , a gradient of matrix - bound VEGF produced by astrocytes guides endothelial tip cells , as alteration of the gradient by either loss - or gain - of - function manipulations leads to loss or increased branching of vessels , respectively 6 . Further evidence for a role of VEGF gradients in tip cell guidance was deduced from the analysis of three mouse lines ( the VEGF 120 , VEGF 164 and VEGF 188 lines ) , each of which is engineered to express a single VEGF isoform . VEGF 164 mice are normal , but VEGF 120 and VEGF 188 mice exhibit serious vascular remodelling defects 19 , 20 . Vessels in VEGF 120 mutants are enlarged , stunted and exhibit reduced branching . Their tip cell ﬁlopodia extend chaotically in all directions , which is thought to cause lumen enlargement at the expense of directed branch formation and elongation ( Fig . 3a ) . These defects presumably result from replacement of the normal VEGF gradient by a non - directional deposition of the highly diffusible VEGF 120 . In VEGF 188 mice , a shortage of diffusible VEGF causes the opposite phenotype : that is , supernumerary branches at the expense of luminal enlargement ( Fig . 3a ) . Terminal arborization of axons is similarly directed by gradients of target - derived factors . In the case of axons , a variety of different growth factors are involved , reﬂecting the need for speciﬁcity in the interactions of particular target cells with distinct axons . We focus here on the role of NGF in patterning sympathetic and some sensory Figure 2 | Stereotyped axon and vessel navigation . a , Photographs of axons terminating in a growth cone , containing numerous ﬁlopodia 102 ) . b , Scanning electron micrograph of an axonal growth cone with characteristic ﬁlopodial extensions ( from ref . 103 ) . c , Primitive vascular labyrinth of similarly sized vessels in the retina of a neonatal mouse .

NGF regulates target innervation by sensory and sympathetic axons in multiple ways 21 . First , when the axons reach the target , their neurons become dependent on target - derived NGF for their survival . They compete for limiting amounts of NGF , resulting in death of about half of the neurons , thus matching the size of the innervating population to that of the target population . After this cell death period , neurons become independent of NGF for continued survival 21 . NGF also regulates target innervation in two other ways that are more difﬁcult to study because of this transient trophic requirement , but several strategies have circumvented this problem : for example , through use of mice lacking the cell death effector Bax , or application of antibodies after the cell death period . Thus , it has been shown that a target - derived gradient of NGF is required for NGF - responsive axons to invade their target organs , because they stall outside the target in NGF mutant mice that also lack Bax ( to prevent cell death ) 22 or when the gradient is reversed by transgenic autocrine expression of NGF in the neurons 23 . Local gradients of NGF within target organs also regulate the degree of axon terminal arborization ( Fig . 3b ) . For example , denervation of patches of skin causes neighbouring sensory axons to sprout collat - erals and re - innervate the denervated terrain . This process is directed by NGF secreted from the denervated tissue , because it is blocked by antibodies to NGF 24 and NGF has been shown to act directly on the axons to stimulate sprouting 25 . Thus , global and local gradients of NGF ( and other growth factors , like BDNF 4 ) ensure appropriate target innervation by regulating both target invasion and the formation of an appropriate pattern of terminal arborizations , much as gradients of VEGF ensure target coverage by stimulating the migration of endothelial cells into avascular tissue and regulating the patterning of vessels . In this way , common principles govern terminal vascularization and termi - nal arborization , although the molecules involved ( VEGF versus neurotrophic factors ) seem to be distinct . Molecular guidance cues for developing axons We now discuss the second parallel in the formation of neural and vascular networks—in this case , involving common molecular cues—that is , how larger vessels and axons follow highly stereotyped anatomical patterns ( Fig . 1 ) . How can axons navigate to far away targets over distances exceeding the neuronal cell body diameter by more than a thousand fold ? They simplify this task by breaking up their long trajectory into smaller segments bounded by inter - mediate targets 1 . Thus , the complex task of projecting long distances is reduced to the simpler task of navigating a series of short segments—each perhaps a few hundred micrometres long—from one intermediate target to the next . Although endothelial cells do not migrate over distances anywhere near approaching those of the longest axons , they often migrate over trajectories that are similar in length to the shorter segments navigated by axons . The guidance of axons and endothelial cells is directed by speciﬁc cues in the extracellular environment . Over the past decade , con - siderable progress has been made in understanding axon guidance mechanisms 1 – 3 . Guidance cues come in four varieties : attractants and repellents , which may act either at short range ( being cell - or matrix - associated ) or at longer range ( being diffusible ) . Intermediate targets are often the source of long - range attractive signals that lure axons , and of short - or long - range repellent signals that expel axons that have entered the target , or prevent their entry altogether . In between intermediate targets , axons and vessels are often guided through tissue corridors by attractive cues made by cells along the corridors , and by repulsive signals that prevent them from entering surrounding tissues . What molecules guide axons ? The task of orchestrating the complex wiring of neural circuits—and possibly also of the vascular networks—is largely carried out by a limited number of guidance cues . In the 1990s , four families of axon guidance cues were discovered : the netrins , semaphorins , ephrins and Slits , and their receptors ( Fig . 4 ; and see below ) . In addition , growth factors ( like neurotrophins and hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) ) function as axonal attractants and morphogens ( Hedgehog , Wnt and BMP proteins ) have recently been implicated as both attractive and repulsive cues ( reviewed in ref . 26 ) . The responses of axons to these guidance cues show remarkable versatility and plasticity . A single cue may be attractive or repulsive , or regulate axonal branch - ing , depending on the complement of receptors expressed by the responsive neuron or the activity of second messengers in the neuron , and an individual axon may change its response to cues as it develops 1 , 2 , 27 . This plasticity allows an axon to be initially attracted , and then to switch its response such that it becomes repelled by cues in the intermediate target , causing it to move on to the next leg of its trajectory . Examples of this versatility , and the mechanisms that make it possible , are discussed in detail below . Axon guidance molecules guide blood vessels We now discuss the mounting evidence for vascular guidance effects of all four families of classical axon guidance molecules . Evidence for Figure 3 | Growth factor gradients determine vessel and axon branching . a , A VEGF isoform gradient determines blood vessel patterning in the neonatal murine retina . The upper panels show the retinal vascular network in wild - type mice ( left ) , VEGF 120 mice ( middle ) and VEGF 188 mice ( right ) , expressing VEGF 120 or VEGF 188 alone , respectively ( from ref . 20 ) . In wild - type mice , large vessels ramify into smaller branches . Proper elongation and branching of vessels is determined by a spatial gradient of VEGF isoforms , with matrix - associated VEGF 188 ( red ) close to the VEGF producer cell , soluble VEGF 120 ( green ) diffusing most distantly from the VEGF producer cell , and VEGF 164 ( black ) exhibiting an intermediate spatial distribution pattern . In VEGF 120 mice , the normal VEGF isoform gradient is replaced by a uniform ﬁeldof ectopicVEGF 120 expression , causingvessel enlargementat the expense of vessel branching . In VEGF 188 mice , the VEGF isoform gradient is replaced by local spots of restricted VEGF 188 expression , inducing supernumerary branching of smaller vessels . b , Local gradients of NGF regulate the degree of axon terminal arborization . After denervation , NGF levels are upregulated and cause neighbouring axons to sprout collaterals and re - innervate the denervated terrain . NATURE | Vol 436 | 14 July 2005 REVIEWS 195 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group such effects was ﬁrst obtained for the semaphorins and ephrins , with more recent evidence implicating Slits and netrins . In each case , we brieﬂy highlight some of their properties in axon guidance and branching , before discussing their functions in vessel guidance . Netrins and their DCC and Unc5 receptors . In bilateral species , the two sides of the brain must function in a coordinated manner , requiring neurons to connect to the other side by projecting axons across the midline via commissures . Netrins were identiﬁed as midline - derived chemoattractants that guide axons to the midline by binding receptors of the DCC ( deleted in colorectal carcinoma ) family ; defects in netrin ligands or their DCC receptors result in defects in reaching and crossing the midline 1 – 3 , 28 – 30 ( Fig . 5a ) . Netrins are matrix binding , and the extent of their diffusion seems to vary from long range in the spinal cord 30 to short range at the optic nerve head 31 ( Fig . 5b ) . As for many guidance cues , responsive - ness to netrins is dynamically regulated during axon navigation . To avoid commissural axon stalling at the midline , where netrin levels are maximal , responses of the axons to the chemoattractant activity of netrin must be silenced 32 . This is thought to be achieved by Slit proteins , also made by midline cells , which bind roundabout ( Robo ) receptors , which in turn form a complex with DCC and thereby inactivate netrin’s attractant activity 33 , allowing the axons to move on ( Fig . 5a ) . Netrins have also been implicated in axon repulsion , an effect mediated by receptors of the Unc5 family 2 , 3 acting alone or with DCC receptors 34 . The evidence suggests that DCC – Unc5 heterodi - mers mediate repulsion at longer range than Unc5 receptors alone 35 . A recent study shows that netrin1 and Unc5b , one of four mammalian Unc5 receptors , also regulate blood vessel guidance 36 . Unc5b is expressed in endothelial tip cells . Loss of Unc5b in mice results in aberrant extension of tip cell ﬁlopodia and excessive branching of many vessels . Treatment of cultured endothelial cells or growing vessels in vivo with netrin1 induces ﬁlopodial retraction . A role for Unc5b in mediating endothelial cell repulsion was conﬁrmed by analysis of the developing intersegmental vessels ( ISV ) in zebraﬁsh embryos . Pathﬁnding of these vessels is stereo - typed and believed to be genetically programmed by an interaction of attractive and repulsive cues . In control embryos , ISVs sprout from the dorsal aorta to the dorsolateral roof of the neural tube . After knockdown of Unc5b , endothelial cells of ISVs exhibit super - numerary—often ectopically located—ﬁlopodial extensions 36 , and the dorsal trajectory of most ISVs is irregular , with numerous extra branches , and deviates from the normal stereotyped path ( Fig . 6a – d ) . A similar phenotype is observed after knockdown of netrin1a , which is normally expressed in the horizontal myoseptum , located midway along the ISV dorsal migration path . Thus , netrin1a seems to prevent ISVs from entering adjacent somites by activating Unc5b . In mice , the identity of the ligand of Unc5b remains to be determined , as vascular defects have not yet been reported in netrin1 mutants . A recent in vitro study has also suggested a positive role for netrin1 in stimulating distinct endothelial cells ; the receptor ( s ) mediating these effects remain ( s ) undeﬁned 37 . In this context , it is of interest that the adenosine A2b receptor , which regulates angiogenesis , can also be activated by netrin binding 38 , providing a potential route for the positive actions of netrins on these cells . The in vivo correlates of the positive effects of netrin seen in vitro remain to be deﬁned . Semaphorins and their neuropilin and plexin receptors . Sema - phorins are guidance signals that are secreted and capable of long range diffusion ( class 3 ) but may , in some contexts , have restricted diffusion , or are membrane - bound and function as short range guidance cues 1 – 3 , 39 , 40 . Semaphorins are best known as repellents , but semaphorin 3A ( Sema3A ) can also function as a chemoattrac - tant , depending on the intracellular level of cyclic nucleotides 27 . Semaphorins signal through multimeric receptor complexes : mem - brane - bound semaphorins bind plexins , whereas secreted class 3 semaphorins bind neuropilins , which function as non - signalling co - receptors with plexins 2 , 3 , 41 – 44 ( Fig . 4a , b ) . An exception to this rule is the secreted Sema3E , which binds plexinD1 ( Plxnd1 ) directly 45 . Furthermore , the membrane - anchored Sema7A stimulates axon extension by activating integrins 46 . Genetic studies have impli - cated semaphorins in a wide variety of neural wiring processes ( Fig . 5b ) . Insufﬁcient repulsion by semaphorins results in axon projection defects such as defasciculation , overshooting , aberrant trajectories , misrouting and ectopic termination ( see refs 3 , 44 and references therein ) . Semaphorins also direct pruning of pre - established axon branches 47 . Semaphorins and their receptors also regulate vessel guidance and branching . Endothelial cells express various neuropilin and plexin receptors 11 , 48 – 51 , and Sema3A inhibits formation of endothelial lamellipodia and vessels 48 , 51 – 53 . In mice and zebraﬁsh lacking Plxnd1 , ISVs fail to select the appropriate branching site along the dorsal aorta and do not track close to the antero - posterior somite boundaries 45 , 50 , 51 ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Knockdown of Sema3a1 and Sema3a2 in zebraﬁsh largely phenocopied the Plxnd1 knockdown pheno - type 51 , suggesting that vascular misguidance may result from dis - rupted Sema3A / Plxnd1 - mediated repulsion . ISVs express Plxnd1 and navigate through the intersomitic corridors , which express Sema3a1 and Sema3a2 within their deeper layers , thereby preventing the ISVs from entering the somites . In zebraﬁsh , Sema3A homologues presumably activate Plxnd1 by binding a neuropilin ; however , it has not yet been examined whether they can bind Plxnd1 directly . In mice , the Plxnd1 mutant phenotype may reﬂect primarily loss of repulsion by Sema3E , which binds Plxnd1 directly rather than via a neuro - pilin 45 ( Fig . 4c ) , although evidence for an involvement of Sema3A , functioning to inhibit integrin function , has also been obtained 53 . Figure 4 | Principal axon guidance cues and their receptors . a , Schematic representation of the four major classes of axon guidance ligands and their receptors ; the numbers in brackets refer to the number of known molecules in mammals . b , Role of neuropilin – plexin signalling in axon and vessel guidance . Guidance of axon growth cones is dependent on binding of Sema3A to neuropilin1 ( Npn1 ) , which induces signalling through its plexin co - receptors . c , Guidance of vessels is regulated by binding of Sema3E to Plxnd1 directly , independently of Npn1 . In addition , by binding VEGF , Npn1 regulates vessel guidance as a co - receptor of VEGFR - 2 . Whether binding of Sema3A to Npn1 ( and activation of plexins ) also contributes signiﬁcantly to vessel navigation remains to be elucidated . REVIEWS NATURE | Vol 436 | 14 July 2005 196 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group Neuropilins have also been implicated in vessel patterning—but interestingly , this probably reﬂects their role in modulating VEGF rather than semaphorin signalling . Neuropilin2 is expressed in veins and lymph vessels , and defects in these vessels are observed in neuropilin2 mutant mice 54 . Neuropilin1 is expressed widely in the developing vasculature , and mice or zebraﬁsh lacking ( endothelial ) neuropilin1 or both neuropilins exhibit branching and remodelling defects , improper routing and connections , and ectopic termination of vessels 55 – 57 . Because neuropilins are receptors for class 3 sema - phorins , these results might be interpreted as reﬂecting loss of semaphorin signalling . However , neuropilins are also receptors for speciﬁc VEGF isoforms ( VEGF 165 ) and modulate the activity of VEGF receptors 11 ; moreover , VEGF 165 competes with Sema3A for binding to neuropilins 48 ( Fig . 4c ) . That the vascular role of neuro - pilin1 may reﬂect loss of VEGF rather than Sema3A signalling is suggested by ﬁndings that mice expressing a variant neuropilin1 only capable of binding VEGF , but not semaphorins , do not exhibit vascular defects 57 . This suggests that a major role for the neuropilins in vascular patterning is as VEGF co - receptors ; whether they also mediate semaphorin signals or whether semaphorins signal princi - pally via direct binding to plexins in endothelial cells remains to be explored . Beyond these details , the underlying logic behind the curious duality of neuropilins as simultaneous semaphorin and VEGF receptors also remains to be elucidated . Slits and their Robo receptors . Members of the Robo receptor family 58 , 59 bind Slits ( Fig . 4a ) , which were identiﬁed simultaneously as repellents for some axons 60 – 62 and as stimulators of branching and elongation of other axons 63 —reiterating the theme that guidance cues often have dual roles . Secreted Slits function as long - or shorter - range guidance cues . In ﬂies or nematodes lacking Slit , axons that normally nevercross the midline now do so , whereas other axons that normally cross the midline only once cross it several times ; thus , Slit prevents ipsilaterally projecting neurons from crossing the midline and contralaterally projecting neurons from re - crossing . Mammals have three Slit genes , all of which are expressed by midline cells 61 ; analysis of a triple Slit knockout showed that they also function to expel crossing axons from the midline , a repulsive effect transduced , at least in part , by Robo1 and Robo2 ( ref . 64 ; Fig . 5a ) . A switch ensures that Slits expel crossing axons only after and not before they cross the midline . There seem to be two components to this switch . First , expression of Robo receptors is low before midline crossing , and upregulated after crossing 58 , 64 . In Drosophila , Robo expression before reaching the midline is repressed by the regulatory protein Commissureless ( Comm ) 65 , which keeps Robo receptors intracellu - larly away from the axonal surface 66 , 67 . Upon crossing , this repressive action of Comm is lost , so that surface expression of Robo and , concomitantly , Slit sensitivity is upregulated . A second component recently discovered in mammals involves the Robo family member Robo3 ( also known as Rig1 ) , which appears to be an anti - Robo : it is highly expressed before axons cross the midline and functions to prevent premature activation of Slit – Robo repulsion before midline crossing by silencing Robo1 ( ref . 68 ; Fig . 5a ) . Thus , in mice or humans with mutations in Robo3 , axons fail to cross the midline 68 , 69 , apparently because of premature activation of Robo1 signalling 68 . By keeping Robo expression low and silenced before crossing , both components of the switch ensure that axons cross the midline . Upregulation of Robo receptors , and downregulation of Robo3 , ensure that Slit - mediated repulsion of axons initiates only after midline crossing ( Fig . 5a ) . Together with the silencing of midline attraction described above , this mechanism ensures that axons leave the midline efﬁciently . Slit – Robo signalling also controls many other guidance events . For example , in Drosophila , a combinatorial code of Robo receptors controls the lateral positions of commissural axons after they have crossed the midline and turned longitudinally 70 , 71 . Slits also guide ipsilateral and contralateral axons through the optic chiasm by providing a repulsive corridor 72 ( Fig . 5b ) , and are implicated in dendritic guidance 73 . Recently , a vascular - speciﬁc Robo homologue , Robo4 , has been identiﬁed 74 . In vitro , Robo4 bound Slit2 in one study 74 , although another failed to detect such binding 75 . Slit2 can repel endothelial cells in vitro , and Robo4 may mediate this effect 74 . Intriguingly , another study reported that soluble Robo4 inhibited angiogenesis , Figure5 | Mechanismsregulatingmidlineaxonguidance . a , Rolesofnetrin – DCC and Slit – Robo signalling in the crossing of commissural axons at the spinal cord midline in mammals .

SurroundrepulsionbySlits ( Slit1andSlit2 ) and semaphorins ( Sema5A ) prevents RGC axons from straying from their path , whereas repulsive ephrinB ligands ( ephrinB2 ) prevent EphB - expressing ipsilateral axons from crossing the midline . ( Adapted from ref . 100 . ) NATURE | Vol 436 | 14 July 2005 REVIEWS 197 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group but none of the Slits was found to bind this soluble protein 75 . Further studies will help to determine the extent to which Robo4 mediates the effects of Slit on endothelial cells in vitro . A Robo4 knockdown study in zebraﬁsh showed that some Robo4 - expressing ISVs failed to sprout from the aorta or arrested midway through their dorsal migration path , whereas others deviated from their normal dorsal trajectory 76 . It remains to be determined whether Robo4 mediates attractive or repulsive signals . Indeed , the impaired sprouting and dorsal extension of the ISVs in Robo4 knockdown embryos might be interpreted as an inability to respond to a chemoattractant signal , but misrouting of the ISVs might also be explained by their unrespon - siveness to repulsive signals alongside their normal path . Thus , additional studies on Slits and Robos are required to determine how they contribute to vascular development in vivo . Slit – Robo inter - actions have also been implicated in establishing the non - stereotyped , chaotic vascular network in a tumour model 77 , but the generality of this observation to other tumours remains to be explored . Ephrins and their Eph receptors . Another principal class of short - range axon guidance molecules is the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands 78 ( Fig . 4a ) . The 13 Eph receptors in mammals are categorized into A ( EphA1 – 8 ) and B ( EphB1 – 4 and EphB6 ) subfamilies . The eight ephrin ligands comprise ephrinA1 – 5 , which are tethered to the membrane via a glycosyl - phosphatidyl - inositol anchor , and ephrinB1 – 3 , which contain transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions . EphrinA ligands bind EphA receptors , and ephrinB ligands bind EphB receptors ; only a modest degree of cross - reactivity between the families has been observed ; for example , EphA4 binds some B class ephrins . Eph receptors and ephrins initiate bidirectional signalling in cells expressing Eph receptors ( forward signalling ) or ephrinB ligands ( reverse signalling ) . Ephrins were ﬁrst identiﬁed as repellent axon guidance molecules through studies on topographic retinotectal projections 79 , 80 , and subsequently have been implicated as both negative and positive cues in other wiring processes : axon guidance at the midline , dendritic spine formation , formation of segregated maps , guidance of neuronal cells , and synaptic plasticity 78 . We illustrate the functions of ephrins by reference to their roles in retinal axon guidance . To establish binocular vision , retinal ganglion cell ( RGC ) axons from both eyes need to converge on the same target area of the brain . The optic chiasm functions as a midline intermediate target where RGCs choose to project their axons to the ipsilateral or contralateral side of the brain . EphrinB2 is expressed in the chiasm and repels axons of ipsilaterally projecting RGCs 81 , 82 ( Fig . 5b ) . Consistent with this , EphB1 , a receptor for ephrinB2 , is found exclusively in retinal regions giving rise to the ipsilateral projection , and loss of EphB1 reduces ipsilateral projections 82 . Ephrins also regulate crossing of other axons at the midline 83 , 84 . Ephrins also determine the topographic projection of RGCs to the midbrain superior colliculus in mammals . RGC axons from thenasal retinawith low EphAdensity projectto theposteriorsuperior colliculus , where they encounter higher levels of ephrinA repellents , whereas RGC axons from the temporal retina expressing a high density of EphA receptors project to the anterior superior colliculus , with low expression of ephrinA repellents 78 – 80 . Relative rather than absolute levels of repellent gradients appear to be important 85 , 86 . Indeed , growth of RGC axons is promoted at low ephrinA concentrations in the anterior superior colliculus , but then inhibited at high ephrinA2 concentrations in the posterior superior colliculus , thus helping growth arrest at a site along the anterior – posterior axis of the superior colliculus where both growth - promoting and repellent signals are balanced 87 . The location of this neutral point is determined both by the anterior – posterior ephrinA gradient in the superior colliculus and by the naso - temporal gradient of EphA in the retina . Eph – ephrin signals also control vascular development 88 . Some of these guidance molecules were among the ﬁrst factors found to be expressed selectively in either arteries or veins . Historically , haemo - dynamic pressure differences were presumed to regulate the differ - entiation of high - pressure vessels into arteries and low - pressure vessels into veins . Expression analysis and loss - of - function studies in mice indicated , however , that EphB4 and ephrinB2 are expressed in developing veins and arteries , respectively , and are critical for their maintenance 12 , 13 , 89 . These studies indicated that repulsive ephrinB2 – EphB4 signalling—both forward and reverse—may prevent inter - mixing of venous and arterial endothelial cells , secure assembly of ‘like’ endothelial cells and demarcate arterial – venous cell bound - aries 90 – 92 ( Fig . 6e ) —similar to how ephrins sort neural cells during segmentation of the vertebrate hindbrain into rhombomeres . Ephrins also regulate vessel guidance and morphogenesis . Repul - sive ephrin – Eph signals provide short - range guidance cues for vessels to navigate through tissue boundaries . For instance , ephrinB2 repels EphB3 / EphB4 - expressing ISVs from entering somites 12 , 13 , 93 ( Fig . 5a , b ) . But the role of ephrin / Ephs may not be so simple— indeed , ephrin – Eph interactions may also provide attractive cues and induce capillary sprouting in other contexts . For instance , juxtacrine expression of ephrinB ligands and EphBs on adjacent endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells in the same vessel may provide bidirec - tional signals for establishing contact - dependent communication , and promote vessel assembly , sprouting and maturation 13 . EphrinA ligands may also function as positive regulators of vascular morpho - genesis . In the adult , ephrinA1 , expressed on tumour cells , has been Figure 6 | Role of guidance signals in intersomitic vessel guidance . a , Schematic representation of the zebraﬁsh embryo trunk , showing the somites ( red ) producing the indicated guidance cues and ISVs ( blue ) producing the indicated receptors . b , In the absence of these guidance cues , the ISVs are misrouted . c , Stereotyped pattern of ISVs in zebraﬁsh embryos ( the endothelial cells express an eGFP transgene ) . d , After knockdown ( KD ) of netrin1b , the ISVs are misguided . e , Artery , ramifying into capillaries , which drain into veins .

In addition , repulsive ephrin – Eph signals provide short range guidance cues for vessels to navigate through tissue boundaries .

Conclusions and perspectives Half a millennium ago , Vesalius documented that blood vessels and nerve ﬁbres are highly branched in stereotyped patterns . Vessels , which arose later in evolution than nerves , appear to have co - opted the same evolutionarily conserved guidance cues that help axons to navigate to their targets . These ﬁndings , as well as the realization that vascular and neural morphogenesis shares many more processes than originally thought 96 , has opened new research avenues and has also raised numerous intriguing questions . First , a variety of distinct growth factors regulate axon terminal arborization in a neuron - and tissue - speciﬁc way . Will there be tissue - speciﬁc regulators of angio - genic sprouting as well ? EG - VEGF , an angiogenic mitogen selective for endocrine gland endothelial cells 97 , provides one example , but it is unclear whether it is an exception or the rule . Second , will other factors more recently implicated in axon guidance—particularly morphogens such as Hedgehogs , BMPs and Wnts—also be found to regulate vessel morphogenesis ? Evidence for such involvement is already provided by the recent ﬁnding that proper retinal vascular - ization requires activation of the Wnt receptor frizzled 4 by norrin , which is impaired in Norrie’s disease and familial exudative vitreo - retinopathy 98 . Members of the ﬁbroblast growth factor family also remain strong candidates for regulating both processes 1 – 3 , 5 . Third , pruning of small vessels and axon terminal arborizations can result from a reduction in positive branching signals ( like VEGF and NGF ) , but in the case of axons can also be triggered by semaphorins 47 —will repellents also act as ‘pruning signals’ for vessels ? Fourth , silencing of a repellent receptor allows an axon to navigate to its target but , once passed by , activation of the receptor will ensure that the axon does not backtrack—does such sophisticated regulation of responsiveness also allow vessels to take turns , cross boundaries and reach their targets ? Finally , axon guidance cues guide vessels , but do vessel guidance cues also guide axons ? The reports that VEGF modulates growth cone movements 48 , regulates neuronal patterning 99 and is critical for maintenance of neuronal circuitry justify further inves - tigation of possible axon guidance effects of this canonical angiogenic factor . Finally , discovering how and which signals guide vessels and nerves might also offer novel therapeutic opportunities . Indeed , the evidence that blocking a guidance molecule may impair tumour angiogenesis in an animal model already provides a ﬁrst glimpse of this therapeutic potential 77 , with many more likely to follow . 1 .
