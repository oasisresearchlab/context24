SIGNALING AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY Rac1 is essential for phospholipase C - γ 2 activation in platelets Irina Pleines & Margitta Elvers & Amrei Strehl & Miroslava Pozgajova & David Varga - Szabo & Frauke May & Anna Chrostek - Grashoff & Cord Brakebusch & Bernhard Nieswandt Received : 26 June 2008 / Revised : 17 July 2008 / Accepted : 1 August 2008 / Published online : 13 August 2008 # Springer - Verlag 2008 Abstract Platelet activation at sites of vascular injury is triggered through different signaling pathways leading to activation of phospholipase ( PL ) C β or PLC γ 2 . Active PLCs trigger Ca 2 + mobilization and entry , which is a prerequisite for adhesion , secretion , and thrombus forma - tion . PLC β isoenzymes are activated downstream of G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , whereas PLC γ 2 is activated downstream of immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif ( ITAM ) - coupled receptors , such as the major platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein ( GP ) VI or CLEC - 2 . The mechanisms underlying PLC regulation are not fully understood . An involvement of small GTPases of the Rho family ( Rho , Rac , Cdc42 ) in PLC activation has been proposed but this has not been investigated in platelets . We here show that murine platelets lacking Rac1 display severely impaired GPVI - or CLEC - 2 - dependent activation and aggregation . This defect was associated with impaired production of inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) and intracellular calcium mobilization suggesting inappropriate activation of PLC γ 2 despite normal tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of the enzyme . Rac1 − / − platelets displayed defective thrombus formation on collagen under flow conditions which could be fully restored by co - infusion of ADP and the TxA 2 analog U46619 , indicating that impaired GPVI - , but not G - protein signaling , was responsible for the observed defect . In line with this , Rac1 − / − mice were protected in two collagen - dependent arterial thrombosis models . Together , these results demonstrate that Rac1 is essential for ITAM - dependent PLC γ 2 activation in platelets and that this is critical for thrombus formation in vivo .

Nieswandt Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Pathobiochemistry , University of Würzburg , Würzburg , Germany RC rhodocytin SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate TxA 2 thromboxane A 2 vWF von Willebrand factor Introduction Platelet activation and aggregation at sites of vascular injury is essential to arrest posttraumatic blood loss but may also be harmful by occluding diseased vessels leading to myocardial infarction or stroke [ 1 , 2 ] . Elevations in [ Ca 2 + ] i are a central step during platelet activation and a prerequi - site for proper cellular responses such as adhesion , degranulation , and expression of coagulant activity . Two major signaling pathways exist in platelets to trigger elevations in [ Ca 2 + ] i . Soluble agonists such as thrombin , ADP , and thromboxane A2 ( TxA 2 ) stimulate receptors that couple to heterotrimeric G proteins ( Gq ) and lead to activation of phospholipase ( PL ) C β [ 3 ] . The other pathway is similar to that used by immunoreceptors and involves tyrosine phosphorylation cascades downstream of the receptor - associated immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif ( ITAM ) culminating in the activation of effector enzymes , most notably PLC γ 2 [ 4 ] . This pathway is triggered by activation of the collagen receptor glycoprotein ( GP ) VI [ 5 ] or C - type lectin - like receptor 2 ( CLEC - 2 ) , the receptor for the snake venom toxin rhodocytin ( RC ) [ 6 ] . In both cases , activated PLCs produce inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( IP 3 ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) . IP 3 then triggers Ca 2 + mobilization from intracellular stores and subsequent store - operated Ca 2 + entry ( SOCE ) [ 7 , 8 ] , whereas DAG activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) and may contribute to Ca 2 + entry by non - SOCE mechanisms [ 9 ] . The exact mechanisms of PLC regulation in platelets are not fully understood . While PLC β activation occurs through βγ dimers and / or the G α q subunits of hetero - trimeric G proteins , PLC γ 2 is activated by tyrosine kinases and may also involve the binding of cofactors , such as small guanosine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) of the Rho family [ 10 – 13 ] . Platelets express high levels of Rho family GTPases , including RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 which shift from the inactive ( GDP - bound ) to the active ( GTP - bound ) state in response to agonist - induced receptor stimulation and interact with downstream effector proteins . The significance of these processes for cellular activation is not fully understood , but they are thought to be critical for reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton , the change from discoid to spheric shape , and spreading on immobi - lized ligands [ 14 – 17 ] . Thereby , the surface of the cell is largely increased which may be required to strengthen its interaction with the vessel wall or other platelets . Three Rac GTPases exist ( Rac1 , 2 , 3 ) , but only Rac1 has been found to be expressed in detectable amounts in platelets [ 17 ] . Rac1 activation downstream of G - protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) stimulation , e . g . , by thrombin is firmly established [ 18 – 21 ] , and previous studies have indicated that Rac1 may become activated downstream of integrin α IIb β 3 , thereby regulating lamellipodia formation [ 16 ] . This was recently confirmed by McCarty and co - workers in Rac1 - deficient murine platelets who , in addition , observed an unexplained selective impairment of GPVI - , but not GPCR - induced aggregation [ 17 ] . In contrast to that study , Akbar and co - workers reported a general secretion defect in Rac1 - deficient murine platelets and in human platelets treated with a selective Rac1 inhibitor [ 22 ] . The role of Rac1 downstream of ITAM - coupled receptor activation has not been analyzed in detail . Although several studies demonstrated Rac1 activation in response to GPVI / ITAM stimulation , this has mostly been attributed to the action of released G - protein coupled agonists [ 21 , 23 ] . However , using heterologous cell systems and cell - free assays , Piechulek and colleagues have recently shown that Rac1 may be involved in the activation of PLC γ 2 by a mechanism independent of protein tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of the enzyme , thereby providing a possible direct link between GPVI signaling and Rac1 activity [ 13 ] . In the current study , we show that the activation of PLC γ 2 , but not PLC β , is severely impaired in Rac1 - deficient platelets , leading to defective GPVI / ITAM - dependent acti - vation and thrombus formation in vitro and in vivo . Materials and methods Generation of mice with Rac1 − / − platelets To produce mice lacking Rac1 in megakaryocytes and platelets , mice in which the Rac1 gene is flanked by loxP sites ( Rac1 fl ) [ 24 ] were crossed with transgenic mice carrying the Mx - cre transgene ( Mx - cre + ) [ 25 ] . Deletion of the Rac1 gene was induced in 5 - to 6 - week - old ( Rac1 ( fl / fl ) / Mx - cre + ) mice ( 25 – 30 g body weight ) by two intraperitoneal injections of 200 μ g polyinosinic – polycytidylic acid ( pI - pC ) in a 2 - day interval . Control mice ( Rac1 ( fl / fl ) / Mx - cre - ) received the same treatment and were derived from the same litters . Ten days after the last injection , the mice were tested for successful knock out by Western blot analysis of platelet lysates . For experiments , mice were used at least 2 weeks after pI - pC injection . Reagents ADP , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , High Molecular Weight Heparin , ( all from Sigma , Deisen - hofen , Germany ) , α - thrombin ( Boehringer Mannheim , Germany ) , anti - Rac1 antibody ( BD Biosciences , Heidelberg , Germany ) , anti - mouse - IgG HRP ( DAKO A / S , Denmark ) , 1174 Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2009 ) 457 : 1173 – 1185 ECL - solution ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK ) , Apyrase Type III , NP - 40 , and polyinosinic – polycytidylic acid sodium ( Poly IC ; Amersham / GEHealthcare , Munich , Germany ) were purchased . Indomethacin was purchased via a local pharmacy . Collagen - related peptide ( CRP ) was generated as described [ 26 ] . The antibody against the activated form of integrin α IIb β 3 ( JON / A - PE ) was from Emfret Analytics ( Würzburg , Germany ) . All other antibodies were generated and modified in our laboratory as previously described [ 27 ] . Platelet preparation Mice were bled under ether anesthesia from the retroorbital plexus . Blood per mouse , 500 μ l , were collected in a tube containing 7 . 5 U / ml heparin , and platelet - rich plasma ( prp ) was obtained by centrifugation at 300× g for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) . For the preparation of washed platelets , prp was washed twice at 1 , 000 g for 8 min at room temperature , and the pellet was resuspended in modified Tyrode – HEPES ( N - 2 - hydroxyethyl - piperazone - N ′ 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ) buffer ( 134 mM NaCl , 0 . 34 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 . 9 mM KCL , 12 mM NaHCO 3 , 20 mM HEPES , 5 mM glucose , 0 . 35 % bovine serum albu - min , pH 6 . 6 ) in the presence of prostacyclin ( 0 . 1 μ g / ml ) and apyrase ( 0 . 02 U / ml ) . Platelets were finally resuspended in the same buffer without prostacyclin ( pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 02 U / ml apyrase ) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min before use . Aggregometry To determine platelet aggregation , light transmission was measured using prp or washed platelets ( 200 μ l with 0 . 5×10 6 platelets / μ l ) . Transmission was recorded on a Fibrintimer 4 channel aggregometer ( APACT Laborgeräte und Analysensysteme , Hamburg , Germany ) over 10 min and was expressed as arbitrary units with 100 % transmission adjusted with plasma . Platelet aggrega - tion was induced by addition of CRP , collagen , rhodocytin , U46619 , or ADP at the indicated concentrations . Thrombin - induced aggregation was performed with washed platelets ( 200 μ l with 0 . 5×10 6 platelets / μ l in Tyrode - HEPES buffer / 1 μ M CaCl 2 ) . Flow cytometry Fifty microliters blood were collected , washed twice in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and diluted 1 : 20 in Tyrode - HEPES buffer . Samples were activated with agonists at the indicated concentrations and stained with fluorophore - conjugated monoclonal antibodies at saturating concentrations for 10 min at 37°C . Samples were analyzed directly on a FACSCalibur ( BD Biosciences ) . Platelets were identified by FSC / SSC characteristics . Western blot analysis Washed platelets were lysed in 1 % NP - 40 for 10 min at 4°C , centrifuged , and supernatants were collected . An equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer was added , and the samples were boiled at 95°C for 5 min . Samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and trans - ferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane . After blocking , the membrane was first incubated with anti - Rac1 antibodies ( 1 μ g / ml ) for 1 h followed by extensive washing , and then for 1 h with anti - mouse IgG - HRP . An antibody against GPIIIa was used to control equal loading . After extensive washing , the protein was visualized by ECL . Adhesion under flow conditions Rectangular coverslips ( 24×60 mm ) were coated with 0 . 25 mg / ml fibrillar type I collagen ( Nycomed , Munich , Germany ) for 1 h at 37°C and blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . Perfusion of heparinized whole blood was performed as described [ 28 ] . Briefly , transparent flow chambers with a slit depth of 50 μ m , equipped with the collagen - coated coverslips , were rinsed with Tyrode – HEPES buffer and connected to a syringe filled with the anti - coagulated blood . Perfusion was carried out at room temperature using a pulse - free pump at low ( 150 s − 1 ) and high shear stress ( 1 , 000 s - 1 ) . During perfusion , microscopic phase - contrast images were real - time recorded . Thereafter , the chambers were rinsed by a 10 - min perfusion with Tyrode – HEPES buffer pH 7 . 45 at the same shear stress , and phase - contrast pictures were recorded from at least five different microscopic fields ( ×63 objectives ) . Image analysis was performed off - line using Metamorph software ( Visitron , Munich , Germany ) . Throm - bus formation results are expressed as the mean percentage of total area covered by thrombi . Intracellular calcium measurements Platelet intracellular calcium measurements were performed as described [ 29 ] . Briefly , platelets isolated from blood were washed , sus - pended in Tyrode ’ s buffer without calcium , and loaded with fura - 2 / AM ( 5 μ M ) in the presence of Pluronic F - 127 ( 0 . 2 μ g / ml ; Molecular Probes ) for 30 min at 37°C . After labeling , platelets were washed once and resuspended in Tyrode – HEPES buffer containing either no or 1 mM Ca 2 + . Stirred platelets were activated with agonists , and fluores - cence was measured with a PerkinElmer LS 55 fluorimeter . Excitation was alternated between 340 and 380 nm , and emission was measured at 509 nm . Each measurement was calibrated using Triton X - 100 and EGTA . Measurement of IP 1 The IP - One ELISA kit was from Cisbio ( Cedex , France ) . Washed murine platelets were adjusted to a concentration of 0 . 7×10 6 / μ l in a modified phosphate - free Tyrode – HEPES buffer containing 2 mM Ca 2 + and 50 mM LiCl 2 . Apyrase , indomethacin , and EDTA were added to a final concentration of 2 U / ml , 10 μ M , and 5 mM , respectively . Platelets were activated with the indicated agonists for 5 min at 37°C ( 350 rpm ) . After stimulation , platelets were lysed in the buffer supplied by Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2009 ) 457 : 1173 – 1185 1175 the kit . Fifty microliters of lysed platelets were used for the IP 1 ELISA assay according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Protein phosphorylation and immunoprecipitation For ty - rosine phosphorylation studies , equal amounts of platelets from WT and KO animals in suspension were stimulated with 2 . 5 μ g / ml convulxin under constant stirring conditions at 37°C . Stimulation was stopped by the addition of 1 : 1 ice - cold lysis buffer ( 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM TRIS , 2 mM EGTA , 2 mM EDTA , 2 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 2 % Igepal CA - 630 , 1 tablet Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( complete mini , Roche , Germany ) in 10 ml buffer , pH 7 . 5 ) . For whole - cell tyrosine - phosphorylation , Laemmli ’ s sample buffer was added ; samples were incubated at 95°C for 5 min and separated by SDS - PAGE on 4 – 12 % precast NuPage Bis – Tris gradient gels ( Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany ) under reducing conditions followed by transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane . For immunoprecipitation of individual proteins , following platelet lysis , samples were incubated with 2 μ g anti - PLC γ 2 antibody ( Q20 , Santa Cruz Biotechnologies , USA ) for 1 h at 4°C on a rotor . Samples were then incubated with Protein G - Sepharose at 4°C O / N . Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times in IP buffer ( 15 mM Tris – HCl , 155 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 005 % NaN 3 ) before being boiled in Laemmli ’ s sample buffer at 95°C for 5 min . Proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE on 4 – 12 % precast NuPage Bis – Tris gradient gels ( Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany ) under reducing condi - tions followed by transfer onto a PVDF membrane . Mem - branes were blocked for 1 h in 5 % BSA in PBS and then incubated with primary anti - phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 ( upstate , CA , USA ) for 1 h at RT . The membranes were then washed 4× 15 min in PBS - T before being incubated with secondary anti - mouse horseradish peroxidase - conjugated antibody in PBS - T . Following washing in PBS - T , the membranes were developed using an enhanced chemilumi - nescence detection system . For tyrosine phosphorylation studies of individual proteins , membranes were incubated for 35 min at 50°C in stripping buffer ( 62 . 5 mM Tris – HCl , 2 % SDS , 100 mM β - mercaptoethanol , pH 6 . 8 ) and reprobed with anti - PLC γ 2 antibody . Western blot was developed according to the procedure described above . Measurement of ATP release Washed platelets were adjusted to a concentration of 0 . 4×10 6 / μ l . Platelets were activated with the indicated agonists for 2 min at 37°C under stirring conditions ( 1 , 000 rpm ) . Following activation , EDTA ( 3 mM final concentration ) and formaldehyde ( 0 . 1 % final concen - tration ) were added , and platelets were fixed for 2 h . The platelets were then centrifuged for 1 min at 13 , 000 rpm and 100 μ l supernatant were added to 100 μ l absolute ethanol . Samples were stored at − 20°C until measuring . Levels of ATP in 12 . 5 - μ l samples were quantified using a biolumines - cence assay kit ( Roche Diagnostics , Germany ) and a Fluostar Optima luminometer ( BMG Lab technologies , Germany ) . Data analysis Results are shown as mean±SD from at least three individual experiments per group . Statistical analysis between wild - type and Rac1 − / − groups were assessed by the two - tailed Student ’ s t test . P values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Results Lack of functional Rac1 leads to embryonic lethality in mice [ 30 ] . Therefore , in order to study Rac1 function in platelets , mice carrying a Rac1 gene flanked by loxP sites [ 24 ] were crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the inducible interferone - sensitive Mx promoter [ 25 ] . Deletion of the Rac1 gene in Rac1 ( fl / fl cre + ) mice was induced by repeated injections of pI - pC which induces Cre expression in the hematopoietic system and leads to efficient gene deletion in megakaryocytes and , consequently , protein deficiency in platelets [ 28 , 31 ] . Rac1 ( fl / fl ) mice not carrying Mx – Cre were used as wild - type controls . Ten days after the last injection , the absence of Rac1 in platelets from Rac1 ( fl / fl cre + ) mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates ( Fig . 1a ) using GPIIIa levels as loading control . Deletion of Rac1 had no significant effect on peripheral platelet counts ( Fig . 1b ) or the expression of prominent surface receptors including integrins α IIb β 3 and α 2 β 1 as well as GPIb and GPVI ( Table 1 ) . These results confirmed that Rac1 is not essential for megakaryocyte development and platelet production . Furthermore , in accordance with the proposed function of Rac1 [ 16 ] , Rac1 − / − platelets failed to form lamellipodia and to spread on a fibrinogen surface upon thrombin stimulation , but retained the ability to adhere and form filopodia , confirming recent results from McCarty and coworkers [ 17 ] ( Fig . 1c ) . Rac1 − / − platelets show diminished responses to GPVI and CLEC - 2 stimulation The response of Rac1 − / − platelets to different agonists was tested by standard aggregometry . In response to thrombin , ADP , and the stable TxA 2 analog U46619 , Rac1 − / − platelets aggregated normally at all tested concentrations ( Fig . 1d , g ) , although a slightly faster reversion of ADP - induced aggregation was consistently observed with mutant platelets compared to the wild - type controls . In contrast , Rac1 − / − platelets showed a clear reduction in their reactivity towards collagen which was most evident at low and intermediate concentrations of the agonist ( Fig . 1e , g ) . Since platelet activation by collagen is mediated by GPVI , 1176 Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2009 ) 457 : 1173 – 1185 we next tested the possible defect in this signaling pathway by the GPVI - specific agonist collagen - related peptide ( CRP ) and also found a markedly reduced reactivity response that was most evident at low and intermediate concentrations ( Fig . 1e , g ) . Interestingly , RC - induced aggre - gation was also impaired at low and intermediate concen - trations , suggesting defective signaling downstream of CLEC - 2 [ 6 , 32 ] ( Fig . 1f , g ) . f t r a n s m i ss i on ( % ) rhodocytin [ µ g / ml ] 0 . 24 0 . 48 0 50 25 0 20 40 60 80 a gg r e g a t i on ( % ) * * * * * * * * * 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 10 1 0 . 24 thr [ U / ml ] ADP CRP coll [ µ g / ml ] RC U46 [ µ M ] a - / - + / + t r a n s m i ss i on ( % ) CRP [ µ g / ml ] 0 . 1 0 . 2 1 0 . 05 0 . 01 time 0 50 25 75 collagen [ µ g / ml ] 3 1 10 5 0 . 2 0 50 25 75 WT Rac1 - / - P l a t e l e t s / µ l [ 10 - 3 ] 0 400 800 1200 b d ADP [ µ M ] thrombin [ U / ml ] 0 . 02 0 . 2 U46619 [ µ M ] 10 0 . 3 3 t r a n s m i ss i on ( % ) 0 50 25 0 50 25 time c time 1 5 min e g prp washedplatelets prp prp 5 min 5 min Rac1 - / - WT Rac1 GPIIIa Rac1 - / - WT Fig . 1 Rac1 − / − platelets show impaired aggregation responses to GPVI agonists . a Western blot analysis of Rac1 expression in wild - type and Rac1 − / − platelets 10 days after the first polyIC injection .

Light transmission was recorded on a Fibrintimer 4 channel aggregometer over 10 min and is expressed as arbitrary units with 100 % transmission adjusted with plasma . The experiments were performed in the presence of 70 μ g / ml human fibrinogen . Thrombin stimulation was done in the absence of human fibrinogen . The results shown are representative of 9 – 15 individual experiments . g Bar graphs of results obtained by aggregometry . Results are given as the mean percent of aggregation±SD Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2009 ) 457 : 1173 – 1185 1177 It is well known that under conditions of standard aggregometry , aggregation in response to collagen , and to a lower extent also to CRP , is amplified by released mediators , such as ADP and TxA 2 , making it difficult to directly assess defects in individual signaling pathways . Therefore , platelets were preincubated with apyrase ( 2 U / ml ) and indomethacin ( 10 μ M ) to prevent the effects of these mediators and then stimulated with high concentrations of collagen ( 20 μ g / ml ) or CRP ( 10 μ g / ml ) . Under these conditions , wild - type but not Rac1 − / − platelets were able to aggregate , strongly indicating a selective GPVI signal - ing defect in the absence of Rac1 ( Fig . 2 ) . This was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of single platelets in diluted suspensions , i . e . , under experimental conditions that largely exclude the accumulation of released mediators [ 33 , 34 ] . Washed platelets were stimulated with increasing concentrations of CRP , RC , thrombin , and ADP and the activation of integrin α IIb β 3 ( JON / A - PE [ 35 ] ) as well as degranulation - dependent surface exposure of P - selectin was determined . Equally strong α IIb β 3 activation was observed in control and Rac1 − / − platelets in response to thrombin and ADP ( Fig . 3a , c ) . Likewise , thrombin - induced P - selectin expression was indistinguishable between the two groups at all tested concentrations ( Fig . 3b , c ) , whereas ADP , as expected , failed to induce significant P - selectin expression . In contrast , the response of Rac1 − / − platelets to CRP or the GPVI - activating snake venom protein convulxin ( CVX ) was virtually abolished , even at very high concen - trations of the agonists . Similarly , α IIb β 3 activation and P - selectin expression were dramatically impaired in response to RC in Rac1 − / − platelets . This selective secretion defect was also confirmed when ATP release was determined . Thrombin - induced comparable ATP release in control and Rac1 − / − platelets ( 1 . 7±0 . 5 μ M vs . 1 . 5±0 . 5 μ M ) , whereas CRP - or CVX - induced ATP release was minimal in the mutant cells ( Fig . 3d ) . Together , these results demonstrate a pronounced defect in Rac1 − / − platelets in the ITAM and ITAM - like signaling pathways mediated by GPVI and CLEC - 2 , respectively , but normal responses to G - protein coupled agonists . Defective PLC γ 2 activation and Ca 2 + mobilization in Rac1 − / − platelets The above results suggested that Rac1 might be directly involved in ITAM / ITAM - like signaling upstream of Ca 2 + mobilization and PKC activation as these processes are obviously functional downstream of Gq - coupled agonists .

Mean platelet size ( mean FSC ) was determined by FSC characteristics . 1178 Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2009 ) 457 : 1173 – 1185 response to thrombin and CRP . As shown in Fig . 4a and b , intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization in response to CRP was significantly reduced in Rac1 − / − platelets compared to controls as determined in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 + . As a direct consequence , the subsequent Ca 2 + entry was also dramatically diminished in the mutant cells . In contrast , unaltered Ca 2 + mobilization and entry was seen in response to thrombin stimulation . These results suggested that Rac1 may be required for efficient activation of PLC γ 2 , but not PLC β . To test this more directly , we analysed PLC γ 2 activity by indirect measurement of inositol trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) using an IP 1 ELISA . The IP 3 lifetime within the cell is very short ( less than 30 s ) before it is transformed into IP 2 and IP 1 . IP 1 can accumulate in the cell after addition of Li + which inhibits its degradation to myo - inositol . Therefore , we quantified IP 1 after platelet activation with thrombin ( 1 U / ml ) or CVX ( 1 μ g / ml ) in the presence of apyrase ( 2 U / ml ) and indomethacin ( 10 μ M ) . While thrombin - induced IP 1 production was comparable in control and Rac1 − / − platelets , the response to CVX was markedly reduced in the mutant cells compared to controls ( 137± 17 nM vs . 418±37 . 1 nM , n = 3 , P < 0 . 001 ) , indicating that the activity of PLC γ 2 is indeed affected in the absence of Rac1 ( Fig . 4c ) . The PLC γ 2 activation defect was not based on reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme in response to GPVI stimulation as shown by whole cell tyrosine phosphorylation experiments , where the CVX - induced changes were indistinguishable between control and Rac1 − / − platelets , including strong phosphorylation of a protein that migrated at the known position of PLC γ 2 M F I ( J O N / A - PE ) 3 activation M F I ( a n t i P - se l ec t i n - F I T C ) II b 3 ac t i va t i on surface P - selectin CRP ( 10 µg / ml ) thrombin ( 0 . 1 U / ml ) resting a b c d P - selectin expression 0 200 400 600 800 - 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 1 thrombin [ U / ml ] 10 ADP [ µM ] CVX 10 CRP [ µg / ml ] 1 RC 0 50 100 150 200 250 - 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 1 thrombin [ U / ml ] 10 ADP [ µM ] CVX 10 CRP [ µg / ml ] 1 RC * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 - 0 . 1 1 thrombin [ U / ml ] 10 [ µg / ml ] CRP CVX A T P ( µ M ) * * * * * - / - + / + α β IIb α β Fig . 3 Defective α IIb β 3 activation and granule secretion in Rac1 − / − platelets in response to GPVI and CLEC - 2 stimulation .

This was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments , which yielded compara - ble increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC γ 2 in control and mutant platelets ( Fig . 4e ) . To test a possible involvement of Rac1 in the GPVI signaling cascade downstream of PLC γ 2 , but independent of Ca 2 + mobilization , we assessed protein kinase C ( PKC ) - dependent activation . For this , we stimulated control and Rac1 − / − platelets with the DAG analog PMA and found no differences in aggregation , integrin α IIb β 3 activation , or P - selectin exposure ( data not shown ) , suggesting that Rac1 is not required for PKC - mediated activation processes in platelets . Defective adhesion and aggregation of Rac1 − / − platelets on collagen under flow To test the functional consequences of Rac1 - deficiency under more physiological conditions , we analyzed platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on a collagen - coated a 200 400 600 800 1000 [ C a 2 + ] i c ( n M ) 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 80 160 240 0 80 160 240 1 mM Ca 2 + thrombin CRP 20 40 60 80 100 120 20 40 60 80 100 120 5 mM EGTA thrombin CRP Time [ sec ] b 1 mM Ca 2 + 400 800 1200 1600 0 100 200 300 40 80 120 5 mM EGTA 0 20 40 60 thrombin thrombin CRP CRP [ C a 2 + ] i c ( n M ) * * * c 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 - 1 1 thrombin [ U / ml ] [ µg / ml ] CVX I P 1 c on c ( n M ) - / - + / + * * * d WT Rac1 - / - 0 30 60 120 ( kDa ) 97 64 51 39 28 whole cell lysate ( sec ) e ( sec ) IP : PLC 2 0 30 90 Blot : anti - pTyr Blot : anti - PLC 2 WT 0 30 90 Rac1 - / - 0 30 60 120 Y Y Fig . 4 Defective GPVI - induced PLC γ 2 activation in Rac1 − / − platelets . a Time course of intracellular calcium mobilization in wild - type ( black curve ) and Rac1 − / − platelets ( gray curve ) in response to CRP and thrombin .

Results are given as the mean IP 1 concentration ( nM ) ±SD ( n = 3 per group ) . d Determination of tyrosine phosphorylation . Washed platelets from wild - type and Rac1 − / − mice were stimulated with 1 μ g / ml CVX under stirring conditions ( 1 , 000 rpm ) at 37°C . Fifty - microliter aliquots were taken at the indicated time points . Samples were blotted on a PVDF membrane and stained using an antibody against phosphorylated tyrosine . The result shown is representative for three individual experiments . e Immunoprecipitation using a PLC γ 2 - specific antibody . Washed platelets from wild - type and Rac1 − / − mice were stimulated as indicated above . Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4°C ; precipi - tates were blotted on a PVDF membrane and stained using an antibody specific for phosphorylated tyrosine ( upper panel ) and an antibody against PLC γ 2 ( lower panel ) . The result shown is representative for three individual experiments 1180 Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2009 ) 457 : 1173 – 1185 surface under flow in a whole - blood perfusion system [ 36 ] . Under both high ( 1 , 000 s − 1 , 4 min ) and low ( 150 s − 1 , 10 min ) shear conditions , wild - type platelets rapidly adhered to the collagen surface and recruited additional platelets from the blood stream resulting in the formation of stable three - dimensional thrombi ( Fig . 5a , left ) . In sharp contrast , adhesion of Rac1 − / − platelets was significantly reduced compared to the control , and the formation of stable three - dimensional thrombi was virtually abrogated . As a result , the surface area covered by platelets at the end of the perfusion period was markedly reduced for Rac1 − / − blood compared to the wild type and consisted almost completely of a single platelet layer ( Fig . 5b ) . These results demonstrated that Rac1 is essential for the formation of stable three - dimensional platelet thrombi on collagen under flow conditions . This is in line with a recent study by McCarty et al . who made similar obser - vations but attributed this defect mainly to the important function of Rac1 in the agonist - induced reorganization of the cytoskeleton leading to lamellipodia formation and spreading [ 17 ] . In contrast to this hypothesis , our data indicated that the defect in GPVI - induced activation and release of ADP and TxA 2 could also be responsible for the inability to form three - dimensional thrombi . To discrimi - nate between these two possibilities , we tested whether thrombus formation of Rac1 − / − platelets could be restored by exogenously adding the “ missing ” secondarily acting agonists . For this , ADP and U46619 were co - infused into Rac1 − / − blood directly before it entered the flow chamber [ 37 ] . Under these experimental conditions , large thrombi formed within 2 min under high ( Fig . 5a right , b ) and low ( not shown ) shear conditions . These thrombi were stable and did not detach from the collagen - coated surface or shed emboli , demonstrating that Rac1 − / − platelets can adhere and form shear - resistant thrombi on collagen when stimulated appropriately . These results suggest that the defect in GPVI - dependent cellular activation rather than the inability to form lamellipodia is the major cause for the markedly reduced thrombus stability observed with Rac1 − / − platelets . 150 s - 1 1000 s - 1 WT Rac1 - / - no agonist ADP + U46619 0 20 40 60 80 100 s u r f ace c o ve r a g e [ % ] 150 s - 1 + / + - / - 1000 s - 1 - - ADP / U4661 9 a b * * * * * * Fig . 5 Impaired adhesion and defective thrombus formation of Rac1 − / − platelets on collagen under flow .

Where indicated , 10 μ M ADP and 1 μ M U46619 were co - infused into the blood shortly before it entered the flow chamber . a Representative phase contrast images and b surface area covered by platelets ±SD ( n = 6 per group ) taken at the end of the perfusion time Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2009 ) 457 : 1173 – 1185 1181 Defective arterial thrombus formation in Rac1 − / − mice in vivo The above - described experiments indicated that Rac1 deficiency results in a marked GPVI signaling defect and an inability of the platelets to spread on different substrates . To test the significance of this defect in arterial thrombus formation in vivo , two different well - established thrombo - sis models were used . In the first model , platelet adhesion at the injured carotid artery was analyzed by in vivo fluorescence microscopy . This model allows the visualiza - tion and quantitation of platelet adhesion on the exposed subendothelial matrix which has been shown to be a largely GPVI - dependent process [ 38 ] . Platelets purified from donor mice of the same genotype were fluorescently labeled and injected into recipient mice . Vascular injury was induced by vigorous ligation of the carotid artery , a process that consistently causes disruption of the endothelial layer and frequent breaching of the internal elastic lamina , followed by rapid collagen - dependent platelet adhesion and aggre - gate formation . In wild - type mice , numerous platelets adhered to the site of injury within the first minutes after injury , and virtually all platelets establishing an initial contact with the subendothelium remained firmly adherent ( 2 , 579±218 / mm 2 , t = 5 min ; Fig . 6a , b ) . In contrast , in Rac1 − / − mice , the number of adherent platelets was reduced by 57 % compared to the control ( 1 , 120 . 7±74 . 6 / mm 2 , t = 5 min ) . An even more pronounced reduction in adhesion was observed in mice , in which GPVI had been depleted by treatment with the anti - GPVI antibody JAQ1 [ 39 ] ( 362 . 7± 42 / mm 2 , t = 5 min ) , which served as a positive control . These results confirmed the importance of GPVI - collagen interactions for platelet recruitment in this arterial injury model and revealed a central role of Rac1 in this process . The significance of Rac1 for arterial thrombus formation was confirmed in a second model , where injury is mechanically induced in the aorta , and blood flow is monitored with an ultrasonic perivascular Doppler flow meter . After a transient increase directly after injury , blood flow progressively decreased for several minutes in all animals . In all wild - type mice ( seven out of seven ) , this decrease resulted in complete and irreversible occlusion of the vessel within maximally 7 min thereafter ( mean occlusion time 3 . 0±2 . 3 min , Fig . 6c , d ) . In sharp contrast , while a progressive reduction in blood flow was observed during the first minutes after injury in Rac1 − / − mice , blood flow increased again to normal and seven of eight mice displayed essentially normal flow rates through the injured 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 WT Rac1 - / - GPVI depl . p l a t e l e t s / mm 2 WT Rac1 - / - GPVI depl . a b c d 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 time after injury [ min ] b l ood f l o w [ m l / m i n ] WT Rac1 - / - 0 10 20 30 40 WT Rac1 - / - t i m e t o o cc l u s i on [ s ] b l ee d i ng t i m e [ s ] WT Rac1 - / - 0 400 800 1200 > 1200 e 0 600 1200 1800 > 1800 Fig . 6 Rac1 − / − mice display a severe adhesion defect in vivo and do not form stable thrombi . a Platelet adhesion to the carotid artery 5 min after injury .

Each symbol represents one individual 1182 Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2009 ) 457 : 1173 – 1185 vessel at the end of the observation period ( 45 min ) . Similar results were obtained with GPVI - depleted mice ( not shown ) , confirming earlier results [ 40 ] . In agreement with the reduced thrombotic activity in Rac1 − / − mice , these animals also exhibited prolonged bleeding times ( Fig . 6e ) . Notably , bleeding times were highly variable suggesting thrombus instability as recently also described for mice lacking the α 2A adrenergic receptor [ 41 ] . Discussion Our results reveal that the small GTPase Rac1 is required for ITAM - dependent activation of PLC γ 2 in platelets . Deficiency in Rac1 resulted in defective GPVI - induced calcium mobilization and entry leading to severely defec - tive adhesion and thrombus formation on collagen in vitro and at the injured vessel wall in vivo . In addition , we have shown that Rac1 is involved in platelet activation through CLEC - 2 which employs a similar signaling pathway as GPVI involving Src family kinases , Syk , and PLC γ 2 [ 6 , 32 ] and thus represents an “ ITAM - like ” pathway . On the other hand , Rac1 − / − platelets show unaltered Ca 2 + mobili - zation and cellular activation in response to GPCR activation , suggesting that the GTPase is not involved in PLC β activation in platelets . This stands in contrast to results by Akbar and co - workers who reported a pro - nounced secretion defect in response to all tested agonists in Rac1 - deficient mouse platelets and human platelets treated with a selective Rac1 inhibitor [ 22 ] . In line with our results , McCarty et al . also found unaltered secretion and aggregation of Rac1 - deficient platelets in response to GPCR - coupled agonists [ 17 ] . We cannot explain the discrepancies in the results , but they may be due to different experimental conditions . Despite the severe defect in GPVI - induced cellular activation , no significant alterations in tyrosine phosphory - lation patterns were detectable in the absence of Rac1 ( Fig . 4d ) . Importantly , also GPVI - induced PLC γ 2 phos - phorylation was indistinguishable between wild - type and Rac1 − / − platelets . However , GPVI - induced IP 3 production and Ca 2 + mobilization were severely impaired in the mutant platelets ( Fig . 4a – c ) . This clearly shows that Rac1 acts as a co - activator of PLC γ 2 in platelets that regulates the enzyme independently of tyrosine phosphorylation events in murine platelets and it will be important to confirm this result in human platelets . Such a mechanism has recently been proposed by Piechulek et al . based on data obtained in heterologous cells and cell - free systems [ 13 ] . They showed that PLC γ 2 activation induced by constitutively active Rac1 was independent of phosphorylation of tyrosine residues known to be modified by PLC γ 2 - activating protein - tyrosine kinases . Inactivation of Rac1 by Clostridium sordelii lethal toxin provoked inhibition of intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization . The modality of interaction of Rac1 with PLC γ 2 and the involved mechanisms are not clear at present . Piechulek et al . propose a direct interaction of activated Rac1 with one of the PH domains of PLC γ 2 as it was shown for PLC γ 1 where a split PH domain is known to be responsible for protein – protein interactions [ 42 , 43 ] . Further studies will be required to address this important question . We found impaired aggregation of Rac1 − / − platelets to low and intermediate concentrations of collagen and CRP , whereas largely normal responses were observed at high agonist concentrations ( Fig . 1 ) . However , these aggrego - metric studies had underestimated the severity of the defect in GPVI - dependent activation as flow cytometric analysis revealed a dramatic impairment of cellular activation even at very high agonist concentrations ( Fig . 3a – c ) . Moreover , granule secretion , as determined by measuring released ATP , was almost abolished in Rac1 − / − platelets upon induction of GPVI signaling ( Fig . 3d ) . It is known that in standard aggregometry , robust platelet aggregation can be achieved even under conditions of very weak integrin α IIb β 3 activation [ 33 , 44 ] . In addition , released secondary mediators such as ADP and TxA 2 accumulate in the aggregometer cuvette and to a great extent induce / amplify the observed aggregation response . Both of these factors probably contributed to the aggregation of Rac1 − / − platelets in response to high collagen or CRP concentrations . This notion is supported by the finding that Rac1 − / − platelets were unable to aggregate in response to high concentrations of collagen or CRP under conditions excluding the contribution of ADP and TxA 2 ( Fig . 2 ) . Similar to McCarty et al . , we found reduced adhesion of Rac1 − / − platelets to collagen and virtually abrogated thrombus formation ( Fig . 5 ) . However , these authors proposed this aggregate instability to be based on altered cytoskeletal regulation leading to unstable aggregate for - mation [ 17 ] . Although the defect in lamellipodia formation could also be confirmed in the current study ( Fig . 1c ) , this does most likely not account for the observed thrombus instability since co - infusion of ADP and U46619 to the flow system fully restored the ability of Rac1 − / − platelets to form large stable three - dimensional thrombi that did not detach from the collagen - coated surface ( Fig . 5a ) . This surprising finding demonstrates that lamellipodia formation is not required for thrombus stability , at least under the here - described experimental conditions . Rather , the data suggest that the observed defect is based on insufficient GPVI - mediated platelet activation and release of second - arily acting agonists . In fact , the adhesion and thrombus formation defect observed in Rac1 − / − mice is very similar to that previously seen in PLC γ 2 − / − mice [ 45 ] . Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol ( 2009 ) 457 : 1173 – 1185 1183 GPVI has been established as an attractive antithrom - botic target [ 38 , 39 ] also making its downstream signaling cascade interesting for inhibition . In addition , the strong cellular activation induced by CLEC - 2 indicates that the receptor may be involved in platelet activation at sites of injury . The ligand to trigger this response has not yet been identified , but recent studies have shown that podoplanin , a transmembrane sialoglycoprotein expressed in a variety of cells , including tumor cells , activates platelets through CLEC - 2 strongly suggesting that this process contributes to hematogenous metastasis [ 46 ] . Therefore , the pathway involving Rac1 downstream of GPVI and CLEC - 2 might be an attractive target for new anti - platelet agents to prevent thrombosis but also other pathological processes such as tumor metastasis . This is also confirmed by the protection of Rac1 - deficient mice from arterial thrombosis ( Fig . 6 ) . Thus , inhibitors of Rac1 [ 47 ] might be effective in the prophylaxis or treatment of ischemic cerebro - or cardiovas - cular diseases .
