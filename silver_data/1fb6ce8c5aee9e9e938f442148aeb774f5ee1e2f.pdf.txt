To uncover DNA methylation changes critical for WT pathogenesis , we compared the epigenome of fetal kidney with two WT cell lines , using methyl - CpG immunoprecipitation . We filtered our results to remove common cancer - associated epigenetic changes , and to enrich for genes involved in early kidney development . This identified four candidate genes that were hypermethylated in WT cell lines compared to fetal kidney , of which ESRP2 ( epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 ) , was the most promising gene for further study . ESRP2 was commonly repressed by DNA methylation early in WT development ( in nephrogenic rests ) and could be reactivated by DNA methyltransferase inhibition in WT cell lines . When ESRP2 was expressed in WT cell lines , it acted as an inhibitor of cellular proliferation in vitro and in vivo it suppressed tumour growth of orthotopic xenografts in nude mice . RNA - seq of the ESRP2 - expressing WT cell lines identified several novel splicing targets , in addition to well - characterised targets of ESRP2 . One of these targets , LEF1 , is a component of the Wnt signalling pathway that is essential for kidney development and commonly disrupted in WT . We propose a model in which the Wnt pathway can be disrupted in early kidney development to generate WT , either by genetic abnormalities such as WT1 mutations , or by epigenetic defects , such as ESRP2 methylation . 6 INTRODUCTION Wilms tumour ( WT ; nephroblastoma ) is an embryonal kidney cancer , affecting approximately 1 in 10 , 000 children ( 1 , 2 ) . It originates from fetal kidney , due to the failure of the mesenchymal to epithelial transition ( MET ) that the metanephric blastema undergoes during normal renal development . The metanephric blastema differentiates to form both epithelial and stromal components in the developing kidney . In WT , most tumours retain some of this differentiation potential , giving a so - called “triphasic” histology , with blastemal , epithelial , and stromal elements are all present in varying degrees ( 3 ) . Premalignant lesions , known as nephrogenic rests ( NRs ) , are associated with many WTs ( 4 ) . NRs are usually microscopic lesions , seen in the normal kidney adjacent to WTs , and contain undifferentiated fetal kidney cells ( 4 ) . It is hypothesised that genetic and epigenetic defects occur during renal development that block MET , leading to the formation of NRs , some of which eventually progress to WT ( 3 , 4 ) . The molecular events underlying WT pathogenesis involve an array of genetic and epigenetic defects ( 1 - 3 ) . The earliest genetic mutations associated with WT were found in the WT1 gene , which was discovered due to its association with several WT - predisposing syndromes . WT1 is essential for normal kidney development , where it plays a critical role in regulating MET ( 3 , 5 ) . Another critical pathway in renal development is the Wnt pathway ( 3 ) , and mutations in Wnt pathway components such as CTNNB1 ( 6 , 7 ) and WTX ( AMER1 ) ( 8 ) have also been found in WT . Recent genome - wide sequencing studies have identified mutations in microRNA - processing genes , such as DROSHA , DICER and DGCR8 , as well as mutations in other renal developmental regulators , including SIX1 , SIX2 and SALL1 ( 9 - 14 ) . Most of these events do not show a strong association with clinical outcome , but TP53 mutations are found in the rare anaplastic variant of WT , which has a much poorer prognosis than other subtypes ( 15 ) . Epigenetic alterations are also a common feature of WT ( 16 ) , especially at the 11p15 locus , where the frequent loss of imprinting ( LOI ) of the fetal growth factor gene IGF2 ( 17 , 18 ) is 7 associated with DNA methylation changes at the H19 DMR ( 19 , 20 ) . We have also reported recurrent LOI at 11p13 involving imprinted WT1 transcripts ( WT1 - AS / AWT1 ) ( 21 , 22 ) . Other epigenetic alterations in WT include global hypomethylation ( 23 ) , DNA hypermethylation at individual tumour suppressor genes such as RASSF1A ( 23 - 25 ) , and long - range epigenetic silencing of the PCDHG @ gene clusters ( 26 ) . Despite the large number of individual loci identified as bearing genetic and / or epigenetic lesions in WT , a proportion of WTs still lack identifiable driver mutations or epimutations , implying that there are additional novel genes involved in WT pathogenesis ( 14 ) . We have used genome - wide DNA methylation analysis of WT to identify novel epigenetic lesions , which previously led to the discovery of the first example of long - range epigenetic silencing in WT ( 26 ) . In this paper we report on further studies in which we have compared two WT cell lines to fetal kidney , to identify additional DNA methylation changes in WT . One of these novel genes , the alternative splicing regulator ESRP2 ( epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 ) , is known to be important in epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( EMT ) and MET ( 27 ) , suggesting that epigenetic deregulation of MET may be an important factor in WT development . We show that ESRP2 is frequently silenced by DNA hypermethylation in WT , and that it acts as a tumour suppressor gene , regulating alternative splicing in novel genes , some of which affect pathways known to be important in kidney development . 8 MATERIALS AND METHODS Data availability MCIP data have been deposited in NCBI ' s Gene Expression Omnibus ( 5 ) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE153047 : https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / query / acc . cgi ? acc = GSE153047 .

Ethical statement Wilms tumour samples were obtained from Bristol Children’s hospital ( BCH ) , or from collaborators at the Royal Marsden Hospital ( RMH ) , as part of a UK collaboration . Samples were obtained with informed consent ( from parent and / or legal guardian for children less than 18 years of age ) and with appropriate ethical approval ( E5797 , South West – Central Bristol Research Ethics Committee ( UK ) ) . All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations , including those specified in the UK Human Tissue Act 2004 . All animal experiments and procedures were approved by the UK Home Office in accordance with the Animals ( Scientific Procedures ) Act 1986 . Mice were maintained at the Biological Services Unit , University of Exeter , UK . Cell lines The Wit49 WT cell line ( 28 ) was a kind gift from Prof . Herman Yeger ( The Hospital for Sick Children , Ontario , Canada ) and 17 . 94 was derived in the author’s laboratory ( 29 ) . Cell line identity was confirmed by short tandem repeat ( STR ) analysis ( supplementary figure S1 ) . 9 WT cell lines and 293 adenovirus - transformed fetal kidney cells ( 30 ) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , 0 . 1 mg / ml streptomycin and 2mM L - glutamine , at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . The V200 and E200L cells lines were derived from Wit49 by transfecting 2x10 5 cells with 200 µg of an inducible expression vector , pBIG2r ( 31 ) , either empty ( V200 ) or containing an ESRP2 cDNA insert ( E200L ) . ESRP2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from IMAGE clone 4810948 , using a forward primer containing a BamHI site and a reverse primer containing an EcoRV site plus a FLAG tag ( supplementary table S9 ) , then ligated into BamHI / EcoRV - digested pBIG2r ( supplementary figure S2A ) . Only the ESRP2 - transfected Wit49 cells ( E200L ) expressed vector - derived ESRP2 RNA ( supplementary figure S2B ) . Transfected cells were selected and maintained in 50 µg / ml hygromycin B ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . ESRP2 expression was induced by addition of 2 - 5 µg / ml doxycycline ( Dox , Sigma ) , with maximum ESRP2 protein expression at 72 to 96 hrs post - induction ( supplementary figure S2C ) . Cell growth assays For mass culture assays , cells were seeded into 6 well plates ( 1x10 6 cells per well ) and treated with 2 µg / ml Dox or DMSO vehicle control , with medium changes every 3 days . Cells were trypsinised and counted at days 3 , 6 and 8 using a Countess cell counter and trypan blue stain to exclude dead cells . For colony assays , cells were seeded into 6 well plates ( 2x10 5 cells per well ) and treated with 2 µg / ml Dox or DMSO vehicle control . Medium was changed every 3 days , then at 14 days cells were fixed , stained with methylene blue and colonies counted manually . To monitor proliferation in real time , cells were seeded in a 24 - well plate at 5x10 3 cells per well , in quadruplicates , and transferred to the IncuCyte ZOOM live cell imaging system 10 ( Essen BioScience ) . Images were taken in four different fields in each well , every two hours and phase confluence was calculated as a surrogate for growth at each time point . Transwell assay Cells were pre - treated for 4 days with 2 µg / ml Dox or control media , then 2x10 5 cells were seeded per well ( re - suspended in FBS - free DMEM ) into a 6 well plate transwell insert ( 8 µm pore , PET membrane ; Falcon , 353093 ) in a 6 - well plate . Wells were filled with 1 . 7 ml 10 % FBS in DMEM to produce a chemotactic gradient . Following 24 hours , inserts were washed and cells on underside of membrane were fixed and stained with crystal violet . Migrated ( stained ) cells were counted manually using light microscopy . Scratch assay 7 . 5x10 5 cells were seeded per well in 24 well plates . Cells were treated for 5 days with 2 µg / ml Dox or control media prior to a scratch being performed manually in the centre of the well using a p200 Gilson pipette tip . Wells were washed gently with PBS to remove dead cells from scratch wound site . Control / Dox media was replaced , and wells were analysed at 24 and 48 hours via widefield microscopy and Image J software was used to determine percentage wound closure . Cell Trace Violet ( CTV ) proliferation assay CTV ( ThermoFisher ; C34571 ) was prepared in DMSO and diluted in PBS according to manufacturer’s instructions . 1 ml of diluted CTV stain was used per 1x10 6 cells . Cells were incubated for 20 minutes at 37 o C in the dark before staining was quenched using 10 % FBS in DMEM . Stained cells were subsequently seeded into T12 . 5 flasks . Controls were prepared at this point via fixing 3x10 5 stained cells in 1 % paraformaldehyde . These cells 11 were stored at 4 o C , protected from light until the day of the assay . Seeded cells in T12 . 5 flasks were treated for 6 days with 2 µg / ml Dox or control media . On day 6 , intensity of CTV staining was analysed using a Novocyte flow cytometer and FlowJo software . 5 - Aza - 2’ - deoxycytidine treatment Cells were incubated in medium containing 2µM 5 - aza - 2’ - deoxycytidine ( azadC ; Sigma ) for up to 6 days , with a medium change every two days . Control cultures received equivalent volumes of drug solvent ( DMSO ) . Xenografting into nude mice The Wit49 derivatives V200 and E200L were transduced with lentivral particles expressing firefly luciferase ( Amsbio LVP326 ) , then successfully transduced cells were selected with blasticidin , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . For orthotopic kidney implantation , an incision was performed in the left flank of the mice , the left kidney was exteriorised and 2x10 6 cells were injected . Mice were imaged twice weekly using a Xenogen IVIS device , following intraperitoneal injection with luciferin . Once the tumour signal was apparent , mice were injected intraperitoneally with Doxycycline three times per week ( 50 mg / kg in 5 % glucose ) . Mice were culled either when tumours grew to the maximum allowed size of 10mm in diameter according to the animal licence or after two months of imaging . Dissected tumours were analysed by Western Blot for the induction of ESRP2 . DNA extraction and methyl CpG immunoprecipitation ( MCIP ) DNA was extracted from WT cell lines with a DNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) . Human fetal kidney DNA was obtained from BioChain . MCIP was performed as described previously ( 32 ) by co - hybridising methylation - enriched DNA fractions with input DNA on to a custom microarray 12 ( Nimblegen ) , based on design 2006 - 04 - 28 _ HG18 _ Refseq _ Promoter ( see GEO entry for further details ) . Statistical analyses by ChIPMonk software ( http : / / www . bioinformatics . bbsrc . ac . uk / projects / chipmonk ) , used windowed T - tests to identify differentially methylated genes ( supplementary table S1 ) . log2 gene methylation levels were derived from the mean probe ratios within 700bp of the transcriptional start site . The MCIP data have been deposited in NCBI ' s Gene Expression Omnibus ( 5 ) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE153047 : https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / query / acc . cgi ? acc = GSE153047 . Pyrosequencing DNA was purified by phenol - chloroform extraction , bisulfite converted ( EZ DNA Methylation Gold kit ; Zymo Research ) , amplified using a Pyromark PCR kit ( Qiagen ) and pyrosequenced on a PyroMark Q96 instrument ( Qiagen ) , using primers listed in supplementary table S10 . RNA extraction , cDNA synthesis and RT - PCR Total RNA was extracted using TriReagent ( Sigma ) and DNase treated with TURBO DNA - free ( Ambion ) . Human fetal kidney RNA was obtained from BioChain . cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript IV RT - PCR system ( Invitrogen ) . Gene - specific primers ( supplementary table S9 ) were used for end - point PCR ( HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase ; Qiagen ) , to detect different sized amplicons on agarose gels ( 1 . 5 % ) , representing inclusion or exclusion of alternative exons . Quantitative real - time PCR ( QPCR ) using gene - specific primers ( supplementary table S9 ) was performed using QuantiNova SYBR Green mix ( Qiagen ) on an MX3000P real - time PCR machine ( Stratagene ) , normalising the amount of target gene to the endogenous level of TBP . Human universal RNA ( Agilent ) was used as a reference to standardise results between QPCR batches . 13 Protein extraction and Western Blotting Cells were washed with ice - cold PBS and lysed in cell lysis buffer ( Cell Signaling ) , with complete mini inhibitors ( Roche ) for 10 min on ice , and then sonicated for 5 min at high intermittent pulses ( 30 / 30 ) ( Diagenode , Bioruptor ) . Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 , 000 g at 4°C to remove any cell debris and typically 25 µg proteins were separated on SDS - polyacrylamide gels and analysed by Western blotting . Primary antibodies were against ESRP2 ( rabbit , Abcam ab155227 ) , FLAG ( mouse , Sigma F3165 ) and β - ACTIN ( rabbit , Abcam AB8227 ) , followed by secondary HRP - labelled anti - rabbit IgG ( Sigma A6154 ) or anti - mouse IgG ( Sigma A9044 ) . Chemiluminescence detection was with Lumiglo ( KPL ) and X - ray films were imaged on a flatbed scanner and analysed using Image J ( http : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / ) . Immunofluorescence Cells were grown on sterile glass slides , fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 1 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , permeabilised for 10 min in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS and finally rinsed in 50mM glycine in PBS . Fixed cells were then stained by indirect immunofluorescence using a primary antibody against FLAG ( mouse , Sigma F3165 ) and secondary antibody against mouse IgG ( Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled ; Invitrogen ) to detect the transfected ESRP2 , together with Alexa Fluor 594 - labelled phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) to detect actin . Antibodies were diluted in PBS + 1 % bovine serum albumin , containing 0 . 1 µg / ml DAPI to image nuclei . Slides were mounted in Fluoroshield ( Sigma ) and examined with a confocal microscope , acquiring eight images at 1µm spacing per field . Maximum intensity projections were merged using Image J software ( http : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / ) . 14 RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) RNA was extracted from E200L cells 96 hrs after treatment with 2 µg / ml Dox , or control solvent ( DMSO ) , using an RNAeasy kit ( Qiagen ) , then DNase treated , and quality confirmed using an Agilent Screen tape RNA assay . Two biological replicates were used for RNA - seq ( i . e . four samples total ) . Sequencing libraries were prepared from total RNA ( 500 ng ) using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation kit ( Illumina , Inc . ) and uniquely barcoded adapters ( RNA LT adapters , Illumina , Inc ) . Libraries were pooled equimolarly for sequencing which was carried out on the NextSeq500 instrument ( Illumina , Inc . ) using the NextSeq High Output v2 150 - cycle kit ( Illumina , Inc . ) . Approximately 300 million paired reads ( passing filter , PF ) were obtained , divided between the four experimental samples . NextSeq Control Software Version 2 . 0 . 0 and RTA v2 . 4 . 6 were used for instrument control and primary analysis respectively . Reads from the four samples were mapped to the human genome ( hg19 ) using the new Tuxedo Suite of programs ( HISAT2 , StringTie , Ballgown ; https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pubmed / ? term = 27560171 ) . To identify RNA splicing alterations , the four BAM files generated by HISAT2 were used as input for rMATS ( ( 33 ) , replicate Multivariate Analysis of Transcript Splicing ; http : / / rnaseq - mats . sourceforge . net / user _ guide . htm ) . Bam files were viewed in the Integrative Genomics Viewer ( IGV ; http : / / software . broadinstitute . org / software / igv / ) to produce Sashimi plots of alternative splicing . The RNA - seq data have been deposited in NCBI ' s Gene Expression Omnibus ( 5 ) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE154496 : https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / query / acc . cgi ? acc = GSE154496 . 15 RESULTS Genome - wide DNA methylation analysis To identify novel epigenetically - regulated genes involved in WT pathogenesis , methyl CpG immunoprecipitation ( MCIP ) and promoter microarrays were used to detect regions that were DNA methylated in human fetal kidney and in two WT cell lines ; Wit49 ( 28 ) and 17 . 94 ( 29 ) . Windowed t - tests in ChIPMonk software were used to identify 225 genes that were hypermethylated in the WT cell lines compared with fetal kidney ( figure 1A and supplementary table S1 ) . Gene ontology analysis showed that this set of genes was especially enriched in genes involved in chromatin organisation , developmental processes , and transcriptional regulation ( figure 1B and supplementary table S2 ) . To define a group of genes that were specifically methylated in WT , two filters were applied to the list of methylated genes . Firstly , genes were removed that are polycomb repressive complex ( PRC ) marked in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells ( 34 ) , since such genes seem predisposed to become DNA methylated in a wide range of human cancers ( 35 - 37 ) and therefore would probably not be WT - specific . Secondly , a positive selection was applied for genes whose expression is upregulated in the renal vesicle early in kidney development ( 38 ) , reasoning that epigenetic inactivation of such genes could be involved in the block in mesenchymal to epithelial transition ( MET ) that is critical for WT development ( 3 ) . Using these criteria , four candidate genes were identified : CHST2 , KIT , PTTG1IP and ESRP2 ( RBM35B ) ( figure 1A and supplementary table S1 ) . Pyrosequencing was then used to examine the DNA methylation levels of these four genes in fetal kidney , normal kidney and a small number of Wilms tumours . Of the four candidate genes , ESRP2 was the most consistently methylated in WT ( figure 1C ) . ESRP2 was a particularly attractive candidate gene for further study , because of its previously described involvement in the control of alternative splicing events necessary for epithelial cell differentiation , which are abrogated in epithelial - mesenchymal transition in cancer ( 39 ) . Supporting evidence for a possible role for ESRP2 inactivation in WT came 16 from examination of the ESRP2 splicing target ENAH . ESRP2 induces the inclusion of the epithelial - specific alternatively spliced exon 11a in ENAH RNA transcripts ( 40 ) . Using RT - PCR across the alternatively spliced exon , less of the epithelial isoform of ENAH ( + exon 11A ) was expressed in WTs compared to normal kidney ( NK ) and fetal kidney ( FK ) , consistent with down - regulation of ESRP2 in WT ( figure 1D ) . We therefore went on to examine DNA methylation and expression of ESRP2 in two large cohorts of WTs . DNA methylation of ESRP2 in Wilms tumour A pyrosequencing assay was used to examine DNA methylation in the ESRP2 promoter CpG island ( CGI ) ; this assay was located centrally in the region that was identified by MCIP as being hypermethylated in the WT cell lines compared to fetal kidney ( supplementary figure S3 ) . In one cohort of WTs , the methylation of the closely related paralog ESRP1 was also studied by pyrosequencing . The first cohort of WTs was from Bristol Children’s Hospital ( BCH ) and consisted of tumour samples of all stages , mostly obtained at surgical resection , pre - chemotherapy . Of this group , 72 % of WTs were hypermethylated ( defined as DNA methylation > 25 % at the ESRP2 promoter ) compared to normal kidney tissue ( NT ) ( figure 2A and supplementary figure S4A ; NT mean = 13 % , 95 % CI = 9 - 17 % ; WT mean = 44 % , 95 % CI = 38 - 50 % ; means differ by 31 % ; p < 0 . 0005 , t - test ) . The second cohort was from samples collected at the Royal Marsden Hospital ( RMH ) as part of a UK - wide trial . These samples were from stages 1 to 3 and were taken at surgical resection , post - chemotherapy . In this different cohort , 78 % of WTs were hypermethylated ( figure 2B and supplementary figure S4C ; NT mean = 22 % , 95 % CI = 14 - 30 % ; WT mean = 38 % , 95 % CI = 33 - 44 % ; means differ by 16 % ; p = 0 . 0023 , t - test ) . ESRP1 DNA methylation was also tested in the RMH cohort and found to be very low ( < 2 % ) in both NT and WT , with no significant difference between NT and WT methylation ( figure 2B ; p = 0 . 24 , t - test ) . 17 Additional independent DNA methylation data was extracted for the ESRP1 and ESRP2 promoter CGIs from the publicly available dataset GSE59157 ( figure 2C ) , which examined WTs using Illumina bead chips ( 41 ) . This dataset also showed hypermethylation of ESRP2 in WTs ( NT mean = 0 . 17 , 95 % CI = 0 . 15 - 0 . 18 ; WT mean = 0 . 24 , 95 % CI = 0 . 21 - 0 . 27 ; means differ by 0 . 08 ; p = 0 . 0007 , t - test ) , with much lower methylation of ESRP1 , that was only marginally different in NT and WT ( NT mean = 0 . 08 , 95 % CI = 0 . 08 - 0 . 09 ; WT mean = 0 . 09 , 95 % CI = 0 . 09 - 0 . 10 ; means differ by 0 . 01 ; p = 0 . 04 , t - test ) . Thus , ESRP2 DNA was found to be hypermethylated in two independent cohorts of WTs and these findings were confirmed in another independent set of publicly available data . However , the ESRP2 paralog ESRP1 was not found to be hypermethylated in WT , despite the similar biological functions described for the two paralogs ( 42 ) . The relationship between tumour stage and ESRP2 DNA methylation was investigated in the two cohorts of tumours but there was no significant association with stage in either cohort ( supplementary figures S5A and B ) . WTs from both cohorts were divided into hypermethylated ( > 25 % methylation ) and non - methylated groups ( < 25 % methylation ) , and overall patient survival examined . There was no association between ESRP2 methylation and survival , with opposite non - significant trends in the two cohorts ( supplementary figure S6 ) . These results suggest that ESRP2 methylation is not associated with different clinical stages or outcomes in WT . ESRP2 is located on chromosome 16q22 ( https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / gene / 80004 ) , which is a chromosomal region found to show frequent loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) in WT ( 43 ) . The relationship between 16q LOH and ESRP2 DNA methylation was therefore tested in the BCH cohort , which had previously been characterised for 16q LOH ( 21 ) . No difference was observed in the ESRP2 methylation in WTs with or without 16q LOH ( supplementary figure S5C ) . Most WTs are thought to develop via premalignant lesions , known as a nephrogenic rests ( NR ) , which are frequently found in the kidney tissue adjacent to WTs ( 4 ) . To characterise 18 the phase of WT development at which ESRP2 DNA methylation occurs , methylation was assayed in two sets of matched NK , NR and WT from the BCH cohort . ESRP2 was DNA hypermethylated at a similar level in NR and the matched WT compared to NK ( figure 2D ) . In contrast , RASSF1A , a tumour suppressor gene that is frequently hypermethylated in WT ( 24 ) , was not hypermethylated in NRs ( figure 2D ) , as previously reported ( 23 ) . Dataset GSE59157 ( discussed above ) also contains methylation data on nephrogenic rests , so methylation values for the ESRP2 and RASSFIA promoter CGIs were extracted for all WTs that showed hypermethylation in these genes compared to their matched NK samples ( figure 2E ) . In those tumours , ESRP2 was significantly more methylated in WT compared to NK ( NK mean = 0 . 16 , 95 % CI = 0 . 14 - 0 . 17 ; WT mean = 0 . 28 , 95 % CI = 0 . 22 - 0 . 35 ; means differ by 0 . 12 ; p = 0 . 0002 , Tukey’s pairwise test ) , but there was no significant difference between WT and NR methylation ( NR mean = 0 . 23 , 95 % CI = 0 . 21 - 0 . 26 ; WT mean = 0 . 28 , 95 % CI = 0 . 22 - 0 . 35 ; means differ by 0 . 05 ; p = 0 . 12 , Tukey’s pairwise test ) but NRs were hypermethylated compared to NK ( NK mean = 0 . 16 , 95 % CI = 0 . 14 - 0 . 17 ; NR mean = 0 . 23 , 95 % CI = 0 . 21 - 0 . 26 ; means differ by 0 . 07 ; p = 0 . 025 , Tukey’s pairwise test ) . In contrast , whilst RASSF1A was hypermethylated in WTs compared to NK ( NK mean = 0 . 27 , 95 % CI = 0 . 24 - 0 . 31 ; WT mean = 0 . 66 , 95 % CI = 0 . 56 - 0 . 77 ; means differ by 0 . 39 ; p = 0 . 0001 , Tukey’s pairwise test ) , NRs were not significantly hypermethylated compared to NK ( NK mean = 0 . 27 , 95 % CI = 0 . 24 - 0 . 31 ; NR mean = 0 . 37 , 95 % CI = 0 . 32 - 0 . 42 ; means differ by 0 . 10 ; p = 0 . 12 , Tukey’s pairwise test ) . Therefore , in both the BCH and GSE59157 datasets , ESRP2 appeared to be hypermethylated in NRs compared to NK , whereas RASSF1A was not , implying that ESRP2 hypermethylation is an earlier event in WT development compared to RASSF1A hypermethylation . To investigate whether epigenetic changes , including ESRP2 hypermethylation in WT , are associated with other clinical and molecular features , the BCH cohort of WTs were studied , since these WTs have been extensively investigated for LOH , loss of imprinting ( LOI ) , WT1 mutations and their relationship to clinical parameters ( 21 , 22 , 44 - 50 ) . In addition to ESRP2 19 methylation , DNA methylation was measured by pyrosequencing at other loci previously shown to have consistent epigenetic changes in WT ; the WT1 antisense regulatory region ( ARR ) ( 22 ) , the H19 differentially methylated region ( DMR ) ( 21 ) and RASSF1A ( 24 ) . WTs were then grouped by hierarchical clustering of the DNA methylation values at the four loci ( figure 2F and supplementary table S3 ) , which divided them into two major clusters and one minor cluster . There were no associations between these clusters and either stage , outcome , LOH or LOI ( figure 2F and supplementary table S3 ) . Interestingly , all tumours with WT1 mutations were in the same cluster ( group 3 ) , in which there was less methylation of RASSF1A and ESRP2 compared to the other two groups ( figure 2F and supplementary table S3 ) . This may suggest that WT1 mutation and DNA hypermethylation of certain genes , including ESRP2 , are mutually exclusive . ESRP2 DNA methylation was also examined in 16 non - WT childhood renal tumours from BCH ( supplementary figure S7A ) and hypermethylation was observed in 10 ( 63 % ) , which was most marked in clear cell sarcomas of the kidney ( CCSK ) and in rhabdoid tumours ( RH ) . In two publicly available datasets ( GSE73187 ( 51 ) and GSE4487 ( 52 ) ) , ESRP2 was also found to be hypermethylated in CCSK ( supplementary figures S7B and C ) and in RH ( supplementary figure S7B ) , suggesting that epigenetic inactivation of ESRP2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of several types of renal tumours of childhood , not just WT . Expression of ESRP2 in Wilms tumour To determine whether the DNA hypermethylation of ESRP2 leads to epigenetic deregulation of ESRP2 expression , ESRP2 RNA expression was analysed by QPCR in the two WT cohorts ( figure 3 and supplementary figure S4 ) . In the BCH cohort , expression of ESRP2 in WT was very low compared to normal kidney tissue ( figure 3A and supplementary figure S4B ) ( NT mean = 1 . 2 , 95 % CI = 0 . 5 - 1 . 9 ; WT mean = 0 . 1 ; 95 % CI = 0 . 0 - 0 . 2 ; means differ by1 . 1 ; p = 0 . 013 , t - test ) . When WTs were divided 20 into two groups by their ESRP2 methylation status ( figure 3B ) , hypermethylation was seen to be associated with reduced expression of ESRP2 ( hypomethylated mean = 0 . 57 ; 95 % CI = 0 . 17 - 0 . 97 ; hypermethylated mean = 0 . 11 ; 95 % CI = 0 . 03 - 0 . 19 ; means differ by 0 . 46 ; p = 0 . 033 , t - test ) . In the RMH cohort , expression of ESRP2 was also reduced in WT compared to NT ( figure 3C and supplementary figure S4D ) ( NT mean = 0 . 35 ; 95 % CI = 0 . 20 - 0 . 50 ; WT mean = 0 . 06 ; 95 % CI = 0 . 03 - 0 . 09 ; means differ by 0 . 29 ; p = 0 . 002 , t - test ) . ESRP1 expression was also examined in the RMH cohort ( figure 3C ) but it was not significantly different in WT compared to NT ( NT mean = 0 . 18 , 95 % CI = 0 . 04 - 0 . 32 ; WT mean = 0 . 09 , 95 % CI = 0 . 04 - 0 . 15 ; means differ by 0 . 09 ; p = 0 . 22 , t - test ) . These findings were confirmed using publicly available microarray data ( GSE2712 ; ( 53 ) ) on gene expression in WTs versus NT ( figure 3D ) . In this dataset ESRP2 expression was lower in WT compared to NT ( NT mean = 1188 , 95 % CI = 734 - 1641 ; WT mean = 631 , 95 % CI = 464 - 798 ; means differ by 556 ; p = 0 . 009 , t - test ) , but ESRP1 expression did not differ significantly ( NT mean = 770 , 95 % CI = 56 - 1483 ; WT mean = 622 , 95 % CI = 290 - 954 ; difference between means = 148 , p = 0 . 54 , t - test ) . These results showed that ESRP2 but not ESRP1 expression was reduced in WTs compared to NT and that reduced expression of ESRP2 was associated with hypermethylation . This suggested a mechanistic link between ESRP2 methylation and gene expression , so this was tested directly using a pharmacological inhibitor of DNA methylation on two hypermethylated WT cells lines ( methylation data shown in figure 1C and supplementary figure S4A ) . When the two WT cell lines were treated with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5 - aza - 2’ - deoxycytidine ( Aza ) , there was a 5 - 10 - fold increase in ESRP2 RNA expression ( p < 0 . 05 , paired t - test ) ( figure 3E ) . 21 Biological function of ESRP2 in vitro The methylation and expression results described above suggested that ESRP2 may have an important functional role in the development of WT . To carry out functional analyses on ESRP2 in Wilms tumour , the WT cell line Wit49 was transfected with an expression vector that encodes full - length human ESRP2 under the control of a doxycycline ( Dox ) - inducible promoter ( supplementary figure S2 ) . The cell line ( E200L ) showed strong Dox - induced expression of ESRP2 RNA ( figure 4A ) and protein ( figure 4B ) , with the expected nuclear localisation of ESRP2 protein ( figures 4D to G ) . Induced expression of ESRP2 drove the splicing of the known target gene ENAH ( 40 ) towards its epithelial splice form , with increased expression of transcripts containing exon 11a ( figure 4C ) , demonstrating that the inserted ESRP2 construct produced biologically active protein in the WT cell line . ESRP2 expression affected biological properties of the transfected cells . Over - expression of ESRP2 was associated with an apparent redistribution of actin filaments towards the cell periphery ( figure 4F , G ) , compared to the more cytoplasmic distribution of actin stress fibres seen in the uninduced cells ( figure 4D , E ) . This is like observations of the effect of overexpression of ESRPs in other systems ( 54 , 55 ) . Dox - induced ESRP2 overexpression caused decreased colony - forming efficiency in the E200L WT cell line ( figure 5H ) , as well as a reduced growth rate in mass cultures ( supplementary figure S8 ) . Real - time analysis of cell density showed a slower cell proliferation rate in the Dox - induced E200L cells ( figure 4I ) , which was associated with a decreased rate of cell division as assessed by Cell Trace Violet ( CTV ) staining ( figure 4J , K ) . Measurement of cell invasion using a transwell assay ( supplementary figure S9A ) and of cell motility using a scratch assay ( supplementary figure S9B ) , showed no differences between EPRP2 - induced and uninduced cells . These results therefore suggested that downregulation of ESRP2 expression may play a role in loss of growth control in Wilms tumour cells , but probably not in cell motility and invasion . 22 Xenograft assays of ESRP2 function in vivo The effect of ESRP2 expression on tumorigenicity in vivo , was tested by injecting the Wit49 - derived cell lines into nude mice ( figure 5 ) . We used orthotopic xenografts under the kidney capsule , since this procedure has been shown to give a more authentic WT - like histology than subcutaneous xenografts ( 56 ) . Monitoring of tumour growth by whole - body luciferase fluorescence imaging ( figures 5A to C ) , showed that after treatment with Dox , tumours produced by injecting V200 cells continued to proliferate , whilst tumours produced by E200L cells stopped growing , or regressed . Western blotting of excised tumours demonstrated that Dox treatment of the mice had induced ESRP2 expression in E200L tumours but not in V200 tumours ( figure 5D ) . Thus , ESRP2 expression in the Wit49 cell line acts as a tumour suppressor in an orthotopic model of in vivo tumorigenicity . RNA - seq analysis of alternative splicing in Wilms tumour cell lines The evidence just described suggested that ESRP2 is epigenetically repressed in Wilms tumours , where it can act as functional tumour suppressor . Given the previous identification of ESRP2 as a regulator of alternative splicing ( 27 , 39 , 42 ) , we used RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) of the Wit49 - derived cell lines to identify alternative splicing events that could contribute to the pathogenesis of Wilms tumour . In biological duplicates , we extracted RNA from E200L cells that were Dox - induced ( ESRP2 - expressing ) or uninduced ( non - expressing ) , and sequenced them , obtaining between 70 and 80 million paired - end reads per sample . These reads were mapped onto the human genome , examined for differential gene expression , and used in rMATS software ( 33 ) to identify alternative splicing events . Very few transcripts , apart from ESRP2 , showed significant changes in RNA expression ( p < 0 . 05 , fold change > 2 ) when ESRP2 expression was induced in E200L cells ( figure 6A and B ) . Interestingly , one induced gene was GRHL1 , and the grainyhead - like transcription factors have been shown to be important in both kidney development and MET ( 57 ) , making 23 them good candidates for an involvement in WT . Using a specific QPCR assay , we confirmed the induction of GRHL1 expression following ESRP2 induction ( figure 6C ) , but we found no difference in expression of GRHL1 between NT and WT ( figure 6D ) , which does not support a role for altered GRHL1 expression in WT pathogenesis . In contrast to the lack of altered gene transcription , ESRP2 induction was associated with over 900 altered splicing events involving over 700 genes , with significant changes ( False Discovery Rate , FDR < 0 . 05 ) in skipped exons ( SE ) , mutually exclusive exons ( MXE ) and retained introns ( RI ) ( figure 7A , supplementary tables S4 , S5 , S6 ) . The genes involved in these alternative splicing events were particularly enriched for biological processes concerned with vesicular and intracellular transport ( figure 7B , supplementary table S7 ) . There have been several previous studies identifying ESRP target genes in different biological contexts . Compared to other reports identifying specific targets of ESRPs using RNA - seq ( 58 , 59 ) , we found several targets in common , including well - known genes such as CD44 , CTNND1 , SCRIB and SLK , as well as over 600 genes that had not been previously described as ESRP2 targets ( figure 7C ) . An additional comparison with a recent study of MET - associated alternative splicing changes during kidney development ( 60 ) also revealed overlap with some of our target genes ( figure 7D ) . Interestingly , the two lists of genes identified in figures 7C and D as overlapping our ESRP2 targets , included five genes in common ( CTNND1 , CTTN , FLNB , MAO3K7 , MPRIP ; shown in bold in figures 7C and D ) . This extensive overlap ( 33 - 36 % ) between ESRP2 targets and genes showing splicing changes during kidney MET , emphasises the importance of ESRP - regulated alternative splicing in normal kidney development . We first validated the putative target genes identified by RNA - seq , by using specific RT - PCR assays across alternatively spliced exons , to examine whether exon inclusion differed upon ESRP2 induction in the E200L cell line . We successfully validated several previously identified targets ; CD44 , ENAH , FGFR2 , SCRIB and SLK ( supplementary figure S10 ) , as well as the novel targets LEF1 , NPHP1 and RAC1 ( figure 7E , F , G ) . However , some 24 putative target genes showed no altered splicing after ESRP2 induction ( supplementary figure S11 ) . Overall , using the E200L cell line system , out of a total of 12 splicing events tested , 8 ( 67 % ) were validated . Seven of these events were novel , of which 3 ( 43 % ) were validated ( supplementary table S8 ) . To investigate the possible role of ESRP2 target genes in WT pathogenesis , we examined alternative splicing of 12 genes ( seven novel and five previously described ) , using the RT - PCR assays in fetal kidney , normal kidney and Wilms tumour ( figure 8 and supplementary figure S12 ) . Five genes showed significantly changes in the degree of alternative splicing between normal tissues and WT ( figure 8 ) , including one novel gene , LEF1 . Seven genes did not show significant changes ( supplementary figure S12 ) , of which six were novel genes . Overall , 42 % of the genes tested ( five out of 12 ) demonstrated alternative splicing changes in WT , of which four were previously described targets ( supplementary table S8 ) . 25 DISCUSSION In this paper we have used genome - wide DNA methylation analysis to identify over 200 WT - associated epigenetic alterations . GO analysis showed that the hypermethylated genes were enriched in genes involved in developmental processes ( figure 1B ) . Filtering of our gene list to remove those likely to be commonly epigenetically repressed in cancer , and to identify genes vital for early kidney development , highlighted four genes , one of which , ESRP2 , was shown to be frequently hypermethylated in WT in an initial small - scale validation ( figure 1C ) . Further investigations in two large independent WT cohorts demonstrated that ESRP2 was hypermethylated in over 70 % of WTs , which was confirmed using a publicly available dataset ( figure 2A to C ) . Hypermethylation of ESRP2 was associated with down - regulation of ESRP2 expression , demonstrated in the two independent WT cohorts and another publicly available dataset ( figure 3A to D ) . A mechanistic link between ESRP2 DNA methylation and expression was further strengthened by the pharmacological reactivation of ESRP2 by the methyltransferase inhibitor AZA in two hypermethylated WT cell lines ( figure 3E ) . This is the first demonstration of loss of ESRP2 expression caused by DNA methylation in Wilms tumour , and implicates RNA splicing alterations as an important pathogenic factor in WT development . Investigation of ESRP2 DNA methylation in two matched sets of NK , nephrogenic rest ( NR ) and WT , showed that ESRP2 hypermethylation was at similar levels in NR and WT ( figure 2D ) . This was confirmed in a publicly available dataset containing a much larger number of NRs ( figure 2E ) . We also confirmed previous observations that RASSF1A , an epigenetically repressed tumour suppressor gene , is only hypermethylated in WTs , not in NRs . These results suggest that inactivation of ESRP2 by DNA methylation occurs prior to NR formation , at an early stage in kidney development . This contrasts with RASSF1A , which is only hypermethylated in WTs , suggesting that it is epigenetically inactivated after NR formation . Mechanistically , the timing of ESRP2 DNA methylation leads to a model in which ESRP2 is involved in early events in kidney development that are essential for the normal epithelial 26 differentiation of the metanephric blastema into nephrons ( figure 9 ) . Therefore , loss of ESRP2 expression due to DNA hypermethylation causes a differentiation block . This block initiates the persistence of undifferentiated renal precursors , which may then grow into a NR , that can then undergo further genetic and epigenetic defects to produce a WT ( figure 9 ) . Support for this model comes from previous studies that have shown that the Esrp paralogs are expressed in the developing kidney ( 61 ) and that knockout of Esrp genes in mice decreases kidney volume , due to a lack of nephrons ( 62 ) . The frequent epigenetic inactivation of ESRP2 in early WT development , means that most WTs acquire this epigenetic lesion as a premalignant event , which probably explains why we found no association with clinical features of the WTs studied ( supplementary figures S5 and S6 ) . It also explains why we found no association between ESRP2 methylation and LOH at 16q ( supplementary figure S5 ) , where the ESRP2 gene is located , because we have previously demonstrated that 16q LOH is a relatively late event in WT pathogenesis , occurring after NR formation ( 21 ) i . e . after ESPR2 hypermethylation has occurred . Interestingly , when we clustered WTs by DNA methylation at four loci , including ESRP2 , we found no clinical associations , but we did find that all tumours with WT1 mutations were in the same cluster , in which the WTs had relatively low levels of ESRP2 DNA methylation ( figure 2F ) . A recent comprehensive characterisation of genetic and epigenetic defects in a large series of WTs , also found that all WT1 - mutant tumours were in a distinct group , based on DNA genome - wide DNA methylation analysis ( 14 ) . We have shown here that ESRP2 hypermethylation is an early event , being found in NRs ( figure 2D , E ) , like WT1 mutations ( 63 , 64 ) . These results therefore suggest that WT1 mutation and ESRP2 hypermethylation could be alternate early events in WT development , each of which can contribute to WT pathogenesis by inhibiting MET ( figure 9 ) . We have also found that ESRP2 hypermethylation occurs in other childhood renal tumours ( supplementary figure S7 ) . Premalignant lesions analogous to NRs are unavailable for these tumours , so we have no way of knowing if ESRP2 hypermethylation is an early or late 27 event in the pathogenesis of these cancers . The different histology of these childhood renal tumours ( 65 ) , together with more recent evidence on their cellular origins ( 66 , 67 ) , suggest that whilst ESRP2 plays a role in their development , it is unlikely that their pathogenesis involves an MET block identical to that seen in WT . We have shown that ESRP1 , though an ESRP2 paralogue , is not hypermethylated in WTs ( figure 2B , C ) , suggesting that ESRP1 and ESRP2 may have different biological functions and are regulated differently in some instances . Similarly , a recent paper ( 68 ) has reported that only ESRP2 and not ESRP1 is regulated by androgens , with important implications in prostate cancer progression . Splicing alterations are frequent in human cancers ( 69 ) , including changes induced by ESRP genes , such as in breast cancer ( 54 , 70 ) , prostate cancer ( 68 , 71 ) , renal cell carcinoma ( 72 ) and colorectal cancer ( 73 ) . In most cases , ESRP genes appear to have tumour suppressive properties , presumably because loss of ESRP expression permits EMT ( 27 , 39 ) , which is important in many stages of carcinogenesis , especially the acquisition of malignant characteristics i . e . invasion and metastasis . ( 74 ) . This contrasts with the results reported in this paper , where loss of ESRP2 function appears to inhibit MET at a very early , premalignant stage of tumour development . Most studies on ESRP genes in human cancer demonstrate expression changes but without any reported underlying genetic or epigenetic defects in the ESRP genes themselves ( 54 , 68 , 70 , 72 , 73 ) . However , there have been reports of genetic defects in ESRP genes in human cancers , specifically , microsatellite indels ( 75 ) or duplications ( 71 ) of ESRP1 . In addition , there have been reports of DNA methylation changes of ESRP1 in prostate cancer ( 76 ) and of ESRP2 in breast cancer ( 77 ) . Thus , our results add to a growing body of evidence that ESRP genes can be either genetically or epigenetically deregulated in a wide range of human cancers . Functionally , our studies with a WT cell line carrying an inducible ESRP2 construct , suggest that the main biological effect of ESRP2 is to regulate cell proliferation by slowing cell 28 division ( figure 4H to K and supplementary figure S8 ) . Whilst we observed some actin cytoskeleton rearrangement ( figure 4 D to G ) , we did not observe significant expression changes in classical epithelial marker genes ( figure 6 ) , nor any changes in cell motility or invasion ( supplementary figure S9 ) , as have been reported in studies where ESRP expression has been modulated in adult human cancer cell lines ( 39 , 54 , 55 ) . Coupled with our xenograft experiments that identify ESRP2 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in a WT line cell ( figure 5 ) , these results suggest that the tumour suppressor activity of ESRP2 in WT occurs mainly by altering cell growth properties , rather than by affecting cellular differentiation . Mechanistically , our RNA - seq results demonstrate that ESRP2 modulates the splicing of a diverse range of genes , including both well - established and novel targets ( figure 7 and supplementary tables S4 to S6 ) . We showed that a subset of these genes demonstrate reduced expression of their epithelial splice forms in WT ( figure 8 ) , consistent with the DNA - methylation induced down - regulation of ESRP2 that we have observed in the majority of WTs ( figures 2 and 3 ) . Interestingly , LEF1 , a novel ESRP2 target gene that shows deregulated splicing in WTs ( figure 7E and 8C ) , is a component of the Wnt signalling pathway ( 78 ) and is important for the differentiation of nephron progenitor cells during kidney development ( 79 ) . Disruption of the Wnt pathway has been identified as central to WT pathogenesis ( 3 ) , with mutations observed in the Wnt pathway genes CTNNB1 ( 6 , 7 ) and WTX ( AMER1 ) ( 8 ) and Wt1 shown to be essential in the control of Wnt4 during normal nephrogenesis ( 80 ) . Thus , epigenetic inactivation of ESRP2 , as described here , could elicit an early defect in the Wnt pathway via its modulation of LEF1 splicing ( 81 ) , with similar effects to the loss of WT1 early in WT pathogenesis . Interestingly , of the 728 genes that we identified as having their splicing modulated by ESRP2 ( figure 7 ) , only 62 ( 9 % ) are WT1 DNA - binding targets ( 82 ) , whereas 244 ( 34 % ) are WT1 RNA - binding targets ( 83 ) ( figure 9A ) . The WT1 RNA - binding targets include all five of the ESRP2 - regulated genes that we found in common between our results and two other 29 RNA - seq studies ( figure 7C , D ) . This suggest that post - transcriptional regulation of gene expression , either by ESRP2 or WT1 , may be alternative mechanisms for regulating important renal developmental genes . This could explain the different DNA methylation profiles that we observed in WTs with and without WT1 mutations ( figure 2F ) , suggesting that epigenetic inactivation of ESRP2 and mutation of WT1 are alternate events that control an early stage of WT development ( figure 9B , C ) . These results , together with genetic evidence showing defects in miRNA - processing genes in WT ( 9 - 13 ) , reinforce the critical role that post - transcriptional gene regulation plays in WT pathogenesis . 30 Figure legends Figure 1 : Identification of ESRP2 as a candidate hypermethylated gene A : Venn diagram showing filtering of the 225 methylated genes that were identified by MCIP , firstly by negative selection for genes that are PRC marked in ES cells ( 34 ) and secondly by positive selection for genes that are upregulated in the renal vesicle during kidney development ( 38 ) .
