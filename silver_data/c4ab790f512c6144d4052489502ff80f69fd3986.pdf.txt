Methods : A community - based cross - sectional observational study was conducted . Data was collected using a self - constructed online google survey tool from July 2020 to August 2020 . Results : Out of a total 1083 sample , a higher proportion of the participants ( 41 . 3 % ) belonged to the 34 - 49 years age group , followed by the age group of 50 - 65 ( 32 . 5 % ) . The sample was almost equally distributed ; about 51 . 9 % of the population was male , and 48 . 4 % were female . The COVID - 19 positivity was recorded almost double ( 3 . 1 % ) in groups not practicing 3SRB exercises compared to a group ( 1 . 3 % ) practicing 3SRB exercises . Furthermore , the practice of 3SRB was significantly associated with a lower percentage of COVID - 19 infection ( p = 0 . 046 ) . Conclusions : Practice of 3SRB is significantly associated with a lower percentage of COVID - 19 infection . A future study with a robust methodology is warranted to validate the findings of this study and determine the effects of 3SRB on physiological and biological markers .

Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic has become a significant cause of physical & psychological distress and deaths worldwide . Many European and Asian countries have faced a second wave of the pandemic while India is experiencing the second wave at present The COVID - 19 damages the respiratory tract , obstructing airflow . 1 It triggers asthma attacks and causes acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . 2 Deep breathing exercises that clear the lungs and strengthen lung function may be especially beneficial for people with these conditions . 3 , 4 Evidence indicates that breathing exercises improve lung functions , 5 , 6 boost immunity , 7 and manages stress . 8 However , the effect of breathing exercise on COVID - 19 infection is not yet established . Three - Step Breathing exercise is a breathing pattern that aids an individual ‘breathe in rhythm with nature . It is a slow and deep breathing technique founded by Yogi Sri Soli Tavaria . It is also known as refining exercises and is believed to cleanse impurities from the mind and the body . Studies on the effect of Three Step Rhythmic Breathing ( 3SRB ) on COVID - 19 remain unknown . Anecdotal experience that breathing exercises can strengthen the lungs and may be beneficial for reducing the impact of COVID - 19 before , during , and after it strikes . The present study attempted to determine the prevalence of COVID - 19 among people practicing 3SRB exercise and those who are not practicing 3SRB exercise in India . Methods A community - based cross - sectional observational study was conducted . Data was collected using a self - constructed online google survey tool from July 2020 to August 2020 . The data entry was done using Microsoft Office Excel 2019 . Descriptive statistics of frequency , percentages , mean and standard deviation ( SD ) were used to summarize the data . Categorical variables are represented as frequencies and percentages and analyzed using the χ 2 test or Fisher’s exact test . All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ( Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ) version 23 . 0 software ( SPSS , Inc ) . A 2 - sided α ( Alpha ) level at less than 0 . 05 or 0 . 01 was considered statistically significant . Results Table 1 shows the socio - demographic characteristics of the study respondents . A higher proportion ( 40 . 3 % for group A and 42 . 4 % in group B , respectively ) of the participants belonged to the 34 - 49 years age group , followed by the age group of 50 - 65 years ( 31 . 4 % and 32 . 5 % respectively ) .

About 51 . 9 % of the population was male , and 48 . 4 % were female . About 32 . 1 % of participants were homemakers or retired , 28 . 1 % were doing service , and 20 . 6 % were engaged in business . In the study , the majority of respondents ( 93 . 1 % ) were from Gujarat , followed by Maharashtra ( 4 . 4 % ) , and the rest were from other States ( 2 . 5 % ) . Current comorbidities included diabetes ( 7 % ) , hypertension ( 5 . 1 % ) , followed by the highest prevalence of a comorbid condition of diabetes , hypertension , or heart disease ( 8 % ) . Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of study participants . Characteristics of persons practicing 3SRB Total 598 participants were practicing 3SRB . About 47 . 9 % were practicing for less than a year , and 79 . 8 % were practicing daily . Table 2 presents the characteristics of 3SRB practice . Out of the total , 11 . 7 % of 3SRB practitioners were reported treating other chronic diseases . These diseases were diabetes ( 2 . 3 % ) , Arthritis / Spondylitis ( 2 % ) , Blood pressure ( 1 . 8 % ) , Psychological distress such as depression , anxiety and stress ( 1 . 8 % ) , Asthma ( 1 . 2 % ) , hypertension & thyroid ( 1 % respectively ) , thyroid ( 1 % ) , and cardiovascular disease ( 0 . 2 % ) . Many participants ( 1 . 7 % ) reported treating Parkinson ' s , Psoriasis , etc . Prevalence of COVID - 19 in the study population Overall prevalence was 2 . 1 % in the study population ; 1 . 3 % in group A followed by 3 . 1 % in group B , as shown in Table 3 . The association between practice and non - practitioners of 3SRB and COVID - 19 was significant ( p = 0 . 046 ) . Table 4 presents data on COVID - 19 positive cases in the family and the residential areas among both groups . In the total sample , 4 . 1 % of participants’ family members were tested positive for COVID - 19 and was a non - significant association for COVID - 19 infection across two groups ( p = 0 . 827 ) . Nearly half of participants ( 48 . 6 % ) had COVID - 19 cases in their residential area , whereas 33 . 7 % reported COVID - 19 cases in their wards . COVID - 19 cases in their resident area and ward were not statistically significant with COVID - 19 ( p = 0 . 076 ) . Association between independent variables and COVID - 19 positivity across Two Groups Table 5 presents an association between independent variables with COVID - 19 in both groups . More than half ( 65 . 2 % ) positive cases belonged to the 34 - 49 years of age group , and most men ( 87 % ) were affected . In terms of occupation , persons from the business ( 56 . 5 % ) and service ( 34 . 8 ) category were primarily affected with COVID - 19 . .

Symptoms were more frequent in positive individuals ( 47 . 8 % ) than those not diagnosed with COVID - 19 ( 6 . 1 % ) . About 43 . 5 % of COVID - 19 positive cases were from Surat , followed by 26 . 1 % from Ahmedabad . Both of these cities were marked with a high case of COVID - 19 in the State during the study period . Table 7 presents the distribution of COVID - 19 positive cases across cities . As presented in Table 8 , about 56 . 6 % of the study participants infected with COVID - 19 were practicing yoga , meditation , exercise , or any combination of these , and more than half of them ( 65 . 2 % ) have reported using herbs for recovery . Discussion The study disclosed the prevalence of COVID - 19 as 2 . 1 % in the entire study population , corresponding to 23 individuals infected with the novel coronavirus . About 1 . 3 % positivity was observed in group A who were practicing 3SRB or refining exercise , and 3 . 1 % prevalence in group B , who were not practicing refining exercise . The prevalence is higher than the recently conducted study among Healthcare workers ( 1 . 8 % ) 11 and the study conducted in Brazil , which reported a prevalence of 2 . 1 % COVID - 19 infection . 12 Further , an association between practice and non - practitioners of 3SRB and COVID - 19 was significant ( p = 0 . 046 ) . The majority of study participants infected with COVID - 19 were engaged in business or service , suggesting occupation as a critical determinant of COVID - 19 . As such , physical activity and or exercise were beneficial in ameliorating some of the respiratory difficulties and psychological distress ; 13 , 14 which is endorsed by the present study ' s findings . However , due to small numbers of positive cases , a significant effect of exercise could not be determined . Positivity in a family , ward , or residential area was associated with COVID - 19 infection ; however , the association was not significant . In the total sample , 4 . 1 % of respondents’ family members were tested positive for COVID - 19 . A positive case in the family is an expected result in a fast - evolving epidemic like COVID - 19 . 15 , 16 Nevertheless , at this point , it is possible to observe a higher probability of positive contacts when the family member is detected COVID - 19 positive . Recent systematic reviews conducted by Shah et al . 17 indicated that the secondary attack rate in household contacts was found to be ranging between 4 . 6 and 49 . 56 % . The study did not evaluate contributing factors of COVID - 19 positivity and factors such as age , duration of the positive case in the family , house dimensions , and .

Recent studies indicate that spouses and the elderly are more prone to secondary infection than the younger population ( supported through reported odds ) . Minors ( < 18 / < 20 years ) are at lower risk of SAR . 18 , 19 Among all positive individuals , 52 . 2 % were asymptomatic , and the proportion was lower than other studies that reveal the frequency of symptoms as high as 81 % . 16 Moreover , symptoms were more frequent in positive individuals ( 47 . 8 % compared to 6 . 1 % in negative individuals ) , indicating validity for the test and is in concordance with results from other studies . 17 , 18 The information about symptoms was referent to their occurrence in the last three months in this study . The longer lag time between symptoms occurrence and reporting could increase their frequencies , but it increases the possibility of memory bias . Strength and limitations of the study To the best of our knowledge , the study is the first to assess the prevalence of COVID - 19 infection among people practicing 3SRB and those who were not practicing . Our study has some notable limitations . First , we compared individuals practicing the 3SRB exercise with non - practicing individuals . The data collection was facilitated through volunteers of 3SRB exercise groups , which may introduce participant selection bias . Therefore , our results should be interpreted carefully . Second , we have used self - reported COVID - 19 positivity , and not performed COVID - 19 tests may present self - reporting bias . This may have generated a socially desirable response , and many might have intentionally hidden their status of COVID - 19 infection due to prevalence stigma . Third , the 3SRB exercise emerged as beneficial in protecting them from COVID - 19 ; however , the findings can not be easily attributable only to 3SRB as confounding variables such as yoga , meditation , pranayama , and herbs might have influenced the outcomes . Finally , a cross - sectional study design cannot establish causality between various socio - demographic factors and COVID - 19 . Conclusion The current study indicated that the prevalence of COVID - 19 is lower among people practicing 3SRB compared to those who are not practicing 3SRB and the difference was statistically significant . The 3SRB exercise can be a promising practice for the prevention and may promote better recovery from the infection . Prospective large - scale studies should consider controlling confounding variables . A future study using a robust methodology such as a randomized control trial or case - control trial should be conducted to validate the findings of this study and determine the effects of 3SRB on COVID - 19 infection , disease progression , and management using biological markers . .
