Joliot , Institut de Biologie Physico - Chimique , Paris , France , December 30 , 2002 ( received for review October 18 , 2002 ) In photosynthesis , highly organized multiprotein assemblies con - vert sunlight into biochemical energy with high efﬁciency . A challenge in structural biology is to analyze such supramolecular complexes in native membranes . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) with high lateral resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio , and the possibility to nanodissect biological samples is a unique tool to investigate multiprotein complexes at molecular resolution in situ . Here we present high - resolution AFM of the photosynthetic core complex in native Rhodopseudomonas viridis membranes . Topo - graphs at 10 - Å lateral and (cid:1) 1 - Å vertical resolution reveal a single reaction center ( RC ) surrounded by a closed ellipsoid of 16 light - harvesting ( LH1 ) subunits . Nanodissection of the tetraheme cyto - chrome ( 4Hcyt ) subunit from the RC allows demonstration that the L and M subunits exhibit an asymmetric topography intimately associated to the LH1 subunits located at the short ellipsis axis . This architecture implies a distance distribution between the antenna and the RC compared with a centered location of the RC within a circular LH1 , which may inﬂuence the energy transfer within the core complex . The LH1 subunits rearrange into a circle after removal of the RC from the core complex . P hotosynthetic organisms fuel their metabolism with light energy and have developed for this purpose an efficient apparatus for harvesting and converting sunlight into biochem - ical energy . The initial steps of photosynthesis , universal in photosynthetic bacteria , algae , and higher plants , comprise light absorption by a set of light - harvesting ( LH ) pigment – protein complexes and subsequent transfer of the excitation energy to the reaction center ( RC ) , where charge separation across the membrane takes place . In photosynthetic bacteria , the so - called core complex , constituted of a RC intimately associated with LH1 , performs these initial steps of the photosynthesis : light trapping and charge separation . The efficiency of the process demands high structural organization of the components . The spatial organization between LH1 and RC is still a matter of debate ( 1 – 8 ) , and no information on their assembly in a native system is available . Complementary to structure determination of individual components at near - atomic resolution ( 9 – 11 ) , one of the main challenges today is to describe the supramolecular organization of the photosynthetic machinery in native mem - branes ( 12 ) . From a more general standpoint , structural biology is in need of a technique with a lateral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio good enough to identify individual components of a multiprotein complex in situ ( 13 ) . The atomic force microscope ( 14 ) has developed into a powerful tool in structural biology ( 15 , 16 ) . It was demonstrated that topographs of two - dimensional crystals of membrane pro - teins can be acquired at subnanometer resolution ( 17 ) . In addition , the high signal - to - noise ratio in raw data atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) topographs allows single - molecule imaging ( 16 , 18 , 19 ) . Furthermore , by applying loading forces to the tip of the atomic force microscope , biological samples can be nanodissected to give insights into protein assembly ( 20 , 21 ) , and time - lapse AFM allows identification of structural changes of molecules as a function of time ( 22 ) . Thus , AFM is a unique tool to acquire structural information of functional multiple - protein assemblies in native membranes under physiological conditions . Methods Sample Preparation . The photosynthetic membranes of Rhodo - pseudomonas viridis were purified as described ( 23 , 24 ) . For AFM analysis , the membranes were fused by three freeze and thaw cycles . AFM . The atomic force microscope was operated as described ( 25 , 26 ) . Briefly , mica prepared as described ( 27 ) was freshly cleaved before each experiment and used as support . Membranes were adsorbed in 50 (cid:1) l of 10 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 7 . 5 (cid:1) 150 mM KCl (cid:1) 25 mM MgCl 2 . Subsequently 5 (cid:1) l of R . viridis thylakoid solution ( (cid:1) 0 . 5 mg (cid:1) ml ) were injected into the adsorption buffer drop . After 1 h the sample was rinsed with 10 volumes of high - resolution imaging buffer ( 10 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 7 . 5 (cid:1) 50 mM KCl ) . Imaging was performed with a commercial Nanoscope E contact mode atomic force microscope ( Digital Instruments , Santa Barbara , CA ) equipped with a 150 - (cid:1) m scanner ( J scanner ) with oxide - sharpened Si 3 N 4 cantilevers with a length of 100 (cid:1) m ( k (cid:2) 0 . 09 N (cid:1) m ; Olympus , Tokyo ) . The atomic force microscope was operated by applying forces of (cid:1) 100 pN . High - resolution images were recorded with optimized feedback parameters at scan frequencies of (cid:1) 5 Hz ( 1 , 000 – 2 , 000 nm (cid:1) s ) . Image Analysis . AFM images were processed by using the XMIPP single - particle analysis program package ( 28 ) . LH1 Arrangement Analysis . The lengths of the radii r were calcu - lated by using r (cid:2) (cid:2) n (cid:2) 1 16 (cid:3) (cid:3)(cid:4) x n (cid:3) X (cid:5) 2 (cid:4) (cid:4) y n (cid:3) Y (cid:5) 2 (cid:6) , where n values are subunits 1 – 16 , x n and y n are the coordinates of their peak positions , and X and Y are the coordinates of the ring center calculated by X (cid:2) (cid:2) n (cid:2) 1 16 (cid:4) x n 16 (cid:5) Abbreviations : LH , light - harvesting ; RC , reaction center ; AFM , atomic force microscopy ; 4Hcyt , tetraheme cytochrome . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Results We used an atomic force microscope ( 14 ) to investigate the photosynthetic core complex in native membranes of R . viridis under physiological conditions ( Fig . 1 a ) . The membranes were purified by a French - Press passage followed by two centrifuga - tion steps and a sucrose gradient ( 23 , 24 ) . The core complexes make (cid:7) 90 % of the total protein content in these membranes ( 8 , 23 ) . In R . viridis the RC consists of the L , M , H , and tetraheme cytochrome ( 4Hcyt ) subunits and LH1 of the (cid:5) - and (cid:6) - polypep - tides ( Fig . 1 b ) . Section analysis of overview topographs ( Fig . 1 c ) of firmly adsorbed native membranes of R . viridis result in a thickness of 124 (cid:8) 8 Å ( n (cid:2) 30 ; Fig . 1 d ) , matching with the 130 Å measured from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic surface of the RC ( ref . 11 ; see also Fig . 1 a , arrow 1 ) . Medium - resolution images revealed particles that protruded strongly from the membrane plane ( 47 . 9 (cid:8) 2 . 7 Å , n (cid:2) 35 ; Fig . 2 a ; see also Fig . 1 a , arrow 2 ) . According to x - ray crystallographic data of the RC ( 11 ) , these strongly protruding globular struc - tures were assigned to the nonmembranous 4Hcyt ( general organization depicted in Fig . 1 a ) , indicating uniform adsorption of the membranes , with their periplasmic surface exposed to the Fig . 2 .

The nanodissection ( 20 , 21 ) of the core complex yields more insight into the spatial organization between LH1 and RC in the native membrane . The number of strongly protruding complexes decreased significantly with the number of scans during high - magnification imaging ( Fig . 2 a and b ) . Comparison of subse - quently acquired high - magnification images ( 22 ) reveals topo - graphical changes of the complexes at molecular resolution ( Fig . 2 c and d ) . The strongly protruding topographies correspond to the entire core complex ( see Fig . 1 a , 4Hcyt – RC – LH1 ) . Removal of the 4Hcyt topping the RC leads to a drastic change of topography height , resulting in an RC – LH1 complex protruding 14 . 8 (cid:8) 1 . 3 Å ( n (cid:2) 34 ; Fig . 2 c and d , 1 ; see also Fig . 1 a , arrow 3 ) . Removal of the 4Hcyt – RC complex leads to an empty LH1 ring complex , which protrudes 6 . 7 (cid:8) 1 . 3 Å ( n (cid:2) 42 ; Fig . 2 c and d , 2 ) , and the tip penetrated in the ring center to a deepness of 12 . 3 (cid:8) 2 . 1 Å ( n (cid:2) 42 ) . Furthermore , one core complex revealed rotation of the RC within the LH1 in subsequently acquired images ( Fig . 2 c and d , 3 ) . High - resolution images ( Fig . 3 a ) revealed a lateral resolution of 10 Å as judged from spectral signal - to - noise analysis gained through single - particle averaging ( ref . 28 ; Fig . 3 c ) and a vertical resolution of (cid:1) 1 Å ( 26 ) . From 2 , 365 highly resolved particles , three classes of protein complexes could be extracted and averaged ( Fig . 3 ) : 1 , LH1 ; 2 , RC – LH1 ; and 3 , 4Hcyt – RC – LH1 .

The subunits show a left - handed twist to the circle outside , with lower peripheral than inner protrusions ( Fig . 3 e Left ) . This is in agreement with models built of the LH1 subunit based on the structures of LH2 ( 9 , 10 ) and electron crystallographic projec - tion maps ( 4 , 29 ) . The topography of the RC – LH1 complex reveals three important features . First , the RC shows a clearly noncentered location within the LH1 . Second , the L and M subunits are strongly asymmetrically contoured . Third , the LH1 around the RC reveals ellipticity and protrudes stronger than empty LH1 rings ( 10 . 1 (cid:8) 1 . 4 Å , n (cid:2) 32 ; Fig . 3 e , Center ; see also Fig . 1 a , arrow 4 ) . The one - sided location and asymmetric topography of the RC within LH1 is surprising , because the x - ray structure of the RC ( 11 ) shows a fairly flat surface with a quasi twofold symmetry of subunits L and M . The atomic force microscope’s topography can be explained by a tilted noncen - tered localization of the RC within the LH1 . The ellipticity and the protrusion height of the LH1 with an associated RC reflects a strong and specific interaction between the core - complex components . The complete core complex 4Hcyt – RC – LH1 ( Fig . 3 d Right ) reveals the LH1 topography and dominantly the strongly protruding 4Hcyt topping the RC . This subunit is contoured as a globular structure with a height of 48 Å over the membrane and a diameter of (cid:1) 50 Å , which might appear enlarged because of tip convolution . To analyze the LH1 subunit arrangement around the RC in detail , the center distances of the LH1 subunits and the orien - tation of the RC surface were analyzed ( Fig . 4 ; see Methods ) . The LH1 subunits of the RC – LH1 average ( Fig . 3 e Center ) are elliptically distributed around the RC ( Fig . 4 a Left ; fitted with long and short axes of a (cid:2) 52 Å and b (cid:2) 49 Å ) . The orientation of the long axis of the LH1 ellipsis coincides with the long axis of the RC topography ( Figs . 3 e Center and 4 a Left ) . The subunit distribution of the nonsymmetrized LH1 average does not reveal ellipticity ( Fig . 4 a Right ) . Individual RC – LH1 particles in one raw data image were analyzed equally ( Fig . 4 b and c ) . The subunit distribution was found to be elliptical with length differences of the long and the short axis between 5 % and 10 % . As in the average , the orientation of the long axis of the LH1 ellipsis coincides with the long axis of the RC topography . In contrast , the ellipticity is not influenced by the scan angle of the atomic force microscope , confirming that the elliptical LH1 subunit architecture is related to specific interactions with the membrane - spanning RC subunits ( Fig . 4 c ) . The ellipticity of the LH1 in complex with the RC , compared with a circular LH1 after removal of the RC ( Fig . 4 a ) , reflects adaptation of a flexible LH1 assembly to the RC position . The dominant role of the RC for the LH1 architecture is corroborated by the finding of rotation of the RC within the complex , which is not destructive to the LH1 ( Fig . 2 e , 3 ) . Such fluctuations of ellipticity of the LH1 might favor the quinone (cid:1) quinol passage through a closed LH1 architecture . Discussion In this work , the molecular organization of the core complexes has been studied in native membranes without the need of solubilization , purification , and reconstitution steps before anal - ysis . Furthermore , in the native membranes no restrictions of crystallinity are applied to the LH1 architecture and the RC within the ring . Our data clearly show that the LH1 subunits form a closed hexadecameric ellipsis assembly with a high degree of flexibility . In addition , the RC is asymmetrically contoured and closely associated to the LH1 subunits located at the short ellipsis axis . The presence of unequal bacteriochlorophyll mol - ecules in the ellipsoid is likely to influence the electronic and functional properties of LH1 as compared with a circular antenna . This may explain the presence of spectrally different pigment pools in R . viridis core complexes ( 30 ) and should result in a distribution of excitation transfer kinetics from LH1 to RC due to the different distances between the antenna bacterio - chlorophylls and the RC special pair . Besides the information on the assembly of the photosynthetic core complex , our data demonstrate that AFM , featuring an exceptionally high signal - to - noise ratio at high lateral resolution combined with the possibility to nanodissect protein assemblies , will become a key technique for the investigation of integrated photosynthetic apparatus ranging from bacteria to plants and of protein assemblies in general in native membranes .
