The A2 chain of cholera toxin ( CTX ) contains a COOH - terminal Lys - Asp - Glu - Leu ( KDEL ) se - quence . We have , therefore , analyzed by immunofluo - rescence and by subcellular fractionation in Vero cells whether CTX can be used to demonstrate a retrograde transport of KDEL proteins from the Golgi to the ER . Immunofluorescence studies reveal that after a pulse treatment with CTX , the CTX - A and B subunits ( CTX - A and CTX - B ) reach Golgi - like structures after 15 - 20 rain ( maximum after 30 min ) . Between 30 and 90 min , CTX - A ( but not CTX - B ) appear in the intermediate compartment and in the ER , whereas the CTX - B are translocated to the lysosomes . Subcellular fractionation studies confirm these results : after CTX uptake for 15 min , CTX - A is associated only with endosomal and Golgi compartments . After 30 min , a small amount of CTX - A appears in the ER in a trypsin - resistant form , and after 60 min , a significant amount appears . CTX - A seems to be transported mainly in its oxidized form ( CTX - A1 - S - S - CTX - A2 ) from the Golgi to the ER , where it becomes slowly reduced to form free CTX A1 and CTX - A2 , as indicated by experiments in which cells were homogenized 30 and 90 rain after the onset of CTX uptake in the presence of N - ethylmaleimide . No - codazol applied after accumulation of CTX in the Golgi inhibits the appearance of CTX - A in the ER and delays the increase of 3 ' , 5 ' cAMP , indicating the participation of microtubules in the retrograde Golgi - ER transport . S OON after the detection of the COOH - terminal KDEL sequence in resident soluble proteins of the ER as a retention signal ( Munro and Pelham , 1986 ) , it became evident that the KDEL sequence is a retrieval rather than a retention signal ( Munro and Pelham , 1987 ; Pelham , 1989 ) . This view was mainly based on the obser - vation that expression of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D with a COOH - terminal KDEL sequence led to the re - tention of most of the chimeric protein in the ER , but the glycan structure of the protein indicated that it had tra - versed the cis - and medium - Golgi cisternae before return - ing to the ER . Immunofluorescence ( Lewis and Pelham , 1992 ; Hsu et al . , 1992 ; Tang et al . , 1993 ; SOnnichsen et al . , 1994 ) and immunoelectronmicroscopical studies ( Tang et al . , 1993 ; Griffiths et al . , 1994 ) showed that under steady - state conditions , the KDEL receptor ERD2 exists mainly in Golgi - like structures , particularly in the cis - Golgi net - work . The affinity of the KDEL receptor for the KDEL motif is increased under the slightly acidic conditions pre - vailing in the Golgi cisternae and is decreased under the neutral pH conditions in the ER ( Wilson et al . , 1993 ) .

Tel : 49 551 392920 ; Fax : 49 551 392953 . From these observations , it was deduced that : KDEL pro - teins can escape from the ER , they are " picked up " by the KDEL receptor , they are transported back to the ER to - gether with the receptor , and are finally released in the ER . Up to now , however , the manner in which the occu - pied KDEL receptor is recycled to the ER remained un - clear . Brefeldin A ( Lippincott - Schwartz et al . , 1990 ) as well as overexpression of the KDEL receptor ( Hsu et al . , 1992 ; Townsley et al . , 1993 ) led to a change in the steady - state distribution of the KDEL receptor in favor of the ER . The overexpression of the secretory protein lysozyme fused to a COOH - terminal KDEL signal also resulted in a shift in the steady - state distribution of the KDEL receptor to the ER . None of these conditions is physiological as in - dicated , e . g . , by the fact that under these conditions , not only the KDEL receptor , but also the Golgi markers man - nosidase II and UDP - galactosyl transferase , were translo - cated from the Golgi to the ER . A possible alternative method would be to channel a KDEL protein from the outside of the cell into the Golgi , where it might interact with the KDEL receptor and sub - sequently become transported to the intermediate com - partment and to the ER . Recently , Miesenb / Sck and Roth - man ( 1995 ) have presented such an approach using a KDEL peptide linked to an antibody against c - myc - tagged © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 96 / 05 / 777 / 13 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , Number 4 , May 1996 777 - 789 777 TGN - 38 , a transmembrane protein circulating between the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) 1 and the plasma mem - brane ( Luzio et al . , 1990 ) . The KDEL peptide contained an N - glycosylation consensus sequence and was linked to the antibody by a disulfide bridge . Antibodies with the linked KDEL peptide were partially translocated to the TGN , where the peptide could be split from the antibody by treating the cells with DTI ' . The fact that some of the peptide molecules became N - glycosylated indicates that the peptide had indeed reached the ER . The approach re - quires the expression of the TGN - 38 fusion protein and treating the cells with DTT . We have applied a different approach by making use of cholera toxin ( CTX ) , which consists of an isopentameric B subunit ( CTX - B ) ( molecular mass of the protomer = 11 kD ) and a 28 . 5 - kD A subunit ( CTX - A ) ( Gill , 1976 ; Mekalanos et al . , 1983 ) . The A subunit is synthesized as a single chain but split proteolytically between serine194 and methioninet95 into the NH2 - terminal A1 subunit ( CTX - A1 ) ( molecular mass = 23 kD ) and the COOH - terminal A2 subunit ( CTX - A2 ) ( molecular mass = 5 . 5 kD ) . Both subunits re - main linked together by a disulfide bridge between cysteine187 of CTX - A1 and cysteine 5 of CTX - A2 . CTX binds to the cell surface by interaction of the B subunit with the ganglioside GM1 . The bound toxin undergoes en - docytosis ( Tran et al . , 1987 ; Sofer and Futerman , 1987 ) and reaches the Golgi ( Janicot and Desbuquois , 1987 ; Or - landi et al . , 1993 ; Nambiar et al . , 1993 ) . Although binding of CTX to the plasma membrane and internalization oc - curs very rapidly , the increase in cAMP resulting from ADP ribosylation of G ~ , by the free A1 subunit of CTX does not start earlier than 20 - 30 min after application of the toxin ( Orlandi et al . , 1993 ; Nambiar et al . , 1993 ) , indi - cating that it is highly unlikely that free CTX - A1 is re - leased from the CTX during the inital binding of the toxin to the plasma membrane . Pseudomonas exotoxin , which enters cells also by an en - docytotic pathway , becomes considerably more toxic when applied as a fusion protein with a COOH - terminal KDEL sequence ( Seetharam et al . , 1991 ) . This effect is signifi - cantly reduced in the presence of brefeldin A . Similarly , the toxicity of the ricin A chain , which is also taken up by an endosomal pathway , is strongly enhanced ( 250 - fold in Vero cells ) if it contains a COOH - terminal KDEL se - quence ( Wales et al . , 1993 ) . These results could indicate that toxins entering the cells via an endosomal pathway and possessing a COOH - terminal KDEL sequence inter - act with the KDEL receptor in the Golgi and eventually reach the ER via retrograde transport . Therefore , we have examined whether CTX or its A sub - unit can undergo retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER by means of the COOH - terminal KDEL signal of the A chain . Using CTX with Cy3 - 1abeled B subunits and spe - cific antibodies directed against the CTX - B , the CTX - A , and a peptide of CTX - A2 , and applying appropriate incu - bation and washing techniques , we show here by immuno - fluorescence studies and subcellular fractionation experi - ments that CTX - B becomes separated from CTX - A either 1 .

The released B subunit is trans - ported to the lysosomes , whereas the released CTX - A chain moves further to the intermediate compartment and to the ER . These results suggest the possibility of using CTX for studying the retrograde transport of the KDEL proteins from the Golgi to the ER and factors regulating this transport . Using this approach , we can show that treatment of Vero cells with nocodazol , given after arrival of CTX in the Golgi , strongly inhibits the transport of CTX - A from the Golgi to the ER and significantly delays the increase of cAMP . Materials and Methods Materials CTX and CTX - A subunit were obtained from List Biologicals ( Camp - bell , CA ) . CTX - B was purchased from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) and Sigma ( Munich , Germany ) .

Hille - Rehfeld ( Department of Biochemistry , University of GSttin - gen ) . The mAbs against the intermediate compartment marker p53 ( ERGIC - 53 ) and the Golgi marker giantin were kindly provided by Dr . H . P . Hauri ( Biozentrum , University of Basel , Basel , Switzerland ) . An antibody against a - tubulin was obtained from Sigma . Secondary antibodies labeled with F1TC or tetramethylrhodamine came from Dianova ( Hamburg , Germany ) . Immunofluorescence Studies Veto ceils were grown on uncoated coverslips to confluency . The ceils were washed with PBS to remove the serum and incubated for 20 rain at 0°C with 1 ~ M ganglioside GM1 dissolved in DME without FCS . After prebinding of GM1 , the medium was removed and the culture dishes were placed on a thick metal plate that bad been cooled to 0°C . The cells were then incubated for 20 min at 0°C with FCS - free DME containing 0 . 1 ixg / ml of CTX or Cy3 - 1abeled CTX ( only B subunit labeled ) to allow binding of the toxin to the plasma membranes . Subsequently , the sample was warmed for 5 rain to 37 ~ C to start internalization of CTX . To remove as much free CTX as possible , the cells were rapidly washed three times with PBS containing 1 ~ M ganglioside GM1 . After the addition of DME with 10 % FCS , the incubation was continued in an incubator ( 5 % CO2 ) at 37 ~ C . At the time points indicated , the coverslips were removed and the cells were fixed in 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde / 2 % paraformaldehyde for 10 rain on ice and for 20 rain at room temperature to prevent toxin translocation during fixation . Free aldehyde groups were blocked with 50 mM NI ~ CI followed by permeabilization with I ) . 15 % ( wt / vol ) saponine in blocking medium ( PBS / 0 . 2 % ( wt / vol ) gelatin ) . This was fo ) / owed by incubation with the first antibody for 30 min at 37°C in the prrsence of blocking me - dium . After washing and incubation with the second antibody for 30 rain at room temperature , cells were mounted in Moviol 4 - 88 ( Hoechst , Frank - fuel , Germany ) and dried overflight . Epifluoreseence was detected using an Axiovert microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thormwood , NY ) with a Plan - Neofluar ×100 / 1 . 30 objective . When Cy3 - 1abeled CI ~ was used , ceils were treated and fixed in the same way , but the time - dependent changes in the dis - tribution of CTX - B were followed by directly measuring Cy3 - fluorescence . In the experiments where nocodazol was used , the cells were first incu - bated with 0 . 1 p . g / ml CTX for 30 rain as described above to allow for accu - mulation of CTX in the Golgi . 10 p . g / ml nocodazol ( final concentration ) was then added , and the incubation continued for the indicated times ~ fol - lowed by fixation and immunofluorescence analysis as described above . SubeeUular Fractionation Incubation of Vero cells with CTX was performed as described above for the immunotluorescence studies , except that the cells were grown to 90 % confiuency in 145 - cm z plastic petri dishes ( Greiner , NUrtingen , Germany ) in DME / 10 % FCS . The pretreatment with GM1 and the incubation with CTX were performed as described above for the immunofluorescence studies , except that the concentration of CTX was 0 . 5 p . g / ml . At the time points given in the figure legends , the dishes were cooled on ice , the me - dium was removed , and the ceils were washed with ice - cold PBS . The cells were removed with a rubber policeman in the presence of removing me - dium ( 140 mM NaCI , 25 mM Tris - HC1 , 30 mM KCI , 10 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) . After the replacement of the removing medium by homogenization medium ( 130 mM KCI , 25 mM NaCI , 25 mM Tris , I mM EGTA ) , the cells were homogenized by pushing them three times each through 22G , 24G , and 27G injection needles , respectively . The homogenates were spun for 10 rain at 1 , 000 g . The supernatant was spun for 10 min at 3 , 000 g , and the resulting supernatant was layered on top of a step gradient consisting of 1 ml each of 30 , 25 , 20 , 15 , 12 . 5 , 10 , 7 . 5 , 5 and 2 . 5 % ( vol / vol ) iodixanol in homogenization buffer . After centrifugation at 126 , 000 g ~ v for 25 rain ( SW 40 . 1 rotor ; Beckman Instruments , Palo Alto , CA ) , I0 fractions were col - lected from the top of the gradient and analyzed for density , protein ( Bradford , 1976 ) , as well as the enzymatic activities of UDP - galactosyl - transferase ( Verdon and Berger , 1983 ) , rotenone - insensitive NADH - cyto - chrome C reductase ( Sottocasa et al . , I967 ) , and 3 - hexosaminidase ( Hall et al . , 1978 ) . To separate the particulate fractions from soluble proteins , 0 . 5 ml of each fraction was diluted with PBS and spun for 2 h at 100 , 000 gay - The resulting sediments were dissolved in Laemmli mix ( Laemmli , 1970 ) under nonreducing or reducing ( 50 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol plus 50 mM DTr ) conditions and analyzed by SDS - PAGE ( 16 % gels ) using a mul - fiphasic buffer system according to the method of Wiltfang et aL ( 1991 ) to detect free CTX - A2 . Only the samples processed under reducing condi - tions were heated in the Laemmli mix before electrophoresis . In some ex - periments , the homogenization medium contained 5 mM NEM to alkylate GSH and other sulfhydryl metabolites that could potentially lead to a cleavage of the CTX - A - sulfhydryl bridge , Biotinylation of Plasma Membranes CTX uptake was started as described above for the subcellular fraction - ation studies . 60 rain after the initiation of CTX uptake , the ceils were cooled on ice , washed with ice - cold PBS , and incubated for 10 rain at 0 ~ C with 0 . 1 mg / ml NHS - LC - biotin in PBS . Then the medium was removed , and remaining reactive NHS - LC - biotin was blocked by addition of 100 mM Tris - Cl , pH 8 . The ceils were subsequently homogenized and fractionated by iodixanol density gradient centrifugation as described above . Aliquots of the fractions were diluted and spun for I h at 100 , 000gay . The sediments were processed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting using streptavidin - peroxidase for detection . Trypsin Digestion Ceils were allowed to take up CTX as described above for 120 rain . They were then homogenized and separated by iodixanol gradient centrifuga - lion as described . The fractions containing the peak concentrations of cal - reticulin and CTX - A were diluted and sedimented by centrifugation for 2 h at 100 , 000 g . The sediment was resuspended in 130 mM KCI , 20 mM NaC1 , 20 mM sucrose , 25 mM Hepes NaOH , 1 mM Mg acetate , pH 7 . 4 ( medium R ) containing 1 mM tetracaine for membrane stabilization . After another centrifugation , the sediments were again resuspended in medium R and incubated for 10 rain at 30° ( 2 without further addition , or with 30 ~ g / ml trypsin in the absence or presence of 1 % ( vol / vol ) Triton X - 100 . The sam - ples were suspended in Laemmli mix without reducing agents and were analyzed without previous heating by nonreducing SDS - PAGE . Determination of 3 ' , 5 ' - cAMP cAMP was measured by an ELISA according to the recommendations of the manufacturer ( Amersham - Buchler Co . ; code RPN 225 ) . Results lmmunofluorescence Studies with Complete Cholera Toxin To exclude the possibility that the uptake of CTX was lim - ited by the number of binding sites in the pIasma mem - branes , the cells had been preincubated with the ganglio - side GM1 . Since the main goal of the present studies was the transport of CTX within the retrograde secretory pathway , it was not studied whether the preincubation with GM1 accelerated or increased the cAMP response . The washing of the cells with a medium containing GM1 after binding and short internalization of CTX proved to be important for obtaining a clear time - dependent movement of CTX subunits through the different intracellular compartments . After 5 - 10 min of incubation with CTX at 37°C , the toxin ( A and B subunits ) can be observed in association with plasma membranes ( Fig . 2 , a and b ) . At this time , im - munopositive small vesicular structures and early staining of Golgi - like structures are also found ( Fig . 2 a ) . After 20 - 30 rain , a distinct accumulation of CTX - A ( Fig . 2 c ) in the Golgi occurs , as indicated by the colocalization with the ERD2 protein ( Fig . 2 , c and d ) . At this time , a colocaliza - tion of CTX - A with the ER marker calreticulin is hardly detectable ( Fig . 3 , a - c ) . If the incubation is extended fur - Majoul et al .

After 10 min of uptake , significant portions of CTX - A and CTX - B are still associated with the plasma membrane , as detected by the fluorescence of the Cy3 - 1abeled B - subunit ( a ) or by a Cy5 labeled anti - CTX - A - directed antibody ( b ) . After 30 rain , most of the toxin ( as detected with the anti - CTX - A2 peptide antibody ) has accumulated in Golgi - like structures ( c ) , as indicated by the coloealization with the KDEL receptor ERD - 2 ( d ) . 45 rain after initiation of CTX uptake , CTX - A was no longer restricted to Golgi - like structures ( e ) , but it partially coloealized with the ERGIC marker p53 ( f ) .

At this stage , CTX - A partially colocalizes with p53 , a marker for the intermediate com - partment ( Schweizer et al . , 1988 ) ( Fig . 2 , e and f ) . After 60 - 90 min , most of the CTX - A appears in a reticular struc - ture that colocalizes with the ER marker calreticulin ( Fig . 3 , d - C ) . During the early phase of CTX uptake , the transport of the B subunit parallels that of the A subunit . 10 rain after initiation of uptake , CTX - B is observed on the plasma mem - brane and in punctuated structures that most likely repre - sent endosomes ( Fig . 4 a ) . At 20 min , CTX - B starts to ac - cumulate in perinuclear structures ( Fig . 4 b ) . At 30 min , significant amounts of CTX - B colocalize with the Golgi marker giantin ( Linstedt and Hauri , 1993 ) ( Fig . 4 , c and d ) , but CTX - B appears also in punctuated structures scattered throughout the cell ( Fig . 4 c ) . At 90 min , when CTX - A exhibits a reticular distribution ( Fig . 3 , d - f ) , CTX - B still resides to a large extent in perinuclear compartments ( Fig . 4 e ) , but also in more punctuated structures that colocalize with the lysosomal marker cathepsin D ( Fig . 4 3 ' ) . Clearly , CTX - A does not colocalize with cathepsin D ( Fig . 4 , g and h ) . Thus , it appears that CTX - A and CTX - B become sepa - rated in the late endosomes or the TGN , from where the A subunits are further translocated via retrograde trans - port to the ER while B subunits are channeled into the ly - sosomes . SubceUular Fractionation The distribution of marker enzymes after iodixanol gradi - ent centrifugation of the 3 , 000 - g supernatant shows a rea - sonable separation of the Golgi fractions ( as represented by UDP - galactosyltransferase ) from the ER fractions ( as represented by rotenone - insensitive NADH cytochrome C reductase ) and calreticulin ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . Fractions 8 and 9 containing most of the ER markers were almost free of contamination with lysosomes . Fractions 8 and 9 to - gether contained only , - ~ 2 . 5 % of total N - acetylhexosamini - dase activity . Most of the [ 3 - hexosaminidase activity was found in the pellet fraction , and some activity was also found in the three top fractions of the gradient . The bio - tinylation experiments indicate further that the plasma membrane fractions band in the three to four top fractions of the gradient , and that the fractions representing ER , indicated by the distribution of the KDEL protein calre - ticulin , are free of contaminating plasma membranes ( Fig . 6 ) . The last two lanes in Fig . 6 also show that when the 1 , 000 g supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 3 , 000 g , a large amount of biotinylated material could still be sedi - mented .

Cells were analyzed 15 and 60 min after initiation of up - take of CTX for the distribution of CTX - A in the gradient by using the anti - CTX - A2 peptide antibody ( Fig . 7 ) . After 15 min , CTX - A appears in a nonreducing gel with an ap - parent molecular mass of ~ 28 . 5 kD and mainly in the first four to five fractions representing plasma membranes , en - dosomes , and Golgi ( Fig . 7 a ) . Clearly , the ER fractions , as represented by the distribution of rotenone - insensitive NADH cytochrome C reductase , are almost free of detect - able amounts of CTX - A . At 60 rain , however , the nonre - ducing gel shows CTX - A distributed all over the gradient with maxima in fractions 3 - 5 and fractions 8 and 9 ( Fig . 7 b ) . It runs with an apparent molecular mass of ~ 28 . 5 kD , indicating that even the ER contains unsplit CTX - A . Un - der the same conditions , the CTX - B remains associated mainly with the uppermost four fractions of the gradient and does not appear in the ER fractions ( Fig . 7 c ) . In contrast to the experiments shown in Fig . 7 , where an antibody directed against a peptide from CTX - A2 was used , the antibody used in the experiments shown in Figs . 8 and 9 reacted with CTX - A as well as with CTX - A1 and CTX - A2 . Fig . 8 indicates that 120 min after the beginning of CTX uptake , free CFX - A1 and CTX - A2 existed in the ER . To exclude the possibility that this reflects an artifact resulting from the leakage of sulfhydryl metabolites ( e . g . , reduced glutathione , cysteine , cysteamine ) into the ER during the homogenization and fractionation procedure , we have performed experiments in which the homogeniza - tion medium contained 5 mM NEM ( Fig . 9 ) . The experi - ments were otherwise performed as described in Fig . 7 . The fractions were analyzed by nonreducing SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting using the antibody applied also in Fig . 8 . After CTX uptake for 30 min , CTX - A , but only traces of CTX - A1 , could be detected mainly in the Golgi fractions . Some CTX - A had already reached the ER ( as indicated by the position of calreticulin in the gradient , Fig . 9 a ) , but CTX - A1 could not be detected in this com - partment ( Fig . 9 b ) . After 90 min , a considerable portion of CTX - A had moved to the ER fractions , now accompa - nied by CTX - A1 as well as by CTX - A2 ( Fig . 9 c ) . The mi - nor amounts of sedimentable CTX - A1 and CTX - A2 in the upper fractions most likely resulted from smaller vesicles generated from broken ER cisternae , as indicated by the traces of calreticulin ( Fig . 9 a ) migrating with the same Figure 4 .

A comparison of the distribution of CTX - B at 90 rain after initiation of CTX uptake ( e ) with that of cathepsin D ( f ) indicates that at this time point , a significant portion of CTX - B had reached the lysosomes . At the same time point , CTX - A ( as as - sessed with a CTX - A2 peptide antibody preadsorbed with CTX - B ; Fig . 4 g ) showed little colocalization with cathepsin D ( Fig . 4 h ) , but was mainly distributed in reticular structures most likely representing ER ( compare with Fig . 3 ) .

The 3 , 000 - g super - natant was loaded onto an iodixanol gradient and spun for 25 min at 126 , 000 gay as described in Fig . 6 . The fractions were diluted , sedimented by centrifugation at 100 , 000 gmax for 60 min , and the pellets were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . After blotting , biotinylated proteins were detected with streptavidin - peroxidase ( a ) . Lanes A and B represent the 3 , 000 - g and 1 , 000 - g sediments , respectively . Note that the 3 , 000 - g sediment still contains significant amounts of biotinylated proteins . ( b ) The distribution of the ER marker calreticulin . Note that some calreticulin moves with the lighter fraction . This represents small ER vesicles generated during cell homogenization . fractions . These results indicate that after separation from CTX - B , some CTX - A becomes reduced in the secretory pathway , most likely in the ER . Clearly , CTX - A existed inside the ER vesicles since CTX - A , CTX - A1 , and CTX - A2 remained resistant to digestion with trypsin as long as the vesicles were not opened by detergents ( Fig . 8 ) . After treatment with Triton X - 100 , the ER marker calreticulin and CTX - A1 , but little CTX - A and CTX - A2 , became di - gested by trypsin . Since free CTX - A is very sensitive to trypsin digestion in vitro ( result not shown here ) , we con - clude that the interactions of CTX - A and the CTX - A2 , but not of CTX - A1 , with components of the ER protected them from trypsin digestion . In these experiments , the cells had been homogenized 120 min after initiation of CTX uptake , i . e . , 60 min later than in the experiment shown in Fig . 7 b . This may explain why A2 subunits could be detected under nonreducing conditions in Fig . 8 , but not in Fig . 7 b . Time - dependent Increase of 3 ' , 5 ' - cAMP The concentrations of 3 ' , Y - cAMP did not start to in - crease until 20 min after the beginning of CTX uptake ( Fig . 10 ) . A strong increase began only after 30 min , at which time the first CTX - A subunits had already left the Golgi . These results agree with previous data , which also Figure 7 . Distribution of CTX - A and CTX - B after iodixanol gra - dient centrifugation . Distribution of CTX subunits after CTX up - take for 15 min ( a ) or 60 rain ( b and c ) . The initial CTX concen - tration was 0 . 5 ixg / ml . Vero cells were homogenized 15 min after initiation of CTX uptake . The 3 , 000 - g supernatant was prepared , loaded onto an iodixanol gradient , and centrifuged as described in Fig . 6 . The fractions were diluted , spun at 100 , 000 g for 60 min , and the sediments were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immuno - blotting using the CTX - A2 - specific antibody ( a and b ) or a CTX - B - specific antibody ( c ) . The samples in a and b were processed by nonreducing SDS - PAGE without heat treatment of the Laemrnli mix ; the sample in c was heated and developed by electrophoresis under reducing conditions . Note that at the early time point ( a ) under the condition of nonreducing electrophoresis of nonheated samples , undissociated CTX could be observed in the first frac - tions of the gradient , which had disappeared at the later time point ( 60 rain , b ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , 1996 784 Figure 8 . Trypsin resistance of CTX - A in the ER . Vero cells were treated with CTX as described in Fig . 7 , except that the cells were homogenized 120 min instead of 60 min after the initiation of CTX uptake . The gradient fraction with the highest content of calreticulin was diluted , and the vesicles were sedimented by cen - trifugation at 100 , 000 g for 60 min . The sediment was resus - pended and divided into three equal portions . The first portion was directly developed by SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions ( lane A ) , the second was first treated with trypsin ( lane B ) , and the third ( lane C ) was first treated with Triton X - 100 followed by trypsin treatment . The positions of calreticulin ( 60 kD ) , CTX - A ( 28 . 5 kD ) , CTX - A1 ( 23 kD ) , and CTX - A2 ( 5 . 5 kD ) have been marked . Note that calreticulin and CTX - A1 became digested af - ter treatment with Triton X - 100 , whereas CTX - A and CTX - A2 remained almost resistant to the action of trypsin , even in the presence of Triton X - 100 . showed a delayed response of 3 ' , 5 ' - cAMP levels after CTX application ( Orlandi et al . , 1993 ; Nambiar et al . , 1993 ) . Effects of Nocodazol on Retrograde Transport of the CTX - A Subunit Nocodazol was applied at a time point ( 30 min ) when most of the CTX had accumulated in Golgi compartments ( see Fig . 3 ) . After 20 min of nocodazol treatment ( 50 min after the initiation of CTX internalization ) , intact microtubules had disappeared ( Fig . 11 , a and c ) , and the compact Golgi structure ( as indicated by the distribution of ERD2 ) had undergone fragmentation to smaller vesicular structures dispersed throughout the cells ( Fig . 11 , b and d ) . At this time point , CTX - A was largely found in fragmented struc - tures similar to ERD2 ( Fig . 11 , f - h ) . 90 min after the initi - ation of CTX uptake ( 60 min after the addition of nocoda - zol ) , some CTX - A still colocalized with the fragmented Golgi although the majority of CTX - A appeared in punc - tuated structures distributed throughout the cell ( Figs . 11 , i and j ) . In summary , these results show that nocodazol in - hibits the transport of CTX - A out of the Golgi , but is un - able to completely block its exit from this compartment . Apparently , the effective translocation of CTX - A from the ERD2 - positive ( Golgi ) compartment to the ER re - quires intact microtubuli . This would be in line with previ - ous data of Lippincott - Schwartz et al . ( 1990 ) , who demon - Figure 9 . Formation of CTX - A1 and CTX - A2 in the ER . Vero cells were incubated with CTX as described in Fig . 7 . 30 min ( b ) and 90 min ( c ) after initiation of CTX , uptake cells were homoge - nized as in Fig . 7 , except that the homogenizing medium con - tained 5 mM NEM . The homogenate was spun at 3 , 000 g , and the supernatant was analyzed by iodixanol gradient centrifugation as described in Figs . 5 - 7 . The fractions from the iodixanol gradient were diluted and spun at 100 , 000 g for i h . The sediments were suspended in Laemmli mix without heating and were analyzed by nonreducing SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting using an antibody against calreticulin ( a ) or an antibody against CTX - A that re - acted with CTX - A , CTX - A1 , and CTX - A2 ( b and c ) . Note the appearance of some calreticulin together with some CTX - A1 and CTX - A2 in the lighter fractions resulting from breakage of ER into smaller vesicles . strated the involvement of microtubules in the brefeldin A - induced " backtransport " of Golgi enzymes to the ER , as well as the further dependence of this phenomenon on kinesin ( Lippincott - Schwartz et al . , 1995 ) . Effects of Nocodazol on the Level of 3 ' , 5 ' cAMP Nocodazol given 30 min after the initiation of CTX uptake led to a significant delay of cAMP increase at 40 rain ( Fig . 12 ) . After 90 min , however , cAMP levels again achieved similar levels as those measured in cells that were not treated with nocodazol . This agrees well with the immu - nofluorescence results ( Fig . 11 ) , which show that the de - struction of microtubules delays the transport of CTX - A out of the Golgi - like structures , but that CTX - A eventu - ally leaves these structures and arrives in more reticular compartments ( Fig . 11 , i and j ) . Discussion The approach used here permits the monitoring of the in - tracellular transport of CTX . This was possible by intro - ducing a short period of CTX internalization followed by more or less complete removal of noninternalized CTX by washing the cells with a GMl - containing medium . Our studies do not permit conclusions as to the internalization Majoul et al .

It has been reported that after binding to the ganglioside GM1 in the plasma membrane , CTX becomes internalized via noncoated vesicles ( Tran et al . , 1987 ) , pos - sibly via caveoli ( Parton , 1994 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ) , but other mechanisms have been proposed as well ( Sorer and Futer - man , 1995 ) . In any case , starting ~ 15 min after internaliza - tion , CTX - A and CTX - B appear in the TGN or Golgi compartments , initially as the holotoxin , but later as sepa - rated CTX - B and CTX - A , as indicated by measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the two subunits ( Bastiaens et al . , 1996 ) . At later time points ( 60 - 90 min after the initiation of CTX uptake ) , a consider - able portion of CTX - B colocalizes with the lysosomal marker cathepsin D ( Fig . 4 ) , indicating that it had been transported from late endosomes or the TGN to the lyso - somes . CTX - B was not observed in the ER at any time point , in accordance with the data of Sandvig et al . ( 1994 ) , who observed that in A431 cells , CTX - B was taken up by endocytosis and transported to the Golgi , but did not move further to the ER , even under conditions ( pretreat - ment of the cells with butyric acid ) leading to the translo - cation of the Shiga toxin B chain to the ER . Since CTX - B was labeled with Cy3 in the immunofluorescence studies ( Fig . 4 ) , even proteolytic fragments of CTX - B reaching the intermediate compartment or the ER should have been detected by immunofluorescence . The appearance of CTX in the Golgi is in line with previous reports ( Janicot and Desbuquois , 1987 ; Orlandi et al . , 1993 ; Nambiar et al . , 1993 ) , although these studies do not address the question of a retrograde transport of CTX subunits beyond the Golgi . With respect to the fate of CTX - A , it is important to note that when CTX clearly had already reached the Golgi ( 10 - 20 min ) , the concentration of cAMP remained almost unchanged . The accumulation of CTX - A in the Golgi reached its maximum ~ , , 30 min after the initiation of CTX uptake . Thereafter , visible amounts of CTX - A start to leave the Golgi and appear in " downstream " compart - ments that can be identified as the p53 compartment ( in - termediate compartment , ERGIC Schweizer et al . , 1988 ) and the ER . At the present time , it remains unclear whether CTX - A is first transported to the p53 compart - ment and then to the ER , or whether most of the CTX - A is transported directly to the ER and a smaller portion to the p53 compartment . In any case , the immunofluores - cence studies and the gradient centrifugation experiments showed that CTX - A reached the ER after 60 - 90 min . The main increase of cAMP levels started after 30 min and did not reach its maximum until 90 min . This observation sup - ports the assumption that an effective ADP ribosylation of Gs ~ requires the previous transport of CTX - A from the Golgi to downstream compartments , from where it must be released into the cytoplasm by mechanisms that are still unknown . The small increase in cAMP levels at 30 min does not conflict with this view , since small amounts of CTX - A had reached the ER already at this time point ( see Fig . 9 b ) . Although we cannot exclude that some CTX - A mole - cules leave the secretory pathway at the level of the Golgi , it appears from our results , including those obtained with nocodazol , that transport into the cytoplasm from the down - stream compartments ( intermediate compartment , ER ) is more effective . This would also agree with the results that show that Pseudomonas exotoxin ( Seetharam et al . , 1991 ) and ricin A chain ( Sandvig et al . , 1994 ) , which are also in - ternalized via an endocytic route , become much more toxic if they contain a COOH - terminal KDEL sequence that presumably facilitates their retrograde transport to the ER . These data seem to be in conflict with recent data of Cieplak et al . ( 1995 ) . These authors replaced the COOH - terminal RDEL sequence in Escherichia coli heat - labile enterotoxin by RDGL , RDEV , or LEDR , and mea - sured the effects of these changes on the cellular elonga - tion of CliO - K1 cells or on cAMP levels in Caco - 2 cells . They concluded that the changes of the COOH - terminal tetrapeptide had no significant effects on these parame - ters . In the experiments with CliO - K1 cells , however , the effect on the morphology was evaluated after the cells had been exposed to the toxins for 36 - - 48 h . This time interval is certainly too long to evaluate the facilitating effect of the RDEL sequence . In the experiments with Caco - 2 cells , none of the toxin constructs led to a significant increase of cAMP until 30 min . At 60 and 120 rain , the wild - type toxin clearly induced significantly higher cAMP increases than the mutant toxins . Therefore , a functional role of the COOH - terminal KDEL sequence of the A2 subunit of CTX or the RDEL seqRence of the A subunit of E . coli heat - labile enterotoxin cannot be excluded on the basis of the data presented by Cieplak et al . ( 1995 ) . The protease digestion experiments , as well as the cell fractionation experiments in the presence of NEM , show that after 90 and 120 rain , not only intact CTX - A , but also The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 133 , 1996 786 Figure 11 .

Nocodazol treatment delays the increase of 3 ' , 5 ' - cAMP levels . The experiments were performed as described in Fig . 11 . At the indicated times after initiation of CTX uptake , cells were analyzed for 3 ' , 5 ' - cAMP . Controls were treated only with CTX . Mean values + _ SD from three separate experiments each point measured in duplicate . CTX - A1 and CTX - A2 , exist in the ER . The conditions of the NEM experiments were such that all reducing metabo - lites like reduced glutathione , cysteine , or cysteamine should have become alkylated during the homogenization proce - dure , so that it seems highly unlikely that CTX - A in the secretory pathway had undergone reduction of its disulfide bridge caused by the influx of reducing metabolites during the homogenization and separation processes . Therefore , the question remains : Where and how does the reduction of CTX - A in the secretory pathway occur ? The redox con - ditions in the ER , where disulfide bridge formation in newly synthetized secretory proteins takes place , is not very favorable for disulfide bridge reduction ( reduced glu - tathione / oxidized glutathione GSH / GSSG ratio ~ 1 Hwang et al . , 1993 ) as compared to the GSH / GSSG ratio in the cytoplasm , which amounts to 20 - 100 . Both CTX - A as well as CTX - A1 coexist in the ER . It is not yet clear whether the toxic effect ( ADP ribosylation of Gs ~ ) is ex - erted by CTX - A1 generated in the secretory pathway or by CTX - A1 produced in the cytoplasm from CTX - A . The fact that CTX - A and CTX - A2 are much more resistant to trypsin digestion in the presence of Triton X - 100 than CTX - A1 ( Fig . 8 ) could indicate a preferential interaction of CTX - A and CTX - A2 with the phospholipid bilayer of the ER . Such an interaction could also mean that CTX - A becomes more easily translocated from the ER cisternae to the cytosol than does CTX - A1 . The time - dependent transport of holo - CTX - A allows the study of the backtransport of a KDEL protein from the Golgi to the ER without the dramatic intracellular changes observed during overexpression of the KDEL re - ceptor ( Hsu et al . , 1992 ; Townsley et al . , 1993 ) , overex - pression of secretory proteins with a COOH - terminal KDEL sequence ( Lewis and Pelham , 1992 ) , or treatment with brefeldin A ( Hsu et al . , 1992 ) . Our approach is similar to that used by Miesenb0ck and Rothman ( 1995 ) in that it uses an indicator molecule applied to the cells from the outside to study Golgi - ER backtransport , but it is less complicated . Moreover , it allows the monitoring of the transport ' s time course . This opens the possibility for iden - tifying components involved in discrete transport steps , es - pecially in combination with microinjection techniques . In a first application of the method , we have studied the ef - fect of nocodazol on the Golgi - ER backtransport of the KDEL protein CTX - A . This effect of nocodazol could be discriminated from effects of the drug on earlier transport steps by applying it only after CTX - A , the transport indi - cator , had reached the Golgi . The results dearly show that disruption of the microtubules inhibits the Golgi - ER backtransport and delays the increase of cAMP . A partici - pation of microtubules in the retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER would be in agreement with earlier observations of Lippincott - Schwartz et al . ( 1990 ) that were obtained in experiments with brefeldin A . We have now started to study factors involved in the Golgi - ER backtransport of KDEL proteins using the ap - proach described here .
