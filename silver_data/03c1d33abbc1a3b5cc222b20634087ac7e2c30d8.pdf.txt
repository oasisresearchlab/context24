Robinson 1 + 1 Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden , and 2 The University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada Movement is a defining characteristic of life . Macroscopic motion is driven by the dynamic interactions of myosin with actin filaments in muscle . Directed polymerization of actin behind the advancing membrane of a eukaryotic cell generates microscopic movement . Despite the fundamental importance of actin in these processes , the structure of the actin filament remains unknown . The Holmes model of the actin filament was published 15 years ago , and although it has been widely accept - ed , no high - resolution structural data have yet confirmed its veracity . Here , we review the implications of recently deter - mined structures of F - actin - binding proteins for the structure of the actin filament and suggest a series of in silico tests for actin - filament models . We also review the significance of these structures for the arp2 / 3 - mediated branched filament .

These actin structures may be classified as ‘open’ ( Fig 1B ) , as observed in a profilin : actin structure ( Chik et al , 1996 ) , or ‘closed’ , as is seen for all others ( Fig 1A ) , including a form of profilin : actin ( Schutt et al , 1993 ) . Actin consists of four subdomains that are arranged in pairs ( Fig 1A – C ) that sandwich the nucleotide and a metal ion . Minor differences can be seen between closed - form structures , which are most apparent in the conformation of a loop of subdomain 2 ( D - loop ) and slight variations in the angle between the two halves of actin . In the open form , subdomain 2 rotates away from subdomain 4 to open the nucleotide - binding cleft and leave a clear path for nucleotide exchange . Although the large number of known structures that have the closed con - formation clearly suggest it to be the structure of the monomer , we should examine the set of structures in question and consider that most of the agents used to stabilize them also affect nucleotide exchange . With the exception of profilin , these agents inhibit nucleotide exchange probably by narrowing the nucleotide - binding cleft , and thus lock actin in the closed form . Therefore , the structure of the actin monomer in isolation is not known with absolute certainty . It may oscillate between the well - defined closed form and more open forms , such as the profilin : actin open structure , in order to exchange nucleotide ( that is , move from the structure presented in Fig 1C through to that in Fig 1B and onto the one in Fig 1A in order to replace ADP with ATP ) . Despite uncertainties in the structure of the isolated actin monomer , we know the structures of profilin : actin ( Chik et al , 1996 ; Schutt et al , 1993 ) and have a good idea of the Wiscott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) homology 2 domain ( WH2 ) : actin structure . These are the biologically relevant forms of the actin monomer that are used by cells to feed filament elongation . Do we know the structure of the actin filament ? Before addressing this issue , our definition of the term ‘structure’ should be established . Protein – protein interactions occur on a scale that requires the precise positioning of individual atoms at the inter - action interface . Protein crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) can be used to determine structures at such a reso - lution . Methods that do not afford the appropriate resolution , or that lack certainty in their interpretation , produce three - dimensional representations that are designated as models rather than structures . 1 Department ofMedical Biochemistry and Microbiology , Uppsala Biomedical Center , Uppsala University , Uppsala 751 23 , Sweden 2 Department ofChemistry and Centre for Blood Research , The University ofBritish Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia V6T 1Z1 , Canada + Corresponding author .

So , the answer is “No” , we do not know the structure of the actin filament , but we do have several models . These models include the Holmes fibre - diffraction model ( Holmes closed model ; Holmes et al , 1990 ) ; the Egelman electron microscopy reconstruction model ( Belmont et al , 1999 ) , which is a Holmes - like model that comprises open - cleft actin protomers ( Holmes - like open model ) ; and the unrelated ribbon - to - helix hypothesis that is based on actin : actin crystal contacts within profilin : actin crystals ( Schutt et al , 1993 ) .

H . Aguda et al 222 Given that we do not know the structure of the filament , can the database of known actin monomer structures be used to dis - tinguish the best filament models ? Recently , several actin monomer structures have been determined involving proteins that are also able to interact with actin filaments . Some members of the WH2 family of proteins release their bound actin monomer during polymerization , and at least one , ciboulot , is able to cap the pointed end of the filament ( Fig 1D ; Hertzog et al , 2004 ; Irobi et al , 2004 ) . Gelsolin is able to cap , sever and nucleate actin fila - ments and , under in vitro conditions , form complexes with actin monomers ( Fig 1E , F ; Burtnick et al , 2004 ; Robinson et al , 1999 ) . Bni1 FH2 is able to nucleate and processively elongate actin fila - ments ( Fig 1G ; Otomo et al , 2005 ) . Arp2 / 3 is a complex of seven proteins that includes two subunits , arp2 and arp3 , each of which resembles actin in structure ( Fig 1H ; Robinson et al , 2001 ) . The two arps are thought to adopt a filament - like orientation in order to act as the first two subunits in the arp2 / 3 branched daughter filament . If we assume that the interactions of these filament - binding proteins with actin , or with the arps , will be similar to a first approximation , whether they are bound to a monomer or to a filament , these structures have relevance in the evaluation of actin filament models . However , it should be noted that at least two conformational changes are expected in the actin monomer struc - ture on incorporation into a filament . The first , which occurs immediately on addition of actin monomers to filaments , is evinced by the release of profilin and the increased rate of ATP hydrolysis ( Blanchoin & Pollard , 2002 ) . The second , which fol - lows hydrolysis of ATP and the release of phosphate , is seen by the preference of many filament - binding proteins for filaments that bear a particular nucleotide . Furthermore , many actin - binding proteins , including gelsolin , are known to cause conformational changes in the filament ( Orlova et al , 1995 ) . Hence , in the analy - ses below , we allow moderate conformational changes in the actin – protomer structure and also permit small changes in the protomer orientation . Interactions across the filament Gelsolin , ciboulot and arp2 / 3 are able to cap actin filaments , and gelsolin , Bni1 FH2 and arp2 / 3 can nucleate filaments ( Burtnick et al , 2001 ; Dayel & Mullins , 2004 ; Hertzog et al , 2002 ; Otomo et al , 2005 ) . Therefore , the actin - monomer - bound forms of ciboulot , gelsolin and FH2 must allow for the formation of actin : actin con - tacts across the filament , while obscuring the appropriate filament end . Similarly , within the arp2 / 3 complex , the interactions of the accessory proteins with arp2 and arp3 should allow arp2 and arp3 to adopt an orientation appropriate to an actin filament . Superposition of the actin structures from the G1 – G3 , G4 – G6 , FH2 and the WH2 domain actin complexes , and overlaying arp2 and arp3 onto actin with their accessory proteins P40 , P16 and P20 , and P21 and P34 , respectively , provides a picture of the exter - nal face of an actin filament ( Fig 2A – D ) . These filament - binding proteins extensively cover one face and the two sides of an actin protomer , while leaving its opposite face free . The unobscured face represents the surface that is available for actin – actin interactions across the filament and provides the first test of validity for the fila - ment models . In the Holmes - like models , the actin – actin inter - action footprint is buried in the cross - filament interactions ( Fig 2D ) , which satisfies this test . By default , models that are grossly different to the Holmes model are contrary to this analysis . Biology of the interacting proteins Relations between the structures and biology of the F - actin - binding proteins that are discussed above provide further tests for models of the actin filament . The WH2 motif superfamily includes the β - thymosin subfamily , members of which sequester actin monomers and do not directly release them for filament elongation . The WH2 domain structures show that the two termini of thymosin - β 4 are able to hinder its inclusion at either the barbed or the pointed end of a Holmes - like filament ( Hertzog et al , 2004 ; Irobi et al , 2004 ) . Two modifications exist that turn the sequestering β - thymosin into the more general WH2 barbed - end elongating module . First , the car - boxyl terminus is shortened or its actin binding is impaired to allow inclusion of WH2 : actin at the barbed end of the filament ( Hertzog et al , 2004 ) . Second , proteins that contain many WH2 motifs are consis - tent with decorating neighbouring actin subunits on one face of the Holmes - like models , and during elongation may deliver actin monomers to the barbed end ( Irobi et al , 2004 ) . When the structures of the two halves of gelsolin bound to actin are superimposed onto the Holmes closed model of the filament , steric clashes occur that involve gelsolin domains G1 and G4 with the neighbouring longitudinally associated actin protomers , in line with the capping function of these domains ( Burtnick et al , 2004 ) . Furthermore , G2 , the F - actin - binding domain , is orientated with respect to a third actin to allow their predicted binding surfaces to come together ( Choe et al , 2002 ; Puius et al , 2000 ) . Hence , the Holmes - like models show no disparity with the gelsolin structures . The Bni1 FH2 : actin structure provides a powerful indication as to the mechanisms of nucleation , capping and elongation by the FH2 domain from the formin family of proteins ( Otomo et al , 2005 ) . Each FH2 chain contacts three actin monomers to create a filament nucleus . The conformation of the FH2 domain in the crystal prevents addition of a Holmes - like barbed - end actin through steric clashes . However , domain swapping by FH2 suggests how this steric hindrance may be overcome to allow pro - cessive elongation . Indeed , the crystals contain a pseudo - Holmes - like filament that is decorated by an FH2 polymer formed through domain swapping . Finally , the structure of the arp2 / 3 complex shows that the relative positions of arp2 and arp3 would allow them to be moved into a Holmes - like orientation without disrupting the integrity of the remain - ing five subunits ( Figs 1H , 3A , B ; Robinson et al , 2001 ) . Closer inspec - tion reveals that the D - loop of arp2 would clash with P21 if an ADP - actin - like conformation were adopted by arp2 ( Fig 1C ) . This clash does not occur if arp2 adopts an ATP - actin - like conformation . The structure of the ATP - bound closed form of arp3 ( within arp2 / 3 ) was recently determined , and it is reasonable to assume that arp2 will also adopt an ATP - bound closed form during activation ( Nolen et al , 2004 ) . Hence , the arp2 / 3 structure provides a stern test for the Holmes - like models . Given that the biological activity of the filament - binding proteins can be superficially accounted for by a filament model that is com - posed of the actin monomer structure , we expect that only subtle changes in the actin protomer structure will occur on polymerization . Holmes - like models : open versus closed protomers The Holmes closed model and the Holmes - like open model conflict in one regard : namely , the width of the nucleotide - binding cleft ( Belmont et al , 1999 ; Holmes et al , 1990 ) . The high - resolution structures under consideration here provide data relevant to this controversy . First , thymosin - β 4 interacts with an actin monomer by review ©2005 EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY ORGANIZATION EMBO reports VOL 6 | NO 3 | 2005 The state of the filament A . H . Aguda et al 223 inserting its C - terminal helix between actin subdomains 2 and 4 . This binding surface would be abolished in the open form of actin . Hence , for related WH2 proteins to cap the filament through this interaction , the terminal pointed - end actin protomer is required to be in a closed conformation . Second , gelsolin caps the barbed end of a filament and secures the gelsolin - bound actins in a closed con - formation by inserting a helix between actin subdomains 1 and 3 , thereby preventing actin from adopting an open form . The F - actin - binding domain ( G2 ) also requires a closed conformation in the terminal actin to allow it access to its binding site on the longitudi - nally adjacent actin ( Burtnick et al , 2004 ) . Thus , both ends of capped filaments require actin protomers that adopt a closed conformation . Furthermore , this argument may be extended to the centre of the fila - ment . In order for gelsolin to bind to the side of a filament and initi - ate severing , G2 must bind to two actin protomers , one of which must be in the closed conformation to provide the correct binding surface for G2 . Therefore , these structures support Holmes - like models that include at least a proportion of closed actin protomers . A B C D Fig 2 | The actin – actin interaction footprint .

H . Aguda et al 225 The arp2 / 3 branched filament The recent structures of the WH2 - motif : actin complexes have pro - vided new insights into the activating proteins for the arp2 / 3 - mediated branch . The arp2 / 3 activators—the WASP family of proteins—contain a minimal activating motif , VCA , that interacts both with actin ( V , a WH2 motif ) and arp2 / 3 ( CA ; Panchal et al , 2003 ) . The structures of ciboulot and thymosin - β 4 define the por - tion of VCA that contacts an actin monomer ( Hertzog et al , 2004 ; Irobi et al , 2004 ) . In the double - WH2 - motif - containing protein N - WASP , the proximity of the two V motifs limits them to assembly with two longitudinally related actin protomers during nucleation . The structures of ciboulot and thymosin - β 4 also led both sets of authors to predict that the amphipathic helix in the C region of the WASP family of proteins will interact with arp2 in a manner similar to that between the amino - terminal helix of the WH2 motifs and actin . The implication , again due to proximity considerations , is that the VCA motif will dock the V - bound actin onto arp2 . This idea is corroborated by the activity of a hybrid arp2 / 3 in which arp2 was fused to a V motif ; the hybrid protein supported branch formation in the presence of CA ( Goley et al , 2004 ) . The arp2 / 3 binding sites for CA are widespread and are found on arp2 , arp3 , P40 and P21 ( Zalevsky et al , 2001 ) . Recently , recombi - nant P40 was shown to contain a high - affinity binding site for VCA that is roughly equivalent to that of the entire arp2 / 3 complex . This contact includes P40 interacting with the A region ( Pan et al , 2004 ) , which was previously shown to bind to arp3 and P21 ( Machesky & Insall , 1998 ; Weaver et al , 2002 ) . Given the proposed docking of the V - bound actin onto arp2 and the high - affinity interaction of CA with P40 , it is difficult to reconcile the distances between arp2 / P40 and arp3 / P21 with the chain length of CA ( the length of the amphipathic helix + 24 residues in the case of WASP - family verprolin homologous protein 1 ( WAVE1 ) ) . Conformational change in arp2 / 3 provides at least a partial explanation ( Goley et al , 2004 ) . However , a dynamic role for CA may also be considered , in which CA may destabilize the inactive conformation through binding to one site on arp2 / 3 ( for example , P40 ) and initiate a conformational change . The active con - formation of arp2 / 3 may then offer a competing CA - binding site ( perhaps arp3 / P21 ) that would stabilize active arp2 / 3 once occupied . Two structural rearrangements of arp2 / 3 have been suggested that will bring arp2 and arp3 into a Holmes - like alignment in order to provide the nucleus for the daughter filament . The rotation model predicts that the two halves of arp2 / 3 ( arp3 / P21 versus arp2 / P16 / P40 ; Robinson et al , 2001 ) will rotate relative to each other on the backbone of P20 / P34 ( Fig 3A , B ) . Alternatively , the arp2 - migration model suggests that interaction between P40 and arp2 is released , which would allow arp2 to be delivered to arp3 by the N - terminal extension of P16 ( Fig 3A , C ; Irobi et a l , 2004 ) . Either mechanism allows for the construction of models of the arp2 / 3 branch solely through structural superposition of known structures and the Holmes model ( Fig 3D ) . The flat face of the arp2 / 3 complex makes a natural angle of about 70° with the daughter branch , which suggests the position of the mother filament . In conclusion , recent structures of F - actin - binding proteins have allowed us to reassess filament models . These structures are consistent with a Holmes - like filament that comprises , at least in part , closed - cleft protomers . The structures of arp2 / 3 and the WH2 motif in complex with actin have led to possibilities for the construction of the arp2 / 3 branched filament . However , these predictions are only models and more structural data are required to determine their worth .
