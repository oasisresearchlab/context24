O RIGINAL A RTICLE The Calcium - Binding Protein EFhd2 Modulates Synapse Formation In Vitro and Is Linked to Human Dementia Eva Borger , PhD , Abigail Herrmann , PhD , David A . Mann , PhD , Tara Spires - Jones , DPhil , and Frank Gunn - Moore , PhD Abstract EFhd2 is a calcium - binding adaptor protein that has been found to be associated with pathologically aggregated tau in the brain in Alzheimer disease and in a mouse model of frontotemporal dementia . EFhd2 has cell type Y speciﬁc functions , including the modulation of intracellular calcium responses , actin dynamics , and microtubule transport . Here we report that EFhd2 protein and mRNA levels are reduced in human frontal cortex tissue affected by different types of dementia with and without tau pathology . We show that EFhd2 is mainly a neuronal protein in the brain and is abundant in the forebrain . Using short hairpin RNA Y mediated knockdown of EFhd2 expression in cultured cortical neurons , we demonstrate that loss of EFhd2 affects the number of synapses devel - oped in vitro whereas it does not alter neurite outgrowth per se . Our data suggest that EFhd2 is involved in the control of synapse devel - opment and maintenance through means other than affecting neurite development . The changes in expression levels observed in human dementias might , therefore , play a signiﬁcant role in disease onset and progression of dementia , which is characterized by the loss of synapses .

Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease of the aging brain . It has become widely accepted that the clinical mani - festations of dementia are strongly correlated with the extent of synapse loss in affected brain regions ( 1 Y 3 ) ; this pathologic hallmark is also observed in other neurodegenerative diseases ( 4 ) . Alzheimer disease ( AD ) and several other neurodegen - erative conditions , including forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ) such as frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 ( FTDP - 17 ) and FTLD - tau with Pick bodies ( Pick disease ) , are classiﬁed as tauopathies . In addition to the loss of synapses , they are char - acterized by the presence of various types of intraneuronal ag - gregates of the microtubule - binding protein tau in brain regions that are involved in clinical manifestations , including de - mentia , aphasia , and behavioral changes ( 5 ) . Fittingly , recent ﬁndings indicate that pathologic forms of tau contribute di - rectly to synaptic degeneration even before their aggregation ; mislocalization and hyperphosphorylation of tau have both been implicated in synaptic pathology in models of AD , in conjunction with amyloid - A peptides ( 6 , 7 ) , as well as in models of FTDs ( 8 , 9 ) . Other forms of FTLD such as FTLD - TDP Type B do not involve tau aggregation but are mostly characterized by intraneuronal inclusions containing the trans - active response - DNA binding protein - 43 ( TDP - 43 ) ; these dis - orders are clinically often associated more with semantic dementia , behavioral - variant FTD , and motor neuron disease ( 5 , 10 ) . Despite the existing detailed clinical descriptions of these different forms of dementia and established links to underlying genetic muta - tions , there is still little known about the molecular basis for their overlapping clinical manifestations and their propensity to cause neuronal and synaptic pathology in overlapping regions of the brain in the frontal and temporal lobes . Studies in a mouse model of FTD and in the brains of humans with dementia have suggested an association of the novel calcium - binding adapter protein Swiprosin - 1 / EF - hand domain containing protein 2 ( EFhd2 ) with pathologically ag - gregated tau ( 11 , 12 ) and have revealed changes in phos - phorylation of EFhd2 at Ser74 in AD frontal cortex ( 13 ) . In addition , changes in EFhd2 protein levels were noted in the prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia ( 14 ) , the vic - tims of suicide ( 15 ) , and spinal cord lipid raft preparations from a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis / motor neuron disease ( 16 ) . Interestingly , its link to pathologic tau and phos - phorylation changes in frontal cortex tissues in dementia ( 12 , 13 ) and the protein expression changes in the frontal cortex reported by Martins - de - Souza et al ( 14 ) and Kekesi et al ( 15 ) hint at a possible functional role for EFhd2 cognitive processes within the frontal cortex in general . Mechanisms for the regulation of EFhd2 expression and its cellular functions in the CNS have not yet been delineated . In immune cells , EFhd2 protein and mRNA expression were J Neuropathol Exp Neurol (cid:1) Volume 73 , Number 12 , December 2014 1166 J Neuropathol Exp Neurol Copyright (cid:1) 2014 by the American Association of Neuropathologists , Inc .

As a calcium sensor , EFhd2 has been identiﬁed as a modulator of B - cell receptor Y induced Ca 2 + signaling ( 19 , 20 ) . Other studies have pointed out an involvement of EFhd2 in actin bundling and polymerization ( 21 Y 23 ) . These data support the idea that EFhd2 is involved in the spatiotemporal control of signaling events within the cell by integrating Ca 2 + - mediated signals and modulating the cytoskeleton . In agreement with this , it has recently been established that EFhd2 can be found in neurites as well as synapses and affect microtubule transport in neurons ( 24 ) . Here , we report that EFhd2 expression levels are altered in the human frontal cortex affected by different types of de - mentia with and without tau pathology . Furthermore , we pres - ent evidence that EFhd2 is directly or indirectly involved in the formation of synapses in cortical neurons in vitro .

Synaptoneurosome Preparation Crude synaptoneurosomes were prepared according to Tai et al ( 25 ) . Two hundred milligrams of fresh - frozen human brain tissue was homogenized in a glass dounce homoge - nizer with 1 mL ice - cold buffer A ( 25 mmol / L HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 120 mmol / L NaCl , 5 mmol / L KCl , 1 mmol / L MgCl 2 , and 2 mmol / L CaCl 2 ) , supplemented with 2 mmol / L dithiothreitol , protease inhibitors , and phosphatase inhibitors . The homoge - nate was passed through 2 layers of 80 - K m nylon ﬁlters ( Millipore , Watford , UK ) , and a 200 - K L aliquot of the ﬁltered homogenate was saved . The saved aliquot was mixed with 200 K L water and 70 K L 10 % SDS , passed through a 27 - gauge needle , and boiled for 5 minutes to prepare the total extract .

Data Analysis Statistical analysis was done in Prism statistical soft - ware ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA ) . Normality of data sets was conﬁrmed using D’Agostino - Pearson normality test , and one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Dunnett post hoc test or 2 - tailed t test was applied depending on the compari - sons made and indicated in ﬁgure legends . RESULTS EFhd2 Protein and mRNA Levels Are Reduced in the Frontal Cortex in Dementia EFhd2 had previously been linked to tau pathology in dementia in a mouse model for FTLD as well as in AD ( 11 , 12 ) . Because AD and FTLD are dementias with different etiologies , these previous ﬁndings warranted further investigation into the role played by EFhd2 in these diseases . Therefore , we compared the protein expression of EFhd2 in human brain tis - sues from individuals with different types of dementia with tau pathology , namely , AD and FTLD - tau and Pick disease , with that in nondemented controls . Protein levels of EFhd2 were analyzed by Western blotting in both frontal cortex as well as hippocampus because both brain regions are affected by their respective neurodegenerative diseases . The analysis revealed a reduction in EFhd2 protein levels in the frontal cortex from AD and both types of FTLD - tau compared with controls ( Fig . 1A , C ) ; these changes were conﬁrmed by quantitative real - time PCR ( Fig . 1E ) , suggesting a speciﬁc reduction of EFhd2 expression in these tissues . Notably , however , no changes in EFhd2 pro - tein levels were observed in hippocampi ( Fig . 2 ) . Because of its link to hyperphosphorylated tau ( 12 ) , we next tested if changes in EFhd2 expression levels correlated with the amount of tau pathology in these brain tissues . The abundance of hyperphosphorylated tau was detected by anti - body clones CP - 13 ( phosphorylated Ser - 202 ) , RZ3 ( phos - phorylated Thr - 231 ) , and PHF - 1 ( phosphorylated Ser - 394 / 404 ) in the previously studied samples . As expected , extensive tau hyperphosphorylation could be detected at all phosphorylation sites in the frontal cortex as well as hippocampal tissues from samples from AD and both forms of FTLD - tau ( Figs . 1B , 2B ) . However , the amount of tau phosphorylation detected by Western blotting did not correlate with the abundance of EFhd2 protein in individual samples ( Figs . 1D , 2D ) . We therefore asked if changes in EFhd2 protein ex - pression are limited to dementias with tau pathology . To answer this question , EFhd2 protein abundance was compared be - tween nondemented controls and cases with tau - negative FTLD ( FTLD - TDP Type B ) . As in the previously studied tau - positive cases , signiﬁcantly lower levels of EFhd2 protein were detected in the frontal cortex tissues in FTLD - TDB Type B cases when compared with nondemented controls ( Fig . 3A , B ) . Again , no signiﬁcant changes in EFhd2 levels could be detected in hip - pocampal tissues from the same cases ( Fig . 3A , C ) . The ab - sence of tau pathology was conﬁrmed by Western blotting for tau phosphorylated at Ser - 394 / 404 ( PHF - 1 epitope ) , which had clearly been detected in AD and FTLD - tau ( Fig . 3A , bottom ) . Together , these results demonstrate that EFhd2 expres - sion levels are altered in the frontal cortex in patients with different types of dementia involving this brain region . Thus , this ﬁnding ﬁts with the idea of a frontal cortex Y related role of EFhd2 in cognitive processes ( 12 Y 15 ) . Whereas tau pathology is a common feature of some of the dementia cases studied here , dysfunction and aggregation of tau itself caused by its hyperphosphorylation per se were not linked to these changes . EFhd2 Is Expressed in Neurons in Brain Tissues EFhd2 protein expression in neurons of the brain has previously been described ( 11 , 24 , 26 ) , but its expression and function have also been linked to cells of the immune system ( 26 , 27 ) , muscle ( 28 ) , and epithelial cells ( 22 , 23 ) . Therefore , we wanted to verify that EFhd2 expression was exclusively neuronal . As expected , immunohistochemistry revealed EFhd2 - labeled cells with neuronal morphology in human brain samples ( Fig . 4 - I ) ; its neuronal location could be conﬁrmed by double immunoﬂuorescence for EFhd2 and the neuronal marker NeuN Borger et al J Neuropathol Exp Neurol (cid:1) Volume 73 , Number 12 , December 2014 (cid:1) 2014 American Association of Neuropathologists , Inc . 1170 Copyright © 2014 by the American Association of Neuropathologists , Inc .

In agreement with recent mRNA expression data ( 24 ) , abundant EFhd2 labeling was present in the forebrain ( hippocampus , cortex , and subcortical structures ; Fig . 4 - IIA Y C ) and 2 different antibodies against EFhd2 exclusively labeled cells that were colabeled with NeuN in the frontal cortex ( Fig . 4 - IID Y F , J , K ) . At the very least , therefore , the vast majority of EFhd2 in the adult mouse brain , and probably the human brain , is present in neurons . Compartment - Speciﬁc Changes in EFhd2 Protein Abundance Having established its neuronal localization , we tested whether changes in EFhd2 protein abundance are associated with speciﬁc compartments in human brain tissue . To this end , ﬁltered synaptoneurosomes were prepared from human brain frontal cortex tissues from dementia and nondemented control patients . Success of the fractionation procedure was veriﬁed by Western blotting for PSD - 95 as a marker for the postsynaptic density and NeuN as a marker for neuronal cell nuclei / cell bodies . We conﬁrmed that there was an absence , or at least a signiﬁcant reduction , of NeuN in the synaptoneurosome and nonsynaptic supernatant fractions and the accumulation of PSD - 95 in the synaptoneurosome fraction compared with the non - synaptic supernatant ( Figure , Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http : / / links . lww . com / NEN / A673 ) . Samples with a signiﬁcant amount of NeuN in the synaptoneurosome fraction ( Figure , Supplemental Digital Content 1 , http : / / links . lww . com / NEN / A673 ) were excluded from the analysis because this indicated in - sufﬁcient fractionation of the tissue . We then compared EFhd2 protein levels by Western blot analysis in each of the fractions ( total tissue homogenates , pelleted synaptoneuro - somes , and nonsynaptic cytoplasmic supernatant ) . Note that we did not assess an enrichment of EFhd2 in the synapto - neurosome fraction because we expected EFhd2 to only par - tially associate with this compartment based on earlier results obtained by Purohit et al ( 24 ) . Comparison of EFhd2 protein levels between groups within each of the fractions again re - vealed signiﬁcantly less EFhd2 in tissue homogenates from FLTD - tau , Pick disease , and FTD - TDP Type B cases as com - pared with controls ( nonsigniﬁcant reduction in AD samples ; Fig . 5A , B , left ) , a ﬁnding which is in line with our earlier results ( Fig . 1 ) . Whereas there was a tendency toward lower levels of EFhd2 in dementia in synaptoneurosomes ( Fig . 5B , middle ) as well as nonsynaptic cytoplasmic supernatants in cases of Pick disease and AD ( Fig . 5A , bottom ; 5B , right ) , changes in these fractions were not signiﬁcant . There were no changes in the levels PSD - 95 in tissue homogenates be - tween groups ( Figure , Supplemental Digital Content 2A , B , left , http : / / links . lww . com / NEN / A674 ) , which is consistent with previous reports of variable effects of dementia on the post - synaptic density ( 2 ) ; also , there were no signiﬁcant changes of NeuN ( Figure , Supplemental Digital Content 2A , B , right , http : / / links . lww . com / NEN / A674 ) . These ﬁndings do not indi - cate the absence of synapse and neuronal loss in the dementia tissues studied here . Extensive atrophy is generally observed at the later stages of dementia ( 29 ) , which translates into a net loss of neurons and synapses but is no longer reﬂected by a relative loss of neuronal and synaptic proteins compared with whole tissue markers . Importantly , adjustment of EFhd2 densitometry results to levels of NeuN in each sample , as a measure of po - tential neuronal cell loss in dementia ( 30 , 31 ) , did not alter the overall outcome ( Figure , Supplemental Digital Content 2C , http : / / links . lww . com / NEN / A674 ) . These results indicate that there are global changes in EFhd2 protein abundance that are mainly associated with cell bodies and neurites . We also observe EFhd2 protein in the synaptic compartment , indicating that it could be playing a role in synaptic processes in the human brain . EFhd2 Is Present in Neuronal Growth Cones and Nascent Presynaptic Structures in Developing Neurons In Vitro and Affects Synapse Formation The role of EFhd2 in neuronal function has not been investigated in detail . A recent report revealed that a loss of EFhd2 does not have a direct impact on synaptic function , but that it does affect transport along microtubules in neuronal cultures ( 24 ) . Studies in other cell types have found EFhd2 at the leading edge of cells where it inﬂuences lamellipodia formation ( 22 , 23 ) . Therefore , we investigated the potential association of EFhd2 with growth cones , which represent the leading edge of neurons , and synapses in developing neuronal cultures . As predicted , coimmunocytochemistry for EFhd2 with tau , tubulin , or ( ﬁlamentous ) actin in cortical neuronal cultures clearly showed an accumulation of EFhd2 at the tip of neuro - nal growth cones ( Fig . 6A ) . A recent study demonstrated that EFhd2 can also be associated with the synaptic compartment in the rodent brain and in mature neuronal cultures ( 24 ) . In addition to this , coimmunoﬂuorescence staining with the pre - synaptic marker synapsin 1a / b in neuronal cultures revealed that EFhd2 can be present at nascent synaptic structures as early as 8 DIV V at a time before the recruitment of postsynaptic ele - ments in vitro ( Fig . 6B , arrows ) . The recruitment of EFhd2 to neuronal growth cones raised the possibility that EFhd2 could have a function in neurite development . To test this hypothesis , overexpression of EGFP - EFhd2 or EGFP alone or knockdown of EFhd2 was induced in primary cortical neurons by lentiviral infection at 1 DIV . Successful expression of EGFP - EFhd2 or EGFP and FIGURE 2 . EFhd2 protein levels are not altered in the hippocampi of human tauopathy patients .

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited . EFhd2 knockdown were conﬁrmed in 3 DIV cultures by ﬂuo - rescence imaging ( Fig . 7A ) and Western blotting ( Fig . 7C ) , respectively . The effect of this modulation of EFhd2 expres - sion on the outgrowth neurites in cortical neurons was then tested by quantiﬁcation of the length of MAP2 - labeled neurites per cell at 3 DIV . Interestingly , EGFP - EFhd2 overexpres - sion or EFhd2 knockdown did not have any effect on the length of neurites developed until 3 DIV ( Fig . 7B ) or at a later stage at 8 DIV ( Figure , Supplemental Digital Content 3 , http : / / links . lww . com / NEN / A675 ) . Because of its partial association with nascent synapses in addition to neuronal growth cones in vitro ( Fig . 6B ) , a potential effect of the loss of EFhd2 on the formation of synapses in cortical neuronal cultures was tested . Presynaptic ( synapsin 1a / b ) puncta in total per micrometer of A 3 - tubulin Y labeled neurites were counted in mature neuronal cultures at 15 to 16 DIV after lentiviral knockdown of EFhd2 or infection with a control shRNA ( Fig . 7D ) . Indeed , this analysis re - vealed that knockdown of EFhd2 facilitates the development of a larger number of synapses in vitro ( Fig . 7E ) . At the same time , there was no difference in the ratio comparing mature synapses identiﬁed by the colocalization of synapsin and PSD95 with nascent structures labeled by synapsin alone ( Fig . 7F ) . These results suggests that a downregulation of EFhd2 in neurons enhances their capacity to induce the for - mation of new functional synapses but does not affect their ability to convert these to mature synapses by recruiting post - synaptic densities . DISCUSSION EFhd2 is a novel calcium - binding protein ; its biologic roles in the CNS have only recently started to emerge . Here we show that EFhd2 protein and mRNA levels are reduced in the frontal cortex in AD , Pick disease , and FTLD with tau pathology and that protein levels are also reduced in FTLD - TDP Type B ( without tauopathy ) compared with nondemented controls ( Figs . 1 , 3 ) . We conﬁrmed these ﬁndings in separate sets of experiments using different methods for protein ex - traction ; EFhd2 protein levels were also found to be reduced in synaptoneurosome preparations from dementia compared with control patients ( Fig . 5 ) .

Interestingly , no signiﬁcant changes in EFhd2 protein abundance could be observed in the hippocampus of either FTLD or AD cases ( Figs . 2 , 3 ) , although this brain region is markedly affected in AD alongside the neocortex ( 32 , 33 ) . We showed by immunohistochemistry that EFhd2 is strongly expressed in the hippocampus ( Fig . 4 - IIA - C ) , which is in agreement with earlier studies ( 12 , 24 ) . However , it is possi - ble that EFhd2 has functions relevant to cognitive processes in neuronal subtypes that are present in the neocortex but not the hippocampal allocortex , and it is also worth noting that its role in the hippocampus has not been investigated to date . Most studies involving EFhd2 in the CNS have analyzed frontal cortex tissues and have investigated neuropathologic pro - cesses that speciﬁcally affect the frontal cortex , such as FTLD ( 12 ) , schizophrenia ( 14 ) , and psychiatric conditions linked to suicide ( 15 ) . Our present data support the notion that EFhd2 might play a signiﬁcant role in the function of the frontal cortex , and that changes in its expression or posttranslational modiﬁcation could be related to common processes underly - ing ( pre ) frontal cortex pathology . The observations that protein and mRNA expression changes are present in tauopathies as well as tau - negative FTLD - TDP Type B and that there is no correlation between the amount of tau hyperphosphorylation and levels of EFhd2 in tauopathies ( Figs . 1 , 2 ) argue against a causative relation - ship between the two . Studies by Vega et al ( 12 ) and Ferrer - Acosta et al ( 11 ) identiﬁed EFhd2 as a protein coaggregating with pathologic tau in AD ; a mouse model for FTLD also suggested an association with tau by coimmunoprecipitation from nondemented control brain tissue ( 12 ) . Its interaction with nonpathologic tau species under physiologic conditions has , however , not been studied . Our data of both EFhd2 and tau proteins at the tip of neuronal growth cones in cultured neurons ( Fig . 6A , top ) support the idea of a functional inter - action between them . We saw a similar relationship between EFhd2 and tubulin as well as actin ( Fig . 6A , middle , bottom ) . Indeed , Purohit et al ( 24 ) demonstrated a direct effect of EFhd2 on microtubule transport in the absence of tau , and previous studies in non - neuronal cells established EFhd2 as an actin - binding protein involved in the regulation of actin bundling ( 22 , 23 , 34 ) . Together , these ﬁndings imply that a functional or physical interaction between EFhd2 and tau might also be caused by their common interaction with tu - bulin and actin and put the role of EFhd2 in the regulation of cytoskeletal function into the center of interest . EFhd2 is partially located in synapses , but it is most strongly associated with neuronal cell bodies and neurites ( 24 ) . EFhd2 protein abundance are global and affect not only cell bodies and neurites in brain tissues affected by dementia but also synaptic compartment ( Fig . 5 ) . The observed reduc - tion of EFhd2 mRNA levels supports this view ( Fig . 1E ) . Because changes tended toward a reduction of EFhd2 in de - mentia in all fractions studied ( Fig . 5B ) , our results also imply that there is no major redistribution of EFhd2 to or from the synaptoneurosomal compartment associated with dementia . It has to be acknowledged , however , that these ﬁndings are based on crude synaptoneurosome preparations by ﬁltration from frozen tissues ( as applied by Tai et al [ 25 ] ) and merely indicate overall changes . Purohit et al ( 24 ) showed that EFhd2 is asso - ciated with the cytosolic as well as the plasma membrane frac - tion in synaptosomes isolated by differential centrifugation . In light of this , future more extensive and precise analyses of EFhd2 distribution and its potential changes in localization in neuropathologic conditions by immunoelectron microscopy and the isolation of synaptosomes and their subfractionation by density gradient centrifugation from fresh tissues would ad - dress these issues . An initial study analyzing the effect of EFhd2 on syn - aptic function found no impact on the turnover of synaptic vesicles in cultured neurons ( 24 ) . We show here that knock - down of EFhd2 does , however , boost the formation of new synaptic connections in cortical neuronal cultures ( Fig . 7E , F ) , whereas it does not affect the growth of neurites ( Fig . 7 ) . In - terestingly , EFhd2 has been shown to affect vesicular trans - port along microtubules ( 24 ) ; thus , it is conceivable that this function is underlying its effect on synapse development , which strongly depends on cytoskeletal rearrangements ( in - cluding tau [ 35 ] ) and is modulated by signaling cascades that EFhd2 has been linked to in other cell types , such as PI3K signaling ( 36 , 37 ) . Importantly , the formation of new synaptic connections is not restricted to embryonic development but is also important in the adult brain , and failure to maintain cur - rent and develop new synapses is strongly linked to dementia ( 1 ) . Possible functions of EFhd2 could be in synapse forma - tion ( e . g . pruning ) during development and / or synapse main - tenance in the adult brain . In this context , it is interesting to note that Purohit et al ( 24 ) found higher levels of EFhd2 ex - pression in the adult mouse brain compared with embryonic brain tissues , which our own preliminary RT - PCR data could conﬁrm ( not shown ) . This suggests that the function of EFhd2 might primarily be in the postnatal or adult brain . Synaptic plasticity is also increasingly being studied in the frontal cortex with regard to dementia and other psychiatric disor - ders , for example , schizophrenia and mood disorders ( 38 ) .

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited . Our data together with the earlier studies raise the possibility that EFhd2 expression levels impact on these processes in the brain , speciﬁcally in the frontal cortex , and that its own regula - tion of expression or posttranslational modiﬁcation ( 13 , 21 , 39 ) could therefore be important . A recent study suggests that such posttranslational modiﬁcation could indeed be relevant for neurodegenerative diseases , that is , phosphorylation of EFhd2 by Cdk5 was found to occur in AD and to affect its calcium - binding activity ( 13 ) . Cdk5 itself has previously been linked to tauopathy ( 40 ) , speciﬁcally in AD ( 41 Y 43 ) , and to other neu - rodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease ( 44 , 45 ) . The positive impact of EFhd2 knockdown on microtubule trans - port ( 24 ) and synapse numbers ( Fig . 7E , F ) implies that , when present , EFhd2 might enable the integration of signaling cues that decide the fate of nascent synapses ; this spatiotemporal regulation is likely to be of pivotal importance for correct neuronal network function and hence cognitive processes . A hypothesis based on current data on the role of EFhd2 in neu - rons in the brain and how it might inﬂuence neuropathologic processes ( or be inﬂuenced by them ) is depicted in Figure 8 . The mechanisms underlying the reduction of EFhd2 expression in the brain have not been elucidated so far . It has FIGURE 8 . Hypothesis on the function of EFhd2 in the brain . EFhd2 inhibits kinesin - mediated anterograde microtubule transport in neurons . This could also involve physical or functional interaction with the microtubule binding protein tau . It also negatively regulates the formation of synapses either directly through its effect on actin remodeling and a potential function in growth cones other than neurite outgrowth or indirectly through its negative impact on microtubule transport . EFhd2 is a Ca 2 + - binding protein , and its function is regulated by intracellular Ca 2 + . Pathologically elevated Ca 2 + might therefore impact on EFhd2 function . Ca 2 + is furthermore involved in signaling mechanisms activating the Cdk5 protein kinase , which inhibits EFhd2 by phosphorylation of residues relevant for its Ca 2 + - binding activity . Pathologically elevated Ca 2 + levels and aberrant activation of Cdk5 have previously been described in neurodegener - ative diseases . Changes in EFhd2 expression as well as synapse loss are associated with dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases affecting the frontal cortex . EFhd2 might be involved in processes such as synaptic pruning or morphologic plasticity in this brain region , and its loss might have a profound impact on the balance of synapse maintenance and exacerbate or be a sign of synaptic pathology .

Therefore , it is plausible that similar mechanisms would exist in neuronal cells . Interestingly , neurotrophic signaling , which activates signaling cascades involving protein kinase C and nuclear factor - J B , is known to be disturbed in dementia ( 46 Y 48 ) , and this might contribute to the observed changes in EFhd2 expression . Further studies delineating the pathways involved in the regulation of EFhd2 expression in the brain are needed and might elucidate new pathways that orchestrate the maintenance of synapses in the frontal cortex . Consequently , these studies will help to under - stand the context of EFhd2 activity in neurons and determine whether its dysregulation could be an indicator of synaptic pa - thology in the human frontal cortex .
