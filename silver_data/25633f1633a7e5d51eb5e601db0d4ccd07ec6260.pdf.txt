Such translocation gener - ates various types of fusions of bcr and abl genes . These fusions differ in terms of having certain types of BCR domains and molecular weight of corresponding chimeric proteins . BCR - ABL p230 is associated with chronic neutrophilic leukemia , BCR - ABL p210 with chronic myelogenous leukemia , and BCR - ABL p190 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . The pleckstrin homology domain of BCR is present in p210 and absent in p190 type of fusion protein . Previously , mass - spectrometry analysis identified 23 potential candidates for interaction with the PH domain , including cortactin that is responsible for actin branching . In this work , it is shown that BCR protein colocalizes with actin and cortactin at the periphery of K562 cells . It also formed clusters of colocalization with clathrin and cortactin and was located at points of actin branching , which was shown by STED super - resolution microscopy and regular confocal microscopy of live HEK 293T cells . Live confocal microscopy also identified a relatively large structure in cytoplasm , where dynamic comovement of BCR , clathrin , and actin was observed . This strongly resembles the Golgi complex since the trans - Golgi network is a typical location for sorting and assembly of clathrin - coated vesicles . Our findings indicate that BCR in tan - dem with cortactin may have an important role in dynamic actin - membrane rearrangements that affect clath - rin - mediated endocytosis and Golgi vesicular transport . The disruption of BCR function by abnormal tyro - sine kinase activity of ABL may promote a cancer phenotype . Keywords : BCR - ABL , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , CML , cortactin , actin branching DOI : 10 . 3103 / S0095452721020055 INTRODUCTION There are three types of BCR - ABL fusion proteins : p190 , p210 , and p230 . They differ in molecular weight due to the presence or absence of certain BCR domains after translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 ( Groffen et al . , 1984 ) . Each type correlates with a specific myeloproliferative disorder . P190 is associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , p210 with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , and p230 with chronic neutrophilic leukemia ( CNL ) ( Van Etten , 1993 ; Emilia et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore , it is very important to study BCR domains that are absent in p190 and present in the other two types . Such data may shed light on a key aspect of the molecular patho - genesis of BCR - ABL - positive myeloproliferative dis - orders . Previously , 23 potential partners in the interac - tion of the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of BCR were identified ( Miroshnychenko et al . , 2010 ) . One of these candidates is cortactin , whose main function is to reorganize actin ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Cortactin plays an active role in the reorganization of actin during the separation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( Zhu et al . , 2005 ) . It branches actin and provides strong support to the vesicle ( Cao et al . , 2003 ) . Cortactin malfunction - ing usually results in increased tumor invasiveness and altered adhesion ( Weaver , 2008 ) . Premature separa - tion of blood cell progenitors from bone marrow stroma is a marker of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( Gordon et al . , 1988 ) . Another distinguishing feature is cytokine - independent proliferation ( Van Etten , 2007 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis often regulates recep - tor - mediated signaling ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , the function of cortactin altered by abnormal BCR - ABL tyrosine kinase activity may affect the uncontrolled proliferation of CML cells . It was previously shown that the ABL part of the BCR - ABL protein binds to actin by its actin - binding domain ( Underhill - Day et al . , 2006 ) . However , little is known about the role of BCR in actin reorganization . In this study , we aimed to determine whether BCR protein colocalizes with actin , clathrin , and cortactin and whether it plays a role in actin reorganization . CYTOLOGY AND GENETICS Vol . 55 No . 2 2021 COLOCALIZATION OF BCR PROTEIN WITH CLATHRIN , ACTIN 153 MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid vectors and genetic constructs . Vector pmCherry - clathrin was a gift from I . Skrypkina ( Insti - tute of Molecular Biology and Genetics , National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine , Kyiv , unpublished data ) . Vector ECFP - Bcr was a gift from John Groffen & Nora Heisterkamp ( plasmids Addgene # 36415 ; http : / / n2t . net / addgene : 36415 ; RRID : Addgene _ 36415 ) ( Cho et al . , 2007 ) . EGFP - clathrin Vector was a gift from T . Gryaznova ( IMBG NASU , Kyiv , unpublished data ) . Vector EGFP - PH was created earlier in our lab - oratory ( Miroshnychenko et al . , 2010 ) . The CTTN sequence was amplified using vector pOTB7 - CTTN from CTTN - F ( 5 ' ATGTGGAAAGCTTCAGCAGG ) and CTTN - R ( 5 ' AGCTCCACATAGTTGGCTGG ) and cloned into vector pBluescriptSKII ( + ) at the EcoRV site . In addition , the coding nucleotide sequence of cortactin was subcloned into pm - TagRFP - N1 ( Michael Davidson , University of Florida ) at the BamHI - SalI sites . Plasmids were isolated from a transformed overnight culture of E . coli NEB Turbo cells grown on a selective antibiotic by alkaline lysis ( Birnboim and Doly , 1979 ) . To obtain plasmid DNA with purity suitable for transfection , CaCl 2 precipita - tion was carried out followed by NaCl / PEG6000 pre - cipitation ( Sauer et al . , 2008 ) . Antibodies and stains . We used rabbit primary poly - clonal anti - BCR antibodies ( Abclonal , AA0068 ) , mouse primary monoclonal anti - BCR antibodies ( Santa - Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 104 ) , rabbit primary anti - clathrin - HC antibodies ( Abclonal , A7886 ) , mouse primary anti - cortactin antibodies ( Santa - Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 55579 ) , conjugated Alexa - 594 secondary anti - mouse antibodies ( Thermo Scientific , R37121 ) , secondary conjugated STAR - RED anti - rab - bit antibodies ( Abberior , Germany ) , mouse conjugated Alexa - 555 secondary antibodies ( Abclonal , AS057 ) , anti - rabbit secondary conjugated Alexa - 647 antibodies ( Abclonal , AS060 ) , ATTO647N - phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich , 65906 ) , FITC - phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich , P5282 ) , DAPI ( Sigma - Aldrich , D9542 ) , and SiR - actin ( Spirochrome , SC001 ) . Fixation and staining . Before fixation , the growth medium was carefully aspirated from the cells . The cells were then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma - Aldrich , 158127 ) in PBS for 15 min at room tempera - ture . After fixation , the cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Serva ) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature . The cells were then washed three times with PBS and blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( Sigma - Aldrich , 05470 ) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature . The blocking solution was removed and the corre - sponding primary antibody solution was added to the cells and incubated overnight at + 4 ° C . After incuba - tion , the cells were washed three times with PBS and the corresponding secondary antibody solution was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature . After incubation with secondary antibodies , the cells were washed three times with PBS and placed on slides with Mowiol 4 - 88 hardening medium ( Sigma - Aldrich , 81381 ) containing 2 . 5 % DABCO ( Sigma - Aldrich , D27802 ) as a reagent for preventing photo - bleaching of fluorophores . The cells were ready for microscopy 24 h after being placed on slides . K562 cells were fixed and stained using a modified protocol , which included centrifugation to remove the supernatant . Transfection and staining of living mammalian cells . The HEK293T cell line was used to visualize living cells , and the K562 and HEK293T cell lines were used for fluorescence microscopy of fixed cells . HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM with the addition of 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Biowest , South Korea ) at 37 ° C , 5 % CO 2 , and 100 % relative humidity . K562 cells were grown in RPMI with the addition of 5 % FBS at 37 ° C , 5 % CO 2 , and 100 % relative humidity . Before transfection , the cells were grown until 70 % conflu - ency or 5 × 10 6 cells . For routine transfections , poly - ethyleneimine ( PEI ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , 408727 ) was used as a transfection agent in a 3 : 1 PEI to ug of plas - mid DNA ratio . Shortly , 1 μ g of plasmid DNA per 10 6 cells was diluted in 100 μ L of serum - free mamma - lian cell growth medium , and the corresponding vol - ume of PEI was diluted in another tube . The contents of both the tubes were mixed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature . After incubation , the transfec - tion mixture was carefully added to the cells . To improve the efficiency of transfecting the K562 cells , we used Turbofect ( Fermentas , Lithuania ) as a trans - fection reagent in the same ratios as described for PEI . The transfection protocol for Turbofect was followed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . To stain actin in living cells , SiR - actin was added to the cell culture 1 h before imaging to a final concentra - tion of 1000 nmol . DMEM without phenol red and with 20 mM HEPES was used to visualize living cells to avoid autofluorescence . Fluorescence microscopy . Stimulated Emission Depletion ( STED ) Super - resolution microscopy was carried out using the Leica SP8 STED - 3D micro - scope with a 100× oil lens and a 1 . 4 numerical aper - ture . A white light laser ( WLL ) was used for both exci - tation and depletion . A 488 - nm laser line was used for EGFP excitation , and 564 - and 633 - nm laser lines were used for Alexa594 and STAR - RED . A 594 - nm STED laser was used to deplete EGFP . A 775 - nm STED laser was used to simultaneously deplete Alexa594 and STAR - RED . For the triple STED image of EGFP clathrin , Alexa 594 , and STAR - RED , we used sequential line - by - line scanning mode for five channels : EGFP - confocal , Alexa594 - confocal , STAR - RED - confocal , Alexa594 - STED , and STAR - RED - STED . After obtaining images from these five channels and depleting Alexa - 594 and STAR - RED , we performed additional scans of EGFP - clathrin - confocal and EGFP - clathrin - STED channels so as not to destroy 154 CYTOLOGY AND GENETICS Vol . 55 No . 2 2021 GURIANOV et al . Alexa594 and STAR - RED by the 594 - nm depletion laser at the initial stage . The laser power was adjusted individually to achieve the optimal signal - to - noise ratio and STED efficiency . For conventional confocal fluorescence microscopy and imaging of living cells , we used the Carl Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal micro - scope with a 100× oil lens and a 1 . 4 numerical aper - ture . We used a 405 - nm laser line for ECFP excitation , a 488 - nm laser line for EGFP excitation , and 532 - and 633 - nm laser lines for mCherry and SiR - actin exci - tation , respectively . The sequential line - by - line mode was used for live images . The laser intensity and detec - tion channels were adjusted to avoid cross - excitation and spectral bleed - through . The effective pixel and voxel size was calculated according to the Nyquist cri - teria ( Whittaker , 1915 ; Shannon , 1998 ) . Living cells were visualized at 37 ° C and 5 % CO 2 in specially designed anodized aluminum slides , milled using a CNC machine containing recesses designed for cover glasses measuring 18 × 18 mm . The dimensions of the slides matched the dimensions of the glass slides and contained a rectangular opening with recesses . Cover - ing glasses were placed on both sides of the recess , and the growth medium was placed between them . Cover glasses were sealed by food - grade silicone grease . Image processing and analysis . Image processing and analysis were carried out using the Fiji software ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Colocalization analysis was carried out in the JaCOP plugin ( Bolte and Cordelin - res , 2006 ) using Manders coefficients ( Manders et al . , 1993 ) . Prior to analysis , a Gaussian blur filter 1 pixel in radius was applied to the image . The background sig - nal was measured using a linear profiler and , if neces - sary , subtracted from the images . The images were then deconvoluted in the Deconvolution Lab 2 plugin ( Sage et al . , 2017 ) using the Richardson - Lucy total variation ( RLTV ) algorithm ( Dey et al . , 2006 ) with the theoretical point spread function ( PSF ) calculated by the PSF Generator plugin ( Kirshner et al . , 2013 ) using the Born and Wolf method ( Steen , 2000 ) . The number of iterations for deconvolution ranged from 5 to 20 and were chosen empirically to best preserve the structure and avoid artifacts . The final editing of the image sets was completed using the Fiji EzFig plugin ( Aigouy and Mirouse , 2013 ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The difference in the phenotype of myeloprolifera - tive disorders , which correlates with various forms of the chimeric BCR - ABL protein , makes the PH domain an important target for studying its role in such dif - ferences . A well - known function of PH domains is phosphoinositide binding in membrane - cytoskeletal reorganization ( Lemmon and Ferguson , 2000 ) . How - ever , this is not the only function of PH domains since they are also important for protein - protein interaction ( Lemmon , 2004 ) . The PH domain itself does not have any signaling function similar to kinase domains . On the other hand , it can facilitate binding to specific cell compartments that are not available for a protein that lacks the PH domain ( Lemmon et al . , 2002 ; Yan et al . , 2005 ) . The normal function of BCR is to control cell polarity ( Narayanan et al . , 2013 ) . This process requires complex remodeling of the membrane and cytoskeleton . This can be achieved through binding of the PH domain to cortactin and synchronization with its actin remodeling activity . Using super resolution STED microscopy , we showed that BCR colocalizes with cortactin and clathrin - coated vesicles , suggesting that BCR may play a dynamin - like role in vesicle invagination . Colocalization mainly occurs on the periphery of cells ( Fig . 1 ) . Analysis of colocalization between EGFP - clathrin and immunostained cortac - tin in K562 cells ( Fig . 1 ) showed that Manders coeffi - cients were M1 = 0 . 195 and M2 = 0 . 545 for confocal images and M1 = 0 . 356 and M2 = 0 . 542 for STED images . For EGFP - clathrin and immunostained BCR , the Manders coefficients were M1 = 0 . 71 and M2 = 0 . 356 for confocal images and M1 = 0 . 856 and M2 = 0 . 57 for STED images . In living HEK293T cells , we observed dynamic colocalization of BCR and actin and BCR and clathrin . We also identified a cytoplas - mic structure with dynamic comovement of clathrin and BCR ( Fig . 2 ) . However , such colocalization did not occur in the perimembrane space , which is char - acteristic of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , but rather in some internal cell compartment . We assume that this may be a sorting complex in the Golgi apparatus . The Trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) is an important ele - ment of the protein transport system and endoso - mal / lysosomal pathways ( Bard and Malhotra , 2006 ) . Clathrin - coated vesicles are formed in TGN due to the coordinated interaction of clathrin , adapter pro - teins , phosphoinosites , and transport proteins ( Daboussi et al . , 2012 ) . Previous works showed that the PH domain is able to interact with phosphatidine - inositol - 3 - phosphates ( PI3P ) , phosphatidine - inosi - tol - 4 - phosphates ( PI4P ) , phosphatidine - inositol - 5 - phosphates ( PI5P ) ( Miroshnychenko et al . , 2010 ) , and Golgi apparatus protein 1 precursor ( GLG1 ) ( Antonenko et al . , 2020 ) . PI4P is an important regula - tor of Golgi function and vesicular transport . BCR and clathrin colocalized in point - like structures over a short period of time ( Fig . 2 ) , which is not surprising given that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is an extremely dynamic process whose cycle lasts less than a minute . We did not observe clear triple colocalization between clathrin , actin , and BCR in living cells . However , we detected active recruitment of BCR in actin branching ( Fig . 2 ) . Manders coefficients were M1 = 0 . 16 and M2 = 0 . 118 for ECFP - BCR and mCherry - clathrin , M1 = 0 . 211 and M2 = 0 . 004 for ECFP - BCR and SiR - actin , and M1 = 0 . 295 and M2 = 0 . 021 for mCherry - clathrin and SiR - actin , respectively . Super - resolution STED microscopy of fixed K562 cells also showed that BCR colocalizes with actin branching points and that the diameter of such colocalization points is CYTOLOGY AND GENETICS Vol . 55 No . 2 2021 COLOCALIZATION OF BCR PROTEIN WITH CLATHRIN , ACTIN 155 approximately 150 nm ( Fig . 3 ) . For immunostained cortactin and immunostained BCR , the Manders coefficients were M1 = 0 . 866 and M2 = 0 . 181 for con - focal images and M1 = 0 . 76 and M2 = 0 . 384 for STED images . Immunostained BCR colocalized with phalloi - din ATTO647N - labeled actin ( Fig . 3 ) with Manders coefficients M1 = 0 . 767 and M2 = 0 . 545 for confocal images and M1 = 0 . 44 and M2 = 0 . 452 for STED images . Triple colocalization between BCR , actin , and contactin was detected on a confocal image of Fig . 1 .

Cort - actin and BCR colocalized pointwise at the periphery of the cell , and actin branched from the point of their colocalization in different directions . The Manders coefficients for colocalization between BCR and CTTN on the confocal image of fixed immunostained cells K562 ( Fig . 4 ) were M1 = 0 . 407 and M2 = 0 . 837 ; for BCR and phalloidin - FITC , M1 = 0 . 565 and M2 = 0 . 676 ; and for cortactin and phalloidin - FITC , M1 = 0 . 883 and M2 = 0 . 529 . Cortactin is a well - known component that regulates vesicle uptake by providing a branched actin matrix in tandem with the Arp2 / 3 complex and dynamin ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , dynamin also has a PH domain , as does the BCR pro - tein . The pleckstrin homology domain is found in almost 30 % of proteins in the human proteome ( Lem - mon , 2004 ) . We also found colocalization between the Fig . 2 .

We did not detect colocalization between the ECFP protein and mCherry - clathrin , and we did not observe the recruitment of ECFP in actin branching ( Fig . 5 ) . For control samples , the Manders coeffi - cients were M1 = 0 . 004 and M2 = 0 . 079 for colocal - ization between SiR - actin and mCherry - clathrin , M1 = 0 . 171 and M2 = 0 . 056 between SiR - actin and ECFP , and M1 = 0 . 935 and M2 = 0 . 033 between mCherry - clathrin and ECFP .

Reorganization of actin filaments is crucial for maintaining the initial phase of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Gu et al . , 2010 ) , which is an important cellular signaling process . Its disruption can lead to changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis that cause oncogenic transformation ( Holst et al . , 2017 ) . Increased expression of certain PI4P - binding proteins can lead to disruption of secretory pathways and the development of the cancer phenotype through changes in cell motility , cell - matrix interaction , and posttransla - tional modification of important signaling proteins ( Mayinger , 2009 ; Waugh , 2019 ) . These data , together with our observations , may suggest that the BCR pro - tein acts as an adapter through interaction with PI4P and PI5P via the PH domain . In addition , the ABL portion of the BCR - ABL fusion protein may adversely affect Golgi integrity , vesicle transport , and transport proteins due to uncontrolled phosphoryla - tion ( Huang and Wang , 2017 ) . The actin network is important for the transport and positioning of the Golgi complex , with cortactin also being involved in this process ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Cao et al . , 2005 ; Kirkbride et al . , 2012 ) . It is important to show whether deletion of the PH domain impairs the Fig . 4 .
