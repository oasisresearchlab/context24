Cordero - Morales 1 Angelman syndrome ( AS ) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by intel - lectual disability and atypical behaviors . AS results from loss of expression of the E3 ubiquitin - protein ligase UBE3A from the maternal allele in neurons . Individuals with AS display impaired coordination , poor balance , and gait ataxia . PIEZO2 is a mechanosensitive ion channel essential for coordination and balance . Here , we report that PIEZO2 activity is reduced in Ube3a de ﬁ cient male and female mouse sensory neurons , a human Merkel cell carcinoma cell line and female human iPSC - derived sensory neurons with UBE3A knock - down , and de - identi ﬁ ed stem cell - derived neurons from individuals with AS . We ﬁ nd that loss of UBE3A decreases actin ﬁ laments and reduces PIEZO2 expression and function . A linoleic acid ( LA ) - enriched diet increases PIEZO2 activity , mechano - excitability , and improves gait in male AS mice . Finally , LA supple - mentation increases PIEZO2 function in stem cell - derived neurons from indi - viduals with AS . We propose a mechanism whereby loss of UBE3A expression reduces PIEZO2 function and identi ﬁ ed a fatty acid that enhances channel activity and ameliorates AS - associated mechano - sensory de ﬁ cits . Angelman syndrome ( AS ) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by cognitive , motor , and behavioral abnormalities 1 . Individuals with AS display impaired motor coordination ( e . g . , unable to reach objects ) , abnormal gait ( i . e . , instability while walking ) , sensory ataxia , scoliosis , seizures , an abnormally happy disposition , and intellectual disability 2 – 4 . Likewise , AS mouse models have clearly de ﬁ ned pheno - types resembling behavioral dysfunction , such as ataxic gait , seizures , and learning de ﬁ cits , making this model useful for testing therapeutics 5 – 8 . The AS phenotype results from the loss of expression of an E3 ubiquitin - protein ligase ( UBE3A ) from the maternal allele 9 – 11 . UBE3A is regulated by genomic imprinting , a process that causes genes to be monoallelically expressed in neurons 12 . The cellular role of the UBE3A ubiquitin ligase is to transfer a single ubiquitin moiety from the E2 protein to a substrate protein 13 . UBE3A targets proteins for degradation , regulates their traf ﬁ cking , and / or modulates their function 14 – 16 . The abnormal gait associated with this disorder is debilitating , as most children have dif ﬁ culty walking 2 . Importantly , gait ( ataxic or broad - based ) is amongthemost common behaviors ( 88 % ) observed in children with AS 4 . UBE3A is imprinted in most brain neurons 1 .

Bruinsma et al . found that cerebellarfunctionisonlypartly responsibleforthebehavioralde ﬁ cits ( e . g . , ataxic - like gait , problems with balance ) displayed by a mouse model of AS 20 . On the other hand , in the peripheral nervous system , it has been shownthat proprioceptive and mechanosensitive dorsalroot ganglia ( DRG ) neurons express the maternal UBE3A allele , while the paternalalleleissilencedbyanantisensetranscript 21 . Hence , thelossof functionofthematernalallele , insensory neurons , couldcontributeto the phenotypes observed in AS . Proprioception confers the ability to sense movement , tension , balance , and limb position 22 . The mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO2 is expressed in sensory neurons innervating muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs , where it mediates proprioception and balance 23 – 26 . A previous study demonstrated that PIEZO2 de ﬁ ciency in humans profoundly decreases proprioception , leading to sensory ataxia 23 . For example , a premature stop codon in PIEZO2 causes unsteady gait and increased stride - to - stride variability in step length and force , among other de ﬁ cits 23 , 27 . Likewise , mice lacking Piezo2 dis - play abnormal limb position and coordination , unstable gait , and balance de ﬁ cits 24 , 26 , 28 . Moreover , PIEZO2 is highly expressed in human Merkel cells and their afferent sensory neurons , where it mediates gentle touch and vibration 29 – 32 . Individuals carrying loss - of - function variants in PIEZO2 have a selective loss of discriminative touch perception 23 . Similarly , mice de ﬁ cient for Piezo2 in the skin display reduced behavioral responses to gentle touch 29 , 30 , 32 . The notable similarities between proprioception phenotypes in individuals with AS or PIEZO2 loss of function ( LOF ) mutations , as well as their associated mouse models , raise the intriguing hypothesis that mechanotransductioncouldbeimpairedinAS . However , itisunclearif the loss of maternal Ube3a expression in DRG neurons affects PIEZO2 activity . Here , weshowthatPIEZO2functionisreducedinASandthata saf ﬂ ower oil diet , enriched in linoleic acid ( LA ) , increases PIEZO2 activity , mechano - excitability , and ameliorates gait ataxia in a mouse model of AS . Results Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons have decreased mechano - currents and - excitability We used mice carrying a LOF Ube3a mutation on the C57BL / 6 genetic background 5 . Heterozygous mice with a maternal de ﬁ ciency ( Ube3a m – / p + ) display AS - associated phenotypes , including lack of balance and gait ataxia . Conversely , mice with a paternal de ﬁ ciency ( Ube3a m + / p – ) do not show imbalance , unsteady gait , or sensory ataxia phenotypes 5 , 6 , 33 . Since mice lacking Piezo2 experience severe mechanosensory and proprioceptive de ﬁ cits 24 , we hypothesized that DRG neurons from the Ube3a m – / p + mice would display impaired mechanical responses . Parenthetically , ~ 80 % of cultured mouse DRG neurons display mechanically activated currents 34 . These mechanocurrents display various inactivation kinetics ( i . e . , rapidly , intermediate , and slowly inactivating currents ) . The rapidly inacti - vating currents ( τ < 10 ms ) have been previously assigned to mouse PIEZO2 35 , whereas the intermediate ( 10 < τ < 30ms ) and slowly inactivating currents ( τ > 30ms ) have not yet been identi ﬁ ed . We measured mechanocurrents in the whole - cell patch - clamp con ﬁ guration from wild - type ( WT ) , Ube3a m – / p + , and Ube3a m + / p – mouse DRG neurons . All experiments in this work were performed with male mice unless noted . All the mechanocurrents ( including the rapidly inactivating currents assigned to PIEZO2 ) from the Ube3a m – / p + neurons weresigni ﬁ cantlyreducedcomparedtoWTor Ube3a m + / p – DRGneurons ( Fig . 1a - b and Supplementary Fig . 1a - b ) . The displacement threshold required to elicit mechanocurrents in the Ube3a m – / p + neurons was slightly higher than WT or Ube3a m + / p – ( Fig . 1c ) . The percentage of DRG neurons featuring PIEZO2 mechanocurrents ( i . e . , rapidly inactivating currents ) was similar between WT , Ube3a m – / p + , and Ube3a m + / p – cultures ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Moreover , the capacitance distribution of recorded neurons wasskewed towards medium to large diameter cells ( i . e . , mechanoreceptors 36 ) and , importantly , was similar for WT , Ube3a m – / p + , and Ube3a m + / p – neurons ( Supplementary Fig . 1d - e ) . Par - enthetically , DRG neurons from female Ube3a m – / p + mice also displayed reduced mechanocurrents compared to WT or Ube3a m + / p – ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1f - g ) . PIEZO2 mediates most of the mechano - activated excitatory currents in mouse DRG neurons 24 , 31 . As neurons from Ube3a m – / p + mice displaydecreasedmechanocurrentsandanincrease in displacement threshold , we sought to determine the ability of these neurons to elicit mechanically - activated action potentials . Ube3a m – / p + neurons required larger indentation steps to elicit action potentials than WT or Ube3a m + / p – ( ≥ 12 μ m ; Fig . 1d - e ) . Importantly , Ube3a m – / p + neurons have similar neuronal electrical excitability compared to WT neurons ( membrane capacitance , action potential amplitudes , input resistances , and minimal current threshold required to elicit an action potential ; Supplementary Fig . 1d , h - k ) . These results demonstrate that mechanocurrents ( including those from PIEZO2 ) and mechano - excitability are reduced in Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons . UBE3A knockdown alters the cytoskeleton and decreases PIEZO2 function We asked whether knocking down the expressionof UBE3A ina human cell line by silencing RNA ( siRNA ) could recapitulate our ﬁ ndings in DRG neurons . PIEZO2 is expressed in Merkel cells ( tactile epithelial cells ) and their innervating afferents , where it transduces skin indentation 29 , 30 , 32 . Tosupportfunctionalandbiochemicalexperiments , we utilized the human Merkel cell carcinoma cell line ( MCC13 ) , in which PIEZO2 mediates all endogenous mechanosensitive currents 37 . MCC13 cells displayed a decrease in PIEZO2 currents after knocking down the expression of UBE3A or PIEZO2 , when compared with mechanocurrents from the scrambled siRNA treatment ( 47 % and 74 % , respectively ; Fig . 2a ) . We validated the siRNA treatment by performing RT - qPCR ( Supplementary Fig . 2a - b ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of mRNA levels demonstrates that knocking down UBE3A does not affect PIEZO2 transcripts ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . As expected , decreasing the mRNA levels of UBE3A reduced UBE3A protein expression ( Supple - mentary Fig . 2c - d ) . Notably , knocking down the expression of UBE3A decreased 23 % of PIEZO2 membrane levels in MCC13 cells ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . For electrophysiology experiments , we pat - ched cells expressing the transfection marker siGLO green , whereas for western blots , we extracted membrane protein from a mixed cul - ture of transfected and untransfected cells . This could explain the difference in effect size between currents and membrane protein expression reduction ( 47 % vs . 23 % ) . Conversely , UBE3A over - expression by transient transfection of UBE3A in MCC13 cells showed increased PIEZO2 currents and membrane expression ( Fig . 2c - d and Supplementary Fig . 2f ) . Taken together , in both mouse DRG neurons and human cell lines , downregulation of UBE3A expression decreases PIEZO2 currents . Ube3a de ﬁ cient mice display reduced ﬁ lamentous actin ( F - actin ) in cultured hippocampal neurons 38 . Moreover , using proteomic pro - ﬁ ling , we have previously shown in D . melanogaster that Ube3a homozygous mutants have less F - actin , consistent with the identi ﬁ - cation of actin targets regulated by Ube3a 39 . PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 channel function is modulated by cytoskeletal elements 40 – 43 . We pre - viouslydemonstratedthatdisruptingactin ﬁ lamentswithlatrunculinA decreased PIEZO2 currents in N2A cells 42 . Therefore , we tested the hypothesis that loss of UBE3A expression could decrease PIEZO2 cur - rents by impairing F - actin . MCC13 cells treated with latrunculin A dis - playreduced PIEZO2 currentscompared tountreated cells ( Fig . 2e ) . Of note , we measured a decrease in PIEZO2 membrane expression levels in MCC13 cells after latrunculin A treatment , as well as a reduction in F - actin content ( Fig . 2f and Supplementary Fig . 2g - i ) . Importantly , Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 36818 - 0 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 1167 2 we also observed a reduction in actin content after knocking down the expression of UBE3A in MCC13 cells ( Fig . 2g and Supplementary Fig . 2j ) . Our data support that knocking down UBE3A expression reduces actin ﬁ laments , leading to a decrease in PIEZO2 membrane expression and currents . UBE3A could alter actin dynamics by regulating the content of actin - binding protein ( s ) . Co ﬁ lin is an actin - binding protein that pro - motes rapid actin ﬁ lament disassembly 44 . We determined an increase in co ﬁ lin content after knocking down the expression of UBE3A in MCC13 cells ( Fig . 2h and Supplementary Fig . 2k ) . Moreover , over - expression of co ﬁ lin in MCC13 cells , by transient transfection , decreasedPIEZO2currentscomparedtocontrolcells ( Fig . 2i ) . Previous works have shown that co ﬁ lin can be ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases Cbl and AIP4 45 ; however , whether UBE3A ubiquitinates co ﬁ lin is unknown . Using a stringent cell - culture based ubiquitination assay 46 , 47 , we demonstrated that co ﬁ lin ubiquitination is increased by WT UBE3A but not by a ligase dead ( LOF ) version of this E3 enzyme ( Fig . 2j and Supplementary Fig . 2l ) . Our ﬁ ndings support a model whereby loss of UBE3A expression increases co ﬁ lin , which severs actin ﬁ laments and decreases PIEZO2 membrane expression and currents . Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons display reduced F - actin , and promoting actin polymerization increases PIEZO2 currents Based on our ﬁ ndings in MCC13 cells , we reasoned that Ube3a m – / p + mouse DRG neurons could have a reduced F - actin content . Indeed , cultured Ube3a m – / p + neurons ﬁ xed and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin ( selective actin ﬁ lament stain ) displayed a reduced mean ﬂ uorescence intensity compared to WT ( Fig . 3a ) . This result is further supported by the increase in the G / F actin ratio in Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons , as determined by western blots ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Jasplakinolide is a peptide that promotes actin polymerization and stabilizes actin ﬁ laments 48 . Notably , jasplakinolide treatment sig - ni ﬁ cantly increased PIEZO2 currents in Ube3a m – / p + mouseDRG neurons ( Fig . 3c ) . An increase in co ﬁ lin could account for the decrease in actin in the Ube3a m – / p + mouse DRG neurons . We found elevated levels of co ﬁ lin ( a target of UBE3A ) in Ube3a m – / p + mouse DRG neurons when compared to neurons from WT mice ( Fig . 3d and Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Importantly , knocking down the expression of co ﬁ lin in Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons increases PIEZO2 currents similar to WT levels ( Fig . 3e ) . Taken together , our results demonstrate that Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons have an impaired actin cytoskeleton and treatments that stabilize actin ﬁ laments or reduce co ﬁ lin expression increase PIEZO2 function . Linoleic acid increases PIEZO2 currents There are no agonists available for PIEZO2 49 . We have previously shown that PIEZO1 ( a close homolog of PIEZO2 ) displayed slower inactivation and more mechanocurrents in plasma membranes con - taining high levels of linoleic acid ( LA , ω - 6 C18 : 2 ) 50 and Supplemen - tary Fig . 4a .

Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 36818 - 0 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 1167 3 wetested the abilityofLA to enhance PIEZO2 function . Tothis end , we transfected Piezo2 variant 14 ( abundant in the mouse trigeminal ganglion ) 51 into N2A cells lacking Piezo1 ( Piezo1 − / − N2A cells ) 52 to dis - tinguish the effect of LA on PIEZO2 gating unequivocally . PIEZO2 mechanocurrents were measured after supplementing the cell media overnight with100 μ MLA . SupplementationwithLAincreasedPIEZO2 currents twofold ( − 50 . 09± 19 . 84 pA / pF vs . − 106 . 32 ± 58 . 9 pA / pF , mean ± SD ) ( Fig . 4a - b and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Overnight incuba - tion with LA increased ( ~ sevenfold ) the plasma membrane content of this PUFA , as determined by liquid chromatography - mass spectro - metry ( LC - MS ; Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Next , we tested fatty acids of varyingacyl - chainlengthandunsaturations toassessthechemicaland structural bases whereby LA increases PIEZO2 function . We did not observeanincrease in PIEZO2 activity forstearic acid ( SA ; C18 : 0 ) , oleic acid ( OA ; C18 : 1 ) , ω − 6 PUFAs downstream of LA [ gamma linolenic acid ( γ LA ; C18 : 3 ) , dihomo gamma - linolenic acid ( D γ LA ; C20 : 3 ) , arachidonic acid ( AA ; C20 : 4 ) , docosatetraenoic acid ( DTA ; 22 : 4 ) ] , or ω - 3 PUFAs ( α LA ; C18 : 3 and DHA ; C22 : 6 ) ( Fig . 4a - b and Supplementary Fig . 4d - e ) . Additionally , LA slowed PIEZO2 channel inactivation in Piezo1 – / – N2A cells ( Fig . 4a and c ) . These results support that LA ( C18 : 2 ) , but not the other fatty acids tested , enhances PIEZO2 activity . Similar to Piezo1 – / – N2A cells , we measured a signi ﬁ cant increase in endogenous PIEZO2 currents in MCC13 cells after overnight supplementation with LA , in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 4d - e and Supplementary Fig . 4f ) . We also used an alternative supplementation protocol to add lower doses of LA for several days . Supplementing MCC13 cells with 20 μ M LA each day , for ﬁ ve days , signi ﬁ cantly increased PIEZO2 currents ( Fig . 4d - e ) . These concentrations are within the range of circulating fatty acids pre - sent in the blood plasma of healthy adults 53 .

Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 36818 - 0 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 1167 4 demonstrate that the essential dietary fatty acid LA ( C18 : 2 ) increases PIEZO2 activity . LA increases membrane structural disorder Western blot analyses revealed that LA supplementation did not increase PIEZO2 membrane expression in MCC13 cells ( Fig . 5a - b ) . Furthermore , perfusion of free LA ( 150 μ M ) onto Piezo1 – / – N2A cells transfected with PIEZO2 did not change channel function ( Fig . 5c - d ) . Hence , it is possible that LA increases PIEZO2 function by modifying the membrane ’ s mechanical properties . To determine the effect of LA on membranes , we used differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and measured changes in the heat - capacity pro ﬁ les ( Cp ) of synthetic membranes ( 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine , DPPC ) containing various fatty acids . From the DSC thermograms , we obtained melting transition temperature ( Tm ) and cooperativity ( κ ) as a readout of both lipid - lipid interaction and membrane organization ( Fig . 5e ) 54 , 55 . LA displayed the lowest melting temperature ( i . e . , less temperature required to transition from the gel to the liquid phase ) compared to DPPC alone or liposomes containing SA , OA , γ LA , D γ LA , AA , or DTA ( Fig . 5e - f ) . This result indicates that LA elicits the largest increase in membrane structural disorder . We also determined that liposomes containing LA display the largest cooperative unit , indicat - ing that there are more lipids undergoing the phase transition simul - taneously ( Fig . 5g ) . The effect ofLA versusthe otherfatty acidsismade furtherapparentwhenplottingthecurrentdensities ( fromFig . 4b ) asa function of cooperativity ( Pearson ’ s r : 0 . 93 ; Fig . 5h ) . Next , we tested the effect of LA supplementation on the bac - terial mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance ( MscL ) , whose gating relies solely on the mechanical properties of the plasma membrane 56 .

Similar to what has been reported for MscL reconstituted in liposomes containing LA 57 , supplementing N2A cells with this fatty acid increased the function of MscL , when comparedto untreated cells , as determined by the leftward shift in the pressure required to open the channel ( Fig . 5i - j ) . Taken together , these results support the notion that the effect of LA on increasing PIEZO2 function is likely through membrane remodeling ( i . e . , higher membrane ﬂ uidity and coopera - tivity ) rather than changes in protein expression or the interaction of free LA with the channel . Linoleic acid supplementation increases mechanocurrents in Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons We tested whether LA could increase mechano - responses in DRG neurons dissected and cultured from Ube3a m – / p + mice . The culture media was supplemented with LA ( 50 µ M for the ﬁ rst 24 h , followed by 100 µ M for the second 24 h period ) for two days before measuring currents . A two - day supplementation protocol improved neuronal viability and the ability to perform patch - clamp recordings . Like DRG neurons measured after 24 h ( Fig . 1b ) , Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons dis - played reduced mechanocurrents compared with WT or Ube3a m + / p – DRG neurons , after 48 h in culture ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Notably , LA supplementation increased all the mechanocurrents in cultured DRG neurons from WT , Ube3a m – / p + , and Ube3a m + / p – mice ( Fig . 6a - d and Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Ube3a - de ﬁ cient neurons supplemented with LA displayed a decrease in the displacement threshold required to elicit mechanocurrents when compared to control , whereas no effect was measured for WT and Ube3a m + / p – neurons ( Fig . 6e ) . Parenthetically , we found that DRG neurons supplemented with LA have similar membrane capacitance , action potential amplitudes , resting potentials , input resistances , and minimal current threshold required to elicit an action potential , compared to control neurons ( Supplementary Fig . 5c - h ) , suggesting that LA does not affect neu - ronal electrical excitability . Additionally , LA supplementation does not alter the function of the sensory receptors TRPV1 , TRPA1 , and TRPM8 ( Supplementary Fig . 5i - n ) . Together , these results demon - strate that LA increases mechanocurrents , including those from PIEZO2 , while decreasing the mechanical threshold for Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons . A linoleic acid - enriched diet recovers Ube3a m – / p + neuronal mechano - currents and - excitability LA is an essential ω - 6 fatty acid and a structural component of plasma membranes 58 . It is commonly found in saf ﬂ ower , soybean , sun ﬂ ower , corn , and canola oils 59 – 61 . Since LA supplementation in the culture media increases mechanocurrents , we postulated that including LA in the animal ’ s diet may rescue the mechano - de ﬁ cits of Ube3a m – / p + DRG neu - rons . To this end , we used a non - western - style diet enriched in saf ﬂ ower oil as a delivery method to increase LA in DRG neurons . Oil from the seedsofthesaf ﬂ owerplanthasbeenshowntocontainover70 % LA 62 . LA can accumulate when its consumption in the diet is increased due to its limited conversion by the delta - 6 desaturase enzyme 59 . We pair - fed Ube3a m – / p + micefor12 weekswithaLA - enricheddietandfoundthattheir DRG neurons had higher LA membrane content ( ~ twofold ) when com - pared to WT and Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a standard diet ( Fig . 7a ) , as determined by LC - MS .

Remarkably , cultured DRG neurons from Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a LA - enriched diet displayed robust mechanocurrents and a lower displacement threshold when compared to neurons from Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with standard or high - fat diets ( Fig . 7b - d and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . Although the LA - enriched diet enhanced PIEZO2 - and inter - mediate inactivating mechanocurrents , it had no effect on those that were slowly inactivating ( Fig . 7c , right panel ) . However , further supple - menting DRG neurons from Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a LA - enriched diet with additional LA ( during culture ) increased the slowly inactivating currents ( Supplementary Fig . 6c - d ) . Next , we tested DRG neurons of the Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a LA - enriched diet for their ability to elicit mechanically activated action potentials . These neurons required smaller indentation steps ( ≤ 10 μ m , like WT and Ube3a m + / p - mice ) to elicit action potentials compared to neurons from Ube3a m – / p + mice on stan - dard or high - fat diets ( ≥ 12 μ m ; Fig . 7e - f ) . We also tested the effect of a LA - enriched diet on WT animals and found that LA increased PIEZO2 currents in neurons compared to those from animals fed with a standard diet , but did not change the displacement thresholdor thresholdfor mechanicallyactivated action potentials ( Supplementary Fig . 6e - i ) . Of note , WT , Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a standard diet , and Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a LA - enriched diet had similar body weights after pair - feeding ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . Furthermore , Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a LA - enriched diet displayed similar behavioral responses to noxious mechanical ( pinprick and tail clip ) and thermal stimuli ( hot plate and Hargreaves ) , suggesting that a LA - enriched diet does not enhance nociception ( Supplementary Fig . 7b - e ) . We also determined that feeding the LA - enriched diet to Ube3a m – / p + mice did not alter their cytokine pro ﬁ le compared to those fed with the control diet , indicating that the non - western saf ﬂ ower oil - enriched diet does not induce in ﬂ ammation ( Supplementary Fig . 7f ) . These results demonstrate that a LA - enriched diet increases mechan - ocurrents , includingthosefromPIEZO2 , andissuf ﬁ cienttorecoverthe mechanical excitability of Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons . A linoleic acid - enriched diet ameliorates gait ataxia in a mouse model of AS We sought to determine the effect of the LA - enriched diet on the gait of Ube3a m – / p + mice .

We performed a gait analysis for the quantitative assessment of footfalls and locomotion using the CatWalk system ( Noldus XT ) for WT , Ube3a m – / p + , and Ube3a m + / p – mice after feeding them with standard , LA - enriched , or high - fat diets for 12 weeks ( Fig . 8a - c ) . Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a standard diet displayed anincreased stride length for their front and hind paws compared to the WT or Ube3a m + / p – mice fed with the samediet ( Fig . 8d ) . Wealsoobservedadecreaseinthenumberofsteps taken during the assay for the Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with the standard diet ( Fig . 8e ) . Petkova et al . reported a difference of ~ 13 % between the stride length of F1 controls and Ube3a m - / p + littermate mice , which is within the range of the difference we observed of ~ 12 – 15 % in our behavioral work using non - littermate mice 8 . Notably , we found that feeding Ube3a m – / p + mice with a LA - enriched diet restored the stride length and the number of steps to WT levels ( Fig . 8f - g ) . On the other hand , feeding WT and Ube3a m + / p – mice with a LA - enriched diet did not alter their stridelength or the numberof steps ( SupplementaryFig . 8a - d ) . The stride length and number of steps from Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a high - fat diet resemble those of the Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a standard diet , supporting that LA , rather than the high caloric intake , ameliorates gait ataxia in Ube3a m – / p + mice . AS mouse models display impaired rotarod performance 7 , 10 , 65 , 66 . A LA - enriched diet did not improve Ube3a m – / p + mouse rotarod performance ( Supplementary Fig . 8e ) , suggesting that cerebellar defects , not peripheral mechan - osensory de ﬁ ciencies , regulate rotarod performance in AS mice . This idea is in alignment with recent work showing that cerebellothalamic tracts mediate motor coordination but not gait 67 . Taken together , these results suggest that a LA - enriched diet can ameliorate gait ataxia ( stride length and the number of steps ) in a mouse model of AS . Knocking down UBE3A expression decreases PIEZO2 currents in human iPSC - derived sensory neurons To extend our ﬁ ndings to human models , we reprogrammed human - induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) into sensory neurons .

We found that these in vitro - derived sensory neurons displayed mechanocurrents characteristic of PIEZO2 , such as voltage - dependent inactivation and non - selective cation currents ( Supplementary Fig . 9a - c ) . Similar to MCC13 cells , we measured a decrease in PIEZO2 currents after knocking down the expression of UBE3A or PIEZO2 in these in vitro - derived sensory neurons as com - pared with mechanocurrents from the scrambled siRNA treatment ( Fig . 9a - b ) . Overnight incubation of human iPSC - derived sensory neurons with LA increased endogenous PIEZO2 currents while decreasing the displacement threshold required to elicit mechan - ocurrents ( Fig . 9c - e ) . Like Piezo2 transfected in Piezo1 – / – N2A cells , LA supplementation elicited a ﬁ vefold increase in the time constant of inactivation ( Supplementary Fig . 9d ) . Additionally , human iPSC - derived sensory neurons supplemented with LA required smaller indentation steps ( ≤ 6 μ m ) to elicit mechanically activated action potentials than untreated sensory neurons ( Fig . 9f ) . These results demonstratethat UBE3A expressionmodulatesthefunctionofPIEZO2 , while LA increases PIEZO2 activity and enhances mechanical excit - ability in human iPSC - derived sensory neurons . Stem cell - derived neurons from individuals with AS display reduced mechanocurrents Dental pulp stem cells ( DPSC ) can be differentiated into neuronal cell types andare commonlyused tostudy neurogeneticdisorders 69 – 72 . We have previously demonstrated that DPSC - derived neurons from indi - viduals with AS show both molecular and cellular features character - istic of AS 72 – 74 . Here , we found that DPSC - derived neurons from multiple individuals with AS displayed reduced mechanocurrents , including those characteristic of PIEZO2 ( Fig . 9g - h and Supplementary Fig . 9e ) . As expected , LA supplementation increased all mechan - ocurrents of DPSC - derived neurons from individualswith AS ( Fig . 9g - h andSupplementaryFig . 9e ) .

Actin is also well known to regulate membrane protein traf ﬁ cking 75 . Notably , several studies indicate that an intactcytoskeleton is required for normalPIEZO2 function 35 , 43 , 52 , 76 , 77 , including our previous work in which we demonstrated that PIEZO2 mechanosensitivity relies on the synergy between the mechanics of the plasma membrane and F - actin 42 . We propose a mechanism whereby lossof UBE3A expression leads to an increasein co ﬁ lin , which severs actin ﬁ laments , and in turn , decreases PIEZO2 membrane expression and function in the context of AS ( Fig . 10 ) . F - actin disrup - tion might decrease PIEZO2 activity by impairing force transmission from the plasma membrane to the channel . Based on our data , we envision that diminished mechanical excitability , caused by reduced PIEZO2 activity , could impair somatosensory input from the limbs , resulting in the gait ataxia observed in AS . Treatments ( natural and / or pharmaceutical ) that increase PIEZO2 currents could bypass the de ﬁ - cits associated with the intracellular loss of UBE3A expression and F - actin de ﬁ ciency . With the recent discovery that gain - and loss - of - function muta - tions in PIEZO2 have a detrimental effect on human skeletal develop - ment , balance , and proprioception 23 , 78 – 80 , it has become clear that agonists / antagonists or molecules that modulate PIEZO2 function Fig . 8 | A LA - enriched diet ameliorates gait ataxia in the Ube3a m – / p + mouse . a Timelinedepictingtheexperimentaldesignforgaitanalyses .

For instance , a diet enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) decreases PIEZO2 function ( by increasing channel inactivation ) and counteracts the detrimental effect of a PIEZO2 gain - of - function mutation causing distal arthrogryposis in mice 81 . Currently , there are no available ago - nists for PIEZO2 . Molecules that enhance PIEZO2 function could bypassthe mechano - sensoryde ﬁ cits associated with the lossof UBE3A expression . Importantly , we have identi ﬁ ed a fatty acid ( LA ) that increases PIEZO2 mechanocurrents . The ω - 6 fatty acid LA , a structural componentofmembranephospholipids , isanessentialPUFAenriched in saf ﬂ ower , soybean , sun ﬂ ower , corn , and canola oils 59 – 61 . In this work , we used a nonwestern - style diet enriched with 59 % of fat - derived cal - ories from saf ﬂ ower oil as a delivery method to maximize the LA content . Parenthetically , a ketogenic dietary ( > 60 % of its calories from fat ) interventionhasbeen shown to reduce seizures in individualswith AS 82 – 85 . LA can accumulate when its consumption in the diet is increased due to its limited conversion by the delta - 6 desaturase enzyme 59 . For instance , a systematic review of human trials demon - strated that increasing dietary LA consumption signi ﬁ cantly increases tissue levelsof LA , but not AA , in adults 59 . Thesetrials alsosupport that even though humans already consume LA , it can be effectively increased in tissues when further supplemented in the diet . Our data corroborate this notion since mice fed with a non - western style saf ﬂ ower - enriched diet resulted in an increase in LA membrane content in DRGs , with no signi ﬁ cant changes in downstream ω - 6 PUFAs ( e . g . , AA ) . We observed that the slowly adapting mechanocurrents increase when LA is supplemented in the media , but not after feeding the Ube3a m – / p + mice with a LA - enriched diet . Since we determined that LA accumulates in membranes sevenfold when supplemented in culture media versus twofold when fed directly to mice , it is tempting to speculate that the slowly adapting mechanocurrents might require more LA accumulation than is achieved in our 12 - week diet protocol . Indeed , we observed an increase in the slowly adapting mechan - ocurrents of DRG neurons from Ube3a m – / p + mice fed with a LA - enriched diet after supplementing them with LA in the culture media . Although dietary PUFAs share structural similarities , we previously demon - strated that EPA , but not AA , enhances TRPV4 channel activity ; both PUFAs have 20 carbons , but EPA contains ﬁ ve unsaturations instead of four 86 , 87 . Here , we also revealed a degree of speci ﬁ city since PIEZO2 currents were increased by LA ( ω - 6 C18 : 2 ) but not by SA ( C18 : 0 ) , OA ( C18 : 1 ) , PUFAs downstream of LA , α LA ( ω - 3 C18 : 3 ) , or DHA ( C22 : 6 ) . These results highlight that PUFAs add a level of regulation and that subtle changes in their structure ( e . g . , unsaturations ) differentially in ﬂ uence channel function . Mechanosensitive ion channels , like PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 , open by directly sensing the physical state of the plasma membrane 88 . Hence , modifying the plasma membrane by changing rigidity 42 , 49 , local Fig . 10 | Proposed mechanism whereby lack of UBE3A decreases mechan - osensation in AS .

LA increases PIEZO2 function and ameliorates gait de ﬁ cits . Created with BioRender . com .

Previous studies have shown that plasma membranes enri - ched in PUFAs display decreased membrane rigidity and enhanced function of the mechanoreceptor and photo - transduction channel complexes in C . elegans 91 and D . melanogaster 92 in vivo . Our results in synthetic DPPC liposomes agree with previous works in which LA decreased the melting transition temperature of lipid membranes 93 , 94 . Since the DSC results demonstrated that LA increases membrane ﬂ uidity and cooperativity in synthetic lipids , we propose that LA could exert similar effects on cell membranes and , in turn , increase PIEZO2 function by reducing its activation threshold , as determined for MscL in liposomes 57 and in this work in cells . The lack of effect on PIEZO2 mechano - responses when perfusing free LA , together with increased MscL function ( a channel whose gating is solely determined by the mechanical properties of the membrane 56 ) after LA supplementation , supports that the effect of LA on PIEZO2 function is likely through plasma membrane remodeling rather than direct interaction . We envision that membranes enriched in LA might favor the open state of PIEZO2 by facilitating force transmission from the blades ( i . e . , trans - membrane domains ) to the pore . Our results do not rule out speci ﬁ c interactions between LA ( when part of the membrane ) with PIEZO2 . However , due to the size of PIEZO2 ( ∼ 310kDa ) , classical mutagenesis experiments used to pinpoint interaction sites are impractical . Inter - estingly , recent cryo - EM structures of PIEZO1 reconstituted in lipo - somes showed various bound phospholipids in the blade of the channel in the curved conformation ( i . e . , closed - like ) , but not in the ﬂ attened ( i . e . , open - like ) one 95 . Future structural studies of PIEZO2 in the presence or absence of LA could help identify putative interaction sites that could be functionally tested . It has been suggested that the behavioral de ﬁ cits ( e . g . , ataxic - like gait , problems with balance ) displayed by a mousemodelofAS arenot solely of cerebellar origin 20 . The recent discovery that PIEZO2 de ﬁ - ciency in humans results in an unsteady gait and increased stride - to - stride variability and step length 23 , 27 , together with our ﬁ nding that Ube3a m – / p + DRG neurons display decreased mechanocurrents and - excitability , suggests that a decrease in PIEZO2 function could con - tribute tothe gait ataxia experiencedinAS . Inthis work , we focused on determining the mechanism whereby UBE3A regulates mechan - osensationinAS . Eventhoughweprovidedevidencethatlossof UBE3A expression decreases PIEZO2 membrane expression and activity , we do not have direct evidence demonstrating that the reduction of PIEZO2 function is the main cause of the gait phenotype in AS . More experimental insight will be needed to determine the full implications of the reduction of PIEZO2 on gait in the context of AS . Although we found that a LA - enriched diet increases PIEZO2 activity and mechano - excitability , as well as ameliorates gait de ﬁ cits in a mouse model of AS , our work does not rule out that the effect of LA on behavior could occur somewhere else beyond solely increasing PIEZO2 function in DRG neurons . Future experiments could be directed to test the effect of the LA diet on neuronal Piezo2 conditional knockout mice . Never - theless , our work provides proof of concept that manipulating fatty acid content in vivo can modulate the function of a mechanosensitive ion channel . Methods Ethics approval Animals . Mice procedures described below were reviewed and approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center ( UTHSC ) Institutional Animal Careand Use Committee ( UTHSC IACUC number : Protocol # 19 - 0084 ) . All methods were carried out in accor - dance with approved guidelines . Adult ( 2 - to 4 - month - old ) mice were housed with a 12 h light / dark cycle at 21 °C with 40 - 60 % humidity , and with food and water ad libitum . Male and female heterozygous Ube3a m – / p + maternal - and Ube3a m + / p – paternal - transmission knockout mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory , strain C57BL / 6 Ube3a tm1Alb ( B6 AS ; Stock No . 016590 ) . C57BL / 6J mice ( WT ) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory ( Stock No . 000664 ) . While the majority of mice used for these studies were purchased from the breeding colony maintained at JAX laboratories , we also bred mice fromourin - housecolonyatUTHSC , andtheirgenotypewascon ﬁ rmed using previously published protocols 5 , 96 . We used a two - step breeding scheme . Brie ﬂ y , we ﬁ rst crossed female WT with male Ube3a m + / p - to generate heterozygous offspring , in which half of the progeny were Ube3a m + / p - , with no AS phenotype . Ube3a m + / p - heterozygous females were crossed with WT males to generate Ube3a m - / p + mice , in which half of the progeny constitute AS mice displaying the corresponding phe - notype . After con ﬁ rming the genotype , the progenies were used for experiments . All experiments in this work were performed with male mice and their DRG neurons . The effect of the lack of Ube3a was also tested in DRG neurons from female mice ( supplementary Fig . 1f - g ) . Control animals . The Ube3a gene is imprinted in mammals , requiring separate crosses to generate Ube3a m - / p + vs . Ube3a m + / p - animals ( as described above ) . We used both Ube3a m - / p + and Ube3a m + / p - animals on the same strain background generated at the same facility . Since we wantedtoincludethepaternalinheritanceofthe Ube3a - allele ( alsoasa control ) , it was not feasible to test animals from the same cross . Although many studies in the ﬁ eld use an F1 mixed BL6 control , we would argue that using animalsin the same genetic background would be appropriate while only changing the inherited allele ( maternal vs . paternal de ﬁ ciency ) . The only disadvantage to our approach is that when comparing our data to laboratories that use a strict littermate approach , some behaviors may vary slightly . Nevertheless , we showed in our study that Ube3a m - / p + animals alone respond to a dietary inter - vention ( same mice with the same genetic background ) .

Pipettes were made of borosilicate glass ( Sutter Instruments ) and ﬁ re - polished to a resistance between 3 and 5 M Ω before use . Mechanical stimulation was performed using the voltage - clamp ( constant − 60 mV ) or current - clamp con ﬁ guration . Recordings were sampled at 100kHz and low pass ﬁ ltered at 10 kHz using a Mul - tiClamp 700 B ampli ﬁ er and Clampex ( v10 . 4 . 2 . 0 ; Molecular Devices , LLC ) . Leak currents before mechanical stimulation were subtracted of ﬂ ine from the current traces and data were digitally ﬁ ltered at 2 kHz with ClampFit ( v10 . 4 . 2 . 0 ; Molecular Devices , LLC ) . Recordings with leak currents > 200pA , with access resistance > 10M Ω , and cells with giga - seals that did not withstand at least ﬁ ve consecutive steps of mechanical stimulation were excluded from analyses . For human DPSC - derived neurons , cells with giga - seals , notwithstanding at least four consecutive steps of mechanical stimulation , were excluded . Mechanical stimulation For indentation assays , DRG neurons , as well as MCC13 , N2A , Piezo1 – / – N2A , iPSC - and DPSC - derived cells , were mechanically stimulated with a heat - polished blunt glass pipette ( 3 – 4 µ m ) driven by a piezo servo controller ( E625 , Physik Instrumente ) . The blunt pipette was mounted on a micromanipulator at an ~ 45° angle and positioned 3 – 4 µ m above the cells . Displacement measurements were obtained with a square - pulse protocol consisting of 1 µ m incremental indentation steps , each lasting 200 ms with a 2 - ms ramp in 10 - s intervals . The threshold of mechano - activated currents for each experiment was de ﬁ ned as the indentation step that evoked the ﬁ rst current de ﬂ ection from the baseline . For current - clamp experiments , the mechanical threshold was de ﬁ ned as the indentation step that produced the ﬁ rst action potential .

Immunostaining Cultured DRG neurons were ﬁ xed with 3 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100inPBSfor10 min . DRGneuronswerethenincubatedwithahigh - af ﬁ nity F - actin probe , Alexa Fluor 488 TM phalloidin ( 1 : 40 , Thermo - Fisher Scienti ﬁ c # A12379 ) , in PBS for 20 minatRT , followed by a 5min incubation with the nuclear counterstain DAPI ( ThermoFisher Scien - ti ﬁ c # 62248 ) . Samples were preserved using ProLong Antifade Mountant ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c # P36961 ) . Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope with a 63x / 1 . 4 Plan - Apochromat oil immersion objective . Images were processed using ZEN2010 software ( Zeiss ) and analyzed using Fiji ImageJ 103 ( v . 2 . 3 . 0 / 1 . 53q ) to enhance contrast and convert to an appropriate format . Co ﬁ lin ubiquitination assay GFP pulldowns . GFP pulldowns were performed as previously described 46 , 47 , 99 , 104 . Brie ﬂ y , cells were lysed with 300 µ l of lysis buffer and centrifuged at 14 , 000g at 4 °C for 10 min . Supernatants were then diluted with 450 µ l of dilution buffer , except 30 µ l that were kept as input fractions . Afterward , diluted supernatants were incubated with 20 µ l of GFP - Trap - A agarose bead suspension ( Chromotek GmbH ) for 2 h and 30min at room temperature , with gentle rolling . GFP beads were subsequently washed once with 1 ml of dilution buffer , three times with 1 ml of washing buffer , and once with SDS buffer . Bound GFP - tagged Co ﬁ lin was eluted by boiling the GFP beads at 95°C for 10min in 20 µ l of elution buffer . Finally , samples were centrifuged at 16 , 000 g for 2 min to get rid of the GFP - Trap - A agarose beads . Buffer compositions were as follows : lysis buffer − 50mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % Triton , 50 mM N - ethylmaleimide ( Sigma ) , and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) ; dilution buffer − 10mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 50 mM N - ethyl - maleimide , and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail ; washing buffer − 8 M urea , 1 % SDS , 1X PBS ; SDS buffer , 1 % SDS , 1X PBS ; elution buffer − 250mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 40 % glycerol , 4 % SDS , 0 . 2 % bromophenol blue , and 100mM DTT . Western blots .

Proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranesusingtheiBlot system ( Invitrogen ) . Following primary and secondary antibody incubation , membranes were developed by either chemiluminescence , using the Clarity Western ECL Substrate kit ( Bio - Rad ) , or near - infrared ﬂ uorescence . The following primary antibodies were used : mouse monoclonal anti - GFP antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Roche Cat # 11814460001 , RRID : AB _ 390913 ) , mouse monoclonal anti - FLAG M2 - HRP conjugated antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Sigma - Aldrich Cat # A8592 , RRI - D : AB _ 439702 ) , and mouse monoclonal anti - UBE3A ( 1 : 1 , 000 , clone E6AP - 300 ) antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Sigma - Aldrich Cat # E8655 , RRI - D : AB _ 261956 ) . The following secondary antibodies were used : goat anti - mouse - HRP - labeled antibody ( 1 : 4 , 000 ; ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c Cat # 62 - 6520 , RRID : AB _ 2533947 ) and goat anti - mouse IRDye - 800CW ( 1 : 8 , 000 , LI - COR Biosciences Cat # 926 - 32210 , RRID : AB _ 621842 ) . Liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry Control and PUFA - treated Piezo1 – / – N2A cells ( 2 – 4 ×10 6 cells ) , as well as mouse DRGs dissected from mice fed with a standard or LA - enriched diet , were rinsed with PBS three times and ﬂ ash - frozen in liquid N 2 . Total and free fatty acids were extracted and quanti ﬁ ed at the Lipi - domics Core Facility at Wayne State University . Membrane ( i . e . , esteri ﬁ ed ) fatty acids were determined by subtracting free fatty acids from total fatty acids and normalized by cell density or total protein . Differential scanning calorimetry and data analysis A stock solution of 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DPPC , Avanti Polar Lipids ) was prepared in ethanol ( 4mM ) . DPPC solutions were aliquoted , distributed into glass tubes , and mixed with the respective fatty acid ( FA ) at 5 mol % . The solvent was evaporated fromlipidmixturesunderaN 2 streamwhilestirringat55 °Cfor40 min . DPPC / FA ﬁ lms were hydrated with 10mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) at ~ 55°C , followed by vigorous vortex mixing . To yield multilamellar vesicles , mixtures were softly stirred at 600rpm for 40min at 55°C using a Degassing Station ( TA Instruments ) . Samples were degassed at low pressure ( 635mmHg ) for 10 min at 25°C before loading into the DSC capillaries . Heat capacity pro ﬁ les were recorded on a NanoDSC microcalorimeter ( v4 . 8 . 2 ; TA Instruments ) at a constant scan rate of 1 °C / min ( between 25 and 50 °C ) and a constant pressure of 3 atm . Samples were equilibrated for 5 min at 25°C before each experiment . Single thermograms were analyzed with the NanoAnalyze soft - ware ( v3 . 12 . 0 ; TA instruments ) . To evaluate the extent of variation of the lipid organization , we determined the cooperative unit ‘ κ ‘ of the main - phase transition of lipid systems using the following equation 105 : κ = Δ H vH = Δ H cal ð 1 Þ where Δ H cal corresponds to the experimental enthalpy variation pro - vided by the area under the curve of the main transition peak . Δ H vH indicates the van ’ t Hoff enthalpy change , an estimate of the enthalpy associated with a simple two - state ﬁ rst - order transition model , which is given by : Δ H vH = 6 : 9 J K mol (cid:2) T m 2 Δ T 1 = 2 ð 2 Þ whereT m is the melting transition temperature , and Δ T 1 / 2 corresponds to the width at half - height of the transition peak . Calculations were performed through an optimized code on MATLAB ( signal processing toolbox ) .

Catwalk . Gait dynamics were quanti ﬁ ed using the CatWalkXT ( v10 . 0 . 408 ; Noldus , USA ) . Mice were ﬁ rst acclimated to a dark room and the CatWalk instrument over ﬁ ve days for 1h with the illuminated surfaceturnedon . Eachmousecouldwalkfreelyinbothdirectionswith a minimum level of disturbing external elements . The CatWalk system automatically recorded video of the mice walking the entire length of the walkway . Experimental sessions typically lasted 10min , and three compliant runs were recorded per mouse . The CatWalk system deter - mined the compliance ( 60 % ) according tothe run ’ s duration and speed variation . Paw positions were veri ﬁ ed manually after acquisition . Tail - clip . Response to noxious pressure application was determined with the tail - clip assay . Mice were acclimated for 5 min in von Frey chambers . A blunt alligator clip was applied to the middle of the tail and mice were immediately placed back into the von Frey chamber . The latency to lick , bite or grab was scored with a stopwatch . A max - imum cut - off latency of 60 s was imposed to prevent tissue damage . Time to respond was reported as the latency to react for each mouse . Data was analyzed in Excel ( v : 2211 ; Microsoft Corp . ) and plotted using OriginPro 2018 ( v : b9 . 5 . 1 . 195 ; OriginLab Corp . ) . Hot plate . Mice were placed on a heated metal surface ( Ugo Basile ) maintained at 52 ± 0 . 5°C by a feedback - controlled Peltier device ( Harvard Apparatus ) . The latency time between placement and the nociceptivebehavior ( licking , biting , lifting , guarding , shakingthehind paws , or jumping ) was scored . The animal was immediately removed from the apparatus after showing a response . For acclimation , each animal was placed in the inactive chamber for 45 min , one day before the test . A cut - off time of 30 s was established to avoid tissue injury . Data was analyzed in Excel ( v : 2211 ; Microsoft Corp . ) and plotted using OriginPro 2018 ( v : b9 . 5 . 1 . 195 ; OriginLab Corp . ) . Hargreavestest . Pawwithdrawallatenciesweredeterminedbytesting left and right hind paw responses to radiant heat . Latency time to the onset of one of the following nocifensive behaviors was measured : licking , biting , lifting , guarding , or shaking the hind paw . Once a score was determined , the heating was automatically switched off . For acclimatization , mice were placed into the chamber for 1 hour each of the 5 days preceding the test . A cut - off time of 20s was established to avoid tissue injury . Four measurements weretaken per mouse , and the average for each mouse was reported . Data was analyzed in Excel ( v : 2211 ; Microsoft Corp . ) and plotted using OriginPro 2018 ( v : b9 . 5 . 1 . 195 ; OriginLab Corp . ) . Mouse cytokine pro ﬁ le assay Mouse blood was obtained by cardiac puncture under general anes - thesia , and immediately mixed with a 10 % vol . of heparin ( 1000 units / Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 36818 - 0 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 1167 16 ml ; Sagent Pharmaceuticals ) , and spun down at 2 , 000 g for 15 min 106 . Then , the plasma was separated and used for the cytokine pro ﬁ le assay . The cytokine assay was performed with the Mouse Cytokine Array Panel kit ( R & D Systems , Inc . , # ARY006 ) . Brie ﬂ y , the plasma sample was diluted and mixed with a detection antibody cocktail . The mixture was incubated overnight with the mouse cytokine assay membrane at 4 °C . Streptavidin - HRP was added after washes to remove unbound materials , and a chemiluminescent reagents mix was used for detecting cytokine binding . Membranes were imaged in a ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System ( Bio - Rad ) for chemiluminescence . Human iPSC - derived sensory neurons ThehumaniPSClinewasmanufacturedandcharacterizedatAnatomic Incorporated facilities , with informed consent , using proprietary technologies . hiPSCs were differentiated into sensory neurons using a commerciallyavailablekit , Senso - DM , according tothemanufacturer ’ s instructions ( AnatomicIncorporated , # 7007 ) . Brie ﬂ y , undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cell line # 1 ( hiPSC ; from female donor ’ s umbilical cord blood ) was maintained with TeSR ™ - E8 ™ ( STEMCELL Technologies Inc . , 05990 ) ontissue culture - treated plastic that was coated with truncated recombinant human vitronectin ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c # A14700 ) . hiPSCs were dissociated using EDTA ( 0 . 55 mM ) and single cell - seeded into TeSR - E8 supplemented with 10 µ M Y - 27632 ( Selleckchem S1049 ) in ﬂ asks pre - coated with diluted 1 : 100 Matrix 1 in dPBS with Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ( ThermoFisher Sci - enti ﬁ c # 14040 - 133 ) to induce development into primal ectoderm 68 . Subsequent daily media changes of Senso - DM 1 - 7 generated a popu - lation of immature sensory neurons , which were cryopreserved and later thawed for studies . Sensory neurons were maintained in culture at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 on glass coverslips coated with Poly - L - Lysine and Matrix 3 ( Anatomic Incorporated , # M8003 ) in Senso - MM media ( Anatomic Incorporated , # 7008 ) . Human iPSC - derived sensory neu - ronswereincubatedinculturefor14daysbeforerecording . ForsiRNA - mediated knockdown assays , sensory neurons were co - transfected with siGLO Green Transfection Indicator ( Dharmacon ) and siRNA for UBE3A , PIEZO2 , or the silencer negative control ( scrambled siRNA ; described above ) , using the Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent ( ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s protocols , 24h before electrophysiological recording . The transfec - tions were performed using antibiotic - free media . Generation of dental pulp stem cell ( DPSC ) cultures and neuronal differentiation Deciduousteethwereeithercollectedlocally , throughtheDepartment of Pediatric Dentistry ( neurotypical controls ; n = 2 ) , or remotely , for children with AS ( n = 6 ) . Immediately following the loss of the tooth , it wasplaced intransportation media ( DMEM / F12 50 / 50mix with HEPES , 100U / mL penicillin , and 100 μ g / mL streptomycin ) . DPSCs were iso - lated and cultured according to our previously described protocol 72 . Brie ﬂ y , after mincing the dental pulp from inside the tooth cavity , 3 mg / mLdispaseIIand4 mg / mLcollagenaseIwereaddedtodigestthe tissue . Cells were then seeded on Poly - D - Lysine - coated 12 - well plates with media containing DMEM / F12 1 : 1 , 20 % FBS , newborn calf serum ( NCS ) , and 100 U / mL penicillin and 100 μ g / mL streptomycin ( Pen / Strep ) . Con ﬂ uent cultures ( 80 % ) were passaged with TrypLE Express ( Gibco ) , and neuronal differentiation was performed only on early passage cells ( less than four ) . DPSC lines were seeded at 20 , 000 cells / cm 2 on Poly - D - Lysine and Matrigel - coated coverslips with DMEM / F12 1 : 1 , 10 % FBS , 10 % NCS , and Pen / Strep . At 80 % con ﬂ uence , the neuronal differentiation protocol was followed as previously published 71 . Brie ﬂ y , epigenetic repro - gramming was performed by exposing the DPSC to 10 μ M 5 - azacytidine ( Acros Scienti ﬁ c ) in DMEM / F12 containing 2 . 5 % FBS and 10ng / mL bFGF ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) for 48 h . Neural differentiation was induced by exposing the cells to 250 μ M IBMX , 50 μ M forskolin , 200nM TPA , 1mM db - cAMP ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 10 ng / mL bFGF , 10 ng / mL NGF ( Invitrogen ) , 30 ng / mL NT - 3 ( Peprotech ) , and 1 % insulin - transferrin - sodium selenite premix ( ITS ) ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) in DMEM / F12 for 3 days . At the end of neural induction , the cells were washed with 1X PBS . Neuronal maturation was performed by maintaining the cells in Neurobasal A media ( Gibco ) with 1 mM db - cAMP , 2 % B27 , 1 % N2 supplement ( Gibco ) , 30 ng / mL NT - 3 , and 1X Glutamax ( Gibco ) for 30 days . Data analysis Data were plotted using OriginPro ( 2018 v : b9 . 51 . 195 ; OriginLab Corp . ) and Estimation Stats 107 . The time constant of inactivation τ was obtained by ﬁ tting a single exponential function ( 3 ) between the peak value of the current at the end of the stimulus : f t ð Þ = X n i = 1 A i (cid:3) e (cid:4) t = τ i + C ð 3 Þ where A = amplitude , τ = time constant , and the constant y - offset C for each component i . Sigmoidal ﬁ tting was done using OriginPro with the following Boltzmann function : f ð x Þ = A 2 + A 1 (cid:4) A 2 1 + e ðð X (cid:4) X o Þ = dX Þ ð 4 Þ where A 2 = ﬁ nal value , A 1 = initial value ; X o = center , and dX = time constant . All boxplots show mean ( square ) , median ( bisecting line ) , bounds of box ( 75 th to 25 th percentiles ) , and outlier range with 1 . 5 coef ﬁ cient ( whiskers ) . Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad InStat software ( version 3 . 10 ; GraphPad Software Inc . ) and Estimation Stats 107 . We used the Kolmogorov and Smirnov method to determine data distribution , as well as the Bartlett ’ s test to determine differences between standard deviations . Individual tests are described in each of the Fig . legends . Statistics & Reproducibility No statistical method was used to predetermine the sample size . No data were excluded from the analyses . The experiments were not randomized . For electrophysiology , the investigator was blind to genotype and treatment . For behavioral assays , the investigators were blind when possible . All attempts at replication were successful . Experiments were performed at least three times on different days with different / independent preparations .
