Nagel 3 , Eugenio Fava 2 , Yannis Kalaidzidis 1 , 4 & Marino Zerial 1 Endocytosis is a complex process fulfilling many cellular and developmental functions . Understanding how it is regulated and integrated with other cellular processes requires a comprehensive analysis of its molecular constituents and general design principles . Here , we developed a new strategy to phenotypically profile the human genome with respect to transferrin ( TF ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) endocytosis by combining RNA interference , automated high - resolution confocal microscopy , quantitative multiparametric image analysis and high - performance computing . We identified several novel components of endocytic trafficking , including genes implicated in human diseases . We found that signalling pathways such as Wnt , integrin / cell adhesion , transforming growth factor ( TGF ) - b and Notch regulate the endocytic system , and identified new genes involved in cargo sorting to a subset of signalling endosomes . A systems analysis by Bayesian networks further showed that the number , size , concentration of cargo and intracellular position of endosomes are not determined randomly but are subject to specific regulation , thus uncovering novel properties of the endocytic system . Endocytosis is a fundamental process supporting many functions such as nutrient uptake , intracellular signalling 1 , morphogenesis during development 2 and defence against pathogens 3 . Dysfunctions of the endocytic system lead to severe metabolic 4 , infectious 5 and neurodegenerative diseases 6 . Receptors are internalized by both Clathrin - dependent and - independent mechanisms into early endo - somes and , from here , follow different intracellular routes . For example , transferrin ( TF ) is recycled back to the plasma membrane , whereas epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) is routed to late endosomes / lysosomes for degradation . Despite a great deal of molecular insights 7 – 9 our understanding of the endocytic machinery remains fragmentary . Furthermore , the design principles of the endocytic pathway , its integration in the overall cellular system and high - order control are still largely unknown . Addressing these problems requires methods capable of seizing the complexity at the system level ( that is , measuring many key parameters ) . Here , we designed a new analytical approach aimed at phenotypi - cally profiling genes with respect to endocytosis by genome - wide RNAi screening through the quantitative assessment of many system parameters . Multiparametric profiling of the endocytic system We visualized endocytosis of fluorescent TF and EGF in HeLa cells before we could apply our platform to more disease - relevant systems . After small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) transfection , cells internalized the two cargo markers simultaneously for 10min , were fixed , stained with 4 9 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) / SYTO42 blue for nuclei and cytoplasm detection , and imaged ( 12 images per well ) by triple - colour high - resolution automated confocal microscopy ( Fig . 1a ) . Insteadof performinga phenotypic evaluation onthebasisof single or few parameters as commonly done in previous screens 10 , 11 , we developed a quantitative multiparametric image analysis ( QMPIA ) platform , on the basis of the custom - designed image analysis software MotionTracking 12 . First , images were segmented to determine mor - phological and positional descriptors for each endosome ( Fig . 1b ) . Second , a total setof 62 parameterswere extracted , 4 servingas quality control to reject sub - optimal images and 58 describing defined bio - logical properties of the endocytic system , such as total internal cargo , number , size ( mean apparent area ) and position of endosomes ( Fig . 1c , Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Information for details ) . The latter were processed to suppress plate - to - plate random variations , normalized ( see Supplementary Information ) and the 46 most robust parameters ( see Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 1 ) were combined into multiparametric profiles ( Fig . 1d ) describing quantitatively the endocytic phenotypes . In preparation for the genomic screen , we validated the quality and reproducibility of assay and QMPIA . First , we verified that the deple - tion of established components of the endocytic machinery , such as Clathrin ( CLTC ) , Dynamin - 2 ( DNM2 ) , EGF receptor ( EGFR ) , Transferrin receptor ( TFRC ) , early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) and others by RNAi ( Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 ) , yielded the expected alterations in phenotypic profiles . For example , silencing of TFRC reduced the values of number of endosomes , total internal cargo and mean cargo load per endosome for TF but not EGF ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . Conversely , EGFR downregulation per - turbed the parameters of EGF but not of TF ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . Second , we validated the use of a single confocal section as representa - tive of the three - dimensional endosomal population of the entire cell ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Third , we validated the reproducibility of the observed phenotypic profiles using the same and different siRNAs targeting the same gene for a set of 78 genes and 468 siRNA ( 6 siRNAs per gene ) . We found that profiles of the same siRNAs were highly reproducible ( Fig . 2a ) ( mean Pearson correlation coefficient 0 . 6 6 0 . 02 s . e . m . ) , compared with other monoparametric screens 13 1 Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , 2 High - Throughput Technology Development Studio , MPI - CBG , Pfotenhauerstrasse 108 , 01307 Dresden , Germany . 3 CenterforInformationServicesandHighPerformanceComputing ( ZIH ) , DresdenUniversityofTechnology , D - 01062Dresden , Germany . 4 BelozerskyInstituteofPhysico - Chemical Biology , Moscow State University , 119899 , Moscow , Russia . { Present addresses : University of Utah School of Medicine , 401 MREB , 20 North 1900 East , Salt Lake City , Utah 84132 - 3401 , USA ( J .

All rights reserved ©2010 ( see Supplementary Information ) , indicating that the experimental noise is not increased by the higher complexity of theassay . In contrast , different siRNAs targeting the same gene frequently yielded different profiles ( Fig . 2b ) ( mean Pearson correlation coefficient 0 . 047 6 0 . 01 s . e . m . ) , consistent with high incidence of RNAi off - target 13 – 17 . As we excluded variations in protein depletion and silencing of alternatively spliced transcripts ( data not shown ) , the major cause of incoherence between profiles of different siRNAs is most probably off - target effects . Gene phenotypic profiling Assuming that each siRNA profile has both ‘on - target’ and ‘off - target’ phenotypic components , we exploited the QMPIA to suppress as much as possible the latter contaminant . For this , we developed a probabilistic approach to infer gene - specific phenotypesby‘averaging’ theprofilesofdifferentsiRNAstargetingthesamegene . Wedefinedthe ‘gene profile’ as the most probable profile calculated as mode of the a posteriori joint probability distribution considering all individual siRNA profiles for a given gene . Notably , here every siRNA targeting a given gene contributes , to a different extent , to the determination of gene profiles ( see Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , circumventing the need of similarity thresholds to define supporting siRNAs ( 2 of 3 , 3 of 3 , and so on ) 18 . Gene profiles instead of individual siRNA profiles were sub - sequently used for phenotypic clustering and gene classification . As test , we screened 1 , 000 genes including 35 known endocytic regulators ( Supplementary Table 2 ) and 92 kinases identified in a previous screen 19 ( Supplementary Table 3 ) using seven siRNAs per gene . On the basis of the QMPIA , 31 of the 35 endocytic regulator genes ( , 90 % ) and 62outof92kinasegenespresenteda x 2 probability ( 1 . 0 2 P ) $ 0 . 95 corresponding to a statistically significant enrich - ment ( P 5 1 . 1 3 10 2 11 and P 5 5 3 10 2 12 , respectively ) in the list of scores . Interestingly , only 7 out of the 35 endocytic regulators would have scored considering only two parameters ( EGF and TF total internal cargo ) . Altogether , these data indicate that the QMPIA has the advantage of higher comprehensiveness and specificity over monoparametric read - outs in the identification of genes regulating endocytic trafficking . Genome - wide survey of EGF and TF endocytosis To improve accuracy and coverage in the survey , we screened directly in the primary assay three genomic libraries , two siRNA and one endoribonuclease - prepared siRNA ( esiRNA ) 15 , corresponding to 20 μ m 20 μ m a c Synthetic b EGFTFDAPI Multi - parametric analysis Endosome parameter groups / cargo G1 .

This approach presents two major advantages . First , the high number of si / esiRNAs analysed by QMPIA reduces the impact of false negatives owing to disagreement between siRNAs . Second , reproducibility of phenotypes is assessed already in the primary screen for all genes ( not just the hits ) . We acquired 12 images per sample to obtain statistically significant data , accounting for a total of , 2 . 5 3 10 6 images . Quality controls for transfection efficiency , QMPIA and toxicity ( see Methods ) were included in each plate ( see Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Image analysis and gene profile determination required , 4 . 5 3 10 6 CPU hours of calculation on a 2 , 584 - cores com - puter cluster . Phenotypic clustering and gene scoring As our aim was not to identify a few hit genes but rather to conduct a systemsanalysis , weexploited themultidimensionalityof gene profiles . First , we clustered all genes of the human genome using mean - shift clustering 20 ( seeSupplementaryInformation ) . Weidentified14pheno - typic cluster groups ( Fig . 3 ) stable over a wide range of the algorithm parameters , indicating that the endocytic system is under constraints and changes between a discrete set of possible states in response to perturbations . Second , genes were scored on the basis of two criteria , phenotype amplitude ( probability of x 2 ) and presence of specific phenotypic traits ( defined as the cluster group profiles ; ‘pheno - score’ ; Supplementary Information ) , as shown in Supplementary Fig . 6 , providing both strong and mild , but specific , phenotypes . A list of 4 , 609 genes , 3 , 804 with a ‘strong’ and 805 with a ‘mild’ phenotype was compiled ( Supplementary Table 4 ; images and profiles available at http : / / gwsdisplayer . mpi - cbg . de ) . Considering both the design of the assay and the integration of endocytosis with many cellular processes , such a large number was expected because , besides the ‘core’ endocytic machinery , manygeneshaveadirectorindirectroleinendocytosis . For comparison with the common practices in the field , we estimated that screening a single library ( 2 – 3 siRNAs per gene ) with a typical two - parameter assay and validating the hits with an independent set of si / esiRNAs ( 4 – 5 ) would yield only 336 genes ( data not shown ) , indicating that the large number of genes in the list results from ( 1 ) a broader window of detection ( many parameters ) and ( 2 ) high number of si / esiRNAs screened rather than permissive criteria for selection . To estimate the reproducibility of the hits , we re - screened twice the kinome - phosphatome ( 9 , 330 siRNAs , 1 , 459 genes ) , including a large fraction of the gene hits ( 235 ) . We observed 84 % reproducibility for ‘strong’ and 72 . 5 % for ‘mild’ phenotypes . Nevertheless , to assign a better probabilistic value to the scores , the genes in the list will be re - screened ( the web database will be updated ) . The silencing efficacy of thelibrarieswasassessedbythemanufacturersbyquantitativeRT – PCR ( qRT – PCR ) on a set of siRNAs and we independently confirmed it by western blotting ( see Methods and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) .

Some genes ( 17 % ; 798 ; P 5 1 3 10 2 36 ) were ‘unknown’ owing to absence of curated annotations . We found several novel potential endocytic regulators such as four TBC domain - containing proteins ( MGC16169 ( also known as TBCK ) , TBC1D9 , TBC1D9B , TBC1D21 ) , two FYVE - finger proteins ( MTMR4 and WDFY1 ) , and a protein with a VPS9 domain ( RINL ) . Notably , the list was enriched in genes implicated in different human diseases ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database ; see Supplementary Information ) such as different cancers ( for example , glioma ( P 5 1 . 26 3 10 2 8 ) , colorectal ( P 5 5 . 53 3 10 2 6 ) , pancreatic cancer ( P 5 8 . 92 3 10 2 6 ) etc . ) , neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders ( for example , dentatorubral - pallidoluysian atrophy ; P 5 7 . 8 3 10 2 3 ) , Huntington disease ( P 5 0 . 026 ) and type II diabetes ( P 5 3 . 7 3 10 2 3 ) . Regulation by metabolic and signalling pathways The cluster analysis provided insights into how endocytosis is inte - grated with other cellular functions andmade predictions concerning the function of uncharacterized genes . Many cluster groups were anti - correlated ( Fig . 3a – e and Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) , reflecting positive and negative regulation on the endocytic system . For example , ablation of genes in cluster groups 1 and 2 increased and decreased the amount of internalized TF , respectively ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . Interestingly , genes of metabolic pathways were highly enriched in cluster group 1 , most probably reflecting a compensatory response to a metabolic deficit by generally increasing endocytosis of nutrients . Another example of anti - correlated phenotypes is provided by cluster groups 3 and 4 ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 8b ) , where the endosomes were localized either closer to or more distant from the nuclei , respectively . We found enrichment ( P 5 0 . 022 in cluster group 3 and P 5 2 . 3 3 10 2 3 in cluster group 4 ) of components of the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton ( for example , RAC1 , ROCK2 , CAPZB , microtubule and actin motors KIF20A and MYH9 ) . Interestingly , in cluster group 4 we found genes involved in cytokin - esis such as CEP55 ( ref . 23 ) and KIF20A ( ref . 24 ) , strengthening the link with endocytosis 25 . Cluster groups 8 and 10 contained several known endocytic com - ponents . Cluster group 8 ( decreased internal TF and EGF ; Fig . 3d ) contained many genes encoding components required for endocytic uptake , such as CLTC , DNM2 and phosphatidylinositol kinases / phosphatases ( INPP4A , INPP5B , PIB5PA , INPPL1 ; P 5 1 . 48 3 10 2 7 ) . Cluster group 10 contained several endosomal regulators such as Rabankyrin - 5 ( ANKFY1 ) 26 , Rabenosyn - 5 ( ZFYVE20 ) 27 and Hrs ( HGS ) , indicating that EGF endocytosis is particularly susceptible to depletion of PI ( 3 ) P effectors . On the basis of these results , we predict that many new components of the endocytic core machinery are in these cluster groups . Signalling pathways exert distinct effects on the endocytic system . Here we confirmed the activity of mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , Ca 2 1 , integrin / cell adhesion and mTOR signalling path - ways 19 , 28 and uncovered the activity of several new ones , TGF - b / activin , Wnt and Notch . Some ( MAPK , Ca 2 1 , mTOR , Wnt ) had a wide range of effects on the endocytic system ( enriched in several cluster groups ; not shown ) but others produced very specific effects ( enriched in single or opposite groups ) . For example , in cluster groups 3 and 4 we found enrichment in the integrin / cell adhesion pathway ( P 5 0 . 012 in cluster group 3 and P 5 6 . 6 3 10 2 4 in cluster group 4 ; ITGA5 , ITGB1 , ITGA9 , PAK1 , MAPK9 , MAPK1 ) . Interestingly , the Notch and TGF - b pathways were enriched ( P 5 0 . 026 and P 5 5 . 6 3 10 2 3 , respectively ) in cluster group 8 ( reduced total internal cargo for both EGF and TF ) . As we excluded the possibility that the reduction in total internal cargo was due to downregulation of surface receptors ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) , we sug - gest a new role of these pathways in the regulation of endocytic uptake . We found for the Notch pathway NOTCH4 , PSENEN and PSEN2 , MAML1 and RBPJ and for the TGF - b pathway several genes encoding for activin receptors ( ACVR1B , ACVR2A , ACVR2B and ACVRL1 ) . In conclusion , the cluster analysis assigns new functions to meta - bolic and signalling pathways and further predicts functions for new genes in endocytosis . Differential regulation of TF and EGF trafficking To reveal general design principles of the endocytic system we con - sidered all , 160 , 000 knockdown conditions as independent per - turbed states of the system and determined correlations between parameters . A first interesting aspect emerging from such analysis was a high divergence in EGF and TF endocytosis . Despite the good correlation between the size of EGF - and TF - positive endosomes ( Fig . 4a ) and their intracellular localization ( Fig . 4b ) , we found an unexpected low correlation between the levels of total internal cargo ( Fig . 4c ) of the two markers . These results strongly indicate that although the molecular regulators of endosome size and distance from nucleus are essentially shared by EGF and TF , the machineries controlling internalization and sorting are largely distinct . We exclude a major contribution of alternative non - clathrin - dependent entry pathways 29 under our experimental conditions , because deple - tion of CLTC almost completely blocked the uptake of both cargo markers ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . One possible interpretation is that EGF and TF may preferentially be internalized into endocytic vesicles subjected to different regulation . For example , depletion of AP - 2 complex specifically reduces TF but not EGF internalization ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) 30 , whereas knockdown of other genes such as PLEKHB2 , CCDC33 and RCHY1 specifically downregulated EGF internalization . Interestingly , silencing of certain genes resulted in the dispersal of EGF into small , peripheral endosomes ( Fig . 4e ) , a pattern reminiscent of APPL1 - endosomes 31 . These endosomes are largely distinct from canonical EEA1 - positive early endosomes 31 and act as signalling plat - forms 32 . Knockdown of ZFYVE20 , ANKFY1 , PIK3R1 , PIK3R2 along withnovelgenessuchas CCDC128 ( alsoknownas KLRAQ1 ) , C12orf4 , MGC16169 ( also known as TBCK ) specifically affected EEA1 - positive endosomes ( Fig . 4d – e ) and increased the colocalization of EGF with APPL1 ( Fig . 4h – i ) . Conversely , knockdown of INPP5B and RABEP1 specifically affected APPL1 - positive endosomes ( Fig . 4d – f ) and con - comitantly decreased their colocalization with EGF ( Fig . 4h – i ) . Altogether , we identified new components that regulate the sorting of EGF to APPL1 - positive endosomes . New design principles of the endocytic system Our analysis also showed that various endosomal parameters are significantly correlated and , therefore , functionally linked . For both EGF ( Fig . 5a – c ) and TF , we observed a negative correlation between mean size and number of endosomes , a positive correlation between the number of endosomes and their mean distance from nucleus and a negative correlation between endosome size and distance from nucleus . Total internal cargo and cargo concentration per endosome ( Fig . 5d ) as well as number of endosomes ( Fig . 5e ) were also strongly correlated positively . In contrast , there was no correlation between total internal cargo and endosome size ( Fig . 5f ) and their distance from nucleus ( not shown ) . The analysis of pair correlations indicate that the endocytic para - meters are functionally linked , but does not infer cause – effect rela - tionships . To infer directionality in these relationships and learn general rules underlying the organization of the endocytic system , we performed a Bayesian network analysis . The structure of Bayesian networks is a directed acyclic graph where nodes denote the variables of interest and edges correspond to logical dependencies between ARTICLES NATURE | Vol 464 | 11 March 2010 246 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©2010 them 33 . We constructed two Bayesian networks for EGF and TF ( Fig . 5g – h ) , where the nodes correspond to the ‘key’ phenotypic parameters and the edges to their pair correlation . The two networks shared a similar structure . Surprisingly , for both EGF and TF the parameter measuring endosome distance from nucleus was found to influence other parameters , indicating a key regulatory role in the endocytic system . The dependencies between the triplet endo - some distance from nucleus – number – size reflect a progression from many small peripheral to few large perinuclear endosomes . Genes involved in protein ubiquitination were found enriched among the regulators of this process ( cluster group 4 P 5 0 . 032 ) .

All rights reserved ©2010 including cullins catalysing ubiquitin ligation 34 and other genes such as FBXO22 , FBXO30 , FBXO46 , FBXO6 , USP31 and HECTD3 , indi - cating a new role of protein ubiquitination in the endosomal spatio - temporal progression . However , the two networks also presented some interesting differ - ences . The negative dependency of endosome cargo content on dis - tance from nucleus reflects a progressive concentration of EGF in endosomes , in contrast to TF that is continuously removed and recycled to the surface . A comparison of the triplet concentration – size – content revealed some unexpected properties of the endocytic system . The TF network has a structure typical of passively sorted membrane proteins , where cargo content depends on size and con - centration of cargo per endosome . In contrast , the mean concentra - tion of EGF in the endosomes is adjusted so that the mean total content of EGF per endosome remains constant , independently of endosome size ( negative dependence of the size on the concentration and no correlation between size and content ) . Such a mechanism cannotbeexplainedonlybysortingofEGFintointra - luminalvesicles 9 , because ( 1 ) thisisinconsistentwiththehighcorrelationbetweensizeof EGF and TF endosomes and ( 2 ) the knockdown of HGS ( Hrs ) and TSG101 ( ref . 9 ) doesnotalterthesize – concentration – contentrelation - ship . These data rather indicate the existence of a quasi - deterministic mechanism tightly coupling fusion and fission events to regulate the concentration of EGF in each endosome . Finally , the cell exerts a tighter control on the number of EGF - than TF - positive endosomes , as indicated by the stronger dependence on total internal cargo ( corr EGF 5 0 . 61 vs corr TF 5 0 . 16 ) . In other words , to increase cargo capacity the system in addition to concentrating EGF in endosomes ( as for TF ) also generates new endosomes . Altogether , thesefindingsindicatethatthecellregulatesthenumber , size , loading and , therefore , the intracellular density of EGF - bearing endosomes . These findings have profound implications for the role of endosomes in signalling 31 , 35 , 36 . Discussion As a first step towards a systems analysis of endocytosis , we profiled the human genome relative to a set of 58 parameters that quantita - tively describe endocytic features . From this survey we could attri - bute new functions to known and unknown ( 798 ) genes with respect to EGF and TF endocytosis . Furthermore , we revealed unexpected properties of the endocytic system . First , we uncovered the effect of various signalling pathways , notably integrin / cell adhesion , TGF - b , Notch and Wnt , on both TF and EGF endocytosis . The activity of these pathways depends on endocytosis 37 – 39 , but our data further indicate that they exert a feedback mechanism on the endocytic machinery . Interestingly , TGF - b , Notch and Wnt pathways have been implicated in the regulation of epithelial – mesenchymal trans - ition ( EMT ) 40 , cell - fate determination 41 and tissue morphogenesis 42 and given the established role of endocytosis in these events 2 , 43 , we propose that part of their morphogenetic activity depends on their effects on the endocytic pathway . Second , a surprising result was the low correlation between genes regulating TF and EGF endocytosis ( Figs 5g – h and 4a – c ) . Differences in the molecular machinery regu - lating cargo uptake and recycling have been reported 30 , but such a degree of diversity is unprecedented . Third , our analysis provided insights into the design principles underlying the endocytic system . The fact that the endosome distance from the nucleus is a key regulatory parameter demonstrates directly that the spatio - temporal progression of endosomes observed in living cells 12 is not an epiphe - nomenon but has a fundamental role in the function of the endocytic system . The many components of the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton identified in the screen ( cluster groups 3 and 4 ) provide insights into the molecular regulation underlying this mechanism . An interesting aspect emerging from the comparison of the EGF and TF Bayesian networks is that the cell specifically regulates the number of EGF - positive endosomes , and strictly couples size and concentration of cargo in endosomes . Given that endosomes can act as intracellular signalling platforms 32 , 35 , the system might regulate the concentration of EGF and the number of EGF - positive endo - somes to quantitatively control signalling responses , for example , for different cell - fate decisions , as shown for the MAPK network 44 . Regulating the density of receptor tyrosine kinases , and number and distribution of endosomes may be necessary to calibrate the concen - tration of signalling molecules and their signalling output . In iden - tifying genes that selectively affect cargo transport to APPL1 - positive endosomes , we unveiled a sorting mechanism to distribute cargo to this compartment . This is the beginning of a more detailed molecular characterization of APPL1 endosomes , their regulation of transport and their role in signal propagation 32 , 35 . However , a limitation of our approach remains the poor identification of highly homologous and functionally redundant genes ( for example , RAB5A , B , C and so on ) . This could be overcome by combinations of several siRNAs , as for CBL , CBLB and CBLC ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . This exploratory endeavour required uncommon resources for a primary screen . Nevertheless , it was necessary to establish the condi - tions for streamlining the technology and rendering such genomic profiling easier and more affordable in the future . Several genes iden - tified in the screen are associated with human diseases , confirming the fundamental role of endocytosis in the pathogenesis of many human diseasesandprovidingnovelpotentialdrugtargets . Itwillbeimportant to determine which parameters of the QMPIA might act as physio - pathological indicators reflecting disease - relevant alterations . When applied to primary cells and disease model systems , the screening plat - form described here will reveal its true potential for drug discovery , through the identification of novel therapeutic targets , new mechan - ismsofaction , andfordiscerningtherapeuticeffectsofsmallmolecules from toxic ones . METHODS SUMMARY RNAi screen for endocytosis . HeLa cells were reverse transfected with three genomic libraries ( Ambion , Qiagen and a custom - made esiRNA library 15 ) using 20nM siRNAs or 25ng per well esiRNAs . Seventy - two hours after transfection , cellswereincubatedwith100ngml 2 1 EGF - Alexa488and5 m gml 2 1 Transferrin – Alexa 647 ( Molecular Probes ) in serum - free medium for 10min at 37 u C before fixation with formaldehyde . Thereafter , nuclei and cytoplasm were stained with 0 . 4 m gml 2 1 DAPI and 0 . 2 m M SYTO42 blue ( Molecular Probes ) . Automated image acquisition . Triple - colour images were acquired in a fully automated and unbiased manner using a spinning disk confocal microscope ( OPERA , Evotec Technologies - PerkinElmer ) and a 3 40 water immersion objective ( NA 5 0 . 9 ) . Twelveimagesperwellwerecollectedtoobtainasufficient number of cells for reliable statistical analysis . Image correction and image analysis were performed using custom designed image analysis software ( MotionTracking ; see Supplementary Information ) . EEA1 - APPL1 endosome dissection of EGF trafficking . Genes of interest ( 78 ) were screened to detect alterations in the EEA1 - or APPL1 - positive endosomes with respect to EGF trafficking . Following siRNA transfection and EGF – Alexa 488 internalization , cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti - EEA1 ( BD Biosciences ; Pharmingen ) and rabbit polyclonal anti - APPL1 ( ref . 31 ) antibodies and quadruple - colour images were acquired as described ( Methods ) . Detection of surface receptors . To exclude changes in the level of surface recep - tors upon downregulation of Notch and TGF - b signalling pathways , cells were transfected with si / esiRNAs targeting these genes and 1 , 034 randomly selected si / esiRNAs , incubated with 100ngml 2 1 EGF – Alexa 488 and 5 m gml 2 1 TF – Alexa 647 ( Molecular Probes ) in serum - free medium for 30min on ice , fixed and stained with DAPI - SYTO42 as described earlier . Signals were enhanced by stain - ing with a rabbit anti - Alexa 488 ( Molecular Probes ) and mouse monoclonal antibodies against the ectodomain of human TFRC ( BD Biosciences ; Pharmingen ) without permeabilization . Triple - colour images ( ten per well ) were collected with a 3 20 water immersion objective ( NA 5 0 . 7 ) as described earlier .

All rights reserved ©2010 METHODS siRNA and esiRNA libraries and remapping to RefSeq 28 . Three genomic RNAilibraries , twocommercialsiRNAlibraries ( AmbionSilencerGenomewide siRNA Library V . 3 and Qiagen Human Whole Genome siRNA Library V . 1 ) and a custom - made esiRNA library 15 were screened . The Ambion library included 51 , 880 siRNAs targeting 22 , 527 genes in the human genome and was designed partlyonthebasisoftheRefSeqdatabaseRelease15andpartlyontheENSEMBLdatabase . The Qiagen library , which included 91 , 956 siRNAs targeting 22 , 732 genes , was entirely designed on the basis of the RefSeq database ( kinase / phosphatase and gpcr subsets : Refseq Release 18 , Druggable Genome Set : Refseq Release 17 , the rest of the Whole Genome Set and the Predicted Genes Set RefSeq Release 12 ) . The esiRNA library was prepared as described previ - ously 13 andincluded17 , 188esiRNAstargeting16 , 722humangenes , designedon the basis of the ENSEMBL ( Release 36 ) database . Ambion and Qiagen validated 768 and 3 , 073 siRNAs by qRT – PCR , respectively . Out of these , 740 ( Ambion ) and 3 , 072 ( Qiagen ) were shown to be efficient ( . 70 % reduction ) at silencing their corresponding target mRNAs , providing an overall estimated efficiency of . 95 % for the Ambion and . 99 % for the Qiagen libraries , respectively . The sequences of all 3 libraries were remapped on the RefSeq Release 28 database by BLAST . ThesequenceofansiRNAoresiRNAwasmappedtoagivengeneonthe basis of the following three conditions : ( 1 ) 19 / 19 bases match on a region on the mRNA , ( 2 ) matching with all transcripts ( including differentially spliced mRNAs ) of a given gene , ( 3 ) absence of matching with any other transcripts from other genes . All siRNAs / esiRNAs that did not meet these conditions were discarded from further analysis . After re - mapping to RefSeq Release 28 , the 3 libraries covered 33 , 223 genes of which 28 , 279 encode for proteins or contain an open reading frame , corresponding to 62 % coverage of the transcriptome and 73 % of the proteome . HT RNAi transfection and endocytic assay . HeLa cells were reverse transfected with20nMsiRNAsor25ngperwellesiRNAs ( finalconcentration ) with0 . 2 m lper wellOligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) inatotalvolumeof50 m l . ForHT - transfectiona ‘Freedom Evo’ pipetting robot ( Tecan ) equipped with a 384 - fixed - needle - head , an 8 - needle - pipettor and a gripper was used under a customized biological safety cabinet . Afullyautomatedworkflowpreparedtransfectioncomplexesin384wells at a throughput of 5 plates / 50min ( manuscript submitted ) . For cell seeding and dispensing the assay solutions the MTP dispensers WellMate and Multidrop 384 ( ThermoScientific ) wereused ; washprocedureswereperformedusingthePower Washer 384 ( Tecan ) . Briefly , 10 m l of200nMsiRNAsor 5ng m l 2 1 esiRNAsweremixed with10 m lof pre - diluted Oligofectamine ( 40 m lml 2 1 OptiMem ) for 15min to allow complex formation . Subsequently , 10 m l of this mixture were placed in 384 - well CellCarrierplates ( EvotecTechnologies ) . HeLacells ( 1000cellsperwell , counted with CASY Model TT , Scha¨rfe System ) were seeded in 40 m l per well . Plates were incubatedfor72hat37 u Cand5 % CO 2 . Thereafter , thecellswereincubatedwith 100ngml 2 1 EGF – Alexa 488 and 5 m gml 2 1 transferrin – Alexa 647 ( Molecular Probes ) in serum - free medium for 10min at 37 u C . Cells were subsequently washedwithPBS and fixedwith3 . 7 % formaldehyde . Nuclei andcytoplasmwere stained with 0 . 4 m gml 2 1 DAPI and 0 . 2 m M SYTO42 blue ( Molecular Probes ) . For the analysis of protein downregulation , cells were grown in 96 - well plates and transfected with 20nM siRNAs ( final concentration ) with 0 . 3 m l per well Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) in a total volume of 100 m l . After 72h total protein extracts were prepared and analysed by quantitative western blotting using antibodies against EEA1 , ZFYVE20 and ANKFY1 . Automated spinning disk confocal imaging . Twelve images per well were col - lectedwitha 3 40waterimmersionobjective ( NA 5 0 . 9 ) inafullyautomatedand unbiased manner with a spinning disk confocal microscope ( OPERA , Evotec Technologies - Perkin Elmer ) . Triple - colour images were acquired in two sequen - tial exposures by three different CCD cameras : the Alexa 488 signal was collected inafirstexposureusing488nmlaserlightanda540 / 75band - passfilter ; Alexa647 andDAPI - SYTO42bluesignalswerecollectedinasecondexposureusing635nm and405nmlaser light andwith 700 / 90and450 / 50band - passfilters , respectively . Images were subsequently corrected ( MotionTracking ; see Supplementary Information ) for uneven field illumination and chromatic aberrations according to reference images . For reference , images of 2 . 5 m m multicolour beads , and images of reference dyes and dark field images were collected using the Opera Adjustment Plate ( Evotec Technologies - Perkin Elmer ) . Three - dimensional imaging of the endosome distribution of the cell was per - formed on a small set of 27 siRNAs ( targeting 10 genes of the human genome ) . Using the same microscope and automated imaging protocols as above 10 focal planes with 0 . 5 m m steps were acquired . EEA1 - APPL1endosomedissectionof EGF trafficking . Asmallersetof78genes was further screened to detect alterations in the EEA1 - or APPL1 - positive endo - someswith respect to EGF trafficking . Forthis , cellswere transfected , EGF – Alexa 488 was internalized and cells were fixed as above . Cells were then permeabilized with 0 . 1 % saponin and 0 . 2 % fish gelatin ( as blocking agent ) and subsequently stained with mouse monoclonal anti - EEA1 ( BD Biosciences Pharmingen ) and rabbit polyclonal anti - APPL1 ( ref . 31 ) antibodies . Fluorescently conjugated goat anti - rabbit – Alexa 568 and goat anti - mouse – Alexa 647 secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) revealed the antigen signals and DAPI - SYTO 42 blue stained the nuclei and cytoplasm . Quadruple - colour confocal images were collected ( OPERA , Evotec Technologies - PerkinElmer ) in two sequential exposures : Alexa 488 and Alexa 647 signals were collected in a first exposure using 488nm and635nmlaserlightandwith540 / 75and690 / 50bandpassfilters ; Alexa568and DAPI - SYTO42bluesignalswerecollectedinasecondexposureusing405nmand 561nm laser light and with 450 / 50 and 605 / 40 band - pass filters , respectively . Reference images were acquired and image correction performed as before . doi : 10 . 1038 / nature08779 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©2010
