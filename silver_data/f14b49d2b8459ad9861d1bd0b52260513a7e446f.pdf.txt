Summary DNA cytosine methylation is a central epigenetic modification that plays essential roles in cellular processes including genome regulation , development and disease . Here we present the first genome - wide , single - base resolution maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome , from both human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts , along with comparative analysis of mRNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome , several histone modifications , and sites of DNA - protein interaction for several key regulatory factors . Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes . Nearly one - quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non - CG context , suggesting that they Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to J . R .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t may utilize different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation . Methylation in non - CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers . Non - CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells , and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells . We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation , and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity . These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development . Thirty - four years have passed since Riggs , Holliday and Pugh proposed that cytosine DNA methylation in eukaryotes could act as a stably inherited modification affecting gene regulation and cellular differentiation 1 , 2 . Since then , intense research effort has expanded our understanding of diverse aspects of DNA methylation in higher eukaryotic organisms . These include elucidation of molecular pathways required for establishing and maintaining DNA methylation , cell - type specific variation in methylation patterns , and the involvement of methylation in multifarious cellular processes such as gene regulation , DNA - protein interactions , cellular differentiation , suppression of transposable elements , embryogenesis , X - inactivation , genomic imprinting and tumorigenesis 3 – 9 . DNA methylation , together with covalent modification of histones , is thought to alter chromatin density and accessibility of the DNA to cellular machinery , thereby modulating the transcriptional potential of the underlying DNA sequence 10 . Genome - wide studies of mammalian DNA methylation have previously been conducted , however they have been limited by low resolution 11 , sequence - specific bias , or complexity reduction approaches that analyze only a very small fraction of the genome 12 – 14 . In order to improve our understanding of the genome - wide patterns of DNA methylation we have generated single - base resolution DNA methylation maps throughout the majority of the human genome in both embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts . Furthermore , we have profiled several important histone modifications , protein - DNA interaction sites of regulatory factors , and the mRNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome to better understand how changes in DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications may affect readout of the proximal genetic information . Single - base resolution maps of DNA methylation for two human cell lines Single - base DNA methylomes of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana were previously achieved using MethylC - Seq15 or BS - Seq16 . In this method , genomic DNA is treated with sodium bisulfite ( BS ) to convert cytosine , but not methylcytosine , to uracil , and subsequent high - throughput sequencing . We performed MethylC - Seq for two human cell lines , H1 human embryonic stem cells17 and IMR90 fetal lung fibroblasts18 , generating 1 . 16 and 1 . 18 billion reads , respectively , that aligned uniquely to the human reference sequence ( NCBI build 36 / HG18 ) . The total sequence yield was 87 . 5 and 91 . 0 gigabases ( Gb ) , with an average read depth of 14 . 2× and 14 . 8× per strand for H1 and IMR90 , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . In each cell type , over 86 % of both strands of the 3 . 08 Gb human reference sequence are covered by at least one sequence read ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) , accounting for 94 % of the cytosines in the genome . We detected approximately 62 million and 45 million methylcytosines in H1 and IMR90 cells , respectively ( 1 % FDR , see Supplementary Materials , Fig . 1a ) , comprising 5 . 83 % and 4 . 25 % of the cytosines with sequence coverage . Full browsing of the entire dataset at single base resolution can be performed at http : / / neomorph . salk . edu / human _ methylome using the AnnoJ browser ( www . annoj . org ) . Of the methylcytosines detected in the IMR90 genome , 99 . 98 % were in the CG context , and the total number of mCG sites was very similar in both cell types . Lister et al . Page 2 Nature .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t In the H1 stem cells we detected abundant DNA methylation in non - CG contexts ( mCHG and mCHH , where H = A , C or T ) , comprising almost 25 % of all cytosines at which DNA methylation is identified , and accounting for most of the difference in total methylcytosine number between the cell types ( Fig . 1a ) . The prevailing assumption is that mammalian DNA methylation is located almost exclusively in the CG context , however a handful of studies have previously detected non - CG methylation in human cells , and in particular in embryonic stem cells 19 , 20 . Bisulfite - PCR , cloning and sequencing of selected loci displaying H1 non - CG methylation in several human cell lines revealed that a second embryonic stem cell line , H9 17 , displayed mCHG and mCHH at conserved positions , confirming that non - CG methylation is likely a general feature of human ES cells ( Fig . 2 , Supplementary Table 2 ) . In addition , like IMR90 cells , BMP4 - induced H1 cells lost non - CG methylation at several loci examined while methylation in the CG context was maintained , indicating that the pervasive non - CG methylation is lost upon differentiation . Furthermore , analysis of these loci in IMR90 induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells revealed restored non - CG methylation ( Fig . 2 ) . Overall this demonstrates that the CHG and CHH methylation identified in H1 and absent in IMR90 are not simply due to genetic differences between the two cell types , but rather the presence of non - CG methylation is characteristic of an embryonic stem cell state . For each cell type , two biological replicates were performed with cells of different passage number ( see Supplementary Materials ) , and comparison of the methylcytosines identified independently in each replicate revealed a high concordance of cytosine methylation status between replicates ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . For each cell type , the final DNA methylation map presented in this study represents the composite of the two biological replicates . The OCT4 gene exemplifies both cell - specific differential methylation and the presence of non - CG methylation ( Fig . 1b ) , and in addition displayed a ~ 50 - fold reduction in OCT4 transcript in IMR90 ( data not shown ) . The absence of mCHG and mCHH methylation in IMR90 coincided with significantly lower transcript abundance of the de novo DNA methyltransferases ( DNMTs ) DNMT3A and DNMT3B and the associated DNMT3L in IMR90 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , which is supported by a previous study of DNA methylation in ES cells and somatic cells 19 and by the determined target sequence specificity of these DNMTs 21 , 22 . Multiple reads covering each methylcytosine can be used as a readout of the fraction of the sequences within the sample that are methylated at that site 16 , here referred to as the methylation level of a specific cytosine . Similar to the Arabidopsis genome 15 , in the H1 genome we observed that 77 % of mCG sites were 80 – 100 % methylated , whereas 85 % of mCHG and mCHH sites were 10 – 40 % methylated ( Fig . 1c ) , indicating that at sites of non - CG methylation only a fraction of the surveyed genomes in the sample were methylated . Notably , 56 % of mCG sites in IMR90 were highly methylated ( 80 – 100 % , Fig . 1c ) , indicating that although the total number of mCG sites in H1 and IMR90 is similar , in general the IMR90 mCG sites were typically less frequently methylated . In support of this , considering all CG site sequencing events , 82 . 7 % and 67 . 7 % were methylated in H1 and IMR90 , respectively . A global - scale view of DNA methylation levels revealed that the density of DNA methylation showed large variations throughout each chromosome ( Fig . 1d ) . Sub - telomeric regions of the chromosomes frequently showed higher DNA methylation density ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , which was previously reported as important for control of telomere length and recombination 23 , 24 . The smoothed profile of DNA methylation density in 100 kb windows indicated that on the chromosomal level the density profile of mCG in H1 and IMR90 was similar . The density profiles of mCHG and mCHH revealed that non - CG methylation was present throughout the entire chromosome . These two non - CG methylation marks showed a moderate correlation and did not always occur together ( Pearson correlation 0 . 5 in 1 kb windows ; Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . Notably , changes in density of the non - CG methylation were distinct from that of mCG in a number of regions . Lister et al . Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 May 19 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Pervasive non - CG DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells To characterize the abundant non - CG methylation in the H1 genome , we compared the average density of methylation relative to the underlying density of all potential sites of methylation in each context ( henceforth referred to as the relative methylation density ) , throughout various genomic features ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . We observed a correlation in the density of mCG and the distance from the transcriptional start site ( TSS ) , with mCG density increasing in the 5’ UTR to a similar level in exons , introns and the 3’ UTR as to 2 kb upstream of the TSS ( Fig . 3a ) . We generally observed lower relative densities of methylation at CG islands and TSS , however a subset of these regions did not display this depletion ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) 13 , 14 , 25 . mCHG and mCHH methylation densities also decreased significantly toward the TSS and returned to the same level as 2 kb upstream at the end of the 5’ UTR , however within exons , introns and 3’ UTRs the non - CG methylation densities were twice as high . Intriguingly , the mCHH density was approximately 15 – 20 % higher in exons than within introns and the 3’ UTR . To identify links between gene activity and non - CG methylation level within the gene body we performed strand - specific RNA - Seq 15 and observed a positive correlation between gene expression and mCHG ( R = 0 . 60 ) or mCHH ( R = 0 . 58 ) density ( Fig . 3b ) , with highly expressed genes containing 3 - fold higher non - CG methylation density than non - expressed genes ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . However , no correlation was observed between CG methylation density and gene expression in the H1 cells ( Fig . 3b ) . We identified 447 and 226 genes that were proximal to genomic regions highly enriched for mCHG and mCHH , respectively , with 180 genes in common . An example of non - CG methylation enrichment in such a gene , Splicing Factor 1 , is shown in Fig . 3c . Analysis of gene ontology terms for each set revealed significant enrichment for genes involved in RNA processing , RNA splicing , and RNA metabolic processes ( P 2 × 10 − 11 , Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . Unexpectedly , we found a significant enrichment of non - CG methylation on the anti - sense strand of gene bodies , for both mCHG and mCHH enriched sets of genes ( P < 0 . 1 and P < 0 . 001 , respectively , Fig . 3d ) . The anti - sense strand serves as the template for RNA polymerization , and further investigation will be required to determine if there are functional repercussions of this non - CG methylation strand bias . We also observed that genes in H1 had significantly more RNA originating from introns than in IMR90 , relative to the total number of sequenced reads in each sample , and this discrepancy in intronic read abundance was significantly enhanced in the mCHG and mCHH enriched genes ( P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 3e ) . The higher abundance of intronic reads was associated with higher non - CG methylation within gene bodies , rather than differential non - CG methylation of exons versus introns . In the Arabidopsis genome , the methylation state of a cytosine in the CG and CHG contexts is highly correlated with the methylation of the cytosine on the opposite strand within the symmetrical site 15 , 16 . While we observed that 99 % of mCG sites from the human cell lines were methylated on both strands , surprisingly mCHG was highly asymmetrical , with 98 % of mCHG sites being methylated on only one strand . This raises an interesting question as to how these sites of DNA methylation are consistently methylated in a considerable fraction of the genomes without two hemi - methylated CHG sites as templates for faithful propagation of the methylation state ( Fig . 1c ) . It is not yet known whether continual , but indiscriminate , de novo methyltransferase activity preferentially methylates particular CHG sites after replication , or if a persistent targeting signal is present that drives CHG methylation . We analyzed the genome sequence proximal to sites of non - CG methylation to determine whether enrichment of particular local sequences were evident , as previously reported in the Arabidopsis DNA methylomes 15 , 16 . Whereas no local sequence enrichment was observed for mCG sites , a preference for the TA dinucleotide upstream of non - CG methylation was observed ( Fig . 3f and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Furthermore , the base following a non - CG methylcytosine Lister et al . Page 4 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 May 19 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t was most commonly an A , with a T also observed relatively frequently , a sequence preference observed in previous in vitro studies of the mammalian DNMT3 methyltransferases 21 , 22 . To determine whether there was any preference for the distance between adjacent sites of DNA methylation in the human genome , we analyzed the relative distance between methylcytosines in each context within 50 nucleotides in introns . We focused on introns because these are genomic regions enriched in non - CG methylation , but unlike exons , are not constrained by protein coding selective pressures ( Fig . 3g , h ) . Analyses for random genomic sequences and exons are presented in Supplementary Fig . 9 , together with mCG spacing patterns . For methylcytosines in all contexts , a periodicity of 8 – 10 bases was evident ( Fig . 3g , h and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) , but interestingly a strong tendency was observed for two pairs of 8 - base separated mCHG sites spaced with 13 bases between them . An 8 – 10 base periodicity was also evident for mCHH sites , corresponding to a single turn of the DNA helix , as previously observed in the Arabidopsis genome 16 , indicating that the molecular mechanisms governing de novo methylation at CHH sites may be common between the plant and animal kingdoms . A structural study of the mammalian de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A and its partner protein DNMT3L found that 2 copies of each form a heterotetramer that contains two active sites separated by the length of 8 – 10 nucleotides in a DNA helix 26 , 27 . The consistent 8 – 10 nucleotide spacing we observed in the human genome suggests that DNMT3A may be responsible for catalysing the methylation at non - CG sites . Notably , the mCHG and mCHH relative spacing patterns were distinct , suggesting that this sub - categorization of the non - CG methylation is appropriate , and that distinct pathways may be responsible for the deposition of mCHG and mCHH in the human genome . DNA methylation is depleted at DNA - protein interaction sites Numerous past studies have documented that DNA methylation can alter the ability of some DNA binding proteins to interact with their target sequences28 – 32 . In order to further investigate this relationship we used ChIP - Seq 33 to identify sites of protein - DNA interaction in H1 cells for a set of proteins important for gene expression in the pluripotent state , namely NANOG , SOX2 , KLF4 , and OCT4 , as well as proteins involved in the transcription initiation complex and in enhancers ( TAF1 and p300 , respectively ) ( Supplementary Tables 3 – 8 ) . In general we observed a decrease in the profile of relative methylation density toward the site of interaction , particularly in the non - CG context , independently from proximity to the TSS ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . The IMR90 genome showed higher average density of methylation at H1 SOX2 and p300 interaction sites , but had similar CG methylation densities for the H1 NANOG and OCT4 interaction sites , even though the genes encoding these proteins are transcribed at a very low level in IMR90 relative to H1 ( 47 – 50 fold less mRNA ) , and are not considered to be functional in fibroblasts . This suggests that these genomic regions are generally maintained in a less methylated state in multiple cell types regardless of the occupancy of these specific DNA binding proteins . We next analyzed the patterns of DNA methylation in sets of enhancers either unique to each cell type or shared . ChIP - Seq was utilized to detect the location of enhancers throughout the H1 and IMR90 genomes , defined as regions of simultaneous enrichment of the histone modifications H3K4me1 and H3K27ac 34 ( Fig . 4b ) . We examined the average relative DNA methylation density at enhancer sites , as well as the flanking genomic regions , and found a depletion of CG methylation at IMR90 - specific enhancers , yet enrichment in mCG density in H1 at the same genomic locations ( Fig . 4b ) . In contrast , at H1 - specific enhancers there was no change in mCG density in either the H1 or IMR90 genome , but non - CG methylation density decreased approximately 3 - fold at the enhancer sites , relative to the density 5 kb up - and downstream . This is in agreement with the depletion of non - CG methylation in the H1 genome at predicted sites of p300 interaction ( Fig . 4a ) , a strong indicator of enhancer activity34 . The Lister et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t set of enhancer sites present in both H1 and IMR90 cells showed both of these cell - specific patterns : lower mCG density in IMR90 and lower non - CG methylation density in H1 . The specific depletion of DNA methylation at active enhancers in each cell type ( also recently reported on a limited basis35 ) indicates maintenance of these elements in an unmethylated state , potentially preventing interference in the process of protein - DNA interaction at these sites . Notably , H1 cells had depleted non - CG methylation but not mCG , in contrast to the mCG depletion at IMR90 enhancers . These data could indicate cell - type specific utilization of different categories of DNA methylation , possibly coupled with novel stem - cell specific factors that are able to recognize non - CG methylation , akin to the specific binding of the H3K9 histone methyltransferase KRYPTONITE to non - CG methylation sites in Arabidopsis 36 . Widespread cell - specific patterns of DNA methylation The paradigm of DNA methylation controlling aspects of cellular differentiation necessitates that patterns of methylation vary in different cell types . Numerous studies have previously documented differences in DNA methylation between cell types and disease states 7 , 8 , 10 , 37 . With comprehensive maps of DNA methylation throughout the genomes of the two distinct cell types , we next characterized changes in DNA methylation evident between the H1 and IMR90 DNA methylomes , and explored how these changes may relate to the distinctiveness of these cells . Pairwise comparison of methylation at the same genomic coordinates between H1 and IMR90 is required to reveal cell - specific methylation patterns potentially masked by average profiles . The Pearson correlation coefficient of the mCG methylation state between H1 and IMR90 was calculated for 20 equally sized windows flanking or within various genomic features ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Fig 11 ) , providing a measure of methylation state conservation at these genomic features between the two cell types , and distinct from the average methylation density profiles presented above ( Fig . 4 ) . At the sites of protein - DNA interaction surveyed in Fig . 4a , we observed a decrease in the correlation of methylation compared to the flanking 1 . 5 kb of the genome ( Fig . 5a ) , except for KLF4 ( data not shown ) . This decrease was most pronounced at the predicted site of protein - DNA interaction , indicating that even though the mCG depletion was a general feature of the surveyed protein binding sites ( Fig . 4a ) , when a pairwise comparison of the methylation status at each cytosine associated with the protein binding site between H1 and IMR90 was performed a significant decrease in the conservation of methylation was observed ( Fig . 5a ) . Surprisingly , we found that a large proportion of the IMR90 genome displayed lower levels of CG methylation than H1 ( Fig . 1c ) . Contiguous regions with an average methylation level less than 70 % were identified ( mean length = 153 kb ) , which we termed partially methylated domains ( PMDs ) ( Fig . 5b , Supplementary Fig . 12 and Supplementary Table 9 ) . The PMDs comprised a large proportion of every autosome ( average = 38 . 4 % ) , and 80 % of the IMR90 × chromosome ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , consistent with the lower levels of DNA methylation reported in the inactive × chromosome 38 . As IMR90 cells are derived from a female ( XX ) , it is anticipated that simultaneous sequencing of BS - converted genomic DNA from both the inactive and the active × chromosomes will manifest as PMDs throughout the majority of the × chromosome . However , the widespread prevalence of PMDs on the autosomes was unexpected . We analyzed the ratio of methylated to unmethylated CG sites within individual MethylC - Seq reads . The IMR90 reads located within PMDs were more frequently partially - or un - methylated compared to all IMR90 reads aligned to the autosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 12b ) . The decrease in PMD methylation manifested similarly in IMR90 autosomes and chromosome × , however currently we cannot determine whether common pathways are responsible for altering methylation patterns in all chromosomes .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Upon inspection of 5 , 644 genes with a TSS located in or within 10 kb of a PMD , we found a strong enrichment for these genes to be less expressed in IMR90 ( P = 2 × 10 − 47 , Fisher’s Exact Test , FET ) . Specifically , of all of the genes that were more highly expressed in H1 ( H1 ≥ 3 × IMR90 transcript abundance ) , 42 % were located within PMDs , compared to only 13 % of all more highly expressed genes in IMR90 cells being located in PMDs ( Fig . 5b , c , Supplementary Tables 10 , 11 ) . Many of the partially methylated and down - regulated genes in IMR90 displayed lower proximal H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 modifications , and higher proximal H3K27me3 levels ( Fig . 5b , Supplementary Fig . 13 , and Hawkins et al . , submitted ) . While in IMR90 cells we observed a positive correlation between the mean gene body mCG methylation level and gene expression , no such relationship was discernible in H1 cells ( Fig . 5d ) . Consequently , the positive correlation between gene expression and gene body methylation recently reported 12 could be re - interpreted as a depletion of methylation in repressed genes in differentiated cells . Epigenetic and transcriptional changes associated with stem cell hypomethylation A sliding window approach was used to identify differentially methylated regions ( DMRs ) enriched for cytosines where IMR90 was more highly methylated than H1 ( 5 % FDR , FET , Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . We identified 491 DMRs , and in a window spanning 20 kb up - and down - stream of each DMR we surveyed mCG density , mRNAs , smRNAs , H3K4me3 , H3K36me3 , H3K27me3 , genes , and repetitive elements ( Fig . 6 , Supplementary Table 12 , and Hawkins et al . , submitted ) . The DMRs were associated with 139 and 113 genes more highly expressed in H1 and IMR90 , respectively . More than half of these genes were associated with DMRs located within 2 kb upstream of the TSS or the 5’ UTR , which include factors previously defined as playing a role in embryonic stem cell function 39 ( Supplementary Fig . 15 and Supplementary Tables 13 , 14 ) . Complete linkage hierarchical clustering of these data revealed two broad categories of transcriptional activity , histone modifications and DNA methylation proximal to the DMRs ( Fig . 6 ) . Group 1 DMRs are associated with high proximal H3K4me3 , H3K36me3 , and transcriptional activity relative to IMR90 , and are unmarked by H3K27me3 in both cell types . Although we did not observe widespread association of small RNA molecules with enrichment of DNA methylation , we found that a subset of Group 1 DMRs co - localize with dense clusters of small RNAs that map to annotated Human Endogenous Retroviruses ( HERVs ) 40 . Notably , the HERVs were less densely methylated in H1 and frequently associated with high downstream transcriptional activity , in contrast to the more methylated state in IMR90 that was not associated with abundant small RNAs and showed little proximal transcription ( Fig . 6 and Supplementary Fig . 16 ) . Accurate targeting of DNA methylation by small RNAs is a well - established process in plants 41 . While our data did not provide evidence for the existence of an analogous process in the human cells , further experiments may be required to investigate this relationship in greater detail , such as DNA methylation profiling following silencing of components of the RNAi machinery . Group 2 DMRs were associated with gene - rich sequences that were more highly expressed in IMR90 cells and generally displaed a depletion of LINEs in the flanking sequence , with concomitant H3K27me3 modification and less DNA methylation , as observed in many IMR90 PMDs . Furthermore , Group 2 regions in H1 frequently displayed both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications , characteristic of the bivalent state that is thought to instil a suppressed but poised transcriptional status 42 , 43 . Many of these regions showed markedly less H3K27me3 in IMR90 in addition to more DNA methylation , suggesting that prior repression may have been relieved , and defining a set of genes potentially regulated by DNA methylation and involved in the developmental transition from a pluripotent to differentiated state .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Concluding Remarks We found extensive differences between the DNA methylomes of two human cell types , revealing the highly dynamic nature of this epigenetic modification . The genomic context of the DNA methylation is resolved , here revealing abundant methylation in the non - CG context , which is typically overlooked in alternative methodologies . Profiling of enhancers and different patterning of CG and non - CG methylation in gene bodies and their different correlation with gene expression suggest possible alternative roles for DNA methylation in these two contexts . The exclusivity of non - CG methylation in stem cells , likely maintained by continual de novo methyltransferase activity and not observed in differentiated cells , suggests that it may play a key role in the origin and maintenance of this pluripotent state . Essential future studies will need to explore the prevalence of non - CG methylation in diverse cell types , including variation throughout differentiation and its potential reestablishment in induced pluripotent states . Methods Summary Biological materials and sequencing libraries Human H1 , H9 , BMP4 - induced H1 , and IMR90 cells were cultured as described previously34 , 44 , 45 . smRNA - seq libraries were generated from 10 – 50 nt small RNAs using the Small RNA Sample Prep v1 . 5 kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) , as per manufacturer’s instructions . Strand - specific mRNA - seq libraries were produced using a modification of a protocol described previously 15 . Unique 5’ and 3’ RNA oligonucleotides were sequentially ligated to the ends of fragments of RNA isolated by depletion of rRNA from total RNA samples . MethylC - seq libraries were generated by ligation of methylated sequencing adapters to fragmented genomic DNA followed by gel purification , sodium bisulfite conversion and 4 cycles of PCR amplification . ChIP - Seq libraries were prepared following Illumina protocols with minor modifications ( See Supplementary Materials ) . Sequencing was performed using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II as per the manufacturer’s instructions . Read processing and alignment MethylC - seq sequencing data was processed using the Illumina analysis pipeline and FastQ format reads were aligned to the human reference genome ( hg18 ) using the Bowtie alignment algorithm 46 . The base calls per reference position on each strand were used to identify methylated cytosines at 1 % FDR . mRNA - seq reads were aligned to the human reference and splice junctions of UCSC Known Genes using the ELAND algorithm ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) . smRNA - seq reads that contained a subset of the 3’ adapter sequence were selected and this adapter sequence removed , retaining trimmed reads that were from 16 to 37 nt in length . These processed reads were aligned to the human reference genome ( NCBI build 36 / HG18 ) using the Bowtie alignment algorithm , and any read that aligned with no mismatches and to no more than 1000 locations in the reference genome was retained . Base calling , and mapping of Chip - Seq reads was performed using the Illumina pipeline . Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material .
