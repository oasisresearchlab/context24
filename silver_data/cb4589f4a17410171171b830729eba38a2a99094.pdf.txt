Simon , California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , CA , June 2 , 2010 ( received for review January 27 , 2010 ) The mammalian neocortex mediates complex cognitive behaviors , such as sensory perception , decision making , and language . The evolutionary history of the cortex , and the cells and circuitry underlying similar capabilities in nonmammals , are poorly under - stood , however . Twodistinct featuresof themammalianneocortex are lamination and radially arrayed columns that form functional modules , characterized by de ﬁ ned neuronal types and unique intrinsic connections . The seeming inability to identify these char - acteristic features in nonmammalian forebrains with earlier meth - ods has often led to the assumption of uniqueness of neocortical cells and circuits in mammals . Using contemporary methods , we demonstrate the existence of comparable columnar functional modules in laminated auditory telencephalon of an avian species ( Gallus gallus ) . A highly sensitive tracer was placed into individual layers of the telencephalon within the cortical region that is similar tomammalianauditorycortex . Distribution ofanterogradeand ret - rogradetransportablemarkersrevealedextensiveinterconnections across layers and between neurons within narrow radial columns perpendicular to the laminae . This columnar organization was fur - ther con ﬁ rmed by visualization of radially oriented axonal collater - als of individual intracellularly ﬁ lled neurons . Common cell types in birds and mammals that provide the cellular substrate of columnar functional modules were identi ﬁ ed . These ﬁ ndings indicate that laminar and columnar properties of the neocortex are not unique to mammals and may have evolved from cells and circuits found in more ancient vertebrates . Speci ﬁ c functional pathways in the brain can be analyzed in regard to their common phylogenetic origins , whichintroducesapreviouslyunderutilizedlevelofanalysistocom - ponents involved in higher cognitive functions . neocortex evolution | columnar organization | primary auditory cortex | intrinsic circuitry | granule cell T he origins and evolution of the forebrain and the mammalian neocortex , * where complex cognitive functions are centered , have long been of broad interest to scientists and nonscientists alike . For more than 100 y , the neocortex was considered an independently evolved structure unique to mammals . The non - mammalian telencephalon was frequently compared with the mammalian basal ganglia , which was thought to be involved in stereotypical instinctive behaviors ( 1 ) . A revolutionary revision in our concept of the nature of vertebrate brain organization was recently accepted in the revised nomenclature of the avian brain ( 2 , 3 ) . The avian Wulst and dorsal ventricular ridge , two prom - inent components of the telencephalon , are recognized as being homologous to pallial components of mammalian brains , which is consistent with the idea that avian telencephalon includes a large cortical component ( Fig . 1 A – C ) ( 4 – 6 ) . However , this postulated homology addresses only the most general aspects of the evolutionary relationship of the avian brain to the mam - mal brain , that is , in indicating that birds have some form of generic cortex . Whether or not discrete cell groups in the avian pallial telencephalon are homologous to the neocortex or non - cortical ( claustrum and amygdala ) mammalian pallium remains controversial . The proposal that the avian dorsal ventricular ridge contains populations of neurons and circuits homologous to those of the mammalian neocortex was initially suggested in the 1960s on the basis of similarities in neurotransmitter distribution and patterns of afferent connectivity ( 7 – 10 ) . Major sensory ascending pro - jections through the thalamus and then on the telencephalon of birds and reptiles demonstrated the antiquity of these pathways in amniotes and led to the hypothesis that distinct nuclei of the avian and reptilian telencephalon were homologous to mor - phologically and physiologically corresponding laminae of the mammalian neocortex . This nucleus to lamina homology is fur - ther supported by remarkable similarities in cell morphology , intratelencephalic connections , gene expression , and functions between speci ﬁ c nuclei in birds and corresponding laminae in mammals ( 4 – 6 , 11 – 16 ) . A more critical question , however , is whether these nuclei and their neurons are interconnected in a similar pattern to form cir - cuitry with similar intrinsic operational mechanism as those of the mammalian neocortex . Two of the most distinct features of the mammalian neocortex are its laminar architecture and columnar organization , features that underlie the essential computational mechanisms vital to their postulated functions ( 17 – 24 ) . The mam - malian neocortex is characterized by the presence of de ﬁ ned cell types arranged in six parallel laminae with distinctive neuronal connections organized in radial columns . Among these , layer IV receives a topographically organized input from the thalamus and redistributes the information to other layers through radially arrayed intrinsic connections between layers . Consequently , neu - rons included in a cylinder oriented perpendicularly to layers tend to have some speci ﬁ c functional properties in common and are believed to constitute local computational units ( 19 , 22 ) , although how this columnar organization contributes to cortical function is not completely understood ( 25 , 26 ) . In contrast , the cortical region of birds , as well as that of rep - tiles , lacks the obvious laminar appearance of uniformly parallel layers and has long been considered to be organized in a cluster pattern , that is , individual nuclei of the avian telencephalon having unitary functions . A lack of pertinent information that might address this question signi ﬁ cantly weakens the argument that the avian cortex is organized in a manner similar to the mam - malian neocortex , and has been used to justify an alternative view postulating homology to noncortical structures of the mammalian pallium ( 27 – 31 ) . These proposals argue that the reported simi - larities between the nonmammalian pallium and the mammalian neocortex could be independently evolved in the absence of data in support of conservation of microcircuitry in the course of evolution and / or common developmental origins .

The mammalian telencephalon contains cerebral cortex ( traditionally and simplistically considered to consist of two major divi - sions , the neocortex and allocortex ) , claustrum , amygdala , and basal ganglia . The ﬁ rst three components are derived from the pallial sector of the developing telencephalon , whereas the basal ganglion is developed from the subpallial sector . In nonmammalian species , the pallial portion of the telencephalon is also divided into hyperpallium , mes - opallium , and nidopallium based on location . 12676 – 12681 | PNAS | July 13 , 2010 | vol . 107 | no . 28 www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1006645107 In the present work , we provide evidence of a pattern of radial and columnar cellular circuitry within the auditory zone of the avian telencephalon , comparable to that found in the primary auditory cortex ( A1 ) of mammals . The A1 in mammals is the ﬁ rst - order recipient of the ascending projections from the auditory thalamus , the ventral division of the medial geniculate nucleus ( MGv ) ( 32 – 35 ) . The A1 is tonotopically organized , and neurons of one radial columnar module tend to respond to the same acoustic frequencies ( 20 , 36 , 37 ) . In birds , the caudal mesopallium ( CM ) and three subnuclei of Field L ( L1 , L2a , and L3 ) are horizontally elongated cell groups with their long axes in the same orientation . Field L2areceives direct input from thethalamic nucleus ovoidalis ( Ov ) , the avian homolog of the mammalian MGv , and then con - nects to CM , L1 , and L3 ( 8 , 38 , 39 ) . Functional magnetic reso - nance imaging has revealed that the avian Field L responds to a similar series of listening tasks as the human and other mam - malian auditory cortices ( 15 , 16 ) . Using 2 - deoxyglucose as an ac - tivity measure , Scheich and colleagues demonstrated a functional columnar organization that spans Fields L1 , L2a , L3 , and CM in response to sharply tuned auditory stimuli ( 40 – 42 ) . However , whether this columnar pattern is a simple re ﬂ ection of the tono - topic organization of thalamic inputs or a consequence of a similar internal organization of the avian Field L / CM complex as for the mammalian A1 remains unknown . Using precise placements of a highly sensitive tracer into in - dividual components of the chick Field L / CM complex , we exam - ined the organization of the microcircuitry and cell morphology . We found that the avian Field L / CM complex displays a similar internal organization with comparable cell types and circuitries as those found in the mammalian A1 . This similarity strongly argues for the homology of the two structures and might imply a conserved evolutionary origin of the mammalian neocortex from the non - mammalian pallium . Results Laminar Organization of the Field L / CM Complex . In birds , the au - ditory telencephalon consists of Field L in the caudal nidopal - lium , the CM , the dorsal nidopallium ( Nd ) , and the ventromedial portion of the intermediate arcopallium ( Aivm ; Fig . 1 C ) . Among these , the CM and three subdivisions of Field L ( L1 , L2a , and L3 ) are arranged in a series of laminae oriented approximately mediolaterally and separated by the mesopallial lamina ( LaM ; Fig . 1 D ) . Both the CM and L1 are heterogeneous in cell density and alignment , and each can be further divided into external and internal sublayers . The CM externus is composed of loosely packed neurons oriented parallel to the surface of the ventricle . In contrast , the CM internus contains a high density of neurons without obvious alignment . The two sublayers of L1 resemble each other in general cytoarchitecture and are more dif ﬁ cult to differentiate in Nissl - stained sections . Neuron size in the CM and L1 are comparable , ranging from 70 to 170 μ m 2 in area . The majority of the neurons in L2a are small ( 50 – 80 μ m 2 in area ) . These cells are the smallest neurons in all of the layers and give L2a a granular appearance in Nissl - stained sections . These granule cells tend to align in vertical stacks perpendicular to the layers ( Fig . S1 ) . Neurons in L3 vary widely in size ( 50 – 250 μ m 2 in area ) and are distributed in a random pattern . The Field L / CM complex displays a strong immunocytochem - ical staining for parvalbumin ( Fig . 1 E ) , similar to the mammalian A1 ( 43 , 44 ) . Individual layers of the chick CM and Field L , par - ticularly the sublayers of the CM and L1 , are readily apparent in sections stained with parvalbumin immunoreactivity . The CM Fig . 1 .

Both sublayers of L1 contain labeled somata , with a notably higher density in the external division than in the internal division ( Fig . 1 G ) . Immunoreactivity in L2a and L3 was found in both somata and neuropils . Columnar Organization of the Field L / CM Complex . To explore whether functional units in the Field L / CM complex are in - dividual layers or vertical modules across all layers , using slice preparations of chick brains , we placed a highly sensitive tracer , biotinylated dextran amine ( BDA ) , precisely into individual layers of the Field L and CM and mapped anterograde and retrograde transport of BDA within the complex . The resultan - tinjections were small ( most commonly 80 – 200 μ m in diameter ) . Regardless of the layers of deposition of the tracer , transport of BDA always formed a column that crossed all layers and was oriented perpendicular to the layers ( Fig . 2 and Fig . S2 ) . The column contained a central region across all layers with a rela - tively high density of labeled ﬁ bers and neurons and , in some cases , adjacent areas with scattered labeling of ﬁ bers and neu - rons . The width of the central region of the column varied from 300 to 500 μ m . With few exceptions , retrogradely and ante - rogradely labeled neurons were located within or immediately adjacent to this central region . Individual or bundles of thick axons coursed within the column along its long axis , although sparse axons coursing obliquely away from the column were detected as well ( arrows in Fig . 2 A ) . We also evaluated the lateral spread of the BDA transport by quantifying the size and shape of the region encompassing all la - beled cell bodies ( Table S1 ) . The long axis of the region was ori - ented perpendicular to the layers and averaged 1 , 284 ± 322 μ m ( mean ± SD , n = 21 ; range , 492 – 1 , 868 μ m ) . The average length of theshortaxiswas526 ± 194 μ m ( range , 193 – 894 μ m ) . Theshortaxes were 21 – 56 % as long as the long axes ( mean ± SD , 41 ± 10 % ) . Our data also demonstrate a remarkably similar main infor - mation stream within columnar modules in birds and mammals . In mammals , the information stream in A1 starts in layer IV , which receives tonotopic thalamic inputs from the MGv and then conveys information to more super ﬁ cial layers , which in turn project to deeper layers ( 45 ) . In birds , Field L2a is the principal recipient of thalamic input from Ov , the homolog of the mam - malian MGv . After BDA injection into L2a , a prominent bundle of axons emerged from the injection site and coursed super ﬁ - cially through L1 and CM ( Fig . 2 B ) . Terminal - like processes were found in both the CM internus and L1 , indicating a pro - jection from L2a onto these super ﬁ cial layers . This observation was con ﬁ rmed by the presence of labeled neurons in L2a after BDA injections into L1 and / or the CM ( Fig . 2 C , Fig . S2 A and B , and Table S1 ) . After receiving inputs from L2a , the CM sends recurrent pro - jections back to L1 and L2a , and many of these axons appear to continue into L3 . Injections into the CM anterogradely labeled long descending axons that extended through all three layers of Field L ( Fig . 2 A , C , and D ) . Some axons could be traced laterally beyond L3 . Consistently , injections into these deeper layers ( L1 , L2a , and L3 ) retrogradely labeled neurons in the CM ( Fig . 2 B , Fig . S2 B and D , and Table S1 ) . In contrast , L1 might not provide signi ﬁ cant input to deeper layers . After BDA injections into L2a and / or L3 , labeled neurons were consistently scarce in L1 ( Fig . 2 B , Fig . S2 D , and Table S1 ) ; however , injections into either the CM or L1 demonstrated reciprocal connections between these two layers ( Fig . 2 C and Fig . S2 B ) . A number of neurons in L3 may sent their axons or extend their dendrites to more super ﬁ cial layers , as suggested by the presence of a low density of labeled neurons in L3 after BDA injections into the CM , L1 , or L2a . These radially oriented intrinsic connections within the Field L / CM complex were further con ﬁ rmed at the individual cell level by visualizing the axonal morphology of the neurons ﬁ lled in - tracellularly . Fig . 2 E and F shows two examples of this . The neuron illustrated in Fig . 2 E , a nongranulous spiny neuron located in L2a , displayed a multipolar soma ( 255 μ m 2 in area ) and a 140 μ m × 170 μ m dendritic ﬁ eld . The main axon issued a number of axonal collaterals that mostly extended super ﬁ cially toward the surface of the ventricle and arborized within L1 and the CM . One of these collateral extended deeply and formed a small arbori - zation in L3 . Three additional collaterals traveled within L2a without obvious arborization . We were not able to sample small Fig . 2 . Columnar organization of the Field L / CM complex in chicks .

Fig . 2 F shows a spiny stellate neuron ( 165 μ m 2 in area ) in the CM with a 180 - μ m × 200 - μ m dendritic ﬁ eld . The main axon issued collaterals coursing in all directions . Most collaterals were either short or did not exhibit obvious arborization before extending beyond the slices . The only exception was a long descending axon collateral that arborized prominently in L2a and L3 . Major Cell Types Responsible for Intrinsic Connections . Therestricted distribution of labeled neurons in a column indicates that most , if not all , cell classes of the Field L / CM complex participate in the columnar organization . We reconstructed the somatodendritic morphology of several major cell types of labeled neurons after BDA injections . Notably , a major type of labeled neurons in L2a has a unique somatodendritic morphology ( Fig . 3 ) , identical in appearance to the small stellate granule cells in the mammalian layer IV described by Ramón y Cajal ( 46 ; ﬁ g . 385 ) . The soma of these neurons in the chick L2a were tiny ( mean , 76 . 3 ± 18 . 6 μ m 2 in area ; n = 68 ) , with short and long axes of 7 . 7 ± 1 . 0 μ m and 9 . 8 ± 1 . 5 μ m , respectively . Between three and four extremely ﬁ ne dendrites issued from the soma in all directions and formed a very restricted dendritic ﬁ eld , < 100 μ m in diameter . Some neurons displayed dendritic spines , and others appeared to have relatively smooth dendrites . Whereas most Golgi studies in mammals failed to identify this cell type , two studies ( 46 , 47 ) successfully described the morphology of the granular cells in layer IV of the mammalian sensory cortex , which is very comparable to the granule cells identi ﬁ ed in chicks . Sanides and Sanides ( 47 ) further noted that small stellate cells , which they called “ short radiator ” stellate cells , are the major cell types in layer IV in animals with a highly dif - ferentiated neocortex ( also see ref . 49 ) . These small stellate cells appear to be highly resistant to Golgi impregnation in humans ( 46 ) , cats ( 48 ) , and birds ( 11 ) , and are dif ﬁ cult to sample with in - tracellular sharp electrodes . A low density of large spiny and nonspiny multipolar and bipo - lar neurons was also labeled in L2a ( Fig . 3 A ) . These neurons ’ conspicuous thick dendrites and large dendritic ﬁ elds distinguished them fromthegranule cells ( Fig . S3 ) . The somatarangedinaverage diameter from 10 to 18 μ m . In contrast , these large neurons pre - sent the major cell types labeled in CM , L1 , and L3 ( Fig . S3 ) . The dendritic patterns of these neurons varied among stellate , bipolar , and horizontal orientations . Occasionally , small stellate neurons were found in L3 , morphologically similar to the granular cells in L2a . Pyramidal cells with long apical dendrites spanning several layers were not detected in the avian Field L / CM complex . Discussion This study reveals remarkable similarities in the internal archi - tecture of the microcircuitry of the avian auditory cortex and the primary auditory neocortex ( A1 ) in mammals ( Fig . 4 ) . As in mammals , the avian Field L / CM complex , a prominent compo - nent of the auditory telencephalon , is composed of a number of layers in which auditory neurons interact via radially arrayed intrinsic connections . Our results allow us to compare several layers of the mam - malian A1 with speci ﬁ c cell groups in the avian auditory telen - cephalon . Speci ﬁ cally , the avian Field L2a corresponds to layer IV of the mammalian A1 . Both structures contain densely packed small stellate neurons , also called granule cells . Their somata are separated by ﬁ bers into columns or clusters and electronically coupled in both squirrel monkey ( 50 ) and starling ( 11 , 51 ) . In both birds and mammals , dendrites of the granule cells are poorly developed in terms of thickness , length , and dendritic processes ( 46 ) . Both the avian L2a and the mammalian layer IV are the direct targets of the primary ascending pathway from the auditory thala - mus . Histochemically , the avian L2a contains a high density of parvalbumin immunoreactive neuropils , consistent with the staining pattern seen in layer IV of the mammalian A1 . In addition , speci ﬁ c genes , such as eag / kch5 , expressed within layer IV in mammals are similarly speci ﬁ cally expressed in the avian Field L2a . † These conserved similarities suggest that the avian CM and L1 may represent a homolog of the super ﬁ cial cortical layers in mammals , because they receive inputs from radially oriented axons Fig . 3 .

Of note , this general pattern in chicks is consistent with previous studies in two other avian species ( 38 , 39 ) ; see SI Discussion for more information . In particular , L1 ( especially its external division ) can be speci ﬁ cally compared with the mammalian layer III , because both provide major output from the super ﬁ cial layers . In chicks , L1 , but not the CM , contains neurons that project on the dorsal Nd ( 38 ) . In addition , the L1 externus appears to be the major source of origin within the Field L / CM complex that innervates the ventromedial portion of the intermediate Aivm ( Fig . S4 ) . In mammalian A1 , layer III sends axons to deeper layers within the column and , along with layers V and VI , provides exclusive laminar origin to the commissural con - nection between two A1s ( 45 , 52 ) . Radially oriented intrinsic connections suggest that the func - tional unit of the avian Field L / CM complex is composed not of individual nuclei , but rather of columnar modules with inter - connections across laminated layers . This suggestion was ﬁ rst advanced by Scheich and colleagues on the basis of their 2 - deoxyglucose and physiological studies showing that units with the same or a similar best frequency are located in 2D neuronal planes perpendicularly across Field L and the CM ( 40 – 42 ) . These results are directly comparable to observations in the mammalian A1 , where all of the neurons within one columnar module tend to respond to the same or similar frequencies . Not alllayers of the mammalian A1 are equally represented in the FieldL / CMcomplex . Forexample , adescendingprojectionfromthe mammalian layers V and VI on the midbrain and thalamus is absent in the avian Field L and CM , but arises from the Aivm ( 38 ) . The AivmreceivesmassivemonosynapticinputfromtheL1externusandpolysynapticinputfromL1andL3viatheNd ( 38 ) , suggesting that the Nd and Aivm , along with L3 , are critical components of the avian , equivalent to mammalian layers V and VI . Thus is supported by the ﬁ nding that the Aivm shares some biochemical signatures with mammalian cortical layer V . ‡ In addition , the Aivm projects bilaterallyon the Field L / CM complex ( 38 ) . This bilateral projection can be compared with the recurrent intrinsic projection within the column from layers V and VI on the super ﬁ cial layers and the re - entrant projection from the contralateral layers V and VI on the super ﬁ cial layers of the mammalian AI ( 45 , 52 ) . This identical internal organization and intertelencephic con - nections of the avian Field L / CM complex and the mammalian A1 are consistent with these structures ’ equivalent functions in listening tasks ( 15 , 16 ) . This consistency strongly suggests the ho - mology of thetwo structuresand emphasizesthe need to reevaluate our concepts of the uniqueness of cortical networks in mammals and their evolutionary origins . Other mammalian structures that have been suggested to be homologous to the avian Field L / CM complex do not exhibit similar internal organization , thalamic in - put , and function ( SI Discussion ) . It is noteworthy that birds rep - resent not a stage in the evolutionary history of mammals , but rather a parallel branch to mammals on the evolutionary tree . Notable differences in cytoarchitecture and organization between the avian auditory cortex and mammalian AI neocortex have been identi ﬁ ed ; for example , the avian Nd and Aivm do not exhibit laminar and columnar organization identi ﬁ ed in the Field L / CM complex , even though they are comparable to mammalian layers V and VI in terms of connections and neurochemistry . In addition , we did not detect pyramidal cells with long apical dendrites spanning several layers in the avian Field L / CM . Mammalian pyramidal cells might have evolved from nonpyramidal neurons in stem rep - tiles ( 11 ) , and long apical dendrites may be a mammal - speci ﬁ c representation . In addition , our ﬁ ndings suggest that speci ﬁ c functional path - ways in the brain can be analyzed in regard to their common phylogenetic origins . Although this is recognized to be the case for brain structures such as the spinal cord , brainstem , and olfactory bulb ( 46 ) , it introduces a previously underutilized level of analysis to components involved in higher cognitive functions . The con - served evolution of the mammalian neocortex further supports the utility of birds as suitable animal model in studies of the or - ganization , development , and information processing of the sen - sory systems , in addition to their current use in studies of motor systems , such as vocal control systems .

In chicks , the boundaries between the medial and lateral CM are ambiguous . Although our injections were located mostly in the more medial portion of the CM , wechosetodescribethestudiedmesopalliumregionusingthe more general nomenclature “ caudal mesopallium ” for accuracy . The traditional de ﬁ nition of the Field L2 in birds contains two divisions , a medial portion ( L2a ) and a more laterally located portion ( L2b ) . The present study focuses on the similarities be - tween the avian L2a and the mammalian A1 , both of which are primary cortical targets of the tonotopically organized lemniscal auditory system . In contrast , neurons in L2b receive auditory inputs from separate ascending pathways and exhibit broad fre - quency tuning . The equivalent component of the avian L2b in mammals remains unknown . The organization and connection of L2b were not examined in the present study . It is noteworthy that the general pattern of intrinsic connections of the Field L / CM complex in chicks is consistent with that re - ported in previous studies in two other avian species . In zebra ﬁ nches , each subunit of the complex ( CM , L1 , L2a , L3 ) connects with another subunit through reciprocal connections ( 1 ) . We id - enti ﬁ ed the majority of these connections in chicks , but found no evidence of a substantial projection of L1 to other regions of the Field L . In chicks , L1 provides a major output layer of the complex , consistent with studies in pigeons ( 2 ) . The pattern of the intrinsic connectivity of the complex appears to be less com - plicated in pigeons than in zebra ﬁ nches and chicks , with only two projections identi ﬁ ed ( 2 ) . These discrepancies across studies might be due to interspecies variation and / or technical limita - tions . Given the complexity of the interconnections across layers , exploration of the intrinsic detailed organization of the complex must be conducted at the individual cell level . The remarkable similarities between the mammalian A1 neo - cortex and the avian auditory cortex , as described above , em - phasize the need to reevaluate our concepts of the uniqueness of cortical networks in mammals and their evolutionary origins . These ﬁ ndings further challenge the views that the avian Field L / CM complex is homologous to a part of the mammalian amyg - dala , endopiriform area , or claustrum instead of A1 ( 3 – 7 ) . This reasoning is based on selective data from gene expression and development , as well as a disputed direct thalamic input to the amygdala and claustrum , which has been interpreted as being homologous to the avian Ov - Field L pathway . However , the tha - lamic inputs to the claustrum and amygdala originate from the medial and dorsal divisions of the medial geniculate nucleus , the posterior intralaminar nucleus , and the suprageniculate nucleus ( 8 ) , which are components of the secondary or nonlemniscal au - ditory pathway characterized by polysensory inputs in addition to broad frequency tuning and lack of tonotopy ( 9 ) . In contrast , the avian Field L / CM and the mammalian A1 are the major telence - phalic targets of the lemniscal auditory pathway via the mammalian MGv and the avian Ov , which are characterized by sharp fre - quency tuning and tonotopic organization ( 9 ) . The distinctly dif - ferent sensory inputs of the mammalian amygdala / claustrum and the avian Field L / CM provide strong evidence against the proposed homology of these two structures . Another important difference between these two structures is that amygdala and claustrum do not display a columnar internal organization , although they do contain complex intrinsic connections among its subdivisions ( 10 , 11 ) . SI Materials and Methods All experimental procedures used in this study were approved by the University of California San Diego ’ s Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with International Commit - tee of Medical Journal Editors policy . Experiments were per - formed on White Leghorn chicks ( Gallus gallus ) of age < 5 d . In Vitro BDA Tracing and Intracellular Filling in Slice Preparations . The procedure has been described previously ( 12 ) . Forty - one chicks were anesthetized with a mixture of 40 mg / kg of ketamine and 12 mg / kg of xylazine , and then decapitated . Brain slices ( 300 μ m thick ) through the Field L / CM complex were prepared in a modi ﬁ ed coronal plane that may best conform to the radial plane or orientation ﬁ rst suggested by Bonke et al . ( 13 ) . Layers of the complex were readily identi ﬁ ed in wet tissue as four ap - proximately parallel bands of differing brightness . BDA was in - jected extracellularly into individual layers using a glass electrode ﬁ lled with 10 % BDA either by pressure ( 30 – 150 nL in volume ) or iontophoretically ( positive current of 2 – 10 μ A for 10 min ) . Intracellular ﬁ lling of individual neurons was conducted in dif - ferent slices with an electrode ( 100 – 300 M Ω ) ﬁ lled with 4 % bi - ocytin in 0 . 3 M KAc . Cell penetration was indicated by a sudden negative voltage drop and cell discharges . Biocytin was ion - tophoresed into the neuron with 2 – 3 nA of positive current for 3 min . Only one cell was ﬁ lled in a single slice . Localization of BDA and biocytin were subsequently visualized by the standard avidin - biotin - peroxidase method , and sections were counter - stained with Giemsa for identi ﬁ cation of layers . In total , 21 slices with identi ﬁ able lamination , a clean BDA injection site , and good transportation of the tracer were chosen from 65 injected slices for data analyses ; the injection sites are listed in Table S1 . Nine neurons were ﬁ lled intracellularly with their somata located in CM ( n = 3 ) , L1 ( n = 1 ) , L2 ( n = 4 ) , and L3 ( n = 1 ) . Parvalbumin Immunocytochemistry . The procedure has been de - scribed previously ( 12 ) . In brief , two chicks were transcardially perfused with 0 . 9 % saline followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde . After post ﬁ xation and sucrose equilibration of the brain , 30 - μ m coronal sections were acquired using a freezing sliding microtome . Free - ﬂ oating sections were incubated with primary antibody solution ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ; lot # 017H4821 ) overnight at 4 °C , fol - lowed by biotinylated anti - IgG antibody ( 1 : 200 ) for 1 h at room temperature . Localization of parvalbumin immunoreactivity was subsequently visualized by the standard avidin - biotin - peroxidase method . The localization pattern in the Field L / CM complex was consistent in the two chicks . Cell Reconstruction and Measurement . Tracing of labeled neuronal structures after BDA extracellular injections was done with a camera lucida on a Zeiss WL microscope from individual resectioned 80 - μ m - thick sections . Slices with injections of BDA - conjugated rhodamine were observed and reconstructed using an Olympus FV - 300 confocal microscope . For intracellularly ﬁ lled neurons , axons from three adjacent 80 - μ m - thick sections con - taining the soma were reconstructed to provide a more complete tracing of axonal collaterals . The cell reconstructions were per - formed before Giemsa counterstaining to avoid obscuring ﬁ ne cellular processes . All of the measurements , including soma size and dimensions of tracer transports , were done on calibrated images captured with a black and white ( B / W ) CCD camera , using Image software ( National Institutes of Health ) . No cor - rections were made for tissue shrinkage . Wang et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1006645107 1 of 4 1 .
