Location of key positively charged residues on the F - BAR domain and their interaction with the membrane in simulation WT1 . ( A ) F - BAR proteins are colored in blue and orange to distinguish the monomers . Colored red is cluster 1 , which includes residues Lys27 , Lys30 , Lys33 , Lys110 , Arg113 , Lys114 , Arg121 and Arg122 . Colored purple is cluster 2 , which includes residues Lys132 , Lys138 , Arg139 , Lys140 , Arg146 and Lys150 . Colored black are positively charged residues near the short loop of residues 56 to 60 , which include residues Lys51 , Lys52 and Arg 57 . Colored green are positively charged residues at the end of the helix , which include residues Lys171 and Lys173 . Residues Lys138 , Lys173 and Phe117 do not form contact with negatively charged lipids . ( B ) Number of contacts formed between negatively - charged DOPS lipid headgroups and positively charged residues along the inner surface of F - BAR domains . A contact is considered formed if nitrogen atoms of Arg / Lys residues are within 5 ˚A of an oxygen atom of a DOPS lipid headgroup . Contacts of representative residues with lipid are colored in purple , red and black , the colors corresponding to the clusters deﬁned in ( A ) . 3 Figure S2 .

( B ) Alignment of F - BAR domain family protein monomer colored according to structural conservation . Key positively charged residues are highlighted in green . 5 Figure S4 . Behavior of key residues in F - BAR domain simulation WT1 . ( A ) Location of the key residues on the F - BAR domain . F - BAR proteins are colored in blue and orange to distinguish the monomers . Colored red are the Pro210 residues of the two monomers ; the pro210 - pro210 distance reﬂects inter - monomer motion . Colored blue is residue Ala256 ; the Pro210 - Ala256 distance characterizes intra - monomer motion . Three internal salt bridges are formed by residues Glu15 and Arg113 , Asp23 and Arg27 , Glu12 and Arg121 colored purple , black and green , respectively . ( B ) Inter - monomer and intra - monomer movement of F - BAR domain dimer . Colored red is the distance between C α atom of Pro210 on two monomers , the distance characterizing inter - monomer motion . Colored blue is the distance between C α atom of Pro210 and of Ala256 , the distance characterizing intra - monomer motion . Original data are shown in gray and running averages over 10 ns in color . Interactions between F - BAR domain and membrane do not induce conformational change in the central helices . ( C ) Dynamics of three internal salt bridges characterized through the respective bond distances . Colored purple is the distance between CZ atoms of Arg27 and CG atom of Asp23 ; colored black is the distance between CZ atoms of Arg121 and CD atom of Glu12 ; colored green is the distance between CZ atoms of Arg113 and CD atom of Glu15 . Original data are shown in gray and running averages over 10 ns in color . Arginine residues 27 , 121 , 113 interact with neighboring residues and at the same time with membrane lipids . See also Fig . 1 and Fig . S1 . 6 Figure S5 . Change of curvature during simulation WT1DEL ( see Table 1 ) . Original data are shown in gray and running averages over 5 ns in red . Snapshots of the F - BAR domain - membrane system are shown at 0 , 40 and 85 ns . F - BAR proteins are colored in blue and orange to distinguish the monomers . Tails of membrane lipids are colored grey ; the neutral DOPC head groups are colored blue and the negatively charged DOPS head groups red . The membrane curvature does not change until 40 ns , and from then on the F - BAR domain turns towards one side , assuming ﬁnally a side laying state . 7 Figure S6 . Coiled - coil motion of F - BAR domain side helices during the ﬁrst 40 ns of simulation WT1 . The F - BAR domain at 0 ns is shown in grey and at 40 ns in color . Helices 2 , 3 and 4 at 40 ns are shown in blue , purple and green , respectively . Red arrows indicate the movement of helices 3 and 4 . Interactions between F - BAR domain and membrane induce partial uncoiling of the coiled - coil structure of the F - BAR domain . 8 Figure S7 . Secondary structure evolution of the F - BAR domain during simulation WT1 . Turn ( T ) , extended conformation ( E ) , isolated bridge ( B ) , alpha helix ( H ) , 3 - 10 helix ( G ) , pi - helix ( I ) and coil ( C ) structures are colored in green , yellow , brown , purple , blue , orange and white , respectively . The ﬁve helices of each F - BAR monomer are shown in order 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 in black , blue , purple , green and black , respectively . Interactions between F - BAR domain and membrane do not induce helical structure change . 9 Figure S8 . Change of angles α , θ during simulation WT1WAT ( see Table 1 ) . Original data are shown in gray and running averages over 2 ns in red . Snapshots of the F - BAR domain are shown at 0 and 20 ns for simulation WT1WAT . F - BAR proteins are colored in blue and orange to distinguish the monomers . Simulation WAT1WAT described the F - BAR domain dimer in water , without lipid membrane , the membrane having been removed from the ﬁnal conformation of simulation WT1 ( see Methods ) . Within 5 ns , both angle α and θ return to values similar to those seen in simulation NL1 and NL2 , and the curvature of the F - BAR domain as well as the tilting angles of the side helices are restored close to the native state values . 10 Figure S9 . Curvature distribution of simulated F - BAR domain . Protein curvature from the last 100 ns of simulation NL1 are shown as black dots . A Gaussian ﬁt to the distribution is shown in red ( average = 0 . 0029 1 / ˚A , halfwidth = 0 . 001 1 / ˚A ) . 11 Figure S10 . Bond and angle parameters of the SBCG simulation in comparison with those of the all - atom simulation . Bond and angle parameters obtained from Boltzmann inversion of the all - atom simulation are shown as a green line , those from the all - atom simulation as a blue line and those from automated iterative reﬁnement as a red line . 12 Figure S11 . Comparison of simulations 8 - F - BARs ( all - atom ) and SBCG 8 - F - BARs ( SBCG , see Table 1 ) . Conformation of 8 F - BAR domains on top of a lipid patch are shown at t = 0 and t = 175 ns . Individual F - BAR domains are diﬀerentiated by color ; tails of membrane lipids are colored grey ; the neutral DOPC head groups are colored blue and the negatively charged DOPS head groups red .
