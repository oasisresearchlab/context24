Although critical for maintaining physi - ological homeostasis , mechanisms controlling the formation of microvilli remain poorly understood . Here , we report that the inverse - bin - amphiphysin - Rvs ( I - BAR ) - domain - containing protein insulin re - ceptor tyrosine kinase substrate ( IRTKS ) ( also known as BAIAP2L1 ) promotes the growth of epithelial microvilli . Super - resolution microscopy and live im - aging of differentiating epithelial cells revealed that IRTKS localizes to the distal tips of actively growing microvilli via a mechanism that requires its N - termi - nal I - BAR domain . At microvillar tips , IRTKS pro - motes elongation through a mechanism involving its C - terminal actin - binding WH2 domain . IRTKS can also drive microvillar elongation using its SH3 domain to recruit the bundling protein EPS8 to microvillar tips . These results provide new insight on mechanisms that control microvillar growth dur - ing the differentiation of transporting epithelial cells and help explain why IRTKS is targeted by enteric pathogens that disrupt microvillar structure during infection of the intestinal epithelium . INTRODUCTION Transporting epithelial cells line the luminal surface of many hol - low organs , where they promote solute uptake from the external environment . Transport is aided by actin - supported membrane protrusions called microvilli , which increase apical membrane surface area [ 1 ] . A single microvillus contains a core bundle of parallel actin ﬁlaments with barbed ends oriented away from the cell and pointed ends embedded in an underlying terminal web [ 2 ] . Certain epithelial cell types , such as intestinal entero - cytes , build hundreds of densely packed microvilli in an array known as the ‘‘brush border’’ ( BB ) [ 3 , 4 ] . In addition to promoting nutrient absorption , intestinal microvilli provide a barrier against luminal pathogens and toxins [ 5 ] . Interestingly , a subset of path - ogenic microbes , including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ) , have evolved mechanisms to destroy microvilli , which leads to nutrient malabsorption and osmotic imbalances that can prove life threatening [ 6 ] . Despite the critical physiological role of the BB , the molecules and mechanisms controlling micro - villar growth remain poorly understood . Microvillar growth occurs during enterocyte differentiation , which takes place in pit - like ‘‘crypts , ’’ sites that harbor intestinal stem cells [ 7 ] . Although crypt epithelial cells exhibit short , disor - ganized microvilli [ 8 , 9 ] , the apical domain undergoes a striking transition as nascent enterocytes migrate out of crypts and onto the villus [ 8 , 10 ] . Deﬁning features of this transition include an increase in microvillar packing density ( number of microvilli / cell ) and length . Both of these changes increase apical mem - brane surface area and contribute to maximizing the absorptive capacity of mature enterocytes . Although mechanisms that drive tight microvillar packing are beginning to emerge [ 3 , 11 – 15 ] , molecules responsible for elongation of microvilli during differentiation remain poorly un - derstood . Previous studies implicated actin ﬁlament bundling proteins , including villin and espin , in elongation [ 16 , 17 ] . Bundling proteins also play a role in the growth , elongation , and maintenance of other actin - supported protrusions , including stereocilia ( espin - 1 , plastin - 1 , and fascin - 2 ) [ 18 – 20 ] and ﬁlopodia ( fascin - 1 ) [ 21 ] , respectively . Remarkably , studies on knockout ( KO ) mice lacking the three major microvillar actin bundlers ( villin , espin , and plastin ) revealed that BBs are still present [ 22 ] , sug - gesting the existence of alternate assembly pathways . Factors that target to the ends of core actin bundles would also be well positioned to exert control over bundle length . Indeed , cordon bleu targets near the pointed ends of microvillar actin cores and has been shown to promote their growth [ 23 – 25 ] . Given the high outward membrane curvature generated during protrusion , another group of molecules likely to play important roles in microvillar elongation are I - BAR ( inverse - bin - amphiphy - sin - Rvs ) proteins [ 26 , 27 ] . I - BAR domains are small membrane - binding , three - helix bundles that dimerize and exhibit a structural curvature that is well matched to outward bending [ 28 , 29 ] . Mem - bers of the I - BAR family ( including IRSp53 , IRTKS , BAIAP2L2 , MIM , and ABBA ) are comprised of an N - terminal BAR domain that interacts with acidic phospholipids , a central SH3 domain , and an actin - binding Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein homol - ogy 2 ( WH2 ) motif at the C terminus [ 26 , 27 ] . I - BAR proteins have been implicated in generating ﬁlopodia on the surface of motile cells [ 30 , 31 ] and dendritic spines in neurons [ 32 ] , physio - logical scenarios that both require membrane protrusion . A previous proteomic study by our laboratory identiﬁed insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate ( IRTKS ) ( or brain - speciﬁc 2876 Current Biology 28 , 2876 – 2888 , September 24 , 2018 ª 2018 Elsevier Ltd . angiogenesis inhibitor 1 - associated protein - like 1 [ BAIAP2L1 ] ) as the only I - BAR - domain - containing protein in the intestinal BB [ 33 ] . IRTKS was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a tyrosine phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate [ 34 ] and subsequently predicted to be an I - BAR domain protein [ 31 ] . Later work showed that overex - pression of IRTKS induced dramatic effects on the actin cyto - skeleton in a WH2 - domain - dependent manner [ 35 ] . Studies on IRTKS KO mouse models implicate this molecule in insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis [ 36 ] , as well as the formation of dorsal ﬁlopodia in embryonic ﬁbroblasts [ 37 ] . IRTKS is also hi - jacked by EHEC during its infection of the intestinal tract . Under these conditions , the IRTKS SH3 domain binds tightly to viru - lence factors that ultimately stimulate actin polymerization and adherent pedestal formation , which are required for survival of the microbe and continued infection [ 38 – 41 ] . The dependence of EHEC pathogenesis on IRTKS strongly implicates this mole - cule as a resident of the enterocyte apical domain , the initial site of EHEC contact with the epithelium , yet how IRTKS contrib - utes to normal BB function remains unknown . Here , we report that IRTKS plays an important role in elon - gating microvilli . Using super - resolution microscopy , we discov - ered that IRTKS exhibits striking localization to the distal tips of microvilli , where the growing ends of actin ﬁlaments are found . IRTKS targets to these sites of outward membrane curvature us - ing its N - terminal I - BAR domain . Once at the tips , IRTKS serves to elongate microvilli via distinct mechanisms that require func - tional WH2 and SH3 domains . A role for the SH3 domain in elon - gation is in part explained by binding to EPS8 , an established F - actin capping and bundling protein . We show that IRTKS con - trols the localization of EPS8 and promotes its targeting to micro - villar tips . Thus , IRTKS functions in microvillar elongation directly using its WH2 domain and indirectly using its SH3 domain to recruit EPS8 , which also harbors its own elongation activity . Together , these studies identify the ﬁrst I - BAR protein in the epithelial apical domain , illuminate molecular mechanisms that promote microvillar growth during enterocyte differentiation , and provide an evolutionary rationale on the targeting of IRTKS during EHEC infection . RESULTS IRTKS Localizes to the Tips of Microvilli in Differentiating Epithelial Cells Using 2D - liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) to deﬁne the mouse BB proteome , we previously identiﬁed IRTKS as one of 646 proteins enriched in BB fractions [ 33 ] . To examine the expression and localization of IRTKS , we stained mouse small intestinal organoids with an IRTKS - spe - ciﬁc antibody . Intestinal organoids are derived from isolated stem - cell - containing crypts ; in culture , these structures reseal and differentiate through formation of new crypt domains budding from a shared villus domain that encapsulates a closed lumen ( Figure 1A ) [ 42 , 43 ] . The resulting primary cultures are highly amenable to whole - mount imaging , which makes it easier to orient and capture full crypt - villus axes . Importantly , the accumulation of apical F - actin , which deﬁnes the crypt - vil - lus transition , is recapitulated in this system ( Figure 1A ) . In these cultures , IRTKS is enriched at the apical surface in both crypt and villus domain cells . However , expression is much higher in crypt domains ( Figures 1B and S1A ; Video S1 ) . Inter - estingly , line scans orthogonal to the apex of crypt cells re - vealed peak IRTKS signal close to microvillar tips ( 0 . 78 ± 0 . 21 ; base = 0 ; tips = 1 ; Figure 1C ) . To deﬁne IRTKS localization at higher resolution , we examined Ls174T - W4 ( W4 ) cells , an in - testinal epithelial cell line that can be induced to form microvilli [ 44 ] . W4 cells mimic the partially differentiated state of crypt cells and provide a model for studying IRTKS function in cells that have actively growing microvilli ( Videos S2 and S3 ) . Consistent with organoid staining , super - resolution structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) of endogenous IRTKS in W4 cells revealed puncta throughout the cytoplasm , as well as enrich - ment at microvillar tips ( Figures 1D and 1E ) . Thus , IRTKS is highly expressed in differentiating epithelial cells of the crypt and localizes to the tips of nascent microvilli . IRTKS Tracks the Distal Tips of Growing Microvilli We next examined IRTKS dynamics in live W4 cells expressing EGFP - IRTKS and mCherry - utrophin ( UtrCH ) [ 45 ] to label F - actin ( Figure 2A ; Video S3 ) . In kymographs created with lines along the microvillar axis , IRTKS tracked the tips of growing bundles , pro - ducing diagonal features with the slope indicating an elongation rate of (cid:1) 0 . 75 m m / min ( Figure 2B ) . Montages of individual micro - villi also showed IRTKS puncta persistently tracking the tips of newly emerging protrusions ( Figure 2C ; Video S4 ) . Of note , we were unable to detect clear examples of IRTKS tip tracking dur - ing microvillar retraction . This might suggest that IRTKS prefers the tips of growing bundles . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that retraction events may be obscured by the dy - namic movements of microvilli during these time lapses . To determine whether tip targeting was speciﬁc to the parallel actin bundles in epithelial microvilli , we examined the localization of EGFP - tagged IRTKS in B16F1 melanoma cells . Time - lapse imaging showed strong localization to the tips of dynamic ﬁlopo - dia , as well as an increase in the total number of ﬁlopodia over control cells ( Figures 2D – 2G ; Videos S5 and S6 ) . Together , these results suggest that the IRTKS tip - targeting mechanism senses general features of the distal tip compartment , such as outward membrane curvature and / or the enrichment of actin ﬁlament barbed ends . IRTKS Tip Targeting Is Driven by the N - Terminal I - BAR Domain To deﬁne the mechanism of IRTKS tip targeting , we examined the impact of eliminating or mutating speciﬁc structural motifs ( Figure 3A ) . A full - length EGFP - IRTKS construct enriched at the tips of W4 microvilli similar to endogenous IRTKS ( Figures 3B and S2A ) . A construct containing loss - of - function mutations ( W378K / W391K ) in the SH3 domain ( SH3 * ) [ 46 ] still displayed some tip targeting but also accumulated near the base of micro - villi ( Figures 3C and S2B ) . Deletion of the C - terminal WH2 domain ( D WH2 ) had no impact on tip targeting ( Figures 3D and S2C ) , whereas deletion of the N - terminal I - BAR domain ( D I - BAR ) completely eliminated all membrane localization and tip target - ing ( Figures 3E and S2D ) . The IRTKS I - BAR domain alone displayed targeting to the membrane and the tips of microvilli ( Figures 3F and S2E ) . Thus , IRTKS tip targeting is controlled pri - marily by the I - BAR domain but is reﬁned by the SH3 domain , likely through its interactions with binding partners . Current Biology 28 , 2876 – 2888 , September 24 , 2018 2877 IRTKS Promotes Microvillar Elongation Using Its SH3 and WH2 Domains Our analysis of IRTKS targeting mechanisms revealed that over - expression of variants signiﬁcantly impacted microvillar length ( Figure 3G ) . W4 cells overexpressing full - length IRTKS exhibited a minor increase in length over wild - type ( WT ) cells ( 2 . 7 ± 0 . 4 m m versus 2 . 5 ± 0 . 4 m m , respectively ) . However , SH3 * and D WH2 constructs signiﬁcantly decreased length ( 1 . 8 ± 0 . 4 m m and 1 . 9 ± 0 . 4 m m , respectively ) , likely due to a dominant negative effect . Impact on length also scaled with expression level ( Fig - ure 3H ) . Constructs lacking the I - BAR or consisting of the I - BAR domain alone did not impact microvillar length ( Figure 3G ) . Based on these data , we hypothesized that IRTKS plays a role in controlling microvillar length . To determine whether IRTKS is required for microvillar growth , we used short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) to knock down IRTKS in W4 cells ( Figures 3I and S2G ) and then examined the impact using confocal microscopy and SIM ( Figure 3J ) . IRTKS knockdown ( KD ) signiﬁcantly reduced the fraction of cells able to grow a BB ( 72 . 7 % ± 12 . 9 % in scramble control versus 50 . 1 % ± 15 . 7 % in KD ; Figure 3K ) and signiﬁcantly decreased microvillar length ( 2 . 5 ± 0 . 5 m m control versus 1 . 3 ± 0 . 2 m m KD ; Figure 3L ) . These perturbations were speciﬁc to loss of IRTKS , as a construct refractory to KD ( IRTKSr ) rescued the fraction of cells able to grow microvilli ( 71 . 7 % ± 14 . 9 % ) and microvillar length ( 2 . 7 ± 0 . 3 m m ; Figures 3K , 3L , and S2J ) . Interestingly , expression of refractory SH3 * and D WH2 constructs only partially rescued microvillar growth pa - rameters , and refractory D I - BAR and I - BAR constructs had no effect on microvillar length ( Figures 3K , 3L , and S2K – S2N ) . These overexpression and KD and rescue assays reveal that IRTKS is needed for normal microvillar elongation , which requires func - tional SH3 and actin - binding WH2 domains . 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 Normalized Microvillar Axis N o r m a li z e d I n t e n s i t y Base Tip 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 Normalized Microvillar Axis N o r m a li z e d I n t e n s i t y Base Tip A B C E D Figure 1 .

How the IRTKS SH3 domain contributes to micro - villar length control is less clear . To develop our understanding of these observations , we sought to identify a binding partner for this domain . Previous studies identiﬁed the IRTKS SH3 domain as a high - afﬁnity binding partner of the proline - rich ( PR ) motifs in the EHEC virulence factor , EspF u [ 40 ] . Sequence analysis of EspF u PR motifs implicates several mammalian pro - teins as potential IRTKS binding partners under normal condi - tions . One candidate that stands out based on high - sequence conservation is EPS8 ( Figure 4A ) , which exhibits actin bundling and capping activities through its C - terminal region ( Figure 4B ) [ 47 , 48 ] . Previous studies suggest that EPS8 targets to the tips of intestinal microvilli [ 47 , 49 ] , hair cell stereocilia [ 50 – 52 ] , and ﬁlopodia [ 53 ] , where it controls the length of these protrusions , although signiﬁcant questions remain regarding its mechanism of targeting and action in these different contexts . In W4 cells , endogenous EPS8 was highly enriched at the tips of microvilli ( Figures 4C and 4D ) and colocalized with endogenous IRTKS puncta at these sites ( Figures 4E – 4G ) . Whereas the majority of tip puncta contained both EPS8 and IRTKS , the stoichiometry of colocalization in the tip compartment was not ﬁxed ; this likely reﬂects structural variability inherent to the tips of individual Control IRTKS 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 N u m b e r o f F il opod i a / μ m * * * * A B C D E F G Figure 2 .

Finally , using in vitro pull - downs , we found that FLAG - tagged EPS8 interacted with full - length EGFP - tagged IRTKS ; we also conﬁrmed that the SH3 domain was sufﬁcient for binding ( Figure 4H ) . Thus , using its SH3 domain , IRTKS holds the poten - tial to interact with EPS8 at the tips of microvilli . Interestingly , co - expressing IRTKS and EPS8 in W4 cells did not signiﬁcantly elongate microvilli ( Figure S3B ) . This observa - tion might be due to the fact that , even under normal conditions , a major fraction of cellular G - actin is incorporated into microvillar actin bundles upon induction with doxycycline . We tested this by co - expressing IRTKS and EPS8 in cells that do not normally build BBs : B16F1 and HeLa cells . In both cell types , dual expres - sion dramatically increased the number of both dorsal and sub - strate - attached ﬁlopodia over control cells ( Figures S3C – S3F ; Video S9 ) , indicating that IRTKS and EPS8 can work together to stimulate ﬁnger - like protrusion growth .

Current Biology 28 , 2876 – 2888 , September 24 , 2018 2881 IRTKS Promotes EPS8 Enrichment at the Tips of Microvilli To further elucidate the functional relationship between EPS8 and IRTKS at microvillar tips , we examined the impact of IRTKS KD on EPS8 localization . Although some EPS8 was still present in the shortened microvilli on the surface of IRTKS KD cells ( Fig - ures 5A and 5B ) , we also found that cytosolic EPS8 levels were signiﬁcantly increased relative to controls ( Figures 5A – 5C ) , suggesting that IRTKS promotes the tip targeting of EPS8 under normal conditions . To test this concept , we generated a variant of EPS8 lacking the predicted IRTKS interacting motif ( EPS8 D PR1 ; Figures 4A and 4B ) . Strikingly , this variant localized in puncta throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 5D ) , with signiﬁcantly reduced tip targeting relative to EGFP - EPS8 ( Figure 5E ) . Using pull - downs , we also found that less EGFP - EPS8 D PR1 bound to a FLAG - tagged IRTKS SH3 bait relative to EGFP - EPS8 ( Fig - ure S4A ) . To further determine whether IRTKS is sufﬁcient to control EPS8 localization , we fused its SH3 domain to TOM20 , thus directing it to the surface of mitochondria .

See also Figure S4 . 2882 Current Biology 28 , 2876 – 2888 , September 24 , 2018 alone , a large fraction of endogenous EPS8 was sequestered to mitochondria ( Figures 5F and 5G ) . Microvillar length was also slightly decreased in these cells , likely due to the loss of EPS8 from the BB ( Figure 5I ) . Together , these results indicate that IRTKS can use its SH3 domain to promote the localization of EPS8 to microvillar tips . EPS8 Promotes Microvillar Elongation Previous studies implicated EPS8 in controlling the length of actin - bundle - supported protrusions [ 47 , 52 ] , and we conﬁrmed this in EPS8 - depleted W4 cells ( Figures 6A , 6B , and S4B ) . Inter - estingly , EPS8 KD phenocopied IRTKS KD ( Figures 3J – 3L ) by reducing the fraction of cells able to assemble BBs ( 71 . 9 % ± 11 . 7 % scramble versus 26 . 5 % ± 10 . 7 % EPS8 KD ; Figure 6C ) and decreasing microvillar length ( 2 . 5 ± 0 . 4 m m scramble versus 1 . 6 ± 0 . 3 m m EPS8 KD ; Figure 6D ) . Both microvillar growth pa - rameters were rescued by expression of a refractory variant of EGFP - EPS8 but only partially rescued with a refractory EGFP - EPS8 D PR1 ( Figures 6C , 6D , and S4B – S4D ) . Thus , EPS8 is also required for normal microvillar elongation though a mechanism that requires the PR1 motif . IRTKS Uses EPS8 - Dependent and Independent Mechanisms to Elongate Microvilli Our results up to this point suggest a model where IRTKS pro - motes microvillar elongation using two distinct mechanisms : ( 1 ) a direct mechanism that involves its actin - binding WH2 domain and ( 2 ) an indirect mechanism that involves SH3 - domain - dependent recruitment of EPS8 , which in turn exerts its own elongation activity . As proposed , both mechanisms require functional IRTKS . If this model is accurate , EPS8 co - expression should rescue microvillar shortening observed in response to overexpression of IRTKS D WH2 , but not IRTKS SH3 * ( Figures 3D and 3G ) . Indeed , EPS8 expression rescued microvillar length in cells expressing IRTKS D WH2 but had no impact on the length reduction caused by IRTKS SH3 * ( Figures 6E – 6H ) . A second prediction is that a functional SH3 / PR1 inter - action should be required for EPS8 to increase ﬁlopodia numbers when co - expressed with IRTKS in B16 cells . Consis - tent with this proposal , co - expressing EPS8 with IRTKS SH3 * or expressing EPS8 D PR1 on its own did not impact ﬁlopodia number over controls ( Figures S5A , S5D , and S5E ) . However , co - expressing EPS8 with IRTKS D WH2 signiﬁcantly increased protrusion numbers ( Figures S5B and S5E ) , likely because EPS8 can still localize using the intact IRTKS SH3 domain . Simi - larly , co - expressing IRTKS with EPS8 D PR1 signiﬁcantly increased protrusion numbers ( Figures S5C and S5E ) , likely because IRTKS is able to target independent of EPS8 . A third prediction based on our proposed model is that EPS8 overex - pression should be unable to rescue the shortened microvilli observed with IRTKS KD ( Figure 3L ) . We conﬁrmed this experi - mentally ; EPS8 overexpression had no impact on microvillar length in cells lacking IRTKS ( Figures 6I and 6J ) . A fourth and ﬁnal prediction states that IRTKS overexpression should rescue the shortening of microvilli observed with EPS8 KD ( Figure 6D ) , but this rescue would require the IRTKS WH2 domain . We found that microvillar shortening in EPS8 KD cells was in fact rescued by overexpression of IRTKS , but not IRTKS D WH2 ( Figures 6 K and 6L ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings indicate that IRTKS func - tions to elongate microvilli using EPS8 - dependent and indepen - dent mechanisms , which represent structurally distinct and thus experimentally separable activities . DISCUSSION IRTKS has been studied extensively as a target of EHEC viru - lence factors [ 38 , 39 , 54 , 55 ] . EHEC is a Shiga - toxin - secreting attaching / effacing ( A / E ) pathogen [ 56 ] that colonizes distal small intestine or proximal colon epithelium by effacing microvilli and building adherent ‘‘pedestals’’ on the apical surface [ 57 ] . To build pedestals , EHEC injects host cells with virulence factors that remodel the actin cytoskeleton [ 58 ] . IRTKS is targeted by the virulence factor EspF u [ 59 ] , which uses tandem polyproline mo - tifs to bind tightly to the SH3 domain [ 40 ] . This interaction is notable due to its high afﬁnity ( K D (cid:1) 500 nM ) [ 40 ] . The apically localized IRTKS - EspF u complex recruits N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 , leading to a massive induction of actin assembly and pedestal formation beneath EHEC [ 41 , 59 ] . The current study may help explain why EHEC evolved to target IRTKS using EspF u in its pathogenic mechanism . Our ﬁndings reveal that IRTKS is well positioned and contains the appropriate domains and activities to inﬂuence apical actin assembly in response to microbial contact . The studies presented here focused on elucidating the normal function of IRTKS in the apical domain . We found that IRTKS tar - gets to and tracks the distal tips of growing microvilli ( Figures 2B and 2C ) , where the barbed ends of core actin ﬁlaments interface with highly curved plasma membrane . Combined with results from our overexpression and loss - of - function experiments and the demonstrated physical association with the established pro - trusion - elongation factor EPS8 [ 47 , 49 ] , our results indicate IRTKS plays an important role in elongating microvilli . Indeed , IRTKS KD eliminated BB formation in (cid:1) 50 % of the W4 cells assayed ( Figure 3K ) . In cells that were still able to form a BB , IRTKS KD signiﬁcantly shortened microvilli compared to controls ( Figure 3L ) . Because short microvilli still form in KD cells , IRTKS - driven elongation may involve detection of outwardly curved regions of plasma membrane at some point after initiation of microvillar growth . Our molecular dissection of IRTKS function revealed that the N - terminal I - BAR domain is the primary driver of tip targeting . Deletion of the I - BAR domain completely eliminated targeting to microvillar tips ( Figures 3E and S3D ) . The I - BAR domain alone was able to tip target but also exhibited general plasma mem - brane labeling ( Figures 3F and S3E ) . This suggests that IRTKS probably requires additional motifs or interactions with other fac - tors to focus its enrichment at microvillar tips . Indeed , mutation of the SH3 domain ligand - binding pocket also disrupted localiza - tion , although some distal tip labeling persisted ( Figures 3C and S3B ) . Although it is tempting to speculate that SH3 domain targeting is related to EPS8 binding , IRTKS still localized to microvillar tips in cells lacking EPS8 ( Figure 6K ) . Our studies revealed that the IRTKS WH2 domain is critical for microvillar elongation . Whereas WH2 domain deletion had no impact on IRTKS localization , overexpression of IRTKS D WH2 exerted a dominant negative effect on protrusion length ( Figures 3D , 3G , and 3H ) , likely mediated by interactions with endoge - nous IRTKS .

Exactly how the IRTKS WH2 domain contributes to elongation remains unclear , but WH2 - domain - containing proteins in general have been implicated in actin ﬁlament nucleation and elongation [ 60 ] . IRTKS is different from many of these other factors in two ways . Whereas most WH2 domain molecules contain multiple copies of this 17 - to 20 - amino - acid motif arranged in tandem , IRTKS contains only a single WH2 motif . Moreover , the IRTKS WH2 domain is divergent , containing ‘‘LRPT’’ rather than the conserved ‘‘LKKV’’ motif that typically contributes to monomer binding ; IRTKS is also missing canonical hydrophobic residues upstream of this motif [ 60 ] . Despite these distinctions , the IRTKS WH2 domain does bind actin and may prefer ﬁlaments over monomers [ 35 ] . Interestingly , the WH2 domain of closely related IRSp53 binds strongly to G - actin despite containing an IRTKS - like ‘‘LKPT’’ motif [ 29 ] . Espin , which functions in the elongation of microvilli and stereocilia [ 16 , 19 , 61 , 62 ] , also contains a WH2 domain characterized by LKPT [ 63 ] . The espin WH2 domain binds to G - actin and may function to increase local monomer concentration at the distal tips , which could promote elongation . Notably , espin - 2B exerts its effects on microvillar length without signiﬁcantly altering F - actin treadmilling rates in microvilli [ 16 ] . This is consistent with our ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) measurements on W4 cells ex - pressing EGFP - b - actin , which revealed IRTKS KD had minimal impact on BB actin turnover ( Figures S2H and S2I ; Videos S7 and S8 ) . Our ﬁndings suggest that the IRTKS SH3 domain also contrib - utes to microvillar length control ( Figures 3C , 3G , and 3H ) , likely through its interaction with EPS8 , an established elongation fac - tor that enriches at the tips of actin protrusions [ 47 , 52 , 64 ] . Inter - action with EPS8 was predicted in previous structural studies as its proline - rich motifs are nearly identical to those found in EspF u peptides that bind IRTKS with high afﬁnity [ 40 ] . Interestingly , higher cytoplasmic levels of EPS8 were seen with both the IRTKS KD and in cells expressing a variant of EPS8 lacking PR1 , a predicted IRTKS binding motif ( Figures 5A – 5E ) . Forced targeting of the IRTKS SH3 domain to the mitochondrial surface also recruited EPS8 to these sites ( Figures 5F and 5G ) . Thus , we propose that IRTKS and EPS8 form a complex at the tips of microvilli , which stabilizes EPS8 in this compartment ( Figure 7 ) . Once at the tips , both IRTKS and EPS8 hold the potential to contribute to core bundle elongation : IRTKS through its WH2 domain and EPS8 through its actin bundling and capping activ - ities [ 47 , 48 ] . Our ﬁndings indicate these represent separable , parallel activities that both depend on IRTKS ( Figure 7 ) . Of note , overexpression of the I - BAR domain alone did not impact microvillar length ( Figure 3G ) . This might seem to contra - dict early reports suggesting I - BAR domains exhibit actin - bundling activity [ 31 , 35 , 65 ] . Yet our data are consistent with studies on IRSp53 and MIM , which indicate that membrane binding rather than actin ﬁlament bundling is the primary function of this domain in cells [ 66 ] . We note here that our results do not rule out the possibility that the IRTKS I - BAR domain exerts direct effects on membrane mechanical properties that facilitate micro - villar elongation [ 67 ] . Early models of microvillar growth emphasized the role of F - actin bundling proteins in protrusion assembly [ 17 , 68 ] . How - ever , more recent studies on a mouse model lacking all three established bundling proteins , ﬁmbrin , villin , and espin , revealed that microvilli still form [ 22 ] . Our studies highlight new mecha - nisms that also contribute to this biologically robust process . Future studies must focus on understanding how the IRTKS / EPS8 complex interfaces with known polarity pathways during enterocyte differentiation and on deﬁning the temporal sequence of molecular recruitment that drives microvillar growth .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Cell Culture Ls174T - W4 cells ( female Hs colon epithelial cells ) were cultured in DMEM with high glucose and 2 mM L - glutamine supplemented with 10 % tetracycline - free fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , G418 ( 1 mg / ml ) , blasticidin ( 10 m g / ml ) , and phleomycin ( 20 m g / ml ) . The cell line was obtained directly from Dr . Hans Clevers ( Utrecht University , Netherlands ) and has not been additionally authenticated beyond conﬁrmation of polarization with the addition of DOX . B16F1 ( Male Mm melanoma cells ) and HeLa cells ( female Hs cervix epithelial cells ) were cultured in DMEM with high glucose and 2 mM L - glutamine supplemented with 10 % FBS . Intestinal organoids were generated from P42 - 56 mice ( C57BL / 6 , both genders ) . Organoids were suspended in 50 m L matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) and cultured in advanced DMEM / F12 ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with the following growth factors : 500 ng / ml EGF ( Invitrogen ) , 100 ng / ml Noggin ( R & D Systems ) , 500 ng / ml R - spondin 1 ( R & D Systems ) , and 1mM N - Acetylcysteine ( Sigma ) . All cells were grown at 37 (cid:3) C and 5 % CO2 . METHOD DETAILS Transfections and lentivirus production All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the cells were allowed to recover overnight ( ON ) . For KD experiments , lentivirus was generated by co - transfecting HEK293FT cells ( Fetal Hs embryonic epithelial cells ; T75 ﬂasks at 80 % conﬂuency ) with 6 m g of pLKO . 1 shRNA KD plasmids ( Open Biosystems ; IRTKS , TRCN0000005350 ; EPS8 , TRCN0000061545 ; scramble control [ 69 ] ) , 4 m g of psPAX2 packaging plasmid , and 0 . 8 m g of pMD2 . G en - velope plasmid using FuGENE 6 ( Promega ) . For efﬁcient lentiviral production , cells were incubated for 48 hr , then lentivirus - contain - ing media was collected and concentrated with Lenti - X concentrator ( Clontech ) . To transduce W4 cells with lentivirus , the media was supplemented with 6 ug / ml polybrene ( Sigma ) and the lentiviral shRNAs .

The cells were then seeded into plates or ﬂasks and incubated ON in the absence or presence of 1 m g / ml doxycycline , and then prepared for immunoﬂuorescence or SDS - PAGE . For rescue experiments , cells were transiently transfected 48 hours after the second lentiviral infection using Lipofectamine 2000 , induced with 1 ug / ml doxycycline ON , and ﬁxed the following morning for immunoﬂuorescence . Immunoﬂuorescence For SIM imaging , cells were plated on glass coverslips and allowed to adhere for at least 6 hr ( W4 cells ) or 3 hr ( HeLa cells ) . Cells were washed with pre - warmed phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and ﬁxed with warm 4 % paraformaldehyde / PBS for 15 min at 37 (cid:3) C . Cells were then washed three times with PBS and permeablized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 15 min at room temperature . Cells were once again washed three times with PBS and blocked for 1 hr at 37 (cid:3) C in 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) / PBS . Primary antibodies anti - IRTKS ( 2 m g / ml , HPA021257 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , anti - EPS8 ( 1 m g / ml Cat # 610143 ; BD Biosciences ) , anti - GFP ( 50 m g / ml , GFP - 1020 ; Aves Labs ) , or anti - mCherry ( 1 m g / ml , Cat # M11217 ; Invitrogen ) were diluted in PBS and incubated with cells at 37 (cid:3) C for 1 hr , followed by four washes with PBS . Cells were then incubated for 1 hr with goat anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 F ( ab’ ) 2 Fragment ( 2 m g / ml , A11070 ; Molecular Probes ) , goat anti - mouse Alexa Fluor 488 F ( ab’ ) 2 Fragment ( 2 m g / ml , A11017 ; Molecular Probes ) , or Alexa Fluor 568 – phal - loidin or Alexa Flour 647 - phalloidin ( 1 : 200 , A12380 and A22287 respectively ; Invitrogen ) at room temperature . Coverslips were then washed four times with PBS and mounted on glass slides in ProLong Gold ( P36930 ; Invitrogen ) . Organoids were processed in a similar manner as above with some minor modiﬁcations : 1 ) Organoids were ﬁxed with warm 4 % paraformaldehyde / PBS for 40 min at 37 (cid:3) C , 2 ) permeablized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 30 min , and 3 ) primary antibodies were incubated with organoids ON at 4 (cid:3) C . For live - cell TIRF imaging , transfected B16F1 cells were seeded onto 35 mm glass bottom dishes ( Invitro Scientiﬁc , D35 - 20 - 1 . 5 - N ) coated with 25 m g / ml laminin ( Sigma , L2020 ) in PBS and allowed to adhere for 2 to 3 hours . Images of single cells were acquired every 5 s for 15 minutes . For live - cell confocal imaging of W4 cells , transfected cells were plated on glass - bottom dishes with 1 m g / ml of doxycycline and allowed to adhere for 6 hours . Images of single W4 cells were acquired every 5 s for 30 minutes or continuously for 4 minutes . For FRAP of scramble and IRTKS KD , images were acquired every 5 s with an initial acquisition of 15 s followed by bleaching and an additional 10 minutes . Bleaching was performed within a 20 m m 2 ROI using 30 % 405 laser power for a duration of 100 ms . All live cells were maintained in a humid environment at 37 (cid:3) C and 5 % CO2 using a stage - top incubation system . Image acquisition was controlled with Nikon Elements software . Cloning and Constructs pTOB7 - IRTKS ( Open Biosystems ) containing full - length human IRTKS was purchased and shuttled into a pEGFP - C1 vector ( Clon - tech ) adapted for Gateway cloning using the Gateway conversion kit ( Invitrogen ) ( herein referred to as ‘‘Gateway - adapted pEGFP - C1’’ ) . The resulting clone , pEGFP - C1 - IRTKS ( aa 1 - 511 ) , was veriﬁed by sequencing . IRTKS D WH2 ( aa 1 - 482 ) , I - BAR alone ( aa 1 - 249 ) , D I - BAR ( aa 250 - 511 ) , WH2 alone ( aa 473 - 511 ) constructs were generated by PCR and TOPO cloned into the pCR8 Gateway entry vector ( Invitrogen ) . To generate the IRTKS - SH3 * construct , mutations W378K and W391K were introduced into pEGFP - IRTKS using site - directed mutagenesis . All entry vectors were veriﬁed by DNA sequencing and then shuttled into the destination vector Gateway - adapted pEGFP - C1 . pDONR221 EPS8 ( Open Biosystems ) was also purchased and shuttled into Gateway - adapted pEGFP - C1 to generate pEGFP - C1 - EPS8 ( aa 1 - 822 ) and veriﬁed by sequencing . EPS8 D PR1 ( deleted aa 198 - 231 ) construct was generated by reverse PCR and TOPO cloned into the pCR8 Gateway entry vector . The mCherry - tagged UtrCH used for B16F1 , HeLa , and W4 live - cell imaging was purchased from Addgene ( 26740 , deposited by W . Bement ) . The TOM20 - mCherry construct was generously provided by the Kaverina Lab ( Vanderbilt ) , and the SH3 domain of IRTKS was fused to the C terminus of mCherry . A non - targeting scramble control shRNA ( Addgene ; plasmid 1864 ) , IRTKS KD shRNA , and EPS8 KD shRNA clones were expressed in pLKO . 1 , cor - responding to TRC clones TRCN0000005350 and TRCN0000061545 ( Sigma ) respectively . To generate an IRTKS construct refrac - tory to KD , three silent mutations were introduced into full - length IRTKS using site - directed mutagenesis . For the IRTKS shRNA , which targets nucleotides ( nts ) 1190 – 1211 , nt 1190 ( c / a ) , nt 1192 ( t / a ) , nt 1196 ( a / t ) , nt 1197 ( g / c ) , and nt 1198 ( t / g ) were mutated . These silent mutations were also introduced into pEGFP - IRTKS SH3 * and pEGFP - D WH2 . For the EPS8 shRNA , which targets EPS8 nts 1712 – 1732 , nt 1718 ( c / t ) , nt 1720 ( g / a ) , nt 1724 ( t / a ) , nt 1725 ( c / g ) , and nt 1726 ( t / c ) were mutated . The same nts were mutated in the EGFP - EPS8 D PR1 refractory construct . Western Blot Analysis IRTKS and EPS8 knockdown and scramble cells were seeded into T25 ﬂasks and allowed to grow for 24 hr . Cells were harvested with a cell scraper , pelleted at low speed , and lysed using ice - cold RIPA buffer containing 2 mM ATP , cOmplete ULTRA tablets ( Roche ) , and 1 mM Pefabloc ( Roche ) . The resulting cell lysates were then centrifuged at 15 , 000 RPM for 20 min and the soluble material was diluted with Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 95 (cid:3) C for 5 min . Equal sample volumes were loaded on a 4 % – 12 % Nu - Page gradient gel ( Invitrogen ) and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 25V for 16 hr . Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 10 % milk - PBS and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( PBS - T ) ON at 4 (cid:3) C . The primary antibodies used were anti - IRTKS ( 0 . 08 m g / ml , HPA021257 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , anti - EPS8 ( 0 . 1 m g / ml , Cat # 610143 ; BD Biosciences ) and anti - glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( 0 . 5 m g / ml , Cat # 3907 ; Cell Signaling ) . Membranes were then washed four times with PBS - T and incubated with donkey anti - rabbit 800 IRdye ( 0 . 01 ug / ml , 926 - 32213 ; Li - Cor ) or donkey anti - mouse 800 IRdye ( 0 . 01 m g / ml , 926 - 32212 ; Li - Cor ) for 30 min . Membranes were washed with PBS - T an additional four times and imaged using a Li - Cor Odyssey infrared imaging system . The same protocol was used to generate EGFP - tagged IRTKS constructs for expression levels . Current Biology 28 , 2876 – 2888 . e1 – e4 , September 24 , 2018 e3 Images of membranes were cropped and adjusted using ImageJ ( NIH ) and relative protein expression levels were quantiﬁed using the signal from GAPDH to normalize the samples from loading . Pulldown Assays COS7 cells were grown in T75 ﬂasks to 80 % conﬂuency and transfected with pull - down constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 ac - cording to the manufacturer’s protocol . After 48 hr , cells were lysed using 1 mL of ice - cold Cellytic M buffer ( Sigma ) containing 2 mM ATP , 1mM Pefabloc ( Roche ) , and cOmplete ULTRA tablets ( Roche ) and centrifuged at 15 , 000 RPM . The soluble material was recovered after centrifugation and incubated with a 30 m L bed volume pre - equilibrated anti - FLAG M2 resin ( Sigma ) for 2 hr with continuous rocking at 4 (cid:3) C . Resin and bound material were pelleted at 300 RPM , washed four times using RIPA buffer supple - mented with 2 mM ATP , 1 mM Pefabloc ( Roche ) , and cOmplete ULTRA tablets ( Roche ) , and eluted by boiling in SDS buffer to recover bound material . Resin - bound material was detected by western analysis with the following antibody dilutions : mouse anti - FLAG M2 ( 10 m g / ml ; Sigma cat . # F3165 ) and chicken anti - EGFP ( 2 m g / ml ; Aves Labs cat . # GFP - 1020 ) . The pull - down assays were repeated three times , and the results shown are representative . Microscopy SIM of W4 and HeLa cells was performed using an Applied Precision DeltaVision OMX equipped with a 60X Plan - Apochromat N / 1 . 42 NA oil immersion objective ( Olympus ) using softWorx software ( GE Healthcare ) . Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a Nikon A1R laser - scanning confocal microscope . Live cell B16F1 imaging was performed on a Nikon TiE inverted light micro - scope equipped with 488 and 561 nm excitation LASERs , a 100x / 1 . 49 NA TIRF objective , and an Andor Neo sCMOS detector . Im - aging was performed using near - TIRF illumination , where the incident angle of the LASER was adjusted to increase the depth of penetration of the excitation ﬁeld . Live - cell imaging of W4 cells was performed on a Nikon Ti2 equipped with a Yokogawa CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal unit , 488 and 561 nm LASERs , a 100x / 1 . 49 NA objective , and a Photometrics PRIME 95B sCMOS detector . Images were contrast enhanced and cropped using FIJI / ImageJ software ( NIH ) . Further details regarding the preparation of cells for imaging and data analysis and quantiﬁcation can be found in the STAR Methods . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS All image analysis was performed using FIJI or Nikon Elements software and all quantitative data are from at least three independent experiments . To perform line - scan analysis , a line was drawn along the axis of microvilli that were entirely in plane with a distinct tip and base visible . The intensity of the IRTKS or EPS8 signal was recorded and normalized with the lowest intensity set to 0 and the maximum set to 1 . The microvillar length axis from individual scans was also normalized with the base set to 0 and the tip set to 1 . Normalized line - scans were then plotted together and ﬁt to a single Gaussian using nonlinear regression ( Prism v . 7 , GraphPad ) . For quantiﬁcation of percentage of cells with BB , cells were scored as BB positive if they displayed polarized F - actin accumulation as visualized using a 40X objective on a Nikon A1R laser - scanning confocal microscope . The same microscope and objective was used to quantify the percent of EPS8 and mitochondrial localization , and cells were scored as localized when they a majority of the signal colocalized with the mitochondria . Microvillar length measurements were performed on projected SIM images by tracing individual microvillar actin bundles using FIJI . For analyses in which individual microvilli were measured , at least 10 microvillar actin bundles were scored per cell and at least 25 cells measured per experiment . In B16F1 melanoma cells , ﬁlopodia number was quan - tiﬁed in ImageJ by counting the number of actin protrusions on the outside of a cell . The BB : cytosol ratio measured in W4 cells was deﬁned as the ratio of the mean intensities from these two regions . Percent BB and microvillar length data were analyzed with a D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test to determine normal distribution . Normally distributed data were statistically analyzed to determine signiﬁcance using the unpaired Student’s t test . Statistical analyses performed are stated in the ﬁgure legends . All graphs were generated and statistical analyses performed using Prism ( v . 7 , GraphPad ) . e4 Current Biology 28 , 2876 – 2888 . e1 – e4 , September 24 , 2018
