Based on the related citation data of LIS from JCR ranging from 2003 to 2018 , we not only focus on LIS’s knowledge destinations and knowledge balance , but also propose Citation Peak Lag ( CPL ) as an emerging indicator to measure the speed of knowledge exchange . We have proved that LIS is one of the pivots which integrate knowledge coming from both hard science and soft science , while its ratios of export to import are quite different in all sorts of categories . By analyzing the changes of LIS’s Citing CPL and Cited CPL over time , we found that the former is generally bigger than the latter , and we observed the different patterns of CPL in related categories of LIS . Moreover , we also discovered that hard science ( e . g . Computer Science ) has lower CPL than soft science ( e . g . Business , Management ) and the concrete patterns of knowledge waves vary from fields to fields . This study fills the research gap in analyzing bi - directional knowledge flows of LIS , and measuring the velocity of knowledge diffusion .

Interdisciplinary collaborations are widely considered as a hothouse for innovation , and the plausible approach to solve the world’s most challenging problems [ 2 , 3 ] . Interdisciplinary research has brought different context and perspectives into the original research area [ 4 ] , complementing capabilities [ 5 ] and addressing real - life problems [ 7 ] by emphasizing and promoting knowledge exchange and cross - disciplinary collaboration [ 8 , 9 ] . Library and Information Science ( LIS ) has been heralded as a highly interdisciplinary field by a number of scholars [ 10 , 11 12 13 ] . The LIS literature relies heavily on contributions from scholars working outside , such as Computer Science , Communication , and Business [ 14 , 15 ] . The interdisciplinarity of LIS has allowed it to serve as a reference for other social science disciplines and more technologically - driven disciplines such as Computer Science [ 16 ] . The integration of collaboration and research across the boundaries of a single discipline produces interdisciplinary areas and expertise that are important for the development of the discipline . Therefore , studies analyzing the knowledge imported and exported between the LIS and other disciplines has gained much attention . Since the path and extent of knowledge flows are largely unobservable in the process of knowledge transfer , it has been generally assumed that citations from one discipline to another can be used as a proxy to characterize and quantify knowledge flows , which provide a theoretical base for empirical studies on knowledge export [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] . Some research studied the scientific trading between different disciplines [ 18 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ] , which revealed the knowledge permeability and presented the pattern of knowledge exchange between different disciplines . In these studies , the application of the “trading metaphor” in citation analysis allows researchers to focus on a clustering group of disciplines . Moreover , knowledge exporters and importers are identified , while the authors only consider the two ends ( exporter and importer ) of knowledge flows . Consequently , the concrete KEYWORDS Knowledge diffusion ; citation lag ; library and information science ; interdisciplinary studies ; knowledge export ; knowledge import ACM Reference format : Renli W , Hanqin Y , Wenxuan S and Shuksin Ng . 2020 .

However , there are differences in knowledge diffusion among disciplines in terms of time and speed . Some articles become instantly cited , whereas others are unnoticed for some time before they are discovered or rediscovered [ 24 ] . In addition , due to the degree of correlation , some studies suggested that references from other discipline will take more time than those from their own discipline [ 25 , 26 ] . The time delay has been defined as “citation lag” . According to some specific articles [ 27 ] , the common definition of citation lag is the interval between the time at which an article is published and the time at which it receives its first citation [ 25 , 26 , 27 ] . However , for a discipline , the citation data of all articles published in a given year is less affected by the citation of an individual article . Therefore , this definition is not applicable when studying citation rates of the entire discipline . Actually , in this paper , it is found that the higher the number of citations , the more obvious the citation peaks , which are followed by a decline . The cumulative citation peak can represent the contribution and impact of one discipline on other discipline . Therefore , we define this cumulative citation curve as Knowledge Wave , introducing the theoretical research of citation lag to the category level , and propose the concept of Citation Peak Lag ( CPL ) as a measurement of knowledge diffusion speed among disciplines . In this article , Citation Peak Lag ( CPL ) refers to the time interval between the highest citation year and the observation year . For category A , its CPL can be divided into citing CPL and cited CPL . The citing CPL of A represents the time delay occurring when category A cites the work from category B , and the time delay can be used to measure the speed that category A imports knowledge from category B . Besides , the cited CPL of A represents the time delay occurring when category A is cited by category B , and the time delay indicates the speed that category A exports its knowledge to category B . Our research aims to answer the following questions : a ) What are the major destinations of knowledge trade of LIS and what is the status of these knowledge flows ? b ) What is the actual situation of Citation Peak Lag ( both citing CPL and cited CPL ) of LIS ? c ) Are there any general rules of LIS’s CPL and knowledge waves over the time ? Our study makes several contributions : a ) Citation lag is introduced to the category level , and it is able to be applied into more macroscopic scale . The introduction of CPL also leads to a set of methods for bidirectional measurement of the knowledge diffusion speed . b ) This paper draw attention to the knowledge import and export of LIS , mainly focusing on its destinations , proportions , CPL , growth rates and so on . c ) The rules and patterns of LIS’s CPL and knowledge waves in different categories and fields are discussed and compared by visualization and several indicators . 2 Related work 2 . 1 Citation Lag Citation Lag , regarded as the time delay between the publication year of a specific scientific literature and its citation year , reflects the time needed for other scholars to response [ 28 ] , and to some extent , it estimates the speed of knowledge diffusion . However , the time delay of citation is not only related to the subject of the citation process [ 29 ] , but also to the nature of the discipline . Understanding this process can provide a basis for further analysis of interdisciplinary knowledge transfer [ 25 ] . A study of the cross - field impact of the physics department paid attention to the citation lag for the first time . Moed et al . [ 27 ] hold the view that where the citing publications originate may influence the successive citation pattern of the field . In his research , citation lag was defined as the time spanning between an article’s publication and its first citation . Subsequent studies have shown that there is indeed a lag in knowledge exchange represented by citation data between different scientific fields . The study of Rinia et al . [ 25 ] revealed that the speed of incorporating knowledge from other disciplines appears to differ sharply among disciplines . It is generally regarded that intra - discipline communication is more timely than inter - discipline communication , which means the time delay of citation within disciplines is shorter [ 26 ] . The time distribution of references can also be used to measure the speed of knowledge import and export . Amat et al . [ 30 ] measured the speed at which diverse groups incorporate new knowledge through the difference between the half - life and the median age of the references . In addition , Nakamura et al . [ 31 ] introduced the indicator of citation lag creatively . They utilized the citation lag analysis of inter - and intra - clusters extracted by citation network analysis as a new indicator to represent the speed of knowledge diffusion in subfields in the supply chain research . 2 . 2 The knowledge diffusion of LIS The knowledge diffusion perspective based on citation and the maturity of citation network analysis methods provide a good research framework and theoretical support for knowledge diffusion research [ 32 ] . Liao et al . [ 33 ] pointed out that the impact of Library and Information Science ( LIS ) journals can be investigated from a novel perspective — the knowledge contribution to peer journals in LIS . The frontier of LIS development and the decline of related research fields can also be predicted and verified through citations . By a nalyzing LIS’s research articles published in core LIS journals , Tuomaala et al . [ 34 ] revealed how the research publications are distributed according to the topics , and explored the foci of LIS research and their coherence , changes , and even neglected areas . Through analyzing the author co - citation and bibliographic coupling of the intellectual structure of Information Science from 2006 to 2010 , Zhao et al . [ 35 ] found that web technologies improved continuously , especially at the research front , and at the same time , the network science’s influence expands , whereas the AP - L - 4 : Scholarly Knowledge - 2 JCDL ’20 , August 1 – 5 , 2020 , Virtual Event , China 198 influence of both the information retrieval systems and webometrics specialties seems to shrink . In addition , previous research mainly focused on the disciplinary and national contributions to LIS [ 15 ] . There are many studies on LIS’ preferences in citing works from other disciplines to explore its relationship with these disciplines [ 36 , 37 ] . Previous endeavors also further explored the two - way knowledge exchange between LIS and other disciplines , but they mainly focused on the particular disciplines or research fields , rather than the knowledge diffusion speed and subtle changes over time . In our research , efforts have been made to inspect and deconstruct the knowledge diffusion speed between LIS and other disciplines . Considering the broader trend exploration , we introduced the Biglan model , which has been updated and refined to follow the development of contemporary discipline , to map categories to science types [ 38 , 39 ] . Biglan Anthony [ 40 , 41 ] proposed the discipline classification scheme in which academic areas were clustered based on their ( a ) concern with a single paradigm ( dimension I , consisting of hard science and soft science ) , ( b ) concern with their application ( dimension II , consisting of pure science and applied science ) , and ( c ) concern with the life system ( dimension III , consisting of life system and nonlife system ) . Dimension I and dimension II have been widely applied to explore disciplinary differences by researchers from a variety of disciplines , such as LIS , education , and language and linguistics [ 42 , 43 , 44 ] , while dimension III is generally less recognized and less cited than other dimensions [ 39 ] . Thus , our paper also mainly used dimension I and II as criteria to analyze the comprehensive features and dynamic change of different types of disciplines . 3 Data and Method 3 . 1 Data Our research is based on the data from Journal Citation Reports ( JCR ) . According to the research purpose , we mainly selected the data from the field of Information Science and Library Science ( LIS ) . For each year from 2003 to 2018 , the cited category data of LIS which is the record of LIS cited by journals , and the citing category data of LIS which is the record of LIS citing journals both have been taken into account . The original dataset includes the relevant 1 , 030 , 215 LIS ’s cited data from 40 , 258 journa ls and the rele vant 2 , 087 , 238 LIS’s citing data from 199 , 748 journals . Each journal record in a certain year contains the citation frequency distribution of reference object over the past decade . For the main focus of the study was on LIS and other categories , we obtained the basic data of journals from JCR , including journal titles , their abbreviation , impact factors , and especially their categories respectively . This category system coming from Web of Science ( WOS ) has been accepted and utilized in many studies [ 45 , 46 ] . Based on the category - labeled information , we mapped and aggregated most of the journal - level records into different categories . The extracted dataset provides bibliometric data between LIS and other 229 categories from the perspective of time . Furthermore , the framework of the Biglan model was introduced to detect the macro trends . The reasons why we choose the Biglan model are as follows : ( 1 ) The dimensions of the Bigland model enable us to distinguish the 2 key factors th at may affect citation lag , discipline’s nature and their role . For the former , previous research has demonstrated that there are totally different knowledge basis and research paradigms between natural science and social and humanities science [ 47 ] , which leads to their diverse states in knowledge transfer . For the later , different purposes , methods , systems and outcomes of theoretical and applied research are naturally reflected in their knowledge flows [ 48 ] , and lead to their complementary roles in science world . ( 2 ) The Bigland model can fit our research objectives well and meet the granularity requirements of our analysis . Due to the highly interdisciplinary characteristic of LIS , these categories that interact closely with it are also distinct in their properties , which makes the four classes feasible . The convergence of categories can not only avoid the redundancy caused by the category - level analysis , but also use cluster effects to grasp the overall trends . Thus , all categories were divided into four types of Biglan : Hard and Pure science ( HP ) , Hard and Applied science ( HA ) , Soft and Pure science ( SP ) , as well as Soft and Applied science ( SA ) . We mainly used 54 most related categories ( including LIS itself ) in this paper , which were extracted from the categories that once presented in TOP 30 cited or citing list of the LIS . ( Because of image length limitation , we only used 40 categories in figure 1 , which are extracted from TOP 20 list ) . More details of classifications are shown in Appendix . A . Table 1 shows an example of polymerized dataset that LIS was cited by the category “Computer Science , Information Systems” in 2018 . The record consisting of a list of data series represents the frequency distribution of the publication year of references between 2009 - 2018 , and summarizes the citations from Computer Science , Information Systems to LIS occurred that year . Besides , the “allYrs” f ield indicates the total cited frequency in 2018 , and the “type” fie ld shows the corresponding type of the Biglan model each category belongs to . 3 . 2 Methods A four - step method is employed . First of all , we synthesize annual citing and cited data of LIS , and then rank the categories according to the corresponding citation frequency to select the related ones . Then we calculate several characteristics , including average citation counts , cited and citing ratios , and five - year growth rates , to explore their relationships and historical changes . Table 1 : A snapshot of the dataset Category 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 allYrs rest type COMPUTER SCIENCE , INFORMATION SYSTEMS 789 1010 1048 1066 1394 1454 1542 1382 886 308 17750 6871 HA AP - L - 4 : Scholarly Knowledge - 2 JCDL ’20 , August 1 – 5 , 2020 , Virtual Event , China 199 In the second step , we calculate and make use of Citation Peak Lag ( CPL ) to measure the speed and grasp the trend of knowledge diffusion between LIS and intimate categories from the standpoints of knowledge import and export . In the third step , we further analyze the status of LIS’s CPL in four types of disciplines by drawing their accumulative citation curves and calculating the descriptive statistical indexes , such as coefficient of variation ( CV ) , kurtosis and skewness . The last step focuses on time series analysis indicating the changes of CPL and rest percent ( the ratio of “rest” to “allYrs” ) . Our research firstly appli es citation lag to the categories level and to the macro area level , and regard CPL as a major indicator of knowledge diffusion speed . 3 . 3 Related characteristics In this paper , we mainly use several basic citation - related characteristics to reflect the situations of knowledge flow connecting LIS and other categories . Among these indicators , import citations , export citations , and cited / citing ratios are borrowed and developed from the research of Zhu et al . [ 49 ] . The details are as follows . 3 . 3 . 1 Import citations . For each year , import citations from a specific category to LIS is calculated as follows : 𝑖 𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 ( 𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝐶 𝑗𝑙 𝑛 𝑗 = 1 , where 𝐶 represents one of the 229 categories where LIS gains knowledge from , 𝐶 𝑗𝑙 is the citation frequency that journal 𝑗 in this category was cited by 𝑙 ( LIS ) , and 𝑛 is the number of journals belonged to the cited category . 3 . 3 . 2 Export citations . Similar to import citations , export citations from LIS to a specific category in one year is calculated as follows : 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 ( 𝑒 ) = ∑ 𝐶 𝑙𝑗 𝑚 𝑗 = 1 , where 𝐶 represents one of the 229 categories where LIS outputs knowledge to , and 𝐶 𝑙𝑗 is the citation frequency that 𝑙 ( LIS ) was cited by journal 𝑗 in this category , 𝑚 is the number of journals belonged to the citing category . 3 . 3 . 3 Cited / citing ratios . The cited / citing ratio for a categories pair comprised of LIS and certain category is calculated as follows : 𝑐𝑖𝑡 𝑒𝑑 / 𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 ( 𝑟 ) = ∑ 𝐶 𝑙𝑗 𝑚 𝑗 = 1 ∑ 𝐶 𝑗𝑙 𝑛 𝑗 = 1 , where 𝐶 𝑙𝑗 denotes export citations and 𝐶 𝑗𝑙 denotes import citations of LIS . 3 . 3 . 4 Citation Peak Lag ( CPL ) . Citation Peak Lag from LIS to one category 𝐶 , citing CPL of LIS is calculated as follows : 𝐶𝑃𝐿 = 𝑌 𝑜𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 − 𝑌 𝑚𝑎𝑥 , where 𝑌 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 represents the publication year of the articles to be observed , 𝑌 𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the year of highest citation frequency in , which means in the year 𝑌 𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 , most of articles that LIS cites come from year 𝑌 𝑚𝑎𝑥 . This formula also can be applied to reverse knowledge flow from category 𝐶 to LIS and obtain Cited CPL of LIS . In very few cases ( mainly due to insufficient citation accumulation ) , the maximum value of citation counts may appear in more than one year . For this situation , considering the fact that it’s more di fficult for new literatures to reach the same citation counts as the older ones , we regard the newer maximum year as 𝑌 𝑚𝑎𝑥 . Other characteristics , including coefficient of variation , kurtosis and skewness , are calculated according to the conventional formulas . 4 Results and discussion 4 . 1 An Overview of knowledge export , import and lag in LIS After performing the above steps , we can obtain the global view of knowledge flow of LIS . According to the statistics results of citation count ranking in each year , there are 40 categories that once presenting in top 20 cited or citing list of the LIS . Table 2 shows a part of the results ( The top 10 LIS - related categories on average ) , including mean value of all years’ citation count , CPL , ranks of export and import . We also calculated the five - year growth rates of them , from 2003 to 2008 , 2008 to 2013 , 2013 to 2018 .

The results demonstrate a growth trend of LIS in knowledge exchange . Besides LIS itself , Computer Science & Information Systems is the most closely related category to LIS , followed by Management , Computer Science & Interdisciplinary Applications and Business which are respectively derived from hard science and soft science , from which we can find the interdisciplinary property of LIS . In addition to the categories related to Computer Science and Management , Communication , Medical Informatics and Psychology also play major roles in knowledge flows . As for CPL , it turns out to be true that there will be some diversity in CPL of different categories . LIS has a relatively low CPL for itself , representing 2 . 56 years after published on average . The articles in LIS can feed back the current research most . However , we are surprised to find that the deviation between cited and citing CPL are varied in different categories . As Table 2 shows , LIS ’ s cited CPL of Computer Science & Information Systems ( IS ) is 3 . 31 years , while the citing CPL is 2 . 81 years , indicating that the speed of knowledge diffusion from IS to LIS is faster than that from LIS to IS . The similar situation exists in the subfields of Computer Science , such as Artificial Intelligence , Interdisciplinary Applications , and Medical Informatics . On the contrary , LIS ’ s citing CPL is higher than cited CPL in Business and Management , which demonstrates that the speed of knowledge diffusion from those areas to LIS are slower than the reverse . However , there is a balance between citing and cited CPL in some categories , such as Psychology and Communication . This may partially attribute to their subject and research characteristics : on the one hand , the research results of those categories have shorter utilization cycle ; on the other hand , LIS has various requirements and absorbed velocity for knowledge in different fields . 4 . 2 Export / import ratios of LIS Figure 1 shows the heatmap representing export / import ratio network of top 40 related categories in 15 years . The x - axis indicates the year and the y - axis indicates the category . Besides , based on the dimensions of the Biglan model , we also brought together the categories belonged to the same type , including SP , SA , HP and HA . In the heatmap , the darker the color of small square , the higher the value of export / import ratio . Export / import statistics of all years reveal that the input and output of LIS knowledge is basically in balance , because its population mean is 1 . 026 ( Among 40 categories ) . However , there are huge distribution differences in diverse categories . For each category , its momentum of knowledge surplus or deficit with LIS is usually continuous . For instance , as indicated in second row , LIS has a long - term knowledge trading deficit with Sociology , and the mean value of export / imports ratios is 0 . 30 , which suggests that only LIS cites Sociology three times can LIS be cited once . Environmental Sciences , by contrast , remains around 2 . 37 higher than LIS on export / imports ratio . It’s noteworthy that the color bar of Computer Science , Artificial Intelligence at the bottom changed from red to cyan , indicating that it reversed the dominant position of LIS in their relationship . The ratios also vary in different types of scientific fields . As shown through the distribution of red squa res in Fig . 1 , most of the LIS’s knowledge surplus categories , which are the main destinations of the largest share of knowledge trade , appear in hard science , especially hard and applied science ( HA ) . There are 18 categories’ ratios of Import to Export exceeds 1 , 15 of them pertaining to HA , including Environmental Sciences ( 2 . 369 ) , Telecommunications ( 1 . 201 ) , Ergonomics ( 1 . 891 ) , and several subfields of Computer Science . An emerging category , Green & Sustainable Science & Technology , contributes to the highest average of ratio ( 8 . 896 ) . These categories are usually more inclined to concrete topics , and they may tend to take advantages of the methods and tools within LIS to solve specific issues . However , the knowledge export surplus has reduced in hard and pure science ( HP ) , and generally , the export and import of HP are flat . Meanwhile , there exists more yellow and cyan blocks in soft science . 7 / 9 of soft and applied categories and the whole soft and pure categories are LIS’s knowledge deficit targets . So me related categories of LIS , such as Economics ( 0 . 183 ) , Psychology & Social ( 0 . 230 ) , Business ( 0 . 369 ) , Planning & Development ( 0 . 487 ) and so on , keep low value of export / import ratios over years and become salient knowledge exporters to LIS . As we can see , a large number of studies in LIS borrow and migrate the theoretical systems and research paradigms from soft science , but the impact of LIS on them remains relatively insignificant . Fig 1 : The export / import ratios heatmap of LIS and most relevant 40 categories in 15 years 4 . 3 Citation Peak Lag of LIS with related categories Figure 2 shows the distributed lines for normalized cited or citing counts for 5 LIS - related categories in two certain years , 2008 and 2018 . Except LIS itself , we select a typical category from each type of the Biglan model , and set the same distributed lines , which AP - L - 4 : Scholarly Knowledge - 2 JCDL ’20 , August 1 – 5 , 2020 , Virtual Event , China 201 represent the average cited and citing ratios of LIS in all years as the benchmark for every sub - graph ( the green and orange - red thin dotted lines ) . Besides , the solid lines in Figure 2 represent the distribution of LIS cited by the category , and the thick dashed lines represent the distribution of the category cited by LIS , while the pins mark the highest point and its value . The x - axis is the scale of the value of publication year , from 9 to 0 , and the y - axis ranges from 0 to 0 . 135 , but it has been fined tuned in the sub - graph of Biology for completeness . As we can see , these curves in Fig . 2 are like waves of knowledge flow . In the first sub - graph , for LIS itself , the cited line overlaps with citing lines , and their peaks come earlier than the average citation peaks . LIS’s CPL is 2 both in 2008 and 2018 , which means LIS’s knowledge generated 2 years ago has become the main reference source of current research . That’s faster than most knowledge in the same period . Fig 2 : line charts of the bi - directional knowledge waves between LIS and 5 typical categories The similar trend also exists in Computer Science & Information Systems . Their knowledge spread to LIS rapidly , but the cited CPL rose from 2 to 3 . Therefore , the speed of knowledge flow from LIS to other category may slightly drop . It is consistent with the previous analysis that Business , the typical representative of soft and applied science , has a larger CPL value than the average . Among SA , the cited CPL remains below the citing CPL , which indicates that LIS prefers to cite the time - tested articles in Business , while Business tends to use relatively fresh knowledge fruits of LIS . Diachronically , this state is more obvious in Psychology affiliated to Soft and Pure science ( SP ) and has subtle changes in recent years . Normally , in soft science , the citing peak of LIS lags far behind its cited peak . We speculate that soft science may generally pay more attention to instrumental knowledge of LIS . Besides , the general pattern of the type , Hard and Pure science ( HP ) , can be characterized by the quick bi - directional knowledge flow . As shown in Biology , the export and import knowledge are both rapid and intensive , and there is a low probability for them to utiliz e other’s sedimentary literatures or classical theories . Furthermore , when we compared the soft science with hard science vertically , we found that the former usually possess milder knowledge waves , particularly when LIS cites soft science , which means in a certain year , the time distribution of LIS citations from soft science are more homogeneous . AP - L - 4 : Scholarly Knowledge - 2 JCDL ’20 , August 1 – 5 , 2020 , Virtual Event , China 202 Although the waves of hard science are often more acute and unbalanced , their citations tend to cluster in one or two specific years . 4 . 4 Knowledge waves of LIS in 4 types of the Biglan model In order to examine the details and regular pattern of LIS’s CPL in difference types of categories , we regard each row of our dataset shown in Table 1 as an array , and then introduce some descriptive statistical indicators , including frequency , CPL , coefficient of variation ( CV ) , Kurtosis , Skewness and Export / Import ratio , to quantify their respective features ( noted that skewness and kurtosis were calculated on the base x - axis of Fig . 2 ) . To expand the sample size , in this section , we collect the 53 categories ( Except LIS itself ) , some of which were once contained in citing or cited top 30 of LIS in the past 15 years . Among them , 26 categories belong to HA , 9 belong to HP , 11 belong to SA , 7 belong to SP . Table 3 serves as a summary table to these statistical results . In regards to citation frequency , LIS’s articles are mostly cited or citing by the categories from SA , and the citation count of SA is close to the sum of other types . This proves that LIS is closely connected with humanities and social science . In combination with Export / Import ratio , we find that only in HA , LIS’s cited frequency is higher than LIS’s citing frequency and the average ratio reaches a unique positive value ( 1 . 654 ) , indicating that a substantial part of HA’s categories run a know ledge deficit with LIS . However , other 3 types’ categories generally show knowledge surplus to LIS , and the SP is most prominent . As for CPL , the maximal LIS cited CPL comes from SP ( 4 . 292 years ) , and the minimal from HP ( 3 . 851 years ) , whereas the highest CPL of LIS citing comes from SA ( 5 . 092 years ) and lowest from HP ( 3 . 657 years ) . No matter which direction of knowledge flow is , CPL of soft science is usually longer than that of hard science . In general , LIS absorbs knowledge slightly slower than it outputs knowledge . And LIS’s cited CPL of soft science is markedly shorter than its citing CPL , while in HP , the situation is opposite , and in HA , the difference between cited CPL and citing CPL is not obvious . Besides , the change of the average citing CPL is more stable than cited CPL based on our statistics . The similarity of average CV shows that the degree of data dispersion of each sample is similar in our dataset . Thus , we adopted the Kurtosis and Skewness to measure and identify the curve trend of each row . According to Kurtosis and Skewness , the situation of different types is basically in line with that of the representative categories of LIS mentioned in section 4 . 3 . The overall view of Kurtosis suggests that the knowledge waves of hard science are more likely to achieve a higher peak of citation accumulation , especially the knowledge flowing out of LIS , and the citations to HP are more inclined to concentrate on certain years . As for Skewness , it demonstrates the extent of asymmetry of data distribution . Only SP’s average citing skewness is positive ( 0 . 027 ) , which is corresponding to positive skew , but the average citing skewness of SA ( - 0 . 004 ) is close to 0 , which denotes the significant trend of lagging peak , and the skewness of hard science are identified as negative skew . Similar situation also exists in cited skewness . Take citing skewness as an example . As shown in Fig . 3 , it is clear that the citing skewness values of LIS gradually converge and stabilize , and zero acts as a dividing line between soft science and hard science on the whole , which reveals the exactly opposite lagging trend . But the majority of citing citation distributions have long tails on their left at present . Fig . 4 shows the slight growth trend of rest percent ( the ratios of citations from articles published ten years ago to total citations ) . Besides , the ratios of hard science are significantly lower than those of soft science , indicating that LIS cites more articles from ten years ago in soft science than in hard science , which can be proved by the greater distributed deviation of hard science . Based on the view of the references of all years rather than last ten years , we find that there are relatively more citations distributed in the stage of long tails after citation peak in the categories of pure science than that of applied science . However , it’s worth noting that these real data don’t strictly fit the normal distribution , thus we just tentatively use these indicators to probe into their states and changes of knowledge waves .

Citation is one of the most effective tools to observe and characterize knowledge trade , and citation lag are also recognized as a common diffusion phenomenon . However , most of previous work mainly focused on articles , lacking consideration of disciplines . We find that unlike citation lag in single paper , Citation Peak Lag is more essential at the category level . By accumulating the citations of papers between two categories in one year , we can calculate both cited and citing Citation Peak Lag ( CPL ) in bidirectional knowledge flows . CPL can not only be used to measure and investigate the speed of knowledge diffusion in certain category , but can also be used to compare and quanti fy a category’s relationship with other different fields from a new viewpoint . This makes CPL a very valuable parameter that can help us to set up a comprehensive framework to understand interdisciplinary knowledge exchange . In this paper , we select LIS , which made great efforts to expand its interdisciplinary intellectual impact [ 50 ] , as our research object , and analyze its status in knowledge export and import , including its destinations of knowledge flow and corresponding CPL . Based on our discussion and results , there are four clear conclusions : 1 . LIS is highly interdisciplinary . LIS has some steady knowledge trade destinations , which include soft science such as Business and Management , Psychology , Communication , as well as hard science such as Computer Science and so on . The knowledge surplus of LIS mostly appears in hard and applied science , while the trading deficits of LIS are centralized in soft science . 2 . In the major knowledge flows related to LIS , citing CPL and cited CPL display different scenes . In most of hard science , such as Computer Science , their cited CPL of LIS is less than or roughly equal to their citing CPL of LIS , indicating that the knowledge export velocity of LIS is slower than its import velocity . However , in soft science , including Business and Management , cited CPL of LIS is evidently shorter than its citing CPL . 3 . In general , LIS’s citing CPL is a little longer than its cited CPL , which suggests that LIS exports knowledge slightly faster than imports knowledge . And LIS’s CPL is higher in categories of soft science and lower in hard science , showing that the knowledge flows between LIS and hard science carry newer information than that between LIS and soft science in the same period . Beside s , on the average , HP’s CPL is shorter than HA’s , but there are some subtle differences between SP and SA . 4 . The distinction of knowledge waves from different types’ categories not only reflect in CPL , but also reflect in the data distribution . Based on the results of kurtosis and skewness , we speculate that hard science not only tends to achieve higher citation peak , but also can achieve that more rapidly . Also , the citation of hard science tends to focus on certain years . In contrast , the soft or pure science tends to have more severe negative skew distribution and longer left long tails . Our research introduces a unique and effective indicator , citation peak lag ( CPL ) , which can reflect the velocity of knowledge diffusion . Based on the dataset of LIS from JCR , we find out that the more citation data accumulated , the more accurate the CPL is . However , the findings of our work are limited to one research domain , LIS . Thus , we intend to introduce broader data sources and aggregate citation data at a higher level , and utilize CPL to analyze the trends of knowledge exchange between different disciplines . In addition , we find that there might be some correlations between CPL and other metrics , such as Half - Life , which are worthy of further validation and research .
