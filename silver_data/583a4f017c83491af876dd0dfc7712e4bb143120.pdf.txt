Grill , 3 , 1 † Carl - Philipp Heisenberg 2 † Contractile actomyosin rings drive various fundamental morphogenetic processes ranging from cytokinesis to wound healing . Actomyosin rings are generally thought to function by circumferential contraction . Here , we show that the spreading of the enveloping cell layer ( EVL ) over the yolk cell during zebrafish gastrulation is driven by a contractile actomyosin ring . In contrast to previous suggestions , we find that this ring functions not only by circumferential contraction but also by a flow - friction mechanism . This generates a pulling force through resistance against retrograde actomyosin flow . EVL spreading proceeds normally in situations where circumferential contraction is unproductive , indicating that the flow - friction mechanism is sufficient . Thus , actomyosin rings can function in epithelial morphogenesis through a combination of cable - constriction and flow - friction mechanisms . I n zebrafish epiboly , the enveloping cell layer ( EVL ) surface epithelium formed at the ani - mal pole of the gastrula ( 1 ) spreads over the entire yolk cell to completely engulf it at the end ofgastrulation . EVLmovements are independent of epiboly movements of the deep cells below ( 2 ) , but require contact between the EVL and the yolk syncytial layer ( YSL ) to which the EVL is connectedatitsmargin ( 3 , 4 ) . Contractileactomyosin rings drive many fundamental morphogeneticpro - cesses ( 5 – 9 ) , and it has been proposed that in zebrafish a contractile actomyosin ring within the YSL , a thin cytoplasmic layer at the surface of the yolk cell , drives EVL epiboly by pulling on the edge of the EVL ( 4 , 10 , 11 ) . However , the force - generating mechanisms by which this ring drives EVL epiboly movements remain elusive . To investigate the physical mechanisms driv - ing EVL epiboly , we first examined the global distribution of actin and myosin - 2 within the embryo ( movies S1 and S2 ) . Just after the onset of epiboly , when the EVL covers 40 % of the spherical yolk cell ( 40 % epiboly ; 5 hours post - fertilization , hpf ) , we observed an accumulation of both actin and myosin - 2 within the YSL in a band - like structure close to the margin of the EVL ( Fig . 1A ) . This initially broad actomyosin band ( 85 . 8 T 11 . 8 m m ; errors denote error of the mean at 95 % confidence unless noted otherwise ) decreases its width during EVL epiboly pro - gression , eventually forming a tight circumfer - ential ring - like structure ( 32 . 2 T 3 . 5 m m ) at 70 to 80 % epiboly ( 7 . 5 to 8 . 5 hpf ; Fig . 1 , A to C ) . We then asked if the YSL actomyosin ring drives EVL epiboly movements . Previous studies on the function of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway components traf2 / nika ( 4 ) and mapkapk2 ( 11 ) suggested that actomyo - sin contractility within the YSL affects EVL epib - oly movements . To directly test whether YSL actomyosin contractility drives EVL epiboly , we locally disrupted the YSL actomyosin ring close to the EVL margin in 60 % epiboly - stage em - bryos ( 6 . 5 hpf ) with an ultraviolet ( UV ) laser cutter ( 12 ) . This caused considerable delays in epiboly movements of the EVL margin directly adjacent to the ablation site ( Fig . 1 , D to F , and movie S3 ) , suggesting that the YSL actomyosin ring is required for EVL epiboly movements and that its functional requirement is locally restricted . We next sought to understand how YSL ac - tomyosin ring contractility drives EVL epiboly movements . One possibility is that the ring ac - tively generates tension along its circumference , which due to the spherical geometry of the em - bryo gives rise to a force pulling on the EVL margin ( supplementary material ) . To test for the presence of circumferential tension within the YSL actomyosin ring , we used a UV laser cutter ( 12 ) to sever the actomyosin network along a 20 - m m - long line 20 m m away from the EVL / YSL border in an orientation perpendicular to the EVL margin ( Fig . 2A and movie S4 ) . Perpendicular cuts resulted in rapid recoil velocities of the ac - tomyosin network at 60 to 70 % epiboly that de - cayed exponentially over time ( 12 ) ( 6 . 5 to 7 . 5 hpf ; v cut = 19 . 1 T 1 . 5 m m / s , t = 1 . 7 T 0 . 2 s , N = 40 ; fig .

Because of the spherical geometry of the yolk cell , circumferential active tension will result in a net force pulling on the EVL margin , which is zero when the ring is at the equator and grows as the ring approaches the pole ( Fig . 3A and sup - plementary material ) . Consequently , when the ring is near the equator , tension in the animal - vegetal ( AV ) direction within the ring is expected to be much smaller than circumferential tension ( supplementary material ) . A detailed calculation that considers the force balance of a constricting ring positioned on a sphere and connected to the EVL at one end shows that AV tension scales as h / R cot q , with q being the polar angle , h the width of the ring , and R the radius of the yolk cell . As a result , AV tension is expected to increase during epiboly progression and reach at most ~ 20 % of circumferential tension at 80 % epiboly ( supple - mentary material ) . We tested this assumption by cutting the actomyosin network along a 20 - m m - long line 20 m m away from the EVL / YSL border inanorientationparalleltotheEVL margin ( Fig . 2A and movie S5 ) . Contrary to our expectations , we found that the initial recoil velocity of the acto - myosin network for parallel cuts was approximate - lyhalfoftheinitialrecoilvelocityforperpendicularcutsat60to70 % epiboly ( v cut = 7 . 5 T 1 . 0 m m / s , N = 40 ) and remained constant during epiboly pro - gression ( fig . S2D and Fig . 2B ) . Notably , char - acteristic decay times were similar for both parallel and perpendicular cuts and at different stages dur - ing epiboly ( fig . S2 , B to E ) , suggesting that ma - terial properties of the actomyosin network are constant and isotropic . We conclude that AV ten - sion is much larger than expected if the actomy - osin ring were acting as a constricting ring only . To elucidate where the additional tension in the AV direction comes from , we analyzed the dynamicdistributionofactinandmyosin - 2within the YSL at high spatial and temporal resolution using spinning disk confocal microscopy . Forma - tion of the actomyosin ring was accompanied by flows of actin and myosin - 2 from vegetal parts of the YSL toward the margin of the EVL ( Fig . 2C and movie S8 ) . These retrograde actomyosinflows were slow ( 0 . 3 m m / min ) at the onset of EVL epiboly ( 40 % epiboly ) , but increased their retro - grade velocity as epiboly proceeded , reaching maximal flow velocities of 1 . 2 m m / min around 70 % epiboly stage ( Fig . 2D and fig . S3 ) . To investigate if retrograde flows within the YSL could give rise to additional tension along the AVaxis of the YSL actomyosin network , we developed a theoretical description of YSL acto - myosin network dynamics within the framework of thin films of active fluids ( 12 – 14 ) ( supplemen - tary material ) . Cortical flows have previously been associated with gradients of actomyosin contrac - tility along the direction of flow ( 12 , 15 ) . We considered the actomyosin ring to be an isotropic thin - film fluid with myosin - 2 – dependent active tension ( Fig . 3 and supplementary material ) . The animal side of the ring is mechanically connected to the EVL ( 4 ) , and tension and velocity are con - tinuous at the interface between the two layers ( Fig . 3A ) . On the vegetal side of the ring , myosin - 2 density , and consequently active tension , grad - ually decreases toward zero , consistent with tension measurements at the vegetal pole ( fig . S2F and movie S9 ) . This active tension gradient can give rise to contractile flow ( Fig . 3 and supplementary material ) . The ring here is in a “ stationary state , ” where flow within the ring is compensated and balanced by continuous actomyosin turnover and regrowth ( fig . S5 ) , reminiscent of situations in crawling cells where retrograde actin flow is compensated by continuous polymerization at the leading edge ( 16 ) . Turnover also endows the ma - terial with fluid character ( 12 , 17 ) . Applying this model to EVL epiboly , we re - vealed two contributions to the total force exerted by the ring upon the EVL — one from circumfer - ential tension coupling to geometry , and one from flow . In the absence of friction between the acto - myosin ring and adjacent components of the yolk cell , total force on the EVL arises solely through a ring - contraction mechanism that couples to the spherical geometry of the yolk cell ( termed “ cable - constriction motor ” ; Fig . 3A ) . Notably , this cable - constriction motor can drive epiboly only once the actomyosin ring has passed the equator ( Fig . 3A and fig . S11 ) .

In the embryo , friction will arise when the flow velocity in the ring is different from the velocity of the adjacent material , such as the yolk cell plasma membrane and the yolk cytoplasm . Con - sistent with this , we observed differential flow ve - locities between the actomyosin in the ring and adjacent microtubules within the YSL ( fig . S6 ) . This flow - friction motor pulls the EVL in a di - rection opposite to the actomyosin flow , operates at any stage , and can drive epiboly before passing theequator ( Fig . 3Aandfig . S11 ) . Notably , friction - resisted flow provides additional tension in the AV direction , consistent with the small degree of tension anisotropy observed in the laser ablation experiments ( Fig . 2B ) . Furthermore , experimentally measured flow profiles within the EVL and the ac - tomyosin ring , as well as the relative tensions ob - tained from laser ablation , are accurately predicted by our theoretical description at all stages when friction against the substrate is taken into account ( Fig . 3B ) . To conclude , we identified two distinct modes of ring propulsion : a cable - constriction mo - tor due to circumferential contraction of the YSL actomyosin network , and aflow - friction motor due to contraction along the AVaxis of the network . We next asked if the flow - friction motor is sufficient to drive EVL epiboly . To this end , we took advantage of the predicted geometry depen - dence of the cable - constriction motor . Because the cable - constriction motor cannot exert a net force on the EVL when positioned right at the equator , propulsion by this motor would be hin - dered when the yolk cell is deformed from its orig - inal spherical geometry into a cylindrical shape . We thus deformed the yolk cell into a cylindrical shape by aspirating pre – gastrula - stage embryos ( 2 . 5 hpf ) into agarose tubes of a diameter smaller than that of the embryo and analyzed resulting changes in EVL movements . To verify that the actomyosin ring is unperturbed in cylindrical em - bryos , we analyzed the distribution and flow of actin and myosin - 2 within the YSL of cylindrical embryos . We found that both the accumulation of actin and myosin - 2 in a ring - like structure adja - cent to the EVL / YSL border and their retrograde flows from the vegetal pole toward the EVL / YSL border were largely unaffected in cylindrical em - bryos as compared to normal - shaped control em - bryos ( Fig . 4 and movie S10 ) . This suggests that the actomyosin ring remains intact in cylindrical embryos . We observed that EVL movementswere largely unaffected in cylindrical embryos and pro - ceeded with velocities similar to those of spherical control embryos ( 2 . 0 T 0 . 2 m m / min compared to 1 . 9 T 0 . 1 m m / min at 60 to 70 % epiboly ; compare Figs . 4D and 2D ) . This shows that the cable - constriction motor is not essential for EVL epiboly movements and indicates that the flow - friction motor is sufficient to drive this process . Our findings have major implications for the function of actomyosin rings in morphogenesis . Whereas the prevalent model of actomyosin ring function assumes circumferential contraction as the main force - generating process , we present evidence that friction - resisted actomyosin flows can represent an equally important process me - diating ring function . This raises the possibility of a more general role of cortical flows in morpho - genetic pattern formation processes ( 18 ) . References and Notes 1 . S . E . Lepage , A . E . E . Bruce , Int . J .

Hardie * and Kristian Franze Phototransduction in Drosophila microvillar photoreceptor cells is mediated by a G protein – activated phospholipase C ( PLC ) . PLC hydrolyzes the minor membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , leading by an unknown mechanism to activation of the prototypical transient receptor potential ( TRP ) and TRP - like ( TRPL ) channels . We found that light exposure evoked rapid PLC - mediated contractions of the photoreceptor cells and modulated the activity of mechanosensitive channels introduced into photoreceptor cells . Furthermore , photoreceptor light responses were facilitated by membrane stretch and were inhibited by amphipaths , which alter lipid bilayer properties . These results indicate that , by cleaving PIP 2 , PLC generates rapid physical changes in the lipid bilayer that lead to contractions of the microvilli , and suggest that the resultant mechanical forces contribute to gating the light - sensitive channels . I n most invertebrate photoreceptor cells , the visual pigment ( rhodopsin ) and other compo - nents of the phototransduction cascade are localized within tightly packed microvilli ( tubu - lar membranous protrusions ) , together forming a light - guiding rod - like stack ( rhabdomere ; Fig . 1 ) . After photoisomerization , rhodopsin activates a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide – binding protein ( Gq protein ) , releasing its guanosine triphosphate – bound a subunit , which in turn activates phos - pholipase C ( PLC ; Fig . 1C ) . How PLC activity leads to gating of the light - sensitive transient re - ceptor potential channels ( TRP and TRPL ) in the microvilli is unresolved ( 1 – 3 ) . PLC hydrolyzes the minor membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , yielding soluble inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( InsP 3 ) , diacylglycerol ( DAG , which remains in the inner leaflet of the micro - villarlipidbilayer ) , andaproton . Thelight - sensitive channels in Drosophila photoreceptors can be activated by a combination of PIP 2 depletion and protons ( 4 ) , but it remains unclear how PIP 2 de - pletion might contribute to channel gating . It has been speculated that changes in membrane prop - erties play a role ( 4 , 5 ) , and members of the TRP ion channel family have been repeatedly , although controversially , implicated as mechanosensitive channels ( 6 , 7 ) . This led us to ask whether cleav - age of the bulky , charged inositol head group of PIP 2 ( Fig . 1C ) from the inner leaflet might alter the physical properties of the lipid bilayer in the microvilli , resulting in mechanical forces that con - tribute to channel gating . Remarkably , Drosophila photoreceptors re - sponded to light flashes with small ( < 1 m m ) but rapid contractions that were directly visible in Department of Physiology , Development and Neuroscience , University of Cambridge , Cambridge CB2 3EG , UK . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .
