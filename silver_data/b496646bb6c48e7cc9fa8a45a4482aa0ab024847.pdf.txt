Characterization of a Novel Cofilin Isoform That Is Predominantly Expressed in Mammalian Skeletal Muscle * ( Received for publication , October 1 , 1993 , and in revised form , January 10 , 1994 ) Shoichiro OnoSQ , Narihiro Minamis , Hiroshi AbeQ , and Takashi Obinatasn From the $ Graduate School of Science and Technology and $ Department of Biology , Faculty of Science , Chiba University , Yayoi - cho , Inage - ku , Chiba 263 , Japan Cofilin is an actin - modulating protein of 20 kDa , which is widely distributed throughout muscle and non - muscle cells . By means of immunoblotting combined with two - dimensional gel electrophoresis , we found that two cofilin variants , muscle type ( " type ) and non - muscle type ( NM - type ) , exist in mammals , while a single isoform exists in chickens . During in vitro myogenesis of mouse C2 cells , expression of the " type cofilin was up - regulated . To better understand the nature of the " type cofilin , we cloned cDNAs encoding " type cofilin from the cDNA library of C2 myotubes and determined the entire sequence . The deduced peptide sequence con - tained a nuclear localization signal and a putative actin - binding sequence as reported in NM - type cofilin . The sequence showed 81 % identity in the amino acid resi - dues with the mouse NM - type cofilin sequence and , in - terestingly , higher homology ( 96 % identity ) with that of chicken cofilin . The mRNA encoding " type cofilin , though it contains two variants that differ in the size of their 3 ' - non - coding sequences , was detected predomi - nantly in heart , skeletal muscle , C2 myotubes , and testis by Northern blotting , while the mRNA for NM - type cofi - lin was seen in a variety of non - muscle tissues . The pres - ence of the muscle type isoform of cofilin strongly sug gests that cofilin is deeply involved in the regulation of actin function not only in non - muscle cells but also in muscle cells . The assembly and disassembly of actin in living cells are under the control of a variety of actin - binding proteins ( for review see Pollard and Cooper ( 1986 ) and Way and Weeds ( 1990 ) . During the development of vertebrate striated muscles , actin assembles into thin filaments of myofibrils . Actin - binding proteins , which regulate actin assembly during myofibrillogen - esis , have been detected in embryonic chicken skeletal muscle ( Obinata , 1993 ) ; they are identified with profilin ( Ohshima et al . , 19891 , actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) ' ( Abe and Obi - Ministry of Education , Science and Culture of Japan , the National * This research was supported in part by research grants from the Center of Neurology and Psychiatry ( PCNP ) of the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan , the Yamada Science Foundation , the Uehara Memorial Foundation , and the Futaba Denshi Memorial Foundation .

Cofilin is an actin - binding protein of 20 kDa , which modu - lates actin assembly in vitro in a pH - dependent manner ( Yon - ezawa et al . , 19851 , inhibits binding of tropomyosin to F - actin ( Nishida et al . , 19841 , and inhibits an actin - myosin interaction ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ) . Cofilin was originally discovered in por - cine brain ( Maekawa et al . , 1984 ; Nishida et al . , 1984 ) as an actin monomer - binding protein , and then its distribution among mammalian tissues and cultured cells was examined by immunoblotting ( Yonezawa et al . , 1987 ) and Northern blotting ( Moriyama et al . , 1990a ) . These studies have revealed that cofilin is present in a wide variety of mammalian non - muscle tissues and cultured cells but that it scarcely exists in skeletal muscle . It was observed , however , that cofilin is enriched in chicken embryonic skeletal muscle ( Abe et al . , 1989 ) , and unlike in mammalian tissues , the expression of cofilin persists through development of chicken skeletal muscle , even in adults ( Hay - akawa et al . , 1993 ; Obinata and Abe , 1991 ) . In addition , re - cently we observed that the expression of cofilin is up - regulated in denervated chicken ( Shinagawa et al . , 1993 ) or dystrophic chicken and mouse skeletal muscle ( Hayakawa et al . , 1993 ) . Since these muscles are in the process of gradual degeneration , it is also likely that cofilin is involved in the redistribution of actin during disassembly of myofibrils . The sequences of cDNAs encoding cofilin have been deter - mined in porcine brain ( Matsuzaki et al . , 19881 , mouse brain ( Moriyama et al . , 1990b ) , human placenta ( Ogawa et al . , 19901 , and chicken embryonic skeletal muscle ( Abe et al . , 1990 ) . Their deduced amino acid sequences are highly conserved ( 99 % iden - tical between mammalian cofilins and 81 % between mamma - lian and chicken cofilin ) . In the sequences of cofilin , several characteristic sequences are conserved , including a nuclear lo - calization signal ( Abe et al . , 1993 ; Iida et al . , 19921 , which is involved in nuclear localization of cofilin in response to heat , shock , or exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide ( Nishida et al . , 19871 , an actin and phosphoinositide - binding sequence ( Moriyama et al . , 1992 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1991a , 1991b ) , and the sequence that is homologous to the amino - terminal sequence of tropomyosin ( Yonezawa et al . , 1989 ) . Interestingly , the sequence of cofilin displays a striking ho - mology with that of ADF from chicken brain ( Adams et al . , 1990 ) and skeletal muscle ( Abe et al . , 1990 ) and that of destrin from porcine brain ( Moriyama et al . , 1990a ) , both of which are functionally somewhat distinct from cofilin . ADF / destrin binds to G - actin at a 1 : l molar ratio and causes rapid depolymeriza - tion of F - actin ( Abe and Obinata , 1989 ; Bamburg et al . , 1980 ; Nishida et al . , 1985 ) . The expression and distribution of ADFI destrin among tissues also differ from those of cofilin ( Bamburg and Bray , 1987 ; Hayakawa et al . , 1993 ; Moriyama et al . , 1990a ) . Especially , in chicken skeletal muscle , the expression of ADF decreases during development and becomes scarcely de - 15280 Mammalian Muscle - type Cofilin 15281 tectable in adults ( Bamburg and Bray , 1987 ; Hayakawa et al . , 1993 ) . In addition , the activity of ADF is modulated by in - creased phosphorylation ofADF during myogenesis ( Morgan et al . , 1993 ) . In the present study , by means of immunoblotting combined with two - dimensional electrophoresis , we found that two cofilin variants , M - type and NM - type cofilin , exist in mammals , while a single isoform exists in chickens . Since the previously de - scribed cDNAs for mammalian cofilins were cloned from non - muscle tissues , it is likely that all of them would encode NM - type cofilin . To understand the structure and function of M - type cofilin , we cloned cDNAs encoding M - type cofilin from a cDNA library of C2 myotubes and determined the complete sequence . The deduced amino acid sequence was distinct from the previ - ously described cofilin sequence . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Cultures - Rat fibroblast cells ( 3Y1 ) , mouse fibroblast cells ( Balb 3T3 ) , mouse skeletal muscle cells ( C2 ) , and rat smooth muscle cells derived from embryonic thoracic aorta ( A10 ) were grown in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ( Life Technologies , Inc . ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and 60 pg / ml kanamycin . To initiate the differen - tiation of C2 myoblast cells into myotubes , the cultures at about 50 % confluence were transferred to Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium supplemented with 5 % horse serum and maintained for 6 days at semi - confluence . Mouse myeloma cells ( P3U1 ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 ( Nissui , Tokyo ) supplemented with 15 % fetal calf serum . Gel Electrophoresis and Immunohlotting - Two - dimensional PAGE was performed by a combination of nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis in the first dimension ( O ' Farrell et al . , 1977 ) and SDS - PAGE in the second dimension using 13 . 5 % polyacrylamide gel in a discontinuous Tris - glycine buffer system ( Laemmli , 1970 ) except that the system was miniaturized as described by Mikawa et al . ( 1981 ) . Proteins were electrophoretically transferred from SDS - polyacrylamide gel to nitrocellulose paper by the method of Towbin et al . ( 1979 ) . The paper was treated with 3 % gelatin and incubated for 1 h with the monoclonal antibody to cofilin ( " 22 ) ( Abe et al . , 1989 ) , followed by treatment with peroxidase - labeled goat anti - mouse IgG for 1 h . After the immunoreaction , the paper was washed with 0 . 5 M NaCI , 10 mM Tris - HCI , pH 7 . 5 . Peroxidase - labeled goat anti - mouse IgG bound to the paper was detected as the diaminobenzidine reaction product with nickel and cobalt ions ( De Blas and Chenvinski , 1983 ) . Amplification of cDNA hy Polymerase Chain Reaction fPCR ) - Poly ( AY RNA from C2 myotubes was prepared by oligo ( dT ) - cellulose column chromatography of total RNA isolated by the rapid one - step method ( Chomczynski and Sacchi , 1987 ) . To obtain cDNA for mouse M - type cofilin , the first strand of cDNA was synthesized from poly ( AF RNA primed with an antisense primer , 5 ' 4GGATCCTTTATAA - GGG ' " Y ! CTTCAAG ) , corresponding to the sequence containing the stop codon of chicken cofilin ( Abe et al . , 1990 ) and an additional BamHI site ( underlined ) . The cDNA was then amplified by PCR using the antisense primer and a sense primer , 5 ' 4GCGCCATGGCTTCTG - GAGT ) , corresponding to the sequence containing the initiation codon of chicken cofilin . Reaction parameters were 1 min at 94 " C , 2 min at 40 " C , and 3 min at 72 " C for 25 cycles . The PCR product of 500 base pairs was recovered with agarose gel electrophoresis and then cloned into pBluescript 11 - KS ' and sequenced by the dideoxy method ( Sanger et al . , 1977 ) . This obtained clone was designated as pMMC - 4P . cDNA encoding mouse NM - type cofilin was obtained by PCR as de - scribed above using 5 ' - ( AAC * CATGGCCTCTGGTGTGGCTG TCTCTG ) as a sense primer and 5 ' 4GGATCCGGTGGCTCACAAAGGCTTGC - CCTC ) as an antisense primer corresponding to the sequence contain - ing the initiation codon and the stop codon of mouse brain cofilin ( Moriyama et al . , 1990b ) , respectively . The asterisk denotes the alter - ation from A of the original sequence to make the NcoI site , and the underlined sequence denotes an additional BamHI site . Amplified cDNA was cloned into pBluescript 11 - KS ' , and the sequence was con - firmed to be the same as that of mouse brain cofilin ( Moriyama et al . , 1990b ) . Construction and Screening of cDNA Library - Poly ( AY RNA was prepared from C2 myotubes by the method described above . The cDNA synthesis was performed with a Superscript Lambda System ( Life Technologies , Inc . ) . Briefly , cDNA was synthesized from the poly ( AY RNA using an oligo ( dT ) primer , ligated into a hgt22A vector , and then packaged in vitro with Gigapack I1 packaging extract ( Stratagene , La b c . 4 4 ) . d 4 . . 4 FIG . 1 .

DNA Sequencing - The cDNA inserts of positive phage clones were subcloned into pBluescript 11 - KS + . The unidirectional deletions of the cDNA were made by using exonuclease 111 and mung bean nuclease , and several restriction fragments of the full - length cDNA ( pMMC - 3 ) were subcloned into pBluescript 11 - KS ' for DNA sequencing . The nucle - otide sequence was determined by the dideoxy method ( Sanger et al . , 1977 ) . Northern Blotting - Total RNA was prepared as mentioned above ( Chomczynski and Saachi , 1987 ) . 10 pg of RNA for each lane was sepa - rated on l % agarose - formaldehyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters , which were then baked for 2 h at 80 " C . Hybridization was performed by the procedure of Thomas ( 1980 ) , with probes labeled with ? ? P by the method of Feinberg and Vogelstein ( 1983 ) . The filters were finally washed in 2 x SSC ( 1 x SSC = 150 mM NaC1 , 25 mM trisodium citrate ) , 0 . 1 % SDS at 55 " C . Southern Blotting - Chromosomal DNA from mouse liver was pre - pared as described by Blin and Stafford ( 1976 ) , and 20 pg of DNA was digested by EcoRI , PstI , HindIII , and KpnI , electrophoresed on 0 . 7 % agarose gel , and then transferred to nitrocellulose filters . Hybridization was performed as described under " Northern Blotting . " The filters were finally washed in 0 . 1 x SSC , 0 . 2 % SDS at 65 " C for M - type cofilin or in 0 . 1 x SSC , 0 . 5 % SDS at 68 " C for NM - type cofilin because of the ap - pearance of some additional bands . RESULTS Avian and Mammalian Cofilin Analyzed by no - dimensional , Gel Electrophoresis - When chicken embryonic skeletal muscle , brain , and gizzard smooth muscle were examined by immuno - blotting combined with two - dimensional gel electrophoresis , one major spot and one minor spot of cofilin were detected by MAB - 22 ( Fig . 1 , a + ) . To compare these spots , the lysates of brain and skeletal muscle were mixed and then subjected to two - dimensional PAGE . As shown in Fig . 1 , d and e , the spots of cofilin from the different tissues co - migrated exactly . The same results were obtained with the other tissues . Our previ - ous study revealed that the minor spot of cofilin on the acidic side ( arrowheads ) can be generated by phosphorylation of the major cofilin spot ( Abe et al . , 1993 ) . Therefore , we conclude that a single cofilin isoform exists among chicken muscle and non - muscle tissues . However , in mouse tissues , two kinds of cofilins were distin - guished by two - dimensional PAGE . As shown in Fig . 2 , a and b , one major spot of cofilin was detected by MAB - 22 in both brain 15282 Mammalian Muscle - type Cofilin H + - nu - a - “I , b + 4 - ? 4 - H + - OH - a 4 ” FIG . 2 . Two cofilin variants in mouse tissues distinguished by two - dimensional PAGE . Whole lysates of mouse skeletal muscle ( a ) and brain ( 6 ) were electrophoresed on two - dimensional gel , and then cofilin was detected by means of immunoblotting with MAB - 22 . To compare the location of the cofilin spots from mouse muscle and brain , the lysates of chicken skeletal muscle and mouse skeletal muscle ( c ) or mouse brain ( d ) were mixed and then subjected to two - dimensional PAGE followed by immunoblotting with MAB - 22 . Arrowheads indicate “type cofilin spots and arrows the spots that may correspond to the phosphorylated form of cofilin . and skeletal muscle . When the extract from chicken skeletal muscle ( as shown in Fig . la ) was added to the mouse skeletal muscle extract , the major cofilin spots from the two muscles co - migrated on the two - dimensional gel ( Fig . 2c ) . In the case of the mixture of chicken muscle and mouse brain , however , two major cofilin spots were clearly distinguished by the difference in PI ( Fig . 2d ) ; the spot with more acidic PI was derived from muscle and the other was from brain . These results indicate that the cofilins from mouse skeletal muscle and brain have different PI values . Phosphorylated forms of cofilin ( marked by arrows ) appeared on the acidic side of the major spots , although small in amount , as reported by Ohta et al . ( 1989 ) . It seemed likely that the two cofilin spots in mammals corresponded to isoforms with different primary structures . The cofilin in brain was designated as “non - muscle ( NM - ) type” and that in skeletal muscle as “muscle ( M - ) type . ” We examined further the types of cofilin expressed in homo - geneous muscle and non - muscle cells in culture , namely a mouse skeletal muscle cell line ( C2 ) and a mouse fibroblast cell line ( Balb 3T3 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . In the 3T3 cells , the NM - type cofilin was dominantly detected by “22 , although a considerable amount of it was phosphorylated ( arrow in Fig . 3a ) ( Ohta et al . , 1989 ) . The M - type cofilin was detected only in a small amount . The electrophoresis pattern of cofilin from mononucleated C2 myoblasts at a growing phase before differentiation was almost the same as that from the fibroblasts ( Fig . 3b ) . However , in the multinucleated C2 myotubes after differentiation , the expres - sion of the M - type cofilin increased and that of the NM - type cofilin decreased ( Fig . 3c ) . These results show that the conver - sion of cofilin isoform from the NM - to the M - type occurs during myogenesis . Cloning and Sequencing of Mouse M - type Cofilin cDNA - The sequences of cDNA clones encoding mammalian cofilin from porcine brain ( Matsuzaki et al . , 19881 , mouse brain ( Moriyama et al . , 1990b ) , and human placenta ( Ogawa et al . , 1990 ) have been reported , but they may be regarded as NM - type cofilin cDNA because they are derived from non - muscle tissues and their respective deduced amino acid sequences are about 99 % identical . In order to better understand the nature of the mam - malian M - type cofilin , we cloned the cDNAs encoding mouse M - type cofilin . Initially , the PCR method was applied to clone C 4 M NM 0 - myogenesis of mouse C2 cells . Balb 3T3 cells ( a ) , C2 myoblasts ( b ) , FIG . 3 . Increased expression of ”type cofilin during in vitro and C2 myotubes ( c ) were harvested with a cell scraper and collected by centrifugation . The packed cells were dissolved in 3 volumes of a lysis buffer ( OFarrell et al . , 1977 ) . Each lysate ( 5 pl ) was applied for immu - noblotting with MAB - 22 combined with two - dimensional PAGE . The expression of “type cofilin increased in the C2 cells , which were main - tained in a differentiation medium for 5 days to form myotubes ( c ) . NM , NM - type cofilin ; M , “type cofilin ; arrows , phosphorylated form of NM - type cofilin . The phosphorylated form of “type cofilin was scarcely detectable in these cases . cofilin cDNA from reverse transcripts of C2 myotube mRNA . Specific oligonucleotide primers for the chicken cofilin sequence ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) were used to amplify the co - filin sequence , and then the PCR product of 0 . 5 kb was cloned , and the sequence was analyzed . One of the clones ( pMMC - 4P , Fig . 4 ) appeared to encode the M - type cofilin , since the deduced amino acid sequence was related to but clearly distinct from the previously reported sequences of mammalian cofilin . To obtain the cDNA containing the complete sequence of the M - type cofilin , we constructed a cDNAlibrary from C2 myotube mRNA and screened it using 32P - labeled pMMC - 4P as a probe . Five positive clones were isolated , and the entire sequence of the largest clone of 3 kb ( pMMC - 3 ) and the partial sequence of the clone of 1 . 1 kb ( pMMC - 6 ) were determined ( Fig . 4 ) . pMMC - 3 contained 2 , 974 nucleotides and the open reading frame of 498 base pairs ( position 132 - 629 ) coding for a protein of 166 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 18 , 736 ( Fig . 5 ) . The whole sequence of pMMC - 4P was detected in the coding region of pMMC - 3 . On the other hand , the partial se - quences around the 5’ and 3’ ends of pMMC - 6 were entirely contained within pMMC - 3 except for the poly ( A ) tail , which followed 17 bases downstream from the putative polyadenyla - tion signal AATAAA ( corresponding to the position 1439 - 1444 of pMMC - 3 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . Another putative polyadenylation signal occurred in pMMC - 3 at the position 2921 - 2925 , 8 bases up - stream from the poly ( A ) tail ( Fig . 5 ) . The amino acid sequence deduced from pMMC - 3 was re - vealed to be 96 . 4 % identical with that of chicken cofilin ( Abe et al . , 1990 ) and 81 . 3 % with mouse brain cofilin ( Moriyama et al . , 1990b ) ( Fig . 6 ) . Like cofilin and its related proteins ( ADF / destrin ) reported previously , it also contained a nuclear local - ization signal ( Abe et al . , 1993 ; Iida et al . , 1992 ) ( residues 26 - 36 ) , actin and phosphoinositides - binding site ( Moriyama et al . , 1992 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1990a , 1990b ) ( residues 104 - 115 ) , as well as the region homologous to the amino - terminal sequence Mammalian Muscle - type Cofilin 15283 I l l PMMC - 3 1 " " - " " " " c - " - t " c - - c - PMMC - 6 I pMMC4P " 500bp - FIG . 4 .

Such a high homology between them strongly suggests that the protein encoded by pMMC - 3 is one of the cofilin isoforms . Distribution of mRNAs Encoding NM - type and M - type Cofilin - The distribution of mRNAs for cofilin isoforms among mouse tissues and cultured cells was examined by Northern blotting proved with the cDNAs of their respective cofilin iso - forms ( Fig . 7 ) . When the cDNA encoding mouse NM - type cofilin was used as a probe , mRNA of 1 . 4 kb was detected from a wide variety of tissues and cultured cells ( Fig . 7a ) . Among the tis - sues examined , brain , lung , spleen , and testis contained rela - tively high levels of mRNA for NM - type cofilin , while skeletal muscle scarcely contained it . These results are consistent with those in the report by Moriyama et al . ( 1990a ) . The mRNA for NM - type cofilin was expressed in large amounts in various types of cultured cells in a growing state . In C2 cells , the amount of the mRNA decreased significantly as they differen - tiated to form multinucleated myotubes . In contrast , when Northern blotting was performed using mouse " type cofilin cDNA as a probe , two species of mRNAs of 1 . 8 and 3 kb were detected in several tissues and cells ( Fig . 7b ) . It is possible that the two transcripts were generated by the selective use of either of two polyadenylation signals ( Fig . 5 ) , because the sizes of the mRNAs corresponded to those esti - mated from the cDNA sequences . This possibility was verified by the result given in Fig . 8 , showing that only the mRNA of 3 kb was detected by using the cDNA fragment , which consti - tutes a region downstream from the first polyadenylation sig - nal , as a probe . Among the tissues examined , heart , skeletal muscle , and testis contained considerable amounts of the mRNA for M - type cofilin ( Fig . 7b ) . The mRNA was also expressed in 3Y1 fibro - blasts , C2 myogenic cells , and A10 smooth muscle cells at high levels . However , the ratio of the two transcripts of 1 . 8 and 3 kb vaned among the tissues and cells . The mRNA of 3 kb was expressed at high level in skeletal muscle but only at low level in testis ( Figs . 7b and 8 ) . The amount of mRNA for M - type cofilin in C2 cells apparently increased during differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes ( Fig . 7b ) . Since the mRNA for NM - type cofilin decreased during myogenesis , the result indi - cates that isoform transition of cofilin from N " to M - type during myogenesis is regulated at a pretranslational level . Al - though the mRNAof 3 kb was scarcely detected in C2 cells ( Fig . 7b ) , it became clearly detectable when poly ( A ) ' RNA ( mRNA ) isolated from whole RNA extracts of C2 myotube with an oligo ( dT ) - cellulose column was applied to Northern blotting ( Fig . 8 ) . Southern Blot Analysis of Mouse Genomic DNA - Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA was carried out using cDNAs for NM - or M - type cofilin as probes , each of which was a 0 . 5 - kb fragment containing almost the entire coding region ( Fig . 9 ) . The cDNAfor NM - type cofilin strongly hybridized with two fragments in the genomic DNA digest by each restriction enzyme and also weakly with some additional fragments ( Fig . 9a ) . In contrast , a major single band was detected in each restriction fragment of genomic DNA when the cDNA for M - type cofilin was used as a probe ( Fig . 9b ) . These results indicate definitely that M - and NM - type are encoded by different genes . It is also suggested that there is a single gene for mouse " type cofilin and the two transcripts for " type cofilin ( Figs . 7 and 8 ) are generated from the same gene by the alternative choice of polyadenylation signals . DISCUSSION Cofilin was originally discovered in mammalian brain ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ) , but it is now known to be widely distrib - uted among both non - muscle and muscle tissues ( Abe et al . , 1989 ; Hayakawa et al . , 1993 ; Moriyama et al . , 1990a ; Yonezawa et al . , 1987 ) . Our previous investigations demonstrated that cofilin is expressed at a high level in embryonic ( Abe et al . , 19891 , denervated ( Shinagawa et al . , 1993 ) , and dystrophic ( Hayakawa et al . , 1993 ) skeletal muscles . In developing muscle , it forms a complex with G - actin at a 1 : l molar ratio to inacti - vate actin for polymerization ( Abe et al . , 1989 ) . The location of cofilin in muscle cells in culture differs under varying culture conditions ( Abe et al . , 1993 ; Ono et al . , 1993 ) . We assume that cofilin is involved in regulating the assembly and / or redistri - bution of actin and in modulating its turnover during myofi - brillogenesis and myofibril disorganization although its func - tional roles in skeletal muscle have not yet been established . The results in this study definitely demonstrate that a unique cofilin isoform of M - type is expressed predominantly in muscle tissues of mammals , which differs in primary structure from the previously described NM - type cofilin ( Matsuzaki et al . , 1988 ; Moriyama et al . , 1990b ; Ogawa et al . , 1990 ) . Of interest is whether the M - type and NM - type cofilins exhibit different functional properties . The mouse M - type cofilin exhibits the highest sequence simi - larity with chicken cofilin ( 96 . 4 % identity in amino acid resi - dues ) ( Fig . 6 ) but has lower homology with the mouse NM - type cofilin ( 81 . 3 % identity ) . It also exhibits considerably high se - quence homology with porcine destrin ( 69 . 3 % identity ) and with chicken ADF ( 70 . 5 % identity ) . The mouse M - type cofilin contained the sequences responsible for actin binding ( Moriyama et al . , 1992 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1991a ) and nuclear localization identified in porcine ( Iida et al . , 1992 ) and chicken cofilin ( Abe et al . , 1993 ) . A stretch of basic amino acids of Lys - Lys - Arg - Lys - Lys ( residues 30 - 341 , which is essential for heat shock - induced and dimethyl sulfoxide - induced nuclear translo - cation of cofilin ( Nishida et al . , 19871 , is conserved between the M - and the NM - type cofilin . However , in the case of the M - type cofilin , residue 26 , which precedes the stretch of basic residues , is Glu , while the residue is Pro in the previously known verte - brate cofilin / ADF / destrin . It was reported that in the case of the nuclear localization signal sequence of SV40 large T antigen ( Pro - Lys - Lys - Lys - Arg - Lys - Val ) , an altered sequence without Pro showed significantly reduced nuclear targeting activity ( Kalderon et al . , 19841 , and therefore Matsuzaki et al . ( 1988 ) suggested that the nuclear localization signal of cofilin may be organized by a stretch of basic amino acids and a preceding Pro residue . Accordingly , there may be a difference in nuclear tar - geting activity between the nuclear localization signals of the NM - and the M - type cofilins .

The positions of 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNAs are indicated . mRNA of 3 kb is marked by an arrowhead . ceivable that the " type cofilin functions as a regulator for actin assembly in skeletal muscle and a modulator for muscle functions . Of interest is whether the N " and " type cofilins can interact differentially with muscle a - actin isoform and non - muscle / 3 - and y - actin isoforms , which are transiently ex - pressed in developing muscle cells . To understand further the function of the " type cofilin , it will be necessary to clarify the mode of interaction of this protein with actin . It is now possible to produce the recombinant cofilins with functional activity in Escherichia coli with cloned cDNAs ( data not shown ) . With these proteins , biochemical studies on the cofilin variants are now in progress . kb a b 23 - - 9 . 4 6 . 6 4 . 4 2 . 3 2 . 0 E P H K E P H K FIG . 9 . Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA . 20 pg of chromosomal DNA from mouse liver was digested with EcoRI ( E ) , PstI ( P ) , Hind111 ( H ) , or KpnI ( K ) and then separated on 0 . 7 % agarose gel . Hybridization probes for NM - type ( a ) and M - type ( b ) cofilins were the same as described in the legend to Fig . 7 . The membranes were finally washed in 0 . 1 x SSC , 0 . 5 % SDS at 68 " C for NM - type cofilin , or 0 . 1 x SSC , 0 . 2 % SDS at 65 " C for M - type cofilin . As judged by the 3 ' - non - coding sequence of the " type cofilin cDNA and the transcribed messages as seen by Northern blot - ting , two species of mRNAs for " type cofilin appear to be generated by the alternative selection of two polyadenylation signals . Similar cases have been reported for other actin - bind - ing proteins , chicken ADF ( Adams et al . , 1990 ) and human villin ( Arpin et al . , 1988 ; Pringault et al . , 1991 ) . Unlike the mRNAs for ADF and villin , however , those for the " type co - filin were detected at different ratios in various tissues and cultured cells . The transcript of 1 . 8 kb was detected in all the tissues and cells that express the " type cofilin , whereas that of 3 kb was in heart and skeletal muscle at high levels , sug - gesting that the second polyadenylation signal is used prefer - entially in heart and skeletal muscles . Although the functional significance of the elongation of the 3 ' - non - coding region of mRNA has not been elucidated , it might be speculated that the alteration in the non - coding sequence may lead to a modulation of localization , stability , and / or the secondary structure of the mRNA and thereby also a change in the efficiency of translation of messages . So far , only a single cofilin isoform has been detected in chicken , and it is expressed in both muscle and non - muscle cells . Interestingly , chicken cofilin is quite similar to the mam - malian " type cofilin in terms of the homology in the primary structure . As reported by Bamburg and Bray ( 1987 ) , ADF , which is a protein related to cofilin with distinct function , is abundant in chicken non - muscle tissues and smooth muscles . In spite of a functional difference , cofilin and ADF share a common characteristic feature , namely that in response to heat shock or treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide , they are trans - ported into nuclei to form rod - shaped structures together with actin ( Nishida et al . , 1987 ; Ono et al . , 1993 ) . This suggests that the functions of cofilin in chicken non - muscle cells may be partly supplemented by ADF . REFERENCES Abe , H . , and Obinata , T . ( 1989 ) J . Bioehem .
