Growth Factor Action and Intracellular pH Regulation in Fibroblasts EVIDENCE FOR A MAJOR ROLE OF THE Na + / H + ANTIPORT * ( Received for publication , October 31 , 1983 ) Gilles L ' AIIemain , Sonia Paris , and Jacques Pouyssegur From the Centre de Biochimie , Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique , Uniuersite de Nice , Parc Valrose , 06034 Nice , France Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts ( CC139 ) possess in their plasma membrane an amiloride - sensitive Na + / H + antiport , activated by growth factors . Measurements of intracellular pH ( pHi ) , using equilibrium distribu - tion of benzoic acid , provide evidence €or a major role of this antiport in 1 ) regulation of cytoplasmic pH , in response to an acute acid load or to varying external pH values , and 2 ) the increase in cytoplasmic pH ( by 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 pH unit ) upon addition of growth factors ( cy - thrombin and insulin ) to Go / Gt - arrested cells . Indeed , these two processes are Na + - dependent and amiloride - sensitive ; furthermore , CC139 - derived mutant cells , lacking the Na + / H + exchange activity , are greatly im - paired in pHi regulation and present no cytoplasmic alkalinization upon growth factor addition . In wild type Go - arrested cells , the amplitude of the mitogen - induced alk ~ inization reflects directly the activity of the Na + / H + antiport , and is tightly correlated with the magnitude of DNA synthesis stimulation . Therefore , we conclude that cytoplasmic pH , regulated by the Na + / H + antiport , is of crucial importance in the mitogenic response . Quiescent cultures of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts ( CC139 ) can be stimulated to reinitiate DNA synthesis and cell division by addition of serum or purified growth factors ( I ) . One of the earliest responses of CC139 cells to mitogenic agents ( a - thrombin and insulin ) is the activation of a Na " / H + exchange in the plasma membrane ( 2 ) , an early event observed in other cell types and with a variety of growth factors ( 3 - 7 ) . The Na + / H + antiporter mediates a reversible and electroneutral1 : I exchange , is inhibited by amiloride , ( KI = 3 PM ) and possesses a similar affinity for Lic and Na + ( 8 ) , some characteristics described also for other animal cells ( 9 - 12 ) . In a recent pharmacological study with amiloride analogs ( Ir ; varying from 2 . 10 - 6 to 4 , lO - ' EA ) , we established that the functioning of the Na + / H + exchange system , in HC0 ; - free medium , is required for growth factor - induced DNA synthesis ( 13 ) . This conclusion has been confirmed by the physiological properties of mutants defective in Na + / H ' exchange activity .

The costs of publication of this article were de - frayed in part by the payment of page charges . This article must therefore be hereby marked ~ ~ ~ ~ e r t L ~ e ~ ~ t ' ' in accordance with 18 U .

Moreover , since the addition of growth factors to quiescent fibroblasts causes a rapid intracellular alkalinization ( 4 , 5 , 14 ) , cytoplasmic pH ( pH , ) has been proposed as a putative mitogenic signal . It was therefore of interest to analyze the role of the Na + / H + antiport in pHi r e ~ ~ a t i o n and growth factor - induced rise in pHi . Using the distribution of [ ' * C ] benzoic acid to measure in - tracellular pH in CC139 fibroblasts , we demonstrate that , in HCOS - free medium , the Na + / H + exchanger is responsible for 1 ) the rapid pHi recovery in response to an acid load and 2 ) the alka ~ inization induced in growth factor - stimulated quies - cent cells . These two conclusions are based on the observa - tions that rapid pHi recovery as well as growth factor - induced pHi rise both are i ) P ! a + - dependent , ii ) amiloride - sensitive , and iii ) abolished in the CCl39 - derived mutant cells , PS120 , lacking the Na + / H + exchange activity . ' EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture - The Chinese hamster lung fibroblast line CC139 ( American Type Culture Collection ) and the CCl39 - derived mutant PS120 , lacking the amiloride - sensitive Na * / H * exchange activity , were maintained in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ( Gibco H21 ) supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum , penicillin ( 50 units / ml ) , and streptomycin ( 50 pg / ml ) in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % COZ , 95 % air at 37 " C . The technique €or isolation and the biochemical char - acterization of the mutant PS120 will appear elsewhere . ' Cells were arrested in Go / Gt essentially as described ( 15 ) : confluent monolayers , grown either in 16 - mm 24 - well plates or in 35 - mm dishes ( Falcon ) , were washed with serum - fee medium and incubated for 20 h in serum - free DME medium / Ham ' s F12 medium ( 1 : l ) . [ " C / Benroic Acid Uptake - Cultures were first equilibrated for 30 or 60 min ( as indicated in the legends ) at the desired pH in a HC0 : - free saline medium ( 130 mM NaCl , 5 mM KC1 , 2 mM CaCI2 , 1 mM Mgf & ) c ~ n ~ i n i n g 5 mM glucose and a 20 mM concentration of one of the following buffers : MES ' for pH values from 5 . 6 to 6 . 2 , PIPES for 6 . 4 to 7 . 0 , HEPES for 7 . 2 to 7 . 8 , or EPPS for 8 . 0 to 8 . 6 . pH was adjusted either with HCI or Tris ( medium referred to as glucose / saline medium ) . For pH ; measurements , [ 7 - t4C ] benzoic acid or , in some control experiments , DM0 was added at 1 pCi / ml unless otherwise stated ( final concentrations of 34 I . ~ M and 20 p ~ , respec - tively ) . After incubation at 37 " C for various times , the dishes or wells were washed rapidly four times with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 ( the four washes by aspiration lasted 7 f 1 s ) . Cells were solubilized in 0 . 1 M NaOH and radioactivity was assayed by liquid scintillation spectrometry . Extracellular Space - To estimate the radioactivity trapped in the extracellular space , the weak acid was replaced in parallel cultures by an impermeant marker such as ~ - [ l - ~ H ] sorbitol or D - [ l - ' 4cC ] mannitol ( 1 pCi / ml ) .

Then , the medium was aspirated , the cells quickly washed twice with a Ne + - free saline at pH 8 . 0 , incubated 30 s in this medium , before replacement by the same medium containing [ “C ] benzoic acid and precooled to 2 “C . The dishes were then immediately washed as described above . Under these conditions , the intracellular pH is much more acidic than the external one ( see Fig . 3 ) , so that intracellular accumulation of benzoic acid becomes negligible , especially at 2 “C for a very short time . The estimate of extracellular space obtained by this method is in close agreement with the value calculated from mannitol or sorbitol trap - ping , which indicates that these sugars and the weak acid are similarly eliminated by washing . IntracelEular Water Space - The intracellular water space was cal - culated from the equilibrium uptake of 3 - O - methyl - ~ - [ l - ~ H ] glucose ( 16 ) . The cells were incubated with 5 pCi / ml ( 5 p ~ ) of this nonme - tabolizable hexose in gfucose - free saline , pH 7 . 4 , for 60 min at 37 ‘C , then washed and assayed for radioactivity as described above . Uptake reached a plateau after 40 - 50 min and remained constant for up to at least 120 min . After correction for the extracellular space ( see above ) , the intracellular volume accessible to 3 - 0 - methyl - D - glucose was determined to be 5 pl / mg of protein . This value for intracellular water space was independent of the growth state ( similar in quiescent cells and exponentially growing cells ) and of the external pH ( from the parental cell line , CC139 , and the mutant , PS120 . 6 . 0 to 8 . 0 ) . Moreover , no significant difference was found between Calculation of pHi - The counts measured after [ “Clbenzoic acid uptake were corrected for i ) radioactivity trapped in the extracellular space , ii ) loss of intracellular radioactivity during the washing pro - cedure , estimated as 10 % ( see “Results” ) . Then , the intracellular concentration of benzoic acid , B ; ( in cpm / bl ) , was calculated , with the intracellular volume determined from the protein measurement , and intraceIlular pH was calculated with the simplified equation pH ! = pH , + log > , where Bo = cpm / pl in the external medium . Since the pK . , for benzoic acid is 4 . 2 , the total concentration of benzoic acid could usually be used in this equation , instead of the concentration of the charged form . Only at the more acidic pH values ( or at all pH values for DMO ) was a more complete equation used ( 17 ) . MateriaL ~ - [ 7 - ~ ~ CC ] Benzoic acid , [ “CIDMO , ~ - [ l - ~ H ] sorbitol and D - [ l - “C ] mannitol were from New England Nuclear , and 3 - 0 - methyl - D - [ l - 3H ] glucose from the Radiochemical Centre ( Amersham ) . The amiloride analog was a gift of Dr . E . Cragoe , Jr . ( Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Lab ) . Highly purified human a - thrombin ( 2660 NIH units / mg ) was a generous gift of Dr . J . W . Fenton , I1 ( Albany , NY ) . Bovine thrombin ( ~ 3 0 0 NIH units / mg ) and bovine crystalline insulin were from Sigma . All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available . B - BO RESULTS ~ e t e r ~ ~ n a ~ ~ o n of pH , with f‘4C ] Benzoic Acid - Measure - ment of the distribution of a labeled weak acid in the intra - cellular and extracellular water is a simple method for esti - mating the intracellular pH that has been widely used in a variety of cell systems ( 17 ) . The weak acid [ ‘4C ] benzoic acid proved to be a very convenient pHi indicator in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts . As shown in Fig . LA , benzoic acid was taken up by CC139 cells very rapidly at 37 “C . The accumulation reached a plateau within 15 s , independent of the external pH ( pH , ) . Even at the highest pHs used in this study ( pH , = 8 - 9 ) , the equilibration was extremely fast , in spite of the very low concentration of the permeant uncharged form ( pK , = 4 . 2 ) . Thus , because of this high diffusion rate across the plasma membrane , benzoic acid appears to be a suitable probe to measure rapid pHi changes . One possible drawback of this rapid diffusion might be a significant leakage out of the cell during the washing procedure , leading to an underestimation of pH , . However , Fig . 1B shows that , at 2 “C , benzoic acid diffusion is markedly slowed down , since efflux occurs with a tIl2 of approximately 50 s . Accordingly , the washing procedure adopted routinely in this study { four washes at 2 “C in 7 f 1 s ) resulted in a loss of about 10 % of 4 A 3 1 O O 2 : ~ ~ P - T ‘I _ 0 1 2 TIME FIG . 1 . Time course of [ ‘“C ] benmic acid uptake ( A ) and effiux ( B ) in CC139 cells . A , confluent cultures of Go / G1 - arrested cells , in 35 - mm dishes ( 0 . 3 mg of protein ) were equilibrated for 60 min at 37 “C in the HCOi - free glucose / saline medium , pH 7 . 4 , before addition of 1 pCi / ml of [ ‘4C ] benzoic acid . After the times indicated , uptake was terminated as described under “Experimental Proce - dures . ” Each point represents the mean of triplicate determinations . B , Go / G1 - arrested cells , in 35 - mm dishes ( 0 . 4 mg of protein ) were pre - equilibrated for 30 min in a glucose / saline medium , pH 6 . 0 , before addition of [ “Clbenzoic acid ( 1 pCi / ml ) for 5 min . At time 0 , the cells were quickly washed twice with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 , incubated for various times ( up to 1 . 5 min ) in this buffer on ice , and washed again twice . The time indicated refers to the end of the total washing procedure . The 100 % ( obtained by extrapolation ) corresponds to 14 , 200 cpm . Under these conditions , the contribution of the extracellular space is negligible ( about 200 cpm ) . Each value is the average of duplicates . the intracellular radioactivity . Therefore , all experimental values were corrected for this estimated leakage before pHi calculations . The remarkable stability , up to 60 min at least , of the steady state accumulation of benzoic acid ( Fig . LA ) suggests that there is no significant accumulation of this probe in intracellular compartments , or , at least , if there is some trapping , it must be rapidly equ ~ ibrated . In fact , two experi - mental observations demonstrate that benzoic acid distribu - tion yields a correct estimate of cytoplasmic pH . 1 ) When CC139 cells , loaded with 80 - 100 mM Na’ or Li’ , are incubated in a Na + and Li + - free medium , a sudden intracellular acidifi - cation occurs , due to the reverse functioning of the Na + / H’ antiport ( 8 ) . Under these conditions , a pHi decrease of more than 2 pH units , in 5 min , could be measured with the benzoic acid method ( not shown ) . The accumulated radioactivity dropped , in a few minutes , to a value corresponding to the extracellular space ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) , which argues against any s i ~ i ~ c a n t i n t r a c e l l ~ a r binding . 2 ) Digi - tonin has been shown to dissipate pH gradients across the plasma membrane of CC139 cells ( 8 ) . When 50 PM digitonin was added to cells after uptake of [ ‘ * C ] benzoic acid , pHi calculated from the intracellular radioactivity was found to equilibrate very rapidly with pH , , whatsoever the initial pHi ( not shown ) . Since digitonin selectively penneabilizes the plasma membrane ( 18 , 19 ) , this result definitely rules out any significant contribution of the intracellular organelles in the pHi value calculated from benzoic acid distribution . In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts , it has been recently reported that benzoic acid and DM0 accumulations yielded similar intracellular pH values that could be attributed to cytoplasmic pH , as judged from the absence of effect of mitochondrial inhibitors ( 4 ) . In CC139 cells as well , very similar estimates of pHi were ob - tained with the two probes [ ‘4C ] benzoic acid and [ ’ * C ] DMO , over a wide range of external pHs ( not shown ) . However , it must be noted that the weak acid method ( whatever the probe used ) presents some limitations when intracellular pH is markedly more acidic than the extracellu - lar one . Since the effect of small changes in extracellular by gu e s t on A ugu s t 29 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m iVa + / H + Antiport in pHi ~ ~ g u ~ t ~ o ~ and Growth Factor Action 581 1 space can then be considerable ( 17 ) , it was difficult to obtain an accurate determination of pHi by this method , when pHi < pH , by more than 1 . 5 pH units . Recovery of pHi following an Intracellular Acid bad - When cells are loaded with NH : and then shifted to a NH : - free medium , the rapid diffusion of the uncharged form NH , out of the cell causes an intracellular acidification ( 17 ) . As shown in Fig . 2 ( left ) , exposure of CC139 fibroblasts to 20 mM NHZ for 30 min led to a significant decrease in pHi , likely due to a net uptake of the charged form NH : via the Na + , K + - ATPase ( 20 ) . Upon NH : removal from the external medium , pHi further decreased , but , in a 130 mM Na + - containing medium , this acidification was rather low ( - 0 . 3 pH unit ) and very transient . Within 10 min , pHi had nearly returned to the control level . A quite different pHi recovery pattern was observed in the mutant PS120 , deficient in amiloride - sensitive Na + / H + ex - change activity , ’ after the same NH : treatment ( Fig . 2 , right ) . First , the intracellular acidification was much more pro - nounced ( pHi declined from 7 . 1 to 6 . 2 within 2 min after NH : removal ) . Second , the recovery of pHi was considerably slower than in the wild type , since it took about 1 h for pHi to reach the level of control cells . These differences observed between the mutant PS120 and the parental cell line strongly suggest that the Na + / H + anti - port is directly involved in pHi regulation . This is indeed confirmed by the data presented in Fig . 3 . Acidification fol - lowing NH : removal was markedly increased in the wild type when Na + was omitted from the NH : - free medium . pHi fell abruptly to 6 . 2 and recovered only slowly , as in the mutant incubated in a Na + - containing medium ( Fig . 2 , right ) . In both cases , the higher the NH : concentration in the preincubation medium was , the greater was the acidification and the slower was the pHi recovery ( data not shown ) . In the wild type ( Fig . 3 ) , pH ; could be rapidly restored by addition of 130 mM Na + or Li + . After the same acid load , 40 mM Na + was only slightly less effective than 130 mM Na + in restoring pH , ( not shown ) . But , when 40 mM Na + was added together with 0 . 25 mM DMA , an amiloride analog known to completely inhibit the Na + / H + exchange under these conditions ( 13 ) , the rate of pHi - i 6 . 2 L I 1 0 10 20 3 0 0 10 20 3 0 4 5 6 0 ‘ 1 - TIME ( min ) FIG . 2 .

At time 0 , the cells were rinsed twice and shifted to a NHt - free medium , pH 7 . 4 , containing 130 mM NaCl ( 0 ) or 130 mM choline C1 ( A ) and [ “C ] benzoic acid ( 1 pCi / ml ) . After 10 min , the Na + - free medium was replaced in some cultures by a medium containing 130 mM NaCl ( A ) or 130 mM LiCl ( D ) . The intracellular pH at the end of the NHZ - pretreatment ( time 0 ) was determined as described for Fig . 2 . Inset , confluent cells ( 0 . 3 mg of protein per well ) were first loaded with 20 m M NH : for 60 min and then shifted to a NH : - and Na + - free medium for 10 min , as described above . At this time , either 40 mM NaCl ( A ) or 40 mM NaCl and 0 . 25 mM DMA ( V ) was added ( a 100 mM stock solution of DMA was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide ) . At the times indicated , pHi was calculated , as previously described , from the mean of triplicates . FIG . 4 . Intracellular pH as a function of extracellular pH in exponentially growing cells : comparison of the wild type CC139 with the CC139 - derived mutant cells PS120 . Confluent exponentially growing cells of the two cell types , the parental line CC139 ( A ) and the mutant PS120 ( A ) , were incubated for 60 min in the saline / glucose medium , containing 5 % fetal calf serum , with pH varying from 5 . 6 to 8 . 4 . Then , the cells were shifted for 10 min to the same medium containing [ “CCjbenzoic acid at the following specific activity : 0 . 2 pCi / ml for pH values 5 . 6 and 6 . 0 , 0 . 5 pCi / ml for pH values from 6 . 4 to 7 . 2 , and 1 pCi / ml for pH values from 7 . 4 to 8 . 6 . pHi was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” Each point represents the average of duplicates . recovery was greatly reduced ( Fig . 3 , inset ) . Taken together , the low rate of pHi recovery in the mutant lacking Na + / H + exchange , as well as the Na + ( or Li + ) - de - pendence and the sensitivity to amiloride for pHi recovery in the wild type , clearly demonstrate that the Na + / H + antiport plays a central role in the regulation of cytoplasmic pH in response to an acid load . Effect of Extracellu ~ r pH on tke Steady Stute pHi - To test whether the Na + / H + exchange system is also involved in pHi regulation in the face of external pH “insults , ” we compared , in both the parental strain CC139 and the Na + / H + - exchange - by gu e s t on A ugu s t 29 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 5812 Nail€ii Antiport in pHi Regulation and Growth Factor Action deficient mutant PS120 , the influence of extracellular pH on the steady state pH , Exponential cultures of both strains grown at pH 7 . 4 , were exposed to various external pH vatues , in a HC0 ; - free medium , and the new steady state pHi ( estab - lished within 30 min ) was determined after 1 h . As shown in Fig . 4 , pH ; is greatly influenced by the external pH in both strains but is significantly more acidic in the mutant than in the wild type over the entire range of pH , values tested , from 5 . 6 to 8 . 6 . Thus , with the possible exception of very high pH , values , at which the difference between the two strains ap - pears to decrease , the extrusion of protons by the Na + / H + antiporter contributes significantly to the regulation of pHi , over a wide range of external pH values , in exponential cultures . Effect of Mitogenic Stimulation on pH ; - CC139 cells can be arrested in Go / GI by serum - growth factor deprivation , and stimulated to reinitiate DNA synthesis by addition of the purified growth factors thrombin and insulin ( 1 ) . One of the earliest events triggered by mitogens in quiescent CC139 cells is the stimulation of the amiloride - sensitive Na + / H + exchange ( 2 ) . Concomitantly , a significant alkalinization of the cyto - plasm appears ( 14 ) . The time course of this growth factor - induced alkalinization in CC139 cells is presented in Fig . 5A . Within 5 min after the addition of a mitogenic Combination of thrombin and insulin , pHi rose by - 0 . 2 pH unit and remained elevated for at least 60 min . At pH , = 7 . 4 , the pH ; shift ranged from 0 . 15 to 0 . 30 pH unit in independent exper - iments , and was similar for fetal calf serum ( 5 % ) and the combination of or - thrombin ( 1 unitlml ) plus insulin ( 10 pg / ml ) . To test whether the activation of the Na + / H + exchange was directly responsible for this alkalinization , we first investi - gated the influence of thrombin and insulin on pHi in the Na + / H + - deficient mutant . As shown in Fig . 5B , no alkalini - zation was induced in PSl20 by the growth factors . Instead , a significant transient acidification ( by - 0 . 2 pH unit ) oc - curred during the first few minutes , followed by a progressive recovery of pHi . After 10 - 15 min , pH ; had returned back to the initial value , and it remained stable at this level for at least 30 min . Interestingly , this net discrepancy between the wild type and the mutant was observed over a wide range of external pH values . Fig . 6 represents the steady state pHi for the two strains , after 10 min in the presence or absence of growth factors , as a function of the external pH . In the parental strain CC139 , the growth factor - induced rise in pHj was observed from pH , 6 . 6 to pH , 8 . 6 ( although less pro - nounced at the highest pH , ) . In contrast , in the mutant PS120 , the steady state pHi was not significantly altered by the addition of growth factors at all pH , values . It is notewor - thy that even at the more alkaline pH , values ( above 7 4 , at which thrombin and insulin induce reinitiation of DNA syn - thesis ( data not shown ) , pHi was not raised by these growth factors . If the lack of Na + / H + exchange in the mutant is responsible for this absence of alkalinization , the growth factor - induced pHi rise observed in the wild type should be amiloride - sensi - tive and Na + - dependent . Fig . 7 shows that these two predic - tions were indeed verified . The growth factor - induced increase in pHi was inhibited , in a conce ~ tration - de ~ ndent manner , by the amiloride analog DMA . At 25 mM Na + o , the addition of 3 p ~ DMA completely abolished the pHi shift and even resulted , after 15 min , in a significant acidification of the cell . Half - maximal inhibition of the growth factor effect on pHi was caused by - 0 . 7 p ~ DMA . Under the same conditions ( 25 mM Na + , and pH , = 7 . 41 , the Na + / H + exchange , measured by " Na influx in Li + - loaded cells , was inhibited 50 % by 0 . 3 p ~ DMA ( 13 ) . The close agreement between these two values provides further evidence that the Na + / H + exchange system is directly responsible for the growth factor - induced alkalini - zation . This conclusion is also supported by the data of Fig . 7 ( inset ) showing the influence of the external Na + concentra - tion . Reducing the Na + concentration in the incubation me - dium below 30 mM markedly decreased the amplitude of the alkalinization observed 15 min after the addition of thrombin and insulin . Half - maximal response was obtained at about 5 mM Na + , . By measurement of net H + fluxes , the apparent affinity for Na + of the amiioride - sensitive Na + / H + exchange in CC139 cells was estimated to be about 10 mM ( 8 ) . Therefore , these data together with the amiloride sensitivity , strongly suggest that the ~ p l i t u d e of the mitogen - de ~ endent alkaf - inization reflects directly the activity of the Na + / H + antiport .

Insulin alone elevated pHi only slightly after a lag period of 10 - 15 min ( not shown ) but it substantially potentiated the thrombin effect on pHi , as indicated by the leftward shift of the dose - response curve and the increased maximal effect .

Finally , epidermal growth factor that is poorly mitogenic for CC139 cells , causes only a small alkalinization ( by - 0 . 1 pH unit ) . All these data show a striking correlation between the amplitude of the alkalinization induced by growth factors and their mitogenicity . DISCUSSION We have previously demonstrated the existence of a Na + / H ' exchange system in the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts ( 8 ) . The kinetic parameters of this antiport strongly suggested that it should play an important role in regulation of intracellular pH . In the present report , we provide a direct verification of this prediction , with mea - surements of cytoplasmic pH by the weak acid distribution method , using [ " CC ] benzoic acid as a probe . One way of appreciating pHi regulation by cells is to mea - sure the recovery of pHi after an acute intracellular acid load . In CC139 cells , the recovery of pH ( , after a transient exposure to NH : , was highly dependent on external Na + and was inhibited by amiloride . Similar results have been recently obtained in human fibroblasts , with an inde ~ ndent method for measuring pHi ( 5 ) . In addition , a CC139 - derived mutant ( PS120 ) , that lacks the Na + / H + exchange activity , was greatly impaired in pHi recovery after an acid load , as compared with the wild type . Taken together , these data clearly demonstrate the necessity of a functional Na + / H + antiport for a quick recovery from a drastic acid load . However , it must be pointed out that a slow pHi recovery nevertheless occurred when the Na + / H + exchange was either absent ( Fig . 2 , right ) or inhibited ( Fig . 3 ) , which suggests that other pathways exist in CC ' t39 cells for H + extrusion . Regulation of cytoplasmic pH can also be defined as the capacity to resist changes in the pHi under steady state conditions , upon imposition of varying external pH values , for instance . The pHi uersm pH , plots for exponential cultures of the parental and mutant strains ( Fig . 4 ) reveal that the Na + / H + exchange activity contributes significantly to main - taining pH ; more alkaline than the external medium over a wide range of external pH ( up to pH 7 . 8 ) . In contrast , in Go / GI - arrested cells , the ability to regulate pHi was not markedly different , whether or not the Na + / H + antiport was functional ( Fig . 6 ) . A similar difference in pH ; regulation was observed between unfertilized and fertilized sea urchin eggs ( 22 ) , where it was concluded that fertilization activates a Na + - dependent " pH - stat . ' ' Again , the ability of the mutant PS120 to maintain pH , above pH , over a wide range of external pH values , despite the absence of the Na + / H + exchange activity , strongly sug - gests the existence of other H + - extruding mechanisms . AI - though an ener ~ - consuming pH ; regulation has been dem - onstrated in a variety of animal cells ( 23 , 24 ; for reviews , 17 , 25 ) the exact nature of the mechanism involved in this regu - lation is still controversial ( see Ref . 26 for a review ) . The Na + / H + antiport - defective mutant PS120 should be a useful tool to characterize some of these processes . The addition of growth factors to quiescent CC139 cells causes an intracellular alkalinization by 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 pH unit . A similar change in pHi has been reported in mitogen - stimulated lymphocytes ( 27 ) , mouse fibroblasts ( 4 ) , and human fibro - blasts ( 5 ) . Since this alkalinization is dependent on the exter - nal Na + concentration and sensitive to amiloride in the wild type CC139 cells , and is not observed in the Na + / H + antiport - deficient mutant , we conclude that a functional Na + / H + an - tiport is needed for this pHi shift to occur . This rules out the possibility that the pHi increase is due in part to the activation of H + - consuming metabolic reaction ( s ) or to a change in internal proton buffer capacity . Since Na ' acts as a competi - tive inhibitor for H + on the Na * / H + antiport ( 8 , 28 , 29 ) , the cytoplasmic pH might depend on the intracellular Na + con - centration , itself regulated by the Na + / K + - ATPase . Accord - ingly , the new steady state pHi in mitogen - stimulated cells should be determined by both transport systems , the Na + / H + exchange and the Na + / K + - ATPase . In fact , the addition , together with thrombin and insulin , of ouabain , up to a concentration of 10 mM , known to inhibit completely the Na + / K + - ATPase , did not affect the pHi increase measured after 15 min ( not shown ) . This suggests that the growth factor - induced alkalinization in CC139 cells is a direct conse - quence of the activation of the Na + / H + antiport . What is the molecular mechanism underlying this activa - tion ? We have recently shown4 that growth factors modify , in CC139 cells , the pH ; sensitivity of the Na + / H + exchanger . The same observation , by an independent method , has been reported in human fibroblasts ( 5 ) . Thus , mitogens likely in - duce a conformation change of the exchange system , the nature of which is not yet known . In this regard , the transient acidification observed in the Na + / H + - deficient mutant after addition of growth factors ( Fig . 5 ) is interesting . It might reflect the stimulation by mitogens of some H + - releasing reaction ( s ) that could be of some importance in the Na * / H + exchange activation . Further investigation is obviously needed to elucidate this point . What is the importance of the growth factor - induced alka - linization in the mitogenic response ? Since an increase of intracellular pH has been found to be associated with activa - tion of cellular functions in a variety of biological systems ( see Ref . 26 for review ) , pHi has been postulated to act as a regulatory signal . Reinitiation of DNA synthesis in quiescent CC139 cells seems indeed to be tightly linked with pHi . This conclusion is supported by the following observations . 1 ) Concentration dependence for thrombin is similar for both pHi increase and stimulation of DNA synthesis ( Fig . 8 ) , and blockade of thrombin ' s active site abolishes both effects ( Ta - ble I ) . 2 ) Inhibition of the Na + / H + antiport parallels the inhibition of mitogen - induced DNA synthesis ( 13 ) . 3 ) In a bicarbonate - free medium , growth factors fail to promote growth of the Na + / H + - deficient mutant PS120 , at neutral and acidic pH , values . ' Therefore , in summary , the Na + / H + antiport is quite essen - tial for both pHi regulation and growth factor action in fibroblasts , in a bicarbonate - free medium . In contrast , in the presence of CO2 , some other mechanism must play the major role in pHi regulation , since , in a HCO ; / CO , - buffered me - dium , growth of the mutant PS120 is not significantly im - paired . ' Actually , preliminary results indicate that CC139 cells possess also a Cl - / HCO ; exchange system that is also likely to play an important role in pHi regulation . Study of this system is presently in progress . Acknowledgments - We are grateful to Dm . E . Van Obberghen - Schilling and J . C . Chambard for their critical reading of the manu - script and G .
