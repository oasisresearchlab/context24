Understanding this is crucial to predict pathogen spread and 3 the effectiveness of control efforts . Most analyses of contact patterns to date have focussed on high - 4 income settings . 5 Methods : Here , we conduct a systematic review and individual - participant meta - analysis of surveys 6 carried out in low - and middle - income countries and compare patterns of contact in these settings to 7 surveys previously carried out in high - income countries . Using individual - level data from 28 , 503 8 participants and 413 , 069 contacts across 27 surveys we explored how contact characteristics ( number , 9 location , duration and whether physical ) vary across income settings . 10 Results : Contact rates declined with age in high - and upper - middle - income settings , but not in low - 11 income settings , where adults aged 65 + made similar numbers of contacts as younger individuals and 12 mixed with all age - groups . Across all settings , increasing household size was a key determinant of 13 contact frequency and characteristics , but low - income settings were characterised by the largest , 14 most intergenerational households . A higher proportion of contacts were made at home in low - 15 income settings , and work / school contacts were more frequent in high - income strata . We also 16 observed contrasting effects of gender across income - strata on the frequency , duration and type of 17 contacts individuals made . 18 Conclusions : These differences in contact patterns between settings have material consequences for 19 both spread of respiratory pathogens , as well as the effectiveness of different non - pharmaceutical 20 interventions . 21 Funding : This work is primarily being funded by joint Centre funding from the UK Medical Research 22 Council and DFID ( MR / R015600 / 1 ) . 23 24 .

Together , these patterns give rise to complex social networks 29 that influence disease dynamics ( Eubank et al . , 2004 ; Ferrari et al . , 2006 ; Firth et al . , 2020 ; Zhang et 30 al . , 2020 ) , including the capacity for emergent pathogens to become endemic ( Ghani and Aral , 2005 ; 31 Jacquez et al . , 1988 ) , the overdispersion of the offspring distribution underlying the reproduction 32 number ( Delamater et al . , 2019 ) and the threshold at which herd - immunity is reached ( Fontanet and 33 Cauchemez , 2020 ; Mistry et al . , 2021 ) . They can similarly modulate the effectiveness of non - 34 pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) , such as school closures and workplace restrictions , that are 35 typically deployed to control and contain the spread of infectious diseases ( Prem et al . , 2020 ) . 36 37 Social contact surveys provide insight into the features of these networks , which is typically achieved 38 through incorporating survey results into mathematical models of infectious disease transmission 39 frequently used to guide decision making in response to outbreaks ( Chang et al . , 2021 ; Davies et al . , 40 2020 ) . Such inputs are necessary for models to have sufficient realism to evaluate relevant policy 41 questions . However , despite the known importance of contact patterns as determinants of the 42 infectious disease dynamics , our understanding of how they vary globally remains far from complete . 43 Reviews of contact patterns to date have focussed on High - Income countries ( HICs ) ( Hoang et al . , 44 2019 ) . This is despite evidence that social contact patterns differ systematically across settings in ways 45 that have material consequences for the dynamics of infectious disease transmission and the 46 evolution of epidemic trajectories ( Prem et al . , 2017 ; Walker et al . , 2020 ) . Previous reviews has also 47 primarily explored the total number of contacts made by individuals ( Hoang et al . , 2019 ) and / or how 48 these contacts are distributed across different age / sex groups ( Horton et al . , 2020 ) . Whilst these 49 factors are a vital component underpinning disease spread , recent work has also underscored the 50 .

Alongside previously published data from HICs ( Kwok et al . , 2018 , 2014 ; Leung 56 et al . , 2017 ; Mossong et al . , 2008 ) , we collate individual participant data ( IPD ) on social contacts from 57 published work spanning 27 surveys from 22 countries and over 28 , 000 individuals . We use a Bayesian 58 framework to explore drivers and determinants of contact patterns across a wider range of settings 59 and at a more granular scale than has previously been possible . Specifically , we assess the influence 60 of key factors such as age , gender and household structure on both the total number and 61 characteristics ( such as duration , location and type ) of contact made by an individual , and explore how 62 the comparative importance of different factors varies across different settings . We additionally 63 evaluate the extent and degree of assortativity in contact patterns between different groups , and how 64 this varies across settings . 65 66 Results 67 Systematic Review and Individual - Participant - Data ( IPD ) Meta - analysis 68 A total of 3 , 409 titles and abstracts were retrieved from the databases , and 313 full - text articles were 69 screened for eligibility ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . This search identified 19 studies with suitable contact 70 data from LIC , LMIC and UMIC settings – individual - level data were obtained from 16 of these studies , 71 including one study from a LIC , six studies from a LMIC and nine studies from an UMIC . These were 72 analysed alongside four HIC studies from Hong Kong and Europe . Details of the identified studies and 73 a full description of the systematic review findings can be found in Supplementary Text 1 and 74 Supplementary Table 1 . In total , this yielded 28 , 503 participants reporting on 413 , 069 contacts . All 75 .

Availability of 76 other variables analysed here for each study are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . All studies reported 77 the number of contacts made in the past 24 hours of ( or day preceding ) the survey . The definitions of 78 contacts were broadly similar across studies ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Specifically , contacts were 79 defined as skin - to - skin ( physical ) contact or a two - way conversation in the physical presence of 80 another person . All studies scored above 65 % of the items on the AXIS risk of bias tool , suggesting 81 good or fair quality ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Among all participants 47 . 5 % were male , 30 . 1 % were 82 aged under 15 years and 7 . 2 % were aged over 65 years . The majority ( 83 . 4 % ) of participants were 83 asked to report the number of contacts they made on a weekday . A large proportion ( 34 . 1 % ) of 84 respondents lived in large households of 6 or more people but this was largely dependent on income 85 setting ( LIC / LMIC = 63 . 2 % , UMIC = 35 . 9 % , HIC = 4 . 9 % ) . Among school - aged children ( 5 to 18 years ) , 88 . 1 % 86 were students , and 59 . 1 % of adults aged over 18 were employed . 87 88 Total number of contacts and contact location 89 The median number of contacts made per day across all the studies was 9 ( IQR = 5 - 17 ) , and was similar 90 across income strata ( LIC / LMIC = 10 [ 5 - 17 ] , UMIC = 8 [ 5 - 16 ] , HIC = 9 [ 5 - 17 ] ; Table 1 ) . There was a large 91 variation in contact rates across different studies , with the median number of daily contacts ranging 92 from 4 in a Zambian setting ( Dodd et al . , 2015 ) to 24 in an online Thai survey ( Stein et al . , 2014 ) . When 93 stratifying by study methodology , median daily contacts was higher in diary - based surveys compared 94 to interview - / questionnaire - based surveys , which was true across all income strata ( Table 1 , 95 Supplementary Figure 2 ) . 96 97 Overall , children aged 5 to 15 had the highest number of daily contacts ( Figure 1A - C ) , although there 98 was substantial variation between studies and across income - strata in how the number of daily 99 contacts varied with age ( Figure 1A - C ) . Across UMICs and HICs , the number of daily contacts made by 100 participants decreased with age , with this decrease most notable in the oldest age - groups ( adjCRR for 101 .

By contrast , there was no 102 evidence of contact rates declining in the oldest age - groups in LICs / LMICs ( adjCRR for 65 + vs . < 15 years 103 [ 95 % CrI ] = 0 . 94 [ 0 . 89 - 1 . 00 ] ) . We observed contrasting effects of gender on the number of daily 104 contacts , with men making more daily contacts compared to women in LICs / LMICs after accounting 105 for age ( adjCRR = 1 . 17 , 95 % CrI : 1 . 15 - 1 . 20 ; Figure 1D ) , but no effect of gender on total daily contacts for 106 other income strata ( CRR [ 95 % CrI ] : UMIC = 1 . 01 [ 0 . 98 - 1 . 04 ] , HIC = 0 . 99 [ 0 . 97 - 1 . 02 ] ) . There were also 107 differences in the number of daily contacts made according to the methodology used and whether 108 the survey was carried out on a weekday or over the weekend – in both instances , contrasting effects 109 of these factors on the number of daily contacts according to income strata were observed ( Figures 110 1D - 1F ) . 111 112 We also examined the influence of factors that might influence both the total number and location 113 ( home , work , school and other ) of the contacts individuals make . Across all income - strata , students 114 ( defined as those currently in education , attending school and aged between 5 and 18 years ) made 115 more daily contacts than non - students aged between 5 and 18 ( adjCRR [ 95 % CrI ] : LIC / LMIC = 1 . 26 [ 1 . 16 - 116 1 . 37 ] , UMIC = 1 . 18 [ 1 . 03 - 1 . 35 ] and HIC = 1 . 54 [ 1 . 42 - 1 . 66 ] ; Figure 1D - F ) . Similarly , we observed strong and 117 significant effects of employment in all income strata , with adults who were employed having a higher 118 number of total daily contacts compared to those not in employment ( adjCRR [ 95 % CrI ] : LIC / LMIC = 119 1 . 17 [ 1 . 12 - 1 . 23 ] , UMIC = 1 . 07 [ 1 . 03 - 1 . 13 ] , HIC = 1 . 60 [ 1 . 54 - 1 . 65 ] ; Figure 1D - F ) . Total daily contacts 120 increased with household size ( Figure 2A , Supplementary Figure 2 ) across all income - strata ; 121 individuals living in large households ( 6 + members ) had 1 . 47 ( 95 % CrI : 1 . 32 - 1 . 64 ) ( LIC / LMICs ) , 2 . 58 122 ( 95 % CrI : 2 . 37 - 2 . 80 ) ( UMICs ) and 1 . 51 ( 95 % CrI : 1 . 40 - 1 . 63 ) ( HICs ) times more daily contacts than those 123 living alone , after accounting for age and gender ( Figure 1E - F ) . Sensitivity analyses excluding additional 124 contacts ( as defined in Methods ) , showed little difference in effect sizes , and were strongly correlated 125 with the effect sizes shown in Figure 1D - F ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . 126 127 .

Contact location 129 was known for 314 , 235 contacts , 42 . 7 % of which occurred at home ( 13 . 1 % at work , 12 . 5 % at school 130 and 31 . 7 % in other locations ) . Across income - strata , there was significant variation in the proportion 131 of contacts made at home – being highest in LICs / LMICs ( 68 . 3 % ) and lowest in HICs ( 37 . 0 % ) ( Figure 132 2B ) . Age differences were also observed in the number of contacts made at home , particularly for 133 LICs / LMICs ( Figure 2C - 2D ) . Relatedly , a higher proportion of contacts occurred at work and school 134 ( 14 . 6 % and 11 . 3 % ) in HICs compared to LICs / LMICs ( 3 . 9 % and 5 . 2 % , respectively ; Supplementary 135 Figure 4 ) . Strong , gender specific patterns of contact location were also observed . Across all income 136 strata males made a higher proportion of their contacts at work compared to females , although this 137 difference was largest for LICs / LMICs ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Further , we found significant variation 138 between income strata in median household size ( 7 in LICs / LMICs , 5 in UMICs and 3 in HICs ) . This trend 139 of decreasing household size with increasing country income was consistent with global data ( Figure 140 2E ) . The larger households observed for LIC / LMIC settings were also more likely to be 141 intergenerational – in LICs / LMICs , 59 . 4 % of participants aged over 65 lived in households of at least 6 142 members compared to 17 . 5 % in UMICs and only 2 . 2 % in HICs . 143 144 Type and duration of contact 145 Data on the type of contacts ( physical and non - physical ) were recorded for 20 , 910 participants . The 146 mean percentage of physical contacts across participants was 56 . 0 % and was the highest for 147 LICs / LMICs ( 64 . 5 % ) . At the study level , the highest mean percentage of physical contacts was observed 148 for a survey of young children and their caregivers conducted in Fiji ( Neal et al . , 2020 ) ( 84 . 0 % ) and the 149 lowest in a Hong Kong contact survey ( Leung et al . , 2017 ) ( 18 . 9 % ) . Physical contact was significantly 150 less common among adults compared to children under 15 years in all settings ( ORs ranged between 151 0 . 22 to 0 . 48 ) ( Figure 3A - F ) . Despite the proportion of physical contacts generally decreasing with age , 152 there was a higher proportion observed for adults aged 80 or over ( Figure 3A - C ) . Contacts made by 153 .

Most 156 physical contacts made by women in LICs were made at home ( 73 . 5 % ) , whilst for HICs this was just 157 41 . 4 % - similar differences across income - strata were observed for men , although the proportions 158 were always lower than observed for women ( 62 . 4 % for LIC / LMICs and 36 . 4 % for HICs ) . Increasing 159 household size was generally associated with a higher proportion of contacts being physical ( for 160 households of 6 + members compared to 1 member : adjCRR [ 95 % CrI ] : LIC / LMIC = 1 . 73 [ 1 . 48 - 2 . 02 ] , 161 UMIC = 1 . 30 [ 1 . 12 - 1 . 52 ] , HIC = 1 . 57 [ 1 . 48 - 1 . 67 ] ; Figure 3D - F ) . Employment was associated with having a 162 significantly lower proportion of physical contacts in LICs / LMICs ( adjOR = 0 . 83 , 95 % CrI : 0 . 79 - 0 . 87 ) and 163 HICs ( adjOR = 0 . 71 , 95 % CrI : 0 . 69 - 0 . 73 ) , but not in UMICs ( adjOR = 1 . 11 , 95 % CrI : 1 . 03 - 1 . 19 ) . The 164 proportion of physical contacts among all contacts was the highest for households ( 70 . 4 % ) , followed 165 by schools ( 58 . 5 % ) , community ( 55 . 7 % ) and work ( 33 . 6 % ) ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . 166 167 Data on t he duration of contact ( < 1 or ≥1hr ) were available for 22 , 822 participants . The percentage of 168 contacts lasting at least 1 hour was 63 . 2 % and was highest for UMICs ( 76 . 0 % ) and lowest for 169 LICs / LMICs ( 53 . 1 % ) . Across both UMICs and HICs , duration of contacts was lower in individuals aged 170 over 15 years compared to those aged 0 - 15 , with the extent of this disparity most stark for HICs ( for 171 ages 65 + compared to < 15 years : adjCRR [ 95 % CrI ] : LIC / LMIC = 0 . 61 [ 0 . 57 - 0 . 64 ] , UMIC = 0 . 61 [ 0 . 58 - 0 . 65 ] , 172 HIC = 0 . 35 [ 0 . 33 - 0 . 37 ] ; Figure 4A - F ) . We observed contrasting effects of gender across income - strata : 173 males made longer - lasting contacts than females in UMICs ( adjOR = 1 . 11 , 95 % CrI = 1 . 08 - 1 . 14 ) ; Figure 174 4D - F ) , but not in LIC / LMICs ( adjOR = 0 . 92 , 95 % CrI = 0 . 90 - 0 . 95 ) or HICs ( adjOR = 0 . 98 , 95 % CrI = 0 . 97 - 1 . 00 ) . 175 Participants reported shorter contacts on weekends compared to weekdays in LICs / LMICs 176 ( adjOR = 0 . 91 , 95 % CrI : 0 . 88 - 0 . 95 ) , and HICs ( adjOR = 0 . 95 , 95 % CrI : 0 . 92 - 0 . 97 ) , but not in UMICs 177 ( adjOR = 1 . 12 , 95 % CrI = 1 . 03 - 1 . 21 ) . Contacts lasting over an hour as a proportion of all contacts was 178 highest for households ( 72 . 7 % ) , followed by schools ( 67 . 9 % ) , community ( 47 . 0 % ) and work ( 44 . 0 % ) . 179 .

For all income strata , the 181 proportion of contacts > 1h increased with increasing household size ( Figure 4D - F ) . 182 183 Assortativity by age and gender 184 Twelve studies collected information on the gender of the contact and eight studies contained 185 information on age allowing assignment of contacts to one of the three age - groups described in 186 Methods ( Supplementary Table 2 , Supplementary Text 2 ) . We found evidence to suggest that contacts 187 were assortative by gender for all income strata , as participants were more likely to mix with their 188 own gender ( Supplementary Text 2 ) . Mixing was also assortative by age , with participants more likely 189 to contact individuals who belonged to the same age group this degree of age - assortativity was lowest 190 for LICs / LMICs , where only 29 % of contacts made by adults were with individuals of the same age 191 group . By contrast , in HICs we observed a higher degree of assortative mixing , with most contacts 192 ( 51 . 4 % ) made by older adults occurring with individuals belonging to the same age group . 193 194 Discussion 195 Understanding patterns of contact across populations is vital to predicting the dynamics and spread 196 of infectious diseases , as well understanding the control interventions likely to have the greatest 197 impact . Here , using a systematic review and individual - participant data meta - analysis of contact 198 surveys , we summarise research exploring these patterns across a range of populations spanning 199 28 , 503 individuals and 22 countries . Our findings highlight substantial differences in contact patterns 200 between income settings . These differences are driven by setting - specific sociodemographic factors 201 such as age , gender , household structure and patterns of employment , which all have material 202 consequences for transmission and spread of respiratory pathogens . 203 .

This is 204 consistent with previous results from HICs ( Béraud et al . , 2015 ; Fu et al . , 2012 ; Hoang et al . , 2019 ; 205 Ibuka et al . , 2016 ; Lapidus et al . , 2013 ) and shown here to be generally true for LICs / LMICs and UMICs 206 also . Interestingly however , we observed differences in patterns of contact in adults across income 207 strata . Whilst contact rates in HICs declined in older adults , this was not observed in LICs / LMICs , where 208 contact rates did not differ in the oldest age - group compared to younger ages . This is consistent with 209 variation in household structure and size across settings , with nearly two thirds of participants aged 210 65 + in included LIC / LMIC surveys living in large , likely intergenerational , households ( 6 + members ) , 211 compared to only 2 % in HICs . HICs were also characterised by more assortative mixing between age - 212 groups , with older adults in LICs / LMICs more likely to mix with individuals of younger ages , again 213 consistent with the observed differences between household structures across the two settings . These 214 results have important consequences for the viability and efficacy of protective policies centred 215 around shielding of elderly individuals ( i . e . those most at risk from COVID - 19 or influenza ) in these 216 settings . 217 Our results support the idea of households as a key site for transmission of respiratory 218 pathogens ( Thompson et al . , 2021 ) , with the majority of contacts made at home . However , its relative 219 importance compared to other locations is likely to vary across settings . Our results highlighted 220 significant differences across income settings in the distribution of contacts made at home , work and 221 school . The proportion of contacts made at home was highest for LIC / LMICs , where larger average 222 household sizes were associated with more contacts , more physical contacts , and longer lasting 223 contacts . By contrast , participants in HICs tended to report more contacts occurring at work and 224 school . The lower number of contacts at work in LIC / LMIC may be explained by the types of 225 employment ( e . g agriculture in rural surveys ) and a selection bias ( women at home / homemakers 226 more likely to be surveyed in questionnaire - based surveys ) . Such differences would have 227 consequences for which locations contribute most to transmission and in turn modulate the efficacy 228 of different NPIs , such as workplace closures . Our analyses similarly highlighted significant variation in 229 .

Contacts made by female participants in 230 LICs / LMICs were more likely to be physical compared to men , whilst the opposite effect was observed 231 for HICs and UMICs , potentially reflecting context - specific gender roles . In all settings , we observed a 232 general decline of physical contacts with age , except in the very old ( Mossong et al . , 2008 ) , potentially 233 reflecting higher levels of dependency and the need for physical care . 234 There are important caveats to these findings . Data constraints limited the numbers of factors we 235 were able to explore – for example , despite evidence ( Kiti et al . , 2014 ) suggesting that contact patterns 236 differ across rural and urban settings , only 3 studies ( Kiti et al . , 2014 ; O . le Polain de Waroux et al . , 237 2018 ; Neal et al . , 2020 ) contained information from both rural and urban sites , allowing classification . 238 Similarly , we were unable to examine the impact of socioeconomic factors such as household wealth , 239 despite experiences with COVID - 19 having highlighted strong socio - economic disparities in both 240 transmission and burden of disease ( De Negri et al . , 2021 ; Routledge et al . , 2021 ; Ward et al . , 2021 ; 241 Winskill et al . , 2020 ) and previous work suggesting that poorer individuals are less likely to be 242 employed in occupations amenable to remote working ( Loayza , 2020 ) . A lack of suitably detailed 243 information in the studies conducted precludes analysis of these factors but highlights the importance 244 of incorporating economic questions into future contact surveys , such as household wealth and house 245 square footage . Other factors also not controlled for here , but that may similarly shape contact 246 patterns include school holidays or seasonal variations in population movement and composition that 247 we are unable to capture given the cross - sectional nature of these studies . 248 Another important limitation to the results presented here is that we are only able to consider a 249 limited set of contact characteristics ( the location and duration of the contact and whether it was 250 physical ) . Previous work has highlighted the importance of these factors in determining the risk of 251 respiratory pathogen transmission ( Chang et al . , 2021 ; Dunne et al . , 2018 ; Olivier le Polain de Waroux 252 et al . , 2018 ; Neal et al . , 2020 ; Thompson et al . , 2021 ) , but only a limited number of studies reported 253 whether a contact was “close” or “casual” ( Kwok et al . , 2018 , 2014 ; O . le Polain de Waroux et al . , 2018 ) 254 .

More generally , the relevance and 256 comparative importance of different contacts to transmission likely varies according to the specific 257 pathogen and its predominant transmission modality ( e . g . aerosol , droplet , fomite etc ) . It is therefore 258 important to note that these results do not provide a direct indication of explicit transmission risk , but 259 rather an indicator of factors likely to be relevant to transmission . Relatedly , it is also important to 260 note that the studies collated here were all conducted prior to the onset of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . 261 Previous work has documented significant alterations to patterns of social contact in response to 262 individual - level behaviour changes or government implemented NPIs aimed at controlling SARS - CoV - 263 2 spread , but detailed analysis of changing contact patterns is contingent on both an understanding 264 of baseline contact patterns as detailed in the studies collated here as well as longitudinal sampling of 265 how contacts patterns change over time , which is available for only a limited number of settings ( Jarvis 266 et al . , 2021 , 2020 ; Liu et al . , 2021 ) . Description of contact location was also coarse and precluded more 267 granular analyses of specific settings , such as markets , which have previously been shown to be 268 important locations for transmission in rural areas ( Grijalva et al . , 2015 ) . 269 Heterogeneity between studies was larger for LICs / LMICs and UMICs , which we partly accounted for , 270 through fitting random study effects . These study differences may be attributed to the way individual 271 contact surveys were conducted , making comparisons of contact patterns among surveys more 272 difficult ( e . g . prospective / retrospective diary surveys , online / paper questionnaires , face - to - 273 face / phone interviews , and different contact definitions ) . For instance , there is evidence suggesting 274 that prospective reporting , which is less affected by recall bias , can often lead to a higher number of 275 contacts being reported ( Mikolajczyk and Kretzschmar , 2008 ) and a lower probability of casual or 276 short - lasting contacts being missed . The relatively high contact rates observed in HICs may be 277 explained by the fact that all but two HIC surveys used diary methods . Our study highlights that a 278 unified definition of “contact” and standard practice in data collection could help increase the quality 279 of collected data , leading to more robust and reliable conclusions about contact patterns .

Whilst some of these factors will 283 be correlated with a country’s income status ( e . g . household size ( Walker et al . , 2020 ) ) , many others 284 however will be unique to a particular setting or geographical area or correlate only weakly with 285 country - level data . Examples include patterns of employment , the role of women , and other 286 contextual factors . These analyses are therefore intended primarily to provide indications of prevailing 287 patterns , rather than a definitive description of contact patterns in a specific context and highlight the 288 significant need for further studies to by carried out in a diversity of different locations . 289 Despite these limitations however , our results highlight significant differences in the structure and 290 nature of contact patterns across settings . These differences suggest that the comparative importance 291 of different locations and age - groups to transmission will likely vary across settings and have critical 292 consequences for the efficacy and suitability of strategies aimed at controlling the spread of 293 respiratory pathogens such as SARS - CoV - 2 . Most importantly , our study highlights the limited amount 294 of work that has been undertaken to date to better understand and quantify patterns of contact across 295 a range of settings , particularly in lower - and middle - income countries , which is vital in informing 296 control strategies reducing the spread of such pathogens . 297 298 Methods 299 Systematic Review 300 Data sources and search strategy : Two databases ( Ovid MEDLINE and Embase ) were searched on 26 th 301 May 2020 to identify studies reporting on contact patterns in LICs , LMICs and UMICs ( Supplementary 302 Table 4 ) . Collated records underwent title and abstract screening for relevance , before full - text 303 screening using pre - determined criteria . Studies were included if they reported on any type of face - 304 to - face or close contact with humans and were carried out in LICs , LMICs or UMICs only . No restrictions 305 .

Studies were excluded if they did not report 307 contacts relevant to air - borne diseases ( e . g . sexual contacts ) , were conducted in HICs , were contact 308 tracing studies of infected cases , or were conference abstracts . All studies were screened 309 independently by two reviewers ( AM and CW ) . Differences were resolved through consensus and 310 discussion . The study protocol can be accessed through PROSPERO ( registration number : 311 CRD42020191197 ) . Income group classification ( LIC / LMIC , UMIC , or HIC ) was based on 2019 World 312 Bank data ( fiscal year 2021 ) ( World Bank Group , 2020 ) . 313 314 Data extraction : Individual - level data were obtained from publication supplementary data , as well as 315 online data repositories such as Zenodo , figshare and OSF . When not publicly available , study authors 316 were contacted to request data . Extracted data included the participant’s age , gender , employment , 317 student status , household size and total number of contacts , as well as the day of the week for which 318 contacts were reported . Some studies reported information at the level of individual contacts and 319 included the age , gender , location and duration of the contact , as well whether it involved physical 320 contact . Individual - level data from HICs , not systematically identified , were used for comparison , and 321 included three studies from Hong Kong ( Kwok et al . , 2018 , 2014 ; Leung et al . , 2017 ) and the 8 European 322 countries from the POLYMOD study ( Mossong et al . , 2008 ) . Data were collated , cleaned and 323 standardised using Stata version 14 . Country - specific average household size were obtained from the 324 United Nations Database on Household Size and Composition ( United Nations Department of 325 Economic and Social Affairs Population Division , 2019 ) . Gross domestic product based on purchasing 326 power parity ( GDP PPP ) was obtained from the World Data Bank database ( World Bank International 327 Comparison Programme , 2021 ) . Findings are reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting 328 Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) checklist of items specific to IPD meta - 329 analyses ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS critical appraisal tool used 330 to evaluate quality of cross - sectional studies ( Downes et al . , 2016 ) , modified to this study’s objectives 331 .

Each item was attributed a zero or a one , and a quality score was assigned 332 to each study , ranging from 0 % ( “poor” quality ) to 100 % ( “good” quality ) . The individual - level data 333 across all studies and analysis code are available at https : / / github . com / mrc - ide / contact _ patterns ( see 334 Supplementary Text 3 for data dictionary ) . 335 336 Statistical analysis 337 The mean , median and interquartile range of total daily unique contacts were calculated for subgroups 338 including country income status , individual study , survey methodology ( diary - based or 339 questionnaire / interview - based ) , survey day ( weekday / weekend ) , and respondent characteristics such 340 as age , sex , employment / student status and household size . Detailed description of data assumptions 341 for each study can be found in Supplementary Text 3 . 342 343 A negative binomial regression model was used to explore the association between the total number 344 of daily contacts and the participant’s age , sex , employment / student status and household size , as 345 well as methodology and survey day . Incidence rate ratios from these regressions are referred to as 346 “Contact Rate Ratios” ( CRRs ) . A sensitivity analysis was carried out that excluded additional contacts 347 ( such as additional work contacts , group contacts , and number missed out , which were recorded 348 separately and in less detail by participants compared to their other contacts ( Ajelli and Litvinova , 349 2017 ; Kumar et al . , 2018 ; Leung et al . , 2017 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) ) . Logistic regressions were used to 350 explore determinants of contact duration ( < 1hr / 1hr + ) and type ( physical / non - physical ) , using the 351 same explanatory variables as in the total contacts analyses . The proportion of contacts made at each 352 location ( home , school , work and other ) was explored descriptively and contacts made with the same 353 individual in separate locations / instances were considered as separate contacts . 354 355 All analyses were done in a Bayesian framework using the probabilistic programming language Stan , 356 using uninformative priors in all analyses and implemented in R via the package brm s ( Bürkner , 2018 , 357 .

All analyses were stratified by three income strata ( LICs and LMICs were combined to preserve 358 statistical power ) and included random - study effects , apart from models adjusting for methodology 359 which did not vary by study . The effect of each factor was explored in an age - and gender - adjusted 360 model . All models exploring the effect of student status or employment status were restricted to 361 children aged between 5 and 18 years and adults over 18 , respectively . In the remaining models 362 including all ages , age was adjusted as a categorical variable ( < 15 , 15 to 65 and over 65 years ) . CRRs , 363 Odds Ratios ( ORs ) and their associated 95 % Credible Intervals are presented for all regression models . 364 Here , we report estimates adjusted for age and gender ( referred to as adjCRR or adjOR ) . Studies which 365 collated contact - level data were used to assess assortativity of mixing by age and gender for different 366 country - income strata by calculating the proportions of contacts made by participants that are male 367 or female and those that belong to three broad age groups ( children , adults , and older adults ; 368 Supplementary Text 2 ) . 369 370 Ethics statement 371 All original studies included were approved by an institutional ethics review committee .
