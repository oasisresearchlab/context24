In this study we report on the detection of the autologous antibody response to putative oncogene , human cortactin using serological analysis of breast carcinoma expression library . Cortactin maps to chromosome 11q13 , the region ampliﬁed in about 15 % of primary breast carcinomas and 30 % of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas . Cortactin overexpression due to such ampliﬁcation might a(cid:128)ect adhesive properties of human cancer cells and is associated with poor disease prognosis . Accordingly , we detected overexpression of cortactin transcript in autologous tumor and ampliﬁca - tion / overexpression of cortactin in tumors of breast cancer patients serologically positive for this marker . We demonstrate that 15 % of breast cancer patients elicit humoral immune response against human cortactin . Oncogene ( 2000 ) 19 , 5204 – 5207 . Keywords : breast cancer ; cortactin ; cancer antigen ; tumor marker The development of cancer vaccines requires the identiﬁcation and characterization of tumor antigens . In the past decade many tumor antigens have been deﬁned ( reviewed by Old and Chen , 1998 ; Rosenberg , 1999 ) . In 1991 T Boon and colleagues discovered the ﬁrst antigen recognized by cytotoxic T - lymphocytes ( CTL ) in human melanoma ( van der Bruggen et al . , 1991 ) . In their study tumor antigens have been identiﬁed by the transfection of cDNA libraries into cells expressing the appropriate MHC molecule followed by the identiﬁca - tion of transfectant using cytokine release or lysis by human T cells with speciﬁc antitumor reactivity ( Boon et al . , 1994 ) . An alternative technique for the identiﬁcation of tumor antigens has been reported by Sahin et al . ( 1995 ) . This approach of serological analysis of cDNA expression libraries ( SEREX ) , was based on previously described molecular screening techniques ( D’Arpa et al . , 1988 ) and exploited patient’s B - cell repertoire for the identiﬁcation of human tumor antigens that show immunogenicity in the autologous host . Many antigens have been isolated by this technique , demonstrating that most , if not all , human cancers express multiple antigens including ampliﬁed / overexpressed proteins with known cancer association ( reviewed by Old and Chen , 1998 ; Disis and Cheever , 1996 ; Brass et al . , 1999 ) . In this study we applied the SEREX method to isolate and characterize candidate tumor antigens expressed in breast carcinoma . A cDNA library in phage expression vector ( lambda ZAP Express ) was prepared from a surgical tumor specimen of a 56 - year - old woman with ER - positive breast carcinoma ( T 1 M 0 N 0 ) . The library was plated and screened with autologous patient’s serum diluted 1 : 200 as previously described ( Scanlan et al . , 1998 ) .

For sequence alignment BLASTN program was used * Correspondence : MA Lagarkova Received 20 January 2000 ; revised 31 July 2000 ; accepted 1 August 2000 positive clones representing 57 distinct antigens . Sequence analysis revealed that one of the positive clones – MOBr - 140 represents human cortactin ( Figure 1 ) . The clone MOBr - 140 is a partial transcript of cortactin gene lacking 504 bp of the complete cDNA at the 5 ’ - region and 1189 bp of 3 ’ - untranslated region . The deduced amino acid sequence of MOBr - 140 represents human cortactin from amino acid residue 112 – 550 , which is about 80 % of entire protein sequence ( Figure 1b ) . This region , which apparently includes the epitope recognized by B cells , contains an SH3 domain at the C - terminus and ﬁve and - a - half tandemly repeated copies of 37 amino acid residues ( out of six and - a - half present in the full - size cortactin protein ) that are believed to mediate binding of cortactin to ﬁlamentous actin in vitro . No evidence of mutations in this region was found in clone MOBr - 140 as compared to published cortactin gene sequence ( Schuuring et al . , 1993 , 1998 ) . Human cortactin is a p80 / p85 multidomain actin ﬁlament - binding protein ( Schuuring et al . , 1993 ) ﬁrst identiﬁed as a src kinase substrate in chicken ﬁbroblasts ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Cortactin is involved in the signaling pathway of mitogenic receptors and adhesion molecules mediating cytoskeletal reorganiza - tion ( Schuuring et al . , 1993 , 1998 ; van Damme et al . , 1997 ; Campbell et al . , 1999 ) . Human cortactin maps to the chromosomal band 11q13 which is known to be ampliﬁed in about 15 % of primary breast carcinomas and 30 % of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( Schuuring , 1995 ; Meredith et al . , 1995 ; Hui et al . , 1998 ) . Such ampliﬁcation has been also reported for other malignancies , including ovarian and bladder cancer ( Bringuier et al . , 1996 ) . Ampliﬁcation of cortactin in breast and head and neck carcinomas is associated with poor clinical outcome . ( Meredith et al . , 1995 ; Schuuring et al . , 1992 , 1995 ; Hui et al . , 1998 ) . Additionally , recent studies have shown the over - expression of cortactin in NIH3T3 cells to result in increased cell invasion / migration in vitro ( Patel et al . , 1998 ; Huang et al . , 1998 ) . Moreover , cortactin takes part in formation and function of invadopodias in Figure 2 Analysis of ampliﬁcation and overexpression of cortactin in breast cancer tumor samples . ( a ) Northern blot analysis of cortactin expression in autologous breast tumor . Lane 1 represents 1 m g of poly ( A ) + mRNA from breast carcinoma tissue used for preparation of cDNA expression library ; lane 2 , 1 m g of poly ( A ) + mRNA from normal mammary gland ( Clontech , USA ) . 32 P - labeled 1 . 3 kb Bam HI fragment of the insert of the clone MOBr - 140 was labeled by random priming ( Amersham , USA ) and used as hybridization probe under stringent conditions ( 68 8 C ) in Rapid Hyb bu(cid:128)er ( Amersham , USA ) . ( b , c ) Cortactin ampliﬁcation / overexpression in tumor samples of breast cancer patients . Southern blot analysis ( b ) and Northern blot analysis ( c ) of DNA and RNA from 12 breast cancer tumor samples . Ten m g of DNA digested with Eco RI was transferred to nylon membrane for Southern analysis and 15 m g of total RNA was used for Northern analysis with the hybridization probe described in ( a ) . Lane 1 represents DNA / RNA from normal mammary gland , lanes 2 – 13 represent DNA / RNA from breast cancer tumor samples . Lanes 8 and 12 represent DNA and RNA from patients with positive antibody response to cortactin . Hybridizations with human lymphotoxin alpha ( Southern analysis ) and beta - actin ( Northern analysis ) are shown as loading controls Oncogene Antibody response against cortactin in breast cancer MA Lagarkova et al 5205 invasive breast cancer cell line ( Bowden et al . , 1999 ) supporting the hypothesis of direct involvement of cortactin in metastasis . To examine the level of cortactin expression in tumor tissue used as the source of mRNA for preparation of the library , Northern blot analysis was performed . The results shown in Figure 2a demonstrate about sixfold overexpression of cortactin transcript in tumor tissue as compared to normal mammary gland tissue . Although overexpression of gene products in cancer can be caused by increased mRNA life span , increased protein stability , or gene ampliﬁcation ( Disis and Cheever , 1996 ) , recent studies indicated that cortactin mRNA overexpression was associated pre - dominantly with gene ampliﬁcation in some carcino - mas ( Hui et al . , 1998 ) . Unfortunately , DNA from autologous breast cancer tissue was unavailable for our study . We therefore analysed DNA and RNA samples from additional 12 tumor samples of breast cancer patients ( Figure 2b , c ) . Two of these 12 patients had humoral immunological response against cortactin ( samples # # 8 and 12 ) . Two out of two tumor samples from patients serologically positive for cortactin showed both the ampliﬁcation of the cortactin gene ( Figure 2b ) and the overexpression of cortactin mRNA ( Figure 2c ) , while none of 10 tumors from patients without antibody response showed signs of ampliﬁcation or overexpression . In order to estimate the frequency of the immune response against human cortactin in cancer patients sera samples from normal donors and cancer patients were tested for their reactivity against expression clone MOBr - 140 ( Table 1 ) . None of the sera from normal donors age - matched with cancer patients showed reactivity , while about 15 % of breast cancer sera elicited the immune response against this antigen . Three out of 11 sera of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma also reacted with the clone MOBr - 140 . Additionally , one out of 20 ovarian cancer sera , one out of 25 renal cancer sera but not sera from lung cancer or melanoma , tested positive for MOBr - 140 ( Table 1 ) . Thus , human cortactin appears to display a cancer - restricted immunological proﬁle and may be considered as a putative cancer antigen . Moreover , the results of screening of the clone MOBr - 140 with a panel of breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma sera are in good agreement with published data on average frequency of cortactin gene ampliﬁcation in primary breast carcino - ma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( Hui et al . , 1998 ; Meredith et al . , 1995 ) . Human immune response to oncogenic proteins has been reported in several studies ( Disis and Cheever , 1996 ) and our ﬁndings add human cortactin to this list . Further studies using larger panels of sera and tumor specimens is required to determine whether the presence of antibodies against this gene product in sera of cancer patients correlates with the tumor type and prognosis and could be valuable in cancer diagnostics .
