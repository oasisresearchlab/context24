DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 04535 1 of 17 Figure 1 . Tracking procedure . ( A ) The rational behind our approach . The centroid positions of endocytic proteins were correlated with the plasma membrane intermediates derived from CLEM ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . We could thus position the protein complexes along the plasma membrane invagination to reconstruct the molecular architecture of the endocytic machinery . ( B ) A yeast cell expressing the coat protein Sla2 tagged N - terminally ( GFP - Sla2 ) and a collection of trajectories of GFP - Sla2 centroid in different endocytic events . The trajectories are oriented so that the plasma membrane lies horizontally at the bottom and the inward movement axis is vertical . The triangle and the square mark the start and the end of each trajectory , respectively . ( C ) The information content of the GFP - Sla2 average trajectory : The average trajectory movement on the focal plane . The trajectory is aligned so that the Y - axis represents the inward movement along the invagination and the X - axis represents the movement along the plasma membrane ( left panel ) . The inward movement of the trajectories over time ( right panel ) . The number of molecules recruited at the endocytic site over time ( bottom panel ) . The 55 individual trajectories that were used to generate this average are plotted ( gray ) together with the average ( blue ) . The contour lines highlight point densities . ( D ) A yeast cell expressing GFP - Sla2 and the reference protein Abp1 - mCherry and a collection of trajectories derived from the simultaneous acquisition of the target and reference proteins . ( E ) A diagram summarizing the steps that led to the spatial and temporal alignment of the average trajectories . Abp1 is used as the spatial and temporal reference . The average trajectory of the target protein ( GFP - Sla2 in this example ) is aligned to the average trajectory of Abp1 - GFP ( the reference protein ) by aligning each of them to the respective trajectories acquired simultaneously in cells expressing GFP - Sla2 and Abp1 - mCherry . More than 50 endocytic events are used to derive the average spatial and temporal transformation that aligns the average trajectories together . The shading represents the confidence interval ( See ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Scale bars in images are 1 μ m long . See also Figure 1—figure supplements 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .

Average trajectories of endocytic events . ( A – G ) The average trajectories and the individual trajectories that were used to generate the average trajectories are shown together . The contour lines highlight point densities . The distribution of the individual trajectories is unimodal confirming that the dynamics of the proteins investigated in this study do not show substantial heterogeneity during the process of endocytosis . The shading represents the confidence interval . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 04535 . 004 Picco et al . eLife 2015 ; 4 : e04535 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 04535 3 of 17 Biophysics and structural biology | Cell biology Figure 1—figure supplement 2 . Experimental controls for the alignment procedure . ( A ) Lifetimes of Abp1 patches in strains expressing Abp1 - mCherry and a target protein labeled with GFP were used to control the functionality of the tagged proteins . Only Las17 - GFP strain showed a significant difference in Abp1 patch lifetime ( pvalue < 0 . 05 ) . Error bars represent the SE . ( B ) The time required by Abp1 - GFP to reach its peak in fluorescence intensity . This gives an estimate of the time needed to invaginate the plasma membrane ( Figure 2A – C ) . The time distribution is unimodal and normal ( Shapiro – Wilk test of normality , p value = 0 . 07 , H 0 : the distribution is normal . ) ( C ) The movement of Abp1 centroid was used as a reference for the alignment of the trajectories of different endocytic proteins . Its movement is on average directed perpendicularly to the plasma membrane . The histogram shows the distribution of angles between the vector representing the direction of movement of Abp1 trajectories ( blue arrow ) and the vector tangent to the plasma membrane ( red arrow ) . Mean angle is given as mean ± SEM . ( D ) Yeast cells were imaged at the equatorial plane therefore the invagination movement is projected on the focal plane . An endocytic event imaged at the edge of a depth of field of 500 nm ( dashed lines , right plot ) would induce a maximal underestimation of 0 . 5 % of the invagination movement in a yeast cell of 2 . 5 μ m in radius . ( E ) Repeated alignments of the same average trajectories ( Abp1 - GFP , Rvs167 - GFP and GFP - Sla2 ) using five independent data sets of simultaneous two color acquisitions ( Abp1 - mCherry - GFP , Rvs167 - GFP with Abp1 - mCherry , and GFP - Sla2 with Abp1 - mCherry ) . σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of the five alignments in time and space respectively . The shading represents the confidence interval . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 04535 . 005 Picco et al . eLife 2015 ; 4 : e04535 .

( A – D ) Lag τ , rotation T θ , and translations , T x and T y , that align a virtual trajectory to its virtual reference . The trajectory and its reference were generated already aligned and the expected values are 0 for each component of the transformation . The transformation was computed 30 times , each time using 100 trajectory pairs that were generated randomly from the virtual trajectory and the virtual reference with equal incremental values of σ p and σ r . σ p and σ r indicate respectively the standard deviation used to generate the trajectories for the target and for the reference protein in each trajectory pair . ( E – H ) The average values for τ , T θ , T x and T y , computed as in ( A – D ) with incremental values of σ p . σ r is kept 19 nm , which is the noise we encountered experimentally for the reference trajectory in the trajectory pairs . ( I – N ) The average values for τ , T θ , T x and T y , computed as in ( E – H ) but the position of the trajectory of the target protein is 30 nm away from the reference . The error bars represent the standard deviation of the distributions . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 04535 . 006 Picco et al . eLife 2015 ; 4 : e04535 .

Simulation of the robustness to systematic shifts between the two channels during two color acquisition . ( A ) The shift from its correct position of a trajectory aligned to its reference in the presence of systematic color aberration . Each point shows the mean and standard deviation of 30 repeats of the alignment . Each alignment was computed using 100 pairs of virtual trajectories each of which was generated with σ p = 16 nm , for the trajectory of the target protein , and σ r = 19 nm , for the trajectory of the reference protein . The reference trajectories were systematically shifted along one direction with incremental color shifts , which are reported along the X - axis . ( B ) As in ( A ) but with the real trajectory pairs that we acquired for Abp1 - mCherry and Sla2 - GFP . Those trajectory pairs were used to align Sla2 - GFP to Abp1 - GFP . The trajectories of Abp1 - mCherry are shifted along one direction in all the trajectory pairs used to compute the alignment of Sla2 - GFP . The error bars represent the confidence interval for the position of Sla2 - GFP . ( C – D ) Examples of Sla2 - GFP trajectories aligned using trajectory pairs affected by different color shifts . The shading represents the confidence interval . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 04535 . 007 Picco et al . eLife 2015 ; 4 : e04535 .

( A ) The average trajectory computed from 65 virtual trajectories that were generated from a trajectory template ( ground truth trajectory , shown in red ) adding noise normally distributed around the points of the ground truth trajectory with σ = 10 nm . The trajectories were aligned in space and time to compute the averaged together . The average trajectory was then aligned to its reference using 100 trajectory pairs that were generated from the ground truth trajectory , with noise σ p = 10 nm and from the reference trajectory , with noise σ r = 19 nm . The average trajectory is compared with the ground truth trajectory shown in red , after the alignment . ( B – D ) Same as ( A ) but with σ = 13 nm , σ = 17 nm and σ = 20 nm respectively .

( A ) A schematic cartoon to show how local photobleaching would affect the centroid position of a fluorescent actin patch , given three possible scenarios for the nucleation of new actin filaments ( in red ) at the endocytic locus : ( 1 ) New actin filaments are nucleated in the proximity of the coat ; photobleaching would shift the centroid away from the plasma membrane . ( 2 ) New filaments are nucleated at the base of the plasma membrane invagination ; photobleaching would shift the centroid toward the plasma membrane . ( 3 ) There is no preferential direction for actin nucleation ; photobleaching would not affect the centroid position .

The actin filament network is drawn schematically to illustrate the average direction of actin polymerization and does not represent the true organization of the actin filaments and branches . Time ≤ − 8 s : coat assembly ; Sla2 exposes its actin binding domain outside of the clathrin cage . Time ≈ − 8 s : actin polymerization starts and drives the initiation of the plasma membrane invagination . − 8 s ≤ time ≤ − 3 s : the invagination grows and the coat accommodates the changes in curvature imposed by the plasma membrane invagination growth . − 3 s ≤ time < 0 s : Rvs proteins are recruited to the invagination , which is growing longer , and stabilize it . Time ≥ 0 : the scission of the invagination releases the vesicle . Concomitantly , the Rvs structure starts to disassemble very rapidly . See also Video 2 .
