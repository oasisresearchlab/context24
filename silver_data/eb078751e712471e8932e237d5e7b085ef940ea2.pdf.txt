Numerous pathogens exploit the phagocytic process and actin cytoskeleton to infect host cells . Coxiella burnetii , the etiologic agent of Q fever , is internalized by host cells through a molecular mechanism that is poorly understood . Methodology / PrincipalFinding : Here we analyzed the role of different cortactin motifs in the internalization of C . burnetii by non - phagocytic cells . C . burnetii internalization into HeLa cells was significantly reduced when the cells expressed GFP - cortactin W525K , which carries a mutation in the SH3 domain that renders the protein unable to bind targets such as N - WASP . However , internalization was unaffected when the cells expressed the W22A mutant , which has a mutation in the N - terminal acidic region that destroys the protein’s ability to bind and activate Arp2 / 3 . We also determined whether the phosphorylation status of cortactin is important for internalization . Expression of GFP - cortactin 3F , which lacks phosphorylatable tyrosines , significantly increased internalization of C . burnetii , while expression of GFP - cortactin 3D , a phosphotyrosine mimic , did not affect it . In contrast , expression of GFP - cortactin 2A , which lacks phosphorylatable serines , inhibited C . burnetii internalization , while expression of GFP - cortactin SD , a phosphoserine mimic , did not affect it . Interestingly , inhibitors of Src kinase and the MEK - ERK kinase pathway blocked internalization . In fact , both kinases reached maximal activity at 15 min of C . burnetii infection , after which activity decreased to basal levels . Despite the decrease in kinase activity , cortactin phosphorylation at Tyr421 reached a peak at 1 h of infection . Conclusions / Significance : Our results suggest that the SH3 domain of cortactin is implicated in C . burnetii entry into HeLa cells . Furthermore , cortactin phosphorylation at serine and dephosphorylation at tyrosine favor C . burnetii internalization . We present evidence that ERK and Src kinases play a role early in infection by this pathogen . Citation : Rosales EM , Aguilera MO , Salinas RP , Carminati SA , Colombo MI , et al .

Furthermore , phagocytosis represents a crucial event that triggers host defense mechanisms against invading pathogens . Nevertheless , several pathogens have acquired different strategies to alter these mechanisms to survive and multiply within host cell , causing infectious diseases [ 1 , 2 ] . The phagocytic process is initiated by a recognition step in which ligands on the particle surface bind receptors on the membrane of host cells [ 3 ] . The ligand - receptor interaction leads to actin cytoskeleton and membrane rearrangements that permit , first , particle engulfment and , later , particle sequestration into a phagosome which precedes phagosome maturation into a phagolysosome [ 4 , 5 ] . Dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is not only intimately involved in phagocytosis [ 6 ] but also in other essential cellular processes , including cell adhesion and motility [ 7 ] , vesicle transport [ 8 , 9 ] , apoptosis [ 10 ] and endocytosis [ 11 ] , all of which require dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton . There are numerous actin - associated proteins and several upstream signaling molecules that work in a coordinated way to control with exquisite precision the spatial and temporal assembly of actin structures , which can rapidly change in response to internal and external signals [ 12 , 13 ] . Proteins of the Arp2 / 3 complex that function as nucleators of branched actin filaments are activated by interaction with members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family and cortactin [ 14 , 15 ] . Initial activation of WASP depends on its interaction with Rho family GTPases [ 9 ] . These multicom - ponent complexes of Arp2 / 3 - WASP - cortactin are involved in cellular processes such as cell motility [ 16 ] , endocytosis [ 17 ] and PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39348 phagocytosis [ 18 , 19 ] . Interestingly , some pathogens can regulate the host actin cytoskeleton during infection [ 20 , 21 ] . Cortactin is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton , and it plays a crucial role in tumor cell invasion [ 22 ] , ruffles and lamellipodium formation during integrin - mediated cell adhesion [ 23 , 24 ] and podosome formation [ 25 ] . Cortactin is also an important component of the endocytic machinery [ 26 ] . It has emerged as a common target of pathogen - host cell interactions . For example , cortactin has been implicated in the adhesion of Escherichia coli [ 27 ] and in invasion by Shigella , Neisseria , Chlamydia , Staphylococcus and Listeria . The phosphorylation status of cortactin has been proposed to differentially regulate the invasion of many microbial pathogens . Cortactin is also involved in actin - based motility of many pathogens during their intracellular trafficking [ 28 ] . Cortactin possesses an N - terminal acidic domain ( NTA ) and F - actin - binding repeats that activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to initiate actin polymerization [ 29 ] . Cortactin also has a proline - serine - threonine - rich region ( PST ) that contains tyrosine residues critical for cortactin function . The C - terminal SH3 domain of cortactin binds various proteins , such as N - WASP proteins [ 30 , 31 ] . The Verprolin Cofilin Acidic domain ( VCA ) of WASP members can also activate the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 32 ] . Theoretically N - WASP , cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex can form ternary complexes [ 32 ] . Cortactin is phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases ( Src , Fer , Syk and Abl ) and serine / threonine kinases ( ERK and Pak ) in response to a wide range of stimuli that induce cytoskeletal rearrangement , including growth factor stimulation , cell adhesion and hyperos - motic stress [ 33 ] . Coxiella burnetii , the causative agent of human Q fever , is an obligate intracellular bacterium found in a wide range of hosts , including livestock and humans . The primary route of infection in humans is inhalation of contaminated aerosols [ 34 , 35 ] . Infected animals shed C . burnetii in their milk , urine and feces , and the bacteria are dispersed together with amniotic fluids and the placenta during birthing . These bacteria can survive for long periods in the environment , since they are highly resistant to heat , desiccation and common disinfectants . C . burnetii inhabits mainly monocytes / macrophages but can infect a wide variety of cultured cell lines in vitro [ 36 ] . This bacterium resides in an acidic parasitophorous vacuole ( PV ) with late endosome - lysosome characteristics [ 37 – 39 ] . The PV also interacts with the autophagic pathway , acquiring autophagosomal features [ 37 , 38 , 40 ] . Interestingly , we have shown that PV biogenesis is regulated by actin and Rho family GTPases [ 41 ] . In this report we describe the involvement of cortactin in C . burnetii internalization into HeLa cells , a non - professional phagocyte cell line . We investigated the role of the Arp2 / 3 - activating DDW motif in the N - terminal acidic region and of the SH3 domain at the C - terminus of cortactin during C . burnetii internalization . We observed that overexpression of cortactin mutated in the SH3 domain inhibits uptake of the bacterium , suggesting that the SH3 domain is important for internalization . We also analyzed the role of cortactin phosphorylation in internalization . By overexpressing cortactin mutants that are non - phosphorylatable and that mimic phosphorylation , we show that cortactin favors C . burnetii internalization in a tyrosine dephosphorylation - and / or serine phosphorylation - dependent manner . Furthermore , pharmacological inhibition of Src and ERK kinases reduce C . burnetii uptake . Our results indicate that phosphorylation status of cortactin affect internalization of C . burnetii .

Results The SH3 Domain of Cortactin is Important for C . burnetii Internalization Cortactin is an F - actin regulatory protein that plays an important function in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion , motility and endocytosis . However , its role in phagocy - tosis has been poorly characterized . Interestingly , cortactin is recruited to the contact sites made by several pathogens with the host plasma membrane during infection [ 28 ] . In its N - terminal acidic region ( NTA ) , cortactin contains a short motif called DDW that binds and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 29 ] . This motif is followed by 6 . 5 tandem repeats of a 37 - residue sequence responsible for F - actin binding . It has a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain at the C - terminus that mediates the interaction with various proteins , including the Arp2 / 3 - stimu - lating Wiscott - Aldrich protein N - WASP [ 43 ] . These interactions link actin remodeling to several specific processes . Mutations in cortactin that abrogate Arp2 / 3 activation ( W22A ) or SH3 domain binding function ( W525K ) have been described [ 44 , 45 ] . To analyze the role of the different cortactin motifs in C . burnetii internalization , we tested two cortactin mutants : W22A ( 20DDW22 motif mutated to 20DDA22 ) , an NTA mutant that has lost its ability to bind and activate Arp2 / 3 [ 29 ] ; and W525K , an SH3 mutant that is unable to bind certain targets such as N - WASP [ 30 ] . HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP - cortactin WT , GFP - cortactin W22A or GFP - cortactin W525K , infected with C . burnetii at 37 u C for 4 h , processed for indirect immunofluorescence and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy ( see Methods ) . We decided to allow 4 h for C . burnetii internalization in order to detect the intracellular bacteria with sufficient resolution . To quantify C . burnetii internalization by immunofluorescence we used the conventional double cycle antibody staining protocol for discriminate between extra - and intracellular bacteria ( see Methods ) . In the Fig . 1A ( panels d , h , l and p ) , extracellular bacteria present double staining ( green and red pseudocolors ) while intracellular ones present single staining ( red pseudocolor ) . The intracellular bacteria are expressed as a percentage of the total number of bacteria per cell ( Fig 1B and 1A , panels c , g , k and o ) . As shown in Fig . 1B , in cells expressing GFP - cortactin W525K , C . burnetii internalization was significantly lower than that observed in cells expressing GFP alone . In contrast , expression of the W22A mutant did not affect C . burnetii internalization . These results suggest that the SH3 domain of cortactin is critical for C . burnetii entry into HeLa cells . Figure 1 . The SH3 domain of cortactin is important for C . burnetii internalization . ( A ) HeLa cells were transfected with pGFP - cortactin WT , GFP - cortactin W22A , a mutant that does not interact with Arp 2 / 3 , or GFP - W525K , a mutant unable to bind and activate targets such as N - WASP .

Src kinases and other Tyr kinases phosphor - ylate human cortactin predominantly at three sites in vitro , Tyr421 , Tyr470 and Tyr486 ( corresponding to Tyr421 , Tyr466 and Tyr482 in murine cortactin ) , while ERK and PAK phosphorylate Ser405 / Ser418 and Ser113 , respectively [ 23 , 26 , 30 , 46 – 48 ] . In addition to that , c - Met and Fer kinases can phosphorylate cortactin on tyrosine residues [ 47 , 49 ] . The combined mutation of Tyr421 , Tyr466 , and Tyr482 abolishes tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of cortactin in cells under various conditions [ 46 , 49 ] . Thus , these Src phosphorylation sites have been the focus of functional characterization . At the same time , several mass spectrometry - phosphoproteomic studies have identified additional phosphory - lated tyrosine residues [ 50 , 51 ] . A number of individual phospho - tyrosine sites have been reported independently in different cell types and in response to diverse stimuli , but their regulation and function remain to be investigated . A validated tool to study the role of phosphorylation is to use non - phosphorylatable and phospho - mimetic mutants . To determine whether tyrosine phos - phorylation plays a role in internalization , HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP - cortactin 3F ( Y421 , 466 , 482F ) , which encodes a cortactin that cannot be phosphorylated by Src on tyrosines . Transfected HeLa cells were infected with C . burnetii at 37 u C for 4 h , processed for indirect immunofluorescence and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy . As shown in Fig . 2A , the levels of C . burnetii internalization were similar in cells expressing either GFP ( control ) or GFP - cortactin WT , but significantly higher in cells expressing GFP - cortactin 3F . In contrast , when HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding pGFP - cortactin 3D ( Y421 , 466 , 482D ) , which mimics cortactin phosphorylated by Src , internalization of C . burnetii was similar to that in cells expressing GFP - cortactin WT ( Fig . 2B ) . These results suggest that C . burnetii internalization is favored when cortactin is dephosphorylated . A Non - serinephosphorylatable Cortactin Mutant Inhibits C . burnetii Internalization Since the cellular function of cortactin is also regulated by phosphorylation of its serine residues , we studied whether serine phosphorylation is important for C . burnetii internalization . HeLa cells were transfected with pGFP , pGFP - cortactin WT , pGFP - cortactin 2A or pGFP - cortactin SD . Cortactin 2A ( S405 , 418A ) cannot be phosphorylated by ERK , while cortactin SD ( S405 , 418D ) mimics the effects of ERK phosphorylation . As shown in Fig . 2C , expression of the ERK - phosphorylation mimic of cortactin led to internalization similar to that in cells expressing GFP or cortactin WT . Interestingly , the cortactin mutant not phosphorylatable by ERK inhibited internalization , indicating that cortactin phosphorylation on serine residues is important for internalization . These results suggest that serine phosphorylation of cortactin regulates internalization of C . burnetii during infection . Src and ERK Kinases are Involved in C . burnetii Internalization Given that dynamic phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine residues in cortactin is involved in C . burnetii uptake and that Figure 2 . Cortactin mutants not phosphorylatable by Src and ERK stimulated and inhibited C . burnetii internalization , respectively . HeLa cells were transfected with pGFP , pGFP - cortactin WT ( wild type ) or plasmids encoding GFP fusions with one of the following cortactin mutants : ( A ) pGFP - cortactin 3F , a Src non - phosphorylatable mutant ; ( B ) pGFP - cortactin 3D , which mimics cortactin phosphorylated by Src ; or ( C ) pGFP - cortactin 2A , an ERK non - phosphorylatable mutant , or pGFP - cortactin SD , which mimics cortactin phosphorylated by ERK .

HeLa cells were treated during infection with Src kinase inhibitor SU6656 or with PD98059 , an inhibitor of MEK kinases which are upstream activators of ERK kinases [ 52 , 53 ] . Fig . 3A shows extracellular bacteria ( panels a , c and e ) and total bacteria ( panels b , d and f ) in untreated or inhibitor - treated cells . Quantification of internalized bacteria is shown in Fig . 3B . Both inhibitors significantly blocked internalization . Similar inhibition of the C . burnetii uptake was observed during infection of a macrophage cell line treated with the MEK kinase inhibitor ( Fig . S1A and B ) . These results suggest that kinases of the Src and ERK families are involved in C . burnetii internalization . C . burnetii Induces Phosphorylation of Cortactin on Tyr421 During Infection Several pathogens have been found to modify the phosphory - lation status of cortactin during their interaction with host cells [ 28 ] . To determine whether C . burnetii causes cortactin phosphor - ylation during infection , we examined the phosphorylation status of Tyr421 after different infection periods . HeLa cells were infected with C . burnetii for different periods of time , and clarified lysates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting using an antibody that specifically recognizes cortactin phosphorylated on Tyr421 . Fig . 4A shows that the maximal level of phospho - Tyr421 cortactin was observed at 1 h of infection with live bacteria . Similar cortactin phosphorylation levels were observed during infection of a phagocytic cell ( Fig . S2B ) . In contrast , the level of this form of phosphorylated cortactin did not change significantly when the infection was carried out with heat - killed C . burnetii ( Fig . 4B ) . These results suggest that C . burnetii induces phosphorylation of cortactin on Tyr421 early during infection . Src and ERK Kinases are Activated During C . burnetii Infection Considering that cortactin is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and that it is a substrate of Src kinase , we reasoned that this enzyme may be activated during C . burnetii infection . To investigate this possibility , clarified lysates of HeLa cells infected with C . burnetii were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting using an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho - Src ( pTyr416 ) , the activated form of the kinase . Fig . 5 shows the levels of activated Src and total Src . Src was activated early during infection , within 15 min , after which the level of activated enzyme decreased to basal levels . This result suggests that Src kinase is activated early during C . burnetii - host cell interaction . Cortactin can also be regulated by phosphorylation of serine residues and ERK is one kinase involved in this reaction . To investigate whether ERK is activated during C . burnetii infection , lysates of infected HeLa cells were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting using an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated ERK . As shown in Fig . 6 , ERK was activated at 15 min of infection . Similarly , the phosphorylation in ERK was observed during infection of a phagocytic cell ( Fig . S2A ) . This result suggests that ERK , similar to Src kinase , is activated early during C . burnetii - host cell interaction . Discussion Bacterial pathogens manipulate the host cell cytoskeleton to avoid phagocytosis , to invade and / or to become mobile in the host cell cytoplasm . They often interact with actin filaments by modulating the activity of different actin - interacting effectors in the host . One such effector is cortactin , an actin - binding protein Figure 3 .

Cortactin has been implicated in the infection process of several microbial pathogens [ 28 ] . The present study contributes to understanding the role of cortactin in bacterial pathogenesis . We provide evidence that the SH3 domain and serine phosphorylation of cortactin are involved in signal transduction pathways that support the internalization of avirulent C . burnetti into non - phagocytic cells , whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin suppresses this internalization . We also show that Src and ERK kinases are activated during the initial stages of C . burnetti infection . Cortactin stimulates actin polymerization by binding , via its N - terminal domain , the Arp2 / 3 complex , or by binding , through its C - terminal SH3 domain , N - WASP , a well - known activator of Arp2 / 3 [ 28 , 30 ] . We report here that expression in HeLa cells of the cortactin mutant W525K , which carries a mutation in the C - terminal SH3 domain , significantly inhibited C . burnetii internal - ization ( Fig . 1 ) , suggesting an important role for this domain in bacterial entry . We hypothesize that avirulent C . burnetii requires minor modification of the actin cytoskeleton at the plasma membrane to be internalized , so we propose that SH3 domain - mediated recruitment of N - WASP ( and then Arp2 / 3 ) is sufficient to stimulate actin assembly and bacterial uptake . Our results are similar to those observed in the formation of the pedestal - like structure during E . coli infection . Indeed , expression of the cortactin mutant W525K significantly reduced the number of pedestals induced by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) or enterohemorrhagic E . coli ( EHEC ) in HeLa cells [ 27 , 54 ] . In addition , cell motility can be regulated by cortactin through its C - terminal SH3 domain independently of the presence of the N - terminal portion which is consistent with the ability of the SH3 domain on its own to stimulate N - WASP and actin polymerization in vitro [ 30 ] . Cortactin cleavage by calpain has also been shown to be important for cell migration [ 55 ] . Cells expressing a calpain - resistant cortactin showed reduced migration and increased membrane protrusion . This phenotype was reverted by expression of a calpain - resistant cortactin with the W525K mutation , which suggests that the SH3 domain of cortactin is required for the stimulation of membrane protrusions . N - WASP activation depends on the phosphorylation status of serine and tyrosine residues in the C - terminal domain of cortactin [ 30 ] . Expression of a non - serine - phosphorylatable cortactin mutant impairs pedestal formation in cells infected with EPEC or EHEC [ 54 ] . These results suggest that ERK phosphorylation of cortactin contributes to pedestal formation . In HeLa cells expressing the same cortactin mutant we observed significant inhibition of bacterial uptake ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus , similarly to pedestal formation induced by E . coli , entry of C . burnetii into HeLa cells requires serine phosphorylation of cortactin . Our conclusion is also supported by the observations that ERK1 / 2 kinases were transiently activated early during HeLa cell infection and then later deactivated ( Fig . 6 ) , and that HeLa cell treated with the inhibitor of MEK - dependent ERK1 / 2 activation showed a reduction in C . burnetii internalization ( Fig . 3 ) . In our experimental model , expression of a non - tyrosine - phosphorylatable cortactin mutant increased C . burnetii internali - zation ( Fig . 2 ) . However , pedestal formation induced by EPEC was reduced in HeLa cells expressing the same mutant [ 54 , 56 ] . Moreover , we observed cortactin phosphorylation on Tyr421 at 1 h of infection with C . burnetii , after which the phosphorylation returned to basal levels ( Fig . 4 ) . Similar kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation - dephosphorylation were observed in HeLa cells infected with pre - activated EHEC [ 57 ] . In vitro experiments have shown that cortactin phosphorylated by Src does not interact with and activate N - WASP , which leads to inhibition of pedestal formation [ 30 , 57 ] . Based on these results , we can speculate that during C . burnetii infection of HeLa cells , cortactin must be dephosphorylated on its tyrosine residues in order to interact with N - WASP , leading to actin remodeling and bacterial internaliza - tion . At the same time , tyrosine dephosphorylation of cortactin increases its actin - crosslinking activity in vitro [ 58 ] . Therefore , cortactin dephosphorylated on its tyrosine residues may cross - link Figure 5 . Tyrosine phosphorylation of Src kinase during the C . burnetii infection .

Cortactin can be tyrosine - phosphorylated not only by Src kinases but also by Abl kinases [ 59 ] . Abl kinases can be activated by autophosphorylation and by phosphorylation by Src family kinases [ 60 , 61 ] . We observed that Src kinase was activated at 15 min of infection and then the levels of activated enzyme decreased to basal levels ( Fig . 5 ) , while cortactin was phosphor - ylated on Tyr421 at 1 h of infection . We also observed that the pharmacological Src inhibitor decreased C . burnetii internalization ( Fig . 3 ) . While these observations may be due to the direct action of Src kinase on cortactin , they may also be due to the action of Abl kinase , activated by Src . Internalization of Chlamydia trachomatis also involves cortactin , and this protein is phosphorylated at 1 h of infection by Abl kinases but not Src [ 62 ] . Shigella entry into host cells also requires activation of Abl kinases [ 63 ] . Therefore we speculate that during C . burnetii infection , Abl kinases are activated to phosphorylate cortactin . On the other hand , the strong effect of the chemical inhibition of Src kinase could indicate that other Src substrates apart from cortactin might participate in C . burnetii entry . We show here that during C . burnetii infection , Src is transiently activated and then inactivated , and cortactin is tyrosine - phos - phorylated and then dephosphorylated . We detected that C . burnetii entry induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin at early time points , with a maximum peak around 60 min ( Fig . 4 ) . In addition to that , we found that the 3F cortactin mutant with non - phosphorylatable tyrosines enhances C . burnetii entry at 4 h after infection ( Fig . 2 ) . This seems to indicate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is required at the initial steps while it would inhibit entry at later time points . These processes are similar to those observed during infection of gastric epithelial cells by Helicobacter pylori . This pathogen promotes an early but transient phosphorylation of cortactin . The infected cells become scattered and elongated , and this phenotype depends on Src phosphoryla - tion of CagA ( a protein secreted by a type IV secretion system ) , which inactivates c - Src and leads to cortactin dephosphorylation by an unknown mechanism [ 64 ] . It is tempting to speculate that C . burnetii internalization occurs by a mechanism similar to that of H . pylori . To our knowledge , C . burnetii , H . pylori and EHEC are the only three pathogens known to induce dephosphorylation of cortactin during host cell infection . Recently , H . pylori has been shown to induce cortactin phosphorylation on serines in a CagA - independent manner , and this form of cortactin stimulates actin rearrangement and cell elongation [ 65 ] . We show here that expression of a cortactin mutant lacking phosphorylatable serines inhibited C . burnetii internalization , which suggests that serine phosphorylation of cortactin is necessary for C . burnetii entry . THP - 1 monocytes infected with virulent C . burnetii exhibit intense membrane protrusions associated with major actin cytoskeleton reorganization , while infection with avirulent bacteria induced a few membrane folds without significantly affecting cell morphology [ 66 ] . Although it was not the focus of the present study , we think that the membrane folds stimulated by avirulent C . burnetii result from a modest actin cytoskeleton rearrangement that facilitates bacterial uptake . Meconi and collaborators also showed that actin cytoskeleton reorganization is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the Src family kinases Hck and Lyn very early during infection of THP - 1 cells with virulent , but not avirulent , C . burnetii [ 67 ] . In the present study , using an anti - phospho - Src antibody that recognizes several members of the Src family , including Hck and Lyn , we found that Src was activated early during infection with avirulent bacteria . Meconi et al . also found , using an anti - phosphoTyr monoclonal Ab , that virulent C . burnetii , but not avirulent bacteria , stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins . Using a similar experimental strategy , we observed a significant labeling of proteins with masses around 85 kDa at 1 h of HeLa infection with avirulent C . burnetii ( data not shown ) . Cortactin migrates as a doublet of 80 and 85 kDa in SDS - PAGE [ 68 , 69 ] . We cannot rule out the possibility that the differences between our results and those of Meconi et al . are due to the different cell types used . In conclusion , our results indicate that serine phosphorylation of cortactin and its SH3 domain are involved in a signal transduction mechanism that favors C . burnetii uptake , while tyrosine phosphor - ylation suppresses this uptake . Our results suggest that a complex series of events occurs during C . burnetii internalization into non - phagocytic cells . Early after infection , Src and ERK kinases may phosphorylate unknown substrates , perhaps other kinases such as Abl that in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues in cortactin . This may regulate an early step in internalization . At a later stage , tyrosine dephosphorylation and serine phosphorylation of cortac - tin take place , which regulates a later step of internalization . In this way , tyrosine phosphatases and serine kinases from the host cell and / or C . burnetti regulate the phosphorylation status of cortactin to favor C . burnetti entry into the host cell . Thus , the results reported here indicate that dynamic phosphorylation of cortactin is important for C . burnetii internalization during infection .
