Within the KMN network , Spc105 acts as an 16 interaction hub of components involved in spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) signaling . 17 It is known that Spc105 forms a complex with kinetochore component Kre28 . However , 18 where Kre28 physically localizes in the budding yeast kinetochore is not clear . The 19 exact function of Kre28 at the kinetochore is also unknown . Here , we investigate how 20 Spc105 and Kre28 interact and how they are organized within bioriented yeast 21 kinetochores using genetics and cell biological experiments . Our microscopy data show 22 that Spc105 and Kre28 localize at the kinetochore with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry . We also 23 show that the Kre28 - Spc105 interaction is important for Spc105 protein turn - over and 24 essential for their mutual recruitment at the kinetochores . We created several truncation 25 mutants of kre28 that affect Spc105 loading at the kinetochores . When over - expressed , 26 these mutants sustain the cell viability , but SAC signaling and kinetochore biorientation 27 are impaired . Therefore , we conclude that Kre28 contributes to chromosome 28 biorientation and high - fidelity segregation at least indirectly by regulating Spc105 29 localization at the kinetochores . 30 31 32 Introduction 33 During eukaryotic cell division , kinetochores facilitate faithful segregation of genetic 34 material from mother to daughter cells . Each kinetochore is a large protein machine that 35 assembles on a specialized chromatin domain called the centromere and establishes 36 end - on attachments between the sister chromatids and spindle microtubules emanating 37 from opposite spindle poles . The budding yeast S . cerevisiae has one of the ‘simplest’ 38 kinetochores known to date . Yet , it harbors ~ 70 protein subunits . Components of the 39 yeast kinetochore can be divided into two main categories . The first category contains 40 the centromeric DNA binding components and their associated network , known as 41 CCAN ( constitutive centromere associated network ) . The second comprises the 42 microtubule - binding protein network : the KMN supercomplex , the fungi - specific Dam1 43 complex , and the microtubule plus - end binding protein Stu2 [ 1 - 5 ] . The budding yeast 44 kinetochore incorporates each of these proteins positioned at well - defined average 45 locations along the kinetochore - microtubule attachment ( Figure 1A and S1B , [ 6 , 7 ] ) . For 46 molecular and cell biologists , the budding yeast kinetochore serves as an excellent 47 model to determine the mechanisms underlying kinetochore functions . 48 Spc105 is an essential kinetochore protein that gets co - purified with COMA complex 49 subunit Mcm21 and with MIND complex ( Mtw1 - Nsl1 - Nnf1 - Dsn1 ) [ 8 , 9 ] . It forms a 50 complex with another essential kinetochore protein , Kre28 , also known as Ydr532C . 51 Kre28 is an orthologue of human Zwint1 , C . elegans Kbp - 5 , and S . pombe Sos7 [ 9 - 12 ] . 52 Previous studies , using in - vitro and in - vivo experiments , provide some insights into how 53 Spc105 and Kre28 are assembled at the kinetochores . Still , the specific function of 54 Kre28 remains unclear . How Kre28 localizes within the kinetochore - microtubule 55 attachment site is also unknown [ 13 - 15 ] . Here we define the localization of Kre28 in 56 kinetochore - microtubule attachment sites of bioriented kinetochores and elucidate its 57 functional role . 58 59 Results 60 Localization of Kre28 in the KMN network of bioriented kinetochores . 61 We have previously shown that the precise organization and alignment of Spc105 can 62 influence proper SAC activation and silencing [ 16 - 19 ] . Kre28 , being an essential 63 component of the kinetochore , may also contribute to the incorporation of Spc105 into 64 the yeast kinetochore . Zwint1 , the human orthologue of Kre28 , localizes very close to 65 Cdc20 at the human kinetochores [ 20 , 21 ] . Therefore , Kre28 may play a role in 66 determining the Spc105 organization . 67 To determine Kre28’s position with respect to Spc105 , we first had to define the 68 organization of the entire Spc105 protein within the yeast kinetochore . Previous studies 69 show that the C - terminal RWD domain of Spc105 binds directly to the Mtw1 complex 70 and remains in the proximity of Spc24 / Spc25 C - termini [ 14 , 22 , 23 ] . On the other hand , 71 the N - terminus of Spc105 ( abbreviated as N - Spc105 ) consists of a long , disordered 72 phosphodomain that lies somewhere between the Dam1 complex and the C - termini of 73 Ndc80 and Nuf2 within the Ndc80 complex [ 6 , 7 , 24 ] . To map out the overall 74 organization of the Spc105 phosphodomain , we inserted a GFP at locations within 75 Spc105 that demarcate domains predicted to possess secondary structure ( see Fig . 76 S1 ) . Additionally , we tagged three different kinetochore subunits to position mCherry at 77 different locations along the kinetochore - microtubule attachment ( Fig . S1 ) . 78 Quantification of FRET between the GFP inserted in Spc105 and one of the three 79 mCherry acceptors shows that despite being discorded , the Spc105 phosphodomain 80 localization is mainly limited to a span between the Dam1 complex and the C - terminus 81 of the Ndc80 subunit ( abbreviated at Ndc80 - C ) of the Ndc80 complex . The disordered 82 nature of the phosphodomain also gave rise to FRET between different sections of 83 adjacent Spc105 molecules ( Fig . S1D ) . Having established Spc105 , we examined the 84 localization of Kre28 by centroid measurement and FRET assay . Previous literature 85 suggested that the C - terminal structured domains of Spc105 harbor interaction sites for 86 Kre28 [ 25 , 26 ] . 87 To define the localization of Kre28 within the KMN network of bioriented kinetochores , 88 we performed high - resolution colocalization to measure the mean separation between 89 Kre28 - C and the N termini of the Ndc80 subunit ( N - Ndc80 ) in the bioriented 90 kinetochores of yeast ( Figure 1A , [ 7 ] ) . We observed that the C - terminus of Kre28 is 91 positioned between 45 - 50 nm from N - Ndc80 , which is consistent with previously 92 published work with Zwint1 [ 21 ] . 93 To determine Kre28 localization with higher resolution , we quantified FRET between 94 Kre28 - C with either Spc24 - C or Ndc80 - C in metaphase cells . We obtained a low to 95 moderate proximity ratio in both cases , indicating that Kre28 - C may localize somewhere 96 between C - termini of Spc24 and Ndc80 ( Figure 1B ) . The absence of FRET between 97 adjacent Kre28 C termini ( Kre28 - GFP / Kre28 - mCherry ) indicated that the C termini of 98 Kre28 molecules are farther apart than 10nm in metaphase ( Figure 1C ) . We also 99 measured FRET between Kre28 - mCherry and GFP inserted at different positions of 100 Spc105 ( 222 nd , 455 th , 709 th , or the C terminus ) to find that the C termini of Kre28 are 101 proximal of the kinetochore binding RWD domain ( RING finger , WD repeat , DEAD - like 102 helicases ) of Spc105 ( Figure 1D and 1E ) . A previous study suggested that the 103 stoichiometry of Kre28 and Spc105 is 2 : 1 [ 11 ] . However , a comparison of the intensity 104 of Kre28 - GFP or Kre28 - mCherry signal per kinetochore revealed that there is one 105 molecule of Kre28 per Spc105 molecule in bioriented kinetochores of yeast ( Figure S2 106 A - D ) . 107 108 Kre28 interacts with the structured middle domain of Spc105 ( amino acid 507 - 638 ) 109 but not with the kinetochore binding domain . 110 Studies of Zwint1 ( orthologue of Kre28 in humans ) found that it interacts with a domain 111 within amino acid 1980 - 2109 of human Spc105 [ 25 ] . Protein cross - linking experiments 112 also revealed that coiled - coiled domains Kre28 128 – 169 and Kre28 229 – 259 interact with 113 Spc105 551 - 711 , the predicted coiled - coil domain of Spc105 [ 13 ] . We wanted to uncover 114 the domains within both Kre28 and Spc105 that are necessary for their mutual 115 interactions . 116 To study these domains in the ex - vivo condition , we first used the yeast two - hybrid 117 assay . We chose Kre28 fragments ( amino acid 1 - 201 and 202 - 385 , based on predicted 118 secondary structure of Kre28 , 119 http : / / www . compbio . dundee . ac . uk / jpred4 / results / jp _ OMYEJWN / jp _ OMYEJWN . svg . html 120 ) and Spc105 coiled - coil domain ( CC , 455 - 708 ) and the C - terminal RWD domain of 121 Spc105 ( amino acid 709 - 917 [ 14 ] ) ( Also see Figure S3A ) . Both Kre28 FL and Kre28 1 - 201 122 showed interactions with CC as indicated by the growth of colonies co - expressing 123 GBD + spc105 CC , GAD + Kre28 FL , and GBD + spc105 CC , GAD + kre28 1 - 201 in synthetic 124 dextrose plates lacking histidine . Interestingly , we did not see any interactions between 125 Kre28 FL and spc105 CC + RWD ( Figure 2A ) . This may be because of the misfolding of 126 spc105 CC + RWD fusion with the GAL4 binding domain ( GBD _ C1 ) . It is also possible that 127 the RWD domain interferes with the interaction of CC and Kre28 , pointing to a 128 regulatory mechanism . To dissect the interaction between spc105 CC and kre28 1 - 201 129 more thoroughly , we used smaller fragments ( 1 - 126 and 1 - 80 ) for our yeast two - hybrid 130 assay with spc105 CC . We did not notice any interaction using these combinations 131 ( Figure 2A ) . Furthermore , we saw a significant contrast in colony growth between the 132 combinations of spc105 CC + Kre28 FL and that of spc105 CC + kre28 1 - 201 , which denotes a 133 change in the strength of interaction with spc105 CC . In conclusion , our yeast two - hybrid 134 assay data indicated that Spc105 CC binding domain lies within Kre28 127 - 201 . 135 Next , we mapped the Kre28 interacting domain of Spc105 in - vivo . We performed 136 domain mapping experiments where we truncated the mid strand domain of Spc105 137 ( amino acid 313 - 708 ) at different residues based on predicted secondary structure ( Fig . 138 2B ) . We constructed versions of GFP labeled Spc105 with different truncations in the 139 mid strand domain ( Δ 313 - 455 harboring only the unstructured region , Δ 313 - 507 140 containing unstructured region and a small helical domain , Δ 313 - 638 that contains 141 unstructured region and an alpha helix rich domain of CC and Δ 313 - 709 that 142 encompasses the entire mid strand domain , Figure 2B top right ) and transformed them 143 in a heterozygous diploid strain ( AJY3278 , SPC105 / Δ : : NAT ) . We examined the 144 localization of these mutants by microscopy . First , kinetochore localization of Δ 313 - 455 145 and Δ 313 - 507 displayed no discernable difference in localization compared to wild - type 146 ( Figure 2B , right ) . Our nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) analyses ( nls - 147 mapper . iab . keio . ac . jp / cgi - bin / NLS _ Mapper _ y . cgi , see the methods section ) indicated 148 residues of 337 - 345 ( SSNKRRKLD , score 9 . 0 ) and / or that of 599N - 625L ( score 6 . 9 ) 149 contain nuclear localization signals . However , previously we have shown that the 150 mutation of 340 - KRRK - 343 to alanine residues does not affect the kinetochore 151 localization of the mutant [ 27 ] . Therefore , this region of 313 - 507 is not essential for the 152 kinetochore localization of Spc105 . Truncation of 313 - 638 or 313 - 709 completely 153 abrogated kinetochore localization of Spc105 . According to our analysis , spc105 599 - 625 154 may harbor an NLS , and deletion of this signal may have abrogated kinetochore 155 localization of the mutants expressing spc105 Δ 313 - 638 or spc105 Δ 313 - 709 . We introduced 156 SV40 - NLS ( NLS SV40 ) at the N - terminus of spc105 Δ 313 - 638 : : GFP to check if nuclear 157 localization of this mutant rescues its loading at the kinetochores ( Figure 2B , bottom 158 left ) . However , we did not observe any kinetochore - specific localization . 159 Subsequently , we wanted to check whether these truncation mutants can support cell 160 viability . To address this , we induced sporulation / meiosis in heterozygous diploid strains 161 expressing these truncated molecules of spc105 ( Δ 313 - 455 or Δ 313 - 507 ) . We observed 162 that they were able to complement the deletion of endogenous SPC105 ( spc105 ∆ ) . We 163 can conclude that the domain of 313 - 507 is not essential for any activity of Spc105 that 164 contributes to cell viability . On the contrary , Spc105 mutants with either 313 - 638 or 313 - 165 709 truncated could not rescue the viability of spc105 ∆ . Even fusion of SV40 - NLS 166 ( NLS SV40 ) at the N - terminus of spc105 Δ 313 - 638 did not rescue its ability to support the cell 167 viability in the absence of wild - type Spc105 ( Figure 2B right and bottom left ) . This data 168 set reveals that the proper localization of Spc105 at the kinetochore is essential for its 169 proper function . They also infer that the lack of nuclear localization cannot explain the 170 lethality of the ( spc105 Δ 313 - 638 ) mutant . 171 We confirmed these observations using the plasmid - shuffle assay ( data not shown ) . 172 Therefore , we hypothesized that the domain of Spc105 housed within amino acid 507 - 173 638 directly interacts with Kre28 . Deletion of this domain abrogates the interaction 174 resulting in delocalization of Spc105 from the kinetochores . 175 To biochemically confirm the results of the 2 - hybrid and localization experiments , we 176 immunoprecipitated GFP - labeled versions of Spc105 from strains expressing either 177 Spc105 455 : : GFP ( FL ) or spc105 Δ 313 - 638 : : GFP ( Δ 313 - 638 ) and examined if both molecules 178 interact with Kre28 ( Figure 2C ) . Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis 179 demonstrated that even though Spc105 455 : : GFP binds Kre28 - 5xFlag , the mutant of 180 spc105 Δ 313 - 638 : : GFP is unable to do so , which indicates that a domain harbored within 181 Spc105 507 - 638 is essential for its interaction with Kre28 and subsequently its recruitment 182 at the kinetochores . 183 184 Truncation of Kre28 disrupts its localization from kinetochore . However , 185 truncation mutants of Kre28 support cell viability when over - expressed . 186 Our yeast two - hybrid assay ( Figure 2A ) indicated that the Spc105 interacting domain of 187 Kre28 lies within amino acid 127 - 201 of Kre28 . The predicted secondary structure of 188 Kre28 FL showed that the aforesaid region of Kre28 is helix rich and structured ( Figure 189 3A , http : / / bioinf . cs . ucl . ac . uk / psipred , also see Figure S3A ) . To check which domain of 190 Kre28 is essential for its loading at the kinetochore and interaction with Spc105 , we 191 created yeast strains that express GFP - fused Kre28 fragments from the ADH1 192 promoter . We examined their localization in a diploid yeast strain where one genomic 193 copy of KRE28 is deleted , and the other allele is tagged with mCherry at its C - terminus 194 ( Figure 3B ) . As expected , GFP - Kre28 FL localizes at the kinetochore . On the contrary , 195 we could not detect the localization of GFP - kre28 ∆ 127 - 182 or fragments with larger 196 truncations at the kinetochores . When over - expressed from pr ADH1 , GFP - fused 197 versions of Kre28 FL and its truncations revealed a high cytoplasmic GFP signal ( Figure 198 3B ) . Therefore , we performed similar experiments with the SV40 - NLS at the C - terminus 199 of GFP - kre28 ∆ 127 - 182 . Even in this case , we did not see any kinetochore localization 200 ( data not shown ) . It should be noted that the GFP tagged Kre28 FL and its truncations 201 were expressed at similar levels ( Figure 3C ) . 202 Does Kre28 delocalization affect the cell viability when yeast cells express the mutants 203 in the absence of wild - type Kre28 ? To test this , we sporulated these diploid strains and 204 isolated haploid spores . We observed that the segregants over - expressing truncated 205 versions of kre28 rescued the deletion of endogenous KRE28 ( kre28 ∆ ) . However , the 206 segregants expressing truncated kre28 molecules from their native promoter ( KRE28pr ) 207 could not complement genomic KRE28 deletion ( Figure 3D ) . These data indicate that 208 full - length Kre28 is essential for binding with Spc105 and its interaction with the Mtw1 209 complex . However , truncated kre28 mutants with defective kinetochore localization 210 were able to sustain cell viability when overexpressed . We backcrossed viable spores 211 with the parent strain ( YEF473 ) to avoid background mutations . The segregants isolated 212 from those crosses were subjected to further experiments . 213 214 Truncation mutants of Kre28 do not affect kinetochore biorientation but 215 significantly reduce the recruitment of Spc105 . 216 We observed slower colony growth among the segregants expressing only the kre28 217 truncation mutants ( Figure 3D and 5B ) . The slow growth suggested that these mutants 218 have a high propensity of chromosome missegregation , and this will affect their viability . 219 Among these mutants , we chose kre28 Δ 127 - 182 for further analysis because this is the 220 smallest truncation that has a significant defect in kinetochore localization . To check 221 whether kre28 Δ 127 - 182 affects the biorientation of sister kinetochores , we tagged Ndc80 222 and Spc105 individually with mCherry and studied kinetochore biorientation in kre28 223 truncation mutant ( Figure 4A and 4B ) . We did not find any noticeable defects in the 224 bipolar attachment of metaphase kinetochores in this mutant ( Figure S2F ) . However , we 225 observed a significant decrease ( approximately 61 % ) in Spc105 recruitment in the 226 truncation mutants ( Figure 4B ) with a much smaller change ( ~ 24 % ) in Ndc80 227 localization ( Figure 4A ) . 228 To further characterize the correlation between Kre28 and Spc105 recruitment to the 229 kinetochore , we varied the amount of either Kre28 or Spc105 per the kinetochores by 230 exploiting variable expression of the respective protein using the galactose - induced 231 GALL promoter and quantified the amount of Spc105 and Kre28 respectively per 232 bioriented kinetochore ( Figure 4Ci and ii ) . This quantification revealed that the amount 233 of kinetochore localized Kre28 and Spc105 is mutually correlated . As the number of 234 molecules of either protein increases , so does the number of molecules of the other . As 235 expected , both numbers saturate at ~ 8 molecules per kinetochore , which is close to the 236 maximal number of Ndc80 complex molecules per yeast kinetochore [ 28 ] . Given that 237 Spc105 can localize to kinetochores even in strains over - expressing Kre28 fragments , 238 these results strongly suggest that Kre28 positively contributes to Spc105 interactions 239 with the Mtw1 complex . We also found that the number of Ndc80 molecules per 240 kinetochore was slightly lower in cells with kinetochores containing small numbers of 241 Kre28 molecules per kinetochore ( Figure 4Ciii ) . This result is consistent with our prior 242 work , which showed that a reduction in Spc105 molecules per kinetochore similarly 243 lowers the number of Ndc80 molecules per kinetochore [ 28 ] . 244 Finally , we performed the immunoblot assay following RFP - trap experiments to assess 245 the severity of impairment in the interaction between kre28 Δ 127 - 182 and Spc105 . We 246 observed that the co - precipitation of kre28 Δ 127 - 182 with Spc105 - mCherry was significantly 247 reduced ( approximately 40 % , Figure 4D , please see the figure legend and Materials 248 and Methods section for details of band intensity calculation and normalization ) . 249 Moreover , we detected the protein level of Spc105 was reduced in the presence of 250 kre28 Δ 127 - 182 ( approximately 69 % , Figure 4D , panel of anti - DsRed blot ) . This set of 251 observations imply that the coiled domain Kre28 containing amino acid residue 127 - 182 252 plays a significant role in the binding of Kre28 and Spc105 . They also suggest that 253 Kre28 plays a role the maintaining the stability of Spc105 protein . 254 255 Truncation of Kre28 adversely affects the spindle assembly checkpoint and error 256 correction pathway and impairs the generation of diploid yeast strains and 257 subsequent meiosis . 258 Spc105 contains short linear interaction motifs known as MELT motifs that , when 259 phosphorylated by the Mps1 kinase , serve as the scaffold for checkpoint components 260 [ 16 , 17 ] . Moreover , the evolutionarily conserved RVSF motif present in the N - terminus 261 of Spc105 acts as the primary binding motif of protein phosphatase I ( PP1 ) that 262 dephosphorylates the MELT repeats to silence the SAC [ 19 ] . Therefore , Spc105 263 delocalization may affect SAC activation and silencing . 264 We first studied SAC signaling in cells over - expressing kre28 Δ 127 - 182 by treating cell 265 cultures with the microtubule poison nocodazole and performing flow cytometry to 266 quantify cellular DNA content . The flow cytometry revealed that SAC strength was not 267 discernably different in strains expressing Kre28 FL and kre28 Δ 127 - 182 , as indicated by the 268 arrest of the cell population with 2N DNA content ( Figure 5A ) . However , we have 269 previously shown that this assay cannot detect smaller defects in SAC signaling [ 24 ] . To 270 examine the efficacy to detect smaller defects in SAC and that of the error correction 271 process in kre28 mutants , we subjected them to a low dose of another microtubule 272 poison , benomyl . At its dosage used in this assay , benomyl destabilizes microtubules , 273 and forces yeast cells to rely on a combination of effective error correction and SAC 274 signaling to ensure chromosome biorientation and accurate chromosome segregation 275 [ 24 ] . The strains that express kre28 with larger truncations ( ∆ 127 - 201 , ∆ 1 - 201 , and ∆ 1 - 276 126 ) demonstrated growth defects even in non - selective growth media ( YPD ) . We also 277 performed the benomyl sensitivity assay using a strain where SV40 - NLS is fused to 278 Kre28 127 - 182 at the C - terminus . Fusion of NLS also did not alleviate the effect of kre28 279 truncation , suggesting that the afore - mentioned phenotypes are not caused by 280 delocalization of kre28 from the nucleus ( Figure 5B bottom ) . The growth defects of the 281 kre28 truncation mutants in benomyl - containing media strongly imply that their ability to 282 activate a robust SAC and / or error correction pathway is compromised . Reduced 283 Spc105 loading in the kinetochore of these mutants can explain the observed 284 deficiencies in SAC signaling , error correction , or both . 285 Previous studies showed that the spindle assembly checkpoint is essential to ensure 286 the fidelity of meiotic segregation [ 29 , 30 ] . Therefore , delocalization of kre28 may also 287 result in defects in meiotic processes . To examine this aspect , we produced zygotes by 288 crossing a and α haploid strains that over - express truncated kre28 in the absence of 289 any wild - type Kre28 . However , these zygotes had severe growth defects ( Figure 5C ) . 290 We did not find any nuclear fusion defects during mating of these haploid cells ( data not 291 shown ) . Furthermore , when we sporulated these slow - growing homozygous diploid 292 strains ( as shown in one of the panels of homozygosis in Figure 5C ) and dissected 293 tetrads , we observed a significant decrease in the number of viable segregants ( Figure 294 5D , right panel ) . In control experiments , we did not observe any defects in heterozygous 295 diploid formation ( Figure 5C , left panel ) or the growth of viable segregants after 296 subsequent sporulation ( Figure 5D , left panel ) . We have tabulated our observations for 297 the truncation mutants of Kre28 , which we studied here ( Table 1 ) . The observation of 298 truncated kre28 mutants affecting meiosis in yeast is similar to what was previously 299 observed in mice oocyte meiosis [ 31 ] . 300 301 Discussion 302 Here we have elucidated how Spc105 and Kre28 are localized and aligned in the 303 microtubule attachment sites of the bioriented kinetochores of budding yeast cells . 304 Kre28 - C localizes approximately 48 nm away from the N - terminus of Ndc80 . This is 305 consistent with observations reported previously with Zwint1 , the human orthologue of 306 Kre28 [ 21 ] . Our FRET data are also in accordance with previously published 307 biochemical and cell biological studies [ 13 , 14 , 21 ] . Interestingly , we could not 308 determine the FRET between Kre28 - C and components of the Mtw1 complex because 309 strains expressing the fluorescent fusions were inviable . The fluorescent tags most 310 likely disrupt interactions between Spc105 / Kre28 and the Mtw1 complex , which results 311 in synthetic lethality [ 13 ] . Most strikingly , we observed that the stoichiometry of Kre28 to 312 Spc105 is 1 : 1 , whereas it was previously thought to be 2 : 1 [ 11 ] . 313 Results of the yeast two - hybrid assays involving Kre28 FL and Spc105 455 - 709 were 314 consistent with previously published data from Yanagida lab [ 14 , 25 ] . However , it was 315 unclear yeast two - hybrid assay did not work between Kre28 FL and spc105 455 - 917 316 ( spc105 CC + RWD ) . It may be the case that CC + RWD ( Spc105 455 - 917 ) fusion with GAL4 317 binding domain ( GBD _ C1 ) did not fold in a way that they can interact with Kre28 . On the 318 other hand , it is also possible that RWD interfering with the binding of CC and Kre28 319 has an unknown physiological significance . Although we obtained yeast two - hybrid 320 interaction between kre28 1 - 201 and spc105 455 - 709 , we did not detect any kinetochore 321 localization of kre28 1 - 201 . It was also not sufficient to support cell viability in the absence 322 of wild - type Kre28 . Much to our surprise , even after taking the data of Herzog lab into 323 consideration , when we maintained the two binding sites of Spc105 ( kre28 128 – 169 and 324 kre28 229 – 259 ) in our kre28 cassette ( kre28 Δ 1 - 126 ) [ 13 ] , we did not see any kinetochore 325 localization . After considering these data , we can conclude that full - length Kre28 is 326 essential for its localization and for full kinetochore recruitment of Spc105 . 327 Despite being an essential and conserved component of the kinetochore , the structure 328 of Kre28 remains unknown , and the absence of a structure prevents a clear 329 understanding of the implications of our data . Therefore , to provide a structural context 330 to our interaction - mapping and kinetochore localization experiments , we used an 331 implementation of Alphafold2 to predict structures of protein complexes using Google 332 Collaboratory known as Colabfold 333 ( https : / / colab . research . google . com / github / sokrypton / ColabFold / blob / main / beta / AlphaFol 334 d2 _ advanced . ipynb , [ 32 ] ) . Using Colabfold , we predicted the structure of a heterodimer 335 of Kre28 FL and the C - terminal region of Spc105 451 - 917 ( Figure S3B ) . The N - terminal 336 boundary of Spc105 used in the structure prediction was chosen based on the start of 337 the structured region within Spc105 . Alphafold predicts a ‘T’ shaped architecture for the 338 Kre28 - Spc105 451 - 917 heterodimer with high confidence for most residues predicted to 339 possess secondary structure ( scores 97 % - 23 % , Figure S3B - C ) . The Pairwise Alignment 340 Error matrix suggests with high confidence that extensive interactions occur among 341 residues in the N - and C - terminal halves of the two proteins . These interactions give 342 rise to two distinct domains within the heterodimer , but the relative organization of these 343 domains cannot be inferred ( Figure S3D ) . The structure correlates very well with the 344 coiled - coil domain predictions for Kre28 and Spc105 ( Figures S3A , S3E ) . It is also 345 consistent with our limited FRET data . We detected significant and similar FRET 346 between Kre28 - mCherry and either Spc105 709 : : GFP or Spc105 - GFP ( Figure 1 ) . In the 347 predicted structure , the separation between Kre28 - C and Spc105 709 and Spc105 - C is 348 similar ( 4 . 6 nm and 4 . 8 nm respectively , Figure S3F ) . Interestingly , we did not detect 349 any FRET between Kre28 - mCherry and a Spc105 455 : : GFP , even though the model 350 predicts a separation of 7 . 1 nm between these two points ( Figure S3F ) . However , the 351 model also predicts that the donor and acceptor fluorophores will be in two different 352 domains , and the relative configuration of the two domains is unknown ( Figure S3D ) . 353 Therefore , the actual separation between Kre28 - C and Spc105 455 is likely to be > 10 354 nm . The predicted model is also in agreement regarding the residues in Kre28 identified 355 by a previous study to be critical in mediating its interaction with Spc105 [ 13 ] . In 356 conclusion , the extensive interaction interface between the two proteins with 357 involvement from residues over nearly the entire length of Kre28 predicted by the model 358 can explain why we could not eliminate the interaction between Spc105 and Kre28 359 using extensive truncations in either protein . 360 Our data of Spc105 protein becoming destabilized in the kre28 Δ 127 - 182 mutant ( Figure 361 4D , panel of anti - DsRed blot ) implies that impairment of Kre28 - Spc105 interaction 362 significantly affects Spc105 integrity of expression . This implication is in accordance 363 with a previously reported study by Zhang and colleagues , where they depleted Zwint1 364 by RNAi and demonstrated that the cellular protein level of hSpc105 is depleted [ 33 ] . A 365 study in the fission yeast S . pombe also revealed that kinetochore proteins like Spc105 366 are surveilled by protein quality control machinery that includes Hsp70 , Bag102 , the 367 26S proteasome , Ubc4 , and the ubiquitin - ligases Ubr11 and San1 [ 34 ] . In that study , 368 the authors suggested that cells employ this mechanism to maintain the homeostasis of 369 nuclear components and genomic integrity . We came across another indirect evidence 370 of protein quality regulation of Spc105 and Kre28 from Yong - Gonzales and colleagues . 371 They showed that both of these proteins become sumoylated by Smc5 - Smc6 complex 372 and deleterious mutations in Smc5 - Smc6 complex leads to chromosome loss [ 35 ] . 373 Consistent with the above - mentioned studies , the Biggins lab also discovered 374 Mub1 / Ubr2 ubiquitin ligase complex to be a part of a quality control mechanism that 375 monitors kinetochore protein Dsn1 [ 36 ] . A similar mechanism likely controls Spc105 376 and / or Kre28 levels in S . cerevisiae . 377 Does Kre28 act as a chaperon to stabilize the recruitment of Spc105 at the 378 kinetochore ? Some of the previous studies argue against this hypothesis . In human 379 kinetochore , Zwint1 is dispensable for the interaction between hSpc105 and Mis12 380 complex [ 14 , 15 ] . While performing ex - vivo kinetochore assembly experiments , Biggins 381 lab showed that Ipl1 phosphorylation of Dsn1 , which triggers outer - kinetochore 382 assembly , also recruits Kre28 , which should be specific to mitotic cells [ 37 ] . 383 Contrastingly , we observed a similar level of Kre28 at the kinetochores at every stage in 384 the cell cycle , including the G1 - S phase ( unbudded and small budded cells , data not 385 shown ) , which implies that Kre28 loading at the kinetochore takes place at the same 386 time point as loading of Spc105 . Combining our observations with those from Herzog 387 lab , we can conclude that kre28 127 - 182 contributes to the main interaction between Kre28 388 and Spc105 and kre28 229 - 259 contributes to interaction with the Mtw1 complex . However , 389 full - length Kre28 is essential for proper binding with Spc105 , their mutual recruitment , 390 and their activity at the kinetochores . Kre28 may also become phosphorylated by Ipl1 , 391 which can trigger its association with Spc105 and subsequently their loading at the 392 kinetochores . 393 Does Kre28 have a specific function in spindle assembly checkpoint and error 394 correction or during meiosis ? The results of the functional assays ( Figure 5 ) clearly 395 show that the delocalization of Kre28 from the kinetochore impairs the processes . 396 However , all these phenotypes may be linked with the delocalization of Spc105 . We 397 also came across the same issue with Zwint1 [ 21 , 33 , 38 ] . Our experiment where we 398 observed a significant number of inviable segregants after sporulation of homozygous 399 diploid strains expressing only truncated kre28 ( kre28 Δ 127 - 182 ) are also in agreement with 400 a study done by Dong Woo Seo and colleagues [ 31 ] . According to that study , Zwint1 401 depletion results in erroneous chromosome alignment and a high frequency of 402 aneuploidy during mice oocyte meiosis . Our study suggests that this function of Zwint1 403 is also conserved in yeast Kre28 . 404 405 Materials and methods 406 Plasmid and Strain construction 407 The strains and plasmids utilized in this study are documented in table 2 and 3 , 408 respectively . Yeast strains containing multiple genetic modifications were constructed 409 by standard yeast genetic techniques . GFP ( S65T ) and mCherry fusion of proteins were 410 used to localize kinetochores by fluorescence microscopy . The C - terminal tags like 411 GFP , mCherry , 5xFlag and gene deletion cassettes like spc105 Δ : : NAT and 412 kre28 Δ : : NAT were introduced at the endogenous locus through homologous 413 recombination of PCR amplicons [ 39 ] . A 7 - amino - acid linker ( sequence : ' RIPGLIN ' ) 414 bridges the tags ( GFP , mCherry , or 5xFlag ) from the C - termini of the tagged proteins . 415 Earlier , we observed that the intensity of mCherry - tagged kinetochore proteins varies 416 significantly from one transformant to another for the same strain , due to inherent 417 variability of the mCherry brightness . Therefore , to construct all the FRET strains with 418 Ndc80 , Stu2 , Nsl1 , Kre28 and Ask1 - mCherry , we crossed a specific mCherry strain with 419 haploid strains of all GFP fused Spc105 alleles and sporulated the heterozygous 420 diploids to obtain the desired segregants . 421 To construct the yeast strains with internally tagged Spc105 mentioned in Figure S1 , 422 and the strains with truncated Spc105 mentioned in Figure 3 , first we used Bst EII digest 423 of pRS305 chimera or Stu I digest of pRS306 chimera of Spc105 - GFP fusion alleles to 424 transform AJY3278 ( SPC105 / ∆ : : NAT ) that was later sporulated to obtain the haploid 425 segregants expressing only GFP fusion copy of Spc105 . To construct some these 426 strains first we deleted the genomic copy of SPC105 in a strain already supplemented 427 with the wild - type SPC105 gene expressed from centromeric plasmid yCP50 ( URA3 ) . 428 Then the pRS315 chimera containing Spc105 - GFP alleles were transformed in that 429 strain . After that , the strains expressing only Spc105 - GFP alleles were generated by 430 negative selection for yCP50 on 5 - FOA plates . 431 The construction of chimeras for overexpression of Kre28 FL or truncations was achieved 432 by cloning N - terminal GFP tagged fusions of Kre28 in a centromeric plasmid pRS414 , 433 where KRE28 ORF is flanked by ADH1 ( Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1 ) promoter and GFP 434 ORF at the upstream and CYC ( Cytochrome C ) terminator at the downstream ( obtained 435 from Dr . Mara Duncan’s lab , department of Cell and Developmental Biology , University 436 of Michigan ) . Kre28 fragments were cloned in Bam HI - Pst I sites . SV40 - Nuclear 437 localization signal ( NLS ) was cloned within Pst I - Sal I . For wild - type expression , Kre28 FL 438 and its truncations were cloned in Bam HI - Pst I of a pRS305 plasmid . They were 439 expressed as N - terminal GFP tagged fusions by its own promoter and terminator . Bst EII 440 digests of these chimeras are transformed in AJY3298 ( kre28 Δ : : NAT / KRE28 - mCherry - 441 Hyg ) to check for their localization . To create diploid zygotes , two strains of a and α 442 mating types are mixed with each other and spotted on YPD plate which was incubated 443 for 3 - 4 hours at 30°C . To induce sporulation , diploid yeast cells were grown in YPD 444 overnight to stationary phase . Next day cells were pelleted down and resuspended with 445 starvation media ( 0 . 1 % yeast extract , 1 % potassium acetate , 0 . 025 % dextrose ) and 446 incubated 4 - 5 days at RT . 447 Yeast two hybrid assay 448 We performed yeast two hybrid experiments by co - transforming both of prey 449 ( pGAD _ C1 ) and bait ( pGBD _ C1 ) chimera in strain AJY3802 ( PJ69A ) [ 40 ] . Then we 450 streaked two of the transformants for each prey - bait pair on synthetic dextrose plates of 451 histidine dropout ( - HIS ) and dropout of histidine and adenine ( - HIS - ADE ) . Plates were 452 incubated in 32°C for at least 3 days . 453 Benomyl sensitivity assay 454 This experiment was performed as described previously [ 24 , 27 ] . Starting from 0 . 1 455 OD 600 of log phase cultures , we prepared 10 - fold serial dilutions and frogged or spotted 456 them on YPD and YPD containing 20 μ g / ml and 30 μ g / ml benomyl . At least two 457 biological replicates were used , and spotting were repeated twice for each set of 458 experiments . The plates were incubated at 32 °C and pictures were taken after 2 ( YPD ) 459 to 3 ( YPD + Benomyl ) days . For space limitations , we showed only YPD + Ben 30 plates . 460 For all spotting assays with benomyl , we used YEF473 or strain expressing 461 Spc105 222 : : GFP as wide - type ( positive control ) and mad2 ∆ or sgo1 Δ as negative controls . 462 Before spotting , we grew the strains expressing truncated kre28 or Kre28 FL control in 463 synthetic dextrose media ( Sd - Trp ) without Tryptophan to culture only cells carrying the 464 pRS414 chimera . As shown in the plate images , we also used strains expressing 465 Kre28 FL - mCherry along with truncated kre28 as controls which did not show any 466 discernable difference in growth , compared to wild - type . 467 Microscopy and image acquisition and analyses 468 A Nikon Ti - E inverted microscope with a 1 . 4 NA , 100X , oil - immersion objective was 469 used for experiments mentioned in the paper [ 41 ] . A ten - plane Z - stack was acquired 470 ( 200nm separation between adjacent planes ) . To measure Ndc80 and Spc105 - 471 mCherry , an extra 1 . 5x opto - var lens was used . We measured total fluorescence of 472 kinetochore clusters ( 16 kinetochores in metaphase ) by integrating the intensities over a 473 6x6 region centered on the maximum intensity pixel . We used median intensity of pixels 474 immediately surrounding the 6x6 area to correct for background fluorescence . The 475 calculation was performed using semi - automated MATLAB programs as described 476 earlier [ 42 ] . FRET , high - resolution colocalization , fluorescence distribution analyses and 477 analyses of the images were performed as previously described [ 6 , 28 , 41 , 43 , 44 ] . 478 While measuring proximity ratio , we considered any value below 0 . 10 as no FRET 479 ( mean of the data marked as black ) , range between 0 . 10 and 0 . 3 as medium to low 480 FRET ( average of the data marked as red ) and any values above 0 . 3 as high FRET 481 ( mean of the data marked as red ) . 482 Titration of Kre28 and Spc105 proteins levels and quantification of Kre28 , Spc105 483 and Ndc80 intensities 484 We grew the strains with prGALL - SPC105 or prGALL - KRE28 in presence of raffinose 485 ( 2 % ) . On the day of the assay , we supplemented the media with variable amounts of 486 galactose as discussed previously ( 2 % , 1 . 5 % , 0 . 5 % , 0 . 2 % , 0 . 1 % and 0 . 05 % ) [ 28 ] . We 487 determined the number of Kre28 , Spc105 and Ndc80 from their intensities as reported 488 previously [ 28 ] . We first deduced the fluorescence intensities of Kre28 - mCherry , Ndc80 - 489 GFP and Spc105 - GFP from bioriented kinetochores . We used AJY939 ( Ndc80 - GFP , 490 Spc25 - mCherry ) as a reference to obtain the intensities for known number of Ndc80 491 and Spc25 molecules at the bioriented kinetochores . AJY939 was cultured under same 492 imaging conditions as the experimental strains , and the calibration data was acquired 493 throughout the duration of this study . This calibration accounted for alteration in the 494 microscope and imaging technique set up over time . We used the values of Ndc80 - GFP 495 and Spc25 - mcherry to determine the number of molecules of Spc105 - GFP and Kre28 - 496 mCherry that were loaded in the bioriented kinetochores . 497 Preparation of cell lysates and western blot assay 498 To prepare cell lysates , log - phase cells ( OD 600 2 . 0 ) were pelleted , resuspended in 499 sample buffer ( 2 % SDS , 1 % 2 - mercaptoethanol ) , boiled , and lysed by glass - bead 500 mechanical disruption [ 6 ] . The lysates were collected after centrifugation . After 501 separating the proteins by 10 % SDS – PAGE , samples were transferred to nitrocellulose 502 or PVDF blocked with 5 % skimmed milk in TBS - T ( 137 mM NaCl , 15 . 2 mM Tris - HCl , 503 4 . 54 mM Tris , 0 . 896 mM Tween 20 ) , and then probed with primary and fluorescent 504 secondary antibodies . Mouse α - GFP antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology 505 ( 1 : 2000 , GFP ( B - 2 ) : sc - 9996 ) . Peroxidase conjugated α - mouse IgG ( 1 : 5000 ; Sigma , A - 506 4416 ) treated with ECL ( Thermo scientific ) was used to develop the western blot . 507 GFP - trap and RFP - trap assay to pull down Spc105 and immunoblot assay 508 We used AJY6273 and AJY6274 for GFP - trap experiments . As mentioned in the strain 509 list , AJY6273 expresses Spc105 455 : : GFP from a centromeric plasmid ( pRS315 ) and 510 genomic SPC105 allele is deleted . The truncation of 313 - 638 affects the cell viability , 511 hence in AJY6374 , the genomic SPC105 allele was intact and spc105 Δ 313 - 638 was 512 expressed from a centromeric plasmid ( pRS315 ) . We grew both the strains in synthetic 513 dextrose media devoid of Leucine ( SD - LEU ) to maintain the centromeric plasmid before 514 harvesting them for cell lysis . For RFP - trap assays we used AJY3483 and AJY3484 515 ( See strain list for detailed information on their genotypes ) . We grew the strains in SD - 516 TRP ( Synthetic dextrose devoid of Tryptophan ) media till late log - phase before 517 harvesting the cells . We lysed the cells by glass - beads in presence of buffer H 0 . 15 ( 25 518 mM HEPES of pH 8 . 0 , 2 . 0 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA of pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA - KOH of 519 pH 8 . 0 , 15 % Glycerol , 0 . 1 % IGEPAL - CA - 630 , 150 mM KCl ) , supplemented with 0 . 2 mM 520 PMSF , protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails [ 45 ] . We isolated 521 clear lysates of the strains and from there , we incubated equal amount of lysates with 522 pre - equilibrated beads of GFP - trap ( Chromotex , gta - 20 ) or RFP - Trap ( Chromotek , rta - 523 20 ) overnight . Next day , we washed the beads with post IP wash buffer ( composition as 524 mentioned above ) with and without 2mM Dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , before boiling them in 525 presence of 1xSDS loading buffer . 526 After subjecting the proteins through SDS - PAGE , we transferred them to nitrocellulose 527 membrane which we blocked with 5 % skimmed milk in 1x phosphate buffered saline - 528 Tween ( PBS - T , 137 mM NaCl , 10 mM phosphate , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) . We 529 probed the blot with Mouse anti - GFP ( JL8 , Living Colors , Takara , 1 : 3000 ) or Mouse anti 530 Ds - Red ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 390909 , 1 : 2000 ) , Mouse α - Flag M2 ( Sigma - 531 Aldrich , 1 : 5 , 000 ) and HRP conjugated secondary anti - Mouse ( Sigma aldrich , 1 : 10000 ) . 532 ECL ( Thermo scientific ) treatment was used to develop the western blot . We exposed 533 the anti - Ds - Red blots to X - ray films . Anti - GFP and anti - Flag blots were imaged by C600 534 imager ( Azure Biosystems ) . 535 We calculated the band intensities by ImageJ in RFP - TRAP assay . Then we normalized 536 both Spc105 and Kre28 intensities of the truncation mutants with those of the full - length 537 proteins . After that , we normalized Kre28 IP intensities with that of normalized Kre28 538 input values . Following that , we divided the Kre28 IP intensities with Spc105 IP 539 intensities . We mentioned those values as fold difference at the bottom of the 540 immunoblot panels ( Figure 4D ) . 541 Flow cytometry 542 We performed flow cytometry as described previously [ 24 , 27 ] . For strains expressing 543 Kre28 _ FL or truncated kre28 , we started with overnight inoculums grown in Sd - Trp and 544 shifted to YPD to grow till early to mid - log phase before supplementing the media with 545 Nocodazole ( final concentration 15µg / ml ) or DMSO control . We collected cell samples 546 at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 - hour post drug treatment and fixed them with 70 % ethanol before storing 547 them at 4 (cid:4) C overnight . Next day , after removing the Ethanol , treated the samples with 548 bovine pancreatic RNase ( Millipore Sigma , final concentration 170 ng / ml ) at 37°C for 6 549 h - overnight in RNase buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH8 . 0 , 15 mM NaCl ) . After that , we removed 550 the RNase and resuspended the cells in 1x PBS . We treated the samples with 551 propidium iodide ( Millipore Sigma , final concentration 5 mg / ml in PBS ) for at least 1 h at 552 room temperature before analyzing them using the LSR Fortessa machine ( BD 553 Biosciences ) in Biomedical research core facility , University of Michigan medical school . 554 We analyzed and organized the data using FlowJo software ( FlowJo _ V10 . 7 . 1 _ CL ) . 555 Nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) mapping 556 We performed NLS mapping by pasting the amino acid sequences of Spc105 and 557 Kre28 in the website of http : / / nls - mapper . iab . keio . ac . jp / cgi - bin / NLS _ Mapper _ form . cgi 558 and keeping the cut off score to 5 . 0 [ 46 , 47 ] . It scored SV40 - NLS ( TPPKKKRKVA , 559 monopartite ) as 15 . 5 . We observed score of 9 . 0 ( monopartite ) for Spc105 337 - 345 560 ( SSNKRRKLD ) and 6 . 9 ( bipartite ) for Spc105 599 - 625 561 ( NTLKREYEKLNEEVEKVNSIRGKIRKL ) . We did not find any NLS for Kre28 without 562 setting the cut - off score to 4 . 0 . Kre28 207 - 234 and Kre28 286 - 317 displayed NLS scores of 4 . 2 563 and 4 . 0 ( bipartite ) respectively . 564 Prediction of coiled coil domains in Kre28 and spc105 451 - 917 565 We predicted the Coiled coil domains of full - length Kre28 and spc105 451 - 917 by inserting 566 their amino acid sequences on the website of https : / / embnet . vital - 567 it . ch / software / COILS _ form . html [ 48 ] . We used MTIDK matrix for the prediction . We 568 downloaded the output in postscript format and further configured by adobe illustrator . 569 Prediction of spc105 451 - 917 - Kre28 interaction interface by Colabfold 570 We used Colabfold to predict the complex formed by interaction of Kre28 FL and 571 spc105 451 - 917 572 ( https : / / colab . research . google . com / github / sokrypton / ColabFold / blob / main / beta / AlphaFol 573 d2 _ advanced . ipynb , [ 32 ] ) . The following parameters were used for the structure 574 prediction : msa _ method : mmseqs _ 2 , pair _ mode : unpaired , pair _ cov = 50 , pair _ qid = 575 20 , rank _ by = pTMscore , num _ models = 5 , use _ ptm = True , max _ recycles = 3 , tol = 0 , 576 num _ samples = 1 , subsample _ msa = True , num _ relax = None . We processed the 577 figures of the predicted structure by PyMOL 2 . 5 ( https : / / pymol . org / 2 / , Schrödinger , 578 LLC ) . The pLDDT confidence matrix was depicted by spectrum b mapping in PyMOL . 579 Pair Alignment Error matrix was prepared by Colabfold . 580 Statistical analysis 581 We analyzed the data and assembled the graphs by GraphPad Prism 8 software . We 582 performed unpaired t - test ( Mann Whitney test ) and one - way anova analyses to check 583 the statistical significances of the data .
