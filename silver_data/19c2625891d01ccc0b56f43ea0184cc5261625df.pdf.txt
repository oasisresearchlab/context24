Pollard , Yale University , New Haven , CT , and approved February 13 , 2018 ( received for review November 9 , 2017 ) Actin , one of the most abundant proteins in nature , participates in countless cellular functions ranging from organelle trafficking and pathogen motility to cell migration and regulation of gene transcrip - tion . Actin ’ s cellular activities depend on the dynamic transition be - tween its monomeric and filamentous forms , a process exquisitely regulated in cells by a large number of actin - binding and signaling proteins . Additionally , several posttranslational modifications control the cellular functions of actin , including most notably N - terminal ( Nt ) - acetylation , a prevalent modification throughout the animal kingdom . However , the biological role and mechanism of actin Nt - acetylation are poorly understood , and the identity of actin ’ s N - terminal acetyltransfer - ase ( NAT ) has remained a mystery . Here , we reveal that NAA80 , a sug - gested NAT enzyme whose substrate specificity had not been characterized , is Nt - acetylating actin . We further show that actin Nt - acetylation plays crucial roles in cytoskeletal assembly in vitro and in cells . The absence of Nt - acetylation leads to significant differences in the rates of actin filament depolymerization and elongation , including elongationdrivenbyformins , whereas filament nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex is mostly unaffected . NAA80 - knockout cells display severely altered cytoskeletal organization , including an increase in the ratio of filamentous to globular actin , increased filopodia and lamellipodia for - mation , and accelerated cell motility . Together , the results demonstrate NAA80 ’ s role as actin ’ s NAT and reveal a crucial role for actin Nt - acetylation in the control of cytoskeleton structure and dynamics . actin | NAA80 | NAT | N - terminal acetylation | cell motility H umans express six highly conserved actin isoforms , which account for ∼ 5 % of the total protein in most cells and ∼ 20 % in muscle cells ( 1 ) . Actin ’ s abundance is paralleled by its crucial role in countless cellular functions ( 2 ) , which are regulated in cells by a large number of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) ( 3 ) . An es - sential group of actin regulators is those that control the initiation of actin polymerization , known as “ actin nucleators ” ( 4 ) . By over - coming the rate - limiting step in actin polymerization , i . e . , nucle - ation , these proteins control the spatiotemporal polymerization of actin as well as the specific morphology of actin networks ( 2 , 5 ) . Two types of nucleators , actin - related proteins ( the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ) and formins , mediate most nucleation activities in cells . The Arp2 / 3 complex is responsible for the formation of branched actin networks ( 6 ) , whereas formins mediate the assembly of unbranched filament structures such as filopodia and stress fibers ( 7 ) . Other than ABPs , several forms of posttranslational modifications ( PTMs ) regulate actin ’ s function , among which N - terminal ( Nt ) - acetylation is the most widespread . Protein Nt - acetylation , affecting 80 – 90 % of all proteins in humans , is emerging as a key regulator of cell function ( 8 – 10 ) with major roles in the control of protein lifetime ( 11 , 12 ) , protein – protein interaction ( 13 ) , and protein folding ( 14 ) . While most eukaryotic proteins are Nt - acetylated cotranslationally by one of several ribosome - associated N - terminal acetyltransferases ( NATs ) , i . e . , NatA – NatE ( 8 ) , animal actins are processed posttranslationally ( 15 ) . The omnipresence of Nt - acetylation in actin suggests that it can be conceptually viewed as part of its functional sequence and is thus thought to play a major role in cytoskeleton assembly by making actin ’ s exposed N terminus exceptionally acidic . However , the func - tional consequences of actin Nt - acetylation remain largely un - explored , and the identity of actin ’ s NAT has remained a mystery . Results NAA80 Nt - Acetylates Actin . Nat6 / Fus - 2 / NAA80 was previously described as a putative NAT ( 16 ) , based on sequence analysis that suggested the presence of a NAT - specific ( GCN5 ) - related N - acetyltransferase ( GNAT ) - fold ( Fig . S1 A ) , although no spe - cific substrate had been described . Here we studied the Nt - acetylation activity of NAA80 toward a representative selection of peptides , revealing a marked preference for peptides with Significance More than 80 % of human proteins are N - terminal ( Nt ) – acetylated during translation . In contrast , actin , the most abundant protein in the cytoplasm of animal cells , is Nt - acetylated posttranslationally and following a unique multistep mechanism that has remained poorly characterized . Here , we describe the discovery of actin ’ s N - terminal acetyltransferase ( NAT ) , NAA80 . We further demon - strate that actin Nt - acetylation plays essential roles in filament assembly , cytoskeleton organization , and cell motility , resulting in a net increase in the ratio of monomeric to filamentous actin and fewer lamellipodia and filopodia . These effects converge to reduce cell hypermotility . This work establishes the role of Nt - acetylation for the most abundant cytoskeletal protein in animals and reveals a NAT acting posttranslationally and on a single dedicated substrate .

S1 B ) . This preference for the DDDI substrate peptide and EEEI as the second best was observed both in NAA80 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells ( Fig . 1 A ) and in recombinantly expressed and purified NAA80 ( Fig . S1 B ) . Among all the proteins expressed in animals , these N termini uniquely correspond to those of cyto - plasmic β - and γ - actin , respectively , after the intermediate step of posttranslational cleavage of the N - terminal acetylmethionine ( Fig . S1 C ) ( 17 ) . NAA80 - eGFP expressed in human HAP1 cells displayed a dif - fuse cytosolic distribution ( Fig . 1 B ) and , contrary to most NATs , did not associate with ribosomes ( Fig . S1 D ) ( 8 , 18 ) , suggesting that it targets its substrate ( s ) posttranslationally . To identify NAA80 - specific substrates in cells , we generated two HAP1 NAA80 - KO cell lines ( KO1 and KO2 ) using the CRISPR / Cas9 system ( Fig . S2 A ) . Phosphoimaging of NAA80 KO1 cell lysates treated with purified NAA80 and isotope - labeled [ 14 C ] - acetyl CoA revealed a single band at ∼ 43 kDa , corresponding to the expected molecular mass of actin ( Fig . 1 C ) . Actin ’ s identity was confirmed using N - terminal proteomics ( 9 , 19 ) by quantitatively assessing the Nt - acetylation status of 402 unique N termini from control and NAA80 KO1 cell lysates . Only peptides corresponding to the fully processed N termini of β - and γ - actin showed altered Nt - acetylation levels in KO cells ( Fig . S2 B and Table S1 ) . No other proteins , including Arps ( ARPC2 , CAZA2 , TPM1 , and TPM4 ) , displayed any difference between control and KO1 cells ( Table S1 ) . This can be explained by the fact that the N termini of these proteins do not match NAA80 ’ s substrate specificity . The lack of matching substrate sequence also applies to other Arps , including all isoforms of the Arp2 / 3 complex , capping protein , VASP , my - osin , tropomyosin , and formin . Furthermore , both actin isoforms were 100 % and 0 % Nt - acetylated in control and NAA80 KO1 cells , respectively . Isoform - and Nt - acetylation – specific actin an - tibodies recognized an ∼ 43 - kDa band in control but not NAA80 KO1 cells ( Fig . 1 D and E ) . The Ac - β - actin and Ac - γ - actin antibody signals reappeared in KO cell lysates transfected with NAA80 ( Fig . 1 E ) but not in cells transfected with a catalytically inactive mutant , NAA80mut ( W105F , R170Q , G173D , Y205F ) ( Fig . 1 E and Fig . S3 ) , confirming that catalytically active NAA80 Fig . 1 . NAA80 Nt - acetylates β - and γ - actin .

The samples were probed with Ac - β - actin , Ac - γ - actin , pan - actin , V5 , and GAPDH antibodies . ( F ) Actin acetylation is eliminated in NAA80 - KO cells and restored upon reexpression of active NAA80 . HAP1 control cells were transfected with an empty eGFP vector , and NAA80 KO1 cells were additionally transfected with NAA80 - eGFP or NAA80mut - eGFP and stained with Ac - β - actin or Ac - γ - actin antibodies and analyzed by IF . The general presence of F - actin in the analyzed cells was visualized by Rhodamine phalloidin staining ( Bottom Row ) .

Of note , the Ac - β - actin is a weaker antibody in our hands than Ac - γ - actin . Both signals are almost equally strong in rescue experiments ( Fig . 1 D and E ) , suggesting a more effective rescue for β - actin and thus confirming the substrate specificity of NAA80 we observed in our in vitro experiments ( Fig . 1 A and Fig . S1 B ) . These results were corroborated for both KO cell lines at the single - cell level by im - munofluorescence ( IF ) analysis ( Fig . 1 F and Fig . S3 ) , showing that only control cells and NAA80 - eGFP – transfected NAA80 - KO cells were positive for Ac - β - actin and Ac - γ - actin antibody staining . Actin Nt - Acetylation Controls Cell Motility . Next , we explored the impact of actin Nt - acetylation in cells . Since the actin cytoskeleton is a major factor in cell motility ( 20 ) , we tested HAP1 control and NAA80 - KO cells in several independent migration assays . We found that the lack of actin Nt - acetylation resulted in increased motility of HAP1 NAA80 - KO cells . In wound - healing assays , NAA80 KO1 cells closed the gap ∼ 12 h faster than control cells ( Fig . 2 A and B ) , with cell - front velocity increasing from 6 . 4 ± 0 . 7 to 10 ± 0 . 6 μ m / h ( Fig . 2 C ) . We observed similar results for both KO cell lines in an IncuCyte ZOOM system for live - cell imaging , showing an increase of cell - front velocity from 7 to 9 μ m / h and 11 μ m / h for NAA80 KO1 and KO2 cells , respectively ( Fig . S4 and Movie S1 ) . To investigate the migratory properties of single cells , we performed a chemotaxis assay by seeding cells on a transparent porous membrane in medium containing 1 % FBS . Cells were attracted to the bottom side by a medium containing 10 % FBS , and the number of migrating cells was normalized to the growth rates of each cell line ( Fig . S4 ) . NAA80 KO1 cells showed an ∼ 50 % increase in chemotactic motility compared with control cells ( Fig . 2 D ) . In addition to the chemotactic assay for directed migration , we also measured random cell migration in parallel wells in which both chambers contained 10 % FBS . In this assay , we also observed increased random motility of NAA80 KO1 cells ( Fig . 2 E ) , consistent with an increased capacity of these cells to migrate . Similar results were obtained with NAA80 KO2 cells ( Fig . S4 D and E ) . Taken together these data demonstrate that cells deficient in actin Nt - acetylation have increased motility . Actin Nt - Acetylation Affects Cytoskeletal Morphology . The actin cytoskeleton regulates not only cell motility but also cell shape and morphology ( 2 ) . Thus , we compared the morphology of the actin cytoskeleton in HAP1 control and NAA80 - KO cells by phalloidin staining . Based on the hypermotility phenotype of NAA80 - KO cells , we were specifically interested in the formation of cell protrusions , such as filopodia and lamellipodia , that are usually linked to cell motility . As anticipated , NAA80 - KO cells displayed an increase in both the number and length of filopodia - like structures ( Fig . 3 A – D ) . These cells showed an approximately fourfold increase in the number of filopodia - like structures , de - fined as phalloidin - stained protrusions with a length ≥ 0 . 5 μ m ( Fig . 3 C ) . The average filopodia length increased from 1 μ m in control cells to 5 μ m in NAA80 - KO cells ( Fig . 3 D ) . Confirming the spec - ificity of this phenotype , the reexpression of NAA80 in NAA80 - KO cells reduced the number of filopodia - like structures nearly to control levels , whereas the expression of the catalytically inactive mutant NAA80mut did not ( Fig . S5 A ) . As in the other experi - ments described above , the NAA80 KO2 clone showed similar behavior ( Fig . S5 B ) . Consistent with the apparent elevated num - ber of filamentous actin structures in NAA80 - KO cells , we ob - served a significant reduction in the ratio of globular - actin to filamentous - actin ( G / F ) ( 21 ) , from 0 . 73 in HAP1 control cells to 0 . 55 in NAA80 KO1 cells ( Fig . 3 E ) . This effect was reversed by the expression of wild - type NAA80 but not NAA80mut in both NAA80 - KO cell lines ( Fig . S5 C ) , demonstrating that NAA80 - dependent actin Nt - acetylation directly impacts the transition between G - and F - actin . Since we observed a hypermotility phenotype for NAA80 - KO cells ( Fig . 3 ) , we quantified the number of cells showing at least one distinguishable lamellipodium supported by microspikes or filo - podia - like structures . To efficiently study these cell protrusions in HAP1 cells , which typically grow in clusters , we included only cells at the borders of the clusters in quantifications . These were scored as either positive or negative for the presence of lamellipodia . In agreement with the increased cell - front velocity in the motility assays , we observed that twice as many NAA80 - KO cells as control cells formed lamellipodia ( 32 vs . 16 % ) ( Fig . 3 F – H ) . These results further emphasize the importance of actin Nt - acetylation in the control of cytoskeletal dynamics . Nt - Acetylation – Dependent Actin Polymerization and Stability . To address the mechanism behind the altered cytoskeleton organi - zation phenotypes of NAA80 - KO cells , we analyzed the recovery rates of cytoskeletal structures in cells treated with the actin - depolymerizing drug latrunculin A ( LatA ) . Within 60 min of LatA treatment the actin appeared to be fully depolymerized in control and NAA80 - KO cells , and washout of the drug resulted in the recovery of actin filament structures , but the time of recovery was significantly delayed for NAA80 - KO cells compared with control cells ( Fig . S6 ) , consistent with a direct role of actin Nt - acetylation in actin polymerization . We next explored the in vitro effect of actin Nt - acetylation on the polymerization / depolymerization properties of actin alone or Fig . 3 .

Cytoplasmic actin ( a mixture of β and γ isoforms ) was purified from control and NAA80 - KO cells , and the presence or absence of Nt - acetylation was verified by Western blotting ( Fig . 4 A ) ( 22 ) . The time course of actin polymerization measured using the pyrene - actin polymerization assay revealed no significant Fig . 4 . Actin Nt - acetylation affects filament elongation and depolymerization . ( A ) Cytoplasmic actin ( a mixture of β and γ isoforms ) purified from wild - type and NAA80 - KO cells was analyzed by SDS / PAGE and Western blotting using isoform - and Nt - acetylation – specific Ac - β - actin and Ac - γ - actin antibodies . Nt - acetylated α - skeletal actin ( 15 ) is shown as reference . ( B ) The polymerization rate of β / γ - actin alone is unchanged with or without Nt - acetylation . Data are shown as the average curve from five independent experiments ( as indicated ) , with SD error bars in lighter color ( Ac - actin , blue ; non – Ac - actin , red ) .

( F ) The concentration dependence of polymerization rates of actin assembly induced by mDia2 ( nucleation and barbed - end capping ) is unchanged with or without Nt - acetylation ( see also Fig .

( G ) The concentration dependence of polymerization rates of actin assembly induced by mDia1 ( nucleation and barbed - end elongation ) is > twofold faster for Ac - actin ( blue ) than for non – Ac - actin ( red ) ( see also Fig . S7 D ) . ( H ) The elongation rate of filament seeds by mDia1 from profilin1 - actin is ∼ 35 % faster for Ac - actin ( blue ) than for non – Ac - actin ( red ) . For both actins , the elongation rate of mDia1 from profilin1 - actin is faster than the elongation rate of β / γ - actin seeds alone ( shown as controls ) . ( I ) In contrast , barbed - end elongation by mDia1 from profilin2 - actin is unchanged for non – Ac - actin ( red ) and is reduced ∼ 40 % for Ac - actin ( blue ) relative to the elongation rate of β / γ - actin seeds . Rates are reported as the mean ± SEM of the number of independent experiments indicated in each panel . 4402 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1718336115 Drazic et al . difference in the polymerization rate of acetylated β / γ - actin ( Ac - actin ) vs . nonacetylated β / γ - actin ( non – Ac - actin ) ( Fig . 4 B ) . How - ever , the elongation of 1 . 5 - μ M β / γ - actin filament seeds ( ± Nt - acetylation ) in the presence of 0 . 5 - μ M β / γ - actin monomers ( i . e . , above the critical concentration for monomer addition at the barbed end but below that of the pointed end ) was more than twofold faster for Ac - actin than for non – Ac - actin ( Fig . 4 C ) . In contrast , the depolymerization rate of 0 . 1 - μ M filament seeds ( i . e . , below the critical concentration of both the pointed and barbed ends ) was approximately twofold faster for Ac - actin than for non – Ac - actin , suggesting that , at least in the absence of other factors , actin filament structures formed by non – Ac - actin might be more stable ( Fig . 4 D ) . Because both elongation and depolymerization are approximately twofold faster for Ac - actin than for non – Ac - actin , whereas total polymerization is unchanged , nucleation seems to be mostly unaffected by Nt - acetylation . In cells , nucleation is greatly enhanced by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 3 , 5 ) . However , we also found no difference in the relative polymerization rate of Ac - actin and non – Ac - actin induced by Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4 E and Fig . S7 A and B ) . We next analyzed two formins , mDia1 and mDia2 , that , while closely related in sequence , have very different actin - assembly properties . We observed no significant difference in the relative polymerization rates of Ac - actin and non – Ac - actin in - duced by mDia2 ( Fig . 4 D and Fig . S7 A and C ) , a formin that has strong nucleation but poor elongation activity ( 23 , 24 ) . In contrast , for mDia1 , which has both strong nucleation and strong elongation activities ( 23 , 24 ) , the polymerization rate was approximately twofold higher for Ac - actin than for non – Ac - actin ( Fig . 4 G and Fig . S7 A and D ) . Because Nt - acetylation – dependent differences appear to be emphasized during formin - mediated elongation , we analyzed the role of profilin ( isoforms 1 and 2 ) , known to virtually stop pointed - end elongation of actin alone while dramatically ac - celerating barbed - end elongation by formins ( 24 ) . As expected , mDia1 accelerated the elongation rate of β / γ - actin filament seeds from profilin1 - actin compared with the elongation of seeds from actin alone , but this effect was greater for Ac - actin than for non – Ac - actin ( Fig . 4 H ) . Curiously , no significant difference was ob - served with profilin2 - actin ( Fig . 4 I ) , suggesting that mDia1 processes profilin1 - actin more efficiently than profilin2 - actin . We note , how - ever , that these assays detect the incorporation into filaments of the small fraction of pyrene - labeled actin , which binds profilin with weaker affinity than unlabeled actin ( 24 ) , so the effects of profilin may be far more pronounced than indicated by the bulk assays . Together , these results suggest that the differences in filament as - sembly between Ac - actin and non – Ac - actin emanate mainly from an Nt - acetylation – dependent increase in the rates of filament de - polymerization and elongation , whereas nucleation appears to be mostly unaffected ( spontaneous or Arp2 / 3 complex - driven ) . Discussion The identity of the actin NAT has been a longstanding question since the unique processing of Dictyostelium and mammalian ac - tins was discovered in 1981 and 1983 , respectively ( 15 , 25 ) . Based on their N - terminal sequences after processing ( 26 ) , the other actin isoforms , e . g . , skeletal and cardiac muscle α - actin and smooth muscle α - and γ - actin , are also likely to be Nt - acetylated by NAA80 ( Fig . S1 C ) . Furthermore , the effects of actin Nt - acetylation likely vary among cell types . For instance , in muscle cells , where actin accounts for ∼ 20 % of the total cellular protein , Nt - acetylation could predictably have rather dramatic effects in muscle contrac - tion and actomyosin force generation ( 27 , 28 ) . We found that Nt - acetylation is responsible for pronounced and opposite effects on actin filament depolymerization and elonga - tion dynamics , including formin - induced elongation . Thus , while Ac - actin elongates faster , it also depolymerizes faster , suggesting that cytoskeletal structures consisting of non – Ac - actin may last longer . In contrast , actin filament nucleation was mostly un - affected by Nt - acetylation . We note that filament nucleation is a one - time reaction , whereas both elongation and depolymerization are repetitive reactions that thus could be more sensitive to the cumulative effects of Nt - acetylation . The in vitro effects observed here with several actin assembly factors ( 4 , 5 , 24 ) likely converge to produce the global effects on cell migration and monomeric - to - filamentous actin ratios described above ( 2 ) . Due to actin ’ s broad spectrum of cellular activities , its specific N - terminal processing , and its evolution from bacterial precursors such as FtsA and MreB ( 29 – 31 ) , we asked whether a correlation existed between actin ’ s unique N - terminal sequence and the ex - pression of NAA80 . Generally , eukaryotic proteins with N - ter - minal sequences beginning with Met - Asp or Met - Glu are Nt - acetylated cotranslationally by NatB ( Fig . 5 A ) ( 32 ) . Actin , however , is additionally processed posttranslationally by a unique N - terminal maturation pathway involving a still unidentified aminopeptidase , which , as we show here , is followed by NAA80 - mediated Nt - acetylation ( Fig . 5 A ) . Interestingly , sequence analysis reveals that the expression of NAA80 is highly correlated with the conservation of this unique actin N - terminal processing mecha - nism . For instance , an NAA80 ortholog exists in some amoebozoa , including Dictyostelium discoideum ( Fig . 5 B and Table S2 ) , which share the actin N - terminal processing mechanism present in ani - mals ( 25 , 33 ) . In contrast , NAA80 is absent in fungi and plants , which have either a different actin N terminus or use a different N - terminal processing mechanism ( 32 , 34 ) . Thus , NAA80 appears to have coevolved with the actin sequence in species requiring an acetylated and highly acidic actin N terminus for proper function ( 29 , 35 ) . This offers the possibility to control actin Nt - acetylation in animals by targeting a single gene , NAA80 . The ability to control actin Nt - acetylation enables us to study in more detail the consequences of this modification at the molec - ular , cellular , and organismal levels in the future . Here we have Fig . 5 . NAA80 expression is evolutionarily linked to a unique processing mechanism of actin ’ s N terminus .

It is possible that adhesion and contraction are directly or indirectly influenced by the pres - ence of actin ’ s Nt - acetyl group and thus Nt - acetylation may ex - plain the overall impact on cell migration . Further studies will also shed light on the molecular mechanisms for the observed differ - ences described here in actin polymerization by actin alone or driven by formin . Actin Nt - acetylation could directly decrease the affinity of actin toward formin , as was shown for other protein – protein interactions dependent on Nt - acetylation ( 13 ) . The en - hanced actin filament stability and the slower depolymerization rate of purified non – Ac - actin suggest that the actin filament structure itself could be affected . The lack of the Nt - acetyl group and a subsequently altered filament structure could potentially be sterically unfavorable for actin polymerization and depolymeri - zation . Previous studies on yeast actin have shown that the stability of actin filament structures is affected by the negative charge density at the N terminus . Removing the two negatively charged acidic residues in yeast actin ( MDSE ) caused an increase in the number of actin strands forming filament bundles ( 36 ) . Comparison of nonmuscle β - actin and γ - actin showed that β - actin has increased polymerization but reduced depolymerization rates . These two isoforms basically differ only in their N termini , with aspartate having a lower pK than glutamate and β - actin thus having a higher negative - charge density ( 37 ) , supporting the importance of the N terminus for actin functionality . The fact that the removal of the Nt - acetyl group in NAA80 - KO cells in this study decreases the negative charge density may explain the phenotypes ob - served in vitro as well as in vivo . In this study , the functional and cellular roles of the most conserved actin modification in animals have been revealed . We have also gained a deeper understanding of the cellular roles of Nt - acetylation . In contrast to the established NAT enzymes often acting on the ribosomes and targeting large groups of substrates ( 8 ) , NAA80 is a specific posttranslational eukaryotic NAT . An accompanying paper defines structural and cellular determinants essential for this specificity towards actin ( 38 ) . Such a mode of action resembles the enzymes of other major protein modifica - tions such as protein phosphorylation and lysine acetylation , and future studies will reveal whether actin Nt - acetylation also rep - resents a key entry point for cellular regulation . Materials and Methods Detailed procedures for cell culturing , microscopy analysis , recombinant protein purification , actin purification , pyrene - based polymerization and depolymerization assays , Nt - acetylation assays , and Western blot analysis are described in SI Materials and Methods and Table S3 .
