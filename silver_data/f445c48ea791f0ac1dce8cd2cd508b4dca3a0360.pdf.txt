Auxilin is a clathrin binding protein ( Holstein et 2 Department of Biochemistry University of Texas Health Science Center al . , 1996 ; Greener et al . , 2000 ) and is a member of the DnaJ class of proteins that contains a conserved J do - at San Antonio San Antonio , Texas 78245 main ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ) . Similar to other DnaJ homologs , auxilin binds to Hsc70 via its J domain and 3 Marine Biological Laboratory Woods Hole , Massachusetts 02543 stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsc70 , which then greatly enhances the release of clathrin from CCVs ( Unge - wickell et al . , 1995 ; Holstein et al . , 1996 ) . Auxilin homo - logs have now been identified in several species , includ - Summary ing yeast , C . elegans , and mammals ( Gall et al . , 2000 ; Greener et al . , 2000 , 2001 ; Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ; Umeda We have examined the roles of Hsc70 and auxilin in the uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) during et al . , 2000 ; Lemmon , 2001 ) . Mammalian isoforms in - clude the neuron - specific auxilin 1 and the ubiquitously neuronal endocytosis . We identified two peptides that inhibit the ability of Hsc70 and auxilin to uncoat CCVs expressed auxilin 2 ( also called G - cyclin associated ki - nase , or GAK ; Ahle and Ungewickell , 1990 ; Ungewickell in vitro . When injected into nerve terminals , these pep - tides inhibited both synaptic transmission and CCV et al . , 1995 ; Kanaoka et al . , 1997 ; Kimura et al . , 1997 ; Greener et al . , 2000 ; Umeda et al . , 2000 ) . The amino acid uncoating . Mutation of a conserved HPD motif within the J domain of auxilin prevented binding to Hsc70 in sequences of auxilin are somewhat divergent between species . However , all auxilin homologs have in common vitro and injecting this mutant protein inhibited CCV uncoating in vivo , demonstrating that the interaction both a clathrin binding domain and a J domain ( Gall et al . , 2000 ; Greener et al . , 2000 , 2001 ; Pishvaee et al . , of auxilin with Hsc70 is critical for CCV uncoating . These studies establish that auxilin and Hsc70 partici - 2000 ; Lemmon , 2001 ) . Based on these biochemical observations , a plausible pate in synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons and that an interaction between these proteins is required for model for CCV uncoating is that auxilin first is targeted to CCVs by its clathrin binding domain . Hsc70 would CCV uncoating . then be recruited to the CCV by binding to the J domain of auxilin ; this interaction then could stimulate the Introduction ATPase activity of Hsc70 to release clathrin monomers from CCVs . Recent experimental tests in non - neuronal The rapid consumption of synaptic vesicles during neu - rotransmitter release necessitates a local mechanism cells are consistent with this model ( Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ; Greener et al . , 2001 ; Zhao et al . , 2001 ) .

We define a motif within auxilin that mediates the sis . Formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) in pre - synaptic terminals requires the coordinated action of interaction of this protein with Hsc70 , and demonstrate that this interaction is essential for CCV uncoating and manyclathrin - associatedproteins , includingclathrinas - sembly proteins , dynamin , and other accessory proteins synaptic transmission in vivo . Thus , it appears that auxi - lin and Hsc70 are required for synaptic vesicle recycling ( Heuser and Reese , 1973 ; Maycox et al . , 1992 ; Takei et al . , 1996 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ; Morgan et al . , 1999 ; Morgan in presynaptic nerve terminals . et al . , 2000 ; Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ) . In contrast , very little is known about how these synaptic CCVs are Results uncoated .

Preventing CCV uncoating in vivo should prevent the replenishment of CCVs to the releasable pool and , therefore , inhibit neurotransmitter release . Neurotransmitter release was measured by monitoring the initial rate of rise ( slope ) of postsynaptic potentials ( PSPs ) evoked by low frequency ( 0 . 03 Hz ) presynaptic stimulation . Injection of CytC pep ( Figures 2A and 2B ; Table 1 ) inhibited neurotransmitter release without affecting pre - synaptic action potentials . Very similar effects also were observed following injection of Auxilin pep ( Figures 2E and 2F ; Table 1 ) . In both cases , the inhibition of neuro - transmitter release was reversible , indicating that the effectwasnotduetomicroinjectiondamagetothenerveterminal . Given that the peptides were coinjected with a fluorescent dye , it was possible to measure the intra - terminal concentrations of the injected peptides at the point of maximal inhibition of neurotransmitter release . These measurements revealed that both CytC pep and Figure 1 .

Given that CytC uponHsc70 activityinvitroand neurotransmitterrelease pep and Auxilin pep bind directly to Hsc70 , we tested indicate that Hsc70 is essential for maintaining synaptic whether these peptides affect the ability of Hsc70 and transmission . auxilin to uncoat clathrin . Clathrin uncoating can be measured in vitro by adding CytC Pep and Auxilin Pep Inhibit CCV auxilin and Hsc70 to preassembled clathrin cages in Uncoating In Vivo the presence of ATP , and then quantifying the resulting If CytC pep and Auxilin pep inhibit CCV uncoating , then release of clathrin from the cages ( Prasad et al . , 1993 ; terminals injected with these peptides should exhibit an Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ; Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ; Greener increase in CCVs compared to those injected with inert et al . , 2001 ) . Under such conditions , CytC pep caused controlpeptides , suchasRNaseSpepandScramauxilin a dose - dependent inhibition of uncoating ( Figure 1A ; pep . We tested this prediction by injecting terminals Table 1 ) . This is consistent with previously published with CytC pep and Auxilin pep until neurotransmitter work ( Greene et al . , 1995 ) . A control peptide ( RNaseS release was inhibited by (cid:2) 95 % .

Images of terminals injected with CytC Greene et al . , 1995 ) . Similarly , Auxilin pep also inhibited pep and Auxilin pep revealed changes in presynaptic uncoating in vitro , whereas a mutant form of Auxilin pep morphology when compared to images from terminals with scrambled end residues ( Scram auxilin pep ) had injected with RNaseS or Scram auxilin pep ( Figures 3A much less effect on uncoating ( Figure 1B ; Table 1 ) . Thus , and 3D ) . One striking difference was that the terminals both CytC pep and Auxilin pep inhibit uncoating in vitro injected with CytC pep and Auxilin pep each had more by disrupting the interaction of Hsc70 with clathrin CCVs than controls ( Figures 3A and 3D ) .

Thus , the HPD - mediatedinteraction between auxilin and Hsc70 is essential for maintaining neurotransmitter release . We next determined whether auxilin (cid:3) HPD interferes with CCV uncoating . For this purpose , we compared the numbers of coated vesicles in terminals injected with auxilin (cid:3) HPD and wild - type auxilin .

Discussion Hsc70 and Auxilin Mediate CCV Uncoating in Neurons This study establishes a clear role for Hsc70 and auxilin in uncoating of CCVs in presynaptic nerve terminals . Our evidence derives from three different reagents that inhibit uncoating both in vitro and in living nerve termi - nals . One reagent was CytC pep , which was first discov - ered as an Hsc70 substrate that plays a role in antigen presentation ( Lakey et al . , 1987 ) . Because CytC pep binds to the same site on Hsc70 as clathrin , we were abletousethispeptidetoinhibittheinteractionofHsc70withclathrin . This peptide inhibited CCV uncoating both in vitro and in vivo ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ; Table 1 ; Greene et al . , 1995 ) . The specificity of CytC pep for Hsc70 has been well established by affinity chromatography stud - ies ( Lakey et al . , 1987 ; Vanbuskirk et al . , 1989 ) . The control utilized in these studies was RNaseS pep , a complementary peptide that has only a very weak affin - ity for Hsc70 ( Greene et al . , 1995 ) and therefore had no effect on uncoating either in vitro or in vivo ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ; Table 1 ) . A second reagent that we employed wasapeptidefromtheJdomainofauxilinthatcontainedanHPDmotif ( Tsai and Douglas , 1996 ; Han et al . , 2000 ) . Given that the HPD motif is critical for binding of Hsc70 to auxilin ( Figure 4 ) , this peptide was expected to inhibit CCV uncoating by binding to the J domain binding site on Hsc70 and , thereby , inhibiting the interaction of Hsc70 with auxilin . Indeed , this peptide inhibited un - coating both in vitro and in vivo ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ; Table 1 ) . In support of the specificity of this reagent , we found that a peptide in which the HPD motif was scrambled was much less efficient at inhibiting uncoat - Figure 6 . Auxilin (cid:3) HPD Inhibits Neurotransmitter Release ing in vitro and had no effect on synaptic transmission ( A ) Time course of inhibition of neurotransmitter release by auxilin in vivo ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ; Table 1 ) .

Further , this mutant protein competitively inhibited uncoating mediated by wild - typeauxilininvitro ( Figure5 ; Table1 ) . Invivo , auxilin (cid:3) HPD displayed the largest relative inhibition of uncoat - area associated with various membrane compartments in the nerve terminal ( Burns et al . , 1998 ; Morgan et al . , ing , with 500 % more coated vesicles in terminals in - jected with auxilin (cid:3) HPD versus wild - type auxilin ( Fig - 1999 ) and compared these measurements to those ob - tained from terminals injected with wild - type auxilin . ures 6 and 7 ) . The specificity of auxilin (cid:3) HPD in vivo was well supported by the finding that the wild - type This analysis revealed that the loss in synaptic vesicle membrane area seen in the presence of auxilin (cid:3) HPD protein , which differed by only three amino acids , had a minimal effect on synaptic transmission ( Figures 6 and was paralleled by a quantitatively similar increase in plasma membrane area , while endosomal area was un - 7 ; Table 1 ) . The consistency between the biochemical , functional , changed ( Figure 7D ) . Synaptic vesicle diameters were unchanged in terminals injected with auxilin (cid:3) HPD and structural effects produced by three different re - agents that interfere with Hsc70 / auxilin in vitro suggests ( 70 . 3 (cid:1) 0 . 1 nm ; n (cid:6) 700 SVs ) compared to those injected with auxilin ( 70 . 4 (cid:1) 0 . 1 nm ; n (cid:6) 700 SVs ) . These results that all three reagents also interfere with Hsc70 / auxilin in vivo .

Thus , the HPD - Such changes would be predicted from a blockade of Neuron296 Figure 7 .

In contrast , genetic dis - ruption of Hsc70 - 4 did not affect synaptic vesicle recy - rate ( 0 . 03 Hz ) , indicatingthatCCV uncoatingisimportant for vesicle recycling in nerve terminals undergoing mod - cling in Drosophila ( Bronk et al . , 2001 ) . This negative result probably arose because some other protein— est levels of activity . This is consistent with studies showing that clathrin assembly also occurs during low such as Hsp70 ( which was upregulated following chronic disruption of Hsc70 - 4 ) or one of the other iso - rates of activity ( Morgan et al . , 1999 , 2000 ) .

Auxilin pep and CytC pep were both capable of completely inhibiting neurotrans - pool whether the nerve terminal is undergoing modest or heavy levels of activity . mitter release ( Figure 2 ) , yet produced only a modest depletion of synaptic vesicles ( Figure 3 ) . Therefore , it is Although the mechanisms involved in assembling clathrin coats and in budding clathrin - coated vesicles likely that auxilin pep and CytC pep affected synaptic vesicle exocytosis in addition to their effects on CCV from the presynaptic plasma membrane have received substantial experimental attention ( De Camilli et al . , uncoating .

Our work provides evidence that auxilin and Hsc70 play roles in this process . Our results are consis - teins , that are involved in neurotransmitter release ( Chamberlain and Burgoyne , 1997 ) . In support of this tent with the model that auxilin serves to recruit Hsc70 to CCVs and stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 possibility , arecent reportindicates thatHsc70 iscritical for evoked neurotransmitter release in Drosophila and to dissociate clathrin from the CCV .
