Over the last years , civic technology projects have emerged around the world to advance open government and community action . Although Computer - Supported Cooperative Work ( CSCW ) and Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) communities have shown a growing interest in researching issues around civic technologies , yet most research still focuses on projects from the Global North . The goal of this workshop is , therefore , to advance CSCW research by raising awareness for the ongoing challenges and open questions around civic technology by bridging the gap between researchers and practitioners from different regions .

In the last two decades , a large number of political innovations [ 48 ] , powered by digital technologies , have emerged to scale up citizen participation and to promote new forms of governance . As noted by Linders [ 22 ] , there is a plethora of competing labels for these initiatives : collaborative government [ 28 ] , citizen sourcing [ 51 ] , wiki government [ 33 ] , government as a platform [ 35 ] , do - it - yourself government [ 25 ] , participatory civics [ 54 ] , digital civics [ 34 ] , etc . Among them , the term civic technologies ( or simply civic tech ) , proposed in a report by the Knight Foundation [ 36 ] and motivated by the expected civic outcome of such technological approaches , has gained popularity in recent years . The phenomenon of civic technologies has resulted in increasing research on different projects around the world . The first works , inspired by initiatives in the United States and Europe , focused on operationalizing the notion of civic tech and mapping existing projects into component areas [ 8 , 12 , 13 , 31 , 44 , 46 , 49 ] . This early literature—originated primarily in the business and social innovation sectors—was followed by academic works to develop knowledge on civic tech and its relation to public libraries [ 4 ] , digital data analytics [ 2 , 24 ] , hackathons [ 17 , 45 ] , and urban collaborative governance [ 14 ] . Recent research has started to offer a broader perspective of the civic tech movement by covering case studies from geographical regions of the Global South , including Latin America [ 37 , 40 , 41 ] , Africa [ 7 , 37 , 38 ] , Asia [ 18 , 50 ] and Oceania [ 39 ] . Although most works about civic technologies have come from social and political sciences , there has been an increase in the scholarship within the CSCW research community that examines the role of the Workshop CSCW ' 20 Companion , October 17 – 21 , 2020 , Virtual Event , USA 538 Internet , social media , and ICTs on supporting civic engagement [ 3 ] , mobilizing communities [ 43 ] , and examining civic data practices [ 1 , 5 , 21 , 30 ] and software development processes in civic projects [ 20 , 47 ] . Nevertheless , there is still a tension in community technologies between novelty contributions and sustained engagement . As explained by Liu et al . [ 23 ] , the broader HCI and CSCW literature has traditionally emphasized technological innovation rather than social impact . Similarly , previous work has suggested considering not only the results of civic technologies but also community practices [ 15 , 19 , 27 ] . Thus , we observe the disconnection between research and practice as an opportunity for future CSCW research [ 42 ] . By bringing practitioners and members from different disciplines , we aim to bridge experiences about civic technologies from both sides . Civic technologies are constrained by their context [ 16 ] , such as infrastructure [ 53 ] , history of the communities [ 11 ] , local practices [ 32 ] , and perceived trust [ 9 ] . Therefore , it is important to identify how these elements affect the design , implementation , adoption , and maintenance of civic tech in the targeted region . Up to now most of the CSCW research on civic technologies focused on projects from the Global North . This difference between Global North and South was measured in a recent systematic review literature of more than 100 papers about civic technologies : over 85 % were designed and implemented in the Global North [ 42 ] . This inequality motivates the need to promote dialogue and collaboration with key players in civic technologies from the Global South . During our workshop , rather than erasing particularities , our goal is to identify common patterns , intersections on the approaches , and similarities in practices to address open challenges . GOAL OF THE WORKSHOP The goal of the workshop is twofold . First , to exchange knowledge and experiences when designing , implementing , deploying and maintaining civic technologies across regions with different infras - tructures , needs , and local histories . Second , to bridge the gap between researchers and civic tech practitioners ( e . g . , policymakers , public officers , social innovators , developers , designers , activists , etc . ) . To this end , our activities will focus on discussing similarities , nuances and differences among civic technologies from different regions and unpacking ongoing research challenges such as : • Civics , Infrastructure , and Local Context – Local conditions that favour the development and deployment of civic technologies – Challenges when adopting existing technologies in new socio - geographic environments – Hybridization of online and offline participation in civic technologies • Civics , Trust and Government – Methods for building trust among civic tech participants and with government bodies – Challenges in making government data available to the public Workshop CSCW ' 20 Companion , October 17 – 21 , 2020 , Virtual Event , USA 539 • Sharing Methods and Strategies – Governance models of civic technologies based on participatory principles – Approaches to ensure project sustainability and the community engagement – Indicators for measuring community health and democratic quality online Lastly , due to the exceptional virtual nature of CSCW 2020 as a response to the global crisis of COVID - 19 , this will be a unique occasion to attract participants from the non - academic sectors and different regions to the venue . We expect to leverage the benefits of the virtual edition to foster the participation of communities that have historically lacked visibility in top - tier academic conferences . Therefore , we intend to give priority voice to civic technology initiatives developed in the Global South . CALL FOR PARTICIPATION We seek participants who engage with research and / or practice focused on developing technologies , supporting civic engagement , or examine the mechanisms that citizens and organizations follow to influence change and decision - making on issues of concern . We will explicitly seek increased participation from researchers and practitioners from geographical regions that have traditionally been underrepresented in these academic venues , in specific from the Global South . We will promote the call for participation in our workshop via online channels such as Twitter , Face - book groups , relevant mailing lists , and by contacting researchers and practitioners who are interested in these topics . In particular , we will contact the organizers of the CHI 2016 Special Interest Group on Digital Civics [ 52 ] , the CSCW 2017 Workshop on Crowdsourcing Law and Policy [ 29 ] and the CSCW 2019 Workshop on Social Technologies for Digital Wellbeing among Marginalized Communities [ 10 ] . Submissions and Review . Applicants will be asked to submit a proposal including previous or ongoing research or practice that reflects on the process , lessons learned , or emerging challenges while exam - ining , designing , or deploying civic technologies . We will give preferential treatment to applications including a 2 - 4 pages position paper ( ACM Extended Abstract format ) on their projects centered on civic technologies . Position papers are not limited to these topics , and broader discussions on digital civics are encouraged . The organizing committee will review the submissions according to their relevance and demonstrated experience with the goals of the workshop . We expect the maximum number of participants to be 25 . WORKSHOP FORMAT Pre - Workshop Activities Since CSCW 2020 will take the form of a virtual conference , we will rely on the technological infrastruc - ture provided by the conference chairs to facilitate workshops of this edition . Holding the workshop Workshop CSCW ' 20 Companion , October 17 – 21 , 2020 , Virtual Event , USA 540 virtually will allow us to reach a broader type of participants , but this format also imposes several challenges such as reduction of depth on communication , reluctance to actively participate , and in - creased levels of distraction depending on the particularities of each participant’s remote environment . To ameliorate some of these challenges , we are planning to send a survey before the workshop to learn about participants’ time zones , identify any particular constraint , and accessibility needs that participants may have . With the results of the survey , we will be able to prepare and respond to any accessibility request and prevent unexpected situations . Additionally , we will make sure of making our workshop materials accessible . Lastly , to help to build community among participants before the workshop , we will create a Slack channel two weeks before the workshop to encourage them to begin a conversation . Agenda Table 1 : Agenda of the workshop Time Activity Outcome 45 min . Introduction and Brief Remarks - 1 hour First Session Civics , Infrastructure , and Local Context Collages 20 min . Break 1 hour Second Session Civics , Trust , and Government Stakeholders Maps 20 min . Break 1 hour Third session Sharing Methods and Strategies Affinity Diagrams After the introductory session , our one - day workshop will be organized in three sessions , in each of which participants will brainstorm and reflect on the different challenges to research and practice of civic technologies ( see Table 1 ) . Participants will work in groups based on the topics that emerge from the position papers received . For the formation of the teams , we will consider the particularities of each position paper , such as target population , methods , the status of the project , and technology used . The organization of the groups will seek a balance between people from different regions and diverse backgrounds to encourage a richer discussion . • Introduction and Brief Remarks : In this introductory session , the workshop’s organizers will conduct brief remarks about the goal and motivation of the workshop . Then , each participant will introduce their work . • First Session | Civics , Infrastructure , and Local Context : In this session , we will encourage discussion on infrastructure and local context , and how those two elements affect the design , implementation , adoption , and maintenance of civic technology . To this end , we will ask par - ticipants to craft a collage in which they describe the existent or lacking infrastructure in the context where they work . To facilitate this activity , we will provide participants with a collage kit . • Second Session | Civics , Trust , and Government : Participants in this session will focus the discussion on how trust in digital civics depends on the sociopolitical context where community engagement takes place . We will encourage them to identify key elements of the configuration of trust among government , citizenry , and local organizations . To this end , we will ask participants to use an adapted version of stakeholder maps to visually communicate who are the key constituents of their ongoing projects and to define hierarchies and key relationships . To Workshop CSCW ' 20 Companion , October 17 – 21 , 2020 , Virtual Event , USA 541 facilitate this process , we will provide participants with digital templates and visual materials on Jamboard . Similarly to the previous session , we will ask each group to present their maps to the rest of the participants . • Third Session | Sharing Methods and Strategies : Building on the discussions of the two previous sessions , we will ask participants in the last session to reflect on how the key elements of infrastructure , local context , and trust of the region where they have been conducting their research have influenced their selection and adaptation of research methods . Through an affinity diagram activity , participants will share and discover what methods and strategies are best suited for conducting research on civic technologies in specific contexts . After the activity , each group will present their affinity diagram to the rest of the participants . Website We have created a website 1 to provide an overview of the workshop , the agenda , and expected 1 cscwcivictechnologies . wordpress . com outcomes . The website will also be used to post the call for submissions and to feature accepted position papers , relevant materials and , after the conclusion of the workshop , a summary of the contributions to the CSCW community .
