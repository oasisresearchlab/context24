This predicts that the DRPLA protein interacts with other pro - teins and that these interactions may play a role in pathogenesis . Here , we describe a protein that binds to the DRPLA product . One of the clones isolated with a yeast two - hybrid system was identified as a human homolog of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate protein of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) . The gene produced two mRNA forms by differential splicing and encoded 552 and 521 amino acids , respectively . The longer form was mainly expressed in the brain and the shorter one in other tissues . The products were phosphorylated upon stimulation of cultured cells with insulin or insulin - like growth factor 1 . Binding of the DRPLA protein to IRSp53 was ascertained by co - immunoprecipitation with antibodies and also by co - localization in perinuclear oval dots in cells expressing engineered constructs . A proline - rich region near the polyglutamine tract of the DRPLA protein and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 were involved in the binding . An extended polyglutamine tract significantly reduced binding ability in yeast cells , but not in in vitro binding assays . The identification of IRSp53 and other proteins detected by the yeast hybrid system predicts that DRPLA functions in a signal transduction pathway coupled with insulin / IGF - 1 . INTRODUCTION Dentatorubral - pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA ) is an auto - somal dominant , progressive neurodegenerative disorder char - acterized by selective neuron death in the dentatofugal and pallidofugal pathways ( 1 ) . It has been shown that DRPLA is caused by CAG repeat expansion ( 2 , 3 ) . The number of CAG repeats in the DRPLA gene is highly polymorphic in the nor - mal population with a range of 7 – 23 , increasing to 49 – 88 in patients ( 2 , 4 ) . The gene is localized to chromosome band 12p13 . 31 and encodes a protein of an apparent molecular size of 160 kDa ( the DRPLA protein ) in which the CAG repeat is translated into a polyglutamine tract ( 5 – 8 ) . The gene is ubiqui - tously expressed and the levels of mRNA and protein expres - sion are not affected by the repeat expansion ( 5 , 6 , 9 ) . In addition to DRPLA , a CAG / glutamine repeat expansion has been detected in seven other inherited neurodegenerative disorders including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) , Huntington’s disease ( HD ) and spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA ) types 1 – 3 , 6 and 7 ( 10 – 16 ) . These disorders exhibit characteristic phenotypes resulting from dysfunction and neuron death in respective regions in the central nervous system , but each responsible gene is fundamentally expressed in ubiquitous tissues . A recent study has demonstrated that overexpression of a relatively short peptide containing an extended polyglutamine tract induces apoptosis in cultured cells , while overexpression of an intact gene product carrying the same extended polyglutamine tract does not ( 17 ) . As pre - dicted based on the anti - parallel b - sheet structure of synthetic polyglutamine tracts ( 18 ) , short peptides with an extended polyglutamine tract form large , poorly soluble aggregates after expression in cultured cells . Nuclear inclusion bodies found in affected brains of patients and mice transgenic for HD , SCA1 , SCA3 and DRPLA seem to be consistent with aggregate for - mation in such experimental systems ( 19 – 21 ) . Most of the products for CAG repeat diseases have been shown to be cleaved by caspases during various apoptotic processes ( 8 , 22 , 23 ) and cleaved products tend to form aggregates if they + To whom correspondence should be addressed .

These results may account for neuron death by an extended polyglutamine tract ; however , little is known about the regional specificity of neu - ron death . Studies on associated proteins are useful to elucidate the pathogenesis of selective neuron death as well as the nor - mal functions of the responsible genes since none has been identified except for the androgen receptor for SBMA ( 10 ) and a calcium channel subunit for SCA6 ( 15 ) . Here we report that the DRPLA protein interacts with a sub - strate of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase . We obtained several clones after screening libraries with the DRPLA protein as bait in a yeast two - hybrid system and one of the clones was identi - fied to be a human homolog of a 53 kDa substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase ( IRSp53 ) . Its hamster homolog has been detected by screening for substrates of the insulin and insulin - like growth factor 1 ( IGF - 1 ) receptors with a mono - clonal antibody ( 24 ) . We characterized human IRSp53 and studied its interaction with DRPLA protein with respect to binding regions and effects of an extended polyglutamine tract . Since IGF - 1 is known to be a trophic or anti - apoptotic factor in the brain ( 25 – 26 ) , our finding is also relevant to the elucidation of IGF - 1 signaling pathways in the brain . RESULTS Isolation of DRPLA - interacting proteins using the yeast two - hybrid system Almost the entire coding region , but without its N - terminal portion , of the normal DRPLA protein was used in screening with the yeast two - hybrid system . A cDNA sequence carrying 10 CAG repeats was fused in - frame with the GAL4 DNA - binding domain to generate pBDDR335 – 1185 , which carried amino acid residues 335 – 1185 of the DRPLA protein includ - ing a polyglutamine tract ( Fig . 1A ) . We screened a human fetal brain Matchmaker cDNA library , which consisted of clones carrying cDNA fused in - frame with the GAL4 activation domain ( AD ) . We finally isolated 30 His + / LacZ + clones out of 1 . 2 · 10 7 Trp + / Leu + auxotrophic transformants . The insert size of these isolated clones ranged from 0 . 5 to 3 . 5 kb . When the 30 clones were sequenced , seven were found to overlap and turned out to be a human homolog of a 53 kDa substrate of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase ( IRSp53 ) by sequence homol - ogy to the previously reported IRSp53 of Chinese hamster ( 24 ) . Others included proteins functioning in the signal trans - Figure 1 . Schematic illustrations of fused proteins and in vitro translation products used in this study .

Here we further characterize human IRSp53 . Characterization of the human IRSp53 gene The longest insert of the isolated IRSp53 clones ( clone 274 ) consisted of 2877 nt , with the exception of the AD portion and a poly ( A ) tail . By single path sequencing , two other isolated clones seemed to have the identical sequence and one carried nucleotides 1 – 2831 . In contrast , the remaining three clones carried 2033 nt , besides the AD and poly ( A ) tail , in which the nucleotide sequence of nt 1 – 1628 was completely identical to that of clone 274 . The open reading frame in the longer form started with ATG at nt 94 , ended at nt 1749 and encoded 552 amino acid residues , while that in the shorter form started at the same position , ended at nt 1656 and encoded 521 amino acids ( Fig . 2A ) . When the amino acid sequences were aligned with the reported hamster IRSp53 sequence , the shorter form resem - bled it in size and sequence ; 94 % of residues were identical after two spaces were inserted . Three putative tyrosine phos - phorylation sites appeared in the N - terminal portion and an SH3 domain similar to those of human proteins VAV2 and yeast BOB1 ( 24 ) localized to positions 407 – 453 of the amino acid sequence ( Fig . 2B ) . Northern blotting using a probe common to the longer and shorter forms of human IRSp53 cDNA visualized a 3 . 0 kb transcript expressed in most tissues examined as well as another 3 . 8 kb transcript mainly expressed in the brain ( Fig . 2A and C ) . Another probe , which was unique to the longer form of cDNA , predominantly hybridized with the 3 . 8 kb transcript ( Fig . 2A and D ) . The size of the two transcripts differed by 0 . 8 kb , which accords with the size difference of the 3 ' - portion of the two cDNA forms . Thus , the two forms seem to be pro - duced by alternative splicing . This was confirmed by RT – PCR with a primer set of a forward primer situated in the common region and a reverse primer situated in the respective unique 3 ' - regions ( data not shown ) . Figure 2 .

To further examine the products , we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a C - terminal portion of IRSp53 by the use of a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion construct ( GST – IRSp53c ; Fig . 1D ) . The antibody also detected multiple prod - ucts in western blotting of the in vitro translation products ( Fig . 3A ) . The largest products generated with the shorter and longer forms migrated at 58 and 63 kDa , respectively , which corre - sponds with the expected size calculated from the first methio - nine residue ( Fig . 3A , lanes S and L ) . The second largest products in the respective lanes were 53 and 58 kDa , appar - ently consistent with the size calculated from the fifth methio - nine residue at position 59 . The antibody also recognized endogenous products in PC12 cells ( Fig . 3A , lane U ) . Since the 53 kDa species was the major product of in vitro translation with the shorter form of human IRSp53 , Met59 seemed prefer - able as an initiation site for translation . Alternatively , multiple species may be generated in a post - translational process . Although IRSp53 is phosphorylated , the multiple species detected here cannot solely be explained by phosphorylation , as described below . Phosphorylation of IRSp53 The total amount of IRSp53 in PC12 cells was not much changed upon stimulation with insulin ( Fig . 3A , lanes 0 , 5 and 120 min ) . Phosphorylated IRSp53 was detected by immuno - precipitation with the anti - IRSp53 antibody followed by west - ern blotting with an anti - phosphotyrosine antibody ( Fig . 3B ) . Endogenous IRSp53 in PC12 cells was phosphorylated with as low as 10 nM insulin or IGF - 1 ( Fig . 3C ) . The phosphorylated form increased to a detectable level 5 min after insulin stimu - lation and continued to accumulate up to 120 min in culture with sodium vanadate , a phosphatase inhibitor . These results are consistent with previous observations in Chinese hamster ovary cells with overexpressed insulin receptor ( 24 ) . The phos - phorylated form migrated at the same distance as the largest form of endogenous IRSp53 in PC12 cells . Since the amount of the 58 kDa species detectable on western blotting with the anti - IRSp53 antibody was not changed by insulin stimulation , only a fraction of that migrating at the 58 kDa position was phosphorylated . Thus , phosphorylation alone does not explain the multiple forms of IRSp53 . A GFP – IRSp53 fusion expressed with cloned cDNA was also phosphorylated under insulin stimulation ( data not shown ) . Through these studies , we confirmed the isolated clone in this study to be phosphory - lated upon insulin stimulation . Interaction of IRSp53 with the DRPLA protein in yeast We verified the interaction of IRSp53 with the DRPLA protein in yeast . As in the screening process , when yeast was co - trans - formed with a plasmid carrying full - length IRSp53 to produce a fusion protein with the AD ( ADIRSp53 ) and pBDDR335 – 1185 , both the HIS3 and LacZ reporter genes were activated ( Fig . 4 ) . The reporter genes were not activated when trans - formed with pADIRSp53 alone or together with either a plas - mid carrying only the GAL4 DNA - binding domain ( BD ) portion or a control plasmid like BD – murine p53 ( data not shown ) . Similarly , transformation with pBDDR335 – 1185 alone or together with a plasmid carrying only the AD portion caused no activation ( data not shown ) . Thus , activation of the reporter genes depended on interaction of the two proteins IRSp53 and DRPLA and did not result from self - activation nor from a single protein product . We then examined which por - tion of the DRPLA protein was involved in binding by the use of a series of deletion plasmids . pBDDR335 – 786 , which expressed a fusion protein of the BD with DRPLA amino acids 335 – 786 , activated the reporter genes after co - transformation of yeast with ADIRSp53 and produced a higher level of b - galactosidase activity ( Fig . 4 ) . In contrast , BDDR676 – 973 and BDDR964 – 1185 showed almost no b - galactosidase activity in co - transformed yeast . Thus , the interacting portion of the DRPLA protein seemed to be localized in the amino acid 335 – 675 region . A construct with an extended polyglutamine tract ( BDDR335 – 786Q + ) still maintained a positive interaction with IRSp53 , but b - galactosidase activities were reduced to one third of those for a similar construct with a normal range of the CAG repeat ( Fig . 4C ) . Co - immunoprecipitation of the DRPLA protein and IRSp53 Interaction between IRSp53 and the DRPLA protein was con - firmed by immunoprecipitation . GFP - tagged IRSp53 produced by transfection in HeLa cells was detectable at the expected position by western blotting with an anti - GFP antibody . The GFP - tagged IRSp53 protein , but not GFP itself , was recovered in precipitates with the anti - DRPLA antibody ( Fig . 5A ) . Con - versely , endogenous DRPLA protein in the cells was immuno - Figure 3 . Characterization of IRSp53 protein . Western blots showing phos - phorylation of endogenous IRSp53 in PC12 cells upon insulin or IGF - 1 stimu - lation . ( A ) Proteins isolated from untreated PC12 cells ( lane U ) were visualized by western blotting with the anti - IRSp53 antibody with parallel runs of in vitro translation products of the shorter and longer forms of human IRSp53 cDNA ( lanes S and L ) as a control for size . PC12 cells were serum starved for 3 h followed by incubation with 10 m M insulin and 500 m M sodium vanadate for 0 , 5 and 120 min . Proteins isolated from the treated cells were vis - ualized with the anti - IRSp53 antibody ( lanes 0 , 5 and 120 min ) . ( B ) The same protein fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti - IRSp53 antibody and detected by western blotting with the anti - phosphotyrosine anti - body . ( C ) PC12 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of insulin or IGF - 1 together with 500 m M sodium vanadate for 120 min , then the proteins were analyzed as in ( B ) . Human Molecular Genetics , 1999 , Vol . 8 , No . 6 951 precipitated with the anti - GFP antibody ( data not shown ) . Moreover , the endogenous IRSp53 and DRPLA proteins in PC12 cells were co - immunoprecipitated with the anti - IRSp53 antibody ( Fig . 5B ) . These results clearly indicate that IRSp53 binds to the DRPLA protein . When PC12 cells were stimulated with insulin , the amount of precipitated DRPLA protein was not significantly changed . Upon insulin stimulation , phosphor - ylated IRSp53 levels increased markedly but the total amount of IRSp53 was not changed , as described above . Thus , phos - phorylation of IRSp53 seemed not to enhance binding to the DRLPA protein . Co - localization of the DRPLA protein and IRSp53 Subcellular localization of the DRPLA protein and IRSp53 in HeLa cells was studied under a confocal microscope . Endog - enous IRSp53 detected with the anti - IPSp53 antibody was dif - fusely distributed in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 6 , panel 2 ) . Endogenous DRPLA protein detected with the anti - DRPLA antibody was mainly localized in nuclei ( Fig . 6 , panel 1 ) , although another anti - DRPLA antibody revealed cytoplasmic localization in brain tissues ( 6 ; see Discussion ) . Most of the GFP - tagged full - length DRPLA protein ( GFP – DRQ14 ) was also localized in the nuclei when it carried a normal range of polyglutamines ( Fig . 6 , panel 3 ) . To enrich the cytoplasmic fraction of the DRPLA protein , we made GFP - tagged con - structs without the nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) at the N - terminal end of the DRPLA protein ( GFP – DRQ14 D N and GFP – DRQ71 D N ; Fig . 1B ) . Such an engineered DRPLA pro - tein with a normal range of polyglutamines was localized in the cytoplasm as small oval dots , although a fraction of the protein still entered the nuclei ( Fig . 6 , panel 9 ) . Although most endog - enous IRSp53 maintained its diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in transfected cells ( Fig . 6 , panel 10 ) , co - localization of GFP – DRQ14 D N with IRSp53 was noted as yellow dots in the peri - nuclear region ( Fig . 6 , panel 11 ) . The GFP - tagged DRPLA protein with an extended polyglutamine tract ( GFP – DRQ71 ) formed nuclear aggregates as previously described ( Fig . 6 , panel 6 ) ( 31 ) . In this condition , endogenous IRSp53 seemed not to participate in aggregate formation ( Fig . 6 , panels 6 – 8 ) . However , the GFP - tagged DRPLA protein without NLS and carrying an extended polyglutamine tract ( GFP – DRQ71 D N ) composed perinuclear and intranuclear oval dots with a diffuse distribution in the nuclei and IRSp53 was involved in aggre - gates in the perinuclear dots . An SH3 domain interacts with a proline - rich region near the polyglutamine tract To identify the region of the DRPLA protein involved in bind - ing to IRSp53 , in vitro translation products from the DRPLA constructs were subjected to an in vitro binding assay using a GST column . GST fusion proteins applied to the column were produced in Escherichia coli with constructs carrying full - length IRSp53 ( GST – IRSp53f ) , its N - terminal portion ( GST – IRSp53n ) and its C - terminal portion ( GST – IRSp53c ) , respec - tively , in addition to GST alone and an unrelated fusion protein ( GST – Bcl2 ) as a control ( Figs 1D and 7A ) . A full - sized DRPLA protein made by in vitro translation bound to GST – IRSp53f and GST – IRSp53c , but not to GST – IRSp53n and control columns ( Fig . 7B – D ) . Although not studied exten - sively , an SH3 domain in the C - terminal portion of IRSp53 Figure 4 . Interaction of IRSp53 with DRPLA protein fragments in the yeast assay . The series of plasmids indicated by BDDR are the constructs used to produce a portion of the DRPLA protein with the normal or expanded polyglutamine tract fused with the BD as illustrated in Figure 1A . Yeast cells were co - transformed with one of the BDDR constructs and AD – IRSp53 . Interaction between the two products was analyzed by growth on a plate containing selection medium without Trp , Leu and His ( A ) , by color development in a b - galactosidase filter assay ( B ) and by quantitative measurements of b - galactosidase activity in disrupted cells ( C ) . The activity was measured in six independent colonies of each transformant and is illustrated as the average ± SD . ND , below background level . The b - galactosidase activity measured with yeast carrying murine p53 and SV40 large T - antigen on the BD and AD constructs is included as a positive control . 952 Human Molecular Genetics , 1999 , Vol . 8 , No . 6 was suggested to be involved in the binding . We then made a series of DRPLA products by in vitro translation of DRPLA constructs which had various sized deletions from the 3 ' - end ( Fig . 1C ) and applied them to the GST – IRSp53c column . Truncated DRPLA proteins produced from DR567 , DR596 and DR749 constructs bound to the GST column but DR516 did not ( Fig . 8A ) . These results suggest that the amino acid 517 – 567 region in the DRPLA protein is involved in binding . Another truncated construct with an internal deletion , DR749del , which had lost amino acid residues 428 – 601 , did not bind to GST – IRSp53c . These results and the binding assay in yeast cells support the proposed binding region . The RPYP - PGP sequence is a consensus proline - rich motif for binding to the SH3 domain ( 32 , 33 ) . There is one completely matched sequence in the proposed binding region , which appears 38 amino acids downstream of the polyglutamine tract , while the proposed binding region contained a few other similar sequences ( Fig . 8C ) . An extended polyglutamine tract modulates binding Contrary to the binding assay in yeast , an extended poly - glutamine tract in DRPLA protein seemed not to significantly affect binding in the GST column assay . Regardless of the size of the polyglutamine tract , DRPLA proteins of full length bound to GST – IRSp53f ( Fig . 7 ) . More careful quantitative assays with truncated proteins showed that products having an extended polyglutamine tract ( DR749Q + and DR696Q + ) bound to GST – IRSp53c to a similar extent as their counter - parts having a normal sized polyglutamine tract ( Fig . 8B ) . However , DR598Q + , the smallest construct still retaining the proposed SH3 binding sequence and an extended poly - glutamine tract , displayed a significantly reduced affinity for IRSp53c compared with that of DR596 ( Fig . 8 ) . Thus , an extended polyglutamine tract in a certain form seemed to obstruct binding to the proposed target region . However , the proline - rich region flanking the consensus binding sequence may serve as an auxiliary binding site , on which an extended polyglutamine tract has little influence . DISCUSSION A growing number of neurodegenerative disorders have been shown to be caused by CAG / glutamine repeat expansion . Despite ubiquitous expression of each CAG repeat disease gene , neuron death occurs in distinctive anatomical areas of the brain , indicating that additional regional factors are involved in Figure 5 . Interaction between the DRPLA protein and IRSp53 verified by immunoprecipitation . ( A ) Interaction between GFP – IRSp53 and the DRPLA protein . We made a construct to produce a fusion protein of GFP with the longer form ofIRSp53 . Protein fractions were isolated from HeLa cellstransfected with the GFP – IRSp53 construct or with a construct carrying GFP alone . A portion of the fractions was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti - DRPLA anti - body and analyzed by western blotting using the anti - GFP antibody with parallel runs of fractions without immunoprecipitation . The single and double filled arrows represent GFP – IRSp53 and GFP , respectively . ( B ) Interaction between endogenous DRPLA and IRSp53 proteins . Protein fractions were isolated from PC12 cells cultured with or without 10 m M insulin and 500 m M sodium vanadate for 120 min . An aliquot of the fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti - IRSp53 antibody or preimmune sera and analyzed by western blot - ting with the anti - DRPLA antibody . The filled arrow represents the size of the endogenous DRPLA protein . Detected bands indicated by open arrows in both ( A ) and ( B ) are the IgG heavy chain . Figure 6 . Subcellular co - localization of IRSp53 with the DRPLA protein . Endogenous DRPLA protein was mainly localized in the nucleus while IRSp53 was localized in the cytoplasm , as shown with specific antibodies stained with a TRITC - conjugated secondary antibody ( red ) ( panels 1 and 2 ) . Co - localization of IRSp53 with DRPLA was ascertained using GFP - tagged DRPLA protein . We transfected HeLa cells with each of the four DRPLA con - structs indicated ( Fig . 1 ) and visualized the DRPLA with GFP ( green ) and IRSp53 with the antibody ( red ) at 24 h after transfection . Panels in the right column ( panels 5 , 8 , 11 and 14 ) were obtained after merging the green and red pictures of the same cell , where yellow shows co - localization of the two mole - cules . A fraction of IRSp53 was co - localized with DRPLA protein as far as it localized in the cytoplasm after removing the nuclear localization signal ( GFP – DRQ14 D N and GFP – DRQ71 D N ) . Human Molecular Genetics , 1999 , Vol . 8 , No . 6 953 the site - specific pattern of neurodegeneration . Several candi - dates having a binding capacity for Huntingtin , the gene prod - uct of the HD gene , have been detected to date and they provide a clue to understanding the normal and pathological functions of the HD gene ( 34 ) . Some of the Huntingtin - binding proteins show a cytoskeletal localization , indicating that Hunt - ingtin may play a role in vesicle trafficking within cells ( 35 ) . A Grb2 - like protein and members of the signaling complex for the epidermal growth factor receptor have been shown to bind through their SH3 domains with Huntingtin . These studies imply that Huntingtin is involved in signal transduction ( 36 , 37 ) . A few proteins interacting with DRPLA protein have been identified , including WW domain - containing proteins which seem to function in the cytoskeleton ( 38 ) . In this report , we have identified an insulin receptor substrate of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) as one of the DRPLA - interacting proteins . Hamster IRSp53 was previously detected during screening for substrates of the tyrosine kinase of the insulin or IGF - 1 recep - tor by use of a monoclonal antibody and its gene was cloned ( 24 ) . Our identification of human IRSp53 is grounded not only in sequence homology to the previously characterized hamster IRSp53 but also in our experiments on phosphorylation . Sev - eral insulin receptor substrates ( IRSs ) have been identified , including IRS - 1 , IRS - 2 , IRS - 3 and IRS - 4 , of which IRS - 1 has been most extensively characterized in the signal transduction pathway from the insulin and IGF - 1 receptors ( 39 ) . Several IRSs form pre - assembled complexes with other members involved in the signal transduction pathway and the complexes may be associated with the actin cytoskeleton ( 40 ) . In contrast , although hamster IRSp53 is clearly demonstrated to be phos - phorylated upon insulin stimulation in experimental systems , IRSp53 has not been fully characterized molecularly and in relation to the signal pathway ( 41 ) . Data presented in this report on the human homolog characterize more fully the IRSp53 gene and product . The human IRSp53 gene generated two transcripts by differ - ential splicing and produced multiple forms of protein distin - guishable by SDS – PAGE not only in cells but also by in vitro translation from each cDNA construct . Although a fraction of IRSp53 is phosphorylated , the multiple forms are not accounted for by phosphorylation alone . We assume that some of the species are generated by utilization of some other methionine as an initiation site , although any methionine in the first 70 amino acid residues is not necessarily situated in a suit - able context for initiation of translation ( 42 ) . The previous study on hamster IRSp53 also reported two forms , 53 and 58 kDa , detectable with the specific antibody and concluded that the 53 kDa form was present in the brain ( 24 ) . Since they isolated only one form of cDNA , corresponding to the shorter form of human cDNA , it is unknown whether differential splicing takes places in rodents . Our study shows that the longer transcript is mostly expressed in the brain and poten - tially encodes a larger protein . Nevertheless , our preliminary study detected a smaller form comparable with the 53 kDa product in rat brain . Thus , more studies will be required to define protein species , especially the brain form , of IRSp53 . Using an antibody raised against the C - terminal portion of DRPLA , we previously detected DRPLA protein mostly in the cytoplasm in brain tissues ( 6 ) . In contrast , another antiserum raised against the GST – DRPLA fusion protein used in this study as well as in a previous study revealed a primarily nuclear localization ( 31 ) . This seems to be accounted for by preferential recognition by the former antibody of phosphor - ylated species ( unpublished data ) . Other laboratories have also reported both cytoplasmic and nuclear localizations of DRPLA protein ( 20 ) . We propose that the DRPLA protein is a shuttle plying across the nuclear membrane . Since IRSp53 is localized Figure 7 . GST column assay showing interaction of the DRPLA protein and IRSp53 .

The DRPLA protein without an NLS was distributed more abundantly in the cytoplasm and co - localization with IRSp53 was ascertained . An extended polyglutamine tract in the DRPLA protein con - siderably reduced binding to IRSp53 in the yeast assay system , but did not significantly affect subcellular co - localization or in vitro binding . The consensus structure for binding to the SH3 domain has been identified to be a PP II helix composed of PXXPX F or F XXPXXP , where F is a basic amino acid resi - due , preferably arginine ( 32 , 33 ) . The RPYPPGP sequence at amino acids 535 – 541 of the DRPLA protein exactly matches the consensus sequence and this is within the essential region for binding in the in vitro binding assay . The binding ability of the smallest construct having the consensus sequence was much influenced by an extended polyglutamine tract , but that for larger constructs having the additional proline - rich sequence was not significantly affected . Thus , the effects of an extended polyglutamine tract seem to depend on the position , the conformational structure or the flanking sequence of the target . Since proteins are correctly folded in the in vivo situa - tion , overall affinity may be maintained , as observed under the microscope , but partially reduced in yeast . IGF - 1 is known to exhibit metabolic and trophic actions in the brain . IGF - 1 is transiently expressed in rat brain during maturation and expression is evident in a specific group of functionally related cerebellar projection neurons , including the deep cerebellar and red nuclei systems ( 43 ) , which is com - parable with the affected areas in DRPLA . Knockout mice for the IGF - 1 gene show defects in the brain with a reduced size , hypomyelination and loss of neurons in particular areas ( 44 ) . Treatment with exogenous IGF - 1 is reported to enhance the survival of neurons in vitro and in vivo by activating several substrates of the receptor ( 24 , 25 , 45 ) . Since our yeast two - hybrid screening reveals several other proteins potentially involved in insulin / IGF - 1 signal transduction , the DRPLA pro - tein may play a role in the neuronal signaling pathway from insulin / IGF - 1 , specifically presenting a docking site for forma - tion of a multiprotein complex . An extended polyglutamine tract may influence the whole conformation of the complex , resulting in an impairment of the IGF - 1 signaling pathway . MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA techniques Plasmid isolation , DNA manipulation and northern blotting were carried out following standard methods described previ - Figure 8 . GST column assay showing the effect of an extended polyglutamine tract on the DRPLA protein . ( A and B ) Various DRPLA constructs ( Fig . 1C ) were in vitro translated with radioisotope to produce truncated products . Products were analyzed by SDS – PAGE to measure the radioactivity ( upper panels ) . Products with a defined radioactivity were applied to columns pretreated with GST – IRSp53c and retained protein was analyzed by SDS – PAGE ( lower panels ) . ( C ) The DRPLA amino acid sequence near the target region . The end - point of each construct is indicated . Since DR567 retained the binding activity while DR516 lost it , the 517 – 567 amino acid sequence ( underlined ) seemed to be a primary target region , where a consensus sequence for binding to the SH3 domain appeared ( double underlined ) . Human Molecular Genetics , 1999 , Vol . 8 , No . 6 955 ously ( 5 , 46 ) . DNA sequences were determined using an auto - mated sequencer with primers situated in the vector portion and also with M13 universal primers after subcloning . In RT – PCR to confirm alternative splicing , human poly ( A ) + RNA from fetal brain , adult brain , liver , kidney and lung ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) was reverse transcribed with Superscript II ( Gibco BRL , Rockville , MD ) and amplified with a sense primer , 5 ' - AAGAGCAGCAGCACGGG , and either of the antisense primers , 5 ' - ACCAACCCAAGAACAAACCA for the shorter form , or 5 ' - TTCTGGATGGGAGGTTGG for the longer form . Plasmid construction All constructs used in this study are illustrated in Figure 1 . The original cDNA clones of the DRPLA gene used in this experi - ment have been described previously ( 2 , 5 ) . All the constructs representing a normal range of repeats carry 10 CAG repeats but encode 14 glutamine residues because of the ( CAGCAA ) 2 sequence ahead of the CAG repeat . To construct a series of plasmids used as bait in the yeast two - hybrid system ( pBDDR335 – 1185 , pBDDR335 – 786 , pBDDR676 – 973 and pBDDR964 – 1185 ) , an Nco I – Nco I fragment ( nt 1239 – 3814 in the DRPLA cDNA sequence ; GenBank accession no . D31840 ) , an Nco I – Bal I ( blunt - ended ) fragment ( 1239 – 2598 ) , a Pst I – Pst I fragment ( 2259 – 3162 ) and a blunt - ended Bam HI – Nco I fragment ( 3125 – 3814 ) isolated from DRPLA cDNA clones were fused in - frame at the Nco I , Nco I / Sma I , Pst I and Sma I sites , respectively , in the GAL4 BD of a yeast two - hybrid vector , pAS2 - 1 ( Clontech ) . A series of plasmids having a trun - cated C - terminus ( pDR749 , pDR696 , pDR596 , pDR567 and pDR516 ) were reported previously ( 8 ) , in which the cDNA portion including the first methionine residue was located downstream of the T3 promoter in a pBluescript SK – vector ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . To construct a plasmid without the polyglutamine tract and flanking regions , pDR749 plasmid DNA was digested with Acc I and Bst EII , blunt - ended and then self - ligated ( pDR749del ) . To construct plasmids carrying extended CAG repeats such as pBDDR335 – 786Q + , pDR749Q + and pDR696Q + , the Acc I – Age I fragment was replaced with the corresponding fragment of pMY1247 , which is a cDNA construct carrying 71 CAG repeats . pDR598Q + was constructed by digestion of pDR749Q + with Age I and Nru I , followed by filling - in with the Klenow fragment and self - ligation . Plasmids for GFP – DRPLA fusion protein ( pGFP – Q14 ) , extended DRPLA protein ( pGFP – Q71 ) and DRPLA proteins without an NLS ( pGFP – Q14 D N and pGFP – Q71 D N ) have been described previously ( 31 ) . To generate a plasmid producing a fusion protein of IRSp53 with GFP ( pGFP – IRSp53 ) , a Sal I – Apa I fragment ( 1 – 1846 ) of the longer form of IRSp53 cDNA was ligated in - frame with the Xho I – Apa I fragment of the expression vector pEGFP - C3 ( Clontech ) . To generate plasmids producing fusion proteins of IRSp53 with GST ( pGST – IRSp53f , pGST – IRSp53n and pGST – IRSp53c ) , a Bsp EI – Eco RV fragment ( 177 – 2887 ) , an Nco I fragment ( 192 – 1194 ) and an Nco I – Eco RV fragment ( 1190 – 2887 ) of the longer form of IRSp53 cDNA were blunt - ended and then inserted in - frame into an Sma I site of the pGEX - 5X vector ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) . For control plasmids used in the yeast two - hybrid system and expression experiments , BD / murine p53 ( pVA3 - 1 ) and AD / SV40 large T antigen were purchased from Clontech and GST – Bcl2 was a generous gift from Dr John C . Reed ( Burnham Institute , La Jolla , CA ) . Yeast two - hybrid system Yeast of the Y190 strain ( MAT a , ura3 - 52 , his3 - 200 , lys2 - 801 , ade2 - 101 , trp1 - 901 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , gal4 D , gal80 D , cyh r 2 , LYS2 : : GAL1 UAS - HIS3 TATA - HIS3 , URA3 : : GAL1 UAS - GAL1 TATA - LacZ ) was used as host in the yeast two - hybrid system . Yeast cells were transformed with DNA following a modified lith - ium acetate transformation protocol and grown in YPD or a selection medium ( 46 , 47 ) . Yeast host cells were first trans - formed with pBDDR335 – 1185 and subsequently with plasmid DNA prepared from a human fetal brain Matchmaker cDNA library fused with the AD ( Clontech ) . The transformants were grown on selection plates without Trp , Leu and His supple - mented with 25 mM 3 - amino - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) ( selection plates ) . Apparent His + clones were picked and their phenotype confirmed by restreaking onto the selection plates and by b - galactosidase filter assay as described below . Candidates were then plated on medium without Leu supple - mented with 10 m g / ml cycloheximide ( Cyh ) to isolate Leu + / Trp – / Cyh r segregants , which had lost the bait plasmid . Finally , plasmid DNA was propagated in E . coli cells ( strain HB101 ) and used in subsequent experiments . Measurement of bbbb - galactosidase activity Filter assays for b - galactosidase were performed in z - buffer ( 100 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM MgSO 4 ) supplemented with 50 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol and 0 . 07 mg / ml 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - b - D - galactoside , after transferring yeast colonies onto Hybond - N nylon membranes ( Amersham , Little Chalfont , UK ) . Filters were then incubated at 37 (cid:176) C for 2 – 4 h until the color developed . b - Galactosidase activities were also measured after disruption of cells as fol - lows . Log phase yeast cells were resuspended in z - buffer and disrupted by freeze – thawing with liquid nitrogen . An aliquot was incubated at room temperature with 0 . 67 mg / ml o - nitroph - enol - b - D - galactopyranoside in z - buffer supplemented with 2 - mercaptoethanol . Subsequently , OD 420 was measured to calcu - late the enzyme activity by the equation of Miller ( 48 ) . Cell culture A rat pheochromocytoma cell line ( PC12 ) was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) with heat - inactivated 10 % horse serum and 5 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U / ml penicillin and 0 . 1 mg / ml streptomycin at 37 (cid:176) C under a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . For stimulation with growth factor , cells were preincubated in serum - free medium for 3 h and then treated in culture medium supplemented with insulin or IGF - 1 at a final concentration of 10 – 6 – 10 – 9 M along with 500 m M sodium vanadate . Culture was continued at 37 (cid:176) C for 2 h unless otherwise indicated . The treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 5 mM EGTA , 500 m M sodium vanadate , 1 . 0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 18 m g / ml aprotinin , 50 m g / ml leupeptin , 1 mM benzamidine and 0 . 7 m g / ml pepstatin ) and the supernatant fraction was obtained by centrifugation . HeLa cells were maintained in the same conditions as for PC12 cells except for using DMEM with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal 956 Human Molecular Genetics , 1999 , Vol . 8 , No . 6 bovine serum and transfected with plasmid DNA by the lipo - fection method ( 49 ) . Detection with antibody A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to human IRSp53 ( anti - IRSp53 ) was raised with the purified product of pGST – IRSp53c and absorbed on GST – Sepharose to diminish the reactivity to GST . Western blotting was performed following a standard method ( 8 , 46 ) . An aliquot containing 30 m g protein was fractionated by SDS – PAGE and transferred onto a nitro - cellulose membrane ( Schleicher & Schuell , Dassel , Germany ) by electroblotting . To detect IRSp53 , membranes were treated with a 1 : 2000 dilution of the anti - IRSp53 antibody , followed by a 1 : 4000 dilution of horseradish peroxide - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Sigma ) . To detect GFP fusion proteins , mem - branes were treated with a 1 : 500 dilution of the monoclonal anti - GFP antibody ( Clontech ) followed by a 1 : 1000 dilution of horseradish peroxide - conjugated rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( Dako , Carpinteria , CA ) . The DRPLA protein was visualized with the anti - DRPLA antibody as previously described ( 8 ) . For immu - noprecipitation , an aliquot containing 500 m g protein was first incubated at 4 (cid:176) C with 10 m l of an indicated antibody for 3 h , then overnight with protein G / protein A – agarose ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) . Precipitates were washed three times and dis - sociated by boiling with the SDS – PAGE buffer and subjected to SDS – PAGE . Co - immunoprecipitated proteins were visual - ized using the anti - GFP antibody , anti - DRPLA antibody or a 1 : 2000 dilution of an anti - phosphotyrosine antibody , RC20H ( Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ) . Confocal microscopy Cells were treated as described previously ( 31 ) . For IRSp53 detection , cells were treated with a 1 : 1000 dilution of anti - IRSp53 antibody , followed by a 1 : 20 dilution of TRITC - conju - gated swine anti - rabbit immunoglobulin ( Dako ) . A fluorescent image was obtained using a confocal microscope ( Fluoview ; Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with an Ar laser with exci - tation at 488 nm and detection at 510 – 530 nm bandpass for GFP or with an He / Ne laser with excitation at 543 nm and detection at 565 to 590 nm bandpass for TRITC . In vitro translation and binding assay In vitro translation was performed using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system ( Promega , Madison , WI ) with plas - mid DNA . Translated products ( 2 m l ) were fractionated by SDS – PAGE and visualized with an antibody . In several exper - iments , products were radiolabeled with [ 35 S ] methionine and detected by autoradiography or quantitatively measured with a phosphorimager ( BAS2000 ; Fuji Film , Tokyo , Japan ) . For binding assays , radiolabeled in vitro translation products were incubated with 10 m g of GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione – Sepharose 4B beads ( Pharmacia ) in HKM solution ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 2 , 142 . 5 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 % NP - 40 ) at 4 (cid:176) C for 2 h and then washed with the HKM solution four times . Proteins bound to the beads were dissociated and analyzed by SDS – PAGE fol - lowed by autoradiography .
