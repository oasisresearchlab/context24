Pollard \ ¶ We determined a crystal structure of bovine Arp2 / 3 complex , an assembly of seven proteins that initiates actin polymerization in eukaryotic cells , at 2 . 0 angstrom resolution . Actin - related protein 2 ( Arp2 ) and Arp3 are folded like actin , with distinctive surface features . Subunits ARPC2 p34 and ARPC4 p20 in the core of the complex associate through long carboxyl - terminal a helices and have similarly folded amino - terminal a / b domains . ARPC1 p40 is a seven - blade b propeller with an insertion that may associate with the side of an actin (cid:222)lament . ARPC3 p21 and ARPC5 p16 are globular a - helical subunits . We predict that WASp / Scar proteins activate Arp2 / 3 complex by bringing Arp2 into prox - imity with Arp3 for nucleation of a branch on the side of a preexisting actin (cid:222)lament . Arp2 / 3 complex , a stable assembly of two actin - related proteins and five novel protein subunits ( 1 ) , is the heart of the machine that generates the branched actin filament net - work responsible for pushing forward the leading edge of motile eukaryotic cells ( 2 , 3 ) . The complex promotes nucleation of actin filaments as 70° branches on the sides of older filaments ( 4 – 6 ) . The complex is inac - tive until stimulated jointly by interaction with WASp / Scar proteins or other nucle - ation - promoting factors ( 7 – 11 ) and with the side of a preexisting filament ( 5 – 7 ) . The filament not only provides the base or “moth - er filament” for the branch but also acts as a secondary activator of nucleation . WASp / Scar proteins require activation through che - motactic signaling pathways that guide the direction of cellular movement ( 12 , 13 ) . WASp promotes binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to the side of a preexisting filament ( 14 ) and may deliver the first actin subunit to the fast - growing barbed end of the new filament ( 15 , 16 ) . Conservation of the sequences of the sev - en subunits of this large ( 220 kD ) complex from protozoa to mammals ( 17 – 19 ) suggests that the encoding genes arose early in the eukaryotic lineage and have been tightly con - served by functional constraints for more than a billion years . Primary sequences re - vealed homology of the Arps to actin and of subunit p40 ( gene name ARPC1 ) to b - propel - ler proteins , but the other four subunits in the complex ( genes named ARPC2 through ARPC5 ) share little sequence homology to known proteins . Homology models of the structures of Arp2 and Arp3 based on the structure of actin suggested that they might form a dimer that would cap the slow - grow - ing pointed end of an actin filament and initiate growth of a new filament in the fast - growing barbed direction ( 19 ) . Both predic - tions were verified ( 4 ) . Electron microscopy ( 4 , 20 , 21 ) and chemical cross - linking ( 20 , 22 ) revealed the overall shape of the complex and subunit nearest neighbors . Our crystal structure of bovine Arp2 / 3 complex at 2 . 0 Å resolution reveals the struc - ture of each subunit as well as their relation - ships . This structure suggests that activation involves a concerted movement of several subunits , allowing Arp2 and Arp3 to form a nucleation site for the growth of a new actin filament . A contact between ARPC1 p40 and Arp3 in an adjacent complex in the crystal is a possible anchor for the complex on the side of an actin filament . Structure determination . Crystals of bovine Arp2 / 3 complex in space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 diffracted to a resolution of 2 . 0 Å ( Table 1 ) . We calculated the electron density map from a multiwavelength anomalous dif - fraction data set collected at three wave - lengths from a crystal with 34 platinum atoms per asymmetric unit . This experimental phase map allowed us to identify all seven subunits and build a preliminary model with 65 % of the 1980 residues . Several rounds of refine - ment against native data followed by rebuild - ing resulted in the present model with 1709 residues and 1881 waters ( R free 5 24 . 9 % ) . Weak electron density indicates that subdo - mains 1 and 2 of Arp2 are highly flexible . We used a model of actin to trace the backbone for this half of Arp2 but did not include it in the refined model . Instead , we show a poly - alanine model of actin for subdomains 1 and 2 of Arp2 to indicate their orientation relative to subdomains 3 and 4 . Overall shape of the Arp2 / 3 complex and arrangement of the seven subunits . The Arp2 / 3 complex is a flat ellipsoid about 150 Å long , 140 Å wide , and 70 to 100 Å thick [ Fig . 1 and Web fig . 1 ( 23 ) ] . A dimer of subunits ARPC2 p34 and ARPC4 p20 ( two shades of blue in the figures ) form a C - shaped clamp that cradles the Arp subunits ( orange and red ) . Extensive interactions with p34 bury 2100 Å 2 of the surface of p20 [ Web table 1 ( 23 ) ] . Contacts with both Arps , ARPC1 p40 , and ARPC5 p16 bury an addi - tional 3300 Å 2 of the surface of p20 . p34 makes extensive contacts ( 3862 Å 2 of sur - face ) with p20 and with Arp3 , which p34 embraces between its NH 2 - terminal a / b 1 do - main and its COOH - terminal helix . The NH 2 - terminal a / b 2 domain of p34 and subunit ARPC1 p40 reinforce the top and bottom of this clamp . Experiments with yeast ( 24 ) had suggested critical roles for p20 and p34 . The flat Arp subunits lie end to end in this clamp , tilted about 40° from the plane defined by p16 , p20 , p34 , and p40 . The Arps are splayed apart slightly , accounting for the cleft ob - served in electron micrographs of shadowed specimens ( 4 , 20 ) . This separation thins one side of the ellipsoid , creating a slight inden - tation featured in reconstructions from cryo - electron micrographs ( 21 ) . Subunits ARPC3 p21 and ARPC5 p16 decorate the edges of the structure . Both p21 and p40 have large basic patches ( Fig . 1C ) . The arrangement of subunits agrees well with extensive chemical cross - linking experiments and with one , but not all , reported two - hybrid interactions ( 22 , 25 ) . Structures of the actin - related pro - teins . Arp3 resembles the actin fold to such a degree that the actin backbone fits reason - ably well into the experimental map , with the exception that the central cleft is spread open about 12° further than actin and lacks a bound nucleotide ( Fig . 2C ) . An extensive network of bound waters replaces the nucleotide in this cleft . Although Arp3 has most of the residues that interact with adenosine triphos - phate ( ATP ) in actin ( 26 ) , the affinity is lower ( 27 ) so that nucleotide is lost during purification and crystallization in buffers without free ATP . Arp3 has 42 more residues than actin , most of which are found in four insertions that extend surface loops and adjacent ele - ments of secondary structure . We refer to four subdomains , as originally defined for Structural Biology Laboratory , Salk Institute for Bio - logical Studies , 10010 North Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Present address : Department of Medical Biochemis - try and Microbiology , Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden . ‡ Present address : Avidis , Biopole Clermont - Limagne , 63 360 Saint Beauzire , France . § Present address : Department of Biochemistry , Dart - mouth College , Hanover , NH 03755 , USA . \ Present address : Department of Molecular , Cellular , and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . ¶ To whom correspondence should be addressed .

The first insert , Gln 46 to Cys 54 , extends a long surface loop , most of which is poorly represented in the electron density map . This loop , corresponding to the deoxyribonuclease ( DNase ) binding loop of actin , is exposed to solvent near the interface of subdomain 2 of Arp3 with p34 . The second insert , Thr 154 to Arg 161 , adds seven residues to the loop between the end of the long helix connecting subdomain 2 to the core b sheet of subdomain 3 . This loop is exposed to solvent on the back side of Arp3 in our standard view . The third insert from sequence alignments , Ser 263 to Phe 267 , is used for the structural insert 260 – 264 that extends two antiparallel b strands at the top of subdomain 4 . The fourth insert , Val 347 to Leu 358 , adds almost two turns to a long a helix 9 and extends the following loop at the lower left corner of subdomain 3 . This longer helix and loop form a principal contact with p21 . The experimental map had strong density for subdomains 3 and 4 of Arp2 , but very little for subdomains 1 and 2 . Density suffi - cient to identify helices and thus orient sub - domains 1 and 2 appeared weakly only after three rounds of refinement . Because this den - sity was too weak to trace the entire chain through both subdomains , we show a poly - alanine backbone model in their place . Subdomains 3 and 4 of Arp2 are similar to actin , sharing all elements of secondary struc - ture . However , the central cleft is open by about 18° compared with actin and lacks a bound nucleotide . Although most of the res - idues of actin that interact with ATP are conserved in Arp2 ( 26 ) , the affinity is low ( 27 ) , so bound ATP was lost during purifi - cation and crystallization . Arp2 has 19 extra residues compared with actin . The only large insert , Tyr 325 – Glu 335 , extends helix 9 and the following loop in the lower left corner of subdomain 3 . This insert is structurally equivalent to the fourth insert of Arp3 . This helix interacts with the NH 2 - terminus of p16 on the back side of our standard view of the complex . Structures of ARPC2 p34 and ARPC4 p20 . ARPC2 p34 and ARPC4 p20 form a dimer at the heart of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The folds of residues 1 to 114 and 115 to 236 of p34 are similar to each other and to the NH 2 - terminal 127 residues of p20 ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . These a / b domains start with a four - turn helix followed by an antiparallel b sheet of five strands , with an a helix inserted be - tween strands 3 and 4 and completed by a short helix . Although similar in structure , structure - based alignments of the sequences of these domains revealed few identical res - idues : p34 a / b 1 and a / b 2 have only seven identical residues , p34 a / b 1 and p20 a / b have 14 identical residues , and p34 a / b 2 and p20 a / b have nine identical residues . A search for proteins with folds similar to these a / b domains yielded no matches . Long COOH - terminal helices of 43 resi - dues ( p34 ) and 38 residues ( p20 ) associate with each other in an antiparallel fashion with a crossing angle of about – 20° . These helices are loosely packed compared with true anti - parallel coiled coils . The interface includes two cavities : the larger one surrounded by p20 156 / 160 and p34 254 / 258 , and the small - er one surrounded by p20 145 and p34 265 / 269 . The interface between the helices is formed by hydrophobic residues and two salt bridges , but these residues are not spaced in a regular heptad repeat or packed in a knob - in - hole fashion ( 28 ) . Structure of ARPC1 p40 . ARPC1 p40 ( Fig . 3E ) is a WD40 b - propeller protein with seven blades each consisting of 42 to 96 residues folded into four b strands . Like G protein b subunits , the NH 2 - terminal strand of the polypeptide completes blade 7 as its D strand before the second strand initiates blade 1 as strand A . Unlike b subunits , the polypep - tide chain starts with this strand rather than with an NH 2 - terminal extension . Blades 1 to 4 have tryptophan in the W position at the distal end of strand A , and blades 5 to 7 have phenylalanine in this position . None of these W positions of p40 is followed by the aspartic acid that gave b propeller their names as “WD repeat” proteins . An insert of 23 resi - dues between strands C and D of blade 4 is exposed to solvent on the lower surface of p40 in our standard orientation . Unlike G protein b subunits , p40 has an insert of 35 residues between blades 6 and 7 . Residues 297 to 309 of this loop are ordered , with residues 297 to 305 forming a short helix that interacts with Arp3 in an adjacent complex related by ( – x , 1 ⁄ 2 1 y , 1 ⁄ 2 – z ) symmetry [ Web fig . 2 ( 23 ) ] . Both connections of this helix to the rest of p40 ( residues 289 to 296 and 310 to 319 ) are disordered . The top faces of all seven blades interact extensively with the NH 2 - terminal a / b domain of p20 . The top of blades 4 and 5 interact with helix 138 – 148 of Fig . 1 .

The bottom face of p40 has an extensive patch of basic residues shown in the electrostatic representation of the molec - ular surface [ Fig . 1C and Web fig . 1 ( 23 ) ] . Structures of ARPC3 p21 and ARPC5 p16 . ARPC3 p21 ( Fig . 3B ) is a bundle of four substantial a helices connected by some long surface loops . Two long NH 2 - terminal loops interrupted by two short antiparallel b strands lead , at residue 52 , to three turns of helix 1 . A short loop of nine residues con - nects to five turns of helix 2 , followed by a short loop and three turns of helix 3 . A surface loop of 22 residues leads to six turns of helix 4 . The final loop of 27 residues includes one turn of a helix . The surface loops form an extensive hydrophobic inter - face with subdomains 3 and 4 of Arp3 bor - dered by salt bridges . A search for proteins with similar folds yielded no matches . ARPC5 p16 ( Fig . 3A ) begins with a par - ticularly long NH 2 - terminal extension that winds around and interacts extensively with p20 , p40 , and Arp2 and ends with a bundle of seven a helices that interacts with p20 and p40 . This NH 2 - terminal extension may sim - ply reinforce the interactions among Arp2 , p40 , and p20 or relay conformational changes between these subunits . p16 protrudes from the plane of the ellipsoid with most of its loops and helices exposed to the solvent . A search for proteins with similar structures yielded no matches . Inactive and active conformations of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Highly purified bovine Arp2 / 3 complex is inactive with respect to actin filament nucleation unless stimulated by WASp / Scar proteins and actin filaments ( 29 ) . Assuming that the Arps form the first two subunits in the new actin filament ( 19 , 21 , 22 ) , the arrangement of the Arps in the puri - fied complex explains why it is inactive . Al - though the Arps lie approximately head to tail like subunits in the long - pitch helix of an actin filament , they are rotated 180° around the filament axis relative to each other ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Thus , the Arps form neither a long - pitch actin helix nor a short - pitch actin helix ( Fig . 4C ) . We propose that ATP binding to the Arps Fig . 2 .

Structure determination and statistics . Arp2 / 3 complex was puri(cid:222)ed from bovine thymus ( 29 ) and concentrated to 5 mg / ml by ion - exchange chromatography in 20 mM tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM dithiothreitol . The protein crystallized in 1 to 3 days at 4¡C by vapor diffusion against 6 % polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 8000 , 0 . 1 M KSCN , and 0 . 1 M Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) . Large crystals obtained by macro seeding were soaked in 18 % PEG 8000 , 20 % glycerol , 0 . 2 M KSCN , and 0 . 1 M Hepes for 1 hour and (cid:223)ash - frozen in liquid N 2 . The Pt derivative was obtained by soaking the crystal in the cryoprotection buffer with 10 mM KPtNO 2 for 24 hours . Diffraction data from frozen crystals ( 100 K ) were measured with a charge - coupled device detector on beamline 9 - 2 , Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory ( Palo Alto , CA ) using oscillations less than 0 . 5¡ to avoid overlaps due to the large cell dimensions . Re(cid:223)ection data were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM and scaled using SCALA ( 36 ) . Initial Pt sites were observed in anomalous Patterson maps , and eight sites were identi(cid:222)ed using SOLVE ( 36 ) . MLPHARE identi(cid:222)ed and re(cid:222)ned 34 Pt sites per asymmetric unit . Phases calculated with MLPHARE were solvent - (cid:223)attened using DM on the basis of a solvent content of 58 % ( one complex per asymmetric unit ) . Electron density maps showed clear elements of secondary structure . An automated search of the maps with actin ( 1ATN ) using FFFEAR did not locate the Arp2 or Arp3 . However , searching with the small ( residues 4 to 145 ) and large ( residues 147 to 334 ) domains separately identi(cid:222)ed the position of Arp3 and the large domain of Arp2 . Upon recognition of the b - propeller structure of p40 , the alanine backbone of the G protein b subunit ( 1GP2 ) was placed into the density as an initial model . Additional secondary structure elements were identi(cid:222)ed and built manually ( 37 ) . The amino acid sequences of the seven bovine subunits came from expressed sequence tag databases . The (cid:222)rst round of re(cid:222)nement included 65 % of the residues . The present model resulted from three more rounds of rebuilding and re(cid:222)nement ( 38 , 39 ) .

Nucleotide binding presumably closes the open clefts of Arp2 and Arp3 . A rotation of about 20° of Arp2 , p20 , p40 , and p16 relative to Arp3 , p34 , and p21 would translate Arp2 ; 3 nm relative to Arp3 , positioning subdo - main 4 of Arp2 next to subdomain 3 of Arp3 exactly like a short - pitch actin dimer . A va - riety of intersubunit or intrasubunit move - ments could achieve this docking of the Arps without producing clashes between the sub - units . Given the stability of the complex ( 20 ) , we view this class of rotations to be more likely than other rearrangements involving subunit dissociation and rebinding , such as rotation of Arp2 180° around its pointed end – barbed end axis to form an Arp dimer similar to a long - pitch helix dimer of an actin fila - ment . Incorporating one Arp into the barbed end of a preexisting filament and the other into a branch ( 20 ) would also require a mas - sive rearrangement of subunits . The proposed compact conformation leaves both the barbed and pointed ends of the Arp dimer relatively exposed , such that the Arp dimer could , in principle , elongate at either end or even fit into the middle of an actin filament . However , incorporating the Arp2 / 3 complex into the middle of a filament would leave no obvious nucleation site for the daughter filament and is inconsistent with both biochemical ( 4 – 6 ) and electron micro - scopic data ( 21 ) . In particular , Arp2 / 3 com - plex binds to and initiates branches from the sides of preformed actin filaments , even if these mother filaments are stabilized by phal - loidin ( 5 , 6 ) . Therefore , we favor the view that Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the side of the mother filament and that the Arps are the first two subunits in the branch ( 21 ) . Nucleation of barbed end growth by Arp2 / 3 complex . Arp2 appears to be unob - structed and suitable for addition of an actin subunit at either its barbed or pointed end . Both ends of Arp3 appear to be generally compatible with polymerization , except for insertions that would interfere at both ends : residues 259 to 265 at the pointed end and residues 347 to 362 at the barbed end . Thus , the barbed end of Arp3 is more obstructed and the pointed end less obstructed than pre - dicted ( 19 ) . Rearrangements of surface loops are like - ly to be required for elongation from either the barbed end or the pointed end of Arp3 . The favored end is not obvious on structural grounds , but filament branches nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex grow in the barbed direction both in vitro ( 4 , 5 , 21 ) and in cells ( 2 , 3 ) . Perhaps the activation process favors rear - rangement of the obstructing surface features at the barbed end relative to the pointed end . Alternatively , faster elongation at the barbed end may simply overwhelm slow growth at the pointed end , particularly in cells where profilin prevents pointed end growth . Activation of Arp2 / 3 complex . We sug - gest that all factors known to promote nucle - ation by Arp2 / 3 complex do so by favoring the same active conformation . The known nucleation - promoting factors are proteins re - lated to WASp [ reviewed in ( 13 ) ] , preexist - ing actin filaments ( 5 , 6 , 29 , 30 ) , and ATP ( 27 ) . WASp and related proteins stimulate nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex , but only after a lag . Filaments eliminate this lag , which suggests that filaments formed during the lag promote nucleation autocatalytically . Ther - modynamic coupling between the binding of WASp and actin filaments to Arp2 / 3 complex ( 14 ) suggests that both ligands favor the same active conformation of Arp2 / 3 com - plex . New evidence suggests that ATP bind - ing and hydrolysis by Arp2 / 3 complex also promotes nucleation ( 27 ) , perhaps by favor - Fig . 3 .

An attractive mechanism is that nucleation - promoting factors stabilize the compact confor - mation by bridging p40 and p21 . The active part of WASp ( and related proteins such as N - WASP and Scar ) consists of three named segments , W , C , and A . The 19 - residue WH2 domain ( W or V for verprolin homology ) binds monomeric actin in much the same way that profilin binds actin ( 11 , 29 ) . A central segment ( C ) of 37 residues contributes to binding both actin and Arp2 / 3 complex ( 14 ) . The COOH - terminal acidic segment ( A ) of 18 residues ( 13 of which are acidic ) binds p21 , as judged from two hybrid interactions ( 15 ) . C and A are re - quired for activation , and N - WASP WCA can be chemically cross - linked to Arp3 , Arp2 , p40 , and p21 ( 31 ) . WH2 does not bind Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( 14 ) but is postulated to contribute to acti - vation by anchoring the first actin subunit in the new filament to Arp2 / 3 complex ( 15 ) . This is expected to be an effective strategy for promot - ing nucleation , because actin trimers are very unstable as a result of rapid dissociation ( 12 ) . Filament branching . Preexisting actin filaments not only form the base for Arp2 / 3 complex to anchor a 70° branch , they also cooperate with WASp / Scar proteins to acti - vate Arp2 / 3 complex . Arp2 / 3 complex has a low affinity for the sides of actin filaments , but binding to filaments enhances the affinity of WCA for Arp2 / 3 complex ( 14 ) . This ther - modynamic coupling is most simply ex - plained by binding of filaments and WCA each favoring the active conformation . Anal - ysis of electron micrographs of frozen - hy - drated branches ( 21 ) shows that Arp2 / 3 com - plex contacts three successive subunits along one long - pitch helix of the mother filament and suggests that the Arps form the first two subunits of the branch . The actin subunits of the mother filament are completely unper - turbed at the branch ( 21 ) . Subunits p34 and p40 are leading candi - dates to anchor the complex to the side of the mother filament . Chemical cross - linking ( 20 , 22 ) and inhibition of branching by an anti - body to p34 ( 32 ) both indicate that p34 con - tacts the mother filament . A structural argu - ment implicates p40 . A helix in the loop between blades 6 and 7 of p40 contacts Arp3 in an adjacent complex [ Web fig . 2A ( 23 ) ] . Helices of gelsolin ( 33 , 34 ) and profilin ( 35 ) contact a similar nonpolar surface between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin [ Web fig . 2B ( 23 ) ] . Anchoring the helix in the p40 loop on a subunit in an actin filament would position the complex on the side of the filament . However , rotation of the entire complex 180° relative to its position in the crystal would be required to orient the barbed end of the branch correctly with respect to the polarity of the mother filament . The disordered loops Fig . 4 .

In ( D ) , Arp2 , p20 , p40 , and p16 were shifted as a rigid body so that Arp2 contacts Arp3 like two subunits of a short - pitch actin (cid:222)lament helix .

Much more work is required to determine how Arp2 / 3 complex is activated and medi - ates filament branching . The crystal structure of Arp2 / 3 complex provides the foundation for detailed analysis of these mechanisms as well as more penetrating studies of actin fil - ament dynamics in cells .

The arrangement of subunits agrees well with the following contacts identi(cid:222)ed by chemical cross - link - ing : Arp3 to p34 , p21 , and p20 ; Arp2 to p40 and p34 ( long linker ) ; p40 to p34 ; and p20 to p16 ( long linker ) . It also agrees with a two - hybrid interaction , p34 to p20 ( 15 ) . 26 . The residues of Arp2 that interact with ATP in actin are highly conserved in Arp2 : actin Asp 154 5 Arp2 Asp 158 , Asp 157 5 Asp 161 , Gly 158 5 Gly 162 , Val 159 5 Val 163 , Lys 213 5 Lys 217 , Glu 214 5 Glu 218 , Gly 301 5 Gly 306 , Thr 302 5 S 307 , Met 304 5 Met 309 , and Tyr 305 5 Tyr 310 . The residues of Arp3 that interact with ATP in actin are also highly conserved : actin Asp 11 5 Arp3 Asp 11 , Ser 14 5 Thr 14 , Gly 15 5 Gly 15 , Leu 16 5 Tyr 16 , Lys 18 5 Lys 18 , Asp 154 5 Asp 169 , Asp 157 5 Asp 172 , Gly 158 5 Gly 173 , Val 159 5 Val 174 , Lys 213 5 Lys 228 , Glu 214 5 Glu 229 , Gly 301 5 Gly 324 , Thr 302 5 Ser 325 , Met 304 5 Met 327 , Tyr 305 5 Phe 328 , and Lys 336 5 Arg 374 . 27 .

The following residues contribute to the interface between the COOH - terminal helices of p34 and p20 : p34 Leu 243 , Phe 247 , Tyr 250 , His 254 , Ser 258 , Tyr 261 / Ile 262 , Phe 273 , Val 276 / Leu 277 ; p20 Phe 134 , His 137 , Met 149 , Ser 152 , Arg 156 , Val 160 , and Phe 164 . Two salt bridges between the helices are p34 Arg 265 —p20 Glu 145 and p34 Lys 296 —p20 Glu 141 . Rather than a 3 - 4 - 3 - 4 - 3 - 4 pattern , the pattern of interface residues is 4 - 3 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 3 - 4 - 4 - 3 in p34 and 3 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 3 - 4 - 4 - 4 in p20 . Two interface residue pairs of p34 ( Tyr 261 / Ile 262 and Val 276 / Leu 277 ) straddle the p20 chain . 29 . H . N . Higgs , L . Blanchoin , T . D . Pollard , Biochemistry 38 , 15212 ( 1999 ) . 30 .

Hartgerink , Elia Beniash , Samuel I . Stupp * We have used the pH - induced self - assembly of a peptide - amphiphile to make a nanostructured (cid:222)brous scaffold reminiscent of extracellular matrix . The de - sign of this peptide - amphiphile allows the nano(cid:222)bers to be reversibly cross - linked to enhance or decrease their structural integrity . After cross - linking , the (cid:222)bers are able to direct mineralization of hydroxyapatite to form a composite material in which the crystallographic c axes of hydroxyapatite are aligned with the long axes of the (cid:222)bers . This alignment is the same as that observed between collagen (cid:222)brils and hydroxyapatite crystals in bone . Self - assembly and biomineralization are used in biology for fabrication of many composite materials . Bone tissue is a particularly com - plex example of such a composite because it contains multiple levels of hierarchical orga - nization ( 1 ) . At the lowest level of this hier - archy is the organization of collagen fibrils with respect to hydroxyapatite ( HA ) crystals . The collagen fibrils are formed by self - as - sembly of collagen triple helices and the HA crystals grow within these fibrils in such a way that their c axes are oriented along the long axes of the fibrils ( 2 ) . The preparation of any material with structure on the nanoscale is a challenging problem . Fabrication of ma - terials that resemble bone , even at the lowest level of hierarchical organization , is even more difficult because it involves two dissim - ilar organic and inorganic nanophases that have a specific spatial relation with respect to one another . One way to accomplish this in an artificial system is to prepare an organic nanophase designed to exert control over crystal nucleation and growth of the inorgan - ic component . The controlled nucleation and growth of crystals from organic templates has been demonstrated by in vitro experiments ( 3 – 8 ) and in a number of natural biomineralizing systems ( 9 – 11 ) . These studies on templated crystal growth suggest that nucleation occurs on surfaces which expose repetitive patterns of anionic groups . These anionic groups tend to concentrate the inorganic cations creating local supersaturation followed by oriented nucleation of the crystal . Many groups have investigated the preparation of bone - like ma - terials with the use of organic substrates such as poly ( lactic acid ) , reconstituted collagen , and many others ( 12 – 18 ) , and some studies show a similar correlation between the crys - Department of Materials Science and Engineering , Department of Chemistry , and Medical School , North - western University , 2225 North Campus Drive , Evan - ston , IL 60208 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .
