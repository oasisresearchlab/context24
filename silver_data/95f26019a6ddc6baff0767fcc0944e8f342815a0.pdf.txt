Retromer complexes ( CSC in yeast ) form coats by interconnecting sorting 23 nexins ( SNX ) . The dynamics of this process is poorly explored . Here , we analyze the 24 oligomerization of CSC / SNX - BAR retromer coats on oriented synthetic lipid tubules . SNX - 25 BARs and CSC assemble a static tubular coat that does not exchange subunits . Coat 26 formation proceeds bidirectionally , adding new subunits at both ends of the coat . High 27 concentrations of SNX - BARs alone suffice to constrict membrane tubes to an invariant 28 radius of 19 nm . At lower concentrations , CSC - complexes must drive constriction , which 29 requires their oligomerization . CSCs populate the SNX - BAR layer at densities that 30 increase with the starting radius of the membrane tube . We hence propose that retromer - 31 mediated crosslinking of SNX - BARs at variable densities tunes the coat according to the 32 energy required to deform the membrane . This model is supported by the effects of 33 mutations interfering with retromer oligomerization , which impair retromer function in yeast 34 and human cells . 35 36 37 38 39 2 40 Introduction 41 42 Endosomes and lysosomes form a complex network of interconnected organelles of 43 different composition and function . They exchange proteins through fusion and fission with 44 each other and , in a more selective fashion , through endosomal transport carriers ( ETCs ) . 45 ETCs are tubulo - vesicular structures bulging from the limiting membrane of these 46 organelles . The formation of ETCs comprises several steps : Cargo selection , membrane 47 deformation , and detachment from the donor organelle through membrane fission . 48 Alternatively , cargo can also pass between endo - lysosomal compartments through kiss - 49 and - run , a transient fusion between two endo - lysosomal organelles followed by immediate 50 re - fission ( Solinger et al , 2020 ; Luzio et al , 2014 ) . ETCs form through a variety protein 51 coats and their interaction partners , such as the retromer , retriever and CCC complexes , 52 ESCPE - 1 , sorting nexins and the WASH complex ( Chen et al , 2019 ; Derivery et al , 2009 ; 53 Gomez & Billadeau , 2009 ; Phillips - Krawczak et al , 2015 ; Rojas et al , 2007 ; Temkin et al , 54 2011 ; Lucas et al , 2016 ; Simonetti et al , 2022 , 2019 ) . 55 56 Retromer is a conserved tubular protein coat , which was originally defined in yeast as a 57 stable complex that dissociates into two parts : The SNX complex , consisting of the SNX - 58 BAR sorting nexins Vps5 and Vps17 , and the peripheral CSC complex ( Vps26 , Vps29 and 59 Vps35 ) ( Seaman et al , 1998 ) . In non - yeast systems , the Vps26 / 29 / 35 complex alone is 60 referred to as retromer . It is recruited to membranes through various sorting nexins . Some 61 of them carry BAR domains , such as the SNX - BARs Vps5 and Vps17 , others do not , such 62 as Snx3 / Grd19 ( Harrison et al , 2014 ; Deatherage et al , 2020 ; Strochlic et al , 2007 ; 63 Harterink et al , 2011 ) . The SNX complex ( Vps5 / Vps17 ) binds membranes via PX domains , 64 which recognize phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) ( Burda et al , 2002 ) , and through 65 BAR domains , which bind highly curved membranes . The SNX complex recruits CSC , 66 which by itself shows only weak affinity for the membrane , although it can interact with the 67 bilayer when bound to other sorting nexins , such as Snx3 ( Lucas et al , 2016 ; 68 Purushothaman & Ungermann , 2018 ; Leneva et al , 2021 ; Strochlic et al , 2007 ; 69 Deatherage et al , 2020 ) . Retromer associates with numerous other factors , which are 70 important for the formation of the transport carriers and / or their fission from the membrane . 71 These include components of the Rab - GTPase system ( Seaman et al , 2009 ; Rojas et al , 72 2008 ; Jia et al , 2016 ; Balderhaar et al , 2010 ; Liu et al , 2012 ; Purushothaman & 73 3 Ungermann , 2018 ) , the actin - regulating WASH complex ( Harbour et al , 2012 ; Chen et al , 74 2019 ; Derivery et al , 2009 ; Jia et al , 2012 ; Gomez & Billadeau , 2009 ; Phillips - Krawczak et 75 al , 2015 ; Temkin et al , 2011 ; Lucas et al , 2016 ) , or EHD1 , an ATPase that has structural 76 similarities to dynamins ( Daumke et al , 2007 ; Gokool et al , 2007 ) . 77 78 Structural studies of sorting nexins and retromer begin to elucidate how these coats wrap 79 around membranes and how they recruit cargo ( Leneva et al , 2021 ; Kovtun et al , 2018 ; 80 Hierro et al , 2007 ; Lucas et al , 2016 ; Kendall et al , 2020 ; Collins et al , 2005 , 2008 ; 81 Purushothaman et al , 2017 ; Zhang et al , 2021 ) . A further mechanistic analysis of the 82 formation of ETCs and their fission from endo - lysosomal compartments will , however , 83 require complementing dynamic data from in vitro systems that reproduce the formation 84 and fission of ETCs in a well - defined , tunable and optically well - resolved setting . Attempts 85 in this direction have already been undertaken . Retromer coat produces tubules on giant 86 unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) ( Purushothaman & Ungermann , 2018 ; Purushothaman et al , 87 2017 ) . Those are hard to quantify because the tubules are numerous and difficult to 88 resolve by light microscopy . Retromer oligomerization could also be followed on supported 89 planar lipid bilayers ( Deatherage et al , 2020 ) , where protein interactions can be studied 90 extremely well . But such a system appears less apt for observing tubulation by the coat 91 and fission . 92 93 We engaged in an in vitro characterization of retromer because our studies on membrane 94 fission on yeast vacuoles and mammalian endosomes revealed the PROPPINs Atg18 and 95 WIPI1 , respectively , as crucial factors ( Zieger & Mayer , 2012 ; Peters et al , 2004 ; 96 Gopaldass et al , 2017 ; DeLeo et al , 2021 ) . Atg18 integrates with CSC to form the CROP 97 complex ( Courtellemont et al , 2022 ; Marquardt et al , 2022 ) displays much more potent 98 membrane fission activity than the PROPPIN alone . To generate a system that may allow 99 to analyse the mechanistic relationship of CROP to retromer , we used oriented lipid 100 tubules on glass supports ( Dar et al , 2015 ) . The tubules allow to quantitatively follow the 101 formation of the coat on them , a property which we exploited for an analysis of the 102 properties and dynamics of retromer . 103 104 Results 105 106 4 Supported membrane tubes ( SMTs ) ( Dar et al , 2015 ) are individually observable tubular 107 membranes that are immobilized and amenable to quantitative optical analysis . SMTs can 108 be generated by liquid flow through a microfluidic chamber carrying lipid spots on its glass 109 bottom . The flow produces arrays of parallel membrane tubes , which probably become 110 stabilized in this orientation by occasional contacts with non - coated spots of the glass 111 surface . Such SMTs allow to image the behaviour of proteins on the tubes over extended 112 periods of time . The tube diameters can be quantified via a low percentage of incorporated 113 fluorescent lipidic tracers because the fluorescence per unit tube length will depend on the 114 number of fluorescent lipids in that unit , and hence upon the radius of the tube . 115 116 CSC and SNX - BARs cooperate to constrict pre - formed membrane tubules to a 117 uniform radius 118 119 We adapted this system to study the formation of retromer coats . To visualize SNX / CSC 120 coat formation , an SMT array was formed on a coverslip that was covalently coated with 121 polyethylene glycol and mounted in a flow chamber . The SMTs were labelled through 1 122 mol % of Texas Red DHPE and contained 5 % PI3P , because this phosphoinositide is 123 required to recruit SNX - BARs onto membranes ( Yu & Lemmon , 2001 ; Cheever et al , 2001 ; 124 Song et al , 2001 ) . Upon addition of purified recombinant SNX complex ( Vps5 and Vps17 ) 125 and mClover - tagged CSC ( Vps26 , Vps35 , Vps29 mClover ) ( Suppl . Fig . 1a , b ) , uniform 126 membrane binding could be observed by spinning disc fluorescence microscopy within 127 seconds ( Fig . 1a , movie 1 ) . PI3P and SNX were necessary to recruit CSC to the tubes 128 ( Suppl . Fig . 2a ) . About one minute after addition of SNX and CSC mClover , the mClover - 129 signal strongly accumulated at multiple discrete sites on a tubule , suggesting that CSC 130 was concentrating into separate protein domains ( Fig . 1a , movie 1 ) . The domains 131 elongated over time , as visualized by kymograph analysis ( Fig 1b ) . Co - labelling of CSC 132 and SNX with mRuby and GFP , respectively , revealed that the zones where both CSC mRuby 133 and SNX GFP were concentrated mirrored precisely zones of decreased lipid fluorescence , 134 which were visualized through the red - fluorescing lipid Cy5 . 5 - PE ( Fig . 1c and d ) . The 135 concentrations necessary for domain - formation by SNX complex and CSC varied from one 136 preparation to another by a factor of two to three and were in general in the range of 10 - 25 137 nM . At such low concentrations , domains did not form in the absence of CSC ( Fig . 1e ) . 138 Domains could also be formed by SNX alone ( Fig . 1f , g and h , movie 2 ) . However , for a 139 given preparation this always required SNX concentrations 5 - 10 times above those that 140 sufficed to generate domains in the presence of CSC . 141 5 142 The protein - enriched domains showed a strong reduction in lipid fluorescence , suggesting 143 that the diameter of the underlying lipid bilayer was severely reduced ( Fig . 1a - c , Suppl . 144 Fig . 2b , c ) . The decrease in fluorescence was not due to a change in the direct 145 environment of the fluorescent lipid upon protein binding ( Jung et al , 2009 ; Hsieh et al , 146 2012 ) , as we could observe the same effect using alternative lipid probes , which carry the 147 fluorophore either on the membrane surface ( Texas Red DHPE , Cy5 . 5 - PE ) or inside the 148 hydrophobic part of the bilayer ( NBD - PC ) ( Suppl . Fig . 2b ; Fig . 1c , d ) . Therefore , we 149 attribute the decrease in lipid fluorescence to a reduction in the amount of lipid underneath 150 the protein domain , i . e . , to a reduction in the radius of the membrane tube . 151 152 The radius of the membrane tubes in the constricted domains could be estimated using 153 dynamin as a reference . Dynamin constricts membrane tubes to a defined radius of 11 . 2 154 nm ( Roux et al , 2010 ) . The lipid fluorescence in the SMTs can thus be calibrated and their 155 radius can be deduced ( Dar et al , 2015 ) ( see Material and Methods and Supplementary 156 Fig . 3 for details ) . This method revealed that the radius of membrane tubes underneath 157 domains formed by CSC / SNX was 19 . 1 + / - 0 . 6 nm ( Fig . 2 a - d ) , and that this radius was 158 the same for membrane tubes constricted by high concentrations of SNX alone . Domains 159 formed by SNX alone remained competent to bind CSC mClover in a second incubation 160 phase ( Fig . 2e - f ) . However , the recruitment of CSC mClover had no effect on lipid 161 fluorescence under the pre - formed domains ( Fig . 2g ) , suggesting that the tubes 162 maintained their radius . This invariant radius was independent of the initial radius of the 163 non - constricted tube , both for SNX / CSC mClover and for SNX - only domains ( Fig . 2d ) . Thus , 164 in agreement with structural studies ( Kovtun et al , 2018 ; Leneva et al , 2021 ; Zhang et al , 165 2021 ; Kendall et al , 2020 ; Hierro et al , 2007 ; Lucas et al , 2016 ; Purushothaman et al , 166 2017 ) , both CSC and SNX contribute to a constriction of the membrane tubes , probably by 167 forming the retromer coat . SNX alone has membrane scaffolding activity , which defines the 168 diameter of the coat independently of CSC , but CSC allows coat formation at lower SNX 169 concentrations . 170 171 Retromer coats grow rapidly and bidirectionally 172 173 Cryo - EM analyses of retromer uncovered that the interface between the two Vps35 174 subunits of a retromer arch was asymmetric and that these subunits differed in overall 175 6 structure ( Leneva et al , 2021 ) . It was proposed that this asymmetry might render coat 176 assembly directional . Since the SMTs allow to observe coat growth in real time , we tested 177 this hypothesis . To this end we first generated small red - fluorescing constricted coats 178 using SNX and CSC mRuby complexes . After a brief wash with protein - free buffer , SNX and 179 CSC mClover complexes were added ( Fig . 3a to c ) . The green - fluorescing CSC mClover 180 extended the pre - existing red - fluorescing constricted zones that had been formed by 181 CSC mRuby . The extension speed of the coat was substantial , ranging from 1 µm / min to 1 . 5 182 µm / min . This is in a similar range as the speed of dynamin polymerization ( Roux et al , 183 2010 ) . The elongation speed of this coat can also be put into perspective by comparison to 184 the speeds of polymerization of actin tails ( up to 3 . 6 µm / min ; ( Cameron et al , 1999 ) ) , or 185 microtubules ( 10 µm / sec ; ( Gierke et al , 2010 ) ) . Based on the proposed structure of the 186 retromer coat ( Leneva et al , 2021 ; Kovtun et al , 2018 ) we estimate the observed extension 187 speed to require the addition of approximately 10 to 15 SNX dimers per second at each 188 end . CSC mClover / SNX elongated the pre - existing red - fluorescing coats at both ends with 189 similar rates ( Fig . 3b and c ) . Thus , despite the asymmetry in the arches ( Leneva et al , 190 2021 ) , the retromer coat displayed no inherent directionality of growth . 191 192 The retromer coat is a static structure that does not exchange subunits 193 Structural studies of retromer - coated tubules formed with Vps5 revealed that these 194 retromer coats are irregular in terms of their coverage with protein and that CSC 195 oligomerizes into arch - like structures on the sorting nexins ( Leneva et al , 2021 ; Kovtun et 196 al , 2018 ) . The irregularity raises several questions : Does the tubular coat represent a static 197 structure , or is it rather dynamic , with subunits readily moving in and out ? Does CSC 198 facilitate SNX coat formation by dimerization and does the apparent variability in the 199 occupancy of the SNX layer by CSC have functional implications ? 200 201 The formation of a static structure by SNX / CSC implies that the proteins form a rigid coat 202 that might stabilize the underlying membrane tubule . To test this , we used an assay where 203 a membrane tubule is pulled out of a giant unilamellar vesicle ( GUV ) by means of an 204 optical trap . Through analysing the displacement of the bead in the trap , such a setup 205 allows direct measurement of the force required to generate and maintain the tubule ( Roux 206 et al , 2010 ) . Shortly after SNX / CSC mClover addition , protein bound the pulled tubule ( Fig . 207 4a ) . As a consequence , the pulling force exerted on the bead decreased sharply ( Fig 4b ) . 208 Elongating this tubule by displacing the GUV transiently increased in the force again ( Fig . 209 7 4c and d ) , but as the SNX / CSC mClover coat grew along the newly extracted portion of the 210 tubule ( Fig . 4e ) , the force decreased again . This could be repeated several times ( Fig . 4d ) . 211 Together , these data suggest that the SNX / CSC coat forms a rigid scaffold that suffices to 212 stabilizes a membrane tubule . 213 214 CSC density may define the work that the coat performs in deforming membranes 215 216 Binding of CSC adds further interactions to the SNX layer ( Kovtun et al , 2018 ; Leneva et 217 al , 2021 ; Lucas et al , 2016 ) , and could hence provide additional energy for membrane 218 scaffolding . This led us to test whether coat stoichiometry might vary as a function of the 219 radius of the starting tubule , because constricting a less curved membrane requires more 220 work ( Roux , 2013 ) . We first assayed whether the coats are saturated , using SNX and CSC 221 separately in a two - stage experiment . Constricted coats on SMTs were pre - formed from 222 red - fluorescing SNX / CSC mRuby complexes . Non - bound proteins were washed away and , in 223 a second incubation , we added either green - fluorescing SNX GFP or CSC mClover ( Fig . 5 a , b ) . 224 SNX GFP was recruited to the non - constricted areas of the tubes but could not integrate into 225 the constricted domains , suggesting that the membrane in these domains was fully 226 covered . By contrast , CSC mClover bound mainly to the constricted domains . CSC mClover was 227 not recruited in exchange for pre - bound CSC mRuby , which might have dissociated from the 228 constriction , because the CSC mRuby signal in the constricted domains remained constant 229 after the addition of CSC mClover ( Fig . 5c ) . This suggests that the constricted domains are 230 saturated for SNX complexes but retain free binding sites for additional CSC . 231 232 To test whether the density of CSC on retromer coats has functional significance , we 233 compared the density of CSC in constricted coats that had had been formed on membrane 234 tubes of different starting radius . The SMT system is very apt for this analysis because it 235 simultaneously generates many tubes of variable radii on the same slide . Calibration via 236 the integrated fluorescent lipids showed that these " naked tube " radii varied mostly from 237 20 - 40 nm under the conditions we employed . We measured the radius of non - constricted 238 regions to approximate the starting radius of the tube and then measured the signals of 239 SNX GFP and CSC mClover in the constricted domains of that tube ( Suppl . Fig . 3 ) . Whereas 240 CSC mClover fluorescence per unit length of constricted tube increased as a function of 241 starting tube radius ( Fig . 5d , e ) , the density of SNX GFP in the constricted domains was 242 independent of the starting tube radius ( Fig . 5f , g ) . Thus , the larger the starting tube , the 243 8 more CSC is incorporated into the constricted coat . Since the energy required to constrict 244 a membrane tube to a defined diameter increases with its initial radius , this suggests that 245 the work that the SNX coat performs to constrict the membrane may be tuned through the 246 density of CSC complexes that are incorporated to connect them . 247 248 Retromer oligomerization supports coat constriction 249 250 CSC arches can connect multiple SNX subunits and can form oligomers ( Deatherage et al , 251 2020 ; Kendall et al , 2020 ; Kovtun et al , 2018 ; Lucas et al , 2016 ) . Oligomerization might 252 provide additional bonds for membrane deformation by the coat and / or facilitate coat 253 assembly by constraining the subunits in an orientation relative to each other that is best 254 compatible with a constricted lipid tube . In both cases , the capacity of CSC to oligomerize 255 should play an important role for driving the formation of constricted domains . Structural 256 studies showed that CSC forms dimers through a conserved interface on Vps35 ( Kendall 257 et al , 2020 ; Leneva et al , 2021 ) . To assess the contribution of retromer dimerization on 258 coat formation we used the PDB - PISA software ( https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pdbe / pisa / ) to 259 model the Vps35 - Vps35 dimerization interface , using a retromer CryoEM structure ( Kovtun 260 et al , 2018 ; Leneva et al , 2021 ) as an input . PDB - PISA calculates the energy contribution 261 of each residue to a protein - protein interaction surface . This approach predicts residues to 262 form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges between the two Vps35 subunits . We selected the 263 conserved Vps35 residues D671 , L722 and R775 for substitution by alanine , yielding the 264 vps35 PISA allele ( Fig . 6a , b ) . We also generated vps35 AAA3KE , in which another set of 265 conserved residues in the interaction region are substituted . The AAA3KE substitutions 266 abolish the capacity of mammalian VPS35 to self - associate and lead to partial secretion of 267 the vacuolar protease CPY in yeast ( Kendall et al , 2020 ) . A recent structural study showed 268 that all these substituted residues contribute to an asymmetric Vps35 - Vps35 interface 269 ( Leneva et al , 2021 ) . We extracted CSC complexes containing both Vps35 variants from 270 yeast ( Fig . 6c ) and tested their capacity to form higher order oligomers by blue native gel 271 electrophoresis ( Fig . 6d ) . CSC wt migrated in three main bands at apparent molecular 272 masses compatible with a Vps29 mClover - containing monomer of CSC ( 207 kDa ) , a dimer 273 ( 414 kDa ) , and a tetramer ( 828 kDa ) . The most slowly migrating species was abolished in 274 CSC from vps35 AAA3KE cells and weaker in CSC from vps35 PISA , while the intermediate - 275 sized forms persisted . This suggests that the slowest form represents a CSC tetramer held 276 9 together by Vps35 dimerization , whereas the dimer may persist through a Vps26 - Vps26 277 interface ( Kovtun et al , 2018 ) . 278 279 We performed SMT assays to assess the capacity of both CSC variants to form 280 constricted domains . To avoid potential influences of the CSC variants on the speed or 281 extent of SNX recruitment to the tubes , the experiments were performed in two phases . A 282 first incubation at low SNX concentration ( 25 nM ) allowed this complex to bind the tubes 283 without forming constricted domains ( Fig . 7a , b ) . Unbound SNX was washed away before 284 CSC mClover variants were added for the second incubation phase . CSC mClover with 285 vps35 AAA3KE and vps35 PISA was recruited to the prebound SNX with similar kinetics and to 286 similar extent as the wildtype complex ( Fig . 7b - d ) . However , only wildtype CSC drove the 287 formation of constricted domains ( Fig . 7 b , c ) . The CSC variants also failed to drive 288 constriction when they were co - incubated with SNX right from the beginning in a one - 289 phase experiment ( Suppl . Fig . 4a - d ) . That the CSC variants were in principle able to bind a 290 constricted SNX layer was shown by a further experiment , in which constricted SNX - only 291 coats were pre - formed in a first incubation phase at high SNX concentration . CSC AAA3KE - 292 mClover and CSC PISA - mClover bound to those preformed constrictions similarly as the wildtype 293 complex ( Suppl . Fig . 4 e , f ) . Together , these results suggest that higher order self - 294 assembly of CSC via the conserved Vps35 interface is necessary to drive membrane 295 constriction by the SNX / CSC coat . 296 297 Mutations affecting retromer oligomerization impair cargo sorting in vivo 298 299 We used vps35 AAA3KE and vps35 PISA to test the relevance of CSC oligomerization in vivo . 300 To this end , VPS35 was TAP - tagged and corresponding nucleotide exchanges were made 301 at the VPS35 genomic locus , making the mutated alleles the sole source of Vps35 protein . 302 Both vps35 AAA3KE and vps35 PISA were expressed at similar levels as a VPS35 WT allele . 303 ( Suppl . Fig . 5a ) . They supported normal localization and abundance of yomCherry fusions 304 of the CSC subunit Vps29 and the SNX subunit Vps17 , suggesting that they are folded 305 ( Suppl . Fig . 5b and c ) . In contrast to an earlier study , which used secretion of the vacuolar 306 protease CPY as an indirect assay and found only a very mild impact of vps35 AAA3KE 307 ( Kendall et al , 2020 ) , we assessed retromer function through microscopic localization of a 308 yEGFP fusion of Vps10 . Vps10 is a cargo receptor that uses retromer for returning from 309 the pre - vacuolar compartment ( the equivalent of a late endosome ) to the trans - Golgi 310 10 network ( TGN ) ( Marcusson et al , 1994 ) . Cells expressing wildtype VPS35 showed 311 Vps10 yEGFP mostly in small dots scattered in the cytosol or adjacent to the vacuole ( Fig . 312 8a ) , consistent with its expected location in the TGN and pre - vacuolar compartment ( Chi et 313 al , 2014 ) . By contrast , cells lacking VPS35 ( vps35 D ) accumulated significant amounts of 314 Vps10 yEGFP on the vacuolar membrane , where they co - localized with the lipidic vacuole 315 stain FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 8a , b ) . This vacuolar localization is a hallmark of defective retromer 316 function in yeast . It results from the failure to recycle Vps10 from the pre - vacuolar 317 compartment before it finally fuses with the vacuole . The vps35 AAA3KE and vps35 PISA alleles 318 produced an intermediate phenotype , where vacuoles were significantly more labelled by 319 Vps10 yEGFP than in wildtype , but less than in vps35 D ( Fig . 8 a and b ) . The pre - vacuolar 320 compartment recruits SNX and CSC ( Burda et al , 2002 ; Liu et al , 2012 ) . In line with this , 321 Vps17 yomCherry or Vps29 yomCherry appeared as scattered dots when visualized by 322 fluorescence microscopy ( Suppl . Fig . 5b , c ) . We quantified the number of Vps10 yEGFP dots 323 that were also Vps17 yomCherry positive . While 50 % of Vps10 yEGFP positive dots in wildtype 324 cells co - localized with Vps17 yomCherry , 80 - 90 % of colocalization was observed in cells 325 expressing vps35 AAA3KE or vps35 PISA ( Suppl . Fig . 5d ) . This is consistent with Vps10 being 326 collected into SNX - containing structures but unable to recycle back to the Golgi . 327 Correlative light and electron microscopy of the Vps10 yEGFP dots in vps35 PISA cells showed 328 that the structures accumulating Vps17 were indeed PVCs , because they carried multiple 329 lumenal vesicles , which is characteristic for these compartments ( Fig . 8c ) . 330 331 As a readout for retromer function in human cells , we used the glucose transporter 332 GLUT1 , a well - characterized retromer cargo ( Liu et al , 2012 ; Steinberg et al , 2013 ; 333 Hesketh et al , 2014 ; Kvainickas et al , 2017 ; Evans et al , 2020 ) . GLUT1 is normally 334 localized at the plasma membrane and this localization requires its retromer - dependent 335 export from endosomes . Knock - down of hVPS35 in HK2 cells resulted in a strong 336 reduction of GLUT1 on the plasma membrane , consistent with a lack of its retromer - 337 dependent recycling ( Fig . 9a ) . Expression of an si - RNA resistant form of hVPS35 rescued 338 this phenotype , while expression of the corresponding mammalian mutant alleles 339 hVPS35 AAA3KE and hVPS35 PISA did not ( Fig . 9b , c ) . Expressing the AAAKE and PISA 340 variants in wildtype cells led to a similar GLUT1 recycling phenotype as in the knock - down 341 cells , while expression of the wildtype protein did not ( Suppl . Fig . 6 ) . This dominant 342 negative effect suggests that the mutant proteins are correctly folded such that they can 343 compete with the endogenous wt version for retromer complex formation . Another striking 344 11 phenotype of cells lacking hVPS35 is an increase in the size of lysosomal compartments , 345 probably due to a lack of membrane recycling and / or accumulation of undigested material 346 resulting from insufficient delivery of lysosomal enzymes ( Cui et al , 2018 ) . hVps35 knock - 347 down cells showed bigger LAMP1 - positive lysosomal compartments ( Suppl . Fig . 7a ) . 348 These enlarged compartments could be brought back to normal size by expressing an 349 siRNA resistant form of hVPS35 , while expression of hVPS35 PISA and hVPS35 AAA3KE failed 350 to rescue this phenotype ( Suppl . Fig . 7b ) . Altogether , these data suggest a conserved role 351 for Vps35 oligomerization in both yeast and human cells . 352 353 354 Discussion 355 356 Structural analyses have revealed many important features of retromer coats ( Hierro et al , 357 2007 ; Lucas et al , 2016 ; Kendall et al , 2020 ; Collins et al , 2005 , 2008 ; Zhang et al , 2021 ; 358 Purushothaman et al , 2017 ) . Both Snx3 - and Vps5 - based coats show CSC forming arch - 359 like structures that interconnect the sorting nexins over more than 20 nm and angular 360 sections of around 60°C ( Leneva et al , 2021 ; Kovtun et al , 2018 ) . These models show 361 limited regularity of the coat , both with respect to the placement of sorting nexins and their 362 coverage with CSC ( Leneva et al , 2021 ; Kovtun et al , 2018 ) . This irregularity was 363 suggested to represent potential plasticity that may , for example , allow the coat to adjust to 364 different membrane curvatures or to integrate other proteins . Dynamic aspects of coat 365 assembly have , however , not yet been experimentally tested . Our analyses of retromer 366 coat formation in real time provide complementing functional information that relates to 367 several features of the structural models . In our experiments with supported membrane 368 tubes , SNX / CSC assembled into a coat that constricted membranes of variable starting 369 curvature to an invariant radius of 19 nm . This number , obtained with a coat including 370 Vps5 and Vps17 , is in the range of the radius of 15 nm that was obtained in a structural 371 study of a CSC coat formed with Vps5 alone ( Kovtun et al , 2018 ) and similar to the radius 372 of tubules formed by mammalian Vps5 homologs ( Weering et al , 2012 ) . Thus , even though 373 both yeast SNX - BAR proteins , Vps5 and Vps17 , are required for retromer function 374 ( Horazdovsky et al , 1997 ; Seaman & Williams , 2002 ) , absence of one of them does not 375 have a major impact on the dimensions of the membrane tubules shaped by retromer . 376 377 12 The coat formed by SNX / CSC appears as a stable and static scaffold as no exchange 378 between subunits was observed when preformed coats were incubated with an excess of 379 either SNXs or CSC . . Rigidity of the coat is illustrated by its ability to stabilize membrane 380 tubules pulled out of a GUV . Similar experiments allowed to calculate the polymerization 381 energy of dynamin by plotting membrane tension against the residual force exerted by the 382 membrane tubule carrying the polymerized coat ( Roux et al , 2010 ) . We measured no 383 significant residual force on SNX / CSC tubules in the range of membrane tension tested . 384 This suggests a high polymerization energy of the retromer coat which , however , cannot 385 be quantified through this assay at this point . Determining it will require much more work 386 and is beyond the scope of this paper . 387 388 In situ , the stability of the coat and its stabilizing effect on the underlying tubule could be 389 relevant in various ways . It might influence endosomal maturation , where efficient 390 intralumenal vesicle formation by the ESCRT complex requires low endosomal membrane 391 tension . Stabilization of membrane tubules through retromer might maintain the 392 endosomal membrane under high tension , which might then suppress MVB formation as 393 long as sufficient amounts of recycling cargo are present in the endosome . Stability of the 394 retromer coat could also be relevant for the final detachment of a coated carrier : It may 395 impose constraints on lipid flow beneath the coat and thereby promote friction - mediated 396 membrane fission ( Simunovic et al , 2017 ) , when forces pull the tip of the membrane 397 tubule . Such forces might be generated and transmitted through retromer - interacting 398 proteins . In mammalian cells , the CSC interacts with the WASH complex , an activator of 399 Arp2 / 3 that generates branched actin filaments . It was proposed that actin polymerization 400 generates force to elongate the retromer coated tubule and ultimately cause its fission 401 ( Derivery et al , 2009 ; Gomez & Billadeau , 2009 ; Harbour et al , 2012 ; Phillips - Krawczak et 402 al , 2015 ; Temkin et al , 2011 ; Jia et al , 2012 ) . This force would be most efficiently 403 transferred to the growing tubule through a retromer scaffold that is static and stable , 404 which would be in line with our experimental observations . A caveat for this working model 405 is that WASH does not exist in yeast - although also in this organism force produced by 406 actin is harnessed to drive membrane trafficking processes , such as endocytosis ( Goode 407 et al , 2015 ; Kaksonen , 2008 ) . One would hence have to postulate that in this system force 408 is transmitted independently of WASH . 409 410 13 The coat radius of 19 nm can be defined by SNX alone , but CSC facilitates membrane 411 constriction at lower SNX concentration . In the constricted zones , the density of 412 occupation of SNX by CSC varies as a function of the starting diameter of the non - 413 constricted membrane tube . This suggests that constriction of less curved membranes 414 engages more CSC , resulting in a SNX coat with a higher degree of CSC - mediated 415 crosslinking between the SNX subunits . The energy provided by these additional bonds 416 and enhanced scaffolding of SNX by CSC may be two factors that enhance the capacity of 417 the coat to work on the membrane . Then , the coat need not operate at a fixed 418 stoichiometry and retromer density but can be tuned according to the circumstances . This 419 could become relevant when coats must be formed on an endosome with higher 420 membrane tension . Tubulation requires more work under these circumstances , which 421 could be provided by forming a coat with higher CSC content . Elevated CSC density 422 should also offer more binding sites for WASH and might thereby enhance force 423 transmission by actin on the growing tubule . Regulating the concentration of active CSC 424 could thereby allow the cell to tune the rate of retromer - mediated membrane exit from 425 endosomes as a function of endosomal membrane tension . 426 427 CSC incorporation into the coat may provide additional force for tubule formation . That this 428 contribution depends on CSC oligomerization is underscored by the effect of substitutions 429 in the conserved Vps35 - Vps35 interface , which compromise oligomerization ( Kendall et al , 430 2020 ; Leneva et al , 2021 ) . They abolish the capacity of CSC to drive membrane 431 constriction , lead to miss - sorting of the retromer - dependent cargo receptor Vps10 in yeast , 432 and , probably therefore , to the observed partial secretion of the vacuolar peptidase CPY 433 ( Kendall et al , 2020 ) . We did not test the ability of human hVPS35 AAA3KE or hVPS35 PISA to 434 form a stable coat in vitro , but these variants induced a strong and even dominant negative 435 recycling defect of the retromer cargo GLUT1 in living cells . This points to a conserved role 436 of Vps35 - mediated retromer oligomerization in protein recycling from endosomes . 437 438 The asymmetry of the Vps35 - Vps35 interface was proposed to have potential functional 439 consequences , such as for binding cofactors to the arch in a 1 : 2 stoichiometry and / or 440 conferring directionality to the growth of the coat ( Leneva et al , 2021 ) . In our experiments , 441 the coat grew bidirectionally , suggesting that it lacks an inherent preference for adding new 442 subunits at one end . It remains possible , however , that directionality of coat growth can be 443 conferred by additional factors that have not been present in our in vitro system . Structural 444 14 asymmetry might also be exploited for other purposes , for example for binding cargo such 445 as Vps10 , which was proposed to bind to the C - terminal part of Vps35 ( Nothwehr et al , 446 1999 ) and promotes the tubulation activity of SNX / CSC coats ( Purushothaman & 447 Ungermann , 2018 ) . Cargo exerting control over tubule formation through CSC recruitment 448 might then ensure that the recycling machinery is activated when needed . 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 15 Material and methods 456 457 Materials 458 The following lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( USA ) : Egg L - alpha - 459 phosphatidylcholine ( EPC ) ; 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine sodium salt 460 ( DOPS ) ; 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - ( 1 ' - myo - inositol - 3 ' - phosphate ) ( PI3P ) ; 1 , 2 - 461 dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( Cyanine 5 . 5 ) ( Cy5 . 5 PE ) ; 1 - Oleoyl - 2 - [ 12 - 462 [ ( 7 - nitro - 2 - 1 , 3 - benzoxadiazol - 4 - yl ) amino ] dodecanoyl ] - sn - Glycero - 3 - Phosphocholine ( NBD - 463 PC ) . All lipids were dissolved in chloroform . Phosphatidylinositol phosphates were 464 dissolved in chloroform / methanol / water ( 20 : 10 : 1 ) . Texas red DHPE ( Thermofisher cat . 465 T1395MP ) was purchased as a mixed isomer . The para isomer was separated by thin 466 layer chromatography as previously described ( Dar et al , 2015 ) . 467 468 Cell culture , strains and plasmids 469 Yeast cells BY4742 were grown at 30°C in YPD ( 2 % peptone , 1 % yeast extract , 2 % b - D - 470 glucose ) . Genes were deleted by replacing a complete open reading frame with a marker 471 cassette ( Janke et al , 2004 ; Güldener et al , 1996 ) ( see Appendix Table S1 for a list of 472 strains used in this study and Appendix Table S2 for a list of PCR primers used in this 473 study ) . Gene tagging was done as described ( Sheff & Thorn , 2004 ) . Strains used for 474 expression and purification of the retromer complex have been previously described 475 ( Appendix Table 1 ) . VPS35 with genomic mutations at the C - terminus were amplified by 476 PCR from a synthetic gene corresponding to the last 1000 bp of VPS35 for the PISA 477 mutant , or from the pRS315 - Vps35AAA3KE plasmid ( Kendall et al , 2020 ) for the AAA3KE 478 mutant . These fragments were then fused to a LEU2 cassette by fusion PCR and 479 transformed into yeast cells ( Janke et al , 2004 ) 480 481 Live microscopy 482 Vacuoles were stained with FM4 - 64 essentially as described ( Desfougères et al , 2016 ) . An 483 overnight preculture in HC ( Hartwell ' s complete ) medium was used to inoculate a 10 ml 484 culture . Cells were then grown in HC to an OD 600 between 0 . 6 and 1 . 0 . The culture was 485 diluted to an OD 600 of 0 . 4 , and FM4 - 64 was added to a final concentration of 10 µM from a 486 10 mM stock in DMSO . Cells were labelled for 60 min with FM4 - 64 , washed three times in 487 fresh media by short and gentle centrifugation in a benchtop centrifuge , and then 488 incubated for 60 min in media without FM4 - 64 . Right before imaging , cells were 489 16 concentrated by a brief low - speed centrifugation , resuspended in 1 / 10 of their supernatant , 490 placed on a glass microscopy slide and overlaid with a 0 . 17 mm glass coverslip . Imaging 491 was done with a NIKON Ti2 spinning disc confocal microscope with a 100x 1 . 49 NA lens . 492 Z - stacks were taken with a spacing of 0 . 3 µm and assembled into maximum projections . 493 Image analysis was performed with ImageJ . Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to 494 quantify the colocalization between Vps10 and FM4 - 64 . The Nikon NIS - Elements Software 495 Pearson’s correlation tool was used on at least 5 single stacks containing at least 100 cells 496 each . All performed experiments were repeated at least three times . SEM calculation and 497 potting were done with Graphpad PRISM software . 498 499 Protein purification 500 TAP - tagged retromer complex was extracted from yeast as previously described 501 ( Purushothaman et al , 2017 ; Purushothaman & Ungermann , 2018 ) . Briefly , a 50 mL 502 preculture of cells was grown over night to saturation in YPGal medium . The next day , two 503 1L cultures in YPGal were inoculated with 15 mL of preculture and grown for 20 h to late 504 log phase ( OD 600 = 2 to 3 ) . All following steps were performed at 4°C . Cells were pelleted 505 and washed with 1 pellet volume of cold RP buffer ( retromer purification buffer : 50 mM Tris 506 pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM PMSF , Roche complete protease inhibitor ) . 507 Pellets were either processed immediately or flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 508 80°C . For cell lysis , the pellet was resuspended in one volume of RP buffer and passed 509 through a French press ( One shot cell disruptor , Constant Systems LTD , Daventry , UK ) at 510 2 . 2 Kpsi . 1 mg DNAse I was added to the lysate followed by a 20 min incubation on a 511 rotating wheel . The lysate was precleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 45’000 xg in a 512 Beckman JLA 25 . 50 rotor and cleared by a 60 min centrifugation at 150’000 xg in a 513 Beckman Ti60 rotor . The cleared supernatant was passed through a 0 . 2 µm filter and 514 transferred to a 50 mL Falcon tube . 1 mL IgG bead suspension ( GE Healthcare , cat 17 - 515 0969 - 01 ) was washed three times with RP buffer and added to the supernatant . After 60 516 min incubation on a rotating wheel , beads were spun down and washed 3 times with RP 517 buffer . 250 µg of purified HIS - TEV protease from E . coli was added to the beads . After 30 518 min incubation at 4°C , beads were centrifuged , the supernatant containing purified 519 retromer subcomplex was collected and concentrated on a 100 kDa cutoff column 520 ( Pierce™ Protein Concentrator PES , 100K MWCO ) . The concentrated protein fraction was 521 re - diluted in RP buffer and reconcentrated 3 times . This final step allowed for removal of 522 TEV protease and a high enrichment for intact complexes . Proteins were concentrated to 523 17 ~ 2 mg / mL , aliquoted in 10 µL fractions and flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen . Proteins were 524 stored at - 80°C and used within 3 months . Thawed aliquots were used only once . 525 526 Supported membrane tubes 527 Supported membrane tubes were generated as described ( Dar et al , 2015 ) . 528 Briefly , glass coverslips were first washed with 3 M NaOH for 5 min and rinsed with water 529 before a 60 min treatment with piranha solution ( 95 % H 2 SO 4 / 30 % H 2 O 2 3 : 2 v / v ) . 530 Coverslips were rinsed with water and dried on a heat block at 90°C . Coverslips were then 531 silanized with 3 - glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane ( Catalogue no . 440167 , Sigma ) for 5 h 532 under vacuum , rinsed with acetone and dried . Polyethylene glycol coating was done by 533 placing the coverslips in a beaker containing PEG400 ( Sigma ) at 90°C for 60 h . Coverslips 534 were washed with distilled water and stored for up to 2 months at room temperature in a 535 closed container . 536 To generate supported membrane tubes , lipids were mixed from 10 mg / mL stocks in a 537 glass vial and diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg / mL in chloroform . The same lipid mix 538 was used throughout this study ( 5 % PI ( 3 ) P , 15 % DOPS , 0 . 1 % fluorescent lipid tracer ( in 539 most cases Texas red DHPE ) , 79 . 5 % egg - PC ) . Lipids were then spotted ( typically 1 µL , 540 corresponding to about 1 nmol ) on the coverslips and dried for 30 min under vacuum . The 541 coverslip was mounted on an IBIDI 6 - channel µ - slide ( µ - Slide VI 0 . 4 . IBIDI , catalog no : 542 80606 ) . Lipids were hydrated for 15 min with buffer ( PBS ) and SMTs were generated by 543 injecting PBS into the chamber using an Aladdin Single - Syringe Pump ( World Precision 544 Instruments , model n° . AL - 1000 ) at a flow rate of 1 , 5 mL / min for 5 min . SMTs were left to 545 stabilize without flow for 5 min before the start of the experiment . Protein stocks ( typically 546 1 - 2 µM ) were first diluted in PBS and then injected in the chamber at a flow rate of 80 µL 547 per minute . Tubes were imaged with a NIKON Ti2 spinning disc confocal microscope 548 equipped with a 100x 1 . 49 NA objective . 549 550 Native - PAGE , SDS - PAGE and Western blotting 551 For analysis of CSC oligomer formation , 10 μL of purified CSC ( ~ 2 mg / mL ) were diluted 552 1 : 1 with water and incubated for 5 min at 25°C . Samples were run on a commercial native - 553 PAGE gel ( 3 to 12 % , Bis - Tris , 1 . 0 mm , Mini Protein Gel , 10 - well , Invitrogen , Cat . 554 BN1001BOX ) at 100 V tension using as running buffer 50 mM BisTris , 50mM Tricine , pH 555 6 . 8 ( Invitrogen number BN2007 ) . Cathode buffer : running buffer + 1 / 200 0 . 4 % Coomassie 556 G - 250 . Sample buffer : 50 mM BisTris , 6 N HCl , 50 mM NaCl , 10 % w / v Glycerol , 0 . 001 % 557 18 Ponceau S , pH 7 . 2 ) . Gels were run at 4° C . After the run , gels were then washed in 20 % 558 ethanol + 10 % acetic acid for 2 hours . 559 560 Quantifcation of SMT fluorescence 561 SMT fluorescence was quantified with ImageJ . Line scan analysis was performed along 562 tubules using an ImageJ plugin ( available as a txt file in the supplement ; see also Suppl . 563 Fig . 2 ) . Each line scan was performed perpendicular to the tubule . Scans were made along 564 the tubule with a one - pixel increment . For each line scan , a Gaussian curve was fitted , and 565 the maximum height was extracted . Maximum height was then plotted against the tube 566 length for all channels . For quantification of the diameters of the tubes , lipid fluorescence 567 values of a tubule underneath a constricted protein domain , extracted from the series of 568 line scans described above , was sorted in ascending order . The curve typically showed 569 two plateaus , the lower corresponding to the constricted state and the higher to the non - 570 constricted one . Plotting the corresponding GFP values confirmed that the GFP - labelled 571 protein localized to the constricted zone . For each tube , the zones corresponding to the 572 constricted and non - constricted areas were determined manually and the mean 573 fluorescence value was used to calculate the tube diameter . Tube diameter was calibrated 574 as described ( Dar et al , 2015 ) using purified human ΔPRD - dynamin - 1 ( Colom et al , 2017 ) 575 as a reference . 576 577 Tube Pulling 578 The experimental set - up used to aspirate GUVs with a micropipette and pull a membrane 579 tube was the same as previously reported ( Chiaruttini et al , 2015 ) combines bright - field 580 imaging , spinning disc confocal microscopy and optical tweezers on an inverted Nikon 581 Eclipse Ti microscope . GUVs were made by electro - formation as described ( Angelova et 582 al , 1992 ) . Briefly , lipid mix ( the same mix as for SMT experiments , supplemented with 583 0 . 03 % mol / mol of the biotinylated lipid DSPE - PEG2000 - Biotin , Avanti Polar Lipids , 584 Alabaster , AL , USA ) in chloroform was deposited on indium - titanium oxide glass slides and 585 dried for 60 min at 55°C to evaporate all solvents . GUVs were electroformed at 1 V and 10 586 Hz for 60 min at 55°C in a 380 mM sucrose solution . GUVs were then removed from the 587 chamber and placed in an Eppendorf tube until use . GUVs were used within 1 – 588 2 h after formation . A GUV is aspirated within a micropipette connected to a motorized 589 micromanipulator ( MP - 285 , Sutter Instrument , Novato , CA , USA ) and a homemade 590 pressure control system ( Zaber Micro linear actuator , Zaber Technologies Inc . , Canada ) 591 19 that sets the aspiration pressure ΔP . Then , a membrane nanotube is pulled out from the 592 vesicle through a streptavidin - coated bead ( 3 . 05 μm diameter , Spherotec , Lake Forest , IL , 593 USA ) held in a fixed optical trap . The optical trap was custom - made with a continuous 5 W 594 1064 nm fiber laser ( ML5 - CW - P - TKS - OTS , Manlight , Lannion , France ) focused through a 595 100X 1 . 3 NA oil immersion objective . The force F exerted on the bead was calculated from 596 Hooke’s law : F = k * Δx , where k is the stiffness of the trap ( k = 60 pN . μm −1 ) and Δx the 597 displacement of the bead from its equilibrium position . A mix of SNXs / CSC - mClover at 1 598 µM with 280 mosm osmolarity was injected with a micropipette connected to a motorized 599 micromanipulator and to the Fluigent pressure control system ( MFCS - VAC , −69 mbar ; 600 Fluigent ) . 601 602 CLEM 603 CLEM was performed as described ( Muriel et al , 2021 ; Kukulski et al , 2012 ) . Briefly , cells 604 of a logarithmically growing culture were concentrated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 605 min at RT . A few microliters of a thick cell slurry were pipetted onto a 3 - mm - wide and 0 . 1 - 606 mm deep specimen carrier ( Wohlwend type A ) closed with a flat lid ( Wohlwend type B ) . 607 The assembled carrier sandwich was high - pressure frozen using a Wohlwend HPF 608 Compact 02 and disassembled in liquid nitrogen . High - pressure frozen samples were 609 processed by freeze substitution and embedding in Lowicryl HM20 using the Leica AFS 2 610 robot as described ( Kukulski et al , 2012 ) . 300 nm sections were cut with a diamond knife 611 using a Leica ultramicrotome , collected in water and picked up on carbon - coated 200 - 612 mesh copper grids ( AGS160 ; Agar Scientific ) . For light microscopy the grid was placed 613 onto a drop of water and mounted onto a microscopy slide . Light microscopy images were 614 acquired on a NIKON Ti2 spinning disc confocal microscope with a 100x 1 . 49 NA lens . The 615 grid was recovered , dried and stained with Reynolds lead citrate for 10 min . 10 - nm protein 616 A - coupled gold beads were adsorbed to the top of the section as fiducials for tomography . 617 TEMs were acquired on a FEI Tecnai 12 at 120 kV using a bottom mount FEI Eagle 618 camera ( 4k x 4k ) . For tomographic reconstruction , tilt series were acquired over a tilt range 619 of ± 60° at 1° increments using the Serial EM software . Tomogram reconstruction was 620 performed using the IMOD software package with gold fiducial alignment . 621 622 623 Mammalian cell experiments 624 20 All chemical reagents were from Sigma - Aldrich unless specified otherwise . Other rea - 625 gents : Opti - MEM ( Thermo Fischer , 11058021 ) and Trypsin ( Thermo Fischer , 27250018 ) ; 626 LysoTracker® Deep Red ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , L12492 ; Protease inhibitor ( PI ) cocktail 627 ( final concentrations : 40 M pefablock SC ( Merck , 11429876001 ) , 2 . 1 M leupeptin ( Merck , 628 11529048001 ) , 80 µ M o - phenantroline ( Merck , 131377 ) , 1 . 5 µ M pepstatin A ( Merck , 629 11524488001 ) . 630 631 Cell culture , transfection and treatments 632 HK2 cells were grown in DMEM - HAM’s F12 ( GIBCO - Life Technologies ) ; supplemented 633 with 5 % fetal calf serum , 50 IU / mL penicillin , 50 mg / mL streptomycin , 5 μg / mL insulin , 5 634 μg / mL transferrin , 5 ng / mL selenium ( LuBio Science ) . Cells were grown at 37°C in 5 % 635 CO2 and at 98 % humidity . Media , serum and reagents for tissue culture were purchased 636 from GIBCO ( Invitrogen ) . HK2 cells were transfected with different plasmids using X - 637 tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent ( Sigma - Aldrich ) according to the manufacturer ' s 638 instructions . Briefly , the plasmid was diluted with Opti - MEM I Medium without serum to a 639 final concentration of 1 μg plasmid DNA / 100 μl medium ( 0 . 01 μg / μl ) and gently mixed . 640 Then , 3 μl of X - tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent was added directly into the 641 medium containing the diluted DNA . The transfection reagent : DNA complex was incu - 642 bated for 30 at room temperature under the hood . Finally , the transfection complex was 643 added to the cells in a dropwise manner and they were incubated 24 hours at 37°C in a 644 CO 2 incubator . 645 The HK - 2 cell line was checked for mycoplasma contamination by a PCR - based method . 646 All cell - based experiments were repeated at least three times . 647 648 Knockouts and RNA interference 649 For RNA interference , HK2 cells were plated in 24well - plate and then transfected with 650 siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . For each well to be trans - 651 fected , was first prepared the RNAi duplex - Lipofectamine RNAiMAX complexes as follows : 652 6 pmol of RNAi duplex were diluted in 100 µl Opti - MEM I Medium without serum in the well 653 of the culture plate and gently mixed . Then , 1 µl Lipofectamine RNAiMAX was added to 654 each well containing the diluted RNAi molecules , gently mixed and incubated for 20 655 minutes at room temperature under sterile conditions . In that time cells were detached , 656 counted , and diluted in complete growth medium without antibiotics so that 500 µl contains 657 the appropriate number of cells to give 30 % confluence 24 hours after plating . After the 20 658 21 minutes of incubation at room temperature to each well with RNAi duplex - Lipofectamine 659 RNAiMAX complexes were added 500 µl of the diluted cells . This gives a final volume of 660 600 µl and a final RNA concentration of 10 nM . The 24well - plate was gently mixed gently 661 by rocking and incubated 24 - 72 hours at 37°C in a CO2 incubator . 662 The siRNA targeting VPS35 was from Sigma ( 5’ CTGGACATATTTATCAATATA 3’ ; 3’ TA - 663 TATTGATAAATATGTCCAG 5’ ) . It was used at 10 nM final concentration . Control cells 664 were treated with identical concentrations of siGENOME Control Pool Non - Targeting from 665 Dharmacon ( D - 001206 - 13 - 05 ) . 666 667 Immunostaining 668 HK2 cells were grown to 70 % confluence on glass coverslips before immunofluorescence 669 microscopy was performed . Cells were fixed for 10 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS 670 ( phosphate - buffered saline ) . After fixation , cells were incubated ( 30 min at room tempera - 671 ture ) in blocking buffer with ( permeabilized cells ) or without ( non - permeabilized cells ) 672 0 . 05 % ( w : v ) saponin ( Sigma - Aldrich , 558255 ) , 0 . 5 % ( w : v ) BSA and 50 mM NH 4 Cl in PBS . 673 The cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody in blocking buffer , washed three 674 times in PB and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody in blocking buffer . Then , 675 cells were washed three times in PBS , mounted with Mowiol ( Sigma - Aldrich , 475904 - M ) 676 on slides and analysed by confocal microscopy . 677 Primary antibodies were anti - LAMP1 ( H4A3 , USBiologicvak Life Sciences ) and anti - Glut1 678 ( ab15309 Abcam ) . Secondary antibodies were Cy3 - conjugated AffiniPure Donkey anti - 679 Mouse IgG H + L ( Jackson Immuno Research ) ; Cy3 - conjugated AffiniPure Donkey anti - 680 Rabbit IgG H + L ( Jackson Immuno Research ) ; Alexa fluor Ò 488 - conjugated AffiniPure Don - 681 key anti - Rabbit IgG H + L ( Jackson Immuno Research ) . 682 683 Confocal fluorescence microscopy and image processing . 684 Confocal microscopy was performed on an inverted confocal laser microscope ( Zeiss LSM 685 880 with airyscan ) with a 63x 1 . 4 NA oil immersion lens . Z - stack Images were acquired on 686 a Zeiss LSM880 microscope with Airyscan . GLUT1 - fluorescence was quantified using Im - 687 ageJ . Individual cells were selected using the freeform drawing tool to create a ROI ( ROI ) . 688 The ‘Measure’ function provided the area , the mean grey value and integrated intensity of 689 the ROI . The mean background level was obtained by measuring the intensity in three dif - 690 ferent regions outside the cells , dividing them by the area of the regions measured , and 691 22 averaging the values obtained . This background noise was removed from each cell , yield - 692 ing the CTCF ( corrected total cell fluorescence ) : CTCF = integrated intensity of cell ROI − 693 ( area of ROI × mean fluorescence of background ) . 694 To quantify the degree of co - localisation , confocal z - stacks were acquired . Single chan - 695 nels from each image in 8 - bit format were thresholded to subtract background and then 696 the " Just Another Colocalisation Plug - in " ( JACOP ) of ImageJ was used to measure the 697 Pearson’s correlation coefficient . 698 699 Gel electrophoresis and Western blot 700 Ctrl and Vps35 - KD HK2 cells were plated into 12 - well tissue culture test plates ( TPP ) until 701 72h after transfection with the siRNAs . Cells were then washed three times with ice - cold 702 PBS , scraped , and proteins were extracted in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM 703 EDTA , 40 mM HEPES , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) supplemented with phosphatase ( Roche 704 # 04906837001 ) and protease inhibitor cocktail .

Protein extracts were supplemented with 1 / 4 volume of 5x reducing sam - 708 ple buffer ( 250 mM Tris - Cl , pH 6 . 8 , 5 % β - mercaptoethanol , 10 % SDS , 30 % glycerol , 709 0 . 02 % bromophenol blue ) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min . The samples were run on SDS - 710 polyacrylamide gels ( W x L x H : 8 . 6 x 6 . 8 x 0 . 15 cm ) . Running gels were either 8 % or 4 - 711 16 % protogel ( 30 % w / v acrylamide , 0 . 8 % bisacrylamide ( 37 . 5 : 1 solution , National diagnos - 712 tics , Atlanta , USA ) , , 0 . 38 M Tris , pH 8 . 8 , 0 . 1 % w / v SDS ( Applichem , 475904 - M ) , 0 . 06 % 713 TEMED ( Applichem , A1148 ) , 0 . 06 % w / v APS ( Applichem , A2941 ) . The stacking gels were 714 prepared as follows : 6 % acrylamide , 0 . 16 % bis - acrylamide , 0 . 1 M Tris , pH 6 . 8 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 715 0 . 1 % TEMED , 0 . 05 % ammonium persulfate . The gels were run at constant current ( 35 716 mA ) . Proteins were blotted onto 0 . 45 µm nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham ) overnight 717 at a constant current of 200 mA using a Trans - Blot® Cell ( Bio - Rad , USA ) . 718 After incubation with the primary antibody , signals were detected by secondary antibodies 719 coupled to infrared dyes ( LI - COR ) and detected on a LI - COR Odyssey Infrared Imager . 720 Images were exported as TIFF files and processed in Adobe Photoshop . Band intensity 721 was quantified using ImageJ band analysis ( Schneider CA et al . , 2012 ) . We used anti - 722 LAMP1 ( H4A3 , USBiologicvak Life Sciences ) , anti - Tubulin ( T9026 Sigma - Aldrich ) anti - 723 Vps35 ( ab10099 Abcam , ab157220 Abcam ) . 724 725 23 Statistics 726 Where averages were calculated , the values stem from experiments that were performed 727 independently . For all experiments , significance of differences was tested by a two - tailed t - 728 test . 729 730 731 Acknowledgements 732 We thank Christian Ungermann for strains expressing CSC and SNX .
