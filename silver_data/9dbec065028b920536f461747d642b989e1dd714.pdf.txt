Two types of evolutionally conserved Ca 2 + - binding sites have been identified in this family ; type - 1 ( between gelsolin and actin ) and type - 2 ( within the gelsolin domain ) . Fragmin , a member in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum , consists of three domains ( F1 – F3 ) that are highly similar to the N - terminal half of mammalian gelsolin ( G1 – G3 ) . Despite their similarities , the two proteins exhibit a significant difference in the Ca 2 + dependency ; F1 – F3 absolutely requires Ca 2 + for the filament severing whereas G1 – G3 does not . In this study , we examined the strong dependency of frag - min on Ca 2 + using biochemical and structural approaches . Our co - sedimentation assay demonstrated that Ca 2 + significantly enhanced the binding of F2 – F3 to actin . We determined the crystal structure of F2 – F3 in the presence of Ca 2 + . F2 – F3 binds a total of three calcium ions ; while two are located in type - 2 sites within F2 or F3 , the remaining one resides between the F2 long helix and the F3 short helix . The inter - domain Ca 2 + - coordination appears to stabilize F2 - F3 in a closely packed configuration . Notably , the F3 long helix exhibits a bent conformation which is different from the straight G3 long helix in the presence of Ca 2 + . Our results provide the first structural evidence for the existence of an unconventional Ca 2 + - binding site in the gelsolin superfamily proteins . Keywords Actin dynamics · Gelsolin superfamily proteins · Ca 2 + - binding site · X - ray crystal structure · Actin filament severing Introduction Temporal and spatial regulations of the actin cytoskel - eton are implicated in diverse biological processes such as cell movement and myofibrillogenesis . Because the total amount of actin is limited in the cytosol , cells are equipped with recycling systems that can dismantle existing actin filaments and provide monomers as a polymerizable pool ( Pollard and Borisy 2003 ) . A key reaction for accelerating actin disassembly is filament severing , which is engaged mainly by two families of proteins . ADF / cofilin selectively severs the aged ADP - bound filaments ( Carlier et al . 1997 ; Andrianantoandro and Pollard 2006 ) through coopera - tive binding to the side of the polymer ( McGough et al . 1997 ; De La Cruz 2005 ; Ngo et al . 2015 ; Tanaka et al . 2018 ) . By contrast , gelsolin and its related proteins ( gel - solin superfamily proteins ) are able to sever actin filaments with only a single molecule and remain associated with the barbed end produced by the reaction , thereby preventing filament growth at this dynamic end and facilitating the Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s1097 4 - 019 - 09571 - 5 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . * Shuichi Takeda takeda . shuichi @ f . mbox . nagoya - u . ac . jp 1 Structural Biology Research Center , Graduate School of Science , Nagoya University , Furo - cho , Chikusa - ku , Nagoya 464 - 8601 , Japan 2 Frontier Research Institute for Materials Science , Nagoya Institute of Technology , Gokiso , Showa - ku , Nagoya 466 - 8555 , Japan 3 Graduate School of Science , Osaka City University , Sugimoto , Sumiyoshi - ku , Osaka 558 - 8585 , Japan 4 Nagoya University Synchrotron Radiation Center , Furo - cho , Chikusa - ku , Nagoya 464 - 0965 , Japan 5 Faculty of Health and Welfare , Tokai Gakuin University , Nakakirino - cyo 5 - 68 , Kakamigahara , Gifu 504 - 8511 , Japan 6 Toyota Physical and Chemical Research Institute , Yokomichi 41 - 1 , Nagakute , Aichi 480 - 1192 , Japan 154 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 153 – 162 1 3 depolymerization from the other end ( pointed end ) ( Sun et al . 1999 ; Nag et al . 2013 ) . The filament severing activity of gelsolin superfamily proteins is controlled by Ca 2 + . In the absence of Ca 2 + , the full - length gelsolin adopts a tightly packed configu - ration in which the actin binding sites are buried inside the molecule ( Burtnick et al . 1997 ; Nag et al . 2009 ) . This auto - inhibition is relieved by the binding of Ca 2 + , induc - ing a global conformational change in the gelsolin mol - ecule which in turn exposes the actin binding sites ( Rob - inson et al . 1999 ; Burtnick et al . 2004 ; Nag et al . 2009 ) . The Ca 2 + - binding sites in gelsolin superfamily proteins are categorized into two types of sites ; inter - molecular sites formed between gelsolin domains and actin ( type - 1 ) and intra - molecular sites located within gelsolin domains ( type - 2 ) ( McLaughlin et al . 1993 ; Robinson et al . 1999 ; Burtnick et al . 2004 ) . Biochemical and structural evidence suggest that the binding of Ca 2 + to type - 2 sites is essential to convert the overall molecular conformation compatible with actin filament binding , whereas the Ca 2 + coordination in the type - 1 sites is key to achieving the severing reaction ( Nag et al . 2013 ) . Gelsolin consists of structurally similar six domains ( G1 – G6 ) . Although less than the full length gelsolin , the N - terminal three domains ( G1 – G3 ) alone are sufficient to sever actin filaments and to cap the barbed ends ( Kotha - kota et al . 1997 ; Selden et al . 1998 ) . Based on structural and biochemical studies , the filament severing by G1 – G3 has been proposed as a two - step reaction ; ( 1 ) initial target - ing of G1 – G3 through the binding of G2 – G3 to the bound - ary between two longitudinally adjacent actin subunits in an actin filament , and , ( 2 ) binding of G1 to the barbed end subunit that conducts a severing due to steric clashes that would occur between G1 and the further barbed end subunit ( Burtnick et al . 2004 ; Nag et al . 2013 ) . Interestingly , unlike the full length G1 – G6 , G1 – G3 is able to sever actin fila - ments without Ca 2 + ( Way et al . 1989 ; Kothakota et al . 1997 ; Selden et al . 1998 ) . Fragmin is a member of the gelsolin superfamily pro - teins in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum ( Hasegawa et al . 1980 ; Hinssen 1981a , b ) . In the amoeba cell , fragmin is localized predominantly beneath the plasma membrane , thus implicating a role for organizing the subcortical actin meshwork ( T’Jampens et al . 1997 ) . Fragmin is composed of only three domains ( F1 – F3 ) that share high sequence simi - larity ( 57 % identity ) to gelsolin G1 – G3 ( T’Jampens et al . 1997 ) . Both type - 1 and type - 2 Ca 2 + - binding site residues are conserved in fragmin . Fragmin F1 – F3 severs actin filaments ( Hasegawa et al . 1980 ; Hinssen 1981a , b ; Gettemans et al . 1995 ) , most probably by the two - step mechanism proposed for gelsolin G1 – G3 . However , in contrast to G1 – G3 that is constitutively active , fragmin absolutely requires Ca 2 + for its severing reaction ( Hasegawa et al . 1980 ; Hinssen 1981b ; Gettemans et al . 1995 ) , suggesting that there may be an addi - tional role for Ca 2 + in activating fragmin . In this study , we focused on the strong Ca 2 + dependency of fragmin activation . We performed a co - sedimentation assay and revealed that the binding of F2 – F3 , the filament targeting unit of fragmin , to actin filaments is strictly regu - lated by Ca 2 + . We solved the crystal structure of F2 – F3 in the presence of Ca 2 + and found a calcium ion binding to an unconventional site located between F2 and F3 domains . The structure of the F3 domain is substantially different from that of G3 in the active form , most notably the conformation of the long helix . We found that the novel metal binding site favors Ca 2 + rather than Mg 2 + for completing the coordina - tion sphere . Our results provide the first structural evidence for the existence of an unconventional Ca 2 + - binding site in the gelsolin superfamily proteins . Methods Protein purification The cDNA of P . polycephalum fragmin was a kind gift from Dr . Jan Gettemans ( T’Jampens et al . 1997 ) . Fragmin F2 - F3 ( residues 162 – 371 ) or F3 ( residues 276 – 371 ) were genetically engineered into the expression vector pGEX - 6P - 1 ( GE Healthcare ) , encoding an N - terminal glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - tag , followed by a prescission protease cleavage site ahead of the N - terminus of fragmin domains . Human gelsolin G2 – G3 ( residues 156 – 370 ) was cloned into pGEX - 6P - 1 with the same architecture as the frag - min constructs . The recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells ( Thermofisher ) and were affinity - purified using a glutathione resin . After the GST - tag removal by prescission protease , the proteins were further purified by a gel filtration column ( Sephacryl S200 16 / 60 ; GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with the following solu - tions ; 2 mM Tris – HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT ( for F2 – F3 and F3 ) , or 2 mM MES - NaOH ( pH 6 . 0 ) , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ( for G2 – G3 ) . Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg / ml . Actin was purified from acetone powder of chicken skel - etal muscle by one cycle of polymerization and depolym - erization ( Spudich and Watt 1971 ) and was stored on ice in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris – HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . Co‑sedimentation assay Various concentrations of fragmin F2 – F3 or gelsolin G2 – G3 domains were mixed with the polymerized actin ( 3 . 2 µM constant ) in KMEI buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole – HCl ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 1 mM DTT , 155 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 153 – 162 1 3 0 . 2 mM ATP ) with or without 100 µM CaCl 2 . The reac - tion mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room tempera - ture , then centrifuged at 100 , 000 rpm for 45 min at 12 °C ( S140AT - rotor ; Hitachi ) . To quantify the amounts of bound and unbound F2 – F3 or G2 – G3 to actin filaments , samples in the pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and the band densities were quantified by Image J ( Schneider et al . 2012 ) . Experiments were performed at least three times for each condition . Binding affinities ( K d s ) were estimated as described previously ( Fujiwara et al . 2014 ) . Crystallization , data collection and structure determination Fragmin F2 – F3 , F3 or gelsolin G2 – G3 in the gel filtration buffers were supplemented with 10 mM CaCl 2 ( for F2 – F3 Ca , F3 Ca and G3 Ca ) or with 10 mM CaCl 2 and 10 mM MgCl 2 ( for F2 – F3 CaMg or G3 CaMg ) . Note we refer to the gelsolin crystals as G3 cation because the G2 domain was missing in the final structures , due to a proteolytic digestion occurring during the crystallization process ( Fig . S3 ) . Crystals were obtained by sitting - drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C using a 0 . 5 µl protein solution mixed with a 0 . 5 µl crystalli - zation solution composed of 100 mM ammonium sulfate and 22 . 5 – 27 . 5 % PEG 3350 ( F2 – F3 and G3 crystals ) or 100 mM MES - NaOH ( pH 6 . 0 ) and 20 % PEG 3350 ( F3 Ca ) . Prior to data collection , crystals were transferred to a cryoprotec - tion solution ( the crystallization solution supplemented with 20 % glycerol ) , and flash cooled in a cold nitrogen stream . X - ray data sets were collected on beamline BL2S1 at Aichi synchrotron radiation center ( Watanabe et al . 2017 ) with a wavelength of 1 . 12 Å , at 90 K . The data sets were integrated and scaled using XDS ( Kabsch 2010 ) . We selected high res - olution cut off according to the CC ( 1 / 2 ) values better than 0 . 5 . The structures were solved by molecular replacement with Molrep ( Vagin and Teplyakov 2010 ) using correspond - ing gelsolin domains excised from G1 – G3 : actin complex structure ( PDB entry ; 3ffk ) ( Nag et al . 2009 ) as a search model . Manual model building and refinement were per - formed with Coot ( Emsley et al . 2010 ) and Phenix ( Afonine et al . 2012 ) . We did not use distance restraints for refining metal binding sites . Summary of data collection and refine - ment statistics are shown in Table 1 . SAXS measurement Fragmin F2 – F3 , protein concentrations from 1 to 3 mg / ml , were prepared in the KMEI buffer ( – Ca 2 + condition ) or in the KMEI buffer supplemented with 1 mM CaCl 2 ( + Ca 2 + condition ) . The SAXS measurement was car - ried out using the BL8S3 beamline at Aichi synchrotron radiation center , with the wavelength of incident X - ray of 1 . 50 Å . The sample - to - detector distance was 2 . 18 m . The scattering patterns were recorded using a pixel detector ( PILATUS 100 K , Dectris ) and were circularly averaged to obtain one - dimensional scattering curves . The inten - sity of these curves was corrected by the incident beam flux measured with an ion chamber placed upstream of the samples . The net scattering curves of the proteins were obtained by subtracting the scattering curves of the buffer from those of the samples . The radii of gyration ( R g ) and the pair distance distribution functions ( p ( r ) ) were calcu - lated with the program PRIMUS ( Konarev et al . 2003 ) and the programs suite of ATSAS ( Franke et al . 2017 ) . The R g values of zero concentrations were obtained from linear extrapolation . We could not obtain the SAXS parameters of gelsolin G2 – G3 due to the heavy aggregation occurred by X - ray irradiation to the sample . Results F2 – F3 binds to actin filaments in a Ca 2 + ‑dependent manner To evaluate the fragmin binding to actin filaments , we per - formed a co - sedimentation assay . For the assay , we used F2 – F3 domains ( residues 162 – 371 ) that does not include the F1 domain which is crucial for severing actin filament . F2 – F3 was co - sedimented with actin filaments in the pres - ence of 100 µM Ca 2 + ( Fig . 1a ) . The binding was nearly saturated at 1 : 1 molar ratio with the estimated binding affinity ( K d ) of 0 . 042 ± 0 . 051 µM ( Fig . 1c ) . By contrast , F2 – F3 weakly bound to actin filaments in the absence of Ca 2 + ( Fig . 1b , c ; K d = 30 . 2 ± 2 . 2 µM ) . Although both esti - mated K d s of F2 – F3 to actin filaments with and without Ca 2 + are beyond the concentration range of our experimen - tal conditions ( F2 – F3 concentrations from 0 . 3 to 15 µM ) , our results indicate that Ca 2 + significantly enhanced the binding of F2 – F3 to actin . We performed the same assay by using a functional counterpart of gelsolin , G2 – G3 domains ( residues 156 – 370 ) . As demonstrated previously ( Way et al . 1992 ) , G2 – G3 bound to actin filaments regardless of Ca 2 + ( Fig . 1d , e ) . The estimated K d s between G2 – G3 and actin obtained from our experiment are 0 . 64 ± 0 . 15 µM ( + Ca 2 + ) and 0 . 78 ± 0 . 14 µM ( − Ca 2 + ) ( Fig . 1f ) , which are compa - rable to those reported previously ; 0 . 2 µM ( + Ca 2 + ) ( Yin et al . 1988 ) , 2 . 0 µM ( + Ca 2 + ) and 3 . 6 µM ( − Ca 2 + ) ( Way et al . 1992 ) . These results show that F2 – F3 binds to actin filaments ~ 15 folds stronger than G2 – G3 in the presence of Ca 2 + . Taken together , our data suggest that actin fila - ment targeting mediated by F2 – F3 is a process controlled by Ca 2 + . 156 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 153 – 162 1 3 Overall structure of F2 – F3 in the presence of Ca 2 + To understand the structural basis for the strong Ca 2 + - dependency of F2 – F3 in the filament targeting , we crystalized F2 – F3 in the presence of 10 mM CaCl 2 . The structure , referred to as F2 – F3 Ca , was determined at 2 . 15 Å resolution ( Fig . 2a ) . Each F2 and F3 domain in F2 – F3 Ca exhibits a conserved gelsolin fold ; a central five - stranded β - sheet is sandwiched between long and short α - helices ( McLaughlin et al . 1993 ) . In the crystal structures of gelsolin superfamily proteins obtained with - out Ca 2 + , domains 2 and 3 are spatially separated by an insertion of domain 1 ( Burtnick et al . 1997 ; Nag et al . 2009 ; Chumnarnsilpa et al . 2015 ) . In F2 – F3 Ca , F2 and F3 domains are directly associated , with a similar orienta - tion of G2 and G3 binding to actin ( Burtnick et al . 2004 ; Nag et al . 2009 ) , indicating that F2 – F3 Ca adopts the active conformation without actin . The Ca 2 + - dependent , actin - free activation was demonstrated for the C - terminal half of gelsolin ( G4 – G6 ) ( Kolappan et al . 2003 ; Narayan et al . 2003 ) , but has not been reported for G1 – G3 . Type‑2 Ca 2 + ‑binding sites in F2 – F3 Ca Like crystal structures of gelsolin domains obtained under Ca 2 + - saturated conditions , conserved intra - domain Ca 2 + - binding sites , i . e . , type - 2 sites , within F2 and F3 are fully occupied by Ca 2 + ( Fig . 2a – c ) . The residues involved in the Ca 2 + - coordination in the F2 and F3 type - 2 sites are equivalent to those in the reported gelsolin structures ( sequence alignment of F2 – F3 and G2 – G3 is shown in Fig . S1 ) ; a glutamate residue at the N - terminus of the long helix and an aspartate residue at N - terminal to the third strand ( McLaughlin et al . 1993 ; Robinson et al . 1999 ; Burtnick et al . 2004 ) . In F2 type - 2 site , Asp267 positions in the linker between F2 and F3 ( magenta in Fig . 2b ) also participates in the Ca 2 + coordination , as observed in a crystal structure of gelsolin G1 – G3 in complex with actin ( Nag et al . 2009 ) Table 1 Data collection and refinement statistics F2 – F3 Ca F2 – F3 CaMg F3 Ca G3 Ca G3 CaMg Data collection Space group P 6 1 P 6 1 P 2 1 2 1 2 1 C 2 C 2 Unit cell dimensions a , b , c ( Å ) 115 . 8 , 115 . 8 , 42 . 1 115 . 6 , 115 . 6 , 42 . 2 46 . 7 , 55 . 1 , 69 . 9 58 . 4 , 41 . 8 , 84 . 6 58 . 9 , 41 . 2 , 84 . 6 α , β , γ ( o ) 90 . 0 , 90 . 0 , 120 . 0 90 . 0 , 90 . 0 , 120 . 0 90 . 0 , 90 . 0 , 90 . 0 90 . 0 , 105 . 2 , 90 . 0 90 . 0 , 105 . 5 , 90 . 0 Resolution range ( Å ) 42 . 12 – 2 . 15 ( 2 . 28 – 2 . 15 ) 42 . 24 – 1 . 85 ( 1 . 96 – 1 . 85 ) 44 . 65 – 1 . 55 ( 1 . 65 – 1 . 55 ) 40 . 81 – 1 . 50 ( 1 . 59 – 1 . 50 ) 40 . 75 – 1 . 40 ( 1 . 49 – 1 . 40 ) R merge 0 . 091 ( 0 . 997 ) 0 . 064 ( 1 . 037 ) 0 . 076 ( 1 . 222 ) 0 . 054 ( 0 . 597 ) 0 . 045 ( 0 . 744 ) CC ( 1 / 2 ) 0 . 998 ( 0 . 586 ) 0 . 999 ( 0 . 557 ) 0 . 999 ( 0 . 519 ) 0 . 999 ( 0 . 620 ) 0 . 998 ( 0 . 542 ) I / σ 11 . 91 ( 1 . 44 ) 16 . 75 ( 1 . 40 ) 10 . 99 ( 1 . 14 ) 12 . 16 ( 1 . 46 ) 10 . 99 ( 1 . 07 ) Completeness ( % ) 99 . 8 ( 99 . 2 ) 99 . 9 ( 99 . 6 ) 99 . 6 ( 98 . 8 ) 97 . 5 ( 96 . 0 ) 95 . 2 ( 91 . 5 ) Redundancy 4 . 4 ( 4 . 4 ) 4 . 4 ( 4 . 3 ) 3 . 5 ( 3 . 2 ) 2 . 5 ( 2 . 4 ) 2 . 4 ( 2 . 2 ) Refinement Resolution range ( Å ) 38 . 83 – 2 . 15 33 . 37 – 1 . 85 35 . 60 – 1 . 55 33 . 58 – 1 . 50 33 . 36 – 1 . 40 No . reflections 17 , 830 27 , 811 26 , 657 31 , 474 37 , 259 R work / R free 0 . 190 / 0 . 226 0 . 182 / 0 . 207 0 . 188 / 0 . 220 0 . 168 / 0 . 205 0 . 182 / 0 . 201 No . of atoms Protein 1614 1631 1571 1629 1621 Ligand 27 33 2 14 25 Water 181 301 262 312 264 Average B factor Protein 45 . 30 34 . 04 22 . 92 19 . 15 22 . 31 Ligand 56 . 24 43 . 43 18 . 10 28 . 38 35 . 35 Water 50 . 05 43 . 07 33 . 44 33 . 14 35 . 18 Ramachandran plot Favored ( % ) 98 . 5 98 . 1 99 . 5 99 . 0 99 . 5 Outliers ( % ) 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 RMSD bond lengths ( Å ) 0 . 005 0 . 007 0 . 008 0 . 015 0 . 006 RMSD bond angles ( o ) 0 . 73 0 . 88 0 . 91 1 . 37 0 . 85 157 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 153 – 162 1 3 Fig . 1 Co - sedimentation assay . Binding of fragmin F2 – F3 ( a – c ) or gelsolin G2 – G3 ( d – f ) to actin filaments were examined by high speed co - sedimentation assays . Various amount of F2 – F3 or G2 – G3 were mixed with a constant amount ( 3 . 2 µM ) of actin in KMEI buffer sup - plemented with 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ( a and d ) or 0 mM CaCl 2 ( b and e ) . The samples were centrifuged to separate filament - bound ( pellet : P ) and unbound ( supernatant : S ) fractions and analyzed by SDS - PAGE ( each gel was framed by black lines ) . Molar ratios of F2 – F3 / G2 – G3 to actin are indicated above each lane . In c and f , the bound F2 – F3 or G2 – G3 to actin over the total amounts of F2 – F3 of G2 – G3 , in the presence of Ca 2 + ( open symbols ) and absence of Ca 2 + ( closed sym - bols ) , were plotted . The estimated binding affinities ( K d s ) to actin filaments are followings ; 0 . 042 ± 0 . 051 µM ( F2 – F3 in 0 . 1 mM Ca 2 + ) and 30 . 2 ± 2 . 2 µM ( F2 – F3 in 0 mM Ca 2 + ) , 0 . 64 ± 0 . 15 µM ( G2 – G3 in 0 . 1 mM Ca 2 + ) and 0 . 78 ± 0 . 14 µM ( G2 – G3 in 0 mM Ca 2 + ) .

Our structure thus supports the notion that Ca 2 + binding to the type - 2 site of domain 2 plays a key role in the activation of gelsolin superfamily proteins , through stabilizing the contact between domains 2 and 3 ( Kazmirski et al . 2002 ; Nag et al . 2009 ; Chumnarn - silpa et al . 2015 ) . Novel inter‑domain Ca 2 + ‑binding site in F2 – F3 Ca Surprisingly , besides the two calcium ions coordinated in the conserved type - 2 sites , we found an additional calcium ion in F2 – F3 Ca ( Fig . 2a ) . The novel Ca 2 + binding site is located between the two domains where the Ca 2 + is liganded with an octahedral coordination geometry by Glu221 on the F2 long helix , Asp368 and Asp371 on the F3 short helix and a water molecule ( Fig . 2d ) . Asp371 is the C - terminal residue of fragmin and exhibits a bidentate coordination via its side chain and main chain oxygens ( Fig . 2d ) . The B - factor of the Ca 2 + at the inter - domain site is 43 . 7 Å 2 , which is comparable to those of the two type - 2 sites ( F2 : 37 . 9 Å 2 , F3 : 44 . 9 Å 2 ) . We performed occupancy refinement for the three calcium ions in F2 – F3 Ca and found that all of the Ca 2 + - binding sites are fully occupied by Ca 2 + . These data suggest that like the conserved type - 2 sites , the inter - domain site stably binds Ca 2 + . Structural comparison between F2 – F3 Ca and G2 – G3 Despite a high amino acid sequence similarity between F2 – F3 and G2 – G3 ( 50 % similarity : Fig . S1 ) , the structure of F2 – F3 Ca is significantly different from that of G2 – G3 in Ca 2 + - saturated form ( PDB 3ffk : Cα RMSD = 2 . 35 Å ) ( Fig . 3a ) . This is partly due to the mismatch in the orienta - tion of two domains . In F2 – F3 Ca , the inter - domain Ca 2 + coordinated between F2 and F3 brings the two helices , F2 long helix and F3 short helix , into alignment in a paral - lel , zipper - like configuration ( Fig . 3b ) . As a result , the two Fig . 3 Structural comparisons of F2 – F3 Ca with gelsolin G2 – G3 .

Pairs of single domain structures are superposed as follows : F2 from F2 – F3 Ca and G2 from 3ffk ( c ) , F3 from F2 – F3 Ca and G3 from 3ffk ( d ) , F3 from F2 – F3 Ca and F3 from F3 Ca ( e ) , G3 from 3ffk and G3 from G3 Ca ( f ) . The main chain RMSDs are indicated . g Conformation of domain 3 long helix . The long helices are excised from the domain 3 structures . In addition to the four domain 3 structures shown in c – f , G3 long helix from the crystal structure of G1 – G6 ( − Ca 2 + ) is also shown for comparison 159 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 153 – 162 1 3 domains associated with each other more closely , compared to G2 and G3 in the active form . The Ca 2 + bound to the inter - domain site appears to stabilize the F2 – F3 interface formed between two negatively charged surfaces ( Fig . S2a and b ) . We note that the difference in the domain orienta - tion may also be due to the lack of a ligand ( i . e . , actin ) in F2 – F3 Ca or to distinct crystal lattices . Differences in the structures are observed within domains . The structure of F2 ( residues 164 – 252 ) in F2 – F3 Ca is similar to that of G2 ( residues 159 – 248 of 3ffk ) with Cα RMSD of 0 . 61 Å ( Fig . 3c ) . In contrast , the structure of F3 ( residues 278 – 371 ) is substantially different from that of G3 ( residues 272 – 367 ; Cα RMSD = 1 . 46 Å ) ( Fig . 3d ) . Significant struc - tural deviations ( RMSD > 3 Å ) are observed in less con - served regions ( Figs . S1 and S2c ) : a loop C - terminal to the second strand ( F3 residues 297 – 301 ) and a linker connecting the third and the fourth strands ( 315 – 317 ) . A region N - ter - minal to the short helix ( 361 – 364 ) also shows a large devia - tion probably reflecting a flexibility of the G3 short helix which does not closely engaged with the G2 long helix . The conformation of the long helix is also different between F3 and G3 . In reported structures of gelsolin superfamily pro - teins determined under Ca 2 + - saturated conditions , long heli - ces in domain 3 adopted a straight conformation ( McLaugh - lin et al . 1993 ; Nag et al . 2009 ; Chumnarnsilpa et al . 2015 ) . Strikingly , despite the presence of calcium ions in F2 – F3 Ca , its long helix exhibits a bent conformation , resembling the G3 long helix in the inactive form ( 3ffn ) ( Fig . 3g ) . Note that although F3 from the Ca 2 + - bound F2 – F3 Ca and G3 from the Ca 2 + - free G1 – G6 ( 3ffn ) resemble each other at the long helix conformation , their overall domain structures differ significantly ( Cα RMSD = 1 . 46 Å : superposed structure is not shown ) . Crystal structures of the F3 and G3 domains in the presence of Ca 2 + We crystalized the isolated F3 domain in the presence of Ca 2 + . The structure , F3 Ca , was determined at 1 . 55 Å resolution ( Fig . S2d ) . F3 Ca binds one calcium ion at its type - 2 site and the inter domain site is open . The structure of F3 Ca is almost identical to that of F3 in F2 – F3 Ca ( Cα RMSD = 0 . 39 Å ) ( Fig . 3d ) . The long helix exhibits a curved conformation . This suggests that neither the inter - domain Ca 2 + - coordination nor the packing with the F2 domain affect the structure of the F3 domain including the long helix conformation . Like F3 Ca , an isolated G3 domain also resembles the G3 domain in multi - domain forms ( Fig . 3f ) . We attempted to crystallize G2 – G3 , used in the co - sedimentation assay , in the presence of CaCl 2 , or of MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 . We obtained crystals under the both conditions and determined the structures at ~ 1 . 5 Å resolutions ( Fig . S2e and f ) . However , electron densities assignable for G2 was totally missing in these structures , due to a proteolytic digestion occurred dur - ing the crystallization process ( Fig . S3 ) . We thus refer to these structures as G3 Ca or G3 CaMg . At either cation condi - tion , structures are highly similar to that of G3 in the G1 – G3 and actin complex ( Cα RMSD = 0 . 39 Å for G3 Ca and G3 3ffk , 0 . 57 Å for G3 CaMg and G3 3ffk ) . The type - 2 site in G3 Ca and G3 CaMg is occupied by Ca 2 + and the G3 long helix adopts a straight conformation ( Fig . S2e and f ) . F2 – F3 structure in the presence of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + We crystallized F2 – F3 in the presence of Mg 2 + , the most abundant divalent cation in most eukaryotic cytosol , in addi - tion to Ca 2 + . The crystallization solution contained MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 at equal concentrations ( 10 mM ) . We could not obtain the F2 – F3 crystal in the absence of CaCl 2 . The struc - ture ( referred to as F2 – F3 CaMg ) was solved at 1 . 85 Å resolu - tion . The overall structure of F2 – F3 CaMg is almost identical to that of F2 – F3 C a , with a Cα RMSD of 0 . 09 Å ( Fig . 4a ) . F2 – F3 CaM g coordinates three metals at the identical positions Fig . 4 Crystal structure of F2 – F3 CaMg . a Crystal structure of F2 – F3 CaMg ( F2 ; green , F3 ; cyan ) is superimposed onto F2 – F3 Ca ( gray ) . Coordinated metals , all Ca 2 + , are shown as spheres . b and c Electron density maps around the inter - domain site . Mg 2 + ( b ) or Ca 2 + ( c ) was assigned at the inter - domain site . F o – F c positive difference electron density map ( contoured at 4 σ ) are shown in green . Note that a strong F o – F c positive peak was observed in ( b ) , indicating that Mg 2 + is too small to interpret this density 160 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 153 – 162 1 3 in F2 – F3 Ca ; two calcium ions at type - 2 sites and one addi - tional metal at the inter - domain site . Owing to the high reso - lution of F2 – F3 CaMg , we could distinguish the cation species coordinated at the novel site . When we assigned Mg 2 + at this site , a strong positive peak was observed in the F o – F c difference electron density map ( green in Fig . 4b ) . This posi - tive peak disappeared when we assigned Ca 2 + to this site ( Fig . 4c ) , indicating that the inter - domain site in F2 – F3 CaMg coordinates Ca 2 + , not Mg 2 + . The result clearly shows that the novel inter - domain metal site prefers Ca 2 + for completing its octahedral coordination sphere . Small‑angle X‑ray scattering analysis of F2 – F3 To analyse the effect of Ca 2 + on the shape of F2 – F3 in the solution , we performed small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) measurement . The F2 – F3 solutions ( 1 to 3 mg / ml ) in the presence ( 1 mM ) or absence of Ca 2 + were used for the measurement . The values of the Guinier radius of gyration ( R g ) were not significantly different between two conditions ; 2 . 15 ± 0 . 079 nm ( − Ca 2 + ) and 2 . 07 ± 0 . 037 nm ( − Ca 2 + ) ( Fig . 5a ) . This is consistent with the similar maxi - mum dimension ( D max ) values estimated from the pair dis - tance distribution function ( p ( r ) ) ; 7 . 17 nm ( − Ca 2 + ) , 7 . 07 nm ( + Ca 2 + ) ( Fig . 5b ) . These results suggest that Ca 2 + does not induce a large conformational change in the F2 – F3 mol - ecule . We failed to obtain the SAXS data from G2 – G3 due to a heavy aggregation caused by the X - ray irradiation . Our R g and D max values of F2 – F3 were similar to the reported val - ues of gelsolin G2 – G3 ( R g / D max ; 1 . 95 nm / 6 . 0 nm ( + Ca 2 + ) , 1 . 99 nm / 6 . 3 nm ( + Ca 2 + ) ( Peddada et al . 2013 ) . Discussion Ca 2 + is a key regulator for gelsolin superfamily proteins . To date , only two sites , type - 1 and type - 2 , have been implicated for the metal coordination . This work provides the first struc - tural evidence that unique Ca 2 + - binding sites , in addition to the conserved sites , are available in gelsolin superfamily proteins . In F2 – F3 Ca , the inter - domain site is fully occupied by Ca 2 + as the two type - 2 sites , under the crystallization condition containing 10 mM CaCl 2 , which is far above the physiologically relevant concentrations . It is thus important for evaluating the Ca 2 + binding affinity of the inter - domain site . We also showed that the inter - domain site prefers Ca 2 + rather than Mg 2 + ( Fig . 4 ) . Further analysis will be required for dissecting the mechanism of cation selectivity at the inter - domain site . It is unlikely that gelsolin stably binds Ca 2 + in the inter - domain site , because Ca 2 + has not been observed in reported crystal structures of G1 – G3 in Ca 2 + - saturated condition ( Burtnick et al . 2004 ; Nag et al . 2009 ) . This is in line with biochemical data demonstrating that Ca 2 + does not enhance the binding of G2 – G3 to actin ( Fig . 1 ) ( Way et al . 1992 ) . In gelsolin , residues corresponding to the inter - domain Ca 2 + - coordination in fragmin are replaced as follows : Glu221 ( F2 ) to Gln215 ( G2 ) , Asp368 ( F3 ) to Gln364 ( G3 ) and Asp371 ( F3 ) to Lys367 / Asn368 ( G3 ) ( Fig . S1 ) . A bio - chemical study showed that gelsolin type - 2 sites mutations from Asp / Glu to Asn / Gln does not completely abolish the response to Ca 2 + ( Nag et al . 2009 ) . It is thus possible that gelsolin transiently binds Ca 2 + across G2 and G3 . A simula - tion study suggested that the temporal Ca 2 + - bindings , other than at the classical sites , likely facilitate the activation of adseverin ( Chumnarnsilpa et al . 2015 ) .

The green curve was calculated from the F2 – F3 Ca structure . The D max values , obtained by the r - intercept , are fol - lowings ; 7 . 17 nm ( − Ca 2 + ) , 7 . 07 nm ( + Ca 2 + ) , and 6 . 28 nm ( F2 – F3 Ca ) 161 Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility ( 2020 ) 41 : 153 – 162 1 3 In our SAXS analysis , effect of Ca 2 + on the R g and D max values of F2 – F3 were only moderate ( Fig . 5 ) , indicating that even in the absence of Ca 2 + , the two domains in F2 – F3 adopt an orientation similar to F2 – F3 C a . This indicates that the inter - domain Ca 2 + - coordination does not function as a large conformational switch . We assume that the presence of Ca 2 + at the inter - domain site allows to dock the two nearby domains through minimizing the electrostatic repulsion ( Fig . S2a ) , and thereby facilitates the effective actin targeting . The inter - domain Ca 2 + - coordination may play a more important role in the activation process of the full - length fragmin where F1 could potentially block the packing of F2 and F3 . A generally accepted scenario for an activation process of gelsolin superfamily proteins is that upon Ca 2 + - binding to type - 2 site , the domains 3 and 6 long helix undergoes a con - formational change from a bent to a straightened form ( Nag et al . 2013 ) . However , the long helix in the isolated domain 6 of adseverin exhibits a straight conformation even in the absence of Ca 2 + ( Wang et al . 2009 ) . F3 long helix , showing a bent conformation in the presence of Ca 2 + , is another excep - tion . We showed that the bent conformation of the F3 long helix is not induced by the Ca 2 + - coordination in the inter - domain site . However , due to the lack of fragmin structure in the absence of Ca 2 + , it remains unclear whether the F3 long helix changes its conformation in response to environmental Ca 2 + concentration . Nevertheless , the structural differences between F3 Ca and G3 Ca suggest that F3 contacts with actin in a slightly different manner from G3 . Based on the primary and tertiary structure analysis of gelsolin superfamily pro - teins , it was proposed that a conserved arginine residue on the domain 2 long helix ( Arg221 in G2 ) plays a key role in the binding of domain 2 to actin ( Choe et al . 2002 ; Burtnick et al . 2004 ) . Interestingly , fragmin F2 lacks this conserved arginine ( Figs . S1 and S2a , b ) , implying that there would also be another actin targeting mechanism for F2 . Our co - sedimentation assays showed that Ca 2 + markedly enhances the binding of F2 – F3 to the filaments ( Fig . 1a – c ) . Biochemical studies demonstrated that F1 – F3 absolutely requires Ca 2 + for severing actin filaments ( Hasegawa et al . 1980 ; Hinssen 1981b ; Gettemans et al . 1995 ) . However , our results showed that F2 – F3 retained weak binding affinity to the filaments ( K d = 30 µM ) , even in the absence of Ca 2 + . In contrast to G1 – G3 that is constitutively active , the mini - mal filament severing unit of gelsolin , G1 plus the G1 – G2 linker ( G1 + ) ( Kwiatkowski et al . 1989 ) , requires Ca 2 + for the severing activity ( Peddada et al . 2013 ) . G1 + targets actin through a few residues on the G1 – G2 linker ( Irobi et al . 2003 ) . It is thus likely that , to compensate for the much reduced affinity to the filaments , G1 + absolutely requires Ca 2 + that can facilitate the binding of its G1 domain to actin . Likewise , we assume that the reduced affinity of F2 – F3 to the filaments in the absence of Ca 2 + is not sufficient to sup - port the imperfect F1 binding without Ca 2 + .
