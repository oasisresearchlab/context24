Introduction The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be an excellent organism for studies of actin dynamics mechanisms and regulation . Endocytic internalization in this organism re - quires the stepwise association of adapters , coat proteins , motor proteins , and actin nucleation – promoting factors and culminates in Arp2 / 3 - nucleated assembly of actin filaments at the endocytic site ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . Actin assembly drives plasma mem - brane invagination and initiates a feedback loop for rapid and coordinated disassembly of endocytic components and actin fila - ments . Thus , the budding yeast endocytic pathway provides a biological context within which the full range of assembly and disassembly activities can be studied using a combination of approaches including genetics and real - time imaging . A study in yeast previously showed that defects in actin filament disassembly led to defects in the rate of actin filament assembly at endocytic sites ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . There - fore , studies of actin filament disassembly provide insight into actin filament assembly mechanisms . The major mediator of actin filament disassembly at endo - cytic sites is the small actin - binding protein cofilin , whose localization to disassembling actin filaments is dependent on coronin ( Gandhi et al . , 2009 ) . Defects in cofilin function lead to defects in endocytic internalization and late steps of trafficking to the vacuole ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . In vitro , cofilin stimulates actin filament severing but does not accelerate re - lease of actin monomers from filaments ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Biochemical studies indicate that cofilin func - tions with Aip1 to stimulate rapid actin filament disassembly ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . However , the importance of this stimula - tory activity for endocytosis and the general cellular actin econ - omy remains to be established . Although actin assembly and disassembly at endocytic sites are resolvable temporally , these events cannot be resolved spatially by light microscopy . However , elimination of Sla2p , an essential link between F - actin and clathrin , results in elon - gated actin tails anchored to arrested endocytic machinery at the plasma membrane ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Actin within these tails continuously assembles via Arp2 / 3 - nucleated polymeriza - tion stimulated by nucleation promotion factors associated with the rims of endocytic pits . Rapid F - actin turnover occurs distal to the membrane and is controlled by actin - bound nucleotide hydrolysis and Pi release , which are delayed relative to actin polymerization ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . Assembly and disassembly within actin tails are resolvable spatially and readily quantified in live cells . A lthough actin filaments can form by oligomer annealing in vitro , they are assumed to assem - ble exclusively from actin monomers in vivo . In this study , we show that a pool of actin resistant to the monomer - sequestering drug latrunculin A ( lat A ) con - tributes to filament assembly in vivo . Furthermore , we show that the cofilin accessory protein Aip1 is important for establishment of normal actin monomer concentra - tion in cells and efficiently converts cofilin - generated actin filament disassembly products into monomers and short oligomers in vitro . Additionally , in aip1  mutant cells , lat A – insensitive actin assembly is significantly enhanced . We conclude that actin oligomer annealing is a physio - logically relevant actin filament assembly pathway in vivo and identify Aip1 as a crucial factor for shifting the distribution of short actin oligomers toward monomers during disassembly . Loss of Aip1 reveals a role in maintaining the actin monomer pool and an in vivo oligomer assembly pathway Voytek Okreglak and David G .

Abp1 - mRFP completely colocalizes with actin in sla2  cells ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . Flux rates determined using this approach were consistent with those obtained previously using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GFP - actin ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . The actin tails are  0 . 83 µm ( ± 0 . 14 µm ) in length , and flux rates are  55 . 2 nm / s ( ± 8 . 5 nm / s ) . Following fiduciary marks using Abp1 - mRFP bypasses the need to use GFP - actin , which is not fully functional . To analyze the role of actin disassembly in actin flux through tails , we blocked assembly using latrunculin A ( lat A ) and quantified disassembly rates . Lat A binds actin monomers ( Coué et al . , 1987 ) and actin monomers bound to profilin ( Yarmola et al . , 2000 ) and potently inhibits assembly . We imaged sla2  cells upon treatment with high levels of lat A and measured actin flux rates before lat A treatment and actin disassembly rates after Models for actin assembly in vivo invoke a strict monomer requirement . However , this idea has been challenged by in vitro studies ( Kawamura and Maruyama , 1970 ; Murphy et al . , 1988 ) , which indicate that actin filament annealing is energetically favorable ( Andrianantoandro et al . , 2001 ) . The experiments de - scribed in this study identify a new link between disassembly and assembly reactions , providing evidence that Aip1 converts actin oligomers produced by cofilin - mediated actin filament dis - assembly into monomers and that actin oligomers contribute to filament assembly in vivo . Results and discussion Within actin tails present in sla2  cells , regions of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly and cofilin - mediated filament dis - assembly are spatially separated , allowing observation by live cell fluorescence microscopy of actin flux through the tails . To quantify actin flux rates , we imaged the actin - binding protein Figure 1 . Actin assembly continues in sla2  cells treated with lat A .

The observation that actin tail assembly continues even upon exposure of cells to the highest achievable intracellular lat A levels and while net filament disassembly is occurring led us to suspect that a pool of lat A – resistant actin contributes to filament assembly . To determine whether a lat A – resistant actin pool contrib - utes to assembly at endocytic sites in wild - type cells , we simul - taneously imaged Abp1 - mRFP and the endocytic coat marker Sla1 - GFP in cells treated with 200 µM lat A . Previous data showed that prolonged lat A treatment blocks endocytic inter - nalization and stabilizes early - arriving endocytic components at the plasma membrane ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , abolishing actin assembly at endocytic sites prevents endocytic coat disassembly because actin filaments recruit endocytic coat disassembly factors ( Toret et al . , 2008 ) . Actin rapidly disassem - bled in response to lat A ( Fig . 2 and Video 3 ) . However , kymo - graphs of individual endocytic sites marked by Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - mRFP ( Fig . 2 , bottom ) showed that actin assembly was clearly detectable at endocytic sites at early ( 0 – 20 s ) , intermedi - ate ( 20 – 45 s ) , and late ( up to 90 s ) time points after lat A treat - ment . Actin assembly early after lat A treatment is able to drive internalization and disassembly of the endocytic marker Sla1 - GFP ( Fig . 2 , left ) . However , actin assembly initiated at interme - diate or late time points after lat A addition was not capable of driving internalization but did facilitate Sla1 - GFP disassembly ( Fig . 2 , middle and right ) . These data indicate that actin is able to assemble at endocytic sites in high lat A concentrations as with actin tail assembly in sla2  cells . We considered two hypotheses that could explain the con - tinuation of actin assembly in the presence of lat A . The first is that lat A binds slowly to actin monomers . The second is that lat A treatment . Actin tails in sla2  cells treated with 400 µM lat A rapidly disassembled ( Fig . 1 B and Video 2 ) . Kymograph representations illustrate that disassembly occurs directionally from the cell interior to the cell cortex , which is consistent with cofilin localization distal to actin assembly sites ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . Untreated actin tails maintain a constant length and therefore are at steady state with balanced actin assembly and disassembly rates . We reasoned that with efficient mono - mer sequestration by lat A , actin disassembly rates should equal the flux rate . However , surprisingly , we found that mean actin disassembly rates in sla2  cells treated with 400 µM lat A were significantly slower ( 22 . 9 ± 4 . 9 nm / s ; n = 14 ) than actin flux rates before lat A treatment ( 53 . 2 nm / s ± 12 . 0 nm / s ; n = 14 ) . We tested a range of lat A concentrations and found that tail dis - assembly rates never matched actin subunit flux rates ( Fig . 1 C ) . These unexpected data suggest that the apparent actin disassem - bly rate in the presence of lat A might reflect the combination of actin disassembly and an ongoing basal level of actin polymer - ization . Indeed , close examination of actin tail kymographs re - vealed that actin assembly continues in the presence of high concentrations of lat A ( Fig . 1 B ) . Actin assembly in the presence of lat A could be the conse - quence of insufficient cytoplasmic lat A concentration as a result of plasma membrane efflux pumps . We identified the multidrug resistance pump Pdr5p as the major efflux pump for lat A by test - ing sensitivity in mutants using a plate assay ( unpublished data ) and deleted it in an sla2  strain so actin disassembly rates could be measured in the presence of the highest achievable intracellular lat A concentration . Quantification of actin tail disassembly rates upon lat A treatment ( unpublished data ) revealed no effect on apparent actin tail disassembly rate even though the cells were Figure 2 .

Aip1 may function to enhance cofilin - mediated actin filament disassembly ( Kueh et al . , 2008 ) , or it might prevent reannealing lat A – insensitive actin assembly at endocytic sites and in actin tails is the result of annealing by actin oligomers , which are not sequesterable by lat A .

S2 A ) or be - tween sla2  and sla2  aip1  cells ( unpublished data ) . We also tested whether aip1  cells have altered plasma membrane per - meability ( Fig . S2 B ) or xenobiotic drug efflux rates ( Fig . S2 C ) by measuring the accumulation and efflux of rhodamine - 6G . These data indicate that Aip1 has no role in xenobiotic diffusion or efflux across the plasma membrane and suggest that the in - crease in lat A – insensitive actin assembly in aip1  cells is spe - cifically the result of a reduction in the relative amount of lat A – sequesterable actin present in the cell . We hypothesized that Aip1 might be important for con - verting oligomeric depolymerization products to actin monomers , which are sequesterable by lat A . To test this hypothesis , we used a previously developed in vitro assay ( Kim et al . , 2000 ) to probe the polymeric species present in F - actin solutions . This assay has greater sensitivity than traditional actin sedimentation assays , which are unable to accurately distinguish actin mono - mer from other low molecular mass actin oligomer species . We purified yeast actin with a cysteine substitution at position Q41 , which can be cross - linked to C341 in an adjacent actin subunit within an actin protofilament ( Kim et al . , 2000 ) . A previous study showed that this modification does not affect polymeriza - tion dynamics or interactions with actin disassembly factors ( Kim et al . , 2000 ) . Cross - linking with the thiol - specific cross - linker MTS - 2 - MTS ( 1 , 2 - ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate ) followed by SDS - PAGE analysis under nonreducing conditions resulted in a defined ladder of actin species that represents different oligomeric actin forms present in F - actin solutions under apparent steady - state conditions ( Fig . 5 A , lane 1 ) . To estimate the cross - linking efficiency , we used the SDS - PAGE gels to quantify the concentration of actin monomer present after cross - linking . This value ( 0 . 67 µM ) is similar to the apparent critical concen - tration ( 0 . 4 µM ) measured previously for yeast actin ( Chen et al . , 1993 ) , which suggests that cross - linking was efficient , particu - larly given the contribution of small oligomeric species of actin to the apparent monomer pool after denaturation and analysis by SDS - PAGE . We used this assay to probe the contribution of cofilin and Aip1 to generation of low molecular mass actin spe - cies readily sequestered by lat A . Cofilin and Aip1 act synergis - tically to stimulate actin disassembly ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . It has been proposed that this reaction could be the result of active and rapid disassembly stimulation ( Kueh et al . , 2008 ) or actin fila - ment capping ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ) . However , neither of these proposed mechanisms addresses the nature of the species pres - ent after the disassembly reactions . We hypothesized that Aip1 , in a cofilin - dependent manner , specifically stimulates an increase in low molecular mass actin species , which are readily seques - tered by lat A . Cofilin activity is strongly dependent on concen - tration ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Therefore , we compared the status of actin species present after disassembly in reactions containing increasing concentrations of cofilin both with and without Aip1 ( Fig . 5 A ) . The experimental conditions were chosen to approximate a physiologically relevant ratio of actin and Aip1 while increasing cofilin concentrations ( Goode , B . , and A . Goodman , personal communication ) . Aip1 strongly stimulated actin monomer and small oligomer accumulation at steady state . Intriguingly , although the highest concentration of of cofilin - severed actin filaments by capping the products of cofilin - mediated severing reactions ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ) , or both . Either or both of these activities might affect oligomer assembly in vivo but are not expected to alter the binding kinetics of lat A to actin monomer . We tested whether Aip1 contributes to lat A – insensitive actin assembly in sla2  cells . We first verified that Aip1 and co - filin localize to regions of actin tail disassembly in sla2  cells . Normalized fluorescence intensity of Aip1 - GFP and CFP - cofilin relative to Abp1 - mRFP showed similar localization within actin tails in sla2  cells ( Fig . 3 A ) . Simultaneous two - color imaging of Abp1 - mRFP and Aip1 - GFP in wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 B and Video 4 ) indicated that like cofilin , Aip1 is recruited temporally after actin assembly initiation at endocytic sites . This delay ( 4 . 2 ± 0 . 9 s ) ( Fig . 3 B ) is very similar to that previously reported for cofilin ( 3 . 6 ± 0 . 6 s ; Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . Analysis of Aip1 spatiotemporal dynamics with kymographs indicates that Aip1 , like cofilin , associates with actin patches during the internalization / disassembly phase of endocytic patch lifetime ( Fig . 3 B ) . Despite its presence in actin tails and patches , dele - tion of the gene encoding Aip1 resulted in no discernable actin dynamics defects in actin tails of sla2  cells ( Fig . S1 A ) or at endocytic sites ( Fig . S1 B ; Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . Therefore , Aip1 may be important for a feature of actin filament turnover that is not manifested by changes in bulk actin dynamics . We next tested the impact of Aip1 on the lat A – insensitive actin assembly pathway in actin tails . Although actin tails in sla2  cells disassemble within 90 s of lat A treatment ( Fig . 1 B and Video 2 ) , actin tails in sla2  aip1  cells take > 360 s to dis - assemble ( Fig . 4 A and Video 5 ) . Strikingly , kymographs indicate that flux is ongoing even 100 s after lat A treatment and that assembly bursts at the cortex occur even after complete tail dis - assembly ( Fig . 4 A , arrowhead ) . We next tested the impact of Aip1 on lat A – resistant actin assembly at endocytic sites . Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - mRFP were simultaneously imaged in aip1  mutant cells treated with 200 µM lat A ( Fig . 4 B and Video 6 ) . As previously reported ( Okada et al . , 2006 ) , compared with wild - type cells , actin patches in aip1  cells persist for a longer time after lat A treatment ( Fig . 2 and Video 3 ) . However , examination of the actin patch spatiotempo - ral dynamics associated with endocytic sites by kymographs ( Fig . 4 B ) indicates that rather than slowing actin filament dis - assembly , the time during which actin patches can assemble in the presence of lat A is prolonged . Indeed , actin assembly events associated with endocytic sites can take place up to 240 s after lat A addition ( Fig . 4 B , right ) . Collectively , these results sug - gest that Aip1 is important for the presence of actin species in vivo that can be readily sequestered by lat A and that this effect is manifested in actin dynamics associated with sites of endo - cytosis in wild - type cells and actin tails in sla2  cells . Addi - tionally , the lack of an appreciable effect on actin dynamics associated with endocytic sites or on actin flux rates when cells lack Aip1 indicates that a defect in generation of a lat A – sensitive actin pool does not affect bulk actin dynamics . To rule out a role for increased actin levels in lat A – insensitive actin assembly seen in aip1  and sla2  aip1  cells , we quantified total cellular actin concentrations and found no on J u l y 9 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m JCB • VOLUME 188 • NUMBER 6 • 2010 774 Figure 4 . aip1  cells show an increase in lat A – insensitive actin assembly .

To measure actin tail shrinkage rates in the presence of lat A , time - lapse data were corrected for photobleaching , a fluorescence threshold was applied to kymographs , and the position of the cytoplasmic end of the actin tail over time was determined . Protein purification and expression Yeast Q41C actin , cofilin , and Aip1 were purified as described previously ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Kim et al . , 2000 ) . All proteins were gel filtered on columns ( Sephadex 200 ; GE Healthcare ) . G - actin was maintained under constant dialysis in argon - flushed dialysis chambers and used within 1 wk of purification .

Cofilin and Aip1 were added to concentrations indicated in Fig . 5 A , and reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min . All reactions were adjusted to the same final volume to minimize dilution effects . MTS - 2 - MTS was added to 1 . 5 mM , and cross - linking was quenched after 1 h with 3 mM N - ethyl - maleimide . Samples were loaded onto 4 – 12 % gradient gels ( Bio - Rad Labora - tories ) and run under nonreducing conditions . Gels were stained with Sypro ruby ( Invitrogen ) and imaged on a variable mode imager ( Typhoon 9400 ; GE Healthcare ) . PAGE quantification was performed using ImageQuant software ( GE Healthcare ) . Actin cross - linking in living cells act1 - Q41C and act1 - Q41C aip1  cells were grown to OD 600 = 0 . 5 in YPD , and 8 ml of cells was centrifuged at 1 , 500 g . The cells were washed two times with PBS supplemented with 1 M sorbitol ( S - PBS ) and resus - pended to 8 OD 600 / ml in S - PBS . MTS - 2 - MTS was added to 1 mM , and cross - linking was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 2 min . The cross - linking reaction was quenched for 1 min by adding N - ethylmaleimide to 10 mM , after which ice - cold TCA was added to 15 % final concentra - tion . The cells were lysed by bead beating with 425 – 600 - µm acid - washed glass beads ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 15 min at 4°C . The precipitated cell lysate was spun at 14 , 000 g for 15 min and washed once with  20°C acetone . Pellets were air dried , resuspended in 80 µl TURB ( 62 . 5 mM Tris – HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 3 M urea , and 1 % SDS ) , and boiled for 3 min at 98°C . The samples were spun at 1 , 500 g for 5 min at 4°C , and 60 µl supernatant was col - lected . 30 µl of the supernatant was reduced with 5 %  - mercaptoethanol and reboiling . Equal amounts of reduced and nonreduced samples were loaded on 10 % SDS - PAGE gels , transferred to PVDF membrane , and immuno - detection of relevant proteins was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for detection using an infrared imaging system ( Odyssey ; LI - COR Biosciences ) . Quantification of immunoblot data was performed using ImageJ . DNase I inhibition assays Wild - type and aip1  cells were grown to OD 600 = 0 . 5 in YPD , centrifuged at 1 , 500 g , and washed once with FSB ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM KCl , 100 µM CaCl 2 , and 1 . 2 M sorbitol ) . The cell pellet was resuspended in 450 µl FSB to which 50 µl 10 mg / ml zymolyase 100T ( Seikagaku Corporation ) was added . Cells were spheroplasted at 30°C for 30 min , spun at 1 , 500 g for 5 min , and washed once with FSB contain - ing 30 µM phalloidin . Cells were resuspended in 100 µl FSB + 30 µM phalloidin , and  0 . 5 - µm glass beads were added . The slurry was vor - texed for 30 s , incubated for 30 s on ice , and this cycle was repeated three more times . The lysate was centrifuged at 1 , 500 g for 5 min . The resulting supernatant was further clarified by spinning once at 5 , 000 g for 5 min and again at 5 , 000 g for 10 min . Protein concentration was quantified in triplicate using protein assay ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) , and extracts were normalized to 10 mg / ml using FSB + 30 µM phalloidin . Extracts were used immediately and were not allowed to remain on ice for > 1 h . 200 µl of 100 nM DNase I ( Boehringer Ingelheim ) was added to 800 µl of 25 µg / ml herring sperm DNA . A 260 values were measured for 1 min immedi - ately after mixing using a spectrophotometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . 1 µl cell extract was used for the inhibition assay . Plasma membrane permeability assays Rhodamine - 6G uptake was measured as described previously ( van den Hazel et al . , 1999 ) with the following modifications . 20 OD 600 of wild - type and aip1  cells were harvested and washed three times with 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 . The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of deenergizing buffer A ( 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 1 µM antimycin A [ Sigma - Aldrich ] , and The relative fold increase of each actin species is quantified in Fig . 5 A . We tested whether the increase in actin monomer concen - tration catalyzed by Aip1 was of physiological relevance by comparing the actin monomer concentration by chemical actin cross - linking in living act1 - Q41C and aip1  act1 - Q41C cells . Consistent with differences in in vitro actin disassembly reac - tions presented in Fig . 5 A , we found that aip1  cells have  45 % less actin monomer ( Fig . 5 B ) . We verified the decrease in actin monomer concentration in aip1  cells by assessing the actin monomer concentration in extracts prepared from wild - type and aip1  cells using DNase I inhibition assays ( Blikstad et al . , 1978 ) and found that cell extracts from aip1  cells have  15 % less DNase I inhibitory activity than extracts from wild - type cells ( Fig . S3 ) . This value is likely an underestimation of the actual change in actin monomer concentration as a result of DNase I inhibition by oligomeric actin ( Morrison and Dawson , 2007 ) . Collectively , these results suggest that Aip1 is important for gen - erating actin monomers , the species that is sequesterable by lat A , and that a defect in generating actin monomer has no readily detected effect on bulk actin dynamics in vivo . These data and the increase in lat A – insensitive actin assembly in sla2  aip1  and aip1  cells imply that actin oligomers participate in actin filament assembly in vivo . In addition , we provided evidence that actin oligomer assembly occurs even when the full comple - ment of actin disassembly factors is present in the cell . Our data indicate that a previously unappreciated actin assembly pathway exists in living cells and participates in assem - bly of Arp2 / 3 - generated actin filament arrays . This observation raises key questions about the role of the assembly competent actin oligomer pool in vivo . In photobleaching experiments of actin tails , no recovery is seen distal to the plasma membrane , indicating that filament assembly is restricted to membrane - proximal regions ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , Aip1 is reported to cap filament barbed ends generated by cofilin - dependent filament severing in vivo ( Tsuji et al . , 2009 ) , which may bias oligomeric actin assembly events toward regions of actin filaments lacking Aip1 and cofilin . However , the detailed inter - play between actin monomer and oligomer in Arp2 / 3 - promoted nucleation and elongation of uncapped filament barbed ends near membranes remains to be elucidated . Materials and methods Yeast strains , media , and plasmids Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S1 . Unless otherwise noted , all strains were grown at 25°C in synthetic dextrose media supple - mented with appropriate amino acids . The CFP - cofilin construct was made as previously described ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) , but pDH3 ( Yeast Resource Center , University of Washington , Seattle , WA ) was used as a PCR template to generate CFP . Quantitative analysis of actin dynamics in vivo All images were acquired on an epifluorescence microscope ( IX71 ; Olym - pus ) equipped with a 100× NA 1 . 4 objective and a camera ( Orca II ; Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Cells were immobilized on concanavalin A – coated glass coverslips and imaged using appropriate filter sets and neutral den - sity filters . Actin flux rates were quantified by following fiduciary marks generated by discontinuous actin assembly at the cell cortex using kymo - graphs generated with ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) . Lat A – induced actin disassembly was performed as described previously ( Okreglak and on J u l y 9 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 777 Actin oligomer assembly in vivo • Okreglak and Drubin Kaksonen , M . , Y .
