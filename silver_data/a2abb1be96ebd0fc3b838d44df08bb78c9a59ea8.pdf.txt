Paul , MN , USA ; c Kelley School of Business , Indiana University , Bloomington , IN , USA ABSTRACT Teams have increasingly turned to computer - mediated communica - tion ( CMC ) to work when team members cannot all be in the same physical space at the same time , leading to the need to better under - stand what influences group performance in these settings . We know that team member intelligence and personality affect team perfor - mance when teams work face - to - face , but their effects are not yet clear when teams use text - based CMC , which has different characteristics than face - to - face communication . We conducted a laboratory study of 61 teams working on a decision - making task using text - based CMC . We found that team mean extraversion had a large negative effect , and team mean neuroticism had a medium - sized negative effect on team performance . Team mean intelligence had no effect . We recommend that managers consider the effects of extraversion when selecting team members and focus on selecting more introverted team mem - bers if the team is likely to extensively use text - based CMC . Likewise , managers should consider extraversion when designing teamwork processes for virtual teams ; if a team has many members who are high in extraversion , the team should use text - based CMC sparingly . We also recommend that researchers use extraversion as a control factor in future research studying text - based CMC because extraver - sion has a large effect on team outcomes and , left uncontrolled , could increase unexplained error variance and overshadow the focus of the research study . KEYWORDS Virtual teams ; personality ; intelligence ; extraversion ; introversion ; computer - mediated communication ; team performance ; group performance Introduction The increase in remote work , given greater urgency by the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 79 ] , means that teams often use some form of computer - mediated communication ( CMC ) , such as email , texting , or Web forums , in addition to or in place of face - to - face communication , especially when team members are separated by location and / or time [ 25 , 68 , 96 ] . Working using CMC can lead to challenges for teams [ 33 , 68 ] . The CMC context has unique properties , such as parallelism , synchronicity , speed of response , organization , and how language is used [ 1 , 38 ] , so some individuals may embrace CMC , while others may believe it does not fit how they work best . Variance exists between teams as well , with some teams demonstrating great success when using CMC , while other teams struggle [ 77 ] . CONTACT Alan R .

Even though video and audio communication technologies are becoming more advanced , we are using text - based CMC more than ever . Texting has now become more common than phone calls , for both personal use and communicating business needs ; over 25 billion text messages are sent each day . 1 E - mail is still a preferred method in business organizations ; the average office worker receives dozens of e - mail messages per day . 2 Popular collaboration technologies built for organizational team decision - making , such as Microsoft Teams , are constantly being updated with new instant - message , text conversation thread , and within - call chat functionalities . 3 Meetings held over video in Teams or Zoom often include a plethora of text chat messages between some or all group members , meaning text - based CMC is central to team decision - making [ 39 ] . Even when meetings are held with video technology , these meetings are often supplemented , prefaced , or followed with text communication through e - mails , IMs , or text messages . Characteristics of any form of CMC can lead teams to develop different norms and working patterns [ 1 , 38 , 105 ] . Team composition has long been known to play a large role in the effectiveness of teams [ 17 , 82 , 87 ] . A team’s composition affects not only the skills they bring , but the effort they exert and their ability to work together to solve problems [ 13 , 61 ] . Although surface - level differences in team composition ( e . g . , demographics ) can affect team performance , deep - level characteristics such as personality have been found to have larger impacts [ 13 , 63 ] . In face - to - face teams , no deep level characteristics have been more widely studied than intelligence and personality [ 17 ] , with these two factors being frequently studied conjointly [ e . g . , 13 , 75 , 83 , 85 , 108 ] . Intelligence enables team members to understand the task and develop solutions , while personality shapes how they communicate solutions and reach consensus on a team decision . Subsequent research has shown that intelligence and personality ( specifically extraversion and neuroticism ) influence team performance when teams work face - to - face [ 17 , 43 , 128 ] , but depending on whether the two are studied separately or concurrently , the resulting influences can vary [ 112 ] . Taken together as a set of traits , intelligence and personality have a medium to large effect on team performance [ 10 , 11 , 17 ] . Media Synchronicity Theory ( MST ) argues that text - based CMC differs from face - to - face communications on five theoretical dimensions ( rehearsability , reprocessability , symbols sets , transmission velocity , and parallelism ) [ 38 ] , which is why some findings from face - to - face research generalize to CMC , but others do not [ 40 , 53 , 105 ] . Past research on teams working face - to - face shows that intelligence and personality together have strong effects on performance [ 13 , 17 ] , yet no study has examined their joint effects on team performance when teams use CMC . Personality and intelligence may be one reason why past research with virtual teams shows that technology use has inconsistent effects [ 40 , 53 , 105 ] —the combined effects of intelligence and personality may overwhelm the effects of the technology . In this study , we investigate the joint effects of team member intelligence and personality when teams use text - based CMC . Our research question is : RQ : Do intelligence and personality influence performance when teams use text - based CMC ? Understanding the combined effects of intelligence and personality when teams use text - based CMC will show whether these factors are fruitful avenues for future CMC research . It will also suggest factors that researchers should use as controls in future CMC research that is not focused on personality or intelligence . Managers are usually good at identifying JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 103 employees who are high or low in certain personality traits [ 93 ] ; as a result , if these traits influence team performance , managers can use those characteristics when assigning staff to teams [ 48 ] and when they decide what mix of communication technologies a given team will use . We followed past research [ 17 ] and designed a laboratory experiment with what Klein and Kozlowski [ 78 ] would refer to as a single - level study , where all predictors and outcomes are studied at the team level . Student subjects were placed into teams and asked to complete a hidden profile [ 116 ] compensatory decision - making task [ 117 ] . Subjects completed intelligence and personality measures prior to participating in the main task and then were randomly assigned to work in teams that used text - based CMC for all interactions . Constructs that were collected at the individual level were aggregated into what Klein and Kozlowski [ 78 ] call “shared constructs” ( e . g . , team intelligence , team extraversion , etc . ) , and performance ( a “configural construct” ) was measured at the team level , thus allowing for analysis at the team - level . Our results show that one personality factor ( extraversion ) has what Cohen [ 26 ] terms a “large” negative effect on team performance . Teams with higher mean extraversion performed significantly worse . Each standard deviation increase in a team’s mean extraver - sion reduced decision quality by 20 percent . Interestingly , this is the opposite pattern from face - to - face communication , where increases in team mean extraversion have been shown to improve decision quality [ 17 ] . Our results also show that neuroticism has what Cohen [ 26 ] terms a “medium” negative effect on team performance . However , team mean intelli - gence failed to have a significant effect on team performance . These effects were robust , remaining consistent in a model which also included the variance of each of these con - structs , and when considering the interactions of personality with intelligence . Taken together , this suggests that text - based CMC is a fundamentally different context from face - to - face communication . Rather than assuming that prior research using teams working face - to - face can reliably predict results for teams using text - based CMC , our research illustrates the importance of understanding how the theoretical mechanisms of text - based CMC interact with extraversion to produce worse performance . Therefore , we encourage researchers to devote more research to understanding how person - ality influences the outcomes of virtual teamwork . We also encourage researchers not interested in personality to include a measure of extraversion in team studies to reduce unexplained error variance—even a short form measure , which can be as simple as two questions [ 106 ] . One reason research may have difficulty finding improvements in decision quality from the use of collaboration technology [ 41 , 42 ] may be because extraversion creates large unexplained error variance that overshadows the effects of technology . Likewise , we encourage managers to consider the extraversion of team members when they select team members for projects and when they design a team’s work processes . Use text - based CMC sparingly for teams whose members are predominately high in extraversion , and use text - based CMC frequently for teams whose members are predominately high in introversion . Theoretical Background A team’s composition is critical in predicting team performance [ 17 , 82 ] because it determines “the amount of knowledge and skill team members have to apply to the team task—in terms of both task completion and working interdependently” [ 17 , p . 596 ] . 104 DENNIS ET AL . Research on team member intelligence and personality has continued to grow , with these factors representing two of the most frequently studied composition variables when pre - dicting team performance [ 17 ] . It is important to consider intelligence and personality simultaneously—results from studying personality and intelligence individually can differ significantly from when they are examined concurrently [ 112 ] because team performance is a joint function of both [ 17 ] . In the following sections , we consider the role of intelligence and personality in team decision - making . We then provide a brief overview of past research using CMC . Intelligence Individual intelligence ( also called cognitive ability [ 36 ] or general mental ability [ 13 , 17 ] ) is the ability to perform cognitive tasks [ 36 , 115 ] . Individuals with higher intelligence are better able to consistently perform cognitive tasks well [ 17 ] , so they are higher performers in job settings that require cognitive performance : “After hundreds of empirical studies , it is now clear that cognitive ability is one of the best predictors of individual job performance” [ 43 , p . 507 ] . The same ability that enables individuals to perform well on individual cognitive tasks should also be relevant for similar cognitive tasks that are assigned to teams [ 17 , 43 , 118 ] . Team output is a function of the individual contributions of its members ; as a result , when individual team members produce better outputs , the resulting team performance should be improved [ 83 ] . Therefore , we theorize that teams comprised of more intelligent people who are higher individual performers should perform better than teams comprised of less intelligent people who are poorer individual performers [ 17 , 43 , 118 ] . However , the empirical results measuring these effects have been less conclusive than one might expect [ cf . 19 , 42 , 52 , 86 , 127 ] . Meta - analyses have found modest differences in task performance due to team member intelligence [ 17 , 43 , 118 ] . The effects of team member intelligence have often varied greatly from study to study [ 7 , 8 , 49 ] . The inconsistent effects of intelligence may be because many studies have examined the effects of intelligence without considering the effects of team member personality , and studying one without considering the other may lead to different conclusions [ 112 ] . Personality Personality traits are another important individual characteristic influencing team per - formance and are capable of providing incremental predictive validity beyond intelli - gence [ 12 , 17 ] . The dominant model of personality is the Five Factor Model [ 93 ] , which has five key traits : extraversion , neuroticism ( i . e . , emotional instability ) , agreeableness , conscientiousness , and openness to experience , each of which are stable individual traits [ 29 ] . The effects of personality can vary depending on the specific context involved . For example , extraversion is most beneficial in contexts that involve social interaction [ 10 ] . Likewise , neuroticism is important in teamwork contexts [ 97 ] . Openness to experience is frequently seen as beneficial in contexts where adaptability is key [ 85 , 86 ] , but it frequently fails to show a general effect on team performance [ 17 ] . JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 105 Personality has strong influence on behavior . Often , personality characteristics create patterns of behavior such that people high in a given personality trait tend to behave and respond to others in similar ways [ 15 , 84 ] . When entering a new team without prior established practices , individuals will be faced with the need to jointly shape their team’s work practices [ 51 , 52 ] . Individuals’ personalities will shape their initial behaviors in a new team and how they react to the behavior of others [ 15 , 84 ] . The central tendency of members’ behaviors will develop the team’s common behaviors through shared interactions [ 51 , 58 ] . Thus , team mean personality traits are highly impactful in forging group norms , shaping subsequent interactions between members [ 58 ] . For example , imagine a case where many team members are high in extraversion , which is characterized by a tendency towards sociability , gregariousness , action , and excitement - seeking [ 12 , 93 ] . If many team members are high in extraversion ( i . e . , the team has a high central tendency in extraversion ) , initial behaviors are more likely to be social and gregar - ious , and the response to those behaviors would be positive , social , and gregarious . The few team members lower in extraversion are likely to avoid challenging the emerging central tendency in behavior [ 12 , 93 ] . Conversely , imagine a case where many team members are low in extraversion , ( i . e . , the team has a low central tendency in extraversion ) . Initial behaviors are far less likely to be social and gregarious , and the response to social and gregarious behaviors would be negative . The few team members higher in extraversion will see the emerging central tendency in behavior and are less likely to challenge it [ 12 , 93 ] . Past research is fairly conclusive in showing that team mean agreeableness , openness , and conscientiousness have little to no effect in short duration lab studies [ 17 ] . The shortened duration and artificial nature of lab studies mitigate the impact of these three personality traits , in part because subjects are less likely to be invested [ 17 ] . Neither sufficient time nor high enough stakes elicit the type of disagreement that agreeableness could help resolve . Likewise , the tightly bounded nature of lab studies reduces the effectiveness of openness to experience , and there is less space for the dependability and planning of conscientious individuals to have an impact [ 17 ] . Thus , we follow past research and focus on extraversion and neuroticism , while controlling for agreeableness , openness , and conscientiousness . Computer - Mediated Communication The study of teams using technology has a rich history spanning decades [ for reviews , see 40 , 41 , 53 , 102 , 103 ] . Raghuram et al . [ 105 ] categorize this research into three distinct clusters . Our research falls into what they call the computer - mediated work cluster . Within this cluster , decision quality is an important outcome that has received much research attention [ 40 , 105 ] . CMC research has long focused on text - based CMC and continues to do so today [ 3 , 34 , 55 , 76 , 101 , 105 ] . This initial focus began , in large part , because text was the first form of communication that was easily transmitted over computer networks . For much of the early days of CMC research , CMC meant text - based communication [ 76 , 101 , 130 ] . Over the last decade or two , CMC has come to include voice and video communication [ 105 ] , yet text - based CMC is still prevalent in personal and business use [ 3 , 34 ] . The social processes associated with collaboration technology and how individual team members interact can influence team performance [ 24 , 40 , 53 ] . Collaboration technology research has only recently begun to consider how deeper - level individual characteristics of 106 DENNIS ET AL . team members [ 105 ] such as intelligence [ 6 ] and personality [ 120 ] affect team processes and outcomes . However , research in CMC has examined intelligence and personality separately . For example , Barlow and Dennis [ 8 ] examined the effects of individual intelligence on performance across four types of tasks , finding that intelligence predicted performance only for certain task types . However , the study did not jointly examine personality . Intelligence and personality are important because team members are often chosen based on unique skills they bring to the team , such as functional knowledge or specific abilities [ 16 ] , and these characteristics can have meaningful effects on decision quality [ 17 ] . This diversity of information , abilities , and viewpoints can lead to better decisions [ 62 ] , but only if teams understand how to use them [ 111 ] . Like past research [ 38 ] , we assume that team members can trust one another [ 24 ] and that there is no deliberate attempt to deceive [ 130 ] . As it stands currently , both scholars and practitioners have an incomplete understanding of the effects of intelligence and personality in teams using text - based CMC , despite a plethora of research in face - to - face contexts showing that the two have medium to large effects on team performance [ 13 , 17 , 82 ] . Text - based CMC and face - to - face communication have important theoretical differences [ 38 ] , which is why some results generalize from face - to - face communication to text - based CMC , but others do not [ 40 , 41 , 53 , 102 , 103 ] ; the characteristics of the communication medium fundamentally alter what makes team inter - action effective and not effective [ 40 , 53 , 105 ] . Whether the joint effects of team intelligence and personality found in face - to - face communication translate to teams using text - based CMC is an important research gap , which this paper aims to address . Hypothesis Development We theorize that team performance is a joint function of intelligence and personality . Intelligence enables individual team members to understand the task and the information needed to complete that task [ 8 ] . Intelligence also improves the ability of team members to understand each other [ 7 ] . In turn , a team’s personality guides how their members interact with one another [ 15 , 84 ] and shapes communications and collaboration within teams [ 13 , 14 , 120 ] . Team work is co - constructed [ 122 ] and team member communication and collaboration play a central role in team outcomes [ 38 ] . Taken together , a team’s intelli - gence captures its innate ability to understand the task and solve problems , while person - ality drives how well they can apply that ability through their interactions with each other to reach consensus on a team decision . Much research has examined individuals interacting in teams [ 13 , 67 , 78 , 129 ] . Our focus is on how factors originating in the individual ( i . e . , team member intelligence and person - ality ) combine to produce a team level outcome ( i . e . , team performance ) . Thus we are studying a “bottom - up” phenomenon [ 67 , 129 ] , where factors at the lower level ( individual characteristics ) influence the outcome of interest at the collective level ( team performance ) . No statistical techniques directly enable constructs at the lower level ( e . g . , team member characteristics ) to predict outcomes at the collective level ( e . g . , team performance ) . Therefore , researchers often combine the lower level data into measures at the team level for analysis [ 17 , 67 ] . Thus , we use team intelligence , team extraversion , and so forth , to analyze the data in a single level model ( i . e . , at the collective team level ) . JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 107 Intelligence The fundamental theoretical mechanism by which team member intelligence influences team performance is through individual cognition applied to the task [ 17 ] . Team tasks are more complicated than individual tasks because team members must interact with other team members to obtain and provide information and to reach consensus on the best decision [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] . Team performance on many group tasks depend on all team members examining the information they have , exchanging relevant information , and working together to reach a decision [ 116 , 117 ] . Nonetheless , individual intelligence plays an important role as individuals assess the information that they have and consider how they can best contribute to team goals . Team members must also focus their attention and cognition on listening to other team members or they risk missing information if the information is not stored in a format for future reference [ 38 , 65 ] . Face - to - face communication suffers from dual task interference because team members must both contribute information and attend to information from other team members , so cognition and performance are impaired [ 65 ] . Media Synchronicity Theory ( MST ) argues that media affect teams in two distinct ways : by influencing individual team member information processing and by influencing communica - tion among team members [ 38 ] . Text - based CMC has high reprocessability , the extent to which a medium can be reexamined by the receiver , compared to face - to - face communication [ 38 ] . Reprocessability enables members to disengage from the discussion and pause to devote individual cognition to the task without risk of missing information because text - based CMC communication is recorded and can be read as desired [ 38 , 65 ] . Thus , text - based CMC enables team members to pause to devote their undivided attention to the individual information processing of communication from other team members [ 38 , 65 ] . They can separate the need to attend to information from others from the need to cognitively process information internally . Thus , team members can apply their full intelligence to the task during team discussions . This could strengthen the effects of intelligence because intelligence now has an unbridled effect . Alternately , this could weaken the effects of intelligence because taking time to pause requires less cognitive effort than attempting to consider the comments of one team member while listening to another [ 65 , 101 ] . When cognitive effort required to perform a task is high , those with higher intelligence perform better than those with lower intelli - gence [ 36 ] . When the cognitive effort needed is lower , intelligence is less important for good performance and those with higher intelligence may not perform noticeably better [ 36 ] . Few studies have examined intelligence in teams using text - based CMC [ 74 , 75 ] . One study found a significant effect of intelligence on brainstorming performance , an additive task [ 121 ] . Other studies examining decision - making tasks have found no significant effects [ 8 ] or found effects only when teams used a structured process [ 7 ] . We also note that few of these prior studies has examined the effects of personality and intelligence together , and considering both together can produce different results than either one alone [ 112 ] . To summarize , theory suggests that intelligence should affect team performance when teams use text - based CMC to work on decision tasks . Empirical studies of CMC present mixed results , although none of these CMC studies has considered the simultaneous effects of personality . Thus , we theorize that : Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) : Team mean intelligence is positively related to performance when teams use text - based CMC . 108 DENNIS ET AL . Personality The Five Factor Model of personality defines extraversion as an individual’s tendency towards sociability , gregariousness , social ascendancy , assertiveness , action , and excitement - seeking [ 12 , 93 ] . The key theoretical mechanism for why increased extraversion is linked to team performance lies in participation ; extraverts are more likely to participate—and dominate—in discussions [ 59 ] , because social ascendancy and dominance is a key part of extraversion [ 93 ] . Extraverts are more likely to display leadership qualities [ 72 , 93 ] and share information [ 5 ] because they are more willing to speak . At the same time , extraverts frequently dominate discussions with others [ 93 ] , suppressing or neglecting ideas that come from introverts and undermining their performance [ 59 ] . In a meta - analysis of 27 studies , Bell [ 17 ] concludes that mean extraversion is positively related to team performance when teams work face - to - face . Social presence [ 113 ] , the ability of a media to transmit social cues so that team members feel the presence of others , is a social construct that is different for CMC . When teams use text - based CMC , the lack of cues such as tone , body language , and appearance makes it hard for team members to form a sense of others being present . This , in turn , means traditional social norms are less salient [ 47 , 57 , 69 ] . Team members are less likely to feel inhibitions and social pressures to conform and , thus , are more likely to become disinhibited and act without social constraints ; that is , act as their personality drives them [ 4 , 89 ] . The challenges that virtual teams face have been theorized to strengthen the relationships between person - ality traits and team performance [ 68 ] . Therefore , the effects of personality may be strong when teams use text - based CMC . MST argues that text - based CMC provides high parallelism [ 38 ] , which means team members do not need to compete for time to speak [ 38 ] . Everyone can contribute without inhibiting or being inhibited by others [ 38 , 95 ] . The primary theoretical value of extraver - sion seen in teams using face - to - face communication is increased participation , which is less likely to affect teams using text - based CMC , as participation is naturally more equal in this setting [ 95 ] . The differences in participation between introverts and extraverts are minimal in a text - based CMC context [ 95 ] , in part because extraverts cannot dominate and suppress introverts [ 38 ] . MST also theorizes that text - based CMC has high rehearsability and low transmission speed [ 38 ] . Introverts display no more anxiety than extraverts when using text - based CMC [ 110 ] , in part because this medium does not have as significant a pressure for instant responses , which allows them the necessary time for reflection and shaping of their speech [ 110 ] . Written messages can be rehearsed ( i . e . , revised and edited ) before sending [ 38 ] , reducing the importance of off - the - cuff communication that favors extraverts [ 94 ] . At the team level , extraversion will shape the team’s dynamics [ 14 ] , leading to two implications for teams using text - based CMC . First , extraverts’ desires for social dominance within teams [ 29 , 92 ] will be at least partially thwarted with text - based CMC because the technology will impair their ability to dominate others [ 95 ] ; the high parallelism in text - based communication [ 38 ] means they will be unable to prevent others from contributing [ 95 ] . Second , individuals high in extraversion are more prone to seek out social interactions at the cost of team performance [ 14 ] , so teams high in extraversion are more likely to engage in social interaction , distraction , and communications not focused on the task . Extraverts find text - based CMC less natural , viewing it as restrictive and perceiving the quality of communication to be lower [ 2 , 44 ] , thus harming their ability to contribute . JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 109 In contrast , teams high in introversion could thrive when using text - based CMC [ 2 ] . For decision - making tasks that are compensatory hidden profile tasks , the active involvement of all team members improves performance [ 116 ] , and text - based CMC better enables the involvement of all members , especially introverts [ 95 ] . Introverts’ natural tendency towards introspection [ 22 ] would not be overwhelmed by more dominant extraverts . Introverts are more willing to listen to others’ opinions and ideas , taking them into account when making decisions [ 59 ] . Introverts tend to act more deliberately , carefully considering the factors involved rather than getting caught up in the passions of the moment [ 73 , 91 ] . The speech used by introverts is typically more precise and richer in information [ 66 ] , but the benefits of this are not as easily witnessed in teams working face - to - face where introverts are often spoken over [ 17 ] . In a text - based CMC environment where introverts are not dominated by extraverts , these same tendencies enable more introverted teams to excel . The medium of communication is conducive to the more methodic approach favored by introverts , allow - ing the team to benefit from their increased fluency of communication [ 2 ] . The net result of the high parallelism , high rehearsability , and low transmission speed of text - based CMC [ 38 ] is that introverts find it freeing and are more comfortable expressing themselves [ 2 ] . Thus , we theorize that the benefits of extraversion seen in face - to - face communication ( greater participation ) will not transfer to text - based CMC ; therefore , previous empirical findings of higher performance from more extraverted teams will not generalize to CMC . Thus : Hypothesis 2a ( H2a ) : Team mean extraversion is negatively related to team performance when teams use text - based CMC . Neuroticism , the inverse of emotional stability [ 93 ] , is an individual’s propensity to respond with negative emotions to threat , frustration , and loss [ 88 ] . The theoretical mechanisms that link higher neuroticism to lower team performance are reduced team coordination and worsened team atmosphere [ 100 ] . Neuroticism is expressed through insecurity , poor emotional control , and anxiety [ 93 ] . This negative response means that individuals who are high in neuroticism exhibit greater distress [ 60 ] and lower satisfaction [ 88 ] . As a result , performance of more neurotic people suffers in jobs that require inter - personal interaction [ 97 ] . Theory suggests that neuroticism would have similar effects when teams use CMC . The additional stress associated with working in a virtual team could strengthen the negatives associated with neuroticism [ 68 ] . Neurotic individuals tend to exhibit more anxiety and discomfort when using technology [ 80 , 81 ] , so using text - based CMC can present sub - stantial challenges to them . Emotions can be contagious , so when one neurotic team member experiences a negative reaction in response to a problem , the reaction is liable to spread to others , especially those high in neuroticism who respond poorly to negative emotions [ 119 ] . Teams high in neuroticism will feed off of one another , leading to an atmosphere of higher stress and anxiety [ 13 , 107 , ] . This , in turn , can lead to tense working environments that make teams less likely to develop good working patterns [ 13 , 123 ] , as the individuals have likely developed an anxious approach to work and , lacking countervailing influences , replicated the approach in their team . Conversely , when teams are low in neuroticism , even if one member were to experience a negative reaction to an event , other team members would be less likely to respond poorly , allowing the team to develop and maintain a more constructive approach to teamwork [ 107 , 108 ] . 110 DENNIS ET AL . Social support can buffer individuals against the negative consequences of neuroticism [ 27 ] . However , MST argues that text - based CMC is low in the range of symbol sets , the number of ways a medium allows information to be encoded ( e . g . , text , audio , visual ) , [ 38 ] , making it difficult to express emotion and provide social support when using text - based CMC [ 38 ] . This increases the fragmentation and isolation of employees who use text - based CMC [ 126 , 127 ] . In summary , teams higher in neuroticism are less capable of working together effectively [ 13 ] . A meta - analysis shows that teams with a higher mean neuroticism demonstrate lower performance [ 17 ] . The negative effects of higher mean neuroticism are likely to be exacer - bated by text - based CMC [ 38 , 80 , 81 ] ; as a result , we would theorize the negative effects of team neuroticism will generalize to situations when teams use text - based CMC . Thus : Hypothesis 2b ( H2b ) : Team mean neuroticism is negatively related to team performance when teams use text - based CMC . Method Participants Participants were 235 undergraduate students from two large US university business schools . Students were randomly organized into 61 teams of three or four members . About 42 percent were female . Task and Performance Measures To assess team performance , we focus on the quality of decisions made by teams performing multicriteria decision - making tasks using text - based CMC , specifically selecting one or more alternatives from a set of already identified options . Decision - making tasks ( e . g . , personnel selection , project selection ) are commonly assigned to teams because teams have access to more information than any one individual acting alone [ 62 ] . One long - standing line of research has demonstrated the common information problem , where teams focus on common information known to all team members at the start of a discussion and have difficulties integrating unique information known to only a few members , with these difficulties greatly impairing performance [ 37 , 111 ] . This problem occurs in both face - to - face team interaction [ 116 ] and many forms of CMC [ 37 , 111 ] . Overcoming this problem requires groups to gather and synthesize information from different team members [ 116 ] . Much of our theorizing regarding the effects of personality and intelligence focuses on their effects on members’ willingness and ability to speak up and be listened to , making this type of task an appropriate situation to test our hypotheses . Therefore , we used the college admissions task , a compensatory [ 117 ] hidden profile task [ 116 ] . A hidden profile task is a task in which each team member first considers a set of incomplete information , and then the team comes together to make a final decision . Incomplete information includes both common information , known to every team member , and unique information , known to only a subset of team members [ 116 ] . No information contradicts any other information . The college admissions task has been used in research studies for decades [ 54 , 64 , 131 ] . Team members were each given a set of information about eight hypothetical candidates JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 111 applying to a university . Participants were then asked to decide which candidates to admit and which to deny . Teams could admit at most four of the eight candidates and were given 20 minutes to make their decision . Most teams chose to admit four candidates , but some admitted three and rejected five . Teams communicated using only the chat function of Google Hangouts , which is a commonly used text - based CMC tool and a tool used in previous CMC research [ 21 ] . Google Hangouts has two parts . A large window at the top of the screen displays all user comments in chronological order , and a smaller window at the bottom allows users to type comments . Generic Google accounts were used for the study ( e . g . , teammember . a1 ) to ensure that individuals were anonymous . Teams received one point for each correct decision ( admit or deny ) , resulting in a performance score ranging from zero to eight . The correct decision for each of the candidates was based on the criteria for admitting students at the university and validated by university admissions officers . The college admissions task is appropriate for the participants because students are familiar with the criteria relevant to being admitted to the university [ 54 , 64 , 131 ] . Independent Variables We used the team mean value for all independent measures . As discussed above , the measurement of individual characteristics should match the group task ; the task was a compensatory task , making team mean more appropriate than team minimum , max - imum , or variance [ 35 ] . For this reason , most prior research on individual characteristics in teams has used team mean [ 17 ] . Using the team mean enables our results to be easily compared to previous studies in this research stream . Table 1 shows a summary of scales and measurement approaches . Individual intelligence is the ability of an individual to perform well across a variety of cognitive tasks [ 43 , 128 ] . Participants completed the Wonderlic Personnel Test ( WPT ) , a cognitive ability exercise that has been validated by academic researchers [ 45 , 46 ] and used in numerous studies [ 20 , 114 , 128 ] . The version of the WPT used in this study ( WPT - Q ) consists of 30 questions to be answered in a period of 8 minutes . Because the WPT items are proprietary , we cannot include the items used in our experiment . However , Wonderlic provides sample questions . 4 For each team , the mean score was calculated . The Big Five Personality constructs were measured using items from John et al . [ 70 , 71 ] . These items have been extensively validated in prior research over the last 30 years and represent a consensus by dozens of researchers as appropriate measures of these personality constructs . For all scales , subjects were presented with a series of items and asked whether they agreed that they were someone who exhibited the trait using a scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) . The extraversion subscale consists of 8 items , with a sample item of “I see myself as someone who is talkative . ” The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was . 88 . The neuroticism subscale consisted of 8 items , with a sample item of “I see myself as someone who worries a lot . ” The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was . 79 . Table 2 presents an exploratory factor analysis showing that the items for extraversion and neuroti - cism each loaded on their respective factors with minimal cross loadings . The team mean was used for each of these . 112 DENNIS ET AL . In general , team mean agreeableness , openness , and conscientiousness have little to no consistently significant effects in short duration lab studies [ 14 ] but may influence individuals’ interactions using CMC [ 56 , 90 ] , so we included them in our analyses for control purposes . All three showed adequate reliability : agreeableness ( . 78 ) , conscientious ( . 76 ) , and openness ( . 74 ) . Table 2 shows the items for these three scales generally loaded together , but there are some cross loadings . The items for these factors are well - established in past research ; because the items are designed to capture six sub - constructs for each Big Five Factor [ 70 , 71 ] , it is not surprising that they may not load well . We included all items to ensure construct validity ; dropping items would mean that one or more of the six sub - constructs was not included in the construct . The team mean was also used for these . Past research on intelligence has also examined two other characteristics : the proportion of females in the team and social sensitivity [ 8 , 49 , 128 ] . Past research suggests that the percentage of females can influence performance [ 128 ] with social sensitivity fully mediat - ing the effect of gender composition on performance [ 128 ] . We included both for control purposes . Proportion of females was the proportion of members in each team who reported their gender as female . Social sensitivity is the ability to perceive and understand the feelings and viewpoints of others , measured using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test [ 9 ] , a 36 - item measure that consists of selecting the emotion displayed in photographs of eyes . We collected social sensitivity and used it as a robustness check because it is theoretically challenging to argue that the ability to read the emotions in eyes is useful in a text - based CMC environment where team members are unable to see each other’s eyes . As in past research , the team mean score was used [ 128 ] . Procedures Prior to reporting to the lab for the experimental session , subjects were required to individually complete a 30 - minute online survey . This survey contained the WPT intelligence test , as well as a Qualtrics survey measuring social sensitivity and the Big Five personality traits . Once subjects arrived at the computer lab where the hidden profile task took place , they were randomly assigned to teams of 3 – 4 members . At Table 1 . Variables and measurement strategies .

Once the team was finished , each individual team member completed a survey soliciting demographic variables . Procedures and tasks were refined during pilot sessions , with minor adjust - ments made to improve clarity . Table 2 . Factor loadings .

Our research design—specifically , examining CMC groups without a face - to - face comparison—has been commonly used in prior studies of the effects of personality in face - to - face teams [ see 17 ] and in text - based CMC studies of the effects of team intelligence on team performance [ e . g . , 8 ] . Like this research before us , we did not include any “control groups . ” Our focus is solely on what happens when teams use text - based CMC . Results The data were analyzed using linear regression ( a specially generalized linear model in SPSS ) because the outcome variable is a score . Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics , and Table 4 presents the multiple regression results . Cohen [ 26 , p . 413 ] says it is reasonable “to define a ‘medium’ R 2 ( or partial R 2 ) of . 15 when several IVs [ independent variables ] are involved . ” Thus , we conclude this model with R 2 = . 185 explains a medium amount of variance . H1 argued that team intelligence was positively related to team performance . The results show that team mean intelligence did not significantly affect team performance ( F ( 1 , 53 ) = 2 . 56 , p = . 115 ) . The effect size ( partial η 2 ) was . 046 , which Cohen [ 26 ] terms small . We conclude that H1 is not supported . H2a argued that team mean extraversion was negatively related to team performance . The results show that team mean extraversion significantly reduced performance ( F ( 1 , 53 ) = 8 . 35 , p = . 006 ) . The effect size was close to what Cohen [ 26 ] terms large ( partial η 2 = . 136 ) . H2a is supported . H2b argued that team mean neuroticism was negatively related to team performance , and the results support this ( F ( 1 , 53 ) = 4 . 97 , p = . 030 ) , with a medium effect size [ 26 ] ( partial η 2 = . 086 ) . H2b is supported . None of the personality factors included as control variables had a significant effect on team performance . All non - significant factors had small effect sizes , with partial η 2 ranging from . 00 to . 04 . The results show that greater proportion of females ( F ( 1 , 53 ) = 4 . 12 , p = . 047 ) led to higher performance ( see Table 4 ) , with a medium effect size . Table 3 . Descriptive statistics .

First , because social sensitivity has been used to explain why the percentage of females in a team is important , we replaced the percentage of females with team mean social sensitivity and redid the analysis . Social sensitivity was not significant ( F ( 1 , 53 ) = 0 . 55 , p = . 464 ) and its effect size was small ( partial η 2 = . 010 ) . Thus , the proportion of females had significant effects , but these effects were not mediated by social sensitivity . Second , because the variance of team personality characteristics can affect team perfor - mance in face - to - face teams [ 17 , 98 ] and in teams using CMC [ 120 ] , we conducted a robustness check which included team variance for all personality variables and intelli - gence in addition to team means . Klein and Kozlowski [ 78 ] note that even when team mean is the most appropriate aggregation , variance cannot be fully captured using team mean values alone because a team with extremes in any factor is equivalent statistically to a team where all team members fall near the mean . Thus , team variance may be important in addition to the team mean . The robustness check including team variance produced the same statistical conclusions as the team means model in Table 4 . Team mean extraversion retained its effect , signifi - cantly reducing performance with a medium effect size ( F ( 1 , 47 ) = 4 . 39 , p = . 043 , partial η 2 = . 085 ) . Likewise , team mean neuroticism retained its effect , significantly reducing perfor - mance with a medium effect size ( F ( 1 , 47 ) b = 4 . 47 , p = . 040 , partial η 2 = . 087 ) . Team mean intelligence remained not significant ( F ( 1 , 47 ) = 2 . 64 , p = . 111 , partial η 2 = . 053 ) . Proportion female remained significant ( F ( 1 , 47 ) = 4 . 79 , p = . 034 , partial η 2 = . 092 ) . Team extraversion variance ( p = . 139 ) , team neuroticism variance ( p = . 925 ) , and team intelligence variance ( p = . 852 ) all had no significant effects on team performance . No other personality factors were significant ( mean or variance ) . Third , we examined the interaction of intelligence with the five personality traits , because team performance may be influenced by intelligence and personality acting jointly . We used the standardized versions of the personality and intelligence factors due to potential for multicollinearity with interactions of continuous variables [ 99 ] . This robustness check produced the same statistical conclusions as the model in Table 4 . Team mean extraversion retained its effect , significantly reducing performance ( F ( 1 , 48 ) = 6 . 12 , p = . 017 , partial η 2 = . 113 ) . Likewise , team mean neuroticism retained its effect , significantly reducing perfor - mance ( F ( 1 , 48 ) = 4 . 96 , p = . 021 , partial η 2 = . 094 ) .

The proportion of females remained significant ( F ( 1 , 48 ) = 4 . 39 , p = . 041 , partial η 2 = . 084 ) . None of the other main effects or interaction effects were significant . Post - hoc Analysis of Team Discussions As a post - hoc analysis to better understand the reasons underlying these patterns , we examined the transcripts of the team interactions to determine if teams with higher levels of extraversion or neuroticism communicated with one another in a different manner than those lower in extraversion or neuroticism . To do this , transcripts of each team’s commu - nication were coded using five categories from Putnam [ 104 ] ’s categories of group interac - tions . The first category was procedural direction , messages that request or provide information about how the team is to work ( e . g . , agendas , work steps ) . The second category was group goals , which are contributions that clarify the goals and objectives the group is trying to achieve . We included messages that clarified importance of information ( e . g . , SAT is more important than major ) in this category . The third category was task implementa - tion , which are messages that request or offer plans and implementation of actions . We coded messages concerned with seeking or providing task information as task implementa - tion because they represented the key component in performing the task . The fourth category was summaries and integrations , which are contributions that link prior com - ments together and those that summarize prior comments . The fifth category was digres - sions , which are messages that were not task related . Two research assistants who were not aware of the hypotheses independently coded the team transcripts . They were first trained on the coding scheme and then coded ten transcripts to ensure the initial inter - rater reliability was adequate . They then coded the remaining transcripts . The inter - rater reliability across all transcripts was adequate ( Cronbach’s alpha of . 94 ) . Given the propensity for extraverts to engage in social interactions with others [ 12 , 93 ] , we expected that teams higher in extraversion would engage in more digressions compared to teams lower in extraversion . At the same time , introverts’ tendency toward listening to and engaging with others’ comments [ 59 ] suggests that teams lower in extraversion would engage in more summaries and integration . The post - hoc analyses found that teams higher in extraversion had a lower proportion of summaries and integrations ( F ( 1 , 56 ) = 5 . 56 , p = . 022 ) and a higher proportion of digressions ( F ( 1 , 56 ) = 4 . 20 , p = . 045 ) . Thus , teams higher in extraversion were less likely to link together the information provided by other team members and pull together the group’s thinking . Instead , they were more likely to digress from the focal topic to discuss unrelated issues ( e . g . , small talk about length or interest level in the task at hand or joking about how to let down a candidate that would not be admitted ) . Teams with higher mean neuroticism had a lower proportion of task implementation comments ( F ( 1 , 56 ) = 5 . 93 , p = . 018 ) . Teams higher in neuroticism , characterized by a propensity to anxiety [ 93 ] and concern over mistakes [ 124 ] would likely find it more difficult to advance to the stage of sharing information and making decisions out of fear of making the wrong choice . There were no significant differences due to the proportion of females . JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 117 Discussion We examined the effects of team intelligence , extraversion , and neuroticism on team performance when teams used text - based CMC . We found that teams with lower extraver - sion and lower neuroticism had higher performance , while intelligence had no effect . The results for team mean extraversion are reversed from past research when teams commu - nicate face - to - face , although the neuroticism finding matches well to this past research [ 17 ] . We believe there are five important findings from these results . First , personality has a significant effect when teams use text - based CMC . We found that extraversion had a large negative effect on team performance . When members communicate by typing , participation is relatively equal [ 95 ] ; therefore , extraversion has few benefits ; those who excel at dominating spoken conversations no longer dominate when everyone can type . Introverts prefer using text - based CMC [ 2 ] ; they display no more anxiety than extraverts when using text - based CMC , and they are comfortable expressing themselves [ 2 ] . Second , our post - hoc analysis showed that extraverted teams engaged in more frequent diversions and made fewer summary and integration comments . This pattern may be due to lower social presence [ 113 ] and the decreased saliency of social norms [ 47 , 69 ] . In a situation with weaker social norms , extraverts defaulted towards their natural tendency : sociability and social ascendancy [ 93 ] . Great sociability means that extraverts are more friendly , cheerful , talkative , and gregarious than introverts [ 31 , 93 ] , which played out as more digressions . The more interesting difference for teams with greater extraversion is the lower number of summary and integration statements . One attribute of extraverts is social ascendancy—a desire for dominance , and a propensity to take charge , assert control , and lead others [ 30 , 93 ] . Thus , teams higher in extraversion had more dominant individuals interested in asserting their point of view , with less attention to information and opinions from others . Information from others is a key part of successful team decision making [ 116 ] , especially when teams use CMC [ 37 ] , so lower information integration leads to poorer decisions [ 111 ] . In contrast , introverts have a tendency towards attending to and engaging with others’ comments [ 59 ] . This took the form of an increase in summaries and integration , which led to better decisions . Third , we found that neuroticism had a medium - sized negative effect on team perfor - mance . Neuroticism is the propensity to respond with negative emotions to threat , frustra - tion , and loss [ 88 ] and a lack of emotional stability [ 93 ] . As with extraversion , the weaker social norms of teams using text - based CMC enable neurotic team members to act accord - ing to these innate habits . When work does not go as planned , individuals high in neuroti - cism are more likely to respond negatively and be less likely to focus on the task at hand [ 93 ] . Faced with a set of uncertain choices , neurotic individuals frequently seek to avoid making a decision out of fear of making the wrong choice [ 109 ] , as demonstrated by the fewer task implementation comments in our experiment transcripts . The unwillingness to commit to and implement a course of action inhibits teams’ abilities to move forward , harming decision quality . Fourth , team mean intelligence was not significant . Its effect size was between small and medium , so even if the use of a larger sample found it to be significant , its effects would be noticeably less important than extraversion or neuroticism . Thus , one challenge in virtual teamwork going forward is how to enable teams to better utilize team members’ intelligence . 118 DENNIS ET AL . Finally , the proportion of females significantly increased team performance with a medium effect size . Past research suggests that this increased performance is because females have greater social sensitivity [ 128 ] , but our robustness checks ruled out social sensitivity as an explanation . Thus , we conclude that females bring something else to team discussions , separate from ability and personality traits as measured by the Five Factor Model [ 93 ] . Contribution to Research Taken together , these findings make two key theoretical contributions to the study of personality and intelligence in teams . First , we show that one aspect of team person - ality generalizes from face - to - face communication to text - based CMC and one does not . By exploring the impact of the Five Factor model within the setting of teams using text - based CMC , we challenge the generalizability of some past findings from teams communicating face - to - face . Specifically , contrary to previous studies which have found that higher team mean extraversion is beneficial in teams that work face - to - face ( e . g . , [ 10 , 17 ] ) , our findings show that this effect is inverted in teams using text - based CMC . At the same time , we found that the effect of team mean neuroticism was consistent across communication mediums . By doing this , we bring the person - ality and CMC literatures together . Second , we contribute to the theory by demonstrating that team mean intelligence failed to influence performance for teams using text - based CMC , after controlling for personality . Theory and prior empirical research both suggested that team mean intelligence has a smaller effect for compensatory decision making tasks [ 17 ] because performance is also strongly affected by the interaction among team members—inter - action that is guided by personality [ 15 , 84 ] . Our paper adds to a growing body of literature that has found only modest effects of intelligence for teams performing compensatory decision making tasks , whether face - to - face [ 17 ] or using CMC [ 8 ] , as well as the mixed findings on the effects of intelligence on virtual team performance in general [ 8 , 74 ] . Limitations and Future Research This study has the normal limitations of lab studies . The sample was undergraduate business students , who are future managers and professionals but who may differ from current managers and professionals . Student samples are appropriate for testing the - ories about phenomena that are theorized to hold true across the population [ 28 ] , such as personality and intelligence . We studied a short task , which is typical of lab studies but may lead to different conclusions than longer tasks in the field [ 17 ] . Our study was also limited to only one type of CMC—a text - based chat . Other types of CMC with other media capabilities ( e . g . , audio , video ) are likely to have different results . One other limitation is that when aggregating factors to the team level using the mean , some of the nuance based on variance can be lost [ 78 ] . However , the mean was the most appropriate aggregation method theoretically for our constructs , and our robust - ness check did not indicate that variance played an important role . JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 119 Notwithstanding these limitations , we believe the study has four implications for future research . First , we need additional research to dig deeper into why teams higher in introversion performed better when using text - based CMC . Our post - hoc analyses suggest it has to do with better summation and integration of the information from others , but we need more research to better understand this , as well as how the differences in situational strength , social norms , and patterns of communication affect the influence of extraversion in CMC . This includes examining the potential mediating mechanisms and considering what other factors could moderate this relationship . We encourage scholars to consider what other “known” factors may behave differently in teams utilizing CMC , as our findings further support the idea that prior research using face - to - face teams cannot be directly applied to teams using CMC . Second , past research with groups using face - to - face communication shows that team mean intelligence influences team performance [ 17 ] but initial research with groups using CMC found mixed effects [ 7 , 8 ] . The link between team mean intelligence and performance is weaker for compensatory tasks [ 35 ] because interaction among team members strongly influences the results—interaction that is shaped by the personalities of team members [ 17 ] . Our findings add to the growing body of research ( e . g . , [ 8 , 105 ] ) that suggests team mean intelligence has little impact in teams using CMC . We need more research and theory to better understand why using text - based CMC decouples team performance from the intelligence of its members . One answer may lie in the fundamental nature of text - based CMC . We noted that text - based CMC has high reprocessability [ 38 ] , which enables team members to pause to attend to the information from others [ 65 ] . Taking time to pause requires less cognitive effort than attempting to consider the comments of one team member while listening to another [ 65 , 101 ] . When tasks require less cognitive effort , intelligence is less important for high performance [ 36 ] ; thus , by lowering the cognitive effort needed , text - based CMC may lower the importance of intelligence . Our participants were U . S . university students , who tend to have higher intelligence than non - university students [ 23 ] ; thus , once intelligence reaches a certain level , additional intelligence may not be critical to team performance on some tasks . Future research could also examine the effects of intelligence on CMC performance using a wider range of cognitively differentiated tasks . It is possible that the task selected for this research did not sufficiently stretch team members cognitively and , as a result , intelligence did not matter ; in this case , working on a more cognitively demanding task could cause intelligence to affect performance . By conducting research with a wide range of cognitively differentiated tasks , scholars would be better able to understand if this is the cause of the decoupling of team performance from members’ intelligence , or if there is some other unknown mechanism driving this ( lack of ) relationship . Third , past research on team intelligence has often focused on social sensitivity and the proportion of females in the team [ 128 ] . We found significant effects due to the proportion of females , but our post - hoc analysis found no effects due to social sensitivity . Thus , in the context of text - based CMC , we conclude that social sensitivity ( the ability to read the mind in the eyes ) is not an important factor . Other research on teams using CMC has also found different behaviors and team outcomes due to the gender composition of teams [ e . g . , 111 ] . Little of this research has simultaneously considered the effects of personality . Research suggests potential systematic differences exist between males and females , 120 DENNIS ET AL . differences that are heavily shaped by culture and role expectations [ 32 , 50 , 125 ] . Therefore , we encourage researchers investigating the effects of gender or intelligence to simulta - neously consider the effects of personality . Finally , the effects of personality on performance are large when teams use text - based CMC , so they have the potential to outweigh the effects of other factors , such as treatments . Thus , an important implication for any future research on teams using text - based CMC is that personality ( especially extraversion ) should be controlled for to reduce unexplained error variance . One way to control for personality is to use a repeated measures design , where each team is its own control . Another is to include a few questions on extraversion and neuroticism for use as controls to reduce unex - plained error variance . Implications for Practice We believe that this research has three implications for practice . Fortunately , individual traits can be informally assessed in the workplace with reasonable accuracy [ 93 ] ; extraverts are usually easy to recognize . First and foremost , choose communication media carefully . Our research shows that teams low in extraversion do better using text - based CMC . Thus , for teams comprised of mostly introverts , plan to use text - based CMC as much as possible to enable the team to achieve better performance . Likewise , the reverse is true ; for teams comprised of mostly extraverts , use text - based CMC sparingly . Second , when selecting team members for virtual team projects that are likely to involve much text - based CMC , consider selecting those likely to do well in the text - based CMC environment . Team members low in neuroticism are likely to do well in any communica - tion environment , but for virtual teams , strive to select more introverts than extraverts . Finally , professionals should note that team intelligence does not play a role in the performance of tasks when using text - based CMC . The traditional approach of using the brightest individuals on a team to boost performance is not supported by the data . Conclusion As remote work becomes more common [ 79 ] and teams increasingly utilize CMC , it is crucial that we understand how the characteristics of the media used can shape the ability of teams to work together effectively . We theorized that because of differences in the media’s theoretical dimensions , the effect of some team characteristics may be different when teams use text - based CMC . We found that greater extraversion and neuroticism impair performance when teams use text - based CMC , while intelligence has little effect . We conclude that the text - based CMC context enables introverts to better participate and encourages the quiet , reflective communica - tion that introverts prefer [ 22 ] . Managers should consider the personality of their teams before heavily using text - based CMC . While more introverted teams would likely perform well in the CMC setting , teams higher in extraversion would instead see lower performance .
